BENTLEY, WILSON, and FLEY,\r\nBangor House, Shoe Lane.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPREFACE.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn completing this work, I have to repeat my acknowledgments to those\r\nfriends and correspondents to whom I expressed my obligations in the\r\nPreface to the first volume; and I have the additional pleasure of\r\nrecording similar obligations from other channels.\r\n\r\nI beg to testify my gratitude to Sir William Maxwell, Bart., of\r\nMontreith, for some information regarding the Nithsdale family; which, I\r\nhope, at some future time, to interweave with my biography of the Earl\r\nof Nithsdale; and also to Miss Charlotte Maxwell, the sister of Sir\r\nWilliam Maxwell, whose enthusiasm for the subject of the Jacobites is\r\nproved by the interesting collection of Jacobite airs which she is\r\nforming, and which will be very acceptable to all who can appreciate\r\npoetry and song.\r\n\r\nTo Sir John Maxwell, Bart., of Pollock, and to Lady Matilda Maxwell, I\r\noffer my best thanks for their prompt and valued suggestions on the same\r\nsubject.\r\n\r\nI owe much to the courtesy and great intelligence of Mrs. Howison\r\nCraufurd, of Craufurdland Castle, Ayrshire: I have derived considerable\r\nassistance from that lady in the life of the Earl of Kilmarnock, and\r\nhave, through her aid, been enabled to give to the public several\r\nletters never before published. For original information regarding the\r\nDerwentwater family, and for a degree of zeal, combined with accurate\r\nknowledge, I must here express my cordial thanks to the Hon. Mrs.\r\nDouglass, to whose assistance much of the interest which will be found\r\nin the life of Charles Radcliffe is justly due.\r\n\r\nI have also to acknowledge the kindness of Mons. Amedee Pichot, from\r\nwhose interesting work I have derived great pleasure and profit; and to\r\nMadame Colmache, for her inquiries in the Biblotheque du Roi, for\r\noriginal papers relating to the subject. To W. E. Aytoun, Esq., of\r\nEdinburgh, I beg also to express my acknowledgments for his aid in\r\nsupplying me with some curious information regarding the Duke of Perth.\r\nThe kindness with which my researches, in every direction, have been\r\nmet, has added to my task a degree of gratification, which now causes\r\nits close to be regarded with something almost like regret.\r\n\r\nOne advantage to be gained by the late publication of this third volume,\r\nis the criticism of friends on the two former ones. Amid many errors, I\r\nhave been admonished, by my kind adviser and critic, Charles Kirkpatrick\r\nSharpe, Esq., of having erred in accepting the common authorities in\r\nregard to the celebrated and unfortunate Lady Grange. Whatever were the\r\nsorrows of that lady, her faults and the provocation she gave to her\r\nirritated husband, were, it appears, fully equal to her misfortunes.\r\nSince the story of Lady Grange is not strictly connected with my\r\nsubject, I have only referred to it incidentally. At some future time,\r\nthe singular narrative of her fate may afford me a subject of further\r\ninvestigation.\r\n\r\nI beg to correct a mistake into which I had fallen, in the first volume,\r\nrespecting those letters relating to the Earl of Mar, for which I am\r\nindebted, to Alexander Macdonald, Esq. These, a distinct collection from\r\nthat with which I was favoured by James Gibson Craig, Esq., were copied\r\nabout twelve years ago, from the papers then in the possession of Lady\r\nFrances Erskine. They have since passed into the possession of the\r\npresent Earl of Mar.\r\n\r\nAn interesting letter in the Appendix of this work, will be found\r\nrelative to the social state of the Chevalier St. George, at Rome. For\r\npermission to publish this I am indebted to the valued friendship of my\r\nbrother-in-law, Samuel Coltman, Esq., in whose possession it is, having\r\nbeen bequeathed, with other MSS. to his mother, by the well-known Joseph\r\nSpence, author of the \"Anecdotes\", and of other works.\r\n\r\n        LONDON,\r\n    _28th March, 1846._\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCONTENTS OF THE THIRD VOLUME.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                                                    PAGE\r\nLORD GEORGE MURRAY                                                     1\r\n\r\nJAMES DRUMMOND, DUKE OF PERTH                                        226\r\n\r\nFLORA MACDONALD                                                      310\r\n\r\nWILLIAM BOYD, EARL OF KILMARNOCK                                     381\r\n\r\nCHARLES RADCLIFFE                                                    480\r\n\r\nWith Portraits of Flora Macdonald, Prince Charles, and Lord Balmerino.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMEMOIRS OF THE JACOBITES.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLORD GEORGE MURRAY.\r\n\r\n\r\nThis celebrated adherent of the Chevalier was born in the year 1705. He\r\nwas the fifth son of John Duke of Atholl, and the younger brother of\r\nthat Marquis of Tullibardine, whose biography has been already given.\r\n\r\nThe family of Atholl had attained a degree of power and influence in\r\nScotland, which almost raised them out of the character of subjects. It\r\nwas by consummate prudence, not unattended with a certain portion of\r\ntime-serving, that, until the period 1715, the high position which these\r\ngreat nobles held had been in seasons of political difficulty preserved.\r\nTheir political principles were those of indefeasible right and\r\nhereditary monarchy. John, first Marquis of Atholl, the father of Lord\r\nGeorge Murray, married Amelia Stanley, daughter of Charlotte De la\r\nTremouille, Countess of Derby, whose princely extraction, to borrow a\r\nphrase of high value in genealogical histories, was the least of her\r\nmerits. This celebrated woman was remarkable for the virtue and piety of\r\nher ordinary life; and, when the season of trial and adversity called\r\nit forth, she displayed the heroism which becomes the hour of adversity.\r\nHer well-known defence of Latham House in 1644 from the assaults of the\r\nParliamentarian forces, and her protracted maintenance of the Isle of\r\nMan, the last place in the English dominions that submitted to the\r\nParliament, were followed by a long and patient endurance of penury and\r\nimprisonment.\r\n\r\nThe Marquis of Atholl was consistent in that adherence to the Stuarts\r\nwhich the family of his wife had professed. He advocated the succession\r\nof James the Second, and was rewarded with the royal confidence. Indeed,\r\nsuch was the partiality of the King towards him, that had the Marquis\r\n\"in this sale of favour,\" as an old writer expresses it, \"not been firm\r\nand inflexible in the point of his religion, which he could not\r\nsacrifice to the pleasure of any mortal, he might have been the first\r\nminister for Scotland.\"[1] After the Revolution, the Marquis retired\r\ninto the country, and relinquished all public business; thus signifying\r\nhis opinion of that event.\r\n\r\nHe bequeathed to his son, John second Marquis of Atholl, and the father\r\nof Lord George Murray, as great a share of prosperity and as many\r\nsources of self-exultation as ordinarily fall to the lot of one man. To\r\nthe blood of the Murrays, the marriage with Lady Amelia Stanley had\r\nadded a connection in kindred with the Houses of Bourbon and Austria,\r\nwith the Kings of Spain and Duke of Savoy, the Prince of Orange, and\r\nmost of the crowned heads in Europe. Upon the extinction of the\r\ndescendants of John the seventh Earl of Derby, commonly called the\r\nloyal Earl of Derby, and of his wife Charlotte De La Tremouille, \"all\r\nthat great and uncommon race of royal and illustrious blood,\" as it has\r\nbeen entitled, centred in the descendants of the Marquis of Atholl. In\r\n1726, the barony of Strange devolved upon the Duke of Atholl; and the\r\nprincipality of the Isle of Man was also bequeathed to the same House by\r\nWilliam ninth Earl of Derby. This was the accession of a later period,\r\nbut was the consequence of that great and honourable alliance of which\r\nthe family of Atholl might justly boast.\r\n\r\nThe father of Lord George Murray adopted every precaution, as we have\r\nseen,[2] to preserve the acquisitions of dignity and fortune which the\r\nlapse of years had added to his patrimonial possessions. Sixteen coats\r\nof arms, eight on the paternal side, and eight on the maternal side, had\r\ncomposed the escutcheon of his father, John Marquis of Atholl. Among\r\nthose great names on the maternal side, which graced a funeral\r\nescutcheon, which has been deemed the pattern and model of perfect\r\ndignity, and the perfection of ducal grandeur, was the name of the\r\nPrince of Orange.[3] This plea of kindred was not thrown away upon the\r\nMarquis of Atholl; he declared himself for King William, and entered\r\nearly into the Revolution. For this service he was rewarded with the\r\noffice of High Commissioner to represent his Majesty in the Scottish\r\nparliament. But subsequent events broke up this compact, and destroyed\r\nall the cordiality which subsisted between William and the head of the\r\nHouse of Atholl. The refusal of the King to own the African Company was,\r\nit is said, the reason why the Marquis withdrew himself from Court, and\r\nremained at a distance from it during the lifetime of William.\r\n\r\nThe accession of Anne brought, at first, fresh honours to this powerful\r\nScottish nobleman. He was created in 1704 a Duke, and was made Privy\r\nSeal: but the politics of the Court party changed; the Duke of Atholl\r\nwas dismissed from the Ministry, and he became henceforth a warm\r\nopponent of all the Government measures. He spoke with boldness, yet\r\ndiscretion, against the Union; and protested against a measure which, as\r\nhe conceived, gave up all the dignity and antiquity of the kingdom.\r\n\r\nDuring his proud career, a marriage with Katherine, the daughter of\r\nWilliam Duke of Hamilton, a lady of great prudence, and of eminent piety\r\nand virtue, added to the high consideration of the Duke of Atholl. Of\r\nthis nobleman, certain historians have left the highest character. \"He\r\nwas,\" says Nisbet, \"of great parts, but far greater virtues; of a lively\r\napprehension, a clear and ready judgment, a copious eloquence, and of a\r\nvery considerable degree of good understanding.\"[4] It is difficult to\r\nreconcile this description with the intrigues and bitterness which\r\ncharacterise the Duke of Atholl, in Lovat's narrative of their rivalry;\r\nnor would it be easy to reconcile the public report of many men with the\r\ndetails of their private failings. That, however, which has impugned the\r\nconsistency and sincerity of the Duke of Atholl far more than the\r\nrepresentations of Lovat, is the belief that, whilst his feelings were\r\nengaged in one cause, his professions were loud in upholding the other;\r\nthat he was double and self-interested; and that he saved his vast\r\nestates from forfeiture by an act of policy which might, in some\r\nbearings, be regarded as duplicity, in proof of which it is asserted,\r\nthat, whilst he pretended to condemn the conduct of his eldest son in\r\njoining the Rebellion of 1715, he was the chief instigator of that\r\nstep.[5] Such was the father to whom Lord George Murray owed his birth.\r\n\r\nDuring the unbroken prosperity of his House, the future General of the\r\nJacobite army was born. He was the fifth son of eight children, borne by\r\nthe first Duchess of Atholl, and was born in the year 1705. Of these,\r\nJohn the eldest, and presumptive heir to the dukedom, had been killed at\r\nthe battle of Mons, or Malplaquet, in 1709. He was a youth of great\r\npromise, and his death was a source of deep lamentation to his father; a\r\nsorrow which subsequent events did not, perhaps, tend to alleviate.\r\nWilliam, Marquis of Tullibardine, was therefore regarded as the next\r\nheir to all the vast possessions and ancestral dignities of his House.\r\nHis faithful adherence to the Chevalier St. George, and the part which\r\nhe adopted in the Rebellion of 1715, produced a revolution in the\r\naffairs of his family, which, one may suppose, could not be effected\r\nwithout some delicacy, and considerable distress.\r\n\r\nIn 1716 the Marquis of Tullibardine was attainted by an act passed in\r\nthe first year of George the First; and by a bill, which was passed in\r\nthe House of Commons relating to the forfeited estates, all these\r\nestates were vested in his Majesty from and after the twenty-fourth of\r\nJanuary 1715.[6] Upon this bill being passed, the Duke of Atholl, who\r\nhad been residing for many years with the splendour and state of a\r\nprince at his Castle at Blair Atholl, journeyed to London, and, being\r\ngraciously received by George the First, he laid his case before that\r\nmonarch, representing the unhappy circumstances of his son, and pointing\r\nout what effect and influence this might have, in the event of his own\r\ndeath, on the succession of his family, if his estate and honour were\r\nnot vested in law upon his second son, Lord James Murray, who had\r\nperformed very signal service to his Majesty in the late rebellion. This\r\npetition was received, and a bill was brought into parliament for\r\nvesting the honours of John Duke of Atholl in James Murray, Esq.,\r\ncommonly called Lord James Murray; and, as a reward of his steady\r\nloyalty, a law was passed, enacting that the act of attainder against\r\nWilliam Marquis of Tullibardine should not be construed to extend to\r\nLord James Murray or his issue. In consequence of this bill, on the\r\ndeath of the Duke of Atholl, in 1724, Lord James Murray succeeded to all\r\nthose honours and estates, which had thus been preserved through the\r\nprudence of his father, and the clemency or policy of the King.\r\n\r\nIn this divided House was Lord George Murray reared. It soon appeared\r\nthat he possessed the decision and lofty courage of his ancestry; and\r\nthat his early predilections, in which probably his father secretly\r\ncoincided, were all in favour of the Stuarts, and that no considerations\r\nof self-interest could draw him from that adherence.\r\n\r\nThe events of 1715 occurring when Lord George Murray was only ten years\r\nof age, his first active exertions in the cause of the Stuarts did not\r\ntake place until a later period. In the interim, the youth, who\r\nafterwards distinguished himself so greatly, served his first\r\napprenticeship to arms in the British forces in Flanders. In 1719, when\r\nonly fourteen years of age, a fresh plan of invasion being formed by\r\nSpain, and the Marquis of Tullibardine having again ventured to join in\r\nthe enterprise, Lord George showed plainly his attachment to the\r\nJacobite cause. He came over with the Marquis, with a small handful of\r\nSpaniards, and was wounded at the battle of Glenshiels on the tenth of\r\nJune. Of his fate after that event, the following account has been given\r\nby Wodrow,[7] who prefaces his statement with a congratulatory remark\r\nthat several of the Jacobites were by their sufferings converted from\r\ntheir error. \"At Glenshiels,\" he writes, referring to Lord George\r\nMurray, \"he escaped, and with a servant got away among the Highland\r\nmountains, and lurked in a hut made for themselves for some months, and\r\nsaw nobody. It was a happy Providence that either he or his servant had\r\na Bible, and no other books. For want of other business, he carefully\r\nread that neglected book, and the Lord blessed it with his present hard\r\ncircumstances to him. Now he begins to appear abroad, and it is said is\r\nsoon to be pardoned; and he is highly commended not only for a serious\r\nconvert from Jacobitism, but for a good Christian, and a youth of\r\nexcellent parts, hopes, and expectations.\"\r\n\r\nIt appears, however, that Lord George, however he might be changed in\r\nhis opinions, did not consider himself safe in Scotland. He fled to the\r\nContinent, and entered the service of Sardinia, then, in consequence of\r\nthe quadruple alliance, allotted to the possessions of the Duke of\r\nSavoy.\r\n\r\nMeantime, through the influence of his family, and, perhaps, on the plea\r\nof his extreme youth when he had engaged in the battle of Glenshiels, a\r\npardon was obtained for the young soldier. His father, as is related in\r\nthe manuscript account of the Highlands before quoted, \"had found it his\r\ninterest to change sides at the accession of George the First.\" His\r\nsecond brother, as he was now called, James Murray, or Marquis of\r\nTullibardine, was a zealous supporter of the Hanoverian Government,\r\nalthough it proved no easy matter to engage his Clan in the same cause.\r\n\r\nDuring many succeeding years, while Lord George Murray was serving\r\nabroad, cultivating those military acquirements which afterwards, whilst\r\nthey failed to redeem his party from ruin, extorted the admiration of\r\nevery competent judge, the progress of events was gradually working its\r\nway towards a second great attempt to restore the Stuarts.\r\n\r\nNotwithstanding the apparent tranquillity of the Chevalier St. George,\r\nhe had been continually though cautiously maintaining, during his\r\nresidence at Albano, as friendly an intercourse with the English\r\nvisitors to Rome as circumstances would permit. Most young men of\r\nfamily and condition travelled, during the time of peace, in Italy; many\r\nwere thus the opportunities which occurred of conciliating these\r\nyouthful scions of great and influential families. As one instance of\r\nthis fact, the account given by Joseph Spence, the author of the\r\n\"Anecdotes\" and of \"Polymetis,\" affords a curious picture of the\r\neagerness evinced by James and his wife, during the infancy of their\r\nson, to ingraft his infant image on the memory, and affections of the\r\nEnglish. Mr. Spence visited Rome while Charles Edward was yet in his\r\ncradle. He was expressly enjoined by his father, before his departure\r\nfrom England, on no account to be introduced to the Chevalier. Yet such\r\nwere the advances made to him, as his own letter[8] will show, that it\r\nwas almost impossible for him to resist the overture: and similar\r\novertures were made to almost every Englishman of family or note who\r\nvisited Rome at that period.\r\n\r\nIn addition to these efforts, a continual correspondence was maintained\r\nbetween James and his Scottish adherents. The Chevalier's greatest\r\naccomplishment was his art of writing letters; and he appears eminently\r\nto have excelled in that power of conciliation which was so essential in\r\nhis circumstance.\r\n\r\nMeantime Charles grew up, justifying, as he increased in stature, and as\r\nhis disposition revealed itself, the most ardent expectations of those\r\nwho wished well to his cause. One failing he very early evinced; that\r\nremarkable devotion to certain favourites which marked the conduct of\r\nhis ancestors; and the partiality was more commonly built upon the\r\nadulation bestowed by those favourites than founded in reason.\r\n\r\nIt was in the year 1741 that the royal youth, then scarcely nineteen\r\nyears of age, became acquainted with a man whose qualities of mind, and\r\nattractions of manner, exercised a very considerable influence over his\r\ndestiny; and whose character, pliant, yet bitter, intriguing and\r\nperfidious, came afterwards into a painful collision with the haughty\r\noverbearing temper, and manly sincerity, of Lord George Murray.\r\n\r\nIt was in consequence of the practice adopted by some of the hangers-on\r\nof the Chevalier's court, of luring young English or Scottish strangers\r\nto its circles, that John Murray of Broughton, afterwards Secretary to\r\nPrince Charles, was first introduced to the young Chevalier. Murray was\r\nthe son of Sir David Murray, Bart., by his second wife, a daughter of\r\nSir David Scott of Ancrum: he was at this time only twenty-three years\r\nof age, and he had lately completed his studies at Edinburgh, where he\r\nhad gone through a course of philosophy, and studied the civil and\r\nmunicipal laws. The report which prevailed that Mr. Murray had been\r\neducated with the young Chevalier was untrue; it was by the desire of\r\nhis mother, Lady Murray, that he first, in 1741, visited both France and\r\nItaly, and perfected himself in the language of those countries, then by\r\nno means generally attained by Scotchmen.\r\n\r\nMr. Murray had been brought up in the principles of the Episcopal\r\nChurch, and therefore there was less reason, than there would have been\r\nin the case of a Roman Catholic, to apprehend his being beguiled into an\r\nintimate connection with the exiled Stuarts. He had not, however, been\r\nlong in Rome before he was asked by an acquaintance whether he had seen\r\nthe Santi Apostoli, as the palace of the Chevalier was called. On\r\nanswering in the negative, he was assured that, through a knowledge of\r\nsome of the servants, a sight might be obtained of the palace; and also\r\nof the Protestant chapel, in which, as Mr. Murray heard with great\r\nsurprise, the Chevalier allowed service to be performed for such of the\r\nretinue of the young Prince as were of the Protestant persuasion. It was\r\nalso alleged that this indulgence was with the cognizance of the Pope,\r\nwho, in order to remove the barrier which prevented the Stuarts from\r\nenjoying the crown of England, was willing to allow Charles Edward to be\r\nbrought up as a Protestant. This assertion was further confirmed by the\r\nfact, that the noblemen, Lord Inverness and Lord Dunbar, who had the\r\ncharge of Charles Edward, were both Protestants; a choice on the part of\r\nJames which had produced all that contention between himself and the\r\nPrincess Clementina, with the details of which the Courts of Europe were\r\nentertained.\r\n\r\nThe family and retinue of the Chevalier St. George being then at Albano,\r\nMr. Murray was able to gratify his curiosity, and to inspect the chapel,\r\nwhich had neither crucifix, confessional, nor picture in it,--only an\r\naltar,--and was not to be distinguished from an English chapel; and here\r\nEnglish divines officiated. Here, it is said, whilst at his devotions, a\r\nslight accident occurred, which nourished a belief in presages in the\r\nmind of Charles Edward. A small piece of the ceiling, ornamented with\r\nflowers in fretwork, fell into his lap; it was discovered to be a\r\nthistle: soon afterwards, another of these ornaments became detached,\r\nand fell also into his lap; this proved to be a rose. Such omens,\r\ncoupled with the star of great magnitude which astronomers asserted to\r\nhave appeared at his nativity, were, it was thought, not without their\r\neffect on the hopes and conduct of the young Prince. One can hardly,\r\nhowever, do him so much injustice as to suppose that such could be the\r\ncase.\r\n\r\nMr. Murray expressed, it is affirmed, a considerable degree of curiosity\r\nto see the Chevalier and his two sons, who were both highly extolled for\r\ntheir natural gifts and graces; the wish was communicated, and, acting\r\nupon the principle of attracting all comers to the Court, was soon\r\nrealised: a page was sent, intimating that Mr. Murray's attendance would\r\nbe well received, and he was, by an order from the Chevalier, graciously\r\nadmitted to kiss hands. Such was the commencement of that acquaintance\r\nwhich afterwards proved so fatal to the interests of Prince Charles, and\r\nso disgraceful to the cause of the Jacobites. Such was the introduction\r\nof the young Prince to the man who subsequently betrayed his companions\r\nin misfortune. This step was shortly followed by an intimacy which,\r\nprobably in the commencement, was grounded upon mutual good-will. Men\r\nbecome perfidious by slow degrees; and perform actions, as they advance\r\nin life, which they would blush to reflect on in the day-dawn of their\r\nhonest youth.\r\n\r\nThis account is, however, derived from the statements of an anonymous\r\nwriter, evidently an apologist for the errors of Mr. Murray,[9] and is\r\ncontradicted so far as the sudden conversion of the young Scotchman to\r\nthe cause of the Stuarts, by the fact that he had all his life been a\r\nviolent Jacobite.[10] On the other hand, it is alleged by Mr. Murray's\r\nchampion, that his feelings and affections, rather than his reason, were\r\nquickly engaged in the cause of the Chevalier, from his opportunities of\r\nknowing intimately the personal qualities of the two royal brothers,\r\nCharles Edward and Henry Benedict. He was, moreover, independent of\r\ncircumstances; being in the enjoyment of a fortune of three or four\r\nhundred a year, which was considered a sufficient independence for a\r\nyounger brother, and therefore interest, it is alleged, could not have\r\nbeen an inducement to his actions.\r\n\r\nWhether from real admiration, or from a wish to disseminate in Scotland\r\na favourable impression of the Stuart Princes, it is difficult to\r\ndecide; but Mr. Murray, in 1742, dispatched to a lady in Scotland, who\r\nhad requested him to describe personages of so great interest to the\r\nJacobites, the following, perhaps, not exaggerated portrait of what\r\nCharles Edward was in the days of his youth, and before he had left the\r\nmild influence of his father's house.\r\n\r\n\"Charles Edward, the eldest son of the Chevalier de St. George is tall,\r\nabove the common stature; his limbs are cast in the exact mould, his\r\ncomplexion has in it somewhat of an uncommon delicacy; all his features\r\nare perfectly regular, well turned, and his eyes the finest I ever saw;\r\nbut that which shines most in him, and renders him without exception the\r\nmost surprisingly handsome person of the age, is the dignity that\r\naccompanies his every gesture; there is, indeed, such an unspeakable\r\nmajesty diffused throughout his whole mien and air, as it is impossible\r\nto have any idea of without seeing, and strikes those that do with such\r\nan awe, as will not suffer them to look upon him for any time, unless he\r\nemboldens them to it by his excessive affability.\r\n\r\n\"Thus much, madam, as to the person of this Prince. His mind, by all I\r\ncan judge of it, is no less worthy of admiration; he seems to me, and I\r\nfind to all who know him, to have all the good nature of the Stuart\r\nfamily blended with the spirit of the Sobieskys. He is, at least as far\r\nas I am capable of seeing into men, equally qualified to preside in\r\npeace and war. As for his learning, it is extensive beyond what could be\r\nexpected from double the number of his years. He speaks most of the\r\nEuropean languages with the same ease and fluency as if each of them\r\nwere the only one he knew; is a perfect master of all the different\r\nkinds of Latin, understands Greek very well, and is not altogether\r\nignorant of Hebrew; history and philosophy are his darling\r\nentertainments, in both which he is well versed; the _one_ he says will\r\ninstruct him how to govern _others_, and the _other_ how to govern\r\n_himself_, whether in _prosperous_ or _adverse_ fortune. Then for his\r\ncourage, that was sufficiently proved at the siege of Gaita, where\r\nthough scarcely arrived at the age of fifteen, he performed such things\r\nas in attempting made his friends and his enemies alike tremble, though\r\nfor different motives. What he is ordained for, we must leave to the\r\nAlmighty, who alone disposes all; but he appears to be born and endowed\r\nfor something very extraordinary.\"[11]\r\n\r\nIt was not long before Mr. Murray perceived that, although James Stuart\r\nhad given up all hopes of the English crown for himself, he still\r\ncherished a desire of regaining it for his son. Scotland was of course\r\nthe object of all future attempts, according to the old proverb:\r\n\r\n    \"He that would England win,\r\n    Must with Scotland first begin.\"\r\n\r\nThe project of an invasion, if not suggested by Murray, as has been\r\nstated, was soon communicated to him; and his credit attained to such an\r\nextent, that he was appointed by the Chevalier, at the request of Prince\r\nCharles, to be secretary for Scottish affairs. At the latter end of the\r\nyear 1742 he was sent to Paris, where he found an emissary of the\r\nStuarts, Mr. Kelly, who was negotiating in their behalf at the Court of\r\nFrance. Here Murray communicated with Cardinal Tencin, the successor of\r\nCardinal Fleury, in the management of the affairs of the Chevalier, and\r\nhere he met the exiled Marquis of Tullibardine, who, notwithstanding his\r\nlosses and misfortunes in the year 1715, was still sanguine of ultimate\r\nsuccess. Here, too, was the unfortunate Charles Radcliffe, who, with\r\nothers once opulent, once independent, were now forced to submit to\r\nreceive, with many indignities in the payment, pensions from the French\r\nGovernment. It was easy to inflame the minds of persons so situated with\r\nfalse hopes; and Murray is said to have been indefatigable in the\r\nprosecution of his scheme. After a delay of three weeks in Paris, he set\r\noff on that memorable undertaking to engage the Clans, which ultimately\r\nended in the insurrection of 1745.\r\n\r\nLord George Murray, meantime, had returned to his native country, where\r\nhe was presented to George the Second, and solicited, but ineffectually,\r\na commission in the British army. This was refused, and the ardour in\r\nthe Stuart cause, which we may presume to have wavered, again revived in\r\nits original vigour.\r\n\r\nPrevious to the Insurrection of 1745, Lord George Murray married Amelia,\r\nthe only surviving child and heiress of James Murray of Glencarse and\r\nStrowan, a lady who appears, both from the terms of affection and\r\nrespect expressed towards her by the Marquis of Tullibardine, and from\r\nthe tenour of her own letters, to have coincided warmly in the efforts\r\nof her husband for the restoration of the Stuarts.[12] Five children\r\nwere the issue of this marriage.\r\n\r\nThe course which public affairs were now taking checked, however,\r\ncompletely all hopes of domestic felicity. After several unsuccessful\r\nnegotiations in Paris attempted by the agents of James Stuart, and in\r\nLondon by Lord Elcho, the scheme of invasion languished for some time.\r\nWhilst all was apparently secure, however, the metropolis was the scene\r\nof secret cabals and meetings of the Jacobites, sometimes at one place,\r\nsometimes at another; but unhappily for their cause, the party generally\r\nwanted compactness and discretion. \"The little Jacobites,\" as those who\r\nwere not in the secret of these manoeuvres were called, began to\r\nflatter themselves that a large army would land in England from France\r\nthat summer. Nor was it the policy of Government to check these reports,\r\nwhich strengthened the hands of the ministry, and procured a grant of\r\nthe supplies with alacrity. The Jacobites, meantime, ran from house to\r\nhouse, intoxicated with their anticipated triumphs; and such chance of\r\nsuccess as there might be was thus rendered abortive.\r\n\r\nThe year 1743 ended, however; and the visions of the Jacobites vanished\r\ninto air. Donald Cameron of Lochiel, the elder, who visited Paris for\r\nthe purpose of ascertaining what were the real intentions of the French\r\ncabinet, found that even the Cardinal Tencin did not think it yet time\r\nfor the attempt, and he returned to Scotland disheartened. The death of\r\nthe Cardinal Fleury in 1743 added to the discomfiture of his hopes.[13]\r\nAbove all, the reluctance of the English Jacobites to pledge themselves\r\nto the same assurances that had been given by the Scotch, and their\r\nshyness in conversing with the people who were sent from France or\r\nScotland on the subject, perplexed the emissaries who arrived in this\r\ncountry, and offered but a faint hope of their assistance from England.\r\n\r\nBut, in the ensuing year, the affairs of the Jacobites brightened;\r\nFrance, which had suspended her favours, once more encouraged and\r\nflattered the party. A messenger was dispatched to the palace of Albano,\r\nto acquaint the Chevalier that the day was now arrived when his views\r\nmight be expected to prosper; whilst at the same time the utmost pains\r\nwere taken by the French Government to appear to the English averse to\r\nthe pretensions of James Stuart. It affords, indeed, another trait of\r\nthe unfortunate tendency of the Stuart family to repose a misplaced\r\nconfidence, that they should have relied on professions so hollow and so\r\nvague as those of France. But the dependent and desolate situation of\r\nthat Prince may well be supposed to have blinded a judgment not ripened\r\nby any active participation in the general business of life, and\r\nnarrowed within his little Court. Besides, there remained some who,\r\nafter the conflict at Culloden was over, could even view the enterprise\r\nas having been by no means unauspicious. \"Upon the whole,\" writes\r\nMaxwell of Kirkconnel, \"the conjuncture seemed favourable; and it is not\r\nto be wondered that a young Prince, naturally brave, should readily lay\r\nhold of it. There was a prospect of recalling his father from an exile\r\nnearly as long as his life, saving his country from impending ruin, and\r\nrestoring both to the enjoyment of their rights.\"[14]\r\n\r\nGreat preparations were in fact actually made by the French Government\r\nfor the invasion of Great Britain. The young Prince, who was forthwith\r\nsummoned from Rome, was to land in the Highlands and head the Clans;\r\nLord John Drummond, it was arranged, should make a descent on the\r\nsouthern part of the island, and endeavour to join the young Chevalier,\r\nand march towards Edinburgh. Twelve thousand French were to pour into\r\nWales at the same time, under the command of a general who was never\r\nnamed, and to join such English insurgents as should rally to their\r\nassistance.\r\n\r\nThis scheme, had it been executed with promptness, might perhaps have\r\nprospered better than, in these later times, in the security of an\r\nundisturbed succession, we are inclined to allow. General discontents\r\nprevailed in England. The partiality which had been shown to the\r\nHanoverian troops in preference to the English at the battle of\r\nDettingen had irritated, if not alienated, the affections of the army.\r\nThe King and the Duke of Cumberland were abroad, and a small number of\r\nships only guarded the coast. Parliament was not sitting; and most of\r\nthe members both of the Lords and Commons, and of the Privy Council,\r\nwere at their country-seats. But the proper moment for the enterprise\r\nwas lost by delays, and the same opportunity never again occurred.\r\n\r\nMeantime, the young Prince who was to influence the destiny of so many\r\nbrave men, accompanied by his brother, left Rome furtively, under\r\npretext of going to hunt at Cisterna. A tender affection, cemented by\r\ntheir adversities, existed between James Stuart and his sons. As they\r\nparted from each other with tears and embracings, the gallant Charles\r\nEdward exclaimed, \"I go to claim your right to three crowns: If I fail,\"\r\nhe added earnestly, \"your next sight of me, sir, shall be in my coffin!\"\r\n\"My son,\" exclaimed the Chevalier, \"Heaven forbid that all the crowns in\r\nthe world should rob me of my child!\"[15] Mr. Murray of Broughton was\r\npresent at this interview; the prelude to disasters and dangers to the\r\nardent young man, and of anxieties and disappointments to his father,\r\nfeelingly depicted in the Chevalier's touching letters to his\r\nchildren.[16]\r\n\r\nBy a stratagem the young Prince effected his journey from Rome without\r\nits becoming known, and eleven days after his departure from that city\r\nelapsed before it was made public. He was accompanied by Henry Benedict,\r\nwho was at this time a youth of great promise. He is described as having\r\nhad, as well as his brother, a very fine person, though somewhat shorter\r\nin stature than that ill-fated young man, and of a less delicate\r\ncomplexion. He seems to have been, perhaps, better constituted for the\r\ncareer of difficulty which Charles Edward encountered. He was of a\r\nrobust form, with an unusual fire in his eyes. Whilst his brother united\r\nthe different qualities of the Stuart and the Sobieski, Henry Benedict\r\nis said to have been more entirely actuated by the spirit of his great\r\nancestor, King John of Poland; by whom, and the handful of Christians\r\nwhom he headed, a hundred and fifty thousand Turks were defeated. Even\r\nwhen only nine years of age, the high-spirited boy, whose martial\r\nqualities were afterwards subdued beneath the taming influence of a\r\nCardinal's hat, resented the refusal of his father to allow him to\r\naccompany his brother to assist the young King of Naples in the recovery\r\nof his dominions; and could only be pacified by the threat of having his\r\ngarter, the beloved insignia of English knighthood, taken from him as\r\nwell as his sword.[17][18]\r\n\r\nIt soon became evident that the designs of France were not unknown at\r\nSt. James's. The celebrated Chauvelin, Secretary of State to Louis the\r\nFifteenth, had long been employing his influence over the Cardinal\r\nFleury to counteract the wishes of the English. By a slight accident his\r\ndesigns were disclosed to Queen Caroline. Chauvelin had,\r\nunintentionally, among other papers, put into the hands of the Earl of\r\nWaldegrave, then ambassador in France, a letter from the Chevalier. Lord\r\nWaldegrave immediately sent it to Queen Caroline. This involved a long\r\ncorrespondence between Sir Robert Walpole and Waldegrave on the subject.\r\n\"Jacobitism,\" to borrow the language of Dr. Cox, \"at this time produced\r\na tremor through every nerve of Government; and the slightest incident\r\nthat discovered any intercourse between the Pretender and France\r\noccasioned the most serious apprehensions.\"[19] The spirit of\r\ninsurrection and discontent had long pervaded not only the capital,\r\nwhich was disturbed by frequent tumults, but the country; and the murder\r\nof Porteous in Edinburgh, in 1736, was proved only to be the result of a\r\nregular systematic plan of resistance to the Government.[20]\r\n\r\nThe death of Queen Caroline deprived the oppressed Jacobites in both\r\nkingdoms of their only friend at Court. The unfortunate of all modes of\r\nfaith met, indeed, with protection and beneficence from that excellent\r\nPrincess. Those Roman Catholics, whose zeal for the Stuart cause had\r\nexposed them to the rigour of the law, were succoured by her bounty;\r\nlarge sums were sent by her to the indigent and ruined Jacobite\r\nfamilies; and Sir Robert Walpole, who was greatly disturbed at this show\r\nof mercy to the delinquent party, truly exclaimed, \"that the Jacobites\r\nhad a ready access to the Queen by the backstairs, and that all attempts\r\nto suppress them would be ineffectual.\"[21]\r\n\r\nThe last efforts of Walpole, then Lord Orford, were exerted to warn the\r\ncountry of the danger to be feared in that second invasion, for\r\nprognosticating which he had so often been severely ridiculed. He\r\nalluded to \"the greatest power in Europe, which was setting up a\r\nPretender to the throne; the winds alone having hindered an invasion and\r\nprotected Britain.\" He warned the Lords, that the rebellion which he\r\nanticipated would be \"fought on British ground.\" The memorable oration\r\nin which he unfolded these sentiments, which were delivered with great\r\nemotion, touched the heart of Frederic Prince of Wales; who arose,\r\nquitted his seat, and, taking Lord Orford by the hand, expressed his\r\nacknowledgments.[22] That warning was the last effort of one sinking\r\nunder an excruciating disease, and to whose memory the tragedy of 1715\r\nmust still have been present.\r\n\r\nCharles Edward, to whose ill-omened attempts to sail from Dunkirk,\r\nWalpole had thus alluded, had borne that disastrous endeavour with a\r\nfortitude which augured well for his future powers of endurance. Mr.\r\nMaxwell[23] thus describes his commencement of the voyage. \"Most of the\r\ntroops,\" he says, \"were already embarked, when a furious storm dispersed\r\nthe ships of war, and drove the transports on the coast: the troops\r\nalready embarked were glad to gain the shore, having lost some of their\r\nnumber. It is hardly possible to conceive a greater disappointment than\r\nthat which the Prince met with on this occasion. How severely soever he\r\nmight feel it, he did not seem dejected; on the contrary, he was in\r\nappearance cheerful and easy; encouraged such of his friends as seemed\r\nmost deeply affected, telling them Providence would furnish him with\r\nother occasions of delivering his father's subjects, and making them\r\nhappy. Immediately after this disaster the expedition was given up, and\r\nthe Prince returned to Paris, where he lived incognito till he set out\r\nfor Scotland. Not long after his return to Paris, war was declared\r\nbetwixt France and England, which gave him fresh hopes that something\r\nwould be undertaken. But after several months, seeing no appearance, he\r\ngrew very impatient, and began to think of trying his fortune with such\r\nfriends as would follow him: he was sick of the obscure way he was in;\r\nhe thought himself neglected by the court of France, but could not bear\r\nthe thoughts of returning to Rome. He had heard much of the loyalty and\r\nbravery of the Scotch Highlanders; but the number of those Clans he\r\ncould depend upon was too inconsiderable to do anything effectual. While\r\nhe was thus perplexed and fluctuating, John Murray of Broughton arrived\r\nfrom Scotland.\"\r\n\r\nIn this emergency, the flattering representations of Murray of\r\nBroughton found a ready response in the young Prince's heart.\r\nNotwithstanding the assertions of that individual in his evidence at\r\nLovat's trial, that he had used every means to dissuade the Prince from\r\ngoing to Scotland,[24] it is expressly stated by Mr. Maxwell,[25] that\r\nhe \"advised the Prince, in his own name, to come to Scotland at any\r\nrate; it was his opinion that the Prince should come as well provided\r\nand attended as possible, but rather come alone than delay coming; that\r\nthose who had invited the Prince, and promised to join him if he came at\r\nthe head of four or five thousand regular troops, would do the same if\r\nhe came without any troops at all; in fine, that he had a very strong\r\nparty in Scotland, and would have a very good chance of succeeding. This\r\nwas more than enough to determine the Prince. The expedition was\r\nresolved upon, and Murray despatched to Scotland with such orders and\r\ninstructions as were thought proper at that juncture.\"\r\n\r\nMr. Murray may therefore be considered as in a great measure responsible\r\nfor the event of that proceeding, which he afterwards denounced as a\r\n\"desperate undertaking.\" He found, unhappily, ready instruments in the\r\nunfortunate Marquis of Tullibardine, in Mr. Radcliffe, and others, whose\r\nfate he may thus be considered to have hastened by his alluring\r\nrepresentations of the prospects of success.\r\n\r\nWhen it was decided that Charles Edward should throw himself on the\r\nloyalty of the Clans, and intimation was given of the whole scheme, Lord\r\nGeorge Murray prepared for action. The landing of the Prince, the\r\nerection of a standard at Glenfinnin, the march through Lochiel, and the\r\nencampment between Glengarry and Fort Augustus, were events which he did\r\nnot personally aid by his presence. He was, indeed, busily employed in\r\nassembling his father's tenantry; and it was not until the Prince\r\narrived at Perth that Lord George Murray was presented to him; he was\r\nalmost immediately created a Lieutenant-General in the Prince's service.\r\nHis power in the Highlands was, indeed, of a far greater extent than\r\nthat military rank would seem to imply; for, although the Marquis of\r\nTullibardine was the nominal commander in the North, to Lord George\r\nMurray was entrusted the actual management of affairs; an arrangement\r\nwith which the modest and conscientious Tullibardine willingly complied.\r\n\r\nThe character of Lord George might be considered as partly sobered by\r\ntime; since, at the commencement of the Rebellion of 1745, he was forty\r\nyears of age. He was in the full vigour, therefore, of his great natural\r\nand intellectual powers, which, when at that period of life they have\r\nbeen ripened by exercise and experience, are perhaps at their zenith.\r\nThe person of Lord George was tall and robust; he had the self-denial\r\nand energy of his countrymen. He slept little, and entered into every\r\ndescription of detail; he was persevering in everything which he\r\nundertook; he was vigilant, active, and diligent. To these qualities he\r\nunited a natural genius for military operations; and his powers were\r\nsuch, that it was justly thought, that, had he been well instructed in\r\nmilitary tactics, he would have formed one of the ablest generals of\r\nthe day. As it was, the retreat from Derby, ill-advised as it may be\r\ndeemed, is said to have sufficiently manifested his skill as a\r\ncommander.\r\n\r\nIn addition to these attributes, Lord George was brave to the highest\r\ndegree; and, in all engagements, was always the first to rush sword in\r\nhand into danger. As he advanced to the charge, and looked round upon\r\nthe Highlanders, whose character he well understood, it was his practice\r\nto say, \"I do not ask you, my lads, to go before; but only to follow\r\nme.\"[26] It cannot be a matter of surprise, that, with this bold and\r\nresolute spirit, Lord George was the darling of the Highland soldiers;\r\nand that his strong influence over their minds should have enabled him\r\nto obviate, in some measure, the deficiencies of discipline. \"Taking\r\nthem,\" as a contemporary writer asserts, \"merely as they came from the\r\nplough, he made them perform prodigies of valour against English armies,\r\nalways greatly superior in number to that of the Prince Charles Edward,\r\nalthough the English troops are allowed to be the best in Europe.\" Thus\r\nendowed, Lord George Murray showed how feeble are the advantages of\r\nbirth, compared with those of nature's gift. In rank, if not in family\r\nconnections, and in an hereditary hold upon the affections of his\r\ncountrymen, the Duke of Perth might be esteemed superior; but, brave and\r\nhonourable as he was, that amiable nobleman could never obtain the\r\nconfidence of the army as a general. It is not, however, to be supposed\r\nthat any commander would ever have obtained an influence over a\r\nHighland army, if he had not added high birth to his other requisites.\r\nThe Clansmen were especially aristocratic in their notions; and the\r\nnames which they had honoured and loved from their birth, were alone\r\nthose to which they would eagerly respond.\r\n\r\nTo counterbalance the fine, soldierly characteristics which graced the\r\nlofty and heroic Lord George Murray, some defects, of too stern a nature\r\nto be called weaknesses, but yet indicative of narrowness of mind,\r\nclouded his excellent qualities. Unlike most great men, he was not open\r\nto conviction. That noble candour, which can bear counsels, or receive\r\neven admonition with gratitude, was not a part of his haughty nature. A\r\nsense of superiority over every human being rendered him impatient of\r\nthe slightest controul, and greedy of exclusive power. He was imperious\r\nand determined; and was deficient in the courtesy which forms, combined\r\nwith honesty, so fine an attribute in a soldier's bearing. \"He wanted,\"\r\nsays one who knew him well, \"the sole ordering of everything.\"[27]\r\n\r\nAt Perth, Lord George Murray met with the famous Chevalier Johnstone,\r\nwhom he soon adopted into his service. This young soldier, whose pen has\r\nsupplied memoirs of the Rebellion of 1745, and upon whose statements\r\nmuch of the reported merits of Lord George Murray rests, was the only\r\nson of a merchant in Edinburgh, and the descendant of an ancient and\r\nwell-connected family. By the marriage of his sister he was nearly\r\nrelated to the House of Rollo; and, from these and other circumstances,\r\nhe mingled with the best society in his native city.\r\n\r\nHaving been educated in Jacobite and Episcopalian principles, young\r\nJohnstone hailed with delight the arrival of Prince Charles: he resolved\r\ninstantly to join his standard. Escaping from Edinburgh, he hastened to\r\nDuncrub, the seat of Lord Rollo, near Perth. Here he awaited the arrival\r\nof the young Chevalier; and here he was introduced by his cousins, the\r\ndaughters of Lord Rollo, to the Duke of Perth and to Lord George Murray.\r\nThe Chevalier Johnstone was one of the first Low-countrymen that joined\r\nthe standard of Charles Edward.\r\n\r\nLord George Murray very soon discovered that the requisites for forming\r\na good soldier and an active partizan were centred in young Johnstone.\r\nFor the former he was qualified by an open and impetuous character,\r\ngenerally combined with a desperate courage. The jollity and licence of\r\nthe Cavalier school, which characterized Johnstone, did not materially\r\ndetract from, but added rather to the popularity of his character. As a\r\npartizan, he has proved his zeal by his Memoirs, which afford a sample\r\nof much heat and prejudice, and which have, in upholding Lord George\r\nMurray, done an injury to the memory of Charles Edward, of which the\r\nadversaries of his cause have not failed to take advantage. To many\r\nerrors of character, and to some egotism, the Chevalier Johnstone, as he\r\ncame to be called in after-life, united a kind heart and an enthusiastic\r\ndisposition. He acted for a considerable time as aide-de-camp to Lord\r\nGeorge Murray, and afterwards in the same capacity with the Prince. But\r\nhis liveliest admiration appears to have been directed towards the\r\ngeneral who has been classed with Montrose and Dundee,[28] and no\r\nsubsequent service under other masters ever effaced his impression of\r\nrespect and confidence to Lord George Murray. After the battle of\r\nPreston-Pans Johnstone received a captain's commission from the Prince:\r\nand, exhausted with his duties as aide-de-camp, he formed a company,\r\nwith which he joined the Duke of Perth's regiment. His history, mingled\r\nup as it is with that of the General under whom he first served, must\r\nnecessarily be incorporated with the following narrative.\r\n\r\nLord George Murray continued, for some time, busily engaged in rallying\r\naround him his brother's vassals. The Duke of Atholl is partly\r\nproprietor, partly superior, of the country which bears his name. That\r\nregion is inhabited by Stuarts and Robinsons, none of the Duke's name\r\nliving upon his estates. Of these, several have fiefs or mortgages of\r\nthe Atholl family, and command the common people of their respective\r\nClans; but, like other Highlanders, they believe that they are bound to\r\nrise in arms when the chief of their whole Clan requires it. The vassals\r\non the Atholl territory were well-affected to the Stuarts, great pains\r\nhaving been taken by the father of Lord George Murray, notwithstanding\r\nhis efforts to appear loyal to the Government, to infuse the spirit of\r\nJacobitism among them.[29]\r\n\r\nOf the events which succeeded his joining the Prince's standard at\r\nPerth, until the commencement of the retreat from Derby, Lord George\r\nMurray has left a succinct relation. It is written, as are his letters,\r\nin a plain, free, manly style, which dispels all doubt as to the\r\nsincerity of the narrator.\r\n\r\n\"I joined the standard at Perth,\"[30] he begins, \"the day his Royal\r\nHighness arrived there. As I had formerly known something of a Highland\r\narmy, the first thing I did was to advise the Prince to endeavour to get\r\nproper people for provisors and commissaries, for otherwise there would\r\nbe no keeping the men together, and they would straggle through the\r\nwhole country upon their marches if it was left to themselves to find\r\nprovisions; which, beside the inconveniency of irregular marches, and\r\nmuch time lost, great abuses would be committed, which, above all\r\nthings, we were to avoid. I got many of the men to make small knapsacks\r\nof sacking before we left Perth, to carry a peck of meal each upon\r\noccasion; and I caused take as many threepenny loaves there as would be\r\nthree days' bread to our small army, which was carried in carts. I sent\r\nabout a thousand of these knapsacks to Crieff, to meet the men who were\r\ncoming from Atholl.\"\r\n\r\nThe difficulties which Lord George encountered were, it is evident,\r\nconsiderable. Upon the arrival of Charles Edward at Perth, his army\r\namounted only to two thousand men,[31] until he was joined by Lord\r\nGeorge Murray, by the Duke of Perth, and by Lord Nairn, and other\r\npersons of distinction.[32] There were few persons in that army who were\r\ncapable, by being versed in military affairs, of giving Lord George\r\nMurray any advice or assistance. The Highland chiefs possessed the most\r\nheroic courage; but they knew no other manoeuvre but that of rushing,\r\nsword in hand, upon an enemy. The Irish officers were equally deficient\r\nin experience and knowledge; and, with the exception of Mr. Sullivan,\r\nare stated \"to have had no more knowledge than the whole stock of\r\nsubalterns, namely, the knowing how to mount and quit guard.\" Such is\r\nthe description given of the collected forces by Johnstone. But,\r\nalthough not trained as regular soldiers, and accustomed chiefly to the\r\ncare of herds of black cattle, whom they wandered after in the\r\nmountains, the Highlanders had a discipline of their own. Their chiefs\r\nusually kept about them several retainers experienced in the use of\r\narms; and a meeting of two or three gentlemen was sure to bring together\r\na little army, for the habits of the clansmen were essentially military.\r\nIt was, some considered, a circumstance favourable to Lord George\r\nMurray, that, being unprepared by an early military education, he was\r\nunfettered by its formal rules, and therefore was more calculated to\r\nlead an undisciplined army of Highlanders, whose native energies he knew\r\nhow to direct better than a skilful tactician would have ventured to\r\ndo.[33] During his stay at Perth, the Highlanders, so prone to\r\nirregularities when not in active service, were tranquil under the\r\nstrictest military rule.[34]\r\n\r\nIt was here, however, that the first seeds of dissension were sown\r\nbetween Charles Edward and Lord George. Sir Thomas Sheridan, the tutor\r\nof the Prince, who was allowed to \"have lived and died a man of honour,\"\r\nbut who was manifestly incapable of the great charge intrusted to him,\r\nboth in the education of the young Princes and as their adviser in\r\nafter-life, added to his other deficiencies a total ignorance of the\r\nBritish constitution and habits of thinking. The Prince, of course, was\r\nequally ill-informed. They were therefore in the practice, in\r\nconversation, of espousing sentiments of arbitrary power, which were\r\nequally impolitic and unbecoming. Sincere and shrewd, Lord George Murray\r\nlost no time in expressing to Charles Edward his decided disapproval of\r\nthis tone of discourse. His motives in these expostulations were\r\nexcellent, but his overbearing manner nullified all the good that might\r\nhave been effected. He offended the Prince, who repressed indeed his\r\nsecret indignation, but whose pride, fostered by circumstances, could\r\nill brook the assumption of his General.[35]\r\n\r\nIt was not until the Prince reached Edinburgh that a regular Council was\r\nformed; consisting of the Duke of Perth, Lord George Murray, Lord Elcho,\r\nSecretary Murray, Sir Thomas Sheridan, and Mr. Sullivan, the Highland\r\nchiefs, and afterwards of all the colonels in the army. But, among the\r\nadvisers of the Prince, an \"ill-timed emulation,\" as Mr. Maxwell calls\r\nit, now crept in, and bred great dissension and animosities. \"The\r\ndissensions,\" he states, \"began at Edinburgh:\" according to Sir Walter\r\nScott, they had an earlier origin, and originated at Perth.\r\n\r\nThey were aggravated, as in the Council at Perth in the time of Lord\r\nMar, by the base passions of an individual. Detesting the weak and\r\ncrooked policy of Mar and viewing from his calm position as an inferior\r\nactor, with a fiendish pleasure, the embarrassments and mistakes of him\r\nwhom he hated, stood the Master of Sinclair. Blinded by a selfish\r\njealousy of power over the mind of him whom he afterwards betrayed to\r\nthe ruin which he was working, and \"aiming at nothing less than the sole\r\ndirection and management of everything, the Secretary Murray sacrificed\r\nto this evil passion, this thirst for ascendancy, all the hopes of\r\nprosperity to Charles Edward--all present peace to the harassed and\r\nperplexed young man whom his counsels had brought to Scotland. It was\r\nhe,\" strongly, and perhaps bitterly, writes Mr. Maxwell, \"that had\r\nengaged the Prince to make this attempt upon so slight a foundation, and\r\nthe wonderful success that had hitherto attended it was placed to his\r\naccount.\"\r\n\r\nBy some the sincerity of Murray's loyalty and good-faith were even\r\ncredited. The Duke of Perth, among a few others, judged of Murray's\r\nheart by his own, went readily into all his schemes, and confirmed the\r\nPrince in the opinion which he had imbibed of his favourite. After Kelly\r\nhad left the Prince, Murray contrived to gain over Sullivan and Sir\r\nThomas Sheridan, and by that means effectually governed Charles Edward.\r\nThe fearless, lofty, honest character of Lord George Murray alone\r\noffered an obstacle to the efforts of the Secretary to obtain, for his\r\nown purposes, an entire controul; he cherished towards the General that\r\naversion which a mean and servile nature ever feels to one whose\r\ndealings are free from fraud or deceit. He also feared him as a rival,\r\nand it became his aim to undermine him, and to lay a plot for the chief\r\nstay and prop of the undertaking. It was naturally to be supposed that\r\nLord George Murray's age, his high birth, his experience and influence,\r\nand his great capacity, would have given him an advantage over his\r\ndastardly rival, and have gained the first consideration with the\r\nPrince. But Murray of Broughton, unhappily, had acquired an early\r\ninfluence over the credulous mind of the young adventurer. His\r\nacquaintance beneath the roof of the Santi Apostoli had secured an\r\nunhappy confidence in his fidelity and worth. He shortly took advantage\r\nof the sentiments which ought to have ensured the nicest honour, the\r\nmost scrupulous truth, in return, to deceive and to mislead his young\r\nmaster.[36]\r\n\r\nUnfortunately there was one point upon which the honour of Lord George\r\nMurray was to be suspected. He \"_was said_\" to have solicited a\r\ncommission in the English army.[37] Upon this supposed early defection\r\nof Lord George to the Hanoverian party, Murray grounded his accusations.\r\n\r\n\"He began by representing Lord George as a traitor to the Prince; he\r\nassured him that he had joined on purpose to have an opportunity of\r\ndelivering him up to Government. It was hardly possible to guard against\r\nthis imposture. The Prince had the highest opinion of his Secretary's\r\nintegrity, and knew little of Lord George Murray. So the calumny had its\r\nfull effect. Lord George soon came to know the suspicion the Prince had\r\nof him, and was affected, as one may easily imagine; to be sure, nothing\r\ncould be more shocking to a man of honour, and one that was now for the\r\nthird time venturing his life and fortune for the royal cause. The\r\nPrince was partly undeceived by Lord George's gallant behaviour at the\r\nbattle; and, had Lord George improved that opportunity, he might perhaps\r\nhave gained the Prince's favour, and get the better of the Secretary:\r\nbut his haughty and overbearing manner prevented a thorough\r\nreconciliation, and seconded the malicious insinuations of his rival.\"\r\n\r\nAnother anecdote is related, on the authority of Murray of Broughton: On\r\nthe tenth of October the Chevalier issued a manifesto, dated from\r\nHolyrood House. This document is acknowledged, even by the opposite\r\nparty, to have been remarkably well written:[38] but it was not\r\ncompleted without some heart-burnings, arising from the distrust of many\r\nmembers of the Kirk, who conceived that it did not contain assurances\r\nfor the security of their manner of Divine worship. A grand council was\r\ntherefore held, concerning the alterations which were necessary to\r\nconciliate the good opinion of the Presbyterians. Mr. Kelly, who had\r\ndrawn up the manifesto, was very tenacious of his performance; but the\r\nmajority of those who were present were of opinion that the manifesto\r\nwould prosper better if a promise of putting the penal laws against\r\nPapists into effect were added to it. Upon this proposition the young\r\nChevalier was observed to change countenance, doubtless reflecting that\r\nit would be ungrateful to depress those who had been such real friends\r\nto his father. He had, however, the prudence to say but little, and to\r\nmaintain a neutral position during the debate, which was carried on with\r\nmuch bitterness on both sides of the question. It is remarkable that the\r\nDuke of Perth, Sullivan, and O'Neil, who were all Papists, voted for the\r\naddition; whilst many who were of the Reformed Church opposed it.\r\nAmongst these was Lord George Murray, who, starting up and turning to\r\nCharles Edward, exclaimed, with an oath, \"Sir, if you permit this\r\narticle to be inserted, you will lose five hundred thousand friends;\"\r\nmeaning that there were that number of Papists in England. On this, the\r\nPrince arose from his chair and withdrew, offended, as it was thought,\r\nby the vehemence and overbearing advice of Lord George. As he left the\r\nroom, he said, \"I will have it decided by a majority.\" But the freedom\r\nwith which he had been treated appears to have rankled in his mind. The\r\nadditional clause was negatived, and the manifesto remained in the same\r\nstate as when it came from Mr. Kelly's hands.[39]\r\n\r\nThere were, indeed, times when Lord George endeavoured to retrieve\r\nmistakes of which he was conscious, and upon some occasions he subdued\r\nhis lofty temper so far as to be \"very obsequious and respectful, but\r\nhad not temper to go through with it.\" \"He now and then broke into such\r\nviolent sallies as the Prince could not digest, though the situation of\r\nhis affairs forced him to bear with them.[40] The Secretary's station\r\nand favour had attached to him such as were confident of success, and\r\nhad nothing in view but making their fortunes. Nevertheless, Lord George\r\nhad greater weight and influence in the Council, and generally brought\r\nthe majority over to his opinion; which so irritated the ambitious\r\nSecretary, that he endeavoured to give the Prince a bad impression of\r\nthe Council itself, and engaged to lay it entirely aside.\"\r\n\r\nIt was not only in regard to Lord George Murray that the influence of\r\nthe Secretary was prejudicial to the Prince's interests; neither was\r\nLord George the only person whom he dreaded as a rival. Having access to\r\nthe most intimate communication with Charles Edward, he abused the youth\r\nand inexperience of the ill-fated man to inspire him with a distrust of\r\nmany gentlemen of good family and of integrity, whose fidelity he\r\ncontrived to whisper away. All employments were filled up at the\r\nSecretary's nomination; and he contrived to bestow them upon his own\r\ncreatures, who would never thwart his measures. Hence it followed that\r\nplaces of trust were bestowed on \"insignificant little fellows,\" while\r\nthere were abundance of gentlemen of merit who might have been of great\r\nuse, had they met with the confidence of their Prince. \"Those that\r\nMurray had thus placed,\" continues Mr. Maxwell, \"seconded his dirty\r\nlittle views; and it was their interest, too, to keep their betters at a\r\ndistance from the Prince's person and acquaintance.\"\r\n\r\nUntil a very short time before Charles Edward left Perth, he appears to\r\nhave felt the most unqualified admiration for the Highland character,\r\nwhich he had carefully studied.[41] He thus expressed himself to his\r\nfather: \"I have occasion every day to reflect on your Majesty's last\r\nwords to me,--that I should find power, if tempered with justice and\r\nclemency, an easy thing to myself, and not grievous to those under me.\r\n'Tis owing to the observance of this rule, and to my conformity to the\r\ncustoms of these people, that I have got their hearts, to a degree not\r\neasy to be conceived by those who do not see it. One who observes the\r\ndiscipline which I have established, would take my little army to be a\r\nbody of picked veterans; and, to see the love and harmony that reigns\r\namongst us, he would be apt to look upon it as a large well-ordered\r\nfamily, in which every one loves another better than himself.\"\r\n\r\nHe even applauded the rude climate of Scotland. \"I keep my health better\r\nin these wild mountains than I used to do in the Campagna Felice; and\r\nsleep sounder, lying on the ground, than I used to do in the palaces at\r\nRome.\"\r\n\r\nIn this happy temper the Prince set out on his march from Perth to\r\nEdinburgh. The march was made in the most perfect good order, and the\r\nstrictest discipline prevented any depredations. As the insurgent army\r\npassed by Stirling, the standard of the Chevalier was saluted by some\r\nshot from the castle. Nevertheless, Lord George Murray sent into the\r\ntown, and the gates were opened; and bread, cheese, and butter sent out\r\nto sell, near to Bannockburn, where the army halted. On the seventeenth\r\nof September the city of Edinburgh was taken.\r\n\r\nIn the description of the courtly scenes of Holyrood, it does not appear\r\nthat Lord George Murray took any conspicuous part. His sphere was the\r\ncouncil-room, or the camp, or the battle-field; and of his proceedings\r\nin these different occupations he has left a very particular account,\r\nwritten with the same manly spirit and fearless tone which he displayed\r\nin ordinary life.\r\n\r\nWhen the Prince's Council had received accounts of Sir John Cope's\r\nlanding at Dunbar, they left Edinburgh and lay upon their arms at\r\nDuddingstone, and on the twentieth marched to meet the enemy. Lord\r\nGeorge commanded the van, and, whilst passing the south side of Pinkie\r\nGardens, he heard that Cope was at or near Preston, and that he would\r\nprobably gain the high ground at Fawside. There was no time to\r\ndeliberate or to wait for orders. Well acquainted with the ground, Lord\r\nGeorge struck off through the fields, without keeping to any road. He\r\nwent without being even preceded by the usual escort to choose the\r\nground where to halt. In less than half an hour, by marching quickly, he\r\ngained the eminence; he slackened his pace and waited for the rear,\r\nstill proceeding slowly towards Tranent, always fronting the enemy.\r\nGeneral Cope's army was drawn up on the plain between Preston Grange\r\nand Tranent, with deep broad ditches between them. After much\r\nreconnoitring and some firing, on the part of the enemy, from these\r\nditches, at the Highlanders, who they thought had never seen cannon, and\r\nwould therefore be intimidated, the English army was drawn up on the\r\neast side of the village of Tranent, where, on a dry stubble-field, with\r\na small rising in front to shelter them, they lay down to repose in rank\r\nand file.\r\n\r\n\"It was now night,\" writes Lord George Murray;[42] \"and when all the\r\nprincipal officers were called together, I proposed the attacking the\r\nenemy at break of day. I assured them that it was not only practicable,\r\nbut that it would, in all probability, be attended with success. I told\r\nthem I knew the ground myself, and had a gentleman or two with me who\r\nknew every part thereabouts: there was indeed a small defile at the east\r\nend of the ditches, but, once that was past, there would be no stop; and\r\nthough we should be long on our march, yet, when the whole line was past\r\nthe defile, they had nothing to do but to face to the left, and in a\r\nmoment the whole was formed, and then to attack. The Prince was highly\r\npleased with the proposal, as indeed the whole officers were; so, after\r\nplacing a few pickets, everybody lay down at their posts; and supped\r\nupon what they had with them. At midnight the principal officers were\r\ncalled again, and all was ordered as was at first proposed. Word was\r\nsent to the Atholl brigade to come off their post at two in the morning,\r\nand not to make the least noise.\"\r\n\r\nBefore four in the morning the army began to march, and an arrangement\r\nof the first line, which had been previously agreed upon, was now put\r\ninto execution. Those who had had the right the day before, were to have\r\nthe rear and the left; and this alteration was made without the least\r\nnoise or confusion. The Duke of Perth therefore went into the front,\r\nLord George giving up his guides to him. No horse marched at that time,\r\nfor fear of being discovered. When the army had advanced within a\r\nhundred paces of the ditches, they marched on to the attack, Lord George\r\ncalling on Cameron of Lochiel to incline to the left. As the enemy\r\ndiscovered their approach, the noise of the cannon announced that the\r\nengagement had begun. Notwithstanding that Lord George Murray's regiment\r\nwas the last to pass the defile towards the enemy, it was the first to\r\nfire. \"Our whole first line,\" writes the gallant soldier, \"broke through\r\nthe enemy. Some of them were rallying behind us; but when they saw our\r\nsecond line coming up, they then made the best of their way.\"\r\n\r\nLord George pursued the enemy to the walls of Bankton House, the\r\nresidence of Colonel Gardiner; and here a party of the enemy got over\r\nthe ditch, and fired at the Highland foe. This little company, brave as\r\nit was, was composed of only fourteen men, headed by a Lieutenant-Colonel.\r\n\"I got before a hundred of our men,\" writes Lord George, \"who had their\r\nguns presented to fire upon them, and at my desire they kept up their\r\nfire, so that those officers and soldiers surrendered themselves\r\nprisoners; and nothing gave me more pleasure that day than having it in\r\nmy power to save those men, as well as several others.\" This declaration\r\nwas perhaps necessary, to rescue the memory of Lord George from the\r\nopprobrium of cruelty; since it has been asserted, that at the battle of\r\nCulloden he issued orders to give no quarter, and that such a document\r\nto that effect, in the handwriting of Lord George, was in the possession\r\nof the Duke of Cumberland.[43] This stigma on the fame of Lord George\r\nMurray may have originated from the desperate character of that last\r\neffort: his haughty temper may have been exasperated in the course of\r\nthe fatal contest. It is a charge which can now only be repelled by the\r\nprevious character of the individual against whom it is made, since it\r\nwas never fairly made out, nor satisfactorily contradicted.\r\n\r\nAfter the action was partially over, Lord George Murray perceived that a\r\nnumber of people were gathered together on the height near to Tranent.\r\nMistaking them for the enemy, the General marched with his regiment,\r\naccompanied by Lochiel, who had kept his men together in good order,\r\nback to the narrow causeway that led up to Tranent. Here he found that\r\nthe supposed enemy were only country-people and servants. From them,\r\nhowever, he learned that the enemy were at Cokenny, only a mile and a\r\nhalf distant; and he instantly determined on pursuing them. His energy\r\nand valour in thus doing so, after the events of that harassing and\r\nexhausting day, cannot but be admired. He found on arriving at Cokenny,\r\na force of about three hundred Highlanders, a volunteer company recently\r\nembodied at Inverness by President Forbes. These soon surrendered;\r\nbetween sixteen and seventeen hundred prisoners were taken that day,\r\namong whom were seventy officers.[44] \"His Royal Highness,\" adds Lord\r\nGeorge Murray in giving this his personal narrative, \"took the same care\r\nof their wounded as of his own. I do not mention the behaviour of all\r\nour officers and men that day; their actions shewed it. I only take\r\nnotice of those two that were immediately under my eye, which was\r\nLochiel's regiment and the Stewarts of Appin.\" As the enemy's\r\nfoot-soldiers had made little or no resistance during the battle of\r\nPreston-Pans, they might have been all cut to pieces had it not been for\r\nthe interposition of Prince Charles and his officers, who gained that\r\nday as much honour by their humanity as by their bravery. The Prince,\r\nwhen the rout began, mounted his horse, galloped all over the field, and\r\nhis voice was heard amid that scene of horror, calling on his men to\r\nspare the lives of his enemies, \"whom he no longer looked upon as such.\"\r\nFar from being elated with the victory, which was considered as\r\ncomplete, the care of the kind-hearted and calumniated young man was\r\ndirected to assist the wounded. Owing to his exertions, eighty-three of\r\nthe officers were saved, besides hundreds of soldiers. \"The Prince,\"\r\nwrites Mr. Maxwell, \"had a livelier sense of other people's misfortunes\r\nthan of his own good-fortune.\"\r\n\r\nThis spirit of humanity was extended to the two Lieutenants-General. The\r\nconduct of the Duke of Perth was ever consistent with his mild\r\ncharacter. On that occasion, at all events, Lord George participated in\r\nthe noble clemency which usually characterized the Jacobites.\r\n\r\n\"In the evening,\" he writes,[45] \"I went with the officer prisoners to a\r\nhouse in Musselburgh that was allotted for them. Those who were worst\r\nwounded were left at Colonel Gardiner's house, where surgeons attended\r\nthem; the others walked, as I did, along with them without a guard (as\r\nthey had given me their parole); and to some, who were not able to walk,\r\nI gave my own horses. It was a new-finished house that was got for them,\r\nwhere there was neither table, bed, chair, nor chimney grate. I caused\r\nbuy some new-thrashed straw, and had by good-fortune as much cold\r\nprovisions and liquor of my own as made a tolerable meal to them all;\r\nand when I was going to retire, they entreated me not to leave them;\r\nfor, as they had no guard, they were afraid that some of the\r\nHighlanders, who had got liquor, might come in upon them and insult or\r\nplunder them.\"\r\n\r\nBeside these suffering men Lord George lay on a floor all night, having\r\ngiven up the minister's house in Musselburgh, which had been destined as\r\nhis quarters, to those who were valetudinary. On the following day those\r\nofficers who were tolerably well were removed to Pinkie House, where\r\nPrince Charles was staying. Lord George then returned to the field of\r\nbattle, to give directions about the cannon, and to see about the other\r\nwounded prisoners. He afterwards repaired to Pinkie House, the gardens\r\nof which were thronged that night with the prisoners, privates, to whom\r\nprovisions were sent; \"and the night before,\" as Lord George relates, \"I\r\ngot some of their own provisions carried from Cokenny to Colonel\r\nGardiner's courts and gardens for their use. In these things I ever\r\nlaid it down as a maxim, to do by others as I would wish they would do\r\nby me, had I been in their place, and they in mine.\" Such is the spirit\r\nin which the unfortunate were regarded by the victors of that day; and\r\nthese two accounts, that of Lord George Murray and that of Maxwell of\r\nKirkconnel, written without any mutual compact, and at different times,\r\nand even in different countries, disprove the following gross and\r\nimprobable statement of Henderson's of that which occurred after the day\r\nat Preston was fought and won.\r\n\r\nAccording to his account, professedly that of an eye-witness, the\r\nconduct of the young Chevalier (who, he acknowledges, had, by the advice\r\nof the Duke of Perth, sent to Edinburgh for surgeons,) was, in the\r\nhighest degree, unfeeling and indecent. He stood by the road-side, his\r\nhorse near him, \"with his armour of tin, which resembled a woman's\r\nstays, affixed to the saddle; he was on foot, clad as an ordinary\r\ncaptain, in a coarse plaid, and large blue bonnet, a scarlet waistcoat\r\nwith a narrow plain lace about it; his boots and knees were much dirtied\r\n(the effect of his having fallen into a ditch, as I afterwards\r\nunderstood); he was exceeding merry, and twice said, 'My Highlanders\r\nhave lost their plaids,' at which he laughed very heartily, being in no\r\nway affected when speaking of the dead or wounded. Nor would his jollity\r\nhave been interrupted, if he had not looked upon seven standards that\r\nhad been taken from the dragoons; on which he said, in French, (a\r\nlanguage he frequently spoke in,) 'We have missed some of them.' After\r\nthis, he refreshed himself upon the field, and, with the utmost\r\ncomposure, ate a piece of cold beef and drank a glass of wine, amidst\r\nthe deep and piercing groans of the poor men who had fallen victims to\r\nhis ambition.\"[46]\r\n\r\nAfter this flippant and hard-hearted conduct, as it is described, the\r\nPrince is said to have ridden off to Pinkie House, leaving the bulk of\r\nthe wounded on the field that day, to be brought in carts to Edinburgh.\r\n\"Few,\" he says, \"recovered; and those who did, went begging through the\r\nstreets, their heads tied about with bandages, but obtaining no relief\r\nfrom their conquerors. The property of the prisoners, the fine linen of\r\nthe officers, their gold and silver hilted swords, their watches and\r\nrings, were worn by the lowest among the soldiery almost before their\r\neyes.\"[47]\r\n\r\nThe battle of Preston, which was magnified by Lord Lovat as a \"glorious\r\nvictory not to be paralleled in history,\" although not meriting such\r\nextravagant remarks, produced the most important consequences to the\r\nJacobite cause. Among not the least important was the acquisition of all\r\nthe arms of the whole body of foot, and even of the volunteers. These\r\nwent to supply the recruits whom the Marquis of Tullibardine and others\r\nwere sending daily to the camp. No enemy was left in the field to oppose\r\nthe progress of Charles Edward's victorious troops.[48] When, having, as\r\nthe Chevalier Johnstone asserts, escaped from the field of battle by\r\nplacing a white cockade on his head, Cope arrived at Coldstream with\r\nhis troops in great disorder, he was greeted by Lord Mark Ker, one of a\r\nfamily who had long had hereditary claims to wit as well as courage,\r\nwith the bitter remark, that \"he believed he was the first general in\r\nEurope that had brought tidings of his own defeat.\"\r\n\r\n\"The Prince,\" writes Maxwell of Kirkconnel, \"was now, properly speaking,\r\nmaster of Scotland.\" The militia, which had been raised in some parts of\r\nScotland for the service of Government, was dismissed; and the\r\nChevalier's orders were obeyed in many places far from his army. These\r\nadvantages were, however, rather glaring than solid and permanent.\r\n\r\nAfter the battle of Preston, it became a serious and important question\r\nwhat step was to be taken. It was the Prince's earnest desire to push\r\nthe advantages thus gained by an immediate invasion of England, before\r\nthe Hanoverians had time to recover from their surprise. But this\r\nspirited and, as the event proved, sagacious opinion was objected to on\r\nthe score of the smallness of the forces, and the probability of an\r\naccession of strength before marching southwards. Lastly, the fatal hope\r\nof aid from France, that _ignis fatuus_ which had misled the Jacobite\r\nparty before, and on which it was their misfortune to depend, was\r\nadduced as an argument. The Prince yielded to his counsellors, and\r\nconsented to remain some time in Edinburgh. Upon this decision Lord\r\nGeorge Murray offers no opinion.\r\n\r\nThe castle of Edinburgh remained still unsubdued; and the Prince, upon\r\nhis return to that city, resolved on blockading the fortress. This was a\r\nvery unpopular step, but Charles had no alternative; since it was of\r\nvital importance to reduce a place of so great strength and consequence.\r\nAccordingly a proclamation was issued, forbidding, under pain of death,\r\nthat any provisions should be sent up to the castle; and the management\r\nof this blockade was entrusted to Lord George Murray.[49]\r\n\r\nThis able General now proposed to place guards in such a manner as\r\nshould prevent the garrison in the castle marching out to surprise him,\r\nbut his exertions were baffled by the want of judgment and incompetency\r\nof those beneath him in command. The guard was placed near the\r\nweigh-house at the foot of the Castle-rock, so that the battery of the\r\nhalf-moon, as it was termed, near the Castle-gate, bore upon it, and\r\nmany of the guard within would have perished upon the first firing. This\r\nwas not the only mistake. Mr. O'Sullivan, one of Prince Charles's\r\nofficers, one day placed a small guard near the West Kirk, which was not\r\nonly exposed to the enemy's fire, but conveniently situated near the\r\nsally-port, whence the besieged might issue and take the party there\r\nprisoners; for no relief could be sent to them in less than two hours'\r\ntime, owing to its being necessary to pass round the whole circumference\r\nof the castle to arrive at that point. \"I never,\" says Lord George\r\nMurray, \"knew of that guard's being placed there, until they were taken\r\nprisoners.\" So severe a service was this blockade, that it was found\r\nnecessary to relieve the guards, which were thus placed, by different\r\ncorps who could not know the risk which they encountered. Desertions\r\nfrom the Jacobite army were among the most formidable evils with which\r\nLord George had to contend. It was therefore important not to discourage\r\nthe soldiery. In the midst of difficulty the high-minded Cameron of\r\nLochiel came forward to offer his own person, and to risk his own\r\nregiment in this service. He agreed to take all the guards, and to\r\nrelieve them with the soldiers of his own regiment, who were quartered\r\nfor that purpose in the outer Parliament House. \"I was with him,\" writes\r\nLord George,[50] \"when the guards were relieved, and the men did their\r\nduty exceedingly, especially when there was danger; and, when the fire\r\nwas hottest from the castle, they kept their post with much resolution\r\nand bravery. Lochiel and I being much with them, gave them a heartiness\r\nthat hindered them from complaining of a duty which was so hard, and\r\nwhich the rest of the army had not in their turns. We even placed new\r\nguards to keep the castle from sallying, as they seemed disposed; and\r\nKeppoch's regiment was brought into town to take some of the guards and\r\nsupport them. I lay in town for some nights, and was constantly visiting\r\nthe guards and sentinels.\"\r\n\r\nThe castle, nevertheless, seated on the precipitous rocks, which, steep\r\nas they are, have yet been \"scaled by love and ambition,\"[51] defied the\r\nblockaders. The Highlanders continued to keep guard in the weigh-house,\r\nand, stationing themselves in the Grass-market, the Smithfield as well\r\nas the Hay-market of Edinburgh, lying on the south side of the\r\nCastle-hill, awaited there the proceedings of the enemy.\r\n\r\nOn the twenty-ninth of September, a letter was sent to the Provost of\r\nEdinburgh by General Guest, intimating, that, unless a communication\r\nwere kept up between the city and the castle, he should be under the\r\nnecessity of using cannon to dislodge the Highlanders. It was said that\r\nGuest had an order from the Government, signed by the Marquis of\r\nTweedale, empowering him to lay the city in ashes if the citizens did\r\nnot remove the Highlanders from their quarters. A message was dispatched\r\nfrom the Provost to General Guest obtaining a respite for that night;\r\nbut, meantime, the utmost consternation prevailed in the town. Twelve\r\no'clock at night was the hour fixed upon for the execution of this\r\nthreat of the enemy; and, although many who reasoned did not believe in\r\nthe existence of the order, the lower classes were seized with a panic,\r\nand the streets were crowded with women and children running towards the\r\ngates, and with people removing their property to more secure quarters.\r\nWhen the clocks struck twelve, the hour fixed in General Guest's\r\nmessage, the noise of the cannon was heard firing upon the principal\r\nstreets; but the Highlanders were all under shelter, and only a few poor\r\ninhabitants were injured. Nothing was heard except imprecations on that\r\nGovernment which had issued so cruel an order, since it was quite out of\r\nthe power of the citizens to dislodge the Highlanders from their\r\nquarters. But the firing was soon intermitted; and whether the garrison\r\nhad private orders only to threaten, or whether they found it\r\nimpossible to execute so barbarous an order, is unknown. They spared the\r\ncity generally, and only directed their fire to any place where they\r\nfancied that they saw a Highlander.\r\n\r\nOn the following morning a deputation of citizens waited on the\r\nChevalier, and showed him General Guest's letter. He immediately\r\nreplied, that he was surprised and concerned at the barbarity of the\r\norder, but that if, out of compassion for the city, he were to remove\r\nhis guards, the castle might with equal reason summon him to quit the\r\ntown, and abandon all the advantages of which he was possessed. A\r\nrespite of a day was afterwards obtained; and subsequently for six days,\r\nin case the Highlanders would abstain from firing at the castle; and a\r\ndispatch to London was sent to obtain a mitigation of the order in\r\ncouncil.\r\n\r\nMeantime, on the first of October, the Highlanders fired; whether at\r\nsome people who were carrying provisions to the castle, or at the castle\r\nitself, is uncertain. Reprisals were instantly made by a heavy\r\ncannonading and small shot. The firing continued for some days, bringing\r\nterror to the hearts of those who lived remote from the scene of danger;\r\nwhilst the aged and infirm were carried out of that noble city, thus\r\nthreatened with destruction. Sir Walter Scott observes, that the\r\ngeneration of his own time alone can remember Edinburgh in peace,\r\nundisturbed by civil commotion. The fathers of that generation\r\nremembered the days of 1745--_their_ fathers the disturbances of 1715.\r\nThe fathers of those who had witnessed the rebellion of 1715 could\r\nremember the revolution of 1688.\r\n\r\nThe merciful temper of the young Chevalier saved the city of Edinburgh.\r\nAt first he resolved to continue the blockade; and he renewed his former\r\norders, prohibiting any person from going to the castle without a pass\r\nfrom his secretary, and threatening any one who was disobedient to this\r\nproclamation with instant death. But, when he beheld the distress to\r\nwhich the firing had already reduced the city,--then, let it be\r\nremembered, comprised within boundaries of very moderate extent,--he\r\nissued another proclamation, expressing his deep concern for the many\r\nmurders which were committed upon the innocent inhabitants of the city,\r\nso contrary to the laws of war, to the truce granted to the city, and\r\neven exceeding the powers given. His humanity had, therefore, yielded to\r\nthe barbarity of his enemy; the blockade of the castle was taken off,\r\nand the threatened punishment suspended.[52]\r\n\r\nThe army of Charles Edward was now increasing daily; and, in consequence\r\nof the reports which were circulated in the metropolis, a panic spread\r\nthere, of which no estimate can be made without consulting the\r\nnewspapers of that time. Among other writers who employed their talents\r\nin inveighing against the cause of James Stuart, was the celebrated\r\nHenry Fielding, whose papers in the _True Patriot_ upon the subject\r\npresent a curious insight into those transient states of public feeling,\r\nwhich perished almost as soon as expressed. The rapidity of the progress\r\nmade by the insurgents is declared by his powerful pen to have been\r\nunprecedented. \"Can History,\" he writes, \"produce an instance parallel\r\nto this,--of six or seven men landing in a powerful nation, in\r\nopposition to the inclination of the people, in defiance of a vast and\r\nmighty army? (For, though the greater part of this army was not then in\r\nthe kingdom, it was so nearly within call, that every man of them might,\r\nwithin the compass of a few days, or weeks at farthest, have been\r\nbrought home and landed in any part of it.) If we consider, I say, this\r\nhandful of men landing in the most desolate corner, among a set of poor,\r\nnaked, hungry, disarmed slaves, abiding there with impunity till they\r\nhad, as it were, in the face of a large body of his Majesty's troops\r\ncollected a kind of army, or rather rabble, together, it will be\r\nextremely difficult to assign any adequate cause whatsoever, for this\r\nunexampled success, without recurring to one, of whose great efficacy we\r\nhave frequent instances in sacred history: I mean, the just judgment of\r\nGod against an offending people.\" The state of public morals, Fielding\r\nconsiders, to have drawn down upon society this signal visitation of\r\nProvidence. \"Indeed, such monstrous impieties and iniquities have I both\r\nseen and heard of, within these last three years, during my sojourning\r\nin what is called the world, particularly the last winter, while I\r\ntarried in the great city, that, while I verily believe we are the\r\nsilliest people under Heaven in every other light, we are wiser than\r\nSodom in wickedness.\"[53] The consternation of the sister kingdom had\r\nnow, indeed, become general; on the slightest report of foreign ships\r\nbeing seen in the Downs, the dismay of the London citizens was extreme:\r\nand such was the liberality, or such were the fears of the inhabitants\r\nof the county of York, the capital of which may almost have been deemed,\r\nin those days, a northern metropolis, that forty thousand pounds were\r\nsubscribed for its defence, after a grave and mournful address of the\r\narchbishop of that diocese.[54]\r\n\r\nWhen the Prince had determined to take off the blockade, and indeed had\r\nactually resolved to evacuate Edinburgh and to march southwards, he sent\r\norders to Lord George Murray to nail the cannon upon the city walls, and\r\nto retire to Musselburgh and Dalkeith. But the sagacious Lord George,\r\napprehending no further cannonading from the castle, begged permission\r\nnot to make a precipitate retreat, and obtained leave to continue three\r\nweeks longer in Edinburgh, during which time the town remained in a much\r\nquieter state than it had been heretofore.\r\n\r\nWhilst Lord George Murray was quartered in Edinburgh, he communicated\r\nfrequently with his wife, the Lady Emilia, who remained with her\r\nchildren at Tullibardine. That lady seems to have taken a deep interest\r\nin the events which so deeply concerned her family. She was the first to\r\ncommunicate to the Marquis of Tullibardine the intelligence of the\r\nvictory of Preston-Pans. \"I pray God,\" she says in her postscript, \"to\r\nprosper his Royal Highness's arms, and congratulate your Grace upon his\r\nhappy success.\" A gentleman, who had seen her husband after the battle,\r\nhad brought to the anxious wife the tidings of his success.\r\n\r\nTowards the end of October the Prince resolved to march into England,\r\nwithout waiting any longer for the landing of French auxiliaries, or\r\neven for the arrival of the friendly Clans of Frasers and Mackintoshes,\r\nwho were ready to march from the north to join Charles Edward. By some\r\nof the Chevalier's advisers he was recommended to go to Berwick; but\r\nthis was a scheme counteracted by the counsels of Lord George Murray,\r\nwho, in the presence of the principal officers, represented it as \"a\r\nthing at least of great difficulty, and of not so great use as to lose\r\ntime, which is precious.\" Lord George therefore proposed marching into\r\nEngland by the other road; but, to conceal their design, he advised that\r\nthe army should be divided into three columns; one to go by Kelso, the\r\nsecond by Moffat, and a third by Galashiels, Selkirk, and Hawick; so\r\nthat all the columns should join on an appointed day near Carlisle. The\r\nplan was approved; and, the secret being very well kept, on the\r\nthirty-first of October the army prepared to march.[55] It is\r\nremarkable, that, during the whole period of their stay in Edinburgh, no\r\ngeneral review of the Jacobite forces had taken place. The consequent\r\nuncertainty of what was really the amount of those forces, which existed\r\nin England, fostered the general panic. \"Abundance of people,\" writes\r\nMr. Maxwell, \"friends as well as enemies, had made it their business to\r\nfind out the number of the Prince's army, but to no purpose. Great pains\r\nhad been taken to conceal its weakness.\"[56]\r\n\r\nIn order to conceal the design upon England, a scheme was formed,\r\nallowing three days to elapse between the marching of the two great\r\ndivisions of the army; and accordingly the Prince, attended by Lord\r\nGeorge Murray, took up his abode at the palace of Dalkeith, and here he\r\nremained until the third of November. In this princely abode the young\r\nrepresentative of the Stuart line may have remembered the adverse\r\nfortunes of Queen Mary, and the bold character of the Regent Morton, to\r\nwhom the castle of Dalkeith belonged, when it had acquired from the\r\ncharacter of its owner the name of the \"Lion's Den.\" After the death of\r\nMorton, the barony of Dalkeith was included in the attainder; and the\r\ncastle had been considered, during many years, as public property, and\r\nwas inhabited by General Monk during the usurpation of Cromwell.\r\n\r\nBut, long before Charles Edward made it his temporary residence,\r\nDalkeith had been repaired and beautified by Anne Duchess of Buccleugh\r\nand Monmouth, the widow of the unfortunate Duke of Monmouth. It was, as\r\nit is now, an appropriate residence for royalty. The more ancient part\r\nof the building has, it is true, lost its castellated appearance; but\r\nthe beautiful site on the steep banks of the Eske, and the thickness of\r\nthe walls, are still proofs of former strength and great importance, to\r\nwhich the contiguity of Dalkeith to Edinburgh conduce; whilst the\r\njunction of the north and south Esk in the park add to the beauties of\r\nthis noble demesne.\r\n\r\nThe Chevalier Johnstone was still aide-de-camp to Lord George Murray,\r\nand remained to accompany the General on his march. Among those with\r\nwhom the exertions of Lord George were frequently united was Mr.\r\nO'Sullivan, an Irish officer, and the object of Charles Edward's\r\npartiality and confidence, and he was a man of considerable abilities.\r\nHaving received his education in a Romish college abroad, O'Sullivan had\r\noriginally entered into priest's orders. It was his lot to be\r\nrecommended as a tutor to the son of Marshal Maillebois, who, perceiving\r\nin the young ecclesiastic proofs of a genius better adapted to the use\r\nof the sword than to the gravity of the gown, encouraged him to apply\r\nhimself to the profession of arms. There were not wanting in those days\r\nopportunities of cultivating a military turn, and Corsica was the scene\r\nof Mr. O'Sullivan's first exploits. Here he acted as secretary to\r\nMarshal Villebois; an office of no slight responsibility, for the\r\nMarshal was tainted with the prevalent vice of the day, and scarcely\r\never left the dinner-table in a state fit for public business.\r\nO'Sullivan, therefore, in the course of those oppressions which the\r\nFrench inflicted on the inhabitants of Corsica, acquired not only great\r\nexperience in business, but also in military affairs; as well as\r\nknowledge in what is termed the art of making irregular war. To this\r\nacquirement he afterwards added another; for, having served a campaign\r\non the Rhine, it was said by a French General, under whom he fought,\r\nthat his knowledge of the regular art of war was equal to that of any\r\nGeneral in Europe. To his abilities were attributed much of the rapid\r\nsuccess of those whom it was the fashion of the newspapers of the day to\r\ndescribe as \"a handful of savages,\" but whom the loungers about the\r\nEnglish court soon learned to dread.[57]\r\n\r\nIt is now necessary, before entering into details of fresh operations,\r\nto review the proceedings of Lord George Murray during the last few\r\nweeks, and to give some notion how he exercised the functions of his\r\ngeneralship. His chief sources of annoyance, besides the intrigues in\r\nthe Prince's council, were the deserters from the Jacobite army. Before\r\nleaving Edinburgh, Lord George Murray had despatched a number of\r\nprisoners to Logierait; and the following letter shows how rigid were\r\nthe instructions which he peremptorily sent to his brother, the Marquis\r\nof Tullibardine, at Perth. The correspondence of Lord George Murray\r\nproves him to have been a man of a stern, hard nature; and effaces much\r\nof the impression produced by his united valour and clemency in the\r\nfield of battle.\r\n\r\n    \"Dear Brother,\r\n\r\n    \"Things vary so much from time to time that I can say nothing\r\n    certain as yet, but refer you to the enclosed letter; but depend\r\n    upon having nothing express from me with you before Monday night.\r\n    But, in the mean time, you must resolve to be ready to march on\r\n    Tuesday morning, by Keinacan and Tay Bridge, so as to be at Crieff\r\n    on Wednesday; and even that way, if you do your best, you will be\r\n    half a march behind: but you will be able to make up that on\r\n    Thursday, when I reckon we may meet at Dunblane or Doun: but of this\r\n    more fully in my next. It is believed for certain that Cope will\r\n    embark at Aberdeen.\r\n\r\n    \"I hope the meal was with you before this--thirty-five bolls--for\r\n    it was at Inuar last night. It shall be my study to have more meal\r\n    with you on Monday night, for you must distribute a peck a man; and,\r\n    cost what it will, there must be pocks to each man, to contain a\r\n    peck or two for the men to have always with them. Buy linen, yarn,\r\n    or anything; for these pocks are of absolute necessity--nothing can\r\n    be done without them. His Royal Highness desires you to acquaint\r\n    Glenmoriston and Glencoe, if they come your way, of this intended\r\n    march, so that they may go by Tay Bridge (if you please, with you);\r\n    and what meal you can spare, let them have. You may please tell your\r\n    own people that there is a project to get arms for them.\r\n\r\n                                                  \"Yours, adieu!\r\n                                                    \"GEORGE MURRAY.\"\r\n\r\n    \"Saturday, nine at night.\"\r\n\r\n\"For God's sake!\" he adds in another part of his letter, \"cause some\r\neffectual measures to be taken about the deserters: I would have their\r\nhouses and crops destroyed, for an example to others, and themselves\r\npunished in a most rigorous manner.\"\r\n\r\nAnother source of anxiety was connected with the prisoners of war. It\r\nwas difficult to know how to dispose of them. The island in the Loch of\r\nClunie, not far from Dunkeld, was afterwards considered by the Marquis\r\nas the most suitable place for the reception of the prisoners; and was\r\nconceded by Lady Ogilvy, the daughter of Lord Airlie, for that purpose,\r\nin her father's absence. In a letter addressed by Tullibardine to the\r\nEarl of Airlie, to whom the Loch of Clunie belonged, a spirit of\r\nkindness and consideration is shown, very different to the stern\r\nmandates of Lord George Murray. \"I presume,\" writes the Marquis, \"your\r\nLor'ship will not only cheerfully make everything be carefully prepared\r\nfor their reception, but also contribute what's possible to prevent any\r\ndangerous mutiny or escape among them.\" Although describing these\r\nprisoners as a \"troublesome and dangerous set of people,\" he recommends\r\nno harsh measures, except precautionary vigilance.[58] Beef, mutton, and\r\nmeal were provided and paid for by the Marquis, who, ultimately, was\r\nobliged to quarter a considerable number of the prisoners in barns and\r\nother outhouses near Logierait. This charge appears to have been very\r\nunwelcome to the good old Tullibardine, who talks to his sister in law,\r\nLady Emilia Murray, of \"ane unworthy pack of prisoners that is sent\r\nus.\"[59]\r\n\r\nMeantime, the want of money for the supply of the garrison at Perth was\r\nanother source of uneasiness to Lord George Murray. Many\r\ndisappointments, on this score, occurred. \"I told you,\" Lord George\r\nwrites to his brother, \"that some gentlemen had promised to his Royal\r\nHighness some money in loan, more besides what they already gave; but it\r\nis to their ladies you will please to write, as they appear to do the\r\nthing, and not the husbands.\"[60] \"I have been as pressing,\" he says in\r\nanother letter to the Marquis, \"about money to be sent to you, both\r\nformerly and now, as if my life depended upon it. There is three hundred\r\npounds sent at present, mostly in specie. You are desired to write to\r\npeople in the country to advance money, particularly to Lady Methven;\r\nwhich if they do not immediately, their corn and other effects will be\r\nseized.\"[61]\r\n\r\nPreviously to his march southwards, Prince Charles appointed Viscount\r\nStrathallan Governor, and Deputy Governor of Perth, and\r\nCommander-in-chief during the absence of the Marquis of Tullibardine,\r\nwhom Lord George Murray now summoned to join him, considering that the\r\naddition of the Marquis's tenantry to the army was of the utmost\r\nimportance. \"I am extremely anxious,\" he writes, \"to have our men here,\r\nat least as many as would make Lord Nairn's battalion, and mine, five\r\nhundred each; for at present I could get them supply'd with guns,\r\ntargets, tents, and, those who want them, shoes also: but if they be not\r\nhere soon, them that come first, will be first serv'd.\"\r\n\r\nThese directions were reiterated, and were also repeated by the pen of\r\nLady Emilia Murray, to whom her lord sent immediate accounts of all that\r\noccurred. This spirited and indefatigable help-meet resided generally at\r\nTullibardine. \"These,\" she writes, \"were his words, 'I entreat, for\r\nGod's sake, that the Duke of Atholl send off the men here immediately,\r\nor they will be too late for arms, targets, tents, &c.; nay, for our\r\nmarch, which begins on Thursday.\" All this haste and impetuosity was\r\nmeekly but decidedly resisted by the slow Marquis of Tullibardine. He\r\nthus writes in reply to one of his brother's most urgent entreaties:\r\n\r\n\"About ten o'clock in the afternoon I received your express, dated the\r\nfourth, four o'clock, afternoon, and am very much concerned to find that\r\nit is morally impossible for me, or any of the men in these parts, to be\r\nup with you against Thursday night, the day you say it is resolved, in a\r\nCouncil of War, to march southward. Did any of us endeavour to make too\r\nmuch haste to join the Prince, I am afraid we should be like a good milk\r\ncow, that gives a great pail of milk, and after, kicks it down with her\r\nfoot. Forgive the comparison.\"[62]\r\n\r\nOther apprehensions also increased the desire of Lord George to begin\r\nhis march. \"I am desired to let you know,\" he writes to the Marquis of\r\nTullibardine, \"that there is one Kimber, an anabaptist, who came from\r\nLondon with a design to assassinate the Prince; he is about twenty-seven\r\nyears old, black hair, of a middling stature, and talks fluently and\r\nbluntly about his travels in the West Indies.\" This man, it was\r\nsuspected, afterwards changed his name to Geffreys. He was supposed to\r\nhave even been received by the Marquis of Tullibardine at his table, and\r\nto have obtained a pass from him; but nothing more was disclosed, as far\r\nas the correspondence informs us, touching this attempt.\r\n\r\nLord George continued in a fever of vexation and anxiety at the delay of\r\nhis brother, upon whose arrival at the camp, the march to England was to\r\nbegin. Public affairs in England favoured, as he justly thought, the\r\nmost decisive measures. \"Everything,\" he writes to his brother, \"is in\r\ngreat confusion in England, particularly in London, where credite is at\r\na stand. The greatest banquiers have stopt payment; all would go to our\r\nwish, if we could but march instantly. If you delay longer,\" Lord George\r\nadds, \"it will be the utter ruine of the cause. You should wait for\r\nnobody but your own men.\" The arrival of supplies from France, of arms\r\nand ammunition, though they were represented as being very inferior in\r\nquantity to what had been expected, gave encouragement to the hopes of\r\nthe sanguine; and re-assured in some degree, even the anxious mind of\r\nLord George Murray.\r\n\r\nBefore finally quitting Perth, the Marquis of Tullibardine received a\r\ncompliment from the gentlemen prisoners of war there, which proved how\r\nsoldierlike and courteous his conduct towards them had been. They\r\ninquired whether he would have morning levees, since they wished \"to\r\nwait upon him.\" To this the Marquis replied, with his thanks, that,\r\nalthough not fond of ceremonious visits, he would always be \"glad to\r\ncultivate an acquaintance with gentlemen whose actions show they are\r\ntrue Britons, by standing up for and supporting the ancient constitution\r\nand liberties of well-born subjects, whose honour is engaged to shake\r\noff the slavery of a foreign yoke.\"[63]\r\n\r\nNotwithstanding all the remonstrances of Lord George, who had reiterated\r\nhis entreaties during the whole of the month of October, the winter was\r\nfar advanced before the Marquis left his castle of Blair to proceed\r\nsouthwards.[64]\r\n\r\nOn the thirty-first of October, a considerable force took the road to\r\nDuddingstone, a small village at the foot of Arthur's Seat; presenting,\r\nbefore the Highland army poured in upon its serene precincts, a scene of\r\nrepose and quiet beauty, finely contrasted with the clamour of the city,\r\nand the grandeur of the rugged hill.\r\n\r\nForemost rode Lord Elcho, commanding the first troop of horse-guards,\r\nconsisting of sixty-two gentlemen, and their servants, under five\r\nofficers, forming altogether a troop of a hundred and twenty horse. A\r\nsmaller troop, not amounting to more than forty horse, followed under\r\nthe command of Arthur Elphinstone, afterwards Lord Balmerino. Then came\r\na little squadron of horse grenadiers, with whom were incorporated the\r\nPerthshire gentlemen, in the absence of their own commander, Lord\r\nStrathallan, who was left Governor of Perth. The whole of this squadron\r\ndid not amount to a hundred. It was commanded by William Earl of\r\nKilmarnock, the representative of an ancient and noble family, which, as\r\nan historian remarks, \"sometimes matched with the blood-royal.\" \"He\r\nwas,\" adds the same writer, \"in the flower of his age, being about forty\r\nyears old. The elegance of his person, and comeliness of his features,\r\nwhich were every way handsome, bespake internal beauties.\"[65] It is\r\nremarkable, that, at this very time, the young Lord Boyd, Lord\r\nKilmarnock's son, held a commission in the British army and fought\r\nagainst the Jacobites.\r\n\r\nThe Aberdeen and Bamffshire gentlemen, amounting with their servants to\r\na hundred and twenty, with seventy or eighty hussars, were commanded by\r\nLord Pitsligo; but Mr. Murray, \"who would have a share at least of\r\neverything,\" was their colonel.[66]\r\n\r\nThe infantry consisted of thirteen little battalions, for the\r\nHighlanders would not be commanded by any but their own chiefs; and it\r\nwas necessary therefore to have as many regiments as there were Clans.\r\n\r\nOn the third of November, the Prince marched from Dalkeith on foot, at\r\nthe head of the Clans, who were commanded under him by Lord George\r\nMurray. The acclamations of the people of Edinburgh, who flocked in\r\ncrowds to witness the departure of the army, were loud and friendly. Yet\r\nit is remarkable, that in spite of his long residence in that city, in\r\nspite of his hereditary claims on its inhabitants, and of the popularity\r\nof his manners, the party of the Prince in that capital never increased\r\nin proportion to his expectations. This indifference to the cause of\r\nCharles Edward has with much reason been attributed to the strong and\r\nunalterable distrust entertained by all zealous Presbyterians of any\r\napproach to Popery: the firmness of the Scottish character to a\r\nprinciple may be plainly read in the reluctance of the Lowlanders to\r\nhazard, even for a Stuart, the safety of what they esteem to be their\r\nvital interests.[67]\r\n\r\nIt was, however, a fine, although a mournful sight, when the Clans\r\ntaking the road to London left Dalkeith. It was indeed only after long\r\nand anxious deliberation, that these brave men had resolved to risk an\r\nadvance to England, without any certain expectation of a rising in that\r\ncountry; yet there were many among the chiefs who went forth that day,\r\nand among these were some of the bravest and the most determined who\r\n\"trusted in themselves alone.\"[68] Among those who were declared\r\nsecretly to have desponded of success, and yet to have gone on in the\r\ncareer from a sense of honour, was Lord George Murray.\r\n\r\nThe march to England was very judiciously planned and well executed. \"It\r\nresembled,\" observes the Chevalier Johnstone, \"on a small scale, that of\r\nMarshal Saxe some years before, when he advanced to lay siege to\r\nMaestricht.\" The Prince went day after day on foot, contrary to general\r\nexpectation; for it was thought that he would only have done so at the\r\nbeginning to encourage the soldiers: but in dirty lanes, and in deep\r\nsnow, the youth reared in seclusion and luxury took his chance with the\r\ncommon men, and could scarcely ever be prevailed upon even to get on\r\nhorseback to ford a river. \"It's not to be imagined,\" writes his\r\naffectionate partisan and historian Maxwell, \"how much this manner of\r\nbringing himself down to a level with the men, and his affable behaviour\r\nto the meanest of them, endeared him to the army.\"[69] On arriving at\r\nLauder, hearing that some of the Highlanders had remained behind with a\r\nview, it was thought, of deserting, Charles got on horseback before it\r\nwas light, rode back two or three miles, and brought the stragglers with\r\nhim.[70] On the fourth instant he reached Kelso. Such was the success of\r\nthis well-contrived march, and such the secrecy with which it was made,\r\nthat Marshal Wade, who was at Newcastle with eleven thousand men,\r\ncontinued to cover and protect that place, without an idea of advancing\r\nto intercept the Highland troops. Indeed, the secret was so well kept,\r\nthat hardly any subordinate officer in the Prince's service knew where\r\nthe junction of the columns was intended to take place.[71]\r\n\r\nArduous as the Prince's march had been to Kelso, it was enlivened by\r\nsome incidents in which the stern and haughty Lord George Murray must\r\nhave participated, as well as the gallant young Chevalier. On passing\r\nthrough Preston Hall gate, the first morning of his march, the Prince\r\nfound breakfast there prepared for him by order of the Duchess of\r\nGordon, for which act that lady was deprived of a yearly pension of one\r\nthousand pounds, given to her in consideration of her Grace's having\r\neducated her family in the Protestant religion.[72] As he passed Fala\r\nDanes, the ladies of Whitborough, who were the sisters of a zealous\r\nadherent of the Prince, Robert Anderson, entertained Charles and his\r\nchief officers with a collation in the open air. The royal guest, being\r\nasked to leave some memorial of his visit, cut from the hilt of his\r\nsword a piece of crimson velvet, which is still preserved at\r\nWhitborough. At Lauder, Charles took up his abode in Hurlestane castle,\r\nthe seat of the Earl of Lauderdale. From Kelso, Charles dispatched the\r\nguards across the Tweed; not so much to reconnoitre, as to amuse the\r\nenemy: they went some miles into the country, and, when they came to any\r\nEnglish villages, made inquiries as to what reception and accommodation\r\nthe army might meet with on arriving there. The object of this\r\nmanoeuvre was to keep General Wade in suspense as to the movements of\r\nthe army, and to prevent his marching towards Carlisle. Such was the\r\nsuccess of these artifices, that Wade, who had decided on a march to\r\nBerwick, countermanded that order. On the sixth of November the Jacobite\r\nforces crossed the Tweed: that river was scarcely fordable; but the\r\nHighlanders were elated beyond measure, and, even when bathed in the\r\nwater, expressed their delight by discharging their pieces and uttering\r\ncries of joy. Such was their humour, that they gave the horses which\r\nwere taken from the enemy the name of General Cope, by way of expressing\r\ntheir contempt for the fugitive Englishman.\r\n\r\nAmid indications of homage, especially from the women of the town of\r\nJedburgh, who ran forth to kiss the young hero's hand, Charles entered\r\nJedburgh, and took up his residence at an inn in the centre of the town,\r\ncalled the Nag's Head. On the following day he led his troops over the\r\nRule water, famous for the warriors of old who dwelt near its banks; and\r\nover the Knot o' Gate into Liddiesdale, \"noted in former times for its\r\npredatory hands, as in more recent times for its primitive yeomen and\r\nromantic minstrelsy.\"[73] After a march of twenty-five miles, the Prince\r\narrived at Haggiehaugh, upon Liddel water; here he slept, the\r\nHighlanders finding their quarters for the night as well as they could\r\nin barns, or byres, or houses, as their fortune might be. On the eighth\r\nof November Charles Edward, proceeding down the Liddel water, met the\r\ncolumn of horse which had taken the middle road by Selkirk and Hawick.\r\nThey joined him at Gritmill Green upon the banks of the Esk, four miles\r\nbelow Langholm. Shortly afterwards the first division of the Prince's\r\narmy crossed the river, which here separates the two kingdoms, as the\r\nTweed does at Berwick, and trod upon English ground. That event was\r\nsignalized by a loud shout, whilst the Highlanders unsheathed their\r\nswords. But soon a general panic was spread among the soldiery, by the\r\nintelligence that Cameron of Lochiel, in drawing his sword, had drawn\r\nblood from his hand.[74] This was regarded as an omen of mournful\r\nimport. What was of much more vital consequence was the incessant\r\ndesertion of the troops, especially from the column which the Prince\r\ncommanded. Arms were afterwards found flung away in the fields, and the\r\nroads to Lanarkshire and Stirlingshire were crowded with these\r\nrenegades. This circumstance Lord George Murray accounted for in these\r\nterms, when, upon a subsequent occasion, he wrote to his brother,\r\ncomplaining of the fact: \"We are quite affronted with the scandalous\r\ndesertion of our men: it was the taking money instead of the best men,\r\nwhich is the occasion of all the evil; for good men, once coming out,\r\nwould have been piqued in honour, and not deserted us on the point of\r\nfighting the enemy.\"[75]\r\n\r\nSuch was the skill and secrecy with which the whole of this march had\r\nbeen planned, chiefly by the suggestions of Lord George Murray, that the\r\nforces were very much surprised on finding that all the three columns\r\narrived nearly at the same time, on a heath in England, about two miles\r\ndistant from the city of Carlisle. The plan was executed with such\r\nprecision, that there was not an interval of two hours between the\r\njunction of the columns.[76]\r\n\r\nIt was now resolved to invest Carlisle. Few cities in England have been\r\nthe scenes of more momentous events than that which was now the object\r\nof the Chevalier's efforts. Long the centre of border hostilities, it\r\nwas the fate of Carlisle to be at once the witness of the insurrection\r\nof 1745, and the scene of punishment of those who were concerned in that\r\nmovement.\r\n\r\nIn modern times, the importance of Carlisle as a fortress has inevitably\r\ndeclined; and it is at present regarded as a venerable relic of former\r\nstrength, rather than as a place of defence. But, in ancient days, the\r\nWarden of the Marches, selected from among the nobles of tried fidelity\r\nand courage, attracted to the castle of Carlisle a host of youthful\r\naspirants for military renown, who there sought to be trained to arms,\r\namid contests not depending upon a single achievement, but requiring\r\nwatchfulness, patient labour, and skill, slowly and painfully to be\r\nacquired.\r\n\r\nFounded by William Rufus, who restored the city after it had lain two\r\nhundred years in ruins, owing to the depredations of the Danes; and\r\nimproved and enlarged successively by Richard the Third and Henry the\r\nEighth; the castle had received the unhappy Mary Stuart: and here she\r\nwas treated with an insidious respect which soon threw off the mask. In\r\nthe time of Queen Elizabeth, the citadel, which was entirely built by\r\nHenry the Eighth, fell into decay; and after the prohibition of all\r\nincursions on England on the part of King James the Sixth, Carlisle\r\nceased to be of so much importance as a military possession; and its\r\nposition, as one of the keys of England, did not avail to secure any\r\ngreat attention to its dilapidated state. At the time of Charles\r\nEdward's arrival in Cumberland, the fortifications of the City had been\r\nneglected for several centuries; but it still bore the outward aspect of\r\nformer strength.\r\n\r\nThe works, which had thus been left to moulder away, were in the form of\r\na triangle, and were separated from the town by a deep ditch. Upon the\r\neast angle, which is also cut off from the Parade by a ditch, is seated\r\nthe Castle, properly so called, though the whole generally goes by that\r\nname. These works consist of a dungeon, the walls of which are twelve\r\nfeet in thickness; a tower, called the Captain's Tower; two gates, one\r\nto each ward; there being an inward and an outward ward. In the castle\r\nthere is a great chamber, and a hall, but no storehouse for ammunition.\r\nIn the walls of the town, three gateway towers, a semi-circular bastion\r\ncalled Springeld Tower, and the citadel, complete the fortifications:\r\nunless we comprise several square towers with which the city walls are\r\nfurnished; especially one at the west sally-port, and the Tile Tower,\r\nboth of considerable strength.[77]\r\n\r\nThe foreground of the castle is formed of green and level meadows washed\r\nby the river Eden; and, in modern days, two fine stone bridges add to\r\nthe beauty of the scene. The hanging banks are crowned with the village\r\nand church of Stanwix, and the mountains of Bewcastle form the distance.\r\n\"To the south,\" to use the words of Hutchinson in his History of\r\nCumberland, \"you command the plains towards Penrith, shut in on either\r\nside with a vast range of mountains, over which Crossfell and Skiddaw\r\nare distinctly seen greatly eminent. To the east a varied tract of\r\ncultivated country, scattered over with villages and hamlets, mingle\r\nbeautifully with woodlands on the extensive landscape; the distant\r\nhorizon formed by the heights of Northumberland. To the west, the Solway\r\nFrith sparkles out, a shining expanse of waters, flowing along a\r\ncultivated tract of land on the English coast; on the other, the bold\r\nheights of Weffel and a chain of mountains extend towards the sea.\"[78]\r\n\r\nWhen Charles Edward spread out his forces before Carlisle, the garrison\r\nwithin its mouldering walls was composed of a company of invalids, under\r\nthe command of Colonel Durand; but the Cumberland militia were almost\r\nall collected within the city walls. Colonel Durand, however, as well as\r\nthe Mayor of the place, showed a spirit of defence; and the latter\r\nissued a proclamation informing the inhabitants that he was not\r\nPaterson, a Scotchman, but Pattieson, a true-born Englishman, who was\r\ndetermined to hold out the city to the last. Since Charles had no\r\nbattering cannon, it appeared impossible to reduce the castle if it\r\nwere well-defended; but it was resolved to make the attempt. Whilst he\r\nwas meditating an attack, the news that Wade's army was marching from\r\nNewcastle drew him for some days from continuing these operations. The\r\nreport proved, however, to be groundless; and the Duke of Perth was\r\nsent, therefore, with several regiments to begin the siege.\r\n\r\nThe Jacobite army had all crossed the river Eden at Rowcliff, four miles\r\nbelow Carlisle; and next day they marched to Harraby, Blackhall, and\r\nBoutcherby, to the southward of Carlisle. At Harraby Lord George Murray\r\nremained, in order to cover the siege; that place being most contiguous\r\nto Carlisle, and on the highway to Penrith: the other troops under his\r\ncommand lay in the adjoining villages. The Duke of Perth had the\r\ndirection of the trenches. It was here that an event occurred, which\r\nshortly afterwards excited the greatest discontent among the followers\r\nof Charles Edward.[79]\r\n\r\nThe attack upon the city was made from Stanwix Bank; the Marquis of\r\nTullibardine, who had at length joined the insurgent army, with his\r\ntenantry, assisting the Duke of Perth. As it was market-day on the\r\nninth, when the Jacobites made their appearance within a quarter of a\r\nmile of Carlisle, the Highland soldiers were mingled with the\r\nmarket-people returning home, so that the garrison dared not fire upon\r\nthem. On the following day, the city was attacked in three places; but\r\nthe Marquis of Tullibardine, who commanded a four-gun battery, planted\r\nat the entrance of a lane, was heard to say to his followers,\r\n\"Gentlemen, we have not metal for them; retreat.\" After three days'\r\nattack, however, the courage of Mr. Pattieson, and the strength of the\r\ngarrison, gave way. The valiant Mayor forgot his English birth so far as\r\nto hang out a white flag, and to request a capitulation for the town.\r\nThe garrison and townsmen of Carlisle, in the opinion of the writers of\r\nthe day, merited no more credit than that of Edinburgh, in their defence\r\nand capitulation. In the siege, the Highland army had only one man\r\nkilled, and another wounded; and the reduction of Carlisle gave great,\r\nbut not lasting, lustre to their arms.\r\n\r\nOn entering Carlisle, Lord George Murray is said, in the newspapers of\r\nthe day, to have encountered an old friend, who asked him how he could\r\nbe so rash as to lend himself to the aid of a hopeless and futile\r\ninvasion. To this Lord George is declared to have replied, that he was\r\nwell aware that the cause was hopeless; but that, having once engaged to\r\nmaintain it, honour compelled him to continue his exertions.[80] It was\r\nnot, however, long before those fatal dissensions appeared which\r\neffectually defeated all that valour or fidelity could effect to save\r\nCharles Edward from defeat.\r\n\r\nIt was, perhaps, the well-earned popularity of the Duke of Perth, his\r\nforbearance, and the gratitude evinced towards him by the inhabitants of\r\nCarlisle, as he rode triumphantly through their city, that first roused\r\nthe jealousy of Lord George Murray's proud nature. The disinterested\r\nconduct of the Duke of Perth, as soon as he became informed of the\r\nsentiments entertained towards him by Lord George Murray, was worthy of\r\nhimself. That brave and excellent young man modestly withdrew from a\r\nrivalry which, he justly concluded, must be injurious to the cause of\r\nthat Prince whose interests he had espoused; for few men could cope with\r\nthe natural abilities, the force of character, and the experience of\r\nLord George. He was by far the most able general that appeared in either\r\nof the two insurrections in the cause of the Stuarts. \"His personal\r\nhardihood and bravery,\" remarks Lord Mahon, \"might be rivalled by many\r\nothers; but none could vie with him in planning a campaign, providing\r\nagainst disasters, or improving victory.\"\r\n\r\nWhilst the Jacobite forces lay encamped near Carlisle, certain\r\ndifferences of opinion arose in the Council. There were some who had\r\neven thought that it would be desirable, before investing Carlisle, to\r\nreturn to Scotland to collect a greater force. Lord George Murray,\r\nseconded by the Duke of Perth, had opposed this cautious proposal; and\r\nrecommended that part of the army should stay at Brampton, and the rest\r\ngo to blockade Carlisle. The Duke of Perth had seconded this scheme, and\r\nit had accordingly been decided that Lord George should command the\r\nblockade, whilst the Duke conducted the battery. The result has been\r\nseen; and the Prince was now master of Carlisle.\r\n\r\nA few days after he had taken possession of the town, a council of war\r\nwas called, to consider what was next to be done. Some of the officers\r\nproposed returning to Scotland; others were in favour of encamping near\r\nCarlisle, and waiting to see whether there would be any rising in\r\nEngland. Others advised marching forwards, by the west of England;\r\narguing, that having Carlisle, happen what might, they had a safe\r\nretreat. Charles Edward declared himself to be of the last-mentioned\r\nopinion, and his inclinations were seconded by Lord George to a certain\r\nextent. He stated the advantages and disadvantages of both propositions;\r\nbut added, that, although he could not venture to advise the Prince to\r\nmarch into England without more encouragement than they had hitherto\r\nreceived, yet he was persuaded that if his Royal Highness marched south,\r\nhis army, though but small, would follow him. Upon this, Charles\r\nimmediately said these words, \"I will venture it.\" \"I spoke,\" adds Lord\r\nGeorge, \"with the more caution, since some things had happened about the\r\ntime of the blockade of Carlisle, and a little before, which had made me\r\ndesirous to serve only as a volunteer, and not as a general officer;\r\nbut, as all the other officers were very pressing with me, I soon laid\r\nthat thought aside.\"[81]\r\n\r\nWhat those circumstances were, Lord George explains in the following\r\nletter to his brother. His difficulties, owing to the want of\r\narrangements, such as his skill and experience might have suggested, had\r\nhe been first in command, appear to have been sufficiently trying. Yet,\r\nin the extract from a letter dated Nov. 15, from Harraby, Lord George\r\ndoes ample justice to the exertions of the Duke of Perth. This epistle\r\nwas written whilst the blockade and battery were going on.\r\n\r\n    \"I am sorry to find that it is impossible to go on so quick with the\r\n    battery of cannon as would have been wished. By the report of those\r\n    I sent there, the ground is marshy, and vastly too much exposed;\r\n    and, notwithstanding all the pains taken by the Duke of Perth, who\r\n    is indefatigable in that service, and who meets with innumerable\r\n    difficulties, I suspect the place pitched upon will not answer. But,\r\n    if the thing be prosecuted, I think it my duty to tell you, so as\r\n    you may represent it to his Royal Highness, that the men posted upon\r\n    the blockade of Carlisle will not expose themselves, either in\r\n    trenches, or all night in the open air, within cannon-shot, or even\r\n    musket-shot of the town, except it be in their turn with the rest of\r\n    the army, and that it be decided by lot who is to mount the guard,\r\n    first night, second, and so on. The way I would propose, if it be\r\n    approved of by a council of war, is as follows:--that fifty men be\r\n    draughted out of each of the battalions that are at Brampton, with\r\n    proper officers, and at least two majors out of the six battalions,\r\n    and be sent to quarter at Butcherby, which, I believe, is within a\r\n    mile of the battery; and, as I suppose, one hundred and fifty men\r\n    will mount guard at the battery. These six battalions will furnish\r\n    two guards; your men will furnish one, General Gordon and Lord\r\n    Ogilvie's one, which, in the whole, makes four guards, or reliefs;\r\n    and I think, by that time, the town will be either taken or the\r\n    blockade removed. I don't mention the Duke of Perth's regiment,\r\n    because they have more than their turn of the duty already, besides\r\n    furnishing workmen, &c. And for Colonel Roy Stuart's regiments, I\r\n    suppose they have the guard of the equipage, &c.; and they will,\r\n    perhaps, be able to furnish some workmen. If anything be done of\r\n    this nature, the sooner I hear of it the better. I ever am, dear\r\n    brother, your most affectionate brother, and faithful humble\r\n    servant,\r\n\r\n                                                \"GEORGE MURRAY.\"[82]\r\n\r\nThis advice was disregarded. A court-martial was held to consider of the\r\nplan suggested by Lord George. By this council the detachments proposed\r\nby Lord George for the relief of the battery were refused, upon the plea\r\nthat those corps had lately encountered all the fatigue of the blockade\r\nat Edinburgh, and that it would not be fair to put them again upon that\r\nservice. On the day after receiving this decision, in the hand-writing\r\nof Secretary Murray, Lord George addressed the following letter to the\r\nPrince. His conduct upon this occasion shows the proud and fiery spirit\r\nof this able commander.\r\n\r\n                                               \"15th November, 1745.\r\n\r\n    \"Sir,\r\n\r\n    \"I cannot but observe how little my advice as a General officer has\r\n    any weight with your Royal Highness, ever since I had the honour of\r\n    a commission from your hands. I therefore take leave to give up my\r\n    commission. But as I ever had a firm attachment to the royal family,\r\n    and in particular to the King my master, I shall go on as a\r\n    volunteer, and design to be this night in the trenches as such, with\r\n    any others that will please to follow me, though I own I think there\r\n    are full few on this post already. Your Royal Highness will please\r\n    order whom you think fit to command on this post, and the other\r\n    parts of the blockade. I have the honour to be, sir, your Royal\r\n    Highness's most faithful and most humble servant,\r\n\r\n                                        (Signed) \"GEORGE MURRAY.[83]\r\n\r\n    \"Lord Elcho has the command till you please to appoint it\r\n    otherwise.\"\r\n\r\nTo his brother, the Marquis of Tullibardine, Lord George wrote still\r\nmore fully. In this letter, after informing the Marquis that he had\r\ngiven up his commission of Lieutenant-General, Lord George complains of\r\na want of confidence on the part of the Prince, in regard to the terms\r\nwhich were to be accepted or rejected in the surrender of Carlisle.\r\nTouching these, Charles Edward, who was now almost completely under the\r\ncontroul of Secretary Murray, acted in a weak and vacillating manner.\r\nWhen pressed by Lord George Murray to give him full instructions, he\r\nhesitated; Lord George entreated him, if he could not decide during his\r\npresence in the camp, that the Prince would send instructions after\r\nhim.[84] \"When he would not come to any fixed resolution before I came\r\naway, I begged his Royal Highness would send his intentions and\r\ninstructions after me, that I might conduct myself by them; but his\r\nsecretary told me plainly, he took that matter to be his province, as he\r\nseems indeed to take everything upon him both as to civil and military.\r\nThere are many other things which have determined me to wish to have no\r\ncommand; and it is some time past since I observed things must go into\r\nutter confusion. I shall show, as a volunteer, that no man wishes more\r\nsuccess to the cause; and I can be of more use charging in the first\r\nrank of your Atholl men than as a general, where I was constantly at a\r\nloss to know what was doing. I am of opinion you should reduce your men\r\nto two battalions; one for Lord Nairn, the other Mr. Mercer. When you\r\nare quartered anywhere, if you have a hole to spare, I shall be as often\r\nwith you as I can; at other times, I shall lye with the men in a barn,\r\nwhich I doubt not will hearten them much. In every thing, as a\r\nvolunteer, I shall do all I can to advance the service; but am\r\ndetermined never to act as an officer. I have several things to say at\r\nmeeting. If you have occasion for tent or horses, they are at your\r\nservice, for I design to keep none, but make presents of them all.\r\n\r\n                                      \"Adieu! Yours, GEORGE MURRAY.\"\r\n\r\n\"Haroby, 15th Nov. 1745.\"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nNot only were the seeds of disunion thus sown between the Prince and the\r\nGenerals, but also between the Marquis of Tullibardine and Lord George\r\nMurray.\r\n\r\n\"I did expect,\" writes Lord George to the Marquis, \"that you would have\r\nupon occasion stood my friend; but I find you are too apt to hearken to\r\ndesigning people, by your being so ready to blame me before I was heard;\r\nand, except you show some regard for me, how can I expect it of others?\r\nI told his Royal Highness that you had acquainted me that he desired to\r\nsee me. He said, No, he had nothing particular to say to me. I told him\r\nI should be as ready to serve in a private station, and as a volunteer,\r\nin the first rank of your men, as ever I could be in any other. He said\r\nI might do so. Nothing else passed. I spoke a good time to Sir Thomas\r\nSheridan, and told him in particular, that if anything was taken amiss\r\nin my letter, as having expressed my attachment to the King, without\r\nhaving mentioned his Royal Highness, it was very injurious to me; for\r\nhaving mentioned the King and royal family, (and designing my letter to\r\nbe short,) I thought it needless to be more particular; for surely, next\r\nto the King, I would serve none on earth before his Royal Highness:\r\nwhich, after what I have shown, and all my actions since I joined the\r\nstandard, could not be called in question. I mentioned several\r\nparticulars, wherein I showed that I had no authority in the station I\r\nwas in, and that others acted as General who had not any call, but used\r\nhis Royal Highness's name. That in the drudgery, I was employed, but\r\nanything of moment was done without my participation. That, in short, I\r\nhad ventured my all--life, fortune, family--every thing, my honour;\r\nwhich last I had some to lose, but none to gain, in the way things were\r\nmanaged, and therefore resolved upon a private station.\"[85]\r\n\r\nThe concluding paragraph of this painful letter is written with a force\r\nand bitterness which show how deeply this ardent servant of a failing\r\ncause was wounded by what he justly deemed unmerited caprice and\r\ndisrespect. \"I wish you would be careful of the Atholl men, that they be\r\nnot slighted; which never should have happened as long as I had any\r\ncommand. I find scarce any of them have got even thanks for venturing\r\nlife and fortune, and even the gallows; and, which is worse, (I don't\r\nknow how it is come about,) they are not thought equally good with other\r\nmen. If you would send me the notes, that were made out, of the way of\r\nmodelling them into two different regiments, I would do, now that I have\r\ntime to do it, as much as possible for the good of the service and\r\ngeneral comfort. I always am, dear brother, your most faithful and\r\nhumble servant and affectionate brother,\r\n\r\n                                                \"GEORGE MURRAY.\"[86]\r\n\r\n\"Haroby, 16th Nov. 1745.\"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThere was also another source of complaint, which, though appearing on\r\nthe surface to have originated with the Duke of Perth, was clearly\r\ntraceable to the Prince, or rather to his adviser, Secretary Murray. A\r\nmarked slight had been passed on Lord George Murray on the very night on\r\nwhich the battery on Carlisle was opened. He had gone into the trenches;\r\nand, seeing the Duke of Perth there, he had desired him, in case of\r\nanything extraordinary happening, to let him know, and that he would aid\r\nhim by every means in his power. What private orders the Duke had was\r\nnot known; but, far from applying to Lord George for aid or counsel, he\r\nsent to Brampton, seven miles' distance, whenever any difficulty\r\noccurred, and acquainted the Prince with it, but took no notice of Lord\r\nGeorge, although he was an older officer than himself, and had been sent\r\nto Harroby to cover the siege. Upon this, Lord George, who thought he\r\nwas entitled to know what had passed in the trenches, complained, but\r\nreceived no satisfactory answer: and thus aggrieved, and, as he\r\nconceived, insulted, he sent that letter to the Prince, which has justly\r\nbeen censured as making an invidious distinction between the young\r\nChevalier and his father.[87]\r\n\r\nThese acts of indiscretion and intemperance were followed by another\r\nproceeding still less worthy of the soldier and the man of honour: Lord\r\nGeorge Murray indeed lowered himself, when, at the same time that he\r\nwrote to the Prince, he set on foot a petition praying Charles that he\r\nwould dismiss all Roman Catholics from his councils. This was aimed at\r\nthe Duke of Perth and Sir Thomas Sheridan; nor can we assign to it any\r\nbetter motive than that it was intended to re-instate Lord George Murray\r\nin the command. Some allowance may, nevertheless, be made for the\r\nprejudices of a Presbyterian, acting on the determined and overbearing\r\nnature of a high-spirited man. But the vital principles of our Christian\r\nfaith tend to soften animosities, to humble pride, and to accord to\r\nothers the same intention to act rightly as that of which we ourselves\r\nare prone to boast. A sincere, a truly pious member of the Christian\r\nchurch cannot be an intolerant partizan of certain modes of faith.\r\nThere dwells within his breast a deeper sentiment than that which is\r\ninspired by the worldly and sublunary distinctions of sect. And Lord\r\nGeorge Murray, seeing his young and blameless rival, the Duke of Perth,\r\nbrave, honourable, and moderate, had shown greater zeal for true\r\nreligion had he not availed himself of an unworthy plea to base upon it\r\nan invidious and covert insinuation.\r\n\r\nHe was reproved by the magnanimity of the man whom he desired to remove\r\nfrom the Prince's councils. Although the Duke of Perth did not profess\r\nto acquiesce in the opinion that it was unreasonable that he should have\r\nthe chief command, although he did not pretend to acknowledge the\r\njustice of the claim, he nobly gave up, for the sake of a Prince whom he\r\nloved, the superiority to Lord George Murray. His conduct on this\r\noccasion recalls the generous sentiments of the knight and soldier in\r\nancient times; unhappily it failed in producing that unanimity which it\r\nwas intended to effect. The rancour between Lord George Murray and the\r\nSecretary still remained, although it did not break out on every\r\noccasion, and sometimes gave way to the common cause when the interests\r\nof all were at stake.[88]\r\n\r\nAt Carlisle the forces were reviewed and were found to amount to above\r\nfive thousand foot, with five hundred[89] on horseback, mostly\r\nlow-country gentlemen followed by their servants, under the name of\r\nguards, hussars, &c.[90] After a few days rest, and after completing\r\nevery arrangement for the preservation of Carlisle, the army marched to\r\nPenrith; Lord George preceding the rest of the forces at the head of six\r\nregiments and some horse. This was an adventurous undertaking with so\r\nsmall a force; for there were now in England above sixty thousand men in\r\narms including the militia and the newly raised regiments; but the\r\nPrince, observes Mr. Maxwell, \"had hitherto had a wonderful run of\r\nsuccess.\" He was still buoyed up with hopes of a landing of French\r\ntroops, and of an insurrection in his favour.[91]\r\n\r\nOn the twenty-fourth of November the Prince marched from Carlisle to\r\nPenrith, and thence to Lancaster, which he reached on the twenty-fifth,\r\nat the head of the vanguard of his army. He was dressed in a light plaid\r\nbelt, with a blue sash, a blue bonnet on his head, decorated with a\r\nwhite rose, the sound of the bagpipes, and the drum playing \"The King\r\nshall have his own again;\" the banners, on which were inscribed the\r\nwords \"Liberty and Property, Church and King,\" failed, nevertheless, to\r\ninspire the cold spectators who beheld them with a corresponding\r\nenthusiasm.\r\n\r\nThe army advanced towards Preston, Lord George Murray commanding the\r\nvan; and on the twenty-sixth of November, the whole force assembled\r\nbefore that town, the very name of which struck terror into Scottish\r\nbreasts. Nor were the English Jacobites without their fears, nor devoid\r\nof associations with the name of a place in which the hopes of their\r\nparty had been blighted in 1715, and their banners steeped in blood.\r\nThe walls of Preston recalled to many of the volunteers of Lancashire\r\nthe prison in which their fathers had died of fever, or starvation, or\r\nof broken hearts. It is remarkable, as one of the newspapers of the day\r\nobserves, that many of those who joined the Chevalier's ranks were the\r\nsons of former insurgents. \"Hanging,\" adds the coarse party writer, \"is\r\nhereditary in some families.\"[92] Lord George Murray, in order to avoid\r\nthe \"freit,\" or, in other words, to humour the superstition of the\r\nHighlanders, who had a notion that they never should get beyond Preston,\r\ncrossed the Ribble bridge, and landed a great many of his men on the\r\nother side of the water, about a mile from the town, where they halted\r\nthe next day, waiting for some intelligence, of which it is presumed,\r\nsays Lockhart, \"they were disappointed.\" Here it was necessary to divide\r\neven this little army for the convenience of quarters.[93] At Preston\r\nthe Prince was received with enthusiastic cheers, but when officers were\r\nordered to beat up for recruits, no one enlisted. The tents which had\r\nbeen provided had been left on the road from Moffat to Edinburgh; and\r\nthe season was so severe, that it was impossible even for Highlanders to\r\nsleep in them; the town was too small to receive them; the same\r\narrangement that had been begun at Carlisle was still pursued, and the\r\narmy went in two great divisions, though with scarcely a day's march\r\nbetween them. Lord George Murray commanded what was called the\r\nlow-country regiments; but the greater part of these was, observes Mr.\r\nMaxwell, \"Highlanders by their language, and all were in their dress,\r\nfor the Highland garb was the uniform of the whole army.\"\r\n\r\nOne can easily conceive what must have been the effect of this gallant\r\nforce, unbroken by fatigue or privation, and glorying in their\r\nenterprise, as they entered into the friendly county of Lancaster,\r\nfilled with Roman Catholic gentry, who gathered around the standard of\r\nthe Prince. The colours of the Tartan, which was worn, as we have seen,\r\nby the whole of the army, both Highlanders and Lowlanders, although\r\ndenominated by a writer in the _Scots' Magazine_ as a \"vulgar glare,\"\r\nnever offend the eye, but are, according to a high authority,\r\n\"beautifully blended and arranged.\" \"Great art,\" observed the celebrated\r\nMr. West, \"(that is to say, much knowledge of the principles of\r\ncolouring with pleasing effect,) has been displayed in the composition\r\nof the tartans of several Clans, regarding them in general as specimens\r\nof national taste, something analogous to the affecting but artless\r\nstrains of the native music of Scotland.\"\r\n\r\nThis garb, which excited the attention and admiration of Napoleon at the\r\nbattle of Waterloo, consisted of the truis, the kilted plaid, and\r\nphilibeg. The truis, be it observed, for the benefit of the dwellers in\r\nthe south, were used by gentlemen on horseback, and by others according\r\nto their choice; but the common garb of the people was the plaid and\r\nkilt; and this was the usual dress down to the passing of the act for\r\nsuppressing the garb. The tartan is said to have been known in Flanders;\r\nand the tartan and kilt to have been adopted in the Lowlands before\r\ntheir adoption among the mountains.[94] Without attempting to meddle in\r\nthe dangerous and intricate question of antiquity, it must be\r\nacknowledged that the Highland dress is well adapted to the habits of a\r\npastoral people, as well as being extremely graceful and picturesque. It\r\nis also admirably fitted to oppose the inclemency of those regions in\r\nwhich, among the other habits which characterise the peculiar people who\r\nwear it, it is still regarded as a loved and revered badge of national\r\ndistinction. In the various campaigns in Holland, the Highlanders\r\nsuffered far less than other nations in that damp and chilly climate; in\r\nthe retreat to Corunna, under the hero Sir John Moore, their plaids\r\nbound lightly round their bodies, they experienced the convenience of\r\nthat simple form of dress in a rapid and protracted march. Light and\r\nfree, the mountaineer could pursue, without restraint, the most\r\nlaborious occupations; he could traverse the glens, or ascend mountains\r\nwhich offer a hopeless aspect to the inhabitants of more civilized\r\nspheres. But it was not only as a convenient and durable mode of apparel\r\nthat the kilt and philibeg were advantageous. The Highland costume, when\r\nit formed a feature among English or foreign regiments, cemented a\r\nspirit which was felt and feared by foes. It bound those who wore it in\r\na common bond, not to dishonour the garb which their chiefs and their\r\nforefathers had worn, by an act of cowardice, or by deeds of\r\ncruelty.[95]\r\n\r\nLittle did the English Government, or the inhabitants of the metropolis,\r\nor probably the country in general, know the character of the brave,\r\nill-fated band of Highlanders, who were now advancing into the very\r\nheart of the country. It was the custom, especially among those who\r\nwished to gain preferment at Court, or who affected to be fashionable,\r\nto speak of the Highlanders as low, ignorant savages; semi-barbarians,\r\nto whom the vulgar qualities of personal courage and hardihood might be\r\nallowed, but who had neither any urbanity to strangers, nor refined\r\nnotions of honour. The word \"rebel,\" was a mild name for those who were\r\nfollowing Prince Charles's standard as it was borne southwards. The\r\nhardened villains, \"the desperadoes, rabble, thieves, banditti!\"[96] are\r\nthe terms usually employed in expressing the sovereign contempt felt by\r\nignorance for an honourable, religious, and primitive people. It seems\r\nalso to have been thought only necessary for the Duke of Cumberland to\r\nshow his face in the north, to put to flight a beggarly handful of\r\nundisciplined men, whose moral character, if we might credit certain\r\npassages in the Magazines of the day, was as low as their military\r\nacquirements. By other nations besides their own sister country, the\r\nsame erroneous notions concerning the Scottish Highlanders prevailed. In\r\nGermany it was conceded that they might be capable of becoming \"good and\r\nuseful subjects when converted from heathenism.\" The French, too,\r\npresumed to look upon them with contempt, until they met them, when\r\nacting as auxiliaries to other powers, so often in battle, and beheld\r\nthem so generally in the front, that they verily believed at last, there\r\nwere twelve battalions in the army instead of two; and one of their\r\nGenerals, Broglio, in after times remarked, that \"he had often wished to\r\nbe a man of six feet high, but that he became reconciled to his size\r\nafter he saw the wonders performed by the little mountaineers.\"[97]\r\n\r\nIt is scarcely now necessary to allude to these errors at that time\r\nprevalent regarding the valour of the Scottish host. Tributes from every\r\nknown country have long elevated this brave and oppressed people into a\r\nproud and honourable position. Instead, however, of the undisciplined\r\nsavages who were supposed to be traversing the country, it was sooner\r\nfound than acknowledged, that the intrepidity of the Highlanders was\r\nunited to humanity, and to upright principles. To their noble qualities\r\nwas added a deep sense of religion. In after-times it was remarked, that\r\nno trait in the character of the Highlanders was more remarkable than\r\nthe respect which was paid by the different regiments which were\r\neventually employed in the British service, to their chaplains. The men\r\nwhen they got into any little scrape were far more anxious, writes\r\nGeneral Stuart, \"to conceal it from their chaplain than from their\r\ncommanding officer.\"\r\n\r\nBut, however the public prints might revile, and the polite society at\r\nSt. James's ridicule, and misunderstand the Highlanders, the General\r\nwhose lot it was to conquer the unfortunate Jacobites knew well of what\r\nmaterials their forces were composed. The Duke of Cumberland, at the\r\nbattle of Fontenoy, had been so much pleased with the conduct of the\r\nfamous Black Watch, that he had offered them any favour which they chose\r\nto ask, or which he could grant, to mark his approbation. The answer to\r\nthis proof of approbation was worthy of those valiant auxiliaries, who\r\nare described by the French as \"Highland furies, who rushed in upon us\r\nwith more fury than ever did a sea driven by a tempest.\" The Highlanders\r\nreplied, after thanking the Royal Duke for his courtesy, \"that no favour\r\nhe could bestow on them would gratify them so much as to pardon a\r\nsoldier of their regiment, who lay under a sentence of court martial, by\r\nwhich he was decreed to incur a heavy corporal punishment; the\r\ninfliction of which would,\" they said, \"bring dishonour on themselves,\r\ntheir friends, and their country.\" The request was granted. It was,\r\nnevertheless, the countrymen of these Highlanders, men as heroic as\r\ntrue, as nice in their sense of honour as the Black Watch, upon whom the\r\nDuke wreaked the utmost of his vengeance after Culloden, whom he hunted\r\nwith bloodhounds,--whose honest hearts he broke by every possible\r\nindignity, though their gallant spirits could never be subdued.\r\n\r\nAs the army advanced, a great multitude assembled to gaze upon the\r\nsingular spectacle. The very arms borne by the Highlanders were objects\r\nof curiosity and surprise, no less than of alarm, to the populace, who\r\nstood by the way-side expressing their good-will to the expedition, but\r\nwho, when asked to join the insurgents, declined, saying, \"they did not\r\nunderstand fighting.\"[98] The formidable weapons with which the\r\nHighlanders contrived to make themselves terrible to their enemies,\r\nconsisted of a broad-sword, girded on the left side, and a dirk or short\r\nthick dagger on the right, used only when the combat was so close as to\r\nrender the broadsword useless. In ancient times, these fierce warriors\r\nbrandished a small short-handled hatchet or axe, for the purpose of a\r\nclose fight. A gun, a pair of pistols, and a target, completed their\r\narmour, except when ammunition failed, when they substituted for the\r\ngun, the lochaber axe; this was a species of long lance, or pike, with a\r\nformidable weapon at the end of it, adapted either for cutting or\r\nstabbing. The lochaber axe had fallen into disuse since the introduction\r\nof the musket; but a rude, yet ready substitute had been found for it,\r\nby fixing scythes at the end of a pole, with which the Highlanders\r\nresisted the attacks of cavalry. Such had been their arms in the early\r\npart of the Insurrection of 1745, and such they continued until, at the\r\nbattles of Falkirk and Preston Pans, they had collected muskets from the\r\nslain on the battle-field. In addition to these weapons, the gentlemen\r\nsometimes wore suits of armour and coats of mail; in which, indeed, some\r\nof the principal Jacobites have been depicted; but, with these, the\r\ncommon men never incumbered themselves, both on account of the expense,\r\nand of the weight, which was ill-adapted to their long marches and steep\r\nhills.[99]\r\n\r\nA distinguishing mark which the Highland Clans generally adopted, was\r\nthe badge. This was frequently a piece of evergreen, worn on the bonnet,\r\nand placed, during the insurrection of 1745, beside the white cockade.\r\nWhen Lord Lovat's men assembled near the Aird, they wore, according to\r\nthe evidence given on the State Trials, sprigs of yew in their\r\nbonnets.[100] These badges, although generally considered to have been\r\npeculiar to the clans, were, observes a modern writer,[101] \"like\r\narmorial bearings, common to all countries in the middle ages; and\r\nshared by the Highlanders among the general distinctions of chivalry,\r\nwere only peculiar to them when disused by others.\" Thus, the broom worn\r\nby Geoffrey Plantagenet, Count D'Anjou;--and the raspberry by Francis\r\nthe First of France, were only discontinued as an ornament to the head\r\nwhen transferred to the habit, or housings; but the Highland Clans,\r\ntenacious of their customs, wore the plant not only upon their caps, but\r\nplaced them on the head of the Clan standard. The white cockade was now\r\nregarded as the peculiar badge of the party; yet it seems not, at all\r\nevents among the Clan Fraser, to have superseded the evergreen. Some few\r\ntraces are left, in the present day, to certify, nevertheless, that they\r\nwere worn during the contest of 1745. \"Lord Hardwicke's Act, and\r\ncontinual emigration,\" remarks John Sobieski Stuart, \"have extirpated\r\nthe memory of these distinctions once as familiar as the names of those\r\nwho bore them; and all of whom I have been able to collect any evidence\r\nare, the Macdonalds, the Macphersons, the Grants, the Frasers, the\r\nStuarts, and the Campbells.\" \"The memory of most,\" mournfully remarks\r\nthe same writer, \"has now perished among the people; but, within a\r\nrecent period, various lists have been composed--some by zealous\r\nenthusiasts, who preferred substitution to loss, and some by the\r\npurveyors of the carpet Highlanders, who once a-year illuminate the\r\nsplendour of a ball-room with the untarnished broadswords and silken\r\nhose, never dimmed in the mist of a hill, or sullied in the dew of the\r\nheather.\"[102]\r\n\r\nThe Macdonalds, until a very short period before the rebellion of 1715,\r\nwere known by the heather bow. \"Let every man,\" said one of their chiefs\r\nof old, looking round on a field of blooming heather, \"put over his head\r\nthat which is under his feet.\" The destined sufferers of Glenco were\r\nmarked by their \"having a fair busk of heather, well spread and\r\ndisplayed over the head of a staff.\" The Clan Macgregor wore the fir;\r\nand the Clan Grant assumed a similar badge; whilst the badge of the\r\nFrasers is said to have been supplied for ages by a yew of vast size, in\r\nGlen-dubh, at the head of Strath Fearg. The badge assigned to the\r\nMacphersons was the water lily, which abounds in the Lochs of Hamkai,\r\nupon the margin of which was the gathering place of the Clan Chattan.\r\nSome of these distinctions appear to have been used during the year\r\n1745, as we see in the case of the Frasers, but all to have emerged into\r\nthe one general distinction of the Jacobites, the white rose, first worn\r\nby David the Second, at the tournament of Windsor in 1349, when he\r\ncarried the \"_Rose argent_.\" This badge had been almost forgotten in\r\nScotland, until the year 1715, when it was worn by the adherents of\r\nJames Stuart, on his birthday, the tenth of June. \"By the Irish\r\nCatholics,\" observes the Editor of the \"Vestiarium Scoticum,\" \"it is\r\nstill worn on the same day; but in Scotland its memory is only retained\r\nin the ballads of '15, and '45.\"\r\n\r\nThe Muses, who, as Burns has remarked, are all Jacobites, have\r\ncelebrated this badge in these terms:--\r\n\r\n    \"O' a' the days are in the year,\r\n    The tenth o' June I lo' maist dear,\r\n    When our _white roses_ a' appear,\r\n    For the sake o' Jamie the Rover.\"[103]\r\n\r\nThe Highland host, after marching through Preston, to the sounds of the\r\nbagpipes, which played \"The King shall have his own again,\" took the\r\nroad through Wigan, towards Manchester. The Prince was informed that the\r\nEnglish troops had broken down the bridge at Warrington; and that\r\ncircumstance, which decided him to go through Wigan, somewhat encouraged\r\nhis naturally sanguine temper, as it showed fear on the part of the\r\nenemy. During this march, the kind-hearted young man went on foot,\r\nexcept occasionally, when we find notice of his riding a fine horse in\r\nthe public prints of the day. He usually, however, gave up his carriage\r\nto the venerable Lord Pitsligo, and marched at the head of one of the\r\ncolumns. He never took dinner, but ate a hearty supper; and then,\r\nthrowing himself upon a bed, slept until four in the morning, when he\r\narose, to prosecute the fatigues of another day, fatigues which youth, a\r\nsound constitution, and, above all, a great degree of mental energy,\r\nenabled him to endure.\r\n\r\nWigan, which the Chevalier's forces now approached, had been, in the\r\ntime of Queen Elizabeth, agitated by religious differences; and the\r\nQueen's Commission for promoting the ordinances of the Reformed Church\r\nhad been there met with a vigorous resistance. During the civil wars,\r\nthis town, both from its vicinity to Latham House, and from its\r\nattachment to Charles the First, took a distinguished part, and obtained\r\nthe characteristic designation of the \"faithful and loyal town of\r\nWigan.\" After the insurrection of 1715, the oaths of supremacy and\r\nallegiance to the reigning family had been, in vain, strongly urged upon\r\nthe inhabitants of Lancashire, and a large mass of landed estates were,\r\nin consequence, put in jeopardy; although it does not appear that the\r\nowners were dispossessed of their estates, or that any other use was\r\nmade of the register taken of all the landed properties in the county,\r\nexcept to assist the magistrates in the suppression of the insurrection\r\nin the north. Nevertheless, the expectation which Charles might\r\nnaturally entertain of a general rising in Lancashire was not realized.\r\n\"Nothing,\" observes Mr. Maxwell, \"looked like a general concurrence\r\nuntil he came to Manchester.\"[104] This was remarkable, for Manchester\r\nhad been the head-quarters of many of the Parliamentary party in\r\nLancashire during the civil wars; whilst Preston and Wigan had both been\r\nroyalist boroughs. But a singular alteration had taken place in the\r\npeople of Manchester, who had changed from Roundheads to Jacobites.[105]\r\n\r\nDuring the whole of the preceding march the Highland army had levied\r\nthe public revenue with great accuracy; but no extortion, nor any\r\nattempts at plunder, had disgraced their cause, nor reflected on Lord\r\nGeorge Murray as their General.[106]\r\n\r\nAt Manchester, the first organized force raised in England for the\r\nChevalier joined Charles Edward. It was a regiment of two hundred men,\r\ncommanded by Colonel Townley, a gentleman who had been in the French\r\nservice; and was called the Manchester Regiment. It was composed of\r\nyoung men of the most reputable families in the town, of several\r\nsubstantial farmers and tradesmen, and of about one hundred common men.\r\nThe accession of this troop gave great encouragement to the Prince; yet\r\nthere were still many who thought very badly of the enterprise, and the\r\nadvice afterwards given by Lord George Murray at Derby, to retreat, was\r\nalso whispered at Manchester, Lord George being resolved to retreat,\r\nshould there be no insurrection in England, nor landing from France. \"At\r\nManchester, one of his friends told Lord George,\" relates Maxwell, \"that\r\nhe thought they had entered far enough into England, since neither of\r\nthese events had happened.\" To this Lord George replied that they might\r\nmake a farther trial, and proceed to Derby; where, if there should be no\r\ngreater encouragement to go on, he should propose a retreat to the\r\nPrince.[107]\r\n\r\nThe reception of Prince Charles at Manchester, was celebrated with\r\ndemonstrations of enthusiastic joy. As he marched on foot into the town,\r\nat the head of the clans, halting to proclaim the Chevalier St. George,\r\nKing, the bells rang, and preparations were made for illuminations and\r\nbonfires in the evening. The Prince was attended by twelve Scottish and\r\nEnglish noblemen: from these he was distinguished by wearing the white\r\ncockade on the top of his cap, in the centre, instead of on the side, as\r\ndid his general officers. Peculiarly formed to grace such occasions as a\r\ntriumphal entry into an important and friendly town, Charles Edward\r\nquickly won the good will of the female part of the community; and the\r\nbeauty and grace of the kingdom were soon, to use a phrase of a\r\ncontemporary writer, enlisted in his behalf.\r\n\r\nTo the personal attributes of the Prince, \"joining the good nature of\r\nthe Stuarts with the spirit of the Sobieski,\" Charles Edward added one\r\naccomplishment which the monarch then on the throne of England did not\r\npossess: he spoke English well, although with a foreign accent: in this\r\nlast respect, he resembled some of those around him, more especially the\r\nDuke of Perth, who, having been long abroad, in vain endeavoured to\r\nconceal the French idiom and pronunciation by affecting a broad Scottish\r\ndialect.[108]\r\n\r\nStill, in spite of these advantages, and notwithstanding the known\r\npredilection of the Lancastrians for the cause of the Stuarts, the\r\nlowest populace alone joined the standard of Charles. One melancholy,\r\nthough admirable exception has been already referred to in the person of\r\nColonel Francis Townley. This gentleman was a member of an ancient\r\nfamily, and the nephew of Mr. Townley, whose seat in Townley Hall,\r\nLancashire, lays claim to high antiquity; and yet, is modern in\r\ncomparison with a former residence, once seated on what is still called\r\nthe Castle Hill. Francis Townley was a man of literary acquirements,\r\nwhich, indeed, eminently distinguished his relative, the celebrated\r\nCharles Townley, who formed at Rome, and afterwards brought to London,\r\nthe well-known collection of marbles which was bought by the Trustees of\r\nthe British Museum for twenty thousand pounds; (supposed to be a sum far\r\nbeneath its actual value,) and which still graces that national\r\nstructure.\r\n\r\nThe family of Townley had been remarkable for their fidelity to the\r\nStuarts long before Colonel Francis Townley raised a troop for the\r\nChevalier. The grandfather of this unfortunate man, had been tried for\r\nrebellion, in 1715, but acquitted; it was therefore very unlikely that\r\nwhen his accomplished descendant espoused the same ill-starred cause,\r\nthere would be any mercy shown to a family so deeply implicated in\r\nJacobitism. Francis Townley was afterwards taken prisoner, and tried\r\nwith other persons, chiefly captains in the Manchester regiment. Of\r\nthese the greater number were hung on Kennington Common. The head of\r\nColonel Townley was severed from his body, according to sentence, after\r\ndeath, and was placed upon Temple Bar; but those of most of his brothers\r\nin arms were preserved in spirits, and sent into the country, to be\r\nplaced in public situations in Manchester and Carlisle.[109]\r\n\r\nPrince Charles now prepared to proceed on his march to Macclesfield,\r\nwhile Lord George Murray was sent with his division to Congleton. The\r\naccompaniments of the Jacobite army, if we can venture to believe a\r\nletter inserted in the Gentleman's Magazine for 1745, and purporting to\r\nbe written by a lady in Preston to her friend in London, formed a\r\nsingular spectacle. Four ladies of some distinction are stated in this\r\nletter to have marched with the army. These were Lady Ogilvie, Mrs.\r\nMurray of Broughton, a lady of great beauty and spirit, the celebrated\r\nJenny Cameron, and another female, unknown, but who is supposed to have\r\nbeen the mistress of Sir Thomas Sheridan. The populace, nevertheless,\r\nmistook Sheridan for a priest, and assigned to him the nick-name of the\r\n\"Archbishop of Canterbury.\" The first two ladies went in a chariot by\r\nthemselves; the others were in a coach and six with the young Chevalier,\r\nto whose dejection and weariness as he passed through Preston, Jenny\r\nCameron is said to have administered cordials. By the same writer the\r\nJacobite army are described as looking like \"hunted hares.\" Such is a\r\nspecimen of one of the ephemeral slanders of the day; and the\r\ncircumstance of the coach and six tends to disprove the whole letter.\r\nThe Prince, it is evident from every isolated account, marched on foot\r\nuntil he entered Derby.[110] It was, however, perfectly true that Mrs.\r\nMurray of Broughton and Lady Ogilvie, whose husbands were both with the\r\narmy, attended the movements of the Highland force.\r\n\r\nAnd now were the merits of Lord George Murray as a General, certain very\r\nsoon to be called into active play; for, on the twenty-sixth of\r\nNovember, William Augustus, Duke of Cumberland, had left London at the\r\nhead of an army, to oppose the insurgents.\r\n\r\nOn the character of the royal individual who, in his twenty-fifth year\r\ncame forward to rescue his country, as it was said, from the yoke of a\r\nforeign invader; and whose promising, but immature talents, backed by a\r\ngreat military force, were effectual in defeating the skill of an\r\nexperienced General, some reflections will naturally arise.\r\n\r\nWilliam, Duke of Cumberland, was born in the year 1721. He very early\r\ndemonstrated that predilection for military affairs which obtained for\r\nhim from Walpole the praise of having been \"one of the five only really\r\ngreat men whom he had ever seen.\" He very soon, also, betrayed that\r\ncruel and remorseless spirit which was wreaked on the brave and the\r\ndefenceless; that indifference to suffering which too aptly was repaid\r\nby an indignant people with the name of \"the Butcher;\"--that thirst for\r\nblood which we read of in Heathen countries, before the commandments of\r\nthe God of Israel, or the beautiful commentary of a Saviour of Mercy\r\nupon those sacred commandments, had chastened and humanized the people.\r\nThose tendencies which, whilst England was elate with success, and when\r\nshe gloried in a suppressed rebellion, raised the Duke of Cumberland to\r\na hero;--and, when reflection came, sank him to a brute; were manifested\r\nin the dawn of youth. In after years, (what extreme of odium could be\r\ngreater?)--even children instinctively feared him. One day, when playing\r\nwith his nephew, afterwards George the Third, a child, the Duke drew a\r\nsword to amuse him. The incident occurred long after the mouldering\r\nbones upon the field of Culloden were whitened in the sun; long after\r\nthe brave Balmerino had suffered, and vengeance had revelled in the doom\r\nof the beloved Kilmarnock. But the sins of the remorseless Cumberland\r\ncried to Heaven. They were registered in the mind of a child. The boy\r\nturned pale and trembled, and acknowledged that he thought his \"uncle\r\nCumberland was going to kill him.\" The Duke shocked and deeply hurt,\r\nreferred to popular prejudice the impression which was the result of\r\ncrime.\r\n\r\nImperious, aspiring, independent, the grasping and able intellect of the\r\nDuke soon imbibed a knowledge of affairs beyond his years. When scarcely\r\nout of the nursery he loved the council chamber, and delighted in the\r\nrecitals of foreign wars. As he reached manhood, he affected a lofty and\r\nphilosophical coldness; a dangerous attribute in youth, and one which\r\neither springs from a frigid disposition, or else infallibly contracts\r\nthe heart. But, in the case of the Duke of Cumberland, it concealed a\r\nproud and selfish spirit, which could ill brook the superiority of his\r\nelder brother, Frederic, Prince of Wales, or bear with temper the\r\npopularity of another. When, in after years, his brother's death was\r\ncommunicated to him, those jealous and disdainful feelings broke forth.\r\n\"It is a great blow to the country,\" he said, sarcastically; \"but I\r\nhope, in time, it will recover it.\" That want of faith in human nature,\r\nof reverence for good motives, that absence of a generous confidence\r\nwhich one can suppose strongly characterise the lost angels, were among\r\nthe many odious features in the character of this truly bad man. The\r\nprevailing feeling of his mind was, contempt for everything and\r\neverybody;--a contempt for renown;--a contempt, in after life, for\r\npolitics, which he conceived were below his attention; a contempt for\r\nwomen, whom he lowered by a sort of preference consistent with the rest\r\nof his coarse character, but whose modest virtues he mistrusted. With\r\nthis affectation of superiority, the Duke combined the littleness of\r\nenvy. When he had attained the height of his popularity, his\r\nsatisfaction was tarnished by the reputation of Admiral Vernon, who was\r\nthe idol of the public. As a General, his acknowledged and eminent\r\nqualities were sullied by the German puerilities of an exact attention\r\nto military trifles; any deficiency in etiquette was punished like a\r\ncrime: the formation of a new pattern of spatterdashes was treated as an\r\nimportant event. Nor was this all. He introduced into an army of\r\nEnglishmen the German notions of military severity; he fostered a system\r\nwhich it has taken nearly a century of great efforts, and good works in\r\nthe humane, to annul. \"He was,\" says Horace Walpole, \"a Draco in\r\nlegislation;\" adding, \"that in the Duke's amended mutiny bill the word\r\n'Death' occurred at every clause.\"[111]--Such is the general colouring\r\nof his public character. A strong and sensitive feeling with regard to\r\nthe national honour; a devoted reverence for the sovereign authority;\r\nwhich were the only principles and institutions which he seemed to\r\nrespect, are the milder traits. In private, he countenanced, by his own\r\npractice, most of those vices which scarcely existed with greater\r\nimpunity, or with less inconvenience from public opinion, in the days of\r\nCharles the Second, than in those in which Cumberland flourished, and\r\nleft a finished model of a character without one redeeming excellence.\r\n\r\nAs a soldier, however, the merits of the Duke, if merits those can be\r\ncalled which were the natural effects of animal courage, and of a\r\nstrong, remorseless mind, must be, at all events, acknowledged. He\r\nbehaved with great gallantry in his first campaign with his royal\r\nfather, and was wounded at the battle of Dettingen. At too early an age,\r\nin 1744, he was placed at the head of a great army, in order to oppose\r\nMarshal Saxe; and the event of the battle of Fontenoy proved the error.\r\nBut, in that engagement, the valour of the young General was admitted on\r\nall hands. \"His Royal Highness,\" relates the author of \"The Conduct of\r\nthe Officers at Fontenoy considered,\" \"was everywhere, and could not\r\nwithout being on the spot have cheered that Highlander who with his\r\nbroad sword killed nine men, and making a stroke at the tenth, had his\r\narm shot off,--by a promise of something better than the arm which he,\r\nthe Duke, saw drop from him.\"[112]\r\n\r\nIt was with the hope of retrieving the lost reputation of the Duke at\r\nFontenoy, and in order to remedy the glaring defects of General Hawley,\r\nthat this young man, old in hardened feelings, but full of ardour and\r\ncourage, was sent to repel the forces of the Chevalier. It was also\r\nthought by the Government that the placing a prince of the blood-royal\r\nat the head of the army would have a powerful influence on the minds of\r\nthe people, and neutralize the counter-influence of Charles Edward.[113]\r\nThe Duke therefore assumed the command of an army ten thousand strong,\r\nand set out from London to intimidate the enemy.\r\n\r\nThe Duke of Cumberland was by no means so ignorant of the force which he\r\nwas now destined to attack, as were most of the other \"good people of\r\nEngland, who knew as little of their neighbours of the Scottish\r\nmountains, as they did of the inhabitants of the most remote quarter of\r\nthe globe.\"[114] In the battle of Fontenoy, the Duke of Cumberland had\r\nbecome acquainted with the peculiar mode of fighting practised by the\r\nHighlanders, in the manoeuvre of the \"Black Watch,\" or 42nd; and had\r\nshown his judgment in allowing them to fight in their own way. This\r\ngallant regiment, in which many of the privates were gentlemen, were\r\nexempted at this time from the service of crushing the rebellion, only\r\nto have a duty, perhaps more cruel and more unwarrantable, forced upon\r\nthem, after the battle of Culloden. By a singular circumstance, the\r\nBlack Watch was commanded by Lord John Murray, a brother of Lord George\r\nMurray's, Sir Robert Munro officiating as acting colonel.[115]\r\n\r\nAt Macclesfield, Prince Charles gained the intelligence that the Duke of\r\nCumberland had taken the command of Ligonier's army, and that he was\r\nquartered at Lichfield, Coventry, Stafford, and Newcastle-under-Line.\r\nThe Prince then resolved to go direct to Derby; and it was to conceal\r\nhis design, and to induce the Duke to collect his whole army at\r\nLichfield, that Lord George Murray marched with a division of the army\r\nto Congleton, which was the road to Lichfield. Congleton, being on the\r\nborders of Staffordshire, was sufficiently near Newcastle-under-Line for\r\nLord George to send General Ker to that place to gain intelligence of\r\nthe enemy. General Ker advanced to a village about three miles from\r\nNewcastle, and very nearly surprised a body of dragoons, who had only\r\ntime to make off. He took one prisoner, a man named Weir, who was a\r\nnoted spy, and who had been at Edinburgh during the whole of the\r\nPrince's stay there, and had since always kept within one day's march of\r\nthe army. It was proposed to hang him; but Charles could not be brought\r\nto consent to the measure, and insisted that Weir was not, strictly\r\nspeaking, a spy, since he wore no disguise. \"I cannot tell,\" observes\r\nMr. Maxwell, \"whether the Prince on this occasion was guided by his\r\nopinion or by his inclination: I suspect the latter, because it was his\r\nconstant practice to spare his enemies when they were in his power. I\r\ndon't believe there was an instance to the contrary to be found in this\r\nexpedition.\"[116]\r\n\r\nUpon the third of December, Lord George Murray with his division of the\r\narmy marched by Leek to Ashbourn; and the Prince, with the rest of the\r\nforces, came from Macclesfield to Leek, where, considering the distance\r\nof the two columns of his army, and the neighbourhood of the enemy, he\r\nnaturally considered his situation as somewhat precarious. It was\r\npossible for the enemy, by a night-march, to get betwixt the two\r\ncolumns; and, contemplating this danger, the Prince set out at midnight\r\nto Ashbourn, where it was conceived that the forces should proceed in\r\none body towards Derby. \"Thus,\" remarks a modern historian, \"two armies\r\nin succession had been eluded by the Highlanders; that of Wade at\r\nNewcastle, in consequence of the weather or the old Marshal's\r\ninactivity, and that of Cumberland through the ingenuity of their own\r\nleaders.\"[117]\r\n\r\nCharles Edward and his officers slept at Ashbourn Hall, now in the\r\npossession of Sir William Boothby, Baronet; into whose family the estate\r\npassed in the time of Charles the Second.[118]\r\n\r\nThe young Prince had now advanced far into that county which has no\r\nrival in this Island in the beauty and diversity of its scenery, in the\r\nsimple, honest character of its fine peasantry, or in the rank and\r\ninfluence of its landed proprietors. The history of these families is\r\nconnected with the civil, and foreign wars of the kingdom; and already\r\nhad the moors and valleys of Derbyshire been the scene of contest which\r\nhad the Restoration of the Stuarts for their aim and end. In 1644, a\r\nbattle was fought near Ashbourn, in which the Royalists were defeated;\r\nin 1645, just a century before Charles Edward entered Ashbourn, Charles\r\nthe First had attended service in the beautiful gothic church of\r\nAshbourn, as he marched his army through the Peak towards Doncaster.\r\n\r\nThe inhabitants of the district retained some portion of their ancient\r\nloyalty to the Stuarts. As Prince Charles ascended the height, from\r\nwhich, leading towards Derby, a view of the town of Ashbourn, seated in\r\na deep valley, and of the adjacent and romantic country, may be seen,\r\nthe roads were lined with peasantry, decorated with white cockades, and\r\nshowing their sentiments by loud acclamations, bonfires, and other\r\nsimilar demonstrations. \"One would have thought,\" remarks Mr.\r\nMaxwell,[119] \"that the Prince was now at the crisis of his adventure;\r\nthat his fate, and the fate of the three kingdoms, must be decided in a\r\nfew days. The Duke of Cumberland was at Lichfield; General Wade, who was\r\nmoving up with his army along the west side of Yorkshire, was about this\r\ntime at Ferry Bridge, within two or three days' march. So that the\r\nPrince was, with a handful of brave, indeed, but undisciplined men,\r\nbetwixt two armies of regular troops, one of them above double, the\r\nother almost double, his number.\" It was owing to the skill and prudence\r\nof Lord George Murray that this gallant but trifling force was enabled\r\nto return to Scotland, for scarcely ever was there a handful of valiant\r\nmen placed in a situation of more imminent peril.\r\n\r\nDerby, which is fifteen miles from Ashbourn, was thrown into the utmost\r\nconfusion and disorder when the news that the vanguard of the insurgent\r\narmy was approaching it became generally known. \"The hurry,\" says a\r\ncontemporary writer, \"was much increased by the number of soldiers, and\r\ntheir immediate orders to march out of town, and nothing but distraction\r\nwas to be read in every countenance. The best part of the effects and\r\nvaluables had been sent away or secreted some days before, and most of\r\nthe principal gentlemen and tradesmen, with their wives and children,\r\nwere retiring as fast as possible.\"[120]\r\n\r\nThe borough of Derby, although by no means so opulent when Charles\r\nEdward and his friends visited it as in the present day, presented,\r\nperhaps, a far more appropriate scene for the faint and transient shadow\r\nof a Court, than it now affords. It had, even within the memory of man,\r\nan aspect singularly dignified, important, and antique in its streets;\r\nand it still possesses many residences which are adapted for the higher\r\norders, rather than for the industrious burgesses of a town. These are\r\nchiefly seated on the outside of the town. They were, so late as 1712,\r\nand perhaps much later, \"inhabited by persons of quality, and many\r\ncoaches were kept there.\" To the west, King's Mead, where formerly there\r\nwas a monastery of the Benedictine order, is now graced by a series of\r\nstately detached residences, which, under the modernized name of Nun's\r\nGreen, constitute the court end of Derby. But, interspersed in the\r\nstreets, there are still many ancient tenements in which Prince Charles\r\nand his high-born adherents might find suitable accommodation.\r\n\r\nParty feeling ran high in Derby, and most of its leading and principal\r\ndenizens were Tories, and even Jacobites. It was in Derby that Henry\r\nSacheverell preached his famous sermon, on \"Communication of Sin.\" This\r\nliterary firebrand was first thrown out to the High-Church party in\r\n1709, when the High Sheriff, George Sacheverell, of Callow, was attended\r\nby Dr. Henry Sacheverell as his chaplain, and the walls of All Saints\r\nChurch resounded with the denunciations of that vehement, and\r\nill-judging man. The seed that was thus sown fell into a land fertile in\r\nHigh Church propensities; the Grand Jury intreated Dr. Sacheverell to\r\nprint his discourse; and, eventually, when they considered that, by the\r\nmild sentence given against their Preacher on his trial, they had gained\r\na triumph, bonfires proclaimed their joy, in the market-place of that\r\ntown, where the warfare of Sacheverell had first begun.\r\n\r\nOn the accession of George the First, and when the Chevalier landed in\r\nScotland, fresh manifestations of the Jacobite party broke forth. The\r\nChurch of All Saints was again the scene of its display. Three principal\r\nclergymen in the town openly espoused the Stuart cause. Sturges, the\r\nRector of All Saints, prayed openly for \"King James\"--but, after a\r\nmoment's pause, said, \"I mean King George.\" \"The congregation became\r\ntumultuous; the military gentlemen drew their swords, and ordered him\r\nout of the pulpit, into which he never returned.\"[121] Perhaps the event\r\nwhich tended most to quiet the spirit of Jacobitism among the lower\r\nclasses in the town, was the erection of silk mills, in 1717. Nothing\r\ntranquillises extreme views in politics more surely than employment; few\r\nthings attach men's minds to a Government more, than efforts crowned\r\nwith success. Notwithstanding the memory of Sacheverell, a Whig member\r\nhad been returned, in the last election, for the borough; the great\r\nmerits and influence of the House of Cavendish overpowering the\r\nuproarious Tories, who, in vain, broke windows, and attacked their\r\nenemies. But discontent again broke forth. The winter of 1745 found the\r\nwhole nation in a state of suffering and discontent; and many of the\r\nconstitutional securities for liberty and property had been given up, in\r\norder to secure the stability of the throne. Taxation had been imposed,\r\nin the worst and most unpopular form, that of excise duties, in order to\r\nmaintain an expensive Court, and to pay for Continental wars, which were\r\nmaintained to preserve the hereditary German possessions of the King.\r\nYet, in spite of these crying evils, such is the difficulty of inducing\r\nEnglishmen to incur the risk of forfeiture and disaster, that even the\r\ntown of Derby had diligently provided itself with a defence against the\r\nChevalier's divided forces, on hearing of their approach.\r\n\r\nDuring the month of September 1745, in consequence of instructions from\r\nLondon, the Duke of Devonshire, attended by the greatest appearance of\r\ngentlemen ever seen in the town before, assembled the clergy, in order\r\nto consider of such measures as were necessary for the support of the\r\nGovernment. An association was entered into, and sums were liberally\r\ncontributed, after a splendid dinner, at that ungrateful inn, the\r\nGeorge, which, during the sojourn of Charles Edward at Derby, changed\r\nits sign, into the safe and ambiguous title of the King's Head. Two\r\ncompanies of volunteers, of six hundred men each, were raised by the\r\nassociation. A proposal to call out the county militia was vehemently\r\nnegatived, probably from that spirit of distrust which pervaded the\r\ncouncils of King George's Government. By an order in council, passed in\r\nthe previous September, all Roman Catholics had been prohibited from\r\nkeeping a horse of above five pounds in value, and restrained from going\r\nfive miles from their dwellings. It was, therefore, deemed advisable to\r\nselect the volunteer forces from the well-affected, and not to employ\r\nthe militia of a county so manifestly disposed to foster the young\r\nadventurer as Derbyshire was at that time considered. During the month\r\nof November, a great degree of alarm had disturbed the burgesses of\r\nDerby; and from the communications of the Duke of Devonshire, then\r\nLord-Lieutenant of the county, to the Mayor, it appears that the young\r\nChevalier completely baffled the Duke of Cumberland and General Wade,\r\nby his rapid movement into the very heart of England.[122]\r\n\r\nSo late as the twelfth of December, the Duke of Devonshire and his\r\neldest son, the Marquis of Hartington, were stationed at the George Inn,\r\nto watch the event of the coming storm, and to concert means for\r\naverting the threatened danger. Some days previously, the Duke had\r\nreviewed a company of six hundred volunteers, together with one hundred\r\nand twenty men raised at his own expense; and those townsmen, who were\r\nnot Jacobites, were in high spirits, concluding that the Duke of\r\nCumberland must have overtaken and attacked the insurgents. On the\r\nevening of the twelfth, the soldiers were summoned to the market-place,\r\nwhere they stood for some hours; they were then sent to quarters to\r\nrefresh themselves; about ten the drums beat to arms, and, being again\r\ndrawn out, these valiant defenders of the Borough marched out of the\r\ntown, by torch-light, towards Nottingham, headed by the Duke of\r\nDevonshire.\r\n\r\nOn the following morning, about eleven, two of the vanguard of the\r\ninsurgent army rode into the town; and, after seizing a very good horse,\r\nbelonging to a Mr. Stamford, went to the George Inn, and there inquiring\r\nfor the magistrates, they demanded billets for nine thousand men, or\r\nmore.\r\n\r\nIn a short time afterwards, the vanguard itself rode into the town; this\r\ndetachment consisted of about thirty men; they are described in the\r\naccount of a cotemporary writer, probably an eye witness, as \"likely\r\nmen,\" making a good appearance, in blue regimentals faced with red, with\r\nscarlet waistcoats trimmed with gold lace. They posted themselves in the\r\nMarket-place, where they rested for two or three hours; at the same time\r\nbells were rung, and bonfires made upon the pretext of \"preventing any\r\nresentment\" from the rebels that might ensue upon a cold reception.\r\nAbout midday, Lord George Murray, Lord Elcho, and several other chiefs\r\narrived, with troops to the number of one hundred and fifty, the flower\r\nof the army, who made \"a fine show.\" Soon afterwards the main body\r\nmarched into the town in tolerable order, six or eight abreast, with\r\nabout eight standards, most of them having a white flag with a red\r\ncross. But the appearance of the main body was totally different to that\r\nof the vanguard, and justified the contemptuous opinion and expectations\r\nformed by the loyal inhabitants of Derby, of their coming foe. As they\r\nmarched along, the sound of their bagpipes was heard, for the first\r\ntime, in the crowded and ancient streets of the borough; but the dress\r\nand bearing of these brave, but ill-accoutred men excited the derision\r\nof the thriving population of an important country town. They were, says\r\nthe writer in the _Derby Mercury_ of the day, \"a parcel of shabby,\r\npitiful looking fellows, mixed up with old men and boys, dressed in\r\ndirty plaids, and as dirty shirts, without breeches, and wore their\r\nstockings, made of plaid, not half way up their legs, and some without\r\ntheir shoes, or next to none, and numbers of them so fatigued with their\r\nlong march, that they really commanded our pity more than our\r\nfear.\"[123]\r\n\r\nAbout five in the evening, when it was nearly dark, the Prince, with the\r\nother column, arrived. He walked on foot, attended by a great body of\r\nmen, to a house appointed for his reception, belonging to Lord Exeter,\r\nand seated in Full-street. Here guards were placed around the temporary\r\nabode of the Prince; and here, during his stay at Derby, he held his\r\ncouncils.\r\n\r\n\"Every house,\" adds the writer before quoted, \"was pretty well filled\r\n(though they kept driving in till ten or eleven at night), and we\r\nthought we should never have seen the last of them. The Duke of Atholl\r\nhad his lodgings at Thomas Gisborne's, Esq.; the Duke of Perth at Mr.\r\nRivett's; Lord Elcho at Mr. Storer's; Lord Pitsligo at Mr. Meynell's;\r\nLord George Murray at Mr. Heathcote's; Old Gordon, of Glenbucket, at Mr.\r\nAlderman Smith's; Lord Nairn at Mr. John Bingham's; Lady Ogilvie, Mrs.\r\nMurray, and some other persons of distinction at Mr. Francey's; and\r\ntheir chiefs and great officers were lodged in the best gentlemen's\r\nhouses.[124] Many ordinary houses both public and private, had forty or\r\nfifty men each, and some gentlemen near one hundred.\"\r\n\r\nThe Prince, upon his arrival at Derby, resolved to halt for one day, and\r\nto take the advice of his council what was to be done at this juncture.\r\nHis hopes were high, and his confidence in the good-will of the people\r\nof England to his cause was unabated. He continued to entertain the\r\nnotion that George the Second was an usurper, for whom no man would\r\nwillingly draw his sword; that \"the people of England, as was their\r\nduty, still nourished that allegiance for the race of their native\r\nPrinces which they were bound to hold sacred, and that if he did but\r\npersevere in his daring attempt, Heaven itself would fight in his\r\ncause.\" His conversation, when at table, beneath the roof of Exeter\r\nHouse, turned on the discussion \"how he should enter London, whether on\r\nfoot, or on horseback, or whether in Highland or in Lowland garb.\"[125]\r\nNor was Charles Edward singular in his sanguine state of mind. It was\r\nobserved, says Mr. Maxwell, \"that the army never was in better spirits\r\nthan while at Derby.\"[126]\r\n\r\nThe judgment which Lord George Murray had formed at Manchester,\r\nremained, however, unaltered by all these expectations. On the following\r\nmorning, when the council met, he represented to the Prince that they\r\nhad marched so far into the country, depending on French succours, or on\r\nan insurrection, neither of which had taken place; that the Prince's\r\narmy, by itself, was wholly unprepared to face the troops which the\r\n\"Elector of Hanover,\" as Lord George denominated him, had assembled.\r\nBesides General Wade's army, which was coming to oppose them, and that\r\nof the Duke of Cumberland, forming together a force of between seventeen\r\nand eighteen thousand strong, there was a third army, encamped on\r\nFinchley Common, of which George the Second was going to take the\r\ncommand in person. Even supposing that the Prince should be successful\r\nin an engagement with one of these armies, \"he might be undone by a\r\nvictory.\" The loss of one thousand or fifteen hundred men would\r\nincapacitate the rest of his small force from another encounter; and\r\nsupposing that he was routed in that country, he and all his friends\r\nmust unavoidably be killed. On the whole, including the army formed at\r\nLondon, there would be a force of thirty thousand men to oppose an army\r\nof five thousand fighting men; that before such a host, pursued Lord\r\nGeorge,[127] \"it could not be supposed one man could escape; for the\r\nmilitia, who had not appeared much against us hitherto, would, upon our\r\ndefeat, possess all the roads, and the enemy's horse would surround us\r\non all hands; that the whole world would blame us as being rash and\r\nfoolish, to venture a thing that could not succeed, and the Prince's\r\nperson, should he escape being killed in the battle, must fall into the\r\nenemy's hands.\"\r\n\r\n\"His Royal Highness,\" continues Lord George Murray in his narrative,\r\n\"had no regard to his own danger, but pressed with all the force of\r\nargument to go forward. He did not doubt but the justness of his cause\r\nwould prevail, and he could not think of retreating after coming so far;\r\nand he was hopeful there might be a defection in the enemy's army, and\r\nthat several would declare for him. He was so very bent on putting all\r\nto the risk, that the Duke of Perth was for it, since his Royal Highness\r\nwas. At last, he proposed going to Wales, instead of returning to\r\nCarlisle, but every other officer declared his opinion for a retreat,\r\nwhich some thought would be scarce practicable. I said all that I\r\nthought of to persuade the retreat, and, indeed, the arguments to me\r\nseemed unanswerable; and for the danger, though I owned an army upon a\r\nretreat did not fight with equal valour as when they advanced, yet, if\r\nthe thing were agreed to, I offered to make the retreat, and be always\r\nin the rear myself; and that each regiment would take it by turns till\r\nwe came to Carlisle; and that the army should march in such order, that\r\nif I were attacked, I might be supported as occasion required, and\r\nwithout stopping the army (except a very great body of the enemy should\r\nbe upon me), I would send aide-de-camps to desire such assistance as I\r\nshould judge the occasion would require; but that I really believed\r\nthere would be no great danger; for, as we were informed, the Duke of\r\nCumberland was at Stafford, and would in all appearance, that night or\r\nnext morning, be drawing near London to intercept us, so that if our\r\ndesign were not mentioned till next morning that it should be put in\r\nexecution, we would be got to Ashbourn before he could have certain\r\ninformation of our design to retreat.\"\r\n\r\nThe Prince, who was naturally bold and enterprising, and who had been\r\nhitherto successful in every thing, was indignant at this. Since he had\r\nset out from Edinburgh, he had never had a thought but of going on, and\r\nfighting everything in his way to London. He had the highest idea of the\r\nbravery of his own men, and a despicable opinion of his enemies, and\r\nhitherto with good reason; and he was confirmed in these notions by some\r\nof those that were nearest his person; these sycophants, more intent\r\nupon securing his favour than promoting his interest, \"were eternally\r\nsaying whatever they thought would please, and never hazarded a\r\ndisagreeable truth.\"[128]\r\n\r\nA connected narrative of the proceedings in council has been given by\r\nLord Elcho; and, at the risk of some recapitulations, it is here\r\ninserted, not having been previously published entire.\r\n\r\n\"The fifth, in the morning, Lord George Murray, and all the commanders\r\nof battalions and squadrons, waited on the Prince, and Lord George told\r\nhim that it was the opinion of every body present that the Scots had now\r\ndone all that could be expected of them. That they had marched into the\r\nheart of England, ready to join any party that would declare for him.\r\nThat none had done so, and that the counties through which the army had\r\npassed had seemed much more enemies, than friends, to his cause. That\r\nthere were no French landed in England; and that if there was any party\r\nin England for him, it was very odd that they had never so much as\r\neither sent him money or intelligence, or the least advice what to do.\r\nBut if he could produce any letter from any person of distinction, in\r\nwhich there was an invitation for the army to go to London, or to any\r\nother part of England, that they were ready to go; but if nobody had\r\neither invited them, or meddled in the least in their affairs, it was to\r\nbe supposed that there was either no party at all, or, if there was,\r\nthey did not choose to act with them, or else they would ere now have\r\nlet him know it. Suppose even the army marched on and beat the Duke of\r\nCumberland, yet, in the battle they must lose some men; and they had,\r\nafter that, the king's own army, consisting of seven hundred men, near\r\nLondon to deal with. On the contrary, if either of these armies beat\r\nthem, there would not a man escape; as the militia, although they durst\r\nnever face the army while in a body, yet they would have courage enough\r\nto put an end to them if ever they were routed; and so the people that\r\nwere in armies in Scotland would fall an easy sacrifice to the fury of\r\nthe Government. Again, suppose the army was to slip the King's and\r\nDuke's army, and get into London, the success of the affair would\r\nentirely depend on the mob's declaring for or against it; and that if\r\nthe mob had been much inclined to his cause since his march into\r\nEngland, to be sure some of his friends in London would have fallen upon\r\nsome method to let him know it; but if the mob was against the affair,\r\nfour thousand five hundred men would not make a great figure in London.\r\nLord George concluded by saying, that the Scots army had done their\r\npart; that they came into England at the Prince's request, to join his\r\nEnglish friends, and to give them courage by their appearance to take\r\narms and declare for him publicly, as they had done, or to join the\r\nFrench if they had landed. But as none of these things had happened,\r\nthat certainly four thousand five hundred Scots had never thought of\r\nputting a king on the English throne by themselves. So he said his\r\nopinion was, they should go back and join their friends in Scotland, and\r\nlive and die with them.\r\n\r\n\"After Lord George had spoken, all the rest of the gentlemen present\r\nspoke their sentiments, and they all agreed with Lord George except two\r\n(the Duke of Perth and Sir William Gordon), who were for going to Wales\r\nto see if the Welsh would join.\r\n\r\n\"The Prince heard all these arguments with the greatest impatience, fell\r\ninto a passion, and gave most of the gentlemen that had spoke very\r\nabusive language; and said they had a mind to betray him. The case was,\r\nhe knew nothing about the country, nor had the smallest idea of the\r\nforce that was against him, nor how they were situated.\" Fully convinced\r\nthat the regular army would never dare to fight against him, and\r\ntrusting to the consciences of men more than to the broad sword of his\r\narmy, he always believed that he should enter St. James's with as little\r\ndifficulty as he had done Holyrood-house. \"He continued,\" says Lord\r\nElcho, \"all that day positive he would march to London. The Irish in the\r\narmy were always for what he was for, and were heard to say, that day,\r\n'that they knew if they escaped being killed, the worst that could\r\nhappen to them was a few months imprisonment.'\"\r\n\r\nThe reluctance of the unfortunate and brave young Chevalier was\r\nincreased by the evident ardour which his men, in the expectation of an\r\nengagement with the Duke of Cumberland, were at that very instant\r\ndisplaying, whilst the arguments which sealed Charles Edward's fate,\r\nresounded within the walls of Exeter-house. The Highlanders, whose\r\nheroism balanced the inequality of the respective forces, breathed\r\nnothing but a desire for the combat. They were to be seen, during all\r\nthat eventful day, in crowds before the shops of the cutlers,\r\nquarrelling who should be the first to get their swords sharpened.[129]\r\nIn the very midst of the discussions, a courier arrived from Lord John\r\nDrummond, informing the Prince that he had landed at Montrose with his\r\nregiment, the Scottish Brigade, newly raised in France, and some pickets\r\nof the Irish Brigade, the rest of which would probably be in Scotland\r\nbefore the letter reached the Prince.[130] But this favourable\r\nintelligence, far from lessening the desire of Lord George to secure a\r\nretreat, rather increased his determination to uphold that resolution;\r\nand emboldened him to unfold to Charles Edward a plan for a Scottish\r\ncampaign, which, he thought, might be prosecuted with advantage. In\r\nretreating to Scotland, the Prince, he argued, would have the advantage\r\nof retiring upon his reinforcements, which included the Highlanders at\r\nPerth, and the succours brought by Lord John Drummond. He concluded his\r\naddress by a request, in the name of the persons present, that they\r\nshould go back and join their friends in Scotland, to live or die with\r\ntheir countrymen.\r\n\r\nTwo councils were held upon this important subject, for in the afternoon\r\nthe Prince convened another, to consider of the advices which the\r\ncourier sent by Lord John Drummond had brought. \"The debates,\" observes\r\nthe Chevalier Johnstone, \"were very keen.\" The Prince obstinately\r\ninsisted upon giving battle to the Duke of Cumberland on the next day,\r\nthe sixth; but he stood alone in that opinion. The Chiefs of Clans, who,\r\nsince the council held at Perth, had never opposed the Prince in\r\nanything, feeling that they had now advanced too far to retreat,\r\nnevertheless opposed the march to London. They pointed to the coldness\r\nwith which the insurgent army had hitherto been received; and asked how,\r\nsupposing by some miracle the forces were to reach London, an army of\r\nfour thousand men would appear among a population of a million people?\r\nThe Prince still insisted upon marching to London; he even opposed the\r\nretreat, on the ground of the immense risk. The Duke of Cumberland, he\r\ncontended, would pursue them hotly, and be always at their heels.\r\nMarshal Wade, he remarked, would certainly receive orders to intercept\r\nthe army, so that they would \"be placed between two fires, and caught as\r\nit were, in a net.\"\r\n\r\nThis argument was met by the assurances which have been already stated\r\nin Lord George Murray's own language--that he would manage the retreat,\r\ntaking always the rear. That he ably and effectually fulfilled that\r\npromise, was shown in the result.\r\n\r\nAt length the Prince, finding the greater part of the council was of\r\nLord George's opinion, and deserted even by the Duke of Perth, who,\r\nafter for long time resting his head on the fire-place in silence,\r\naccorded loudly with the Clans, consented to the retreat. This assent,\r\nwrung from him, was given with these bitter words,--\"Rather than go\r\nback,\" exclaimed the high-spirited young man, \"I would wish to be twenty\r\nfeet under ground.[131] Henceforth,\" he added, haughtily, \"I will hold\r\nno more Councils, for I am accountable to no one for my actions, except\r\nto my father.\"\r\n\r\nThe usual double-dealing, and factious contention of party, succeeded\r\nthis painful scene in the council. \"After the council was dismissed,\"\r\nsays Mr. Maxwell,[132] \"some of those who had voted against the retreat,\r\nand the Secretary, who had spoken warmly for it in private conversation\r\nwith the Prince, condemned this resolution, and endeavoured to instil\r\nsome suspicion of the courage and fidelity of those who had promoted it.\r\nThe Prince was easily persuaded that he had been too complaisant in\r\nconsenting to a retreat, but would not retract the consent he had given,\r\nunless he could bring back those to whom he had given it over to his own\r\nsentiments; which he hoped he might be able to do, since the Secretary\r\nhad altered his opinion. With this view he called another meeting of the\r\nCouncil, in the evening, but found all the rest, to a man, firm in their\r\nformer sentiments; upon which, the Prince gave up a second time his own\r\nopinion and inclination, to the advice and desire of his Council.\"\r\n\r\nThe character of one individual was, however, elicited in this affair.\r\n\"From this time,\" observes Mr. Maxwell,[133] \"the Secretary ceased to be\r\nin odour of sanctity with those that were not highly prejudiced in his\r\nfavour. The little knave appeared plainly in his conduct on this\r\noccasion. He argued strenuously for the retreat, because he thought it\r\nthe only prudent measure, till he found it was carried by a great\r\nmajority, and would certainly take place; and then he condemned it, to\r\nmake his court to the Prince, to whom it was disagreeable, and lay the\r\nodium upon other people, particularly Lord George, whom he endeavoured\r\nto blacken on every occasion.\" Some people will wonder that this\r\nbare-faced conduct did not open the Prince's eyes as to the baseness of\r\nSecretary Murray's heart; \"but,\" says Maxwell, \"if we consider that\r\nMurray was in the highest degree of favour, the steps by which he rose\r\nto it, and the arts he used to maintain himself and exclude everybody\r\nthat could come in competition with him, he will easily conceive how he\r\ngot the better of any suspicions his behaviour might have created at\r\nthis time.\"\r\n\r\nThe question, whether the arguments of Lord George Murray were guided by\r\nwisdom, or whether they might be better characterised as the result of a\r\ncold, and, in this case, unworthy prudence, has been very differently\r\ncanvassed.\r\n\r\n\"There are not a few,\" observes Mr. Maxwell, \"who still think the Prince\r\nwould have carried his point had he gone on from Derby; they build much\r\nupon the confusion there was at London, and the panic which prevailed\r\namong the Elector's troops at this juncture.[134] It is impossible to\r\ndecide with any degree of certainty, whether he would or would not have\r\nsucceeded,--that depended upon the disposition of the Army and of the\r\nCity of London, ready to declare for the Prince. What could he do with\r\nfour thousand four hundred men, suppose he got to London, whatever were\r\nthe dispositions of the Army and the City? It is certain the Prince had\r\nno intelligence from either. This leads me to examine the conduct of the\r\nPrince's friends in England. The cry was general against them about this\r\ntime in the Prince's army, and they are still exclaimed against by\r\nforeigners, who, having but a very superficial knowledge of these\r\naffairs, conclude that either the English are all become Hanoverians,\r\nor, if there are still some that have an English heart, they must be\r\nstrangely degenerated, since they did not lay hold of this opportunity\r\nof shaking off the German yoke. Though I am convinced the Prince had a\r\ngreat many well-wishers in England, and though it is my opinion he would\r\nhave succeeded had they all declared for him, nevertheless I cannot join\r\nin the cry against them, no more than I can condemn abundance of his\r\nfriends in Scotland who did not join him. I have told elsewhere upon\r\nwhat a slender foundation this expedition was undertaken. Murray had\r\nimposed upon the Prince, and hurried him into it, without concerting\r\nanything with England. The English had always insisted upon a body of\r\nregular troops, not under seven and not above twelve thousand effective\r\nmen. They saw the Prince in England with a handful of militia, which\r\nthey could never think a match for thirty thousand regular troops. It is\r\ntrue the English have, in former times, taken arms upon less\r\nencouragement and less provocation than they had met with of late; but\r\nin those days the common people were accustomed to arms, and the\r\ninsurgents were as good soldiers as any that could be brought against\r\nthem.\"\r\n\r\nSuch is the reasoning of an eye-witness. One thing is certain,\r\ncontemporary writers appear to have generally acquiesced in the\r\npropriety of the retreat; and that circumstance constitutes the\r\nstrongest evidence in favour of the step. Yet, viewing events at this\r\ndistance of time, and taking into account the panic which seized, not\r\nonly the public mind, but which affected the heads of the Government on\r\nhearing of the bold and rapid march of the insurgents, our faith in the\r\nwisdom of a retreat is weakened. In the night when it was announced in\r\nthe fashionable circles of St. James's that the Prince had reached\r\nDerby, a general consternation was diffused throughout society. A lady\r\nof the highest rank, who was in one of the assemblies of the day,\r\nrelated to one of her descendants that upon the intelligence reaching\r\nthe party where she was, the rooms were instantly cleared, and on the\r\nfollowing morning there was not a carriage to be seen in London.\r\n\r\nNor were these apprehensions confined to any particular sphere.[135] The\r\narrival of the troops at Derby was known in London on the ninth of\r\nDecember, henceforth called by the English \"Black Monday.\" Many of the\r\ninhabitants fled in terror from the metropolis, taking their treasures\r\nwith them; the shops were closed: people thronged to the bank to obtain\r\npayment of its notes, and it only escaped bankruptcy by the following\r\nstratagem. Those who came first being entitled to priority of payment,\r\nthe managers of the bank took care to be surrounded by agents with\r\nnotes, to whom their pretended claims were paid in sixpences to gain\r\ntime. These agents went out by one door and came back by another, so\r\nthat the _bona fide_ holders of notes could never get near enough to\r\npresent them; and the bank stood out by these means until the panic had\r\ndied away. King George even embarked all his most precious effects on\r\nhis yachts, which were stationed in the Tower-quay, in readiness to\r\nconvey him away, should the dreaded Highlanders, as it now began to be\r\ngenerally expected, march to London in a few days. The \"moneyed\r\ncorporations,\" according to Smollett, were all in the deepest dejection;\r\nthey reflected that the Highlanders, of whom they had conceived a most\r\nterrible idea, were within four days' march of the capital; they\r\nanticipated a revolution ruinous to their own prosperity, and were\r\noverwhelmed with dismay.\r\n\r\n\"I was assured,\" writes the Chevalier Johnstone, (who differed from his\r\nGeneral, Lord George,) \"on good authority, when I was in London, some\r\ntime after our unfortunate defeat, that the Duke of Newcastle, then\r\nSecretary of State for the War Department, remained inaccessible in his\r\nown house the whole of the 6th of December, weighing in his mind the\r\npart which it would be most prudent for him to take, and even uncertain\r\nwhether he should not instantly declare himself for the Pretender. It\r\nwas even said at London, that fifty thousand men had actually left that\r\ncity to meet the Prince and join his army, and every body in the capital\r\nwas of opinion, that, if we had beaten the Duke of Cumberland, the army\r\nof Finchley Common would have dispersed of its own accord, and that by\r\nadvancing rapidly to London, we might have taken possession of that city\r\nwithout the least resistance from the inhabitants, and without\r\nexchanging a single shot with the soldiers. Thus a revolution would have\r\nbeen effected in England, so glorious for the few Scotchmen by whom it\r\nwas attempted, and altogether so surprising, that the world would not\r\nhave comprehended it. It is true, the English were altogether ignorant\r\nof the number of our army, from the care we took in our marches to\r\nconceal it; and it was almost impossible for their spies ever to\r\ndiscover it, as we generally arrived in the towns at nightfall, and left\r\nthem before the break of day. In all the English newspapers our numbers\r\nwere uniformly stated as high as twelve or fifteen thousand men. Under\r\nsuch circumstances, some temporary advantages might have been gained by\r\nmarching southwards; for it is now believed that the Jacobite party in\r\nEngland were much more numerous than we have generally understood; and\r\nthat thousands would have flocked to the standard of Charles Edward had\r\nhe been accompanied by a sufficient force to authorise the expectation\r\nof his success.\"\r\n\r\nThe British administration was, it is true, devoid of men of talent or\r\nprinciple, and discontent and distress prevailed in the country. In the\r\nCity of London, the Jacobite party was very strong; its member was\r\nAlderman Heathcote, who, with Sir Watkin Williams Wynn, had announced to\r\nLord Temple his determination to rise immediately upon a landing of\r\ntroops from France.[136] The prevalence of Jacobite principles among\r\nthe English gentry is supposed to have infected many officers in the\r\nroyal army, who might have avowed them at any crisis in the public\r\naffairs; many were, at all events, suspected of Jacobite principles;\r\n\"and the mere suspicion,\" remarks Lord Mahon, \"would have produced\r\nnearly the same effects as the reality,--bewilderment, distrust, and\r\nvacillation in the chiefs.\" \"Had, then, the Highlanders combined to push\r\nforward,\" observes this able writer, \"must not the increasing terror\r\nhave palsied all power of resistance? Would not the little army at\r\nFinchley, with so convenient a place for dispersing as the capital\r\nbehind it, have melted away at their approach?\"\r\n\r\nIn confirmation of this surmise may be quoted an anecdote which is\r\nrelated of a company of the celebrated Black Watch, which had been\r\nexempted during the insurrection of 1745 from serving against their\r\ncountrymen; more than three hundred of the regiment having brothers and\r\nrelations engaged in the Jacobite army.[137] But it was afterwards\r\nemployed on a service which might well have been assigned to others;--to\r\nexecute the decrees of burning, and to lay waste the districts where the\r\nforefathers of these brave men had lived. On marching one company of\r\nthis famous regiment out of London, the Highlanders, on arriving at\r\nHounslow, suddenly became immovable; they halted, and refused to\r\nproceed, or to bear arms against their countrymen. Their commanders, in\r\ndismay, turned to the chaplain of the regiment, to use his influence.\r\nThe clergyman then in office happened to be Ferguson, the celebrated\r\nastronomer. He mounted on a temporary rostrum or pulpit, harangued the\r\nHighlanders, and, after an emphatic address, prevailed on them to march\r\nforward.\r\n\r\nSuch were some of the difficulties which the English Government\r\nencountered. To this may be added, the defenceless state of the coasts\r\nof Kent and Essex. The French ministers were now in \"the very crisis of\r\ndecision as to their projected expedition.\" The preparations at Dunkirk\r\nwere completed; and had Charles Edward, by advancing, shown that such\r\naid was only a secondary matter in his favour, their fleet would have\r\nset sail. Besides, the Jacobites in England were by no means in so\r\napathetic and subdued a condition as that which has been generally\r\nrepresented.[138]\r\n\r\n\"I believe then,\" emphatically remarks Lord Mahon, \"that had Charles\r\nmarched onward from Derby he might have gained the British throne; but I\r\nam far from thinking that he would long have held it.\"\r\n\r\n\"Whether he (Charles Edward),\" says Sir Walter Scott, \"ought ever to\r\nhave entered England, at least without collecting all the forces which\r\nhe could command, is a very disputable point; but it was clear, that\r\nwhatever influence he might for a time possess, arose from the boldness\r\nof his advance. The charm, however, was broken the moment he showed, by\r\na movement in retreat, that he had undertaken an enterprise too\r\ndifficult for him to achieve.\"[139]\r\n\r\nIn the opinion of the Chevalier Johnstone, whose judgment was formed\r\nunder the influence of Lord George Murray, much of the failure of the\r\nexpedition was owing to the inactivity of Lord John Drummond, who ought,\r\naccording to his statement, to have advanced by forced marches to the\r\nassistance of Prince Charles. Nor was this the only error of that\r\nzealous, but inexperienced general: through his representations, the\r\nfalse intelligence that an army of ten thousand men was awaiting him in\r\nScotland, was conveyed to the Prince; the disembarkation of this force\r\nwas continually and confidently expected. \"The first thing we did in the\r\nmorning,\" says Chevalier Johnstone, \"was to see whether the wind was\r\nfavourable;\" and this delusive expectation had a very great influence in\r\ndeciding the resolution taken at Derby to retreat to Scotland.\r\n\r\nWhatever were the reasons which actuated the council of war, the result\r\nwas, in the first instance, both painful to those who promoted the\r\ndecision of the question, and highly obnoxious to the army. Arrangements\r\nwere, however, made to keep the proposed retreat as secret as possible,\r\nboth in order to baffle the Duke of Cumberland and not to irritate the\r\nHighlanders. Yet the design was soon penetrated by those who were intent\r\nupon every movement of their superiors. Lord George Murray, in his\r\njournal, describes the sensation which the projected retreat occasioned,\r\nin the following terms.[140] \"Our resolution was to be kept secret, as\r\nit was of great consequence the enemy should have the intelligence of\r\nour march as late as possible. Yet, in the afternoon, one Sir John\r\nMacdonald, an Irish officer in the French service who had come over with\r\nthe Prince, came where Lochiel, and Keppoch and I were talking together,\r\nand railed a great deal about our retreat. 'What!' says he to Keppoch,\r\n'a Macdonald turn his back?' and to Lochiel, 'For shame; a Cameron run\r\naway from the enemy! Go forward, and I'll lead you.' This gentleman was\r\nold, and had dined heartily, for he was much subject to his bottle: we\r\nendeavoured to persuade him that he was mistaken, but he still insisted,\r\nand said he had certain information of it. To tell the truth, I believe\r\nhe liked his quarters and entertainment better in England than in\r\nScotland, and would rather have been taken than return; for he thought,\r\nas he was in the French service, he did not run the same risk as others\r\ndid. Some people, seeing the Prince so much cast down about the retreat,\r\nto ingratiate themselves, blamed the resolution; and though they had in\r\nthe morning, as much as any body, given their hearty concurrence in the\r\nmeasure, and had exprest themselves so; yet, as they saw the retreat\r\nwould certainly be put in execution, though they appeared against it,\r\nthey thought proper to say that their reason for agreeing to it was\r\nbecause they knew the army would never fight well when the officers were\r\nagainst it. Sir Thomas Sheridan and his Royal Highness's secretary acted\r\nthis part. And the Duke of Atholl, who had not been present in the\r\nmorning, when the Prince sent for him in the afternoon, and spoke to\r\nhim, seemed much for going forwards. In the evening, when this was\r\nunderstood by the rest of the officers, they told his Royal Highness\r\nthat they valued their lives as little as brave men ought to do; and if\r\nhe inclined to go forward they would do their duty to the last, but\r\ndesired that those that advised his Royal Highness to go forward would\r\nsign their opinion, which would be a satisfaction to them. This put a\r\nstop to all underhand dealings, and the Duke of Atholl when he heard\r\nothers upon the same subject, was fully satisfied as to the necessity of\r\nthe measure.\"\r\n\r\nThe town of Derby presented, during its occupation by the Jacobites, a\r\nsingular scene. The Highlanders, hitherto maintaining a character for\r\ngood order, now broke loose upon the townsmen of a city, which they,\r\nperhaps, began to consider as their own. They took the opportunity of\r\nreplenishing themselves with gloves, buckles, powder-flasks,\r\nhandkerchiefs, &c., which they demanded from the tradespeople, whose\r\nshops they entered. Being refreshed with a good night's rest, they ran\r\nabout from house to house, until the town looked as if it were the\r\nresort of some Highland fair. \"If they liked a person's shoes better\r\nthan their own,\" relates a contemporary writer, \"nothing was more common\r\nfor them than to demand them off their feet, and not to give them\r\nanything, or what they asked for them.\" This insolence grew upon the\r\nforbearance of the townsmen, who dared not to resist martial law. Even\r\nthe medical profession did not escape an unwilling participation in the\r\nconcerns of the Jacobites. Dr. Hope, a physician residing in the town,\r\nand a member of the highly-respectable family there, was summoned to\r\nattend one of the sojourners in Exeter-house. The tradition which has\r\npreserved this anecdote among the descendants of Dr. Hope, has not\r\nspecified the name of the invalid. The physician was told that he must\r\ngo instantly: he was blindfolded, and led by armed men into the presence\r\nof his patient, without knowing whither he was conducted; a precaution,\r\nit may be presumed, adopted to prevent a refusal.\r\n\r\nThe church of All Saints witnessed what its Protestant ministers must\r\nhave viewed with indignation and sorrow. Prayers were ordered to be said\r\nat six o'clock in the evening, when a Roman Catholic clergyman entered\r\nthe sacred edifice, and performed the service according to the ritual of\r\nhis church.[141]\r\n\r\nIn addition to these impolitic acts of a short-lived power,\r\nproclamations were made by the Town Crier, levying the excise duties;\r\nand a demand of one hundred pounds was made upon the post-office. In\r\nother quarters, even these forms were omitted, and plunder and outrage,\r\nwhich, says the author of the Derby Mercury, \"were they to be stated\r\nwould fill our paper,\" were mercilessly committed. Nevertheless, such\r\nwas the tendency of the town of Derby to Jacobite principles, that,\r\namong the higher orders, the brief appearance of the young and\r\nunfortunate adventurer was long remembered with interest, and his fate\r\nrecalled with regret. The ladies of Derby vied with each other in making\r\nwhite cockades, of delicate and costly workmanship, to present to the\r\nhero of the day. To some of these admiring votaries he presented his\r\npicture, a dangerous gift in after-times, when a strict system of\r\nscrutiny prevailed; and when even to be suspected of Jacobite principles\r\nwas an effectual barrier to all promotion in offices, and a severe\r\ninjury to those in trade. One of these Jacobite ladies[142] is known by\r\nher family to have kept the portrait of the Prince behind the door of\r\nher bedchamber, carefully veiled from any but friendly inspection.\r\n\r\nEarly on the morning of Friday, the sixth of December, the drums beat to\r\narms, and the bagpipes were heard playing in different parts of the\r\ntown: the forces, it was expected by the townsmen, were thus summoned to\r\ncontinue their march to Loughborough, a town full of Jacobites, who were\r\nknown to have been pledging the young adventurer's health on their bare\r\nand bended knees.[143] The retreat was begun in such haste, and attended\r\nwith such confusion, that many of the Highlanders left their arms behind\r\nthem, where they were quartered.\r\n\r\nAt nine o'clock, Prince Charles, in deep dejection, was seen mounted on\r\na black horse, which had belonged to the brave Colonel Gardiner;--to\r\nquit Exeter-house, and, crossing the market-place, to proceed to\r\nBroken-row; he then turned through Sadler Gate, towards Ashbourn; he was\r\nfollowed by the main body of his army. Before eleven o'clock, Derby, so\r\nlately resembling, in its busy streets, the animated scene of a Highland\r\nfair, was totally cleared of all the Highland troops. But the\r\nconsternation of the inhabitants paralyzed them. On that day no market\r\nwas held, as usual; nor did the bells toll to church on the next Sunday;\r\nnor was divine service performed in any of the numerous and fine\r\nchurches which grace the town.[144]\r\n\r\nThe retreat, thus begun under such inauspicious circumstances, was left\r\nsolely to the guidance of the General who had so earnestly recommended\r\nit; and Lord George Murray took the sole management of it. In the dawn\r\nof the morning, when some of the troops had begun their march, the\r\nHighlanders did not perceive in which direction they were marching; they\r\nbelieved that they were going to give the Duke of Cumberland battle.\r\nWhen they discovered that they were in retreat, a murmur of lamentation\r\nran through the ranks. \"The inferior officers,\" Lord Elcho relates,[145]\r\n\"were much surprised when they found the army moving back, and imagined\r\nsome bad news had been received; but, when they were told everything,\r\nand found the army had marched so far into England without the least\r\ninvitation from any Englishman of distinction, they blamed their\r\nsuperiors much for carrying them so far, and approved much of going back\r\nto Scotland. They had all along imagined they were marching to join the\r\nEnglish, and were acting in concert with them. To the common men it was\r\ngiven out the army was going to meet their friends from Scotland, and to\r\nprevent Marshal Wade from getting in between them, whose army was at\r\nWetherby and Doncaster.\"\r\n\r\nThe influence, however, of these contradictory reports upon the common\r\nmen was soon conspicuous. The march was at first regular enough; but the\r\nwhole bearing of the Highlanders was changed. Dispirited and indignant,\r\nthey became reckless in their conduct: they lingered on the way, and\r\ncommitted outrages of which but few instances had been heard during\r\ntheir march southwards. Lord George Murray found it difficult to keep\r\nhis army together. \"In the advance,\" observes Sir Walter Scott, \"they\r\nshowed the sentiments of brave men, come, in their opinion, to liberate\r\ntheir fellow-citizens; in the retreat, they were caterans, returning\r\nfrom a creagh.\" The cause which they had adopted, had lost, from this\r\nmoment, all hope, though the mournful interest attached to it still\r\nremained, perhaps, with increasing force.\r\n\r\nIn order to conceal the retreat as long from the enemy as possible, a\r\nparty of horse was ordered to advance some miles in the direction of\r\nLichfield, where the Duke of Cumberland was posted; and, to keep up the\r\ndelusion, powder was distributed among the army. It was also insinuated\r\nthat Wade was at hand, and that they were going to fight him; but when\r\nthe soldiers found themselves on the road to Ashbourn they suspected the\r\ntruth, and became still more sullen and dejected. Another artifice\r\nadopted to raise their spirits was a report, circulated purposely among\r\nthem, that the reinforcements expected from Scotland were on their road,\r\nand that having met these, near Preston the army would resume its march\r\nsouthwards. This project, however distasteful to Lord George Murray,\r\nwas, it seems, seriously entertained by the Prince.\r\n\r\nAnd now commenced the difficulties of that undertaking in which Lord\r\nGeorge had pledged himself to conduct an army of little more than six\r\nthousand men, in the depth of winter, in safety to Scotland, although in\r\nthe neighbourhood of two great armies. The management of this retreat\r\nhas been a subject of admiration to all competent judges of military\r\naffairs; it has conferred lasting honour on the capacity of Lord George\r\nMurray as a General.\r\n\r\nIt was of the greatest importance, under his circumstances, that Lord\r\nGeorge should know of the movements and intentions of the enemy; and\r\nsuch was his system, such his address, in employing spies and\r\nemissaries, that he was always informed of what took place in the armies\r\nof the Duke and General Wade. One of his principal agents was Hewett, a\r\nbutcher in Derby; who, from his local knowledge, could tell many\r\nparticulars of the country-gentlemen, as well as of the movements of the\r\nDuke and his formidable forces.[146]\r\n\r\nThe Highland army arrived on the night of the sixth at Ashbourn, on the\r\nfollowing day they reached Leek, on the ninth they arrived at\r\nManchester, where a great revulsion of feeling had taken place. The\r\n\"Hanoverian mob,\" to use the expression of Mr. Maxwell, were determined\r\nto dispute the Prince's entrance; but when his vanguard appeared, these\r\nnoisy heroes were instantly silenced.[147] From Manchester the Prince\r\nproceeded to Wigan, and thence to Preston, where he halted on the\r\ntwelfth. Here the disappointed young man recurred to his cherished\r\nproject, that of having reinforcements sent from Scotland, under\r\nViscount Strathallan, who had been left in command at Perth, and those\r\nalso under Lord John Drummond. Upon his arrival at Preston, he sent the\r\nDuke of Perth into Scotland to bring them with the utmost expedition. He\r\nwas resolved to retire no further until he met them, and then to march\r\ndirectly for London, casting his whole chance of success upon the event\r\nof that step.\r\n\r\nAmong the generals and chiefs of this army a different sentiment had now\r\narisen. A safe retreat was their object, and the subject of universal\r\nattention. Hitherto there had been little or no danger; it was\r\nimpossible for the enemy to overtake the army before it had reached\r\nPreston; but between Preston and Carlisle it was practicable for the\r\nenemy's cavalry to come up with the Prince's army during that march.\r\nThere was even a greater danger to be apprehended than the pursuit of\r\nthe Duke. Marshal Wade had left his position at Newcastle-upon-Tyne,\r\nhaving been ordered by the Duke to place himself between the insurgent\r\nforces and Scotland, in order to cut off the retreat. There were in\r\nthose days but few roads, or even passes in the mountainous regions of\r\nCumberland and Westmoreland, by which a regular army could march. There\r\nwas, however, an excellent road from Newcastle to Penrith, a town\r\nthrough which Wade might march his army, and where he could arrive a day\r\nor two before the Prince, and intercept his retreat.\r\n\r\nOn the fifteenth the Prince arrived at Kendal, and here Lord George\r\nMurray, taking a body of life-guards, went in person to reconnoitre the\r\nposition of the enemy. He brought back several prisoners, who gave him\r\nall the information of which he was desirous. From what was thus\r\ngathered, Lord George perceived that the whole cavalry of Wade's army\r\nmight possibly overtake the Highland forces before they could reach\r\nCarlisle; he therefore represented to the Prince the propriety of\r\nsacrificing the cannon and heavy baggage to the safety of the men; since\r\nthe mountainous journey from Kendal to Penrith rendered the transit of\r\nsuch carriages very difficult. But the Prince was determined that his\r\nretreat should have the air of retiring, not of flying; he was resolved\r\nnot to leave a single piece of his cannon; he would rather fight both\r\narmies than give such a proof of weakness. He issued peremptory orders\r\nthat the march should be continued as before, and that not a single\r\ncarriage should be left at Kendal.\r\n\r\nThe dissensions between Charles Edward and Lord George Murray had now\r\nripened into reproaches on the one hand, answered by something not\r\nunlike taunts on the other. The former had cherished a predilection for\r\nbattles ever since his victory at Glandsmuir, and he often broke out\r\ninto expressions of anger towards his General, for his having prevented\r\nhis fighting the Duke of Cumberland at Derby. As they quitted Kendal,\r\nLord George observed to Charles, \"Since your Royal Highness is always\r\nfor battles, be the circumstances what they may; I now offer you one, in\r\nthree hours from this time, with the army of Marshal Wade, who is only\r\nthree miles distant from this place.\" The Prince made no reply, but\r\nmounted into his carriage. All his ardour in marching at the head of the\r\nClans was gone; he had become listless, careless, and dejected since the\r\nretreat. The army were dispirited by his gloomy and mournful aspect; and\r\na still greater degree of difficulty and responsibility devolved\r\ntherefore upon their General. On the sixteenth of December the army\r\nslept at Shap, and on the seventeenth the Prince arrived at Penrith; but\r\nthe artillery, and the regiment of the Macdonalds of Glengarry, could\r\nonly reach Shap by nightfall.\r\n\r\nOn the following morning Lord George proceeded towards Penrith. Scarcely\r\nhad he begun his march when he saw a number of the enemy's light horse\r\nhovering about, but not venturing within musket-shot. About midday, as\r\nthe Highland army began to ascend an eminence about half-way between\r\nShap and Penrith, they discovered cavalry riding two and two abreast on\r\nthe top of the hill. These instantly disappeared, but the noise of the\r\nkettle-drums and trumpets announced that they were only on the other\r\nside of the hill, and that they were probably forming in order of\r\nbattle. Lord George was in the rear of the Highland army.\r\n\r\nThe advanced guard stopped at the foot of the hill, when suddenly they\r\nformed a resolution to advance sword in hand on the enemy, without\r\ninforming Lord George of their resolution. On arriving at the summit of\r\nthe hill, the party whose kettle-drums and trumpets had caused such an\r\nalarm, were found to be only three hundred light horse and chasseurs,\r\nwho instantly fled. One prisoner only was made, a man who fell from his\r\nhorse. It was desirable, on all accounts, to have preserved the life of\r\nthis person, but the fury of the Highlanders was such that he was\r\ninstantly cut to pieces.\r\n\r\nAfter this alarm, this detachment of the Highland army resumed their\r\nmarch: the appearance of the light horse had, however, begotten an\r\nimpression that Wade's forces were not far distant. The Chevalier\r\nJohnstone, more especially, had strong misgivings on the subject; his\r\nfears were confirmed by his serjeant Dickson, who called his attention\r\nto something black on a hill about three miles distant. This appearance,\r\nwhich every one else regarded as bushes, was soon found to be the\r\nEnglish army, slowly but surely advancing. Before the vanguard could\r\nrecover the surprise, the Duke of Cumberland, who had pursued them with\r\nforced marches, fell upon the Macdonalds, who were in the rear, with\r\nfury. Fortunately the road running between thorn hedges and ditches, the\r\nEnglish cavalry could not act in such a manner as to surround the army,\r\nnor present a larger front than the breadth of the road.\r\n\r\nThe Highlanders instantly ran to the enclosures in which the English\r\nwere, fell on their knees, and began to cut down the hedges with their\r\ndirks. This precaution was necessary, for their limbs were unprotected\r\nby anything lower than their kilts. During this operation, they\r\nsustained the fire of the English with admirable firmness. As soon as\r\nthe hedges were cut down, they jumped into the enclosures sword in hand,\r\nand broke the English battalions. A fierce and deadly contest ensued.\r\nThe English were nearly cut to pieces without quitting their ground.\r\nPlatoons might, indeed, be seen, composed of forty or fifty men falling\r\nbeneath the Highlanders, yet they remained firm, closing up their ranks,\r\nas fast as an opening was made by the broad-swords of the Highlanders.\r\nThis remarkable attack was made in person by Lord George Murray, at the\r\nhead of the Macphersons, whom he ordered to charge. At length the\r\nEnglish dragoons were driven from their posts, and closely pursued until\r\nthey arrived at the moor where their main body was planted. In this\r\n\"scuffle\" the Macphersons lost only twelve men; about one hundred of the\r\nEnglish were killed or wounded. A footman in the service of the Duke of\r\nCumberland was the only prisoner made by the Highlanders. This man\r\ndeclared that his royal master would have been killed, if the pistol,\r\nwith which a Highlander took aim at his head, had not missed fire.\r\nPrince Charles, with much courtesy, sent him back instantly to the\r\nDuke.[148]\r\n\r\nSuch is a brief account of the engagement which Lord George Murray calls\r\na \"little skirmish,\" but which must have afforded, at all events, some\r\nnotion of Highland valour to the Duke of Cumberland and his dragoons.\r\nBut, independent of the dauntless bravery of the Macphersons, to the\r\nskill of Lord George Murray may be attributed much of the success of the\r\naction. Before the firing began, he contrived, by rolling up his\r\ncolours, and causing them to be carried half open to different places,\r\nto deceive the enemy with regard to the numbers of the Highland force;\r\nand to make them conclude that the whole of the army was posted in the\r\nvillage of Clifton. With about a thousand men in all, he contrived to\r\ndefeat five hundred dragoons, backed by a great body of cavalry, all\r\nwell disciplined troops. The moon, which was in its second quarter,\r\nappeared at intervals during the close of the action, and gave but a\r\nfitful light, being often over-clouded, so that the combatants fought\r\nalmost in gloom, except for a few minutes at a time. The English, being\r\nall on horseback, were just visible to their foes, but the \"little\r\nHighlanders\" were in darkness. \"We had the advantage,\" observes Lord\r\nGeorge, \"of seeing their disposition, but they could not see ours.\"[149]\r\nThis encounter had the effect of saving the Prince and the whole army.\r\n\"It was lucky,\" calmly remarks Lord George Murray, \"that I made that\r\nstand at Clifton, for otherwise the enemy would have been at our heels,\r\nand come straight to Penrith, where, after refreshing two or three\r\nhours, they might have come up with us before we got to Carlisle.\"[150]\r\n\r\nLord George was in imminent danger during the action at Clifton.\r\nFortunately, an old man, Glenbucket, who was very infirm, remained at\r\nthe end of the village on horseback. He entreated Lord George to be very\r\ncareful, \"for if any accident happened, he would be blamed.\" \"He gave\r\nme,\" relates Lord George, \"his targe; it was convex, and covered with a\r\nplate of metal, which was painted; the paint was cleared in two or\r\nthree places, with the enemy's bullets; and, indeed, they were so thick\r\nabout me, that I felt them hot about my head, and I thought some of them\r\nwent through my hair, which was about two inches long, my bonnet having\r\nfallen off.\"[151]\r\n\r\nIn this skirmish Lord George commanded the Glengarry regiment, who had\r\nremained, at the General's request, in the rear, to guard the baggage.\r\nThe officers, observes Lord George, \"behaved to my wish, and punctually\r\nobeyed the orders they received. That very morning, however, the\r\nGlengarry regiment had told Lord George that they would not have stayed\r\nthree days behind the rest of the army to guard the baggage for any man\r\nbut himself.\" The Stewarts, of Appin, were also among the most valiant\r\nof the combatants; but the most signal instances of courage were shown\r\nby Macpherson of Clunie, and his fierce band.\r\n\r\nThis unfortunate chief was engaged in the insurrection of 1715; that\r\ncircumstance had been overlooked by Government; and, in the very year\r\n1745, he had been appointed to a company in Lord Loudon's regiment, and\r\nhad taken the oaths to Government. His clan were, however, anxious to\r\nespouse the cause of Charles Edward. Whilst Clunie wavered, his honour\r\nrequiring the fulfilment of his oaths, his affections, and his\r\nhereditary principles leading him to follow Charles, his wife, although\r\na stanch Jacobite, and a daughter of Lord Lovat, entreated him not to\r\nbreak his oaths, and represented that nothing would end well which began\r\nwith perjury. She was overruled by the friends of Clunie, and he\r\nhastened to his ruin.[152]\r\n\r\nThe victorious General remained at Clifton half an hour after all the\r\nother officers had proceeded to Penrith. This circumstance disproved a\r\nstatement given in the English newspapers, which intimated that the\r\nHighlanders had been beaten from their post at Clifton. On the contrary,\r\n\"I heard,\" observed Lord George, \"that the enemy went a good many miles\r\nfor quarters, and I am persuaded they were as weary of that day's\r\nfatigue as we could be.\"\r\n\r\nUpon arriving at Penrith, Lord George found the Prince much pleased with\r\nwhat had occurred. He was, however, just taking horse for Carlisle. On\r\nthe next day, after staying a very short time at Penrith to refresh,\r\nLord George joined Charles Edward in that city, which had yielded so\r\nshort a time previously to his arms; and here various circumstances\r\noccurred which sufficiently show the discord which prevailed in the\r\ncouncils of the young Chevalier.\r\n\r\nDuring the march, the young Prince had manifested a lofty sense of his\r\nown honour; but it was combined with a great degree of obstinacy in some\r\nrespects, almost accompanied by puerility. Disgusted with the retreat,\r\nindignant with the promoter of that step, bent upon returning to\r\nEngland, unhappy, discouraged, and distracted by evil counsels, the\r\nPrince had plainly shown, that he would controvert the opinions of Lord\r\nGeorge in every possible instance. He had lingered so late in the\r\nmorning before leaving his quarters, as to detain the rear, which that\r\nGeneral commanded, long after the van. This was a great inconvenience,\r\nand difficult for an impetuous temper to tolerate. The Prince not only\r\nrefused to allow the army to be eased of any of the ammunition, being\r\nresolved \"rather to fight both their armies than to give such a proof of\r\nhis weakness;\"[153] but he carried that order to an extreme, behaving as\r\na petulant young man, who exerts power more in anger than from\r\nreflection. The march thus encumbered had been made with a degree of\r\ndifficulty and fatigue which tried the patience of the soldiers, who\r\nwere obliged, in one instance, to drag, like horses, the heavy waggons,\r\nin order to get them through a stream of water where there was a narrow\r\npass, and a steep ascent.[154]\r\n\r\nNo enemy had molested the troops after they left Penrith; and it\r\nappeared evident that, at that time, the Duke of Cumberland had no\r\nintention of coming to a pitched battle, but intended only to take\r\nadvantage of the disorder which he might suppose would have attended the\r\nretreat of an army of militia.\r\n\r\nOn arriving at Carlisle, a council of war was held. Lord George Murray\r\nwas in favour of evacuating Carlisle, but his influence was overruled.\r\n\"I had been so much fatigued,\" he remarks, \"for some days before, that I\r\nwas very little at the Prince's quarters that day.\" It was, however,\r\ndetermined to leave a garrison in Carlisle, for Prince Charles had set\r\nhis heart upon returning to England. He, therefore, placed in the castle\r\nMr. Hamilton, whilst the unfortunate Mr. Townley commanded the town.\r\n\r\n\"This,\" remarks Mr Maxwell,[155] \"was perhaps the worst resolution that\r\nthe Prince had taken hitherto. I cannot help condemning it, though there\r\nwere specious pretexts for it.\" It would, indeed, have been highly\r\nadvantageous for the Prince to have retained one of the keys of England;\r\nand he might have hoped to return before the place could be retaken. Of\r\nthis, however, he could not be certain; and he was undoubtedly wrong in\r\nexposing the lives of the garrison without an indispensable necessity,\r\nwhich, according to Maxwell, did not exist; for \"blowing up the castle,\r\nand the gates of the town might equally have given him an entry into\r\nEngland.\"\r\n\r\nThe day after the Prince had arrived in Carlisle, he left it, and\r\nproceeded northwards. One cause of this, apparently, needless haste was,\r\nthe state of the river Esk, about seven miles from Carlisle; it was, by\r\na nearer road, impassable. This stream, it was argued, might be swollen\r\nby a few hours rain, and then it could not be forded. The Prince might\r\nthus be detained at Carlisle; and he had now become extremely impatient\r\nto know the exact state of his affairs in Scotland; to collect his\r\nforces, in order to return to England. Letters from Lord John Drummond\r\nhad re-assured him of the good will of the Court of France--that\r\ndelusive hope was not even then extinct. Advice from Viscount\r\nStrathallan had imparted excellent accounts of the army in Scotland.\r\nUnder these circumstances, Charles hastened forward, and encountered the\r\ndifficult passage over the Esk. Hope again gladdened the heart of one\r\nfor whose errors, when we consider the stake for which he fought, and\r\nthe cherished wishes of his youth, too little allowance has been made.\r\nBut, in the eyes of others, the prospect of the young Chevalier's return\r\nto England was regarded as wholly visionary; and the planting a garrison\r\nin the dilapidated fortress of Carlisle, was deemed indifference to the\r\nfate of his adherents who remained, unwillingly, and certain of their\r\ndoom. \"The retreat from Derby was considered throughout England,\"\r\nobserves Sir Walter Scott, \"as the close of the rebellion: as a\r\nphysician regards a distemper to be nearly overcome, when he can drive\r\nit from the stomach and nobler parts, into the extremities of the\r\nbody.\"[156]\r\n\r\nThe army, after marching from three o'clock in the morning until two in\r\nthe afternoon, arrived on the borders of the Esk. This river, which is\r\nusually shallow, had already been swollen by an incessant rain of\r\nseveral days, to the depth of four feet. It was, therefore, necessary to\r\ncross it instantly, for fear of a continuation of the rain, and an\r\nincrease of the danger. The passage over the Esk was admirably\r\ncontrived; it could only have been effected by Highlanders. The cavalry\r\nformed in the river, to break the force of the current, about\r\ntwenty-five paces above the ford where the infantry were to pass. Then\r\nthe Highlanders plunged into the water, arranging themselves into ranks\r\nof ten or twelve a-breast, with their arms locked in such a manner as to\r\nsupport one another against the rapidity of the river, leaving\r\nsufficient intervals between their ranks for the passage of the water.\r\n\"We were nearly a hundred men a-breast,\" writes Lord George\r\nMurray;[157] \"and it was a very fine show. The water was big, and most\r\nof the men breast-high. When I was near across the river, I believe\r\nthere were two thousand men in the water at once: there was nothing seen\r\nbut their heads and shoulders; but there was no danger, for we had\r\ncrossed many waters, and the ford was good; and Highlanders will pass a\r\nwater where horses will not, which I have often seen. They hold by one\r\nanother, by the neck of the coat, so that if one should fall, he is in\r\nno danger, being supported by the others, so all went down, or none.\"\r\n\r\nThe scene must have been extremely singular. \"The interval between the\r\ncavalry,\" remarks an eyewitness, \"appeared like a paved street through\r\nthe river, the heads of the Highlanders being generally all that was\r\nseen above the water. Cavalry were also placed beneath the ford, to pick\r\nup all those who might be carried away by the current. In an hour's time\r\nthe whole army had passed the river Esk; and the boundary between\r\nEngland and Scotland was again passed.\"[158]\r\n\r\nLord George Murray had, on this occasion, assumed the national dress. \"I\r\nwas this day,\" he says \"in my philibeg.\" Well might he, in after times,\r\nwhen reviewing the events of the memorable campaign of 1745, dwell with\r\npride on the hardihood of those countrymen from whom he was for ever an\r\nexile when he composed his journal. \"All the bridges that were thrown\r\ndown in England,\" he remarks, \"to prevent their advancing in their march\r\nforwards, never retarded them a moment.\" Nor was the philibeg assumed\r\nmerely for the convenience of the passage over the Esk. \"I did not\r\nknow,\" writes Lord George, \"but the enemy might have come from Penrith\r\nby Brampton, so shunned the water of Eden, to have attacked us in\r\npassing this water of Esk; and nothing encouraged the men more, than\r\nseeing their officers dressed like themselves, and ready to share their\r\nfate.\"\r\n\r\nSome ladies had forded the river on horseback immediately before the\r\nHighland regiments. These fair, and bold equestrians might have given\r\nintelligence; but luckily they did not. The General who had provided so\r\ncarefully and admirably for the safety of his troops, knew well how to\r\ntemper discipline with indulgence. Fires were instantly kindled to dry\r\nthe men as they quitted the water. The poor Highlanders, when they found\r\nthemselves on Scottish ground, forgot all the vexation of their retreat,\r\nand broke out into expressions of joy;--of short lived continuance among\r\na slaughtered and hunted people. It was near night; yet the bagpipes\r\nstruck up a national air as the last of the Highland host passed the\r\nriver: and the Highlanders began dancing reels, \"which,\" relates Lord\r\nGeorge, \"in a moment dried them, for they had held up the tails of their\r\nshort coats in passing the river; so when their legs were dry, all was\r\nright.\" This day, forming an epoch in the sorrowful narrative of the\r\ninsurrection of 1745, was the birthday of Prince Charles, who then\r\nattained his twenty-fifth year. Many mercies had marked the expedition\r\ninto England, fruitless as it had proved. After six weeks' march, and\r\nsojourn, in England, amid innumerable enemies, threatened by two\r\nformidable armies in different directions, the Jacobite forces, entering\r\nEngland on the eighth of November, and quitting it on the twentieth of\r\nDecember, had returned without losing more than forty men, including the\r\ntwelve killed at Clifton Wall. They had traversed a country well-peopled\r\nwith English peasantry, without any attacks except upon such marauders\r\nas strayed from their main body.\r\n\r\nAs soon as the army had passed the river, the Prince formed it into two\r\ncolumns, which separated; the one, conducted by Charles Edward, took the\r\nroad to Ecclefechan; the other, under the command of Lord George Murray,\r\nmarched to Annan. In the disposition of these routes, the principal\r\nobject was to keep the English in a state of uncertainty as to the\r\ndirection in which the Jacobite army intended to go, and the towns which\r\nthey purposed to occupy: and the end was answered; for no just notion\r\nwas given of the movements of the Highlanders until after the subsequent\r\njunction of the two columns; and time was thus gained.\r\n\r\nThere being no town within eight or ten miles from the river Esk, the\r\narmy were obliged to march nearly all night. The column conducted by the\r\nPrince had to cross mossy ground, under a pouring rain, which had\r\ncontinued ever since the skirmish at Clifton Wall. The guides who\r\nconducted Lord George's division led them off the road; this was,\r\nhowever, a necessary precaution in order to shun houses, the lights from\r\nwhich might have tempted the drenched and hungry soldiers to stray, and\r\ntake shelter. Then the hardy and energetic general of his matchless\r\nforces first felt the effects of this laborious march in unusual\r\ndebility, and fever.\r\n\r\nAt Moffat, this column halted; and divine service was performed in\r\ndifferent parts of the town, all the men attending. \"Our people,\"\r\nremarks Lord George, \"were very regular that way; and I remember, at\r\nDerby, the day we halted, as a battle was soon expected, many of our\r\nofficers and people took the sacrament.\"[159]\r\n\r\nOn the twenty-fifth of December, Lord George arrived at Glasgow, having\r\npassed through the towns of Hamilton and Douglas, and here, on the\r\nfollowing day, Charles Edward also arrived, with the other column. Lord\r\nElcho, who had conducted the cavalry through Dumfries, preceded the two\r\ngreat divisions. It was resolved to give the army some days' rest after\r\nthe excessive fatigue which the men had uncomplainingly sustained. The\r\nspirits of Charles Edward were now recruited, and his example\r\ncontributed not a little to the alacrity and energy of his force. Small,\r\nindeed, did it appear, when he reviewed it on Glasgow-green, and found\r\nhow little he had suffered during his expedition into England. Hitherto\r\nCharles had carefully concealed his weakness; but now, hoping in a few\r\ndays to double his army, he was not unwilling to show with what a\r\nhandful of men he had penetrated into England, and conducted an\r\nenterprise, bold in its conception, and admirable in its performance.\r\n\r\nAt Glasgow, the melancholy fate of the brave garrison in Carlisle became\r\nknown to the Jacobite army. Two days after the Prince had left, the Duke\r\nof Cumberland invested it, and began to batter that part of the wall\r\nwhich is towards the Irish gate. The governor of the Castle, Mr.\r\nHamilton, determined to capitulate even before a breach had been made in\r\nthe walls; and his proposal was vainly resisted by the brave Francis\r\nTownley and others, who were resolved to defend themselves to the last\r\nextremity. \"They were in the right.\"[160] They might have held out for\r\nseveral days, and perhaps obtained better terms; but the governor\r\npersisted in surrendering to the clemency of King George, promised by\r\nhis inhuman and dishonourable son. Assurances of intercession were given\r\nby the Duke of Cumberland, and the garrison of three hundred men\r\nsurrendered. On the Duke's return to London, it was decided by the\r\nBritish government that he was not bound to observe a capitulation with\r\nrebels. The brave, and confiding prisoners perished, twelve of the\r\nofficers by the common hangman, at Kennington; others, at Carlisle--many\r\ndied in prison. Their fate reflected strongly upon the conduct of\r\nCharles Edward; but the general character of that young Prince, his\r\nhatred of blood, his love of his adherents, prove that it was not\r\nindifference to their safety which actuated him in the sacrifice of the\r\ngarrison of Carlisle. He was possessed with an infatuation, believing\r\nthat he should one day, and that day not distant, re-enter England; he\r\nwas surrounded by favourites, who all encouraged his predilections, and\r\nfostered the hereditary self-will of his ill-starred race. The blood of\r\nTownley, and of his brave fellow-sufferers, rests not as a stain on the\r\nmemory of Lord George Murray; and the Prince alone must bear the odium\r\nof that needless sacrifice to a visionary future. \"We must draw a veil,\"\r\nsays the Chevalier Johnstone, \"over this piece of cruelty, being\r\naltogether unable either to discover the motive for leaving this three\r\nhundred men at Carlisle, or to find an excuse for it.\"[161]\r\n\r\nOn arriving at Glasgow, the Prince sent a gentleman to Perth to procure\r\na particular account of the state of affairs in that part of the\r\ncountry; and on finding that his forces were so widely scattered that a\r\nconsiderable time must elapse before they could reassemble, he gave up\r\nthe hope of returning to England, and determined upon the sieges of\r\nEdinburgh and Stirling. On the fourth of January he marched from Glasgow\r\nto Bannockburn, where he took up his quarters; and Lord George Murray,\r\nwith the clans, occupied Falkirk. Before the twelfth of the same month,\r\nGeneral Hawley, who had now formed a considerable army in Edinburgh,\r\nresolved upon raising the siege of Stirling, before which the trenches\r\nwere opened.\r\n\r\nLord George Murray was, however, resolved to make a strong effort to\r\nprevent this scheme of General Hawley's from taking effect. Hearing that\r\nthere was a provision made of bread and forage at Linlithgow for General\r\nHawley's troops, he resolved to surprise the town and to carry off the\r\nprovisions. He set out at four o'clock in the morning; was joined by\r\nLord Elcho and Lord Pitsligo, with their several bodies of horse, and\r\nbefore sunrise Linlithgow was invested. The Jacobites were disturbed,\r\nhowever, in their quarters by a party of General Hawley's dragoons; and\r\na report which prevailed that another body of horse and foot were also\r\napproaching, induced Lord George to return to Falkirk. On the following\r\nday he returned to Stirling; and the clans were quartered in the\r\nadjacent villages. The reinforcements which had been so long expected\r\nfrom the north were now near at hand; so that they could scarcely fail\r\nto arrive before an engagement began. The clans were augmented in\r\nnumber, and what was almost of equal importance, they had regained\r\nconfidence and health on returning to their native land. All were in\r\nhigh spirits at the prospect of an engagement.\r\n\r\nThe Prince employed the fifteenth day of the month in choosing a field\r\nof battle; on the sixteenth he reviewed the army. The plan of the\r\nengagement was drawn out by Lord George Murray, according to his usual\r\npractice. The army of the insurgents amounted to nine thousand men. On\r\nthat evening he learned that General Hawley had encamped on the plain\r\nbetween that town and the river Carron: upon which a council was called,\r\nand it was resolved the next day to attack the enemy.\r\n\r\nThe sympathies of the modern reader can scarcely fail to be enlisted in\r\nthe cause of the Jacobites, who appear henceforth in the character of\r\nthe valiant defenders of their hills and homes, their hereditary\r\nmonarchy, their national honour and rights. Whatever an Englishman may\r\nhave felt on beholding the incursions of a Highland force in his own\r\ncountry, the sentiment is altered into one of respect and of compassion\r\nwhen he views the scene of the contest changed, and sees the hopeless\r\nstruggle fought on Scottish ground.\r\n\r\nNever were two parties more strongly contrasted than the Hanoverians and\r\nthe Jacobites. The very expressions which each party used towards the\r\nother, as well as their conduct in the strife, are characteristic of the\r\ncoarse insolence of possession, and the gallant contest for restoration.\r\nNothing could present a more revolting contrast than that between the\r\nindividuals who headed the armies of Government, and the unfortunate\r\nPrince Charles and his brave adherents. In opposition to his generosity\r\nand forbearance stood the remorseless vengeance of the Duke of\r\nCumberland. In comparison with the lofty, honest, fearless Lord George\r\nMurray, was the low instrument of Cumberland, the detestable Hawley. One\r\nblushes to write his name an English word. Succeeding General Wade,\r\nwhose feeble powers had become nearly extinct in the decline of age,\r\nGeneral Hawley was the beloved officer, the congenial associate of the\r\nyoung and royal commander-in-chief, who even at his early age could\r\nselect a man without love to man, or reverence to God, for his General.\r\nThese two were kindred spirits, worthy of an union in the task of\r\nbreaking the noblest hearts, and crushing and enslaving the finest\r\npeople that ever blessed a land of sublime beauty. Perhaps, if one may\r\nventure to make so strong an assertion, the General was more odious than\r\nhis patron. It is, indeed, no easy point to decide towards which of\r\nthese two notorious, for I will not call them distinguished men, the\r\ndisgust of all good minds must be excited in the greater degree. In\r\ncontempt for their fellow men, in suspicion and distrust, they were\r\nalike. In the directions for Hawley's funeral, he wrote in his will:\r\n\"The priest, I conclude, will have his fee: let the puppy take it. I\r\nhave written all this with my own hand; and this I did because I hate\r\npriests of all professions, and have the worst opinion of all members of\r\nthe law.\"\r\n\r\nTo this low and ignorant contempt for the members of two learned\r\nprofessions, Hawley added an utter disregard of every tie of honour; he\r\nwas wholly unconscious of the slightest emotion of humanity; he revelled\r\nin the terrors of power. The citizens beheld, with disgust, gibbets\r\nerected on his arrival there, to hang up any rebels who might fall into\r\nhis hands: the very soldiers detested the General who had executioners\r\nto attend the army. The generous nature of Englishmen turned against the\r\nman, who, as it has been well remarked, \"deserved not the name of\r\nsoldier.\" They gave him the nick-name of the \"Chief Justice;\" and hated\r\nhim as a man unworthy to cope with brave and honourable foes.\r\n\r\nGeneral Hawley had all the contempt, fashionable in those days, for\r\nHighland valour. \"Give me but two regiments of horse,\" he said, \"and I\r\nwill soon ride over the whole Highland army.\" He quickly, however,\r\nlearned his mistake; his contempt was, therefore, changed into a\r\nfiendish abhorrence, exhibited in the most horrible forms of unmitigated\r\nrevenge.\r\n\r\nIt was decided by Charles and his Generals, in a council held on the\r\nevening preceding the battle of Falkirk, to attack the Hanoverian troops\r\nby break of day. The Tor Wood, formerly an extensive forest, but much\r\ndecayed, lay between the two armies. The high road from Stirling to\r\nFalkirk, through Bannockburn, passes through what was once the middle of\r\nthe wood. About eleven in the morning the Jacobite army was seen,\r\nmarching in two columns, and advancing to the rising ground. Scarcely\r\nhad they begun their march than the sky was overcast, and a violent\r\nstorm blinded their enemy, who were, on the other hand, marching with\r\ntheir bayonets fixed; the fury of the tempest was such, that they could\r\nhardly secure their pieces from the rain.\r\n\r\nLord George Murray, with his drawn sword in his hand, and his target on\r\nhis arm, conducted the Macdonalds of Keppoch. This clan regiment\r\nadvanced very slowly that they might keep their ranks until they had\r\ngained possession of the ground they wanted; they then turned their\r\nbacks to the wind, and formed into the line of battle. The field which\r\nthey intended to occupy was skirted by a deep morass as they came foot\r\nby foot, within pistol shot of the enemy.\r\n\r\nMeantime, General Ligonier, with three regiments of dragoons, began to\r\nmove towards the Highlanders: whilst Lord George Murray, riding along\r\nthe ranks of the Macdonalds, was forbidding them to fire until he gave\r\norders. The English came at last, on full trot, almost close up to the\r\nline: then Lord George Murray gave the word of command to fire; the\r\ndragoons were instantly repulsed and fled back; upon which Lord George\r\ncommanded the Macdonalds to keep within ranks, and stand firm. A total\r\nrout of the King's troops ensued; and the field of battle presented a\r\nstrange spectacle. The English troops were, during the whole of the\r\nbattle, severely incommoded by the storm of wind and rain, which almost\r\nblinded the enemy; but, independent of this accidental cause, their\r\nusual valour was, on this day, called into question. They fled in every\r\ndirection. This famous battle did not last more than twenty minutes from\r\nthe first fire of the Macdonalds to the retreat of the last regiment of\r\ndragoons. Before it grew dark General Hawley gave orders that his tents\r\nshould be burned; he then retreated to Linlithgow.\r\n\r\nMany brave English officers fell in this ill-conducted engagement, and\r\ntheir defeat was attributed at once to the arrogant confidence of\r\nHawley, and to the courage and discipline of the Macdonalds of Keppoch,\r\nwho, under the skilful command of Lord George Murray, are considered to\r\nhave won the day. \"If the bravery of the Macdonald regiments were put\r\nout of view,\" observes Mr. Chambers, \"it might be said that the storm\r\nhad gained the Jacobites the battle.\"\r\n\r\nBut the rain, which lasted during the whole of the battle, prevented a\r\nfull advantage of the defeat being taken. The Highlanders, who do not\r\nuse cartridges, were unable to load again, but were forced to have\r\nrecourse to their broadswords; they were, however, out-lined by one-half\r\nof the enemy's infantry, and one of the battalions wheeling about, they\r\nwere thrown into disorder by the force of a flank fire. They retreated\r\nup the hill, and before they could be rallied, the English, who could\r\nnot be prevailed upon to stand a second attack of the Highland\r\nbroadswords, had begun an orderly retreat. Had the whole of the\r\nJacobite army been at hand, to rush headlong upon the enemy the moment\r\nthey turned their backs, few of their infantry would have escaped being\r\nkilled or taken.[162]\r\n\r\nLord George Murray, advancing with the Atholl men, who had kept the line\r\nin perfect order, pursued the retreating army towards Falkirk. He had\r\narrived at the foot of the hill just as the English troops entered the\r\ntown, which was at the distance of a musket-shot from the place where he\r\nstood. It was then proposed by most of the officers to retire towards\r\nDunnipace, in order to shelter the men from the incessant rain; but Lord\r\nGeorge opposed this proposition. He had observed the disorder of the\r\nEnglish: \"Let them not have time,\" he remarked, \"to rally, and to line\r\nthe houses, and clean their guns, so as to defend the town of Falkirk;\r\nthere is not a moment to be lost.\" He concluded with the expression of\r\nCount Mercy at the battle of Parma--\"I will either lie in the town, or\r\nin Paradise.\"\r\n\r\nPrince Charles coming up at the instant, approved of the resolution. A\r\nsingular difficulty now occurred; there were no bag-pipes to inspirit\r\nthe men with a warlike air; the pipers, as soon as a battle began, were\r\nin the practice of giving their pipes into the keeping of boys, who had\r\nto take care of themselves, and often disappeared with the instruments.\r\n\"The pipers, who,\" as Lord George remarks, \"were commonly as good men as\r\nany,\" then charged with the rest. This circumstance, which might appear\r\ntrifling, was in fact the cause why the Macdonalds and other Clans had\r\nnot rallied from the first.[163] Such was the importance of the\r\nnational music at this critical moment. In ancient days the bards shared\r\nthe office of encouragement to the Clans. It was their part to stimulate\r\nvalour, and, before the battle began they passed from tribe to tribe,\r\ngiving exhortations, and expatiating on the dishonour of retreat. They\r\nfamiliarized the people with a notion of death, and took from it, in one\r\nsense, its sting. When their voices could no longer be heard, they were\r\nsucceeded by the pipes, whose wailing and powerful strains kept alive\r\nthe enthusiasm which languished when those notes ceased to be\r\nheard.[164]\r\n\r\nLochiel, Lord Ogilvy, Colonel Roy Stewart, and several other chiefs,\r\nfollowed Lord George Murray into the town. On the ensuing day Charles\r\nand most of the army entered it. All were disappointed not to overtake\r\nthe enemy; and Lord George Murray has left on record proofs of his\r\nbitter disappointment at the fruitless issue of this gallant encounter,\r\nmuch of which he attributes to want of decision and arrangement. Early\r\non the morning of the battle, he had given the Prince a scroll of the\r\nline of battle, which was approved; he had requested that it might be\r\nfilled in with the names of officers appointed to command. \"I never,\" he\r\nobserves, \"heard that there was any appointment made that day.\" When it\r\nwas agreed to march towards the enemy between twelve and one, he asked\r\nthe Prince whether, since there was no other Lieutenant-General there,\r\nhe should march at the head of the army? He was answered in the\r\naffirmative, after which he never received any other instructions until\r\nthe action was over. The difficulties which Lord George had, therefore,\r\nto encounter, without knowing who were to command in the different\r\nstations; with only two aides-de-camp, both on foot, whilst his personal\r\nenemies were near the Prince in the time of the action, and did little\r\nto advise or suggest, are strongly insisted upon in his narrative. \"I\r\nbelieve,\" he adds, after firmly but dispassionately stating all these\r\nunhappy mistakes, \"that my conduct was unexceptionable, and that in the\r\nadvantages we gained I had a considerable share.\"[165]\r\n\r\nThe day succeeding the victory of Falkirk was passed by the insurgents\r\nin burying the slain, and in collecting the spoils. A deep pit was dug\r\nby the country people, into which the English soldiers and the Highland\r\nclansmen were precipitated into one common grave. The former were easily\r\ndistinguished by the frightful gashes of the broad-swords on their\r\nbreasts and limbs. The tomb contained a heap of human bodies; and long\r\nafter the event the spot of this rude sepulchre might be traced by a\r\ndeep hollow in the field.[166]\r\n\r\nCharles Edward had now arrived at another crisis of his singular\r\ndestiny. The fate of a single day had once more rendered him victorious,\r\nbut it requires a superior and matured judgment to profit by success.\r\n\"One thing is certain,\" remarks an eye-witness of this contest, and that\r\nis, \"that the vanquished will always have great resources in the\r\nnegligence of the victorious party.\"\r\n\r\nThe battle of Falkirk struck terror into every English heart, and the\r\npanic of the Black Monday again spread like a contagion throughout the\r\ncountry. After the retreat from Derby, the higher ranks of society in\r\nEngland, who had betrayed an unwonted degree of alarm, concluded that\r\nthey had nothing more to fear even from \"a band of men so desperately\r\nbrave who had done so much with such little means.\" The victory at\r\nFalkirk was, therefore, received with redoubled alarm; and at court,\r\nduring a ball which was held instantly after the event, only two persons\r\nappeared with calm and cheerful countenances. These were the King, whose\r\npersonal courage was undoubted, and General Cope, who rejoiced that\r\nHawley's failure might in some measure excuse his own.[167]\r\n\r\nUnder these circumstances, and being assured that the panic in Edinburgh\r\nequalled that in London, Prince Charles was strongly advised to repair\r\nto Edinburgh and to resume the possession of the capital. He hesitated,\r\nand the delay proved fatal to his interests. There was no time to be\r\nlost;--the conduct of Hawley had inspired universal contempt not only\r\nfor his abilities, but for his cowardice. \"General Hawley,\" wrote\r\nGeneral Wightman to Duncan Forbes, \"is much in the same situation as\r\nGeneral Cope, and was never seen in the field during the battle; and\r\neverything would have gone to wreck in a worse manner than at Preston,\r\nif General Huske had not acted with judgment and courage, and appeared\r\neverywhere.\"\r\n\r\nLord George Murray remained at Falkirk with the Clans until apprised,\r\nthrough the secretary Murray, that the Duke of Cumberland was expected\r\nat Edinburgh on the twenty-eighth of the month; and that it was\r\nCharles's intention to attack him as soon as he arrived at Falkirk. At\r\nthe first news of the project, Lord George seemed to approve of it; he\r\ndrew up a plan of the battle, which he submitted to the ardent young\r\nChevalier, who was delighted to think that he was to have to oppose the\r\nDuke of Cumberland in person. But this hope was transient; for on the\r\nvery same evening, a representation, signed at Falkirk, by Lord George\r\nMurray and all the commanders of Clans, begging him to retreat, was\r\npresented to the disappointed and indignant Charles Edward. The great\r\ndesertions which were daily taking place since the battle, was made the\r\nchief plea of this unexpected address; two thousand men, it was alleged,\r\nhad gone off since that action, whilst the army of the enemy was\r\nreinforced. Some of the battalions were said to be one-third weaker than\r\nbefore the engagement at Falkirk.\r\n\r\nThe Prince received this address with a dissatisfaction even more\r\napparent than that which he had shown at Derby, when persuaded to\r\nretreat. He dashed his head against the wall with violence, exclaiming,\r\n\"Good God! have I lived to see this?\" As the event showed, it had\r\nperhaps been wiser to have risked the event of an action at that time,\r\nthan to have awaited the mournful catastrophe of Culloden. At length,\r\nalthough he never could be brought to approve of the step, Charles gave\r\na reluctant and sorrowful consent to that which all his chieftains\r\ncalled upon him to adopt. The burden of the censure which was afterwards\r\ncast upon this decision, was thrown upon the Lieutenant-General. \"I was\r\ntold,\" writes Lord George, \"that I was much blamed for it. I really\r\ncannot tell who was the first that spoke of it, but this I am sure,\r\nevery one of us were unanimously of the same opinion.\" The siege of\r\nStirling had proved, indeed, wholly unsuccessful; that very morning the\r\nbattery, although it had been long in preparation, was silenced in a few\r\nhours after it began to play. It was therefore determined to abandon it;\r\nand it was decided that the time of the army would be more profitably\r\nemployed in driving Lord Loudon from Inverness, and in taking the forts\r\nin the north, than in a rash engagement, or a hopeless siege. The spirit\r\nof the enterprise was, indeed, gone; otherwise such a retreat could\r\nnever have been proposed and entertained. It was, however, fully\r\ndetermined on. The deepest dejection prevailed among the army when it\r\nwas announced.\r\n\r\nThe Prince still remained at Bannockburn. On the thirty-first of the\r\nmonth it was determined to have a general review of the troops; the\r\nretreat was not to begin until ten o'clock. Early in the morning Charles\r\nEdward, still hoping that the desertions were not so numerous as had\r\nbeen represented, and that the \"odious retreat\" might be prevented, came\r\nout to view his troops. There was hardly the appearance of an army to\r\nreceive him. On hearing the decision of the Prince, the men had risen at\r\nday-break and had gone off to the Frews, many of them having arrived by\r\nthat time at that ford. There was nothing to be done; Lord George\r\nMurray, who had now joined the Prince from Falkirk, and who was\r\nquartered with some troops in the town of Stirling, was summoned. The\r\nPrince marched off with some of the chiefs and the few troops he had\r\nwith him, and Lord George brought up the rear. A great portion of the\r\nartillery was left behind; the heaviest pieces being nailed up and\r\nabandoned. The retreat was thus precipitately commenced, and presented a\r\nvery different aspect to the withdrawal of the Prince's troops from\r\nDerby.\r\n\r\nOf this disorderly and disreputable march, Lord George Murray knew\r\nnothing until it was begun. The very morning on which it took place, the\r\nchurch of St. Ninian's, where the powder was lodged, was blown up. Lord\r\nGeorge Murray was in his quarters when he heard the great noise of the\r\nexplosion, and thought it was a firing from the Castle. \"My surprise,\"\r\nhe thus writes, \"is not to be expressed.[168] I knew no enemy was even\r\ncome the length of Falkirk; so that, except the garrison of Stirling\r\nCastle, nothing could hurt us. I imagined they had sallied, and made the\r\nconfusion I observed. I shall say no more about this; a particular\r\naccount of it is wrote. I believe the like of it never was heard of.\"\r\n\r\nThe destruction of St. Ninian's tower is attributed by most historians\r\nto the awkwardness of the Highlanders, in attempting to destroy their\r\nammunition. \"I am apt to think it was an accident,\" observes Maxwell,\r\n\"or, at least, the design of some very private person, for there was no\r\nwarning given to any body to get out of the way. Nine or ten country\r\npeople, and five of the Jacobite soldiers, perished from the explosion;\r\nand the Prince, over whose existence a special Providence appeared to\r\nhave watched, was within being hurt when the explosion took place.\"[169]\r\n\r\nThe Highland army was quartered on the first night of their march at\r\nDoune and Dumblain; and assembled the next day at Crieff. Here Charles\r\nEdward again reviewed them, and to his surprise found that they had\r\nmostly re-assembled, and that scarcely a thousand of the troops were\r\nwanting. The young Prince, who had reluctantly consented to the retreat\r\nupon the supposition that he had lost one half of his army, reproached\r\nLord George Murray with having advised that step. Many were the censures\r\nheaped upon the General for his councils; and it must be acknowledged,\r\nthat the caution apparent in his character was, in this instance,\r\ncarried to an extreme. He excused himself on the plea of his opinion\r\nhaving been that of the whole army; but exonerated himself from any\r\nparticipation in the sudden departure, or, as he calls it, \"the flight\"\r\nfrom Stirling. At the council which was then called, heats and\r\nanimosities rose to a height which had never before been witnessed, even\r\namong the vehement and discordant advisers of the Prince. After many\r\nfierce altercations, it was determined that Prince Charles should march\r\nto Inverness by the Highland road; and that Lord George Murray, with his\r\nhorse, and the low country regiments, should proceed along the coast\r\nroad, by Montrose and Aberdeen to the same place.\r\n\r\nDuring the last few months the Marquis of Tullibardine had been\r\nstationary, employing himself in the fruitless endeavour to stimulate\r\nthe tenantry and the neighbourhood to join the army of Charles Edward.\r\nAfter leaving Bannockburn he remained at Polmaise, a small village in\r\nStirlingshire, until urged by Lord George to repair to Blair Castle, to\r\ngarrison that place; for which purpose, according to his opinion, a body\r\nof fifty men would be sufficient. In his letters to his brother, Lord\r\nGeorge recommends a degree of severity towards deserters which was not\r\nconsonant with the mild temper of Tullibardine: \"Those who have gone\r\nhome without a special licence on furlough, must be exemplarily\r\npunished, either in their persons or effects, or in both; for when our\r\nall depends, lenity would be folly.\" After urging the Marquis to send\r\noff the men to Blair by dozens, he adds, \"If rewards and punishments do\r\nnot, I know not what will. By the laws of God and man you have both in\r\nyour power and your person:\" thus alluding to the Marquis's position as\r\na chief.\r\n\r\nBut these decisive measures were impracticable. \"I was ordered by the\r\nDuke of Atholl\" writes David Robertson from Blair, to his brother, an\r\nofficer in Lord George's regiment, \"to take up and imprison all\r\ndeserters; but I might as well attempt to move a mountain, being left\r\nhere without money, or men capable of being made officers.\" Nor was the\r\nMarquis's power more effectual. The most sincere desire to comply with\r\nevery wish or counsel of Lord George Murray's, actuated, indeed, this\r\nestimable man. He seems, from his letters, to have felt the most\r\nunbounded and affectionate admiration for his brother; a sentiment only\r\ninferior to his devotion to the Prince; yet we can perceive a covert\r\nallusion in some of his injunctions to those frequent disagreements with\r\nCharles, of which the Marquis was probably not ignorant. \"Pray, take\r\ncare of our young master's glory as well as your own, and the King's\r\nservice, which ought to be dear to all honest men who are above selfish\r\nviews. Excuse me,\" adds the aged nobleman, whose anxieties and\r\nsufferings were soon to close in a prison, \"for not writing with my own\r\nhand; since seeing you, excessive rheumatick pains has rendered it\r\nalmost impossible.\"\r\n\r\nBy Robertson of Strowan, a man noted for his eccentricities, a very\r\ngloomy view was taken of the proceedings of the generals and courtiers\r\nwho surrounded Charles. He was ordered by the Prince to stay at home,\r\nand to stop all the deserters who came in his way. He obeyed the\r\ncommand; but obeyed with the observation, that \"all were running to the\r\ndevil, except the Duke of Atholl and the Laird of Strowan.\" He hinted in\r\nhis letters, that he could disclose much to the \"Duke,\" respecting his\r\nnearest relations, both as to their dislike to himself, and their\r\ndisrespect to his Grace. The friendly intercourse between Lord George\r\nand his brother continued, nevertheless, unabated. The former on one\r\noccasion congratulates his brother on the valour of the \"Atholl men,\" at\r\nthe battle of Falkirk. The encomium was answered by the Marquis's\r\ncomplaints of the sad change in the spirit and loyalty of the Clan since\r\nthe defection of their \"unnatural brother James\" from the Stuart cause.\r\nNothing but vexations and disappointments occurred to the Marquis on his\r\nreturn to Blair. His rents were refused by his tenants on account of\r\ntheir expenditure in the Prince's service, and the country around Perth\r\nwas left exposed to the enemy. For some time entreaties from Lord George\r\nto his brother, that he would send men to replace those who were killed\r\nat Falkirk of the Atholl men, were met by excuses too well grounded in\r\nreason. All the \"corners of the country\" were searched by the Marquis's\r\nagent, to raise the men in an \"amicable way,\" but without avail. The\r\nexertions of poor Tullibardine, nevertheless, continued indefatigable,\r\nnotwithstanding the truly Scottish complaints, sciatica and rheumatic\r\npains. \"I omit,\" he writes, \"nothing that lies in my power that can\r\ncontribute towards the public service. God knows what dilatory and\r\nimposing evasions one has to struggle with amid a multitude of\r\nrefractory people in these parts.\" At length the sum of three hundred\r\npounds was sent to him by Secretary Murray in order to maintain the\r\nrecruits whom he had raised on his own estates.\r\n\r\nEventually the seeds of dissension were sown between Lord George Murray\r\nand his brother. Nor can we wonder, however we may grieve, at such an\r\nevent. The aim of the one was personal glory, fame. The whole heart of\r\nthe other was centred in the success of the cause. When he suspected\r\nthat the intentions of that brother, of whom he was so proud, were less\r\ndisinterested than his own, a mild, but earnest and mournful reproof was\r\nwrung from his kind and trusting heart.[170]\r\n\r\nUntil, however, the seat of war was transferred to the paternal home of\r\nLord George Murray--whilst his immediate interests were spared--the\r\nMarquis of Tullibardine evinced the most sincere confidence in his\r\nintentions, and admiration for his talents. Afterwards, suspicions,\r\nwhich have been in a great measure dissipated by the testimony of brave\r\nand honourable men, might disturb the repose, but could not,\r\neventually, sully the fame of Lord George Murray. In thus reverting to\r\nthe domestic concerns of this celebrated man, the position of his lady\r\nand children naturally recur. Lady George Murray had resided during the\r\ntroubles of 1745 at Tullibardine, in the parish of Blackford, in\r\nPerthshire. The castle of Tullibardine had been fortified by a portion\r\nof the Earl of Mar's army in 1715: but was taken by the Earl of Argyle.\r\nUntil after the close of the last insurrection it was inhabited by Lady\r\nGeorge Murray; but when the fate of her husband was involved in the\r\ngeneral wreck, the old building was suffered to fall to ruin. From this\r\nresidence, such of Lady George Murray's letters to her husband as are\r\npreserved in the Atholl correspondence are dated. They are chiefly\r\naddressed to the Marquis of Tullibardine, and form the medium of\r\ncorrespondence between him and his brother. Here, too, she gave birth,\r\nafter the battle of Falkirk, to a daughter named Katherine; and during\r\nthe confinement which followed this event, her Ladyship's office as\r\ncorrespondent was fulfilled by her young daughter, who bore the name of\r\nAmelia. To the letter of this child, Lord Tullibardine replies with his\r\naccustomed courtesy and kindly feeling. \"With extreme satisfaction I\r\nreceived,\" he says, \"a mighty well wrote letter from you, which could\r\nnot but charm me with your endearing merit. I rejoice in being able to\r\ncongratulate your mother and you on the glorious share my brother George\r\nhas again had in the fresh victory which Providence has given the Prince\r\nRegent over his proud Hanoverian enemies! Dear child, I thank you kindly\r\nfor enquiring after my health.\" To these near, and, as it appears,\r\ncherished ties, Lord George was probably re-united during the march to\r\nCrieff. But whatever of domestic happiness he may have enjoyed, its\r\nduration was transient; and he passed on to a service full of the\r\nhardships of war, but in which he was doomed never more to possess the\r\nlaurels of victory.\r\n\r\nFrom Crieff, Lord George Murray marched to Perth, and thence by Montrose\r\nand Aberdeen to Inverness. During the inclemency of the winter many of\r\nthe cavalry lost their horses; but the troopers being, as Sir Walter\r\nrelates, \"chiefly gentlemen, continued to adhere with fidelity to their\r\nill-omened standards.\"[171]\r\n\r\nA storm of snow rendered the march from Aberdeen both dangerous and\r\ntedious. Lord George had above three hundred carriages of artillery to\r\nconvey, although a great portion of the artillery was sunk in the river\r\nTay, at Perth. In forming a junction at Inverness, the Prince had three\r\nobjects in view--to reduce Fort-William and Fort-Augustus, on one side;\r\non the other to disperse the army with which Lord Loudon had opposed him\r\nin the north; lastly, to keep possession of the east coast, from which\r\nquarter reinforcements and supplies were expected to arrive from France.\r\nIt was, therefore, decided that Lord George Murray should continue along\r\nthe eastern coast, in order to intercept Lord Loudon's army, in case it\r\ncame that way. On the sixteenth of February he crossed the river Spey,\r\nand proceeded by Elgin, Forres, and Nairn, to Culloden, where he arrived\r\nthe day before the castle of Inverness surrendered to Charles. Lord\r\nGeorge Murray then gave the Prince an account of his march, of which\r\neven this hardy General speaks as of a journey of inconceivable trouble\r\nand fatigue. Here discussions took place, in which, as usual, the Prince\r\ndiffered in some important points from his Lieutenant-General. The plan\r\nwhich Lord George proposed was, to procure five thousand bolls of meal\r\nin Bamff, Murray, and Nairn, laying a tax in an equal manner on these\r\nseveral shires, and to send this supply to the Highlands; so that in\r\ncase the Duke of Cumberland, who was now proceeding northwards, should\r\nfollow them thither, they could have subsistence. To this scheme Charles\r\nobjected; and the meal was lodged in Inverness. His confidence in his\r\nGeneral, notwithstanding the incessant displays of his ability, was now\r\nwholly undermined. Charles's affairs were indeed rapidly declining;\r\nmoney, the principal sinew of war, was wanting. \"His little stock might\r\nhave held out a little longer,\" observes Mr. Maxwell, \"had it been well\r\nmanaged; but it is more than probable that his principal steward was a\r\nthief from the beginning.\" The Secretary Murray, against whom this\r\ncharge is levelled, was not, perhaps, more faithless when he\r\nappropriated to himself the funds of his unfortunate master, than when\r\nhe planted in the breast of Charles, misgivings of his friends, and\r\nabused his influence to mislead a confiding nature. There was, however,\r\nno proof against Murray of Broughton of dishonesty, \"but there were very\r\nstrong presumptions; and his underlings, who suspected that their\r\nopportunity would not last long, made the best of it, and filled their\r\npockets with the public money.\"[172]\r\n\r\nBy the officers and soldiers at Culloden, Lord George was received with\r\njoy. They regretted his absence, and were pleased to say that had he\r\nbeen with them they should have \"given a good account of Lord Loudon and\r\nhis troops, whom they had been prevented from pursuing at Inverness.\"\r\nLord George soon found that these professions were sincere. The Prince\r\nwas induced to send him to Dingwall, that he might assist the Earl of\r\nCromartie in pursuing Lord Loudon, who had passed up to Tain. This\r\nscheme having proved impracticable, he returned to Inverness.\r\n\r\nMeantime the county of Atholl suffered under the unparalleled cruelties\r\nof the English soldiery. The Duke of Cumberland had visited that\r\ninteresting district; and it requires little more to be said, to\r\ncomprehend that beauty was turned to desolation; that crimes hitherto\r\nunheard of among a British army reflected dishonour on the conquerors,\r\nand brought misery to the conquered. On the sixth of February, 1746, the\r\nDuke had arrived at Perth. His first orders were to seize the Duchess of\r\nPerth, the mother of the Duke, and the Viscountess Strathallan, and to\r\ncarry them to a small, wretched prison in Edinburgh, where they remained\r\nnearly a year. The Duke of Cumberland was succeeded at Edinburgh by his\r\nbrother-in-law, the Prince of Hesse, who had landed at Leith with five\r\nthousand infantry and five hundred huzzars in the pay of England. These\r\nwere stationed in the capital, ready to swarm into the country to subdue\r\nits brave inhabitants.\r\n\r\nWhilst Lord George Murray was still at Inverness, he heard that his\r\ncherished home, the territory of his proud forefathers, the scenes of\r\nhis youth, were ravaged by a detachment of Cumberland's army. The houses\r\nof such gentlemen as had assisted Prince Charles were burned; and their\r\nfamilies, after receiving every species of indignity that could palliate\r\nthe guilt of a future revenge, and that could break honest hearts, were\r\nturned out to perish on the hills with cold and hunger. The very nature\r\nof Englishmen appears to have been changed during this most mournful,\r\nmost disgraceful warfare; and never did the British army sink so low in\r\nmorals, in humanity, as during the German yoke of a Prince whom one\r\nrejects as a countryman.[173]\r\n\r\nLord George was instantly ordered to go to Atholl. Little could he\r\nsuspect the construction afterwards placed on his conduct, and the snare\r\nwhich was laid for him by his enemies, in the events of the next few\r\nweeks.\r\n\r\nLord George marched with unheard of dispatch towards Atholl. Already had\r\nthe Duke of Cumberland placed at different parts, in that district,\r\nbands of the Argyleshire Campbells, to the amount of three hundred in\r\nnumber. A thousand more, it was reported, were coming from the same\r\nquarter; and it was Lord George's aim to intercept this reinforcement.\r\nHe set off, followed by his brave \"Atholl-men,\" conducting his march\r\nthrough byeways across the mountains; and in one march, day and night,\r\nhe traversed a tract of thirty miles. It was, however, impossible to\r\ntransport cannon through these almost impassable solitudes; yet, with a\r\nforce not exceeding seven hundred men, Lord George contrived to surprise\r\nthe enemy at these posts. He entered Atholl in the early part of the\r\nnight; his detachment then separated, and, dividing itself into small\r\nparties, each gentleman whose home had been invaded took the shortest\r\nroad to his own house. The English soldiers were surprised in their\r\nsleep, and, according to the Chevalier Johnstone, lay murdered in their\r\nbeds; but this is contradicted by many authorities.[174] These Highland\r\ngentlemen attacked, during that night, thirty of the posts in question,\r\nand all of them were carried. Few of the Government troops were put to\r\nthe sword; about three hundred were taken prisoners, and between two and\r\nthree hundred barricaded themselves in the Castle of Blair.[175]\r\n\r\nThe Marquis of Tullibardine had, it appears, been driven from that\r\nfortress some time previously. Misfortune was not new to one who had\r\njoined in the insurrection of 1715.\r\n\r\n\"As the late Rothiemurcus,[176] your father,\" he writes to a\r\nfriend,[177] in a letter to which he dared not even state his place of\r\nresidence, \"showed me particular friendship and kindness on just such an\r\nunfortunate occasion as the present, makes me hope you will have no less\r\nregard for me in taking care of some small concerns of mine; which\r\nconsists in taking care of two of three of my servants and some\r\nbaggage, which I send you, rather than it should fall into enemies'\r\nhands; so that if you cannot keep it, and get it sent me in time and\r\nplace convenient, it may be of some use to yourself, whom I esteem on\r\nyour family and father's account; though we have not had the occasion of\r\na personal acquaintance, which I hope may yet agreeably happen, in\r\nwhatever bad situation our affairs may at present appear; then I may\r\nagreeably be able to return you suitable thanks for such an obligation\r\nas will for ever oblige,\r\n\r\n                         \"Sir,\r\n                   \"Your affectionate humble servant and cousin,\r\n                                                           \"ATHOLL.\"\r\n\r\n14th March, 1746.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe Clan of Atholl was the largest that engaged in Prince Charles's\r\nservice, and numbered nearly fifteen hundred men. Lord George now\r\ncollected three hundred more of these vassals, and invested Blair\r\nCastle. One difficulty he had in the deficiency of cannon; he obtained,\r\nhowever, some field-pieces from Inverness, but his artillery was too\r\nlight to make an impression on the walls. There was an alternative,\r\nwhich was, to reduce the castle by famine. Blair, as it happened, was\r\ndefended by a stout and sturdy veteran, Sir Andrew Agnew, who was\r\nresolved only to yield upon extreme necessity his important charge.\r\nDuring the siege, Lord George wrote on the subject of the enterprise to\r\nhis brother the Marquis of Tullibardine. The letter was answered in a\r\nmanner which shows that some want of candour had been evinced towards\r\nthe Marquis, who was regarded by all the Jacobites as the legitimate\r\nowner of Blair. The epistle breathes the tone of mournful resentment.\r\n\"Since, contrary to the rules of right reason, you have been pleased to\r\ntell me a sham story about the expedition to Blair,\" such are the\r\nexpressions used by the Marquis of Tullibardine, \"you may now do what\r\nthe gentlemen of that country wish with the castle.\"[178] With the true\r\nvalue of a high-born man for the memorials of his ancestors, the Marquis\r\ngrieved most for the loss of his great-great-grandfather's\r\ngrandfather's, and father's pictures. \"They will be ane irreparable\r\nloss.\" But every thing that could promote the public service was to be\r\nresigned cheerfully and willingly for that cause. Not only did he\r\nproffer the sacrifice of his castle, but he pointed out to his brother a\r\ngate which had formerly been a portcullis, leading into it. This was at\r\nthat time half-built up, and boarded, with a hollow large enough to hold\r\na horse at rack and manger; and the Marquis suggested that this place\r\nmight be more easily penetrated than any other part of the wall, so as\r\nto make an entrance into the vaulted room called \"the Servants' Hall.\"\r\n\r\nWhether or not Lord George decided to take advantage of this hint is\r\nunknown. The attack made upon the Castle of Blair was conducted by him\r\nin person, and was begun simultaneously with those headed by his\r\nfollowers upon the various posts at Blairfitty, Kinachie side, and\r\nseveral places near Blair. Upon the persons of the prisoners were found\r\ncopies of their orders from the Duke of Cumberland, and these were\r\nsigned by Colonel Campbell, and contained instructions to attack the\r\nrebels wherever they should meet them; and in case of resistance, it was\r\nthe Duke's orders that _they should get no quarter_.[179] Stimulated by\r\nthese intercepted documents, Lord George, early on the morning of the\r\neighteenth of March, began the siege of Blair.\r\n\r\nMany have been the accounts given, and various are the surmises upon the\r\nmotives of Lord George in not reducing the castle; but in estimating the\r\nreal difficulties of his undertaking, the testimony of a soldier and a\r\ncontemporary must be taken in evidence.\r\n\r\nBlair was defended by a man of no ordinary character, Sir Andrew Agnew,\r\nLieutenant-Colonel of the Royal North British Fusiliers, who had been\r\nsent with a detachment from Perth by the route of Dunkeld, through the\r\npass of Killicrankie, to take possession of the Castle.\r\n\r\nWhen Sir Andrew first posted himself in Blair no apprehensions of a\r\nblockade were entertained; and no fear of a supply of provisions being\r\ncut off was suggested. The quantity of garrison provisions sent into it\r\nwas therefore extremely small, as was also the store of ammunition. In\r\nregard to water, the garrison were in a better condition. A draw-well in\r\nthe castle supplied them after the blockade: previously, the inhabitants\r\nhad usually fetched the water they required from a neighbouring barn or\r\nbrook, which formed itself into a pool in front of the house.[180]\r\n\r\nBlair Castle was then an irregular and very high building, with walls\r\nof great thickness, having a great tower, called Cumming's Tower,\r\nprojecting from the west end of the front of the house, which faces the\r\nnorth. This tower could be defended by musket shot from its windows.\r\n\r\nAdjoining to the eastern gavel of the old house a new building had been\r\nbegun, but had only been carried up a few feet at the time of the siege.\r\nSince the year 1745, great alterations have been made in this building,\r\nwhich has been lowered and modernized, and the Cumming's Tower wholly\r\ntaken away.\r\n\r\nIt was between nine and ten in the morning when Lord George Murray\r\nappeared before Blair Castle, and planted his men so as to prevent the\r\ngarrison from sallying out, or from getting in provisions.[181] The\r\ncastle was soon so completely invested by the advanced guard of the\r\nJacobites, that they fired from behind the nearest walls and enclosures\r\nat the picket guard of the besieged. Some horses were hurriedly taken\r\ninto the Castle with a small quantity of provender; and in such haste,\r\nthat one of these animals was put into the lower part of Cumming's Tower\r\nwithout forage or water.\r\n\r\nThere was a great entrance and staircase on the east side of the Castle;\r\nthis was now barricaded, and a small guard placed near it; the garrison,\r\nconsisting of two hundred and seventy men, were then parcelled out into\r\ndifferent chambers, with a charge not to fire until actually attacked. A\r\nsort of platform was laid over the new building of the Castle, and an\r\nensign with a guard of twenty-five soldiers placed on this to defend\r\nthat part from serving as a lodgement to the besiegers. There was also a\r\nguard placed over the draw-well, to prevent the water being drawn up\r\nexcept at a certain hour in the morning. Besides the garrison, there\r\nwere within the Castle, about seven servants of the Duke of Atholl's;\r\nnamely, a land steward, a female housekeeper, three maid servants, a\r\ngardener, and a gamekeeper.\r\n\r\nLord George Murray having established his quarters in the village of\r\nBlair, about a quarter of a mile from the north of the castle, soon sent\r\ndown a summons to Sir Andrew Agnew, Bart. to surrender, intimating that\r\n\"he should answer to the contrary at his peril.\"\r\n\r\nNow Sir Andrew was reputed to be a man of an outrageous temper; and the\r\nHighlanders, who could face the Duke of Cumberland's dragoons, shrank\r\nfrom encountering the sturdy, imperious old soldier. The only person,\r\ntherefore, who could be prevailed upon to carry the summons, was a\r\nmaid-servant from the inn at Blair, who being a comely Highland girl,\r\nand acquainted with some of the soldiers, conceived herself to be on so\r\nfriendly a footing with them that she might encounter the risk. The\r\nsummons was written on a very dirty piece of paper; and corresponded\r\nwell with the appearance of the herald who conveyed it. Provided with\r\nthis, the young woman set out; as she approached the Castle, she waived\r\nthe summons over her head several times, and drawing near one of the\r\nwindows on the basement story, made herself heard. She was received by\r\nthe officers with boisterous mirth; they assured her that they should\r\nsoon visit the village, and her master's house, again, and drive away\r\nthe Highlanders. But, when entreated by the girl to take her into Sir\r\nAndrew's presence, they all at first refused; at last the summons was\r\nreluctantly conveyed to the commandant by a lieutenant more venturesome\r\nthan the rest. This emissary soon, however, fled from the presence of\r\nthe baronet, who broke out with the most vehement expressions of rage on\r\nreading the contents of the paper; uttered strong epithets against Lord\r\nGeorge Murray, and threatened to shoot any messenger who might dare to\r\nconvey any future communication.\r\n\r\nThe young girl returned to Blair. As she drew near the village, she\r\nperceived Lord George Murray, Lord Nairn, Clunie Macpherson and other\r\nofficers standing in the churchyard of Blair; and observed that they\r\nwere evidently diverted by her errand, and its result.[182]\r\n\r\nFrom that time Lord George Murray made no attempt to hold any parley\r\nwith the garrison, but continued to blockade the Castle. His men were\r\neven posted close up against the walls, wherever they could not be\r\nannoyed with the musketry; particularly at that part on which the\r\nscaffold guard was placed, where they stood, heaving up stones from time\r\nto time, and uttering their jokes against the veteran, Sir Andrew\r\nAgnew.[183]\r\n\r\n\"The cannon,\" as Lord George Murray observes in his narrative, \"were not\r\nonly small, but bad. One of them seldom hit the Castle, though not\r\nhalf-musket shot from it.\"\r\n\r\nVarious schemes were formed by Lord George during this siege, but many\r\nobstacles concurred to check them. It had indeed been proposed before\r\nLord George left Inverness, to blow up Blair Castle; but not only had\r\nLord George no orders to attempt that, but there seemed also to be a\r\ndifficulty from the situation of the place.\r\n\r\nIt appeared at one time his intention, also, to have set the building on\r\nfire. \"On the eighteenth,\" writes Lord Elcho, \"Lord George began to fire\r\nagainst the Castle with two four pounders; and as he had a furnace along\r\nwith him, finding his bullets were too small to damage the walls, he\r\nendeavoured by firing red hot balls to set the house on fire, and\r\nseveral times set the roof on fire, but by the care of the besieged it\r\nwas always extinguished. A constant fire of small arms was kept against\r\nthe windows, and the besieged kept a close fire from the castle with\r\ntheir small arms.\" \"As the castle,\" continues the same writer, \"is\r\nsituated upon rocky ground, there was no blowing it up; so the only\r\nchance Lord George had to get possession of it was to starve it, which\r\nhe had some hopes of, as there were so many mouths in it.\" From this\r\nopinion, the judgment of Lord George Murray, in some measure, differed.\r\n\"It might, I believe,\" he says, \"have been entered by the old stables,\r\nunder protection of which the wall could have been undermined, if I had\r\nbeen furnished with proper workmen.\" But all his efforts, in both these\r\nschemes, proved ineffectual. The red hot balls lodging in the solid\r\ntimbers of the roof, only charred, and did not ignite the beams; and\r\nfalling down, were caught up in iron ladles brought out of the Duke of\r\nAtholl's kitchen, and thrown into water. Disappointed in this attempt,\r\nLord George removed his few field-pieces to a nearer position on the\r\nsouth side of the Castle, where, however, his firing produced no better\r\neffect than heretofore.\r\n\r\nNever was there an officer more insensible to fear than the defender of\r\nBlair. Whilst Lord George was thus ineffectually battering the walls of\r\nthe house, Sir Andrew Agnew looked out over the battlements; and seeing\r\nthe little impression that was made on the walls, he exclaimed, \"Hout! I\r\ndaresay the man's mad, knocking down his own brother's house.\"\r\n\r\nMeantime the siege lasted nearly a fortnight, and the garrison were\r\nreduced to the greatest extremity for provisions. One hope, however, the\r\ncommandant had, and that was of sallying forth, and escaping. The Castle\r\nof Menzies was then occupied by Colonel Webster, who was posted there in\r\norder to secure the passage of the river Tay; and, as an alternative to\r\nstarvation, a scheme was suggested for stealing out from Blair in the\r\nnight time, and marching through a mountainous part of country to join\r\nthe king's troops at Castle Menzies.\r\n\r\nWhilst this project was in contemplation, the brave garrison were\r\nthreatened with a new danger. During the blockade, there was heard a\r\nnoise of knocking, seemingly beneath the floor of the Castle, as if\r\nminers were at work in its deep vaults, to blow it up. All the inmates\r\nof Blair thought such must indeed be the case: for Lord George had now\r\ngained possession of a bowling-green near the Castle, and also of a\r\nhouse in which the bowls were kept: from this bowl-house a subterranean\r\npassage might easily have been dug to the very centre of the ground\r\nunderneath the building, and a chamber or mine formed there for holding\r\nbarrels of gunpowder, sufficient to complete the work of destruction.\r\nThis scheme must have occurred to the mind of Lord George Murray, who\r\nwas born at Blair, and well acquainted with its construction. His\r\nobjections to pursue it appear, as has been stated, to have been\r\nperceived and controverted by the Marquis of Tullibardine. They arose,\r\nas he has himself declared, and as the English also appear to have\r\nconsidered, from his want of workmen to perform the attempt. The plan of\r\nundermining was not thought practicable; and the noise which so greatly\r\nalarmed the garrison was proved to be only the reverberation of strokes\r\nof an axe with which a soldier was cutting a block of wood which lay on\r\nthe floor of one of the uppermost rooms. The most unfavourable\r\nsuspicions were, however, eventually affixed to Lord George's neglect of\r\nthis mode of attack. Whether such conduct proceeded, on his part, from\r\nan aversion to destroy the home of his youth, and his birthplace;\r\nwhether he had still hopes of reducing Sir Andrew to capitulate; or\r\nwhether, as it has been often vaguely asserted, a secret agreement\r\nexisted between himself and James, Duke of Atholl, that the Castle\r\nshould be saved, can only be determined by a far closer insight into\r\nmotives than human power can obtain. We may accord to Lord George\r\nMurray, without a blemish on his fidelity, a pardonable reluctance to\r\nlevel to the dust the pride of his family; that every effort was made to\r\nsubdue Blair, except the last, is evident from the testimony of all\r\ncontemporary historians.\r\n\r\nMeantime the garrison had one source of confidence in their extremity,\r\non which sailors are more apt to reckon than landsmen. They trusted to\r\nthe _luck_ of their commandant. Never had the stout veteran who had\r\nfought, in 1706, at Ramilies, been either sick, or wounded. He had never\r\nbeen in any battle that the English did not win. Yet it was deemed\r\nprudent not to allow any means of aid to be neglected, in so pressing a\r\ndanger as the state of the siege presented.\r\n\r\nThe Earl of Crawford was then supposed to be at Dunkeld, having the\r\ncommand both of the British troops and of a body of Hessians who had\r\nlately been marched from Edinburgh. It was resolved to send to that\r\nnobleman for aid. The Duke of Atholl's gardener, a man named Wilson,\r\nundertook that dangerous embassy; he was charged with a letter from Sir\r\nAndrew to the Earl, and was allowed to take his choice of any horse in\r\nthe Castle.[184]\r\n\r\nBefore Sir Andrew and his starving garrison could gain intelligence of\r\nthe fate of Wilson, or could have heard the result of his enterprise, a\r\nstrange reverse in their affairs took place. On the morning of the first\r\nof April, not a single Highlander was to be seen by any of the guards on\r\nduty. All had vanished; and a visit from the young woman from the inn at\r\nBlair shortly followed their disappearance. From her, the garrison heard\r\nthat Lord George had, in fear of the arrival of troops from Dunkeld,\r\nsuddenly withdrawn with all his followers. The old Sir Andrew,\r\nnevertheless, fearful of some stratagem, would not allow his garrison to\r\nsally out: they were shut up until the following day, when the Earl of\r\nCrawford appeared before the castle, and relieved all fears. The\r\nofficers and soldiers were then drawn out, with Sir Andrew at the head\r\nof it. \"My Lord,\" cried the old soldier, \"I am very glad to see you;\r\nbut, _by all that's good_, you are come too late, and we have nothing to\r\ngive you to eat!\" To which Lord Crawford answered courteously; and\r\nlaughing, begged of Sir Andrew to partake of such provisions as he had\r\nbrought with him. That day Sir Andrew and the Earl, and their officers,\r\ndined in the summer-house of the garden at Blair, in high spirits at the\r\nresult of the siege.\r\n\r\nThe disappearance of Lord George Murray was soon explained; nor can the\r\nstatement of those reasons which induced him to abandon the siege of\r\nBlair be given in a more satisfactory manner than as they were stated by\r\nLord Elcho; to whom they must have appeared satisfactory, otherwise he\r\nwould not have left so clear and decisive a testimony in favour of Lord\r\nGeorge Murray's motives. It is worthy of remark, that Lord Elcho's\r\nstatement agrees in every particular with that addressed some years\r\nafterwards by Lord George to Mr. Murray of Abercairney, and now\r\npreserved in the Jacobite Memoirs by Forbes.[185]\r\n\r\n\"On the twenty-fourth of March, the Hessians from Perth and Crieff moved\r\nto its relief. They encamped the first night at Nairn House, and next\r\nnight at Dunkeld, and there was some firing betwixt them and a party of\r\nLord George's across the river. Those that marched from Crieff encamped\r\nat Tay Bridge on the twenty-seventh. Upon this motion of the Hessians,\r\nLord George sent an express to the Prince, to tell him that if he would\r\nsend twelve hundred men, he would pitch upon an advantageous ground and\r\nfight them. The Prince sent him word he could not send him them in the\r\nway his army was then situated. On the thirty-first the Earl of Crawford\r\nmarched with St. George's Dragoons, five hundred Hessians, and sixty\r\nHussars, and encamped at Dawallie, four miles north of Dunkeld, and next\r\nday they advanced to Pittachrie. Both these days Lord George had several\r\nskirmishes with the hussars; but although he laid several snares for\r\nthem, he never could catch but one of them, who was an officer and a\r\nSwede, who had his horse shot under him. Lord George used him very\r\ncivilly, and sent him back with a letter of compliment which he wrote to\r\nthe Prince of Hesse. On the first of April Lord George Murray drew his\r\nmen up in battle opposite to Lord Crawford at Pittachrie, and then\r\nretreated before him, in order to draw him into the pass of\r\nKillicrankie; but Lord Crawford never moved, but sent for reinforcements\r\nto the Prince of Hesse. Lord George, upon hearing of the march of that\r\nreinforcement to sustain Lord Crawford, and that the body of Hessians\r\nfrom Lay Bridge were marching to Blair by Kinachin, quitted the country\r\nand marched his men to Strathspan, and from thence to Speyside. He\r\nhimself went to Inverness, where he found his enemies had persuaded the\r\nPrince that he might have taken Blair Castle if he had had a mind, but\r\nthat he had spared it because it was his brother's house; and in short\r\nthey made the Prince believe, that in the letter he had wrote to the\r\nPrince of Hesse, he had engaged to betray him the first opportunity; and\r\nthat by the Prince of Hesse and his brother's means, he was entirely\r\nreconciled to the government. What Mr. Murray had insinuated to the\r\nPrince about Lord George, on his first coming to Perth had made such an\r\nimpression, that the Prince always believed it, notwithstanding Lord\r\nGeorge's behaviour was such (especially in action) as to convince the\r\nwhole army of the falsity of such accusations. However it opened his\r\nmind upon the matter of the Irish officers, so far as to make some of\r\nthem promise to watch Lord George's motions, particularly in case of a\r\nbattle, and they promised the Prince to shoot him, if they could find he\r\nintended to betray him.\"\r\n\r\nFrom the following letter addressed by Lord George Murray to his brother\r\nthe Marquis of Tullibardine, it is evident that he had had it in\r\ncontemplation during some time, to abandon the siege of Blair, and that\r\nthe sudden appearance of the body of Hessians six thousand strong,\r\nwithin a day's march of Blair, was not the only cause of his raising a\r\nsiege which every one acknowledges must have terminated in favour of the\r\nbesiegers within a few days.\r\n\r\n                                        \"Blair, 29th of March, 1746.\r\n\r\n    \"Dear Brother,[186]\r\n\r\n    \"I received your letter of the 26th; I am sorry you seem to think I\r\n    told you a sham story (as you express it) about our expedition here.\r\n    I told you we were to endeavour to take possession of Castle Grant,\r\n    and try to hinder that Clan taking party against us; this was done\r\n    so far as in our power. I also told you if we could contrive to\r\n    surprise any of the parties in this country we might attempt it; but\r\n    that depended so much upon incidents, that my very hopes could not\r\n    reach so far as we performed. Secrecy and expedition was our main\r\n    point, once we resolved upon the thing, which was not till I met\r\n    Clunie and Sheen in Badenoch. If the greatest fatigues, dangers, and\r\n    hard duties deserve approbation, I think some thanks are due to us,\r\n    and from none more than yourself; for my own part, I was once\r\n    seventy hours without three of sleep; but we undergo all hardships\r\n    for the good of common cause. You will ever find me, dear brother,\r\n    your most affectionate brother and faithful servant,\r\n\r\n                                                    \"GEORGE MURRAY.\"\r\n\r\n    \"I am so ill supported with men, money, and every thing else, our\r\n    people here have no pay, that after all our endeavours, I'm afraid\r\n    we must abandon this country without the Castle.\"\r\n\r\nThis letter brought the following characteristic reply. It is dated from\r\nInverness, whither the Marquis had repaired.[187]\r\n\r\n    \"Brother George.\r\n\r\n    \"This evening I had yours of yesterday's date. As to any difference\r\n    betwixt you and I, without prejudice to passed expedition and\r\n    secrecy mentioned, at meeting it must be discussed the best way we\r\n    can, since lately behaving according to dutiful sentiments, nobody\r\n    is more satisfied than I am of your indefatigable activity for the\r\n    public service. Had you sent me your letters to the Secretary, who I\r\n    am very sorry to say is at Elgin dangerously ill, or any other of\r\n    the Ministry to whom expresses were addressed, I should have\r\n    directly endeavoured getting the most satisfactory answers could be\r\n    sent your pressing reale demands, which are not well understood if\r\n    much regarded by everybody here; I am informed by Mr. Hay and\r\n    Cruben, who were just now with me, that all the men who were with\r\n    you have been fully paid till Wednesday last; and that with some\r\n    necessary foresight and pains, you might have had a good deal of\r\n    provisions from below the Pass, whilst that expedient was\r\n    practicable; since you might have naturally known that money cannot\r\n    be soon sent from hence, but on an absolute necessity; you know that\r\n    meal can be still brought you from Kiliwhimen. With that I wrote to\r\n    you the twenty-sixth, in case the enemy could not be otherwise\r\n    forced out of my house, I gave Sir Thomas Sheridan an account to be\r\n    sent to you of a secret passage into it, which is here again\r\n    transmitted, in case of making any advantageous use of it has been\r\n    hitherto neglected; was it not hoped by this time you have near got\r\n    the better of these obstinate intruders into the Castle, at any rate\r\n    I should go myself and try if I could not usefully help towards\r\n    reducing them to a speedy surrendering of such unfortified, though\r\n    thick old walls as it is composed of. Pray continue your accustomed\r\n    vigilance on such a valuable occasion as will render you dear to all\r\n    honest men, as well as particularly giving me an opportunity of\r\n    showing with what esteem I am, dear brother,\r\n\r\n                             Your most affectionate brother,\r\n                                       And most humble servant.\"\r\n                                                     [No Signature.]\r\n\r\n    \"Inverness, 30th of March, 1746.\"\r\n\r\nIn addition to the testimony of Lord Elcho, that of Maxwell of\r\nKirkconnel, has considerable weight in Lord George Murray's favour.\r\n\r\n\"He was censured,\" observes this excellent writer, \"by his enemies as\r\nbeing too tender of a family seat.[188] As I do not know the situation\r\nof this Castle, I cannot determine whether it was in his power to blow\r\nit up, or whether he had time to do it after he was informed of the\r\nmarch of the Hessians. But he has been so calumniated by the Secretary\r\nand his creatures, that nothing less than a direct proof ought to have\r\nany weight against him. In this case it is absurd to suspect him,\r\nbecause the family seat could never be in danger. If it was in his power\r\nto blow it up, he had only to acquaint the Governor when the mine was\r\nready, and let him send one of his officers to view it; the Governor\r\nwould certainly have prevented the effecting it and saved the Castle.\"\r\n\r\n\"About the same time that the siege of Blair was abandoned, that of Fort\r\nWilliam was also raised. It was found, indeed, difficult to make the\r\nHighlanders perform the regular duties of a siege; extremely brave in an\r\nattack, when allowed to fight in their own way, they were not possessed\r\nof that steady valour which is necessary to maintain a post; and it was\r\nnot easy to keep them long in their quarters, or even at their posts,\r\nwithout action.\"[189]\r\n\r\nThe loss of Blair, and the failure of the siege of Fort William, were\r\nfollowed by other misfortunes. Fatal mistakes in the vain endeavour to\r\nretrieve a sinking cause ensued. In the midst of his adversity, the\r\nyoung and gallant adventurer, for whom so much blood was shed, supported\r\nhis spirits in a wonderful manner, and acted, with a heavy heart, the\r\npart of the gay and prosperous. He gave balls at Inverness, and even\r\ndanced himself, which he had declined doing when in the midst of his\r\nprosperity at Edinburgh. Those who looked only on the surface of affairs\r\nwere deceived by his appearance of happiness; but the well informed knew\r\ntoo well that the crisis which was to end the struggle was rapidly\r\napproaching. To complete the sad summary of disappointments and\r\nmisfortunes, it was now ascertained that the expedition from Boulogne,\r\nand that from Dunkirk, with which the false-hearted French had so long\r\namused the unfortunate Jacobites, were entirely and perfidiously\r\nrelinquished.\r\n\r\nLord George Murray, meantime, was ordered to march to Inverness. He was\r\nnow worn with fatigues, and by the protracted anxieties of his\r\nsituation. Foreseeing, as he must have done, many of the dangers and\r\ndifficulties of the contest; observing, on the one hand, his eldest\r\nbrother, the Marquis of Tullibardine, the adherent of the Stuarts,\r\nproscribed, impoverished, a nominal proprietor of his patrimonial\r\nestates; on the other, beholding his second brother, the actual Duke of\r\nAtholl, cherished by Government, prosperous, honours showered down upon\r\nhim; what impulses less strong than that of a generous, and fixed\r\nprinciple of fidelity could have maintained his exertions in a service\r\nso desperate as that in which he had engaged?\r\n\r\nThe great deficiency in Lord George Murray's character was the absence\r\nof hope; but, independent of that vital defect, his attributes as a\r\nsoldier and a general cannot fail to excite admiration. His exertions\r\nwere unparalleled; besides the marching and fatigue that others had to\r\nundergo, he had the vast responsibility of command. \"Though others were\r\nrelieved and took their turns,\" he remarks, \"I had none to relieve.\" On\r\nfirst assuming the command, he received and despatched every express\r\nhimself; and saw the guards and sentinels settled. In gaining\r\nintelligence he was indefatigable; and his discipline was such that the\r\ncountry suffered but little from the visitations of his well-governed\r\nforces. But the time was fast approaching when his great abilities,\r\nwhich never ceased to be acknowledged by the whole army, his fortitude,\r\nand personal valour were to be put to the severest test.\r\n\r\nOn the third of April, Lord George Murray joined Charles Edward at\r\nInverness. On the eleventh intelligence was received that the Duke of\r\nCumberland, who had been stationed for some time at Aberdeen, was\r\nmarching towards Inverness. At first the intelligence of the Duke's\r\napproach was received with acclamations of joy; but the circumstances\r\nunder which the battle of Culloden was eventually fought, and the\r\nfatigues and impediments by which it was prefaced, changed that\r\nsentiment into one of distrust and despondency.[190]\r\n\r\nUpon receiving intelligence of the Duke's approach, expresses were sent\r\nin all directions in order to re-assemble the Jacobite forces. Those\r\ntroops which had been at the siege of Fort William were on their march\r\nto Inverness; but Lord Cromartie and his detachment were still at a\r\ngreat distance; the Duke of Perth and Lord John Drummond were at\r\nSpey-side, with a considerable body of men and all the horse. These were\r\nordered to retire as Cumberland's army approached. Unhappily, many of\r\nthe Highlanders, it being now seed time, had slipped away to their\r\nhomes, and it was, indeed, no easy task to allure them back. The\r\ninfluence of Lord George Murray over the forces continued, nevertheless,\r\nunabated. His mode of managing this fine, but rude people, was well\r\nadapted to his purpose, and proceeded from an intimate knowledge of\r\ntheir character. \"Fear\" he considered as necessary as \"love.\" \"I was\r\ntold,\" he remarks, \"that all the Highlanders were gentlemen, and never\r\nto be beaten, but I was well acquainted with their tempers.\" Their\r\nchiefs even inflicted personal chastisement upon them, which they\r\nreceived without murmurs when conscious of an offence. But they would\r\nonly receive correction from their own officers, and never would the\r\nchief of one Clan correct even the lowest soldier of another. \"But I,\"\r\nobserves Lord George, \"had as much authority over them all as each had\r\namongst his own men; and I will venture to say that never an officer\r\nwas more beloved of the whole, without exception, than I was.\" At any\r\ntime when there was a post of more danger than another, Lord George,\r\npossessing as he did this unbounded influence over the minds of his\r\ncountrymen, found it more difficult to restrain those who were too\r\nforward, than in finding those who were willing to rush into peril.\r\n\r\nOn Sunday morning, the thirteenth of April, it became a matter of\r\ncertainty among the Jacobite forces that the enemy had passed the Spey.\r\nOn the following day, Lochiel joined the army; the Duke of Perth also\r\nreturned, and the Prince and his forces assembled on an open moor, near\r\nCulloden. Many of the officers suggested that it would be desirable to\r\nretire to a stronger position than this exposed plain, until the army\r\nwere all collected, but the baggage being at Inverness, this scheme was\r\nrejected. The experienced eye of Lord George Murray soon perceived that\r\nthe ground which had been chosen was ill-adapted for the Highland mode\r\nof warfare, and he proposed that the other side of the water of Nairn\r\nshould be reconnoitred. But objections were made to any change of\r\nposition; and, situated as Lord George now was, distrusted by the\r\nPrince, and, perhaps, in some measure by others, since the failure at\r\nBlair, he was in no condition to contest so important a point. It was\r\nafterwards attempted to venture an attack by night. To this proposition\r\nnot only the Prince, but Lord George and most of the other officers were\r\nat first favourable: but, in the evening, it being generally understood\r\nthat there was no provision for the subsistence of the men the next day,\r\na circumstance attributable to the negligence of the persons employed\r\nfor the purpose at Inverness, a number of men dispersed in search of\r\nfood. The forces being thus reduced, Lord George objected, in concert\r\nwith others, to the projected night march; but Charles Edward, trusting\r\nto the bravery of his army, and being for fighting on all occasions, was\r\ndetermined on the attempt. \"What he had seen them do, and the justice of\r\nhis cause, made him too venturous.\"[191] The attack was, therefore,\r\nagreed upon, and Lord George commanding the rear, after marching nearly\r\nsix miles, found that it would be impossible to attack the enemy before\r\nday-break, and, therefore, gave it up, and returned to Culloden about\r\nfive in the morning.\r\n\r\nFatigued and hungry, the army awaited the approach of the English\r\nforces. It was between ten and eleven in the morning when they drew up\r\non the moor, and were placed in order of battle by O'Sullivan. Again\r\nLord George observed to that officer, that the ground was unfavourable:\r\nthe reply was, that the moor was so interspersed with moss and deep\r\nearth, that the enemy's horse and cannon could be of little service to\r\nthem; and that it was therefore well selected. By this time the young\r\nand unfortunate Master of Lovat had joined the forces, but Lord\r\nCromartie was still, by a fatal mistake, absent; and Macpherson, of\r\nClunie, was at three or four miles distance, marching with all possible\r\nexpedition towards Culloden. The stragglers and others were also\r\ncollecting, so that, as Lord George conjectured, the army would have\r\nbeen increased by two or three thousand more men that night, or the\r\nnext day. Stimulated by this reflection, he again looked wistfully to\r\nthe position beyond the water, and considered that if they passed there,\r\nthey would probably leave the moors to the enemy, and occupy a better\r\npost. But he was overruled.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\"I shall say little,\" writes Lord George Murray, in his journal, \"of\r\nthis battle, which was so fatal.\" In a memoir, written by Colonel Ker,\r\nof Gradyne, an officer of distinguished military reputation, a minute\r\nand animated account is, however, given of all the incidents of the\r\neventful fifteenth of April.\r\n\r\nCharles Edward having with some difficulty procured some bread and\r\nwhiskey at Culloden, reposed for a short time after marching all night.\r\nIn the morning intelligence was brought him that the enemy were in\r\nsight. Whilst the army was forming, Colonel Ker was sent to reconnoitre\r\nthe enemy. On returning, he informed the Prince and Lord George Murray,\r\nwho was then with him, that the enemy were marching in three columns,\r\nwith their cavalry on the left, so that they would form their line of\r\nbattle in an instant. The Prince then ordered his men to draw up in two\r\nlines, and the few horse which he had were disposed in the rear towards\r\nthe wings; the cannon was to be dispersed in the front; this was brought\r\nup with difficulty from the want of horses. The ground which had been\r\noccupied the day before was too distant for the army to reach; so that\r\nthey were drawn up a mile to the westward with a stone enclosure which\r\nran down to the water of Nairn, on the right of the first line.\r\n\r\nThe Highland soldiers, many of whom had been summoned from their sleep\r\namong the woods of Culloden, were aroused from among the bushes, and\r\ncame drowsy, and half-exhausted to the field; yet they formed themselves\r\ninto order of battle with wonderful dispatch. Unhappily no council of\r\nwar was held upon the plain of Culloden in the hurry of that day. In\r\naddition to the confusion, and want of concert which this omission\r\nproduced, was a still more injurious circumstance. The army, as has been\r\nrelated, was drawn up in two lines; Lord George commanded the first,\r\nwhich was composed of the Atholl brigade. This regiment was placed by\r\nLord George on the right of the line: unfortunately, the Clan Macdonald,\r\nproud and fiery, claimed the precedence. They grounded their assertion\r\nof right to the usage of time immemorial; and to their having had it\r\nduring the two previous battles. Lord George, on the other hand,\r\nuncompromising as usual, insisted that in those actions even, his Atholl\r\nmen had the pre-eminence. The Prince, unable to decide, persuaded the\r\nchief of the Macdonalds to waive his claim; but the pride of the Scotch\r\nis never subdued; and whilst Macdonald yielded, their men were offended\r\nand disgusted with his compliance.\r\n\r\nThe Duke of Cumberland formed his line of battle at a great distance,\r\nand marched in battle order until he came within cannon shot, when he\r\nhalted, and placed his artillery in different parts in the front. His\r\narmy, to use a military phrase, outwinged that of Charles, both to the\r\nright and left, without his cavalry.[192]\r\n\r\nIt is not, as Lord George Murray observes, \"an easy task to describe a\r\nbattle.\" Most officers are necessarily taken up with what is near them,\r\nand the confusion, noise, and agitation effectually impede observation.\r\nThe commencement of the battle of Culloden was obscured by a thick fall\r\nof hail and snow, and on this occasion the tempestuous climate of\r\nScotland favoured her enemies, for the Prince's army faced the wind, and\r\nencountered the snow-storm in their faces. It was expected that the Duke\r\nwould begin the attack; and a party of his horse were sent during the\r\ninterval to reconnoitre the Jacobite army. When they came within cannon\r\nshot, loud hurras were heard on both sides; and voices (soon for ever to\r\nbe silenced) sent up to Heaven expressions of exultation and defiance.\r\nThe young Chevalier, whilst awaiting that event, rode along the lines to\r\nencourage his men, placing himself in a post of danger, in which one of\r\nhis servants was killed by his side. After some few minutes of solemn\r\nexpectation, Lord George Murray, who commanded the right of the army,\r\nsent Colonel Ker to the Prince to know if he should begin the attack? an\r\nanswer in the affirmative was returned. As the right was farther distant\r\nthan the left, Colonel Ker went first to the Duke of Perth who commanded\r\nthe left, and ordered him to begin; he then rode along the field until\r\nhe came to the right line, where Lord George Murray received from him a\r\nsimilar command. The Prince then placed himself behind the centre of the\r\narmy, having the whole of his forces under his eye, and thus being able\r\nto send orders on all exigencies.\r\n\r\nThe cannon of Prince Charles was first heard. It was returned with a\r\nfiring from the enemy of grape shot, which did great execution.\r\n\r\nThe Highlanders, who were forbidden to move until the word of command\r\nwas given, suffered that fire very impatiently. Some of them threw\r\nthemselves flat on the ground, and a few gave way and ran off.[193] The\r\nartillery of the enemy was very well served; that of the Jacobites was\r\nmanaged by common soldiers, the cannoniers belonging to one battery\r\nbeing absent. The contest was in every way unequal; yet the brave\r\ninsurgents, although ready to drop with fatigue, seemed to forget all\r\ntheir weariness and hunger when the enemy advanced.\r\n\r\nAt length, after some preliminary manoeuvres, the Prince sent orders\r\nto Lord George Murray to march up to the enemy. It seemed, indeed, high\r\ntime to come to a close engagement; for the cannonading of the enemy,\r\nwhich was directed chiefly towards the place which the Prince occupied\r\namong the cavalry, was very destructive; yet still Lord George delayed\r\nthe attack, judging, as it is supposed, that the adversaries were still\r\nat too great a distance, and that the strength of his men would be\r\nexhausted before they could reach them. There appears also to have been\r\nanother reason for the delay; Lord George had, on his right, a\r\nfarm-house, and some old enclosure walls, which the enemy now occupied;\r\nand he is conjectured to have been waiting until the Duke of\r\nCumberland's army came up to these walls, which would prevent him being\r\nflanked by the dragoons, who were, he observed, mostly on the left. But\r\nthe Duke did not advance. The Highlanders, who were impatient at the\r\ndelay, called out loudly to be led on; and at last he gave the command\r\nto attack.\r\n\r\nHis orders were obeyed. As his line began to move, the enemy began a\r\nsmart fire, which played chiefly upon the Atholl men, and was kept up by\r\na detachment of Campbells, who were stationed behind the enclosure\r\nwalls. It was the custom of the Highlanders to give a general discharge\r\nof their fire-arms, and then to rush, sword in hand, upon their foes:\r\nand the only chance of a victory for their party that day, was a general\r\nshock of their whole line at once; for the fury and valour of these\r\nnorthern warriors produced results almost incredible. Unhappily, several\r\ncircumstances destroyed this advantage. The two armies were not exactly\r\nparallel to each other, the right of Prince Charles's being nearer to\r\nthe foe than the left. The impetuosity of the Highlanders was such, that\r\nthey broke their ranks before it was time to give their fire; their\r\neagerness to come up with an enemy that had so greatly the advantage of\r\nthem at such a distance, made them rush on with such violence, and in\r\nsuch a confusion, that their fire-arms were of little service.[194]\r\nThis, it appears, was the disadvantage which Lord George had\r\napprehended. But there was still another inconvenience: the wind, which\r\nhad favoured the Jacobites at Falkirk, was now against them. They were\r\nburied in a cloud of smoke, and felt their enemies without seeing them.\r\nIn spite of all these obstacles they went, sword in hand, and broke the\r\nfirst line of the enemy; but the second advancing, and firing on them,\r\nthey gave way, leaving, says one who beheld the terrific scene, \"many\r\nbrave fellows on the spot.\" The rout, which began on the right of the\r\narmy, soon became general. The right line was, in fact, beaten before\r\nthe centre could advance to support it: and the centre of the army gave\r\nway, whilst the Macdonalds, who were advancing on the left, seeing\r\nthemselves abandoned on the right, and exposed to be flanked by enemies\r\nwho had nothing to oppose them in front, retired also.[195]\r\n\r\nLord George Murray behaved with incomparable valour, as indeed did the\r\nwhole of the line which he commanded, which was received by the enemy\r\nwith bayonets. These were the more destructive, as the Highlanders would\r\nnever be at the trouble, on a march, to carry targets. Yet the Duke's\r\nline of battle was broken in several places, and two pieces of cannon\r\nwere taken.[196] The brave troops whom Lord George commanded marched up\r\nto the very point of the bayonets, which they could not see until they\r\nwere upon them, on account of the smoke which was driven in their faces.\r\nAs the first line of the English army was broken, and as others were\r\nbrought up to their relief, some cannon, charged with cartouch shot from\r\ntheir second line, caused Lord George Murray's horse to start and plunge\r\nso much, that he thought the animal was wounded: he quitted his\r\nstirrups, and was thrown. \"After thus being dismounted, I brought up,\"\r\nwrites Lord George, \"two regiments of our second line, who gave them\r\nfire, but nothing could be done; all was lost.\"[197] The only good\r\neffect of the reinforcement was to arrest for a while the pursuit of the\r\ncavalry, and thus to save many lives. The field of battle was soon\r\nabandoned to the fury of an enemy, whose brutal thirst for vengeance\r\nincreased as the danger and opposition diminished. Some may consider\r\nthat the day of Culloden was a day of disgrace to the Highlanders; but\r\nto them it was an event of honour, compared with the discredit which it\r\nbrought upon their foes. To England was the disgrace. It was, at all\r\nevents, even if we measure the standard of honour by the degree of\r\nmilitary success, an inglorious victory. Independent of the inequality\r\nof numbers, was the inequality of circumstances; but greater, in many\r\nsenses, on this occasion, were the conquered, than their conquerors.\r\n\r\nThe Prince, seeing his army entirely routed, was at length prevailed\r\nupon to retire. Most of his horse soldiers assembled round his person;\r\nand he rode leisurely, and in good order, for the enemy advanced very\r\nleisurely over the ground. \"They made,\" observes Maxwell, \"no attack\r\nwhere there was any body of the Prince's men together, but contented\r\nthemselves with sabering such unfortunate people as fell in their way,\r\nsingle and disarmed.\" \"As the Duke's corps,\" Lord Elcho relates,\r\n\"continued to pursue in order of battle, always firing their cannon and\r\nplatoons in advancing, there were not so many people taken or killed as\r\nthere would have been had they detached corps to pursue; but every body\r\nthat fell into their hands got no quarter, except a few whom they\r\nreserved for public punishment.\"\r\n\r\nIn the flight of the Prince's army, most of the left wing took the road\r\nto Inverness; the right wing crossed the water of Nairn, and went to\r\nRuthven of Badenoch; the rest, to the number of five hundred, mostly\r\nofficers, followed the Prince into Stratherick, where he had stopped\r\nabout four miles from the field of Culloden. Of the Prince's conduct\r\nafter the battle, a very painful impression is given by Lord Elcho. \"As\r\nhe had taken it into his head he had been betrayed, and particularly by\r\nLord George Murray, he seemed very diffident of everybody except the\r\nIrish officers; and he appeared very anxious to know whether he had\r\ngiven them all higher commissions than they had at their arrival, on\r\npurpose that they might get them confirmed to them upon their return to\r\nFrance. He neither spoke to any of the Scots' officers present, nor\r\ninquired after any of the absent. Nor, indeed, at any of the preceding\r\nbattles did he ever inquire after any of the wounded officers. He\r\nappeared very uneasy as long as the Scots were about him; and in a short\r\ntime ordered them all to go to Ruthven of Badenoch, where he would send\r\nthem orders; but before they had rode a mile, he sent Mr. Sheridan after\r\nthem, to tell them that they might disperse, and everybody shift for\r\nhimself the best way he could. Lord George Murray and Lord John Drummond\r\nrepeated the same orders to all the body of the army that had assembled\r\nat Ruthven. The Prince kept with him some of Fitzjames's Horse, and went\r\nthat night to a house in the head of Stratherick, where he met Lord\r\nLovat and a great many other Scots' gentlemen, who advised him not to\r\nquit the country, but to stay and gather together his scattered forces.\r\nBut he was so prejudiced against the Scots, that he was afraid they\r\nwould give him up to make their peace with the Government; for some of\r\nthe Irish were at pains to relate to him, in very strong terms, how the\r\nScots had already sold his great-grandfather to the English: and, as he\r\nwas naturally of a suspicious temper, it was not a difficult matter to\r\npersuade him of it. And he always believed it until the fidelity of the\r\nHighlanders shown to him during the long time he was hid in their\r\ncountry, convinced him and everybody else of the contrary.\"[198]\r\n\r\nThis history of distrust and ingratitude is, however, to be contrasted\r\nwith very different statements. When the Prince heard from Colonel Ker,\r\nafter the battle, that Lord George Murray had been thrown from his\r\nhorse, but was not wounded, Charles, in the presence of all the officers\r\nwho were assembled around his person, desired Colonel Ker to find out\r\nLord George, and to \"take particular care of him.\" Nor was there, among\r\nthe whole number of those writers who witnessed the battle of Culloden,\r\na dissentient voice with regard to the bravery of their\r\nLieutenant-General and to the admirable disposition of his troops. Had\r\nhe, like Lord Strathallan, sought and found his fate upon the field of\r\nbattle, his memory would have been exalted into that of a hero.\r\n\r\nTwo days after the defeat, the Duke of Perth, the Marquis of\r\nTullibardine, Lord George Murray, Lord Ogilvie, Lord Nairn, and several\r\nother chieftains and officers met at Ruthven in Badenoch, and discussed\r\nthe events which had ended in the ruin of their cause. They were\r\nunanimous in concluding that the night attack, upon which many persons\r\ninsisted as practicable, could not have been attempted.[199]\r\n\r\nFor some time after the battle, hopes were entertained of an effectual\r\nrallying of the forces. By a letter from one of the Prince's\r\naides-de-camp, Alexander Macleod, to Clunie Macpherson, on the very day\r\nof the battle, it appears that his party soon hoped, or pretended to\r\nhope, \"to pay Cumberland back in his own coin.\" A review of the fragment\r\nof the army was projected at Fort-Augustus, on the seventeenth of April;\r\nand amends were promised to be made for the \"ruffle at Culloden.\"[200]\r\n\"For God's sake,\" wrote Mr. Macleod, \"make haste to join us; and bring\r\nwith you all the people that can possibly be got together. Take care in\r\nparticular of Lumisden and Sheridan, as they carry with them the sinews\r\nof war.\"\r\n\r\nTo this letter Lord George Murray added some lines, which prove how\r\nhopeless, at that moment, he considered any project of rallying; and,\r\nindeed, even before the epistle was dispatched to Clunie, the Prince had\r\nleft Gorteleg, and taken refuge in \"Clanranald's country.\"\r\n\r\nNotwithstanding the Prince's flight, Lord George Murray, presuming that\r\nhe could still make a stand, remained at Ruthven, where a force of\r\nbetween two and three thousand men was assembled. It was found, however,\r\nimpossible, from the want of provisions, to keep such an army together;\r\nand, in a few days, a message from Charles, ordering his ill-fated\r\nadherents to disperse, decided their fate. At this epoch Lord George\r\nMurray addressed a letter to Charles, certainly not calculated to soothe\r\nthe feelings of the unfortunate young man, nor to conciliate the bitter\r\nspirit which afterwards, during the lapse of years, never abated towards\r\nhis former General. The letter began thus.[201]\r\n\r\n    \"May it please your Royal Highness,\r\n\r\n    As no person in these Kingdoms ventured more frankly in the cause\r\n    than myself, and as I had more at stake than almost all the others\r\n    put together, I cannot but be very deeply affected with our late\r\n    loss, and present situation; and I declare, that were your Royal\r\n    Highness's person in safety, the loss of the cause, and the\r\n    unfortunate and unhappy state of my countrymen is the only thing\r\n    that grieves me; for I thank God I have resolution to bear my own\r\n    family's ruin without a grudge.\"\r\n\r\nAfter this preface Lord George, in no softened terms, pointed out what\r\nhe conceived to be the causes of the failure of the enterprise;--the\r\nimprudence of having set up the standard without aid from France; the\r\ndeficiencies and blunders of Mr. O'Sullivan, whose business it was to\r\nreconnoitre the field of battle, but who had not so much as viewed it\r\nbefore the affair of Culloden. He next pointed out the negligence, if\r\nnot treachery, of Mr. Hay, who had the charge of the provisions. To the\r\ndisgraceful mismanagement of this important department might, indeed,\r\nthe ruin of the army be traced. \"For my own part,\" added Lord George,\r\n\"I never had any particular discussion with either of them; but I ever\r\nthought them incapable and unfit to serve in the stations they were\r\nplaced in.\"\r\n\r\nAfter these too just remarks, Lord George formally resigned his\r\ncommission into the Prince's hands. It had, it appears, been his\r\nintention to have done so after the failure at Blair; but he was\r\ndissuaded by his friends. \"I hope your Royal Highness will now accept of\r\nmy demission. What commands you may have for me in any other situation,\r\nplease honour me with them.\"\r\n\r\nThis letter was dated from Ruthven, two days after the battle of\r\nCulloden. The inference which has been drawn from it was, that Lord\r\nGeorge did not contemplate the abandonment of the campaign. It appears\r\nto have been his opinion that the Highlanders could have made a summer\r\ncampaign without any risk, marching, as they could, through places in\r\nwhich no regular troops could follow them. They could never starve as\r\nlong as there were sheep and cattle in the country; and they might\r\nprobably have carried on an offensive, instead of a defensive war. But\r\nCharles, disheartened, as men of over sanguine tempers usually are, in\r\nmisfortune, to the last degree, resolved on escaping to France. He\r\naddressed a farewell letter to the Chiefs, and then commenced that long\r\nand perilous course of wanderings in which his character rose to\r\nheroism, and which presents one of the most interesting episodes in\r\nhistory of which our annals can boast.\r\n\r\nLord George Murray was long a fugitive from place to place in his native\r\ncountry, before he could find means to escape to the continent. In\r\nDecember (1746) he visited, in private, his friends in Edinburgh, and\r\nthen embarking at Anstruther, in the Frith of Forth, he set sail for\r\nHolland. Whether he ever returned to his native country is doubtful,\r\nalthough it appears, from a letter among the Stuart papers, that he had\r\nit in contemplation, in order to bring over his wife and family.\r\n\r\nHis fate in a foreign land, however embittered by the ingratitude and\r\nhatred of Charles Edward, was cheered by the presence of his wife and\r\nchildren, with the exception of his eldest son, who was retained in\r\nScotland, and educated under the auspices of James Duke of Atholl. His\r\nfirst movement after reaching Holland, was to repair to Rome, there to\r\npay his respects to the Chevalier St. George, and to unfold to him the\r\nmotives of his conduct in the foregoing campaign of 1745. The Chevalier,\r\naffectionately attached as he was to his eldest son, was aware of his\r\ndefects, and sensible of the pernicious influence which was exercised\r\nover his mind by the enemies of Lord George Murray; James, who never\r\nappears in a more amiable light than in his correspondence, endeavoured\r\nto conciliate both parties. His letters to Charles Edward, treasured\r\namong the Stuart papers, display kindness and great good sense. His\r\nmediation in this instance was, however, wholly ineffectual. After the\r\ntreacherous conduct of Murray of Broughton, the Prince began even to\r\nsuspect that Lord George was concerned in the baseness of that\r\nindividual. This notion was urgently combated by James; at the same time\r\nhe recommended the Prince, not only as a matter of right, but of\r\npolicy, to conciliate Lord George, who \"owned that he had been wrong\r\ntowards Charles, but insisted upon his zeal in the Prince's service.\"\r\n\"Persons,\" adds the politic Chevalier, \"like him may do both good and\r\nhurt; and it is prudent to manage them, and would manifestly be of\r\nprejudice could they be able to say their former services had been\r\ndisregarded.\" But James addressed himself to one who could never\r\ndissimulate. Whatever Charles's errors might be, they were not envenomed\r\nby any portion of cunning, and no motive of prudence could soften him\r\ntowards one whom he unjustly disliked.\r\n\r\nLord George, who expected no favour from the English Government, was,\r\nnevertheless, anxious to be \"near home.\" He left Rome in May 1747, and\r\nafter remaining some time at Bologna, proceeded to Paris.[202] Here\r\nCharles was playing that ill-judged and desperate game, which was better\r\nsuited to a rash impostor, than to the acknowledged descendant of a long\r\nline of monarchs. Here he was rapidly effacing the remembrance of the\r\nbrave and generous wanderer who trusted to the honesty of the\r\nHighlanders; who bore his misfortunes as if he had been born in that\r\nland of heroes.\r\n\r\nThe first idea of Charles, upon hearing of Lord George Murray's arrival\r\nin Paris, was to imprison him as a traitor. \"I hope in God,\" writes his\r\nfather to the young Prince, \"you will not think of getting Lord George\r\nsecured after all I wrote to you about him, and will at least receive\r\nhim civilly.\" But no intercessions could nullify the indignation of\r\nCharles towards his former general.\r\n\r\nIt was far from Lord George Murray's intention, if we may believe the\r\nChevalier St. George, again to embroil himself in public affairs, or\r\neven to remain in Paris. His intention was to live privately in Germany\r\nor Flanders, in the hope of being rejoined by his wife. Upon reaching\r\nParis, he informed the Prince of his arrival; and proposed paying his\r\nrespects to him at St. Omer, where Charles was then living. Late on the\r\nevening of the eleventh of July, 1747, a gentleman, who at first refused\r\nto give his name, but who afterwards announced himself as Mr. Stafford,\r\ncalled on Lord George to convey to him a message desiring him not to \"go\r\nnear\" the Prince, and ordering him to leave Paris immediately. An answer\r\nwas returned, signifying that the Prince's commands should be obeyed.\r\nLord George left Paris, and he and the unfortunate young man whom he had\r\nserved, met no more. It is possible that the irritation of Charles was\r\naggravated by the recent intelligence of his brother's having become a\r\ncardinal: upon receiving the news of that event he shut himself up for\r\nsome hours alone. The name of his brother was no longer to be uttered in\r\nhis presence nor his health drunk at table.[203] Charles was at this\r\ntime in the power of both the Kellys, who are described by one of his\r\nadherents as \"false, ambitious, and sordidly avaricious.\"\r\n\r\nAfter visiting Poland, where he was received by Marshall Belriski as a\r\nrelation, and where he endeavoured to negotiate the restitution of some\r\ncrown jewels to James, as in right of the Chevalier's wife, the Princess\r\nSobieski, Lord George settled at Cleves. He changed his name to that of\r\nDe Valignie, and here he remained in obscurity with his family. \"My\r\nwife,\" he writes to the Chevalier St. George, \"came here on the tenth of\r\nSeptember, 1748, but was soon after seized with an intermitting fever,\r\nwhich has not yet left her. She begs leave to throw herself at your\r\nMajesty's feet.\" In 1750, Lord George removed to Emmerick; here he wrote\r\nan account of his campaign, which he addressed to Mr. Hamilton of\r\nBangour; from this, repeated extracts have been given in this memoir of\r\nhis life. The kindness of James Stuart towards him continued unabated:\r\nhe recommended him to the notice of the court of France; and consulted\r\nhim as to the probable success of a future enterprise in Scotland. On\r\nsuch a project Lord George Murray expressed himself cautiously, yet\r\nsomewhat encouragingly; and declared himself ready to shed the last drop\r\nof his blood in the cause. Happily his zeal was not again put to the\r\ntest. Lord George appears, in his letters, to have cherished in his\r\nretirement at Emmerick, a lingering hope that at some future day the\r\nStuarts might make another attempt. He was now in the decline of life,\r\nand yearning to behold again the country which he was destined to see no\r\nmore. \"How happily,\" he writes to Mr. Edgar,[204] \"should you and I be\r\nto sit over a bottle in Angus, or Perthshire, after a restoration, and\r\ntalk over old services. May that soon happen!\"\r\n\r\nMeantime some members of Lord George's family suffered the severest\r\ndistress. His uncle, Lord Nairn, had, it is true, escaped to France; but\r\nLady Nairn and her daughter, Lady Clementina, were reduced to the\r\nutmost penury in Scotland. They remained in their native country,\r\nprobably with the hope of saving the wreck of their fortunes, until all\r\nthat the troops had spared was sold, and the money which accrued from\r\nthe sale was exhausted. Such was the rapacity of the plunderers, that\r\nthey took even Lady Nairn's watch and clothes. The Government, although\r\nin possession of her estate, never gave her one farthing for\r\nsubsistence, but even made her pay a rent for the garden of one of Lord\r\nNairn's own houses in which she lived. But this is only one instance of\r\nthat catalogue of cruelties towards the Jacobites, which it would take\r\nvolumes to detail.\r\n\r\nIn 1751, Lord George Murray visited Dresden, where, owing to the\r\nmediation of James Stuart, he was well received. His letters at this\r\nperiod refer frequently to the exertions which he made for Lord Macleod,\r\nthe son of Lord Cromartie: to this young man a company was given in\r\nFinland, in the Prussian service, and the Chevalier St. George furnished\r\nhim with his accoutrements and equipage.\r\n\r\nThe eldest son of Lord George Murray remained, as we have seen, in\r\nScotland; but the second was, through the favour of the Chevalier,\r\nrecommended to the especial notice of the court of Prussia. The visit of\r\nLord George to Dresden seems to have been chiefly designed to push the\r\ninterests of this young man, who was introduced to the Count and\r\nCountess De Bruhl. The youth was to study the military science and\r\nexercises at Dresden, and at the same time to enjoy, in the house of the\r\nPope's Nuncio, the advantage of seeing company, and of forming\r\nconnections.\r\n\r\nHaving arranged these affairs, Lord George returned to Emmerick. His\r\nwife had left him for Scotland, in order to be confined there; and this\r\nevent, attended by so much inconvenience, and prefaced by a voyage of\r\ntwelve days, \"put her,\" as Lord George observed, \"somewhat out of\r\ncountenance, after twenty-three years' marriage.\" Her return was delayed\r\nfor some time. \"I shall be pretty lonely this winter (1751),\" writes Lord\r\nGeorge to Mr. Edgar, \"for my wife, who was brought to bed of a daughter\r\nthe middle of September, recovered but very slowly, and now the season\r\nof the year is too far advanced for her to venture so long a voyage;\r\nbesides, she has some thoughts that Lady Sinclair (his daughter) may\r\ncome with her in the spring.\" In his solitude, anxieties about his\r\npatrimonial property added to the sorrows of the exile. \"I am\r\ntold,\"[205] he writes, \"that the Duke of Atholl is desirous of selling\r\nthe roialty of the Isle of Man to the London Government, for which, they\r\nsay, he is offered fifteen thousand pounds sterling. Had it not been for\r\nmy situation, I believe he could not have done it without my consent;\r\nbut, I'm sorry to say it, and it is a truth, that he is full as much my\r\nenemy as any of that Government. He has sent my eldest son abroad, but,\r\nas I understand, with positive orders not to see nor correspond with me.\r\nAll this is the more extraordinary that, thirty years ago, before he\r\nturned courtier, he seemed to have very different notions. Most people\r\nin Britain now regard neither probity nor any other virtue--all is\r\nselfish and vainal (venial). But how can I complean of such hard usage,\r\nwhen my royal master has met with what is a thousand times more cruel:\r\nhe bears it like a Christian hero, and it would ill suit me to repine. I\r\nthank the Almighty I never did, and I think it my greatest honour and\r\nglory to suffer in so just and upright a cause.\" Hope, however, of one\r\nday returning to Scotland, was not extinct. He thus continues: \"Upon\r\nreceipt of the note you sent me, I have gott the carabin, for which I\r\nreturn you many thanks. I expect to kill a wild bore with it; but I fain\r\nhope Providence may still order it that I may make use of it at home,\r\nand, if all succeeds to our wishes, how happy should I think myself to\r\nsend you, when you returned to Angus, a good fatt stagg, shott in the\r\nforest of Atholl with your own gun.\"\r\n\r\nUntil five years before his death, Lord George still cherished the hope\r\nthat France would again find it her interest to support the claims of\r\nthe Stuarts. He had always considered that the support of the French\r\nwould be decisive of the success of the cause. \"Had the ministers of the\r\ncourt of Versailles, ten years ago, been persuaded that the supporting\r\nof his Royal Highness the Prince, at the beginning of his attempt, in a\r\nproper manner with the best measures they could take for the interest of\r\ntheir master as well as that of the King, our gracious sovereign, I\r\nthink I do not say too much if I affirm that his Royal Highness would\r\nnot have failed of success. I had at that time opportunities of knowing\r\nthe sentiments and way of thinking of most people in Great Britain.\r\nMany, very many, wished well to the cause. Great numbers would have\r\nlooked on, and would have turned to the side that had success. But there\r\nis no recalling what is passed. I believe that in France they are\r\nconvinced now of the error they were in at the time. If ever they\r\nresolve to espouse the cause of the royal family it must be in earnest,\r\nand their main view must be that. Then there would be no difficulty in\r\nadjusting limits in America. I have been much longer upon the subject\r\nthan I intended. Perhaps zeal has led me too far.\"\r\n\r\nThe period was now approaching when Lord George Murray was to close a\r\nlife of vicissitude and turmoil. He died in 1760 at Medenblinck, in\r\nHolland, leaving three sons and two daughters. Upon the death of James\r\nDuke of Atholl in 1764, John, the eldest son of Lord George Murray,\r\nsucceeded to the dukedom, and to the great possessions of the family. He\r\nmarried his first cousin, Charlotte, only daughter and heiress of his\r\nuncle, the Duke of Atholl; and in 1765 their Graces sold the sovereignty\r\nof the Isle of Man, upon the disposal of which Lord George Murray had\r\nexpressed much solicitude, to the British Government. The present Duke\r\nof Atholl, who succeeded his father in 1830, is the grandson of John,\r\nthird Duke of Atholl, and the great-grandson of Lord George Murray. The\r\ndescendants of this justly celebrated man have, therefore, shared a\r\nhappier fortune than those of many of the other attainted noblemen of\r\nhis party.\r\n\r\nThe attainder was not, however, set aside in favour of the son of Lord\r\nGeorge Murray without a petition to the King, upon which the House of\r\nLords gave a favourable report, and the objection was overcome.[206]\r\nBesides his eldest son, Lord George left two others; James, of Strowan,\r\nin right of his mother; George, of Pitkeathly, who became Vice-Admiral\r\nof the White--and two daughters; Amelia, first married to Lord Sinclair,\r\nand afterwards to James Farquharson, of Inverness; and Charlotte, who\r\ndied unmarried.\r\n\r\nThe mind of Lord George Murray was one of great original power, and less\r\ndependent upon those circumstances which usually affect the formation of\r\ncharacter, than that of most men. He was determined and inflexible in\r\nopinions, yet cautious in action. That he was sincere and honourable\r\nthere can now be little doubt. It was his consciousness of upright\r\nintentions which inspired him with contempt for the littleness of\r\nothers; and with his love of superiority, his self-will and ambition,\r\nthere was wrought a strong conviction of his own worth, as opposed to\r\nthe hollowness of some of his party. Throughout all his letters, and in\r\nhis journal, there is a strong evidence of his confidence in his own\r\npowers; of a self-sufficiency too lofty to be called vanity, but which\r\nsometimes descends to egotism. To his courage, his energy and\r\nperseverance, his military contemporaries have borne unanimous\r\ntestimony. They seem entirely to have comprehended a character which the\r\nunfortunate Charles Edward could never appreciate. They felt the\r\njustness of his ascendancy, and discriminated between the bluntness of\r\nan ardent and honest mind, careless of ordinary forms, and the arrogance\r\nof an inferior capacity. As a soldier, indeed, the qualities of Lord\r\nGeorge Murray rose to greatness: so enduring, and so fearless, so\r\ncareless of danger to himself, yet so solicitous for others. As a\r\ngeneral, some great defects may be pointed out in his composition,\r\nwithout detracting from his merits as a private individual.\r\n\r\nLet us first turn to the bright side of the picture. In activity and\r\nexertion Lord George Murray has not been surpassed even by the more\r\nfortunate, although, perhaps, not greater commanders of modern times. He\r\nwas indefatigable in business, and any one who desired access to him\r\ncould see him at any hour, whether at meals or in bed. \"On some\r\noccasions,\" he remarks, \"I have been waked six times a night, and had\r\neither orders to write, or letters to answer every time; for as I mostly\r\ncommanded a separate body of the army, I had many details that, in a\r\nmore regular army, would belong to different people.\" Every order, even\r\nthat which sent an officer to an out-post, was written by his own hand,\r\nand explained by him; every contingency that might occur in the\r\nexecution was canvassed, and every objection that was suggested was\r\nanswered by himself. The officers, therefore, confiding in their\r\ngeneral, performed their duties with cheerfulness, and made their\r\nreports with exactness. There was no confusion, nor misapprehension,\r\nwherever Lord George presided. As a disciplinarian, he was pre-eminent;\r\nno army ever quitted a country with so little odium, nor left behind\r\nthem such slight memorials of their march, as that of Charles Edward\r\nwhen it returned from Derby. The greatest excess that the Highlanders\r\nwere known to commit was the seizing horses to carry their baggage, or\r\nto carry their sick;--and these it was Lord George's endeavour always\r\nto restore, even at a great inconvenience to the soldiers. Even with\r\nevery precaution it was impossible wholly to restrain plundering,\r\nalthough the General undertook in person to control that evil. \"How\r\noften,\" he writes, \"have I gone into houses on our marches to drive the\r\nmen out of them, and drubbed them heartily?\"\r\n\r\nThis able man possessed another great requisite as a commander. He\r\nthoroughly understood his materials, he was perfectly acquainted with\r\nthe temper and disposition of his soldiers. It was the attribute which\r\nmade Marlborough unconquerable; and, in an army chiefly of Highlanders,\r\nit was one of the greatest value. By this Lord George acquired over the\r\nmembers of every respective Clan as much influence as each Chief\r\nseparately had. His corrections were well applied, and never lessened\r\nthe confidence nor affections of the soldiery. From the highest to the\r\nlowest, the men and officers had a confidence in him, which induced them\r\nto apply to him for redress in grievances, and to consider him as an\r\numpire in disputes.\r\n\r\nBut Lord George was not only a disciplinarian; in his own person, he set\r\nthe example of a scrupulous honesty. \"I never,\" he writes in his\r\nexplanation of his conduct, \"took the least thing without paying the\r\nfull value. I thought that I could not reasonably find fault with others\r\nin that, if I did not show them a good example.\"\r\n\r\nTo the sick and wounded Lord George invariably paid the utmost\r\nattention; and, under his guidance, the Highlanders, heretofore so\r\nfierce towards each other in their contests, were remarkable for a\r\ndegree of humanity which was disgracefully contrasted with the barbarity\r\nof their conquerors. Such were his general attributes in his military\r\nstation. Whatever doubts may have existed in the mind of Charles Edward\r\nas to the fidelity of his General, are silenced by the long and hopeless\r\nexile of Lord George Murray, and by the continued friendship of the\r\nChevalier St. George. No overtures, as in the case of the Earl of Mar,\r\nto the British Government, nor efforts on the part of his prosperous and\r\nfavoured brother, the Duke of Atholl, have transpired to show that in\r\nsaving Blair, there was a secret understanding that there should be a\r\nfuture reward, nor that any surmise of treachery had opened a door to\r\nreconciliation. Charles, be it remembered, was under that daily, hourly\r\ninfluence, which weakens the judgment, and exasperates the passions. His\r\nopinion of Lord George Murray must not be accepted as any evidence\r\nagainst one who had redeemed the inconsistencies of his youth by the\r\ngreat exertions of his manhood.\r\n\r\nSome vital defects there were, nevertheless, in this General, of\r\npowerful intellect, and of earnest and honourable intentions. His\r\ncharacter partook too largely of that quality which has raised his\r\ncountry as a nation in all other countries, prudence. For his peculiar\r\nsituation he was far too cautious. Persevering and inflexible, he was\r\ndestitute of hope. If it be true, that he entered into the undertaking\r\nwith a conviction that the cause could never prosper, he was the last\r\nman that should have been the general of an army whose ardour, when not\r\nengaged in action, he invariably restrained. All contending opinions\r\nseem to hesitate and to falter when they relate to the retreat from\r\nDerby, the grand error of the enterprise; the fatal step, when the tide\r\nserved, and the wind was propitious, and an opportunity never to be\r\nregained, was for ever lost.\r\n\r\nIn private society, Lord George Murray is reported to have been\r\noverbearing and hasty; his fine person, and handsome countenance were\r\nlessened in their agreeableness by a haughty deportment. He was simple,\r\ntemperate, and self-denying in his habits. In his relations of life, he\r\nappears to have been respectable. His letters show him to have enjoyed,\r\nat least, the usual means of education offered to a soldier, who entered\r\nupon active service at sixteen, or to have improved his own\r\nacquirements. They are clear and explicit, and bear the impress of\r\nsincerity and good sense.\r\n\r\nDistrusted as he was by Charles Edward, and misrepresented by others, we\r\nmay accord to Lord George Murray the indulgence which he claims from\r\nposterity in these, the last words of his vindication:--\r\n\r\n\"Upon the whole, I shall conclude with saying, if I did not all the good\r\nI would, I am sure I did all I could.\"\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[1] Nisbet's Heraldry, part iii. p. 205.\r\n\r\n[2] In the Life of the Marquis of Tullibardine, vol. i.\r\n\r\n[3] See Nisbet's Heraldry.\r\n\r\n[4] Nisbet's Heraldry, part iii. p. 206.\r\n\r\n[5] See a MS.

Therefore I'll say the less; only this is generally\r\nknown for a truth, that justice, loyaltie, and prudence, which have been\r\nbut incident virtues and qualities in others, are all three as inherent\r\nornaments, and hereditary in yours.\"[207]\r\n\r\nSuch praise far exceeds in value the mere homage to ancient lineage.\r\nWith these noble qualities, the race of Drummond combined the courage to\r\ndefend their rights, and the magnanimity to protect the feeble. This\r\nlast characteristic is beautifully described in the following words:\r\n\r\n\"For justice, as a poor stranger, often thrust out of doors from great\r\nhouses, where grandeur and utility are commonly the idolls that's\r\nworshipped,--_quid non mortalia pectora cogis?_--has always found\r\nsanctuary in yours, which has ever been ane encouragement to the good, a\r\nterror to the bad, and free from the oppression of either.\"\r\n\r\nTo this magnanimous spirit were added loyalty to the sovereign, and\r\nprudence in the management of private affairs; a virtue of no small\r\nprice, for it rendered the House of Drummond independent of Court\r\nfavour, and gave to its prosperity a solid basis. \"The chiefs of this\r\nfamily lived,\" says their historian, \"handsomely, like themselves; and\r\nstill improved or preserved their fortunes since the first founder.\"\r\n\r\nThe origin of this race is, perhaps, as interesting as that of any of\r\nthe Scottish nobility, and has the additional merit of being well\r\nascertained.\r\n\r\nAfter the death of Edward the Confessor, the next claimant to the Crown,\r\nEdgar Atheling, alarmed for his safety after the Norman Conquest, took\r\nshipping with his mother Agatha, and with his two sisters, Margaret and\r\nChristiana, intended to escape to Hungary; but owing to a violent storm,\r\nor, as the noble historian of the Drummonds well expresses it, \"through\r\nDivine Providence,\" he was driven upon the Scottish coast, and forced to\r\nland upon the north side of the Firth of Forth. He took shelter in a\r\nlittle harbour west of the Queen's Ferry, ever since called St.\r\nMargaret's Hook, from Edgar's sister Margaret, who, for the \"rare\r\nperfectiones of her body and mind,\" was afterwards chosen by Malcolm\r\nCanmore, to the great satisfaction of the nation, for his Queen.\r\nMargaret was therefore married to the Scottish monarch at Dunfermline in\r\nthe year 1066.\r\n\r\nThis alliance was not the only advantage derived by the young and exiled\r\nEnglish King from his accidental landing in Scotland. Penetrated with\r\ngratitude for former services conferred upon himself by Edward the\r\nConfessor, Malcolm supported the cause of Edgar, and received and\r\nbestowed upon his adherents lands and offices, in token of kindness to\r\nhis royal guest. Hence some of the most potent families in the kingdom\r\nhad their origin.\r\n\r\nAmongst the train of Edgar Atheling at Dunfermline was an Hungarian,\r\neminent for his faithful services, but especially for his skilful and\r\nsuccessful conduct of the vessel in which the fugitives had sailed from\r\nEngland. He was highly esteemed by the grateful Queen Margaret, who\r\nrecommended him to the King; and, for his reward, lands, offices, and a\r\ncoat of arms suitable to his quality, were conferred on him, together\r\nwith the name of Drummond.\r\n\r\nIt was about this period that surnames were first introduced, and that\r\npatronymicks were found insufficient to designate heroes. Since the new\r\ndesignations were often derived from some office, as well as the\r\npossession of lands and peculiar attributes, the Hungarian obtained his\r\nname in consequence of his nautical skill; Dromont, or Dromond, being,\r\nin different nations, the name of a ship, whence the commander was\r\ncalled Dromount, or Dromoner.\r\n\r\nThe first lands bestowed upon the Hungarian were situated in\r\nDumbartonshire, and in the jurisdiction of the Lennox; a county full of\r\nrivers, lochs, and mountains, \"emblematically expressed,\" says Lord\r\nStrathallan, \"in the coats of arms then given to him, wherein hunting,\r\nwaters, hounds, inhabitants wild and naked, are represented.\" To these\r\ngifts was added the office of Thane, Seneschal, or Stuart Heritable of\r\nLennox,--names all meaning the same thing, but altering with the\r\ntimes.[208]\r\n\r\nThe Hungarian, whose Christian name is conjectured to have been Maurice,\r\nwas then naturalized a Scot; and all the parts of his coat-armour were\r\ncontrived to indicate his adventures, his name, office, and nation. He\r\ndied in an encounter near Alnwick Castle, fighting valiantly, in order\r\nto avenge the surprise of that place by William Rufus, in 1093.\r\n\r\nThe records of the family of Drummond were for several generations\r\ndefective after the death of Maurice; but there exists no doubt but that\r\nhe was the founder of a family once so prosperous, and afterwards so\r\nunfortunate. The name of Maurice was preserved, according to the\r\nScottish custom of naming the eldest son after his father, for many\r\nsucceeding generations.\r\n\r\nThe family continued to increase in importance, and to enjoy the favour\r\nof royalty; and the marriage of the beautiful Annabella Drummond to\r\nRobert the Third, King of Scotland, produced an alliance between the\r\nHouse of Drummond and the royal families of Austria and Burgundy. In\r\n1487 James the Third ennobled the race by making John Drummond, the\r\ntwelfth chief in succession, a Lord of Parliament. As the annals of the\r\nrace are reviewed, many instances of valour, wisdom, and unchangeable\r\nprobity arise; whilst some events, which have the features of romance,\r\ndiversify the chronicle. Among these is the story of the fair Margaret\r\nDrummond, who has been celebrated by several of our best historians.\r\n\r\nBetween Margaret and James the Fourth of Scotland an attachment existed.\r\nThey were cousins; and a pretext was made by the nobles and council, on\r\nthat account, to prevent a marriage which they alleged to be within the\r\ndegrees of consanguinity permitted by the Canon law: nevertheless, under\r\npromise of a marriage, Margaret consented to live with her royal lover,\r\nand the result of that connexion was a daughter. This happened when\r\nJames was only in his sixteenth year, and whilst he was Duke of Rothsay;\r\nyet the monarch was so much touched in conscience by the engagement, or\r\nbetrothal, between him and the young lady, that he remained unmarried\r\nuntil the age of thirty, about a year after the death of Margaret\r\nDrummond.\r\n\r\nThat event, it was surmised, was caused by poison; the common tradition\r\nbeing that a potion was provided for Margaret at breakfast, in order to\r\nfree the King from his bonds, that he might \"match with England.\" \"But\r\nit so happened,\" says the narrative,[209] \"that she called two of her\r\nsisters, then with her in Drummond, to accompany her that morning, to\r\nwit, Lilias, Lady Fleming, and a younger, Sybilla, a maid; whereby it\r\nfell out all the three were destroyed with the force of the poyson. They\r\nly burried in a curious vault covered with three faire blue marble\r\nstones, joyned closs together, about the middle of the queir of the\r\ncathedral church of Dumblane; for about this time the burial-place for\r\nthe familie of Drummond at Innerpeffrie was not yet built. The monument\r\nwhich containes the ashes of these three ladyes stands entire to this\r\nday, and confirms the credit of this sad storie.\"\r\n\r\nThe daughter of Margaret Drummond, Lady Margaret Stuart, was well\r\nprovided for by the King; and was married, in the year 1497, to Lord\r\nGordon, the eldest son of the Earl of Huntley, \"a gallant and handsome\r\nyouth.\" From this union four noble families are descended; the Gordons,\r\nEarls of Huntley; the Countess of Sutherland; the Countess of Atholl,\r\nwho was the mother of Lady Lovat; and Lady Saltoun. James the Fourth\r\ntestified his regret for the death of his beloved Margaret, and his\r\nsolicitude for her soul's benefit, in a manner characteristic of his age\r\nand character. In the Treasurer's accounts for February 1502-3, there\r\noccurs this entry, \"Item, to the priests that sing in Dumblane for\r\nMargaret Drummond, their quarter fee, five pounds:\" and this item,\r\noccurring regularly during the reign of James the Fourth, \"Paid to two\r\npriests who were appointed to sing masses for Margaret in the cathedral\r\nof Dumblane, where she was buried,\" marks his remembrance of his\r\nbetrothed wife.\r\n\r\nOne of the greatest ornaments of the ancient House of Drummond was\r\nWilliam Drummond, a descendant of the Drummonds of Carnock, son of Sir\r\nJohn Drummond of Hawthornden, and author of the \"History of the Five\r\nJames's,\" Kings of Scotland.[210] The friend of Drayton, and of Ben\r\nJonson, this man of rare virtues presents one of the brightest examples\r\nof that class to which he belonged, the Scottish country-gentleman.\r\nTrue-hearted, like the rest of his race, Drummond was never called forth\r\nfrom a retirement over which virtue and letters cast their charms,\r\nexcept by the commotions of his country. His grief at the death of\r\nCharles the First, whom he survived only one year, is said to have\r\nshortened his days.\r\n\r\nIn 1605, the title of Earl of Perth was added to the other honours of\r\nthe family of Drummond,[211] who derived a still further accession of\r\nhonour and repute by the probity and firmness of its members in the\r\ngreat Rebellion. Like most of the other Scottish families of rank, they\r\nsuffered great losses, and fell into embarrassed circumstances on\r\naccount of heavy fines exacted by Oliver Cromwell. The house, Castle\r\nDrummond, was garrisoned by the Protector's troops, and the estates were\r\nravaged and ruined. Yet the valiant and true-hearted descendants of\r\nthose who had been thus punished for their allegiance, were ready again\r\nto adopt the same cause, and to adhere to the same principles that had\r\nguided their forefathers.\r\n\r\nIn the person of James Drummond, fourth Earl of Perth, who succeeded his\r\nfather the third Earl, in 1675, several high honours were centred. He\r\nwas made, by Charles the Second, Justice-General, and afterwards Lord\r\nHigh Chancellor of Scotland. He continued to be a favourite with James\r\nthe Second; and in 1688, when James fled from England, the Earl of\r\nPerth, endeavouring to follow him, was thrown into prison, first at\r\nKirkaldy, and afterwards at Stirling, until the privy council, upon his\r\ngiving security for five thousand pounds, permitted him to follow his\r\nroyal master. From James, the Earl received the title of Duke, which his\r\nsuccessors adopted, and which was given to them by the Jacobite party,\r\nof which we find repeated instances in the letters of Lord Mar. His son,\r\nLord Drummond, succeeded to all the inconveniences which attend the\r\npartisans of the unfortunate. Returning from France, in 1695, he was\r\nobliged to give security for his good conduct, in a large sum. In\r\nconsequence of the assassination plot, the vigilance of Government was\r\nincreased, and, in 1696, he was committed to Edinburgh Castle. During\r\nthe reign of William, a system of exaction was carried on with respect\r\nto this family.\r\n\r\n\"In a word,\" says the author of Lochiell's Memoirs, himself a Drummond,\r\nspeaking of James Lord Drummond, \"that noble lord was miserably harassed\r\nall this reign. He represented a family which had always been a blessing\r\nto the country where it resided; and he himself was possessed of so many\r\namiable qualities, that he was too generally beloved not to be suspected\r\nby such zealous ministers. He was humble, magnificent, and generous; and\r\nhad a certain elevation and greatness of soul that gave an air of\r\ndignity and grandeur to all his words and actions. He had a person\r\nwell-turned, graceful and genteel, and was besides the most polite and\r\nbest bred lord of his age. His affability, humanity, and goodness gained\r\nupon all with whom he conversed; and as he had many friends, so it was\r\nnot known that he had any personal enemies. He had too much sincerity\r\nand honour for the times. The crafty and designing are always apt to\r\ncover their vices under the mask of the most noble and sublime virtues;\r\nand it is natural enough for great souls to believe that every person of\r\nfigure truly is what he ought to be, and that a person of true honour\r\nthinks it even criminal to suspect that any he is conversing with is\r\ncapable of debasing[212] the dignity of his nature so low as to be\r\nguilty of such vile and ignoble practices. None could be freer of these,\r\nor indeed of all other vices, than the noble person I speak of. The\r\nfixed and unalterable principles of justice and integrity, which always\r\nmade the rules of his conduct, were transmitted to him with his blood,\r\nand are virtues inherent and hereditary in the constitution of that\r\nnoble family.\"[213]\r\n\r\nLord Drummond was afterwards engaged in the insurrection of 1715: he\r\nwas attainted, but escaped to France, and, dying in 1730, left the\r\ninheritance of estates which he had saved by a timely precaution, and\r\nthe empty title of Duke of Perth,[214] to his son James Drummond, the\r\nunfortunate subject of this memoir.\r\n\r\nSuch was the character borne by the father of James, Duke of Perth. This\r\nill-fated adherent of the Stuarts was born on the eleventh of May 1713;\r\nand three months afterwards, on the twenty-eighth of August, his father\r\ndeemed it expedient to execute a deed conveying the family estates to\r\nhim, by which means the property, at that time, escaped forfeiture. Like\r\nmany other young men under similar circumstances, this young nobleman\r\nwas educated at the Scottish College of Douay, consistently with the\r\nprinciples of his family, who were at that time Roman Catholics.\r\n\r\nIn his twenty-first year, the young Duke of Perth came over to Scotland,\r\nand devoted himself, in the absence of his father, to the management of\r\nhis estate. It is probable that his own inclinations might have led him\r\nto prefer the occupations of an elegant leisure to the turmoils of\r\ncontention; but, be that as it may, it was not reserved for the head of\r\nthe House of Drummond to rest contentedly in his own halls.\r\n\r\nThe nearest kinsmen of the young nobleman were active partisans of the\r\nChevalier St. George. His brother, Lord John Drummond who had been\r\nconfirmed in all his devotion to the cause by his education at Douay,\r\nhad entered the service of the King of France, and had raised a regiment\r\ncalled the Royal Scots, of which he was the Colonel. He was destined to\r\ntake an active share in the events to which all were at this time\r\nlooking forward, some with dread, others with impatience. But his\r\ninfluence was less likely to be permanent over his brother, than that of\r\nthe Duke's mother, whose wishes were all deeply engaged in behalf of\r\nJames Stuart.\r\n\r\nThis lady, styled Duchess of Perth, was the daughter of George first\r\nDuke of Gordon, and of Lady Elizabeth Howard, Duchess of Gordon, who, in\r\n1711, had astonished the Faculty of Advocates at Edinburgh by sending\r\nthem a silver medal with the head of the Chevalier engraved upon it. The\r\nDuchess of Perth inherited her mother's determined character and\r\npolitical principles; for her adherence to which she eventually\r\nsuffered, together with other ladies of rank, by imprisonment.\r\n\r\nThese ties were strong inducements to the young Duke of Perth to take an\r\nactive part in the affair of 1745, and it is said to have been chiefly\r\non his mother's persuasions that he took his first step. But there was\r\nanother individual, whose good-faith to the cause had been proved by\r\nexertion and suffering; this was the brave William, Viscount\r\nStrathallan, who possessed higher qualities than those of personal\r\nvalour and loyalty. \"His character as a good Christian,\" writes Bishop\r\nForbes, \"setting aside his other personal qualities and rank in the\r\nworld, as it did endear him to all his acquaintances, so did it make his\r\ndeath universally regretted.\"[215]\r\n\r\nLord Strathallan was the eldest surviving son of Sir John Drummond of\r\nMacheany, whom he had succeeded in his estates; and, in 1711, became\r\nViscount Strathallan, Lord Madertie, and Lord Drummond of Cromlix, in\r\nconsequence of the death of his cousin.[216] He had engaged in the\r\nrebellion of 1715, and had been taken prisoner, as well as his brother,\r\nMr. Thomas Drummond, at the battle of Sheriff Muir; but no proceedings\r\nhad been instituted against him. His escape on that occasion, as well as\r\nthe part which his kinsman, the Earl of Perth, took on that eventful\r\nday, are thus alluded to in an old ballad entitled the Battle of the\r\nSheriff Muir.\r\n\r\n\r\n\"_To the tune of the 'Horseman's Sport.'_\r\n\r\n    \"Lord Perth stood the storm; Seaforth, and lukewarm\r\n    Kilsyth, and Strathallan, not sla', man,\r\n    And Hamilton fled--the man was not bred,\r\n    For he had no fancy to fa', man.\r\n    So we ran, and they ran; and they ran, and we ran;\r\n    And we ran, and they ran awa', man.\"[217]\r\n\r\nLord Strathallan joined the standard of Prince Charles in 1745, and\r\nafterwards acted an important part in the events of that period. He was\r\nnot only himself a zealous supporter of the Stuarts, but was aided in\r\nno common degree by his wife, the eldest daughter of the Baroness Nairn\r\nand of Lord William Murray,--in his schemes and exertions. Lady\r\nStrathallan inherited from her mother, a woman of undoubted spirit and\r\nenergy, the determination to act, and the fortitude to sustain the\r\nconsequences of her exertions. But there was still another individual,\r\nnot to specify various members of the same family, whose aid was most\r\nimportant to the cause of the Jacobites.\r\n\r\nThis was Andrew Drummond, one of the family of Macheany, and uncle of\r\nLord Strathallan. He was the founder of the banking-house of Drummond at\r\nCharing Cross, which was formed, as it has been surmised, for the\r\nexpress purpose of facilitating supplies to the partisans of the\r\nChevalier. This spirited member of the family remained unchanged in his\r\nprinciples during the course of a life protracted until the age of\r\neighty-one. His part in the great events of the day was well known, and\r\nmeanly avenged by Sir Robert Walpole, who, in the course of the\r\ninsurrection, caused a run upon the bank. The concern, backed by its\r\npowerful connections, stood its ground; but the banker forgave not the\r\nminister. When the tumults of 1745 were at an end, Mr. Drummond so far\r\nyielded to the dictates of prudence as to go to court: he was received\r\nby George the Second, to whom he paid his obeisance. But when the\r\nminister, anxious to conciliate his stern and formidable foe, advanced\r\nto offer him his hand, Mr. Drummond turned round, folded his hands\r\nbehind his back, and walked away. \"It was my duty,\" he said afterwards,\r\n\"to pay my respects to his Majesty, but I am not obliged to shake hands\r\nwith his minister!\"\r\n\r\nOn the young James Drummond Duke of Perth, as chief of the House of\r\nDrummond, the eyes of the Jacobites were turned, with expectations which\r\nwere, to the utmost of the young nobleman's power, fulfilled. It was by\r\nhis mother's desire that he had been educated in France, where he was\r\nconfirmed in the principles of the Romish faith. He possessed, indeed,\r\nsome acquirements, and displayed certain qualities calculated to inspire\r\nhope in those who depended upon his exertions that he would prove a\r\nvaluable adherent to the cause. Naturally courageous, his military turn\r\nhad been improved by a knowledge of the theory of war: his disposition\r\nunited great vivacity to the endearing qualities of benevolence and\r\nliberality; he had the every-day virtues of good-nature, mildness, and\r\ncourtesy. His pursuits were creditable to a nobleman. He was skilled in\r\nmathematics, an elegant draughtsman, a scholar in various languages, a\r\ngeneral lover of literature, and a patron of the liberal arts. Nor was a\r\nfondness for horse-racing, in which he indulged, and in which his horses\r\nfrequently bore away the prize, likely to render him unpopular in the\r\neyes of his countrymen. But there were some serious drawbacks to the\r\nutility of the young nobleman as a public man.\r\n\r\nHis health, in the first place, was precarious. When a child, a barrel\r\nhad been rolled over him, and a bruise was received in his lungs, to the\r\neffects of which his friends attributed a weakness and oppression from\r\nwhich he usually suffered at bed-time; when \"he usually,\" as a\r\ncontemporary relates, \"took a little boiled bread and milk, or some such\r\ngentle food.\"[218] This was an inauspicious commencement of an active\r\nand anxious career. It was afterwards discovered, that with all his\r\nacquirements and accomplishments, and with his natural gallantry, the\r\nDuke was no practical soldier.\r\n\r\nIn obtaining an influence over the minds of his countrymen, the young\r\nDuke possessed one great advantage. He was descended from a House noted\r\nfor the highest principles of honour.[219]\r\n\r\n\"To give the reader an undeniable proof of the generous maxims of that\r\nHouse,\" says the author of Lochiell's memoirs, \"it will be proper to\r\nnotice, that, by the laws of Scotland, no person succeeding to an estate\r\nis, in a legal sense, vested in the property until he serves himself\r\nheir to the person from whom he derives his title. The heir often took\r\nthe advantage of this when the creditors were negligent, and passing by\r\nhis father, and perhaps his grandfather, served heir to him who was last\r\ninfefted; for unless they were actually seised of the estate according\r\nto the forms of law, they were no more than simple possessors, and could\r\nnot encumber the land with any deed or debts; whereby the heir got clear\r\nof all that intervened betwixt himself and the person whom he\r\nrepresented by his service. This was an unjustifiable practice, which\r\nthe diligence of creditors might always have prevented; and which is now\r\nwholly prevented by an act of parliament obliging every one possessing\r\nan estate to pay the debts of his predecessors, as well as his own,\r\nwhether representing them by a service or not.\r\n\r\n\"But the House of Perth was always so firmly attached to honour and\r\njustice, that there are no less than fifteen retours, descending\r\nlineally from father to son, extant among their records.\r\n\r\n\"Now a retour is a writ returned from the Court of Attorney, testifying\r\nthe service of every succeeding heir; and is therefore an\r\nunexceptionable evidence of paying his predecessor's debts, and of\r\nperforming his obligations and deeds. Such has been, and still is, the\r\nuniform practice of the truly noble Lords of the House of Montrose and,\r\nperhaps, some others of the ancient nobility have followed the same\r\ncourse, which will not only entail a blessing upon their family and\r\nposterity, but will likewise be a perpetual memorial of their integrity,\r\nhonour, and antiquity.\"\r\n\r\nThe young Duke of Perth fully maintained this high character of honour\r\nand liberal dealings, and as a landholder and a chief, he would, had he\r\nbeen spared, have proved himself a valuable member of society. He was,\r\nrelates an historian, a father to the poor;--and the interval of ten\r\nyears between his return to Scotland and the Rebellion was engaged in\r\nestablishing manufactures for the employment of his tenantry, and in\r\nacts of beneficence. Unhappily, it was not long before political\r\ncombinations diverted the attention which was so well bestowed in the\r\nimprovement of his country.\r\n\r\nIn the beginning of the year 1740, seven persons of distinction signed\r\nthe association, engaging themselves to take arms, and to venture their\r\nlives and fortunes for the Stuarts. Among these was the Duke of Perth.\r\nThis association was committed to Drummond of Bochaldy, who, besides,\r\ncarried with him a list of those chiefs and chieftains who, the\r\nsubscribers thought, were willing to join them, should a body of troops\r\nland from France. This list contained so great a number of names, that\r\nMurray of Broughton, in his evidence at the trial of Lord Lovat, said he\r\nconsidered it to be \"a general list of the Highlands;\" a palpable\r\nrefutation of the reasoning of those who have represented the Jacobite\r\ninsurrection as a partial and factious movement.\r\n\r\nThe Duke of Perth had now irrevocably pledged himself to engage in the\r\ncause, which required a very different character of mind to that which\r\nhe seems to have possessed. Like the unfortunate Lord Derwentwater, he\r\nwas calculated to adorn a smooth and prosperous course; but not to\r\ncontend with fiery spirits, nor to act in concert with overbearing\r\ntempers. Averse to interference, and retiring in his disposition, the\r\nDuke was conceived, by those who mistook arrogance for talent, to have\r\nbeen possessed of only limited abilities. The friend or relative who\r\ncomposed the epitaph to his memory inscribed on the Duke's tomb at\r\nAntwerp, has borne testimony to the strength of his understanding. All\r\nhave coincided in commending the honour and faith which procured him the\r\nrespect of all parties, and the chivalric bravery which won him the\r\naffection of the soldiery.\r\n\r\nIt is a melancholy task to trace the career of one so high-minded, so\r\ngentle, and so formed to adorn the peaceful tenour of a country life,\r\nthrough scenes of turmoil, disaster, and dismay; and, during the\r\ncontinuance of arduous exertions, to recall the slow and certain\r\nprogress of a fatal disease, which progressed during hardships too\r\nsevere for the delicate frame of this amiable young man to sustain\r\nwithout danger.\r\n\r\nThe younger brother of the Duke, Lord John Drummond, was constituted of\r\ndifferent materials. Courteous, honourable, and high-minded, like his\r\nbrother, he added to those attributes of the gentleman a strong capacity\r\nfor military affairs, to which he had applied himself from his earliest\r\nyouth. Intrepid and resolute, the roughness of the soldier was softened\r\nin this fine martial character by an elegance and ease of manner which\r\nsprang from a kind and gentle temper. The energy of Lord John Drummond's\r\nmind was shown by the enlistment of the Scottish Legion, under the\r\nprotection of Louis the Fifteenth. In him the soldiers always knew that\r\nthey had a sure, and firm friend: like his brother, when on the\r\nconquering side, clemency and humanity were never, even in the heat of\r\nvictory, forgotten by the young general. Individuals like these lamented\r\nand unfortunate brothers give a mournful interest to the history of the\r\nJacobites.\r\n\r\nThe Duke of Perth was one of the most sanguine of those who desired to\r\nsee Charles Edward land on the coast of Scotland. Of the representations\r\nwhich induced the Prince to take that step, and especially of the part\r\ntaken in the affair by the well-known Murray of Broughton, various\r\naccounts have been given. From Mr. Home we learn, that Mr. Murray used\r\nevery argument in his power to deter the Prince from invading Scotland\r\nwithout a regular force to support him. This account was doubtless the\r\nversion which the Secretary himself gave of his part in the business.\r\nThe statement of Lord Elcho differs greatly from that of Mr. Home.[220]\r\n\r\n\"Mr. Murray,\" says Lord Elcho, \"in the beginning of the year 1745, sent\r\none young Glengarry to the Prince with a state of his affairs in\r\nScotland, in which it is believed he represented everybody that had ever\r\nspoke warmly of the Stuart family, as people that would join him if he\r\ncame.\"[221] After Mr. Murray's own visit to France, he had an interview\r\nwith all the members of the Association, and there detailed to them the\r\nconference he had had with the Prince. The Duke of Perth was the only\r\nperson who did not, in that council, expressly declare against the\r\nPrince's coming to Scotland without assistance from France.\r\n\r\nThe battle of Fontenoy, on the eleventh of May 1745, in which the\r\nBritish army was cut to pieces, encouraged, nevertheless, the ardent\r\nspirit of Charles to proceed in his enterprise. The number of regular\r\ntroops in Scotland he well knew, was at that time inconsiderable; and he\r\nhad, as he conceived, from the representations of Murray, no other\r\nopponents than the British army. He was, probably, wholly ignorant of\r\nthe powerful enemies who afterwards co-operated against him in the\r\nsouth-western parts of Scotland.[222]\r\n\r\nThe Duke of Perth had already, in the beginning of the year, received,\r\nas well as others, his commission. He was appointed General of the\r\nforces in the north of Scotland, and was therefore one of the most\r\nimportant personages for Government to seize. The Duke was at that time\r\nat Drummond Castle, a place only exceeded in beauty and splendour, in\r\nthe Highlands, by Dunkeld and Blair. The aspect of this commanding\r\nedifice is one which recalls the association of ancient power and\r\nprincely wealth. Beneath its walls is an expanse of a magnificent and\r\nvaried country, combining all those features which characterize lands\r\nlong held in peace by opulent and liberal possessors. \"Noble avenues,\r\nprofuse woods,\" thus speaks one of unerring accuracy, \"a waste of lawn\r\nand pasture, an unrestrained scope, everything bespeaks the carelessness\r\nof liberality and extensive possessions; while the ancient castle, its\r\nearliest part belonging to the year 1500, stamps on it that air of high\r\nand distant opulence which adds so deep a moral interest to the rural\r\nfeatures of baronial Britain.\"[223]\r\n\r\nFrom the castle it was now attempted to make the Duke of Perth a\r\nprisoner; but since it would have been impossible to detain a Chief,\r\nprisoner in his own halls, and among his own retainers, a stratagem,\r\npeculiarly revolting to the Highland code of honour, was adopted to\r\nensnare the young nobleman.\r\n\r\nTwo Highland officers, Sir Patrick Murray and Mr. Campbell of Inverary,\r\nwere employed in this transaction, and a warrant was given to them to\r\napprehend the Duke of Perth. This they knew to be impossible without a\r\nlarge force; they therefore condescended to lower the character of\r\nScotchmen, by violating the first principles which regulate the\r\nintercourse of gentlemen. They were base enough to abuse the\r\nhospitality of the kind and ready host who had often welcomed them to\r\nDrummond Castle.\r\n\r\nOne day, these gentlemen sent the Duke word that they should dine with\r\nhim; he returned, in answer, that he should be proud to see them. On the\r\ntwenty-sixth of July, 1745, they went, and were entertained at dinner\r\nwith the liberal courtesy which always shone forth under that roof. One\r\nof the Duke's footmen, meantime, having espied an armed force about the\r\nhouse, called his Grace to the door of the room, and begged him to take\r\ncare of himself. This caution was even repeated more than once; but the\r\nDuke, trusting that others were like himself, only smiled, and said he\r\ndid not think that any gentleman \"could be guilty of so dirty an\r\naction.\" But he found that he was mistaken. After dinner, when the\r\nofficers had drunk a little, they took courage to inform the Duke of\r\ntheir errand; and, to confirm their statement, one of them drew the\r\nwarrant out of his pocket. The Duke behaved with great presence of mind;\r\nhe received their summons calmly, but begged permission to retire to a\r\ncloset in the room where they were sitting, to get himself ready. This\r\nwas assented to: the Duke went into the closet, in which, however, there\r\nwas a door; he opened it and, slipping down a flight of stairs, escaped\r\nto a wood adjacent to his Castle. This wood was already surrounded by an\r\narmed force, and he was obliged to crawl on his hands and feet to avoid\r\nbeing observed by the sentinels. In such a situation he was hindered and\r\nwounded by briers and thorns, and at last was obliged to hide himself in\r\na dry ditch from his pursuers. They were, indeed, misled by the servants\r\nat the Castle, who, upon their inquiring for the fugitive, declared\r\nthat he had gone away on horseback. The officers however on their return\r\nto Crieff, where they were quartered, passed so near the place where he\r\nlay, that he heard what they were saying. When all the soldiers were out\r\nof sight, he sprang up; and seeing a countryman with a pony, having no\r\nbridle, but only a halter about its neck, he begged to have the use of\r\nit, and his request was granted. After this, he first rode to the house\r\nof Mr. Murray of Abercairney, and afterwards to that of Mr. Drummond of\r\nLogie. Here he was saved by one of those presentiments of evil which one\r\ncan neither explain nor deny. In the dead of night he was awakened by\r\nhis host, who begged the Duke to take refuge elsewhere; for fears, which\r\nhe could not account for, haunted his mind. The fugitive arose from his\r\nbed, and set off elsewhere. Shortly afterwards the house was invaded by\r\na party of armed men, who came to search for him, but retired\r\ndisappointed. His next meeting with his faithless guest, Sir Patrick\r\nMurray, was on the field of Gladsmuir, when the treacherous officer was\r\nmade prisoner. The Duke then took his revenge with characteristic\r\ngood-humour; for, after saluting the captured officer, he said\r\nsmilingly, \"Sir Patie, I am to dine with _you_ to-day.\"[224]\r\n\r\nAfter his escape from Logie, the Duke of Perth crossed over to Angus,\r\nincognito, and, attended only by one servant, rode through the north\r\ncountry without molestation, and arrived at the camp of Prince Charles.\r\nHere he met the afterwards celebrated Roy Stuart, then a captain of\r\nGrenadiers in Lord John Drummond's' regiment. That officer had embarked\r\nat Helvoetsluys for Harwich, where he had scarcely arrived before the\r\nship in which he had sailed was searched by authority of a Government\r\nwarrant.\r\n\r\nCharles Edward was at this time at Castle Mingry, whence accounts had\r\ntravelled to the capital of his arrival and projected hostilities. It\r\nwas long before his intentions were even believed; and, when believed,\r\nthey were treated at first with contempt. The Duke of Argyll, who was\r\nthen at Roseneath, had an intercepted letter of the Prince's put into\r\nhis hands, addressed to Sir Alexander Macdonald, together with a copy of\r\none to the Laird of Macleod. The Duke hastened to Edinburgh, and laid\r\nthese papers before Mr. Craigie the advocate. \"What a strange chimera,\"\r\nsaid Craigie, laughing, \"is it to suppose a young man with seven persons\r\ncapable of overturning a throne!\" \"His landing with seven persons only,\"\r\nreplied Argyll gravely, \"is a circumstance the more to be feared.\"[225]\r\n\r\nSir John Cope, nevertheless, long delayed obeying the orders of\r\nGovernment to march northwards, although great pains were taken by some\r\nof the Whig party to magnify the danger, and to add to the terrors of\r\nthe foe. Reports were even stated, in the presence of the magistrates,\r\nof a camp in Ardnamirchan, which was a large Scots mile in\r\ncircumference,--of several ships of war hovering near the coast,--of\r\ncannon of an enormous size; whilst the young Chevalier was described as\r\none of the strongest men in Christendom. All agreed that the invader had\r\nchosen the period of his enterprise judiciously. Scotland contained but\r\nfew forces, and those were newly levied men, sufficient in number\r\nmerely to garrison the forts and to overawe smugglers.\r\n\r\nNever was a country less prepared to receive an invasion,[226] and\r\nGeneral Cope's blunders soon encouraged the hopes of the Jacobites,\r\nuntil they were elated beyond measure. The sanguine Charles Edward\r\npledged the General's health in a glass of brandy: \"Here's a health to\r\nMr. Cope!\" he cried, in the presence of his forces; \"and, if all the\r\nUsurper's generals follow his example, I shall soon be at St. James's.\"\r\nThe toast was given by the private soldiers, to whom whiskey was\r\ndistributed to drink it. Well furnished with artillery, of which the\r\ninsurgents were destitute, General Cope might have obtained an easy\r\nvictory, or at any rate have dispersed the Jacobite army. Happy would it\r\nhave been for Scotland, had the rebellion thus been extinguished, before\r\nthe brave had sunk in civil strife, or loyal hearts been broken in the\r\nsilent agony of imprisonment! Many acts of heroism, numberless traits of\r\nfortitude, would indeed have been lost to the mournful admiration of\r\nposterity; but the vigorous hand, which crushes a hopeless struggle in\r\nits outset, is ever, in effect, the hand of mercy.\r\n\r\nFrom this time the Duke of Perth shared in the short-lived triumph of\r\nhis Prince. He marched with the army to Dunkeld, where, supping in the\r\nhouse of James, Duke of Atholl, who retired at their approach, the\r\nunfortunate Charles Edward forced a gaiety which he was said, at that\r\ntime, not to feel; asked for Scottish dishes; and, having picked up a\r\nfew words of Gaelic, pledged the Highland officers in that tongue. The\r\nDuke of Perth attended in the triumphant entrance into Perth on the\r\nfourth of September. This was the first town of consequence that Charles\r\nEdward had visited; and his appearance, mounted on a fine horse\r\npresented to him by Major Macdonell, and dressed in a superb suit of\r\ntartan trimmed with gold, produced a great impression upon the assembled\r\nmultitude, who greeted him with loud acclamations. He was conducted in\r\ntriumph to the house of Viscount Stormont, the eldest brother of the\r\ncelebrated Earl of Mansfield. Lord Stormont, though friendly to the\r\ncause, was not disposed to risk his life and property for the Stuarts.\r\nHe withdrew from the dangerous honour of entertaining the Prince, yet\r\nleft his family to receive him with all loyalty, and the Chevalier took\r\nup his abode at Lord Stormont's. It was an antique house with a wooden\r\nfront, which stood on the spot now occupied by the Perth Union Bank,\r\nnear the bottom of the High-street.[227] The evening was closed by a\r\nball given by the Prince to the ladies of the town. The Prince, probably\r\nwearied by the day's proceedings, danced only one dance, and then\r\nwithdrew. His bed, it is said, was prepared by the fair hands of Lord\r\nStormont's sister.\r\n\r\nOn the following day a different scene took place, for all was not\r\ncompliment that Charles encountered in the loyal town of Perth. Mass\r\nhaving been celebrated publicly, Charles was as publicly rebuked by a\r\nminister of the Kirk, who reminded him of his father's failure in the\r\nlast Rebellion, which he attributed to his adherence to Popery, to\r\n\"which he had sacrificed his crown.\" \"I prefer,\" replied the young\r\nChevalier boldly, \"a heavenly crown to an earthly one!\"[228]\r\n\r\nThe Duke of Perth had summoned many of his tenants to meet him at Blair,\r\nwhere he required them to bring all the rent due, under pain of\r\npunishment; and he now ordered them also to carry arms to the extent of\r\ntheir power. He is said to have insisted upon his privilege as Chief,\r\nwith a degree of rigour which, when his power was exerted to force his\r\ntenants into a course of certain peril, cannot be justified. Unhappily,\r\nthe practice was of too frequent occurrence among some of the chieftains\r\nto permit us entirely to dismiss it as a calumny. The amiable Lord\r\nDerwentwater, the brave Lord Southesk, as has been remarked elsewhere,\r\nand proved by letters and contemporary statements, were not free from a\r\nsimilar charge. The following anecdote is so little in accordance with\r\nthe forbearance assigned to the Duke of Perth both by enemies and\r\nfriends, that it must, however, be read with distrust. It is related by\r\nJames Macpherson:[229] speaking of the compulsory measures adopted, he\r\nsays, \"To this oppression of the Duke of Perth's likewise several\r\nsubmitted (such are the terrors of arbitrary power). Three however\r\nresisted, declaring that besides the inconvenience which the neglect of\r\ntheir affairs would subject them to, and the danger of the undertaking,\r\nit was against their conscience to assist the cause of Popery against\r\nthe true religion of their country; to which one of them had the\r\nboldness to add, he was sorry to see his Grace embarked in such a cause.\r\nUpon this, the Duke, flying into a rage, snatched up a pistol which lay\r\nin his tent, and immediately shot the poor man through the head. After\r\nwhich the other two made their escape from him, and one from the camp,\r\nthe other being pursued and killed by one of the rebels, who was witness\r\nto the whole transaction.\"\r\n\r\nWhilst the army remained at Perth, a singular incident occurred, which\r\nseems to prove that the subsequent surrender of Edinburgh was by no\r\nmeans unexpected by Prince Charles.[230]\r\n\r\nOne evening, when Macpherson was on duty as one of the Prince's guards,\r\na person came to the camp, and was by his desire conducted to the\r\npresence of the Chevalier. A long conference ensued, at which the Duke\r\nof Perth and the Marquis of Tullibardine were present. Soon after the\r\ndeparture of this stranger, it was rumoured that Edinburgh was to be\r\nbetrayed to the Jacobites, and that they were to take possession in a\r\nfew days. There must, therefore, have been some secret communication.\r\n\r\nIn the memorable events which followed this rumour, the Duke of Perth\r\ncontinually shared. He rode by the side of Charles Edward when the\r\ngallant adventurer, leaving Perth on the eleventh of September, crossed\r\nthe Firth at the Frew, and passed so near the walls of Stirling, that\r\nthe balls fired upon him and his forces from the castle fell within\r\ntwenty yards of the Prince. He proceeded on the march, commenced by the\r\nChevalier with the sum of only one guinea in his pocket, until they\r\narrived at Gray's Hill, a place two miles west of Edinburgh. Here\r\ndeputies from the town arrived to treat with Charles. \"I do not treat\r\nwith subjects,\" was the Chevalier's reply; whilst the Duke of Perth\r\nadded, \"The King's declaration, and the Prince's manifesto, are such as\r\nevery subject ought to accept with joy.\"\r\n\r\nMeantime, a company of volunteers under the command of Captain Drummond,\r\na gentleman of very different political sentiments to those of the\r\nmajority of this name, had assembled in the College yard, when, after\r\nbeing addressed by their gallant leader, they proffered their services\r\nto aid the dragoons stationed in the city, under the command of General\r\nGuest, in repelling the Jacobites. On Sunday, the fire-bell sounding in\r\nthe time of Divine service, emptied all the churches; and the people,\r\nrushing into the streets, beheld the volunteers drawn up in the Lawn\r\nMarket, awaiting the arrival of the dragoons, with whom they were\r\nprepared to march out of the town to repel the rebels. But this gallant\r\nresolution was not put into execution; and a force of two thousand\r\nstrong, not half of the soldiery having fire-locks, was suffered to\r\nforce their way into a town garrisoned by two thousand seven hundred\r\nsoldiers, all well supplied with arms and ammunition.\r\n\r\nThat Edinburgh was surrendered by the treachery of its Provost, seems\r\nbeyond all doubt. Archibald Stewart, who held that office at this\r\ncritical moment, gave many indications of perfidy or cowardice, which\r\nhave been duly related, although with little comment, by historians.\r\nNotwithstanding that the approach of the insurgents had been by measured\r\npaces, and that they had advanced so leisurely as to spend some hours\r\nlying on the bank of a rivulet near Linlithgow, no preparations for\r\ndefence had been made, although it was the wish of many of the\r\ninhabitants to resist the Jacobite army. It had been found that all the\r\ncalms, or moulds for bullets, had been bought up; ladies having gone to\r\nthe shops where they were made, to purchase them. When the danger became\r\nproximate, the Provost merely remarked, that, if the enemy wished to\r\nenter, he did not know how they could be prevented. He viewed the\r\nfortifications, it is true, and rummaged up some grenades that had lain\r\nin a chest since 1715. But the most suspicious incident occurred during\r\na meeting of the Town Council, when a Highland spy, having a letter in\r\nhis hand, was apprehended, and brought before the assembly. The letter\r\nwas given to the Provost, who hurried it into his pocket, and in great\r\nhaste broke up the assembly.[231] In all the deliberations for the\r\ndefence of the city, it was perceived that Mr. Provost Stewart was a\r\ndead-weight upon any measures of vigour; and nothing could have been\r\ndone to preserve Edinburgh from surrendering, unless he had been\r\nabsolutely bound in chains. Yet this unworthy magistrate, so faithless\r\nto his trust, so discreditable an instrument of the Jacobite cause, was\r\nafterwards acquitted, after a trial of four days, by the Lords\r\nJusticiary.\r\n\r\nThe progress of that cause now appeared such as to promise success to\r\nthe future exertions of its partisans. On the seventeenth of September,\r\nthe Prince received the news that Edinburgh was taken, and a stand of\r\none thousand arms seized; a circumstance which added greatly to the joy\r\nof the insurgents, who stood in need of arms. \"When the army came near\r\ntown,\" writes Lord Elcho, \"it was met by vast multitudes of people, who\r\nby their repeated shouts and huzzas expressed a great deal of joy to see\r\nthe Prince. When they came into the suburbs, the crowd was prodigious,\r\nand all wishing the Prince prosperity; in short, nobody doubted but that\r\nhe would be joined by ten thousand men at Edinburgh, if he could arm\r\nthem. The army took the road to Duddingston: Lord Strathallan marching\r\nfirst, at the head of the horse; the Prince next, on horseback, with the\r\nDuke of Perth on his right, and Lord Elcho on his left; then Lord George\r\nMurray, on foot, at the head of the column of infantry. From\r\nDuddingston, the army entered the King's Park, by a breach made in the\r\nwall. Lord George halted some time in the park, but afterwards marched\r\nthe foot to Duddingston; and the Prince continued on horseback, always\r\nfollowed by the crowd, who were happy if they could touch his boots, or\r\nhis horse furniture. In the steepest part of the road going down to the\r\nAbbey, he was obliged to alight and walk; but the mob, out of\r\ncuriosity, and some out of fondness, to touch him or kiss his hand, were\r\nlike to throw him down: so, as soon as he was down the hill, he mounted\r\nhis horse and rode through St. Anne's Yard into Holyrood House, amidst\r\nthe cries of six thousand people, who filled the air with their\r\nacclamations of joy. He dismounted in the inner court, and went up\r\nstairs into the gallery; and from thence into the Duke of Hamilton's\r\napartments, which he occupied all the time he was at Edinburgh. The\r\ncrowd continued all night in the outer court of the Abbey, and huzzaed\r\nevery time the Prince appeared at the window. He was joined, upon his\r\nentering the Abbey, by the Earl of Kelly, Lord Balmerino, Mr. Hepburn of\r\nKeith, Mr. Lockhart younger of Carnwath, Mr. Graham younger of Airth,\r\nMr. Rollo younger of Powhouse, Mr. Stirling of Craigbarnet, Mr. Hamilton\r\nof Bangor, Sir David Murray, and several other gentlemen of distinction:\r\nbut not one of the mob, who were so fond of seeing him, were asked to\r\nenlist in his service; and, when he marched to fight Cope, he had not\r\none of them in his army.\"[232]\r\n\r\nThe Prince, who was thus received with acclamations into the home of his\r\nforefathers, was at this time in the bloom of youth, being in the\r\ntwenty-fifth year of his age. Neither the agitation produced by the\r\nevents of that critical day on his sensitive temper, nor the fatigue of\r\nthe previous march to a young soldier, could diminish the grace of his\r\ndeportment, nor hide the natural majesty of his carriage. \"The figure\r\nand presence of Charles Stuart,\" even Home remarks, \"were not\r\nill-suited to his lofty pretensions.\" He was in height about five feet\r\nten inches, of a slender form; his features were aquiline; his\r\ncomplexion, though ruddy from the Highland air, was naturally fair. He\r\nhad the pointed chin, and small mouth in proportion to his other\r\nfeatures, of Charles the First. The colour of his eyes has been\r\nvariously described; being, according to some, \"large rolling brown\r\neyes,\" whilst in many of his portraits he is depicted as having full\r\nblue eyes.[233] The hair of Charles Stuart was concealed under a \"pale\r\nperuke;\" but, is said to have been red, or, according to most of his\r\nportraits, of a sandy hue. As he rode, with extreme grace, upon a fine\r\nbay gelding presented to him by the Duke of Perth, the bystanders\r\nremarked that an \"irregular smile,\" as one of them has expressed it,\r\nlighted up, by fits, a countenance which told but too plainly every\r\nemotion of the heart. An anxious, watchful look was, at times, directed\r\nto those around and near him; and, in particular, rested on the face of\r\nLord Elcho, who, though a gallant officer, the Prince may perhaps have\r\ntoo well conjectured, was not, even at that early period, a sincere and\r\nfirm adherent. To the Duke of Perth, on the contrary, the ill-fated\r\nyoung Chevalier showed a marked respect, and sat for some moments on\r\nhorseback in St. Anne's Yard, whilst the Duke, like \"an intelligent\r\nfarmer, informed him of the different nature and produce of the\r\ndifferent parcels of ground.\"[234] Dressed, as he was, in the Highland\r\ngarb,--a blue sash wrought with gold coming over his shoulder, a green\r\nvelvet bonnet with a gold lace round it on his head, a white\r\ncockade,--the cross of St. Andrew on his breast, his hand resting on a\r\nsilver-hilted sword, and a pair of pistols on his saddle;--associated in\r\nthe minds of all around him with the remembrance of Scotland in her\r\nindependence, and of Scottish monarchs in their greatness, the\r\nenthusiasm which was inspired in a slow, but ardent people cannot be a\r\nmatter of surprise. Long did the remembrance of that day continue to be\r\ncherished, in mingled pride and sorrow! It is true, the opinions of men\r\ndiffered according to their secret bias. The Jacobites, who looked on\r\nthe young Prince, compared him to Robert the Bruce, to whom he bore,\r\nthey fancied, a resemblance. The Whigs beheld in him the gentleman of\r\nfashion, but not the hero and the conqueror. All parties seem to have\r\nremarked the dejection and languor of his manner as he prepared to enter\r\nthe palace of Holyrood.\r\n\r\nIt was, indeed, impossible, from the deportment of Charles on his first\r\nintroduction into Scotland, or from his conduct whilst his affairs\r\nprospered, to comprehend the strength of his determination, or to\r\ncalculate upon his power of endurance. In prosperity he was, it is true,\r\nbrave, courteous, often amiable, often generous, but sometimes betraying\r\nthe petulance and obstinacy which historians have been fond of\r\nconsidering as hereditary propensities in the heroic young man, but\r\nwhich are the common attributes of the inexperienced and the spoiled. In\r\nadversity he was meek, grateful, magnanimous; capable of forgetting his\r\nown unparalleled sufferings, in considering those of others; never\r\nbreathing an accent of revenge; rising above fortune. He resembled\r\nCharles the Second more in his hatred of shedding blood, than in his\r\nvices, which were in the young Chevalier the effect of circumstances,\r\nrather than of a depraved nature. He had the fortitude of Charles the\r\nFirst: in truth, and right intention he exceeded both of these his\r\nancestors; and in this, as in other respects, he showed more of the\r\nScottish character, more of the true sense of Highland honour, than any\r\nof his immediate predecessors in the Stuart line. Naturally gay, though\r\nvariable; quick and shrewd, rather than deep or strong in intellect;\r\neasily to be flattered, too easily led by some, too wilful in resisting\r\nthe counsels of others,--as a Prince, as the head of a Court, he soon\r\nwon upon the affections of the people who beheld him; but there were\r\nvital defects mingled with his great and good qualities, which well\r\nverified the saying of the Whigs, \"that he would prove neither a hero\r\nnor a conqueror.\"\r\n\r\nAs the Prince walked along the piazza close to the apartment of the Duke\r\nof Hamilton, a gentleman stepped out of the crowd, and, drawing his\r\nsword, raised his arm aloft, and walked up stairs before Charles Edward.\r\nThe remarkable person who thus signalized his loyalty was James Hepburn\r\nof Keith, a gentleman of learning and intelligence, whose Jacobitism was\r\nof a more enlightened description than that of the party with whom he\r\nthus identified himself. Since the insurrection of 1715, in which, when\r\na very young man, he had been engaged, Mr. Hepburn had become a\r\nprofessed Jacobite. Yet he disclaimed the hereditary, indefeasible right\r\nof Kings, and condemned the measures of James the Second. Cherishing\r\neven these opinions, he had nevertheless kept himself during twenty\r\nyears ready to take up arms for Charles Edward, from a hatred to the\r\nUnion between England and Scotland, a measure which he deemed injurious\r\nand humiliating to his country. Idolized by the Jacobites, beloved by\r\nsome of the Whigs, a \"model of ancient simplicity, manliness and\r\nhonour,\"[235] the accession of Hepburn to the Jacobite cause was\r\nlamented by those who esteemed him, and who saw in his notions of the\r\nindependence of Scotland only a visionary speculation.\r\n\r\nThe entrance of Prince Charles had taken place early in the day: soon\r\nafter noon he was proclaimed Regent at the ancient Cross of Edinburgh,\r\nand his father's manifesto was read in the same place. Six heralds in\r\ntheir robes, with a trumpet, came to the Cross, which was surrounded by\r\nthe brave Camerons in three ranks. The streets and windows were crowded\r\nto excess; whilst David Beato, a writing-master in Edinburgh, read the\r\npapers to the heralds. The beautiful Mrs. Murray of Broughton sat on\r\nhorseback with a drawn sword in her hand beside the Cross, her dress\r\ndecorated with the white ribbon which was the token of adherence to the\r\nHouse of Stuart. Whilst these events took place, a spectator in the\r\ncrowd, viewing clearly that all was the show of power, without the\r\nsubstantial capacity to perpetuate it, resolved to write the history of\r\nwhat, he foresaw, would be a short-lived though perhaps fierce contest.\r\nHe was not mistaken. This individual was Alexander Henderson.\r\n\r\nThe following account is given by Lord Elcho of the Chevalier's court\r\nduring the short time that he inhabited Holyrood House.[236]\r\n\r\n\"The Prince lived in Edinburgh, from the twenty-second of September to\r\nthe thirty-first of October, with great splendour and magnificence;--had\r\nevery morning a numerous court of his officers. After he had held a\r\ncouncil, he dined with his principal officers in public, where there was\r\nalways a crowd of all sorts of people to see him dine. After dinner he\r\nrode out, attended by his life-guards, and reviewed his army; where\r\nthere were always a great number of spectators, in coaches and on\r\nhorseback. After the review he came to the Abbey, where he received the\r\nladies of fashion that came to his drawing-room. Then he supped in\r\npublic; and generally there was music at supper, and a ball afterwards.\r\nBefore he left Edinburgh, he despatched Sir James Stewart to manage his\r\naffairs in the country and solicit succours.\"\r\n\r\nThis remarkable scene was soon followed by the battle of Preston Pans.\r\nThe memorable words of Charles Edward before the victory, \"I have flung\r\naway the scabbard!\" were followed by a total rout of the King's troops.\r\nThe Duke of Perth was appointed Lieutenant-general of the forces. After\r\nthe engagement which ensued, when the heat of the contest was over, he\r\ndistinguished himself in a manner in which every brave and loyal man\r\nwould wish to imitate his example,--by saving the lives of the\r\ncombatants. His tenantry, commanded by Lord Nairn, were among the most\r\neager of the combatants on that day. When the defeat of the King's\r\ntroops was manifest, a terrible carnage ensued. Some of the conquered\r\nthrew down their arms, and begged for quarter, which was refused them;\r\nothers, who fled into the enclosures, were murdered; and all who were\r\novertaken were cut in the most cruel manner by broad-swords and Lochaber\r\naxes.\r\n\r\nThe kind-hearted Duke of Perth, seeing this slaughter, made a signal to\r\nCameron of Lochiel to stop the impetuosity of his men; and sent his\r\naid-de-camp, or, as he was then called, his gentleman, for that purpose.\r\nNo sooner had the Duke done this, than he sprang himself upon a fleet\r\nbay mare, a racer, which had won the King's plate at Leith some years\r\nbefore; and, taking a Major of the King's troops along with him, \"shot\r\nlike an arrow through the field,\" and saved numbers: as also did his\r\ngentleman, Mr. Stuart.[237]\r\n\r\nBut these efforts were insufficient to prevent a cruel and terrible\r\ndestruction of some of the bravest and best of the British officers. In\r\nthe battle of Preston Pans fell the famous Colonel Gardiner. His fate\r\nwas, it is said, envied by General Cope, who, witnessing the destruction\r\nof his army, wished to have died on the field.\r\n\r\nWhilst the Highlanders were carried away to the house of Colonel\r\nGardiner, close by, the young Chevalier stood by the road-side, having\r\nsent to Edinburgh by the advice of the Duke of Perth for surgeons. At\r\nthis moment, Henderson, that spectator of the proclamation who had\r\nresolved to write a history of the war, having slept at Musselburgh,\r\nonly at two miles' distance, the night before, stepped forward to take a\r\nsurvey of the field. \"It was one scene of horror, capable,\" writes this\r\nhistorian,[238] \"of softening the hardest heart, being strewed not so\r\nmuch with the dead as with the wounded: the broken guns, halberts,\r\npikes, and canteens showing the work of the day. In the midst of this\r\ndistressing spectacle, an act of mercy shone forth, like a light from\r\nHeaven.\" \"Major Bowles,\" continues Henderson, \"of Hamilton's Dragoons,\r\nbeing dismounted, the enemy fell upon and wounded him in eleven\r\ndifferent places; and just as some inhuman wretch was fetching a stroke,\r\nwhich perhaps would have proved mortal, Mr. Stuart threw up his sword\r\nand awarded the blow.\"\r\n\r\nFrom Preston Pans Charles Edward rode to Pinkie House, a seat of the\r\nMarquis of Tweedale. In the elation of victory, a consideration which\r\ncan alone excuse the disregard of the sufferings of others which the\r\nforegoing narrative states, the Prince is said to have left the bulk of\r\nthe wounded upon the field until the next day, when they were brought in\r\ncarts to the infirmary of Edinburgh. The neighbourhood was afterwards\r\nscattered over with the wounded who recovered, and who begged throughout\r\nthe country, where they met with kindness and humanity from all, except\r\nfrom the Adventurers, as they were called. Such is the testimony of one\r\nwho has not failed to bear witness to acts of humanity where they really\r\nexisted; and it would be unfair to suppress the statements of\r\ncontemporaries on either side of the question. At the same time, this\r\naccount is wholly at variance with the deep sorrow afterwards betrayed\r\nby Charles when he spoke of the sufferings of the Scottish people on his\r\naccount; nor is it consistent with the sensibility and humanity evinced,\r\nas the same historian avows, by the Duke of Perth.[239]\r\n\r\nUpon the return of Prince Charles to Edinburgh, in order to carry on\r\naffairs with every appearance of royalty, he appointed a council, who\r\nmet every day at Holyrood House at ten o'clock for the despatch of\r\nbusiness. The members of this council were the two Lieutenants-general,\r\nthe Duke of Perth, and Lord George Murray, who had been appointed in\r\nconjunction with the former; Secretary Murray; Sullivan,\r\nQuarter-master-general; Lord Pitsligo, Lord Elcho, Sir Thomas Sheridan,\r\nand all the Highland chiefs.\r\n\r\nThe fine characteristics, and powerful mind of Lord George Murray, and\r\nthe prominent part which he took in the insurrection, demand a long and\r\nseparate account. Among the rest of this ill-starred council, the\r\nprincipal members in point of rank, if not of influence, were Alexander,\r\nLord Forbes of Pitsligo, who, after the battle of Preston, joined the\r\nPrince's standard with a troop of a hundred horse. The character of this\r\nnobleman gave his example a great influence among all who knew him, and\r\nwho respected the ardent piety, bordering upon fanaticism, which\r\ncharacterized his religious sentiments, and the heartfelt earnestness\r\nof his political opinions. Early in life this venerable man had sworn\r\nallegiance to William the Third, and taken his seat in Parliament; he\r\nbecame, however, an opponent to the Union, and, from the period of that\r\nmeasure, his course was a decided system of calm and steady adherence to\r\nJacobite principles. He engaged in the rebellion of 1715, yet by the\r\nforbearance of Government was permitted to retain his title and estate.\r\nHe now again embarked in the same adventurous cause, leaving the study\r\nof moral philosophy, on which he had written several essays, and the\r\nsecurity of a private career, for the sake of conscience. No hope of\r\ngain, no inducement of ambition, lured this adherent of Charles Edward\r\nto the standard of the Stuarts. Aged, and so infirm that he was\r\ncompelled by his bodily weakness to accept the generous proposal of\r\nCharles Edward to travel on all the marches in the Prince's carriage,\r\nwhilst the Chevalier walked at the head of his army, Lord Pitsligo again\r\ncame forward at what he conceived to be the dictates of duty. His\r\nexample drew many others into the undertaking. Of course, his subsequent\r\nhistory closed in the usual melancholy manner: his life was, it is true,\r\nspared; but his estates were forfeited, and his title extinguished. He\r\ndied at Auchiries, in Aberdeenshire.\r\n\r\nDavid, Lord Elcho, who held also a place in the council, and who was\r\ncolonel of the first troop of Horseguards, was the son of James, fourth\r\nEarl of Wemyss, and of Janet the daughter of Colonel Francis Charteris\r\nof Amisfield, whose immense property was afterwards vested in the Wemyss\r\nfamily. Lord Elcho was at this time only twenty-four years of age, and\r\ntherefore his appointment to the colonelcy of the horse was a signal\r\ncompliment to his abilities. Of his personal character much may be\r\ngleaned from his unpublished narrative, written in a dry, caustic, and\r\nuninspiring style; and penned by one who seems to have desired to do\r\njustice, but whose personal dislike to the young Chevalier over-masters\r\nhis inclination to the cause. Notwithstanding a plain disapproval of\r\nmany measures, and a marked conviction of the wilfulness of his young\r\nleader, Lord Elcho was true to the cause which he had adopted. His\r\naccount of the manner in which the council of the Regent, as he was\r\nstyled, was conducted, is so characteristic, not only of those to whom\r\nhe refers, but of his own mind, that I shall give it in the unvarnished\r\nphraseology in which he composed it.[240]\r\n\r\n\"The Prince in his council used always first to declare what he was for,\r\nand then he asked everybody's opinion in their turn. There was one-third\r\nof the council whose principles were, that Kings and Princes can never\r\neither act, or think wrong; so, in consequence, they always confirmed\r\nwhatever the Prince said. The other two-thirds, who thought that Kings\r\nand Princes thought sometimes like other men, and were not altogether\r\ninfallible, and that this Prince was no more so than others, begged\r\nleave to differ from him, when they could give sufficient reasons for\r\ntheir difference of opinion, which very often was no hard matter to do;\r\nfor as the Prince and his old governor, Sir Thomas Sheridan, were\r\naltogether ignorant of the ways and customs in Great Britain, and both\r\nmuch for the doctrine of absolute monarchy, they would very often, had\r\nthey not been prevented, have fallen into blunders which might have hurt\r\nthe cause. The Prince could not bear to hear anybody differ in sentiment\r\nfrom him, and took a dislike to everybody that did; for he had a notion\r\nof commanding this army, as any general does a body of mercenaries, and\r\nso let them know only what he pleased, and they obey without inquiring\r\nfurther about the matter. This might have done better had his favourites\r\nbeen people of the country; but they were Irish, and had nothing at\r\nstake. The Scotch, who ought to be supposed to give the best advice they\r\nwere capable of giving, thought they had a little right to know, and be\r\nconsulted in what was for the good of the cause in which they had so\r\nmuch concern; and, if it had not been for their insisting strongly upon\r\nit, the Prince, when he found that his sentiments were not always\r\napproved of, would have abolished his council long ere he did. There was\r\na very good paper sent one day by a gentleman in Edinburgh, to be\r\nperused by this council. The Prince, when he heard it read, said that it\r\nwas below his dignity to enter into such a reasoning with subjects, and\r\nordered the paper to be laid aside. The paper afterwards was printed\r\nunder the title of the Prince's Declaration to the People of England,\r\nand is esteemed the best manifesto published in those times; for the\r\nones that were printed at Rome and Paris were reckoned not well\r\ncalculated for the present age.\"\r\n\r\nBefore the Prince had left Edinburgh, intrigues had begun to distract\r\nhis councils. \"An ill-timed emulation,\" remarks an eye-witness of the\r\nrebellion, \"soon crept in, and bred great dissension and animosities:\r\nthe council was insensibly divided into factions, and came to be of\r\nlittle use, when measures were approved of, or condemned, not for\r\nthemselves, but for the sake of their author.\"[241] Unhappily, the Duke\r\nof Perth, amiable, but inexperienced and unsuspecting, confided in one\r\nwhose machinations, guided by an unbounded love of rule, eventually\r\naccelerated the ruin of the cause.\r\n\r\nThe very name of Murray of Broughton recalls with a shudder the\r\nremembrance of selfish ambition and treachery. This unprincipled man,\r\nprivate secretary to Charles Edward, had a remarkable influence over the\r\nyoung Chevalier's mind; an influence acquired during a long and intimate\r\nacquaintance abroad. \"He was,\" observes Mr. Maxwell, \"the only personal\r\nacquaintance the Prince found in Scotland.\" To a desire of having the\r\nsole government of the Prince's council he \"sacrificed what chance there\r\nwas of a restoration, although upon that all his hopes were built.\" The\r\nexpedition to Scotland and England was, according to the same authority,\r\nthe entire suggestion of Murray; and the credit of that success which\r\nhad hitherto attended the attempt, was now solely attributed to the\r\nsecretary's advice. \"The Duke of Perth,\" adds the same writer, \"judging\r\nof Murray's heart by his own, entertained the highest opinion of his\r\nintegrity, went readily into all his schemes, and confirmed the Prince\r\nin the esteem he had already conceived for Murray.\"\r\n\r\nThe man whom Murray most dreaded as a rival was Lord George Murray, the\r\ncoadjutor with the Duke of Perth in the command of the army; and it soon\r\nbecame no difficult task, not only to persuade Prince Charles, who knew\r\nbut little personally of Lord George, that that impetuous but honest man\r\nwas a traitor, but also to inspire the amiable Duke of Perth with\r\nsuspicions foreign to his generous nature. Few of the calm spectators of\r\nthe struggle were very sanguine as to its result; but the moderate hopes\r\nwhich they dared to entertain were all dashed to the ground by the\r\nunbridled love of sway which the secretary indulged, and which filled\r\nhim with a base and bitter enmity towards men of talent and influence.\r\nToo truly is the effect of his representations told in these few and\r\nsimple words, written by one who was devotedly attached to the misled,\r\nconfiding Charles, upon whose ignorance of the world Murray condescended\r\nto practise.[242]\r\n\r\n\"All those gentlemen that joined the Prince after Murray, were made\r\nknown under the character he thought fit to give them; and all\r\nemployments about the Prince's person, and many in the army, were of his\r\nnomination. These he filled with such as he had reason to think would\r\nnever thwart his measures, but be content to be his tools and creatures\r\nwithout aspiring higher. Thus, some places of the greatest trust were\r\ngiven to little insignificant fellows; while there were abundance of\r\ngentlemen of figure and merit that had no employment at all, and who\r\nmight have been of great use, had they been properly employed. Those\r\nthat Murray had thus placed, seconded his little dirty views: it was\r\ntheir interest, too, to keep their betters at a distance from the\r\nPrince's person and acquaintance. These were some of the disadvantages\r\nthe Prince laboured under during this whole expedition.\"\r\n\r\nAs soon as the expedition into England was decided, a gentleman was\r\ndispatched to France to hasten the assistance expected from that\r\nquarter. The first intention of the insurgents was to march to\r\nNewcastle, and give battle to General Wade; then to proceed, if the\r\nPrince proved victorious, by the eastern coast to England, in order to\r\nfavour the expected landing of the French upon that side. This scheme\r\nwas overruled by Lord George Murray, with what success history has\r\ndeclared. It was natural, when all was lost, for those who wished well\r\nto the cause, to retrace their steps, and to desire that any measures\r\nhad been adopted, rather than those which had proved so disastrous: but\r\nthis is the common feeling of regret, and cannot be relied on as the\r\nsober dictate of judgment.\r\n\r\nOn his departure from Edinburgh, the young Chevalier was followed by the\r\ngood will of many who had viewed his arrival with regret. The people,\r\nsays Maxwell of Kirkconnel, \"were affected with the dangers they\r\napprehended he might be exposed to, and doubtful whether they ever\r\nshould see him again.\"[243] \"Everybody was mightily taken,\" adds the\r\nsame writer, \"with the Prince's figure and personal behaviour. There was\r\nbut one voice about them.\" What was still more important, the short\r\nduration of military rule exercised by Charles Edward had been so\r\nconducted as to create no disgust. The guard of the city had been\r\nentrusted to Cameron of Lochiel, the younger; and under his firm and\r\njudicious controul, the persons and effects of the citizens, had been as\r\nsecure as in time of peace. \"The people had the pleasure of seeing the\r\nwhole apparatus of war, without feeling the effects of it.\"[244] Day\r\nafter day some new and graceful instance of the humanity and kindness of\r\nthe young Chevalier's disposition had transpired. At this period of his\r\nlife there was a degree of magnanimity in the sentiments of one, of\r\nwhose principles despair, and the desertion of his friends afterwards\r\nmade such a wreck. The following trait of this ill-fated young man is\r\ntoo beautiful--it reflects too much credit, through him, upon the party\r\nof whom he was the head--to be omitted; more especially as the narrative\r\nfrom which it is taken is not in the hands of general readers.\r\n\r\n\"But what gave people the highest idea of him was, the negative he gave\r\nto a thing that very nearly concerned his interest, and upon which the\r\nsuccess of his enterprise perhaps depended. It was proposed to send one\r\nof the prisoners to London, to demand of that court a cartel for the\r\nexchange of prisoners taken and to be taken during this war, and to\r\nintimate that a refusal would be looked upon as a resolution on their\r\npart to give no quarter. It was visible a cartel would be of great\r\nadvantage to the Prince's affairs: his friends would be more ready to\r\ndeclare for him, if they had nothing to fear but the chance of war in\r\nthe field; and, if the Court of London refused to settle a cartel, the\r\nPrince was authorised to treat his prisoners in the same manner that the\r\nElector of Hanover was determined to treat such of the Prince's friends\r\nas might fall into his hands. It was urged, a few examples would compel\r\nthe Court of London to comply. It was to be presumed that the officers\r\nof the English army would make a point of it. They had never engaged in\r\nthe service, but upon such terms as are in use among all civilized\r\nnations, and it would be no stain on their honour to lay down their\r\ncommissions if these terms were not observed; and, that, owing to the\r\nobstinacy of their own Prince. Though this scheme was plausible, and\r\nrepresented as very important, the Prince could never be brought into\r\nit; it was below him to make empty threats, and he would never put such\r\nas those into execution; he would never, in cold blood, take away lives\r\nwhich he had saved in heat of action at peril of his own.\"[245]\r\n\r\nOn the thirty-first of October, the Prince set out from Holyrood House\r\nin the evening, amid a crowd of people assembled to bid him farewell. On\r\nthe following day he joined one column of his army at Dalkeith. The army\r\nmarched in two columns, by different roads, to Carlisle: that which the\r\nPrince commanded, and which was conducted by Lord George Murray, was\r\ncomposed of the Guards, and the Clans; Charles Edward marched on foot at\r\nthe head of the Highlanders, and the Guards led the van. The other\r\ncolumn went by Peebles and Moffat, having with them the artillery and\r\nheavy baggage. It was composed of the Atholl brigade, the Duke of\r\nPerth's regiment, Lord Ogilvie, of Glenbucket, and Roy Stuart's\r\nregiment. The greater part of the horse was commanded by the Duke of\r\nPerth. A week afterwards these two columns were re-united, and the\r\ntroops were quartered in villages to the west of Carlisle.\r\n\r\nOn the thirteenth of October the town of Carlisle was invested by the\r\nDuke of Perth and Lord George Murray, with the horse and Lowland\r\nregiments. The conduct of the Duke of Perth, during the siege of five\r\ndays which ensued, has been a subject of eulogy for every writer who has\r\nundertaken to relate the affairs of the period. The siege was attempted\r\nin the face of many difficulties, the Prince having no battering cannon;\r\nso that, if the town had been well defended, it would have been found\r\nimpossible to reduce it: still, being a place of great strength, and the\r\nkey to England, he resolved to make the attempt.\r\n\r\nIt was in this undertaking that the Duke of Perth reaped the benefit of\r\nhis scientific knowledge of the art of war, and that he showed a degree\r\nof skill as well as of military ardour, which would, had his life been\r\nspared, have rendered him an excellent general. The castle of Carlisle,\r\nbuilt upon the east angle of the fortifications, was of course the\r\nobject of his attack. On Tuesday, the thirteenth of October, after his\r\nreturn from Brampton, where the Prince remained with the Clans to cover\r\nthe siege, the Duke began his operations. His officers had forced four\r\ncarpenters to go along with them in order to assist in erecting the\r\nbatteries. In short, all ablebodied men were seized on by the\r\ninsurgents, and those who had horses and ladders were constrained to\r\ncarry them to the siege of Carlisle.\r\n\r\nThe Duke then \"broke ground,\" to use a military expression, about three\r\nhundred yards from the citadel, at the Spring Garden; and encountered\r\nthe fire of the cannon from the town, approaching so near that the\r\ngarrison even threw grenadoes at them. On Wednesday, the trenches were\r\nopened, and were conducted by Mr. Grant, chief engineer, whose skill was\r\ngreatly commended. On Friday morning, batteries were erected within\r\nforty fathoms of the walls. During all this time the cannon and small\r\narms from the castle played furiously, but with so little destruction to\r\nthe besiegers, that only two men were killed.\r\n\r\nThe weather was so intensely cold, that even the Highlanders could\r\nscarcely sustain its inclemency; yet the Duke of Perth and the Marquis\r\nof Tullibardine, the one delicate in constitution, the other broken and\r\nin advancing age, worked at the trenches like any common labourer, in\r\ntheir shirts. On the Friday, when the cannon began to play, and the\r\nscaling-ladders were brought out for an assault, a white flag was hung\r\nout, and the city offered to surrender. An express was sent to the\r\nChevalier at Brampton; whose answer was, \"that he would not do things by\r\nhalves,\" and that the city had no reason to expect terms, unless the\r\ncastle surrendered also. That event took place, in consequence,\r\nimmediately; and the capitulation was signed by the Duke of Perth, and\r\nby Colonel Durand, who had been sent from London to defend Carlisle. In\r\nthe afternoon of the same day, the Duke of Perth entered the town, and\r\ntook possession in the name of James the Third, whose manifesto was\r\nread; the mayor and aldermen attending the Duke, the sword and mace\r\nbeing carried before them.\r\n\r\nThe Duke of Perth won many of those who were enemies to Charles Edward,\r\nover to his cause, by the humanity and civility with which he treated\r\nthe conquered citizens, over whom he had the chief command until Charles\r\narrived. But even the important advantage thus gained could not still\r\nthe animosities which had been kindled in the breasts of those who ought\r\nto have laid aside all private considerations for the good of their\r\ncommon undertaking. Hitherto Lord George Murray and the Duke of Perth\r\nhad had separate commands, and had not interfered with each other until\r\nthe siege of Carlisle. Here the Duke had acted as the chief in command;\r\nhe had directed the attack, signed the capitulation, and given orders in\r\nthe town until the Prince arrived. This was a precedent for the whole\r\ncampaign, and it ill-suited the fiery temper of Lord George Murray to\r\nbrook it tamely. There was, indeed, much to be said in favour of Lord\r\nGeorge's alleged wrongs, in this preference of one so young and\r\ninexperienced as the Duke of Perth. In the first place, Lord George was\r\nan older Lieutenant-General than his rival; nor could it be agreeable to\r\nhis Lordship to serve under a man so much his inferior in age and\r\nexperience. \"Lord George,\" observes Mr. Maxwell, \"thought himself the\r\nfittest man to be at the head of the army; nor was he the only person\r\nthat thought so. Had it been left to the gentlemen of the army to choose\r\na general, Lord George would have carried it by vast odds against the\r\nDuke of Perth.\" But there was still another pretext, which was insisted\r\nupon as a reason less offensive to the Duke of Perth, whose gentle and\r\nnoble qualities had much endeared him even to those who did not wish to\r\nsee him chief in command; this was his religious persuasion. It was\r\nargued that, at that time in England, Roman Catholics were excluded from\r\nall employments, civil and military, by laws anterior to the Revolution;\r\nit was contended that these laws, whether just or not, ought to be\r\ncomplied with until they were repealed; and that a defiance of these\r\nlaws would confirm all that had been heard of old from the press and\r\nfrom the pulpit, of the Prince's designs to subvert both Church and\r\nState: neither could it be alleged in excuse for the young Prince, that\r\na superiority of genius or of experience had won this distinction, in\r\nopposition to custom, for the Duke of Perth.\r\n\r\nWhilst these murmurs distracted the camp, immediately after the\r\nsurrender of Carlisle, Lord George Murray resigned his commission of\r\nLieutenant-General, and informed the Prince that thenceforth he would\r\nserve as a volunteer. Upon this step, Mr. Maxwell, who seems to have\r\nknown intimately the merits of the case, makes the following temperate\r\nand beautiful reflection.[246] \"It would be rash in me to pretend to\r\ndetermine whether ambition, or zeal for the Prince's service, determined\r\nLord George to take this step; or, if both had a share in it, which was\r\npredominant: it belongs to the Searcher of hearts to judge of an action\r\nwhich might have proceeded from very different motives.\"\r\n\r\nUnder these circumstances, violent discussions took place in the army;\r\nand the result was, the wise resolution on the part of a certain\r\nofficer, not improbably Mr. Maxwell himself, to represent the\r\nconsequences of these altercations to the Duke of Perth. The undertaking\r\nwas one of delicacy and difficulty; but the individual who undertook it\r\nhad not miscalculated the true gentlemanly humility, the real dignity\r\nand disinterestedness, of the gallant man to whom he addressed himself.\r\nThe narrative goes on as follows:\r\n\r\n\"A gentleman who had been witness to such conversation, and dreaded\r\nnothing so much as dissension in a cause which could never succeed but\r\nby unanimity, resolved to speak to the Duke of Perth upon this\r\nungrateful subject. He had observed that those that were loudest in\r\ntheir complaints were least inclined to give themselves any trouble in\r\nfinding out a remedy.\"\r\n\r\n\"The Duke, who at this time was happy, but not elevated, upon his\r\nsuccess, reasoned very coolly on the matter. He could never be convinced\r\nthat it was unreasonable that he should have the principal command; but\r\nwhen it was represented to him, that since that opinion prevailed,\r\nwhether well or ill founded, the Prince's affairs might equally suffer,\r\nhe took his resolution in a moment; said he never had anything in view\r\nbut the Prince's interest, and would cheerfully sacrifice everything to\r\nit. And he was as good as his word; for he took the first opportunity of\r\nacquainting the Prince with the complaints that were against him,\r\ninsisted upon being allowed to give up his command, and to serve\r\nhenceforth at the head of his regiment.\"\r\n\r\nAfter his resignation, the Duke of Perth sank gracefully into the duties\r\nof the post assigned to him. But his ardour in the cause was unsubdued;\r\nand he was frequently known, during the march from Carlisle to Derby, to\r\nride down three horses a day when information of the enemy was to be\r\nprocured.\r\n\r\nThe short sojourn of the Prince at Derby, and the inglorious retreat,\r\nhave been detailed by the various biographers and historians of that\r\nperiod; but, amongst the various accounts which have been given, that\r\nwhich is contained in a letter from Derby has not hitherto been\r\npresented to the reader, except in a collection rarely to be met with,\r\nand now but little known.[247]\r\n\r\nOn Wednesday, the 4th of December (1745), two of the insurgents entered\r\nthe town, inquired for the magistrates, and demanded billets for nine\r\nthousand men, and more. A short time afterwards the vanguard broke into\r\nthe town, consisting of about thirty men, clothed in blue faced with\r\ngold, and scarlet waistcoats with gold lace; and, being \"likely men,\"\r\nthey made a good appearance. They were drawn up in the market-place, and\r\nremained there two hours; at the same time the bells were rung, and\r\nbonfires were lighted, in order to do away with the impression that the\r\nChevalier's vanguard had been received disrespectfully. About three\r\no'clock Lord Elcho, on horseback, arrived at the head of the\r\nLife-guards, about one hundred and fifty men, the flower of the army,\r\nwho rode gallantly into the town, dressed like the vanguard, making a\r\nvery fine display. The Guards were followed by the main body of the\r\narmy, who marched in tolerable order, two or three abreast, with eight\r\nstandards, mostly having white flags and a red cross; the bag-pipers\r\nplaying as they entered. Whilst they were in the market-place, they\r\ncaused the Chevalier to be proclaimed King, and then asked for the\r\nmagistrates. These functionaries appeared without their gowns of office,\r\nhaving cautiously sent them out of the town; a circumstance which was\r\nwith some difficulty excused by the insurgents.\r\n\r\nIn the dusk of the evening Charles Edward arrived: he walked on foot,\r\nattended by many of his men, who followed him to Exeter House, where the\r\nPrince remained until his retreat northwards. Here he had guards placed\r\nall round the house, and here he maintained the semblance of a Court, in\r\nthe very heart of that country which he so longed to enter.\r\n\r\nThe temporary abode of Charles Edward still remains in perfect repair,\r\nand much in the same state, with the exception of change of furniture,\r\nas when he held levees there. Exeter House at that time belonged to\r\nBrownlow, Earl of Exeter, whose connexion with the town of Derby was\r\nowing to his marriage with a lady of that city. The house stands back\r\nfrom Full Street, and is situated within a small triangular court. An\r\nair of repose, notwithstanding the noise of a busy and important town,\r\ncharacterizes this interesting dwelling. It is devoid of pretension; its\r\ngables and chimneys proclaim the Elizabethan period. A wide staircase,\r\nrising from a small hall, leads to a square, oak-panelled drawing-room,\r\nthe presence-chamber in the days of the ill-fated Charles. On either\r\nside are chambers, retaining, as far as the walls are concerned, much of\r\nthe character of former days, but furnished recently. One of these\r\nserved the Prince as a sleeping-room; the rest were occupied by his\r\nofficers of state, and by such of his retinue as could be accommodated\r\nin a house of moderate size. The tenement contains many small rooms and\r\nclosets, well adapted, had there been need, for concealment and escape.\r\n\r\nThe back of Exeter House is picturesque in the extreme. The character of\r\nthe building is here more distinctly ancient; and its architecture is\r\nuniform, though simple. Beyond the steps by which you descend from a\r\nspacious dining-room, is a long lawn, enclosed between high walls, and\r\nextending to the brink of the river Derwent. A tradition prevails in\r\nDerby, that, after the retreat, one of the Highland officers who had\r\nbeen left behind, hearing of the approach of the Duke of Cumberland's\r\narmy, escaped through this garden, and, plunging into the river, swam\r\ndown its quiet waters for a considerable distance, until he gained a\r\npart of the opposite shore where he thought he might land without\r\ndetection. Another more interesting association connects the spot with\r\nthe poet Dr. Darwin, who is said to have planted some willows which grow\r\non the opposite side of the river to Exeter House.\r\n\r\nHere Charles remained for some days. The Dukes of Atholl and Perth, and\r\nthe other noblemen who commanded regiments, together with Lady Ogilvie\r\nand Mrs. Murray of Broughton, were lodged in the best gentlemen's\r\nhouses. Every house was tolerably well filled; but the Highlanders\r\ncontinued pouring in till ten or eleven o'clock, until the burgesses of\r\nDerby began to think they \"should never have seen the last of them.\" \"At\r\ntheir coming in,\" says the writer of the letter referred to, \"they were\r\ngenerally treated with bread, cheese, beer and ale, while all hands were\r\naloft getting supper ready. After supper, being weary with their long\r\nmarch, they went to rest, most upon straw-beds, some in beds.\" On Friday\r\nmorning, only two days after the minds of the inhabitants had been\r\nagitated by the arrival of the Jacobites, they heard the drums beat to\r\narms, and the bag-pipers playing about the town. It was supposed that\r\nthis was a summons to a march to Loughborough, on the way to London; but\r\na very different resolution had been adopted.\r\n\r\nThe Prince's council had, the very morning before, met to advise their\r\ninexperienced leader as to the steps which he might deem it advisable to\r\ntake. The memorable decision to return to the north was not arrived at\r\nwithout a painful scene, such as those who felt deeply the situation of\r\nthe Chevalier could never forget. The sentiments with which the ardent\r\nyoung man listened to the proposal are thus detailed by Mr. Maxwell. The\r\nstatement at once exonerates the Prince of two faults with which his\r\nmemory has been taxed, those of cowardice and obstinacy. To a coward the\r\ngreat risk of advancing would have appeared in strong colours. An\r\nobstinate man would never have yielded to the arguments which were\r\nproffered. The description which Maxwell gives of the Prince's\r\nflatterers is such as too fatally applies to the generality of those who\r\nhave not the courage to be sincere.[248]\r\n\r\n\"The Prince, naturally bold and enterprising, and hitherto successful in\r\neverything, was shocked with the mention of a retreat. Since he set out\r\nfrom Edinburgh, he had never a thought but of going on, and fighting\r\neverything he found in his way to London. He had the highest idea of the\r\nbravery of his own men, and a despicable opinion of his enemies: he had\r\nhitherto had reason for both, and was confirmed in these notions by some\r\nof those who were nearest his person. These sycophants, more intent upon\r\nsecuring his favour than promoting his interest, were eternally saying\r\nwhatever they thought would please, and never hazarded a disagreeable\r\ntruth.\"[249]\r\n\r\nThe Duke of Perth coincided, on this occasion, with Charles in wishing\r\nto advance; or, to use the words of Lord George Murray, \"the Duke of\r\nPerth was for it, since his Royal Highness was.\"[250] It now seems to be\r\nadmitted that the judgment of the strong mind of Lord George Murray was\r\nless sound in this instance than the opinion of those who were more\r\nguided by feeling than by reflection, less cautious than the sagacious\r\nGeneral, less willing and less able to balance the arguments on either\r\nside.[251]\r\n\r\n\"There are not a few,\" remarks Mr. Maxwell, \"who still think the Prince\r\nwould have carried his point had he gone on from Derby. They built much\r\nupon the confusion there was at London, and the panic which prevailed\r\namong the Elector's troops at this juncture. It is impossible to decide\r\nwith any degree of certainty whether he would or would not have\r\nsucceeded; that depended upon the disposition of the Army, and of the\r\nCity of London, ready to declare for the Prince.\"\r\n\r\nNever had the soldiery been in greater spirits than during their stay at\r\nDerby; but the deepest dejection prevailed, when, in spite of some\r\nmanoeuvres to deceive them, they found themselves on the road to\r\nAshbourn. The despair and disgust of the Prince were as painful to\r\nbehold, as they were natural. He had played for the highest stake, and\r\nlost it. Yet one there was who could look on the drooping figure of the\r\ndisconsolate young man as he followed the van of the army, and attribute\r\nto ill-humour the dejection of that ardent and generous mind. The\r\nfollowing is an extract from Lord Elcho's narrative.\r\n\r\n\"Doncaster.--The Prince, who had marched all the way to Derby on foot at\r\nthe head of a column of infantry, now mounted on horseback, and rode\r\ngenerally after the van of the army, and appeared to be out of humour.\r\nUpon the army marching out of Derby, Mr. Morgan, an English gentleman,\r\ncame up to Mr. Vaughan, who was riding in the Life-guards, and after\r\nsaluting him said, 'D---- me, Vaughan, they are going to Scotland!' Mr.\r\nVaughan replied, 'Wherever they go, I am determined, now I have joined\r\nthem, to go along with them.' Upon which Mr. Morgan said with an oath,\r\n'I had rather be _hanged_ than go to Scotland to _starve_.' Mr. Morgan\r\n_was hanged_ in 1746; and Mr. Vaughan is an officer in Spain.\"[252]\r\n\r\nIn six days afterwards the Jacobite army arrived at Preston, and from\r\nthis place, where the Prince halted, he sent the Duke of Perth to\r\nScotland to summon his friends from Perth to join him, in order to renew\r\nthe attack upon England. The Prince was resolved to retire only until he\r\nmet that reinforcement, and then to march to London, be the consequence\r\nwhat it would.[253] But this scheme, so dearly cherished by Charles, was\r\nimpracticable. The Duke of Perth, taking with him an escort of seventy\r\nor eighty horse, set out for Kendal. He was assailed as he passed\r\nthrough that place by a mob, which he dispersed by firing on them, and\r\nresumed his march; but near Penrith he was attacked by a far more\r\nformidable force in a band of militia both horse and foot, greatly\r\nsuperior in numbers to his troops, and was obliged to retire to Kendal.\r\nOn the fifteenth he rejoined the Prince's army, after this fruitless\r\nattempt. The retreat of the Prince's army, managed as it was with\r\nconsummate skill by Lord George Murray, continued without any division\r\nof the forces until they had passed the river Esk. There the army\r\nseparated; and the Duke of Perth commanding one column of the army took\r\nthe eastern line to Scotland, while Charles marched to Annan in\r\nDumfrieshire.\r\n\r\nThe siege of Stirling is the next event of note in which we find the\r\nDuke of Perth engaged. He here acted again as Lieutenant-General, and\r\ncommanded the siege. Here, too, the valour and fidelity of two other\r\nmembers of his family were again proved. Lord John Drummond, who had\r\nlanded in Scotland while the Jacobites were at Derby, with the French\r\nbrigade, was slightly wounded in the battle of Falkirk. He had the\r\nhonour of being near the Prince in the centre of the battle with his\r\ngrenadiers; and it was on his artillery and engineers that the Chevalier\r\nchiefly depended for success in reducing Stirling. Lord Strathallan had\r\nalso assembled his men, and joined the army.\r\n\r\nWhile the Prince's army were flushed with the victory of Falkirk, the\r\nalternative of again marching to London, or of continuing the siege of\r\nStirling, was discussed. The last-mentioned plan was unhappily adopted;\r\nand the Duke of Perth called upon General Blakeney to surrender. The\r\nanswer was, that the General had always hitherto been regarded as a man\r\nof honour, and that he would always behave himself as such, and would\r\nhold out the place as long as it was tenable. Upon this, fresh works\r\nwere erected; and Monsieur Mirabel, the chief engineer, gave it as his\r\nopinion that the castle would be reduced in a few days. The unfortunate\r\nresult of that ill-advised siege, and the consequent retreat of the\r\nPrince from Stirling, have been, with every appearance of reason, as\r\nmuch blamed as the retreat from Derby. It was a fatal resolution, and\r\none which was not adopted by the Prince without sincere reluctance, and\r\nnot until after a strong representation, signed at Falkirk by Lord\r\nGeorge Murray and by all the Clans, begging that his Royal Highness\r\nwould consent to retreat, had been presented to him. The great desertion\r\nthat had taken place since the battle was adduced as a reason for this\r\nmovement; and the siege of Stirling, it was also urged, must necessarily\r\nbe raised, on account of the inclemency of the weather, which the\r\nsoldiers could hardly bear in their trenches, and the impaired state of\r\nthe artillery.[254]\r\n\r\nThe winter was passed in a plan of operations, for which the generalship\r\nof Prince Charles, or rather the able judgment of Lord George Murray,\r\nhas been eulogized. Making the neighbourhood of Inverness the centre,\r\nfrom which he could direct all the operations of his various generals,\r\nthe Prince employed his army of eight thousand men extensively and\r\nusefully. The siege of Fort William was carried on by Brigadier\r\nStapleton; Lord George Murray had invested Blair Castle; Lord John\r\nDrummond was making head against General Bland; the Duke of Perth was in\r\npursuit of Lord Loudon. This portion of the operations was attended with\r\nso much difficulty and danger, that Charles must have entertained a high\r\nopinion of him to whom it was entrusted.\r\n\r\nLord Cromartie had been already sent to disperse, if possible, Lord\r\nLoudon's little army; but that skilful and estimable nobleman had\r\nsuccessfully eluded his adversary, who found it impossible either to\r\nentice him into an action, or to force him out of the country. Lord\r\nLoudon had taken up his quarters at Dornoch, on the frith which divides\r\nRosshire from Sutherland. Here he was secure, as Lord Cromartie had no\r\nboats. It was therefore deemed necessary to have two detachments; one to\r\nguard the passage of the frith, the other to go by the head of it. This\r\nwas a matter of some difficulty, for the Prince had at that time hardly\r\nas many men at Inverness as were necessary to guard his person. It was,\r\nhowever, essential to attack Lord Loudon, whose army cut off all\r\ncommunication with Caithness, whence the Prince expected provisions and\r\nmen. In this dilemma an expedient had been thought of some time\r\npreviously, and preparations had been made for it; but the execution was\r\nextremely dangerous. Mr. Maxwell gives the following account of it:[255]\r\n\r\n\"All the fishing-boats that could be got on the coast of Moray had been\r\nbrought to Findhorn; the difficulty was, to cross the frith of Moray\r\nunperceived by the English ships that were continually cruizing there:\r\nif the design was suspected, it could not succeed. Two or three\r\nNorth-country gentlemen, that were employed in this affair, had\r\nconducted it with great secrecy and expedition. All was ready at\r\nFindhorn when the orders came from Inverness to make the attempt, and\r\nthe enemy had no suspicion. Moir of Stoneywood set out with this little\r\nfleet in the beginning of the night, got safe across the frith of Moray,\r\nand arrived in the morning at Tain, where the Duke of Perth, whom the\r\nPrince had sent to command this expedition, was ready. The men were\r\nembarked with great despatch, and by means of a thick fog, which\r\nhappened very opportunely, got over to Sutherland without being\r\nperceived. The Duke of Perth marched directly to the enemies' quarters,\r\nand, after some disappointments, owing to his being the dupe of his good\r\nnature and politeness, succeeded in dispersing Lord Loudon's army: and\r\nthis era, in the opinion of Mr. Maxwell, is the finest part of the\r\nPrince's expedition.\" Henceforth, all was dismay and disaster.\r\n\r\nThe affairs of Charles Edward had now begun visibly to decline, for\r\nmoney, the sinews of the war, was not to be had; and the military chest,\r\nplundered, as it has been stated, by villains who robbed the Prince by\r\nfalse musters, was exhausted. The hopes of the Chevalier were in the\r\nlowest state, when the intelligence reached Inverness that the Duke of\r\nCumberland was advancing from Aberdeen to attack his forces. Upon\r\nreceiving these tidings, the Prince sent messengers far and wide to call\r\nin his scattered troops, expecting that he should be strong enough to\r\nventure a battle.\r\n\r\nThe Duke of Perth, who at that time commanded all the troops that were\r\nto the eastward of Inverness, was planted near the river Spey. When the\r\nenemy approached, he retired to Elgin. On the same day, the twelfth of\r\nApril 1746, the Duke of Cumberland passed the Spey, and encamped within\r\nthree or four miles of Elgin.\r\n\r\nThis retreat of the Duke of Perth has been severely condemned. It\r\nappears, however, that he, and Lord John Drummond who was with him,\r\ncould not muster two thousand five hundred men. The river, which was\r\nvery low, was fordable in many places; so much so, that the enemy might\r\nmarch a battalion in front. The Duke had no artillery, whilst the enemy\r\nhad a very good train. There was no possibility of sending\r\nreinforcements from Inverness; above all, says Mr. Maxwell, \"nothing was\r\nto be risked that might dishearten the common soldiers on the eve of a\r\ngeneral and decisive action.\"\r\n\r\nBut the same candid and experienced soldier acknowledges that the Duke\r\nof Perth remained too long at Nairn, whither he retired, and where the\r\nDuke of Cumberland advanced within a mile of the town, and followed the\r\nretiring army of Perth for a mile or two, though to no purpose, the\r\nfoot-soldiers being protected by Fitzjames's Horse. The delay at Nairn\r\nhas, it is true, been excused, on the grounds of a command from Prince\r\nCharles to the Duke of Perth and his brother not to retire too hastily\r\nbefore Cumberland, but to keep as near to him as was consistent with\r\ntheir safety. This message \"put them on their mettle, and well-nigh\r\noccasioned their destruction.\" The Duke of Perth continued to retreat,\r\nuntil he halted somewhat short of Culloden, where the Prince arrived\r\nthat evening, and took up his quarters at Culloden House.[256]\r\n\r\nThe following day was the fifteenth of April, the anniversary of that on\r\nwhich the Duke of Cumberland, the disgrace of his family, the\r\nhard-hearted conqueror of a brave and humane foe, first saw the light.\r\nIt was expected that he would choose his birth-day for the combat, but\r\nthe fatal engagement of Culloden was deferred until the following\r\nmorning.\r\n\r\nThe battle of Culloden was prefaced by a general sentiment of despair\r\namong those who shared its perils.\r\n\r\n\"This,\" says Mr. Maxwell,[257] referring to the morning of the\r\nengagement, \"was the first time the Prince, ever thought his affairs\r\ndesperate. He saw his little army much reduced, and half-dead with\r\nhunger and fatigue, and found himself under a necessity of fighting in\r\nthat miserable condition, for he would not think of a retreat; which he\r\nhad never yielded to but with the greatest reluctance, and which, on\r\nthis occasion, he imagined would disperse the few men he had, and put an\r\ninglorious end to his expedition. He resolved to wait for the enemy, be\r\nthe event what it would; and he did not wait long, for he had been but a\r\nfew hours at Culloden, when his scouts brought him word that the enemy\r\nwas within two miles, advancing towards the moor, where the Prince had\r\ndrawn up his army the day before. The men were scattered among the woods\r\nof Culloden, the greatest part fast asleep. As soon as the alarm was\r\ngiven, the officers ran about on all sides to rouse them, if I may use\r\nthe expression, among the bushes; and some went to Inverness, to bring\r\nback such of the men as hunger had driven there. Notwithstanding the\r\npains taken by the officers to assemble the men, there were several\r\nhundreds absent from the battle, though within a mile of it: some were\r\nquite exhausted, and not able to crawl; and others asleep in coverts\r\nthat had not been beat up. However, in less time than one could have\r\nimagined, the best part of the army was assembled, and formed on the\r\nmoor, where it had been drawn up the day before. Every corps knew its\r\npost, and went straight without waiting for fresh orders; the order of\r\nbattle was as follows: the army was drawn up in two lines; the first was\r\ncomposed of the Atholl brigade, which had the right; the Camerons,\r\nStuarts of Appin, Frazers, Macintoshes, Farquharsons, Chisholms, Perths,\r\nRoy Stuart's regiment, and the Macdonalds, who had the left.\"\r\n\r\nThe Highlanders, though faint with fatigue and want of sleep, forgot all\r\ntheir hardships at the approach of an enemy; and, as a shout was sent up\r\nfrom the Duke of Cumberland's army, they returned it with the spirit of\r\na valiant and undaunted people.\r\n\r\nThe order of battle was as follows: the right wing was commanded by Lord\r\nGeorge Murray, and the left by the Duke of Perth; the centre of the\r\nfirst line by Lord John Drummond, and the centre of the second by\r\nBrigadier Stapleton. There were five cannon on the right, and four on\r\nthe left of the army.[258]\r\n\r\nThe Duke of Perth had therefore, from his important command, the\r\nprivilege of spending the short period of existence, which, as the event\r\nproved, Providence allotted to him, in the service of a Prince whom he\r\nloved; whilst he had the good fortune to escape that responsibility\r\nwhich fell to the lot of his rival, Lord George Murray. The influence\r\nwhich that nobleman had acquired over the council of war had enabled him\r\nfar to eclipse the Duke of Perth in importance; but it was the fate of\r\nLord George Murray to pay a heavy penalty for that distinction.\r\n\r\nBut not only did the amiable and high-minded Duke of Perth calmly\r\nsurrender to one, who was esteemed a better leader than himself, the\r\npost of honour; but he endeavoured to reconcile to the indignity put\r\nupon them the fierce spirit of the Macdonalds, who were obliged to cede\r\ntheir accustomed place on the right to the Atholl men. \"If,\" said the\r\nDuke, \"you fight with your usual bravery, you will make the left wing a\r\nright wing; in which case I shall ever afterwards assume the honourable\r\nsurname of Macdonald.\"[259] The Duke's standard was borne, on this\r\noccasion, by the Laird of Comrie, whose descendant still shows the\r\nclaymore which his ancestors brandished; whilst the Duke exclaimed\r\naloud, \"Claymore!\"[260] Happy would it have been for Charles, had a\r\nsimilar spirit purified the motives of all those on whom he was fated to\r\ndepend!\r\n\r\nThe battle was soon ended! Half-an-hour of slaughter and despair\r\nterminated the final struggle of the Stuarts for the throne of Britain!\r\nDuring that fearful though brief[261] space, one thousand of the\r\nJacobites were killed; no quarter being given on either side. Exhausted\r\nby fatigue and want of food, the brave Highlanders fell thick as autumn\r\nleaves upon the blood-stained moor, near Culloden House. About two\r\nhundred only on the King's side perished in the encounter. During the\r\nwhole battle, taking into account the previous cannonading, the\r\nJacobites lost, as the prisoners afterwards stated, four thousand men.\r\nBut it was not until after the fury of the fight ceased, that the true\r\nhorrors of war really began. These may be said to consist, not in the\r\nardour of a strife in which the passions, madly engaged, have no check,\r\nnor stay; but in the cold, vindictive, brutal, and remorseless\r\nafter-deeds, which stamp for ever the miseries of a conflict upon the\r\nbroken hearts of the survivors.\r\n\r\n\"Exceeding few,\" says Mr. Maxwell, \"were made prisoners in the field of\r\nbattle, which was such a scene of horror and inhumanity as is rarely to\r\nbe met with among civilized nations. Every circumstance concurs to\r\nheighten the enormity of the cruelties exercised on this occasion; the\r\nshortness of the action, the cheapness of the victory, and, above all,\r\nthe moderation the Prince had shown during his prosperity,--the\r\nleniency, and even tenderness, with which he had always treated his\r\nenemies. But that which was done on the field of Culloden was but a\r\nprelude to a long series of massacres committed in cold blood, which I\r\nshall have occasion to mention afterwards.\"[262]\r\n\r\nThe Chevalier, leaving that part of the field upon which bodies in\r\nlayers of three or four deep were lying, rode along the moor in the\r\ndirection of Fort Augustus, where he passed the river of Nairn. He\r\nhalted, and held a conference with Sir Thomas Sheridan, Sullivan, and\r\nHay; and, having taken his resolution, he sent young Sullivan to the\r\ngentlemen who had followed him, and who were now pretty numerous.\r\nSheridan at first pretended to conduct them to the place where the\r\nPrince was to re-assemble his army; but, having ridden half a mile\r\ntowards Ruthven, he there stopped, and dismissed them all in the\r\nPrince's name, telling them it was the Prince's \"pleasure that they\r\nshould shift for themselves.\"\r\n\r\nThis abrupt and impolitic, not to say ungracious and unsoldier-like\r\nproceeding, has been justified by the necessity of the moment. There\r\nwere no magazines in the Highlands, in which an unusual scarcity\r\nprevailed. The Lowlanders, more especially, must have starved in a\r\ncountry that had not the means of supporting its own inhabitants, and of\r\nwhich they knew neither the roads nor the language. It is, however, but\r\ntoo probable, that various suspicions, which were afterwards dispelled,\r\nof the fidelity of the Scots, induced Charles to throw himself into the\r\nhands of his Irish attendants at this critical juncture.[263]\r\n\r\nThe Duke of Perth, with his brother Lord John Drummond, and Lord George\r\nMurray, with the Atholl men, and almost all the Low-country men who had\r\nbeen in the Jacobite army, retired to Ruthven, where they remained a\r\nshort time with two or three thousand men, but without a day's\r\nsubsistence. The leaders of this band finding it impossible to keep the\r\nmen together, and receiving no orders from the Prince, came to a\r\nresolution of separating. They took a melancholy farewell of each other,\r\nbrothers and companions in arms, and many of them united by ties of\r\nrelationship. The chieftains dispersed to seek places of shelter, to\r\nescape the pursuit of Cumberland's \"bloodhounds:\" the men went to their\r\nhomes.\r\n\r\nSuch is the statement of Maxwell of Kirkconnel, relative to the Duke of\r\nPerth: according to another account, the course which the Duke pursued\r\nwas the following:--\r\n\r\nHe is said to have been wounded in the back and hands in the battle, and\r\nto have fled with great precipitancy from the field of battle. He\r\nobtained, it is supposed, that shelter which, even under the most\r\ndangerous and disastrous circumstances, was rarely refused to the poor\r\nJacobites. The exact spot of his retreat has never been ascertained; yet\r\npersons living have been heard to say, that in the houses of their\r\ngrandfathers or ancestors, the Duke of Perth took refuge, until the\r\nvigilance of pursuit had abated. The obscurity into which this and other\r\nsubjects connected with 1745 have fallen, may be accounted for by the\r\napathy which, at the beginning of the present century existed concerning\r\nall subjects connected with the ill-starred enterprise of the Stuarts;\r\nand the loss of much interesting information, which the curiosity of\r\nmodern times would endeavour in vain to resuscitate, has been the\r\nresult.\r\n\r\nTradition, however, often a sure guide, and seldom, at all events,\r\nwholly erroneous, has preserved some trace of the unfortunate wanderer's\r\nadventures after all was at an end. As it might be expected, and as\r\ncommon report in the neighbourhood of Drummond Castle states, the Duke\r\nreturned to the protection of his own people. To them, and to his\r\nstately home, he was fondly attached, notwithstanding his foreign\r\neducation. On first going from Perth to join the insurrection, as he\r\nlost sight of his Castle, he turned round, and as if anticipating all\r\nthe consequences of that step, exclaimed, 'O! my bonny Drummond Castle,\r\nand my bonny lands!'\r\n\r\nThe personal appearance of the Duke was well known over all the country,\r\nfor he was universally beloved, and was in the practice of riding at the\r\nhead of his tenantry and friends, called in that neighbourhood 'his\r\nguards,' to Michaelmas Market at Crieff, the greatest fair in those\r\nparts; where thousands assembled to buy and sell cattle and horses. He\r\nwas therefore afterwards easily recognised, although in disguise.\r\n\r\n\"Sometime after the battle of Culloden,\" as the same authority\r\nrelates,[264] \"the Duke returned to Drummond Castle, where his mother\r\nusually resided; and lived there very privately, skulking about the\r\nwoods and in disguise; he was repeatedly seen in a female dress,\r\nbarefooted, and bare-headed. Once a party came to search the castle\r\nunexpectedly; he instantly got into a wall press or closet, or recess of\r\nsome sort, where a woman shut him in, and standing before it, remained\r\nmotionless till they left that room, to carry on the search, when he got\r\nout at a window and gained the retreats in the woods. After he had\r\nwithdrawn from Scotland, and settled in the north of England, he\r\noccasionally visited Strathearn.\"\r\n\r\nIn one of these visits he called, disguised as an old travelling\r\nsoldier, at Drummond Castle, and desired the housekeeper to show him the\r\nrooms of the mansion. She was humming the song of \"the Duke of Perth's\r\nLament,\" and having learnt the name of the song he desired her to sing\r\nit no more. When he got into his own apartment he cried out, \"This is\r\nthe Duke's own room;\" when, lifting his arm to lay hold of one of the\r\npictures, she observed he was in tears, and perceived better dress under\r\nhis disguise, which convinced her he was the Duke himself.[265]\r\n\r\nFor some time the Duke continued these wanderings, stopping now and then\r\nto gaze upon his Castle, the sight of which affected him to tears. \"It\r\nwas now,\" says the writer of the case of Thomas Drummond, \"that for\r\nobvious reasons, to elude discovery, the report of his death on\r\nshipboard or otherwise, would be propagated by his friends and\r\nencouraged by himself.\" It is stated upon the same evidence, that\r\ninstead of sailing to France, as it has been generally believed, the\r\nDuke fled to England; that he was conveyed on board a ship and landed at\r\nSouth Shields, a few miles only distant from Biddick, a small\r\nsequestered village, chiefly inhabited at that time by banditti, who set\r\nall authority at defiance. Biddick is situated near the river Wear, a\r\nfew miles from Sunderland; it was, at that time, both from situation and\r\nfrom the character of its inhabitants, a likely place for one flying\r\nfrom the power of the law to find a shelter; it was, indeed, a common\r\nretreat for the unfortunate and the criminal. That the Duke of Perth\r\nactually took refuge there for some time, is an assertion which has\r\ngained credence from the following reasons:--\r\n\r\nIn the first place: \"In the History, Directory, and Gazette of the\r\ncounties of Northumberland and Durham, and the town and counties of\r\nNewcastle-upon-Tyne, by William Parson and William White, two volumes,\r\n1827-28, the following passage occurs relating to Biddick, in the parish\r\nof Houghton-le-Spring:--\r\n\r\n\"It was here that the unfortunate James Drummond, commonly called Duke\r\nof Perth, took sanctuary after the rebellion of 1745-6, under the\r\nprotection of Nicholas Lambton, Esq., of South Biddick, where he died,\r\nand was buried at Pain-Shaw.\"\r\n\r\nIn the case of Thomas Drummond, (on whom I shall hereafter make some\r\ncomments,) letters stated to be from Lord John Drummond are referred\r\nto, and quoted in part. These are said to have been addressed by Lord\r\nJohn Drummond from Boulogne, to the Duke at Houghton-le-Spring. The\r\npassage quoted runs thus: \"I think you had better come to France, and\r\nyou would be out of danger; as I find you are living in obscurity at\r\nHoughton-le-Spring. I doubt that it is a dangerous place; you say it is\r\nreported that you died on your passage. I hope and trust you will still\r\nlive in obscurity.\" These expressions, which it must be owned have very\r\nmuch the air of being coined for the purpose, would certainly, were the\r\nsupposed letters authenticated, establish the fact of the Duke's retreat\r\nto Houghton-le-Spring.\r\n\r\nUpon the doubtful nature of the intelligence, which was alone gleaned by\r\nthe friends and relatives of the Duke of Perth, a superstructure of\r\nromance, as it certainly appears to be, was reared. The Duke was never,\r\nas it was believed, married; and in 1784 the estates were restored to\r\nhis kinsman, the Honourable John Drummond, who was created Baron Perth,\r\nand who died in 1800, leaving the estates, with the honour of\r\nchieftainship, to his daughter Clementina Sarah, now Lady Willoughby\r\nD'Eresby.\r\n\r\nIn 1831, a claimant to the honours and estates appeared in Thomas\r\nDrummond, who declared himself to be the grandson of James Duke of\r\nPerth; according to his account, the Duke of Perth on reaching Biddick,\r\ntook up his abode with a man named John Armstrong, a collier or pitman.\r\nThe occupation of this man was, it was stated, an inducement for this\r\nchoice on the part of the Duke, as in case of pursuit, the abyss at a\r\ncoal-pit might afford a secure retreat; since no one would dare to\r\nenter a coal-pit without the permission of the owners.\r\n\r\nThe Duke, it is stated in the case of Thomas Drummond, commenced soon\r\nafter his arrival at Biddick, the employment of a shoemaker, in order to\r\nlull suspicion; he lost money by his endeavours, and soon relinquished\r\nhis new trade. He is said to have become, in the course of time, much\r\nattached to the daughter of his host, John Armstrong, and to have\r\nmarried her at the parish church of Houghton-le-Spring, in 1749. He\r\nresided with his wife's family until his first child was born, when he\r\nremoved to the boat-house, a dwelling with the use and privilege of a\r\nferry-boat attached to it, and belonging to Nicholas Lambton, Esq. of\r\nBiddick; who, knowing the rank and misfortunes of the Duke, bestowed it\r\non him from compassion. Here he lived, and with the aid of a small\r\nhuckster's shop on the premises, supported a family, which in process of\r\ntime, amounted to six or seven children; two of whom, Mrs. Atkinson and\r\nMrs. Peters, aged women, but still in full possession of their\r\nintellect, have given their testimony to the identity of this shoemaker\r\nand huckster to the Duke of Perth.[266]\r\n\r\nThe papers, letters, documents and writings, a favourite diamond ring,\r\nand a ducal patent of nobility, were, however, \"all lost in the great\r\nflood of the river Wear in 1771;\" and the Duke is said to have deeply\r\nlamented this misfortune. It is not, however, very likely that he would\r\nhave carried his ducal patent with him in his flight; and had he\r\nafterwards sent for it from Drummond Castle, some of his family must\r\nhave been apprised of his existence.\r\n\r\nIt is stated, however, but only on hearsay, that thirteen years after\r\nthe year 1745, the Duke visited his forfeited Castle of Drummond,\r\ndisguised as an old beggar, and dressed up in a light coloured wig. This\r\nrumour rests chiefly upon the evidence of the Rev. Dr. Malcolm, LLD.,\r\nwho, in 1808, published a Genealogical Memoir of the ancient and noble\r\nHouse of Drummond; and who declared, on being applied to by the family\r\nof Thomas Drummond, that he had been told by Mrs. Sommers, the\r\ndaughter-in-law of Patrick Drummond, Esq., of Drummondernock, the\r\nintimate friend of the Duke of Perth, that the Duke survived the events\r\nof the battle of Culloden a long time, and years afterwards, visited his\r\nestates, and was recognised by many of his \"trusty tenants.\"[267] A\r\nsimilar report was, at the same time, very prevalent at Strathearn; and\r\nit has been positively affirmed, that a visit was received by Mr. Graeme,\r\nat Garnock, from the Duke of Perth, long after he was believed to be\r\ndead. At this time, it is indeed wholly impossible to verify, or even\r\nsatisfactorily to refute such statements; but the existence of a report\r\nin Scotland, that the Duke did not perish at sea, may be received as an\r\nundoubted fact.[268] In 1831, when the case of Thomas Drummond was first\r\nagitated, Mrs. Atkinson and Mrs. Elizabeth Peters, the supposed\r\ndaughters of James Duke of Perth, were both alive, and on their\r\nevidence much of the stability of the case depended. The claimant,\r\nThomas Drummond, who is stated to have been the eldest son of James, son\r\nof James Duke of Perth, was born in 1792, and was living in 1831 at\r\nHoughton-le-Spring, in the occupation of a pitman. Much doubt is thrown\r\nupon the whole of the case, which was not followed up, by the length of\r\ntime which elapsed before any claim was made on the part of this\r\nsupposed descendant of the Duke of Perth. The act for the restoration of\r\nthe forfeited estates was not passed, indeed, until two years after the\r\ndeath (as it is stated) of the Duke of Perth, that is, in 1784; yet one\r\nwould suppose that he would have carefully instructed his son in the\r\nproper manner to assert his rights in case of such an event. That son\r\nlived to a mature age, married and died, yet made no effort to recover\r\nwhat were said to be his just rights.[269]\r\n\r\nSuch is the statement of those who seek to establish the belief that the\r\nDuke of Perth lived to a good old age, married, had children, and left\r\nheirs to his title and estates. On the other hand, it is certain that\r\nit was generally considered certain, at the time of the insurrection,\r\nthat the Duke died on his voyage to France; and it was even alluded to\r\nby one of the counsel at the trials of Lord Kilmarnock and Lord\r\nBalmerino in August 1746, when the name of the Duke of Perth being\r\nmentioned, \"who,\" said the Speaker, \"I see by the papers, is dead.\" But\r\nit _is_ certainly _remarkable_, that neither Maxwell of Kirkconnel, nor\r\nLord Elcho, the one in his narrative which has been printed, the other\r\nin his manuscript memoir, mention the death of the Duke of Perth on the\r\nvoyage, which, as they both state, they shared with him. So important\r\nand interesting a circumstance would not, one may suppose, have occurred\r\nwithout their alluding to it. \"All the gentlemen,\" Lord Elcho relates,\r\n\"who crossed to Nantes, proceeded to Paris after their\r\ndisembarkation;\"[270] but he enters into no further particulars of their\r\ndestination. His silence, and that of Maxwell of Kirkconnel, regarding\r\nthe Duke of Perth's death, seems, if it really took place, to have been\r\ninexplicable.\r\n\r\nAll doubt, but that the story of the unfortunate Duke's death was really\r\ntrue, appears however to be set at rest by the epitaph which some\r\nfriendly or kindred hand has inscribed on a tomb in the chapel of the\r\nEnglish Nuns at Antwerp, commemorating the virtues and the fate of the\r\nDuke, and of his brother Lord John Drummond. This monumental tribute\r\nwould hardly have been inscribed without some degree of certainty that\r\nthe remains of the Duke were indeed interred there.\r\n\r\n                                 M.

It might\r\nnot appear impossible that the Duke may have taken refuge in the then\r\nwild county of Durham for a time, but that two credible historians,\r\nMaxwell of Kirkconnel, and Lord Elcho, assert positively that he sailed\r\nfor Nantes in a vessel which went by the north-west coast of Ireland;\r\nLord Elcho and Maxwell being themselves on board, seems decisive of the\r\nentire failure of the case before quoted. It seems also wholly\r\nincredible, that the Duke of Perth, whose rank was still acknowledged in\r\nFrance, and whose early education in that country must have familiarised\r\nhim with its habits, should have remained contentedly during the whole\r\nof his life, associating with persons of the lowest grade, in an obscure\r\nvillage in Durham.\r\n\r\nAt the time of the Duke of Perth's death in 1747, one brother, Lord John\r\nDrummond, was living. This brave man, whose virtues and whose fate are\r\nrecorded in the epitaph, survived his amiable and accomplished brother\r\nonly one year, and died suddenly of a fever, after serving under Marshal\r\nSaxe at the siege of Bergen-op-Zoom. His services in the insurrection of\r\n1745 were considerable; like his brother, he escaped to France after the\r\ncontest was concluded. He died unmarried; and two sisters, the Lady\r\nMary, and the Lady Henrietta Drummond, died also unmarried. The mother\r\nof James Duke of Perth long survived him, living until 1773. It is said\r\nin the case of Thomas Drummond, that she never forgave her son for what\r\nshe considered his lukewarmness in the cause of the Stuarts, and refused\r\nto have any intercourse with him after the failure of the rebellion; but\r\nthose who thus write, must have formed a very erroneous conception of\r\nthe Duke's conduct: if he might not escape such a charge, who could\r\ndeserve the praise of zeal, sincerity, and disinterestedness?\r\n\r\nThe duchess was one of the most strenuous supporters of the Stuarts, and\r\nsuffered for her loyalty to them by an imprisonment in Edinburgh Castle.\r\nShe was committed to prison on the eleventh of February, 1746, and\r\nliberated on bail on the seventeenth.\r\n\r\nOn the forfeiture of the Drummond estates she retired to Stobhall, where\r\nshe remained until her death, at the advanced age of ninety. She was\r\nconsidered a woman of great spirit, energy, and ability, and is supposed\r\nto have influenced her son in his political opinions and actions.\r\n\r\nSome idea may be formed of the painful circumstances which follow the\r\nforfeiture of estates from the following passage, extracted from the\r\nintroduction to the letters of James Earl of Perth, Chancellor of\r\nScotland in the time of James the Second, and lately printed for the\r\nCamden Society.[272]\r\n\r\n\"When a considerable portion of the Drummond estates were restored to\r\nthe heir (no poor boon, though dilapidated, lopped, and impoverished,)\r\nhe found upon them four settlements of cottages, in which the soldiery\r\nhad been located after the battle of Culloden, to keep down the\r\n_rebels_. There were thirty near Drummond Castle, another division at\r\nCullander, a third at Balibeg, and a fourth at Stobhall. Demolition\r\nmight satisfy the abhorrence of the latter three, but what could\r\nreconcile him to the outrage under his very eyes, as he looked from his\r\nchamber or castle terrace? It was intolerable, and that every trace\r\nmight be obliterated, he caused an embankment to be made, and carried a\r\nlake-like sheet of water over the very chimney tops of the military\r\ndwellings. There is now the beautiful lake, gleaming with fish, and\r\nhaunted by the wild birds of the Highlands; and we believe the deepest\r\ndiver of them all, could not observe one stone upon another of the\r\ncabins which held the ruthless military oppressors left by the Duke of\r\nCumberland a century ago.\"\r\n\r\nThe usual accounts of the Duke's movements after the battle of Culloden,\r\nstate, however, that about a month subsequent to that event, when the\r\nfugitive Charles Stuart, in the commencement of his wanderings, landed\r\nby accident upon the little isle of Errifort, on the east side of Lewis,\r\nhe saw, from the summit of a hill which he had climbed, two frigates\r\nsailing northwards. The Chevalier in vain endeavoured to persuade the\r\nboatmen who had brought him from Lewis, to go out and reconnoitre these\r\nships. His companions judged these vessels to be English; the Prince\r\nalone guessed them to be French. He was right. They were two frigates\r\nfrom Nantes, which had been sent with money, arms, and ammunition to\r\nsuccour Charles, and were now returning to France. On board one of them\r\nwas the Duke of Perth, Lord Elcho, Lord John Drummond, old Lochiel, Sir\r\nThomas Sheridan and his nephew Mr. Hay, Maxwell of Kirkconnel, and Mr.\r\nLockhart of Carnwath, and several Low-country gentlemen, who had been\r\nwandering about in these remote parts when the frigates were setting out\r\non their return,[273] and finding that the Prince was gone, and that\r\nnothing was to be done for his service, had determined to escape. On the\r\ntenth of June these frigates reached Nantes: Lord Elcho affirms that\r\n\"all arrived safe at Nantes;\" one only is said never to have gained that\r\nshore. Worn out by fatigues too severe, and, perhaps, the progress of\r\ndisease being aided by sorrow, the Duke of Perth is generally stated to\r\nhave died on ship-board on his passage. His malady is understood to have\r\nbeen consumption.\r\n\r\nAnother celebrated member of this distinguished family, Lord\r\nStrathallan, was not spared to witness the total ruin of all his hopes.\r\nHe fell at the battle of Culloden. The impression among his descendants\r\nis, that, seeing the defeat certain, he rushed into the thick of the\r\nbattle, determined to perish. In 1746 Lord Strathallan's name was\r\nincluded in the Bill of Attainder then passed; but, in 1824, one of the\r\nmost graceful acts of George the Fourth, whose sentiments of compassion\r\nfor the Stuarts and their adherents do credit to his memory, was the\r\nrestoration of the present Viscount Strathallan to the peerage by the\r\ntitle of the sixth Viscount.\r\n\r\nIt is with regret that we take leave, amid the discordant scenes of an\r\nhistorical narrative, of one whose high purposes and blameless career\r\nare the best tribute to virtue, the noblest ornament of the party which\r\nhe espoused. Modest, yet courageous; moderate, though in the ardour of\r\nyouth; devout, without bigotry; and capable of every self-sacrifice for\r\nthe good of others, on the memory of the young Duke of Perth not a\r\nshadow rests to attract the attention of the harsh to defects of\r\nintention, unjustly attributed to the leader of the Jacobite\r\ninsurrection.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[207] Genealogy of the Most Noble and Ancient House of Drummond.

E.

Aged 33.\r\n\r\n[272] Edited by W. Jerdan, Esq., M.R.S.L., 1845.\r\n\r\n[273] Maxwell, p. 166.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFLORA MACDONALD.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe character of this celebrated woman, heroic, yet gentle, was formed\r\nin the privacy of the strictest Highland seclusion. She was born in the\r\nisland of South Uist, in 1720: she was the daughter of Macdonald of\r\nMilton. The Clan of her family was that of Macdonald of Clanranald; the\r\nChief of which is called in Gaelic, Mack-ire-Allein, and in English, the\r\ncaptain of Clan Ranald. The estate of this Chief, which is held\r\nprincipally from the Crown, is situated in Moidart and Arisaig on the\r\ncontinent of Scotland, and in the islands of Uist, Benbecula, and Rum.\r\nHis vassals, capable of military service, amounted in 1745 to five\r\nhundred.[274]\r\n\r\nThe Hebrides were at that time regarded in the more civilized parts of\r\nEurope somewhat in the same light as the Arctic regions are now\r\nconsidered by the inhabitants of England, and other polished nations:\r\n\"When I was at Ferney in 1764,\" Boswell relates, \"I mentioned our design\r\n(of going to the Hebrides) to Voltaire. He looked at me as if I had\r\ntalked of going to the North Pole, and said, 'You do not insist on my\r\naccompanying you!' 'No, sir.' 'Then I am very willing you should go.'\"\r\nIn this remote, and, in the circles of London, almost unknown region,\r\nFlora Macdonald was born and educated.\r\n\r\nThe death of her father, Macdonald of Milton, when she was only a year\r\nold, made an important change in the destiny of the little Highland\r\ngirl. Her mother married again, and became the wife of Macdonald of\r\nArmadale in Skye. Flora was, therefore, removed from the island of South\r\nUist to an island which was nearer to the means of acquiring information\r\nthan her native place.\r\n\r\nIt was a popular error of the times, more especially among the English\r\nWhigs, to regard the Highlanders of every grade, as an ignorant,\r\nbarbarous race. So far as the lowest classes were concerned, this\r\nimputation might be well-founded, though certainly not so well as it has\r\nmuch longer been in the same classes in England. Previously to the reign\r\nof George the Third many of the peasantry could not read, and many could\r\nnot understand what they read in English. There were few books in\r\nGaelic, and the defect was only partially supplied by the instruction of\r\nbards and seneachies. But, among the middle and higher classes,\r\neducation was generally diffused. The excellent grammar-schools in\r\nInverness, Fortrose, and Dunkeld sent out men well-informed, excellent\r\nclassical scholars, and these from among that order which in England is\r\nthe most illiterate--the gentlemen-farmers. The Universities gave them\r\neven a greater extent of advantages. When the Hessian troops were\r\nquartered in Atholl, the commanding officers, who were accomplished\r\ngentlemen, found a ready communication in Latin at every inn. Upon the\r\nColonel of the Hessian cavalry halting at Dunkeld, he was addressed by\r\nthe innkeeper in Latin. This class of innkeepers has wholly, unhappily,\r\ndisappeared in the Highlands.[275]\r\n\r\nBut it was in the island of Skye that classical learning was the most\r\ngeneral, and there an extraordinary degree of intelligence and\r\nacquirement prevailed among the landed gentry. \"I believe,\" observes\r\nGeneral Stewart, \"it is rather unique for the gentry of a remote corner\r\nto learn Latin, merely to talk to each other; yet so it was in Skye.\"\r\nThe acquisition of this branch of learning was not, indeed, expensive.\r\nLatin was taught for two shillings and sixpence the quarter, and English\r\nand writing for one shilling. Indeed it is scarcely more now. The people\r\nseldom quitted their insular homes, except when on service; and, to the\r\nsilence of their wild secluded scenes, the romance of poetry and the\r\ncomposition of song gave a relief and a charm.\r\n\r\nThe education of Flora Macdonald received probably little aid from the\r\nclassical teacher; but her mind was formed, not among the rude and\r\nuncultured, but among those who appreciated letters; and the influence\r\nof such an advantage in elevating and strengthening the character must\r\nbe taken into account in forming a due estimation of her heroic\r\nqualities. Thus situated, Flora passed her life in obscurity, until, at\r\nthe age of twenty-four, the events which succeeded the battle of\r\nCulloden brought those energies, which had been nurtured in retirement,\r\ninto active exertion. Indeed, until about a year before she engaged in\r\nthat enterprise which has rendered her name so celebrated, she had never\r\nquitted the islands of South Uist and Skye; she had, at that time,\r\npassed about nine months in the family of Macdonald of Largoe in\r\nArgyleshire, and this was the only change of scene, or of sphere, which\r\nshe had ever witnessed.[276]\r\n\r\nHer step-father was an enemy to the cause which, from her earliest\r\nyears, her heart espoused. A company of militia had been formed to\r\nassist the British Government by Sir Alexander Macdonald, the chieftain\r\nof one division of the clan, and in this regiment Macdonald of Armadale\r\nheld a commission as captain, at the time when the Duke of Cumberland\r\nwas \"making inquisition for blood\" throughout the western Highlands. But\r\nthe prepossessions of Flora were unalienably engaged in favour of the\r\nexiled Stuarts; and they were not, perhaps, the less likely to glow from\r\nbeing necessarily suppressed. Her disposition, notwithstanding all her\r\nsubsequent display of courage, was extremely mild; and her manners\r\ncorresponded to her temper. Her complexion was fair; and her figure,\r\nthough small, well-proportioned. In more advanced life Boswell, who with\r\nDr. Johnson visited her, characterized her person and deportment as\r\n\"genteel.\" There was nothing unfeminine, either in her form or in her\r\nmanners, to detract from the charm of her great natural vivacity, or\r\ngive a tone of hardness to her strong good sense, calm judgment, and\r\npower of decision. Her voice was sweet and low; the harsher accents of\r\nthe Scottish tongue were not to be detected in her discourse; and she\r\nspoke, as Bishop Forbes relates, \"English (or rather Scots) easily, and\r\nnot at all through the Erse tone.\" In all the varied circumstances of\r\nher life, she manifested a perfect modesty and propriety of behaviour,\r\ncoupled with that noble simplicity of character which led her to regard\r\nwith surprise the tributes which were afterwards paid to her conduct,\r\nand to express her conviction that far too much value was placed upon\r\nwhat she deemed merely an act of common humanity.\r\n\r\nIn Skye, the \"Isle of Mist\" of the poet, she could hear imperfect\r\nintelligence of the wanderings of the Jacobite leaders. She was\r\nconnected by kindred with some under whose roof the Prince had taken\r\nrefuge.\r\n\r\nThe first movement which the Prince made after taking leave of Lord\r\nLovat at Gortuleg, was to repair first to Fort Augustus, and then to\r\nInvergarie near Fort Augustus. Here he took leave of those followers who\r\nhad attended him as he quitted the field of Culloden; and retained only\r\nMr. O'Sullivan, Captain O'Neil, Captain Alan Macdonald, and one Burke, a\r\nservant. It was not until he had remained a whole day at Fort Augustus\r\nthat the Prince could be persuaded that all hopes of his troops\r\nrejoining him were at an end. On Friday, the eighteenth of April, he\r\nwent to Lochnargaig, where he stayed one night with Dr. Cameron of\r\nGlenkearn; and on the following day he proceeded to Oban, which is\r\nsituated on a corner of Clanranald's estate. He was, therefore, under\r\nthe protection of a kinsman of Flora Macdonald. He pursued his journey\r\non the next day to the country of Arisaig, and rested at a small village\r\ncalled Glenbeisdale, whence he proceeded to Boradale, the place at which\r\nhe had first landed in beginning the enterprise which was now\r\nterminated.\r\n\r\nIt had been the opinion of Clanranald, one of the Prince's most faithful\r\nadherents, that he ought not to leave the mainland, but to take shelter\r\nin different small huts, which should be built for his accommodation;\r\nwhilst Clanranald should take a trip to the Isles, and look out for a\r\nvessel to convey the unfortunate wanderer into France. By the influence\r\nof Mr. O'Sullivan this counsel was overruled; and Clanranald, finding\r\nthat Charles was determined to sail for Long Island, provided an\r\neight-oared boat, which belonged to Alexander Macdonald of Boradale;\r\nand, having provided it with rowers and other requisites for the voyage,\r\nthe party set sail from Lochnanuagh for the Isle of Uist on the\r\ntwenty-fourth of April. They assumed false names: the Prince was called\r\nMr. Sinclair; Mr. O'Sullivan was old Sinclair, his father; Captain Alan\r\nMacdonald, a relation of Clanranald, became Mr. Graham.[277] Donald\r\nMacleod the pilot, and about six men, rowers, also accompanied the\r\nPrince, but did not change their names; a clergyman of the Church of\r\nRome attended the party. The design which Charles Edward had formed, was\r\nto reach the Long Island, under which name are comprehended those\r\nWestern Islands which run in a straight line from north to south, and\r\nare at a short distance from each other. From some part of the Long\r\nIsland Charles hoped to procure a vessel in which he could escape to\r\nFrance, or at any rate to Orkney, and thence to Norway or Sweden. At\r\nthis time a proclamation, offering a reward of thirty thousand pounds\r\nfor his apprehension, had been issued by the British Government.\r\n\r\nThe Prince set sail on the evening of the twenty-sixth of April,\r\nembarking at Boradale, on the very spot where he had landed, with just\r\nsufficient daylight to get clear of Loch Luagh; for, as the coast had\r\nbeen guarded by English ships ever since his arrival in Scotland, it was\r\nnot safe to go beyond the mouth of the Loch in open day. Before the\r\nvoyage was commenced, the Prince was warned by his faithful pilot that\r\nthere would be a storm that night. \"I see it coming!\" But Charles\r\nEdward, anxious to leave the main land, where parties were dispersed in\r\npursuit of him, was determined to trust his fate to the winds. The\r\nparty, therefore, entered the boat, the Prince seating himself at the\r\nfeet of the pilot. There was also another Macleod in the boat; this was\r\nMurdoch, the son of the pilot, a boy of fifteen years of age. The\r\ncharacter of this youth was of no common order. When he had heard of the\r\nbattle of Culloden, he had provided himself with a claymore, a dirk, and\r\na pistol; and had run off from school to take his chance in the field.\r\nAfter the defeat he found means to trace out the road which the Prince\r\nhad taken, and to follow him step by step; \"and this was the way,\"\r\nrelated Donald Macleod, \"that I met wi' my poor boy.\"\r\n\r\nAnother person who was in the boat, and who afterwards made a\r\nconspicuous figure in that romance of real life, was Ned Bourke, or\r\nBurke. This man had belonged to a most valuable class, the chairmen of\r\nEdinburgh, whose honesty is proverbial; their activity and civility\r\nalmost incredible to English notions. Bourke was not, as his name seemed\r\nto imply, an Irishman; but a native of North Uist. He had been a servant\r\nto Mr. Alexander Macleod, one of Charles Edward's aides-de-camp; and\r\nwas the man who had led the Prince off the field of battle, and guided\r\nhim all the way to Boradale: for Ned Bourke knew Scotland, and indeed a\r\ngreat portion of England, well, having been servant to several\r\ngentlemen. In this, his most important service, the honest man did not\r\ndisgrace his ancient and honourable calling as a chairman. \"Excellent\r\nthings\" were spoken of him to Donald Macleod, who seems to have made\r\nsome demur as to his Irish name, and to have objected to taking him on\r\nboard.\r\n\r\nThus guided, and thus guarded, Charles Edward might fear the winds and\r\nwaves; but treachery was not to be dreaded. Not far had the men rowed\r\nbefore a violent storm arose; such as even Donald had not, from his own\r\naccount, ever been \"trysted with before,\" though he had all his life\r\nbeen a seafaring man. The Prince was now as impatient to return to the\r\nland as he had been to quit it; \"for,\" he said, \"I would rather face\r\ncannons and muskets than be in such a storm as this!\" But Donald was\r\nfirm in proceeding on the voyage: \"Since we are here,\" he replied, \"we\r\nhave nothing for it, but, under God, to set out to sea directly.\" He\r\nrefused to steer for the rock, which runs three miles along the side of\r\nthe loch; observing, \"Is it not as good for us to be drowned in clear\r\nwater, as to be dashed to pieces on a rock, and drowned also?\"\r\n\r\nA solemn silence followed this decisive reply. Every one expected\r\ninstant destruction. The night was pitch-dark; and there was no light in\r\nthe boat. They dreaded being landed on some part of the island of Skye,\r\nwhere the militia were in arms to prevent the Prince's escape. But, to\r\nuse the words of the pilot, \"As God would have it,\" that danger was not\r\nencountered. By daybreak the party discovered that they were close to\r\nRushness, in the island of Benbecula, having run according to the\r\npilot's account, thirty-two leagues in eight hours. During this perilous\r\nvoyage the spirits of Charles never sank; he encouraged every one around\r\nhim, working himself at the oars: \"he was,\" says Mr. Maxwell, \"the only\r\none that seemed void of concern.\"\r\n\r\nSuch were the circumstances under which Charles Edward landed in the\r\nLong Island;--the event which brought him into communication with Flora\r\nMacdonald. She was at that time calmly engaged in the usual duties of\r\nher station; but the spirit so prevalent in the Highlands was not\r\nextinguished in the Western Islands, either by the dread of the English\r\nmilitia, or by the defeat of the Prince. All the Jacobites of that\r\nperiod, to adopt the language of President Forbes, \"how prudent soever,\r\nbecame mad; all doubtful people became Jacobites; and all bankrupts\r\nbecame heroes, and talked of nothing but hereditary right and victory.\r\nAnd what was more grievous to men of gallantry, and, if you believe me,\r\nmore mischievous to the public, all the fine ladies, if you except one\r\nor two, became passionately fond of the young adventurer, and used all\r\ntheir arts for him in the most intemperate manner.\"[278] It was not,\r\nhowever, an idle, romantic fancy, but a fixed sentiment of duty, acting\r\nupon a kindly heart, which originated the enthusiasm of Flora.\r\n\r\nWhilst the Prince was traversing the Long Island in poverty and danger,\r\na desolate wanderer wanting the common necessaries of life, but still\r\npatient and cheerful ever hoping once more to assemble his faithful\r\nHighlanders,--living at one time four days in a desert island, then\r\nputting to sea pursued by ships,--Flora Macdonald had accidentally\r\nquitted her usual residence at Armadale in Skye, for the purpose of\r\nvisiting her step-brother at Milton.\r\n\r\nDuring her abode at Milton, Captain O'Neil, who was loitering about the\r\ncountry for the purpose of gaining intelligence for Charles Edward,\r\nformed an acquaintance with this young lady, and, it is said, paid his\r\naddresses to her. More than two months had now elapsed since Charles\r\nfirst trusted his hopes to the chance of finding a vessel on the coast\r\nof the Long Island, to take him to France. During that period his\r\nfortunes had assumed a far more threatening aspect than at any previous\r\ntime. Friends had proved faithless; Murray of Broughton, whom the Prince\r\nthen still regarded as one of the \"firmest, honestest men in the world,\"\r\nhad shown to others his real motives, and the deep selfishness,\r\ncowardice, and rapacity, of his heart. In his utmost need, when the\r\nPrince was in want of food, that wretched man had, in reply to a message\r\nfrom Charles asking money, answered that he had none; having _only_\r\nsixty louis-d'ors for himself, which were not worth sending. What was\r\nperhaps of more immediate moment was, that, whilst the friends of the\r\nyoung Chevalier had diminished, the number of his foes around him had\r\nincreased. Fifteen ships of war were to be seen near the coasts of the\r\nLong Island, thus most effectually destroying all hopes of a French\r\nvessel being able to cruize near the shore. To complete his misfortunes,\r\nthe Duke of Cumberland, upon learning that his unfortunate kinsman had\r\nsheltered himself in the Western Islands, had sent Captain Caroline\r\nScott, an officer as infamous as Hawley and Lockhart, to scour the Long\r\nIsland.\r\n\r\nSuch were the circumstances of Charles towards the latter end of June\r\n1746. He was then coursing along the shores of the Long Island, until,\r\npursued by French ships, he was obliged to land, happily for himself, on\r\nthe island of Benbecula, between the North and South Uist. Providence\r\nseemed to have conducted him to that wild and bleak shore. Scarcely had\r\nhe reached it, than a storm arose, and drove his pursuers off the coast.\r\nHere the Prince and his starving companions were overjoyed to find a\r\nnumber of crabs, or, as the Scottish pilot termed them, _partans_; a\r\nboon to the famished wanderers. From a hut, about two miles from the\r\nshore, Charles removed, first to the house of Lady Clanranald; and\r\nafterwards, by the advice of Clanranald, he went to South Uist, and took\r\nup his abode near the hill of Coradale in the centre of the island, that\r\nbeing thought the most secure retreat. Here Charles remained until again\r\ndriven from this hut by the approach of Captain Scott, with a detachment\r\nof five hundred men, who advanced close to the place where he was\r\nconcealed. The unfortunate Prince then determined upon a last and\r\npainful effort to save those who had braved hitherto the severities of\r\ntheir lot for his sake. He parted with all his followers except O'Neil.\r\nDonald Macleod shed tears on bidding him farewell. Macleod was taken\r\nprisoner a few days afterwards in Benbecula, by Lieutenant Allan\r\nMacdonald, of Knock, in Slate, in the island of Skye. He was put on\r\nboard the Furnace,[279] and brought down to the cabin before General\r\nCampbell, who examined him minutely. The General asked him \"if he had\r\nbeen along with the Pretender?\" \"Yes,\" said Donald, \"I was along with\r\nthat young gentleman, and I winna deny it.\" \"Do you know,\" said the\r\nGeneral, \"what money was upon the gentleman's head? no less a sum than\r\nfour thousand pounds sterling, which would have made you and your family\r\nhappy for ever.\" \"What then,\" said Donald, \"what could I have gotten by\r\nit? I could not have enjoyed it for two days, conscience would have\r\ngotten the better of me; and although I could have got England and\r\nScotland for my Prince, I would not have allowed a hair of his head to\r\nbe hurt.\"[280]\r\n\r\nAfter this separation, the Prince, accompanied by O'Neil, again returned\r\nto traverse the mountainous districts of South Uist. He walked in the\r\ndirection of Benbecula, and about midnight entered a shealing, or hut,\r\nwhich belonged to Angus Macdonald, the brother of his future deliverer.\r\nThe interview which shortly took place between them, was not, as it may\r\nreadily be conceived, unpremeditated.[281] Repeatedly, before the\r\nmeeting, had O'Neil asked Flora whether she would like to see the\r\nPrince? She answered with emotion that she would. She had even expressed\r\nan earnest desire to see him; and had said, if she could be of any use\r\nin aiding him to escape from his enemies, she would do it.\r\n\r\nO'Neil had had various opportunities of studying the real character of\r\nFlora Macdonald. He must have had an extraordinary notion of her energy\r\nwhen he first proposed to her, whilst they met in Clanranald's house,\r\nto take the Prince with her to Skye, dressed up in woman's clothes. This\r\nproposition appeared to Flora so \"fantastical and dangerous,\" that she\r\npositively declined it. \"A Macdonald, a Macleod, a Campbell militia\r\nwere,\" she observed, \"in South Uist in quest of the Prince: a guard was\r\nposted at every ferry; every boat was seized; no person could leave Long\r\nIsland without a passport; and the channel between Uist and Skye was\r\ncovered with ships of war.\" Such was her resolution whilst she discussed\r\nthe subject with O'Neil at the house of her kinsman, Clanranald. Nor\r\ndoes that sense of the dangers of her undertaking lessen the heroism of\r\nthe enterprise. But her woman's heart, however timid it might be at\r\nClanranald's castle, was touched, when she beheld the Prince; and\r\ncompassion, from which spring the noblest resolves, inspired her to\r\nexertion.\r\n\r\nAs the Prince, attended by O'Neil, drew near to the hut belonging to\r\nAngus Macdonald, the latter quitted Charles, and went aside, with a\r\ndesign to inform himself whether the independent companies of militia\r\nwere to pass that way, or not, on the following day, as he had been\r\ninformed. Such, at least, was his pretext; but he had an appointment\r\nwith Flora Macdonald, who was awaiting him near the hut. To his\r\nquestion, she answered that \"they would not pass until the day after.\"\r\nThen O'Neil ventured to tell the young lady that he had brought a friend\r\nto see her. She inquired in some agitation \"if it was the Prince?\" He\r\nreplied that it was, and he instantly brought her into the shealing. The\r\nkind heart of Flora was afflicted at the sight. Charles was exhausted\r\nwith fatigue and misery; he had become thin and weak, and his health was\r\ngreatly affected by the hardships which he had undergone. He and O'Neil\r\nhad lost indeed the means of personal comfort; they had but two shirts\r\nwith them, and every article of wearing apparel was worn out. To a\r\nfeeble mind, the depressed state of Prince Charles's affairs, his\r\nbroken-down aspect, and the dangers which surrounded him, would have\r\ninspired reluctance to serve one so desolate. These circumstances,\r\nhowever, only softened the resistance which Flora had at first made to\r\nthe scheme suggested for his escape, and renewed her desire to aid him.\r\n\r\nAfter her first introduction, the discourse for some time turned upon\r\nhis dangerous situation; the best remedy for which was, as both the\r\nPrince and O'Neil hinted, for Flora to convey him in disguise to Skye,\r\nwhere her mother lived. This seemed the more feasible, from the\r\nsituation which her father-in-law held, and which would enable him to\r\ngive a pass for herself and her servant.\r\n\r\nThe Prince assented to the expediency of the proposal, which originated\r\nwith O'Neil, and immediately asked Flora if she would undertake to carry\r\nthe plan into effect. Flora answered with great respect and loyalty, but\r\ndeclined, saying that \"Sir Alexander Macdonald, who commanded the\r\nmilitia in Skye, was too much her friend for her to be the instrument of\r\nhis ruin.\" O'Neil endeavoured to combat this opinion, representing that\r\nSir Alexander was not then in the country, and could not therefore be\r\nimplicated: he added, that she might easily convey the Prince to her\r\nmother's, at Armadale, as she lived close by the waterside. O'Neil also\r\ntold her of the honour and immortal fame which would redound from so\r\nglorious an action; and the Prince assured her that he should always\r\nretain a deep sense of \"so conspicuous a service.\" The firmness of Flora\r\nhad resisted the arguments of O'Neil; but it was overcome by these few\r\nwords from the Prince. She consented to let O'Neil know on the following\r\nday at what time every arrangement would be made for the plan which had\r\nbeen proposed, and she left the Prince and his adherent to shelter\r\nthemselves in the mountains of Coradale.[282]\r\n\r\nOn leaving the shealing, Flora at first returned to Milton; but, having\r\nfully made up her mind to undertake the enterprise, she set out for\r\nOrmaclade, the seat of Clanranald, on Saturday the twenty-first of June.\r\nHer journey was not without perilous adventures. On passing a ford, she\r\nwas taken prisoner by one of the militia, on account of not having a\r\npassport. She inquired by whom they were commanded; and, finding that\r\nher step-father was their captain, she refused to give an answer to the\r\nquestions put to her until she saw him. She was made a prisoner for that\r\nnight; her captivity being shared by her servant Neil Mac Kechan, a\r\nclansman, who was the father of Marshal Macdonald, Duke of Tarentum. In\r\nthe morning, Hugh Macdonald of Armadale, the step-father of Flora,\r\narrived, and liberated her; granting a passport for herself, her\r\nservant, and for another woman whom she styled Betty Burke, a good\r\nspinster, whom Armadale in the innocency of his heart recommended to\r\nhis wife at Armadale, as she had much lint to spin. His letter has been\r\npreserved; and there is every reason to believe, that, when writing it,\r\nArmadale was wholly unconscious of the design of Flora.[283]\r\n\r\nThe letter of Armadale to his wife ran as follows:--\"I have sent your\r\ndaughter from this country lest she should be frightened with the troops\r\nlying here. She has got one Betty Burke, an Irish girl, who, as she\r\ntells me, is a good spinner. If her spinning pleases you, you may keep\r\nher till she spins all your lint: or, if you have any wool to spin, you\r\nmay employ her. I have sent Mac Kechan along with your daughter and\r\nBetty Burke, to take care of them. I am, your dutiful husband,\r\n\r\n                                                   \"HUGH MACDONALD.\"\r\n\"June 22nd, 1746.\"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIt was late in the afternoon of the Sunday on which Flora had obtained\r\nher passport, before she could communicate with her friends in the\r\nmountains; about four o'clock, however, they received a message telling\r\nthem that _all was well_. The Prince and his companion, therefore,\r\ndetermined immediately to join their protectress.\r\n\r\nUpon being set at liberty, Flora went immediately to Ormaclade, where\r\nshe had, in Lady Clanranald, an enthusiastic assistant. She remained at\r\nOrmaclade for several days, making arrangements for the complete\r\ndisguise of the Prince.\r\n\r\nThe Prince and O'Neil had only waited for the arrival of Flora's\r\nmessenger to set out and meet their heroic friend; but the trusty\r\nindividual who had brought them the tidings that _all was well_,\r\ninformed them that they could not pass either of the fords which\r\nseparated South Uist from Benbecula, as they were guarded by militia. In\r\nthis extremity the Prince knew not how he should ever reach the place\r\nappointed for his meeting with Flora, which was Rossinish, in Benbecula,\r\nfrom which spot she was to conduct him to Skye. An inhabitant of South\r\nUist, seeing his perplexity, offered him a boat: the proffered aid was\r\naccepted; and Charles, with O'Neil, was landed on a promontory which the\r\npilot of the boat assured the Prince was the island of Benbecula.\r\nCharles therefore dismissed the boatmen, with orders to meet him on the\r\nopposite side of the island; and began his journey. He had not gone far\r\nwhen he found himself surrounded with water, and perceived that the\r\npilot had made a mistake. Neither Charles nor his companions had ever\r\nbefore been in this part of Benbecula. They looked around them on the\r\ndesolate prospect, and perceived that they were on a peninsula,\r\nperfectly desert, and which at high-water was separated from Benbecula.\r\nAt first Charles hoped, that, when the tide was out, some passage might\r\nbe discovered; but the waves retired and no passage appeared. The Prince\r\nwas not disheartened; for his courage, never justly questioned, had\r\ngained its best allies, patience and fortitude, during the adversities\r\nof the last few months. He supported the fainting spirits of his\r\ncompanions; and, to encourage them to search for a passage, said that he\r\nknew of one, although he was in fact as ignorant as they were. At length\r\nhe discovered a passage, and the party reached a little hut, which they\r\nwere assured was in Benbecula.[284] He marched on, exhausted as he was,\r\nto Rossinish, and arrived there at midnight, but found not the deliverer\r\nthey expected; on the contrary, he learned that they were within fifty\r\nmiles of the enemy. Hungry as they were, having eaten nothing all day,\r\nthe Prince and his fainting companions were obliged to retreat four\r\nmiles. Captain O'Neil was then sent to Ormaclade, to inquire why Flora\r\nhad not been true to her appointment. She told him that she now\r\nconsidered that North Uist would be a safer place of refuge than Skye,\r\nand that she had engaged a cousin of hers to receive him there. O'Neil\r\nremained at Ormaclade, and sent a boy to inform the Prince, who was now\r\nonly at eight miles' distance, of this proposal; but that scheme was\r\nsoon abandoned, the gentleman to whom Flora referred refusing to receive\r\nthe Prince. In this dilemma, Charles was informed that his enemies had\r\nquitted Rossinish, and he therefore hastened to that place. His safe\r\narrival there was, indeed, almost miraculous. Near him was a guard of\r\nfifty men; the island was full of militia; and the secret of his being\r\nin it was known to many a poor cotter. But, in these vicissitudes of his\r\neventful and unhappy life, the Prince was thrown among a faithful and\r\nhonourable people, in whose bosoms the conviction was planted, that to\r\nbetray him would bring down a curse upon themselves and their posterity.\r\n\r\nOn arriving at Rossinish, Captain O'Neil was again dispatched to Flora\r\nto express the disappointment of Charles on not seeing her, and to beg\r\nher to join him. She promised faithfully to do so on the following day;\r\nand she kept her word. Having hired a six-oared boat to convey her to\r\nSkye, and appointed it to be at a certain part of the coast, she set out\r\nfor Rossinish: accompanied by Lady Clanranald, whose participation in\r\nthe cause was shortly afterwards punished by imprisonment;--by a Mrs.\r\nMacdonald, and by Mac Kechan, her servant. They entered a hut, where\r\nthey found this unfortunate descendant of an ill-fated race preparing\r\nhis own dinner. It consisted of the heart, liver, and kidneys of a\r\nsheep, which he was turning upon a wooden spit. The compassion of the\r\nladies was roused by this sight; but Charles, as he bade them welcome to\r\nthe humble repast, moralized on his fate. He observed, that all _kings_\r\nwould be benefited by such an ordeal as that which he had endured. His\r\nphilosophy was seasoned by the hope of attaining what he ever\r\ndesired,--the hereditary monarchy which he believed to be his\r\nbirthright. He observed, that the wretched to-day, may be happy\r\nto-morrow. At the dinner, Flora Macdonald sat on the right-hand of the\r\nPrince, and Lady Clanranald on the left.\r\n\r\nAfter the meal was ended, Charles was requested by Flora to assume the\r\nfemale apparel which Lady Clanranald had brought. It was, of course,\r\nvery homely, and consisted of a flowered linen gown, a light-coloured\r\nquilted petticoat, and a mantle of clean camlet, made after the Irish\r\nfashion, with a hood. Their dangers, as he put on his dress, did not\r\ncheck the merriment of the party; and many jokes were passed upon the\r\ncostume of Betty Burke. A small shallop was lying near the shore, and\r\nFlora proposed that they should remove near to the place whence they\r\nwere to embark, for her fears had been excited by a message which\r\narrived from Ormaclade, acquainting Lady Clanranald that a party of\r\nsoldiers, under the infamous Captain Fergusson, had arrived at her\r\nhouse, and had taken up their quarters there. Lady Clanranald hastened\r\nhome, where she managed to deceive and perplex both General Campbell,\r\nwho had lately arrived in Benbecula, and Captain Fergusson.\r\n\r\nAnd now another trial was at hand:--it was necessary for Captain O'Neil\r\nand the Prince to separate. The Irishman would fain have remained with\r\nCharles, but Flora was firm, as well as kind; her opinion on this point\r\nwas decided; and O'Neil was obliged to yield. This point was not gained\r\nwithout much difficulty, for Charles even remonstrated. O'Neil took his\r\nleave, and made his way, through a country traversed by troops, to South\r\nUist, where O'Sullivan had been left. \"I could now,\" writes Captain\r\nO'Neil in his journal, when he relates his departure from the Prince,\r\n\"only recommend him to God and his good fortune.\" This kind-hearted man\r\nwas afterwards taken prisoner by Captain Fergusson, who had him stripped\r\nand threatened not only with the rack, but also with being whipped by\r\nhis hangman, because he would not disclose where the Prince was. These\r\ncruelties were opposed, however, by a junior officer, who, coming out\r\nwith a drawn sword, threatened Fergusson with a beating, and saved\r\nO'Neil from the punishment which was to have been the requital of his\r\nfidelity.\r\n\r\nWhen all were gone, except Flora, the Prince, and Mac Kechan, the party\r\nproceeded to the sea-shore, where they arrived wet and wearied, and\r\npassed the night upon a rock. They made a fire to warm themselves, and\r\nendeavoured still to maintain hope and cheerfulness. How picturesque and\r\nsingular must have been the group, thus awaiting the moment which should\r\nperhaps only conduct them to fresh perils! As they reclined among the\r\nheath which grew on the rock, four wherries, filled with armed men,\r\ncaused the little party to extinguish their fire, and to hide themselves\r\nin the heather. The wherries, which made at first for the shore, sailed\r\nby to the southward, within a gun-shot of the spot where Charles Edward\r\nand Flora were concealed. At eight o'clock in the evening of Saturday,\r\nthe twenty-eighth of June 1746, the Prince and she set sail from\r\nBenbecula for Skye.\r\n\r\nThe evening on which they quitted the shores which had been to them such\r\nscenes of peril was clear; but, not long after they had embarked, the\r\nsea became rough, and the weather stormy. Prince Charles resolved never\r\nto despond, sang songs to prevent the spirits of the company from\r\nflagging, and talked gaily and hopefully of the future. Exhausted by her\r\nprevious exertions, Flora sank into a sleep; and Charles carefully\r\nwatched her slumbers, being afraid lest the voices of the boatmen should\r\narouse her, or, in the dark, that any of the men should step upon her.\r\nShe awoke in a surprise at some little bustle in the boat, and asked\r\nhastily \"What was the matter?\" What must have been her emotions at that\r\nmoment!\r\n\r\nThe next day, Sunday, was one of anxiety. The boatmen had lost their\r\ntrack, and had no compass; the wind had changed, it was then calm. They\r\nmade, however, towards Waternish, in the west of Skye; but they found\r\nthe place possessed by militia, and three boats were visible near the\r\nshore. A man on board one of the boats fired at them; on which they made\r\naway as fast as they could; for, in addition to that danger, several\r\nships of war were now in sight. The Prince and his friends took shelter,\r\ntherefore, in a cleft of a rock on the shore, and there remained to rest\r\nthe men, who had been up all night, and to prepare their provisions for\r\ndinner. The party then resumed their voyage: fortunately it was calm,\r\nfor otherwise, in any distress of weather, they must have been overtaken\r\nand have perished, for an alarm had already been given of the appearance\r\nof a strange boat, and the militia were upon the watch; the promised\r\nreward set upon Charles having excited all the vigilance of his enemies.\r\nAt length, after rowing some time, they landed at Kilbride in\r\nTroternish, in Skye, about twelve miles to the north of Waternish. But\r\nseveral parties of militia were in the neighbourhood. Flora now quitted\r\nthe boat, and went with Neil Mac Kechan to Mugstat, the residence of Sir\r\nAlexander Macdonald: here she desired one of the servants to apprise\r\nLady Macdonald of her arrival. The lady was not unprepared to receive\r\nher, for a kinswoman had gone a short time before to tell her of the\r\nenterprise in which Flora had engaged.\r\n\r\nLady Margaret was well disposed to give the cause every assistance in\r\nher power. She was the daughter of the celebrated Susanna, Countess of\r\nEglintoune, and of Alexander, ninth Earl of Eglintoune, who was\r\nsupposed, while ostensibly supporting the family on the throne, to be a\r\nsecret friend of the Stuarts.[285] Lady Margaret was one of seven\r\nsisters, famed for their loveliness, and for the \"Eglintoune air,\" a\r\nterm applied to that family as a tribute to the lofty grace of their\r\ndeportment. \"It was a goodly sight,\" observes Mr. Chambers, \"a century\r\nago, to see the long processions of sedans containing Lady Eglintoune\r\nand her daughters devolve from the Close,[286] and proceed to the\r\nAssembly Rooms in the West Bow, where there was usually a considerable\r\ncrowd of plebeian admirers congregated, to behold their lofty and\r\ngraceful figures step from the chairs on the pavement.\" Lady Margaret\r\nwas greatly beloved in Skye. When she rode through the island, the\r\npeople ran before her, and took the stones off the road, lest her horse\r\nshould stumble. Her husband was also very popular. Such was the\r\nhospitality of Mugstat, that every week a hogshead of claret was drunk\r\nat his table.[287]\r\n\r\nLady Margaret had now been married six years to Sir Alexander Macdonald\r\nof Macdonald. She was the mother of three sons, two of whom were\r\neminently distinguished. The first, Sir James Macdonald, was a young man\r\nof singular accomplishments, and the friend of Lord Lyttleton; he was\r\nendowed \"with great talents for business, great propriety of behaviour,\r\ngreat politeness of manners.\" To these acquirements he added those\r\namiable qualities, which, united to great erudition, procured him the\r\ntitle of the \"Marcellus of the Western Isles.\" His early death was\r\nregarded as a general calamity; his tomb was honoured by an inscription\r\ncomposed by Lyttleton. When Dr. Johnson visited the isle of Skye, this\r\nyoung man, who died at Rome in the twenty-fifth year of his age, was\r\nstill mentioned with tears. His brother, Sir Alexander, the English-bred\r\nchieftain, but ill-supplied his loss. He was no Highlander. \"Were I in\r\nyour place, sir,\" said Johnson to the young chieftain, \"in seven years I\r\nwould make this an independent island. I would roast oxen whole, and\r\nhang out a flag as a signal to the Macdonalds to come and get beef and\r\nwhiskey.\" Sir Alexander, of whom Johnson had heard heavy complaints of\r\nrents racked, and the islanders driven to emigration, bore with\r\npoliteness the rough assaults of the Doctor: he nevertheless started\r\ndifficulties. \"Nay, sir,\" rejoined Johnson, \"if you are born to object,\r\nI have done with you, sir. I would have a magazine of arms.\" \"They would\r\nrust,\" was the meek reply. \"Let there be men to clean them,\" cried the\r\nDoctor, \"your ancestors did not use to let their arms rust!\" Such was\r\nLady Margaret's second son. The third, and youngest son of Lady\r\nMargaret, revived, however, all the fondly remembered virtues of Sir\r\nJames. Some persons may still recall the benignant appearance of the\r\nlate venerable Sir Archibald Macdonald, Lord Chief Baron of the Court of\r\nExchequer in England: there are many who must recollect his virtues and\r\nacquirements with respect.\r\n\r\nThe character of Lady Margaret was not that of her second son; but of a\r\nspirited generous woman. She was not one who would allow the arms of\r\nher ancestors \"to rust.\" Before the Prince's arrival, her energies had\r\nbeen employed in contriving the fittest route for him to take after\r\nleaving Mugstat, for she was as enthusiastic an adherent of Charles\r\nEdward as any of her female relations. Whilst he was in North Uist, he\r\nhad sent Lady Margaret a letter, enclosed, by Hugh Macdonald of\r\nBalishair, to his brother Donald Roy Macdonald, with orders to deliver\r\nit to Lady Margaret alone; and, in case of attack while at sea, to sink\r\nit, by tying it to a stone. This letter revealed the secret of the\r\nPrince's intention to quit the Long Island: it informed Lady Margaret\r\nthat Charles wanted almost all necessary habiliments; and desired that\r\nsome shirts and blankets might be provided for him; the Prince having\r\nhitherto slept only in his plaid, a custom which he retained almost\r\nconstantly during his wanderings. Balishair's letter had also unfolded a\r\nplan at that time in contemplation, that Charles should take refuge on\r\nthe small grass-island called Fladdanuach, belonging to Sir Alexander\r\nMacdonald, and having only one tenant upon it. Thither Lady Margaret was\r\nto send Donald Roy Macdonald with the articles to be in readiness for\r\nthe Prince.\r\n\r\nLady Margaret had instantly complied with these injunctions. Eventually\r\nthe notion of making Fladdanuach the retreat of Charles was given up;\r\nbut the zealous Lady Margaret had made the most careful preparations for\r\nthat scheme, and it was not from any negligence on her part that it was\r\nabandoned. The packet sent by Balishair contained, however, another\r\nvaluable paper. This was a letter written in Prince Charles's own hand,\r\nchiefly one of compliment, and full of gratitude to Lady Margaret for\r\nsending him newspapers, which had been delivered to him through\r\nMacdonald of Balishair.\r\n\r\nThis precious letter had, some time before Flora had arrived at Mugstat,\r\nbeen delivered to Lady Margaret. When she received it, she rose from her\r\nseat, and kissing it said, alluding to a precaution which had been\r\nrecommended, \"I will never burn it; I will preserve it for the sake of\r\nhim who wrote it to me. Although King George's forces should come to the\r\nhouse, I shall find means to secure it.\" Afterwards, however, her house\r\nbeing searched by the dreaded Fergusson, she considered it necessary for\r\nCharles's safety to burn it; although, as it proved, there was no search\r\nwhatsoever for papers.\r\n\r\nLady Margaret had been aided in her efforts and plans by a zealous\r\nkinsman, Captain Roy Macdonald, who had been wounded at the battle of\r\nCulloden. This person was still under medical care, and was living in\r\nthe house of a surgeon named Maclean, at Troternish. When Charles landed\r\nat Skye, Roy Macdonald, wounded as he was, had sailed to Fladdanuach, at\r\nLady Margaret's bidding, with clothes and money, and had returned just\r\nin time to witness her perplexity at the Prince's unexpected arrival.\r\n\r\nUpon that event being made known by Flora Macdonald to Lady Margaret,\r\nshe sent a message to Captain Roy Macdonald, entreating him to come to\r\nher immediately. He complied, and found Lady Margaret walking in the\r\ngarden of Mugstat, talking very earnestly to Alexander Macdonald of\r\nKingsburgh, a gentleman of the neighbourhood, who acted as factor, or\r\nchamberlain, to Sir Alexander. As Roy Macdonald approached, Lady\r\nMargaret exclaimed, holding up her hands, \"Oh, Donald Roy, we are ruined\r\nfor ever!\" It was then imparted to him that the Prince was within a\r\nquarter of a mile from Mugstat, in woman's clothes; that Lieutenant\r\nMacleod, who was employed to guard that part of Skye, and three or four\r\nof his militia-men, were about the house; a number of others being not\r\nfar distant: what was still more alarming, Flora Macdonald and the\r\nLieutenant were at that time conversing together in the dining-room.\r\n\r\nA consultation immediately ensued as to the plan the most proper to\r\nensure Charles Edward's safety. Donald Roy Macdonald declared, that,\r\nwhatever they should agree upon, \"He would undertake (God willing) to\r\naccomplish at the risk of his life.\" Kingsburgh was first called upon to\r\ngive his opinion. He proposed that the Prince should sail by the point\r\nof Troternish to Raasay, because it would be impossible for him to\r\nremain in Skye with safety. This plan was, however, opposed by Lady\r\nMargaret, who said, that, if the Prince was to sail for Raasay, it were\r\nbetter that he should remain at Mugstat all night. In short, no scheme\r\nappeared practicable; and the consultation was frequently broken off in\r\ndespair, and renewed only to start fresh difficulties. At last Donald\r\nRoy said, \"What do you think, Kingsburgh, if the Prince should run the\r\nrisk of making his way over to Portree by land?\" Kingsburgh,\r\nnotwithstanding that he was full of apprehension, thought that the plan\r\nmight be tried, although the distance from Mugstat to Portree was\r\nfourteen long Highland miles. At first it was decided that Donald Roy\r\nshould be the bearer of this scheme to the Prince; but it was afterwards\r\nargued, that, since the Prince must make \"a monstrous figure\" in woman's\r\nclothes, there might be some suspicion excited by Donald Roy's talking\r\nto so singular a stranger. It was therefore determined that no one\r\nexcept Flora Macdonald should be entrusted with the perilous task of\r\ntaking messages to Charles at his station on the shore. Lady Margaret in\r\nthe course of this conversation expressed \"that she was in great\r\ndifficulties.\" It was impossible that she could apply to any of the Clan\r\nfor assistance. The general belief was, that Sir Alexander Macdonald was\r\nunfriendly to the Prince, and that no greater favour could be shown by\r\nthe chief than seizing the royal fugitive. This increased the danger of\r\nCharles's remaining in Skye, and threw her entirely upon the good\r\noffices of Kingsburgh and Roy Donald.\r\n\r\nDuring this conference Flora Macdonald was keeping up what she\r\nafterwards described to Bishop Forbes as \"a close chit-chat\" with\r\nLieutenant Macleod, who put to her questions which she answered as \"she\r\nthought fit.\" Lady Margaret, meantime, could not forbear going in and\r\nout in great anxiety; a circumstance which Flora observed, and which\r\ncould not but add to her embarrassment; nevertheless, this extraordinary\r\nyoung woman maintained the utmost composure. She even dined in company\r\nwith the Lieutenant without betraying her perplexity in a single\r\ninstance: never was the value of that admirable quality, presence of\r\nmind, more forcibly seen than in this instance. It had been the office\r\nof the Lieutenant to examine every boat that had landed, and to\r\ninvestigate into the motives and destination of every passenger. How the\r\nboat which had conveyed the Prince to Skye escaped search has not been\r\nexplained. At all events, Flora completely baffled every inquiry; and\r\nperhaps no one could do so better than a Scottish woman. The ordinary\r\ncaution in reply, observable in Highland females, is very striking. The\r\nPrince was awaiting his fate all this time upon the rock at the shore,\r\nnot above a gun-shot from the foot of the garden. The faithful and\r\nanxious servant Mac Kechan went to him repeatedly, but without\r\nmolestation; and Macdonald of Kingsburgh, who could not controul his\r\nanxiety to see Charles Edward, providing himself with a bottle of wine\r\nand some bread, also repaired to him. The Prince was then sitting upon\r\nthe shore, having startled a flock of sheep, the running of which first\r\nattracted Kingsburgh to the place where he was planted.\r\n\r\nCharles had removed to a more distant spot than that which he had at\r\nfirst selected, for he had been apprised by Neil Mac Kechan of\r\nKingsburgh's intended visit, and conducted by that faithful servant to\r\nthe back of a certain hill, where he was requested to wait until\r\nKingsburgh should reach him. It was also announced to Charles by Neil,\r\nthat he was to go to Portree, resting by the way at the house of\r\nKingsburgh, who was a staunch Jacobite.\r\n\r\nWhen Kingsburgh drew near to the place where Charles awaited him, he saw\r\nthe Prince approaching him with a short thick cudgel (not a very\r\nfeminine appendage) in his hand. \"Are you,\" cried Charles, \"Mr.\r\nMacdonald of Kingsburgh?\" \"Yes, sir,\" replied Kingsburgh. \"Then,\" said\r\nCharles, \"all is well; come let us be going.\" Macdonald, however, first\r\nbegged the Prince to partake of some refreshment, which he did; the top\r\nof a rock serving for a table. This being done, they proceeded on their\r\njourney; Kingsburgh telling his fellow-traveller with no less admiration\r\nthan joy, \"that he could recollect no cause either of business or duty\r\nfor his being at Mugstat that day.\" \"I'll tell you the cause,\" said the\r\nPrince; \"Providence sent you hither to take care of me.\"\r\n\r\nThey were now interrupted by some country-people coming from the kirk.\r\nThese sociable rustics were disposed to favour the Prince and his\r\ncompanion with their conversation. Kingsburgh could think of no other\r\nway of getting rid of them than saying, \"Eh, sirs! cannot ye let alone\r\ntalking o' your worldly affairs on the sabbath? and have patience till\r\nanother day?\" The poor people took the pious hint and moved off.[288]\r\n\r\nFor some time after the Prince had set out, Flora remained at Mugstat,\r\nwhere Lady Margaret, who could only speak to her in presence of the\r\nofficer, pressed her much to stay, and feigned a great anxiety to retain\r\nher for a few days, telling her that she had promised to do so the first\r\ntime that she came that way. But Flora excused herself, saying that she\r\nwanted to be at home in these troublesome times, and also to see her\r\nmother. She was at length suffered to depart, accompanied by Mrs.\r\nMacdonald of Kirkibost, the lady who had apprised Lady Margaret of her\r\nvisit, but who was not in the secret of the Prince's disguise. This\r\nlady's maid and man servant, and Mac Kechan completed the party. Lady\r\nMargaret during the whole of this agitating affair never saw the Prince\r\n\"in any shape.\"[289]\r\n\r\nFlora and her companions soon overtook the Prince and Kingsburgh. They\r\nfound the curiosity of her companion somewhat inconvenient, for Mrs.\r\nMacdonald was very anxious to see the \"strange woman's\" face; but it was\r\nalways turned away from her inquisitive gaze. Yet Mrs. Macdonald made\r\nher observations nevertheless. \"She never,\" she said, \"had seen before\r\nsuch an impudent-looking woman--and she must either be an Irish woman,\r\nor a man in woman's clothes!\" Flora, who had the happy and rare art of\r\nnot saying too much, replied that \"she was an Irishwoman, for she had\r\nseen her before.\" The maid who attended Mrs. Macdonald took notice of\r\nthe supposed Irish woman's awkward way of managing her petticoats, and\r\nremarked what long strides she took in walking. In particular, in wading\r\na rivulet, the Prince lifted up his troublesome garments so high, that\r\nMac Kechan called out to him \"for God's sake to take care, or he would\r\ndiscover himself.\" Charles laughed heartily, and thanked him for his\r\ncautions: he much feared that they would be neglected. Flora began to be\r\napprehensive of the loquacious and observant mistress and maid. She, as\r\nwell as Mrs. Macdonald, was now on horseback, and she proposed that the\r\nladies should go on a little faster, and leave those on foot to take\r\ntheir time. There was another object in this arrangement: the country\r\nwas traversed by parties of militia, and it was necessary for the Prince\r\nand Kingsburgh to diverge by a cross-road over the hills to the place of\r\ntheir destination. They went therefore by by-paths, south-south-east, to\r\nKingsburgh's house, which they reached at midnight; Flora having arrived\r\nthere a short time before. She had parted with her other companions on\r\nthe road.\r\n\r\nDuring this journey of seven long miles, which were performed in a\r\ndrenching rain, there was no slight risk, owing to the very singular\r\ndemeanour of the Prince, and to the awkwardness with which he performed\r\nhis part. Betty Burke was regarded by the gazing passers-by as a very\r\nstrange woman. When the country-people greeted him with an obeisance, he\r\nreturned it with a bow instead of a curtsey; and in all his gestures he\r\nforgot the woman, and retained the man. After the remonstrance upon\r\nholding his skirts too high, he let them fall down into the streams\r\nwhich often intersected his path. \"Your enemies, sir,\" remarked\r\nKingsburgh, \"call you a Pretender, but you are the worst at your trade\r\nthat I ever saw.\" \"Why,\" replied Charles laughing, \"they do me perhaps\r\nas much injustice in this as in other respects. I have all my life\r\ndespised assumed characters, and am the worst dissembler in the world.\"\r\n\r\nLady Kingsburgh, not expecting her husband that night, had retired to\r\nrest; and her house was not at this time in the best possible condition\r\nfor receiving visitors. Kingsburgh, however, introduced Charles into the\r\nhall, and sent a servant up-stairs to desire Lady Kingsburgh to rise and\r\ndress herself. But the lady was not disposed to comply with her\r\nhusband's commands that night. She sent a message to beg that he and\r\nhis guests would help themselves to whatsoever they found in the house,\r\nand excuse her absence. As soon as she had despatched this answer, her\r\ndaughter, a child of seven years of age, ran into the room, and told\r\nher, with much astonishment, that her father had brought home the most\r\nodd \"_ill-shaken-up wife_\" that she had ever seen, and had conducted her\r\ninto the hall. Kingsburgh now made his appearance, and entreated his\r\nwife to come down-stairs, her presence being absolutely requisite.[290]\r\nLady Kingsburgh was now really aroused. She could not help suspecting\r\nthat her husband had taken into his house some of those proscribed and\r\nwretched fugitives who were skulking about the country. She could well\r\nimagine the distress of many of the Jacobites, for a paper had been, for\r\nsome weeks, read in the kirks, forbidding all persons to give any sort\r\nof sustenance to a rebel, under pain of being deprived of it\r\nthemselves.[291]\r\n\r\nShe now dressed herself, sending her little girl into the hall to fetch\r\nher keys. The child went down-stairs, but returned, saying that she\r\ncould not go into the hall, the \"strange woman\" was walking backwards\r\nand forwards in so frightful a manner. Lady Kingsburgh therefore went\r\nherself, but stopped short at the door on seeing the stranger, whose\r\naspect seems to have been unusually gaunt and unwomanly. Her husband,\r\nhowever, bade her go in for her keys, and at last she found courage to\r\nenter.\r\n\r\nAs she walked into the hall, Charles arose from his seat and advanced\r\nto meet her. According to the custom of the day, which applied both to\r\nladies and gentlemen, he offered her the compliment of a salute. Lady\r\nKingsburgh felt the roughness of no woman's cheek against her own.\r\nAlarmed at the discovery, she nearly fainted; she spoke not, neither did\r\nthe stranger. She went hastily towards Kingsburgh, and told him her\r\nsuspicions. No reproaches were uttered on her part for the introduction,\r\nwhich had evidently some risk connected with it; she merely asked, \"Does\r\nthis strange woman know anything about the Prince?\" Her husband, taking\r\nher hand, replied, \"My dear, this is the Prince himself.\" \"The Prince!\"\r\nreturned Lady Kingsburgh; \"then we shall all be hanged!\" \"We can die but\r\nonce,\" answered Kingsburgh; \"could we die in a better cause? We are only\r\ndoing an act of humanity.\"\r\n\r\nHe then desired her to send in supper. \"Let us have eggs, butter,\r\ncheese, or whatever can be procured in the shortest time.\" The lady\r\nremonstrated. \"Eggs, butter, and cheese for a Prince!\" \"he will never\r\nlook at such a supper.\" \"Ah, my dear,\" returned Kingsburgh, \"you little\r\nknow how this poor Prince has fared of late. Our supper will be a\r\nbanquet to him. Besides, any formal preparation would excite suspicion.\r\nMake haste, and come to supper yourself.\" Lady Kingsburgh had now a new\r\nsource of alarm. \"_I_ come to supper!\" she cried; \"I do not know how to\r\nbehave before a Prince.\" She was reassured by her husband, who told her\r\nthat there was no difficulty in behaving before _this_ Prince, who was\r\nso easy and obliging.\r\n\r\nThe party, who had undergone such a day's journey, sat up nearly till\r\ndawn, and became merry over their supper. Never was there a more joyous\r\nor inspiring guest at a feast than the unfortunate Charles. He was now\r\nin the house of a trusted adherent; and his spirits, which had been\r\nunaltered even in huts and caverns, gladdened all present. His favourite\r\ntoast, was \"To the Black Eye!\" by which, as his pilot to the Long\r\nIsland, Donald Macleod, relates, he meant the second daughter of France;\r\n\"and I never heard him,\" said Donald, \"name any particular health but\r\nthat alone. When he spoke of that lady, which he did frequently, he\r\nappeared to be more than ordinarily well-pleased.\"[292]\r\n\r\nThe Prince ate heartily, and drank a bumper of brandy to the health of\r\nhis host and hostess. When the ladies had retired, he took out a little\r\nblack piece of tobacco-pipe which had been his consolation in all his\r\nwanderings, and began to smoke. Like most persons who have recourse to a\r\nsimilar practice, Prince Charles framed an excuse for it on the plea of\r\nhealth, telling Kingsburgh, that he had found it essential, in order to\r\ncure the tooth-ache, from which he had suffered much. His pipe had\r\nobtained the name, among his companions, of the \"_cutty_\".\r\n\r\nA small china punch-bowl was then produced by the host, and was twice\r\nreplenished with the very popular beverage called toddy, of which the\r\nPrince expressed his unqualified approbation. Conversation, thus aided\r\nand exhilarated, flowed freely; and the charm of Charles's gay courtesy\r\nwas long remembered by his Highland landlord, who thus, at the risk of\r\nall that was dear to him, welcomed the unfortunate wanderer to his home.\r\nMorning dawned before either the Prince or Kingsburgh talked of\r\nretiring. At last Kingsburgh became anxious. He knew that it was\r\nnecessary for Charles to proceed to Portree early the next day; and he\r\nearnestly desired that the Prince should have some rest. He refused to\r\nfill the bowl again, and began to urge his Highness to retire. Charles\r\neagerly pressed for another supply of usquebaugh and warm water. In the\r\ncontention, the bowl, which Kingsburgh had brought from Mugstat for the\r\nPrince to drink the wine out of on the shore, was broken. This ended the\r\naltercation, and Charles retired to rest.\r\n\r\nThe next day was far advanced before the Prince, after his conviviality\r\nof the preceding evening, was aroused; and the watchful Flora in vain\r\nsent Kingsburgh into his chamber to persuade him to rise. Kingsburgh had\r\nnot the heart to awaken the fugitive from a repose which he so rarely\r\nenjoyed, and, on finding him in a profound sleep, retired. At last, one\r\no'clock had struck, and the Prince was summoned to begin another\r\njourney. Kingsburgh, inquiring if he had had a good night, was answered\r\nthat he had never enjoyed a better one in his life. \"I had almost\r\nforgotten,\" said Charles, \"what a good bed was.\" He then prepared to set\r\nout. He was first to go to Portree; his destination being, ultimately,\r\nthe island of Raasay. The choice of this place as a retreat originated\r\nin the ancient league which subsisted between the families of Macdonald\r\nand of Raasay. Whenever the head of either family died, his sword was\r\ngiven to the head of the other. The chief of Raasay had joined the\r\nHighland army, but had saved his estate by conveying it to his son,\r\nyoung Macleod. Sir Alexander Macdonald, on that occasion, had thus\r\naddressed his neighbour and ally: \"Don't be afraid, Raasay; I'll use my\r\ninterest to keep you safe; and, if your estate should be taken, I'll buy\r\nit for the family. And he would have done it.\"[293]\r\n\r\nOn quitting Kingsburgh, the Prince was determined to cast off his\r\ndisguise. Kingsburgh was favourable to the change, but Flora would not\r\nconsent to it: it was necessary, she thought, that the wanderer should\r\nleave the house in the same dress as he had entered it; so that, if\r\ninquiry were made, the servants would not be able to describe his\r\nappearance. He, therefore, once more figured in the habiliments of Betty\r\nBurke; and the only change, which was at the suggestion of Kingsburgh,\r\nwas in the article of shoes; those in which he had walked being now worn\r\nout; a new pair was therefore supplied by Kingsburgh. When the exchange\r\nwas made, Kingsburgh hung up the old shoes in a corner of his room,\r\nobserving, that they might still do him some service. Charles inquired,\r\n\"How?\" \"Why,\" replied Kingsburgh, \"when you are at St. James's, I shall\r\nhold up these shoes before you, and thus remind you of your night's\r\nentertainment and protection under my roof.\" Charles, with a smile,\r\ndesired him to be as \"good as his word.\" These precious deposits, never\r\nbeing required to appear at St. James's, were, after old Kingsburgh's\r\ndeath, cut into pieces, and kept as relics by the Jacobite ladies, and\r\neven by the grave but enthusiastic Bishop Forbes.[294]\r\n\r\nIt had been decided that Flora Macdonald should proceed on horseback to\r\nPortree by a different road, and should meet the Prince there. She\r\ntherefore took a temporary leave of Charles; and Kingsburgh accompanied\r\nhim to a wood not far from his house. When the Prince had departed, Lady\r\nKingsburgh went up-stairs, and folded up the sheets in which he had\r\nslept, declaring that they should never be washed nor used till her\r\ndeath, when they should be made into her winding-sheet. She was\r\nafterwards induced to divide this valuable memorial with Flora\r\nMacdonald.\r\n\r\nMac Kechan, and a little herd-boy by way of a guide, alone accompanied\r\nthe Prince, as he set out upon a laborious walk of fourteen miles\r\ntowards Portree. It would have excited much suspicion, had any more\r\nimportant persons attended him. At an appointed place Charles threw off\r\nhis female attire, and again \"grasped the claymore.\" His clothes were\r\nconcealed in a bush until they could be carried to Kingsburgh's house,\r\nwhere they were burnt upon the alarm of a search on the part of the\r\nmilitary. The gown only was retained, by the express desire of\r\nKingsburgh's daughter.[295] The Prince now once more wore the Highland\r\ndress, which had been furnished him by Kingsburgh.\r\n\r\nMeantime, Captain Roy Macdonald had gone to seek the young Macleod of\r\nRaasay, or, as he was called, Rona, whose very brother-in-law,\r\nArchibald Macqueen, was then in search for the Prince in South Uist.\r\nYoung Macleod, though at first indisposed to confide the place where his\r\nfather had taken refuge to Roy Macdonald, ended eventually by\r\nexpressing, both on his own part and on that of his father, the\r\nstrongest desire to serve the Prince, especially in his distress.\r\n\"Then,\" said Roy Macdonald, \"I expect the Prince this night at Portree;\r\nand as there is no boat on this side fit to carry him over to Raasay,\r\nyou must do your best, Rona, to get one for the purpose to ferry the\r\nPrince over to Raasay, for thither he means to set out from Portree.\"\r\nRona undertook this service, but was unwilling to leave Portree until he\r\nshould see the Prince; for he had not been \"out\" in the last campaign.\r\nBut, being repeatedly urged by Roy Macdonald, he at last embarked in a\r\ncrazy old boat which filled perpetually with water, and could only with\r\nassistance be made to convey passengers from Portree to Raasay, a\r\ndistance nearly of five miles. Before young Raasay embarked, Roy\r\nMacdonald had received a note from Kingsburgh, importing that Flora\r\nMacdonald was so fatigued that she could not go to Portree so soon as\r\nshe had intended; and ordering the captain to provide a boat to ferry\r\nher about to Strath, because it would be easier to her \"to make it out\"\r\nby sea than overland. Captain Roy Macdonald took the hint, and judged\r\nexactly for whom the boat thus carefully alluded to was to be provided.\r\nOn Monday the thirtieth of June, young Raasay, and his brothers Murdoch\r\nMacleod and Malcolm Macleod, arrived after a short, but perilous voyage\r\nwithin a mile of Portree. Malcolm went to the shore, leaving Rona in\r\nthe boat. As he walked from the beach, he saw three persons approaching.\r\nIt is said, that at Raasay nine months of the year are rainy. This June\r\nevening was one of the rainy periods; and Malcolm Macleod could not,\r\nthrough the darkness, discover who these three persons were. The place\r\nof meeting agreed upon was a small public-house near the shore, about\r\nhalf a mile from the port of Portree; to this house Malcolm Macleod sent\r\nto Captain Roy Macdonald, desiring him to come out and speak to a\r\nfriend. Roy Macdonald complied with the summons, taking with him a half\r\nmutchkin stoup full of whiskey. Macleod then informed him that Rona and\r\nhis brother Murdoch were on the shore with a boat, which, with much\r\ndifficulty and danger they had brought from Raasay to convey the Prince\r\nto that island; he begged that they would not delay, as it was raining\r\nvery heavily.\r\n\r\nDonald Roy Macdonald then told Malcolm that the three persons whom he\r\nhad seen going towards the public-house were the Prince, Mac Kechan, and\r\nthe herd-boy. Of their approach he had been apprized by the energetic\r\nFlora, who had arrived at Portree some hours previously.\r\n\r\nDonald Roy Macdonald, who is described as being the model of \"a perfect\r\nHighland gentleman,\" shared the enthusiasm of Flora. Although still lame\r\nfrom the wound in his foot, he had, during the course of that evening,\r\nlooked out incessantly for the Prince, but was unable to see him. He had\r\nnot, however, been long in the public-house, before the voice of the\r\nherd-boy calling for the landlord, and desiring to know if one Donald\r\nRoy Macdonald were there, drew his attention. He stepped out, and was\r\ntold by the boy that there was a gentleman, a little above the house,\r\nwho desired to speak to him. The captain sent the boy away, and\r\nimmediately went to the spot where the Prince stood. Charles embraced\r\nhim, putting his head first over one shoulder, and then over the other;\r\nand telling Donald to use no ceremony, for that it was impossible to\r\nknow who might be observing them. When Donald expressed his regret at\r\nthe darkness of the night, Charles said, \"I am more sorry that _our\r\nlady_\" (so he called Flora Macdonald) \"should be so abused with the\r\nrain.\"\r\n\r\nAfter they entered the house, a curious scene took place. \"The Prince,\"\r\nrelates Donald Roy,[296] \"no sooner entered the house than he asked if a\r\ndram could be got there, the rain pouring down from his clothes; he\r\nhaving on plaid, without breeches, trews, or even philibeg. Before he\r\nsat down, he got his dram; and then the company desired him to shift,\r\nand put on a dry shirt, Captain Roy Macdonald giving him his philibeg.\r\nThe Prince refused to shift, as Miss Flora Macdonald was in the room;\r\nbut the captain and Neil Mac Kechan told him, it was not time to stand\r\nupon ceremonies, and prevailed upon him to put on a dry shirt. By this\r\ntime they had brought some meat into the room, (the Prince having called\r\nfor it before he would think of shifting,) which consisted of butter,\r\ncheese, bread, and roasted fish.\"\r\n\r\nThe Prince was so hungry and exhausted, after a walk from Kingsburgh to\r\nPortree, \"seven good Highland miles,\" that he began to eat before he\r\nput on his coat. The supply of food which he had brought with him\r\nconsisted of a cold hen, a bottle of brandy, and a lump of sugar in one\r\nof his pockets: these, with the addition of a bottle of whiskey procured\r\nat Portree, constituted his store of provisions until he reached Raasay.\r\nOn seeing the Prince eat heartily, whilst only in his shirt and\r\nphilibeg, Captain Donald Macdonald could not forbear smiling. \"Sir,\" he\r\nobserved, \"I believe that is the English fashion,\" \"What fashion do you\r\nmean?\" asked the Prince. \"They say,\" replied Donald, \"that the English,\r\nwhen they eat heartily, throw off their clothes.\" \"They are right,\"\r\nanswered Charles, \"lest anything should incommode their hands when they\r\nare at work.\" The Prince then asked, if any drink could be had. He was\r\ntold that he could have nothing but whiskey or water, for no such thing\r\nas beer or ale was to be had in the isle of Skye. Then Charles asked if\r\nhe could have some milk, but was informed that there was none in the\r\nhouse. The only beverage which seemed attainable was water, of which\r\nthere was a supply in what Captain Donald Macdonald called an \"ugly\r\ncog,\" which the landlord of the house used for throwing water out of his\r\nboat. This vessel though coarse, was clean. \"The captain,\" relates\r\nDonald Roy, \"had been taking a drink out of the cog, and he reached it\r\nto the Prince,[297] who took it out of his hand, and, after looking at\r\nthe cog, he stared the captain in the face, who upon this made up to him\r\n(the landlord being in the room), and whispered him softly in the ear to\r\ndrink out of it without any ceremony; for though the cog looked ill,\r\nyet it was clean; and, if he should show any nicety, it might raise a\r\nsuspicion about him in the landlord's mind. The Prince said, 'You are\r\nright,' and took a hearty draught of water out of the rough cog, and\r\nthen he put on his coat.\"\r\n\r\nDuring all this scene, Captain Roy Macdonald could scarcely disguise his\r\nanxiety that the Prince should leave Portree. But Charles was reluctant\r\nto relinquish shelter and society; the rain was still heavily pouring\r\ndown, and the night on which the unfortunate wanderer was again to trust\r\nhis fate to strangers was very dark. In vain, therefore, did Macdonald,\r\nwhen the landlord had left the room, represent to Charles, that this,\r\nbeing a public-house, was frequented by all \"sorts of folks,\" and that\r\nsome curiosity would be excited by his appearance. There was, indeed, no\r\nrest for the proscribed fugitive. Charles then asked for tobacco, that\r\nhe might smoke a pipe \"before he went off.\" Macdonald answered, that\r\nthere was no tobacco, except that which was very coarse; only \"roll\r\ntobacco.\" But Charles persisted in having it, saying \"that it would\r\nserve his horn very well.\" The landlord therefore was ordered to bring\r\nin a quarter of a pound, which he did in scales, at four-pence\r\nhalfpenny. The Prince gave a sixpence, but the landlord was desired by\r\nCaptain Macdonald to bring in the change. Charles smiled at Donald Roy's\r\nexactness, and said he would not be at the trouble to pick up the\r\nhalfpence; but Donald Roy persuaded him to do so, saying, that in his\r\nHighness's present situation he would find \"bawbees very useful to him.\"\r\n\r\nA bottle of whiskey having been dispatched between the Prince, Donald\r\nRoy Macdonald, and Neil Mac Kechan, and the pipe being finished,\r\nCharles reluctantly began to talk of his departure. He had learned to\r\nrely upon the fidelity of the brave Clan, one young and gentle daughter\r\nof which had protected him from South Uist, and brought him through a\r\ncountry swarming with militia to Portree. He was unwilling to be\r\nseparated from Donald Roy, and entreated him in a low voice to accompany\r\nhim. But Donald begged him to remember that it was not in his power to\r\nbe useful to him, considering the open wound in his left foot; that he\r\nshould only prove a burden to him, for it would be out of his power to\r\nskulk from place to place; and indeed it would be necessary for him to\r\nride on horseback, so that any of the parties of militia who were\r\nranging about would be sure to descry him at a distance, and that would\r\nbe ruin to the chance of escape. Charles then said, that \"he had always\r\nfound himself safe in the hands of a Macdonald, and that, as long as he\r\ncould have a Macdonald with him, he still should think himself safe.\"\r\nAgain and again he urged this point. It was affecting to see how\r\nconfidingly this ill-fated young man, noble in his nature, leaned upon\r\nthose whom he had learned to trust. It is melancholy to reflect that a\r\ntemper so kindly should ever have been worked up, and irritated almost\r\nto madness, by those intrigues and misrepresentations which eventually,\r\ncombining with the wreck of his other moral qualities, alienated him\r\nfrom all who really loved him.\r\n\r\n\"The Prince,\" as Donald relates, \"could not think of parting with him at\r\nall.\" This was the first time that Charles had entrusted himself,\r\nwithout a single familiar friend or attendant, to strangers. \"Are you,\"\r\nhe said, again addressing Donald, \"afraid to go with me? So long as _I_\r\nhave, you shall not want.\" Again Captain Macdonald referred to his\r\ncrippled foot: \"he behoved to see,\" he said, \"that his going would only\r\nexpose the Prince to new dangers, of which he had already too many to\r\ncontend with.\" In the course of the conversation he took occasion to\r\ntell the Prince, since he had honoured the Macdonalds with his regard,\r\nthat, although Sir Alexander Macdonald and his followers did not join\r\nhis standard, they wished him well. \"I am sensible enough of all that,\"\r\nwas the reply of Charles. Donald also inquired whether the Prince was\r\nwell provided with money; as in case of need, Lady Margaret Macdonald\r\nwould supply his wants. But Charles, after expressing his gratitude to\r\nLady Margaret, declined her aid, as he believed that he had sufficient\r\nto carry him to the mainland.\r\n\r\nThis painful and memorable scene came at last to a conclusion. After\r\nbeing repeatedly urged by Donald to depart, Charles bade Mac Kechan\r\nfarewell. He then turned to Flora Macdonald: \"I believe, madam,\" he\r\nsaid, \"that I owe you a crown of borrowed money.\" She answered, in her\r\nliteral and simple manner, \"It was only half-a-crown.\" This sum the\r\nPrince paid her. He then saluted her, and said: \"Notwithstanding all\r\nthat has happened, I hope, madam, we shall meet in St. James's yet.\" In\r\nthis calm, and, apparently laconic manner, he bade Flora adieu. But,\r\nthough fate did not permit Charles to testify his gratitude at St.\r\nJames's, he is said never to have mentioned without a deep sense of his\r\nobligations the name of his young protectress. In her loyal and simple\r\nheart a sense of duty, enthusiastic reverence, and fond regret dwelt,\r\nwhilst that heart continued to beat; and, through the vicissitudes of\r\nher after-life, the service which she had rendered to the Prince\r\nrecurred like a ray of sunshine upon a destiny almost continually\r\nclouded and darkened by calamity.\r\n\r\nFlora was left alone at Portree, attended still by Mac Kechan, who\r\nafterwards escaped, rejoined the Prince, and went to France with him.\r\nMac Kechan was a man of good education, and was conjectured by Bishop\r\nForbes to have been the author of the \"Alexis, or the Young Adventurer,\"\r\na romance embodying the principal incidents of Charles Edward's life;\r\nbut of this there is no proof.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile the Prince proceeded to the shore. He tied the bottle of\r\nwhiskey, bought of the landlord, to his belt on one side, and the\r\nbrandy, the cold hen, and the four shirts on the other. As he went, he\r\nsaw the landlord of the public-house looking out of a window after him;\r\non which he changed his road. He met young Raasay and his brothers at\r\nthe appointed place; and it was there agreed, that in a few days Donald\r\nMacdonald should follow the Prince to Raasay. At his departure the\r\nPrince took out the lump of sugar from his pocket, and said, \"Pray give\r\nthis to _our lady_, for I fear she will get no sugar where she is\r\ngoing.\" The captain refused however to accept of that which seems to\r\nhave been considered as a great delicacy. Charles then enjoined Captain\r\nMacdonald to secrecy as to his destination. \"Tell nobody--no, not _our\r\nlady_--where I am going; for it is right that my course should not be\r\nknown.\"[298] They then parted; and at daybreak, July the first, 1746,\r\nCharles sailed for Raasay. Captain Macdonald then returned to Portree,\r\nwhere he slept a great portion of the next day. Here he was closely\r\nquestioned by the landlord, who said, that he had a great notion that\r\nthe gentleman who had supped at his house was the Prince, for he had\r\nsomething noble about him. Probably the imprudent liberality of Charles,\r\nand his carelessness about money, may have added to the impression which\r\nhis lofty air and fascinating manners generally produced. On the fourth\r\nof July, Charles, after various adventures in the island of Raasay,\r\nescaped to the mountains. This event was announced by a letter sent\r\nmysteriously by Murdoch Macleod to Roy Macdonald, and delivered to him\r\nin the darkness of night. It had neither address on it, nor place, nor\r\ndate; but was written by Charles.\r\n\r\n    \"Sir,\r\n\r\n    \"I have parted as I intended. Make my compliments to all to whom I\r\n    have given trouble. I am, sir, your humble servant,\r\n\r\n                                                    \"JAMES HERMION.\"\r\n\r\nThis letter was burned by Roy Macdonald, though with great reluctance,\r\non the day when he subsequently learned that Flora Macdonald had been\r\nmade a prisoner.\r\n\r\nFlora, after parting from the Prince, went to Armadale to her mother,\r\nafter a very fatiguing journey across the country. Her emotions on\r\nseparating from Charles have been expressed in a poem entitled \"The\r\nLament of Flora Macdonald,\" beginning thus:\r\n\r\n    \"Far o'er the hills of the heather so green,\r\n      And down by the Corrie that skips in the sea,\r\n    The bonny young Flora sat weeping her love--\r\n      The dew on her plaid, and the tear in her e'e.\r\n    She looked at a boat with the breezes that swung,\r\n    And ay as it lessened she sighed and she sung,\r\n      'Farewell to the lad I shall ne'er see again!\r\n    Farewell to my hero, the gallant and young!\r\n      Farewell to the lad I shall ne'er see again,'\"[299]\r\n\r\nDuring eight or ten days Flora remained in her house at Armadale without\r\nimparting to any one, even to her mother, the events of the last week.\r\nTo make her mother a participator in that affair would indeed have been\r\nno act of kindness, at a time when the merest suspicion of being a\r\nJacobite was regarded as a crime.\r\n\r\nAt the expiration of ten days Flora received a message from a person of\r\nher own name, Donald Macdonald of Castletown, in Skye, about four miles\r\nfrom Armadale, to bid her come to his house in order to meet there the\r\ncommanding officer of an independent company, one Macleod of Taliskar,\r\nwho had ordered Macdonald to surrender. Flora, a little suspicious of\r\nwhat might happen, thought proper to consult with her friends as to what\r\nstep she should take. They unanimously agreed that she ought not to go;\r\nbut \"go she would.\" Then they consulted together what she should say in\r\ncase of an investigation. But Flora had made up her mind as to the\r\nanswers she should give. She set out to meet her fate. She probably\r\nexpected that she should be released after a short examination; for she\r\nknew not then through what channel the part which she had taken in the\r\nPrince's escape had transpired. The fact was, that the boatmen who had\r\nbrought her with Charles from Skye had on their return communicated to\r\nCaptain Fergusson every particular of the Prince's appearance, and had\r\neven described the gown which he had worn.\r\n\r\nFlora afterwards remembered, that at Mugstat Lady Margaret had warned\r\nher that this would be the case, and had pointed out to her the\r\nindiscretion of allowing these men to go back to North Uist.\r\n\r\nAs she went on the road to Castleton, Flora met her father-in-law,\r\nMacdonald of Armadale, who was returning home; and shortly afterwards\r\nshe was apprehended by Captain Macleod of Taliskar, with a party of\r\nsoldiers, who were going to seek for her at her mother's house. She was\r\nnot suffered to take leave of her mother, nor of her other friends; but\r\nwas carried on board the Furnace, a sloop of war, commanded by Captain\r\nJohn Fergusson, and which lay near Raasay. Happily for Flora, General\r\nCampbell was on board, and by his orders she was treated with the utmost\r\nrespect. At her first examination she merely acknowledged, that, on\r\nleaving Uist, she had been solicited by \"a great lusty woman\" to give\r\nher a passage, as she was a soldier's wife. Her request, Flora said, was\r\ngranted; and the woman, upon being landed in Skye, had walked away, and\r\nFlora had seen nothing more of the stranger.\r\n\r\nBut upon finding that she was mildly treated, and on hearing that the\r\nboatmen had related every circumstance of her voyage, she confessed the\r\nwhole truth to General Campbell.\r\n\r\nThe vessel was bound for Leith. About three weeks after she had been\r\napprehended, as the ship cruized about, it approached the shore of\r\nArmadale. Here Flora was permitted to land, in order to bid adieu to her\r\nparents. She was sent ashore under a guard of two officers and a party\r\nof soldiers, and was forbidden to say anything in Erse, or anything at\r\nall except in presence of the officers. Here she stayed two hours, and\r\nthen returned to the ship. With what emotions she left the island of\r\nSkye and found herself carried as a prisoner to Leith, it is not perhaps\r\nin these tranquil days easy to conceive.\r\n\r\nAfter her apprehension, her father-in-law, Armadale, to use the phrase\r\nof some of the unfortunate Jacobites, \"began a-skulking;\" a report\r\nhaving gone about that he had given a pass to his daughter, although\r\naware that she was travelling with \"the Pretender\" disguised in woman's\r\nclothes. There was also another source of suspicion against him, which\r\nwas his having the Prince's pistols in his keeping. These were given him\r\nby Macdonald of Milton, the brother of Flora; they had been received\r\neither from Charles himself, or from O'Sullivan or O'Neil; but still\r\nthey furnished a proof of some communication between Charles Edward and\r\nArmadale. Another sufferer was Donald Roy Macdonald. Among not the least\r\nenergetic of those who aided the escape of Charles Edward from the Long\r\nIsland, was Donald Roy Macdonald. A model of the true Highland gentleman\r\nin deportment, handsome in person, his conduct fully bore out his\r\ncharacter. To this warm-hearted disinterested young man the Prince\r\nquickly attached himself. Crippled as he was, he was obliged also to\r\n\"go a-skulking.\" He concealed himself in three different caves, where by\r\nturns he made his abode for eight weeks, wrapping himself up in his\r\nplaid, and making his bed of the heather; his subsistence he owed to the\r\ncare of Lady Margaret Macdonald, who brought him food, though at the\r\nrisk of her own safety. It is consolatory to find heroic friendship, or\r\ncompassionate interest, enlivening the melancholy annals of civil\r\ncontentions, of revenge and treachery.\r\n\r\nThe sufferings of Captain Macdonald during his concealment, although\r\nalleviated by Lady Margaret's care, were nevertheless considerable.\r\nDuring the months of July and August, which he passed in the caves, the\r\nmidges and flies annoyed his frame, sensitive from the still open wound,\r\nand drove him for coolness into the recesses of the caverns. It was\r\nnecessary to be very careful in stepping out, lest the country-people\r\nshould discover his retreat. Late at night, or very early in the\r\nmorning, he crept out to supply his bottle with water from some\r\nneighbouring _burn_ or rivulet. At last, the act of indemnity set him\r\nfree. Until the month of November 1746, his wound, exasperated by\r\nconstant exertion, was very troublesome. His misery was solaced by the\r\ncare and skill of a friendly surgeon, who sent Donald Roy dressings by a\r\nproper hand, even while he remained in the cave, and at last the wound\r\nhealed. In an account of the Prince's escape, written by Donald at the\r\nrequest of Bishop Forbes, he says, \"He (Donald Roy) now walks as\r\ncleverly as ever, without any the smallest pain or halt; and made his\r\nlast journey from Skye to Edinburgh in twelve days on foot, and, as he\r\ncame along, visited several friends and acquaintances.\"[300]\r\n\r\nOne cannot help rejoicing that Lady Margaret Macdonald escaped all\r\ninconvenience, except suspicion. The conduct of her husband, Sir\r\nAlexander, had been prudent. During the progress of the insurrection he\r\nhad written to Keppoch, after the retreat from Stirling:--\"Seeing I look\r\nupon your affairs as in a desperate state, I will not join you: but\r\nthen, I assure you, I will as little rise against you.\" Of Sir\r\nAlexander's followers, a force amounting to five hundred men, only two\r\nhad joined the Prince; these were James Macdonald of the isle of\r\nHisker,[301] and Captain Donald Roy Macdonald.[302] The estates of Sir\r\nAlexander, therefore, remained uninjured, and his family continued to\r\nenjoy them.\r\n\r\nThe chief sufferers from the visit of Prince Charles to their house were\r\nMacdonald of Kingsburgh and his wife.\r\n\r\nUpon hearing of the Prince's escape, Captain Fergusson went first to\r\nMugstat; where gaining no intelligence, he proceeded to Kingsburgh. He\r\nthere examined every person with the utmost exactness, and inquired into\r\nevery particular of the accommodation afforded to one whom he styled\r\n\"the Pretender.\" \"Whom you mean by _the Pretender_, I do not pretend to\r\nguess!\" was the reply of Mrs. Macdonald of Kingsburgh.\r\n\r\nKingsburgh was made prisoner, and was sent to Fort Augustus on parole\r\nwithout any guard, by General Campbell's order. But the clemency shown\r\nby Campbell ceased when Kingsburgh reached Fort Augustus. He was thrown\r\ninto a dungeon, was plundered of everything, and loaded with irons. Sir\r\nEverard Faulkner, who was employed to examine him, reminded him how fine\r\nan opportunity he had lost of \"making himself and his family for ever.\"\r\n\"Had I gold and silver piled heap upon heap to the bulk of yon huge\r\nmountain,\" was the noble reply, \"that mass could not afford me half the\r\nsatisfaction I find in my own breast from doing what I have done!\"\r\nWhilst he was confined at Fort Augustus, an officer of distinction came\r\nto him, and asked him if he should know the Prince's head if he saw it.\r\n\"I should know the head very well if it were on the shoulders,\" was the\r\nanswer. \"But if it were not on the shoulders?\" said the officer. \"In\r\nthat case I will not pretend to know anything about it,\" returned\r\nKingsburgh. His discrimination was not put to the test.\r\n\r\nKingsburgh was removed to Edinburgh castle under a strong guard of\r\nKingston's Light-horse. He was at first put into a room with several\r\nother gentlemen, but was afterwards removed into solitary confinement,\r\nand not allowed to speak to any one, except to the officer on guard, and\r\nthe keeper, who acted as his servant. In this place he remained for a\r\nyear, when by the act of grace he was set at liberty on the fourth of\r\nJuly 1747; \"having thus,\" as an author has observed, \"got a whole year's\r\nsafe lodging for affording that of one night!\"[303]\r\n\r\nBefore her farewell to her friends in Armadale, Flora Macdonald had\r\nexchanged the vessel which Captain Fergusson commanded, for one\r\ncommanded by Commodore Smith, a gentleman capable of estimating her\r\ncharacter. At Armadale, she procured a change of clothes, and took as\r\nher personal attendant an honest girl, named Kate Macdonald, who could\r\nspeak nothing but Gaelic. This girl offered herself as a servant,\r\nfinding that Flora could get no one else to attend her in her calamity.\r\n\r\nAmong her companions in trouble, she found, on returning to the ship,\r\nCaptain O'Neil, who had persuaded her to undertake the enterprise which\r\nhad produced her present imprisonment. This gentleman had also, when he\r\nurged her good offices, proffered his hand in marriage, in order that\r\nher reputation might not suffer by her adventure by \"flood and field.\"\r\nWhen Flora saw him on board the vessel, she went up to him, and slapping\r\nhim on the cheek, said, \"To that black face I owe all my misfortune!\"\r\nO'Neil however answered, \"that, instead of being her misfortune, it was\r\nher highest honour, and it would yet redound more to her credit, if she\r\ndid not pretend to be ashamed of what she had done.\"[304] She was\r\nconfined for a short time in Dunstaffnage castle. This now ruinous\r\nfortress, once a royal residence, is situated near the mouth of Loch\r\nEtive, a short distance from Oban, in Argyleshire; it stands upon a\r\nrocky promontory which juts out into the lake, which is one of the most\r\nsecluded and solemn scenes that nature, in all the grandeur of those\r\nregions, presents.[305] Near the castle is a convenient building, which\r\nis now, as probably it was in 1745, inhabited by the factors of the Duke\r\nof Argyle, who is the hereditary keeper of Dunstaffnage castle, under\r\nthe Crown. It was probably in this house that Flora was lodged. The\r\ncastle is on three of its sides little else than a shell; but the fourth\r\nis in tolerable repair. The entrance to this sequestered and solemn\r\nabode is from the sea, by a staircase; probably in old times a\r\ndrawbridge, which fell from a staircase. The ancient grandeur of\r\nDunstaffnage, long used as one of the earliest residences of the\r\nScottish kings; famed also as the place from which the stone of\r\nDunstaffnage, sometimes called the Stone of Scone, on which they were\r\ncrowned, was brought; had long passed away before Flora tenanted its\r\nchambers. But the associations which it presented were not likely to dim\r\nthe ardour of her loyalty to the last of that race who had once held\r\ntheir sway over the proud castle of Dunstaffnage; nor would the roofless\r\nchapel, of exquisite architectural beauty, near Dunstaffnage, where many\r\nof the Scottish kings repose, be an object devoid of deep and mournful\r\ninterest to one who had lately beheld a singular instance of the\r\nmutability of all human grandeur. Two letters, which show the mode of\r\nFlora Macdonald's introduction to the keeper of the castle, Neil\r\nCampbell, have been preserved.[306] One of them is as follows:\r\n\r\n                                         \"Horse-Shoe Bay, Aug. 1746.\r\n\r\n    \"Dear Sir,\r\n\r\n    \"I must desire the favour of you to forward my letters by an express\r\n    to Inverary; and, if any are left with you, let them be sent by the\r\n    bearer. I shall stay here with Commodore Smith till Sunday morning.\r\n    If you can't come, I beg to know if you have any men now in garrison\r\n    at your house, and how many? Make my compliments to your lady, and\r\n    tell her I am obliged to desire the favour of her for some days to\r\n    receive a very pretty young rebel. Her zeal, and the persuasion of\r\n    those who ought to have given her better advice, has drawn her into\r\n    a most unhappy scrape by assisting the young Pretender to make his\r\n    escape. I need say nothing further till we meet; only assure you\r\n    that I am, dear sir, your sincere friend and humble servant,\r\n\r\n                                                    \"JOHN CAMPBELL.\"\r\n\r\n    \"I suppose you have heard of Miss Flora Macdonald.\"\r\n\r\nEarly in September the ship arrived in Leith Roads, and remained there\r\nuntil November. By this time the fame of this obscure Highland girl had\r\nreached the well-wishers to Prince Charles in Edinburgh, and many\r\ncrowded to see her. Among these was the Rev. Robert Forbes, who happened\r\nat that time to be Episcopal minister of the port. At this period the\r\nEpiscopal Church of Scotland consisted of a few scattered congregations,\r\nunder the spiritual guidance of a reduced number of titular bishops. The\r\nChurch was, however, deeply attached to the Stuarts; and the pious and\r\nenthusiastic man who now visited Flora in her adversity, was among the\r\nmost zealous of the adherents to that ill-fated cause. He had himself\r\nknown calamity, having been apprehended at St. Ninian's in the preceding\r\nyear, 1745, and imprisoned until the following May. This circumstance,\r\nwhich had prevented him from taking any active part in the commotions,\r\npreserved Mr. Forbes in safety; and his exertions, which were directed\r\nto the purpose of collecting, from such of the insurgents as fell in his\r\nway, narratives of their several parts in the events of 1745, have been\r\nvery effective. Through his efforts a valuable collection of authentic\r\nmemoirs, from which extracts have been published within these last few\r\nyears, have added a new light, and consequently a new charm, to the\r\nnarrative of Prince Charles's adventures, and to the biography of his\r\nfollowers.\r\n\r\nMr. Forbes, at the time when he visited Flora, was residing in the house\r\nof Lady Bruce of Kinross, within the walls of Cromwell's citadel at\r\nLeith. It was one part of Mr. Forbes's plan, in the pursuit of which he\r\ncontemplated forming an accurate history of the whole insurrection, to\r\nvisit the State prisoners as they were either carried to London, or\r\npassed on their return to the Highlands. Most of his collection was\r\ntherefore formed at the close of the last campaign, when the\r\nrecollections of the unfortunate actors in the affair were vivid and\r\naccurate. Among other minor occupations was the acquisition of relics of\r\nCharles Edward, whom the worthy divine almost idolized. \"Perhaps,\" says\r\nMr. Chambers,[307] \"the most curious and characteristic part of the\r\nwork is a series of relics which are found attached to the inside of the\r\nboards of certain volumes. In one I find a slip of thick blue silk\r\ncloth, of a texture like sarcenet, beneath which is written, 'The above\r\nis a piece of the Prince's garter.' Below this is a small square piece\r\nof printed linen, the figures being in lilac on a white ground, with the\r\nfollowing inscription: 'The above is a piece of the identical gown which\r\nthe Prince wore for five or six days, when he was obliged to disguise\r\nhimself in a female dress, under the name of Betty Burke. A _swatch_ of\r\nthe said gown was sent from Mrs. Macdonald of Kingsburgh,' Then follows\r\na slip of tape, with the following note: 'The following is a piece of\r\nthat identical apron-string which the Prince wore about him when in a\r\nfemale dress. The above bit I received out of Miss Flora Macdonald's own\r\nhands, upon Thursday, November 5, 1747.'\"\r\n\r\nIn 1762, this reverend enthusiast was chosen by the presbyteries of\r\nCaithness and Orkney as their bishop, and was consecrated at Cupar in\r\nFife in the same year. He was the last bishop whose charge was limited\r\nonly to those two districts.\r\n\r\nMr. Forbes was accompanied in his visits to Flora Macdonald, while at\r\nLeith, by Lady Bruce, Lady Mary Cochrane, Mrs. Clerk, and many other\r\nladies; who made valuable presents of clothes to the heroine, and who\r\nlistened to her narrative, as she delivered it to Mr. Forbes, with many\r\nexpressions of sympathy and applause. When she related that part of her\r\nvoyage from Uist in which the Prince watched over her whilst asleep,\r\nsome of these fair Jacobites cried out, \"O, madam! what a happy\r\ncreature you are, to have that dear Prince to watch over you in your\r\nsleep.\" \"I could,\" cried Mrs. Mary Clerk, \"wipe your shoes with\r\npleasure, and think it my honour to do so, when I reflect that you had\r\nthe Prince for your handmaid!\" Perhaps not the worst gift sent to Flora,\r\nduring her stay at Leith, was a thimble and needles, with white thread\r\nof different sorts, from Lady Bruce. This act of friendship Flora felt\r\nas much as any that she received, for she had suffered as much from the\r\nstate of idleness during her being in custody, as from any other\r\nprivation.[308]\r\n\r\nHer time thus passed away almost cheerfully. Her gentle, prudent, and\r\nplacid deportment won upon the esteem of those who were least friendly\r\nto her opinions. The officers who were appointed to guard her, although\r\nthey could not permit her to set her foot on shore, were pleased at the\r\nattention which she received from visitors. Commodore Smith behaved to\r\nher with fatherly regard. Whilst she was in Leith Roads, in the Eltham,\r\nhe presented her with a handsome riding-suit, in plain mounting, and\r\nsome fine linen for riding-shirts. He gave her advice how to act in her\r\ndifficult and perilous situation, and even allowed the officers to go\r\nashore to seek for good company for their prisoner; although persons who\r\nmerely came from curiosity were denied access. Captain Knowles of the\r\nBridgewater, also in the Leith Roads, was most courteous and considerate\r\nto the amiable prisoner. When her friends visited her, she was allowed\r\nto ask for such refreshments for them as she thought proper; as if she\r\nhad been at her own fireside. Easy, modest, and winning, in the midst\r\nof all her anxiety for her friends, and in the uncertainty of her own\r\nfate, she was cheerful; yet a subdued and modest gravity gave an\r\ninterest to her unpretending character. When solicited to join in the\r\namusement of dancing, she refused, alleging that her \"dancing-days were\r\nover; and that, at all events, she could not dance until she should be\r\nassured of the Prince's safety, and until she had the happiness of\r\nseeing him again.\"\r\n\r\nAt length, carrying with her the good wishes of all who had conversed\r\nwith her, Flora left the harbour of Leith. After being conveyed from\r\nplace to place, she was put on board the Royal Sovereign on the\r\ntwenty-seventh of November, the vessel then lying at the Nore, and\r\nconveyed to London. Here she was kept a prisoner under circumstances of\r\ngreat mitigation, for she was lodged in a private house. In this\r\nsituation she continued for a year; when the Act of indemnity, passed in\r\n1747, set her at liberty. She was then discharged, without a single\r\nquestion being addressed to her on the subject of her conduct. After\r\nbeing released,--at the instigation, according to a tradition in her\r\nfamily, of Frederic Prince of Wales,--she was domesticated in the family\r\nof the Dowager Lady Primrose, an ardent Jacobite, who afterwards, in\r\n1750, was courageous enough to receive the young Chevalier during a\r\nvisit of five days, which were employed by Charles in the vain endeavour\r\nto form another scheme of invasion. The abode of Lady Primrose was the\r\nresort of the fashionable world; and crowds of the higher classes\r\nhastened to pay their tribute to the heroine of the day. It may be\r\nreadily conjectured, how singular an impression the quiet, simple\r\nmanners of Flora must have made upon the excited minds of those who\r\nlooked, perhaps, for high pretensions,--for the presence of an amazon,\r\nand the expressions of an heroine of romance. The compliments which were\r\noffered to Flora, excited in her mind nothing but the most unequivocal\r\nsurprise that so simple an act should produce so extraordinary a\r\nsensation. She is stated to have been presented to Frederic Prince of\r\nWales, and to have received from him the highest compliment to her\r\nfidelity and heroism. When, in explanation of her conduct, Flora\r\nMacdonald said that she would perform the same act of humanity to any\r\nperson who might be similarly situated, the Prince remarked, \"You would,\r\nI hope, madam, do the same, were the same event to happen over again.\"\r\nThe grace and courtesy of this speech may partly be attributed to the\r\namiable traits which profligate habits had not wholly obliterated in the\r\nPrince; partly to his avowed opposition to his royal father, and the bad\r\nterms on which he stood with his brother. It must still be acknowledged,\r\nthat Frederic displayed no ordinary degree of good-feeling in this\r\ninterview with Flora. His son George the Third, and his grandson George\r\nthe Fourth, both did credit to themselves by sentiments equally generous\r\ntowards their ill-fated and royal kinsman.\r\n\r\nAfter this intoxicating scene, presenting in their most brilliant\r\ncolours, to the eye of one who had never visited either Edinburgh or\r\nLondon, the fascinations of the higher classes of society, Flora\r\nreturned to Skye. She left the metropolis unchanged in her early\r\naffections, unaltered in the simplicity of her manners. The country,\r\npresenting so lately the miserable spectacle of civil war, was now\r\ncalmed into a mournful tranquillity, as she passed through it on her\r\njourney to Skye; but in the Highlands, and more especially in the\r\nWestern Isles, the love and loyalty which had of old been devoted to the\r\nStuarts were unaltered. It was, indeed, long before they were\r\nobliterated; and, for years after the fatal 1745, the name of Charles\r\nEdward was uttered with tears. Nor is this sentiment of respect even now\r\nextinct; nor will it, perhaps, ever be wholly annihilated.\r\n\r\nThe journey from London to Skye was performed by Flora in a postchaise,\r\nand her expenses were defrayed by Lady Primrose. Her companion was, by\r\nher own choice, Malcolm Macleod of Raasay, who had met the Prince at\r\nPortree, and had completed the work begun by Flora. He too had been\r\nimprisoned, but had regained his liberty. \"So,\" afterwards Malcolm\r\nrelated to his friends, with a triumphant air, \"I went to London to be\r\nhanged, and returned in a postchaise with Miss Flora Macdonald!\" They\r\nvisited Dr. Burton, another released prisoner, at York. Here Malcolm was\r\nasked by that gentleman what was his opinion of Prince Charles. \"He is\r\nthe most cautious man not to be a coward, and the bravest not to be\r\nrash, that I ever saw,\" was the reply.\r\n\r\nIn 1750, Flora Macdonald was married to her cousin Alexander Macdonald\r\nthe younger of Kingsburgh, who appears to have been worthy of his\r\ndistinguished wife. In person, young Kingsburgh had completely the\r\nfigure of a gallant Highlander, the graceful mien and manly looks which\r\na certain popular Scots' song has attributed to that character. \"When\r\nreceiving Dr. Johnson in after-years, Kingsburgh appeared in true\r\nHighland costume, with his plaid thrown about him, a large blue bonnet\r\nwith a knot of black ribbon like a cockade, a brown short coat of a kind\r\nof duffil, a tartan waistcoat with gold buttons and gold button-holes, a\r\nbluish philibeg, and tartan hose. He had jet hair tied behind; and was a\r\nlarge stately man, with a steady sensible countenance.\"[309] Such was\r\nthe man to whom, after a short eventful period of peril and vicissitude,\r\nit was the lot of Flora Macdonald to be united. Kingsburgh is also\r\ndeclared by Boswell to have had one virtue of his country in\r\nperfection--that of hospitality; and, in this, to have far surpassed the\r\nson of Lady Margaret Macdonald, Sir Alexander Macdonald of Armadale, an\r\nEnglish-bred chieftain, at whose house Dr. Johnson and his friend \"had\r\nsmall company, and could not boast of their cheer.\" That gentleman, \"an\r\nEton-bred scholar,\" had few sympathies with the poor tenants by whom he\r\nwas surrounded. So true is Dr. Johnson's remark, \"that the Highland\r\nchiefs should not be allowed to go farther south than Aberdeen.\"\r\n\r\nIn her union with young Kingsburgh Flora enjoyed a source of\r\nsatisfaction not to be estimated lightly. She became the daughter-in-law\r\nof a man whose virtues were remembered with the deepest respect in\r\nSkye.[310] When in 1773 Dr. Johnson and Boswell visited the island, they\r\nfound Flora and her husband living in apparent prosperity in the\r\ndwelling wherein Charles Edward had been so hospitably entertained.\r\nKingsburgh the younger, as the head of the house, received the Doctor at\r\nhis door, and with respectful attention supported him into the house. A\r\ncomfortable parlour with a good fire was appropriated to the guests, and\r\nthe \"dram\" went round. Presently supper was served, and then Flora made\r\nher appearance. \"To see Dr. Samuel Johnson, the great champion of the\r\nEnglish Tories, salute Miss Flora Macdonald in the isle of Skye, was,\"\r\nas Boswell observes, \"a striking sight.\" In their notions Flora and the\r\nDoctor were in many respects congenial; and Dr. Johnson not only had\r\nimbibed a high opinion of Flora, but found that opinion confirmed on\r\nacquaintance.\r\n\r\nConversation flowed freely. Flora told him that during a recent visit to\r\nthe main land she had heard that Mr. Boswell was coming to Skye; and\r\nthat Mr. Johnson, a young English \"_buck_,\" was coming with him. Dr.\r\nJohnson was highly entertained with this fancy. He retired however early\r\nto rest, and reposed on the very bed on which Charles Edward had slept\r\nso long and so soundly on his way from Mugstat to Portree. The room was\r\ndecorated with a great variety of maps and prints; among others was\r\nHogarth's head of Wilkes grinning, with the cap of Liberty on a pole by\r\nhim. Boswell appears, as far as we can guess from his expressions, to\r\nhave shared the apartment. \"To see Dr. Samuel Johnson,\" remarks Boswell,\r\n\"lying on that bed in the isle of Skye, in the house of Miss Flora\r\nMacdonald, again struck me with such a group of ideas as it is not easy\r\nfor words to express.\" Upon Boswell giving vent to this burst of\r\nrapture, Dr. Johnson smiled and said, \"I have had no ambitious thoughts\r\nin it.\" He afterwards remarked that he would have given a great deal\r\nrather than not have lain in that bed.[311]\r\n\r\nOn quitting the house, Dr. Johnson and his friend were rowed by\r\nKingsburgh, across one of the lochs which flow in upon all the coasts of\r\nSkye, to a place called Grishinish; and here the Highland host bade his\r\nguests adieu. All seemed smiling and prosperous; but even at this time\r\nKingsburgh was embarrassed in his affairs, and contemplated going to\r\nAmerica.\r\n\r\nThat scheme was eventually accomplished. During the passion for\r\nemigration which prevailed in the Highlands, Kingsburgh removed to North\r\nCarolina, where he purchased an estate. Scarcely had he settled upon his\r\nproperty before the American war broke out. Like most of the Jacobites\r\nwho were in America at that time, he sided with the British Government.\r\nHe even took up arms in the cause, and became captain of a regiment\r\ncalled the North Carolina Highlanders. Many singular adventures occurred\r\nboth to him and to Flora in the course of the contest. At length they\r\nreturned to Skye, but not together; she sailed first. In the voyage\r\nhome, her ship encountered a French ship of war. An action ensued.\r\nWhilst the ladies among the passengers were below, Flora stayed on deck,\r\nand encouraged the sailors with her voice and manner. She was thrown\r\ndown in the confusion, and broke her arm. With her wonted vivacity she\r\nafterwards observed, that she had risked her life both for the House of\r\nStuart and for that of Brunswick, but had got very little for her\r\npains. Her husband remained in America for some time after she returned\r\nto Scotland, but joined her at last.\r\n\r\nFlora had a numerous family of sons and daughters. Charles, her eldest\r\nson, was a captain in the Queen's Rangers. He was worthy of bearing his\r\nmother's name. As his kinsman, the late Lord Macdonald, saw his remains\r\nlowered into the grave, he remarked, \"There lies the most finished\r\ngentleman of my family and name!\" Alexander, the second son, also in the\r\nKing's service, was lost at sea. Ranald, the third, was a captain of\r\nMarines. He was remarkable for his elegant person, and estimable for his\r\nhigh professional reputation. James, the fourth son, served in Tarlton's\r\nBritish Legion, and was a brave officer. The late Lieutenant-Colonel\r\nJohn Macdonald, in Exeter, long survived his brothers. This officer was\r\nintroduced to King George the Fourth, who observed, on his presentation,\r\nto those around him, \"This gentleman is the son of a lady to whom my\r\nfamily (thus designating the Stuarts) owe a great obligation.\" Of two\r\ndaughters, one, Mrs. Macleod of Lochbuy, died not many years ago.\r\n\r\nThe following letters refer to the family who have been thus\r\nenumerated.[312]\r\n\r\n\r\nFROM MRS. MACDONALD TO MRS. MACKENZIE OF DELVIN, BY DUNKELL.\r\n\r\n                                 \"Dunvegan, twenty-fourth July, 1780\r\n\r\n    \"Dear Madam,\r\n\r\n    \"I arrived at Inverness the third day after parting with you, in\r\n    good health and without any accidents, which I always dread; my\r\n    young 'squire continued always very obliging and attentive to me. I\r\n    stayed at Inverness for three days. I had the good-luck to meet with\r\n    a female companion from that to Skye. I was the fourth day, with\r\n    great difficulty, at Raasay, for my hands being so pained with the\r\n    riding.\r\n\r\n    \"I arrived here a few days ago with my young daughter, who promises\r\n    to be a stout Highland dairg, quite overgrown of her age. Nanny and\r\n    her small family are well: her husband was not sailed the last\r\n    accounts she had from him.\r\n\r\n    \"I have the pleasure to inform you, upon my arrival here, that I had\r\n    two letters from my husband; the latter dated tenth May. He was then\r\n    in very good health, and informs me that my son Charles has got the\r\n    command of a troop of horse in Lord Cathcart's regiment. But alas! I\r\n    have heard nothing since I left you about my son Sandy,[313] which\r\n    you may be sure gives me great uneasiness; but still hope for the\r\n    best.\r\n\r\n    \"By public and private news, I hope we will soon have peace\r\n    re-established, to our great satisfaction: which, as it's a thing\r\n    long expected and wished for, will be for the utility of the whole\r\n    nation; especially to poor me, that has my all engaged,--fond to\r\n    hear news, and yet afraid to get it.\r\n\r\n    \"I wait here till a favourable opportunity for the Long Island shall\r\n    offer itself.--As I am upon all occasions under the greatest\r\n    obligations to you, would you get a letter from my son Johny sooner\r\n    than I would get one from him, you would very much oblige me by\r\n    dropping me a few lines communicating to me the most material part\r\n    of his letter.\r\n\r\n    \"I hope you and the ladies of your family will always accept of my\r\n    kindest respects; and I ever am, with esteem, dear madam, your\r\n    affectionate, humble servant,\r\n\r\n                                                   \"FLORA MACDONALD.\r\n\r\n    \"Please direct to me, to Mrs. Macdonald, late of Kingsborrow, South\r\n    Uist, by Dunvegan.\"\r\n\r\nTwo years, it seems, elapsed, and the summer of 1782 arrived, and the\r\nfate of Alexander Macdonald was still unknown; yet the mother's heart\r\nstill clung to hope, as it proved by the following letter. No murmurs\r\nescape from one who seems to have sustained unrepiningly the sorrows\r\nwhich reach the heart most truly; the wreck of fortune, not for\r\nourselves, but for our children, and the terrors of suspense. One source\r\nof consolation she possessed: her surviving sons were brave, honourable,\r\nand respected. But \"Sandy\" never returned.\r\n\r\n\r\nMRS. MACKENZIE OF DELVINE, BY DUNKELL.\r\n\r\n                                       \"Milton, third of July, 1782.\r\n\r\n    \"Dear Madam,\r\n\r\n    \"I received your agreeable favour a fortnight ago, and am happy to\r\n    find that your health is not worse than when I left you. I return\r\n    you my sincere thanks for your being so mindful of me as to send me\r\n    the agreeable news about Johny's arrival, which relieved me from a\r\n    great deal of distress, as that was the first accounts I had of him\r\n    since he sailed. I think, poor man! he has been very lucky, for\r\n    getting into bread so soon after landing. I had a letter from John,\r\n    which, I suppose, came by the same conveyance with yours. I am told\r\n    by others that it will be in his power now to show his talents, as\r\n    being in the engineer department. He speaks feelingly of the\r\n    advantages he got in his youth, and the good example showed him,\r\n    which I hope will keep him from doing anything that is either sinful\r\n    or shameful.[314]\r\n\r\n    \"I received a letter from Captain Macdonald, my husband, dated from\r\n    Halifax, the twelfth of November '82; he was then recovering his\r\n    health, but had been very tender for some time before. My son\r\n    Charles is captain in the British Legion, and James a lieutenant in\r\n    the same: they are both in New York. Ranald is captain of Marines,\r\n    and was with Rodney at the taking of St. Eustatia. As for my son\r\n    Sandy, who was a-missing, I had accounts of his being carried to\r\n    Lisbon, but nothing certain, which I look upon the whole as a\r\n    hearsay; but the kindness of Providence is still to be looked upon,\r\n    as I have no reason to complain, as God has been pleased to spare\r\n    his father and the rest. I am now at my brother's house, on my way\r\n    to Skye, to attend my daughter, who is to lie-in in August; they are\r\n    all in health at present. As for my health at present, it's\r\n    tolerable, considering my anxious mind and distress of times.\r\n\r\n    \"It gives me a great deal of pleasure to hear such good accounts of\r\n    young Mr. M'Kinnie:[315] no doubt he has a great debt to pay, who\r\n    represents his worthy and amiable uncle. I hope you will be so good\r\n    as remember me to your female companions. I do not despair of the\r\n    pleasure of seeing you once more, if peace was restored; and I am,\r\n    dear madam, with respect and esteem, your affectionate friend,\r\n\r\n                                                  \"FLORA MACDONALD.\"\r\n\r\nFlora died in 1790, having attained the age of seventy. Her corpse was\r\ninterred, wrapt in the sheet on which Charles Edward had lain at\r\nKingsburgh, and which she had carried with her to America, intending\r\nthat, wherever she should be entombed, it should serve as her\r\nwinding-sheet.\r\n\r\nThe life and character of Flora Macdonald exemplify how true it is,\r\nthat, in the performance of daily duties, and in domestic life, the\r\nloftiest qualities of woman may be formed; for the hourly practice of\r\nself-controul, the exercise of judgment, the acquisition of fortitude,\r\ntend to the perfection of those virtues which ennobled her career. In\r\nall her trials she acted a woman's part. Her spirit was fortified by a\r\nstrength that was ever gentle. She was raised by circumstances above a\r\nprivate sphere; when these ceased to actuate her, she returned\r\ncheerfully to what many might deem obscurity, but which she gladdened by\r\na kind and cheerful temper. No vain-glory, no egotism, vulgarized her\r\none great effort. The simplicity of her character was inherent and\r\nunextinguishable; and the deep interest which was attached to her\r\ncharacter was never lessened by any display. Her enthusiasm for the\r\nStuart cause ceased only with her life. When any person thoughtlessly,\r\nor cruelly, applied the term \"Pretender\" to the Prince whom she\r\nreverenced, her anger for a moment was aroused. But contention ill\r\naccorded with the truly feminine, yet noble and well-principled, mind of\r\nFlora Macdonald. Upon the error or truth of that belief in hereditary\r\nand indefeasible right which she entertained, it is of little moment, in\r\nestimating her virtues, to pass an opinion. Perhaps we may venture to\r\nconclude with Dr. Johnson, \"that being in rebellion, from a notion of\r\nanother's right, is not connected with depravity; and that we had this\r\nproof of it, that all mankind applaud the pardoning of rebels, which\r\nthey would not do in the case of murderers and robbers.\"\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[274] General Stewart's Sketches of the Highlanders, vol. ii. p. 5.

Among his\r\nforefathers were men eminent for loyalty, and distinguished for bravery,\r\nand of honour as untainted as their blood; but when William, fourth Earl\r\nof Kilmarnock, succeeded to his title, there was little except this high\r\nancestry to elate him with pride, or to raise him above dependence upon\r\ncircumstances.\r\n\r\nThe Earl of Kilmarnock derived his title from a royal borough of the\r\nsame name, in the shire of Cunningham in Ayrshire; and, in former times\r\nwhen the chieftainship was in repute in that part of Scotland, that\r\nbranch of the family of Boyd, or Boyde, from whom the Earl was\r\ndescended, claimed to be chiefs.\r\n\r\nThe greatness of the Boyd family commenced with Simon, the brother of\r\nWalter, first High Steward of Scotland, and founder of the Monastery of\r\nPaisley, in 1160. Robert, the son of Simon, is designated in the\r\nfoundation church of that monastery, as nephew of Walter, High Steward;\r\nand is distinguished on account of his fair complexion, by the word\r\nBoyt, or Boyd,[316] from the Celtic Boidh, signifying fair, or yellow.\r\n\"He was,\" says Nisbet, \"doubtless, predecessor to the Lords Boyd, and\r\nEarls of Kilmarnock.\"[317]\r\n\r\nThe family of Boyd continued to flourish until, in the fifteenth\r\ncentury, it was ennobled by James the Third, who owed to one of its\r\nmembers, Sir Alexander Boyd of Duncow, esteemed to be a mirror of\r\nchivalry, an inculcation into the military exercises, which were deemed,\r\nin those days, essential to the education of royalty. But the sunshine\r\nof kingly favour was not enjoyed by the Boyds without some alloy. Robert\r\nBoyd of Kilmarnock, who was raised to the peerage, under the title of\r\nLord Boyd, and whose eldest son was created Earl of Arran, experienced\r\nvarious vicissitudes. He died in England, in exile; and his brother, Sir\r\nAlexander, perished in 1469, on a scaffold, erected on the Castle Hill\r\nof Edinburgh. The fortunes of the family were, however, restored in the\r\nperson of Thomas, Earl of Arran, who married the eldest sister of King\r\nJames the Third. The beautiful island of Arran was given as the dower of\r\nthis lady: and her husband, who is said in the Paston Letters to have\r\nbeen a \"light, clever, and well-spoken, fair archer; devoutest, most\r\nperfect, and truest to his lady, of Knights,\" enjoyed a short gleam of\r\nroyal favour. His vicissitudes, however, befel him whilst on an embassy\r\nin Denmark, his enemies undermined him at home: he was driven to wander\r\nin foreign countries, and died at Antwerp, where a magnificent monument\r\nwas erected to his memory, by Charles the Bold, Duke of Burgundy. His\r\ntitle was attainted, but his property was restored to his son; and in\r\n1655, the title of Earl of Kilmarnock was added to that of Lord Boyd,\r\nwhich alone seems to have been retained by the family during the\r\nintervening generations.\r\n\r\nDuring the reign of Charles the First, his descendants were considered\r\nto be steady Royalists; but, notwithstanding their claiming descent from\r\nthe Stuarts, the views and principles of the family in the troublous\r\nperiod of the Revolution of 1688, underwent a total change. William, the\r\nthird Earl of Kilmarnock, and the father of the unhappy adherent of\r\nCharles Edward, took the oaths of allegiance to the reigning family, and\r\nsupported the Treaty of Union; joining at first the party entitled the\r\n_Squadrone volante_; but eventually deserting them for the Whigs. When\r\nthe Insurrection of 1715 broke out, this nobleman plainly manifested\r\nthat the notions which had actuated his ancestor to join the association\r\nat Cumberland in favour of Charles the First, were no longer deemed\r\nvalid by him. The superiority of the Burgh of Kilmarnock having been\r\ngranted in 1672 to his ancestors, the Earl summoned the inhabitants of\r\nthe Burgh to assemble, and to arm themselves in support of Government.\r\nAt the general meeting of the fencible corps at Cunningham, Lord\r\nKilmarnock appeared, followed by five hundred of his men, well armed,\r\nand so admirably trained, that they made the best figure on that\r\noccasion among the forces collected.[318] In compliance with orders\r\nwhich he received from the Duke of Argyll, Lord Kilmarnock marched with\r\nhis volunteers to garrison the houses of Drummakil, Cardross, and\r\nGastartan, in order to prevent the rebels from crossing the Forth.\r\nUnhappily for the fortunes of his family, the Earl died two years\r\nafterwards: and in the year 1717, his son, then a boy of fourteen years\r\nof age, succeeded to his title.\r\n\r\nThe mother of the young nobleman still survived: she was the Lady\r\nEupheme, daughter of William, eleventh Earl of Ross; and one child only,\r\nthe Earl of Kilmarnock, had been the issue of her marriage.\r\n\r\nThe youth, whose fate afterwards extorted pity from the most prejudiced\r\nspectators of his fate, was educated in the principles of the Scottish\r\nChurch. These, as the chaplain who attended Lord Kilmarnock in the last\r\ndays of his existence observes, are far from \"having the least tendency\r\nto sedition,\" and a very different bias was apparent in the conduct of\r\nthe Presbyterian ministers during the whole course of the insurrections\r\nof 1745. The young nobleman appears to have imbibed, with this\r\npersuasion, a sincere conviction of those incontrovertible, and\r\nall-important truths of Christianity which, happily, the contentions of\r\nsect cannot nullify, nor the passions of mankind assail. \"He always\r\nbelieved,\" such is his own declaration, \"in the great truths of God's\r\nBeing and Providence, and in a future state of rewards and punishments\r\nfor virtue and vice.\" He had never, he declared at that solemn moment\r\nwhen nothing appeared to him of consequence save truth, \"been involved\r\nin the fashionable scepticism of the times.\" As he grew up, a character\r\nmore amiable than energetic, and dispositions more calculated to inspire\r\nlove than to insure respect, manifested themselves in the young\r\nnobleman. He was singularly handsome, being tall and slender, and\r\npossessing what was termed by an eyewitness of his trial, \"an extreme\r\nfine person;\" he was mild, and well-bred, humble, and conscientious. It\r\nis true, that in his hours of penitence he recalled, with anguish, \"a\r\ncareless and dissolute life,\" by which, as he affirmed, he reduced\r\nhimself to great and perplexing difficulties; he repented for his \"love\r\nof vanity and addictedness to impurity and sensual pleasure,\" which had\r\n\"brought pollution and guilt upon his soul, and debased his reason, and,\r\nfor a time, suspended the exercise of his social affections, which were,\r\nby nature, strong in him, and, in particular, the love of his country.\"\r\nSuch was his own account of that youth, which, deprived of the guidance\r\nof a father, with high rank and great personal attractions to endanger\r\nit, was passed, according to his own confession, in dissipation and\r\nfolly. It appears, nevertheless, that he was greatly respected by his\r\nneighbours and tenantry, who were not, perhaps, disposed to judge very\r\nseverely the errors of a young and popular man.\r\n\r\nWhen only eleven years of age, Lord Kilmarnock, then Lord Boyd, had\r\nappeared in arms for Government with his father; on which occasion he\r\nconducted himself so gracefully as to attract the admiration of all\r\nbeholders.[319] His early prepossessions, granting that they may have\r\naccorded with those of his father, were, however, soon dissipated when\r\nhe allied himself with a family who had been conspicuous in the Jacobite\r\ncause. This was the house of Livingstone, Earl of Linlithgow and\r\nCalendar; George, the fourth Earl, having, in 1715, been engaged in the\r\ninsurrection under Lord Mar, had been attainted, and his estate of one\r\nthousand two hundred and ninety-six pounds yearly forfeited to the\r\nCrown. Nor has this forfeiture ever been reversed; and the present\r\nrepresentative of the family, Sir Thomas Livingstone, of Westquarter and\r\nBedlormie, remains, notwithstanding an appeal in 1784 before Lord\r\nKenyon, then Attorney-General, a commoner.[320]\r\n\r\nLady Anne Livingstone, who was the object of the young Lord Kilmarnock's\r\nchoice, is reported to have been a woman of great beauty, and, from her\r\nexertions in her husband's behalf, appears to have possessed a fine,\r\ndetermined spirit. Although her father's title was not restored, she had\r\nsufficient interest, in 1721, to obtain from the English Government a\r\nlease of the forfeited estates for fifty-nine years, at the rent of\r\neight hundred and seventy-two pounds, twelve shillings per annum.[321]\r\nThis was, no doubt, a source of considerable pecuniary benefit to her,\r\nand also of assistance, very greatly required by Lord Kilmarnock, who\r\nwas in impoverished circumstances. Honours, indeed, centered in him, but\r\nwere productive of no real benefit. By the grandmother of his wife, the\r\nLady Margaret Hay, sole surviving daughter of Charles the twelfth Earl\r\nof Errol, he had a claim to that Earldom, which, coupling with its\r\ndignity that of the hereditary High Constable of Scotland, descended in\r\nthe female line, and after the death of a brother in infancy,\r\nconstituted the Lady Anne Livingstone a Countess of Errol in her own\r\nright. Thus, Lord Kilmarnock had, to borrow Horace Walpole's expression,\r\n\"four earldoms in him,\" Kilmarnock, Errol, Linlithgow, and Calendar; and\r\nyet he is said to have been so poor, as \"often to have wanted a dinner.\"\r\nBut to this mode of expression we must not entirely trust for accuracy.\r\nWith the inheritance of the Earldoms of Errol, and of Linlithgow, and\r\nCalendar, there came a stock of old Jacobite principles; Lord Linlithgow\r\nhad, indeed, suffered what was perhaps worse than death for his\r\nadherence to James Stuart. The Earl of Errol, the grandfather of Lady\r\nKilmarnock, had led a more prudent course. Still he was a hearty\r\nJacobite, and though, as Lockhart declares, he did not at first make a\r\n\"great outward appearance,\" yet he was much trusted by the party; his\r\nfamily had always been favourable to the Stuarts, and he was, also,\r\ngenerally considered to cherish similar sentiments.[322] He had,\r\nnevertheless, taken the oaths to Government in 1705; yet on the alarm of\r\nan invasion in 1708, he was deemed so dangerous a person that he was\r\nsent as a prisoner to Edinburgh Castle, where he died.\r\n\r\nThe love suit of Lord Kilmarnock was not likely, under his impoverished\r\ncircumstances, to prosper uninterruptedly. When he succeeded to his\r\nestate he had found it much encumbered, and a considerable portion of\r\nthe old inheritance alienated. Lord Kilmarnock's disposition was not\r\nformed for economy; he was generous even to profusion, and, as we have\r\nseen had not escaped the temptations incident to his age. His addresses\r\nto the Lady Anne Livingstone are said to have been prompted by his\r\nnecessities; her fortune was deemed considerable; and her family, well\r\nknowing the state of the Earl's affairs, regarded his proposals of\r\nmarriage unfavourably. But the young nobleman during the course of his\r\ncourtship, and in opposing these objections, formed an interest in the\r\nheart of the young lady. He was, indeed, a man born to charm the\r\nimagination of the romantic, if not at that period of his youth, to\r\nrivet affection by esteem. In his boyhood, although he made some degree\r\nof progress in classical attainments, and even in philosophy and\r\nmathematics, thus proving that natural ability was not wanting, he was\r\nfar more successful in attaining mere accomplishments, which add a\r\npowerful charm to comeliness and symmetry than in mastering more solid\r\nstudies. He became an adept in fencing, in riding, in drawing, and also\r\nin music; and acquired the distinctive and comprehensive designation, of\r\nbeing \"a polite gentleman.\"[323]\r\n\r\nDisgusted with the cold discussions on settlements and rent rolls, and\r\ndisregarding maternal cautions, Lady Anne soon followed the dictates of\r\nher own heart. She married the young and handsome nobleman without her\r\nmother's consent, and a tardy sanction to the union was wrung from Lady\r\nLivingstone only when it was too late to withhold her approval.\r\n\r\nThe marriage was not, it was said by those who were disposed to\r\nscandalize the Earl of Kilmarnock, productive of happiness. The young\r\nCountess was possessed, indeed, of beauty, wit, and good sense: but her\r\nhusband, if we may accredit the memoirs of his life, gave her much cause\r\nto complain of his conduct. They lived, however, as the same doubtful\r\nauthority states, \"if not happily, at least civilly together.\" Such is\r\nthe statement of a contemporary writer; it must, however, be adopted\r\nwith just as much allowance as we give to similar reports raised by\r\nparty writers in the present day: and it will be shown[324] not to\r\naccord with the dying declarations of Lord Kilmarnock. \"I leave behind,\"\r\nhe wrote to his agent, \"in Lady Kilmarnock, what is dearest to me.\"[325]\r\nSubsequently to his marriage, Lord Kilmarnock's necessities and the\r\nadditional burden of a family induced him to apply to the English\r\nGovernment for a pension, founded, as it is probable, on his father's\r\nservices to Government in 1715. But this statement, and the conditions\r\nupon which the bounty was given are left in obscurity. \"Whether,\" says\r\nthe anonymous biographer of Lord Kilmarnock, \"my Lord Kilmarnock's\r\npension was a ministerial bribe, or a royal bounty, is a question I\r\ncannot determine with any certainty; but I have reason to suspect the\r\nformer, since few pensions, granted by a certain administration, that of\r\nSir Robert Walpole, deserved the latter.\" The same writer truly\r\nobserves, that little or no dependance is to be placed on that loyalty\r\nwhich wants the support of bribes and pensions. \"The practice,\" he adds,\r\n\"is too general, and a defection of this kind of men may be fatal to\r\nthe state.\"[326] The pension, as it appears from Horace Walpole's\r\nletters, was taken from Lord Kilmarnock by Lord Wilmington. \"Lord\r\nKilmarnock,\" he writes to Sir Horace Mann, \"is a Presbyterian, with four\r\nearldoms in view, but so poor since Lord Wilmington's stopping a pension\r\nthat my father had given him, that he often wanted a dinner.\"[327]\r\n\r\nIn the last days of his existence the Earl, indeed, acknowledged that\r\nthe state of his affairs was, in part, the reason of his defection from\r\nGovernment. He attributed it, (though, it must be stated, under the\r\npressing arguments of a minister of religion who considered what he\r\ntermed \"rebellion\" as the most heinous sin,) to the great and pressing\r\ndifficulties into which he had brought himself, by extravagance and\r\ndissipation: and declared, according to the account of his spiritual\r\nguide, that the \"exigency of his affairs was very pressing at the time\r\nof the rebellion; and that, besides the general hope he had of mending\r\nhis fortune by the success of it, he was also tempted by another\r\nprospect, of retrieving his circumstances if he followed the Pretender's\r\nstandard.\"[328]\r\n\r\nUntil the commencement of the insurrection of 1745, Lord Kilmarnock\r\nenjoyed the possession of Dean Castle, a very ancient edifice, situated\r\nabout half a mile north east of the town of Kilmarnock, in Ayrshire. \"It\r\nis,\" says Grose in his Antiquities of Scotland, \"at a small distance\r\nfrom the main road leading from Kilmarnock to Stewarton, and consists of\r\na large vaulted square tower, which seems to have been built about the\r\nbeginning of the fifteenth century: this is surrounded by a court and\r\nother buildings more modern.\"[329] Such is the description of Dean\r\nCastle before the year 1735; when, to add to Lord Kilmarnock's other\r\nnecessities, it was partially destroyed by fire, leaving only a ruin\r\nwhich he was too much impoverished even to restore to its former\r\nhabitable state. In the \"great square tower,\" referred to by Grose, and\r\nof which a view is preserved in his work on Scotland, the Boyd family\r\nhad dwelt in the days of their greatness, when one of their race was\r\ncreated Earl of Arran. In that tower had the Earl imprisoned his royal\r\nwife, the Lady Margaret, sister of James the Third, who was divorced\r\nfrom him, pleading, as some say, a prior contract with the Lord\r\nHamilton, to whom she was afterwards united, taking to him the Isle of\r\nArran as her dower.\r\n\r\nIt does not appear that the Earl of Kilmarnock was originally in the\r\nconfidence of the Jacobite party: and their designs were not only\r\nmatured, but far in full operation before he took an open or active part\r\nin the Stuart cause. It happened, however, that when Charles Edward\r\nresided at Holyrood, the Countess of Kilmarnock was living in Edinburgh.\r\nHer beauty, and the gaiety of her manners, attracted the admiration of\r\nthe young Prince, who bestowed no small portion of attention on the\r\nfascinating daughter of one of his father's adherents. Lady Kilmarnock\r\nwas as much attached to pleasure as the young and beautiful usually are:\r\nshe delighted in public diversions, and led the way to all parties of\r\namusement. Her ambition, no less than her early prepossessions\r\nconspired, it is said, to make her a Jacobite; and she hoped, by the\r\nfavour of Charles Edward, to obtain the restoration of her father's\r\ntitle. Her entreaties to the Earl of Kilmarnock to join the standard of\r\nthe Prince were stimulated, therefore, by a double motive; and, indeed,\r\nto a generous and romantic mind, there required neither the inducements\r\nof ambition, nor of gratified vanity, to espouse that part which seemed\r\nmost natural to the Scotch. After the battle of Preston Pans, Lady\r\nKilmarnock's persuasions took effect: her husband presented himself to\r\nthe young Chevalier, who received him with every mark of esteem and\r\ndistinction, declared him a member of the privy council, raised him to\r\nthe rank of a general, and appointed him colonel of his guards.[330]\r\n\r\nAnother occurrence is, however, stated to have had a considerable\r\ninfluence in forming the Earl's decision.\r\n\r\nDuring the course of the conflict, he met, at Linlithgow, that\r\nincomparable man, and excellent officer, Colonel Gardiner. This\r\nindividual, whose character forms so fine a relief to the party-spirited\r\nand debased condition of the British army in the time of George the\r\nSecond, was a native of Linlithgowshire, having been born at Carriden,\r\nin the year of the Revolution, 1688. His life commencing in that\r\nimportant era, had been one of events. He had first entered the Dutch\r\nservice; then had served in Marlborough's army at Ramilies. Until this\r\nincident of his life, the young soldier, then only nineteen, had run a\r\ncourse of dissolute pleasure, and had obtained, from the frankness and\r\ngaiety of his disposition, the name of the _happy rake_. Being in the\r\nForlorn hope, he was wounded, and left in a state hovering between life\r\nand death, on the field, and in state of partial insensibility, from\r\nwhich he was aroused at times to perfect consciousness.\r\n\r\nThe ball which had struck Gardiner, had entered his mouth; and without\r\nbreaking a single tooth, or touching the forepart of his tongue, had\r\npassed through his neck, coming out above an inch and a half on the left\r\nside of the vertebrae. He was abandoned by Marlborough's troops, who,\r\naccording to their custom, left the wounded to their fate, while they\r\npursued their advantages against the French.\r\n\r\nIn this state, the first serious emotions of gratitude, the first\r\nconvictions of a peculiar Providence suggested themselves to the mind of\r\nthe young officer: and although they did not, for some years, produce an\r\nabsolute amendment of life, they laid the foundation of his future\r\nconversion, and of that exemplary piety and purity which extorted\r\nadmiration even in a dissolute age. After being present at every battle\r\nthat Marlborough had fought in Flanders, Colonel Gardiner had signalized\r\nhis courage in the Insurrection of 1715; and in 1745 he was again\r\nordered to the north to meet the Jacobite forces near Edinburgh.[331]\r\n\r\nIt was during this, his last campaign, when broken by ill health and\r\npremature age, for this brave and good man despaired of the restoration\r\nof peace to his country, that he supped in company with Lord Kilmarnock,\r\nat Linlithgow. Colonel Gardiner's prognostications had long been most\r\ngloomy. \"I have heard him say,\" declared Dr. Doddridge, \"many years\r\nbefore the Scottish Insurrection, that a few thousands might have a\r\nfair chance for marching from Edinburgh to London, uncontrolled, and\r\nthrow the whole kingdom into an astonishment.\" This opinion was derived\r\nfrom his knowledge of the defenceless state of the country, and the\r\ngeneral prevailing disaffection. And the pious, but somewhat distrustful\r\nviews of Gardiner led him to assign yet more solemn reasons for his\r\nanticipations of evil. \"For my own part, though I fear nothing for\r\nmyself, my apprehensions for the public are very gloomy, considering the\r\ndeplorable prevalency of almost all kinds of wickedness among us; the\r\nnatural consequences of the contempt of the Gospel. I am daily offering\r\nup my prayers to God for this sinful land of ours, over which His\r\njudgments seem to be gathering; and my strength is sometimes so\r\nexhausted with those strong cries and tears, which I pour out before God\r\nupon this occasion, that I am hardly able to stand when I arise from my\r\nknees.\"[332]\r\n\r\nImbued with these convictions, Colonel Gardiner, when he was retreating\r\nat Linlithgow with the troops under his command, spoke unguardedly to\r\nLord Kilmarnock of the prospects of the English army, and thus confirmed\r\nthe wavering inclination of that ill-fated nobleman to follow Charles\r\nEdward.[333] The decisive step was not, it appears, taken until after\r\nthe battle of Preston Pans, in which Colonel Gardiner, who had a\r\nmournful presentiment of the event of that engagement, fell, after a\r\ndeportment truly worthy of the British soldier, and of the Christian.\r\nThis brave officer, after having received two wounds, fought on, his\r\nfeeble frame animated by the almost supernatural force of strong\r\ndetermination. As he headed a party of foot who had lost their leader,\r\nand cried out, \"Fire on, my lads, fear nothing;\" his right-arm was cut\r\ndown by a Highlander who advanced with a scythe, fastened to a pole. He\r\nwas dragged from his horse; and the work of butchery was completed by\r\nanother Highlander, who struck him on the head with a broadsword:\r\nGardiner had only power to say to his servant, \"Take care of yourself.\"\r\nThe faithful creature hastened to an adjoining mill for a cart to convey\r\nhis master to a place of safety. It was not until two hours had elapsed,\r\nthat he was able to return. The mangled body, all stripped and\r\nplundered, was, even then, still breathing; and the agony of that\r\ngallant spirit was protracted until the next day, when he expired in the\r\nhouse of the minister of Tranent.\r\n\r\nThis digression, introducing as it does, one of the _real_ heroes of\r\nthis mournful period, may be pardoned.\r\n\r\nAccording to the evidence on his trial, Lord Kilmarnock first joined the\r\nstandard of Charles Edward on the \"banks of the river which divides\r\nEngland from Scotland;\"[334] but Maxwell of Kirkconnel mentions that the\r\nEarl marched from Edinburgh on the thirty-first of October, 1745, at the\r\nhead of a little squadron of horse grenadiers, with whom were some\r\nPerthshire gentlemen, who, in the absence of their own commander, were\r\nplaced under the conduct of Lord Kilmarnock.[335] After this decisive\r\nstep, Lord Kilmarnock continued to follow Charles during the whole of\r\nthat ill-fated campaign, which ended in the battle of Culloden. During\r\nthe various events of that disastrous undertaking, his character, like\r\nthat of many other commanders in the Chevalier's army, suffered from\r\nimputations of cruelty. That this vice was not accordant with his\r\ngeneral disposition of mind, the minister who attended him on his\r\ndeath-bed sufficiently attests. \"For myself,\" declares Mr. Foster, \"I\r\nmust do this unhappy criminal the justice to own, that he _never_\r\nappeared, during the course of my attendance upon him, to be of any\r\nother than a soft, benevolent disposition. His behaviour was always mild\r\nand temperate. I could discern no resentment, no disturbance or\r\nagitation in him.\"[336] So gentle a character is not the growth of a\r\nday; and if ever Lord Kilmarnock were betrayed into actions of violence,\r\nit must have been under circumstances of a peculiar nature.\r\n\r\nAmong other charges which were specified against him, was a\r\nparticipation in the blowing up of the church of St. Ninian's, in the\r\nretreat from Stirling. But when, in the retirement of his prison\r\nchamber, the unfortunate nobleman reviewed his conduct, and confessed\r\nthe errors of his life, he fully and satisfactorily cleared himself from\r\nthe heinous imputation implied in this work of destruction. When the\r\narmy of Charles were retiring from Stirling he was confined to his bed\r\nill of a fever. The first intimation that he had of the blowing up of\r\nthe tower of St. Ninian's was the noise, of which he never could obtain\r\na clear account. By the insurgents it was represented as accidental:\r\n\"this can I certainly say, as to myself, that I had no knowledge before\r\nhand, nor any concurrence in a designed act of cruelty.\" Such was Lord\r\nKilmarnock's declaration to Mr. Foster.\r\n\r\nAnother instance of barbarity also laid to the charge of the Earl was,\r\nhis alleged treatment of certain prisoners of war who were intrusted to\r\nhis care in the church of Inverness. He was accused of stripping these\r\nunfortunate persons of their clothes. Upon this point he admitted that\r\nan order to deprive the prisoners of their garments for the use of the\r\nHighlanders was issued by Charles Edward: that the warrant for executing\r\nthis order was sent to him. He did not, as he declared, enter the church\r\nin person, but committed the office of execution to an inferior officer.\r\nThe prisoners, as might be expected, refused to submit to this\r\nindignity; upon which a second order was issued, and their clothes were\r\ntaken from them. The well-timed remonstrance of Boyer, Marquis\r\nD'Eguilles, who had been sent by the court of France in the character of\r\nAmbassador to Charles Edward, arrested, however, the act of cruelty,\r\nwhich not even extreme necessity can excuse. This nobleman had arrived\r\nsome time previously at Montrose, bringing in the ship in which he\r\nsailed, arms and a small sum of money,[337] and his influence, which was\r\nexerted in behalf of the captives, was happily considerable. He\r\nrepresented to the Earl of Kilmarnock, that the rules of war did not\r\nauthorise the outrage which was contemplated. Lord Kilmarnock, convinced\r\nby his remarks, repaired to Charles Edward, leaving heaps of the clothes\r\nlying in the streets of Inverness, with sentinels standing to guard\r\nthem. By the arguments which he addressed to the Prince, these garments\r\nwere restored to their unfortunate owners; and a great stain on the\r\nmemory both of Charles and of his adherent was thus partially effaced.\r\n\r\nOf such a nature were those imputations which were charged upon Lord\r\nKilmarnock; but they appear to have met with only a transient credence;\r\nwhilst a general impression of his gentleness, and a prevailing regret\r\nfor his fate endured as long as the memory of the dire contest, and of\r\nits tragical termination, dwelt in the recollection of those who\r\nwitnessed those mournful times.\r\n\r\nAfter the battle of Culloden, the prisoners were immediately set free.\r\nThe Duke of Cumberland, as he entered Inverness, taking his road amid\r\nthe carcasses of the dead strewed in the way, called for the keys of the\r\nprisons, and with his own hands released the captives there, and,\r\nclapping them on the shoulders as they came down stairs, exclaimed,\r\n\"brother soldiers, you are free.\"[338] Unfortunately his compassion was\r\nof a party nature, and was only aroused for his own adherents.\r\n\r\nAt Culloden, fatal to so many brave men, Lord Kilmarnock was spared only\r\nto taste much more deeply of the pangs of death than if he had met it in\r\nbattle. His fate had, indeed, been anticipated by the superstitious; and\r\nit was considered a rash instance of hardihood in the unfortunate\r\nnobleman to resist an omen which, about a year before the rebellion had\r\nbroken out, is said to have happened in his house.\r\n\r\nOne day, as the maid who attended usually upon Lady Kilmarnock was\r\ninspecting some linen in an upper room of Dean Castle, the door of the\r\napartment suddenly opened of its own accord, and the view of a bloody\r\nhead, resembling that of Lord Kilmarnock, was presented to the\r\naffrighted woman. As she gazed in horror, the head rolled near her. She\r\nendeavoured in vain to repel it with her foot. She became powerless, but\r\nshe was still able to scream; her shrieks brought Lord Kilmarnock and\r\nhis Countess to the chamber. The apparition had vanished; but she\r\nrelated succinctly the story \"which, at that time,\" says the historian\r\nwho repeats it,[339] \"Lord Kilmarnock too much ridiculed, though it\r\ncould have been wished that he had been forewarned by the omen. Such was\r\nthe superstition of the times, in which ignorance and credulity found\r\nsuch ready supporters.\"\r\n\r\nAt Culloden, this ill-fated nobleman occupied a post not far from the\r\nPrince, in the rear of whom was a line of reserve, consisting of three\r\ncolumns, the first of which, on the left, was commanded by Lord\r\nKilmarnock; the centre column by Lord Lewis Gordon and Glenbucket; and\r\nthe right by the justly-celebrated Roy Stewart. In the opposite ranks,\r\nan ensign in the royal regiment, was his son, Lord Boyd. During the\r\nconfusion of the fight, when half-blinded by the smoke, the unhappy Lord\r\nKilmarnock, as if fated to fulfil the omen, mistook a party of English\r\nDragoons for FitzJames's Horse, and was accordingly taken prisoner. He\r\nwas led along the lines of the British infantry. The vaunted beauty of\r\nhis countenance, and the matchless graces of which so much has been\r\nsaid, were now obliterated by the disorder of his person, and his\r\nhumiliating position. His hat had been lost in the conflict, and his\r\nlong hair fell about his face. The soldiers as he was led along stood in\r\nmute compassion at this sight. Among those who thus looked upon this\r\nunfortunate man was his son, Lord Boyd, who was constrained to witness,\r\nwithout attempting to alleviate, the distress of that moment. When the\r\nEarl passed the place where his son stood, the youth, unable to bear\r\nthat his father should be thus exposed bareheaded to the storm which\r\nplayed upon the scene of carnage, stepped out of the ranks and taking\r\nhis own hat from his head, placed it on that of his father. It was the\r\nwork of an instant, and not a syllable escaped the lips of the agitated\r\nyoung man.[340]\r\n\r\nLord Kilmarnock was carried from the moor, which already, to use the\r\nwords of an eyewitness among the Government troops, \"was covered with\r\nblood; the men, what with killing the enemy, dabbling their feet in the\r\nblood, and splashing it about one another, looked like so many\r\nbutchers.\"[341] Never, did even their enemies declare, was a field of\r\nbattle bestrewn with a finer, perhaps with a nobler race. \"Every body\r\nallowed,\" writes one of Cumberland's officers, \"that men of a larger\r\nsize, larger limbs, and better proportioned, could not be found.\" The\r\nflower of their unhappy country; hundreds of these had not yet been\r\nblessed with the repose of death, but were left to languish in agony\r\nuntil the next day, when they were butchered by the orders of\r\nCumberland. One of them, John Alexander Fraser, in the Master of Lovat's\r\nregiment, was rescued by Lord Boyd from destruction. A soldier had\r\nstruck him with the butt of his musket, intending, according to the\r\norders given, to beat out his brains. The poor wretch, his nose and\r\ncheek-bone broken, and one of his eyes pierced, still breathed when this\r\nyoung nobleman passed him. He observed the poor creature, and ordered\r\nhis servants to carry him to a neighbouring kiln, where, in time, his\r\nwounds were cured. \"He lived,\" observes Mr. Chambers, \"many years\r\nafterwards, a dismal memorial of the cruelties of Culloden.\"[342]\r\n\r\nAccording to one account, Lord Kilmarnock owed his escape from the field\r\nof battle with his life to the brave and generous Lord Ancrum, who\r\ndelivered him to the Duke of Cumberland; and the same narrative adds,\r\nthat the Duke issued orders that no one should mention the Earl's\r\nimprisonment to his son, but considerately imparted the intelligence to\r\nthe young man himself. It is only fair to mention this redeeming trait\r\nin a man who had so many awful, and almost inexpiable sins to answer for\r\nat the last day, when not our professions of kindness, but our acts of\r\nmercy or of wrong will be placed before a solemn and final account.\r\n\r\nAfter his surrender at Culloden, the Earl of Kilmarnock was conveyed to\r\nLondon. That metropolis, in some of its most attractive features, was\r\nwell known to him: he had frequently resided there for several months\r\nduring the year, and had associated with the friends of government who\r\nwere near the court. He was now to view it under a very different\r\naspect; and during the period which elapsed between his surrender and\r\nhis trial, he had ample time to weigh the respective value of that\r\nsociety which had formerly so much delighted him, and in which, it is\r\nsaid he \"had affected to talk freely of religion;\" and of those great\r\ntruths which were now his only source of support.\r\n\r\nWhatever may have been his early errors, the remaining days of Lord\r\nKilmarnock were characterized by gentleness to those who were placed in\r\nauthority over him; forbearance to those who slandered him, and\r\nsubmission to God. Unable to conquer a natural intense love of life, he\r\nassumed no pretended intrepidity:[343] yet manifested a still greater\r\nconcern for his character, than for his fate. Society in general, as\r\nwell as the annalists of the times, mourned for him, and with him; and\r\nmany who beheld his doom, would have sacrificed much of their own\r\npersonal safety to avert the close of that tragic scene. But these were\r\nnot times when the generous might venture to interfere with\r\nsecurity.[344]\r\n\r\nTwo noblemen, differing greatly in character from Lord Kilmarnock,\r\nshared his imprisonment: Arthur, sixth Earl of Balmerinoch, or, as it is\r\nusually spelled Balmerino, (pronounced Balmerino), and George, Earl of\r\nCromartie.\r\n\r\nOf these individuals, Lord Balmerino, although an uncultured soldier,\r\nhas excited by far the greatest interest. He was descended, like most\r\nof his associates from an ancient family. It was of German origin,[345]\r\nfirst known in Scotland in the reign of Robert Bruce, to whose sister, a\r\nGerman Knight, sirnamed Elphingston, or Elphinstone, was married. Such\r\nwas the esteem in which Robert Bruce held his foreign brother-in-law,\r\nthat he gave him lands in Midlothian, which still bear the name of\r\nElphinstone.[346] Hence was he called Elphinstone of that Ilk--a mode of\r\nexpression employed in Scotland to prevent the repetition of the same\r\nname. In process of time certain estates which a descendant of the\r\nGerman Knight acquired at Arthbeg, in Stirlingshire, were also endowed\r\nwith that surname; and, during several centuries, the martial and hardy\r\nrace to whom those lands belonged continued in the same sphere, that of\r\nprivate gentlemen, chiefs of the House of Elphinstone. They were\r\nremarkable, in successive generations, for that bold and manly character\r\nwhich eventually distinguished their ill-fated descendant, Arthur\r\nBalmerino, and which, in time, extorted applause from the most\r\nprejudiced politicians of the opposite party. Alexander Elphinstone, in\r\nthe reign of David the Second, might have emulated the supposed deeds of\r\nGuy Earl of Warwick; he rivalled him in gigantic figure, in immense\r\nstrength, and knightly prowess. His disposition was not only martial,\r\nbut chivalric; for, conscious of extraordinary power, \"he was more\r\nable,\" says a writer of the last century, \"to overlook an affront, than\r\nmen less capable of resenting it.\" His son, inferior in bodily strength,\r\nequalled him in military exploits, which distinguished indeed a\r\nsuccession of the Elphinstones of that Ilk.[347] At Flodden, John\r\nElphinstone, who was created a Lord of Parliament by James the Fourth,\r\nwas killed by the side of his royal master, and being not unlike to that\r\nmonarch in face and figure, his body was carried to Berwick by the\r\nEnglish, who mistook it for that of the King.[348] In the reign of James\r\nthe Sixth, James, the second son of the third Lord Elphinstone, was\r\ncreated a Baron by the name and title of Lord Balmerino. He rose to high\r\nhonours in the State; but the first disgrace that befell the family\r\noccurred in this reign. This was the marriage of John, the second Lord\r\nBalmerino, to Jane Ker, sister of the infamous Ker, Earl of Somerset,\r\nand favourite of James the Sixth, who, for his sake, denounced a curse\r\non his posterity, which seems, says the writer before quoted, \"to have\r\nfollowed them and the nation ever since.\"\r\n\r\nLike most of the noble families in Scotland, the house of Balmerino\r\nbecame impoverished during the civil wars; and when the father of Arthur\r\nElphinstone succeeded to his title, he found his estates wofully\r\ndiminished. He was, however, one of those men who were capable, by\r\nability and prudence, of redeeming the fortunes of his family.\r\nCircumstances were, indeed, adverse to the prosperity of any whose\r\nloyalty to the Stuarts was suspected. Lord Balmerino was prudent, but he\r\nwas sincere. He was \"a man of excellent parts, improved by reading,\r\nbeing, perhaps, one of the very best lawyers in the kingdom, and very\r\nexpert in the Scottish constitution; he reasoned much and pertinently in\r\nParliament, and testifying, on all occasions, an unshaken loyalty to his\r\nPrince, and zealous affection to his country, he gained the esteem and\r\nlove of all good men.\"\r\n\r\nSuch was the father, of whom this noble character was drawn, to whom\r\nArthur, Lord Balmerino, owed his being. Such was the man whom it would\r\nhave been the wiser policy of the British Ministry to have conciliated,\r\non the accession of George the First, but whose son they drove into an\r\nact of imprudence by their distrust and injustice.\r\n\r\nThe first wife of John, fourth Lord Balmerino, was the daughter of Hugh,\r\nEarl of Eglintoun, and, consequently, she was connected with some of the\r\nmost strenuous supporters of the Stuart cause in the kingdom of\r\nScotland. By her he had two sons, Hugh, who was killed in 1708, at the\r\nsiege of Lisle, and James, who was educated to the profession of the\r\nlaw. Upon the death of this lady, Lord Balmerino married Anne, daughter\r\nof Ross, the last Archbishop of St. Andrews, and by her had two sons:\r\nArthur, who became eventually Lord Balmerino, and Alexander, who died in\r\n1733, unmarried; and a daughter, Anne, who died also unmarried. The\r\nsubject of this memoir may, therefore, be deemed the last of the House\r\nof Balmerino.[349]\r\n\r\nArthur Elphinstone was born in the year 1688. He had, until late in\r\nlife, no expectation of succeeding to the title of his father after the\r\ndeath of Hugh, there being still an elder brother, James. The\r\ncharacteristics of all this branch of the Elphinstone family appear\r\nalmost invariably to have been those of honour and justice, and James\r\nresembled his father in the integrity of his principles. The following\r\ncharacter is drawn of him by a contemporary writer: \"He was rather a\r\nsolid pleader than a refined orator; but he understood the law so well,\r\nand preserved the chastity of his character so tenderly, by avoiding\r\nbeing concerned in any scandalous actions, that he was listened to with\r\ngreat attention by the bench, at a time when it was filled by the most\r\neminent lawyers that ever appeared in Scotland.\"\r\n\r\nThe abilities of this able and conscientious man soon raised him to the\r\nbench, where he discharged his duties with that high and nice sense of\r\nintegrity which can only be described by the word honour. He never mixed\r\nparty-spirit with his judgments: he lent himself to no ministerial\r\npurposes. The dignity of the judge was preserved in his manly and\r\ncourageous character: and such was his application to business, that his\r\ncourt was thronged with practitioners when those of other judges were\r\nnearly deserted.\r\n\r\nArthur, his younger brother, possessed not his application, but\r\ndisplayed much, nevertheless, of the natural ability of his family. \"He\r\nwas not much acquainted with books; and though he was rich in repartee,\r\nyet he never affected to reason.\" Such is the remark of a contemporary\r\nwriter. Yet who might not envy the clear, undisturbed intellect which\r\nshowed him, in a moment of peculiar temptation, the value of plain\r\ndealing, and the inestimable price of a good conscience?\r\n\r\nSome members of a family seem fated to suffer for the others. Arthur\r\nElphinstone was educated in the principles which brought him to the\r\nscaffold: they were those of his father and brother, who were both\r\nfortunate enough to preserve them in their own breasts, and yet not to\r\nencounter trouble on that account. And, during the reign of Queen Anne\r\nthe family appear to have been deemed so well affected, as to procure\r\nthem promotion, not only in civil but military service. When very young,\r\nArthur Elphinstone obtained the command of a company of foot in Lord\r\nShannon's regiment, on the accession of George the First. His real\r\nopinions were, however, manifested by his resignation of his commission;\r\nand by his joining the standard of Lord Mar, under whom he commanded a\r\ncompany, and served in the battle of Sherriff Muir. By throwing up his\r\ncommission, he escaped being punished as a deserter, and was allowed to\r\nretire to the Continent. According to some accounts, he went first to\r\nDenmark; by others it is said, that he entered at once into the French\r\nservice. He remained, at all events, twenty years in exile from his\r\nfamily; but in 1733, an event occurred, which greatly increased the\r\nnatural desire which his father, declining in strength, had long\r\ncherished of again beholding his son. Alexander Elphinstone, the younger\r\nbrother of Arthur, died at Leith, two years before the Insurrection\r\nbroke out. This young man had had the misfortune in 1730, to fight a\r\nduel, shortly after which his adversary, Lieutenant Swift, had died of\r\nhis wounds. The combat took place on the Links of Leith; the affair was\r\nnotorious, and Alexander had been threatened with a prosecution, which\r\nwas not, however, put into execution.\r\n\r\nThis painful circumstance, coupled with Alexander Elphinstone's death,\r\nmay have naturally added to the wish which Lord Balmerino entertained,\r\nto rescue his exiled son from the sentence of outlawry under which he\r\nstood, and to restore him again to his home. Probably the desire of\r\nperpetuating honours which had been gained by legitimate exertions, may\r\nhave been contemplated by the aged nobleman when he revolved in his mind\r\nhow he could compass the safe return of his younger, and surviving son,\r\nto Scotland. James, the heir to the title, great as was the lustre which\r\nhis abilities and integrity shed upon it, was not likely to perpetuate\r\nmore honours, having no children by his wife Elizabeth Carnegie,\r\ndaughter of David, fourth Earl of Northesk.\r\n\r\nIt is one of the innumerable instances of human short-sightedness, that\r\nthe very recall of Arthur Elphinstone to Scotland was the cause of the\r\nextinction of family honours, and of that line in which they rested.\r\nAccording to some accounts, he remained abroad until the general Act of\r\nIndemnity, from which he was not excepted, took effect:[350] but by\r\nothers it is stated, that his father, having made a strong application\r\nto Government, obtained a free pardon for his son. If such were the\r\ncase, there seems a degree of ingratitude in again joining the enemies\r\nof Government, which one can scarcely reconcile with the generous\r\ncharacter of this brave man.\r\n\r\nHe was in Switzerland when he received a summons to return to his native\r\ncountry. His conduct upon the arrival of this intelligence was honest\r\nand candid towards him, to whom, according to his notions, he owed\r\nallegiance. He wrote to the Chevalier (St. George) and laid open the\r\ncircumstances of the case before him; stating that he should not accept\r\nthe proffered pardon without his permission. James answered this\r\nexplanation with his own hand; and not only gave Arthur Elphinstone\r\npermission to return to Scotland, but informed him that he had ordered\r\nhis banker at Paris to pay his travelling expenses. Thus authorized,\r\nArthur returned home, welcomed by his aged father with a satisfaction\r\nwhich happily was not destined to be alloyed by any adverse\r\ncircumstances during the lifetime of the venerable nobleman.\r\n\r\nThus was this ill-fated man restored to that land which probably,\r\nalthough long severed from its glens and mountains, he had not ceased to\r\nlove. He was now of middle age, being in his forty-fifth year; but his\r\ndisposition, in spite of his long residence among foreigners, was still\r\nthoroughly Scotch. He was as undaunted by danger as any of his valiant\r\nancestors had been, consequently he had no need to have recourse to\r\nguile; in short, falsehood would have been impossible to that frank\r\nnature. He was blunt in speech, but endowed with the kindest heart that\r\never throbbed in the dungeons of that grim fortress in which his manly\r\ncareer was closed. He had not, however, the prudence which is\r\ncharacteristic of his countrymen: and which, once well understood, is as\r\ndistinct from selfishness and craft as their martial vehemence has\r\ngenerally been from cruelty. A service in foreign campaigns had not\r\nlessened his ideas of honour; which were perhaps more truly cherished\r\namong military men on the Continent, than at that period in England. Few\r\nBritish troops, for example, ever proved themselves more worthy of the\r\nname of soldiers than the Hessians who served in Scotland in 1745. To\r\nthe fine and soldierly attributes of Lord Balmerino, to an intrepidity\r\nalmost amounting to indifference, to a warm and generous heart, were\r\nunited that ready and careless humour which accord so well with the\r\nloftier qualities of the mind, and certainly rather enhance, than\r\ndetract from the charm of graver attributes of character.\r\n\r\nIn appearance, Lord Balmerino was strongly contrasted with the\r\nfellow-sufferer with whom his name is indelibly associated. \"His\r\nperson,\" writes a contemporary, \"was very plain, his shape clumsy, but\r\nhis make strong: and he had no marks of the polite gentleman about him.\r\nHe was illiterate in respect of his birth; but rather from a total want\r\nof application to letters, than want of ability.\"[351] His manners are\r\nsaid to have been natural, if not courtly; his countenance only inferior\r\nin its ungainliness to that of Lovat, but, expressing, we may suppose, a\r\nvery different temper of mind, harsh as were its features, it\r\ncaptivated, as well as that of the handsome Kilmarnock, female\r\nregard.[352]\r\n\r\nAccording to some statements, Lord Balmerino married in 1711, before the\r\nfirst Insurrection;[353] but no distinct allusion to a connection of so\r\nearly a period is to be found in the authenticated narratives of his\r\nlife. It was not, it seems evident, until after his return from\r\nSwitzerland, that he married Margaret, daughter of Captain\r\nChalmers--\"the pretty Peggy,\" who was at once his solace and his sorrow\r\nwhen in the Tower of London. In 1736, the father, whom he had returned\r\nto cheer in his decline, died at his house in Leith, and was buried at\r\nthe family seat at Restalrig in Leith. His son James, succeeded to the\r\ntitle.[354]\r\n\r\nWhen the intelligence arrived, that Charles Edward had landed in\r\nScotland, Arthur Elphinstone hastened to the standard of the Prince. On\r\nthe thirty-first of October, 1745, he marched from Edinburgh, on the\r\nexpedition to England, having the command of a troop of horse, not\r\ncomplete, in number about forty.[355] His military talents were well\r\nknown, for he had distinguished himself in several campaigns in\r\nFlanders.[356] But, as he took into the field only his menial servants,\r\nno very important posts were entrusted to him; and his career appears\r\nnot to have been signalized by any remarkable military exploits. In\r\nshort, it may be truly said of him as of Dr. Donne by Izaak Walton, that\r\n\"nothing in his life became him like the leaving it.\"\r\n\r\nAfter joining the insurgent army, Lord Balmerino engaged in all the\r\nvarious movements of that enterprise. After the siege of Carlisle he\r\nentered that city at the head of his troop, with pipes playing, and\r\ncolours flying, having been at twelve miles' distance when the town was\r\ntaken; he then proceeded in the fatal expedition to Derby, and returned\r\na second time to Carlisle, preceding in his march the main body of the\r\narmy towards Scotland. He was present at the battle of Falkirk, but did\r\nnot engage in it: some of the cavalry having been kept as a _corps de\r\nreserve_ in that engagement. His participation in that day's victory\r\nwas, however, afterwards imputed to him as an act of rebellion, although\r\nhe was merely drawn up in a field near the field of battle, in company\r\nwith Lord Kilmarnock and Lord Pitsligo. The body which he commanded,\r\nwent by the name of Arthur Elphinstone's Life Guards.[357]\r\n\r\nA few weeks before the battle of Culloden, the elder brother of Arthur\r\nElphinstone, James Lord Balmerino, died, leaving the title which he had\r\nenjoyed for so short a period, to the brother, who was then engaged in\r\nso perilous a course. This accession of honour brought with it little\r\nincrease of fortune, but rather the responsibility of succeeding to\r\nencumbered estates. Of these most had, indeed, passed into other\r\nfamilies. To the first Lord Balmerino charters of numerous lands and\r\nbaronies had been given; Barntoun, Barrie, Balumby, Innerpeffer,\r\nBalgregie, Balmerino, Dingwall, &c., were among his possessions. In\r\n1605, the barony of Restalrig, in South Leith, was sold to Lord\r\nBalmerino by the noted and profligate Robert Logan, Baron of Restalrig,\r\nto whose family that now valuable property, including the grounds lying\r\nnear the river, had belonged, until the days of the Queen Regent, Mary.\r\nThis estate, on which Lord Balmerino's father resided, appears to have\r\nbeen almost the only vestige of the former opulence of this branch of\r\nthe Elphinstone family.[358] His embarrassed circumstances are deemed by\r\nsome writers to have had a considerable share in deciding Lord Balmerino\r\nto join in a contest in which he had so little to lose; but it appeared,\r\nin the hour of trial, that his principles of allegiance to the Stuarts\r\nhad been unaltered since the days of his youth, and that they were alone\r\nsufficient to account for the part which he adopted. At the battle of\r\nCulloden Lord Balmerino was made prisoner by the Grants, to whom, as one\r\nof the witnesses on his trial affirmed, he surrendered himself. He was\r\nconveyed to Castle Grant, and from thence to London, to the same dreary\r\nfortress in which Lord Kilmarnock was likewise immured. The fate of\r\nthese two unfortunate men, hitherto but little dependant on each other,\r\nwas henceforth associated, until the existence of both was closed on the\r\nscaffold.\r\n\r\nGeorge, the third Earl of Cromartie, was the only one of their\r\nfellow-prisoners who was arraigned and tried with Kilmarnock and\r\nBalmerino. He had taken even a more decided part in the insurrection\r\nthan Balmerino, having raised four hundred of his clan, who were with\r\nhim in the battle of Falkirk. His son, the young Lord Macleod, was also\r\nin the Jacobite army, and both father and son were surprised at\r\nDunrobin, by a party of the Earl of Sutherland's militia, on the\r\nfifteenth of April, and taken prisoners. Lord Cromartie had, as well as\r\nLords Kilmarnock and Balmerino, strong ties to life, strong claims upon\r\nhis reason to have withheld him from a hazardous participation in a\r\ncause of peril. He had been married more than twenty years to Isabel,\r\ndaughter of Sir William Gordon, and had by her a numerous family. For\r\nthis nobleman, a powerful interest was afterwards successfully exerted.\r\n\r\nThese three noblemen were brought to London early in June. They were\r\nshortly afterwards followed by about eight hundred companions in\r\nmisfortune. Of these, who arrived in the Thames on the twenty-first of\r\nJune, about two hundred were left at Tilbury Fort; while six hundred\r\nwere deposited in the various prisons of the metropolis. From henceforth\r\nscenes of distress, and even of horror, were daily presented to the\r\nprisoners. The Marquis of Tullibardine expired soon after his arrival at\r\nthe Tower; Lord Macleod, with happier fate, rejoined his father; Mr.\r\nMurray of Broughton, who was treated with a distinction, at that time,\r\nunexplicable, was also lodged in the same fortress. Those who were led\r\nto expect the severest measures, might envy the calm departure of the\r\ngood old Marquis of Tullibardine; but all hearts bled when the gallant\r\nColonel Townley, a Roman Catholic gentleman of distinction, was dragged\r\non a sledge, along with other prisoners, to Kennington, his arms\r\npinioned; insulted by a brutal multitude, and there hanged. The horrid\r\nbarbarities of this sentence being fulfilled on his body, which was\r\nstill breathing, the hangman preparing to take out the heart and bowels,\r\nstruck it several times on the chest, before life (and perhaps\r\nconsciousness) was wholly extinct.\r\n\r\nDay after day, the awful tragedies were repeated, exceeding any similar\r\ndisplays of power since the days of the Tudors. Each of these _martyrs_,\r\nas the voice of their own party pronounced them, in their last moments\r\ndeclared, that \"they died in a just cause--that they did not repent of\r\nwhat they had done--that they doubted not their deaths would be\r\navenged.\" When, after nine executions had taken place in one morning,\r\nthe heart of the last sufferer was thrown into the fire, a savage shout\r\nfrom the infuriated multitude followed the words \"God save King George!\"\r\nThe unfortunate man who had just perished was a young gentleman, named\r\nDawson, a graduate of St. John's College, Cambridge. He had for some\r\ntime been engaged to a young lady of good family, and great interest had\r\nbeen made to procure his pardon. The lovers were sanguine in their\r\nexpectations, and the day of his release was to have been that of their\r\nmarriage.\r\n\r\nWhen all hope was at an end, the young lady, not deterred by the\r\nremonstrances of her kindred, resolved upon following Mr. Dawson to the\r\nplace of execution. Her intention was at length acceded to: she drove in\r\na hackney-coach after the sledges, accompanied by a relative, and by one\r\nfemale friend. As the shout of brutal joy succeeded the silence of the\r\nsolemn scene, the words \"My love,--I follow thee,--I follow thee!\"\r\nburst from the lips of the broken-hearted girl. She fell on the neck of\r\nher companion, and, whilst she uttered these words, \"Sweet\r\nJesus!--receive our souls together!\" expired.[359] Recitals of these\r\ndomestic tragedies, proofs of the unrelenting spirit of government,\r\ntended to break the firmness of some of those who survived.\r\n\r\nLord Cromartie sank into dejection; Kilmarnock's fine and gentle nature\r\nwas gradually purified for heaven. Balmerino rose to heroism.\r\n\r\nThe prisons were crowded with captives; the noblemen alone were\r\ncommitted to the Tower; even two of the Scottish chiefs were sent to\r\nNewgate; the officers were committed to the new gaol, Southwark; the\r\ncommon men to the Marshalsea. Meantime, strong and prompt measures were\r\ndetermined upon by Government.\r\n\r\nBills of indictment for high treason were found against Lord Kilmarnock,\r\nthe Earl of Cromartie, and the Lord Balmerino, by the grand jury of the\r\ncounty of Surrey: a writ of certiorari was issued for removing the\r\nindictments into the House of Peers, on the twenty-sixth of June, and\r\ntheir trial was appointed to take place on the twenty-eighth of July\r\nfollowing. Westminster Hall was accordingly prepared for the trials, and\r\na high steward appointed in the person of the justly celebrated Lord\r\nHardwicke.\r\n\r\nOn the petition of Lord Kilmarnock, Mr. George Ross was engaged as his\r\nsolicitor, with permission to have free access to him at all times. On\r\nthe appointed day the trials commenced. Westminster Hall was fitted up\r\nwith unprecedented magnificence; and tickets were issued by the Lord\r\nChamberlain to the Peers, to give access to their friends. At eight\r\no'clock in the morning, the Judges in their robes, with the\r\nGarter-King-at-Arms, the Usher of the Black Rod, and the\r\nSerjeant-at-Arms waited on the Lord High Steward at his house in Ormond\r\nStreet: Garter in his coat of the king's arms, and Black Rod, having the\r\nwhite staff attended them. After a short interval the procession to\r\nWestminster Hall began: Lord Hardwicke, designated during the term of\r\nthe trial as \"his Grace,\" came forth to his coach, his train borne, and\r\nfollowed by the chief judges and judges. His coach was preceded by his\r\nGrace's twenty gentlemen, uncovered, in five coaches two and two; by the\r\nSerjeant-at-Arms, and the Black Rod. The heralds occupied the back seats\r\nof his Grace's coach; the judges in their coaches followed. As the\r\nprocession entered the Palace-yard, the soldiers rested their muskets\r\nand the drums beat, as to the Royal Family.\r\n\r\nMeantime, the Peers in their robes were assembled; the Lord High Steward\r\nhaving passed to the House, through the Painted Chamber, prayers were\r\nread; and the peers were called over by Garter-King-at-Arms. The Lord\r\nSteward, followed first by his four gentlemen attendants, two and two;\r\nand afterwards by the clerks of the House of Lords, and the clerks of\r\nthe Crown; by the Peers, and the Peers' sons, proceeded to Westminster\r\nHall, the Lord Steward being alone uncovered, and his train borne by a\r\npage.\r\n\r\nProclamation for silence having been made by the Lord Steward's\r\nserjeant-at-arms, the commission was read, the lords standing up,\r\nuncovered. Then his Grace, making obeisance to the lords, reseated\r\nhimself; and Garter, and the Black Rod, with their reverences, jointly\r\npresented the white staff, on their knees, to his Grace. Thus fully\r\ninvested with his office, the Lord Steward took his staff in his hand\r\nand descended from the woolsack to a chair prepared for him on an ascent\r\nbefore the throne.\r\n\r\nThe three lords had been brought during this time from the Tower. The\r\nEarl of Kilmarnock was conveyed in Lord Cornwallis's coach, attended by\r\nGeneral Williamson, Deputy Governor of the Tower; the Earl of Cromartie,\r\nin General Williamson's coach, attended by Captain Marshal; and Lord\r\nBalmerino in the third coach, attended by Mr. Fowler, Gentleman Gaoler,\r\nwho had the axe covered by his side. A strong body of soldiers escorted\r\nthese carriages.\r\n\r\nThe three lords being conducted into the Hall, proclamation was made by\r\nthe Serjeant-at-Arms that the Lieutenant of the Tower should bring his\r\nprisoners to the bar, the proclamation being made in this form:--\"Oyez,\r\noyez, oyez, Lieutenant of the Tower of London, bring forward your\r\nprisoners, William Earl of Kilmarnock, George Earl of Cromartie, and\r\nArthur Lord Balmerino, together with the copies of their respective\r\ncommitments, pursuant to the order of the House of Lords.\"\r\n\r\nThen the lords were led to the bar of the House by the\r\nLieutenant-Governor, the axe being carried before them with its edge\r\nturned from them. The prisoners, when they approached the bar, made\r\nthree reverences, and fell upon their knees. Then said the Lord High\r\nSteward your \"lordships may arise;\" upon which the three lords arose and\r\nbowed to his Grace the High Steward, and to the House, which compliment\r\nwas returned by the Lord High Steward, and by the Peers.\r\n\r\nThus began the trial; \"the greatest, and the most melancholy scene,\"\r\nwrote Horace Walpole to Sir Horace Mann, \"that I ever saw. As it was the\r\nmost interesting sight, it was the most solemn and fine; a coronation is\r\nbut a puppet show, and all the splendour of it idle; but this sight at\r\nonce feasted one's eyes, and engaged one's passions;\"--a signal avowal\r\nfor one whom a long continuance in the world's business, and, perhaps,\r\nworse, its pleasures, had hardened. A hundred and thirty-nine lords were\r\npresent, making a noble sight on their benches, and assisting at a\r\nceremony which is said to have been conducted with the most awful\r\nsolemnity and decency throughout, with one or two exceptions.[360]\r\n\r\nThe Lord Chancellor Hardwicke, who presided on this occasion, has been\r\njustly deemed one of the brightest ornaments of the woolsack. The son of\r\nan attorney at Dover, as Philip Yorke, he had risen to the highest\r\noffices of the law, by his immense acquirements, and his incomparable\r\npowers of illustration and arrangement. By his marriage with a niece of\r\nthe celebrated Lord Somers, he strengthened his political interest,\r\nwhich, however, it required few adventitious circumstances to secure.\r\nThree great men have expressed their admiration of Lord Hardwicke almost\r\nin similar terms: Lord Mansfield, Burke, and Wilkes. \"When his lordship\r\npronounced his decrees, wisdom herself might be supposed to speak.\"[361]\r\nIn manner, he was usually considered to be dignified, impressive, and\r\nunruffled; and his intentions were allowed to be as pure and elevated,\r\nas his views were patriotic.\r\n\r\nOn this eventful day, since we cannot reject the testimony of an\r\neye-witness of discernment, we must believe that party spirit, which had\r\nusually so little influence over his sense of justice, swayed the\r\nprepossessions of Lord Hardwicke. At all events, it affected his\r\ntreatment of the unhappy men to whom he displayed a petulance wholly\r\nderogatory to his character as a judge, and discreditable to his\r\nfeelings as a man. \"Instead of keeping up the humane dignity of the law\r\nof England, whose character is to point out any favour to the criminal,\r\nhe crossed them, and almost scolded at any offer they made towards\r\ndefence.\" Such is the remark of Horace Walpole.[362] Comely in person,\r\nand possessing a fine voice, Lord Hardwicke had every opportunity, on\r\nthis occasion, of a graceful display of dignity and courtesy; yet his\r\ndeportment, usually so calm and lofty, was obsequious, \"curiously\r\nsearching for occasion to bow to the minister, and, consequently,\r\napplying to the other ministers, in a manner, for their orders;--not\r\neven ready at the ceremonial.\" Notwithstanding, Lord Hardwicke, on his\r\ndeath-bed, could with confidence declare \"that he had never wronged any\r\nman.\" The unhappy Jacobites seem, indeed, to have been considered\r\nexceptions to all the common rules of clemency. None of the Royal\r\nFamily were present at the trial, from a proper regard for the feelings\r\nof the prisoners, and also, perhaps, from a nice sense of the\r\npeculiarity of their own condition.\r\n\r\nAfter the warrants to the Lieutenant of the Tower were read, the Lord\r\nHigh Steward addressed the prisoners, telling them that although their\r\ncrimes were of the most heinous nature, they were still open to such\r\ndefences as circumstances, and the rules of law and justice would allow.\r\nThe indictments for high treason were then read: to these, Lords\r\nKilmarnock and Cromartie pleaded guilty; but when the question was put\r\nto Lord Balmerino, he demanded boldly, but respectfully to be heard,\r\nobjecting to two clauses in the indictment, in which he was styled\r\n\"Arthur Lord Balmerino, of the town of Carlisle,\" and also charging him\r\nwith being at the taking of Carlisle, when he could prove \"that he was\r\nnot within twelve miles of it.\" Not insisting upon these objections, and\r\nthe question being again put to him, he then pleaded, 'not guilty.' Lord\r\nKilmarnock and Lord Cromartie were removed from the bar, and the trial\r\nof Balmerino began. It was prefaced by addresses from Sir Richard Loyd,\r\nking's counsel, and from Mr. Serjeant Skinner, who made, what was justly\r\nconsidered by H. Walpole, \"the most absurd speech imaginable,\" calling\r\n\"Rebellion, surely the sin of witchcraft,\" and applying to the Duke of\r\nCumberland the unfortunate appellation of \"Scipio.\"[363] The Attorney\r\nGeneral followed, and witnesses were afterwards examined, who fully\r\nproved, though accused by Balmerino of some inconsistencies, his acts of\r\nadherence to the Chevalier; his being present in towns where James\r\nStuart was proclaimed King; his wearing the regimentals of Prince\r\nCharles's body guards; his marching into Carlisle at the head of his\r\ntroops, with a white cockade in his cap; his presence at the battle of\r\nFalkirk, in a field with Lords Kilmarnock and Pitsligo, who were at the\r\nhead of a corps of reserve. Six witnesses were examined, but there was\r\nno cross-examination, except such as Balmerino himself attempted. The\r\nwitnesses were chiefly men who had served in the same cause for which\r\nthe brave Balmerino was soon to suffer. After they had delivered their\r\ntestimony, the \"old hero,\" as he was well styled, shook hands cordially\r\nwith them. In one or two instances, as far as can be judged by the\r\nanswers, the evidence seems to have been given with reluctance. Lord\r\nBalmerino being asked if he had any thing to offer in his defence, he\r\nobserved that none of the witnesses had agreed upon the same day as that\r\nwhich was named in the indictment for being at Carlisle; and objected to\r\nthe indictment, that he was not at the taking of Carlisle as therein\r\nspecified. His objections were taken into consideration; the Lords\r\nretired to their chamber, and there consulted the judges whether it be\r\nnecessary that an overt act of high treason should be proved to have\r\nbeen committed on the particular day named in the indictment.\r\n\r\nThe answer being in the negative, every hope of acquittal was\r\nannihilated for Balmerino. He gave up every further defence, and\r\napologised with his usual blunt courtesy for giving their Lordships so\r\nmuch trouble: he said that his objections had been the result of advice\r\ngiven by Mr. Ross, his solicitor, who had laid the case before counsel.\r\nThe question was then put by the Lord High Steward, standing up,\r\nuncovered, to the Lords, beginning with the youngest peer, Lord Herbert\r\nof Cherbury; \"whether Arthur Lord Balmerino were guilty of high treason,\r\nor not guilty?\" An unanimous reply was uttered by all those who were\r\npresent; \"guilty upon my honour.\" Lord Balmerino, who had retired while\r\nthe question was put, was then brought back to the bar to hear the\r\ndecision of the Lords. It was received with the intrepidity which had,\r\nall throughout the trial, characterised the soldier and the man. During\r\nthe intervals of form, his natural playfulness and humour appeared, and\r\nthe kindness of his disposition was manifested. A little boy being in\r\nthe course of the trial near him, but not tall enough to see, he took\r\nhim up, made room for the child, and placed him near himself. The axe\r\ninspired him with no associations of fear. He played upon it, while\r\ntalking, with his fingers, and some one coming up to listen to what he\r\nwas saying, he held it up like a fan between his face and that of the\r\ngentleman-gaoler, to the great amusement of all beholders. And this\r\ncarelessness of the emblem of death was but a prelude to the calmness\r\nwith which he met his fate. \"All he troubled himself about,\" as a writer\r\nof the time observed, \"was to end as he begun, and to let his sun set\r\nwith as _full_ and _fair_ a light as it was possible.\"[364] During the\r\ntime that the Lords were withdrawn, the Solicitor-General Murray, and\r\nbrother of Murray of Broughton, addressed Balmerino, asking him \"how he\r\ncould give the Lords so much trouble,\" when he had been told by his\r\nsolicitor that the plea could be of no use to him? The defection and\r\nperfidy of Murray of Broughton were now generally known; and the\r\nofficious insolence of his inquiry was both revolting and indiscreet.\r\nBalmerino asked who this person was, and being told, exclaimed, \"Oh! Mr.\r\nMurray, I am extremely glad to see you. I have been with several of your\r\nrelations, the poor lady, your mother, was of great use to us at\r\nPerth.\"[365] An admirable and well-merited rebuke. He afterwards\r\ndeclared humorously that one of his reasons for not pleading guilty was,\r\n\"that so many fine ladies might not be disappointed of their show.\"\r\n\r\nBesides the interest which at such a moment the grave dignity of\r\nKilmarnock, contrasted with the lofty indifference of Balmerino, might\r\nexcite, there was some diversion among the Peers, owing to the\r\neccentricity of several of their body. Of these, one, Lord Windsor,\r\naffectedly said when asked for his vote, \"I am sorry I must say, _guilty\r\nupon my honour_.\" Another nobleman, Lord Stamford, refused to answer to\r\nthe name of Henry, having been christened Harry. \"What a great way of\r\nthinking,\" remarks Horace Walpole, \"on such an occasion.\" Lord Foley\r\nwithdrew, as being a well-wisher to poor Balmerino; Lord Stair on the\r\nplea of kindred--\"uncle,\" as Horace Walpole sneeringly remarks, to his\r\ngreat-grandfather; and the Earl of Moray on account of his relationship\r\nto Balmerino, his mother, Jane Elphinstone, being sister to that\r\nnobleman.[366]\r\n\r\nBut the greatest source of amusement to all who were present was the\r\ncelebrated Audrey, or to speak in more polite phrase, Ethelreda, Lady\r\nTownshend, the wife of Charles, third Viscount Townshend, and the\r\nmother of the celebrated wit, Charles Townshend. Lady Townshend was\r\nrenowned for her epigrams, to which, perhaps, in this case, her being\r\nseparated from her husband gave additional point. When she heard her\r\nhusband vote, \"_guilty upon my honour_,\" she remarked, \"I always knew\r\n_my_ Lord was _guilty_, but I never knew that he would own it upon his\r\n_honour_.\" Her sarcastic humour was often exhibited at the expense of\r\nfriend or foe. When some one related that Whitfield had recanted, \"No,\r\nmadam,\" she replied, \"he has only _canted_.\" And when Lord Bath ventured\r\nto complain to this audacious leader of fashion, that he had a pain in\r\nhis side, she cried out, \"Oh! that cannot be, you have _no side_.\"\r\n\r\nA touch of feminine feeling softened the harshness of the professed wit,\r\nalways a dangerous, and scarcely ever a pleasing character in woman. As\r\nLady Townshend gazed on the prisoners at the bar, and saw the elegant\r\nand melancholy aspect of Lord Kilmarnock, the heart that was not wholly\r\nseared by a worldly career is said to have been deeply and seriously\r\ntouched by the graces of that incomparable person, and the mournful\r\ndignity of his manner. Perhaps, opposition to her husband, whose\r\ngrandfather was Minister to George the First, and whose mother was a\r\nWalpole, gave the additional luxury of partisanship; that passion which\r\nlasted even some weeks after the scene was closed; and when the\r\nfashionable world were left to enjoy, undisturbed by any fears of any\r\nfuture rebellion, all the dangerous attractions of the dissolute Court.\r\n\r\nThe first day's proceedings being at an end, the prisoners were\r\nremanded to the Tower. On the following morning the proceedings were\r\nresumed, and the Lords having assembled in the Painted Chamber, took\r\ntheir places in Westminster Hall. The three lords were then again\r\nbrought to the bar, again kneeled down, again were bidden to arise. The\r\nAttorney-General having prayed for judgment upon the prisoners, they\r\nwere desired by the Lord High Steward to say \"why judgment of death\r\nshould not be passed against them according to law.\"\r\n\r\nThe reply of Lord Kilmarnock is described as having been a \"very fine\r\nspeech, delivered in a very fine voice;\" his behaviour during the whole\r\nof the trial, a \"most just mixture between dignity and submission.\" Such\r\nis the avowal of one who could not be supposed very favourable to the\r\nparty; but whose better feelings were, for once, called into play during\r\nthis remarkable scene.[367]\r\n\r\nThe address of Lord Kilmarnock, however beautiful and touching in\r\nexpression, will not, however, satisfy those who look for consistency in\r\nthe most solemn moments of this chequered state of trial; but in\r\nperusing the summary of it, let it be remembered that he was a father;\r\nthe father of those who had already suffered deeply for his adherence to\r\nCharles Edward; that he was the husband of a lady who, whatever may have\r\nbeen their differences, was at that awful hour still fondly beloved;\r\nthat he dreaded penury for his children, an apprehension which those who\r\nremembered the fate of the Jacobites of 1715 might well recall; a dread,\r\naggravated by his rank; a dread, the bitterness of which is\r\nindescribable; the temptations it offers unspeakably great. These\r\nconsiderations, far stronger than the fear of death, actuated Lord\r\nKilmarnock. He arose, and a deep silence was procured, whilst he offered\r\nno justification of his conduct, \"which had been,\" he said, \"of too\r\nheinous a nature to be vindicated, and which any endeavour to excuse\r\nwould rather aggravate than diminish.\" He declared himself ready to\r\nsubmit to the sentence which he was conscious that he had deserved.\r\n\"Covered with confusion and grief, I throw myself at his Majesty's\r\nfeet.\"\r\n\r\nHe then appealed to the uniform honour of his life, previous to the\r\ninsurrection, in evidence of his principles. \"My sphere of action,\r\nindeed, was narrow; but as much as I could do in that sphere, it is well\r\nknown, I have always exerted myself to the utmost in every part of his\r\nMajesty's service I had an opportunity to act in, from my first\r\nappearance in the world, to the time I was drawn into the crime, for\r\nwhich I now appeal before your Lordships.\"\r\n\r\nHe referred to his conduct during the civil contest; to his endeavours\r\nto avert needless injury to his opponents; to his care of the prisoners,\r\na plea which he yet allowed to be no atonement for the \"blood he had\r\nbeen accessary to the spilling of. Neither,\" he said, \"do I plead it as\r\nsuch, as at all in defence of my crime.\"\r\n\r\n\"I have a son, my lords,\" he proceeded, \"who has the honour to carry his\r\nMajesty's commission; whose behaviour, I believe, will sufficiently\r\nevince, that he has been educated in the firmest revolution principles,\r\nand brought up with the warmest attachment to his Majesty's interests,\r\nand the highest zeal for his most sacred person.\r\n\r\n\"It was my chief care to instruct him in these principles from his\r\nearliest youth, and to confirm him, as he grew up, in the justice and\r\nnecessity of them to the good and welfare of the nation. And, I thank\r\nGod, I have succeeded;--for his father's example did not shake his\r\nloyalty; the ties of nature yielded to those of duty; he adhered to the\r\nprinciples of his family, and nobly exposed his life at the battle of\r\nCulloden, in defence of his King and the liberties of Great Britain, in\r\nwhich I, his unfortunate father, was in arms to destroy.\"\r\n\r\nLord Kilmarnock next alluded to the services of his father in 1715, when\r\nhis zeal and activity in the service of Government had caused his death:\r\n\"I had then,\" he added, \"the honour to serve under him.\"\r\n\r\nLord Kilmarnock proceeded to explain his own circumstances at the time\r\nof the insurrection: he declared that he was not one of those dangerous\r\npersons who could raise a number of men when they will, and command them\r\non any enterprise they will: \"my interests,\" he said, \"lie on the south\r\nside of the Forth, in the well inhabited, and well affected counties of\r\nKilmarnock and Falkirk, in the shires of Ayr and Stirling.\" His\r\ninfluence he declared to be very small.\r\n\r\nThis portion of his appeal was ill-advised; for it seems to have been\r\nthe policy of Government to have selected as objects of royal mercy\r\nthose who had most in their power, not the feeble and impoverished\r\nmembers of the Jacobite party. It has been shown what favour would have\r\nbeen manifested to the chief of the powerful clan Cameron, had he\r\ndeigned to receive it: and the event proved, that not the decayed\r\nbranches, but the vigorous shoots were spared. Lord Cromartie, who had\r\ntaken a far more signal part in the insurrection than either Kilmarnock\r\nor Balmerino, and whose resources were considerable, was eventually\r\npardoned, probably with the hope of conciliating a numerous clan.\r\n\r\nAfter appealing to his surrender in extenuation of his sentence, and\r\nbeseeching the intercession of the Lords with his Majesty, Lord\r\nKilmarnock concluded--\"It is by Britons only that I pray to be\r\nrecommended to a British monarch. But if justice allow not of mercy, my\r\nlords, I will lay down my life with patience and resignation; my last\r\nbreath shall be employed in the most fervent prayers for the\r\npreservation and prosperity of his Majesty, and to beg his forgiveness,\r\nand the forgiveness of my country.\" He concluded, amid the tears and\r\ncommiseration of a great majority of those who heard his address.\r\n\r\nThe Earl of Cromartie was then called upon to speak in arrest of\r\njudgment. His defence is said to have been a masterly piece of\r\neloquence. It ended with a pathetic appeal, which fell powerless on\r\nthose who heard him.[368]\r\n\r\n\"But, after all, if my safety shall be found inconsistent with that of\r\nthe public, and nothing but my blood be thought necessary to atone for\r\nmy unhappy crimes; if the sacrifice of my life, my fortune, and family,\r\nare judged indispensable for stopping the loud demands of public\r\njustice; if, notwithstanding all the allegations that can be urged in my\r\nfavour, the bitter cup is not to pass from me, not mine, but thy will, O\r\nGod, be done.\"[369]\r\n\r\nBalmerino then arose to answer the accustomed question. He produced a\r\npaper, which was read for him at the bar, by the clerk of the court. It\r\nwas a plea which had been sent by the House of Lords that morning to the\r\nprisoners, and which, it was hoped, would save all of these unfortunate\r\nmen. It contained an objection to the indictments, stating that the act\r\nfor regulating the trials of rebels, and empowering his Majesty to\r\nremove such as are taken in arms from one county to another, where they\r\nmight be tried by the common courts of peers, did not take effect till\r\nafter the facts, implying treason, had been committed by the\r\nprisoners.[370] The two Earls had not made use of this plea, but Lord\r\nBalmerino availed himself of it, and demanded counsel on it. Upon the\r\ntreatment which he then encountered, the following remark is made by one\r\nwho viewed the scene, and whose commiseration for the Jacobites forms\r\none of the few amiable traits of his character.[371]\r\n\r\n\"The High Steward,\" relates Horace Walpole, \"almost in a passion, told\r\nhim, that when he had been offered counsel, he did not accept it;--but\r\ndo think on the ridicule of sending them the plea, and then denying them\r\ncounsel on it.\"[372] A discussion among the Lords then took place; and\r\nthe Duke of Newcastle, who, as the same writer truly remarks, \"never\r\nlost an opportunity of being absurd,\" took it up as a ministerial point\r\n\"in defence of his creature, the Chancellor.\" Lord Granville, however,\r\nmoved, according to order, to return to the Chamber of Parliament, where\r\nthe Duke of Bedford and many others spoke warmly for their \"having\r\ncounsel,\" and that privilege was granted. \"I said _their_,\" observes\r\nWalpole, \"because the plea would have saved them all, and affected nine\r\nrebels who had been hanged that very morning.\"\r\n\r\nThe Lords having returned to the Hall, and the prisoners being again\r\ncalled to the bar, Lord Balmerino was desired to choose his counsel. He\r\nnamed Mr. Forester, and Mr. Wilbraham, the latter being a very able\r\nlawyer in the House of Commons. Lord Hardwicke is said to have remarked\r\nprivately, that Wilbraham, he was sure, \"would as soon be hanged as\r\nplead such a cause.\" But he was mistaken: the conclusion of the trial\r\nwas again deferred until the following day, Friday, August the first,\r\nwhen Mr. Wilbraham, accompanied by Mr. Forester, appeared in court as\r\ncounsel for the prisoners. Previously, however, to the proceedings of\r\nthe last day, Lord Balmerino was informed that his only hope was\r\nill-founded; the plea was deemed invalid by the counsel; and the straw\r\nwhich had, with the kindest and most laudable intentions, been thrown on\r\nthe stream to arrest his fate, was insufficient to save him. He bore\r\nthis disappointment with that fortitude which has raised the character\r\nof his countrymen: when he appeared on that last day, in Westminster\r\nHall, with his brother prisoners, he submitted, in the following brief\r\nand simple words, to his destiny. \"As your lordships have been pleased\r\nto allow me counsel, I have advised with them; and my counsel tell me,\r\nthere is nothing in that paper which I delivered in on Wednesday last,\r\nthat will be of any use to me; so I will not give your lordships any\r\nmore trouble.\"\r\n\r\nWhen again asked, according to the usual form, as well as the other\r\nprisoners, whether he had anything more to say in arrest of judgment,\r\nLord Balmerino replied; \"No, my Lords, I only desire to be heard for a\r\nmoment.\" Expressing his regret that he should have taken up so much of\r\ntheir lordships' time, he assured them that the plea had not been put in\r\nto gain time, but because he had believed there was something in the\r\nobjection that would do him good. He afterwards added these few words,\r\nwhich one might have wished unsaid: \"My lords, I acknowledge my crime,\r\nand I beg your lordships will intercede with his Majesty for me.\"\r\n\r\nThe Serjeant-at-Arms was then distinctly heard proclaiming silence; and\r\nthe Lord High Steward delivered what Horace Walpole has termed, \"his\r\nvery long, and very poor speech, with only one or two good passages in\r\nit.\" On this, there may be, doubtless, contending opinions. Those who\r\nlooked upon the prisoners, and saw men in the full vigour of life,\r\ncondemned to death, for acting upon acknowledged, though misapplied\r\nprinciples, could scarcely listen to that protracted harangue with an\r\nunbiassed judgment. The tenour of the Lord High Steward's address had,\r\nthroughout, one marked feature; it presented no hope of mercy; it left\r\nno apology nor plea upon which the unhappy prisoners might expect it. It\r\namplified every view of their crime, and pointed out, in strong and able\r\nlanguage, its effect upon every relation of society.\r\n\r\nIn conclusion, Lord Hardwicke said, \"I will add no more: it has been his\r\nMajesty's justice to bring your lordships to a legal trial; and it has\r\nbeen his wisdom to show, that as a small part of his national forces was\r\nsufficient to subdue the rebel army in the field, so the ordinary course\r\nof his law is strong enough to bring even their chiefs to justice.\r\n\r\n\"What remains for me, is a very painful, though a very necessary part.\r\nIt is to pronounce that sentence which the law has provided for crimes\r\nof this magnitude--a sentence full of horror! Such as the wisdom of our\r\nancestors has ordained, as one guard about the sacred person of the\r\nking, and as a fence about this excellent constitution, to be a terror\r\nto evil doers, and a security to them that do well.\"\r\n\r\nAnd then was heard, thrilling every tender heart with horror, the\r\nsentence of hanging, first to be put into execution, and followed by\r\ndecapitation. The horrible particularities were added--\"_of being hanged\r\nby the neck,--but not till you are dead--for you must be cut down\r\nalive;_\"--the rest of this sentence, since it has long ago been suffered\r\nto fall into oblivion, may, for the sake of our English feelings, rest\r\nthere. By those to whom it was addressed, it was heard in the full\r\nconviction that it might be carried out on them: since that very\r\nmorning, nine prisoners of gentle birth had suffered the extreme\r\npenalties of that barbarous law.[373]\r\n\r\nOf the calm manner in which his doom was heard by one of the state\r\nprisoners, Horace Walpole has left the following striking anecdote:\r\n\r\n\"Old Balmerino keeps up his spirits to the same pitch of gaiety: in the\r\ncell at Westminster, he showed Lord Kilmarnock how he must lay his head;\r\nbid him not wince, lest the strokes should cut his head or his\r\nshoulders; and advised him to bite his lips. As they were to return, he\r\nbegged they might have another bottle together, as they should never\r\nmeet any more till--he pointed to his neck. At getting into his coach,\r\nhe said to the gaoler, 'Take care, or you will break my shins with this\r\nd----d axe.'\"[374]\r\n\r\nThe English populace could not forbear delighting in the composure of\r\nBalmerino, who, on returning from Westminster Hall after his sentence,\r\ncould stop the coach in which he was about to be conducted to the Tower\r\nto buy gooseberries; or, as he expressed it in his national phrase,\r\n_honey-blobs_.[375]\r\n\r\nThat night, not contented with saying publicly at his levee, that Lord\r\nKilmarnock had proposed murdering the English prisoners, the Duke of\r\nCumberland proposed giving his mistress a ball; but the notion was\r\nabandoned, lest it should have been regarded as an insult to the\r\nprisoners, and _not_ because a particle of highminded regret for the\r\nsufferers could ever enter that hard and depraved heart. Too well did\r\nthe citizens of London understand the Duke of Cumberland's merits,\r\nwhen, it being proposed to present him with the freedom of some company,\r\none of the aldermen cried aloud, \"Then let it be of the Butchers'!\"[376]\r\n\r\nThe commission was dissolved in the usual forms: \"all manner of persons\r\nhere present were desired to depart in the fear of God, and of our\r\nsovereign Lord the King.\" The white staff of office was broken by the\r\nLord High Steward; the Lords adjourned to the Chamber of Parliament; the\r\nprisoners returned to the Tower.[377]\r\n\r\nThree weeks elapsed, after the trial, before the execution of Lord\r\nKilmarnock and Lord Balmerino. During that interval, hope sometimes\r\nvisited the prisoners in their cells, great intercession being made for\r\nthem by persons of the highest rank. But it was in vain, for the\r\ncounsels of the Duke of Cumberland influenced the heart of his royal\r\nfather, who it is generally believed, would otherwise have been disposed\r\nto compassion. During this interval, the sorrows of the prisoners were\r\naggravated by frequent rumours that their beloved Prince was taken; but\r\nhe was safe among his Highlanders, and defied the power even of an armed\r\nforce to surprise him in his singular and various retreats.\r\n\r\nThe Earl of Cromartie was the only one of the three prisoners to whom\r\nroyal mercy was extended. This nobleman had been considered, before the\r\nInsurrection, as the only branch of the Mackenzies who could be relied\r\nupon. He had been backward in joining the Jacobite army, and had never\r\nshared the confidence of Charles Edward. He had been disgusted with the\r\npreference shown to Murray and to Sullivan, to the prejudice of more\r\npowerful adherents of the cause: and it was reported, had rather\r\nsurrendered himself to the Earl of Sutherland's followers, than resisted\r\nwhen they apprehended him.[378]\r\n\r\nAmiable in private life, affable in manner, and exempt from the pride of\r\na Highland chieftain, this nobleman had been beloved by his neighbours\r\nof inferior rank; to the poor he had been a kind benefactor. The\r\ndomestic relations of life he had fulfilled irreproachably. Every heart\r\nbled for him; and the case of his son, Lord Macleod, who had espoused\r\nthe same cause, excited universal commiseration.\r\n\r\nOn the Sunday following the trial, Lady Cromartie presented her petition\r\nto the King: he gave her no hopes; and the unhappy woman fainted when he\r\nleft her.\r\n\r\nIt is pleasing to rest upon one action of clemency, before returning to\r\nthe horrors of capital punishment. To the intercession of Frederick\r\nPrince of Wales, Lord Cromartie eventually owed his life; that\r\nintercession is believed to have been procured by the merits and the\r\nattractions of Lady Cromartie, who was indefatigable in her exertions.\r\n\r\nThis Lady, the daughter of Sir William Gordon of Dalfolly, is said to\r\nhave possessed every quality that could render a husband happy.\r\nBeautiful and intellectual, she manifested a degree of spirit and\r\nperseverance when called upon to act in behalf of her husband and\r\nchildren, that raised her character to that of a heroine. She was then\r\nthe mother of nine children, and about to give birth to a tenth. During\r\nthe period of suspense, her conduct presented that just medium between\r\nstoicism and excess of feeling, which so few persons in grief can\r\ncommand.[379]\r\n\r\nAt last, a reprieve for Lord Cromartie arrived on the eleventh of\r\nAugust; it was not, however, followed by a release, nor even by a free\r\npardon. During two years, Lord Cromartie was detained a prisoner in the\r\nTower, there, being condemned to witness the departure of his generous\r\nfriends, Kilmarnock and Balmerino, to the scaffold. On February the\r\neighteenth, 1748, he was permitted to leave his prison, and to lodge in\r\nthe house of a messenger. In the following August he went into\r\nDevonshire, where he was desired to remain. A pardon passed the Great\r\nSeal for his Lordship on the twentieth of October, 1749, with a\r\ncondition that he should remain in any place directed by the King. He\r\ndied in Poland-street in London, on the twenty-eighth of September,\r\n1766.[380]\r\n\r\nOn Thursday, the seventh of August, the Reverend James Foster, a\r\nPresbyterian minister, was allowed access to Lord Kilmarnock, to prepare\r\nhim for a fate which now seemed inevitable. Great intercession had been\r\nmade for the ill-fated prisoner, by his kinsman, James, sixth Duke of\r\nHamilton, and husband of the celebrated beauty, Miss Gunning; but the\r\nfriendly efforts of that nobleman were thought rather to have \"hurried\r\nhim to the block.\"[381] When a report reached him that one of the\r\nprisoners would be spared, Lord Kilmarnock had desired, with the utmost\r\nnobleness of soul, that Cromartie should be preferred to himself.\r\nBalmerino lamented that he had not been taken with Lord Lovat; \"for\r\nthen,\" he remarked, \"we might have been sacrificed, and these two brave\r\nmen have been spared.\" But these regrets were unavailing, and Lord\r\nKilmarnock and his friend prepared to meet their doom.\r\n\r\nMr. Foster, on conversing with Lord Kilmarnock, found him humbled, but\r\nnot crushed by his misfortunes; contrite for a life characterized by\r\nmany errors, but trustful of the Infinite mercy, to which we fondly turn\r\nfrom the stern justice of unforgiving man. And the reverend gentleman on\r\nwhom the solemn responsibility of preparing a soul for judgment was\r\ndevolved, appears to have discharged his task with a due sense of its\r\ndelicacy, with fidelity and kindness.\r\n\r\nHaving introduced himself to Lord Kilmarnock with the premises that his\r\nLordship would allow him to deal freely with him; that he did not expect\r\nto be flattered, nor to have the malignity of his crimes disguised or\r\nsoftened;--Mr. Foster told him, \"that in his opinion, the wound of his\r\nmind, occasioned by his private and public vices, must be probed and\r\nsearched to the bottom, before it could be capable of receiving a\r\nremedy.\" \"If he disapproved of this plan,\" Mr. Foster thought \"he could\r\nbe of no use to him, and therefore declined attendance.\" To this Lord\r\nKilmarnock replied that, \"whilst he thought it was not Mr. Foster's\r\nprovince to interfere in things remote from his office, yet it was now\r\nno time to prevaricate with him, nor to play the hypocrite with God,\r\nbefore whose tribunal he should shortly appear.\"\r\n\r\nThis point being settled, the minister of the Gospel deemed it necessary\r\nto persuade the Earl, that he was not to be amused with vain delusive\r\nhopes of a reprieve; that he must view his sentence as inevitable;\r\notherwise that his mind might be distracted between hope and fear; and\r\nthat true temper of penitence which alone could recommend him to Divine\r\nmercy would be unattainable.\r\n\r\nThe unfortunate Earl touchingly answered, that indeed, when he consulted\r\nhis reason, and argued calmly with himself, he could see no ground of\r\nmercy; yet still the hope of life would intrude itself. He was afraid,\r\nhe said, that buoyed up by this delusive hope, when the warrant for his\r\nexecution came down, he should have not only the terror of his sentence\r\nto contend with, but the fond delusions of his own heart:--to overcome\r\nthe bitter disappointment--the impossibility of submission. He therefore\r\nassured Mr. Foster, that he would do all in his own power to repel that\r\nvisionary enemy, and to fix his thoughts on the important task of\r\nperfecting his repentance, and of preparing for death and eternity.\r\n\r\nIn regard to the part which Lord Kilmarnock had taken in recent events,\r\nthere seemed no difficulty in impressing his mind with a deep sense of\r\nthe responsibility which he had incurred in helping to diffuse terror\r\nand consternation through the land, in the depredation and ruin of his\r\ncountry: and in convincing him that he ought to consider himself\r\naccessory to innumerable private oppressions and murders. \"Yes,\" replied\r\nLord Kilmarnock, with deep emotion \"and murders of the innocent too,\"\r\nAnd frequently he acknowledged this charge with tears, and offered up\r\nshort petitions to God for mercy.\r\n\r\nBut when Mr. Foster mentioned to him that the consequences of the\r\n\"Rebellion and its natural tendency was to the subversion of our\r\nexcellent free constitution, to extirpate our holy religion, and to\r\nintroduce the monstrous superstitions and cruelties of Popery,\" Lord\r\nKilmarnock hesitated; and owned, at length, that he did not contemplate\r\nsuch mischiefs as the result of the contest; that he did not believe\r\nthat the young Chevalier would run the risk of defeating his main design\r\nby introducing Popery; nor would so entirely forget the warnings which\r\nthe history of his family offered, so far as to make any attacks upon\r\nthe liberties and constitution of the country. His entering into the\r\nRebellion was occasioned, as he then declared, by the errors and vices\r\nof his previous life; and was a kind of desperate scheme to extricate\r\nhim from his difficulties. Humbled and penetrated by the remembrance of\r\nformer levity, Lord Kilmarnock remarked, that not only was Providence\r\nwise and righteous, but to him, gracious; and that he regarded it as an\r\nunspeakable mercy to his soul, that he had not fallen at the battle of\r\nCulloden, impenitent and unreflecting; for that, if the Rebellion had\r\nbeen successful, he should have gone on in his errors, without ever\r\nentertaining any serious thought of amendment. \"Often,\" added the\r\ncontrite and chastened man, \"have I made use of these words of Christ,\r\n'Father, if it be possible, let this cup pass from me: nevertheless, not\r\nas I will, but as thou wilt.'\" But he had checked himself by the\r\nreflection, that it was not for him who had been so great a sinner, to\r\naddress himself to God in the same language with his blessed Saviour,\r\nwho was perfectly innocent and holy.\r\n\r\nIn time, aided by the representations of his spiritual attendant, the\r\ndeepest remorse for a life not untainted by impurity of conduct, was\r\nsucceeded by religious peace. It was then that the prisoner turned to\r\nthat Bread of Life which Christ hath left for those who hunger and\r\nthirst after righteousness. But the Minister who led him into the fold\r\nof the Great Shepherd, would not consent to administer to him the Holy\r\nSacrament without a full confession made in the presence of the\r\ngentleman gaoler, of his past offences, and of his contrition for them.\r\nAt that solemn moment, when the heart was laid open to human witnesses,\r\nLord Kilmarnock professed the deepest penitence for his concurrence in\r\nthe Rebellion, and for the irregularities of his private life: he\r\ndeclared his conviction that the Holy Sacrament would be of no benefit\r\nto him whatsoever, if his remorse and contrition were not sincere. This\r\nassurance was, in other words, yet, in substance the same, emphatically\r\nrepeated. During the conversations held with Lord Kilmarnock, Mr. Foster\r\nperceived that the confessions of the penitent were free and ingenuous;\r\nthat he examined his own heart with a searching and scrupulous care,\r\nsternly challenging memory to the aid of conscience. At last, he\r\ndeclared that he should rather prefer the speedy execution of his\r\nsentence to a longer life, if he were sure that he should again be\r\nentangled by the snares and temptations of the world. This was a few\r\ndays before his death.\r\n\r\nGradually, but effectually, the spirit that had so much in it of a\r\nheavenly temper; the heart, so framed to be beloved, was purified and\r\nelevated; so that, a beautiful and holy calm, a heavenly\r\ndisinterestedness, a patience worthy of him who bore the name of\r\nChristian, were manifested in one whom it were henceforth wrong to call\r\nunhappy. When Lord Cromartie's reprieve became known to Mr. Foster, he\r\ndreaded, lest this subdued, yet fortified mind, should be disturbed by\r\nthe jealousies to which our worldly condition is prone: he trembled lest\r\nthe sorrow of separation from a world which Lord Kilmarnock had loved\r\ntoo fondly, should be revived by the pardon of his friend. \"Therefore,\"\r\nrelates Mr. Foster, \"in the morning before I waited upon him, I prepared\r\nmyself to quiet and mollify his mind. But one of the first things he\r\nsaid to me was, that he was extremely glad that the King's mercy had\r\nbeen shown to Lord Cromartie.\" \"My Lord,\" inquired Mr. Foster, \"I hope\r\nyou do not think you have any injustice shown you?\" Lord Kilmarnock's\r\nanswer was, \"Not in the least; I have pleaded guilty: I entirely\r\nacquiesce in the justice of my sentence; and if mercy be extended to\r\nanother, I can have no reason to complain, when nothing but justice is\r\ndone to me.\"\r\n\r\nWith regard to some points upon which the public odium was directed to\r\nthe young Chevalier and his party, Lord Kilmarnock was very explicit in\r\nhis last conversations with Mr. Foster. We have already seen how far he\r\nwas enabled to clear himself concerning his conduct to the prisoners at\r\nInverness. A report having been industriously circulated, probably with\r\na view to excuse the barbarities of the Duke of Cumberland, that an\r\norder had been issued in the Pretender's council at Inverness, to\r\ndestroy the prisoners who might be taken at the battle of Culloden, Mr.\r\nFoster put the question to Lord Kilmarnock, Whether that statement were\r\ntrue? \"I can most sincerely and freely answer, No,\" was the satisfactory\r\nreply; and a similar contradiction was given by the dying man to every\r\naccusation of a similar tendency.[382]\r\n\r\nOn Monday the eleventh of August, General Williamson desired Mr. Foster,\r\n\"in the gentlest terms that he could use, to apprize Lord Kilmarnock,\r\nthat he had received the order for his, and for Lord Balmerino's\r\nexecution.\" Mr. Foster at first refused to undertake this office. \"I was\r\nso shocked at it,\" writes the good man \"that I could not think of\r\ndelivering the message myself, but would endeavour to prepare the\r\nunfortunate Lord for it, by divesting him, as far as I could, of all\r\nhope of life.\" Such, indeed, had been the continual aim of all the\r\nreverend minister's counsels; and he had hoped to entrust the last\r\nmournful task of informing him of the order to other hands. On finding\r\nLord Kilmarnock in a very resigned and calm state of mind, he ventured,\r\nhowever, to hint to him how necessary was that diligent and constant\r\npreparation for death which he had endeavoured to impress upon his mind.\r\nThis was sufficient: the ill-fated prisoner immediately inquired,\r\n\"whether the warrant for his execution was come down?\" \"I told him that\r\nit was,\" relates Mr. Foster, \"and that the day fixed upon was the\r\nfollowing Monday.\"\r\n\r\nLord Kilmarnock received this intimation with a solemn consciousness of\r\nthe awful nature of its import; but no signs of terror nor of anxiety\r\nadded to the sorrows of that hour. In the course of conversation, he\r\nobserved to Mr. Foster, that \"he was chiefly concerned about the\r\nconsequences of death, in comparison of which he considered the 'thing\r\nitself' a trifle: with regard to the manner of his death he had, he\r\nthought, no great reason to be terrified, for that the stroke appeared\r\nto be scarcely so much as the drawing of a tooth, or the first shock of\r\na cold bath upon a weak and fearful temper.\" At the last hour,\r\nnevertheless, the crowd,--the scaffold,--the doom, upset that sublime\r\nand heavenly resignation,--the weakness of the flesh prevailed, although\r\nonly for an instant.\r\n\r\nIn the silence and solitude of his prison, Lord Kilmarnock's\r\nrecollection reverted to those whom human nature were shortly to be left\r\nto buffet with the storms of their hard fate. It reverted also to those\r\nwho might, in any way, have suffered at his hands. The following\r\ntouching epistle, addressed to his factor, Mr. Robert Paterson, written\r\ntwo days only before his execution, shows how tender was his affection\r\nfor his unhappy wife: in how Christian a spirit towards others he died.\r\nHis consideration for the poor shoemakers of Elgin is one of those\r\nbeautiful traits of character which mark a conscientious mind. The\r\noriginal of this letter is still in existence, and is in the possession\r\nof the great-grandson of him to whom it was addressed.[383]\r\n\r\n    \"Sir,\r\n\r\n    \"I have commended to your care the inclosed packet, to be delivered\r\n    to my wife in the manner your good sense shall dictate to you, will\r\n    be least shocking to her. Let her be prepared for it as much by\r\n    degrees, and with great tenderness, as the nature of the thing will\r\n    admit of. The entire dependance I have all my life had the most just\r\n    reason to have on your integrity and friendship to my wife and\r\n    family, as well as to myself, make me desire that the inclosed\r\n    papers may come to my wife through your hands, in confidence; but\r\n    you will take all the pains to comfort her, and relieve the grief I\r\n    know she will be in, that you and her friends can. She is what I\r\n    leave dearest behind me in the world; and the greatest service you\r\n    can do to your dead friend, is to contribute as much as possible to\r\n    her happiness in mind, and in her affairs.\r\n\r\n    \"You will peruse the State[384] before you deliver it to her, and\r\n    you will observe that there is a fund of hers (I don't mention that\r\n    of five hundred Scots a-year); as the interest of my mother-in-law's\r\n    portion in the Countess of Errol's hands, with, I believe, a\r\n    considerable arrear upon it; which, as I have ordered a copy of all\r\n    these papers to that Countess, I did not care to put in. There is\r\n    another thing of a good deal of moment, which I mention only to you,\r\n    because if it could be taken away without noise it would be better;\r\n    but if it is pushed it will be necessary to defend it. That is, a\r\n    bond which you know Mr. Kerr, Director to the Chancery, has of me\r\n    for a considerable sum of money, with many years interest on it,\r\n    which was almost all play debt. I don't think I ever had fifty\r\n    pounds, or the half of it, of Mr. Kerr's money, and I am sure I\r\n    never had a hundred; which however I have put it to, in the inclosed\r\n    declaration, that my mind may be entirely at ease. My intention with\r\n    respect to that sum was to wait till I had some money, and then buy\r\n    it off, by a composition of three hundred pounds, and if that was\r\n    not accepted of, to defend it; in which I neither saw, nor now see\r\n    anything unjust; and now I leave it on my successors to do what they\r\n    find most prudent in it. Beside my personal debt mentioned in\r\n    general and particular in the State,[385] there is one for which I\r\n    am liable in justice, if it is not paid, owing to poor people, who\r\n    gave their work for it by my orders; it was at Elgin in Murray; the\r\n    regiment I commanded wanted shoes. I commissioned something about\r\n    seventy pair of shoes and brogues, which might come to about three\r\n    shillings, or three and sixpence each, one with another. The\r\n    magistrates divided them among the shoemakers of the town and\r\n    country, and each shoemaker furnished his proportion. I drew on the\r\n    town for the price out of the composition laid on them, but I was\r\n    told afterwards at Inverness, that it was believed the composition\r\n    was otherwise applied, and the poor shoemakers not paid. As these\r\n    poor people wrought by my orders, it will be a great ease to my\r\n    heart to think they are not to lose by me, as too many have done in\r\n    the course of that year; but had I lived, I might have made some\r\n    enquiry after it; but now it is impossible, as their hardships in\r\n    loss of horses, and such things which happened through my soldiers,\r\n    are so interwoven with what was done by other people, that it would\r\n    be very hard, if not impossible, to separate them. If you will write\r\n    to Mr. Jones of Dalkinty, at Elgin, (with whom I was quartered when\r\n    I lay there,) he will send you an account of the shoes, and if they\r\n    were paid to the shoemakers or no; and if they are not, I beg you'll\r\n    get my wife, or my successors, to pay them when they can.\r\n\r\n    \"Receive a letter to me from Mrs. Boyd, my cousin Malcomb's widow; I\r\n    shall desire her to write to you for an answer.\r\n\r\n    \"Accept of my sincere thanks for your friendship and good services\r\n    to me. Continue them to my wife and children.\r\n\r\n    \"My best wishes are to you and yours, and for the happiness and\r\n    prosperity of the good town of Kilmarnock, and I am, sir, your\r\n    humble servant,\r\n\r\n                                                       \"KILMARNOCK.\"\r\n\r\n    Tower of London, August 16th, 1746.\r\n\r\nOn the Saturday previous to the execution of Lord Kilmarnock, General\r\nWilliamson gave his prisoners a minute account of all the circumstances\r\nof solemnity, and outward terror, which would accompany it. Lord\r\nKilmarnock heard it much with the same expression of concern as a man of\r\na compassionate disposition would read it, in relation to others. After\r\nsuggesting a trifling alteration in the arrangements after the\r\nexecution, he expressed his regret that the headsman should be, as\r\nGeneral Williamson informed him, a \"good sort of man;\" remarking, that\r\none of a rougher nature and harder heart, would be more likely to do\r\nhis work quickly. He then requested that four persons might be appointed\r\nto receive the head when it was severed from the body, in a red cloth;\r\nthat it might not, as he had heard was the case at other executions,\r\n\"roll about the scaffold and be mangled and disfigured.\" \"For I would\r\nnot,\" he added, \"though it may be but a trifling matter, that my remains\r\nshould appear with any needless indecency after the just sentence of the\r\nlaw is satisfied.\" He spoke calmly and easily on all these particulars,\r\nnor did he even shrink when told that his head would be held up and\r\nexhibited to the multitude as that of a traitor. \"He knew,\" he said,\r\n\"that it was usual, and it did not affect him.\" During these singular\r\nconversations, his spiritual attendant and the General, could hardly\r\nhave been more precise in their descriptions had they been portraying\r\nthe festive ceremonials of a coming bridal, than they were in the\r\nfearful minutiae of the approaching execution. It was thought by them\r\nthat such recitals would accustom the mind of the prisoner to the\r\napparatus and formalities that would attend his death, and that these\r\nwould lose their influence over his mind. \"He allowed with me,\" observes\r\nMr. Foster, \"that such circumstances were not so melancholy as dying\r\nafter a lingering disorder, in a darkened room, with weeping friends\r\naround one, and whilst the shattered frame sank under slow exhaustion.\"\r\nBut experience and human feelings contradict this observation of the\r\nresigned and unhappy sufferer; we look to death, under such an aspect,\r\nas the approach of rest; but human nature shrinks from the violent\r\nstruggle, the momentary but fierce convulsion, plunging us, as it were,\r\ninto the abyss of the grave.\r\n\r\nAt this moment of his existence, when it was certain ruin at Court and\r\nin the army, to befriend the Jacobite prisoner, a friend, the friend of\r\nhis youth, came nobly forward to attend Lord Kilmarnock in his dying\r\nmoments. This was John Walkinshaw Craufurd, of Craufurdland in the\r\ncounty of Ayr, between whose family and that of the House of Boyd, a\r\nlong and intimate friendship of several centuries had existed; \"so much\r\nso,\" observes a member of the present family of Craufurd,[386] \"that a\r\nsubterranean passage is said to exist between our old castles, of which\r\nwe _fancy_ proofs; but these are fire-side legends.\"\r\n\r\n\"The family of Craufurd,\" observes Mr. Burke, \"is one of antiquity and\r\neminence in a part of the empire where ancestry and exploit have ever\r\nbeen held in enthusiastic admiration.\" By marriage, in the thirteenth\r\ncentury, it is allied anciently with the existing house of Loudon; and\r\nits connection and friendship with the House of Boyd was cemented by the\r\ndeath of one of its heads, Robert Craufurd, in 1487, in consequence of a\r\nwound received at the Wyllielee, from attending James Boyd, Earl of\r\nArran, in a duel with the Earl of Eglintoun. In the days of Charles the\r\nFirst and Second, the Craufurds had been Covenanters, as appears in the\r\nhistory of that time: and in the year 1745, they were stanch Whigs; and\r\nColonel Walkinshaw Craufurd had, when called upon to pay a mournful\r\nproof of respect to Lord Kilmarnock, attained the rank of Colonel in the\r\nBritish army. Besides the ancient friendship of the family, there had\r\nbeen several intermarriages; and the father of Colonel Craufurd had\r\nespoused, after the death of Miss Walkinshaw, Elenora, the widow of the\r\nHonorable Thomas Boyd, the brother of Lord Kilmarnock.\r\n\r\nColonel Walkinshaw Craufurd was a fine specimen of the true Scottish\r\ngentleman, and of the British officer. He was a very handsome, stately\r\nman, of high-bred manners, and portly figure, whom his tenantry both\r\nfeared and honoured. He lived almost continually in the highest circles\r\nin London, except when in service, and also at the Court, visiting his\r\nCastle in Ayrshire only in the hunting season, for he kept a pack of\r\nhounds. To such a man the sacrifice of public opinion, then all against\r\nthe Jacobites,--the sure loss of Court favour,--the risk of losing all\r\nmilitary promotion, were no small considerations; yet he cast them all\r\nto the winds, and came nobly forward to pay the last respect to his\r\nkinsman and friend.\r\n\r\nAlready had he distinguished himself at the battle of Dettingen and\r\nFontenoy; and he might reasonably expect the highest military honours:\r\nyet he incurred the risk of attending Lord Kilmarnock on the scaffold,\r\nand performing that office for him which that nobleman required. I\r\nalmost blush to write the sequel; for _this_ act, Colonel Craufurd was,\r\nimmediately after the last scene was over, put down to the very bottom\r\nof the army list.[387] Such was the petty and vindictive policy of the\r\nBritish Government, influenced, it may be presumed, by the same dark\r\nmind that visited upon the faithful Highlanders the horrors of military\r\nlaw, in punishment of their fidelity and heroism. \"The King,\" observes\r\nHorace Walpole, referring to these and other acts, \"is much inclined to\r\nmercy; but the Duke of Cumberland, who has not so much of Caesar after a\r\nvictory, as in gaining it, is for the utmost severity.\"[388]\r\n\r\nWhilst the mind of Lord Kilmarnock was thus gradually prepared for\r\ndeath, Lord Balmerino passed cheerfully the hours which were so soon to\r\nterminate in his doom. Fondly attached to his young wife, Balmerino\r\nobtained the boon of her society in his prison. So much were the people\r\nattracted by the hardihood and humour of this brave old man, that it was\r\nfound necessary by the authorities to stop up the windows of his\r\nprison-chamber in the Tower, in order to prevent his talking to the\r\npopulace out of the window. One only was left unclosed, with\r\ncharacteristic cruelty: it commanded a view of the scaffolding erected\r\nfor his execution.[389] One day the Lieutenant of the Tower brought in\r\nthe warrant for his death: Lady Balmerino fainted. \"Lieutenant,\" said\r\nLord Balmerino, \"with your d----d warrant you have spoiled my Lady's\r\ndinner.\"\r\n\r\nLord Balmerino is said to have written to the Duke of Cumberland a \"very\r\nsensible letter,\" requesting his intercession with the King; but this\r\nseems to have been unavailing, from the well-known exclamation of George\r\nthe Second, when solicited for the other prisoners, \"Will no one speak a\r\nword to me for poor Balmerino?\"\r\n\r\nThe day appointed for the execution was the eighteenth of August, at\r\neight in the morning. Mr. Foster visited Lord Kilmarnock, and found him\r\nin a calm and happy temper, without any disturbance of that serenity\r\nwhich had of late blessed his days of imprisonment. He affected not to\r\nbrave death, but viewed it in the awful aspect in which even the best of\r\nmen, and the most hopeful Christians, must consider that solemn change.\r\nHe expressed his belief, that a man who had led a dissolute life, and\r\nwho yet believed the consequences of death, to affect indifference at\r\nthat hour, showed himself either to be very impious, or very stupid.\r\nOne apprehension still clung to his mind, proving how sensitive had been\r\nthat conscience which strove in vain to satisfy itself. He told Mr.\r\nFoster \"he could not be sure that his repentance was sincere, because it\r\nhad never been tried by the temptation of returning to society.\"\r\n\r\nLord Kilmarnock continued in a composed state of mind during the whole\r\nmorning. After a short prayer, offered up by Mr. Foster, at his desire,\r\nhe was informed that the sheriffs waited for the prisoners. He heard\r\nthis announcement calmly; and said to General Williamson, with his\r\nwonted grace, \"General, I am ready to follow you.\" He then quitted his\r\nprison, and descended the stairs. As he was going down, he met Lord\r\nBalmerino; and the friends embraced. \"My Lord,\" said the noble\r\nBalmerino, \"I am heartily sorry to have your company in this\r\nexpedition.\"[390]\r\n\r\nThe prisoners then proceeded to the outward gate of the Tower, where the\r\nSheriffs, who had walked there in procession, received them: this was\r\nabout ten o'clock in the morning of the eighteenth of August. The bodies\r\nof the two noblemen having been delivered with the usual formalities to\r\nthe Sheriffs, they proceeded to the late Transport Office, a building\r\nnear the scaffold. Two Presbyterian ministers, Mr. Foster and Mr. Home,\r\naccompanied Lord Kilmarnock, whilst the Chaplain of the Tower and\r\nanother clergyman, attended Lord Balmerino. Three rooms, hung with\r\nblack, were prepared; one for each of the condemned noblemen; another,\r\nfronting the scaffold, for spectators. Here, those who were so soon to\r\nsuffer, had a short conference with each other, chiefly relating to the\r\norder, said to have been issued at Culloden, to give no quarter. This\r\nwas a subject, not only of importance to Lord Kilmarnock's memory, but\r\nto the character of the Jacobite party generally.\r\n\r\n\"Did you, my Lord,\" said the generous Balmerino, still anxious, even at\r\nthe last hour, to justify his friends, \"see or know of any order, signed\r\nby the Prince, to give no quarter at the battle of Culloden?\"\r\n\r\n\"No, my Lord,\" replied Kilmarnock.\r\n\r\n\"Nor I neither,\" rejoined Balmerino; \"and therefore it seems to be an\r\ninvention to justify their own murderous scheme.\"\r\n\r\nTo this Lord Kilmarnock answered, \"No, my Lord, I do not think it can be\r\nan invention, because, while I was a prisoner at Inverness, I was told\r\nby several officers that there was such an order, signed 'George\r\nMurray,' and that it was in the Duke of Cumberland's custody.\" To this\r\nstatement, (which was wholly erroneous) Lord Balmerino exclaimed, \"Lord\r\nGeorge Murray! Why then, they should not charge it on the Prince.\" After\r\nthis explanation, he bade Kilmarnock a last farewell: as he embraced\r\nhim, he said, in the same noble spirit, that he had ever shown, \"My dear\r\nLord Kilmarnock, I am only sorry I cannot pay all this reckoning alone:\r\nonce more, farewell for ever.\"\r\n\r\nLord Kilmarnock was then left with the sheriffs, and his spiritual\r\nadvisers. In their presence, he solemnly declared himself to be a\r\nProtestant, and said that he was thoroughly satisfied of the legality of\r\nthe King's claim to the throne. He had been educated in these\r\nprinciples, and he now thoroughly repented having ever engaged in the\r\nRebellion. He afterwards stated to his friends that he had within this\r\nweek taken the sacrament twice in evidence of the truth of his\r\nrepentance.\r\n\r\nThe hour of noon was now fast approaching, when the last act of\r\nrelentless justice was to be performed. Mr. Foster, after permitting the\r\nEarl a few moments to compose himself, suggested that he should engage\r\nwith him in prayer, and afterwards proceed to the scaffold. The minister\r\nthen addressed himself to all who were present, urging them to join with\r\nhim in this last solemn office, and in recommending the soul of an\r\nunhappy penitent to the mercy of God. Those who were engaged in this sad\r\nscene, sank on their knees, whilst, after a petition relating to the\r\nprisoner, a prayer was offered up \"for King George, for our holy\r\nreligion, for our inestimable British liberties.\" This prayer, for the\r\nroyal family, Lord Kilmarnock had often protested he would, at the\r\nlatest moment, offer up to the throne of God.\r\n\r\nAfter this solemn duty had been performed, Lord Kilmarnock bade an\r\naffectionate farewell to the gentlemen who had accompanied him, and here\r\nMr. Foster's office ceased, the Rev. Mr. Home, a young clergyman, and a\r\npersonal friend of Lord Kilmarnock, succeeding him in attendance upon\r\nthe prisoner. Many reports prevailed of Lord Kilmarnock's fear of death,\r\nand of the weakness of his resolution; and Balmerino, it is said,\r\napprehended that he would not \"behave well,\" an expression used,\r\nperhaps, in reference to his opinions, perhaps in anticipation of a\r\nfailure of courage. As leaning upon the arm of his friend Mr. Home,\r\nLord Kilmarnock saw, for the first time, that outward apparatus of death\r\nto which he had taken such pains to familiarise himself; \"nature still\r\nrecurred upon him;\"--for an instant, the home of peace, to which he was\r\nhastening, was forgotten;--\"the multitude, the block, the coffin, the\r\nexecutioner, the instrument of death,\" appalled one, whose character was\r\namiable, rather than exalted. He turned to his attendant, and exclaimed,\r\n\"Home, this is terrible!\" Yet his countenance, even as he uttered these\r\nwords, was unchanged, and in a few moments, he regained the composure of\r\none whose hope was in the mercy of his Creator. What else could sustain\r\nhim in the agonies of that moment? \"His whole behaviour,\" writes Mr.\r\nFoster, \"was so humble and resigned, that not only his friends, but\r\nevery spectator, was deeply moved; the executioner burst into tears, and\r\nwas obliged to use artificial spirits to support and strengthen him.\" As\r\nthe man kneeled down, after the usual custom, to pray for forgiveness,\r\nLord Kilmarnock desired him to have courage, and placing a purse of gold\r\nin his hand, told him that the dropping of a handkerchief should be the\r\nsignal for the blow.\r\n\r\nMr. Foster having rejoined Lord Kilmarnock on the scaffold, a long\r\nconversation, in a low voice, took place between them; for Lord\r\nKilmarnock made no speech. \"I wish,\" said Mr. Foster, \"I had a voice\r\nloud enough to tell the multitude with what sentiments your Lordship\r\nquits the world.\" Again, the unfortunate nobleman embraced his friends;\r\nand bade Mr. Foster, who quitted the scaffold a few minutes before his\r\nexecution, a last farewell. During all this time, which was more than\r\nhalf an hour, he took no notice of the multitude below: except,\r\nobserving that the green baize over the wall obstructed the view, he\r\ndesired that it might be lifted up that the crowd might see the\r\nspectacle of his execution.\r\n\r\nA delay now took place, attributed by some to Lord Kilmarnock's\r\n\"unwillingness to depart:\"[391] but owing to a few trivial circumstances\r\nwhich, as Mr. Foster remarks, \"are unnecessary to be mentioned in order\r\nto vindicate the noble penitent from the imputation of fear in the\r\ncritical moment.\" To the last, a scrupulous attention to decorum, and\r\nnicety in dress characterized Lord Kilmarnock. At his trial, he was\r\ndescribed as having been a little too precise, and his hair \"too exactly\r\ndressed for a person in his situation.\" On the scaffold the same care\r\nwas manifested. He appeared in a mourning suit, and his hair, which was\r\nunpowdered, was dressed according to the fashion of the day, in a bag,\r\nwhich it took some time to undo, in order to replace the bag by a cap.\r\nEven then, the cap being large, and the hair long, his lordship was\r\napprehensive that some of the hair might escape, and intercept the\r\nstroke of the axe. He therefore requested a gentleman near him, to tie\r\nthe cap round his head, that he might bind up the hair more closely. As\r\nthis office was performed, the person to whom he had applied, wished his\r\nlordship a continuance of his resolution until he should meet with\r\neternal happiness. \"I thank you,\" returned Lord Kilmarnock, with his\r\nusual courtesy and sweetness; \"I find myself perfectly easy and\r\nresigned.\"\r\n\r\nThere was also another impediment,--the tucking of his shirt under his\r\nwaistcoat was next adjusted. Then Lord Kilmarnock, taking out a paper\r\ncontaining the heads of his last devotions, advanced to the utmost stage\r\nof the scaffold, and kneeled down at the block, on which, in praying, he\r\nplaced his hands, until the executioner remonstrated, begging of him to\r\nlet his hands fall down, lest they should be mangled, or should\r\nintercept the blow. He was also told that the neck of his waistcoat was\r\nin the way; he therefore arose, and with the help of Colonel Walkinshaw\r\nCraufurd, had it taken off. Near him were standing those who held the\r\ncloth ready to receive his head; among these Mr. Home's servant heard\r\nLord Kilmarnock tell the executioner, that in two minutes he would give\r\nthe signal. A few moments were spent in fervent devotion; then the sign\r\nwas given, and the head was severed from the body by one stroke. It was\r\nnot exposed to view according to custom: but was deposited in a coffin\r\nwith the body, and delivered to his Lordship's friends. One peculiarity\r\nattended this execution. It is not required by law that the head of a\r\nperson decapitated should be exposed; but is a custom adopted in order\r\nto satisfy the multitude that the execution has been accomplished.\r\nSince, by Lord Kilmarnock's dying request, this practice was omitted,\r\nthe Sheriffs ordered that all the attendants on the scaffold should\r\nkneel down, so that the view of the execution might not be impeded[392]\r\nto those who were below.\r\n\r\nThe scaffold was immediately cleared, and put in order for another\r\nvictim; and Mr. Ford, the Under-Sheriff, who had attended the first\r\nexecution, went into the room in the Transport Office where Balmerino\r\nawaited his doom. \"I suppose,\" inquired the undaunted Balmerino, \"that\r\nmy Lord Kilmarnock is no more.\" And having asked how he died, and being\r\ntold the account, he said: \"It is well done, and now, gentlemen, I will\r\nno longer detain you, for I desire not to protract my life.\" He spoke\r\ncalmly, and even cheerfully; Lord Kilmarnock had shed tears as he bade\r\nhis friends farewell, but Balmerino, whilst others wept, was even\r\ncheerful, and hastened to the scaffold. His deportment, when in the room\r\nwhere he awaited the summons to death, was graceful and yet simple,\r\nwithout either any ostentation of bravery, or indications of\r\nindifference to his fate. He did not defy the terror, he rose above it.\r\nHe conversed freely with his friends, and refreshed himself twice with\r\nwine and bread, desiring the company to drink to him, as he expressed it\r\nin his Scottish phrase, \"ain degrae ta haiven;\" but above all, he prayed\r\noften and fervently for support, and support was given.\r\n\r\nTrue to the last to his professions, Lord Balmerino was dressed in what\r\nwas called by a contemporary, \"his Rebellious Regimentals,\" such as he\r\nhad worn at Culloden; they were of blue cloth, turned up with red;\r\nunderneath them was a flannel waistcoat and a shroud. He ascended the\r\nscaffold, \"treading,\" as an observer expressed it, \"with the air of a\r\nGeneral,\" and surveying the spectators, bowed to them; he walked round\r\nit, and read the inscription on his coffin, \"Arthurus Dominus de\r\nBalmerino, decollatus, 18^o die August. 1746, aetatis suae 58^o;\" observed\r\n\"that it was right,\" and with apparent pleasure looked at the block\r\nsaying, it was his \"pillow of rest.\" Lord Balmerino then pulling out his\r\nspectacles, read a paper to those who stood around him, and delivered it\r\nto the Sheriff to do with it as he thought proper. It was subsequently\r\nprinted in a garbled form, much of it being deemed too treasonable for\r\npublication, and in that form is preserved in the State Trials.[393] It\r\nis now given as it was really spoken.\r\n\r\n\"I was bred in the anti-revolution principles, which I have ever\r\npersevered in, from a sincere persuasion that the restoration of the\r\nRoyal Family, and the good of my native country, are inseparable. The\r\naction of my life which now stares me most in the face, is my having\r\naccepted a commission in the army from the late Princess Anne, who I\r\nknew had no more right to the crown than her predecessor, the Prince of\r\nOrange, whom I always considered as an infamous usurper.\r\n\r\n\"In the year 1715, as soon as the King landed in Scotland, I thought it\r\nmy indispensable duty to join his standard, though his affairs were then\r\nin a desperate situation.\r\n\r\n\"I was in Switzerland in the year 1734, where I received a letter from\r\nmy father acquainting me that he had procured me remission, and desiring\r\nme to return home. Not thinking myself at liberty to comply with my\r\nfather's desire without the King's approbation, I wrote to Rome to know\r\nhis Majesty's pleasure, and was directed by him to return home; and at\r\nthe same time I received a letter of credit upon his banker at Paris,\r\nwho furnished me with money to defray the expense of my journey, and put\r\nme in repair. I think myself bound, upon this occasion, to contradict a\r\nreport which has been industriously spread, and which I never heard of\r\ntill I was prisoner; that orders were given to the Prince's army to give\r\nno quarter at the battle of Culloden. With my eye upon the block, which\r\nwill soon bring me unto the highest of all tribunals, I do declare that\r\nit is without any manner of foundation, both because it is impossible it\r\ncould have escaped the knowledge of me, who was captain of the Prince's\r\nLife Guards, or of Lord Kilmarnock, who was colonel of his own regiment;\r\nbut still more so, as it is entirely inconsistent with the mild and\r\ngenerous nature of that brave Prince, whose patience, fortitude,\r\nintrepidity, and humanity, I must declare upon this solemn occasion, are\r\nqualities in which he excels all men I ever knew, and which it ever was\r\nhis desire to employ for the relief and preservation of his father's\r\nsubjects. I believe rather, that this report was spread to palliate and\r\nexcuse the murders they themselves committed in cold blood after the\r\nbattle of Culloden.\r\n\r\n\"I think it my duty to return my sincere acknowledgments to Major White\r\nand Mr. Fowler, for their humane and complaisant behaviour to me during\r\nmy confinement. I wish I could pay the same compliment to General\r\nWilliamson, who used me with the greatest inhumanity and cruelty; but\r\nhaving taken the sacrament this day, I forgive him, as I do all my\r\nenemies.\r\n\r\n\"I die in the religion of the Church of England, which I look upon as\r\nthe same with the Episcopal Church of Scotland, in which I was brought\r\nup.\"\r\n\r\nAfter delivering this speech, Lord Balmerino laid his head upon the\r\nblock, and said, \"God reward my friends, and forgive my enemies: bless\r\nand restore the King; preserve the Prince, and the Duke of York,--and\r\nreceive my soul.\"\r\n\r\nThe executioner then being called for, and kneeling to ask forgiveness,\r\nLord Balmerino interrupted him. \"Friend, you need not ask my\r\nforgiveness; the execution of your duty is commendable.\" He then gave\r\nthe headsman three guineas, saying, \"this is all I have; I can only add\r\nto it my coat and waistcoat,\" which, accordingly, he took off, laying\r\nthem on the coffin for the executioner. After putting on a flannel\r\njacket made for the occasion, and a plaid cap, he went to the block in\r\norder to show the executioner the signal. He then returned to his\r\nfriends. \"I am afraid,\" he said, addressing them, \"that there are some\r\nhere who may think my behaviour bold: remember, sir,\" he added,\r\naddressing a gentleman near him, \"what I tell you; it arises from a just\r\nconfidence in God, and a clear conscience.\" Memorable, and beautiful\r\nwords, distinguishing between the presumption of indifference, and the\r\nsecurity of a living faith. When he laid his head on the block to try\r\nit, he said, \"if I had a thousand lives I would lay them all down in the\r\nsame cause.\"\r\n\r\nLord Balmerino then showed the Executioner where to strike the blow; he\r\nexamined the edge of the axe, and bade the man to strike with\r\nresolution; \"for in _that_, friend,\" he said, as he replaced the axe in\r\nthe hand of the man, \"will consist your mercy.\" He asked how many\r\nstrokes had been given to Lord Kilmarnock. Two clergymen coming up at\r\nthat moment, he said, \"no, gentlemen, I believe you have already done me\r\nall the service you can.\" He called loudly to the warder, and gave him\r\nhis perriwig; and instantly laid down his head upon the block, but being\r\ntold that he was on the wrong side, he vaulted round, and extending his\r\narms uttered this short prayer: \"O Lord, reward my friends, forgive my\r\nenemies:\"--he uttered, it has been stated, another ejaculation for king\r\nJames; but that petition was suppressed in the printed accounts of his\r\ndeath: then, pronouncing these words, \"receive my soul,\" he gave the\r\nsignal by throwing up his arm, as if he were giving the signal for\r\nbattle. His intrepidity, and the suddenness of that last sign terrified\r\nthe executioner, whose arm became almost powerless; the affrighted man\r\nstruck the blow on the part directed, but though, it is hoped, it\r\ndestroyed all sensation, the head was not severed, but fell back on the\r\nshoulders, exhibiting a ghastly sight. Two more strokes of the axe were\r\nrequisite to complete the work. Then, the head having been received in a\r\npiece of scarlet cloth, the lifeless remains of the true, and noble\r\nhearted soldier were deposited in a coffin, and delivered to his\r\nfriends.\r\n\r\nA vast multitude viewed this spectacle, so execrable in its cruelty, so\r\ngreat in the deportment of the sufferers. Even on the masts of ships, in\r\nthe calm river, were the spectators piled; all classes of society were\r\ninterested in this memorable scene; and, for a few short weeks, the\r\nfashionable circles were diverted by the humours of Lady Townshend, and\r\nthe witticisms of George Selwyn. During the imprisonment of Kilmarnock,\r\nit had been the fancy of the former to station herself under the window\r\nof his chamber in one of the dismal towers in which he was detained; to\r\nsend messages to him, and to obtain his dog and snuff-box. But even this\r\nshow of affected feeling failed to make compassion fashionable in the\r\nregions of St. James's. Calumny was busy at the grave of the beheaded\r\nJacobites; and the accounts of those who attended them in their last\r\nhours were attacked by anonymous pamphleteers. It was said, among other\r\nthings, that Balmerino uttered no prayer at the last moment; and his\r\nbehaviour was contrasted with that of Kilmarnock. On this allegation,\r\nMr. Ford, the Under-Sheriff, who was on the scaffold, observes, \"the\r\nauthors of these attacks being concealed are unworthy of other notice,\r\nsince nothing is easier to an ingenious and unprejudiced mind, than to\r\ndistinguish between the subject and the man: my Lord Kilmarnock was\r\nhappily educated in right principles, which he deviated from, and\r\nrepented; whereas, the great, though unhappy Balmerino, was unfortunate\r\nin his,--but, as he lived, he died.\"[394]\r\n\r\nThe characters of these two noblemen, who, in life, held a very\r\ndissimilar course, until they cooeperated in arms, are strongly\r\ncontrasted. To Kilmarnock belonged the gentle qualities which enhance\r\nthe pleasures of society, but often, too, increase its perils: the\r\nsusceptible, affectionate nature, not fortified by self-controul; the\r\ncompassionate disposition, acting rather from impulse than principle.\r\nInfirm in principle, his rash alliance with a party who were opposed to\r\nall that he had learned to respect in childhood; and whom he joined,\r\nfrom the stimulus of a misdirected ambition, cannot be justified. To\r\nthis, it was generally believed, he was greatly incited by the\r\npersuasions of his mother-in-law, the Countess of Errol.\r\n\r\nWhilst we bestow our cordial approbation on those who engaged in civil\r\nstrife from a sense of duty, and from notions of allegiance, which had\r\nnever been exterminated from their moral code, we condemn such as,\r\nattaching themselves to the Jacobite party, outraged their secret\r\nconvictions, betrayed the trusts of Government, and violated the promise\r\nof their youth. Such a course must spring either from selfishness, or\r\nweakness, or from a melancholy union of both. In Lord Kilmarnock it was\r\nfar more the result of weakness than of self-interest: his fortunes were\r\ndesperate, and his mind was embittered towards the ruling government:\r\nhis admiration was attracted by the gallantry and resolution of those\r\nwho adhered to the Chevalier: his sense of what was due to his rank, and\r\nthe consciousness of high descent, coupled with empty honours and real\r\npoverty, stimulated him to take that course which seemed the most likely\r\nto regain a position, without ever enjoying which a man may be happy,\r\nbut which few can bear to lose. This was his original error; he joined\r\nthe standard of Charles Edward,--but he was no Jacobite. He fought\r\nagainst his own convictions, the hereditary and ineffaceable\r\nprepossessions implanted in the heart by a parent.\r\n\r\nFrom henceforth, until immured in the Tower, all in the career of Lord\r\nKilmarnock was turbulence; and, it must be acknowledged, crime. For\r\nnothing can justify a resistance of sovereign power, save a belief in\r\nits illegality. \"I engaged in the rebellion,\" was Lord Kilmarnock's\r\nconfession, \"in opposition to my own principles, and to those of my\r\nfamily; in contradiction to the whole tenor of my conduct.\" Such were\r\nhis expressions at that hour when no earthly considerations had power to\r\nseduce him into falsehood.\r\n\r\nBy those historians who espouse the Jacobite cause, this avowal has been\r\nseverely censured; and Lord Kilmarnock has been regarded as deserting\r\nthe party which he had espoused. But, with his conviction, such a line\r\nof conduct as that which he pursued in prison, could alone be honest,\r\nand therefore alone consistent with his religious hopes, before he\r\nquitted life. Such censure has been well answered in Lord Kilmarnock's\r\nown words, \"I am in little pain for the reflections which the\r\ninconsiderate or prejudiced part of my countrymen, (if there are any\r\nsuch whom my suffering the just sentence of the law has not mollified,)\r\nmay cast upon me for this confession. The wiser or more ingenious will,\r\nI hope, approve my conduct, and allow with me, that next to doing right\r\nis to have the courage and integrity to avow that I have done wrong.\"\r\nThese sentiments were not, be it observed, made public until after his\r\ndeath.\r\n\r\nIf, in early life, the career of Lord Kilmarnock were tainted by\r\ndissolute conduct, his deep contrition, his sincere confession of his\r\nerrors, his endeavours to amend them, redeem those very errors in the\r\neyes of human judgment, as they will probably plead for him, with One\r\nwho is more merciful than man. In his prison, his patience in suspense,\r\nhis forbearance to those who had urged on his death, his generous\r\nsentiments towards his companions in misfortune,--his care for others,\r\nhis trust in the mercy of his Saviour, present as instructive a lesson\r\nas mortals can glean from the errors and the penitence of others.\r\n\r\nContrasted with the gentle, unfortunate Kilmarnock, the gallant bearing\r\nof Balmerino rises to heroism. One cannot, for the sake of his party,\r\nhelp regretting that he had not taken a more prominent part in the\r\ncouncils of the young Chevalier, or held a more distinguished position\r\nin the field. His integrity, his strong sense, and moral courage might\r\nhave had an advantageous influence over the wavering, and confirmed the\r\nindecisive. In the field, his would have been the desperate valour which\r\nsuits a desperate cause; but his resources were few, and his influence\r\nproportionately small.\r\n\r\nThe soldier of fortune, driven at an early age from home, sent from\r\ncountry to country, serving, with little hope of advancement, under\r\nvarious generals, Balmerino had learned to view life almost as a matter\r\nof indifference, compared with the honest satisfaction of preserving\r\nconsistency. His existence had been one of trial, and of banishment from\r\nall domestic pleasures, and in the perils of his youthful days, he had\r\nlearned to view it as so precarious, that his final doom came not to him\r\nas a surprise, but seemed merely a natural conclusion of a career of\r\ndanger and adventure. His heroism may excite less admiration even than\r\nthe resignation of those who had more to lose; but his intrepidity, his\r\ncourageous sincerity, his contempt of all display, his carelessness of\r\nhimself, and the tender concern which he evinced for others, are\r\nqualities which we should not be _English_ not to appreciate and\r\nvenerate. His were the finest attributes of the soldier and the\r\nJacobite: the firm, unflinching adherence; the enthusiastic loyalty; the\r\nutter repugnance to all compromising; and the lofty disregard of\r\nopinion, which extorted, even from those who endeavoured to ridicule, a\r\nreluctant respect.\r\n\r\nFor the relentless pretext of what was called justice, which sent this\r\nbrave man to his doom, there is no possibility of accounting, except in\r\nthe deep party hatred of the Government. Lord Kilmarnock is believed to\r\nhave owed his death to the false report industriously spread of his\r\nhaving treated the English prisoners with cruelty; but no such plea\r\ncould injure Balmerino. One dark influence, at that time all powerful at\r\ncourt, all powerful among the people, denied them mercy;--and the crowds\r\nwhich witnessed the death of Kilmarnock and of Balmerino, hastened to do\r\nhomage to the Duke of Cumberland. Nothing can, in fact, more plainly\r\nshow the effect of frequent executions upon the character of a people\r\nthan the details of the year 1746. With the inhabitants of London, like\r\nthe French at the time of the Revolution, the value of life was lowered;\r\nthe indifference to scenes of horror formed a shocking feature in their\r\nconduct. In the great world, jests, and witticisms delighted the\r\nSatellites of power. It was the barbarous fashion to visit Temple Bar\r\nfor the purpose of viewing the heads exhibited there; spying glasses\r\nbeing let out for the ghastly spectacle. And the coarse, unfeeling\r\ninvectives of the press prove the general state of the public mind, in\r\nthose days, more effectually than any other fact could do:--in the\r\npresent times, the cruelty which pursues its victim to the grave would\r\nnot be tolerated.\r\n\r\nIn his latest hours, the chief concern of Lord Kilmarnock seems to have\r\nbeen for his eldest son, to whom he addressed the following beautiful\r\nletter.\r\n\r\n\r\nEXTRACT OF THE LATE EARL OF KILMARNOCK'S LETTER TO HIS SON LORD BOYD.\r\n\r\n                                \"Dated, Tower, 17th of August, 1746.\r\n\r\n    \"Dear Boyd,\r\n\r\n    \"I must take this way to bid you farewell, and I pray God may ever\r\n    bless you and guide you in this world, and bring you to a happy\r\n    immortality in the world to come. I must, likewise, give you my last\r\n    advice. Seek God in your youth, and when you are old He will not\r\n    depart from you. Be at pains to acquire good habits now, that they\r\n    may grow up, and become strong in you. Love mankind, and do justice\r\n    to all men. Do good to as many as you can, and neither shut your\r\n    ears nor your purse to those in distress, whom it is in your power\r\n    to relieve. Believe me, you will find more joy in one beneficent\r\n    action; and in your cool moments you will be more happy with the\r\n    reflection of having made any person so, who without your assistance\r\n    would have been miserable, than in the enjoyment of all the\r\n    pleasures of sense (which pall in the using), and of all the pomps\r\n    and gaudy show of the world. Live within your circumstances, by\r\n    which means you will have it in your power to do good to others.\r\n    Above all things, continue in your loyalty to his present Majesty,\r\n    and the succession to the crown as by law established. Look on that\r\n    as the basis of the civil and religious liberty and property of\r\n    every individual in the nation. Prefer the public interests to your\r\n    own, wherever they interfere. Love your family and your children,\r\n    when you have any; but never let your regard to them drive you on\r\n    the rock I split upon; when, on that account, I departed from my\r\n    principles, and brought the guilt of rebellion, and civil and\r\n    particular desolation on my head, for which I am now under the\r\n    sentence justly due to my Prince. Use all your interest to get your\r\n    brother pardoned and brought home as soon as possible, that his\r\n    circumstances, and bad influence of those he is among, may not\r\n    induce him to accept of foreign service, and lose him both to his\r\n    country and his family. If money can be found to support him, I wish\r\n    you would advise him to go to Geneva, where his principles of\r\n    religion and liberty will be confirmed, and where he may stay till\r\n    you see if a pardon can be procured him. As soon as Commodore Burnet\r\n    comes home, inquire for your brother Billie, and take care of him on\r\n    my account. I must again recommend your unhappy mother to you.\r\n    Comfort her, and take all the care you can of your brothers: and may\r\n    God of His infinite mercy, preserve, guide, and comfort you and them\r\n    through all the vicissitudes of this life, and after it bring you to\r\n    the habitations of the just, and make you happy in the enjoyment of\r\n    Himself to all eternity!\"\r\n\r\n\r\nPAPER DELIVERED BY THE LATE EARL OF KILMARNOCK TO MR. FOSTER.\r\n\r\n                                      \"Sunday, 17th of August, 1746.\r\n\r\n    \"As it would be a vain attempt in me to speak distinctly to that\r\n    great concourse of people, who will probably be present at my\r\n    execution, I chose to leave this behind me, as my last solemn\r\n    declaration, appealing for my integrity to God, who knows my heart.\r\n\r\n    \"I bless God I have little fear of temporal death, though attended\r\n    with many outward circumstances of terror; the greatest sting I feel\r\n    in death is that I have deserved it.\r\n\r\n    \"Lord Balmerino, my fellow-sufferer, to do justice, dies in a\r\n    professed adherence to the mistaken principles he had imbibed from\r\n    his cradle. But I engaged in the Rebellion in opposition to my own\r\n    principles, and to those of my family; in contradiction to the whole\r\n    tenour of my conduct, till within these few months that I was\r\n    wickedly induced to renounce my allegiance, which ever before I had\r\n    preserved and held inviolable. I am in little pain for the\r\n    reflection which the inconsiderate or prejudiced part of my\r\n    countrymen (if there are any such, whom my suffering the just\r\n    sentence of the law has not mollified,) may cast upon me for this\r\n    confession.\r\n\r\n    \"The wiser, or more ingenious, will, I hope, approve my conduct, and\r\n    allow with me that, next to doing right, is to have the courage and\r\n    integrity to own that I have done wrong.\r\n\r\n    \"Groundless accusations of cruelty have been raised and propagated\r\n    concerning me; and charges spread among the people of my having\r\n    solicited for, nay, even actually signed orders of general savage\r\n    destruction, seldom issued among the most barbarous nations, and\r\n    which my soul abhors. And that the general temper of my mind was\r\n    ever averse from, and shocked at gross instances of inhumanity, I\r\n    appeal to all my friends and acquaintance who have known me most\r\n    intimately, and even to those prisoners of the King's troops to whom\r\n    I had access, and whom I ever had it in my power to relieve; I\r\n    appeal, in particular, for my justification as to this justly\r\n    detested and horrid crime of cruelty, to Captain Master, of Ross,\r\n    Captain-Lieutenant Luon, and Lieutenant George Cuming of Alter.\r\n\r\n    \"These gentlemen will, I am persuaded, as far as relates to\r\n    themselves, and as far as has fallen within their knowledge as\r\n    credible information, do me justice; and then, surely my countrymen\r\n    will not load a person, already too guilty and unfortunate, with\r\n    undeserved infamy, which may not only fix itself on his own\r\n    character, but reflect dishonour on his family.\r\n\r\n    \"I have no more to say, but that I am persuaded, if reasons of\r\n    state, and the demands of public justice had permitted his Majesty\r\n    to follow the dictates of his own royal heart, my sentence might\r\n    have been mitigated. Had it pleased God to prolong my life, the\r\n    remainder of it should have been faithfully employed in the service\r\n    of my justly offended sovereign, and in constant endeavours to wipe\r\n    away the very remembrance of my crime.\r\n\r\n    \"I now, with my dying breath, beseech Almighty God to bless my\r\n    rightful sovereign, King George, and preserve him from the attacks\r\n    of public and private enemies.\r\n\r\n    \"May his Majesty, and his illustrious descendants, be so guided by\r\n    the Divine Providence as ever to govern with that wisdom, and that\r\n    care for the public good, as will preserve to them the love of their\r\n    subjects, and secure their right to reign over a free and happy\r\n    people to the latest posterity.\"\r\n\r\nThat Lord Boyd reciprocated the affection of his father appears from the\r\nfollowing letter, which he addressed, a few days after the execution of\r\nLord Kilmarnock, to Colonel Walkinshaw Craufurd, who was then at\r\nScarborough.\r\n\r\n    \"My Dear John,\r\n\r\n    \"I had yours last post, and I don't know in what words to express\r\n    how much I am obliged to you for doing the last duties to my\r\n    unfortunate father; you can be a judge what a loss I have suffered;\r\n    you knew him perfectly well, that he was the best of friends, the\r\n    most affectionate husband, and the tenderest parent. Poor Lady\r\n    Kilmarnock bears her loss much better than I could have imagined;\r\n    but it was entirely owing to her being prepared several days before\r\n    she got the melancholy accounts of it. I shall be here for some\r\n    time, as I have a good deal of business to do in this country; so I\r\n    shall be extremely glad to see you as soon as possible. I am, my\r\n    dear John, your most sincere friend and obedient humble servant,\r\n\r\n                                                              BOYD.\"\r\n\r\n    \"Kilmarnock (House) August 27th, 1746.\"\r\n\r\nYet the young nobleman did not, it appears, entirely satisfy the\r\nexpectations of those who were interested in his fate, and attached to\r\nhis father's memory, as the following extract from a letter written by\r\nMr. George Rosse, to Colonel Craufurd, shows.[395]\r\n\r\n    \"Dear Sir,\r\n\r\n    \"I am favoured with yours of the thirteenth from Scarborough, and\r\n    had the honour of one letter from Lord Boyd since his father's\r\n    execution, and sorry to tell you, it was not wrote in such terms as\r\n    I could show or make any use of. If you had seen him, I dare say it\r\n    would have been otherwise. However, I took the liberty of writing\r\n    with plainness to him, in hopes of drawing from him, what may be\r\n    shown to his honour and to his own immediate advantage.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n    \"I put him in mind of writing to his cousin, Duke of Hamilton, and\r\n    Mr. Home; an omission, which, with submission, is unpardonable, as\r\n    he was apprised of their goodness to his father; and I gave him some\r\n    hints with relation to himself, by authority of the ministry, which,\r\n    if he continue in the army, may be improved upon. Those things I\r\n    think proper to mention to you, as I know your friendship for Boyd,\r\n    that you may take an opportunity of mentioning them to him, when you\r\n    are with him, which I hope will be soon. He is appointed deputy\r\n    Captain-Lieutenant; but that I look upon as a step to higher\r\n    preferment. I should like to hear from you; direct to (Crawfurdland)\r\n    Kilmarnock, and I am, dear sir, your most obedient, humble servant.\r\n\r\n                                                       \"GEO. ROSSE.\"\r\n\r\n        Leicesterfield,\r\n    September 8th, 1746.\r\n\r\nNotwithstanding these seeming acts of negligence, which may possibly\r\nhave been explained, Lord Boyd became, in every way, worthy of being\r\nthe representative of an ancient race. He was an improved resemblance of\r\nhis amiable, unhappy father. Possessing his father's personal\r\nattributes, he added, to the courtesy and kindliness of his father's\r\ncharacter, strength of principle, a perfect consistency of conduct, and\r\nsincere religious connections, both in the early and latter period of\r\nhis life. His deportment is said to have combined both the sublime and\r\nthe graceful; his form, six feet four inches in height, to have been the\r\nmost elegant; his manners the most polished and popular of his time. In\r\nhis domestic relations he was exemplary, systematic, yet with the due\r\nliberality of a nobleman, in his affairs; sagacious and conscientious as\r\na magistrate; generous to his friends. \"He puts me in mind,\" said one\r\nwho knew him, \"of an ancient hero; and I remember Dr. Johnson was\r\npositive that he resembled Homer's character of Jaspedon.\"[396] \"His\r\nagreeable look and address,\" observes that adorer of rank, Boswell,\r\n\"prevented that restraint, which the idea of his being Lord High\r\nConstable of Scotland might otherwise have occasioned.\"[397]\r\n\r\nAt the time of his father's execution, Lord Boyd was only twenty years\r\nof age. He claimed and obtained the maternal estate, and obtained it in\r\n1751. In 1758 he succeeded Mary, Countess of Errol in her own right, his\r\nmother's aunt, as Earl of Errol, and left the army in which he had\r\ncontinued to serve. He retired to Slains Castle, where he passed his\r\ndays in the exercise of those virtues which become a man who is\r\nconscious, by rank and fortune, of a deep responsibility, and who\r\nregards those rather as trusts, than possessions. He died at\r\nCalendar-house, in 1778, universally lamented, and honoured.\r\n\r\nThe Countess of Kilmarnock survived her husband only one year; and died\r\nat Kilmarnock in 1747. Two sons were, however, left, in addition to Lord\r\nBoyd, to encounter, for some years, considerable difficulties. Of these,\r\nthe second, Charles, who was in the insurrection of 1745, escaped to the\r\nIsle of Arran, where he lay concealed, in that, the ancient territory of\r\nthe Boyds, for a year. He amused himself, having found an old chest of\r\nmedical books, with the study of medicine and surgery, which he\r\nafterwards practised with some degree of skill among the poor. He then\r\nescaped to France, and married there a French lady; but eventually he\r\nfound a home at Slains Castle, where he was residing when Dr. Johnson\r\nand Boswell visited Scotland. He was a man of considerable\r\naccomplishment; but, as Boswell observed, \"with a pompousness or formal\r\nplenitude in his conversation,\" or as Dr. Johnson expressively remarked,\r\n\"with too much elaboration in his talk.\" \"It gave me pleasure,\" adds\r\nBoswell, \"to see him, a steady branch of the family, setting forth all\r\nits advantages with much zeal.\"\r\n\r\nWilliam Boyd, the fourth son of Lord Kilmarnock, was in the Royal Navy,\r\nand on board Commodore Burnet's ship at the time of his father's\r\nexecution. He was eventually promoted to a company of the 14th foot, in\r\n1761.\r\n\r\nLord Balmerino left no descendants to recall the remembrance of his\r\nhonest, manly character. His wife, Margaret Chalmers, survived him\r\nnearly twenty years, and died at Restalrig, on the 24th of August, 1765,\r\naged fifty-six.\r\n\r\nThe remains of these two unfortunate noblemen were deposited under the\r\ngallery, at the west end of the chapel in the Tower. Beside them repose\r\nthose of Simon, Lord Lovat. \"As they were associates in crime, so they\r\nwere companions in sepulchre,\" observes a modern writer, \"being buried\r\nin the same grave.\"[398] But the more discriminative judge of the human\r\nheart will spurn so rash, and undiscerning a remark; and marvel that, in\r\nthe course of one contest, characters so differing in principle, so\r\nunlike in every attribute of the heart, and viewed, even by their\r\nenemies, with sentiments so totally opposite, should thus be mingled\r\ntogether in their last home.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[316] Wood's Peerage.\r\n\r\n[317] Who, adds the same authority, carried azure, a fess cheque, argent\r\nand gules: and for their crest, a hand issuing out of a wreath, pointing\r\nwith the thumb and two fingers: motto, _confido_; supporters, two\r\nsquirrels collared or.\r\n\r\n[318] Reay, 203.\r\n\r\n[319] Reay, 203.\r\n\r\n[320] Wood's Peerage.

It is\r\nconceived that the late Act of Parliament, empowering his Majesty to\r\ntransport such as are taken in arms from one county to another, where\r\nthey may be tried by the course of the common law, did not take place\r\ntill after that time, that the facts implying treason, were actually\r\ncommitted by the accused prisoners, and if so, the Grand Jury of Surrey,\r\nor of any other county whatsoever, where these acts of treason are not\r\nalleged to have been committed, could not, agreeable to law, find bills\r\nagainst such prisoners; and it may, on that score, be prayed, That the\r\nindictment be quashed, or that an arrest of judgment be thereupon\r\ngranted.\" What a bitter, though unavailing feeling of regret accompanies\r\nthe reflection that this benevolent attempt to save the lives of these\r\nbrave men, was fruitless.\r\n\r\n[372] Letters to Sir H.

The original is in the\r\npossession of Martin Paterson, Esq. of Kilmarnock, and is endorsed \"Copy\r\nof the last Instructions of Lord Kilmarnock to his factor, Mr. Robert\r\nPaterson.\"\r\n\r\n[384] Statement.\r\n\r\n[385] Statement.\r\n\r\n[386] Mrs. Howison Craufurd, the lady of William Howison Craufurd, Esq.,\r\nof Craufurdland Castle, Ayrshire. To this Lady I am indebted for much of\r\nthe information (afforded by her admirable letters) which has been\r\nintroduced into this Memoir of Lord Kilmarnock. To this lady I addressed\r\nan inquiry respecting an original portrait of Lord Kilmarnock. Her\r\nefforts to obtain any intelligence of one have been wholly unavailing;\r\nand we have been led to the conclusion that, in the fire at Dean Castle,\r\nall the portraits of Lord Kilmarnock must have been destroyed; his\r\nresemblance, his name, his honour, and his Castle thus becoming extinct\r\nat once. At Craufurdland Castle there is a fine portrait of Lord\r\nKilmarnock's brother, his widow and daughter, painted in oils, after a\r\nsingular fashion, black and white; giving it a ghastly hue. This perhaps\r\naccounts for the local tradition near Kilmarnock, \"that on hearing of\r\nhis brother's death, Mr. Boyd's colour fled, and never returned; nor was\r\nhe ever seen to smile again.\" A tradition not difficult of belief.\r\n\r\nThe present Mr. Craufurd, of Craufurdland Castle, represents also the\r\nfamily of Howison of Brae-head. In Mrs. Howison Craufurd's family an\r\namusing circumstance relative to Lord Lovat occurred. He was one evening\r\nin a ball-room, and was paying court to the great-grandmother of that\r\nlady. As he was playfully examining, and holding in his hand her diamond\r\nsolitaire, a voice whispered in his ear, \"that Government officers were\r\nin pursuit of him; and that he must decamp.\" Decamp he did, taking with\r\nhim, _perhaps_ by accident, the costly jewel. The young lady was in the\r\ngreatest trepidation, and her family were resolved to recover the\r\nornament. Many years after, on his return from France, Lovat, whose\r\ncharacter, in _no_ respect, rose above suspicion, was taxed with the\r\nrobbery, and refunded a sum which gave twenty pounds to each of a host\r\nof granddaughters, then in their girlhood.\r\n\r\n[387] In a letter from Mrs. Craufurd of Craufurdland to the author, this\r\nfact is stated. It is mentioned as traditionary elsewhere, but is\r\nattested by the family.\r\n\r\n[388] H. Walpole, vol. ii. p. 167.\r\n\r\n[389] H.

I must\r\n    acknowledge I did a very inconsiderate thing, for which I am\r\n    heartily sorry, in accepting a company of Foot from the Princess\r\n    Anne, who I know had no more right to the Crown than her predecessor\r\n    the Prince of Orange.... To make amends for what I had done I joined\r\n    the ... (Pretender) when he was in Scotland in 1715, and when all\r\n    was over I made my escape, and lived abroad till the year 1734.\r\n\r\n    \"In the beginning of that year I got a letter from my father which\r\n    very much surprised me; it was to let me know he had a promise of a\r\n    remission for me. I did not know what to do; I was then, (I think,)\r\n    in the canton of Berne, and had nobody to advise with: but next\r\n    morning I wrote a letter to the ...

(the Pretender's son)\r\n    came to Edinburgh I joined him, though I might easily have excused\r\n    myself from taking arms on account of my age; but I never could have\r\n    had peace of conscience if I had stayed at home.... I am at a loss\r\n    when I come to speak of the ... (Pretender's son,) I am not a fit\r\n    hand to draw his character, I shall leave that to others. (Here he\r\n    gives a fulsome character of the Pretender's son.)\r\n\r\n    \"Pardon me if I say, wherever I had the command, I never suffered\r\n    any disorders to be committed, as will appear by the Duke of\r\n    Buccleugh's servants at East Park; by the Earl of Findlater's\r\n    minister, Mr. Lato, and my Lord's servant, A. Cullen; by Mr. Rose,\r\n    minister at Nairn, (who was pleased to favour me with a visit when I\r\n    was prisoner at Inverness;) by Mr. Stewart, principal servant to the\r\n    Lord President at the House of Culloden; and by several other\r\n    people. All this gives me great pleasure, now that I am looking upon\r\n    the block on which I am ready to lay down my head; and though it\r\n    would not have been my own natural inclination to protect everybody,\r\n    it would have been my interest to have done it for ...

I have heard since I came to this place, that\r\n    there has been a most wicked report spread, and mentioned in several\r\n    of the newspapers that ... (the Pretender's son) before the battle\r\n    of Culloden, had given out orders that no quarter should be given to\r\n    the enemy. This is such an unchristian thing, and so unlike ... (the\r\n    Pretender's son,) that nobody (the Jacobites) that knows him will\r\n    believe it. It is very strange if there had been any such orders,\r\n    that neither the Earl of Kilmarnock, who was Colonel of the regiment\r\n    of the Foot Guards, nor I, who was Colonel of the second troop of\r\n    Life Guards, should ever have heard anything of it; especially since\r\n    we were both at the head-quarters the morning before the battle; I\r\n    am convinced that it is a malicious report industriously spread\r\n    to....\r\n\r\n    \"Ever since my confinement in the Tower, when Major White or Mr.\r\n    Fowler did me the honour of a visit, their behaviour was always so\r\n    kind and obliging to me that I cannot find words to express it; but\r\n    I am sorry I cannot say the same thing of a General Williamson: he\r\n    has treated me barbarously, but not quite so ill as he did the\r\n    Bishop of Rochester; and had it not been for a worthy clergyman's\r\n    advice, I should have prayed for him in the words of David, Psalm\r\n    109, from the 6th to the 15th verse. I forgive him and all my\r\n    enemies. I hope you will have the charity to believe I die in peace\r\n    with all men; for yesterday, I received the Holy Eucharist from the\r\n    hands of a clergyman of the Church of England, in whose communion I\r\n    die as in union with the Episcopal Church of Scotland.\r\n\r\n    \"I shall conclude with a short prayer.\"--(Here a prayer is mentioned\r\n    much the same as in Wm.

He was the younger brother of James Earl of Derwentwater, who\r\nsuffered in 1716, for his adherence to the Stuart cause. There was also\r\nanother elder brother, Francis, who died unmarried, not taking any\r\napparent interest in the politics of the day.\r\n\r\nThe family of Radcliffe were not regarded by the descendants of their\r\ncommon ancestor, Charles the Second, in the light of kindred whom the\r\nrules of decorum, and the usages of society might induce them to\r\ndisclaim, or at all events, to acknowledge with shame or reluctance; the\r\nvitiated notions of the day attached a very different value to the\r\nparentage of royalty, even when associated with dishonour. The marriage\r\nof Sir Francis Radcliffe to the daughter of Mary Davis was that event\r\nwhich procured his elevation to the peerage; and this alliance, was\r\nconsidered as elevating the dignity of an ancient house.[399] The\r\nclosest ties of friendship united the Stuarts and the Radcliffes, even\r\nfrom their earliest infancy. Educated, as well as his elder brother,\r\nJames, chiefly at St. Germains, and with the Chevalier James Stuart, and\r\nbrought up in the Roman Catholic faith, Charles Radcliffe, owing to the\r\nnatural ardour of his disposition, imbibed much more readily than his\r\nbrother the strong party views which characterized the Jacobites as a\r\nbody.\r\n\r\nIn James, Earl of Derwentwater, the convictions of his faith, grounded\r\nas they are upon the belief of those great truths common to all\r\nChristians, worked healthfully; expanding the benevolence of his heart,\r\nteaching him mercy, moderation, and forbearance. On Charles, impetuous,\r\nzealous, stronger in intellect than his brother, but devoid of prudence,\r\nthe same mode of culture, the same precepts acted differently. He\r\nbecame, even in early life, violent in his opinions, until the horror of\r\nwhat he deemed error, amounted to bigotry. Henceforth his destiny was\r\nswayed by those fierce resentments towards the opposite party by which\r\nnot only his brother, but even the Chevalier himself, seem to have been\r\nso rarely actuated; a remarkable degree of moderation and candour\r\nraising the character of James Stuart, whilst Lord Derwentwater was the\r\ngentlest of opponents, the most honourable of foes.\r\n\r\nIn early life Charles Radcliffe appears to have been chiefly dependent\r\nupon his brother's kindness and bounty; whilst his pursuits and\r\ninclinations, characterized in a letter by Lord Derwentwater as his\r\n\"pleasures,\" were of an expensive description. But it was not long\r\nbefore other causes of concern besides want of money, or a love of\r\ndissipation began to disquiet those who were interested in the welfare\r\nof the Radcliffe family. About the year 1710, the young Earl of\r\nDerwentwater returned from the continent to his patrimonial property at\r\nDilstone, in Northumberland, accompanied by his brother Francis, and by\r\nCharles who either frequently visited him, or wholly resided with him at\r\nhis seat. During this period of the life of Charles Radcliffe, an\r\ninsight into the general state of the family is afforded by several\r\nletters, addressed by the Earl of Derwentwater to Lady Swinburne of\r\nCapheaton, whom he styles his \"cousin.\" The relationship between these\r\nfamilies originated in the marriage of Mrs. Lawson, daughter of Sir\r\nWilliam Fenwick of Meldon, after the death of her first husband, with\r\nFrancis, first Earl of Derwentwater, and grandfather of James Radcliffe,\r\nand of his brothers. Mrs. Lawson's daughter, Isabel, married Sir John\r\nSwinburne of Capheaton who was rescued from a singular fate by one of\r\nthe Radcliffe family. When a child, he was sent to a monastery in\r\nFrance, where a member of that family accidentally saw him, and\r\nobserving that he resembled the Swinburnes in Northumberland, he\r\ninquired his name, and how he came there? To these questions, the monks\r\nanswered that they knew not his name; a sum of money was sent annually\r\nfrom England to defray his expenses; but of all other particulars they\r\nwere wholly ignorant. On investigating the matter, it was found,\r\nhowever, that the child had been taught that his name was Swinburne; and\r\nthat circumstance, coupled with the mysterious disappearance of the heir\r\nof that family from Northumberland induced the superior of the convent\r\nto permit his return home, where he identified himself to be the son of\r\nJohn Swinburne and of Jane Blount, by the description which he gave of\r\nthe marks of a cat, and of a punchbowl, which were still in the\r\nhouse.[400] He was afterwards advanced by Charles the Second to the\r\ndignity of a baronet.\r\n\r\nTo Mary, the daughter of Anthony Englefield, of Whiteknights, Berks, and\r\nwife of Sir William Swinburne, of Capheaton, the son of that man whose\r\nchildhood has so romantic a story associated with it, the following\r\nletters are addressed. Of these, the first is written by the celebrated\r\nJohn Radcliffe, Physician to Queen Anne. Dr. Radcliffe was probably a\r\ndistant relation of the family, although no distinctive trace of that\r\nconnection appears: he was a native of Wakefield, near Yorkshire; but\r\nwhen these letters were written, he had attained the highest eminence in\r\nhis profession that could be secured by one man; and was in the\r\npossession of wealth which he eventually employed in the foundation of\r\nthe Radcliffe Library, at Oxford.[401] The \"Mr. Radcliffe\" to whom he\r\nrefers, and to whose malady his skill was called upon to administer, was\r\nColonel Thomas Radcliffe, the uncle of Lord Derwentwater: the patient\r\nwas at the time suffering from mental delusion, in consequence of a\r\nfever.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHESE TO SIR WILLIAM SWINBURNE AT CAPHEATON.\r\n\r\n                                                       Dec. 6, 1709.\r\n\r\n    \"Sir,\r\n\r\n    \"Yours I received, and am very glad to hear that yourself and my\r\n    lady is in so good health. I hope in a short time Mr. Radcliffe will\r\n    be so too. He is recovered; but he had such a severe fever that he\r\n    continues weak still. My Lord Derwentwater and his brother\"\r\n    (Francis) \"and Mr. Fenwick, are all come safe from Holland, and are\r\n    very well, and we shall drink your health together this night.

My most humble service to your lady\r\n    and the rest of the good family, and I wish you a merry Christmas;\r\n    and that I might be so happy as to take a share of it with you,\r\n    would be a great satisfaction to him who is your most obliged and\r\n    most faithful, humble servant,\r\n\r\n                                                   \"JOHN RADCLIFFE.\"\r\n\r\nThe next letter is from Sir William Swinburne to his lady; in this he\r\nspeaks of the pleasure with which Lord Derwentwater had returned to\r\nDilstone, the seat of his ancestors, which he was, in so few short\r\nyears, to forfeit.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO MY LADY SWINBURNE, AT CAPHEATON.\r\n\r\n                                            Beaufort, 7th Feb. 1710.\r\n\r\n    \"Dear Love!\r\n\r\n    \"My Lord\" (Derwentwater) \"is very well pleased with Dilstone, and\r\n    says it answers all that he has heard of it: but is resolved to\r\n    build a new house, though Roger Fenwick told him he thought his\r\n    lordship need not alter a stone of it.

He received us very well: but is yet unease about those people\r\n    that disturb him, and he says that he must go down to Newcastle by\r\n    sea, or else he will never get quitte of them. This is an ode fancy;\r\n    but I believe we shall comply with it, for the doctor dous not sime\r\n    very averce to it, and was for sending Joseph back with him; but I\r\n    have taken the horse into my stable, for I feared it mit hurt the\r\n    horse to return so soon.

I would have Sir William let me know by the\r\n    next post whether he will have the horse or the money. I shall have\r\n    the honor to whrit to him very soon.\"\r\n\r\nThe two following epistles, one from Lady Derwentwater, the other from\r\nthe Earl, speak of married happiness, alloyed, not only by the\r\ndistempered fancies of an invalid uncle, but by the melancholy accounts\r\nof a brother's behaviour. It does not, however, appear certain which of\r\nthe brothers, whether Francis or Charles, was thus alluded to.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOR THE HONOURABLE LADY SWINEBURNE, JUNIOR, AT CAPHEATON.\r\n\r\n                                                 \"Hadcross, Aug. 17.\r\n\r\n    \"I have manny thanks to returne your ladyship for the favour of your\r\n    letter and oblidging congratulations.

Adieu!\"\r\n\r\nIn May 1714, only one year before the fatal insurrection of 1715 broke\r\nout, the following letter, referring to different members of his family,\r\nwas written by the Earl. What a pleasing picture of an affectionate\r\nnature does this correspondence afford.[403]\r\n\r\n\r\nFOR MY LADY SWINBURNE, JUNIOR, AT CAPHEATON.\r\n\r\n                                          \"Kathcrosse, May, 6, 1714.\r\n\r\n    \"Now I write with pleasure to your ladyship, since I hope to be so\r\n    happy as to enjoy your good companie in a few months, I mean\r\n    immediately after York Races, for my two years will be out here the\r\n    tenth of July. Indeed Sir John has behaved himself wonderfully well\r\n    to us quite the holl time, really performing in everything more than\r\n    I could have expected from a man of honnor, as indeed I had reason\r\n    to believe him. My lady is not of so steady a temper; but however,\r\n    we agree very well: and she is mighty fond of my wife, which I take\r\n    very kindly, since as yet we are but one. Never any body could be so\r\n    desirous to goe to the North as my wife is, especially just comming\r\n    from the divertions of London, except your ladyship or myself, who\r\n    longs to be established there, that we may at least be out of the\r\n    way of such inhuman proceedings as we saw, upon all accounts, this\r\n    year at London. My poor dear uncle's case may serve for one\r\n    instance. After getting the better in all the courts, and, that\r\n    lastly, the Lord Chancellor and eleven Judges had given there decree\r\n    in favor of Will. Constable, and my uncle, a factious party, most\r\n    young rakes, have reversed the decree, and given it for Roper, by a\r\n    divition of fifty-three against twenty-three torrys, who were\r\n    resolute enough to appear in a good cause, being forsaken by their\r\n    brethren, who were afraid to be caled favourers of Poperie. I long\r\n    to hear what my uncle will say to this news. If he be well, it will\r\n    nettle him in spite of resignation. Gibson writes word they are at\r\n    Doway; but he does not know when my uncle will sett forwards. I do\r\n    not know where to wish him: for I really don't know how he is. For\r\n    in one letter Gibson writes, he tells me my uncle is as well as ever\r\n    he was in his life; and at the end of the letter he tells me his\r\n    honnor is afraid of being pursude. 'Tis certain my uncle writes in\r\n    another stille than usuall: for, in letters of business he\r\n    continually mentions God Almighty, the Blessed Virgin, and the\r\n    Saints. All I say is, God send him over a comfort to his friends,\r\n    which he must be if he is well. Brother Frank is recovered, but is\r\n    the very same man. Brother Charles is mighty uneasie: he is no\r\n    ritcher, though I doe what I can to help him in his pleasures.\r\n\r\n    \"Pray my duty to my uncle and aunt, to whom I will write soon, and\r\n    kind services to all other relations.\r\n\r\n    \"If your ladyship will tell Tom Errington that I have executed the\r\n    leases, and that I wonder cousin Tom Errington is not in for a\r\n    quarter part of Redgroves, and that, supposing there were some such\r\n    valuable reason as my cousin Tom's not being willing to accept of\r\n    it, or having resigned it to one of those mentioned in the lease,\r\n    which by the bye I should take very ill, then that lease of\r\n    Redgrove's may stand good: but otherways I would have the lease\r\n    altered, and my cousin Tom Errington to come in for a quarter part,\r\n    as I promised him he should. In letting him know this, your ladyship\r\n    will oblige your humble and obedient servant and kinsman,\r\n\r\n                                                      \"DERWENTWATER.\r\n\r\n    \"My dear wife presents her humble service to your ladyship, and\r\n    desires the same may be made acceptable to all with you. We expect\r\n    Lord Wald and my lady to make my sister happy, who will do the same\r\n    by them.\"\r\n\r\nThe felicity which Lord Derwentwater enjoyed was of brief duration.\r\nAccording to tradition among his descendants, he was urged on to those\r\nsteps which ended in his death by the violent counsels of his brother\r\nCharles, whose impetuosity the unfortunate earl often regretted,\r\nexpressing, in his private correspondence, how much his rash and\r\nintemperate spirit distressed and alarmed him. Of the progress, and the\r\nprincipal features of the insurrection of 1715, and of the part which\r\nLord Derwentwater took in that event, an account has already been\r\ngiven.[404] \"Happy,\" observes the biographer of Charles Radcliffe, \"had\r\nit been for him, happy for his lady, and happy for his family, had the\r\nearl staid at home, and suffered himself to be withheld from that fatal\r\nexpedition.\"[405]\r\n\r\nCharles Radcliffe was at that time twenty-two years of age; he had no\r\nexperience in military affairs, but was full of spirit and courage,\r\nready to offer himself for every daring, and even hopeless enterprise,\r\nand seeming to set no value on his life where honour was to be won. Such\r\na character soon became popular with the leaders of the movement in the\r\nnorth; and Lord Derwentwater gave the conduct of his tenantry into his\r\nbrother's hands, Captain Shaftoe commanding under Mr. Radcliffe.\r\n\r\nThe behaviour of this young commander throughout the whole of the\r\nexpedition was consistent with this character of intrepidity; but that\r\nwhich surprised many persons in a man who had never before engaged in\r\nwar, was the judgment, as well as courage, which he displayed. And\r\nperhaps, had his counsels been followed, the result of that ill-starred\r\nrising, in which so many brave men perished, might have been less\r\ndisastrous to the party whom he espoused. When the insurgents were at\r\nHexham, and intelligence was brought that General Carpenter was\r\napproaching, Mr. Radcliffe proposed that the Jacobite troops should go\r\nout and fight the English before they had recovered from their long\r\nmarch; but his opinion was overruled. His was that description of mind\r\nwhich gleans much from observation; he studied the countenances of those\r\naround him, and formed his own conclusion of their characters. When any\r\nfalse alarm happened to be given that the king's troops were near, it\r\nwas his practice, undaunted himself, to watch the countenances of his\r\nofficers, when they were ordered to head their corps, and march against\r\nthe enemy. Some of them, he observed, turned pale, and looked half-dead\r\nwith fear; the eyes of others flashed with fire and fury: on these, he\r\nwas certain that a dependence might be placed in the time of action,\r\nwhilst he forbore from placing the others in any post of responsibility.\r\nNor were his own party the only subjects of his curiosity. Until this\r\neventful period of his life, he had seen but little of the world, \"and\r\nnow,\" observes his biographer, \"he fancied himself on his travels.\" He\r\ntherefore passed over no object of interest cursorily; at every town he\r\nvisited, he inquired what were the customs of the place--what monuments\r\nof celebrated men, or other objects of antiquity were to be found there;\r\nand of these he made written notes; whilst in the council and the camp,\r\nhe studied the tempers and passions of men.\r\n\r\nWhen, upon the forces arriving at Hawick, the Highlanders mutinied, and\r\ngoing to the top of a rising ground declared that they would not stir a\r\nstep farther, but would march with Lord Wristoun to the west of\r\nScotland, Mr. Radcliffe thought their views reasonable, and advocated\r\nthe endeavour to strike a bold stroke in Scotland, and to aim at the\r\nentire conquest of that kingdom. His opinion, which events justified,\r\nwas overruled, and the leaders of his party were resolute in continuing\r\ntheir fatal and rash project of proceeding to England. Mr. Radcliffe, on\r\nfinding that his representations were ineffectual, begged that he might\r\nhave an hundred horse given to him, that with them he might try his\r\nfortune with the Highlanders: this was also denied him, for fear of\r\nweakening the force; and he was constrained to proceed with his\r\nconfederates in arms to Preston.\r\n\r\nIn the action at that place, Mr. Radcliffe behaved with a heroism that\r\ndeserved a happier fate. It was a fine sight to behold him and his\r\nbrother Lord Derwentwater, endeavouring to animate their men, by words\r\nand example, and maintaining their ground with unequalled bravery,\r\nobliging the king's forces to retire. During the action Mr. Radcliffe\r\nencountered the utmost danger, standing in the midst of the firing, and\r\ndoing as much duty as the lowest soldiers in the ranks. But his life was\r\nspared only to encounter a more disastrous termination, after a long and\r\nwearisome exile. When, being invested on all sides by the enemy, the\r\ninsurgents proposed a capitulation, the gallant young man exclaimed,\r\n\"that he would rather die, with his sword in his hand, like a man of\r\nhonour, than be dragged to the gallows, there to die like a dog.\" These\r\nexclamations fell unheeded; and he was obliged to submit with the rest;\r\nsoon afterwards, this fine, high-spirited youth, was carried to Newgate,\r\nthere to await his trial, in company with his companions in error and\r\nmisfortune.\r\n\r\nIn Newgate, Mr. Radcliffe witnessed a scene of desperation, accompanied\r\nwith the ordinary circumstances of licentiousness, and reckless misery,\r\nwhich, unchecked by adequate regulations, the prisons of that day\r\nafforded. Until after the execution of Lord Derwentwater and of Lord\r\nKenmure had taken place, hopes of a reprieve sustained the unhappy\r\nprisoners in Newgate, and, \"flaunting apparel, venison pasties,\" wine,\r\nand other luxuries, for which they paid an enormous price, were the\r\nordinary indulgences of those who were incarcerated in that crowded\r\nreceptacle.[406]\r\n\r\nContributions were made from many different quarters for the prisoners;\r\nand the friends of the \"rebels\" were observed to be also very generous\r\nto the turnkeys. Numbers of ladies visited the prison, and a choice of\r\nthe most expensive viands was daily proffered by the lavish kindness of\r\ntheir fair enthusiasts. Of course much scandal followed upon the steps\r\nof this dangerous and costly kindness; and escapes were facilitated,\r\nperhaps, not without connivance on the part of Government. On the\r\nfourteenth of March an attempt was made by some of these unfortunate\r\npeople to get out of the press-yard, by breaking through a part of the\r\nwall, from which they were to be let down by a rope; but they were\r\ndiscovered, and, in consequence, heavily ironed. Nevertheless, on the\r\ntwenty-third of March almost all of the prisoners were released from\r\ntheir fetters, an indulgence which was a proof of the lenity of the\r\nGovernment, as the ordinary keepers of the prison would not have dared\r\nto have allowed it.[407] After this, Mr. Forster and others amused\r\nthemselves with the game of shuttlecock, at which, relates the author of\r\nthe Secret History of the Rebels in Newgate, the \"valiant Forster beat\r\nevery one who engaged him: so that he triumphed with his feathers in the\r\nprison, though he could not do it in the field.\" On the tenth of April\r\nthat gentleman made his escape: and henceforth, a lieutenant, with\r\nthirty of the Foot Guards, was ordered to do constant duty at Newgate.\r\nMeantime, crowded as the building was, a spotted fever broke out, and\r\nseemed likely to relieve the civil authorities from no small number of\r\nthe unfortunate prisoners.\r\n\r\nOn the eighth of May, Mr. Radcliffe was arraigned at the Exchequer Bar,\r\nat Westminster, for High Treason: to this he pleaded not guilty. In a\r\nfew days afterwards he was brought there again, and tried upon the\r\nindictment; he had no plea to offer in his defence, and was found\r\nguilty.\r\n\r\nHe soon afterwards was carried to Westminster, accompanied by eleven\r\nother prisoners, to receive sentence of death. They were conveyed in six\r\ncoaches to the Court. As the coach in which Mr. Radcliffe was seated,\r\ndrove into Fleet Street, it encountered the state carriage in which\r\nGeorge the First, who was then going to Hanover for the first time\r\nsince his accession, was driving. This obliged Mr. Radcliffe's coach to\r\nstop; and, perceiving that he was opposite to a distiller's shop, he\r\ncalled for a pint of aniseed, which he and a fellow-prisoner, with a\r\nservant of Newgate, drank, and then proceeded to Westminster.\r\n\r\nMr. Radcliffe was several times reprieved; and it was thought he might\r\nhave been pardoned; but affrighted, perhaps, by his brother's fate, and\r\nprobably weary of imprisonment, he now began to project a plan of\r\nescape, to which he was emboldened by the great success of several\r\nsimilar attempts. Greater vigilance was, indeed, resorted to in the\r\nprison, after the flight of Brigadier Mackintosh, who had knocked down\r\nthe turnkey, and ran off through the streets: and all cloaks,\r\nriding-hoods, and arms, were prohibited being brought in by the visiters\r\nwho came to visit the prisoners. It is amusing to hear, that a certain\r\nform of riding-hoods acquired, at this time, the name of a Nithsdale, in\r\nallusion to the escape of the Earl of Nithsdale.[408]\r\n\r\nOn the day appointed for Mr. Radcliffe's escape, the prisoners gave a\r\ngrand entertainment in Newgate: this took place in a room called the\r\nCastle, in the higher part of the prison. Mr. Radcliffe, when the party\r\nwere at the highest of their mirth, observing a little door open in the\r\ncorner of the room, passed through it followed by thirteen of the\r\nprisoners; and succeeded in finding their way, unmolested, to the\r\ndebtor's side, where the turnkey, not knowing them, and supposing them\r\nto be visiters to the prisoners, allowed them to pass on. Mr. Radcliffe\r\nwas dressed in mourning, and had, according to his own subsequent\r\naccount to a fellow prisoner in Newgate, a \"brown tye-wig.\" In this way,\r\nwithout any disguise, but wearing his ordinary attire, did he escape,\r\nleaving within the prison walls, his friend, Basil Hamilton, nephew of\r\nthe Duke of Hamilton, who, as it was deposed on his trial, was his chum,\r\nor companion, living with him in a room, the windows of which looked\r\nupon the garden of the College of Physicians. After remaining concealed\r\nfor some time, Mr. Radcliffe took the first opportunity of getting a\r\npassage to France.[409] He lived, for many years, in Paris, in great\r\npoverty, tantalized with promises of assistance from the French Court,\r\nyet witnessing the ungenerous treatment of the Chevalier by that Court.\r\nHis nephew, John Radcliffe, who was killed accidentally, assisted him\r\nwith remittances in 1730 for some time, and James Stuart gave him a\r\nsmall pension: his difficulties and privations must have been\r\nconsiderable; yet they never lessened his ardour in the cause for which\r\nhe had sacrificed every worldly advantage.\r\n\r\nEither to amend his ruined fortunes, or to gratify a passion long\r\nunrequited, Mr. Radcliffe was resolved upon marriage. The object of his\r\nhopes was Charlotte Maria, Countess of Newburgh, the widow of Hugh, Lord\r\nClifford of Chudleigh, and the mother of two daughters by that nobleman.\r\nThis lady was about a year older than himself, being born in 1694. It is\r\na tradition in the family of Lord Petre, the lineal descendant of\r\nJames, Earl of Derwentwater, that Charles Radcliffe offered his hand\r\ntwelve times to the Countess of Newburgh, and was as often refused.\r\nWearied by his importunity, Lady Newburgh at last forbade him the house.\r\nBut the daring character of Mr. Radcliffe, and his strong will,\r\nsuggested an expedient, and he was resolved to obtain an interview. To\r\ncompass this end, he actually descended into an apartment in which the\r\nCountess was sitting, through the chimney; and taking her by surprise,\r\nobtained her consent to an union. Of the truth of this curious\r\ncourtship, there is tolerably good evidence, not only in the belief of\r\nthe Petre family, but from a picture representing the fact, which is at\r\nThorndon.[410] The nuptials took place at Brussels, in the church of the\r\nVirgin Mary, on the twenty-fourth of June, 1724,[411] and in 1726, James\r\nBartholomew, who became, after the death of his mother, third Earl of\r\nNewburgh, was born at Vincennes.[412]\r\n\r\nLady Newburgh had every reason, as far as prudence could be allowed to\r\ndictate to the affections, for her reluctance to a marriage with Mr.\r\nRadcliffe. He was, at this time, an outlawed man, with a sentence of\r\ndeath passed upon him, and no hope could ever be revived of his\r\nregaining, even after the death of his nephew, the family honours and\r\nestates. Yet, in the ardour and fearlessness of Charles Radcliffe's\r\ncharacter there must have been much to compensate for those\r\ncircumstances, and to win the fancy of the young. There seems no reason\r\nto suppose that the union thus strangely formed was infelicitous; and\r\nindeed, from family documents, it is evident that the family so marked\r\nout by fate for sorrow, were happy in their mutual affection. Of the two\r\ndaughters of Lady Newburgh's first marriage, Anna, the eldest, was\r\nmarried to the Count de Mahony, whose descendants, the Gustiniani might\r\nclaim the title of Newburgh, were they not debarred by being born\r\naliens. Another was Frances, who died unmarried. This lady is mentioned\r\nin a letter written by Charles Radcliffe, recently before his death,\r\nwhen he was confined to the Tower, with peculiar affection, as \"that\r\nother tender mother of my dear children.\"[413]\r\n\r\nIn the year 1733, Mr. Radcliffe visited England, and resided several\r\nmonths in Pall Mall; yet the ministry did not consider it necessary to\r\ntake any notice of his return, nor, probably, would they ever have\r\nconcerned themselves on that subject, had not a second insurrection\r\nbrought the unfortunate man into notice. In 1735, he again returned, and\r\nendeavoured by the mediation of friends to procure a pardon, but was\r\nunsuccessful in that attempt.[414]\r\n\r\nIrritated, perhaps, by that refusal, and still passionately attached to\r\nthe cause which he had espoused; undeterred by the execution of his\r\nbrother, or by the sufferings of his friends, from mixing himself in the\r\nturmoils of a second contest, Charles Radcliffe, on the breaking out of\r\nthe insurrection of 1745, again ventured his life on the hazard. He had\r\nno lands to lose, no estates to forfeit; but he had all to gain; for the\r\ndeath of his nephew made him the head of the unfortunate house of\r\nRadcliffe. After that event, he assumed the title of Earl of\r\nDerwentwater, and it was of course assigned to him at the court of St.\r\nGermains, and indeed always insisted upon by him; but the estates were\r\nalienated, and there appeared no hope under the present government of\r\never recovering those once enviable possessions. Under these\r\ncircumstances, Mr. Radcliffe was naturally a likely object for the\r\nrepresentations of the sanguine, or the intrigues of the designing to\r\nwork upon; and in this temper of mind he met, in the year 1743, with\r\nJohn Murray of Broughton, at Paris, where that gentleman remained three\r\nweeks; and became intimately acquainted with Mr. Radcliffe, who is\r\ndescribed among others, as a \"wretched dependant on French pensions,\r\nwith difficulty obtained, and accompanied with contempt in the payment.\"\r\n\r\nWhile the fashionable world were diverting themselves with epigrams upon\r\nthe Rebellion, a small expedition was fitted out, consisting of twenty\r\nFrench officers, and sixty Scotch and Irish, who embarked at Dunkirk on\r\nboard the Esperance privateer; among these was Charles Radcliffe and his\r\neldest son. At this time nothing was spoken of in London except the\r\ndaring attempt in Scotland,--sometimes in derision,--sometimes in\r\nserious apprehension: \"the Dowager Strafford,\" writes Horace Walpole\r\n(Sept. 1745), \"has already written cards for my Lady Nithesdale, my Lady\r\nTullebardine, the Duchess of Perth and Berwick, and twenty more revived\r\npeeresses, to invite them to play at whist, Monday three months: for\r\nyour part, you will divert yourself with their old taffetys, and\r\ntarnished slippers, and their awkwardness the first day they go to Court\r\nin clean linen.\"[415] \"I shall wonderfully dislike,\" observes the same\r\nwriter, \"being a loyal sufferer in a threadbare coat, and shivering in\r\nan attic chamber at Hanover, or reduced to teach Latin and English to\r\nthe young princes at Copenhagen. Will you ever write to me in my garret\r\nat Herenhausen? I will give you a faithful account of all the promising\r\nspeeches that Prince George and Prince Edward make whenever they have a\r\nnew sword, and intend to reconquer England.\"\r\n\r\nOne of the first adverse circumstances that befel the Jacobites in 1745,\r\nwas the capture of the vessel in which Mr. Radcliffe hoped to reach the\r\nshores of Scotland. It was taken during the month of November by the\r\nSheerness man-of-war; and Mr. Radcliffe and his son were carried to\r\nLondon and imprisoned in the Tower.\r\n\r\nOn the twenty-first of November he was conveyed, under a strong guard\r\nfrom the Tower, to Westminster; he was brought to the bar, by virtue of\r\na Habeas Corpus, and the record of his former conviction and attainder\r\nwas at the same time removed there by Certiorari. These being read to\r\nhim, the prisoner prayed that counsel might be allowed him; and named\r\nMr. Ford and Mr. Jodrel, who were accordingly assigned to him as\r\ncounsel. A few days were granted to prepare the defence, and on the\r\ntwenty-fourth of the month the prisoner was again brought up; he\r\npleaded that he was not the person named in the record, who was\r\ndescribed as Charles Radcliffe, but maintained that he was the Earl of\r\nDerwentwater. He also requested that the trial might be put off, that\r\ntwo witnesses, one from Brussels, the other from St. Germains, might be\r\nsummoned. This was refused. The prisoner then challenged one of the\r\njury, but that challenge was overruled. During these proceedings the\r\nlofty, arrogant manner, and the vehement language of Mr. Radcliffe drew\r\nfrom his counsel the remark that he was disordered in his senses. The\r\njudge, Mr. Justice Foster, who tried the case, bore his contemptuous\r\nconduct with great forbearance. When brought into Court, to be\r\narraigned, he would neither hold up his hand, nor plead, insisting that\r\nhe was a subject of France, and appealing to the testimony of the\r\nNeapolitan Minister, who happened to be in Court. But not one of these\r\nobjections was allowed, and the trial proceeded.\r\n\r\nNo fresh indictment was framed, and the point at issue related merely to\r\nthe identity of the prisoner. The award in Mr. Radcliffe's case was\r\nagreeable to the precedent in the case of Sir Walter Raleigh, and\r\nexecution was awarded on his former offence, judgment not being again\r\npronounced, having been given on the former arraignment. This mode of\r\nproceeding might be law, but no one after the lapse of thirty years, and\r\nthe frequent communications of the prisoner with the English Government,\r\ncan regard such a proceeding as _justice_: and, as in the case of Sir\r\nWalter Raleigh, it brought odium upon the memory of James the First, so\r\nit excited in the reign of George the Second almost universal\r\ncommiseration for the sufferer, and disgust at the course adopted.\r\n\r\nThe evidence in this case was far from being such as would be accepted\r\nin the present day.\r\n\r\nTwo Northumberland men were sworn to the fact that the prisoner at the\r\nbar was the younger brother of the Earl of Derwentwater, and that they\r\nhad seen him march out from Hexham, in Northumberland, at the head of\r\nfive hundred of Lord Derwentwater's tenantry; they recognized him, as\r\nthey declared, by a scar on his face; they had been to see him in the\r\nTower, to refresh their memories, and could swear to him, as Charles\r\nRadcliffe, brother of the Earl of Derwentwater. After this deposition,\r\nRoger Downs, a person who had acted in the capacity of barber to the\r\nState prisoners, in 1715, was called.\r\n\r\nTo him Mr. Radcliffe thus addressed himself:[416] \"I hope, sir, you have\r\nsome conscience; you are now sworn, and take heed what you say.\"\r\n\r\nTo this Downs replied; \"I shall speak nothing but the truth. I well\r\nremember that I was appointed close shaver at Newgate, in the year 1715\r\nand 1716, when the rebels were confined there, and shaved all those who\r\nwere close confined.\"\r\n\r\nThe Counsel then asked, \"Pray, sir, did you shave Charles Radcliffe,\r\nEsquire, the late Earl of Derwentwater's brother, who was confined in\r\nNewgate for being concerned in the rebellion in the year 1715, or who\r\nelse did you shave of the said rebels at that time? And pray, sir, who\r\nwas keeper, or who were turnkeys of the said gaol of Newgate.\"\r\n\r\nThe answer of Downs was couched in these words, \"William Pitt, Esq. was\r\nhead keeper, and Mr. Rouse, and Mr. Revel, were head turnkeys, who\r\nappointed my master to be barber, to shave the prisoners; and I attended\r\nin my master's stead, and used to go daily to wait on the rebel\r\nprisoners, and I particularly remember that I shaved Basil Hamilton, a\r\nreputed nephew of the late Duke of Hamilton, and Charles Radcliffe,\r\nEsq., brother to the late Earl of Derwentwater, who I perfectly remember\r\nwere chums, or companions, in one room, in the press-yard, in Newgate,\r\nthat looked into the garden of the College of Physicians, and for which\r\nservice I was always very well paid.\"\r\n\r\nThe Counsel then desired him to look at the prisoner and inform the\r\nCourt if that gentleman were the very same Charles Radcliffe that he\r\nshaved in Newgate, at the aforesaid time, and who after escaped out of\r\nNewgate.\r\n\r\nTo this Downs returned the following reply: \"I cannot on my oath say he\r\nis.\"\r\n\r\nThen the head keeper of Newgate was called, and he produced the books\r\nbelonging to the gaol, wherein were the names of Charles Radcliffe, and\r\nother rebels, who had been condemned, and were respited several times.\r\nThis gentleman said, that the books produced then in Court were in the\r\nsame condition that he found them: but as to the person of the prisoner\r\nhe knew nothing, his confinement having taken place several years before\r\nhe belonged to the gaol.\r\n\r\nAbraham Mosely, a servant of the head keeper, was then called, but he\r\nwas not sworn; another gentleman was afterwards brought to the bar; as\r\nthe book was handed to him to be sworn, Mr. Radcliffe, looking earnestly\r\nat him, inquired what book it was that he was going to be sworn upon:\r\nthe officer answered it was the New Testament. Mr. Radcliffe replied,\r\n\"He is no Christian, and believes neither in God nor devil.\" The\r\nevidence of this witness, whose name is suppressed, was, however,\r\nreceived, and it seems not to have been inconsistent with his alleged\r\ncharacter. It was the disclosure of a confidential conversation on the\r\npart of Mr. Radcliffe, who had imparted to the witness in what manner he\r\nhad escaped from Newgate in 1715. The witness was asked whether the\r\nprisoner was drunk when he made this confession: he answered that he\r\nwas. Then being asked if he were drunk himself, he replied that he never\r\ngot drunk; upon which Mr. Radcliffe said hastily, that \"some people\r\nwould get drunk if at free cost.\"\r\n\r\nThe prisoner examining no witnesses, the Chief Justice summed up the\r\ncase, and in ten or fifteen minutes the jury, who had retired, brought\r\nin a verdict of guilty. A Rule was then made for the proper writ for the\r\nexecution of the prisoner, on the eighth of December, and he was\r\nremanded to the Tower. When informed by the Court of the time fixed for\r\nhis doom, Mr. Radcliffe said he wished they had given him a longer time,\r\nthat so he might have been able to acquaint some people in France, and\r\nthat his brother, the Earl of Morton, and he might \"have set out on\r\ntheir journey together.\"\r\n\r\nThe unhappy Mr. Radcliffe returned to his prison. Much has been written\r\nof the arrogance and intemperance of his conduct and language, but much\r\nmust be allowed for the subservience of the contemporary writers, as\r\nwell as for the irritated feelings of the man. Considering himself as a\r\nnobleman, and meeting with disrespect, and, perhaps, harsh usage, a\r\nquick temper was aggravated almost to madness. To his inferiors the\r\npassion and pride of his character were so offensive that the warders of\r\nthe Tower could be scarcely induced to give him their attendance; and\r\nthis inconvenience was the more severely felt as a man named McDermont,\r\nwho had been his equerry for twenty-three years, was sent to Newgate on\r\nthe very day when Mr. Radcliffe entered the Tower.\r\n\r\nAt the hour of his last earthly trial, this man, whose eventful and\r\nsingular life was brought to a close at the age of fifty-three, redeemed\r\nthe errors of the last few weeks of anguish, and of bitter\r\ndisappointment. He submitted calmly to his doom. The sullen sorrow, and\r\nthe intolerable haughtiness of his manner, were exchanged for a\r\ncomposure, solemn and affecting, and for a courtesy which well became\r\nthe brother of Lord Derwentwater.\r\n\r\nBetween eight and nine on the morning of the eighth of December, the\r\nSheriff, driving in a mourning coach to the east gate of the Tower,\r\ndemanded the prisoner. The gate was opened, and in about ten minutes a\r\nlandau, in which Mr. Radcliffe was seated, drove out at the east gate,\r\ntowards Little Tower Hill. He was accompanied by the Under-Sheriffs, and\r\nby the officers of the Tower: the landau was surrounded by a party of\r\nFoot Guards, with their bayonets fixed. The street was lined with horse\r\nsoldiers, from the iron gate of the Tower, to the scaffold, which was\r\nencompassed also with horse soldiers. At the foot of the stairs of the\r\nscaffold a booth was erected, for the reception of the prisoner.\r\n\r\nLike Lord Balmerino, Mr. Radcliffe wore his regimentals, which were\r\nthose of the French army; and consisted of a scarlet coat, with gold\r\nbuttons, the sleeves faced with black velvet; a scarlet waistcoat,\r\ntrimmed with gold lace; and white silk stockings. His hat was encircled\r\nwith a white feather.\r\n\r\nAs the prisoner alighted from the landau, he saw some of his friends\r\nstanding near the booth; he paid his compliments to them with the grace\r\nof a well-bred man; and, smiling, asked of the sheriffs, who had\r\npreceded him in the mourning-coach, \"if he was to enter the booth?\" He\r\nwas answered in the affirmative. \"It is well,\" he replied; and he went\r\nin, and there passed about ten minutes in his devotions.\r\n\r\nThe scaffold had been provided early that morning with a block, covered\r\nwith black, a cushion, and two sacks of sawdust; and the coffin of the\r\nunhappy prisoner, also covered with black, was placed on the stage.\r\n\r\nMr. Radcliffe ascended the scaffold with great calmness, and asked for\r\nthe executioner. \"I am but a poor man,\" said the unfortunate man, \"but\r\nthere are ten guineas for you: if I had more, I would give it you; do\r\nyour execution so as to put me to the least possible misery.\" He then\r\nkneeled down, and folding his hands, uttered a short prayer. He arose,\r\nand was then assisted by two of the warders in the last preparations for\r\nhis doom, taking off his coat and waistcoat, and substituting for his\r\nwig a white cap. Having taken a respectful leave of the sheriffs, he was\r\nabout to kneel down, when it was discovered that it would be necessary\r\nto tuck back the collar of his shirt. That office was performed by the\r\nexecutioner. Then, after saying a short prayer, and crossing himself\r\nseveral times, he laid his head upon the block. In less than half a\r\nminute afterwards, he gave the signal, by spreading out his hands: his\r\nhead was severed at one blow, and the body fell upon the scaffold. The\r\nexecutioner, searching his pockets, found in them a silver crucifix, his\r\nbeads, and half-a-guinea. No friend attended the man who had been so\r\nlong exiled from his own country, on the scaffold; but four undertakers'\r\nmen stood, with a piece of red cloth, to receive the head of the\r\nill-fated Charles Radcliffe. His body, being wrapt in a blanket, was put\r\ninto the coffin, with his head, and conveyed to the Nag's Head, in\r\nGray's Inn Lane, and thence, in the dead of the night, to Mr.\r\nWalmsbey's, North Street, Red Lion Square, whence it was removed to be\r\ninterred in the church-yard of St. Giles's-in-the-Fields, where a\r\nneglected stone alone marks his burial-place. The following is the\r\ninscription on the coffin:--\"Carolus Radcliffe, comes de Derwentwater,\r\ndecollatus, die 8vo. Decembris, 1746, aetatis 53.\" To this were added the\r\nwords, so appropriate to the close of an adventurous life, \"Requiescat\r\nin pace.\"\r\n\r\nDesolate as these last hours appear to have been, and uncheered by the\r\npresence of a friend, some tender care was directed to the remains of\r\nthe unfortunate sufferer. His head was afterwards sewn on to the body by\r\na dependant of Lord Petre's family, a woman of the name of Thretfall,\r\nwhose grandson, a carpenter, who lived for many years at Ingatestone\r\nHall, Essex, a seat of Lord Petre's, used to relate to the happier\r\nchildren of a later generation (the descendants of James, Earl of\r\nDerwentwater), the circumstances, of which he had heard in his\r\nchildhood. The Countess of Newburgh was afterwards buried by the side of\r\nher husband; and the sexton of St. Giles's Church, some years since, on\r\nthe lid of the coffin giving way, perceived some gold lace in a state of\r\npreservation; so that it seems probable that the blanket in which the\r\nbleeding remains were removed, was superseded by the costly and military\r\nattire worn by the prisoner.\r\n\r\nPrevious to his death Mr. Radcliffe wrote to his family. His letters,\r\nand all the memorials of his brother, and of himself, have been\r\nsedulously preserved by the family to whom they have descended. Lady\r\nAnna Maria Radcliffe, the only daughter of James, Earl of Derwentwater,\r\nmarried in 1732, James, eighth Baron Petre, of Writtle, county Essex. A\r\nconnexion had already subsisted between the families, a sister of Lord\r\nDerwentwater having married a Petre of the collateral branch, seated at\r\nBelhouse, in Essex, which branch is now extinct.\r\n\r\nLady Anna Radcliffe appears to have entertained the deepest reverence\r\nfor her father's memory, and to have held all that belonged to him, or\r\nthat related to his fate, sacred. She caused a large mahogany chest to\r\nbe made to receive the clothes which he wore on the scaffold, and also\r\nthe covering of the block; likewise, a cast of his face taken after\r\ndeath: and having deposited these relics in the chest, she added a\r\nwritten paper with her seal and signature, _Anne Petre_, authenticating\r\nthe said apparel and documents, and solemnly forbidding any of her\r\ndescendants or other persons to make use of the chest for any other\r\npurpose, but \"to contain her father's clothes, unless some other\r\nreceptacle more costly be by them provided.\" This box is deposited in a\r\nroom at Thorndon Hall, with letters and papers relating both to _James_,\r\nLord Derwentwater, and to his brother _Charles_.\r\n\r\nThe eldest son of Mr. Radcliffe, called the Lord Kinnaird, in right of\r\nthe Barony of Kinnaird, remained a prisoner in the Tower at the time of\r\nhis father's execution; and the uncertainty of that young man's fate\r\nmust greatly have added to the distress of his father. In the spring of\r\n1746, he was suffered to return to France, on a cartel, an exchange of\r\nprisoners including him as a native of France. The circumstance to which\r\nthe youth owed his long imprisonment, was a report which gained ground\r\nthat he was the second son of James Stuart, Henry Benedict, whom the\r\nEnglish political world believed, at that time, to be on the eve of\r\ngoing to Ireland, and under this impression, the mob followed the young\r\nman as he was conveyed from the vessel to the Tower with insults. Before\r\nreturning to France, he was received by the Duke of Richmond, his\r\nmother's relative, with great consideration, and entertained at what\r\nHorace Walpole terms \"a great dinner.\"[417] Such was what the same\r\nauthor calls the _Stuartism_ in some of the highest circles.\r\n\r\nLord Kinnaird afterwards put in a claim for the reversion of the\r\nDerwentwater estate, but without success, for it had already been sold\r\nby the Commissioners. A scene of iniquitous fraud, in the sale of the\r\nforfeited estate belonging to Lord Derwentwater was afterwards detected\r\nby Lord Gage, for which Dennis Bond, Esquire, and Sergeant Birch,\r\nCommissioners of the sale, were expelled the House.[418] In 1749, an Act\r\nwas passed vesting the several estates of James, Earl of Derwentwater in\r\ntrustees, for the benefit of Greenwich Hospital; but, out of the funds\r\nthus arising, 30,000_l._ was appropriated to the widowed Countess of\r\nNewburgh, and the interest of the remaining 24,000_l._, was to be paid\r\nto James Bartholomew, Lord Kinnaird, during his life, and after his\r\ndeath the principal to revert to his eldest son.[419] From the\r\nChevalier, the widowed Countess of Newburgh received, as the following\r\nletter will shew, much kindness and sympathy; the conduct of James to\r\nhis fallen and powerless adherents, appears to have been almost\r\ninvariably marked by compassion and generosity. The Countess of Newburgh\r\nsurvived her husband ten years, during which time the affection of the\r\nChevalier, and of his sons, for her husband's memory was evinced by\r\nkindness to his widow, as the following letter testifies:--\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLADY DERWENTWATER TO THE CHEVALIER DE ST. GEORGE.[420]\r\n\r\n    Sir,\r\n\r\n    I received the honour of our Majesty's most gracious letter, and beg\r\n    leave to return my grateful thanks. Your Majesty is very good in\r\n    commending my dear Lord who did but his duty: he gave his life most\r\n    willingly for your Majesty's service, and I am persuaded that your\r\n    Majesty never had a subject more attacht to his duty than he was.\r\n    The Prince of Wales and the Duke of York have been so good to show a\r\n    great concern for my loss, and recommended most strongly to the King\r\n    of France my famyly. His Majesty has been most extremely good and\r\n    gracious to them. My son, that was Captain in Dillon's, has now the\r\n    Brevet of Colonel reform'd with appointments of 1800 livres a-year;\r\n    his sisters have 150 livres a-year each of them, with his royal\r\n    promis of his protection of the famyly for ever. The Marquise de\r\n    Mezire, and her daughter the Princess de Monteban have been most\r\n    extremely friendly to my famyly in this affair.\r\n\r\n    I am, your Majesty's most dutyfull subject,\r\n\r\n                                             CHARLOTTE DERWENTWATER.\r\n        St. Germains,\r\n    February, ye 10th, 1747.\r\n\r\nOf the Countess's two younger sons, one, James Clement Radcliffe, an\r\nofficer in the French service, survived till 1788, the other, who bore\r\nhis father's name, Charles, died in 1749. Three of her daughters died\r\nunmarried, but Lady Mary, the fourth, married Francis Eyre, Esq., of\r\nWalworth Castle, Northamptonshire. On the failure of the issue of three\r\nsons, in 1814 the title of Newburgh passed into the family of Eyre\r\nthrough the marriage of the above Mary, and devolved upon Francis Eyre,\r\nthe grandson of Charlotte Countess of Newburgh, and of Charles\r\nRadcliffe, father of the present Earl of Newburgh.\r\n\r\nBy the marriage of Lady Anne Radcliffe, the only daughter of James, Earl\r\nof Derwentwater, in 1732, to Robert James, eighth Baron Petre, the\r\npresent Lord Petre is the rightful representative of that attainted\r\nnobleman, being the third in direct descent from Lady Anne Radcliffe,\r\nwhose only brother, John,[421] was killed accidentally abroad, having\r\nnever been married.[422]\r\n\r\nIn concluding this account of the unfortunate Charles Radcliffe, a\r\nreflection naturally arises in the mind, how different would have been\r\nthe spirit of administration in the present day to that which the\r\ngovernment of that period displayed:--how great would have been the\r\nhorror of shedding the blood of honourable and valiant men; how\r\nuniversal the sentiment of mournful commiseration; and how strong the\r\nconviction, that men, so true to an ill fated cause, would have been\r\nfaithful to any engagements which required them to abandon their efforts\r\nin that cause; had clemency, but too imperfectly understood in those\r\nturbulent and merciless times, excited their gratitude, and for ever\r\nensured their fidelity.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[399] \"Genuine and Impartial Memoirs of the Life and Character of\r\nCharles Radcliffe, wrote by a Gentleman of the Family, (Mr. Eyre,) to\r\nprevent the public being imposed on by any erroneous or partial\r\naccounts, to the prejudice of this unfortunate gentleman.\" London,\r\nprinted for the Proprietor, and sold by E.

(See p. 280,\r\nvol. i.) Into this error I was betrayed by an obscure passage in Burke's\r\nExtinct Peerage.\r\n\r\nI am indebted to the Hon.

His body was\r\nprivately removed to Dagenham Park, in Essex, a house his Countess had\r\nhired in order to be near London. A report, meanwhile, was circulated by\r\nhis friends that he had been buried in St. Giles's; and, when no further\r\ndanger of tumult was to be apprehended, the remains of the Earl were\r\ndeposited with his ancestors in the vaults of the chapel at Dilstone.\r\n\r\nThe mother of the present Mr. Howard, of Corby Castle, and sister of Sir\r\nThomas Neave, Bart., has often related to her young relations, that when\r\nshe and her sisters were children, they were afraid to pass at night\r\nalong the gallery at Dagenham, it being popularly supposed that Lord\r\nDerwentwater still walked there, carrying his head under his arm. This\r\nmust have been, at least, seventy years after his death.\r\n\r\n[422] See Appendix, No. 2, also note.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAPPENDIX\r\n\r\nNo. I.\r\n\r\n\r\nThis letter was addressed by the Rev. Joseph Spence, author of\r\n\"Polymetus,\" and of \"Spence's Anecdotes,\" and prebend of Durham, to his\r\nfather, who had forbidden him to enter into the society of the\r\nChevalier, at Rome.\r\n\r\nThe Rev. Joseph Spence left this letter, with other MSS. and books, to\r\nthe late Mrs. Coltman, mother of Samuel Coltman, Esq., of Darley Dale.\r\nIt is not dated, but undoubtedly refers to the Chevalier, James Stuart.\r\n\r\n    \"Sir,\r\n\r\n    \"About a month ago, Mr. ---- and I being in search of some of the\r\n    antiquities of your place, we became acquainted with an English\r\n    gentleman, very knowing in this kind of learning, and who proved of\r\n    great use to us; his name is Dr. Cooper, a priest of the Church of\r\n    England, whom we did not suspect to be of the Pretender's retinue,\r\n    but took him to be a curious traveller, which opinion created in me\r\n    a great liking for his conversation. On Easter eve, he made us the\r\n    compliment, that as he supposed us bred in the profession of the\r\n    said Church, he thought it incumbent on him to invite us to divine\r\n    service, next day being Easter Sunday. Such language, at Rome,\r\n    appeared to me a jest. I stared at the Doctor, who added that the\r\n    Pretender (whom he called king), had prevailed with the late pope,\r\n    to grant licence for having divine service according to the rules\r\n    of the Church of England, performed in his palace, for the benefit\r\n    of the Protestant gentlemen of his suite, his domestics, and\r\n    travellers; and that Dr. Berkley and himself were appointed for the\r\n    discharge of this duty; and that prayers were read as ordinarily\r\n    here as in London. I should have remained of St. Thomas's belief,\r\n    had I not been a witness that this is a matter of fact, and as such,\r\n    have noted it down, as one of the greatest wonders of Rome. This was\r\n    the occasion of my first entrance into the Pretender's house: I\r\n    became acquainted with both the Doctors, who are sensible, well-bred\r\n    men. I put several questions to them about the Pretender, and, if\r\n    credit can be given them, they assure me he is a moral, upright man,\r\n    being far from any sort of bigotry, and most averse to disputes and\r\n    distinctions of religion, whereof not a word is admitted in his\r\n    family. They described him in person very much to the resemblance of\r\n    King Charles II., which they say he approaches more and more every\r\n    day, with a great application to business, and a head well turned\r\n    that way, having only some clerks, to whom he dictates such letters\r\n    as he does not write with his own hand. In some days after, my\r\n    friend and I went to take the evening air, in the stately park\r\n    called Villa Ludovici, there we met, face to face, on a sudden, with\r\n    the Pretender, his Princess, and court; we were so very close before\r\n    we understood who they were, that we could not retreat with decency,\r\n    common civility obliged us to stand side-ways in the alley, as\r\n    others did, to let them pass by. The Pretender was easily\r\n    distinguished by his star and garter, as well as by his air of\r\n    greatness, which discovered a majesty superior to the rest. I felt\r\n    at that instant of his approach, a strange convulsion in body and\r\n    mind, such as I never was sensible of before, whether aversion, awe,\r\n    or respect occasioned it, I can't tell: I remarked his eyes fixed on\r\n    me, which, I confess, I could not bear--I was perfectly stunned, and\r\n    not aware of myself, when, pursuant to what the standers-by did, I\r\n    made him a salute; he returned it with a smile, which changed the\r\n    sedateness of his first aspect into a very graceful countenance; as\r\n    he passed by I observed him to be a well-sized, clean-limbed man. I\r\n    had but one glimpse of the Princess, which left me a great desire of\r\n    seeing her again; however, my friend and I turned off into another\r\n    alley, to reason at leisure on our several observations: there we\r\n    met Dr. Cooper, and, after making some turns with him, the same\r\n    company came again in our way. I was grown somewhat bolder, and\r\n    resolved to let them pass as before, in order to take a full view of\r\n    the Princess: she is of a middling stature, well-shaped, and has\r\n    lovely features: wit, vivacity, and mildness of temper, are painted\r\n    in her look. When they came to us, the Pretender stood, and spoke a\r\n    word to the Doctor, then looking at us, he asked him whether we were\r\n    English gentlemen; he asked us how long we had been in town, and\r\n    whether we had any acquaintance in it, then told us he had a house,\r\n    where English gentlemen would be very welcome. The Princess, who\r\n    stood by, addressing herself to the Doctor in the prettiest English\r\n    I think I ever heard, said, 'Pray, Doctor, if these gentlemen be\r\n    lovers of music, invite them to my concert, to-night; I charge you\r\n    with it;' which she accompanied with a salute in the most gracious\r\n    manner. It was a very hard task, sir, to recede from the honour of\r\n    such an invitation, given by a princess, who, although married to\r\n    the Pretender, deserves so much in regard to her person, her house,\r\n    and family. However, we argued the case with the Doctor, and\r\n    represented the strict orders we had to the contrary; he replied,\r\n    there would be no prohibition to a traveller against music, even at\r\n    the ceremonies of the Roman Catholic Church; that if we missed this\r\n    occasion of seeing this assembly of the Roman nobility, we might not\r\n    recover it while we stayed in Rome; and, that it became persons of\r\n    our age and degree to act always the part of gentlemen, without\r\n    regard to party humours. These arguments were more forcible than\r\n    ours, so we went, and saw a bright assembly of the prime Roman\r\n    nobility, the concert composed of the best musicians of Rome, a\r\n    plentiful and orderly collation served; but the courteous and\r\n    affable manner of our reception was more taking than all the rest.\r\n    We had a general invitation given us whilst we stayed in town, and\r\n    were desired to use the palace as our house, we were indispensably\r\n    obliged to make a visit next day, in order to return thanks for so\r\n    many civilities received;--those are things due to a Turk. We were\r\n    admitted without ceremony; the Pretender entertained us on the\r\n    subject of our families as knowingly as if he had been all his life\r\n    in England: he told me some passages of myself and father, and of\r\n    his being against the followers of King Charles I. and II., and\r\n    added, \"that if you, sir, had been of age before my grandfather's\r\n    death, to learn his principles, there had been little danger of your\r\n    taking party against the rights of a Stuart.\"\r\n\r\n    \"He then observed how far the prejudices of education and wrong\r\n    notions of infancy are apt to carry people from the paths of their\r\n    ancestors: he discoursed as pertinently on several of our\r\n    neighbouring families as I could do, upon which I told him I was\r\n    surprised at his so perfect knowledge of our families in England;\r\n    his answer was, that from his infancy he had made it his business to\r\n    acquire the knowledge of the laws, customs, and families of his\r\n    country, so that he might not be reported a stranger when the\r\n    Almighty pleased to call him thither. These and the like discourses\r\n    held until word was brought that dinner was served; we endeavoured\r\n    all we could to withdraw, but there was no possibility for it after\r\n    he had made us this compliment, \"I assure you, Gentlemen, I shall\r\n    never be for straining man's inclinations; however, our\r\n    grandfathers, who were worthy people, dined, and I hope there can be\r\n    no fault found that we do the same.\" There is every day a regular\r\n    table of ten or twelve covers well served, unto which some of the\r\n    qualified persons of his court, or travellers, are invited: it is\r\n    supplied with English and French cooking, French and Italian wines;\r\n    but I took notice that the Pretender eat only of the English dishes,\r\n    and made his dinner of roast-beef, and what we call Devonshire-pie:\r\n    he also prefers our March beer, which he has from Leghorn, to the\r\n    best wines: at the dessert, he drinks his glass of champagne very\r\n    heartily, and to do him justice, he is as free and cheerful at his\r\n    table as any man I know; he spoke much in favour of our English\r\n    ladies, and said he was persuaded he had not many enemies among\r\n    them; then he carried a health to them. The Princess with a smiling\r\n    countenance took up the matter, and said, \"I think then, Sir, it\r\n    would be but just that I drink to the cavaliers.\" Sometime after,\r\n    the Pretender begun a health to the prosperity of all friends in\r\n    England, which he addressed to me. I took the freedom to reply, that\r\n    as I presumed he meant his own friends, he would not take it ill\r\n    that I meant mine. \"I assure you, Sir,\" said he, \"that the friends\r\n    you mean can have no great share of prosperity till they become\r\n    mine, therefore, here's prosperity to yours and mine.\" After we had\r\n    eat and drank very heartily, the Princess told us we must go see her\r\n    son, which could not be refused; he is really a fine promising\r\n    child, and is attended by English women, mostly Protestants, which\r\n    the Princess observed to us, saying, that as she believed he was to\r\n    live and die among Protestants, she thought fit to have him brought\r\n    up by their hands; and that in the country where she was born, there\r\n    was no other distinction but that of honour and dishonour. These\r\n    women, and particularly two Londoners, kept such a racket about us\r\n    to make us kiss the young Pretender's hand that to get clear of them\r\n    as soon as we could, we were forced to comply: the Princess laughed\r\n    very heartily, and told us that she did not question but the day\r\n    would come that we should not be sorry to have made so early an\r\n    acquaintance with her son. I thought myself under a necessity of\r\n    making her the compliment, that being hers, he could not miss being\r\n    good and happy. On the next post day, we went, as commonly the\r\n    English gentlemen here do, to the Pretender's house for news. He had\r\n    received a great many letters, and after perusing them he told us\r\n    that there was no great prospect of amendment in the affairs of\r\n    England; that the Secret Committee and several other honest men were\r\n    taking abundance of pains to find out the cause of the nation's\r\n    destruction, which knowledge, when attained to, would avail only to\r\n    give the more concern to the public without procuring relief; for\r\n    that the authors would find means to be above the reach of the\r\n    common course of justice: he bemoaned the misfortune of England\r\n    groaning under a load of debts, and the severe hardships contracted\r\n    and imposed to support foreign interests: he lamented the\r\n    ill-treatment and disregard of the ancient nobility; and said it\r\n    gave him great trouble to see the interest of the nation abandoned\r\n    to the direction of a new set of people, who must at any rate enrich\r\n    themselves by the spoil of their country: \"some may imagine,\"\r\n    continued he, \"that these calamities are not displeasing to me,\r\n    because they may, in some measure, turn to my advantage; I renounce\r\n    all such unworthy thoughts.\"\"[423]\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTE:\r\n\r\n[423] The rest of the letter not being material, is omitted.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNo. II.--THE PEDIGREE OF THE DERWENTWATER FAMILY.

It was\r\ncopied by Alexander Macdonald, Esq., from an old process, in which it\r\nwas produced before the Court of Session, and it is preserved in the\r\nRegister House, Edinburgh; the signature, date, and address are,\r\nholographs of Lord Lovat.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE HONOURABLE THE GENTLEMEN OF THE NAME OF FRASER.\r\n\r\n    My dear Friends,\r\n\r\n    Since, by all appearances, this is the last time of my life I shall\r\n    have occasion to write to you, I being now very ill of a dangerous\r\n    fever, I do declare to you before God, before whom I must apear, and\r\n    all of us at the great day of Judgement, that I loved you all, I\r\n    mean you and all the rest of my kindred and family who are for the\r\n    standing of their chief and name; and, as I loved you, so I loved\r\n    all my faithful Commons in general more than I did my own life or\r\n    health, or comfort, or satisfaction; and God to whom I must answer,\r\n    knows that my greatest desire and the greatest happiness I proposed\r\n    to myself under heaven was, to make you all live happy and make my\r\n    poor Commons flourish; and that it was my constant principle to\r\n    think myself mutch hapier with a hundred pounds and see you all live\r\n    well at your ease about mee than have ten thousand pounds a year,\r\n    and see you in want or misery. I did faithfully desire and resolve\r\n    to make up, and put at their ease Allexander Fraser of Topatry, and\r\n    James Fraser of Castle Ladders and their familys; and whatever\r\n    disputs might ever be betwixt them and me which our mutual hot\r\n    temper occasioned, joyned with the malice and calomny of both our\r\n    ennemies, I take God to witness, I loved those two brave men as I\r\n    did my own life for their great zeal and fidelity they showed for\r\n    their chief and kindred; I did likewise resolve to support the\r\n    families of Struy Foyers and Culdithels families, and to the lasting\r\n    praise of Culdithel and his familie. I never knew himself to sarwe\r\n    from his faithfull zeal for his chief and kindred, nor none of his\r\n    familie, for which I hope God will bless him and them and their\r\n    posterity. I did likewise desyring to make my poor Commons live at\r\n    their ease and have them always well clothed and well armed after\r\n    the Highland maner, and not to suffer them to wear low country\r\n    cloths, but make them live like their forefathers with the use of\r\n    their arms, that they might always be in condition to defend\r\n    themselves against their ennemies, and to do service to their\r\n    friends, especially to the great Duke of Argile, and to his worthy\r\n    brother the Earl of Illay, and to that glorious and noble famyly who\r\n    were always our constant and faithful friends; and I conjure you and\r\n    all honest Frasers to be zealous and faithfull friends and servants\r\n    to the family of Argile and their friends, whilst a Campbell and a\r\n    Fraser subsists. If it be God's will that for the punishment of my\r\n    great and many sins and the sins of my kindred, I should now depart\r\n    this life before I put these just and good resolutions in execution;\r\n    yet I hope that God in his mercy will inspire you and all honest\r\n    Frasers to stand by and be faithfull to my cousin Inverlahie and the\r\n    other heirs male of my family, and to venture your lives and\r\n    fortunes to put him or my nearest heirs male named in my Testament\r\n    written by John Jacks, in the full possession of the estate and\r\n    honours of my forefathers, which is the onely way to preserve you\r\n    from the wicked designs of the family of Tarbat and Glengary joyned\r\n    to the family of Athol: and you may depend upon it, and you and your\r\n    posterity will see it and find it, that if you do not keep stedfast\r\n    to your chief, I mean the heir male of my famyly; but weakly or\r\n    falsely for little private interest and views abandon your duty to\r\n    your name, and suffer a pretended heiresse, and her Mackenzie\r\n    children to possess your country and the true right of the heirs\r\n    male, they will certainly in les than an age chasse you all by\r\n    slight and might, as well Gentlemen, as Commons, out of your native\r\n    country, which will be possessed by the Mackenzies and the\r\n    Mackdonalls, and you will be, like the miserable unnatural Jews,\r\n    scattered, and vagabonds throughout the unhappy kingdom of Scotland,\r\n    and the poor wifes and children that remains of the name, without a\r\n    head or protection when they are told the traditions of their\r\n    familie will be cursing from their hearts the persons and memory of\r\n    those unnaturall cowardly knavish men, who sold and abandoned their\r\n    chief, their name, their birthright, and their country, for a false\r\n    and foolish present gain, even as the most of Scots' people curs\r\n    this day those who sold them and their country to the English by the\r\n    fatal union, which I hope will not last long.\r\n\r\n    I make my earnest and dying prayers to God Almighty, that he may, in\r\n    his mercy, thro the merits of Christ Jesus, save you and all my poor\r\n    people, whom I always found honest and zealous to me and their duty,\r\n    from that blindness of heart that will inevitably bring those ruins\r\n    and disgraces upon you and your posterity; and I pray that Almighty\r\n    and Mercifull God, who has often miraculously saved my family and\r\n    name from utter ruin, may give you the spirit of courage, of zeal,\r\n    and of fidelity, that you owe to your chief, to your name, to your\r\n    selves, to your children, and to your country; and may the most\r\n    mercifull, and adorable Trinity, Father, Son and Holy Spirit, three\r\n    persons, one God, save all your souls eternally, throu the blood of\r\n    Christ Jesus, our Blessed Lord and Saviour, to whom I heartily\r\n    recommende you.\r\n\r\n    I desire that this letter may be kept in a box, at Beaufort, or\r\n    Maniack, and read once a-year by the heir male, or a principale\r\n    gentleman of the name, to all honest Frasers that will continue\r\n    faithfull to the duty I have enjoined in this above-written letter,\r\n    to whom, with you and all honest Frasers, and my other friends, I\r\n    leave my tender and affectionat blessing, and bid you my kind, and\r\n    last farewell.\r\n\r\n                                                              LOVAT.\r\n\r\n    London, the 5 of Aprile, 1718.\r\n\r\n    Not being able to write myself, I did dictat the above letter to the\r\n    little French boy, that's my servant. It contains the most sincere\r\n    sentiments of my heart; and if it touch my kindred in reading of it,\r\n    as it did me while I dictat it, I am sure it will have a good\r\n    effect, which are my earnest prayers to God.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIV.\r\n\r\n\r\nAllusion having been made often, in the course of these memoirs, to the\r\nprocess of \"serving oneself heir\" to an estate, in Scotland: the\r\nfollowing document,[424] shewing the form of such a process, may not be\r\ndeemed uninteresting.\r\n\r\n    Claim for William Maxwell, Esq. of Carruchan, who served heir-male\r\n    in general of Robert, Fourth Earl of Nithisdale.\r\n\r\n    \"Honourable persons and good men of Inquest: I, William Maxwell, of\r\n    Carruchan, who was son of Captain Maxwell of Carruchan, who was son\r\n    of Alexander Maxwell, of Yark and Terraughty, who was son of the\r\n    Honourable James Maxwell, of Breckonside, immediate younger brother\r\n    of John, third Earl of Nithisdale, who was father of Robert, fourth\r\n    Earl of Nithisdale, say unto your wisdoms, that the said Maxwell of\r\n    Nithisdale, nephews of my great-great-great-grandfather, died in the\r\n    faith and peace of our Sovereign Lord the King then reigning, and\r\n    that I am nearest and lawful heir male in general to the said\r\n    Robert, fourth Earl of Nithisdale, the nephew of my\r\n    great-great-great-grandfather, and that I am of lawful age.\r\n    Therefore I beseech your wisdoms to serve and cognesce me nearest\r\n    and lawful heir male in general to the said deceased Robert, fourth\r\n    Earl of Nithisdale, and cause your clerk of the Court to return my\r\n    service to your Majesty's Chancery.
