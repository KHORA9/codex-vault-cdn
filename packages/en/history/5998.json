His “Life of Scott” must always be our first and best\r\nsource, but fragments of information may be gleaned from Sir Walter’s\r\nunpublished correspondence.\r\n\r\nThe Editor owes to the kindness of Mrs. Maxwell Scott permission to\r\nexamine the twenty-four large volumes of letters to Sir Walter, and\r\nsome other manuscripts, which are preserved at Abbotsford. These yield\r\nbut little of contemporary criticism or remark, as is natural, for\r\nScott shared his secret with few, and most topics were more grateful to\r\nhim than his own writings. Lockhart left little for his successors to\r\ndo, and the more any one studies the Abbotsford manuscripts, the more\r\nmust he admire the industry and tact of Scott’s biographer.\r\n\r\nThe Editor has also put together some examples of contemporary\r\npublished criticism which it is now not uninteresting to glance over.\r\nIn selecting these he has been aided by the kindness of Mrs. Ogilbie.\r\nFrom the Abbotsford manuscripts and other sources he has added notes on\r\npoints which have become obscure by lapse of time. He has especially to\r\nthank, for their courteous and ready assistance, Lady Napier and\r\nEttrick, who lent him Sir Walter’s letters to her kinswoman, the\r\nMarchioness of Abercorn; Mr. David Douglas, the editor and publisher of\r\nScott’s “Journal,” who has generously given the help of his antiquarian\r\nknowledge; and Mr. David MacRitchie, who permitted him to use the\r\ncorrected proofs of “Redgauntlet.”\r\n\r\nANDREW LANG\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nADVERTISEMENT TO THE WAVERLEY NOVELS\r\n\r\n\r\nIt has been the occasional occupation of the Author of “Waverley”, for\r\nseveral years past, to revise and correct the voluminous series of\r\nNovels which pass under that name, in order that, if they should ever\r\nappear as his avowed productions, he might render them in some degree\r\ndeserving of a continuance of the public favour with which they have\r\nbeen honoured ever since their first appearance. For a long period,\r\nhowever, it seemed likely that the improved and illustrated edition\r\nwhich he meditated would be a posthumous publication. But the course of\r\nthe events which occasioned the disclosure of the Author’s name having,\r\nin a great measure, restored to him a sort of parental control over\r\nthese Works, he is naturally induced to give them to the press in a\r\ncorrected, and, he hopes, an improved form, while life and health\r\npermit the task of revising and illustrating them. Such being his\r\npurpose, it is necessary to say a few words on the plan of the proposed\r\nEdition.\r\n\r\nIn stating it to be revised and corrected, it is not to be inferred\r\nthat any attempt is made to alter the tenor of the stories, the\r\ncharacter of the actors, or the spirit of the dialogue. There is no\r\ndoubt ample room for emendation in all these points,—but where the tree\r\nfalls it must lie. Any attempt to obviate criticism, however just, by\r\naltering a work already in the hands of the public is generally\r\nunsuccessful. In the most improbable fiction, the reader still desires\r\nsome air of _vraisemblance_, and does not relish that the incidents of\r\na tale familiar to him should be altered to suit the taste of critics,\r\nor the caprice of the Author himself. This process of feeling is so\r\nnatural, that it may be observed even in children, who cannot endure\r\nthat a nursery story should be repeated to them differently from the\r\nmanner in which it was first told.\r\n\r\nBut without altering, in the slightest degree, either the story or the\r\nmode of telling it, the Author has taken this opportunity to correct\r\nerrors of the press and slips of the pen. That such should exist cannot\r\nbe wondered at, when it is considered that the Publishers found it\r\ntheir interest to hurry through the press a succession of the early\r\neditions of the various Novels, and that the Author had not the usual\r\nopportunity of revision. It is hoped that the present edition will be\r\nfound free from errors of that accidental kind.\r\n\r\nThe Author has also ventured to make some emendations of a different\r\ncharacter, which, without being such apparent deviations from the\r\noriginal stories as to disturb the reader’s old associations, will, he\r\nthinks, add something to the spirit of the dialogue, narrative, or\r\ndescription. These consist in occasional pruning where the language is\r\nredundant, compression where the style is loose, infusion of vigour\r\nwhere it is languid, the exchange of less forcible for more appropriate\r\nepithets—slight alterations in short, like the last touches of an\r\nartist, which contribute to heighten and finish the picture, though an\r\ninexperienced eye can hardly detect in what they consist.\r\n\r\nThe General Preface to the new Edition, and the Introductory Notices to\r\neach separate work, will contain an account of such circumstances\r\nattending the first publication of the Novels and Tales as may appear\r\ninteresting in themselves, or proper to be communicated to the public.\r\nThe Author also proposes to publish, on this occasion, the various\r\nlegends, family traditions, or obscure historical facts which have\r\nformed the ground-work of these Novels, and to give some account of the\r\nplaces where the scenes are laid, when these are altogether, or in\r\npart, real; as well as a statement of particular incidents founded on\r\nfact; together with a more copious Glossary, and Notes explanatory of\r\nthe ancient customs and popular superstitions referred to in the\r\nRomances.\r\n\r\nUpon the whole, it is hoped that the Waverley Novels, in their new\r\ndress, will not be found to have lost any part of their attractions in\r\nconsequence of receiving illustrations by the Author, and undergoing\r\nhis careful revision.\r\n\r\nABBOTSFORD, _January_, 1829.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nGENERAL PREFACE TO THE WAVERLEY NOVELS\r\n\r\n\r\nAnd must I ravel out\r\nMy weaved-up follies?\r\n          Richard II, Act IV.\r\n\r\n\r\nHaving undertaken to give an Introductory Account of the compositions\r\nwhich are here offered to the public, with Notes and Illustrations, the\r\nAuthor, under whose name they are now for the first time collected,\r\nfeels that he has the delicate task of speaking more of himself and his\r\npersonal concerns than may perhaps be either graceful or prudent. In\r\nthis particular he runs the risk of presenting himself to the public in\r\nthe relation that the dumb wife in the jest-book held to her husband,\r\nwhen, having spent half of his fortune to obtain the cure of her\r\nimperfection, he was willing to have bestowed the other half to restore\r\nher to her former condition. But this is a risk inseparable from the\r\ntask which the Author has undertaken, and he can only promise to be as\r\nlittle of an egotist as the situation will permit. It is perhaps an\r\nindifferent sign of a disposition to keep his word, that, having\r\nintroduced himself in the third person singular, he proceeds in the\r\nsecond paragraph to make use of the first. But it appears to him that\r\nthe seeming modesty connected with the former mode of writing is\r\noverbalanced by the inconvenience of stiffness and affectation which\r\nattends it during a narrative of some length, and which may be observed\r\nless or more in every work in which the third person is used, from the\r\nCommentaries of Cæsar to the Autobiography of Alexander the\r\nCorrector.(_a_)[*]\r\n\r\n[* See Editor’s Notes at the end of the Volume. Wherever a similar\r\nreference occurs, the reader will understand that the same direction\r\napplies.]\r\n\r\n\r\nI must refer to a very early period of my life, were I to point out my\r\nfirst achievements as a tale-teller; but I believe some of my old\r\nschoolfellows can still bear witness that I had a distinguished\r\ncharacter for that talent, at a time when the applause of my companions\r\nwas my recompense for the disgraces and punishments which the future\r\nromance-writer incurred for being idle himself, and keeping others\r\nidle, during hours that should have been employed on our tasks. The\r\nchief enjoyment of my holidays was to escape with a chosen friend,\r\n(_b_) who had the same taste with myself, and alternately to recite to\r\neach other such wild adventures as we were able to devise. We told,\r\neach in turn, interminable tales of knight-errantry and battles and\r\nenchantments, which were continued from one day to another as\r\nopportunity offered, without our ever thinking of bringing them to a\r\nconclusion. As we observed a strict secrecy on the subject of this\r\nintercourse, it acquired all the character of a concealed pleasure, and\r\nwe used to select for the scenes of our indulgence long walks through\r\nthe solitary and romantic environs of Arthur’s Seat, Salisbury Crags,\r\nBraid Hills, and similar places in the vicinity of Edinburgh; and the\r\nrecollection of those holidays still forms an oasis in the pilgrimage\r\nwhich I have to look back upon. I have only to add, that my friend\r\nstill lives, a prosperous gentleman, but too much occupied with graver\r\nbusiness to thank me for indicating him more plainly as a confidant of\r\nmy childish mystery.\r\n\r\nWhen boyhood advancing into youth required more serious studies and\r\ngraver cares, a long illness threw me back on the kingdom of fiction,\r\nas if it were by a species of fatality. My indisposition arose, in part\r\nat least, from my having broken a blood-vessel; and motion and speech\r\nwere for a long time pronounced positively dangerous. For several weeks\r\nI was confined strictly to my bed, during which time I was not allowed\r\nto speak above a whisper, to eat more than a spoonful or two of boiled\r\nrice, or to have more covering than one thin counterpane. When the\r\nreader is informed that I was at this time a growing youth, with the\r\nspirits, appetite, and impatience of fifteen, and suffered, of course,\r\ngreatly under this severe regimen, which the repeated return of my\r\ndisorder rendered indispensable, he will not be surprised that I was\r\nabandoned to my own discretion, so far as reading (my almost sole\r\namusement) was concerned, and still less so, that I abused the\r\nindulgence which left my time so much at my own disposal.\r\n\r\nThere was at this time a circulating library in Edinburgh, founded, I\r\nbelieve, by the celebrated Allan Ramsay, which, besides containing a\r\nmost respectable collection of books of every description, was, as\r\nmight have been expected, peculiarly rich in works of fiction. It\r\nexhibited specimens of every kind, from the romances of chivalry and\r\nthe ponderous folios of Cyrus and Cassandra, down to the most approved\r\nworks of later times. I was plunged into this great ocean of reading\r\nwithout compass or pilot; and, unless when some one had the charity to\r\nplay at chess with me, I was allowed to do nothing save read from\r\nmorning to night. I was, in kindness and pity, which was perhaps\r\nerroneous, however natural, permitted to select my subjects of study at\r\nmy own pleasure, upon the same principle that the humours of children\r\nare indulged to keep them out of mischief. As my taste and appetite\r\nwere gratified in nothing else, I indemnified myself by becoming a\r\nglutton of books. Accordingly, I believe I read almost all the\r\nromances, old plays, and epic poetry in that formidable collection, and\r\nno doubt was unconsciously amassing materials for the task in which it\r\nhas been my lot to be so much employed.\r\n\r\nAt the same time I did not in all respects abuse the license permitted\r\nme. Familiar acquaintance with the specious miracles of fiction brought\r\nwith it some degree of satiety, and I began by degrees to seek in\r\nhistories, memoirs, voyages and travels, and the like, events nearly as\r\nwonderful as those which were the work of imagination, with the\r\nadditional advantage that they were at least in a great measure true.\r\nThe lapse of nearly two years, during which I was left to the exercise\r\nof my own free will, was followed by a temporary residence in the\r\ncountry, where I was again very lonely but for the amusement which I\r\nderived from a good though old-fashioned library. The vague and wild\r\nuse which I made of this advantage I cannot describe better than by\r\nreferring my reader to the desultory studies of Waverley in a similar\r\nsituation, the passages concerning whose course of reading were\r\nimitated from recollections of my own. It must be understood that the\r\nresemblance extends no farther.\r\n\r\nTime, as it glided on, brought the blessings of confirmed health and\r\npersonal strength, to a degree which had never been expected or hoped\r\nfor. The severe studies necessary to render me fit for my profession\r\noccupied the greater part of my time; and the society of my friends and\r\ncompanions, who were about to enter life along with, me, filled up the\r\ninterval with the usual amusements of young men. I was in a situation\r\nwhich rendered serious labour indispensable; for, neither possessing,\r\non the one hand, any of those peculiar advantages which are supposed to\r\nfavour a hasty advance in the profession of the law, nor being, on the\r\nother hand, exposed to unusual obstacles to interrupt my progress, I\r\nmight reasonably expect to succeed according to the greater or less\r\ndegree of trouble which I should take to qualify myself as a pleader.\r\n\r\nIt makes no part of the present story to detail how the success of a\r\nfew ballads had the effect of changing all the purpose and tenor of my\r\nlife, and of converting a painstaking lawyer of some years’ standing\r\ninto a follower of literature. It is enough to say, that I had assumed\r\nthe latter character for several years before I seriously thought of\r\nattempting a work of imagination in prose, although one or two of my\r\npoetical attempts did not differ from romances otherwise than by being\r\nwritten in verse. But yet I may observe, that about this time (now,\r\nalas! thirty years since) I had nourished the ambitious desire of\r\ncomposing a tale of chivalry, which was to be in the style of the\r\n“Castle of Otranto”, with plenty of Border characters and supernatural\r\nincident. Having found unexpectedly a chapter of this intended work\r\namong some old papers, I have subjoined it to this introductory essay,\r\nthinking some readers may account as curious the first attempts at\r\nromantic composition by an author who has since written so much in that\r\ndepartment.[*] And those who complain, not unreasonably, of the\r\nprofusion of the Tales which have followed Waverley, may bless their\r\nstars at the narrow escape they have made, by the commencement of the\r\ninundation, which had so nearly taken place in the first year of the\r\ncentury, being postponed for fifteen years later.\r\n\r\n[* See the fragment alluded to, in the Appendix No I.]\r\n\r\n\r\nThis particular subject was never resumed, but I did not abandon the\r\nidea of fictitious composition in prose, though I determined to give\r\nanother turn to the style of the work.\r\n\r\nMy early recollections of the Highland scenery and customs made so\r\nfavourable an impression in the poem called the “Lady of the Lake” that\r\nI was induced to think of attempting something of the same kind in\r\nprose. I had been a good deal in the Highlands at a time when they were\r\nmuch less accessible and much less visited than they have been of late\r\nyears, and was acquainted with many of the old warriors of 1745, who\r\nwere, like most veterans, easily induced to fight their battles over\r\nagain for the benefit of a willing listener like myself. It naturally\r\noccurred to me that the ancient traditions and high spirit of a people\r\nwho, living in a civilised age and country, retained so strong a\r\ntincture of manners belonging to an early period of society, must\r\nafford a subject favourable for romance, if it should not prove a\r\ncurious tale marred in the telling.\r\n\r\nIt was with some idea of this kind that, about the year 1805, I threw\r\ntogether about one-third part of the first volume of “Waverley.” It was\r\nadvertised to be published by the late Mr. John Ballantyne, bookseller\r\nin Edinburgh, under the name of “Waverley; or, ’Tis Fifty Years\r\nSince,”—a title afterwards altered to ’Tis Sixty Years Since, that the\r\nactual date of publication might be made to correspond with the period\r\nin which the scene was laid. Having proceeded as far, I think, as the\r\nseventh chapter, I showed my work to a critical friend, whose opinion\r\nwas unfavourable; and having then some poetical reputation, I was\r\nunwilling to risk the loss of it by attempting a new style of\r\ncomposition. I therefore threw aside the work I had commenced, without\r\neither reluctance or remonstrance. I ought to add that, though my\r\ningenious friend’s sentence was afterwards reversed on an appeal to the\r\npublic, it cannot be considered as any imputation on his good taste;\r\nfor the specimen subjected to his criticism did not extend beyond the\r\ndeparture of the hero for Scotland, and consequently had not entered\r\nupon the part of the story which was finally found most interesting.\r\n\r\nBe that as it may, this portion of the manuscript was laid aside in the\r\ndrawers of an old writing-desk, which, on my first coming to reside at\r\nAbbotsford in 1811, was placed in a lumber garret and entirely\r\nforgotten. Thus, though I sometimes, among other literary avocations,\r\nturned my thoughts to the continuation of the romance which I had\r\ncommenced, yet, as I could not find what I had already written, after\r\nsearching such repositories as were within my reach, and was too\r\nindolent to attempt to write it anew from memory, I as often laid aside\r\nall thoughts of that nature.\r\n\r\nTwo circumstances in particular recalled my recollection of the mislaid\r\nmanuscript. The first was the extended and well-merited fame of Miss\r\nEdgeworth, whose Irish characters have gone so far to make the English\r\nfamiliar with the character of their gay and kind-hearted neighbours of\r\nIreland, that she may be truly said to have done more towards\r\ncompleting the Union than perhaps all the legislative enactments by\r\nwhich it has been followed up.\r\n\r\nWithout being so presumptuous as to hope to emulate the rich humour,\r\npathetic tenderness, and admirable tact which pervade the works of my\r\naccomplished friend, I felt that something might be attempted for my\r\nown country, of the same kind with that which Miss Edgeworth so\r\nfortunately achieved for Ireland—something which might introduce her\r\nnatives to those of the sister kingdom in a more favourable light than\r\nthey had been placed hitherto, and tend to procure sympathy for their\r\nvirtues and indulgence for their foibles. I thought also, that much of\r\nwhat I wanted in talent might be made up by the intimate acquaintance\r\nwith the subject which I could lay claim to possess, as having\r\ntravelled through most parts of Scotland, both Highland and Lowland,\r\nhaving been familiar with the elder as well as more modern race, and\r\nhaving had from my infancy free and unrestrained communication with all\r\nranks of my countrymen, from the Scottish peer to the Scottish\r\nplough-man. Such ideas often occurred to me, and constituted an\r\nambitious branch of my theory, however far short I may have fallen of\r\nit in practice.\r\n\r\nBut it was not only the triumphs of Miss Edgeworth which worked in me\r\nemulation, and disturbed my indolence. I chanced actually to engage in\r\na work which formed a sort of essay piece, and gave me hope that I\r\nmight in time become free of the craft of romance-writing, and be\r\nesteemed a tolerable workman.\r\n\r\nIn the year 1807–08 I undertook, at the request of John Murray, Esq.,\r\nof Albemarle Street, to arrange for publication some posthumous\r\nproductions of the late Mr. Joseph Strutt, distinguished as an artist\r\nand an antiquary, amongst which was an unfinished romance, entitled\r\n“Queen-Hoo Hall.” The scene of the tale was laid in the reign of Henry\r\nVI., and the work was written to illustrate the manners, customs, and\r\nlanguage of the people of England during that period. The extensive\r\nacquaintance which Mr. Strutt had acquired with such subjects in\r\ncompiling his laborious “Horda Angel-Cynnan,” his “Royal and\r\nEcclesiastical Antiquities,” and his “Essay on the Sports and Pastimes\r\nof the People of England,” had rendered him familiar with all the\r\nantiquarian lore necessary for the purpose of composing the projected\r\nromance; and although the manuscript bore the marks of hurry and\r\nincoherence natural to the first rough draught of the author, it\r\nevinced (in my opinion) considerable powers of imagination.\r\n\r\nAs the work was unfinished, I deemed it my duty, as editor, to supply\r\nsuch a hasty and inartificial conclusion as could be shaped out from\r\nthe story, of which Mr. Strutt had laid the foundation. This concluding\r\nchapter[*] is also added to the present Introduction, for the reason\r\nalready mentioned regarding the preceding fragment. It was a step in my\r\nadvance towards romantic composition; and to preserve the traces of\r\nthese is in a great measure the object of this Essay.\r\n\r\n[* See Appendix, No. II.]\r\n\r\n\r\n“Queen-Hoo Hall” was not, however, very successful. I thought I was\r\naware of the reason, and supposed that, by rendering his language too\r\nancient, and displaying his antiquarian knowledge too liberally, the\r\ningenious author had raised up an obstacle to his own success. Every\r\nwork designed for mere amusement must be expressed in language easily\r\ncomprehended; and when, as is sometimes the case in “Queen-Hoo Hall,”\r\nthe author addresses himself exclusively to the antiquary, he must be\r\ncontent to be dismissed by the general reader with the criticism of\r\nMungo, in the “Padlock,” on the Mauritanian music, “What signifies me\r\nhear, if me no understand?”\r\n\r\nI conceived it possible to avoid this error; and, by rendering a\r\nsimilar work more light and obvious to general comprehension, to escape\r\nthe rock on which my predecessor was shipwrecked. But I was, on the\r\nother hand, so far discouraged by the indifferent reception of Mr.\r\nStrutt’s romance as to become satisfied that the manners of the middle\r\nages did not possess the interest which I had conceived; and was led to\r\nform the opinion that a romance founded on a Highland story and more\r\nmodern events would have a better chance of popularity than a tale of\r\nchivalry. My thoughts, therefore, returned more than once to the tale\r\nwhich I had actually commenced, and accident at length threw the lost\r\nsheets in my way.\r\n\r\nI happened to want some fishing-tackle for the use of a guest, when it\r\noccurred to me to search the old writing-desk already mentioned, in\r\nwhich I used to keep articles of that nature. I got access to it with\r\nsome difficulty; and, in looking for lines and flies, the long-lost\r\nmanuscript presented itself. I immediately set to work to complete it\r\naccording to my original purpose. And here I must frankly confess that\r\nthe mode in which I conducted the story scarcely deserved the success\r\nwhich the romance afterwards attained.\r\n\r\nThe tale of “Waverley” was put together with so little care that I\r\ncannot boast of having sketched any distinct plan of the work. The\r\nwhole adventures of Waverley, in his movements up and down the country\r\nwith the Highland cateran Bean Lean, are managed without much skill. It\r\nsuited best, however, the road I wanted to travel, and permitted me to\r\nintroduce some descriptions of scenery and manners, to which the\r\nreality gave an interest which the powers of the Author might have\r\notherwise failed to attain for them. And though I have been in other\r\ninstances a sinner in this sort, I do not recollect any of these novels\r\nin which I have transgressed so widely as in the first of the series.\r\n\r\nAmong other unfounded reports, it has been said that the copyright of\r\n“Waverley” was, during the book’s progress through the press, offered\r\nfor sale to various book-sellers in London at a very inconsiderable\r\nprice. This was not the case. Messrs. Constable and Cadell, who\r\npublished the work, were the only persons acquainted with the contents\r\nof the publication, and they offered a large sum for it while in the\r\ncourse of printing, which, however, was declined, the Author not\r\nchoosing to part with the copyright.\r\n\r\nThe origin of the story of “Waverley,” and the particular facts on\r\nwhich it is founded, are given in the separate introduction prefixed to\r\nthat romance in this edition, and require no notice in this place.\r\n\r\n“Waverley” was published in 1814, and, as the title-page was without\r\nthe name of the Author, the work was left to win its way in the world\r\nwithout any of the usual recommendations. Its progress was for some\r\ntime slow; but after the first two or three months its popularity had\r\nincreased in a degree which must have satisfied the expectations of the\r\nAuthor, had these been far more sanguine than he ever entertained.\r\n\r\nGreat anxiety was expressed to learn the name of the Author, but on\r\nthis no authentic information could be attained. My original motive for\r\npublishing the work anonymously was the consciousness that it was an\r\nexperiment on the public taste which might very probably fail, and\r\ntherefore there was no occasion to take on myself the personal risk of\r\ndiscomfiture. For this purpose considerable precautions were used to\r\npreserve secrecy. My old friend and schoolfellow, Mr. James Ballantyne,\r\nwho printed these Novels, had the exclusive task of corresponding with\r\nthe Author, who thus had not only the advantage of his professional\r\ntalents, but also of his critical abilities. The original manuscript,\r\nor, as it is technically called, copy, was transcribed under Mr.\r\nBallantyne’s eye by confidential persons; nor was there an instance of\r\ntreachery during the many years in which these precautions were\r\nresorted to, although various individuals were employed at different\r\ntimes. Double proof-sheets were regularly printed off. One was\r\nforwarded to the Author by Mr. Ballantyne, and the alterations which it\r\nreceived were, by his own hand, copied upon the other proof-sheet for\r\nthe use of the printers, so that even the corrected proofs of the\r\nAuthor were never seen in the printing office; and thus the curiosity\r\nof such eager inquirers as made the most minute investigation was\r\nentirely at fault.\r\n\r\nBut although the cause of concealing the Author’s name in the first\r\ninstance, when the reception of “Waverley” was doubtful, was natural\r\nenough, it is more difficult, it may be thought, to account for the\r\nsame desire for secrecy during the subsequent editions, to the amount\r\nof betwixt eleven and twelve thousand copies, which followed each other\r\nclose, and proved the success of the work. I am sorry I can give little\r\nsatisfaction to queries on this subject. I have already stated\r\nelsewhere that I can render little better reason for choosing to remain\r\nanonymous than by saying with Shylock, that such was my humour. It will\r\nbe observed that I had not the usual stimulus for desiring personal\r\nreputation, the desire, namely, to float amidst the conversation of\r\nmen. Of literary fame, whether merited or undeserved, I had already as\r\nmuch as might have contented a mind more ambitious than mine; and in\r\nentering into this new contest for reputation I might be said rather to\r\nendanger what I had than to have any considerable chance of acquiring\r\nmore. I was affected, too, by none of those motives which, at an\r\nearlier period of life, would doubtless have operated upon me. My\r\nfriendships were formed, my place in society fixed, my life had\r\nattained its middle course. My condition in society was higher perhaps\r\nthan I deserved, certainly as high as I wished, and there was scarce\r\nany degree of literary success which could have greatly altered or\r\nimproved my personal condition.\r\n\r\nI was not, therefore, touched by the spur of ambition, usually\r\nstimulating on such occasions; and yet I ought to stand exculpated from\r\nthe charge of ungracious or unbecoming indifference to public applause.\r\nI did not the less feel gratitude for the public favour, although I did\r\nnot proclaim it; as the lover who wears his mistress’s favour in his\r\nbosom is as proud, though not so vain, of possessing it as another who\r\ndisplays the token of her grace upon his bonnet. Far from such an\r\nungracious state of mind, I have seldom felt more satisfaction than\r\nwhen, returning from a pleasure voyage, I found “Waverley” in the\r\nzenith of popularity, and public curiosity in full cry after the name\r\nof the Author. The knowledge that I had the public approbation was like\r\nhaving the property of a hidden treasure, not less gratifying to the\r\nowner than if all the world knew that it was his own. Another advantage\r\nwas connected with the secrecy which I observed. I could appear or\r\nretreat from the stage at pleasure, without attracting any personal\r\nnotice or attention, other than what might be founded on suspicion\r\nonly. In my own person also, as a successful author in another\r\ndepartment of literature, I might have been charged with too frequent\r\nintrusions on the public patience; but the Author of “Waverley” was in\r\nthis respect as impassible to the critic as the Ghost of Hamlet to the\r\npartisan of Marcellus. Perhaps the curiosity of the public, irritated\r\nby the existence of a secret, and kept afloat by the discussions which\r\ntook place on the subject from time to time, went a good way to\r\nmaintain an unabated interest in these frequent publications. There was\r\na mystery concerning the Author which each new novel was expected to\r\nassist in unravelling, although it might in other respects rank lower\r\nthan its predecessors.\r\n\r\nI may perhaps be thought guilty of affectation, should I allege as one\r\nreason of my silence a secret dislike to enter on personal discussions\r\nconcerning my own literary labours. It is in every case a dangerous\r\nintercourse for an author to be dwelling continually among those who\r\nmake his writings a frequent and familiar subject of conversation, but\r\nwho must necessarily be partial judges of works composed in their own\r\nsociety. The habits of self-importance which are thus acquired by\r\nauthors are highly injurious to a well-regulated mind; for the cup of\r\nflattery, if it does not, like that of Circe, reduce men to the level\r\nof beasts, is sure, if eagerly drained, to bring the best and the\r\nablest down to that of fools. This risk was in some degree prevented by\r\nthe mask which I wore; and my own stores of self-conceit were left to\r\ntheir natural course, without being enhanced by the partiality of\r\nfriends or adulation of flatterers.\r\n\r\nIf I am asked further reasons for the conduct I have long observed, I\r\ncan only resort to the explanation supplied by a critic as friendly as\r\nhe is intelligent; namely, that the mental organisation of the novelist\r\nmust be characterised, to speak craniologically, by an extraordinary\r\ndevelopment of the passion for delitescency! I the rather suspect some\r\nnatural disposition of this kind; for, from the instant I perceived the\r\nextreme curiosity manifested on the subject, I felt a secret\r\nsatisfaction in baffling it, for which, when its unimportance is\r\nconsidered, I do not well know how to account.\r\n\r\nMy desire to remain concealed, in the character of the Author of these\r\nNovels, subjected me occasionally to awkward embarrassments, as it\r\nsometimes happened that those who were sufficiently intimate with me\r\nwould put the question in direct terms. In this case, only one of three\r\ncourses could be followed. Either I must have surrendered my secret, or\r\nhave returned an equivocating answer, or, finally, must have stoutly\r\nand boldly denied the fact. The first was a sacrifice which I conceive\r\nno one had a right to force from me, since I alone was concerned in the\r\nmatter. The alternative of rendering a doubtful answer must have left\r\nme open to the degrading suspicion that I was not unwilling to assume\r\nthe merit (if there was any) which I dared not absolutely lay claim to;\r\nor those who might think more justly of me must have received such an\r\nequivocal answer as an indirect avowal. I therefore considered myself\r\nentitled, like an accused person put upon trial, to refuse giving my\r\nown evidence to my own conviction, and flatly to deny all that could\r\nnot be proved against me. At the same time I usually qualified my\r\ndenial by stating that, had I been the Author of these works, I would\r\nhave felt myself quite entitled to protect my secret by refusing my own\r\nevidence, when it was asked for to accomplish a discovery of what I\r\ndesired to conceal.\r\n\r\nThe real truth is, that I never expected or hoped to disguise my\r\nconnection with these Novels from any one who lived on terms of\r\nintimacy with me. The number of coincidences which necessarily existed\r\nbetween narratives recounted, modes of expression, and opinions\r\nbroached in these Tales and such as were used by their Author in the\r\nintercourse of private life must have been far too great to permit any\r\nof my familiar acquaintances to doubt the identity betwixt their friend\r\nand the Author of “Waverley;” and I believe they were all morally\r\nconvinced of it. But while I was myself silent, their belief could not\r\nweigh much more with the world than that of others; their opinions and\r\nreasoning were liable to be taxed with partiality, or confronted with\r\nopposing arguments and opinions; and the question was not so much\r\nwhether I should be generally acknowledged to be the Author, in spite\r\nof my own denial, as whether even my own avowal of the works, if such\r\nshould be made, would be sufficient to put me in undisputed possession\r\nof that character.\r\n\r\nI have been often asked concerning supposed cases, in which I was said\r\nto have been placed on the verge of discovery; but, as I maintained my\r\npoint with the composure of a lawyer of thirty years’ standing, I never\r\nrecollect being in pain or confusion on the subject. In Captain\r\nMedwyn’s “Conversations of Lord Byron” the reporter states himself to\r\nhave asked my noble and highly gifted friend, “If he was certain about\r\nthese Novels being Sir Walter Scott’s?” To which Lord Byron replied,\r\n“Scott as much as owned himself the Author of ‘Waverley’ to me in\r\nMurray’s shop. I was talking to him about that Novel, and lamented that\r\nits Author had not carried back the story nearer to the time of the\r\nRevolution. Scott, entirely off his guard, replied, ‘Ay, I might have\r\ndone so; but—’ there he stopped. It was in vain to attempt to correct\r\nhimself; he looked confused, and relieved his embarrassment by a\r\nprecipitate retreat.” I have no recollection whatever of this scene\r\ntaking place, and I should have thought that I was more likely to have\r\nlaughed than to appear confused, for I certainly never hoped to impose\r\nupon Lord Byron in a case of the kind; and from the manner in which he\r\nuniformly expressed himself, I knew his opinion was entirely formed,\r\nand that any disclamations of mine would only have savoured of\r\naffectation. I do not mean to insinuate that the incident did not\r\nhappen, but only that it could hardly have occurred exactly under the\r\ncircumstances narrated, without my recollecting something positive on\r\nthe subject. In another part of the same volume Lord Byron is reported\r\nto have expressed a supposition that the cause of my not avowing myself\r\nthe Author of “Waverley” may have been some surmise that the reigning\r\nfamily would have been displeased with the work. I can only say, it is\r\nthe last apprehension I should have entertained, as indeed the\r\ninscription to these volumes sufficiently proves. The sufferers of that\r\nmelancholy period have, during the last and present reign, been\r\nhonoured both with the sympathy and protection of the reigning family,\r\nwhose magnanimity can well pardon a sigh from others, and bestow one\r\nthemselves, to the memory of brave opponents, who did nothing in hate,\r\nbut all in honour.\r\n\r\nWhile those who were in habitual intercourse with the real author had\r\nlittle hesitation in assigning the literary property to him, others,\r\nand those critics of no mean rank, employed themselves in investigating\r\nwith persevering patience any characteristic features which might seem\r\nto betray the origin of these Novels. Amongst these, one gentleman,\r\nequally remarkable for the kind and liberal tone of his criticism, the\r\nacuteness of his reasoning, and the very gentlemanlike manner in which\r\nhe conducted his inquiries, displayed not only powers of accurate\r\ninvestigation, but a temper of mind deserving to be employed on a\r\nsubject of much greater importance; and I have no doubt made converts\r\nto his opinion of almost all who thought the point worthy of\r\nconsideration.[*] Of those letters, and other attempts of the same\r\nkind, the Author could not complain, though his incognito was\r\nendangered. He had challenged the public to a game at bo-peep, and if\r\nhe was discovered in his “hiding-hole,” he must submit to the shame of\r\ndetection.\r\n\r\n[* Letters on the Author of Waverley; Rodwell and Martin, London,\r\n1822.(_d_)]\r\n\r\n\r\nVarious reports were of course circulated in various ways; some founded\r\non an inaccurate rehearsal of what may have been partly real, some on\r\ncircumstances having no concern whatever with the subject, and others\r\non the invention of some importunate persons, who might perhaps imagine\r\nthat the readiest mode of forcing the Author to disclose himself was to\r\nassign some dishonourable and discreditable cause for his silence.\r\n\r\nIt may be easily supposed that this sort of inquisition was treated\r\nwith contempt by the person whom it principally regarded; as, among all\r\nthe rumours that were current, there was only one, and that as\r\nunfounded as the others, which had nevertheless some alliance to\r\nprobability, and indeed might have proved in some degree true.\r\n\r\nI allude to a report which ascribed a great part, or the whole, of\r\nthese Novels to the late Thomas Scott, Esq., of the 70th Regiment, then\r\nstationed in Canada. Those who remember that gentleman will readily\r\ngrant that, with general talents at least equal to those of his elder\r\nbrother, he added a power of social humour and a deep insight into\r\nhuman character which rendered him an universally delightful member of\r\nsociety, and that the habit of composition alone was wanting to render\r\nhim equally successful as a writer. The Author of “Waverley” was so\r\npersuaded of the truth of this, that he warmly pressed his brother to\r\nmake such an experiment, and willingly undertook all the trouble of\r\ncorrecting and superintending the press. Mr. Thomas Scott seemed at\r\nfirst very well disposed to embrace the proposal, and had even fixed on\r\na subject and a hero. The latter was a person well known to both of us\r\nin our boyish years, from having displayed some strong traits of\r\ncharacter. Mr. T. Scott had determined to represent his youthful\r\nacquaintance as emigrating to America, and encountering the dangers and\r\nhardships of the New World, with the same dauntless spirit which he had\r\ndisplayed when a boy in his native country. Mr. Scott would probably\r\nhave been highly successful, being familiarly acquainted with the\r\nmanners of the native Indians, of the old French settlers in Canada,\r\nand of the Brulés, or Woodsmen, and having the power of observing with\r\naccuracy what I have no doubt he could have sketched with force and\r\nexpression. In short, the Author believes his brother would have made\r\nhimself distinguished in that striking field in which, since that\r\nperiod, Mr. Cooper has achieved so many triumphs. But Mr. T. Scott was\r\nalready affected by bad health, which wholly unfitted him for literary\r\nlabour, even if he could have reconciled his patience to the task. He\r\nnever, I believe, wrote a single line of the projected work; and I only\r\nhave the melancholy pleasure of preserving in the Appendix[*] the\r\nsimple anecdote on which he proposed to found it.\r\n\r\n[* See Appendix, No. III.]\r\n\r\n\r\nTo this I may add, I can easily conceive that there may have been\r\ncircumstances which gave a colour to the general report of my brother\r\nbeing interested in these works; and in particular that it might derive\r\nstrength from my having occasion to remit to him, in consequence of\r\ncertain family transactions, some considerable sums of money about that\r\nperiod. To which it is to be added that if any person chanced to evince\r\nparticular curiosity on such a subject, my brother was likely enough to\r\ndivert himself with practising on their credulity.\r\n\r\nIt may be mentioned that, while the paternity of these Novels was from\r\ntime to time warmly disputed in Britain, the foreign booksellers\r\nexpressed no hesitation on the matter, but affixed my name to the whole\r\nof the Novels, and to some besides to which I had no claim.\r\n\r\nThe volumes, therefore, to which the present pages form a Preface are\r\nentirely the composition of the Author by whom they are now\r\nacknowledged, with the exception, always, of avowed quotations, and\r\nsuch unpremeditated and involuntary plagiarisms as can scarce be\r\nguarded against by any one who has read and written a great deal. The\r\noriginal manuscripts are all in existence, and entirely written\r\n(_horresco referens_) in the Author’s own hand, excepting during the\r\nyears 1818 and 1819, when, being affected with severe illness, he was\r\nobliged to employ the assistance of a friendly amanuensis.\r\n\r\nThe number of persons to whom the secret was necessarily entrusted, or\r\ncommunicated by chance, amounted, I should think, to twenty at least,\r\nto whom I am greatly obliged for the fidelity with which they observed\r\ntheir trust, until the derangement of the affairs of my publishers,\r\nMessrs. Constable and Co., and the exposure of their account books,\r\nwhich was the necessary consequence, rendered secrecy no longer\r\npossible. The particulars attending the avowal have been laid before\r\nthe public in the Introduction to the “Chronicles of the Canongate.”\r\n\r\nThe preliminary advertisement has given a sketch of the purpose of this\r\nedition. I have some reason to fear that the notes which accompany the\r\ntales, as now published, may be thought too miscellaneous and too\r\negotistical. It maybe some apology for this, that the publication was\r\nintended to be posthumous, and still more, that old men may be\r\npermitted to speak long, because they cannot in the course of nature\r\nhave long time to speak. In preparing the present edition, I have done\r\nall that I can do to explain the nature of my materials, and the use I\r\nhave made of them; nor is it probable that I shall again revise or even\r\nread these tales. I was therefore desirous rather to exceed in the\r\nportion of new and explanatory matter which is added to this edition\r\nthan that the reader should have reason to complain that the\r\ninformation communicated was of a general and merely nominal character.\r\nIt remains to be tried whether the public (like a child to whom a watch\r\nis shown) will, after having been satiated with looking at the outside,\r\nacquire some new interest in the object when it is opened and the\r\ninternal machinery displayed to them.\r\n\r\nThat “Waverley” and its successors have had their day of favour and\r\npopularity must be admitted with sincere gratitude; and the Author has\r\nstudied (with the prudence of a beauty whose reign has been rather\r\nlong) to supply, by the assistance of art, the charms which novelty no\r\nlonger affords. The publishers have endeavoured to gratify the\r\nhonourable partiality of the public for the encouragement of British\r\nart, by illustrating this edition with designs by the most eminent\r\nliving artists.\r\n\r\n[Footnote: The illustrations here referred to were made for the edition\r\nof 1829]\r\n\r\n\r\nTo my distinguished countryman, David Wilkie, to Edwin Landseer, who\r\nhas exercised his talents so much on Scottish subjects and scenery, to\r\nMessrs. Leslie and Newton, my thanks are due, from a friend as well as\r\nan author. Nor am I less obliged to Messrs. Cooper, Kidd, and other\r\nartists of distinction to whom I am less personally known, for the\r\nready zeal with which they have devoted their talents to the same\r\npurpose.\r\n\r\nFarther explanation respecting the Edition is the business of the\r\npublishers, not of the Author; and here, therefore, the latter has\r\naccomplished his task of introduction and explanation. If, like a\r\nspoiled child, he has sometimes abused or trifled with the indulgence\r\nof the public, he feels himself entitled to full belief when he\r\nexculpates himself from the charge of having been at any time\r\ninsensible of their kindness.\r\n\r\nABBOTSFORD,\r\n1_st January_, 1829.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAPPENDIX\r\nNo. I.[*]\r\n\r\nFRAGMENT OF A ROMANCE WHICH WAS TO HAVE BEEN ENTITLED\r\n\r\nTHOMAS THE RHYMER.\r\n\r\n[* It is not to be supposed that these fragments are given as\r\npossessing any intrinsic value of themselves; but there may be some\r\ncuriosity attached to them, as to the first etchings of a plate, which\r\nare accounted interesting by those who have, in any degree, been\r\ninterested in the more finished works of the artist.]\r\n\r\nCHAPTER I.\r\n\r\nThe sun was nearly set behind the distant mountains of Liddesdale, when\r\na few of the scattered and terrified inhabitants of the village of\r\nHersildoun, which had four days before been burned by a predatory band\r\nof English Borderers, were now busied in repairing their ruined\r\ndwellings. One high tower in the centre of the village alone exhibited\r\nno appearance of devastation. It was surrounded with court walls, and\r\nthe outer gate was barred and bolted. The bushes and brambles which\r\ngrew around, and had even insinuated their branches beneath the gate,\r\nplainly showed that it must have been many years since it had been\r\nopened. While the cottages around lay in smoking ruins, this pile,\r\ndeserted and desolate as it seemed to be, had suffered nothing from the\r\nviolence of the invaders; and the wretched beings who were endeavouring\r\nto repair their miserable huts against nightfall, seemed to neglect the\r\npreferable shelter which it might have afforded them, without the\r\nnecessity of labour.\r\n\r\nBefore the day had quite gone down, a knight, richly armed, and mounted\r\nupon an ambling hackney, rode slowly into the village. His attendants\r\nwere a lady, apparently young and beautiful, who rode by his side upon\r\na dappled palfrey; his squire, who carried his helmet and lance, and\r\nled his battle-horse, a noble steed, richly caparisoned. A page and\r\nfour yeomen, bearing bows and quivers, short swords, and targets of a\r\nspan breadth, completed his equipage, which, though small, denoted him\r\nto be a man of high rank.\r\n\r\nHe stopped and addressed several of the inhabitants whom curiosity had\r\nwithdrawn from their labour to gaze at him; but at the sound of his\r\nvoice, and still more on perceiving the St. George’s Cross in the caps\r\nof his followers, they fled, with a loud cry that the Southrons were\r\nreturned. The knight endeavoured to expostulate with the fugitives, who\r\nwere chiefly aged men, women, and children; but their dread of the\r\nEnglish name accelerated their flight, and in a few minutes, excepting\r\nthe knight and his attendants, the place was deserted by all. He paced\r\nthrough the village to seek a shelter for the night, and despairing to\r\nfind one either in the inaccessible tower or the plundered huts of the\r\npeasantry, he directed his course to the left hand, where he spied a\r\nsmall, decent habitation, apparently the abode of a man considerably\r\nabove the common rank. After much knocking, the proprietor at length\r\nshowed himself at the window, and speaking in the English dialect, with\r\ngreat signs of apprehension, demanded their business. The warrior\r\nreplied that his quality was an English knight and baron, and that he\r\nwas travelling to the court of the king of Scotland on affairs of\r\nconsequence to both kingdoms.\r\n\r\n“Pardon my hesitation, noble Sir Knight,” said the old man, as he\r\nunbolted and unbarred his doors,—\r\n\r\n“Pardon my hesitation, but we are here exposed to too many intrusions\r\nto admit of our exercising unlimited and unsuspicious hospitality. What\r\nI have is yours; and God send your mission may bring back peace and the\r\ngood days of our old Queen Margaret!”\r\n\r\n“Amen, worthy franklin,” quoth the knight,—“Did you know her?”\r\n\r\n“I came to this country in her train,” said the franklin; “and the care\r\nof some of her jointure lands, which she devolved on me, occasioned my\r\nsettling here.”\r\n\r\n“And how do you, being an Englishman,” said the knight, “protect your\r\nlife and property here, when one of your nation cannot obtain a single\r\nnight’s lodging, or a draught of water, were he thirsty?”\r\n\r\n“Marry, noble sir,” answered the franklin, “use, as they say, will make\r\na man live in a lion’s den; and as I settled here in a quiet time, and\r\nhave never given cause of offence, I am respected by my neighbours, and\r\neven, as you see, by our _forayers_ from England.”\r\n\r\n“I rejoice to hear it, and accept your hospitality. Isabella, my love,\r\nour worthy host will provide you a bed. My daughter, good franklin, is\r\nill at ease. We will occupy your house till the Scottish king shall\r\nreturn from his Northern expedition. Meanwhile call me Lord Lacy of\r\nChester.”\r\n\r\nThe attendants of the baron, assisted by the franklin, were now busied\r\nin disposing of the horses and arranging the table for some refreshment\r\nfor Lord Lacy and his fair companion. While they sat down to it, they\r\nwere attended by their host and his daughter, whom custom did not\r\npermit to eat in their presence, and who afterwards withdrew to an\r\nouter chamber, where the squire and page (both young men of noble\r\nbirth) partook of supper, and were accommodated with beds. The yeomen,\r\nafter doing honour to the rustic cheer of Queen Margaret’s bailiff,\r\nwithdrew to the stable, and each, beside his favourite horse, snored\r\naway the fatigues of their journey. Early on the following morning the\r\ntravellers were roused by a thundering knocking at the door of the\r\nhouse, accompanied with many demands for instant admission, in the\r\nroughest tone. The squire and page, of Lord Lacy, after buckling on\r\ntheir arms, were about to sally out to chastise these intruders, when\r\nthe old host, after looking out at a private casement, contrived for\r\nreconnoitring his visitors, entreated them, with great signs of terror,\r\nto be quiet, if they did not mean that all in the house should be\r\nmurdered.\r\n\r\nHe then hastened to the apartment of Lord Lacy, whom he met dressed in\r\na long furred gown and the knightly cap called a _mortier_, irritated\r\nat the noise, and demanding to know the cause which had disturbed the\r\nrepose of the household.\r\n\r\n“Noble sir,” said the franklin, “one of the most formidable and bloody\r\nof the Scottish Border riders is at hand. He is never seen,” added he,\r\nfaltering with terror, “so far from the hills, but with some bad\r\npurpose, and the power of accomplishing it; so hold yourself to your\r\nguard, for—”\r\n\r\nA loud crash here announced that the door was broken down, and the\r\nknight just descended the stair in time to prevent bloodshed betwixt\r\nhis attendants and the intruders. They were three in number. Their\r\nchief was tall, bony, and athletic, his spare and muscular frame, as\r\nwell as the hardness of his features, marked the course of his life to\r\nhave been fatiguing and perilous. The effect of his appearance was\r\naggravated by his dress, which consisted of a jack, or jacket, composed\r\nof thick buff leather, on which small plates of iron of a lozenge form\r\nwere stitched, in such a manner as to overlap each other and form a\r\ncoat of mail, which swayed with every motion of the wearer’s body. This\r\ndefensive armour covered a doublet of coarse gray cloth, and the\r\nBorderer had a few half-rusted plates of steel on his shoulders, a\r\ntwo-edged sword, with a dagger hanging beside it, in a buff belt; a\r\nhelmet, with a few iron bars, to cover the face instead of a visor, and\r\na lance of tremendous and uncommon length, completed his appointments.\r\nThe looks of the man were as wild and rude as his attire; his keen\r\nblack eyes never rested one moment fixed upon a single object, but\r\nconstantly traversed all around, as if they ever sought some danger to\r\noppose, some plunder to seize, or some insult to revenge. The latter\r\nseemed to be his present object, for, regardless of the dignified\r\npresence of Lord Lacy, he uttered the most incoherent threats against\r\nthe owner of the house and his guests.\r\n\r\n“We shall see—ay, marry shall we—if an English hound is to harbour and\r\nreset the Southrons here. Thank the Abbot of Melrose and the good\r\nKnight of Coldingnow that have so long kept me from your skirts. But\r\nthose days are gone, by St. Mary, and you shall find it!”\r\n\r\nIt is probable the enraged Borderer would not have long continued to\r\nvent his rage in empty menaces, had not the entrance of the four\r\nyeomen, with their bows bent, convinced him that the force was not at\r\nthis moment on his own side.\r\n\r\nLord Lacy now advanced towards him. “You intrude upon my privacy,\r\nsoldier; withdraw yourself and Your followers. There is peace betwixt\r\nour nations, or my servants should chastise thy presumption.”\r\n\r\n“Such peace as ye give such shall you have,” answered the moss-trooper,\r\nfirst pointing with his lance towards the burned village, and then\r\nalmost instantly levelling it against Lord Lacy. The squire drew his\r\nsword, and severed at one blow the steel head from the truncheon of the\r\nspear.\r\n\r\n“Arthur Fitzherbert,” said the baron, “that stroke has deferred thy\r\nknighthood for one year; never must that squire wear the spurs whose\r\nunbridled impetuosity can draw unbidden his sword in the presence of\r\nhis master. Go hence, and think on what I have said.”\r\n\r\nThe squire left the chamber abashed.\r\n\r\n“It were vain,” continued Lord Lacy, “to expect that courtesy from a\r\nmountain churl which even my own followers can forget. Yet before thou\r\ndrawest thy brand,” for the intruder laid his hand upon the hilt of his\r\nsword, “thou wilt do well to reflect that I came with a safe-conduct\r\nfrom thy king, and have no time to waste in brawls with such as thou.”\r\n\r\n“From _my_ king,—from my king!” re-echoed the mountaineer. “I care not\r\nthat rotten truncheon,” striking the shattered spear furiously on the\r\nground, “for the king of Fife and Lothian. But Habby of Cessford will\r\nbe here belive; and we shall soon know if he will permit an English\r\nchurl to occupy his hostelry.”\r\n\r\nHaving uttered these words, accompanied with a lowering glance from\r\nunder his shaggy black eyebrows, he turned on his heel and left the\r\nhouse with his two followers; they mounted their horses, which they had\r\ntied to an outer fence, and vanished in an instant.\r\n\r\n“Who is this discourteous ruffian?” said Lord Lacy to the franklin, who\r\nhad stood in the most violent agitation during this whole scene.\r\n\r\n“His name, noble lord, is Adam Kerr of the Moat, but he is commonly\r\ncalled by his companions the Black Rider of Cheviot. I fear, I fear, he\r\ncomes hither for no good; but if the Lord of Cessford be near, he will\r\nnot dare offer any unprovoked outrage.”\r\n\r\n“I have heard of that chief,” said the baron; “let me know when he\r\napproaches. And do thou, Rodulph,” to the eldest yeoman, “keep a strict\r\nwatch. Adelbert,” to the page, “attend to arm me.” The page bowed, and\r\nthe baron withdrew to the chamber of the lady Isabella, to explain the\r\ncause of the disturbance.\r\n\r\n\r\nNo more of the proposed tale was ever written; but the Author’s purpose\r\nwas that it should turn upon a fine legend of superstition which is\r\ncurrent in the part of the Borders where he had his residence, where,\r\nin the reign of Alexander III. of Scotland, that renowned person,\r\nThomas of Hersildoune, called the Rhymer, actually flourished. This\r\npersonage, the Merlin of Scotland, and to whom some of the adventures\r\nwhich the British bards assigned to Merlin Caledonius, or the Wild,\r\nhave been transferred by tradition, was, as is well known, a magician,\r\nas well as a poet and prophet. He is alleged still to live in the land\r\nof Faery, and is expected to return at some great convulsion of\r\nsociety, in which he is to act a distinguished part,—a tradition common\r\nto all nations, as the belief of the Mahomedans respecting their\r\ntwelfth Imaum demonstrates.\r\n\r\nNow, it chanced many years since that there lived on the Borders a\r\njolly, rattling horse-cowper, who was remarkable for a reckless and\r\nfearless temper, which made him much admired, and a little dreaded,\r\namongst his neighbours. One moonlight night, as he rode over Bowden\r\nMoor, on the west side of the Eildon Hills, the scene of Thomas the\r\nRhymer’s prophecies, and often mentioned in his story, having a brace\r\nof horses along with him which he had not been able to dispose of, he\r\nmet a man of venerable appearance and singularly antique dress, who, to\r\nhis great surprise, asked the price of his horses, and began to chaffer\r\nwith him on the subject. To Canobie Dick—(for so shall we call our\r\nBorder dealer)—a chap was a chap, and he would have sold a liaise to\r\nthe devil himself, without minding his cloven hoof, and would have\r\nprobably cheated Old Nick into the bargain. The stranger paid the price\r\nthey agreed on; and all that puzzled Dick in the transaction was that\r\nthe gild which he received was in unicorns, bonnet-pieces, and other\r\nancient coins, which would have been invaluable to collectors, but were\r\nrather troublesome, in modern currency.\r\n\r\nIt was gold, however, and therefore Dick contrived to get better value\r\nfor the coin than he perhaps gave to his customer. By the command of so\r\ngood a merchant, he brought horses to the same slot more than once; the\r\npurchaser only stipulating that he should always come by night, and\r\nalone. I do not know whether it was from mere curiosity, or whether\r\nsome hope of gain mixed with it, but after Dick had sold several horses\r\nin this way, he began to complain that dry-bargains were unlucky, and\r\nto hint that since his chap must live in the neighbourhood, he ought,\r\nin the courtesy of dealing, to treat him to half a mutchkin.\r\n\r\n“You may see my dwelling if you will,” said the stranger; “but if you\r\nlose courage at what you see there, you will rue it all your life.”\r\n\r\nDicken, however, laughed the warning to scorn, and having alighted to\r\nsecure his horse, he followed the stranger up a narrow foot-path, which\r\nled them up the hills to the singular eminence stuck betwixt the most\r\nsouthern and the centre peaks, and called, from its resemblance to such\r\nan animal in its form, the Lucken Hare. At the foot of this eminence,\r\nwhich is almost as famous for witch meetings as the neighbouring\r\nwind-mill of Kippilaw, Dick was somewhat startled to observe that his\r\nconductor entered the hill-side by a passage or cavern, of which he\r\nhimself, though well acquainted with the spot, had never seen or heard.\r\n\r\n“You may still return,” said his guide, looking ominously back upon\r\nhim; but Dick scorned to show the white feather, and on they went. They\r\nentered a very long range of stables; in every stall stood a coal-black\r\nhorse; by every horse lay a knight in coal-black armour, with a drawn\r\nsword in his hand; but all were as silent, hoof and limb, as if they\r\nhad been cut out of marble. A great number of torches lent a gloomy\r\nlustre to the hall, which, like those of the Caliph Vathek, was of\r\nlarge dimensions. At the upper end, however, they at length arrived,\r\nwhere a sword and horn lay on an antique table.\r\n\r\n“He that shall sound that horn and draw that sword,” said the stranger,\r\nwho now intimated that he was the famous Thomas of Hersildoune, “shall,\r\nif his heart fail him not, be king over all broad Britain. So speaks\r\nthe tongue that cannot lie. But all depends on courage, and much on\r\nyour taking the sword or the horn first.” Dick was much disposed to\r\ntake the sword; but his bold spirit was quailed by the supernatural\r\nterrors of the hall, and he thought to unsheathe the sword first, might\r\nbe construed into defiance, and give offence to the powers of the\r\nMountain. He took the bugle with a trembling hand, and a feeble note,\r\nbut loud enough to produce a terrible answer. Thunder rolled in\r\nstunning peals through the immense hall; horses and men started to\r\nlife; the steeds snorted, stamped, grinned their bits, and tossed on\r\nhigh their heads; the warriors sprung to their feet, clashed their\r\narmour, and brandished their swords. Dick’s terror was extreme at\r\nseeing the whole army, which had been so lately silent as the grave, in\r\nuproar, and about to rush on him. He dropped the horn, and made a\r\nfeeble attempt to seize the enchanted sword; but at the same moment a\r\nvoice pronounced aloud the mysterious words,—\r\n\r\n“Woe to the coward, that ever he was born,\r\nWho did not draw the sword before he blew the horn!”\r\n\r\n\r\nAt the same time a whirlwind of irresistible fury howled through the\r\nlong hall, bore the unfortunate horse-jockey clear out of the mouth of\r\nthe cavern, and precipitated him over a steep bank of loose stones,\r\nwhere the shepherds found him the next morning with just breath\r\nsufficient to tell his fearful tale, after concluding which he expired.\r\n\r\nThis legend, with several variations, is found in many parts of\r\nScotland and England. The scene is sometimes laid in some favourite\r\nglen of the Highlands, sometimes in the deep coal-mines of\r\nNorthumberland and Cumberland, which rim so far beneath the ocean. It\r\nis also to be found in Reginald Scott’s book on Witchcraft, which was\r\nwritten in the sixteenth century. It would be in vain to ask what was\r\nthe original of the tradition. The choice between the horn and sword\r\nmay, perhaps, include as a moral that it is foolhardy to awaken danger\r\nbefore we have arms in our hands to resist it.\r\n\r\nAlthough admitting of much poetical ornament, it is clear that this\r\nlegend would have formed but an unhappy foundation for a prose story,\r\nand must have degenerated into a mere fairy tale. Dr. John Leyden has\r\nbeautifully introduced the tradition in his “Scenes of Infancy”:—\r\n\r\n“Mysterious Rhymer, doomed by fate’s decree\r\nStill to revisit Eildon’s fated tree,\r\nWhere oft the swain, at dawn of Hallow-day,\r\nHears thy fleet barb with wild impatience neigh,—\r\nSay, who is he, with summons long and high,\r\nShall bid the charmed sleep of ages fly,\r\nRoll the long sound through Eildon’s caverns vast,\r\nWhile each dark warrior kindles at the blast,\r\nThe horn, the falchion, grasp with mighty hand,\r\nAnd peal proud Arthur’s march from Fairy-land?”[*]\r\n\r\n\r\n[* Scenes of Infancy, Part I.]\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the same cabinet with the preceding fragment, the following occurred\r\namong other _disjecta membra_. It seems to be an attempt at a tale of a\r\ndifferent description from the last, but was almost instantly\r\nabandoned. The introduction points out the time of the composition to\r\nhave been about the end of the eighteenth century.\r\n\r\nTHE LORD OF ENNERDALE.\r\n\r\nIN A FRAGMENT OF A LETTER FROM JOHN B______, ESQ., OF THAT ILK, TO\r\nWILLIAM G______, F.R.S.E.\r\n\r\n\r\n“Fill a bumper,” said the knight; “the ladies may spare us a little\r\nlonger. Fill a bumper to the Archduke Charles.”\r\n\r\nThe company did due honour to the toast of their landlord.\r\n\r\n“The success of the archduke,” said the muddy vicar, “will tend to\r\nfurther our negotiation at Paris; and if—”\r\n\r\n“Pardon the interruption, Doctor,” quoth a thin, emaciated figure, with\r\nsomewhat of a foreign accent; “but why should you connect those events,\r\nunless to hope that the bravery and victories of our allies may\r\nsupersede the necessity of a degrading treaty?”\r\n\r\n“We begin to feel, Monsieur L’Abbé,” answered the vicar, with some\r\nasperity, “that a Continental war entered into for the defence of an\r\nally who was unwilling to defend himself, and for the restoration of a\r\nroyal family, nobility, and priesthood who tamely abandoned their own\r\nrights, is a burden too much even for the resources of this country.”\r\n\r\n“And was the war, then, on the part of Great Britain,” rejoined the\r\nAbbé, “a gratuitous exertion of generosity? Was there no fear of the\r\nwide-wasting spirit of innovation which had gone abroad? Did not the\r\nlaity tremble for their property, the clergy for their religion, and\r\nevery loyal heart for the Constitution? Was it not thought necessary to\r\ndestroy the building which was on fire, ere the conflagration spread\r\naround the vicinity?”\r\n\r\n“Yet if upon trial,” said the doctor, “the walls were found to resist\r\nour utmost efforts, I see no great prudence in persevering in our\r\nlabour amid the smouldering ruins.”\r\n\r\n“What, Doctor,” said the baronet, “must I call to your recollection\r\nyour own sermon on the late general fast? Did you not encourage us to\r\nhope that the Lord of Hosts would go forth with our armies, and that\r\nour enemies, who blasphemed him, should be put to shame?”\r\n\r\n“It may please a kind father to chasten even his beloved children,”\r\nanswered the vicar.\r\n\r\n“I think,” said a gentleman near the foot of the table, “that the\r\nCovenanters made some apology of the same kind for the failure of their\r\nprophecies at the battle of Danbar, when their mutinous preachers\r\ncompelled the prudent Lesley to go down against the Philistines in\r\nGilgal.”\r\n\r\nThe vicar fixed a scrutinizing and not a very complacent eye upon this\r\nintruder. He was a young man, of mean stature and rather a reserved\r\nappearance. Early and severe study had quenched in his features the\r\ngaiety peculiar to his age, and impressed upon them a premature cast of\r\nthoughtfulness. His eve had, however, retained its fire, and his\r\ngesture its animation. Had he remained silent, he would have been long\r\nunnoticed; but when he spoke, there was something in his manner which\r\narrested attention.\r\n\r\n“Who is this young man?” said the vicar, in a low voice, to his\r\nneighbour.\r\n\r\n“A Scotchman called Maxwell, on a visit to Sir Henry,” was the answer.\r\n\r\n“I thought so, from his accent and his manner,” said the vicar. It may\r\nbe here observed that the Northern English retain rather more of the\r\nancient hereditary aversion to their neighbors than their countrymen of\r\nthe South. The interference of other disputants, each of whom urged his\r\nopinion with all the vehemence of wine and politics, rendered the\r\nsummons to the drawing-room agreeable to the more sober part of the\r\ncompany.\r\n\r\nThe company dispersed by degrees, and at length the vicar and the young\r\nScotchman alone remained, besides the baronet, his lady, daughters, and\r\nmyself. The clergyman had not, it would seem, forgot the observation\r\nwhich ranked him with the false prophets of Dunbar, for he addressed\r\nMr. Maxwell upon the first opportunity.\r\n\r\n“Hem! I think, sir, you mentioned something about the civil wars of\r\nlast century. You must be deeply skilled in them indeed, if you can\r\ndraw any parallel betwixt those and the present evil days,—davs which I\r\nam ready to maintain are the most gloomy that ever darkened the\r\nprospects of Britain.”\r\n\r\n“God forbid, Doctor, that I should draw a comparison between the\r\npresent times and those you mention; I am too sensible of the\r\nadvantages we enjoy over our ancestors. Faction and ambition have\r\nintroduced division among us; but we are still free from the guilt of\r\ncivil bloodshed, and from all the evils which flow from it. Our foes,\r\nsir, are not those of our own household; and while we continue united\r\nand firm, from the attacks of a foreign enemy, however artful, or\r\nhowever inveterate, we have, I hope, little to dread.”\r\n\r\n“Have you found anything curious, Mr. Maxwell, among the dusty papers?”\r\nsaid Sir Henry, who seemed to dread a revival of political discussion.\r\n\r\n“My investigation amongst them led to reflection’s which I have just\r\nnow hinted,” said Maxwell; “and I think they are pretty strongly\r\nexemplified by a story which I have been endeavouring to arrange from\r\nsome of your family manuscripts.”\r\n\r\n“You are welcome to make what use of them you please,” said Sir Henry;\r\n“they have been undisturbed for many a day, and I have often wished for\r\nsome person as well skilled as you in these old pothooks, to tell me\r\ntheir meaning.”\r\n\r\n“Those I just mentioned,” answered Maxwell, “relate to a piece of\r\nprivate history savouring not a little of the marvellous, and\r\nintimately connected with your family; if it is agreeable, I can read\r\nto you the anecdotes in the modern shape into which I have been\r\nendeavouring to throw them, and you can then judge of the value of the\r\noriginals.”\r\n\r\nThere was something in this proposal agreeable to all parties. Sir\r\nHenry had family pride, which prepared him to take an interest in\r\nwhatever related to his ancestors. The ladies had dipped deeply into\r\nthe fashionable reading of the present day. Lady Ratcliff and her fair\r\ndaughters had climbed every pass, viewed every pine-shrouded ruin,\r\nheard every groan, and lifted every trap-door, in company with the\r\nnoted heroine of “Udolpho.” They had been heard, however, to observe\r\nthat the famous incident of the Black Veil singularly resembled the\r\nancient apologue of the Mountain in labour, so that they were\r\nunquestionably critics, as well as admirers. Besides all this, they had\r\nvalorously mounted _en croupe_ behind the ghostly horseman of Prague,\r\nthrough all his seven translators, and followed the footsteps of Moor\r\nthrough the forest of Bohemia. Moreover, it was even hinted (but this\r\nwas a greater mystery than all the rest) that a certain performance,\r\ncalled the “Monk,” in three neat volumes, had been seen by a prying\r\neye, in the right-hand drawer of the Indian cabinet of Lady Ratcliff’s\r\ndressing-room. Thus predisposed for wonders and signs, Lady Ratcliff\r\nand her nymphs drew their chairs round a large blazing wood-fire, and\r\narranged themselves to listen to the tale. To that fire I also\r\napproached, moved thereunto partly by the inclemency of the season, and\r\npartly that my deafness, which you know, cousin, I acquired during my\r\ncampaign under Prince Charles Edward, might be no obstacle to the\r\ngratification of my curiosity, which was awakened by what had any\r\nreference to the fate of such faithful followers of royalty as you well\r\nknow the house of Ratcliff have ever been. To this wood-fire the vicar\r\nlikewise drew near, and reclined himself conveniently in his chair,\r\nseemingly disposed to testify his disrespect for the narration and\r\nnarrator by falling asleep as soon as he conveniently could. By the\r\nside of Maxwell (by the way, I cannot learn that he is in the least\r\nrelated to the Nithsdale family) was placed a small table and a couple\r\nof lights, by the assistance of which he read as follows:—\r\n\r\n“Journal of Jan Von Eulen.\r\n\r\n\r\n“On the 6th November, 1645, I, Jan Von Enlen, merchant in Rotterdam,\r\nembarked with my only daughter on board of the good vessel ‘Vryheid,’\r\nof Amsterdam, in order to pass into the unhappy and disturbed kingdom\r\nof England.—7_th November_. A brisk gale; daughter sea-sick; myself\r\nunable to complete the calculation which I have begun, of the\r\ninheritance left by Jane Lansache, of Carlisle, my late dear wife’s\r\nsister, the collection of which is the object of my voyage.—8_th\r\nNovember_. Wind still stormy and adverse; a horrid disaster nearly\r\nhappened,—my dear child washed overboard as the vessel lurched to\r\nleeward.—Memorandum, to reward the young sailor who saved her, out of\r\nthe first moneys which I can recover from the inheritance of her aunt\r\nLansache.—9_th November_. Calm P.M. light breezes front N. N. W. I\r\ntalked with the captain about the inheritance of my sister-in-law, Jane\r\nLansache. He says he knows the principal subject, which will not exceed\r\n£1000 in value.—N. B. He is a cousin to a family of Petersons, which\r\nwas the name of the husband of my sister-in-law; so there is room to\r\nhope it may be worth more than be reports.—10_th November_, 10 A.M. May\r\nGod pardon all our sins! An English frigate, bearing the Parliament\r\nflag, has appeared in the offing, and gives chase.—11 A. M. She nears\r\nus every moment, and the captain of our vessel prepares to clear for\r\naction. May God again have mercy upon us!”\r\n\r\n\r\n“Here,” said Maxwell, “the journal with which I have opened the\r\nnarration ends somewhat abruptly.”\r\n\r\n“I am glad of it,” said Lady Ratcliff.\r\n\r\n“But, Mr. Maxwell,” said young Frank, Sir Henry’s grandchild, “shall we\r\nnot hear how the battle ended?”\r\n\r\nI do not know, cousin, whether I have not formerly made you acquainted\r\nwith the abilities of Frank Ratcliff. There is not a battle fought\r\nbetween the troops of the Prince and of the government, during the\r\nyears 1745–46, of which he is not able to give an account. It is true,\r\nI have taken particular pains to fix the events of this important\r\nperiod upon his memory by frequent repetition.\r\n\r\n“No, my dear,” said Maxwell, in answer to young Frank Itatcliff,—“No,\r\nmy dear, I cannot tell you the exact particulars of the engagement, but\r\nits consequences appear from the following letter, despatched by\r\nGarbonete Von Enlen, daughter of our journalist, to a relation in\r\nEngland, from whom she implored assistance. After some general account\r\nof the purpose of the voyage, and of the engagement, her narrative\r\nproceeds thus:—\r\n\r\n“The noise of the cannon had hardly ceased, before the sounds of a\r\nlanguage to me but half known, and the confusion on board our vessel,\r\ninformed me that the captors had boarded us and taken possession of our\r\nvessel. I went on deck, where the first spectacle that met my eyes was\r\na young man, mate of our vessel, who, though disfigured and covered\r\nwith blood, was loaded with irons, and whom they were forcing over the\r\nside of the vessel into a boat. The two principal persons among our\r\nenemies appeared to be a man of a tall, thin figure, with a\r\nhigh-crowned hat and long neck band, and short-cropped head of hair,\r\naccompanied by a bluff, open-looking elderly man in a naval uniform.\r\n‘Yarely! yarely! pull away, my hearts,’ said the latter, and the boat\r\nbearing the unlucky young man soon carried him on board the frigate.\r\nPerhaps you will blame me for mentioning this circumstance; but\r\nconsider, my dear cousin, this man saved my life, and his fate, even\r\nwhen my own and my father’s were in the balance, could not but affect\r\nme nearly.\r\n\r\n“‘In the name of him who is jealous, even to slaying,’ said the first—”\r\n\r\n\r\n_Cetera desunt_.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNo. II.\r\n\r\nCONCLUSION OF MR. STRUTT’S ROMANCE OF\r\nQUEEN-HOO HALL.\r\n\r\nBY THE AUTHOR OF WAVERLEY.\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IV.\r\n\r\nA HUNTING PARTY.—AN ADVENTURE.—A DELIVERANCE.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe next morning the bugles were sounded by daybreak in the court of\r\nLord Boteler’s mansion, to call the inhabitants from their slumbers, to\r\nassist in a splendid chase, with which the baron had resolved to\r\nentertain his neighbour Fitzallen and his noble visitor St. Clere.\r\nPeter Lanaret the falconer was in attendance, with falcons for the\r\nknights, and tiercelets for the ladies, if they should choose to vary\r\ntheir sport from hunting to hawking. Five stout yeomen keepers, with\r\ntheir attendants, called Bagged Robins, all meetly arrayed in Kendal\r\ngreen, with bugles and short hangers by their sides, and quarterstaffs\r\nin their hands, led the slow-hounds, or brackets, by which the deer\r\nwere to be put up. Ten brace of gallant greyhounds, each of which was\r\nfit to pluck down, singly, the tallest red deer, were led in leashes by\r\nas many of Lord Boteler’s foresters. The pages, squires, and other\r\nattendants of feudal splendour, well attired in their best\r\nhunting-gear, upon horseback or foot, according to their rank,—with\r\ntheir boar-spears, long bows, and cross-bows, were in seemly waiting.\r\n\r\nA numerous train of yeomen, called in the language of the times\r\nretainers, who yearly received a livery coat and a small pension for\r\ntheir attendance on such solemn occasions, appeared in cassocks of\r\nblue, bearing upon their arms the cognizance of the house of Boteler as\r\na badge of their adherence. They were the tallest men of their hands\r\nthat the neighbouring villages could supply, with every man his good\r\nbuckler on his shoulder, and a bright burnished broadsword dangling\r\nfrom his leathern belt. On this occasion they acted as rangers for\r\nbeating up the thickets and rousing the game. These attendants filled\r\nup the court of the castle, spacious as it was. On the green without,\r\nyou might have seen the motley assemblage of peasantry convened by\r\nreport of the splendid hunting, including most of our old acquaintances\r\nfrom Tewin, as well as the jolly partakers of good cheer at Hob\r\nFilcher’s. Gregory the jester, it may well be guessed, had no great\r\nmind to exhibit himself in public after his recent disaster; but Oswald\r\nthe steward, a great formalist in whatever concerned the public\r\nexhibition of his master’s household state, had positively enjoined his\r\nattendance. “What,” quoth he, “shall the house of the brave Lord\r\nBoteler, or such a brave day as this, be without a fool? Certes, the\r\ngood Lord St. Clere and his fair lady sister might think our\r\nhousekeeping as niggardly as that of their churlish kinsman at Gay\r\nBowers, who sent his father’s jester to the hospital, sold the poor\r\nsot’s bells for hawk-jesses, and made a nightcap of his long-eared\r\nbonnet. And, sirrah, let me see thee fool handsomely,—speak squibs and\r\ncrackers, instead of that dry, barren, musty gibing which thou hast\r\nused of late; or, by the bones! the porter shall have thee to his\r\nlodge, and cob thee with thine own wooden sword till thy skin is as\r\nmotley as thy doublet.”\r\n\r\nTo this stern injunction, Gregory made no reply, any more than to the\r\ncourteous offer of old Albert Drawslot, the chief park-keeper, who\r\nproposed to blow vinegar in his nose, to sharpen his wit, as he had\r\ndone that blessed morning to Bragger, the old hound, whose scent was\r\nfailing. There was, indeed, little time for reply, for the bugles,\r\nafter a lively flourish, were now silent, and Peretto, with his two\r\nattendant minstrels, stepping beneath the windows of the strangers’\r\napartments, joined in the following roundelay, the deep voices of the\r\nrangers and falconers making up a chorus that caused the very\r\nbattlements to ring again.\r\n\r\nWaken, lords and ladies gay,\r\nOn the mountain dawns the day;\r\nAll the jolly chase is here,\r\nWith hawk and horse and hunting-spear\r\nHounds are in their couples yelling,\r\nHawks are whistling, horns are knelling,\r\nMerrily, merrily, mingle they,\r\n“Waken, lords and ladies gay.”\r\n\r\nWaken, lords and ladies gay,\r\nThe mist has left the mountain gray;\r\nSpringlets in the dawn are streaming,\r\nDiamonds on the brake are gleaming,\r\nAnd foresters have busy been,\r\nTo track the buck in thicket green;\r\nNow we come to chant our lay:\r\n“Waken, lords and ladies gay.”\r\n\r\nWaken, lords and ladies gay,\r\nTo the green-wood haste away;\r\nWe can show you where he lies,\r\nFleet of foot, and tall of size;\r\nWe can show the marks he made\r\nWhen ’gainst the oak his antlers frayed;\r\nYou shall see him brought to bay,\r\n“Waken, lords and ladies gay.”\r\n\r\nLouder, louder chant the lay,\r\n“Waken, lords and ladies gay;”\r\nTell them, youth and mirth and glee\r\nRun a course as well as we.\r\nTime, stern huntsman, who can baulk,\r\nStaunch as hound, and fleet as hawk?\r\nThink of this, and rise with day,\r\nGentle lords and ladies gay.\r\n\r\n\r\nBy the time this lay was finished, Lord Boteler, with his daughter and\r\nkinsman, Fitzallen of Harden, and other noble guests had mounted their\r\npalfreys, and the hunt set forward in due order. The huntsmen, having\r\ncarefully observed the traces of a large stag on the preceding evening,\r\nwere able, without loss of time, to conduct the company, by the marks\r\nwhich they had made upon the trees, to the side of the thicket in\r\nwhich, by the report of Drawslot, he had harboured all night. The\r\nhorsemen spreading themselves along the side of the cover, waited until\r\nthe keeper entered, leading his bandog, a large blood-hound tied in a\r\nleam or band, from which he takes his name.\r\n\r\nBut it befell this. A hart of the second year, which was in the same\r\ncover with the proper object of their pursuit, chanced to be\r\nunharboured first, and broke cover very near where the Lady Emma and\r\nher brother were stationed. An inexperienced varlet, who was nearer to\r\nthem, instantly unloosed two tall greyhounds, who sprung after the\r\nfugitive with all the fleetness of the north wind. Gregory, restored a\r\nlittle to spirits by the enlivening scene around him, followed,\r\nencouraging the hounds with a loud tayout,[*] for which he had the\r\nhearty curses of the huntsman, as well as of the baron, who entered\r\ninto the spirit of the chase with all the juvenile ardour of twenty.\r\n“May the foul fiend, booted and spurred, ride down his bawling throat,\r\nwith a scythe at his girdle,” quoth Albert Drawslot; “here have I been\r\ntelling him that all the marks were those of a buck of the first head,\r\nand he has hollowed the hounds upon a velvet-headed knobbler! By Saint\r\nHubert, if I break not his pate with my cross-bow, may I never cast off\r\nhound more! But to it, my lords and masters! the noble beast is here\r\nyet, and, thank the saints, we have enough of hounds.”\r\n\r\n[* _Tailliers-hors;_ in modern phrase, Tally-ho]\r\n\r\n\r\nThe cover being now thoroughly beat by the attendants, the stag was\r\ncompelled to abandon it, and trust to his speed for his safety. Three\r\ngreyhounds were slipped upon him, whom he threw out, after running a\r\ncouple of miles, by entering an extensive furzy brake which extended\r\nalong the side of a hill. The horsemen soon came up, and casting off a\r\nsufficient number of slowhounds, sent them, with the prickers, into the\r\ncover, in order to chive the game from his strength. This object being\r\naccomplished, afforded another severe chase of several miles, in a\r\ndirection almost circular, during which the poor animal tried every\r\nwile to get rid of his persecutors. He crossed and traversed all such\r\ndusty paths as were likely to retain the least scent of his footsteps;\r\nhe laid himself close to the ground, drawing his feet under his belly,\r\nand clapping his nose close to the earth, lest he should be betrayed to\r\nthe hounds by his breath and hoofs. When all was in vain, and he found\r\nthe hounds coming fast in upon him, his own strength failing, his mouth\r\nembossed with foam, and the tears dropping from his eyes, he turned in\r\ndespair upon his pursuers, who then stood at gaze, making an hideous\r\nclamour, and awaiting their two-footed auxiliaries. Of these, it\r\nchanced that the Lady Eleanor, taking more pleasure in the sport than\r\nMatilda, and being a less burden to her palfrey than the Lord Boteler,\r\nwas the first who arrived at the spot, and taking a cross-bow from an\r\nattendant, discharged a bolt at the stag. When the infuriated animal\r\nfelt himself wounded, he pushed franticly towards her from whom he had\r\nreceived the shaft, and Lady Eleanor might have had occasion to repent\r\nof her enterprise had not young Fitzallen, who had kept near her during\r\nthe whole day, at that instant galloped briskly in, and ere the stag\r\ncould change his object of assault, despatched him with his short\r\nhunting-sword.\r\n\r\nAlbert Drawslot, who had just come up in terror for the young lady’s\r\nsafety, broke out into loud encomiums upon Fitzallen’s strength and\r\ngallantry. “By ’r Lady,” said he, taking off his cap, and wiping his\r\nsun-burnt face with his sleeve, “well struck, and in good time! But\r\nnow, boys, doff your bonnets, and sound the mort.”\r\n\r\nThe sportsmen then sounded a treble mort and set up a general whoop,\r\nwhich, mingled with the yelping of the dogs, made the welkin ring\r\nagain. The huntsman then offered his knife to Lord Boteler, that he\r\nmight take the say of the deer; but the baron courteously insisted upon\r\nFitzallen going through that ceremony. The Lady Matilda was now come\r\nup, with most of the attendants; and the interest of the chase being\r\nended, it excited some surprise that neither St. Clere nor his sister\r\nmade their appearance. The Lord Boteler commanded the horns again to\r\nsound the recheat, in hopes to call in the stragglers, and said to\r\nFitzallen: “Methinks St. Clere, so distinguished for service in war,\r\nshould have been more forward in the chase.”\r\n\r\n“I trow,” said Peter Lanaret, “I know the reason of the noble lord’s\r\nabsence; for when that moon-calf, Gregory, hallooed the dogs upon the\r\nknobbler, and galloped like a green hilding, as he is, after them, I\r\nsaw the Lady Emma’s palfrey follow apace after that varlet, who should\r\nbe trashed for overrunning, and I think her noble brother has followed\r\nher, lest she should come to harm. But here, by the rood, is Gregory to\r\nanswer for himself.”\r\n\r\nAt this moment Gregory entered the circle which had been formed round\r\nthe deer, out of breath, and his face covered with blood. He kept for\r\nsome time uttering inarticulate cries of “Harrow!” and “Wellaway!” and\r\nother exclamations of distress and terror, pointing all the while to a\r\nthicket at some distance from the spot where the deer had been killed.\r\n\r\n“By my honour,” said the baron, “I would gladly know who has dared to\r\narray the poor knave thus; and I trust he should dearly aby his\r\n_outrecuidance_, were he the best, save one, in England.”\r\n\r\nGregory, who had now found more breath, cried, “Help, an ye be men!\r\nSave Lady Emma and her brother, whom they are murdering in Brockenhurst\r\nthicket.”\r\n\r\nThis put all in motion. Lord Boteler hastily commanded a small party of\r\nhis men to abide for the defence of the ladies, while he himself,\r\nFitzallen, and the rest made what speed they could towards the thicket,\r\nguided by Gregory, who for that purpose was mounted behind Fabian.\r\nPushing through a narrow path, the first object they encountered was a\r\nman of small stature lying on the ground, mastered and almost strangled\r\nby two dogs, which were instantly recognized to be those that had\r\naccompanied Gregory. A little farther was an open space, where lay\r\nthree bodies of dead or wounded men; beside these was Lady Emma,\r\napparently lifeless, her brother and a young forester bending over and\r\nendeavouring to recover her. By employing the usual remedies, this was\r\nsoon accomplished; while Lord Boteler, astonished at such a scene,\r\nanxiously inquired at St. Clere the meaning of what he saw, and whether\r\nmore danger was to be expected?\r\n\r\n“For the present, I trust not,” said the young warrior, who they now\r\nobserved was slightly wounded; “but I pray you, of your nobleness, let\r\nthe woods here be searched; for we were assaulted by four of these base\r\nassassins, and I see three only on the sward.”\r\n\r\nThe attendants now brought forward the person whom they had rescued\r\nfrom the dogs, and Henry, with disgust, shame, and astonishment,\r\nrecognized his kinsman, Gaston St. Clere. This discovery he\r\ncommunicated in a whisper to Lord Boteler, who commanded the prisoner\r\nto be conveyed to Queen-Hoo Hall and closely guarded; meanwhile he\r\nanxiously inquired of young St. Clere about his wound. “A scratch, a\r\ntrifle!” cried Henry; “I am in less haste to bind it than to introduce\r\nto you one without whose aid that of the leech would have come too\r\nlate. Where is he? Where is my brave deliverer?”\r\n\r\n“Here, most noble lord,” said Gregory, sliding from his palfrey and\r\nstepping forward, “ready to receive the guerdon which your bounty would\r\nheap on him.”\r\n\r\n“Truly, friend Gregory,” answered the young warrior, “thou shalt not be\r\nforgotten; for thou didst run speedily and roar manfully for aid,\r\nwithout which, I think verily, we had not received it. But the brave\r\nforester who came to my rescue when these three ruffians had nigh\r\noverpowered me, where is he?”\r\n\r\nEvery one looked around; but though all had seen him on entering the\r\nthicket, he was not now to be found. They could only conjecture that he\r\nhad retired during the confusion occasioned by the detention of Gaston.\r\n\r\n“Seek not for him,” said the Lady Emma, who had now in some degree\r\nrecovered her composure; “he will not be found of mortal, unless at his\r\nown season.”\r\n\r\nThe baron, convinced from this answer that her terror had, for the\r\ntime, somewhat disturbed her reason, forebore to question her; and\r\nMatilda and Eleanor, to whom a message had been despatched with the\r\nresult of this strange adventure, arriving, they took the Lady Emma\r\nbetween them, and all in a body returned to the castle.\r\n\r\nThe distance was, however, considerable, and before reaching it they\r\nhad another alarm. The prickers, who rode foremost in the troop,\r\nhalted, and announced to the Lord Boteler, that they perceived\r\nadvancing towards them a body of armed men. The followers of the baron\r\nwere numerous, but they were arrayed for the chase, not for battle; and\r\nit was with great pleasure that he discerned, on the pennon of the\r\nadvancing body of men-at-arms, instead of the cognizance of Gaston, as\r\nhe had some reason to expect, the friendly bearings of Fitzosborne of\r\nDiggswell, the same young lord who was present at the May-games with\r\nFitzallen of Marden. The knight himself advanced, sheathed in armour,\r\nand, without raising his visor, informed Lord Boteler, that having\r\nheard of a base attempt made upon a part of his train by ruffianly\r\nassassins, he had mounted and armed a small party of his retainers, to\r\nescort them to Queen-Hoo Hall. Having received and accepted an\r\ninvitation to attend them thither, they prosecuted their journey in\r\nconfidence and security, and arrived safe at home without any further\r\naccident.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER V.\r\n\r\nINVESTIGATION OF THE ADVENTURE OF THE HUNTING.—A DISCOVERY.\r\n—GREGORY’S MANHOOD.—FATE OF GASTON ST. CLERE.—CONCLUSION.\r\n\r\nSo soon as they arrived at the princely mansion of Boteler, the Lady\r\nEmma craved permission to retire to her chamber, that she might compose\r\nher spirits after the terror she had undergone. Henry St. Clere, in a\r\nfew words, proceeded to explain the adventure to the curious audience.\r\n“I had no sooner seen my sister’s palfrey, in spite of her endeavours\r\nto the contrary, entering with spirit into the chase set on foot by the\r\nworshipful Gregory than I rode after to give her assistance. So long\r\nwas the chase that when the greyhounds pulled down the knobbler, we\r\nwere out of hearing of your bugles; and having rewarded and coupled the\r\ndogs, I gave them to be led by the jester, and we wandered in quest of\r\nour company, whom, it would seem, the sport had led in a different\r\ndirection. At length, passing through the thicket where you found us, I\r\nwas surprised by a cross-bow bolt whizzing past mine head. I drew my\r\nsword and rushed into the thicket, but was instantly assailed by two\r\nruffians, while other two made towards my sister and Gregory. The poor\r\nknave fled, crying for help, pursued by my false kinsman, now your\r\nprisoner; and the designs of the other on my poor Emma (murderous no\r\ndoubt) were prevented by the sudden apparition of a brave woodsman,\r\nwho, after a short encounter, stretched the miscreant at his feet and\r\ncame to my assistance. I was already slightly wounded, and nearly\r\noverlaid with odds. The combat lasted some time, for the caitiffs were\r\nboth well armed, strong, and desperate; at length, however, we had each\r\nmastered our antagonist, when your retinue, my Lord Boteler, arrived to\r\nmy relief. So ends in my story; but, on my knighthood, I would give an\r\nearl’s ransom for an opportunity of thanking the gallant forester by\r\nwhose aid I live to tell it.”\r\n\r\n“Fear not,” said Lord Boteler; “he shall be found if this or the four\r\nadjacent counties hold him. And now Lord Fitzosborne will be pleased to\r\ndoff the armour he has so kindly assumed for our sakes, and we will all\r\nbowne ourselves for the banquet.”\r\n\r\nWhen the hour of dinner approached, the Lady Matilda and her cousin\r\nvisited the chamber of the fair Darcy. They found her in a composed but\r\nmelancholy posture. She turned the discourse upon the misfortunes of\r\nher life, and hinted that having recovered her brother, and seeing him\r\nlook forward to the society of one who would amply repay to him the\r\nloss of hers, she had thoughts of dedicating her remaining life to\r\nHeaven, by whose providential interference it had been so often\r\npreserved.\r\n\r\nMatilda coloured deeply at something in this speech, and her cousin\r\ninveighed loudly against Emma’s resolution. “Ah, my dear Lady Eleanor,”\r\nreplied she, “I have to-day witnessed what I cannot but judge a\r\nsupernatural visitation, and to what end can it call me but to give\r\nmyself to the altar? That peasant who guided me, to Baddow through the\r\nPark of Danbury, the same who appeared before me at different times and\r\nin different forms during that eventful journey,—that youth, whose\r\nfeatures are imprinted on my memory, is the very individual forester\r\nwho this day rescued us in the forest. I cannot be mistaken; and\r\nconnecting these marvellous appearances with the spectre which I saw\r\nwhile at Gay Bowers, I cannot resist the conviction that Heaven has\r\npermitted my guardian angel to assume mortal shape for my relief and\r\nprotection.”\r\n\r\nThe fair cousins, after exchanging looks which implied a fear that her\r\nmind was wandering, answered her in soothing terms, and finally\r\nprevailed upon her to accompany them to the banqueting-hall. Here the\r\nfirst person they encountered was the Baron Fitzosborne of Diggswell,\r\nnow divested of his armour; at the sight of whom the Lady Emma changed\r\ncolour, and exclaiming, “It is the same!” sunk senseless into the arms\r\nof Matilda.\r\n\r\n“She is bewildered by the terrors of the day,” said Eleanor; “and we\r\nhave done ill in obliging her to descend.”\r\n\r\n“And I,” said Fitzosborne, “have done madly in presenting before her\r\none whose presence must recall moments the most alarming in her life.”\r\n\r\nWhile the ladies supported Emma from the hall, Lord Boteler and St.\r\nClere requested an explanation from Fitzosborne of the words he had\r\nused.\r\n\r\n“Trust me, gentle lords,” said the Baron of Diggswell, “ye shall have\r\nwhat ye demand, when I learn that Lady Emma Darcy has not suffered from\r\nmy imprudence.”\r\n\r\nAt this moment Lady Matilda, returning, said that her fair friend, on\r\nher recovery, had calmly and deliberately insisted that she had seen\r\nFitzosborne before, in the most dangerous crisis of her life.\r\n\r\n“I dread,” said she, “her disordered mind connects all that her eye\r\nbeholds with the terrible passages that she has witnessed.”\r\n\r\n“Nay,” said Fitzosborne, “if noble St. Clere can pardon the\r\nunauthorized interest which, with the purest and most honourable\r\nintentions, I have taken in his sister’s fate, it is easy for me to\r\nexplain this mysterious impression.”\r\n\r\nHe proceeded to say that, happening to be in the hostelry called the\r\nGriffin, near Baddow, while upon a journey in that country, he had met\r\nwith the old nurse of the Lady Emma Darcy, who, being just expelled\r\nfront Gay Bowers, was in the height of her grief and indignation, and\r\nmade loud and public proclamation of Lady Emma’s wrongs. From the\r\ndescription she gave of the beauty of her foster-child, as well as from\r\nthe spirit of chivalry, Fitzosborne became interested in her fate. This\r\ninterest was deeply enhanced when, by a bribe to Old Gaunt the Reve, he\r\nprocured a view of the Lady Emma as she walked near the castle of Gay\r\nBowers. The aged churl refused to give him access to the castle, yet\r\ndropped some hints, as if he thought the lady in danger, and wished she\r\nwere well out of it. His master, he said, had heard she had a brother\r\nin life, and since that deprived him of all chance of gaining her\r\ndomains by purchase, he, in short, Gaunt wished they were safely\r\nseparated. “If any injury,” quoth he, “should happen to the damsel\r\nhere, it were ill for us all. I tried, by an innocent stratagem, to\r\nfrighten her from the castle by introducing a figure through a\r\ntrap-door and warning her, as if by a voice from the dead, to retreat\r\nfrom thence; but the giglet is wilful, and is running upon her fate.”\r\n\r\nFinding Gaunt, although covetous and communicative, too faithful a\r\nservant to his wicked master to take any active steps against his\r\ncommands, Fitzosborne applied himself to old Ursely, whom he found more\r\ntractable. Through her he learned the dreadful plot Gaston had laid to\r\nrid himself of his kinswoman, and resolved to effect her deliverance.\r\nBut aware of the delicacy of Emma’s situation, he charged Ursely to\r\nconceal from her the interest he took in her distress, resolving to\r\nwatch over her in disguise until he saw her in a place of safety. Hence\r\nthe appearance he made before her in various dresses during her\r\njourney, in the course of which he was never far distant; and he had\r\nalways four stout yeomen within hearing of his bugle, had assistance\r\nbeen necessary. When she was placed in safety at the lodge, it was\r\nFitzosborne’s intention to have prevailed upon his sisters to visit,\r\nand take her under their protection; but he found them absent from\r\nDiggswell, having gone to attend an aged relation who lay dangerously\r\nill in a distant county. They did not return until the day before the\r\nMay-games; and the other events followed too rapidly to permit\r\nFitzosborne to lay any plan for introducing them to Lady Emma Darcy. On\r\nthe day of the chase he resolved to preserve his romantic disguise and\r\nattend the Lady Emma as a forester, partly to have the pleasure of\r\nbeing near her, and partly to judge whether, according to an idle\r\nreport in the country, she favoured his friend and comrade Fitzallen of\r\nMarden. This last motive, it may easily be believed, he did not declare\r\nto the company. After the skirmish with the ruffians, he waited till\r\nthe baron and the hunters arrived, and then, still doubting the further\r\ndesigns of Gaston, hastened to his castle to arm the band which had\r\nescorted them to Queen-Hoo Hall.\r\n\r\nFitzosborne’s story being finished, he received the thanks of all the\r\ncompany, particularly of St. Clere, who felt deeply the respectful\r\ndelicacy with which he had conducted himself towards his sister. The\r\nlady was carefully informed of her obligations to him; and it is left\r\nto the well-judging reader whether even the raillery of Lady Eleanor\r\nmade her regret that Heaven had only employed natural means for her\r\nsecurity, and that the guardian angel was converted into a handsome,\r\ngallant, and enamoured knight.\r\n\r\nThe joy of the company in the hall extended itself to the buttery,\r\nwhere Gregory the jester narrated such feats of arms done by himself in\r\nthe fray of the morning as might have shamed Bevis and Guy of Warwick.\r\nHe was, according to his narrative, singled out for destruction by the\r\ngigantic baron himself, while he abandoned to meaner hands the\r\ndestruction of St. Clere and Fitzosborne.\r\n\r\n“But, certes,” said he, “the foul paynim met his match; for, ever as he\r\nfoined at me with his brand, I parried his blows with my bauble, and\r\nclosing with him upon the third veny, threw him to the ground, and made\r\nhim cryrecreant to an unarmed man.”\r\n\r\n“Tush, man!” said Drawslot, “thou forgettest thy best auxiliaries, the\r\ngood greyhounds, Help and Holdfast! I warrant thee that when the\r\nhumpbacked baron caught thee by the cowl, which he hath almost torn\r\noff, thou hadst been in a fair plight, had they not remembered an old\r\nfriend and come in to the rescue. Why, man, I found them fastened on\r\nhim myself; and there was odd staving and stickling to make them ‘ware\r\nhaunch!’ Their mouths were full of the flex, for I pulled a piece of\r\nthe garment from their jaws. I warrant thee that when they brought him\r\nto ground, thou fledst like a frighted pricket.”\r\n\r\n“And as for Gregory’s gigantic paynim,” said Fabian, “why, he lies\r\nyonder in the guard-room, the very size, shape, and colour of a spider\r\nin a yewhedge.”\r\n\r\n“It is false!” said Gregory; “Colbrand the Dane was a dwarf to him.”\r\n\r\n“It is as true,” returned Fabian, “as that the Tasker is to be married\r\non Tuesday to pretty Margery. Gregory, thy sheet hath brought them\r\nbetween a pair of blankets.”\r\n\r\n“I care no more for such a gillflirt,” said the Jester, “than I do for\r\nthy leasings. Marry, thou hop-o’-my-thumb, happy wouldst thou be could\r\nthy head reach the captive baron’s girdle.”\r\n\r\n“By the Mass,” said Peter Lanaret, “I will have one peep at this burly\r\ngallant;” and leaving the buttery, he went to the guard-room where\r\nGaston St. Clere was confined. A man-at-arms, who kept sentinel on the\r\nstrong studded door of the apartment, said he believed he slept; for\r\nthat after raging, stamping, and uttering the most horrid imprecations,\r\nhe had been of late perfectly still. The falconer gently drew back a\r\nsliding board, of a foot square, towards the top of the door, which\r\ncovered a hole of the same size, strongly latticed, through which the\r\nwarder, without opening the door, could look in upon his prisoner. From\r\nthis aperture he beheld the wretched Gaston suspended by the neck, by\r\nhis own girdle, to an iron ring in the side of his prison. He had\r\nclambered to it by means of the table on which his food had been\r\nplaced; and in the agonies of shame and disappointed malice, had\r\nadopted this mode of ridding himself of a wretched life. He was found\r\nyet warm, but totally lifeless. A proper account of the manner of his\r\ndeath was drawn up and certified. He was buried that evening in the\r\nchapel of the castle, out of respect to his high birth; and the\r\nchaplain of Fitzallen of Marden, who said the service upon the\r\noccasion, preached, the next Sunday, an excellent sermon upon the text,\r\n“Radix malorum est cupiditas,” which we have here transcribed.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Here the manuscript from which we have painfully transcribed, and\r\nfrequently, as it were, translated this tale, for the reader’s\r\nedification, is so indistinct and defaced that, excepting certain\r\n“howbeits,” “nathlesses,” “lo ye’s!” etc. we can pick out little that\r\nis intelligible, saving that avarice is defined “a likourishness of\r\nheart after earthly things.”] A little farther there seems to have been\r\na gay account of Margery’s wedding with Ralph the Tasker, the running\r\nat the quintain, and other rural games practised on the occasion. There\r\nare also fragments of a mock sermon preached by Gregory upon that\r\noccasion, as for example:—\r\n\r\n“Mv dear cursed caitiffs, there was once a king, and he wedded a young\r\nold queen, and she had a child; and this child was sent to Solomon the\r\nSage, praying he would give it the same blessing which he got from the\r\nwitch of Endor when she bit him by the heel. Hereof speaks the worthy\r\nDr. Radigundus Potator. Why should not Mass be said for all the roasted\r\nshoe souls served up in the king’s dish on Saturday? For true it is\r\nthat Saint Peter asked father Adam, as they journeyed to Camelot, an\r\nhigh, great, and doubtful question: ‘Adam, Adam, why eated’st thou the\r\napple without paring?’”[*]\r\n\r\n[* This tirade of gibberish is literally taken or selected from a mock\r\ndiscourse pronounced by a professed jester, which occurs in an ancient\r\nmanuscript in the Advocates’ Library, the same from which the late\r\ningenious Mr. Weber published the curious comic romance of the\r\n“Limiting of the Hare.” It was introduced in compliance with Mr.\r\nStrutt’s plan of rendering his tale an illustration of ancient manners.\r\nA similar burlesque sermon is pronounced by the Fool in Sir David\r\nLindesay’s satire of the “Three Estates.” The nonsense and vulgar\r\nburlesque of that composition illustrate the ground of Sir Andrew,\r\nAguecheek’s eulogy on the exploits of the jester in “Twelfth Night,”\r\nwho, reserving his sharper jests for Sir Toby, had doubtless enough of\r\nthe jargon of his calling to captivate the imbecility of his brother\r\nknight, who is made to exclaim: “In sooth, thou wast in very gracious\r\nfooling last night when thou spokest of Pigrogremitus, and of the\r\nvapours passing the equinoctials of Quenbus; ’t was very good, i’\r\nfaith!” It is entertaining to find commentators seeking to discover\r\nsome meaning in the professional jargon of such a passage as this.]\r\n\r\n\r\nWith much goodly gibberish to the same effect, which display of\r\nGregory’s ready wit not only threw the whole company into convulsions\r\nof laughter, but made such an impression on Rose, the Potter’s\r\ndaughter, that it was thought it would be the jester’s own fault if\r\nJack was long without his Jill. Much pithy matter concerning the\r\nbringing the bride to bed, the loosing the bridegroom’s points, the\r\nscramble which ensued for them, and the casting of the stocking, is\r\nalso omitted, from its obscurity.\r\n\r\nThe following song, which has been since borrowed by the worshipful\r\nauthor of the famous “History of Fryar Bacon,” has been with difficulty\r\ndeciphered. It seems to have been sung on occasion of carrying home the\r\nbride.\r\n\r\nBRIDAL SONG.\r\n\r\n\r\n_To the tune of “I have been a Fiddler,” etc._\r\n\r\n\r\nAnd did you not hear of a mirth befell\r\n    The morrow after a wedding-day,\r\nAnd carrying a bride at home to dwell?\r\n    And away to Tewin, away, away!\r\n\r\nThe quintain was set, and the garlands were made,—\r\n    ’T is pity old customs should ever decay;\r\nAnd woe be to him that was horsed on a jade,\r\n    For he carried no credit away, away.\r\n\r\nWe met a consort of fiddle-de-dees;\r\n    We set them a cockhorse, and made them play\r\nThe winning of Bullen, and Upsey-fires,\r\n    And away to Tewin, away, away!\r\n\r\nThere was ne’er a lad in all the parish\r\n    That would go to the plough that day;\r\nBut on his fore-horse his wench he carries,\r\n    And away to Tewin, away, away!\r\n\r\nThe butler was quick, and the ale he did tap,\r\n    The maidens did make the chamber full gay;\r\nThe servants did give me a fuddling cup,\r\n    And I did carry ’t away, away.\r\n\r\nThe smith of the town his liquor so took\r\n    That he was persuaded that the ground looked blue;\r\nAnd I dare boldly be sworn on a book\r\n    Such smiths as he there’s but a few.\r\n\r\nA posset was made, and the women did sip,\r\n    And simpering said they could eat no more;\r\nFull many a maiden was laid on the lip,—\r\n    I’ll say no more, but give o’er (give o’er).\r\n\r\n\r\nBut what our fair readers will chiefly regret is the loss of three\r\ndeclarations of love: the first by St. Clore to Matilda, which, with\r\nthe lady’s answer, occupies fifteen closely written pages of\r\nmanuscript. That of Fitzosborne to Emma is not much shorter; but the\r\namours of Fitzallen and Eleanor, being of a less romantic cast, are\r\nclosed in three pages only. The three noble couples were married in\r\nQueen-Hoo Hall upon the same day, being the twentieth Sunday after\r\nEaster. There is a prolix account of the marriage-feast, of which we\r\ncan pick out the names of a few dishes, such as peterel, crane,\r\nsturgeon, swan, etc., with a profusion of wild-fowl and venison. We\r\nalso see that a suitable song was produced by Peretto on the occasion,\r\nand that the bishop, who blessed the bridal beds which received the\r\nhappy couples, was no niggard of his holy water, bestowing half a\r\ngallon upon each of the couches. We regret we cannot give these\r\ncuriosities to the reader in detail, but we hope to expose the\r\nmanuscript to abler antiquaries, so soon as it shall be framed and\r\nglazed by the ingenious artist who rendered that service to Mr.\r\nIreland’s Shakspeare manuscripts. And so (being unable to lay aside the\r\nstyle to which our pen is habituated), gentle reader, we bid thee\r\nheartily farewell.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNo. III.\r\n\r\nANECDOTE OF SCHOOL DAYS,\r\nUPON WHICH MR. THOMAS SCOTT PROPOSED TO FOUND A TALE OF FICTION.\r\n\r\nIt is well known in the South that there is little or no boxing at the\r\nScottish schools. About forty or fifty years ago, however, a far more\r\ndangerous mode of fighting, in parties or factions, was permitted in\r\nthe streets of Edinburgh, to the great disgrace of the police, and\r\ndanger of the parties concerned. These parties were generally formed\r\nfrom the quarters of the town in which the combatants resided, those of\r\na particular square or district fighting against those of an adjoining\r\none. Hence it happened that the children of the higher classes were\r\noften pitted against those of the lower, each taking their side\r\naccording to the residence of their friends. So far as I recollect,\r\nhowever, it was unmingled either with feelings of democracy or\r\naristocracy, or, indeed, with malice or ill-will of any kind towards\r\nthe opposite party. In fact, it was only a rough mode of play. Such\r\ncontests were, however, maintained with great vigour with stones and\r\nsticks and fisticuffs, when one party dared to charge, and the other\r\nstood their ground. Of course mischief sometimes happened; boys are\r\nsaid to have been killed at these “bickers,” as they were called, and\r\nserious accidents certainly took place, as many contemporaries can bear\r\nwitness.\r\n\r\nThe Author’s father residing in George Square, in the southern side of\r\nEdinburgh, the boys belonging to that family, with others in the\r\nsquare, were arranged into a sort of company, to which a lady of\r\ndistinction presented a handsome set of colours. Now this company, or\r\nregiment, as a matter of course, was engaged in weekly warfare with the\r\nboys inhabiting the Crosscauseway, Bristo Street, the Potter Row,—in\r\nshort, the neighbouring suburbs. These last were chiefly of the lower\r\nrank, but hardy loons, who threw stones to a hair’s-breadth, and were\r\nvery rugged antagonists at close quarters. The skirmish sometimes\r\nlasted for a whole evening, until one party or the other was\r\nvictorious, when, if ours were successful, we drove the enemy to their\r\nquarters, and were usually chased back by the reinforcement of bigger\r\nlads who came to their assistance. If, on the contrary, we were\r\npursued, as was often the case, into the precincts of our square, we\r\nwere in our turn supported by our elder brothers, domestic servants,\r\nand similar auxiliaries.\r\n\r\nIt followed, from our frequent opposition to each other, that though\r\nnot knowing the names of our enemies, we were yet well acquainted with\r\ntheir appearance, and had nicknames for the most remarkable of them.\r\nOne very active and spirited boy might be considered as the principal\r\nleader in the cohort of the suburbs. He was, I suppose, thirteen or\r\nfourteen years old, finely made, tall, blue-eyed, with long fair hair,\r\nthe very picture of a youthful Goth. This lad was always first in the\r\ncharge, and last in the retreat,—the Achilles, at once, and Ajax of the\r\nCrosscauseway. He was too formidable to us not to have a cognomen, and,\r\nlike that of a knight of old, it was taken from the most remarkable\r\npart of his dress, being a pair of old green livery breeches, which was\r\nthe principal part of his clothing; for, like Pentapolin, according to\r\nDon Quixote’s account, Green-Breeks, as we called him, always entered\r\nthe battle with bare arms, legs, and feet.\r\n\r\nIt fell that once upon a time, when the combat was at the thickest,\r\nthis plebeian champion headed a sudden charge so rapid and furious that\r\nall fled before him. He was several paces before his comrades, and had\r\nactually laid his hands on the patrician standard, when one of our\r\nparty, whom some misjudging friend had intrusted with a _couteau de\r\nchasse_, or hanger, inspired with a zeal for the honour of the corps\r\nworthy of Major Sturgeon himself, struck poor Green-Breeks over the\r\nhead with strength sufficient to cut him down. When this was seen, the\r\ncasualty was so far beyond what had ever taken place before that both\r\nparties fled different ways, leaving poor Green-Breeks, with his bright\r\nhair plentifully dabbled in blood, to the care of the watchman, who\r\n(honest man) took care not to know who had done the mischief. The\r\nbloody hanger was flung into one of the Meadow ditches, and solemn\r\nsecrecy was sworn on all hands; but the remorse and terror of the actor\r\nwere beyond all bounds, and his apprehensions of the most dreadful\r\ncharacter. The wounded hero was for a few days in the Infirmary, the\r\ncase being only a trifling one. But though inquiry was strongly pressed\r\non him, no argument could make him indicate the person from whom he had\r\nreceived the wound, though he must have been perfectly well known to\r\nhim. When he recovered, and was dismissed, the author and his brothers\r\nopened a communication with him, through the medium of a popular\r\ngingerbread baker, of whom both parties were customers, in order to\r\ntender a subsidy in name of smart-money. The sum would excite ridicule\r\nwere I to name it; but sure I am that the pockets of the noted\r\nGreen-Breeks never held as much money of his own. He declined the\r\nremittance, saying that he would not sell his blood, but at the same\r\ntime reprobated the idea of being an informer, which, he said, was\r\n“clam,” i.e., base or mean. With much urgency, he accepted a pound of\r\nsnuff for the use of some old woman—aunt, grandmother, or the like—with\r\nwhom he lived. We did not become friends, for the _bickers_ were more\r\nagreeable to both parties than any more pacific amusement; but we\r\nconducted them ever after under mutual assurances of the highest\r\nconsideration for each other.\r\n\r\nSuch was the hero whom Mr. Thomas Scott proposed to carry to Canada and\r\ninvolve in adventures with the natives and colonists of that country.\r\nPerhaps the youthful generosity of the lad will not seem so great in\r\nthe eyes of others as to those whom it was the means of screening from\r\nsevere rebuke and punishment. But it seemed, to those concerned, to\r\nargue a nobleness of sentiment far beyond the pitch of most minds; and\r\nhowever obscurely the lad, who showed such a frame of noble spirit, may\r\nhave lived or died, I cannot help being of opinion, that if fortune had\r\nplaced him in circumstances calling for gallantry or generosity, the\r\nman would have fulfilled the promises of the boy. Long afterwards, when\r\nthe story was told to my father, he censured us severely for not\r\ntelling the truth at the time, that he might have attempted to be of\r\nuse to the young man in entering on life. But our alarms for the\r\nconsequences of the drawn sword, and the wound inflicted with such a\r\nweapon, were far too predominant at the time for such a pitch of\r\ngenerosity.\r\n\r\nPerhaps I ought not to have inserted this schoolboy tale; but besides\r\nthe strong impression made by the incident at the time, the whole\r\naccompaniments of the story are matters to me of solemn and sad\r\nrecollection. Of all the little band who were concerned in those\r\njuvenile sports or brawls, I can scarce recollect a single survivor.\r\nSome left the ranks of mimic war to die in the active service of their\r\ncountry. Many sought distant lands, to return no more. Others,\r\ndispersed in different paths of life, “my dim eyes now seek for in\r\nvain.” Of five brothers, all healthy and promising in a degree far\r\nbeyond one whose infancy was visited by personal infirmity, and whose\r\nhealth after this period seemed long very precarious, I am,\r\nnevertheless, the only survivor. The best loved, and the best deserving\r\nto be loved, who had destined this incident to be the foundation of\r\nliterary composition, died “before his day,” in a distant and foreign\r\nland; and trifles assume an importance not their own, when connected\r\nwith those who have been loved and lost.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWAVERLEY;\r\n\r\nOR,\r\n\r\n’T IS SIXTY YEARS SINCE.\r\n\r\n\r\n“Under which King, Bezonian? Speak, or die!”\r\nHenry IV., Part II.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEDITOR’S INTRODUCTION TO WAVERLEY.\r\n\r\n\r\n“What is the value of a reputation that probably will not last above\r\none or two generations?” Sir Walter Scott once asked Ballantyne. Two\r\ngenerations, according to the usual reckoning, have passed; “’T is\r\nSixty Years since” the “wondrous Potentate” of Wordsworth’s sonnet\r\ndied, yet the reputation on which he set so little store survives. A\r\nconstant tide of new editions of his novels flows from the press; his\r\nplots give materials for operas and plays; he has been criticised,\r\npraised, condemned: but his romances endure amid the changes of taste,\r\nremaining the delight of mankind, while new schools and little masters\r\nof fiction come and go.\r\n\r\nScott himself believed that even great works usually suffer periods of\r\ntemporary occultation. His own, no doubt, have not always been in their\r\nprimitive vogue. Even at first, English readers complained of the\r\ndifficulty caused by his Scotch, and now many make his “dialect” an\r\nexcuse for not reading books which their taste, debauched by third-rate\r\nfiction, is incapable of enjoying. But Scott has never disappeared in\r\none of those irregular changes of public opinion remarked on by his\r\nfriend Lady Louisa Stuart. In 1821 she informed him that she had tried\r\nthe experiment of reading Mackenzie’s “Man of Feeling” aloud: “Nobody\r\ncried, and at some of the touches I used to think so exquisite, they\r\nlaughed.”[*] His correspondent requested Scott to write something on\r\nsuch variations of taste, which actually seem to be in the air and\r\nepidemic, for they affect, as she remarked, young people who have not\r\nheard the criticisms of their elders.[**] Thus Rousseau’s “Nouvelle\r\nHéloïse,” once so fascinating to girls, and reputed so dangerous, had\r\nbecome tedious to the young, Lady Louisa says, even in 1821. But to the\r\nyoung, if they have any fancy and intelligence, Scott is not tedious\r\neven now; and probably his most devoted readers are boys, girls, and\r\nmen of matured appreciation and considerable knowledge of literature.\r\nThe unformed and the cultivated tastes are still at one about Scott. He\r\nholds us yet with his unpremeditated art, his natural qualities of\r\nfriendliness, of humour, of sympathy. Even the carelessness with which\r\nhis earliest and his kindest critics—Ellis, Erskine, and Lady Louisa\r\nStuart—reproached him has not succeeded in killing his work and\r\ndiminishing his renown.\r\n\r\n[* Abbotsford Manuscripts.]\r\n\r\n\r\n[** See Scott’s reply, with the anecdote about Mrs. Aphra Behn’s\r\nnovels, Lockhart, vi. 406 (edition of 1839).]\r\n\r\n\r\nIt is style, as critics remind us, it is perfection of form, no doubt,\r\nthat secure the permanence of literature; but Scott did not overstate\r\nhis own defects when he wrote in his Journal (April 22, 1826): “A\r\nsolecism in point of composition, like a Scotch word, is indifferent to\r\nme. I never learned grammar. . . . I believe the bailiff in ‘The\r\nGoodnatured Man’ is not far wrong when he says: ‘One man has one way of\r\nexpressing himself, and another another; and that is all the difference\r\nbetween them.’” The difference between Scott and Thackeray or Flaubert\r\namong good writers, and a crowd of self-conscious and mannered\r\n“stylists” among writers not so very good, is essential. About\r\nShakspeare it was said that he “never blotted a line.” The observation\r\nis almost literally true about Sir Walter. The pages of his manuscript\r\nnovels show scarcely a retouch or an erasure, whether in the “Waverley”\r\nfragment of 1805 or the unpublished “Siege of Malta” of 1832.[*] The\r\nhandwriting becomes closer and smaller; from thirty-eight lines to the\r\npage in “Waverley,” he advances to between fifty and sixty in\r\n“Ivanhoe.” The few alterations are usually additions. For example, a\r\nfresh pedantry of the Baron of Bradwardine’s is occasionally set down\r\non the opposite page. Nothing can be less like the method of Flaubert\r\nor the method of Mr. Ruskin, who tells us that “a sentence of ‘Modern\r\nPainters’ was often written four or five times over in my own hand, and\r\ntried in every word for perhaps an hour,—perhaps a forenoon,—before it\r\nwas passed for the printer.” Each writer has his method; Scott was no\r\nstippler or niggler, but, as we shall see later, he often altered much\r\nin his proof-sheets.[**] As long as he was understood, he was almost\r\nreckless of well-constructed sentences, of the one best word for his\r\nmeaning, of rounded periods. This indifference is not to be praised,\r\nbut it is only a proof of his greatness that his style, never\r\ndistinguished, and often lax, has not impaired the vitality of his\r\nprose. The heart which beats in his works, the knowledge of human\r\nnature, the dramatic vigour of his character, the nobility of his whole\r\nbeing win the day against the looseness of his manner, the negligence\r\nof his composition, against the haste of fatigue which set him, as Lady\r\nLouisa Stuart often told him, on “huddling up a conclusion anyhow, and\r\nso kicking the book out of his way.” In this matter of _dénouements_ he\r\ncertainly was no more careful than Shakspeare or Molière.\r\n\r\n[* A history of Scott’s Manuscripts, with good fac-similes, will be\r\nfound in the Catalogue of the Scott Exhibition, Edinburgh, 1872.]\r\n\r\n\r\n[** While speaking of correction, it may be noted that Scott, in his\r\n“Advertisement” prefixed to the issue of 1829, speaks of changes made\r\nin that collected edition. In “Waverley” these emendations are very\r\nrare, and are unimportant. A few _callidæ juncturæ_ are added, a very\r\nfew lines are deleted. The postscript of the first edition did not\r\ncontain the anecdote about the hiding-place of the manuscript among the\r\nfishing tackle. The first line of Flora Macdonald’s battle-song\r\n(chapter xxii.) originally ran, “Mist darkens the mountain, night\r\ndarkens the vale,” in place of “There is mist on the mountain and mist\r\non the vale.” For the rest, as Scott says, “where the tree falls it\r\nmust lie.”]\r\n\r\n\r\nThe permanence of Sir Walter’s romances is proved, as we said, by their\r\nsurvival among all the changes of fashion in the art of fiction. When\r\nhe took up his pen to begin “Waverley,” fiction had not absorbed, as it\r\ndoes to-day, almost all the best imaginative energy of English or\r\nforeign writers. Now we hear of “art” on every side, and every novelist\r\nmust give the world his opinion about schools and methods. Scott, on\r\nthe other hand, lived in the greatest poetical age since that of\r\nElizabeth. Poetry or the drama (in which, to be sure, few succeeded)\r\noccupied Wordsworth, Byron, Coleridge, Shelley, Crabbe, Campbell, and\r\nKeats. Then, as Joanna Baillie hyperbolically declared, “The Scotch\r\nnovels put poetry out of fashion.”[*] Till they appeared, novels seem\r\nto have been left to readers like the plaintive lady’s-maid whom Scott\r\nmet at Dalkeith, when he beheld “the fair one descend from the carriage\r\nwith three half-bound volumes of a novel in her hand.” Mr. Morritt,\r\nwriting to Scott in March, 1815, hopes he will “restore pure narrative\r\nto the dignity from which it gradually slipped before it dwindled into\r\na manufactory for the circulating library.” “Waverley,” he asserted,\r\n“would prevail over people otherwise averse to blue-backed volumes.”\r\nThus it was an unconsidered art which Scott took up and revived. Half a\r\ncentury had passed since Fielding gave us in “Tom Jones” his own and\r\nvery different picture of life in the “’forty-five,”—of life with all\r\nthe romance of the “Race to Derby” cut down to a sentence or two. Since\r\nthe age of the great English novelists, Richardson and Fielding and\r\nMiss Burney, the art of fiction had been spasmodically alive in the\r\nhands of Mrs. Radcliffe, had been sentimental with Henry Mackenzie, and\r\nnow was all but moribund, save for the humorous Irish sketches of Miss\r\nEdgeworth. As Scott always insisted, it was mainly “the extended and\r\nwell-merited fame of Miss Edgeworth” which induced him to try his hand\r\non a novel containing pictures of Scottish life and character. Nothing\r\nwas more remarkable in his own novels than the blending of close and\r\nhumorous observation of common life with pleasure in adventurous\r\nnarratives about “what is not so, and was not so, and Heaven forbid\r\nthat it ever should be so,” as the girl says in the nursery tale.\r\nThrough his whole life he remained the dreamer of dreams and teller of\r\nwild legends, who had held the lads of the High School entranced round\r\nLuckie Brown’s fireside, and had fleeted the summer days in interchange\r\nof romances with a schoolboy friend, Mr. Irving, among the hills that\r\ngirdle Edinburgh. He ever had a passion for “knights and ladies and\r\ndragons and giants,” and “God only knows,” he says, “how delighted I\r\nwas to find myself in such society.” But with all this delight, his\r\nimagination had other pleasures than the fantastic: the humours and\r\npassions of ordinary existence were as clearly visible to him as the\r\nbattles, the castles, and the giants. True, he was more fastidious in\r\nhis choice of novels of real life than in his romantic reading. “The\r\nwhole Jemmy and Jessamy tribe I abhorred,” he said; “and it required\r\nthe art of Burney or the feeling of Mackenzie to fix my attention upon\r\na domestic tale.” But when the domestic tale was good and true, no man\r\nappreciated it more than he. None has more vigorously applauded Miss\r\nAusten than Scott, and it was thus that as the “Author of ‘Waverley’”\r\nhe addressed Miss Edgeworth, through James Ballantyne: “If I could but\r\nhit Miss Edgeworth’s wonderful power of vivifying all her persons, and\r\nmaking them live as _beings_ in your mind, I should not be afraid.”\r\n“Often,” Ballantyne goes on, “has the Author of ‘Waverley’ used such\r\nlanguage to me; and I knew that I gratified him most when I could say,\r\n‘Positively, this _is_ equal to Miss Edgeworth.’”\r\n\r\n[* Abbotsford Manuscripts. Hogg averred that nobody either read or\r\nwrote poetry after Sir Walter took to prose.]\r\n\r\n\r\nThus Scott’s own taste was catholic: and in this he was particularly\r\nunlike the modern novelists, who proclaim, from both sides of the\r\nAtlantic, that only in their own methods, and in sharing their own\r\nexclusive tastes, is literary salvation. The prince of Romance was no\r\none-sided _romanticiste;_ his ear was open to all fiction good in its\r\nkind. His generosity made him think Miss Edgeworth’s persons more alive\r\nthan his own. To his own romances he preferred Mrs. Shelley’s\r\n“Frankenstein.”[*] As a critic, of course, he was mistaken; but his was\r\nthe generous error of the heart, and it is the heart in Walter Scott,\r\neven more than the brain, that lends its own vitality to his creations.\r\nEquipped as he was with a taste truly catholic, capable in old age of\r\nadmiring “Pelham,” he had the power to do what he calls “the big\r\nbow-wow strain;” yet he was not, as in his modesty he supposed, denied\r\n“the exquisite touch which renders ordinary commonplace things and\r\ncharacters interesting, from the truth of the description and the\r\nsentiment.”[**]\r\n\r\n[* Scott reviewed “Frankenstein” in 1818. Mr. Shelley had sent it with\r\na brief note, in which he said that it was the work of a friend, and\r\nthat he had only seen it through the press. Sir Walter passed the book\r\non to Mr. Morritt, who, in reply, gave Scott a brief and not very\r\naccurate history of Shelley. Sir Walter then wrote a most favourable\r\nreview of “Frankenstein” in “Blackwood’s Magazine,” observing that it\r\nwas attributed to Mr. Percy Bysshe Shelley, a son-in-law of Mr. Godwin.\r\nMrs. Shelley presently wrote thanking him for the review, and assuring\r\nhim that it was her own work. Scott had apparently taken Shelley’s\r\ndisclaimer as an innocent evasion; it was an age of literary\r\nsuperscheries.—_Abbotsford Manuscripts_.]\r\n\r\n\r\n[** Journal, March 14, 1826.]\r\n\r\n\r\nThe letter of Rose Bradwardine to Waverley is alone enough to disprove\r\nScott’s disparagement of himself, his belief that he had been denied\r\nexquisiteness of touch. Nothing human is more delicate, nothing should\r\nbe more delicately handled, than the first love of a girl. What the\r\n“analytical” modern novelist would pass over and dissect and place\r\nbeneath his microscope till a student of any manliness blushes with\r\nshame and annoyance, Scott suffers Rose Bradwardine to reveal with a\r\nsensitive shyness. But Scott, of course, had even less in common with\r\nthe peeper and botanizer on maidens’ hearts than with the wildest\r\nromanticist. He considered that “a want of story is always fatal to a\r\nbook the first reading, and it is well if it gets a chance of a\r\nsecond.” From him “Pride and Prejudice” got a chance of three readings\r\nat least. This generous universality of taste, in addition to all his\r\nother qualities of humour and poetry, enabled Scott to raise the novel\r\nfrom its decadence, and to make the dry bones of history live again in\r\nhis tales. With Charles Edward at Holyrood, as Mr. Senior wrote in the\r\n“Quarterly Review,” “we are in the lofty region of romance. In any\r\nother hands than those of Sir Walter Scott, the language and conduct of\r\nthose great people would have been as dignified as their situations. We\r\nshould have heard nothing of the hero in his new costume ‘majoring\r\nafore the muckle pier-glass,’ of his arrest by the host of the\r\nCandlestick, of his examination by the well-powdered Major Melville, or\r\nof his fears of being informed against by Mrs. Nosebag.” In short,\r\n“while the leading persons and events are as remote from ordinary life\r\nas the inventions of Scudéry, the picture of human nature is as\r\nfaithful as could have been given by Fielding or Le Sage.” Though this\r\ncriticism has not the advantage of being new, it is true; and when we\r\nhave added that Scott’s novels are the novels of the poet who, next to\r\nShakspeare, knew mankind most widely and well, we have the secret of\r\nhis triumph.\r\n\r\nFor the first time in literature, it was a poet who held the pen of the\r\nromancer in prose. Fielding, Richardson, De Foe, Miss Burney, were none\r\nof them made by the gods poetical. Scott himself, with his habitual\r\ngenerosity, would have hailed his own predecessor in Mrs. Radcliffe.\r\n“The praise may be claimed for Mrs. Radcliffe of having been the first\r\nto introduce into her prose fictions a beautiful and fanciful tone of\r\nnatural description and impressive narrative, which had hitherto been\r\nexclusively applied to poetry. . . . Mrs. Radcliffe has a title to be\r\nconsidered the first poetess of romantic fiction.” When “Guy Mannering”\r\nappeared, Wordsworth sneered at it as a work of the Radcliffe school.\r\nThe slight difference produced by the introduction of humour could\r\nscarcely be visible to Wordsworth. But Scott would not have been hurt\r\nby his judgment. He had the literary courage to recognize merit even\r\nwhen obscured by extravagance, and to applaud that in which people of\r\nculture could find neither excellence nor charm. Like Thackeray, he had\r\nbeen thrilled by Vivaidi in the Inquisition, and he was not the man to\r\nhide his gratitude because his author was now out of fashion.\r\n\r\nThus we see that Scott, when he began “Waverley” in 1805, brought to\r\nhis labour no hard-and-fast theory of the art of fiction, but a kindly\r\nreadiness to be pleased, and to find good in everything. He brought his\r\nwide knowledge of contemporary Scottish life “from the peer to the\r\nploughman;” he brought his well-digested wealth of antiquarian lore,\r\nand the poetic skill which had just been busied with the “Lay of the\r\nLast Minstrel,” and was still to be occupied, ere he finished his\r\ninterrupted novel, with “Marmion,” “The Lady of the Lake,” “Rokeby,”\r\nand “The Lord of the Isles.” The comparative failure of the last-named\r\nno doubt strengthened his determination to try prose romance. He had\r\nnever cared much for his own poems, he says, Byron had outdone him in\r\npopularity, and the Muse—“the Good Demon” who once deserted\r\nHerrick—came now less eagerly to his call.\r\n\r\nIt is curiously difficult to disentangle the statements about the\r\ncomposition of “Waverley.” Our first authority, of course, is Scott’s\r\nown account, given in the General Preface to the Edition of 1829.\r\nLockhart, however, remarks on the haste with which Sir Walter wrote the\r\nIntroductions to the _magnum opus;_ and the lapse of fifteen years, the\r\neffects of disease, and his habitual carelessness about his own works\r\nand mode of working may certainly to some extent have clouded his\r\nmemory. “About the year 1805,” as he says, he “threw together about one\r\nthird part of the first volume of ‘Waverley.’” It was advertised to be\r\npublished, he goes on, by Ballantyne, with the second title, “’T is\r\nFifty Years since.” This, obviously, would have made 1755 the date of\r\nthe events, just as the title “’T is Sixty Years since” in 1814 brought\r\nthe date of the events to 1754. By inspecting the water-mark of the\r\npaper Lockhart discovered that 1805 was the period in which the first\r\nfew chapters were composed; the rest of the paper was marked 1814.\r\nScott next observes that the unfavourable opinion of a critical friend\r\non the first seven chapters induced him to lay the manuscript aside.\r\nWho was this friend? Lockhart thinks it was Erskine. It is certain,\r\nfrom a letter of Ballantyne’s at Abbotsford,—a letter printed by\r\nLockhart, September 15, 1810,—that Ballantyne in 1810 saw at least the\r\nearlier portions of “Waverley,” and it is clear enough that he had seen\r\nnone of it before. If any friend did read it in 1805, it cannot have\r\nbeen Ballantyne, and may have been Erskine. But none of the paper bears\r\na water-mark between 1805 and 1813, so Scott must merely have taken it\r\nup, in 1810, as it had been for five years. Now Scott says that the\r\nsuccess of “The Lady of the Lake,” with its Highland pictures, induced\r\nhim “to attempt something of the same sort in prose.” This, as Lockhart\r\nnotes, cannot refer to 1805, as the “Lady of the Lake” did not appear\r\ntill 1810. But the good fortune of the “Lady” may very well have\r\ninduced him in 1810 to reconsider his Highland prose romance. In 1808,\r\nas appears from an undated letter to Surtees of Mainsforth (Abbotsford\r\nManuscripts), he was contemplating a poem on “that wandering knight so\r\nfair,” Charles Edward, and on the adventures of his flight, on Lochiel,\r\nFlora Macdonald, the Kennedys, and the rest. Earlier still, on June 9,\r\n1806, Scott wrote to Lady Abercorn that he had “a great work in\r\ncontemplation, a Highland romance of love, magic, and war.” “The Lady\r\nof the Lake” took the place of that poem in his “century of\r\ninventions,” and, stimulated by the popularity of his Highland romance\r\nin verse, he disinterred the last seven chapters of “Waverley” from\r\ntheir five years of repose. Very probably, as he himself hints, the\r\nexercise of fitting a conclusion to Strutt’s “Queenhoo Hall” may have\r\nhelped to bring his fancy back to his own half-forgotten story of\r\n“Waverley.” In 1811 Scott went to Abbotsford, and there, as he tells\r\nus, he lost sight of his “Waverley” fragment.[*] Often looked for, it\r\nwas never found, till the accident of a search for fishing-tackle led\r\nhim to discover it in the drawer of an old bureau in a lumber-garret.\r\nThis cabinet afterwards came into the possession of Mr. William\r\nLaidlaw, Scott’s friend and amanuensis, and it is still, the Editor\r\nunderstands, in the hands of Miss Laidlaw. The fishing-tackle, Miss\r\nLaidlaw tells the Editor (mainly red hackles, tied on hair, not gut),\r\nstill occupies the drawer, except a few flies which were given, as\r\nrelics, to the late Mr. Thomas Tod Stoddart. In 1813, then, volume i.\r\nof “Waverley” was finished. Then Scott undertook some articles for\r\nConstable, and laid the novel aside. The printing, at last, must have\r\nbeen very speedy. Dining in Edinburgh, in June, 1814, Lockhart saw “the\r\nhand of Walter Scott” busy at its task. “Page after page is finished,\r\nand thrown on the heap of manuscripts, and still it goes on\r\nunwearied.”[**] The book was published on July 7, the press hardly\r\nkeeping up with the activity of the author. Scott had written “two\r\nvolumes in three summer weeks” and the printers had not shown less\r\nactivity, while binders and stitchers must have worked extra tides.\r\n\r\n[* Mr. R. P. Gillies says that in 1811 “Waverley, in three volumes, had\r\nbeen announced by John Ballantyne, and a sheet or two set in types”\r\n(Recollections of Sir Walter Scott, p 204).]\r\n\r\n\r\n[** Lockhart, iv, 172.]\r\n\r\n\r\n“Waverley” was published without the Author’s name. Scott’s reasons for\r\nbeing anonymous have been stated by himself. “It was his humour,”—that\r\nis the best of the reasons, and the secret gave him a great deal of\r\namusement. The Ballantynes, of course, knew it from the first; so did\r\nMr. Morritt, Lady Louisa Stuart, and Lord and Lady Montague, and others\r\nwere gradually admitted. In an undated letter, probably of November,\r\n1816, Scott says to the Marchioness of Abercorn, a most intimate\r\nfriend: “I cannot even conjecture whom you mean by Mr. Mackenzie as\r\nauthor of ‘The Antiquary.’ I should think my excellent old friend Mr.\r\nHarry Mackenzie [author of the ‘Man of Feeling,’ etc.] was too much\r\nadvanced in years and plunged in business to amuse himself by writing\r\nnovels; and besides, the style in no degree resembles his.” (Lady\r\nAbercorn meant “Young Harry Mackenzie,” not the patriarch.) “I am told\r\none of the English reviews gives these works by name and upon alleged\r\nauthority to George Forbes, Sir William’s brother; so they take them\r\noff my hands, I don’t care who they turn to, for I am really tired of\r\nan imputation which I am under the necessity of confuting at every\r\ncorner. Tom will soon be home from Canada, as the death of my elder\r\nbrother has left him a little money. He may answer for himself, but I\r\nhardly suspect him, unless much changed, to be possessed of the\r\nperseverance necessary to write nine volumes.” Scott elsewhere rather\r\nencouraged the notion that his brother Thomas was the author, and tried\r\nto make him exert himself and enter the field as a rival. Gossip also\r\nassigned the “Scotch novels” to Jeffrey, to Mrs. Thomas Scott, aided by\r\nher husband and Sir Walter, to a Dr. Greenfield, a clergyman, and to\r\nmany others. Sir Walter humorously suggested George Cranstoun as the\r\nreal offender. After the secret was publicly confessed, Lady Louisa\r\nStuart reminded Scott of all the amusement it had given them. “Old\r\nMortality” had been pronounced “too good” for Scott, and free from his\r\n“wearisome descriptions of scenery.” Clever people had detected several\r\nseparate hands in “Old Mortality,” as in the Iliad. All this was\r\ndiverting. Moreover, Scott was in some degree protected from the bores\r\nwho pester a successful author. He could deny the facts very stoutly,\r\nthough always, as he insists, with the reservation implied in alleging\r\nthat, if he had been the author, he would still have declined to\r\nconfess. In the notes to later novels we shall see some of his “great\r\ndenials.”\r\n\r\nThe reception of “Waverley” was enthusiastic. Large editions were sold\r\nin Edinburgh, and when Scott returned from his cruise in the northern\r\nislands he found society ringing with his unacknowledged triumph.\r\nByron, especially, proclaimed his pleasure in “Waverley.” It may be\r\ncurious to recall some of the published reviews of the moment. Probably\r\nno author ever lived so indifferent to published criticism as Scott.\r\nMiss Edgeworth, in one of her letters, reminds him how they had both\r\nagreed that writers who cared for the dignity and serenity of their\r\ncharacters should abstain from “that authors’ bane-stuff.” “As to the\r\nherd of critics,” Scott wrote to Miss Seward, after publishing “The\r\nLay,” “many of those gentlemen appear to me to be a set of tinkers,\r\nwho, unable to _make_ pots and pans, set up for _menders_ of them.” It\r\nis probable, therefore, that he was quite unconcerned about the few\r\nremarks which Mr. Gifford, in the “Quarterly Review” (vol. xl., 1814),\r\ninterspersed among a multitude of extracts, in a notice of “Waverley”\r\nmanufactured with scissors and paste. The “Quarterly” recognized “a\r\nScotch Castle Rackrent,” but in “a much higher strain.” The tale was\r\nadmitted to possess all the accuracy of history, and all the vivacity\r\nof romance. Scott’s second novel, “Guy Mannering,” was attacked with\r\nsome viciousness in the periodical of which he was practically the\r\nfounder, and already the critic was anxious to repeat what Scott,\r\ntalking of Pope’s censors, calls “the cuckoo cry of ‘written out’!” The\r\nnotice of “Waverley” in the “Edinburgh Review” by Mr. Jeffrey was not\r\nso slight and so unworthy of the topic. The novel was declared, and not\r\nunjustly, to be “very hastily, and in many places very unskilfully,\r\nwritten.” The Scotch was decried as “unintelligible” dialect by the\r\nvery reviewer who had accused “Marmion” of not being Scotch enough. But\r\nthe “Edinburgh” applauded “the extraordinary fidelity and felicity”\r\nwith which all the inferior agents in the story are represented.\r\n“Fastidious readers” might find Callum Beg and Mrs. Nosebag and the\r\nCumberland peasants “coarse and disgusting,” said the reviewer, who\r\nmust have had in his imagination readers extremely superfine. He\r\nobjected to the earlier chapters as uninteresting, and—with justice—to\r\nthe passages where the author speaks in “the smart and flippant style\r\nof modern makers of paragraphs.” “These form a strange and humiliating\r\ncontrast with the force and freedom of his manner when engaged in those\r\ndramatic and picturesque representations to which his genius so\r\ndecidedly inclines.” He spoke severely of the places where Scott\r\nexplains the circumstances of Waverley’s adventures before he reaches\r\nEdinburgh; and Scott himself, in his essay on Mrs. Radcliffe, regrets\r\nthat explanatory chapters had ever been invented. The reviewer broadly\r\nhints his belief that Scott is the author; and on the whole, except for\r\na cautious lack of enthusiasm, the notice is fair and kindly. The\r\n“Monthly Review” differed not much from the Blue and Yellow (the\r\n“Edinburgh Review”).\r\n\r\n“It is not one of the least merits of this very uncommon production\r\nthat all the subordinate characters are touched with the same\r\ndiscriminating force which so strongly marks their principals; and that\r\nin this manner almost every variety of station and interest, such as\r\nexisted at the period under review, is successively brought before the\r\nmind of the reader in colours vivid as the original.\r\n    “A few oversights, we think, we have detected in the conduct of the\r\n    story which ought not to remain unnoticed. For example, the age of\r\n    Stanley and Lady Emily does not seem well to accord with the\r\n    circumstances of their union, as related in the commencement of the\r\n    work; and we are not quite satisfied that Edward should have been\r\n    so easily reconciled to the barbarous and stubborn prejudices which\r\n    precluded even the office of intercession for his gallant friend\r\n    and companion-in-arms.\r\n    “The pieces of poetry which are not very profusely scattered\r\n    through these volumes can scarcely fail to be ascribed to Mr.\r\n    Scott, whatever may be judged of the body of the work. In point of\r\n    comparative merit, we should class them neither with the highest\r\n    nor with the meanest effusions of his lyric minstrelsy.”\r\n\r\n\r\nLord Byron’s “Grandmother’s Review, the British,” was also friendly and\r\nsagacious, in its elderly way.\r\n\r\n“We request permission, therefore, to introduce ‘Waverley,’ a\r\npublication which has already excited considerable interest in the\r\nsister kingdom, to the literary world on this side the Tweed.\r\n    “A very short time has elapsed since this publication made its\r\n    appearance in Edinburgh, and though it came into the world in the\r\n    modest garb of anonymous obscurity, the Northern _literati_ are\r\n    unanimous, we understand, in ascribing part of it, at least, to the\r\n    pen of W. Scott.\r\n    “We are unwilling to consider this publication in the light of a\r\n    common novel whose fate it is to be devoured with rapidity for a\r\n    day, and afterwards forgotten forever, but as a vehicle of curious\r\n    and accurate information upon a subject which must at all times\r\n    demand our attention,—the history and manners of a very large and\r\n    renowned portion of the inhabitants of these islands. We would\r\n    recommend this tale as faithfully embodying the lives, the manners,\r\n    and the opinions of this departed race, and as affording those\r\n    features of ancient days which no man probably, besides its author,\r\n    has had the means to collect, the desire to preserve, or the power\r\n    to portray.\r\n    “Although there are characters sufficient to awaken the attention\r\n    and to diversify the scenes, yet they are not in sufficient number\r\n    to perplex the memory or to confuse the incidents. Their spirit is\r\n    well kept up till the very last, and they relieve one another with\r\n    so much art that the reader will not find himself wearied even with\r\n    the pedantic jargon of the old Baron of Bradwardine.\r\n    “Of Waverley himself we shall say but little, as his character is\r\n    far too common to need a comment; we can only say that his\r\n    wanderings are not gratuitous, nor is he wavering and indecisive\r\n    only because the author chooses to make him so. Every feature in\r\n    his character is formed by education, and it is to this first\r\n    source that we are constantly referred for a just and sufficient\r\n    cause of all the wandering passions as they arise in his mind.\r\n    “The secondary personages are drawn with much spirit and fidelity,\r\n    and with a very striking knowledge of the peculiarities of the\r\n    Scotch temper and disposition. The incidents are all founded on\r\n    fact, and the historical parts are related with much accuracy. The\r\n    livelier scenes which are displayed are of the most amusing\r\n    species, because they flow so naturally from the personages before\r\n    us that the characters, not the author, appear to speak. A strong\r\n    vein of very original humour marks the whole: in most instances it\r\n    is indeed of a local and particular nature, but in many cases it\r\n    assumes a more general appearance.\r\n    “Of the more serious portions we can speak with unqualified\r\n    approbation; the very few pathetic scenes which occur are short,\r\n    dignifed, and affecting. The love-scenes are sufficiently\r\n    contracted to produce that very uncommon sensation in the mind,—a\r\n    wish that they were longer.\r\n    “The religious opinions expressed in the course of the tale are\r\n    few, but of those few we fully approve.\r\n    “The humorous and happy adaptation of legal terms shows no moderate\r\n    acquaintance with the arcana of the law, and a perpetual allusion\r\n    to the English and Latin classics no common share of scholarship\r\n    and taste.”\r\n\r\n\r\nThe “Scots Magazine” illustrated the admirable unanimity of reviewers\r\nwhen they _are_ unanimous. The “Anti-jacobin” objected that no\r\nChâteau-Margaux sent in the wood from Bordeaux to Dundee in 1713 could\r\nhave been drinkable in 1745. “Claret two-and-thirty years old! It\r\nalmost gives us the gripes to think of it.” Indeed, Sir Walter, as\r\nLochhart assures us, was so far from being a judge of claret that he\r\ncould not tell when it was “corked.” One or two points equally\r\nimportant amused the reviewer, who, like most of his class, detected\r\nthe hand of Scott. There was hardly a possibility, as Mr. Morritt told\r\nSir Walter, “that the poems in ‘Waverley’ could fail to suggest their\r\nauthor. No man who ever heard you tell a story over a table but must\r\nrecognize you at once.” To his praise of “Waverley” Mr. Morritt hardly\r\nadded any adverse criticism, beyond doubting the merit of the early\r\nchapters, and denouncing the word “sombre” as one which had lately\r\n“kept bad company among the slipshod English of the sentimental\r\nschool.” Scott, in defence, informed Mr. Morritt that he had “left the\r\nstory to flag in the first volume on purpose. . . . I wished (with what\r\nsuccess Heaven knows) to avoid the ordinary error of novelists, whose\r\nfirst volume is usually their best.”\r\n\r\nIt must be admitted that if Scott wished to make “Waverley” “flag” in\r\nthe beginning, he succeeded extremely well,—too well for many modern\r\nreaders, accustomed to a leap into the midst of the story. “These\r\nintroductory chapters,” he observes in a note on the fifth of them,\r\n“have been a good deal censured as tedious and unnecessary; yet there\r\nare circumstances recorded in them which the Author has not been able\r\nto persuade himself to retract or cancel.” These “circumstances” are\r\nprobably the studies of Waverley, his romantic readings, which are\r\nreally autobiographic. Scott was, apparently, seriously of opinion that\r\nthe “mental discipline” of a proper classical education would have been\r\nbetter for himself than his own delightfully desultory studies.\r\nBallantyne could not see what Waverley’s reading had to do with his\r\nadventures and character. Scott persisted in being of another mind. He\r\nhimself, writing to Morritt, calls his hero “a sneaking piece of\r\nimbecility;” but he probably started with loftier intentions of\r\n“psychological analysis” than he fulfilled. He knew, and often said, in\r\nprivate letters, as in published works, that he was no hand at a\r\nrespectable hero. Borderers, buccaneers, robbers, and humorsome people,\r\nlike Dugald Dalgetty and Bailie Nicol Jarvie and Macwheeble, whom he\r\nsaid he preferred to any person in “Waverley,” were the characters he\r\ndelighted in. We may readily believe that Shakspeare too preferred\r\nJacques and the Fat Knight to Orlando or the favoured lover of Anne\r\nPage. Your hero is a difficult person to make human,—unless, indeed, he\r\nhas the defects of Pendennis or Tom Jones. But it is likely enough that\r\nthe Waverley whom Scott had in his mind in 1805 was hardly the Waverley\r\nof 1813. His early English chapters are much in the ordinary vein of\r\nnovels as they were then written; in those chapters come the “asides”\r\nby the author which the “Edinburgh Review” condemned. But there remains\r\nthe kindly, honourable Sir Everard, while the calm atmosphere of\r\nEnglish meadows, and the plump charms of Miss Cecilia Stubbs, are\r\nintended as foils to the hills of the North, the shy refinement of\r\nRose, and the heroic heart of Flora Mac-Ivor. Scott wished to show the\r\nremote extremes of civilization and mental habit co-existing in the\r\nsame island of Scotland and England. Yet we regret such passages as\r\n“craving pardon for my heroics, which I am unable in certain cases to\r\nresist giving way to,” and so forth. Scott was no Thackeray, no\r\nFielding, and failed (chiefly in “Waverley”) when he attempted the mood\r\nof banter, which one of his daughters, a lady “of Beatrice’s mind,”\r\n“never got from me,” he observes.\r\n\r\nIn any serious attempt to criticise “Waverley” as a whole, it is not\r\neasy to say whether we should try to put ourselves at the point of view\r\nof its first readers, or whether we should look at it from the\r\nvantage-ground of to-day. In 1814 the dead world of clannish loyalty\r\nwas fresh in many memories. Scott’s own mother had often spoken with a\r\nperson who had seen Cromwell enter Edinburgh after Dunbar. He himself\r\nknew heroes of the Forty-five, and his friend Lady Louisa Stuart had\r\nbeen well acquainted with Miss Walkinshaw, sister of the mistress of\r\nCharles Edward. To his generation those things were personal memories,\r\nwhich to us seem as distant as the reign of Men-ka-ra. They could not\r\nbut be “carried off their feet” by such pictures of a past still so\r\nnear them. Nor had they other great novelists to weaken the force of\r\nScott’s impressions. They had not to compare him with the melancholy\r\nmirth of Thackeray, and the charm, the magic, of his style. Balzac was\r\nof the future; of the future was the Scott of France,—the boyish, the\r\nwitty, the rapid, the brilliant, the inexhaustible Dumas. Scott’s\r\ngeneration had no scruples about “realism,” listened to no sermons on\r\nthe glory of the commonplace; like Dr. Johnson, they admired a book\r\nwhich “was amusing as a fairy-tale.” But we are overwhelmed with a\r\nwealth of comparisons, and deafened by a multitude of homilies on\r\nfiction, and distracted, like the people in the _Eyrbyggja_ Saga, by\r\nthe strange rising and setting, and the wild orbits of new “weirdmoons”\r\nof romance. Before we can make up our minds on Scott, we have to\r\nremember, or forget, the scornful patronage of one critic, the\r\nover-subtlety and exaggerations of another, the more than papal\r\ninfallibility of a third. Perhaps the best critic would be an\r\nintelligent school-boy, with a generous heart and an unspoiled\r\nimagination. As his remarks are not accessible, as we must try to judge\r\n“Waverley” like readers inured to much fiction and much criticism, we\r\nmust confess, no doubt, that the commencement has the faults which the\r\nfirst reviewers detected, and which Scott acknowledged. He is decidedly\r\nslow in getting to business, as they say; he began with more of\r\nconscious ethical purpose than he went on, and his banter is poor. But\r\nwhen once we enter the village of Tully-Veolan, the Magician finds his\r\nwand. Each picture of place or person tells,—the old butler, the daft\r\nDavie Gellatley, the solemn and chivalrous Baron, the pretty natural\r\ngirl, the various lairds, the factor Macwheeble,—all at once become\r\nliving people, and friends whom we can never lose. The creative fire of\r\nShakspeare lives again. The Highlanders—Evan Dhu, Donald Bean Lean, his\r\ncharming daughter, Callum Beg, and all the rest—are as natural as the\r\nLowlanders. In Fergus and Flora we feel, indeed, at first, that the\r\nauthor has left his experience behind, and is giving us creatures of\r\nfancy. But they too become human and natural,—Fergus in his moods of\r\nanger, ambition, and final courageous resignation; Flora, in her grief.\r\nAs for Waverley, his creator was no doubt too hard on him. Among the\r\nbrave we hear that he was one of the bravest, though Scott always wrote\r\nhis battlepieces in a manner to suggest no discomfort, and does not\r\ngive us particular details of Waverley’s prowess. He has spirit enough,\r\nthis “sneaking piece of imbecility,” as he shows in his quarrel with\r\nFergus, on the march to Derby. Waverley, that creature of romance,\r\nconsidered as a lover, is really not romantic enough. He loved Rose\r\nbecause she loved him,—which is confessed to be unheroic behaviour.\r\nScott, in “Waverley,” certainly does not linger over love-scenes. With\r\nMr. Ruskin, we may say: “Let it not be thought for an instant that the\r\nslight and sometimes scornful glance with which Scott passes over\r\nscenes, which a novelist of our own day would have analyzed with the\r\nairs of a philosopher, and painted with the curiosity of a gossip,\r\nindicates any absence in his heart of sympathy with the great and\r\nsacred elements of personal happiness.” But his mind entertained other\r\nthemes of interest, “loyalty, patriotism, piety.” On the other hand, it\r\nis necessary to differ from Mr. Ruskin when he says that Scott “never\r\nknew ‘l’amor che move ’l sol e l’altre stelle.’” He whose heart was\r\n“broken for two years,” and retained the crack till his dying day, he\r\nwho, when old and tired, and near his death, was yet moved by the\r\nmemory of the name which thirty years before he had cut in Runic\r\ncharacters on the turf at the Castle-gate of St. Andrew, knew love too\r\nwell to write of it much, or to speak of it at all. He had won his\r\nideal as alone the ideal can be won; he never lost her: she was with\r\nhim always, because she had been unattainable. “There are few,” he\r\nsays, “who have not, at one period of life, broken ties of love and\r\nfriendship, secret disappointments of the heart, to mourn over,—and we\r\nknow no book which recalls the memory of them more severely than ‘Julia\r\nde Roubigné.’” He could not be very eager to recall them, he who had so\r\nbitterly endured them, and because he had known and always knew “l’amor\r\nche move ’l sol e l’altre stelle,” a seal was on his lips, a silence\r\nbroken only by a caress of Di Vernon’s.[*]\r\n\r\n[* In a letter to Lady Abercorn, written when he was busy with the\r\n“Lady of the Lake,” Scott complained that he could not draw a lover, in\r\nspite of his own experience.]\r\n\r\n\r\nThis apology we may make, if an apology be needed, for what modern\r\nreaders may think the meagreness of the love-passages in Scott. He does\r\nnot deal in embraces and effusions, his taste is too manly; he does not\r\ndwell much on Love, because, like the shepherd in Theocritus, he has\r\nfound him an inhabitant of the rocks. Moreover, when Scott began\r\nnovel-writing, he was as old as Thackeray when Thackeray said that\r\nwhile at work on a love-scene he blushed so that you would think he was\r\ngoing into an apoplexy. “Waverley” stands by its pictures of manners,\r\nof character, by its humour and its tenderness, by its manly “criticism\r\nof life,” by its touches of poetry, so various, so inspired, as in\r\nDavie Gellatley with his songs, and Charles Edward in the gallant hour\r\nof Holyrood, and Flora with her high, selfless hopes and broken heart,\r\nand the beloved Baron, bearing his lot “with a good-humoured though\r\nserious composure.” “To be sure, we may say with Virgilius Maro,\r\n‘Fuimus Troes’—and there’s the end of an auld sang. But houses and\r\nfamilies and men have a’ stood lang eneugh when they have stood till\r\nthey fall with honour.”\r\n\r\n“Waverley” ends like a fairy-tale, while real life ever ends like a\r\nNorthern saga. But among the good things that make life bearable, such\r\nfairy-tales are not the least precious, and not the least enduring.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nINTRODUCTION\r\n\r\n\r\nThe plan of this edition leads me to insert in this place some account\r\nof the incidents on which the Novel of Waverley is founded. They have\r\nbeen already given to the public by my late lamented friend, William\r\nErskine, Esq. (afterwards Lord Kinneder), when reviewing the Tales of\r\nMy Landlord for the Quarterly Review in 1817. The particulars were\r\nderived by the critic from the Author’s information. Afterwards they\r\nwere published in the preface to the “Chronicles of the Canongate”.\r\nThey are now inserted in their proper place.\r\n\r\nThe mutual protection afforded by Waverley and Talbot to each other,\r\nupon which the whole plot depends, is founded upon one of those\r\nanecdotes which soften the features even of civil war; and, as it is\r\nequally honourable to the memory of both parties, we have no hesitation\r\nto give their names at length. When the Highlanders, on the morning of\r\nthe battle of Preston, 1745, made their memorable attack on Sir John\r\nCope’s army, a battery of four field-pieces was stormed and carried by\r\nthe Camerons and the Stewarts of Appine. The late Alexander Stewart of\r\nInvernahylewas one of the foremost in the charge, and observing an\r\nofficer of the King’s forces, who, scorning to join the flight of all\r\naround, remained with his sword in his hand, as if determined to the\r\nvery last to defend the post assigned to him, the Highland gentleman\r\ncommanded him to surrender, and received for reply a thrust, which he\r\ncaught in his target. The officer was now defenceless, and the\r\nbattle-axe of a gigantic Highlander (the miller of Invernahyle’s mill)\r\nwas uplifted to dash his brains out, when Mr. Stewart with difficulty\r\nprevailed on him to yield. He took charge of his enemy’s property,\r\nprotected his person, and finally obtained him liberty on his parole.\r\nThe officer proved to be Colonel Whitefoord, an Ayrshire gentleman of\r\nhigh character and influence, and warmly attached to the House of\r\nHanover; yet such was the confidence existing between these two\r\nhonourable men, though of different political principles, that, while\r\nthe civil war was raging, and straggling officers from the Highland\r\narmy were executed without mercy, Invernahyle hesitated not to pay his\r\nlate captive a visit, as he returned to the Highlands to raise fresh\r\nrecruits, on which occasion he spent a day or two in Ayrshire among\r\nColonel Whitefoord’s Whig friends, as pleasantly and as good-humouredly\r\nas if all had been at peace around him.\r\n\r\nAfter the battle of Culloden had ruined the hopes of Charles Edward and\r\ndispersed his proscribed adherents, it was Colonel Whitefoord’s turn to\r\nstrain every nerve to obtain Mr. Stewart’s pardon. He went to the Lord\r\nJustice Clerk to the Lord Advocate, and to all the officers of state,\r\nand each application was answered by the production of a list in which\r\nInvernahyle (as the good old gentleman was wont to express it) appeared\r\n“marked with the sign of the beast!” as a subject unfit for favour or\r\npardon.\r\n\r\nAt length Colonel Whitefoord applied to the Duke of Cumberland in\r\nperson. From him, also, he received a positive refusal. He then limited\r\nhis request, for the present, to a protection for Stewart’s house,\r\nwife, children, and property. This was also refused by the Duke; on\r\nwhich Colonel Whitefoord, taking his commission from his bosom, laid it\r\non the table before his Royal Highness with much emotion, and asked\r\npermission to retire from the service of a sovereign who did not know\r\nhow to spare a vanquished enemy. The Duke was struck, and even\r\naffected. He bade the Colonel take up his commission, and granted the\r\nprotection he required. It was issued just in time to save the house,\r\ncorn, and cattle at Invernahyle from the troops, who were engaged in\r\nlaying waste what it was the fashion to call “the country of the\r\nenemy.” A small encampment of soldiers was formed on Invernahyle’s\r\nproperty, which they spared while plundering the country around, and\r\nsearching in every direction for the leaders of the insurrection, and\r\nfor Stewart in particular. He was much nearer them than they suspected;\r\nfor, hidden in a cave (like the Baron of Bradwardine), he lay for many\r\ndays so near the English sentinels that he could hear their muster-roll\r\ncalled. His food was brought to him by one of his daughters, a child of\r\neight years old, whom Mrs. Stewart was under the necessity of\r\nentrusting with this commission; for her own motions, and those of all\r\nher elder inmates, were closely watched. With ingenuity beyond her\r\nyears, the child used to stray about among the soldiers, who were\r\nrather kind to her, and thus seize the moment when she was unobserved\r\nand steal into the thicket, when she deposited whatever small store of\r\nprovisions she had in charge at some marked spot, where her father\r\nmight find it. Invernahyle supported life for several weeks by means of\r\nthese precarious supplies; and, as he had been wounded in the battle of\r\nCulloden, the hardships which he endured were aggravated by great\r\nbodily pain. After the soldiers had removed their quarters he had\r\nanother remarkable escape.\r\n\r\nAs he now ventured to his own house at night and left it in the\r\nmorning, he was espied during the dawn by a party of the enemy, who\r\nfired at and pursued him. The fugitive being fortunate enough to escape\r\ntheir search, they returned to the house and charged the family with\r\nharbouring one of the proscribed traitors. An old woman had presence of\r\nmind enough to maintain that the man they had seen was the shepherd.\r\n“Why did he not stop when we called to him?” said the soldier. “He is\r\nas deaf, poor man, as a peat-stack,” answered the ready-witted\r\ndomestic. “Let him be sent for directly.” The real shepherd accordingly\r\nwas brought from the hill, and, as there was time to tutor him by the\r\nway, he was as deaf when he made his appearance as was necessary to\r\nsustain his character. Invernahyle was afterwards pardoned under the\r\nAct of Indemnity.\r\n\r\nThe Author knew him well, and has often heard these circumstances from\r\nhis own mouth. He was a noble specimen of the old Highlander, far\r\ndescended, gallant, courteous, and brave, even to chivalry. He had been\r\n_out_, I believe, in 1715 and 1745, was an active partaker in all the\r\nstirring scenes which passed in the Highlands betwixt these memorable\r\neras; and, I have heard, was remarkable, among other exploits, for\r\nhaving fought a duel with the broadsword with the celebrated Rob Roy\r\nMacGregor at the clachan of Balquidder.\r\n\r\nInvernahyle chanced to be in Edinburgh when Paul Jones came into the\r\nFirth of Forth, and though then an old man, I saw him in arms, and\r\nheard him exult (to use his own words) in the prospect of “drawing his\r\nclaymore once more before he died.” In fact, on that memorable\r\noccasion, when the capital of Scotland was menaced by three trifling\r\nsloops or brigs, scarce fit to have sacked a fishing village, he was\r\nthe only man who seemed to propose a plan of resistance. He offered to\r\nthe magistrates, if broadswords and dirks could be obtained, to find as\r\nmany Highlanders among the lower classes as would cut off any boat’s\r\ncrew who might be sent into a town full of narrow and winding passages,\r\nin which they were like to disperse in quest of plunder. I know not if\r\nhis plan was attended to, I rather think it seemed too hazardous to the\r\nconstituted authorities, who might not, even at that time, desire to\r\nsee arms in Highland hands. A steady and powerful west wind settled the\r\nmatter by sweeping Paul Jones and his vessels out of the Firth.\r\n\r\nIf there is something degrading in this recollection, it is not\r\nunpleasant to compare it with those of the last war, when Edinburgh,\r\nbesides regular forces and militia, furnished a volunteer brigade of\r\ncavalry, infantry, and artillery to the amount of six thousand men and\r\nupwards, which was in readiness to meet and repel a force of a far more\r\nformidable description than was commanded by the adventurous American.\r\nTime and circumstances change the character of nations and the fate of\r\ncities; and it is some pride to a Scotchman to reflect that the\r\nindependent and manly character of a country, willing to entrust its\r\nown protection to the arms of its children, after having been obscured\r\nfor half a century, has, during the course of his own lifetime,\r\nrecovered its lustre.\r\n\r\nOther illustrations of “Waverley” will be found in the Notes at the\r\nfoot of the pages to which they belong. Those which appeared too long\r\nto be so placed are given at the end of the chapters to which they\r\nseverally relate. [Footnote: In this edition at the end of the several\r\nvolumes.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPREFACE TO THE THIRD EDITION\r\n\r\n\r\nTo this slight attempt at a sketch of ancient Scottish manners the\r\npublic have been more favourable than the Author durst have hoped or\r\nexpected. He has heard, with a mixture of satisfaction and humility,\r\nhis work ascribed to more than one respectable name. Considerations,\r\nwhich seem weighty in his particular situation, prevent his releasing\r\nthose gentlemen from suspicion by placing his own name in the\r\ntitle-page; so that, for the present at least, it must remain uncertain\r\nwhether WAVERLEY be the work of a poet or a critic, a lawyer or a\r\nclergyman, or whether the writer, to use Mrs. Malaprop’s phrase, be,\r\n“like Cerberus, three gentlemen at once.”\r\n\r\nThe Author, as he is unconscious of anything in the work itself (except\r\nperhaps its frivolity) which prevents its finding an acknowledged\r\nfather, leaves it to the candour of the public to choose among the many\r\ncircumstances peculiar to different situations in life such as may\r\ninduce him to suppress his name on the present occasion. He may be a\r\nwriter new to publication, and unwilling to avow a character to which\r\nhe is unaccustomed; or he may be a hackneyed author, who is ashamed of\r\ntoo frequent appearance, and employs this mystery, as the heroine of\r\nthe old comedy used her mask, to attract the attention of those to whom\r\nher face had become too familiar. He may be a man of a grave\r\nprofession, to whom the reputation of being a novel-writer might be\r\nprejudicial; or he may be a man of fashion, to whom writing of any kind\r\nmight appear pedantic. He may be too young to assume the character of\r\nan author, or so old as to make it advisable to lay it aside.\r\n\r\nThe Author of “Waverley” has heard it objected to this novel, that, in\r\nthe character of Callum Beg and in the account given by the Baron of\r\nBradwardine of the petty trespasses of the Highlanders upon trifling\r\narticles of property, he has borne hard, and unjustly so, upon their\r\nnational character. Nothing could be farther from his wish or\r\nintention. The character of Callum Beg is that of a spirit naturally\r\nturned to daring evil, and determined, by the circumstances of his\r\nsituation, to a particular species of mischief. Those who have perused\r\nthe curious Letters from the Highlands, published about 1726, will find\r\ninstances of such atrocious characters which fell under the writer’s\r\nown observation, though it would be most unjust to consider such\r\nvillains as representatives of the Highlanders of that period, any more\r\nthan the murderers of Marr and Williamson can be supposed to represent\r\nthe English of the present day. As for the plunder supposed to have\r\nbeen picked up by some of the insurgents in 1745, it must be remembered\r\nthat, although the way of that unfortunate little army was neither\r\nmarked by devastation nor bloodshed, but, on the contrary, was orderly\r\nand quiet in a most wonderful degree, yet no army marches through a\r\ncountry in a hostile manner without committing some depredations; and\r\nseveral, to the extent and of the nature jocularly imputed to them by\r\nthe Baron, were really laid to the charge of the Highland insurgents;\r\nfor which many traditions, and particularly one respecting the Knight\r\nof the Mirror, may be quoted as good evidence.[*]\r\n\r\n[* A homely metrical narrative of the events of the period, which\r\ncontains some striking particulars, and is still a great favourite with\r\nthe lower classes, gives a very correct statement of the behaviour of\r\nthe mountaineers respecting this same military license; and, as the\r\nverses are little known, and contain some good sense, we venture to\r\ninsert them.]\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE AUTHOR’S ADDRESS TO ALL IN GENERAL\r\n\r\n\r\nNow, gentle readers, I have let you ken\r\nMy very thoughts, from heart and pen,\r\n’Tis needless for to conten’\r\n          Or yet controule,\r\nFor there’s not a word o’t I can men’;\r\n          So ye must thole.\r\n\r\nFor on both sides some were not good;\r\nI saw them murd’ring in cold blood,\r\nNot the gentlemen, but wild and rude,\r\n          The baser sort,\r\nWho to the wounded had no mood\r\n          But murd’ring sport!\r\n\r\nEv’n both at Preston and Falkirk,\r\nThat fatal night ere it grew mirk,\r\nPiercing the wounded with their durk,\r\n          Caused many cry!\r\nSuch pity’s shown from Savage and Turk\r\n          As peace to die.\r\n\r\nA woe be to such hot zeal,\r\nTo smite the wounded on the fiell!\r\nIt’s just they got such groats in kail,\r\n          Who do the same.\r\nIt only teaches crueltys real\r\n          To them again.\r\n\r\nI’ve seen the men call’d Highland rogues,\r\nWith Lowland men make shangs a brogs,\r\nSup kail and brose, and fling the cogs\r\n          Out at the door,\r\nTake cocks, hens, sheep, and hogs,\r\n          And pay nought for.\r\n\r\nI saw a Highlander, ’t was right drole,\r\nWith a string of puddings hung on a pole,\r\nWhip’d o’er his shoulder, skipped like a fole,\r\n          Caus’d Maggy bann,\r\nLap o’er the midden and midden-hole,\r\n          And aff he ran.\r\n\r\nWhen check’d for this, they’d often tell ye,\r\nIndeed _her nainsell’s_ a tume belly;\r\nYou’ll no gie’t wanting bought, nor sell me;\r\n          _Hersell_ will hae’t;\r\nGo tell King Shorge, and Shordy’s Willie,\r\n          I’ll hae a meat.\r\n\r\nI saw the soldiers at Linton-brig,\r\nBecause the man was not a Whig,\r\nOf meat and drink leave not a skig,\r\n          Within his door;\r\nThey burnt his very hat and wig,\r\n          And thump’d him sore.\r\n\r\nAnd through the Highlands they were so rude,\r\nAs leave them neither clothes nor food,\r\nThen burnt their houses to conclude;\r\n          ’T was tit for tat.\r\nHow can _her nainsell_ e’er be good,\r\n          To think on that?\r\n\r\nAnd after all, O, shame and grief!\r\nTo use some worse than murd’ring thief,\r\nTheir very gentleman and chief,\r\n          Unhumanly!\r\nLike Popish tortures, I believe,\r\n          Such cruelty.\r\n\r\nEv’n what was act on open stage\r\nAt Carlisle, in the hottest rage,\r\nWhen mercy was clapt in a cage,\r\n          And pity dead,\r\nSuch cruelty approv’d by every age,\r\n          I shook my head.\r\n\r\nSo many to curse, so few to pray,\r\nAnd some aloud huzza did cry;\r\nThey cursed the rebel Scots that day,\r\n          As they’d been nowt\r\nBrought up for slaughter, as that way\r\n          Too many rowt.\r\n\r\nTherefore, alas! dear countrymen,\r\nO never do the like again,\r\nTo thirst for vengeance, never ben’\r\n          Your gun nor pa’,\r\nBut with the English e’en borrow and len’,\r\n          Let anger fa’.\r\n\r\nTheir boasts and bullying, not worth a louse,\r\nAs our King’s the best about the house.\r\n’T is ay good to be sober and douce,\r\n          To live in peace;\r\nFor many, I see, for being o’er crouse,\r\n          Gets broken face.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWAVERLEY\r\n\r\nOR\r\n\r\n’TIS SIXTY YEARS SINCE\r\n\r\nVolume I.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER I.\r\nINTRODUCTORY\r\n\r\n\r\nThe title of this work has not been chosen without the grave and solid\r\ndeliberation which matters of importance demand from the prudent. Even\r\nits first, or general denomination, was the result of no common\r\nresearch or selection, although, according to the example of my\r\npredecessors, I had only to seize upon the most sounding and euphonic\r\nsurname that English history or topography affords, and elect it at\r\nonce as the title of my work and the name of my hero. But, alas! what\r\ncould my readers have expected from the chivalrous epithets of Howard,\r\nMordaunt, Mortimer, or Stanley, or from the softer and more sentimental\r\nsounds of Belmour, Belville, Belfield, and Belgrave, but pages of\r\ninanity, similar to those which have been so christened for half a\r\ncentury past? I must modestly admit I am too diffident of my own merit\r\nto place it in unnecessary opposition to preconceived associations; I\r\nhave, therefore, like a maiden knight with his white shield, assumed\r\nfor my hero, WAVERLEY, an uncontaminated name, bearing with its sound\r\nlittle of good or evil, excepting what the reader shall hereafter be\r\npleased to affix to it. But my second or supplemental title was a\r\nmatter of much more difficult election, since that, short as it is, may\r\nbe held as pledging the author to some special mode of laying his\r\nscene, drawing his characters, and managing his adventures. Had I, for\r\nexample, announced in my frontispiece, “Waverley, a Tale of other\r\nDays,” must not every novel-reader have anticipated a castle scarce\r\nless than that of Udolpho, of which the eastern wing had long been\r\nuninhabited, and the keys either lost, or consigned to the care of some\r\naged butler or housekeeper, whose trembling steps, about the middle of\r\nthe second volume, were doomed to guide the hero, or heroine, to the\r\nruinous precincts? Would not the owl have shrieked and the cricket\r\ncried in my very title-page? and could it have been possible for me,\r\nwith a moderate attention to decorum, to introduce any scene more\r\nlively than might be produced by the jocularity of a clownish but\r\nfaithful valet, or the garrulous narrative of the heroine’s\r\n_fille-de-chambre_, when rehearsing the stories of blood and horror\r\nwhich she had heard in the servants’ hall? Again, had my title borne,\r\n“Waverley, a Romance from the German,” what head so obtuse as not to\r\nimage forth a profligate abbot, an oppressive duke, a secret and\r\nmysterious association of Rosycrucians and Illuminati, with all their\r\nproperties of black cowls, caverns, daggers, electrical machines,\r\ntrap-doors, and dark-lanterns? Or if I had rather chosen to call my\r\nwork a “Sentimental Tale,” would it not have been a sufficient presage\r\nof a heroine with a profusion of auburn hair, and a harp, the soft\r\nsolace of her solitary hours, which she fortunately finds always the\r\nmeans of transporting from castle to cottage, although she herself be\r\nsometimes obliged to jump out of a two-pair-of-stairs window, and is\r\nmore than once bewildered on her journey, alone and on foot, without\r\nany guide but a blowzy peasant girl, whose jargon she hardly can\r\nunderstand? Or, again, if my Waverley had been entitled “A Tale of the\r\nTimes,” wouldst thou not, gentle reader, have demanded from me a\r\ndashing sketch of the fashionable world, a few anecdotes of private\r\nscandal thinly veiled, and if lusciously painted, so much the better? a\r\nheroine from Grosvenor Square, and a hero from the Barouche Club or the\r\nFour-in-Hand, with a set of subordinate characters from the elegantes\r\nof Queen Anne Street East, or the dashing heroes of the Bow-Street\r\nOffice? I could proceed in proving the importance of a title-page, and\r\ndisplaying at the same time my own intimate knowledge of the particular\r\ningredients necessary to the composition of romances and novels of\r\nvarious descriptions;—but it is enough, and I scorn to tyrannise longer\r\nover the impatience of my reader, who is doubtless already anxious to\r\nknow the choice made by an author so profoundly versed in the different\r\nbranches of his art.\r\n\r\nBy fixing, then, the date of my story Sixty Years before this present\r\n1st November, 1805, I would have my readers understand, that they will\r\nmeet in the following pages neither a romance of chivalry nor a tale of\r\nmodern manners; that my hero will neither have iron on his shoulders,\r\nas of yore, nor on the heels of his boots, as is the present fashion of\r\nBond Street; and that my damsels will neither be clothed “in purple and\r\nin pall,” like the Lady Alice of an old ballad, nor reduced to the\r\nprimitive nakedness of a modern fashionable at a rout. From this my\r\nchoice of an era the understanding critic may farther presage that the\r\nobject of my tale is more a description of men than manners. A tale of\r\nmanners, to be interesting, must either refer to antiquity so great as\r\nto have become venerable, or it must bear a vivid reflection of those\r\nscenes which are passing daily before our eyes, and are interesting\r\nfrom their novelty. Thus the coat-of-mail of our ancestors, and the\r\ntriple-furred pelisse of our modern beaux, may, though for very\r\ndifferent reasons, be equally fit for the array of a fictitious\r\ncharacter; but who, meaning the costume of his hero to be impressive,\r\nwould willingly attire him in the court dress of George the Second’s\r\nreign, with its no collar, large sleeves, and low pocket-holes? The\r\nsame may be urged, with equal truth, of the Gothic hall, which, with\r\nits darkened and tinted windows, its elevated and gloomy roof, and\r\nmassive oaken table garnished with boar’s-head and rosemary, pheasants\r\nand peacocks, cranes and cygnets, has an excellent effect in fictitious\r\ndescription. Much may also be gained by a lively display of a modern\r\n_fête_, such as we have daily recorded in that part of a newspaper\r\nentitled the Mirror of Fashion, if we contrast these, or either of\r\nthem, with the splendid formality of an entertainment given Sixty Years\r\nSince; and thus it will be readily seen how much the painter of antique\r\nor of fashionable manners gains over him who delineates those of the\r\nlast generation.\r\n\r\nConsidering the disadvantages inseparable from this part of my subject,\r\nI must be understood to have resolved to avoid them as much as\r\npossible, by throwing the force of my narrative upon the characters and\r\npassions of the actors;—those passions common to men in all stages of\r\nsociety, and which have alike agitated the human heart, whether it\r\nthrobbed under the steel corslet of the fifteenth century, the brocaded\r\ncoat of the eighteenth, or the blue frock and white dimity waistcoat of\r\nthe present day.[*] Upon these passions it is no doubt true that the\r\nstate of manners and laws casts a necessary colouring; but the\r\nbearings, to use the language of heraldry, remain the same, though the\r\ntincture may be not only different, but opposed in strong\r\ncontradistinction. The wrath of our ancestors, for example, was\r\ncoloured _gules;_ it broke forth in acts of open and sanguinary\r\nviolence against the objects of its fury. Our malignant feelings, which\r\nmust seek gratification through more indirect channels, and undermine\r\nthe obstacles which they cannot openly bear down, may be rather said to\r\nbe tinctured sable. But the deep-ruling impulse is the same in both\r\ncases; and the proud peer, who can now only ruin his neighbour\r\naccording to law, by protracted suits, is the genuine descendant of the\r\nbaron who wrapped the castle of his competitor in flames, and knocked\r\nhim on the head as he endeavoured to escape from the conflagration. It\r\nis from the great book of Nature, the same through a thousand editions,\r\nwhether of black-letter, or wire-wove and hot-pressed, that I have\r\nventurously essayed to read a chapter to the public. Some favourable\r\nopportunities of contrast have been afforded me by the state of society\r\nin the northern part of the island at the period of my history, and may\r\nserve at once to vary and to illustrate the moral lessons, which I\r\nwould willingly consider as the most important part of my plan;\r\nalthough I am sensible how short these will fall of their aim if I\r\nshall be found unable to mix them with amusement—a task not quite so\r\neasy in this critical generation as it was “Sixty Years Since.”\r\n\r\n[* Alas! that attire, respectable and gentlemanlike in 1805, or\r\nthereabouts, is now as antiquated as the Author of “Waverley” has\r\nhimself become since that period! The reader of fashion will please to\r\nfill up the costume with an embroidered waistcoat of purple velvet or\r\nsilk, and a coat of whatever colour he pleases.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II.\r\nWAVERLEY-HONOUR—A RETROSPECT\r\n\r\n\r\nIt is, then, sixty years since Edward Waverley, the hero of the\r\nfollowing pages, took leave of his family, to join the regiment of\r\ndragoons in which he had lately obtained a commission. It was a\r\nmelancholy day at Waverley-Honour when the young officer parted with\r\nSir Everard, the affectionate old uncle to whose title and estate he\r\nwas presumptive heir.\r\n\r\nA difference in political opinions had early separated the Baronet from\r\nhis younger brother Richard Waverley, the father of our hero. Sir\r\nEverard had inherited from his sires the whole train of Tory or\r\nHigh-Church predilections and prejudices which had distinguished the\r\nhouse of Waverley since the Great Civil War. Richard, on the contrary,\r\nwho was ten years younger, beheld himself born to the fortune of a\r\nsecond brother, and anticipated neither dignity nor entertainment in\r\nsustaining the character of Will Wimble. He saw early that, to succeed\r\nin the race of life, it was necessary he should carry as little weight\r\nas possible. Painters talk of the difficulty of expressing the\r\nexistence of compound passions in the same features at the same moment;\r\nit would be no less difficult for the moralist to analyse the mixed\r\nmotives which unite to form the impulse of our actions. Richard\r\nWaverley read and satisfied himself from history and sound argument\r\nthat, in the words of the old song,\r\n\r\nPassive obedience was a jest,\r\nAnd pshaw! was non-resistance;\r\n\r\n\r\nyet reason would have probably been unable to combat and remove\r\nhereditary prejudice could Richard have anticipated that his elder\r\nbrother, Sir Everard, taking to heart an early disappointment, would\r\nhave remained a bachelor at seventy-two. The prospect of succession,\r\nhowever remote, might in that case have led him to endure dragging\r\nthrough the greater part of his life as “Master Richard at the Hall,\r\nthe Baronet’s brother,” in the hope that ere its conclusion he should\r\nbe distinguished as Sir Richard Waverley of Waverley-Honour, successor\r\nto a princely estate, and to extended political connections as head of\r\nthe county interest in the shire where it lay.\r\n\r\nBut this was a consummation of things not to be expected at Richard’s\r\noutset, when Sir Everard was in the prime of life, and certain to be an\r\nacceptable suitor in almost any family, whether wealth or beauty should\r\nbe the object of his pursuit, and when, indeed, his speedy marriage was\r\na report which regularly amused the neighbourhood once a year. His\r\nyounger brother saw no practicable road to independence save that of\r\nrelying upon his own exertions, and adopting a political creed more\r\nconsonant both to reason and his own interest than the hereditary faith\r\nof Sir Everard in High-Church and in the house of Stuart. He therefore\r\nread his recantation at the beginning of his career, and entered life\r\nas an avowed Whig and friend of the Hanover succession.\r\n\r\nThe ministry of George the First’s time were prudently anxious to\r\ndiminish the phalanx of opposition. The Tory nobility, depending for\r\ntheir reflected lustre upon the sunshine of a court, had for some time\r\nbeen gradually reconciling themselves to the new dynasty. But the\r\nwealthy country gentlemen of England, a rank which retained, with much\r\nof ancient manners and primitive integrity, a great proportion of\r\nobstinate and unyielding prejudice, stood aloof in haughty and sullen\r\nopposition, and cast many a look of mingled regret and hope to Bois le\r\nDue, Avignon, and Italy.[*] The accession of the near relation of one\r\nof those steady and inflexible opponents was considered as a means of\r\nbringing over more converts, and therefore Richard Waverley met with a\r\nshare of ministerial favour more than proportioned to his talents or\r\nhis political importance. It was, however, discovered that he had\r\nrespectable talents for public business, and the first admittance to\r\nthe minister’s levee being negotiated, his success became rapid. Sir\r\nEverard learned from the public News-Letter, first that Richard\r\nWaverley, Esquire, was returned for the ministerial borough of\r\nBarterfaith; next, that Richard Waverley, Esquire, had taken a\r\ndistinguished part in the debate upon the Excise Bill in the support of\r\ngovernment; and, lastly, that Richard Waverley, Esquire, had been\r\nhonoured with a seat at one of those boards where the pleasure of\r\nserving the country is combined with other important gratifications,\r\nwhich, to render them the more acceptable, occur regularly once a\r\nquarter.\r\n\r\n[* Where the Chevalier St. George, or, as he was termed, the Old\r\nPretender, held his exiled court, as his situation compelled him to\r\nshift his place of residence.]\r\n\r\n\r\nAlthough these events followed each other so closely that the sagacity\r\nof the editor of a modern newspaper would have presaged the two last\r\neven while he announced the first, yet they came upon Sir Everard\r\ngradually, and drop by drop, as it were, distilled through the cool and\r\nprocrastinating alembic of “Dyer’s Weekly Letter.”[1] For it may be\r\nobserved in passing, that instead of those mail-coaches, by means of\r\nwhich every mechanic at his six-penny club, may nightly learn from\r\ntwenty contradictory channels the yesterday’s news of the capital, a\r\nweekly post brought, in those days, to Waverley-Honour, a Weekly\r\nIntelligencer, which, after it had gratified Sir Everard’s curiosity,\r\nhis sister’s, and that of his aged butler, was regularly transferred\r\nfrom the Hall to the Rectory, from the Rectory to Squire Stubbs’s at\r\nthe Grange, from the Squire to the Baronet’s steward at his neat white\r\nhouse on the heath, from the steward to the bailiff, and from him\r\nthrough a huge circle of honest dames and gaffers, by whose hard and\r\nhorny hands it was generally worn to pieces in about a month after its\r\narrival.\r\n\r\nThis slow succession of intelligence was of some advantage to Richard\r\nWaverley in the case before us; for, had the sum total of his\r\nenormities reached the ears of Sir Everard at once, there can be no\r\ndoubt that the new commissioner would have had little reason to pique\r\nhimself on the success of his politics. The Baronet, although the\r\nmildest of human beings, was not without sensitive points in his\r\ncharacter; his brother’s conduct had wounded these deeply; the Waverley\r\nestate was fettered by no entail (for it had never entered into the\r\nhead of any of its former possessors that one of their progeny could be\r\nguilty of the atrocities laid by “Dyer’s Letter” to the door of\r\nRichard), and if it had, the marriage of the proprietor might have been\r\nfatal to a collateral heir. These various ideas floated through the\r\nbrain of Sir Everard without, however, producing any determined\r\nconclusion.\r\n\r\nHe examined the tree of his genealogy, which, emblazoned with many an\r\nemblematic mark of honour and heroic achievement, hung upon the\r\nwell-varnished wainscot of his hall. The nearest descendants of Sir\r\nHildebrand Waverley, failing those of his eldest son Wilfred, of whom\r\nSir Everard and his brother were the only representatives, were, as\r\nthis honoured register informed him (and, indeed, as he himself well\r\nknew), the Waverleys of Highley Park, com. Hants; with whom the main\r\nbranch, or rather stock, of the house had renounced all connection\r\nsince the great law-suit in 1670.\r\n\r\nThis degenerate scion had committed a farther offence against the head\r\nand source of their gentility, by the intermarriage of their\r\nrepresentative with Judith, heiress of Oliver Bradshawe, of Highley\r\nPark, whose arms, the same with those of Bradshawe the regicide, they\r\nhad quartered with the ancient coat of Waverley. These offences,\r\nhowever, had vanished from Sir Everard’s recollection in the heat of\r\nhis resentment; and had Lawyer Clippurse, for whom his groom was\r\ndespatched express, arrived but an hour earlier, he might have had the\r\nbenefit of drawing a new settlement of the lordship and manor of\r\nWaverley-Honour, with all its dependencies. But an hour of cool\r\nreflection is a great matter when employed in weighing the comparative\r\nevil of two measures to neither of which we are internally partial.\r\nLawyer Clippurse found his patron involved in a deep study, which he\r\nwas too respectful to disturb, otherwise than by producing his paper\r\nand leathern ink-case, as prepared to minute his honour’s commands.\r\nEven this slight manœuvre was embarrassing to Sir Everard, who felt it\r\nas a reproach to his indecision. He looked at the attorney with some\r\ndesire to issue his fiat, when the sun, emerging from behind a cloud,\r\npoured at once its chequered light through the stained window of the\r\ngloomy cabinet in which they were seated. The Baronet’s eye, as he\r\nraised it to the splendour, fell right upon the central scutcheon,\r\ninpressed with the same device which his ancestor was said to have\r\nborne in the field of Hastings,—three ermines passant, argent, in a\r\nfield azure, with its appropriate motto, _sans tache_. “May our name\r\nrather perish,” exclaimed Sir Everard, “than that ancient and loyal\r\nsymbol should be blended with the dishonoured insignia of a traitorous\r\nRoundhead!”\r\n\r\nAll this was the effect of the glimpse of a sunbeam, just sufficient to\r\nlight Lawyer Clippurse to mend his pen. The pen was mended in vain. The\r\nattorney was dismissed, with directions to hold himself in readiness on\r\nthe first summons.\r\n\r\nThe apparition of Lawyer Clippurse at the Hall occasioned much\r\nspeculation in that portion of the world to which Waverley-Honour\r\nformed the centre. But the more judicious politicians of this microcosm\r\naugured yet worse consequences to Richard Waverley from a movement\r\nwhich shortly followed his apostasy. This was no less than an excursion\r\nof the Baronet in his coach-and-six, with four attendants in rich\r\nliveries, to make a visit of some duration to a noble peer on the\r\nconfines of the shire, of untainted descent, steady Tory principles,\r\nand the happy father of six unmarried and accomplished daughters.\r\n\r\nSir Everard’s reception in this family was, as it may be easily\r\nconceived, sufficiently favourable; but of the six young ladies, his\r\ntaste unfortunately determined him in favour of Lady Emily, the\r\nyoungest, who received his attentions with an embarrassment which\r\nshowed at once that she durst not decline them, and that they afforded\r\nher anything but pleasure.\r\n\r\nSir Everard could not but perceive something uncommon in the restrained\r\nemotions which the young lady testified at the advances he hazarded;\r\nbut, assured by the prudent Countess that they were the natural effects\r\nof a retired education, the sacrifice might have been completed, as\r\ndoubtless has happened in many similar instances, had it not been for\r\nthe courage of an elder sister, who revealed to the wealthy suitor that\r\nLady Emily’s affections were fixed upon a young soldier of fortune, a\r\nnear relation of her own.\r\n\r\nSir Everard manifested great emotion on receiving this intelligence,\r\nwhich was confirmed to him, in a private interview, by the young lady\r\nherself, although under the most dreadful apprehensions of her father’s\r\nindignation.\r\n\r\nHonour and generosity were hereditary attributes of the house of\r\nWaverley. With a grace and delicacy worthy the hero of a romance, Sir\r\nEverard withdrew his claim to the hand of Lady Emily. He had even,\r\nbefore leaving Blandeville Castle, the address to extort from her\r\nfather a consent to her union with the object of her choice. What\r\narguments he used on this point cannot exactly be known, for Sir\r\nEverard was never supposed strong in the powers of persuasion; but the\r\nyoung officer, immediately after this transaction, rose in the army\r\nwith a rapidity far surpassing the usual pace of unpatronised\r\nprofessional merit, although, to outward appearance, that was all he\r\nhad to depend upon.\r\n\r\nThe shock which Sir Everard encountered upon this occasion, although\r\ndiminished by the consciousness of having acted virtuously and\r\ngenerously had its effect upon his future life. His resolution of\r\nmarriage had been adopted in a fit of indignation; the labour of\r\ncourtship did not quite suit the dignified indolence of his habits; he\r\nhad but just escaped the risk of marrying a woman who could never love\r\nhim, and his pride could not be greatly flattered by the termination of\r\nhis amour, even if his heart had not suffered. The result of the whole\r\nmatter was his return to Waverley-Honour without any transfer of his\r\naffections, notwithstanding the sighs and languishments of the fair\r\ntell-tale, who had revealed, in mere sisterly affection, the secret of\r\nLady Emily’s attachment, and in despite of the nods, winks, and\r\ninnuendos of the officious lady mother, and the grave eulogiums which\r\nthe Earl pronounced successively on the prudence, and good sense, and\r\nadmirable dispositions, of his first, second, third, fourth, and fifth\r\ndaughters.\r\n\r\nThe memory of his unsuccessful amour was with Sir Everard, as with many\r\nmore of his temper, at once shy, proud, sensitive, and indolent, a\r\nbeacon against exposing himself to similar mortification, pain, and\r\nfruitless exertion for the time to come. He continued to live at\r\nWaverley-Honour in the style of an old English gentleman, of an ancient\r\ndescent and opulent fortune. His sister, Miss Rachel Waverley, presided\r\nat his table; and they became, by degrees, an old bachelor and an\r\nancient maiden lady, the gentlest and kindest of the votaries of\r\ncelibacy.\r\n\r\nThe vehemence of Sir Everard’s resentment against his brother was but\r\nshort-lived; yet his dislike to the Whig and the placeman, though\r\nunable to stimulate him to resume any active measures prejudicial to\r\nRichard’s interest, in the succession to the family estate, continued\r\nto maintain the coldness between them. Richard knew enough of the\r\nworld, and of his brother’s temper, to believe that by any\r\nill-considered or precipitate advances on his part, he might turn\r\npassive dislike into a more active principle. It was accident,\r\ntherefore, which at length occasioned a renewal of their intercourse.\r\nRichard had married a young woman of rank, by whose family interest and\r\nprivate fortune he hoped to advance his career. In her right he became\r\npossessor of a manor of some value, at the distance of a few miles from\r\nWaverley-Honour.\r\n\r\nLittle Edward, the hero of our tale, then in his fifth year, was their\r\nonly child. It chanced that the infant with his maid had strayed one\r\nmorning to a mile’s distance from the avenue of Brerewood Lodge, his\r\nfather’s seat. Their attention was attracted by a carriage drawn by six\r\nstately long-tailed black horses, and with as much carving and gilding\r\nas would have done honour to my lord mayor’s. It was waiting for the\r\nowner, who was at a little distance inspecting the progress of a\r\nhalf-built farm-house. I know not whether the boy’s nurse had been a\r\nWelsh or a Scotch-woman, or in what manner he associated a shield\r\nemblazoned with three ermines with the idea of personal property, but\r\nhe no sooner beheld this family emblem than he stoutly determined on\r\nvindicating his right to the splendid vehicle on which it was\r\ndisplayed. The Baronet arrived while the boy’s maid was in vain\r\nendeavouring to make him desist from his determination to appropriate\r\nthe gilded coach-and-six. The _rencontre_ was at a happy moment for\r\nEdward, as his uncle had been just eyeing wistfully, with something of\r\na feeling like envy, the chubby boys of the stout yeoman whose mansion\r\nwas building by his direction. In the round-faced rosy cherub before\r\nhim, bearing his eye and his name, and vindicating a hereditary title\r\nto his family, affection, and patronage, by means of a tie which Sir\r\nEverard held as sacred as either Garter or Blue-mantle, Providence\r\nseemed to have granted to him the very object best calculated to fill\r\nup the void in his hopes and affections. Sir Everard returned to\r\nWaverley-Hall upon a led horse, which was kept in readiness for him,\r\nwhile the child and his attendant were sent home in the carriage to\r\nBrerewood Lodge, with such a message as opened to Richard Waverley a\r\ndoor of reconciliation with his elder brother.\r\n\r\nTheir intercourse, however, though thus renewed, continued to be rather\r\nformal and civil than partaking of brotherly cordiality; yet it was\r\nsufficient to the wishes of both parties. Sir Everard obtained, in the\r\nfrequent society of his little nephew, something on which his\r\nhereditary pride might found the anticipated pleasure of a continuation\r\nof his lineage, and where his kind and gentle affections could at the\r\nsame time fully exercise themselves. For Richard Waverley, he beheld in\r\nthe growing attachment between the uncle and nephew the means of\r\nsecuring his son’s, if not his own, succession to the hereditary\r\nestate, which he felt would be rather endangered than promoted by any\r\nattempt on his own part towards a closer intimacy with a man of Sir\r\nEverard’s habits and opinions.\r\n\r\nThus, by a sort of tacit compromise, little Edward was permitted to\r\npass the greater part of the year at the Hall, and appeared to stand in\r\nthe same intimate relation to both families, although their mutual\r\nintercourse was otherwise limited to formal messages and more formal\r\nvisits. The education of the youth was regulated alternately by the\r\ntaste and opinions of his uncle and of his father. But more of this in\r\na subsequent chapter.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III.\r\nEDUCATION\r\n\r\n\r\nThe education of our hero, Edward Waverley, was of a nature somewhat\r\ndesultory. In infancy his health suffered, or was supposed to suffer\r\n(which is quite the same thing), by the air of London. As soon,\r\ntherefore, as official duties, attendance on Parliament, or the\r\nprosecution of any of his plans of interest or ambition, called his\r\nfather to town, which was his usual residence for eight months in the\r\nyear, Edward was transferred to Waverley-Honour, and experienced a\r\ntotal change of instructors and of lessons, as well as of residence.\r\nThis might have been remedied had his father placed him under the\r\nsuperintendence of a permanent tutor. But he considered that one of his\r\nchoosing would probably have been unacceptable at Waverley-Honour, and\r\nthat such a selection as Sir Everard might have made, were the matter\r\nleft to him, would have burdened him with a disagreeable inmate, if not\r\na political spy, in his family. He therefore prevailed upon his private\r\nsecretary, a young man of taste and accomplishments, to bestow an hour\r\nor two on Edward’s education while at Brerewood Lodge, and left his\r\nuncle answerable for his improvement in literature while an inmate at\r\nthe Hall. This was in some degree respectably provided for. Sir\r\nEverard’s chaplain, an Oxonian, who had lost his fellowship for\r\ndeclining to take the oaths at the accession of George I, was not only\r\nan excellent classical scholar, but reasonably skilled in science, and\r\nmaster of most modern languages. He was, however, old and indulgent,\r\nand the recurring interregnum, during which Edward was entirely freed\r\nfrom his discipline, occasioned such a relaxation of authority, that\r\nthe youth was permitted, in a great measure, to learn as he pleased,\r\nwhat he pleased, and when he pleased. This slackness of rule might have\r\nbeen ruinous to a boy of slow understanding, who, feeling labour in the\r\nacquisition of knowledge, would have altogether neglected it, save for\r\nthe command of a taskmaster; and it might have proved equally dangerous\r\nto a youth whose animal spirits were more powerful than his imagination\r\nor his feelings, and whom the irresistible influence of Alma would have\r\nengaged in field-sports from morning till night. But the character of\r\nEdward Waverley was remote from either of these. His powers of\r\napprehension were so uncommonly quick as almost to resemble intuition,\r\nand the chief care of his preceptor was to prevent him, as a sportsman\r\nwould phrase it, from over-running his game—that is, from acquiring his\r\nknowledge in a slight, flimsy, and inadequate manner. And here the\r\ninstructor had to combat another propensity too often united with\r\nbrilliancy of fancy and vivacity of talent—that indolence, namely, of\r\ndisposition, which can only be stirred by some strong motive of\r\ngratification, and which renounces study as soon as curiosity is\r\ngratified, the pleasure of conquering the first difficulties exhausted,\r\nand the novelty of pursuit at an end. Edward would throw himself with\r\nspirit upon any classical author of which his preceptor proposed the\r\nperusal, make himself master of the style so far as to understand the\r\nstory, and, if that pleased or interested him, he finished the volume.\r\nBut it was in vain to attempt fixing his attention on critical\r\ndistinctions of philology, upon the difference of idiom, the beauty of\r\nfelicitous expression, or the artificial combinations of syntax. “I can\r\nread and understand a Latin author,” said young Edward, with the\r\nself-confidence and rash reasoning of fifteen, “and Scaliger or Bentley\r\ncould not do much more.” Alas! while he was thus permitted to read only\r\nfor the gratification of his amusement, he foresaw not that he was\r\nlosing for ever the opportunity of acquiring habits of firm and\r\nassiduous application, of gaining the art of controlling, directing,\r\nand concentrating the powers of his mind for earnest investigation—an\r\nart far more essential than even that intimate acquaintance with\r\nclassical learning which is the primary object of study.\r\n\r\nI am aware I may be here reminded of the necessity of rendering\r\ninstruction agreeable to youth, and of Tasso’s infusion of honey into\r\nthe medicine prepared for a child; but an age in which children are\r\ntaught the driest doctrines by the insinuating method of instructive\r\ngames, has little reason to dread the consequences of study being\r\nrendered too serious or severe. The history of England is now reduced\r\nto a game at cards, the problems of mathematics to puzzles and riddles,\r\nand the doctrines of arithmetic may, we are assured, be sufficiently\r\nacquired by spending a few hours a week at a new and complicated\r\nedition of the Royal Game of the Goose. There wants but one step\r\nfurther, and the Creed and Ten Commandments may be taught in the same\r\nmanner, without the necessity of the grave face, deliberate tone of\r\nrecital, and devout attention, hitherto exacted from the well-governed\r\nchildhood of this realm. It may, in the meantime, be subject of serious\r\nconsideration, whether those who are accustomed only to acquire\r\ninstruction through the medium of amusement may not be brought to\r\nreject that which approaches under the aspect of study; whether those\r\nwho learn history by the cards may not be led to prefer the means to\r\nthe end; and whether, were we to teach religion in the way of sport,\r\nour pupils may not thereby be gradually induced to make sport of their\r\nreligion. To our young hero, who was permitted to seek his instruction\r\nonly according to the bent of his own mind, and who, of consequence,\r\nonly sought it so long as it afforded him amusement, the indulgence of\r\nhis tutors was attended with evil consequences, which long continued to\r\ninfluence his character, happiness, and utility.\r\n\r\nEdward’s power of imagination and love of literature, although the\r\nformer was vivid and the latter ardent, were so far from affording a\r\nremedy to this peculiar evil, that they rather inflamed and increased\r\nits violence. The library at Waverley-Honour, a large Gothic room, with\r\ndouble arches and a gallery, contained such a miscellaneous and\r\nextensive collection of volumes as had been assembled together, during\r\nthe course of two hundred years, by a family which had been always\r\nwealthy, and inclined, of course, as a mark of splendour, to furnish\r\ntheir shelves with the current literature of the day, without much\r\nscrutiny or nicety of discrimination. Throughout this ample realm\r\nEdward was permitted to roam at large. His tutor had his own studies;\r\nand church politics and controversial divinity, together with a love of\r\nlearned ease, though they did not withdraw his attention at stated\r\ntimes from the progress of his patron’s presumptive heir, induced him\r\nreadily to grasp at any apology for not extending a strict and\r\nregulated survey towards his general studies. Sir Everard had never\r\nbeen himself a student, and, like his sister, Miss Rachel Waverley, he\r\nheld the common doctrine, that idleness is incompatible with reading of\r\nany kind, and that the mere tracing the alphabetical characters with\r\nthe eye is in itself a useful and meritorious task, without\r\nscrupulously considering what ideas or doctrines they may happen to\r\nconvey. With a desire of amusement, therefore, which better discipline\r\nmight soon have converted into a thirst for knowledge, young Waverley\r\ndrove through the sea of books like a vessel without a pilot or a\r\nrudder. Nothing perhaps increases by indulgence more than a desultory\r\nhabit of reading, especially under such opportunities of gratifying it.\r\nI believe one reason why such numerous instances of erudition occur\r\namong the lower ranks is, that, with the same powers of mind, the poor\r\nstudent is limited to a narrow circle for indulging his passion for\r\nbooks, and must necessarily make himself master of the few he possesses\r\nere he can acquire more. Edward, on the contrary, like the epicure who\r\nonly deigned to take a single morsel from the sunny side of a peach,\r\nread no volume a moment after it ceased to excite his curiosity or\r\ninterest; and it necessarily happened, that the habit of seeking only\r\nthis sort of gratification rendered it daily more difficult of\r\nattainment, till the passion for reading, like other strong appetites,\r\nproduced by indulgence a sort of satiety.\r\n\r\nEre he attained this indifference, however, he had read, and stored in\r\na memory of uncommon tenacity, much curious, though ill-arranged and\r\nmiscellaneous information. In English literature he was master of\r\nShakespeare and Milton, of our earlier dramatic authors, of many\r\npicturesque and interesting passages from our old historical\r\nchronicles, and was particularly well acquainted with Spenser, Drayton,\r\nand other poets who have exercised themselves on romantic fiction, of\r\nall themes the most fascinating to a youthful imagination, before the\r\npassions have roused themselves and demand poetry of a more sentimental\r\ndescription. In this respect his acquaintance with Italian opened him\r\nyet a wider range. He had perused the numerous romantic poems, which,\r\nfrom the days of Pulci, have been a favourite exercise of the wits of\r\nItaly, and had sought gratification in the numerous collections of\r\n_novelle_, which were brought forth by the genius of that elegant\r\nthough luxurious nation, in emulation of the “Decameron.” In classical\r\nliterature, Waverley had made the usual progress, and read the usual\r\nauthors; and the French had afforded him an almost exhaustless\r\ncollection of memoirs, scarcely more faithful than romances, and of\r\nromances so well written as hardly to be distinguished from memoirs.\r\nThe splendid pages of Froissart, with his heart-stirring and\r\neye-dazzling descriptions of war and of tournaments, were among his\r\nchief favourites; and from those of Brantome and De la Noue he learned\r\nto compare the wild and loose, yet superstitious, character of the\r\nnobles of the League with the stern, rigid, and sometimes turbulent\r\ndisposition of the Huguenot party. The Spanish had contributed to his\r\nstock of chivalrous and romantic lore. The earlier literature of the\r\nnorthern nations did not escape the study of one who read rather to\r\nawaken the imagination than to benefit the understanding. And yet,\r\nknowing much that is known but to few, Edward Waverley might justly be\r\nconsidered as ignorant, since he knew little of what adds dignity to\r\nman, and qualifies him to support and adorn an elevated situation in\r\nsociety.\r\n\r\nThe occasional attention of his parents might indeed have been of\r\nservice to prevent the dissipation of mind incidental to such a\r\ndesultory course of reading. But his mother died in the seventh year\r\nafter the reconciliation between the brothers, and Richard Waverley\r\nhimself, who, after this event, resided more constantly in London, was\r\ntoo much interested in his own plans of wealth and ambition to notice\r\nmore respecting Edward than that he was of a very bookish turn, and\r\nprobably destined to be a bishop. If he could have discovered and\r\nanalysed his son’s waking dreams, he would have formed a very different\r\nconclusion.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IV.\r\nCASTLE-BUILDING\r\n\r\n\r\nI have already hinted that the dainty, squeamish, and fastidious taste\r\nacquired by a surfeit of idle reading had not only rendered our hero\r\nunfit for serious and sober study, but had even disgusted him in some\r\ndegree with that in which he had hitherto indulged.\r\n\r\nHe was in his sixteenth year when his habits of abstraction and love of\r\nsolitude became so much marked as to excite Sir Everard’s affectionate\r\napprehension. He tried to counterbalance these propensities by engaging\r\nhis nephew in field-sports, which had been the chief pleasure of his\r\nown youthful days. But although Edward eagerly carried the gun for one\r\nseason, yet when practice had given him some dexterity, the pastime\r\nceased to afford him amusement.\r\n\r\nIn the succeeding spring, the perusal of old Isaac Walton’s fascinating\r\nvolume determined Edward to become “a brother of the angle.” But of all\r\ndiversions which ingenuity ever devised for the relief of idleness,\r\nfishing is the worst qualified to amuse a man who is at once indolent\r\nand impatient; and our hero’s rod was speedily flung aside. Society and\r\nexample, which, more than any other motives, master and sway the\r\nnatural bent of our passions, might have had their usual effect upon\r\nthe youthful visionary. But the neighbourhood was thinly inhabited, and\r\nthe home-bred young squires whom it afforded were not of a class fit to\r\nform Edward’s usual companions, far less to excite him to emulation in\r\nthe practice of those pastimes which composed the serious business of\r\ntheir lives.\r\n\r\nThere were a few other youths of better education and a more liberal\r\ncharacter, but from their society also our hero was in some degree\r\nexcluded. Sir Everard had, upon the death of Queen Anne, resigned his\r\nseat in Parliament, and, as his age increased and the number of his\r\ncontemporaries diminished, had gradually withdrawn himself from\r\nsociety; so that when, upon any particular occasion, Edward mingled\r\nwith accomplished and well-educated young men of his own rank and\r\nexpectations, he felt an inferiority in their company, not so much from\r\ndeficiency of information, as from the want of the skill to command and\r\nto arrange that which he possessed. A deep and increasing sensibility\r\nadded to this dislike of society. The idea of having committed the\r\nslightest solecism in politeness, whether real or imaginary, was agony\r\nto him; for perhaps even guilt itself does not impose upon some minds\r\nso keen a sense of shame and remorse, as a modest, sensitive, and\r\ninexperienced youth feels from the consciousness of having neglected\r\netiquette or excited ridicule. Where we are not at ease, we cannot be\r\nhappy; and therefore it is not surprising that Edward Waverley supposed\r\nthat he disliked and was unfitted for society, merely because he had\r\nnot yet acquired the habit of living in it with ease and comfort, and\r\nof reciprocally giving and receiving pleasure.\r\n\r\nThe hours he spent with his uncle and aunt were exhausted in listening\r\nto the oft-repeated tale of narrative old age. Yet even there his\r\nimagination, the predominant faculty of his mind, was frequently\r\nexcited. Family tradition and genealogical history, upon which much of\r\nSir Everard’s discourse turned, is the very reverse of amber, which,\r\nitself a valuable substance, usually includes flies, straws, and other\r\ntrifles; whereas these studies, being themselves very insignificant and\r\ntrifling, do nevertheless serve to perpetuate a great deal of what is\r\nrare and valuable in ancient manners, and to record many curious and\r\nminute facts which could have been preserved and conveyed through no\r\nother medium. If, therefore, Edward Waverley yawned at times over the\r\ndry deduction of his line of ancestors, with their various\r\nintermarriages, and inwardly deprecated the remorseless and protracted\r\naccuracy with which the worthy Sir Everard rehearsed the various\r\ndegrees of propinquity between the house of Waverley-Honour and the\r\ndoughty barons, knights, and squires to whom they stood allied; if\r\n(notwithstanding his obligations to the three ermines passant) he\r\nsometimes cursed in his heart the jargon of heraldry, its griffins, its\r\nmoldwarps, its wyverns, and its dragons, with all the bitterness of\r\nHotspur himself, there were moments when these communications\r\ninterested his fancy and rewarded his attention.\r\n\r\nThe deeds of Wilibert of Waverley in the Holy Land, his long absence\r\nand perilous adventures, his supposed death, and his return on the\r\nevening when the betrothed of his heart had wedded the hero who had\r\nprotected her from insult and oppression during his absence; the\r\ngenerosity with which the Crusader relinquished his claims, and sought\r\nin a neighbouring cloister that peace which passeth not away;[2]—to\r\nthese and similar tales he would hearken till his heart glowed and his\r\neye glistened. Nor was he less affected when his aunt, Mrs. Rachel,\r\nnarrated the sufferings and fortitude of Lady Alice Waverley during the\r\nGreat Civil War. The benevolent features of the venerable spinster\r\nkindled into more majestic expression as she told how Charles had,\r\nafter the field of Worcester, found a day’s refuge at Waverley-Honour,\r\nand how, when a troop of cavalry were approaching to search the\r\nmansion, Lady Alice dismissed her youngest son with a handful of\r\ndomestics, charging them to make good with their lives an hour’s\r\ndiversion, that the king might have that space for escape. “And, God\r\nhelp her,” would Mrs. Rachel continue, fixing her eyes upon the\r\nheroine’s portrait as she spoke, “full dearly did she purchase the\r\nsafety of her prince with the life of her darling child. They brought\r\nhim here a prisoner, mortally wounded; and you may trace the drops of\r\nhis blood from the great hall door along the little gallery, and up to\r\nthe saloon, where they laid him down to die at his mother’s feet. But\r\nthere was comfort exchanged between them; for he knew, from the glance\r\nof his mother’s eye, that the purpose of his desperate defence was\r\nattained. Ah! I remember,” she continued, “I remember well to have seen\r\none that knew and loved him. Miss Lucy Saint Aubin lived and died a\r\nmaid for his sake, though one of the most beautiful and wealthy matches\r\nin this country; all the world ran after her, but she wore widow’s\r\nmourning all her life for poor William, for they were betrothed though\r\nnot married, and died in—I cannot think of the date; but I remember, in\r\nthe November of that very year, when she found herself sinking, she\r\ndesired to be brought to Waverley-Honour once more, and visited all the\r\nplaces where she had been with my grand-uncle, and caused the carpets\r\nto be raised that she might trace the impression of his blood, and if\r\ntears could have washed it out, it had not been there now; for there\r\nwas not a dry eye in the house. You would have thought, Edward, that\r\nthe very trees mourned for her, for their leaves dropt around her\r\nwithout a gust of wind, and, indeed, she looked like one that would\r\nnever see them green again.”\r\n\r\nFrom such legends our hero would steal away to indulge the fancies they\r\nexcited. In the corner of the large and sombre library, with no other\r\nlight than was afforded by the decaying brands on its ponderous and\r\nample hearth, he would exercise for hours that internal sorcery by\r\nwhich past or imaginary events are presented in action, as it were, to\r\nthe eye of the muser. Then arose in long and fair array the splendour\r\nof the bridal feast at Waverley-Castle; the tall and emaciated form of\r\nits real lord, as he stood in his pilgrim’s weeds, an unnoticed\r\nspectator of the festivities of his supposed heir and intended bride;\r\nthe electrical shock occasioned by the discovery; the springing of the\r\nvassals to arms; the astonishment of the bridegroom; the terror and\r\nconfusion of the bride; the agony with which Wilibert observed that her\r\nheart as well as consent was in these nuptials; the air of dignity, yet\r\nof deep feeling, with which he flung down the half-drawn sword, and\r\nturned away for ever from the house of his ancestors. Then would he\r\nchange the scene, and fancy would at his wish represent Aunt Rachel’s\r\ntragedy. He saw the Lady Waverley seated in her bower, her ear strained\r\nto every sound, her heart throbbing with double agony, now listening to\r\nthe decaying echo of the hoofs of the king’s horse, and when that had\r\ndied away, hearing in every breeze that shook the trees of the park,\r\nthe noise of the remote skirmish. A distant sound is heard like the\r\nrushing of a swoln stream; it comes nearer, and Edward can plainly\r\ndistinguish the galloping of horses, the cries and shouts of men, with\r\nstraggling pistol-shots between, rolling forwards to the Hall. The lady\r\nstarts up—a terrified menial rushes in—but why pursue such a\r\ndescription?\r\n\r\nAs living in this ideal world became daily more delectable to our hero,\r\ninterruption was disagreeable in proportion. The extensive domain that\r\nsurrounded the Hall, which, far exceeding the dimensions of a park, was\r\nusually termed Waverley-Chase, had originally been forest ground, and\r\nstill, though broken by extensive glades, in which the young deer were\r\nsporting, retained its pristine and savage character. It was traversed\r\nby broad avenues, in many places half grown up with brush-wood, where\r\nthe beauties of former days used to take their stand to see the stag\r\ncoursed with greyhounds, or to gain an aim at him with the crossbow. In\r\none spot, distinguished by a moss-grown Gothic monument, which retained\r\nthe name of Queen’s Standing, Elizabeth herself was said to have\r\npierced seven bucks with her own arrows. This was a very favourite\r\nhaunt of Waverley. At other times, with his gun and his spaniel, which\r\nserved as an apology to others, and with a book in his pocket, which\r\nperhaps served as an apology to himself, he used to pursue one of these\r\nlong avenues, which, after an ascending sweep of four miles, gradually\r\nnarrowed into a rude and contracted path through the cliffy and woody\r\npass called Mirkwood Dingle, and opened suddenly upon a deep, dark, and\r\nsmall lake, named, from the same cause, Mirkwood-Mere. There stood, in\r\nformer times, a solitary tower upon a rock almost surrounded by the\r\nwater, which had acquired the name of the Strength of Waverley, because\r\nin perilous times it had often been the refuge of the family. There, in\r\nthe wars of York and Lancaster, the last adherents of the Red Rose who\r\ndared to maintain her cause carried on a harassing and predatory\r\nwarfare, till the stronghold was reduced by the celebrated Richard of\r\nGloucester. Here, too, a party of Cavaliers long maintained themselves\r\nunder Nigel Waverley, elder brother of that William whose fate Aunt\r\nRachel commemorated. Through these scenes it was that Edward loved to\r\n“chew the cud of sweet and bitter fancy,” and, like a child among his\r\ntoys, culled and arranged, from the splendid yet useless imagery and\r\nemblems with which his imagination was stored, visions as brilliant and\r\nas fading as those of an evening sky. The effect of this indulgence\r\nupon his temper and character will appear in the next chapter.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER V.\r\nCHOICE OF A PROFESSION\r\n\r\n\r\nFrom the minuteness with which I have traced Waverley’s pursuits, and\r\nthe bias which these unavoidably communicated to his imagination, the\r\nreader may perhaps anticipate, in the following tale, an imitation of\r\nthe romance of Cervantes. But he will do my prudence injustice in the\r\nsupposition. My intention is not to follow the steps of that inimitable\r\nauthor, in describing such total perversion of intellect as\r\nmisconstrues the objects actually presented to the senses, but that\r\nmore common aberration from sound judgment, which apprehends\r\noccurrences indeed in their reality, but communicates to them a\r\ntincture of its own romantic tone and colouring. So far was Edward\r\nWaverley from expecting general sympathy with his own feelings, or\r\nconcluding that the present state of things was calculated to exhibit\r\nthe reality of those visions in which he loved to indulge, that he\r\ndreaded nothing more than the detection of such sentiments as were\r\ndictated by his musings. He neither had nor wished to have a confidant,\r\nwith whom to communicate his reveries; and so sensible was he of the\r\nridicule attached to them, that, had he been to choose between any\r\npunishment short of ignominy, and the necessity of giving a cold and\r\ncomposed account of the ideal world in which he lived the better part\r\nof his days, I think he would not have hesitated to prefer the former\r\ninfliction. This secrecy became doubly precious as he felt in advancing\r\nlife the influence of the awakening passions. Female forms of exquisite\r\ngrace and beauty began to mingle in his mental adventures; nor was he\r\nlong without looking abroad to compare the creatures of his own\r\nimagination with the females of actual life.\r\n\r\nThe list of the beauties who displayed their hebdomadal finery at the\r\nparish church of Waverley was neither numerous nor select. By far the\r\nmost passable was Miss Sissly, or, as she rather chose to be called,\r\nMiss Cecilia Stubbs, daughter of Squire Stubbs at the Grange. I know\r\nnot whether it was by the “merest accident in the world,” a phrase\r\nwhich, from female lips, does not always exclude _malice prepense_,—or\r\nwhether it was from a conformity of taste, that Miss Cecilia more than\r\nonce crossed Edward in his favourite walks through Waverley-Chase. He\r\nhad not as yet assumed courage to accost her on these occasions; but\r\nthe meeting was not without its effect. A romantic lover is a strange\r\nidolater, who sometimes cares not out of what log he frames the object\r\nof his adoration; at least, if nature has given that object any\r\npassable proportion of personal charms, he can easily play the Jeweller\r\nand Dervise in the Oriental tale,[*] and supply her richly, out of the\r\nstores of his own imagination, with supernatural beauty, and all the\r\nproperties of intellectual wealth.\r\n\r\n[* See Hoppner’s tale of The Seven Lovers.]\r\n\r\n\r\nBut ere the charms of Miss Cecilia Stubbs had erected her into a\r\npositive goddess, or elevated her at least to a level with the saint\r\nher namesake, Mrs. Rachel Waverley gained some intimation which\r\ndetermined her to prevent the approaching apotheosis. Even the most\r\nsimple and unsuspicious of the female sex have (God bless them!) an\r\ninstinctive sharpness of perception in such matters, which sometimes\r\ngoes the length of observing partialities that never existed, but\r\nrarely misses to detect such as pass actually under their observation.\r\nMrs. Rachel applied herself with great prudence, not to combat, but to\r\nelude, the approaching danger, and suggested to her brother the\r\nnecessity that the heir of his house should see something more of the\r\nworld than was consistent with constant residence at Waverley-Honour.\r\n\r\nSir Everard would not at first listen to a proposal which went to\r\nseparate his nephew from him. Edward was a little bookish, he admitted,\r\nbut youth, he had always heard, was the season for learning, and, no\r\ndoubt, when his rage for letters was abated, and his head fully stocked\r\nwith knowledge, his nephew would take to field-sports and country\r\nbusiness. He had often, he said, himself regretted that he had not\r\nspent some time in study during his youth: he would neither have shot\r\nnor hunted with less skill, and he might have made the roof of Saint\r\nStephen’s echo to longer orations than were comprised in those zealous\r\nNoes, with which, when a member of the House during Godolphin’s\r\nadministration, he encountered every measure of government.\r\n\r\nAunt Rachel’s anxiety, however, lent her address to carry her point.\r\nEvery representative of their house had visited foreign parts, or\r\nserved his country in the army, before he settled for life at\r\nWaverley-Honour, and she appealed for the truth of her assertion to the\r\ngenealogical pedigree, an authority which Sir Everard was never known\r\nto contradict. In short, a proposal was made to Mr. Richard Waverley,\r\nthat his son should travel, under the direction of his present tutor\r\nMr. Pembroke, with a suitable allowance from the Baronet’s liberality.\r\nThe father himself saw no objection to this overture; but upon\r\nmentioning it casually at the table of the minister, the great man\r\nlooked grave. The reason was explained in private. The unhappy turn of\r\nSir Everard’s politics, the minister observed, was such as would render\r\nit highly improper that a young gentleman of such hopeful prospects\r\nshould travel on the Continent with a tutor, doubtless of his uncle’s\r\nchoosing, and directing his course by his instructions. What might Mr.\r\nEdward Waverley’s society be at Paris, what at Rome, where all manner\r\nof snares were spread by the Pretender and his sons—these were points\r\nfor Mr. Waverley to consider. This he could himself say, that he knew\r\nhis Majesty had such a just sense of Mr. Richard Waverley’s merits,\r\nthat, if his son adopted the army for a few years, a troop, he\r\nbelieved, might be reckoned upon in one of the dragoon regiments lately\r\nreturned from Flanders.\r\n\r\nA hint thus conveyed and enforced was not to be neglected with\r\nimpunity; and Richard Waverley, though with great dread of shocking his\r\nbrother’s prejudices, deemed he could not avoid accepting the\r\ncommission thus offered him for his son. The truth is, he calculated\r\nmuch, and justly, upon Sir Everard’s fondness for Edward, which made\r\nhim unlikely to resent any step that he might take in due submission to\r\nparental authority. Two letters announced this determination to the\r\nBaronet and his nephew. The latter barely communicated the fact, and\r\npointed out the necessary preparations for joining his regiment. To his\r\nbrother, Richard was more diffuse and circuitous. He coincided with\r\nhim, in the most flattering manner, in the propriety of his son’s\r\nseeing a little more of the world, and was even humble in expressions\r\nof gratitude for his proposed assistance; was, however, deeply\r\nconcerned that it was now, unfortunately, not in Edward’s power exactly\r\nto comply with the plan which had been chalked out by his best friend\r\nand benefactor. He himself had thought with pain on the boy’s\r\ninactivity, at an age when all his ancestors had borne arms; even\r\nRoyalty itself had deigned to inquire whether young Waverley was not\r\nnow in Flanders, at an age when his grandfather was already bleeding\r\nfor his king in the Great Civil War. This was accompanied by an offer\r\nof a troop of horse. What could he do? There was no time to consult his\r\nbrother’s inclinations, even if he could have conceived there might be\r\nobjections on his part to his nephew’s following the glorious career of\r\nhis predecessors. And, in short, that Edward was now (the intermediate\r\nsteps of cornet and lieutenant being overleapt with great agility)\r\nCaptain Waverley, of Gardiner’s regiment of dragoons, which he must\r\njoin in their quarters at Dundee in Scotland, in the course of a month.\r\n\r\nSir Everard Waverley received this intimation with a mixture of\r\nfeelings. At the period of the Hanoverian succession he had withdrawn\r\nfrom parliament, and his conduct in the memorable year 1715 had not\r\nbeen altogether unsuspected. There were reports of private musters of\r\ntenants and horses in Waverley-Chase by moonlight, and of cases of\r\ncarbines and pistols purchased in Holland, and addressed to the\r\nBaronet, but intercepted by the vigilance of a riding officer of the\r\nexcise, who was afterwards tossed in a blanket on a moonless night, by\r\nan association of stout yeomen, for his officiousness. Nay, it was even\r\nsaid, that at the arrest of Sir William Wyndham, the leader of the Tory\r\nparty, a letter from Sir Everard was found in the pocket of his\r\nnight-gown. But there was no overt act which an attainder could be\r\nfounded on, and government, contented with suppressing the insurrection\r\nof 1715, felt it neither prudent nor safe to push their vengeance\r\nfarther than against those unfortunate gentlemen who actually took up\r\narms.\r\n\r\nNor did Sir Everard’s apprehensions of personal consequences seem to\r\ncorrespond with the reports spread among his Whig neighbours. It was\r\nwell known that he had supplied with money several of the distressed\r\nNorthumbrians and Scotchmen, who, after being made prisoners at Preston\r\nin Lancashire, were imprisoned in Newgate and the Marshalsea, and it\r\nwas his solicitor and ordinary counsel who conducted the defence of\r\nsome of these unfortunate gentlemen at their trial. It was generally\r\nsupposed, however, that, had ministers possessed any real proof of Sir\r\nEverard’s accession to the rebellion, he either would not have ventured\r\nthus to brave the existing government, or at least would not have done\r\nso with impunity. The feelings which then dictated his proceedings were\r\nthose of a young man, and at an agitating period. Since that time Sir\r\nEverard’s Jacobitism had been gradually decaying, like a fire which\r\nburns out for want of fuel. His Tory and High-Church principles were\r\nkept up by some occasional exercise at elections and quarter-sessions;\r\nbut those respecting hereditary right were fallen into a sort of\r\nabeyance. Yet it jarred severely upon his feelings, that his nephew\r\nshould go into the army under the Brunswick dynasty; and the more so,\r\nas, independent of his high and conscientious ideas of paternal\r\nauthority, it was impossible, or at least highly imprudent, to\r\ninterfere authoritatively to prevent it. This suppressed vexation gave\r\nrise to many poohs and pshaws which were placed to the account of an\r\nincipient fit of gout, until, having sent for the Army List, the worthy\r\nBaronet consoled himself with reckoning the descendants of the houses\r\nof genuine loyalty, Mordaunts, Granvilles, and Stanleys, whose names\r\nwere to be found in that military record; and, calling up all his\r\nfeelings of family grandeur and warlike glory, he concluded, with logic\r\nsomething like Falstaff’s, that when war was at hand, although it were\r\nshame to be on any side but one, it were worse shame to be idle than to\r\nbe on the worst side, though blacker than usurpation could make it. As\r\nfor Aunt Rachel, her scheme had not exactly terminated according to her\r\nwishes, but she was under the necessity of submitting to circumstances;\r\nand her mortification was diverted by the employment she found in\r\nfitting out her nephew for the campaign, and greatly consoled by the\r\nprospect of beholding him blaze in complete uniform.\r\n\r\nEdward Waverley himself received with animated and undefined surprise\r\nthis most unexpected intelligence. It was, as a fine old poem expresses\r\nit, “like a fire to heather set,” that covers a solitary hill with\r\nsmoke, and illumines it at the same time with dusky fire. His tutor,\r\nor, I should say, Mr. Pembroke, for he scarce assumed the name of\r\ntutor, picked up about Edward’s room some fragments of irregular verse,\r\nwhich he appeared to have composed under the influence of the agitating\r\nfeelings occasioned by this sudden page being turned up to him in the\r\nbook of life. The doctor, who was a believer in all poetry which was\r\ncomposed by his friends, and written out in fair straight lines, with a\r\ncapital at the beginning of each, communicated this treasure to Aunt\r\nRachel, who, with her spectacles dimmed with tears, transferred them to\r\nher commonplace book, among choice receipts for cookery and medicine,\r\nfavourite texts, and portions from High-Church divines, and a few\r\nsongs, amatory and Jacobitical, which she had carolled in her younger\r\ndays, from whence her nephew’s poetical _tentamina_ were extracted when\r\nthe volume itself, with other authentic records of the Waverley family,\r\nwere exposed to the inspection of the unworthy editor of this memorable\r\nhistory. If they afford the reader no higher amusement, they will\r\nserve, at least, better than narrative of any kind, to acquaint him\r\nwith the wild and irregular spirit of our hero:—\r\n\r\nLate, when the Autumn evening fell\r\nOn Mirkwood-Mere’s romantic dell,\r\nThe lake return’d, in chasten’d gleam,\r\nThe purple cloud, the golden beam:\r\nReflected in the crystal pool,\r\nHeadland and bank lay fair and cool;\r\nThe weather-tinted rock and tower\r\nEach drooping tree, each fairy flower,\r\nSo true, so soft, the mirror gave,\r\nAs if there lay beneath the wave,\r\nSecure from trouble, toil, and care,\r\nA world than earthly world more fair.\r\n\r\nBut distant winds began to wake,\r\nAnd roused the Genius of the Lake!\r\nHe heard the groaning of the oak,\r\nAnd donn’d at once his sable cloak,\r\nAs warrior, at the battle-cry,\r\nInvests him with his panoply:\r\nThen, as the whirlwind nearer press’d\r\nHe ’gan to shake his foamy crest\r\nO’er furrow’d brow and blacken’d cheek,\r\nAnd bade his surge in thunder speak.\r\nIn wild and broken eddies whirl’d.\r\nFlitted that fond ideal world,\r\nAnd to the shore in tumult tost\r\nThe realms of fairy bliss were lost.\r\n\r\nYet, with a stern delight and strange,\r\nI saw the spirit-stirring change,\r\nAs warr’d the wind with wave and wood,\r\nUpon the ruin’d tower I stood,\r\nAnd felt my heart more strongly bound,\r\nResponsive to the lofty sound,\r\nWhile, joying in the mighty roar,\r\nI mourn’d that tranquil scene no more.\r\n\r\nSo, on the idle dreams of youth,\r\nBreaks the loud trumpet-call of truth,\r\nBids each fair vision pass away,\r\nLike landscape on the lake that lay,\r\nAs fair, as flitting, and as frail,\r\nAs that which fled the Autumn gale.—\r\nFor ever dead to fancy’s eye\r\nBe each gay form that glided by,\r\nWhile dreams of love and lady’s charms\r\nGive place to honour and to arms!\r\n\r\n\r\nIn sober prose, as perhaps these verses intimate less decidedly, the\r\ntransient idea of Miss Cecilia Stubbs passed from Captain Waverley’s\r\nheart amid the turmoil which his new destinies excited. She appeared,\r\nindeed, in full splendour in her father’s pew upon the Sunday when he\r\nattended service for the last time at the old parish church, upon which\r\noccasion, at the request of his uncle and Aunt Rachel, he was induced\r\n(nothing both, if the truth must be told) to present himself in full\r\nuniform.\r\n\r\nThere is no better antidote against entertaining too high an opinion of\r\nothers than having an excellent one of ourselves at the very same time.\r\nMiss Stubbs had indeed summoned up every assistance which art could\r\nafford to beauty; but, alas! hoop, patches, frizzled locks, and a new\r\nmantua of genuine French silk, were lost upon a young officer of\r\ndragoons who wore for the first time his gold-laced hat, jack-boots,\r\nand broadsword. I know not whether, like the champion of an old\r\nballad,—\r\n\r\nHis heart was all on honour bent,\r\n    He could not stoop to love;\r\nNo lady in the land had power\r\n    His frozen heart to move;\r\n\r\n\r\nor whether the deep and flaming bars of embroidered gold, which now\r\nfenced his breast, defied the artillery of Cecilia’s eyes; but every\r\narrow was launched at him in vain.\r\n\r\nYet did I mark where Cupid’s shaft did light;\r\nIt lighted not on little western flower,\r\nBut on bold yeoman, flower of all the west,\r\nHight Jonas Culbertfield, the steward’s son.\r\n\r\n\r\nCraving pardon for my heroics (which I am unable in certain cases to\r\nresist giving way to), it is a melancholy fact, that my history must\r\nhere take leave of the fair Cecilia, who, like many a daughter of Eve,\r\nafter the departure of Edward, and the dissipation of certain idle\r\nvisions which she had adopted, quietly contented herself with a\r\n_pis-aller_, and gave her hand, at the distance of six months, to the\r\naforesaid Jonas, son of the Baronet’s steward, and heir (no unfertile\r\nprospect) to a steward’s fortune, besides the snug probability of\r\nsucceeding to his father’s office. All these advantages moved Squire\r\nStubbs, as much as the ruddy brown and manly form of the suitor\r\ninfluenced his daughter, to abate somewhat in the article of their\r\ngentry; and so the match was concluded. None seemed more gratified than\r\nAunt Rachel, who had hitherto looked rather askance upon the\r\npresumptuous damsel (as much so, peradventure, as her nature would\r\npermit), but who, on the first appearance of the new-married pair at\r\nchurch, honoured the bride with a smile and a profound curtsy, in\r\npresence of the rector, the curate, the clerk, and the whole\r\ncongregation of the united parishes of Waverley _cum_ Beverley.\r\n\r\nI beg pardon, once and for all, of those readers who take up novels\r\nmerely for amusement, for plaguing them so long with old-fashioned\r\npolitics, and Whig and Tory, and Hanoverians and Jacobites. The truth\r\nis, I cannot promise them that this story shall be intelligible, not to\r\nsay probable, without it. My plan requires that I should explain the\r\nmotives on which its action proceeded; and these motives necessarily\r\narose from the feelings, prejudices, and parties of the times. I do not\r\ninvite my fair readers, whose sex and impatience give them the greatest\r\nright to complain of these circumstances, into a flying chariot drawn\r\nby hippogriffs, or moved by enchantment. Mine is a humble English\r\npost-chaise, drawn upon four wheels, and keeping his Majesty’s highway.\r\nSuch as dislike the vehicle may leave it at the next halt, and wait for\r\nthe conveyance of Prince Hussein’s tapestry, or Malek the Weaver’s\r\nflying sentrybox. Those who are contented to remain with me will be\r\noccasionally exposed to the dulness inseparable from heavy roads, steep\r\nhills, sloughs, and other terrestrial retardations; but with tolerable\r\nhorses and a civil driver (as the advertisements have it), I engage to\r\nget as soon as possible into a more picturesque and romantic country,\r\nif my passengers incline to have some patience with me during my first\r\nstages.[*]\r\n\r\n[* These Introductory Chapters have been a good deal censured as\r\ntedious and unnecessary. Yet there are circumstances recorded in them\r\nwhich the author has not been able to persuade himself to retrench or\r\ncancel.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VI.\r\nTHE ADIEUS OF WAVERLEY\r\n\r\n\r\nIt was upon the evening of this memorable Sunday that Sir Everard\r\nentered the library, where he narrowly missed surprising our young hero\r\nas he went through the guards of the broadsword with the ancient weapon\r\nof old Sir Hildebrand, which, being preserved as an heirloom, usually\r\nhung over the chimney in the library, beneath a picture of the knight\r\nand his horse, where the features were almost entirely hidden by the\r\nknight’s profusion of curled hair, and the Bucephalus which he bestrode\r\nconcealed by the voluminous robes of the Bath with which he was\r\ndecorated. Sir Everard entered, and after a glance at the picture and\r\nanother at his nephew, began a little speech, which, however, soon\r\ndropt into the natural simplicity of his common manner, agitated upon\r\nthe present occasion by no common feeling. “Nephew,” he said; and then,\r\nas mending his phrase, “My dear Edward, it is God’s will, and also the\r\nwill of your father, whom, under God, it is your duty to obey, that you\r\nshould leave us to take up the profession of arms, in which so many of\r\nyour ancestors have been distinguished. I have made such arrangements\r\nas will enable you to take the field as their descendant, and as the\r\nprobable heir of the house of Waverley; and, sir, in the field of\r\nbattle you will remember what name you bear. And, Edward, my dear boy,\r\nremember also that you are the last of that race, and the only hope of\r\nits revival depends upon you; therefore, as far as duty and honour will\r\npermit, avoid danger—I mean unnecessary danger—and keep no company with\r\nrakes, gamblers, and Whigs, of whom, it is to be feared, there are but\r\ntoo many in the service into which you are going. Your colonel, as I am\r\ninformed, is an excellent man—for a Presbyterian; but you will remember\r\nyour duty to God, the Church of England, and the—” (this breach ought\r\nto have been supplied, according to the rubric, with the word “king;”\r\nbut as, unfortunately, that word conveyed a double and embarrassing\r\nsense, one meaning _de facto_ and the other _de jure_, the knight\r\nfilled up the blank otherwise)—“the Church of England, and all\r\nconstituted authorities.” Then, not trusting himself with any further\r\noratory, he carried his nephew to his stables to see the horses\r\ndestined for his campaign. Two were black (the regimental colour),\r\nsuperb chargers both; the other three were stout active hacks, designed\r\nfor the road, or for his domestics, of whom two were to attend him from\r\nthe Hall; an additional groom, if necessary, might be picked up in\r\nScotland.\r\n\r\n“You will depart with but a small retinue,” quoth the Baronet,\r\n“compared to Sir Hildebrand, when he mustered before the gate of the\r\nHall a larger body of horse than your whole regiment consists of. I\r\ncould have wished that these twenty young fellows from my estate, who\r\nhave enlisted in your troop, had been to march with you on your journey\r\nto Scotland. It would have been something, at least; but I am told\r\ntheir attendance would be thought unusual in these days, when every new\r\nand foolish fashion is introduced to break the natural dependence of\r\nthe people upon their landlords.”\r\n\r\nSir Everard had done his best to correct this unnatural disposition of\r\nthe times; for he had brightened the chain of attachment between the\r\nrecruits and their young captain, not only by a copious repast of beef\r\nand ale, by way of parting feast, but by such a pecuniary donation to\r\neach individual as tended rather to improve the conviviality than the\r\ndiscipline of their march. After inspecting the cavalry, Sir Everard\r\nagain conducted his nephew to the library, where he produced a letter,\r\ncarefully folded, surrounded by a little stripe of flox-silk, according\r\nto ancient form, and sealed with an accurate impression of the Waverley\r\ncoat-of-arms. It was addressed, with great formality, “To Cosmo Comyne\r\nBradwardine, Esq., of Bradwardine, at his principal mansion of\r\nTully-Veolan, in Perthshire, North Britain. These—By the hands of\r\nCaptain Edward Waverley, nephew of Sir Everard Waverley, of\r\nWaverley-Honour, Bart.”\r\n\r\nThe gentleman to whom this enormous greeting was addressed, of whom we\r\nshall have more to say in the sequel, had been in arms for the exiled\r\nfamily of Stuart in the year 1715, and was made prisoner at Preston in\r\nLancashire. He was of a very ancient family, and somewhat embarrassed\r\nfortune; a scholar, according to the scholarship of Scotchmen, that is,\r\nhis learning was more diffuse than accurate, and he was rather a reader\r\nthan a grammarian. Of his zeal for the classic authors he is said to\r\nhave given an uncommon instance. On the road between Preston and\r\nLondon, he made his escape from his guards; but being afterwards found\r\nloitering near the place where they had lodged the former night, he was\r\nrecognised, and again arrested. His companions, and even his escort,\r\nwere surprised at his infatuation, and could not help inquiring, why,\r\nbeing once at liberty, he had not made the best of his way to a place\r\nof safety; to which he replied, that he had intended to do so, but, in\r\ngood faith, he had returned to seek his Titus Livius, which he had\r\nforgot in the hurry of his escape.[3] The simplicity of this anecdote\r\nstruck the gentleman, who, as we before observed, had managed the\r\ndefence of some of those unfortunate persons, at the expense of Sir\r\nEverard, and perhaps some others of the party. He was, besides, himself\r\na special admirer of the old Patavinian, and though probably his own\r\nzeal might not have carried him such extravagant lengths, even to\r\nrecover the edition of Sweynheim and Pannartz (supposed to be the\r\n_princeps_), he did not the less estimate the devotion of the North\r\nBriton, and in consequence exerted himself to so much purpose to remove\r\nand soften evidence, detect legal flaws, _et cetera_, that he\r\naccomplished the final discharge and deliverance of Cosmo Comyne\r\nBradwardine from certain very awkward consequences of a plea before our\r\nsovereign lord the king in Westminster.\r\n\r\nThe Baron of Bradwardine, for he was generally so called in Scotland\r\n(although his intimates, from his place of residence, used to\r\ndenominate him Tully-Veolan, or more familiarly, Tully), no sooner\r\nstood _rectus in curia_ than he posted down to pay his respects and\r\nmake his acknowledgments at Waverley-Honour. A congenial passion for\r\nfield-sports, and a general coincidence in political opinions, cemented\r\nhis friendship with Sir Everard, notwithstanding the difference of\r\ntheir habits and studies in other particulars; and, having spent\r\nseveral weeks at Waverley-Honour, the Baron departed with many\r\nexpressions of regard, warmly pressing the Baronet to return his visit,\r\nand partake of the diversion of grouse-shooting, upon his moors in\r\nPerthshire next season. Shortly after, Mr. Bradwardine remitted from\r\nScotland a sum in reimbursement of expenses incurred in the King’s High\r\nCourt of Westminster, which, although not quite so formidable when\r\nreduced to the English denomination, had, in its original form of\r\nScotch pounds, shillings, and pence, such a formidable effect upon the\r\nframe of Duncan Macwheeble, the laird’s confidential factor,\r\nbaron-bailie, and man of resource, that he had a fit of the cholic,\r\nwhich lasted for five days, occasioned, he said, solely and utterly by\r\nbecoming the unhappy instrument of conveying such a serious sum of\r\nmoney out of his native country into the hands of the false English.\r\nBut patriotism, as it is the fairest, so it is often the most\r\nsuspicious mask of other feelings; and many who knew Bailie Macwheeble\r\nconcluded that his professions of regret were not altogether\r\ndisinterested, and that he would have grudged the moneys paid to the\r\n_loons_ at Westminster much less had they not come from Bradwardine\r\nestate, a fund which he considered as more particularly his own. But\r\nthe Bailie protested he was absolutely disinterested—\r\n\r\n“Woe, woe, for Scotland, not a whit for me!”\r\n\r\n\r\nThe laird was only rejoiced that his worthy friend, Sir Everard\r\nWaverley of Waverley-Honour, was reimbursed of the expenditure which he\r\nhad outlaid on account of the house of Bradwardine. It concerned, he\r\nsaid, the credit of his own family, and of the kingdom of Scotland at\r\nlarge, that these disbursements should be repaid forthwith, and, if\r\ndelayed, it would be a matter of national reproach. Sir Everard,\r\naccustomed to treat much larger sums with indifference, received the\r\nremittance of £294, 13_s_. 6_d_. without being aware that the payment\r\nwas an international concern, and, indeed, would probably have forgot\r\nthe circumstance altogether, if Bailie Macwheeble had thought of\r\ncomforting his cholic by intercepting the subsidy. A yearly intercourse\r\ntook place, of a short letter and a hamper or a cask or two, between\r\nWaverley-Honour and Tully-Veolan, the English exports consisting of\r\nmighty cheeses and mightier ale, pheasants, and venison, and the\r\nScottish returns being vested in grouse, white hares, pickled salmon,\r\nand usquebaugh; all which were meant, sent, and received as pledges of\r\nconstant friendship and amity between two important houses. It followed\r\nas a matter of course, that the heir-apparent of Waverley-Honour could\r\nnot with propriety visit Scotland without being furnished with\r\ncredentials to the Baron of Bradwardine.\r\n\r\nWhen this matter was explained and settled, Mr. Pembroke expressed his\r\nwish to take a private and particular leave of his dear pupil. The good\r\nman’s exhortations to Edward to preserve an unblemished life and\r\nmorals, to hold fast the principles of the Christian religion, and to\r\neschew the profane company of scoffers and latitudinarians, too much\r\nabounding in the army, were not unmingled with his political\r\nprejudices. It had pleased Heaven, he said, to place Scotland\r\n(doubtless for the sins of their ancestors in 1642) in a more\r\ndeplorable state of darkness than even this unhappy kingdom of England.\r\nHere, at least, although the candlestick of the Church of England had\r\nbeen in some degree removed from its place, it yet afforded a\r\nglimmering light; there was a hierarchy, though schismatical, and\r\nfallen from the principles maintained by those great fathers of the\r\nchurch, Sancroft and his brethren; there was a liturgy, though woefully\r\nperverted in some of the principal petitions. But in Scotland it was\r\nutter darkness; and, excepting a sorrowful, scattered, and persecuted\r\nremnant, the pulpits were abandoned to Presbyterians, and, he feared,\r\nto sectaries of every description. It should be his duty to fortify his\r\ndear pupil to resist such unhallowed and pernicious doctrines in church\r\nand state as must necessarily be forced at times upon his unwilling\r\nears.\r\n\r\nHere he produced two immense folded packets, which appeared each to\r\ncontain a whole ream of closely written manuscript. They had been the\r\nlabour of the worthy man’s whole life; and never were labour and zeal\r\nmore absurdly wasted. He had at one time gone to London, with the\r\nintention of giving them to the world, by the medium of a bookseller in\r\nLittle Britain, well known to deal in such commodities, and to whom he\r\nwas instructed to address himself in a particular phrase and with a\r\ncertain sign, which, it seems, passed at that time current among the\r\ninitiated Jacobites. The moment Mr. Pembroke had uttered the\r\nShibboleth, with the appropriate gesture, the bibliopolist greeted him,\r\nnotwithstanding every disclamation, by the title of Doctor, and\r\nconveying him into his back shop, after inspecting every possible and\r\nimpossible place of concealment, he commenced: “Eh, Doctor!—Well—all\r\nunder the rose—snug—I keep no holes here even for a Hanoverian rat to\r\nhide in. And, what—eh! any good news from our friends over the\r\nwater?—and how does the worthy King of France?—Or perhaps you are more\r\nlately from Rome? it must be Rome will do it at last—the church must\r\nlight its candle at the old lamp.—Eh—what, cautious? I like you the\r\nbetter; but no fear.”\r\n\r\nHere Mr. Pembroke with some difficulty stopt a torrent of\r\ninterrogations, eked out with signs, nods, and winks; and, having at\r\nlength convinced the bookseller that he did him too much honour in\r\nsupposing him an emissary of exiled royalty, he explained his actual\r\nbusiness.\r\n\r\nThe man of books with a much more composed air proceeded to examine the\r\nmanuscripts. The title of the first was “A Dissent from Dissenters, or\r\nthe Comprehension confuted; showing the Impossibility of any\r\nComposition between the Church and Puritans, Presbyterians, or\r\nSectaries of any Description; illustrated from the Scriptures, the\r\nFathers of the Church, and the soundest Controversial Divines.” To this\r\nwork the bookseller positively demurred. “Well meant,” he said, “and\r\nlearned, doubtless;” but the time had gone by. Printed on small-pica it\r\nwould run to eight hundred pages, and could never pay. Begged therefore\r\nto be excused. Loved and honoured the true church from his soul, and,\r\nhad it been a sermon on the martyrdom, or any twelve-penny touch—“why,\r\nI would venture something for the honour of the cloth. But come, let’s\r\nsee the other. ‘Right Hereditary righted!’—Ah! there’s some sense in\r\nthis. Hum—hum—hum—pages so many, paper so much, letter-press—Ah—I’ll\r\ntell you, though, Doctor, you must knock out some of the Latin and\r\nGreek; heavy, Doctor, damn’d heavy—(beg your pardon) and if you throw\r\nin a few grains more pepper—I am he that never preached my author. I\r\nhave published for Drake and Charlwood Lawton, and poor Amhurst.[4] Ah,\r\nCaleb! Caleb! Well, it was a shame to let poor Caleb starve, and so\r\nmany fat rectors and squires among us. I gave him a dinner once a week;\r\nbut, Lord love you, what’s once a week, when a man does not know where\r\nto go the other six days? Well, but I must show the manuscript to\r\nlittle Tom Alibi the solicitor, who manages all my law affairs—must\r\nkeep on the windy side; the mob were very uncivil the last time I\r\nmounted in Old Palace Yard—all Whigs and Roundheads every man of them,\r\nWilliamites and Hanover rats.”\r\n\r\nThe next day Mr. Pembroke again called on the publisher, but found Tom\r\nAlibi’s advice had determined him against undertaking the work. “Not\r\nbut what I would go to—(what was I going to say?) to the Plantations\r\nfor the church with pleasure—but, dear Doctor, I have a wife and\r\nfamily; but, to show my zeal, I’ll recommend the job to my neighbour\r\nTrimmel—he is a bachelor, and leaving off business, so a voyage in a\r\nwestern barge would not inconvenience him.” But Mr. Trimmel was also\r\nobdurate, and Mr. Pembroke, fortunately perchance for himself, was\r\ncompelled to return to Waverley-Honour with his treatise in vindication\r\nof the real fundamental principles of church and state safely packed in\r\nhis saddle-bags.\r\n\r\nAs the public were thus likely to be deprived of the benefit arising\r\nfrom his lucubrations by the selfish cowardice of the trade, Mr.\r\nPembroke resolved to make two copies of these tremendous manuscripts\r\nfor the use of his pupil. He felt that he had been indolent as a tutor,\r\nand, besides, his conscience checked him for complying with the request\r\nof Mr. Richard Waverley, that he would impress no sentiments upon\r\nEdward’s mind inconsistent with the present settlement in church and\r\nstate. But now, thought he, I may, without breach of my word, since he\r\nis no longer under my tuition, afford the youth the means of judging\r\nfor himself, and have only to dread his reproaches for so long\r\nconcealing the light which the perusal will flash upon his mind. While\r\nhe thus indulged the reveries of an author and a politician, his\r\ndarling proselyte, seeing nothing very inviting in the title of the\r\ntracts, and appalled by the bulk and compact lines of the manuscript,\r\nquietly consigned them to a corner of his travelling trunk.\r\n\r\nAunt Rachel’s farewell was brief and affectionate. She only cautioned\r\nher dear Edward, whom she probably deemed somewhat susceptible, against\r\nthe fascination of Scottish beauty. She allowed that the northern part\r\nof the island contained some ancient families, but they were all Whigs\r\nand Presbyterians except the Highlanders; and respecting them she must\r\nneeds say, there could be no great delicacy among the ladies, where the\r\ngentlemen’s usual attire was, as she had been assured, to say the\r\nleast, very singular, and not at all decorous. She concluded her\r\nfarewell with a kind and moving benediction, and gave the young\r\nofficer, as a pledge of her regard, a valuable diamond ring (often worn\r\nby the male sex at that time), and a purse of broad gold-pieces, which\r\nalso were more common Sixty Years Since than they have been of late.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VII.\r\nA HORSE-QUARTER IN SCOTLAND\r\n\r\n\r\nThe next morning, amid varied feelings, the chief of which was a\r\npredominant, anxious, and even solemn impression, that he was now in a\r\ngreat measure abandoned to his own guidance and direction, Edward\r\nWaverley departed from the Hall amid the blessings and tears of all the\r\nold domestics and the inhabitants of the village, mingled with some sly\r\npetitions for sergeantcies and corporalships, and so forth, on the part\r\nof those who professed that “they never thoft to ha’ seen Jacob, and\r\nGiles, and Jonathan go off for soldiers, save to attend his honour, as\r\nin duty bound.” Edward, as in duty bound, extricated himself from the\r\nsupplicants with the pledge of fewer promises than might have been\r\nexpected from a young man so little accustomed to the world. After a\r\nshort visit to London, he proceeded on horseback, then the general mode\r\nof travelling, to Edinburgh, and from thence to Dundee, a seaport on\r\nthe eastern coast of Angus-shire, where his regiment was then\r\nquartered.\r\n\r\nHe now entered upon a new world, where, for a time, all was beautiful\r\nbecause all was new. Colonel Gardiner, the commanding officer of the\r\nregiment, was himself a study for a romantic, and at the same time an\r\ninquisitive youth. In person he was tall, handsome, and active, though\r\nsomewhat advanced in life. In his early years he had been what is\r\ncalled, by manner of palliative, a very gay young man, and strange\r\nstories were circulated about his sudden conversion from doubt, if not\r\ninfidelity, to a serious and even enthusiastic turn of mind. It was\r\nwhispered that a supernatural communication, of a nature obvious even\r\nto the exterior senses, had produced this wonderful change; and though\r\nsome mentioned the proselyte as an enthusiast, none hinted at his being\r\na hypocrite. This singular and mystical circumstance gave Colonel\r\nGardiner a peculiar and solemn interest in the eyes of the young\r\nsoldier.[5] It may be easily imagined that the officers, of a regiment\r\ncommanded by so respectable a person composed a society more sedate and\r\norderly than a military mess always exhibits; and that Waverley escaped\r\nsome temptations to which he might otherwise have been exposed.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile his military education proceeded. Already a good horseman, he\r\nwas now initiated into the arts of the manege, which, when carried to\r\nperfection, almost realise the fable of the Centaur, the guidance of\r\nthe horse appearing to proceed from the rider’s mere volition, rather\r\nthan from the use of any external and apparent signal of motion. He\r\nreceived also instructions in his field duty; but I must own, that when\r\nhis first ardour was past, his progress fell short in the latter\r\nparticular of what he wished and expected. The duty of an officer, the\r\nmost imposing of all others to the inexperienced mind, because\r\naccompanied with so much outward pomp and circumstance, is in its\r\nessence a very dry and abstract task, depending chiefly upon\r\narithmetical combinations, requiring much attention, and a cool and\r\nreasoning head to bring them into action. Our hero was liable to fits\r\nof absence, in which his blunders excited some mirth, and called down\r\nsome reproof. This circumstance impressed him with a painful sense of\r\ninferiority in those qualities which appeared most to deserve and\r\nobtain regard in his new profession. He asked himself in vain, why his\r\neye could not judge of distance or space so well as those of his\r\ncompanions; why his head was not always successful in disentangling the\r\nvarious partial movements necessary to execute a particular evolution;\r\nand why his memory, so alert upon most occasions, did not correctly\r\nretain technical phrases and minute points of etiquette or field\r\ndiscipline. Waverley was naturally modest, and therefore did not fall\r\ninto the egregious mistake of supposing such minuter rules of military\r\nduty beneath his notice, or conceiting himself to be born a general,\r\nbecause he made an indifferent subaltern. The truth was, that the vague\r\nand unsatisfactory course of reading which he had pursued, working upon\r\na temper naturally retired and abstracted, had given him that wavering\r\nand unsettled habit of mind which is most averse to study and riveted\r\nattention. Time, in the mean while, hung heavy on his hands. The gentry\r\nof the neighbourhood were disaffected, and showed little hospitality to\r\nthe military guests; and the people of the town, chiefly engaged in\r\nmercantile pursuits, were not such as Waverley chose to associate with.\r\nThe arrival of summer, and a curiosity to know something more of\r\nScotland than he could see in a ride from his quarters, determined him\r\nto request leave of absence for a few weeks. He resolved first to visit\r\nhis uncle’s ancient friend and correspondent, with the purpose of\r\nextending or shortening the time of his residence according to\r\ncircumstances. He travelled of course on horse-back, and with a single\r\nattendant, and passed his first night at a miserable inn, where the\r\nlandlady had neither shoes nor stockings, and the landlord, who called\r\nhimself a gentleman, was disposed to be rude to his guest, because he\r\nhad not bespoke the pleasure of his society to supper.[6] The next day,\r\ntraversing an open and uninclosed country, Edward gradually approached\r\nthe Highlands of Perthshire, which at first had appeared a blue outline\r\nin the horizon, but now swelled into huge gigantic masses, which\r\nfrowned defiance over the more level country that lay beneath them.\r\nNear the bottom of this stupendous barrier, but still in the Lowland\r\ncountry, dwelt Cosmo Comyne Bradwardine of Bradwardine; and, if\r\ngrey-haired eld can be in aught believed, there had dwelt his\r\nancestors, with all their heritage, since the days of the gracious King\r\nDuncan.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VIII.\r\nA SCOTTISH MANOR-HOUSE SIXTY YEARS SINCE\r\n\r\n\r\nIt was about noon when Captain Waverley entered the straggling village,\r\nor rather hamlet, of Tully-Veolan, close to which was situated the\r\nmansion of the proprietor. The houses seemed miserable in the extreme,\r\nespecially to an eye accustomed to the smiling neatness of English\r\ncottages. They stood, without any respect for regularity, on each side\r\nof a straggling kind of unpaved street, where children, almost in a\r\nprimitive state of nakedness, lay sprawling, as if to be crushed by the\r\nhoofs of the first passing horse. Occasionally, indeed, when such a\r\nconsummation seemed inevitable, a watchful old grandam, with her close\r\ncap, distaff, and spindle, rushed like a sibyl in frenzy out of one of\r\nthese miserable cells, dashed into the middle of the path, and\r\nsnatching up her own charge from among the sunburnt loiterers, saluted\r\nhim with a sound cuff, and transported him back to his dungeon, the\r\nlittle white-headed varlet screaming all the while, from the very top\r\nof his lungs, a shrilly treble to the growling remonstrances of the\r\nenraged matron. Another part in this concert was sustained by the\r\nincessant yelping of a score of idle useless curs, which followed,\r\nsnarling, barking, howling, and snapping at the horses’ heels; a\r\nnuisance at that time so common in Scotland, that a French tourist,\r\nwho, like other travellers, longed to find a good and rational reason\r\nfor everything he saw, has recorded, as one of the memorabilia of\r\nCaledonia, that the state maintained, in each village a relay of curs,\r\ncalled _collies_, whose duty it was to chase the _chevaux de poste_\r\n(too starved and exhausted to move without such a stimulus) from one\r\nhamlet to another, till their annoying convoy drove them to the end of\r\ntheir stage. The evil and remedy (such as it is) still exist. But this\r\nis remote from our present purpose, and is only thrown out for\r\nconsideration of the collectors under Mr. Dent’s Dog Bill.\r\n\r\nAs Waverley moved on, here and there an old man, bent as much by toil\r\nas years, his eyes bleared with age and smoke, tottered to the door of\r\nhis hut, to gaze on the dress of the stranger and the form and motions\r\nof the horses, and then assembled, with his neighbours, in a little\r\ngroup at the smithy, to discuss the probabilities of whence the\r\nstranger came and where he might be going. Three or four village girls,\r\nreturning from the well or brook with pitchers and pails upon their\r\nheads, formed more pleasing objects, and, with their thin short-gowns\r\nand single petticoats, bare arms, legs, and feet, uncovered heads and\r\nbraided hair, somewhat resembled Italian forms of landscape. Nor could\r\na lover of the picturesque have challenged either the elegance of their\r\ncostume or the symmetry of their shape; although, to say the truth, a\r\nmere Englishman in search of the “comfortable”,—a word peculiar to his\r\nnative tongue, might have wished the clothes less scanty, the feet and\r\nlegs somewhat protected from the weather, the head and complexion\r\nshrouded from the sun, or perhaps might even have thought the whole\r\nperson and dress considerably improved by a plentiful application of\r\nspring water, with a _quantum sufficit_ of soap. The whole scene was\r\ndepressing; for it argued, at the first glance, at least a stagnation\r\nof industry, and perhaps of intellect. Even curiosity, the busiest\r\npassion of the idle, seemed of a listless cast in the village of\r\nTully-Veolan: the curs aforesaid alone showed any part of its activity;\r\nwith the villagers it was passive. They stood, and gazed at the\r\nhandsome young officer and his attendant, but without any of those\r\nquick motions and eager looks that indicate the earnestness with which\r\nthose who live in monotonous ease at home look out for amusement\r\nabroad. Yet the physiognomy of the people, when more closely examined,\r\nwas far from exhibiting the indifference of stupidity; their features\r\nwere rough, but remarkably intelligent; grave, but the very reverse of\r\nstupid; and from among the young women an artist might have chosen more\r\nthan one model whose features and form resembled those of Minerva. The\r\nchildren also, whose skins were burnt black, and whose hair was\r\nbleached white, by the influence of the sun, had a look and manner of\r\nlife and interest. It seemed, upon the whole, as if poverty, and\r\nindolence, its too frequent companion, were combining to depress the\r\nnatural genius and acquired information of a hardy, intelligent, and\r\nreflecting peasantry.\r\n\r\nSome such thoughts crossed Waverley’s mind as he paced his horse slowly\r\nthrough the rugged and flinty street of Tully-Veolan, interrupted only\r\nin his meditations by the occasional caprioles which his charger\r\nexhibited at the reiterated assaults of those canine Cossacks, the\r\n_collies_ before mentioned. The village was more than half a mile long,\r\nthe cottages being irregularly divided from each other by gardens, or\r\nyards, as the inhabitants called them, of different sizes, where (for\r\nit is Sixty Years Since) the now universal potato was unknown, but\r\nwhich were stored with gigantic plants of _kale_ or colewort, encircled\r\nwith groves of nettles, and exhibited here and there a huge hemlock, or\r\nthe national thistle, overshadowing a quarter of the petty inclosure.\r\nThe broken ground on which the village was built had never been\r\nlevelled; so that these inclosures presented declivities of every\r\ndegree, here rising like terraces, there sinking like tan-pits. The\r\ndry-stone walls which fenced, or seemed to fence (for they were sorely\r\nbreached), these hanging gardens of Tully-Veolan were intersected by a\r\nnarrow lane leading to the common field, where the joint labour of the\r\nvillagers cultivated alternate ridges and patches of rye, oats, barley,\r\nand pease, each of such minute extent that at a little distance the\r\nunprofitable variety of the surface resembled a tailor’s book of\r\npatterns. In a few favoured instances, there appeared behind the\r\ncottages a miserable wigwam, compiled of earth, loose stones, and turf,\r\nwhere the wealthy might perhaps shelter a starved cow or sorely galled\r\nhorse. But almost every hut was fenced in front by a huge black stack\r\nof turf on one side of the door, while on the other the family dunghill\r\nascended in noble emulation.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Tully-Veolan]\r\n\r\nAbout a bowshot from the end of the village appeared the inclosures\r\nproudly denominated the Parks of Tully-Veolan, being certain square\r\nfields, surrounded and divided by stone walls five feet in height. In\r\nthe centre of the exterior barrier was the upper gate of the avenue,\r\nopening under an archway, battlemented on the top, and adorned with two\r\nlarge weather-beaten mutilated masses of upright stone, which, if the\r\ntradition of the hamlet could be trusted, had once represented, at\r\nleast had been once designed to represent, two rampant Bears, the\r\nsupporters of the family of Bradwardine. This avenue was straight and\r\nof moderate length, running between a double row of very ancient\r\nhorse-chestnuts, planted alternately with sycamores, which rose to such\r\nhuge height, and nourished so luxuriantly, that their boughs completely\r\nover-arched the broad road beneath. Beyond these venerable ranks, and\r\nrunning parallel to them, were two high walls, of apparently the like\r\nantiquity, overgrown with ivy, honeysuckle, and other climbing plants.\r\nThe avenue seemed very little trodden, and chiefly by foot-passengers;\r\nso that being very broad, and enjoying a constant shade, it was clothed\r\nwith grass of a deep and rich verdure, excepting where a foot-path,\r\nworn by occasional passengers, tracked with a natural sweep the way\r\nfrom the upper to the lower gate. This nether portal, like the former,\r\nopened in front of a wall ornamented with some rude sculpture, with\r\nbattlements on the top, over which were seen, half-hidden by the trees\r\nof the avenue, the high steep roofs and narrow gables of the mansion,\r\nwith lines indented into steps, and corners decorated with small\r\nturrets. One of the folding leaves of the lower gate was open, and as\r\nthe sun shone full into the court behind, a long line of brilliancy was\r\nflung upon the aperture up the dark and gloomy avenue. It was one of\r\nthose effects which a painter loves to represent, and mingled well with\r\nthe struggling light which found its way between the boughs of the\r\nshady arch that vaulted the broad green alley.\r\n\r\nThe solitude and repose of the whole scene seemed almost monastic; and\r\nWaverley, who had given his horse to his servant on entering the first\r\ngate, walked slowly down the avenue, enjoying the grateful and cooling\r\nshade, and so much pleased with the placid ideas of rest and seclusion\r\nexcited by this confined and quiet scene, that he forgot the misery and\r\ndirt of the hamlet he had left behind him. The opening into the paved\r\ncourt-yard corresponded with the rest of the scene. The house, which\r\nseemed to consist of two or three high, narrow, and steep-roofed\r\nbuildings, projecting from each other at right angles, formed one side\r\nof the inclosure. It had been built at a period when castles were no\r\nlonger necessary, and when the Scottish architects had not yet acquired\r\nthe art of designing a domestic residence. The windows were numberless,\r\nbut very small; the roof had some nondescript kind of projections,\r\ncalled bartizans, and displayed at each frequent angle a small turret,\r\nrather resembling a pepper-box than a Gothic watchtower. Neither did\r\nthe front indicate absolute security from danger. There were loop-holes\r\nfor musketry, and iron stanchions on the lower windows, probably to\r\nrepel any roving band of gypsies, or resist a predatory visit from the\r\ncaterans of the neighbouring Highlands. Stables and other offices\r\noccupied another side of the square. The former were low vaults, with\r\nnarrow slits instead of windows, resembling, as Edward’s groom\r\nobserved, “rather a prison for murderers, and larceners, and such like\r\nas are tried at ’sizes, than a place for any Christian cattle.” Above\r\nthese dungeon-looking stables were granaries, called girnels, and other\r\noffices, to which there was access by outside stairs of heavy masonry.\r\nTwo battlemented walls, one of which faced the avenue, and the other\r\ndivided the court from the garden, completed the inclosure.\r\n\r\nNor was the court without its ornaments. In one corner was a\r\ntun-bellied pigeon-house, of great size and rotundity, resembling in\r\nfigure and proportion the curious edifice called Arthur’s Oven, which\r\nwould have turned the brains of all the antiquaries in England, had not\r\nthe worthy proprietor pulled it down for the sake of mending a\r\nneighbouring dam-dyke. This dove-cot, or columbarium, as the owner\r\ncalled it, was no small resource to a Scottish laird of that period,\r\nwhose scanty rents were eked out by the contributions levied upon the\r\nfarms by these light foragers, and the conscriptions exacted from the\r\nlatter for the benefit of the table.\r\n\r\nAnother corner of the court displayed a fountain, where a huge bear,\r\ncarved in stone, predominated over a large stone-basin, into which he\r\ndisgorged the water. This work of art was the wonder of the country ten\r\nmiles round. It must not be forgotten, that all sorts of bears, small\r\nand large, demi or in full proportion, were carved over the windows,\r\nupon the ends of the gables, terminated the spouts, and supported the\r\nturrets, with the ancient family motto, =Bewar the Bar=, cut under each\r\nhyperborean form. The court was spacious, well paved, and perfectly\r\nclean, there being probably another entrance behind the stables for\r\nremoving the litter. Everything around appeared solitary, and would\r\nhave been silent, but for the continued plashing of the fountain; and\r\nthe whole scene still maintained the monastic illusion which the fancy\r\nof Waverley had conjured up. And here we beg permission to close a\r\nchapter of still life.[7]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IX.\r\nMORE OF THE MANOR-HOUSE AND ITS ENVIRONS\r\n\r\n\r\nAfter having satisfied his curiosity by gazing around him for a few\r\nminutes, Waverley applied himself to the massive knocker of the\r\nhall-door, the architrave of which bore the date 1594. But no answer\r\nwas returned, though the peal resounded through a number of apartments,\r\nand was echoed from the court-yard walls without the house, startling\r\nthe pigeons from the venerable rotunda which they occupied, and\r\nalarming anew even the distant village curs, which had retired to sleep\r\nupon their respective dunghills. Tired of the din which he created, and\r\nthe unprofitable responses which it excited, Waverley began to think\r\nthat he had reached the castle of Orgoglio as entered by the victorious\r\nPrince Arthur,—\r\n\r\nWhen ’gan he loudly through the house to call,\r\n        But no man cared to answer to his cry;\r\n    There reign’d a solemn silence over all,\r\nNor voice was heard, nor wight was seen in bower or hall.\r\n\r\n\r\nFilled almost with expectation of beholding some “old, old man, with\r\nbeard as white as snow,” whom he might question concerning this\r\ndeserted mansion, our hero turned to a little oaken wicket-door, well\r\nclenched with iron-nails, which opened in the court-yard wall at its\r\nangle with the house. It was only latched, notwithstanding its\r\nfortified appearance, and, when opened, admitted him into the garden,\r\nwhich presented a pleasant scene.[*] The southern side of the house,\r\nclothed with fruit-trees, and having many evergreens trained upon its\r\nwalls, extended its irregular yet venerable front along a terrace,\r\npartly paved, partly gravelled, partly bordered with flowers and choice\r\nshrubs. This elevation descended by three several flights of steps,\r\nplaced in its centre and at the extremities, into what might be called\r\nthe garden proper, and was fenced along the top by a stone parapet with\r\na heavy balustrade, ornamented from space to space with huge grotesque\r\nfigures of animals seated upon their haunches, among which the\r\nfavourite bear was repeatedly introduced. Placed in the middle of the\r\nterrace between a sashed-door opening from the house and the central\r\nflight of steps, a huge animal of the same species supported on his\r\nhead and fore-paws a sun-dial of large circumference, inscribed with\r\nmore diagrams than Edward’s mathematics enabled him to decipher.\r\n\r\n[* At Ravelston may be seen such a garden, which the taste of the\r\nproprietor, the author’s friend and kinsman, Sir Alexander Keith,\r\nKnight Mareschal, has judiciously preserved. That, as well as the house\r\nis, however, of smaller dimensions than the Baron of Bradwardine’s\r\nmansion and garden are presumed to have been.]\r\n\r\n\r\nThe garden, which seemed to be kept with great accuracy, abounded in\r\nfruit-trees, and exhibited a profusion of flowers and evergreens, cut\r\ninto grotesque forms. It was laid out in terraces, which descended rank\r\nby rank from the western wall to a large brook, which had a tranquil\r\nand smooth appearance, where it served as a boundary to the garden;\r\nbut, near the extremity, leapt in tumult over a strong dam, or\r\nwear-head, the cause of its temporary tranquillity, and there forming a\r\ncascade, was overlooked by an octangular summer-house, with a gilded\r\nbear on the top by way of vane. After this feat, the brook, assuming\r\nits natural rapid and fierce character, escaped from the eye down a\r\ndeep and wooded dell, from the copse of which arose a massive, but\r\nruinous tower, the former habitation of the Barons of Bradwardine. The\r\nmargin of the brook, opposite to the garden, displayed a narrow meadow,\r\nor haugh, as it was called, which formed a small washing-green; the\r\nbank, which retired behind it, was covered by ancient trees.\r\n\r\nThe scene, though pleasing, was not quite equal to the gardens of\r\nAlcina; yet wanted not the “due donzellette garrule” of that enchanted\r\nparadise, for upon the green aforesaid two bare-legged damsels, each\r\nstanding in a spacious tub, performed with their feet the office of a\r\npatent washing-machine. These did not, however, like the maidens of\r\nArmida, remain to greet with their harmony the approaching guest, but,\r\nalarmed at the appearance of a handsome stranger on the opposite side,\r\ndropped their garments (I should say garment, to be quite correct) over\r\ntheir limbs, which their occupation exposed somewhat too freely, and,\r\nwith a shrill exclamation of “Eh, sirs!” uttered with an accent between\r\nmodesty and coquetry, sprung off like deer in different directions.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nWaverley began to despair of gaining entrance into this solitary and\r\nseemingly enchanted mansion, when a man advanced up one of the garden\r\nalleys, where he still retained his station. Trusting this might be a\r\ngardener, or some domestic belonging to the house, Edward descended the\r\nsteps in order to meet him; but as the figure approached, and long\r\nbefore he could descry its features, he was struck with the oddity of\r\nits appearance and gestures. Sometimes this mister wight held his hands\r\nclasped over his head, like an Indian Jogue in the attitude of penance;\r\nsometimes he swung them perpendicularly, like a pendulum, on each side;\r\nand anon he slapped them swiftly and repeatedly across his breast, like\r\nthe substitute used by a hackney-coachman for his usual flogging\r\nexercise, when his cattle are idle upon the stand, in a clear frosty\r\nday. His gait was as singular as his gestures, for at times he hopped\r\nwith great perseverance on the right foot, then exchanged that\r\nsupporter to advance in the same manner on the left, and then putting\r\nhis feet close together he hopped upon both at once. His attire also\r\nwas antiquated and extravagant. It consisted in a sort of grey jerkin,\r\nwith scarlet cuffs and slashed sleeves, showing a scarlet lining; the\r\nother parts of the dress corresponded in colour, not forgetting a pair\r\nof scarlet stockings, and a scarlet bonnet, proudly surmounted with a\r\nturkey’s feather. Edward, whom he did not seem to observe, now\r\nperceived confirmation in his features of what the mien and gestures\r\nhad already announced. It was apparently neither idiocy nor insanity\r\nwhich gave that wild, unsettled, irregular expression to a face which\r\nnaturally was rather handsome, but something that resembled a compound\r\nof both, where the simplicity of the fool was mixed with the\r\nextravagance of a crazed imagination. He sung with great earnestness,\r\nand not without some taste, a fragment of an old Scottish ditty:—\r\n\r\nFalse love, and hast thou play’d me this\r\n    In summer among the flowers?\r\nI will repay thee back again\r\n    In winter among the showers.\r\nUnless again, again, my love,\r\n    Unless you turn again;\r\nAs you with other maidens rove,\r\n    I’ll smile on other men.[*]\r\n\r\n\r\n[* This is a genuine ancient fragment, with some alteration in the two\r\nlast lines.]\r\n\r\n\r\nHere lifting up his eyes, which had hitherto been fixed in observing\r\nhow his feet kept time to the tune, he beheld Waverley, and instantly\r\ndoffed his cap, with many grotesque signals of surprise, respect, and\r\nsalutation. Edward, though with little hope of receiving an answer to\r\nany constant question, requested to know whether Mr. Bradwardine were\r\nat home, or where he could find any of the domestics. The questioned\r\nparty replied, and, like the witch of Thalaba, “still his speech was\r\nsong,”—\r\n\r\nThe Knight’s to the mountain\r\n    His bugle to wind;\r\nThe Lady’s to greenwood\r\n    Her garland to bind.\r\nThe bower of Burd Ellen\r\n    Has moss on the floor,\r\nThat the step of Lord William\r\n    Be silent and sure.\r\n\r\n\r\nThis conveyed no information, and Edward, repeating his queries,\r\nreceived a rapid answer, in which, from the haste and peculiarity of\r\nthe dialect, the word “butler” was alone intelligible. Waverley then\r\nrequested to see the butler; upon which the fellow, with a knowing look\r\nand nod of intelligence, made a signal to Edward to follow, and began\r\nto dance and caper down the alley up which he had made his approaches.\r\nA strange guide this, thought Edward, and not much unlike one of\r\nShakespeare’s roynish clowns. I am not over prudent to trust to his\r\npilotage; but wiser men have been led by fools. By this time he reached\r\nthe bottom of the alley, where, turning short on a little parterre of\r\nflowers, shrouded from the east and north by a close yew hedge, he\r\nfound an old man at work without his coat, whose appearance hovered\r\nbetween that of an upper servant and gardener; his red nose and ruffled\r\nshirt belonging to the former profession; his hale and sunburnt visage,\r\nwith his green apron, appearing to indicate\r\n\r\n“Old Adam’s likeness, set to dress this garden.”\r\n\r\n\r\nThe major domo, for such he was, and indisputably the second officer of\r\nstate in the barony (nay, as chief minister of the interior, superior\r\neven to Bailie Macwheeble in his own department of the kitchen and\r\ncellar)—the major domo laid down his spade, slipped on his coat in\r\nhaste, and with a wrathful look at Edward’s guide, probably excited by\r\nhis having introduced a stranger while he was engaged in this\r\nlaborious, and, as he might suppose it, degrading office, requested to\r\nknow the gentleman’s commands. Being informed that he wished to pay his\r\nrespects to his master, that his name was Waverley, and so forth, the\r\nold man’s countenance assumed a great deal of respectful importance.\r\n“He could take it upon his conscience to say, his honour would have\r\nexceeding pleasure in seeing him. Would not Mr. Waverley choose some\r\nrefreshment after his journey? His honour was with the folk who were\r\ngetting doon the dark hag; the twa gardener lads (an emphasis on the\r\nword twa) had been ordered to attend him; and he had been just amusing\r\nhimself in the mean time with dressing Miss Rose’s flower-bed, that he\r\nmight be near to receive his honour’s orders, if need were; he was very\r\nfond of a garden, but had little time for such divertisements.”\r\n\r\n“He canna get it wrought in abune twa days in the week at no rate\r\nwhatever,” said Edward’s fantastic conductor.\r\n\r\nA grim look from the butler chastised his interference, and he\r\ncommanded him, by the name of Davie Gellatley, in a tone which admitted\r\nno discussion, to look for his honour at the dark hag, and tell him\r\nthere was a gentleman from the south had arrived at the Ha’.\r\n\r\n“Can this poor fellow deliver a letter?” asked Edward.\r\n\r\n“With all fidelity, sir, to any one whom he respects. I would hardly\r\ntrust him with a long message by word of mouth—though he is more knave\r\nthan fool.”\r\n\r\nWaverley delivered his credentials to Mr. Gellatley, who seemed to\r\nconfirm the butler’s last observation, by twisting his features at him,\r\nwhen he was looking another way, into the resemblance of the grotesque\r\nface on the bole of a German tobacco pipe; after which, with an odd\r\n_congé_ to Waverley, he danced off to discharge his errand.\r\n\r\n“He is an innocent, sir,” said the butler; “there is one such in almost\r\nevery town in the country, but ours is brought far ben. He used to work\r\na day’s turn weel enough; but he helped Miss Rose when she was flemit\r\nwith the Laird of Killancureit’s new English bull, and since that time\r\nwe ca’ him Davie Do-little; indeed we might ca’ him Davie Do-naething,\r\nfor since he got that gay clothing, to please his honour and my young\r\nmistress (great folks will have their fancies), he has done naething\r\nbut dance up and down about the _toun_, without doing a single turn,\r\nunless trimming the laird’s fishing-wand or busking his flies, or may\r\nbe catching a dish of trouts at an orra time. But here comes Miss Rose,\r\nwho, I take burden upon me for her, will be especial glad to see one of\r\nthe house of Waverley at her father’s mansion of Tully-Veolan.”\r\n\r\nBut Rose Bradwardine deserves better of her unworthy historian than to\r\nbe introduced at the end of a chapter.\r\n\r\nIn the mean while it may be noticed, that Waverley learned two things\r\nfrom this colloquy: that in Scotland a single house was called a\r\n“town”, and a natural fool an “innocent”.[8]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER X.\r\nROSE BRADWARDINE AND HER FATHER\r\n\r\n\r\nMiss Bradwardine was but seventeen; yet, at the last races of the\r\ncounty town of——, upon her health being proposed among a round of\r\nbeauties, the Laird of Bumperquaigh, permanent toast-master and\r\ncroupier of the Bautherwhillery Club, not only said “More” to the\r\npledge in a pint bumper of Bourdeaux, but, ere pouring forth the\r\nlibation, denominated the divinity to whom it was dedicated, “the Rose\r\nof Tully-Veolan”; upon which festive occasion three cheers were given\r\nby all the sitting members of that respectable society, whose throats\r\nthe wine had left capable of such exertion. Nay, I am well assured,\r\nthat the sleeping partners of the company snorted applause, and that\r\nalthough strong bumpers and weak brains had consigned two or three to\r\nthe floor, yet even these, fallen as they were from their high estate,\r\nand weltering—I will carry the parody no farther—uttered divers\r\ninarticulate sounds, intimating their assent to the motion.\r\n\r\nSuch unanimous applause could not be extorted but by acknowledged\r\nmerit; and Rose Bradwardine not only deserved it, but also the\r\napprobation of much more rational persons than the Bautherwhillery Club\r\ncould have mustered, even before discussion of the first _magnum_. She\r\nwas indeed a very pretty girl of the Scotch cast of beauty, that is,\r\nwith a profusion of hair of paley gold, and a skin like the snow of her\r\nown mountains in whiteness. Yet she had not a pallid or pensive cast of\r\ncountenance; her features, as well as her temper, had a lively\r\nexpression; her complexion, though not florid, was so pure as to seem\r\ntransparent, and the slightest emotion sent her whole blood at once to\r\nher face and neck. Her form, though under the common size, was\r\nremarkably elegant, and her motions light, easy, and unembarrassed. She\r\ncame from another part of the garden to receive Captain Waverley, with\r\na manner that hovered between bashfulness and courtesy.\r\n\r\nThe first greetings past, Edward learned from her that the _dark hag_,\r\nwhich had somewhat puzzled him in the butler’s account of his master’s\r\navocations, had nothing to do either with a black cat or a broomstick,\r\nbut was simply a portion of oak copse which was to be felled that day.\r\nShe offered, with diffident civility, to show the stranger the way to\r\nthe spot, which, it seems, was not far distant; but they were prevented\r\nby the appearance of the Baron of Bradwardine in person, who, summoned\r\nby David Gellatley, now appeared, “on hospitable thoughts intent,”\r\nclearing the ground at a prodigious rate with swift and long strides,\r\nwhich reminded Waverley of the seven-league boots of the nursery fable.\r\nHe was a tall, thin, athletic figure, old indeed and grey-haired, but\r\nwith every muscle rendered as tough as whip-cord by constant exercise.\r\nHe was dressed carelessly, and more like a Frenchman than an Englishman\r\nof the period, while, from his hard features and perpendicular rigidity\r\nof stature, he bore some resemblance to a Swiss officer of the guards,\r\nwho had resided some time at Paris, and caught the _costume_, but not\r\nthe ease or manner, of its inhabitants. The truth was, that his\r\nlanguage and habits were as heterogeneous as his external appearance.\r\n\r\nOwing to his natural disposition to study, or perhaps to a very general\r\nScottish fashion of giving young men of rank a legal education, he had\r\nbeen bred with a view to the bar. But the politics of his family\r\nprecluding the hope of his rising in that profession, Mr. Bradwardine\r\ntravelled with high reputation for several years, and made some\r\ncampaigns in foreign service. After his _démêlée_ with the law of high\r\ntreason in 1715, he had lived in retirement, conversing almost entirely\r\nwith those of his own principles in the vicinage. The pedantry of the\r\nlawyer, superinduced upon the military pride of the soldier, might\r\nremind a modern of the days of the zealous volunteer service, when the\r\nbar-gown of our pleaders was often flung over a blazing uniform. To\r\nthis must be added the prejudices of ancient birth and Jacobite\r\npolitics, greatly strengthened by habits of solitary and secluded\r\nauthority, which, though exercised only within the bounds of his\r\nhalf-cultivated estate, was there indisputable and undisputed. For, as\r\nhe used to observe, “the lands of Bradwardine, Tully-Veolan, and\r\nothers, had been erected into a free barony by a charter from David the\r\nFirst, cum liberali potest. habendi curias et justicias, cum fossa et\r\nfurca (_lie_, pit and gallows) et saka et soka, et thol et theam, et\r\ninfang-thief et outfang-thief, sive hand-habend, sive bak-barand.” The\r\npeculiar meaning of all these cabalistical words few or none could\r\nexplain; but they implied, upon the whole, that the Baron of\r\nBradwardine might, in case of delinquency, imprison, try, and execute\r\nhis vassals at his pleasure. Like James the First, however, the present\r\npossessor of this authority was more pleased in talking about\r\nprerogative than in exercising it; and excepting that he imprisoned two\r\npoachers in the dungeon of the old tower of Tully-Veolan, where they\r\nwere sorely frightened by ghosts, and almost eaten by rats, and that he\r\nset an old woman in the _jougs_ (or Scottish pillory) for saying “there\r\nwere mair fules in the laird’s ha’ house than Davie Gellatley,” I do\r\nnot learn that he was accused of abusing his high powers. Still,\r\nhowever, the conscious pride of possessing them gave additional\r\nimportance to his language and deportment.\r\n\r\nAt his first address to Waverley, it would seem that the hearty\r\npleasure he felt to behold the nephew of his friend had somewhat\r\ndiscomposed the stiff and upright dignity of the Baron of Bradwardine’s\r\ndemeanour, for the tears stood in the old gentleman’s eyes, when,\r\nhaving first shaken Edward heartily by the hand in the English fashion,\r\nhe embraced him _à la mode Française_, and kissed him on both sides of\r\nhis face; while the hardness of his gripe, and the quantity of Scotch\r\nsnuff which his accolade communicated, called corresponding drops of\r\nmoisture to the eyes of his guest.\r\n\r\n“Upon the honour of a gentleman,” he said, “but it makes me young again\r\nto see you here, Mr. Waverley! A worthy scion of the old stock of\r\nWaverley-Honour—_spes altera_, as Maro hath it—and you have the look of\r\nthe old line, Captain Waverley; not so portly yet as my old friend Sir\r\nEverard—_mais cela viendra avec le temps_, as my Dutch acquaintance,\r\nBaron Kikkitbroeck, said of the _sagesse of madame son épouse_. And so\r\nye have mounted the cockade? Right, right; though I could have wished\r\nthe colour different, and so I would ha’ deemed might Sir Everard. But\r\nno more of that; I am old, and times are changed. And how does the\r\nworthy knight baronet, and the fair Mrs. Rachel?—Ah, ye laugh, young\r\nman! In troth she was the fair Mrs. Rachel in the year of grace\r\nseventeen hundred and sixteen; but time passes—_et singula prædantur\r\nanni_—that is most certain. But once again ye are most heartily welcome\r\nto my poor house of Tully-Veolan! Hie to the house, Rose, and see that\r\nAlexander Saunderson looks out the old Château Margaux, which I sent\r\nfrom Bourdeaux to Dundee in the year 1713.”\r\n\r\nRose tripped off demurely enough till she turned the first corner, and\r\nthen ran with the speed of a fairy, that she might gain leisure, after\r\ndischarging her father’s commission, to put her own dress in order, and\r\nproduce all her little finery, an occupation for which the approaching\r\ndinner-hour left but limited time.\r\n\r\n“We cannot rival the luxuries of your English table, Captain Waverley,\r\nor give you the _epulæ lautiores_ of Waverley-Honour. I say ‘epulæ’\r\nrather than prandium, because the latter phrase is popular: epulae ad\r\nsenatum, prandium vero ad populum attinet, says Suetonius Tranquillus.\r\nBut I trust ye will applaud my Bourdeaux; _c’est des doux oreilles_, as\r\nCaptain Vinsauf used to say; _vinum primæ notæ_, the principal of Saint\r\nAndrews denominated it. And, once more, Captain Waverley, right glad am\r\nI that ye are here to drink the best my cellar can make forthcoming.”\r\n\r\nThis speech, with the necessary interjectional answers, continued from\r\nthe lower alley where they met up to the door of the house, where four\r\nor five servants in old-fashioned liveries, headed by Alexander\r\nSaunderson, the butler, who now bore no token of the sable stains of\r\nthe garden, received them in grand _costume_,\r\n\r\nIn an old hall hung round with pikes and with bows,\r\nWith old bucklers and corslets that had borne many shrewd blows.\r\n\r\n\r\nWith much ceremony, and still more real kindness, the Baron, without\r\nstopping in any intermediate apartment, conducted his guest through\r\nseveral into the great dining parlour, wainscotted with black oak, and\r\nhung round with the pictures of his ancestry, where a table was set\r\nforth in form for six persons, and an old-fashioned beaufet displayed\r\nall the ancient and massive plate of the Bradwardine family. A bell was\r\nnow heard at the head of the avenue; for an old man, who acted as\r\nporter upon gala days, had caught the alarm given by Waverley’s\r\narrival, and, repairing to his post, announced the arrival of other\r\nguests.\r\n\r\nThese, as the Baron assured his young friend, were very estimable\r\npersons. “There was the young Laird of Balmawhapple, a Falconer by\r\nsurname, of the house of Glenfarquhar, given right much to\r\nfield-sports—_gaudet equis et canibus_—but a very discreet young\r\ngentleman. Then there was the Laird of Killancureit, who had devoted\r\nhis leisure _until_ tillage and agriculture, and boasted himself to be\r\npossessed of a bull of matchless merit, brought from the county of\r\nDevon (the Damnonia of the Romans, if we can trust Robert of\r\nCirencester). He is, as ye may well suppose from such a tendency, but\r\nof yeoman extraction—_servabit odorem testa diu;_ and I believe,\r\nbetween ourselves, his grandsire was from the wrong side of the\r\nBorder—one Bullsegg, who came hither as a steward, or bailiff, or\r\nground-officer, or something in that department, to the last Girnigo of\r\nKillancureit, who died of an atrophy. After his master’s death, sir,—ye\r\nwould hardly believe such a scandal,—but this Bullsegg, being portly\r\nand comely of aspect, intermarried with the lady dowager, who was young\r\nand amorous, and possessed himself of the estate, which devolved on\r\nthis unhappy woman by a settlement of her umwhile husband, in direct\r\ncontravention of an unrecorded taillie, and to the prejudice of the\r\ndisponer’s own flesh and blood, in the person of his natural heir and\r\nseventh cousin, Girnigo of Tipperhewit, whose family was so reduced by\r\nthe ensuing law-suit, that his representative is now serving as a\r\nprivate gentleman-sentinel in the Highland Black Watch. But this\r\ngentleman, Mr. Bullsegg of Killancureit that now is, has good blood in\r\nhis veins by the mother and grandmother, who were both of the family of\r\nPickletillim, and he is well liked and looked upon, and knows his own\r\nplace. And God forbid, Captain Waverley, that we of irreproachable\r\nlineage should exult over him, when it may be, that in the eighth,\r\nninth, or tenth generation, his progeny may rank, in a manner, with the\r\nold gentry of the country. Rank and ancestry, sir, should be the last\r\nwords in the mouths of us of unblemished race—_vix ea nostra voco_, as\r\nNaso saith. There is, besides, a clergyman of the true (though\r\nsuffering) Episcopal church of Scotland. He was a confessor in her\r\ncause after the year 1715, when a Whiggish mob destroyed his\r\nmeeting-house, tore his surplice, and plundered his dwelling-house of\r\nfour silver spoons, intromitting also with his mart and his mealark,\r\nand with two barrels, one of single and one of double ale, besides\r\nthree bottles of brandy.[9] My baron-bailie and doer, Mr. Duncan\r\nMacwheeble, is the fourth on our list. There is a question, owing to\r\nthe incertitude of ancient orthography, whether he belongs to the clan\r\nof Wheedle or of Quibble, but both have produced persons eminent in the\r\nlaw.”—\r\n\r\n“As such he described them by person and name,\r\nThey enter’d, and dinner was served as they came.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XI.\r\nTHE BANQUET\r\n\r\n\r\nThe entertainment was ample and handsome, according to the Scotch ideas\r\nof the period, and the guests did great honour to it. The Baron ate\r\nlike a famished soldier, the Laird of Balmawhapple like a sportsman,\r\nBullsegg of Killancureit like a farmer, Waverley himself like a\r\ntraveller, and Bailie Macwheeble like all four together; though, either\r\nout of more respect, or in order to preserve that proper declination of\r\nperson which showed a sense that he was in the presence of his patron,\r\nhe sat upon the edge of his chair, placed at three feet distance from\r\nthe table, and achieved a communication with his plate by projecting\r\nhis person towards it in a line which obliqued from the bottom of his\r\nspine, so that the person who sat opposite to him could only see the\r\nforetop of his riding periwig.\r\n\r\nThis stooping position might have been inconvenient to another person;\r\nbut long habit made it, whether seated or walking, perfectly easy to\r\nthe worthy Bailie. In the latter posture it occasioned, no doubt, an\r\nunseemly projection of the person towards those who happened to walk\r\nbehind; but those being at all times his inferiors (for Mr. Macwheeble\r\nwas very scrupulous in giving place to all others), he cared very\r\nlittle what inference of contempt or slight regard they might derive\r\nfrom the circumstance. Hence, when he waddled across the court to and\r\nfrom his old grey pony, he somewhat resembled a turnspit walking upon\r\nits hind legs.\r\n\r\nThe nonjuring clergyman was a pensive and interesting old man, with\r\nmuch of the air of a sufferer for conscience’ sake. He was one of those\r\n\r\n“Who, undeprived, their benefice forsook.”\r\n\r\n\r\nFor this whim, when the Baron was out of hearing, the Bailie used\r\nsometimes gently to rally Mr. Rubrick, upbraiding him with the nicety\r\nof his scruples. Indeed, it must be owned, that he himself, though at\r\nheart a keen partisan of the exiled family, had kept pretty fair with\r\nall the different turns of state in his time; so that Davie Gellatley\r\nonce described him as a particularly good man, who had a very quiet and\r\npeaceful conscience, _that never did him any harm_.\r\n\r\nWhen the dinner was removed, the Baron announced the health of the\r\nKing, politely leaving to the consciences of his guests to drink to the\r\nsovereign _de facto_ or _de jure_, as their politics inclined. The\r\nconversation now became general; and, shortly afterwards, Miss\r\nBradwardine, who had done the honours with natural grace and\r\nsimplicity, retired, and was soon followed by the clergyman. Among the\r\nrest of the party, the wine, which fully justified the encomiums of the\r\nlandlord, flowed freely round, although Waverley, with some difficulty,\r\nobtained the privilege of sometimes neglecting the glass. At length, as\r\nthe evening grew more late, the Baron made a private signal to Mr.\r\nSaunders Saunderson, or, as he facetiously denominated him, _Alexander\r\nab Alexandro_, who left the room with a nod, and soon after returned,\r\nhis grave countenance mantling with a solemn and mysterious smile, and\r\nplaced before his master a small oaken casket, mounted with brass\r\nornaments of curious form. The Baron, drawing out a private key,\r\nunlocked the casket, raised the lid, and produced a golden goblet of a\r\nsingular and antique appearance, moulded into the shape of a rampant\r\nbear, which the owner regarded with a look of mingled reverence, pride,\r\nand delight, that irresistibly reminded Waverley of Ben Jonson’s Tom\r\nOtter, with his Bull, Horse, and Dog, as that wag wittily denominated\r\nhis chief carousing cups. But Mr. Bradwardine, turning towards him with\r\ncomplacency, requested him to observe this curious relic of the olden\r\ntime.\r\n\r\n“It represents,” he said, “the chosen crest of our family, a bear, as\r\nye observe, and _rampant;_ because a good herald will depict every\r\nanimal in its noblest posture, as a horse _salient_, a greyhound\r\n_currant_, and, as may be inferred, a ravenous animal _in actu\r\nferociori_, or in a voracious, lacerating, and devouring posture. Now,\r\nsir, we hold this most honourable achievement by the wappen-brief, or\r\nconcession of arms, of Frederick Red-beard, Emperor of Germany, to my\r\npredecessor, Godmund Bradwardine, it being the crest of a gigantic\r\nDane, whom he slew in the lists in the Holy Land, on a quarrel touching\r\nthe chastity of the emperor’s spouse or daughter, tradition saith not\r\nprecisely which, and thus, as Virgilius hath it—\r\n\r\n“‘Mutemus clypeos, Danaumque insignia nobis\r\nAptemus.’\r\n\r\n\r\nThen for the cup, Captain Waverley, it was wrought by the command of\r\nSaint Duthac, Abbot of Aberbrothock, for behoof of another baron of the\r\nhouse of Bradwardine, who had valiantly defended the patrimony of that\r\nmonastery against certain encroaching nobles. It is properly termed the\r\nBlessed Bear of Bradwardine (though old Doctor Doubleit used jocosely\r\nto call it Ursa Major), and was supposed, in old and Catholic times, to\r\nbe invested with certain properties of a mystical and supernatural\r\nquality. And though I give not in to such _anilia_, it is certain it\r\nhas always been esteemed a solemn standard cup and heirloom of our\r\nhouse; nor is it ever used but upon seasons of high festival, and such\r\nI hold to be the arrival of the heir of Sir Everard under my roof; and\r\nI devote this draught to the health and prosperity of the ancient and\r\nhighly-to-be-honoured house of Waverley.”\r\n\r\nDuring this long harangue, he carefully decanted a cob-webbed bottle of\r\nclaret into the goblet, which held nearly an English pint; and, at the\r\nconclusion, delivering the bottle to the butler, to be held carefully\r\nin the same angle with the horizon, he devoutly quaffed off the\r\ncontents of the Blessed Bear of Bradwardine.\r\n\r\nEdward, with horror and alarm, beheld the animal making his rounds, and\r\nthought with great anxiety upon the appropriate motto, “Beware the\r\nBear”; but, at the same time, plainly foresaw that, as none of the\r\nguests scrupled to do him this extraordinary honour, a refusal on his\r\npart to pledge their courtesy would be extremely ill received.\r\nResolving, therefore, to submit to this last piece of tyranny, and then\r\nto quit the table, if possible, and confiding in the strength of his\r\nconstitution, he did justice to the company in the contents of the\r\nBlessed Bear, and felt less inconvenience from the draught than he\r\ncould possibly have expected. The others, whose time had been more\r\nactively employed, began to show symptoms of innovation—“the good wine\r\ndid its good office.”[*] The frost of etiquette and pride of birth\r\nbegan to give way before the genial blessings of this benign\r\nconstellation, and the formal appellatives with which the three\r\ndignitaries had hitherto addressed each other were now familiarly\r\nabbreviated into Tully, Bally, and Killie. When a few rounds had\r\npassed, the two latter, after whispering together, craved permission (a\r\njoyful hearing for Edward) to ask the grace-cup. This, after some\r\ndelay, was at length produced, and Waverley concluded the orgies of\r\nBacchus were terminated for the evening. He was never more mistaken in\r\nhis life.\r\n\r\n[* Southey’s Madoc.]\r\n\r\n\r\nAs the guests had left their horses at the small inn, or\r\n_change-house_, as it was called, of the village, the Baron could not,\r\nin politeness, avoid walking with them up the avenue, and Waverley from\r\nthe same motive, and to enjoy after this feverish revel the cool summer\r\nevening, attended the party. But when they arrived at Luckie Macleary’s\r\nthe Lairds of Balmawhapple and Killancureit declared their\r\ndetermination to acknowledge their sense of the hospitality of\r\nTully-Veolan by partaking, with their entertainer and his guest Captain\r\nWaverley, what they technically called _deoch an doruis_, a\r\nstirrup-cup, to the honour of the Baron’s roof-tree.[10]\r\n\r\nIt must be noticed that the Bailie, knowing by experience that the\r\nday’s jovialty, which had been hitherto sustained at the expense of his\r\npatron, might terminate partly at his own, had mounted his spavined\r\ngrey pony, and, between gaiety of heart and alarm for being hooked into\r\na reckoning, spurred him into a hobbling canter (a trot was out of the\r\nquestion), and had already cleared the village. The others entered the\r\nchange-house, leading Edward in unresisting submission; for his\r\nlandlord whispered him, that to demur to such an overture would be\r\nconstrued into a high misdemeanour against the _leges conviviales_, or\r\nregulations of genial compotation. Widow Macleary seemed to have\r\nexpected this visit, as well she might, for it was the usual\r\nconsummation of merry bouts, not only at Tully-Veolan, but at most\r\nother gentlemen’s houses in Scotland, Sixty Years Since. The guests\r\nthereby at once acquitted themselves of their burden of gratitude for\r\ntheir entertainer’s kindness, encouraged the trade of his change-house,\r\ndid honour to the place which afforded harbour to their horses, and\r\nindemnified themselves for the previous restraints imposed by private\r\nhospitality, by spending what Falstaff calls the sweet of the night in\r\nthe genial license of a tavern.\r\n\r\nAccordingly, in full expectation of these distinguished guests, Luckie\r\nMacleary had swept her house for the first time this fortnight,\r\ntempered her turf-fire to such a heat as the season required in her\r\ndamp hovel even at Midsummer, set forth her deal table newly washed,\r\npropped its lame foot with a fragment of turf, arranged four or five\r\nstools of huge and clumsy form upon the sites which best suited the\r\ninequalities of her clay floor; and having, moreover, put on her clean\r\ntoy, rokelay, and scarlet plaid, gravely awaited the arrival of the\r\ncompany, in full hope of custom and profit. When they were seated under\r\nthe sooty rafters of Luckie Macleary’s only apartment, thickly\r\ntapestried with cobwebs, their hostess, who had already taken her cue\r\nfrom the Laird of Balmawhapple, appeared with a huge pewter\r\nmeasuring-pot, containing at least three English quarts, familiarly\r\ndenominated a Tappit Hen, and which, in the language of the hostess,\r\nreamed (_i.e._, mantled) with excellent claret just drawn from the\r\ncask.\r\n\r\nIt was soon plain that what crumbs of reason the Bear had not devoured\r\nwere to be picked up by the Hen; but the confusion which appeared to\r\nprevail favoured Edward’s resolution to evade the gaily circling glass.\r\nThe others began to talk thick and at once, each performing his own\r\npart in the conversation without the least respect to his neighbour.\r\nThe Baron of Bradwardine sung French _chansons à boire_, and spouted\r\npieces of Latin; Killancureit talked, in a steady unalterable dull key,\r\nof top-dressing and bottom-dressing,[*] and year-olds, and gimmers, and\r\ndinmonts, and stots, and runts, and kyloes, and a proposed\r\nturnpike-act; while Balmawhapple, in notes exalted above both, extolled\r\nhis horse, his hawks, and a greyhound called Whistler. In the middle of\r\nthis din, the Baron repeatedly implored silence; and when at length the\r\ninstinct of polite discipline so far prevailed that for a moment he\r\nobtained it, he hastened to beseech their attention “unto a military\r\nariette, which was a particular favourite of the Maréchal Duc de\r\nBerwick”; then, imitating, as well as he could, the manner and tone of\r\na French musquetaire, he immediately commenced,—\r\n\r\n“Mon cœur volage, dit elle,\r\n    N’est pas pour vous, garçon;\r\nEst pour un homme de guerre,\r\n    Qui a barbe au menton.\r\n        Lon, Lon, Laridon.\r\n\r\n“Qui port chapeau à plume,\r\n    Soulier à rouge talon,\r\nQui joue de la flute,\r\n    Aussi du violon.\r\n        Lon, Lon, Laridon.”\r\n\r\n\r\n[* This has been censured as an anachronism; and it must be confessed\r\nthat agriculture of this kind was unknown to the Scotch Sixty Years\r\nSince.]\r\n\r\n\r\nBalmawhapple could hold no longer, but broke in with what he called a\r\nd—d good song, composed by Gibby Gaethroughwi’t, the piper of Cupar;\r\nand, without wasting more time, struck up,—\r\n\r\nIt’s up Glenbarchan’s braes I gaed,\r\nAnd o’er the bent of Killiebraid,\r\nAnd mony a weary cast I made,\r\n    To cuittle the moor-fowl’s tail.[*]\r\n\r\n\r\n[* _Suum cuique_. This snatch of a ballad was composed by Andrew\r\nMacDonald, the ingenious and unfortunate author of “Vimonda”.]\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Baron, whose voice was drowned in the louder and more obstreperous\r\nstrains of Balmawhapple, now dropped the competition, but continued to\r\nhum “Lon, Lon, Laridon,” and to regard the successful candidate for the\r\nattention of the company with an eye of disdain, while Balmawhapple\r\nproceeded,—\r\n\r\nIf up a bonny black-cock should spring,\r\nTo whistle him down wi’ a slug in his wing,\r\nAnd strap him on to my lunzie string,\r\n    Right seldom would I fail.\r\n\r\n\r\nAfter an ineffectual attempt to recover the second verse, he sung the\r\nfirst over again; and, in prosecution of his triumph, declared there\r\nwas “more sense in that than in all the _derry-dongs_ of France, and\r\nFifeshire to the boot of it.” The Baron only answered with a long pinch\r\nof snuff and a glance of infinite contempt. But those noble allies, the\r\nBear and the Hen, had emancipated the young laird from the habitual\r\nreverence in which he held Bradwardine at other times. He pronounced\r\nthe claret “shilpit,” and demanded brandy with great vociferation. It\r\nwas brought; and now the Demon of Politics envied even the harmony\r\narising from this Dutch concert, merely because there was not a\r\nwrathful note in the strange compound of sounds which it produced.\r\nInspired by her, the Laird of Balmawhapple, now superior to the nods\r\nand winks with which the Baron of Bradwardine, in delicacy to Edward,\r\nhad hitherto checked his entering upon political discussion, demanded a\r\nbumper, with the lungs of a Stentor, “to the little gentleman in black\r\nvelvet who did such service in 1702, and may the white horse break his\r\nneck over a mound of his making!”\r\n\r\nEdward was not at that moment clear-headed enough to remember that King\r\nWilliam’s fall, which occasioned his death, was said to be owing to his\r\nhorse stumbling at a mole-hill; yet felt inclined to take umbrage at a\r\ntoast which seemed, from the glance of Balmawhapple’s eye, to have a\r\npeculiar and uncivil reference to the Government which he served. But,\r\nere he could interfere, the Baron of Bradwardine had taken up the\r\nquarrel. “Sir,” he said, “whatever my sentiments _tanquam privatus_ may\r\nbe in such matters, I shall not tamely endure your saying anything that\r\nmay impinge upon the honourable feelings of a gentleman under my roof.\r\nSir, if you have no respect for the laws of urbanity, do ye not respect\r\nthe military oath, the _sacramentum militare_, by which every officer\r\nis bound to the standards under which he is enrolled? Look at Titus\r\nLivius, what he says of those Roman soldiers who were so unhappy as\r\n_exuere sacramentum_, to renounce their legionary oath; but you are\r\nignorant, sir, alike of ancient history and modern courtesy.”\r\n\r\n“Not so ignorant as ye would pronounce me,” roared Balmawhapple. “I ken\r\nweel that you mean the Solemn League and Covenant; but if a’ the Whigs\r\nin hell had taken the—”\r\n\r\nHere the Baron and Waverley both spoke at once, the former calling out,\r\n“Be silent, sir! ye not only show your ignorance, but disgrace your\r\nnative country before a stranger and an Englishman”; and Waverley, at\r\nthe same moment, entreating Mr. Bradwardine to permit him to reply to\r\nan affront which seemed levelled at him personally. But the Baron was\r\nexalted by wine, wrath, and scorn above all sublunary considerations.\r\n\r\n“I crave you to be hushed, Captain Waverley; you are elsewhere,\r\nperadventure, _sui juris_,—foris-familiated, that is, and entitled, it\r\nmay be, to think and resent for yourself; but in my domain, in this\r\npoor Barony of Bradwardine, and under this roof, which is _quasi_ mine,\r\nbeing held by tacit relocation by a tenant at will, I am _in loco\r\nparentis_ to you, and bound to see you scathless. And for you, Mr.\r\nFalconer of Balmawhapple, I warn ye, let me see no more aberrations\r\nfrom the paths of good manners.”\r\n\r\n“And I tell you, Mr. Cosmo Comyne Bradwardine of Bradwardine and\r\nTully-Veolan,” retorted the sportsman in huge disdain, “that I’ll make\r\na moor-cock of the man that refuses my toast, whether it be a\r\ncrop-eared English Whig wi’ a black ribband at his lug, or ane wha\r\ndeserts his ain friends to claw favour wi’ the rats of Hanover.”\r\n\r\nIn an instant both rapiers were brandished, and some desperate passes\r\nexchanged. Balmawhapple was young, stout, and active; but the Baron,\r\ninfinitely more master of his weapon, would, like Sir Toby Belch, have\r\ntickled his opponent other gates than he did had he not been under the\r\ninfluence of Ursa Major.\r\n\r\nEdward rushed forward to interfere between the combatants, but the\r\nprostrate bulk of the Laird of Killancureit, over which he stumbled,\r\nintercepted his passage. How Killancureit happened to be in this\r\nrecumbent posture at so interesting a moment was never accurately\r\nknown. Some thought he was about to insconce himself under the table;\r\nhe himself alleged that he stumbled in the act of lifting a\r\njoint-stool, to prevent mischief, by knocking down Balmawhapple. Be\r\nthat as it may, if readier aid than either his or Waverley’s had not\r\ninterposed, there would certainly have been bloodshed. But the\r\nwell-known clash of swords, which was no stranger to her dwelling,\r\naroused Luckie Macleary as she sat quietly beyond the hallan, or\r\nearthen partition of the cottage, with eyes employed on Boston’s “Crook\r\nthe Lot,” while her ideas were engaged in summing up the reckoning. She\r\nboldly rushed in, with the shrill expostulation, “Wad their honours\r\nslay ane another there, and bring discredit on an honest widow-woman’s\r\nhouse, when there was a’ the lee-land in the country to fight upon?” a\r\nremonstrance which she seconded by flinging her plaid with great\r\ndexterity over the weapons of the combatants. The servants by this time\r\nrushed in, and being, by great chance, tolerably sober, separated the\r\nincensed opponents, with the assistance of Edward and Killancureit. The\r\nlatter led off Balmawhapple, cursing, swearing, and vowing revenge\r\nagainst every Whig, Presbyterian, and fanatic in England and Scotland,\r\nfrom John-o’-Groat’s to the Land’s End, and with difficulty got him to\r\nhorse. Our hero, with the assistance of Saunders Saunderson, escorted\r\nthe Baron of Bradwardine to his own dwelling, but could not prevail\r\nupon him to retire to bed until he had made a long and learned apology\r\nfor the events of the evening, of which, however, there was not a word\r\nintelligible, except something about the Centaurs and the Lapithæ.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XII.\r\nREPENTANCE AND A RECONCILIATION\r\n\r\n\r\nWaverley was unaccustomed to the use of wine, excepting with great\r\ntemperance. He slept therefore soundly till late in the succeeding\r\nmorning, and then awakened to a painful recollection of the scene of\r\nthe preceding evening. He had received a personal affront—he, a\r\ngentleman, a soldier, and a Waverley. True, the person who offered it\r\nwas not, at the time it was given, possessed of the moderate share of\r\nsense which nature had allotted him; true also, in resenting this\r\ninsult, he would break the laws of Heaven as well as of his country;\r\ntrue, in doing so, he might take the life of a young man who perhaps\r\nrespectably discharged the social duties, and render his family\r\nmiserable, or he might lose his own—no pleasant alternative even to the\r\nbravest, when it is debated coolly and in private.\r\n\r\nAll this pressed on his mind; yet the original statement recurred with\r\nthe same irresistible force. He had received a personal insult; he was\r\nof the house of Waverley; and he bore a commission. There was no\r\nalternative; and he descended to the breakfast parlour with the\r\nintention of taking leave of the family, and writing to one of his\r\nbrother officers to meet him at the inn midway between Tully-Veolan and\r\nthe town where they were quartered, in order that he might convey such\r\na message to the Laird of Balmawhapple as the circumstances seemed to\r\ndemand. He found Miss Bradwardine presiding over the tea and coffee,\r\nthe table loaded with warm bread, both of flour, oatmeal, and\r\nbarleymeal, in the shape of loaves, cakes, biscuits, and other\r\nvarieties, together with eggs, reindeer ham, mutton and beef ditto,\r\nsmoked salmon, marmalade, and all the other delicacies which induced\r\neven Johnson himself to extol the luxury of a Scotch breakfast above\r\nthat of all other countries. A mess of oatmeal porridge, flanked by a\r\nsilver jug, which held an equal mixture of cream and butter-milk, was\r\nplaced for the Baron’s share of this repast; but Rose observed, he had\r\nwalked out early in the morning, after giving orders that his guest\r\nshould not be disturbed.\r\n\r\nWaverley sat down almost in silence, and with an air of absence and\r\nabstraction which could not give Miss Bradwardine a favourable opinion\r\nof his talents for conversation. He answered at random one or two\r\nobservations which she ventured to make upon ordinary topics; so that,\r\nfeeling herself almost repulsed in her efforts at entertaining him, and\r\nsecretly wondering that a scarlet coat should cover no better breeding,\r\nshe left him to his mental amusement of cursing Doctor Doubleit’s\r\nfavourite constellation of Ursa Major as the cause of all the mischief\r\nwhich had already happened and was likely to ensue. At once he started,\r\nand his colour heightened, as, looking toward the window, he beheld the\r\nBaron and young Balmawhapple pass arm in arm, apparently in deep\r\nconversation; and he hastily asked, “Did Mr. Falconer sleep here last\r\nnight?” Rose, not much pleased with the abruptness of the first\r\nquestion which the young stranger had addressed to her, answered drily\r\nin the negative, and the conversation again sunk into silence.\r\n\r\nAt this moment Mr. Saunderson appeared, with a message from his master,\r\nrequesting to speak with Captain Waverley in another apartment. With a\r\nheart which beat a little quicker, not indeed from fear, but from\r\nuncertainty and anxiety, Edward obeyed the summons. He found the two\r\ngentlemen standing together, an air of complacent dignity on the brow\r\nof the Baron, while something like sullenness or shame, or both,\r\nblanked the bold visage of Balmawhapple. The former slipped his arm\r\nthrough that of the latter, and thus seeming to walk with him, while in\r\nreality he led him, advanced to meet Waverley, and, stopping in the\r\nmidst of the apartment, made in great state the following oration:\r\n\r\n“Captain Waverley—my young and esteemed friend, Mr. Falconer of\r\nBalmawhapple, has craved of my age and experience, as of one not wholly\r\nunskilled in the dependencies and punctilios of the duello or\r\nmonomachia, to be his interlocutor in expressing to you the regret with\r\nwhich he calls to remembrance certain passages of our symposion last\r\nnight, which could not but be highly displeasing to you, as serving for\r\nthe time under this present existing government. He craves you, sir, to\r\ndrown in oblivion the memory of such solecisms against the laws of\r\npoliteness, as being what his better reason disavows, and to receive\r\nthe hand which he offers you in amity; and I must needs assure you that\r\nnothing less than a sense of being _dans son tort_, as a gallant French\r\nchevalier, Mons. Le Bretailleur, once said to me on such an occasion,\r\nand an opinion also of your peculiar merit, could have extorted such\r\nconcessions; for he and all his family are, and have been, time out of\r\nmind, _Mavortia pectora_, as Buchanan saith, a bold and warlike sept,\r\nor people.”\r\n\r\nEdward immediately, and with natural politeness, accepted the hand\r\nwhich Balmawhapple, or rather the Baron in his character of mediator,\r\nextended towards him. “It was impossible,” he said, “for him to\r\nremember what a gentleman expressed his wish he had not uttered; and he\r\nwillingly imputed what had passed to the exuberant festivity of the\r\nday.”\r\n\r\n“That is very handsomely said,” answered the Baron; “for undoubtedly,\r\nif a man be _ebrius_, or intoxicated, an incident which on solemn and\r\nfestive occasions may and will take place in the life of a man of\r\nhonour; and if the same gentleman, being fresh and sober, recants the\r\ncontumelies which he hath spoken in his liquor, it must be held _vinum\r\nlocutum est;_ the words cease to be his own. Yet would I not find this\r\nexculpation relevant in the case of one who was _ebriosus_, or an\r\nhabitual drunkard; because, if such a person choose to pass the greater\r\npart of his time in the predicament of intoxication, he hath no title\r\nto be exeemed from the obligations of the code of politeness, but\r\nshould learn to deport himself peaceably and courteously when under\r\ninfluence of the vinous stimulus. And now let us proceed to breakfast,\r\nand think no more of this daft business.”\r\n\r\nI must confess, whatever inference may be drawn from the circumstance,\r\nthat Edward, after so satisfactory an explanation, did much greater\r\nhonour to the delicacies of Miss Bradwardine’s breakfast-table than his\r\ncommencement had promised. Balmawhapple, on the contrary, seemed\r\nembarrassed and dejected; and Waverley now, for the first time,\r\nobserved that his arm was in a sling, which seemed to account for the\r\nawkward and embarrassed manner with which he had presented his hand. To\r\na question from Miss Bradwardine, he muttered in answer something about\r\nhis horse having fallen; and seeming desirous to escape both from the\r\nsubject and the company, he arose as soon as breakfast was over, made\r\nhis bow to the party, and, declining the Baron’s invitation to tarry\r\ntill after dinner, mounted his horse and returned to his own home.\r\n\r\nWaverley now announced his purpose of leaving Tully-Veolan early enough\r\nafter dinner to gain the stage at which he meant to sleep; but the\r\nunaffected and deep mortification with which the good-natured and\r\naffectionate old gentleman heard the proposal quite deprived him of\r\ncourage to persist in it. No sooner had he gained Waverley’s consent to\r\nlengthen his visit for a few days than he laboured to remove the\r\ngrounds upon which he conceived he had meditated a more early retreat.\r\n“I would not have you opine, Captain Waverley, that I am by practice or\r\nprecept an advocate of ebriety, though it may be that, in our festivity\r\nof last night, some of our friends, if not perchance altogether\r\n_ebrii_, or drunken, were, to say the least, _ebrioli_, by which the\r\nancients designed those who were fuddled, or, as your English\r\nvernacular and metaphorical phrase goes, half-seas-over. Not that I\r\nwould so insinuate respecting you, Captain Waverley, who, like a\r\nprudent youth, did rather abstain from potation; nor can it be truly\r\nsaid of myself, who, having assisted at the tables of many great\r\ngenerals and marechals at their solemn carousals, have the art to carry\r\nmy wine discreetly, and did not, during the whole evening, as ye must\r\nhave doubtless observed, exceed the bounds of a modest hilarity.”\r\n\r\nThere was no refusing assent to a proposition so decidedly laid down by\r\nhim, who undoubtedly was the best judge; although, had Edward formed\r\nhis opinion from his own recollections, he would have pronounced that\r\nthe Baron was not only _ebriolus_, but verging to become _ebrius;_ or,\r\nin plain English, was incomparably the most drunk of the party, except\r\nperhaps his antagonist the Laird of Balmawhapple. However, having\r\nreceived the expected, or rather the required, compliment on his\r\nsobriety, the Baron proceeded—“No, sir, though I am myself of a strong\r\ntemperament, I abhor ebriety, and detest those who swallow wine _gulæ\r\ncausa_, for the oblectation of the gullet; albeit I might deprecate the\r\nlaw of Pittacus of Mitylene, who punished doubly a crime committed\r\nunder the influence of _Liber Pater;_ nor would I utterly accede to the\r\nobjurgation of the younger Plinius, in the fourteenth book of his\r\n‘Historia Naturalis.’ No, sir, I distinguish, I discriminate, and\r\napprove of wine so far only as it maketh glad the face, or, in the\r\nlanguage of Flaccus, _recepto amico_.”\r\n\r\nThus terminated the apology which the Baron of Bradwardine thought it\r\nnecessary to make for the superabundance of his hospitality; and it may\r\nbe easily believed that he was neither interrupted by dissent nor any\r\nexpression of incredulity.\r\n\r\nHe then invited his guest to a morning ride, and ordered that Davie\r\nGellatley should meet them at the _dern path_ with Ban and Buscar.\r\n“For, until the shooting season commence, I would willingly show you\r\nsome sport, and we may, God willing, meet with a roe. The roe, Captain\r\nWaverley, may be hunted at all times alike; for never being in what is\r\ncalled _pride of grease_, he is also never out of season, though it be\r\na truth that his venison is not equal to that of either the red or\r\nfallow deer.[*] But he will serve to show how my dogs run; and\r\ntherefore they shall attend us with David Gellatley.”\r\n\r\n[* The learned in cookery dissent from the Baron of Bradwardine, and\r\nhold the roe venison dry and indifferent food, unless when dressed in\r\nsoup and Scotch collops.]\r\n\r\n\r\nWaverley expressed his surprise that his friend Davie was capable of\r\nsuch trust; but the Baron gave him to understand that this poor\r\nsimpleton was neither fatuous, _nec naturaliter idiota_, as is\r\nexpressed in the brieves of furiosity, but simply a crack-brained\r\nknave, who could execute very well any commission which jumped with his\r\nown humour, and made his folly a plea for avoiding every other. “He has\r\nmade an interest with us,” continued the Baron, “by saving Rose from a\r\ngreat danger with his own proper peril; and the roguish loon must\r\ntherefore eat of our bread and drink of our cup, and do what he can, or\r\nwhat he will, which, if the suspicions of Saunderson and the Bailie are\r\nwell founded, may perchance in his case be commensurate terms.”\r\n\r\nMiss Bradwardine then gave Waverley to understand that this poor\r\nsimpleton was dotingly fond of music, deeply affected by that which was\r\nmelancholy, and transported into extravagant gaiety by light and lively\r\nairs. He had in this respect a prodigious memory, stored with\r\nmiscellaneous snatches and fragments of all tunes and songs, which he\r\nsometimes applied, with considerable address, as the vehicles of\r\nremonstrance, explanation, or satire. Davie was much attached to the\r\nfew who showed him kindness; and both aware of any slight or ill usage\r\nwhich he happened to receive, and sufficiently apt, where he saw\r\nopportunity, to revenge it. The common people, who often judge hardly\r\nof each other as well as of their betters, although they had expressed\r\ngreat compassion for the poor _innocent_ while suffered to wander in\r\nrags about the village, no sooner beheld him decently clothed, provided\r\nfor, and even a sort of favourite, than they called up all the\r\ninstances of sharpness and ingenuity, in action and repartee, which his\r\nannals afforded, and charitably bottomed thereupon a hypothesis that\r\nDavid Gellatley was no farther fool than was necessary to avoid hard\r\nlabour. This opinion was not better founded than that of the Negroes,\r\nwho, from the acute and mischievous pranks of the monkeys, suppose that\r\nthey have the gift of speech, and only suppress their powers of\r\nelocution to escape being set to work. But the hypothesis was entirely\r\nimaginary; David Gellatley was in good earnest the half-crazed\r\nsimpleton which he appeared, and was incapable of any constant and\r\nsteady exertion. He had just so much solidity as kept on the windy side\r\nof insanity, so much wild wit as saved him from the imputation of\r\nidiocy, some dexterity in field-sports (in which we have known as great\r\nfools excel), great kindness and humanity in the treatment of animals\r\nentrusted to him, warm affections, a prodigious memory, and an ear for\r\nmusic.\r\n\r\nThe stamping of horses was now heard in the court, and Davie’s voice\r\nsinging to the two large deer greyhounds,\r\n\r\nHie away, hie away,\r\nOver bank and over brae,\r\nWhere the copsewood is the greenest,\r\nWhere the fountains glisten sheenest,\r\nWhere the lady-fern grows strongest,\r\nWhere the morning dew lies longest,\r\nWhere the black-cock sweetest sips it,\r\nWhere the fairy latest trips it.\r\nHie to haunts right seldom seen,\r\nLovely, lonesome, cool, and green,\r\nOver bank and over brae,\r\nHie away, hie away.\r\n\r\n\r\n“Do the verses he sings,” asked Waverley, “belong to old Scottish\r\npoetry, Miss Bradwardine?”\r\n\r\n“I believe not,” she replied. “This poor creature had a brother, and\r\nHeaven, as if to compensate to the family Davie’s deficiencies, had\r\ngiven him what the hamlet thought uncommon talents. An uncle contrived\r\nto educate him for the Scottish kirk, but he could not get preferment\r\nbecause he came from our _ground_. He returned from college hopeless\r\nand brokenhearted, and fell into a decline. My father supported him\r\ntill his death, which happened before he was nineteen. He played\r\nbeautifully on the flute, and was supposed to have a great turn for\r\npoetry. He was affectionate and compassionate to his brother, who\r\nfollowed him like his shadow, and we think that from him Davie gathered\r\nmany fragments of songs and music unlike those of this country. But if\r\nwe ask him where he got such a fragment as he is now singing, he either\r\nanswers with wild and long fits of laughter, or else breaks into tears\r\nof lamentation; but was never heard to give any explanation, or to\r\nmention his brother’s name since his death.”\r\n\r\n“Surely,” said Edward, who was readily interested by a tale bordering\r\non the romantic, “surely more might be learned by more particular\r\ninquiry.”\r\n\r\n“Perhaps so,” answered Rose; “but my father will not permit any one to\r\npractise on his feelings on this subject.”\r\n\r\nBy this time the Baron, with the help of Mr. Saunderson, had indued a\r\npair of jack-boots of large dimensions, and now invited our hero to\r\nfollow him as he stalked clattering down the ample stair-case, tapping\r\neach huge balustrade as he passed with the butt of his massive\r\nhorse-whip, and humming, with the air of a _chasseur_ of Louis\r\nQuatorze,—\r\n\r\n“Pour la chasse ordonnée il faut preparer tout.\r\nHo la ho! Vite! vite debout!”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIII.\r\nA MORE RATIONAL DAY THAN THE LAST\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Baron of Bradwardine, mounted on an active and well-managed horse,\r\nand seated on a demi-pique saddle, with deep housings to agree with his\r\nlivery, was no bad representative of the old school. His light-coloured\r\nembroidered coat, and superbly barred waistcoat, his brigadier wig,\r\nsurmounted by a small gold-laced cocked-hat, completed his personal\r\ncostume; but he was attended by two well-mounted servants on horseback,\r\narmed with holster-pistols.\r\n\r\nIn this guise he ambled forth over hill and valley, the admiration of\r\nevery farm-yard which they passed in their progress, till, “low down in\r\na grassy vale,” they found David Gellatley leading two very tall deer\r\ngreyhounds, and presiding over half a dozen curs, and about as many\r\nbare-legged and bare-headed boys, who, to procure the chosen\r\ndistinction of attending on the chase, had not failed to tickle his\r\nears with the dulcet appellation of Maister Gellatley, though probably\r\nall and each had hooted him on former occasions in the character of\r\ndaft Davie. But this is no uncommon strain of flattery to persons in\r\noffice, nor altogether confined to the barelegged villagers of\r\nTully-Veolan; it was in fashion Sixty Years Since, is now, and will be\r\nsix hundred years hence, if this admirable compound of folly and\r\nknavery, called the world, shall be then in existence.\r\n\r\nThese “gillie-wet-foots,”[*] as they were called, were destined to beat\r\nthe bushes, which they performed with so much success, that, after half\r\nan hour’s search, a roe was started, coursed, and killed; the Baron\r\nfollowing on his white horse, like Earl Percy of yore, and\r\nmagnanimously flaying and embowelling the slain animal (which, he\r\nobserved, was called by the French _chasseurs, faire la curée_) with\r\nhis own baronial _couteau de chasse_. After this ceremony, he conducted\r\nhis guest homeward by a pleasant and circuitous route, commanding an\r\nextensive prospect of different villages and houses, to each of which\r\nMr. Bradwardine attached some anecdote of history or genealogy, told in\r\nlanguage whimsical from prejudice and pedantry, but often respectable\r\nfor the good sense and honourable feelings which his narrative\r\ndisplayed, and almost always curious, if not valuable, for the\r\ninformation they contained.\r\n\r\n[* A bare-footed Highland lad is called a “gillie-wet-foot.” _Gillie_,\r\nin general, means servant, or attendant.]\r\n\r\n\r\nThe truth is, the ride seemed agreeable to both gentlemen, because they\r\nfound amusement in each other’s conversation, although their characters\r\nand habits of thinking were in many respects totally opposite. Edward,\r\nwe have informed the reader, was warm in his feelings, wild and\r\nromantic in his ideas and in his taste of reading, with a strong\r\ndisposition towards poetry. Mr Bradwardine was the reverse of all this,\r\nand piqued himself upon stalking through life with the same upright,\r\nstarched, stoical gravity which distinguished his evening promenade\r\nupon the terrace of Tully-Veolan, where for hours together—the very\r\nmodel of old Hardyknute—\r\n\r\n“Stately stepp’d he east the wa’,\r\nAnd stately stepp’d he west.”\r\n\r\n\r\nAs for literature, he read the classic poets, to be sure, and the\r\n“Epithalamium” of Georgius Buchanan and Arthur Johnston’s Psalms, of a\r\nSunday; and the “Deliciæ Poetarum Scotorum,” and Sir David Lindsay’s\r\n“Works”, and Barbour’s “Brace”, and Blind Harry’s “Wallace”, and “The\r\nGentle Shepherd”, and “The Cherry and The Slae.”\r\n\r\nBut though he thus far sacrificed his time to the Muses, he would, if\r\nthe truth must be spoken, have been much better pleased had the pious\r\nor sapient apothegms, as well as the historical narratives, which these\r\nvarious works contained, been presented to him in the form of simple\r\nprose. And he sometimes could not refrain from expressing contempt of\r\nthe “vain and unprofitable art of poem-making”, in which, he said, “the\r\nonly one who had excelled in his time was Allan Ramsay, the\r\nperiwigmaker.”[*]\r\n\r\n[* The Baron ought to have remembered that the joyous Allan literally\r\ndrew his blood from the house of the noble earl whom he terms,—\r\n\r\n\r\n“Dalhousie of an old descent\r\nMy stoup, my pride, my ornament.”]\r\n\r\n\r\nBut although Edward and he differed _toto cœlo_, as the Baron would\r\nhave said, upon this subject, yet they met upon history as on a neutral\r\nground, in which each claimed an interest. The Baron, indeed, only\r\ncumbered his memory with matters of fact, the cold, dry, hard outlines\r\nwhich history delineates. Edward, on the contrary, loved to fill up and\r\nround the sketch with the colouring of a warm and vivid imagination,\r\nwhich gives light and life to the actors and speakers in the drama of\r\npast ages. Yet with tastes so opposite, they contributed greatly to\r\neach other’s amusement. Mr. Bradwardine’s minute narratives and\r\npowerful memory supplied to Waverley fresh subjects of the kind upon\r\nwhich his fancy loved to labour, and opened to him a new mine of\r\nincident and of character. And he repaid the pleasure thus communicated\r\nby an earnest attention, valuable to all story-tellers, more especially\r\nto the Baron, who felt his habits of self-respect flattered by it; and\r\nsometimes also by reciprocal communications, which interested Mr.\r\nBradwardine, as confirming or illustrating his own favourite anecdotes.\r\nBesides, Mr. Bradwardine loved to talk of the scenes of his youth,\r\nwhich had been spent in camps and foreign lands, and had many\r\ninteresting particulars to tell of the generals under whom he had\r\nserved and the actions he had witnessed.\r\n\r\nBoth parties returned to Tully-Veolan in great good-humour with each\r\nother; Waverley desirous of studying more attentively what he\r\nconsidered as a singular and interesting character, gifted with a\r\nmemory containing a curious register of ancient and modern anecdotes;\r\nand Bradwardine disposed to regard Edward as _puer_ (or rather\r\n_juvenis_) _bonæ spei et magnæ indolis_, a youth devoid of that\r\npetulant volatility which is impatient of, or vilipends, the\r\nconversation and advice of his seniors, from which he predicted great\r\nthings of his future success and deportment in life. There was no other\r\nguest except Mr. Rubrick, whose information and discourse, as a\r\nclergyman and a scholar, harmonised very well with that of the Baron\r\nand his guest.\r\n\r\nShortly after dinner, the Baron, as if to show that his temperance was\r\nnot entirely theoretical, proposed a visit to Rose’s apartment, or, as\r\nhe termed it, her “troisième étage.” Waverley was accordingly conducted\r\nthrough one or two of those long awkward passages with which ancient\r\narchitects studied to puzzle the inhabitants of the houses which they\r\nplanned, at the end of which Mr. Bradwardine began to ascend, by two\r\nsteps at once, a very steep, narrow, and winding stair, leaving Mr.\r\nRubrick and Waverley to follow at more leisure, while he should\r\nannounce their approach to his daughter.\r\n\r\nAfter having climbed this perpendicular corkscrew until their brains\r\nwere almost giddy, they arrived in a little matted lobby, which served\r\nas an anteroom to Rose’s _sanctum sanctorum_, and through which they\r\nentered her parlour. It was a small, but pleasant apartment, opening to\r\nthe south, and hung with tapestry; adorned besides with two pictures,\r\none of her mother, in the dress of a shepherdess, with a bell-hoop; the\r\nother of the Baron, in his tenth year, in a blue coat, embroidered\r\nwaistcoat, laced hat, and bag-wig, with a bow in his hand. Edward could\r\nnot help smiling at the costume, and at the odd resemblance between the\r\nround, smooth, red-cheeked, staring visage in the portrait, and the\r\ngaunt, bearded, hollow-eyed, swarthy features, which travelling,\r\nfatigues of war, and advanced age, had bestowed on the original. The\r\nBaron joined in the laugh. “Truly,” he said, “that picture was a\r\nwoman’s fantasy of my good mother’s (a daughter of the Laird of\r\nTulliellum, Captain Waverley; I indicated the house to you when we were\r\non the top of the Shinnyheuch; it was burnt by the Dutch auxiliaries\r\nbrought in by the Government in 1715); I never sate for my\r\npourtraicture but once since that was painted, and it was at the\r\nspecial and reiterated request of the Maréchal Duke of Berwick.”\r\n\r\nThe good old gentleman did not mention what Mr. Rubrick afterwards told\r\nEdward, that the Duke had done him this honour on account of his being\r\nthe first to mount the breach of a fort in Savoy during the memorable\r\ncampaign of 1709, and his having there defended himself with his\r\nhalf-pike for nearly ten minutes before any support reached him. To do\r\nthe Baron justice, although sufficiently prone to dwell upon, and even\r\nto exaggerate, his family dignity and consequence, he was too much a\r\nman of real courage ever to allude to such personal acts of merit as he\r\nhad himself manifested.\r\n\r\nMiss Rose now appeared from the interior room of her apartment, to\r\nwelcome her father and his friends. The little labours in which she had\r\nbeen employed obviously showed a natural taste, which required only\r\ncultivation. Her father had taught her French and Italian, and a few of\r\nthe ordinary authors in those languages ornamented her shelves. He had\r\nendeavoured also to be her preceptor in music; but as he began with the\r\nmore abstruse doctrines of the science, and was not perhaps master of\r\nthem himself, she had made no proficiency farther than to be able to\r\naccompany her voice with the harpsichord; but even this was not very\r\ncommon in Scotland at that period. To make amends, she sung with great\r\ntaste and feeling, and with a respect to the sense of what she uttered\r\nthat might be proposed in example to ladies of much superior musical\r\ntalent. Her natural good sense taught her that, if, as we are assured\r\nby high authority, music be “married to immortal verse,” they are very\r\noften divorced by the performer in a most shameful manner. It was\r\nperhaps owing to this sensibility to poetry, and power of combining its\r\nexpression with those of the musical notes, that her singing gave more\r\npleasure to all the unlearned in music, and even to many of the\r\nlearned, than could have been communicated by a much finer voice and\r\nmore brilliant execution unguided by the same delicacy of feeling.\r\n\r\nA bartizan, or projecting gallery, before the windows of her parlour,\r\nserved to illustrate another of Rose’s pursuits; for it was crowded\r\nwith flowers of different kinds, which she had taken under her special\r\nprotection. A projecting turret gave access to this Gothic balcony,\r\nwhich commanded a most beautiful prospect. The formal garden, with its\r\nhigh bounding walls, lay below, contracted, as it seemed, to a mere\r\nparterre; while the view extended beyond them down a wooded glen, where\r\nthe small river was sometimes visible, sometimes hidden in copse. The\r\neye might be delayed by a desire to rest on the rocks, which here and\r\nthere rose from the dell with massive or spiry fronts, or it might\r\ndwell on the noble, though ruined tower, which was here beheld in all\r\nits dignity, frowning from a promontory over the river. To the left\r\nwere seen two or three cottages, a part of the village, the brow of the\r\nhill concealed the others. The glen, or dell, was terminated by a sheet\r\nof water, called Loch Veolan, into which the brook discharged itself,\r\nand which now glistened in the western sun. The distant country seemed\r\nopen and varied in surface, though not wooded; and there was nothing to\r\ninterrupt the view until the scene was bounded by a ridge of distant\r\nand blue hills, which formed the southern boundary of the strath or\r\nvalley. To this pleasant station Miss Bradwardine had ordered coffee.\r\n\r\nThe view of the old tower, or fortalice, introduced some family\r\nanecdotes and tales of Scottish chivalry, which the Baron told with\r\ngreat enthusiasm. The projecting peak of an impending crag which rose\r\nnear it had acquired the name of Saint Swithin’s Chair. It was the\r\nscene of a peculiar superstition, of which Mr. Rubrick mentioned some\r\ncurious particulars, which reminded Waverley of a rhyme quoted by Edgar\r\nin King Lear; and Rose was called upon to sing a little legend, in\r\nwhich they had been interwoven by some village poet,\r\n\r\nWho, noteless as the race from which he sprung,\r\nSaved others’ names, but left his own unsung.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe sweetness of her voice, and the simple beauty of her music, gave\r\nall the advantage which the minstrel could have desired, and which his\r\npoetry so much wanted. I almost doubt if it can be read with patience,\r\ndestitute of these advantages, although I conjecture the following copy\r\nto have been somewhat corrected by Waverley, to suit the taste of those\r\nwho might not relish pure antiquity.\r\n\r\nST. SWITHIN’S CHAIR\r\n\r\n\r\nOn Hallow-Mass Eve, ere ye boune ye to rest,\r\nEver beware that your couch be bless’d;\r\nSign it with cross, and sain it with bead,\r\nSing the Ave, and say the Creed.\r\n\r\nFor on Hallow-Mass Eve the Night-Hag will ride,\r\nAnd all her nine-fold sweeping on by her side,\r\nWhether the wind sing lowly or loud,\r\nSailing through moonshine or swath’d in the cloud.\r\n\r\nThe Lady she sat in Saint Swithin’s Chair,\r\nThe dew of the night has damp’d her hair:\r\nHer cheek was pale; but resolved and high\r\nWas the word of her lip and the glance of her eye.\r\n\r\nShe mutter’d the spell of Swithin bold,\r\nWhen his naked foot traced the midnight wold,\r\nWhen he stopp’d the Hag as she rode the night,\r\nAnd bade her descend, and her promise plight.\r\n\r\nHe that dare sit on Saint Swithin’s Chair,\r\nWhen the Night-Hag wings the troubled air,\r\nQuestions three, when he speaks the spell,\r\nHe may ask, and she must tell.\r\n\r\nThe Baron has been with King Robert his liege\r\nThese three long years in battle and siege;\r\nNews are there none of his weal or his woe,\r\nAnd fain the Lady his fate would know.\r\n\r\nShe shudders and stops as the charm she speaks;—\r\nIs it the moody owl that shrieks?\r\nOr is it that sound, betwixt laughter and scream,\r\nThe voice of the Demon who haunts the stream?\r\n\r\nThe moan of the wind sunk silent and low,\r\nAnd the roaring torrent had ceased to flow;\r\nThe calm was more dreadful than raging storm,\r\nWhen the cold grey mist brought the ghastly Form!\r\n\r\n\r\n“I am sorry to disappoint the company, especially Captain Waverley, who\r\nlistens with such laudable gravity; it is but a fragment, although I\r\nthink there are other verses, describing the return of the Baron from\r\nthe wars, and how the lady was found ‘clay-cold upon the grounsill\r\nledge.’”\r\n\r\n“It is one of those figments,” observed Mr. Bradwardine, “with which\r\nthe early history of distinguished families was deformed in the times\r\nof superstition; as that of Rome, and other ancient nations, had their\r\nprodigies, sir, the which you may read in ancient histories, or in the\r\nlittle work compiled by Julius Obsequens, and inscribed by the learned\r\nScheffer, the editor, to his patron, Benedictus Skytte, Baron of\r\nDudershoff.”\r\n\r\n“My father has a strange defiance of the marvellous, Captain Waverley,”\r\nobserved Rose, “and once stood firm when a whole synod of Presbyterian\r\ndivines were put to the rout by a sudden apparition of the foul fiend.”\r\n\r\nWaverley looked as if desirous to hear more.\r\n\r\n“Must I tell my story as well as sing my song? Well—Once upon a time\r\nthere lived an old woman, called Janet Gellatley, who was suspected to\r\nbe a witch, on the infallible grounds that she was very old, very ugly,\r\nvery poor, and had two sons, one of whom was a poet and the other a\r\nfool, which visitation, all the neighbourhood agreed, had come upon her\r\nfor the sin of witchcraft. And she was imprisoned for a week in the\r\nsteeple of the parish church, and sparely supplied with food, and not\r\npermitted to sleep until she herself became as much persuaded of her\r\nbeing a witch as her accusers; and in this lucid and happy state of\r\nmind was brought forth to make a clean breast, that is, to make open\r\nconfession of her sorceries, before all the Whig gentry and ministers\r\nin the vicinity, who were no conjurors themselves. My father went to\r\nsee fair play between the witch and the clergy; for the witch had been\r\nborn on his estate. And while the witch was confessing that the Enemy\r\nappeared, and made his addresses to her as a handsome black man,—which,\r\nif you could have seen poor old blear-eyed Janet, reflected little\r\nhonour on Apollyon’s taste,—and while the auditors listened with\r\nastonished ears, and the clerk recorded with a trembling hand, she, all\r\nof a sudden, changed the low mumbling tone with which she spoke into a\r\nshrill yell, and exclaimed, “Look to yourselves! look to yourselves! I\r\nsee the Evil One sitting in the midst of ye.” The surprise was general,\r\nand terror and flight its immediate consequences. Happy were those who\r\nwere next the door; and many were the disasters that befell hats,\r\nbands, cuffs, and wigs, before they could get out of the church, where\r\nthey left the obstinate prelatist to settle matters with the witch and\r\nher admirer at his own peril or pleasure.”\r\n\r\n“_Risu solvuntur tabulæ_,” said the Baron; “when they recovered their\r\npanic trepidation they were too much ashamed to bring any wakening of\r\nthe process against Janet Gellatley.”[11]\r\n\r\nThis anecdote led to a long discussion of\r\n\r\nAll those idle thoughts and fantasies,\r\nDevices, dreams, opinions unsound,\r\nShows, visions, soothsays, and prophecies,\r\nAnd all that feigned is, as leasings, tales, and lies.\r\n\r\n\r\nWith such conversation, and the romantic legends which it introduced,\r\nclosed our hero’s second evening in the house of Tully-Veolan.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIV.\r\nA DISCOVERY—WAVERLEY BECOMES DOMESTICATED AT TULLY-VEOLAN\r\n\r\n\r\nThe next day Edward arose betimes, and in a morning walk around the\r\nhouse and its vicinity came suddenly upon a small court in front of the\r\ndog-kennel, where his friend Davie was employed about his four-footed\r\ncharge. One quick glance of his eye recognised Waverley, when,\r\ninstantly turning his back, as if he had not observed him, he began to\r\nsing part of an old ballad:—\r\n\r\n“Young men will love thee more fair and more fast\r\n    (_Heard ye so merry the little bird sing?_);\r\nOld men’s love the longest will last\r\n    (_And the throstle-cock’s head is under his wing_).\r\n\r\n“The young man’s wrath is like light straw on fire\r\n    (_Heard ye so merry the little bird sing?_);\r\nBut like red-hot steel is the old man’s ire,\r\n    (_And the throstle-cock’s head is under his wing_).\r\n\r\n“The young man will brawl at the evening board\r\n    (_Heard ye so merry the little bird sing?_);\r\nBut the old man will draw at the dawning the sword,\r\n    (_And the throstle-cock’s head is under his wing_).”\r\n\r\n\r\nWaverley could not avoid observing that Davie laid something like a\r\nsatirical emphasis on these lines. He therefore approached, and\r\nendeavoured, by sundry queries, to elicit from him what the innuendo\r\nmight mean; but Davie had no mind to explain, and had wit enough to\r\nmake his folly cloak his knavery. Edward could collect nothing from\r\nhim, excepting that the Laird of Balmawhapple had gone home yesterday\r\nmorning “wi’ his boots fu’ o’ bluid.” In the garden, however, he met\r\nthe old butler, who no longer attempted to conceal that, having been\r\nbred in the nursery line with Sumack and Co. of Newcastle, he sometimes\r\nwrought a turn in the flower-borders to oblige the Laird and Miss Rose.\r\nBy a series of queries, Edward at length discovered, with a painful\r\nfeeling of surprise and shame, that Balmawhapple’s submission and\r\napology had been the consequence of a _rencontre_ with the Baron before\r\nhis guest had quitted his pillow, in which the younger combatant had\r\nbeen disarmed and wounded in the sword arm.\r\n\r\nGreatly mortified at this information, Edward sought out his friendly\r\nhost, and anxiously expostulated with him upon the injustice he had\r\ndone him in anticipating his meeting with Mr. Falconer, a circumstance\r\nwhich, considering his youth and the profession of arms which he had\r\njust adopted, was capable of being represented much to his prejudice.\r\nThe Baron justified himself at greater length than I choose to repeat.\r\nHe urged that the quarrel was common to them, and that Balmawhapple\r\ncould not, by the code of honour, _evite_ giving satisfaction to both,\r\nwhich he had done in his case by an honourable meeting, and in that of\r\nEdward by such a _palinode_ as rendered the use of the sword\r\nunnecessary, and which, being made and accepted, must necessarily\r\n_sopite_ the whole affair.\r\n\r\nWith this excuse, or explanation, Waverley was silenced, if not\r\nsatisfied; but he could not help testifying some displeasure against\r\nthe Blessed Bear, which had given rise to the quarrel, nor refrain from\r\nhinting that the sanctified epithet was hardly appropriate. The Baron\r\nobserved, he could not deny that “the Bear, though allowed by heralds\r\nas a most honourable ordinary, had, nevertheless, somewhat fierce,\r\nchurlish, and morose in his disposition (as might be read in Archibald\r\nSimson, pastor of Dalkeith’s “Hieroglyphica Animalium”) and had thus\r\nbeen the type of many quarrels and dissensions which had occurred in\r\nthe house of Bradwardine; of which,” he continued, “I might commemorate\r\nmine own unfortunate dissension with my third cousin by the mother’s\r\nside, Sir Hew Halbert, who was so unthinking as to deride my family\r\nname, as if it had been _quasi Bear-Warden,_ a most uncivil jest, since\r\nit not only insinuated that the founder of our house occupied such a\r\nmean situation as to be a custodier of wild beasts, a charge which, ye\r\nmust have observed, is only entrusted to the very basest plebeians;\r\nbut, moreover, seemed to infer that our coat-armour had not been\r\nachieved by honourable actions in war, but bestowed by way of\r\n_paranomasia_, or pun, upon our family appellation,—a sort of bearing\r\nwhich the French call _armoires parlantes_, the Latins _arma\r\ncantantia_, and your English authorities canting heraldry, being indeed\r\na species of emblazoning more befitting canters, gaberlunzies, and such\r\nlike mendicants, whose gibberish is formed upon playing upon the word,\r\nthan the noble, honourable, and useful science of heraldry, which\r\nassigns armorial bearings as the reward of noble and generous actions,\r\nand not to tickle the ear with vain quodlibets, such as are found in\r\njestbooks.”[12] Of his quarrel with Sir Hew he said nothing more than\r\nthat it was settled in a fitting manner.\r\n\r\nHaving been so minute with respect to the diversions of Tully-Veolan on\r\nthe first days of Edward’s arrival, for the purpose of introducing its\r\ninmates to the reader’s acquaintance, it becomes less necessary to\r\ntrace the progress of his intercourse with the same accuracy. It is\r\nprobable that a young man, accustomed to more cheerful society, would\r\nhave tired of the conversation of so violent an assertor of the “boast\r\nof heraldry” as the Baron; but Edward found an agreeable variety in\r\nthat of Miss Bradwardine, who listened with eagerness to his remarks\r\nupon literature, and showed great justness of taste in her answers. The\r\nsweetness of her disposition had made her submit with complacency, and\r\neven pleasure, to the course of reading prescribed by her father,\r\nalthough it not only comprehended several heavy folios of history, but\r\ncertain gigantic tomes in high-church polemics. In heraldry he was\r\nfortunately contented to give her only such a slight tincture as might\r\nbe acquired by perusal of the two folio volumes of Nisbet. Rose was\r\nindeed the very apple of her father’s eye. Her constant liveliness, her\r\nattention to all those little observances most gratifying to those who\r\nwould never think of exacting them, her beauty, in which he recalled\r\nthe features of his beloved wife, her unfeigned piety, and the noble\r\ngenerosity of her disposition, would have justified the affection of\r\nthe most doting father.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nHis anxiety on her behalf did not, however, seem to extend itself in\r\nthat quarter where, according to the general opinion, it is most\r\nefficiently displayed, in labouring, namely, to establish her in life,\r\neither by a large dowry or a wealthy marriage. By an old settlement,\r\nalmost all the landed estates of the Baron went, after his death, to a\r\ndistant relation; and it was supposed that Miss Bradwardine would\r\nremain but slenderly provided for, as the good gentleman’s cash matters\r\nhad been too long under the exclusive charge of Bailie Macwheeble to\r\nadmit of any great expectations from his personal succession. It is\r\ntrue, the said Bailie loved his patron and his patron’s daughter next\r\n(though at an incomparable distance) to himself. He thought it was\r\npossible to set aside the settlement on the male line, and had actually\r\nprocured an opinion to that effect (and, as he boasted, without a fee)\r\nfrom an eminent Scottish counsel, under whose notice he contrived to\r\nbring the point while consulting him regularly on some other business.\r\nBut the Baron would not listen to such a proposal for an instant. On\r\nthe contrary, he used to have a perverse pleasure in boasting that the\r\nbarony of Bradwardine was a male fief, the first charter having been\r\ngiven at that early period when women were not deemed capable to hold a\r\nfeudal grant; because, according to _Les coustusmes de Normandie, c’est\r\nl’homme ki se bast et ki conseille_, or, as is yet more ungallantly\r\nexpressed by other authorities, all of whose barbarous names he\r\ndelighted to quote at full length, because a woman could not serve the\r\nsuperior, or feudal lord, in war, on account of the decorum of her sex,\r\nnor assist him with advice, because of her limited intellect, nor keep\r\nhis counsel, owing to the infirmity of her disposition. He would\r\ntriumphantly ask, how it would become a female, and that female a\r\nBradwardine, to be seen employed _in servitio exuendi, seu detrahendi,\r\ncaligas regis post battaliam?_ that is, in pulling off the king’s boots\r\nafter an engagement, which was the feudal service by which he held the\r\nbarony of Bradwardine. “No,” he said, “beyond hesitation, _procul\r\ndubio_, many females, as worthy as Rose, had been excluded, in order to\r\nmake way for my own succession, and Heaven forbid that I should do\r\naught that might contravene the destination of my forefathers, or\r\nimpinge upon the right of my kinsman, Malcolm Bradwardine of\r\nInchgrabbit, an honourable, though decayed branch of my own family.”\r\n\r\nThe Bailie, as prime minister, having received this decisive\r\ncommunication from his sovereign, durst not press his own opinion any\r\nfarther, but contented himself with deploring, on all suitable\r\noccasions, to Saunderson, the minister of the interior, the laird’s\r\nself-willedness, and with laying plans for uniting Rose with the young\r\nLaird of Balmawhapple, who had a fine estate, only moderately burdened,\r\nand was a faultless young gentleman, being as sober as a saint—if you\r\nkeep brandy from him and him from brandy—and who, in brief, had no\r\nimperfection but that of keeping light company at a time; such as\r\nJinker, the horse-couper, and Gibby Gaethroughwi’t, the piper o’ Cupar;\r\n“o’ whilk follies, Mr. Saunderson, he’ll mend, he’ll mend,” pronounced\r\nthe Bailie.\r\n\r\n“Like sour ale in simmer,” added Davie Gellatley, who happened to be\r\nnearer the conclave than they were aware of.\r\n\r\nMiss Bradwardine, such as we have described her, with all the\r\nsimplicity and curiosity of a recluse, attached herself to the\r\nopportunities of increasing her store of literature which Edward’s\r\nvisit afforded her. He sent for some of his books from his quarters,\r\nand they opened to her sources of delight of which she had hitherto had\r\nno idea. The best English poets, of every description, and other works\r\non belles-lettres, made a part of this precious cargo. Her music, even\r\nher flowers, were neglected, and Saunders not only mourned over, but\r\nbegan to mutiny against, the labour for which he now scarce received\r\nthanks. These new pleasures became gradually enhanced by sharing them\r\nwith one of a kindred taste. Edward’s readiness to comment, to recite,\r\nto explain difficult passages, rendered his assistance invaluable; and\r\nthe wild romance of his spirit delighted a character too young and\r\ninexperienced to observe its deficiencies. Upon subjects which\r\ninterested him, and when quite at ease, he possessed that flow of\r\nnatural, and somewhat florid eloquence, which has been supposed as\r\npowerful even as figure, fashion, fame, or fortune, in winning the\r\nfemale heart. There was, therefore, an increasing danger in this\r\nconstant intercourse to poor Rose’s peace of mind, which was the more\r\nimminent as her father was greatly too much abstracted in his studies,\r\nand wrapped up in his own dignity, to dream of his daughter’s incurring\r\nit. The daughters of the house of Bradwardine were, in his opinion,\r\nlike those of the house of Bourbon or Austria, placed high above the\r\nclouds of passion which might obfuscate the intellects of meaner\r\nfemales; they moved in another sphere, were governed by other feelings,\r\nand amenable to other rules than those of idle and fantastic affection.\r\nIn short, he shut his eyes so resolutely to the natural consequences of\r\nEdward’s intimacy with Miss Bradwardine, that the whole neighbourhood\r\nconcluded that he had opened them to the advantages of a match between\r\nhis daughter and the wealthy young Englishman, and pronounced him much\r\nless a fool than he had generally shown himself in cases where his own\r\ninterest was concerned.\r\n\r\nIf the Baron, however, had really meditated such an alliance, the\r\nindifference of Waverley would have been an insuperable bar to his\r\nproject. Our hero, since mixing more freely with the world, had learned\r\nto think with great shame and confusion upon his mental legend of Saint\r\nCecilia, and the vexation of these reflections was likely, for some\r\ntime at least, to counterbalance the natural susceptibility of his\r\ndisposition. Besides, Rose Bradwardine, beautiful and amiable as we\r\nhave described her, had not precisely the sort of beauty or merit which\r\ncaptivates a romantic imagination in early youth. She was too frank,\r\ntoo confiding, too kind; amiable qualities, undoubtedly, but\r\ndestructive of the marvellous, with which a youth of imagination\r\ndelights to dress the empress of his affections. Was it possible to\r\nbow, to tremble, and to adore, before the timid, yet playful little\r\ngirl, who now asked Edward to mend her pen, now to construe a stanza in\r\nTasso, and now how to spell a very—very long word in her version of it?\r\nAll these incidents have their fascination on the mind at a certain\r\nperiod of life, but not when a youth is entering it, and rather looking\r\nout for some object whose affection may dignify him in his own eyes\r\nthan stooping to one who looks up to him for such distinction. Hence,\r\nthough there can be no rule in so capricious a passion, early love is\r\nfrequently ambitious in choosing its object; or, which comes to the\r\nsame, selects her (as in the case of Saint Cecilia aforesaid) from a\r\nsituation that gives fair scope for _le beau idéal_, which the reality\r\nof intimate and familiar life rather tends to limit and impair. I knew\r\na very accomplished and sensible young man cured of a violent passion\r\nfor a pretty woman, whose talents were not equal to her face and\r\nfigure, by being permitted to bear her company for a whole afternoon.\r\nThus, it is certain, that had Edward enjoyed such an opportunity of\r\nconversing with Miss Stubbs, Aunt Rachel’s precaution would have been\r\nunnecessary, for he would as soon have fallen in love with the\r\ndairy-maid. And although Miss Bradwardine was a very different\r\ncharacter, it seems probable that the very intimacy of their\r\nintercourse prevented his feeling for her other sentiments than those\r\nof a brother for an amiable and accomplished sister; while the\r\nsentiments of poor Rose were gradually, and without her being\r\nconscious, assuming a shade of warmer affection.\r\n\r\nI ought to have said that Edward, when he sent to Dundee for the books\r\nbefore mentioned, had applied for, and received permission, extending\r\nhis leave of absence. But the letter of his commanding officer\r\ncontained a friendly recommendation to him not to spend his time\r\nexclusively with persons who, estimable as they might be in a general\r\nsense, could not be supposed well affected to a government which they\r\ndeclined to acknowledge by taking the oath of allegiance. The letter\r\nfurther insinuated, though with great delicacy, that although some\r\nfamily connections might be supposed to render it necessary for Captain\r\nWaverley to communicate with gentlemen who were in this unpleasant\r\nstate of suspicion, yet his father’s situation and wishes ought to\r\nprevent his prolonging those attentions into exclusive intimacy. And it\r\nwas intimated, that, while his political principles were endangered by\r\ncommunicating with laymen of this description, he might also receive\r\nerroneous impressions in religion from the prelatic clergy, who so\r\nperversely laboured to set up the royal prerogative in things sacred.\r\n\r\nThis last insinuation probably induced Waverley to set both down to the\r\nprejudices of his commanding officer. He was sensible that Mr.\r\nBradwardine had acted with the most scrupulous delicacy, in never\r\nentering upon any discussion that had the most remote tendency to bias\r\nhis mind in political opinions, although he was himself not only a\r\ndecided partisan of the exiled family, but had been trusted at\r\ndifferent times with important commissions for their service. Sensible,\r\ntherefore, that there was no risk of his being perverted from his\r\nallegiance, Edward felt as if he should do his uncle’s old friend\r\ninjustice in removing from a house where he gave and received pleasure\r\nand amusement, merely to gratify a prejudiced and ill-judged suspicion.\r\nHe therefore wrote a very general answer, assuring his commanding\r\nofficer that his loyalty was not in the most distant danger of\r\ncontamination, and continued an honoured guest and inmate of the house\r\nof Tully-Veolan.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XV.\r\nA CREAGH, AND ITS CONSEQUENCES\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen Edward had been a guest at Tully-Veolan nearly six weeks, he\r\ndescried, one morning, as he took his usual walk before the breakfast\r\nhour, signs of uncommon perturbation in the family. Four bare-legged\r\ndairy-maids, with each an empty milk-pail in her hand, ran about with\r\nfrantic gestures, and uttering loud exclamations of surprise, grief,\r\nand resentment. From their appearance, a pagan might have conceived\r\nthem a detachment of the celebrated Belides, just come from their\r\nbaling penance. As nothing was to be got from this distracted chorus,\r\nexcepting “Lord guide us!” and “Eh sirs!” ejaculations which threw no\r\nlight upon the cause of their dismay, Waverley repaired to the\r\nfore-court, as it was called, where he beheld Bailie Macwheeble\r\ncantering his white pony down the avenue with all the speed it could\r\nmuster. He had arrived, it would seem, upon a hasty summons, and was\r\nfollowed by half a score of peasants from the village who had no great\r\ndifficulty in keeping pace with him.\r\n\r\nThe Bailie, greatly too busy and too important to enter into\r\nexplanations with Edward, summoned forth Mr. Saunderson, who appeared\r\nwith a countenance in which dismay was mingled with solemnity, and they\r\nimmediately entered into close conference. Davie Gellatley was also\r\nseen in the group, idle as Diogenes at Sinope while his countrymen were\r\npreparing for a siege. His spirits always rose with anything, good or\r\nbad, which occasioned tumult, and he continued frisking, hopping,\r\ndancing, and singing the burden of an old ballad,—\r\n\r\n“Our gear’s a’ gane,”\r\n\r\n\r\nuntil, happening to pass too near the Bailie, he received an admonitory\r\nhint from his horse-whip, which converted his songs into lamentation.\r\n\r\nPassing from thence towards the garden, Waverley beheld the Baron in\r\nperson, measuring and re-measuring, with swift and tremendous strides,\r\nthe length of the terrace; his countenance clouded with offended pride\r\nand indignation, and the whole of his demeanour such as seemed to\r\nindicate, that any inquiry concerning the cause of his discomposure\r\nwould give pain at least, if not offence. Waverley therefore glided\r\ninto the house, without addressing him, and took his way to the\r\nbreakfast-parlour, where he found his young friend Rose, who, though\r\nshe neither exhibited the resentment of her father, the turbid\r\nimportance of Bailie Macwheeble, nor the despair of the handmaidens,\r\nseemed vexed and thoughtful. A single word explained the mystery. “Your\r\nbreakfast will be a disturbed one, Captain Waverley. A party of\r\nCaterans have come down upon us last night, and have driven off all our\r\nmilch cows.”\r\n\r\n“A party of Caterans?”\r\n\r\n“Yes; robbers from the neighbouring Highlands. We used to be quite free\r\nfrom them while we paid blackmail to Fergus Mac-Ivor Vich Ian Vohr; but\r\nmy father thought it unworthy of his rank and birth to pay it any\r\nlonger, and so this disaster has happened. It is not the value of the\r\ncattle, Captain Waverley, that vexes me; but my father is so much hurt\r\nat the affront, and is so bold and hot, that I fear he will try to\r\nrecover them by the strong hand; and if he is not hurt himself, he will\r\nhurt some of these wild people, and then there will be no peace between\r\nthem and us perhaps for our life-time; and we cannot defend ourselves\r\nas in old times, for the government have taken all our arms; and my\r\ndear father is so rash—O what will become of us!”—Here poor Rose lost\r\nheart altogether, and burst into a flood of tears.\r\n\r\nThe Baron entered at this moment, and rebuked her with more asperity\r\nthan Waverley had ever heard him use to any one. “Was it not a shame,”\r\nhe said, “that she should exhibit herself before any gentleman in such\r\na light, as if she shed tears for a drove of horned nolt and milch\r\nkine, like the daughter of a Cheshire yeoman!—Captain Waverley, I must\r\nrequest your favourable construction of her grief, which may, or ought\r\nto proceed, solely from seeing her father’s estate exposed to spulzie\r\nand depredation from common thieves and sornars, while we are not\r\nallowed to keep half a score of muskets, whether for defence or\r\nrescue.”\r\n\r\nBailie Macwheeble entered immediately afterwards, and by his report of\r\narms and ammunition confirmed this statement, informing the Baron, in a\r\nmelancholy voice, that though the people would certainly obey his\r\nhonour’s orders, yet there was no chance of their following the gear to\r\nony guid purpose, in respect there were only his honour’s body servants\r\nwho had swords and pistols, and the depredators were twelve\r\nHighlanders, completely armed after the manner of their country. Having\r\ndelivered this doleful annunciation, he assumed a posture of silent\r\ndejection, shaking his head slowly with the motion of a pendulum when\r\nit is ceasing to vibrate, and then remained stationary, his body\r\nstooping at a more acute angle than usual, and the latter part of his\r\nperson projecting in proportion.\r\n\r\nThe Baron, meanwhile, paced the room in silent indignation, and at\r\nlength fixing his eye upon an old portrait, whose person was clad in\r\narmour, and whose features glared grimly out of a huge bush of hair,\r\npart of which descended from his head to his shoulders, and part from\r\nhis chin and upper-lip to his breast-plate,—“That gentleman, Captain\r\nWaverley, my grandsire,” he said, “with two hundred horse,—whom he\r\nlevied within his own bounds, discomfited and put to the rout more than\r\nfive hundred of these Highland reivers, who have been ever _lapis\r\noffensionis et petra scandali_, a stumbling-block and a rock of\r\noffence, to the Lowland vicinage—he discomfited them, I say, when they\r\nhad the temerity to descend to harry this country, in the time of the\r\ncivil dissensions, in the year of grace sixteen hundred forty and two.\r\nAnd now, sir, I, his grandson, am thus used at such unworthy hands.”\r\n\r\nHere there was an awful pause; after which all the company, as is usual\r\nin cases of difficulty, began to give separate and inconsistent\r\ncounsel. Alexander ab Alexandro proposed they should send some one to\r\ncompound with the Caterans, who would readily, he said, give up their\r\nprey for a dollar a head. The Bailie opined that this transaction would\r\namount to theft-boot, or composition of felony; and he recommended that\r\nsome _canny hand_ should be sent up to the glens to make the best\r\nbargain he could, as it were for himself, so that the Laird might not\r\nbe seen in such a transaction. Edward proposed to send off to the\r\nnearest garrison for a party of soldiers and a magistrate’s warrant;\r\nand Rose, as far as she dared, endeavoured to insinuate the course of\r\npaying the arrears of tribute money to Fergus Mac-Ivor Vich Ian Vohr,\r\nwho, they all knew, could easily procure restoration of the cattle, if\r\nhe were properly propitiated.\r\n\r\nNone of these proposals met the Baron’s approbation. The idea of\r\ncomposition, direct or implied, was absolutely ignominious; that of\r\nWaverley only showed that he did not understand the state of the\r\ncountry, and of the political parties which divided it; and, standing\r\nmatters as they did with Fergus Mac-Ivor Vich Ian Vohr, the Baron would\r\nmake no concession to him, were it, he said, “to procure restitution\r\n_in integrum_ of every stirk and stot that the chief, his forefathers,\r\nand his clan, had stolen since the days of Malcolm Canmore.”\r\n\r\nIn fact his voice was still for war, and he proposed to send expresses\r\nto Balmawhapple, Killancureit, Tulliellum, and other lairds, who were\r\nexposed to similar depredations, inviting them to join in the pursuit;\r\n“and then, sir, shall these _nebulones nequissimi_, as Leslæus calls\r\nthem, be brought to the fate of their predecessor Cacus,\r\n\r\n“Elisos oculos, et siccum sanguine guttur.”\r\n\r\n\r\nThe bailie, who by no means relished these warlike counsels, here\r\npulled forth an immense watch, of the colour, and nearly of the size,\r\nof a pewter warming-pan, and observed it was now past noon, and that\r\nthe Caterans had been seen in the pass of Ballybrough soon after\r\nsunrise; so that, before the allied forces could assemble, they and\r\ntheir prey would be far beyond the reach of the most active pursuit,\r\nand sheltered in those pathless deserts, where it was neither advisable\r\nto follow, nor indeed possible to trace them.\r\n\r\nThis proposition was undeniable. The council therefore broke up without\r\ncoming to any conclusion, as has occurred to councils of more\r\nimportance; only it was determined that the Bailie should send his own\r\nthree milkcows down to the mains for the use of the Baron’s family, and\r\nbrew small ale, as a substitute for milk, in his own. To this\r\narrangement, which was suggested by Saunderson, the Bailie readily\r\nassented, both from habitual deference to the family, and an internal\r\nconsciousness that his courtesy would, in some mode or other, be repaid\r\ntenfold.\r\n\r\nThe Baron having also retired to give some necessary directions,\r\nWaverley seized the opportunity to ask, whether this Fergus, with the\r\nunpronounceable name, was the chief thief-taker of the district?\r\n\r\n“Thief-taker!” answered Rose, laughing; “he is a gentleman of great\r\nhonour and consequence, the chieftain of an independent branch of a\r\npowerful Highland clan, and is much respected, both for his own power\r\nand that of his kith, kin, and allies.”\r\n\r\n“And what has he to do with the thieves, then? Is he a magistrate, or\r\nin the commission of the peace?” asked Waverley.\r\n\r\n“The commission of war rather, if there be such a thing,” said Rose;\r\n“for he is a very unquiet neighbour to his unfriends, and keeps a\r\ngreater _following_ on foot than many that have thrice his estate. As\r\nto his connection with the thieves, that I cannot well explain; but the\r\nboldest of them will never steal a hoof from any one that pays\r\nblack-mail to Vich Ian Vohr.”\r\n\r\n“And what is black-mail?”\r\n\r\n“A sort of protection-money that Low-Country gentlemen and heritors,\r\nlying near the Highlands, pay to some Highland chief, that he may\r\nneither do them harm himself, nor suffer it to be done to them by\r\nothers; and then if your cattle are stolen, you have only to send him\r\nword, and he will recover them; or it may be, he will drive away cows\r\nfrom some distant place, where he has a quarrel, and give them to you\r\nto make up your loss.”\r\n\r\n“And is this sort of Highland Jonathan Wild admitted into society, and\r\ncalled a gentleman?”\r\n\r\n“So much so,” said Rose, “that the quarrel between my father and Fergus\r\nMac-Ivor began at a county meeting, where he wanted to take precedence\r\nof all the Lowland gentlemen then present, only my father would not\r\nsuffer it. And then he upbraided my father that he was under his\r\nbanner, and paid him tribute; and my father was in a towering passion,\r\nfor Bailie Macwheeble, who manages such things his own way, had\r\ncontrived to keep this black-mail a secret from him, and passed it in\r\nhis account for cess-money. And they would have fought; but Fergus\r\nMac-Ivor said, very gallantly, he would never raise his hand against a\r\ngrey head that was so much respected as my father’s.—O I wish, I wish\r\nthey had continued friends!”\r\n\r\n“And did you ever see this Mr. Mac-Ivor, if that be his name, Miss\r\nBradwardine?”\r\n\r\n“No, that is not his name; and he would consider _master_ as a sort of\r\naffront, only that you are an Englishman, and know no better. But the\r\nLowlanders call him, like other gentlemen, by the name of his estate,\r\nGlennaquoich; and the Highlanders call him Vich Ian Vohr, that is, the\r\nson of John the Great; and we upon the braes here call him by both\r\nnames indifferently.”\r\n\r\n“I am afraid I shall never bring my English tongue to call him by\r\neither one or other.”\r\n\r\n“But he is a very polite, handsome man,” continued Rose; “and his\r\nsister Flora is one of the most beautiful and accomplished young ladies\r\nin this country; she was bred in a convent in France, and was a great\r\nfriend of mine before this unhappy dispute. Dear Captain Waverley, try\r\nyour influence with my father to make matters up. I am sure this is but\r\nthe beginning of our troubles; for Tully-Veolan has never been a safe\r\nor quiet residence when we have been at feud with the Highlanders. When\r\nI was a girl about ten, there was a skirmish fought between a party of\r\ntwenty of them and my father and his servants behind the mains; and the\r\nbullets broke several panes in the north windows, they were so near.\r\nThree of the Highlanders were killed, and they brought them in wrapped\r\nin their plaids, and laid them on the stone floor of the hall; and next\r\nmorning, their wives and daughters came, clapping their hands, and\r\ncrying the coronach, and shrieking, and carried away the dead bodies,\r\nwith the pipes playing before them. I could not sleep for six weeks\r\nwithout starting and thinking I heard these terrible cries, and saw the\r\nbodies lying on the steps, all stiff and swathed up in their bloody\r\ntartans. But since that time there came a party from the garrison at\r\nStirling, with a warrant from the Lord Justice Clerk, or some such\r\ngreat man, and took away all our arms; and now, how are we to protect\r\nourselves if they come down in any strength?”\r\n\r\nWaverley could not help starting at a story which bore so much\r\nresemblance to one of his own day-dreams. Here was a girl scarce\r\nseventeen, the gentlest of her sex, both in temper and appearance, who\r\nhad witnessed with her own eyes such a scene as he had used to conjure\r\nup in his imagination, as only occurring in ancient times, and spoke of\r\nit coolly, as one very likely to recur. He felt at once the impulse of\r\ncuriosity, and that slight sense of danger which only serves to\r\nheighten its interest. He might have said with Malvolio, ““I do not now\r\nfool myself, to let imagination jade me!” I am actually in the land of\r\nmilitary and romantic adventures, and it only remains to be seen what\r\nwill be my own share in them.”\r\n\r\nThe whole circumstances now detailed concerning the state of the\r\ncountry seemed equally novel and extraordinary. He had indeed often\r\nheard of Highland thieves, but had no idea of the systematic mode in\r\nwhich their depredations were conducted; and that the practice was\r\nconnived at, and even encouraged, by many of the Highland chieftains,\r\nwho not only found the creaghs, or forays, useful for the purpose of\r\ntraining individuals of their clan to the practice of arms, but also of\r\nmaintaining a wholesome terror among their Lowland neighbours, and\r\nlevying, as we have seen, a tribute from them, under colour of\r\nprotection-money.\r\n\r\nBailie Macwheeble, who soon afterwards entered, expatiated still more\r\nat length upon the same topic. This honest gentleman’s conversation was\r\nso formed upon his professional practice, that Davie Gellatley once\r\nsaid his discourse was like a “charge of horning.” He assured our hero,\r\nthat “from the maist ancient times of record, the lawless thieves,\r\nlimmers, and broken men of the Highlands, had been in fellowship\r\ntogether by reason of their surnames, for the committing of divers\r\nthefts, reifs, and herships upon the honest men of the Low Country,\r\nwhen they not only intromitted with their whole goods and gear, corn,\r\ncattle, horse, nolt, sheep, outsight and insight plenishing, at their\r\nwicked pleasure, but moreover made prisoners, ransomed them, or\r\nconcussed them into giving borrows (pledges) to enter into captivity\r\nagain;—all which was directly prohibited in divers parts of the Statute\r\nBook, both by the act one thousand five hundred and sixty-seven, and\r\nvarious others; the whilk statutes, with all that had followed and\r\nmight follow thereupon, were shamefully broken and vilipended by the\r\nsaid sorners, limmers, and broken men, associated into fellowships, for\r\nthe aforesaid purposes of theft, stouthreef, fire-raising, murther,\r\n_raptus mulierum_, or forcible abduction of women, and such like as\r\naforesaid.”\r\n\r\nIt seemed like a dream to Waverley that these deeds of violence should\r\nbe familiar to men’s minds, and currently talked of as falling within\r\nthe common order of things, and happening daily in the immediate\r\nvicinity, without his having crossed the seas, and while he was yet in\r\nthe otherwise well-ordered island of Great Britain.[13]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVI.\r\nAN UNEXPECTED ALLY APPEARS\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Baron returned at the dinner-hour, and had in a great measure\r\nrecovered his composure and good-humour. He not only confirmed the\r\nstories which Edward had heard from Rose and Bailie Macwheeble, but\r\nadded many anecdotes from his own experience, concerning the state of\r\nthe Highlands and their inhabitants. The chiefs he pronounced to be, in\r\ngeneral, gentlemen of great honour and high pedigree, whose word was\r\naccounted as a law by all those of their own sept, or clan. “It did not\r\nindeed,” he said, “become them, as had occurred in late instances, to\r\npropone their _prosapia_, a lineage which rested for the most part on\r\nthe vain and fond rhymes of their seannachies or bhairds, as\r\næquiponderate with the evidence of ancient charters and royal grants of\r\nantiquity, conferred upon distinguished houses in the Low Country by\r\ndivers Scottish monarchs; nevertheless, such was their _outrecuidance_\r\nand presumption, as to undervalue those who possessed such evidents, as\r\nif they held their lands in a sheep’s skin.”\r\n\r\nThis, by the way, pretty well explained the cause of quarrel between\r\nthe Baron and his Highland ally. But he went on to state so many\r\ncurious particulars concerning the manners, customs, and habits of this\r\npatriarchal race that Edward’s curiosity became highly interested, and\r\nhe inquired whether it was possible to make with safety an excursion\r\ninto the neighbouring Highlands, whose dusky barrier of mountains had\r\nalready excited his wish to penetrate beyond them. The Baron assured\r\nhis guest that nothing would be more easy, providing this quarrel were\r\nfirst made up, since he could himself give him letters to many of the\r\ndistinguished chiefs, who would receive him with the utmost courtesy\r\nand hospitality.\r\n\r\nWhile they were on this topic, the door suddenly opened, and, ushered\r\nby Saunders Saunderson, a Highlander, fully armed and equipped, entered\r\nthe apartment. Had it not been that Saunders acted the part of master\r\nof the ceremonies to this martial apparition, without appearing to\r\ndeviate from his usual composure, and that neither Mr. Bradwardine nor\r\nRose exhibited any emotion, Edward would certainly have thought the\r\nintrusion hostile. As it was, he started at the sight of what he had\r\nnot yet happened to see, a mountaineer in his full national costume.\r\nThe individual Gael was a stout, dark, young man, of low stature, the\r\nample folds of whose plaid added to the appearance of strength which\r\nhis person exhibited. The short kilt, or petticoat, showed his sinewy\r\nand clean-made limbs; the goatskin purse, flanked by the usual\r\ndefences, a dirk and steel-wrought pistol, hung before him; his bonnet\r\nhad a short feather, which indicated his claim to be treated as a\r\n_duinhé-wassel_, or sort of gentleman; a broadsword dangled by his\r\nside, a target hung upon his shoulder, and a long Spanish fowling-piece\r\noccupied one of his hands. With the other hand he pulled off his\r\nbonnet, and the Baron, who well knew their customs, and the proper mode\r\nof addressing them, immediately said, with an air of dignity, but\r\nwithout rising, and much, as Edward thought, in the manner of a prince\r\nreceiving an embassy, “Welcome, Evan Dhu Maccombich; what news from\r\nFergus Mac-Ivor Vich Ian Vohr?”\r\n\r\n“Fergus Mac-Ivor Vich Ian Vohr,” said the ambassador, in good English,\r\n“greets you well, Baron of Bradwardine and Tully-Veolan, and is sorry\r\nthere has been a thick cloud interposed between you and him, which has\r\nkept you from seeing and considering the friendship and alliances that\r\nhave been between your houses and forebears of old; and he prays you\r\nthat the cloud may pass away, and that things may be as they have been\r\nheretofore between the clan Ivor and the house of Bradwardine, when\r\nthere was an egg between them for a flint and a knife for a sword. And\r\nhe expects you will also say, you are sorry for the cloud, and no man\r\nshall hereafter ask whether it descended from the hill to the valley,\r\nor rose from the valley to the hill; for they never struck with the\r\nscabbard who did not receive with the sword, and woe to him who would\r\nlose his friend for the stormy cloud of a spring morning.”\r\n\r\nTo this the Baron of Bradwardine answered with suitable dignity, that\r\nhe knew the chief of Clan Ivor to be a well-wisher to the _king_, and\r\nhe was sorry there should have been a cloud between him and any\r\ngentleman of such sound principles, “for when folks are banding\r\ntogether, feeble is he who hath no brother.”\r\n\r\nThis appearing perfectly satisfactory, that the peace between these\r\naugust persons might be duly solemnised, the Baron ordered a stoup of\r\nusquebaugh, and, filling a glass, drank to the health and prosperity of\r\nMac-Ivor of Glennaquoich; upon which the Celtic ambassador, to requite\r\nhis politeness, turned down a mighty bumper of the same generous\r\nliquor, seasoned with his good wishes to the house of Bradwardine.\r\n\r\nHaving thus ratified the preliminaries of the general treaty of\r\npacification, the envoy retired to adjust with Mr. Macwheeble some\r\nsubordinate articles with which it was not thought necessary to trouble\r\nthe Baron. These probably referred to the discontinuance of the\r\nsubsidy, and apparently the Bailie found means to satisfy their ally,\r\nwithout suffering his master to suppose that his dignity was\r\ncompromised. At least, it is certain, that after the plenipotentiaries\r\nhad drunk a bottle of brandy in single drams, which seemed to have no\r\nmore effect upon such seasoned vessels than if it had been poured upon\r\nthe two bears at the top of the avenue, Evan Dhu Maccombich, having\r\npossessed himself of all the information which he could procure\r\nrespecting the robbery of the preceding night, declared his intention\r\nto set off immediately in pursuit of the cattle, which he pronounced to\r\nbe “no that far off; they have broken the bone,” he observed, “but they\r\nhave had no time to suck the marrow.”\r\n\r\nOur hero, who had attended Evan Dhu during his perquisitions, was much\r\nstruck with the ingenuity which he displayed in collecting information,\r\nand the precise and pointed conclusions which he drew from it. Evan\r\nDhu, on his part, was obviously flattered with the attention of\r\nWaverley, the interest he seemed to take in his inquiries, and his\r\ncuriosity about the customs and scenery of the Highlands. Without much\r\nceremony he invited Edward to accompany him on a short walk of ten or\r\nfifteen miles into the mountains, and see the place where the cattle\r\nwere conveyed to; adding, “If it be as I suppose, you never saw such a\r\nplace in your life, nor ever will, unless you go with me or the like of\r\nme.”\r\n\r\nOur hero, feeling his curiosity considerably excited by the idea of\r\nvisiting the den of a Highland Cacus, took, however, the precaution to\r\ninquire if his guide might be trusted. He was assured that the\r\ninvitation would on no account have been given had there been the least\r\ndanger, and that all he had to apprehend was a little fatigue; and, as\r\nEvan proposed he should pass a day at his Chieftain’s house in\r\nreturning, where he would be sure of good accommodation and an\r\nexcellent welcome, there seemed nothing very formidable in the task he\r\nundertook. Rose, indeed, turned pale when she heard of it; but her\r\nfather, who loved the spirited curiosity of his young friend, did not\r\nattempt to damp it by an alarm of danger which really did not exist,\r\nand a knapsack, with a few necessaries, being bound on the shoulders of\r\na sort of deputy gamekeeper, our hero set forth with a fowling-piece in\r\nhis hand, accompanied by his new friend Evan Dhu, and followed by the\r\ngamekeeper aforesaid, and by two wild Highlanders, the attendants of\r\nEvan, one of whom had upon his shoulder a hatchet at the end of a pole,\r\ncalled a Lochaber-axe,[14] and the other a long ducking-gun. Evan, upon\r\nEdward’s inquiry, gave him to understand that this martial escort was\r\nby no means necessary as a guard, but merely, as he said, drawing up\r\nand adjusting his plaid with an air of dignity, that he might appear\r\ndecently at Tully-Veolan, and as Vich Ian Vohr’s foster-brother ought\r\nto do. “Ah!” said he, “if you Saxon _duinhé-wassel_ (English gentleman)\r\nsaw but the Chief with his tail on!”\r\n\r\n“With his tail on?” echoed Edward in some surprise.\r\n\r\n“Yes—that is, with all his usual followers, when he visits those of the\r\nsame rank. There is,” he continued, stopping and drawing himself\r\nproudly up, while he counted upon his fingers the several officers of\r\nhis chief’s retinue; “there is his _hanchman_, or right-hand man; then\r\nhis _bàrd_, or poet; then his _bladier_, or orator, to make harangues\r\nto the great folks whom he visits; then his _gilly-more_, or\r\narmour-bearer, to carry his sword and target, and his gun; then his\r\n_gilly-casfliuch_, who carries him on his back through the sikes and\r\nbrooks; then his _gilly-comstrian_, to lead his horse by the bridle in\r\nsteep and difficult paths; then his _gilly-trushharnish_, to carry his\r\nknapsack; and the piper and the piper’s man, and it may be a dozen\r\nyoung lads beside, that have no business, but are just boys of the\r\nbelt, to follow the Laird and do his honour’s bidding.”\r\n\r\n“And does your Chief regularly maintain all these men?” demanded\r\nWaverley.\r\n\r\n“All these?” replied Evan; “ay, and many a fair head beside, that would\r\nnot ken where to lay itself, but for the mickle barn at Glennaquoich.”\r\n\r\nWith similar tales of the grandeur of the Chief in peace and war, Evan\r\nDhu beguiled the way till they approached more closely those huge\r\nmountains which Edward had hitherto only seen at a distance. It was\r\ntowards evening as they entered one of the tremendous passes which\r\nafford communication between the high and low country; the path, which\r\nwas extremely steep and rugged, winded up a chasm between two\r\ntremendous rocks, following the passage which a foaming stream, that\r\nbrawled far below, appeared to have worn for itself in the course of\r\nages. A few slanting beams of the sun, which was now setting, reached\r\nthe water in its darksome bed, and showed it partially, chafed by a\r\nhundred rocks and broken by a hundred falls. The descent from the path\r\nto the stream was a mere precipice, with here and there a projecting\r\nfragment of granite, or a scathed tree, which had warped its twisted\r\nroots into the fissures of the rock. On the right hand, the mountain\r\nrose above the path with almost equal inaccessibility; but the hill on\r\nthe opposite side displayed a shroud of copsewood, with which some\r\npines were intermingled.\r\n\r\n“This,” said Evan, “is the pass of Bally-Brough, which was kept in\r\nformer times by ten of the clan Donnochie against a hundred of the\r\nLow-Country carles. The graves of the slain are still to be seen in\r\nthat little _corri_, or bottom, on the opposite side of the burn; if\r\nyour eyes are good, you may see the green specks among the heather.\r\nSee, there is an _earn_, which you Southrons call an eagle. You have no\r\nsuch birds as that in England. He is going to fetch his supper from the\r\nLaird of Bradwardine’s braes, but I’ll send a slug after him.”\r\n\r\nHe fired his piece accordingly, but missed the superb monarch of the\r\nfeathered tribes, who, without noticing the attempt to annoy him,\r\ncontinued his majestic flight to the southward. A thousand birds of\r\nprey, hawks, kites, carrion-crows, and ravens, disturbed from the\r\nlodgings which they had just taken up for the evening, rose at the\r\nreport of the gun, and mingled their hoarse and discordant notes with\r\nthe echoes which replied to it, and with the roar of the mountain\r\ncataracts. Evan, a little disconcerted at having missed his mark, when\r\nhe meant to have displayed peculiar dexterity, covered his confusion by\r\nwhistling part of a pibroch as he reloaded his piece, and proceeded in\r\nsilence up the pass.\r\n\r\nIt issued in a narrow glen, between two mountains, both very lofty and\r\ncovered with heath. The brook continued to be their companion, and they\r\nadvanced up its mazes, crossing them now and then, on which occasions\r\nEvan Dhu uniformly offered the assistance of his attendants to carry\r\nover Edward; but our hero, who had been always a tolerable pedestrian,\r\ndeclined the accommodation, and obviously rose in his guide’s opinion,\r\nby showing that he did not fear wetting his feet. Indeed he was\r\nanxious, so far as he could without affectation, to remove the opinion\r\nwhich Evan seemed to entertain of the effeminacy of the Lowlanders, and\r\nparticularly of the English.\r\n\r\nThrough the gorge of this glen they found access to a black bog, of\r\ntremendous extent, full of large pit-holes, which they traversed with\r\ngreat difficulty and some danger, by tracks which no one but a\r\nHighlander could have followed. The path itself, or rather the portion\r\nof more solid ground on which the travellers half walked, half waded,\r\nwas rough, broken, and in many places quaggy and unsound. Sometimes the\r\nground was so completely unsafe that it was necessary to spring from\r\none hillock to another, the space between being incapable of bearing\r\nthe human weight. This was an easy matter to the Highlanders, who wore\r\nthin-soled brogues fit for the purpose, and moved with a peculiar\r\nspringing step; but Edward began to find the exercise, to which he was\r\nunaccustomed, more fatiguing than he expected. The lingering twilight\r\nserved to show them through this Serbonian bog, but deserted them\r\nalmost totally at the bottom of a steep and very stony hill, which it\r\nwas the travellers’ next toilsome task to ascend. The night, however,\r\nwas pleasant, and not dark; and Waverley, calling up mental energy to\r\nsupport personal fatigue, held on his march gallantly, though envying\r\nin his heart his Highland attendants, who continued, without a symptom\r\nof abated vigour, the rapid and swinging pace, or rather trot, which,\r\naccording to his computation, had already brought them fifteen miles\r\nupon their journey.\r\n\r\nAfter crossing this mountain and descending on the other side towards a\r\nthick wood, Evan Dhu held some conference with his Highland attendants,\r\nin consequence of which Edward’s baggage was shifted from the shoulders\r\nof the gamekeeper to those of one of the gillies, and the former was\r\nsent off with the other mountaineer in a direction different from that\r\nof the three remaining travellers. On asking the meaning of this\r\nseparation, Waverley was told that the Lowlander must go to a hamlet\r\nabout three miles off for the night; for unless it was some very\r\nparticular friend, Donald Bean Lean, the worthy person whom they\r\nsupposed to be possessed of the cattle, did not much approve of\r\nstrangers approaching his retreat. This seemed reasonable, and silenced\r\na qualm of suspicion which came across Edward’s mind when he saw\r\nhimself, at such a place and such an hour, deprived of his only Lowland\r\ncompanion. And Evan immediately afterwards added, “that indeed he\r\nhimself had better get forward, and announce their approach to Donald\r\nBean Lean, as the arrival of a _sidier roy_ (red soldier) might\r\notherwise be a disagreeable surprise.” And without waiting for an\r\nanswer, in jockey phrase, he trotted out, and putting himself to a very\r\nround pace, was out of sight in an instant.\r\n\r\nWaverley was now left to his own meditations, for his attendant with\r\nthe battle-axe spoke very little English. They were traversing a thick,\r\nand, as it seemed, an endless wood of pines, and consequently the path\r\nwas altogether indiscernible in the murky darkness which surrounded\r\nthem. The Highlander, however, seemed to trace it by instinct, without\r\nthe hesitation of a moment, and Edward followed his footsteps as close\r\nas he could.\r\n\r\nAfter journeying a considerable time in silence, he could not help\r\nasking, “Was it far to the end of their journey?”\r\n\r\n“Ta cove was tree, four mile; but as _duinhé-wassel_ was a wee taiglit,\r\nDonald could, tat is, might—would—should send ta _curragh_.”\r\n\r\nThis conveyed no information. The _curragh_ which was promised might be\r\na man, a horse, a cart, or chaise; and no more could be got from the\r\nman with the battle-axe but a repetition of “Aich ay! ta _curragh_.”\r\n\r\nBut in a short time Edward began to conceive his meaning, when, issuing\r\nfrom the wood, he found himself on the banks of a large river or lake,\r\nwhere his conductor gave him to understand they must sit down for a\r\nlittle while. The moon, which now began to rise, showed obscurely the\r\nexpanse of water which spread before them, and the shapeless and\r\nindistinct forms of mountains with which it seemed to be surrounded.\r\nThe cool and yet mild air of the summer night refreshed Waverley after\r\nhis rapid and toilsome walk; and the perfume which it wafted from the\r\nbirch trees,[*] bathed in the evening dew, was exquisitely fragrant.\r\n\r\n[* It is not the weeping birch, the most common species in the\r\nHighlands, but the woolly-leaved Lowland birch, that is distinguished\r\nby this fragrance.]\r\n\r\n\r\nHe had now time to give himself up to the full romance of his\r\nsituation. Here he sate on the banks of an unknown lake, under the\r\nguidance of a wild native, whose language was unknown to him, on a\r\nvisit to the den of some renowned outlaw, a second Robin Hood, perhaps,\r\nor Adam o’ Gordon, and that at deep midnight, through scenes of\r\ndifficulty and toil, separated from his attendant, left by his guide.\r\nWhat a variety of incidents for the exercise of a romantic imagination,\r\nand all enhanced by the solemn feeling of uncertainty at least, if not\r\nof danger! The only circumstance which assorted ill with the rest was\r\nthe cause of his journey—the Baron’s milk-cows! this degrading incident\r\nhe kept in the background.\r\n\r\nWhile wrapt in these dreams of imagination, his companion gently\r\ntouched him, and, pointing in a direction nearly straight across the\r\nlake, said, “Yon’s ta cove.” A small point of light was seen to twinkle\r\nin the direction in which he pointed, and, gradually increasing in size\r\nand lustre, seemed to flicker like a meteor upon the verge of the\r\nhorizon. While Edward watched this phenomenon, the distant dash of oars\r\nwas heard. The measured sound approached near and more near, and\r\npresently a loud whistle was heard in the same direction. His friend\r\nwith the battle-axe immediately whistled clear and shrill, in reply to\r\nthe signal, and a boat, manned with four or five Highlanders, pushed\r\nfor a little inlet, near which Edward was sitting. He advanced to meet\r\nthem with his attendant, was immediately assisted into the boat by the\r\nofficious attention of two stout mountaineers, and had no sooner seated\r\nhimself than they resumed their oars, and began to row across the lake\r\nwith great rapidity.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVII.\r\nTHE HOLD OF A HIGHLAND ROBBER\r\n\r\n\r\nThe party preserved silence, interrupted only by the monotonous and\r\nmurmured chant of a Gaelic song, sung in a kind of low recitative by\r\nthe steersman, and by the dash of the oars, which the notes seemed to\r\nregulate, as they dipped to them in cadence. The light, which they now\r\napproached more nearly, assumed a broader, redder and more irregular\r\nsplendour. It appeared plainly to be a large fire, but whether kindled\r\nupon an island or the mainland Edward could not determine. As he saw\r\nit, the red glaring orb seemed to rest on the very surface of the lake\r\nitself, and resembled the fiery vehicle in which the Evil Genius of an\r\nOriental tale traverses land and sea. They approached nearer, and the\r\nlight of the fire sufficed to show that it was kindled at the bottom of\r\na huge dark crag or rock, rising abruptly from the very edge of the\r\nwater; its front, changed by the reflection to dusky red, formed a\r\nstrange and even awful contrast to the banks around, which were from\r\ntime to time faintly and partially illuminated by pallid moonlight.\r\n\r\nThe boat now neared the shore, and Edward could discover that this\r\nlarge fire, amply supplied with branches of pine-wood by two figures,\r\nwho, in the red reflection of its light, appeared like demons, was\r\nkindled in the jaws of a lofty cavern, into which an inlet from the\r\nlake seemed to advance; and he conjectured, which was indeed true, that\r\nthe fire had been lighted as a beacon to the boatmen on their return.\r\nThey rowed right for the mouth of the cave, and then, shifting their\r\noars, permitted the boat to enter in obedience to the impulse which it\r\nhad received. The skiff passed the little point or platform of rock on\r\nwhich the fire was blazing, and running about two boats’ lengths\r\nfarther, stopped where the cavern (for it was already arched overhead)\r\nascended from the water by five or six broad ledges of rock, so easy\r\nand regular that they might be termed natural steps. At this moment a\r\nquantity of water was suddenly flung upon the fire, which sunk with a\r\nhissing noise, and with it disappeared the light it had hitherto\r\nafforded. Four or five active arms lifted Waverley out of the boat,\r\nplaced him on his feet, and almost carried him into the recesses of the\r\ncave. He made a few paces in darkness, guided in this manner; and\r\nadvancing towards a hum of voices, which seemed to sound from the\r\ncentre of the rock, at an acute turn Donald Bean Lean and his whole\r\nestablishment were before his eyes.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nThe interior of the cave, which here rose very high, was illuminated by\r\ntorches made of pine-tree, which emitted a bright and bickering light,\r\nattended by a strong though not unpleasant odour. Their light was\r\nassisted by the red glare of a large charcoal fire, round which were\r\nseated five or six armed Highlanders, while others were indistinctly\r\nseen couched on their plaids in the more remote recesses of the cavern.\r\nIn one large aperture, which the robber facetiously called his “spence”\r\n(or pantry), there hung by the heels the carcasses of a sheep, or ewe,\r\nand two cows lately slaughtered. The principal inhabitant of this\r\nsingular mansion, attended by Evan Dhu as master of the ceremonies,\r\ncame forward to meet his guest, totally different in appearance and\r\nmanner from what his imagination had anticipated. The profession which\r\nhe followed, the wilderness in which he dwelt, the wild warrior forms\r\nthat surrounded him, were all calculated to inspire terror. From such\r\naccompaniments, Waverley prepared himself to meet a stern, gigantic,\r\nferocious figure, such as Salvator would have chosen to be the central\r\nobject of a group of banditti.[15]\r\n\r\nDonald Bean Lean was the very reverse of all these. He was thin in\r\nperson and low in stature, with light sandy-coloured hair, and small\r\npale features, from which he derived his agnomen of “Bean” or white;\r\nand although his form was light, well proportioned and active, he\r\nappeared, on the whole, rather a diminutive and insignificant figure.\r\nHe had served in some inferior capacity in the French army, and in\r\norder to receive his English visitor in great form, and probably\r\nmeaning, in his way, to pay him a compliment, he had laid aside the\r\nHighland dress for the time, to put on an old blue and red uniform and\r\na feathered hat, in which he was far from showing to advantage, and\r\nindeed looked so incongruous, compared with all around him, that\r\nWaverley would have been tempted to laugh, had laughter been either\r\ncivil or safe. The robber received Captain Waverley with a profusion of\r\nFrench politeness and Scottish hospitality, seemed perfectly to know\r\nhis name and connections, and to be particularly acquainted with his\r\nuncle’s political principles. On these he bestowed great applause, to\r\nwhich Waverley judged it prudent to make a very general reply.\r\n\r\nBeing placed at a convenient distance from the charcoal fire, the heat\r\nof which the season rendered oppressive, a strapping Highland damsel\r\nplaced before Waverley, Evan, and Donald Bean three _cogues_, or wooden\r\nvessels composed of staves and hoops, containing _eanaruich_,[*] a sort\r\nof strong soup, made out of a particular part of the inside of the\r\nbeeves. After this refreshment, which, though coarse, fatigue and\r\nhunger rendered palatable, steaks, roasted on the coals, were supplied\r\nin liberal abundance, and disappeared before Evan Dhu and their host\r\nwith a promptitude that seemed like magic, and astonished Waverley, who\r\nwas much puzzled to reconcile their voracity with what he had heard of\r\nthe abstemiousness of the Highlanders. He was ignorant that this\r\nabstinence was with the lower ranks wholly compulsory, and that, like\r\nsome animals of prey, those who practise it were usually gifted with\r\nthe power of indemnifying themselves to good purpose when chance threw\r\nplenty in their way. The whisky came forth in abundance to crown the\r\ncheer. The Highlanders drank it copiously and undiluted; but Edward,\r\nhaving mixed a little with water, did not find it so palatable as to\r\ninvite him to repeat the draught. Their host bewailed himself\r\nexceedingly that he could offer him no wine; had he but known\r\nfour-and-twenty hours before, he would have had some, had it been\r\nwithin the circle of forty miles round him. But no gentleman could do\r\nmore to show his sense of the honour of a visit from another than to\r\noffer him the best cheer his house afforded. Where there are no bushes\r\nthere can be no nuts, and the way of those you live with is that you\r\nmust follow.\r\n\r\n[* This was the regale presented by Rob Roy to the Laird of Tullibody.]\r\n\r\n\r\nHe went on regretting to Evan Dhu the death of an aged man, Donnacha an\r\nAmrigh, or Duncan with the Cap, “a gifted seer,” who foretold, through\r\nthe second sight, visitors of every description who haunted their\r\ndwelling, whether as friends or foes.\r\n\r\n“Is not his son Malcolm _taishatr_ (a second-sighted person)?” asked\r\nEvan.\r\n\r\n“Nothing equal to his father,” replied Donald Bean. “He told us the\r\nother day, we were to see a great gentleman riding on a horse, and\r\nthere came nobody that whole day but Shemus Beg, the blind harper, with\r\nhis dog. Another time he advertised us of a wedding, and behold it\r\nproved a funeral; and on the _creagh_, when he foretold to us we should\r\nbring home a hundred head of horned cattle, we gripped nothing but a\r\nfat bailie of Perth.”\r\n\r\nFrom this discourse he passed to the political and military state of\r\nthe country; and Waverley was astonished, and even alarmed, to find a\r\nperson of this description so accurately acquainted with the strength\r\nof the various garrisons and regiments quartered north of the Tay. He\r\neven mentioned the exact number of recruits who had joined Waverley’s\r\ntroop from his uncle’s estate, and observed they were “pretty men”,\r\nmeaning, not handsome, but stout warlike fellows. He put Waverley in\r\nmind of one or two minute circumstances which had happened at a general\r\nreview of the regiment, which satisfied him that the robber had been an\r\neye-witness of it; and Evan Dhu having by this time retired from the\r\nconversation, and wrapped himself up in his plaid to take some repose,\r\nDonald asked Edward, in a very significant manner, whether he had\r\nnothing particular to say to him.\r\n\r\nWaverley, surprised and somewhat startled at this question from such a\r\ncharacter, answered, he had no motive in visiting him but curiosity to\r\nsee his extraordinary place of residence. Donald Bean Lean looked him\r\nsteadily in the face for an instant, and then said, with a significant\r\nnod, “You might as well have confided in me; I am as much worthy of\r\ntrust as either the Baron of Bradwardine or Vich Ian Vohr. But you are\r\nequally welcome to my house.”\r\n\r\nWaverley felt an involuntary shudder creep over him at the mysterious\r\nlanguage held by this outlawed and lawless bandit, which, in despite of\r\nhis attempts to master it, deprived him of the power to ask the meaning\r\nof his insinuations. A heath pallet, with the flowers stuck uppermost,\r\nhad been prepared for him in a recess of the cave, and here, covered\r\nwith such spare plaids as could be mustered, he lay for some time\r\nwatching the motions of the other inhabitants of the cavern. Small\r\nparties of two or three entered or left the place, without any other\r\nceremony than a few words in Gaelic to the principal outlaw, and, when\r\nhe fell asleep, to a tall Highlander who acted as his lieutenant, and\r\nseemed to keep watch during his repose. Those who entered seemed to\r\nhave returned from some excursion, of which they reported the success,\r\nand went without farther ceremony to the larder, where, cutting with\r\ntheir dirks their rations from the carcasses which were there\r\nsuspended, they proceeded to broil and eat them at their own pleasure\r\nand leisure. The liquor was under strict regulation, being served out\r\neither by Donald himself, his lieutenant, or the strapping Highland\r\ngirl aforesaid, who was the only female that appeared. The allowance of\r\nwhisky, however, would have appeared prodigal to any but Highlanders,\r\nwho, living entirely in the open air and in a very moist climate, can\r\nconsume great quantities of ardent spirits without the usual baneful\r\neffects either upon the brain or constitution.\r\n\r\nAt length the fluctuating groups began to swim before the eyes of our\r\nhero as they gradually closed; nor did he re-open them till the morning\r\nsun was high on the lake without, though there was but a faint and\r\nglimmering twilight in the recesses of Uaimh an Ri, or the King’s\r\nCavern, as the abode of Donald Bean Lean was proudly denominated.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVIII.\r\nWAVERLEY PROCEEDS ON HIS JOURNEY\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen Edward had collected his scattered recollection, he was surprised\r\nto observe the cavern totally deserted. Having arisen and put his dress\r\nin some order, he looked more accurately round him; but all was still\r\nsolitary. If it had not been for the decayed brands of the fire, now\r\nsunk into grey ashes, and the remnants of the festival, consisting of\r\nbones half burnt and half gnawed, and an empty keg or two, there\r\nremained no traces of Donald and his band. When Waverley sallied forth\r\nto the entrance of the cave, he perceived that the point of rock, on\r\nwhich remained the marks of last night’s beacon, was accessible by a\r\nsmall path, either natural or roughly hewn in the rock, along the\r\nlittle inlet of water which ran a few yards up into the cavern, where,\r\nas in a wetdock, the skiff which brought him there the night before was\r\nstill lying moored. When he reached the small projecting platform on\r\nwhich the beacon had been established, he would have believed his\r\nfurther progress by land impossible, only that it was scarce probable\r\nbut what the inhabitants of the cavern had some mode of issuing from it\r\notherwise than by the lake. Accordingly, he soon observed three or four\r\nshelving steps, or ledges of rock, at the very extremity of the little\r\nplatform; and, making use of them as a staircase, he clambered by their\r\nmeans around the projecting shoulder of the crag on which the cavern\r\nopened, and, descending with some difficulty on the other side, he\r\ngained the wild and precipitous shores of a Highland loch, about four\r\nmiles in length and a mile and a half across, surrounded by heathy and\r\nsavage mountains, on the crests of which the morning mist was still\r\nsleeping.\r\n\r\nLooking back to the place from which he came, he could not help\r\nadmiring the address which had adopted a retreat of such seclusion and\r\nsecrecy. The rock, round the shoulder of which he had turned by a few\r\nimperceptible notches, that barely afforded place for the foot, seemed,\r\nin looking back upon it, a huge precipice, which barred all further\r\npassage by the shores of the lake in that direction. There could be no\r\npossibility, the breadth of the lake considered, of descrying the\r\nentrance of the narrow and low-browed cave from the other side; so\r\nthat, unless the retreat had been sought for with boats, or disclosed\r\nby treachery, it might be a safe and secret residence to its garrison\r\nas long as they were supplied with provisions. Having satisfied his\r\ncuriosity in these particulars, Waverley looked around for Evan Dhu and\r\nhis attendants, who, he rightly judged, would be at no great distance,\r\nwhatever might have become of Donald Bean Lean and his party, whose\r\nmode of life was, of course, liable to sudden migrations of abode.\r\nAccordingly, at the distance of about half a mile, he beheld a\r\nHighlander (Evan apparently) angling in the lake, with another\r\nattending him, whom, from the weapon which he shouldered, he recognised\r\nfor his friend with the battle-axe.\r\n\r\nMuch nearer to the mouth of the cave he heard the notes of a lively\r\nGaelic song, guided by which, in a sunny recess, shaded by a glittering\r\nbirch-tree, and carpeted with a bank of firm white sand, he found the\r\ndamsel of the cavern, whose lay had already reached him, busy, to the\r\nbest of her power, in arranging to advantage a morning repast of milk,\r\neggs, barley-bread, fresh butter, and honey-comb. The poor girl had\r\nalready made a circuit of four miles that morning in search of the\r\neggs, of the meal which baked her cakes, and of the other materials of\r\nthe breakfast, being all delicacies which she had to beg or borrow from\r\ndistant cottagers. The followers of Donald Bean Lean used little food\r\nexcept the flesh of the animals which they drove away from the\r\nLowlands; bread itself was a delicacy seldom thought of, because hard\r\nto be obtained, and all the domestic accommodations of milk, poultry,\r\nbutter, etc., were out of the question in this Scythian camp. Yet it\r\nmust not be omitted that, although Alice had occupied a part of the\r\nmorning in providing those accommodations for her guest which the\r\ncavern did not afford, she had secured time also to arrange her own\r\nperson in her best trim. Her finery was very simple. A short\r\nrusset-coloured jacket and a petticoat of scanty longitude was her\r\nwhole dress; but these were clean, and neatly arranged. A piece of\r\nscarlet embroidered cloth, called the snood, confined her hair, which\r\nfell over it in a profusion of rich dark curls. The scarlet plaid,\r\nwhich formed part of her dress, was laid aside, that it might not\r\nimpede her activity in attending the stranger. I should forget Alice’s\r\nproudest ornament were I to omit mentioning a pair of gold ear-rings\r\nand a golden rosary, which her father (for she was the daughter of\r\nDonald Bean Lean) had brought from France, the plunder, probably, of\r\nsome battle or storm.\r\n\r\nHer form, though rather large for her years, was very well\r\nproportioned, and her demeanour had a natural and rustic grace, with\r\nnothing of the sheepishness of an ordinary peasant. The smiles,\r\ndisplaying a row of teeth of exquisite whiteness, and the laughing\r\neyes, with which, in dumb show, she gave Waverley that morning greeting\r\nwhich she wanted English words to express, might have been interpreted\r\nby a coxcomb, or perhaps by a young soldier who, without being such,\r\nwas conscious of a handsome person, as meant to convey more than the\r\ncourtesy of an hostess. Nor do I take it upon me to say that the little\r\nwild mountaineer would have welcomed any staid old gentleman advanced\r\nin life, the Baron of Bradwardine, for example, with the cheerful pains\r\nwhich she bestowed upon Edward’s accommodation. She seemed eager to\r\nplace him by the meal which she had so sedulously arranged, and to\r\nwhich she now added a few bunches of cranberries, gathered in an\r\nadjacent morass. Having had the satisfaction of seeing him seated at\r\nhis breakfast, she placed herself demurely upon a stone at a few yards’\r\ndistance, and appeared to watch with great complacency for some\r\nopportunity of serving him.\r\n\r\nEvan and his attendant now returned slowly along the beach, the latter\r\nbearing a large salmon-trout, the produce of the morning’s sport,\r\ntogether with the angling-rod, while Evan strolled forward, with an\r\neasy, self-satisfied, and important gait, towards the spot where\r\nWaverley was so agreeably employed at the breakfast-table. After\r\nmorning greetings had passed on both sides, and Evan, looking at\r\nWaverley, had said something in Gaelic to Alice, which made her laugh,\r\nyet colour up to her eyes, through a complexion well embrowned by sun\r\nand wind, Evan intimated his commands that the fish should be prepared\r\nfor breakfast. A spark from the lock of his pistol produced a light,\r\nand a few withered fir branches were quickly in flame, and as speedily\r\nreduced to hot embers, on which the trout was broiled in large slices.\r\nTo crown the repast, Evan produced from the pocket of his short jerkin\r\na large scallop shell, and from under the folds of his plaid a ram’s\r\nhorn full of whisky. Of this he took a copious dram, observing he had\r\nalready taken his “morning” with Donald Bean Lean before his departure;\r\nhe offered the same cordial to Alice and to Edward, which they both\r\ndeclined. With the bounteous air of a lord, Evan then proffered the\r\nscallop to Dugald Mahony, his attendant, who, without waiting to be\r\nasked a second time, drank it off with great gusto. Evan then prepared\r\nto move towards the boat, inviting Waverley to attend him. Meanwhile,\r\nAlice had made up in a small basket what she thought worth removing,\r\nand flinging her plaid around her, she advanced up to Edward, and with\r\nthe utmost simplicity, taking hold of his hand, offered her cheek to\r\nhis salute, dropping at the same time her little curtsy. Evan, who was\r\nesteemed a wag among the mountain fair, advanced as if to secure a\r\nsimilar favour; but Alice, snatching up her basket, escaped up the\r\nrocky bank as fleetly as a roe, and, turning round and laughing, called\r\nsomething out to him in Gaelic, which he answered in the same tone and\r\nlanguage; then, waving her hand to Edward, she resumed her road, and\r\nwas soon lost among the thickets, though they continued for some time\r\nto hear her lively carol, as she proceeded gaily on her solitary\r\njourney.\r\n\r\nThey now again entered the gorge of the cavern, and stepping into the\r\nboat, the Highlander pushed off, and, taking advantage of the morning\r\nbreeze, hoisted a clumsy sort of sail, while Evan assumed the helm,\r\ndirecting their course, as it appeared to Waverley, rather higher up\r\nthe lake than towards the place of his embarkation on the preceding\r\nnight. As they glided along the silver mirror, Evan opened the\r\nconversation with a panegyric upon Alice, who, he said, was both\r\n“canny” and “fendy,” and was, to the boot of all that, the best dancer\r\nof a strathspey in the whole strath. Edward assented to her praises so\r\nfar as he understood them, yet could not help regretting that she was\r\ncondemned to such a perilous and dismal life.\r\n\r\n“_Oich!_ for that,” said Evan, “there is nothing in Perthshire that she\r\nneed want, if she ask her father to fetch it, unless it be too hot or\r\ntoo heavy.”\r\n\r\n“But to be the daughter of a cattle-stealer—a common thief!” “Common\r\nthief!—no such thing: Donald Bean Lean never _lifted_ less than a drove\r\nin his life.”\r\n\r\n“Do you call him an uncommon thief, then?”\r\n\r\n“No; he that steals a cow from a poor widow, or a stirk from a cotter,\r\nis a thief; he that lifts a drove from a Sassenach laird is a\r\ngentleman-drover. And, besides, to take a tree from the forest, a\r\nsalmon from the river, a deer from the hill, or a cow from a Lowland\r\nstrath, is what no Highlander need ever think shame upon.”\r\n\r\n“But what can this end in, were he taken in such an appropriation?”\r\n\r\n“To be sure he would _die for the law_, as many a pretty man has done\r\nbefore him.”\r\n\r\n“Die for the law!”\r\n\r\n“Ay; that is, with the law, or by the law; be strapped up on the _kind_\r\ngallows of Crieff,[16] where his father died, and his goodsire died,\r\nand where I hope he’ll live to die himsell, if he’s not shot, or\r\nslashed, in a _creagh_.”\r\n\r\n“You _hope_ such a death for your friend, Evan?”\r\n\r\n“And that do I e’en; would you have me wish him to die on a bundle of\r\nwet straw in yon den of his, like a mangy tyke?”\r\n\r\n“But what becomes of Alice, then?”\r\n\r\n“Troth, if such an accident were to happen, as her father would not\r\nneed her help ony langer, I ken nought to hinder me to marry her\r\nmysell.”\r\n\r\n“Gallantly resolved,” said Edward; “but, in the meanwhile, Evan, what\r\nhas your father-in-law (that shall be, if he have the good fortune to\r\nbe hanged) done with the Baron’s cattle?”\r\n\r\n“_Oich_,” answered Evan, “they were all trudging before your lad and\r\nAllan Kennedy before the sun blinked ower Ben Lawers this morning; and\r\nthey’ll be in the pass of Bally-Brough by this time, in their way back\r\nto the parks of Tully-Veolan, all but two, that were unhappily\r\nslaughtered before I got last night to Uaimh an Ri.”\r\n\r\n“And where are we going, Evan, if I may be so bold as to ask?” said\r\nWaverley.\r\n\r\n“Where would you be ganging, but to the Laird’s ain house of\r\nGlennaquoich? Ye would not think to be in his country, without ganging\r\nto see him? It would be as much as a man’s life’s worth.”\r\n\r\n“And are we far from Glennaquoich?”\r\n\r\n“But five bits of miles; and Vich Ian Vohr will meet us.”\r\n\r\nIn about half an hour they reached the upper end of the lake, where,\r\nafter landing Waverley, the two Highanders drew the boat into a little\r\ncreek among thick flags and reeds, where it lay perfectly concealed.\r\nThe oars they put in another place of concealment, both for the use of\r\nDonald Bean Lean probably, when his occasions should next bring him to\r\nthat place.\r\n\r\nThe travellers followed for some time a delightful opening into the\r\nhills, down which a little brook found its way to the lake. When they\r\nhad pursued their walk a short distance, Waverley renewed his questions\r\nabout their host of the cavern.\r\n\r\n“Does he always reside in that cave?”\r\n\r\n“Out, no! it’s past the skill of man to tell where he’s to be found at\r\na’ times; there’s not a dern nook, or cove, or _corri_, in the whole\r\ncountry that he’s not acquainted with.”\r\n\r\n“And do others beside your master shelter him?”\r\n\r\n“My master? _My_ master is in Heaven,” answered Evan, haughtily; and\r\nthen immediately assuming his usual civility of manner, “but you mean\r\nmy Chief;—no, he does not shelter Donald Bean Lean, nor any that are\r\nlike him; he only allows him (with a smile) wood and water.”\r\n\r\n“No great boon, I should think, Evan, when both seem to be very\r\nplenty.”\r\n\r\n“Ah! but ye dinna see through it. When I say wood and water, I mean the\r\nloch and the land; and I fancy Donald would be put till ’t if the Laird\r\nwere to look for him wi’ threescore men in the wood of Kailychat\r\nyonder; and if our boats, with a score or twa mair, were to come down\r\nthe loch to Uaimh an Ri, headed by mysell, or ony other pretty man.”\r\n\r\n“But suppose a strong party came against him from the Low Country,\r\nwould not your Chief defend him?”\r\n\r\n“Na, he would not ware the spark of a flint for him—if they came with\r\nthe law.”\r\n\r\n“And what must Donald do, then?”\r\n\r\n“He behoved to rid this country of himsell, and fall back, it may be,\r\nover the mount upon Letter Scriven.”\r\n\r\n“And if he were pursued to that place?”\r\n\r\n“I’se warrant he would go to his cousin’s at Rannoch.”\r\n\r\n“Well, but if they followed him to Rannoch?”\r\n\r\n“That,” quoth Evan, “is beyond all belief; and, indeed, to tell you the\r\ntruth, there durst not a Lowlander in all Scotland follow the fray a\r\ngun-shot beyond Bally-Brough, unless he had the help of the _Sidier\r\nDhu_.”\r\n\r\n“Whom do you call so?”\r\n\r\n“The _Sidier Dhu?_ the black soldier; that is what they call the\r\nindependent companies that were raised to keep peace and law in the\r\nHighlands. Vich Ian Vohr commanded one of them for five years, and I\r\nwas sergeant mysell, I shall warrant ye. They call them_ Sidier Dhu_\r\nbecause they wear the tartans, as they call your men—King George’s\r\nmen—_Sidier Roy_, or red soldiers.”\r\n\r\n“Well, but when you were in King George’s pay, Evan, you were surely\r\nKing George’s soldiers?”\r\n\r\n“Troth, and you must ask Vich Ian Vohr about that; for we are for his\r\nking, and care not much which o’ them it is. At ony rate, nobody can\r\nsay we are King George’s men now, when we have not seen his pay this\r\ntwelve-month.”\r\n\r\nThis last argument admitted of no reply, nor did Edward attempt any; he\r\nrather chose to bring back the discourse to Donald Bean Lean. “Does\r\nDonald confine himself to cattle, or does he ‘lift,’ as you call it,\r\nanything else that comes in his way?”\r\n\r\n“Troth, he’s nae nice body, and he’ll just tak onything, but most\r\nreadily cattle, horse, or live Christians; for sheep are slow of\r\ntravel, and inside plenishing is cumbrous to carry, and not easy to put\r\naway for siller in this country.”\r\n\r\n“But does he carry off men and women?”\r\n\r\n“Out, ay. Did not ye hear him speak o’ the Perth bailie? It cost that\r\nbody five hundred merks ere he got to the south of Bally-Brough. And\r\nance Donald played a pretty sport.[17] There was to be a blythe bridal\r\nbetween the Lady Cramfeezer, in the howe o’ the Mearns (she was the\r\nauld laird’s widow, and no sae young as she had been hersell), and\r\nyoung Gilliewhackit, who had spent his heirship and movables, like a\r\ngentleman, at cock-matches, bull-baitings, horse-races, and the like.\r\nNow, Donald Bean Lean, being aware that the bridegroom was in request,\r\nand wanting to cleik the cunzie (that is, to hook the siller), he\r\ncannily carried off Gilliewhackit ae night when he was riding\r\n_dovering_ hame (wi’ the malt rather abune the meal), and with the help\r\nof his gillies he gat him into the hills with the speed of light, and\r\nthe first place he wakened in was the cove of Uaimh an Ri. So there was\r\nold to do about ransoming the bridegroom; for Donald would not lower a\r\nfarthing of a thousand punds—”\r\n\r\n“The devil!”\r\n\r\n“Punds Scottish, ye shall understand. And the lady had not the siller\r\nif she had pawned her gown; and they applied to the governor o’\r\nStirling castle, and to the major o’ the Black Watch; and the governor\r\nsaid it was ower far to the northward, and out of his district; and the\r\nmajor said his men were gane hame to the shearing, and he would not\r\ncall them out before the victual was got in for all the Cramfeezers in\r\nChristendom, let alane the Mearns, for that it would prejudice the\r\ncountry. And in the meanwhile ye’ll no hinder Gilliewhackit to take the\r\nsmall-pox. There was not the doctor in Perth or Stirling would look\r\nnear the poor lad; and I cannot blame them, for Donald had been\r\nmisguggled by ane of these doctors about Paris, and he swore he would\r\nfling the first into the loch that he catched beyond the pass. However\r\nsome _cailliachs_ (that is, old women) that were about Donald’s hand\r\nnursed Gilliewhackit sae weel that, between the free open air in the\r\ncove and the fresh whey, deil an he did not recover maybe as weel as if\r\nhe had been closed in a glazed chamber and a bed with curtains, and fed\r\nwith red wine and white meat. And Donald was sae vexed about it that,\r\nwhen he was stout and weel, he even sent him free home, and said he\r\nwould be pleased with onything they would like to gie him for the\r\nplague and trouble which he had about Gilliewhackit to an unkenn’d\r\ndegree. And I cannot tell you precisely how they sorted; but they\r\nagreed sae right that Donald was invited to dance at the wedding in his\r\nHighland trews, and they said that there was never sae meikle siller\r\nclinked in his purse either before or since. And to the boot of all\r\nthat, Gilliewhackit said that, be the evidence what it liked, if he had\r\nthe luck to be on Donald’s inquest, he would bring him in guilty of\r\nnothing whatever, unless it were wilful arson or murder under trust.”\r\n\r\nWith such bald and disjointed chat Evan went on illustrating the\r\nexisting state of the Highlands, more perhaps to the amusement of\r\nWaverley than that of our readers. At length, after having marched over\r\nbank and brae, moss and heather, Edward, though not unacquainted with\r\nthe Scottish liberality in computing distance, began to think that\r\nEvan’s five miles were nearly doubled. His observation on the large\r\nmeasure which the Scottish allowed of their land, in comparison to the\r\ncomputation of their money, was readily answered by Evan with the old\r\njest, “The deil take them wha have the least pint stoup.”[*]\r\n\r\n[* The Scotch are liberal in computing their land and liquor; the\r\nScottish pint corresponds to two English quarts. As for their coin,\r\nevery one knows the couplet—\r\n\r\n\r\nHow can the rogues pretend to sense?\r\nTheir pound is only twenty pence.]\r\n\r\n\r\nAnd now the report of a gun was heard, and a sportsman was seen, with\r\nhis dogs and attendant, at the upper end of the glen. “Shough,” said\r\nDugald Mahony, “tat’s ta chief.”\r\n\r\n“It is not,” said Evan, imperiously. “Do you think he would come to\r\nmeet a Sassenach _duinhé-wassel_ in such a way as that?”\r\n\r\nBut as they approached a little nearer, he said, with an appearance of\r\nmortification, “And it is even he, sure enough; and he has not his tail\r\non after all; there is no living creature with him but Callum Beg.”\r\n\r\nIn fact, Fergus Mac-Ivor, of whom a Frenchman might have said as truly\r\nas of any man in the Highlands, “Qu’il connoit bien ses gens” had no\r\nidea of raising himself in the eyes of an English young man of fortune\r\nby appearing with a retinue of idle Highlanders disproportioned to the\r\noccasion. He was well aware that such an unnecessary attendance would\r\nseem to Edward rather ludicrous than respectable; and, while few men\r\nwere more attached to ideas of chieftainship and feudal power, he was,\r\nfor that very reason, cautious of exhibiting external marks of dignity,\r\nunless at the time and in the manner when they were most likely to\r\nproduce an imposing effect. Therefore, although, had he been to receive\r\na brother chieftain, he would probably have been attended by all that\r\nretinue which Evan described with so much unction, he judged it more\r\nrespectable to advance to meet Waverley with a single attendant, a very\r\nhandsome Highland boy, who carried his master’s shooting-pouch and his\r\nbroadsword, without which he seldom went abroad.\r\n\r\nWhen Fergus and Waverley met, the latter was struck with the peculiar\r\ngrace and dignity of the Chieftain’s figure. Above the middle size and\r\nfinely proportioned, the Highland dress, which he wore in its simplest\r\nmode, set off his person to great advantage. He wore the trews, or\r\nclose trowsers, made of tartan, chequed scarlet and white; in other\r\nparticulars his dress strictly resembled Evan’s, excepting that he had\r\nno weapon save a dirk, very richly mounted with silver. His page, as we\r\nhave said, carried his claymore; and the fowling-piece, which he held\r\nin his hand, seemed only designed for sport. He had shot in the course\r\nof his walk some young wild-ducks, as, though “close time” was then\r\nunknown, the broods of grouse were yet too young for the sportsman. His\r\ncountenance was decidedly Scottish, with all the peculiarities of the\r\nnorthern physiognomy, but yet had so little of its harshness and\r\nexaggeration that it would have been pronounced in any country\r\nextremely handsome. The martial air of the bonnet, with a single\r\neagle’s feather as a distinction, added much to the manly appearance of\r\nhis head, which was besides ornamented with a far more natural and\r\ngraceful cluster of close black curls than ever were exposed to sale in\r\nBond Street.\r\n\r\nAn air of openness and affability increased the favorable impression\r\nderived from this handsome and dignified exterior. Yet a skilful\r\nphysiognomist would have been less satisfied with the countenance on\r\nthe second than on the first view. The eyebrow and upper lip bespoke\r\nsomething of the habit of peremptory command and decisive superiority.\r\nEven his courtesy, though open, frank, and unconstrained, seemed to\r\nindicate a sense of personal importance; and, upon any check or\r\naccidental excitation, a sudden, though transient lour of the eye\r\nshowed a hasty, haughty, and vindictive temper, not less to be dreaded\r\nbecause it seemed much under its owner’s command. In short, the\r\ncountenance of the Chieftain resembled a smiling summer’s day, in\r\nwhich, notwithstanding, we are made sensible by certain, though slight\r\nsigns that it may thunder and lighten before the close of evening.\r\n\r\nIt was not, however, upon their first meeting that Edward had an\r\nopportunity of making these less favourable remarks. The Chief received\r\nhim as a friend of the Baron of Bradwardine, with the utmost expression\r\nof kindness and obligation for the visit; upbraided him gently with\r\nchoosing so rude an abode as he had done the night before; and entered\r\ninto a lively conversation with him about Donald Bean’s housekeeping,\r\nbut without the least hint as to his predatory habits, or the immediate\r\noccasion of Waverley’s visit, a topic which, as the Chief did not\r\nintroduce it, our hero also avoided. While they walked merrily on\r\ntowards the house of Glennaquoich, Evan, who now fell respectfully into\r\nthe rear, followed with Callum Beg and Dugald Mahony.\r\n\r\nWe shall take the opportunity to introduce the reader to some\r\nparticulars of Fergus Mac-Ivor’s character and history, which were not\r\ncompletely known to Waverley till after a connection which, though\r\narising from a circumstance so casual, had for a length of time the\r\ndeepest influence upon his character, actions, and prospects. But this,\r\nbeing an important subject, must form the commencement of a new\r\nchapter.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIX.\r\nTHE CHIEF AND HIS MANSION\r\n\r\n\r\nThe ingenious licentiate Francisco de Ubeda, when he commenced his\r\nhistory of “La Picara Justina Diez,”—which, by the way, is one of the\r\nmost rare books of Spanish literature,—complained of his pen having\r\ncaught up a hair, and forthwith begins, with more eloquence than common\r\nsense, an affectionate expostulation with that useful implement,\r\nupbraiding it with being the quill of a goose,—a bird inconstant by\r\nnature, as frequenting the three elements of water, earth, and air\r\nindifferently, and being, of course, “to one thing constant never.” Now\r\nI protest to thee, gentle reader, that I entirely dissent from\r\nFrancisco de Ubeda in this matter, and hold it the most useful quality\r\nof my pen, that it can speedily change from grave to gay, and from\r\ndescription and dialogue to narrative and character. So that if my\r\nquill display no other properties of its mother-goose than her\r\nmutability, truly I shall be well pleased; and I conceive that you, my\r\nworthy friend, will have no occasion for discontent. From the jargon,\r\ntherefore, of the Highland gillies I pass to the character of their\r\nChief. It is an important examination, and therefore, like Dogberry, we\r\nmust spare no wisdom.\r\n\r\nThe ancestor of Fergus Mac-Ivor, about three centuries before, had set\r\nup a claim to be recognised as chief of the numerous and powerful clan\r\nto which he belonged, the name of which it is unnecessary to mention.\r\nBeing defeated by an opponent who had more justice, or at least more\r\nforce, on his side, he moved southwards, with those who adhered to him,\r\nin quest of new settlements, like a second Æneas. The state of the\r\nPerthshire Highlands favoured his purpose. A great baron in that\r\ncountry had lately become traitor to the crown; Ian, which was the name\r\nof our adventurer, united himself with those who were commissioned by\r\nthe king to chastise him, and did such good service that he obtained a\r\ngrant of the property, upon which he and his posterity afterwards\r\nresided. He followed the king also in war to the fertile regions of\r\nEngland, where he employed his leisure hours so actively in raising\r\nsubsidies among the boors of Northumberland and Durham, that upon his\r\nreturn he was enabled to erect a stone tower, or fortalice, so much\r\nadmired by his dependants and neighbours that he, who had hitherto been\r\ncalled Ian Mac-Ivor, or John the son of Ivor, was thereafter\r\ndistinguished, both in song and genealogy, by the high title of Ian nan\r\nChaistel, or John of the Tower. The descendants of this worthy were so\r\nproud of him that the reigning chief always bore the patronymic title\r\nof Vich Ian Vohr, i.e. the son of John the Great; while the clan at\r\nlarge, to distinguish them from that from which they had seceded, were\r\ndenominated Sliochd nan Ivor, the race of Ivor.\r\n\r\nThe father of Fergus, the tenth in direct descent from John of the\r\nTower, engaged heart and hand in the insurrection of 1715, and was\r\nforced to fly to France, after the attempt of that year in favour of\r\nthe Stuarts had proved unsuccessful. More fortunate than other\r\nfugitives, he obtained employment in the French service, and married a\r\nlady of rank in that kingdom, by whom he had two children, Fergus and\r\nhis sister Flora. The Scottish estate had been forfeited and exposed to\r\nsale, but was repurchased for a small price in the name of the young\r\nproprietor, who in consequence came to reside upon his native\r\ndomains.[18] It was soon perceived that he possessed a character of\r\nuncommon acuteness, fire, and ambition, which, as he became acquainted\r\nwith the state of the country, gradually assumed a mixed and peculiar\r\ntone, that could only have been acquired Sixty Years Since.\r\n\r\nHad Fergus Mac-Ivor lived Sixty Years sooner than he did, he would in\r\nall probability have wanted the polished manner and knowledge of the\r\nworld which he now possessed; and had he lived Sixty Years later, his\r\nambition and love of rule would have lacked the fuel which his\r\nsituation now afforded. He was indeed, within his little circle, as\r\nperfect a politician as Castruccio Castracani himself. He applied\r\nhimself with great earnestness to appease all the feuds and dissensions\r\nwhich often arose among other clans in his neighbourhood, so that he\r\nbecame a frequent umpire in their quarrels. His own patriarchal power\r\nhe strengthened at every expense which his fortune would permit, and\r\nindeed stretched his means to the uttermost to maintain the rude and\r\nplentiful hospitality which was the most valued attribute of a\r\nchieftain. For the same reason he crowded his estate with a tenantry,\r\nhardy indeed, and fit for the purposes of war, but greatly outnumbering\r\nwhat the soil was calculated to maintain. These consisted chiefly of\r\nhis own clan, not one of whom he suffered to quit his lands if he could\r\npossibly prevent it. But he maintained, besides, many adventurers from\r\nthe mother sept, who deserted a less warlike, though more wealthy chief\r\nto do homage to Fergus Mac-Ivor. Other individuals, too, who had not\r\neven that apology, were nevertheless received into his allegiance,\r\nwhich indeed was refused to none who were, like Poins, proper men of\r\ntheir hands, and were willing to assume the name of Mac-Ivor.\r\n\r\nHe was enabled to discipline these forces, from having obtained command\r\nof one of the independent companies raised by government to preserve\r\nthe peace of the Highlands. While in this capacity he acted with vigour\r\nand spirit, and preserved great order in the country under his charge.\r\nHe caused his vassals to enter by rotation into his company, and serve\r\nfor a certain space of time, which gave them all in turn a general\r\nnotion of military discipline. In his campaigns against the banditti,\r\nit was observed that he assumed and exercised to the utmost the\r\ndiscretionary power which, while the law had no free course in the\r\nHighlands, was conceived to belong to the military parties who were\r\ncalled in to support it. He acted, for example, with great and\r\nsuspicious lenity to those freebooters who made restitution on his\r\nsummons and offered personal submission to himself, while he rigorously\r\npursued, apprehended, and sacrificed to justice all such interlopers as\r\ndared to despise his admonitions or commands. On the other hand, if any\r\nofficers of justice, military parties, or others, presumed to pursue\r\nthieves or marauders through his territories, and without applying for\r\nhis consent and concurrence, nothing was more certain than that they\r\nwould meet with some notable foil or defeat; upon which occasions\r\nFergus Mac-Ivor was the first to condole with them, and after gently\r\nblaming their rashness, never failed deeply to lament the lawless state\r\nof the country. These lamentations did not exclude suspicion, and\r\nmatters were so represented to government that our Chieftain was\r\ndeprived of his military command.[19]\r\n\r\nWhatever Fergus Mac-Ivor felt on this occasion, he had the art of\r\nentirely suppressing every appearance of discontent; but in a short\r\ntime the neighbouring country began to feel bad effects from his\r\ndisgrace. Donald Bean Lean, and others of his class, whose depredations\r\nhad hitherto been confined to other districts, appeared from\r\nthenceforward to have made a settlement on this devoted border; and\r\ntheir ravages were carried on with little opposition, as the Lowland\r\ngentry were chiefly Jacobites, and disarmed. This forced many of the\r\ninhabitants into contracts of black-mail with Fergus Mac-Ivor, which\r\nnot only established him their protector, and gave him great weight in\r\nall their consultations, but, moreover, supplied funds for the waste of\r\nhis feudal hospitality, which the discontinuance of his pay might have\r\notherwise essentially diminished.\r\n\r\nIn following this course of conduct, Fergus had a further object than\r\nmerely being the great man of his neighbourhood, and ruling\r\ndespotically over a small clan. From his infancy upward he had devoted\r\nhimself to the cause of the exiled family, and had persuaded himself,\r\nnot only that their restoration to the crown of Britain would be\r\nspeedy, but that those who assisted them would be raised to honour and\r\nrank. It was with this view that he laboured to reconcile the\r\nHighlanders among themselves, and augmented his own force to the\r\nutmost, to be prepared for the first favourable opportunity of rising.\r\nWith this purpose also he conciliated the favour of such Lowland\r\ngentlemen in the vicinity as were friends to the good cause; and for\r\nthe same reason, having incautiously quarrelled with Mr. Bradwardine,\r\nwho, notwithstanding his peculiarities, was much respected in the\r\ncountry, he took advantage of the foray of Donald Bean Lean to solder\r\nup the dispute in the manner we have mentioned. Some, indeed, surmised\r\nthat he caused the enterprise to be suggested to Donald, on purpose to\r\npave the way to a reconciliation, which, supposing that to be the case,\r\ncost the Laird of Bradwardine two good milch cows. This zeal in their\r\nbehalf the House of Stuart repaid with a considerable share of their\r\nconfidence, an occasional supply of louis-d’or, abundance of fair\r\nwords, and a parchment, with a huge waxen seal appended, purporting to\r\nbe an earl’s patent, granted by no less a person than James the Third\r\nKing of England, and Eighth King of Scotland, to his right feal,\r\ntrusty, and well-beloved Fergus Mac-Ivor of Glennaquoich, in the county\r\nof Perth, and kingdom of Scotland.\r\n\r\nWith this future coronet glittering before his eyes, Fergus plunged\r\ndeeply into the correspondence and plots of that unhappy period; and,\r\nlike all such active agents, easily reconciled his conscience to going\r\ncertain lengths in the service of his party, from which honour and\r\npride would have deterred him had his sole object been the direct\r\nadvancement of his own personal interest. With this insight into a\r\nbold, ambitious, and ardent, yet artful and politic character, we\r\nresume the broken thread of our narrative.\r\n\r\nThe chief and his guest had by this time reached the house of\r\nGlennaquoich, which consisted of Ian nan Chaistel’s mansion, a high\r\nrude-looking square tower, with the addition of a _lofted_ house, that\r\nis, a building of two stories, constructed by Fergus’s grandfather when\r\nhe returned from that memorable expedition, well remembered by the\r\nwestern shires under the name of the Highland Host. Upon occasion of\r\nthis crusade against the Ayrshire Whigs and Covenanters, the Vich Ian\r\nVohr of the time had probably been as successful as his predecessor was\r\nin harrying Northumberland, and therefore left to his posterity a rival\r\nedifice as a monument of his magnificence.\r\n\r\nAround the house, which stood on an eminence in the midst of a narrow\r\nHighland valley, there appeared none of that attention to convenience,\r\nfar less to ornament and decoration, which usually surrounds a\r\ngentleman’s habitation. An inclosure or two, divided by dry-stone\r\nwalls, were the only part of the domain that was fenced; as to the\r\nrest, the narrow slips of level ground which lay by the side of the\r\nbrook exhibited a scanty crop of barley, liable to constant\r\ndepredations from the herds of wild ponies and black cattle that grazed\r\nupon the adjacent hills. These ever and anon made an incursion upon the\r\narable ground, which was repelled by the loud, uncouth, and dissonant\r\nshouts of half a dozen Highland swains, all running as if they had been\r\nmad, and every one hallooing a half-starved dog to the rescue of the\r\nforage. At a little distance up the glen was a small and stunted wood\r\nof birch; the hills were high and heathy, but without any variety of\r\nsurface; so that the whole view was wild and desolate rather than grand\r\nand solitary. Yet, such as it was, no genuine descendant of Ian nan\r\nChaistel would have changed the domain for Stow or Blenheim.\r\n\r\nThere was a sight, however, before the gate, which perhaps would have\r\nafforded the first owner of Blenheim more pleasure than the finest view\r\nin the domain assigned to him by the gratitude of his country. This\r\nconsisted of about a hundred Highlanders, in complete dress and arms;\r\nat sight of whom the Chieftain apologised to Waverley in a sort of\r\nnegligent manner. “He had forgot,” he said, “that he had ordered a few\r\nof his clan out, for the purpose of seeing that they were in a fit\r\ncondition to protect the country, and prevent such accidents as, he was\r\nsorry to learn, had befallen the Baron of Bradwardine. Before they were\r\ndismissed, perhaps Captain Waverley might choose to see them go through\r\na part of their exercise.”\r\n\r\nEdward assented, and the men executed with agility and precision some\r\nof the ordinary military movements. They then practised individually at\r\na mark, and showed extraordinary dexterity in the management of the\r\npistol and firelock. They took aim, standing, sitting, leaning, or\r\nlying prostrate, as they were commanded, and always with effect upon\r\nthe target. Next, they paired off for the broadsword exercise; and,\r\nhaving manifested their individual skill and dexterity, united in two\r\nbodies, and exhibited a sort of mock encounter, in which the charge,\r\nthe rally, the flight, the pursuit, and all the current of a heady\r\nfight, were exhibited to the sound of the great war bagpipe.\r\n\r\nOn a signal made by the Chief, the skirmish was ended. Matches were\r\nthen made for running, wrestling, leaping, pitching the bar, and other\r\nsports, in which this feudal militia displayed incredible swiftness,\r\nstrength, and agility; and accomplished the purpose which their\r\nChieftain had at heart, by impressing on Waverley no light sense of\r\ntheir merit as soldiers, and of the power of him who commanded them by\r\nhis nod.[20]\r\n\r\n“And what number of such gallant fellows have the happiness to call you\r\nleader?” asked Waverley.\r\n\r\n“In a good cause, and under a chieftain whom they loved, the race of\r\nIvor have seldom taken the field under five hundred claymores. But you\r\nare aware, Captain Waverley, that the disarming act, passed about\r\ntwenty years ago, prevents their being in the complete state of\r\npreparation as in former times; and I keep no more of my clan under\r\narms than may defend my own or my friends’ property, when the country\r\nis troubled with such men as your last night’s landlord; and\r\ngovernment, which has removed other means of defence, must connive at\r\nour protecting ourselves.”\r\n\r\n“But, with your force, you might soon destroy or put down such gangs as\r\nthat of Donald Bean Lean.”\r\n\r\n“Yes, doubtless; and my reward would be a summons to deliver up to\r\nGeneral Blakeney, at Stirling, the few broadswords they have left us;\r\nthere were little policy in that, methinks. But come, captain, the\r\nsound of the pipes informs me that dinner is prepared. Let me have the\r\nhonour to show you into my rude mansion.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XX.\r\nA HIGHLAND FEAST\r\n\r\n\r\nEre Waverley entered the banqueting hall, he was offered the\r\npatriarchal refreshment of a bath for the feet, which the sultry\r\nweather, and the morasses he had traversed, rendered highly acceptable.\r\nHe was not, indeed, so luxuriously attended upon this occasion as the\r\nheroic travellers in the Odyssey; the task of ablution and abstersion\r\nbeing performed, not by a beautiful damsel, trained\r\n\r\nTo chafe the limb, and pour the fragrant oil,\r\n\r\n\r\nbut by a smoke-dried skinny old Highland woman, who did not seem to\r\nthink herself much honoured by the duty imposed upon her, but muttered\r\nbetween her teeth, “Our fathers’ herds did not feed so near together\r\nthat I should do you this service.” A small donation, however, amply\r\nreconciled this ancient handmaiden to the supposed degradation; and, as\r\nEdward proceeded to the hall, she gave him her blessing in the Gaelic\r\nproverb, “May the open hand be filled the fullest.”\r\n\r\nThe hall, in which the feast was prepared, occupied all the first story\r\nof Ian nan Chaistel’s original erection, and a huge oaken table\r\nextended through its whole length. The apparatus for dinner was simple,\r\neven to rudeness, and the company numerous, even to crowding. At the\r\nhead of the table was the Chief himself, with Edward, and two or three\r\nHighland visitors of neighbouring clans; the elders of his own tribe,\r\nwadsetters and tacksmen, as they were called, who occupied portions of\r\nhis estate as mortgagers or lessees, sat next in rank; beneath them,\r\ntheir sons and nephews and foster-brethren; then the officers of the\r\nChief’s household, according to their order; and lowest of all, the\r\ntenants who actually cultivated the ground. Even beyond this long\r\nperspective, Edward might see upon the green, to which a huge pair of\r\nfolding doors opened, a multitude of Highlanders of a yet inferior\r\ndescription, who, nevertheless, were considered as guests, and had\r\ntheir share both of the countenance of the entertainer and of the cheer\r\nof the day. In the distance, and fluctuating round this extreme verge\r\nof the banquet, was a changeful group of women, ragged boys and girls,\r\nbeggars, young and old, large greyhounds, and terriers, and pointers,\r\nand curs of low degree; all of whom took some interest, more or less\r\nimmediate, in the main action of the piece.\r\n\r\nThis hospitality, apparently unbounded, had yet its line of economy.\r\nSome pains had been bestowed in dressing the dishes of fish, game,\r\netc., which were at the upper end of the table, and immediately under\r\nthe eye of the English stranger. Lower down stood immense clumsy joints\r\nof mutton and beef, which, but for the absence of pork,[21] abhorred in\r\nthe Highlands, resembled the rude festivity of the banquet of\r\nPenelope’s suitors. But the central dish was a yearling lamb, called “a\r\nhog in har’st,” roasted whole. It was set upon its legs, with a bunch\r\nof parsley in its mouth, and was probably exhibited in that form to\r\ngratify the pride of the cook, who piqued himself more on the plenty\r\nthan the elegance of his master’s table. The sides of this poor animal\r\nwere fiercely attacked by the clansmen, some with dirks, others with\r\nthe knives which were usually in the same sheath with the dagger, so\r\nthat it was soon rendered a mangled and rueful spectacle. Lower down\r\nstill, the victuals seemed of yet coarser quality, though sufficiently\r\nabundant. Broth, onions, cheese, and the fragments of the feast regaled\r\nthe sons of Ivor who feasted in the open air.\r\n\r\nThe liquor was supplied in the same proportion, and under similar\r\nregulations. Excellent claret and champagne were liberally distributed\r\namong the Chief’s immediate neighbours; whisky, plain or diluted, and\r\nstrong beer refreshed those who sat near the lower end. Nor did this\r\ninequality of distribution appear to give the least offence. Every one\r\npresent understood that his taste was to be formed according to the\r\nrank which he held at table; and, consequently, the tacksmen and their\r\ndependants always professed the wine was too cold for their stomachs,\r\nand called, apparently out of choice, for the liquor which was assigned\r\nto them from economy.[22] The bag-pipers, three in number, screamed,\r\nduring the whole time of dinner, a tremendous war-tune; and the echoing\r\nof the vaulted roof, and clang of the Celtic tongue, produced such a\r\nBabel of noises that Waverley dreaded his ears would never recover it.\r\nMac-Ivor, indeed, apologised for the confusion occasioned by so large a\r\nparty, and pleaded the necessity of his situation, on which unlimited\r\nhospitality was imposed as a paramount duty. “These stout idle kinsmen\r\nof mine,” he said, “account my estate as held in trust for their\r\nsupport; and I must find them beef and ale, while the rogues will do\r\nnothing for themselves but practise the broadsword, or wander about the\r\nhills, shooting, fishing, hunting, drinking, and making love to the\r\nlasses of the strath. But what can I do, Captain Waverley? everything\r\nwill keep after its kind, whether it be a hawk or a Highlander.” Edward\r\nmade the expected answer, in a compliment upon his possessing so many\r\nbold and attached followers.\r\n\r\n“Why, yes,” replied the Chief, “were I disposed, like my father, to put\r\nmyself in the way of getting one blow on the head, or two on the neck,\r\nI believe the loons would stand by me. But who thinks of that in the\r\npresent day, when the maxim is, ‘Better an old woman with a purse in\r\nher hand than three men with belted brands?’” Then, turning to the\r\ncompany, he proposed the “Health of Captain Waverley, a worthy friend\r\nof his kind neighbour and ally, the Baron of Bradwardine.”\r\n\r\n“He is welcome hither,” said one of the elders, “if he come from Cosmo\r\nComyne Bradwardine.”\r\n\r\n“I say nay to that,” said an old man, who apparently did not mean to\r\npledge the toast;—“I say nay to that. While there is a green leaf in\r\nthe forest, there will be fraud in a Comyne.”\r\n\r\n“There is nothing but honour in the Baron of Bradwardine,” answered\r\nanother ancient; “and the guest that comes hither from him should be\r\nwelcome, though he came with blood on his hand, unless it were blood of\r\nthe race of Ivor.”\r\n\r\nThe old man whose cup remained full replied, “There has been blood\r\nenough of the race of Ivor on the hand of Bradwardine.”\r\n\r\n“Ah! Ballenkeiroch,” replied the first, “you think rather of the flash\r\nof the carbine at the mains of Tully-Veolan than the glance of the\r\nsword that fought for the cause at Preston.”\r\n\r\n“And well I may,” answered Ballenkeiroch; “the flash of the gun cost me\r\na fair-haired son, and the glance of the sword has done but little for\r\nKing James.”\r\n\r\nThe Chieftain, in two words of French, explained to Waverley that the\r\nBaron had shot this old man’s son in a fray near Tully-Veolan, about\r\nseven years before; and then hastened to remove Ballenkeiroch’s\r\nprejudice, by informing him that Waverley was an Englishman,\r\nunconnected by birth or alliance with the family of Bradwardine; upon\r\nwhich the old gentleman raised the hitherto-untasted cup and\r\ncourteously drank to his health. This ceremony being requited in kind,\r\nthe Chieftain made a signal for the pipes to cease, and said aloud,\r\n“Where is the song hidden, my friends, that Mac-Murrough cannot find\r\nit?”\r\n\r\nMac-Murrough, the family _bhairdh_, an aged man, immediately took the\r\nhint, and began to chant, with low and rapid utterance, a profusion of\r\nCeltic verses, which were received by the audience with all the\r\napplause of enthusiasm. As he advanced in his declamation, his ardour\r\nseemed to increase. He had at first spoken with his eyes fixed on the\r\nground; he now cast them around as if beseeching, and anon as if\r\ncommanding, attention, and his tones rose into wild and impassioned\r\nnotes, accompanied with appropriate gestures. He seemed to Edward, who\r\nattended to him with much interest, to recite many proper names, to\r\nlament the dead, to apostrophise the absent, to exhort, and entreat,\r\nand animate those who were present. Waverley thought he even discerned\r\nhis own name, and was convinced his conjecture was right from the eyes\r\nof the company being at that moment turned towards him simultaneously.\r\nThe ardour of the poet appeared to communicate itself to the audience.\r\nTheir wild and sun-burnt countenances assumed a fiercer and more\r\nanimated expression; all bent forward towards the reciter, many sprung\r\nup and waved their arms in ecstasy, and some laid their hands on their\r\nswords. When the song ceased, there was a deep pause, while the aroused\r\nfeelings of the poet and of the hearers gradually subsided into their\r\nusual channel.\r\n\r\nThe Chieftain, who, during this scene had appeared rather to watch the\r\nemotions which were excited than to partake their high tone of\r\nenthusiasm, filled with claret a small silver cup which stood by him.\r\n“Give this,” he said to an attendant, “to Mac-Murrough nan Fonn (that\r\nis, of the songs), and when he has drank the juice, bid him keep, for\r\nthe sake of Vich Ian Vohr, the shell of the gourd which contained it.”\r\nThe gift was received by Mac-Murrough with profound gratitude; he drank\r\nthe wine, and, kissing the cup, shrouded it with reverence in the plaid\r\nwhich was folded on his bosom. He then burst forth into what Edward\r\njustly supposed to be an extemporaneous effusion of thanks and praises\r\nof his Chief. It was received with applause, but did not produce the\r\neffect of his first poem. It was obvious, however, that the clan\r\nregarded the generosity of their Chieftain with high approbation. Many\r\napproved Gaelic toasts were then proposed, of some of which the\r\nChieftain gave his guest the following versions:—\r\n\r\n“To him that will not turn his back on friend or foe.” “To him that\r\nnever forsook a comrade.” “To him that never bought or sold justice.”\r\n“Hospitality to the exile, and broken bones to the tyrant.” “The lads\r\nwith the kilts.” “Highlanders, shoulder to shoulder,”—with many other\r\npithy sentiments of the like nature.\r\n\r\nEdward was particularly solicitous to know the meaning of that song\r\nwhich appeared to produce such effect upon the passions of the company,\r\nand hinted his curiosity to his host. “As I observe,” said the\r\nChieftain, “that you have passed the bottle during the last three\r\nrounds, I was about to propose to you to retire to my sister’s\r\ntea-table, who can explain these things to you better than I can.\r\nAlthough I cannot stint my clan in the usual current of their\r\nfestivity, yet I neither am addicted myself to exceed in its amount,\r\nnor do I,” added he, smiling, “keep a Bear to devour the intellects of\r\nsuch as can make good use of them.”\r\n\r\nEdward readily assented to this proposal, and the Chieftain, saying a\r\nfew words to those around him, left the table, followed by Waverley. As\r\nthe door closed behind them, Edward heard Vich Ian Vohr’s health\r\ninvoked with a wild and animated cheer, that expressed the satisfaction\r\nof the guests and the depth of their devotion to his service.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXI.\r\nTHE CHIEFTAIN’S SISTER\r\n\r\n\r\nThe drawing-room of Flora Mac-Ivor was furnished in the plainest and\r\nmost simple manner; for at Glennaquoich every other sort of expenditure\r\nwas retrenched as much as possible, for the purpose of maintaining, in\r\nits full dignity, the hospitality of the Chieftain, and retaining and\r\nmultiplying the number of his dependants and adherents. But there was\r\nno appearance of this parsimony in the dress of the lady herself, which\r\nwas in texture elegant, and even rich, and arranged in a manner which\r\npartook partly of the Parisian fashion and partly of the more simple\r\ndress of the Highlands, blended together with great taste. Her hair was\r\nnot disfigured by the art of the friseur, but fell in jetty ringlets on\r\nher neck, confined only by a circlet, richly set with diamonds. This\r\npeculiarity she adopted in compliance with the Highland prejudices,\r\nwhich could not endure that a woman’s head should be covered before\r\nwedlock.\r\n\r\nFlora Mac-Ivor bore a most striking resemblance to her brother Fergus;\r\nso much so that they might have played Viola and Sebastian with the\r\nsame exquisite effect produced by the appearance of Mrs. Henry Siddons\r\nand her brother, Mr. William Murray, in these characters. They had the\r\nsame antique and regular correctness of profile; the same dark eyes,\r\neye-lashes, and eye-brows; the same clearness of complexion, excepting\r\nthat Fergus’s was embrowned by exercise and Flora’s possessed the\r\nutmost feminine delicacy. But the haughty and somewhat stern regularity\r\nof Fergus’s features was beautifully softened in those of Flora. Their\r\nvoices were also similar in tone, though differing in the key. That of\r\nFergus, especially while issuing orders to his followers during their\r\nmilitary exercise, reminded Edward of a favourite passage in the\r\ndescription of Emetrius:\r\n\r\n“Whose voice was heard around,\r\nLoud as a trumpet with a silver sound.”\r\n\r\n\r\nThat of Flora, on the contrary, was soft and sweet—“an excellent thing\r\nin woman”; yet, in urging any favourite topic, which she often pursued\r\nwith natural eloquence, it possessed as well the tones which impress\r\nawe and conviction as those of persuasive insinuation. The eager glance\r\nof the keen black eye, which, in the Chieftain, seemed impatient even\r\nof the material obstacles it encountered, had in his sister acquired a\r\ngentle pensiveness. His looks seemed to seek glory, power, all that\r\ncould exalt him above others in the race of humanity; while those of\r\nhis sister, as if she were already conscious of mental superiority,\r\nseemed to pity, rather than envy, those who were struggling for any\r\nfarther distinction. Her sentiments corresponded with the expression of\r\nher countenance. Early education had impressed upon her mind, as well\r\nas on that of the Chieftain, the most devoted attachment to the exiled\r\nfamily of Stuart. She believed it the duty of her brother, of his clan,\r\nof every man in Britain, at whatever personal hazard, to contribute to\r\nthat restoration which the partisans of the Chevalier St. George had\r\nnot ceased to hope for. For this she was prepared to do all, to suffer\r\nall, to sacrifice all. But her loyalty, as it exceeded her brother’s in\r\nfanaticism, excelled it also in purity. Accustomed to petty intrigue,\r\nand necessarily involved in a thousand paltry and selfish discussions,\r\nambitious also by nature, his political faith was tinctured, at least,\r\nif not tainted, by the views of interest and advancement so easily\r\ncombined with it; and at the moment he should unsheathe his claymore,\r\nit might be difficult to say whether it would be most with the view of\r\nmaking James Stuart a king or Fergus Mac-Ivor an earl. This, indeed,\r\nwas a mixture of feeling which he did not avow even to himself, but it\r\nexisted, nevertheless, in a powerful degree.\r\n\r\nIn Flora’s bosom, on the contrary, the zeal of loyalty burnt pure and\r\nunmixed with any selfish feeling; she would have as soon made religion\r\nthe mask of ambitious and interested views as have shrouded them under\r\nthe opinions which she had been taught to think patriotism. Such\r\ninstances of devotion were not uncommon among the followers of the\r\nunhappy race of Stuart, of which many memorable proofs will recur to\r\nthe minds of most of my readers. But peculiar attention on the part of\r\nthe Chevalier de St. George and his princess to the parents of Fergus\r\nand his sister, and to themselves when orphans, had riveted their\r\nfaith. Fergus, upon the death of his parents, had been for some time a\r\npage of honour in the train of the Chevalier’s lady, and, from his\r\nbeauty and sprightly temper, was uniformly treated by her with the\r\nutmost distinction. This was also extended to Flora, who was maintained\r\nfor some time at a convent of the first order at the princess’s\r\nexpense, and removed from thence into her own family, where she spent\r\nnearly two years. Both brother and sister retained the deepest and most\r\ngrateful sense of her kindness.\r\n\r\nHaving thus touched upon the leading principle of Flora’s character, I\r\nmay dismiss the rest more slightly. She was highly accomplished, and\r\nhad acquired those elegant manners to be expected from one who, in\r\nearly youth, had been the companion of a princess; yet she had not\r\nlearned to substitute the gloss of politeness for the reality of\r\nfeeling. When settled in the lonely regions of Glennaquoich, she found\r\nthat her resources in French, English, and Italian literature were\r\nlikely to be few and interrupted; and, in order to fill up the vacant\r\ntime, she bestowed a part of it upon the music and poetical traditions\r\nof the Highlanders, and began really to feel the pleasure in the\r\npursuit which her brother, whose perceptions of literary merit were\r\nmore blunt, rather affected for the sake of popularity than actually\r\nexperienced. Her resolution was strengthened in these researches by the\r\nextreme delight which her inquiries seemed to afford those to whom she\r\nresorted for information.\r\n\r\nHer love of her clan, an attachment which was almost hereditary in her\r\nbosom, was, like her loyalty, a more pure passion than that of her\r\nbrother. He was too thorough a politician, regarded his patriarchal\r\ninfluence too much as the means of accomplishing his own\r\naggrandisement, that we should term him the model of a Highland\r\nChieftain. Flora felt the same anxiety for cherishing and extending\r\ntheir patriarchal sway, but it was with the generous desire of\r\nvindicating from poverty, or at least from want and foreign oppression,\r\nthose whom her brother was by birth, according to the notions of the\r\ntime and country, entitled to govern. The savings of her income, for\r\nshe had a small pension from the Princess Sobieski, were dedicated, not\r\nto add to the comforts of the peasantry, for that was a word which they\r\nneither knew nor apparently wished to know, but to relieve their\r\nabsolute necessities when in sickness or extreme old age. At every\r\nother period they rather toiled to procure something which they might\r\nshare with the Chief, as a proof of their attachment, than expected\r\nother assistance from him save what was afforded by the rude\r\nhospitality of his castle, and the general division and subdivision of\r\nhis estate among them. Flora was so much beloved by them that, when\r\nMac-Murrough composed a song in which he enumerated all the principal\r\nbeauties of the district, and intimated her superiority by concluding,\r\nthat “the fairest apple hung on the highest bough,” he received, in\r\ndonatives from the individuals of the clan, more seed-barley than would\r\nhave sowed his Highland Parnassus, the bard’s croft, as it was called,\r\nten times over.\r\n\r\nFrom situation as well as choice, Miss Mac-Ivor’s society was extremely\r\nlimited. Her most intimate friend had been Rose Bradwardine, to whom\r\nshe was much attached; and when seen together, they would have afforded\r\nan artist two admirable subjects for the gay and the melancholy muse.\r\nIndeed Rose was so tenderly watched by her father, and her circle of\r\nwishes was so limited, that none arose but what he was willing to\r\ngratify, and scarce any which did not come within the compass of his\r\npower. With Flora it was otherwise. While almost a girl she had\r\nundergone the most complete change of scene, from gaiety and splendour\r\nto absolute solitude and comparative poverty; and the ideas and wishes\r\nwhich she chiefly fostered respected great national events, and changes\r\nnot to be brought round without both hazard and bloodshed, and\r\ntherefore not to be thought of with levity. Her manner, consequently,\r\nwas grave, though she readily contributed her talents to the amusement\r\nof society, and stood very high in the opinion of the old Baron, who\r\nused to sing along with her such French duets of Lindor and Cloris,\r\netc., as were in fashion about the end of the reign of old Louis le\r\nGrand.\r\n\r\nIt was generally believed, though no one durst have hinted it to the\r\nBaron of Bradwardine, that Flora’s entreaties had no small share in\r\nallaying the wrath of Fergus upon occasion of their quarrel. She took\r\nher brother on the assailable side, by dwelling first upon the Baron’s\r\nage, and then representing the injury which the cause might sustain,\r\nand the damage which must arise to his own character in point of\r\nprudence—so necessary to a political agent, if he persisted in carrying\r\nit to extremity. Otherwise it is probable it would have terminated in a\r\nduel, both because the Baron had, on a former occasion, shed blood of\r\nthe clan, though the matter had been timely accommodated, and on\r\naccount of his high reputation for address at his weapon, which Fergus\r\nalmost condescended to envy. For the same reason she had urged their\r\nreconciliation, which the Chieftain the more readily agreed to as it\r\nfavoured some ulterior projects of his own.\r\n\r\nTo this young lady, now presiding at the female empire of the\r\ntea-table, Fergus introduced Captain Waverley, whom she received with\r\nthe usual forms of politeness.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXII.\r\nHIGHLAND MINSTRELSY\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen the first salutations had passed, Fergus said to his sister, “My\r\ndear Flora, before I return to the barbarous ritual of our forefathers,\r\nI must tell you that Captain Waverley is a worshipper of the Celtic\r\nmuse, not the less so perhaps that he does not understand a word of her\r\nlanguage. I have told him you are eminent as a translator of Highland\r\npoetry, and that Mac-Murrough admires your version of his songs upon\r\nthe same principle that Captain Waverley admires the original,—because\r\nhe does not comprehend them. Will you have the goodness to read or\r\nrecite to our guest in English the extraordinary string of names which\r\nMac-Murrough has tacked together in Gaelic? My life to a moor-fowl’s\r\nfeather, you are provided with a version; for I know you are in all the\r\nbard’s councils, and acquainted with his songs long before he rehearses\r\nthem in the hall.”\r\n\r\n“How can you say so, Fergus? You know how little these verses can\r\npossibly interest an English stranger, even if I could translate them\r\nas you pretend.”\r\n\r\n“Not less than they interest me, lady fair. To-day your joint\r\ncomposition, for I insist you had a share in it, has cost me the last\r\nsilver cup in the castle, and I suppose will cost me something else\r\nnext time I hold _cour plénière_, if the muse descends on Mac-Murrough;\r\nfor you know our proverb,—“When the hand of the chief ceases to bestow,\r\nthe breath of the bard is frozen in the utterance.”—Well, I would it\r\nwere even so: there are three things that are useless to a modern\r\nHighlander,—a sword which he must not draw, a bard to sing of deeds\r\nwhich he dare not imitate, and a large goat-skin purse without a\r\nlouis-d’or to put into it.”\r\n\r\n“Well, brother, since you betray my secrets, you cannot expect me to\r\nkeep yours. I assure you, Captain Waverley, that Fergus is too proud to\r\nexchange his broadsword for a maréchal’s baton, that he esteems\r\nMac-Murrough a far greater poet than Homer, and would not give up his\r\ngoat-skin purse for all the louis-d’or which it could contain.”\r\n\r\n“Well pronounced, Flora; blow for blow, as Conan[23] said to the devil.\r\nNow do you two talk of bards and poetry, if not of purses and\r\nclaymores, while I return to do the final honours to the senators of\r\nthe tribe of Ivor.” So saying, he left the room.\r\n\r\nThe conversation continued between Flora and Waverley; for two\r\nwell-dressed young women, whose character seemed to hover between that\r\nof companions and dependants, took no share in it. They were both\r\npretty girls, but served only as foils to the grace and beauty of their\r\npatroness. The discourse followed the turn which the Chieftain had\r\ngiven it, and Waverley was equally amused and surprised with the\r\naccount which the lady gave him of Celtic poetry.\r\n\r\n“The recitation,” she said, “of poems recording the feats of heroes,\r\nthe complaints of lovers, and the wars of contending tribes, forms the\r\nchief amusement of a winter fire-side in the Highlands. Some of these\r\nare said to be very ancient, and if they are ever translated into any\r\nof the languages of civilised Europe, cannot fail to produce a deep and\r\ngeneral sensation. Others are more modern, the composition of those\r\nfamily bards whom the chieftains of more distinguished name and power\r\nretain as the poets and historians of their tribes. These, of course,\r\npossess various degrees of merit; but much of it must evaporate in\r\ntranslation, or be lost on those who do not sympathise with the\r\nfeelings of the poet.”\r\n\r\n“And your bard, whose effusions seemed to produce such effect upon the\r\ncompany to-day, is he reckoned among the favourite poets of the\r\nmountains?”\r\n\r\n“That is a trying question. His reputation is high among his\r\ncountrymen, and you must not expect me to depreciate it.[*]\r\n\r\n[* The Highland poet almost always was an improvisatore. Captain Burt\r\nmet one of them at Lovat’s table.]\r\n\r\n\r\n“But the song, Miss Mac-Ivor, seemed to awaken all those warriors, both\r\nyoung and old.”\r\n\r\n“The song is little more than a catalogue of names of the Highland\r\nclans under their distinctive peculiarities, and an exhortation to them\r\nto remember and to emulate the actions of their forefathers.”\r\n\r\n“And am I wrong in conjecturing, however extraordinary the guess\r\nappears, that there was some allusion to me in the verses which he\r\nrecited?”\r\n\r\n“You have a quick observation, Captain Waverley, which in this instance\r\nhas not deceived you. The Gaelic language, being uncommonly vocalic, is\r\nwell adapted for sudden and extemporaneous poetry; and a bard seldom\r\nfails to augment the effects of a premeditated song by throwing in any\r\nstanzas which may be suggested by the circumstances attending the\r\nrecitation.”\r\n\r\n“I would give my best horse to know what the Highland bard could find\r\nto say of such an unworthy Southron as myself.”\r\n\r\n“It shall not even cost you a lock of his mane. Una, _Mavourneen!_ (She\r\nspoke a few words to one of the young girls in attendance, who\r\ninstantly curtsied and tripped out of the room.) I have sent Una to\r\nlearn from the bard the expressions he used, and you shall command my\r\nskill as dragoman.”\r\n\r\nUna returned in a few minutes, and repeated to her mistress a few lines\r\nin Gaelic. Flora seemed to think for a moment, and then, slightly\r\ncolouring, she turned to Waverley—“It is impossible to gratify your\r\ncuriosity, Captain Waverley, without exposing my own presumption. If\r\nyou will give me a few moments for consideration, I will endeavour to\r\nengraft the meaning of these lines upon a rude English translation\r\nwhich I have attempted of a part of the original. The duties of the\r\ntea-table seem to be concluded, and, as the evening is delightful, Una\r\nwill show you the way to one of my favourite haunts, and Cathleen and I\r\nwill join you there.”\r\n\r\nUna, having received instructions in her native language, conducted\r\nWaverley out by a passage different from that through which he had\r\nentered the apartment. At a distance he heard the hall of the Chief\r\nstill resounding with the clang of bagpipes and the high applause of\r\nhis guests. Having gained the open air by a postern door, they walked a\r\nlittle way up the wild, bleak, and narrow valley in which the house was\r\nsituated, following the course of the stream that winded through it. In\r\na spot, about a quarter of a mile from the castle, two brooks, which\r\nformed the little river, had their junction. The larger of the two came\r\ndown the long bare valley, which extended, apparently without any\r\nchange or elevation of character, as far as the hills which formed its\r\nboundary permitted the eye to reach. But the other stream, which had\r\nits source among the mountains on the left hand of the strath, seemed\r\nto issue from a very narrow and dark opening betwixt two large rocks.\r\nThese streams were different also in character. The larger was placid,\r\nand even sullen in its course, wheeling in deep eddies, or sleeping in\r\ndark blue pools; but the motions of the lesser brook were rapid and\r\nfurious, issuing from between precipices, like a maniac from his\r\nconfinement, all foam and uproar.\r\n\r\nIt was up the course of this last stream that Waverley, like a knight\r\nof romance, was conducted by the fair Highland damsel, his silent\r\nguide. A small path, which had been rendered easy in many places for\r\nFlora’s accommodation, led him through scenery of a very different\r\ndescription from that which he had just quitted. Around the castle all\r\nwas cold, bare, and desolate, yet tame even in desolation; but this\r\nnarrow glen, at so short a distance, seemed to open into the land of\r\nromance. The rocks assumed a thousand peculiar and varied forms. In one\r\nplace a crag of huge size presented its gigantic bulk, as if to forbid\r\nthe passenger’s farther progress; and it was not until he approached\r\nits very base that Waverley discerned the sudden and acute turn by\r\nwhich the pathway wheeled its course around this formidable obstacle.\r\nIn another spot the projecting rocks from the opposite sides of the\r\nchasm had approached so near to each other that two pine-trees laid\r\nacross, and covered with turf, formed a rustic bridge at the height of\r\nat least one hundred and fifty feet. It had no ledges, and was barely\r\nthree feet in breadth.\r\n\r\nWhile gazing at this pass of peril, which crossed, like a single black\r\nline, the small portion of blue sky not intercepted by the projecting\r\nrocks on either side, it was with a sensation of horror that Waverley\r\nbeheld Flora and her attendant appear, like inhabitants of another\r\nregion, propped, as it were, in mid air, upon this trembling structure.\r\nShe stopped upon observing him below, and, with an air of graceful ease\r\nwhich made him shudder, waved her handkerchief to him by way of signal.\r\nHe was unable, from the sense of dizziness which her situation\r\nconveyed, to return the salute; and was never more relieved than when\r\nthe fair apparition passed on from the precarious eminence which she\r\nseemed to occupy with so much indifference, and disappeared on the\r\nother side.\r\n\r\nAdvancing a few yards, and passing under the bridge which he had viewed\r\nwith so much terror, the path ascended rapidly from the edge of the\r\nbrook, and the glen widened into a sylvan amphitheatre, waving with\r\nbirch, young oaks, and hazels, with here and there a scattered\r\nyew-tree. The rocks now receded, but still showed their grey and shaggy\r\ncrests rising among the copse-wood. Still higher rose eminences and\r\npeaks, some bare, some clothed with wood, some round and purple with\r\nheath, and others splintered into rocks and crags. At a short turning\r\nthe path, which had for some furlongs lost sight of the brook, suddenly\r\nplaced Waverley in front of a romantic waterfall. It was not so\r\nremarkable either for great height or quantity of water as for the\r\nbeautiful accompaniments which made the spot interesting. After a\r\nbroken cataract of about twenty feet, the stream was received in a\r\nlarge natural basin filled to the brim with water, which, where the\r\nbubbles of the fall subsided, was so exquisitely clear that, although\r\nit was of great depth, the eye could discern each pebble at the bottom.\r\nEddying round this reservoir, the brook found its way as if over a\r\nbroken part of the ledge, and formed a second fall, which seemed to\r\nseek the very abyss; then, wheeling out beneath from among the smooth\r\ndark rocks which it had polished for ages, it wandered murmuring down\r\nthe glen, forming the stream up which Waverley had just ascended.[24]\r\nThe borders of this romantic reservoir corresponded in beauty; but it\r\nwas beauty of a stern and commanding cast, as if in the act of\r\nexpanding into grandeur. Mossy banks of turf were broken and\r\ninterrupted by huge fragments of rock, and decorated with trees and\r\nshrubs, some of which had been planted under the direction of Flora,\r\nbut so cautiously that they added to the grace without diminishing the\r\nromantic wildness of the scene.\r\n\r\nHere, like one of those lovely forms which decorate the landscapes of\r\nPoussin, Waverley found Flora gazing on the waterfall. Two paces\r\nfurther back stood Cathleen, holding a small Scottish harp, the use of\r\nwhich had been taught to Flora by Rory Dall, one of the last harpers of\r\nthe Western Highlands. The sun, now stooping in the west, gave a rich\r\nand varied tinge to all the objects which surrounded Waverley, and\r\nseemed to add more than human brilliancy to the full expressive\r\ndarkness of Flora’s eye, exalted the richness and purity of her\r\ncomplexion, and enhanced the dignity and grace of her beautiful form.\r\nEdward thought he had never, even in his wildest dreams, imagined a\r\nfigure of such exquisite and interesting loveliness. The wild beauty of\r\nthe retreat, bursting upon him as if by magic, augmented the mingled\r\nfeeling of delight and awe with which he approached her, like a fair\r\nenchantress of Boiardo or Ariosto, by whose nod the scenery around\r\nseemed to have been created an Eden in the wilderness.\r\n\r\nFlora, like every beautiful woman, was conscious of her own power, and\r\npleased with its effects, which she could easily discern from the\r\nrespectful yet confused address of the young soldier. But, as she\r\npossessed excellent sense, she gave the romance of the scene and other\r\naccidental circumstances full weight in appreciating the feelings with\r\nwhich Waverley seemed obviously to be impressed; and, unacquainted with\r\nthe fanciful and susceptible peculiarities of his character, considered\r\nhis homage as the passing tribute which a woman of even inferior charms\r\nmight have expected in such a situation. She therefore quietly led the\r\nway to a spot at such a distance from the cascade that its sound should\r\nrather accompany than interrupt that of her voice and instrument, and,\r\nsitting down upon a mossy fragment of rock, she took the harp from\r\nCathleen.\r\n\r\n“I have given you the trouble of walking to this spot, Captain\r\nWaverley, both because I thought the scenery would interest you, and\r\nbecause a Highland song would suffer still more from my imperfect\r\ntranslation were I to introduce it without its own wild and appropriate\r\naccompaniments. To speak in the poetical language of my country, the\r\nseat of the Celtic Muse is in the mist of the secret and solitary hill,\r\nand her voice in the murmur of the mountain stream. He who woos her\r\nmust love the barren rock more than the fertile valley, and the\r\nsolitude of the desert better than the festivity of the hall.”\r\n\r\nFew could have heard this lovely woman make this declaration, with a\r\nvoice where harmony was exalted by pathos, without exclaiming that the\r\nmuse whom she invoked could never find a more appropriate\r\nrepresentative. But Waverley, though the thought rushed on his mind,\r\nfound no courage to utter it. Indeed, the wild feeling of romantic\r\ndelight with which he heard the few first notes she drew from her\r\ninstrument amounted almost to a sense of pain. He would not for worlds\r\nhave quitted his place by her side; yet he almost longed for solitude,\r\nthat he might decipher and examine at leisure the complication of\r\nemotions which now agitated his bosom.\r\n\r\nFlora had exchanged the measured and monotonous recitative of the bard\r\nfor a lofty and uncommon Highland air, which had been a battle-song in\r\nformer ages. A few irregular strains introduced a prelude of a wild and\r\npeculiar tone, which harmonised well with the distant waterfall, and\r\nthe soft sigh of the evening breeze in the rustling leaves of an aspen,\r\nwhich overhung the seat of the fair harpress. The following verses\r\nconvey but little idea of the feelings with which, so sung and\r\naccompanied, they were heard by Waverley:—\r\n\r\nThere is mist on the mountain, and night on the vale,\r\nBut more dark is the sleep of the sons of the Gael.\r\nA stranger commanded—it sunk on the land,\r\nIt has frozen each heart, and benumb’d every hand!\r\n\r\nThe dirk and the target lie sordid with dust,\r\nThe bloodless claymore is but redden’d with rust;\r\nOn the hill or the glen if a gun should appear,\r\nIt is only to war with the heath-cock or deer.\r\n\r\nThe deeds of our sires if our bards should rehearse,\r\nLet a blush or a blow be the meed of their verse!\r\nBe mute every string, and be hush’d every tone,\r\nThat shall bid us remember the fame that is flown.\r\n\r\nBut the dark hours of night and of slumber are past,\r\nThe morn on our mountains is dawning at last;\r\nGlenaladale’s peaks are illumined with the rays,\r\nAnd the streams of Glenfinnan[*] leap bright in the blaze.\r\n\r\nO high-minded Moray,[**] the exiled! the dear!\r\nIn the blush of the dawning the STANDARD uprear!\r\nWide, wide on the winds of the North let it fly,\r\nLike the sun’s latest flash when the tempest is nigh!\r\n\r\nYe sons of the strong, when that dawning shall break,\r\nNeed the harp of the aged remind you to wake?\r\nThat dawn never beam’d on your forefathers’ eye,\r\nBut it roused each high chieftain to vanquish or die.\r\n\r\nO, sprung from the Kings who in Islay kept state,\r\nProud chiefs of Clan Ranald, Glengarry, and Sleat!\r\nCombine like three streams from one mountain of snow,\r\nAnd resistless in union rush down on the foe!\r\n\r\nTrue son of Sir Evan, undaunted Lochiel,\r\nPlace thy targe on thy shoulder and burnish thy steel!\r\nRough Keppoch, give breath to thy bugle’s bold swell,\r\nTill far Coryarrick resound to the knell!\r\n\r\nStern son of Lord Kenneth, high chief of Kintail,\r\nLet the stag in thy standard bound wild in the gale!\r\nMay the race of Clan Gillean, the fearless and free,\r\nRemember Glenlivat, Harlaw, and Dundee!\r\n\r\nLet the clan of grey Fingon, whose offspring has given\r\nSuch heroes to earth and such martyrs to heaven,\r\nUnite with the race of renown’d Rorri More,\r\nTo launch the long galley and stretch to the oar.\r\n\r\nHow Mac-Shimei will joy when their chief shall display\r\nThe yew-crested bonnet o’er tresses of grey!\r\nHow the race of wrong’d Alpine and murder’d Glencoe\r\nShall shout for revenge when they pour on the foe!\r\n\r\nYe sons of brown Dermid, who slew the wild boar,\r\nResume the pure faith of the great Callum-More!\r\nMac-Neil of the islands, and Moy of the Lake,\r\nFor honour, for freedom, for vengeance awake!\r\n\r\n\r\n[* The young and daring adventurer, Charles Edward, landed at\r\nGlenaladale, in Moidart, and displayed his standard in the valley of\r\nGlenfinnan, mustering around it the Mac-Donalds, the Camerons, and\r\nother less numerous clans, whom he had prevailed on to join him. There\r\nis a monument erected on the spot, with a Latin inscription by the late\r\nDoctor Gregory.]\r\n\r\n[** The Marquis of Tullibardine’s elder brother, who, long exiled,\r\nreturned to Scotland with Charles Edward in 1745.]\r\n\r\nHere a large greyhound, bounding up the glen, jumped upon Flora and\r\ninterrupted her music by his importunate caresses. At a distant whistle\r\nhe turned and shot down the path again with the rapidity of an arrow.\r\n“That is Fergus’s faithful attendant, Captain Waverley, and that was\r\nhis signal. He likes no poetry but what is humorous, and comes in good\r\ntime to interrupt my long catalogue of the tribes, whom one of your\r\nsaucy English poets calls\r\n\r\n“‘Our bootless host of high-born beggars,\r\nMac-Leans, Mac-Kenzies, and Mac-Gregors.’”\r\n\r\n\r\nWaverley expressed his regret at the interruption.\r\n\r\n“O you cannot guess how much you have lost! The bard, as in duty bound,\r\nhas addressed three long stanzas to Vich Ian Vohr of the Banners,\r\nenumerating all his great properties, and not forgetting his being a\r\ncheerer of the harper and bard—‘a giver of bounteous gifts.’ Besides,\r\nyou should have heard a practical admonition to the fair-haired son of\r\nthe stranger, who lives in the land where the grass is always green—the\r\nrider on the shining pampered steed, whose hue is like the raven, and\r\nwhose neigh is like the scream of the eagle for battle. This valiant\r\nhorseman is affectionately conjured to remember that his ancestors were\r\ndistinguished by their loyalty as well as by their courage. All this\r\nyou have lost; but, since your curiosity is not satisfied, I judge,\r\nfrom the distant sound of my brother’s whistle, I may have time to sing\r\nthe concluding stanzas before he comes to laugh at my translation.”\r\n\r\n“Awake on your hills, on your islands awake,\r\nBrave sons of the mountain, the frith, and the lake!\r\n’T is the bugle—but not for the chase is the call;\r\n’T is the pibroch’s shrill summons—but not to the hall.\r\n\r\n“’T is the summons of heroes for conquest or death,\r\nWhen the banners are blazing on mountain and heath:\r\nThey call to the dirk, the claymore, and the targe,\r\nTo the march and the muster, the line and the charge.\r\n\r\n“Be the brand of each chieftain like Fin’s in his ire!\r\nMay the blood through his veins flow like currents of fire!\r\nBurst the base foreign yoke as your sires did of yore,\r\nOr die like your sires, and endure it no more!\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXIII.\r\nWAVERLEY CONTINUES AT GLENNAQUOICH\r\n\r\n\r\nAs Flora concluded her song, Fergus stood before them. “I knew I should\r\nfind you here, even without the assistance of my friend Bran. A simple\r\nand unsublimed taste now, like my own, would prefer a _jet d’eau_ at\r\nVersailles to this cascade, with all its accompaniments of rock and\r\nroar; but this is Flora’s Parnassus, Captain Waverley, and that\r\nfountain her Helicon. It would be greatly for the benefit of my cellar\r\nif she could teach her coadjutor, Mac-Murrough, the value of its\r\ninfluence: he has just drunk a pint of usquebaugh to correct, he said,\r\nthe coldness of the claret. Let me try its virtues.” He sipped a little\r\nwater in the hollow of his hand, and immediately commenced, with a\r\ntheatrical air,—\r\n\r\n“O Lady of the desert, hail!\r\nThat lovest the harping of the Gael,\r\nThrough fair and fertile regions borne,\r\nWhere never yet grew grass or corn.\r\n\r\n\r\nBut English poetry will never succeed under the influence of a Highland\r\nHelicon. _Allons, courage!_\r\n\r\nO vous, qui buvez, à tasse pleine,\r\nA cette heureuse fontaine,\r\nOù on ne voit, sur le rivage,\r\n    Que quelques vilains troupeaux,\r\nSuivis de nymphes de village,\r\n    Qui les escortent sans sabots—”\r\n\r\n\r\n“A truce, dear Fergus! spare us those most tedious and insipid persons\r\nof all Arcadia. Do not, for Heaven’s sake, bring down Coridon and\r\nLindor upon us.”\r\n\r\n“Nay, if you cannot relish _la houlette et le chalumeau_, have with you\r\nin heroic strains.”\r\n\r\n“Dear Fergus, you have certainly partaken of the inspiration of\r\nMac-Murrough’s cup rather than of mine.”\r\n\r\n“I disclaim it, _ma belle demoiselle_, although I protest it would be\r\nthe more congenial of the two. Which of your crack-brained Italian\r\nromancers is it that says,\r\n\r\nIo d’Elicona niente\r\nMi curo, in fe de Dio; che’l bere d’acque\r\n(Bea chi ber ne vuol) sempre mi spiacque![*]\r\n\r\n\r\n[* Good sooth, I reck nought of your Helicon;\r\nDrink water whoso will, in faith I will drink none.]\r\n\r\n\r\nBut if you prefer the Gaelic, Captain Waverley, here is little Cathleen\r\nshall sing you Drimmindhu. Come, Cathleen, _astore_ (that is, my dear),\r\nbegin; no apologies to the _Cean-kinné_.”\r\n\r\nCathleen sung with much liveliness a little Gaelic song, the burlesque\r\nelegy of a countryman on the loss of his cow, the comic tones of which,\r\nthough he did not understand the language, made Waverley laugh more\r\nthan once.[*]\r\n\r\n[* This ancient Gaelic ditty is still well known, both in the Highlands\r\nand in Ireland. It was translated into English, and published, if I\r\nmistake not, under the auspices of the facetious Tom D’Urfey, by the\r\ntitle of “Colley, my Cow.”]\r\n\r\n\r\n“Admirable, Cathleen!” cried the Chieftain; “I must find you a handsome\r\nhusband among the clansmen one of these days.”\r\n\r\nCathleen laughed, blushed, and sheltered herself behind her companion.\r\n\r\nIn the progress of their return to the castle, the Chieftain warmly\r\npressed Waverley to remain for a week or two, in order to see a grand\r\nhunting party, in which he and some other Highland gentlemen proposed\r\nto join. The charms of melody and beauty were too strongly impressed in\r\nEdward’s breast to permit his declining an invitation so pleasing. It\r\nwas agreed, therefore, that he should write a note to the Baron of\r\nBradwardine, expressing his intention to stay a fortnight at\r\nGlennaquoich, and requesting him to forward by the bearer (a _gilly_ of\r\nthe Chieftain’s) any letters which might have arrived for him.\r\n\r\nThis turned the discourse upon the Baron, whom Fergus highly extolled\r\nas a gentleman and soldier. His character was touched with yet more\r\ndiscrimination by Flora, who observed he was the very model of the old\r\nScottish cavalier, with all his excellencies and peculiarities. “It is\r\na character, Captain Waverley, which is fast disappearing; for its best\r\npoint was a self-respect which was never lost sight of till now. But in\r\nthe present time the gentlemen whose principles do not permit them to\r\npay court to the existing government are neglected and degraded, and\r\nmany conduct themselves accordingly; and, like some of the persons you\r\nhave seen at Tully-Veolan, adopt habits and companions inconsistent\r\nwith their birth and breeding. The ruthless proscription of party seems\r\nto degrade the victims whom it brands, however unjustly. But let us\r\nhope a brighter day is approaching, when a Scottish country gentleman\r\nmay be a scholar without the pedantry of our friend the Baron, a\r\nsportsman without the low habits of Mr. Falconer, and a judicious\r\nimprover of his property without becoming a boorish two-legged steer\r\nlike Killancureit.”\r\n\r\nThus did Flora prophesy a revolution, which time indeed has produced,\r\nbut in a manner very different from what she had in her mind.\r\n\r\nThe amiable Rose was next mentioned, with the warmest encomium on her\r\nperson, manners, and mind. “That man,” said Flora, “will find an\r\ninestimable treasure in the affections of Rose Bradwardine who shall be\r\nso fortunate as to become their object. Her very soul is in home, and\r\nin the discharge of all those quiet virtues of which home is the\r\ncentre. Her husband will be to her what her father now is, the object\r\nof all her care, solicitude, and affection. She will see nothing, and\r\nconnect herself with nothing, but by him and through him. If he is a\r\nman of sense and virtue, she will sympathise in his sorrows, divert his\r\nfatigue, and share his pleasures. If she becomes the property of a\r\nchurlish or negligent husband, she will suit his taste also, for she\r\nwill not long survive his unkindness. And, alas! how great is the\r\nchance that some such unworthy lot may be that of my poor friend! O\r\nthat I were a queen this moment, and could command the most amiable and\r\nworthy youth of my kingdom to accept happiness with the hand of Rose\r\nBradwardine!”\r\n\r\n“I wish you would command her to accept mine _en attendant_,” said\r\nFergus, laughing.\r\n\r\nI don’t know by what caprice it was that this wish, however jocularly\r\nexpressed, rather jarred on Edward’s feelings, notwithstanding his\r\ngrowing inclination to Flora and his indifference to Miss Bradwardine.\r\nThis is one of the inexplicabilities of human nature, which we leave\r\nwithout comment.\r\n\r\n“Yours, brother?” answered Flora, regarding him steadily. “No; you have\r\nanother bride—Honour; and the dangers you must run in pursuit of her\r\nrival would break poor Rose’s heart.”\r\n\r\nWith this discourse they reached the castle, and Waverley soon prepared\r\nhis despatches for Tully-Veolan. As he knew the Baron was punctilious\r\nin such matters, he was about to impress his billet with a seal on\r\nwhich his armorial bearings were engraved, but he did not find it at\r\nhis watch, and thought he must have left it at Tully-Veolan. He\r\nmentioned his loss, borrowing at the same time the family seal of the\r\nChieftain.\r\n\r\n“Surely,” said Miss Mac-Ivor, “Donald Bean Lean would not—”\r\n\r\n“My life for him in such circumstances,” answered her brother;\r\n“besides, he would never have left the watch behind.”\r\n\r\n“After all, Fergus,” said Flora, “and with every allowance, I am\r\nsurprised you can countenance that man.”\r\n\r\n“I countenance him? This kind sister of mine would persuade you,\r\nCaptain Waverley, that I take what the people of old used to call “a\r\nsteakraid,” that is, a “collop of the foray,” or, in plainer words, a\r\nportion of the robber’s booty, paid by him to the Laird, or Chief,\r\nthrough whose grounds he drove his prey. O, it is certain that, unless\r\nI can find some way to charm Flora’s tongue, General Blakeney will send\r\na sergeant’s party from Stirling (this he said with haughty and\r\nemphatic irony) to seize Vich Ian Vohr, as they nickname me, in his own\r\ncastle.”\r\n\r\n“Now, Fergus, must not our guest be sensible that all this is folly and\r\naffectation? You have men enough to serve you without enlisting\r\nbanditti, and your own honour is above taint. Why don’t you send this\r\nDonald Bean Lean, whom I hate for his smoothness and duplicity even\r\nmore than for his rapine, out of your country at once? No cause should\r\ninduce me to tolerate such a character.”\r\n\r\n“_No_ cause, Flora?” said the Chieftain significantly.\r\n\r\n“No cause, Fergus! not even that which is nearest to my heart. Spare it\r\nthe omen of such evil supporters!”\r\n\r\n“O but, sister,” rejoined the Chief gaily, “you don’t consider my\r\nrespect for _la belle passion_. Evan Dhu Maccombich is in love with\r\nDonald’s daughter, Alice, and you cannot expect me to disturb him in\r\nhis amours. Why, the whole clan would cry shame on me. You know it is\r\none of their wise sayings, that a kinsman is part of a man’s body, but\r\na foster-brother is a piece of his heart.”\r\n\r\n“Well, Fergus, there is no disputing with you; but I would all this may\r\nend well.”\r\n\r\n“Devoutly prayed, my dear and prophetic sister, and the best way in the\r\nworld to close a dubious argument. But hear ye not the pipes, Captain\r\nWaverley? Perhaps you will like better to dance to them in the hall\r\nthan to be deafened with their harmony without taking part in the\r\nexercise they invite us to.”\r\n\r\nWaverley took Flora’s hand. The dance, song, and merry-making\r\nproceeded, and closed the day’s entertainment at the castle of Vich Ian\r\nVohr. Edward at length retired, his mind agitated by a variety of new\r\nand conflicting feelings, which detained him from rest for some time,\r\nin that not unpleasing state of mind in which fancy takes the helm, and\r\nthe soul rather drifts passively along with the rapid and confused tide\r\nof reflections than exerts itself to encounter, systematise, or examine\r\nthem. At a late hour he fell asleep, and dreamed of Flora Mac-Ivor.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXIV.\r\nA STAG-HUNT AND ITS CONSEQUENCES\r\n\r\n\r\nShall this be a long or a short chapter? This is a question in which\r\nyou, gentle reader, have no vote, however much you may be interested in\r\nthe consequences; just as you may (like myself) probably have nothing\r\nto do with the imposing a new tax, excepting the trifling circumstance\r\nof being obliged to pay it. More happy surely in the present case,\r\nsince, though it lies within my arbitrary power to extend my materials\r\nas I think proper, I cannot call you into Exchequer if you do not think\r\nproper to read my narrative. Let me therefore consider. It is true that\r\nthe annals and documents in my hands say but little of this Highland\r\nchase; but then I can find copious materials for description elsewhere.\r\nThere is old Lindsay of Pitscottie ready at my elbow, with his Athole\r\nhunting, and his “lofted and joisted palace of green timber; with all\r\nkind of drink to be had in burgh and land, as ale, beer, wine,\r\nmuscadel, malvaise, hippocras, and aqua-vitæ; with wheat-bread,\r\nmain-bread, ginge-bread, beef, mutton, lamb, veal, venison, goose,\r\ngrice, capon, coney, crane, swan, partridge, plover, duck, drake,\r\nbrissel-cock, pawnies, black-cock, muir-fowl, and capercailzies”; not\r\nforgetting the “costly bedding, vaiselle, and napry,” and least of all\r\nthe “excelling stewards, cunning baxters, excellent cooks, and\r\npottingars, with confections and drugs for the desserts.” Besides the\r\nparticulars which may be thence gleaned for this Highland feast (the\r\nsplendour of which induced the Pope’s legate to dissent from an opinion\r\nwhich he had hitherto held, that Scotland, namely, was the—the—the\r\nlatter end of the world)—besides these, might I not illuminate my pages\r\nwith Taylor the Water Poet’s hunting in the braes of Mar, where,—\r\n\r\nThrough heather, mosse, ’mong frogs, and bogs, and fogs,\r\n    ’Mongst craggy cliffs and thunder-batter’d hills,\r\nHares, hinds, bucks, roes, are chased by men and dogs,\r\n    Where two hours’ hunting fourscore fat deer kills.\r\nLowland, your sports are low as is your seat;\r\nThe Highland games and minds are high and great.\r\n\r\n\r\nBut without further tyranny over my readers, or display of the extent\r\nof my own reading, I shall content myself with borrowing a single\r\nincident from the memorable hunting at Lude, commemorated in the\r\ningenious Mr. Gunn’s essay on the Caledonian Harp, and so proceed in my\r\nstory with all the brevity that my natural style of composition,\r\npartaking of what scholars call the periphrastic and ambagitory, and\r\nthe vulgar the circumbendibus, will permit me.\r\n\r\nThe solemn hunting was delayed, from various causes, for about three\r\nweeks. The interval was spent by Waverley with great satisfaction at\r\nGlennaquoich; for the impression which Flora had made on his mind at\r\ntheir first meeting grew daily stronger. She was precisely the\r\ncharacter to fascinate a youth of romantic imagination. Her manners,\r\nher language, her talents for poetry and music, gave additional and\r\nvaried influence to her eminent personal charms. Even in her hours of\r\ngaiety she was in his fancy exalted above the ordinary daughters of\r\nEve, and seemed only to stoop for an instant to those topics of\r\namusement and gallantry which others appear to live for. In the\r\nneighbourhood of this enchantress, while sport consumed the morning and\r\nmusic and the dance led on the hours of evening, Waverley became daily\r\nmore delighted with his hospitable landlord, and more enamoured of his\r\nbewitching sister.\r\n\r\nAt length the period fixed for the grand hunting arrived, and Waverley\r\nand the Chieftain departed for the place of rendezvous, which was a\r\nday’s journey to the northward of Glennaquoich. Fergus was attended on\r\nthis occasion by about three hundred of his clan, well armed and\r\naccoutred in their best fashion. Waverley complied so far with the\r\ncustom of the country as to adopt the trews (he could not be reconciled\r\nto the kilt), brogues, and bonnet, as the fittest dress for the\r\nexercise in which he was to be engaged, and which least exposed him to\r\nbe stared at as a stranger when they should reach the place of\r\nrendezvous. They found on the spot appointed several powerful Chiefs,\r\nto all of whom Waverley was formally presented, and by all cordially\r\nreceived. Their vassals and clansmen, a part of whose feudal duty it\r\nwas to attend on these parties, appeared in such numbers as amounted to\r\na small army. These active assistants spread through the country far\r\nand near, forming a circle, technically called the “tinchel,” which,\r\ngradually closing, drove the deer in herds together towards the glen\r\nwhere the Chiefs and principal sportsmen lay in wait for them. In the\r\nmeanwhile these distinguished personages bivouacked among the flowery\r\nheath, wrapped up in their plaids, a mode of passing a summer’s night\r\nwhich Waverley found by no means unpleasant.\r\n\r\nFor many hours after sunrise the mountain ridges and passes retained\r\ntheir ordinary appearance of silence and solitude, and the Chiefs, with\r\ntheir followers, amused themselves with various pastimes, in which the\r\njoys of the shell, as Ossian has it, were not forgotten. “Others apart\r\nsat on a hill retired,” probably as deeply engaged in the discussion\r\nof politics and news as Milton’s spirits in metaphysical disquisition.\r\nAt length signals of the approach of the game were descried and heard.\r\nDistant shouts resounded from valley to valley, as the various parties\r\nof Highlanders, climbing rocks, struggling through copses, wading\r\nbrooks, and traversing thickets, approached more and more near to each\r\nother, and compelled the astonished deer, with the other wild animals\r\nthat fled before them, into a narrower circuit. Every now and then the\r\nreport of muskets was heard, repeated by a thousand echoes. The baying\r\nof the dogs was soon added to the chorus, which grew ever louder and\r\nmore loud. At length the advanced parties of the deer began to show\r\nthemselves; and as the stragglers came bounding down the pass by two or\r\nthree at a time, the Chiefs showed their skill by distinguishing the\r\nfattest deer, and their dexterity in bringing them down with their\r\nguns. Fergus exhibited remarkable address, and Edward was also so\r\nfortunate as to attract the notice and applause of the sportsmen.\r\n\r\nBut now the main body of the deer appeared at the head of the glen,\r\ncompelled into a very narrow compass, and presenting such a formidable\r\nphalanx that their antlers appeared at a distance, over the ridge of\r\nthe steep pass, like a leafless grove. Their number was very great, and\r\nfrom a desperate stand which they made, with the tallest of the\r\nred-deer stags arranged in front, in a sort of battle-array, gazing on\r\nthe group which barred their passage down the glen, the more\r\nexperienced sportsmen began to augur danger. The work of destruction,\r\nhowever, now commenced on all sides. Dogs and hunters were at work, and\r\nmuskets and fusees resounded from every quarter. The deer, driven to\r\ndesperation, made at length a fearful charge right upon the spot where\r\nthe more distinguished sportsmen had taken their stand. The word was\r\ngiven in Gaelic to fling themselves upon their faces; but Waverley, on\r\nwhose English ears the signal was lost, had almost fallen a sacrifice\r\nto his ignorance of the ancient language in which it was communicated.\r\nFergus, observing his danger, sprung up and pulled him with violence to\r\nthe ground, just as the whole herd broke down upon them. The tide being\r\nabsolutely irresistible, and wounds from a stag’s horn highly\r\ndangerous,[*] the activity of the Chieftain may be considered, on this\r\noccasion, as having saved his guest’s life. He detained him with a firm\r\ngrasp until the whole herd of deer had fairly run over them. Waverley\r\nthen attempted to rise, but found that he had suffered several very\r\nsevere contusions, and, upon a further examination, discovered that he\r\nhad sprained his ankle violently.\r\n\r\n[* The thrust from the tynes, or branches, of the stag’s horns was\r\naccounted far more dangerous than those of the boar’s tusk:—\r\n\r\n\r\nIf thou be hurt with horn of stag, it brings thee to thy bier,\r\nBut barber’s hand shall boar’s hurt heal, thereof have thou no fear.]\r\n\r\n\r\nThis checked the mirth of the meeting, although the Highlanders,\r\naccustomed to such incidents, and prepared for them, had suffered no\r\nharm themselves. A wigwam was erected almost in an instant, where\r\nEdward was deposited on a couch of heather. The surgeon, or he who\r\nassumed the office, appeared to unite the characters of a leech and a\r\nconjuror. He was an old smoke-dried Highlander, wearing a venerable\r\ngrey beard, and having for his sole garment a tartan frock, the skirts\r\nof which descended to the knee, and, being undivided in front, made the\r\nvestment serve at once for doublet and breeches.[*] He observed great\r\nceremony in approaching Edward; and though our hero was writhing with\r\npain, would not proceed to any operation which might assuage it until\r\nhe had perambulated his couch three times, moving from east to west,\r\naccording to the course of the sun. This, which was called making the\r\n“deasil,”[**] both the leech and the assistants seemed to consider as a\r\nmatter of the last importance to the accomplishment of a cure; and\r\nWaverley, whom pain rendered incapable of expostulation, and who indeed\r\nsaw no chance of its being attended to, submitted in silence.\r\n\r\n[* This garb, which resembled the dress often put on children in\r\nScotland, called a “polonie” (that is, “polonaise”), is a very ancient\r\nmodification of the Highland garb. It was, in fact, the hauberk or\r\nshirt of mail, only composed of cloth instead of rings of armour.]\r\n\r\n\r\n[** Old Highlanders will still make the “deasil” around those whom they\r\nwish well to. To go round a person in the opposite direction, or\r\nwither-shins (German _wider-shins_), is unlucky, and a sort of\r\nincantation.]\r\n\r\n\r\nAfter this ceremony was duly performed, the old Esculapius let his\r\npatient’s blood with a cupping-glass with great dexterity, and\r\nproceeded, muttering all the while to himself in Gaelic, to boil on the\r\nfire certain herbs, with which he compounded an embrocation. He then\r\nfomented the parts which had sustained injury, never failing to murmur\r\nprayers or spells, which of the two Waverley could not distinguish, as\r\nhis ear only caught the words Gasper-Melchior-Balthazar-max-prax-fax,\r\nand similar gibberish. The fomentation had a speedy effect in\r\nalleviating the pain and swelling, which our hero imputed to the virtue\r\nof the herbs or the effect of the chafing, but which was by the\r\nbystanders unanimously ascribed to the spells with which the operation\r\nhad been accompanied. Edward was given to understand that not one of\r\nthe ingredients had been gathered except during the full moon, and that\r\nthe herbalist had, while collecting them, uniformly recited a charm,\r\nwhich in English ran thus:—\r\n\r\nHail to thee, thou holy herb,\r\nThat sprung on holy ground!\r\nAll in the Mount Olivet\r\nFirst wert thou found.\r\nThou art boot for many a bruise,\r\nAnd healest many a wound;\r\nIn our Lady’s blessed name,\r\nI take thee from the ground.[*]\r\n\r\n\r\n[* This metrical spell, or something very like it, is preserved by\r\nReginald Scott in his work on Witchcraft.]\r\n\r\n\r\nEdward observed with some surprise that even Fergus, notwithstanding\r\nhis knowledge and education, seemed to fall in with the superstitious\r\nideas of his countrymen, either because he deemed it impolitic to\r\naffect scepticism on a matter of general belief, or more probably\r\nbecause, like most men who do not think deeply or accurately on such\r\nsubjects, he had in his mind a reserve of superstition which balanced\r\nthe freedom of his expressions and practice upon other occasions.\r\nWaverley made no commentary, therefore, on the manner of the treatment,\r\nbut rewarded the professor of medicine with a liberality beyond the\r\nutmost conception of his wildest hopes. He uttered on the occasion so\r\nmany incoherent blessings in Gaelic and English that Mac-Ivor, rather\r\nscandalized at the excess of his acknowledgments, cut them short by\r\nexclaiming, “Ceud mile mhalloich ort!” (that is, “A hundred thousand\r\ncurses on you!”) and so pushed the helper of men out of the cabin.\r\n\r\nAfter Waverley was left alone, the exhaustion of pain and fatigue—for\r\nthe whole day’s exercise had been severe—threw him into a profound, but\r\nyet a feverish sleep, which he chiefly owed to an opiate draught\r\nadministered by the old Highlander from some decoction of herbs in his\r\npharmacopœia.\r\n\r\nEarly the next morning, the purpose of their meeting being over, and\r\ntheir sports damped by the untoward accident, in which Fergus and all\r\nhis friends expressed the greatest sympathy, it became a question how\r\nto dispose of the disabled sportsman. This was settled by Mac-Ivor, who\r\nhad a litter prepared, of “birch and hazel-grey,”[*] which was borne by\r\nhis people with such caution and dexterity as renders it not improbable\r\nthat they may have been the ancestors of some of those sturdy Gael who\r\nhave now the happiness to transport the belles of Edinburgh in their\r\nsedan-chairs to ten routs in one evening. When Edward was elevated upon\r\ntheir shoulders he could not help being gratified with the romantic\r\neffect produced by the breaking up of this sylvan camp.[25]\r\n\r\n[* On the morrow they made their biers\r\nOf birch and hazel grey.\r\n_Chevy Chase_.]\r\n\r\nThe various tribes assembled, each at the pibroch of their native clan,\r\nand each headed by their patriarchal ruler. Some, who had already begun\r\nto retire, were seen winding up the hills, or descending the passes\r\nwhich led to the scene of action, the sound of their bagpipes dying\r\nupon the ear. Others made still a moving picture upon the narrow plain,\r\nforming various changeful groups, their feathers and loose plaids\r\nwaving in the morning breeze, and their arms glittering in the rising\r\nsun. Most of the Chiefs came to take farewell of Waverley, and to\r\nexpress their anxious hope they might again, and speedily, meet; but\r\nthe care of Fergus abridged the ceremony of taking leave. At length,\r\nhis own men being completely assembled and mustered, Mac-Ivor commenced\r\nhis march, but not towards the quarter from which they had come. He\r\ngave Edward to understand that the greater part of his followers now on\r\nthe field were bound on a distant expedition, and that when he had\r\ndeposited him in the house of a gentleman, who he was sure would pay\r\nhim every attention, he himself should be under the necessity of\r\naccompanying them the greater part of the way, but would lose no time\r\nin rejoining his friend.\r\n\r\nWaverley was rather surprised that Fergus had not mentioned this\r\nulterior destination when they set out upon the hunting-party; but his\r\nsituation did not admit of many interrogatories. The greater part of\r\nthe clansmen went forward under the guidance of old Ballenkeiroch and\r\nEvan Dhu Maccombich, apparently in high spirits. A few remained for the\r\npurpose of escorting the Chieftain, who walked by the side of Edward’s\r\nlitter, and attended him with the most affectionate assiduity. About\r\nnoon, after a journey which the nature of the conveyance, the pain of\r\nhis bruises, and the roughness of the way rendered inexpressibly\r\npainful, Waverley was hospitably received into the house of a gentleman\r\nrelated to Fergus, who had prepared for him every accommodation which\r\nthe simple habits of living then universal in the Highlands put in his\r\npower. In this person, an old man about seventy, Edward admired a relic\r\nof primitive simplicity. He wore no dress but what his estate afforded;\r\nthe cloth was the fleece of his own sheep, woven by his own servants,\r\nand stained into tartan by the dyes produced from the herbs and lichens\r\nof the hills around him. His linen was spun by his daughters and\r\nmaidservants, from his own flax; nor did his table, though plentiful,\r\nand varied with game and fish, offer an article but what was of native\r\nproduce.\r\n\r\nClaiming himself no rights of clanship or vassalage, he was fortunate\r\nin the alliance and protection of Vich Ian Vohr and other bold and\r\nenterprising Chieftains, who protected him in the quiet unambitious\r\nlife he loved. It is true, the youth born on his grounds were often\r\nenticed to leave him for the service of his more active friends; but a\r\nfew old servants and tenants used to shake their grey locks when they\r\nheard their master censured for want of spirit, and observed, “When the\r\nwind is still, the shower falls soft.” This good old man, whose charity\r\nand hospitality were unbounded, would have received Waverley with\r\nkindness had he been the meanest Saxon peasant, since his situation\r\nrequired assistance. But his attention to a friend and guest of Vich\r\nIan Vohr was anxious and unremitted. Other embrocations were applied to\r\nthe injured limb, and new spells were put in practice. At length, after\r\nmore solicitude than was perhaps for the advantage of his health,\r\nFergus took farewell of Edward for a few days, when, he said, he would\r\nreturn to Tomanrait, and hoped by that time Waverley would be able to\r\nride one of the Highland ponies of his landlord, and in that manner\r\nreturn to Glennaquoich.\r\n\r\nThe next day, when his good old host appeared, Edward learned that his\r\nfriend had departed with the dawn, leaving none of his followers except\r\nCallum Beg, the sort of foot-page who used to attend his person, and\r\nwho had now in charge to wait upon Waverley. On asking his host if he\r\nknew where the Chieftain was gone, the old man looked fixedly at him,\r\nwith something mysterious and sad in the smile which was his only\r\nreply. Waverley repeated his question, to which his host answered in a\r\nproverb,—\r\n\r\nWhat sent the messengers to hell,\r\nWas asking what they knew full well.[*]\r\n\r\n\r\n[* Corresponding to the Lowland saying, “Mony ane speirs the gate they\r\nken fu’ weel.”]\r\n\r\n\r\nHe was about to proceed, but Callum Beg said, rather pertly, as Edward\r\nthought, that “Ta Tighearnach (i.e. the Chief) did not like ta\r\nSassenagh _duinhé-wassel_ to be pingled wi’ mickle speaking, as she was\r\nna tat weel.” From this Waverley concluded he should disoblige his\r\nfriend by inquiring of a stranger the object of a journey which he\r\nhimself had not communicated.\r\n\r\nIt is unnecessary to trace the progress of our hero’s recovery. The\r\nsixth morning had arrived, and he was able to walk about with a staff,\r\nwhen Fergus returned with about a score of his men. He seemed in the\r\nhighest spirits, congratulated Waverley on his progress towards\r\nrecovery, and finding he was able to sit on horseback, proposed their\r\nimmediate return to Glennaquoich. Waverley joyfully acceded, for the\r\nform of its fair mistress had lived in his dreams during all the time\r\nof his confinement.\r\n\r\nNow he has ridden o’er moor and moss,\r\nO’er hill and many a glen,\r\n\r\n\r\nFergus, all the while, with his myrmidons, striding stoutly by his\r\nside, or diverging to get a shot at a roe or a heath-cock. Waverley’s\r\nbosom beat thick when they approached the old tower of Ian nan\r\nChaistel, and could distinguish the fair form of its mistress advancing\r\nto meet them.\r\n\r\nFergus began immediately, with his usual high spirits, to exclaim,\r\n“Open your gates, incomparable princess, to the wounded Moor Abindarez,\r\nwhom Rodrigo de Narvez, constable of Antiquera, conveys to your castle;\r\nor open them, if you like it better, to the renowned Marquis of Mantua,\r\nthe sad attendant of his half-slain friend Baldovinos of the Mountain.\r\nAh, long rest to thy soul, Cervantes! without quoting thy remnants, how\r\nshould I frame my language to befit romantic ears!”\r\n\r\nFlora now advanced, and welcoming Waverley with much kindness,\r\nexpressed her regret for his accident, of which she had already heard\r\nparticulars, and her surprise that her brother should not have taken\r\nbetter care to put a stranger on his guard against the perils of the\r\nsport in which he engaged him. Edward easily exculpated the Chieftain,\r\nwho, indeed, at his own personal risk, had probably saved his life.\r\n\r\nThis greeting over, Fergus said three or four words to his sister in\r\nGaelic. The tears instantly sprung to her eyes, but they seemed to be\r\ntears of devotion and joy, for she looked up to heaven and folded her\r\nhands as in a solemn expression of prayer or gratitude. After the pause\r\nof a minute, she presented to Edward some letters which had been\r\nforwarded from Tully-Veolan during his absence, and at the same time\r\ndelivered some to her brother. To the latter she likewise gave three or\r\nfour numbers of the “Caledonian Mercury,” the only newspaper which was\r\nthen published to the north of the Tweed.\r\n\r\nBoth gentlemen retired to examine their despatches, and Edward speedily\r\nfound that those which he had received contained matters of very deep\r\ninterest.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXV.\r\nNEWS FROM ENGLAND\r\n\r\n\r\nThe letters which Waverley had hitherto received from his relations in\r\nEngland were not such as required any particular notice in this\r\nnarrative. His father usually wrote to him with the pompous affectation\r\nof one who was too much oppressed by public affairs to find leisure to\r\nattend to those of his own family. Now and then he mentioned persons of\r\nrank in Scotland to whom he wished his son should pay some attention;\r\nbut Waverley, hitherto occupied by the amusements which he had found at\r\nTully-Veolan and Glennaquoich, dispensed with paying any attention to\r\nhints so coldly thrown out, especially as distance, shortness of leave\r\nof absence, and so forth furnished a ready apology. But latterly the\r\nburden of Mr. Richard Waverley’s paternal epistles consisted in certain\r\nmysterious hints of greatness and influence which he was speedily to\r\nattain, and which would ensure his son’s obtaining the most rapid\r\npromotion, should he remain in the military service. Sir Everard’s\r\nletters were of a different tenor. They were short; for the good\r\nBaronet was none of your illimitable correspondents, whose manuscript\r\noverflows the folds of their large post paper, and leaves no room for\r\nthe seal; but they were kind and affectionate, and seldom concluded\r\nwithout some allusion to our hero’s stud, some question about the state\r\nof his purse, and a special inquiry after such of his recruits as had\r\npreceded him from Waverley-Honour. Aunt Rachel charged him to remember\r\nhis principles of religion, to take care of his health, to beware of\r\nScotch mists, which, she had heard, would wet an Englishman through and\r\nthrough, never to go out at night without his great-coat, and, above\r\nall, to wear flannel next to his skin.\r\n\r\nMr. Pembroke only wrote to our hero one letter, but it was of the bulk\r\nof six epistles of these degenerate days, containing, in the moderate\r\ncompass of ten folio pages, closely written, a precis of a\r\nsupplementary quarto manuscript of _addenda, delenda, et corrigenda_ in\r\nreference to the two tracts with which he had presented Waverley. This\r\nhe considered as a mere sop in the pan to stay the appetite of Edward’s\r\ncuriosity until he should find an opportunity of sending down the\r\nvolume itself, which was much too heavy for the post, and which he\r\nproposed to accompany with certain interesting pamphlets, lately\r\npublished by his friend in Little Britain, with whom he had kept up a\r\nsort of literary correspondence, in virtue of which the library shelves\r\nof Waverley-Honour were loaded with much trash, and a good round bill,\r\nseldom summed in fewer than three figures, was yearly transmitted, in\r\nwhich Sir Everard Waverley of Waverley-Honour, Bart., was marked Dr. to\r\nJonathan Grubbet, bookseller and stationer, Little Britain. Such had\r\nhitherto been the style of the letters which Edward had received from\r\nEngland; but the packet delivered to him at Glennaquoich was of a\r\ndifferent and more interesting complexion. It would be impossible for\r\nthe reader, even were I to insert the letters at full length, to\r\ncomprehend the real cause of their being written, without a glance into\r\nthe interior of the British cabinet at the period in question.\r\n\r\nThe ministers of the day happened (no very singular event) to be\r\ndivided into two parties; the weakest of which, making up by assiduity\r\nof intrigue their inferiority in real consequence, had of late acquired\r\nsome new proselytes, and with them the hope of superseding their rivals\r\nin the favour of their sovereign, and overpowering them in the House of\r\nCommons. Amongst others, they had thought it worth while to practise\r\nupon Richard Waverley. This honest gentleman, by a grave mysterious\r\ndemeanour, an attention to the etiquette of business rather more than\r\nto its essence, a facility in making long dull speeches, consisting of\r\ntruisms and commonplaces, hashed up with a technical jargon of office,\r\nwhich prevented the inanity of his orations from being discovered, had\r\nacquired a certain name and credit in public life, and even\r\nestablished, with many, the character of a profound politician; none of\r\nyour shining orators, indeed, whose talents evaporate in tropes of\r\nrhetoric and flashes of wit, but one possessed of steady parts for\r\nbusiness, which would wear well, as the ladies say in choosing their\r\nsilks, and ought in all reason to be good for common and every-day use,\r\nsince they were confessedly formed of no holiday texture.\r\n\r\nThis faith had become so general that the insurgent party in the\r\ncabinet, of which we have made mention, after sounding Mr. Richard\r\nWaverley, were so satisfied with his sentiments and abilities as to\r\npropose that, in case of a certain revolution in the ministry, he\r\nshould take an ostensible place in the new order of things, not indeed\r\nof the very first rank, but greatly higher, in point both of emolument\r\nand influence, than that which he now enjoyed. There was no resisting\r\nso tempting a proposal, notwithstanding that the Great Man under whose\r\npatronage he had enlisted, and by whose banner he had hitherto stood\r\nfirm, was the principal object of the proposed attack by the new\r\nallies. Unfortunately this fair scheme of ambition was blighted in the\r\nvery bud by a premature movement. All the official gentlemen concerned\r\nin it who hesitated to take the part of a voluntary resignation were\r\ninformed that the king had no further occasion for their services; and\r\nin Richard Waverley’s case, which the minister considered as aggravated\r\nby ingratitude, dismissal was accompanied by something like personal\r\ncontempt and contumely. The public, and even the party of whom he\r\nshared the fall, sympathised little in the disappointment of this\r\nselfish and interested statesman; and he retired to the country under\r\nthe comfortable reflection that he had lost, at the same time,\r\ncharacter, credit, and,—what he at least equally deplored,—emolument.\r\n\r\nRichard Waverley’s letter to his son upon this occasion was a\r\nmasterpiece of its kind. Aristides himself could not have made out a\r\nharder case. An unjust monarch and an ungrateful country were the\r\nburden of each rounded paragraph. He spoke of long services and\r\nunrequited sacrifices; though the former had been overpaid by his\r\nsalary, and nobody could guess in what the latter consisted, unless it\r\nwere in his deserting, not from conviction, but for the lucre of gain,\r\nthe Tory principles of his family. In the conclusion, his resentment\r\nwas wrought to such an excess by the force of his own oratory, that he\r\ncould not repress some threats of vengeance, however vague and\r\nimpotent, and finally acquainted his son with his pleasure that he\r\nshould testify his sense of the ill-treatment he had sustained by\r\nthrowing up his commission as soon as the letter reached him. This, he\r\nsaid, was also his uncle’s desire, as he would himself intimate in due\r\ncourse.\r\n\r\nAccordingly, the next letter which Edward opened was from Sir Everard.\r\nHis brother’s disgrace seemed to have removed from his well-natured\r\nbosom all recollection of their differences, and, remote as he was from\r\nevery means of learning that Richard’s disgrace was in reality only the\r\njust as well as natural consequence of his own unsuccessful intrigues,\r\nthe good but credulous Baronet at once set it down as a new and\r\nenormous instance of the injustice of the existing government. It was\r\ntrue, he said, and he must not disguise it even from Edward, that his\r\nfather could not have sustained such an insult as was now, for the\r\nfirst time, offered to one of his house, unless he had subjected\r\nhimself to it by accepting of an employment under the present system.\r\nSir Everard had no doubt that he now both saw and felt the magnitude of\r\nthis error, and it should be his (Sir Everard’s) business to take care\r\nthat the cause of his regret should not extend itself to pecuniary\r\nconsequences. It was enough for a Waverley to have sustained the public\r\ndisgrace; the patrimonial injury could easily be obviated by the head\r\nof their family. But it was both the opinion of Mr. Richard Waverley\r\nand his own that Edward, the representative of the family of\r\nWaverley-Honour, should not remain in a situation which subjected him\r\nalso to such treatment as that with which his father had been\r\nstigmatised. He requested his nephew therefore to take the fittest, and\r\nat the same time the most speedy, opportunity of transmitting his\r\nresignation to the War Office, and hinted, moreover, that little\r\nceremony was necessary where so little had been used to his father. He\r\nsent multitudinous greetings to the Baron of Bradwardine.\r\n\r\nA letter from Aunt Rachel spoke out even more plainly. She considered\r\nthe disgrace of brother Richard as the just reward of his forfeiting\r\nhis allegiance to a lawful though exiled sovereign, and taking the\r\noaths to an alien; a concession which her grandfather, Sir Nigel\r\nWaverley, refused to make, either to the Roundhead Parliament or to\r\nCromwell, when his life and fortune stood in the utmost extremity. She\r\nhoped her dear Edward would follow the footsteps of his ancestors, and\r\nas speedily as possible get rid of the badge of servitude to the\r\nusurping family, and regard the wrongs sustained by his father as an\r\nadmonition from Heaven that every desertion of the line of loyalty\r\nbecomes its own punishment. She also concluded with her respects to Mr.\r\nBradwardine, and begged Waverley would inform her whether his daughter,\r\nMiss Rose, was old enough to wear a pair of very handsome ear-rings,\r\nwhich she proposed to send as a token of her affection. The good lady\r\nalso desired to be informed whether Mr. Bradwardine took as much Scotch\r\nsnuff and danced as unweariedly as he did when he was at\r\nWaverley-Honour about thirty years ago.\r\n\r\nThese letters, as might have been expected, highly excited Waverley’s\r\nindignation. From the desultory style of his studies, he had not any\r\nfixed political opinion to place in opposition to the movements of\r\nindignation which he felt at his father’s supposed wrongs. Of the real\r\ncause of his disgrace Edward was totally ignorant; nor had his habits\r\nat all led him to investigate the politics of the period in which he\r\nlived, or remark the intrigues in which his father had been so actively\r\nengaged. Indeed, any impressions which he had accidentally adopted\r\nconcerning the parties of the times were (owing to the society in which\r\nhe had lived at Waverley-Honour) of a nature rather unfavourable to the\r\nexisting government and dynasty. He entered, therefore, without\r\nhesitation into the resentful feeling of the relations who had the best\r\ntitle to dictate his conduct, and not perhaps the less willingly when\r\nhe remembered the tedium of his quarters, and the inferior figure which\r\nhe had made among the officers of his regiment. If he could have had\r\nany doubt upon the subject it would have been decided by the following\r\nletter from his commanding officer, which, as it is very short, shall\r\nbe inserted _verbatim._\r\n\r\nSIR,—Having carried somewhat beyond the line of my duty an indulgence\r\nwhich even the lights of nature, and much more those of Christianity,\r\ndirect towards errors which may arise from youth and inexperience, and\r\nthat altogether without effect, I am reluctantly compelled, at the\r\npresent crisis, to use the only remaining remedy which is in my power.\r\nYou are, therefore, hereby commanded to repair to—, the headquarters of\r\nthe regiment, within three days after the date of this letter. If you\r\nshall fail to do so, I must report you to the War Office as absent\r\nwithout leave, and also take other steps, which will be disagreeable to\r\nyou as well as to,\r\n\r\n\r\nSir,\r\nYour obedient Servant,\r\nJ. GARDINER,\r\n_Lieut.-Col. Commanding the——Regt. Dragoons._\r\n\r\n\r\nEdward’s blood boiled within him as he read this letter. He had been\r\naccustomed from his very infancy to possess in a great measure the\r\ndisposal of his own time, and thus acquired habits which rendered the\r\nrules of military discipline as unpleasing to him in this as they were\r\nin some other respects. An idea that in his own case they would not be\r\nenforced in a very rigid manner had also obtained full possession of\r\nhis mind, and had hitherto been sanctioned by the indulgent conduct of\r\nhis lieutenant-colonel. Neither had anything occurred, to his\r\nknowledge, that should have induced his commanding officer, without any\r\nother warning than the hints we noticed at the end of the fourteenth\r\nchapter, so suddenly to assume a harsh and, as Edward deemed it, so\r\ninsolent a tone of dictatorial authority. Connecting it with the\r\nletters he had just received from his family, he could not but suppose\r\nthat it was designed to make him feel, in his present situation, the\r\nsame pressure of authority which had been exercised in his father’s\r\ncase, and that the whole was a concerted scheme to depress and degrade\r\nevery member of the Waverley family.\r\n\r\nWithout a pause, therefore, Edward wrote a few cold lines, thanking his\r\nlieutenant-colonel for past civilities, and expressing regret that he\r\nshould have chosen to efface the remembrance of them by assuming a\r\ndifferent tone towards him. The strain of his letter, as well as what\r\nhe (Edward) conceived to be his duty in the present crisis, called upon\r\nhim to lay down his commission; and he therefore inclosed the formal\r\nresignation of a situation which subjected him to so unpleasant a\r\ncorrespondence, and requested Colonel Gardiner would have the goodness\r\nto forward it to the proper authorities.\r\n\r\nHaving finished this magnanimous epistle, he felt somewhat uncertain\r\nconcerning the terms in which his resignation ought to be expressed,\r\nupon which subject he resolved to consult Fergus Mac-Ivor. It may be\r\nobserved in passing that the bold and prompt habits of thinking,\r\nacting, and speaking which distinguished this young Chieftain had given\r\nhim a considerable ascendency over the mind of Waverley. Endowed with\r\nat least equal powers of understanding, and with much finer genius,\r\nEdward yet stooped to the bold and decisive activity of an intellect\r\nwhich was sharpened by the habit of acting on a preconceived and\r\nregular system, as well as by extensive knowledge of the world.\r\n\r\nWhen Edward found his friend, the latter had still in his hand the\r\nnewspaper which he had perused, and advanced to meet him with the\r\nembarrassment of one who has unpleasing news to communicate. “Do your\r\nletters, Captain Waverley, confirm the unpleasing information which I\r\nfind in this paper?”\r\n\r\nHe put the paper into his hand, where his father’s disgrace was\r\nregistered in the most bitter terms, transferred probably from some\r\nLondon journal. At the end of the paragraph was this remarkable\r\ninnuendo:—\r\n\r\n“We understand that “this same _Richard_ who hath done all this” is not\r\nthe only example of the _Wavering Honour_ of W-v-r-ly H-n-r. See the\r\nGazette of this day.”\r\n\r\n\r\nWith hurried and feverish apprehension our hero turned to the place\r\nreferred to, and found therein recorded, “Edward Waverley, captain\r\nin——regiment dragoons, superseded for absence without leave”; and in\r\nthe list of military promotions, referring to the same regiment, he\r\ndiscovered this farther article, “Lieut. Julius Butler, to be captain,\r\n_vice_ Edward Waverley, superseded.”\r\n\r\nOur hero’s bosom glowed with the resentment which undeserved and\r\napparently premeditated insult was calculated to excite in the bosom of\r\none who had aspired after honour, and was thus wantonly held up to\r\npublic scorn and disgrace. Upon comparing the date of his colonel’s\r\nletter with that of the article in the Gazette, he perceived that his\r\nthreat of making a report upon his absence had been literally\r\nfulfilled, and without inquiry, as it seemed, whether Edward had either\r\nreceived his summons or was disposed to comply with it. The whole,\r\ntherefore, appeared a formed plan to degrade him in the eyes of the\r\npublic; and the idea of its having succeeded filled him with such\r\nbitter emotions that, after various attempts to conceal them, he at\r\nlength threw himself into Mac-Ivor’s arms, and gave vent to tears of\r\nshame and indignation.\r\n\r\nIt was none of this Chieftain’s faults to be indifferent to the wrongs\r\nof his friends; and for Edward, independent of certain plans with which\r\nhe was connected, he felt a deep and sincere interest. The proceeding\r\nappeared as extraordinary to him as it had done to Edward. He indeed\r\nknew of more motives than Waverley was privy to for the peremptory\r\norder that he should join his regiment. But that, without further\r\ninquiry into the circumstances of a necessary delay, the commanding\r\nofficer, in contradiction to his known and established character,\r\nshould have proceeded in so harsh and unusual a manner was a mystery\r\nwhich he could not penetrate. He soothed our hero, however, to the best\r\nof his power, and began to turn his thoughts on revenge for his\r\ninsulted honour.\r\n\r\nEdward eagerly grasped at the idea. “Will you carry a message for me to\r\nColonel Gardiner, my dear Fergus, and oblige me for ever?”\r\n\r\nFergus paused. “It is an act of friendship which you should command,\r\ncould it be useful, or lead to the righting your honour; but in the\r\npresent case I doubt if your commanding officer would give you the\r\nmeeting on account of his having taken measures which, however harsh\r\nand exasperating, were still within the strict bounds of his duty.\r\nBesides, Gardiner is a precise Huguenot, and has adopted certain ideas\r\nabout the sinfulness of such _rencontres_, from which it would be\r\nimpossible to make him depart, especially as his courage is beyond all\r\nsuspicion. And besides, I—I, to say the truth—I dare not at this\r\nmoment, for some very weighty reasons, go near any of the military\r\nquarters or garrisons belonging to this government.”\r\n\r\n“And am I,” said Waverley, “to sit down quiet and contented under the\r\ninjury I have received?”\r\n\r\n“That will I never advise my friend,” replied Mac-Ivor. “But I would\r\nhave vengeance to fall on the head, not on the hand, on the tyrannical\r\nand oppressive government which designed and directed these\r\npremeditated and reiterated insults, not on the tools of office which\r\nthey employed in the execution of the injuries they aimed at you.”\r\n\r\n“On the government!” said Waverley.\r\n\r\n“Yes,” replied the impetuous Highlander, “on the usurping House of\r\nHanover, whom your grandfather would no more have served than he would\r\nhave taken wages of red-hot gold from the great fiend of hell!”\r\n\r\n“But since the time of my grandfather two generations of this dynasty\r\nhave possessed the throne,” said Edward coolly.\r\n\r\n“True,” replied the Chieftain; “and because we have passively given\r\nthem so long the means of showing their native character,—because both\r\nyou and I myself have lived in quiet submission, have even truckled to\r\nthe times so far as to accept commissions under them, and thus have\r\ngiven them an opportunity of disgracing us publicly by resuming them,\r\nare we not on that account to resent injuries which our fathers only\r\napprehended, but which we have actually sustained? Or is the cause of\r\nthe unfortunate Stuart family become less just, because their title has\r\ndevolved upon an heir who is innocent of the charges of misgovernment\r\nbrought against his father? Do you remember the lines of your favourite\r\npoet,—\r\n\r\nHad Richard unconstrain’d resign’d the throne,\r\nA king can give no more than is his own;\r\nThe title stood entail’d had Richard had a son.\r\n\r\n\r\nYou see, my dear Waverley, I can quote poetry as well as Flora and you.\r\nBut come, clear your moody brow, and trust to me to show you an\r\nhonourable road to a speedy and glorious revenge. Let us seek Flora,\r\nwho perhaps has more news to tell us of what has occurred during our\r\nabsence. She will rejoice to hear that you are relieved of your\r\nservitude. But first add a postscript to your letter, marking the time\r\nwhen you received this calvinistical colonel’s first summons, and\r\nexpress your regret that the hastiness of his proceedings prevented\r\nyour anticipating them by sending your resignation. Then let him blush\r\nfor his injustice.”\r\n\r\nThe letter was sealed accordingly, covering a formal resignation of the\r\ncommission, and Mac-Ivor despatched it with some letters of his own by\r\na special messenger, with charge to put them into the nearest\r\npost-office in the Lowlands.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXVI.\r\nAN ECLAIRCISSEMENT\r\n\r\n\r\nThe hint which the Chieftain had thrown out respecting Flora was not\r\nunpremeditated. He had observed with great satisfaction the growing\r\nattachment of Waverley to his sister, nor did he see any bar to their\r\nunion, excepting the situation which Waverley’s father held in the\r\nministry, and Edward’s own commission in the army of George II. These\r\nobstacles were now removed, and in a manner which apparently paved the\r\nway for the son’s becoming reconciled to another allegiance. In every\r\nother respect the match would be most eligible. The safety, happiness,\r\nand honourable provision of his sister, whom he dearly loved, appeared\r\nto be ensured by the proposed union; and his heart swelled when he\r\nconsidered how his own interest would be exalted in the eyes of the\r\nex-monarch to whom he had dedicated his service, by an alliance with\r\none of those ancient, powerful, and wealthy English families of the\r\nsteady cavalier faith, to awaken whose decayed attachment to the Stuart\r\nfamily was now a matter of such vital importance to the Stuart cause.\r\nNor could Fergus perceive any obstacle to such a scheme. Waverley’s\r\nattachment was evident; and as his person was handsome, and his taste\r\napparently coincided with her own, he anticipated no opposition on the\r\npart of Flora. Indeed, between his ideas of patriarchal power and those\r\nwhich he had acquired in France respecting the disposal of females in\r\nmarriage, any opposition from his sister, dear as she was to him, would\r\nhave been the last obstacle on which he would have calculated, even had\r\nthe union been less eligible.\r\n\r\nInfluenced by these feelings, the Chief now led Waverley in quest of\r\nMiss Mac-Ivor, not without the hope that the present agitation of his\r\nguest’s spirits might give him courage to cut short what Fergus termed\r\nthe romance of the courtship. They found Flora, with her faithful\r\nattendants, Una and Cathleen, busied in preparing what appeared to\r\nWaverley to be white bridal favours. Disguising as well as he could the\r\nagitation of his mind, Waverley asked for what joyful occasion Miss\r\nMac-Ivor made such ample preparation.\r\n\r\n“It is for Fergus’s bridal,” she said, smiling.\r\n\r\n“Indeed!” said Edward; “he has kept his secret well. I hope he will\r\nallow me to be his bride’s-man.”\r\n\r\n“That is a man’s office, but not yours, as Beatrice says,” retorted\r\nFlora.\r\n\r\n“And who is the fair lady, may I be permitted to ask, Miss Mac-Ivor?”\r\n\r\n“Did not I tell you long since that Fergus wooed no bride but Honour?”\r\nanswered Flora.\r\n\r\n“And am I then incapable of being his assistant and counsellor in the\r\npursuit of honour?” said our hero, colouring deeply. “Do I rank so low\r\nin your opinion?”\r\n\r\n“Far from it, Captain Waverley. I would to God you were of our\r\ndetermination! and made use of the expression which displeased you,\r\nsolely\r\n\r\nBecause you are not of our quality,\r\nBut stand against us as an enemy.”\r\n\r\n\r\n“That time is past, sister,” said Fergus; “and you may wish Edward\r\nWaverley (no longer captain) joy of being freed from the slavery to an\r\nusurper, implied in that sable and ill-omened emblem.”\r\n\r\n“Yes,” said Waverley, undoing the cockade from his hat, “it has pleased\r\nthe king who bestowed this badge upon me to resume it in a manner which\r\nleaves me little reason to regret his service.”\r\n\r\n“Thank God for that!” cried the enthusiast; “and O that they may be\r\nblind enough to treat every man of honour who serves them with the same\r\nindignity, that I may have less to sigh for when the struggle\r\napproaches!”\r\n\r\n“And now, sister,” said the Chieftain, “replace his cockade with one of\r\na more lively colour. I think it was the fashion of the ladies of yore\r\nto arm and send forth their knights to high achievement.”\r\n\r\n“Not,” replied the lady, “till the knight adventurer had well weighed\r\nthe justice and the danger of the cause, Fergus. Mr. Waverley is just\r\nnow too much agitated by feelings of recent emotion for me to press\r\nupon him a resolution of consequence.”\r\n\r\nWaverley felt half alarmed at the thought of adopting the badge of what\r\nwas by the majority of the kingdom esteemed rebellion, yet he could not\r\ndisguise his chagrin at the coldness with which Flora parried her\r\nbrother’s hint. “Miss Mac-Ivor, I perceive, thinks the knight unworthy\r\nof her encouragement and favour,” said he, somewhat bitterly.\r\n\r\n“Not so, Mr. Waverley,” she replied, with great sweetness. “Why should\r\nI refuse my brother’s valued friend a boon which I am distributing to\r\nhis whole clan? Most willingly would I enlist every man of honour in\r\nthe cause to which my brother has devoted himself. But Fergus has taken\r\nhis measures with his eyes open. His life has been devoted to this\r\ncause from his cradle; with him its call is sacred, were it even a\r\nsummons to the tomb. But how can I wish you, Mr. Waverley, so new to\r\nthe world, so far from every friend who might advise and ought to\r\ninfluence you,—in a moment, too, of sudden pique and indignation,—how\r\ncan I wish you to plunge yourself at once into so desperate an\r\nenterprise?”\r\n\r\nFergus, who did not understand these delicacies, strode through the\r\napartment biting his lip, and then, with a constrained smile, said,\r\n“Well, sister, I leave you to act your new character of mediator\r\nbetween the Elector of Hanover and the subjects of your lawful\r\nsovereign and benefactor,” and left the room.\r\n\r\nThere was a painful pause, which was at length broken by Miss Mac-Ivor.\r\n“My brother is unjust,” she said, “because he can bear no interruption\r\nthat seems to thwart his loyal zeal.”\r\n\r\n“And do you not share his ardour?” asked Waverley,\r\n\r\n“Do I not?” answered Flora. “God knows mine exceeds his, if that be\r\npossible. But I am not, like him, rapt by the bustle of military\r\npreparation, and the infinite detail necessary to the present\r\nundertaking, beyond consideration of the grand principles of justice\r\nand truth, on which our enterprise is grounded; and these, I am\r\ncertain, can only be furthered by measures in themselves true and just.\r\nTo operate upon your present feelings, my dear Mr. Waverley, to induce\r\nyou to an irretrievable step, of which you have not considered either\r\nthe justice or the danger, is, in my poor judgment, neither the one nor\r\nthe other.”\r\n\r\n“Incomparable Flora!” said Edward, taking her hand, “how much do I need\r\nsuch a monitor!”\r\n\r\n“A better one by far,” said Flora, gently withdrawing her hand, “Mr.\r\nWaverley will always find in his own bosom, when he will give its small\r\nstill voice leisure to be heard.”\r\n\r\n“No, Miss Mac-Ivor, I dare not hope it; a thousand circumstances of\r\nfatal self-indulgence have made me the creature rather of imagination\r\nthan reason. Durst I but hope—could I but think—that you would deign to\r\nbe to me that affectionate, that condescending friend, who would\r\nstrengthen me to redeem my errors, my future life—”\r\n\r\n“Hush, my dear sir! now you carry your joy at escaping the hands of a\r\nJacobite recruiting officer to an unparalleled excess of gratitude.”\r\n\r\n“Nay, dear Flora, trifle with me no longer; you cannot mistake the\r\nmeaning of those feelings which I have almost involuntarily expressed;\r\nand since I have broken the barrier of silence, let me profit by my\r\naudacity. Or may I, with your permission, mention to your brother—”\r\n\r\n“Not for the world, Mr. Waverley!”\r\n\r\n“What am I to understand?” said Edward. “Is there any fatal bar—has any\r\nprepossession—”\r\n\r\n“None, sir,” answered Flora. “I owe it to myself to say that I never\r\nyet saw the person on whom I thought with reference to the present\r\nsubject.”\r\n\r\n“The shortness of our acquaintance, perhaps—If Miss Mac-Ivor will deign\r\nto give me time—”\r\n\r\n“I have not even that excuse. Captain Waverley’s character is so\r\nopen—is, in short, of that nature that it cannot be misconstrued,\r\neither in its strength or its weakness.”\r\n\r\n“And for that weakness you despise me?” said Edward.\r\n\r\n“Forgive me, Mr. Waverley—and remember it is but within this half hour\r\nthat there existed between us a barrier of a nature to me\r\ninsurmountable, since I never could think of an officer in the service\r\nof the Elector of Hanover in any other light than as a casual\r\nacquaintance. Permit me then to arrange my ideas upon so unexpected a\r\ntopic, and in less than an hour I will be ready to give you such\r\nreasons for the resolution I shall express as may be satisfactory at\r\nleast, if not pleasing to you.” So saying Flora withdrew, leaving\r\nWaverley to meditate upon the manner in which she had received his\r\naddresses.\r\n\r\nEre he could make up his mind whether to believe his suit had been\r\nacceptable or no, Fergus re-entered the apartment. “What, _à la mort_,\r\nWaverley?” he cried. “Come down with me to the court, and you shall see\r\na sight worth all the tirades of your romances. An hundred firelocks,\r\nmy friend, and as many broadswords, just arrived from good friends; and\r\ntwo or three hundred stout fellows almost fighting which shall first\r\npossess them. But let me look at you closer. Why, a true Highlander\r\nwould say you had been blighted by an evil eye. Or can it be this silly\r\ngirl that has thus blanked your spirit. Never mind her, dear Edward;\r\nthe wisest of her sex are fools in what regards the business of life.”\r\n\r\n“Indeed, my good friend,” answered Waverley, “all that I can charge\r\nagainst your sister is, that she is too sensible, too reasonable.”\r\n\r\n“If that be all, I ensure you for a louis-d’or against the mood lasting\r\nfour-and-twenty hours. No woman was ever steadily sensible for that\r\nperiod; and I will engage, if that will please you, Flora shall be as\r\nunreasonable to-morrow as any of her sex. You must learn, my dear\r\nEdward, to consider women _en mousquetaire_.” So saying, he seized\r\nWaverley’s arm and dragged him off to review his military preparations.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXVII.\r\nUPON THE SAME SUBJECT\r\n\r\n\r\nFergus Mac-Ivor had too much tact and delicacy to renew the subject\r\nwhich he had interrupted. His head was, or appeared to be, so full of\r\nguns, broadswords, bonnets, canteens, and tartan hose that Waverley\r\ncould not for some time draw his attention to any other topic.\r\n\r\n“Are you to take the field so soon, Fergus,” he asked, “that you are\r\nmaking all these martial preparations?”\r\n\r\n“When we have settled that you go with me, you shall know all; but\r\notherwise, the knowledge might rather be prejudicial to you.”\r\n\r\n“But are you serious in your purpose, with such inferior forces, to\r\nrise against an established government? It is mere frenzy.”\r\n\r\n“_Laissez faire à Don Antoine_,—I shall take good care of myself. We\r\nshall at least use the compliment of Conan, who never got a stroke but\r\nhe gave one. I would not, however,” continued the Chieftain, “have you\r\nthink me mad enough to stir till a favourable opportunity: I will not\r\nslip my dog before the game’s afoot. But, once more, will you join with\r\nus, and you shall know all?”\r\n\r\n“How can I?” said Waverley; “I, who have so lately held that commission\r\nwhich is now posting back to those that gave it? My accepting it\r\nimplied a promise of fidelity, and an acknowledgment of the legality of\r\nthe government.”\r\n\r\n“A rash promise,” answered Fergus, “is not a steel handcuff, it may be\r\nshaken off, especially when it was given under deception, and has been\r\nrepaid by insult. But if you cannot immediately make up your mind to a\r\nglorious revenge, go to England, and ere you cross the Tweed you will\r\nhear tidings that will make the world ring; and if Sir Everard be the\r\ngallant old cavalier I have heard him described by some of our _honest_\r\ngentlemen of the year one thousand seven hundred and fifteen, he will\r\nfind you a better horse-troop and a better cause than you have lost.”\r\n\r\n“But your sister, Fergus?”\r\n\r\n“Out, hyperbolical fiend!” replied the Chief, laughing; “how vexest\r\nthou this man! Speak’st thou of nothing but of ladies?”\r\n\r\n“Nay, be serious, my dear friend,” said Waverley; “I feel that the\r\nhappiness of my future life must depend upon the answer which Miss\r\nMac-Ivor shall make to what I ventured to tell her this morning.”\r\n\r\n“And is this your very sober earnest,” said Fergus, more gravely, “or\r\nare we in the land of romance and fiction?”\r\n\r\n“My earnest, undoubtedly. How could you suppose me jesting on such a\r\nsubject?”\r\n\r\n“Then, in very sober earnest,” answered his friend, “I am very glad to\r\nhear it; and so highly do I think of Flora, that you are the only man\r\nin England for whom I would say so much. But before you shake my hand\r\nso warmly, there is more to be considered. Your own family—will they\r\napprove your connecting yourself with the sister of a high-born\r\nHighland beggar?”\r\n\r\n“My uncle’s situation,” said Waverley, “his general opinions, and his\r\nuniform indulgence, entitle me to say, that birth and personal\r\nqualities are all he would look to in such a connection. And where can\r\nI find both united in such excellence as in your sister?”\r\n\r\n“Oh, nowhere! _cela va sans dire_,” replied Fergus, with a smile. “But\r\nyour father will expect a father’s prerogative in being consulted.”\r\n\r\n“Surely; but his late breach with the ruling powers removes all\r\napprehension of objection on his part, especially as I am convinced\r\nthat my uncle will be warm in my cause.”\r\n\r\n“Religion perhaps,” said Fergus, “may make obstacles, though we are not\r\nbigotted Catholics.”\r\n\r\n“My grandmother was of the Church of Rome, and her religion was never\r\nobjected to by my family. Do not think of _my_ friends, dear Fergus;\r\nlet me rather have your influence where it may be more necessary to\r\nremove obstacles—I mean with your lovely sister.”\r\n\r\n“My lovely sister,” replied Fergus, “like her loving brother, is very\r\napt to have a pretty decisive will of her own, by which, in this case,\r\nyou must be ruled; but you shall not want my interest, nor my counsel.\r\nAnd, in the first place, I will give you one hint—Loyalty is her ruling\r\npassion; and since she could spell an English book she has been in love\r\nwith the memory of the gallant Captain Wogan, who renounced the service\r\nof the usurper Cromwell to join the standard of Charles II, marched a\r\nhandful of cavalry from London to the Highlands to join Middleton, then\r\nin arms for the king, and at length died gloriously in the royal cause.\r\nAsk her to show you some verses she made on his history and fate; they\r\nhave been much admired, I assure you. The next point is—I think I saw\r\nFlora go up towards the waterfall a short time since; follow, man,\r\nfollow! don’t allow the garrison time to strengthen its purposes of\r\nresistance. _Alerte à la muraille!_ Seek Flora out, and learn her\r\ndecision as soon as you can, and Cupid go with you, while I go to look\r\nover belts and cartouch-boxes.”\r\n\r\nWaverley ascended the glen with an anxious and throbbing heart. Love,\r\nwith all its romantic train of hopes, fears, and wishes, was mingled\r\nwith other feelings of a nature less easily defined. He could not but\r\nremember how much this morning had changed his fate, and into what a\r\ncomplication of perplexity it was likely to plunge him. Sunrise had\r\nseen him possessed of an esteemed rank in the honourable profession of\r\narms, his father to all appearance rapidly rising in the favour of his\r\nsovereign. All this had passed away like a dream: he himself was\r\ndishonoured, his father disgraced, and he had become involuntarily the\r\nconfidant at least, if not the accomplice, of plans, dark, deep, and\r\ndangerous, which must infer either the subversion of the government he\r\nhad so lately served or the destruction of all who had participated in\r\nthem. Should Flora even listen to his suit favourably, what prospect\r\nwas there of its being brought to a happy termination amid the tumult\r\nof an impending insurrection? Or how could he make the selfish request\r\nthat she should leave Fergus, to whom she was so much attached, and,\r\nretiring with him to England, wait, as a distant spectator, the success\r\nof her brother’s undertaking, or the ruin of all his hopes and\r\nfortunes? Or, on the other hand, to engage himself, with no other aid\r\nthan his single arm, in the dangerous and precipitate counsels of the\r\nChieftain, to be whirled along by him, the partaker of all his\r\ndesperate and impetuous motions, renouncing almost the power of\r\njudging, or deciding upon the rectitude or prudence of his actions,\r\nthis was no pleasing prospect for the secret pride of Waverley to stoop\r\nto. And yet what other conclusion remained, saving the rejection of his\r\naddresses by Flora, an alternative not to be thought of in the present\r\nhigh-wrought state of his feelings with anything short of mental agony.\r\nPondering the doubtful and dangerous prospect before him, he at length\r\narrived near the cascade, where, as Fergus had augured, he found Flora\r\nseated.\r\n\r\nShe was quite alone, and as soon as she observed his approach she rose\r\nand came to meet him. Edward attempted to say something within the\r\nverge of ordinary compliment and conversation, but found himself\r\nunequal to the task. Flora seemed at first equally embarrassed, but\r\nrecovered herself more speedily, and (an unfavourable augury for\r\nWaverley’s suit) was the first to enter upon the subject of their last\r\ninterview. “It is too important, in every point of view, Mr. Waverley,\r\nto permit me to leave you in doubt on my sentiments.”\r\n\r\n“Do not speak them speedily,” said Waverley, much agitated, “unless\r\nthey are such as I fear, from your manner, I must not dare to\r\nanticipate. Let time—let my future conduct—let your brother’s\r\ninfluence—”\r\n\r\n“Forgive me, Mr. Waverley,” said Flora, her complexion a little\r\nheightened, but her voice firm and composed. “I should incur my own\r\nheavy censure did I delay expressing my sincere conviction that I can\r\nnever regard you otherwise than as a valued friend. I should do you the\r\nhighest injustice did I conceal my sentiments for a moment. I see I\r\ndistress you, and I grieve for it, but better now than later; and O,\r\nbetter a thousand times, Mr. Waverley, that you should feel a present\r\nmomentary disappointment than the long and heart-sickening griefs which\r\nattend a rash and ill-assorted marriage!”\r\n\r\n“Good God!” exclaimed Waverley, “why should you anticipate such\r\nconsequences from a union where birth is equal, where fortune is\r\nfavourable, where, if I may venture to say so, the tastes are similar,\r\nwhere you allege no preference for another, where you even express a\r\nfavourable opinion of him whom you reject?”\r\n\r\n“Mr. Waverley, I _have_ that favourable opinion,” answered Flora; “and\r\nso strongly that, though I would rather have been silent on the grounds\r\nof my resolution, you shall command them, if you exact such a mark of\r\nmy esteem and confidence.”\r\n\r\nShe sat down upon a fragment of rock, and Waverley, placing himself\r\nnear her, anxiously pressed for the explanation she offered.\r\n\r\n“I dare hardly,” she said, “tell you the situation of my feelings, they\r\nare so different from those usually ascribed to young women at my\r\nperiod of life; and I dare hardly touch upon what I conjecture to be\r\nthe nature of yours, lest I should give offence where I would willingly\r\nadminister consolation. For myself, from my infancy till this day I\r\nhave had but one wish—the restoration of my royal benefactors to their\r\nrightful throne. It is impossible to express to you the devotion of my\r\nfeelings to this single subject; and I will frankly confess that it has\r\nso occupied my mind as to exclude every thought respecting what is\r\ncalled my own settlement in life. Let me but live to see the day of\r\nthat happy restoration, and a Highland cottage, a French convent, or an\r\nEnglish palace will be alike indifferent to me.”\r\n\r\n“But, dearest Flora, how is your enthusiastic zeal for the exiled\r\nfamily inconsistent with my happiness?”\r\n\r\n“Because you seek, or ought to seek, in the object of your attachment a\r\nheart whose principal delight should be in augmenting your domestic\r\nfelicity and returning your affection, even to the height of romance.\r\nTo a man of less keen sensibility, and less enthusiastic tenderness of\r\ndisposition, Flora Mac-Ivor might give content, if not happiness; for,\r\nwere the irrevocable words spoken, never would she be deficient in the\r\nduties which she vowed.”\r\n\r\n“And why,—why, Miss Mac-Ivor, should you think yourself a more valuable\r\ntreasure to one who is less capable of loving, of admiring you, than to\r\nme?”\r\n\r\n“Simply because the tone of our affections would be more in unison, and\r\nbecause his more blunted sensibility would not require the return of\r\nenthusiasm which I have not to bestow. But you, Mr. Waverley, would for\r\never refer to the idea of domestic happiness which your imagination is\r\ncapable of painting, and whatever fell short of that ideal\r\nrepresentation would be construed into coolness and indifference, while\r\nyou might consider the enthusiasm with which I regarded the success of\r\nthe royal family as defrauding your affection of its due return.”\r\n\r\n“In other words, Miss Mac-Ivor, you cannot love me?” said her suitor\r\ndejectedly.\r\n\r\n“I could esteem you, Mr. Waverley, as much, perhaps more, than any man\r\nI have ever seen; but I cannot love you as you ought to be loved. O! do\r\nnot, for your own sake, desire so hazardous an experiment! The woman\r\nwhom you marry ought to have affections and opinions moulded upon\r\nyours. Her studies ought to be your studies; her wishes, her feelings,\r\nher hopes, her fears, should all mingle with yours. She should enhance\r\nyour pleasures, share your sorrows, and cheer your melancholy.”\r\n\r\n“And why will not you, Miss Mac-Ivor, who can so well describe a happy\r\nunion, why will not you be yourself the person you describe?”\r\n\r\n“Is it possible you do not yet comprehend me?” answered Flora. “Have I\r\nnot told you that every keener sensation of my mind is bent exclusively\r\ntowards an event upon which, indeed, I have no power but those of my\r\nearnest prayers?”\r\n\r\n“And might not the granting the suit I solicit,” said Waverley, too\r\nearnest on his purpose to consider what he was about to say, “even\r\nadvance the interest to which you have devoted yourself? My family is\r\nwealthy and powerful, inclined in principles to the Stuart race, and\r\nshould a favourable opportunity—”\r\n\r\n“A favourable opportunity!” said Flora—somewhat scornfully. “Inclined\r\nin principles! Can such lukewarm adherence be honourable to yourselves,\r\nor gratifying to your lawful sovereign? Think, from my present\r\nfeelings, what I should suffer when I held the place of member in a\r\nfamily where the rights which I hold most sacred are subjected to cold\r\ndiscussion, and only deemed worthy of support when they shall appear on\r\nthe point of triumphing without it!”\r\n\r\n“Your doubts,” quickly replied Waverley, “are unjust as far as concerns\r\nmyself. The cause that I shall assert, I dare support through every\r\ndanger, as undauntedly as the boldest who draws sword in its behalf.”\r\n\r\n“Of that,” answered Flora, “I cannot doubt for a moment. But consult\r\nyour own good sense and reason rather than a prepossession hastily\r\nadopted, probably only because you have met a young woman possessed of\r\nthe usual accomplishments in a sequestered and romantic situation. Let\r\nyour part in this great and perilous drama rest upon conviction, and\r\nnot on a hurried and probably a temporary feeling.”\r\n\r\nWaverley attempted to reply, but his words failed him. Every sentiment\r\nthat Flora had uttered vindicated the strength of his attachment; for\r\neven her loyalty, although wildly enthusiastic, was generous and noble,\r\nand disdained to avail itself of any indirect means of supporting the\r\ncause to which she was devoted.\r\n\r\nAfter walking a little way in silence down the path, Flora thus resumed\r\nthe conversation.—“One word more, Mr. Waverley, ere we bid farewell to\r\nthis topic for ever; and forgive my boldness if that word have the air\r\nof advice. My brother Fergus is anxious that you should join him in his\r\npresent enterprise. But do not consent to this; you could not, by your\r\nsingle exertions, further his success, and you would inevitably share\r\nhis fall, if it be God’s pleasure that fall he must. Your character\r\nwould also suffer irretrievably. Let me beg you will return to your own\r\ncountry; and, having publicly freed yourself from every tie to the\r\nusurping government, I trust you will see cause, and find opportunity,\r\nto serve your injured sovereign with effect, and stand forth, as your\r\nloyal ancestors, at the head of your natural followers and adherents, a\r\nworthy representative of the house of Waverley.”\r\n\r\n“And should I be so happy as thus to distinguish myself, might I not\r\nhope—”\r\n\r\n“Forgive my interruption,” said Flora. “The present time only is ours,\r\nand I can but explain to you with candour the feelings which I now\r\nentertain; how they might be altered by a train of events too\r\nfavourable perhaps to be hoped for, it were in vain even to conjecture.\r\nOnly be assured, Mr. Waverley, that, after my brother’s honour and\r\nhappiness, there is none which I shall more sincerely pray for than for\r\nyours.”\r\n\r\nWith these words she parted from him, for they were now arrived where\r\ntwo paths separated. Waverley reached the castle amidst a medley of\r\nconflicting passions. He avoided any private interview with Fergus, as\r\nhe did not find himself able either to encounter his raillery or reply\r\nto his solicitations. The wild revelry of the feast, for Mac-Ivor kept\r\nopen table for his clan, served in some degree to stun reflection. When\r\ntheir festivity was ended, he began to consider how he should again\r\nmeet Miss Mac-Ivor after the painful and interesting explanation of the\r\nmorning. But Flora did not appear. Fergus, whose eyes flashed when he\r\nwas told by Cathleen that her mistress designed to keep her apartment\r\nthat evening, went himself in quest of her; but apparently his\r\nremonstrances were in vain, for he returned with a heightened\r\ncomplexion and manifest symptoms of displeasure. The rest of the\r\nevening passed on without any allusion, on the part either of Fergus or\r\nWaverley, to the subject which engrossed the reflections of the latter,\r\nand perhaps of both.\r\n\r\nWhen retired to his own apartment, Edward endeavoured to sum up the\r\nbusiness of the day. That the repulse he had received from Flora would\r\nbe persisted in for the present, there was no doubt. But could he hope\r\nfor ultimate success in case circumstances permitted the renewal of his\r\nsuit? Would the enthusiastic loyalty, which at this animating moment\r\nleft no room for a softer passion, survive, at least in its engrossing\r\nforce, the success or the failure of the present political\r\nmachinations? And if so, could he hope that the interest which she had\r\nacknowledged him to possess in her favour might be improved into a\r\nwarmer attachment? He taxed his memory to recall every word she had\r\nused, with the appropriate looks and gestures which had enforced them,\r\nand ended by finding himself in the same state of uncertainty. It was\r\nvery late before sleep brought relief to the tumult of his mind, after\r\nthe most painful and agitating day which he had ever passed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXVIII.\r\nA LETTER FROM TULLY-VEOLAN\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the morning, when Waverley’s troubled reflections had for some time\r\ngiven way to repose, there came music to his dreams, but not the voice\r\nof Selma. He imagined himself transported back to Tully-Veolan, and\r\nthat he heard Davie Gellatley singing in the court those matins which\r\nused generally to be the first sounds that disturbed his repose while a\r\nguest of the Baron of Bradwardine. The notes which suggested this\r\nvision continued, and waxed louder, until Edward awoke in earnest. The\r\nillusion, however, did not seem entirely dispelled. The apartment was\r\nin the fortress of Ian nan Chaistel, but it was still the voice of\r\nDavie Gellatley that made the following lines resound under the\r\nwindow:—\r\n\r\nMy heart’s in the Highlands, my heart is not here,\r\nMy heart’s in the Highlands a-chasing the deer;\r\nA-chasing the wild deer, and following the roe,\r\nMy heart’s in the Highlands wherever I go.[*]\r\n\r\n\r\n[* These lines form the burden of an old song to which Burns wrote\r\nadditional verses.]\r\n\r\n\r\nCurious to know what could have determined Mr. Gellatley on an\r\nexcursion of such unwonted extent, Edward began to dress himself in all\r\nhaste, during which operation the minstrelsy of Davie changed its tune\r\nmore than once:—\r\n\r\nThere’s nought in the Highlands but syboes and leeks,\r\nAnd lang-leggit callants gaun wanting the breeks,\r\nWanting the breeks, and without hose and shoon,\r\nBut we’ll a’win the breeks when King Jamie comes hame.[*]\r\n\r\n\r\n[* These lines are also ancient, and I believe to the tune of “We’ll\r\nnever hae peace till Jamie comes hame,” to which Burns likewise wrote\r\nsome verses.]\r\n\r\n\r\nBy the time Waverley was dressed and had issued forth, David had\r\nassociated himself with two or three of the numerous Highland loungers\r\nwho always graced the gates of the castle with their presence, and was\r\ncapering and dancing full merrily in the doubles and full career of a\r\nScotch foursome reel, to the music of his own whistling. In this double\r\ncapacity of dancer and musician he continued, until an idle piper, who\r\nobserved his zeal, obeyed the unanimous call of“seid suas” (that is\r\nblow up), and relieved him from the latter part of his trouble. Young\r\nand old then mingled in the dance as they could find partners. The\r\nappearance of Waverley did not interrupt David’s exercise, though he\r\ncontrived, by grinning, nodding, and throwing one or two inclinations\r\nof the body into the graces with which he performed the Highland fling,\r\nto convey to our hero symptoms of recognition. Then, while busily\r\nemployed in setting, whooping all the while, and snapping his fingers\r\nover his head, he of a sudden prolonged his side-step until it brought\r\nhim to the place where Edward was standing, and, still keeping time to\r\nthe music like Harlequin in a pantomime, he thrust a letter into our\r\nhero’s hand, and continued his saltation without pause or intermission.\r\nEdward, who perceived that the address was in Rose’s hand-writing,\r\nretired to peruse it, leaving the faithful bearer to continue his\r\nexercise until the piper or he should be tired out.\r\n\r\nThe contents of the letter greatly surprised him. It had originally\r\ncommenced with “Dear Sir”; but these words had been carefully erased,\r\nand the monosyllable “Sir” substituted in their place. The rest of the\r\ncontents shall be given in Rose’s own language.\r\n\r\nI fear I am using an improper freedom by intruding upon you, yet I\r\ncannot trust to any one else to let you know some things which have\r\nhappened here, with which it seems necessary you should be acquainted.\r\nForgive me, if I am wrong in what I am doing; for, alas! Mr. Waverley,\r\nI have no better advice than that of my own feelings; my dear father is\r\ngone from this place, and when he can return to my assistance and\r\nprotection, God alone knows. You have probably heard that, in\r\nconsequence of some troublesome news from the Highlands, warrants were\r\nsent out for apprehending several gentlemen in these parts, and, among\r\nothers, my dear father. In spite of all my tears and entreaties that he\r\nwould surrender himself to the government, he joined with Mr. Falconer\r\nand some other gentlemen, and they have all gone northwards, with a\r\nbody of about forty horsemen. So I am not so anxious concerning his\r\nimmediate safety as about what may follow afterwards, for these\r\ntroubles are only beginning. But all this is nothing to you, Mr.\r\nWaverley, only I thought you would be glad to learn that my father has\r\nescaped, in case you happen to have heard that he was in danger.\r\n    The day after my father went off there came a party of soldiers to\r\n    Tully-Veolan, and behaved very rudely to Bailie Macwheeble; but the\r\n    officer was very civil to me, only said his duty obliged him to\r\n    search for arms and papers. My father had provided against this by\r\n    taking away all the arms except the old useless things which hung\r\n    in the hall, and he had put all his papers out of the way. But O!\r\n    Mr. Waverley, how shall I tell you, that they made strict inquiry\r\n    after you, and asked when you had been at Tully-Veolan, and where\r\n    you now were. The officer is gone back with his party, but a\r\n    non-commissioned officer and four men remain as a sort of garrison\r\n    in the house. They have hitherto behaved very well, as we are\r\n    forced to keep them in good-humour. But these soldiers have hinted\r\n    as if, on your falling into their hands, you would be in great\r\n    danger; I cannot prevail on myself to write what wicked falsehoods\r\n    they said, for I am sure they are falsehoods; but you will best\r\n    judge what you ought to do. The party that returned carried off\r\n    your servant prisoner, with your two horses, and everything that\r\n    you left at Tully-Veolan. I hope God will protect you, and that you\r\n    will get safe home to England, where you used to tell me there was\r\n    no military violence nor fighting among clans permitted, but\r\n    everything was done according to an equal law that protected all\r\n    who were harmless and innocent. I hope you will exert your\r\n    indulgence as to my boldness in writing to you, where it seems to\r\n    me, though perhaps erroneously, that your safety and honour are\r\n    concerned. I am sure—at least I think, my father would approve of\r\n    my writing; for Mr. Rubrick is fled to his cousin’s at the Duchran,\r\n    to be out of danger from the soldiers and the Whigs, and Bailie\r\n    Macwheeble does not like to meddle (he says) in other men’s\r\n    concerns, though I hope what may serve my father’s friend at such a\r\n    time as this cannot be termed improper interference. Farewell,\r\n    Captain Waverley! I shall probably never see you more; for it would\r\n    be very improper to wish you to call at Tully-Veolan just now, even\r\n    if these men were gone; but I will always remember with gratitude\r\n    your kindness in assisting so poor a scholar as myself, and your\r\n    attentions to my dear, dear father.\r\n\r\n\r\nI remain, your obliged servant,\r\nROSE COMYNE BRADWARDINE.\r\n\r\n\r\nP.S.—I hope you will send me a line by David Gellatley, just to say you\r\nhave received this and that you will take care of yourself; and forgive\r\nme if I entreat you, for your own sake, to join none of these unhappy\r\ncabals, but escape, as fast as possible, to your own fortunate country.\r\nMy compliments to my dear Flora and to Glennaquoich. Is she not as\r\nhandsome and accomplished as I have described her?\r\n\r\n\r\nThus concluded the letter of Rose Bradwardine, the contents of which\r\nboth surprised and affected Waverley. That the Baron should fall under\r\nthe suspicions of government, in consequence of the present stir among\r\nthe partisans of the house of Stuart, seemed only the natural\r\nconsequence of his political predilections; but how _he_ himself should\r\nhave been involved in such suspicions, conscious that until yesterday\r\nhe had been free from harbouring a thought against the prosperity of\r\nthe reigning family, seemed inexplicable. Both at Tully-Veolan and\r\nGlennaquoich his hosts had respected his engagements with the existing\r\ngovernment, and though enough passed by accidental innuendo that might\r\ninduce him to reckon the Baron and the Chief among those disaffected\r\ngentlemen who were still numerous in Scotland, yet until his own\r\nconnection with the army had been broken off by the resumption of his\r\ncommission, he had no reason to suppose that they nourished any\r\nimmediate or hostile attempts against the present establishment. Still\r\nhe was aware that, unless he meant at once to embrace the proposal of\r\nFergus Mac-Ivor, it would deeply concern him to leave the suspicious\r\nneighbourhood without delay, and repair where his conduct might undergo\r\na satisfactory examination. Upon this he the rather determined, as\r\nFlora’s advice favoured his doing so, and because he felt inexpressible\r\nrepugnance at the idea of being accessary to the plague of civil war.\r\nWhatever were the original rights of the Stuarts, calm reflection told\r\nhim that, omitting the question how far James the Second could forfeit\r\nthose of his posterity, he had, according to the united voice of the\r\nwhole nation, justly forfeited his own. Since that period four monarchs\r\nhad reigned in peace and glory over Britain, sustaining and exalting\r\nthe character of the nation abroad and its liberties at home. Reason\r\nasked, was it worth while to disturb a government so long settled and\r\nestablished, and to plunge a kingdom into all the miseries of civil\r\nwar, for the purpose of replacing upon the throne the descendants of a\r\nmonarch by whom it had been wilfully forfeited? If, on the other hand,\r\nhis own final conviction of the goodness of their cause, or the\r\ncommands of his father or uncle, should recommend to him allegiance to\r\nthe Stuarts, still it was necessary to clear his own character by\r\nshowing that he had not, as seemed to be falsely insinuated, taken any\r\nstep to this purpose during his holding the commission of the reigning\r\nmonarch.\r\n\r\nThe affectionate simplicity of Rose and her anxiety for his safety, his\r\nsense too of her unprotected state, and of the terror and actual\r\ndangers to which she might be exposed, made an impression upon his\r\nmind, and he instantly wrote to thank her in the kindest terms for her\r\nsolicitude on his account, to express his earnest good wishes for her\r\nwelfare and that of her father, and to assure her of his own safety.\r\nThe feelings which this task excited were speedily lost in the\r\nnecessity which he now saw of bidding farewell to Flora Mac-Ivor,\r\nperhaps for ever. The pang attending this reflection was inexpressible;\r\nfor her high-minded elevation of character, her self-devotion to the\r\ncause which she had embraced, united to her scrupulous rectitude as to\r\nthe means of serving it, had vindicated to his judgment the choice\r\nadopted by his passions. But time pressed, calumny was busy with his\r\nfame, and every hour’s delay increased the power to injure it. His\r\ndeparture must be instant.\r\n\r\nWith this determination he sought out Fergus, and communicated to him\r\nthe contents of Rose’s letter, with his own resolution instantly to go\r\nto Edinburgh, and put into the hands of some one or other of those\r\npersons of influence to whom he had letters from his father his\r\nexculpation from any charge which might be preferred against him.\r\n\r\n“You run your head into the lion’s mouth,” answered Mac-Ivor. “You do\r\nnot know the severity of a government harassed by just apprehensions,\r\nand a consciousness of their own illegality and insecurity. I shall\r\nhave to deliver you from some dungeon in Stirling or Edinburgh Castle.”\r\n\r\n“My innocence, my rank, my father’s intimacy with Lord M——, General\r\nG——, etc., will be a sufficient protection,” said Waverley.\r\n\r\n“You will find the contrary,” replied the Chieftain, “these gentlemen\r\nwill have enough to do about their own matters. Once more, will you\r\ntake the plaid, and stay a little while with us among the mists and the\r\ncrows, in the bravest cause ever sword was drawn in?”[*]\r\n\r\n[* A Highland rhyme on Glencairn’s Expedition, in 1650, has these\r\nlines—\r\n\r\n\r\nWe’ll bide a while amang ta crows,\r\nWe’ll wiske ta sword and bend ta bows]\r\n\r\n\r\n“For many reasons, my dear Fergus, you must hold me excused.”\r\n\r\n“Well then,” said Mac-Ivor, “I shall certainly find you exerting your\r\npoetical talents in elegies upon a prison, or your antiquarian\r\nresearches in detecting the Oggam[*] character or some Punic\r\nhieroglyphic upon the keystones of a vault, curiously arched. Or what\r\nsay you to _un petit pendement bien joli?_ against which awkward\r\nceremony I don’t warrant you, should you meet a body of the armed\r\nWest-Country Whigs.”\r\n\r\n[* The Oggam is a species of the old Irish character. The idea of the\r\ncorrespondence betwixt the Celtic and Punic, founded on a scene in\r\nPlautus, was not started till General Vallancey set up his theory, long\r\nafter the date of Fergus Mac-Ivor]\r\n\r\n\r\n“And why should they use me so?” said Waverley.\r\n\r\n“For a hundred good reasons,” answered Fergus. “First, you are an\r\nEnglishman; secondly, a gentleman; thirdly, a prelatist abjured; and,\r\nfourthly, they have not had an opportunity to exercise their talents on\r\nsuch a subject this long while. But don’t be cast down, beloved; all\r\nwill be done in the fear of the Lord.”\r\n\r\n“Well, I must run my hazard.”\r\n\r\n“You are determined, then?”\r\n\r\n“I am.”\r\n\r\n“Wilful will do’t” said Fergus. “But you cannot go on foot, and I shall\r\nwant no horse, as I must march on foot at the head of the children of\r\nIvor; you shall have brown Dermid.”\r\n\r\n“If you will sell him, I shall certainly be much obliged.”\r\n\r\n“If your proud English heart cannot be obliged by a gift or loan, I\r\nwill not refuse money at the entrance of a campaign: his price is\r\ntwenty guineas. [Remember, reader, it was Sixty Years Since.] And when\r\ndo you propose to depart?”\r\n\r\n“The sooner the better,” answered Waverley.\r\n\r\n“You are right, since go you must, or rather, since go you will. I will\r\ntake Flora’s pony and ride with you as far as Bally-Brough. Callum Beg,\r\nsee that our horses are ready, with a pony for yourself, to attend and\r\ncarry Mr. Waverley’s baggage as far as —— (naming a small town), where\r\nhe can have a horse and guide to Edinburgh. Put on a Lowland dress,\r\nCallum, and see you keep your tongue close, if you would not have me\r\ncut it out. Mr. Waverley rides Dermid.” Then turning to Edward, “You\r\nwill take leave of my sister?”\r\n\r\n“Surely—that is, if Miss Mac-Ivor will honour me so far.”\r\n\r\n“Cathleen, let my sister know Mr. Waverley wishes to bid her farewell\r\nbefore he leaves us. But Rose Bradwardine, her situation must be\r\nthought of; I wish she were here. And why should she not? There are but\r\nfour red-coats at Tully-Veolan, and their muskets would be very useful\r\nto us.”\r\n\r\nTo these broken remarks Edward made no answer; his ear indeed received\r\nthem, but his soul was intent upon the expected entrance of Flora. The\r\ndoor opened. It was but Cathleen, with her lady’s excuse, and wishes\r\nfor Captain Waverley’s health and happiness.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXIX.\r\nWAVERLEY’S RECEPTION IN THE LOWLANDS AFTER HIS HIGHLAND TOUR\r\n\r\n\r\nIt was noon when the two friends stood at the top of the pass of\r\nBally-Brough. “I must go no farther,” said Fergus Mac-Ivor, who during\r\nthe journey had in vain endeavoured to raise his friend’s spirits. “If\r\nmy cross-grained sister has any share in your dejection, trust me she\r\nthinks highly of you, though her present anxiety about the public cause\r\nprevents her listening to any other subject. Confide your interest to\r\nme; I will not betray it, providing you do not again assume that vile\r\ncockade.”\r\n\r\n“No fear of that, considering the manner in which it has been recalled.\r\nAdieu, Fergus; do not permit your sister to forget me.”\r\n\r\n“And adieu, Waverley; you may soon hear of her with a prouder title.\r\nGet home, write letters, and make friends as many and as fast as you\r\ncan; there will speedily be unexpected guests on the coast of Suffolk,\r\nor my news from France has deceived me.”[*]\r\n\r\n[* The sanguine Jacobites, during the eventful years 1745–46, kept up\r\nthe spirits of their party by the rumour of descents from France on\r\nbehalf of the Chevalier St. George.]\r\n\r\n\r\nThus parted the friends; Fergus returning back to his castle, while\r\nEdward, followed by Callum Beg, the latter transformed from point to\r\npoint into a Low-Country groom, proceeded to the little town of ——.\r\n\r\nEdward paced on under the painful and yet not altogether embittered\r\nfeelings which separation and uncertainty produce in the mind of a\r\nyouthful lover. I am not sure if the ladies understand the full value\r\nof the influence of absence, nor do I think it wise to teach it them,\r\nlest, like the Clelias and Mandanes of yore, they should resume the\r\nhumour of sending their lovers into banishment. Distance, in truth,\r\nproduces in idea the same effect as in real perspective. Objects are\r\nsoftened, and rounded, and rendered doubly graceful; the harsher and\r\nmore ordinary points of character are mellowed down, and those by which\r\nit is remembered are the more striking outlines that mark sublimity,\r\ngrace, or beauty. There are mists too in the mental as well as the\r\nnatural horizon, to conceal what is less pleasing in distant objects,\r\nand there are happy lights, to stream in full glory upon those points\r\nwhich can profit by brilliant illumination.\r\n\r\nWaverley forgot Flora Mac-Ivor’s prejudices in her magnanimity, and\r\nalmost pardoned her indifference towards his affection when he\r\nrecollected the grand and decisive object which seemed to fill her\r\nwhole soul. She, whose sense of duty so wholly engrossed her in the\r\ncause of a benefactor, what would be her feelings in favour of the\r\nhappy individual who should be so fortunate as to awaken them? Then\r\ncame the doubtful question, whether he might not be that happy man,—a\r\nquestion which fancy endeavoured to answer in the affirmative, by\r\nconjuring up all she had said in his praise, with the addition of a\r\ncomment much more flattering than the text warranted. All that was\r\ncommonplace, all that belonged to the every-day world, was melted away\r\nand obliterated in those dreams of imagination, which only remembered\r\nwith advantage the points of grace and dignity that distinguished Flora\r\nfrom the generality of her sex, not the particulars which she held in\r\ncommon with them. Edward was, in short, in the fair way of creating a\r\ngoddess out of a high-spirited, accomplished, and beautiful young\r\nwoman; and the time was wasted in castle-building until, at the descent\r\nof a steep hill, he saw beneath him the market-town of ——.\r\n\r\nThe Highland politeness of Callum Beg—there are few nations, by the\r\nway, who can boast of so much natural politeness as the\r\nHighlanders[*]—the Highland civility of his attendant had not permitted\r\nhim to disturb the reveries of our hero. But observing him rouse\r\nhimself at the sight of the village, Callum pressed closer to his side,\r\nand hoped “when they cam to the public, his honour wad not say nothing\r\nabout Vich Ian Vohr, for ta people were bitter Whigs, deil burst tem.”\r\n\r\n[* The Highlander, in former times, had always a high idea of his own\r\ngentility, and was anxious to impress the same upon those with whom he\r\nconversed. His language abounded in the phrases of courtesy and\r\ncompliment; and the habit of carrying arms, and mixing with those who\r\ndid so, made it particularly desirable they should use cautious\r\npoliteness in their intercourse with each other.]\r\n\r\n\r\nWaverley assured the prudent page that he would be cautious; and as he\r\nnow distinguished, not indeed the ringing of bells, but the tinkling of\r\nsomething like a hammer against the side of an old mossy, green,\r\ninverted porridge-pot that hung in an open booth, of the size and shape\r\nof a parrot’s cage, erected to grace the east end of a building\r\nresembling an old barn, he asked Callum Beg if it were Sunday.\r\n\r\n“Could na say just preceesely; Sunday seldom cam aboon the pass of\r\nBally-Brough.”\r\n\r\nOn entering the town, however, and advancing towards the most apparent\r\npublic-house which presented itself, the numbers of old women, in\r\ntartan screens and red cloaks, who streamed from the barn-resembling\r\nbuilding, debating as they went the comparative merits of the blessed\r\nyouth Jabesh Rentowel and that chosen vessel Maister Goukthrapple,\r\ninduced Callum to assure his temporary master “that it was either ta\r\nmuckle Sunday hersell, or ta little government Sunday that they ca’d ta\r\nfast.”\r\n\r\nOn alighting at the sign of the Seven-branched Golden Candlestick,\r\nwhich, for the further delectation of the guests, was graced with a\r\nshort Hebrew motto, they were received by mine host, a tall thin\r\npuritanical figure, who seemed to debate with himself whether he ought\r\nto give shelter to those who travelled on such a day. Reflecting,\r\nhowever, in all probability, that he possessed the power of mulcting\r\nthem for this irregularity, a penalty which they might escape by\r\npassing into Gregor Duncanson’s, at the sign of the Highlander and the\r\nHawick Gill, Mr. Ebenezer Cruickshanks condescended to admit them into\r\nhis dwelling.\r\n\r\nTo this sanctified person Waverley addressed his request that he would\r\nprocure him a guide, with a saddle-horse, to carry his portmanteau to\r\nEdinburgh.\r\n\r\n“And whar may ye be coming from?” demanded mine host of the\r\nCandlestick.\r\n\r\n“I have told you where I wish to go; I do not conceive any further\r\ninformation necessary either for the guide or his saddle-horse.”\r\n\r\n“Hem! Ahem!” returned he of the Candlestick, somewhat disconcerted at\r\nthis rebuff. “It’s the general fast, sir, and I cannot enter into ony\r\ncarnal transactions on sic a day, when the people should be humbled and\r\nthe backsliders should return, as worthy Mr. Goukthrapple said; and\r\nmoreover when, as the precious Mr. Jabesh Rentowel did weel observe,\r\nthe land was mourning for covenants burnt, broken, and buried.”\r\n\r\n“My good friend,” said Waverley, “if you cannot let me have a horse and\r\nguide, my servant shall seek them elsewhere.”\r\n\r\n“Aweel! Your servant? and what for gangs he not forward wi’ you\r\nhimsell?”\r\n\r\nWaverley had but very little of a captain of horse’s spirit within\r\nhim—I mean of that sort of spirit which I have been obliged to when I\r\nhappened, in a mail coach or diligence, to meet some military man who\r\nhas kindly taken upon him the disciplining of the waiters and the\r\ntaxing of reckonings. Some of this useful talent our hero had, however,\r\nacquired during his military service, and on this gross provocation it\r\nbegan seriously to arise. “Look ye, sir; I came here for my own\r\naccommodation, and not to answer impertinent questions. Either say you\r\ncan, or cannot, get me what I want; I shall pursue my course in either\r\ncase.”\r\n\r\nMr. Ebenezer Cruickshanks left the room with some indistinct\r\nmutterings; but whether negative or acquiescent, Edward could not well\r\ndistinguish. The hostess, a civil, quiet, laborious drudge, came to\r\ntake his orders for dinner, but declined to make answer on the subject\r\nof the horse and guide; for the Salique law, it seems, extended to the\r\nstables of the Golden Candlestick.\r\n\r\nFrom a window which overlooked the dark and narrow court in which\r\nCallum Beg rubbed down the horses after their journey, Waverley heard\r\nthe following dialogue betwixt the subtle foot-page of Vich Ian Vohr\r\nand his landlord:—\r\n\r\n“Ye’ll be frae the north, young man?” began the latter.\r\n\r\n“And ye may say that,” answered Callum.\r\n\r\n“And ye’ll hae ridden a lang way the day, it may weel be?”\r\n\r\n“Sae lang, that I could weel tak a dram.”\r\n\r\n“Gudewife, bring the gill stoup.”\r\n\r\nHere some compliments passed fitting the occasion, when my host of the\r\nGolden Candlestick, having, as he thought, opened his guest’s heart by\r\nthis hospitable propitiation, resumed his scrutiny.\r\n\r\n“Ye’ll no hae mickle better whisky than that aboon the Pass?”\r\n\r\n“I am nae frae aboon the Pass.”\r\n\r\n“Ye’re a Highlandman by your tongue?”\r\n\r\n“Na; I am but just Aberdeen-a-way.”\r\n\r\n“And did your master come frae Aberdeen wi’ you?”\r\n\r\n“Ay; that’s when I left it mysell,” answered the cool and impenetrable\r\nCallum Beg.\r\n\r\n“And what kind of a gentleman is he?”\r\n\r\n“I believe he is ane o’ King George’s state officers; at least he’s aye\r\nfor ganging on to the south, and he has a hantle siller, and never\r\ngrudges onything till a poor body, or in the way of a lawing.”\r\n\r\n“He wants a guide and a horse frae hence to Edinburgh?”\r\n\r\n“Ay, and ye maun find it him forthwith.”\r\n\r\n“Ahem! It will be chargeable.”\r\n\r\n“He cares na for that a bodle.”\r\n\r\n“Aweel, Duncan—did ye say your name was Duncan, or Donald?”\r\n\r\n“Na, man—Jamie—Jamie Steenson—I telt ye before.”\r\n\r\nThis last undaunted parry altogether foiled Mr. Cruickshanks, who,\r\nthough not quite satisfied either with the reserve of the master or the\r\nextreme readiness of the man, was contented to lay a tax on the\r\nreckoning and horse-hire that might compound for his ungratified\r\ncuriosity. The circumstance of its being the fast day was not forgotten\r\nin the charge, which, on the whole, did not, however, amount to much\r\nmore than double what in fairness it should have been.\r\n\r\nCallum Beg soon after announced in person the ratification of this\r\ntreaty, adding, “Ta auld deevil was ganging to ride wi’ ta\r\n_duinhé-wassel_ hersell.”\r\n\r\n“That will not be very pleasant, Callum, nor altogether safe, for our\r\nhost seems a person of great curiosity; but a traveller must submit to\r\nthese inconveniences. Meanwhile, my good lad, here is a trifle for you\r\nto drink Vich Ian Vohr’s health.”\r\n\r\nThe hawk’s eye of Callum flashed delight upon a golden guinea, with\r\nwhich these last words were accompanied. He hastened, not without a\r\ncurse on the intricacies of a Saxon breeches pocket, or “spleuchan,” as\r\nhe called it, to deposit the treasure in his fob; and then, as if he\r\nconceived the benevolence called for some requital on his part, he\r\ngathered close up to Edward, with an expression of countenance\r\npeculiarly knowing, and spoke in an undertone, “If his honour thought\r\nta auld deevil Whig carle was a bit dangerous, she could easily provide\r\nfor him, and teil ane ta wiser.”\r\n\r\n“How, and in what manner?”\r\n\r\n“Her ain sell,” replied Callum, “could wait for him a wee bit frae the\r\ntoun, and kittle his quarters wi’her _skene-occle_.”\r\n\r\n“‘Skene-occle!’ what’s that?”\r\n\r\nCallum unbuttoned his coat, raised his left arm, and, with an emphatic\r\nnod, pointed to the hilt of a small dirk, snugly deposited under it, in\r\nthe lining of his jacket. Waverley thought he had misunderstood his\r\nmeaning; he gazed in his face, and discovered in Callum’s very handsome\r\nthough embrowned features just the degree of roguish malice with which\r\na lad of the same age in England would have brought forward a plan for\r\nrobbing an orchard.\r\n\r\n“Good God, Callum, would you take the man’s life?”\r\n\r\n“Indeed,” answered the young desperado, “and I think he has had just a\r\nlang enough lease o ’t, when he’s for betraying honest folk that come\r\nto spend siller at his public.”\r\n\r\nEdward saw nothing was to be gained by argument, and therefore\r\ncontented himself with enjoining Callum to lay aside all practices\r\nagainst the person of Mr. Ebenezer Cruickshanks; in which injunction\r\nthe page seemed to acquiesce with an air of great indifference.\r\n\r\n“Ta _duinhé-wassel_ might please himsell; ta auld rudas loon had never\r\ndone Callum nae ill. But here’s a bit line frae ta Tighearna, tat he\r\nbade me gie your honour ere I came back.”\r\n\r\nThe letter from the Chief contained Flora’s lines on the fate of\r\nCaptain Wogan, whose enterprising character is so well drawn by\r\nClarendon. He had originally engaged in the service of the Parliament,\r\nbut had abjured that party upon the execution of Charles I; and upon\r\nhearing that the royal standard was set up by the Earl of Glencairn and\r\nGeneral Middleton in the Highlands of Scotland, took leave of Charles\r\nII, who was then at Paris, passed into England, assembled a body of\r\nCavaliers in the neighbourhood of London, and traversed the kingdom,\r\nwhich had been so long under domination of the usurper, by marches\r\nconducted with such skill, dexterity, and spirit that he safely united\r\nhis handful of horsemen with the body of Highlanders then in arms.\r\nAfter several months of desultory warfare, in which Wogan’s skill and\r\ncourage gained him the highest reputation, he had the misfortune to be\r\nwounded in a dangerous manner, and no surgical assistance being within\r\nreach he terminated his short but glorious career.\r\n\r\nThere were obvious reasons why the politic Chieftain was desirous to\r\nplace the example of this young hero under the eye of Waverley, with\r\nwhose romantic disposition it coincided so peculiarly. But his letter\r\nturned chiefly upon some trifling commissions which Waverley had\r\npromised to execute for him in England, and it was only toward the\r\nconclusion that Edward found these words: “I owe Flora a grudge for\r\nrefusing us her company yesterday; and, as I am giving you the trouble\r\nof reading these lines, in order to keep in your memory your promise to\r\nprocure me the fishing-tackle and cross-bow from London, I will enclose\r\nher verses on the Grave of Wogan. This I know will tease her; for, to\r\ntell you the truth, I think her more in love with the memory of that\r\ndead hero than she is likely to be with any living one, unless he shall\r\ntread a similar path. But English squires of our day keep their\r\noak-trees to shelter their deer parks, or repair the losses of an\r\nevening at White’s, and neither invoke them to wreathe their brows nor\r\nshelter their graves. Let me hope for one brilliant exception in a dear\r\nfriend, to whom I would most gladly give a dearer title.”\r\n\r\nThe verses were inscribed,\r\n\r\nTO AN OAK TREE\r\n\r\n\r\n_In the Churchyard of ——, in the Highlands of Scotland, said to mark\r\nthe Grave of Captain Wogan, killed in_ 1649.\r\n\r\n\r\nEmblem of England’s ancient faith,\r\n    Full proudly may thy branches wave,\r\nWhere loyalty lies low in death,\r\n    And valour fills a timeless grave.\r\n\r\nAnd thou, brave tenant of the tomb!\r\n    Repine not if our clime deny,\r\nAbove thine honour’d sod to bloom\r\n    The flowerets of a milder sky.\r\n\r\nThese owe their birth to genial May;\r\n    Beneath a fiercer sun they pine,\r\nBefore the winter storm decay;\r\n    And can their worth be type of thine?\r\n\r\nNo! for, ’mid storms of Fate opposing,\r\n    Still higher swell’d thy dauntless heart,\r\nAnd, while Despair the scene was closing,\r\n    Commenced thy brief but brilliant part.\r\n\r\n’T was then thou sought’st on Albyn’s hill,\r\n    (When England’s sons the strife resign’d)\r\nA rugged race resisting still,\r\n    And unsubdued though unrefined.\r\n\r\nThy death’s hour heard no kindred wail,\r\n    No holy knell thy requiem rung;\r\nThy mourners were the plaided Gael,\r\n    Thy dirge the clamourous pibroch sung.\r\n\r\nYet who, in Fortune’s summer-shine\r\n    To waste life’s longest term away,\r\nWould change that glorious dawn of thine,\r\n    Though darken’d ere its noontide day!\r\n\r\nBe thine the tree whose dauntless boughs\r\n    Brave summer’s drought and winter’s gloom.\r\nRome bound with oak her patriots’ brows,\r\n    As Albyn shadows Wogan’s tomb.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhatever might be the real merit of Flora Mac-Ivor’s poetry, the\r\nenthusiasm which it intimated was well calculated to make a\r\ncorresponding impression upon her lover. The lines were read—read\r\nagain, then deposited in Waverley’s bosom, then again drawn out, and\r\nread line by line, in a low and smothered voice, and with frequent\r\npauses which prolonged the mental treat, as an epicure protracts, by\r\nsipping slowly, the enjoyment of a delicious beverage. The entrance of\r\nMrs. Cruickshanks with the sublunary articles of dinner and wine hardly\r\ninterrupted this pantomime of affectionate enthusiasm.\r\n\r\nAt length the tall ungainly figure and ungracious visage of Ebenezer\r\npresented themselves. The upper part of his form, notwithstanding the\r\nseason required no such defence, was shrouded in a large great-coat,\r\nbelted over his under habiliments, and crested with a huge cowl of the\r\nsame stuff, which, when drawn over the head and hat, completely\r\novershadowed both, and, being buttoned beneath the chin, was called a\r\ntrot-cozy. His hand grasped a huge jockey-whip, garnished with\r\nbrassmounting. His thin legs tenanted a pair of gambadoes, fastened at\r\nthe sides with rusty clasps. Thus accoutred, he stalked into the midst\r\nof the apartment, and announced his errand in brief phrase: “Yer horses\r\nare ready.”\r\n\r\n“You go with me yourself then, landlord?”\r\n\r\n“I do, as far as Perth; where ye may be supplied with a guide to\r\nEmbro’, as your occasions shall require.”\r\n\r\nThus saying, he placed under Waverley’s eye the bill which he held in\r\nhis hand; and at the same time, self-invited, filled a glass of wine\r\nand drank devoutly to a blessing on their journey. Waverley stared at\r\nthe man’s impudence, but, as their connection was to be short and\r\npromised to be convenient, he made no observation upon it; and, having\r\npaid his reckoning, expressed his intention to depart immediately. He\r\nmounted Dermid accordingly and sallied forth from the Golden\r\nCandlestick, followed by the puritanical figure we have described,\r\nafter he had, at the expense of some time and difficulty, and by the\r\nassistance of a “louping-on-stane,” or structure of masonry erected for\r\nthe traveller’s convenience in front of the house, elevated his person\r\nto the back of a long-backed, raw-boned, thin-gutted phantom of a\r\nbroken-down blood-horse, on which Waverley’s portmanteau was deposited.\r\nOur hero, though not in a very gay humour, could hardly help laughing\r\nat the appearance of his new squire, and at imagining the astonishment\r\nwhich his person and equipage would have excited at Waverley-Honour.\r\n\r\nEdward’s tendency to mirth did not escape mine host of the Candlestick,\r\nwho, conscious of the cause, infused a double portion of souring into\r\nthe pharisaical leaven of his countenance, and resolved internally\r\nthat, in one way or other, the young _Englisher_ should pay dearly for\r\nthe contempt with which he seemed to regard him. Callum also stood at\r\nthe gate and enjoyed, with undissembled glee, the ridiculous figure of\r\nMr. Cruickshanks. As Waverley passed him he pulled off his hat\r\nrespectfully, and, approaching his stirrup, bade him “Tak heed the auld\r\nwhig deevil played him nae cantrip.”\r\n\r\nWaverley once more thanked and bade him farewell, and then rode briskly\r\nonward, not sorry to be out of hearing of the shouts of the children,\r\nas they beheld old Ebenezer rise and sink in his stirrups to avoid the\r\nconcussions occasioned by a hard trot upon a half-paved street. The\r\nvillage of —— was soon several miles behind him.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWAVERLEY\r\n\r\nOR\r\n\r\n’TIS SIXTY YEARS SINCE\r\n\r\nVOLUME II.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER I.\r\nSHOWS THAT THE LOSS OF A HORSE’S SHOE MAY BE A SERIOUS INCONVENIENCE\r\n\r\n\r\nThe manner and air of Waverley, but, above all, the glittering contents\r\nof his purse, and the indifference with which he seemed to regard them,\r\nsomewhat overawed his companion, and deterred him from making any\r\nattempts to enter upon conversation. His own reflections were moreover\r\nagitated by various surmises, and by plans of self-interest with which\r\nthese were intimately connected. The travellers journeyed, therefore,\r\nin silence, until it was interrupted by the annunciation, on the part\r\nof the guide, that his “naig had lost a fore-foot shoe, which,\r\ndoubtless, his honour would consider it was his part to replace.”\r\n\r\nThis was what lawyers call a fishing question, calculated to ascertain\r\nhow far Waverley was disposed to submit to petty imposition. “My part\r\nto replace your horse’s shoe, you rascal!” said Waverley, mistaking the\r\npurport of the intimation.\r\n\r\n“Indubitably,” answered Mr. Cruickshanks; “though there was no preceese\r\nclause to that effect, it canna be expected that I am to pay for the\r\ncasualties whilk may befall the puir naig while in your honour’s\r\nservice. Nathless, if your honour—”\r\n\r\n“O, you mean I am to pay the farrier; but where shall we find one?”\r\n\r\nRejoiced at discerning there would be no objection made on the part of\r\nhis temporary master, Mr. Cruickshanks assured him that Cairnvreckan, a\r\nvillage which they were about to enter, was happy in an excellent\r\nblacksmith; “but as he was a professor, he would drive a nail for no\r\nman on the Sabbath or kirk-fast, unless it were in a case of absolute\r\nnecessity, for which he always charged sixpence each shoe.” The most\r\nimportant part of this communication, in the opinion of the speaker,\r\nmade a very slight impression on the hearer, who only internally\r\nwondered what college this veterinary professor belonged to, not aware\r\nthat the word was used to denote any person who pretended to uncommon\r\nsanctity of faith and manner.\r\n\r\nAs they entered the village of Cairnvreckan, they speedily\r\ndistinguished the smith’s house. Being also a public, it was two\r\nstories high, and proudly reared its crest, covered with grey slate,\r\nabove the thatched hovels by which it was surrounded. The adjoining\r\nsmithy betokened none of the Sabbatical silence and repose which\r\nEbenezer had augured from the sanctity of his friend. On the contrary,\r\nhammer clashed and anvil rang, the bellows groaned, and the whole\r\napparatus of Vulcan appeared to be in full activity. Nor was the labour\r\nof a rural and pacific nature. The master smith, benempt, as his sign\r\nintimated, John Mucklewrath, with two assistants, toiled busily in\r\narranging, repairing, and furbishing old muskets, pistols, and swords,\r\nwhich lay scattered around his workshop in military confusion. The open\r\nshed, containing the forge, was crowded with persons who came and went\r\nas if receiving and communicating important news, and a single glance\r\nat the aspect of the people who traversed the street in haste, or stood\r\nassembled in groups, with eyes elevated and hands uplifted, announced\r\nthat some extraordinary intelligence was agitating the public mind of\r\nthe municipality of Cairnvreckan. “There is some news,” said mine host\r\nof the Candlestick, pushing his lantern-jawed visage and bare-boned nag\r\nrudely forward into the crowd—“there is some news; and, if it please my\r\nCreator, I will forthwith obtain speirings thereof.”\r\n\r\nWaverley, with better regulated curiosity than his attendant’s,\r\ndismounted and gave his horse to a boy who stood idling near. It arose,\r\nperhaps, from the shyness of his character in early youth, that he felt\r\ndislike at applying to a stranger even for casual information, without\r\npreviously glancing at his physiognomy and appearance. While he looked\r\nabout in order to select the person with whom he would most willingly\r\nhold communication, the buzz around saved him in some degree the\r\ntrouble of interrogatories. The names of Lochiel, Clanronald,\r\nGlengarry, and other distinguished Highland Chiefs, among whom Vich Ian\r\nVohr was repeatedly mentioned, were as familiar in men’s mouths as\r\nhousehold words; and from the alarm generally expressed, he easily\r\nconceived that their descent into the Lowlands, at the head of their\r\narmed tribes, had either already taken place or was instantly\r\napprehended.\r\n\r\nEre Waverley could ask particulars, a strong, large-boned,\r\nhard-featured woman, about forty, dressed as if her clothes had been\r\nflung on with a pitchfork, her cheeks flushed with a scarlet red where\r\nthey were not smutted with soot and lamp-black, jostled through the\r\ncrowd, and, brandishing high a child of two years old, which she danced\r\nin her arms without regard to its screams of terror, sang forth with\r\nall her might,—\r\n\r\nCharlie is my darling, my darling, my darling,\r\nCharlie is my darling,\r\n        The young Chevalier!\r\n\r\n\r\n“D’ ye hear what’s come ower ye now,” continued the virago, “ye\r\nwhingeing Whig carles? D’ye hear wha’s coming to cow yer cracks?\r\n\r\nLittle wot ye wha’s coming,\r\nLittle wot ye wha’s coming,\r\n        A’ the wild Macraws are coming.”\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Vulcan of Cairnvreckan, who acknowledged his Venus in this exulting\r\nBacchante, regarded her with a grim and ire-foreboding countenance,\r\nwhile some of the senators of the village hastened to interpose.\r\n“Whisht, gudewife; is this a time or is this a day to be singing your\r\nranting fule sangs in?—a time when the wine of wrath is poured out\r\nwithout mixture in the cup of indignation, and a day when the land\r\nshould give testimony against popery, and prelacy, and quakerism, and\r\nindependency, and supremacy, and erastianism, and antinomianism, and a’\r\nthe errors of the church?”\r\n\r\n“And that’s a’ your Whiggery,” reechoed the Jacobite heroine; “that’s\r\na’ your Whiggery, and your presbytery, ye cut-lugged, graning carles!\r\nWhat! d’ ye think the lads wi’ the kilts will care for yer synods and\r\nyer presbyteries, and yer buttock-mail, and yer stool o’ repentance?\r\nVengeance on the black face o’t! mony an honester woman’s been set upon\r\nit than streeks doon beside ony Whig in the country. I mysell—”\r\n\r\nHere John Mucklewrath, who dreaded her entering upon a detail of\r\npersonal experience, interposed his matrimonial authority. “Gae hame,\r\nand be d—— (that I should say sae), and put on the sowens for supper.”\r\n\r\n“And you, ye doil’d dotard,” replied his gentle helpmate, her wrath,\r\nwhich had hitherto wandered abroad over the whole assembly, being at\r\nonce and violently impelled into its natural channel, “_ye_ stand there\r\nhammering dog-heads for fules that will never snap them at a\r\nHighlandman, instead of earning bread for your family and shoeing this\r\nwinsome young gentleman’s horse that’s just come frae the north! I’se\r\nwarrant him nane of your whingeing King George folk, but a gallant\r\nGordon, at the least o’ him.”\r\n\r\nThe eyes of the assembly were now turned upon Waverley, who took the\r\nopportunity to beg the smith to shoe his guide’s horse with all speed,\r\nas he wished to proceed on his journey; for he had heard enough to make\r\nhim sensible that there would be danger in delaying long in this place.\r\nThe smith’s eyes rested on him with a look of displeasure and\r\nsuspicion, not lessened by the eagerness with which his wife enforced\r\nWaverley’s mandate. “D’ye hear what the weel-favoured young gentleman\r\nsays, ye drunken ne’er-do-good?”\r\n\r\n“And what may your name be, sir?” quoth Mucklewrath.\r\n\r\n“It is of no consequence to you, my friend, provided I pay your\r\nlabour.”\r\n\r\n“But it may be of consequence to the state, sir,” replied an old\r\nfarmer, smelling strongly of whisky and peat-smoke; “and I doubt we\r\nmaun delay your journey till you have seen the Laird.”\r\n\r\n“You certainly,” said Waverley, haughtily, “will find it both difficult\r\nand dangerous to detain me, unless you can produce some proper\r\nauthority.”\r\n\r\nThere was a pause and a whisper among the crowd,—“Secretary\r\nMurray;” “Lord Lewis Gordon;” “Maybe the Chevalier himsell!” Such were\r\nthe surmises that passed hurriedly among them, and there was obviously\r\nan increased disposition to resist Waverley’s departure. He attempted\r\nto argue mildly with them, but his voluntary ally, Mrs. Mucklewrath,\r\nbroke in upon and drowned his expostulations, taking his part with an\r\nabusive violence which was all set down to Edward’s account by those on\r\nwhom it was bestowed. “_Ye’ll_ stop ony gentleman that’s the Prince’s\r\nfreend?” for she too, though with other feelings, had adopted the\r\ngeneral opinion respecting Waverley. “I daur ye to touch him,”\r\nspreading abroad her long and muscular fingers, garnished with claws\r\nwhich a vulture might have envied. “I’ll set my ten commandments in the\r\nface o’ the first loon that lays a finger on him.”\r\n\r\n“Gae hame, gudewife,” quoth the farmer aforesaid; “it wad better set\r\nyou to be nursing the gudeman’s bairns than to be deaving us here.”\r\n\r\n“_His_ bairns?” retorted the Amazon, regarding her husband with a grin\r\nof ineffable contempt—“_His_ bairns!\r\n\r\nO gin ye were dead, gudeman,\r\n    And a green turf on your head, gudeman!\r\nThen I wad ware my widowhood\r\n    Upon a ranting Highlandman\r\n\r\n\r\nThis canticle, which excited a suppressed titter among the younger part\r\nof the audience, totally overcame the patience of the taunted man of\r\nthe anvil. “Deil be in me but I’ll put this het gad down her throat!”\r\ncried he in an ecstasy of wrath, snatching a bar from the forge; and he\r\nmight have executed his threat, had he not been withheld by a part of\r\nthe mob, while the rest endeavoured to force the termagant out of his\r\npresence.\r\n\r\nWaverley meditated a retreat in the confusion, but his horse was\r\nnowhere to be seen. At length he observed at some distance his faithful\r\nattendant, Ebenezer, who, as soon as he had perceived the turn matters\r\nwere likely to take, had withdrawn both horses from the press, and,\r\nmounted on the one and holding the other, answered the loud and\r\nrepeated calls of Waverley for his horse. “Na, na! if ye are nae friend\r\nto kirk and the king, and are detained as siccan a person, ye maun\r\nanswer to honest men of the country for breach of contract; and I maun\r\nkeep the naig and the walise for damage and expense, in respect my\r\nhorse and mysell will lose to-morrow’s day’s wark, besides the\r\nafternoon preaching.”\r\n\r\nEdward, out of patience, hemmed in and hustled by the rabble on every\r\nside, and every moment expecting personal violence, resolved to try\r\nmeasures of intimidation, and at length drew a pocket-pistol,\r\nthreatening, on the one hand, to shoot whomsoever dared to stop him,\r\nand, on the other, menacing Ebenezer with a similar doom if he stirred\r\na foot with the horses. The sapient Partridge says that one man with a\r\npistol is equal to a hundred unarmed, because, though he can shoot but\r\none of the multitude, yet no one knows but that he himself may be that\r\nluckless individual. The _levy en masse_ of Cairnvreckan would\r\ntherefore probably have given way, nor would Ebenezer, whose natural\r\npaleness had waxed three shades more cadaverous, have ventured to\r\ndispute a mandate so enforced, had not the Vulcan of the village, eager\r\nto discharge upon some more worthy object the fury which his helpmate\r\nhad provoked, and not ill satisfied to find such an object in Waverley,\r\nrushed at him with the red-hot bar of iron with such determination as\r\nmade the discharge of his pistol an act of self-defence. The\r\nunfortunate man fell; and while Edward, thrilled with a natural horror\r\nat the incident, neither had presence of mind to unsheathe his sword\r\nnor to draw his remaining pistol, the populace threw themselves upon\r\nhim, disarmed him, and were about to use him with great violence, when\r\nthe appearance of a venerable clergyman, the pastor of the parish, put\r\na curb on their fury.\r\n\r\nThis worthy man (none of the Goukthrapples or Rentowels) maintained his\r\ncharacter with the common people, although he preached the practical\r\nfruits of Christian faith as well as its abstract tenets, and was\r\nrespected by the higher orders, notwithstanding he declined soothing\r\ntheir speculative errors by converting the pulpit of the gospel into a\r\nschool of heathen morality. Perhaps it is owing to this mixture of\r\nfaith and practice in his doctrine that, although his memory has formed\r\na sort of era in the annals of Cairnvreckan, so that the parishioners,\r\nto denote what befell Sixty Years Since, still say it happened “in good\r\nMr. Morton’s time,” I have never been able to discover which he\r\nbelonged to, the evangelical or the moderate party in the kirk. Nor do\r\nI hold the circumstance of much moment, since, in my own remembrance,\r\nthe one was headed by an Erskine, the other by a Robertson.[*]\r\n\r\n[* The Reverend John Erskine, D. D, an eminent Scottish divine and a\r\nmost excellent man, headed the Evangelical party in the Church of\r\nScotland at the time when the celebrated Doctor Robertson, the\r\nhistorian, was the leader of the Moderate party. These two\r\ndistinguished persons were colleagues in the Old Grey Friars’ Church,\r\nEdinburgh; and, however much they differed in church politics,\r\npreserved the most perfect harmony as private friends and as clergymen\r\nserving the same cure]\r\n\r\n\r\nMr. Morton had been alarmed by the discharge of the pistol and the\r\nincreasing hubbub around the smithy. His first attention, after he had\r\ndirected the bystanders to detain Waverley, but to abstain from\r\ninjuring him, was turned to the body of Mucklewrath, over which his\r\nwife, in a revulsion of feeling, was weeping, howling, and tearing her\r\nelf-locks in a state little short of distraction. On raising up the\r\nsmith, the first discovery was that he was alive; and the next that he\r\nwas likely to live as long as if he had never heard the report of a\r\npistol in his life. He had made a narrow escape, however; the bullet\r\nhad grazed his head and stunned him for a moment or two, which trance\r\nterror and confusion of spirit had prolonged somewhat longer. He now\r\narose to demand vengeance on the person of Waverley, and with\r\ndifficulty acquiesced in the proposal of Mr. Morton that he should be\r\ncarried before the Laird, as a justice of peace, and placed at his\r\ndisposal. The rest of the assistants unanimously agreed to the measure\r\nrecommended; even Mrs. Mucklewrath, who had begun to recover from her\r\nhysterics, whimpered forth, “She wadna say naething against what the\r\nminister proposed; he was e’en ower gude for his trade, and she hoped\r\nto see him wi’ a dainty decent bishop’s gown on his back; a comelier\r\nsight than your Geneva cloaks and bands, I wis.”\r\n\r\nAll controversy being thus laid aside, Waverley, escorted by the whole\r\ninhabitants of the village who were not bed-ridden, was conducted to\r\nthe house of Cairnvreckan, which was about half a mile distant.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II.\r\nAN EXAMINATION\r\n\r\n\r\nMajor Melville of Cairnvreckan, an elderly gentleman, who had spent his\r\nyouth in the military service, received Mr. Morton with great kindness,\r\nand our hero with civility, which the equivocal circumstances wherein\r\nEdward was placed rendered constrained and distant.\r\n\r\nThe nature of the smith’s hurt was inquired into, and, as the actual\r\ninjury was likely to prove trifling, and the circumstances in which it\r\nwas received rendered the infliction on Edward’s part a natural act of\r\nself-defence, the Major conceived he might dismiss that matter on\r\nWaverley’s depositing in his hands a small sum for the benefit of the\r\nwounded person.\r\n\r\n“I could wish, sir,” continued the Major, “that my duty terminated\r\nhere; but it is necessary that we should have some further inquiry into\r\nthe cause of your journey through the country at this unfortunate and\r\ndistracted time.”\r\n\r\nMr. Ebenezer Cruickshanks now stood forth, and communicated to the\r\nmagistrate all he knew or suspected from the reserve of Waverley and\r\nthe evasions of Callum Beg. The horse upon which Edward rode, he said,\r\nhe knew to belong to Vich Ian Vohr, though he dared not tax Edward’s\r\nformer attendant with the fact, lest he should have his house and\r\nstables burnt over his head some night by that godless gang, the\r\nMac-Ivors. He concluded by exaggerating his own services to kirk and\r\nstate, as having been the means, under God (as he modestly qualified\r\nthe assertion), of attaching this suspicious and formidable delinquent.\r\nHe intimated hopes of future reward, and of instant reimbursement for\r\nloss of time, and even of character, by travelling on the state\r\nbusiness on the fast-day.\r\n\r\nTo this Major Melville answered, with great composure, that so far from\r\nclaiming any merit in this affair, Mr. Cruickshanks ought to deprecate\r\nthe imposition of a very heavy fine for neglecting to lodge, in terms\r\nof the recent proclamation, an account with the nearest magistrate of\r\nany stranger who came to his inn; that, as Mr. Cruickshanks boasted so\r\nmuch of religion and loyalty, he should not impute this conduct to\r\ndisaffection, but only suppose that his zeal for kirk and state had\r\nbeen lulled asleep by the opportunity of charging a stranger with\r\ndouble horse-hire; that, however, feeling himself incompetent to decide\r\nsingly upon the conduct of a person of such importance, he should\r\nreserve it for consideration of the next quarter-sessions. Now our\r\nhistory for the present saith no more of him of the Candlestick, who\r\nwended dolorous and malcontent back to his own dwelling.\r\n\r\nMajor Melville then commanded the villagers to return to their homes,\r\nexcepting two, who officiated as constables, and whom he directed to\r\nwait below. The apartment was thus cleared of every person but Mr.\r\nMorton, whom the Major invited to remain; a sort of factor, who acted\r\nas clerk; and Waverley himself. There ensued a painful and embarrassed\r\npause, till Major Melville, looking upon Waverley with much compassion,\r\nand often consulting a paper or memorandum which he held in his hand,\r\nrequested to know his name.\r\n\r\n“Edward Waverley.”\r\n\r\n“I thought so; late of the—dragoons, and nephew of Sir Everard Waverley\r\nof Waverley-Honour?”\r\n\r\n“The same.”\r\n\r\n“Young gentleman, I am extremely sorry that this painful duty has\r\nfallen to my lot.”\r\n\r\n“Duty, Major Melville, renders apologies superfluous.”\r\n\r\n“True, sir; permit me, therefore, to ask you how your time has been\r\ndisposed of since you obtained leave of absence from your regiment,\r\nseveral weeks ago, until the present moment?”\r\n\r\n“My reply,” said Waverley, “to so general a question must be guided by\r\nthe nature of the charge which renders it necessary. I request to know\r\nwhat that charge is, and upon what authority I am forcibly detained to\r\nreply to it?”\r\n\r\n“The charge, Mr. Waverley, I grieve to say, is of a very high nature,\r\nand affects your character both as a soldier and a subject. In the\r\nformer capacity you are charged with spreading mutiny and rebellion\r\namong the men you commanded, and setting them the example of desertion,\r\nby prolonging your own absence from the regiment, contrary to the\r\nexpress orders of your commanding officer. The civil crime of which you\r\nstand accused is that of high treason and levying war against the king,\r\nthe highest delinquency of which a subject can be guilty.”\r\n\r\n“And by what authority am I detained to reply to such heinous\r\ncalumnies?”\r\n\r\n“By one which you must not dispute, nor I disobey.”\r\n\r\nHe handed to Waverley a warrant from the Supreme Criminal Court of\r\nScotland, in full form, for apprehending and securing the person of\r\nEdward Waverley, Esq., suspected of treasonable practices and other\r\nhigh crimes and misdemeanours.\r\n\r\nThe astonishment which Waverley expressed at this communication was\r\nimputed by Major Melville to conscious guilt, while Mr. Morton was\r\nrather disposed to construe it into the surprise of innocence unjustly\r\nsuspected. There was something true in both conjectures; for although\r\nEdward’s mind acquitted him of the crime with which he was charged, yet\r\na hasty review of his own conduct convinced him he might have great\r\ndifficulty in establishing his innocence to the satisfaction of others.\r\n\r\n“It is a very painful part of this painful business,” said Major\r\nMelville, after a pause, “that, under so grave a charge, I must\r\nnecessarily request to see such papers as you have on your person.”\r\n\r\n“You shall, sir, without reserve,” said Edward, throwing his\r\npocket-book and memorandums upon the table; “there is but one with\r\nwhich I could wish you would dispense.”\r\n\r\n“I am afraid, Mr. Waverley, I can indulge you with no reservation,”\r\n\r\n“You shall see it then, sir; and as it can be of no service, I beg it\r\nmay be returned.”\r\n\r\nHe took from his bosom the lines he had that morning received, and\r\npresented them with the envelope. The Major perused them in silence,\r\nand directed his clerk to make a copy of them. He then wrapped the copy\r\nin the envelope, and placing it on the table before him, returned the\r\noriginal to Waverley, with an air of melancholy gravity.\r\n\r\nAfter indulging the prisoner, for such our hero must now be considered,\r\nwith what he thought a reasonable time for reflection, Major Melville\r\nresumed his examination, premising that, as Mr. Waverley seemed to\r\nobject to general questions, his interrogatories should be as specific\r\nas his information permitted. He then proceeded in his investigation,\r\ndictating, as he went on, the import of the questions and answers to\r\nthe amanuensis, by whom it was written down.\r\n\r\n“Did Mr. Waverley know one Humphry Houghton, a non-commissioned officer\r\nin Gardiner’s dragoons?”\r\n\r\n“Certainly; he was sergeant of my troop, and son of a tenant of my\r\nuncle.”\r\n\r\n“Exactly—and had a considerable share of your confidence, and an\r\ninfluence among his comrades?”\r\n\r\n“I had never occasion to repose confidence in a person of his\r\ndescription,” answered Waverley. “I favoured Sergeant Houghton as a\r\nclever, active young fellow, and I believe his fellow-soldiers\r\nrespected him accordingly.”\r\n\r\n“But you used through this man,” answered Major Melville, “to\r\ncommunicate with such of your troop as were recruited upon\r\nWaverley-Honour?”\r\n\r\n“Certainly; the poor fellows, finding themselves in a regiment chiefly\r\ncomposed of Scotch or Irish, looked up to me in any of their little\r\ndistresses, and naturally made their countryman and sergeant their\r\nspokesman on such occasions.”\r\n\r\n“Sergeant Houghton’s influence,” continued the Major, “extended, then,\r\nparticularly over those soldiers who followed you to the regiment from\r\nyour uncle’s estate?”\r\n\r\n“Surely; but what is that to the present purpose?”\r\n\r\n“To that I am just coming, and I beseech your candid reply. Have you,\r\nsince leaving the regiment, held any correspondence, direct or\r\nindirect, with this Sergeant Houghton?”\r\n\r\n“I!—I hold correspondence with a man of his rank and situation! How, or\r\nfor what purpose?”\r\n\r\n“That you are to explain. But did you not, for example, send to him for\r\nsome books?”\r\n\r\n“You remind me of a trifling commission,” said Waverley, “which I gave\r\nSergeant Houghton, because my servant could not read. I do recollect I\r\nbade him, by letter, select some books, of which I sent him a list, and\r\nsend them to me at Tully-Veolan.”\r\n\r\n“And of what description were those books?”\r\n\r\n“They related almost entirely to elegant literature; they were designed\r\nfor a lady’s perusal.”\r\n\r\n“Were there not, Mr. Waverley, treasonable tracts and pamphlets among\r\nthem?”\r\n\r\n“There were some political treatises, into which I hardly looked. They\r\nhad been sent to me by the officiousness of a kind friend, whose heart\r\nis more to be esteemed than his prudence or political sagacity; they\r\nseemed to be dull compositions.”\r\n\r\n“That friend,” continued the persevering inquirer, “was a Mr. Pembroke,\r\na nonjuring clergyman, the author of two treasonable works, of which\r\nthe manuscripts were found among your baggage?”\r\n\r\n“But of which, I give you my honour as a gentleman,” replied Waverley,\r\n“I never read six pages.”\r\n\r\n“I am not your judge, Mr. Waverley; your examination will be\r\ntransmitted elsewhere. And now to proceed. Do you know a person that\r\npasses by the name of Wily Will, or Will Ruthven?”\r\n\r\n“I never heard of such a name till this moment.”\r\n\r\n“Did you never through such a person, or any other person, communicate\r\nwith Sergeant Humphry Houghton, instigating him to desert, with as many\r\nof his comrades as he could seduce to join him, and unite with the\r\nHighlanders and other rebels now in arms under the command of the Young\r\nPretender?”\r\n\r\n“I assure you I am not only entirely guiltless of the plot you have\r\nlaid to my charge, but I detest it from the very bottom of my soul, nor\r\nwould I be guilty of such treachery to gain a throne, either for myself\r\nor any other man alive.”\r\n\r\n“Yet when I consider this envelope in the handwriting of one of those\r\nmisguided gentlemen who are now in arms against their country, and the\r\nverses which it enclosed, I cannot but find some analogy between the\r\nenterprise I have mentioned and the exploit of Wogan, which the writer\r\nseems to expect you should imitate.”\r\n\r\nWaverley was struck with the coincidence, but denied that the wishes or\r\nexpectations of the letter-writer were to be regarded as proofs of a\r\ncharge otherwise chimerical.\r\n\r\n“But, if I am rightly informed, your time was spent, during your\r\nabsence from the regiment, between the house of this Highland Chieftain\r\nand that of Mr. Bradwardine of Bradwardine, also in arms for this\r\nunfortunate cause?”\r\n\r\n“I do not mean to disguise it; but I do deny, most resolutely, being\r\nprivy to any of their designs against the government.”\r\n\r\n“You do not, however, I presume, intend to deny that you attended your\r\nhost Glennaquoich to a rendezvous, where, under a pretence of a general\r\nhunting match, most of the accomplices of his treason were assembled to\r\nconcert measures for taking arms?”\r\n\r\n“I acknowledge having been at such a meeting,” said Waverley; “but I\r\nneither heard nor saw anything which could give it the character you\r\naffix to it.”\r\n\r\n“From thence you proceeded,” continued the magistrate, “with\r\nGlennaquoich and a part of his clan to join the army of the Young\r\nPretender, and returned, after having paid your homage to him, to\r\ndiscipline and arm the remainder, and unite them to his bands on their\r\nway southward?”\r\n\r\n“I never went with Glennaquoich on such an errand. I never so much as\r\nheard that the person whom you mention was in the country.”\r\n\r\nHe then detailed the history of his misfortune at the hunting match,\r\nand added, that on his return he found himself suddenly deprived of his\r\ncommission, and did not deny that he then, for the first time, observed\r\nsymptoms which indicated a disposition in the Highlanders to take arms;\r\nbut added that, having no inclination to join their cause, and no\r\nlonger any reason for remaining in Scotland, he was now on his return\r\nto his native country, to which he had been summoned by those who had a\r\nright to direct his motions, as Major Melville would perceive from the\r\nletters on the table.\r\n\r\nMajor Melville accordingly perused the letters of Richard Waverley, of\r\nSir Everard, and of Aunt Rachel; but the inferences he drew from them\r\nwere different from what Waverley expected. They held the language of\r\ndiscontent with government, threw out no obscure hints of revenge, and\r\nthat of poor Aunt Rachel, which plainly asserted the justice of the\r\nStuart cause, was held to contain the open avowal of what the others\r\nonly ventured to insinuate.\r\n\r\n“Permit me another question, Mr. Waverley,” said Major Melville. “Did\r\nyou not receive repeated letters from your commanding officer, warning\r\nyou and commanding you to return to your post, and acquainting you with\r\nthe use made of your name to spread discontent among your soldiers?”\r\n\r\n“I never did, Major Melville. One letter, indeed, I received from him,\r\ncontaining a civil intimation of his wish that I would employ my leave\r\nof absence otherwise than in constant residence at Bradwardine, as to\r\nwhich, I own, I thought he was not called on to interfere; and,\r\nfinally, I received, on the same day on which I observed myself\r\nsuperseded in the “Gazette,” a second letter from Colonel Gardiner,\r\ncommanding me to join the regiment, an order which, owing to my\r\nabsence, already mentioned and accounted for, I received too late to be\r\nobeyed. If there were any intermediate letters, and certainly from the\r\nColonel’s high character I think it probable that there were, they have\r\nnever reached me.”\r\n\r\n“I have omitted, Mr. Waverley,” continued Major Melville, “to inquire\r\nafter a matter of less consequence, but which has nevertheless been\r\npublicly talked of to your disadvantage. It is said that a treasonable\r\ntoast having been proposed in your hearing and presence, you, holding\r\nhis Majesty’s commission, suffered the task of resenting it to devolve\r\nupon another gentleman of the company. This, sir, cannot be charged\r\nagainst you in a court of justice; but if, as I am informed, the\r\nofficers of your regiment requested an explanation of such a rumour, as\r\na gentleman and soldier I cannot but be surprised that you did not\r\nafford it to them.”\r\n\r\nThis was too much. Beset and pressed on every hand by accusations, in\r\nwhich gross falsehoods were blended with such circumstances of truth as\r\ncould not fail to procure them credit,—alone, unfriended, and in a\r\nstrange land, Waverley almost gave up his life and honour for lost,\r\nand, leaning his head upon his hand, resolutely refused to answer any\r\nfurther questions, since the fair and candid statement he had already\r\nmade had only served to furnish arms against him.\r\n\r\nWithout expressing either surprise or displeasure at the change in\r\nWaverley’s manner, Major Melville proceeded composedly to put several\r\nother queries to him.\r\n\r\n“What does it avail me to answer you?” said Edward sullenly. “You\r\nappear convinced of my guilt, and wrest every reply I have made to\r\nsupport your own preconceived opinion. Enjoy your supposed triumph,\r\nthen, and torment me no further. If I am capable of the cowardice and\r\ntreachery your charge burdens me with, I am not worthy to be believed\r\nin any reply I can make to you. If I am not deserving of your\r\nsuspicion—and God and my own conscience bear evidence with me that it\r\nis so—then I do not see why I should, by my candour, lend my accusers\r\narms against my innocence. There is no reason I should answer a word\r\nmore, and I am determined to abide by this resolution.”\r\n\r\nAnd again he resumed his posture of sullen and determined silence.\r\n\r\n“Allow me,” said the magistrate, “to remind you of one reason that may\r\nsuggest the propriety of a candid and open confession. The inexperience\r\nof youth, Mr. Waverley, lays it open to the plans of the more designing\r\nand artful; and one of your friends at least—I mean Mac-Ivor of\r\nGlennaquoich—ranks high in the latter class, as, from your apparent\r\ningenuousness, youth, and unacquaintance with the manners of the\r\nHighlands, I should be disposed to place you among the former. In such\r\na case, a false step or error like yours, which I shall be happy to\r\nconsider as involuntary, may be atoned for, and I would willingly act\r\nas intercessor. But, as you must necessarily be acquainted with the\r\nstrength of the individuals in this country who have assumed arms, with\r\ntheir means and with their plans, I must expect you will merit this\r\nmediation on my part by a frank and candid avowal of all that has come\r\nto your knowledge upon these heads; in which case, I think I can\r\nventure to promise that a very short personal restraint will be the\r\nonly ill consequence that can arise from your accession to these\r\nunhappy intrigues.”\r\n\r\nWaverley listened with great composure until the end of this\r\nexhortation, when, springing from his seat with an energy he had not\r\nyet displayed, he replied, “Major Melville, since that is your name, I\r\nhave hitherto answered your questions with candour, or declined them\r\nwith temper, because their import concerned myself alone; but, as you\r\npresume to esteem me mean enough to commence informer against others,\r\nwho received me, whatever may be their public misconduct, as a guest\r\nand friend, I declare to you that I consider your questions as an\r\ninsult infinitely more offensive than your calumnious suspicions; and\r\nthat, since my hard fortune permits me no other mode of resenting them\r\nthan by verbal defiance, you should sooner have my heart out of my\r\nbosom than a single syllable of information on subjects which I could\r\nonly become acquainted with in the full confidence of unsuspecting\r\nhospitality.”\r\n\r\nMr. Morton and the Major looked at each other; and the former, who, in\r\nthe course of the examination, had been repeatedly troubled with a\r\nsorry rheum, had recourse to his snuff-box and his handkerchief.\r\n\r\n“Mr. Waverley,” said the Major, “my present situation prohibits me\r\nalike from giving or receiving offence, and I will not protract a\r\ndiscussion which approaches to either. I am afraid I must sign a\r\nwarrant for detaining you in custody, but this house shall for the\r\npresent be your prison. I fear I cannot persuade you to accept a share\r\nof our supper?—(Edward shook his head)—but I will order refreshments in\r\nyour apartment.”\r\n\r\nOur hero bowed and withdrew, under guard of the officers of justice, to\r\na small but handsome room, where, declining all offers of food or wine,\r\nhe flung himself on the bed, and, stupified by the harassing events and\r\nmental fatigue of this miserable day, he sunk into a deep and heavy\r\nslumber. This was more than he himself could have expected; but it is\r\nmentioned of the North-American Indians, when at the stake of torture,\r\nthat on the least intermission of agony they will sleep until the fire\r\nis applied to awaken them.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III.\r\nA CONFERENCE AND THE CONSEQUENCE\r\n\r\n\r\nMajor Melville had detained Mr. Morton during his examination of\r\nWaverley, both because he thought he might derive assistance from his\r\npractical good sense and approved loyalty, and also because it was\r\nagreeable to have a witness of unimpeached candour and veracity to\r\nproceedings which touched the honour and safety of a young Englishman\r\nof high rank and family, and the expectant heir of a large fortune.\r\nEvery step he knew would be rigorously canvassed, and it was his\r\nbusiness to place the justice and integrity of his own conduct beyond\r\nthe limits of question.\r\n\r\nWhen Waverley retired, the laird and clergyman of Cairnvreckan sat down\r\nin silence to their evening meal. While the servants were in attendance\r\nneither chose to say anything on the circumstances which occupied their\r\nminds, and neither felt it easy to speak upon any other. The youth and\r\napparent frankness of Waverley stood in strong contrast to the shades\r\nof suspicion which darkened around him, and he had a sort of _naïveté_\r\nand openness of demeanour that seemed to belong to one unhackneyed in\r\nthe ways of intrigue, and which pleaded highly in his favour.\r\n\r\nEach mused over the particulars of the examination, and each viewed it\r\nthrough the medium of his own feelings. Both were men of ready and\r\nacute talent, and both were equally competent to combine various parts\r\nof evidence, and to deduce from them the necessary conclusions. But the\r\nwide difference of their habits and education often occasioned a great\r\ndiscrepancy in their respective deductions from admitted premises.\r\n\r\nMajor Melville had been versed in camps and cities; he was vigilant by\r\nprofession and cautious from experience, had met with much evil in the\r\nworld, and therefore, though himself an upright magistrate and an\r\nhonourable man, his opinions of others were always strict, and\r\nsometimes unjustly severe. Mr. Morton, on the contrary, had passed from\r\nthe literary pursuits of a college, where he was beloved by his\r\ncompanions and respected by his teachers, to the ease and simplicity of\r\nhis present charge, where his opportunities of witnessing evil were\r\nfew, and never dwelt upon but in order to encourage repentance and\r\namendment; and where the love and respect of his parishioners repaid\r\nhis affectionate zeal in their behalf by endeavouring to disguise from\r\nhim what they knew would give him the most acute pain, namely, their\r\nown occasional transgressions of the duties which it was the business\r\nof his life to recommend. Thus it was a common saying in the\r\nneighbourhood (though both were popular characters), that the laird\r\nknew only the ill in the parish and the minister only the good.\r\n\r\nA love of letters, though kept in subordination to his clerical studies\r\nand duties, also distinguished the pastor of Cairnvreckan, and had\r\ntinged his mind in earlier days with a slight feeling of romance, which\r\nno after incidents of real life had entirely dissipated. The early loss\r\nof an amiable young woman whom he had married for love, and who was\r\nquickly followed to the grave by an only child, had also served, even\r\nafter the lapse of many years, to soften a disposition naturally mild\r\nand contemplative. His feelings on the present occasion were therefore\r\nlikely to differ from those of the severe disciplinarian, strict\r\nmagistrate, and distrustful man of the world.\r\n\r\nWhen the servants had withdrawn, the silence of both parties continued,\r\nuntil Major Melville, filling his glass and pushing the bottle to Mr.\r\nMorton, commenced—\r\n\r\n“A distressing affair this, Mr. Morton. I fear this youngster has\r\nbrought himself within the compass of a halter.”\r\n\r\n“God forbid!” answered the clergyman.\r\n\r\n“Marry, and amen,” said the temporal magistrate; “but I think even your\r\nmerciful logic will hardly deny the conclusion.”\r\n\r\n“Surely, Major,” answered the clergyman, “I should hope it might be\r\naverted, for aught we have heard tonight?”\r\n\r\n“Indeed!” replied Melville. “But, my good parson, you are one of those\r\nwho would communicate to every criminal the benefit of clergy.”\r\n\r\n“Unquestionably I would. Mercy and long-suffering are the grounds of\r\nthe doctrine I am called to teach.”\r\n\r\n“True, religiously speaking; but mercy to a criminal may be gross\r\ninjustice to the community. I don’t speak of this young fellow in\r\nparticular, who I heartily wish may be able to clear himself, for I\r\nlike both his modesty and his spirit. But I fear he has rushed upon his\r\nfate.”\r\n\r\n“And why? Hundreds of misguided gentlemen are now in arms against the\r\ngovernment, many, doubtless, upon principles which education and early\r\nprejudice have gilded with the names of patriotism and heroism;\r\nJustice, when she selects her victims from such a multitude (for surely\r\nall will not be destroyed), must regard the moral motive. He whom\r\nambition or hope of personal advantage has led to disturb the peace of\r\na well-ordered government, let him fall a victim to the laws; but\r\nsurely youth, misled by the wild visions of chivalry and imaginary\r\nloyalty, may plead for pardon.”\r\n\r\n“If visionary chivalry and imaginary loyalty come within the\r\npredicament of high treason,” replied the magistrate, “I know no court\r\nin Christendom, my dear Mr. Morton, where they can sue out their Habeas\r\nCorpus.”\r\n\r\n“But I cannot see that this youth’s guilt is at all established to my\r\nsatisfaction,” said the clergyman.\r\n\r\n“Because your good-nature blinds your good sense,” replied Major\r\nMelville. “Observe now: This young man, descended of a family of\r\nhereditary Jacobites, his uncle the leader of the Tory interest in the\r\ncounty of ——, his father a disobliged and discontented courtier, his\r\ntutor a nonjuror and the author of two treasonable volumes—this youth,\r\nI say, enters into Gardiner’s dragoons, bringing with him a body of\r\nyoung fellows from his uncle’s estate, who have not stickled at avowing\r\nin their way the High-Church principles they learned at\r\nWaverley-Honour, in their disputes with their comrades. To these young\r\nmen Waverley is unusually attentive; they are supplied with money\r\nbeyond a soldier’s wants and inconsistent with his discipline; and are\r\nunder the management of a favourite sergeant, through whom they hold an\r\nunusually close communication with their captain, and affect to\r\nconsider themselves as independent of the other officers, and superior\r\nto their comrades.”\r\n\r\n“All this, my dear Major, is the natural consequence of their\r\nattachment to their young landlord, and of their finding themselves in\r\na regiment levied chiefly in the north of Ireland and the west of\r\nScotland, and of course among comrades disposed to quarrel with them,\r\nboth as Englishmen and as members of the Church of England.”\r\n\r\n“Well said, parson!” replied the magistrate. “I would some of your\r\nsynod heard you. But let me go on. This young man obtains leave of\r\nabsence, goes to Tully-Veolan—the principles of the Baron of\r\nBradwardine are pretty well known, not to mention that this lad’s uncle\r\nbrought him off in the year fifteen; he engages there in a brawl, in\r\nwhich he is said to have disgraced the commission he bore; Colonel\r\nGardiner writes to him, first mildly, then more sharply—I think you\r\nwill not doubt his having done so, since he says so; the mess invite\r\nhim to explain the quarrel in which he is said to have been involved;\r\nhe neither replies to his commander nor his comrades. In the meanwhile\r\nhis soldiers become mutinous and disorderly, and at length, when the\r\nrumour of this unhappy rebellion becomes general, his favourite\r\nSergeant Houghton and another fellow are detected in correspondence\r\nwith a French emissary, accredited, as he says, by Captain Waverley,\r\nwho urges him, according to the men’s confession, to desert with the\r\ntroop and join their captain, who was with Prince Charles. In the\r\nmeanwhile this trusty captain is, by his own admission, residing at\r\nGlennaquoich with the most active, subtle, and desperate Jacobite in\r\nScotland; he goes with him at least as far as their famous hunting\r\nrendezvous, and I fear a little farther. Meanwhile two other summonses\r\nare sent him; one warning him of the disturbances in his troop, another\r\nperemptorily ordering him to repair to the regiment, which, indeed,\r\ncommon sense might have dictated, when he observed rebellion thickening\r\nall round him. He returns an absolute refusal, and throws up his\r\ncommission.”\r\n\r\n“He had been already deprived of it,” said Mr. Morton.\r\n\r\n“But he regrets,” replied Melville, “that the measure had anticipated\r\nhis resignation. His baggage is seized at his quarters and at\r\nTully-Veolan, and is found to contain a stock of pestilent Jacobitical\r\npamphlets, enough to poison a whole country, besides the unprinted\r\nlucubrations of his worthy friend and tutor Mr. Pembroke.”\r\n\r\n“He says he never read them,” answered the minister.\r\n\r\n“In an ordinary case I should believe him,” replied the magistrate,\r\n“for they are as stupid and pedantic in composition as mischievous in\r\ntheir tenets. But can you suppose anything but value for the principles\r\nthey maintain would induce a young man of his age to lug such trash\r\nabout with him? Then, when news arrive of the approach of the rebels,\r\nhe sets out in a sort of disguise, refusing to tell his name; and, if\r\nyon old fanatic tell truth, attended by a very suspicious character,\r\nand mounted on a horse known to have belonged to Glennaquoich, and\r\nbearing on his person letters from his family expressing high rancour\r\nagainst the house of Brunswick, and a copy of verses in praise of one\r\nWogan, who abjured the service of the Parliament to join the Highland\r\ninsurgents, when in arms to restore the house of Stuart, with a body of\r\nEnglish cavalry—the very counterpart of his own plot—and summed up with\r\na “Go thou and do likewise” from that loyal subject, and most safe and\r\npeaceable character, Fergus Mac-Ivor of Glennaquoich, Vich Ian Vohr,\r\nand so forth. And, lastly,” continued Major Melville, warming in the\r\ndetail of his arguments, “where do we find this second edition of\r\nCavalier Wogan? Why, truly, in the very track most proper for execution\r\nof his design, and pistolling the first of the king’s subjects who\r\nventures to question his intentions.”\r\n\r\nMr. Morton prudently abstained from argument, which he perceived would\r\nonly harden the magistrate in his opinion, and merely asked how he\r\nintended to dispose of the prisoner?\r\n\r\n“It is a question of some difficulty, considering the state of the\r\ncountry,” said Major Melville.\r\n\r\n“Could you not detain him (being such a gentleman-like young man) here\r\nin your own house, out of harm’s way, till this storm blow over?”\r\n\r\n“My good friend,” said Major Melville, “neither your house nor mine\r\nwill be long out of harm’s way, even were it legal to confine him here.\r\nI have just learned that the commander-in-chief, who marched into the\r\nHighlands to seek out and disperse the insurgents, has declined giving\r\nthem battle at Coryarrick, and marched on northward with all the\r\ndisposable force of government to Inverness, John-o’-Groat’s House, or\r\nthe devil, for what I know, leaving the road to the Low Country open\r\nand undefended to the Highland army.”\r\n\r\n“Good God!” said the clergyman. “Is the man a coward, a traitor, or an\r\nidiot?”\r\n\r\n“None of the three, I believe,” answered Melville. “Sir John has the\r\ncommonplace courage of a common soldier, is honest enough, does what he\r\nis commanded, and understands what is told him, but is as fit to act\r\nfor himself in circumstances of importance as I, my dear parson, to\r\noccupy your pulpit.”\r\n\r\nThis important public intelligence naturally diverted the discourse\r\nfrom Waverley for some time; at length, however, the subject was\r\nresumed.\r\n\r\n“I believe,” said Major Melville, “that I must give this young man in\r\ncharge to some of the detached parties of armed volunteers who were\r\nlately sent out to overawe the disaffected districts. They are now\r\nrecalled towards Stirling, and a small body comes this way to-morrow or\r\nnext day, commanded by the westland man—what’s his name? You saw him,\r\nand said he was the very model of one of Cromwell’s military saints.”\r\n\r\n“Gilfillan, the Cameronian,” answered Mr. Morton. “I wish the young\r\ngentleman may be safe with him. Strange things are done in the heat and\r\nhurry of minds in so agitating a crisis, and I fear Gilfillan is of a\r\nsect which has suffered persecution without learning mercy.”\r\n\r\n“He has only to lodge Mr. Waverley in Stirling Castle,” said the Major;\r\n“I will give strict injunctions to treat him well. I really cannot\r\ndevise any better mode for securing him, and I fancy you would hardly\r\nadvise me to encounter the responsibility of setting him at liberty.”\r\n\r\n“But you will have no objection to my seeing him tomorrow in private?”\r\nsaid the minister.\r\n\r\n“None, certainly; your loyalty and character are my warrant. But with\r\nwhat view do you make the request?”\r\n\r\n“Simply,” replied Mr. Morton, “to make the experiment whether he may\r\nnot be brought to communicate to me some circumstances which may\r\nhereafter be useful to alleviate, if not to exculpate, his conduct.”\r\n\r\nThe friends now parted and retired to rest, each filled with the most\r\nanxious reflections on the state of the country.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IV.\r\nA CONFIDANT\r\n\r\n\r\nWaverley awoke in the morning from troubled dreams and unrefreshing\r\nslumbers to a full consciousness of the horrors of his situation. How\r\nit might terminate he knew not. He might be delivered up to military\r\nlaw, which, in the midst of civil war, was not likely to be scrupulous\r\nin the choice of its victims or the quality of the evidence. Nor did he\r\nfeel much more comfortable at the thoughts of a trial before a Scottish\r\ncourt of justice, where he knew the laws and forms differed in many\r\nrespects from those of England, and had been taught to believe, however\r\nerroneously, that the liberty and rights of the subject were less\r\ncarefully protected. A sentiment of bitterness rose in his mind against\r\nthe government, which he considered as the cause of his embarrassment\r\nand peril, and he cursed internally his scrupulous rejection of\r\nMac-Ivor’s invitation to accompany him to the field.\r\n\r\n“Why did not I,” he said to himself, “like other men of honour, take\r\nthe earliest opportunity to welcome to Britain the descendant of her\r\nancient kings and lineal heir of her throne? Why did not I—\r\n\r\nUnthread the rude eye of rebellion,\r\nAnd welcome home again discarded faith,\r\nSeek out Prince Charles, and fall before his feet?\r\n\r\n\r\nAll that has been recorded of excellence and worth in the house of\r\nWaverley has been founded upon their loyal faith to the house of\r\nStuart. From the interpretation which this Scotch magistrate has put\r\nupon the letters of my uncle and father, it is plain that I ought to\r\nhave understood them as marshalling me to the course of my ancestors;\r\nand it has been my gross dulness, joined to the obscurity of expression\r\nwhich they adopted for the sake of security, that has confounded my\r\njudgment. Had I yielded to the first generous impulse of indignation\r\nwhen I learned that my honour was practised upon, how different had\r\nbeen my present situation! I had then been free and in arms fighting,\r\nlike my forefathers, for love, for loyalty, and for fame. And now I am\r\nhere, netted and in the toils, at the disposal of a suspicious, stern,\r\nand cold-hearted man, perhaps to be turned over to the solitude of a\r\ndungeon or the infamy of a public execution. O, Fergus! how true has\r\nyour prophecy proved; and how speedy, how very speedy, has been its\r\naccomplishment!”\r\n\r\nWhile Edward was ruminating on these painful subjects of contemplation,\r\nand very naturally, though not quite so justly, bestowing upon the\r\nreigning dynasty that blame which was due to chance, or, in part at\r\nleast, to his own unreflecting conduct, Mr. Morton availed himself of\r\nMajor Melville’s permission to pay him an early visit.\r\n\r\nWaverley’s first impulse was to intimate a desire that he might not be\r\ndisturbed with questions or conversation; but he suppressed it upon\r\nobserving the benevolent and reverend appearance of the clergyman who\r\nhad rescued him from the immediate violence of the villagers.\r\n\r\n“I believe, sir,” said the unfortunate young man, “that in any other\r\ncircumstances I should have had as much gratitude to express to you as\r\nthe safety of my life may be worth; but such is the present tumult of\r\nmy mind, and such is my anticipation of what I am yet likely to endure,\r\nthat I can hardly offer you thanks for your interposition.”\r\n\r\nMr. Morton replied, that, far from making any claim upon his good\r\nopinion, his only wish and the sole purpose of his visit was to find\r\nout the means of deserving it. “My excellent friend, Major Melville,”\r\nhe continued, “has feelings and duties as a soldier and public\r\nfunctionary by which I am not fettered; nor can I always coincide in\r\nopinions which he forms, perhaps with too little allowance for the\r\nimperfections of human nature.” He paused and then proceeded: “I do not\r\nintrude myself on your confidence, Mr. Waverley, for the purpose of\r\nlearning any circumstances the knowledge of which can be prejudicial\r\neither to yourself or to others; but I own my earnest wish is that you\r\nwould intrust me with any particulars which could lead to your\r\nexculpation. I can solemnly assure you they will be deposited with a\r\nfaithful and, to the extent of his limited powers, a zealous agent.”\r\n\r\n“You are, sir, I presume, a Presbyterian clergyman?” Mr. Morton bowed.\r\n“Were I to be guided by the prepossessions of education, I might\r\ndistrust your friendly professions in my case; but I have observed that\r\nsimilar prejudices are nourished in this country against your\r\nprofessional brethren of the Episcopal persuasion, and I am willing to\r\nbelieve them equally unfounded in both cases.”\r\n\r\n“Evil to him that thinks otherwise,” said Mr. Morton; “or who holds\r\nchurch government and ceremonies as the exclusive gage of Christian\r\nfaith or moral virtue.”\r\n\r\n“But,” continued Waverley, “I cannot perceive why I should trouble you\r\nwith a detail of particulars, out of which, after revolving them as\r\ncarefully as possible in my recollection, I find myself unable to\r\nexplain much of what is charged against me. I know, indeed, that I am\r\ninnocent, but I hardly see how I can hope to prove myself so.”\r\n\r\n“It is for that very reason, Mr. Waverley,” said the clergyman, “that I\r\nventure to solicit your confidence. My knowledge of individuals in this\r\ncountry is pretty general, and can upon occasion be extended. Your\r\nsituation will, I fear, preclude your taking those active steps for\r\nrecovering intelligence or tracing imposture which I would willingly\r\nundertake in your behalf; and if you are not benefited by my exertions,\r\nat least they cannot be prejudicial to you.”\r\n\r\nWaverley, after a few minutes’ reflection, was convinced that his\r\nreposing confidence in Mr. Morton, so far as he himself was concerned,\r\ncould hurt neither Mr. Bradwardine nor Fergus Mac-Ivor, both of whom\r\nhad openly assumed arms against the government, and that it might\r\npossibly, if the professions of his new friend corresponded in\r\nsincerity with the earnestness of his expression, be of some service to\r\nhimself. He therefore ran briefly over most of the events with which\r\nthe reader is already acquainted, suppressing his attachment to Flora,\r\nand indeed neither mentioning her nor Rose Bradwardine in the course of\r\nhis narrative.\r\n\r\nMr. Morton seemed particularly struck with the account of Waverley’s\r\nvisit to Donald Bean Lean. “I am glad,” he said, “you did not mention\r\nthis circumstance to the Major. It is capable of great misconstruction\r\non the part of those who do not consider the power of curiosity and the\r\ninfluence of romance as motives of youthful conduct. When I was a young\r\nman like you, Mr. Waverley, any such hair-brained expedition (I beg\r\nyour pardon for the expression) would have had inexpressible charms for\r\nme. But there are men in the world who will not believe that danger and\r\nfatigue are often incurred without any very adequate cause, and\r\ntherefore who are sometimes led to assign motives of action entirely\r\nforeign to the truth. This man Bean Lean is renowned through the\r\ncountry as a sort of Robin Hood, and the stories which are told of his\r\naddress and enterprise are the common tales of the winter fireside. He\r\ncertainly possesses talents beyond the rude sphere in which he moves;\r\nand, being neither destitute of ambition nor encumbered with scruples,\r\nhe will probably attempt, by every means, to distinguish himself during\r\nthe period of these unhappy commotions.” Mr. Morton then made a careful\r\nmemorandum of the various particulars of Waverley’s interview with\r\nDonald Bean Lean and the other circumstances which he had communicated.\r\n\r\nThe interest which this good man seemed to take in his misfortunes,\r\nabove all, the full confidence he appeared to repose in his innocence,\r\nhad the natural effect of softening Edward’s heart, whom the coldness\r\nof Major Melville had taught to believe that the world was leagued to\r\noppress him. He shook Mr. Morton warmly by the hand, and, assuring him\r\nthat his kindness and sympathy had relieved his mind of a heavy load,\r\ntold him that, whatever might be his own fate, he belonged to a family\r\nwho had both gratitude and the power of displaying it. The earnestness\r\nof his thanks called drops to the eyes of the worthy clergyman, who was\r\ndoubly interested in the cause for which he had volunteered his\r\nservices, by observing the genuine and undissembled feelings of his\r\nyoung friend.\r\n\r\nEdward now inquired if Mr. Morton knew what was likely to be his\r\ndestination.\r\n\r\n“Stirling Castle,” replied his friend; “and so far I am well pleased\r\nfor your sake, for the governor is a man of honour and humanity. But I\r\nam more doubtful of your treatment upon the road; Major Melville is\r\ninvoluntarily obliged to intrust the custody of your person to\r\nanother.”\r\n\r\n“I am glad of it,” answered Waverley. “I detest that cold-blooded\r\ncalculating Scotch magistrate. I hope he and I shall never meet more.\r\nHe had neither sympathy with my innocence nor with my wretchedness; and\r\nthe petrifying accuracy with which he attended to every form of\r\ncivility, while he tortured me by his questions, his suspicions, and\r\nhis inferences, was as tormenting as the racks of the Inquisition. Do\r\nnot vindicate him, my dear sir, for that I cannot bear with patience;\r\ntell me rather who is to have the charge of so important a state\r\nprisoner as I am.”\r\n\r\n“I believe a person called Gilfillan, one of the sect who are termed\r\nCameronians.”\r\n\r\n“I never heard of them before.”\r\n\r\n“They claim,” said the clergyman, “to represent the more strict and\r\nsevere Presbyterians, who, in Charles Second’s and James Second’s days,\r\nrefused to profit by the Toleration, or Indulgence, as it was called,\r\nwhich was extended to others of that religion. They held conventicles\r\nin the open fields, and, being treated with great violence and cruelty\r\nby the Scottish government, more than once took arms during those\r\nreigns. They take their name from their leader, Richard Cameron.”\r\n\r\n“I recollect,” said Waverley; “but did not the triumph of Presbytery at\r\nthe Revolution extinguish that sect?”\r\n\r\n“By no means,” replied Morton; “that great event fell yet far short of\r\nwhat they proposed, which was nothing less than the complete\r\nestablishment of the Presbyterian Church upon the grounds of the old\r\nSolemn League and Covenant. Indeed, I believe they scarce knew what\r\nthey wanted; but being a numerous body of men, and not unacquainted\r\nwith the use of arms, they kept themselves together as a separate party\r\nin the state, and at the time of the Union had nearly formed a most\r\nunnatural league with their old enemies the Jacobites to oppose that\r\nimportant national measure. Since that time their numbers have\r\ngradually diminished; but a good many are still to be found in the\r\nwestern counties, and several, with a better temper than in 1707, have\r\nnow taken arms for government. This person, whom they call Gifted\r\nGilfillan, has been long a leader among them, and now heads a small\r\nparty, which will pass here to-day or to-morrow on their march towards\r\nStirling, under whose escort Major Melville proposes you shall travel.\r\nI would willingly speak to Gilfillan in your behalf; but, having deeply\r\nimbibed all the prejudices of his sect, and being of the same fierce\r\ndisposition, he would pay little regard to the remonstrances of an\r\nErastian divine, as he would politely term me. And now, farewell, my\r\nyoung friend; for the present I must not weary out the Major’s\r\nindulgence, that I may obtain his permission to visit you again in the\r\ncourse of the day.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER V.\r\nTHINGS MEND A LITTLE\r\n\r\n\r\nAbout noon Mr. Morton returned and brought an invitation from Major\r\nMelville that Mr. Waverley would honour him with his company to dinner,\r\nnotwithstanding the unpleasant affair which detained him at\r\nCairnvreckan, from which he should heartily rejoice to see Mr. Waverley\r\ncompletely extricated. The truth was that Mr. Morton’s favourable\r\nreport and opinion had somewhat staggered the preconceptions of the old\r\nsoldier concerning Edward’s supposed accession to the mutiny in the\r\nregiment; and in the unfortunate state of the country the mere\r\nsuspicion of disaffection or an inclination to join the insurgent\r\nJacobites might infer criminality indeed, but certainly not dishonour.\r\nBesides, a person whom the Major trusted had reported to him (though,\r\nas it proved, inaccurately) a contradiction of the agitating news of\r\nthe preceding evening. According to this second edition of the\r\nintelligence, the Highlanders had withdrawn from the Lowland frontier\r\nwith the purpose of following the army in their march to Inverness. The\r\nMajor was at a loss, indeed, to reconcile his information with the\r\nwell-known abilities of some of the gentlemen in the Highland army, yet\r\nit was the course which was likely to be most agreeable to others. He\r\nremembered the same policy had detained them in the north in the year\r\n1715, and he anticipated a similar termination to the insurrection as\r\nupon that occasion.\r\n\r\nThis news put him in such good-humour that he readily acquiesced in Mr.\r\nMorton’s proposal to pay some hospitable attention to his unfortunate\r\nguest, and voluntarily added, he hoped the whole affair would prove a\r\nyouthful escapade, which might be easily atoned by a short confinement.\r\nThe kind mediator had some trouble to prevail on his young friend to\r\naccept the invitation. He dared not urge to him the real motive, which\r\nwas a good-natured wish to secure a favourable report of Waverley’s\r\ncase from Major Melville to Governor Blakeney. He remarked, from the\r\nflashes of our hero’s spirit, that touching upon this topic would be\r\nsure to defeat his purpose. He therefore pleaded that the invitation\r\nargued the Major’s disbelief of any part of the accusation which was\r\ninconsistent with Waverley’s conduct as a soldier and a man of honour,\r\nand that to decline his courtesy might be interpreted into a\r\nconsciousness that it was unmerited. In short, he so far satisfied\r\nEdward that the manly and proper course was to meet the Major on easy\r\nterms that, suppressing his strong dislike again to encounter his cold\r\nand punctilious civility, Waverley agreed to be guided by his new\r\nfriend.\r\n\r\nThe meeting at first was stiff and formal enough. But Edward, having\r\naccepted the invitation, and his mind being really soothed and relieved\r\nby the kindness of Morton, held himself bound to behave with ease,\r\nthough he could not affect cordiality. The Major was somewhat of a bon\r\nvivant, and his wine was excellent. He told his old campaign stories,\r\nand displayed much knowledge of men and manners. Mr. Morton had an\r\ninternal fund of placid and quiet gaiety, which seldom failed to\r\nenliven any small party in which he found himself pleasantly seated.\r\nWaverley, whose life was a dream, gave ready way to the predominating\r\nimpulse and became the most lively of the party. He had at all times\r\nremarkable natural powers of conversation, though easily silenced by\r\ndiscouragement. On the present occasion he piqued himself upon leaving\r\non the minds of his companions a favourable impression of one who,\r\nunder such disastrous circumstances, could sustain his misfortunes with\r\nease and gaiety. His spirits, though not unyielding, were abundantly\r\nelastic, and soon seconded his efforts. The trio were engaged in very\r\nlively discourse, apparently delighted with each other, and the kind\r\nhost was pressing a third bottle of Burgundy, when the sound of a drum\r\nwas heard at some distance. The Major, who, in the glee of an old\r\nsoldier, had forgot the duties of a magistrate, cursed, with a muttered\r\nmilitary oath, the circumstances which recalled him to his official\r\nfunctions. He rose and went towards the window, which commanded a very\r\nnear view of the highroad, and he was followed by his guests.\r\n\r\nThe drum advanced, beating no measured martial tune, but a kind of\r\nrub-a-dub-dub, like that with which the fire-drum startles the\r\nslumbering artizans of a Scotch burgh. It is the object of this history\r\nto do justice to all men; I must therefore record, in justice to the\r\ndrummer, that he protested he could beat any known march or point of\r\nwar known in the British army, and had accordingly commenced with\r\n“Dumbarton’s Drums,” when he was silenced by Gifted Gilfillan, the\r\ncommander of the party, who refused to permit his followers to move to\r\nthis profane, and even, as he said, persecutive tune, and commanded the\r\ndrummer to beat the 119th Psalm. As this was beyond the capacity of the\r\ndrubber of sheepskin, he was fain to have recourse to the inoffensive\r\nrow-de-dow as a harmless substitute for the sacred music which his\r\ninstrument or skill were unable to achieve. This may be held a trifling\r\nanecdote, but the drummer in question was no less than town-drummer of\r\nAnderton. I remember his successor in office, a member of that\r\nenlightened body, the British Convention. Be his memory, therefore,\r\ntreated with due respect.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VI.\r\nA VOLUNTEER SIXTY YEARS SINCE\r\n\r\n\r\nOn hearing the unwelcome sound of the drum, Major Melville hastily\r\nopened a sashed door and stepped out upon a sort of terrace which\r\ndivided his house from the highroad from which the martial music\r\nproceeded. Waverley and his new friend followed him, though probably he\r\nwould have dispensed with their attendance. They soon recognised in\r\nsolemn march, first, the performer upon the drum; secondly, a large\r\nflag of four compartments, on which were inscribed the words, COVENANT,\r\nKIRK, KING, KINGDOMS. The person who was honoured with this charge was\r\nfollowed by the commander of the party, a thin, dark, rigid-looking\r\nman, about sixty years old. The spiritual pride, which in mine host of\r\nthe Candlestick mantled in a sort of supercilious hypocrisy, was in\r\nthis man’s face elevated and yet darkened by genuine and undoubting\r\nfanaticism. It was impossible to behold him without imagination placing\r\nhim in some strange crisis, where religious zeal was the ruling\r\nprinciple. A martyr at the stake, a soldier in the field, a lonely and\r\nbanished wanderer consoled by the intensity and supposed purity of his\r\nfaith under every earthly privation, perhaps a persecuting inquisitor,\r\nas terrific in power as unyielding in adversity; any of these seemed\r\ncongenial characters to this personage. With these high traits of\r\nenergy, there was something in the affected precision and solemnity of\r\nhis deportment and discourse that bordered upon the ludicrous; so that,\r\naccording to the mood of the spectator’s mind and the light under which\r\nMr. Gilfillan presented himself, one might have feared, admired, or\r\nlaughed at him. His dress was that of a West-Country peasant, of better\r\nmaterials indeed than that of the lower rank, but in no respect\r\naffecting either the mode of the age or of the Scottish gentry at any\r\nperiod. His arms were a broadsword and pistols, which, from the\r\nantiquity of their appearance, might have seen the rout of Pentland or\r\nBothwell Brigg.\r\n\r\nAs he came up a few steps to meet Major Melville, and touched solemnly,\r\nbut slightly, his huge and over-brimmed blue bonnet, in answer to the\r\nMajor, who had courteously raised a small triangular gold-laced hat,\r\nWaverley was irresistibly impressed with the idea that he beheld a\r\nleader of the Roundheads of yore in conference with one of\r\nMarlborough’s captains.\r\n\r\nThe group of about thirty armed men who followed this gifted commander\r\nwas of a motley description. They were in ordinary Lowland dresses, of\r\ndifferent colours, which, contrasted with the arms they bore, gave them\r\nan irregular and mobbish appearance; so much is the eye accustomed to\r\nconnect uniformity of dress with the military character. In front were\r\na few who apparently partook of their leader’s enthusiasm, men\r\nobviously to be feared in a combat, where their natural courage was\r\nexalted by religious zeal. Others puffed and strutted, filled with the\r\nimportance of carrying arms and all the novelty of their situation,\r\nwhile the rest, apparently fatigued with their march, dragged their\r\nlimbs listlessly along, or straggled from their companions to procure\r\nsuch refreshments as the neighbouring cottages and alehouses afforded.\r\nSix grenadiers of Ligonier’s, thought the Major to himself, as his mind\r\nreverted to his own military experience, would have sent all these\r\nfellows to the right about.\r\n\r\nGreeting, however, Mr. Gilfillan civilly, he requested to know if he\r\nhad received the letter he had sent to him upon his march, and could\r\nundertake the charge of the state prisoner whom he there mentioned as\r\nfar as Stirling Castle. “Yea,” was the concise reply of the Cameronian\r\nleader, in a voice which seemed to issue from the very _penetralia_ of\r\nhis person.\r\n\r\n“But your escort, Mr. Gilfillan, is not so strong as I expected,” said\r\nMajor Melville.\r\n\r\n“Some of the people,” replied Gilfillan, “hungered and were athirst by\r\nthe way, and tarried until their poor souls were refreshed with the\r\nword.”\r\n\r\n“I am sorry, sir,” replied the Major, “you did not trust to your\r\nrefreshing your men at Cairnvreckan; whatever my house contains is at\r\nthe command of persons employed in the service.”\r\n\r\n“It was not of creature-comforts I spake,” answered the Covenanter,\r\nregarding Major Melville with something like a smile of contempt;\r\n“howbeit, I thank you; but the people remained waiting upon the\r\nprecious Mr. Jabesh Rentowel for the out-pouring of the afternoon\r\nexhortation.”\r\n\r\n“And have you, sir,” said the Major, “when the rebels are about to\r\nspread themselves through this country, actually left a great part of\r\nyour command at a fieldpreaching?”\r\n\r\nGilfillan again smiled scornfully as he made this indirect answer—“Even\r\nthus are the children of this world wiser in their generation than the\r\nchildren of light!”\r\n\r\n“However, sir,” said the Major, “as you are to take charge of this\r\ngentleman to Stirling, and deliver him, with these papers, into the\r\nhands of Governor Blakeney, I beseech you to observe some rules of\r\nmilitary discipline upon your march. For example, I would advise you to\r\nkeep your men more closely together, and that each in his march should\r\ncover his file-leader, instead of straggling like geese upon a common;\r\nand, for fear of surprise, I further recommend to you to form a small\r\nadvance-party of your best men, with a single vidette in front of the\r\nwhole march, so that when you approach a village or a wood”—(here the\r\nMajor interrupted himself)—“But as I don’t observe you listen to me,\r\nMr. Gilfillan, I suppose I need not give myself the trouble to say more\r\nupon the subject. You are a better judge, unquestionably, than I am of\r\nthe measures to be pursued; but one thing I would have you well aware\r\nof, that you are to treat this gentleman, your prisoner, with no rigour\r\nnor incivility, and are to subject him to no other restraint than is\r\nnecessary for his security.”\r\n\r\n“I have looked into my commission,” said Mr. Gilfillan,” subscribed by\r\na worthy and professing nobleman, William, Earl of Glencairn; nor do I\r\nfind it therein set down that I am to receive any charges or commands\r\nanent my doings from Major William Melville of Cairnvreckan.”\r\n\r\nMajor Melville reddened even to the well-powdered ears which appeared\r\nbeneath his neat military sidecurls, the more so as he observed Mr.\r\nMorton smile at the same moment. “Mr. Gilfillan,” he answered, with\r\nsome asperity, “I beg ten thousand pardons for interfering with a\r\nperson of your importance. I thought, however, that as you have been\r\nbred a grazier, if I mistake not, there might be occasion to remind you\r\nof the difference between Highlanders and Highland cattle; and if you\r\nshould happen to meet with any gentleman who has seen service, and is\r\ndisposed to speak upon the subject, I should still imagine that\r\nlistening to him would do you no sort of harm. But I have done, and\r\nhave only once more to recommend this gentleman to your civility as\r\nwell as to your custody. Mr. Waverley, I am truly sorry we should part\r\nin this way; but I trust, when you are again in this country, I may\r\nhave an opportunity to render Cairnvreckan more agreeable than\r\ncircumstances have permitted on this occasion.”\r\n\r\nSo saying, he shook our hero by the hand. Morton also took an\r\naffectionate farewell, and Waverley, having mounted his horse, with a\r\nmusketeer leading it by the bridle and a file upon each side to prevent\r\nhis escape, set forward upon the march with Gilfillan and his party.\r\nThrough the little village they were accompanied with the shouts of the\r\nchildren, who cried out, “Eh! see to the Southland gentleman that’s\r\ngaun to be hanged for shooting lang John Mucklewrath, the smith!”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VII.\r\nAN INCIDENT\r\n\r\n\r\nThe dinner hour of Scotland Sixty Years Since was two o’clock. It was\r\ntherefore about four o’clock of a delightful autumn afternoon that Mr.\r\nGilfillan commenced his march, in hopes, although Stirling was eighteen\r\nmiles distant, he might be able, by becoming a borrower of the night\r\nfor an hour or two, to reach it that evening. He therefore put forth\r\nhis strength, and marched stoutly along at the head of his followers,\r\neyeing our hero from time to time, as if he longed to enter into\r\ncontroversy with him. At length, unable to resist the temptation, he\r\nslackened his pace till he was alongside of his prisoner’s horse, and\r\nafter marching a few steps in silence abreast of him, he suddenly\r\nasked—“Can ye say wha the carle was wi’ the black coat and the mousted\r\nhead, that was wi’ the Laird of Cairnvreckan?”\r\n\r\n“A Presbyterian clergyman,” answered Waverley.\r\n\r\n“Presbyterian!” answered Gilfillan contemptuously; “a wretched\r\nErastian, or rather an obscure Prelatist, a favourer of the black\r\nindulgence, ane of thae dumb dogs that canna bark; they tell ower a\r\nclash o’ terror and a clatter o’ comfort in their sermons, without ony\r\nsense, or savour, or life. Ye’ve been fed in siccan a fauld, belike?”\r\n\r\n“No; I am of the Church of England,” said Waverley.\r\n\r\n“And they’re just neighbour-like,” replied the Covenanter; “and nae\r\nwonder they gree sae weel. Wha wad hae thought the goodly structure of\r\nthe Kirk of Scotland, built up by our fathers in 1642, wad hae been\r\ndefaced by carnal ends and the corruptions of the time;—ay, wha wad hae\r\nthought the carved work of the sanctuary would hae been sae soon cut\r\ndown!”\r\n\r\nTo this lamentation, which one or two of the assistants chorussed with\r\na deep groan, our hero thought it unnecessary to make any reply.\r\nWhereupon Mr. Gilfillan, resolving that he should be a hearer at least,\r\nif not a disputant, proceeded in his Jeremiade.\r\n\r\n“And now is it wonderful, when, for lack of exercise anent the call to\r\nthe service of the altar and the duty of the day, ministers fall into\r\nsinful compliances with patronage, and indemnities, and oaths, and\r\nbonds, and other corruptions,—is it wonderful, I say, that you, sir,\r\nand other sic-like unhappy persons, should labour to build up your auld\r\nBabel of iniquity, as in the bluidy persecuting saint-killing times? I\r\ntrow, gin ye werena blinded wi’ the graces and favours, and services\r\nand enjoyments, and employments and inheritances, of this wicked world,\r\nI could prove to you, by the Scripture, in what a filthy rag ye put\r\nyour trust; and that your surplices, and your copes and vestments, are\r\nbut cast-off garments of the muckle harlot that sitteth upon seven\r\nhills and drinketh of the cup of abomination. But, I trow, ye are deaf\r\nas adders upon that side of the head; ay, ye are deceived with her\r\nenchantments, and ye traffic with her merchandise, and ye are drunk\r\nwith the cup of her fornication!”\r\n\r\nHow much longer this military theologist might have continued his\r\ninvective, in which he spared nobody but the scattered remnant of\r\n_hill-folk_, as he called them, is absolutely uncertain. His matter was\r\ncopious, his voice powerful, and his memory strong; so that there was\r\nlittle chance of his ending his exhortation till the party had reached\r\nStirling, had not his attention been attracted by a pedlar who had\r\njoined the march from a cross-road, and who sighed or groaned with\r\ngreat regularity at all fitting pauses of his homily.\r\n\r\n“And what may ye be, friend?” said the Gifted Gilfillan.\r\n\r\n“A puir pedlar, that’s bound for Stirling, and craves the protection of\r\nyour honour’s party in these kittle times. Ah, your honour has a\r\nnotable faculty in searching and explaining the secret,—ay, the secret\r\nand obscure and incomprehensible causes of the backslidings of the\r\nland; ay, your honour touches the root o’ the matter.”\r\n\r\n“Friend,” said Gilfillan, with a more complacent voice than he had\r\nhitherto used, “honour not me. I do not go out to park-dikes and to\r\nsteadings and to market-towns to have herds and cottars and burghers\r\npull off their bonnets to me as they do to Major Melville o’\r\nCairnvreckan, and ca’ me laird or captain or honour. No; my sma’ means,\r\nwhilk are not aboon twenty thousand merk, have had the blessing of\r\nincrease, but the pride of my heart has not increased with them; nor do\r\nI delight to be called captain, though I have the subscribed commission\r\nof that gospel-searching nobleman, the Earl of Glencairn, fa whilk I am\r\nso designated. While I live I am and will be called Habakkuk Gilfillan,\r\nwho will stand up for the standards of doctrine agreed on by the ance\r\nfamous Kirk of Scotland, before she trafficked with the accursed Achan,\r\nwhile he has a plack in his purse or a drap o’ bluid in his body.”\r\n\r\n“Ah,” said the pedlar, “I have seen your land about Mauchlin. A fertile\r\nspot! your lines have fallen in pleasant places! And siccan a breed o’\r\ncattle is not in ony laird’s land in Scotland.”\r\n\r\n“Ye say right,—ye say right, friend” retorted Gilfillan eagerly, for he\r\nwas not inaccessible to flattery upon this subject,—“ye say right; they\r\nare the real Lancashire, and there’s no the like o’ them even at the\r\nmains of Kilmaurs”; and he then entered into a discussion of their\r\nexcellences, to which our readers will probably be as indifferent as\r\nour hero. After this excursion the leader returned to his theological\r\ndiscussions, while the pedlar, less profound upon those mystic points,\r\ncontented himself with groaning and expressing his edification at\r\nsuitable intervals.\r\n\r\n“What a blessing it would be to the puir blinded popish nations among\r\nwhom I hae sojourned, to have siccan a light to their paths! I hae been\r\nas far as Muscovia in my sma’ trading way, as a travelling merchant,\r\nand I hae been through France, and the Low Countries, and a’ Poland,\r\nand maist feck o’ Germany, and O! it would grieve your honour’s soul to\r\nsee the murmuring and the singing and massing that’s in the kirk, and\r\nthe piping that’s in the quire, and the heathenish dancing and dicing\r\nupon the Sabbath!”\r\n\r\nThis set Gilfillan off upon the Book of Sports and the Covenant, and\r\nthe Engagers, and the Protesters, and the Whiggamore’s Raid, and the\r\nAssembly of Divines at Westminster, and the Longer and Shorter\r\nCatechism, and the Excommunication at Torwood, and the slaughter of\r\nArchbishop Sharp. This last topic, again, led him into the lawfulness\r\nof defensive arms, on which subject he uttered much more sense than\r\ncould have been expected from some other parts of his harangue, and\r\nattracted even Waverley’s attention, who had hitherto been lost in his\r\nown sad reflections. Mr. Gilfillan then considered the lawfulness of a\r\nprivate man’s standing forth as the avenger of public oppression, and\r\nas he was labouring with great earnestness the cause of Mas James\r\nMitchell, who fired at the Archbishop of Saint Andrews some years\r\nbefore the prelate’s assassination on Magus Muir, an incident occurred\r\nwhich interrupted his harangue.\r\n\r\nThe rays of the sun were lingering on the very verge of the horizon as\r\nthe party ascended a hollow and somewhat steep path which led to the\r\nsummit of a rising ground. The country was uninclosed, being part of a\r\nvery extensive heath or common; but it was far from level, exhibiting\r\nin many places hollows filled with furze and broom; in others, little\r\ndingles of stunted brushwood. A thicket of the latter description\r\ncrowned the hill up which the party ascended. The foremost of the band,\r\nbeing the stoutest and most active, had pushed on, and, having\r\nsurmounted the ascent, were out of ken for the present. Gilfillan, with\r\nthe pedlar and the small party who were Waverley’s more immediate\r\nguard, were near the top of the ascent, and the remainder straggled\r\nafter them at a considerable interval.\r\n\r\nSuch was the situation of matters when the pedlar, missing, as he said,\r\na little doggie which belonged to him, began to halt and whistle for\r\nthe animal. This signal, repeated more than once, gave offence to the\r\nrigour of his companion, the rather because it appeared to indicate\r\ninattention to the treasures of theological and controversial knowledge\r\nwhich were pouring out for his edification. He therefore signified\r\ngruffly that he could not waste his time in waiting for an useless cur.\r\n\r\n“But if your honour wad consider the case of Tobit—”\r\n\r\n“Tobit!” exclaimed Gilffflan, with great heat; “Tobit and his dog baith\r\nare altogether heathenish and apocryphal, and none but a prelatist or a\r\npapist would draw them into question. I doubt I hae been mista’en in\r\nyou, friend.”\r\n\r\n“Very likely,” answered the pedlar, with great composure; “but\r\nne’ertheless, I shall take leave to whistle again upon puir Bawty.”\r\n\r\nThis last signal was answered in an unexpected manner; for six or eight\r\nstout Highlanders, who lurked among the copse and brushwood, sprung\r\ninto the hollow way and began to lay about them with their claymores.\r\nGilfillan, unappalled at this undesirable apparition, cried out\r\nmanfully, “The sword of the Lord and of Gideon!” and, drawing his\r\nbroadsword, would probably have done as much credit to the good old\r\ncause as any of its doughty champions at Drumclog, when, behold! the\r\npedlar, snatching a musket from the person who was next him bestowed\r\nthe butt of it with such emphasis on the head of his late instructor in\r\nthe Cameronian creed that he was forthwith levelled to the ground. In\r\nthe confusion which ensued the horse which bore our hero was shot by\r\none of Gilfillan’s party, as he discharged his firelock at random.\r\nWaverley fell with, and indeed under, the animal, and sustained some\r\nsevere contusions. But he was almost instantly extricated from the\r\nfallen steed by two Highlanders, who, each seizing him by the arm,\r\nhurried him away from the scuffle and from the highroad. They ran with\r\ngreat speed, half supporting and half dragging our hero, who could,\r\nhowever, distinguish a few dropping shots fired about the spot which he\r\nhad left. This, as he afterwards learned, proceeded from Gilfillan’s\r\nparty, who had now assembled, the stragglers in front and rear having\r\njoined the others. At their approach the Highlanders drew off, but not\r\nbefore they had rifled Gilfillan and two of his people, who remained on\r\nthe spot grievously wounded. A few shots were exchanged betwixt them\r\nand the Westlanders; but the latter, now without a commander, and\r\napprehensive of a second ambush, did not make any serious effort to\r\nrecover their prisoner, judging it more wise to proceed on their\r\njourney to Stirling, carrying with them their wounded captain and\r\ncomrades.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VIII.\r\nWAVERLEY IS STILL IN DISTRESS\r\n\r\n\r\nThe velocity, and indeed violence, with which Waverley was hurried\r\nalong nearly deprived him of sensation; for the injury he had received\r\nfrom his fall prevented him from aiding himself so effectually as he\r\nmight otherwise have done. When this was observed by his conductors,\r\nthey called to their aid two or three others of the party, and,\r\nswathing our hero’s body in one of their plaids, divided his weight by\r\nthat means among them, and transported him at the same rapid rate as\r\nbefore, without any exertion of his own. They spoke little, and that in\r\nGaelic; and did not slacken their pace till they had run nearly two\r\nmiles, when they abated their extreme rapidity, but continued still to\r\nwalk very fast, relieving each other occasionally.\r\n\r\nOur hero now endeavoured to address them, but was only answered with\r\n“Cha n’eil Beurl agam” _i.e._ “I have no English,” being, as Waverley\r\nwell knew, the constant reply of a Highlander when he either does not\r\nunderstand or does not choose to reply to an Englishman or Lowlander.\r\nHe then mentioned the name of Vich Ian Vohr, concluding that he was\r\nindebted to his friendship for his rescue from the clutches of Gifted\r\nGilfillan, but neither did this produce any mark of recognition from\r\nhis escort.\r\n\r\nThe twilight had given place to moonshine when the party halted upon\r\nthe brink of a precipitous glen, which, as partly enlightened by the\r\nmoonbeams, seemed full of trees and tangled brushwood. Two of the\r\nHighlanders dived into it by a small foot-path, as if to explore its\r\nrecesses, and one of them returning in a few minutes, said something to\r\nhis companions, who instantly raised their burden and bore him, with\r\ngreat attention and care, down the narrow and abrupt descent.\r\nNotwithstanding their precautions, however, Waverley’s person came more\r\nthan once into contact, rudely enough, with the projecting stumps and\r\nbranches which overhung the pathway.\r\n\r\nAt the bottom of the descent, and, as it seemed, by the side of a brook\r\n(for Waverley heard the rushing of a considerable body of water,\r\nalthough its stream was invisible in the darkness), the party again\r\nstopped before a small and rudely-constructed hovel. The door was open,\r\nand the inside of the premises appeared as uncomfortable and rude as\r\nits situation and exterior foreboded. There was no appearance of a\r\nfloor of any kind; the roof seemed rent in several places; the walls\r\nwere composed of loose stones and turf, and the thatch of branches of\r\ntrees. The fire was in the centre, and filled the whole wigwam with\r\nsmoke, which escaped as much through the door as by means of a circular\r\naperture in the roof. An old Highland sibyl, the only inhabitant of\r\nthis forlorn mansion, appeared busy in the preparation of some food. By\r\nthe light which the fire afforded Waverley could discover that his\r\nattendants were not of the clan of Ivor, for Fergus was particularly\r\nstrict in requiring from his followers that they should wear the tartan\r\nstriped in the mode peculiar to their race; a mark of distinction\r\nanciently general through the Highlands, and still maintained by those\r\nChiefs who were proud of their lineage or jealous of their separate and\r\nexclusive authority.\r\n\r\nEdward had lived at Glennaquoich long enough to be aware of a\r\ndistinction which he had repeatedly heard noticed, and now satisfied\r\nthat he had no interest with his attendants, he glanced a disconsolate\r\neye around the interior of the cabin. The only furniture, excepting a\r\nwashing-tub and a wooden press, called in Scotland an ambry, sorely\r\ndecayed, was a large wooden bed, planked, as is usual, all around, and\r\nopening by a sliding panel. In this recess the Highlanders deposited\r\nWaverley, after he had by signs declined any refreshment. His slumbers\r\nwere broken and unrefreshing; strange visions passed before his eyes,\r\nand it required constant and reiterated efforts of mind to dispel them.\r\nShivering, violent headache, and shooting pains in his limbs succeeded\r\nthese symptoms; and in the morning it was evident to his Highland\r\nattendants or guard, for he knew not in which light to consider them,\r\nthat Waverley was quite unfit to travel.\r\n\r\nAfter a long consultation among themselves, six of the party left the\r\nhut with their arms, leaving behind an old and a young man. The former\r\naddressed Waverley, and bathed the contusions, which swelling and livid\r\ncolour now made conspicuous. His own portmanteau, which the Highlanders\r\nhad not failed to bring off, supplied him with linen, and to his great\r\nsurprise was, with all its undiminished contents, freely resigned to\r\nhis use. The bedding of his couch seemed clean and comfortable, and his\r\naged attendant closed the door of the bed, for it had no curtain, after\r\na few words of Gaelic, from which Waverley gathered that he exhorted\r\nhim to repose. So behold our hero for a second time the patient of a\r\nHighland Esculapius, but in a situation much more uncomfortable than\r\nwhen he was the guest of the worthy Tomanrait.\r\n\r\nThe symptomatic fever which accompanied the injuries he had sustained\r\ndid not abate till the third day, when it gave way to the care of his\r\nattendants and the strength of his constitution, and he could now raise\r\nhimself in his bed, though not without pain. He observed, however, that\r\nthere was a great disinclination on the part of the old woman who acted\r\nas his nurse, as well as on that of the elderly Highlander, to permit\r\nthe door of the bed to be left open, so that he might amuse himself\r\nwith observing their motions; and at length, after Waverley had\r\nrepeatedly drawn open and they had as frequently shut the hatchway of\r\nhis cage, the old gentleman put an end to the contest by securing it on\r\nthe outside with a nail so effectually that the door could not be drawn\r\ntill this exterior impediment was removed.\r\n\r\nWhile musing upon the cause of this contradictory spirit in persons\r\nwhose conduct intimated no purpose of plunder, and who, in all other\r\npoints, appeared to consult his welfare and his wishes, it occurred to\r\nour hero that, during the worst crisis of his illness, a female figure,\r\nyounger than his old Highland nurse, had appeared to flit around his\r\ncouch. Of this, indeed, he had but a very indistinct recollection, but\r\nhis suspicions were confirmed when, attentively listening, he often\r\nheard, in the course of the day, the voice of another female conversing\r\nin whispers with his attendant. Who could it be? And why should she\r\napparently desire concealment? Fancy immediately aroused herself and\r\nturned to Flora Mac-Ivor. But after a short conflict between his eager\r\ndesire to believe she was in his neighbourhood, guarding, like an angel\r\nof mercy, the couch of his sickness, Waverley was compelled to conclude\r\nthat his conjecture was altogether improbable; since, to suppose she\r\nhad left her comparatively safe situation at Glennaquoich to descend\r\ninto the Low Country, now the seat of civil war, and to inhabit such a\r\nlurking-place as this, was a thing hardly to be imagined. Yet his heart\r\nbounded as he sometimes could distinctly hear the trip of a light\r\nfemale step glide to or from the door of the hut, or the suppressed\r\nsounds of a female voice, of softness and delicacy, hold dialogue with\r\nthe hoarse inward croak of old Janet, for so he understood his\r\nantiquated attendant was denominated.\r\n\r\nHaving nothing else to amuse his solitude, he employed himself in\r\ncontriving some plan to gratify his curiosity, in despite of the\r\nsedulous caution of Janet and the old Highland janizary, for he had\r\nnever seen the young fellow since the first morning. At length, upon\r\naccurate examination, the infirm state of his wooden prison-house\r\nappeared to supply the means of gratifying his curiosity, for out of a\r\nspot which was somewhat decayed he was able to extract a nail. Through\r\nthis minute aperture he could perceive a female form, wrapped in a\r\nplaid, in the act of conversing with Janet. But, since the days of our\r\ngrandmother Eve, the gratification of inordinate curiosity has\r\ngenerally borne its penalty in disappointment. The form was not that of\r\nFlora, nor was the face visible; and, to crown his vexation, while he\r\nlaboured with the nail to enlarge the hole, that he might obtain a more\r\ncomplete view, a slight noise betrayed his purpose, and the object of\r\nhis curiosity instantly disappeared, nor, so far as he could observe,\r\ndid she again revisit the cottage.\r\n\r\nAll precautions to blockade his view were from that time abandoned, and\r\nhe was not only permitted but assisted to rise, and quit what had been,\r\nin a literal sense, his couch of confinement. But he was not allowed to\r\nleave the hut; for the young Highlander had now rejoined his senior,\r\nand one or other was constantly on the watch. Whenever Waverley\r\napproached the cottage door the sentinel upon duty civilly, but\r\nresolutely, placed himself against it and opposed his exit,\r\naccompanying his action with signs which seemed to imply there was\r\ndanger in the attempt and an enemy in the neighbourhood. Old Janet\r\nappeared anxious and upon the watch; and Waverley, who had not yet\r\nrecovered strength enough to attempt to take his departure in spite of\r\nthe opposition of his hosts, was under the necessity of remaining\r\npatient. His fare was, in every point of view, better than he could\r\nhave conceived, for poultry, and even wine, were no strangers to his\r\ntable. The Highlanders never presumed to eat with him, and, unless in\r\nthe circumstance of watching him, treated him with great respect. His\r\nsole amusement was gazing from the window, or rather the shapeless\r\naperture which was meant to answer the purpose of a window, upon a\r\nlarge and rough brook, which raged and foamed through a rocky channel,\r\nclosely canopied with trees and bushes, about ten feet beneath the site\r\nof his house of captivity.\r\n\r\nUpon the sixth day of his confinement Waverley found himself so well\r\nthat he began to meditate his escape from this dull and miserable\r\nprison-house, thinking any risk which he might incur in the attempt\r\npreferable to the stupefying and intolerable uniformity of Janet’s\r\nretirement. The question indeed occurred, whither he was to direct his\r\ncourse when again at his own disposal. Two schemes seemed practicable,\r\nyet both attended with danger and difficulty. One was to go back to\r\nGlennaquoich and join Fergus Mac-Ivor, by whom he was sure to be kindly\r\nreceived; and in the present state of his mind, the rigour with which\r\nhe had been treated fully absolved him, in his own eyes, from his\r\nallegiance to the existing government. The other project was to\r\nendeavour to attain a Scottish seaport, and thence to take shipping for\r\nEngland. His mind wavered between these plans, and probably, if he had\r\neffected his escape in the manner he proposed, he would have been\r\nfinally determined by the comparative facility by which either might\r\nhave been executed. But his fortune had settled that he was not to be\r\nleft to his option.\r\n\r\nUpon the evening of the seventh day the door of the hut suddenly\r\nopened, and two Highlanders entered, whom Waverley recognised as having\r\nbeen a part of his original escort to this cottage. They conversed for\r\na short time with the old man and his companion, and then made Waverley\r\nunderstand, by very significant signs, that he was to prepare to\r\naccompany them. This was a joyful communication. What had already\r\npassed during his confinement made it evident that no personal injury\r\nwas designed to him; and his romantic spirit, having recovered during\r\nhis repose much of that elasticity which anxiety, resentment,\r\ndisappointment, and the mixture of unpleasant feelings excited by his\r\nlate adventures had for a time subjugated, was now wearied with\r\ninaction. His passion for the wonderful, although it is the nature of\r\nsuch dispositions to be excited by that degree of danger which merely\r\ngives dignity to the feeling of the individual exposed to it, had sunk\r\nunder the extraordinary and apparently insurmountable evils by which he\r\nappeared environed at Cairnvreckan. In fact, this compound of intense\r\ncuriosity and exalted imagination forms a peculiar species of courage,\r\nwhich somewhat resembles the light usually carried by a\r\nminer—sufficiently competent, indeed, to afford him guidance and\r\ncomfort during the ordinary perils of his labour, but certain to be\r\nextinguished should he encounter the more formidable hazard of earth\r\ndamps or pestiferous vapours. It was now, however, once more rekindled,\r\nand with a throbbing mixture of hope, awe, and anxiety, Waverley\r\nwatched the group before him, as those who were just arrived snatched a\r\nhasty meal, and the others assumed their arms and made brief\r\npreparations for their departure.\r\n\r\nAs he sat in the smoky hut, at some distance from the fire, around\r\nwhich the others were crowded, he felt a gentle pressure upon his arm.\r\nHe looked round; it was Alice, the daughter of Donald Bean Lean. She\r\nshowed him a packet of papers in such a manner that the motion was\r\nremarked by no one else, put her finger for a second to her lips, and\r\npassed on, as if to assist old Janet in packing Waverley’s clothes in\r\nhis portmanteau. It was obviously her wish that he should not seem to\r\nrecognise her, yet she repeatedly looked back at him, as an opportunity\r\noccurred of doing so unobserved, and when she saw that he remarked what\r\nshe did, she folded the packet with great address and speed in one of\r\nhis shirts, which she deposited in the portmanteau.\r\n\r\nHere then was fresh food for conjecture. Was Alice his unknown warden,\r\nand was this maiden of the cavern the tutelar genius that watched his\r\nbed during his sickness? Was he in the hands of her father? and if so,\r\nwhat was his purpose? Spoil, his usual object, seemed in this case\r\nneglected; for not only Waverley’s property was restored, but his\r\npurse, which might have tempted this professional plunderer, had been\r\nall along suffered to remain in his possession. All this perhaps the\r\npacket might explain; but it was plain from Alice’s manner that she\r\ndesired he should consult it in secret. Nor did she again seek his eye\r\nafter she had satisfied herself that her manœuvre was observed and\r\nunderstood. On the contrary, she shortly afterwards left the hut, and\r\nit was only as she tripped out from the door, that, favoured by the\r\nobscurity, she gave Waverley a parting smile and nod of significance\r\nere she vanished in the dark glen.\r\n\r\nThe young Highlander was repeatedly despatched by his comrades as if to\r\ncollect intelligence. At length, when he had returned for the third or\r\nfourth time, the whole party arose and made signs to our hero to\r\naccompany them. Before his departure, however, he shook hands with old\r\nJanet, who had been so sedulous in his behalf, and added substantial\r\nmarks of his gratitude for her attendance.\r\n\r\n“God bless you! God prosper you, Captain Waverley!” said Janet, in good\r\nLowland Scotch, though he had never hithero heard her utter a syllable,\r\nsave in Gaelic. But the impatience of his attendants prohibited his\r\nasking any explanation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IX.\r\nA NOCTURNAL ADVENTURE\r\n\r\n\r\nThere was a moment’s pause when the whole party had got out of the hut;\r\nand the Highlander who assumed the command, and who, in Waverley’s\r\nawakened recollection, seemed to be the same tall figure who had acted\r\nas Donald Bean Lean’s lieutenant, by whispers and signs imposed the\r\nstrictest silence. He delivered to Edward a sword and steel pistol,\r\nand, pointing up the track, laid his hand on the hilt of his own\r\nclaymore, as if to make him sensible they might have occasion to use\r\nforce to make good their passage. He then placed himself at the head of\r\nthe party, who moved up the pathway in single or Indian file, Waverley\r\nbeing placed nearest to their leader. He moved with great precaution,\r\nas if to avoid giving any alarm, and halted as soon as he came to the\r\nverge of the ascent. Waverley was soon sensible of the reason, for he\r\nheard at no great distance an English sentinel call out “All’s well.”\r\nThe heavy sound sunk on the night-wind down the woody glen, and was\r\nanswered by the echoes of its banks. A second, third, and fourth time\r\nthe signal was repeated fainter and fainter, as if at a greater and\r\ngreater distance. It was obvious that a party of soldiers were near,\r\nand upon their guard, though not sufficiently so to detect men skilful\r\nin every art of predatory warfare, like those with whom he now watched\r\ntheir ineffectual precautions.\r\n\r\nWhen these sounds had died upon the silence of the night, the\r\nHighlanders began their march swiftly, yet with the most cautious\r\nsilence. Waverley had little time, or indeed disposition, for\r\nobservation, and could only discern that they passed at some distance\r\nfrom a large building, in the windows of which a light or two yet\r\nseemed to twinkle. A little farther on the leading Highlander snuffed\r\nthe wind like a setting spaniel, and then made a signal to his party\r\nagain to halt. He stooped down upon all fours, wrapped up in his plaid,\r\nso as to be scarce distinguishable from the heathy ground on which he\r\nmoved, and advanced in this posture to reconnoitre. In a short time he\r\nreturned, and dismissed his attendants excepting one; and, intimating\r\nto Waverley that he must imitate his cautious mode of proceeding, all\r\nthree crept forward on hands and knees.\r\n\r\nAfter proceeding a greater way in this inconvenient manner than was at\r\nall comfortable to his knees and shins, Waverley perceived the smell of\r\nsmoke, which probably had been much sooner distinguished by the more\r\nacute nasal organs of his guide. It proceeded from the corner of a low\r\nand ruinous sheep-fold, the walls of which were made of loose stones,\r\nas is usual in Scotland. Close by this low wall the Highlander guided\r\nWaverley, and, in order probably to make him sensible of his danger, or\r\nperhaps to obtain the full credit of his own dexterity, he intimated to\r\nhim, by sign and example, that he might raise his head so as to peep\r\ninto the sheep-fold. Waverley did so, and beheld an outpost of four or\r\nfive soldiers lying by their watch-fire. They were all asleep except\r\nthe sentinel, who paced backwards and forwards with his firelock on his\r\nshoulder, which glanced red in the light of the fire as he crossed and\r\nre-crossed before it in his short walk, casting his eye frequently to\r\nthat part of the heavens from which the moon, hitherto obscured by\r\nmist, seemed now about to make her appearance.\r\n\r\nIn the course of a minute or two, by one of those sudden changes of\r\natmosphere incident to a mountainous country, a breeze arose and swept\r\nbefore it the clouds which had covered the horizon, and the night\r\nplanet poured her full effulgence upon a wide and blighted heath,\r\nskirted indeed with copse-wood and stunted trees in the quarter from\r\nwhich they had come, but open and bare to the observation of the\r\nsentinel in that to which their course tended. The wall of the\r\nsheep-fold indeed concealed them as they lay, but any advance beyond\r\nits shelter seemed impossible without certain discovery.\r\n\r\nThe Highlander eyed the blue vault, but far from blessing the useful\r\nlight with Homer’s, or rather Pope’s benighted peasant, he muttered a\r\nGaelic curse upon the unseasonable splendour of _MacFarlane’s buat_\r\n(_i.e._ lantern[26]). He looked anxiously around for a few minutes, and\r\nthen apparently took his resolution. Leaving his attendant with\r\nWaverley, after motioning to Edward to remain quiet, and giving his\r\ncomrade directions in a brief whisper, he retreated, favoured by the\r\nirregularity of the ground, in the same direction and in the same\r\nmanner as they had advanced. Edward, turning his head after him, could\r\nperceive him crawling on all fours with the dexterity of an Indian,\r\navailing himself of every bush and inequality to escape observation,\r\nand never passing over the more exposed parts of his track until the\r\nsentinel’s back was turned from him. At length he reached the thickets\r\nand underwood which partly covered the moor in that direction, and\r\nprobably extended to the verge of the glen where Waverley had been so\r\nlong an inhabitant. The Highlander disappeared, but it was only for a\r\nfew minutes, for he suddenly issued forth from a different part of the\r\nthicket, and, advancing boldly upon the open heath as if to invite\r\ndiscovery, he levelled his piece and fired at the sentinel. A wound in\r\nthe arm proved a disagreeable interruption to the poor fellow’s\r\nmeteorological observations, as well as to the tune of “Nancy Dawson,”\r\nwhich he was whistling. He returned the fire ineffectually, and his\r\ncomrades, starting up at the alarm, advanced alertly towards the spot\r\nfrom which the first shot had issued. The Highlander, after giving them\r\na full view of his person, dived among the thickets, for his _ruse de\r\nguerre_ had now perfectly succeeded.\r\n\r\nWhile the soldiers pursued the cause of their disturbance in one\r\ndirection, Waverley, adopting the hint of his remaining attendant, made\r\nthe best of his speed in that which his guide originally intended to\r\npursue, and which now (the attention of the soldiers being drawn to a\r\ndifferent quarter) was unobserved and unguarded. When they had run\r\nabout a quarter of a mile, the brow of a rising ground which they had\r\nsurmounted concealed them from further risk of observation. They still\r\nheard, however, at a distance the shouts of the soldiers as they\r\nhallooed to each other upon the heath, and they could also hear the\r\ndistant roll of a drum beating to arms in the same direction. But these\r\nhostile sounds were now far in their rear, and died away upon the\r\nbreeze as they rapidly proceeded.\r\n\r\nWhen they had walked about half an hour, still along open and waste\r\nground of the same description, they came to the stump of an ancient\r\noak, which, from its relics, appeared to have been at one time a tree\r\nof very large size. In an adjacent hollow they found several\r\nHighlanders, with a horse or two. They had not joined them above a few\r\nminutes, which Waverley’s attendant employed, in all probability, in\r\ncommunicating the cause of their delay (for the words “Duncan Duroch”\r\nwere often repeated), when Duncan himself appeared, out of breath\r\nindeed, and with all the symptoms of having run for his life, but\r\nlaughing, and in high spirits at the success of the stratagem by which\r\nhe had baffled his pursuers. This indeed Waverley could easily conceive\r\nmight be a matter of no great difficulty to the active mountaineer, who\r\nwas perfectly acquainted with the ground, and traced his course with a\r\nfirmness and confidence to which his pursuers must have been strangers.\r\nThe alarm which he excited seemed still to continue, for a dropping\r\nshot or two were heard at a great distance, which seemed to serve as an\r\naddition to the mirth of Duncan and his comrades.\r\n\r\nThe mountaineer now resumed the arms with which he had entrusted our\r\nhero, giving him to understand that the dangers of the journey were\r\nhappily surmounted. Waverley was then mounted upon one of the horses, a\r\nchange which the fatigue of the night and his recent illness rendered\r\nexceedingly acceptable. His portmanteau was placed on another pony,\r\nDuncan mounted a third, and they set forward at a round pace,\r\naccompanied by their escort. No other incident marked the course of\r\nthat night’s journey, and at the dawn of morning they attained the\r\nbanks of a rapid river. The country around was at once fertile and\r\nromantic. Steep banks of wood were broken by corn-fields, which this\r\nyear presented an abundant harvest, already in a great measure cut\r\ndown.\r\n\r\nOn the opposite bank of the river, and partly surrounded by a winding\r\nof its stream, stood a large and massive castle, the half-ruined\r\nturrets of which were already glittering in the first rays of the\r\nsun.[27] It was in form an oblong square, of size sufficient to contain\r\na large court in the centre. The towers at each angle of the square\r\nrose higher than the walls of the building, and were in their turn\r\nsurmounted by turrets, differing in height and irregular in shape. Upon\r\none of these a sentinel watched, whose bonnet and plaid, streaming in\r\nthe wind, declared him to be a Highlander, as a broad white ensign,\r\nwhich floated from another tower, announced that the garrison was held\r\nby the insurgent adherents of the House of Stuart.\r\n\r\nPassing hastily through a small and mean town, where their appearance\r\nexcited neither surprise nor curiosity in the few peasants whom the\r\nlabours of the harvest began to summon from their repose, the party\r\ncrossed an ancient and narrow bridge of several arches, and, turning to\r\nthe left up an avenue of huge old sycamores, Waverley found himself in\r\nfront of the gloomy yet picturesque structure which he had admired at a\r\ndistance. A huge iron-grated door, which formed the exterior defence of\r\nthe gateway, was already thrown back to receive them; and a second,\r\nheavily constructed of oak and studded thickly with iron nails, being\r\nnext opened, admitted them into the interior court-yard. A gentleman,\r\ndressed in the Highland garb and having a white cockade in his bonnet,\r\nassisted Waverley to dismount from his horse, and with much courtesy\r\nbid him welcome to the castle.\r\n\r\nThe governor, for so we must term him, having conducted Waverley to a\r\nhalf-ruinous apartment, where, however, there was a small camp-bed, and\r\nhaving offered him any refreshment which he desired, was then about to\r\nleave him.\r\n\r\n“Will you not add to your civilities,” said Waverley, after having made\r\nthe usual acknowledgment, “by having the kindness to inform me where I\r\nam, and whether or not I am to consider myself as a prisoner?”\r\n\r\n“I am not at liberty to be so explicit upon this subject as I could\r\nwish. Briefly, however, you are in the Castle of Doune, in the district\r\nof Menteith, and in no danger whatever.”\r\n\r\n“And how am I assured of that?”\r\n\r\n“By the honour of Donald Stewart, governor of the garrison, and\r\nlieutenant-colonel in the service of his Royal Highness Prince Charles\r\nEdward.” So saying, he hastily left the apartment, as if to avoid\r\nfurther discussion.\r\n\r\nExhausted by the fatigues of the night, our hero now threw himself upon\r\nthe bed, and was in a few minutes fast asleep.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER X.\r\nTHE JOURNEY IS CONTINUED\r\n\r\n\r\nBefore Waverley awakened from his repose, the day was far advanced, and\r\nhe began to feel that he had passed many hours without food. This was\r\nsoon supplied in form of a copious breakfast, but Colonel Stewart, as\r\nif wishing to avoid the queries of his guest, did not again present\r\nhimself. His compliments were, however, delivered by a servant, with an\r\noffer to provide anything in his power that could be useful to Captain\r\nWaverley on his journey, which he intimated would be continued that\r\nevening. To Waverley’s further inquiries, the servant opposed the\r\nimpenetrable barrier of real or affected ignorance and stupidity. He\r\nremoved the table and provisions, and Waverley was again consigned to\r\nhis own meditations.\r\n\r\nAs he contemplated the strangeness of his fortune, which seemed to\r\ndelight in placing him at the disposal of others, without the power of\r\ndirecting his own motions, Edward’s eye suddenly rested upon his\r\nportmanteau, which had been deposited in his apartment during his\r\nsleep. The mysterious appearance of Alice in the cottage of the glen\r\nimmediately rushed upon his mind, and he was about to secure and\r\nexamine the packet which she had deposited among his clothes, when the\r\nservant of Colonel Stewart again made his appearance, and took up the\r\nportmanteau upon his shoulders.\r\n\r\n“May I not take out a change of linen, my friend?”\r\n\r\n“Your honour sall get ane o’ the Colonel’s ain ruffled sarks, but this\r\nmaun gang in the baggage-cart.”\r\n\r\nAnd so saying, he very coolly carried off the portmanteau, without\r\nwaiting further remonstrance, leaving our hero in a state where\r\ndisappointment and indignation struggled for the mastery. In a few\r\nminutes he heard a cart rumble out of the rugged court-yard, and made\r\nno doubt that he was now dispossessed, for a space at least, if not for\r\never, of the only documents which seemed to promise some light upon the\r\ndubious events which had of late influenced his destiny. With such\r\nmelancholy thoughts he had to beguile about four or five hours of\r\nsolitude.\r\n\r\nWhen this space was elapsed, the trampling of horse was heard in the\r\ncourt-yard, and Colonel Stewart soon after made his appearance to\r\nrequest his guest to take some further refreshment before his\r\ndeparture. The offer was accepted, for a late breakfast had by no means\r\nleft our hero incapable of doing honour to dinner, which was now\r\npresented. The conversation of his host was that of a plain country\r\ngentleman, mixed with some soldier-like sentiments and expressions. He\r\ncautiously avoided any reference to the military operations or civil\r\npolitics of the time; and to Waverley’s direct inquiries concerning\r\nsome of these points replied, that he was not at liberty to speak upon\r\nsuch topics.\r\n\r\nWhen dinner was finished the governor arose, and, wishing Edward a good\r\njourney, said that, having been informed by Waverley’s servant that his\r\nbaggage had been sent forward, he had taken the freedom to supply him\r\nwith such changes of linen as he might find necessary till he was again\r\npossessed of his own. With this compliment he disappeared. A servant\r\nacquainted Waverley an instant afterwards that his horse was ready.\r\n\r\nUpon this hint he descended into the court-yard, and found a trooper\r\nholding a saddled horse, on which he mounted and sallied from the\r\nportal of Doune Castle, attended by about a score of armed men on\r\nhorseback. These had less the appearance of regular soldiers than of\r\nindividuals who had suddenly assumed arms from some pressing motive of\r\nunexpected emergency. Their uniform, which was blue and red, an\r\naffected imitation of that of French chasseurs, was in many respects\r\nincomplete, and set awkwardly upon those who wore it. Waverley’s eye,\r\naccustomed to look at a well-disciplined regiment, could easily\r\ndiscover that the motions and habits of his escort were not those of\r\ntrained soldiers, and that, although expert enough in the management of\r\ntheir horses, their skill was that of huntsmen or grooms rather than of\r\ntroopers. The horses were not trained to the regular pace so necessary\r\nto execute simultaneous and combined movements and formations; nor did\r\nthey seem bitted (as it is technically expressed) for the use of the\r\nsword. The men, however, were stout, hardy-looking fellows, and might\r\nbe individually formidable as irregular cavalry. The commander of this\r\nsmall party was mounted upon an excellent hunter, and, although dressed\r\nin uniform, his change of apparel did not prevent Waverley from\r\nrecognising his old acquaintance, Mr. Falconer of Balmawhapple.\r\n\r\nNow, although the terms upon which Edward had parted with this\r\ngentleman were none of the most friendly, he would have sacrificed\r\nevery recollection of their foolish quarrel for the pleasure of\r\nenjoying once more the social intercourse of question and answer, from\r\nwhich he had been so long secluded. But apparently the remembrance of\r\nhis defeat by the Baron of Bradwardine, of which Edward had been the\r\nunwilling cause, still rankled in the mind of the low-bred and yet\r\nproud laird. He carefully avoided giving the least sign of recognition,\r\nriding doggedly at the head of his men, who, though scarce equal in\r\nnumbers to a sergeant’s party, were denominated Captain Falconer’s\r\ntroop, being preceded by a trumpet, which sounded from time to time,\r\nand a standard, borne by Cornet Falconer, the laird’s younger brother.\r\nThe lieutenant, an elderly man, had much the air of a low sportsman and\r\nboon companion; an expression of dry humour predominated in his\r\ncountenance over features of a vulgar cast, which indicated habitual\r\nintemperance. His cocked hat was set knowingly upon one side of his\r\nhead, and while he whistled the “Bob of Dumblain,” under the influence\r\nof half a mutchkin of brandy, he seemed to trot merrily forward, with a\r\nhappy indifference to the state of the country, the conduct of the\r\nparty, the end of the journey, and all other sublunary matters\r\nwhatever.\r\n\r\nFrom this wight, who now and then dropped alongside of his horse,\r\nWaverley hoped to acquire some information, or at least to beguile the\r\nway with talk.\r\n\r\n“A fine evening, sir,” was Edward’s salutation.\r\n\r\n“Ow, ay, sir! a bra’ night,” replied the lieutenant, in broad Scotch of\r\nthe most vulgar description.\r\n\r\n“And a fine harvest, apparently,” continued Waverley, following up his\r\nfirst attack.\r\n\r\n“Ay, the aits will be got bravely in; but the farmers, deil burst them,\r\nand the corn-mongers will make the auld price gude against them as has\r\nhorses till keep.”\r\n\r\n“You perhaps act as quartermaster, sir?”\r\n\r\n“Ay, quartermaster, riding-master, and lieutenant,” answered this\r\nofficer of all work. “And, to be sure, wha’s fitter to look after the\r\nbreaking and the keeping of the poor beasts than mysell, that bought\r\nand sold every ane o’ them?”\r\n\r\n“And pray, sir, if it be not too great a freedom, may I beg to know\r\nwhere we are going just now?”\r\n\r\n“A fule’s errand, I fear,” answered this communicative personage.\r\n\r\n“In that case,” said Waverley, determined not to spare civility, “I\r\nshould have thought a person of your appearance would not have been\r\nfound on the road.”\r\n\r\n“Vera true, vera true, sir,” replied the officer, “but every why has\r\nits wherefore. Ye maun ken, the laird there bought a’ thir beasts frae\r\nme to munt his troop, and agreed to pay for them according to the\r\nnecessities and prices of the time. But then he hadna the ready penny,\r\nand I hae been advised his bond will not be worth a boddle against the\r\nestate, and then I had a’ my dealers to settle wi’ at Martinmas; and\r\nso, as he very kindly offered me this commission, and as the auld\r\n_Fifteen_[*] wad never help me to my siller for sending out naigs\r\nagainst the government, why, conscience! sir, I thought my best chance\r\nfor payment was e’en to _gae out_[28] mysell; and ye may judge, sir, as\r\nI hae dealt a’ my life in halters, I think na mickle o’ putting my\r\ncraig in peril of a Saint John-stone’s tippet.”\r\n\r\n[* The Judges of the Supreme Court of Session in Scotland are\r\nproverbially termed among the country people, The Fifteen.]\r\n\r\n“You are not, then, by profession a soldier?” said Waverley.\r\n\r\n“Na, na; thank God,” answered this doughty partizan, “I wasna bred at\r\nsae short a tether, I was brought up to hack and manger. I was bred a\r\nhorse-couper, sir; and if I might live to see you at Whitson-tryst, or\r\nat Stagshawbank, or the winter fair at Hawick, and ye wanted a spanker\r\nthat would lead the field, I’se be caution I would serve ye easy; for\r\nJamie Jinker was ne’er the lad to impose upon a gentleman. Ye’re a\r\ngentleman, sir, and should ken a horse’s points; ye see that\r\nthrough-ganging thing that Balmawhapple’s on; I selled her till him.\r\nShe was bred out of Lick-the-ladle, that wan the king’s plate at\r\nCaverton-Edge, by Duke Hamilton’s White-Foot,” etc., etc., etc.\r\n\r\nBut as Jinker was entered full sail upon the pedigree of Balmawhapple’s\r\nmare, having already got as far as great-grandsire and great-grand-dam,\r\nand while Waverley was watching for an opportunity to obtain from him\r\nintelligence of more interest, the noble captain checked his horse\r\nuntil they came up, and then, without directly appearing to notice\r\nEdward, said sternly to the genealogist, “I thought, lieutenant, my\r\norders were preceese, that no one should speak to the prisoner?”\r\n\r\nThe metamorphosed horse-dealer was silenced of course, and slunk to the\r\nrear, where he consoled himself by entering into a vehement dispute\r\nupon the price of hay with a farmer who had reluctantly followed his\r\nlaird to the field rather than give up his farm, whereof the lease had\r\njust expired. Waverley was therefore once more consigned to silence,\r\nforeseeing that further attempts at conversation with any of the party\r\nwould only give Balmawhapple a wished-for opportunity to display the\r\ninsolence of authority, and the sulky spite of a temper naturally\r\ndogged, and rendered more so by habits of low indulgence and the\r\nincense of servile adulation.\r\n\r\nIn about two hours’ time the party were near the Castle of Stirling,\r\nover whose battlements the union flag was brightened as it waved in the\r\nevening sun. To shorten his journey, or perhaps to display his\r\nimportance and insult the English garrison, Balmawhapple, inclining to\r\nthe right, took his route through the royal park, which reaches to and\r\nsurrounds the rock upon which the fortress is situated.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nWith a mind more at ease Waverley could not have failed to admire the\r\nmixture of romance and beauty which renders interesting the scene\r\nthrough which he was now passing—the field which had been the scene of\r\nthe tournaments of old—the rock from which the ladies beheld the\r\ncontest, while each made vows for the success of some favourite\r\nknight—the towers of the Gothic church, where these vows might be\r\npaid—and, surmounting all, the fortress itself, at once a castle and\r\npalace, where valour received the prize from royalty, and knights and\r\ndames closed the evening amid the revelry of the dance, the song, and\r\nthe feast. All these were objects fitted to arouse and interest a\r\nromantic imagination.\r\n\r\nBut Waverley had other objects of meditation, and an incident soon\r\noccurred of a nature to disturb meditation of any kind. Balmawhapple,\r\nin the pride of his heart, as he wheeled his little body of cavalry\r\nround the base of the Castle, commanded his trumpet to sound a flourish\r\nand his standard to be displayed. This insult produced apparently some\r\nsensation; for when the cavalcade was at such distance from the\r\nsouthern battery as to admit of a gun being depressed so as to bear\r\nupon them, a flash of fire issued from one of the embrazures upon the\r\nrock; and ere the report with which it was attended could be heard, the\r\nrushing sound of a cannon-ball passed over Balmawhapple’s head, and the\r\nbullet, burying itself in the ground at a few yards’ distance, covered\r\nhim with the earth which it drove up. There was no need to bid the\r\nparty trudge. In fact, every man, acting upon the impulse of the\r\nmoment, soon brought Mr. Jinker’s steeds to show their mettle, and the\r\ncavaliers, retreating with more speed than regularity, never took to a\r\ntrot, as the lieutenant afterwards observed, until an intervening\r\neminence had secured them from any repetition of so undesirable a\r\ncompliment on the part of Stirling Castle. I must do Balmawhapple,\r\nhowever, the justice to say that he not only kept the rear of his\r\ntroop, and laboured to maintain some order among them, but, in the\r\nheight of his gallantry, answered the fire of the Castle by discharging\r\none of his horse-pistols at the battlements; although, the distance\r\nbeing nearly half a mile, I could never learn that this measure of\r\nretaliation was attended with any particular effect.\r\n\r\nThe travellers now passed the memorable field of Bannockburn and\r\nreached the Torwood, a place glorious or terrible to the recollections\r\nof the Scottish peasant, as the feats of Wallace or the cruelties of\r\nWude Willie Grime predominate in his recollection. At Falkirk, a town\r\nformerly famous in Scottish history, and soon to be again distinguished\r\nas the scene of military events of importance, Balmawhapple proposed to\r\nhalt and repose for the evening. This was performed with very little\r\nregard to military discipline, his worthy quarter-master being chiefly\r\nsolicitous to discover where the best brandy might be come at.\r\nSentinels were deemed unnecessary, and the only vigils performed were\r\nthose of such of the party as could procure liquor. A few resolute men\r\nmight easily have cut off the detachment; but of the inhabitants some\r\nwere favourable, many indifferent, and the rest overawed. So nothing\r\nmemorable occurred in the course of the evening, except that Waverley’s\r\nrest was sorely interrupted by the revellers hallooing forth their\r\nJacobite songs, without remorse or mitigation of voice.\r\n\r\nEarly in the morning they were again mounted and on the road to\r\nEdinburgh, though the pallid visages of some of the troop betrayed that\r\nthey had spent a night of sleepless debauchery. They halted at\r\nLinlithgow, distinguished by its ancient palace, which Sixty Years\r\nSince was entire and habitable, and whose venerable ruins, _not quite\r\nSixty Years since_, very narrowly escaped the unworthy fate of being\r\nconverted into a barrack for French prisoners. May repose and blessings\r\nattend the ashes of the patriotic statesman who, amongst his last\r\nservices to Scotland, interposed to prevent this profanation!\r\n\r\nAs they approached the metropolis of Scotland, through a champaign and\r\ncultivated country, the sounds of war began to be heard. The distant\r\nyet distinct report of heavy cannon, fired at intervals, apprized\r\nWaverley that the work of destruction was going forward. Even\r\nBalmawhapple seemed moved to take some precautions, by sending an\r\nadvanced party in front of his troop, keeping the main body in\r\ntolerable order, and moving steadily forward.\r\n\r\nMarching in this manner they speedily reached an eminence, from which\r\nthey could view Edinburgh stretching along the ridgy hill which slopes\r\neastward from the Castle. The latter, being in a state of siege, or\r\nrather of blockade, by the northern insurgents, who had already\r\noccupied the town for two or three days, fired at intervals upon such\r\nparties of Highlanders as exposed themselves, either on the main street\r\nor elsewhere in the vicinity of the fortress. The morning being calm\r\nand fair, the effect of this dropping fire was to invest the Castle in\r\nwreaths of smoke, the edges of which dissipated slowly in the air,\r\nwhile the central veil was darkened ever and anon by fresh clouds\r\npoured forth from the battlements; the whole giving, by the partial\r\nconcealment, an appearance of grandeur and gloom, rendered more\r\nterrific when Waverley reflected on the cause by which it was produced,\r\nand that each explosion might ring some brave man’s knell.\r\n\r\nEre they approached the city the partial cannonade had wholly ceased.\r\nBalmawhapple, however, having in his recollection the unfriendly\r\ngreeting which his troop had received from the battery at Stirling, had\r\napparently no wish to tempt the forbearance of the artillery of the\r\nCastle. He therefore left the direct road, and, sweeping considerably\r\nto the southward so as to keep out of the range of the cannon,\r\napproached the ancient palace of Holyrood without having entered the\r\nwalls of the city. He then drew up his men in front of that venerable\r\npile, and delivered Waverley to the custody of a guard of Highlanders,\r\nwhose officer conducted him into the interior of the building.\r\n\r\nA long, low, and ill-proportioned gallery, hung with pictures, affirmed\r\nto be the portraits of kings, who, if they ever flourished at all,\r\nlived several hundred years before the invention of painting in oil\r\ncolours, served as a sort of guard chamber or vestibule to the\r\napartments which the adventurous Charles Edward now occupied in the\r\npalace of his ancestors. Officers, both in the Highland and Lowland\r\ngarb, passed and repassed in haste, or loitered in the hall as if\r\nwaiting for orders. Secretaries were engaged in making out passes,\r\nmusters, and returns. All seemed busy, and earnestly intent upon\r\nsomething of importance; but Waverley was suffered to remain seated in\r\nthe recess of a window, unnoticed by any one, in anxious reflection\r\nupon the crisis of his fate, which seemed now rapidly approaching.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XI.\r\nAN OLD AND A NEW ACQUAINTANCE\r\n\r\n\r\nWhile he was deep sunk in his reverie, the rustle of tartans was heard\r\nbehind him, a friendly arm clasped his shoulders, and a friendly voice\r\nexclaimed,\r\n\r\n“Said the Highland prophet sooth? Or must second-sight go for nothing?”\r\n\r\nWaverley turned, and was warmly embraced by Fergus Mac-Ivor. “A\r\nthousand welcomes to Holyrood, once more possessed by her legitimate\r\nsovereign! Did I not say we should prosper, and that you would fall\r\ninto the hands of the Philistines if you parted from us?”\r\n\r\n“Dear Fergus!” said Waverley, eagerly returning his greeting. “It is\r\nlong since I have heard a friend’s voice. Where is Flora?”\r\n\r\n“Safe, and a triumphant spectator of our success.”\r\n\r\n“In this place?” said Waverley.\r\n\r\n“Ay, in this city at least,” answered his friend, “and you shall see\r\nher; but first you must meet a friend whom you little think of, who has\r\nbeen frequent in his inquiries after you.”\r\n\r\nThus saying, he dragged Waverley by the arm out of the guard chamber,\r\nand, ere he knew where he was conducted, Edward found himself in a\r\npresence room, fitted up with some attempt at royal state.\r\n\r\nA young man, wearing his own fair hair, distinguished by the dignity of\r\nhis mien and the noble expression of his well-formed and regular\r\nfeatures, advanced out of a circle of military gentlemen and Highland\r\nchiefs by whom he was surrounded. In his easy and graceful manners\r\nWaverley afterwards thought he could have discovered his high birth and\r\nrank, although the star on his breast and the embroidered garter at his\r\nknee had not appeared as its indications.\r\n\r\n“Let me present to your Royal Highness,” said Fergus, bowing\r\nprofoundly—\r\n\r\n“The descendant of one of the most ancient and loyal families in\r\nEngland,” said the young Chevalier, interrupting him. “I beg your\r\npardon for interrupting you, my dear Mac-Ivor; but no master of\r\nceremonies is necessary to present a Waverley to a Stuart.”\r\n\r\nThus saying, he extended his hand to Edward with the utmost courtesy,\r\nwho could not, had he desired it, have avoided rendering him the homage\r\nwhich seemed due to his rank, and was certainly the right of his birth.\r\n“I am sorry to understand, Mr. Waverley, that, owing to circumstances\r\nwhich have been as yet but ill explained, you have suffered some\r\nrestraint among my followers in Perthshire and on your march here; but\r\nwe are in such a situation that we hardly know our friends, and I am\r\neven at this moment uncertain whether I can have the pleasure of\r\nconsidering Mr. Waverley as among mine.”\r\n\r\nHe then paused for an instant; but before Edward could adjust a\r\nsuitable reply, or even arrange his ideas as to its purport, the Prince\r\ntook out a paper and then proceeded:—“I should indeed have no doubts\r\nupon this subject if I could trust to this proclamation, set forth by\r\nthe friends of the Elector of Hanover, in which they rank Mr. Waverley\r\namong the nobility and gentry who are menaced with the pains of\r\nhigh-treason for loyalty to their legitimate sovereign. But I desire to\r\ngain no adherents save from affection and conviction; and if Mr.\r\nWaverley inclines to prosecute his journey to the south, or to join the\r\nforces of the Elector, he shall have my passport and free permission to\r\ndo so; and I can only regret that my present power will not extend to\r\nprotect him against the probable consequences of such a measure. But,”\r\ncontinued Charles Edward, after another short pause, “if Mr. Waverley\r\nshould, like his ancestor, Sir Nigel, determine to embrace a cause\r\nwhich has little to recommend it but its justice, and follow a prince\r\nwho throws himself upon the affections of his people to recover the\r\nthrone of his ancestors or perish in the attempt, I can only say, that\r\namong these nobles and gentlemen he will find worthy associates in a\r\ngallant enterprise, and will follow a master who may be unfortunate,\r\nbut, I trust, will never be ungrateful.”\r\n\r\nThe politic Chieftain of the race of Ivor knew his advantage in\r\nintroducing Waverley to this personal interview with the royal\r\nadventurer. Unaccustomed to the address and manners of a polished\r\ncourt, in which Charles was eminently skilful, his words and his\r\nkindness penetrated the heart of our hero, and easily outweighed all\r\nprudential motives. To be thus personally solicited for assistance by a\r\nprince whose form and manners, as well as the spirit which he displayed\r\nin this singular enterprise, answered his ideas of a hero of romance;\r\nto be courted by him in the ancient halls of his paternal palace,\r\nrecovered by the sword which he was already bending towards other\r\nconquests, gave Edward, in his own eyes, the dignity and importance\r\nwhich he had ceased to consider as his attributes. Rejected, slandered,\r\nand threatened upon the one side, he was irresistibly attracted to the\r\ncause which the prejudices of education and the political principles of\r\nhis family had already recommended as the most just. These thoughts\r\nrushed through his mind like a torrent, sweeping before them every\r\nconsideration of an opposite tendency,—the time, besides, admitted of\r\nno deliberation,—and Waverley, kneeling to Charles Edward, devoted his\r\nheart and sword to the vindication of his rights!\r\n\r\nThe Prince (for, although unfortunate in the faults and follies of his\r\nforefathers, we shall here and elsewhere give him the title due to his\r\nbirth) raised Waverley from the ground and embraced him with an\r\nexpression of thanks too warm not to be genuine. He also thanked Fergus\r\nMac-Ivor repeatedly for having brought him such an adherent, and\r\npresented Waverley to the various noblemen, chieftains, and officers\r\nwho were about his person as a young gentleman of the highest hopes and\r\nprospects, in whose bold and enthusiastic avowal of his cause they\r\nmight see an evidence of the sentiments of the English families of rank\r\nat this important crisis.[29] Indeed, this was a point much doubted\r\namong the adherents of the house of Stuart; and as a well-founded\r\ndisbelief in the cooperation of the English Jacobites kept many\r\nScottish men of rank from his standard, and diminished the courage of\r\nthose who had joined it, nothing could be more seasonable for the\r\nChevalier than the open declaration in his favour of the representative\r\nof the house of Waverley-Honour, so long known as Cavaliers and\r\nRoyalists. This Fergus had foreseen from the beginning. He really loved\r\nWaverley, because their feelings and projects never thwarted each\r\nother; he hoped to see him united with Flora, and he rejoiced that they\r\nwere effectually engaged in the same cause. But, as we before hinted,\r\nhe also exulted as a politician in beholding secured to his party a\r\npartizan of such consequence; and he was far from being insensible to\r\nthe personal importance which he himself gained with the Prince from\r\nhaving so materially assisted in making the acquisition.\r\n\r\nCharles Edward, on his part, seemed eager to show his attendants the\r\nvalue which he attached to his new adherent, by entering immediately,\r\nas in confidence, upon the circumstances of his situation. “You have\r\nbeen secluded so much from intelligence, Mr. Waverley, from causes of\r\nwhich I am but indistinctly informed, that I presume you are even yet\r\nunacquainted with the important particulars of my present situation.\r\nYou have, however, heard of my landing in the remote district of\r\nMoidart, with only seven attendants, and of the numerous chiefs and\r\nclans whose loyal enthusiasm at once placed a solitary adventurer at\r\nthe head of a gallant army. You must also, I think, have learned that\r\nthe commander-in-chief of the Hanoverian Elector, Sir John Cope,\r\nmarched into the Highlands at the head of a numerous and well-appointed\r\nmilitary force with the intention of giving us battle, but that his\r\ncourage failed him when we were within three hours’ march of each\r\nother, so that he fairly gave us the slip and marched northward to\r\nAberdeen, leaving the Low Country open and undefended. Not to lose so\r\nfavourable an opportunity, I marched on to this metropolis, driving\r\nbefore me two regiments of horse, Gardiner’s and Hamilton’s, who had\r\nthreatened to cut to pieces every Highlander that should venture to\r\npass Stirling; and while discussions were carrying forward among the\r\nmagistracy and citizens of Edinburgh whether they should defend\r\nthemselves or surrender, my good friend Lochiel (laying his hand on the\r\nshoulder of that gallant and accomplished chieftain) saved them the\r\ntrouble of farther deliberation by entering the gates with five hundred\r\nCamerons. Thus far, therefore, we have done well; but, in the\r\nmeanwhile, this doughty general’s nerves being braced by the keen air\r\nof Aberdeen, he has taken shipping for Dunbar, and I have just received\r\ncertain information that he landed there yesterday. His purpose must\r\nunquestionably be to march towards us to recover possession of the\r\ncapital. Now there are two opinions in my council of war: one, that\r\nbeing inferior probably in numbers, and certainly in discipline and\r\nmilitary appointments, not to mention our total want of artillery and\r\nthe weakness of our cavalry, it will be safest to fall back towards the\r\nmountains, and there protract the war until fresh succours arrive from\r\nFrance, and the whole body of the Highland clans shall have taken arms\r\nin our favour. The opposite opinion maintains, that a retrograde\r\nmovement, in our circumstances, is certain to throw utter discredit on\r\nour arms and undertaking; and, far from gaining us new partizans, will\r\nbe the means of disheartening those who have joined our standard. The\r\nofficers who use these last arguments, among whom is your friend Fergus\r\nMac-Ivor, maintain that, if the Highlanders are strangers to the usual\r\nmilitary discipline of Europe, the soldiers whom they are to encounter\r\nare no less strangers to their peculiar and formidable mode of attack;\r\nthat the attachment and courage of the chiefs and gentlemen are not to\r\nbe doubted; and that, as they will be in the midst of the enemy, their\r\nclansmen will as surely follow them; in fine, that having drawn the\r\nsword we should throw away the scabbard, and trust our cause to battle\r\nand to the God of battles. Will Mr. Waverley favour us with his opinion\r\nin these arduous circumstances?”\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nWaverley coloured high betwixt pleasure and modesty at the distinction\r\nimplied in this question, and answered, with equal spirit and\r\nreadiness, that he could not venture to offer an opinion as derived\r\nfrom military skill, but that the counsel would be far the most\r\nacceptable to him which should first afford him an opportunity to\r\nevince his zeal in his Royal Highness’s service.\r\n\r\n“Spoken like a Waverley!” answered Charles Edward; “and that you may\r\nhold a rank in some degree corresponding to your name, allow me,\r\ninstead of the captain’s commission which you have lost, to offer you\r\nthe brevet rank of major in my service, with the advantage of acting as\r\none of my aides-de-camp until you can be attached to a regiment, of\r\nwhich I hope several will be speedily embodied.”\r\n\r\n“Your Royal Highness will forgive me,” answered Waverley (for his\r\nrecollection turned to Balmawhapple and his scanty troop), “if I\r\ndecline accepting any rank until the time and place where I may have\r\ninterest enough to raise a sufficient body of men to make my command\r\nuseful to your Royal Highness’s service. In the meanwhile, I hope for\r\nyour permission to serve as a volunteer under my friend Fergus\r\nMac-Ivor.”\r\n\r\n“At least,” said the Prince, who was obviously pleased with this\r\nproposal, “allow me the pleasure of arming you after the Highland\r\nfashion.” With these words, he unbuckled the broadsword which he wore,\r\nthe belt of which was plaited with silver, and the steel basket-hilt\r\nrichly and curiously inlaid. “The blade,” said the Prince, “is a\r\ngenuine Andrea Ferrara; it has been a sort of heirloom in our family;\r\nbut I am convinced I put it into better hands than my own, and will add\r\nto it pistols of the same workmanship. Colonel Mac-Ivor, you must have\r\nmuch to say to your friend; I will detain you no longer from your\r\nprivate conversation; but remember we expect you both to attend us in\r\nthe evening. It may be perhaps the last night we may enjoy in these\r\nhalls, and as we go to the field with a clear conscience, we will spend\r\nthe eve of battle merrily.”\r\n\r\nThus licensed, the Chief and Waverley left the presence-chamber.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XII.\r\nTHE MYSTERY BEGINS TO BE CLEARED UP\r\n\r\n\r\n“How do you like him?” was Fergus’s first question, as they descended\r\nthe large stone staircase.\r\n\r\n“A prince to live and die under” was Waverley’s enthusiastic answer.\r\n\r\n“I knew you would think so when you saw him, and I intended you should\r\nhave met earlier, but was prevented by your sprain. And yet he has his\r\nfoibles, or rather he has difficult cards to play, and his Irish\r\nofficers,[30] who are much about him, are but sorry advisers: they\r\ncannot discriminate among the numerous pretensions that are set up.\r\nWould you think it—I have been obliged for the present to suppress an\r\nearl’s patent, granted for services rendered ten years ago, for fear of\r\nexciting the jealousy, forsooth, of C—— and M——? But you were very\r\nright, Edward, to refuse the situation of aide-de-camp. There are two\r\nvacant, indeed, but Clanronald and Lochiel, and almost all of us, have\r\nrequested one for young Aberchallader, and the Lowlanders and the Irish\r\nparty are equally desirous to have the other for the master of F——.\r\nNow, if either of these candidates were to be superseded in your\r\nfavour, you would make enemies. And then I am surprised that the Prince\r\nshould have offered you a majority, when he knows very well that\r\nnothing short of lieutenant-colonel will satisfy others, who cannot\r\nbring one hundred and fifty men to the field. “But patience, cousin,\r\nand shuffle the cards!” It is all very well for the present, and we\r\nmust have you properly equipped for the evening in your new costume;\r\nfor, to say truth, your outward man is scarce fit for a court.”\r\n\r\n“Why,” said Waverley, looking at his soiled dress, “my shooting jacket\r\nhas seen service since we parted; but that probably you, my friend,\r\nknow as well or better than I.”\r\n\r\n“You do my second-sight too much honour,” said Fergus. “We were so\r\nbusy, first with the scheme of giving battle to Cope, and afterwards\r\nwith our operations in the Lowlands, that I could only give general\r\ndirections to such of our people as were left in Perthshire to respect\r\nand protect you, should you come in their way. But let me hear the full\r\nstory of your adventures, for they have reached us in a very partial\r\nand mutilated manner.”\r\n\r\nWaverley then detailed at length the circumstances with which the\r\nreader is already acquainted, to which Fergus listened with great\r\nattention. By this time they had reached the door of his quarters,\r\nwhich he had taken up in a small paved court, retiring from the street\r\ncalled the Canongate, at the house of a buxom widow of forty, who\r\nseemed to smile very graciously upon the handsome young Chief, she\r\nbeing a person with whom good looks and good-humour were sure to secure\r\nan interest, whatever might be the party’s “political opinions”. Here\r\nCallum Beg received them with a smile of recognition. “Callum,” said\r\nthe Chief, “call Shemus an Snachad” (James of the Needle). This was the\r\nhereditary tailor of Vich Ian Vohr. “Shemus, Mr. Waverley is to wear\r\nthe _cath dath_ (battle colour, or tartan); his trews must be ready in\r\nfour hours. You know the measure of a well-made man—two double nails to\r\nthe small of the leg—”\r\n\r\n“Eleven from haunch to heel, seven round the waist. I give your honour\r\nleave to hang Shemus, if there’s a pair of sheers in the Highlands that\r\nhas a baulder sneck than her’s ain at the _cumadh an truais_” (shape of\r\nthe trews).\r\n\r\n“Get a plaid of Mac-Ivor tartan and sash,” continued the Chieftain,\r\n“and a blue bonnet of the Prince’s pattern, at Mr. Mouat’s in the\r\nCrames. My short green coat, with silver lace and silver buttons, will\r\nfit him exactly, and I have never worn it. Tell Ensign Maccombich to\r\npick out a handsome target from among mine. The Prince has given Mr.\r\nWaverley broadsword and pistols, I will furnish him with a dirk and\r\npurse; add but a pair of low-heeled shoes, and then, my dear Edward\r\n(turning to him), you will be a complete son of Ivor.”\r\n\r\nThese necessary directions given, the Chieftain resumed the subject of\r\nWaverley’s adventures. “It is plain,” he said, “that you have been in\r\nthe custody of Donald Bean Lean. You must know that, when I marched\r\naway my clan to join the Prince, I laid my injunctions on that worthy\r\nmember of society to perform a certain piece of service, which done, he\r\nwas to join me with all the force he could muster. But, instead of\r\ndoing so, the gentleman, finding the coast clear, thought it better to\r\nmake war on his own account, and has scoured the country, plundering, I\r\nbelieve, both friend and foe, under pretence of levying blackmail,\r\nsometimes as if by my authority, and sometimes (and be cursed to his\r\nconsummate impudence) in his own great name! Upon my honour, if I live\r\nto see the cairn of Benmore again, I shall be tempted to hang that\r\nfellow! I recognise his hand particularly in the mode of your rescue\r\nfrom that canting rascal Gilfillan, and I have little doubt that Donald\r\nhimself played the part of the pedlar on that occasion; but how he\r\nshould not have plundered you, or put you to ransom, or availed himself\r\nin some way or other of your captivity for his own advantage, passes my\r\njudgment.”\r\n\r\n“When and how did you hear the intelligence of my confinement?” asked\r\nWaverley.\r\n\r\n“The Prince himself told me,” said Fergus, “and inquired very minutely\r\ninto your history. He then mentioned your being at that moment in the\r\npower of one of our northern parties—you know I could not ask him to\r\nexplain particulars—and requested my opinion about disposing of you. I\r\nrecommended that you should be brought here as a prisoner, because I\r\ndid not wish to prejudice you farther with the English government, in\r\ncase you pursued your purpose of going southward. I knew nothing, you\r\nmust recollect, of the charge brought against you of aiding and\r\nabetting high treason, which, I presume, had some share in changing\r\nyour original plan. That sullen, good-for-nothing brute, Balmawhapple,\r\nwas sent to escort you from Doune, with what he calls his troop of\r\nhorse. As to his behaviour, in addition to his natural antipathy to\r\neverything that resembles a gentleman, I presume his adventure with\r\nBradwardine rankles in his recollection, the rather that I daresay his\r\nmode of telling that story contributed to the evil reports which\r\nreached your quondam regiment.”\r\n\r\n“Very likely,” said Waverley; “but now surely, my dear Fergus, you may\r\nfind time to tell me something of Flora.”\r\n\r\n“Why,” replied Fergus, “I can only tell you that she is well, and\r\nresiding for the present with a relation in this city. I thought it\r\nbetter she should come here, as since our success a good many ladies of\r\nrank attend our military court; and I assure you that there is a sort\r\nof consequence annexed to the near relative of such a person as Flora\r\nMac-Ivor, and where there is such a justling of claims and requests, a\r\nman must use every fair means to enhance his importance.”\r\n\r\nThere was something in this last sentence which grated on Waverley’s\r\nfeelings. He could not bear that Flora should be considered as\r\nconducing to her brother’s preferment by the admiration which she must\r\nunquestionably attract; and although it was in strict correspondence\r\nwith many points of Fergus’s character, it shocked him as selfish, and\r\nunworthy of his sister’s high mind and his own independent pride.\r\nFergus, to whom such manœuvres were familiar, as to one brought up at\r\nthe French court, did not observe the unfavourable impression which he\r\nhad unwarily made upon his friend’s mind, and concluded by saying,\r\nthat they could hardly see Flora before the evening, when she would be\r\nat the concert and ball with which the Prince’s party were to be\r\nentertained. “She and I had a quarrel about her not appearing to take\r\nleave of you. I am unwilling to renew it by soliciting her to receive\r\nyou this morning; and perhaps my doing so might not only be\r\nineffectual, but prevent your meeting this evening.”\r\n\r\nWhile thus conversing, Waverley heard in the court, before the windows\r\nof the parlour, a well-known voice. “I aver to you, my worthy friend,”\r\nsaid the speaker, “that it is a total dereliction of military\r\ndiscipline; and were you not as it were a _tyro_, your purpose would\r\ndeserve strong reprobation. For a prisoner of war is on no account to\r\nbe coerced with fetters, or debinded _in ergastulo_, as would have been\r\nthe case had you put this gentleman into the pit of the peel-house at\r\nBalmawhapple. I grant, indeed, that such a prisoner may for security be\r\ncoerced _in carcere_, that is, in a public prison.”\r\n\r\nThe growling voice of Balmawhapple was heard as taking leave in\r\ndispleasure, but the word “land-louper” alone was distinctly audible.\r\nHe had disappeared before Waverley reached the house in order to greet\r\nthe worthy Baron of Bradwardine. The uniform in which he was now\r\nattired, a blue coat, namely, with gold lace, a scarlet waistcoat and\r\nbreeches, and immense jack-boots, seemed to have added fresh stiffness\r\nand rigidity to his tall, perpendicular figure; and the consciousness\r\nof military command and authority had increased, in the same\r\nproportion, the self-importance of his demeanour and the dogmatism of\r\nhis conversation.\r\n\r\nHe received Waverley with his usual kindness, and expressed immediate\r\nanxiety to hear an explanation of the circumstances attending the loss\r\nof his commission in Gardiner’s dragoons; “not,” he said, “that he had\r\nthe least apprehension of his young friend having done aught which\r\ncould merit such ungenerous treatment as he had received from\r\ngovernment, but because it was right and seemly that the Baron of\r\nBradwardine should be, in point of trust and in point of power, fully\r\nable to refute all calumnies against the heir of Waverley-Honour, whom\r\nhe had so much right to regard as his own son.”\r\n\r\nFergus Mac-Ivor, who had now joined them, went hastily over the\r\ncircumstances of Waverley’s story, and concluded with the flattering\r\nreception he had met from the young Chevalier. The Baron listened in\r\nsilence, and at the conclusion shook Waverley heartily by the hand and\r\ncongratulated him upon entering the service of his lawful Prince.\r\n“For,” continued he, “although it has been justly held in all nations a\r\nmatter of scandal and dishonour to infringe the _sacramentum militare_,\r\nand that whether it was taken by each soldier singly, whilk the Romans\r\ndenominated _per conjurationem_, or by one soldier in name of the rest,\r\nyet no one ever doubted that the allegiance so sworn was discharged by\r\nthe _dimissio_, or discharging of a soldier, whose case would be as\r\nhard as that of colliers, salters, and other _adscripti glebæ_, or\r\nslaves of the soil, were it to be accounted otherwise. This is\r\nsomething like the brocard expressed by the learned Sanchez in his work\r\n_De Jure-jurando_ which you have questionless consulted upon this\r\noccasion. As for those who have calumniated you by leasing-making, I\r\nprotest to Heaven I think they have justly incurred the penalty of the\r\n_Memnonia Lex_, also called _Lex Rhemnia_, which is prelected upon by\r\nTullius in his oration _In Verrem_. I should have deemed, however, Mr.\r\nWaverley, that before destining yourself to any special service in the\r\narmy of the Prince, ye might have inquired what rank the old\r\nBradwardine held there, and whether he would not have been peculiarly\r\nhappy to have had your services in the regiment of horse which he is\r\nnow about to levy.” Edward eluded this reproach by pleading the\r\nnecessity of giving an immediate answer to the Prince’s proposal, and\r\nhis uncertainty at the moment whether his friend the Baron was with the\r\narmy or engaged upon service elsewhere.\r\n\r\nThis punctilio being settled, Waverley made inquiry after Miss\r\nBradwardine, and was informed she had come to Edinburgh with Flora\r\nMac-Ivor, under guard of a party of the Chieftain’s men. This step was\r\nindeed necessary, Tully-Veolan having become a very unpleasant, and\r\neven dangerous, place of residence for an unprotected young lady, on\r\naccount of its vicinity to the Highlands, and also to one or two large\r\nvillages which, from aversion as much to the caterans as zeal for\r\npresbytery, had declared themselves on the side of government, and\r\nformed irregular bodies of partizans, who had frequent skirmishes with\r\nthe mountaineers, and sometimes attacked the houses of the Jacobite\r\ngentry in the braes, or frontier betwixt the mountain and plain.\r\n\r\n“I would propose to you,” continued the Baron, “to walk as far as my\r\nquarters in the Luckenbooths, and to admire in your passage the High\r\nStreet, whilk is, beyond a shadow of dubitation, finer than any street\r\nwhether in London or Paris. But Rose, poor thing, is sorely discomposed\r\nwith the firing of the Castle, though I have proved to her from Blondel\r\nand Coehorn, that it is impossible a bullet can reach these buildings;\r\nand, besides, I have it in charge from his Royal Highness to go to the\r\ncamp, or leaguer of our army, to see that the men do _conclamare vasa_,\r\nthat is, truss up their bag and baggage for tomorrow’s march.”\r\n\r\n“That will be easily done by most of us,” said Mac-Ivor, laughing.\r\n\r\n“Craving your pardon, Colonel Mac-Ivor, not quite so easily as ye seem\r\nto opine. I grant most of your folk left the Highlands expedited as it\r\nwere, and free from the incumbrance of baggage; but it is unspeakable\r\nthe quantity of useless sprechery which they have collected on their\r\nmarch. I saw one fellow of yours (craving your pardon once more) with a\r\npier-glass upon his back.”\r\n\r\n“Ay,” said Fergus, still in good-humour, “he would have told you, if\r\nyou had questioned him, “a ganging foot is aye getting.” But come, my\r\ndear Baron, you know as well as I that a hundred Uhlans, or a single\r\ntroop of Schmirschitz’s Pandours, would make more havoc in a country\r\nthan the knight of the mirror and all the rest of our clans put\r\ntogether.”\r\n\r\n“And that is very true likewise,” replied the Baron; “they are, as the\r\nheathen author says, ‘ferociores in aspectu, mitiores in actu,’ ‘of a\r\nhorrid and grim visage, but more benign in demeanour than their\r\nphysiognomy or aspect might infer.’ But I stand here talking to you two\r\nyoungsters when I should be in the King’s Park.”\r\n\r\n“But you will dine with Waverley and me on your return? I assure you,\r\nBaron, though I can live like a Highlander when needs must, I remember\r\nmy Paris education, and understand perfectly _faire la meilleure\r\nchère_.”\r\n\r\n“And wha the deil doubts it,” quoth the Baron, laughing, “when ye bring\r\nonly the cookery and the gude toun must furnish the materials? Weel, I\r\nhave some business in the toun too; but I’ll join you at three, if the\r\nvivers can tarry so long.”\r\n\r\nSo saying, he took leave of his friends and went to look after the\r\ncharge which had been assigned him.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIII.\r\nA SOLDIER’S DINNER\r\n\r\n\r\nJames of the Needle was a man of his word when whisky was no party to\r\nthe contract; and upon this occasion Callum Beg, who still thought\r\nhimself in Waverley’s debt, since he had declined accepting\r\ncompensation at the expense of mine host of the Candlestick’s person,\r\ntook the opportunity of discharging the obligation, by mounting guard\r\nover the hereditary tailor of Sliochd nan Ivor; and, as he expressed\r\nhimself, “targed him tightly” till the finishing of the job. To rid\r\nhimself of this restraint, Shemus’s needle flew through the tartan like\r\nlightning; and as the artist kept chanting some dreadful skirmish of\r\nFin Macoul, he accomplished at least three stitches to the death of\r\nevery hero. The dress was, therefore, soon ready, for the short coat\r\nfitted the wearer, and the rest of the apparel required little\r\nadjustment.\r\n\r\nOur hero having now fairly assumed the “garb of old Gaul,” well\r\ncalculated as it was to give an appearance of strength to a figure\r\nwhich, though tall and well-made, was rather elegant than robust, I\r\nhope my fair readers will excuse him if he looked at himself in the\r\nmirror more than once, and could not help acknowledging that the\r\nreflection seemed that of a very handsome young fellow. In fact, there\r\nwas no disguising it. His light-brown hair—for he wore no periwig,\r\nnotwithstanding the universal fashion of the time—became the bonnet\r\nwhich surmounted it. His person promised firmness and agility, to which\r\nthe ample folds of the tartan added an air of dignity. His blue eye\r\nseemed of that kind,\r\n\r\nWhich melted in love, and which kindled in war;\r\n\r\n\r\nand an air of bashfulness, which was in reality the effect of want of\r\nhabitual intercourse with the world, gave interest to his features,\r\nwithout injuring their grace or intelligence.\r\n\r\n“He’s a pratty man, a very pratty man,” said Evan Dhu (now Ensign\r\nMaccombich) to Fergus’s buxom landlady.\r\n\r\n“He’s vera weel,” said the Widow Flockhart, “but no naething sae\r\nweel-far’d as your colonel, ensign.”\r\n\r\n“I was na comparing them,” quoth Evan, “nor was I speaking about his\r\nbeing weel-favoured; but only that Mr. Waverley looks clean-made and\r\n_deliver_, and like a proper lad o’ his quarters, that will not cry\r\nbarley in a brulzie. And, indeed, he’s gleg aneuch at the broadsword\r\nand target. I hae played wi’ him mysell at Glennaquoich, and sae has\r\nVich Ian Vohr, often of a Sunday afternoon.”\r\n\r\n“Lord forgie ye, Ensign Maccombich,” said the alarmed Presbyterian;\r\n“I’m sure the colonel wad never do the like o’ that!”\r\n\r\n“Hout! hout! Mrs. Flockhart,” replied the ensign, “we’re young blude,\r\nye ken; and young saints, auld deils.”\r\n\r\n“But will ye fight wi’ Sir John Cope the morn, Ensign Maccombich?”\r\ndemanded Mrs. Flockhart of her guest.\r\n\r\n“Troth I’se ensure him, an he’ll bide us, Mrs. Flockhart,” replied the\r\nGael.\r\n\r\n“And will ye face thae tearing chields, the dragoons, Ensign\r\nMaccombich?” again inquired the landlady.\r\n\r\n“Claw for claw, as Conan said to Satan, Mrs. Flockhart, and the deevil\r\ntak the shortest nails.”\r\n\r\n“And will the colonel venture on the bagganets himsell?”\r\n\r\n“Ye may swear it, Mrs. Flockhart; the very first man will he be, by\r\nSaint Phedar.”\r\n\r\n“Merciful goodness! and if he’s killed amang the redcoats!” exclaimed\r\nthe soft-hearted widow.\r\n\r\n“Troth, if it should sae befall, Mrs. Flockhart, I ken ane that will no\r\nbe living to weep for him. But we maun a’ live the day, and have our\r\ndinner; and there’s Vich Ian Vohr has packed his _dorlach_, and Mr.\r\nWaverley’s wearied wi’ majoring yonder afore the muckle pier-glass; and\r\nthat grey auld stoor carle, the Baron o’ Bradwardine that shot young\r\nRonald of Ballenkeiroch, he’s coming down the close wi’ that droghling\r\ncoghling bailie body they ca’ Macwhupple, just like the Laird o’\r\nKittlegab’s French cook, wi’ his turnspit doggie trindling ahint him,\r\nand I am as hungry as a gled, my bonny dow; sae bid Kate set on the\r\nbroo’, and do ye put on your pinners, for ye ken Vich Ian Vohr winna\r\nsit down till ye be at the head o’ the table;—and dinna forget the pint\r\nbottle o’ brandy, my woman.”\r\n\r\nThis hint produced dinner. Mrs. Flockhart, smiling in her weeds like\r\nthe sun through a mist, took the head of the table, thinking within\r\nherself, perhaps, that she cared not how long the rebellion lasted that\r\nbrought her into company so much above her usual associates. She was\r\nsupported by Waverley and the Baron, with the advantage of the\r\nchieftain _vis-à-vis_. The men of peace and of war, that is, Bailie\r\nMacwheeble and Ensign Maccombich, after many profound _congés_ to their\r\nsuperiors and each other, took their places on each side of the\r\nChieftain. Their fare was excellent, time, place, and circumstances\r\nconsidered, and Fergus’s spirits were extravagantly high. Regardless of\r\ndanger, and sanguine from temper, youth, and ambition, he saw in\r\nimagination all his prospects crowned with success, and was totally\r\nindifferent to the probable alternative of a soldier’s grave. The Baron\r\napologized slightly for bringing Macwheeble. They had been providing,\r\nhe said, for the expenses of the campaign. “And, by my faith,” said the\r\nold man, “as I think this will be my last, so I just end where I began:\r\nI hae evermore found the sinews of war, as a learned author calls the\r\n_caisse militaire_, mair difficult to come by than either its flesh,\r\nblood, or bones.”\r\n\r\n“What! have you raised our only efficient body of cavalry and got ye\r\nnone of the louis-d’or out of the Doutelle[*] to help you?”\r\n\r\n[* The Doutelle was an armed vessel which brought a small supply of\r\nmoney and arms from France for the use of the insurgents.]\r\n\r\n\r\n“No, Glennaquoich; cleverer fellows have been before me.”\r\n\r\n“That’s a scandal,” said the young Highlander; “but you will share what\r\nis left of my subsidy; it will save you an anxious thought tonight, and\r\nwill be all one tomorrow, for we shall all be provided for, one way or\r\nother, before the sun sets.” Waverley, blushing deeply, but with great\r\nearnestness, pressed the same request.\r\n\r\n“I thank ye baith, my good lads,” said the Baron, “but I will not\r\ninfringe upon your _peculium_. Bailie Macwheeble has provided the sum\r\nwhich is necessary.”\r\n\r\nHere the Bailie shifted and fidgeted about in his seat, and appeared\r\nextremely uneasy. At length, after several preliminary hems, and much\r\ntautological expression of his devotion to his honour’s service, by\r\nnight or day, living or dead, he began to insinuate, “that the banks\r\nhad removed a’ their ready cash into the Castle; that, nae doubt,\r\nSandie Goldie, the silversmith, would do mickle for his honour; but\r\nthere was little time to get the wadset made out; and, doubtless, if\r\nhis honour Glennaquoich or Mr. Wauverley could accommodate—”\r\n\r\n“Let me hear of no such nonsense, sir,” said the Baron, in a tone which\r\nrendered Macwheeble mute, “but proceed as we accorded before dinner, if\r\nit be your wish to remain in my service.”\r\n\r\nTo this peremptory order the Bailie, though he felt as if condemned to\r\nsuffer a transfusion of blood from his own veins into those of the\r\nBaron, did not presume to make any reply. After fidgeting a little\r\nwhile longer, however, he addressed himself to Glennaquoich, and told\r\nhim, if his honour had mair ready siller than was sufficient for his\r\noccasions in the field, he could put it out at use for his honour in\r\nsafe hands and at great profit at this time.\r\n\r\nAt this proposal Fergus laughed heartily, and answered, when he had\r\nrecovered his breath—“Many thanks, Bailie; but you must know, it is a\r\ngeneral custom among us soldiers to make our landlady our banker. Here,\r\nMrs. Flockhart,” said he, taking four or five broad pieces out of a\r\nwell-filled purse and tossing the purse itself, with its remaining\r\ncontents, into her apron, “these will serve my occasions; do you take\r\nthe rest. Be my banker if I live, and my executor if I die; but take\r\ncare to give something to the Highland _cailliachs_[*] that shall cry\r\nthe coronach loudest for the last Vich Ian Vohr.”\r\n\r\n[* Old women, on whom devolved the duty of lamenting for the dead,\r\nwhich the Irish call _Keening_.]\r\n\r\n\r\n“It is the _testamentum militare_,” quoth the Baron, “whilk, amang the\r\nRomans, was privilegiate to be nuncupative.” But the soft heart of Mrs.\r\nFlockhart was melted within her at the Chieftain’s speech; she set up a\r\nlamentable blubbering, and positively refused to touch the bequest,\r\nwhich Fergus was therefore obliged to resume.\r\n\r\n“Well, then,” said the Chief, “if I fall, it will go to the grenadier\r\nthat knocks my brains out, and I shall take care he works hard for it.”\r\n\r\nBailie Macwheeble was again tempted to put in his oar; for where cash\r\nwas concerned he did not willingly remain silent. “Perhaps he had\r\nbetter carry the gowd to Miss Mac-Ivor, in case of mortality or\r\naccidents of war. It might tak the form of a _mortis causa_ donation in\r\nthe young leddie’s favour, and—wad cost but the scrape of a pen to mak\r\nit out.”\r\n\r\n“The young lady,” said Fergus,” should such an event happen, will have\r\nother matters to think of than these wretched louis-d’or.”\r\n\r\n“True—undeniable—there’s nae doubt o’ that; but your honour kens that a\r\nfull sorrow—”\r\n\r\n“Is endurable by most folk more easily than a hungry one? True, Bailie,\r\nvery true; and I believe there may even be some who would be consoled\r\nby such a reflection for the loss of the whole existing generation. But\r\nthere is a sorrow which knows neither hunger nor thirst; and poor\r\nFlora—” He paused, and the whole company sympathised in his emotion.\r\n\r\nThe Baron’s thoughts naturally reverted to the unprotected state of his\r\ndaughter, and the big tear came to the veteran’s eye. “If I fall,\r\nMacwheeble, you have all my papers and know all my affairs; be just to\r\nRose.”\r\n\r\nThe Bailie was a man of earthly mould, after all; a good deal of dirt\r\nand dross about him, undoubtedly, but some kindly and just feelings he\r\nhad, especially where the Baron or his young mistress were concerned.\r\nHe set up a lamentable howl. “If that doleful day should come, while\r\nDuncan Macwheeble had a boddle it should be Miss Rose’s. He wald scroll\r\nfor a plack the sheet or she kenn’d what it was to want; if indeed a’\r\nthe bonnie baronie o’ Bradwardine and Tully-Veolan, with the fortalice\r\nand manor-place thereof (he kept sobbing and whining at every pause),\r\ntofts, crofts, mosses, muirs—outfield,\r\ninfield—buildings—orchards—dove-cots—with the right of net and coble in\r\nthe water and loch of Veolan—teinds, parsonage and vicarage—annexis,\r\nconnexis—rights of pasturage—feul, feal and divot—parts, pendicles, and\r\npertinents whatsoever—(here he had recourse to the end of his long\r\ncravat to wipe his eyes, which overflowed, in spite of him, at the\r\nideas which this technical jargon conjured up)—all as more fully\r\ndescribed in the proper evidents and titles thereof—and lying within\r\nthe parish of Bradwardine and the shire of Perth—if, as aforesaid, they\r\nmust a’ pass from my master’s child to Inch-Grabbit, wha’s a Whig and a\r\nHanoverian, and be managed by his doer, Jamie Howie, wha’s no fit to be\r\na birlieman, let be a bailie—”\r\n\r\nThe beginning of this lamentation really had something affecting, but\r\nthe conclusion rendered laughter irresistible. “Never mind, Bailie,”\r\nsaid Ensign Maccombich, “for the gude auld times of rugging and riving\r\n(pulling and tearing) are come back again, an’ Sneckus Mac-Snackus\r\n(meaning, probably, annexis, connexis), and a’ the rest of your\r\nfriends, maun gie place to the langest claymore.”\r\n\r\n“And that claymore shall be ours, Bailie,” said the Chieftain, who saw\r\nthat Macwheeble looked very blank at this intimation.\r\n\r\n“We’ll give them the metal our mountain affords,\r\n        Lillibulero, bullen a la,\r\nAnd in place of broad-pieces, we’ll pay with broadswords,\r\n        Lero, lero, etc.\r\nWith duns and with debts we will soon clear our score,\r\n        Lillibulero, etc.\r\nFor the man that’s thus paid will crave payment no more,\r\n        Lero, lero, etc.[*]\r\n\r\n\r\n[* These lines, or something like them, occur in an old magazine of the\r\nperiod.]\r\n\r\n\r\nBut come, Bailie, be not cast down; drink your wine with a joyous\r\nheart; the Baron shall return safe and victorious to Tully-Veolan, and\r\nunite Killancureit’s lairdship with his own, since the cowardly\r\nhalf-bred swine will not turn out for the Prince like a gentleman.”\r\n\r\n“To be sure, they lie maist ewest,”[*] said the Bailie, wiping his\r\neyes, “and should naturally fa’ under the same factory.”\r\n\r\n[* That is, contiguous.]\r\n\r\n\r\n“And I,” proceeded the Chieftain, “shall take care of myself, too; for\r\nyou must know, I have to complete a good work here, by bringing Mrs.\r\nFlockhart into the bosom of the Catholic church, or at least half way,\r\nand that is to your Episcopal meeting-house. O Baron! if you heard her\r\nfine counter-tenor admonishing Kate and Matty in the morning, you, who\r\nunderstand music, would tremble at the idea of hearing her shriek in\r\nthe psalmody of Haddo’s Hole.”\r\n\r\n“Lord forgie you, colonel, how ye rin on! But I hope your honours will\r\ntak tea before ye gang to the palace, and I maun gang and mask it for\r\nyou.”\r\n\r\nSo saying, Mrs. Flockhart left the gentlemen to their own conversation,\r\nwhich, as might be supposed, turned chiefly upon the approaching events\r\nof the campaign.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIV.\r\nTHE BALL\r\n\r\n\r\nEnsign MacCombich having gone to the Highland camp upon duty, and\r\nBailie Macwheeble having retired to digest his dinner and Evan Dhu’s\r\nintimation of martial law in some blind change-house, Waverley, with\r\nthe Baron and the Chieftain, proceeded to Holyrood House. The two last\r\nwere in full tide of spirits, and the Baron rallied in his way our hero\r\nupon the handsome figure which his new dress displayed to advantage.\r\n“If you have any design upon the heart of a bonny Scotch lassie, I\r\nwould premonish you, when you address her, to remember and quote the\r\nwords of Virgilius:—\r\n\r\nNunc insanus amor duri me Martis in armis,\r\nTela inter media atque adversos detinet hostes;\r\n\r\n\r\nwhilk verses Robertson of Struan, Chief of the Clan Donnochy (unless\r\nthe claims of Lude ought to be preferred _primo loco_), has thus\r\nelegantly rendered:—\r\n\r\nFor cruel love had gartan’d low my leg,\r\nAnd clad my hurdies in a philabeg.\r\n\r\n\r\nalthough, indeed, ye wear the trews, a garment whilk I approve maist of\r\nthe twa, as mair ancient and seemly.”\r\n\r\n“Or rather,” said Fergus, “hear my song:—\r\n\r\nShe wadna hae a Lowland laird,\r\n    Nor be an English lady;\r\nBut she’s away with Duncan Grame,\r\n    And he’s row’d her in his plaidy.”\r\n\r\n\r\nBy this time they reached the palace of Holyrood, and were announced\r\nrespectively as they entered the apartments.\r\n\r\nIt is but too well known how many gentlemen of rank, education, and\r\nfortune took a concern in the ill-fated and desperate undertaking of\r\n1745. The ladies, also, of Scotland very generally espoused the cause\r\nof the gallant and handsome young Prince, who threw himself upon the\r\nmercy of his countrymen rather like a hero of romance than a\r\ncalculating politician. It is not, therefore, to be wondered that\r\nEdward, who had spent the greater part of his life in the solemn\r\nseclusion of Waverley-Honour, should have been dazzled at the\r\nliveliness and elegance of the scene now exhibited in the long deserted\r\nhalls of the Scottish palace. The accompaniments, indeed, fell short of\r\nsplendour, being such as the confusion and hurry of the time admitted;\r\nstill, however, the general effect was striking, and, the rank of the\r\ncompany considered, might well be called brilliant.\r\n\r\nIt was not long before the lover’s eye discovered the object of his\r\nattachment. Flora Mac-Ivor was in the act of returning to her seat,\r\nnear the top of the room, with Rose Bradwardine by her side. Among much\r\nelegance and beauty, they had attracted a great degree of the public\r\nattention, being certainly two of the handsomest women present. The\r\nPrince took much notice of both, particularly of Flora, with whom he\r\ndanced, a preference which she probably owed to her foreign education\r\nand command of the French and Italian languages.\r\n\r\nWhen the bustle attending the conclusion of the dance permitted, Edward\r\nalmost intuitively followed Fergus to the place where Miss Mac-Ivor was\r\nseated. The sensation of hope with which he had nursed his affection in\r\nabsence of the beloved object seemed to vanish in her presence, and,\r\nlike one striving to recover the particulars of a forgotten dream, he\r\nwould have given the world at that moment to have recollected the\r\ngrounds on which he had founded expectations which now seemed so\r\ndelusive. He accompanied Fergus with downcast eyes, tingling ears, and\r\nthe feelings of the criminal who, while the melancholy cart moves\r\nslowly through the crowds that have assembled to behold his execution,\r\nreceives no clear sensation either from the noise which fills his ears\r\nor the tumult on which he casts his wandering look. Flora seemed a\r\nlittle—a very little—affected and discomposed at his approach. “I bring\r\nyou an adopted son of Ivor,” said Fergus.\r\n\r\n“And I receive him as a second brother,” replied Flora.\r\n\r\nThere was a slight emphasis on the word, which would have escaped every\r\near but one that was feverish with apprehension. It was, however,\r\ndistinctly marked, and, combined with her whole tone and manner,\r\nplainly intimated, “I will never think of Mr. Waverley as a more\r\nintimate connexion.” Edward stopped, bowed, and looked at Fergus, who\r\nbit his lip, a movement of anger which proved that he also had put a\r\nsinister interpretation on the reception which his sister had given his\r\nfriend. “This, then, is an end of my day-dream!” Such was Waverley’s\r\nfirst thought, and it was so exquisitely painful as to banish from his\r\ncheek every drop of blood.\r\n\r\n“Good God!” said Rose Bradwardine, “he is not yet recovered!”\r\n\r\nThese words, which she uttered with great emotion, were overheard by\r\nthe Chevalier himself, who stepped hastily forward, and, taking\r\nWaverley by the hand, inquired kindly after his health, and added that\r\nhe wished to speak with him. By a strong and sudden effort; which the\r\ncircumstances rendered indispensable, Waverley recovered himself so far\r\nas to follow the Chevalier in silence to a recess in the apartment.\r\n\r\nHere the Prince detained him some time, asking various questions about\r\nthe great Tory and Catholic families of England, their connections,\r\ntheir influence, and the state of their affections towards the house of\r\nStuart. To these queries Edward could not at any time have given more\r\nthan general answers, and it may be supposed that, in the present state\r\nof his feelings, his responses were indistinct even to confusion. The\r\nChevalier smiled once or twice at the incongruity of his replies, but\r\ncontinued the same style of conversation, although he found himself\r\nobliged to occupy the principal share of it, until he perceived that\r\nWaverley had recovered his presence of mind. It is probable that this\r\nlong audience was partly meant to further the idea which the Prince\r\ndesired should be entertained among his followers, that Waverley was a\r\ncharacter of political influence. But it appeared, from his concluding\r\nexpressions, that he had a different and good-natured motive, personal\r\nto our hero, for prolonging the conference. “I cannot resist the\r\ntemptation,” he said, “of boasting of my own discretion as a lady’s\r\nconfidant. You see, Mr. Waverley, that I know all, and I assure you I\r\nam deeply interested in the affair. But, my good young friend, you must\r\nput a more severe restraint upon your feelings. There are many here\r\nwhose eyes can see as clearly as mine, but the prudence of whose\r\ntongues may not be equally trusted.”\r\n\r\nSo saying, he turned easily away and joined a circle of officers at a\r\nfew paces’ distance, leaving Waverley to meditate upon his parting\r\nexpression, which, though not intelligible to him in its whole purport,\r\nwas sufficiently so in the caution which the last word recommended.\r\nMaking, therefore, an effort to show himself worthy of the interest\r\nwhich his new master had expressed, by instant obedience to his\r\nrecommendation, he walked up to the spot where Flora and Miss\r\nBradwardine were still seated, and having made his compliments to the\r\nlatter, he succeeded, even beyond his own expectation, in entering into\r\nconversation upon general topics.\r\n\r\nIf, my dear reader, thou hast ever happened to take post-horses at ——\r\nor at —— (one at least of which blanks, or more probably both, you will\r\nbe able to fill up from an inn near your own residence), you must have\r\nobserved, and doubtless with sympathetic pain, the reluctant agony with\r\nwhich the poor jades at first apply their galled necks to the collars\r\nof the harness. But when the irresistible arguments of the post-boy\r\nhave prevailed upon them to proceed a mile or two, they will become\r\ncallous to the first sensation; and being warm in the harness, as the\r\nsaid post-boy may term it, proceed as if their withers were altogether\r\nunwrung. This simile so much corresponds with the state of Waverley’s\r\nfeelings in the course of this memorable evening, that I prefer it\r\n(especially as being, I trust, wholly original) to any more splendid\r\nillustration with which Byshe’s “Art of Poetry” might supply me.\r\n\r\nExertion, like virtue, is its own reward; and our hero had, moreover,\r\nother stimulating motives for persevering in a display of affected\r\ncomposure and indifference to Flora’s obvious unkindness. Pride, which\r\nsupplies its caustic as an useful, though severe, remedy for the wounds\r\nof affection, came rapidly to his aid. Distinguished by the favour of a\r\nprince; destined, he had room to hope, to play a conspicuous part in\r\nthe revolution which awaited a mighty kingdom; excelling, probably, in\r\nmental acquirements, and equalling at least in personal\r\naccomplishments, most of the noble and distinguished persons with whom\r\nhe was now ranked; young, wealthy, and high-born,—could he, or ought\r\nhe, to droop beneath the frown of a capricious beauty?\r\n\r\nO nymph, unrelenting and cold as thou art,\r\nMy bosom is proud as thine own.\r\n\r\n\r\nWith the feeling expressed in these beautiful lines (which, however,\r\nwere not then written),[*] Waverley determined upon convincing Flora\r\nthat he was not to be depressed by a rejection in which his vanity\r\nwhispered that perhaps she did her own prospects as much injustice as\r\nhis. And, to aid this change of feeling, there lurked the secret and\r\nunacknowledged hope that she might learn to prize his affection more\r\nhighly, when she did not conceive it to be altogether within her own\r\nchoice to attract or repulse it. There was a mystic tone of\r\nencouragement, also, in the Chevalier’s words, though he feared they\r\nonly referred to the wishes of Fergus in favour of an union between him\r\nand his sister. But the whole circumstances of time, place, and\r\nincident combined at once to awaken his imagination and to call upon\r\nhim for a manly and decisive tone of conduct, leaving to fate to\r\ndispose of the issue. Should he appear to be the only one sad and\r\ndisheartened on the eve of battle, how greedily would the tale be\r\ncommented upon by the slander which had been already but too busy with\r\nhis fame! Never, never, he internally resolved, shall my unprovoked\r\nenemies possess such an advantage over my reputation.\r\n\r\n[* They occur in Miss Seward’s fine verses, beginning—\r\n“To thy rocks, stormy Lannow, adieu.”]\r\n\r\n\r\nUnder the influence of these mixed sensations, and cheered at times by\r\na smile of intelligence and approbation from the Prince as he passed\r\nthe group, Waverley exerted his powers of fancy, animation, and\r\neloquence, and attracted the general admiration of the company. The\r\nconversation gradually assumed the tone best qualified for the display\r\nof his talents and acquisitions. The gaiety of the evening was exalted\r\nin character, rather than checked, by the approaching dangers of the\r\nmorrow. All nerves were strung for the future, and prepared to enjoy\r\nthe present. This mood of mind is highly favourable for the exercise of\r\nthe powers of imagination, for poetry, and for that eloquence which is\r\nallied to poetry. Waverley, as we have elsewhere observed, possessed at\r\ntimes a wonderful flow of rhetoric; and on the present occasion, he\r\ntouched more than once the higher notes of feeling, and then again ran\r\noff in a wild voluntary of fanciful mirth. He was supported and excited\r\nby kindred spirits, who felt the same impulse of mood and time; and\r\neven those of more cold and calculating habits were hurried along by\r\nthe torrent. Many ladies declined the dance, which still went forward,\r\nand under various pretences joined the party to which the “handsome\r\nyoung Englishman” seemed to have attached himself. He was presented to\r\nseveral of the first rank, and his manners, which for the present were\r\naltogether free from the bashful restraint by which, in a moment of\r\nless excitation, they were usually clouded, gave universal delight.\r\n\r\nFlora Mac-Ivor appeared to be the only female present who regarded him\r\nwith a degree of coldness and reserve; yet even she could not suppress\r\na sort of wonder at talents which, in the course of their acquaintance,\r\nshe had never seen displayed with equal brilliancy and impressive\r\neffect. I do not know whether she might not feel a momentary regret at\r\nhaving taken so decisive a resolution upon the addresses of a lover who\r\nseemed fitted so well to fill a high place in the highest stations of\r\nsociety. Certainly she had hitherto accounted among the incurable\r\ndeficiencies of Edward’s disposition the _mauvaise honte_ which, as she\r\nhad been educated in the first foreign circles, and was little\r\nacquainted with the shyness of English manners, was in her opinion too\r\nnearly related to timidity and imbecility of disposition. But if a\r\npassing wish occurred that Waverley could have rendered himself\r\nuniformly thus amiable and attractive, its influence was momentary; for\r\ncircumstances had arisen since they met which rendered in her eyes the\r\nresolution she had formed respecting him final and irrevocable.\r\n\r\nWith opposite feelings Rose Bradwardine bent her whole soul to listen.\r\nShe felt a secret triumph at the public tribute paid to one whose merit\r\nshe had learned to prize too early and too fondly. Without a thought of\r\njealousy, without a feeling of fear, pain, or doubt, and undisturbed by\r\na single selfish consideration, she resigned herself to the pleasure of\r\nobserving the general murmur of applause. When Waverley spoke, her ear\r\nwas exclusively filled with his voice, when others answered, her eye\r\ntook its turn of observation, and seemed to watch his reply. Perhaps\r\nthe delight which she experienced in the course of that evening, though\r\ntransient, and followed by much sorrow, was in its nature the most pure\r\nand disinterested which the human mind is capable of enjoying.\r\n\r\n“Baron,” said the Chevalier, “I would not trust my mistress in the\r\ncompany of your young friend. He is really, though perhaps somewhat\r\nromantic, one of the most fascinating young men whom I have ever seen.”\r\n\r\n“And by my honour, sir,” replied the Baron, “the lad can sometimes be\r\nas dowff as a sexagenary like myself. If your Royal Highness had seen\r\nhim dreaming and dozing about the banks of Tully-Veolan like an\r\nhypochondriac person, or, as Burton’s “Anatomia” hath it, a phrenesiac\r\nor lethargic patient, you would wonder where he hath sae suddenly\r\nacquired all this fine sprack festivity and jocularity.”\r\n\r\n“Truly,” said Fergus Mac-Ivor, “I think it can only be the inspiration\r\nof the tartans; for, though Waverley be always a young fellow of sense\r\nand honour, I have hitherto often found him a very absent and\r\ninattentive companion.”\r\n\r\n“We are the more obliged to him,” said the Prince, “for having reserved\r\nfor this evening qualities which even such intimate friends had not\r\ndiscovered. But come, gentlemen, the night advances, and the business\r\nof tomorrow must be early thought upon. Each take charge of his fair\r\npartner, and honour a small refreshment with your company.”\r\n\r\nHe led the way to another suite of apartments, and assumed the seat and\r\ncanopy at the head of a long range of tables with an air of dignity,\r\nmingled with courtesy, which well became his high birth and lofty\r\npretensions. An hour had hardly flown away when the musicians played\r\nthe signal for parting so well known in Scotland.[*]\r\n\r\n[* Which is, or was wont to be, the old air of “Good-night and joy be\r\nwi’ you a’!”]\r\n\r\n\r\n“Good-night, then,” said the Chevalier, rising; “goodnight, and joy be\r\nwith you! Good-night, fair ladies, who have so highly honoured a\r\nproscribed and banished Prince! Good-night, my brave friends; may the\r\nhappiness we have this evening experienced be an omen of our return to\r\nthese our paternal halls, speedily and in triumph, and of many and many\r\nfuture meetings of mirth and pleasure in the palace of Holyrood!”\r\n\r\nWhen the Baron of Bradwardine afterwards mentioned this adieu of the\r\nChevalier, he never failed to repeat, in a melancholy tone,\r\n\r\n“Audiit, et voti Phœbus succedere partem\r\nMente dedit; partem volucres dispersit in auras;\r\n\r\n\r\nwhich,” as he added, “is weel rendered into English metre by my friend\r\nBangour:—\r\n\r\nAe half the prayer wi’ Phœbus grace did find,\r\nThe t’other half he whistled down the wind.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XV.\r\nTHE MARCH\r\n\r\n\r\nThe conflicting passions and exhausted feelings of Waverley had\r\nresigned him to late but sound repose. He was dreaming of Glennaquoich,\r\nand had transferred to the halls of Ian nan Chaistel the festal train\r\nwhich so lately graced those of Holyrood. The pibroch too was\r\ndistinctly heard; and this at least was no delusion, for the “proud\r\nstep of the chief piper” of the “chlain Mac-Ivor” was perambulating the\r\ncourt before the door of his Chieftain’s quarters, and as Mrs.\r\nFlockhart, apparently no friend to his minstrelsy, was pleased to\r\nobserve, “garring the very stane-and-lime wa’s dingle wi’ his\r\nscreeching.” Of course it soon became too powerful for Waverley’s\r\ndream, with which it had at first rather harmonised.\r\n\r\nThe sound of Callum’s brogues in his apartment (for Mac-Ivor had again\r\nassigned Waverley to his care) was the next note of parting. “Winna yer\r\nhonour bang up? Vich Ian Vohr and ta Prince are awa to the lang green\r\nglen ahint the clachan, tat they ca’ the King’s Park,[*] and mony ane’s\r\non his ain shanks the day that will be carried on ither folk’s ere\r\nnight.”\r\n\r\n[* The main body of the Highland army encamped, or rather bivouacked,\r\nin that part of the King’s Park which lies towards the village of\r\nDuddingston.]\r\n\r\n\r\nWaverley sprung up, and, with Callum’s assistance and instructions,\r\nadjusted his tartans in proper costume. Callum told him also, “tat his\r\nleather _dorlach_ wi’ the lock on her was come frae Doune, and she was\r\nawa again in the wain wi’ Vich Ian Vohr’s walise.”\r\n\r\nBy this periphrasis Waverley readily apprehended his portmanteau was\r\nintended. He thought upon the mysterious packet of the maid of the\r\ncavern, which seemed always to escape him when within his very grasp.\r\nBut this was no time for indulgence of curiosity; and having declined\r\nMrs. Flockhart’s compliment of a _morning_, _i.e._ a matutinal dram,\r\nbeing probably the only man in the Chevalier’s army by whom such a\r\ncourtesy would have been rejected, he made his adieus and departed with\r\nCallum.\r\n\r\n“Callum,” said he, as they proceeded down a dirty close to gain the\r\nsouthern skirts of the Canongate, “what shall I do for a horse?”\r\n\r\n“Ta deil ane ye maun think o’,” said Callum. “Vich Ian Vohr’s marching\r\non foot at the head o’ his kin (not to say ta Prince, wha does the\r\nlike), wi’ his target on his shoulder; and ye maun e’en be\r\nneighbour-like.”\r\n\r\n“And so I will, Callum, give me my target; so, there we are fixed. How\r\ndoes it look?”\r\n\r\n“Like the bra’ Highlander tat’s painted on the board afore the mickle\r\nchange-house they ca’ Luckie Middlemass’s,” answered Callum; meaning, I\r\nmust observe, a high compliment, for in his opinion Luckie Middlemass’s\r\nsign was an exquisite specimen of art. Waverley, however, not feeling\r\nthe full force of this polite simile, asked him no further questions.\r\n\r\nUpon extricating themselves from the mean and dirty suburbs of the\r\nmetropolis, and emerging into the open air, Waverley felt a renewal of\r\nboth health and spirits, and turned his recollection with firmness upon\r\nthe events of the preceding evening, and with hope and resolution\r\ntowards those of the approaching day.\r\n\r\nWhen he had surmounted a small craggy eminence called St. Leonard’s\r\nHill, the King’s Park, or the hollow between the mountain of Arthur’s\r\nSeat and the rising grounds on which the southern part of Edinburgh is\r\nnow built, lay beneath him, and displayed a singular and animating\r\nprospect. It was occupied by the army of the Highlanders, now in the\r\nact of preparing for their march. Waverley had already seen something\r\nof the kind at the hunting-match which he attended with Fergus\r\nMac-Ivor; but this was on a scale of much greater magnitude, and\r\nincomparably deeper interest. The rocks, which formed the background of\r\nthe scene, and the very sky itself, rang with the clang of the\r\nbagpipers, summoning forth, each with his appropriate pibroch, his\r\nchieftain and clan. The mountaineers, rousing themselves from their\r\ncouch under the canopy of heaven with the hum and bustle of a confused\r\nand irregular multitude, like bees alarmed and arming in their hives,\r\nseemed to possess all the pliability of movement fitted to execute\r\nmilitary manœuvres. Their motions appeared spontaneous and confused,\r\nbut the result was order and regularity; so that a general must have\r\npraised the conclusion, though a martinet might have ridiculed the\r\nmethod by which it was attained.\r\n\r\nThe sort of complicated medley created by the hasty arrangements of the\r\nvarious clans under their respective banners, for the purpose of\r\ngetting into the order of march, was in itself a gay and lively\r\nspectacle. They had no tents to strike having generally, and by choice,\r\nslept upon the open field, although the autumn was now waning and the\r\nnights began to be frosty. For a little space, while they were getting\r\ninto order, there was exhibited a changing, fluctuating, and confused\r\nappearance of waving tartans and floating plumes, and of banners\r\ndisplaying the proud gathering word of Clanronald, Ganion Coheriga\r\n(Gainsay who dares), Loch-Sloy, the watchword of the MacFarlanes;\r\nForth, fortune, and fill the fetters, the motto of the Marquis of\r\nTullibardine; Bydand, that of Lord Lewis Gordon, and the appropriate\r\nsignal words and emblems of many other chieftains and clans.\r\n\r\nAt length the mixed and wavering multitude arranged themselves into a\r\nnarrow and dusky column of great length, stretching through the whole\r\nextent of the valley. In the front of the column the standard of the\r\nChevalier was displayed, bearing a red cross upon a white ground, with\r\nthe motto Tandem Triumphans. The few cavalry, being chiefly Lowland\r\ngentry, with their domestic servants and retainers, formed the advanced\r\nguard of the army; and their standards, of which they had rather too\r\nmany in respect of their numbers, were seen waving upon the extreme\r\nverge of the horizon. Many horsemen of this body, among whom Waverley\r\naccidentally remarked Balmawhapple and his lieutenant, Jinker (which\r\nlast, however, had been reduced, with several others, by the advice of\r\nthe Baron of Bradwardine, to the situation of what he called reformed\r\nofficers, or reformadoes), added to the liveliness, though by no means\r\nto the regularity, of the scene, by galloping their horses as fast\r\nforward as the press would permit, to join their proper station in the\r\nvan. The fascinations of the Circes of the High Street, and the\r\npotations of strength with which they had been drenched over night, had\r\nprobably detained these heroes within the walls of Edinburgh somewhat\r\nlater than was consistent with their morning duty. Of such loiterers,\r\nthe prudent took the longer and circuitous, but more open, route to\r\nattain their place in the march, by keeping at some distance from the\r\ninfantry, and making their way through the inclosures to the right, at\r\nthe expense of leaping over or pulling down the drystone fences. The\r\nirregular appearance and vanishing of these small parties of horsemen,\r\nas well as the confusion occasioned by those who endeavoured, though\r\ngenerally without effect, to press to the front through the crowd of\r\nHighlanders, maugre their curses, oaths, and opposition, added to the\r\npicturesque wildness what it took from the military regularity of the\r\nscene.\r\n\r\nWhile Waverley gazed upon this remarkable spectacle, rendered yet more\r\nimpressive by the occasional discharge of cannon-shot from the Castle\r\nat the Highland guards as they were withdrawn from its vicinity to join\r\ntheir main body, Callum, with his usual freedom of interference,\r\nreminded him that Vich Ian Vohr’s folk were nearly at the head of the\r\ncolumn of march which was still distant, and that “they would gang very\r\nfast after the cannon fired.” Thus admonished, Waverley walked briskly\r\nforward, yet often casting a glance upon the darksome clouds of\r\nwarriors who were collected before and beneath him. A nearer view,\r\nindeed, rather diminished the effect impressed on the mind by the more\r\ndistant appearance of the army. The leading men of each clan were well\r\narmed with broad-sword, target, and fusee, to which all added the dirk,\r\nand most the steel pistol. But these consisted of gentlemen, that is,\r\nrelations of the chief, however distant, and who had an immediate title\r\nto his countenance and protection. Finer and hardier men could not have\r\nbeen selected out of any army in Christendom; while the free and\r\nindependent habits which each possessed, and which each was yet so well\r\ntaught to subject to the command of his chief, and the peculiar mode of\r\ndiscipline adopted in Highland warfare, rendered them equally\r\nformidable by their individual courage and high spirit, and from their\r\nrational conviction of the necessity of acting in unison, and of giving\r\ntheir national mode of attack the fullest opportunity of success.\r\n\r\nBut, in a lower rank to these, there were found individuals of an\r\ninferior description, the common peasantry of the Highland country,\r\nwho, although they did not allow themselves to be so called, and\r\nclaimed often, with apparent truth, to be of more ancient descent than\r\nthe masters whom they served, bore, nevertheless, the livery of extreme\r\npenury, being indifferently accoutred, and worse armed, half naked,\r\nstinted in growth, and miserable in aspect. Each important clan had\r\nsome of those Helots attached to them: thus, the MacCouls, though\r\ntracing their descent from Comhal, the father of Finn or Fingal, were a\r\nsort of Gibeonites, or hereditary servants to the Stewarts of Appin;\r\nthe Macbeths, descended from the unhappy monarch of that name, were\r\nsubjects to the Morays and clan Donnochy, or Robertsons of Athole; and\r\nmany other examples might be given, were it not for the risk of hurting\r\nany pride of clanship which may yet be left, and thereby drawing a\r\nHighland tempest into the shop of my publisher. Now these same Helots,\r\nthough forced into the field by the arbitrary authority of the\r\nchieftains under whom they hewed wood and drew water, were in general\r\nvery sparingly fed, ill dressed, and worse armed. The latter\r\ncircumstance was indeed owing chiefly to the general disarming act,\r\nwhich had been carried into effect ostensibly through the whole\r\nHighlands, although most of the chieftains contrived to elude its\r\ninfluence by retaining the weapons of their own immediate clansmen, and\r\ndelivering up those of less value, which they collected from these\r\ninferior satellites. It followed, as a matter of course, that, as we\r\nhave already hinted, many of these poor fellows were brought to the\r\nfield in a very wretched condition.\r\n\r\nFrom this it happened that, in bodies, the van of which were admirably\r\nwell armed in their own fashion, the rear resembled actual banditti.\r\nHere was a pole-axe, there a sword without a scabbard; here a gun\r\nwithout a lock, there a scythe set straight upon a pole; and some had\r\nonly their dirks, and bludgeons or stakes pulled out of hedges. The\r\ngrim, uncombed, and wild appearance of these men, most of whom gazed\r\nwith all the admiration of ignorance upon the most ordinary productions\r\nof domestic art, created surprise in the Lowlands, but it also created\r\nterror. So little was the condition of the Highlands known at that late\r\nperiod that the character and appearance of their population, while\r\nthus sallying forth as military adventurers, conveyed to the\r\nSouth-Country Lowlanders as much surprise as if an invasion of African\r\nNegroes or Esquimaux Indians had issued forth from the northern\r\nmountains of their own native country. It cannot therefore be wondered\r\nif Waverley, who had hitherto judged of the Highlanders generally from\r\nthe samples which the policy of Fergus had from time to time exhibited,\r\nshould have felt damped and astonished at the daring attempt of a body\r\nnot then exceeding four thousand men, and of whom not above half the\r\nnumber, at the utmost, were armed, to change the fate and alter the\r\ndynasty of the British kingdoms.\r\n\r\nAs he moved along the column, which still remained stationary, an iron\r\ngun, the only piece of artillery possessed by the army which meditated\r\nso important a revolution, was fired as the signal of march. The\r\nChevalier had expressed a wish to leave this useless piece of ordnance\r\nbehind him; but, to his surprise, the Highland chiefs interposed to\r\nsolicit that it might accompany their march, pleading the prejudices of\r\ntheir followers, who, little accustomed to artillery, attached a degree\r\nof absurd importance to this field-piece, and expected it would\r\ncontribute essentially to a victory which they could only owe to their\r\nown muskets and broadswords. Two or three French artillerymen were\r\ntherefore appointed to the management of this military engine, which\r\nwas drawn along by a string of Highland ponies, and was, after all,\r\nonly used for the purpose of firing signals.[31]\r\n\r\nNo sooner was its voice heard upon the present occasion than the whole\r\nline was in motion. A wild cry of joy from the advancing batallions\r\nrent the air, and was then lost in the shrill clangour of the bagpipes,\r\nas the sound of these, in their turn, was partially drowned by the\r\nheavy tread of so many men put at once into motion. The banners\r\nglittered and shook as they moved forward, and the horse hastened to\r\noccupy their station as the advanced guard, and to push on\r\nreconnoitring parties to ascertain and report the motions of the enemy.\r\nThey vanished from Waverley’s eye as they wheeled round the base of\r\nArthur’s Seat, under the remarkable ridge of basaltic rocks which\r\nfronts the little lake of Duddingston.\r\n\r\nThe infantry followed in the same direction, regulating their pace by\r\nanother body which occupied a road more to the southward. It cost\r\nEdward some exertion of activity to attain the place which Fergus’s\r\nfollowers occupied in the line of march.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVI.\r\nAN INCIDENT GIVES RISE TO UNAVAILING REFLECTIONS\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen Waverley reached that part of the column which was filled by the\r\nclan of Mac-Ivor, they halted, formed, and received him with a\r\ntriumphant flourish upon the bagpipes and a loud shout of the men, most\r\nof whom knew him personally, and were delighted to see him in the dress\r\nof their country and of their sept. “You shout,” said a Highlander of a\r\nneighbouring clan to Evan Dhu, “as if the Chieftain were just come to\r\nyour head.”\r\n\r\n“Mar e Bran is e a brathair, (If it be not Bran, it is Bran’s\r\nbrother),” was the proverbial reply of Maccombich.[*]\r\n\r\n[* Bran, the well-known dog of Fingal, is often the theme of Highland\r\nproverb as well as song.]\r\n\r\n\r\n“O, then, it is the handsome Sassenach Duinhé-wassel that is to be\r\nmarried to Lady Flora?”\r\n\r\n“That may be, or it may not be; and it is neither your matter nor mine,\r\nGregor.”\r\n\r\nFergus advanced to embrace the volunteer, and afford him a warm and\r\nhearty welcome; but he thought it necessary to apologize for the\r\ndiminished numbers of his battalion (which did not exceed three hundred\r\nmen) by observing he had sent a good many out upon parties.\r\n\r\nThe real fact, however, was, that the defection of Donald Bean Lean had\r\ndeprived him of at least thirty hardy fellows, whose services he had\r\nfully reckoned upon, and that many of his occasional adherents had been\r\nrecalled by their several chiefs to the standards to which they most\r\nproperly owed their allegiance. The rival chief of the great northern\r\nbranch, also, of his own clan had mustered his people, although he had\r\nnot yet declared either for the government or for the Chevalier, and by\r\nhis intrigues had in some degree diminished the force with which Fergus\r\ntook the field. To make amends for these disappointments, it was\r\nuniversally admitted that the followers of Vich Ian Vohr, in point of\r\nappearance, equipment, arms, and dexterity in using them, equalled the\r\nmost choice troops which followed the standard of Charles Edward. Old\r\nBallenkeiroch acted as his major; and, with the other officers who had\r\nknown Waverley when at Glennaquoich, gave our hero a cordial reception,\r\nas the sharer of their future dangers and expected honours.\r\n\r\nThe route pursued by the Highland army, after leaving the village of\r\nDuddingston, was for some time the common post-road betwixt Edinburgh\r\nand Haddington, until they crossed the Esk at Musselburgh, when,\r\ninstead of keeping the low grounds towards the sea, they turned more\r\ninland, and occupied the brow of the eminence called Carberry Hill, a\r\nplace already distinguished in Scottish history as the spot where the\r\nlovely Mary surrendered herself to her insurgent subjects. This\r\ndirection was chosen because the Chevalier had received notice that the\r\narmy of the government, arriving by sea from Aberdeen, had landed at\r\nDunbar, and quartered the night before to the west of Haddington, with\r\nthe intention of falling down towards the sea-side, and approaching\r\nEdinburgh by the lower coast-road. By keeping the height, which\r\noverhung that road in many places, it was hoped the Highlanders might\r\nfind an opportunity of attacking them to advantage. The army therefore\r\nhalted upon the ridge of Carberry Hill, both to refresh the soldiers\r\nand as a central situation from which their march could be directed to\r\nany point that the motions of the enemy might render most advisable.\r\nWhile they remained in this position a messenger arrived in haste to\r\ndesire Mac-Ivor to come to the Prince, adding that their advanced post\r\nhad had a skirmish with some of the enemy’s cavalry, and that the Baron\r\nof Bradwardine had sent in a few prisoners.\r\n\r\nWaverley walked forward out of the line to satisfy his curiosity, and\r\nsoon observed five or six of the troopers who, covered with dust, had\r\ngalloped in to announce that the enemy were in full march westward\r\nalong the coast. Passing still a little farther on, he was struck with\r\na groan which issued from a hovel. He approached the spot, and heard a\r\nvoice, in the provincial English of his native county, which\r\nendeavoured, though frequently interrupted by pain, to repeat the\r\nLord’s Prayer. The voice of distress always found a ready answer in our\r\nhero’s bosom. He entered the hovel, which seemed to be intended for\r\nwhat is called, in the pastoral counties of Scotland, a smearing-house;\r\nand in its obscurity Edward could only at first discern a sort of red\r\nbundle; for those who had stripped the wounded man of his arms and part\r\nof his clothes had left him the dragoon-cloak in which he was\r\nenveloped.\r\n\r\n“For the love of God,” said the wounded man, as he heard Waverley’s\r\nstep, “give me a single drop of water!”\r\n\r\n“You shall have it,” answered Waverley, at the same time raising him in\r\nhis arms, bearing him to the door of the hut, and giving him some drink\r\nfrom his flask.\r\n\r\n“I should know that voice,” said the man; but looking on Waverley’s\r\ndress with a bewildered look—“no, this is not the young squire!”\r\n\r\nThis was the common phrase by which Edward was distinguished on the\r\nestate of Waverley-Honour, and the sound now thrilled to his heart with\r\nthe thousand recollections which the well-known accents of his native\r\ncountry had already contributed to awaken. “Houghton!” he said, gazing\r\non the ghastly features which death was fast disfiguring, “can this be\r\nyou?”\r\n\r\n“I never thought to hear an English voice again,” said the wounded man;\r\n“they left me to live or die here as I could, when they found I would\r\nsay nothing about the strength of the regiment. But, O squire! how\r\ncould you stay from us so long, and let us be tempted by that fiend of\r\nthe pit, Ruffin? we should have followed you through flood and fire, to\r\nbe sure.”\r\n\r\n“Ruffin! I assure you, Houghton, you have been vilely imposed upon.”\r\n\r\n“I often thought so,” said Houghton, “though they showed us your very\r\nseal; and so Tims was shot and I was reduced to the ranks.”\r\n\r\n“Do not exhaust your strength in speaking,” said Edward; “I will get\r\nyou a surgeon presently.”\r\n\r\nHe saw Mac-Ivor approaching, who was now returning from headquarters,\r\nwhere he had attended a council of war, and hastened to meet him.\r\n“Brave news!” shouted the Chief; “we shall be at it in less than two\r\nhours. The Prince has put himself at the head of the advance, and, as\r\nhe drew his sword, called out, “My friends, I have thrown away the\r\nscabbard.” Come, Waverley, we move instantly.”\r\n\r\n“A moment—a moment; this poor prisoner is dying; where shall I find a\r\nsurgeon?”\r\n\r\n“Why, where should you? We have none, you know, but two or three French\r\nfellows, who, I believe, are little better than _garçons\r\napothicaires_.”\r\n\r\n“But the man will bleed to death.”\r\n\r\n“Poor fellow!” said Fergus, in a momentary fit of compassion; then\r\ninstantly added, “But it will be a thousand men’s fate before night; so\r\ncome along.”\r\n\r\n“I cannot; I tell you he is a son of a tenant of my uncle’s.”\r\n\r\n“O, if he’s a follower of yours he must be looked to; I’ll send Callum\r\nto you; but _diaoul! ceade millia molligheart_,” continued the\r\nimpatient Chieftain, “what made an old soldier like Bradwardine send\r\ndying men here to cumber us?”\r\n\r\nCallum came with his usual alertness; and, indeed, Waverley rather\r\ngained than lost in the opinion of the Highlanders by his anxiety about\r\nthe wounded man. They would not have understood the general\r\nphilanthropy which rendered it almost impossible for Waverley to have\r\npassed any person in such distress; but, as apprehending that the\r\nsufferer was one of his _following_ they unanimously allowed that\r\nWaverley’s conduct was that of a kind and considerate chieftain, who\r\nmerited the attachment of his people. In about a quarter of an hour\r\npoor Humphrey breathed his last, praying his young master, when he\r\nreturned to Waverley-Honour, to be kind to old Job Houghton and his\r\ndame, and conjuring him not to fight with these wild petticoat-men\r\nagainst old England.\r\n\r\nWhen his last breath was drawn, Waverley, who had beheld with sincere\r\nsorrow, and no slight tinge of remorse, the final agonies of mortality,\r\nnow witnessed for the first time, commanded Callum to remove the body\r\ninto the hut. This the young Highlander performed, not without\r\nexamining the pockets of the defunct, which, however, he remarked had\r\nbeen pretty well spunged. He took the cloak, however, and proceeding\r\nwith the provident caution of a spaniel hiding a bone, concealed it\r\namong some furze and carefully marked the spot, observing that, if he\r\nchanced to return that way, it would be an excellent rokelay for his\r\nauld mother Elspat.\r\n\r\nIt was by a considerable exertion that they regained their place in the\r\nmarching column, which was now moving rapidly forward to occupy the\r\nhigh grounds above the village of Tranent, between which and the sea\r\nlay the purposed march of the opposite army.\r\n\r\nThis melancholy interview with his late sergeant forced many unavailing\r\nand painful reflections upon Waverley’s mind. It was clear from the\r\nconfession of the man that Colonel Gardiner’s proceedings had been\r\nstrictly warranted, and even rendered indispensable, by the steps taken\r\nin Edward’s name to induce the soldiers of his troop to mutiny. The\r\ncircumstance of the seal he now, for the first time, recollected, and\r\nthat he had lost it in the cavern of the robber, Bean Lean. That the\r\nartful villain had secured it, and used it as the means of carrying on\r\nan intrigue in the regiment for his own purposes, was sufficiently\r\nevident; and Edward had now little doubt that in the packet placed in\r\nhis portmanteau by his daughter he should find farther light upon his\r\nproceedings. In the meanwhile the repeated expostulation of\r\nHoughton—“Ah, squire, why did you leave us?” rung like a knell in his\r\nears.\r\n\r\n“Yes,” he said, “I have indeed acted towards you with thoughtless\r\ncruelty. I brought you from your paternal fields, and the protection of\r\na generous and kind landlord, and when I had subjected you to all the\r\nrigour of military discipline, I shunned to bear my own share of the\r\nburden, and wandered from the duties I had undertaken, leaving alike\r\nthose whom it was my business to protect, and my own reputation, to\r\nsuffer under the artifices of villainy. O, indolence and indecision of\r\nmind, if not in yourselves vices—to how much exquisite misery and\r\nmischief do you frequently prepare the way!”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVII.\r\nTHE EVE OF BATTLE\r\n\r\n\r\nAlthough the Highlanders marched on very fast, the sun was declining\r\nwhen they arrived upon the brow of those high grounds which command an\r\nopen and extensive plain stretching northward to the sea, on which are\r\nsituated, but at a considerable distance from each other, the small\r\nvillages of Seaton and Cockenzie, and the larger one of Preston. One of\r\nthe low coastroads to Edinburgh passed through this plain, issuing upon\r\nit from the enclosures of Seaton House, and at the town or village of\r\nPreston again entering the denies of an enclosed country. By this way\r\nthe English general had chosen to approach the metropolis, both as most\r\ncommodious for his cavalry, and being probably of opinion that by doing\r\nso he would meet in front with the Highlanders advancing from Edinburgh\r\nin the opposite direction. In this he was mistaken; for the sound\r\njudgment of the Chevalier, or of those to whose advice he listened,\r\nleft the direct passage free, but occupied the strong ground by which\r\nit was overlooked and commanded.\r\n\r\nWhen the Highlanders reached the heights above the plain described,\r\nthey were immediately formed in array of battle along the brow of the\r\nhill. Almost at the same instant the van of the English appeared\r\nissuing from among the trees and enclosures of Seaton, with the purpose\r\nof occupying the level plain between the high ground and the sea; the\r\nspace which divided the armies being only about half a mile in breadth.\r\nWaverley could plainly see the squadrons of dragoons issue, one after\r\nanother, from the defiles, with their videttes in front, and form upon\r\nthe plain, with their front opposed to that of the Prince’s army. They\r\nwere followed by a train of field-pieces, which, when they reached the\r\nflank of the dragoons, were also brought into line and pointed against\r\nthe heights. The march was continued by three or four regiments of\r\ninfantry marching in open column, their fixed bayonets showing like\r\nsuccessive hedges of steel, and their arms glancing like lightning, as,\r\nat a signal given, they also at once wheeled up, and were placed in\r\ndirect opposition to the Highlanders. A second train of artillery, with\r\nanother regiment of horse, closed the long march, and formed on the\r\nleft flank of the infantry, the whole line facing southward.\r\n\r\nWhile the English army went through these evolutions, the Highlanders\r\nshowed equal promptitude and zeal for battle. As fast as the clans came\r\nupon the ridge which fronted their enemy, they were formed into line,\r\nso that both armies got into complete order of battle at the same\r\nmoment. When this was accomplished, the Highlanders set up a tremendous\r\nyell, which was re-echoed by the heights behind them. The regulars, who\r\nwere in high spirits, returned a loud shout of defiance, and fired one\r\nor two of their cannon upon an advanced post of the Highlanders. The\r\nlatter displayed great earnestness to proceed instantly to the attack,\r\nEvan Dhu urging to Fergus, by way of argument, that “the _sidier roy_\r\nwas tottering like an egg upon a staff, and that they had a’ the\r\nvantage of the onset, for even a haggis (God bless her!) could charge\r\ndown hill.”\r\n\r\nBut the ground through which the mountaineers must have descended,\r\nalthough not of great extent, was impracticable in its character, being\r\nnot only marshy but intersected with walls of dry stone, and traversed\r\nin its whole length by a very broad and deep ditch, circumstances which\r\nmust have given the musketry of the regulars dreadful advantages before\r\nthe mountaineers could have used their swords, on which they were\r\ntaught to rely. The authority of the commanders was therefore\r\ninterposed to curb the impetuosity of the Highlanders, and only a few\r\nmarksmen were sent down the descent to skirmish with the enemy’s\r\nadvanced posts and to reconnoitre the ground.\r\n\r\nHere, then, was a military spectacle of no ordinary interest or usual\r\noccurrence. The two armies, so different in aspect and discipline, yet\r\neach admirably trained in its own peculiar mode of war, upon whose\r\nconflict the temporary fate at least of Scotland appeared to depend,\r\nnow faced each other like two gladiators in the arena, each meditating\r\nupon the mode of attacking their enemy. The leading officers and the\r\ngeneral’s staff of each army could be distinguished in front of their\r\nlines, busied with spy-glasses to watch each other’s motions, and\r\noccupied in despatching the orders and receiving the intelligence\r\nconveyed by the aides-de-camp and orderly men, who gave life to the\r\nscene by galloping along in different directions, as if the fate of the\r\nday depended upon the speed of their horses. The space between the\r\narmies was at times occupied by the partial and irregular contest of\r\nindividual sharp-shooters, and a hat or bonnet was occasionally seen to\r\nfall, as a wounded man was borne off by his comrades. These, however,\r\nwere but trifling skirmishes, for it suited the views of neither party\r\nto advance in that direction. From the neighbouring hamlets the\r\npeasantry cautiously showed themselves, as if watching the issue of the\r\nexpected engagement; and at no great distance in the bay were two\r\nsquare-rigged vessels, bearing the English flag, whose tops and yards\r\nwere crowded with less timid spectators.\r\n\r\nWhen this awful pause had lasted for a short time, Fergus, with another\r\nchieftain, received orders to detach their clans towards the village of\r\nPreston, in order to threaten the right flank of Cope’s army and compel\r\nhim to a change of position. To enable him to execute these orders, the\r\nChief of Glennaquoich occupied the church-yard of Tranent, a commanding\r\nsituation, and a convenient place, as Evan Dhu remarked, “for any\r\ngentleman who might have the misfortune to be killed, and chanced to be\r\ncurious about Christian burial.” To check or dislodge this party, the\r\nEnglish general detached two guns, escorted by a strong party of\r\ncavalry. They approached so near that Waverley could plainly recognise\r\nthe standard of the troop he had formerly commanded, and hear the\r\ntrumpets and kettle-drums sound the signal of advance which he had so\r\noften obeyed. He could hear, too, the well-known word given in the\r\nEnglish dialect by the equally well-distinguished voice of the\r\ncommanding officer, for whom he had once felt so much respect. It was\r\nat that instant, that, looking around him, he saw the wild dress and\r\nappearance of his Highland associates, heard their whispers in an\r\nuncouth and unknown language, looked upon his own dress, so unlike that\r\nwhich he had worn from his infancy, and wished to awake from what\r\nseemed at the moment a dream, strange, horrible, and unnatural. “Good\r\nGod!” he muttered, “am I then a traitor to my country, a renegade to my\r\nstandard, and a foe, as that poor dying wretch expressed himself, to my\r\nnative England!”\r\n\r\nEre he could digest or smother the recollection, the tall military form\r\nof his late commander came full in view, for the purpose of\r\nreconnoitring. “I can hit him now,” said Callum, cautiously raising his\r\nfusee over the wall under which he lay couched, at scarce sixty yards’\r\ndistance.\r\n\r\nEdward felt as if he was about to see a parricide committed in his\r\npresence; for the venerable grey hair and striking countenance of the\r\nveteran recalled the almost paternal respect with which his officers\r\nuniversally regarded him. But ere he could say “Hold!” an aged\r\nHighlander who lay beside Callum Beg stopped his arm. “Spare your\r\nshot,” said the seer, “his hour is not yet come. But let him beware of\r\nto-morrow; I see his winding-sheet high upon his breast.”\r\n\r\nCallum, flint to other considerations, was penetrable to superstition.\r\nHe turned pale at the words of the _taishatr_, and recovered his piece.\r\nColonel Gardiner, unconscious of the danger he had escaped, turned his\r\nhorse round and rode slowly back to the front of his regiment.\r\n\r\nBy this time the regular army had assumed a new line, with one flank\r\ninclined towards the sea and the other resting upon the village of\r\nPreston; and, as similar difficulties occurred in attacking their new\r\nposition, Fergus and the rest of the detachment were recalled to their\r\nformer post. This alteration created the necessity of a corresponding\r\nchange in General Cope’s army, which was again brought into a line\r\nparallel with that of the Highlanders. In these manœuvres on both sides\r\nthe daylight was nearly consumed, and both armies prepared to rest upon\r\ntheir arms for the night in the lines which they respectively occupied.\r\n\r\n“There will be nothing done to-night,” said Fergus to his friend\r\nWaverley; “ere we wrap ourselves in our plaids, let us go see what the\r\nBaron is doing in the rear of the line.”\r\n\r\nWhen they approached his post, they found the good old careful officer,\r\nafter having sent out his night patrols and posted his sentinels,\r\nengaged in reading the Evening Service of the Episcopal Church to the\r\nremainder of his troop. His voice was loud and sonorous, and though his\r\nspectacles upon his nose, and the appearance of Saunders Saunderson, in\r\nmilitary array, performing the functions of clerk, had something\r\nludicrous, yet the circumstances of danger in which they stood, the\r\nmilitary costume of the audience, and the appearance of their horses\r\nsaddled and picqueted behind them, gave an impressive and solemn effect\r\nto the office of devotion.\r\n\r\n“I have confessed to-day, ere you were awake,” whispered Fergus to\r\nWaverley; “yet I am not so strict a Catholic as to refuse to join in\r\nthis good man’s prayers.”\r\n\r\nEdward assented, and they remained till the Baron had concluded the\r\nservice.\r\n\r\nAs he shut the book, “Now, lads,” said he, “have at them in the morning\r\nwith heavy hands and light consciences.” He then kindly greeted\r\nMac-Ivor and Waverley, who requested to know his opinion of their\r\nsituation. “Why, you know Tacitus saith, “In rebus bellicis maxime\r\ndominalur Fortuna,” which is equiponderate with our vernacular adage,\r\n“Luck can maist in the mellee.” But credit me, gentlemen, yon man is\r\nnot a deacon o’ his craft. He damps the spirits of the poor lads he\r\ncommands by keeping them on the defensive, whilk of itself implies\r\ninferiority or fear. Now will they lie on their arms yonder as anxious\r\nand as ill at ease as a toad under a harrow, while our men will be\r\nquite fresh and blithe for action in the morning. Well, good-night. One\r\nthing troubles me, but if to-morrow goes well off, I will consult you\r\nabout it, Glennaquoich.”\r\n\r\n“I could almost apply to Mr. Bradwardine the character which Henry\r\ngives of Fluellen,” said Waverley, as his friend and he walked towards\r\ntheir bivouac:—\r\n\r\n‘Though it appears a little out of fashion,\r\nThere is much care and valour in this ‘Scotchman.’”\r\n\r\n\r\n“He has seen much service,” answered Fergus, “and one is sometimes\r\nastonished to find how much nonsense and reason are mingled in his\r\ncomposition. I wonder what can be troubling his mind; probably\r\nsomething about Rose. Hark! the English are setting their watch.”\r\n\r\nThe roll of the drum and shrill accompaniment of the fifes swelled up\r\nthe hill—died away—resumed its thunder—and was at length hushed. The\r\ntrumpets and kettle-drums of the cavalry were next heard to perform the\r\nbeautiful and wild point of war appropriated as a signal for that piece\r\nof nocturnal duty, and then finally sunk upon the wind with a shrill\r\nand mournful cadence.\r\n\r\nThe friends, who had now reached their post, stood and looked round\r\nthem ere they lay down to rest. The western sky twinkled with stars,\r\nbut a frost-mist, rising from the ocean, covered the eastern horizon,\r\nand rolled in white wreaths along the plain where the adverse army lay\r\ncouched upon their arms. Their advanced posts were pushed as far as the\r\nside of the great ditch at the bottom of the descent, and had kindled\r\nlarge fires at different intervals, gleaming with obscure and hazy\r\nlustre through the heavy fog which encircled them with a doubtful halo.\r\n\r\nThe Highlanders, “thick as leaves in Vallombrosa,” lay stretched upon\r\nthe ridge of the hill, buried (excepting their sentinels) in the most\r\nprofound repose. “How many of these brave fellows will sleep more\r\nsoundly before to-morrow night, Fergus!” said Waverley, with an\r\ninvoluntary sigh.\r\n\r\n“You must not think of that,” answered Fergus, whose ideas were\r\nentirely military. “You must only think of your sword, and by whom it\r\nwas given. All other reflections are now TOO LATE.”\r\n\r\nWith the opiate contained in this undeniable remark Edward endeavoured\r\nto lull the tumult of his conflicting feelings. The Chieftain and he,\r\ncombining their plaids, made a comfortable and warm couch. Callum,\r\nsitting down at their head (for it was his duty to watch upon the\r\nimmediate person of the Chief), began a long mournful song in Gaelic,\r\nto a low and uniform tune, which, like the sound of the wind at a\r\ndistance, soon lulled them to sleep.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVIII.\r\nTHE CONFLICT\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen Fergus Mac-Ivor and his friend had slept for a few hours, they\r\nwere awakened and summoned to attend the Prince. The distant village\r\nclock was heard to toll three as they hastened to the place where he\r\nlay. He was already surrounded by his principal officers and the chiefs\r\nof clans. A bundle of pease-straw, which had been lately his couch, now\r\nserved for his seat. Just as Fergus reached the circle, the\r\nconsultation had broken up. “Courage, my brave friends!” said the\r\nChevalier, “and each one put himself instantly at the head of his\r\ncommand; a faithful friend[32] has offered to guide us by a\r\npracticable, though narrow and circuitous, route, which, sweeping to\r\nour right, traverses the broken ground and morass, and enables us to\r\ngain the firm and open plain upon which the enemy are lying. This\r\ndifficulty surmounted, Heaven and your good swords must do the rest.”\r\n\r\nThe proposal spread unanimous joy, and each leader hastened to get his\r\nmen into order with as little noise as possible. The army, moving by\r\nits right from off the ground on which they had rested, soon entered\r\nthe path through the morass, conducting their march with astonishing\r\nsilence and great rapidity. The mist had not risen to the higher\r\ngrounds, so that for some time they had the advantage of star-light.\r\nBut this was lost as the stars faded before approaching day, and the\r\nhead of the marching column, continuing its descent, plunged as it were\r\ninto the heavy ocean of fog, which rolled its white waves over the\r\nwhole plain, and over the sea by which it was bounded. Some\r\ndifficulties were now to be encountered, inseparable from darkness, a\r\nnarrow, broken, and marshy path, and the necessity of preserving union\r\nin the march. These, however, were less inconvenient to Highlanders,\r\nfrom their habits of life, than they would have been to any other\r\ntroops, and they continued a steady and swift movement.\r\n\r\nAs the clan of Ivor approached the firm ground, following the track of\r\nthose who preceded them, the challenge of a patrol was heard through\r\nthe mist, though they could not see the dragoon by whom it was\r\nmade—“Who goes there?”\r\n\r\n“Hush!” cried Fergus, “hush! let none answer, as he values his life;\r\npress forward”; and they continued their march with silence and\r\nrapidity.\r\n\r\nThe patrol fired his carabine upon the body, and the report was\r\ninstantly followed by the clang of his horse’s feet as he galloped off.\r\n“Hylax in limine latrat,” said the Baron of Bradwardine, who heard the\r\nshot; “that loon will give the alarm.”\r\n\r\nThe clan of Fergus had now gained the firm plain, which had lately\r\nborne a large crop of corn. But the harvest was gathered in, and the\r\nexpanse was unbroken by tree, bush, or interruption of any kind. The\r\nrest of the army were following fast, when they heard the drums of the\r\nenemy beat the general. Surprise, however, had made no part of their\r\nplan, so they were not disconcerted by this intimation that the foe was\r\nupon his guard and prepared to receive them. It only hastened their\r\ndispositions for the combat, which were very simple.\r\n\r\nThe Highland army, which now occupied the eastern end of the wide\r\nplain, or stubble field, so often referred to, was drawn up in two\r\nlines, extending from the morass towards the sea. The first was\r\ndestined to charge the enemy, the second to act as a reserve. The few\r\nhorse, whom the Prince headed in person, remained between the two\r\nlines. The adventurer had intimated a resolution to charge in person at\r\nthe head of his first line; but his purpose was deprecated by all\r\naround him, and he was with difficulty induced to abandon it.\r\n\r\nBoth lines were now moving forward, the first prepared for instant\r\ncombat. The clans of which it was composed formed each a sort of\r\nseparate phalanx, narrow in front, and in depth ten, twelve, or fifteen\r\nfiles, according to the strength of the following. The best-armed and\r\nbest-born, for the words were synonymous, were placed in front of each\r\nof these irregular subdivisions. The others in the rear shouldered\r\nforward the front, and by their pressure added both physical impulse\r\nand additional ardour and confidence to those who were first to\r\nencounter the danger.\r\n\r\n“Down with your plaid, Waverley,” cried Fergus, throwing off his own;\r\n“we’ll win silks for our tartans before the sun is above the sea.”\r\n\r\nThe clansmen on every side stript their plaids, prepared their arms,\r\nand there was an awful pause of about three minutes, during which the\r\nmen, pulling off their bonnets, raised their faces to heaven and\r\nuttered a short prayer; then pulled their bonnets over their brows and\r\nbegan to move forward, at first slowly. Waverley felt his heart at that\r\nmoment throb as it would have burst from his bosom. It was not fear, it\r\nwas not ardour: it was a compound of both, a new and deeply energetic\r\nimpulse that with its first emotion chilled and astounded, then fevered\r\nand maddened his mind. The sounds around him combined to exalt his\r\nenthusiasm; the pipes played, and the clans rushed forward, each in its\r\nown dark column. As they advanced they mended their pace, and the\r\nmuttering sounds of the men to each other began to swell into a wild\r\ncry.\r\n\r\nAt this moment the sun, which was now risen above the horizon,\r\ndispelled the mist. The vapours rose like a curtain, and showed the two\r\narmies in the act of closing. The line of the regulars was formed\r\ndirectly fronting the attack of the Highlanders; it glittered with the\r\nappointments of a complete army, and was flanked by cavalry and\r\nartillery. But the sight impressed no terror on the assailants.\r\n\r\n“Forward, sons of Ivor,” cried their Chief, “or the Camerons will draw\r\nthe first blood!” They rushed on with a tremendous yell.\r\n\r\nThe rest is well known. The horse, who were commanded to charge the\r\nadvancing Highlanders in the flank, received an irregular fire from\r\ntheir fusees as they ran on and, seized with a disgraceful panic,\r\nwavered, halted, disbanded, and galloped from the field. The artillery\r\nmen, deserted by the cavalry, fled after discharging their pieces, and\r\nthe Highlanders, who dropped their guns when fired and drew their\r\nbroadswords, rushed with headlong fury against the infantry.\r\n\r\nIt was at this moment of confusion and terror that Waverley remarked an\r\nEnglish officer, apparently of high rank, standing, alone and\r\nunsupported, by a fieldpiece, which, after the flight of the men by\r\nwhom it was wrought, he had himself levelled and discharged against the\r\nclan of Mac-Ivor, the nearest group of Highlanders within his aim.\r\nStruck with his tall, martial figure, and eager to save him from\r\ninevitable destruction, Waverley outstripped for an instant even the\r\nspeediest of the warriors, and, reaching the spot first, called to him\r\nto surrender. The officer replied by a thrust with his sword, which\r\nWaverley received in his target, and in turning it aside the\r\nEnglishman’s weapon broke. At the same time the battle-axe of Dugald\r\nMahony was in the act of descending upon the officer’s head. Waverley\r\nintercepted and prevented the blow, and the officer, perceiving further\r\nresistance unavailing, and struck with Edward’s generous anxiety for\r\nhis safety, resigned the fragment of his sword, and was committed by\r\nWaverley to Dugald, with strict charge to use him well, and not to\r\npillage his person, promising him, at the same time, full\r\nindemnification for the spoil.\r\n\r\nOn Edward’s right the battle for a few minutes raged fierce and thick.\r\nThe English infantry, trained in the wars in Flanders, stood their\r\nground with great courage. But their extended files were pierced and\r\nbroken in many places by the close masses of the clans; and in the\r\npersonal struggle which ensued the nature of the Highlanders’ weapons,\r\nand their extraordinary fierceness and activity, gave them a decided\r\nsuperiority over those who had been accustomed to trust much to their\r\narray and discipline, and felt that the one was broken and the other\r\nuseless. Waverley, as he cast his eyes towards this scene of smoke and\r\nslaughter, observed Colonel Gardiner, deserted by his own soldiers in\r\nspite of all his attempts to rally them, yet spurring his horse through\r\nthe field to take the command of a small body of infantry, who, with\r\ntheir backs arranged against the wall of his own park (for his house\r\nwas close by the field of battle), continued a desperate and unavailing\r\nresistance. Waverley could perceive that he had already received many\r\nwounds, his clothes and saddle being marked with blood. To save this\r\ngood and brave man became the instant object of his most anxious\r\nexertions. But he could only witness his fall. Ere Edward could make\r\nhis way among the Highlanders, who, furious and eager for spoil, now\r\nthronged upon each other, he saw his former commander brought from his\r\nhorse by the blow of a scythe, and beheld him receive, while on the\r\nground, more wounds than would have let out twenty lives. When Waverley\r\ncame up, however, perception had not entirely fled. The dying warrior\r\nseemed to recognize Edward, for he fixed his eye upon him with an\r\nupbraiding, yet sorrowful, look, and appeared to struggle, for\r\nutterance. But he felt that death was dealing closely with him, and\r\nresigning his purpose, and folding his hands as if in devotion, he gave\r\nup his soul to his Creator. The look with which he regarded Waverley in\r\nhis dying moments did not strike him so deeply at that crisis of hurry\r\nand confusion as when it recurred to his imagination at the distance of\r\nsome time.[33]\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nLoud shouts of triumph now echoed over the whole field. The battle was\r\nfought and won, and the whole baggage, artillery, and military stores\r\nof the regular army remained in possession of the victors. Never was a\r\nvictory more complete. Scarce any escaped from the battle, excepting\r\nthe cavalry, who had left it at the very onset, and even these were\r\nbroken into different parties and scattered all over the country. So\r\nfar as our tale is concerned, we have only to relate the fate of\r\nBalmawhapple, who, mounted on a horse as headstrong and stiff-necked as\r\nhis rider, pursued the flight of the dragoons above four miles from the\r\nfield of battle, when some dozen of the fugitives took heart of grace,\r\nturned round, and cleaving his skull with their broadswords, satisfied\r\nthe world that the unfortunate gentleman had actually brains, the end\r\nof his life thus giving proof of a fact greatly doubted during its\r\nprogress. His death was lamented by few. Most of those who knew him\r\nagreed in the pithy observation of Ensign Maccombich, that there “was\r\nmair _tint_ (lost) at Sheriff-Muir.” His friend, Lieutenant Jinker,\r\nbent his eloquence only to exculpate his favourite mare from any share\r\nin contributing to the catastrophe. “He had tauld the laird a thousand\r\ntimes,” he said, “that it was a burning shame to put a martingale upon\r\nthe puir thing, when he would needs ride her wi’ a curb of half a yard\r\nlang; and that he could na but bring himsell (not to say her) to some\r\nmischief, by flinging her down, or otherwise; whereas, if he had had a\r\nwee bit rinnin ring on the snaffle, she wad ha’ rein’d as cannily as a\r\ncadger’s pownie.”\r\n\r\nSuch was the elegy of the Laird of Balmawhapple.[34]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIX.\r\nAN UNEXPECTED EMBARRASSMENT\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen the battle was over, and all things coming into order, the Baron\r\nof Bradwardine, returning from the duty of the day, and having disposed\r\nthose under his command in their proper stations, sought the Chieftain\r\nof Glennaquoich and his friend Edward Waverley. He found the former\r\nbusied in determining disputes among his clansmen about points of\r\nprecedence and deeds of valour, besides sundry high and doubtful\r\nquestions concerning plunder. The most important of the last respected\r\nthe property of a gold watch, which had once belonged to some\r\nunfortunate English officer. The party against whom judgment was\r\nawarded consoled himself by observing, “She (that is, the watch, which\r\nhe took for a living animal) died the very night Vich Ian Vohr gave her\r\nto Murdoch”; the machine, having, in fact, stopped for want of winding\r\nup.\r\n\r\nIt was just when this important question was decided that the Baron of\r\nBradwardine, with a careful and yet important expression of\r\ncountenance, joined the two young men. He descended from his reeking\r\ncharger, the care of which he recommended to one of his grooms. “I\r\nseldom ban, sir,” said he to the man; “but if you play any of your\r\nhound’s-foot tricks, and leave puir Berwick before he’s sorted, to rin\r\nafter spuilzie, deil be wi’ me if I do not give your craig a thraw.” He\r\nthen stroked with great complacency the animal which had borne him\r\nthrough the fatigues of the day, and having taken a tender leave of\r\nhim—“Weel, my good young friends, a glorious and decisive victory,”\r\nsaid he; “but these loons of troopers fled ower soon. I should have\r\nliked to have shown you the true points of the _prælium equestre_, or\r\nequestrian combat, whilk their cowardice has postponed, and which I\r\nhold to be the pride and terror of warfare. Weel—I have fought once\r\nmore in this old quarrel, though I admit I could not be so far _ben_ as\r\nyou lads, being that it was my point of duty to keep together our\r\nhandful of horse. And no cavalier ought in any wise to begrudge honour\r\nthat befalls his companions, even though they are ordered upon thrice\r\nhis danger, whilk, another time, by the blessing of God, may be his own\r\ncase. But, Glennaquoich, and you, Mr. Waverley, I pray ye to give me\r\nyour best advice on a matter of mickle weight, and which deeply affects\r\nthe honour of the house of Bradwardine. I crave your pardon, Ensign\r\nMaccombich, and yours, Inveraughlin, and yours, Edderalshendrach, and\r\nyours, sir.”\r\n\r\nThe last person he addressed was Ballenkeiroch, who, remembering the\r\ndeath of his son, loured on him with a look of savage defiance. The\r\nBaron, quick as lightning at taking umbrage, had already bent his brow\r\nwhen Glennaquoich dragged his major from the spot, and remonstrated\r\nwith him, in the authoritative tone of a chieftain, on the madness of\r\nreviving a quarrel in such a moment.\r\n\r\n“The ground is cumbered with carcasses,” said the old mountaineer,\r\nturning sullenly away; “_one more_ would hardly have been kenn’d upon\r\nit; and if it wasna for yoursell, Vich Ian Vohr, that one should be\r\nBradwardine’s or mine.”\r\n\r\nThe Chief soothed while he hurried him away; and then returned to the\r\nBaron. “It is Ballenkeiroch,” he said, in an under and confidential\r\nvoice, “father of the young man who fell eight years since in the\r\nunlucky affair at the mains.”\r\n\r\n“Ah!” said the Baron, instantly relaxing the doubtful sternness of his\r\nfeatures, “I can take mickle frae a man to whom I have unhappily\r\nrendered sic a displeasure as that. Ye were right to apprise me,\r\nGlennaquoich; he may look as black as midnight at Martinmas ere Cosmo\r\nComyne Bradwardine shall say he does him wrang. Ah! I have nae male\r\nlineage, and I should bear with one I have made childless, though you\r\nare aware the blood-wit was made up to your ain satisfaction by\r\nassythment, and that I have since expedited letters of slains. Weel, as\r\nI have said, I have no male issue, and yet it is needful that I\r\nmaintain the honour of my house; and it is on that score I prayed ye\r\nfor your peculiar and private attention.”\r\n\r\nThe two young men awaited to hear him, in anxious curiosity.\r\n\r\n“I doubt na, lads,” he proceeded, “but your education has been sae seen\r\nto that ye understand the true nature of the feudal tenures?”\r\n\r\nFergus, afraid of an endless dissertation, answered, “Intimately,\r\nBaron,” and touched Waverley as a signal to express no ignorance.\r\n\r\n“And ye are aware, I doubt not, that the holding of the barony of\r\nBradwardine is of a nature alike honourable and peculiar, being blanch\r\n(which Craig opines ought to be Latinated _blancum_, or rather\r\n_francum_, a free holding) _pro servitio detrahendi, seu exuendi,\r\ncaligas regis post battalliam_.” Here Fergus turned his falcon eye upon\r\nEdward, with an almost imperceptible rise of his eyebrow, to which his\r\nshoulders corresponded in the same degree of elevation. “Now, twa\r\npoints of dubitation occur to me upon this topic. First, whether this\r\nservice, or feudal homage, be at any event due to the person of the\r\nPrince, the words being, _per expressum, caligas_ REGIS, the boots of\r\nthe king himself; and I pray your opinion anent that particular before\r\nwe proceed farther.”\r\n\r\n“Why, he is Prince Regent,” answered Mac-Ivor, with laudable composure\r\nof countenance; “and in the court of France all the honours are\r\nrendered to the person of the Regent which are due to that of the King.\r\nBesides, were I to pull off either of their boots, I would render that\r\nservice to the young Chevalier ten times more willingly than to his\r\nfather.”\r\n\r\n“Ay, but I talk not of personal predilections. However, your authority\r\nis of great weight as to the usages of the court of France; and\r\ndoubtless the Prince, as _alter ego_, may have a right to claim the\r\n_homagium_ of the great tenants of the crown, since all faithful\r\nsubjects are commanded, in the commission of regency, to respect him as\r\nthe King’s own person. Far, therefore, be it from me to diminish the\r\nlustre of his authority by withholding this act of homage, so\r\npeculiarly calculated to give it splendour; for I question if the\r\nEmperor of Germany hath his boots taken off by a free baron of the\r\nempire. But here lieth the second difficulty—the Prince wears no boots,\r\nbut simply brogues and trews.”\r\n\r\nThis last dilemma had almost disturbed Fergus’s gravity.\r\n\r\n“Why,” said he, “you know, Baron, the proverb tells us, “It’s ill\r\ntaking the breeks off a Highlandman,” and the boots are here in the\r\nsame predicament.”\r\n\r\n“The word _caligæ_, however,” continued the Baron, “though I admit\r\nthat, by family tradition, and even in our ancient evidents, it is\r\nexplained _lie_ BOOTS, means, in its primitive sense, rather sandals;\r\nand Caius Cæsar, the nephew and successor of Caius Tiberius, received\r\nthe agnomen of Caligula, ‘a caligulis, sive caligis levioribus, quibus\r\nadolescentior usus fuerat in exercitu Germanici patris sui.’ And the\r\n_caligæ_ were also proper to the monastic bodies; for we read in an\r\nancient glossarium upon the rule of Saint Benedict, in the Abbey of\r\nSaint Amand, that _caligæ_ were tied with latchets.”\r\n\r\n“That will apply to the brogues,” said Fergus.\r\n\r\n“It will so, my dear Glennaquoich, and the words are express: ‘Caligæ\r\ndictæ sunt quia ligantur; nam socci non ligantur, sed tantum\r\nintromittuntur;’ that is, _caligæ_ are denominated from the ligatures\r\nwherewith they are bound; whereas socci, which may be analogous to our\r\nmules, whilk the English denominate slippers, are only slipped upon the\r\nfeet. The words of the charter are also alternative, _exuere seu\r\ndetrahere_; that is, to _undo_, as in the case of sandals or brogues,\r\nand to _pull off_, as we say vernacularly concerning boots. Yet I would\r\nwe had more light; but I fear there is little chance of finding\r\nhereabout any erudite author _de re vestiaria_.”\r\n\r\n“I should doubt it very much,” said the Chieftain, looking around on\r\nthe straggling Highlanders, who were returning loaded with spoils of\r\nthe slain, “though the _res vestiaria_ itself seems to be in some\r\nrequest at present.”\r\n\r\nThis remark coming within the Baron’s idea of jocularity, he honoured\r\nit with a smile, but immediately resumed what to him appeared very\r\nserious business.\r\n\r\n“Bailie Macwheeble indeed holds an opinion that this honorary service\r\nis due, from its very nature, _si petatur tantum;_ only if his Royal\r\nHighness shall require of the great tenant of the crown to perform that\r\npersonal duty; and indeed he pointed out the case in Dirleton’s Doubts\r\nand Queries, Grippit _versus_ Spicer, anent the eviction of an estate\r\n_ob non solutum canonem_, that is, for non-payment of a feu-duty of\r\nthree pepper-corns a year, whilk were taxt to be worth seven-eighths of\r\na penny Scots, in whilk the defender was assoilzied. But I deem it\r\nsafest, wi’ your good favour, to place myself in the way of rendering\r\nthe Prince this service, and to proffer performance thereof; and I\r\nshall cause the Bailie to attend with a schedule of a protest, whilk he\r\nhas here prepared (taking out a paper), intimating, that if it shall be\r\nhis Royal Highness’s pleasure to accept of other assistance at pulling\r\noff his _caligæ_ (whether the same shall be rendered boots or brogues)\r\nsave that of the said Baron of Bradwardine, who is in presence ready\r\nand willing to perform the same, it shall in no wise impinge upon or\r\nprejudice the right of the said Cosmo Comyne Bradwardine to perform the\r\nsaid service in future; nor shall it give any esquire, valet of the\r\nchamber, squire, or page, whose assistance it may please his Royal\r\nHighness to employ, any right, title, or ground for evicting from the\r\nsaid Cosmo Comyne Bradwardine the estate and barony of Bradwardine, and\r\nothers held as aforesaid, by the due and faithful performance thereof.”\r\n\r\nFergus highly applauded this arrangement; and the Baron took a friendly\r\nleave of them, with a smile of contented importance upon his visage.\r\n\r\n“Long live our dear friend the Baron,” exclaimed the Chief, as soon as\r\nhe was out of hearing, “for the most absurd original that exists north\r\nof the Tweed! I wish to heaven I had recommended him to attend the\r\ncircle this evening with a boot-ketch under his arm. I think he might\r\nhave adopted the suggestion if it had been made with suitable gravity.”\r\n\r\n“And how can you take pleasure in making a man of his worth so\r\nridiculous?”\r\n\r\n“Begging pardon, my dear Waverley, you are as ridiculous as he. Why, do\r\nyou not see that the man’s whole mind is wrapped up in this ceremony?\r\nHe has heard and thought of it since infancy as the most august\r\nprivilege and ceremony in the world; and I doubt not but the expected\r\npleasure of performing it was a principal motive with him for taking up\r\narms. Depend upon it, had I endeavoured to divert him from exposing\r\nhimself he would have treated me as an ignorant, conceited coxcomb, or\r\nperhaps might have taken a fancy to cut my throat; a pleasure which he\r\nonce proposed to himself upon some point of etiquette not half so\r\nimportant, in his eyes, as this matter of boots or brogues, or whatever\r\nthe _caligæ_ shall finally be pronounced by the learned. But I must go\r\nto headquarters, to prepare the Prince for this extraordinary scene. My\r\ninformation will be well taken, for it will give him a hearty laugh at\r\npresent, and put him on his guard against laughing when it might be\r\nvery _mal-à-propos_. So, _au revoir_, my dear Waverley.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XX.\r\nTHE ENGLISH PRISONER\r\n\r\n\r\nThe first occupation of Waverley, after he departed from the Chieftain,\r\nwas to go in quest of the officer whose life he had saved. He was\r\nguarded, along with his companions in misfortune, who were very\r\nnumerous, in a gentleman’s house near the field of battle.\r\n\r\nOn entering the room where they stood crowded together, Waverley easily\r\nrecognised the object of his visit, not only by the peculiar dignity of\r\nhis appearance, but by the appendage of Dugald Mahony, with his\r\nbattleaxe, who had stuck to him from the moment of his captivity as if\r\nhe had been skewered to his side. This close attendance was perhaps for\r\nthe purpose of securing his promised reward from Edward, but it also\r\noperated to save the English gentleman from being plundered in the\r\nscene of general confusion; for Dugald sagaciously argued that the\r\namount of the salvage which he might be allowed would be regulated by\r\nthe state of the prisoner when he should deliver him over to Waverley.\r\nHe hastened to assure Waverley, therefore, with more words than he\r\nusually employed, that he had “keepit ta _sidier roy_ haill, and that\r\nhe wasna a plack the waur since the fery moment when his honour forbad\r\nher to gie him a bit clamhewit wi’ her Lochaber-axe.”\r\n\r\nWaverley assured Dugald of a liberal recompense, and, approaching the\r\nEnglish officer, expressed his anxiety to do anything which might\r\ncontribute to his convenience under his present unpleasant\r\ncircumstances.\r\n\r\n“I am not so inexperienced a soldier, sir,” answered the Englishman,\r\n“as to complain of the fortune of war. I am only grieved to see those\r\nscenes acted in our own island which I have often witnessed elsewhere\r\nwith comparative indifference.”\r\n\r\n“Another such day as this,” said Waverley, “and I trust the cause of\r\nyour regrets will be removed, and all will again return to peace and\r\norder.”\r\n\r\nThe officer smiled and shook his head. “I must not forget my situation\r\nso far as to attempt a formal confutation of that opinion; but,\r\nnotwithstanding your success and the valour which achieved it, you have\r\nundertaken a task to which your strength appears wholly inadequate.”\r\n\r\nAt this moment Fergus pushed into the press.\r\n\r\n“Come, Edward, come along; the Prince has gone to Pinkie House for the\r\nnight; and we must follow, or lose the whole ceremony of the _caligæ_.\r\nYour friend, the Baron, has been guilty of a great piece of cruelty; he\r\nhas insisted upon dragging Bailie Macwheeble out to the field of\r\nbattle. Now, you must know, the Bailie’s greatest horror is an armed\r\nHighlander or a loaded gun; and there he stands, listening to the\r\nBaron’s instructions concerning the protest, ducking his head like a\r\nsea-gull at the report of every gun and pistol that our idle boys are\r\nfiring upon the fields, and undergoing, by way of penance, at every\r\nsymptom of flinching a severe rebuke from his patron, who would not\r\nadmit the discharge of a whole battery of cannon, within point-blank\r\ndistance, as an apology for neglecting a discourse in which the honour\r\nof his family is interested.”\r\n\r\n“But how has Mr. Bradwardine got him to venture so far?” said Edward.\r\n\r\n“Why, he had come as far as Musselburgh, I fancy, in hopes of making\r\nsome of our wills; and the peremptory commands of the Baron dragged him\r\nforward to Preston after the battle was over. He complains of one or\r\ntwo of our ragamuffins having put him in peril of his life by\r\npresenting their pieces at him; but as they limited his ransom to an\r\nEnglish penny, I don’t think we need trouble the provost-marshal upon\r\nthat subject. So come along, Waverley.”\r\n\r\n“Waverley!” said the English officer, with great emotion; “the nephew\r\nof Sir Everard Waverley, of ——shire?”\r\n\r\n“The same, sir,” replied our hero, somewhat surprised at the tone in\r\nwhich he was addressed.\r\n\r\n“I am at once happy and grieved,” said the prisoner, “to have met with\r\nyou.”\r\n\r\n“I am ignorant, sir,” answered Waverley, “how I have deserved so much\r\ninterest.”\r\n\r\n“Did your uncle never mention a friend called Talbot?”\r\n\r\n“I have heard him talk with great regard of such a person,” replied\r\nEdward; “a colonel, I believe, in the army, and the husband of Lady\r\nEmily Blandeville; but I thought Colonel Talbot had been abroad.”\r\n\r\n“I am just returned,” answered the officer; “and being in Scotland,\r\nthought it my duty to act where my services promised to be useful. Yes,\r\nMr. Waverley, I am that Colonel Talbot, the husband of the lady you\r\nhave named; and I am proud to acknowledge that I owe alike my\r\nprofessional rank and my domestic happiness to your generous and\r\nnoble-minded relative. Good God! that I should find his nephew in such\r\na dress, and engaged in such a cause!”\r\n\r\n“Sir,” said Fergus, haughtily, “the dress and cause are those of men of\r\nbirth and honour.”\r\n\r\n“My situation forbids me to dispute your assertion,” said Colonel\r\nTalbot; “otherwise it were no difficult matter to show that neither\r\ncourage nor pride of lineage can gild a bad cause. But, with Mr.\r\nWaverley’s permission and yours, sir, if yours also must be asked, I\r\nwould willingly speak a few words with him on affairs connected with\r\nhis own family.”\r\n\r\n“Mr. Waverley, sir, regulates his own motions. You will follow me, I\r\nsuppose, to Pinkie,” said Fergus, turning to Edward, “when you have\r\nfinished your discourse with this new acquaintance?” So saying, the\r\nChief of Glennaquoich adjusted his plaid with rather more than his\r\nusual air of haughty assumption and left the apartment.\r\n\r\nThe interest of Waverley readily procured for Colonel Talbot the\r\nfreedom of adjourning to a large garden belonging to his place of\r\nconfinement. They walked a few paces in silence, Colonel Talbot\r\napparently studying how to open what he had to say; at length he\r\naddressed Edward.\r\n\r\n“Mr. Waverley, you have this day saved my life; and yet I would to God\r\nthat I had lost it, ere I had found you wearing the uniform and cockade\r\nof these men.”\r\n\r\n“I forgive your reproach, Colonel Talbot; it is well meant, and your\r\neducation and prejudices render it natural. But there is nothing\r\nextraordinary in finding a man whose honour has been publicly and\r\nunjustly assailed in the situation which promised most fair to afford\r\nhim satisfaction on his calumniators.”\r\n\r\n“I should rather say, in the situation most likely to confirm the\r\nreports which they have circulated,” said Colonel Talbot, “by following\r\nthe very line of conduct ascribed to you. Are you aware, Mr. Waverley,\r\nof the infinite distress, and even danger, which your present conduct\r\nhas occasioned to your nearest relatives?”\r\n\r\n“Danger!”\r\n\r\n“Yes, sir, danger. When I left England your uncle and father had been\r\nobliged to find bail to answer a charge of treason, to which they were\r\nonly admitted by the exertion of the most powerful interest. I came\r\ndown to Scotland with the sole purpose of rescuing you from the gulf\r\ninto which you have precipitated yourself; nor can I estimate the\r\nconsequences to your family of your having openly joined the rebellion,\r\nsince the very suspicion of your intention was so perilous to them.\r\nMost deeply do I regret that I did not meet you before this last and\r\nfatal error.”\r\n\r\n“I am really ignorant,” said Waverley, in a tone of reserve, “why\r\nColonel Talbot should have taken so much trouble on my account.”\r\n\r\n“Mr. Waverley,” answered Talbot, “I am dull at apprehending irony; and\r\ntherefore I shall answer your words according to their plain meaning. I\r\nam indebted to your uncle for benefits greater than those which a son\r\nowes to a father. I acknowledge to him the duty of a son; and as I know\r\nthere is no manner in which I can requite his kindness so well as by\r\nserving you, I will serve you, if possible, whether you will permit me\r\nor no. The personal obligation which you have this day laid me under\r\n(although, in common estimation, as great as one human being can bestow\r\non another) adds nothing to my zeal on your behalf; nor can that zeal\r\nbe abated by any coolness with which you may please to receive it.”\r\n\r\n“Your intentions may be kind, sir,” said Waverley, drily; “but your\r\nlanguage is harsh, or at least peremptory.”\r\n\r\n“On my return to England,” continued Colonel Talbot, “after long\r\nabsence, I found your uncle, Sir Everard Waverley, in the custody of a\r\nking’s messenger, in consequence of the suspicion brought upon him by\r\nyour conduct. He is my oldest friend—how often shall I repeat it?—my\r\nbest benefactor! he sacrificed his own views of happiness to mine; he\r\nnever uttered a word, he never harboured a thought, that benevolence\r\nitself might not have thought or spoken. I found this man in\r\nconfinement, rendered harsher to him by his habits of life, his natural\r\ndignity of feeling, and—forgive me, Mr. Waverley—by the cause through\r\nwhich this calamity had come upon him. I cannot disguise from you my\r\nfeelings upon this occasion; they were most painfully unfavorable to\r\nyou. Having by my family interest, which you probably know is not\r\ninconsiderable, succeeded in obtaining Sir Everard’s release, I set out\r\nfor Scotland. I saw Colonel Gardiner, a man whose fate alone is\r\nsufficient to render this insurrection for ever execrable. In the\r\ncourse of conversation with him I found that, from late circumstances,\r\nfrom a re-examination of the persons engaged in the mutiny, and from\r\nhis original good opinion of your character, he was much softened\r\ntowards you; and I doubted not that, if I could be so fortunate as to\r\ndiscover you, all might yet be well. But this unnatural rebellion has\r\nruined all. I have, for the first time in a long and active military\r\nlife, seen Britons disgrace themselves by a panic flight, and that\r\nbefore a foe without either arms or discipline. And now I find the heir\r\nof my dearest friend—the son, I may say, of his affections—sharing a\r\ntriumph for which he ought the first to have blushed. Why should I\r\nlament Gardiner? his lot was happy compared to mine!”\r\n\r\nThere was so much dignity in Colonel Talbot’s manner, such a mixture of\r\nmilitary pride and manly sorrow, and the news of Sir Everard’s\r\nimprisonment was told in so deep a tone of feeling, that Edward stood\r\nmortified, abashed, and distressed in presence of the prisoner who owed\r\nto him his life not many hours before. He was not sorry when Fergus\r\ninterrupted their conference a second time.\r\n\r\n“His Royal Highness commands Mr. Waverley’s attendance.” Colonel Talbot\r\nthrew upon Edward a reproachful glance, which did not escape the quick\r\neye of the Highland Chief. “His _immediate_ attendance,” he repeated,\r\nwith considerable emphasis. Waverley turned again towards the Colonel.\r\n\r\n“We shall meet again,” he said; “in the meanwhile, every possible\r\naccommodation—”\r\n\r\n“I desire none,” said the Colonel; “let me fare like the meanest of\r\nthose brave men who, on this day of calamity, have preferred wounds and\r\ncaptivity to flight; I would almost exchange places with one of those\r\nwho have fallen to know that my words have made a suitable impression\r\non your mind.”\r\n\r\n“Let Colonel Talbot be carefully secured,” said Fergus to the Highland\r\nofficer who commanded the guard over the prisoners; “it is the Prince’s\r\nparticular command; he is a prisoner of the utmost importance.”\r\n\r\n“But let him want no accommodation suitable to his rank,” said\r\nWaverley. “Consistent always with secure custody,” reiterated Fergus.\r\nThe officer signified his acquiescence in both commands, and Edward\r\nfollowed Fergus to the garden-gate, where Callum Beg, with three\r\nsaddle-horses, awaited them. Turning his head, he saw Colonel Talbot\r\nreconducted to his place of confinement by a file of Highlanders; he\r\nlingered on the threshold of the door and made a signal with his hand\r\ntowards Waverley, as if enforcing the language he had held towards him.\r\n\r\n“Horses,” said Fergus, as he mounted, “are now as plenty as\r\nblackberries; every man may have them for the catching. Come, let\r\nCallum adjust your stirrups and let us to Pinkie House[*] as fast as\r\nthese _ci-devant_ dragoon-horses choose to carry us.”\r\n\r\n[* Charles Edward took up his quarters after the battle at Pinkie\r\nHouse, adjoining to Musselburgh.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXI.\r\nRATHER UNIMPORTANT\r\n\r\n\r\n“I was turned back,” said Fergus to Edward, as they galloped from\r\nPreston to Pinkie House, “by a message from the Prince. But I suppose\r\nyou know the value of this most noble Colonel Talbot as a prisoner. He\r\nis held one of the best officers among the red-coats, a special friend\r\nand favourite of the Elector himself, and of that dreadful hero, the\r\nDuke of Cumberland, who has been summoned from his triumphs at Fontenoy\r\nto come over and devour us poor Highlanders alive. Has he been telling\r\nyou how the bells of St. James’s ring? Not “turn again, Whittington,”\r\nlike those of Bow, in the days of yore?”\r\n\r\n“Fergus!” said Waverley, with a reproachful look.\r\n\r\n“Nay, I cannot tell what to make of you,” answered the Chief of\r\nMac-Ivor, “you are blown about with every wind of doctrine. Here have\r\nwe gained a victory unparalleled in history, and your behaviour is\r\npraised by every living mortal to the skies, and the Prince is eager to\r\nthank you in person, and all our beauties of the White Rose are pulling\r\ncaps for you;—and you, the _preux chevalier_ of the day, are stooping\r\non your horse’s neck like a butter-woman riding to market, and looking\r\nas black as a funeral!”\r\n\r\n“I am sorry for poor Colonel Gardiner’s death; he was once very kind to\r\nme.”\r\n\r\n“Why, then, be sorry for five minutes, and then be glad again; his\r\nchance to-day may be ours to-morrow; and what does it signify? The next\r\nbest thing to victory is honourable death; but it is a _pis-aller_, and\r\none would rather a foe had it than one’s self.”\r\n\r\n“But Colonel Talbot has informed me that my father and uncle are both\r\nimprisoned by government on my account.”\r\n\r\n“We’ll put in bail, my boy; old Andrew Ferrara[35] shall lodge his\r\nsecurity; and I should like to see him put to justify it in Westminster\r\nHall!”\r\n\r\n“Nay, they are already at liberty, upon bail of a more civic\r\ndisposition.”\r\n\r\n“Then why is thy noble spirit cast down, Edward? Dost think that the\r\nElector’s ministers are such doves as to set their enemies at liberty\r\nat this critical moment if they could or durst confine and punish them?\r\nAssure thyself that either they have no charge against your relations\r\non which they can continue their imprisonment, or else they are afraid\r\nof our friends, the jolly Cavaliers of old England. At any rate, you\r\nneed not be apprehensive upon their account; and we will find some\r\nmeans of conveying to them assurances of your safety.”\r\n\r\nEdward was silenced but not satisfied with these reasons. He had now\r\nbeen more than once shocked at the small degree of sympathy which\r\nFergus exhibited for the feelings even of those whom he loved, if they\r\ndid not correspond with his own mood at the time, and more especially\r\nif they thwarted him while earnest in a favourite pursuit. Fergus\r\nsometimes indeed observed that he had offended Waverley, but, always\r\nintent upon some favourite plan or project of his own, he was never\r\nsufficiently aware of the extent or duration of his displeasure, so\r\nthat the reiteration of these petty offences somewhat cooled the\r\nvolunteer’s extreme attachment to his officer.\r\n\r\nThe Chevalier received Waverley with his usual favour, and paid him\r\nmany compliments on his distinguished bravery. He then took him apart,\r\nmade many inquiries concerning Colonel Talbot, and when he had received\r\nall the information which Edward was able to give concerning him and\r\nhis connections, he proceeded—“I cannot but think, Mr. Waverley, that\r\nsince this gentleman is so particularly connected with our worthy and\r\nexcellent friend, Sir Everard Waverley, and since his lady is of the\r\nhouse of Blandeville, whose devotion to the true and loyal principles\r\nof the Church of England is so generally known, the Colonel’s own\r\nprivate sentiments cannot be unfavorable to us, whatever mask he may\r\nhave assumed to accommodate himself to the times.”\r\n\r\n“If I am to judge from the language he this day held to me, I am under\r\nthe necessity of differing widely from your Royal Highness.”\r\n\r\n“Well, it is worth making a trial at least. I therefore entrust you\r\nwith the charge of Colonel Talbot, with power to act concerning him as\r\nyou think most advisable; and I hope you will find means of\r\nascertaining what are his real dispositions towards our Royal Father’s\r\nrestoration.”\r\n\r\n“I am convinced,” said Waverley, bowing, “that if Colonel Talbot\r\nchooses to grant his parole, it may be securely depended upon; but if\r\nhe refuses it, I trust your Royal Highness will devolve on some other\r\nperson than the nephew of his friend the task of laying him under the\r\nnecessary restraint.”\r\n\r\n“I will trust him with no person but you,” said the Prince, smiling,\r\nbut peremptorily repeating his mandate; “it is of importance to my\r\nservice that there should appear to be a good intelligence between you,\r\neven if you are unable to gain his confidence in earnest. You will\r\ntherefore receive him into your quarters, and in case he declines\r\ngiving his parole, you must apply for a proper guard. I beg you will go\r\nabout this directly. We return to Edinburgh tomorrow.”\r\n\r\nBeing thus remanded to the vicinity of Preston, Waverley lost the Baron\r\nof Bradwardine’s solemn act of homage. So little, however, was he at\r\nthis time in love with vanity, that he had quite forgotten the ceremony\r\nin which Fergus had laboured to engage his curiosity. But next day a\r\nformal “Gazette” was circulated, containing a detailed account of the\r\nbattle of Gladsmuir, as the Highlanders chose to denominate their\r\nvictory. It concluded with an account of the court afterwards held by\r\nthe Chevalier at Pinkie House, which contained this among other\r\nhigh-flown descriptive paragraphs:—\r\n\r\n“Since that fatal treaty which annihilates Scotland as an independent\r\nnation, it has not been our happiness to see her princes receive, and\r\nher nobles discharge, those acts of feudal homage which, founded upon\r\nthe splendid actions of Scottish valour, recall the memory of her early\r\nhistory, with the manly and chivalrous simplicity of the ties which\r\nunited to the Crown the homage of the warriors by whom it was\r\nrepeatedly upheld and defended. But on the evening of the 20th our\r\nmemories were refreshed with one of those ceremonies which belong to\r\nthe ancient days of Scotland’s glory. After the circle was formed,\r\nCosmo Comyne Bradwardine of that ilk, colonel in the service, etc.,\r\netc., etc., came before the Prince, attended by Mr. D. Macwheeble, the\r\nBailie of his ancient barony of Bradwardine (who, we understand, has\r\nbeen lately named a commissary), and, under form of instrument, claimed\r\npermission to perform to the person of his Royal Highness, as\r\nrepresenting his father, the service used and wont, for which, under a\r\ncharter of Robert Bruce (of which the original was produced and\r\ninspected by the Masters of his Royal Highness’s Chancery for the time\r\nbeing), the claimant held the barony of Bradwardine and lands of\r\nTully-Veolan. His claim being admitted and registered, his Royal\r\nHighness having placed his foot upon a cushion, the Baron of\r\nBradwardine, kneeling upon his right knee, proceeded to undo the\r\nlatchet of the brogue, or low-heeled Highland shoe, which our gallant\r\nyoung hero wears in compliment to his brave followers. When this was\r\nperformed, his Royal Highness declared the ceremony completed; and,\r\nembracing the gallant veteran, protested that nothing but compliance\r\nwith an ordinance of Robert Bruce could have induced him to receive\r\neven the symbolical performance of a menial office from hands which had\r\nfought so bravely to put the crown upon the head of his father. The\r\nBaron of Bradwardine then took instruments in the hands of Mr.\r\nCommissary Macwheeble, bearing that all points and circumstances of the\r\nact of homage had been _rite et solenniter acta et peracta;_ and a\r\ncorresponding entry was made in the protocol of the Lord High\r\nChamberlain and in the record of Chancery. We understand that it is in\r\ncontemplation of his Royal Highness, when his Majesty’s pleasure can be\r\nknown, to raise Colonel Bradwardine to the peerage, by the title of\r\nViscount Bradwardine of Bradwardine and Tully-Veolan, and that, in the\r\nmeanwhile, his Royal Highness, in his father’s name and authority, has\r\nbeen pleased to grant him an honourable augmentation to his paternal\r\ncoat of arms, being a budget or boot-jack, disposed saltier-wise with a\r\nnaked broadsword, to be borne in the dexter cantle of the shield; and,\r\nas an additional motto, on a scroll beneath, the words, ‘Draw and draw\r\noff.’”\r\n\r\n“Were it not for the recollection of Fergus’s raillery,” thought\r\nWaverley to himself, when he had perused this long and grave document,\r\nhow very tolerably would all this sound, and how little should I have\r\nthought of connecting it with any ludicrous idea! Well, after all,\r\neverything has its fair as well as its seamy side; and truly I do not\r\nsee why the Baron’s boot-jack may not stand as fair in heraldry as the\r\nwater-buckets, waggons, cart-wheels, plough-socks, shuttles,\r\ncandlesticks, and other ordinaries, conveying ideas of anything save\r\nchivalry, which appear in the arms of some of our most ancient gentry.”\r\n\r\nThis, however, is an episode in respect to the principal story.\r\n\r\nWhen Waverley returned to Preston and rejoined Colonel Talbot, he found\r\nhim recovered from the strong and obvious emotions with which a\r\nconcurrence of unpleasing events had affected him. He had regained his\r\nnatural manner, which was that of an English gentleman and soldier,\r\nmanly, open and generous, but not unsusceptible of prejudice against\r\nthose of a different country, or who opposed him in political tenets.\r\nWhen Waverley acquainted Colonel Talbot with the Chevalier’s purpose to\r\ncommit him to his charge, “I did not think to have owed so much\r\nobligation to that young gentleman,” he said, “as is implied in this\r\ndestination. I can at least cheerfully join in the prayer of the honest\r\nPresbyterian clergyman, that, as he has come among us seeking an\r\nearthly crown, his labours may be speedily rewarded with a heavenly\r\none.[*] I shall willingly give my parole not to attempt an escape\r\nwithout your knowledge, since, in fact, it was to meet you that I came\r\nto Scotland; and I am glad it has happened even under this predicament.\r\nBut I suppose we shall be but a short time together. Your Chevalier\r\n(that is a name we may both give to him), with his plaids and blue\r\ncaps, will, I presume, be continuing his crusade southward?”\r\n\r\n[* The clergyman’s name was Mac-Vicar. Protected by the cannon of the\r\nCastle, he preached every Sunday in the West Kirk while the Highlanders\r\nwere in possession of Edinburgh, and it was in presence of some of the\r\nJacobites that he prayed for Prince Charles Edward in the terms quoted\r\nin the text.]\r\n\r\n\r\n“Not as I hear; I believe the army makes some stay in Edinburgh to\r\ncollect reinforcements.”\r\n\r\n“And to besiege the Castle?” said Talbot, smiling sarcastically. “Well,\r\nunless my old commander, General Preston, turn false metal, or the\r\nCastle sink into the North Loch, events which I deem equally probable,\r\nI think we shall have some time to make up our acquaintance. I have a\r\nguess that this gallant Chevalier has a design that I should be your\r\nproselyte; and, as I wish you to be mine, there cannot be a more fair\r\nproposal than to afford us fair conference together. But, as I spoke\r\ntoday under the influence of feelings I rarely give way to, I hope you\r\nwill excuse my entering again upon controversy till we are somewhat\r\nbetter acquainted.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXII.\r\nINTRIGUES OF LOVE AND POLITICS\r\n\r\n\r\nIt is not necessary to record in these pages the triumphant entrance of\r\nthe Chevalier into Edinburgh after the decisive affair at Preston. One\r\ncircumstance, however, may be noticed, because it illustrates the high\r\nspirit of Flora Mac-Ivor. The Highlanders by whom the Prince was\r\nsurrounded, in the license and extravagance of this joyful moment,\r\nfired their pieces repeatedly, and one of these having been\r\naccidentally loaded with ball, the bullet grazed the young lady’s\r\ntemple as she waved her handkerchief from a balcony.[36] Fergus, who\r\nbeheld the accident, was at her side in an instant; and, on seeing that\r\nthe wound was trifling, he drew his broadsword with the purpose of\r\nrushing down upon the man by whose carelessness she had incurred so\r\nmuch danger, when, holding him by the plaid, “Do not harm the poor\r\nfellow,” she cried; “for Heaven’s sake, do not harm him! but thank God\r\nwith me that the accident happened to Flora Mac-Ivor; for had it\r\nbefallen a Whig, they would have pretended that the shot was fired on\r\npurpose.”\r\n\r\nWaverley escaped the alarm which this accident would have occasioned to\r\nhim, as he was unavoidably delayed by the necessity of accompanying\r\nColonel Talbot to Edinburgh.\r\n\r\nThey performed the journey together on horseback, and for some time, as\r\nif to sound each other’s feelings and sentiments, they conversed upon\r\ngeneral and ordinary topics.\r\n\r\nWhen Waverley again entered upon the subject which he had most at\r\nheart, the situation, namely, of his father and his uncle, Colonel\r\nTalbot seemed now rather desirous to alleviate than to aggravate his\r\nanxiety. This appeared particularly to be the case when he heard\r\nWaverley’s history, which he did not scruple to confide to him.\r\n\r\n“And so,” said the Colonel, “there has been no malice prepense, as\r\nlawyers, I think, term it, in this rash step of yours; and you have\r\nbeen trepanned into the service of this Italian knight-errant by a few\r\ncivil speeches from him and one or two of his Highland recruiting\r\nsergeants? It is sadly foolish, to be sure, but not nearly so bad as I\r\nwas led to expect. However, you cannot desert, even from the Pretender,\r\nat the present moment; that seems impossible. But I have little doubt\r\nthat, in the dissensions incident to this heterogeneous mass of wild\r\nand desperate men, some opportunity may arise, by availing yourself of\r\nwhich you may extricate yourself honourably from your rash engagement\r\nbefore the bubble burst. If this can be managed, I would have you go to\r\na place of safety in Flanders which I shall point out. And I think I\r\ncan secure your pardon from government after a few months’ residence\r\nabroad.”\r\n\r\n“I cannot permit you, Colonel Talbot,” answered Waverley, “to speak of\r\nany plan which turns on my deserting an enterprise in which I may have\r\nengaged hastily, but certainly voluntarily, and with the purpose of\r\nabiding the issue.”\r\n\r\n“Well,” said Colonel Talbot, smiling, “leave me my thoughts and hopes\r\nat least at liberty, if not my speech. But have you never examined your\r\nmysterious packet?”\r\n\r\n“It is in my baggage,” replied Edward; “we shall find it in Edinburgh.”\r\n\r\nIn Edinburgh they soon arrived. Waverley’s quarters had been assigned\r\nto him, by the Prince’s express orders, in a handsome lodging, where\r\nthere was accommodation for Colonel Talbot. His first business was to\r\nexamine his portmanteau, and, after a very short search, out tumbled\r\nthe expected packet. Waverley opened it eagerly. Under a blank cover,\r\nsimply addressed to E. Waverley, Esq., he found a number of open\r\nletters. The uppermost were two from Colonel Gardiner addressed to\r\nhimself. The earliest in date was a kind and gentle remonstrance for\r\nneglect of the writer’s advice respecting the disposal of his time\r\nduring his leave of absence, the renewal of which, he reminded Captain\r\nWaverley, would speedily expire. “Indeed,” the letter proceeded, “had\r\nit been otherwise, the news from abroad and my instructions from the\r\nWar Office must have compelled me to recall it, as there is great\r\ndanger, since the disaster in Flanders, both of foreign invasion and\r\ninsurrection among the disaffected at home. I therefore entreat you\r\nwill repair as soon as possible to the headquarters of the regiment;\r\nand I am concerned to add that this is still the more necessary as\r\nthere is some discontent in your troop, and I postpone inquiry into\r\nparticulars until I can have the advantage of your assistance.”\r\n\r\nThe second letter, dated eight days later, was in such a style as might\r\nhave been expected from the Colonel’s receiving no answer to the first.\r\nIt reminded Waverley of his duty as a man of honour, an officer, and a\r\nBriton; took notice of the increasing dissatisfaction of his men, and\r\nthat some of them had been heard to hint that their Captain encouraged\r\nand approved of their mutinous behaviour; and, finally, the writer\r\nexpressed the utmost regret and surprise that he had not obeyed his\r\ncommands by repairing to headquarters, reminded him that his leave of\r\nabsence had been recalled, and conjured him, in a style in which\r\npaternal remonstrance was mingled with military authority, to redeem\r\nhis error by immediately joining his regiment. “That I may be certain,”\r\nconcluded the letter, “that this actually reaches you, I despatch it by\r\nCorporal Tims of your troop, with orders to deliver it into your own\r\nhand.”\r\n\r\nUpon reading these letters Waverley, with great bitterness of feeling,\r\nwas compelled to make the _amende honorable_ to the memory of the brave\r\nand excellent writer; for surely, as Colonel Gardiner must have had\r\nevery reason to conclude they had come safely to hand, less could not\r\nfollow, on their being neglected, than that third and final summons,\r\nwhich Waverley actually received at Glennaquoich, though too late to\r\nobey it. And his being superseded, in consequence of his apparent\r\nneglect of this last command, was so far from being a harsh or severe\r\nproceeding, that it was plainly inevitable. The next letter he unfolded\r\nwas from the major of the regiment, acquainting him that a report to\r\nthe disadvantage of his reputation was public in the country, stating,\r\nthat one Mr. Falconer of Ballihopple, or some such name, had proposed\r\nin his presence a treasonable toast, which he permitted to pass in\r\nsilence, although it was so gross an affront to the royal family that a\r\ngentleman in company, not remarkable for his zeal for government, had\r\nnever-the-less taken the matter up, and that, supposing the account\r\ntrue, Captain Waverley had thus suffered another, comparatively\r\nunconcerned, to resent an affront directed against him personally as an\r\nofficer, and to go out with the person by whom it was offered. The\r\nmajor concluded that no one of Captain Waverley’s brother officers\r\ncould believe this scandalous story, but that it was necessarily their\r\njoint opinion that his own honour, equally with that of the regiment,\r\ndepended upon its being instantly contradicted by his authority, etc.\r\netc. etc.\r\n\r\n“What do you think of all this?” said Colonel Talbot, to whom Waverley\r\nhanded the letters after he had perused them.\r\n\r\n“Think! it renders thought impossible. It is enough to drive me mad.”\r\n\r\n“Be calm, my young friend; let us see what are these dirty scrawls that\r\nfollow.”\r\n\r\nThe first was addressed,—\r\n\r\n_For Master W. Ruffin, These._\r\n\r\n\r\n“DEAR SUR, sum of our yong gulpins will not bite, thof I tuold them you\r\nshoed me the squoire’s own seel. But Tims will deliver you the lettrs\r\nas desired, and tell ould Addem he gave them to squoir’s hond, as to be\r\nsure yours is the same, and shall be ready for signal, and hoy for Hoy\r\nChurch and Sachefrel, as fadur sings at harvestwhome.\r\n\r\n\r\nYours, deer Sur,\r\n“H. H.\r\n\r\n\r\n“Poscriff.—Do’e tell squoire we longs to heer from him, and has\r\ndootings about his not writing himself, and Lifetenant Bottler is\r\nsmoky.”\r\n\r\n\r\n“This Ruffin, I suppose, then, is your Donald of the Cavern, who has\r\nintercepted your letters, and carried on a correspondence with the poor\r\ndevil Houghton, as if under your authority?”\r\n\r\n“It seems too true. But who can Addem be?”\r\n\r\n“Possibly Adam, for poor Gardiner, a sort of pun on his name.”\r\n\r\nThe other letters were to the same purpose; and they soon received yet\r\nmore complete light upon Donald Bean’s machinations.\r\n\r\nJohn Hodges, one of Waverley’s servants, who had remained with the\r\nregiment and had been taken at Preston, now made his appearance. He had\r\nsought out his master with the purpose of again entering his service.\r\nFrom this fellow they learned that some time after Waverley had gone\r\nfrom the headquarters of the regiment, a pedlar, called Ruthven, Rufnn,\r\nor Rivane, known among the soldiers by the name of Wily Will, had made\r\nfrequent visits to the town of Dundee. He appeared to possess plenty of\r\nmoney, sold his commodities very cheap, seemed always willing to treat\r\nhis friends at the ale-house, and easily ingratiated himself with many\r\nof Waverley’s troop, particularly Sergeant Houghton and one Tims, also\r\na non-commissioned officer. To these he unfolded, in Waverley’s name, a\r\nplan for leaving the regiment and joining him in the Highlands, where\r\nreport said the clans had already taken arms in great numbers. The men,\r\nwho had been educated as Jacobites, so far as they had any opinion at\r\nall, and who knew their landlord, Sir Everard, had always been supposed\r\nto hold such tenets, easily fell into the snare. That Waverley was at a\r\ndistance in the Highlands was received as a sufficient excuse for\r\ntransmitting his letters through the medium of the pedlar; and the\r\nsight of his well-known seal seemed to authenticate the negotiations in\r\nhis name, where writing might have been dangerous. The cabal, however,\r\nbegan to take air, from the premature mutinous language of those\r\nconcerned. Wily Will justified his appellative; for, after suspicion\r\narose, he was seen no more. When the “Gazette” appeared in which\r\nWaverley was superseded, great part of his troop broke out into actual\r\nmutiny, but were surrounded and disarmed by the rest of the regiment.\r\nIn consequence of the sentence of a court-martial, Houghton and Tims\r\nwere condemned to be shot, but afterwards permitted to cast lots for\r\nlife. Houghton, the survivor, showed much penitence, being convinced,\r\nfrom the rebukes and explanations of Colonel Gardiner, that he had\r\nreally engaged in a very heinous crime. It is remarkable that, as soon\r\nas the poor fellow was satisfied of this, he became also convinced that\r\nthe instigator had acted without authority from Edward, saying, “If it\r\nwas dishonourable and against Old England, the squire could know nought\r\nabout it; he never did, or thought to do, anything dishonourable, no\r\nmore didn’t Sir Everard, nor none of them afore him, and in that belief\r\nhe would live and die that Ruffin had done it all of his own head.”\r\n\r\nThe strength of conviction with which he expressed himself upon this\r\nsubject, as well as his assurances that the letters intended for\r\nWaverley had been delivered to Ruthven, made that revolution in Colonel\r\nGardiner’s opinion which he expressed to Talbot.\r\n\r\nThe reader has long since understood that Donald Bean Lean played the\r\npart of tempter on this occasion. His motives were shortly these. Of an\r\nactive and intriguing spirit, he had been long employed as a subaltern\r\nagent and spy by those in the confidence of the Chevalier, to an extent\r\nbeyond what was suspected even by Fergus Mac-Ivor, whom, though obliged\r\nto him for protection, he regarded with fear and dislike. To success in\r\nthis political department he naturally looked for raising himself by\r\nsome bold stroke above his present hazardous and precarious trade of\r\nrapine. He was particularly employed in learning the strength of the\r\nregiments in Scotland, the character of the officers, etc., and had\r\nlong had his eye upon Waverley’s troop as open to temptation. Donald\r\neven believed that Waverley himself was at bottom in the Stuart\r\ninterest, which seemed confirmed by his long visit to the Jacobite\r\nBaron of Bradwardine. When, therefore, he came to his cave with one of\r\nGlennaquoich’s attendants, the robber, who could never appreciate his\r\nreal motive, which was mere curiosity, was so sanguine as to hope that\r\nhis own talents were to be employed in some intrigue of consequence,\r\nunder the auspices of this wealthy young Englishman. Nor was he\r\nundeceived by Waverley’s neglecting all hints and openings afforded for\r\nexplanation. His conduct passed for prudent reserve, and somewhat\r\npiqued Donald Bean, who, supposing himself left out of a secret where\r\nconfidence promised to be advantageous, determined to have his share in\r\nthe drama, whether a regular part were assigned him or not. For this\r\npurpose during Waverley’s sleep he possessed himself of his seal, as a\r\ntoken to be used to any of the troopers whom he might discover to be\r\npossessed of the captain’s confidence. His first journey to Dundee, the\r\ntown where the regiment was quartered, undeceived him in his original\r\nsupposition, but opened to him a new field of action. He knew there\r\nwould be no service so well rewarded by the friends of the Chevalier as\r\nseducing a part of the regular army to his standard. For this purpose\r\nhe opened the machinations with which the reader is already acquainted,\r\nand which form a clue to all the intricacies and obscurities of the\r\nnarrative previous to Waverley’s leaving Glennaquoich.\r\n\r\nBy Colonel Talbot’s advice, Waverley declined detaining in his service\r\nthe lad whose evidence had thrown additional light on these intrigues.\r\nHe represented to him, that it would be doing the man an injury to\r\nengage him in a desperate undertaking, and that, whatever should\r\nhappen, his evidence would go some length at least in explaining the\r\ncircumstances under which Waverley himself had embarked in it. Waverley\r\ntherefore wrote a short state of what had happened to his uncle and his\r\nfather, cautioning them, however, in the present circumstances, not to\r\nattempt to answer his letter. Talbot then gave the young man a letter\r\nto the commander of one of the English vessels of war cruising in the\r\nfrith, requesting him to put the bearer ashore at Berwick, with a pass\r\nto proceed to ——shire. He was then furnished with money to make an\r\nexpeditious journey, and directed to get on board the ship by means of\r\nbribing a fishing-boat, which, as they afterwards learned, he easily\r\neffected.\r\n\r\nTired of the attendance of Callum Beg, who, he thought, had some\r\ndisposition to act as a spy on his motions, Waverley hired as a servant\r\na simple Edinburgh swain, who had mounted the white cockade in a fit of\r\nspleen and jealousy, because Jenny Jop had danced a whole night with\r\nCorporal Bullock of the Fusileers.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXIII.\r\nINTRIGUES OF SOCIETY AND LOVE\r\n\r\n\r\nColonel Talbot became more kindly in his demeanour towards Waverley\r\nafter the confidence he had reposed in him, and, as they were\r\nnecessarily much together, the character of the Colonel rose in\r\nWaverley’s estimation. There seemed at first something harsh in his\r\nstrong expressions of dislike and censure, although no one was in the\r\ngeneral case more open to conviction. The habit of authority had also\r\ngiven his manners some peremptory hardness, notwithstanding the polish\r\nwhich they had received from his intimate acquaintance with the higher\r\ncircles. As a specimen of the military character, he differed from all\r\nwhom Waverley had as yet seen. The soldiership of the Baron of\r\nBradwardine was marked by pedantry; that of Major Melville by a sort of\r\nmartinet attention to the minutiæ and technicalities of discipline,\r\nrather suitable to one who was to manœuvre a battalion than to him who\r\nwas to command an army; the military spirit of Fergus was so much\r\nwarped and blended with his plans and political views, that it was less\r\nthat of a soldier than of a petty sovereign. But Colonel Talbot was in\r\nevery point the English soldier. His whole soul was devoted to the\r\nservice of his king and country, without feeling any pride in knowing\r\nthe theory of his art with the Baron, or its practical minutiæ with\r\nthe Major, or in applying his science to his own particular plans of\r\nambition, like the Chieftain of Glennaquoich. Added to this, he was a\r\nman of extended knowledge and cultivated taste, although strongly\r\ntinged, as we have already observed, with those prejudices which are\r\npeculiarly English.\r\n\r\nThe character of Colonel Talbot dawned upon Edward by degrees; for the\r\ndelay of the Highlanders in the fruitless siege of Edinburgh Castle\r\noccupied several weeks, during which Waverley had little to do\r\nexcepting to seek such amusement as society afforded. He would\r\nwillingly have persuaded his new friend to become acquainted with some\r\nof his former intimates. But the Colonel, after one or two visits,\r\nshook his head, and declined farther experiment. Indeed he went\r\nfarther, and characterised the Baron as the most intolerable formal\r\npedant he had ever had the misfortune to meet with, and the Chief of\r\nGlennaquoich as a Frenchified Scotchman, possessing all the cunning and\r\nplausibility of the nation where he was educated, with the proud,\r\nvindictive, and turbulent humour of that of his birth. “If the devil,”\r\nhe said, “had sought out an agent expressly for the purpose of\r\nembroiling this miserable country, I do not think he could find a\r\nbetter than such a fellow as this, whose temper seems equally active,\r\nsupple, and mischievous, and who is followed, and implicitly obeyed, by\r\na gang of such cut-throats as those whom you are pleased to admire so\r\nmuch.”\r\n\r\nThe ladies of the party did not escape his censure. He allowed that\r\nFlora Mac-Ivor was a fine woman, and Rose Bradwardine a pretty girl.\r\nBut he alleged that the former destroyed the effect of her beauty by an\r\naffectation of the grand airs which she had probably seen practised in\r\nthe mock court of St. Germains. As for Rose Bradwardine, he said it was\r\nimpossible for any mortal to admire such a little uninformed thing,\r\nwhose small portion of education was as ill adapted to her sex or youth\r\nas if she had appeared with one of her father’s old campaign-coats upon\r\nher person for her sole garment. Now much of this was mere spleen and\r\nprejudice in the excellent Colonel, with whom the white cockade on the\r\nbreast, the white rose in the hair, and the Mac at the beginning of a\r\nname would have made a devil out of an angel; and indeed he himself\r\njocularly allowed that he could not have endured Venus herself if she\r\nhad been announced in a drawing-room by the name of Miss Mac-Jupiter.\r\n\r\nWaverley, it may easily be believed, looked upon these young ladies\r\nwith very different eyes. During the period of the siege he paid them\r\nalmost daily visits, although he observed with regret that his suit\r\nmade as little progress in the affections of the former as the arms of\r\nthe Chevalier in subduing the fortress. She maintained with rigour the\r\nrule she had laid down of treating him with indifference, without\r\neither affecting to avoid him or to shun intercourse with him. Every\r\nword, every look, was strictly regulated to accord with her system, and\r\nneither the dejection of Waverley nor the anger which Fergus scarcely\r\nsuppressed could extend Flora’s attention to Edward beyond that which\r\nthe most ordinary politeness demanded. On the other hand, Rose\r\nBradwardine gradually rose in Waverley’s opinion. He had several\r\nopportunities of remarking that, as her extreme timidity wore off, her\r\nmanners assumed a higher character; that the agitating circumstances of\r\nthe stormy time seemed to call forth a certain dignity of feeling and\r\nexpression which he had not formerly observed; and that she omitted no\r\nopportunity within her reach to extend her knowledge and refine her\r\ntaste.\r\n\r\nFlora Mac-Ivor called Rose her pupil, and was attentive to assist her\r\nin her studies, and to fashion both her taste and understanding. It\r\nmight have been remarked by a very close observer that in the presence\r\nof Waverley she was much more desirous to exhibit her friend’s\r\nexcellences than her own. But I must request of the reader to suppose\r\nthat this kind and disinterested purpose was concealed by the most\r\ncautious delicacy, studiously shunning the most distant approach to\r\naffectation. So that it was as unlike the usual exhibition of one\r\npretty woman affecting to _proner_ another as the friendship of David\r\nand Jonathan might be to the intimacy of two Bond Street loungers. The\r\nfact is that, though the effect was felt, the cause could hardly be\r\nobserved. Each of the ladies, like two excellent actresses, were\r\nperfect in their parts, and performed them to the delight of the\r\naudience; and such being the case, it was almost impossible to discover\r\nthat the elder constantly ceded to her friend that which was most\r\nsuitable to her talents.\r\n\r\nBut to Waverley, Rose Bradwardine possessed an attraction which few men\r\ncan resist, from the marked interest which she took in everything that\r\naffected him. She was too young and too inexperienced to estimate the\r\nfull force of the constant attention which she paid to him. Her father\r\nwas too abstractedly immersed in learned and military discussions to\r\nobserve her partiality, and Flora Mac-Ivor did not alarm her by\r\nremonstrance, because she saw in this line of conduct the most probable\r\nchance of her friend securing at length a return of affection.\r\n\r\nThe truth is, that in her first conversation after their meeting Rose\r\nhad discovered the state of her mind to that acute and intelligent\r\nfriend, although she was not herself aware of it. From that time Flora\r\nwas not only determined upon the final rejection of Waverley’s\r\naddresses, but became anxious that they should, if possible, be\r\ntransferred to her friend. Nor was she less interested in this plan,\r\nthough her brother had from time to time talked, as between jest and\r\nearnest, of paying his suit to Miss Bradwardine. She knew that Fergus\r\nhad the true continental latitude of opinion respecting the institution\r\nof marriage, and would not have given his hand to an angel unless for\r\nthe purpose of strengthening his alliances and increasing his influence\r\nand wealth. The Baron’s whim of transferring his estate to the distant\r\nheir-male, instead of his own daughter, was therefore likely to be an\r\ninsurmountable obstacle to his entertaining any serious thoughts of\r\nRose Bradwardine. Indeed, Fergus’s brain was a perpetual workshop of\r\nscheme and intrigue, of every possible kind and description; while,\r\nlike many a mechanic of more ingenuity than steadiness, he would often\r\nunexpectedly, and without any apparent motive, abandon one plan and go\r\nearnestly to work upon another, which was either fresh from the forge\r\nof his imagination or had at some former period been flung aside half\r\nfinished. It was therefore often difficult to guess what line of\r\nconduct he might finally adopt upon any given occasion.\r\n\r\nAlthough Flora was sincerely attached to her brother, whose high\r\nenergies might indeed have commanded her admiration even without the\r\nties which bound them together, she was by no means blind to his\r\nfaults, which she considered as dangerous to the hopes of any woman who\r\nshould found her ideas of a happy marriage in the peaceful enjoyment of\r\ndomestic society and the exchange of mutual and engrossing affection.\r\nThe real disposition of Waverley, on the other hand, notwithstanding\r\nhis dreams of tented fields and military honour, seemed exclusively\r\ndomestic. He asked and received no share in the busy scenes which were\r\nconstantly going on around him, and was rather annoyed than interested\r\nby the discussion of contending claims, rights, and interests which\r\noften passed in his presence. All this pointed him out as the person\r\nformed to make happy a spirit like that of Rose, which corresponded\r\nwith his own.\r\n\r\nShe remarked this point in Waverley’s character one day while she sat\r\nwith Miss Bradwardine. “His genius and elegant taste,” answered Rose,\r\n“cannot be interested in such trifling discussions. What is it to him,\r\nfor example, whether the Chief of the Macindallaghers, who has brought\r\nout only fifty men, should be a colonel or a captain? and how could Mr.\r\nWaverley be supposed to interest himself in the violent altercation\r\nbetween your brother and young Corrinaschian whether the post of honour\r\nis due to the eldest cadet of a clan or the youngest?”\r\n\r\n“My dear Rose, if he were the hero you suppose him he would interest\r\nhimself in these matters, not indeed as important in themselves, but\r\nfor the purpose of mediating between the ardent spirits who actually do\r\nmake them the subject of discord. You saw when Corrinaschian raised his\r\nvoice in great passion, and laid his hand upon his sword, Waverley\r\nlifted his head as if he had just awaked from a dream, and asked with\r\ngreat composure what the matter was.”\r\n\r\n“Well, and did not the laughter they fell into at his absence of mind\r\nserve better to break off the dispute than anything he could have said\r\nto them?”\r\n\r\n“True, my dear,” answered Flora; “but not quite so creditably for\r\nWaverley as if he had brought them to their senses by force of reason.”\r\n\r\n“Would you have him peacemaker general between all the gunpowder\r\nHighlanders in the army? I beg your pardon, Flora, your brother, you\r\nknow, is out of the question; he has more sense than half of them. But\r\ncan you think the fierce, hot, furious spirits of whose brawls we see\r\nmuch and hear more, and who terrify me out of my life every day in the\r\nworld, are at all to be compared to Waverley?”\r\n\r\n“I do not compare him with those uneducated men, my dear Rose. I only\r\nlament that, with his talents and genius, he does not assume that place\r\nin society for which they eminently fit him, and that he does not lend\r\ntheir full impulse to the noble cause in which he has enlisted. Are\r\nthere not Lochiel, and P—, and M—, and G—, all men of the highest\r\neducation as well as the first talents,—why will he not stoop like them\r\nto be alive and useful? I often believe his zeal is frozen by that\r\nproud cold-blooded Englishman whom he now lives with so much.”\r\n\r\n“Colonel Talbot? He is a very disagreeable person, to be sure. He looks\r\nas if he thought no Scottish woman worth the trouble of handing her a\r\ncup of tea. But Waverley is so gentle, so well informed—”\r\n\r\n“Yes,” said Flora, smiling, “he can admire the moon and quote a stanza\r\nfrom Tasso.”\r\n\r\n“Besides, you know how he fought,” added Miss Bradwardine.\r\n\r\n“For mere fighting,” answered Flora,” I believe all men (that is, who\r\ndeserve the name) are pretty much alike; there is generally more\r\ncourage required to run away. They have besides, when confronted with\r\neach other, a certain instinct for strife, as we see in other male\r\nanimals, such as dogs, bulls, and so forth. But high and perilous\r\nenterprise is not Waverley’s forte. He would never have been his\r\ncelebrated ancestor Sir Nigel, but only Sir Nigel’s eulogist and poet.\r\nI will tell you where he will be at home, my dear, and in his place—in\r\nthe quiet circle of domestic happiness, lettered indolence, and elegant\r\nenjoyments of Waverley-Honour. And he will refit the old library in the\r\nmost exquisite Gothic taste, and garnish its shelves with the rarest\r\nand most valuable volumes; and he will draw plans and landscapes, and\r\nwrite verses, and rear temples, and dig grottoes; and he will stand in\r\na clear summer night in the colonnade before the hall, and gaze on the\r\ndeer as they stray in the moonlight, or lie shadowed by the boughs of\r\nthe huge old fantastic oaks; and he will repeat verses to his beautiful\r\nwife, who will hang upon his arm;—and he will be a happy man.”\r\n\r\nAnd she will be a happy woman, thought poor Rose. But she only sighed\r\nand dropped the conversation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXIV.\r\nFERGUS A SUITOR\r\n\r\n\r\nWaverley had, indeed, as he looked closer into the state of the\r\nChevalier’s court, less reason to be satisfied with it. It contained,\r\nas they say an acorn includes all the ramifications of the future oak,\r\nas many seeds of _tracasserie_ and intrigue as might have done honour\r\nto the court of a large empire. Every person of consequence had some\r\nseparate object, which he pursued with a fury that Waverley considered\r\nas altogether disproportioned to its importance. Almost all had their\r\nreasons for discontent, although the most legitimate was that of the\r\nworthy old Baron, who was only distressed on account of the common\r\ncause.\r\n\r\n“We shall hardly,” said he one morning to Waverley when they had been\r\nviewing the Castle—“we shall hardly gain the obsidional crown, which\r\nyou wot well was made of the roots or grain which takes root within the\r\nplace besieged, or it may be of the herb woodbind, _parietaria_, or\r\npellitory; we shall not, I say, gain it by this same blockade or\r\nleaguer of Edinburgh Castle.” For this opinion he gave most learned and\r\nsatisfactory reasons, that the reader may not care to hear repeated.\r\n\r\nHaving escaped from the old gentleman, Waverley went to Fergus’s\r\nlodgings by appointment, to await his return from Holyrood House. “I am\r\nto have a particular audience to-morrow,” said Fergus to Waverley\r\novernight, “and you must meet me to wish me joy of the success which I\r\nsecurely anticipate.”\r\n\r\nThe morrow came, and in the Chief’s apartment he found Ensign\r\nMaccombich waiting to make report of his turn of duty in a sort of\r\nditch which they had dug across the Castle-hill and called a trench. In\r\na short time the Chief’s voice was heard on the stair in a tone of\r\nimpatient fury: “Callum! why, Callum Beg! _Diaoul!_” He entered the\r\nroom with all the marks of a man agitated by a towering passion; and\r\nthere were few upon whose features rage produced a more violent effect.\r\nThe veins of his forehead swelled when he was in such agitation; his\r\nnostril became dilated; his cheek and eye inflamed; and his look that\r\nof a demoniac. These appearances of half-suppressed rage were the more\r\nfrightful because they were obviously caused by a strong effort to\r\ntemper with discretion an almost ungovernable paroxysm of passion, and\r\nresulted from an internal conflict of the most dreadful kind, which\r\nagitated his whole frame of mortality.\r\n\r\nAs he entered the apartment he unbuckled his broadsword, and throwing\r\nit down with such violence that the weapon rolled to the other end of\r\nthe room, “I know not what,” he exclaimed, “withholds me from taking a\r\nsolemn oath that I will never more draw it in his cause. Load my\r\npistols, Callum, and bring them hither instantly—instantly!” Callum,\r\nwhom nothing ever startled, dismayed, or disconcerted, obeyed very\r\ncoolly. Evan Dhu, upon whose brow the suspicion that his Chief had been\r\ninsulted called up a corresponding storm, swelled in sullen silence,\r\nawaiting to learn where or upon whom vengeance was to descend.\r\n\r\n“So, Waverley, you are there,” said the Chief, after a moment’s\r\nrecollection. “Yes, I remember I asked you to share my triumph, and you\r\nhave come to witness my disappointment we shall call it.” Evan now\r\npresented the written report he had in his hand, which Fergus threw\r\nfrom him with great passion. “I wish to God,” he said, “the old den\r\nwould tumble down upon the heads of the fools who attack and the knaves\r\nwho defend it! I see, Waverley, you think I am mad. Leave us, Evan, but\r\nbe within call.”\r\n\r\n“The Colonel’s in an unco kippage,” said Mrs. Flockhart to Evan as he\r\ndescended; “I wish he may be weel,—the very veins on his brent brow are\r\nswelled like whipcord; wad he no tak something?”\r\n\r\n“He usually lets blood for these fits,” answered the Highland ancient\r\nwith great composure.\r\n\r\nWhen this officer left the room, the Chieftain gradually reassumed some\r\ndegree of composure. “I know, Waverley,” he said, “that Colonel Talbot\r\nhas persuaded you to curse ten times a day your engagement with us;\r\nnay, never deny it, for I am at this moment tempted to curse my own.\r\nWould you believe it, I made this very morning two suits to the Prince,\r\nand he has rejected them both; what do you think of it?”\r\n\r\n“What can I think,” answered Waverley, “till I know what your requests\r\nwere?”\r\n\r\n“Why, what signifies what they were, man? I tell you it was I that made\r\nthem—I to whom he owes more than to any three who have joined the\r\nstandard; for I negotiated the whole business, and brought in all the\r\nPerthshire men when not one would have stirred. I am not likely, I\r\nthink, to ask anything very unreasonable, and if I did, they might have\r\nstretched a point. Well, but you shall know all, now that I can draw my\r\nbreath again with some freedom. You remember my earl’s patent; it is\r\ndated some years back, for services then rendered; and certainly my\r\nmerit has not been diminished, to say the least, by my subsequent\r\nbehaviour. Now, sir, I value this bauble of a coronet as little as you\r\ncan, or any philosopher on earth; for I hold that the chief of such a\r\nclan as the Sliochd nan Ivor is superior in rank to any earl in\r\nScotland. But I had a particular reason for assuming this cursed title\r\nat this time. You must know that I learned accidentally that the Prince\r\nhas been pressing that old foolish Baron of Bradwardine to disinherit\r\nhis male heir, or nineteenth or twentieth cousin, who has taken a\r\ncommand in the Elector of Hanover’s militia, and to settle his estate\r\nupon your pretty little friend Rose; and this, as being the command of\r\nhis king and overlord, who may alter the destination of a fief at\r\npleasure, the old gentleman seems well reconciled to.”\r\n\r\n“And what becomes of the homage?”\r\n\r\n“Curse the homage! I believe Rose is to pull off the queen’s slipper on\r\nher coronation-day, or some such trash. Well, sir, as Rose Bradwardine\r\nwould always have made a suitable match for me but for this idiotical\r\npredilection of her father for the heir-male, it occurred to me there\r\nnow remained no obstacle unless that the Baron might expect his\r\ndaughter’s husband to take the name of Bradwardine (which you know\r\nwould be impossible in my case), and that this might be evaded by my\r\nassuming the title to which I had so good a right, and which, of\r\ncourse, would supersede that difficulty. If she was to be also\r\nViscountess Bradwardine in her own right after her father’s demise, so\r\nmuch the better; I could have no objection.”\r\n\r\n“But, Fergus,” said Waverley, “I had no idea that you had any affection\r\nfor Miss Bradwardine, and you are always sneering at her father.”\r\n\r\n“I have as much affection for Miss Bradwardine, my good friend, as I\r\nthink it necessary to have for the future mistress of my family and the\r\nmother of my children. She is a very pretty, intelligent girl, and is\r\ncertainly of one of the very first Lowland families; and, with a little\r\nof Flora’s instructions and forming, will make a very good figure. As\r\nto her father, he is an original, it is true, and an absurd one enough;\r\nbut he has given such severe lessons to Sir Hew Halbert, that dear\r\ndefunct the Laird of Balmawhapple, and others, that nobody dare laugh\r\nat him, so his absurdity goes for nothing. I tell you there could have\r\nbeen no earthly objection—none. I had settled the thing entirely in my\r\nown mind.”\r\n\r\n“But had you asked the Baron’s consent,” said Waverley, “or Rose’s?”\r\n\r\n“To what purpose? To have spoken to the Baron before I had assumed my\r\ntitle would have only provoked a premature and irritating discussion on\r\nthe subject of the change of name, when, as Earl of Glennaquoich, I had\r\nonly to propose to him to carry his d—d bear and bootjack _party per\r\npale_, or in a scutcheon of pretence, or in a separate shield\r\nperhaps—any way that would not blemish my own coat of arms. And as to\r\nRose, I don’t see what objection she could have made if her father was\r\nsatisfied.”\r\n\r\n“Perhaps the same that your sister makes to me, you being satisfied.”\r\n\r\nFergus gave a broad stare at the comparison which this supposition\r\nimplied, but cautiously suppressed the answer which rose to his tongue.\r\n“O, we should easily have arranged all that. So, sir, I craved a\r\nprivate interview, and this morning was assigned; and I asked you to\r\nmeet me here, thinking, like a fool, that I should want your\r\ncountenance as bride’s-man. Well, I state my pretension—they are not\r\ndenied; the promises so repeatedly made and the patent granted—they are\r\nacknowledged. But I propose, as a natural consequence, to assume the\r\nrank which the patent bestowed. I have the old story of the jealousy of\r\nC—— and M—— trumped up against me. I resist this pretext, and offer to\r\nprocure their written acquiescence, in virtue of the date of my patent\r\nas prior to their silly claims; I assure you I would have had such a\r\nconsent from them, if it had been at the point of the sword. And then\r\nout comes the real truth; and he dares to tell me to my face that my\r\npatent must be suppressed for the present, for fear of disgusting that\r\nrascally coward and _fainéant_ (naming the rival chief of his own\r\nclan), who has no better title to be a chieftain than I to be Emperor\r\nof China, and who is pleased to shelter his dastardly reluctance to\r\ncome out, agreeable to his promise twenty times pledged, under a\r\npretended jealousy of the Prince’s partiality to me. And, to leave this\r\nmiserable driveller without a pretence for his cowardice, the Prince\r\nasks it as a personal favour of me, forsooth, not to press my just and\r\nreasonable request at this moment. After this, put your faith in\r\nprinces!”\r\n\r\n“And did your audience end here?”\r\n\r\n“End? O no! I was determined to leave him no pretence for his\r\ningratitude, and I therefore stated, with all the composure I could\r\nmuster,—for I promise you I trembled with passion,—the particular\r\nreasons I had for wishing that his Royal Highness would impose upon me\r\nany other mode of exhibiting my duty and devotion, as my views in life\r\nmade what at any other time would have been a mere trifle at this\r\ncrisis a severe sacrifice; and then I explained to him my full plan.”\r\n\r\n“And what did the Prince answer?”\r\n\r\n“Answer? Why—it is well it is written, “Curse not the king, no, not in\r\nthy thought!”—why, he answered that truly he was glad I had made him my\r\nconfidant, to prevent more grievous disappointment, for he could assure\r\nme, upon the word of a prince, that Miss Bradwardine’s affections were\r\nengaged, and he was under a particular promise to favour them. “So, my\r\ndear Fergus,” said he, with his most gracious cast of smile, “as the\r\nmarriage is utterly out of question, there need be no hurry, you know,\r\nabout the earldom.” And so he glided off and left me _planté là_.”\r\n\r\n“And what did you do?”\r\n\r\n“I’ll tell you what I _could_ have done at that moment—sold myself to\r\nthe devil or the Elector, whichever offered the dearest revenge.\r\nHowever, I am now cool. I know he intends to marry her to some of his\r\nrascally Frenchmen or his Irish officers, but I will watch them close;\r\nand let the man that would supplant me look well to himself. _Bisogna\r\ncoprirsi, Signor_.”\r\n\r\nAfter some further conversation, unnecessary to be detailed, Waverley\r\ntook leave of the Chieftain, whose fury had now subsided into a deep\r\nand strong desire of vengeance, and returned home, scarce able to\r\nanalyse the mixture of feelings which the narrative had awakened in his\r\nown bosom.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXV.\r\n“TO ONE THING CONSTANT NEVER”\r\n\r\n\r\n“I am the very child of caprice,” said Waverley to himself, as he\r\nbolted the door of his apartment and paced it with hasty steps. “What\r\nis it to me that Fergus Mac-Ivor should wish to marry Rose Bradwardine?\r\nI love her not; I might have been loved by her perhaps; but rejected\r\nher simple, natural, and affecting attachment, instead of cherishing it\r\ninto tenderness, and dedicated myself to one who will never love mortal\r\nman, unless old Warwick, the King-maker, should arise from the dead.\r\nThe Baron too—I would not have cared about his estate, and so the name\r\nwould have been no stumbling-block. The devil might have taken the\r\nbarren moors and drawn off the royal _caligæ_ for anything I would have\r\nminded. But, framed as she is for domestic affection and tenderness,\r\nfor giving and receiving all those kind and quiet attentions which\r\nsweeten life to those who pass it together, she is sought by Fergus\r\nMac-Ivor. He will not use her ill, to be sure; of that he is incapable.\r\nBut he will neglect her after the first month; he will be too intent on\r\nsubduing some rival chieftain or circumventing some favourite at court,\r\non gaining some heathy hill and lake or adding to his bands some new\r\ntroop of caterans, to inquire what she does, or how she amuses herself.\r\n\r\nAnd then will canker sorrow eat her bud,\r\nAnd chase the native beauty from her cheek;\r\nAnd she will look as hollow as a ghost,\r\nAnd dim and meagre as an ague fit,\r\nAnd so she’ll die.\r\n\r\n\r\nAnd such a catastrophe of the most gentle creature on earth might have\r\nbeen prevented if Mr. Edward Waverley had had his eyes! Upon my word, I\r\ncannot understand how I thought Flora so much, that is, so very much,\r\nhandsomer than Rose. She is taller indeed, and her manner more formed;\r\nbut many people think Miss Bradwardine’s more natural; and she is\r\ncertainly much younger. I should think Flora is two years older than I\r\nam. I will look at them particularly this evening.”\r\n\r\nAnd with this resolution Waverley went to drink tea (as the fashion was\r\nSixty Years Since) at the house of a lady of quality attached to the\r\ncause of the Chevalier, where he found, as he expected, both the\r\nladies. All rose as he entered, but Flora immediately resumed her place\r\nand the conversation in which she was engaged. Rose, on the contrary,\r\nalmost imperceptibly made a little way in the crowded circle for his\r\nadvancing the corner of a chair. “Her manner, upon the whole, is most\r\nengaging,” said Waverley to himself.\r\n\r\nA dispute occurred whether the Gaelic or Italian language was most\r\nliquid, and best adapted for poetry; the opinion for the Gaelic, which\r\nprobably might not have found supporters elsewhere, was here fiercely\r\ndefended by seven Highland ladies, who talked at the top of their\r\nlungs, and screamed the company deaf with examples of Celtic\r\n_euphonia_. Flora, observing the Lowland ladies sneer at the\r\ncomparison, produced some reasons to show that it was not altogether so\r\nabsurd; but Rose, when asked for her opinion, gave it with animation in\r\npraise of Italian, which she had studied with Waverley’s assistance.\r\n“She has a more correct ear than Flora, though a less accomplished\r\nmusician,” said Waverley to himself. “I suppose Miss Mac-Ivor will next\r\ncompare Mac-Murrough nan Fonn to Ariosto!”\r\n\r\nLastly, it so befell that the company differed whether Fergus should be\r\nasked to perform on the flute, at which he was an adept, or Waverley\r\ninvited to read a play of Shakspeare; and the lady of the house\r\ngood-humouredly undertook to collect the votes of the company for\r\npoetry or music, under the condition that the gentleman whose talents\r\nwere not laid under contribution that evening should contribute them to\r\nenliven the next. It chanced that Rose had the casting vote. Now Flora,\r\nwho seemed to impose it as a rule upon herself never to countenance any\r\nproposal which might seem to encourage Waverley, had voted for music,\r\nproviding the Baron would take his violin to accompany Fergus. “I wish\r\nyou joy of your taste, Miss Mac-Ivor,” thought Edward, as they sought\r\nfor his book. “I thought it better when we were at Glennaquoich; but\r\ncertainly the Baron is no great performer, and Shakspeare is worth\r\nlistening to.”\r\n\r\n“Romeo and Juliet” was selected, and Edward read with taste, feeling,\r\nand spirit several scenes from that play. All the company applauded\r\nwith their hands, and many with their tears. Flora, to whom the drama\r\nwas well known, was among the former; Rose, to whom it was altogether\r\nnew, belonged to the latter class of admirers. “She has more feeling\r\ntoo,” said Waverley, internally.\r\n\r\nThe conversation turning upon the incidents of the play and upon the\r\ncharacters, Fergus declared that the only one worth naming, as a man of\r\nfashion and spirit, was Mercutio. “I could not,” he said, “quite follow\r\nall his old-fashioned wit, but he must have been a very pretty fellow,\r\naccording to the ideas of his time.”\r\n\r\n“And it was a shame,” said Ensign Maccombich, who usually followed his\r\nColonel everywhere, “for that Tibbert, or Taggart, or whatever was his\r\nname, to stick him under the other gentleman’s arm while he was redding\r\nthe fray.”\r\n\r\nThe ladies, of course, declared loudly in favour of Romeo, but this\r\nopinion did not go undisputed. The mistress of the house and several\r\nother ladies severely reprobated the levity with which the hero\r\ntransfers his affections from Rosalind to Juliet. Flora remained silent\r\nuntil her opinion was repeatedly requested, and then answered, she\r\nthought the circumstance objected to not only reconcilable to nature,\r\nbut such as in the highest degree evinced the art of the poet. “Romeo\r\nis described,” said she, “as a young man peculiarly susceptible of the\r\nsofter passions; his love is at first fixed upon a woman who could\r\nafford it no return; this he repeatedly tells you,—\r\n\r\nFrom love’s weak, childish bow she lives unharmed,\r\n\r\n\r\nand again—\r\n\r\nShe hath forsworn to love.\r\n\r\n\r\nNow, as it was impossible that Romeo’s love, supposing him a reasonable\r\nbeing, could continue to subsist without hope, the poet has, with great\r\nart, seized the moment when he was reduced actually to despair to throw\r\nin his way an object more accomplished than her by whom he had been\r\nrejected, and who is disposed to repay his attachment. I can scarce\r\nconceive a situation more calculated to enhance the ardour of Romeo’s\r\naffection for Juliet than his being at once raised by her from the\r\nstate of drooping melancholy in which he appears first upon the scene\r\nto the ecstatic state in which he exclaims—\r\n\r\nCome what sorrow can,\r\nIt cannot countervail the exchange of joy\r\nThat one short moment gives me in her sight.”\r\n\r\n\r\n“Good now, Miss Mac-Ivor,” said a young lady of quality, “do you mean\r\nto cheat us out of our prerogative? will you persuade us love cannot\r\nsubsist without hope, or that the lover must become fickle if the lady\r\nis cruel? O fie! I did not expect such an unsentimental conclusion.”\r\n\r\n“A lover, my dear Lady Betty,” said Flora, “may, I conceive, persevere\r\nin his suit under very discouraging circumstances. Affection can (now\r\nand then) withstand very severe storms of rigour, but not a long polar\r\nfrost of downright indifference. Don’t, even with _your_ attractions,\r\ntry the experiment upon any lover whose faith you value. Love will\r\nsubsist on wonderfully little hope, but not altogether without it.”\r\n\r\n“It will be just like Duncan Mac-Girdie’s mare,” said Evan, “if your\r\nladyships please, he wanted to use her by degrees to live without meat,\r\nand just as he had put her on a straw a day the poor thing died!”\r\n\r\nEvan’s illustration set the company a-laughing, and the discourse took\r\na different turn. Shortly afterwards the party broke up, and Edward\r\nreturned home, musing on what Flora had said. “I will love my Rosalind\r\nno more,” said he; “she has given me a broad enough hint for that; and\r\nI will speak to her brother and resign my suit. But for a Juliet—would\r\nit be handsome to interfere with Fergus’s pretensions?—though it is\r\nimpossible they can ever succeed; and should they miscarry, what then?\r\nWhy then _alors comme alors_.” And with this resolution of being guided\r\nby circumstances did our hero commit himself to repose.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXVI.\r\nA BRAVE MAN IN SORROW\r\n\r\n\r\nIf my fair readers should be of opinion that my hero’s levity in love\r\nis altogether unpardonable, I must remind them that all his griefs and\r\ndifficulties did not arise from that sentimental source. Even the lyric\r\npoet who complains so feelingly of the pains of love could not forget,\r\nthat at the same time he was “in debt and in drink,” which, doubtless,\r\nwere great aggravations of his distress. There were, indeed, whole days\r\nin which Waverley thought neither of Flora nor Rose Bradwardine, but\r\nwhich were spent in melancholy conjectures on the probable state of\r\nmatters at Waverley-Honour, and the dubious issue of the civil contest\r\nin which he was pledged. Colonel Talbot often engaged him in\r\ndiscussions upon the justice of the cause he had espoused. “Not,” he\r\nsaid, “that it is possible for you to quit it at this present moment,\r\nfor, come what will, you must stand by your rash engagement. But I wish\r\nyou to be aware that the right is not with you; that you are fighting\r\nagainst the real interests of your country; and that you ought, as an\r\nEnglishman and a patriot, to take the first opportunity to leave this\r\nunhappy expedition before the snowball melts.”\r\n\r\nIn such political disputes Waverley usually opposed the common\r\narguments of his party, with which it is unnecessary to trouble the\r\nreader. But he had little to say when the Colonel urged him to compare\r\nthe strength by which they had undertaken to overthrow the government\r\nwith that which was now assembling very rapidly for its support. To\r\nthis statement Waverley had but one answer: “If the cause I have\r\nundertaken be perilous, there would be the greater disgrace in\r\nabandoning it.” And in his turn he generally silenced Colonel Talbot,\r\nand succeeded in changing the subject.\r\n\r\nOne night, when, after a long dispute of this nature, the friends had\r\nseparated and our hero had retired to bed, he was awakened about\r\nmidnight by a suppressed groan. He started up and listened; it came\r\nfrom the apartment of Colonel Talbot, which was divided from his own by\r\na wainscotted partition, with a door of communication. Waverley\r\napproached this door and distinctly heard one or two deep-drawn sighs.\r\nWhat could be the matter? The Colonel had parted from him apparently in\r\nhis usual state of spirits. He must have been taken suddenly ill. Under\r\nthis impression he opened the door of communication very gently, and\r\nperceived the Colonel, in his night-gown, seated by a table, on which\r\nlay a letter and a picture. He raised his head hastily, as Edward stood\r\nuncertain whether to advance or retire, and Waverley perceived that his\r\ncheeks were stained with tears.\r\n\r\nAs if ashamed at being found giving way to such emotion, Colonel Talbot\r\nrose with apparent displeasure and said, with some sternness, “I think,\r\nMr. Waverley, my own apartment and the hour might have secured even a\r\nprisoner against—”\r\n\r\n“Do not say _intrusion_, Colonel Talbot; I heard you breathe hard and\r\nfeared you were ill; that alone could have induced me to break in upon\r\nyou.”\r\n\r\n“I am well,” said the Colonel, “perfectly well.”\r\n\r\n“But you are distressed,” said Edward; “is there anything can be done?”\r\n\r\n“Nothing, Mr. Waverley; I was only thinking of home, and some\r\nunpleasant occurrences there.”\r\n\r\n“Good God, my uncle!” exclaimed Waverley.\r\n\r\n“No, it is a grief entirely my own. I am ashamed you should have seen\r\nit disarm me so much; but it must have its course at times, that it may\r\nbe at others more decently supported. I would have kept it secret from\r\nyou; for I think it will grieve you, and yet you can administer no\r\nconsolation. But you have surprised me,—I see you are surprised\r\nyourself,—and I hate mystery. Read that letter.”\r\n\r\nThe letter was from Colonel Talbot’s sister, and in these words:—\r\n\r\nI received yours, my dearest brother, by Hodges. Sir E. W. and Mr. R.\r\nare still at large, but are not permitted to leave London. I wish to\r\nHeaven I could give you as good an account of matters in the square.\r\nBut the news of the unhappy affair at Preston came upon us, with the\r\ndreadful addition that you were among the fallen. You know Lady Emily’s\r\nstate of health, when your friendship for Sir E. induced you to leave\r\nher. She was much harassed with the sad accounts from Scotland of the\r\nrebellion having broken out; but kept up her spirits, as, she said, it\r\nbecame your wife, and for the sake of the future heir, so long hoped\r\nfor in vain. Alas, my dear brother, these hopes are now ended!\r\nNotwithstanding all my watchful care, this unhappy rumour reached her\r\nwithout preparation. She was taken ill immediately; and the poor infant\r\nscarce survived its birth. Would to God this were all! But although the\r\ncontradiction of the horrible report by your own letter has greatly\r\nrevived her spirits, yet Dr. —— apprehends, I grieve to say, serious,\r\nand even dangerous, consequences to her health, especially from the\r\nuncertainty in which she must necessarily remain for some time,\r\naggravated by the ideas she has formed of the ferocity of those with\r\nwhom you are a prisoner.\r\n    “Do therefore, my dear brother, as soon as this reaches you,\r\n    endeavour to gain your release, by parole, by ransom, or any way\r\n    that is practicable. I do not exaggerate Lady Emily’s state of\r\n    health; but I must not—dare not—suppress the truth. Ever, my dear\r\n    Philip, your most affectionate sister,\r\n\r\n\r\nLUCY TALBOT.\r\n\r\n\r\nEdward stood motionless when he had perused this letter; for the\r\nconclusion was inevitable, that, by the Colonel’s journey in quest of\r\nhim, he had incurred this heavy calamity. It was severe enough, even in\r\nits irremediable part; for Colonel Talbot and Lady Emily, long without\r\na family, had fondly exulted in the hopes which were now blasted. But\r\nthis disappointment was nothing to the extent of the threatened evil;\r\nand Edward, with horror, regarded himself as the original cause of\r\nboth.\r\n\r\nEre he could collect himself sufficiently to speak, Colonel Talbot had\r\nrecovered his usual composure of manner, though his troubled eye\r\ndenoted his mental agony.\r\n\r\n“She is a woman, my young friend, who may justify even a soldier’s\r\ntears.” He reached him the miniature, exhibiting features which fully\r\njustified the eulogium; “and yet, God knows, what you see of her there\r\nis the least of the charms she possesses—possessed, I should perhaps\r\nsay—but God’s will be done.”\r\n\r\n“You must fly—you must fly instantly to her relief. It is not—it shall\r\nnot be too late.”\r\n\r\n“Fly? how is it possible? I am a prisoner, upon parole.”\r\n\r\n“I am your keeper; I restore your parole; I am to answer for you.”\r\n\r\n“You cannot do so consistently with your duty; nor can I accept a\r\ndischarge from you, with due regard to my own honour; you would be made\r\nresponsible.”\r\n\r\n“I will answer it with my head, if necessary,” said Waverley\r\nimpetuously. “I have been the unhappy cause of the loss of your child,\r\nmake me not the murderer of your wife.”\r\n\r\n“No, my dear Edward,” said Talbot, taking him kindly by the hand, “you\r\nare in no respect to blame; and if I concealed this domestic distress\r\nfor two days, it was lest your sensibility should view it in that\r\nlight. You could not think of me, hardly knew of my existence, when I\r\nleft England in quest of you. It is a responsibility, Heaven knows,\r\nsufficiently heavy for mortality, that we must answer for the foreseen\r\nand direct result of our actions; for their indirect and consequential\r\noperation the great and good Being, who alone can foresee the\r\ndependence of human events on each other, hath not pronounced his frail\r\ncreatures liable.”\r\n\r\n“But that you should have left Lady Emily,” said Waverley, with much\r\nemotion, “in the situation of all others the most interesting to a\r\nhusband, to seek a—”\r\n\r\n“I only did my duty,” answered Colonel Talbot, calmly, “and I do not,\r\nought not, to regret it. If the path of gratitude and honour were\r\nalways smooth and easy, there would be little merit in following it;\r\nbut it moves often in contradiction to our interest and passions, and\r\nsometimes to our better affections. These are the trials of life, and\r\nthis, though not the least bitter” (the tears came unbidden to his\r\neyes), “is not the first which it has been my fate to encounter. But we\r\nwill talk of this to-morrow,” he said, wringing Waverley’s hands.\r\n“Good-night; strive to forget it for a few hours. It will dawn, I\r\nthink, by six, and it is now past two. Good-night.”\r\n\r\nEdward retired, without trusting his voice with a reply.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXVII.\r\nEXERTION\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen Colonel Talbot entered the breakfast-parlour next morning, he\r\nlearned from Waverley’s servant that our hero had been abroad at an\r\nearly hour and was not yet returned. The morning was well advanced\r\nbefore he again appeared. He arrived out of breath, but with an air of\r\njoy that astonished Colonel Talbot.\r\n\r\n“There,” said he, throwing a paper on the table, “there is my morning’s\r\nwork. Alick, pack up the Colonel’s clothes. Make haste, make haste.”\r\n\r\nThe Colonel examined the paper with astonishment. It was a pass from\r\nthe Chevalier to Colonel Talbot, to repair to Leith, or any other port\r\nin possession of his Royal Highness’s troops, and there to embark for\r\nEngland or elsewhere, at his free pleasure; he only giving his parole\r\nof honour not to bear arms against the house of Stuart for the space of\r\na twelve-month.\r\n\r\n“In the name of God,” said the Colonel, his eyes sparkling with\r\neagerness, “how did you obtain this?”\r\n\r\n“I was at the Chevalier’s levee as soon as he usually rises. He was\r\ngone to the camp at Duddingston. I pursued him thither, asked and\r\nobtained an audience—but I will tell you not a word more, unless I see\r\nyou begin to pack.”\r\n\r\n“Before I know whether I can avail myself of this passport, or how it\r\nwas obtained?”\r\n\r\n“O, you can take out the things again, you know. Now I see you busy, I\r\nwill go on. When I first mentioned your name, his eyes sparkled almost\r\nas bright as yours did two minutes since. ‘Had you,’ he earnestly\r\nasked, ‘shown any sentiments favourable to his cause?’ ‘Not in the\r\nleast, nor was there any hope you would do so.’ His countenance fell. I\r\nrequested your freedom. ‘Impossible,’ he said; ‘your importance as a\r\nfriend and confidant of such and such personages made my request\r\naltogether extravagant.’ I told him my own story and yours; and asked\r\nhim to judge what my feelings must be by his own. He has a heart, and a\r\nkind one, Colonel Talbot, you may say what you please. He took a sheet\r\nof paper and wrote the pass with his own hand. ‘I will not trust myself\r\nwith my council,’ he said; ‘they will argue me out of what is right. I\r\nwill not endure that a friend, valued as I value you, should be loaded\r\nwith the painful reflections which must afflict you in case of further\r\nmisfortune in Colonel Talbot’s family; nor will I keep a brave enemy a\r\nprisoner under such circumstances. Besides,’ said he, ‘I think I can\r\njustify myself to my prudent advisers by pleading the good effect such\r\nlenity will produce on the minds of the great English families with\r\nwhom Colonel Talbot is connected.’”\r\n\r\n“There the politician peeped out,” said the Colonel.\r\n\r\n“Well, at least he concluded like a king’s son: ‘Take the passport; I\r\nhave added a condition for form’s sake; but if the Colonel objects to\r\nit, let him depart without giving any parole whatever. I come here to\r\nwar with men, but not to distress or endanger women.’”\r\n\r\n“Well, I never thought to have been so much indebted to the Pretend—”\r\n\r\n“To the Prince,” said Waverley, smiling.\r\n\r\n“To the Chevalier,” said the Colonel; “it is a good travelling name,\r\nand which we may both freely use. Did he say anything more?”\r\n\r\n“Only asked if there was anything else he could oblige me in; and when\r\nI replied in the negative, he shook me by the hand, and wished all his\r\nfollowers were as considerate, since some friends of mine not only\r\nasked all he had to bestow, but many things which were entirely out of\r\nhis power, or that of the greatest sovereign upon earth. Indeed, he\r\nsaid, no prince seemed, in the eyes of his followers, so like the Deity\r\nas himself, if you were to judge from the extravagant requests which\r\nthey daily preferred to him.”\r\n\r\n“Poor young gentleman,” said the Colonel, “I suppose he begins to feel\r\nthe difficulties of his situation. Well, dear Waverley, this is more\r\nthan kind, and shall not be forgotten while Philip Talbot can remember\r\nanything. My life—pshaw—let Emily thank you for that; this is a favour\r\nworth fifty lives. I cannot hesitate on giving my parole in the\r\ncircumstances; there it is (he wrote it out in form). And now, how am I\r\nto get off?”\r\n\r\n“All that is settled: your baggage is packed, my horses wait, and a\r\nboat has been engaged, by the Prince’s permission, to put you on board\r\nthe ‘Fox’ frigate. I sent a messenger down to Leith on purpose.”\r\n\r\n“That will do excellently well. Captain Beaver is my particular friend;\r\nhe will put me ashore at Berwick or Shields, from whence I can ride\r\npost to London; and you must entrust me with the packet of papers which\r\nyou recovered by means of your Miss Bean Lean. I may have an\r\nopportunity of using them to your advantage. But I see your Highland\r\nfriend, Glen—— what do you call his barbarous name? and his orderly\r\nwith him; I must not call him his orderly cut-throat any more, I\r\nsuppose. See how he walks as if the world were his own, with the bonnet\r\non one side of his head and his plaid puffed out across his breast! I\r\nshould like now to meet that youth where my hands were not tied: I\r\nwould tame his pride, or he should tame mine.”\r\n\r\n“For shame, Colonel Talbot! you swell at sight of tartan as the bull is\r\nsaid to do at scarlet. You and Mac-Ivor have some points not much\r\nunlike, so far as national prejudice is concerned.”\r\n\r\nThe latter part of this discourse took place in the street. They passed\r\nthe Chief, the Colonel and he sternly and punctiliously greeting each\r\nother, like two duellists before they take their ground. It was evident\r\nthe dislike was mutual. “I never see that surly fellow that dogs his\r\nheels,” said the Colonel, after he had mounted his horse, “but he\r\nreminds me of lines I have somewhere heard—upon the stage, I think:—\r\n\r\nClose behind him\r\nStalks sullen Bertram, like a sorcerer’s fiend,\r\nPressing to be employed.\r\n\r\n\r\n“I assure you, Colonel,” said Waverley, “that you judge too harshly of\r\nthe Highlanders.”\r\n\r\n“Not a whit, not a whit; I cannot spare them a jot; I cannot bate them\r\nan ace. Let them stay in their own barren mountains, and puff and\r\nswell, and hang their bonnets on the horns of the moon, if they have a\r\nmind; but what business have they to come where people wear breeches,\r\nand speak an intelligible language? I mean intelligible in comparison\r\nto their gibberish, for even the Lowlanders talk a kind of English\r\nlittle better than the Negroes in Jamaica. I could pity the Pr——, I\r\nmean the, Chevalier himself, for having so many desperadoes about him.\r\nAnd they learn their trade so early. There is a kind of subaltern imp,\r\nfor example, a sort of sucking devil, whom your friend Glena——\r\nGlenamuck there, has sometimes in his train. To look at him, he is\r\nabout fifteen years; but he is a century old in mischief and villainy.\r\nHe was playing at quoits the other day in the court; a gentleman, a\r\ndecent-looking person enough, came past, and as a quoit hit his shin,\r\nhe lifted his cane; but my young bravo whips out his pistol, like Beau\r\nClincher in the “Trip to the Jubilee,” and had not a scream of Gardez\r\nl’eau from an upper window set all parties a-scampering for fear of the\r\ninevitable consequences, the poor gentleman would have lost his life by\r\nthe hands of that little cockatrice.”\r\n\r\n“A fine character you’ll give of Scotland upon your return, Colonel\r\nTalbot.”\r\n\r\n“O, Justice Shallow,” said the Colonel, “will save me the\r\ntrouble—“Barren, barren, beggars all, beggars all. Marry, good\r\nair,”—and that only when you are fairly out of Edinburgh, and not yet\r\ncome to Leith, as is our case at present.”\r\n\r\nIn a short time they arrived at the seaport.\r\n\r\nThe boat rocked at the pier of Leith,\r\nFull loud the wind blew down the ferry;\r\n    The ship rode at the Berwick Law—\r\n\r\n\r\n“Farewell, Colonel; may you find all as you would wish it! Perhaps we\r\nmay meet sooner than you expect; they talk of an immediate route to\r\nEngland.”\r\n\r\n“Tell me nothing of that,” said Talbot; “I wish to carry no news of\r\nyour motions.”\r\n\r\n“Simply, then, adieu. Say, with a thousand kind greetings, all that is\r\ndutiful and affectionate to Sir Everard and Aunt Rachel. Think of me as\r\nkindly as you can, speak of me as indulgently as your conscience will\r\npermit, and once more adieu.”\r\n\r\n“And adieu, my dear Waverley; many, many thanks for your kindness.\r\nUnplaid yourself on the first opportunity. I shall ever think on you\r\nwith gratitude, and the worst of my censure shall be, Que diable\r\nalloit-il faire dans cette galère?”\r\n\r\nAnd thus they parted, Colonel Talbot going on board of the boat and\r\nWaverley returning to Edinburgh.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXVIII.\r\nTHE MARCH\r\n\r\n\r\nIt is not our purpose to intrude upon the province of history. We shall\r\ntherefore only remind our readers that about the beginning of November\r\nthe Young Chevalier, at the head of about six thousand men at the\r\nutmost, resolved to peril his cause on an attempt to penetrate into the\r\ncentre of England, although aware of the mighty preparations which were\r\nmade for his reception. They set forward on this crusade in weather\r\nwhich would have rendered any other troops incapable of marching, but\r\nwhich in reality gave these active mountaineers advantages over a less\r\nhardy enemy. In defiance of a superior army lying upon the Borders,\r\nunder Field-Marshal Wade, they besieged and took Carlisle, and soon\r\nafterwards prosecuted their daring march to the southward.\r\n\r\nAs Colonel Mac-Ivor’s regiment marched in the van of the clans, he and\r\nWaverley, who now equalled any Highlander in the endurance of fatigue,\r\nand was become somewhat acquainted with their language, were\r\nperpetually at its head. They marked the progress of the army, however,\r\nwith very different eyes. Fergus, all air and fire, and confident\r\nagainst the world in arms, measured nothing but that every step was a\r\nyard nearer London. He neither asked, expected, nor desired any aid\r\nexcept that of the clans to place the Stuarts once more on the throne;\r\nand when by chance a few adherents joined the standard, he always\r\nconsidered them in the light of new claimants upon the favours of the\r\nfuture monarch, who, he concluded, must therefore subtract for their\r\ngratification so much of the bounty which ought to be shared among his\r\nHighland followers.\r\n\r\nEdward’s views were very different. He could not but observe that in\r\nthose towns in which they proclaimed James the Third, “no man cried,\r\nGod bless him.” The mob stared and listened, heartless, stupefied, and\r\ndull, but gave few signs even of that boisterous spirit which induces\r\nthem to shout upon all occasions for the mere exercise of their most\r\nsweet voices. The Jacobites had been taught to believe that the\r\nnorth-western counties abounded with wealthy squires and hardy yeomen,\r\ndevoted to the cause of the White Rose. But of the wealthier Tories\r\nthey saw little. Some fled from their houses, some feigned themselves\r\nsick, some surrendered themselves to the government as suspected\r\npersons. Of such as remained, the ignorant gazed with astonishment,\r\nmixed with horror and aversion, at the wild appearance, unknown\r\nlanguage, and singular garb of the Scottish clans. And to the more\r\nprudent their scanty numbers, apparent deficiency in discipline, and\r\npoverty of equipment seemed certain tokens of the calamitous\r\ntermination of their rash undertaking. Thus the few who joined them\r\nwere such as bigotry of political principle blinded to consequences, or\r\nwhose broken fortunes induced them to hazard all on a risk so\r\ndesperate.\r\n\r\nThe Baron of Bradwardine, being asked what he thought of these\r\nrecruits, took a long pinch of snuff, and answered drily, “that he\r\ncould not but have an excellent opinion of them, since they resembled\r\nprecisely the followers who attached themselves to the good King David\r\nat the cave of Adullam—_videlicet_, every one that was in distress, and\r\nevery one that was in debt, and every one that was discontented, which\r\nthe vulgate renders bitter of soul; and doubtless,” he said, “they will\r\nprove mighty men of their hands, and there is much need that they\r\nshould, for I have seen many a sour look cast upon us.”\r\n\r\nBut none of these considerations moved Fergus. He admired the luxuriant\r\nbeauty of the country, and the situation of many of the seats which\r\nthey passed. “Is Waverley-Honour like that house, Edward?”\r\n\r\n“It is one-half larger.”\r\n\r\n“Is your uncle’s park as fine a one as that?”\r\n\r\n“It is three times as extensive, and rather resembles a forest than a\r\nmere park.”\r\n\r\n“Flora will be a happy woman.”\r\n\r\n“I hope Miss Mac-Ivor will have much reason for happiness unconnected\r\nwith Waverley-Honour.”\r\n\r\n“I hope so too; but to be mistress of such a place will be a pretty\r\naddition to the sum total.”\r\n\r\n“An addition, the want of which, I trust, will be amply supplied by\r\nsome other means.”\r\n\r\n“How,” said Fergus, stopping short and turning upon Waverley—“how am I\r\nto understand that, Mr. Waverley? Had I the pleasure to hear you\r\naright?”\r\n\r\n“Perfectly right, Fergus.”\r\n\r\n“And am I to understand that you no longer desire my alliance and my\r\nsister’s hand?”\r\n\r\n“Your sister has refused mine,” said Waverley, “both directly and by\r\nall the usual means by which ladies repress undesired attentions.”\r\n\r\n“I have no idea,” answered the chieftain, “of a lady dismissing or a\r\ngentleman withdrawing his suit, after it has been approved of by her\r\nlegal guardian, without giving him an opportunity of talking the matter\r\nover with the lady. You did not, I suppose, expect my sister to drop\r\ninto your mouth like a ripe plum the first moment you chose to open\r\nit?”\r\n\r\n“As to the lady’s title to dismiss her lover, Colonel,” replied Edward,\r\n“it is a point which you must argue with her, as I am ignorant of the\r\ncustoms of the Highlands in that particular. But as to my title to\r\nacquiesce in a rejection from her without an appeal to your interest, I\r\nwill tell you plainly, without meaning to undervalue Miss Mac-Ivor’s\r\nadmitted beauty and accomplishments, that I would not take the hand of\r\nan angel, with an empire for her dowry, if her consent were extorted by\r\nthe importunity of friends and guardians, and did not flow from her own\r\nfree inclination.”\r\n\r\n“An angel, with the dowry of an empire,” repeated Fergus, in a tone of\r\nbitter irony, “is not very likely to be pressed upon a ——shire squire.\r\nBut, sir,” changing his tone, “if Flora Mac-Ivor have not the dowry of\r\nan empire, she is _my_ sister; and that is sufficient at least to\r\nsecure her against being treated with anything approaching to levity.”\r\n\r\n“She is Flora Mac-Ivor, sir,” said Waverley, with firmness, “which to\r\nme, were I capable of treating _any_ woman with levity, would be a more\r\neffectual protection.”\r\n\r\nThe brow of the chieftain was now fully clouded; but Edward felt too\r\nindignant at the unreasonable tone which he had adopted to avert the\r\nstorm by the least concession. They both stood still while this short\r\ndialogue passed, and Fergus seemed half disposed to say something more\r\nviolent, but, by a strong effort, suppressed his passion, and, turning\r\nhis face forward, walked sullenly on. As they had always hitherto\r\nwalked together, and almost constantly side by side, Waverley pursued\r\nhis course silently in the same direction, determined to let the chief\r\ntake his own time in recovering the good-humour which he had so\r\nunreasonably discarded, and firm in his resolution not to bate him an\r\ninch of dignity.\r\n\r\nAfter they had marched on in this sullen manner about a mile, Fergus\r\nresumed the discourse in a different tone. “I believe I was warm, my\r\ndear Edward, but you provoke me with your want of knowledge of the\r\nworld. You have taken pet at some of Flora’s prudery, or high-flying\r\nnotions of loyalty, and now, like a child, you quarrel with the\r\nplaything you have been crying for, and beat me, your faithful keeper,\r\nbecause my arm cannot reach to Edinburgh to hand it to you. I am sure,\r\nif I was passionate, the mortification of losing the alliance of such a\r\nfriend, after your arrangement had been the talk of both Highlands and\r\nLowlands, and that without so much as knowing why or wherefore, might\r\nwell provoke calmer blood than mine. I shall write to Edinburgh and put\r\nall to rights; that is, if you desire I should do so; as indeed I\r\ncannot suppose that your good opinion of Flora, it being such as you\r\nhave often expressed to me, can be at once laid aside.”\r\n\r\n“Colonel Mac-Ivor,” said Edward, who had no mind to be hurried farther\r\nor faster than he chose in a matter which he had already considered as\r\nbroken off, “I am fully sensible of the value of your good offices; and\r\ncertainly, by your zeal on my behalf in such an affair, you do me no\r\nsmall honour. But as Miss Mac-Ivor has made her election freely and\r\nvoluntarily, and as all my attentions in Edinburgh were received with\r\nmore than coldness, I cannot, in justice either to her or myself,\r\nconsent that she should again be harassed upon this topic. I would have\r\nmentioned this to you some time since, but you saw the footing upon\r\nwhich we stood together, and must have understood it. Had I thought\r\notherwise I would have earlier spoken; but I had a natural reluctance\r\nto enter upon a subject so painful to us both.”\r\n\r\n“O, very well, Mr. Waverley,” said Fergus, haughtily, “the thing is at\r\nan end. I have no occasion to press my sister upon any man.”\r\n\r\n“Nor have I any occasion to court repeated rejection from the same\r\nyoung lady,” answered Edward, in the same tone.\r\n\r\n“I shall make due inquiry, however,” said the chieftain, without\r\nnoticing the interruption, “and learn what my sister thinks of all\r\nthis, we will then see whether it is to end here.”\r\n\r\n“Respecting such inquiries, you will of course be guided by your own\r\njudgment,” said Waverley. “It is, I am aware, impossible Miss Mac-Ivor\r\ncan change her mind; and were such an unsupposable case to happen, it\r\nis certain I will not change mine. I only mention this to prevent any\r\npossibility of future misconstruction.”\r\n\r\nGladly at this moment would Mac-Ivor have put their quarrel to a\r\npersonal arbitrement, his eye flashed fire, and he measured Edward as\r\nif to choose where he might best plant a mortal wound. But although we\r\ndo not now quarrel according to the modes and figures of Caranza or\r\nVincent Saviola, no one knew better than Fergus that there must be some\r\ndecent pretext for a mortal duel. For instance, you may challenge a man\r\nfor treading on your corn in a crowd, or for pushing you up to the\r\nwall, or for taking your seat in the theatre; but the modern code of\r\nhonour will not permit you to found a quarrel upon your right of\r\ncompelling a man to continue addresses to a female relative which the\r\nfair lady has already refused. So that Fergus was compelled to stomach\r\nthis supposed affront until the whirligig of time, whose motion he\r\npromised himself he would watch most sedulously, should bring about an\r\nopportunity of revenge.\r\n\r\nWaverley’s servant always led a saddle-horse for him in the rear of the\r\nbattalion to which he was attached, though his master seldom rode. But\r\nnow, incensed at the domineering and unreasonable conduct of his late\r\nfriend, he fell behind the column and mounted his horse, resolving to\r\nseek the Baron of Bradwardine, and request permission to volunteer in\r\nhis troop instead of the Mac-Ivor regiment.\r\n\r\n“A happy time of it I should have had,” thought he, after he was\r\nmounted, “to have been so closely allied to this superb specimen of\r\npride and self-opinion and passion. A colonel! why, he should have been\r\na generalissimo. A petty chief of three or four hundred men! his pride\r\nmight suffice for the Cham of Tartary—the Grand Seignior—the Great\r\nMogul! I am well free of him. Were Flora an angel, she would bring with\r\nher a second Lucifer of ambition and wrath for a brother-in-law.”\r\n\r\nThe Baron, whose learning (like Sancho’s jests while in the Sierra\r\nMorena) seemed to grow mouldy for want of exercise, joyfully embraced\r\nthe opportunity of Waverley’s offering his service in his regiment, to\r\nbring it into some exertion. The good-natured old gentleman, however,\r\nlaboured to effect a reconciliation between the two quondam friends.\r\nFergus turned a cold ear to his remonstrances, though he gave them a\r\nrespectful hearing; and as for Waverley, he saw no reason why he should\r\nbe the first in courting a renewal of the intimacy which the chieftain\r\nhad so unreasonably disturbed. The Baron then mentioned the matter to\r\nthe Prince, who, anxious to prevent quarrels in his little army,\r\ndeclared he would himself remonstrate with Colonel Mac-Ivor on the\r\nunreasonableness of his conduct. But, in the hurry of their march, it\r\nwas a day or two before he had an opportunity to exert his influence in\r\nthe manner proposed.\r\n\r\nIn the meanwhile Waverley turned the instructions he had received while\r\nin Gardiner’s dragoons to some account, and assisted the Baron in his\r\ncommand as a sort of adjutant. “Parmi les aveugles un borgne est roi,”\r\nsays the French proverb; and the cavalry, which consisted chiefly of\r\nLowland gentlemen, their tenants and servants, formed a high opinion of\r\nWaverley’s skill and a great attachment to his person. This was indeed\r\npartly owing to the satisfaction which they felt at the distinguished\r\nEnglish volunteer’s leaving the Highlanders to rank among them; for\r\nthere was a latent grudge between the horse and foot, not only owing to\r\nthe difference of the services, but because most of the gentlemen,\r\nliving near the Highlands, had at one time or other had quarrels with\r\nthe tribes in their vicinity, and all of them looked with a jealous eye\r\non the Highlanders’ avowed pretensions to superior valour and utility\r\nin the Prince’s service.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXIX.\r\nTHE CONFUSION OF KING AGRAMANT’S CAMP\r\n\r\n\r\nIt was Waverley’s custom sometimes to ride a little apart from the main\r\nbody, to look at any object of curiosity which occurred on the march.\r\nThey were now in Lancashire, when, attracted by a castellated old hall,\r\nhe left the squadron for half an hour to take a survey and slight\r\nsketch of it. As he returned down the avenue he was met by Ensign\r\nMaccombich. This man had contracted a sort of regard for Edward since\r\nthe day of his first seeing him at Tully-Veolan and introducing him to\r\nthe Highlands. He seemed to loiter, as if on purpose to meet with our\r\nhero. Yet, as he passed him, he only approached his stirrup and\r\npronounced the single word “Beware!” and then walked swiftly on,\r\nshunning all further communication.\r\n\r\nEdward, somewhat surprised at this hint, followed with his eyes the\r\ncourse of Evan, who speedily disappeared among the trees. His servant,\r\nAlick Polwarth, who was in attendance, also looked after the\r\nHighlander, and then riding up close to his master, said,—\r\n\r\n“The ne’er be in me, sir, if I think you’re safe amang thae Highland\r\nrinthereouts.”\r\n\r\n“What do you mean, Alick?” said Waverley.\r\n\r\n“The Mac-Ivors, sir, hae gotten it into their heads that ye hae\r\naffronted their young leddy, Miss Flora; and I hae heard mae than ane\r\nsay, they wadna tak muckle to mak a black-cock o’ ye; and ye ken weel\r\neneugh there’s mony o’ them wadna mind a bawbee the weising a ball\r\nthrough the Prince himsell, an the chief gae them the wink, or whether\r\nhe did or no, if they thought it a thing that would please him when it\r\nwas dune.”\r\n\r\nWaverley, though confident that Fergus Mac-Ivor was incapable of such\r\ntreachery, was by no means equally sure of the forbearance of his\r\nfollowers. He knew that, where the honour of the chief or his family\r\nwas supposed to be touched, the happiest man would be he that could\r\nfirst avenge the stigma; and he had often heard them quote a proverb,\r\n“That the best revenge was the most speedy and most safe.” Coupling\r\nthis with the hint of Evan, he judged it most prudent to set spurs to\r\nhis horse and ride briskly back to the squadron. Ere he reached the end\r\nof the long avenue, however, a ball whistled past him, and the report\r\nof a pistol was heard.\r\n\r\n“It was that deevil’s buckle, Callum Beg,” said Alick; “I saw him whisk\r\naway through amang the reises.”\r\n\r\nEdward, justly incensed at this act of treachery, galloped out of the\r\navenue, and observed the battalion of Mac-Ivor at some distance moving\r\nalong the common in which it terminated. He also saw an individual\r\nrunning very fast to join the party; this he concluded was the intended\r\nassassin, who, by leaping an enclosure, might easily make a much\r\nshorter path to the main body than he could find on horseback. Unable\r\nto contain himself, he commanded Alick to go to the Baron of\r\nBradwardine, who was at the head of his regiment about half a mile in\r\nfront, and acquaint him with what had happened. He himself immediately\r\nrode up to Fergus’s regiment. The chief himself was in the act of\r\njoining them. He was on horseback, having returned from waiting on the\r\nPrince. On perceiving Edward approaching, he put his horse in motion\r\ntowards him.\r\n\r\n“Colonel Mac-Ivor,” said Waverley, without any farther salutation, “I\r\nhave to inform you that one of your people has this instant fired at me\r\nfrom a lurking-place.”\r\n\r\n“As that,” answered Mac-Ivor, “excepting the circumstance of a\r\nlurking-place, is a pleasure which I presently propose to myself, I\r\nshould be glad to know which of my clansmen dared to anticipate me.”\r\n\r\n“I shall certainly be at your command whenever you please; the\r\ngentleman who took your office upon himself is your page there, Callum\r\nBeg.”\r\n\r\n“Stand forth from the ranks, Callum! Did you fire at Mr. Waverley?”\r\n\r\n“No,” answered the unblushing Callum.\r\n\r\n“You did,” said Alick Polwarth, who was already returned, having met a\r\ntrooper by whom he despatched an account of what was going forward to\r\nthe Baron of Bradwardine, while he himself returned to his master at\r\nfull gallop, neither sparing the rowels of his spurs nor the sides of\r\nhis horse. “You did; I saw you as plainly as I ever saw the auld kirk\r\nat Coudingham.”\r\n\r\n“You lie,” replied Callum, with his usual impenetrable obstinacy. The\r\ncombat between the knights would certainly, as in the days of chivalry,\r\nhave been preceded by an encounter between the squires (for Alick was a\r\nstout-hearted Merseman, and feared the bow of Cupid far more than a\r\nHighlander’s dirk or claymore), but Fergus, with his usual tone of\r\ndecision, demanded Callum’s pistol. The cock was down, the pan and\r\nmuzzle were black with the smoke; it had been that instant fired.\r\n\r\n“Take that,” said Fergus, striking the boy upon the head with the heavy\r\npistol-butt with his whole force—“take that for acting without orders,\r\nand lying to disguise it.” Callum received the blow without appearing\r\nto flinch from it, and fell without sign of life. “Stand still, upon\r\nyour lives!” said Fergus to the rest of the clan; “I blow out the\r\nbrains of the first man who interferes between Mr. Waverley and me.”\r\nThey stood motionless; Evan Dhu alone showed symptoms of vexation and\r\nanxiety. Callum lay on the ground bleeding copiously, but no one\r\nventured to give him any assistance. It seemed as if he had gotten his\r\ndeath-blow.\r\n\r\n“And now for you, Mr. Waverley; please to turn your horse twenty yards\r\nwith me upon the common.” Waverley complied; and Fergus, confronting\r\nhim when they were a little way from the line of march, said, with\r\ngreat affected coolness, “I could not but wonder, sir, at the\r\nfickleness of taste which you were pleased to express the other day.\r\nBut it was not an angel, as you justly observed, who had charms for\r\nyou, unless she brought an empire for her fortune. I have now an\r\nexcellent commentary upon that obscure text.”\r\n\r\n“I am at a loss even to guess at your meaning, Colonel Mac-Ivor, unless\r\nit seems plain that you intend to fasten a quarrel upon me.”\r\n\r\n“Your affected ignorance shall not serve you, sir. The Prince—the\r\nPrince himself has acquainted me with your manœuvres. I little thought\r\nthat your engagements with Miss Bradwardine were the reason of your\r\nbreaking off your intended match with my sister. I suppose the\r\ninformation that the Baron had altered the destination of his estate\r\nwas quite a sufficient reason for slighting your friend’s sister and\r\ncarrying off your friend’s mistress.”\r\n\r\n“Did the Prince tell you I was engaged to Miss Bradwardine?” said\r\nWaverley. “Impossible.”\r\n\r\n“He did, sir,” answered Mac-Ivor; “so, either draw and defend yourself\r\nor resign your pretensions to the lady.”\r\n\r\n“This is absolute madness,” exclaimed Waverley, “or some strange\r\nmistake!”\r\n\r\n“Oh, no evasion! draw your sword!” said the infuriated chieftain, his\r\nown already unsheathed.\r\n\r\n“Must I fight in a madman’s quarrel?”\r\n\r\n“Then give up now, and forever, all pretensions to Miss Bradwardine’s\r\nhand.”\r\n\r\n“What title have you,” cried Waverley, utterly losing command of\r\nhimself—“what title have you, or any man living, to dictate such terms\r\nto me?” And he also drew his sword.\r\n\r\nAt this moment the Baron of Bradwardine, followed by several of his\r\ntroop, came up on the spur, some from curiosity, others to take part in\r\nthe quarrel which they indistinctly understood had broken out between\r\nthe Mac-Ivors and their corps. The clan, seeing them approach, put\r\nthemselves in motion to support their Chieftain, and a scene of\r\nconfusion commenced which seamed likely to terminate in bloodshed. A\r\nhundred tongues were in motion at once. The Baron lectured, the\r\nChieftain stormed, the Highlanders screamed in Gaelic, the horsemen\r\ncursed and swore in Lowland Scotch. At length matters came to such a\r\npass that the Baron threatened to charge the Mac-Ivors unless they\r\nresumed their ranks, and many of them, in return, presented their\r\nfirearms at him and the other troopers. The confusion was privately\r\nfostered by old Ballenkeiroch, who made no doubt that his own day of\r\nvengeance was arrived, when, behold! a cry arose of “Room! make way!\r\n_place à Monseigneur! place à Monseigneur!_” This announced the\r\napproach of the Prince, who came up with a party of Fitz-James’s\r\nforeign dragoons that acted as his body-guard. His arrival produced\r\nsome degree of order. The Highlanders reassumed their ranks, the\r\ncavalry fell in and formed squadron, and the Baron and Chieftain were\r\nsilent.\r\n\r\nThe Prince called them and Waverley before him. Having heard the\r\noriginal cause of the quarrel through the villainy of Callum Beg, he\r\nordered him into custody of the provost-marshal for immediate\r\nexecution, in the event of his surviving the chastisement inflicted by\r\nhis Chieftain. Fergus, however, in a tone betwixt claiming a right and\r\nasking a favour, requested he might be left to his disposal, and\r\npromised his punishment should be exemplary. To deny this might have\r\nseemed to encroach on the patriarchal authority of the Chieftains, of\r\nwhich they were very jealous, and they were not persons to be\r\ndisobliged. Callum was therefore left to the justice of his own tribe.\r\n\r\nThe Prince next demanded to know the new cause of quarrel between\r\nColonel Mac-Ivor and Waverley. There was a pause. Both gentlemen found\r\nthe presence of the Baron of Bradwardine (for by this time all three\r\nhad approached the Chevalier by his command) an insurmountable barrier\r\nagainst entering upon a subject where the name of his daughter must\r\nunavoidably be mentioned. They turned their eyes on the ground, with\r\nlooks in which shame and embarrassment were mingled with displeasure.\r\nThe Prince, who had been educated amongst the discontented and mutinous\r\nspirits of the court of St. Germains, where feuds of every kind were\r\nthe daily subject of solicitude to the dethroned sovereign, had served\r\nhis apprenticeship, as old Frederick of Prussia would have said, to the\r\ntrade of royalty. To promote or restore concord among his followers was\r\nindispensable. Accordingly he took his measures.\r\n\r\n“Monsieur de Beaujeu!”\r\n\r\n“Monseigneur!” said a very handsome French cavalry officer who was in\r\nattendance.\r\n\r\n“Ayez la bonté d’aligner ces montagnards la, ainsi que la cavalerie,\r\ns’il vous plait, et de les remettre a la marche. Vous parlez si bien\r\nl’Anglois, cela ne vous donneroit pas beaucoup de peine.”\r\n\r\n“Ah! pas du tout, Monseigneur,” replied Mons. le Comte de Beaujeu, his\r\nhead bending down to the neck of his little prancing highly-managed\r\ncharger. Accordingly he _piaffed_ away, in high spirits and confidence,\r\nto the head of Fergus’s regiment, although understanding not a word of\r\nGaelic and very little English.\r\n\r\n“Messieurs les sauvages Ecossais—dat is, gentilmans savages, have the\r\ngoodness d’arranger vous.”\r\n\r\nThe clan, comprehending the order more from the gesture than the words,\r\nand seeing the Prince himself present, hastened to dress their ranks.\r\n\r\n“Ah! ver well! dat is fort bien!” said the Comte de Beaujeu.\r\n“Gentilmans sauvages! mais, très bien. Eh bien! Qu’est ce que vous\r\nappelez visage, Monsieur?” (to a lounging trooper who stood by him).\r\n“Ah, oui! _face_. Je vous remercie, Monsieur. Gentilshommes, have de\r\ngoodness to make de face to de right par file, dat is, by files. Marsh!\r\nMais, très bien; encore, Messieurs; il faut vous mettre à la marche.\r\nMarchez donc, au nom de Dieu, parce que j’ai oublié le mot Anglais;\r\nmais vous êtes des braves gens, et me comprenez très bien.”\r\n\r\nThe Count next hastened to put the cavalry in motion. “Gentilmans\r\ncavalry, you must fall in. Ah! par ma foi, I did not say fall off! I am\r\na fear de little gross fat gentilman is moche hurt. Ah, mon Dieu! c’est\r\nle Commissaire qui nous a apporté les premières nouvelles de ce maudit\r\nfracas. Je suis trop faché, Monsieur!”\r\n\r\nBut poor Macwheeble, who, with a sword stuck across him, and a white\r\ncockade as large as a pancake, now figured in the character of a\r\ncommissary, being overturned in the bustle occasioned by the troopers\r\nhastening to get themselves in order in the Prince’s presence, before\r\nhe could rally his galloway, slunk to the rear amid the unrestrained\r\nlaughter of the spectators.\r\n\r\n“Eh bien, Messieurs, wheel to de right. Ah! dat is it! Eh, Monsieur de\r\nBradwardine, ayez la bonté de vous mettre à la tête de votre régiment,\r\ncar, par Dieu, je n’en puis plus!”\r\n\r\nThe Baron of Bradwardine was obliged to go to the assistance of\r\nMonsieur de Beaujeu, after he had fairly expended his few English\r\nmilitary phrases. One purpose of the Chevalier was thus answered. The\r\nother he proposed was, that in the eagerness to hear and comprehend\r\ncommands issued through such an indistinct medium in his own presence,\r\nthe thoughts of the soldiers in both corps might get a current\r\ndifferent from the angry channel in which they were flowing at the\r\ntime.\r\n\r\nCharles Edward was no sooner left with the Chieftain and Waverley, the\r\nrest of his attendants being at some distance, than he said, “If I owed\r\nless to your disinterested friendship, I could be most seriously angry\r\nwith both of you for this very extraordinary and causeless broil, at a\r\nmoment when my father’s service so decidedly demands the most perfect\r\nunanimity. But the worst of my situation is, that my very best friends\r\nhold they have liberty to ruin themselves, as well as the cause they\r\nare engaged in, upon the slightest caprice.”\r\n\r\nBoth the young men protested their resolution to submit every\r\ndifference to his arbitration. “Indeed,” said Edward, “I hardly know of\r\nwhat I am accused. I sought Colonel Mac-Ivor merely to mention to him\r\nthat I had narrowly escaped assassination at the hand of his immediate\r\ndependent, a dastardly revenge which I knew him to be incapable of\r\nauthorising. As to the cause for which he is disposed to fasten a\r\nquarrel upon me, I am ignorant of it, unless it be that he accuses me,\r\nmost unjustly, of having engaged the affections of a young lady in\r\nprejudice of his pretensions.”\r\n\r\n“If there is an error,” said the Chieftain, “it arises from a\r\nconversation which I held this morning with his Royal Highness\r\nhimself.”\r\n\r\n“With me?” said the Chevalier; “how can Colonel Mac-Ivor have so far\r\nmisunderstood me?”\r\n\r\nHe then led Fergus aside, and, after five minutes’ earnest\r\nconversation, spurred his horse towards Edward. “Is it possible—nay,\r\nride up, Colonel, for I desire no secrets—is it possible, Mr. Waverley,\r\nthat I am mistaken in supposing that you are an accepted lover of Miss\r\nBradwardine? a fact of which I was by circumstances, though not by\r\ncommunication from you, so absolutely convinced that I alleged it to\r\nVich Ian Vohr this morning as a reason why, without offence to him, you\r\nmight not continue to be ambitious of an alliance which, to an\r\nunengaged person, even though once repulsed, holds out too many charms\r\nto be lightly laid aside.”\r\n\r\n“Your Royal Highness,” said Waverley, “must have founded on\r\ncircumstances altogether unknown to me, when you did me the\r\ndistinguished honour of supposing me an accepted lover of Miss\r\nBradwardine. I feel the distinction implied in the supposition, but I\r\nhave no title to it. For the rest, my confidence in my own merit is too\r\njustly slight to admit of my hoping for success in any quarter after\r\npositive rejection.”\r\n\r\nThe Chevalier was silent for a moment, looking steadily at them both,\r\nand then said, “Upon my word, Mr. Waverley, you are a less happy man\r\nthan I conceived I had very good reason to believe you. But now,\r\ngentlemen, allow me to be umpire in this matter, not as Prince Regent\r\nbut as Charles Stuart, a brother adventurer with you in the same\r\ngallant cause. Lay my pretensions to be obeyed by you entirely out of\r\nview, and consider your own honour, and how far it is well or becoming\r\nto give our enemies the advantage and our friends the scandal of\r\nshowing that, few as we are, we are not united. And forgive me if I\r\nadd, that the names of the ladies who have been mentioned crave more\r\nrespect from us all than to be made themes of discord.”\r\n\r\nHe took Fergus a little apart and spoke to him very earnestly for two\r\nor three minutes, and then returning to Waverley, said, “I believe I\r\nhave satisfied Colonel Mac-Ivor that his resentment was founded upon a\r\nmisconception, to which, indeed, I myself gave rise; and I trust Mr.\r\nWaverley is too generous to harbour any recollection of what is past\r\nwhen I assure him that such is the case. You must state this matter\r\nproperly to your clan, Vich Ian Vohr, to prevent a recurrence of their\r\nprecipitate violence.” Fergus bowed. “And now, gentlemen, let me have\r\nthe pleasure to see you shake hands.”\r\n\r\nThey advanced coldly, and with measured steps, each apparently\r\nreluctant to appear most forward in concession. They did, however,\r\nshake hands, and parted, taking a respectful leave of the Chevalier.\r\n\r\nCharles Edward[37] then rode to the head of the Mac-Ivors, threw\r\nhimself from his horse, begged a drink out of old Ballenkeiroch’s\r\ncantine, and marched about half a mile along with them, inquiring into\r\nthe history and connections of Sliochd nan Ivor, adroitly using the few\r\nwords of Gaelic he possessed, and affecting a great desire to learn it\r\nmore thoroughly. He then mounted his horse once more, and galloped to\r\nthe Baron’s cavalry, which was in front, halted them, and examined\r\ntheir accoutrements and state of discipline; took notice of the\r\nprincipal gentlemen, and even of the cadets; inquired after their\r\nladies, and commended their horses; rode about an hour with the Baron\r\nof Bradwardine, and endured three long stories about Field-Marshal the\r\nDuke of Berwick.\r\n\r\n“Ah, Beaujeu, mon cher ami,” said he, as he returned to his usual place\r\nin the line of march, “que mon métier de prince errant est ennuyant,\r\npar fois. Mais, courage! c’est le grand jeu, après tout.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXX.\r\nA SKIRMISH\r\n\r\n\r\nThe reader need hardly be reminded that, after a council of war held at\r\nDerby on the 5th of December, the Highlanders relinquished their\r\ndesperate attempt to penetrate farther into England, and, greatly to\r\nthe dissatisfaction of their young and daring leader, positively\r\ndetermined to return northward. They commenced their retreat\r\naccordingly, and, by the extreme celerity of their movements,\r\noutstripped the motions of the Duke of Cumberland, who now pursued them\r\nwith a very large body of cavalry.\r\n\r\nThis retreat was a virtual resignation of their towering hopes. None\r\nhad been so sanguine as Fergus Mac-Ivor; none, consequently, was so\r\ncruelly mortified at the change of measures. He argued, or rather\r\nremonstrated, with the utmost vehemence at the council of war; and,\r\nwhen his opinion was rejected, shed tears of grief and indignation.\r\nFrom that moment his whole manner was so much altered that he could\r\nscarcely have been recognised for the same soaring and ardent spirit,\r\nfor whom the whole earth seemed too narrow but a week before. The\r\nretreat had continued for several days, when Edward, to his surprise,\r\nearly on the 12th of December, received a visit from the Chieftain in\r\nhis quarters, in a hamlet about half-way between Shap and Penrith.\r\n\r\nHaving had no intercourse with the Chieftain since their rupture,\r\nEdward waited with some anxiety an explanation of this unexpected\r\nvisit; nor could he help being surprised, and somewhat shocked, with\r\nthe change in his appearance. His eye had lost much of its fire; his\r\ncheek was hollow, his voice was languid, even his gait seemed less firm\r\nand elastic than it was wont; and his dress, to which he used to be\r\nparticularly attentive, was now carelessly flung about him. He invited\r\nEdward to walk out with him by the little river in the vicinity; and\r\nsmiled in a melancholy manner when he observed him take down and buckle\r\non his sword.\r\n\r\nAs soon as they were in a wild sequestered path by the side of the\r\nstream, the Chief broke out—“Our fine adventure is now totally ruined,\r\nWaverley, and I wish to know what you intend to do;—nay, never stare at\r\nme, man. I tell you I received a packet from my sister yesterday, and,\r\nhad I got the information it contains sooner, it would have prevented a\r\nquarrel which I am always vexed when I think of. In a letter written\r\nafter our dispute, I acquainted her with the cause of it; and she now\r\nreplies to me that she never had, nor could have, any purpose of giving\r\nyou encouragement; so that it seems I have acted like a madman. Poor\r\nFlora! she writes in high spirits; what a change will the news of this\r\nunhappy retreat make in her state of mind!”\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nWaverley, who was really much affected by the deep tone of melancholy\r\nwith which Fergus spoke, affectionately entreated him to banish from\r\nhis remembrance any unkindness which had arisen between them, and they\r\nonce more shook hands, but now with sincere cordiality. Fergus again\r\ninquired of Waverley what he intended to do. “Had you not better leave\r\nthis luckless army, and get down before us into Scotland, and embark\r\nfor the Continent from some of the eastern ports that are still in our\r\npossession? When you are out of the kingdom, your friends will easily\r\nnegotiate your pardon; and, to tell you the truth, I wish you would\r\ncarry Rose Bradwardine with you as your wife, and take Flora also under\r\nyour joint protection.”—Edward looked surprised.—“She loves you, and I\r\nbelieve you love her, though, perhaps, you have not found it out, for\r\nyou are not celebrated for knowing your own mind very pointedly.” He\r\nsaid this with a sort of smile.\r\n\r\n“How,” answered Edward, “can you advise me to desert the expedition in\r\nwhich we are all embarked?”\r\n\r\n“Embarked?” said Fergus; “the vessel is going to pieces, and it is full\r\ntime for all who can to get into the long-boat and leave her.”\r\n\r\n“Why, what will other gentlemen do?” answered Waverley, “and why did\r\nthe Highland Chiefs consent to this retreat if it is so ruinous?”\r\n\r\n“O,” replied Mac-Ivor, “they think that, as on former occasions, the\r\nheading, hanging, and forfeiting will chiefly fall to the lot of the\r\nLowland gentry; that they will be left secure in their poverty and\r\ntheir fastnesses, there, according to their proverb, “to listen to the\r\nwind upon the hill till the waters abate.” But they will be\r\ndisappointed; they have been too often troublesome to be so repeatedly\r\npassed over, and this time John Bull has been too heartily frightened\r\nto recover his good-humour for some time. The Hanoverian ministers\r\nalways deserved to be hanged for rascals; but now, if they get the\r\npower in their hands,—as, sooner or later, they must, since there is\r\nneither rising in England nor assistance from France,—they will deserve\r\nthe gallows as fools if they leave a single clan in the Highlands in a\r\nsituation to be again troublesome to government. Ay, they will make\r\nroot-and-branch-work, I warrant them.”\r\n\r\n“And while you recommend flight to me,” said Edward,—“a counsel which I\r\nwould rather die than embrace,—what are your own views?”\r\n\r\n“O,” answered Fergus, with a melancholy air, “my fate is settled. Dead\r\nor captive I must be before tomorrow.”\r\n\r\n“What do you mean by that, my friend?” said Edward. “The enemy is still\r\na day’s march in our rear, and if he comes up, we are still strong\r\nenough to keep him in check. Remember Gladsmuir.”\r\n\r\n“What I tell you is true notwithstanding, so far as I am individually\r\nconcerned.”\r\n\r\n“Upon what authority can you found so melancholy a prediction?” asked\r\nWaverley.\r\n\r\n“On one which never failed a person of my house. I have seen,” he said,\r\nlowering his voice, “I have seen the Bodach Glas.”\r\n\r\n“Bodach Glas?”\r\n\r\n“Yes; have you been so long at Glennaquoich, and never heard of the\r\nGrey Spectre? though indeed there is a certain reluctance among us to\r\nmention him.”\r\n\r\n“No, never.”\r\n\r\n“Ah! it would have been a tale for poor Flora to have told you. Or, if\r\nthat hill were Benmore, and that long blue lake, which you see just\r\nwinding towards yon mountainous country, were Loch Tay, or my own Loch\r\nan Ri, the tale would be better suited with scenery. However, let us\r\nsit down on this knoll; even Saddleback and Ulswater will suit what I\r\nhave to say better than the English hedgerows, enclosures, and\r\nfarmhouses. You must know, then, that when my ancestor, Ian nan\r\nChaistel, wasted Northumberland, there was associated with him in the\r\nexpedition a sort of Southland Chief, or captain of a band of\r\nLowlanders, called Halbert Hall. In their return through the Cheviots\r\nthey quarrelled about the division of the great booty they had\r\nacquired, and came from words to blows. The Lowlanders were cut off to\r\na man, and their chief fell the last, covered with wounds by the sword\r\nof my ancestor. Since that time his spirit has crossed the Vich Ian\r\nVohr of the day when any great disaster was impending, but especially\r\nbefore approaching death. My father saw him twice, once before he was\r\nmade prisoner at Sheriff-Muir, another time on the morning of the day\r\non which he died.”\r\n\r\n“How can you, my dear Fergus, tell such nonsense with a grave face?”\r\n\r\n“I do not ask you to believe it; but I tell you the truth, ascertained\r\nby three hundred years’ experience at least, and last night by my own\r\neyes.”\r\n\r\n“The particulars, for heaven’s sake!” said Waverley, with eagerness.\r\n\r\n“I will, on condition you will not attempt a jest on the subject. Since\r\nthis unhappy retreat commenced I have scarce ever been able to sleep\r\nfor thinking of my clan, and of this poor Prince, whom they are leading\r\nback like a dog in a string, whether he will or no, and of the downfall\r\nof my family. Last night I felt so feverish that I left my quarters and\r\nwalked out, in hopes the keen frosty air would brace my nerves—I cannot\r\ntell how much I dislike going on, for I know you will hardly believe\r\nme. However—I crossed a small footbridge, and kept walking backwards\r\nand forwards, when I observed with surprise by the clear moonlight a\r\ntall figure in a grey plaid, such as shepherds wear in the south of\r\nScotland, which, move at what pace I would, kept regularly about four\r\nyards before me.”\r\n\r\n“You saw a Cumberland peasant in his ordinary dress, probably.”\r\n\r\n“No; I thought so at first, and was astonished at the man’s audacity in\r\ndaring to dog me. I called to him, but received no answer. I felt an\r\nanxious throbbing at my heart, and to ascertain what I dreaded, I stood\r\nstill and turned myself on the same spot successively to the four\r\npoints of the compass. By Heaven, Edward, turn where I would, the\r\nfigure was instantly before my eyes, at precisely the same distance! I\r\nwas then convinced it was the Bodach Glas. My hair bristled and my\r\nknees shook. I manned myself, however, and determined to return to my\r\nquarters. My ghastly visitant glided before me (for I cannot say he\r\nwalked) until he reached the footbridge; there he stopped and turned\r\nfull round. I must either wade the river or pass him as close as I am\r\nto you. A desperate courage, founded on the belief that my death was\r\nnear, made me resolve to make my way in despite of him. I made the sign\r\nof the cross, drew my sword, and uttered, ‘In the name of God, Evil\r\nSpirit, give place!’ ‘Vich Ian Vohr,’ it said, in a voice that made my\r\nvery blood curdle, ‘beware of to-morrow!’ It seemed at that moment not\r\nhalf a yard from my sword’s point; but the words were no sooner spoken\r\nthan it was gone, and nothing appeared further to obstruct my passage.\r\nI got home and threw myself on my bed, where I spent a few hours\r\nheavily enough; and this morning, as no enemy was reported to be near\r\nus, I took my horse and rode forward to make up matters with you. I\r\nwould not willingly fall until I am in charity with a wronged friend.”\r\n\r\nEdward had little doubt that this phantom was the operation of an\r\nexhausted frame and depressed spirits, working on the belief common to\r\nall Highlanders in such superstitions. He did not the less pity Fergus,\r\nfor whom, in his present distress, he felt all his former regard\r\nrevive. With the view of diverting his mind from these gloomy images,\r\nhe offered, with the Baron’s permission, which he knew he could readily\r\nobtain, to remain in his quarters till Fergus’s corps should come up,\r\nand then to march with them as usual. The Chief seemed much pleased,\r\nyet hesitated to accept the offer.\r\n\r\n“We are, you know, in the rear, the post of danger in a retreat.”\r\n\r\n“And therefore the post of honour.”\r\n\r\n“Well,” replied the Chieftain, “let Alick have your horse in readiness,\r\nin case we should be overmatched, and I shall be delighted to have your\r\ncompany once more.”\r\n\r\nThe rear-guard were late in making their appearance, having been\r\ndelayed by various accidents and by the badness of the roads. At length\r\nthey entered the hamlet. When Waverley joined the clan Mac-Ivor,\r\narm-in-arm with their Chieftain, all the resentment they had\r\nentertained against him seemed blown off at once. Evan Dhu received him\r\nwith a grin of congratulation; and even Callum, who was running about\r\nas active as ever, pale indeed, and with a great patch on his head,\r\nappeared delighted to see him.\r\n\r\n“That gallows-bird’s skull,” said Fergus, “must be harder than marble;\r\nthe lock of the pistol was actually broken.”\r\n\r\n“How could you strike so young a lad so hard?” said Waverley, with some\r\ninterest.\r\n\r\n“Why, if I did not strike hard sometimes, the rascals would forget\r\nthemselves.”\r\n\r\nThey were now in full march, every caution being taken to prevent\r\nsurprise. Fergus’s people, and a fine clan regiment from Badenoch,\r\ncommanded by Cluny Mac-Pherson, had the rear. They had passed a large\r\nopen moor, and were entering into the enclosures which surround a small\r\nvillage called Clifton. The winter sun had set, and Edward began to\r\nrally Fergus upon the false predictions of the Grey Spirit. “The ides\r\nof March are not past,” said Mac-Ivor, with a smile; when, suddenly\r\ncasting his eyes back on the moor, a large body of cavalry was\r\nindistinctly seen to hover upon its brown and dark surface. To line the\r\nenclosures facing the open ground and the road by which the enemy must\r\nmove from it upon the village was the work of a short time. While these\r\nmanœuvres were accomplishing, night sunk down, dark and gloomy, though\r\nthe moon was at full. Sometimes, however, she gleamed forth a dubious\r\nlight upon the scene of action.\r\n\r\nThe Highlanders did not long remain undisturbed in the defensive\r\nposition they had adopted. Favoured by the night, one large body of\r\ndismounted dragoons attempted to force the enclosures, while another,\r\nequally strong, strove to penetrate by the highroad. Both were received\r\nby such a heavy fire as disconcerted their ranks and effectually\r\nchecked their progress. Unsatisfied with the advantage thus gained,\r\nFergus, to whose ardent spirit the approach of danger seemed to restore\r\nall its elasticity, drawing his sword and calling out “Claymore!”\r\nencouraged his men, by voice and example, to break through the hedge\r\nwhich divided them and rush down upon the enemy. Mingling with the\r\ndismounted dragoons, they forced them, at the sword-point, to fly to\r\nthe open moor, where a considerable number were cut to pieces. But the\r\nmoon, which suddenly shone out, showed to the English the small number\r\nof assailants, disordered by their own success. Two squadrons of horse\r\nmoving to the support of their companions, the Highlanders endeavoured\r\nto recover the enclosures. But several of them, amongst others their\r\nbrave Chieftain, were cut off and surrounded before they could effect\r\ntheir purpose. Waverley, looking eagerly for Fergus, from whom, as well\r\nas from the retreating body of his followers, he had been separated in\r\nthe darkness and tumult, saw him, with Evan Dhu and Callum, defending\r\nthemselves desperately against a dozen of horsemen, who were hewing at\r\nthem with their long broadswords. The moon was again at that moment\r\ntotally overclouded, and Edward, in the obscurity, could neither bring\r\naid to his friends nor discover which way lay his own road to rejoin\r\nthe rear-guard. After once or twice narrowly escaping being slain or\r\nmade prisoner by parties of the cavalry whom he encountered in the\r\ndarkness, he at length reached an enclosure, and, clambering over it,\r\nconcluded himself in safety and on the way to the Highland forces,\r\nwhose pipes he heard at some distance. For Fergus hardly a hope\r\nremained, unless that he might be made prisoner. Revolving his fate\r\nwith sorrow and anxiety, the superstition of the Bodach Glas recurred\r\nto Edward’s recollection, and he said to himself, with internal\r\nsurprise “What, can the devil speak truth?”[38]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXXI.\r\nCHAPTER OF ACCIDENTS\r\n\r\n\r\nEdward was in a most unpleasant and dangerous situation. He soon lost\r\nthe sound of the bagpipes; and, what was yet more unpleasant, when,\r\nafter searching long in vain and scrambling through many enclosures, he\r\nat length approached the highroad, he learned, from the unwelcome noise\r\nof kettledrums and trumpets, that the English cavalry now occupied it,\r\nand consequently were between him and the Highlanders. Precluded,\r\ntherefore, from advancing in a straight direction, he resolved to avoid\r\nthe English military and endeavour to join his friends by making a\r\ncircuit to the left, for which a beaten path, deviating from the main\r\nroad in that direction, seemed to afford facilities. The path was muddy\r\nand the night dark and cold; but even these inconveniences were hardly\r\nfelt amidst the apprehensions which falling into the hands of the\r\nKing’s forces reasonably excited in his bosom.\r\n\r\nAfter walking about three miles, he at length reached a hamlet.\r\nConscious that the common people were in general unfavourable to the\r\ncause he had espoused, yet desirous, if possible, to procure a horse\r\nand guide to Penrith, where he hoped to find the rear, if not the main\r\nbody, of the Chevalier’s army, he approached the alehouse of the place.\r\nThere was a great noise within; he paused to listen. A round English\r\noath or two, and the burden of a campaign song, convinced him the\r\nhamlet also was occupied by the Duke of Cumberland’s soldiers.\r\nEndeavouring to retire from it as softly as possible, and blessing the\r\nobscurity which hitherto he had murmured against, Waverley groped his\r\nway the best he could along a small paling, which seemed the boundary\r\nof some cottage garden. As he reached the gate of this little\r\nenclosure, his outstretched hand was grasped by that of a female, whose\r\nvoice at the same time uttered, “Edward, is’t thou, man?”\r\n\r\n“Here is some unlucky mistake,” thought Edward, struggling, but gently,\r\nto disengage himself.\r\n\r\n“Naen o’ thy foun, now, man, or the red cwoats will hear thee; they hae\r\nbeen houlerying and poulerying every ane that past alehouse door this\r\nnoight to make them drive their waggons and sick loike. Come into\r\nfeyther’s, or they’ll do ho a mischief.”\r\n\r\n“A good hint,” thought Waverley, following the girl through the little\r\ngarden into a brick-paved kitchen, where she set herself to kindle a\r\nmatch at an expiring fire, and with the match to light a candle. She\r\nhad no sooner looked on Edward than she dropped the light, with a\r\nshrill scream of “O feyther, feyther!”\r\n\r\nThe father, thus invoked, speedily appeared—a sturdy old farmer, in a\r\npair of leather breeches, and boots pulled on without stockings, having\r\njust started from his bed; the rest of his dress was only a\r\nWestmoreland statesman’s robe-de-chambre—that is, his shirt. His figure\r\nwas displayed to advantage by a candle which he bore in his left hand;\r\nin his right he brandished a poker.\r\n\r\n“What hast ho here, wench?”\r\n\r\n“O!” cried the poor girl, almost going off in hysterics, “I thought it\r\nwas Ned Williams, and it is one of the plaid-men.”\r\n\r\n“And what was thee ganging to do wi’ Ned Williams at this time o’\r\nnoight?” To this, which was, perhaps, one of the numerous class of\r\nquestions more easily asked than answered, the rosy-cheeked damsel made\r\nno reply, but continued sobbing and wringing her hands.\r\n\r\n“And thee, lad, dost ho know that the dragoons be a town? Dost ho know\r\nthat, mon? Ad, they’ll sliver thee loike a turnip, mon.”\r\n\r\n“I know my life is in great danger,” said Waverley, “but if you can\r\nassist me, I will reward you handsomely. I am no Scotchman, but an\r\nunfortunate English gentleman.”\r\n\r\n“Be ho Scot or no,” said the honest farmer, “I wish thou hadst kept the\r\nother side of the hallan. But since thou art here, Jacob Jopson will\r\nbetray no man’s bluid; and the plaids were gay canny, and did not do so\r\nmuch mischief when they were here yesterday.” Accordingly, he set\r\nseriously about sheltering and refreshing our hero for the night. The\r\nfire was speedily rekindled, but with precaution against its light\r\nbeing seen from without. The jolly yeoman cut a rasher of bacon, which\r\nCicely soon broiled, and her father added a swingeing tankard of his\r\nbest ale. It was settled that Edward should remain there till the\r\ntroops marched in the morning, then hire or buy a horse from the\r\nfarmer, and, with the best directions that could be obtained, endeavour\r\nto overtake his friends. A clean, though coarse, bed received him after\r\nthe fatigues of this unhappy day.\r\n\r\nWith the morning arrived the news that the Highlanders had evacuated\r\nPenrith, and marched off towards Carlisle; that the Duke of Cumberland\r\nwas in possession of Penrith, and that detachments of his army covered\r\nthe roads in every direction. To attempt to get through undiscovered\r\nwould be an act of the most frantic temerity. Ned Williams (the right\r\nEdward) was now called to council by Cicely and her father. Ned, who\r\nperhaps did not care that his handsome namesake should remain too long\r\nin the same house with his sweetheart, for fear of fresh mistakes,\r\nproposed that Waverley, exchanging his uniform and plaid for the dress\r\nof the country, should go with him to his father’s farm near Ullswater,\r\nand remain in that undisturbed retirement until the military movements\r\nin the country should have ceased to render his departure hazardous. A\r\nprice was also agreed upon, at which the stranger might board with\r\nFarmer Williams if he thought proper, till he could depart with safety.\r\nIt was of moderate amount; the distress of his situation, among this\r\nhonest and simple-hearted race, being considered as no reason for\r\nincreasing their demand.\r\n\r\nThe necessary articles of dress were accordingly procured, and, by\r\nfollowing by-paths known to the young farmer, they hoped to escape any\r\nunpleasant _rencontre_. A recompense for their hospitality was refused\r\nperemptorily by old Jopson and his cherry-cheeked daughter; a kiss paid\r\nthe one and a hearty shake of the hand the other. Both seemed anxious\r\nfor their guest’s safety, and took leave of him with kind wishes.\r\n\r\nIn the course of their route Edward, with his guide, traversed those\r\nfields which the night before had been the scene of action. A brief\r\ngleam of December’s sun shone sadly on the broad heath, which, towards\r\nthe spot where the great north-west road entered the enclosures of Lord\r\nLonsdale’s property, exhibited dead bodies of men and horses, and the\r\nusual companions of war, a number of carrion-crows, hawks, and ravens.\r\n\r\n“And this, then, was thy last field,” said Waverley to himself, his eye\r\nfilling at the recollection of the many splendid points of Fergus’s\r\ncharacter, and of their former intimacy, all his passions and\r\nimperfections forgotten—“here fell the last Vich Ian Vohr, on a\r\nnameless heath; and in an obscure night-skirmish was quenched that\r\nardent spirit, who thought it little to cut a way for his master to the\r\nBritish throne! Ambition, policy, bravery, all far beyond their sphere,\r\nhere learned the fate of mortals. The sole support, too, of a sister\r\nwhose spirit, as proud and unbending, was even more exalted than thine\r\nown; here ended all thy hopes for Flora, and the long and valued line\r\nwhich it was thy boast to raise yet more highly by thy adventurous\r\nvalour!”\r\n\r\nAs these ideas pressed on Waverley’s mind, he resolved to go upon the\r\nopen heath and search if, among the slain, he could discover the body\r\nof his friend, with the pious intention of procuring for him the last\r\nrites of sepulture. The timorous young man who accompanied him\r\nremonstrated upon the danger of the attempt, but Edward was determined.\r\nThe followers of the camp had already stripped the dead of all they\r\ncould carry away; but the country people, unused to scenes of blood,\r\nhad not yet approached the field of action, though some stood fearfully\r\ngazing at a distance. About sixty or seventy dragoons lay slain within\r\nthe first enclosure, upon the highroad, and on the open moor. Of the\r\nHighlanders, not above a dozen had fallen, chiefly those who, venturing\r\ntoo far on the moor, could not regain the strong ground. He could not\r\nfind the body of Fergus among the slain. On a little knoll, separated\r\nfrom the others, lay the carcasses of three English dragoons, two\r\nhorses, and the page Callum Beg, whose hard skull a trooper’s\r\nbroadsword had, at length, effectually cloven. It was possible his clan\r\nhad carried off the body of Fergus; but it was also possible he had\r\nescaped, especially as Evan Dhu, who would never leave his Chief, was\r\nnot found among the dead; or he might be prisoner, and the less\r\nformidable denunciation inferred from the appearance of the Bodach Glas\r\nmight have proved the true one. The approach of a party sent for the\r\npurpose of compelling the country people to bury the dead, and who had\r\nalready assembled several peasants for that purpose, now obliged Edward\r\nto rejoin his guide, who awaited him in great anxiety and fear under\r\nshade of the plantations.\r\n\r\nAfter leaving this field of death, the rest of their journey was\r\nhappily accomplished. At the house of Farmer Williams, Edward passed\r\nfor a young kinsman, educated for the church, who was come to reside\r\nthere till the civil tumults permitted him to pass through the country.\r\nThis silenced suspicion among the kind and simple yeomanry of\r\nCumberland, and accounted sufficiently for the grave manners and\r\nretired habits of the new guest. The precaution became more necessary\r\nthan Waverley had anticipated, as a variety of incidents prolonged his\r\nstay at Fasthwaite, as the farm was called.\r\n\r\nA tremendous fall of snow rendered his departure impossible for more\r\nthan ten days. When the roads began to become a little practicable,\r\nthey successively received news of the retreat of the Chevalier into\r\nScotland; then, that he had abandoned the frontiers, retiring upon\r\nGlasgow; and that the Duke of Cumberland had formed the siege of\r\nCarlisle. His army, therefore, cut off all possibility of Waverley’s\r\nescaping into Scotland in that direction. On the eastern border Marshal\r\nWade, with a large force, was advancing upon Edinburgh; and all along\r\nthe frontier, parties of militia, volunteers, and partizans were in\r\narms to suppress insurrection, and apprehend such stragglers from the\r\nHighland army as had been left in England. The surrender of Carlisle,\r\nand the severity with which the rebel garrison were threatened, soon\r\nformed an additional reason against venturing upon a solitary and\r\nhopeless journey through a hostile country and a large army, to carry\r\nthe assistance of a single sword to a cause which seemed altogether\r\ndesperate. In this lonely and secluded situation, without the advantage\r\nof company or conversation with men of cultivated minds, the arguments\r\nof Colonel Talbot often recurred to the mind of our hero. A still more\r\nanxious recollection haunted his slumbers—it was the dying look and\r\ngesture of Colonel Gardiner. Most devoutly did he hope, as the rarely\r\noccurring post brought news of skirmishes with various success, that it\r\nmight never again be his lot to draw his sword in civil conflict. Then\r\nhis mind turned to the supposed death of Fergus, to the desolate\r\nsituation of Flora, and, with yet more tender recollection, to that of\r\nRose Bradwardine, who was destitute of the devoted enthusiasm of\r\nloyalty, which to her friend hallowed and exalted misfortune. These\r\nreveries he was permitted to enjoy, undisturbed by queries or\r\ninterruption; and it was in many a winter walk by the shores of\r\nUllswater that he acquired a more complete mastery of a spirit tamed by\r\nadversity than his former experience had given him; and that he felt\r\nhimself entitled to say firmly, though perhaps with a sigh, that the\r\nromance of his life was ended, and that its real history had now\r\ncommenced. He was soon called upon to justify his pretensions by reason\r\nand philosophy.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXXII.\r\nA JOURNEY TO LONDON\r\n\r\n\r\nThe family at Fasthwaite were soon attached to Edward. He had, indeed,\r\nthat gentleness and urbanity which almost universally attracts\r\ncorresponding kindness; and to their simple ideas his learning gave him\r\nconsequence, and his sorrows interest. The last he ascribed, evasively,\r\nto the loss of a brother in the skirmish near Clifton; and in that\r\nprimitive state of society, where the ties of affection were highly\r\ndeemed of, his continued depression excited sympathy, but not surprise.\r\n\r\nIn the end of January his more lively powers were called out by the\r\nhappy union of Edward Williams, the son of his host, with Cicely\r\nJopson. Our hero would not cloud with sorrow the festivity attending\r\nthe wedding of two persons to whom he was so highly obliged. He\r\ntherefore exerted himself, danced, sung, played at the various games of\r\nthe day, and was the blithest of the company. The next morning,\r\nhowever, he had more serious matters to think of.\r\n\r\nThe clergyman who had married the young couple was so much pleased with\r\nthe supposed student of divinity, that he came next day from Penrith on\r\npurpose to pay him a visit. This might have been a puzzling chapter had\r\nhe entered into any examination of our hero’s supposed theological\r\nstudies; but fortunately he loved better to hear and communicate the\r\nnews of the day. He brought with him two or three old newspapers, in\r\none of which Edward found a piece of intelligence that soon rendered\r\nhim deaf to every word which the Reverend Mr. Twigtythe was saying upon\r\nthe news from the north, and the prospect of the Duke’s speedily\r\novertaking and crushing the rebels. This was an article in these, or\r\nnearly these words:—\r\n\r\n“Died at his house, in Hill Street, Berkeley Square, upon the 10th\r\ninst., Richard Waverley, Esq., second son of Sir Giles Waverley of\r\nWaverley-Honour, etc. etc. He died of a lingering disorder, augmented\r\nby the unpleasant predicament of suspicion in which he stood, having\r\nbeen obliged to find bail to a high amount to meet an impending\r\naccusation of high-treason. An accusation of the same grave crime hangs\r\nover his elder brother, Sir Everard Waverley, the representative of\r\nthat ancient family; and we understand the day of his trial will be\r\nfixed early in the next month, unless Edward Waverley, son of the\r\ndeceased Richard, and heir to the Baronet, shall surrender himself to\r\njustice. In that case we are assured it is his Majesty’s gracious\r\npurpose to drop further proceedings upon the charge against Sir\r\nEverard. This unfortunate young gentleman is ascertained to have been\r\nin arms in the Pretender’s service, and to have marched along with the\r\nHighland troops into England. But he has not been heard of since the\r\nskirmish at Clifton, on the 18th December last.”\r\n\r\n\r\nSuch was this distracting paragraph. “Good God!” exclaimed Waverley,\r\n“am I then a parricide? Impossible! My father, who never showed the\r\naffection of a father while he lived, cannot have been so much affected\r\nby my supposed death as to hasten his own; no, I will not believe it,\r\nit were distraction to entertain for a moment such a horrible idea. But\r\nit were, if possible, worse than parricide to suffer any danger to hang\r\nover my noble and generous uncle, who has ever been more to me than a\r\nfather, if such evil can be averted by any sacrifice on my part!”\r\n\r\nWhile these reflections passed like the stings of scorpions through\r\nWaverley’s sensorium, the worthy divine was startled in a long\r\ndisquisition on the battle of Falkirk by the ghastliness which they\r\ncommunicated to his looks, and asked him if he was ill? Fortunately the\r\nbride, all smirk and blush, had just entered the room. Mrs. Williams\r\nwas none of the brightest of women, but she was good-natured, and\r\nreadily concluding that Edward had been shocked by disagreeable news in\r\nthe papers, interfered so judiciously, that, without exciting\r\nsuspicion, she drew off Mr. Twigtythe’s attention, and engaged it until\r\nhe soon after took his leave. Waverley then explained to his friends\r\nthat he was under the necessity of going to London with as little delay\r\nas possible.\r\n\r\nOne cause of delay, however, did occur, to which Waverley had been very\r\nlittle accustomed. His purse, though well stocked when he first went to\r\nTully-Veolan, had not been reinforced since that period; and although\r\nhis life since had not been of a nature to exhaust it hastily, for he\r\nhad lived chiefly with his friends or with the army, yet he found that,\r\nafter settling with his kind landlord, he should be too poor to\r\nencounter the expense of travelling post. The best course, therefore,\r\nseemed to be to get into the great north road about Boroughbridge, and\r\nthere take a place in the northern diligence, a huge old-fashioned tub,\r\ndrawn by three horses, which completed the journey from Edinburgh to\r\nLondon (God willing, as the advertisement expressed it) in three weeks.\r\nOur hero, therefore, took an affectionate farewell of his Cumberland\r\nfriends, whose kindness he promised never to forget, and tacitly hoped\r\none day to acknowledge by substantial proofs of gratitude. After some\r\npetty difficulties and vexatious delays, and after putting his dress\r\ninto a shape better befitting his rank, though perfectly plain and\r\nsimple, he accomplished crossing the country, and found himself in the\r\ndesired vehicle _vis-à-vis_ to Mrs. Nosebag, the lady of Lieutenant\r\nNosebag, adjutant and riding-master of the —— dragoons, a jolly woman\r\nof about fifty, wearing a blue habit, faced with scarlet, and grasping\r\na silver-mounted horse-whip.\r\n\r\nThis lady was one of those active members of society who take upon them\r\n_faire le frais de conversation_. She had just returned from the north,\r\nand informed Edward how nearly her regiment had cut the petticoat\r\npeople into ribands at Falkirk, “only somehow there was one of those\r\nnasty, awkward marshes, that they are never without in Scotland, I\r\nthink, and so our poor dear little regiment suffered something, as my\r\nNosebag says, in that unsatisfactory affair. You, sir, have served in\r\nthe dragoons?” Waverley was taken so much at unawares that he\r\nacquiesced.\r\n\r\n“O, I knew it at once; I saw you were military from your air, and I was\r\nsure you could be none of the foot-wobblers, as my Nosebag calls them.\r\nWhat regiment, pray?” Here was a delightful question. Waverley,\r\nhowever, justly concluded that this good lady had the whole army-list\r\nby heart; and, to avoid detection by adhering to truth, answered,\r\n“Gardiner’s dragoons, ma’am; but I have retired some time.”\r\n\r\n“O aye, those as won the race at the battle of Preston, as my Nosebag\r\nsays. Pray, sir, were you there?”\r\n\r\n“I was so unfortunate, madam,” he replied, “as to witness that\r\nengagement.”\r\n\r\n“And that was a misfortune that few of Gardiner’s stood to witness, I\r\nbelieve, sir—ha! ha! ha! I beg your pardon; but a soldier’s wife loves\r\na joke.”\r\n\r\n“Devil confound you,” thought Waverley: “what infernal luck has penned\r\nme up with this inquisitive hag!”\r\n\r\nFortunately the good lady did not stick long to one subject. “We are\r\ncoming to Ferrybridge now,” she said, “where there was a party of\r\n_ours_ left to support the beadles, and constables, and justices, and\r\nthese sort of creatures that are examining papers and stopping rebels,\r\nand all that.” They were hardly in the inn before she dragged Waverley\r\nto the window, exclaiming, “Yonder comes Corporal Bridoon, of our poor\r\ndear troop; he’s coming with the constable man. Bridoon’s one of my\r\nlambs, as Nosebag calls ’em. Come, Mr.—a—a—pray, what’s your name,\r\nsir?”\r\n\r\n“Butler, ma’am,” said Waverley, resolved rather to make free with the\r\nname of a former fellow-officer than run the risk of detection by\r\ninventing one not to be found in the regiment.\r\n\r\n“O, you got a troop lately, when that shabby fellow, Waverley, went\r\nover to the rebels? Lord, I wish our old cross Captain Crump would go\r\nover to the rebels, that Nosebag might get the troop! Lord, what can\r\nBridoon be standing swinging on the bridge for? I’ll be hanged if he\r\na’nt hazy, as Nosebag says. Come, sir, as you and I belong to the\r\nservice, we’ll go put the rascal in mind of his duty.”\r\n\r\nWaverley, with feelings more easily conceived than described, saw\r\nhimself obliged to follow this doughty female commander. The gallant\r\ntrooper was as like a lamb as a drunk corporal of dragoons, about six\r\nfeet high, with very broad shoulders, and very thin legs, not to\r\nmention a great scar across his nose, could well be. Mrs. Nosebag\r\naddressed him with something which, if not an oath, sounded very like\r\none, and commanded him to attend to his duty.\r\n\r\n“You be d—d for a——,” commenced the gallant cavalier; but, looking up\r\nin order to suit the action to the words, and also to enforce the\r\nepithet which he meditated with an adjective applicable to the party,\r\nhe recognised the speaker, made his military salaam, and altered his\r\ntone. “Lord love your handsome face, Madam Nosebag, is it you? Why, if\r\na poor fellow does happen to fire a slug of a morning, I am sure you\r\nwere never the lady to bring him to harm.”\r\n\r\n“Well, you rascallion, go mind your duty; this gentleman and I belong\r\nto the service; but be sure you look after that shy cock in the\r\nslouched hat that sits in the corner of the coach. I believe he’s one\r\nof the rebels in disguise.”\r\n\r\n“D—n her gooseberry wig,” said the corporal, when she was out of\r\nhearing, “that gimlet-eyed jade—mother adjutant, as we call her—is a\r\ngreater plague to the regiment than prévôt-marshal, sergeant-major, and\r\nold Hubble-de-Shuff, the colonel, into the bargain. Come, Master\r\nConstable, let’s see if this shy cock, as she calls him (who, by the\r\nway, was a Quaker from Leeds, with whom Mrs. Nosebag had had some tart\r\nargument on the legality of bearing arms), will stand godfather to a\r\nsup of brandy, for your Yorkshire ale is cold on my stomach.”\r\n\r\nThe vivacity of this good lady, as it helped Edward out of this scrape,\r\nwas like to have drawn him into one or two others. In every town where\r\nthey stopped she wished to examine the _corps de garde_, if there was\r\none, and once very narrowly missed introducing Waverley to a\r\nrecruiting-sergeant of his own regiment. Then she Captain’d and\r\nButler’d him till he was almost mad with vexation and anxiety; and\r\nnever was he more rejoiced in his life at the termination of a journey\r\nthan when the arrival of the coach in London freed him from the\r\nattentions of Madam Nosebag.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXXIII.\r\nWHAT’S TO BE DONE NEXT?\r\n\r\n\r\nIt was twilight when they arrived in town; and having shaken off his\r\ncompanions, and walked through a good many streets to avoid the\r\npossibility of being traced by them, Edward took a hackney-coach and\r\ndrove to Colonel Talbot’s house, in one of the principal squares at the\r\nwest end of the town. That gentleman, by the death of relations, had\r\nsucceeded since his marriage to a large fortune, possessed considerable\r\npolitical interest, and lived in what is called great style.\r\n\r\nWhen Waverley knocked at his door he found it at first difficult to\r\nprocure admittance, but at length was shown into an apartment where the\r\nColonel was at table. Lady Emily, whose very beautiful features were\r\nstill pallid from indisposition, sat opposite to him. The instant he\r\nheard Waverley’s voice, he started up and embraced him. “Frank Stanley,\r\nmy dear boy, how d’ye do? Emily, my love, this is young Stanley.”\r\n\r\nThe blood started to the lady’s cheek as she gave Waverley a reception\r\nin which courtesy was mingled with kindness, while her trembling hand\r\nand faltering voice showed how much she was startled and discomposed.\r\nDinner was hastily replaced, and while Waverley was engaged in\r\nrefreshing himself, the Colonel proceeded—“I wonder you have come here,\r\nFrank; the Doctors tell me the air of London is very bad for your\r\ncomplaints. You should not have risked it. But I am delighted to see\r\nyou, and so is Emily, though I fear we must not reckon upon your\r\nstaying long.”\r\n\r\n“Some particular business brought me up,” muttered Waverley.\r\n\r\n“I supposed so, but I shan’t allow you to stay long. Spontoon” (to an\r\nelderly military-looking servant out of livery), “take away these\r\nthings, and answer the bell yourself, if I ring. Don’t let any of the\r\nother fellows disturb us. My nephew and I have business to talk of.”\r\n\r\nWhen the servants had retired, “In the name of God, Waverley, what has\r\nbrought you here? It may be as much as your life is worth.”\r\n\r\n“Dear Mr. Waverley,” said Lady Emily, “to whom I owe so much more than\r\nacknowledgments can ever pay, how could you be so rash?”\r\n\r\n“My father—my uncle—this paragraph,”—he handed the paper to Colonel\r\nTalbot.\r\n\r\n“I wish to Heaven these scoundrels were condemned to be squeezed to\r\ndeath in their own presses,” said Talbot. “I am told there are not less\r\nthan a dozen of their papers now published in town, and no wonder that\r\nthey are obliged to invent lies to find sale for their journals. It is\r\ntrue, however, my dear Edward, that you have lost your father; but as\r\nto this flourish of his unpleasant situation having grated upon his\r\nspirits and hurt his health—the truth is—for though it is harsh to say\r\nso now, yet it will relieve your mind from the idea of weighty\r\nresponsibility—the truth then is, that Mr. Richard Waverley, through\r\nthis whole business, showed great want of sensibility, both to your\r\nsituation and that of your uncle; and the last time I saw him, he told\r\nme, with great glee, that, as I was so good as to take charge of your\r\ninterests, he had thought it best to patch up a separate negotiation\r\nfor himself, and make his peace with government through some channels\r\nwhich former connections left still open to him.”\r\n\r\n“And my uncle, my dear uncle?”\r\n\r\n“Is in no danger whatever. It is true (looking at the date of the\r\npaper) there was a foolish report some time ago to the purport here\r\nquoted, but it is entirely false. Sir Everard is gone down to\r\nWaverley-Honour, freed from all uneasiness, unless upon your own\r\naccount. But you are in peril yourself; your name is in every\r\nproclamation; warrants are out to apprehend you. How and when did you\r\ncome here?”\r\n\r\nEdward told his story at length, suppressing his quarrel with Fergus;\r\nfor, being himself partial to Highlanders, he did not wish to give any\r\nadvantage to the Colonel’s national prejudice against them.\r\n\r\n“Are you sure it was your friend Glen’s foot-boy you saw dead in\r\nClifton Moor?”\r\n\r\n“Quite positive.”\r\n\r\n“Then that little limb of the devil has cheated the gallows, for\r\ncut-throat was written in his face; though (turning to Lady Emily) it\r\nwas a very handsome face too. But for you, Edward, I wish you would go\r\ndown again to Cumberland, or rather I wish you had never stirred from\r\nthence, for there is an embargo in all the seaports, and a strict\r\nsearch for the adherents of the Pretender; and the tongue of that\r\nconfounded woman will wag in her head like the clack of a mill, till\r\nsomehow or other she will detect Captain Butler to be a feigned\r\npersonage.”\r\n\r\n“Do you know anything,” asked Waverley, “of my fellow-traveller?”\r\n\r\n“Her husband was my sergeant-major for six years; she was a buxom\r\nwidow, with a little money; he married her, was steady, and got on by\r\nbeing a good drill. I must send Spontoon to see what she is about; he\r\nwill find her out among the old regimental connections. To-morrow you\r\nmust be indisposed, and keep your room from fatigue. Lady Emily is to\r\nbe your nurse, and Spontoon and I your attendants. You bear the name of\r\na near relation of mine, whom none of my present people ever saw,\r\nexcept Spontoon, so there will be no immediate danger. So pray feel\r\nyour head ache and your eyes grow heavy as soon as possible, that you\r\nmay be put upon the sick-list; and, Emily, do you order an apartment\r\nfor Frank Stanley, with all the attentions which an invalid may\r\nrequire.”\r\n\r\nIn the morning the Colonel visited his guest. “Now,” said he, “I have\r\nsome good news for you. Your reputation as a gentleman and officer is\r\neffectually cleared of neglect of duty and accession to the mutiny in\r\nGardiner’s regiment. I have had a correspondence on this subject with a\r\nvery zealous friend of yours, your Scottish parson, Morton; his first\r\nletter was addressed to Sir Everard; but I relieved the good Baronet of\r\nthe trouble of answering it. You must know, that your free-booting\r\nacquaintance, Donald of the Cave, has at length fallen into the hands\r\nof the Philistines. He was driving off the cattle of a certain\r\nproprietor, called Killan—something or other—”\r\n\r\n“Killancureit?”\r\n\r\n“The same. Now the gentleman being, it seems, a great farmer, and\r\nhaving a special value for his breed of cattle, being, moreover, rather\r\nof a timid disposition, had got a party of soldiers to protect his\r\nproperty. So Donald ran his head unawares into the lion’s mouth, and\r\nwas defeated and made prisoner. Being ordered for execution, his\r\nconscience was assailed on the one hand by a Catholic priest, on the\r\nother by your friend Morton. He repulsed the Catholic chiefly on\r\naccount of the doctrine of extreme unction, which this economical\r\ngentleman considered as an excessive waste of oil. So his conversion\r\nfrom a state of impenitence fell to Mr. Morton’s share, who, I daresay,\r\nacquitted himself excellently, though I suppose Donald made but a queer\r\nkind of Christian after all. He confessed, however, before a\r\nmagistrate, one Major Melville, who seems to have been a correct,\r\nfriendly sort of person, his full intrigue with Houghton, explaining\r\nparticularly how it was carried on, and fully acquitting you of the\r\nleast accession to it. He also mentioned his rescuing you from the\r\nhands of the volunteer officer, and sending you, by orders of the\r\nPret—Chevalier, I mean—as a prisoner to Doune, from whence he\r\nunderstood you were carried prisoner to Edinburgh. These are\r\nparticulars which cannot but tell in your favour. He hinted that he had\r\nbeen employed to deliver and protect you, and rewarded for doing so;\r\nbut he would not confess by whom, alleging that, though he would not\r\nhave minded breaking any ordinary oath to satisfy the curiosity of Mr.\r\nMorton, to whose pious admonitions he owed so much, yet, in the present\r\ncase he had been sworn to silence upon the edge of his dirk,[39] which,\r\nit seems, constituted, in his opinion, an inviolable obligation.”\r\n\r\n“And what is become of him?”\r\n\r\n“Oh, he was hanged at Stirling after the rebels raised the siege, with\r\nhis lieutenant and four plaids besides; he having the advantage of a\r\ngallows more lofty than his friends.”\r\n\r\n“Well, I have little cause either to regret or rejoice at his death;\r\nand yet he has done me both good and harm to a very considerable\r\nextent.”\r\n\r\n“His confession, at least, will serve you materially, since it wipes\r\nfrom your character all those suspicions which gave the accusation\r\nagainst you a complexion of a nature different from that with which so\r\nmany unfortunate gentlemen, now or lately in arms against the\r\ngovernment, may be justly charged. Their treason—I must give it its\r\nname, though you participate in its guilt—is an action arising from\r\nmistaken virtue, and therefore cannot be classed as a disgrace, though\r\nit be doubtless highly criminal. Where the guilty are so numerous,\r\nclemency must be extended to far the greater number; and I have little\r\ndoubt of procuring a remission for you, providing we can keep you out\r\nof the claws of justice till she has selected and gorged upon her\r\nvictims; for in this, as in other cases, it will be according to the\r\nvulgar proverb, “First come, first served.” Besides, government are\r\ndesirous at present to intimidate the English Jacobites, among whom\r\nthey can find few examples for punishment. This is a vindictive and\r\ntimid feeling which will soon wear off, for of all nations the English\r\nare least blood-thirsty by nature. But it exists at present, and you\r\nmust therefore be kept out of the way in the mean-time.”\r\n\r\nNow entered Spontoon with an anxious countenance. By his regimental\r\nacquaintances he had traced out Madam Nosebag, and found her full of\r\nire, fuss, and fidget at discovery of an impostor who had travelled\r\nfrom the north with her under the assumed name of Captain Butler of\r\nGardiner’s dragoons. She was going to lodge an information on the\r\nsubject, to have him sought for as an emissary of the Pretender; but\r\nSpontoon (an old soldier), while he pretended to approve, contrived to\r\nmake her delay her intention. No time, however, was to be lost: the\r\naccuracy of this good dame’s description might probably lead to the\r\ndiscovery that Waverley was the pretended Captain Butler, an\r\nidentification fraught with danger to Edward, perhaps to his uncle, and\r\neven to Colonel Talbot. Which way to direct his course was now,\r\ntherefore, the question.\r\n\r\n“To Scotland,” said Waverley.\r\n\r\n“To Scotland?” said the Colonel; “with what purpose? Not to engage\r\nagain with the rebels, I hope?”\r\n\r\n“No; I considered my campaign ended when, after all my efforts, I could\r\nnot rejoin them; and now, by all accounts, they are gone to make a\r\nwinter campaign in the Highlands, where such adherents as I am would\r\nrather be burdensome than useful. Indeed, it seems likely that they\r\nonly prolong the war to place the Chevalier’s person out of danger, and\r\nthen to make some terms for themselves. To burden them with my presence\r\nwould merely add another party, whom they would not give up and could\r\nnot defend. I understand they left almost all their English adherents\r\nin garrison at Carlisle, for that very reason. And on a more general\r\nview, Colonel, to confess the truth, though it may lower me in your\r\nopinion, I am heartly tired of the trade of war, and am, as Fletcher’s\r\nHumorous Lieutenant says, ‘even as weary of this fighting—’”\r\n\r\n“Fighting! pooh, what have you seen but a skirmish or two? Ah! if you\r\nsaw war on the grand scale—sixty or a hundred thousand men in the field\r\non each side!”\r\n\r\n“I am not at all curious, Colonel. “Enough,” says our homely proverb,\r\n“is as good as a feast.” The plumed troops and the big war used to\r\nenchant me in poetry, but the night marches, vigils, couches under the\r\nwintry sky, and such accompaniments of the glorious trade, are not at\r\nall to my taste in practice; then for dry blows, I had _my_ fill of\r\nfighting at Clifton, where I escaped by a hair’s-breadth half a dozen\r\ntimes; and you, I should think—” He stopped.\r\n\r\n“Had enough of it at Preston? you mean to say,” answered the Colonel,\r\nlaughing; “but ’tis my vocation, Hal.”\r\n\r\n“It is not mine, though,” said Waverley; “and having honourably got rid\r\nof the sword, which I drew only as a volunteer, I am quite satisfied\r\nwith my military experience, and shall be in no hurry to take it up\r\nagain.”\r\n\r\n“I am very glad you are of that mind; but then what would you do in the\r\nnorth?”\r\n\r\n“In the first place, there are some seaports on the eastern coast of\r\nScotland still in the hands of the Chevalier’s friends; should I gain\r\nany of them, I can easily embark for the Continent.”\r\n\r\n“Good, your second reason?”\r\n\r\n“Why, to speak the very truth, there is a person in Scotland upon whom\r\nI now find my happiness depends more than I was always aware, and about\r\nwhose situation I am very anxious.”\r\n\r\n“Then Emily was right, and there is a love affair in the case after\r\nall? And which of these two pretty Scotchwomen, whom you insisted upon\r\nmy admiring, is the distinguished fair? Not Miss Glen— I hope.”\r\n\r\n“No.”\r\n\r\n“Ah, pass for the other; simplicity may be improved, but pride and\r\nconceit never. Well, I don’t discourage you; I think it will please Sir\r\nEverard, from what he said when I jested with him about it; only I hope\r\nthat intolerable papa, with his brogue, and his snuff, and his Latin,\r\nand his insufferable long stories about the Duke of Berwick, will find\r\nit necessary hereafter to be an inhabitant of foreign parts. But as to\r\nthe daughter, though I think you might find as fitting a match in\r\nEngland, yet if your heart be really set upon this Scotch rosebud, why\r\nthe Baronet has a great opinion of her father and of his family, and he\r\nwishes much to see you married and settled, both for your own sake and\r\nfor that of the three ermines passant, which may otherwise pass away\r\naltogether. But I will bring you his mind fully upon the subject, since\r\nyou are debarred correspondence for the present, for I think you will\r\nnot be long in Scotland before me.”\r\n\r\n“Indeed! and what can induce you to think of returning to Scotland? No\r\nrelenting longings towards the land of mountains and floods, I am\r\nafraid.”\r\n\r\n“None, on my word; but Emily’s health is now, thank God,\r\nre-established, and, to tell you the truth, I have little hopes of\r\nconcluding the business which I have at present most at heart until I\r\ncan have a personal interview with his Royal Highness the\r\nCommander-in-Chief; for, as Fluellen says, “the duke doth love me well,\r\nand I thank heaven I have deserved some love at his hands.” I am now\r\ngoing out for an hour or two to arrange matters for your departure;\r\nyour liberty extends to the next room, Lady Emily’s parlour, where you\r\nwill find her when you are disposed for music, reading, or\r\nconversation. We have taken measures to exclude all servants but\r\nSpontoon, who is as true as steel.”\r\n\r\nIn about two hours Colonel Talbot returned, and found his young friend\r\nconversing with his lady; she pleased with his manners and information,\r\nand he delighted at being restored, though but for a moment, to the\r\nsociety of his own rank, from which he had been for some time excluded.\r\n\r\n“And now,” said the Colonel, “hear my arrangements, for there is little\r\ntime to lose. This youngster, Edward Waverley, _alias_ Williams,\r\n_alias_ Captain Butler, must continue to pass by his fourth _alias_ of\r\nFrancis Stanley, my nephew; he shall set out to-morrow for the North,\r\nand the chariot shall take him the first two stages. Spontoon shall\r\nthen attend him; and they shall ride post as far as Huntingdon; and the\r\npresence of Spontoon, well known on the road as my servant, will check\r\nall disposition to inquiry. At Huntingdon you will meet the real Frank\r\nStanley. He is studying at Cambridge; but, a little while ago, doubtful\r\nif Emily’s health would permit me to go down to the North myself, I\r\nprocured him a passport from the secretary of state’s office to go in\r\nmy stead. As he went chiefly to look after you, his journey is now\r\nunnecessary. He knows your story; you will dine together at Huntingdon;\r\nand perhaps your wise heads may hit upon some plan for removing or\r\ndiminishing the danger of your farther progress north-ward. And now\r\n(taking out a morocco case), let me put you in funds for the campaign.”\r\n\r\n“I am ashamed, my dear Colonel—”\r\n\r\n“Nay,” said Colonel Talbot, “you should command my purse in any event;\r\nbut this money is your own. Your father, considering the chance of your\r\nbeing attainted, left me his trustee for your advantage. So that you\r\nare worth above £15,000, besides Brerewood Lodge—a very independent\r\nperson, I promise you. There are bills here for £200; any larger sum\r\nyou may have, or credit abroad, as soon as your motions require it.”\r\n\r\nThe first use which occurred to Waverley of his newly acquired wealth\r\nwas to write to honest Farmer Jopson, requesting his acceptance of a\r\nsilver tankard on the part of his friend Williams, who had not\r\nforgotten the night of the eighteenth December last. He begged him at\r\nthe same time carefully to preserve for him his Highland garb and\r\naccoutrements, particularly the arms, curious in themselves, and to\r\nwhich the friendship of the donors gave additional value. Lady Emily\r\nundertook to find some suitable token of remembrance likely to flatter\r\nthe vanity and please the taste of Mrs. Williams; and the Colonel, who\r\nwas a kind of farmer, promised to send the Ullswater patriarch an\r\nexcellent team of horses for cart and plough.\r\n\r\nOne happy day Waverley spent in London; and, travelling in the manner\r\nprojected, he met with Frank Stanley at Huntingdon. The two young men\r\nwere acquainted in a minute.\r\n\r\n“I can read my uncle’s riddle,” said Stanley; “the cautious old soldier\r\ndid not care to hint to me that I might hand over to you this passport,\r\nwhich I have no occasion for; but if it should afterwards come out as\r\nthe rattle-pated trick of a young Cantab, _cela ne tire à rien_. You\r\nare therefore to be Francis Stanley, with this passport.” This proposal\r\nappeared in effect to alleviate a great part of the difficulties which\r\nEdward must otherwise have encountered at every turn; and accordingly\r\nhe scrupled not to avail himself of it, the more especially as he had\r\ndiscarded all political purposes from his present journey, and could\r\nnot be accused of furthering machinations against the government while\r\ntravelling under protection of the secretary’s passport.\r\n\r\nThe day passed merrily away. The young student was inquisitive about\r\nWaverley’s campaigns, and the manners of the Highlands, and Edward was\r\nobliged to satisfy his curiosity by whistling a pibroch, dancing a\r\nstrathspey, and singing a Highland song. The next morning Stanley rode\r\na stage northward with his new friend, and parted from him with great\r\nreluctance, upon the remonstrances of Spontoon, who, accustomed to\r\nsubmit to discipline, was rigid in enforcing it.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXXIV.\r\nDESOLATION\r\n\r\n\r\nWaverley riding post, as was the usual fashion of the period, without\r\nany adventure save one or two queries, which the talisman of his\r\npassport sufficiently answered, reached the borders of Scotland. Here\r\nhe heard the tidings of the decisive battle of Culloden. It was no more\r\nthan he had long expected, though the success at Falkirk had thrown a\r\nfaint and setting gleam over the arms of the Chevalier. Yet it came\r\nupon him like a shock, by which he was for a time altogether unmanned.\r\nThe generous, the courteous, the noble-minded adventurer was then a\r\nfugitive, with a price upon his head; his adherents, so brave, so\r\nenthusiastic, so faithful, were dead, imprisoned, or exiled. Where,\r\nnow, was the exalted and high-souled Fergus, if, indeed, he had\r\nsurvived the night at Clifton? Where the pure-hearted and primitive\r\nBaron of Bradwardine, whose foibles seemed foils to set off the\r\ndisinterestedness of his disposition, the genuine goodness of his\r\nheart, and his unshaken courage? Those who clung for support to these\r\nfallen columns, Rose and Flora, where were they to be sought, and in\r\nwhat distress must not the loss of their natural protectors have\r\ninvolved them? Of Flora he thought with the regard of a brother for a\r\nsister; of Rose with a sensation yet more deep and tender. It might be\r\nstill his fate to supply the want of those guardians they had lost.\r\nAgitated by these thoughts he precipitated his journey.\r\n\r\nWhen he arrived in Edinburgh, where his inquiries must necessarily\r\ncommence, he felt the full difficulty of his situation. Many\r\ninhabitants of that city had seen and known him as Edward Waverley;\r\nhow, then, could he avail himself of a passport as Francis Stanley? He\r\nresolved, therefore, to avoid all company, and to move northward as\r\nsoon as possible. He was, however, obliged to wait a day or two in\r\nexpectation of a letter from Colonel Talbot, and he was also to leave\r\nhis own address, under his feigned character, at a place agreed upon.\r\nWith this latter purpose he sallied out in the dusk through the\r\nwell-known streets, carefully shunning observation, but in vain: one of\r\nthe first persons whom he met at once recognised him. It was Mrs.\r\nFlockhart, Fergus Mac-Ivor’s good-humoured landlady.\r\n\r\n“Gude guide us, Mr. Waverley, is this you? na, ye needna be feared for\r\nme. I wad betray nae gentleman in your circumstances. Eh, lack-a-day!\r\nlack-a-day! here’s a change o’ markets; how merry Colonel Mac-Ivor and\r\nyou used to be in our house!” And the good-natured widow shed a few\r\nnatural tears. As there was no resisting her claim of acquaintance,\r\nWaverley acknowledged it with a good grace, as well as the danger of\r\nhis own situation. “As it’s near the darkening, sir, wad ye just step\r\nin by to our house and tak a dish o’ tea? and I am sure if ye like to\r\nsleep in the little room, I wad tak care ye are no disturbed, and\r\nnaebody wad ken ye; for Kate and Matty, the limmers, gaed aff wi’ twa\r\no’ Hawley’s dragoons, and I hae twa new queans instead o’ them.”\r\n\r\nWaverley accepted her invitation, and engaged her lodging for a night\r\nor two, satisfied he should be safer in the house of this simple\r\ncreature than anywhere else. When he entered the parlour his heart\r\nswelled to see Fergus’s bonnet, with the white cockade, hanging beside\r\nthe little mirror.\r\n\r\n“Ay,” said Mrs. Flockhart, sighing, as she observed the direction of\r\nhis eyes, “the puir Colonel bought a new ane just the day before they\r\nmarched, and I winna let them tak that ane doun, but just to brush it\r\nilka day mysell; and whiles I look at it till I just think I hear him\r\ncry to Callum to bring him his bonnet, as he used to do when he was\r\nganging out. It’s unco silly—the neighbours ca’ me a Jacobite, but they\r\nmay say their say—I am sure it’s no for that—but he was as kind-hearted\r\na gentleman as ever lived, and as weel-fa’rd too. Oh, d’ye ken, sir,\r\nwhen he is to suffer?”\r\n\r\n“Suffer! Good heaven! Why, where is he?”\r\n\r\n“Eh, Lord’s sake! d’ye no ken? The poor Hieland body, Dugald Mahony,\r\ncam here a while syne, wi’ ane o’ his arms cuttit off, and a sair clour\r\nin the head—ye’ll mind Dugald, he carried aye an axe on his\r\nshouther—and he cam here just begging, as I may say, for something to\r\neat. Aweel, he tauld us the Chief, as they ca’d him (but I aye ca’ him\r\nthe Colonel), and Ensign Maccombich, that ye mind weel, were ta’en\r\nsomewhere beside the English border, when it was sae dark that his folk\r\nnever missed him till it was ower late, and they were like to gang\r\nclean daft. And he said that little Callum Beg (he was a bauld\r\nmischievous callant that) and your honour were killed that same night\r\nin the tuilzie, and mony mae braw men. But he grat when he spak o’ the\r\nColonel, ye never saw the like. And now the word gangs the Colonel is\r\nto be tried, and to suffer wi’ them that were ta’en at Carlisle.”\r\n\r\n“And his sister?”\r\n\r\n“Ay, that they ca’d the Lady Flora—weel, she’s away up to Carlisle to\r\nhim, and lives wi’ some grand Papist lady thereabouts to be near him.”\r\n\r\n“And,” said Edward, “the other young lady?”\r\n\r\n“Whilk other? I ken only of ae sister the Colonel had.”\r\n\r\n“I mean Miss Bradwardine,” said Edward.\r\n\r\n“Ou, ay; the laird’s daughter” said his landlady. “She was a very bonny\r\nlassie, poor thing, but far shyer than Lady Flora.”\r\n\r\n“Where is she, for God’s sake?”\r\n\r\n“Ou, wha kens where ony o’ them is now? Puir things, they’re sair ta’en\r\ndoun for their white cockades and their white roses; but she gaed north\r\nto her father’s in Perthshire, when the government troops cam back to\r\nEdinbro’. There was some prettymen amang them, and ane Major Whacker\r\nwas quartered on me, a very ceevil gentleman,—but O, Mr. Waverley, he\r\nwas naething sae weel fa’rd as the puir Colonel.”\r\n\r\n“Do you know what is become of Miss Bradwardine’s father?”\r\n\r\n“The auld laird? Na, naebody kens that. But they say he fought very\r\nhard in that bluidy battle at Inverness; and Deacon Clank, the\r\nwhite-iron smith, says that the government folk are sair agane him for\r\nhaving been _out_ twice,—and troth he might hae ta’en warning, but\r\nthere’s nae fule like an auld fule. The puir Colonel was only out\r\nance.”\r\n\r\nSuch conversation contained almost all the good-natured widow knew of\r\nthe fate of her late lodgers and acquaintances; but it was enough to\r\ndetermine Edward, at all hazards, to proceed instantly to Tully-Veolan,\r\nwhere he concluded he should see, or at least hear, something of Rose.\r\nHe therefore left a letter for Colonel Talbot at the place agreed upon,\r\nsigned by his assumed name, and giving for his address the post-town\r\nnext to the Baron’s residence.\r\n\r\nFrom Edinburgh to Perth he took post-horses, resolving to make the rest\r\nof his journey on foot; a mode of travelling to which he was partial,\r\nand which had the advantage of permitting a deviation from the road\r\nwhen he saw parties of military at a distance. His campaign had\r\nconsiderably strengthened his constitution and improved his habits of\r\nenduring fatigue. His baggage he sent before him as opportunity\r\noccurred.\r\n\r\nAs he advanced northward, the traces of war became visible. Broken\r\ncarriages, dead horses, unroofed cottages, trees felled for palisades,\r\nand bridges destroyed or only partially repaired—all indicated the\r\nmovements of hostile armies. In those places where the gentry were\r\nattached to the Stuart cause, their houses seemed dismantled or\r\ndeserted, the usual course of what may be called ornamental labour was\r\ntotally interrupted, and the inhabitants were seen gliding about, with\r\nfear, sorrow, and dejection on their faces.\r\n\r\nIt was evening when he approached the village of Tully-Veolan, with\r\nfeelings and sentiments—how different from those which attended his\r\nfirst entrance! Then, life was so new to him that a dull or\r\ndisagreeable day was one of the greatest misfortunes which his\r\nimagination anticipated, and it seemed to him that his time ought only\r\nto be consecrated to elegant or amusing study, and relieved by social\r\nor youthful frolic. Now, how changed, how saddened, yet how elevated\r\nwas his character, within the course of a very few months! Danger and\r\nmisfortune are rapid, though severe teachers. “A sadder and a wiser\r\nman,” he felt in internal confidence and mental dignity a compensation\r\nfor the gay dreams which in his case experience had so rapidly\r\ndissolved.\r\n\r\nAs he approached the village he saw, with surprise and anxiety, that a\r\nparty of soldiers were quartered near it, and, what was worse, that\r\nthey seemed stationary there. This he conjectured from a few tents\r\nwhich he beheld glimmering upon what was called the Common Moor. To\r\navoid the risk of being stopped and questioned in a place where he was\r\nso likely to be recognised, he made a large circuit, altogether\r\navoiding the hamlet, and approaching the upper gate of the avenue by a\r\nby-path well known to him. A single glance announced that great changes\r\nhad taken place. One half of the gate, entirely destroyed and split up\r\nfor firewood, lay in piles, ready to be taken away; the other swung\r\nuselessly about upon its loosened hinges. The battlements above the\r\ngate were broken and thrown down, and the carved bears, which were said\r\nto have done sentinel’s duty upon the top for centuries, now, hurled\r\nfrom their posts, lay among the rubbish. The avenue was cruelly wasted.\r\nSeveral large trees were felled and left lying across the path; and the\r\ncattle of the villagers, and the more rude hoofs of dragoon horses, had\r\npoached into black mud the verdant turf which Waverley had so much\r\nadmired.\r\n\r\nUpon entering the court-yard, Edward saw the fears realised which these\r\ncircumstances had excited. The place had been sacked by the King’s\r\ntroops, who, in wanton mischief, had even attempted to burn it; and\r\nthough the thickness of the walls had resisted the fire, unless to a\r\npartial extent, the stables and out-houses were totally consumed. The\r\ntowers and pinnacles of the main building were scorched and blackened;\r\nthe pavement of the court broken and shattered, the doors torn down\r\nentirely, or hanging by a single hinge, the windows dashed in and\r\ndemolished, and the court strewed with articles of furniture broken\r\ninto fragments. The accessaries of ancient distinction, to which the\r\nBaron, in the pride of his heart, had attached so much importance and\r\nveneration, were treated with peculiar contumely. The fountain was\r\ndemolished, and the spring which had supplied it now flooded the\r\ncourt-yard. The stone basin seemed to be destined for a drinking-trough\r\nfor cattle, from the manner in which it was arranged upon the ground.\r\nThe whole tribe of bears, large and small, had experienced as little\r\nfavour as those at the head of the avenue, and one or two of the family\r\npictures, which seemed to have served as targets for the soldiers, lay\r\non the ground in tatters. With an aching heart, as may well be\r\nimagined, Edward viewed this wreck of a mansion so respected. But his\r\nanxiety to learn the fate of the proprietors, and his fears as to what\r\nthat fate might be, increased with every step. When he entered upon the\r\nterrace new scenes of desolation were visible. The balustrade was\r\nbroken down, the walls destroyed, the borders overgrown with weeds, and\r\nthe fruit-trees cut down or grubbed up. In one compartment of this\r\nold-fashioned garden were two immense horse-chestnut trees, of whose\r\nsize the Baron was particularly vain; too lazy, perhaps, to cut them\r\ndown, the spoilers, with malevolent ingenuity, had mined them and\r\nplaced a quantity of gunpowder in the cavity. One had been shivered to\r\npieces by the explosion, and the fragments lay scattered around,\r\nencumbering the ground it had so long shadowed. The other mine had been\r\nmore partial in its effect. About one-fourth of the trunk of the tree\r\nwas torn from the mass, which, mutilated and defaced on the one side,\r\nstill spread on the other its ample and undiminished boughs.[*]\r\n\r\n[* A pair of chestnut trees, destroyed, the one entirely and the other\r\nin part, by such a mischievous and wanton act of revenge, grew at\r\nInvergarry Castle, the fastness of MacDonald of Glengarry.]\r\n\r\n\r\nAmid these general marks of ravage, there were some which more\r\nparticularly addressed the feelings of Waverley. Viewing the front of\r\nthe building thus wasted and defaced, his eyes naturally sought the\r\nlittle balcony which more properly belonged to Rose’s apartment, her\r\n_troisième_, or rather _cinquième, étage_. It was easily discovered,\r\nfor beneath it lay the stage-flowers and shrubs with which it was her\r\npride to decorate it, and which had been hurled from the bartizan;\r\nseveral of her books were mingled with broken flower-pots and other\r\nremnants. Among these Waverley distinguished one of his own, a small\r\ncopy of Ariosto, and gathered it as a treasure, though wasted by the\r\nwind and rain.\r\n\r\nWhile, plunged in the sad reflections which the scene excited, he was\r\nlooking around for some one who might explain the fate of the\r\ninhabitants, he heard a voice from the interior of the building\r\nsinging, in well-remembered accents, an old Scottish song:—\r\n\r\nThey came upon us in the night,\r\nAnd brake my bower and slew my knight;\r\nMy servants a’ for life did flee,\r\nAnd left us in extremitie.\r\n\r\nThey slew my knight, to me sae dear;\r\nThey slew my knight, and drave his gear;[*]\r\nThe moon may set, the sun may rise,\r\nBut a deadly sleep has closed his eyes.\r\n\r\n\r\n[* The first three couplets are from an old ballad, called “The Border\r\nWidow’s Lament.”]\r\n\r\n\r\n“Alas,” thought Edward, “is it thou? Poor helpless being, art thou\r\nalone left, to gibber and moan, and fill with thy wild and unconnected\r\nscraps of minstrelsy the halls that protected thee?” He then called,\r\nfirst low, and then louder, “Davie—Davie Gellatley!”\r\n\r\nThe poor simpleton showed himself from among the ruins of a sort of\r\ngreenhouse, that once terminated what was called the terrace-walk, but\r\nat first sight of a stranger retreated, as if in terror. Waverley,\r\nremembering his habits, began to whistle a tune to which he was\r\npartial, which Davie had expressed great pleasure in listening to, and\r\nhad picked up from him by the ear. Our hero’s minstrelsy no more\r\nequalled that of Blondel than poor Davie resembled Cœur de Lion; but\r\nthe melody had the same effect of producing recognition. Davie again\r\nstole from his lurking-place, but timidly, while Waverley, afraid of\r\nfrightening him, stood making the most encouraging signals he could\r\ndevise. “It’s his ghaist,” muttered Davie; yet, coming nearer, he\r\nseemed to acknowledge his living acquaintance. The poor fool himself\r\nappeared the ghost of what he had been. The peculiar dress in which he\r\nhad been attired in better days showed only miserable rags of its\r\nwhimsical finery, the lack of which was oddly supplied by the remnants\r\nof tapestried hangings, window-curtains, and shreds of pictures with\r\nwhich he had bedizened his tatters. His face, too, had lost its vacant\r\nand careless air, and the poor creature looked hollow-eyed, meagre,\r\nhalf-starved, and nervous to a pitiable degree. After long hesitation,\r\nhe at length approached Waverley with some confidence, stared him sadly\r\nin the face, and said, “A’ dead and gane—a’ dead and gane.”\r\n\r\n“Who are dead?” said Waverley, forgetting the incapacity of Davie to\r\nhold any connected discourse.\r\n\r\n“Baron, and Bailie, and Saunders Saunderson, and Lady Rose that sang\r\nsae sweet—a’ dead and gane—dead and gane;\r\n\r\n“‘But follow, follow me,\r\nWhile glowworms light the lea,\r\nI’ll show ye where the dead should be—\r\n    Each in his shroud,\r\n    While winds pipe loud,\r\n    And the red moon peeps dim through the cloud.\r\nFollow, follow me;\r\nBrave should he be\r\nThat treads by night the dead man’s lea.’”\r\n\r\n\r\nWith these words, chanted in a wild and earnest tone, he made a sign to\r\nWaverley to follow him, and walked rapidly towards the bottom of the\r\ngarden, tracing the bank of the stream which, it may be remembered, was\r\nits eastern boundary. Edward, over whom an involuntary shuddering stole\r\nat the import of his words, followed him in some hope of an\r\nexplanation. As the house was evidently deserted, he could not expect\r\nto find among the ruins any more rational informer.\r\n\r\nDavie, walking very fast, soon reached the extremity of the garden, and\r\nscrambled over the ruins of the wall that once had divided it from the\r\nwooded glen in which the old tower of Tully-Veolan was situated. He\r\nthen jumped down into the bed of the stream, and, followed by Waverley,\r\nproceeded at a great pace, climbing over some fragments of rock and\r\nturning with difficulty round others. They passed beneath the ruins of\r\nthe castle; Waverley followed, keeping up with his guide with\r\ndifficulty, for the twilight began to fall. Following the descent of\r\nthe stream a little lower, he totally lost him, but a twinkling light\r\nwhich he now discovered among the tangled copse-wood and bushes seemed\r\na surer guide. He soon pursued a very uncouth path; and by its guidance\r\nat length reached the door of a wretched hut. A fierce barking of dogs\r\nwas at first heard, but it stilled at his approach. A voice sounded\r\nfrom within, and he held it most prudent to listen before he advanced.\r\n\r\n“Wha hast thou brought here, thou unsonsy villain, thou?” said an old\r\nwoman, apparently in great indignation. He heard Davie Gellatley in\r\nanswer whistle a part of the tune by which he had recalled himself to\r\nthe simpleton’s memory, and had now no hesitation to knock at the door.\r\nThere was a dead silence instantly within, except the deep growling of\r\nthe dogs; and he next heard the mistress of the hut approach the door,\r\nnot probably for the sake of undoing a latch, but of fastening a bolt.\r\nTo prevent this Waverley lifted the latch himself.\r\n\r\nIn front was an old wretched-looking woman, exclaiming, “Wha comes into\r\nfolk’s houses in this gate, at this time o’ the night?” On one side,\r\ntwo grim and half-starved deer greyhounds laid aside their ferocity at\r\nhis appearance, and seemed to recognise him. On the other side, half\r\nconcealed by the open door, yet apparently seeking that concealment\r\nreluctantly, with a cocked pistol in his right hand and his left in the\r\nact of drawing another from his belt, stood a tall bony gaunt figure in\r\nthe remnants of a faded uniform and a beard of three weeks’ growth. It\r\nwas the Baron of Bradwardine. It is unnecessary to add, that he threw\r\naside his weapon and greeted Waverley with a hearty embrace.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXXV.\r\nCOMPARING OF NOTES\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Baron’s story was short, when divested of the adages and\r\ncommonplaces, Latin, English, and Scotch, with which his erudition\r\ngarnished it. He insisted much upon his grief at the loss of Edward and\r\nof Glennaquoich, fought the fields of Falkirk and Culloden, and related\r\nhow, after all was lost in the last battle, he had returned home, under\r\nthe idea of more easily finding shelter among his own tenants and on\r\nhis own estate than elsewhere. A party of soldiers had been sent to lay\r\nwaste his property, for clemency was not the order of the day. Their\r\nproceedings, however, were checked by an order from the civil court.\r\nThe estate, it was found, might not be forfeited to the crown to the\r\nprejudice of Malcolm Bradwardine of Inch-Grabbit, the heir-male, whose\r\nclaim could not be prejudiced by the Baron’s attainder, as deriving no\r\nright through him, and who, therefore, like other heirs of entail in\r\nthe same situation, entered upon possession. But, unlike many in\r\nsimilar circumstances, the new laird speedily showed that he intended\r\nutterly to exclude his predecessor from all benefit or advantage in the\r\nestate, and that it was his purpose to avail himself of the old Baron’s\r\nevil fortune to the full extent. This was the more ungenerous, as it\r\nwas generally known that, from a romantic idea of not prejudicing this\r\nyoung man’s right as heir-male, the Baron had refrained from settling\r\nhis estate on his daughter.\r\n\r\nThis selfish injustice was resented by the country people, who were\r\npartial to their old master, and irritated against his successor. In\r\nthe Baron’s own words, “The matter did not coincide with the feelings\r\nof the commons of Bradwardine, Mr. Waverley; and the tenants were slack\r\nand repugnant in payment of their mails and duties; and when my kinsman\r\ncame to the village wi’ the new factor, Mr. James Howie, to lift the\r\nrents, some wanchancy person—I suspect John Heatherblutter, the auld\r\ngamekeeper, that was out wi’ me in the year Fifteen— fired a shot at him\r\nin the gloaming, whereby he was so affrighted, that I may say with\r\nTullius In Catilinam, “Abiit, evasit, erupit, effugit.” He fled, sir,\r\nas one may say, incontinent to Stirling. And now he hath advertised the\r\nestate for sale, being himself the last substitute in the entail. And\r\nif I were to lament about sic matters, this would grieve me mair than\r\nits passing from my immediate possession, whilk, by the course of\r\nnature, must have happened in a few years; whereas now it passes from\r\nthe lineage that should have possessed it in _sæcula sæculorum_. But\r\nGod’s will be done, _humana perpessi sumus_. Sir John of\r\nBradwardine—Black Sir John, as he is called—who was the common ancestor\r\nof our house and the Inch-Grabbits, little thought such a person would\r\nhave sprung from his loins. Mean time, he has accused me to some of the\r\n_primates_, the rulers for the time, as if I were a cut-throat, and an\r\nabettor of bravoes and assassinates and _coupe-jarrets_. And they have\r\nsent soldiers here to abide on the estate, and hunt me like a partridge\r\nupon the mountains, as Scripture says of good King David, or like our\r\nvaliant Sir William Wallace—not that I bring myself into comparison\r\nwith either. I thought, when I heard you at the door, they had driven\r\nthe auld deer to his den at last; and so I e’en proposed to die at bay,\r\nlike a buck of the first head. But now, Janet, canna ye gie us\r\nsomething for supper?”\r\n\r\n“Ou ay, sir, I’ll brander the moor-fowl that John Heatherblutter\r\nbrought in this morning; and ye see puir Davie’s roasting the black\r\nhen’s eggs. I daur say, Mr. Wauverley, ye never kend that a’ the eggs\r\nthat were sae weel roasted at supper in the Ha’-house were aye turned\r\nby our Davie? There’s no the like o’ him ony gate for powtering wi’ his\r\nfingers amang the het peat-ashes and roasting eggs.” Davie all this\r\nwhile lay with his nose almost in the fire, nuzzling among the ashes,\r\nkicking his heels, mumbling to himself, turning the eggs as they lay in\r\nthe hot embers, as if to confute the proverb, that “there goes reason\r\nto roasting of eggs,” and justify the eulogium which poor Janet poured\r\nout upon\r\n\r\nHim whom she loved, her idiot boy.\r\n\r\n\r\n“Davie’s no sae silly as folk tak him for, Mr. Wauverley; he wadna hae\r\nbrought you here unless he had kend ye was a friend to his Honour;\r\nindeed the very dogs kend ye, Mr. Wauverley, for ye was aye kind to\r\nbeast and body. I can tell you a story o’ Davie, wi’ his Honour’s\r\nleave. His Honour, ye see, being under hiding in thae sair times—the\r\nmair’s the pity—he lies a’ day, and whiles a’ night, in the cove in the\r\ndern hag; but though it’s a bieldy eneugh bit, and the auld gudeman o’\r\nCorse-Cleugh has panged it wi’ a kemple o’ strae amaist, yet when the\r\ncountry’s quiet, and the night very cauld, his Honour whiles creeps\r\ndoun here to get a warm at the ingle and a sleep amang the blankets,\r\nand gangs awa in the morning. And so, ae morning, siccan a fright as I\r\ngot! Twa unlucky red-coats were up for black-fishing, or some siccan\r\nploy—for the neb o’ them’s never out o’ mischief—and they just got a\r\nglisk o’ his Honour as he gaed into the wood, and banged aff a gun at\r\nhim. I out like a jer-falcon, and cried—‘Wad they shoot an honest\r\nwoman’s poor innocent bairn?’ And I fleyt at them, and threepit it was\r\nmy son; and they damned and swuir at me that it was the auld rebel, as\r\nthe villains ca’d his Honour; and Davie was in the wood, and heard the\r\ntuilzie, and he, just out o’ his ain head, got up the auld grey mantle\r\nthat his Honour had flung off him to gang the faster, and he cam out o’\r\nthe very same bit o’ the wood, majoring and looking about sae like his\r\nHonour, that they were clean beguiled, and thought they had letten aff\r\ntheir gun at crack-brained Sawney, as they ca’ him; and they gae me\r\nsaxpence, and twa saumon fish, to say naething about it. Na, na,\r\nDavie’s no just like other folk, puir fallow; but he’s no sae silly as\r\nfolk tak him for. But, to be sure, how can we do eneugh for his Honour,\r\nwhen we and ours have lived on his ground this twa hundred years; and\r\nwhen he keepit my puir Jamie at school and college, and even at the\r\nHa’-house, till he gaed to a better place; and when he saved me frae\r\nbeing ta’en to Perth as a witch—Lord forgi’e them that would touch sic\r\na puir silly auld body!—and has maintained puir Davie at heck and\r\nmanger maist feck o’ his life?”\r\n\r\nWaverley at length found an opportunity to interrupt Janet’s narrative\r\nby an inquiry after Miss Bradwardine.\r\n\r\n“She’s weel and safe, thank God! at the Duchran,” answered the Baron;\r\n“the laird’s distantly related to us, and more nearly to my chaplain,\r\nMr. Rubrick; and, though he be of Whig principles, yet he’s not\r\nforgetful of auld friendship at this time. The Bailie’s doing what he\r\ncan to save something out of the wreck for puir Rose; but I doubt, I\r\ndoubt, I shall never see her again, for I maun lay my banes in some far\r\ncountry.”\r\n\r\n“Hout na, your Honour,” said old Janet, “ye were just as ill aff in the\r\nfeifteen, and got the bonnie baronie back, an’ a’. And now the eggs is\r\nready, and the muir-cock’s brandered, and there’s ilk ane a trencher\r\nand some saut, and the heel o’ the white loaf that cam frae the\r\nBailie’s, and there’s plenty o’ brandy in the greybeard that Luckie\r\nMaclearie sent doun, and winna ye be suppered like princes?”\r\n\r\n“I wish one Prince, at least, of our acquaintance may be no worse off,”\r\nsaid the Baron to Waverley, who joined him in cordial hopes for the\r\nsafety of the unfortunate Chevalier.\r\n\r\nThey then began to talk of their future prospects. The Baron’s plan was\r\nvery simple. It was, to escape to France, where, by the interest of his\r\nold friends, he hoped to get some military employment, of which he\r\nstill conceived himself capable. He invited Waverley to go with him, a\r\nproposal in which he acquiesced, providing the interest of Colonel\r\nTalbot should fail in procuring his pardon. Tacitly he hoped the Baron\r\nwould sanction his addresses to Rose, and give him a right to assist\r\nhim in his exile; but he forbore to speak on this subject until his own\r\nfate should be decided. They then talked of Glennaquoich, for whom the\r\nBaron expressed great anxiety, although, he observed, he was “the very\r\nAchilles of Horatius Flaccus,—\r\n\r\n“‘Impiger, iracundus, inexorabilis, acer.’\r\n\r\n\r\nWhich,” he continued, “has been thus rendered (vernacularly) by Struan\r\nRobertson:—\r\n\r\n“‘A fiery etter-cap, a fractious chiel,\r\nAs het as ginger, and as stieve as steel.’”\r\n\r\n\r\nFlora had a large and unqualified share of the good old man’s sympathy.\r\n\r\nIt was now wearing late. Old Janet got into some kind of kennel behind\r\nthe hallan; Davie had been long asleep and snoring between Ban and\r\nBuscar. These dogs had followed him to the hut after the mansion-house\r\nwas deserted, and there constantly resided; and their ferocity, with\r\nthe old woman’s reputation of being a witch, contributed a good deal to\r\nkeep visitors from the glen. With this view, Bailie Macwheeble provided\r\nJanet underhand with meal for their maintenance, and also with little\r\narticles of luxury for his patron’s use, in supplying which much\r\nprecaution was necessarily used. After some compliments, the Baron\r\noccupied his usual couch, and Waverley reclined in an easy chair of\r\ntattered velvet, which had once garnished the state bed-room of\r\nTully-Veolan (for the furniture of this mansion was now scattered\r\nthrough all the cottages in the vicinity), and went to sleep as\r\ncomfortably as if he had been in a bed of down.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXXVI.\r\nMORE EXPLANATION\r\n\r\n\r\nWith the first dawn of day, old Janet was scuttling about the house to\r\nwake the Baron, who usually slept sound and heavily.\r\n\r\n“I must go back,” he said to Waverley, “to my cove; will you walk down\r\nthe glen wi’ me?” They went out together, and followed a narrow and\r\nentangled foot-path, which the occasional passage of anglers or\r\nwood-cutters had traced by the side of the stream. On their way the\r\nBaron explained to Waverley that he would be under no danger in\r\nremaining a day or two at Tully-Veolan, and even in being seen walking\r\nabout, if he used the precaution of pretending that he was looking at\r\nthe estate as agent or surveyor for an English gentleman who designed\r\nto be purchaser. With this view he recommended to him to visit the\r\nBailie, who still lived at the factor’s house, called Little Veolan,\r\nabout a mile from the village, though he was to remove at next term.\r\nStanley’s passport would be an answer to the officer who commanded the\r\nmilitary; and as to any of the country people who might recognise\r\nWaverley, the Baron assured him he was in no danger of being betrayed\r\nby them.\r\n\r\n“I believe,” said the old man, “half the people of the barony know that\r\ntheir poor auld laird is somewhere hereabout; for I see they do not\r\nsuffer a single bairn to come here a bird-nesting; a practice whilk,\r\nwhen I was in full possession of my power as baron, I was unable\r\ntotally to inhibit. Nay, I often find bits of things in my way, that\r\nthe poor bodies, God help them! leave there, because they think they\r\nmay be useful to me. I hope they will get a wiser master, and as kind a\r\none as I was.”\r\n\r\nA natural sigh closed the sentence; but the quiet equanimity with which\r\nthe Baron endured his misfortunes had something in it venerable and\r\neven sublime. There was no fruitless repining, no turbid melancholy; he\r\nbore his lot, and the hardships which it involved, with a good-humored,\r\nthough serious composure, and used no violent language against the\r\nprevailing party.\r\n\r\n“I did what I thought my duty,” said the good old man, “and\r\nquestionless they are doing what they think theirs. It grieves me\r\nsometimes to look upon these blackened walls of the house of my\r\nancestors; but doubtless officers cannot always keep the soldier’s hand\r\nfrom depredation and spuilzie, and Gustavus Adolphus himself, as ye may\r\nread in Colonel Munro his “Expedition with the Worthy Scotch Regiment\r\ncalled Mackay’s Regiment” did often permit it. Indeed I have myself\r\nseen as sad sights as Tully-Veolan now is when I served with the\r\nMaréchal Duke of Berwick. To be sure we may say with Virgilius Maro,\r\n‘Fuimus Troes’—and there’s the end of an auld sang. But houses and\r\nfamilies and men have a’ stood lang eneugh when they have stood till\r\nthey fall with honour; and now I hae gotten a house that is not unlike\r\na _domus ultima_”—they were now standing below a steep rock. “We poor\r\nJacobites,” continued the Baron, looking up, “are now like the conies\r\nin Holy Scripture (which the great traveller Pococke calleth Jerboa), a\r\nfeeble people, that make our abode in the rocks. So, fare you well, my\r\ngood lad, till we meet at Janet’s in the even; for I must get into my\r\nPatmos, which is no easy matter for my auld stiff limbs.”\r\n\r\nWith that he began to ascend the rock, striding, with the help of his\r\nhands, from one precarious footstep to another, till he got about\r\nhalf-way up, where two or three bushes concealed the mouth of a hole,\r\nresembling an oven, into which the Baron insinuated, first his head and\r\nshoulders, and then, by slow gradation, the rest of his long body; his\r\nlegs and feet finally disappearing, coiled up like a huge snake\r\nentering his retreat, or a long pedigree introduced with care and\r\ndifficulty into the narrow pigeon-hole of an old cabinet. Waverley had\r\nthe curiosity to clamber up and look in upon him in his den, as the\r\nlurking-place might well be termed. Upon the whole, he looked not\r\nunlike that ingenious puzzle called “a reel in a bottle,” the marvel of\r\nchildren (and of some grown people too, myself for one), who can\r\nneither comprehend the mystery how it has got in or how it is to be\r\ntaken out. The cave was very narrow, too low in the roof to admit of\r\nhis standing, or almost of his sitting up, though he made some awkward\r\nattempts at the latter posture. His sole amusement was the perusal of\r\nhis old friend Titus Livius, varied by occasionally scratching Latin\r\nproverbs and texts of Scripture with his knife on the roof and walls of\r\nhis fortalice, which were of sandstone. As the cave was dry, and filled\r\nwith clean straw and withered fern, “it made,” as he said, coiling\r\nhimself up with an air of snugness and comfort which contrasted\r\nstrangely with his situation, “unless when the wind was due north, a\r\nvery passable _gîte_ for an old soldier.” Neither, as he observed, was\r\nhe without sentries for the purpose of reconnoitring. Davie and his\r\nmother were constantly on the watch to discover and avert danger; and\r\nit was singular what instances of address seemed dictated by the\r\ninstinctive attachment of the poor simpleton when his patron’s safety\r\nwas concerned.\r\n\r\nWith Janet, Edward now sought an interview. He had recognised her at\r\nfirst sight as the old woman who had nursed him during his sickness\r\nafter his delivery from Gifted Gilfillan. The hut also, although a\r\nlittle repaired and somewhat better furnished, was certainly the place\r\nof his confinement; and he now recollected on the common moor of\r\nTully-Veolan the trunk of a large decayed tree, called the try\r\nsting-tree, which he had no doubt was the same at which the Highlanders\r\nrendezvoused on that memorable night. All this he had combined in his\r\nimagination the night before; but reasons which may probably occur to\r\nthe reader prevented him from catechising Janet in the presence of the\r\nBaron.\r\n\r\nHe now commenced the task in good earnest; and the first question was,\r\nWho was the young lady that visited the hut during his illness? Janet\r\npaused for a little; and then observed, that to keep the secret now\r\nwould neither do good nor ill to anybody.\r\n\r\n“It was just a leddy that hasna her equal in the world—Miss Rose\r\nBradwardine!”\r\n\r\n“Then Miss Rose was probably also the author of my deliverance,”\r\ninferred Waverley, delighted at the confirmation of an idea which local\r\ncircumstances had already induced him to entertain.\r\n\r\n“I wot weel, Mr. Wauverley, and that was she e’en; but sair, sair angry\r\nand affronted wad she hae been, puir thing, if she had thought ye had\r\nbeen ever to ken a word about the matter; for she gar’d me speak aye\r\nGaelic when ye was in hearing, to mak ye trow we were in the Hielands.\r\nI can speak it weil eneugh, for my mother was a Hieland woman.”\r\n\r\nA few more questions now brought out the whole mystery respecting\r\nWaverley’s deliverance from the bondage in which he left Cairnvreckan.\r\nNever did music sound sweeter to an amateur than the drowsy tautology\r\nwith which old Janet detailed every circumstance thrilled upon the ears\r\nof Waverley. But my reader is not a lover and I must spare his\r\npatience, by attempting to condense within reasonable compass the\r\nnarrative which old Janet spread through a harangue of nearly two\r\nhours.\r\n\r\nWhen Waverley communicated to Fergus the letter he had received from\r\nRose Bradwardine by Davie Gellatley, giving an account of Tully-Veolan\r\nbeing occupied by a small party of soldiers, that circumstance had\r\nstruck upon the busy and active mind of the Chieftain. Eager to\r\ndistress and narrow the posts of the enemy, desirous to prevent their\r\nestablishing a garrison so near him, and willing also to oblige the\r\nBaron—for he often had the idea of marriage with Rose floating through\r\nhis brain—he resolved to send some of his people to drive out the\r\nred-coats and to bring Rose to Glennaquoich. But just as he had ordered\r\nEvan with a small party on this duty, the news of Cope’s having marched\r\ninto the Highlands, to meet and disperse the forces of the Chevalier\r\nere they came to a head, obliged him to join the standard with his\r\nwhole forces.\r\n\r\nHe sent to order Donald Bean to attend him; but that cautious\r\nfreebooter, who well understood the value of a separate command,\r\ninstead of joining, sent various apologies which the pressure of the\r\ntimes compelled Fergus to admit as current, though not without the\r\ninternal resolution of being revenged on him for his procrastination,\r\ntime and place convenient. However, as he could not amend the matter,\r\nhe issued orders to Donald to descend into the Low Country, drive the\r\nsoldiers from Tully-Veolan, and, paying all respect to the mansion of\r\nthe Baron, to take his abode somewhere near it, for protection of his\r\ndaughter and family, and to harass and drive away any of the armed\r\nvolunteers or small parties of military which he might find moving\r\nabout the vicinity. As this charge formed a sort of roving commission,\r\nwhich Donald proposed to interpret in the way most advantageous to\r\nhimself, as he was relieved from the immediate terrors of Fergus, and\r\nas he had, from former secret services, some interest in the councils\r\nof the Chevalier, he resolved to make hay while the sun shone. He\r\nachieved without difficulty the task of driving the soldiers from\r\nTully-Veolan; but, although he did not venture to encroach upon the\r\ninterior of the family, or to disturb Miss Rose, being unwilling to\r\nmake himself a powerful enemy in the Chevalier’s army,\r\n\r\nFor well he knew the Baron’s wrath was deadly;\r\n\r\n\r\nyet he set about to raise contributions and exactions upon the\r\ntenantry, and otherwise to turn the war to his own advantage. Meanwhile\r\nhe mounted the white cockade, and waited upon Rose with a pretext of\r\ngreat devotion for the service in which her father was engaged, and\r\nmany apologies for the freedom he must necessarily use for the support\r\nof his people. It was at this moment that Rose learned, by open-mouthed\r\nfame, with all sorts of exaggeration, that Waverley had killed the\r\nsmith at Cairnvreckan, in an attempt to arrest him; had been cast into\r\na dungeon by Major Melville of Cairnvreckan, and was to be executed by\r\nmartial law within three days. In the agony which these tidings excited\r\nshe proposed to Donald Bean the rescue of the prisoner. It was the very\r\nsort of service which he was desirous to undertake, judging it might\r\nconstitute a merit of such a nature as would make amends for any\r\npeccadilloes which he might be guilty of in the country. He had the\r\nart, however, pleading all the while duty and discipline, to hold off,\r\nuntil poor Rose, in the extremity of her distress, offered to bribe him\r\nto the enterprise with some valuable jewels which had been her\r\nmother’s.\r\n\r\nDonald Bean, who had served in France, knew, and perhaps\r\nover-estimated, the value of these trinkets. But he also perceived\r\nRose’s apprehensions of its being discovered that she had parted with\r\nher jewels for Waverley’s liberation. Resolved this scruple should not\r\npart him and the treasure, he voluntarily offered to take an oath that\r\nhe would never mention Miss Rose’s share in the transaction; and,\r\nforeseeing convenience in keeping the oath and no probable advantage in\r\nbreaking it, he took the engagement—in order, as he told his\r\nlieutenant, to deal handsomely by the young lady—in the only mode and\r\nform which, by a mental paction with himself, he considered as binding:\r\nhe swore secrecy upon his drawn dirk. He was the more especially moved\r\nto this act of good faith by some attentions that Miss Bradwardine\r\nshowed to his daughter Alice, which, while they gained the heart of the\r\nmountain damsel, highly gratified the pride of her father. Alice, who\r\ncould now speak a little English, was very communicative in return for\r\nRose’s kindness, readily confided to her the whole papers respecting\r\nthe intrigue with Gardiner’s regiment, of which she was the depositary,\r\nand as readily undertook, at her instance, to restore them to Waverley\r\nwithout her father’s knowledge. For “they may oblige the bonnie young\r\nlady and the handsome young gentleman,” said Alice, “and what use has\r\nmy father for a whin bits o’ scarted paper?”\r\n\r\nThe reader is aware that she took an opportunity of executing this\r\npurpose on the eve of Waverley’s leaving the glen.\r\n\r\nHow Donald executed his enterprise the reader is aware. But the\r\nexpulsion of the military from Tully-Veolan had given alarm, and while\r\nhe was lying in wait for Gilfillan, a strong party, such as Donald did\r\nnot care to face, was sent to drive back the insurgents in their turn,\r\nto encamp there, and to protect the country. The officer, a gentleman\r\nand a disciplinarian, neither intruded himself on Miss Bradwardine,\r\nwhose unprotected situation he respected, nor permitted his soldiers to\r\ncommit any breach of discipline. He formed a little camp upon an\r\neminence near the house of Tully-Veolan, and placed proper guards at\r\nthe passes in the vicinity. This unwelcome news reached Donald Bean\r\nLean as he was returning to Tully-Veolan. Determined, however, to\r\nobtain the guerdon of his labour, he resolved, since approach to\r\nTully-Veolan was impossible, to deposit his prisoner in Janet’s\r\ncottage, a place the very existence of which could hardly have been\r\nsuspected even by those who had long lived in the vicinity, unless they\r\nhad been guided thither, and which was utterly unknown to Waverley\r\nhimself. This effected, he claimed and received his reward. Waverley’s\r\nillness was an event which deranged all their calculations. Donald was\r\nobliged to leave the neighbourhood with his people, and to seek more\r\nfree course for his adventures elsewhere. At Rose’s entreaty, he left\r\nan old man, a herbalist, who was supposed to understand a little of\r\nmedicine, to attend Waverley during his illness.\r\n\r\nIn the meanwhile, new and fearful doubts started in Rose’s mind. They\r\nwere suggested by old Janet, who insisted that, a reward having been\r\noffered for the apprehension of Waverley, and his own personal effects\r\nbeing so valuable, there was no saying to what breach of faith Donald\r\nmight be tempted. In an agony of grief and terror, Rose took the daring\r\nresolution of explaining to the Prince himself the danger in which Mr.\r\nWaverley stood, judging that, both as a politician and a man of honour\r\nand humanity, Charles Edward would interest himself to prevent his\r\nfalling into the hands of the opposite party. This letter she at first\r\nthought of sending anonymously, but naturally feared it would not in\r\nthat case be credited. She therefore subscribed her name, though with\r\nreluctance and terror, and consigned it in charge to a young man, who\r\nat leaving his farm to join the Chevalier’s army, made it his petition\r\nto her to have some sort of credentials to the adventurer, from whom he\r\nhoped to obtain a commission.\r\n\r\nThe letter reached Charles Edward on his descent to the Lowlands, and,\r\naware of the political importance of having it supposed that he was in\r\ncorrespondence with the English Jacobites, he caused the most positive\r\norders to be transmitted to Donald Bean Lean to transmit Waverley, safe\r\nand uninjured, in person or effects, to the governor of Doune Castle.\r\nThe freebooter durst not disobey, for the army of the Prince was now so\r\nnear him that punishment might have followed; besides, he was a\r\npolitician as well as a robber, and was unwilling to cancel the\r\ninterest created through former secret services by being refractory on\r\nthis occasion. He therefore made a virtue of necessity, and transmitted\r\norders to his lieutenant to convey Edward to Doune, which was safely\r\naccomplished in the mode mentioned in a former chapter. The governor of\r\nDoune was directed to send him to Edinburgh as a prisoner, because the\r\nPrince was apprehensive that Waverley, if set at liberty, might have\r\nresumed his purpose of returning to England, without affording him an\r\nopportunity of a personal interview. In this, indeed, he acted by the\r\nadvice of the Chieftain of Glennaquoich, with whom it may be remembered\r\nthe Chevalier communicated upon the mode of disposing of Edward, though\r\nwithout telling him how he came to learn the place of his confinement.\r\n\r\nThis, indeed, Charles Edward considered as a lady’s secret; for\r\nalthough Rose’s letter was couched in the most cautious and general\r\nterms, and professed to be written merely from motives of humanity and\r\nzeal for the Prince’s service, yet she expressed so anxious a wish that\r\nshe should not be known to have interfered, that the Chevalier was\r\ninduced to suspect the deep interest which she took in Waverley’s\r\nsafety. This conjecture, which was well founded, led, however, to false\r\ninferences. For the emotion which Edward displayed on approaching Flora\r\nand Rose at the ball of Holyrood was placed by the Chevalier to the\r\naccount of the latter; and he concluded that the Baron’s views about\r\nthe settlement of his property, or some such obstacle, thwarted their\r\nmutual inclinations. Common fame, it is true, frequently gave Waverley\r\nto Miss Mac-Ivor; but the Prince knew that common fame is very prodigal\r\nin such gifts; and, watching attentively the behaviour of the ladies\r\ntowards Waverley, he had no doubt that the young Englishman had no\r\ninterest with Flora, and was beloved by Rose Bradwardine. Desirous to\r\nbind Waverley to his service, and wishing also to do a kind and\r\nfriendly action, the Prince next assailed the Baron on the subject of\r\nsettling his estate upon his daughter. Mr. Bradwardine acquiesced; but\r\nthe consequence was that Fergus was immediately induced to prefer his\r\ndouble suit for a wife and an earldom, which the Prince rejected in the\r\nmanner we have seen. The Chevalier, constantly engaged in his own\r\nmultiplied affairs, had not hitherto sought any explanation with\r\nWaverley, though often meaning to do so. But after Fergus’s declaration\r\nhe saw the necessity of appearing neutral between the rivals, devoutly\r\nhoping that the matter, which now seemed fraught with the seeds of\r\nstrife, might be permitted to lie over till the termination of the\r\nexpedition. When, on the march to Derby, Fergus, being questioned\r\nconcerning his quarrel with Waverley, alleged as the cause that Edward\r\nwas desirous of retracting the suit he had made to his sister, the\r\nChevalier plainly told him that he had himself observed Miss Mac-Ivor’s\r\nbehaviour to Waverley, and that he was convinced Fergus was under the\r\ninfluence of a mistake in judging of Waverley’s conduct, who, he had\r\nevery reason to believe, was engaged to Miss Bradwardine. The quarrel\r\nwhich ensued between Edward and the Chieftain is, I hope, still in the\r\nremembrance of the reader. These circumstances will serve to explain\r\nsuch points of our narrative as, according to the custom of\r\nstory-tellers, we deemed it fit to leave unexplained, for the purpose\r\nof exciting the reader’s curiosity.\r\n\r\nWhen Janet had once finished the leading facts of this narrative,\r\nWaverley was easily enabled to apply the clue which they afforded to\r\nother mazes of the labyrinth in which he had been engaged. To Rose\r\nBradwardine, then, he owed the life which he now thought he could\r\nwillingly have laid down to serve her. A little reflection convinced\r\nhim, however, that to live for her sake was more convenient and\r\nagreeable, and that, being possessed of independence, she might share\r\nit with him either in foreign countries or in his own. The pleasure of\r\nbeing allied to a man of the Baron’s high worth, and who was so much\r\nvalued by his uncle Sir Everard, was also an agreeable consideration,\r\nhad anything been wanting to recommend the match. His absurdities,\r\nwhich had appeared grotesquely ludicrous during his prosperity, seemed,\r\nin the sunset of his fortune, to be harmonised and assimilated with the\r\nnoble features of his character, so as to add peculiarity without\r\nexciting ridicule. His mind occupied with such projects of future\r\nhappiness, Edward sought Little Veolan, the habitation of Mr. Duncan\r\nMacwheeble.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXXVII\r\n\r\n\r\nNow is Cupid a child of conscience—he makes restitution.\r\nSHAKSPEARE.\r\n\r\n\r\nMr. Duncan MacWheeble, no longer Commissary or Bailie, though still\r\nenjoying the empty name of the latter dignity, had escaped proscription\r\nby an early secession from the insurgent party and by his\r\ninsignificance.\r\n\r\nEdward found him in his office, immersed among papers and accounts.\r\nBefore him was a large bicker of oatmeal porridge, and at the side\r\nthereof a horn spoon and a bottle of two-penny. Eagerly running his eye\r\nover a voluminous law-paper, he from time to time shovelled an immense\r\nspoonful of these nutritive viands into his capacious mouth. A\r\npot-bellied Dutch bottle of brandy which stood by intimated either that\r\nthis honest limb of the law had taken his morning already, or that he\r\nmeant to season his porridge with such digestive; or perhaps both\r\ncircumstances might reasonably be inferred. His night-cap and\r\nmorning-gown, had whilome been of tartan, but, equally cautious and\r\nfrugal, the honest Bailie had got them dyed black, lest their original\r\nill-omened colour might remind his visitors of his unlucky excursion to\r\nDerby. To sum up the picture, his face was daubed with snuff up to the\r\neyes, and his fingers with ink up to the knuckles. He looked dubiously\r\nat Waverley as he approached the little green rail which fenced his\r\ndesk and stool from the approach of the vulgar. Nothing could give the\r\nBailie more annoyance than the idea of his acquaintance being claimed\r\nby any of the unfortunate gentlemen who were now so much more likely to\r\nneed assistance than to afford profit. But this was the rich young\r\nEnglishman; who knew what might be his situation? He was the Baron’s\r\nfriend too; what was to be done?\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nWhile these reflections gave an air of absurd perplexity to the poor\r\nman’s visage, Waverley, reflecting on the communication he was about to\r\nmake to him, of a nature so ridiculously contrasted with the appearance\r\nof the individual, could not help bursting out a-laughing, as he\r\nchecked the propensity to exclaim with Syphax—\r\n\r\nCato’s a proper person to intrust\r\nA love-tale with.\r\n\r\n\r\nAs Mr. Macwheeble had no idea of any person laughing heartily who was\r\neither encircled by peril or oppressed by poverty, the hilarity of\r\nEdward’s countenance greatly relieved the embarrassment of his own,\r\nand, giving him a tolerably hearty welcome to Little Veolan, he asked\r\nwhat he would choose for breakfast. His visitor had, in the first\r\nplace, something for his private ear, and begged leave to bolt the\r\ndoor. Duncan by no means liked this precaution, which savoured of\r\ndanger to be apprehended; but he could not now draw back.\r\n\r\nConvinced he might trust this man, as he could make it his interest to\r\nbe faithful, Edward communicated his present situation and future\r\nschemes to Macwheeble. The wily agent listened with apprehension when\r\nhe found Waverley was still in a state of proscription; was somewhat\r\ncomforted by learning that he had a passport; rubbed his hands with\r\nglee when he mentioned the amount of his present fortune; opened huge\r\neyes when he heard the brilliancy of his future expectations; but when\r\nhe expressed his intention to share them with Miss Rose Bradwardine,\r\necstasy had almost deprived the honest man of his senses. The Bailie\r\nstarted from his three-footed stool like the Pythoness from her tripod;\r\nflung his best wig out of the window, because the block on which it was\r\nplaced stood in the way of his career; chucked his cap to the ceiling,\r\ncaught it as it fell; whistled “Tullochgorum”; danced a Highland fling\r\nwith inimitable grace and agility, and then threw himself exhausted\r\ninto a chair, exclaiming, “Lady Wauverley! ten thousand a year the\r\nleast penny! Lord preserve my poor understanding!”\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n“Amen with all my heart,” said Waverley; “but now, Mr. Macwheeble, let\r\nus proceed to business.” This word had somewhat a sedative effect, but\r\nthe Bailie’s head, as he expressed himself, was still “in the bees.” He\r\nmended his pen, however, marked half a dozen sheets of paper with an\r\nample marginal fold, whipped down Dallas of St. Martin’s “Styles” from\r\na shelf, where that venerable work roosted with Stair’s “Institutions,”\r\nDirleton’s “Doubts,” Balfour’s “Practiques,” and a parcel of old\r\naccount-books, opened the volume at the article Contract of Marriage,\r\nand prepared to make what he called a “sma’ minute to prevent parties\r\nfrae resiling.”\r\n\r\nWith some difficulty Waverley made him comprehend that he was going a\r\nlittle too fast. He explained to him that he should want his\r\nassistance, in the first place, to make his residence safe for the\r\ntime, by writing to the officer at Tully-Veolan that Mr. Stanley, an\r\nEnglish gentleman nearly related to Colonel Talbot, was upon a visit of\r\nbusiness at Mr. Macwheeble’s, and, knowing the state of the country,\r\nhad sent his passport for Captain Foster’s inspection. This produced a\r\npolite answer from the officer, with an invitation to Mr. Stanley to\r\ndine with him, which was declined (as may easily be supposed) under\r\npretence of business.\r\n\r\nWaverley’s next request was, that Mr. Macwheeble would despatch a man\r\nand horse to——, the post-town at which Colonel Talbot was to address\r\nhim, with directions to wait there until the post should bring a letter\r\nfor Mr. Stanley, and then to forward it to Little Veolan with all\r\nspeed. In a moment the Bailie was in search of his apprentice (or\r\nservitor, as he was called Sixty Years Since), Jock Scriever, and in\r\nnot much greater space of time Jock was on the back of the white pony.\r\n\r\n“Tak care ye guide him weel, sir, for he’s aye been short in the wind\r\nsince—ahem—Lord be gude to me! (in a low voice), I was gaun to come out\r\nwi’—since I rode whip and spur to fetch the Chevalier to redd Mr.\r\nWauverley and Vich Ian Vohr; and an uncanny coup I gat for my pains.\r\nLord forgie your honour! I might hae broken my neck; but troth it was\r\nin a venture, mae ways nor ane; but this maks amends for a’. Lady\r\nWauverley! ten thousand a year! Lord be gude unto me!”\r\n\r\n“But you forget, Mr. Macwheeble, we want the Baron’s consent—the\r\nlady’s—”\r\n\r\n“Never fear, I’se be caution for them; I’se gie you my personal\r\nwarrandice. Ten thousand a year! it dings Balmawhapple out and out—a\r\nyear’s rent’s worth a’ Balmawhapple, fee and life-rent! Lord make us\r\nthankful!”\r\n\r\nTo turn the current of his feelings, Edward inquired if he had heard\r\nanything lately of the Chieftain of Glennaquoich.\r\n\r\n“Not one word,” answered Macwheeble, “but that he was still in Carlisle\r\nCastle, and was soon to be panelled for his life. I dinna wish the\r\nyoung gentleman ill,” he said, “but I hope that they that hae got him\r\nwill keep him, and no let him back to this Hieland border to plague us\r\nwi’ black-mail and a’ manner o’ violent, wrongous, and masterfu’\r\noppression and spoliation, both by himself and others of his causing,\r\nsending, and hounding out; and he couldna tak care o’ the siller when\r\nhe had gotten it neither, but flung it a’ into yon idle quean’s lap at\r\nEdinburgh; but light come light gane. For my part, I never wish to see\r\na kilt in the country again, nor a red-coat, nor a gun, for that\r\nmatter, unless it were to shoot a paitrick; they’re a’ tarr’d wi’ ae\r\nstick. And when they have done ye wrang, even when ye hae gotten\r\ndecreet of spuilzie, oppression, and violent profits against them, what\r\nbetter are ye? They hae na a plack to pay ye; ye need never extract\r\nit.”\r\n\r\nWith such discourse, and the intervening topics of business, the time\r\npassed until dinner, Macwheeble meanwhile promising to devise some mode\r\nof introducing Edward at the Duchran, where Rose at present resided,\r\nwithout risk of danger or suspicion; which seemed no very easy task,\r\nsince the laird was a very zealous friend to government. The\r\npoultry-yard had been laid under requisition, and cockyleeky and Scotch\r\ncollops soon reeked in the Bailie’s little parlour. The landlord’s\r\ncork-screw was just introduced into the muzzle of a pint bottle of\r\nclaret (cribbed possibly from the cellars of Tully-Veolan), when the\r\nsight of the grey pony passing the window at full trot induced the\r\nBailie, but with due precaution, to place it aside for the moment.\r\nEnter Jock Scriever with a packet for Mr. Stanley; it is Colonel\r\nTalbot’s seal, and Edward’s ringers tremble as he undoes it. Two\r\nofficial papers, folded, signed, and sealed in all formality, drop out.\r\nThey were hastily picked up by the Bailie, who had a natural respect\r\nfor everything resembling a deed, and, glancing slily on their titles,\r\nhis eyes, or rather spectacles, are greeted with “Protection by his\r\nRoyal Highness to the person of Cosmo Comyne Bradwardine, Esq., of that\r\nilk, commonly called Baron of Bradwardine, forfeited for his accession\r\nto the late rebellion.” The other proves to be a protection of the same\r\ntenor in favour of Edward Waverley, Esq. Colonel Talbot’s letter was in\r\nthese words:—\r\n\r\nMY DEAR EDWARD,—I am just arrived here, and yet I have finished my\r\nbusiness; it has cost me some trouble though, as you shall hear. I\r\nwaited upon his Royal Highness immediately on my arrival, and found him\r\nin no very good humour for my purpose. Three or four Scotch gentlemen\r\nwere just leaving his levee. After he had expressed himself to me very\r\ncourteously; “Would you think it,” he said, “Talbot, here have been\r\nhalf a dozen of the most respectable gentlemen and best friends to\r\ngovernment north of the Forth, Major Melville of Cairnvreckan, Rubrick\r\nof Duchran, and others, who have fairly wrung from me, by their\r\ndownright importunity, a present protection and the promise of a future\r\npardon for that stubborn old rebel whom they call Baron of Bradwardine.\r\nThey allege that his high personal character, and the clemency which he\r\nshowed to such of our people as fell into the rebels’ hands, should\r\nweigh in his favour, especially as the loss of his estate is likely to\r\nbe a severe enough punishment. Rubrick has undertaken to keep him at\r\nhis own house till things are settled in the country; but it’s a little\r\nhard to be forced in a manner to pardon such a mortal enemy to the\r\nHouse of Brunswick.” This was no favourable moment for opening my\r\nbusiness; however, I said I was rejoiced to learn that his Royal\r\nHighness was in the course of granting such requests, as it emboldened\r\nme to present one of the like nature in my own name. He was very angry,\r\nbut I persisted; I mentioned the uniform support of our three votes in,\r\nthe house, touched modestly on services abroad, though valuable only in\r\nhis Royal Highness’s having been pleased kindly to accept them, and\r\nfounded pretty strongly on his own expressions of friendship and\r\ngood-will. He was embarrassed, but obstinate. I hinted the policy of\r\ndetaching, on all future occasions, the heir of such a fortune as your\r\nuncle’s from the machinations of the disaffected. But I made no\r\nimpression. I mentioned the obligations which I lay under to Sir\r\nEverard and to you personally, and claimed, as the sole reward of my\r\nservices, that he would be pleased to afford me the means of evincing\r\nmy gratitude. I perceived that he still meditated a refusal, and,\r\ntaking my commission from my pocket, I said (as a last resource) that,\r\nas his Royal Highness did not, under these pressing circumstances,\r\nthink me worthy of a favour which he had not scrupled to grant to other\r\ngentlemen whose services I could hardly judge more important than my\r\nown, I must beg leave to deposit, with all humility, my commission in\r\nhis Royal Highness’s hands, and to retire from the service. He was not\r\nprepared for this; he told me to take up my commission, said some\r\nhandsome things of my services, and granted my request. You are\r\ntherefore once more a free man, and I have promised for you that you\r\nwill be a good boy in future, and remember what you owe to the lenity\r\nof government. Thus you see my prince can be as generous as yours. I do\r\nnot pretend, indeed, that he confers a favour with all the foreign\r\ngraces and compliments of your Chevalier errant; but he has a plain\r\nEnglish manner, and the evident reluctance with which he grants your\r\nrequest indicates the sacrifice which he makes of his own inclination\r\nto your wishes. My friend, the adjutant-general, has procured me a\r\nduplicate of the Baron’s protection (the original being in Major\r\nMelville’s possession), which I send to you, as I know that if you can\r\nfind him you will have pleasure in being the first to communicate the\r\njoyful intelligence. He will of course repair to the Duchran without\r\nloss of time, there to ride quarantine for a few weeks. As for you, I\r\ngive you leave to escort him thither, and to stay a week there, as I\r\nunderstand a certain fair lady is in that quarter. And I have the\r\npleasure to tell you that whatever progress you can make in her good\r\ngraces will be highly agreeable to Sir Everard and Mrs. Rachel, who\r\nwill never believe your views and prospects settled, and the three\r\nermines passant in actual safety, until you present them with a Mrs.\r\nEdward Waverley. Now, certain love-affairs of my own—a good many years\r\nsince—interrupted some measures which were then proposed in favour of\r\nthe three ermines passant; so I am bound in honour to make them amends.\r\nTherefore make good use of your time, for, when your week is expired,\r\nit will be necessary that you go to London to plead your pardon in the\r\nlaw courts.\r\n\r\n\r\n“Ever, dear Waverley, yours most truly,\r\n“PHILIP TALBOT.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXXVIII\r\n\r\n\r\nHappy’s the wooing\r\nThat’s not long a doing.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen the first rapturous sensation occasioned by these excellent\r\ntidings had somewhat subsided, Edward proposed instantly to go down to\r\nthe glen to acquaint the Baron with their import. But the cautious\r\nBailie justly observed that, if the Baron were to appear instantly in\r\npublic, the tenantry and villagers might become riotous in expressing\r\ntheir joy, and give offence to “the powers that be,” a sort of persons\r\nfor whom the Bailie always had unlimited respect. He therefore proposed\r\nthat Mr. Waverley should go to Janet Gellatley’s and bring the Baron up\r\nunder cloud of night to Little Veolan, where he might once more enjoy\r\nthe luxury of a good bed. In the meanwhile, he said, he himself would\r\ngo to Captain Foster and show him the Baron’s protection, and obtain\r\nhis countenance for harbouring him that night, and he would have horses\r\nready on the morrow to set him on his way to the Duchran along with Mr.\r\nStanley, “whilk denomination, I apprehend, your honour will for the\r\npresent retain,” said the Bailie.\r\n\r\n“Certainly, Mr. Macwheeble; but will you not go down to the glen\r\nyourself in the evening to meet your patron?”\r\n\r\n“That I wad wi’ a’ my heart; and mickle obliged to your honour for\r\nputting me in mind o’ my bounden duty. But it will be past sunset afore\r\nI get back frae the Captain’s, and at these unsonsy hours the glen has\r\na bad name; there’s something no that canny about auld Janet Gellatley.\r\nThe Laird he’ll no believe thae things, but he was aye ower rash and\r\nventuresome, and feared neither man nor deevil, an sae’s seen o’t. But\r\nright sure am I Sir George Mackenyie says, that no divine can doubt\r\nthere are witches, since the Bible says thou shalt not suffer them to\r\nlive; and that no lawyer in Scotland can doubt it, since it is\r\npunishable with death by our law. So there’s baith law and gospel for\r\nit. An his honour winna believe the Leviticus, he might aye believe the\r\nStatute-book; but he may tak his ain way o’t; it’s a’ ane to Duncan\r\nMacwheeble. However, I shall send to ask up auld Janet this e’en; it’s\r\nbest no to lightly them that have that character; and we’ll want Davie\r\nto turn the spit, for I’ll gar Eppie put down a fat goose to the fire\r\nfor your honours to your supper.”\r\n\r\nWhen it was near sunset Waverley hastened to the hut; and he could not\r\nbut allow that superstition had chosen no improper locality, or unfit\r\nobject, for the foundation of her fantastic terrors. It resembled\r\nexactly the description of Spenser:—\r\n\r\nThere, in a gloomy hollow glen, she found\r\nA little cottage built of sticks and reeds,\r\nIn homely wise, and wall’d with sods around,\r\nIn which a witch did dwell in loathly weeds,\r\nAnd wilful want, all careless of her needs,\r\nSo choosing solitary to abide\r\nFar from all neighbours, that her devilish deeds,\r\nAnd hellish arts, from people she might hide,\r\nAnd hurt far off, unknown, whomsoever she espied.\r\n\r\n\r\nHe entered the cottage with these verses in his memory. Poor old Janet,\r\nbent double with age and bleared with peat-smoke, was tottering about\r\nthe hut with a birch broom, muttering to herself as she endeavoured to\r\nmake her hearth and floor a little clean for the reception of her\r\nexpected guests. Waverley’s step made her start, look up, and fall\r\na-trembling, so much had her nerves been on the rack for her patron’s\r\nsafety. With difficulty Waverley made her comprehend that the Baron was\r\nnow safe from personal danger; and when her mind had admitted that\r\njoyful news, it was equally hard to make her believe that he was not to\r\nenter again upon possession of his estate. “It behoved to be,” she\r\nsaid, “he wad get it back again; naebody wad be sae gripple as to tak\r\nhis gear after they had gi’en him a pardon: and for that Inch-Grabbit,\r\nI could whiles wish mysell a witch for his sake, if I werena feared the\r\nEnemy wad tak me at my word.” Waverley then gave her some money, and\r\npromised that her fidelity should be rewarded. “How can I be rewarded,\r\nsir, sae weel as just to see my auld maister and Miss Rose come back\r\nand bruik their ain?”\r\n\r\nWaverley now took leave of Janet, and soon stood beneath the Baron’s\r\nPatmos. At a low whistle he observed the veteran peeping out to\r\nreconnoitre, like an old badger with his head out of his hole. “Ye hae\r\ncome rather early, my good lad,” said he, descending; “I question if\r\nthe red-coats hae beat the tattoo yet, and we’re not safe till then.”\r\n\r\n“Good news cannot be told too soon,” said Waverley; and with infinite\r\njoy communicated to him the happy tidings. The old man stood for a\r\nmoment in silent devotion, then exclaimed, “Praise be to God! I shall\r\nsee my bairn again.”\r\n\r\n“And never, I hope, to part with her more,” said Waverley.\r\n\r\n“I trust in God not, unless it be to win the means of supporting her;\r\nfor my things are but in a bruckle state;—but what signifies warld’s\r\ngear?”\r\n\r\n“And if,” said Waverley modestly, “there were a situation in life which\r\nwould put Miss Bradwardine beyond the uncertainty of fortune, and in\r\nthe rank to which she was born, would you object to it, my dear Baron,\r\nbecause it would make one of your friends the happiest man in the\r\nworld?” The Baron turned and looked at him with great earnestness.\r\n“Yes,” continued Edward, “I shall not consider my sentence of\r\nbanishment as repealed unless you will give me permission to accompany\r\nyou to the Duchran, and—”\r\n\r\nThe Baron seemed collecting all his dignity to make a suitable reply to\r\nwhat, at another time, he would have treated as the propounding a\r\ntreaty of alliance between the houses of Bradwardine and Waverley. But\r\nhis efforts were in vain; the father was too mighty for the Baron; the\r\npride of birth and rank were swept away; in the joyful surprise a\r\nslight convulsion passed rapidly over his features, as he gave way to\r\nthe feelings of nature, threw his arms around Waverley’s neck, and\r\nsobbed out—“My son, my son! if I had been to search the world, I would\r\nhave made my choice here.” Edward returned the embrace with great\r\nsympathy of feeling, and for a little while they both kept silence. At\r\nlength it was broken by Edward. “But Miss Bradwardine?”\r\n\r\n“She had never a will but her old father’s; besides, you are a likely\r\nyouth, of honest principles and high birth; no, she never had any other\r\nwill than mine, and in my proudest days I could not have wished a mair\r\neligible espousal for her than the nephew of my excellent old friend,\r\nSir Everard. But I hope, young man, ye deal na rashly in this matter? I\r\nhope ye hae secured the approbation of your ain friends and allies,\r\nparticularly of your uncle, who is _in loco parentis?_ Ah! we maun tak\r\nheed o’ that.” Edward assured him that Sir Everard would think himself\r\nhighly honoured in the flattering reception his proposal had met with,\r\nand that it had his entire approbation; in evidence of which he put\r\nColonel Talbot’s letter into the Baron’s hand. The Baron read it with\r\ngreat attention. “Sir Everard,” he said, “always despised wealth in\r\ncomparison of honour and birth; and indeed he hath no occasion to court\r\nthe _Diva Pecunia_. Yet I now wish, since this Malcolm turns out such a\r\nparricide, for I can call him no better, as to think of alienating the\r\nfamily inheritance—I now wish (his eyes fixed on a part of the roof\r\nwhich was visible above the trees) that I could have left Rose the auld\r\nhurley-house and the riggs belanging to it. And yet,” said he, resuming\r\nmore cheerfully, “it’s maybe as weel as it is; for, as Baron of\r\nBradwardine, I might have thought it my duty to insist upon certain\r\ncompliances respecting name and bearings, whilk now, as a landless\r\nlaird wi’ a tocherless daughter, no one can blame me for departing\r\nfrom.”\r\n\r\n“Now, Heaven be praised!” thought Edward, “that Sir Everard does not\r\nhear these scruples! The three ermines passant and rampant bear would\r\ncertainly have gone together by the ears.” He then, with all the ardour\r\nof a young lover, assured the Baron that he sought for his happiness\r\nonly in Rose’s heart and hand, and thought himself as happy in her\r\nfather’s simple approbation as if he had settled an earldom upon his\r\ndaughter.\r\n\r\nThey now reached Little Veolan. The goose was smoking on the table, and\r\nthe Bailie brandished his knife and fork. A joyous greeting took place\r\nbetween him and his patron. The kitchen, too, had its company. Auld\r\nJanet was established at the ingle-nook; Davie had turned the spit to\r\nhis immortal honour; and even Ban and Buscar, in the liberality of\r\nMacwheeble’s joy, had been stuffed to the throat with food, and now lay\r\nsnoring on the floor.\r\n\r\nThe next day conducted the Baron and his young friend to the Duchran,\r\nwhere the former was expected, in consequence of the success of the\r\nnearly unanimous application of the Scottish friends of government in\r\nhis favour. This had been so general and so powerful that it was almost\r\nthought his estate might have been saved, had it not passed into the\r\nrapacious hands of his unworthy kinsman, whose right, arising out of\r\nthe Baron’s attainder, could not be affected by a pardon from the\r\ncrown. The old gentleman, however, said, with his usual spirit, he was\r\nmore gratified by the hold he possessed in the good opinion of his\r\nneighbours than he would have been in being rehabilitated and restored\r\n_in integrum_, had it been found practicable.”\r\n\r\nWe shall not attempt to describe the meeting of the father and\r\ndaughter, loving each other so affectionately, and separated under such\r\nperilous circumstances. Still less shall we attempt to analyse the deep\r\nblush of Rose at receiving the compliments of Waverley, or stop to\r\ninquire whether she had any curiosity respecting the particular cause\r\nof his journey to Scotland at that period. We shall not even trouble\r\nthe reader with the humdrum details of a courtship Sixty Years Since.\r\nIt is enough to say that, under so strict a martinet as the Baron, all\r\nthings were conducted in due form. He took upon himself, the morning\r\nafter their arrival, the task of announcing the proposal of Waverley to\r\nRose, which she heard with a proper degree of maiden timidity. Fame\r\ndoes, however, say that Waverley had the evening before found five\r\nminutes to apprise her of what was coming, while the rest of the\r\ncompany were looking at three twisted serpents which formed a _jet\r\nd’eau_ in the garden.\r\n\r\nMy fair readers will judge for themselves; but, for my part, I cannot\r\nconceive how so important an affair could be communicated in so short a\r\nspace of time; at least, it certainly took a full hour in the Baron’s\r\nmode of conveying it.\r\n\r\nWaverley was now considered as a received lover in all the forms. He\r\nwas made, by dint of smirking and nodding on the part of the lady of\r\nthe house, to sit next Miss Bradwardine at dinner, to be Miss\r\nBradwardine’s partner at cards. If he came into the room, she of the\r\nfour Miss Rubricks who chanced to be next Rose was sure to recollect\r\nthat her thimble or her scissors were at the other end of the room, in\r\norder to leave the seat nearest to Miss Bradwardine vacant for his\r\noccupation. And sometimes, if papa and mamma were not in the way to\r\nkeep them on their good behaviour, the misses would titter a little.\r\nThe old Laird of Duchran would also have his occasional jest, and the\r\nold lady her remark. Even the Baron could not refrain; but here Rose\r\nescaped every embarrassment but that of conjecture, for his wit was\r\nusually couched in a Latin quotation. The very footmen sometimes\r\ngrinned too broadly, the maidservants giggled mayhap too loud, and a\r\nprovoking air of intelligence seemed to pervade the whole family. Alice\r\nBean, the pretty maid of the cavern, who, after her father’s\r\nmisfortune, as she called it, had attended Rose as _fille-de-chambre_,\r\nsmiled and smirked with the best of them. Rose and Edward, however,\r\nendured all these little vexatious circumstances as other folks have\r\ndone before and since, and probably contrived to obtain some\r\nindemnification, since they are not supposed, on the whole, to have\r\nbeen particularly unhappy during Waverley’s six days’ stay at the\r\nDuchran.\r\n\r\nIt was finally arranged that Edward should go to Waverley-Honour to\r\nmake the necessary arrangements for his marriage, thence to London to\r\ntake the proper measures for pleading his pardon, and return as soon as\r\npossible to claim the hand of his plighted bride. He also intended in\r\nhis journey to visit Colonel Talbot; but, above all, it was his most\r\nimportant object to learn the fate of the unfortunate Chief of\r\nGlennaquoich; to visit him at Carlisle, and to try whether anything\r\ncould be done for procuring, if not a pardon, a commutation at least,\r\nor alleviation, of the punishment to which he was almost certain of\r\nbeing condemned; and, in case of the worst, to offer the miserable\r\nFlora an asylum with Rose, or otherwise to assist her views in any mode\r\nwhich might seem possible. The fate of Fergus seemed hard to be\r\naverted. Edward had already striven to interest his friend, Colonel\r\nTalbot, in his behalf; but had been given distinctly to understand by\r\nhis reply that his credit in matters of that nature was totally\r\nexhausted.\r\n\r\nThe Colonel was still in Edinburgh, and proposed to wait there for some\r\nmonths upon business confided to him by the Duke of Cumberland. He was\r\nto be joined by Lady Emily, to whom easy travelling and goat’s whey\r\nwere recommended, and who was to journey northward under the escort of\r\nFrancis Stanley. Edward, therefore, met the Colonel at Edinburgh, who\r\nwished him joy in the kindest manner on his approaching happiness, and\r\ncheerfully undertook many commissions which our hero was necessarily\r\nobliged to delegate to his charge. But on the subject of Fergus he was\r\ninexorable. He satisfied Edward, indeed, that his interference would be\r\nunavailing; but, besides, Colonel Talbot owned that he could not\r\nconscientiously use any influence in favour of that unfortunate\r\ngentleman. “Justice,” he said, “which demanded some penalty of those\r\nwho had wrapped the whole nation in fear and in mourning, could not\r\nperhaps have selected a fitter victim. He came to the field with the\r\nfullest light upon the nature of his attempt. He had studied and\r\nunderstood the subject. His father’s fate could not intimidate him; the\r\nlenity of the laws which had restored to him his father’s property and\r\nrights could not melt him. That he was brave, generous, and possessed\r\nmany good qualities only rendered him the more dangerous; that he was\r\nenlightened and accomplished made his crime the less excusable; that he\r\nwas an enthusiast in a wrong cause only made him the more fit to be its\r\nmartyr. Above all, he had been the means of bringing many hundreds of\r\nmen into the field who, without him, would never have broken the peace\r\nof the country.\r\n\r\n“I repeat it,” said the Colonel, “though Heaven knows with a heart\r\ndistressed for him as an individual, that this young gentleman has\r\nstudied and fully understood the desperate game which he has played. He\r\nthrew for life or death, a coronet or a coffin; and he cannot now be\r\npermitted, with justice to the country, to draw stakes because the dice\r\nhave gone against him.”\r\n\r\nSuch was the reasoning of those times, held even by brave and humane\r\nmen towards a vanquished enemy. Let us devoutly hope that, in this\r\nrespect at least, we shall never see the scenes or hold the sentiments\r\nthat were general in Britain Sixty Years Since.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXXIX\r\n\r\n\r\nTomorrow? O that’s sudden!—Spare him, spare him!\r\nSHAKSPEARE.\r\n\r\n\r\nEdward, attended by his former servant Alick Polwarth, who had\r\nre-entered his service at Edinburgh, reached Carlisle while the\r\ncommission of Oyer and Terminer on his unfortunate associates was yet\r\nsitting. He had pushed forward in haste, not, alas! with the most\r\ndistant hope of saving Fergus, but to see him for the last time. I\r\nought to have mentioned that he had furnished funds for the defence of\r\nthe prisoners in the most liberal manner, as soon as he heard that the\r\nday of trial was fixed. A solicitor and the first counsel accordingly\r\nattended; but it was upon the same footing on which the first\r\nphysicians are usually summoned to the bedside of some dying man of\r\nrank—the doctors to take the advantage of some incalculable chance of\r\nan exertion of nature, the lawyers to avail themselves of the barely\r\npossible occurrence of some legal flaw. Edward pressed into the court,\r\nwhich was extremely crowded; but by his arriving from the north, and\r\nhis extreme eagerness and agitation, it was supposed he was a relation\r\nof the prisoners, and people made way for him. It was the third sitting\r\nof the court, and there were two men at the bar. The verdict of\r\n“Guilty” was already pronounced. Edward just glanced at the bar during\r\nthe momentous pause which ensued. There was no mistaking the stately\r\nform and noble features of Fergus Mac-Ivor, although his dress was\r\nsqualid and his countenance tinged with the sickly yellow hue of long\r\nand close imprisonment. By his side was Evan Maccombich. Edward felt\r\nsick and dizzy as he gazed on them; but he was recalled to himself as\r\nthe Clerk of Arraigns pronounced the solemn words: “Fergus Mac-Ivor of\r\nGlennaquoich, otherwise called Vich Ian Vohr, and Evan Mac-Ivor, in the\r\nDhu of Tarrascleugh, otherwise called Evan Dhu, otherwise called Evan\r\nMaccombich, or Evan Dhu MacCombich—you, and each of you, stand\r\nattainted of high treason. What have you to say for yourselves why the\r\nCourt should not pronounce judgment against you, that you die according\r\nto law?”\r\n\r\nFergus, as the presiding Judge was putting on the fatal cap of\r\njudgment, placed his own bonnet upon his head, regarded him with a\r\nsteadfast and stern look, and replied in a firm voice, “I cannot let\r\nthis numerous audience suppose that to such an appeal I have no answer\r\nto make. But what I have to say you would not bear to hear, for my\r\ndefence would be your condemnation. Proceed, then, in the name of God,\r\nto do what is permitted to you. Yesterday and the day before you have\r\ncondemned loyal and honourable blood to be poured forth like water.\r\nSpare not mine. Were that of all my ancestors in my veins, I would have\r\nperilled it in this quarrel.” He resumed his seat and refused again to\r\nrise.\r\n\r\nEvan Maccombich looked at him with great earnestness, and, rising up,\r\nseemed anxious to speak; but the confusion of the court, and the\r\nperplexity arising from thinking in a language different from that in\r\nwhich he was to express himself, kept him silent. There was a murmur of\r\ncompassion among the spectators, from the idea that the poor fellow\r\nintended to plead the influence of his superior as an excuse for his\r\ncrime. The Judge commanded silence, and encouraged Evan to proceed. “I\r\nwas only ganging to say, my lord,” said Evan, in what he meant to be an\r\ninsinuating manner, “that if your excellent honour and the honourable\r\nCourt would let Vich Ian Vohr go free just this once, and let him gae\r\nback to France, and no to trouble King George’s government again, that\r\nony six o’ the very best of his clan will be willing to be justified in\r\nhis stead; and if you’ll just let me gae down to Glennaquoich, I’ll\r\nfetch them up to ye mysell, to head or hang, and you may begin wi’ me\r\nthe very first man.”\r\n\r\nNotwithstanding the solemnity of the occasion, a sort of laugh was\r\nheard in the court at the extraordinary nature of the proposal. The\r\nJudge checked this indecency, and Evan, looking sternly around, when\r\nthe murmur abated, “If the Saxon gentlemen are laughing,” he said,\r\n“because a poor man, such as me, thinks my life, or the life of six of\r\nmy degree, is worth that of Vich Ian Vohr, it’s like enough they may be\r\nvery right; but if they laugh because they think I would not keep my\r\nword and come back to redeem him, I can tell them they ken neither the\r\nheart of a Hielandman nor the honour of a gentleman.”\r\n\r\nThere was no farther inclination to laugh among the audience, and a\r\ndead silence ensued.\r\n\r\nThe Judge then pronounced upon both prisoners the sentence of the law\r\nof high treason, with all its horrible accompaniments. The execution\r\nwas appointed for the ensuing day. “For you, Fergus Mac-Ivor,”\r\ncontinued the Judge, “I can hold out no hope of mercy. You must prepare\r\nagainst to-morrow for your last sufferings here, and your great audit\r\nhereafter.”\r\n\r\n“I desire nothing else, my lord,” answered Fergus, in the same manly\r\nand firm tone.\r\n\r\nThe hard eyes of Evan, which had been perpetually bent on his Chief,\r\nwere moistened with a tear. “For you, poor ignorant man,” continued the\r\nJudge, “who, following the ideas in which you have been educated, have\r\nthis day given us a striking example how the loyalty due to the king\r\nand state alone is, from your unhappy ideas of clanship, transferred to\r\nsome ambitious individual who ends by making you the tool of his\r\ncrimes—for you, I say, I feel so much compassion that, if you can make\r\nup your mind to petition for grace, I will endeavour to procure it for\r\nyou. Otherwise—”\r\n\r\n“Grace me no grace,” said Evan; “since you are to shed Vich Ian Vohr’s\r\nblood, the only favour I would accept from you is to bid them loose my\r\nhands and gie me my claymore, and bide you just a minute sitting where\r\nyou are!”\r\n\r\n“Remove the prisoners,” said the Judge; “his blood be upon his own\r\nhead.”\r\n\r\nAlmost stupefied with his feelings, Edward found that the rush of the\r\ncrowd had conveyed him out into the street ere he knew what he was\r\ndoing. His immediate wish was to see and speak with Fergus once more.\r\nHe applied at the Castle where his unfortunate friend was confined, but\r\nwas refused admittance. “The High Sheriff,” a non-commissioned officer\r\nsaid, “had requested of the governor that none should be admitted to\r\nsee the prisoner excepting his confessor and his sister.”\r\n\r\n“And where was Miss Mac-Ivor?” They gave him the direction. It was the\r\nhouse of a respectable Catholic family near Carlisle.\r\n\r\nRepulsed from the gate of the Castle, and not venturing to make\r\napplication to the High Sheriff or Judges in his own unpopular name, he\r\nhad recourse to the solicitor who came down in Fergus’s behalf. This\r\ngentleman told him that it was thought the public mind was in danger of\r\nbeing debauched by the account of the last moments of these persons, as\r\ngiven by the friends of the Pretender; that there had been a\r\nresolution, therefore, to exclude all such persons as had not the plea\r\nof near kindred for attending upon them. Yet he promised (to oblige the\r\nheir of Waverley-Honour) to get him an order for admittance to the\r\nprisoner the next morning, before his irons were knocked off for\r\nexecution.\r\n\r\n“Is it of Fergus Mac-Ivor they speak thus,” thought Waverley, “or do I\r\ndream? Of Fergus, the bold, the chivalrous, the free-minded, the lofty\r\nchieftain of a tribe devoted to him? Is it he, that I have seen lead\r\nthe chase and head the attack, the brave, the active, the young, the\r\nnoble, the love of ladies, and the theme of song,—is it he who is\r\nironed like a malefactor, who is to be dragged on a hurdle to the\r\ncommon gallows, to die a lingering and cruel death, and to be mangled\r\nby the hand of the most outcast of wretches? Evil indeed was the\r\nspectre that boded such a fate as this to the brave Chief of\r\nGlennaquoich!”\r\n\r\nWith a faltering voice he requested the solicitor to find means to warn\r\nFergus of his intended visit, should he obtain permission to make it.\r\nHe then turned away from him, and, returning to the inn, wrote a\r\nscarcely intelligible note to Flora Mac-Ivor, intimating his purpose to\r\nwait upon her that evening. The messenger brought back a letter in\r\nFlora’s beautiful Italian hand, which seemed scarce to tremble even\r\nunder this load of misery. “Miss Flora Mac-Ivor,” the letter bore,\r\n“could not refuse to see the dearest friend of her dear brother, even\r\nin her present circumstances of unparalleled distress.”\r\n\r\nWhen Edward reached Miss Mac-Ivor’s present place of abode he was\r\ninstantly admitted. In a large and gloomy tapestried apartment Flora\r\nwas seated by a latticed window, sewing what seemed to be a garment of\r\nwhite flannel. At a little distance sat an elderly woman, apparently a\r\nforeigner, and of a religious order. She was reading in a book of\r\nCatholic devotion, but when Waverley entered laid it on the table and\r\nleft the room. Flora rose to receive him, and stretched out her hand,\r\nbut neither ventured to attempt speech. Her fine complexion was totally\r\ngone; her person considerably emaciated; and her face and hands as\r\nwhite as the purest statuary marble, forming a strong contrast with her\r\nsable dress and jet-black hair. Yet, amid these marks of distress there\r\nwas nothing negligent or ill-arranged about her attire; even her hair,\r\nthough totally without ornament, was disposed with her usual attention\r\nto neatness. The first words she uttered were, “Have you seen him?”\r\n\r\n“Alas, no,” answered Waverley, “I have been refused admittance.”\r\n\r\n“It accords with the rest,” she said; “but we must submit. Shall you\r\nobtain leave, do you suppose?”\r\n\r\n“For—for—tomorrow,” said Waverley; but muttering the last word so\r\nfaintly that it was almost unintelligible.\r\n\r\n“Ay, then or never,” said Flora, “until”—she added, looking upward—“the\r\ntime when, I trust, we shall all meet. But I hope you will see him\r\nwhile earth yet bears him. He always loved you at his heart, though—but\r\nit is vain to talk of the past.”\r\n\r\n“Vain indeed!” echoed Waverley.\r\n\r\n“Or even of the future, my good friend,” said Flora, “so far as earthly\r\nevents are concerned; for how often have I pictured to myself the\r\nstrong possibility of this horrid issue, and tasked myself to consider\r\nhow I could support my part; and yet how far has all my anticipation\r\nfallen short of the unimaginable bitterness of this hour!”\r\n\r\n“Dear Flora, if your strength of mind—”\r\n\r\n“Ay, there it is,” she answered, somewhat wildly; “there is, Mr.\r\nWaverley, there is a busy devil at my heart that whispers—but it were\r\nmadness to listen to it—that the strength of mind on which Flora prided\r\nherself has murdered her brother!”\r\n\r\n“Good God! how can you give utterance to a thought so shocking?”\r\n\r\n“Ay, is it not so? But yet it haunts me like a phantom; I know it is\r\nunsubstantial and vain; but it _will_ be present; will intrude its\r\nhorrors on my mind; will whisper that my brother, as volatile as\r\nardent, would have divided his energies amid a hundred objects. It was\r\nI who taught him to concentrate them and to gage all on this dreadful\r\nand desperate cast. Oh that I could recollect that I had but once said\r\nto him, ‘He that striketh with the sword shall die by the sword’; that\r\nI had but once said, ‘Remain at home; reserve yourself, your vassals,\r\nyour life, for enterprises within the reach of man.’ But O, Mr.\r\nWaverley, I spurred his fiery temper, and half of his ruin at least\r\nlies with his sister!”\r\n\r\nThe horrid idea which she had intimated, Edward endeavoured to combat\r\nby every incoherent argument that occurred to him. He recalled to her\r\nthe principles on which both thought it their duty to act, and in which\r\nthey had been educated.\r\n\r\n“Do not think I have forgotten them,” she said, looking up with eager\r\nquickness; “I do not regret his attempt because it was wrong!—O no, on\r\nthat point I am armed—but because it was impossible it could end\r\notherwise than thus.”\r\n\r\n“Yet it did not always seem so desperate and hazardous as it was; and\r\nit would have been chosen by the bold spirit of Fergus whether you had\r\napproved it or no; your counsels only served to give unity and\r\nconsistence to his conduct; to dignify, but not to precipitate, his\r\nresolution.” Flora had soon ceased to listen to Edward, and was again\r\nintent upon her needlework.\r\n\r\n“Do you remember,” she said, looking up with a ghastly smile, “you once\r\nfound me making Fergus’s bride-favours, and now I am sewing his bridal\r\ngarment. Our friends here,” she continued, with suppressed emotion,\r\n“are to give hallowed earth in their chapel to the bloody relics of the\r\nlast Vich Ian Vohr. But they will not all rest together; no—his head!—I\r\nshall not have the last miserable consolation of kissing the cold lips\r\nof my dear, dear Fergus!”\r\n\r\nThe unfortunate Flora here, after one or two hysterical sobs, fainted\r\nin her chair. The lady, who had been attending in the ante-room, now\r\nentered hastily, and begged Edward to leave the room, but not the\r\nhouse.\r\n\r\nWhen he was recalled, after the space of nearly half an hour, he found\r\nthat, by a strong effort, Miss Mac-Ivor had greatly composed herself.\r\nIt was then he ventured to urge Miss Bradwardine’s claim to be\r\nconsidered as an adopted sister, and empowered to assist her plans for\r\nthe future.\r\n\r\n“I have had a letter from my dear Rose,” she replied, “to the same\r\npurpose. Sorrow is selfish and engrossing, or I would have written to\r\nexpress that, even in my own despair, I felt a gleam of pleasure at\r\nlearning her happy prospects, and at hearing that the good old Baron\r\nhas escaped the general wreck. Give this to my dearest Rose; it is her\r\npoor Flora’s only ornament of value, and was the gift of a princess.”\r\nShe put into his hands a case containing the chain of diamonds with\r\nwhich she used to decorate her hair. “To me it is in future useless.\r\nThe kindness of my friends has secured me a retreat in the convent of\r\nthe Scottish Benedictine nuns in Paris. Tomorrow—if indeed I can\r\nsurvive tomorrow—I set forward on my journey with this venerable\r\nsister. And now, Mr. Waverley, adieu! May you be as happy with Rose as\r\nyour amiable dispositions deserve; and think sometimes on the friends\r\nyou have lost. Do not attempt to see me again; it would be mistaken\r\nkindness.”\r\n\r\nShe gave him her hand, on which Edward shed a torrent of tears, and\r\nwith a faltering step withdrew from the apartment, and returned to the\r\ntown of Carlisle. At the inn he found a letter from his law friend\r\nintimating that he would be admitted to Fergus next morning as soon as\r\nthe Castle gates were opened, and permitted to remain with him till the\r\narrival of the Sheriff gave signal for the fatal procession.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XL\r\n\r\n\r\nA darker departure is near,\r\nThe death-drum is muffled, and sable the bier.\r\nCAMPBELL.\r\n\r\n\r\nAfter a sleepless night, the first dawn of morning found Waverley on\r\nthe esplanade in front of the old Gothic gate of Carlisle Castle. But\r\nhe paced it long in every direction before the hour when, according to\r\nthe rules of the garrison, the gates were opened and the draw-bridge\r\nlowered. He produced his order to the sergeant of the guard and was\r\nadmitted.\r\n\r\nThe place of Fergus’s confinement was a gloomy and vaulted apartment in\r\nthe central part of the Castle; a huge old tower, supposed to be of\r\ngreat antiquity, and surrounded by outworks, seemingly of Henry VIII.’s\r\ntime, or somewhat later. The grating of the large old-fashioned bars\r\nand bolts, withdrawn for the purpose of admitting Edward, was answered\r\nby the clash of chains, as the unfortunate Chieftain, strongly and\r\nheavily fettered, shuffled along the stone floor of his prison to fling\r\nhimself into his friend’s arms.\r\n\r\n“My dear Edward,” he said, in a firm and even cheerful voice, “this is\r\ntruly kind. I heard of your approaching happiness with the highest\r\npleasure. And how does Rose? and how is our old whimsical friend the\r\nBaron? Well, I trust, since I see you at freedom. And how will you\r\nsettle precedence between the three ermines passant and the bear and\r\nboot-jack?”\r\n\r\n“How, O how, my dear Fergus, can you talk of such things at such a\r\nmoment!”\r\n\r\n“Why, we have entered Carlisle with happier auspices, to be sure; on\r\nthe 16th of November last, for example, when we marched in side by\r\nside, and hoisted the white flag on these ancient towers. But I am no\r\nboy, to sit down and weep because the luck has gone against me. I knew\r\nthe stake which I risked; we played the game boldly and the forfeit\r\nshall be paid manfully. And now, since my time is short, let me come to\r\nthe questions that interest me most—the Prince, has he escaped the\r\nbloodhounds?”\r\n\r\n“He has, and is in safety.”\r\n\r\n“Praised be God for that! Tell me the particulars of his escape.”\r\n\r\nWaverley communicated that remarkable history, so far as it had then\r\ntranspired, to which Fergus listened with deep interest. He then asked\r\nafter several other friends; and made many minute inquiries concerning\r\nthe fate of his own clansmen. They had suffered less than other tribes\r\nwho had been engaged in the affair; for, having in a great measure\r\ndispersed and returned home after the captivity of their Chieftain,\r\naccording to the universal custom of the Highlanders, they were not in\r\narms when the insurrection was finally suppressed, and consequently\r\nwere treated with less rigour. This Fergus heard with great\r\nsatisfaction.\r\n\r\n“You are rich,” he said, “Waverley, and you are generous. When you hear\r\nof these poor Mac-Ivors being distressed about their miserable\r\npossessions by some harsh overseer or agent of government, remember you\r\nhave worn their tartan and are an adopted son of their race. The Baron,\r\nwho knows our manners and lives near our country, will apprise you of\r\nthe time and means to be their protector. Will you promise this to the\r\nlast Vich Ian Vohr?”\r\n\r\nEdward, as may well be believed, pledged his word; which he afterwards\r\nso amply redeemed that his memory still lives in these glens by the\r\nname of the Friend of the Sons of Ivor.\r\n\r\n“Would to God,” continued the Chieftain, “I could bequeath to you my\r\nrights to the love and obedience of this primitive and brave race; or\r\nat least, as I have striven to do, persuade poor Evan to accept of his\r\nlife upon their terms, and be to you what he has been to me, the\r\nkindest, the bravest, the most devoted—”\r\n\r\nThe tears which his own fate could not draw forth fell fast for that of\r\nhis foster-brother.\r\n\r\n“But,” said he, drying them, “that cannot be. You cannot be to them\r\nVich Ian Vohr; and these three magic words,” said he, half smiling,\r\n“are the only Open Sesame to their feelings and sympathies, and poor\r\nEvan must attend his foster-brother in death, as he has done through\r\nhis whole life.”\r\n\r\n“And I am sure,” said Maccombich, raising himself from the floor, on\r\nwhich, for fear of interrupting their conversation, he had lain so\r\nstill that, in the obscurity of the apartment, Edward was not aware of\r\nhis presence—“I am sure Evan never desired or deserved a better end\r\nthan just to die with his Chieftain.”\r\n\r\n“And now,” said Fergus, “while we are upon the subject of clanship—what\r\nthink you now of the prediction of the Bodach Glas?” Then, before\r\nEdward could answer, “I saw him again last night: he stood in the slip\r\nof moonshine which fell from that high and narrow window towards my\r\nbed. “Why should I fear him?” I thought; “to-morrow, long ere this\r\ntime, I shall be as immaterial as he.” “False spirit,” I said, “art\r\nthou come to close thy walks on earth and to enjoy thy triumph in the\r\nfall of the last descendant of thine enemy?” The spectre seemed to\r\nbeckon and to smile as he faded from my sight. What do you think of it?\r\nI asked the same question of the priest, who is a good and sensible\r\nman; he admitted that the church allowed that such apparitions were\r\npossible, but urged me not to permit my mind to dwell upon it, as\r\nimagination plays us such strange tricks. What do you think of it?”\r\n\r\n“Much as your confessor,” said Waverley, willing to avoid dispute upon\r\nsuch a point at such a moment. A tap at the door now announced that\r\ngood man, and Edward retired while he administered to both prisoners\r\nthe last rites of religion, in the mode which the Church of Rome\r\nprescribes.\r\n\r\nIn about an hour he was re-admitted; soon after, a file of soldiers\r\nentered with a blacksmith, who struck the fetters from the legs of the\r\nprisoners.\r\n\r\n“You see the compliment they pay to our Highland strength and courage;\r\nwe have lain chained here like wild beasts, till our legs are cramped\r\ninto palsy, and when they free us they send six soldiers with loaded\r\nmuskets to prevent our taking the castle by storm!”\r\n\r\nEdward afterwards learned that these severe precautions had been taken\r\nin consequence of a desperate attempt of the prisoners to escape, in\r\nwhich they had very nearly succeeded.\r\n\r\nShortly afterwards the drums of the garrison beat to arms. “This is the\r\nlast turn-out,” said Fergus, “that I shall hear and obey. And now, my\r\ndear, dear Edward, ere we part let us speak of Flora—a subject which\r\nawakes the tenderest feeling that yet thrills within me.”\r\n\r\n“We part not _here!_” said Waverley.\r\n\r\n“O yes, we do; you must come no farther. Not that I fear what is to\r\nfollow for myself,” he said proudly. “Nature has her tortures as well\r\nas art, and how happy should we think the man who escapes from the\r\nthroes of a mortal and painful disorder in the space of a short half\r\nhour? And this matter, spin it out as they will, cannot last longer.\r\nBut what a dying man can suffer firmly may kill a living friend to look\r\nupon. This same law of high treason,” he continued, with astonishing\r\nfirmness and composure, “is one of the blessings, Edward, with which\r\nyour free country has accommodated poor old Scotland; her own\r\njurisprudence, as I have heard, was much milder. But I suppose one day\r\nor other—when there are no longer any wild Highlanders to benefit by\r\nits tender mercies—they will blot it from their records as levelling\r\nthem with a nation of cannibals. The mummery, too, of exposing the\r\nsenseless head—they have not the wit to grace mine with a paper\r\ncoronet; there would be some satire in that, Edward. I hope they will\r\nset it on the Scotch gate though, that I may look, even after death, to\r\nthe blue hills of my own country, which I love so dearly. The Baron\r\nwould have added,\r\n\r\nMoritur, et moriens dulces reminiscitur Argos.”\r\n\r\n\r\nA bustle, and the sound of wheels and horses’ feet, was now heard in\r\nthe court-yard of the Castle. “As I have told you why you must not\r\nfollow me, and these sounds admonish me that my time flies fast, tell\r\nme how you found poor Flora.”\r\n\r\nWaverley, with a voice interrupted by suffocating sensations, gave some\r\naccount of the state of her mind.\r\n\r\n“Poor Flora!” answered the Chief, “she could have borne her own\r\nsentence of death, but not mine. You, Waverley, will soon know the\r\nhappiness of mutual affection in the married state—long, long may Rose\r\nand you enjoy it!—but you can never know the purity of feeling which\r\ncombines two orphans like Flora and me, left alone as it were in the\r\nworld, and being all in all to each other from our very infancy. But\r\nher strong sense of duty and predominant feeling of loyalty will give\r\nnew nerve to her mind after the immediate and acute sensation of this\r\nparting has passed away. She will then think of Fergus as of the heroes\r\nof our race, upon whose deeds she loved to dwell.”\r\n\r\n“Shall she not see you then?” asked Waverley. “She seemed to expect\r\nit.”\r\n\r\n“A necessary deceit will spare her the last dreadful parting. I could\r\nnot part with her without tears, and I cannot bear that these men\r\nshould think they have power to extort them. She was made to believe\r\nshe would see me at a later hour, and this letter, which my confessor\r\nwill deliver, will apprise her that all is over.”\r\n\r\nAn officer now appeared and intimated that the High Sheriff and his\r\nattendants waited before the gate of the Castle to claim the bodies of\r\nFergus Mac-Ivor and Evan Maccombich. “I come,” said Fergus.\r\nAccordingly, supporting Edward by the arm and followed by Evan Dhu and\r\nthe priest, he moved down the stairs of the tower, the soldiers\r\nbringing up the rear. The court was occupied by a squadron of dragoons\r\nand a battalion of infantry, drawn up in hollow square. Within their\r\nranks was the sledge or hurdle on which the prisoners were to be drawn\r\nto the place of execution, about a mile distant from Carlisle. It was\r\npainted black, and drawn by a white horse. At one end of the vehicle\r\nsat the executioner, a horrid-looking fellow, as beseemed his trade,\r\nwith the broad axe in his hand; at the other end, next the horse, was\r\nan empty seat for two persons. Through the deep and dark Gothic archway\r\nthat opened on the drawbridge were seen on horseback the High Sheriff\r\nand his attendants, whom the etiquette betwixt the civil and military\r\npowers did not permit to come farther. “This is well _got up_ for a\r\nclosing scene,” said Fergus, smiling disdainfully as he gazed around\r\nupon the apparatus of terror. Evan Dhu exclaimed with some eagerness,\r\nafter looking at the dragoons,” These are the very chields that\r\ngalloped off at Gladsmuir, before we could kill a dozen o’ them. They\r\nlook bold enough now, however.” The priest entreated him to be silent.\r\n\r\nThe sledge now approached, and Fergus, turning round, embraced\r\nWaverley, kissed him on each side of the face, and stepped nimbly into\r\nhis place. Evan sat down by his side. The priest was to follow in a\r\ncarriage belonging to his patron, the Catholic gentleman at whose house\r\nFlora resided. As Fergus waved his hand to Edward the ranks closed\r\naround the sledge, and the whole procession began to move forward.\r\nThere was a momentary stop at the gateway, while the governor of the\r\nCastle and the High Sheriff went through a short ceremony, the military\r\nofficer there delivering over the persons of the criminals to the civil\r\npower. “God save King George!” said the High Sheriff. When the\r\nformality concluded, Fergus stood erect in the sledge, and, with a firm\r\nand steady voice, replied,” God save King _James!_” These were the last\r\nwords which Waverley heard him speak.\r\n\r\nThe procession resumed its march, and the sledge vanished from beneath\r\nthe portal, under which it had stopped for an instant. The dead march\r\nwas then heard, and its melancholy sounds were mingled with those of a\r\nmuffled peal tolled from the neighbouring cathedral. The sound of\r\nmilitary music died away as the procession moved on; the sullen clang\r\nof the bells was soon heard to sound alone.\r\n\r\nThe last of the soldiers had now disappeared from under the vaulted\r\narchway through which they had been filing for several minutes; the\r\ncourt-yard was now totally empty, but Waverley still stood there as if\r\nstupefied, his eyes fixed upon the dark pass where he had so lately\r\nseen the last glimpse of his friend. At length a female servant of the\r\ngovernor’s, struck with compassion, at the stupefied misery which his\r\ncountenance expressed, asked him if he would not walk into her master’s\r\nhouse and sit down? She was obliged to repeat her question twice ere he\r\ncomprehended her, but at length it recalled him to himself. Declining\r\nthe courtesy by a hasty gesture, he pulled his hat over his eyes, and,\r\nleaving the Castle, walked as swiftly as he could through the empty\r\nstreets till he regained his inn, then rushed into an apartment and\r\nbolted the door.\r\n\r\nIn about an hour and a half, which seemed an age of unutterable\r\nsuspense, the sound of the drums and fifes performing a lively air, and\r\nthe confused murmur of the crowd which now filled the streets, so\r\nlately deserted, apprised him that all was finished, and that the\r\nmilitary and populace were returning from the dreadful scene. I will\r\nnot attempt to describe his sensations.\r\n\r\nIn the evening the priest made him a visit, and informed him that he\r\ndid so by directions of his deceased friend, to assure him that Fergus\r\nMac-Ivor had died as he lived, and remembered his friendship to the\r\nlast. He added, he had also seen Flora, whose state of mind seemed more\r\ncomposed since all was over. With her and sister Theresa the priest\r\nproposed next day to leave Carlisle for the nearest seaport from which\r\nthey could embark for France. Waverley forced on this good man a ring\r\nof some value and a sum of money to be employed (as he thought might\r\ngratify Flora) in the services of the Catholic church for the memory of\r\nhis friend. “Fungarque inani munere,” he repeated, as the ecclesiastic\r\nretired. “Yet why not class these acts of remembrance with other\r\nhonours, with which affection in all sects pursues the memory of the\r\ndead?”\r\n\r\nThe next morning ere daylight he took leave of the town of Carlisle,\r\npromising to himself never again to enter its walls. He dared hardly\r\nlook back towards the Gothic battlements of the fortified gate under\r\nwhich he passed, for the place is surrounded with an old wall. “They’re\r\nno there,” said Alick Polwarth, who guessed the cause of the dubious\r\nlook which Waverley cast backward, and who, with the vulgar appetite\r\nfor the horrible, was master of each detail of the butchery—“the heads\r\nare ower the Scotch yate, as they ca’ it. It’s a great pity of Evan\r\nDhu, who was a very weel-meaning, good-natured man, to be a Hielandman;\r\nand indeed so was the Laird o’ Glennaquoich too, for that matter, when\r\nhe wasna in ane o’ his tirrivies.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XLI.\r\nDULCE DOMUM\r\n\r\n\r\nThe impression of horror with which Waverley left Carlisle softened by\r\ndegrees into melancholy, a gradation which was accelerated by the\r\npainful yet soothing task of writing to Rose; and, while he could not\r\nsuppress his own feelings of the calamity, he endeavoured to place it\r\nin a light which might grieve her without shocking her imagination. The\r\npicture which he drew for her benefit he gradually familiarised to his\r\nown mind, and his next letters were more cheerful, and referred to the\r\nprospects of peace and happiness which lay before them. Yet, though his\r\nfirst horrible sensations had sunk into melancholy, Edward had reached\r\nhis native country before he could, as usual on former occasions, look\r\nround for enjoyment upon the face of nature.\r\n\r\nHe then, for the first time since leaving Edinburgh, began to\r\nexperience that pleasure which almost all feel who return to a verdant,\r\npopulous, and highly cultivated country from scenes of waste desolation\r\nor of solitary and melancholy grandeur. But how were those feelings\r\nenhanced when he entered on the domain so long possessed by his\r\nforefathers; recognised the old oaks of Waverley-Chace; thought with\r\nwhat delight he should introduce Rose to all his favourite haunts;\r\nbeheld at length the towers of the venerable hall arise above the woods\r\nwhich embowered it, and finally threw himself into the arms of the\r\nvenerable relations to whom he owed so much duty and affection!\r\n\r\nThe happiness of their meeting was not tarnished by a single word of\r\nreproach. On the contrary, whatever pain Sir Everard and Mrs. Rachel\r\nhad felt during Waverley’s perilous engagement with the young\r\nChevalier, it assorted too well with the principles in which they had\r\nbeen brought up to incur reprobation, or even censure. Colonel Talbot\r\nalso had smoothed the way with great address for Edward’s favourable\r\nreception by dwelling upon his gallant behaviour in the military\r\ncharacter, particularly his bravery and generosity at Preston; until,\r\nwarmed at the idea of their nephew’s engaging in single combat, making\r\nprisoner, and saving from slaughter so distinguished an officer as the\r\nColonel himself, the imagination of the Baronet and his sister ranked\r\nthe exploits of Edward with those of Wilibert, Hildebrand, and Nigel,\r\nthe vaunted heroes of their line.\r\n\r\nThe appearance of Waverley, embrowned by exercise and dignified by the\r\nhabits of military discipline, had acquired an athletic and hardy\r\ncharacter, which not only verified the Colonel’s narration, but\r\nsurprised and delighted all the inhabitants of Waverley-Honour. They\r\ncrowded to see, to hear him, and to sing his praises. Mr. Pembroke, who\r\nsecretly extolled his spirit and courage in embracing the genuine cause\r\nof the Church of England, censured his pupil gently, nevertheless, for\r\nbeing so careless of his manuscripts, which indeed, he said, had\r\noccasioned him some personal inconvenience, as, upon the Baronet’s\r\nbeing arrested by a king’s messenger, he had deemed it prudent to\r\nretire to a concealment called “The Priest’s Hole,” from the use it had\r\nbeen put to in former days; where, he assured our hero, the butler had\r\nthought it safe to venture with food only once in the day, so that he\r\nhad been repeatedly compelled to dine upon victuals either absolutely\r\ncold or, what was worse, only half warm, not to mention that sometimes\r\nhis bed had not been arranged for two days together. Waverley’s mind\r\ninvoluntarily turned to the Patmos of the Baron of Bradwardine, who was\r\nwell pleased with Janet’s fare and a few bunches of straw stowed in a\r\ncleft in the front of a sand-cliff; but he made no remarks upon a\r\ncontrast which could only mortify his worthy tutor.\r\n\r\nAll was now in a bustle to prepare for the nuptials of Edward, an event\r\nto which the good old Baronet and Mrs. Rachel looked forward as if to\r\nthe renewal of their own youth. The match, as Colonel Talbot had\r\nintimated, had seemed to them in the highest degree eligible, having\r\nevery recommendation but wealth, of which they themselves had more than\r\nenough. Mr. Clippurse was therefore summoned to Waverley-Honour, under\r\nbetter auspices than at the commencement of our story. But Mr.\r\nClippurse came not alone; for, being now stricken in years, he had\r\nassociated with him a nephew, a younger vulture (as our English\r\nJuvenal, who tells the tale of Swallow the attorney, might have called\r\nhim), and they now carried on business as Messrs. Clippurse and Hookem.\r\nThese worthy gentlemen had directions to make the necessary settlements\r\non the most splendid scale of liberality, as if Edward were to wed a\r\npeeress in her own right, with her paternal estate tacked to the fringe\r\nof her ermine.\r\n\r\nBut before entering upon a subject of proverbial delay, I must remind\r\nmy reader of the progress of a stone rolled downhill by an idle truant\r\nboy (a pastime at which I was myself expert in my more juvenile years),\r\nit moves at first slowly, avoiding by inflection every obstacle of the\r\nleast importance; but when it has attained its full impulse, and draws\r\nnear the conclusion of its career, it smokes and thunders down, taking\r\na rood at every spring, clearing hedge and ditch like a Yorkshire\r\nhuntsman, and becoming most furiously rapid in its course when it is\r\nnearest to being consigned to rest for ever. Even such is the course of\r\na narrative like that which you are perusing. The earlier events are\r\nstudiously dwelt upon, that you, kind reader, may be introduced to the\r\ncharacter rather by narrative than by the duller medium of direct\r\ndescription; but when the story draws near its close, we hurry over the\r\ncircumstances, however important, which your imagination must have\r\nforestalled, and leave you to suppose those things which it would be\r\nabusing your patience to relate at length.\r\n\r\nWe are, therefore, so far from attempting to trace the dull progress of\r\nMessrs. Clippurse and Hookem, or that of their worthy official brethren\r\nwho had the charge of suing out the pardons of Edward Waverley and his\r\nintended father-in-law, that we can but touch upon matters more\r\nattractive. The mutual epistles, for example, which were exchanged\r\nbetween Sir Everard and the Baron upon this occasion, though matchless\r\nspecimens of eloquence in their way, must be consigned to merciless\r\noblivion. Nor can I tell you at length how worthy Aunt Rachel, not\r\nwithout a delicate and affectionate allusion to the circumstances which\r\nhad transferred Rose’s maternal diamonds to the hands of Donald Bean\r\nLean, stocked her casket with a set of jewels that a duchess might have\r\nenvied. Moreover, the reader will have the goodness to imagine that Job\r\nHoughton and his dame were suitably provided for, although they could\r\nnever be persuaded that their son fell otherwise than fighting by the\r\nyoung squire’s side; so that Alick, who, as a lover of truth, had made\r\nmany needless attempts to expound the real circumstances to them, was\r\nfinally ordered to say not a word more upon the subject. He indemnified\r\nhimself, however, by the liberal allowance of desperate battles, grisly\r\nexecutions, and raw-head and bloody-bone stories with which he\r\nastonished the servants’ hall.\r\n\r\nBut although these important matters may be briefly told in narrative,\r\nlike a newspaper report of a Chancery suit, yet, with all the urgency\r\nwhich Waverley could use, the real time which the law proceedings\r\noccupied, joined to the delay occasioned by the mode of travelling at\r\nthat period, rendered it considerably more than two months ere\r\nWaverley, having left England, alighted once more at the mansion of the\r\nLaird of Duchran to claim the hand of his plighted bride.\r\n\r\nThe day of his marriage was fixed for the sixth after his arrival. The\r\nBaron of Bradwardine, with whom bridals, christenings, and funerals\r\nwere festivals of high and solemn import, felt a little hurt that,\r\nincluding the family of the Duchran and all the immediate vicinity who\r\nhad title to be present on such an occasion, there could not be above\r\nthirty persons collected. “When he was married,” he observed, “three\r\nhundred horse of gentlemen born, besides servants, and some score or\r\ntwo of Highland lairds, who never got on horseback, were present on the\r\noccasion.”\r\n\r\nBut his pride found some consolation in reflecting that, he and his\r\nson-in-law having been so lately in arms against government, it might\r\ngive matter of reasonable fear and offence to the ruling powers if they\r\nwere to collect together the kith, kin, and allies of their houses,\r\narrayed in effeir of war, as was the ancient custom of Scotland on\r\nthese occasions—“And, without dubitation,” he concluded with a sigh,\r\n“many of those who would have rejoiced most freely upon these joyful\r\nespousals are either gone to a better place or are now exiles from\r\ntheir native land.”\r\n\r\nThe marriage took place on the appointed day. The Reverend Mr. Rubrick,\r\nkinsman to the proprietor of the hospitable mansion where it was\r\nsolemnised, and chaplain to the Baron of Bradwardine, had the\r\nsatisfaction to unite their hands; and Frank Stanley acted as\r\nbridesman, having joined Edward with that view soon after his arrival.\r\nLady Emily and Colonel Talbot had proposed being present; but Lady\r\nEmily’s health, when the day approached, was found inadequate to the\r\njourney. In amends it was arranged that Edward Waverley and his lady,\r\nwho, with the Baron, proposed an immediate journey to Waverley-Honour,\r\nshould in their way spend a few days at an estate which Colonel Talbot\r\nhad been tempted to purchase in Scotland as a very great bargain, and\r\nat which he proposed to reside for some time.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XLII\r\n\r\n\r\nThis is no mine ain house, I ken by the bigging o’t.\r\n_Old Song_.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe nuptial party travelled in great style. There was a coach and six\r\nafter the newest pattern, which Sir Everard had presented to his\r\nnephew, that dazzled with its splendour the eyes of one half of\r\nScotland; there was the family coach of Mr. Rubrick;—both these were\r\ncrowded with ladies,—and there were gentlemen on horseback, with their\r\nservants, to the number of a round score. Nevertheless, without having\r\nthe fear of famine before his eyes, Bailie Macwheeble met them in the\r\nroad to entreat that they would pass by his house at Little Veolan. The\r\nBaron stared, and said his son and he would certainly ride by Little\r\nVeolan and pay their compliments to the Bailie, but could not think of\r\nbringing with them the “haill _comitatus nuptialis_, or matrimonial\r\nprocession.” He added, “that, as he understood that the barony had been\r\nsold by its unworthy possessor, he was glad to see his old friend\r\nDuncan had regained his situation under the new _dominus_, or\r\nproprietor.” The Bailie ducked, bowed, and fidgeted, and then again\r\ninsisted upon his invitation; until the Baron, though rather piqued at\r\nthe pertinacity of his instances, could not nevertheless refuse to\r\nconsent without making evident sensations which he was anxious to\r\nconceal.\r\n\r\nHe fell into a deep study as they approached the top of the avenue, and\r\nwas only startled from it by observing that the battlements were\r\nreplaced, the ruins cleared away, and (most wonderful of all) that the\r\ntwo great stone bears, those mutilated Dagons of his idolatry, had\r\nresumed their posts over the gateway. “Now this new proprietor,” said\r\nhe to Edward, “has shown mair _gusto_, as the Italians call it, in the\r\nshort time he has had this domain, than that hound Malcolm, though I\r\nbred him here mysell, has acquired _vita adhuc durante_. And now I talk\r\nof hounds, is not yon Ban and Buscar who come scouping up the avenue\r\nwith Davie Gellatley?”\r\n\r\n“I vote we should go to meet them, sir,” said Waverley, “for I believe\r\nthe present master of the house is Colonel Talbot, who will expect to\r\nsee us. We hesitated to mention to you at first that he had purchased\r\nyour ancient patrimonial property, and even yet, if you do not incline\r\nto visit him, we can pass on to the Bailie’s.”\r\n\r\nThe Baron had occasion for all his magnanimity. However, he drew a long\r\nbreath, took a long snuff, and observed, since they had brought him so\r\nfar, he could not pass the Colonel’s gate, and he would be happy to see\r\nthe new master of his old tenants. He alighted accordingly, as did the\r\nother gentlemen and ladies; he gave his arm to his daughter, and as\r\nthey descended the avenue pointed out to her how speedily the _Diva\r\nPecunia_ of the Southron—their tutelary deity, he might call her—had\r\nremoved the marks of spoliation.\r\n\r\nIn truth, not only had the felled trees been removed, but, their stumps\r\nbeing grubbed up and the earth round them levelled and sown with grass,\r\nevery mark of devastation, unless to an eye intimately acquainted with\r\nthe spot, was already totally obliterated. There was a similar\r\nreformation in the outward man of Davie Gellatley, who met them, every\r\nnow and then stopping to admire the new suit which graced his person,\r\nin the same colours as formerly, but bedizened fine enough to have\r\nserved Touchstone himself. He danced up with his usual ungainly\r\nfrolics, first to the Baron and then to Rose, passing his hands over\r\nhis clothes, crying, “Bra’, bra’ Davie,” and scarce able to sing a bar\r\nto an end of his thousand-and-one songs for the breathless extravagance\r\nof his joy. The dogs also acknowledged their old master with a thousand\r\ngambols. “Upon my conscience, Rose,” ejaculated the Baron, “the\r\ngratitude o’ thae dumb brutes and of that puir innocent brings the\r\ntears into my auld een, while that schellum Malcolm—but I’m obliged to\r\nColonel Talbot for putting my hounds into such good condition, and\r\nlikewise for puir Davie. But, Rose, my dear, we must not permit them to\r\nbe a life-rent burden upon the estate.”\r\n\r\nAs he spoke, Lady Emily, leaning upon the arm of her husband, met the\r\nparty at the lower gate with a thousand welcomes. After the ceremony of\r\nintroduction had been gone through, much abridged by the ease and\r\nexcellent breeding of Lady Emily, she apologised for having used a\r\nlittle art to wile them back to a place which might awaken some painful\r\nreflections—“But as it was to change masters, we were very desirous\r\nthat the Baron—”\r\n\r\n“Mr. Bradwardine, madam, if you please,” said the old gentleman.\r\n\r\n“—Mr. Bradwardine, then, and Mr. Waverley should see what we have done\r\ntowards restoring the mansion of your fathers to its former state.”\r\n\r\nThe Baron answered with a low bow. Indeed, when he entered the court,\r\nexcepting that the heavy stables, which had been burnt down, were\r\nreplaced by buildings of a lighter and more picturesque appearance, all\r\nseemed as much as possible restored to the state in which he had left\r\nit when he assumed arms some months before. The pigeon-house was\r\nreplenished; the fountain played with its usual activity, and not only\r\nthe bear who predominated over its basin, but all the other bears\r\nwhatsoever, were replaced on their several stations, and renewed or\r\nrepaired with so much care that they bore no tokens of the violence\r\nwhich had so lately descended upon them. While these _minutiæ_ had been\r\nso needfully attended to, it is scarce necessary to add that the house\r\nitself had been thoroughly repaired, as well as the gardens, with the\r\nstrictest attention to maintain the original character of both, and to\r\nremove as far as possible all appearance of the ravage they had\r\nsustained. The Baron gazed in silent wonder; at length he addressed\r\nColonel Talbot—\r\n\r\n“While I acknowledge my obligation to you, sir, for the restoration of\r\nthe badge of our family, I cannot but marvel that you have nowhere\r\nestablished your own crest, whilk is, I believe, a mastiff, anciently\r\ncalled a talbot; as the poet has it,\r\n\r\n“‘A talbot strong,—a sturdy tyke.’\r\n\r\n\r\nAt least such a dog is the crest of the martial and renowned Earls of\r\nShrewsbury, to whom your family are probably blood-relations.”\r\n\r\n“I believe,” said the Colonel, smiling, “our dogs are whelps of the\r\nsame litter; for my part, if crests were to dispute precedence, I\r\nshould be apt to let them, as the proverb says, ‘fight dog, fight\r\nbear.’”\r\n\r\nAs he made this speech, at which the Baron took another long pinch of\r\nsnuff, they had entered the house, that is, the Baron, Rose, and Lady\r\nEmily, with young Stanley and the Bailie, for Edward and the rest of\r\nthe party remained on the terrace to examine a new greenhouse stocked\r\nwith the finest plants. The Baron resumed his favourite topic—“However\r\nit may please you to derogate from the honour of your burgonet, Colonel\r\nTalbot, which is doubtless your humour, as I have seen in other\r\ngentlemen of birth and honour in your country, I must again repeat it\r\nas a most ancient and distinguished bearing, as well as that of my\r\nyoung friend Francis Stanley, which is the eagle and child.”\r\n\r\n“The bird and bantling they call it in Derbyshire, sir,” said Stanley.\r\n\r\n“Ye’re a daft callant, sir,” said the Baron, who had a great liking to\r\nthis young man, perhaps because he sometimes teased him—“Ye’re a daft\r\ncallant, and I must correct you some of these days,” shaking his great\r\nbrown fist at him. “But what I meant to say, Colonel Talbot, is, that\r\nyours is an ancient _prosapia_, or descent, and since you have lawfully\r\nand justly acquired the estate for you and yours which I have lost for\r\nme and mine, I wish it may remain in your name as many centuries as it\r\nhas done in that of the late proprietor’s.”\r\n\r\n“That,” answered the Colonel, “is very handsome, Mr. Bradwardine,\r\nindeed.”\r\n\r\n“And yet, sir, I cannot but marvel that you, Colonel, whom I noted to\r\nhave so much of the _amor patritæ_, when we met in Edinburgh as even to\r\nvilipend other countries, should have chosen to establish your Lares,\r\nor household gods, _procul a patriæ finibus_, and in a manner to\r\nexpatriate yourself.”\r\n\r\n“Why really, Baron, I do not see why, to keep the secret of these\r\nfoolish boys, Waverley and Stanley, and of my wife, who is no wiser,\r\none old soldier should continue to impose upon another. You must know,\r\nthen, that I have so much of that same prejudice in favour of my native\r\ncountry, that the sum of money which I advanced to the seller of this\r\nextensive barony has only purchased for me a box in ——shire, called\r\nBrerewood Lodge, with about two hundred and fifty acres of land, the\r\nchief merit of which is, that it is within a very few miles of\r\nWaverley-Honour.”\r\n\r\n“And who, then, in the name of Heaven, has bought this property?”\r\n\r\n“That,” said the Colonel, “it is this gentleman’s profession to\r\nexplain.”\r\n\r\nThe Bailie, whom this reference regarded, and who had all this while\r\nshifted from one foot to another with great impatience, “like a hen,”\r\nas he afterwards said, “upon a het girdle”; and chuckling, he might\r\nhave added, like the said hen in all the glory of laying an egg, now\r\npushed forward. “That I can, that I can, your Honour,” drawing from his\r\npocket a budget of papers, and untying the red tape with a hand\r\ntrembling with eagerness. “Here is the disposition and assignation by\r\nMalcolm Bradwardine of Inch-Grabbit, regularly signed and tested in\r\nterms of the statute, whereby, for a certain sum of sterling money\r\npresently contented and paid to him, he has disponed, alienated, and\r\nconveyed the whole estate and barony of Bradwardine, Tully-Veolan, and\r\nothers, with the fortalice and manor-place—”\r\n\r\n“For God’s sake, to the point, sir; I have all that by heart,” said the\r\nColonel.\r\n\r\n“—To Cosmo Comyne Bradwardine, Esq.,” pursued the Bailie, “his heirs and\r\nassignees, simply and irredeemably, to be held either _a me vel de\r\nme_—”\r\n\r\n“Pray read short, sir.”\r\n\r\n“On the conscience of an honest man, Colonel, I read as short as is\r\nconsistent with style—under the burden and reservation always—”\r\n\r\n“Mr. Macwheeble, this would outlast a Russian winter; give me leave. In\r\nshort, Mr. Bradwardine, your family estate is your own once more in\r\nfull property, and at your absolute disposal, but only burdened with\r\nthe sum advanced to re-purchase it, which I understand is utterly\r\ndisproportioned to its value.”\r\n\r\n“An auld sang—an auld sang, if it please your Honours,” cried the\r\nBailie, rubbing his hands; “look at the rental book.”\r\n\r\n“—Which sum being advanced, by Mr. Edward Waverley, chiefly from the\r\nprice of his father’s property which I bought from him, is secured to\r\nhis lady your daughter and her family by this marriage.”\r\n\r\n“It is a catholic security,” shouted the Bailie,” to Rose Comyne\r\nBradwardine, _alias_ Wauverley, in life-rent, and the children of the\r\nsaid marriage in fee; and I made up a wee bit minute of an antenuptial\r\ncontract, _intuitu matrimonij_, so it cannot be subject to reduction\r\nhereafter, as a donation _inter virum et uxorem_.”\r\n\r\nIt is difficult to say whether the worthy Baron was most delighted with\r\nthe restitution of his family property or with the delicacy and\r\ngenerosity that left him unfettered to pursue his purpose in disposing\r\nof it after his death, and which avoided as much as possible even the\r\nappearance of laying him under pecuniary obligation. When his first\r\npause of joy and astonishment was over, his thoughts turned to the\r\nunworthy heir-male, who, he pronounced, had sold his birthright, like\r\nEsau, for a mess o’ pottage.\r\n\r\n“But wha cookit the parritch for him?” exclaimed the Bailie; “I wad\r\nlike to ken that;—wha but your Honour’s to command, Duncan Macwheeble?\r\nHis Honour, young Mr. Wauverley, put it a’ into my hand frae the\r\nbeginning—frae the first calling o’ the summons, as I may say. I\r\ncircumvented them—I played at bogle about the bush wi’ them—I cajolled\r\nthem; and if I havena gien Inch-Grabbit and Jamie Howie a bonnie\r\nbegunk, they ken themselves. Him a writer! I didna gae slapdash to them\r\nwi’ our young bra’ bridegroom, to gar them baud up the market. Na, na;\r\nI scared them wi’ our wild tenantry, and the Mac-Ivors, that are but\r\nill settled yet, till they durstna on ony errand whatsoever gang ower\r\nthe doorstane after gloaming, for fear John Heatherblutter, or some\r\nsiccan dare-the-deil, should tak a baff at them; then, on the other\r\nhand, I beflummed them wi’ Colonel Talbot; wad they offer to keep up\r\nthe price again’ the Duke’s friend? did they na ken wha was master? had\r\nthey na seen eneugh, by the sad example of mony a puir misguided\r\nunhappy body—”\r\n\r\n“Who went to Derby, for example, Mr. Macwheeble?” said the Colonel to\r\nhim aside.\r\n\r\n“O whisht, Colonel, for the love o’ God! let that flee stick i’ the\r\nwa’. There were mony good folk at Derby; and it’s ill speaking of\r\nhalters”—with a sly cast of his eye toward the Baron, who was in a deep\r\nreverie.\r\n\r\nStarting out of it at once, he took Macwheeble by the button and led\r\nhim into one of the deep window recesses, whence only fragments of\r\ntheir conversation reached the rest of the party. It certainly related\r\nto stamp-paper and parchment; for no other subject, even from the mouth\r\nof his patron, and he once more an efficient one, could have arrested\r\nso deeply the Bailie’s reverent and absorbed attention.\r\n\r\n“I understand your Honour perfectly; it can be dune as easy as taking\r\nout a decreet in absence.”\r\n\r\n“To her and him, after my demise, and to their heirs-male, but\r\npreferring the second son, if God shall bless them with two, who is to\r\ncarry the name and arms of Bradwardine of that ilk, without any other\r\nname or armorial bearings whatsoever.”\r\n\r\n“Tut, your Honour!” whispered the Bailie, “I’ll mak a slight jotting\r\nthe morn; it will cost but a charter of resignation _in favorem;_ and\r\nI’ll hae it ready for the next term in Exchequer.”\r\n\r\nTheir private conversation ended, the Baron was now summoned to do the\r\nhonours of Tully-Veolan to new guests. These were Major Melville of\r\nCairnvreckan and the Reverend Mr. Morton, followed by two or three\r\nothers of the Baron’s acquaintances, who had been made privy to his\r\nhaving again acquired the estate of his fathers. The shouts of the\r\nvillagers were also heard beneath in the courtyard; for Saunders\r\nSaunderson, who had kept the secret for several days with laudable\r\nprudence, had unloosed his tongue upon beholding the arrival of the\r\ncarriages.\r\n\r\nBut, while Edward received Major Melville with politeness and the\r\nclergyman with the most affectionate and grateful kindness, his\r\nfather-in-law looked a little awkward, as uncertain how he should\r\nanswer the necessary claims of hospitality to his guests, and forward\r\nthe festivity of his tenants. Lady Emily relieved him by intimating\r\nthat, though she must be an indifferent representative of Mrs. Edward\r\nWaverley in many respects, she hoped the Baron would approve of the\r\nentertainment she had ordered in expectation of so many guests; and\r\nthat they would find such other accommodations provided as might in\r\nsome degree support the ancient hospitality of Tully-Veolan. It is\r\nimpossible to describe the pleasure which this assurance gave the\r\nBaron, who, with an air of gallantry half appertaining to the stiff\r\nScottish laird and half to the officer in the French service, offered\r\nhis arm to the fair speaker, and led the way, in something between a\r\nstride and a minuet step, into the large dining parlour, followed by\r\nall the rest of the good company.\r\n\r\nBy dint of Saunderson’s directions and exertions, all here, as well as\r\nin the other apartments, had been disposed as much as possible\r\naccording to the old arrangement; and where new movables had been\r\nnecessary, they had been selected in the same character with the old\r\nfurniture. There was one addition to this fine old apartment, however,\r\nwhich drew tears into the Baron’s eyes. It was a large and spirited\r\npainting, representing Fergus Mac-Ivor and Waverley in their Highland\r\ndress, the scene a wild, rocky, and mountainous pass, down which the\r\nclan were descending in the background. It was taken from a spirited\r\nsketch, drawn while they were in Edinburgh by a young man of high\r\ngenius, and had been painted on a full-length scale by an eminent\r\nLondon artist. Raeburn himself (whose “Highland Chiefs” do all but walk\r\nout of the canvas) could not have done more justice to the subject; and\r\nthe ardent, fiery, and impetuous character of the unfortunate Chief of\r\nGlennaquoich was finely contrasted with the contemplative, fanciful,\r\nand enthusiastic expression of his happier friend. Beside this painting\r\nhung the arms which Waverley had borne in the unfortunate civil war.\r\nThe whole piece was beheld with admiration and deeper feelings.\r\n\r\nMen must, however, eat, in spite both of sentiment and _vertu;_ and the\r\nBaron, while he assumed the lower end of the table, insisted that Lady\r\nEmily should do the honours of the head, that they might, he said, set\r\na meet example to the _young folk_. After a pause of deliberation,\r\nemployed in adjusting in his own brain the precedence between the\r\nPresbyterian kirk and Episcopal church of Scotland, he requested Mr.\r\nMorton, as the stranger, would crave a blessing, observing that Mr.\r\nRubrick, who was at _home_, would return thanks for the distinguished\r\nmercies it had been his lot to experience. The dinner was excellent.\r\nSaunderson attended in full costume, with all the former domestics, who\r\nhad been collected, excepting one or two, that had not been heard of\r\nsince the affair of Culloden. The cellars were stocked with wine which\r\nwas pronounced to be superb, and it had been contrived that the Bear of\r\nthe Fountain, in the courtyard, should (for that night only) play\r\nexcellent brandy punch for the benefit of the lower orders.\r\n\r\nWhen the dinner was over the Baron, about to propose a toast, cast a\r\nsomewhat sorrowful look upon the sideboard, which, however, exhibited\r\nmuch of his plate, that had either been secreted or purchased by\r\nneighbouring gentlemen from the soldiery, and by them gladly restored\r\nto the original owner.\r\n\r\n“In the late times,” he said, “those must be thankful who have saved\r\nlife and land; yet when I am about to pronounce this toast, I cannot\r\nbut regret an old heirloom, Lady Emily, a _poculum potatorium_, Colonel\r\nTalbot—”\r\n\r\nHere the Baron’s elbow was gently touched by his major-domo, and,\r\nturning round, he beheld in the hands of Alexander ab Alexandro the\r\ncelebrated cup of Saint Duthac, the Blessed Bear of Bradwardine! I\r\nquestion if the recovery of his estate afforded him more rapture. “By\r\nmy honour,” he said, “one might almost believe in brownies and fairies,\r\nLady Emily, when your ladyship is in presence!”\r\n\r\n“I am truly happy,” said Colonel Talbot, “that, by the recovery of this\r\npiece of family antiquity, it has fallen within my power to give you\r\nsome token of my deep interest in all that concerns my young friend\r\nEdward. But that you may not suspect Lady Emily for a sorceress, or me\r\nfor a conjuror, which is no joke in Scotland, I must tell you that\r\nFrank Stanley, your friend, who has been seized with a tartan fever\r\never since he heard Edward’s tales of old Scottish manners, happened to\r\ndescribe to us at second-hand this remarkable cup. My servant,\r\nSpontoon, who, like a true old soldier, observes everything and says\r\nlittle, gave me afterwards to understand that he thought he had seen\r\nthe piece of plate Mr. Stanley mentioned in the possession of a certain\r\nMrs. Nosebag, who, having been originally the helpmate of a pawnbroker,\r\nhad found opportunity during the late unpleasant scenes in Scotland to\r\ntrade a little in her old line, and so became the depositary of the\r\nmore valuable part of the spoil of half the army. You may believe the\r\ncup was speedily recovered; and it will give me very great pleasure if\r\nyou allow me to suppose that its value is not diminished by having been\r\nrestored through my means.”\r\n\r\nA tear mingled with the wine which the Baron filled, as he proposed a\r\ncup of gratitude to Colonel Talbot, and “The Prosperity of the united\r\nHouses of Waverley-Honour and Bradwardine!”\r\n\r\nIt only remains for me to say that, as no wish was ever uttered with\r\nmore affectionate sincerity, there are few which, allowing for the\r\nnecessary mutability of human events, have been upon the whole more\r\nhappily fulfilled.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XLIII.\r\nA POSTSCRIPT WHICH SHOULD HAVE BEEN A PREFACE\r\n\r\n\r\nOur journey is now finished, gentle reader; and if your patience has\r\naccompanied me through these sheets, the contract is, on your part,\r\nstrictly fulfilled. Yet, like the driver who has received his full\r\nhire, I still linger near you, and make, with becoming diffidence, a\r\ntrifling additional claim upon your bounty and good nature. You are as\r\nfree, however, to shut the volume of the one petitioner as to close\r\nyour door in the face of the other.\r\n\r\nThis should have been a prefatory chapter, but for two reasons: First,\r\nthat most novel readers, as my own conscience reminds me, are apt to be\r\nguilty of the sin of omission respecting that same matter of prefaces;\r\nSecondly, that it is a general custom with that class of students to\r\nbegin with the last chapter of a work; so that, after all, these\r\nremarks, being introduced last in order, have still the best chance to\r\nbe read in their proper place.\r\n\r\nThere is no European nation which, within the course of half a century\r\nor little more, has undergone so complete a change as this kingdom of\r\nScotland. The effects of the insurrection of 1745,—the destruction of\r\nthe patriarchal power of the Highland chiefs,—the abolition of the\r\nheritable jurisdictions of the Lowland nobility and barons,—the total\r\neradication of the Jacobite party, which, averse to intermingle with\r\nthe English, or adopt their customs, long continued to pride themselves\r\nupon maintaining ancient Scottish manners and customs,—commenced this\r\ninnovation. The gradual influx of wealth and extension of commerce have\r\nsince united to render the present people of Scotland a class of beings\r\nas different from their grandfathers as the existing English are from\r\nthose of Queen Elizabeth’s time. The political and economical effects\r\nof these changes have been traced by Lord Selkirk with great precision\r\nand accuracy. But the change, though steadily and rapidly progressive,\r\nhas nevertheless been gradual; and, like those who drift down the\r\nstream of a deep and smooth river, we are not aware of the progress we\r\nhave made until we fix our eye on the now distant point from which we\r\nhave been drifted. Such of the present generation as can recollect the\r\nlast twenty or twenty-five years of the eighteenth century will be\r\nfully sensible of the truth of this statement; especially if their\r\nacquaintance and connections lay among those who in my younger time\r\nwere facetiously called “folks of the old leaven,” who still cherished\r\na lingering, though hopeless, attachment to the house of Stuart. This\r\nrace has now almost entirely vanished from the land, and with it,\r\ndoubtless, much absurd political prejudice; but also many living\r\nexamples of singular and disinterested attachment to the principles of\r\nloyalty which they received from their fathers, and of old Scottish\r\nfaith, hospitality, worth, and honour.\r\n\r\nIt was my accidental lot, though not born a Highlander (which may be an\r\napology for much bad Gaelic), to reside during my childhood and youth\r\namong persons of the above description; and now, for the purpose of\r\npreserving some idea of the ancient manners of which I have witnessed\r\nthe almost total extinction, I have embodied in imaginary scenes, and\r\nascribed to fictitious characters, a part of the incidents which I then\r\nreceived from those who were actors in them. Indeed, the most romantic\r\nparts of this narrative are precisely those which have a foundation in\r\nfact. The exchange of mutual protection between a Highland gentleman\r\nand an officer of rank in the king’s service, together with the\r\nspirited manner in which the latter asserted his right to return the\r\nfavour he had received, is literally true. The accident by a musket\r\nshot, and the heroic reply imputed to Flora, relate to a lady of rank\r\nnot long deceased. And scarce a gentleman who was “in hiding” after the\r\nbattle of Culloden but could tell a tale of strange concealments and of\r\nwild and hair’s-breadth ’scapes as extraordinary as any which I have\r\nascribed to my heroes. Of this, the escape of Charles Edward himself,\r\nas the most prominent, is the most striking example. The accounts of\r\nthe battle of Preston and skirmish at Clifton are taken from the\r\nnarrative of intelligent eye-witnesses, and corrected from the “History\r\nof the Rebellion” by the late venerable author of “Douglas.” The\r\nLowland Scottish gentlemen and the subordinate characters are not given\r\nas individual portraits, but are drawn from the general habits of the\r\nperiod, of which I have witnessed some remnants in my younger days, and\r\npartly gathered from tradition.\r\n\r\nIt has been my object to describe these persons, not by a caricatured\r\nand exaggerated use of the national dialect, but by their habits,\r\nmanners, and feelings, so as in some distant degree to emulate the\r\nadmirable Irish portraits drawn by Miss Edgeworth, so different from\r\nthe “Teagues” and “dear joys” who so long, with the most perfect family\r\nresemblance to each other, occupied the drama and the novel.\r\n\r\nI feel no confidence, however, in the manner in which I have executed\r\nmy purpose. Indeed, so little was I satisfied with my production, that\r\nI laid it aside in an unfinished state, and only found it again by mere\r\naccident among other waste papers in an old cabinet, the drawers of\r\nwhich I was rummaging in order to accommodate a friend with some\r\nfishing-tackle, after it had been mislaid for several years.\r\n\r\nTwo works upon similar subjects, by female authors whose genius is\r\nhighly creditable to their country, have appeared in the interval; I\r\nmean Mrs. Hamilton’s “Glenburnie” and the late account of “Highland\r\nSuperstitions.” But the first is confined to the rural habits of\r\nScotland, of which it has given a picture with striking and impressive\r\nfidelity; and the traditional records of the respectable and ingenious\r\nMrs. Grant of Laggan are of a nature distinct from the fictitious\r\nnarrative which I have here attempted.\r\n\r\nI would willingly persuade myself that the preceding work will not be\r\nfound altogether uninteresting. To elder persons it will recall scenes\r\nand characters familiar to their youth; and to the rising generation\r\nthe tale may present some idea of the manners of their forefathers.\r\n\r\nYet I heartily wish that the task of tracing the evanescent manners of\r\nhis own country had employed the pen of the only man in Scotland who\r\ncould have done it justice—of him so eminently distinguished in elegant\r\nliterature, and whose sketches of Colonel Caustic and Umphraville are\r\nperfectly blended with the finer traits of national character. I should\r\nin that case have had more pleasure as a reader than I shall ever feel\r\nin the pride of a successful author, should these sheets confer upon me\r\nthat envied distinction. And, as I have inverted the usual arrangement,\r\nplacing these remarks at the end of the work to which they refer, I\r\nwill venture on a second violation of form, by closing the whole with a\r\nDedication—\r\n\r\nTHESE VOLUMES\r\nBEING RESPECTFULLY INSCRIBED\r\nTO\r\nOUR SCOTTISH ADDISON,\r\nHENRY MACKENZIE,\r\nBY\r\nAN UNKNOWN ADMIRER\r\nOF\r\nHIS GENIUS.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNOTES—Volume I.\r\n\r\n\r\nNOTE 1\r\n\r\nLong the oracle of the country gentlemen of the high Tory party. The\r\nancient News-Letter was written in manuscript and copied by clerks, who\r\naddressed the copies to the subscribers. The politician by whom they\r\nwere compiled picked up his intelligence at coffee-houses, and often\r\npleaded for an additional gratuity in consideration of the extra\r\nexpense attached to frequenting such places of fashionable resort.\r\n\r\nNOTE 2\r\n\r\nThere is a family legend to this purpose, belonging to the knightly\r\nfamily of Bradshaigh, the proprietors of Haigh Hall, in Lancashire,\r\nwhere, I have been told, the event is recorded on a painted glass\r\nwindow. The German ballad of the Noble Moringer turns upon a similar\r\ntopic. But undoubtedly many such incidents may have taken place, where,\r\nthe distance being great and the intercourse infrequent, false reports\r\nconcerning the fate of the absent Crusaders must have been commonly\r\ncirculated, and sometimes perhaps rather hastily credited at home.\r\n\r\nNOTE 3\r\n\r\nThe attachment to this classic was, it is said, actually displayed in\r\nthe manner mentioned in the text by an unfortunate Jacobite in that\r\nunhappy period. He escaped from the jail in which he was confined for a\r\nhasty trial and certain condemnation, and was retaken as he hovered\r\naround the place in which he had been imprisoned, for which he could\r\ngive no better reason than the hope of recovering his favourite Titus\r\nLivius. I am sorry to add that the simplicity of such a character was\r\nfound to form no apology for his guilt as a rebel, and that he was\r\ncondemned and executed.\r\n\r\nNOTE 4\r\n\r\nNicholas Amhurst, a noted political writer, who conducted for many\r\nyears a paper called the Craftsman, under the assumed name of Caleb\r\nD’Anvers. He was devoted to the Tory interest, and seconded with much\r\nability the attacks of Pulteney on Sir Robert Walpole. He died in 1742,\r\nneglected by his great patrons and in the most miserable circumstances.\r\n\r\n“Amhurst survived the downfall of Walpole’s power, and had reason to\r\nexpect a reward for his labours. If we excuse Bolingbroke, who had only\r\nsaved the shipwreck of his fortunes, we shall be at a loss to justify\r\nPulteney, who could with ease have given this man a considerable\r\nincome. The utmost of his generosity to Amhurst that I ever heard of\r\nwas a hogshead of claret! He died, it is supposed, of a broken heart;\r\nand was buried at the charge of his honest printer, Richard\r\nFrancklin” (_Lord Chesterfield’s Characters Reviewed_, p. 42).\r\n\r\nNOTE 5\r\n\r\nI have now given in the text the full name of this gallant and\r\nexcellent man, and proceed to copy the account of his remarkable\r\nconversion, as related by Doctor Doddridge.\r\n\r\n“This memorable event,” says the pious writer, “happened towards the\r\nmiddle of July 1719. The major had spent the evening (and, if I mistake\r\nnot, it was the Sabbath) in some gay company, and had an unhappy\r\nassignation with a married woman, whom he was to attend exactly at\r\ntwelve. The company broke up about eleven, and, not judging it\r\nconvenient to anticipate the time appointed, he went into his chamber\r\nto kill the tedious hour, perhaps with some amusing book, or some other\r\nway. But it very accidentally happened that he took up a religious\r\nbook, which his good mother or aunt had, without his knowledge, slipped\r\ninto his portmanteau. It was called, if I remember the title exactly,\r\nThe Christian Soldier, or Heaven taken by Storm, and it was written by\r\nMr. Thomas Watson. Guessing by the title of it that he would find some\r\nphrases of his own profession spiritualised in a manner which he\r\nthought might afford him some diversion, he resolved to dip into it,\r\nbut he took no serious notice of anything it had in it; and yet, while\r\nthis book was in his hand, an impression was made upon his mind\r\n(perhaps God only knows how) which drew after it a train of the most\r\nimportant and happy consequences. He thought he saw an unusual blaze of\r\nlight fall upon the book which he was reading, which he at first\r\nimagined might happen by some accident in the candle, but, lifting up\r\nhis eyes, he apprehended to his extreme amazement that there was before\r\nhim, as it were suspended in the air, a visible representation of the\r\nLord Jesus Christ upon the cross, surrounded on all sides with a glory;\r\nand was impressed as if a voice, or something equivalent to a voice,\r\nhad come to him, to this effect (for he was not confident as to the\r\nwords), “Oh, sinner! did I suffer this for thee, and are these thy\r\nreturns?” Struck with so amazing a phenomenon as this, there remained\r\nhardly any life in him, so that he sunk down in the arm-chair in which\r\nhe sat, and continued, he knew not how long, insensible.”\r\n\r\n“With regard to this vision,” says the ingenious Dr. Hibbert, “the\r\nappearance of our Saviour on the cross, and the awful words repeated,\r\ncan be considered in no other light than as so many recollected images\r\nof the mind, which probably had their origin in the language of some\r\nurgent appeal to repentance that the colonel might have casually read\r\nor heard delivered. From what cause, however, such ideas were rendered\r\nas vivid as actual impressions, we have no information to be depended\r\nupon. This vision was certainly attended with one of the most important\r\nof consequences connected with the Christian dispensation—the\r\nconversion of a sinner. And hence no single narrative has, perhaps,\r\ndone more to confirm the superstitious opinion that apparitions of this\r\nawful kind cannot arise without a divine fiat.” Doctor Hibbert adds in\r\na note—“A short time before the vision, Colonel Gardiner had received a\r\nsevere fall from his horse. Did the brain receive some slight degree of\r\ninjury from the accident, so as to predispose him to this spiritual\r\nillusion?” (_Hibbert’s Philosophy of Apparitions_, Edinburgh, 1824, p.\r\n190.)\r\n\r\nNOTE 6\r\n\r\nThe courtesy of an invitation to partake a traveller’s meal, or at\r\nleast that of being invited to share whatever liquor the guest called\r\nfor, was expected by certain old landlords in Scotland even in the\r\nyouth of the author. In requital mine host was always furnished with\r\nthe news of the country, and was probably a little of a humorist to\r\nboot. The devolution of the whole actual business and drudgery of the\r\ninn upon the poor gudewife was very common among the Scottish\r\nBonifaces. There was in ancient times, in the city of Edinburgh, a\r\ngentleman of good family who condescended, in order to gain a\r\nlivelihood, to become the nominal keeper of a coffee-house, one of the\r\nfirst places of the kind which had been opened in the Scottish\r\nmetropolis. As usual, it was entirely managed by the careful and\r\nindustrious Mrs. B—; while her husband amused himself with field\r\nsports, without troubling his head about the matter. Once upon a time,\r\nthe premises having taken fire, the husband was met walking up the High\r\nStreet loaded with his guns and fishing-rods, and replied calmly to\r\nsomeone who inquired after his wife, “that the poor woman was trying to\r\nsave a parcel of crockery and some trumpery books”; the last being\r\nthose which served her to conduct the business of the house.\r\n\r\nThere were many elderly gentlemen in the author’s younger days who\r\nstill held it part of the amusement of a journey “to parley with mine\r\nhost,” who often resembled, in his quaint humour, mine Host of the\r\nGarter in the Merry Wives of Windsor; or Blague of the George in the\r\nMerry Devil of Edmonton. Sometimes the landlady took her share of\r\nentertaining the company. In either case the omitting to pay them due\r\nattention gave displeasure, and perhaps brought down a smart jest, as\r\non the following occasion:\r\n\r\nA jolly dame who, not “Sixty Years Since,” kept the principal\r\ncaravansary at Greenlaw, in Berwickshire, had the honour to receive\r\nunder her roof a very worthy clergyman, with three sons of the same\r\nprofession, each having a cure of souls; be it said in passing, none of\r\nthe reverend party were reckoned powerful in the pulpit. After dinner\r\nwas over, the worthy senior, in the pride of his heart, asked Mrs.\r\nBuchan whether she ever had had such a party in her house before. “Here\r\nsit I,” he said, “a placed minister of the Kirk of Scotland, and here\r\nsit my three sons, each a placed minister of the same kirk. Confess,\r\nLuckie Buchan, you never had such a party in your house before.” The\r\nquestion was not premised by any invitation to sit down and take a\r\nglass of wine or the like, so Mrs. B. answered drily, “Indeed, sir, I\r\ncannot just say that ever I had such a party in my house before, except\r\nonce in the forty-five, when I had a Highland piper here, with his\r\nthree sons, all Highland pipers; _and deil a spring they could play\r\namang them_.”\r\n\r\nNOTE 7\r\n\r\nThere is no particular mansion described under the name of\r\nTully-Veolan; but the peculiarities of the description occur in various\r\nold Scottish seats. The House of Warrender upon Bruntsfield Links and\r\nthat of Old Ravelston, belonging, the former to Sir George Warrender,\r\nthe latter to Sir Alexander Keith, have both contributed several hints\r\nto the description in the text. The House of Dean, near Edinburgh, has\r\nalso some points of resemblance with Tully-Veolan. The author has,\r\nhowever, been informed that the House of Grandtully resembles that of\r\nthe Baron of Bradwardine still more than any of the above.\r\n\r\nNOTE 8\r\n\r\nI am ignorant how long the ancient and established custom of keeping\r\nfools has been disused in England. Swift writes an epitaph on the Earl\r\nof Suffolk’s fool,—\r\n\r\nWhose name was Dickie Pearce\r\n\r\nIn Scotland, the custom subsisted till late in the last century; at\r\nGlamis Castle is preserved the dress of one of the jesters, very\r\nhandsome, and ornamented with many bells. It is not above thirty years\r\nsince such a character stood by the sideboard of a nobleman of the\r\nfirst rank in Scotland, and occasionally mixed in the conversation,\r\ntill he carried the joke rather too far, in making proposals to one of\r\nthe young ladies of the family, and publishing the bans betwixt her and\r\nhimself in the public church.\r\n\r\nNOTE 9\r\n\r\nAfter the Revolution of 1688, and on some occasions when the spirit of\r\nthe Presbyterians had been unusually animated against their opponents,\r\nthe Episcopal clergymen, who were chiefly nonjurors, were exposed to be\r\nmobbed, as we should now say, or rabbled, as the phrase then went, to\r\nexpiate their political heresies. But notwithstanding that the\r\nPresbyterians had the persecution in Charles II. and his brother’s time\r\nto exasperate them, there was little mischief done beyond the kind of\r\npetty violence mentioned in the text.\r\n\r\nNOTE 10\r\n\r\nI may here mention that the fashion of compotation described in the\r\ntext was still occasionally practised in Scotland in the author’s\r\nyouth. A company, after having taken leave of their host, often went to\r\nfinish the evening at the clachan or village, in “womb of tavern.”\r\nTheir entertainer always accompanied them to take the stirrup-cup,\r\nwhich often occasioned a long and late revel.\r\n\r\nThe _Poculum Potatorium_ of the valiant Baron, his blessed Bear, has a\r\nprototype at the fine old Castle of Glamis, so rich in memorials of\r\nancient times; it is a massive beaker of silver, double gilt, moulded\r\ninto the shape of a lion, and holding about an English pint of wine.\r\nThe form alludes to the family name of Strathmore, which is Lyon, and,\r\nwhen exhibited, the cup must necessarily be emptied to the Earl’s\r\nhealth. The author ought perhaps to be ashamed of recording that he has\r\nhad the honour of swallowing the contents of the Lion; and the\r\nrecollection of the feat served to suggest the story of the Bear of\r\nBradwardine. In the family of Scott of Thirlestane (not Thirlestane in\r\nthe Forest, but the place of the same name in Roxburghshire) was long\r\npreserved a cup of the same kind, in the form of a jack-boot. Each\r\nguest was obliged to empty this at his departure. If the guest’s name\r\nwas Scott, the necessity was doubly imperative.\r\n\r\nWhen the landlord of an inn presented his guests with _deoch an\r\ndoruis_, that is, the drink at the door, or the stirrup-cup, the\r\ndraught was not charged in the reckoning. On this point a learned\r\nbailie of the town of Forfar pronounced a very sound judgment.\r\n\r\nA., an ale-wife in Forfar, had brewed her “peck of malt” and set the\r\nliquor out of doors to cool; the cow of B., a neighbour of A., chanced\r\nto come by, and seeing the good beverage, was allured to taste it, and\r\nfinally to drink it up. When A. came to take in her liquor, she found\r\nher tub empty, and from the cow’s staggering and staring, so as to\r\nbetray her intemperance, she easily divined the mode in which her\r\n“browst” had disappeared. To take vengeance on Crummie’s ribs with a\r\nstick was her first effort. The roaring of the cow brought B., her\r\nmaster, who remonstrated with his angry neighbour, and received in\r\nreply a demand for the value of the ale which Crummie had drunk up. B.\r\nrefused payment, and was conveyed before C., the bailie, or sitting\r\nmagistrate. He heard the case patiently; and then demanded of the\r\nplaintiff A. whether the cow had sat down to her potation or taken it\r\nstanding. The plaintiff answered, she had not seen the deed committed,\r\nbut she supposed the cow drank the ale while standing on her feet,\r\nadding, that had she been near she would have made her use them to some\r\npurpose. The bailie, on this admission, solemnly adjudged the cow’s\r\ndrink to be _deoch an doruis_, a stirrup-cup, for which no charge could\r\nbe made without violating the ancient hospitality of Scotland.\r\n\r\nNOTE 11\r\n\r\nThe story last told was said to have happened in the south of Scotland;\r\nbut _cedant arma togæ_ and let the gown have its dues. It was an old\r\nclergyman, who had wisdom and firmness enough to resist the panic which\r\nseized his brethren, who was the means of rescuing a poor insane\r\ncreature from the cruel fate which would otherwise have overtaken her.\r\nThe accounts of the trials for witchcraft form one of the most\r\ndeplorable chapters in Scottish story.\r\n\r\nNOTE 12\r\n\r\nAlthough canting heraldry is generally reprobated, it seems\r\nnevertheless to have been adopted in the arms and mottos of many\r\nhonourable families. Thus the motto of the Vernons, Ver non semper\r\nviret, is a perfect pun, and so is that of the Onslows, Festina lente.\r\nThe Periissem ni per-iissem of the Anstruthers is liable to a similar\r\nobjection. One of that ancient race, finding that an antagonist, with\r\nwhom he had fixed a friendly meeting, was determined to take the\r\nopportunity of assassinating him, prevented the hazard by dashing out\r\nhis brains with a battle-axe. Two sturdy arms, brandishing such a\r\nweapon, form the usual crest of the family, with the above motto,\r\nPeriissem ni per-iissem—I had died, unless I had gone through with it.\r\n\r\nNOTE 13\r\n\r\nMac-Donald of Barrisdale, one of the very last Highland gentlemen who\r\ncarried on the plundering system to any great extent, was a scholar and\r\na well-bred gentleman. He engraved on his broadswords the well-known\r\nlines—\r\n\r\nHæ tibi erunt artes pacisque imponere morem,\r\nParcere subjectis, et debellare superbos.\r\n\r\n\r\nIndeed, the levying of black-mail was, before 1745, practised by\r\nseveral chiefs of very high rank, who, in doing so, contended that they\r\nwere lending the laws the assistance of their arms and swords, and\r\naffording a protection which could not be obtained from the magistracy\r\nin the disturbed state of the country. The author has seen a Memoir of\r\nMac-Pherson of Cluny, chief of that ancient clan, from which it appears\r\nthat he levied protection-money to a very large amount, which was\r\nwillingly paid even by some of his most powerful neighbours. A\r\ngentleman of this clan, hearing a clergyman hold forth to his\r\ncongregation on the crime of theft, interrupted the preacher to assure\r\nhim, he might leave the enforcement of such doctrines to Cluny\r\nMac-Pherson, whose broadsword would put a stop to theft sooner than all\r\nthe sermons of all the ministers of the Synod.\r\n\r\nNOTE 14\r\n\r\nThe Town-guard of Edinburgh were, till a late period, armed with this\r\nweapon when on their police-duty. There was a hook at the back of the\r\naxe, which the ancient Highlanders used to assist them to climb over\r\nwalls, fixing the hook upon it and raising themselves by the handle.\r\nThe axe, which was also much used by the natives of Ireland, is\r\nsupposed to have been introduced into both countries from Scandinavia.\r\n\r\nNOTE 15\r\n\r\nAn adventure very similar to what is here stated actually befell the\r\nlate Mr. Abercromby of Tullibody, grandfather of the present Lord\r\nAbercromby, and father of the celebrated Sir Ralph. When this\r\ngentleman, who lived to a very advanced period of life, first settled\r\nin Stirlingshire, his cattle were repeatedly driven off by the\r\ncelebrated Rob Roy, or some of his gang; and at length he was obliged,\r\nafter obtaining a proper safe-conduct, to make the cateran such a visit\r\nas that of Waverley to Bean Lean in the text. Rob received him with\r\nmuch courtesy, and made many apologies for the accident, which must\r\nhave happened, he said, through some mistake. Mr. Abercromby was\r\nregaled with collops from two of his own cattle, which were hung up by\r\nthe heels in the cavern, and was dismissed in perfect safety, after\r\nhaving agreed to pay in future a small sum of black-mail, in\r\nconsideration of which Rob Roy not only undertook to forbear his herds\r\nin future, but to replace any that should be stolen from him by other\r\nfreebooters. Mr. Abercromby said Rob Roy affected to consider him as a\r\nfriend to the Jacobite interest and a sincere enemy to the Union.\r\nNeither of these circumstances were true; but the laird thought it\r\nquite unnecessary to undeceive his Highland host at the risk of\r\nbringing on a political dispute in such a situation. This anecdote I\r\nreceived many years since (about 1792) from the mouth of the venerable\r\ngentleman who was concerned in it.\r\n\r\nNOTE 16\r\n\r\nThis celebrated gibbet was, in the memory of the last generation, still\r\nstanding at the western end of the town of Crieff, in Perthshire. Why\r\nit was called the kind gallows we are unable to inform the reader with\r\ncertainty; but it is alleged that the Highlanders used to touch their\r\nbonnets as they passed a place which had been fatal to many of their\r\ncountrymen, with the ejaculation “God bless her nain sell, and the Teil\r\ntamn you!” It may therefore have been called kind, as being a sort of\r\nnative or kindred place of doom to those who suffered there, as in\r\nfulfilment of a natural destiny.\r\n\r\nNOTE 17\r\n\r\nThe story of the bridegroom carried off by caterans on his bridal-day\r\nis taken from one which was told to the author by the late Laird of\r\nMac-Nab many years since. To carry off persons from the Lowlands, and\r\nto put them to ransom, was a common practice with the wild Highlanders,\r\nas it is said to be at the present day with the banditti in the south\r\nof Italy. Upon the occasion alluded to, a party of caterans carried off\r\nthe bridegroom and secreted him in some cave near the mountain of\r\nSchiehallion. The young man caught the small-pox before his ransom\r\ncould be agreed on; and whether it was the fine cool air of the place,\r\nor the want of medical attendance, Mac-Nab did not pretend to be\r\npositive; but so it was, that the prisoner recovered, his ransom was\r\npaid, and he was restored to his friends and bride, but always\r\nconsidered the Highland robbers as having saved his life by their\r\ntreatment of his malady.\r\n\r\nNOTE 18\r\n\r\nThis happened on many occasions. Indeed, it was not till after the\r\ntotal destruction of the clan influence, after 1745, that purchasers\r\ncould be found who offered a fair price for the estates forfeited in\r\n1715, which were then brought to sale by the creditors of the York\r\nBuildings Company, who had purchased the whole, or greater part, from\r\ngovernment at a very small price. Even so late as the period first\r\nmentioned, the prejudices of the public in favour of the heirs of the\r\nforfeited families threw various impediments in the way of intending\r\npurchasers of such property.\r\n\r\nNOTE 19\r\n\r\nThis sort of political game ascribed to Mac-Ivor was in reality played\r\nby several Highland chiefs, the celebrated Lord Lovat in particular,\r\nwho used that kind of finesse to the uttermost. The Laird of Mac—— was\r\nalso captain of an independent company, but valued the sweets of\r\npresent pay too well to incur the risk of losing them in the Jacobite\r\ncause. His martial consort raised his clan and headed it in 1745. But\r\nthe chief himself would have nothing to do with king-making, declaring\r\nhimself for that monarch, and no other, who gave the Laird of Mac ——\r\n“half-a-guinea the day and half-a-guinea the morn.”\r\n\r\nNOTE 20\r\n\r\nIn explanation of the military exercise observed at the Castle of\r\nGlennaquoich, the author begs to remark that the Highlanders were not\r\nonly well practised in the use of the broadsword, firelock, and most of\r\nthe manly sports and trials of strength common throughout Scotland, but\r\nalso used a peculiar sort of drill, suited to their own dress and mode\r\nof warfare. There were, for instance, different modes of disposing the\r\nplaid, one when on a peaceful journey, another when danger was\r\napprehended; one way of enveloping themselves in it when expecting\r\nundisturbed repose, and another which enabled them to start up with\r\nsword and pistol in hand on the slightest alarm.\r\n\r\nPrevious to 1720 or thereabouts, the belted plaid was universally worn,\r\nin which the portion which surrounded the middle of the wearer and that\r\nwhich was flung around his shoulders were all of the same piece of\r\ntartan. In a desperate onset all was thrown away, and the clan charged\r\nbare beneath the doublet, save for an artificial arrangement of the\r\nshirt, which, like that of the Irish, was always ample, and for the\r\nsporran-mollach, or goat’s-skin purse.\r\n\r\nThe manner of handling the pistol and dirk was also part of the\r\nHighland manual exercise, which the author has seen gone through by men\r\nwho had learned it in their youth.\r\n\r\nNOTE 21\r\n\r\nPork or swine’s flesh, in any shape, was, till of late years, much\r\nabominated by the Scotch, nor is it yet a favourite food amongst them.\r\nKing Jamie carried this prejudice to England, and is known to have\r\nabhorred pork almost as much as he did tobacco. Ben Jonson has recorded\r\nthis peculiarity, where the gipsy in a masque, examining the king’s\r\nhand, says—\r\n\r\n    You should, by this line,\r\n    Love a horse and a hound, but no part of a swine.\r\n\r\n    _The Gipsies Metamorphosed_.\r\n\r\nJames’s own proposed banquet for the Devil was a loin of pork and a\r\npoll of ling, with a pipe of tobacco for digestion.\r\n\r\nNOTE 22\r\n\r\nIn the number of persons of all ranks who assembled at the same table,\r\nthough by no means to discuss the same fare, the Highland chiefs only\r\nretained a custom which had been formerly universally observed\r\nthroughout Scotland. “I myself,” says the traveller, Fynes Morrison, in\r\nthe end of Queen Elizabeth’s reign, the scene being the Lowlands of\r\nScotland, “was at a knight’s house, who had many servants to attend\r\nhim, that brought in his meat with their heads covered with blue caps,\r\nthe table being more than half furnished with great platters of\r\nporridge, each having a little piece of sodden meat. And when the table\r\nwas served, the servants did sit down with us; but the upper mess,\r\ninstead of porridge, had a pullet, with some prunes in the broth”\r\n(“Travels,” p. 155).\r\n\r\nTill within this last century the farmers, even of a respectable\r\ncondition, dined with their work-people. The difference betwixt those\r\nof high degree was ascertained by the place of the party above or below\r\nthe salt, or sometimes by a line drawn with chalk on the dining-table.\r\nLord Lovat, who knew well how to feed the vanity and restrain the\r\nappetites of his clansmen, allowed each sturdy Fraser who had the\r\nslightest pretensions to be a Duinhewassel the full honour of the\r\nsitting, but at the same time took care that his young kinsmen did not\r\nacquire at his table any taste for outlandish luxuries. His lordship\r\nwas always ready with some honourable apology why foreign wines and\r\nFrench brandy, delicacies which he conceived might sap the hardy habits\r\nof his cousins, should not circulate past an assigned point on the\r\ntable.\r\n\r\nNOTE 23\r\n\r\nIn the Irish ballads relating to Fion (the Fingal of Mac-Pherson) there\r\noccurs, as in the primitive poetry of most nations, a cycle of heroes,\r\neach of whom has some distinguishing attribute; upon these qualities,\r\nand the adventures of those possessing them, many proverbs are formed,\r\nwhich are still current in the Highlands. Among other characters, Conan\r\nis distinguished as in some respects a kind of Thersites, but brave and\r\ndaring even to rashness. He had made a vow that he would never take a\r\nblow without returning it; and having, like other heroes of antiquity,\r\ndescended to the infernal regions, he received a cuff from the\r\nArch-fiend who presided there, which he instantly returned, using the\r\nexpression in the text. Sometimes the proverb is worded thus—“Claw for\r\nclaw, and the devil take the shortest nails, as Conan said to the\r\ndevil.”\r\n\r\nNOTE 24\r\n\r\nThe description of the waterfall mentioned in this chapter is taken\r\nfrom that of Ledeard, at the farm so called, on the northern side of\r\nLochard, and near the head of the lake, four or five miles from\r\nAberfoyle. It is upon a small scale, but otherwise one of the most\r\nexquisite cascades it is possible to behold. The appearance of Flora\r\nwith the harp, as described, has been justly censured as too theatrical\r\nand affected for the lady-like simplicity of her character. But\r\nsomething may be allowed to her French education, in which point and\r\nstriking effect always make a considerable object.\r\n\r\nNOTE 25\r\n\r\nThe author has been sometimes accused of confounding fiction with\r\nreality. He therefore thinks it necessary to state that the\r\ncircumstance of the hunting described in the text as preparatory to the\r\ninsurrection of 1745 is, so far as he knows, entirely imaginary. But it\r\nis well known such a great hunting was held in the Forest of Brae-Mar,\r\nunder the auspices of the Earl of Mar, as preparatory to the Rebellion\r\nof 1715; and most of the Highland chieftains who afterwards engaged in\r\nthat civil commotion were present on this occasion.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nGLOSSARY—Volume I.\r\n\r\n\r\nA’, all.\r\n\r\nABOON, abune, above.\r\n\r\nABY, abye, endure, suffer.\r\n\r\nACCOLADE, the salutation marking the bestowal of knighthood.\r\n\r\nAIN, own.\r\n\r\nALANE, alone.\r\n\r\nAN, if.\r\n\r\nANE, one.\r\n\r\nARRAY, annoy, trouble.\r\n\r\nAULD, old.\r\n\r\nAWEEL, well.\r\n\r\nAYE, always.\r\n\r\nBAILIE, a city magistrate in Scotland.\r\n\r\nBAN, curse.\r\n\r\nBAWTY, sly, cunning.\r\n\r\nBAXTER, a baker.\r\n\r\nBEES, in the, stupefied, bewildered.\r\n\r\nBELIVE, belyve, by and by.\r\n\r\nBEN, in, inside.\r\n\r\nBENT, an open field.\r\n\r\nBHAIRD, a bard.\r\n\r\nBLACK-FISHING, fishing by torchlight poaching.\r\n\r\nBLINKED, glanced.\r\n\r\nBLUDE, braid, blood.\r\n\r\nBLYTHE, gay, glad.\r\n\r\nBODLE, a copper coin worth a third of an English penny.\r\n\r\nBOLE, a bowl.\r\n\r\nBOOT-KETCH, a boot-jack.\r\n\r\nBRAE, the side of a hill.\r\n\r\nBRISSEL-COCK, a turkey cock.\r\n\r\nBREEKS, breeches.\r\n\r\nBROGUES, Highland shoes.\r\n\r\nBROKEN MEN, outlaws.\r\n\r\nBROUGHT FAR BEN, held in special favor\r\n\r\nBROWST, a brewing.\r\n\r\nBRUIK, enjoy.\r\n\r\nBUCKIE, a perverse or refractory person.\r\n\r\nBULLSEGG, a gelded bull.\r\n\r\nBURD, bird, a term of familiarity.\r\n\r\nBURN, a brook.\r\n\r\nBUSKING, dress, decoration.\r\n\r\nBUTTOCK-MAIL, a fine for fornication.\r\n\r\nBYDAND, awaiting.\r\n\r\nCAILLIACHS, old women on whom devolved the duty of lamenting for the\r\ndead, which the Irish call keening.\r\n\r\nCALLANT, a young lad, a fine fellow.\r\n\r\nCANNY, prudent, skillful, lucky.\r\n\r\nCANTER, a canting, whining beggar.\r\n\r\nCANTRIP, a trick.\r\n\r\nCARLE, a churl, an old man.\r\n\r\nCATERAN, a Highland irregular soldier, a freebooter.\r\n\r\nCHAP, a customer.\r\n\r\nCLACHAN, a hamlet.\r\n\r\nCLAW FAVOUR, curry favour.\r\n\r\nCLAYMORE, a broad sword.\r\n\r\nCLEEK, a hook.\r\n\r\nCLEIK the cunzie, steal the silver.\r\n\r\nCOB, beat.\r\n\r\nCOBLE, a small fishing boat.\r\n\r\nCOGS, wooden vessels.\r\n\r\nCOGUE, a round wooden vessel.\r\n\r\nCONCUSSED, violently shaken, disturbed, forced.\r\n\r\nCORONACH, a dirge.\r\n\r\nCORRIE, a mountain hollow.\r\n\r\nCOVE, a cave.\r\n\r\nCRAME, a booth, a merchant’s shop.\r\n\r\nCREAGH, an incursion for plunder, termed on the Borders a raid.\r\n\r\nCROUSE, bold, courageous.\r\n\r\nCRUMMY, a cow with crooked horns.\r\n\r\nCUITTLE, tickle.\r\n\r\nCURRAGH, a Highland boat.\r\n\r\nDAFT, mad, foolish.\r\n\r\nDEBINDED, bound down.\r\n\r\nDECREET, an order of decree.\r\n\r\nDEOCH AN DORUIS, the stirrup-cup or parting drink.\r\n\r\nDERN, concealed, secret.\r\n\r\nDINMONTS, wethers in the second year.\r\n\r\nDOER, an agent, a manager.\r\n\r\nDOON, doun, down.\r\n\r\nDOVERING, dozing.\r\n\r\nDUINHÉ-WASSEL, dunniewassal, a Highland gentleman, usually the cadet of\r\na family of rank.\r\n\r\nEANARUICH, the regalia presented by Rob Roy to the Laird of Tullibody.\r\n\r\nENEUGH, eneuch, enough.\r\n\r\nERGASTULO, in a penitentiary.\r\n\r\nEXEEMED, exempt.\r\n\r\nFACTORY, stewardship.\r\n\r\nFEAL AND DIVOT, turf and thatch.\r\n\r\nFECK, a quantity.\r\n\r\nFEIFTEEN, the Jacobite rebellion of 1715.\r\n\r\nFENDY, good at making a shift.\r\n\r\nFIRE-RAISING, setting an incendiary fire.\r\n\r\nFLEMIT, frightened,\r\n\r\nFRAE, from.\r\n\r\nFU, full.\r\n\r\nFULE, fool.\r\n\r\nGABERLUNZIE, a kind of professional beggar.\r\n\r\nGANE, gone.\r\n\r\nGANG, go.\r\n\r\nGAR, make.\r\n\r\nGATE, gait, way.\r\n\r\nGAUN, going.\r\n\r\nGAY, gey, very.\r\n\r\nGEAR, goods, property.\r\n\r\nGILLFLIRT, a flirty girl.\r\n\r\nGILLIE, a servant, an attendant.\r\n\r\nGILLIE-WET-FOOT, a barefooted Highland lad.\r\n\r\nGIMMER, a ewe from one to two years old.\r\n\r\nGLISKED, glimpsed.\r\n\r\nGRIPPLE, rapacious, niggardly.\r\n\r\nGULPIN, a simpleton.\r\n\r\nHA’, hall.\r\n\r\nHAG, a portion of copse marked off for cutting.\r\n\r\nHAIL, whole.\r\n\r\nHALLAN, a partition, a screen.\r\n\r\nHAME, home.\r\n\r\nHANTLE, a great deal.\r\n\r\nHARST, harvest.\r\n\r\nHERSHIPS, plunder.\r\n\r\nHILDING, a coward.\r\n\r\nHIRSTS, knolls.\r\n\r\nHORNING, charge of, a summons to pay a debt, on pain of being\r\npronounced a rebel, to the sound of a horn.\r\n\r\nHOWE, a hollow.\r\n\r\nHOULERYING AND POULERYING, hustling and pulling.\r\n\r\nHURLEY-HOUSE, a brokendown manor house.\r\n\r\nILK, same;

Their celebrated pibroch of _Hoggil nam Bo_, which is\r\nthe name of their gathering tune, intimates similar practices, the\r\nsense being:—\r\n\r\nWe are bound to drive the bullocks,\r\nAll by hollows, hirsts, and hillocks,\r\n    Through the sleet, and through the rain.\r\nWhen the moon is beaming low\r\nOn frozen lake and hills of snow,\r\nBold and heartily we go;\r\n    And all for little gain.\r\n\r\n\r\nNOTE 27\r\n\r\nThis noble ruin is dear to my recollection, from associations which\r\nhave been long and painfully broken. It holds a commanding station on\r\nthe banks of the river Teith, and has been one of the largest castles\r\nin Scotland. Murdoch, Duke of Albany, the founder of this stately pile,\r\nwas beheaded on the Castle-hill of Stirling, from which he might see\r\nthe towers of Doune, the monument of his fallen greatness.\r\n\r\nIn 1745–46, as stated in the text, a garrison on the part of the\r\nChevalier was put into the castle, then less ruinous than at present.\r\nIt was commanded by Mr. Stewart of Balloch, as governor for Prince\r\nCharles; he was a man of property near Callander. This castle became at\r\nthat time the actual scene of a romantic escape made by John Home, the\r\nauthor of Douglas, and some other prisoners, who, having been taken at\r\nthe battle of Falkirk, were confined there by the insurgents. The poet,\r\nwho had in his own mind a large stock of that romantic and enthusiastic\r\nspirit of adventure which he has described as animating the youthful\r\nhero of his drama, devised and undertook the perilous enterprise of\r\nescaping from his prison. He inspired his companions with his\r\nsentiments, and when every attempt at open force was deemed hopeless,\r\nthey resolved to twist their bed-clothes into ropes and thus to\r\ndescend. Four persons, with Home himself, reached the ground in safety.\r\nBut the rope broke with the fifth, who was a tall, lusty man. The sixth\r\nwas Thomas Barrow, a brave young Englishman, a particular friend of\r\nHome’s. Determined to take the risk, even in such unfavourable\r\ncircumstances, Barrow committed himself to the broken rope, slid down\r\non it as far as it could assist him, and then let himself drop. His\r\nfriends beneath succeeded in breaking his fall. Nevertheless, he\r\ndislocated his ankle and had several of his ribs broken. His\r\ncompanions, however, were able to bear him off in safety.\r\n\r\nThe Highlanders next morning sought for their prisoners with great\r\nactivity. An old gentleman told the author he remembered seeing the\r\ncommandant Stewart\r\n\r\nBloody with spurring, fiery red with haste,\r\n\r\n\r\nriding furiously through the country in quest of the fugitives.\r\n\r\nNOTE 28\r\n\r\nTo go out, or to have been out, in Scotland was a conventional phrase\r\nsimilar to that of the Irish respecting a man having been up, both\r\nhaving reference to an individual who had been engaged in insurrection.\r\nIt was accounted ill-breeding in Scotland about forty years since to\r\nuse the phrase rebellion or rebel, which might be interpreted by some\r\nof the parties present as a personal insult. It was also esteemed more\r\npolite, even for stanch Whigs, to denominate Charles Edward the\r\nChevalier than to speak of him as the Pretender; and this kind of\r\naccommodating courtesy was usually observed in society where\r\nindividuals of each party mixed on friendly terms.\r\n\r\nNOTE 29\r\n\r\nThe Jacobite sentiments were general among the western counties and in\r\nWales. But although the great families of the Wynnes, the Wyndhams, and\r\nothers had come under an actual obligation to join Prince Charles if he\r\nshould land, they had done so under the express stipulation that he\r\nshould be assisted by an auxiliary army of French, without which they\r\nforesaw the enterprise would be desperate. Wishing well to his cause,\r\ntherefore, and watching an opportunity to join him, they did not,\r\nnevertheless, think themselves bound in honour to do so, as he was only\r\nsupported by a body of wild mountaineers, speaking an uncouth dialect,\r\nand wearing a singular dress. The race up to Derby struck them with\r\nmore dread than admiration. But it is difficult to say what the effect\r\nmight have been had either the battle of Preston or Falkirk been fought\r\nand won during the advance into England.\r\n\r\nNOTE 30\r\n\r\nDivisions early showed themselves in the Chevalier’s little army, not\r\nonly amongst the independent chieftains, who were far too proud to\r\nbrook subjection to each other, but betwixt the Scotch and Charles’s\r\ngovernor O’Sullivan, an Irishman by birth, who, with some of his\r\ncountrymen bred in the Irish Brigade in the service of the King of\r\nFrance, had an influence with the Adventurer much resented by the\r\nHighlanders, who were sensible that their own clans made the chief or\r\nrather the only strength of his enterprise. There was a feud, also,\r\nbetween Lord George Murray and John Murray of Broughton, the Prince’s\r\nsecretary, whose disunion greatly embarrassed the affairs of the\r\nAdventurer. In general, a thousand different pretensions divided their\r\nlittle army, and finally contributed in no small degree to its\r\noverthrow.\r\n\r\nNOTE 31\r\n\r\nThis circumstance, which is historical, as well as the description that\r\nprecedes it, will remind the reader of the war of La Vendée, in which\r\nthe royalists, consisting chiefly of insurgent peasantry, attached a\r\nprodigious and even superstitious interest to the possession of a piece\r\nof brass ordnance, which they called Marie Jeanne.\r\n\r\nThe Highlanders of an early period were afraid of cannon, with the\r\nnoise and effect of which they were totally unacquainted. It was by\r\nmeans of three or four small pieces of artillery that the Earls of\r\nHuntly and Errol, in James VI.’s time, gained a great victory at\r\nGlenlivat, over a numerous Highland army, commanded by the Earl of\r\nArgyle. At the battle of the Bridge of Dee, General Middleton obtained\r\nby his artillery a similar success, the Highlanders not being able to\r\nstand the discharge of Musket’s Mother, which was the name they\r\nbestowed on great guns. In an old ballad on the battle of the Bridge of\r\nDee these verses occur:—\r\n\r\n“The Highlandmen are pretty men\r\nFor handling sword and shield,\r\nBut yet they are but simple men\r\nTo stand a stricken field.\r\n\r\n“The Highlandmen are pretty men\r\nFor target and claymore,\r\nBut yet they are but naked men\r\nTo face the cannon’s roar.\r\n\r\n“For the cannons roar on a summer night\r\nLike thunder in the air;\r\nWas never man in Highland garb\r\nWould face the cannon fair.”\r\n\r\n\r\nBut the Highlanders of 1745 had got far beyond the simplicity of their\r\nforefathers, and showed throughout the whole war how little they\r\ndreaded artillery, although the common people still attached some\r\nconsequence to the possession of the field-piece which led to this\r\ndisquisition.\r\n\r\nNOTE 32\r\n\r\nThe faithful friend who pointed out the pass by which the Highlanders\r\nmoved from Tranent to Seaton was Robert Anderson, junior, of Whitburgh,\r\na gentleman of property in East Lothian. He had been interrogated by\r\nthe Lord George Murray concerning the possibility of crossing the\r\nuncouth and marshy piece of ground which divided the armies, and which\r\nhe described as impracticable. When dismissed, he recollected that\r\nthere was a circuitous path leading eastward through the marsh into the\r\nplain, by which the Highlanders might turn the flank of Sir John Cope’s\r\nposition without being exposed to the enemy’s fire. Having mentioned\r\nhis opinion to Mr. Hepburn of Keith, who instantly saw its importance,\r\nhe was encouraged by that gentleman to awake Lord George Murray and\r\ncommunicate the idea to him. Lord George received the information with\r\ngrateful thanks, and instantly awakened Prince Charles, who was\r\nsleeping in the field with a bunch of pease under his head. The\r\nAdventurer received with alacrity the news that there was a possibility\r\nof bringing an excellently provided army to a decisive battle with his\r\nown irregular forces. His joy on the occasion was not very consistent\r\nwith the charge of cowardice brought against him by Chevalier\r\nJohnstone, a discontented follower, whose Memoirs possess at least as\r\nmuch of a romantic as a historical character. Even by the account of\r\nthe Chevalier himself, the Prince was at the head of the second line of\r\nthe Highland army during the battle, of which he says, “It was gained\r\nwith such rapidity that in the second line, where I was still by the\r\nside of the Prince, we saw no other enemy than those who were lying on\r\nthe ground killed and wounded, _though we were not more than fifty\r\npaces behind our first line, running always as fast as we could to\r\novertake them_.”\r\n\r\nThis passage in the Chevalier’s Memoirs places the Prince within fifty\r\npaces of the heat of the battle, a position which would never have been\r\nthe choice of one unwilling to take a share of its dangers. Indeed,\r\nunless the chiefs had complied with the young Adventurer’s proposal to\r\nlead the van in person, it does not appear that he could have been\r\ndeeper in the action.\r\n\r\nNOTE 33\r\n\r\nThe death of this good Christian and gallant man is thus given by his\r\naffectionate biographer, Doctor Doddridge, from the evidence of\r\neye-witnesses:—\r\n\r\n“He continued all night under arms, wrapped up in his cloak, and\r\ngenerally sheltered under a rick of barley which happened to be in the\r\nfield. About three in the morning he called his domestic servants to\r\nhim, of which there were four in waiting. He dismissed three of them\r\nwith most affectionate Christian advice, and such solemn charges\r\nrelating to the performance of their duty, and the care of their souls,\r\nas seemed plainly to intimate that he apprehended it was at least very\r\nprobable he was taking his last farewell of them. There is great reason\r\nto believe that he spent the little remainder of the time, which could\r\nnot be much above an hour, in those devout exercises of soul which had\r\nbeen so long habitual to him, and to which so many circumstances did\r\nthen concur to call him. The army was alarmed by break of day by the\r\nnoise of the rebels’ approach, and the attack was made before sunrise,\r\nyet when it was light enough to discern what passed. As soon as the\r\nenemy came within gun-shot they made a furious fire; and it is said\r\nthat the dragoons which constituted the left wing immediately fled. The\r\nColonel at the beginning of the onset, which in the whole lasted but a\r\nfew minutes, received a wound by a bullet in his left breast, which\r\nmade him give a sudden spring in his saddle; upon which his servant,\r\nwho led the horse, would have persuaded him to retreat, but he said it\r\nwas only a wound in the flesh, and fought on, though he presently after\r\nreceived a shot in his right thigh. In the mean time, it was discerned\r\nthat some of the enemy fell by him, and particularly one man who had\r\nmade him a treacherous visit but a few days before, with great\r\nprofessions of zeal for the present establishment.\r\n\r\n“Events of this kind pass in less time than the description of them can\r\nbe written, or than it can be read. The Colonel was for a few moments\r\nsupported by his men, and particularly by that worthy person\r\nLieutenant-Colonel Whitney, who was shot through the arm here, and a\r\nfew months after fell nobly at the battle of Falkirk, and by Lieutenant\r\nWest, a man of distinguished bravery, as also by about fifteen\r\ndragoons, who stood by him to the last. But after a faint fire, the\r\nregiment in general was seized with a panic; and though their Colonel\r\nand some other gallant officers did what they could to rally them once\r\nor twice, they at last took a precipitate flight. And just in the\r\nmoment when Colonel Gardiner seemed to be making a pause to deliberate\r\nwhat duty required him to do in such circumstances, an accident\r\nhappened, which must, I think, in the judgment of every worthy and\r\ngenerous man, be allowed a sufficient apology for exposing his life to\r\nso great hazard, when his regiment had left him. He saw a party of the\r\nfoot, who were then bravely fighting near him, and whom he was ordered\r\nto support, had no officer to head them; upon which he said eagerly, in\r\nthe hearing of the person from whom I had this account, “These brave\r\nfellows will be cut to pieces for want of a commander,” or words to\r\nthat effect; which while he was speaking he rode up to them and cried\r\nout, “Fire on, my lads, and fear nothing.” But just as the words were\r\nout of his mouth, a Highlander advanced towards him with a scythe\r\nfastened to a long pole, with which he gave him so dreadful a wound on\r\nhis right arm, that his sword dropped out of his hand; and at the same\r\ntime several others coming about him while he was thus dreadfully\r\nentangled with that cruel weapon, he was dragged off from his horse.\r\nThe moment he fell, another Highlander, who, if the king’s evidence at\r\nCarlisle may be credited (as I know not why they should not, though the\r\nunhappy creature died denying it), was one Mac-Naught, who was executed\r\nabout a year after, gave him a stroke either with a broadsword or a\r\nLochaber-axe (for my informant could not exactly distinguish) on the\r\nhinder part of his head, which was the mortal blow. All that his\r\nfaithful attendant saw farther at this time was that, as his hat was\r\nfallen off, he took it in his left hand and waved it as a signal to him\r\nto retreat, and added, what were the last words he ever heard him\r\nspeak, “Take care of yourself”; upon which the servant retired” (_Some\r\nRemarkable Passages in the Life of Colonel James Gardiner, by P.\r\nDoddridge, D.D._ London, 1747, P.187).\r\n\r\nI may remark on this extract, that it confirms the account given in the\r\ntext of the resistance offered by some of the English infantry.\r\nSurprised by a force of a peculiar and unusual description, their\r\nopposition could not be long or formidable, especially as they were\r\ndeserted by the cavalry, and those who undertook to manage the\r\nartillery. But, although the affair was soon decided, I have always\r\nunderstood that many of the infantry showed an inclination to do their\r\nduty.\r\n\r\nNOTE 34\r\n\r\nIt is scarcely necessary to say that the character of this brutal young\r\nLaird is entirely imaginary. A gentleman, however, who resembled\r\nBalmawhapple in the article of courage only, fell at Preston in the\r\nmanner described. A Perthshire gentleman of high honour and\r\nrespectability, one of the handful of cavalry who followed the fortunes\r\nof Charles Edward, pursued the fugitive dragoons almost alone till near\r\nSaint Clement’s Wells, where the efforts of some of the officers had\r\nprevailed on a few of them to make a momentary stand. Perceiving at\r\nthis moment that they were pursued by only one man and a couple of\r\nservants, they turned upon him and cut him down with their swords. I\r\nremember when a child, sitting on his grave, where the grass long grew\r\nrank and green, distinguishing it from the rest of the field. A female\r\nof the family then residing at Saint Clement’s Wells used to tell me\r\nthe tragedy, of which she had been an eye-witness, and showed me in\r\nevidence one of the silver clasps of the unfortunate gentleman’s\r\nwaistcoat.\r\n\r\nNOTE 35\r\n\r\nThe name of Andrea de Ferrara is inscribed on all the Scottish\r\nbroadswords which are accounted of peculiar excellence. Who this artist\r\nwas, what were his fortunes, and when he flourished, have hitherto\r\ndefied the research of antiquaries; only it is in general believed that\r\nAndrea de Ferrara was a Spanish or Italian artificer, brought over by\r\nJames IV. or V. to instruct the Scots in the manufacture of sword\r\nblades. Most barbarous nations excel in the fabrication of arms; and\r\nthe Scots had attained great proficiency in forging swords so early as\r\nthe field of Pinkie; at which period the historian Patten describes\r\nthem as “all notably broad and thin, universally made to slice, and of\r\nsuch exceeding good temper that, as I never saw any so good, so I think\r\nit hard to devise better” (_Account of Somerset’s Expedition._)\r\n\r\nIt may be observed that the best and most genuine Andrea Ferraras have\r\na crown marked on the blades.\r\n\r\nNOTE 36\r\n\r\nThe incident here said to have happened to Flora Mac-Ivor actually\r\nbefell Miss Nairne, a lady with whom the author had the pleasure of\r\nbeing acquainted. As the Highland army rushed into Edinburgh, Miss\r\nNairne, like other ladies who approved of their cause, stood waving her\r\nhandkerchief from a balcony, when a ball from a Highlander’s musket,\r\nwhich was discharged by accident, grazed her forehead. “Thank God,”\r\nsaid she, the instant she recovered, “that the accident happened to me,\r\nwhose principles are known. Had it befallen a Whig, they would have\r\nsaid it was done on purpose.”\r\n\r\nNOTE 37\r\n\r\nThe Author of “Waverley” has been charged with painting the young\r\nAdventurer in colours more amiable than his character deserved. But\r\nhaving known many individuals who were near his person, he has been\r\ndescribed according to the light in which those eye-witnesses saw his\r\ntemper and qualifications. Something must be allowed, no doubt, to the\r\nnatural exaggerations of those who remembered him as the bold and\r\nadventurous Prince in whose cause they had braved death and ruin; but\r\nis their evidence to give place entirely to that of a single\r\nmalcontent?\r\n\r\nI have already noticed the imputations thrown by the Chevalier\r\nJohnstone on the Prince’s courage. But some part at least of that\r\ngentleman’s tale is purely romantic. It would not, for instance, be\r\nsupposed that at the time he is favouring us with the highly wrought\r\naccount of his amour with the adorable Peggie, the Chevalier Johnstone\r\nwas a married man, whose grandchild is now alive; or that the whole\r\ncircumstantial story concerning the outrageous vengeance taken by\r\nGordon of Abbachie on a Presbyterian clergyman is entirely apocryphal.\r\nAt the same time it may be admitted that the Prince, like others of his\r\nfamily, did not esteem the services done him by his adherents so highly\r\nas he ought. Educated in high ideas of his hereditary right, he has\r\nbeen supposed to have held every exertion and sacrifice made in his\r\ncause as too much the duty of the person making it to merit extravagant\r\ngratitude on his part. Dr. King’s evidence (which his leaving the\r\nJacobite interest renders somewhat doubtful) goes to strengthen this\r\nopinion.\r\n\r\nThe ingenious editor of Johnstone’s Memoirs has quoted a story said to\r\nbe told by Helvetius, stating that Prince Charles Edward, far from\r\nvoluntarily embarking on his daring expedition, was, literally bound\r\nhand and foot, and to which he seems disposed to yield credit. Now, it\r\nbeing a fact as well known as any in his history, and, so far as I\r\nknow, entirely undisputed, that the Prince’s personal entreaties and\r\nurgency positively forced Boisdale and Lochiel into insurrection, when\r\nthey were earnestly desirous that he would put off his attempt until he\r\ncould obtain a sufficient force from France, it will be very difficult\r\nto reconcile his alleged reluctance to undertake the expedition with\r\nhis desperately insisting upon carrying the rising into effect against\r\nthe advice and entreaty of his most powerful and most sage partizans.\r\nSurely a man who had been carried bound on board the vessel which\r\nbrought him to so desperate an enterprise would have taken the\r\nopportunity afforded by the reluctance of his partizans to return to\r\nFrance in safety.\r\n\r\nIt is averred in Johnstone’s Memoirs that Charles Edward left the field\r\nof Culloden without doing the utmost to dispute the victory; and, to\r\ngive the evidence on both sides, there is in existence the more\r\ntrustworthy testimony of Lord Elcho, who states that he himself\r\nearnestly exhorted the Prince to charge at the head of the left wing,\r\nwhich was entire, and retrieve the day or die with honour. And on his\r\ncounsel being declined, Lord Elcho took leave of him with a bitter\r\nexecration, swearing he would never look on his face again, and kept\r\nhis word.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, it seems to have been the opinion of almost all the\r\nother officers that the day was irretrievably lost, one wing of the\r\nHighlanders being entirely routed, the rest of the army outnumbered,\r\noutflanked, and in a condition totally hopeless. In this situation of\r\nthings the Irish officers who surrounded Charles’s person interfered to\r\nforce him off the field. A cornet who was close to the Prince left a\r\nstrong attestation that he had seen Sir Thomas Sheridan seize the\r\nbridle of his horse and turn him round. There is some discrepancy of\r\nevidence; but the opinion of Lord Elcho, a man of fiery temper and\r\ndesperate at the ruin which he beheld impending, cannot fairly be taken\r\nin prejudice of a character for courage which is intimated by the\r\nnature of the enterprise itself, by the Prince’s eagerness to fight on\r\nall occasions, by his determination to advance from Derby to London,\r\nand by the presence of mind which he manifested during the romantic\r\nperils of his escape. The author is far from claiming for this\r\nunfortunate person the praise due to splendid talents; but he continues\r\nto be of opinion that at the period of his enterprise he had a mind\r\ncapable of facing danger and aspiring to fame.\r\n\r\nThat Charles Edward had the advantages of a graceful presence,\r\ncourtesy, and an address and manner becoming his station, the author\r\nnever heard disputed by any who approached his person, nor does he\r\nconceive that these qualities are overcharged in the present attempt to\r\nsketch his portrait.\r\n\r\nThe following extracts corroborative of the general opinion respecting\r\nthe Prince’s amiable disposition are taken from a manuscript account of\r\nhis romantic expedition, by James Maxwell of Kirkconnell, of which I\r\npossess a copy, by the friendship of J. Menzies, Esq., of Pitfoddells.\r\nThe author, though partial to the Prince, whom he faithfully followed,\r\nseems to have been a fair and candid man, and well acquainted with the\r\nintrigues among the adventurer’s council:—\r\n\r\n“Everybody was mightily taken with the Prince’s figure and personal\r\nbehaviour. There was but one voice about them. Those whom interest or\r\nprejudice made a runaway to his cause could not help acknowledging that\r\nthey wished him well in all other respects, and could hardly blame him\r\nfor his present undertaking. Sundry things had concurred to raise his\r\ncharacter to the highest pitch, besides the greatness of the enterprise\r\nand the conduct that had hitherto appeared in the execution of it.\r\n\r\n“There were several instances of good nature and humanity that had made\r\na great impression on people’s minds. I shall confine myself to two or\r\nthree.\r\n\r\n“Immediately after the battle, as the Prince was riding along the\r\nground that Cope’s army had occupied a few minutes before, one of the\r\nofficers came up to congratulate him, and said, pointing to the killed,\r\n“Sir, there are your enemies at your feet.” The Prince, far from\r\nexulting, expressed a great deal of compassion for his father’s deluded\r\nsubjects, whom he declared he was heartily sorry to see in that\r\nposture.\r\n\r\n“Next day, while the Prince was at Pinkie House, a citizen of Edinburgh\r\ncame to make some representation to Secretary Murray about the tents\r\nthat city was ordered to furnish against a certain day. Murray happened\r\nto be out of the way, which the Prince hearing of called to have the\r\ngentleman brought to him, saying, he would rather despatch the\r\nbusiness, whatever it was, himself than have the gentleman wait, which\r\nhe did, by granting everything that was asked. So much affability in a\r\nyoung prince flushed with victory drew encomiums even from his enemies.\r\n\r\n“But what gave the people the highest idea of him was the negative he\r\ngave to a thing that very nearly concerned his interest, and upon which\r\nthe success of his enterprise perhaps depended. It was proposed to send\r\none of the prisoners to London to demand of that court a cartel for the\r\nexchange of prisoners taken, and to be taken, during this war, and to\r\nintimate that a refusal would be looked upon as a resolution on their\r\npart to give no quarter. It was visible a cartel would be of great\r\nadvantage to the Prince’s affairs; his friends would be more ready to\r\ndeclare for him if they had nothing to fear but the chance of war in\r\nthe field; and if the court of London refused to settle a cartel, the\r\nPrince was authorised to treat his prisoners in the same manner the\r\nElector of Hanover was determined to treat such of the Prince’s friends\r\nas might fall into his hands; it was urged that a few examples would\r\ncompel the court of London to comply. It was to be presumed that the\r\nofficers of the English army would make a point of it. They had never\r\nengaged in the service but upon such terms as are in use among all\r\ncivilised nations, and it could be no stain upon their honour to lay\r\ndown their commissions if these terms were not observed, and that owing\r\nto the obstinacy of their own Prince. Though this scheme was plausible,\r\nand represented as very important, the Prince could never be brought\r\ninto it, it was below him, he said, to make empty threats, and he would\r\nnever put such as those into execution; he would never in cold blood\r\ntake away lives which he had saved in heat of action at the peril of\r\nhis own. These were not the only proofs of good nature the Prince gave\r\nabout this time. Every day produced something new of this kind. These\r\nthings softened the rigour of a military government which was only\r\nimputed to the necessity of his affairs, and which he endeavoured to\r\nmake as gentle and easy as possible.”\r\n\r\nIt has been said that the Prince sometimes exacted more state and\r\nceremonial than seemed to suit his condition; but, on the other hand,\r\nsome strictness of etiquette was altogether indispensable where he must\r\notherwise have been exposed to general intrusion. He could also endure,\r\nwith a good grace, the retorts which his affectation of ceremony\r\nsometimes exposed him to. It is said, for example, that Grant of\r\nGlenmoriston having made a hasty march to join Charles, at the head of\r\nhis clan, rushed into the Prince’s presence at Holyrood with\r\nunceremonious haste, without having attended to the duties of the\r\ntoilet. The Prince received him kindly, but not without a hint that a\r\nprevious interview with the barber might not have been wholly\r\nunnecessary. “It is not beardless boys,” answered the displeased Chief,\r\n“who are to do your Royal Highness’s turn.” The Chevalier took the\r\nrebuke in good part.\r\n\r\nOn the whole, if Prince Charles had concluded his life soon after his\r\nmiraculous escape, his character in history must have stood very high.\r\nAs it was, his station is amongst those a certain brilliant portion of\r\nwhose life forms a remarkable contrast to all which precedes and all\r\nwhich follows it.\r\n\r\nNOTE 38\r\n\r\nThe following account of the skirmish at Clifton is extracted from the\r\nmanuscript Memoirs of Evan Macpherson of Cluny, Chief of the clan\r\nMacpherson, who had the merit of supporting the principal brunt of that\r\nspirited affair. The Memoirs appear to have been composed about 1755,\r\nonly ten years after the action had taken place. They were written in\r\nFrance, where that gallant chief resided in exile, which accounts for\r\nsome Gallicisms which occur in the narrative.\r\n\r\n“In the Prince’s return from Derby back towards Scotland, my Lord\r\nGeorge Murray, Lieutenant-General, cheerfully charg’d himself with the\r\ncommand of the rear, a post which, altho’ honourable, was attended with\r\ngreat danger, many difficulties, and no small fatigue; for the Prince,\r\nbeing apprehensive that his retreat to Scotland might be cut off by\r\nMarischall Wade, who lay to the northward of him with an armie much\r\nsuperior to what H.R.H. had, while the Duke of Comberland with his\r\nwhole cavalrie followed hard in the rear, was obliged to hasten his\r\nmarches. It was not, therefore, possible for the artilirie to march so\r\nfast as the Prince’s army, in the depth of winter, extremely bad\r\nweather, and the worst roads in England; so Lord George Murray was\r\nobliged often to continue his marches long after it was dark almost\r\nevery night, while at the same time he had frequent alarms and\r\ndisturbances from the Duke of Comberland’s advanc’d parties.\r\n\r\n“Towards the evening of the twentie-eight December 1745 the Prince\r\nentered the town of Penrith, in the Province of Comberland. But as Lord\r\nGeorge Murray could not bring up the artilirie so fast as he wou’d have\r\nwish’d, he was oblig’d to pass the night six miles short of that town,\r\ntogether with the regiment of MacDonel of Glengarrie, which that day\r\nhappened to have the arrear guard. The Prince, in order to refresh his\r\narmie, and to give My Lord George and the artilirie time to come up,\r\nresolved to sejour the 29th at Penrith; so ordered his little army to\r\nappear in the morning under arms, in order to be reviewed, and to know\r\nin what manner the numbers stood from his haveing entered England. It\r\ndid not at that time amount to 5000 foot in all, with about 400\r\ncavalrie, compos’d of the noblesse who serv’d as volunteers, part of\r\nwhom form’d a first troop of guards for the Prince, under the command\r\nof My Lord Elchoe, now Comte de Weems, who, being proscribed, is\r\npresently in France. Another part formed a second troup of guards under\r\nthe command of My Lord Balmirino, who was beheaded at the Tower of\r\nLondon. A third part serv’d under My Lord le Comte de Kilmarnock, who\r\nwas likewise beheaded at the Tower. A fourth part serv’d under My Lord\r\nPitsligow, who is also proscribed; which cavalrie, tho’ very few in\r\nnumbers, being all noblesse, were very brave, and of infinite advantage\r\nto the foot, not only in the day of battle, but in serving as advanced\r\nguards on the several marches, and in patroling dureing the night on\r\nthe different roads which led towards the towns where the army happened\r\nto quarter.\r\n\r\n“While this small army was out in a body on the 20th December, upon a\r\nriseing ground to the northward of Penrith, passing review, Mons. de\r\nCluny, with his tribe, was ordered to the Bridge of Clifton, about a\r\nmile to southward of Penrith, after having pass’d in review before\r\nMons. Pattullo, who was charged with the inspection of the troops, and\r\nwas likeways Quarter-Master-General of the army, and is now in France.\r\nThey remained under arms at the bridge, waiting the arrival of My Lord\r\nGeorge Murray with the artilirie, whom Mons. de Cluny had orders to\r\ncover in passing the bridge. They arrived about sunset closly pursued\r\nby the Duke of Comberland with the whole body of his cavalrie, reckoned\r\nupwards of 3000 strong, about a thousand of whom, as near as might be\r\ncomputed, dismounted, in order to cut off the passage of the artilirie\r\ntowards the bridge, while the Duke and the others remained on horseback\r\nin order to attack the rear.\r\n\r\n“My Lord George Murray advanced, and although he found Mons. de Cluny\r\nand his tribe in good spirits under arms, yet the circumstance appear’d\r\nextremely delicate. The numbers were vastly unequall, and the attack\r\nseem’d very dangerous; so My Lord George declin’d giving orders to such\r\ntime as he ask’d Mons. de Cluny’s opinion. “I will attack them with all\r\nmy heart,” says Mons. de Cluny, “if you order me.” “I do order it\r\nthen,” answered My Lord George, and immediately went on himself along\r\nwith Mons. de Cluny, and fought sword in hand on foot at the head of\r\nthe single tribe of Macphersons. They in a moment made their way\r\nthrough a strong hedge of thorns, under the cover whereof the cavalrie\r\nhad taken their station, in the struggle of passing which hedge My Lord\r\nGeorge Murray, being dressed en montagnard, as all the army were, lost\r\nhis bonet and wig; so continued to fight bare-headed during the action.\r\nThey at first made a brisk discharge of their firearms on the enemy,\r\nthen attacked them with their sabres, and made a great slaughter a\r\nconsiderable time, which obliged Comberland and his cavalrie to fly\r\nwith precipitation and in great confusion; in so much that, if the\r\nPrince had been provided in a sufficient number of cavalrie to have\r\ntaken advantage of the disorder, it is beyond question that the Duke of\r\nComberland and the bulk of his cavalrie had been taken prisoners.\r\n\r\n“By this time it was so dark that it was not possible to view or number\r\nthe slain who filled all the ditches which happened to be on the ground\r\nwhere they stood. But it was computed that, besides those who went off\r\nwounded, upwards of a hundred at least were left on the spot, among\r\nwhom was Colonel Honywood, who commanded the dismounted cavalrie, whose\r\nsabre of considerable value Mons. de Cluny brought off and still\r\npreserves; and his tribe lykeways brought off many arms;—the Colonel\r\nwas afterwards taken up, and, his wounds being dress’d, with great\r\ndifficultie recovered. Mons. de Cluny lost only in the action twelve\r\nmen, of whom some haveing been only wounded, fell afterwards into the\r\nhands of the enemy, and were sent as slaves to America, whence several\r\nof them returned, and one of them is now in France, a sergeant in the\r\nRegiment of Royal Scots. How soon the accounts of the enemies approach\r\nhad reached the Prince, H.R.H. had immediately ordered Mi-Lord le Comte\r\nde Nairne, Brigadier, who, being proscribed, is now in France, with the\r\nthree batalions of the Duke of Athol, the batalion of the Duke of\r\nPerth, and some other troups under his command, in order to support\r\nCluny, and to bring off the artilirie. But the action was entirely over\r\nbefore the Comte de Nairne, with his command, cou’d reach nigh to the\r\nplace. They therefore return’d all to Penrith, and the artilirie\r\nmarched up in good order.\r\n\r\n“Nor did the Duke of Comberland ever afterwards dare to come within a\r\nday’s march of the Prince and his army dureing the course of all that\r\nretreat, which was conducted with great prudence and safety when in\r\nsome manner surrounded by enemies.”\r\n\r\nNOTE 39\r\n\r\nAs the heathen deities contracted an indelible obligation if they swore\r\nby Styx, the Scottish Highlanders had usually some peculiar solemnity\r\nattached to an oath which they intended should be binding on them. Very\r\nfrequently it consisted in laying their hand, as they swore, on their\r\nown drawn dirk; which dagger, becoming a party to the transaction, was\r\ninvoked to punish any breach of faith. But by whatever ritual the oath\r\nwas sanctioned, the party was extremely desirous to keep secret what\r\nthe especial oath was which he considered as irrevocable. This was a\r\nmatter of great convenience, as he felt no scruple in breaking his\r\nasseveration when made in any other form than that which he accounted\r\nas peculiarly solemn; and therefore readily granted any engagement\r\nwhich bound him no longer than he inclined. Whereas, if the oath which\r\nhe accounted inviolable was once publicly known, no party with whom he\r\nmight have occasion to contract would have rested satisfied with any\r\nother.\r\n\r\nLouis XI. of France practised the same sophistry, for he also had a\r\npeculiar species of oath, the only one which he was ever known to\r\nrespect, and which, therefore, he was very unwilling to pledge. The\r\nonly engagement which that wily tyrant accounted binding upon him was\r\nan oath by the Holy Cross of Saint Lo d’Angers, which contained a\r\nportion of the True Cross. If he prevaricated after taking this oath\r\nLouis believed he should die within the year. The Constable Saint Paul,\r\nbeing invited to a personal conference with Louis, refused to meet the\r\nking unless he would agree to ensure him safe conduct under sanction of\r\nthis oath. But, says Comines, the king replied, he would never again\r\npledge that engagement to mortal man, though he was willing to take any\r\nother oath which could be devised. The treaty broke oft, therefore,\r\nafter much chaffering concerning the nature of the vow which Louis was\r\nto take. Such is the difference between the dictates of superstition\r\nand those of conscience.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nGLOSSARY—Volume II.\r\n\r\n\r\nA’, all.\r\n\r\nABOON, abune, above.\r\n\r\nAE, one.\r\n\r\nAFF, off.\r\n\r\nAFORE, before.\r\n\r\nAHINT, behind.\r\n\r\nAIN, own.\r\n\r\nAITS, oats.\r\n\r\nAMAIST, almost.\r\n\r\nAMBRY, a cupboard, a pantry.\r\n\r\nAN, if.\r\n\r\nANE, one.\r\n\r\nANEUCH, enough.\r\n\r\nARRAY, annoy, trouble.\r\n\r\nASSOILZIED, absolved, acquitted.\r\n\r\nASSYTHMENT, satisfaction,\r\n\r\nAULD, old.\r\n\r\nBAFF, a blow.\r\n\r\nBAGGANET, a bayonet.\r\n\r\nBAILIE, a city magistrate in Scotland.\r\n\r\nBAIRN, a child.\r\n\r\nBAITH, both.\r\n\r\nBANES, bones.\r\n\r\nBANG-UP, get up quickly, bounce.\r\n\r\nBARLEY, a parley, a truce.\r\n\r\nBAULD, bold.\r\n\r\nBAULDER, bolder.\r\n\r\nBAWBEE, a halfpenny.\r\n\r\nBAWTY, sly, cunning.\r\n\r\nBEES, in the, bewildered, stupefied.\r\n\r\nBEFLUMM’D, flattered, cajoled.\r\n\r\nBEGUNK, a trick, a cheat.\r\n\r\nBEN, within, inside.\r\n\r\nBENEMPT, named.\r\n\r\nBICKER, a wooden dish.\r\n\r\nBIDE, stay, endure.\r\n\r\nBIELDY, affording shelter.\r\n\r\nBIGGING, building.\r\n\r\nBIRLIEMAN, a peace officer.\r\n\r\nBLACK-COCK, the black grouse.\r\n\r\nBLACK-FISHING, ashing by torchlight, poaching.\r\n\r\nBLUDE, bluid, blood.\r\n\r\nBODDLE, bodle, a copper coin, worth one third of an English penny.\r\n\r\nBOGLE ABOUT THE BUSH, beat about the bush, a children’s game.\r\n\r\nBONNIE, beautiful, comely, fine,\r\n\r\nBOUNE, prepared.\r\n\r\nBRA’, fine, handsome, showy.\r\n\r\nBRANDER, broil.\r\n\r\nBREEKS, breeches.\r\n\r\nBRENT, smooth, unwrinkled.\r\n\r\nBROGUES, Highland shoes.\r\n\r\nBROO, brew, broth.\r\n\r\nBRUCKLE, brittle, infirm.\r\n\r\nBRUIK, enjoy.\r\n\r\nBRULZIE, bruilzie, a broil, a fray.\r\n\r\nBUCKIE, a perverse or refractory person.\r\n\r\nBUTTOCK-MAIL, a fine for fornication.\r\n\r\nBYDAND, awaiting.\r\n\r\nCA’, call.\r\n\r\nCADGER, a country carrier.\r\n\r\nCAILLIACHS, old women on whom devolved the duty of lamenting for the\r\ndead, which the Irish call keening.\r\n\r\nCALLANT, a stripling, a fine fellow.\r\n\r\nCANNILY, prudently.\r\n\r\nCANNY, cautious, lucky.\r\n\r\nCARLE, a churl, an old man.\r\n\r\nCATERAN, a freebooter.\r\n\r\nCHIEL, a young man.\r\n\r\nCLACHAN, a village, a hamlet.\r\n\r\nCLAMYHEWIT, a blow, a drubbing.\r\n\r\nCLASH, chatter, gossip.\r\n\r\nCLATTER, tattle, noisy talk.\r\n\r\nCLOSE, a narrow passage.\r\n\r\nCLOUR, a bump, a bruise.\r\n\r\nCOCKY-LEEKY, a soup made of a cock, seasoned with leeks.\r\n\r\nCOGHLING AND DROGHLING, wheezing and blowing.\r\n\r\nCORONACH, a dirge.\r\n\r\nCORRIE, a mountain hollow.\r\n\r\nCOUP, fall.\r\n\r\nCOW YER CRACKS, cut short your talk, hold your tongues.\r\n\r\nCRACK, boast.\r\n\r\nCRAIG, the neck, the throat.\r\n\r\nCRAMES, merchants’ shops, booths.\r\n\r\nCUT-LUGGED, crop-eared.\r\n\r\nDAFT, foolish, mad, crazy.\r\n\r\nDAUR, dare.\r\n\r\nDEAVING, deafening.\r\n\r\nDECREET, an order of decree.\r\n\r\nDELIVER, light, agile.\r\n\r\nDERN, hidden, concealed, secret.\r\n\r\nDING, knock, beat, surpass.\r\n\r\nDINGLE, dinnle, tingle, vibrate with sound.\r\n\r\nDOER, an agent, a manager.\r\n\r\nDOG-HEAD, the hammer of a gun.\r\n\r\nDOILED, crazed, silly.\r\n\r\nDOITED, having the faculties impaired.\r\n\r\nDORLACH, a bundle.\r\n\r\nDOW, a dove.\r\n\r\nDOWF, dowff, dull, spiritless.\r\n\r\nDRAPPIE, a little drop, a small quantity of drink.\r\n\r\nEFFEIR, what is becoming.\r\n\r\nENEUGH, enough.\r\n\r\nETTER-CAP, a spider, an ill-natured person.\r\n\r\nEVITE, avoid, escape.\r\n\r\nEWEST, ewast, contiguous.\r\n\r\nFALLOW, a fellow.\r\n\r\nFAULD, fold.\r\n\r\nFEARED, afraid.\r\n\r\nFECK, a quantity.\r\n\r\nFLEYT, frightened, shy.\r\n\r\nFRAE, from.\r\n\r\nGAD, a goad, a rod.\r\n\r\nGANE, gone;
