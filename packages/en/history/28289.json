Her\r\ntranslation of Spinoza’s “Ethics” was finished the same year, but remains\r\nunpublished.  She was associate editor of _The Westminster Review_ from\r\n1851 to 1853.  She was about twenty-seven years of age when her first\r\ntranslation appeared, thirty-three when the first of these magazine\r\narticles appeared, thirty-eight at the publication of her first story,\r\nand fifty-nine when she finished “Theophrastus Such.”  Two years after\r\nshe died, at the age of sixty-one.  So that George Eliot’s literary life\r\ncovered a period of about thirty-two years.\r\n\r\nThe introductory chapter on her “Analysis of Motives” first appeared as a\r\nmagazine article, and appears here at the request of the publishers,\r\nafter having been carefully revised, indeed almost entirely rewritten by\r\nits author.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n“GEORGE ELIOT’S” ANALYSIS OF MOTIVES.\r\n\r\n\r\nGeorge Eliot is the greatest of the novelists in the delineation of\r\nfeeling and the analysis of motives.  In “uncovering certain human lots,\r\nand seeing how they are woven and interwoven,” some marvellous work has\r\nbeen done by this master in the two arts of rhetoric and fiction.\r\n\r\nIf you say the telling of a story is her forte, you put her below Wilkie\r\nCollins or Mrs. Oliphant; if you say her object is to give a picture of\r\nEnglish society, she is surpassed by Bulwer and Trollope; if she be\r\ncalled a satirist of society, Thackeray is her superior; if she intends\r\nto illustrate the absurdity of behavior, she is eclipsed by Dickens; but\r\nif the analysis of human motives be her forte and art, she stands first,\r\nand it is very doubtful whether any artist in fiction is entitled to\r\nstand second.  She reaches clear in and touches the most secret and the\r\nmost delicate spring of human action.  She has done this so well, so\r\napart from the doing of everything else, and so, in spite of doing some\r\nother things indifferently, that she works on a line quite her own, and\r\nquite alone, as a creative artist in fiction.  Others have done this\r\nincidentally and occasionally, as Charlotte Brontë and Walter Scott, but\r\nGeorge Eliot does it elaborately, with laborious painstaking, with\r\npurpose aforethought.  Scott said of Richardson: “In his survey of the\r\nheart he left neither head, bay, nor inlet behind him until he had traced\r\nits soundings, and laid it down in his chart with all its minute\r\nsinuosities, its depths and its shallows.”\r\n\r\nThis is too much to say of Richardson, but it is not too much to say of\r\nGeorge Eliot.  She has sounded depths and explored sinuosities of the\r\nhuman heart which were utterly unknown to the author of “Clarissa\r\nHarlowe.”  It is like looking into the translucent brook—you see the\r\nwriggling tad, the darting minnow, the leisurely trout, the motionless\r\npike, while in the bays and inlets you see the infusoria and animalculæ\r\nas well.\r\n\r\nGeorge Eliot belongs to and is the greatest of the school of artists in\r\nfiction who write fiction as a means to an end, instead of as an end.\r\nAnd, while she certainly is not a story-teller of the first order,\r\nconsidered simply as a story-teller, her novels are a striking\r\nillustration of the power of fiction as a means to an end.  They remind\r\nus, as few other stories do, of the fact that however inferior the story\r\nmay be considered simply as a story, it is indispensable to the\r\ndelineation of character.  No other form of composition, no discourse, or\r\nessay, or series of independent sketches, however successful, could\r\nsucceed in bringing out character equal to the novel.  Herein is at once\r\nthe justification of the power of fiction.  “He spake a parable,” with an\r\n“end” in view which could not be so expeditiously attained by any other\r\nform of address.\r\n\r\nA story of the first-class, with the story as end in itself, and a story\r\nof the first class told as a means to an end, has never been, and it is\r\nnot likely ever will be, found together.  The novel with a purpose is\r\nfatal to the novel written simply to excite by a plot, or divert by\r\npictures of scenery, or entertain as a mere panorama of social life.  So\r\nintense is George Eliot’s desire to dissect the human heart and discover\r\nits motives, that plot, diction, situations, and even consistency in the\r\nvocabulary of the characters, are all made subservient to it.  With her\r\nit is not so much that the characters do thus and so, but why they do\r\nthus and so.  Dickens portrays the behavior, George Eliot dissects the\r\nmotive of the behavior.  Here comes the human creature, says Dickens, now\r\nlet us see how he will behave.  Here comes the human creature, says\r\nGeorge Eliot, now let us see why he behaves.\r\n\r\n“Suppose,” she says, “suppose we turn from outside estimates of a man, to\r\nwonder with keener interest what is the report of his own consciousness\r\nabout his doings, with what hindrances he is carrying on his daily\r\nlabors, and with what spirit he wrestles against universal pressure,\r\nwhich may one day be too heavy for him and bring his heart to a final\r\npause.”  The outside estimate is the work of Dickens and Thackeray, the\r\ninside estimate is the work of George Eliot.\r\n\r\nObserve in the opening pages of the great novel of “Middlemarch” how soon\r\nwe pass from the outside dress to the inside reasons for it, from the\r\ncostume to the motives which control it and color it.  It was “only to\r\nclose observers that Celia’s dress differed from her sister’s,” and had\r\n“a shade of coquetry in its arrangements.”  Dorothea’s “plain dressing\r\nwas due to mixed conditions, in most of which her sister shared.”  They\r\nwere both influenced by “the pride of being ladies,” of belonging to a\r\nstock not exactly aristocratic, but unquestionably “good.”  The very\r\nquotation of the word good is significant and suggestive.  There were “no\r\nparcel-tying forefathers” in the Brooke pedigree.  A Puritan forefather,\r\n“who served under Cromwell, but afterward conformed and managed to come\r\nout of all political troubles as the proprietor of a respectable family\r\nestate,” had a hand in Dorothea’s “plain” wardrobe.  “She could not\r\nreconcile the anxieties of a spiritual life involving eternal\r\nconsequences with a keen interest in gimp and artificial protrusions of\r\ndrapery,” but Celia “had that common-sense which is able to accept\r\nmomentous doctrines without any eccentric agitation.”  Both were examples\r\nof “reversion.”  Then, as an instance of heredity working itself out in\r\ncharacter “in Mr. Brooke, the hereditary strain of Puritan energy was\r\nclearly in abeyance, but in his niece Dorothea it glowed alike through\r\nfaults and virtues.”\r\n\r\nCould anything be more natural than for a woman with this passion for,\r\nand skill in, “unravelling certain human lots,” to lay herself out upon\r\nthe human lot of woman, with all her “passionate patience of genius?”\r\nOne would say this was inevitable.  And, for a delineation of what that\r\nlot of woman really is, as made for her, there is nothing in all\r\nliterature equal to what we find in “Middlemarch,” “Romola,” “Daniel\r\nDeronda,” and “Janet’s Repentance.”  “She was a woman, and could not make\r\nher own lot.”  Never before, indeed, was so much got out of the word\r\n“lot.”  Never was that little word so hard worked, or well worked.  “We\r\nwomen,” says Gwendolen Harleth, “must stay where we grow, or where the\r\ngardeners like to transplant us.  We are brought up like the flowers, to\r\nlook as pretty as we can, and be dull without complaining.  That is my\r\nnotion about the plants, and that is the reason why some of them have got\r\npoisonous.”  To appreciate the work that George Eliot has done you must\r\nread her with the determination of finding out the reason why Gwendolen\r\nHarleth “became poisonous,” and Dorothea, with all her brains and\r\n“plans,” a failure; why “the many Theresas find for themselves no epic\r\nlife, only a life of mistakes, the offspring of a certain spiritual\r\ngrandeur ill-matched with the meanness of opportunity.”  You must search\r\nthese marvellous studies in motives for the key to the blunders of “the\r\nblundering lives” of woman which “some have felt are due to the\r\ninconvenient indefiniteness with which the Supreme power has fashioned\r\nthe natures of women.”  But as there is not “one level of feminine\r\nincompetence as strict as the ability to count three and no more, the\r\nsocial lot of woman cannot be treated with scientific certitude.”  It is\r\ntreated with a dissective delineation in the women of George Eliot\r\nunequalled in the pages of fiction.\r\n\r\nAnd then woman’s lot, as respects her “social promotion” in matrimony, so\r\nmuch sought, and so necessary for her to seek, even in spite of her\r\nconscience, and at the expense of her happiness—the unravelling of that\r\nlot would also come very natural to this expert unraveller.  And never\r\nhave we had the causes of woman’s “blunders” in match-making, and man’s\r\nblunders in love-making, told with such analytic acumen, or with such\r\npathetic and sarcastic eloquence.  It is not far from the question of\r\nwoman’s social lot to the question of questions of human life, the\r\nquestion which has so tremendous an influence upon the fortunes of\r\nmankind and womankind, the question which it is so easy for one party to\r\n“pop” and so difficult for the other party to answer intelligently or\r\nsagaciously.\r\n\r\nWhy does the young man fall in love with the young woman who is most\r\nunfit for him of all the young women of his acquaintance, and why does\r\nthe young woman accept the young man, or the old man, who is better\r\nadapted to making her life unendurable than any other man of her circle\r\nof acquaintances?  Why does the stalwart Adam Bede fall in love with\r\nHetty Sorrel, “who had nothing more than her beauty to recommend her?”\r\nThe delineator of his motives “respects him none the less.”  She thinks\r\nthat “the deep love he had for that sweet, rounded, dark-eyed Hetty, of\r\nwhose inward self he was really very ignorant, came out of the very\r\nstrength of his nature, and not out of any inconsistent weakness.  Is it\r\nany weakness, pray, to be wrought upon by exquisite music?  To feel its\r\nwondrous harmonies searching the subtlest windings of your soul, the\r\ndelicate fibres of life which no memory can penetrate, and binding\r\ntogether your whole being, past and present, in one unspeakable\r\nvibration?  If not, then neither is it a weakness to be so wrought upon\r\nby the exquisite curves of a woman’s cheek, and neck, and arms; by the\r\nliquid depth of her beseeching eyes, or the sweet girlish pout of her\r\nlips.  For the beauty of a lovely woman is like music—what can one say\r\nmore?”  And so “the noblest nature is often blinded to the character of\r\nthe woman’s soul that beauty clothes.”  Hence “the tragedy of human life\r\nis likely to continue for a long time to come, in spite of mental\r\nphilosophers who are ready with the best receipts for avoiding all\r\nmistakes of the kind.”\r\n\r\nHow simple the motive of the Rev. Edward Casaubon in popping the question\r\nto Dorothea Brooke, how complex her motives in answering the question!\r\nHe wanted an amanuensis to “love, honor, and obey” him.  She wanted a\r\nhusband who would be “a sort of father, and could teach you even Hebrew\r\nif you wished it.”  The matrimonial motives are worked to draw out the\r\ncharacter of Dorothea, and nowhere does the method of George Eliot show\r\nto greater advantage than in probing the motives of this fine, strong,\r\nconscientious, blundering young woman, whose voice “was like the voice of\r\na soul that once lived in an Æolian harp.”  She had a theoretic cast of\r\nmind.  She was “enamored of intensity and greatness, and rash in\r\nembracing what seemed to her to have those aspects.”  The awful divine\r\nhad those aspects, and she embraced him.  “Certainly such elements in the\r\ncharacter of a marriageable girl tended to interfere with her lot, and\r\nhinder it from being decided, according to custom, by good looks, vanity,\r\nand merely canine affection.”  That’s a George Eliot stroke.  If the\r\nreader does not see from that what she is driving at he may as well\r\nabandon all hope of ever appreciating her great forte and art.\r\nDorothea’s goodness and sincerity did not save her from the worst blunder\r\nthat a woman can make, while her conscientiousness only made it\r\ninevitable.  “With all her eagerness to know the truths of life she\r\nretained very childlike ideas about marriage.”  A little of the goose as\r\nwell as the child in her conscientious simplicity, perhaps.  She “felt\r\nsure she would have accepted the judicious Hooker if she had been born in\r\ntime to save him from that wretched mistake he made in matrimony, or John\r\nMilton, when his blindness had come on, or any other great man whose odd\r\nhabits it would be glorious piety to endure.”\r\n\r\nTrue to life, our author furnishes the “great man,” and the “odd habits,”\r\nand the miserable years of “glorious” endurance.  “Dorothea looked deep\r\ninto the ungauged reservoir of Mr. Casaubon’s mind, seeing reflected\r\nthere every quality she herself brought.”  They exchanged experiences—he\r\nhis desire to have an amanuensis, and she hers, to be one.  He told her\r\nin the billy-cooing of their courtship that “his notes made a formidable\r\nrange of volumes, but the crowning task would be to condense these\r\nvoluminous, still accumulating results, and bring them, like the earlier\r\nvintage of Hippocratic books, to fit a little shelf.”  Dorothea was\r\naltogether captivated by the wide embrace of this conception.  Here was\r\nsomething beyond the shallows of ladies’ school literature.  Here was a\r\nmodern Augustine who united the glories of doctor and saint.  Dorothea\r\nsaid to herself: “His feeling, his experience, what a lake compared to my\r\nlittle pool!”  The little pool runs into the great reservoir.\r\n\r\nWill you take this reservoir to be your husband, and will you promise to\r\nbe unto him a fetcher of slippers, a dotter of I’s and crosser of T’s and\r\na copier and condenser of manuscripts; until death doth you part?  I\r\nwill.\r\n\r\nThey spend their honeymoon in Rome, and on page 211 of Vol. I. we find\r\npoor Dorothea “alone in her apartments, sobbing bitterly, with such an\r\nabandonment to this relief of an oppressed heart as a woman habitually\r\ncontrolled by pride will sometimes allow herself when she feels securely\r\nalone.”  What was she crying about?  “She thought her feeling of\r\ndesolation was the fault of her own spiritual poverty.”  A characteristic\r\nGeorge Eliot probe.  Why does not Dorothea give the real reason for her\r\ndesolateness?  Because she does not know what the real reason\r\nis—conscience makes blunderers of us all.  “How was it that in the weeks\r\nsince their marriage Dorothea had not distinctly observed, but felt, with\r\na stifling depression, that the large vistas and wide fresh air which she\r\nhad dreamed of finding in her husband’s mind were replaced by anterooms\r\nand winding passages which seemed to lead no whither?  I suppose it was\r\nbecause in courtship everything is regarded as provisional and\r\npreliminary, and the smallest sample of virtue or accomplishment is taken\r\nto guarantee delightful stores which the broad leisure of marriage will\r\nreveal.  But, the door-sill of marriage once crossed, expectation is\r\nconcentrated on the present.  Having once embarked on your marital\r\nvoyage, you may become aware that you make no way, and that the sea is\r\nnot within sight—that in fact you are exploring an inclosed basin.”  So\r\nthe ungauged reservoir turns out to be an inclosed basin, but Dorothea\r\nwas prevented by her social lot, and perverse goodness, and puritanical\r\n“reversion,” from foreseeing that.  She might have been saved from her\r\ngloomy marital voyage “if she could have fed her affection with those\r\nchildlike caresses which are the bent of every sweet woman who has begun\r\nby showering kisses on the hard pate of her bald doll, creating a happy\r\nsoul within that woodenness from the wealth of her own love.”  Then,\r\nperhaps, Ladislaw would have been her first husband instead of her\r\nsecond, as he certainly was her first and only love.  Such are the\r\nchances and mischances in the lottery of matrimony.\r\n\r\nEqually admirable is the diagnosis of Gwendolen Harleth’s motives in\r\n“drifting toward the tremendous decision,” and finally landing in it.\r\n“We became poor, and I was tempted.”  Marriage came to her as it comes to\r\nmany, as a temptation, and like the deadening drug or the maddening bowl,\r\nto keep off the demon of remorse or the cloud of sorrow, like the forgery\r\nor the robbery to save from want.  “The brilliant position she had longed\r\nfor, the imagined freedom she would create for herself in marriage”—these\r\n“had come to her hunger like food, with the taint of sacrilege upon it,”\r\nwhich she “snatched with terror.”  Grandcourt “fulfilled his side of the\r\nbargain by giving her the rank and luxuries she coveted.”  Matrimony as a\r\nbargain never had and never will have but one result.  “She had a root of\r\nconscience in her, and the process of purgatory had begun for her on\r\nearth.”  Without the root of conscience it would have been purgatory all\r\nthe same.  So much for resorting to marriage for deliverance from poverty\r\nor old maidhood.  Better be an old maid than an old fool.  But how are we\r\nto be guaranteed against “one of those convulsive motiveless actions by\r\nwhich wretched men and women leap from a temporary sorrow into a lifelong\r\nmisery?”  Rosamond Lydgate says, “Marriage stays with us like a murder.”\r\nYes, if she could only have found that out before instead of after her\r\nown marriage!\r\n\r\nBut “what greater thing,” exclaims our novelist, “is there for two human\r\nsouls than to feel that they are joined for life, to strengthen each\r\nother in all labor, to minister to each other in all pain, to be one with\r\neach other in silent, unspeakable memories at the last parting?”\r\n\r\nWhile a large proportion of her work in the analysis of motives is\r\nconfined to woman, she has done nothing more skilful or memorable than\r\nthe “unravelling” of Bulstrode’s mental processes by which he “explained\r\nthe gratification of his desires into satisfactory agreement with his\r\nbeliefs.”  If there were no Dorothea in “Middlemarch” the character of\r\nBulstrode would give that novel a place by itself among the masterpieces\r\nof fiction.  The Bulstrode wound was never probed in fiction with more\r\nscientific precision.  The pious villain finally finds himself so near\r\ndiscovery that he becomes conscientious.  “His equivocation now turns\r\nvenomously upon him with the full-grown fang of a discovered lie.”  The\r\npast came back to make the present unendurable.  “The terror of being\r\njudged sharpens the memory.”  Once more “he saw himself the banker’s\r\nclerk, as clever in figures as he was fluent in speech, and fond of\r\ntheological definition.  He had striking experience in conviction and\r\nsense of pardon; spoke in prayer-meeting and on religious platforms.\r\nThat was the time he would have chosen now to awake in and find the rest\r\nof dream.  He remembered his first moments of shrinking.  They were\r\nprivate and were filled with arguments—some of these taking the form of\r\nprayer.”\r\n\r\nPrivate prayer—but “is private prayer necessarily candid?  Does it\r\nnecessarily go to the roots of action?  Private prayer is inaudible\r\nspeech, and speech is representative.  Who can represent himself just as\r\nhe is, even in his own reflections?”\r\n\r\nBulstrode’s course up to the time of his being suspected “had, he\r\nthought, been sanctioned by remarkable providences, appearing to point\r\nthe way for him to be the agent in making the best use of a large\r\nproperty.”  Providence would have him use for the glory of God the money\r\nhe had stolen.  “Could it be for God’s service that this fortune should\r\ngo to” its rightful owners, when its rightful owners were “a young woman\r\nand her husband who were given up to the lightest pursuits, and might\r\nscatter it abroad in triviality—people who seemed to lie outside the path\r\nof remarkable providences?”\r\n\r\nBulstrode felt at times “that his action was unrighteous, but how could\r\nhe go back?  He had mental exercises calling himself naught, laid hold on\r\nredemption and went on in his course of instrumentality.”  He was\r\n“carrying on two distinct lives”—a religious one and a wicked one.  “His\r\nreligious activity could not be incompatible with his wicked business as\r\nsoon as he had argued himself into not feeling it incompatible.”\r\n\r\n“The spiritual kind of rescue was a genuine need with him.  There may be\r\ncoarse hypocrites, who consciously affect beliefs and emotions for the\r\nsake of gulling the world, but Bulstrode was not one of them.  He was\r\nsimply a man whose desires had been stronger than his theoretic beliefs,\r\nand who had gradually explained the gratification of his desires into\r\nsatisfactory agreement with those beliefs.”\r\n\r\nAnd now Providence seemed to be taking sides against him.  “A threatening\r\nProvidence—in other words, a public exposure—urged him to a kind of\r\npropitiation which was not a doctrinal transaction.  The divine tribunal\r\nhad changed its aspect to him.  Self-prostration was no longer enough.\r\nHe must bring restitution in his hand.  By what sacrifice could he stay\r\nthe rod?  He believed that if he did something right God would stay the\r\nrod, and save him from the consequences of his wrong-doing.”  His\r\nreligion was “the religion of personal fear,” which “remains nearly at\r\nthe level of the savage.”  The exposure comes, and the explosion.\r\nSociety shudders with hypocritical horror, especially in the presence of\r\npoor Mrs. Bulstrode, who “should have some hint given her, that if she\r\nknew the truth she would have less complacency in her bonnet.”  Society\r\nwhen it is very candid, and very conscientious, and very scrupulous,\r\ncannot “allow a wife to remain ignorant long that the town holds a bad\r\nopinion of her husband.”  The photograph of the Middlemarch gossips\r\nsitting upon the case of Mrs. Bulstrode is taken accurately.  Equally\r\naccurate, and far more impressive, is the narrative of circumstantial\r\nevidence gathering against the innocent Lydgate and the guilty\r\nBulstrode—circumstances that will sometimes weave into one tableau of\r\npublic odium the purest and the blackest characters.  From this tableau\r\nyou may turn to that one in “Adam Bede,” and see how circumstances are\r\nmade to crush the weak woman and clear the wicked man.  And then you can\r\ngo to “Romola,” or indeed to almost any of these novels, and see how\r\nwrong-doing may come of an indulged infirmity of purpose, that\r\nunconscious weakness and conscious wickedness may bring about the same\r\ndisastrous results, and that repentance has no more effect in averting or\r\naltering the consequences in one case than the other.  Tito’s ruin comes\r\nof a feeble, Felix Holt’s victory of an unconquerable, will.  Nothing is\r\nmore characteristic of George Eliot than her tracking of Tito through all\r\nthe motives and counter motives from which he acted.  “Because he tried\r\nto slip away from everything that was unpleasant, and cared for nothing\r\nso much as his own safety, he came at last to commit such deeds as make a\r\nman infamous.”  So poor Romola tells her son, as a warning, and adds: “If\r\nyou make it the rule of your life to escape from what is disagreeable,\r\ncalamity may come just the same, and it would be calamity falling on a\r\nbase mind, which is the one form of sorrow that has no balm in it.”\r\n\r\nOut of this passion for the analysis of motives comes the strong\r\ncharacter, slightly gnarled and knotted by natural circumstances, as\r\ntrees that are twisted and misshapen by storms and floods—or characters\r\ngnarled by some interior force working in conjunction with or in\r\nopposition to outward circumstances.  She draws no monstrosities, or\r\nmonsters, thus avoiding on the one side romance and on the other\r\nburlesque.  She keeps to life—the life that fails from “the meanness of\r\nopportunity,” or is “dispersed among hindrances” or “wrestles”\r\nunavailingly “with universal pressure.”\r\n\r\nWhy had Mr. Gilfil in those late years of his beneficent life “more of\r\nthe knots and ruggedness of poor human nature than there lay any clear\r\nhint of it in the open-eyed, loving” young Maynard?  Because “it is with\r\nmen as with trees: if you lop off their finest branches into which they\r\nwere pouring their young life-juice, the wounds will be healed over with\r\nsome rough boss, some odd excrescence, and what might have been a grand\r\ntree, expanding into liberal shade, is but a whimsical, misshapen trunk.\r\nMany an irritating fault, many an unlovely oddity, has come of a hard\r\nsorrow which has crushed and maimed the nature just when it was expanding\r\ninto plenteous beauty; and the trivial, erring life, which we visit with\r\nour harsh blame, may be but as the unsteady motion of a man whose best\r\nlimb is withered.  The dear old Vicar had been sketched out by nature as\r\na noble tree.  The heart of him was sound, the grain was of the finest,\r\nand in the gray-haired man, with his slipshod talk and caustic tongue,\r\nthere was the main trunk of the same brave, faithful, tender nature that\r\nhad poured out the finest, freshest forces of its life-current in a first\r\nand only love.”\r\n\r\nHer style is influenced by her purpose—may be said, indeed, to be created\r\nby it.  The excellences and the blemishes of the diction come of the end\r\nsought to be attained by it.  Its subtleties and obscurities were equally\r\ninevitable.  Analytical thinking takes on an analytical phraseology.  It\r\nis a striking instance of a mental habit creating a vocabulary.  The\r\nmethod of thought produces the form of rhetoric.  Some of the sentences\r\nare mental landscapes.  The meaning seems to be in motion on the page.\r\nIt is elusive from its very subtlety.  It is more our analyst than her\r\ncharacter of Rufus Lyon, who “would fain find language subtle enough to\r\nfollow the utmost intricacies of the soul’s pathways.”  Mrs. Transome’s\r\n“lancet-edged epigrams” are dull in comparison with her own.  She uses\r\nthem with startling success in dissecting motive and analyzing feeling.\r\nThey deserve as great renown as “Nélaton’s probe.”\r\n\r\nFor example: “Examine your words well, and you will find that even when\r\nyou have no motive to be false, it is a very hard thing to say the exact\r\ntruth, especially about your own feelings—much harder than to say\r\nsomething fine about them which is not the exact truth.”  That ought to\r\nmake such a revelation of the religious diary-keeper to himself as to\r\nmake him ashamed of himself.  And this will fit in here: “Our consciences\r\nare not of the same pattern, an inner deliverance of fixed laws—they are\r\nthe voice of sensibilities as various as our memories;” and this: “Every\r\nstrong feeling makes to itself a conscience of its own—has its own\r\npiety.”\r\n\r\nWho can say that the joints of his armor are not open to this thrust?\r\n“The lapse of time during which a given event has not happened is in the\r\nlogic of habit, constantly alleged as a reason why the event should never\r\nhappen, even when the lapse of time is precisely the added condition\r\nwhich makes the event imminent.  A man will tell you that he worked in a\r\nmine for forty years unhurt by an accident as a reason why he should\r\napprehend no danger, though the roof is beginning to sink.”  Silas Marner\r\nlost his money through his “sense of security,” which “more frequently\r\nsprings from habit than conviction.”  He went unrobbed for fifteen years,\r\nwhich supplied the only needed condition for his being robbed now.  A\r\ncompensation for stupidity: “If we had a keen vision and feeling of all\r\nordinary human life, it would be like hearing the grass grow and the\r\nsquirrel’s heart beat, and we should die of that roar that lies on the\r\nother side of silence.  As it is, the quickest of us walk about well\r\nwadded with stupidity.”  Who does not at once recognize “that mixture of\r\npushing forward and being pushed forward” as “the brief history of most\r\nhuman beings?”  Who has not seen “advancement hindered by impetuous\r\ncandor?” or “private grudges christened by the name of public zeal?” or\r\n“a church built with an exuberance of faith and a deficiency of funds?”\r\nor a man “who would march determinedly along the road he thought best,\r\nbut who was easily convinced which was best?” or a preacher “whose\r\noratory was like a Belgian railway horn, which shows praiseworthy\r\nintentions inadequately fulfilled?”\r\n\r\nThere is something chemical about such an analysis as this of Rosamond:\r\n“Every nerve and muscle was adjusted to the consciousness that she was\r\nbeing looked at.  She was by nature an actress of parts that entered into\r\nher physique.  She even acted her own character, and so well that she did\r\nnot know it to be precisely her own!”  Nor is the exactness of this any\r\nless cruel: “We may handle extreme opinions with impunity, while our\r\nfurniture and our dinner-giving link us to the established order.”  Why\r\nnot own that “the emptiness of all things is never so striking to us as\r\nwhen we fail in them?”  Is it not better to avoid “following great\r\nreformers beyond the threshold of their own homes?”  Does not “our moral\r\nsense learn the manners of good society?”\r\n\r\nThe lancet works impartially, because the hand that holds it is the hand\r\nof a conscientious artist.  She will endure the severest test you can\r\napply to an artist in fiction.  She does not betray any religious bias in\r\nher novels, which is all the more remarkable now that we find it in these\r\nessays.  Nor is it at all remarkable that this bias is so very easily\r\ndiscovered in the novels by those who have found it in her essays!\r\nWhatever opinions she may have expressed in her critical reviews, she is\r\nnot the Evangelical, or the Puritan, or the Jew, or the Methodist, or the\r\nDissenting Minister, or the Churchman, any more than she is the Radical,\r\nthe Liberal, or the Tory, who talks in the pages of her fiction.\r\n\r\nEvery side has its say, every prejudice its voice, and every prejudice\r\nand side and vagary even has the philosophical reason given for it, and\r\nthe charitable explanation applied to it.  She analyzes the religious\r\nmotives without obtrusive criticism or acrid cynicism or nauseous\r\ncant—whether of the orthodox or heretical form.\r\n\r\nThe art of fiction has nothing more elevated, or more touching, or fairer\r\nto every variety of religious experience, than the delineation of the\r\nmotives that actuated Dinah Morris the Methodist preacher, Deronda the\r\nJew, Dorothea the Puritan, Adam and Seth Bede, and Janet Dempster.\r\n\r\nWho can object to this?  “Religious ideas have the fate of melodies,\r\nwhich, once set afloat in the world, are taken up by all sorts of\r\ninstruments, some of them woefully coarse, feeble, or out of tune, until\r\npeople are in danger of crying out that the melody itself is detestable.”\r\nIs it not one of the “mixed results of revivals” that “some gain a\r\nreligious vocabulary rather than a religious experience?”  Is there a\r\ndescendant of the Puritans who will not relish the fair play of this?\r\n“They might give the name of piety to much that was only Puritanic\r\negoism; they might call many things sin that were not sin, but they had\r\nat least the feeling that sin was to be avoided and resisted, and\r\ncolor-blindness, which may mistake drab for scarlet, is better than total\r\nblindness, which sees no distinction of color at all.”  Is not Adam Bede\r\njustified in saying that “to hear some preachers you’d think a man must\r\nbe doing nothing all his life but shutting his eyes and looking at what’s\r\ngoing on in the inside of him,” or that “the doctrines are like finding\r\nnames for your feelings so that you can talk of them when you’ve never\r\nknown them?”  Read all she has said before you object to anything she has\r\nsaid.  Then see whether you will find fault with her for delineating the\r\nmotives of those with whom “great illusions” are mistaken for “great\r\nfaith;” of those “whose celestial intimacies do not improve their\r\ndomestic manners,” however “holy” they may claim to be; of those who\r\n“contrive to conciliate the consciousness of filthy rags with the best\r\ndamask;” of those “whose imitative piety and native worldliness is\r\nequally sincere;” of those who “think the invisible powers will be\r\nsoothed by a bland parenthesis here and there, coming from a man of\r\nproperty”—parenthetical recognition of the Almighty!  May not “religious\r\nscruples be like spilled needles, making one afraid of treading or\r\nsitting down, or even eating?”\r\n\r\nBut if this is a great mind fascinated with the insoluble enigma of human\r\nmotives, it is a mind profoundly in sympathy with those who are puzzling\r\nhopelessly over the riddle or are struggling hopelessly in its toils.\r\nShe is “on a level and in the press with them as they struggle their way\r\nalong the stony road through the crowd of unloving fellow-men.”  She says\r\n“the only true knowledge of our fellows is that which enables us to feel\r\nwith them, which gives us a finer ear for the heart-pulses that are\r\nbeating under the mere clothes of circumstance and opinion.”  No artist\r\nin fiction ever had a finer ear or a more human sympathy for the\r\nstraggler who “pushes manfully on” and “falls at last,” leaving “the\r\ncrowd to close over the space he has left.”  Her extraordinary skill in\r\ndisclosing “the peculiar combination of outward with inward facts which\r\nconstitute a man’s critical actions,” only makes her the more charitable\r\nin judging them.  “Until we know what this combination has been, or will\r\nbe, it will be better not to think ourselves wise about” the character\r\nthat results.  “There is a terrible coercion in our deeds which may first\r\nturn the honest man into a deceiver, and then reconcile him to the\r\nchange.  And for this reason the second wrong presents itself to him in\r\nthe guise of the only practicable right.”  There is nothing of the spirit\r\nof “served him right,” or “just what she deserved,” or “they ought to\r\nhave known better,” in George Eliot.  That is not in her line.  The\r\nopposite of that is exactly in her line.  This is characteristic of her:\r\n“In this world there are so many of these common, coarse people, who have\r\nno picturesque or sentimental wretchedness!  And it is so needful we\r\nshould remember their existence, else we may happen to leave them quite\r\nout of our religion and philosophy, and frame lofty theories which only\r\nfit a world of extremes.”  She does not leave them out.  Her books are\r\nfull of them, and of a Christly charity and plea for them.  Who can ever\r\nforget little Tiny, “hidden and uncared for as the pulse of anguish in\r\nthe breast of the bird that has fluttered down to its nest with the\r\nlong-sought food, and has found the nest torn and empty?”  There is\r\nnothing in fiction to surpass in pathos the picture of the death of Mrs.\r\nAmos Barton.  George Eliot’s fellow-feeling comes of the habit she\r\nascribes to Daniel Deronda, “the habit of thinking herself imaginatively\r\ninto the experience of others.”  That is the reason why her novels come\r\nhome so pitilessly to those who have had a deep experience of human life.\r\nThese are the men and women whom she fascinates and alienates.  I know\r\nstrong men and brave women who are afraid of her books, and say so.  It\r\nis because of her realness, her unrelenting fidelity to human nature and\r\nhuman life.  It is because the analysis is so delicate, subtle, and\r\nfar-in.  Hence the atmosphere of sadness that pervades her pages.  It was\r\nunavoidable.  To see only the behavior, as Dickens did, amuses us; to\r\nstudy only the motive at the root of the behavior, as George Eliot does,\r\nsaddens us.  The humor of Mrs. Poyser and the wit of Mrs. Transome only\r\ndeepen the pathos by relieving it.  There is hardly a sarcasm in these\r\nbooks but has its pensive undertone.\r\n\r\nIt is all in the key of “Ye Banks and Braes o’ Bonnie Doon,” and that\r\nwould be an appropriate key for a requiem over the grave of George Eliot.\r\n\r\nAll her writings are now before the world, and are accessible to all.\r\nThey have taken their place, and will keep their place, high among the\r\nwritings of those of our age who have made that age illustrious in the\r\nhistory of the English tongue.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE ESSAYS OF “GEORGE ELIOT.”\r\n\r\n\r\nI.  CARLYLE’S LIFE OF STERLING.\r\n\r\n\r\nAs soon as the closing of the Great Exhibition afforded a reasonable hope\r\nthat there would once more be a reading public, “The Life of Sterling”\r\nappeared.  A new work by Carlyle must always be among the literary births\r\neagerly chronicled by the journals and greeted by the public.  In a book\r\nof such parentage we care less about the subject than about its\r\ntreatment, just as we think the “Portrait of a Lord” worth studying if it\r\ncome from the pencil of a Vandyck.  The life of John Sterling, however,\r\nhas intrinsic interest, even if it be viewed simply as the struggle of a\r\nrestless aspiring soul, yearning to leave a distinct impress of itself on\r\nthe spiritual development of humanity, with that fell disease which, with\r\na refinement of torture, heightens the susceptibility and activity of the\r\nfaculties, while it undermines their creative force.  Sterling, moreover,\r\nwas a man thoroughly in earnest, to whom poetry and philosophy were not\r\nmerely another form of paper currency or a ladder to fame, but an end in\r\nthemselves—one of those finer spirits with whom, amid the jar and hubbub\r\nof our daily life,\r\n\r\n          “The melodies abide\r\n    Of the everlasting chime.”\r\n\r\nBut his intellect was active and rapid, rather than powerful, and in all\r\nhis writings we feel the want of a stronger electric current to give that\r\nvigor of conception and felicity of expression, by which we distinguish\r\nthe undefinable something called genius; while his moral nature, though\r\nrefined and elevated, seems to have been subordinate to his intellectual\r\ntendencies and social qualities, and to have had itself little\r\ndetermining influence on his life.  His career was less exceptional than\r\nhis character: a youth marked by delicate health and studious tastes, a\r\nshort-lived and not very successful share in the management of the\r\n_Athenæum_, a fever of sympathy with Spanish patriots, arrested before it\r\nreached a dangerous crisis by an early love affair ending in marriage, a\r\nfifteen months’ residence in the West Indies, eight months of curate’s\r\nduty at Herstmonceux, relinquished on the ground of failing health, and\r\nthrough his remaining years a succession of migrations to the South in\r\nsearch of a friendly climate, with the occasional publication of an\r\n“article,” a tale, or a poem in _Blackwood_ or elsewhere—this, on the\r\nprosaic background of an easy competence, was what made up the outer\r\ntissue of Sterling’s existence.  The impression of his intellectual power\r\non his personal friends seems to have been produced chiefly by the\r\neloquence and brilliancy of his conversation; but the mere reader of his\r\nworks and letters would augur from them neither the wit nor the _curiosa\r\nfelicitas_ of epithet and imagery, which would rank him with the men\r\nwhose sayings are thought worthy of perpetuation in books of table-talk\r\nand “ana.”  The public, then, since it is content to do without\r\nbiographies of much more remarkable men, cannot be supposed to have felt\r\nany pressing demand even for a single life of Sterling; still less, it\r\nmight be thought, when so distinguished a writer as Archdeacon Hare had\r\nfurnished this, could there be any need for another.  But, in opposition\r\nto the majority of Mr. Carlyle’s critics, we agree with him that the\r\nfirst life is properly the justification of the second.  Even among the\r\nreaders personally unacquainted with Sterling, those who sympathized with\r\nhis ultimate alienation from the Church, rather than with his transient\r\nconformity, were likely to be dissatisfied with the entirely apologetic\r\ntone of Hare’s life, which, indeed, is confessedly an incomplete\r\npresentation of Sterling’s mental course after his opinions diverged from\r\nthose of his clerical biographer; while those attached friends (and\r\nSterling possessed the happy magic that secures many such) who knew him\r\nbest during this latter part of his career, would naturally be pained to\r\nhave it represented, though only by implication, as a sort of deepening\r\ndeclension ending in a virtual retraction.  Of such friends Carlyle was\r\nthe most eminent, and perhaps the most highly valued, and, as co-trustee\r\nwith Archdeacon Hare of Sterling’s literary character and writings, he\r\nfelt a kind of responsibility that no mistaken idea of his departed\r\nfriend should remain before the world without correction.  Evidently,\r\nhowever, his “Life of Sterling” was not so much the conscientious\r\ndischarge of a trust as a labor of love, and to this is owing its strong\r\ncharm.  Carlyle here shows us his “sunny side.”  We no longer see him\r\nbreathing out threatenings and slaughter as in the Latter-Day Pamphlets,\r\nbut moving among the charities and amenities of life, loving and\r\nbeloved—a Teufelsdröckh still, but humanized by a Blumine worthy of him.\r\nWe have often wished that genius would incline itself more frequently to\r\nthe task of the biographer—that when some great or good personage dies,\r\ninstead of the dreary three or five volumed compilations of letter, and\r\ndiary, and detail, little to the purpose, which two thirds of the reading\r\npublic have not the chance, nor the other third the inclination, to read,\r\nwe could have a real “Life,” setting forth briefly and vividly the man’s\r\ninward and outward struggles, aims, and achievements, so as to make clear\r\nthe meaning which his experience has for his fellows.  A few such lives\r\n(chiefly, indeed, autobiographies) the world possesses, and they have,\r\nperhaps, been more influential on the formation of character than any\r\nother kind of reading.  But the conditions required for the perfection of\r\nlife writing—personal intimacy, a loving and poetic nature which sees the\r\nbeauty and the depth of familiar things, and the artistic power which\r\nseizes characteristic points and renders them with lifelike effect—are\r\nseldom found in combination.  “The Life of Sterling” is an instance of\r\nthis rare conjunction.  Its comparatively tame scenes and incidents\r\ngather picturesqueness and interest under the rich lights of Carlyle’s\r\nmind.  We are told neither too little nor too much; the facts noted, the\r\nletters selected, are all such as serve to give the liveliest conception\r\nof what Sterling was and what he did; and though the book speaks much of\r\nother persons, this collateral matter is all a kind of scene-painting,\r\nand is accessory to the main purpose.  The portrait of Coleridge, for\r\nexample, is precisely adapted to bring before us the intellectual region\r\nin which Sterling lived for some time before entering the Church.  Almost\r\nevery review has extracted this admirable description, in which genial\r\nveneration and compassion struggle with irresistible satire; but the\r\nemphasis of quotation cannot be too often given to the following pregnant\r\nparagraph:\r\n\r\n    “The truth is, I now see Coleridge’s talk and speculation was the\r\n    emblem of himself.  In it, as in him, a ray of heavenly inspiration\r\n    struggled, in a tragically ineffectual degree, with the weakness of\r\n    flesh and blood.  He says once, he ‘had skirted the howling deserts\r\n    of infidelity.’  This was evident enough; but he had not had the\r\n    courage, in defiance of pain and terror, to press resolutely across\r\n    said deserts to the new firm lands of faith beyond; he preferred to\r\n    create logical _fata-morganas_ for himself on this hither side, and\r\n    laboriously solace himself with these.”\r\n\r\nThe above mentioned step of Sterling—his entering the Church—is the point\r\non which Carlyle is most decidedly at issue with Archdeacon Hare.  The\r\nlatter holds that had Sterling’s health permitted him to remain in the\r\nChurch, he would have escaped those aberrations from orthodoxy, which, in\r\nthe clerical view, are to be regarded as the failure and shipwreck of his\r\ncareer, apparently thinking, like that friend of Arnold’s who recommended\r\na curacy as the best means of clearing up Trinitarian difficulties, that\r\n“orders” are a sort of spiritual backboard, which, by dint of obliging a\r\nman to look as if he were strait, end by making him so.  According to\r\nCarlyle, on the contrary, the real “aberration” of Sterling was his\r\nchoice of the clerical profession, which was simply a mistake as to his\r\ntrue vocation:\r\n\r\n    “Sterling,” he says, “was not intrinsically, nor had ever been in the\r\n    highest or chief degree, a devotional mind.  Of course all excellence\r\n    in man, and worship as the supreme excellence, was part of the\r\n    inheritance of this gifted man; but if called to define him, I should\r\n    say artist, not saint, was the real bent of his being.”\r\n\r\nAgain:\r\n\r\n    “No man of Sterling’s veracity, had he clearly consulted his own\r\n    heart, or had his own heart been capable of clearly responding, and\r\n    not been bewildered by transient fantasies and theosophic moonshine,\r\n    could have undertaken this function.  His heart would have answered,\r\n    ‘No, thou canst not.  What is incredible to thee, thou shalt not, at\r\n    thy soul’s peril, attempt to believe!  Elsewhither for a refuge, or\r\n    die here.  Go to perdition if thou must, but not with a lie in thy\r\n    mouth; by the eternal Maker, no!’”\r\n\r\nFrom the period when Carlyle’s own acquaintance with Sterling commenced,\r\nthe Life has a double interest, from the glimpses it gives us of the\r\nwriter, as well as of his hero.  We are made present at their first\r\nintroduction to each other; we get a lively idea of their colloquies and\r\nwalks together, and in this easy way, without any heavy disquisition or\r\nnarrative, we obtain a clear insight into Sterling’s character and mental\r\nprogress.  Above all, we are gladdened with a perception of the affinity\r\nthat exists between noble souls, in spite of diversity in ideas—in what\r\nCarlyle calls “the logical outcome” of the faculties.  This “Life of\r\nSterling” is a touching monument of the capability human nature possesses\r\nof the highest love, the love of the good and beautiful in character,\r\nwhich is, after all, the essence of piety.  The style of the work, too,\r\nis for the most part at once pure and rich; there are passages of deep\r\npathos which come upon the reader like a strain of solemn music, and\r\nothers which show that aptness of epithet, that masterly power of close\r\ndelineation, in which, perhaps, no writer has excelled Carlyle.\r\n\r\nWe have said that we think this second “Life of Sterling” justified by\r\nthe first; but were it not so, the book would justify itself.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nII.  WOMAN IN FRANCE: MADAME DE SABLÉ. {31}\r\n\r\n\r\nIn 1847, a certain Count Leopold Ferri died at Padua, leaving a library\r\nentirely composed of works written by women, in various languages, and\r\nthis library amounted to nearly 32,000 volumes.  We will not hazard any\r\nconjecture as to the proportion of these volumes which a severe judge,\r\nlike the priest in Don Quixote, would deliver to the flames, but for our\r\nown part, most of these we should care to rescue would be the works of\r\nFrench women.  With a few remarkable exceptions, our own feminine\r\nliterature is made up of books which could have been better written by\r\nmen—books which have the same relation to literature is general, as\r\nacademic prize poems have to poetry: when not a feeble imitation, they\r\nare usually an absurd exaggeration of the masculine style, like the\r\nswaggering gait of a bad actress in male attire.  Few English women have\r\nwritten so much like a woman as Richardson’s Lady G.  Now we think it an\r\nimmense mistake to maintain that there is no sex in literature.  Science\r\nhas no sex: the mere knowing and reasoning faculties, if they act\r\ncorrectly, must go through the same process, and arrive at the same\r\nresult.  But in art and literature, which imply the action of the entire\r\nbeing, in which every fibre of the nature is engaged, in which every\r\npeculiar modification of the individual makes itself felt, woman has\r\nsomething specific to contribute.  Under every imaginable social\r\ncondition, she will necessarily have a class of sensations and\r\nemotions—the maternal ones—which must remain unknown to man; and the fact\r\nof her comparative physical weakness, which, however it may have been\r\nexaggerated by a vicious civilization, can never be cancelled, introduces\r\na distinctively feminine condition into the wondrous chemistry of the\r\naffections and sentiments, which inevitably gives rise to distinctive\r\nforms and combinations.  A certain amount of psychological difference\r\nbetween man and woman necessarily arises out of the difference of sex,\r\nand instead of being destined to vanish before a complete development of\r\nwoman’s intellectual and moral nature, will be a permanent source of\r\nvariety and beauty as long as the tender light and dewy freshness of\r\nmorning affect us differently from the strength and brilliancy of the\r\nmidday sun.  And those delightful women of France, who from the beginning\r\nof the seventeenth to the close of the eighteenth century, formed some of\r\nthe brightest threads in the web of political and literary history, wrote\r\nunder circumstances which left the feminine character of their minds\r\nuncramped by timidity, and unstrained by mistaken effort.  They were not\r\ntrying to make a career for themselves; they thought little, in many\r\ncases not at all, of the public; they wrote letters to their lovers and\r\nfriends, memoirs of their every-day lives, romances in which they gave\r\nportraits of their familiar acquaintances, and described the tragedy or\r\ncomedy which was going on before their eyes.  Always refined and\r\ngraceful, often witty, sometimes judicious, they wrote what they saw,\r\nthought, and felt in their habitual language, without proposing any model\r\nto themselves, without any intention to prove that women could write as\r\nwell as men, without affecting manly views or suppressing womanly ones.\r\nOne may say, at least with regard to the women of the seventeenth\r\ncentury, that their writings were but a charming accident of their more\r\ncharming lives, like the petals which the wind shakes from the rose in\r\nits bloom.  And it is but a twin fact with this, that in France alone\r\nwoman has had a vital influence on the development of literature; in\r\nFrance alone the mind of woman has passed like an electric current\r\nthrough the language, making crisp and definite what is elsewhere heavy\r\nand blurred; in France alone, if the writings of women were swept away, a\r\nserious gap would be made in the national history.\r\n\r\nPatriotic gallantry may perhaps contend that English women could, if they\r\nhad liked, have written as well as their neighbors; but we will leave the\r\nconsideration of that question to the reviewers of the literature that\r\nmight have been.  In the literature that actually is, we must turn to\r\nFrance for the highest examples of womanly achievement in almost every\r\ndepartment.  We confess ourselves unacquainted with the productions of\r\nthose awful women of Italy, who held professorial chairs, and were great\r\nin civil and canon law; we have made no researches into the catacombs of\r\nfemale literature, but we think we may safely conclude that they would\r\nyield no rivals to that which is still unburied; and here, we suppose,\r\nthe question of pre-eminence can only lie between England and France.\r\nAnd to this day, Madame de Sévigné remains the single instance of a woman\r\nwho is supreme in a class of literature which has engaged the ambition of\r\nmen; Madame Dacier still reigns the queen of blue stockings, though women\r\nhave long studied Greek without shame; {33} Madame de Staël’s name still\r\nrises first to the lips when we are asked to mention a woman of great\r\nintellectual power; Madame Roland is still the unrivalled type of the\r\nsagacious and sternly heroic, yet lovable woman; George Sand is the\r\nunapproached artist who, to Jean Jacques’ eloquence and deep sense of\r\nexternal nature, unites the clear delineation of character and the tragic\r\ndepth of passion.  These great names, which mark different epochs, soar\r\nlike tall pines amidst a forest of less conspicuous, but not less\r\nfascinating, female writers; and beneath these, again, are spread, like a\r\nthicket of hawthorns, eglantines, and honey-suckles, the women who are\r\nknown rather by what they stimulated men to write, than by what they\r\nwrote themselves—the women whose tact, wit, and personal radiance created\r\nthe atmosphere of the _Salon_, where literature, philosophy, and science,\r\nemancipated from the trammels of pedantry and technicality, entered on a\r\nbrighter stage of existence.\r\n\r\nWhat were the causes of this earlier development and more abundant\r\nmanifestation of womanly intellect in France?  The primary one, perhaps,\r\nlies in the physiological characteristics of the Gallic race—the small\r\nbrain and vivacious temperament which permit the fragile system of woman\r\nto sustain the superlative activity requisite for intellectual\r\ncreativeness; while, on the other hand, the larger brain and slower\r\ntemperament of the English and Germans are, in the womanly organization,\r\ngenerally dreamy and passive.  The type of humanity in the latter may be\r\ngrander, but it requires a larger sum of conditions to produce a perfect\r\nspecimen.  Throughout the animal world, the higher the organization, the\r\nmore frequent is the departure from the normal form; we do not often see\r\nimperfectly developed or ill-made insects, but we rarely see a perfectly\r\ndeveloped, well-made man.  And thus the _physique_ of a woman may suffice\r\nas the substratum for a superior Gallic mind, but is too thin a soil for\r\na superior Teutonic one.  Our theory is borne out by the fact that among\r\nour own country-women those who distinguish themselves by literary\r\nproduction more frequently approach the Gallic than the Teutonic type;\r\nthey are intense and rapid rather than comprehensive.  The woman of large\r\ncapacity can seldom rise beyond the absorption of ideas; her physical\r\nconditions refuse to support the energy required for spontaneous\r\nactivity; the voltaic-pile is not strong enough to produce\r\ncrystallizations; phantasms of great ideas float through her mind, but\r\nshe has not the spell which will arrest them, and give them fixity.\r\nThis, more than unfavorable external circumstances, is, we think, the\r\nreason why woman has not yet contributed any new form to art, any\r\ndiscovery in science, any deep-searching inquiry in philosophy.  The\r\nnecessary physiological conditions are not present in her.  That under\r\nmore favorable circumstances in the future, these conditions may prove\r\ncompatible with the feminine organization, it would be rash to deny.  For\r\nthe present, we are only concerned with our theory so far as it presents\r\na physiological basis for the intellectual effectiveness of French women.\r\n\r\nA secondary cause was probably the laxity of opinion and practice with\r\nregard to the marriage-tie.  Heaven forbid that we should enter on a\r\ndefence of French morals, most of all in relation to marriage!  But it is\r\nundeniable that unions formed in the maturity of thought and feeling, and\r\ngrounded only on inherent fitness and mutual attraction, tended to bring\r\nwomen into more intelligent sympathy with men, and to heighten and\r\ncomplicate their share in the political drama.  The quiescence and\r\nsecurity of the conjugal relation are doubtless favorable to the\r\nmanifestation of the highest qualities by persons who have already\r\nattained a high standard of culture, but rarely foster a passion\r\nsufficient to rouse all the faculties to aid in winning or retaining its\r\nbeloved object—to convert indolence into activity, indifference into\r\nardent partisanship, dulness into perspicuity.  Gallantry and intrigue\r\nare sorry enough things in themselves, but they certainly serve better to\r\narouse the dormant faculties of woman than embroidery and domestic\r\ndrudgery, especially when, as in the high society of France in the\r\nseventeenth century, they are refined by the influence of Spanish\r\nchivalry, and controlled by the spirit of Italian causticity.  The dreamy\r\nand fantastic girl was awakened to reality by the experience of wifehood\r\nand maternity, and became capable of loving, not a mere phantom of her\r\nown imagination, but a living man, struggling with the hatreds and\r\nrivalries of the political arena; she espoused his quarrels, she made\r\nherself, her fortune, and her influence, the stepping-stones of his\r\nambition; and the languid beauty, who had formerly seemed ready to “die\r\nof a rose,” was seen to become the heroine of an insurrection.  The vivid\r\ninterest in affairs which was thus excited in woman must obviously have\r\ntended to quicken her intellect, and give it a practical application; and\r\nthe very sorrows—the heart-pangs and regrets which are inseparable from a\r\nlife of passion—deepened her nature by the questioning of self and\r\ndestiny which they occasioned, and by the energy demanded to surmount\r\nthem and live on.  No wise person, we imagine, wishes to restore the\r\nsocial condition of France in the seventeenth century, or considers the\r\nideal programme of woman’s life to be a _marriage de convenance_ at\r\nfifteen, a career of gallantry from twenty to eight-and-thirty, and\r\npenitence and piety for the rest of her days.  Nevertheless, that social\r\ncondition has its good results, as much as the madly superstitious\r\nCrusades had theirs.\r\n\r\nBut the most indisputable source of feminine culture and development in\r\nFrance was the influence of the _salons_, which, as all the world knows,\r\nwere _réunions_ of both sexes, where conversation ran along the whole\r\ngamut of subjects, from the frothiest _vers de société_ to the philosophy\r\nof Descartes.  Richelieu had set the fashion of uniting a taste for\r\nletters with the habits of polite society and the pursuits of ambition;\r\nand in the first quarter of the seventeenth century there were already\r\nseveral hôtels in Paris, varying in social position from the closest\r\nproximity of the Court to the debatable ground of the aristocracy and the\r\nbourgeoisie, which served as a rendezvous for different circles of\r\npeople, bent on entertaining themselves either by showing talent or\r\nadmiring it.  The most celebrated of these rendezvous was the Hôtel de\r\nRambouillet, which was at the culmination of its glory in 1630, and did\r\nnot become quite extinct until 1648, when the troubles of the Fronde\r\ncommencing, its _habitués_ were dispersed or absorbed by political\r\ninterests.  The presiding genius of this _salon_, the Marquise de\r\nRambouillet, was the very model of the woman who can act as anamalgam to\r\nthe most incongruous elements; beautiful, but not preoccupied by\r\ncoquetry, or passion; an enthusiastic admirer of talent, but with no\r\npretensions to talent on her own part; exquisitely refined in language\r\nand manners, but warm and generous withal; not given to entertain her\r\nguests with her own compositions, or to paralyze them by her universal\r\nknowledge.  She had once _meant_ to learn Latin, but had been prevented\r\nby an illness; perhaps she was all the better acquainted with Italian and\r\nSpanish productions, which, in default of a national literature, were\r\nthen the intellectual pabulum of all cultivated persons in France who are\r\nunable to read the classics.  In her mild, agreeable presence was\r\naccomplished that blending of the high-toned chivalry of Spain with the\r\ncaustic wit and refined irony of Italy, which issued in the creation of a\r\nnew standard of taste—the combination of the utmost exaltation in\r\nsentiment with the utmost simplicity of language.  Women are peculiarly\r\nfitted to further such a combination—first, from their greater tendency\r\nto mingle affection and imagination with passion, and thus subtilize it\r\ninto sentiment; and next, from that dread of what overtaxes their\r\nintellectual energies, either by difficulty, or monotony, which gives\r\nthem an instinctive fondness for lightness of treatment and airiness of\r\nexpression, thus making them cut short all prolixity and reject all\r\nheaviness.  When these womanly characteristics were brought into\r\nconversational contact with the materials furnished by such minds as\r\nthose of Richelieu, Corneille, the Great Condé, Balzac, and Bossuet, it\r\nis no wonder that the result was something piquant and charming.  Those\r\nfamous _habitués_ of the Hôtel de Rambouillet did not, apparently, first\r\nlay themselves out to entertain the ladies with grimacing “small-talk,”\r\nand then take each other by the sword-knot to discuss matters of real\r\ninterest in a corner; they rather sought to present their best ideas in\r\nthe guise most acceptable to intelligent and accomplished women.  And the\r\nconversation was not of literature only: war, politics, religion, the\r\nlightest details of daily news—everything was admissible, if only it were\r\ntreated with refinement and intelligence.  The Hôtel de Rambouillet was\r\nno mere literary _réunion_; it included _hommes d’affaires_ and soldiers\r\nas well as authors, and in such a circle women would not become _bas\r\nbleus_ or dreamy moralizers, ignorant of the world and of human nature,\r\nbut intelligent observers of character and events.  It is easy to\r\nunderstand, however, that with the herd of imitators who, in Paris and\r\nthe provinces, aped the style of this famous _salon_, simplicity\r\ndegenerated into affectation, and nobility of sentiment was replaced by\r\nan inflated effort to outstrip nature, so that the _genre précieux_ drew\r\ndown the satire, which reached its climax in the _Précieuses Ridicules_\r\nand _Les Femmes Savantes_, the former of which appeared in 1660, and the\r\nlatter in 1673.  But Madelon and Caltros are the lineal descendants of\r\nMademoiselle Scudery and her satellites, quite as much as of the Hôtel de\r\nRambouillet.  The society which assembled every Saturday in her _salon_\r\nwas exclusively literary, and although occasionally visited by a few\r\npersons of high birth, bourgeois in its tone, and enamored of madrigals,\r\nsonnets, stanzas, and _bouts rimés_.  The affectation that decks trivial\r\nthings in fine language belongs essentially to a class which sees another\r\nabove it, and is uneasy in the sense of its inferiority; and this\r\naffectation is precisely the opposite of the original _genre précieux_.\r\n\r\nAnother centre from which feminine influence radiated into the national\r\nliterature was the Palais du Luxembourg, where Mademoiselle d’Orleans, in\r\ndisgrace at court on account of her share in the Fronde, held a little\r\ncourt of her own, and for want of anything else to employ her active\r\nspirit busied herself with literature.  One fine morning it occurred to\r\nthis princess to ask all the persons who frequented her court, among whom\r\nwere Madame de Sévigné, Madame de la Fayette, and La Rochefoucauld, to\r\nwrite their own portraits, and she at once set the example.  It was\r\nunderstood that defects and virtues were to be spoken of with like\r\ncandor.  The idea was carried out; those who were not clever or bold\r\nenough to write for themselves employing the pen of a friend.\r\n\r\n    “Such,” says M. Cousin, “was the pastime of Mademoiselle and her\r\n    friends during the years 1657 and 1658: from this pastime proceeded a\r\n    complete literature.  In 1659 Ségrais revised these portraits, added\r\n    a considerable number in prose and even in verse, and published the\r\n    whole in a handsome quarto volume, admirably printed, and now become\r\n    very rare, under the title, ‘Divers Portraits.’  Only thirty copies\r\n    were printed, not for sale, but to be given as presents by\r\n    Mademoiselle.  The work had a prodigious success.  That which had\r\n    made the fortune of Mademoiselle de Scudéry’s romances—the pleasure\r\n    of seeing one’s portrait a little flattered, curiosity to see that of\r\n    others, the passion which the middle class always have had and will\r\n    have for knowing what goes on in the aristocratic world (at that time\r\n    not very easy of access), the names of the illustrious persons who\r\n    were here for the first time described physically and morally with\r\n    the utmost detail, great ladies transformed all at once into writers,\r\n    and unconsciously inventing a new manner of writing, of which no book\r\n    gave the slightest idea, and which was the ordinary manner of\r\n    speaking of the aristocracy; this undefinable mixture of the natural,\r\n    the easy, and at the same time of the agreeable, and supremely\r\n    distinguished—all this charmed the court and the town, and very early\r\n    in the year 1659 permission was asked of Mademoiselle to give a new\r\n    edition of the privileged book for the use of the public in general.”\r\n\r\nThe fashion thus set, portraits multiplied throughout France, until in\r\n1688 La Bruyère adopted the form in his “Characters,” and ennobled it by\r\ndivesting it of personality.  We shall presently see that a still greater\r\nwork than La Bruyère’s also owed its suggestion to a woman, whose salon\r\nwas hardly a less fascinating resort than the Hôtel de Rambouillet\r\nitself.\r\n\r\nIn proportion as the literature of a country is enriched and culture\r\nbecomes more generally diffused, personal influence is less effective in\r\nthe formation of taste and in the furtherance of social advancement.  It\r\nis no longer the coterie which acts on literature, but literature which\r\nacts on the coterie; the circle represented by the word _public_ is ever\r\nwidening, and ambition, poising itself in order to hit a more distant\r\nmark, neglects the successes of the salon.  What was once lavished\r\nprodigally in conversation is reserved for the volume or the “article,”\r\nand the effort is not to betray originality rather than to communicate\r\nit.  As the old coach-roads have sunk into disuse through the creation of\r\nrailways, so journalism tends more and more to divert information from\r\nthe channel of conversation into the channel of the Press; no one is\r\nsatisfied with a more circumscribed audience than that very indeterminate\r\nabstraction “the public,” and men find a vent for their opinions not in\r\ntalk, but in “copy.”  We read the _Athenæum_ askance at the tea-table,\r\nand take notes from the _Philosophical Journal_ at a soirée; we invite\r\nour friends that we may thrust a book into their hands, and presuppose an\r\nexclusive desire in the “ladies” to discuss their own matters, “that we\r\nmay crackle the _Times_” at our ease.  In fact, the evident tendency of\r\nthings to contract personal communication within the narrowest limits\r\nmakes us tremble lest some further development of the electric telegraph\r\nshould reduce us to a society of mutes, or to a sort of insects\r\ncommunicating by ingenious antenna of our own invention.  Things were far\r\nfrom having reached this pass in the last century; but even then\r\nliterature and society had outgrown the nursing of coteries, and although\r\nmany _salons_ of that period were worthy successors of the Hôtel de\r\nRambouillet, they were simply a recreation, not an influence.  Enviable\r\nevenings, no doubt, were passed in them; and if we could be carried back\r\nto any of them at will, we should hardly know whether to choose the\r\nWednesday dinner at Madame Geoffrin’s, with d’Alembert, Mademoiselle de\r\nl’Espinasse, Grimm, and the rest, or the graver society which, thirty\r\nyears later, gathered round Condorcet and his lovely young wife.  The\r\n_salon_ retained its attractions, but its power was gone: the stream of\r\nlife had become too broad and deep for such small rills to affect it.\r\n\r\nA fair comparison between the French women of the seventeenth century and\r\nthose of the eighteenth would, perhaps, have a balanced result, though it\r\nis common to be a partisan on this subject.  The former have more\r\nexaltation, perhaps more nobility of sentiment, and less consciousness in\r\ntheir intellectual activity—less of the _femme auteur_, which was\r\nRousseau’s horror in Madame d’Epinay; but the latter have a richer fund\r\nof ideas—not more ingenuity, but the materials of an additional century\r\nfor their ingenuity to work upon.  The women of the seventeenth century,\r\nwhen love was on the wane, took to devotion, at first mildly and by\r\nhalves, as English women take to caps, and finally without compromise;\r\nwith the women of the eighteenth century, Bossuet and Massillon had given\r\nway to Voltaire and Rousseau; and when youth and beauty failed, then they\r\nwere thrown on their own moral strength.\r\n\r\nM. Cousin is especially enamored of the women of the seventeenth century,\r\nand relieves himself from his labors in philosophy by making researches\r\ninto the original documents which throw light upon their lives.  Last\r\nyear he gave us some results of these researches in a volume on the youth\r\nof the Duchess de Longueville; and he has just followed it up with a\r\nsecond volume, in which he further illustrates her career by tracing it\r\nin connection with that of her friend, Madame de Sablé.  The materials to\r\nwhich he has had recourse for this purpose are chiefly two celebrated\r\ncollections of manuscript: that of Conrart, the first secretary to the\r\nFrench Academy, one of those universally curious people who seem made for\r\nthe annoyance of contemporaries and the benefit of posterity; and that of\r\nValant, who was at once the physician, the secretary, and general steward\r\nof Madame de Sablé, and who, with or without her permission, possessed\r\nhimself of the letters addressed to her by her numerous correspondents\r\nduring the latter part of her life, and of various papers having some\r\npersonal or literary interest attached to them.  From these stores M.\r\nCousin has selected many documents previously unedited; and though he\r\noften leaves us something to desire in the arrangement of his materials,\r\nthis volume of his on Madame de Sablé is very acceptable to us, for she\r\ninterests us quite enough to carry us through more than three hundred\r\npages of rather scattered narrative, and through an appendix of\r\ncorrespondence in small type.  M. Cousin justly appreciates her character\r\nas “un heureux mélange de raison, d’esprit, d’agrément, et de bonté;” and\r\nperhaps there are few better specimens of the woman who is extreme in\r\nnothing but sympathetic in all things; who affects us by no special\r\nquality, but by her entire being; whose nature has no _tons criards_, but\r\nis like those textures which, from their harmonious blending of all\r\ncolors, give repose to the eye, and do not weary us though we see them\r\nevery day.  Madame de Sablé is also a striking example of the one order\r\nof influence which woman has exercised over literature in France; and on\r\nthis ground, as well as intrinsically, she is worth studying.  If the\r\nreader agrees with us he will perhaps be inclined, as we are, to dwell a\r\nlittle on the chief points in her life and character.\r\n\r\nMadeline de Souvré, daughter of the Marquis of Courtenvaux, a nobleman\r\ndistinguished enough to be chosen as governor of Louis XIII., was born in\r\n1599, on the threshold of that seventeenth century, the brilliant genius\r\nof which is mildly reflected in her mind and history.  Thus, when in 1635\r\nher more celebrated friend, Mademoiselle de Bourbon, afterward the\r\nDuchess de Longueville, made her appearance at the Hôtel de Rambouillet,\r\nMadame de Sablé had nearly crossed that tableland of maturity which\r\nprecedes a woman’s descent toward old age.  She had been married in 1614,\r\nto Philippe Emanuel de Laval-Montmorency, Seigneur de Bois-Dauphin, and\r\nMarquis de Sablé, of whom nothing further is known than that he died in\r\n1640, leaving her the richer by four children, but with a fortune\r\nconsiderably embarrassed.  With beauty and high rank added to the mental\r\nattractions of which we have abundant evidence, we may well believe that\r\nMadame de Sablé’s youth was brilliant.  For her beauty, we have the\r\ntestimony of sober Madame de Motteville, who also speaks of her as having\r\n“beaucoup de lumière et de sincérité;” and in the following passage very\r\ngraphically indicates one phase of Madame de Sablé’s character:\r\n\r\n    “The Marquise de Sablé was one of those whose beauty made the most\r\n    noise when the Queen came into France.  But if she was amiable, she\r\n    was still more desirous of appearing so; this lady’s self-love\r\n    rendered her too sensitive to the regard which men exhibited toward\r\n    her.  There yet existed in France some remains of the politeness\r\n    which Catherine de Medici had introduced from Italy, and the new\r\n    dramas, with all the other works in prose and verse, which came from\r\n    Madrid, were thought to have such great delicacy, that she (Madame de\r\n    Sablé) had conceived a high idea of the gallantry which the Spaniards\r\n    had learned from the Moors.\r\n\r\n    “She was persuaded that men can, without crime, have tender\r\n    sentiments for women—that the desire of pleasing them led men to the\r\n    greatest and finest actions—roused their intelligence, and inspired\r\n    them with liberality, and all sorts of virtues; but, on the other\r\n    hand, women, who were the ornament of the world, and made to be\r\n    served and adored, ought not to admit anything from them but their\r\n    respectful attentions.  As this lady supported her views with much\r\n    talent and great beauty, she had given them authority in her time,\r\n    and the number and consideration of those who continued to associate\r\n    with her have caused to subsist in our day what the Spaniards call\r\n    _finezas_.”\r\n\r\nHere is the grand element of the original _femme précieuse_, and it\r\nappears farther, in a detail also reported by Madame de Motteville, that\r\nMadame de Sablé had a passionate admirer in the accomplished Duc de\r\nMontmorency, and apparently reciprocated his regard; but discovering (at\r\nwhat period of their attachment is unknown) that he was raising a lover’s\r\neyes toward the queen, she broke with him at once.  “I have heard her\r\nsay,” tells Madame de Motteville, “that her pride was such with regard to\r\nthe Duc de Montmorency, that at the first demonstrations which he gave of\r\nhis change, she refused to see him any more, being unable to receive with\r\nsatisfaction attentions which she had to share with the greatest princess\r\nin the world.”  There is no evidence except the untrustworthy assertion\r\nof Tallement de Réaux, that Madame de Sablé had any other _liaison_ than\r\nthis; and the probability of the negative is increased by the ardor of\r\nher friendships.  The strongest of these was formed early in life with\r\nMademoiselle Dona d’Attichy, afterward Comtesse de Maure; it survived the\r\neffervescence of youth, and the closest intimacy of middle age, and was\r\nonly terminated by the death of the latter in 1663.  A little incident in\r\nthis friendship is so characteristic in the transcendentalism which was\r\nthen carried into all the affections, that it is worth relating at\r\nlength.  Mademoiselle d’Attichy, in her grief and indignation at\r\nRichelieu’s treatment of her relative, quitted Paris, and was about to\r\njoin her friend at Sablé, when she suddenly discovered that Madame de\r\nSablé, in a letter to Madame de Rambouillet, had said that her greatest\r\nhappiness would be to pass her life with Julie de Rambouillet, afterward\r\nMadame de Montausier.  To Anne d’Attichy this appears nothing less than\r\nthe crime of _lèse-amitié_.  No explanations will appease her: she\r\nrefuses to accept the assurance that the offensive expression was used\r\nsimply out of unreflecting conformity to the style of the Hôtel de\r\nRambouillet—that it was mere “_galimatias_.”  She gives up her journey,\r\nand writes a letter, which is the only one Madame de Sablé chose to\r\npreserve, when, in her period of devotion, she sacrificed the records of\r\nher youth.  Here it is:\r\n\r\n    “I have seen this letter in which you tell me there is so much\r\n    _galimatias_, and I assure you that I have not found any at all.  On\r\n    the contrary, I find everything very plainly expressed, and among\r\n    others, one which is too explicit for my satisfaction—namely, what\r\n    you have said to Madame de Rambouillet, that if you tried to imagine\r\n    a perfectly happy life for yourself, it would be to pass it all alone\r\n    with Mademoiselle de Rambouillet.  You know whether any one can be\r\n    more persuaded than I am of her merit; but I confess to you that that\r\n    has not prevented me from being surprised that you could entertain a\r\n    thought which did so great an injury to our friendship.  As to\r\n    believing that you said this to one, and wrote it to the other,\r\n    simply for the sake of paying them an agreeable compliment, I have\r\n    too high an esteem for your courage to be able to imagine that\r\n    complaisance would cause you thus to betray the sentiments of your\r\n    heart, especially on a subject in which, as they were unfavorable to\r\n    me, I think you would have the more reason for concealing them, the\r\n    affection which I have for you being so well known to every one, and\r\n    especially to Mademoiselle de Rambouillet, so that I doubt whether\r\n    she will not have been more sensible of the wrong you have done me,\r\n    than of the advantage you have given her.  The circumstance of this\r\n    letter falling into my hands has forcibly reminded me of these lines\r\n    of Bertaut:\r\n\r\n    “‘Malheureuse est l’ignorance\r\n    Et plus malheureux le savoir.”\r\n\r\n    “Having through this lost a confidence which alone rendered life\r\n    supportable to me, it is impossible for me to take the journey so\r\n    much thought of.  For would there be any propriety in travelling\r\n    sixty miles in this season, in order to burden you with a person so\r\n    little suited to you, that after years of a passion without parallel,\r\n    you cannot help thinking that the greatest pleasure of your life\r\n    would be to pass it without her?  I return, then, into my solitude,\r\n    to examine the defects which cause me so much unhappiness, and unless\r\n    I can correct them, I should have less joy than confusion in seeing\r\n    you.”\r\n\r\nIt speaks strongly for the charm of Madame de Sablé’s nature that she was\r\nable to retain so susceptible a friend as Mademoiselle d’Attichy in spite\r\nof numerous other friendships, some of which, especially that with Madame\r\nde Longueville, were far from lukewarm—in spite too of a tendency in\r\nherself to distrust the affection of others toward her, and to wait for\r\nadvances rather than to make them.  We find many traces of this tendency\r\nin the affectionate remonstrances addressed to her by Madame de\r\nLongueville, now for shutting herself up from her friends, now for\r\ndoubting that her letters are acceptable.  Here is a little passage from\r\none of these remonstrances which indicates a trait of Madame de Sablé,\r\nand is in itself a bit of excellent sense, worthy the consideration of\r\nlovers and friends in general: “I am very much afraid that if I leave to\r\nyou the care of letting me know when I can see you, I shall be a long\r\ntime without having that pleasure, and that nothing will incline you to\r\nprocure it me, for I have always observed a certain lukewarmness in your\r\nfriendship after our _explanations_, from which I have never seen you\r\nthoroughly recover; and that is why I dread explanations, for however\r\ngood they may be in themselves, since they serve to reconcile people, it\r\nmust always be admitted, to their shame, that they are at least the\r\neffect of a bad cause, and that if they remove it for a time they\r\n_sometimes leave a certain facility in getting angry again_, which,\r\nwithout diminishing friendship, renders its intercourse less agreeable.\r\nIt seems to me that I find all this in your behavior to me; so I am not\r\nwrong in sending to know if you wish to have me to-day.”  It is clear\r\nthat Madame de Sablé was far from having what Sainte-Beuve calls the one\r\nfault of Madame Necker—absolute perfection.  A certain exquisiteness in\r\nher physical and moral nature was, as we shall see, the source of more\r\nthan one weakness, but the perception of these weaknesses, which is\r\nindicated in Madame de Longueville’s letters, heightens our idea of the\r\nattractive qualities which notwithstanding drew from her, at the sober\r\nage of forty, such expressions as these: “I assure you that you are the\r\nperson in all the world whom it would be most agreeable to me to see, and\r\nthere is no one whose intercourse is a ground of truer satisfaction to\r\nme.  It is admirable that at all times, and amidst all changes, the taste\r\nfor your society remains in me; and, _if one ought to thank God for the\r\njoys which do not tend to salvation_, I should thank him with all my\r\nheart for having preserved that to me at a time in which he has taken\r\naway from me all others.”\r\n\r\nSince we have entered on the chapter of Madame de Sablé’s weaknesses,\r\nthis is the place to mention what was the subject of endless raillery\r\nfrom her friends—her elaborate precaution about her health, and her dread\r\nof infection, even from diseases the least communicable.  Perhaps this\r\nanxiety was founded as much on æsthetic as on physical grounds, on\r\ndisgust at the details of illness as much as on dread of suffering: with\r\na cold in the head or a bilious complaint, the exquisite _précieuse_ must\r\nhave been considerably less conscious of being “the ornament of the\r\nworld,” and “made to be adored.”  Even her friendship, strong as it was,\r\nwas not strong enough to overcome her horror of contagion; for when\r\nMademoiselle de Bourbon, recently become Madame de Longueville, was\r\nattacked by small-pox, Madame de Sablé for some time had not courage to\r\nvisit her, or even to see Mademoiselle de Rambouillet, who was assiduous\r\nin her attendance on the patient.  A little correspondence _à propos_ of\r\nthese circumstances so well exhibits the graceful badinage in which the\r\ngreat ladies of that day were adepts, that we are attempted to quote one\r\nshort letter.\r\n\r\n              “_Mlle. de Rambouillet to the Marquise de Sablé_.”\r\n\r\n    “Mlle. de Chalais (_dame de compagnie_ to the Marquise) will please\r\n    to read this letter to Mme. la Marquise, _out of_ a draught.\r\n\r\n    “Madame, I do not think it possible to begin my treaty with you too\r\n    early, for I am convinced that between the first proposition made to\r\n    me that I should see you, and the conclusion, you will have so many\r\n    reflections to make, so many physicians to consult, and so many fears\r\n    to surmount, that I shall have full leisure to air myself.  The\r\n    conditions which I offer to fulfil for this purpose are, not to visit\r\n    you until I have been three days absent from the Hôtel de Condé\r\n    (where Mme. de Longueville was ill), to choose a frosty day, not to\r\n    approach you within four paces, not to sit down on more than one\r\n    seat.  You may also have a great fire in your room, burn juniper in\r\n    the four corners, surround yourself with imperial vinegar, with rue\r\n    and wormwood.  If you can feel yourself safe under these conditions,\r\n    without my cutting off my hair, I swear to you to execute them\r\n    religiously; and if you want examples to fortify you, I can tell you\r\n    that the Queen consented to see M. Chaudebonne, when he had come\r\n    directly from Mme. de Bourbon’s room, and that Mme. d’Aiguillon, who\r\n    has good taste in such matters, and is free from reproach on these\r\n    points, has just sent me word that if I did not go to see her she\r\n    would come to me.”\r\n\r\nMadame de Sablé betrays in her reply that she winces under this raillery,\r\nand thus provokes a rather severe though polite rejoinder, which, added\r\nto the fact that Madame de Longueville is convalescent, rouses her\r\ncourage to the pitch of paying the formidable visit.  Mademoiselle de\r\nRambouillet, made aware through their mutual friend Voiture, that her\r\nsarcasm has cut rather too deep, winds up the matter by writing that very\r\ndifficult production a perfectly conciliatory yet dignified apology.\r\nPeculiarities like this always deepen with age, and accordingly, fifteen\r\nyears later, we find Madame D’Orleans in her “Princesse de Paphlagonia”—a\r\nromance in which she describes her court, with the little quarrels and\r\nother affairs that agitated it—giving the following amusing picture, or\r\nrather caricature, of the extent to which Madame de Sablé carried her\r\npathological mania, which seems to have been shared by her friend the\r\nCountess de Maure (Mademoiselle d’Attichy).  In the romance, these two\r\nladies appear under the names of Princesse Parthénie and the Reine de\r\nMionie.\r\n\r\n    “There was not an hour in the day in which they did not confer\r\n    together on the means of avoiding death, and on the art of rendering\r\n    themselves immortal.  Their conferences did not take place like those\r\n    of other people; the fear of breathing an air which was too cold or\r\n    too warm, the dread lest the wind should be too dry or too moist—in\r\n    short, the imagination that the weather might not be as temperate as\r\n    they thought necessary for the preservation of their health, caused\r\n    them to write letters from one room to the other.  It would be\r\n    extremely fortunate if these notes could be found, and formed into a\r\n    collection.  I am convinced that they would contain rules for the\r\n    regimen of life, precautions even as to the proper time for applying\r\n    remedies, and also remedies which Hippocrates and Galen, with all\r\n    their science, never heard of.  Such a collection would be very\r\n    useful to the public, and would be highly profitable to the faculties\r\n    of Paris and Montpellier.  If these letters were discovered, great\r\n    advantages of all kinds might be derived from them, for they were\r\n    princesses who had nothing mortal about them but the _knowledge_ that\r\n    they were mortal.  In their writings might be learned all politeness\r\n    in style, and the most delicate manner of speaking on all subjects.\r\n    There is nothing with which they were not acquainted; they knew the\r\n    affairs of all the States in the world, through the share they had in\r\n    all the intrigues of its private members, either in matters of\r\n    gallantry, as in other things, on which their advice was necessary;\r\n    either to adjust embroilments and quarrels, or to excite them, for\r\n    the sake of the advantages which their friends could derive from\r\n    them;—in a word, they were persons through whose hands the secrets of\r\n    the whole world had to pass.  The Princess Parthénie (Mme. de Sablé)\r\n    had a palate as delicate as her mind; nothing could equal the\r\n    magnificence of the entertainments she gave; all the dishes were\r\n    exquisite, and her cleanliness was beyond all that could be imagined.\r\n    It was in their time that writing came into use; previously nothing\r\n    was written but marriage contracts, and letters were never heard of;\r\n    thus it is to them that we owe a practice so convenient in\r\n    intercourse.”\r\n\r\nStill later in 1669, when the most uncompromising of the Port Royalists\r\nseemed to tax Madame de Sablé with lukewarmness that she did not join\r\nthem at Port-Royal-des-Champs, we find her writing to the stern M. de\r\nSévigny: “En vérité, je crois que je ne pourrois mieux faire que de tout\r\nquitter et de m’en aller là.  Mais que deviendroient ces frayeurs de\r\nn’avoir pas de médicines à choisir, ni de chirurgien pour me saigner?”\r\n\r\nMademoiselle, as we have seen, hints at the love of delicate eating,\r\nwhich many of Madame de Sablé’s friends numbered among her foibles,\r\nespecially after her religious career had commenced.  She had a genius\r\nin_ friandise_, and knew how to gratify the palate without offending the\r\nhighest sense of refinement.  Her sympathetic nature showed itself in\r\nthis as in other things; she was always sending _bonnes bouches_ to her\r\nfriends, and trying to communicate to them her science and taste in the\r\naffairs of the table.  Madame de Longueville, who had not the luxurious\r\ntendencies of her friend, writes: “Je vous demande au nom de Dieu, que\r\nvous ne me prépariez aucun ragoût.  Surtout ne me donnez point de festin.\r\nAu nom de Dieu, qu’il n’y ait rien que ce qu’on peut manger, car vous\r\nsavez que c’est inutile pour moi; de plus j’en ai scrupule.”  But other\r\nfriends had more appreciation of her niceties.  Voiture thanks her for\r\nher melons, and assures her that they are better than those of yesterday;\r\nMadame de Choisy hopes that her ridicule of Jansenism will not provoke\r\nMadame de Sablé to refuse her the receipt for salad; and La Rochefoucauld\r\nwrites: “You cannot do me a greater charity than to permit the bearer of\r\nthis letter to enter into the mysteries of your marmalade and your\r\ngenuine preserves, and I humbly entreat you to do everything you can in\r\nhis favor.  If I could hope for two dishes of those preserves, which I\r\ndid not deserve to eat before, I should be indebted to you all my life.”\r\nFor our own part, being as far as possible from fraternizing with those\r\nspiritual people who convert a deficiency into a principle, and pique\r\nthemselves on an obtuse palate as a point of superiority, we are not\r\ninclined to number Madame de Sablé’s _friandise_ among her defects.  M.\r\nCousin, too, is apologetic on this point.  He says:\r\n\r\n    “It was only the excess of a delicacy which can be really understood,\r\n    and a sort of fidelity to the character of _précieuse_.  As the\r\n    _précieuse_ did nothing according to common usage, she could not dine\r\n    like another.  We have cited a passage from Mme. de Motteville, where\r\n    Mme. de Sablé is represented in her first youth at the Hôtel de\r\n    Rambouillet, maintaining that woman is born to be an ornament to the\r\n    world, and to receive the adoration of men.  The woman worthy of the\r\n    name ought always to appear above material wants, and retain, even in\r\n    the most vulgar details of life, something distinguished and\r\n    purified.  Eating is a very necessary operation, but one which is not\r\n    agreeable to the eye.  Mme. de Sablé insisted on its being conducted\r\n    with a peculiar cleanliness.  According to her it was not every woman\r\n    who could with impunity be at table in the presence of a lover; the\r\n    first distortion of the face, she said, would be enough to spoil all.\r\n    Gross meals made for the body merely ought to be abandoned to\r\n    _bourgeoises_, and the refined woman should appear to take a little\r\n    nourishment merely to sustain her, and even to divert her, as one\r\n    takes refreshments and ices.  Wealth did not suffice for this: a\r\n    particular talent was required.  Mme. de Sablé was a mistress in this\r\n    art.  She had transported the aristocratic spirit, and the _genre\r\n    précieux_, good breeding and good taste, even into cookery.  Her\r\n    dinners, without any opulence, were celebrated and sought after.”\r\n\r\nIt is quite in accordance with all this that Madame de Sablé should\r\ndelight in fine scents, and we find that she did; for being threatened,\r\nin her Port Royal days, when she was at an advanced age, with the loss of\r\nsmell, and writing for sympathy and information to Mère Agnès, who had\r\nlost that sense early in life, she receives this admonition from the\r\nstern saint: “You would gain by this loss, my very dear sister, if you\r\nmade use of it as a satisfaction to God, for having had too much pleasure\r\nin delicious scents.”  Scarron describes her as\r\n\r\n    “La non pareille Bois-Dauphine,\r\n    _Entre dames perle très fine_,”\r\n\r\nand the superlative delicacy implied by this epithet seems to have\r\nbelonged equally to her personal habits, her affections, and her\r\nintellect.\r\n\r\nMadame de Sablé’s life, for anything we know, flowed on evenly enough\r\nuntil 1640, when the death of her husband threw upon her the care of an\r\nembarrassed fortune.  She found a friend in Réné de Longueil, Seigneur de\r\nMaisons, of whom we are content to know no more than that he helped\r\nMadame de Sablé to arrange her affairs, though only by means of\r\nalienating from her family the estate of Sablé, that his house was her\r\nrefuge during the blockade of Paris in 1649, and that she was not\r\nunmindful of her obligations to him, when, subsequently, her credit could\r\nbe serviceable to him at court.  In the midst of these pecuniary troubles\r\ncame a more terrible trial—the loss of her favorite son, the brave and\r\nhandsome Guy de Laval, who, after a brilliant career in the campaigns of\r\nCondé, was killed at the siege of Dunkirk, in 1646, when scarcely\r\nfour-and-twenty.  The fine qualities of this young man had endeared him\r\nto the whole army, and especially to Condé, had won him the hand of the\r\nChancellor Séguire’s daughter, and had thus opened to him the prospect of\r\nthe highest honors.  His loss seems to have been the most real sorrow of\r\nMadame de Sablé’s life.  Soon after followed the commotions of the\r\nFronde, which put a stop to social intercourse, and threw the closest\r\nfriends into opposite ranks.  According to Lenet, who relies on the\r\nauthority of Gourville, Madame de Sablé was under strong obligations to\r\nthe court, being in the receipt of a pension of 2000 crowns; at all\r\nevents, she adhered throughout to the Queen and Mazarin, but being as far\r\nas possible from a fierce partisan, and given both by disposition and\r\njudgment to hear both sides of the question, she acted as a conciliator,\r\nand retained her friends of both parties.  The Countess de Maure, whose\r\nhusband was the most obstinate of _frondeurs_, remained throughout her\r\nmost cherished friend, and she kept up a constant correspondence with the\r\nlovely and intrepid heroine of the Fronde, Madame de Longueville.  Her\r\nactivity was directed to the extinction of animosities, by bringing about\r\nmarriages between the Montagues and Capulets of the Fronde—between the\r\nPrince de Condé, or his brother, and the niece of Mazarin, or between the\r\nthree nieces of Mazarin and the sons of three noblemen who were\r\ndistinguished leaders of the Fronde.  Though her projects were not\r\nrealized, her conciliatory position enabled her to preserve all her\r\nfriendships intact, and when the political tempest was over, she could\r\nassemble around her in her residence, in the Place Royal, the same\r\nsociety as before.  Madame de Sablé was now approaching her twelfth\r\n_lustrum_, and though the charms of her mind and character made her more\r\nsought after than most younger women, it is not surprising that, sharing\r\nas she did in the religious ideas of her time, the concerns of\r\n“salvation” seemed to become pressing.  A religious retirement, which did\r\nnot exclude the reception of literary friends or the care for personal\r\ncomforts, made the most becoming frame for age and diminished fortune.\r\nJansenism was then to ordinary Catholicism what Puseyism is to ordinary\r\nChurch of Englandism in these days—it was a _récherché_ form of piety\r\nunshared by the vulgar; and one sees at once that it must have special\r\nattractions for the _précieuse_.  Madame de Sablé, then, probably about\r\n1655 or ’56, determined to retire to Port Royal, not because she was\r\nalready devout, but because she hoped to become so; as, however, she\r\nwished to retain the pleasure of intercourse with friends who were still\r\nworldly, she built for herself a set of apartments at once distinct from\r\nthe monastery and attached to it.  Here, with a comfortable\r\nestablishment, consisting of her secretary, Dr. Valant, Mademoiselle de\r\nChalais, formerly her _dame de compagnie_, and now become her friend; an\r\nexcellent cook; a few other servants, and for a considerable time a\r\ncarriage and coachman; with her best friends within a moderate distance,\r\nshe could, as M. Cousin says, be out of the noise of the world without\r\naltogether forsaking it, preserve her dearest friendships, and have\r\nbefore her eyes edifying examples—“vaquer enfin à son aise aux soins de\r\nson salut et à ceux de sa santé.”\r\n\r\nWe have hitherto looked only at one phase of Madame de Sablé’s character\r\nand influence—that of the _précieuse_.  But she was much more than this:\r\nshe was the valuable, trusted friend of noble women and distinguished\r\nmen; she was the animating spirit of a society, whence issued a new form\r\nof French literature; she was the woman of large capacity and large\r\nheart, whom Pascal sought to please, to whom Arnauld submitted the\r\nDiscourse prefixed to his “Logic,” and to whom La Rochefoucauld writes:\r\n“Vous savez que je ne crois que vous êtes sur de certains chapitres, et\r\nsurtout sur les replis da cœur.”  The papers preserved by her secretary,\r\nValant, show that she maintained an extensive correspondence with persons\r\nof various rank and character; that her pen was untiring in the interest\r\nof others; that men made her the depositary of their thoughts, women of\r\ntheir sorrows; that her friends were as impatient, when she secluded\r\nherself, as if they had been rival lovers and she a youthful beauty.  It\r\nis into her ear that Madame de Longueville pours her troubles and\r\ndifficulties, and that Madame de la Fayette communicates her little\r\nalarms, lest young Count de St. Paul should have detected her intimacy\r\nwith La Rochefoucauld. {53}  The few of Madame de Sablé’s letters which\r\nsurvive show that she excelled in that epistolary style which was the\r\nspecialty of the Hôtel de Rambouillet: one to Madame de Montausier, in\r\nfavor of M. Périer, the brother-in-law of Pascal, is a happy mixture of\r\ngood taste and good sense; but among them all we prefer quoting one to\r\nthe Duchess de la Tremouille.  It is light and pretty, and made out of\r\nalmost nothing, like soap, bubbles.\r\n\r\n    “Je croix qu’il n’y a que moi qui face si bien tout le contraire de\r\n    ce que je veux faire, car il est vrai qu’il n’y a personne que\r\n    j’honore plus que vous, et j’ai si bien fait qu’il est quasi\r\n    impossible que vous le puissiez croire.  Ce n’estoit pas assez pour\r\n    vous persuader que je suis indigne de vos bonnes grâces et de votre\r\n    souvenir que d’avoir manqué fort longtemps à vous écrire; il falloit\r\n    encore retarder quinze jours à me donner l’honneur de répondre à\r\n    votre lettre.  En vérité, Madame, cela me fait parôitre si coupable,\r\n    que vers tout autre que vous j’aimeroix mieux l’être en effet que\r\n    d’entreprendre une chose si difficile qu’ est celle de me justifier.\r\n    Mais je me sens si innocente dans mon âme, et j’ai tant d’estime, de\r\n    respect et d’affection pour vous, qu’il me semble que vous devez le\r\n    connôitre à cent lieues de distance d’ici, encore que je ne vous dise\r\n    pas un mot.  C’est ce que me donne le courage de vous écrire à cette\r\n    heure, mais non pas ce qui m’en a empêché si longtemps.  J’ai\r\n    commencé, a faillir par force, ayant eu beaucoup de maux, et depuis\r\n    je l’ai faite par honte, et je vous avoue que si je n’avois à cette\r\n    heure la confiance que vous m’avez donnée en me rassurant, et celle\r\n    que je tire de mes propres sentimens pour vous, je n’oserois jamais\r\n    entreprendre de vous faire souvenir de moi; mais je m’assure que vous\r\n    oublierez tout, sur la protestation que je vous fais de ne me laisser\r\n    plus endurcir en mes fautes et de demeurer inviolablement, Madame,\r\n    votre, etc.”\r\n\r\nWas not the woman, who could unite the ease and grace indicated by this\r\nletter, with an intellect that men thought worth consulting on matters of\r\nreasoning and philosophy, with warm affections, untiring activity for\r\nothers, no ambition as an authoress, and an insight into _confitures_ and\r\n_ragoûts_, a rare combination?  No wonder that her _salon_ at Port Royal\r\nwas the favorite resort of such women as Madame de la Fayette, Madame de\r\nMontausier, Madame de Longueville, and Madame de Hautefort; and of such\r\nmen as Pascal, La Rochefoucauld, Nicole, and Domat.  The collections of\r\nValant contain papers which show what were the habitual subjects of\r\nconversation in this salon.  Theology, of course, was a chief topic; but\r\nphysics and metaphysics had their turn, and still more frequently morals,\r\ntaken in their widest sense.  There were “Conferences on Calvinism,” of\r\nwhich an abstract is preserved.  When Rohault invented his glass tubes to\r\nserve for the barometrical experiments in which Pascal had roused a\r\nstrong interest, the Marquis de Sourdis entertained the society with a\r\npaper entitled “Why Water Mounts in a Glass Tube.”  Cartesianism was an\r\nexciting topic here, as well as everywhere else in France; it had its\r\npartisans and opponents, and papers were read containing “Thoughts on the\r\nOpinions of M. Descartes.”  These lofty matters were varied by\r\ndiscussions on love and friendship, on the drama, and on most of the\r\nthings in heaven and earth which the philosophy of that day dreamt of.\r\nMorals—generalizations on human affections, sentiments, and conduct—seem\r\nto have been the favorite theme; and the aim was to reduce these\r\ngeneralizations to their briefest form of expression, to give them the\r\nepigrammatic turn which made them portable in the memory.  This was the\r\nspecialty of Madame de Sablé’s circle, and was, probably, due to her own\r\ntendency.  As the Hôtel de Rambouillet was the nursery of graceful\r\nletter-writing, and the Luxembourg of “portraits” and “characters,” so\r\nMadame de Sablé’s _salon_ fostered that taste for the sententious style,\r\nto which we owe, probably, some of the best _Pensées_ of Pascal, and\r\ncertainly, the “Maxims” of La Rochefoucauld.  Madame de Sablé herself\r\nwrote maxims, which were circulated among her friends; and, after her\r\ndeath, were published by the Abbé d’Ailly.  They have the excellent sense\r\nand nobility of feeling which we should expect in everything of hers; but\r\nthey have no stamp of genius or individual character: they are, to the\r\n“Maxims” of La Rochefoucauld, what the vase moulded in dull, heavy clay\r\nis to the vase which the action of fire has made light, brittle, and\r\ntransparent.  She also wrote a treatise on Education, which is much\r\npraised by La Rochefoucauld and M. d’Andilly; but which seems no longer\r\nto be found: probably it was not much more elaborate than her so-called\r\n“Treatise on Friendship,” which is but a short string of maxims.  Madame\r\nde Sablé’s forte was evidently not to write herself, but to stimulate\r\nothers to write; to show that sympathy and appreciation which are as\r\ngenial and encouraging as the morning sunbeams.  She seconded a man’s wit\r\nwith understanding—one of the best offices which womanly intellect has\r\nrendered to the advancement of culture; and the absence of originality\r\nmade her all the more receptive toward the originality of others.\r\n\r\nThe manuscripts of Pascal show that many of the _Pensées_, which are\r\ncommonly supposed to be raw materials for a great work on religion, were\r\nremodelled again and again, in order to bring them to the highest degree\r\nof terseness and finish, which would hardly have been the case if they\r\nhad only been part of a quarry for a greater production.  Thoughts, which\r\nare merely collected as materials, as stones out of which a building is\r\nto be erected, are not cut into facets, and polished like amethysts or\r\nemeralds.  Since Pascal was from the first in the habit of visiting\r\nMadame de Sablé, at Port Royal, with his sister, Madame Périer (who was\r\none of Madame de Sablé’s dearest friends), we may well suppose that he\r\nwould throw some of his jewels among the large and small coin of maxims,\r\nwhich were a sort of subscription money there.  Many of them have an\r\nepigrammatical piquancy, which was just the thing to charm a circle of\r\nvivacious and intelligent women: they seem to come from a La\r\nRochefoucauld who has been dipped over again in philosophy and wit, and\r\nreceived a new layer.  But whether or not Madame de Sablé’s influence\r\nserved to enrich the _Pensées_ of Pascal, it is clear that but for her\r\ninfluence the “Maxims” of La Rochefoucauld would never have existed.\r\nJust as in some circles the effort is, who shall make the best puns\r\n(_horibile dictu_!), or the best charades, in the _salon_ of Port Royal\r\nthe amusement was to fabricate maxims.  La Rochefoucauld said, “L’envie\r\nde faire des maximes se gagne comme la rhume.”  So far from claiming for\r\nhimself the initiation of this form of writing, he accuses Jacques\r\nEsprit, another _habitué_ of Madame de Sablé’s _salon_, of having excited\r\nin him the taste for maxims, in order to trouble his repose.  The said\r\nEsprit was an academician, and had been a frequenter of the Hôtel de\r\nRambouillet.  He had already published “Maxims in Verse,” and he\r\nsubsequently produced a book called “La Faussete des Vertus Humaines,”\r\nwhich seems to consist of Rochefoucauldism become flat with an infusion\r\nof sour Calvinism.  Nevertheless, La Rochefoucauld seems to have prized\r\nhim, to have appealed to his judgment, and to have concocted maxims with\r\nhim, which he afterward begs him to submit to Madame Sablé.  He sends a\r\nlittle batch of maxims to her himself, and asks for an equivalent in the\r\nshape of good eatables: “Voilà tout ce que j’ai de maximes; mais comme je\r\nne donne rien pour rien, je vous demande un potage aux carottes, un\r\nragoût de mouton,” etc.  The taste and the talent enhanced each other;\r\nuntil, at last, La Rochefoucauld began to be conscious of his\r\npre-eminence in the circle of maxim-mongers, and thought of a wider\r\naudience.  Thus grew up the famous “Maxims,” about which little need be\r\nsaid.  Every at once is now convinced, or professes to be convinced,\r\nthat, as to form, they are perfect, and that as to matter, they are at\r\nonce undeniably true and miserably false; true as applied to that\r\ncondition of human nature in which the selfish instincts are still\r\ndominant, false if taken as a representation of all the elements and\r\npossibilities of human nature.  We think La Rochefoucauld himself wavered\r\nas to their universality, and that this wavering is indicated in the\r\nqualified form of some of the maxims; it occasionally struck him that the\r\nshadow of virtue must have a substance, but he had never grasped that\r\nsubstance—it had never been present to his consciousness.\r\n\r\nIt is curious to see La Rochefoucauld’s nervous anxiety about presenting\r\nhimself before the public as an author; far from rushing into print, he\r\nstole into it, and felt his way by asking private opinions.  Through\r\nMadame de Sablé he sent manuscript copies to various persons of taste and\r\ntalent, both men and women, and many of the written opinions which he\r\nreceived in reply are still in existence.  The women generally find the\r\nmaxims distasteful, but the men write approvingly.  These men, however,\r\nare for the most part ecclesiastics, who decry human nature that they may\r\nexalt divine grace.  The coincidence between Augustinianism or Calvinism,\r\nwith its doctrine of human corruption, and the hard cynicism of the\r\nmaxims, presents itself in quite a piquant form in some of the laudatory\r\nopinions on La Rochefoucauld.  One writer says: “On ne pourroit faire une\r\ninstruction plus propre à un catechumène pour convertir à Dieu son esprit\r\net sa volonté . . . Quand il n’y auroit que cet escrit au monde et\r\nl’Evangile je voudrois etre chretien.  L’un m’apprendroit à connoistre\r\nmes misères, et l’autre à implorer mon libérateur.”  Madame de Maintenon\r\nsends word to La Rochefoucauld, after the publication of his work, that\r\nthe “Book of Job” and the “Maxims” are her only reading.\r\n\r\nThat Madame de Sablé herself had a tolerably just idea of La\r\nRochefoucauld’s character, as well as of his maxims, may be gathered not\r\nonly from the fact that her own maxims are as full of the confidence in\r\nhuman goodness which La Rochefoucauld wants, as they are empty of the\r\nstyle which he possesses, but also from a letter in which she replies to\r\nthe criticisms of Madame de Schomberg.  “The author,” she says, “derived\r\nthe maxim on indolence from his own disposition, for never was there so\r\ngreat an indolence as his, and I think that his heart, inert as it is,\r\nowes this defect as much to his idleness as his will.  It has never\r\npermitted him to do the least action for others; and I think that, amid\r\nall his great desires and great hopes, he is sometimes indolent even on\r\nhis own behalf.”  Still she must have felt a hearty interest in the\r\n“Maxims,” as in some degree her foster-child, and she must also have had\r\nconsiderable affection for the author, who was lovable enough to those\r\nwho observed the rule of Helvetius, and expected nothing from him.  She\r\nnot only assisted him, as we have seen, in getting criticisms, and\r\ncarrying out the improvements suggested by them, but when the book was\r\nactually published she prepared a notice of it for the only journal then\r\nexisting—the _Journal des Savants_.  This notice was originally a brief\r\nstatement of the nature of the work, and the opinions which had been\r\nformed for and against it, with a moderate eulogy, in conclusion, on its\r\ngood sense, wit, and insight into human nature.  But when she submitted\r\nit to La Rochefoucauld he objected to the paragraph which stated the\r\nadverse opinion, and requested her to alter it.  She, however, was either\r\nunable or unwilling to modify her notice, and returned it with the\r\nfollowing note:\r\n\r\n    “Je vous envoie ce que j’ai pu tirer de ma teste pour mettre dans le\r\n    _Journal des Savants_.  J’y ai mis cet endroit qui vous est le plus\r\n    sensible, afin que cela vous fasse surmonter la mauvaise honte qui\r\n    vous fit mettre la préface sans y rien retrancher, et je n’ai pas\r\n    craint dele mettre, parce que je suis assurée que vous ne le ferez\r\n    pas imprimer, quand même le reste vous plairoit.  Je vous assure\r\n    aussi que je vous serai pins obligée, si vous en usez comme d’une\r\n    chose qui servit à vous pour le corriger on pour le jeter au feu.\r\n    Nous autres grands auteurs, nous sommes trop riches pour craindre de\r\n    rien perdre de nos productions.  Mandez-moi ce qu’il vous semble de\r\n    ce dictum.”\r\n\r\nLa Rochefoucauld availed himself of this permission, and “edited” the\r\nnotice, touching up the style, and leaving out the blame.  In this\r\nrevised form it appeared in the _Journal des Savants_.  In some points,\r\nwe see, the youth of journalism was not without promise of its future.\r\n\r\nWhile Madame de Sablé was thus playing the literary confidante to La\r\nRochefoucauld, and was the soul of a society whose chief interest was the\r\n_belles-lettres_, she was equally active in graver matters.  She was in\r\nconstant intercourse or correspondence with the devout women of Port\r\nRoyal, and of the neighboring convent of the Carmelites, many of whom had\r\nonce been the ornaments of the court; and there is a proof that she was\r\nconscious of being highly valued by them in the fact that when the\r\nPrincess Marie-Madeline, of the Carmelites, was dangerously ill, not\r\nbeing able or not daring to visit her, she sent her youthful portrait to\r\nbe hung up in the sick-room, and received from the same Mère Agnès, whose\r\ngrave admonition we have quoted above, a charming note, describing the\r\npleasure which the picture had given in the infirmary of “Notre bonne\r\nMère.”  She was interesting herself deeply in the translation of the New\r\nTestament, which was the work of Sacy, Arnauld, Nicole, Le Maître, and\r\nthe Duc de Luynes conjointly, Sacy having the principal share.  We have\r\nmentioned that Arnauld asked her opinion on the “Discourse” prefixed to\r\nhis “Logic,” and we may conclude from this that he had found her judgment\r\nvaluable in many other cases.  Moreover, the persecution of the Port\r\nRoyalists had commenced, and she was uniting with Madame de Longueville\r\nin aiding and protecting her pious friends.  Moderate in her Jansenism,\r\nas in everything else, she held that the famous formulary denouncing the\r\nAugustinian doctrine, and declaring it to have been originated by\r\nJansenius, should be signed without reserve, and, as usual, she had faith\r\nin conciliatory measures; but her moderation was no excuse for inaction.\r\nShe was at one time herself threatened with the necessity of abandoning\r\nher residence at Port Royal, and had thought of retiring to a religions\r\nhouse at Auteuil, a village near Paris.  She did, in fact, pass some\r\nsummers there, and she sometimes took refuge with her brother, the\r\nCommandeur de Souvré, with Madame de Montausier, or Madame de\r\nLongueville.  The last was much bolder in her partisanship than her\r\nfriend, and her superior wealth and position enabled her to give the Port\r\nRoyalists more efficient aid.  Arnauld and Nicole resided five years in\r\nher house; it was under her protection that the translation of the New\r\nTestament was carried on and completed, and it was chiefly through her\r\nefforts that, in 1669, the persecution was brought to an end.  Madame de\r\nSablé co-operated with all her talent and interest in the same direction;\r\nbut here, as elsewhere, her influence was chiefly valuable in what she\r\nstimulated others to do, rather than in what she did herself.  It was by\r\nher that Madame de Longueville was first won to the cause of Port Royal;\r\nand we find this ardent brave woman constantly seeking the advice and\r\nsympathy of her more timid and self-indulgent, but sincere and judicious\r\nfriend.\r\n\r\nIn 1669, when Madame de Sablé had at length rest from these anxieties,\r\nshe was at the good old age of seventy, but she lived nine years\r\nlonger—years, we may suppose, chiefly dedicated to her spiritual\r\nconcerns.  This gradual, calm decay allayed the fear of death, which had\r\ntormented her more vigorous days; and she died with tranquillity and\r\ntrust.  It is a beautiful trait of these last moments that she desired\r\nnot to be buried with her family, or even at Port Royal, among her\r\nsaintly and noble companions—but in the cemetery of her parish, like one\r\nof the people, without pomp or ceremony.\r\n\r\nIt is worth while to notice, that with Madame de Sablé, as with some\r\nother remarkable French women, the part of her life which is richest in\r\ninterest and results is that which is looked forward to by most of her\r\nsex with melancholy as the period of decline.  When between fifty and\r\nsixty, she had philosophers, wits, beauties, and saints clustering around\r\nher; and one naturally cares to know what was the elixir which gave her\r\nthis enduring and general attraction.  We think it was, in a great\r\ndegree, that well-balanced development of mental powers which gave her a\r\ncomprehension of varied intellectual processes, and a tolerance for\r\nvaried forms of character, which is still rarer in women than in men.\r\nHere was one point of distinction between her and Madame de Longueville;\r\nand an amusing passage, which Sainte-Beuve has disinterred from the\r\nwritings of the Abbé St. Pierre, so well serves to indicate, by contrast,\r\nwhat we regard as the great charm of Madame de Sablé’s mind, that we\r\nshall not be wandering from our subject in quoting it.\r\n\r\n    “I one day asked M. Nicole what was the character of Mme. de\r\n    Longueville’s intellect; he told me it was very subtle and delicate\r\n    in the penetration of character; but very small, very feeble, and\r\n    that her comprehension was extremely narrow in matters of science and\r\n    reasoning, and on all speculations that did not concern matters of\r\n    sentiment.  For example, he added, I one day said to her that I could\r\n    wager and demonstrate that there were in Paris at least two\r\n    inhabitants who had the same number of hairs, although I could not\r\n    point out who these two men were.  She told me I could never be sure\r\n    of it until I had counted the hairs of these two men.  Here is my\r\n    demonstration, I said: I take it for granted that the head which is\r\n    most amply supplied with hairs has not more than 200,000, and the\r\n    head which is least so has but one hair.  Now, if you suppose that\r\n    200,000 heads have each a different number of hairs, it necessarily\r\n    follows that they have each one of the numbers of hairs which form\r\n    the series from one to 200,000; for if it were supposed that there\r\n    were two among these 200,000 who had the same number of hairs, I\r\n    should have gained my wager.  Supposing, then, that these 200,000\r\n    inhabitants have all a different number of hairs, if I add a single\r\n    inhabitant who has hairs, and who has not more than 200,000, it\r\n    necessarily follows that this number of hairs, whatever it may be,\r\n    will be contained in the series from one to 200,000, and consequently\r\n    will be equal to the number of hairs on one of the previous 200,000\r\n    inhabitants.  Now as, instead of one inhabitant more than 200,000,\r\n    there are nearly 800,000 inhabitants in Paris, you see clearly that\r\n    there must be many heads which have an equal number of hairs, though\r\n    I have not counted them.  Still Mme. de Longueville could never\r\n    comprehend that this equality of hairs could be demonstrated, and\r\n    always maintained that the only way of proving it was to count them.”\r\n\r\nSurely, the most ardent admirer of feminine shallowness must have felt\r\nsome irritation when he found himself arrested by this dead wall of\r\nstupidity, and have turned with relief to the larger intelligence of\r\nMadame de Sablé, who was not the less graceful, delicate, and feminine\r\nbecause she could follow a train of reasoning, or interest herself in a\r\nquestion of science.  In this combination consisted her pre-eminent\r\ncharm: she was not a genius, not a heroine, but a woman whom men could\r\nmore than love—whom they could make their friend, confidante, and\r\ncounsellor; the sharer, not of their joys and sorrows only, but of their\r\nideas and aims.\r\n\r\nSuch was Madame de Sablé, whose name is, perhaps, new to some of our\r\nreaders, so far does it lie from the surface of literature and history.\r\nWe have seen, too, that she was only one among a crowd—one in a firmament\r\nof feminine stars which, when once the biographical telescope is turned\r\nupon them, appear scarcely less remarkable and interesting.  Now, if the\r\nreader recollects what was the position and average intellectual\r\ncharacter of women in the high society of England during the reigns of\r\nJames the First and the two Charleses—the period through which Madame de\r\nSablé’s career extends—we think he will admit our position as to the\r\nearly superiority of womanly development in France, and this fact, with\r\nits causes, has not merely an historical interest: it has an important\r\nbearing on the culture of women in the present day.  Women become\r\nsuperior in France by being admitted to a common fund of ideas, to common\r\nobjects of interest with men; and this must ever be the essential\r\ncondition at once of true womanly culture and of true social well-being.\r\nWe have no faith in feminine conversazioni, where ladies are eloquent on\r\nApollo and Mars; though we sympathize with the yearning activity of\r\nfaculties which, deprived of their proper material, waste themselves in\r\nweaving fabrics out of cobwebs.  Let the whole field of reality be laid\r\nopen to woman as well as to man, and then that which is peculiar in her\r\nmental modification, instead of being, as it is now, a source of discord\r\nand repulsion between the sexes, will be found to be a necessary\r\ncomplement to the truth and beauty of life.  Then we shall have that\r\nmarriage of minds which alone can blend all the hues of thought and\r\nfeeling in one lovely rainbow of promise for the harvest of human\r\nhappiness.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIII.  EVANGELICAL TEACHING: DR. CUMMING. {64}\r\n\r\n\r\nGiven, a man with moderate intellect, a moral standard not higher than\r\nthe average, some rhetorical affluence and great glibness of speech, what\r\nis the career in which, without the aid of birth or money, he may most\r\neasily attain power and reputation in English society?  Where is that\r\nGoshen of mediocrity in which a smattering of science and learning will\r\npass for profound instruction, where platitudes will be accepted as\r\nwisdom, bigoted narrowness as holy zeal, unctuous egoism as God-given\r\npiety?  Let such a man become an evangelical preacher; he will then find\r\nit possible to reconcile small ability with great ambition, superficial\r\nknowledge with the prestige of erudition, a middling morale with a high\r\nreputation for sanctity.  Let him shun practical extremes and be ultra\r\nonly in what is purely theoretic; let him be stringent on predestination,\r\nbut latitudinarian on fasting; unflinching in insisting on the Eternity\r\nof punishment, but diffident of curtailing the substantial comforts of\r\nTime; ardent and imaginative on the pro-millennial advent of Christ, but\r\ncold and cautious toward every other infringement of the _status quo_.\r\nLet him fish for souls not with the bait of inconvenient singularity, but\r\nwith the drag-net of comfortable conformity.  Let him be hard and literal\r\nin his interpretation only when he wants to hurl texts at the heads of\r\nunbelievers and adversaries, but when the letter of the Scriptures\r\npresses too closely on the genteel Christianity of the nineteenth\r\ncentury, let him use his spiritualizing alembic and disperse it into\r\nimpalpable ether.  Let him preach less of Christ than of Antichrist; let\r\nhim be less definite in showing what sin is than in showing who is the\r\nMan of Sin, less expansive on the blessedness of faith than on the\r\naccursedness of infidelity.  Above all, let him set up as an interpreter\r\nof prophecy, and rival Moore’s Almanack in the prediction of political\r\nevents, tickling the interest of hearers who are but moderately spiritual\r\nby showing how the Holy Spirit has dictated problems and charades for\r\ntheir benefit, and how, if they are ingenious enough to solve these, they\r\nmay have their Christian graces nourished by learning precisely to whom\r\nthey may point as the “horn that had eyes,” “the lying prophet,” and the\r\n“unclean spirits.”  In this way he will draw men to him by the strong\r\ncords of their passions, made reason-proof by being baptized with the\r\nname of piety.  In this way he may gain a metropolitan pulpit; the\r\navenues to his church will be as crowded as the passages to the opera; he\r\nhas but to print his prophetic sermons and bind them in lilac and gold,\r\nand they will adorn the drawing-room table of all evangelical ladies, who\r\nwill regard as a sort of pious “light reading” the demonstration that the\r\nprophecy of the locusts whose sting is in their tail, is fulfilled in the\r\nfact of the Turkish commander’s having taken a horse’s tail for his\r\nstandard, and that the French are the very frogs predicted in the\r\nRevelations.\r\n\r\nPleasant to the clerical flesh under such circumstances is the arrival of\r\nSunday!  Somewhat at a disadvantage during the week, in the presence of\r\nworking-day interests and lay splendors, on Sunday the preacher becomes\r\nthe cynosure of a thousand eyes, and predominates at once over the\r\nAmphitryon with whom he dines, and the most captious member of his church\r\nor vestry.  He has an immense advantage over all other public speakers.\r\nThe platform orator is subject to the criticism of hisses and groans.\r\nCounsel for the plaintiff expects the retort of counsel for the\r\ndefendant.  The honorable gentleman on one side of the House is liable to\r\nhave his facts and figures shown up by his honorable friend on the\r\nopposite side.  Even the scientific or literary lecturer, if he is dull\r\nor incompetent, may see the best part of his audience quietly slip out\r\none by one.  But the preacher is completely master of the situation: no\r\none may hiss, no one may depart.  Like the writer of imaginary\r\nconversations, he may put what imbecilities he pleases into the mouths of\r\nhis antagonists, and swell with triumph when he has refuted them.  He may\r\nriot in gratuitous assertions, confident that no man will contradict him;\r\nhe may exercise perfect free-will in logic, and invent illustrative\r\nexperience; he may give an evangelical edition of history with the\r\ninconvenient facts omitted:—all this he may do with impunity, certain\r\nthat those of his hearers who are not sympathizing are not listening.\r\nFor the Press has no band of critics who go the round of the churches and\r\nchapels, and are on the watch for a slip or defect in the preacher, to\r\nmake a “feature” in their article: the clergy are, practically, the most\r\nirresponsible of all talkers.  For this reason, at least, it is well that\r\nthey do not always allow their discourses to be merely fugitive, but are\r\noften induced to fix them in that black and white in which they are open\r\nto the criticism of any man who has the courage and patience to treat\r\nthem with thorough freedom of speech and pen.\r\n\r\nIt is because we think this criticism of clerical teaching desirable for\r\nthe public good that we devote some pages to Dr. Cumming.  He is, as\r\nevery one knows, a preacher of immense popularity, and of the numerous\r\npublications in which he perpetuates his pulpit labors, all circulate\r\nwidely, and some, according to their title-page, have reached the\r\nsixteenth thousand.  Now our opinion of these publications is the very\r\nopposite of that given by a newspaper eulogist: we do _not_ “believe that\r\nthe repeated issues of Dr. Cumming’s thoughts are having a beneficial\r\neffect on society,” but the reverse; and hence, little inclined as we are\r\nto dwell on his pages, we think it worth while to do so, for the sake of\r\npointing out in them what we believe to be profoundly mistaken and\r\npernicious.  Of Dr. Cumming personally we know absolutely nothing: our\r\nacquaintance with him is confined to a perusal of his works, our judgment\r\nof him is founded solely on the manner in which he has written himself\r\ndown on his pages.  We know neither how he looks nor how he lives.  We\r\nare ignorant whether, like St. Paul, he has a bodily presence that is\r\nweak and contemptible, or whether his person is as florid and as prone to\r\namplification as his style.  For aught we know, he may not only have the\r\ngift of prophecy, but may bestow the profits of all his works to feed the\r\npoor, and be ready to give his own body to be burned with as much\r\nalacrity as he infers the everlasting burning of Roman Catholics and\r\nPuseyites.  Out of the pulpit he may be a model of justice, truthfulness,\r\nand the love that thinketh no evil; but we are obliged to judge of his\r\ncharity by the spirit we find in his sermons, and shall only be glad to\r\nlearn that his practice is, in many respects, an amiable _non sequitur_\r\nfrom his teaching.\r\n\r\nDr. Cumming’s mind is evidently not of the pietistic order.  There is not\r\nthe slightest leaning toward mysticism in his Christianity—no indication\r\nof religious raptures, of delight in God, of spiritual communion with the\r\nFather.  He is most at home in the forensic view of Justification, and\r\ndwells on salvation as a scheme rather than as an experience.  He insists\r\non good works as the sign of justifying faith, as labors to be achieved\r\nto the glory of God, but he rarely represents them as the spontaneous,\r\nnecessary outflow of a soul filled with Divine love.  He is at home in\r\nthe external, the polemical, the historical, the circumstantial, and is\r\nonly episodically devout and practical.  The great majority of his\r\npublished sermons are occupied with argument or philippic against\r\nRomanists and unbelievers, with “vindications” of the Bible, with the\r\npolitical interpretation of prophecy, or the criticism of public events;\r\nand the devout aspiration, or the spiritual and practical exhortation, is\r\ntacked to them as a sort of fringe in a hurried sentence or two at the\r\nend.  He revels in the demonstration that the Pope is the Man of Sin; he\r\nis copious on the downfall of the Ottoman empire; he appears to glow with\r\nsatisfaction in turning a story which tends to show how he abashed an\r\n“infidel;” it is a favorite exercise with him to form conjectures of the\r\nprocess by which the earth is to be burned up, and to picture Dr.\r\nChalmers and Mr. Wilberforce being caught up to meet Christ in the air,\r\nwhile Romanists, Puseyites, and infidels are given over to gnashing of\r\nteeth.  But of really spiritual joys and sorrows, of the life and death\r\nof Christ as a manifestation of love that constrains the soul, of\r\nsympathy with that yearning over the lost and erring which made Jesus\r\nweep over Jerusalem, and prompted the sublime prayer, “Father, forgive\r\nthem,” of the gentler fruits of the Spirit, and the peace of God which\r\npasseth understanding—of all this, we find little trace in Dr. Cumming’s\r\ndiscourses.\r\n\r\nHis style is in perfect correspondence with this habit of mind.  Though\r\ndiffuse, as that of all preachers must be, it has rapidity of movement,\r\nperfect clearness, and some aptness of illustration.  He has much of that\r\nliterary talent which makes a good journalist—the power of beating out an\r\nidea over a large space, and of introducing far-fetched _à propos_.  His\r\nwritings have, indeed, no high merit: they have no originality or force\r\nof thought, no striking felicity of presentation, no depth of emotion.\r\nThroughout nine volumes we have alighted on no passage which impressed us\r\nas worth extracting, and placing among the “beauties,” of evangelical\r\nwriters, such as Robert Hall, Foster the Essayist, or Isaac Taylor.\r\nEverywhere there is commonplace cleverness, nowhere a spark of rare\r\nthought, of lofty sentiment, or pathetic tenderness.  We feel ourselves\r\nin company with a voluble retail talker, whose language is exuberant but\r\nnot exact, and to whom we should never think of referring for precise\r\ninformation or for well-digested thought and experience.  His argument\r\ncontinually slides into wholesale assertion and vague declamation, and in\r\nhis love of ornament he frequently becomes tawdry.  For example, he tells\r\nus (“Apoc. Sketches,” p. 265) that “Botany weaves around the cross her\r\namaranthine garlands; and Newton comes from his starry home—Linnæus from\r\nhis flowery resting-place—and Werner and Hutton from their subterranean\r\ngraves at the voice of Chalmers, to acknowledge that all they learned and\r\nelicited in their respective provinces has only served to show more\r\nclearly that Jesus of Nazareth is enthroned on the riches of the\r\nuniverse:”—and so prosaic an injunction to his hearers as that they\r\nshould choose a residence within an easy distance of church, is\r\nmagnificently draped by him as an exhortation to prefer a house “that\r\nbasks in the sunshine of the countenance of God.”  Like all preachers of\r\nhis class, he is more fertile in imaginative paraphrase than in close\r\nexposition, and in this way he gives us some remarkable fragments of what\r\nwe may call the romance of Scripture, filling up the outline of the\r\nrecord with an elaborate coloring quite undreamed of by more literal\r\nminds.  The serpent, he informs us, said to Eve, “Can it be so?  Surely\r\nyou are mistaken, that God hath said you shall die, a creature so fair,\r\nso lovely, so beautiful.  It is impossible.  _The laws of nature and\r\nphysical science tell you that my interpretation is correct_; you shall\r\nnot die.  I can tell you by my own experience as an angel that you shall\r\nbe as gods, knowing good and evil.”  (“Apoc. Sketches,” p. 294.)  Again,\r\naccording to Dr. Cumming, Abel had so clear an idea of the Incarnation\r\nand Atonement, that when he offered his sacrifice “he must have said, ‘I\r\nfeel myself a guilty sinner, and that in myself I cannot meet thee alive;\r\nI lay on thine altar this victim, and I shed its blood as my testimony\r\nthat mine should be shed; and I look for forgiveness and undeserved mercy\r\nthrough him who is to bruise the serpent’s head, and whose atonement this\r\ntypifies.’”  (“Occas. Disc.” vol. i. p. 23.)  Indeed, his productions are\r\nessentially ephemeral; he is essentially a journalist, who writes sermons\r\ninstead of leading articles, who, instead of venting diatribes against\r\nher Majesty’s Ministers, directs his power of invective against Cardinal\r\nWiseman and the Puseyites; instead of declaiming on public spirit,\r\nperorates on the “glory of God.”  We fancy he is called, in the more\r\nrefined evangelical circles, an “intellectual preacher;” by the plainer\r\nsort of Christians, a “flowery preacher;” and we are inclined to think\r\nthat the more spiritually minded class of believers, who look with\r\ngreater anxiety for the kingdom of God within them than for the visible\r\nadvent of Christ in 1864, will be likely to find Dr. Cumming’s\r\ndeclamatory flights and historico-prophetical exercitations as little\r\nbetter than “clouts o’ cauld parritch.”\r\n\r\nSuch is our general impression from his writings after an attentive\r\nperusal.  There are some particular characteristics which we shall\r\nconsider more closely, but in doing so we must be understood as\r\naltogether declining any doctrinal discussion.  We have no intention to\r\nconsider the grounds of Dr. Cumming’s dogmatic system, to examine the\r\nprinciples of his prophetic exegesis, or to question his opinion\r\nconcerning the little horn, the river Euphrates, or the seven vials.  We\r\nidentify ourselves with no one of the bodies whom he regards it as his\r\nspecial mission to attack: we give our adhesion neither to Romanism,\r\nPuseyism, nor to that anomalous combination of opinions which he\r\nintroduces to us under the name of infidelity.  It is simply as\r\nspectators that we criticise Dr. Cumming’s mode of warfare, and we\r\nconcern ourselves less with what he holds to be Christian truth than with\r\nhis manner of enforcing that truth, less with the doctrines he teaches\r\nthan with the moral spirit and tendencies of his teaching.\r\n\r\nOne of the most striking characteristics of Dr. Cumming’s writings is\r\n_unscrupulosity of statement_.  His motto apparently is,\r\n_Christianitatem_, _quocunque modo_, _Christianitatem_; and the only\r\nsystem he includes under the term Christianity is Calvinistic\r\nProtestantism.  Experience has so long shown that the human brain is a\r\ncongenial nidus for inconsistent beliefs that we do not pause to inquire\r\nhow Dr. Cumming, who attributes the conversion of the unbelieving to the\r\nDivine Spirit, can think it necessary to co-operate with that Spirit by\r\nargumentative white lies.  Nor do we for a moment impugn the genuineness\r\nof his zeal for Christianity, or the sincerity of his conviction that the\r\ndoctrines he preaches are necessary to salvation; on the contrary, we\r\nregard the flagrant unveracity that we find on his pages as an indirect\r\nresult of that conviction—as a result, namely, of the intellectual and\r\nmoral distortion of view which is inevitably produced by assigning to\r\ndogmas, based on a very complex structure of evidence, the place and\r\nauthority of first truths.  A distinct appreciation of the value of\r\nevidence—in other words, the intellectual perception of truth—is more\r\nclosely allied to truthfulness of statement, or the moral quality of\r\nveracity, than is generally admitted.  There is not a more pernicious\r\nfallacy afloat, in common parlance, than the wide distinction made\r\nbetween intellect and morality.  Amiable impulses without intellect, man\r\nmay have in common with dogs and horses; but morality, which is\r\nspecifically human, is dependent on the regulation of feeling by\r\nintellect.  All human beings who can be said to be in any degree moral\r\nhave their impulses guided, not indeed always by their own intellect, but\r\nby the intellect of human beings who have gone before them, and created\r\ntraditions and associations which have taken the rank of laws.  Now that\r\nhighest moral habit, the constant preference of truth, both theoretically\r\nand practically, pre-eminently demands the co-operation of the intellect\r\nwith the impulses, as is indicated by the fact that it is only found in\r\nanything like completeness in the highest class of minds.  In accordance\r\nwith this we think it is found that, in proportion as religious sects\r\nexalt feeling above intellect, and believe themselves to be guided by\r\ndirect inspiration rather than by a spontaneous exertion of their\r\nfaculties—that is, in proportion as they are removed from\r\nrationalism—their sense of truthfulness is misty and confused.  No one\r\ncan have talked to the more enthusiastic Methodists and listened to their\r\nstories of miracles without perceiving that they require no other\r\npassport to a statement than that it accords with their wishes and their\r\ngeneral conception of God’s dealings; nay, they regard as a symptom of\r\nsinful scepticism an inquiry into the evidence for a story which they\r\nthink unquestionably tends to the glory of God, and in retailing such\r\nstories, new particulars, further tending to his glory, are “borne in”\r\nupon their minds.  Now, Dr. Cumming, as we have said, is no enthusiastic\r\npietist: within a certain circle—within the mill of evangelical\r\northodoxy—his intellect is perpetually at work; but that principle of\r\nsophistication which our friends the Methodists derive from the\r\npredominance of their pietistic feelings, is involved for him in the\r\ndoctrine of verbal inspiration; what is for them a state of emotion\r\nsubmerging the intellect, is with him a formula imprisoning the\r\nintellect, depriving it of its proper function—the free search for\r\ntruth—and making it the mere servant-of-all-work to a foregone\r\nconclusion.  Minds fettered by this doctrine no longer inquire concerning\r\na proposition whether it is attested by sufficient evidence, but whether\r\nit accords with Scripture; they do not search for facts, as such, but for\r\nfacts that will bear out their doctrine.  They become accustomed to\r\nreject the more direct evidence in favor of the less direct, and where\r\nadverse evidence reaches demonstration they must resort to devices and\r\nexpedients in order to explain away contradiction.  It is easy to see\r\nthat this mental habit blunts not only the perception of truth, but the\r\nsense of truthfulness, and that the man whose faith drives him into\r\nfallacies treads close upon the precipice of falsehood.\r\n\r\nWe have entered into this digression for the sake of mitigating the\r\ninference that is likely to be drawn from that characteristic of Dr.\r\nCumming’s works to which we have pointed.  He is much in the same\r\nintellectual condition as that professor of Padua; who, in order to\r\ndisprove Galileo’s discovery of Jupiter’s satellites, urged that as there\r\nwere only seven metals there could not be more than seven planets—a\r\nmental condition scarcely compatible with candor.  And we may well\r\nsuppose that if the professor had held the belief in seven planets, and\r\nno more, to be a necessary condition of salvation, his mental condition\r\nwould have been so dazed that even if he had consented to look through\r\nGalileo’s telescope, his eyes would have reported in accordance with his\r\ninward alarms rather than with the external fact.  So long as a belief in\r\npropositions is regarded as indispensable to salvation, the pursuit of\r\ntruth _as such_ is not possible, any more than it is possible for a man\r\nwho is swimming for his life to make meteorological observations on the\r\nstorm which threatens to overwhelm him.  The sense of alarm and haste,\r\nthe anxiety for personal safety, which Dr. Cumming insists upon as the\r\nproper religious attitude, unmans the nature, and allows no thorough,\r\ncalm thinking no truly noble, disinterested feeling.  Hence, we by no\r\nmeans suspect that the unscrupulosity of statement with which we charge\r\nDr. Cumming, extends beyond the sphere of his theological prejudices; we\r\ndo not doubt that, religion apart, he appreciates and practices veracity.\r\n\r\nA grave general accusation must be supported by details, and in adducing\r\nthose we purposely select the most obvious cases of\r\nmisrepresentation—such as require no argument to expose them, but can be\r\nperceived at a glance.  Among Dr. Cumming’s numerous books, one of the\r\nmost notable for unscrupulosity of statement is the “Manual of Christian\r\nEvidences,” written, as he tells us in his Preface, not to give the\r\ndeepest solutions of the difficulties in question, but to furnish\r\nScripture Readers, City Missionaries, and Sunday School Teachers, with a\r\n“ready reply” to sceptical arguments.  This announcement that _readiness_\r\nwas the chief quality sought for in the solutions here given, modifies\r\nour inference from the other qualities which those solutions present; and\r\nit is but fair to presume that when the Christian disputant is not in a\r\nhurry Dr. Cumming would recommend replies less ready and more veracious.\r\nHere is an example of what in another place {74} he tells his readers is\r\n“change in their pocket . . . a little ready argument which they can\r\nemploy, and therewith answer a fool according to his folly.”  From the\r\nnature of this argumentative small coin, we are inclined to think Dr.\r\nCumming understands answering a fool according to his folly to mean,\r\ngiving him a foolish answer.  We quote from the “Manual of Christian\r\nEvidences,” p. 62.\r\n\r\n    “Some of the gods which the heathen worshipped were among the\r\n    greatest monsters that ever walked the earth.  Mercury was a thief;\r\n    and because he was an expert thief he was enrolled among the gods.\r\n    Bacchus was a mere sensualist and drunkard, and therefore he was\r\n    enrolled among the gods.  Venus was a dissipated and abandoned\r\n    courtesan, and therefore she was enrolled among the goddesses.  Mars\r\n    was a savage, that gloried in battle and in blood, and therefore he\r\n    was deified and enrolled among the gods.”\r\n\r\nDoes Dr. Cumming believe the purport of these sentences?  If so, this\r\npassage is worth handing down as his theory of the Greek myth—as a\r\nspecimen of the astounding ignorance which was possible in a metropolitan\r\npreacher, A.D. 1854.  And if he does not believe them . . . The inference\r\nmust then be, that he thinks delicate veracity about the ancient Greeks\r\nis not a Christian virtue, but only a “splendid sin” of the unregenerate.\r\nThis inference is rendered the more probable by our finding, a little\r\nfurther on, that he is not more scrupulous about the moderns, if they\r\ncome under his definition of “Infidels.”  But the passage we are about to\r\nquote in proof of this has a worse quality than its discrepancy with\r\nfact.  Who that has a spark of generous feeling, that rejoices in the\r\npresence of good in a fellow-being, has not dwelt with pleasure on the\r\nthought that Lord Byron’s unhappy career was ennobled and purified toward\r\nits close by a high and sympathetic purpose, by honest and energetic\r\nefforts for his fellow-men?  Who has not read with deep emotion those\r\nlast pathetic lines, beautiful as the after-glow of sunset, in which love\r\nand resignation are mingled with something of a melancholy heroism?  Who\r\nhas not lingered with compassion over the dying scene at Missolonghi—the\r\nsufferer’s inability to make his farewell messages of love intelligible,\r\nand the last long hours of silent pain?  Yet for the sake of furnishing\r\nhis disciples with a “ready reply,” Dr. Cumming can prevail on himself to\r\ninoculate them with a bad-spirited falsity like the following:\r\n\r\n    “We have one striking exhibition of _an infidel’s brightest\r\n    thoughts_, in some lines _written in his dying moments_ by a man,\r\n    gifted with great genius, capable of prodigious intellectual prowess,\r\n    but of worthless principle, and yet more worthless practices—I mean\r\n    the celebrated Lord Byron.  He says:\r\n\r\n    “‘Though gay companions o’er the bowl\r\n       Dispel awhile the sense of ill,\r\n    Though pleasure fills the maddening soul,\r\n       The heart—_the heart_ is lonely still.\r\n\r\n    “‘Ay, but to die, and go, alas!\r\n       Where all have gone and all must go;\r\n    To be the _Nothing_ that I was,\r\n       Ere born to life and living woe!\r\n\r\n    “‘Count o’er the joys thine hours have seen,\r\n       Count o’er thy days from anguish free,\r\n    And know, whatever thou hast been,\r\n       Tis _something better_ not to be.\r\n\r\n    “‘Nay, for myself, so dark my fate\r\n       Through every turn of life hath been,\r\n    _Man_ and the _world_ so much _I hate_,\r\n       I care not when I quit the scene.’”\r\n\r\nIt is difficult to suppose that Dr. Cumming can have been so grossly\r\nimposed upon—that he can be so ill-informed as really to believe that\r\nthese lines were “written” by Lord Byron in his dying moments; but,\r\nallowing him the full benefit of that possibility, how shall we explain\r\nhis introduction of this feebly rabid doggrel as “an infidel’s brightest\r\nthoughts?”\r\n\r\nIn marshalling the evidences of Christianity, Dr. Cumming directs most of\r\nhis arguments against opinions that are either totally imaginary, or that\r\nbelong to the past rather than to the present, while he entirely fails to\r\nmeet the difficulties actually felt and urged by those who are unable to\r\naccept Revelation.  There can hardly be a stronger proof of misconception\r\nas to the character of free-thinking in the present day, than the\r\nrecommendation of Leland’s “Short and Easy Method with the Deists”—a\r\nmethod which is unquestionably short and easy for preachers disinclined\r\nto reconsider their stereotyped modes of thinking and arguing, but which\r\nhas quite ceased to realize those epithets in the conversion of Deists.\r\nYet Dr. Cumming not only recommends this book, but takes the trouble\r\nhimself to write a feebler version of its arguments.  For example, on the\r\nquestion of the genuineness and authenticity of the New Testament\r\nwriting’s, he says: “If, therefore, at a period long subsequent to the\r\ndeath of Christ, a number of men had appeared in the world, drawn up a\r\nbook which they christened by the name of the Holy Scripture, and\r\nrecorded these things which appear in it as facts when they were only the\r\nfancies of their own imagination, surely the _Jews_ would have instantly\r\nreclaimed that no such events transpired, that no such person as Jesus\r\nChrist appeared in their capital, and that _their_ crucifixion of Him,\r\nand their alleged evil treatment of his apostles, were mere fictions.”\r\n{76}  It is scarcely necessary to say that, in such argument as this, Dr.\r\nCumming is beating the air.  He is meeting a hypothesis which no one\r\nholds, and totally missing the real question.  The only type of “infidel”\r\nwhose existence Dr. Cumming recognizes is that fossil personage who\r\n“calls the Bible a lie and a forgery.”  He seems to be ignorant—or he\r\nchooses to ignore the fact—that there is a large body of eminently\r\ninstructed and earnest men who regard the Hebrew and Christian Scriptures\r\nas a series of historical documents, to be dealt with according to the\r\nrules of historical criticism, and that an equally large number of men,\r\nwho are not historical critics, find the dogmatic scheme built on the\r\nletter of the Scriptures opposed to their profoundest moral convictions.\r\nDr. Cumming’s infidel is a man who, because his life is vicious, tries to\r\nconvince himself that there is no God, and that Christianity is an\r\nimposture, but who is all the while secretly conscious that he is\r\nopposing the truth, and cannot help “letting out” admissions “that the\r\nBible is the Book of God.”  We are favored with the following “Creed of\r\nthe Infidel:”\r\n\r\n    “I believe that there is no God, but that matter is God, and God is\r\n    matter; and that it is no matter whether there is any God or not.  I\r\n    believe also that the world was not made, but that the world made\r\n    itself, or that it had no beginning, and that it will last forever.\r\n    I believe that man is a beast; that the soul is the body, and that\r\n    the body is the soul; and that after death there is neither body nor\r\n    soul.  I believe there is no religion, that _natural religion is the\r\n    only religion_, _and all religion unnatural_.  I believe not in\r\n    Moses; I believe in the first philosophers.  I believe not in the\r\n    evangelists; I believe in Chubb, Collins, Toland, Tindal, and Hobbes.\r\n    I believe in Lord Bolingbroke, and I believe not in St. Paul.  I\r\n    believe not in revelation; _I believe in tradition_; _I believe in\r\n    the Talmud_; _I believe in the Koran_; I believe not in the Bible.  I\r\n    believe in Socrates; I believe in Confucius; I believe in Mahomet; I\r\n    believe not in Christ.  And lastly, _I believe_ in all unbelief.”\r\n\r\nThe intellectual and moral monster whose creed is this complex web of\r\ncontradictions, is, moreover, according to Dr. Cumming, a being who\r\nunites much simplicity and imbecility with his Satanic hardihood—much\r\ntenderness of conscience with his obdurate vice.  Hear the “proof:”\r\n\r\n    “I once met with an acute and enlightened infidel, with whom I\r\n    reasoned day after day, and for hours together; I submitted to him\r\n    the internal, the external, and the experimental evidences, but made\r\n    no impression on his scorn and unbelief.  At length I entertained a\r\n    suspicion that there was something morally, rather than\r\n    intellectually wrong, and that the bias was not in the intellect, but\r\n    in the heart; one day therefore I said to him, ‘I must now state my\r\n    conviction, and you may call me uncharitable, but duty compels me;\r\n    you are living in some known and gross sin.’  _The man’s countenance\r\n    became pale_; _he bowed and left me_.”—“Man. of Evidences,” p. 254.\r\n\r\nHere we have the remarkable psychological phenomenon of an “acute and\r\nenlightened” man who, deliberately purposing to indulge in a favorite\r\nsin, and regarding the Gospel with scorn and unbelief, is, nevertheless,\r\nso much more scrupulous than the majority of Christians, that he cannot\r\n“embrace sin and the Gospel simultaneously;” who is so alarmed at the\r\nGospel in which he does not believe, that he cannot be easy without\r\ntrying to crush it; whose acuteness and enlightenment suggest to him, as\r\na means of crushing the Gospel, to argue from day to day with Dr.\r\nCumming; and who is withal so naïve that he is taken by surprise when Dr.\r\nCumming, failing in argument, resorts to accusation, and so tender in\r\nconscience that, at the mention of his sin, he turns pale and leaves the\r\nspot.  If there be any human mind in existence capable of holding Dr.\r\nCumming’s “Creed of the Infidel,” of at the same time believing in\r\ntradition and “believing in all unbelief,” it must be the mind of the\r\ninfidel just described, for whose existence we have Dr. Cumming’s _ex\r\nofficio_ word as a theologian; and to theologians we may apply what\r\nSancho Panza says of the bachelors of Salamanca, that they never tell\r\nlies—except when it suits their purpose.\r\n\r\nThe total absence from Dr. Cumming’s theological mind of any demarcation\r\nbetween fact and rhetoric is exhibited in another passage, where he\r\nadopts the dramatic form:\r\n\r\n    “Ask the peasant on the hills—and _I have asked amid the mountains of\r\n    Braemar and Deeside_—‘How do you know that this book is divine, and\r\n    that the religion you profess is true?  You never read Paley?’  ‘No,\r\n    I never heard of him.’—‘You have never read Butler?’  ‘No, I have\r\n    never heard of him.’—‘Nor Chalmers?’  ‘No, I do not know him.’—‘You\r\n    have never read any books on evidence?’  ‘No, I have read no such\r\n    books.’—‘Then, how do you know this book is true?’  ‘Know it!  Tell\r\n    me that the Dee, the Clunie, and the Garrawalt, the streams at my\r\n    feet, do not run; that the winds do not sigh amid the gorges of these\r\n    blue hills; that the sun does not kindle the peaks of Loch-na-Gar;\r\n    tell me my heart does not beat, and I will believe you; but do not\r\n    tell me the Bible is not divine.  I have found its truth illuminating\r\n    my footsteps; its consolations sustaining my heart.  May my tongue\r\n    cleave to my mouth’s roof and my right hand forget its cunning, if I\r\n    every deny what is my deepest inner experience, that this blessed\r\n    book is the book of God.’”—“Church Before the Flood,” p. 35.\r\n\r\nDr. Cumming is so slippery and lax in his mode of presentation that we\r\nfind it impossible to gather whether he means to assert that this is what\r\na peasant on the mountains of Braemar _did_ say, or that it is what such\r\na peasant _would_ say: in the one case, the passage may be taken as a\r\nmeasure of his truthfulness; in the other, of his judgment.\r\n\r\nHis own faith, apparently, has not been altogether intuitive, like that\r\nof his rhetorical peasant, for he tells us (“Apoc. Sketches,” p. 405)\r\nthat he has himself experienced what it is to have religious doubts.  “I\r\nwas tainted while at the University by this spirit of scepticism.  I\r\nthought Christianity might not be true.  The very possibility of its\r\nbeing true was the thought I felt I must meet and settle.  Conscience\r\ncould give me no peace till I had settled it.  I read, and I read from\r\nthat day, for fourteen or fifteen years, till this, and now I am as\r\nconvinced, upon the clearest evidence, that this book is the book of God\r\nas that I now address you.”  This experience, however, instead of\r\nimpressing on him the fact that doubt may be the stamp of a truth-loving\r\nmind—that _sunt quibus non credidisse honor est_, _et fidei futuræ\r\npignus_—seems to have produced precisely the contrary effect.  It has not\r\nenabled him even to conceive the condition of a mind “perplext in faith\r\nbut pure in deeds,” craving light, yearning for a faith that will\r\nharmonize and cherish its highest powers and aspirations, but unable to\r\nfind that faith in dogmatic Christianity.  His own doubts apparently were\r\nof a different kind.  Nowhere in his pages have we found a humble,\r\ncandid, sympathetic attempt to meet the difficulties that may be felt by\r\nan ingenuous mind.  Everywhere he supposes that the doubter is hardened,\r\nconceited, consciously shutting his eyes to the light—a fool who is to be\r\nanswered according to his folly—that is, with ready replies made up of\r\nreckless assertions, of apocryphal anecdotes, and, where other resources\r\nfail, of vituperative imputation.  As to the reading which he has\r\nprosecuted for fifteen years—_either_ it has left him totally ignorant of\r\nthe relation which his own religions creed bears to the criticism and\r\nphilosophy of the nineteenth century, or he systematically blinks that\r\ncriticism and that philosophy; and instead of honestly and seriously\r\nendeavoring to meet and solve what he knows to be the real difficulties,\r\ncontents himself with setting up popinjays to shoot at, for the sake of\r\nconfirming the ignorance and winning the heap admiration of his\r\nevangelical hearers and readers.  Like the Catholic preacher who, after\r\nthrowing down his cap and apostrophizing it as Luther, turned to his\r\naudience and said, “You see this heretical fellow has not a word to say\r\nfor himself,” Dr. Cumming, having drawn his ugly portrait of the infidel,\r\nand put arguments of a convenient quality into his mouth, finds a “short\r\nand easy method” of confounding this “croaking frog.”\r\n\r\nIn his treatment of infidels, we imagine he is guided by a mental process\r\nwhich may be expressed in the following syllogism: Whatever tends to the\r\nglory of God is true; it is for the glory of God that infidels should be\r\nas bad as possible; therefore, whatever tends to show that infidels are\r\nas bad as possible is true.  All infidels, he tells us, have been men of\r\n“gross and licentious lives.”  Is there not some well-known unbeliever,\r\nDavid Hume, for example, of whom even Dr. Cumming’s readers may have\r\nheard as an exception?  No matter.  Some one suspected that he was _not_\r\nan exception, and as that suspicion tends to the glory of God, it is one\r\nfor a Christian to entertain.  (See “Man. of Ev.,” p. 73.)—If we were\r\nunable to imagine this kind of self-sophistication, we should be obliged\r\nto suppose that, relying on the ignorance of his evangelical disciples,\r\nhe fed them with direct and conscious falsehoods.  “Voltaire,” he informs\r\nthem, “declares there is no God;” he was “an antitheist, that is one who\r\ndeliberately and avowedly opposed and hated God; who swore in his\r\nblasphemy that he would dethrone him;” and “advocated the very depths of\r\nthe lowest sensuality.”  With regard to many statements of a similar\r\nkind, equally at variance with truth, in Dr. Cumming’s volumes, we\r\npresume that he has been misled by hearsay or by the second-hand\r\ncharacter of his acquaintance with free-thinking literature.  An\r\nevangelical preacher is not obliged to be well-read.  Here, however, is a\r\ncase which the extremest supposition of educated ignorance will not\r\nreach.  Even books of “evidences” quote from Voltaire the line—\r\n\r\n    “Si Dieu n’existait pas, il faudrait l’inventer;”\r\n\r\neven persons fed on the mere whey and buttermilk of literature must know\r\nthat in philosophy Voltaire was nothing if not a theist—must know that he\r\nwrote not against God, but against Jehovah, the God of the Jews, whom he\r\nbelieved to be a false God—must know that to say Voltaire was an atheist\r\non this ground is as absurd as to say that a Jacobite opposed hereditary\r\nmonarchy because he declared the Brunswick family had no title to the\r\nthrone.  That Dr. Cumming should repeat the vulgar fables about\r\nVoltaire’s death is merely what we might expect from the specimens we\r\nhave seen of his illustrative stories.  A man whose accounts of his own\r\nexperience are apocryphal is not likely to put borrowed narratives to any\r\nsevere test.\r\n\r\nThe alliance between intellectual and moral perversion is strikingly\r\ntypified by the way in which he alternates from the unveracious to the\r\nabsurd, from misrepresentation to contradiction.  Side by side with the\r\nabduction of “facts” such as those we have quoted, we find him arguing on\r\none page that the Trinity was too grand a doctrine to have been conceived\r\nby man, and was _therefore_ Divine; and on another page, that the\r\nIncarnation _had_ been preconceived by man, and is _therefore_ to be\r\naccepted as Divine.  But we are less concerned with the fallacy of his\r\n“ready replies” than with their falsity; and even of this we can only\r\nafford space for a very few specimens.  Here is one: “There is a\r\n_thousand times_ more proof that the gospel of John was written by him\r\nthan there is that the _Αναβασις_ was written by Xenophon, or the Ars\r\nPoetica by Horace.”  If Dr. Cumming had chosen Plato’s Epistles or\r\nAnacreon’s Poems instead of the Anabasis or the Ars Poetica, he would\r\nhave reduced the extent of the falsehood, and would have furnished a\r\nready reply which would have been equally effective with his\r\nSunday-school teachers and their disputants.  Hence we conclude this\r\nprodigality of misstatement, this exuberance of mendacity, is an\r\neffervescence of zeal _in majorem gloriam Dei_.  Elsewhere he tells us\r\nthat “the idea of the author of the ‘Vestiges’ is, that man is the\r\ndevelopment of a monkey, that the monkey is the embryo man, so that _if\r\nyou keep a baboon long enough_, _it will develop itself into a man_.”\r\nHow well Dr. Cumming has qualified himself to judge of the ideas in “that\r\nvery unphilosophical book,” as he pronounces it, may be inferred from the\r\nfact that he implies the author of the “Vestiges” to have _originated_\r\nthe nebular hypothesis.\r\n\r\nIn the volume from which the last extract is taken, even the hardihood of\r\nassertion is surpassed by the suicidal character of the argument.  It is\r\ncalled “The Church before the Flood,” and is devoted chiefly to the\r\nadjustment of the question between the Bible and Geology.  Keeping within\r\nthe limits we have prescribed to ourselves, we do not enter into the\r\nmatter of this discussion; we merely pause a little over the volume in\r\norder to point out Dr. Cumming’s mode of treating the question.  He first\r\ntells us that “the Bible has not a single scientific error in it;” that\r\n“_its slightest intimations of scientific principles or natural phenomena\r\nhave in every instance been demonstrated to be exactly and strictly\r\ntrue_,” and he asks:\r\n\r\n    “How is it that Moses, with no greater education than the Hindoo or\r\n    the ancient philosopher, has written his book, touching science at a\r\n    thousand points, so accurately that scientific research has\r\n    discovered no flaws in it; and yet in those investigations which have\r\n    taken place in more recent centuries, it has not been shown that he\r\n    has committed one single error, or made one solitary assertion which\r\n    can be proved by the maturest science, or by the most eagle-eyed\r\n    philosopher, to be incorrect, scientifically or historically?”\r\n\r\nAccording to this the relation of the Bible to science should be one of\r\nthe strong points of apologists for revelation: the scientific accuracy\r\nof Moses should stand at the head of their evidences; and they might urge\r\nwith some cogency, that since Aristotle, who devoted himself to science,\r\nand lived many ages after Moses, does little else than err ingeniously,\r\nthis fact, that the Jewish Lawgiver, though touching science at a\r\nthousand points, has written nothing that has not been “demonstrated to\r\nbe exactly and strictly true,” is an irrefragable proof of his having\r\nderived his knowledge from a supernatural source.  How does it happen,\r\nthen, that Dr. Cumming forsakes this strong position?  How is it that we\r\nfind him, some pages further on, engaged in reconciling Genesis with the\r\ndiscoveries of science, by means of imaginative hypotheses and feats of\r\n“interpretation?”  Surely, that which has been demonstrated to be exactly\r\nand strictly true does not require hypothesis and critical argument, in\r\norder to show that it may _possibly_ agree with those very discoveries by\r\nmeans of which its exact and strict truth has been demonstrated.  And why\r\nshould Dr. Cumming suppose, as we shall presently find him supposing,\r\nthat men of science hesitate to accept the Bible, because it appears to\r\ncontradict their discoveries?  By his own statement, that appearance of\r\ncontradiction does not exist; on the contrary, it has been demonstrated\r\nthat the Bible precisely agrees with their discoveries.  Perhaps,\r\nhowever, in saying of the Bible that its “slightest intimations of\r\nscientific principles or natural phenomena have in every instance been\r\ndemonstrated to be exactly and strictly true,” Dr. Cumming merely means\r\nto imply that theologians have found out a way of explaining the biblical\r\ntext so that it no longer, in their opinion, appears to be in\r\ncontradiction with the discoveries of science.  One of two things,\r\ntherefore: either he uses language without the slightest appreciation of\r\nits real meaning, or the assertions he makes on one page are directly\r\ncontradicted by the arguments he urges on another.\r\n\r\nDr. Cumming’s principles—or, we should rather say, confused notions—of\r\nbiblical interpretation, as exhibited in this volume, are particularly\r\nsignificant of his mental calibre.  He says (“Church before the Flood,”\r\np. 93): “Men of science, who are full of scientific investigation and\r\nenamored of scientific discovery, will hesitate before they accept a book\r\nwhich, they think, contradicts the plainest and the most unequivocal\r\ndisclosures they have made in the bowels of the earth, or among the stars\r\nof the sky.  To all these we answer, as we have already indicated, there\r\nis not the least dissonance between God’s written book and the most\r\nmature discoveries of geological science.  One thing, however, there may\r\nbe: _there may be a contradiction between the discoveries of geology and\r\nour preconceived interpretations of the Bible_.  But this is not because\r\nthe Bible is wrong, but because our interpretation is wrong.”  (The\r\nitalics in all cases are our own.)\r\n\r\nElsewhere he says: “It seems to me plainly evident that the record of\r\nGenesis, when read fairly, and not in the light of our prejudices—_and\r\nmind you_, _the essence of Popery is to read the Bible in the light of\r\nour opinions_, _instead of viewing our opinions in the light of the\r\nBible_, _in its plain and obvious sense_—falls in perfectly with the\r\nassertion of geologists.”\r\n\r\nOn comparing these two passages, we gather that when Dr. Cumming, under\r\nstress of geological discovery, assigns to the biblical text a meaning\r\nentirely different from that which, on his own showing, was universally\r\nascribed to it for more than three thousand years, he regards himself as\r\n“viewing his opinions in the light of the Bible in its plain and obvious\r\nsense!”  Now he is reduced to one of two alternatives: either he must\r\nhold that the “plain and obvious meaning” of the whole Bible differs from\r\nage to age, so that the criterion of its meaning lies in the sum of\r\nknowledge possessed by each successive age—the Bible being an elastic\r\ngarment for the growing thought of mankind; or he must hold that some\r\nportions are amenable to this criterion, and others not so.  In the\r\nformer case, he accepts the principle of interpretation adopted by the\r\nearly German rationalists; in the latter case he has to show a further\r\ncriterion by which we can judge what parts of the Bible are elastic and\r\nwhat rigid.  If he says that the interpretation of the text is rigid\r\nwherever it treats of doctrines necessary to salvation, we answer, that\r\nfor doctrines to be necessary to salvation they must first be true; and\r\nin order to be true, according to his own principle, they must be founded\r\non a correct interpretation of the biblical text.  Thus he makes the\r\nnecessity of doctrines to salvation the criterion of infallible\r\ninterpretation, and infallible interpretation the criterion of doctrines\r\nbeing necessary to salvation.  He is whirled round in a circle, having,\r\nby admitting the principle of novelty in interpretation, completely\r\ndeprived himself of a basis.  That he should seize the very moment in\r\nwhich he is most palpably betraying that he has no test of biblical truth\r\nbeyond his own opinion, as an appropriate occasion for flinging the\r\nrather novel reproach against Popery that its essence is to “read the\r\nBible in the light of our opinions,” would be an almost pathetic\r\nself-exposure, if it were not disgusting.  Imbecility that is not even\r\nmeek, ceases to be pitiable, and becomes simply odious.\r\n\r\nParenthetic lashes of this kind against Popery are very frequent with Dr.\r\nCumming, and occur even in his more devout passages, where their\r\nintroduction must surely disturb the spiritual exercises of his hearers.\r\nIndeed, Roman Catholics fare worse with him even than infidels.  Infidels\r\nare the small vermin—the mice to be bagged _en passant_.  The main object\r\nof his chase—the rats which are to be nailed up as trophies—are the Roman\r\nCatholics.  Romanism is the masterpiece of Satan; but reassure\r\nyourselves! Dr. Cumming has been created.  Antichrist is enthroned in the\r\nVatican; but he is stoutly withstood by the Boanerges of Crown-court.\r\nThe personality of Satan, as might be expected, is a very prominent tenet\r\nin Dr. Cumming’s discourses; those who doubt it are, he thinks,\r\n“generally specimens of the victims of Satan as a triumphant seducer;”\r\nand it is through the medium of this doctrine that he habitually\r\ncontemplates Roman Catholics.  They are the puppets of which the devil\r\nholds the strings.  It is only exceptionally that he speaks of them as\r\nfellow-men, acted on by the same desires, fears, and hopes as himself;\r\nhis _rule_ is to hold them up to his hearers as foredoomed instruments of\r\nSatan and vessels of wrath.  If he is obliged to admit that they are “no\r\nshams,” that they are “thoroughly in earnest”—that is because they are\r\ninspired by hell, because they are under an “infra-natural” influence.\r\nIf their missionaries are found wherever Protestant missionaries go, this\r\nzeal in propagating their faith is not in them a consistent virtue, as it\r\nis in Protestants, but a “melancholy fact,” affording additional evidence\r\nthat they are instigated and assisted by the devil.  And Dr. Cumming is\r\ninclined to think that they work miracles, because that is no more than\r\nmight be expected from the known ability of Satan who inspires them.\r\n{86a}  He admits, indeed, that “there is a fragment of the Church of\r\nChrist in the very bosom of that awful apostasy,” {86b} and that there\r\nare members of the Church of Rome in glory; but this admission is rare\r\nand episodical—is a declaration, _pro formâ_, about as influential on the\r\ngeneral disposition and habits as an aristocrat’s profession of\r\ndemocracy.\r\n\r\nThis leads us to mention another conspicuous characteristic of Dr.\r\nCumming’s teaching—the _absence of genuine charity_.  It is true that he\r\nmakes large profession of tolerance and liberality within a certain\r\ncircle; he exhorts Christians to unity; he would have Churchmen\r\nfraternize with Dissenters, and exhorts these two branches of God’s\r\nfamily to defer the settlement of their differences till the millennium.\r\nBut the love thus taught is the love of the _clan_, which is the\r\ncorrelative of antagonism to the rest of mankind.  It is not sympathy and\r\nhelpfulness toward men as men, but toward men as Christians, and as\r\nChristians in the sense of a small minority.  Dr. Cumming’s religion may\r\ndemand a tribute of love, but it gives a charter to hatred; it may enjoin\r\ncharity, but it fosters all uncharitableness.  If I believe that God\r\ntells me to love my enemies, but at the same time hates His own enemies\r\nand requires me to have one will with Him, which has the larger scope,\r\nlove or hatred?  And we refer to those pages of Dr. Cumming’s in which he\r\nopposes Roman Catholics, Puseyites, and infidels—pages which form the\r\nlarger proportion of what he has published—for proof that the idea of God\r\nwhich both the logic and spirit of his discourses keep present to his\r\nhearers, is that of a God who hates his enemies, a God who teaches love\r\nby fierce denunciations of wrath—a God who encourages obedience to his\r\nprecepts by elaborately revealing to us that his own government is in\r\nprecise opposition to those precepts.  We know the usual evasions on this\r\nsubject.  We know Dr. Cumming would say that even Roman Catholics are to\r\nbe loved and succored as men; that he would help even that “unclean\r\nspirit,” Cardinal Wiseman, out of a ditch.  But who that is in the\r\nslightest degree acquainted with the action of the human mind will\r\nbelieve that any genuine and large charity can grow out of an exercise of\r\nlove which is always to have an _arrière-pensée_ of hatred?  Of what\r\nquality would be the conjugal love of a husband who loved his spouse as a\r\nwife, but hated her as a woman?  It is reserved for the regenerate mind,\r\naccording to Dr. Cumming’s conception of it, to be “wise, amazed,\r\ntemperate and furious, loyal and neutral, in a moment.”  Precepts of\r\ncharity uttered with a faint breath at the end of a sermon are perfectly\r\nfutile, when all the force of the lungs has been spent in keeping the\r\nhearer’s mind fixed on the conception of his fellow-men not as\r\nfellow-sinners and fellow-sufferers, but as agents of hell, as automata\r\nthrough whom Satan plays his game upon earth—not on objects which call\r\nforth their reverence, their love, their hope of good even in the most\r\nstrayed and perverted, but on a minute identification of human things\r\nwith such symbols as the scarlet whore, the beast out of the abyss,\r\nscorpions whose sting is in their tails, men who have the mark of the\r\nbeast, and unclean spirits like frogs.  You might as well attempt to\r\neducate the child’s sense of beauty by hanging its nursery with the\r\nhorrible and grotesque pictures in which the early painters represented\r\nthe Last Judgment, as expect Christian graces to flourish on that\r\nprophetic interpretation which Dr. Cumming offers as the principal\r\nnutriment of his flock.  Quite apart from the critical basis of that\r\ninterpretation, quite apart from the degree of truth there may be in Dr.\r\nCumming’s prognostications—questions into which we do not choose to\r\nenter—his use of prophecy must be _à priori_ condemned in the judgment of\r\nright-minded persons, by its results as testified in the net moral effect\r\nof his sermons.  The best minds that accept Christianity as a divinely\r\ninspired system, believe that the great end of the Gospel is not merely\r\nthe saving but the educating of men’s souls, the creating within them of\r\nholy dispositions, the subduing of egoistical pretensions, and the\r\nperpetual enhancing of the desire that the will of God—a will synonymous\r\nwith goodness and truth—may be done on earth.  But what relation to all\r\nthis has a system of interpretation which keeps the mind of the Christian\r\nin the position of a spectator at a gladiatorial show, of which Satan is\r\nthe wild beast in the shape of the great red dragon, and two thirds of\r\nmankind the victims—the whole provided and got up by God for the\r\nedification of the saints?  The demonstration that the Second Advent is\r\nat hand, if true, can have no really holy, spiritual effect; the highest\r\nstate of mind inculcated by the Gospel is resignation to the disposal of\r\nGod’s providence—“Whether we live, we live unto the Lord; whether we die,\r\nwe die unto the Lord”—not an eagerness to see a temporal manifestation\r\nwhich shall confound the enemies of God and give exaltation to the\r\nsaints; it is to dwell in Christ by spiritual communion with his nature,\r\nnot to fix the date when He shall appear in the sky.  Dr. Cumming’s\r\ndelight in shadowing forth the downfall of the Man of Sin, in\r\nprognosticating the battle of Gog and Magog, and in advertising the\r\npre-millennial Advent, is simply the transportation of political passions\r\non to a so-called religious platform; it is the anticipation of the\r\ntriumph of “our party,” accomplished by our principal men being “sent\r\nfor” into the clouds.  Let us be understood to speak in all seriousness.\r\nIf we were in search of amusement, we should not seek for it by examining\r\nDr. Cumming’s works in order to ridicule them.  We are simply discharging\r\na disagreeable duty in delivering our opinion that, judged by the highest\r\nstandard even of orthodox Christianity, they are little calculated to\r\nproduce—\r\n\r\n    “A closer walk with God,\r\n    A calm and heavenly frame;”\r\n\r\nbut are more likely to nourish egoistic complacency and pretension, a\r\nhard and condemnatory spirit toward one’s fellow-men, and a busy\r\noccupation with the minutiæ of events, instead of a reverent\r\ncontemplation of great facts and a wise application of great principles.\r\nIt would be idle to consider Dr. Cumming’s theory of prophecy in any\r\nother light; as a philosophy of history or a specimen of biblical\r\ninterpretation, it bears about the same relation to the extension of\r\ngenuine knowledge as the astrological “house” in the heavens bears to the\r\ntrue structure and relations of the universe.\r\n\r\nThe slight degree in which Dr. Cumming’s faith is imbued with truly human\r\nsympathies is exhibited in the way he treats the doctrine of Eternal\r\nPunishment.  Here a little of that readiness to strain the letter of the\r\nScriptures which he so often manifests when his object is to prove a\r\npoint against Romanism, would have been an amiable frailty if it had been\r\napplied on the side of mercy.  When he is bent on proving that the\r\nprophecy concerning the Man of Sin, in the Second Epistle to the\r\nThessalonians, refers to the Pope, he can extort from the innocent word\r\n_καθισαι_ the meaning _cathedrize_, though why we are to translate “He as\r\nGod cathedrizes in the temple of God,” any more than we are to translate\r\n“cathedrize here, while I go and pray yonder,” it is for Dr. Cumming to\r\nshow more clearly than he has yet done.  But when rigorous literality\r\nwill favor the conclusion that the greater proportion of the human race\r\nwill be eternally miserable—_then_ he is rigorously literal.\r\n\r\nHe says: “The Greek words, _εις_, _τους αιώνας των αιώνων_, here\r\ntranslated ‘everlasting,’ signify literally ‘unto the ages of ages,’ αιει\r\nων, ‘always being,’ that is, everlasting, ceaseless existence.  Plato\r\nuses the word in this sense when he says, ‘The gods that live forever.’\r\n_But I must also admit_ that this word is used several times in a limited\r\nextent—as for instance, ‘The everlasting hills.’  Of course this does not\r\nmean that there never will be a time when the hills will cease to stand;\r\nthe expression here is evidently figurative, but it implies eternity.\r\nThe hills shall remain as long as the earth lasts, and no hand has power\r\nto remove them but that Eternal One which first called them into being;\r\n_so the state of the soul_ remains the same after death as long as the\r\nsoul exists, and no one has power to alter it.  The same word is often\r\napplied to denote the existence of God—‘the Eternal God.’  Can we limit\r\nthe word when applied to him?  Because occasionally used in a limited\r\nsense, we must not infer it is always so.  ‘Everlasting’ plainly means in\r\nScripture ‘without end;’ it is only to be explained figuratively when it\r\nis evident it cannot be interpreted in any other way.”\r\n\r\nWe do not discuss whether Dr. Cumming’s interpretation accords with the\r\nmeaning of the New Testament writers: we simply point to the fact that\r\nthe text becomes elastic for him when he wants freer play for his\r\nprejudices, while he makes it an adamantine barrier against the admission\r\nthat mercy will ultimately triumph—that God, _i.e._, Love, will be all in\r\nall.  He assures us that he does not “delight to dwell on the misery of\r\nthe lost:” and we believe him.  That misery does not seem to be a\r\nquestion of feeling with him, either one way or the other.  He does not\r\nmerely resign himself to the awful mystery of eternal punishment; he\r\ncontends for it.  Do we object, he asks, {90} to everlasting happiness?\r\nthen why object to everlasting misery?—reasoning which is perhaps felt to\r\nbe cogent by theologians who anticipate the everlasting happiness for\r\nthemselves, and the everlasting misery for their neighbors.\r\n\r\nThe compassion of some Christians has been glad to take refuge in the\r\nopinion that the Bible allows the supposition of annihilation for the\r\nimpenitent; but the rigid sequence of Dr. Cumming’s reasoning will not\r\nadmit of this idea.  He sees that flax is made into linen, and linen into\r\npaper; that paper, when burned, partly ascends as smoke and then again\r\ndescends in rain, or in dust and carbon.  “Not one particle of the\r\noriginal flax is lost, although there may be not one particle that has\r\nnot undergone an entire change: annihilation is not, but change of form\r\nis.  _It will be thus with our bodies at the resurrection_.  The death of\r\nthe body means not annihilation.  _Not one feature of the face_ will be\r\nannihilated.”  Having established the perpetuity of the body by this\r\nclose and clear analogy, namely, that _as_ there is a total change in the\r\nparticles of flax in consequence of which they no longer appear as flax,\r\n_so_ there will _not_ be a total change in the particles of the human\r\nbody, but they will reappear as the human body, he does not seem to\r\nconsider that the perpetuity of the body involves the perpetuity of the\r\nsoul, but requires separate evidence for this, and finds such evidence by\r\nbegging the very question at issue—namely, by asserting that the text of\r\nthe Scripture implies “the perpetuity of the punishment of the lost, and\r\nthe consciousness of the punishment which they endure.”  Yet it is\r\ndrivelling like this which is listened to and lauded as eloquence by\r\nhundreds, and which a Doctor of Divinity can believe that he has his\r\n“reward as a saint” for preaching and publishing!\r\n\r\nOne more characteristic of Dr. Cumming’s writings, and we have done.\r\nThis is the _perverted moral judgment_ that everywhere reigns in them.\r\nNot that this perversion is peculiar to Dr. Cumming: it belongs to the\r\ndogmatic system which he shares with all evangelical believers.  But the\r\nabstract tendencies of systems are represented in very different degrees,\r\naccording to the different characters of those who embrace them; just as\r\nthe same food tells differently on different constitutions: and there are\r\ncertain qualities in Dr. Cumming that cause the perversion of which we\r\nspeak to exhibit itself with peculiar prominence in his teaching.  A\r\nsingle extract will enable us to explain what we mean:\r\n\r\n    “The ‘thoughts’ are evil.  If it were possible for human eye to\r\n    discern and to detect the thoughts that flutter around the heart of\r\n    an unregenerate man—to mark their hue and their multitude, it would\r\n    be found that they are indeed ‘evil.’  We speak not of the thief, and\r\n    the murderer, and the adulterer, and such like, whose crimes draw\r\n    down the cognizance of earthly tribunals, and whose unenviable\r\n    character it is to take the lead in the paths of sin; but we refer to\r\n    the men who are marked out by their practice of many of the seemliest\r\n    moralities of life—by the exercise of the kindliest affections, and\r\n    the interchange of the sweetest reciprocities—and of these men, if\r\n    unrenewed and unchanged, we pronounce that their thoughts are evil.\r\n    To ascertain this, we must refer to the object around which our\r\n    thoughts ought continually to circulate.  The Scriptures assert that\r\n    this object is _the glory of God_; that for this we ought to think,\r\n    to act, and to speak; and that in thus thinking, acting, and\r\n    speaking, there is involved the purest and most endearing bliss.  Now\r\n    it will be found true of the most amiable men, that with all their\r\n    good society and kindliness of heart, and all their strict and\r\n    unbending integrity, they never or rarely think of the glory of God.\r\n    The question never occurs to them—Will this redound to the glory of\r\n    God?  Will this make his name more known, his being more loved, his\r\n    praise more sung?  And just inasmuch as their every thought comes\r\n    short of this lofty aim, in so much does it come short of good, and\r\n    entitle itself to the character of evil.  If the glory of God is not\r\n    the absorbing and the influential aim of their thoughts, then they\r\n    are evil; but God’s glory never enters into their minds.  They are\r\n    amiable, because it chances to be one of the constitutional\r\n    tendencies of their individual character, left uneffaced by the Fall;\r\n    and _they are just and upright_, _because they have perhaps no\r\n    occasion to be otherwise_, _or find it subservient to their interests\r\n    to maintain such a character_.”—“Occ. Disc.” vol. i. p. 8.\r\n\r\nAgain we read (Ibid. p. 236):\r\n\r\n    “There are traits in the Christian character which the mere worldly\r\n    man cannot understand.  He can understand the outward morality, but\r\n    he cannot understand the inner spring of it; he can understand\r\n    Dorcas’ liberality to the poor, but he cannot penetrate the ground of\r\n    Dorcas’ liberality.  _Some men give to the poor because they are\r\n    ostentatious_, _or because they think the poor will ultimately avenge\r\n    their __neglect_; _but the Christian gives to the poor_, _not only\r\n    because he has sensibilities like other men_, but because inasmuch as\r\n    ye did it to the least of these my brethren ye did it unto me.”\r\n\r\nBefore entering on the more general question involved in these\r\nquotations, we must point to the clauses we have marked with italics,\r\nwhere Dr. Cumming appears to express sentiments which, we are happy to\r\nthink, are not shared by the majority of his brethren in the faith.  Dr.\r\nCumming, it seems, is unable to conceive that the natural man can have\r\nany other motive for being just and upright than that it is useless to be\r\notherwise, or that a character for honesty is profitable; according to\r\nhis experience, between the feelings of ostentation and selfish alarm and\r\nthe feeling of love to Christ, there lie no sensibilities which can lead\r\na man to relieve want.  Granting, as we should prefer to think, that it\r\nis Dr. Cumming’s exposition of his sentiments which is deficient rather\r\nthan his sentiments themselves, still, the fact that the deficiency lies\r\nprecisely here, and that he can overlook it not only in the haste of oral\r\ndelivery but in the examination of proof-sheets, is strongly significant\r\nof his mental bias—of the faint degree in which he sympathizes with the\r\ndisinterested elements of human feeling, and of the fact, which we are\r\nabout to dwell upon, that those feelings are totally absent from his\r\nreligious theory.  Now, Dr. Cumming invariably assumes that, in\r\nfulminating against those who differ from him, he is standing on a moral\r\nelevation to which they are compelled reluctantly to look up; that his\r\ntheory of motives and conduct is in its loftiness and purity a perpetual\r\nrebuke to their low and vicious desires and practice.  It is time he\r\nshould be told that the reverse is the fact; that there are men who do\r\nnot merely cast a superficial glance at his doctrine, and fail to see its\r\nbeauty or justice, but who, after a close consideration of that doctrine,\r\npronounce it to be subversive of true moral development, and therefore\r\npositively noxious.  Dr. Cumming is fond of showing up the teaching of\r\nRomanism, and accusing it of undermining true morality: it is time he\r\nshould be told that there is a large body, both of thinkers and practical\r\nmen, who hold precisely the same opinion of his own teaching—with this\r\ndifference, that they do not regard it as the inspiration of Satan, but\r\nas the natural crop of a human mind where the soil is chiefly made up of\r\negoistic passions and dogmatic beliefs.\r\n\r\nDr. Cumming’s theory, as we have seen, is that actions are good or evil\r\naccording as they are prompted or not prompted by an exclusive reference\r\nto the “glory of God.”  God, then, in Dr. Cumming’s conception, is a\r\nbeing who has no pleasure in the exercise of love and truthfulness and\r\njustice, considered as affecting the well-being of his creatures; He has\r\nsatisfaction in us only in so far as we exhaust our motives and\r\ndispositions of all relation to our fellow-beings, and replace sympathy\r\nwith men by anxiety for the “glory of God.”  The deed of Grace Darling,\r\nwhen she took a boat in the storm to rescue drowning men and women, was\r\nnot good if it was only compassion that nerved her arm and impelled her\r\nto brave death for the chance of saving others; it was only good if she\r\nasked herself—Will this redound to the glory of God?  The man who endures\r\ntortures rather than betray a trust, the man who spends years in toil in\r\norder to discharge an obligation from which the law declares him free,\r\nmust be animated not by the spirit of fidelity to his fellow-man, but by\r\na desire to make “the name of God more known.”  The sweet charities of\r\ndomestic life—the ready hand and the soothing word in sickness, the\r\nforbearance toward frailties, the prompt helpfulness in all efforts and\r\nsympathy in all joys, are simply evil if they result from a\r\n“constitutional tendency,” or from dispositions disciplined by the\r\nexperience of suffering and the perception of moral loveliness.  A wife\r\nis not to devote herself to her husband out of love to him and a sense of\r\nthe duties implied by a close relation—she is to be a faithful wife for\r\nthe glory of God; if she feels her natural affections welling up too\r\nstrongly, she is to repress them; it will not do to act from natural\r\naffection—she must think of the glory of God.  A man is to guide his\r\naffairs with energy and discretion, not from an honest desire to fulfil\r\nhis responsibilities as a member of society and a father, but—that “God’s\r\npraise may be sung.”  Dr. Cumming’s Christian pays his debts for the\r\nglory of God; were it not for the coercion of that supreme motive, it\r\nwould be evil to pay them.  A man is not to be just from a feeling of\r\njustice; he is not to help his fellow-men out of good-will to his\r\nfellow-men; he is not to be a tender husband and father out of affection:\r\nall these natural muscles and fibres are to be torn away and replaced by\r\na patent steel-spring—anxiety for the “glory of God.”\r\n\r\nHappily, the constitution of human nature forbids the complete prevalence\r\nof such a theory.  Fatally powerful as religious systems have been, human\r\nnature is stronger and wider than religious systems, and though dogmas\r\nmay hamper, they cannot absolutely repress its growth: build walls round\r\nthe living tree as you will, the bricks and mortar have by and by to give\r\nway before the slow and sure operation of the sap.  But next to the\r\nhatred of the enemies of God which is the principle of persecution, there\r\nperhaps has been no perversion more obstructive of true moral development\r\nthan this substitution of a reference to the glory of God for the direct\r\npromptings of the sympathetic feelings.  Benevolence and justice are\r\nstrong only in proportion as they are directly and inevitably called into\r\nactivity by their proper objects; pity is strong only because we are\r\nstrongly impressed by suffering; and only in proportion as it is\r\ncompassion that speaks through the eyes when we soothe, and moves the arm\r\nwhen we succor, is a deed strictly benevolent.  If the soothing or the\r\nsuccor be given because another being wishes or approves it, the deed\r\nceases to be one of benevolence, and becomes one of deference, of\r\nobedience, of self-interest, or vanity.  Accessory motives may aid in\r\nproducing an _action_, but they presuppose the weakness of the direct\r\nmotive; and conversely, when the direct motive is strong, the action of\r\naccessory motives will be excluded.  If, then, as Dr. Cumming inculcates,\r\nthe glory of God is to be “the absorbing and the influential aim” in our\r\nthoughts and actions, this must tend to neutralize the human sympathies;\r\nthe stream of feeling will be diverted from its natural current in order\r\nto feed an artificial canal.  The idea of God is really moral in its\r\ninfluence—it really cherishes all that is best and loveliest in man—only\r\nwhen God is contemplated as sympathizing with the pure elements of human\r\nfeeling, as possessing infinitely all those attributes which we recognize\r\nto be moral in humanity.  In this light, the idea of God and the sense of\r\nHis presence intensify all noble feeling, and encourage all noble effort,\r\non the same principle that human sympathy is found a source of strength:\r\nthe brave man feels braver when he knows that another stout heart is\r\nbeating time with his; the devoted woman who is wearing out her years in\r\npatient effort to alleviate suffering or save vice from the last stages\r\nof degradation, finds aid in the pressure of a friendly hand which tells\r\nher that there is one who understands her deeds, and in her place would\r\ndo the like.  The idea of a God who not only sympathizes with all we feel\r\nand endure for our fellow-men, but who will pour new life into our too\r\nlanguid love, and give firmness to our vacillating purpose, is an\r\nextension and multiplication of the effects produced by human sympathy;\r\nand it has been intensified for the better spirits who have been under\r\nthe influence of orthodox Christianity, by the contemplation of Jesus as\r\n“God manifest in the flesh.”  But Dr. Cumming’s God is the very opposite\r\nof all this: he is a God who instead of sharing and aiding our human\r\nsympathies, is directly in collision with them; who instead of\r\nstrengthening the bond between man and man, by encouraging the sense that\r\nthey are both alike the objects of His love and care, thrusts himself\r\nbetween them and forbids them to feel for each other except as they have\r\nrelation to Him.  He is a God who, instead of adding his solar force to\r\nswell the tide of those impulses that tend to give humanity a common life\r\nin which the good of one is the good of all, commands us to check those\r\nimpulses, lest they should prevent us from thinking of His glory.  It is\r\nin vain for Dr. Cumming to say that we are to love man for God’s sake:\r\nwith the conception of God which his teaching presents, the love of man\r\nfor God’s sake involves, as his writings abundantly show, a strong\r\nprinciple of hatred.  We can only love one being for the sake of another\r\nwhen there is an habitual delight in associating the idea of those two\r\nbeings—that is, when the object of our indirect love is a source of joy\r\nand honor to the object of our direct love; but according to Dr.\r\nCumming’s theory, the majority of mankind—the majority of his\r\nneighbors—are in precisely the opposite relation to God.  His soul has no\r\npleasure in them, they belong more to Satan than to Him, and if they\r\ncontribute to His glory, it is against their will.  Dr. Cumming then can\r\nonly love _some_ men for God’s sake; the rest he must in consistency\r\n_hate_ for God’s sake.\r\n\r\nThere must be many, even in the circle of Dr. Cumming’s admirers, who\r\nwould be revolted by the doctrine we have just exposed, if their natural\r\ngood sense and healthy feeling were not early stifled by dogmatic\r\nbeliefs, and their reverence misled by pious phrases.  But as it is, many\r\na rational question, many a generous instinct, is repelled as the\r\nsuggestion of a supernatural enemy, or as the ebullition of human pride\r\nand corruption.  This state of inward contradiction can be put an end to\r\nonly by the conviction that the free and diligent exertion of the\r\nintellect, instead of being a sin, is part of their responsibility—that\r\nRight and Reason are synonymous.  The fundamental faith for man is, faith\r\nin the result of a brave, honest, and steady use of all his faculties:\r\n\r\n    “Let knowledge grow from more to more,\r\n       But more of reverence in us dwell;\r\n       That mind and soul according well\r\n    May make one music as before,\r\n       But vaster.”\r\n\r\nBefore taking leave of Dr. Cumming, let us express a hope that we have in\r\nno case exaggerated the unfavorable character of the inferences to be\r\ndrawn from his pages.  His creed often obliges him to hope the worst of\r\nmen, and exert himself in proving that the worst is true; but thus far we\r\nare happier than he.  We have no theory which requires us to attribute\r\nunworthy motives to Dr. Cumming, no opinions, religious or irreligious,\r\nwhich can make it a gratification to us to detect him in delinquencies.\r\nOn the contrary, the better we are able to think of him as a man, while\r\nwe are obliged to disapprove him as a theologian, the stronger will be\r\nthe evidence for our conviction, that the tendency toward good in human\r\nnature has a force which no creed can utterly counteract, and which\r\ninsures the ultimate triumph of that tendency over all dogmatic\r\nperversions.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIV.  GERMAN WIT: HENRY HEINE. {99}\r\n\r\n\r\n“Nothing,” says Goethe, “is more significant of men’s character than what\r\nthey find laughable.”  The truth of this observation would perhaps have\r\nbeen more apparent if he had said _culture_ instead of character.  The\r\nlast thing in which the cultivated man can have community with the vulgar\r\nis their jocularity; and we can hardly exhibit more strikingly the wide\r\ngulf which separates him from them, than by comparing the object which\r\nshakes the diaphragm of a coal-heaver with the highly complex pleasure\r\nderived from a real witticism.  That any high order of wit is exceedingly\r\ncomplex, and demands a ripe and strong mental development, has one\r\nevidence in the fact that we do not find it in boys at all in proportion\r\nto their manifestation of other powers.  Clever boys generally aspire to\r\nthe heroic and poetic rather than the comic, and the crudest of all their\r\nefforts are their jokes.  Many a witty man will remember how in his\r\nschool days a practical joke, more or less Rabelaisian, was for him the\r\n_ne plus ultra_ of the ludicrous.  It seems to have been the same with\r\nthe boyhood of the human race.  The history and literature of the ancient\r\nHebrews gives the idea of a people who went about their business and\r\ntheir pleasure as gravely as a society of beavers; the smile and the\r\nlaugh are often mentioned metaphorically, but the smile is one of\r\ncomplacency, the laugh is one of scorn.  Nor can we imagine that the\r\nfacetious element was very strong in the Egyptians; no laughter lurks in\r\nthe wondering eyes and the broad calm lips of their statues.  Still less\r\ncan the Assyrians have had any genius for the comic: the round eyes and\r\nsimpering satisfaction of their ideal faces belong to a type which is not\r\nwitty, but the cause of wit in others.  The fun of these early races was,\r\nwe fancy, of the after-dinner kind—loud-throated laughter over the\r\nwine-cup, taken too little account of in sober moments to enter as an\r\nelement into their Art, and differing as much from the laughter of a\r\nChamfort or a Sheridan as the gastronomic enjoyment of an ancient Briton,\r\nwhose dinner had no other “removes” than from acorns to beech-mast and\r\nback again to acorns, differed from the subtle pleasures of the palate\r\nexperienced by his turtle-eating descendant.  In fact they had to live\r\nseriously through the stages which to subsequent races were to become\r\ncomedy, as those amiable-looking preadamite amphibia which Professor Owen\r\nhas restored for us in effigy at Sydenham, took perfectly _au sérieux_\r\nthe grotesque physiognomies of their kindred.  Heavy experience in their\r\ncase, as in every other, was the base from which the salt of future wit\r\nwas to be made.\r\n\r\nHumor is of earlier growth than Wit, and it is in accordance with this\r\nearlier growth that it has more affinity with the poetic tendencies,\r\nwhile Wit is more nearly allied to the ratiocinative intellect.  Humor\r\ndraws its materials from situations and characteristics; Wit seizes on\r\nunexpected and complex relations.  Humor is chiefly representative and\r\ndescriptive; it is diffuse, and flows along without any other law than\r\nits own fantastic will; or it flits about like a will-of-the-wisp,\r\namazing us by its whimsical transitions.  Wit is brief and sudden, and\r\nsharply defined as a crystal; it does not make pictures, it is not\r\nfantastic; but it detects an unsuspected analogy or suggests a startling\r\nor confounding inference.  Every one who has had the opportunity of\r\nmaking the comparison will remember that the effect produced on him by\r\nsome witticisms is closely akin to the effect produced on him by subtle\r\nreasoning which lays open a fallacy or absurdity, and there are persons\r\nwhose delight in such reasoning always manifests itself in laughter.\r\nThis affinity of wit with ratiocination is the more obvious in proportion\r\nas the species of wit is higher and deals less with less words and with\r\nsuperficialities than with the essential qualities of things.  Some of\r\nJohnson’s most admirable witticisms consist in the suggestion of an\r\nanalogy which immediately exposes the absurdity of an action or\r\nproposition; and it is only their ingenuity, condensation, and\r\ninstantaneousness which lift them from reasoning into Wit—they are\r\n_reasoning raised to a higher power_.  On the other hand, Humor, in its\r\nhigher forms, and in proportion as it associates itself with the\r\nsympathetic emotions, continually passes into poetry: nearly all great\r\nmodern humorists may be called prose poets.\r\n\r\nSome confusion as to the nature of Humor has been created by the fact\r\nthat those who have written most eloquently on it have dwelt almost\r\nexclusively on its higher forms, and have defined humor in general as the\r\n_sympathetic_ presentation of incongruous elements in human nature and\r\nlife—a definition which only applies to its later development.  A great\r\ndeal of humor may coexist with a great deal of barbarism, as we see in\r\nthe Middle Ages; but the strongest flavor of the humor in such cases will\r\ncome, not from sympathy, but more probably from triumphant egoism or\r\nintolerance; at best it will be the love of the ludicrous exhibiting\r\nitself in illustrations of successful cunning and of the _lex talionis_\r\nas in _Reineke Fuchs_, or shaking off in a holiday mood the yoke of a too\r\nexacting faith, as in the old Mysteries.  Again, it is impossible to deny\r\na high degree of humor to many practical jokes, but no sympathetic nature\r\ncan enjoy them.  Strange as the genealogy may seem, the original\r\nparentage of that wonderful and delicious mixture of fun, fancy,\r\nphilosophy, and feeling, which constitutes modern humor, was probably the\r\ncruel mockery of a savage at the writhings of a suffering enemy—such is\r\nthe tendency of things toward the good and beautiful on this earth!\r\nProbably the reason why high culture demands more complete harmony with\r\nits moral sympathies in humor than in wit, is that humor is in its nature\r\nmore prolix—that it has not the direct and irresistible force of wit.\r\nWit is an electric shock, which takes us by violence, quite independently\r\nof our predominant mental disposition; but humor approaches us more\r\ndeliberately and leaves us masters of ourselves.  Hence it is, that while\r\ncoarse and cruel humor has almost disappeared from contemporary\r\nliterature, coarse and cruel wit abounds; even refined men cannot help\r\nlaughing at a coarse _bon mot_ or a lacerating personality, if the\r\n“shock” of the witticism is a powerful one; while mere fun will have no\r\npower over them if it jar on their moral taste.  Hence, too, it is, that\r\nwhile wit is perennial, humor is liable to become superannuated.\r\n\r\nAs is usual with definitions and classifications, however, this\r\ndistinction between wit and humor does not exactly represent the actual\r\nfact.  Like all other species, Wit and Humor overlap and blend with each\r\nother.  There are _bon mots_, like many of Charles Lamb’s, which are a\r\nsort of facetious hybrids, we hardly know whether to call them witty or\r\nhumorous; there are rather lengthy descriptions or narratives, which,\r\nlike Voltaire’s “Micromégas,” would be more humorous if they were not so\r\nsparkling and antithetic, so pregnant with suggestion and satire, that we\r\nare obliged to call them witty.  We rarely find wit untempered by humor,\r\nor humor without a spice of wit; and sometimes we find them both united\r\nin the highest degree in the same mind, as in Shakespeare and Molière.  A\r\nhappy conjunction this, for wit is apt to be cold, and thin-lipped, and\r\nMephistophelean in men who have no relish for humor, whose lungs do never\r\ncrow like Chanticleer at fun and drollery; and broad-faced, rollicking\r\nhumor needs the refining influence of wit.  Indeed, it may be said that\r\nthere is no really fine writing in which wit has not an implicit, if not\r\nan explicit, action.  The wit may never rise to the surface, it may never\r\nflame out into a witticism; but it helps to give brightness and\r\ntransparency, it warns off from flights and exaggerations which verge on\r\nthe ridiculous—in every _genre_ of writing it preserves a man from\r\nsinking into the _genre ennuyeux_.  And it is eminently needed for this\r\noffice in humorous writing; for as humor has no limits imposed on it by\r\nits material, no law but its own exuberance, it is apt to become\r\npreposterous and wearisome unless checked by wit, which is the enemy of\r\nall monotony, of all lengthiness, of all exaggeration.\r\n\r\nPerhaps the nearest approach Nature has given us to a complete analysis,\r\nin which wit is as thoroughly exhausted of humor as possible, and humor\r\nas bare as possible of wit, is in the typical Frenchman and the typical\r\nGerman.  Voltaire, the intensest example of pure wit, fails in most of\r\nhis fictions from his lack of humor.  “Micromégas” is a perfect tale,\r\nbecause, as it deals chiefly with philosophic ideas and does not touch\r\nthe marrow of human feeling and life, the writer’s wit and wisdom were\r\nall-sufficient for his purpose.  Not so with “Candide.”  Here Voltaire\r\nhad to give pictures of life as well as to convey philosophic truth and\r\nsatire, and here we feel the want of humor.  The sense of the ludicrous\r\nis continually defeated by disgust, and the scenes, instead of presenting\r\nus with an amusing or agreeable picture, are only the frame for a\r\nwitticism.  On the other hand, German humor generally shows no sense of\r\nmeasure, no instinctive tact; it is either floundering and clumsy as the\r\nantics of a leviathan, or laborious and interminable as a Lapland day, in\r\nwhich one loses all hope that the stars and quiet will ever come.  For\r\nthis reason, Jean Paul, the greatest of German humorists, is unendurable\r\nto many readers, and frequently tiresome to all.  Here, as elsewhere, the\r\nGerman shows the absence of that delicate perception, that sensibility to\r\ngradation, which is the essence of tact and taste, and the necessary\r\nconcomitant of wit.  All his subtlety is reserved for the region of\r\nmetaphysics.  For _Identität_ in the abstract no one can have an acuter\r\nvision, but in the concrete he is satisfied with a very loose\r\napproximation.  He has the finest nose for _Empirismus_ in philosophical\r\ndoctrine, but the presence of more or less tobacco smoke in the air he\r\nbreathes is imperceptible to him.  To the typical German—_Vetter\r\nMichel_—it is indifferent whether his door-lock will catch, whether his\r\nteacup be more or less than an inch thick; whether or not his book have\r\nevery other leaf unstitched; whether his neighbor’s conversation be more\r\nor less of a shout; whether he pronounce _b_ or _p_, _t_ or _d_; whether\r\nor not his adored one’s teeth be few and far between.  He has the same\r\nsort of insensibility to gradations in time.  A German comedy is like a\r\nGerman sentence: you see no reason in its structure why it should ever\r\ncome to an end, and you accept the conclusion as an arrangement of\r\nProvidence rather than of the author.  We have heard Germans use the word\r\n_Langeweile_, the equivalent for ennui, and we have secretly wondered\r\n_what_ it can be that produces ennui in a German.  Not the longest of\r\nlong tragedies, for we have known him to pronounce that _höchst fesselnd_\r\n(_so_ enchaining!); not the heaviest of heavy books, for he delights in\r\nthat as _gründlich_ (deep, Sir, deep!); not the slowest of journeys in a\r\n_Postwagen_, for the slower the horses, the more cigars he can smoke\r\nbefore he reaches his journey’s end.  German ennui must be something as\r\nsuperlative as Barclay’s treble X, which, we suppose, implies an\r\nextremely unknown quantity of stupefaction.\r\n\r\nIt is easy to see that this national deficiency in nicety of perception\r\nmust have its effect on the national appreciation and exhibition of\r\nHumor.  You find in Germany ardent admirers of Shakespeare, who tell you\r\nthat what they think most admirable in him is his _Wortspiel_, his verbal\r\nquibbles; and one of these, a man of no slight culture and refinement,\r\nonce cited to a friend of ours Proteus’s joke in “The Two Gentlemen of\r\nVerona”—“Nod I? why that’s Noddy,” as a transcendant specimen of\r\nShakespearian wit.  German facetiousness is seldom comic to foreigners,\r\nand an Englishman with a swelled cheek might take up _Kladderadatsch_,\r\nthe German Punch, without any danger of agitating his facial muscles.\r\nIndeed, it is a remarkable fact that, among the five great races\r\nconcerned in modern civilization, the German race is the only one which,\r\nup to the present century, had contributed nothing classic to the common\r\nstock of European wit and humor; for _Reineke Fuchs_ cannot be regarded\r\nas a peculiarly Teutonic product.  Italy was the birthplace of Pantomime\r\nand the immortal Pulcinello; Spain had produced Cervantes; France had\r\nproduced Rabelais and Molière, and classic wits innumerable; England had\r\nyielded Shakspeare and a host of humorists.  But Germany had borne no\r\ngreat comic dramatist, no great satirist, and she has not yet repaired\r\nthe omission; she had not even produced any humorist of a high order.\r\nAmong her great writers, Lessing is the one who is the most specifically\r\nwitty.  We feel the implicit influence of wit—the “flavor of\r\nmind”—throughout his writings; and it is often concentrated into pungent\r\nsatire, as every reader of the _Hamburgische Dramaturgie_ remembers.\r\nStill Lessing’s name has not become European through his wit, and his\r\ncharming comedy, _Minna von Barnhelm_, has won no place on a foreign\r\nstage.  Of course we do not pretend to an exhaustive acquaintance with\r\nGerman literature; we not only admit—we are sure that it includes much\r\ncomic writing of which we know nothing.  We simply state the fact, that\r\nno German production of that kind, before the present century, ranked as\r\nEuropean; a fact which does not, indeed, determine the _amount_ of the\r\nnational facetiousness, but which is quite decisive as to its _quality_.\r\nWhatever may be the stock of fun which Germany yields for home\r\nconsumption, she has provided little for the palate of other lands.  All\r\nhonor to her for the still greater things she has done for us!  She has\r\nfought the hardest fight for freedom of thought, has produced the\r\ngrandest inventions, has made magnificent contributions to science, has\r\ngiven us some of the divinest poetry, and quite the divinest music in the\r\nworld.  No one reveres and treasures the products of the German mind more\r\nthan we do.  To say that that mind is not fertile in wit is only like\r\nsaying that excellent wheat land is not rich pasture; to say that we do\r\nnot enjoy German facetiousness is no more than to say that, though the\r\nhorse is the finest of quadrupeds, we do not like him to lay his hoof\r\nplayfully on our shoulder.  Still, as we have noticed that the pointless\r\npuns and stupid jocularity of the boy may ultimately be developed into\r\nthe epigrammatic brilliancy and polished playfulness of the man; as we\r\nbelieve that racy wit and chastened delicate humor are inevitably the\r\nresults of invigorated and refined mental activity, we can also believe\r\nthat Germany will, one day, yield a crop of wits and humorists.\r\n\r\nPerhaps there is already an earnest of that future crop in the existence\r\nof Heinrich Heine, a German born with the present century, who, to\r\nTeutonic imagination, sensibility, and humor, adds an amount of _esprit_\r\nthat would make him brilliant among the most brilliant of Frenchmen.\r\nTrue, this unique German wit is half a Hebrew; but he and his ancestors\r\nspent their youth in German air, and were reared on _Wurst_ and\r\n_Sauerkraut_, so that he is as much a German as a pheasant is an English\r\nbird, or a potato an Irish vegetable.  But whatever else he may be, Heine\r\nis one of the most remarkable men of this age: no echo, but a real voice,\r\nand therefore, like all genuine things in this world, worth studying; a\r\nsurpassing lyric poet, who has uttered our feelings for us in delicious\r\nsong; a humorist, who touches leaden folly with the magic wand of his\r\nfancy, and transmutes it into the fine gold of art—who sheds his sunny\r\nsmile on human tears, and makes them a beauteous rainbow on the cloudy\r\nbackground of life; a wit, who holds in his mighty hand the most\r\nscorching lightnings of satire; an artist in prose literature, who has\r\nshown even more completely than Goethe the possibilities of German prose;\r\nand—in spite of all charges against him, true as well as false—a lover of\r\nfreedom, who has spoken wise and brave words on behalf of his fellow-men.\r\nHe is, moreover, a suffering man, who, with all the highly-wrought\r\nsensibility of genius, has to endure terrible physical ills; and as such\r\nhe calls forth more than an intellectual interest.  It is true, alas!\r\nthat there is a heavy weight in the other scale—that Heine’s magnificent\r\npowers have often served only to give electric force to the expression of\r\ndebased feeling, so that his works are no Phidian statue of gold, and\r\nivory, and gems, but have not a little brass, and iron, and miry clay\r\nmingled with the precious metal.  The audacity of his occasional\r\ncoarseness and personality is unparalleled in contemporary literature,\r\nand has hardly been exceeded by the license of former days.  Hence,\r\nbefore his volumes are put within the reach of immature minds, there is\r\nneed of a friendly penknife to exercise a strict censorship.  Yet, when\r\nall coarseness, all scurrility, all Mephistophelean contempt for the\r\nreverent feelings of other men, is removed, there will be a plenteous\r\nremainder of exquisite poetry, of wit, humor, and just thought.  It is\r\napparently too often a congenial task to write severe words about the\r\ntransgressions committed by men of genius, especially when the censor has\r\nthe advantage of being himself a man of _no_ genius, so that those\r\ntransgressions seem to him quite gratuitous; _he_, forsooth, never\r\nlacerated any one by his wit, or gave irresistible piquancy to a coarse\r\nallusion, and his indignation is not mitigated by any knowledge of the\r\ntemptation that lies in transcendent power.  We are also apt to measure\r\nwhat a gifted man has done by our arbitrary conception of what he might\r\nhave done, rather than by a comparison of his actual doings with our own\r\nor those of other ordinary men.  We make ourselves overzealous agents of\r\nheaven, and demand that our brother should bring usurious interest for\r\nhis five Talents, forgetting that it is less easy to manage five Talents\r\nthan two.  Whatever benefit there may be in denouncing the evil, it is\r\nafter all more edifying, and certainly more cheering, to appreciate the\r\ngood.  Hence, in endeavoring to give our readers some account of Heine\r\nand his works, we shall not dwell lengthily on his failings; we shall not\r\nhold the candle up to dusty, vermin-haunted corners, but let the light\r\nfall as much as possible on the nobler and more attractive details.  Our\r\nsketch of Heine’s life, which has been drawn from various sources, will\r\nbe free from everything like intrusive gossip, and will derive its\r\ncoloring chiefly from the autobiographical hints and descriptions\r\nscattered through his own writings.  Those of our readers who happen to\r\nknow nothing of Heine will in this way be making their acquaintance with\r\nthe writer while they are learning the outline of his career.\r\n\r\nWe have said that Heine was born with the present century; but this\r\nstatement is not precise, for we learn that, according to his certificate\r\nof baptism, he was born December 12th, 1799.  However, as he himself\r\nsays, the important point is that he was born, and born on the banks of\r\nthe Rhine, at Düsseldorf, where his father was a merchant.  In his\r\n“Reisebilder” he gives us some recollections, in his wild poetic way, of\r\nthe dear old town where he spent his childhood, and of his schoolboy\r\ntroubles there.  We shall quote from these in butterfly fashion, sipping\r\na little nectar here and there, without regard to any strict order:\r\n\r\n    “I first saw the light on the banks of that lovely stream, where\r\n    Folly grows on the green hills, and in autumn is plucked, pressed,\r\n    poured into casks, and sent into foreign lands.  Believe me, I\r\n    yesterday heard some one utter folly which, in anno 1811, lay in a\r\n    bunch of grapes I then saw growing on the Johannisberg. . . . Mon\r\n    Dieu! if I had only such faith in me that I could remove mountains,\r\n    the Johannisberg would be the very mountain I should send for\r\n    wherever I might be; but as my faith is not so strong, imagination\r\n    must help me, and it transports me at once to the lovely Rhine. . . .\r\n    I am again a child, and playing with other children on the\r\n    Schlossplatz, at Düsseldorf on the Rhine.  Yes, madam, there was I\r\n    born; and I note this expressly, in case, after my death, seven\r\n    cities—Schilda, Krähwinkel, Polkwitz, Bockum, Dülken, Göttingen, and\r\n    Schöppenstädt—should contend for the honor of being my birthplace.\r\n    Düsseldorf is a town on the Rhine; sixteen thousand men live there,\r\n    and many hundred thousand men besides lie buried there. . . . . Among\r\n    them, many of whom my mother says, that it would be better if they\r\n    were still living; for example, my grandfather and my uncle, the old\r\n    Herr von Geldern and the young Herr von Geldern, both such celebrated\r\n    doctors, who saved so many men from death, and yet must die\r\n    themselves.  And the pious Ursula, who carried me in her arms when I\r\n    was a child, also lies buried there and a rosebush grows on her\r\n    grave; she loved the scent of roses so well in life, and her heart\r\n    was pure rose-incense and goodness.  The knowing old Canon, too, lies\r\n    buried there.  Heavens, what an object he looked when I last saw him!\r\n    _He was made up of nothing but mind and plasters_, and nevertheless\r\n    studied day and night, as if he were alarmed lest the worms should\r\n    find an idea too little in his head.  And the little William lies\r\n    there, and for this I am to blame.  We were schoolfellows in the\r\n    Franciscan monastery, and were playing on that side of it where the\r\n    Düssel flows between stone walls, and I said, ‘William, fetch out the\r\n    kitten that has just fallen in’—and merrily he went down on to the\r\n    plank which lay across the brook, snatched the kitten out of the\r\n    water, but fell in himself, and was dragged out dripping and dead.\r\n    _The kitten lived to a good old age_. . . . Princes in that day were\r\n    not the tormented race as they are now; the crown grew firmly on\r\n    their heads, and at night they drew a nightcap over it, and slept\r\n    peacefully, and peacefully slept the people at their feet; and when\r\n    the people waked in the morning, they said, ‘Good morning, father!’\r\n    and the princes answered, ‘Good morning, dear children!’  But it was\r\n    suddenly quite otherwise; for when we awoke one morning at\r\n    Düsseldorf, and were ready to say, ‘Good morning, father!’ lo! the\r\n    father was gone away; and in the whole town there was nothing but\r\n    dumb sorrow, everywhere a sort of funeral disposition; and people\r\n    glided along silently to the market, and read the long placard placed\r\n    on the door of the Town Hall.  It was dismal weather; yet the lean\r\n    tailor, Kilian, stood in his nankeen jacket which he usually wore\r\n    only in the house, and his blue worsted stockings hung down so that\r\n    his naked legs peeped out mournfully, and his thin lips trembled\r\n    while he muttered the announcement to himself.  And an old soldier\r\n    read rather louder, and at many a word a crystal tear trickled down\r\n    to his brave old mustache.  I stood near him and wept in company, and\r\n    asked him, ‘_Why we wept_?’  He answered, ‘The Elector has\r\n    abdicated.’  And then he read again, and at the words, ‘for the\r\n    long-manifested fidelity of my subjects,’ and ‘hereby set you free\r\n    from your allegiance,’ he wept more than ever.  It is strangely\r\n    touching to see an old man like that, with faded uniform and scarred\r\n    face, weep so bitterly all of a sudden.  While we were reading, the\r\n    electoral arms were taken down from the Town Hall; everything had\r\n    such a desolate air, that it was as if an eclipse of the sun were\r\n    expected. . . . I went home and wept, and wailed out, ‘The Elector\r\n    has abdicated!’  In vain my mother took a world of trouble to explain\r\n    the thing to me.  I knew what I knew; I was not to be persuaded, but\r\n    went crying to bed, and in the night dreamed that the world was at an\r\n    end.”\r\n\r\nThe next morning, however, the sun rises as usual, and Joachim Murat is\r\nproclaimed Grand Duke, whereupon there is a holiday at the public school,\r\nand Heinrich (or Harry, for that was his baptismal name, which he\r\nafterward had the good taste to change), perched on the bronze horse of\r\nthe Electoral statue, sees quite a different scene from yesterday’s:\r\n\r\n    “The next day the world was again all in order, and we had school as\r\n    before, and things were got by heart as before—the Roman emperors,\r\n    chronology, the nouns in _im_, the _verba irregularia_, Greek,\r\n    Hebrew, geography, mental arithmetic!—heavens! my head is still dizzy\r\n    with it—all must be learned by heart!  And a great deal of this came\r\n    very conveniently for me in after life.  For if I had not known the\r\n    Roman kings by heart, it would subsequently have been quite\r\n    indifferent to me whether Niebuhr had proved or had not proved that\r\n    they never really existed. . . . But oh! the trouble I had at school\r\n    with the endless dates.  And with arithmetic it was still worse.\r\n    What I understood best was subtraction, for that has a very practical\r\n    rule: ‘Four can’t be taken from three, therefore I must borrow one.’\r\n    But I advise every one in such a case to borrow a few extra pence,\r\n    for no one can tell what may happen. . . . As for Latin, you have no\r\n    idea, madam, what a complicated affair it is.  The Romans would never\r\n    have found time to conquer the world if they had first had to learn\r\n    Latin.  Luckily for them, they already knew in their cradles what\r\n    nouns have their accusative in _im_.  I, on the contrary, had to\r\n    learn them by heart in the sweat of my brow; nevertheless, it is\r\n    fortunate for me that I know them . . . and the fact that I have them\r\n    at my finger-ends if I should ever happen to want them suddenly,\r\n    affords me much inward repose and consolation in many troubled hours\r\n    of life. . . . Of Greek I will not say a word, I should get too much\r\n    irritated.  The monks in the Middle Ages were not so far wrong when\r\n    they maintained that Greek was an invention of the devil.  God knows\r\n    the suffering I endured over it. . . . With Hebrew it went somewhat\r\n    better, for I had always a great liking for the Jews, though to this\r\n    very hour they crucify my good name; but I could never get on so far\r\n    in Hebrew as my watch, which had much familiar intercourse with\r\n    pawnbrokers, and in this way contracted many Jewish habits—for\r\n    example, it wouldn’t go on Saturdays.”\r\n\r\nHeine’s parents were apparently not wealthy, but his education was cared\r\nfor by his uncle, Solomon Heine, a great banker in Hamburg, so that he\r\nhad no early pecuniary disadvantages to struggle with.  He seems to have\r\nbeen very happy in his mother, who was not of Hebrew but of Teutonic\r\nblood; he often mentions her with reverence and affection, and in the\r\n“Buch der Lieder” there are two exquisite sonnets addressed to her, which\r\ntell how his proud spirit was always subdued by the charm of her\r\npresence, and how her love was the home of his heart after restless weary\r\nramblings:\r\n\r\n    “Wie mächtig auch mein stolzer Muth sich blähe,\r\n    In deiner selig süssen, trauten Nahe\r\n    Ergreift mich oft ein demuthvolles Zagen.\r\n\r\n    * * * * *\r\n\r\n    Und immer irrte ich nach Liebe, immer\r\n    Nach Liebe, doch die Liebe fand ich nimmer,\r\n    Und kehrte um nach Hause, krank und trübe.\r\n    Doch da bist du entgegen mir gekommen,\r\n    Und ach! was da in deinem Aug’ geschwommen,\r\n    Das war die süsse, langgesuchte Liebe.”\r\n\r\nHe was at first destined for a mercantile life, but Nature declared too\r\nstrongly against this plan.  “God knows,” he has lately said in\r\nconversation with his brother, “I would willingly have become a banker,\r\nbut I could never bring myself to that pass.  I very early discerned that\r\nbankers would one day be the rulers of the world.”  So commerce was at\r\nlength given up for law, the study of which he began in 1819 at the\r\nUniversity of Bonn.  He had already published some poems in the corner of\r\na newspaper, and among them was one on Napoleon, the object of his\r\nyouthful enthusiasm.  This poem, he says in a letter to St. Réné\r\nTaillandier, was written when he was only sixteen.  It is still to be\r\nfound in the “Buch der Lieder” under the title “Die Grenadiere,” and it\r\nproves that even in its earliest efforts his genius showed a strongly\r\nspecific character.\r\n\r\nIt will be easily imagined that the germs of poetry sprouted too\r\nvigorously in Heine’s brain for jurisprudence to find much room there.\r\nLectures on history and literature, we are told, were more diligently\r\nattended than lectures on law.  He had taken care, too, to furnish his\r\ntrunk with abundant editions of the poets, and the poet he especially\r\nstudied at that time was Byron.  At a later period, we find his taste\r\ntaking another direction, for he writes, “Of all authors, Byron is\r\nprecisely the one who excites in me the most intolerable emotion; whereas\r\nScott, in every one of his works, gladdens my heart, soothes, and\r\ninvigorates me.”  Another indication of his bent in these Bonn days was a\r\nnewspaper essay, in which he attacked the Romantic school; and here also\r\nhe went through that chicken-pox of authorship—the production of a\r\ntragedy.  Heine’s tragedy—_Almansor_—is, as might be expected, better\r\nthan the majority of these youthful mistakes.  The tragic collision lies\r\nin the conflict between natural affection and the deadly hatred of\r\nreligion and of race—in the sacrifice of youthful lovers to the strife\r\nbetween Moor and Spaniard, Moslem and Christian.  Some of the situations\r\nare striking, and there are passages of considerable poetic merit; but\r\nthe characters are little more than shadowy vehicles for the poetry, and\r\nthere is a want of clearness and probability in the structure.  It was\r\npublished two years later, in company with another tragedy, in one act,\r\ncalled _William Ratcliffe_, in which there is rather a feeble use of the\r\nScotch second-sight after the manner of the Fate in the Greek tragedy.\r\nWe smile to find Heine saying of his tragedies, in a letter to a friend\r\nsoon after their publication: “I know they will be terribly cut up, but I\r\nwill confess to you in confidence that they are very good, better than my\r\ncollection of poems, which are not worth a shot.”  Elsewhere he tells us,\r\nthat when, after one of Paganini’s concerts, he was passionately\r\ncomplimenting the great master on his violin-playing.  Paganini\r\ninterrupted him thus: “But how were you pleased with my _bows_?”\r\n\r\nIn 1820 Heine left Bonn for Göttingen.  He there pursued his omission of\r\nlaw studies, and at the end of three months he was rusticated for a\r\nbreach of the laws against duelling.  While there, he had attempted a\r\nnegotiation with Brockhaus for the printing of a volume of poems, and had\r\nendured the first ordeal of lovers and poets—a refusal.  It was not until\r\na year after that he found a Berlin publisher for his first volume of\r\npoems, subsequently transformed, with additions, into the “Buch der\r\nLieder.”  He remained between two and three years at Berlin, and the\r\nsociety he found there seems to have made these years an important epoch\r\nin his culture.  He was one of the youngest members of a circle which\r\nassembled at the house of the poetess Elise von Hohenhausen, the\r\ntranslator of Byron—a circle which included Chamisso, Varnhagen, and\r\nRahel (Varnhagen’s wife).  For Rahel, Heine had a profound admiration and\r\nregard; he afterward dedicated to her the poems included under the tide\r\n“Heimkehr;” and he frequently refers to her or quotes her in a way that\r\nindicates how he valued her influence.  According to his friend F. von\r\nHohenhausen, the opinions concerning Heine’s talent were very various\r\namong his Berlin friends, and it was only a small minority that had any\r\npresentiment of his future fame.  In this minority was Elise von\r\nHohenhausen, who proclaimed Heine as the Byron of Germany; but her\r\nopinion was met with much head-shaking and opposition.  We can imagine\r\nhow precious was such a recognition as hers to the young poet, then only\r\ntwo or three and twenty, and with by no means an impressive personality\r\nfor superficial eyes.  Perhaps even the deep-sighted were far from\r\ndetecting in that small, blonde, pale young man, with quiet, gentle\r\nmanners, the latent powers of ridicule and sarcasm—the terrible talons\r\nthat were one day to be thrust out from the velvet paw of the young\r\nleopard.\r\n\r\nIt was apparently during this residence in Berlin that Heine united\r\nhimself with the Lutheran Church.  He would willingly, like many of his\r\nfriends, he tells us, have remained free from all ecclesiastical ties if\r\nthe authorities there had not forbidden residence in Prussia, and\r\nespecially in Berlin, to every one who did not belong to one of the\r\npositive religions recognized by the State.\r\n\r\n    “As Henry IV. once laughingly said, ‘_Paris vaut bien une messe_,’ so\r\n    I might with reason say, ‘_Berlin vaut bien une prêche_;’ and I could\r\n    afterward, as before, accommodate myself to the very enlightened\r\n    Christianity, filtrated from all superstition, which could then be\r\n    had in the churches of Berlin, and which was even free from the\r\n    divinity of Christ, like turtle-soup without turtle.”\r\n\r\nAt the same period, too, Heine became acquainted with Hegel.  In his\r\nlately published “Geständnisse” (Confessions) he throws on Hegel’s\r\ninfluence over him the blue light of demoniacal wit, and confounds us by\r\nthe most bewildering double-edged sarcasms; but that influence seems to\r\nhave been at least more wholesome than the one which produced the mocking\r\nretractations of the “Geständnisse.”  Through all his self-satire, we\r\ndiscern that in those days he had something like real earnestness and\r\nenthusiasm, which are certainly not apparent in his present theistic\r\nconfession of faith.\r\n\r\n    “On the whole, I never felt a strong enthusiasm for this philosophy,\r\n    and conviction on the subject was out of question.  I never was an\r\n    abstract thinker, and I accepted the synthesis of the Hegelian\r\n    doctrine without demanding any proof; since its consequences\r\n    flattered my vanity.  I was young and proud, and it pleased my\r\n    vainglory when I learned from Hegel that the true God was not, as my\r\n    grandmother believed, the God who lives in heaven, but myself here\r\n    upon earth.  This foolish pride had not in the least a pernicious\r\n    influence on my feelings; on the contrary, it heightened these to the\r\n    pitch of heroism.  I was at that time so lavish in generosity and\r\n    self-sacrifice that I must assuredly have eclipsed the most brilliant\r\n    deeds of those good _bourgeois_ of virtue who acted merely from a\r\n    sense of duty, and simply obeyed the laws of morality.”\r\n\r\nHis sketch of Hegel is irresistibly amusing; but we must warn the reader\r\nthat Heine’s anecdotes are often mere devices of style by which he\r\nconveys his satire or opinions.  The reader will see that he does not\r\nneglect an opportunity of giving a sarcastic lash or two, in passing, to\r\nMeyerbeer, for whose music he has a great contempt.  The sarcasm conveyed\r\nin the substitution of _reputation_ for _music_ and _journalists_ for\r\n_musicians_, might perhaps escape any one unfamiliar with the sly and\r\nunexpected turns of Heine’s ridicule.\r\n\r\n    “To speak frankly, I seldom understood him, and only arrived at the\r\n    meaning of his words by subsequent reflection.  I believe he wished\r\n    not to be understood; and hence his practice of sprinkling his\r\n    discourse with modifying parentheses; hence, perhaps, his preference\r\n    for persons of whom he knew that they did not understand him, and to\r\n    whom he all the more willingly granted the honor of his familiar\r\n    acquaintance.  Thus every one in Berlin wondered at the intimate\r\n    companionship of the profound Hegel with the late Heinrich Beer, a\r\n    brother of Giacomo Meyerbeer, who is universally known by his\r\n    reputation, and who has been celebrated by the cleverest journalists.\r\n    This Beer, namely Heinrich, was a thoroughly stupid fellow, and\r\n    indeed was afterward actually declared imbecile by his family, and\r\n    placed under guardianship, because instead of making a name for\r\n    himself in art or in science by means of his great fortune, he\r\n    squandered his money on childish trifles; and, for example, one day\r\n    bought six thousand thalers’ worth of walking-sticks.  This poor man,\r\n    who had no wish to pass either for a great tragic dramatist, or for a\r\n    great star-gazer, or for a laurel-crowned musical genius, a rival of\r\n    Mozart and Rossini, and preferred giving his money for\r\n    walking-sticks—this degenerate Beer enjoyed Hegel’s most confidential\r\n    society; he was the philosopher’s bosom friend, his Pylades, and\r\n    accompanied him everywhere like his shadow.  The equally witty and\r\n    gifted Felix Mendelssohn once sought to explain this phenomenon, by\r\n    maintaining that Hegel did not understand Heinrich Beer.  I now\r\n    believe, however, that the real ground of that intimacy consisted in\r\n    this—Hegel was convinced that no word of what he said was understood\r\n    by Heinrich Beer; and he could therefore, in his presence, give\r\n    himself up to all the intellectual outpourings of the moment.  In\r\n    general, Hegel’s conversation was a sort of monologue, sighed forth\r\n    by starts in a noiseless voice; the odd roughness of his expressions\r\n    often struck me, and many of them have remained in my memory.  One\r\n    beautiful starlight evening we stood together at the window, and I, a\r\n    young man of one-and-twenty, having just had a good dinner and\r\n    finished my coffee, spoke with enthusiasm of the stars, and called\r\n    them the habitations of the departed.  But the master muttered to\r\n    himself, ‘The stars! hum! hum!  The stars are only a brilliant\r\n    leprosy on the face of the heavens.’  ‘For God’s sake,’ I cried, ‘is\r\n    there, then, no happy place above, where virtue is rewarded after\r\n    death?’  But he, staring at me with his pale eyes, said, cuttingly,\r\n    ‘So you want a bonus for having taken care of your sick mother, and\r\n    refrained from poisoning your worthy brother?’  At these words he\r\n    looked anxiously round, but appeared immediately set at rest when he\r\n    observed that it was only Heinrich Beer, who had approached to invite\r\n    him to a game at whist.”\r\n\r\nIn 1823 Heine returned to Göttingen to complete his career as a\r\nlaw-student, and this time he gave evidence of advanced mental maturity,\r\nnot only by producing many of the charming poems subsequently included in\r\nthe “Reisebilder,” but also by prosecuting his professional studies\r\ndiligently enough to leave Göttingen, in 1825, as _Doctor juris_.\r\nHereupon he settled at Hamburg as an advocate, but his profession seems\r\nto have been the least pressing of his occupations.  In those days a\r\nsmall blonde young man, with the brim of his hat drawn over his nose, his\r\ncoat flying open, and his hands stuck in his trousers pockets, might be\r\nseen stumbling along the streets of Hamburg, staring from side to side,\r\nand appearing to have small regard to the figure he made in the eyes of\r\nthe good citizens.  Occasionally an inhabitant more literary than usual\r\nwould point out this young man to his companion as _Heinrich Heine_; but\r\nin general the young poet had not to endure the inconveniences of being a\r\nlion.  His poems were devoured, but he was not asked to devour flattery\r\nin return.  Whether because the fair Hamburgers acted in the spirit of\r\nJohnson’s advice to Hannah More—to “consider what her flattery was worth\r\nbefore she choked him with it”—or for some other reason, Heine, according\r\nto the testimony of August Lewald, to whom we owe these particulars of\r\nhis Hamburg life, was left free from the persecution of tea-parties.\r\nNot, however, from another persecution of Genius—nervous headaches, which\r\nsome persons, we are told, regarded as an improbable fiction, intended as\r\na pretext for raising a delicate white hand to his forehead.  It is\r\nprobable that the sceptical persons alluded to were themselves untroubled\r\nwith nervous headaches, and that their hands were _not_ delicate.  Slight\r\ndetails, these, but worth telling about a man of genius, because they\r\nhelp us to keep in mind that he is, after all, our brother, having to\r\nendure the petty every-day ills of life as we have; with this difference,\r\nthat his heightened sensibility converts what are mere insect stings for\r\nus into scorpion stings for him.\r\n\r\nIt was, perhaps, in these Hamburg days that Heine paid the visit to\r\nGoethe, of which he gives us this charming little picture:\r\n\r\n    “When I visited him in Weimar, and stood before him, I involuntarily\r\n    glanced at his side to see whether the eagle was not there with the\r\n    lightning in his beak.  I was nearly speaking Greek to him; but, as I\r\n    observed that he understood German, I stated to him in German that\r\n    the plums on the road between Jena and Weimar were very good.  I had\r\n    for so many long winter nights thought over what lofty and profound\r\n    things I would say to Goethe, if ever I saw him.  And when I saw him\r\n    at last, I said to him, that the Saxon plums were very good!  And\r\n    Goethe smiled.”\r\n\r\nDuring the next few years Heine produced the most popular of all his\r\nworks—those which have won him his place as the greatest of living German\r\npoets and humorists.  Between 1826 and 1829 appeared the four volumes of\r\nthe “Reisebilder” (Pictures of Travel) and the “Buch der Lieder” (Book of\r\nSongs), a volume of lyrics, of which it is hard to say whether their\r\ngreatest charm is the lightness and finish of their style, their vivid\r\nand original imaginativeness, or their simple, pure sensibility.  In his\r\n“Reisebilder” Heine carries us with him to the Hartz, to the isle of\r\nNorderney, to his native town Düsseldorf, to Italy, and to England,\r\nsketching scenery and character, now with the wildest, most fantastic\r\nhumor, now with the finest idyllic sensibility—letting his thoughts\r\nwander from poetry to politics, from criticism to dreamy reverie, and\r\nblending fun, imagination, reflection, and satire in a sort of exquisite,\r\never-varying shimmer, like the hues of the opal.\r\n\r\nHeine’s journey to England did not at all heighten his regard for the\r\nEnglish.  He calls our language the “hiss of egoism (_Zischlaute des\r\nEgoismus_); and his ridicule of English awkwardness is as merciless\r\nas—English ridicule of German awkwardness.  His antipathy toward us seems\r\nto have grown in intensity, like many of his other antipathies; and in\r\nhis “Vermischte Schriften” he is more bitter than ever.  Let us quote one\r\nof his philippics, since bitters are understood to be wholesome:\r\n\r\n    “It is certainly a frightful injustice to pronounce sentence of\r\n    condemnation on an entire people.  But with regard to the English,\r\n    momentary disgust might betray me into this injustice; and on looking\r\n    at the mass I easily forget the many brave and noble men who\r\n    distinguished themselves by intellect and love of freedom.  But\r\n    these, especially the British poets, were always all the more\r\n    glaringly in contrast with the rest of the nation; they were isolated\r\n    martyrs to their national relations; and, besides, great geniuses do\r\n    not belong to the particular land of their birth: they scarcely\r\n    belong to this earth, the Golgotha of their sufferings.  The mass—the\r\n    English blockheads, God forgive me!—are hateful to me in my inmost\r\n    soul; and I often regard them not at all as my fellow-men, but as\r\n    miserable automata—machines, whose motive power is egoism.  In these\r\n    moods, it seems to me as if I heard the whizzing wheelwork by which\r\n    they think, feel, reckon, digest, and pray: their praying, their\r\n    mechanical Anglican church-going, with the gilt Prayer-book under\r\n    their arms, their stupid, tiresome Sunday, their awkward piety, is\r\n    most of all odious to me.  I am firmly convinced that a blaspheming\r\n    Frenchman is a more pleasing sight for the Divinity than a praying\r\n    Englishman.”\r\n\r\nOn his return from England Heine was employed at Munich in editing the\r\n_Allgemeinen Politischen Annalen_, but in 1830 he was again in the north,\r\nand the news of the July Revolution surprised him on the island of\r\nHeligoland.  He has given us a graphic picture of his democratic\r\nenthusiasm in those days in some letters, apparently written from\r\nHeligoland, which he has inserted in his book on Börne.  We quote some\r\npassages, not only for their biographic interest as showing a phase of\r\nHeine’s mental history, but because they are a specimen of his power in\r\nthat kind of dithyrambic writing which, in less masterly hands, easily\r\nbecomes ridiculous:\r\n\r\n    “The thick packet of newspapers arrived from the Continent with these\r\n    warm, glowing-hot tidings.  They were sunbeams wrapped up in\r\n    packing-paper, and they inflamed my soul till it burst into the\r\n    wildest conflagration. . . . It is all like a dream to me; especially\r\n    the name Lafayette sounds to me like a legend out of my earliest\r\n    childhood.  Does he really sit again on horseback, commanding the\r\n    National Guard?  I almost fear it may not be true, for it is in\r\n    print.  I will myself go to Paris, to be convinced of it with my\r\n    bodily eyes. . . . It must be splendid, when he rides through the\r\n    street, the citizen of two worlds, the godlike old man, with his\r\n    silver locks streaming down his sacred shoulder. . . . He greets,\r\n    with his dear old eyes, the grandchildren of those who once fought\r\n    with him for freedom and equality. . . . It is now sixty years since\r\n    he returned from America with the Declaration of Human Rights, the\r\n    decalogue of the world’s new creed, which was revealed to him amid\r\n    the thunders and lightnings of cannon. . . . And the tricolored flag\r\n    waves again on the towers of Paris, and its streets resound with the\r\n    Marseillaise! . . . It is all over with my yearning for repose.  I\r\n    now know again what I will do, what I ought to do, what I must do. .\r\n    . . I am the son of the Revolution, and seize again the hallowed\r\n    weapons on which my mother pronounced her magic benediction. . . .\r\n    Flowers! flowers! I will crown my head for the death-fight.  And the\r\n    lyre too, reach me the lyre, that I may sing a battle-song. . . .\r\n    Words like flaming stars, that shoot down from the heavens, and burn\r\n    up the palaces, and illuminate the huts. . . . Words like bright\r\n    javelins, that whirr up to the seventh heaven and strike the pious\r\n    hypocrites who have skulked into the Holy of Holies. . . . I am all\r\n    joy and song, all sword and flame!  Perhaps, too, all delirium. . . .\r\n    One of those sunbeams wrapped in brown paper has flown to my brain,\r\n    and set my thoughts aglow.  In vain I dip my head into the sea.  No\r\n    water extinguishes this Greek fire: . . . Even the poor Heligolanders\r\n    shout for joy, although they have only a sort of dim instinct of what\r\n    has occurred.  The fisherman who yesterday took me over to the little\r\n    sand island, which is the bathing-place here, said to me smilingly,\r\n    ‘The poor people have won!’  Yes; instinctively the people comprehend\r\n    such events, perhaps, better than we, with all our means of\r\n    knowledge.  Thus Frau von Varnhagen once told me that when the issue\r\n    of the Battle of Leipzig was not yet known, the maid-servant suddenly\r\n    rushed into the room with the sorrowful cry, ‘The nobles have won!’ .\r\n    . . This morning another packet of newspapers is come, I devour them\r\n    like manna.  Child that I am, affecting details touch me yet more\r\n    than the momentous whole.  Oh, if I could but see the dog Medor. . .\r\n    . The dog Medor brought his master his gun and cartridge-box, and\r\n    when his master fell, and was buried with his fellow-heroes in the\r\n    Court of the Louvre, there stayed the poor dog like a monument of\r\n    faithfulness, sitting motionless on the grave, day and night, eating\r\n    but little of the food that was offered him—burying the greater part\r\n    of it in the earth, perhaps as nourishment for his buried master!”\r\n\r\nThe enthusiasm which was kept thus at boiling heat by imagination, cooled\r\ndown rapidly when brought into contact with reality.  In the same book he\r\nindicates, in his caustic way, the commencement of that change in his\r\npolitical _temperature_—for it cannot be called a change in opinion—which\r\nhas drawn down on him immense vituperation from some of the patriotic\r\nparty, but which seems to have resulted simply from the essential\r\nantagonism between keen wit and fanaticism.\r\n\r\n    “On the very first days of my arrival in Paris I observed that things\r\n    wore, in reality, quite different colors from those which had been\r\n    shed on them, when in perspective, by the light of my enthusiasm.\r\n    The silver locks which I saw fluttering so majestically on the\r\n    shoulders of Lafayette, the hero of two worlds, were metamorphosed\r\n    into a brown perruque, which made a pitiable covering for a narrow\r\n    skull.  And even the dog Medor, which I visited in the Court of the\r\n    Louvre, and which, encamped under tricolored flags and trophies, very\r\n    quietly allowed himself to be fed—he was not at all the right dog,\r\n    but quite an ordinary brute, who assumed to himself merits not his\r\n    own, as often happens with the French; and, like many others, he made\r\n    a profit out of the glory of the Revolution. . . .  He was pampered\r\n    and patronized, perhaps promoted to the highest posts, while the true\r\n    Medor, some days after the battle, modestly slunk out of sight, like\r\n    the true people who created the Revolution.”\r\n\r\nThat it was not merely interest in French politics which sent Heine to\r\nParis in 1831, but also a perception that German air was not friendly to\r\nsympathizers in July revolutions, is humorously intimated in the\r\n“Geständnisse.”\r\n\r\n    “I had done much and suffered much, and when the sun of the July\r\n    Revolution arose in France, I had become very weary, and needed some\r\n    recreation.  Also, my native air was every day more unhealthy for me,\r\n    and it was time I should seriously think of a change of climate.  I\r\n    had visions: the clouds terrified me, and made all sorts of ugly\r\n    faces at me.  It often seemed to me as if the sun were a Prussian\r\n    cockade; at night I dreamed of a hideous black eagle, which gnawed my\r\n    liver; and I was very melancholy.  Add to this, I had become\r\n    acquainted with an old Berlin Justizrath, who had spent many years in\r\n    the fortress of Spandau, and he related to me how unpleasant it is\r\n    when one is obliged to wear irons in winter.  For myself I thought it\r\n    very unchristian that the irons were not warmed a trifle.  If the\r\n    irons were warmed a little for us they would not make so unpleasant\r\n    an impression, and even chilly natures might then bear them very\r\n    well; it would be only proper consideration, too, if the fetters were\r\n    perfumed with essence of roses and laurels, as is the case in this\r\n    country (France).  I asked my Justizrath whether he often got oysters\r\n    to eat at Spandau?  He said, No; Spandau was too far from the sea.\r\n    Moreover, he said meat was very scarce there, and there was no kind\r\n    of _volaille_ except flies, which fell into one’s soup. . . . Now, as\r\n    I really needed some recreation, and as Spandau is too far from the\r\n    sea for oysters to be got there, and the Spandau fly-soup did not\r\n    seem very appetizing to me, as, besides all this, the Prussian chains\r\n    are very cold in winter, and could not be conducive to my health, I\r\n    resolved to visit Paris.”\r\n\r\nSince this time Paris has been Heine’s home, and his best prose works\r\nhave been written either to inform the Germans on French affairs or to\r\ninform the French on German philosophy and literature.  He became a\r\ncorrespondent of the _Allgemeine Zeitung_, and his correspondence, which\r\nextends, with an interruption of several years, from 1831 to 1844, forms\r\nthe volume entitled “Französische Zustände” (French Affairs), and the\r\nsecond and third volume of his “Vermischte Schriften.”  It is a witty and\r\noften wise commentary on public men and public events: Louis Philippe,\r\nCasimir Périer, Thiers, Guizot, Rothschild, the Catholic party, the\r\nSocialist party, have their turn of satire and appreciation, for Heine\r\ndeals out both with an impartiality which made his less favorable\r\ncritics—Börne, for example—charge him with the rather incompatible sins\r\nof reckless caprice and venality.  Literature and art alternate with\r\npolitics: we have now a sketch of George Sand or a description of one of\r\nHorace Vernet’s pictures; now a criticism of Victor Hugo or of Liszt; now\r\nan irresistible caricature of Spontini or Kalkbrenner; and occasionally\r\nthe predominant satire is relieved by a fine saying or a genial word of\r\nadmiration.  And all is done with that airy lightness, yet precision of\r\ntouch, which distinguishes Heine beyond any living writer.  The charge of\r\nvenality was loudly made against Heine in Germany: first, it was said\r\nthat he was paid to write; then, that he was paid to abstain from\r\nwriting; and the accusations were supposed to have an irrefragable basis\r\nin the fact that he accepted a stipend from the French government.  He\r\nhas never attempted to conceal the reception of that stipend, and we\r\nthink his statement (in the “Vermischte Schriften”) of the circumstances\r\nunder which it was offered and received, is a sufficient vindication of\r\nhimself and M. Guizot from any dishonor in the matter.\r\n\r\nIt may be readily imagined that Heine, with so large a share of the\r\nGallic element as he has in his composition, was soon at his ease in\r\nParisian society, and the years here were bright with intellectual\r\nactivity and social enjoyment.  “His wit,” wrote August Lewald, “is a\r\nperpetual gushing fountain; he throws off the most delicious descriptions\r\nwith amazing facility, and sketches the most comic characters in\r\nconversations.”  Such a man could not be neglected in Paris, and Heine\r\nwas sought on all sides—as a guest in distinguished salons, as a possible\r\nproselyte in the circle of the Saint Simonians.  His literary\r\nproductiveness seems to have been furthered by his congenial life, which,\r\nhowever, was soon to some extent embittered by the sense of exile; for\r\nsince 1835 both his works and his person have been the object of\r\ndenunciation by the German governments.  Between 1833 and 1845 appeared\r\nthe four volumes of the “Salon,” “Die Romantische Schule” (both written,\r\nin the first instance, in French), the book on Börne, “Atta Troll,” a\r\nromantic poem, “Deutschland,” an exquisitely humorous poem, describing\r\nhis last visit to Germany, and containing some grand passages of serious\r\nwriting; and the “Neue Gedichte,” a collection of lyrical poems.  Among\r\nthe most interesting of his prose works are the second volume of the\r\n“Salon,” which contains a survey of religion and philosophy in Germany,\r\nand the “Romantische Schule,” a delightful introduction to that phase of\r\nGerman literature known as the Romantic school.  The book on Börne, which\r\nappeared in 1840, two years after the death of that writer, excited great\r\nindignation in Germany, as a wreaking of vengeance on the dead, an insult\r\nto the memory of a man who had worked and suffered in the cause of\r\nfreedom—a cause which was Heine’s own.  Börne, we may observe\r\nparenthetically for the information of those who are not familiar with\r\nrecent German literature, was a remarkable political writer of the\r\nultra-liberal party in Germany, who resided in Paris at the same time\r\nwith Heine: a man of stern, uncompromising partisanship and bitter humor.\r\nWithout justifying Heine’s production of this book, we see excuses for\r\nhim which should temper the condemnation passed on it.  There was a\r\nradical opposition of nature between him and Börne; to use his own\r\ndistinction, Heine is a Hellene—sensuous, realistic, exquisitely alive to\r\nthe beautiful; while Börne was a Nazarene—ascetic, spiritualistic,\r\ndespising the pure artist as destitute of earnestness.  Heine has too\r\nkeen a perception of practical absurdities and damaging exaggerations\r\never to become a thoroughgoing partisan; and with a love of freedom, a\r\nfaith in the ultimate triumph of democratic principles, of which we see\r\nno just reason to doubt the genuineness and consistency, he has been\r\nunable to satisfy more zealous and one-sided liberals by giving his\r\nadhesion to their views and measures, or by adopting a denunciatory tone\r\nagainst those in the opposite ranks.  Börne could not forgive what he\r\nregarded as Heine’s epicurean indifference and artistic dalliance, and he\r\nat length gave vent to his antipathy in savage attacks on him through the\r\npress, accusing him of utterly lacking character and principle, and even\r\nof writing under the influence of venal motives.  To these attacks Heine\r\nremained absolutely mute—from contempt according to his own account; but\r\nthe retort, which he resolutely refrained from making during Börne’s\r\nlife, comes in this volume published after his death with the\r\nconcentrated force of long-gathering thunder.  The utterly inexcusable\r\npart of the book is the caricature of Börne’s friend, Madame Wohl, and\r\nthe scurrilous insinuations concerning Börne’s domestic life.  It is\r\nsaid, we know not with how much truth, that Heine had to answer for these\r\nin a duel with Madame Wohl’s husband, and that, after receiving a serious\r\nwound, he promised to withdraw the offensive matter from a future\r\nedition.  That edition, however, has not been called for.  Whatever else\r\nwe may think of the book, it is impossible to deny its transcendent\r\ntalent—the dramatic vigor with which Börne is made present to us, the\r\ncritical acumen with which he is characterized, and the wonderful play of\r\nwit, pathos, and thought which runs through the whole.  But we will let\r\nHeine speak for himself, and first we will give part of his graphic\r\ndescription of the way in which Börne’s mind and manners grated on his\r\ntaste:\r\n\r\n    “To the disgust which, in intercourse with Börne, I was in danger of\r\n    feeling toward those who surrounded him, was added the annoyance I\r\n    felt from his perpetual talk about politics.  Nothing but political\r\n    argument, and again political argument, even at table, where he\r\n    managed to hunt me out.  At dinner, when I so gladly forget all the\r\n    vexations of the world, he spoiled the best dishes for me by his\r\n    patriotic gall, which he poured as a bitter sauce over everything.\r\n    Calf’s feet, _à la maître d’hôtel_, then my innocent _bonne bouche_,\r\n    he completely spoiled for me by Job’s tidings from Germany, which he\r\n    scraped together out of the most unreliable newspapers.  And then his\r\n    accursed remarks, which spoiled one’s appetite! . . . This was a sort\r\n    of table-talk which did not greatly exhilarate me, and I avenged\r\n    myself by affecting an excessive, almost impassioned indifference for\r\n    the object of Börne’s enthusiasm.  For example, Börne was indignant\r\n    that immediately on my arrival in Paris I had nothing better to do\r\n    than to write for German papers a long account of the Exhibition of\r\n    Pictures.  I omit all discussion as to whether that interest in Art\r\n    which induced me to undertake this work was so utterly irreconcilable\r\n    with the revolutionary interests of the day; but Börne saw in it a\r\n    proof of my indifference toward the sacred cause of humanity, and I\r\n    could in my turn spoil the taste of his patriotic _sauerkraut_ for\r\n    him by talking all dinner-time of nothing but pictures, of Robert’s\r\n    ‘Reapers,’ Horace Vernet’s ‘Judith,’ and Scheffer’s ‘Faust.’ . . .\r\n    That I never thought it worth while to discuss my political\r\n    principles with him it is needless to say; and once when he declared\r\n    that he had found a contradiction in my writings, I satisfied myself\r\n    with the ironical answer, ‘You are mistaken, _mon cher_; such\r\n    contradictions never occur in my works, for always before I begin to\r\n    write, I read over the statement of my political principles in my\r\n    previous writings, that I may not contradict myself, and that no one\r\n    may be able to reproach me with apostasy from my liberal\r\n    principles.’”\r\n\r\nAnd here is his own account of the spirit in which the book was written:\r\n\r\n    “I was never Börne’s friend, nor was I ever his enemy.  The\r\n    displeasure which he could often excite in me was never very\r\n    important, and he atoned for it sufficiently by the cold silence\r\n    which I opposed to all his accusations and raillery.  While he lived\r\n    I wrote not a line against him, I never thought about him, I ignored\r\n    him completely; and that enraged him beyond measure.  If I now speak\r\n    of him, I do so neither out of enthusiasm nor out of uneasiness; I am\r\n    conscious of the coolest impartiality.  I write here neither an\r\n    apology nor a critique, and as in painting the man I go on my own\r\n    observation, the image I present of him ought perhaps to be regarded\r\n    as a real portrait.  And such a monument is due to him—to the great\r\n    wrestler who, in the arena of our political games, wrestled so\r\n    courageously, and earned, if not the laurel, certainly the crown of\r\n    oak leaves.  I give an image with his true features, without\r\n    idealization—the more like him the more honorable for his memory.  He\r\n    was neither a genius nor a hero; he was no Olympian god.  He was a\r\n    man, a denizen of this earth; he was a good writer and a great\r\n    patriot. . . . Beautiful, delicious peace, which I feel at this\r\n    moment in the depths of my soul!  Thou rewardest me sufficiently for\r\n    everything I have done and for everything I have despised. . . . I\r\n    shall defend myself neither from the reproach of indifference nor\r\n    from the suspicion of venality.  I have for years, during the life of\r\n    the insinuator, held such self-justification unworthy of me; now even\r\n    decency demands silence.  That would be a frightful\r\n    spectacle!—polemics between Death and Exile!  Dost thou stretch out\r\n    to me a beseeching hand from the grave?  Without rancor I reach mine\r\n    toward thee. . . . See how noble it is and pure!  It was never soiled\r\n    by pressing the hands of the mob, any more than by the impure gold of\r\n    the people’s enemy.  In reality thou hast never injured me. . . . In\r\n    all thy insinuations there is not a _louis d’or’s_ worth of truth.”\r\n\r\nIn one of these years Heine was married, and, in deference to the\r\nsentiments of his wife, married according to the rites of the Catholic\r\nChurch.  On this fact busy rumor afterward founded the story of his\r\nconversion to Catholicism, and could of course name the day and spot on\r\nwhich he abjured Protestanism.  In his “Geständnisse” Heine publishes a\r\ndenial of this rumor; less, he says, for the sake of depriving the\r\nCatholics of the solace they may derive from their belief in a new\r\nconvert, than in order to cut off from another party the more spiteful\r\nsatisfaction of bewailing his instability:\r\n\r\n    “That statement of time and place was entirely correct.  I was\r\n    actually on the specified day in the specified church, which was,\r\n    moreover, a Jesuit church, namely, St. Sulpice; and I then went\r\n    through a religious act.  But this act was no odious abjuration, but\r\n    a very innocent conjugation; that is to say, my marriage, already\r\n    performed, according to the civil law there received the\r\n    ecclesiastical consecration, because my wife, whose family are\r\n    staunch Catholics, would not have thought her marriage sacred enough\r\n    without such a ceremony.  And I would on no account cause this\r\n    beloved being any uneasiness or disturbance in her religious views.”\r\n\r\nFor sixteen years—from 1831 to 1847—Heine lived that rapid concentrated\r\nlife which is known only in Paris; but then, alas! stole on the “days of\r\ndarkness,” and they were to be many.  In 1847 he felt the approach of the\r\nterrible spinal disease which has for seven years chained him to his bed\r\nin acute suffering.  The last time he went out of doors, he tells us, was\r\nin May, 1848:\r\n\r\n    “With difficulty I dragged myself to the Louvre, and I almost sank\r\n    down as I entered the magnificent hall where the ever-blessed goddess\r\n    of beauty, our beloved Lady of Milo, stands on her pedestal.  At her\r\n    feet I lay long, and wept so bitterly that a stone must have pitied\r\n    me.  The goddess looked compassionately on me, but at the same time\r\n    disconsolately, as if she would say, Dost thou not see, then, that I\r\n    have no arms, and thus cannot help thee?”\r\n\r\nSince 1848, then, this poet, whom the lovely objects of Nature have\r\nalways “haunted like a passion,” has not descended from the second story\r\nof a Parisian house; this man of hungry intellect has been shut out from\r\nall direct observation of life, all contact with society, except such as\r\nis derived from visitors to his sick-room.  The terrible nervous disease\r\nhas affected his eyes; the sight of one is utterly gone, and he can only\r\nraise the lid of the other by lifting it with his finger.  Opium alone is\r\nthe beneficent genius that stills his pain.  We hardly know whether to\r\ncall it an alleviation or an intensification of the torture that Heine\r\nretains his mental vigor, his poetic imagination, and his incisive wit;\r\nfor if this intellectual activity fills up a blank, it widens the sphere\r\nof suffering.  His brother described him in 1851 as still, in moments\r\nwhen the hand of pain was not too heavy on him, the same Heinrich Heine,\r\npoet and satirist by turns.  In such moments he would narrate the\r\nstrangest things in the gravest manner.  But when he came to an end, he\r\nwould roguishly lift up the lid of his right eye with his finger to see\r\nthe impression he had produced; and if his audience had been listening\r\nwith a serious face, he would break into Homeric laughter.  We have other\r\nproof than personal testimony that Heine’s disease allows his genius to\r\nretain much of its energy, in the “Romanzero,” a volume of poems\r\npublished in 1851, and written chiefly during the three first years of\r\nhis illness; and in the first volume of the “Vermischte Schriften,” also\r\nthe product of recent years.  Very plaintive is the poet’s own\r\ndescription of his condition, in the epilogue to the “Romanzero:”\r\n\r\n    “Do I really exist?  My body is so shrunken that I am hardly anything\r\n    but a voice; and my bed reminds me of the singing grave of the\r\n    magician Merlin, which lies in the forest of Brozeliand, in Brittany,\r\n    under tall oaks whose tops soar like green flames toward heaven.\r\n    Alas!  I envy thee those trees and the fresh breeze that moves their\r\n    branches, brother Merlin, for no green leaf rustles about my\r\n    mattress-grave in Paris, where early and late I hear nothing but the\r\n    rolling of vehicles, hammering, quarrelling, and piano-strumming.  A\r\n    grave without repose, death without the privileges of the dead, who\r\n    have no debts to pay, and need write neither letters nor books—that\r\n    is a piteous condition.  Long ago the measure has been taken for my\r\n    coffin and for my necrology, but I die so slowly that the process is\r\n    tedious for me as well as my friends.  But patience: everything has\r\n    an end.  You will one day find the booth closed where the puppet-show\r\n    of my humor has so often delighted you.”\r\n\r\nAs early as 1850 it was rumored that since Heine’s illness a change had\r\ntaken place in his religious views; and as rumor seldom stops short of\r\nextremes, it was soon said that he had become a thorough pietist,\r\nCatholics and Protestants by turns claiming him as a convert.  Such a\r\nchange in so uncompromising an iconoclast, in a man who had been so\r\nzealous in his negations as Heine, naturally excited considerable\r\nsensation in the camp he was supposed to have quitted, as well as in that\r\nhe was supposed to have joined.  In the second volume of the “Salon,” and\r\nin the “Romantische Schule,” written in 1834 and ’35, the doctrine of\r\nPantheism is dwelt on with a fervor and unmixed seriousness which show\r\nthat Pantheism was then an animating faith to Heine, and he attacks what\r\nhe considers the false spiritualism and asceticism of Christianity as the\r\nenemy of true beauty in Art, and of social well-being.  Now, however, it\r\nwas said that Heine had recanted all his heresies; but from the fact that\r\nvisitors to his sick-room brought away very various impressions as to his\r\nactual religious views, it seemed probable that his love of mystification\r\nhad found a tempting opportunity for exercise on this subject, and that,\r\nas one of his friends said, he was not inclined to pour out unmixed wine\r\nto those who asked for a sample out of mere curiosity.  At length, in the\r\nepilogue to the “Romanzero,” dated 1851, there appeared, amid much\r\nmystifying banter, a declaration that he had embraced Theism and the\r\nbelief in a future life, and what chiefly lent an air of seriousness and\r\nreliability to this affirmation was the fact that he took care to\r\naccompany it with certain negations:\r\n\r\n    “As concerns myself, I can boast of no particular progress in\r\n    politics; I adhered (after 1848) to the same democratic principles\r\n    which had the homage of my youth, and for which I have ever since\r\n    glowed with increasing fervor.  In theology, on the contrary, I must\r\n    accuse myself of retrogression, since, as I have already confessed, I\r\n    returned to the old superstition—to a personal God.  This fact is,\r\n    once for all, not to be stifled, as many enlightened and well-meaning\r\n    friends would fain have had it.  But I must expressly contradict the\r\n    report that my retrograde movement has carried me as far as to the\r\n    threshold of a Church, and that I have even been received into her\r\n    lap.  No: my religious convictions and views have remained free from\r\n    any tincture of ecclesiasticism; no chiming of bells has allured me,\r\n    no altar candles have dazzled me.  I have dallied with no dogmas, and\r\n    have not utterly renounced my reason.”\r\n\r\nThis sounds like a serious statement.  But what shall we say to a convert\r\nwho plays with his newly-acquired belief in a future life, as Heine does\r\nin the very next page?  He says to his reader:\r\n\r\n    “Console thyself; we shall meet again in a better world, where I also\r\n    mean to write thee better books.  I take for granted that my health\r\n    will there be improved, and that Swedenborg has not deceived me.  He\r\n    relates, namely, with great confidence, that we shall peacefully\r\n    carry on our old occupations in the other world, just as we have done\r\n    in this; that we shall there preserve our individuality unaltered,\r\n    and that death will produce no particular change in our organic\r\n    development.  Swedenborg is a thoroughly honorable fellow, and quite\r\n    worthy of credit in what he tells us about the other world, where he\r\n    saw with his own eyes the persons who had played a great part on our\r\n    earth.  Most of them, he says, remained unchanged, and busied\r\n    themselves with the same things as formerly; they remained\r\n    stationary, were old-fashioned, _rococo_—which now and then produced\r\n    a ludicrous effect.  For example, our dear Dr. Martin Luther kept\r\n    fast by his doctrine of Grace, about which he had for three hundred\r\n    years daily written down the same mouldy arguments—just in the same\r\n    way as the late Baron Ekstein, who during twenty years printed in the\r\n    _Allgemeine Zeitung_ one and the same article, perpetually chewing\r\n    over again the old cud of Jesuitical doctrine.  But, as we have said,\r\n    all persons who once figured here below were not found by Swedenborg\r\n    in such a state of fossil immutability: many had considerably\r\n    developed their character, both for good and evil, in the other\r\n    world; and this gave rise to some singular results.  Some who had\r\n    been heroes and saints on earth had _there_ sunk into scamps and\r\n    good-for-nothings; and there were examples, too, of a contrary\r\n    transformation.  For instance, the fumes of self-conceit mounted to\r\n    Saint Anthony’s head when he learned what immense veneration and\r\n    adoration had been paid to him by all Christendom; and he who here\r\n    below withstood the most terrible temptations was now quite an\r\n    impertinent rascal and dissolute gallows-bird, who vied with his pig\r\n    in rolling himself in the mud.  The chaste Susanna, from having been\r\n    excessively vain of her virtue, which she thought indomitable, came\r\n    to a shameful fall, and she who once so gloriously resisted the two\r\n    old men, was a victim to the seductions of the young Absalom, the son\r\n    of David.  On the contrary, Lot’s daughters had in the lapse of time\r\n    become very virtuous, and passed in the other world for models of\r\n    propriety: the old man, alas! had stuck to the wine-flask.”\r\n\r\nIn his “Geständnisse,” the retractation of former opinions and profession\r\nof Theism are renewed, but in a strain of irony that repels our sympathy\r\nand baffles our psychology.  Yet what strange, deep pathos is mingled\r\nwith the audacity of the following passage!\r\n\r\n    “What avails it me, that enthusiastic youths and maidens crown my\r\n    marble bust with laurel, when the withered hands of an aged nurse are\r\n    pressing Spanish flies behind my ears?  What avails it me, that all\r\n    the roses of Shiraz glow and waft incense for me?  Alas!  Shiraz is\r\n    two thousand miles from the Rue d’Amsterdam, where, in the wearisome\r\n    loneliness of my sick-room, I get no scent, except it be, perhaps,\r\n    the perfume of warmed towels.  Alas!  God’s satire weighs heavily on\r\n    me.  The great Author of the universe, the Aristophanes of Heaven,\r\n    was bent on demonstrating, with crushing force, to me, the little,\r\n    earthly, German Aristophanes, how my wittiest sarcasms are only\r\n    pitiful attempts at jesting in comparison with His, and how miserably\r\n    I am beneath him in humor, in colossal mockery.”\r\n\r\nFor our own part, we regard the paradoxical irreverence with which Heine\r\nprofesses his theoretical reverence as pathological, as the diseased\r\nexhibition of a predominant tendency urged into anomalous action by the\r\npressure of pain and mental privation—as a delirium of wit starved of its\r\nproper nourishment.  It is not for us to condemn, who have never had the\r\nsame burden laid on us; it is not for pigmies at their ease to criticise\r\nthe writhings of the Titan chained to the rock.\r\n\r\nOn one other point we must touch before quitting Heine’s personal\r\nhistory.  There is a standing accusation against him in some quarters of\r\nwanting political principle, of wishing to denationalize himself, and of\r\nindulging in insults against his native country.  Whatever ground may\r\nexist for these accusations, that ground is not, so far as we see, to be\r\nfound in his writings.  He may not have much faith in German revolutions\r\nand revolutionists; experience, in his case as in that of others, may\r\nhave thrown his millennial anticipations into more distant perspective;\r\nbut we see no evidence that he has ever swerved from his attachment to\r\nthe principles of freedom, or written anything which to a philosophic\r\nmind is incompatible with true patriotism.  He has expressly denied the\r\nreport that he wished to become naturalized in France; and his yearning\r\ntoward his native land and the accents of his native language is\r\nexpressed with a pathos the more reliable from the fact that he is\r\nsparing in such effusions.  We do not see why Heine’s satire of the\r\nblunders and foibles of his fellow-countrymen should be denounced as a\r\ncrime of _lèse-patrie_, any more than the political caricatures of any\r\nother satirist.  The real offences of Heine are his occasional coarseness\r\nand his unscrupulous personalities, which are reprehensible, not because\r\nthey are directed against his fellow-countrymen, but because they are\r\n_personalities_.  That these offences have their precedents in men whose\r\nmemory the world delights to honor does not remove their turpitude, but\r\nit is a fact which should modify our condemnation in a particular case;\r\nunless, indeed, we are to deliver our judgments on a principle of\r\ncompensation—making up for our indulgence in one direction by our\r\nseverity in another.  On this ground of coarseness and personality, a\r\ntrue bill may be found against Heine; _not_, we think, on the ground that\r\nhe has laughed at what is laughable in his compatriots.  Here is a\r\nspecimen of the satire under which we suppose German patriots wince:\r\n\r\n    “Rhenish Bavaria was to be the starting-point of the German\r\n    revolution.  Zweibrücken was the Bethlehem in which the infant\r\n    Saviour—Freedom—lay in the cradle, and gave whimpering promise of\r\n    redeeming the world.  Near his cradle bellowed many an ox, who\r\n    afterward, when his horns were reckoned on, showed himself a very\r\n    harmless brute.  It was confidently believed that the German\r\n    revolution would begin in Zweibrücken, and everything was there ripe\r\n    for an outbreak.  But, as has been hinted, the tender-heartedness of\r\n    some persons frustrated that illegal undertaking.  For example, among\r\n    the Bipontine conspirators there was a tremendous braggart, who was\r\n    always loudest in his rage, who boiled over with the hatred of\r\n    tyranny, and this man was fixed on to strike the first blow, by\r\n    cutting down a sentinel who kept an important post. . . . . ‘What!’\r\n    cried the man, when this order was given him—‘What!—me!  Can you\r\n    expect so horrible, so bloodthirsty an act of me?  I—_I_, kill an\r\n    innocent sentinel?  I, who am the father of a family!  And this\r\n    sentinel is perhaps also father of a family.  One father of a family\r\n    kill another father of a family?  Yes.  Kill—murder!’”\r\n\r\nIn political matters Heine, like all men whose intellect and taste\r\npredominate too far over their impulses to allow of their becoming\r\npartisans, is offensive alike to the aristocrat and the democrat.  By the\r\none he is denounced as a man who holds incendiary principles, by the\r\nother as a half-hearted “trimmer.”  He has no sympathy, as he says, with\r\n“that vague, barren pathos, that useless effervescence of enthusiasm,\r\nwhich plunges, with the spirit of a martyr, into an ocean of\r\ngeneralities, and which always reminds me of the American sailor, who had\r\nso fervent an enthusiasm for General Jackson, that he at last sprang from\r\nthe top of a mast into the sea, crying, “_I die for General Jackson_!”\r\n\r\n    “But thou liest, Brutus, thou liest, Cassius, and thou, too, liest,\r\n    Asinius, in maintaining that my ridicule attacks those ideas which\r\n    are the precious acquisition of Humanity, and for which I myself have\r\n    so striven and suffered.  No! for the very reason that those ideas\r\n    constantly hover before the poet in glorious splendor and majesty, he\r\n    is the more irresistibly overcome by laughter when he sees how\r\n    rudely, awkwardly, and clumsily those ideas are seized and mirrored\r\n    in the contracted minds of contemporaries. . . . There are mirrors\r\n    which have so rough a surface that even an Apollo reflected in them\r\n    becomes a caricature, and excites our laughter.  _But we laugh then\r\n    only at the caricature_, _not at the god_.”\r\n\r\nFor the rest, why should we demand of Heine that he should be a hero, a\r\npatriot, a solemn prophet, any more than we should demand of a gazelle\r\nthat it should draw well in harness?  Nature has not made him of her\r\nsterner stuff—not of iron and adamant, but of pollen of flowers, the\r\njuice of the grape, and Puck’s mischievous brain, plenteously mixing also\r\nthe dews of kindly affection and the gold-dust of noble thoughts.  It is,\r\nafter all, a _tribute_ which his enemies pay him when they utter their\r\nbitterest dictum, namely, that he is “_nur Dichter_”—only a poet.  Let us\r\naccept this point of view for the present, and, leaving all consideration\r\nof him as a man, look at him simply as a poet and literary artist.\r\n\r\nHeine is essentially a lyric poet.  The finest products of his genius are\r\n\r\n    “Short swallow flights of song that dip\r\n    Their wings in tears, and skim away;”\r\n\r\nand they are so emphatically songs that, in reading them, we feel as if\r\neach must have a twin melody born in the same moment and by the same\r\ninspiration.  Heine is too impressible and mercurial for any sustained\r\nproduction; even in his short lyrics his tears sometimes pass into\r\nlaughter and his laughter into tears; and his longer poems, “Atta Troll”\r\nand “Deutschland,” are full of Ariosto-like transitions.  His song has a\r\nwide compass of notes; he can take us to the shores of the Northern Sea\r\nand thrill us by the sombre sublimity of his pictures and dreamy fancies;\r\nhe can draw forth our tears by the voice he gives to our own sorrows, or\r\nto the sorrows of “Poor Peter;” he can throw a cold shudder over us by a\r\nmysterious legend, a ghost story, or a still more ghastly rendering of\r\nhard reality; he can charm us by a quiet idyl, shake us with laughter at\r\nhis overflowing fun, or give us a piquant sensation of surprise by the\r\ningenuity of his transitions from the lofty to the ludicrous.  This last\r\npower is not, indeed, essentially poetical; but only a poet can use it\r\nwith the same success as Heine, for only a poet can poise our emotion and\r\nexpectation at such a height as to give effect to the sudden fall.\r\nHeine’s greatest power as a poet lies in his simple pathos, in the\r\never-varied but always natural expression he has given to the tender\r\nemotions.  We may perhaps indicate this phase of his genius by referring\r\nto Wordsworth’s beautiful little poem, “She dwelt among the untrodden\r\nways;” the conclusion—\r\n\r\n    “She dwelt alone, and few could know\r\n       When Lucy ceased to be;\r\n    But she is in her grave, and, oh!\r\n       The difference to me”—\r\n\r\nis entirely in Heine’s manner; and so is Tennyson’s poem of a dozen\r\nlines, called “Circumstance.”  Both these poems have Heine’s pregnant\r\nsimplicity.  But, lest this comparison should mislead, we must say that\r\nthere is no general resemblance between either Wordsworth, or Tennyson,\r\nand Heine.  Their greatest qualities lie quite a way from the light,\r\ndelicate lucidity, the easy, rippling music, of Heine’s style.  The\r\ndistinctive charm of his lyrics may best be seen by comparing them with\r\nGoethe’s.  Both have the same masterly, finished simplicity and rhythmic\r\ngrace; but there is more thought mingled with Goethe’s feeling—his\r\nlyrical genius is a vessel that draws more water than Heine’s, and,\r\nthough it seems to glide along with equal ease, we have a sense of\r\ngreater weight and force, accompanying the grace of its movements.\r\n\r\nBut for this very reason Heine touches our hearts more strongly; his\r\nsongs are all music and feeling—they are like birds that not only enchant\r\nus with their delicious notes, but nestle against us with their soft\r\nbreasts, and make us feel the agitated beating of their hearts.  He\r\nindicates a whole sad history in a single quatrain; there is not an image\r\nin it, not a thought; but it is beautiful, simple, and perfect as a “big\r\nround tear”—it is pure feeling, breathed in pure music:\r\n\r\n    “Anfangs wollt’ ich fast verzagen\r\n    Und ich glaubt’ ich trug es nie,\r\n    Und ich hab’ es doch getragen—\r\n    Aber fragt mich nur nicht, wie.” {134}\r\n\r\nHe excels equally in the more imaginative expression of feeling: he\r\nrepresents it by a brief image, like a finely cut cameo; he expands it\r\ninto a mysterious dream, or dramatizes it in a little story, half ballad,\r\nhalf idyl; and in all these forms his art is so perfect that we never\r\nhave a sense of artificiality or of unsuccessful effort; but all seems to\r\nhave developed itself by the same beautiful necessity that brings forth\r\nvine-leaves and grapes and the natural curls of childhood.  Of Heine’s\r\nhumorous poetry, “Deutschland” is the most charming specimen—charming,\r\nespecially, because its wit and humor grow out of a rich loam of thought.\r\n“Atta Troll” is more original, more various, more fantastic; but it is\r\ntoo great a strain on the imagination to be a general favorite.  We have\r\nsaid that feeling is the element in which Heine’s poetic genius\r\nhabitually floats; but he can occasionally soar to a higher region, and\r\nimpart deep significance to picturesque symbolism; he can flash a sublime\r\nthought over the past and into the future; he can pour forth a lofty\r\nstrain of hope or indignation.  Few could forget, after once hearing\r\nthem, the stanzas at the close of “Deutschland,” in which he warns the\r\nKing of Prussia not to incur the irredeemable hell which the injured poet\r\ncan create for him—the _singing flames_ of a Dante’s _terza rima_!\r\n\r\n    “Kennst du die Hölle des Dante nicht,\r\n    Die schrecklichen Terzetten?\r\n    Wen da der Dichter hineingesperrt\r\n    Den kann kein Gott mehr retten.\r\n\r\n    “Kein Gott, kein Heiland, erlöst ihn je\r\n    Aus diesen singenden Flammen!\r\n    Nimm dich in Acht, das wir dich nicht\r\n    Zu solcher Hölle verdammen.”  {135}\r\n\r\nAs a prosaist, Heine is, in one point of view, even more distinguished\r\nthan as a poet.  The German language easily lends itself to all the\r\npurposes of poetry; like the ladies of the Middle Ages, it is gracious\r\nand compliant to the Troubadours.  But as these same ladies were often\r\ncrusty and repulsive to their unmusical mates, so the German language\r\ngenerally appears awkward and unmanageable in the hands of prose writers.\r\nIndeed, the number of really fine German prosaists before Heine would\r\nhardly have exceeded the numerating powers of a New Hollander, who can\r\ncount three and no more.  Persons the most familiar with German prose\r\ntestify that there is an extra fatigue in reading it, just as we feel an\r\nextra fatigue from our walk when it takes us over ploughed clay.  But in\r\nHeine’s hands German prose, usually so heavy, so clumsy, so dull,\r\nbecomes, like clay in the hands of the chemist, compact, metallic,\r\nbrilliant; it is German in an _allotropic_ condition.  No dreary\r\nlabyrinthine sentences in which you find “no end in wandering mazes\r\nlost;” no chains of adjectives in linked harshness long drawn out; no\r\ndigressions thrown in as parentheses; but crystalline definiteness and\r\nclearness, fine and varied rhythm, and all that delicate precision, all\r\nthose felicities of word and cadence, which belong to the highest order\r\nof prose.  And Heine has proved—what Madame de Stäel seems to have\r\ndoubted—that it is possible to be witty in German; indeed, in reading\r\nhim, you might imagine that German was pre-eminently the language of wit,\r\nso flexible, so subtle, so piquant does it become under his management.\r\nHe is far more an artist in prose than Goethe.  He has not the breadth\r\nand repose, and the calm development which belong to Goethe’s style, for\r\nthey are foreign to his mental character; but he excels Goethe in\r\nsusceptibility to the manifold qualities of prose, and in mastery over\r\nits effects.  Heine is full of variety, of light and shadow: he\r\nalternates between epigrammatic pith, imaginative grace, sly allusion,\r\nand daring piquancy; and athwart all these there runs a vein of sadness,\r\ntenderness, and grandeur which reveals the poet.  He continually throws\r\nout those finely chiselled sayings which stamp themselves on the memory,\r\nand become familiar by quotation.  For example: “The People have time\r\nenough, they are immortal; kings only are mortal.”—“Wherever a great soul\r\nutters its thoughts, there is Golgotha.”—“Nature wanted to see how she\r\nlooked, and she created Goethe.”—“Only the man who has known bodily\r\nsuffering is truly a _man_; his limbs have their Passion history, they\r\nare spiritualized.”  He calls Rubens “this Flemish Titan, the wings of\r\nwhose genius were so strong that he soared as high as the sun, in spite\r\nof the hundred-weight of Dutch cheeses that hung on his legs.”  Speaking\r\nof Börne’s dislike to the calm creations of the true artist, he says, “He\r\nwas like a child which, insensible to the glowing significance of a Greek\r\nstatue, only touches the marble and complains of cold.”\r\n\r\nThe most poetic and specifically humorous of Heine’s prose writings are\r\nthe “Reisebilder.”  The comparison with Sterne is inevitable here; but\r\nHeine does not suffer from it, for if he falls below Sterne in raciness\r\nof humor, he is far above him in poetic sensibility and in reach and\r\nvariety of thought.  Heine’s humor is never persistent, it never flows on\r\nlong in easy gayety and drollery; where it is not swelled by the tide of\r\npoetic feeling, it is continually dashing down the precipice of a\r\nwitticism.  It is not broad and unctuous; it is aërial and sprite-like, a\r\nmomentary resting-place between his poetry and his wit.  In the\r\n“Reisebilder” he runs through the whole gamut of his powers, and gives us\r\nevery hue of thought, from the wildly droll and fantastic to the sombre\r\nand the terrible.  Here is a passage almost Dantesque in conception:\r\n\r\n    “Alas! one ought in truth to write against no one in this world.\r\n    Each of us is sick enough in this great lazaretto, and many a\r\n    polemical writing reminds me involuntarily of a revolting quarrel, in\r\n    a little hospital at Cracow, of which I chanced to be a witness, and\r\n    where it was horrible to hear how the patients mockingly reproached\r\n    each other with their infirmities: how one who was wasted by\r\n    consumption jeered at another who was bloated by dropsy; how one\r\n    laughed at another’s cancer in the nose, and this one again at his\r\n    neighbor’s locked-jaw or squint, until at last the delirious\r\n    fever-patient sprang out of bed and tore away the coverings from the\r\n    wounded bodies of his companions, and nothing was to be seen but\r\n    hideous misery and mutilation.”\r\n\r\nAnd how fine is the transition in the very next chapter, where, after\r\nquoting the Homeric description of the feasting gods, he says:\r\n\r\n    “Then suddenly approached, panting, a pale Jew, with drops of blood\r\n    on his brow, with a crown of thorns on his head, and a great cross\r\n    laid on his shoulders; and he threw the cross on the high table of\r\n    the gods, so that the golden cups tottered, and the gods became dumb\r\n    and pale, and grew ever paler, till they at last melted away into\r\n    vapor.”\r\n\r\nThe richest specimens of Heine’s wit are perhaps to be found in the works\r\nwhich have appeared since the “Reisebilder.”  The years, if they have\r\nintensified his satirical bitterness, have also given his wit a finer\r\nedge and polish.  His sarcasms are so subtly prepared and so slily\r\nallusive, that they may often escape readers whose sense of wit is not\r\nvery acute; but for those who delight in the subtle and delicate flavors\r\nof style, there can hardly be any wit more irresistible than Heine’s.  We\r\nmay measure its force by the degree in which it has subdued the German\r\nlanguage to its purposes, and made that language brilliant in spite of a\r\nlong hereditary transmission of dulness.  As one of the most harmless\r\nexamples of his satire, take this on a man who has certainly had his\r\nshare of adulation:\r\n\r\n    “Assuredly it is far from my purpose to depreciate M. Victor Cousin.\r\n    The titles of this celebrated philosopher even lay me under an\r\n    obligation to praise him.  He belongs to that living pantheon of\r\n    France which we call the peerage, and his intelligent legs rest on\r\n    the velvet benches of the Luxembourg.  I must indeed sternly repress\r\n    all private feelings which might seduce me into an excessive\r\n    enthusiasm.  Otherwise I might be suspected of servility; for M.\r\n    Cousin is very influential in the State by means of his position and\r\n    his tongue.  This consideration might even move me to speak of his\r\n    faults as frankly as of his virtues.  Will he himself disapprove of\r\n    this?  Assuredly not.  I know that we cannot do higher honor to great\r\n    minds than when we throw as strong a light on their demerits as on\r\n    their merits.  When we sing the praises of a Hercules, we must also\r\n    mention that he once laid aside the lion’s skin and sat down to the\r\n    distaff: what then? he remains notwithstanding a Hercules!  So when\r\n    we relate similar circumstances concerning M. Cousin, we must\r\n    nevertheless add, with discriminating eulogy: _M. Cousin_, _if he has\r\n    sometimes sat twaddling at the distaff_, _has never laid aside the\r\n    lion’s skin_. . . . It is true that, having been suspected of\r\n    demagogy, he spent some time in a German prison, just as Lafayette\r\n    and Richard Cœur de Lion.  But that M. Cousin there in his leisure\r\n    hours studied Kant’s ‘Critique of Pure Reason’ is to be doubted on\r\n    three grounds.  First, this book is written in German.  Secondly, in\r\n    order to read this book, a man must understand German.  Thirdly, M.\r\n    Cousin does not understand German. . . . I fear I am passing unawares\r\n    from the sweet waters of praise into the bitter ocean of blame.  Yes,\r\n    on one account I cannot refrain from bitterly blaming M.\r\n    Cousin—namely, that he who loves truth far more than he loves Plato\r\n    and Tenneman is unjust to himself when he wants to persuade us that\r\n    he has borrowed something from the philosophy of Schelling and Hegel.\r\n    Against this self-accusation I must take M. Cousin under my\r\n    protection.  On my word and conscience! this honorable man has not\r\n    stolen a jot from Schelling and Hegel, and if he brought home\r\n    anything of theirs, it was merely their friendship.  That does honor\r\n    to his heart.  But there are many instances of such false\r\n    self-accusation in psychology.  I knew a man who declared that he had\r\n    stolen silver spoons at the king’s table; and yet we all knew that\r\n    the poor devil had never been presented at court, and accused himself\r\n    of stealing these spoons to make us believe that he had been a guest\r\n    at the palace.  No!  In German philosophy M. Cousin has always kept\r\n    the sixth commandment; here he has never pocketed a single idea, not\r\n    so much as a salt-spoon of an idea.  All witnesses agree in attesting\r\n    that in this respect M. Cousin is honor itself. . . .  I prophesy to\r\n    you that the renown of M. Cousin, like the French Revolution, will go\r\n    round the world!  I hear some one wickedly add: Undeniably the renown\r\n    of M. Cousin is going round the world, and _it has already taken its\r\n    departure from France_.”\r\n\r\nThe following “symbolical myth” about Louis Philippe is very\r\ncharacteristic of Heine’s manner:\r\n\r\n    “I remember very well that immediately on my arrival (in Paris) I\r\n    hastened to the Palais Royal to see Louis Philippe.  The friend who\r\n    conducted me told me that the king now appeared on the terrace only\r\n    at stated hours, but that formerly he was to be seen at any time for\r\n    five francs.  ‘For five francs!’ I cried with amazement; ‘does he\r\n    then show himself for money?’  ‘No, but he is shown for money, and it\r\n    happens in this way: There is a society of _claqueurs_, _marchands de\r\n    contremarques_, and such riff-raff, who offered every foreigner to\r\n    show him the king for five francs: if he would give ten francs, he\r\n    might see the king raise his eyes to heaven, and lay his hand\r\n    protestingly on his heart; if he would give twenty francs, the king\r\n    would sing the Marseillaise.  If the foreigner gave five francs, they\r\n    raised a loud cheering under the king’s windows, and His Majesty\r\n    appeared on the terrace, bowed, and retired.  If ten francs, they\r\n    shouted still louder, and gesticulated as if they had been possessed,\r\n    when the king appeared, who then, as a sign of silent emotion, raised\r\n    his eyes to heaven and laid his hand on his heart.  English visitors,\r\n    however, would sometimes spend as much as twenty francs, and then the\r\n    enthusiasm mounted to the highest pitch; no sooner did the king\r\n    appear on the terrace than the Marseillaise was struck up and roared\r\n    out frightfully, until Louis Philippe, perhaps only for the sake of\r\n    putting an end to the singing, bowed, laid his hand on his heart, and\r\n    joined in the Marseillaise.  Whether, as is asserted, he beat time\r\n    with his foot, I cannot say.’”\r\n\r\nOne more quotation, and it must be our last:\r\n\r\n    “Oh the women!  We must forgive them much, for they love much—and\r\n    many.  Their hate is properly only love turned inside out.  Sometimes\r\n    they attribute some delinquency to us, because they think they can in\r\n    this way gratify another man.  When they write, they have always one\r\n    eye on the paper and the other on a man; and this is true of all\r\n    authoresses, except the Countess Hahn-Hahn, who has only one eye.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nV.  THE NATURAL HISTORY OF GERMAN LIFE. {141}\r\n\r\n\r\nIt is an interesting branch of psychological observation to note the\r\nimages that are habitually associated with abstract or collective\r\nterms—what may be called the picture-writing of the mind, which it\r\ncarries on concurrently with the more subtle symbolism of language.\r\nPerhaps the fixity or variety of these associated images would furnish a\r\ntolerably fair test of the amount of concrete knowledge and experience\r\nwhich a given word represents, in the minds of two persons who use it\r\nwith equal familiarity.  The word _railways_, for example, will probably\r\ncall up, in the mind of a man who is not highly locomotive, the image\r\neither of a “Bradshaw,” or of the station with which he is most familiar,\r\nor of an indefinite length of tram-road; he will alternate between these\r\nthree images, which represent his stock of concrete acquaintance with\r\nrailways.  But suppose a man to have had successively the experience of a\r\n“navvy,” an engineer, a traveller, a railway director and shareholder,\r\nand a landed proprietor in treaty with a railway company, and it is\r\nprobable that the range of images which would by turns present themselves\r\nto his mind at the mention of the _word_ “railways,” would include all\r\nthe essential facts in the existence and relations of the _thing_.  Now\r\nit is possible for the first-mentioned personage to entertain very\r\nexpanded views as to the multiplication of railways in the abstract, and\r\ntheir ultimate function in civilization.  He may talk of a vast network\r\nof railways stretching over the globe, of future “lines” in Madagascar,\r\nand elegant refreshment-rooms in the Sandwich Islands, with none the less\r\nglibness because his distinct conceptions on the subject do not extend\r\nbeyond his one station and his indefinite length of tram-road.  But it is\r\nevident that if we want a railway to be made, or its affairs to be\r\nmanaged, this man of wide views and narrow observation will not serve our\r\npurpose.\r\n\r\nProbably, if we could ascertain the images called up by the terms “the\r\npeople,” “the masses,” “the proletariat,” “the peasantry,” by many who\r\ntheorize on those bodies with eloquence, or who legislate without\r\neloquence, we should find that they indicate almost as small an amount of\r\nconcrete knowledge—that they are as far from completely representing the\r\ncomplex facts summed up in the collective term, as the railway images of\r\nour non-locomotive gentleman.  How little the real characteristics of the\r\nworking-classes are known to those who are outside them, how little their\r\nnatural history has been studied, is sufficiently disclosed by our Art as\r\nwell as by our political and social theories.  Where, in our picture\r\nexhibitions, shall we find a group of true peasantry?  What English\r\nartist even attempts to rival in truthfulness such studies of popular\r\nlife as the pictures of Teniers or the ragged boys of Murillo?  Even one\r\nof the greatest painters of the pre-eminently realistic school, while, in\r\nhis picture of “The Hireling Shepherd,” he gave us a landscape of\r\nmarvellous truthfulness, placed a pair of peasants in the foreground who\r\nwere not much more real than the idyllic swains and damsels of our\r\nchimney ornaments.  Only a total absence of acquaintance and sympathy\r\nwith our peasantry could give a moment’s popularity to such a picture as\r\n“Cross Purposes,” where we have a peasant girl who looks as if she knew\r\nL. E. L.’s poems by heart, and English rustics, whose costume seems to\r\nindicate that they are meant for ploughmen, with exotic features that\r\nremind us of a handsome _primo tenore_.  Rather than such cockney\r\nsentimentality as this, as an education for the taste and sympathies, we\r\nprefer the most crapulous group of boors that Teniers ever painted.  But\r\neven those among our painters who aim at giving the rustic type of\r\nfeatures, who are far above the effeminate feebleness of the “Keepsake”\r\nstyle, treat their subjects under the influence of traditions and\r\nprepossessions rather than of direct observation.  The notion that\r\npeasants are joyous, that the typical moment to represent a man in a\r\nsmock-frock is when he is cracking a joke and showing a row of sound\r\nteeth, that cottage matrons are usually buxom, and village children\r\nnecessarily rosy and merry, are prejudices difficult to dislodge from the\r\nartistic mind, which looks for its subjects into literature instead of\r\nlife.  The painter is still under the influence of idyllic literature,\r\nwhich has always expressed the imagination of the cultivated and\r\ntown-bred, rather than the truth of rustic life.  Idyllic ploughmen are\r\njocund when they drive their team afield; idyllic shepherds make bashful\r\nlove under hawthorn bushes; idyllic villagers dance in the checkered\r\nshade and refresh themselves, not immoderately, with spicy nut-brown ale.\r\nBut no one who has seen much of actual ploughmen thinks them jocund; no\r\none who is well acquainted with the English peasantry can pronounce them\r\nmerry.  The slow gaze, in which no sense of beauty beams, no humor\r\ntwinkles, the slow utterance, and the heavy, slouching walk, remind one\r\nrather of that melancholy animal the camel than of the sturdy countryman,\r\nwith striped stockings, red waistcoat, and hat aside, who represents the\r\ntraditional English peasant.  Observe a company of haymakers.  When you\r\nsee them at a distance, tossing up the forkfuls of hay in the golden\r\nlight, while the wagon creeps slowly with its increasing burden over the\r\nmeadow, and the bright green space which tells of work done gets larger\r\nand larger, you pronounce the scene “smiling,” and you think these\r\ncompanions in labor must be as bright and cheerful as the picture to\r\nwhich they give animation.  Approach nearer, and you will certainly find\r\nthat haymaking time is a time for joking, especially if there are women\r\namong the laborers; but the coarse laugh that bursts out every now and\r\nthen, and expresses the triumphant taunt, is as far as possible from your\r\nconception of idyllic merriment.  That delicious effervescence of the\r\nmind which we call fun has no equivalent for the northern peasant, except\r\ntipsy revelry; the only realm of fancy and imagination for the English\r\nclown exists at the bottom of the third quart pot.\r\n\r\nThe conventional countryman of the stage, who picks up pocket-books and\r\nnever looks into them, and who is too simple even to know that honesty\r\nhas its opposite, represents the still lingering mistake, that an\r\nunintelligible dialect is a guarantee for ingenuousness, and that\r\nslouching shoulders indicate an upright disposition.  It is quite true\r\nthat a thresher is likely to be innocent of any adroit arithmetical\r\ncheating, but he is not the less likely to carry home his master’s corn\r\nin his shoes and pocket; a reaper is not given to writing\r\nbegging-letters, but he is quite capable of cajoling the dairymaid into\r\nfilling his small-beer bottle with ale.  The selfish instincts are not\r\nsubdued by the sight of buttercups, nor is integrity in the least\r\nestablished by that classic rural occupation, sheep-washing.  To make men\r\nmoral something more is requisite than to turn them out to grass.\r\n\r\nOpera peasants, whose unreality excites Mr. Ruskin’s indignation, are\r\nsurely too frank an idealization to be misleading; and since popular\r\nchorus is one of the most effective elements of the opera, we can hardly\r\nobject to lyric rustics in elegant laced boddices and picturesque motley,\r\nunless we are prepared to advocate a chorus of colliers in their pit\r\ncostume, or a ballet of charwomen and stocking-weavers.  But our social\r\nnovels profess to represent the people as they are, and the unreality of\r\ntheir representations is a grave evil.  The greatest benefit we owe to\r\nthe artist, whether painter, poet, or novelist, is the extension of our\r\nsympathies.  Appeals founded on generalizations and statistics require a\r\nsympathy ready-made, a moral sentiment already in activity; but a picture\r\nof human life such as a great artist can give, surprises even the trivial\r\nand the selfish into that attention to what is a part from themselves,\r\nwhich may be called the raw material of moral sentiment.  When Scott\r\ntakes us into Luckie Mucklebackit’s cottage, or tells the story of “The\r\nTwo Drovers;” when Wordsworth sings to us the reverie of “Poor Susan;”\r\nwhen Kingsley shows us Alton Locke gazing yearningly over the gate which\r\nleads from the highway into the first wood he ever saw; when Hornung\r\npaints a group of chimney-sweepers—more is done toward linking the higher\r\nclasses with the lower, toward obliterating the vulgarity of\r\nexclusiveness, than by hundreds of sermons and philosophical\r\ndissertations.  Art is the nearest thing to life; it is a mode of\r\namplifying experience and extending our contact with our fellow-men\r\nbeyond the bounds of our personal lot.  All the more sacred is the task\r\nof the artist when he undertakes to paint the life of the People.\r\nFalsification here is far more pernicious than in the more artificial\r\naspects of life.  It is not so very serious that we should have false\r\nideas about evanescent fashions—about the manners and conversation of\r\nbeaux and duchesses; but it _is_ serious that our sympathy with the\r\nperennial joys and struggles, the toil, the tragedy, and the humor in the\r\nlife of our more heavily laden fellow-men, should be perverted, and\r\nturned toward a false object instead of the true one.\r\n\r\nThis perversion is not the less fatal because the misrepresentation which\r\ngive rise to it has what the artist considers a moral end.  The thing for\r\nmankind to know is, not what are the motives and influences which the\r\nmoralist thinks _ought_ to act on the laborer or the artisan, but what\r\nare the motives and influences which _do_ act on him.  We want to be\r\ntaught to feel, not for the heroic artisan or the sentimental peasant,\r\nbut for the peasant in all his coarse apathy, and the artisan in all his\r\nsuspicious selfishness.\r\n\r\nWe have one great novelist who is gifted with the utmost power of\r\nrendering the external traits of our town population; and if he could\r\ngive us their psychological character—their conception of life, and their\r\nemotions—with the same truth as their idiom and manners, his books would\r\nbe the greatest contribution Art has ever made to the awakening of social\r\nsympathies.  But while he can copy Mrs. Plornish’s colloquial style with\r\nthe delicate accuracy of a sun-picture, while there is the same startling\r\ninspiration in his description of the gestures and phrases of “Boots,” as\r\nin the speeches of Shakespeare’s mobs or numskulls, he scarcely ever\r\npasses from the humorous and external to the emotional and tragic,\r\nwithout becoming as transcendent in his unreality as he was a moment\r\nbefore in his artistic truthfulness.  But for the precious salt of his\r\nhumor, which compels him to reproduce external traits that serve in some\r\ndegree as a corrective to his frequently false psychology, his\r\npreternaturally virtuous poor children and artisans, his melodramatic\r\nboatmen and courtesans, would be as obnoxious as Eugène Sue’s idealized\r\nproletaires, in encouraging the miserable fallacy that high morality and\r\nrefined sentiment can grow out of harsh social relations, ignorance, and\r\nwant; or that the working-classes are in a condition to enter at once\r\ninto a millennial state of _altruism_, wherein every one is caring for\r\neveryone else, and no one for himself.\r\n\r\nIf we need a true conception of the popular character to guide our\r\nsympathies rightly, we need it equally to check our theories, and direct\r\nus in their application.  The tendency created by the splendid conquests\r\nof modern generalization, to believe that all social questions are merged\r\nin economical science, and that the relations of men to their neighbors\r\nmay be settled by algebraic equations—the dream that the uncultured\r\nclasses are prepared for a condition which appeals principally to their\r\nmoral sensibilities—the aristocractic dilettantism which attempts to\r\nrestore the “good old times” by a sort of idyllic masquerading, and to\r\ngrow feudal fidelity and veneration as we grow prize turnips, by an\r\nartificial system of culture—none of these diverging mistakes can coexist\r\nwith a real knowledge of the people, with a thorough study of their\r\nhabits, their ideas, their motives.  The landholder, the clergyman, the\r\nmill-owner, the mining-agent, have each an opportunity for making\r\nprecious observations on different sections of the working-classes, but\r\nunfortunately their experience is too often not registered at all, or its\r\nresults are too scattered to be available as a source of information and\r\nstimulus to the public mind generally.  If any man of sufficient moral\r\nand intellectual breadth, whose observations would not be vitiated by a\r\nforegone conclusion, or by a professional point of view, would devote\r\nhimself to studying the natural history of our social classes, especially\r\nof the small shopkeepers, artisans, and peasantry—the degree in which\r\nthey are influenced by local conditions, their maxims and habits, the\r\npoints of view from which they regard their religious teachers, and the\r\ndegree in which they are influenced by religious doctrines, the\r\ninteraction of the various classes on each other, and what are the\r\ntendencies in their position toward disintegration or toward\r\ndevelopment—and if, after all this study, he would give us the result of\r\nhis observation in a book well nourished with specific facts, his work\r\nwould be a valuable aid to the social and political reformer.\r\n\r\nWhat we are desiring for ourselves has been in some degree done for the\r\nGermans by Riehl, the author of the very remarkable books, the titles of\r\nwhich are placed at the head of this article; and we wish to make these\r\nbooks known to our readers, not only for the sake of the interesting\r\nmatter they contain, and the important reflections they suggest, but also\r\nas a model for some future or actual student of our own people.  By way\r\nof introducing Riehl to those who are unacquainted with his writings, we\r\nwill give a rapid sketch from his picture of the German Peasantry, and\r\nperhaps this indication of the mode in which he treats a particular\r\nbranch of his subject may prepare them to follow us with more interest\r\nwhen we enter on the general purpose and contents of his works.\r\n\r\nIn England, at present, when we speak of the peasantry we mean scarcely\r\nmore than the class of farm-servants and farm-laborers; and it is only in\r\nthe most primitive districts, as in Wales, for example, that farmers are\r\nincluded under the term.  In order to appreciate what Riehl says of the\r\nGerman peasantry, we must remember what the tenant-farmers and small\r\nproprietors were in England half a century ago, when the master helped to\r\nmilk his own cows, and the daughters got up at one o’clock in the morning\r\nto brew—when the family dined in the kitchen with the servants, and sat\r\nwith them round the kitchen fire, in the evening.  In those days, the\r\nquarried parlor was innocent of a carpet, and its only specimens of art\r\nwere a framed sampler and the best tea-board; the daughters even of\r\nsubstantial farmers had often no greater accomplishment in writing and\r\nspelling than they could procure at a dame-school; and, instead of\r\ncarrying on sentimental correspondence, they were spinning their future\r\ntable-linen, and looking after every saving in butter and eggs that might\r\nenable them to add to the little stock of plate and china which they were\r\nlaying in against their marriage.  In our own day, setting aside the\r\nsuperior order of farmers, whose style of living and mental culture are\r\noften equal to that of the professional class in provincial towns, we can\r\nhardly enter the least imposing farm-house without finding a bad piano in\r\nthe “drawing-room,” and some old annuals, disposed with a symmetrical\r\nimitation of negligence, on the table; though the daughters may still\r\ndrop their _h’s_, their vowels are studiously narrow; and it is only in\r\nvery primitive regions that they will consent to sit in a covered vehicle\r\nwithout springs, which was once thought an advance in luxury on the\r\npillion.\r\n\r\nThe condition of the tenant-farmers and small proprietors in Germany is,\r\nwe imagine, about on a par, not, certainly, in material prosperity, but\r\nin mental culture and habits, with that of the English farmers who were\r\nbeginning to be thought old-fashioned nearly fifty years ago, and if we\r\nadd to these the farm servants and laborers we shall have a class\r\napproximating in its characteristics to the _Bauernthum_, or peasantry,\r\ndescribed by Riehl.\r\n\r\nIn Germany, perhaps more than in any other country, it is among the\r\npeasantry that we must look for the historical type of the national\r\n_physique_.  In the towns this type has become so modified to express the\r\npersonality of the individual that even “family likeness” is often but\r\nfaintly marked.  But the peasants may still be distinguished into groups,\r\nby their physical peculiarities.  In one part of the country we find a\r\nlonger-legged, in another a broader-shouldered race, which has inherited\r\nthese peculiarities for centuries.  For example, in certain districts of\r\nHesse are seen long faces, with high foreheads, long, straight noses, and\r\nsmall eyes, with arched eyebrows and large eyelids.  On comparing these\r\nphysiognomies with the sculptures in the church of St. Elizabeth, at\r\nMarburg, executed in the thirteenth century, it will be found that the\r\nsame old Hessian type of face has subsisted unchanged, with this\r\ndistinction only, that the sculptures represent princes and nobles, whose\r\nfeatures then bore the stamp of their race, while that stamp is now to be\r\nfound only among the peasants.  A painter who wants to draw mediæval\r\ncharacters with historic truth must seek his models among the peasantry.\r\nThis explains why the old German painters gave the heads of their\r\nsubjects a greater uniformity of type than the painters of our day; the\r\nrace had not attained to a high degree of individualization in features\r\nand expression.  It indicates, too, that the cultured man acts more as an\r\nindividual, the peasant more as one of a group.  Hans drives the plough,\r\nlives, and thinks, just as Kunz does; and it is this fact that many\r\nthousands of men are as like each other in thoughts and habits as so many\r\nsheep or oysters, which constitutes the weight of the peasantry in the\r\nsocial and political scale.\r\n\r\nIn the cultivated world each individual has his style of speaking and\r\nwriting.  But among the peasantry it is the race, the district, the\r\nprovince, that has its style—namely, its dialect, its phraseology, its\r\nproverbs, and its songs, which belong alike to the entire body of the\r\npeople.  This provincial style of the peasant is again, like his\r\n_physique_, a remnant of history, to which he clings with the utmost\r\ntenacity.  In certain parts of Hungary there are still descendants of\r\nGerman colonists of the twelfth and thirteenth centuries, who go about\r\nthe country as reapers, retaining their old Saxon songs and manners,\r\nwhile the more cultivated German emigrants in a very short time forget\r\ntheir own language, and speak Hungarian.  Another remarkable case of the\r\nsame kind is that of the Wends, a Slavonic race settled in Lusatia, whose\r\nnumbers amount to 200,000, living either scattered among the German\r\npopulation or in separate parishes.  They have their own schools and\r\nchurches, and are taught in the Slavonic tongue.  The Catholics among\r\nthem are rigid adherents of the Pope; the Protestants not less rigid\r\nadherents of Luther, or _Doctor_ Luther, as they are particular in\r\ncalling him—a custom which a hundred years ago was universal in\r\nProtestant Germany.  The Wend clings tenaciously to the usages of his\r\nChurch, and perhaps this may contribute not a little to the purity in\r\nwhich he maintains the specific characteristics of his race.  German\r\neducation, German law and government, service in the standing army, and\r\nmany other agencies, are in antagonism to his national exclusiveness; but\r\nthe _wives_ and _mothers_ here, as elsewhere, are a conservative\r\ninfluence, and the habits temporarily laid aside in the outer world are\r\nrecovered by the fireside.  The Wends form several stout regiments in the\r\nSaxon army; they are sought far and wide, as diligent and honest\r\nservants; and many a weakly Dresden or Leipzig child becomes thriving\r\nunder the care of a Wendish nurse.  In their villages they have the air\r\nand habits of genuine sturdy peasants, and all their customs indicate\r\nthat they have been from the first an agricultural people.  For example,\r\nthey have traditional modes of treating their domestic animals.  Each cow\r\nhas its own name, generally chosen carefully, so as to express the\r\nspecial qualities of the animal; and all important family events are\r\nnarrated to the _bees_—a custom which is found also in Westphalia.\r\nWhether by the help of the bees or not, the Wend farming is especially\r\nprosperous; and when a poor Bohemian peasant has a son born to him he\r\nbinds him to the end of a long pole and turns his face toward Lusatia,\r\nthat he may be as lucky as the Wends, who live there.\r\n\r\nThe peculiarity of the peasant’s language consists chiefly in his\r\nretention of historical peculiarities, which gradually disappear under\r\nthe friction of cultivated circles.  He prefers any proper name that may\r\nbe given to a day in the calendar, rather than the abstract date, by\r\nwhich he very rarely reckons.  In the baptismal names of his children he\r\nis guided by the old custom of the country, not at all by whim and fancy.\r\nMany old baptismal names, formerly common in Germany, would have become\r\nextinct but for their preservation among the peasantry, especially in\r\nNorth Germany; and so firmly have they adhered to local tradition in this\r\nmatter that it would be possible to give a sort of topographical\r\nstatistics of proper names, and distinguish a district by its rustic\r\nnames as we do by its Flora and Fauna.  The continuous inheritance of\r\ncertain favorite proper names in a family, in some districts, forces the\r\npeasant to adopt the princely custom of attaching a numeral to the name,\r\nand saying, when three generations are living at once, Hans I., II., and\r\nIII.; or—in the more antique fashion—Hans the elder, the middle, and the\r\nyounger.  In some of our English counties there is a similar adherence to\r\na narrow range of proper names, and a mode of distinguishing collateral\r\nbranches in the same family, you will hear of Jonathan’s Bess, Thomas’s\r\nBess, and Samuel’s Bess—the three Bessies being cousins.\r\n\r\nThe peasant’s adherence to the traditional has much greater inconvenience\r\nthan that entailed by a paucity of proper names.  In the Black Forest and\r\nin Hüttenberg you will see him in the dog-days wearing a thick fur cap,\r\nbecause it is an historical fur cap—a cap worn by his grandfather.  In\r\nthe Wetterau, that peasant girl is considered the handsomest who wears\r\nthe most petticoats.  To go to field-labor in seven petticoats can be\r\nanything but convenient or agreeable, but it is the traditionally correct\r\nthing, and a German peasant girl would think herself as unfavorably\r\nconspicuous in an untraditional costume as an English servant-girl would\r\nnow think herself in a “linsey-wolsey” apron or a thick muslin cap.  In\r\nmany districts no medical advice would induce the rustic to renounce the\r\ntight leather belt with which he injures his digestive functions; you\r\ncould more easily persuade him to smile on a new communal system than on\r\nthe unhistorical invention of braces.  In the eighteenth century, in\r\nspite of the philanthropic preachers of potatoes, the peasant for years\r\nthrew his potatoes to the pigs and the dogs, before he could be persuaded\r\nto put them on his own table.  However, the unwillingness of the peasant\r\nto adopt innovations has a not unreasonable foundation in the fact that\r\nfor him experiments are practical, not theoretical, and must be made with\r\nexpense of money instead of brains—a fact that is not, perhaps,\r\nsufficiently taken into account by agricultural theorists, who complain\r\nof the farmer’s obstinacy.  The peasant has the smallest possible faith\r\nin theoretic knowledge; he thinks it rather dangerous than otherwise, as\r\nis well indicated by a Lower Rhenish proverb—“One is never too old to\r\nlearn, said an old woman; so she learned to be a witch.”\r\n\r\nBetween many villages an historical feud, once perhaps the occasion of\r\nmuch bloodshed, is still kept up under the milder form of an occasional\r\nround of cudgelling and the launching of traditional nicknames.  An\r\nhistorical feud of this kind still exists, for example, among many\r\nvillages on the Rhine and more inland places in the neighborhood.\r\n_Rheinschnacke_ (of which the equivalent is perhaps “water-snake”) is the\r\nstanding term of ignominy for the inhabitant of the Rhine village, who\r\nrepays it in kind by the epithet “karst” (mattock), or “kukuk” (cuckoo),\r\naccording as the object of his hereditary hatred belongs to the field or\r\nthe forest.  If any Romeo among the “mattocks” were to marry a Juliet\r\namong the “water-snakes,” there would be no lack of Tybalts and Mercutios\r\nto carry the conflict from words to blows, though neither side knows a\r\nreason for the enmity.\r\n\r\nA droll instance of peasant conservatism is told of a village on the\r\nTaunus, whose inhabitants, from time immemorial, had been famous for\r\nimpromptu cudgelling.  For this historical offence the magistrates of the\r\ndistrict had always inflicted the equally historical punishment of\r\nshutting up the most incorrigible offenders, not in prison, but in their\r\nown pig-sty.  In recent times, however, the government, wishing to\r\ncorrect the rudeness of these peasants, appointed an “enlightened” man as\r\na magistrate, who at once abolished the original penalty above mentioned.\r\nBut this relaxation of punishment was so far from being welcome to the\r\nvillagers that they presented a petition praying that a more energetic\r\nman might be given them as a magistrate, who would have the courage to\r\npunish according to law and justice, “as had been beforetime.”  And the\r\nmagistrate who abolished incarceration in the pig-sty could never obtain\r\nthe respect of the neighborhood.  This happened no longer ago than the\r\nbeginning of the present century.\r\n\r\nBut it must not be supposed that the historical piety of the German\r\npeasant extends to anything not immediately connected with himself.  He\r\nhas the warmest piety toward the old tumble-down house which his\r\ngrandfather built, and which nothing will induce him to improve, but\r\ntoward the venerable ruins of the old castle that overlooks his village\r\nhe has no piety at all, and carries off its stones to make a fence for\r\nhis garden, or tears down the gothic carving of the old monastic church,\r\nwhich is “nothing to him,” to mark off a foot-path through his field.  It\r\nis the same with historical traditions.  The peasant has them fresh in\r\nhis memory, so far as they relate to himself.  In districts where the\r\npeasantry are unadulterated, you can discern the remnants of the feudal\r\nrelations in innumerable customs and phrases, but you will ask in vain\r\nfor historical traditions concerning the empire, or even concerning the\r\nparticular princely house to which the peasant is subject.  He can tell\r\nyou what “half people and whole people” mean; in Hesse you will still\r\nhear of “four horses making a whole peasant,” or of “four-day and\r\nthree-day peasants;” but you will ask in vain about Charlemagne and\r\nFrederic Barbarossa.\r\n\r\nRiehl well observes that the feudal system, which made the peasant the\r\nbondman of his lord, was an immense benefit in a country, the greater\r\npart of which had still to be colonized—rescued the peasant from\r\nvagabondage, and laid the foundation of persistency and endurance in\r\nfuture generations.  If a free German peasantry belongs only to modern\r\ntimes, it is to his ancestor who was a serf, and even, in the earliest\r\ntimes, a slave, that the peasant owes the foundation of his independence,\r\nnamely, his capability of a settled existence—nay, his unreasoning\r\npersistency, which has its important function in the development of the\r\nrace.\r\n\r\nPerhaps the very worst result of that unreasoning persistency is the\r\npeasant’s inveterate habit of litigation.  Every one remembers the\r\nimmortal description of Dandle Dinmont’s importunate application to\r\nLawyer Pleydell to manage his “bit lawsuit,” till at length Pleydell\r\nconsents to help him to ruin himself, on the ground that Dandle may fall\r\ninto worse hands.  It seems this is a scene which has many parallels in\r\nGermany.  The farmer’s lawsuit is his point of honor; and he will carry\r\nit through, though he knows from the very first day that he shall get\r\nnothing by it.  The litigious peasant piques himself, like Mr.\r\nSaddletree, on his knowledge of the law, and this vanity is the chief\r\nimpulse to many a lawsuit.  To the mind of the peasant, law presents\r\nitself as the “custom of the country,” and it is his pride to be versed\r\nin all customs.  _Custom with him holds the place of sentiment_, _of\r\ntheory_, _and in many cases of affection_.  Riehl justly urges the\r\nimportance of simplifying law proceedings, so as to cut off this vanity\r\nat its source, and also of encouraging, by every possible means, the\r\npractice of arbitration.\r\n\r\nThe peasant never begins his lawsuit in summer, for the same reason that\r\nhe does not make love and marry in summer—because he has no time for that\r\nsort of thing.  Anything is easier to him than to move out of his\r\nhabitual course, and he is attached even to his privations.  Some years\r\nago a peasant youth, out of the poorest and remotest region of the\r\nWesterwald, was enlisted as a recruit, at Weilburg in Nassau.  The lad,\r\nhaving never in his life slept in a bed, when he had got into one for the\r\nfirst time began to cry like a child; and he deserted twice because he\r\ncould not reconcile himself to sleeping in a bed, and to the “fine” life\r\nof the barracks: he was homesick at the thought of his accustomed poverty\r\nand his thatched hut.  A strong contrast, this, with the feeling of the\r\npoor in towns, who would be far enough from deserting because their\r\ncondition was too much improved!  The genuine peasant is never ashamed of\r\nhis rank and calling; he is rather inclined to look down on every one who\r\ndoes not wear a smock frock, and thinks a man who has the manners of the\r\ngentry is likely to be rather windy and unsubstantial.  In some places,\r\neven in French districts, this feeling is strongly symbolized by the\r\npractice of the peasantry, on certain festival days, to dress the images\r\nof the saints in peasant’s clothing.  History tells us of all kinds of\r\npeasant insurrections, the object of which was to obtain relief for the\r\npeasants from some of their many oppressions; but of an effort on their\r\npart to step out of their hereditary rank and calling, to become gentry,\r\nto leave the plough and carry on the easier business of capitalists or\r\ngovernment functionaries, there is no example.\r\n\r\nThe German novelists who undertake to give pictures of peasant-life fall\r\ninto the same mistake as our English novelists: they transfer their own\r\nfeelings to ploughmen and woodcutters, and give them both joys and\r\nsorrows of which they know nothing.  The peasant never questions the\r\nobligation of family ties—he questions _no custom_—but tender affection,\r\nas it exists among the refined part of mankind, is almost as foreign to\r\nhim as white hands and filbert-shaped nails.  That the aged father who\r\nhas given up his property to his children on condition of their\r\nmaintaining him for the remainder of his life, is very far from meeting\r\nwith delicate attentions, is indicated by the proverb current among the\r\npeasantry—“Don’t take your clothes off before you go to bed.”  Among\r\nrustic moral tales and parables, not one is more universal than the story\r\nof the ungrateful children, who made their gray-headed father, dependent\r\non them for a maintenance, eat at a wooden trough because he shook the\r\nfood out of his trembling hands.  Then these same ungrateful children\r\nobserved one day that their own little boy was making a tiny wooden\r\ntrough; and when they asked him what it was for, he answered—that his\r\nfather and mother might eat out of it, when he was a man and had to keep\r\nthem.\r\n\r\nMarriage is a very prudential affair, especially among the peasants who\r\nhave the largest share of property.  Politic marriages are as common\r\namong them as among princes; and when a peasant-heiress in Westphalia\r\nmarries, her husband adopts her name, and places his own after it with\r\nthe prefix _geborner_ (_née_).  The girls marry young, and the rapidity\r\nwith which they get old and ugly is one among the many proofs that the\r\nearly years of marriage are fuller of hardships than of conjugal\r\ntenderness.  “When our writers of village stories,” says Riehl,\r\n“transferred their own emotional life to the peasant, they obliterated\r\nwhat is precisely his most predominant characteristic, namely, that with\r\nhim general custom holds the place of individual feeling.”\r\n\r\nWe pay for greater emotional susceptibility too often by nervous diseases\r\nof which the peasant knows nothing.  To him headache is the least of\r\nphysical evils, because he thinks head-work the easiest and least\r\nindispensable of all labor.  Happily, many of the younger sons in peasant\r\nfamilies, by going to seek their living in the towns, carry their hardy\r\nnervous system to amalgamate with the overwrought nerves of our town\r\npopulation, and refresh them with a little rude vigor.  And a return to\r\nthe habits of peasant life is the best remedy for many moral as well as\r\nphysical diseases induced by perverted civilization.  Riehl points to\r\ncolonization as presenting the true field for this regenerative process.\r\nOn the other side of the ocean a man will have the courage to begin life\r\nagain as a peasant, while at home, perhaps, opportunity as well as\r\ncourage will fail him.  _Apropos_ of this subject of emigration, he\r\nremarks the striking fact, that the native shrewdness and mother-wit of\r\nthe German peasant seem to forsake him entirely when he has to apply them\r\nunder new circumstances, and on relations foreign to his experience.\r\nHence it is that the German peasant who emigrates, so constantly falls a\r\nvictim to unprincipled adventurers in the preliminaries to emigration;\r\nbut if once he gets his foot on the American soil he exhibits all the\r\nfirst-rate qualities of an agricultural colonist; and among all German\r\nemigrants the peasant class are the most successful.\r\n\r\nBut many disintegrating forces have been at work on the peasant\r\ncharacter, and degeneration is unhappily going on at a greater pace than\r\ndevelopment.  In the wine districts especially, the inability of the\r\nsmall proprietors to bear up under the vicissitudes of the market, or to\r\ninsure a high quality of wine by running the risks of a late vintage and\r\nthe competition of beer and cider with the inferior wines, have tended to\r\nproduce that uncertainty of gain which, with the peasant, is the\r\ninevitable cause of demoralization.  The small peasant proprietors are\r\nnot a new class in Germany, but many of the evils of their position are\r\nnew.  They are more dependent on ready money than formerly; thus, where a\r\npeasant used to get his wood for building and firing from the common\r\nforest, he has now to pay for it with hard cash; he used to thatch his\r\nown house, with the help perhaps of a neighbor, but now he pays a man to\r\ndo it for him; he used to pay taxes in kind, he now pays them in money.\r\nThe chances of the market have to be discounted, and the peasant falls\r\ninto the hands of money-lenders.  Here is one of the cases in which\r\nsocial policy clashes with a purely economical policy.\r\n\r\nPolitical vicissitudes have added their influence to that of economical\r\nchanges in disturbing that dim instinct, that reverence for traditional\r\ncustom, which is the peasant’s principle of action.  He is in the midst\r\nof novelties for which he knows no reason—changes in political geography,\r\nchanges of the government to which he owes fealty, changes in\r\nbureaucratic management and police regulations.  He finds himself in a\r\nnew element before an apparatus for breathing in it is developed in him.\r\nHis only knowledge of modern history is in some of its results—for\r\ninstance, that he has to pay heavier taxes from year to year.  His chief\r\nidea of a government is of a power that raises his taxes, opposes his\r\nharmless customs, and torments him with new formalities.  The source of\r\nall this is the false system of “enlightening” the peasant which has been\r\nadopted by the bureaucratic governments.  A system which disregards the\r\ntraditions and hereditary attachments of the peasant, and appeals only to\r\na logical understanding which is not yet developed in him, is simply\r\ndisintegrating and ruinous to the peasant character.  The interference\r\nwith the communal regulations has been of this fatal character.  Instead\r\nof endeavoring to promote to the utmost the healthy life of the Commune,\r\nas an organism the conditions of which are bound up with the historical\r\ncharacteristics of the peasant, the bureaucratic plan of government is\r\nbent on improvement by its patent machinery of state-appointed\r\nfunctionaries and off-hand regulations in accordance with modern\r\nenlightenment.  The spirit of communal exclusiveness—the resistance to\r\nthe indiscriminate establishment of strangers, is an intense traditional\r\nfeeling in the peasant.  “This gallows is for us and our children,” is\r\nthe typical motto of this spirit.  But such exclusiveness is highly\r\nirrational and repugnant to modern liberalism; therefore a bureaucratic\r\ngovernment at once opposes it, and encourages to the utmost the\r\nintroduction of new inhabitants in the provincial communes.  Instead of\r\nallowing the peasants to manage their own affairs, and, if they happen to\r\nbelieve that five and four make eleven, to unlearn the prejudice by their\r\nown experience in calculation, so that they may gradually understand\r\nprocesses, and not merely see results, bureaucracy comes with its “Ready\r\nReckoner” and works all the peasant’s sums for him—the surest way of\r\nmaintaining him in his stupidity, however it may shake his prejudice.\r\n\r\nAnother questionable plan for elevating the peasant is the supposed\r\nelevation of the clerical character by preventing the clergyman from\r\ncultivating more than a trifling part of the land attached to his\r\nbenefice; that he may be as much as possible of a scientific theologian,\r\nand as little as possible of a peasant.  In this, Riehl observes, lies\r\none great source of weakness to the Protestant Church as compared with\r\nthe Catholic, which finds the great majority of its priests among the\r\nlower orders; and we have had the opportunity of making an analogous\r\ncomparison in England, where many of us can remember country districts in\r\nwhich the great mass of the people were christianized by illiterate\r\nMethodist and Independent ministers, while the influence of the parish\r\nclergyman among the poor did not extend much beyond a few old women in\r\nscarlet cloaks and a few exceptional church-going laborers.\r\n\r\nBearing in mind the general characteristics of the German peasant, it is\r\neasy to understand his relation to the revolutionary ideas and\r\nrevolutionary movements of modern times.  The peasant, in Germany as\r\nelsewhere, is a born grumbler.  He has always plenty of grievances in his\r\npocket, but he does not generalize those grievances; he does not complain\r\nof “government” or “society,” probably because he has good reason to\r\ncomplain of the burgomaster.  When a few sparks from the first French\r\nRevolution fell among the German peasantry, and in certain villages of\r\nSaxony the country people assembled together to write down their demands,\r\nthere was no glimpse in their petition of the “universal rights of man,”\r\nbut simply of their own particular affairs as Saxon peasants.  Again,\r\nafter the July revolution of 1830, there were many insignificant peasant\r\ninsurrections; but the object of almost all was the removal of local\r\ngrievances.  Toll-houses were pulled down; stamped paper was destroyed;\r\nin some places there was a persecution of wild boars, in others, of that\r\nplentiful tame animal, the German _Rath_, or councillor who is never\r\ncalled into council.  But in 1848 it seemed as if the movements of the\r\npeasants had taken a new character; in the small western states of\r\nGermany it seemed as if the whole class of peasantry was in insurrection.\r\nBut, in fact, the peasant did not know the meaning of the part he was\r\nplaying.  He had heard that everything was being set right in the towns,\r\nand that wonderful things were happening there, so he tied up his bundle\r\nand set off.  Without any distinct object or resolution, the country\r\npeople presented themselves on the scene of commotion, and were warmly\r\nreceived by the party leaders.  But, seen from the windows of ducal\r\npalaces and ministerial hotels, these swarms of peasants had quite\r\nanother aspect, and it was imagined that they had a common plan of\r\nco-operation.  This, however, the peasants have never had.  Systematic\r\nco-operation implies general conceptions, and a provisional subordination\r\nof egoism, to which even the artisans of towns have rarely shown\r\nthemselves equal, and which are as foreign to the mind of the peasant as\r\nlogarithms or the doctrine of chemical proportions.  And the\r\nrevolutionary fervor of the peasant was soon cooled.  The old mistrust of\r\nthe towns was reawakened on the spot.  The Tyrolese peasants saw no great\r\ngood in the freedom of the press and the constitution, because these\r\nchanges “seemed to please the gentry so much.”  Peasants who had given\r\ntheir voices stormily for a German parliament asked afterward, with a\r\ndoubtful look, whether it were to consist of infantry or cavalry.  When\r\nroyal domains were declared the property of the State, the peasants in\r\nsome small principalities rejoiced over this, because they interpreted it\r\nto mean that every one would have his share in them, after the manner of\r\nthe old common and forest rights.\r\n\r\nThe very practical views of the peasants with regard to the demands of\r\nthe people were in amusing contrast with the abstract theorizing of the\r\neducated townsmen.  The peasant continually withheld all State payments\r\nuntil he saw how matters would turn out, and was disposed to reckon up\r\nthe solid benefit, in the form of land or money, that might come to him\r\nfrom the changes obtained.  While the townsman was heating his brains\r\nabout representation on the broadest basis, the peasant asked if the\r\nrelation between tenant and landlord would continue as before, and\r\nwhether the removal of the “feudal obligations” meant that the farmer\r\nshould become owner of the land!\r\n\r\nIt is in the same naïve way that Communism is interpreted by the German\r\npeasantry.  The wide spread among them of communistic doctrines, the\r\neagerness with which they listened to a plan for the partition of\r\nproperty, seemed to countenance the notion that it was a delusion to\r\nsuppose the peasant would be secured from this intoxication by his love\r\nof secure possession and peaceful earnings.  But, in fact, the peasant\r\ncontemplated “partition” by the light of an historical reminiscence\r\nrather than of novel theory.  The golden age, in the imagination of the\r\npeasant, was the time when every member of the commune had a right to as\r\nmuch wood from the forest as would enable him to sell some, after using\r\nwhat he wanted in firing—in which the communal possessions were so\r\nprofitable that, instead of his having to pay rates at the end of the\r\nyear, each member of the commune was something in pocket.  Hence the\r\npeasants in general understood by “partition,” that the State lands,\r\nespecially the forests, would be divided among the communes, and that, by\r\nsome political legerdemain or other, everybody would have free fire-wood,\r\nfree grazing for his cattle, and over and above that, a piece of gold\r\nwithout working for it.  That he should give up a single clod of his own\r\nto further the general “partition” had never entered the mind of the\r\npeasant communist; and the perception that this was an essential\r\npreliminary to “partition” was often a sufficient cure for his Communism.\r\n\r\nIn villages lying in the neighborhood of large towns, however, where the\r\ncircumstances of the peasantry are very different, quite another\r\ninterpretation of Communism is prevalent.  Here the peasant is generally\r\nsunk to the position of the proletaire living from hand to mouth: he has\r\nnothing to lose, but everything to gain by “partition.”  The coarse\r\nnature of the peasant has here been corrupted into bestiality by the\r\ndisturbance of his instincts, while he is as yet incapable of principles;\r\nand in this type of the degenerate peasant is seen the worst example of\r\nignorance intoxicated by theory.\r\n\r\nA significant hint as to the interpretation the peasants put on\r\nrevolutionary theories may be drawn from the way they employed the few\r\nweeks in which their movements were unchecked.  They felled the forest\r\ntrees and shot the game; they withheld taxes; they shook off the\r\nimaginary or real burdens imposed on them by their mediatized princes, by\r\npresenting their “demands” in a very rough way before the ducal or\r\nprincely “Schloss;” they set their faces against the bureaucratic\r\nmanagement of the communes, deposed the government functionaries who had\r\nbeen placed over them as burgomasters and magistrates, and abolished the\r\nwhole bureaucratic system of procedure, simply by taking no notice of its\r\nregulations, and recurring to some tradition—some old order or disorder\r\nof things.  In all this it is clear that they were animated not in the\r\nleast by the spirit of modern revolution, but by a purely narrow and\r\npersonal impulse toward reaction.\r\n\r\nThe idea of constitutional government lies quite beyond the range of the\r\nGerman peasant’s conceptions.  His only notion of representation is that\r\nof a representation of ranks—of classes; his only notion of a deputy is\r\nof one who takes care, not of the national welfare, but of the interests\r\nof his own order.  Herein lay the great mistake of the democratic party,\r\nin common with the bureaucratic governments, that they entirely omitted\r\nthe peculiar character of the peasant from their political calculations.\r\nThey talked of the “people” and forgot that the peasants were included in\r\nthe term.  Only a baseless misconception of the peasant’s character could\r\ninduce the supposition that he would feel the slightest enthusiasm about\r\nthe principles involved in the reconstitution of the Empire, or even\r\nabout the reconstitution itself.  He has no zeal for a written law, as\r\nsuch, but only so far as it takes the form of a living law—a tradition.\r\nIt was the external authority which the revolutionary party had won in\r\nBaden that attracted the peasants into a participation of the struggle.\r\n\r\nSuch, Riehl tells us, are the general characteristics of the German\r\npeasantry—characteristics which subsist amid a wide variety of\r\ncircumstances.  In Mecklenburg, Pomerania, and Brandenburg the peasant\r\nlives on extensive estates; in Westphalia he lives in large isolated\r\nhomesteads; in the Westerwald and in Sauerland, in little groups of\r\nvillages and hamlets; on the Rhine land is for the most part parcelled\r\nout among small proprietors, who live together in large villages.  Then,\r\nof course, the diversified physical geography of Germany gives rise to\r\nequally diversified methods of land-culture; and out of these various\r\ncircumstances grow numerous specific differences in manner and character.\r\nBut the generic character of the German peasant is everywhere the same;\r\nin the clean mountain hamlet and in the dirty fishing village on the\r\ncoast; in the plains of North Germany and in the backwoods of America.\r\n“Everywhere he has the same historical character—everywhere custom is his\r\nsupreme law.  Where religion and patriotism are still a naïve instinct,\r\nare still a sacred _custom_, there begins the class of the German\r\nPeasantry.”\r\n\r\n                                * * * * *\r\n\r\nOur readers will perhaps already have gathered from the foregoing\r\nportrait of the German peasant that Riehl is not a man who looks at\r\nobjects through the spectacles either of the doctrinaire or the dreamer;\r\nand they will be ready to believe what he tells us in his Preface,\r\nnamely, that years ago he began his wanderings over the hills and plains\r\nof Germany for the sake of obtaining, in immediate intercourse with the\r\npeople, that completion of his historical, political, and economical\r\nstudies which he was unable to find in books.  He began his\r\ninvestigations with no party prepossessions, and his present views were\r\nevolved entirely from his own gradually amassed observations.  He was,\r\nfirst of all, a pedestrian, and only in the second place a political\r\nauthor.  The views at which he has arrived by this inductive process, he\r\nsums up in the term—_social-political-conservatism_; but his conservatism\r\nis, we conceive, of a thoroughly philosophical kind.  He sees in European\r\nsociety _incarnate history_, and any attempt to disengage it from its\r\nhistorical elements must, he believes, be simply destructive of social\r\nvitality. {164}  What has grown up historically can only die out\r\nhistorically, by the gradual operation of necessary laws.  The external\r\nconditions which society has inherited from the past are but the\r\nmanifestation of inherited internal conditions in the human beings who\r\ncompose it; the internal conditions and the external are related to each\r\nother as the organism and its medium, and development can take place only\r\nby the gradual consentaneous development of both.  Take the familiar\r\nexample of attempts to abolish titles, which have been about as effective\r\nas the process of cutting off poppy-heads in a cornfield.  _Jedem\r\nMenschem_, says Riehl, _ist sein Zopf angeboren_, _warum soll denn der\r\nsociale Sprachgebrauch nicht auch sein Zopf haben_?—which we may\r\nrender—“As long as snobism runs in the blood, why should it not run in\r\nour speech?”  As a necessary preliminary to a purely rational society,\r\nyou must obtain purely rational men, free from the sweet and bitter\r\nprejudices of hereditary affection and antipathy; which is as easy as to\r\nget running streams without springs, or the leafy shade of the forest\r\nwithout the secular growth of trunk and branch.\r\n\r\nThe historical conditions of society may be compared with those of\r\nlanguage.  It must be admitted that the language of cultivated nations is\r\nin anything but a rational state; the great sections of the civilized\r\nworld are only approximatively intelligible to each other, and even that\r\nonly at the cost of long study; one word stands for many things, and many\r\nwords for one thing; the subtle shades of meaning, and still subtler\r\nechoes of association, make language an instrument which scarcely\r\nanything short of genius can wield with definiteness and certainty.\r\nSuppose, then, that the effect which has been again and again made to\r\nconstruct a universal language on a rational basis has at length\r\nsucceeded, and that you have a language which has no uncertainty, no\r\nwhims of idiom, no cumbrous forms, no fitful simmer of many-hued\r\nsignificance, no hoary Archaisms “familiar with forgotten years”—a patent\r\ndeodorized and non-resonant language, which effects the purpose of\r\ncommunication as perfectly and rapidly as algebraic signs.  Your language\r\nmay be a perfect medium of expression to science, but will never express\r\n_life_, which is a great deal more than science.  With the anomalies and\r\ninconveniences of historical language you will have parted with its music\r\nand its passions, and its vital qualities as an expression of individual\r\ncharacter, with its subtle capabilities of wit, with everything that\r\ngives it power over the imagination; and the next step in simplification\r\nwill be the invention of a talking watch, which will achieve the utmost\r\nfacility and despatch in the communication of ideas by a graduated\r\nadjustment of ticks, to be represented in writing by a corresponding\r\narrangement of dots.  A melancholy “language of the future!”  The sensory\r\nand motor nerves that run in the same sheath are scarcely bound together\r\nby a more necessary and delicate union than that which binds men’s\r\naffections, imagination, wit and humor, with the subtle ramifications of\r\nhistorical language.  Language must be left to grow in precision,\r\ncompleteness, and unity, as minds grow in clearness, comprehensiveness,\r\nand sympathy.  And there is an analogous relation between the moral\r\ntendencies of men and the social conditions they have inherited.  The\r\nnature of European men has its roots intertwined with the past, and can\r\nonly be developed by allowing those roots to remain undisturbed while the\r\nprocess of development is going on until that perfect ripeness of the\r\nseed which carries with it a life independent of the root.  This vital\r\nconnection with the past is much more vividly felt on the Continent than\r\nin England, where we have to recall it by an effort of memory and\r\nreflection; for though our English life is in its core intensely\r\ntraditional, Protestantism and commerce have modernized the face of the\r\nland and the aspects of society in a far greater degree than in any\r\ncontinental country:\r\n\r\n    “Abroad,” says Ruskin, “a building of the eighth or tenth century\r\n    stands ruinous in the open streets; the children play round it, the\r\n    peasants heap their corn in it, the buildings of yesterday nestle\r\n    about it, and fit their new stones in its rents, and tremble in\r\n    sympathy as it trembles.  No one wonders at it, or thinks of it as\r\n    separate, and of another time; we feel the ancient world to be a real\r\n    thing; and one with the new; antiquity is no dream; it is rather the\r\n    children playing about the old stones that are the dream.  But all is\r\n    continuous; and the words “from generation to generation”\r\n    understandable here.”\r\n\r\nThis conception of European society as incarnate history is the\r\nfundamental idea of Riehl’s books.  After the notable failure of\r\nrevolutionary attempts conducted from the point of view of abstract\r\ndemocratic and socialistic theories, after the practical demonstration of\r\nthe evils resulting from a bureaucratic system, which governs by an\r\nundiscriminating, dead mechanism, Riehl wishes to urge on the\r\nconsideration of his countrymen a social policy founded on the special\r\nstudy of the people as they are—on the natural history of the various\r\nsocial ranks.  He thinks it wise to pause a little from theorizing, and\r\nsee what is the material actually present for theory to work upon.  It is\r\nthe glory of the Socialists—in contrast with the democratic doctrinaires\r\nwho have been too much occupied with the general idea of “the people” to\r\ninquire particularly into the actual life of the people—that they have\r\nthrown themselves with enthusiastic zeal into the study at least of one\r\nsocial group, namely, the factory operatives; and here lies the secret of\r\ntheir partial success.  But, unfortunately, they have made this special\r\nduty of a single fragment of society the basis of a theory which quietly\r\nsubstitutes for the small group of Parisian proletaires or English\r\nfactory-workers the society of all Europe—nay, of the whole world.  And\r\nin this way they have lost the best fruit of their investigations.  For,\r\nsays Riehl, the more deeply we penetrate into the knowledge of society in\r\nits details, the more thoroughly we shall be convinced that _a universal\r\nsocial policy has no validity except on paper_, and can never be carried\r\ninto successful practice.  The conditions of German society are\r\naltogether different from those of French, of English, or of Italian\r\nsociety; and to apply the same social theory to these nations\r\nindiscriminately is about as wise a procedure as Triptolemus Yellowley’s\r\napplication of the agricultural directions in Virgil’s “Georgics” to his\r\nfarm in the Shetland Isles.\r\n\r\nIt is the clear and strong light in which Riehl places this important\r\nposition that in our opinion constitutes the suggestive value of his\r\nbooks for foreign as well as German readers.  It has not been\r\nsufficiently insisted on, that in the various branches of Social Science\r\nthere is an advance from the general to the special, from the simple to\r\nthe complex, analogous with that which is found in the series of the\r\nsciences, from Mathematics to Biology.  To the laws of quantity comprised\r\nin Mathematics and Physics are superadded, in Chemistry, laws of quality;\r\nto these again are added, in Biology, laws of life; and lastly, the\r\nconditions of life in general branch out into its special conditions, or\r\nNatural History, on the one hand, and into its abnormal conditions, or\r\nPathology, on the other.  And in this series or ramification of the\r\nsciences, the more general science will not suffice to solve the problems\r\nof the more special.  Chemistry embraces phenomena which are not\r\nexplicable by Physics; Biology embraces phenomena which are not\r\nexplicable by Chemistry; and no biological generalization will enable us\r\nto predict the infinite specialities produced by the complexity of vital\r\nconditions.  So Social Science, while it has departments which in their\r\nfundamental generality correspond to mathematics and physics, namely,\r\nthose grand and simple generalizations which trace out the inevitable\r\nmarch of the human race as a whole, and, as a ramification of these, the\r\nlaws of economical science, has also, in the departments of government\r\nand jurisprudence, which embrace the conditions of social life in all\r\ntheir complexity, what may be called its Biology, carrying us on to\r\ninnumerable special phenomena which outlie the sphere of science, and\r\nbelong to Natural History.  And just as the most thorough acquaintance\r\nwith physics, or chemistry, or general physiology, will not enable you at\r\nonce to establish the balance of life in your private vivarium, so that\r\nyour particular society of zoophytes, mollusks, and echinoderms may feel\r\nthemselves, as the Germans say, at ease in their skin; so the most\r\ncomplete equipment of theory will not enable a statesman or a political\r\nand social reformer to adjust his measures wisely, in the absence of a\r\nspecial acquaintance with the section of society for which he legislates,\r\nwith the peculiar characteristics of the nation, the province, the class\r\nwhose well-being he has to consult.  In other words, a wise social policy\r\nmust be based not simply on abstract social science, but on the natural\r\nhistory of social bodies.\r\n\r\nRiehl’s books are not dedicated merely to the argumentative maintenance\r\nof this or of any other position; they are intended chiefly as a\r\ncontribution to that knowledge of the German people on the importance of\r\nwhich he insists.  He is less occupied with urging his own conclusions\r\nthan with impressing on his readers the facts which have led him to those\r\nconclusions.  In the volume entitled “Land und Leute,” which, though\r\npublished last, is properly an introduction to the volume entitled “Die\r\nBürgerliche Gesellschaft,” he considers the German people in their\r\nphysical geographical relations; he compares the natural divisions of the\r\nrace, as determined by land and climate, and social traditions, with the\r\nartificial divisions which are based on diplomacy; and he traces the\r\ngenesis and influences of what we may call the ecclesiastical geography\r\nof Germany—its partition between Catholicism and Protestantism.  He shows\r\nthat the ordinary antithesis of North and South Germany represents no\r\nreal ethnographical distinction, and that the natural divisions of\r\nGermany, founded on its physical geography are threefold—namely, the low\r\nplains, the middle mountain region, and the high mountain region, or\r\nLower, Middle, and Upper Germany; and on this primary natural division\r\nall the other broad ethnographical distinctions of Germany will be\r\nfound to rest.  The plains of North or Lower Germany include all the\r\nseaboard the nation possesses; and this, together with the fact that they\r\nare traversed to the depth of 600 miles by navigable rivers, makes them\r\nthe natural seat of a trading race.  Quite different is the geographical\r\ncharacter of Middle Germany.  While the northern plains are marked off\r\ninto great divisions, by such rivers as the Lower Rhine, the Weser, and\r\nthe Oder, running almost in parallel lines, this central region is cut up\r\nlike a mosaic by the capricious lines of valleys and rivers.  Here is the\r\nregion in which you find those famous roofs from which the rain-water\r\nruns toward two different seas, and the mountain-tops from which you may\r\nlook into eight or ten German states.  The abundance of water-power and\r\nthe presence of extensive coal-mines allow of a very diversified\r\nindustrial development in Middle Germany.  In Upper Germany, or the high\r\nmountain region, we find the same symmetry in the lines of the rivers as\r\nin the north; almost all the great Alpine streams flow parallel with the\r\nDanube.  But the majority of these rivers are neither navigable nor\r\navailable for industrial objects, and instead of serving for\r\ncommunication they shut off one great tract from another.  The slow\r\ndevelopment, the simple peasant life of many districts is here determined\r\nby the mountain and the river.  In the south-east, however, industrial\r\nactivity spreads through Bohemia toward Austria, and forms a sort of\r\nbalance to the industrial districts of the Lower Rhine.  Of course, the\r\nboundaries of these three regions cannot be very strictly defined; but an\r\napproximation to the limits of Middle Germany may be obtained by\r\nregarding it as a triangle, of which one angle lies in Silesia, another\r\nin Aix-la-Chapelle, and a third at Lake Constance.\r\n\r\nThis triple division corresponds with the broad distinctions of climate.\r\nIn the northern plains the atmosphere is damp and heavy; in the southern\r\nmountain region it is dry and rare, and there are abrupt changes of\r\ntemperature, sharp contrasts between the seasons, and devastating storms;\r\nbut in both these zones men are hardened by conflict with the roughness\r\nof the climate.  In Middle Germany, on the contrary, there is little of\r\nthis struggle; the seasons are more equable, and the mild, soft air of\r\nthe valleys tends to make the inhabitants luxurious and sensitive to\r\nhardships.  It is only in exceptional mountain districts that one is here\r\nreminded of the rough, bracing air on the heights of Southern Germany.\r\nIt is a curious fact that, as the air becomes gradually lighter and rarer\r\nfrom the North German coast toward Upper Germany, the average of suicides\r\nregularly decreases.  Mecklenburg has the highest number, then Prussia,\r\nwhile the fewest suicides occur in Bavaria and Austria.\r\n\r\nBoth the northern and southern regions have still a large extent of waste\r\nlands, downs, morasses, and heaths; and to these are added, in the south,\r\nabundance of snow-fields and naked rock; while in Middle Germany culture\r\nhas almost over-spread the face of the land, and there are no large\r\ntracts of waste.  There is the same proportion in the distribution of\r\nforests.  Again, in the north we see a monotonous continuity of\r\nwheat-fields, potato-grounds, meadow-lands, and vast heaths, and there is\r\nthe same uniformity of culture over large surfaces in the southern\r\ntable-lands and the Alpine pastures.  In Middle Germany, on the contrary,\r\nthere is a perpetual variety of crops within a short space; the diversity\r\nof land surface and the corresponding variety in the species of plants\r\nare an invitation to the splitting up of estates, and this again\r\nencourages to the utmost the motley character of the cultivation.\r\n\r\nAccording to this threefold division, it appears that there are certain\r\nfeatures common to North and South Germany in which they differ from\r\nCentral Germany, and the nature of this difference Riehl indicates by\r\ndistinguishing the former as _Centralized Land_ and the latter as\r\n_Individualized Land_; a distinction which is well symbolized by the fact\r\nthat North and South Germany possess the great lines of railway which are\r\nthe medium for the traffic of the world, while Middle Germany is far\r\nricher in lines for local communication, and possesses the greatest\r\nlength of railway within the smallest space.  Disregarding\r\nsuperficialities, the East Frieslanders, the Schleswig-Holsteiners, the\r\nMecklenburghers, and the Pomeranians are much more nearly allied to the\r\nold Bavarians, the Tyrolese, and the Styrians than any of these are\r\nallied to the Saxons, the Thuringians, or the Rhinelanders.  Both in\r\nNorth and South Germany original races are still found in large masses,\r\nand popular dialects are spoken; you still find there thoroughly peasant\r\ndistricts, thorough villages, and also, at great intervals, thorough\r\ncities; you still find there a sense of rank.  In Middle Germany, on the\r\ncontrary, the original races are fused together or sprinkled hither and\r\nthither; the peculiarities of the popular dialects are worn down or\r\nconfused; there is no very strict line of demarkation between the country\r\nand the town population, hundreds of small towns and large villages being\r\nhardly distinguishable in their characteristics; and the sense of rank,\r\nas part of the organic structure of society, is almost extinguished.\r\nAgain, both in the north and south there is still a strong ecclesiastical\r\nspirit in the people, and the Pomeranian sees Antichrist in the Pope as\r\nclearly as the Tyrolese sees him in Doctor Luther; while in Middle\r\nGermany the confessions are mingled, they exist peaceably side by side in\r\nvery narrow space, and tolerance or indifference has spread itself widely\r\neven in the popular mind.  And the analogy, or rather the causal relation\r\nbetween the physical geography of the three regions and the development\r\nof the population goes still further:\r\n\r\n    “For,” observes Riehl, “the striking connection which has been\r\n    pointed out between the local geological formations in Germany and\r\n    the revolutionary disposition of the people has more than a\r\n    metaphorical significance.  Where the primeval physical revolutions\r\n    of the globe have been the wildest in their effects, and the most\r\n    multiform strata have been tossed together or thrown one upon the\r\n    other, it is a very intelligible consequence that on a land surface\r\n    thus broken up, the population should sooner develop itself into\r\n    small communities, and that the more intense life generated in these\r\n    smaller communities should become the most favorable nidus for the\r\n    reception of modern culture, and with this a susceptibility for its\r\n    revolutionary ideas; while a people settled in a region where its\r\n    groups are spread over a large space will persist much more\r\n    obstinately in the retention of its original character.  The people\r\n    of Middle Germany have none of that exclusive one-sidedness which\r\n    determines the peculiar genius of great national groups, just as this\r\n    one-sidedness or uniformity is wanting to the geological and\r\n    geographical character of their land.”\r\n\r\nThis ethnographical outline Riehl fills up with special and typical\r\ndescriptions, and then makes it the starting-point for a criticism of the\r\nactual political condition of Germany.  The volume is full of vivid\r\npictures, as well as penetrating glances into the maladies and tendencies\r\nof modern society.  It would be fascinating as literature if it were not\r\nimportant for its facts and philosophy.  But we can only commend it to\r\nour readers, and pass on to the volume entitled “Die Bürgerliche\r\nGesellschaft,” from which we have drawn our sketch of the German\r\npeasantry.  Here Riehl gives us a series of studies in that natural\r\nhistory of the people which he regards as the proper basis of social\r\npolicy.  He holds that, in European society, there are _three natural\r\nranks or estates_: the hereditary landed aristocracy, the citizens or\r\ncommercial class, and the peasantry or agricultural class.  By _natural\r\nranks_ he means ranks which have their roots deep in the historical\r\nstructure of society, and are still, in the present, showing vitality\r\nabove ground; he means those great social groups which are not only\r\ndistinguished externally by their vocation, but essentially by their\r\nmental character, their habits, their mode of life—by the principle they\r\nrepresent in the historical development of society.  In his conception of\r\nthe “Fourth Estate” he differs from the usual interpretation, according\r\nto which it is simply equivalent to the Proletariat, or those who are\r\ndependent on daily wages, whose only capital is their skill or bodily\r\nstrength—factory operatives, artisans, agricultural laborers, to whom\r\nmight be added, especially in Germany, the day-laborers with the quill,\r\nthe literary proletariat.  This, Riehl observes, is a valid basis of\r\neconomical classification, but not of social classification.  In his\r\nview, the Fourth Estate is a stratum produced by the perpetual abrasion\r\nof the other great social groups; it is the sign and result of the\r\ndecomposition which is commencing in the organic constitution of society.\r\nIts elements are derived alike from the aristocracy, the bourgeoisie, and\r\nthe peasantry.  It assembles under its banner the deserters of historical\r\nsociety, and forms them into a terrible army, which is only just awaking\r\nto the consciousness of its corporate power.  The tendency of this Fourth\r\nEstate, by the very process of its formation, is to do away with the\r\ndistinctive historical character of the other estates, and to resolve\r\ntheir peculiar rank and vocation into a uniform social relation founded\r\non an abstract conception of society.  According to Riehl’s\r\nclassification, the day-laborers, whom the political economist designates\r\nas the Fourth Estate, belong partly to the peasantry or agricultural\r\nclass, and partly to the citizens or commercial class.\r\n\r\nRiehl considers, in the first place, the peasantry and aristocracy as the\r\n“Forces of social persistence,” and, in the second, the bourgeoisie and\r\nthe “fourth Estate” as the “Forces of social movement.”\r\n\r\nThe aristocracy, he observes, is the only one among these four groups\r\nwhich is denied by others besides Socialists to have any natural basis as\r\na separate rank.  It is admitted that there was once an aristocracy which\r\nhad an intrinsic ground of existence, but now, it is alleged, this is an\r\nhistorical fossil, an antiquarian relic, venerable because gray with age.\r\nIt what, it is asked, can consist the peculiar vocation of the\r\naristocracy, since it has no longer the monopoly of the land, of the\r\nhigher military functions, and of government offices, and since the\r\nservice of the court has no longer any political importance?  To this\r\nRiehl replies, that in great revolutionary crises, the “men of progress”\r\nhave more than once “abolished” the aristocracy.  But, remarkably enough,\r\nthe aristocracy has always reappeared.  This measure of abolition showed\r\nthat the nobility were no longer regarded as a real class, for to abolish\r\na real class would be an absurdity.  It is quite possible to contemplate\r\na voluntary breaking up of the peasant or citizen class in the\r\nsocialistic sense, but no man in his senses would think of straightway\r\n“abolishing” citizens and peasants.  The aristocracy, then, was regarded\r\nas a sort of cancer, or excrescence of society.  Nevertheless, not only\r\nhas it been found impossible to annihilate an hereditary nobility by\r\ndecree, but also the aristocracy of the eighteenth century outlived even\r\nthe self-destructive acts of its own perversity.  A life which was\r\nentirely without object, entirely destitute of functions, would not, says\r\nRiehl, be so persistent.  He has an acute criticism of those who conduct\r\na polemic against the idea of an hereditary aristocracy while they are\r\nproposing an “aristocracy of talent,” which after all is based on the\r\nprinciple of inheritance.  The Socialists are, therefore, only consistent\r\nin declaring against an aristocracy of talent.  “But when they have\r\nturned the world into a great Foundling Hospital they will still be\r\nunable to eradicate the ‘privileges of birth.’”  We must not follow him\r\nin his criticism, however; nor can we afford to do more than mention\r\nhastily his interesting sketch of the mediæval aristocracy, and his\r\nadmonition to the German aristocracy of the present day, that the\r\nvitality of their class is not to be sustained by romantic attempts to\r\nrevive mediæval forms and sentiments, but only by the exercise of\r\nfunctions as real and salutary for actual society as those of the\r\nmediæval aristocracy were for the feudal age.  “In modern society the\r\ndivisions of rank indicate _division of labor_, according to that\r\ndistribution of functions in the social organism which the historical\r\nconstitution of society has determined.  In this way the principle of\r\ndifferentiation and the principle of unity are identical.”\r\n\r\nThe elaborate study of the German bourgeoisie, which forms the next\r\ndivision of the volume, must be passed over, but we may pause a moment to\r\nnote Riehl’s definition of the social _Philister_ (Philistine), an\r\nepithet for which we have no equivalent, not at all, however, for want of\r\nthe object it represents.  Most people who read a little German know that\r\nthe epithet _Philister_ originated in the _Burschen-leben_, or\r\nStudent-life of Germany, and that the antithesis of _Bursch_ and\r\n_Philister_ was equivalent to the antithesis of “gown” and “town;” but\r\nsince the word has passed into ordinary language it has assumed several\r\nshades of significance which have not yet been merged into a single,\r\nabsolute meaning; and one of the questions which an English visitor in\r\nGermany will probably take an opportunity of asking is, “What is the\r\nstrict meaning of the word _Philister_?”  Riehl’s answer is, that the\r\n_Philister_ “is one who is indifferent to all social interests, all\r\npublic life, as distinguished from selfish and private interests; he has\r\nno sympathy with political and social events except as they affect his\r\nown comfort and prosperity, as they offer him material for amusement or\r\nopportunity for gratifying his vanity.  He has no social or political\r\ncreed, but is always of the opinion which is most convenient for the\r\nmoment.  He is always in the majority, and is the main element of\r\nunreason and stupidity in the judgment of a “discerning public.”  It\r\nseems presumptuous in us to dispute Riehl’s interpretation of a German\r\nword, but we must think that, in literature, the epithet _Philister_ has\r\nusually a wider meaning than this—includes his definition and something\r\nmore.  We imagine the _Philister_ is the personification of the spirit\r\nwhich judges everything from a lower point of view than the subject\r\ndemands; which judges the affairs of the parish from the egotistic or\r\npurely personal point of view; which judges the affairs of the nation\r\nfrom the parochial point of view, and does not hesitate to measure the\r\nmerits of the universe from the human point of view.  At least this must\r\nsurely be the spirit to which Goethe alludes in a passage cited by Riehl\r\nhimself, where he says that the Germans need not be ashamed of erecting a\r\nmonument to him as well as to Blucher; for if Blucher had freed them from\r\nthe French, he (Goethe) had freed them from the nets of the _Philister_:\r\n\r\n    “Ihr mögt mirimmer ungescheut\r\n    Gleich Blüchern Denkmal setzen!\r\n    Von Franzosen hat er euch befreit,\r\n    Ich von Philister-netzen.”\r\n\r\nGoethe could hardly claim to be the apostle of public spirit; but he is\r\neminently the man who helps us to rise to a lofty point of observation,\r\nso that we may see things in their relative proportions.\r\n\r\nThe most interesting chapters in the description of the “Fourth Estate,”\r\nwhich concludes the volume, are those on the “Aristocratic Proletariat”\r\nand the “Intellectual Proletariat.”  The Fourth Estate in Germany, says\r\nRiehl, has its centre of gravity not, as in England and France, in the\r\nday laborers and factory operatives, and still less in the degenerate\r\npeasantry.  In Germany the _educated_ proletariat is the leaven that sets\r\nthe mass in fermentation; the dangerous classes there go about, not in\r\nblouses, but in frock coats; they begin with the impoverished prince and\r\nend in the hungriest _littérateur_.  The custom that all the sons of a\r\nnobleman shall inherit their father’s title necessarily goes on\r\nmultiplying that class of aristocrats who are not only without function\r\nbut without adequate provision, and who shrink from entering the ranks of\r\nthe citizens by adopting some honest calling.  The younger son of a\r\nprince, says Riehl, is usually obliged to remain without any vocation;\r\nand however zealously he may study music, painting, literature, or\r\nscience, he can never be a regular musician, painter, or man of science;\r\nhis pursuit will be called a “passion,” not a “calling,” and to the end\r\nof his days he remains a dilettante.  “But the ardent pursuit of a fixed\r\npractical calling can alone satisfy the active man.”  Direct legislation\r\ncannot remedy this evil.  The inheritance of titles by younger sons is\r\nthe universal custom, and custom is stronger than law.  But if all\r\ngovernment preference for the “aristocratic proletariat” were withdrawn,\r\nthe sensible men among them would prefer emigration, or the pursuit of\r\nsome profession, to the hungry distinction of a title without rents.\r\n\r\nThe intellectual proletaires Riehl calls the “church militant” of the\r\nFourth Estate in Germany.  In no other country are they so numerous; in\r\nno other country is the trade in material and industrial capital so far\r\nexceeded by the wholesale and retail trade, the traffic and the usury, in\r\nthe intellectual capital of the nation.  _Germany yields more\r\nintellectual produce than it can use and pay for_.\r\n\r\n    “This over-production, which is not transient but permanent, nay, is\r\n    constantly on the increase, evidences a diseased state of the\r\n    national industry, a perverted application of industrial powers, and\r\n    is a far more pungent satire on the national condition than all the\r\n    poverty of operatives and peasants. . . . Other nations need not envy\r\n    us the preponderance of the intellectual proletariat over the\r\n    proletaires of manual labor.  For man more easily becomes diseased\r\n    from over-study than from the labor of the hands; and it is precisely\r\n    in the intellectual proletariat that there are the most dangerous\r\n    seeds of disease.  This is the group in which the opposition between\r\n    earnings and wants, between the ideal social position and the real,\r\n    is the most hopelessly irreconcilable.”\r\n\r\nWe must unwillingly leave our readers to make acquaintance for themselves\r\nwith the graphic details with which Riehl follows up this general\r\nstatement; but before quitting these admirable volumes, let us say, lest\r\nour inevitable omissions should have left room for a different\r\nconclusion, that Riehl’s conservatism is not in the least tinged with the\r\npartisanship of a class, with a poetic fanaticism for the past, or with\r\nthe prejudice of a mind incapable of discerning the grander evolution of\r\nthings to which all social forms are but temporarily subservient.  It is\r\nthe conservatism of a clear-eyed, practical, but withal large-minded\r\nman—a little caustic, perhaps, now and then in his epigrams on democratic\r\ndoctrinaires who have their nostrum for all political and social\r\ndiseases, and on communistic theories which he regards as “the despair of\r\nthe individual in his own manhood, reduced to a system,” but nevertheless\r\nable and willing to do justice to the elements of fact and reason in\r\nevery shade of opinion and every form of effort.  He is as far as\r\npossible from the folly of supposing that the sun will go backward on the\r\ndial because we put the hands of our clock backward; he only contends\r\nagainst the opposite folly of decreeing that it shall be mid-day while in\r\nfact the sun is only just touching the mountain-tops, and all along the\r\nvalley men are stumbling in the twilight.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nVI.  SILLY NOVELS BY LADY NOVELISTS.\r\n\r\n\r\nSilly Novels by Lady Novelists are a genus with many species, determined\r\nby the particular quality of silliness that predominates in them—the\r\nfrothy, the prosy, the pious, or the pedantic.  But it is a mixture of\r\nall these—a composite order of feminine fatuity—that produces the largest\r\nclass of such novels, which we shall distinguish as the\r\n_mind-and-millinery_ species.  The heroine is usually an heiress,\r\nprobably a peeress in her own right, with perhaps a vicious baronet, an\r\namiable duke, and an irresistible younger son of a marquis as lovers in\r\nthe foreground, a clergyman and a poet sighing for her in the middle\r\ndistance, and a crowd of undefined adorers dimly indicated beyond.  Her\r\neyes and her wit are both dazzling; her nose and her morals are alike\r\nfree from any tendency to irregularity; she has a superb _contralto_ and\r\na superb intellect; she is perfectly well dressed and perfectly\r\nreligious; she dances like a sylph, and reads the Bible in the original\r\ntongues.  Or it may be that the heroine is not an heiress—that rank and\r\nwealth are the only things in which she is deficient; but she infallibly\r\ngets into high society, she has the triumph of refusing many matches and\r\nsecuring the best, and she wears some family jewels or other as a sort of\r\ncrown of righteousness at the end.  Rakish men either bite their lips in\r\nimpotent confusion at her repartees, or are touched to penitence by her\r\nreproofs, which, on appropriate occasions, rise to a lofty strain of\r\nrhetoric; indeed, there is a general propensity in her to make speeches,\r\nand to rhapsodize at some length when she retires to her bedroom.  In her\r\nrecorded conversations she is amazingly eloquent, and in her unrecorded\r\nconversations amazingly witty.  She is understood to have a depth of\r\ninsight that looks through and through the shallow theories of\r\nphilosophers, and her superior instincts are a sort of dial by which men\r\nhave only to set their clocks and watches, and all will go well.  The men\r\nplay a very subordinate part by her side.  You are consoled now and then\r\nby a hint that they have affairs, which keeps you in mind that the\r\nworking-day business of the world is somehow being carried on, but\r\nostensibly the final cause of their existence is that they may accompany\r\nthe heroine on her “starring” expedition through life.  They see her at a\r\nball, and they are dazzled; at a flower-show, and they are fascinated; on\r\na riding excursion, and they are witched by her noble horsemanship; at\r\nchurch, and they are awed by the sweet solemnity of her demeanor.  She is\r\nthe ideal woman in feelings, faculties, and flounces.  For all this she\r\nas often as not marries the wrong person to begin with, and she suffers\r\nterribly from the plots and intrigues of the vicious baronet; but even\r\ndeath has a soft place in his heart for such a paragon, and remedies all\r\nmistakes for her just at the right moment.  The vicious baronet is sure\r\nto be killed in a duel, and the tedious husband dies in his bed\r\nrequesting his wife, as a particular favor to him, to marry the man she\r\nloves best, and having already dispatched a note to the lover informing\r\nhim of the comfortable arrangement.  Before matters arrive at this\r\ndesirable issue our feelings are tried by seeing the noble, lovely, and\r\ngifted heroine pass through many _mauvais moments_, but we have the\r\nsatisfaction of knowing that her sorrows are wept into embroidered\r\npocket-handkerchiefs, that her fainting form reclines on the very best\r\nupholstery, and that whatever vicissitudes she may undergo, from being\r\ndashed out of her carriage to having her head shaved in a fever, she\r\ncomes out of them all with a complexion more blooming and locks more\r\nredundant than ever.\r\n\r\nWe may remark, by the way, that we have been relieved from a serious\r\nscruple by discovering that silly novels by lady novelists rarely\r\nintroduce us into any other than very lofty and fashionable society.  We\r\nhad imagined that destitute women turned novelists, as they turned\r\ngovernesses, because they had no other “ladylike” means of getting their\r\nbread.  On this supposition, vacillating syntax, and improbable incident\r\nhad a certain pathos for us, like the extremely supererogatory\r\npincushions and ill-devised nightcaps that are offered for sale by a\r\nblind man.  We felt the commodity to be a nuisance, but we were glad to\r\nthink that the money went to relieve the necessitous, and we pictured to\r\nourselves lonely women struggling for a maintenance, or wives and\r\ndaughters devoting themselves to the production of “copy” out of pure\r\nheroism—perhaps to pay their husband’s debts or to purchase luxuries for\r\na sick father.  Under these impressions we shrank from criticising a\r\nlady’s novel: her English might be faulty, but we said to ourselves her\r\nmotives are irreproachable; her imagination may be uninventive, but her\r\npatience is untiring.  Empty writing was excused by an empty stomach, and\r\ntwaddle was consecrated by tears.  But no!  This theory of ours, like\r\nmany other pretty theories, has had to give way before observation.\r\nWomen’s silly novels, we are now convinced, are written under totally\r\ndifferent circumstances.  The fair writers have evidently never talked to\r\na tradesman except from a carriage window; they have no notion of the\r\nworking-classes except as “dependents;” they think five hundred a year a\r\nmiserable pittance; Belgravia and “baronial halls” are their primary\r\ntruths; and they have no idea of feeling interest in any man who is not\r\nat least a great landed proprietor, if not a prime minister.  It is clear\r\nthat they write in elegant boudoirs, with violet-colored ink and a ruby\r\npen; that they must be entirely indifferent to publishers’ accounts, and\r\ninexperienced in every form of poverty except poverty of brains.  It is\r\ntrue that we are constantly struck with the want of verisimilitude in\r\ntheir representations of the high society in which they seem to live; but\r\nthen they betray no closer acquaintance with any other form of life.  If\r\ntheir peers and peeresses are improbable, their literary men,\r\ntradespeople, and cottagers are impossible; and their intellect seems to\r\nhave the peculiar impartiality of reproducing both what they _have_ seen\r\nand heard, and what they have _not_ seen and heard, with equal\r\nunfaithfulness.\r\n\r\nThere are few women, we suppose, who have not seen something of children\r\nunder five years of age, yet in “Compensation,” a recent novel of the\r\nmind-and-millinery species, which calls itself a “story of real life,” we\r\nhave a child of four and a half years old talking in this Ossianic\r\nfashion:\r\n\r\n    “‘Oh, I am so happy, dear grand mamma;—I have seen—I have seen such a\r\n    delightful person; he is like everything beautiful—like the smell of\r\n    sweet flowers, and the view from Ben Lemond;—or no, _better than\r\n    that_—he is like what I think of and see when I am very, very happy;\r\n    and he is really like mamma, too, when she sings; and his forehead is\r\n    like _that distant sea_,’ she continued, pointing to the blue\r\n    Mediterranean; ‘there seems no end—no end; or like the clusters of\r\n    stars I like best to look at on a warm fine night. . . . Don’t look\r\n    so . . . your forehead is like Loch Lomond, when the wind is blowing\r\n    and the sun is gone in; I like the sunshine best when the lake is\r\n    smooth. . . . So now—I like it better than ever . . . It is more\r\n    beautiful still from the dark cloud that has gone over it, _when the\r\n    sun suddenly lights up all the colors of the forests and shining\r\n    purple rocks_, _and it is all reflected in the waters below_.’”\r\n\r\nWe are not surprised to learn that the mother of this infant phenomenon,\r\nwho exhibits symptoms so alarmingly like those of adolescence repressed\r\nby gin, is herself a phœnix.  We are assured, again and again, that she\r\nhad a remarkably original in mind, that she was a genius, and “conscious\r\nof her originality,” and she was fortunate enough to have a lover who was\r\nalso a genius and a man of “most original mind.”\r\n\r\nThis lover, we read, though “wonderfully similar” to her “in powers and\r\ncapacity,” was “infinitely superior to her in faith and development,” and\r\nshe saw in him “‘Agape’—so rare to find—of which she had read and admired\r\nthe meaning in her Greek Testament; having, _from her great facility in\r\nlearning languages_, read the Scriptures in their original _tongues_.”\r\nOf course!  Greek and Hebrew are mere play to a heroine; Sanscrit is no\r\nmore than _a_ _b_ _c_ to her; and she can talk with perfect correctness\r\nin any language, except English.  She is a polking polyglot, a Creuzer in\r\ncrinoline.  Poor men.  There are so few of you who know even Hebrew; you\r\nthink it something to boast of if, like Bolingbroke, you only “understand\r\nthat sort of learning and what is writ about it;” and you are perhaps\r\nadoring women who can think slightingly of you in all the Semitic\r\nlanguages successively.  But, then, as we are almost invariably told that\r\na heroine has a “beautifully small head,” and as her intellect has\r\nprobably been early invigorated by an attention to costume and\r\ndeportment, we may conclude that she can pick up the Oriental tongues, to\r\nsay nothing of their dialects, with the same aërial facility that the\r\nbutterfly sips nectar.  Besides, there can be no difficulty in conceiving\r\nthe depth of the heroine’s erudition when that of the authoress is so\r\nevident.\r\n\r\nIn “Laura Gay,” another novel of the same school, the heroine seems less\r\nat home in Greek and Hebrew but she makes up for the deficiency by a\r\nquite playful familiarity with the Latin classics—with the “dear old\r\nVirgil,” “the graceful Horace, the humane Cicero, and the pleasant Livy;”\r\nindeed, it is such a matter of course with her to quote Latin that she\r\ndoes it at a picnic in a very mixed company of ladies and gentlemen,\r\nhaving, we are told, “no conception that the nobler sex were capable of\r\njealousy on this subject.  And if, indeed,” continues the biographer of\r\nLaura Gray, “the wisest and noblest portion of that sex were in the\r\nmajority, no such sentiment would exist; but while Miss Wyndhams and Mr.\r\nRedfords abound, great sacrifices must be made to their existence.”  Such\r\nsacrifices, we presume, as abstaining from Latin quotations, of extremely\r\nmoderate interest and applicability, which the wise and noble minority of\r\nthe other sex would be quite as willing to dispense with as the foolish\r\nand ignoble majority.  It is as little the custom of well-bred men as of\r\nwell-bred women to quote Latin in mixed parties; they can contain their\r\nfamiliarity with “the humane Cicero” without allowing it to boil over in\r\nordinary conversation, and even references to “the pleasant Livy” are not\r\nabsolutely irrepressible.  But Ciceronian Latin is the mildest form of\r\nMiss Gay’s conversational power.  Being on the Palatine with a party of\r\nsight-seers, she falls into the following vein of well-rounded remark:\r\n“Truth can only be pure objectively, for even in the creeds where it\r\npredominates, being subjective, and parcelled out into portions, each of\r\nthese necessarily receives a hue of idiosyncrasy, that is, a taint of\r\nsuperstition more or less strong; while in such creeds as the Roman\r\nCatholic, ignorance, interest, the basis of ancient idolatries, and the\r\nforce of authority, have gradually accumulated on the pure truth, and\r\ntransformed it, at last, into a mass of superstition for the majority of\r\nits votaries; and how few are there, alas! whose zeal, courage, and\r\nintellectual energy are equal to the analysis of this accumulation, and\r\nto the discovery of the pearl of great price which lies hidden beneath\r\nthis heap of rubbish.”  We have often met with women much more novel and\r\nprofound in their observations than Laura Gay, but rarely with any so\r\ninopportunely long-winded.  A clerical lord, who is half in love with\r\nher, is alarmed by the daring remarks just quoted, and begins to suspect\r\nthat she is inclined to free-thinking.  But he is mistaken; when in a\r\nmoment of sorrow he delicately begs leave to “recall to her memory, a\r\n_depôt_ of strength and consolation under affliction, which, until we are\r\nhard pressed by the trials of life, we are too apt to forget,” we learn\r\nthat she really has “recurrence to that sacred depôt,” together with the\r\ntea-pot.  There is a certain flavor of orthodoxy mixed with the parade of\r\nfortunes and fine carriages in “Laura Gay,” but it is an orthodoxy\r\nmitigated by study of “the humane Cicero,” and by an “intellectual\r\ndisposition to analyze.”\r\n\r\n“Compensation” is much more heavily dosed with doctrine, but then it has\r\na treble amount of snobbish worldliness and absurd incident to tickle the\r\npalate of pious frivolity.  Linda, the heroine, is still more speculative\r\nand spiritual than Laura Gay, but she has been “presented,” and has more\r\nand far grander lovers; very wicked and fascinating women are\r\nintroduced—even a French _lionne_; and no expense is spared to get up as\r\nexciting a story as you will find in the most immoral novels.  In fact,\r\nit is a wonderful _pot pourri_ of Almack’s, Scotch second-sight, Mr.\r\nRogers’s breakfasts, Italian brigands, death-bed conversions, superior\r\nauthoresses, Italian mistresses, and attempts at poisoning old ladies,\r\nthe whole served up with a garnish of talk about “faith and development”\r\nand “most original minds.”  Even Miss Susan Barton, the superior\r\nauthoress, whose pen moves in a “quick, decided manner when she is\r\ncomposing,” declines the finest opportunities of marriage; and though old\r\nenough to be Linda’s mother (since we are told that she refused Linda’s\r\nfather), has her hand sought by a young earl, the heroine’s rejected\r\nlover.  Of course, genius and morality must be backed by eligible offers,\r\nor they would seem rather a dull affair; and piety, like other things, in\r\norder to be _comme il faut_, must be in “society,” and have admittance to\r\nthe best circles.\r\n\r\n“Rank and Beauty” is a more frothy and less religious variety of the\r\nmind-and-millinery species.  The heroine, we are told, “if she inherited\r\nher father’s pride of birth and her mother’s beauty of person, had in\r\nherself a tone of enthusiastic feeling that, perhaps, belongs to her age\r\neven in the lowly born, but which is refined into the high spirit of wild\r\nromance only in the far descended, who feel that it is their best\r\ninheritance.”  This enthusiastic young lady, by dint of reading the\r\nnewspaper to her father, falls in love with the _prime minister_, who,\r\nthrough the medium of leading articles and “the _resumé_ of the debates,”\r\nshines upon her imagination as a bright particular star, which has no\r\nparallax for her living in the country as simple Miss Wyndham.  But she\r\nforthwith becomes Baroness Umfraville in her own right, astonishes the\r\nworld with her beauty and accomplishments when she bursts upon it from\r\nher mansion in Spring Gardens, and, as you foresee, will presently come\r\ninto contact with the unseen _objet aimé_.  Perhaps the words “prime\r\nminister” suggest to you a wrinkled or obese sexagenarian; but pray\r\ndismiss the image.  Lord Rupert Conway has been “called while still\r\nalmost a youth to the first situation which a subject can hold in the\r\n_universe_,” and even leading articles and a _resumé_ of the debates have\r\nnot conjured up a dream that surpasses the fact.\r\n\r\n    “The door opened again, and Lord Rupert Conway entered.  Evelyn gave\r\n    one glance.  It was enough; she was not disappointed.  It seemed as\r\n    if a picture on which she had long gazed was suddenly instinct with\r\n    life, and had stepped from its frame before her.  His tall figure,\r\n    the distinguished simplicity of his air—it was a living Vandyke, a\r\n    cavalier, one of his noble cavalier ancestors, or one to whom her\r\n    fancy had always likened him, who long of yore had with an Umfraville\r\n    fought the Paynim far beyond the sea.  Was this reality?”\r\n\r\nVery little like it, certainly.\r\n\r\nBy and by it becomes evident that the ministerial heart is touched.  Lady\r\nUmfraville is on a visit to the Queen at Windsor, and—\r\n\r\n    “The last evening of her stay, when they returned from riding, Mr.\r\n    Wyndham took her and a large party to the top of the Keep, to see the\r\n    view.  She was leaning on the battlements, gazing from that ‘stately\r\n    height’ at the prospect beneath her, when Lord Rupert was by her\r\n    side.  ‘What an unrivalled view!’ exclaimed she.\r\n\r\n    “‘Yes, it would have been wrong to go without having been up here.\r\n    You are pleased with your visit?’\r\n\r\n    “‘Enchanted!  A Queen to live and die under, to live and die for!’\r\n\r\n    “‘Ha!’ cried he, with sudden emotion, and with a _eureka_ expression\r\n    of countenance, as if he had _indeed found a heart in unison with his\r\n    own_.”\r\n\r\nThe “_eureka_ expression of countenance” you see at once to be prophetic\r\nof marriage at the end of the third volume; but before that desirable\r\nconsummation there are very complicated misunderstandings, arising\r\nchiefly from the vindictive plotting of Sir Luttrel Wycherley, who is a\r\ngenius, a poet, and in every way a most remarkable character indeed.  He\r\nis not only a romantic poet, but a hardened rake and a cynical wit; yet\r\nhis deep passion for Lady Umfraville has so impoverished his epigrammatic\r\ntalent that he cuts an extremely poor figure in conversation.  When she\r\nrejects him, he rushes into the shrubbery and rolls himself in the dirt;\r\nand on recovering, devotes himself to the most diabolical and laborious\r\nschemes of vengeance, in the course of which he disguises himself as a\r\nquack physician and enters into general practice, foreseeing that Evelyn\r\nwill fall ill, and that he shall be called in to attend her.  At last,\r\nwhen all his schemes are frustrated, he takes leave of her in a long\r\nletter, written, as you will perceive from the following passage,\r\nentirely in the style of an eminent literary man:\r\n\r\n    “Oh, lady, nursed in pomp and pleasure, will you ever cast one\r\n    thought upon the miserable being who addresses you?  Will you ever,\r\n    as your gilded galley is floating down the unruffled stream of\r\n    prosperity, will you ever, while lulled by the sweetest music—thine\r\n    own praises—hear the far-off sigh from that world to which I am\r\n    going?”\r\n\r\nOn the whole, however, frothy as it is, we rather prefer “Rank and\r\nBeauty” to the two other novels we have mentioned.  The dialogue is more\r\nnatural and spirited; there is some frank ignorance and no pedantry; and\r\nyou are allowed to take the heroine’s astounding intellect upon trust,\r\nwithout being called on to read her conversational refutations of\r\nsceptics and philosophers, or her rhetorical solutions of the mysteries\r\nof the universe.\r\n\r\nWriters of the mind-and-millinery school are remarkably unanimous in\r\ntheir choice of diction.  In their novels there is usually a lady or\r\ngentleman who is more or less of a upas tree; the lover has a manly\r\nbreast; minds are redolent of various things; hearts are hollow; events\r\nare utilized; friends are consigned to the tomb; infancy is an engaging\r\nperiod; the sun is a luminary that goes to his western couch, or gathers\r\nthe rain-drops into his refulgent bosom; life is a melancholy boon;\r\nAlbion and Scotia are conversational epithets.  There is a striking\r\nresemblance, too, in the character of their moral comments, such, for\r\ninstance, as that “It is a fact, no less true than melancholy, that all\r\npeople, more or less, richer or poorer, are swayed by bad example;” that\r\n“Books, however trivial, contain some subjects from which useful\r\ninformation may be drawn;” that “Vice can too often borrow the language\r\nof virtue;” that “Merit and nobility of nature must exist, to be\r\naccepted, for clamor and pretension cannot impose upon those too well\r\nread in human nature to be easily deceived;” and that “In order to\r\nforgive, we must have been injured.”  There is doubtless a class of\r\nreaders to whom these remarks appear peculiarly pointed and pungent; for\r\nwe often find them doubly and trebly scored with the pencil, and delicate\r\nhands giving in their determined adhesion to these hardy novelties by a\r\ndistinct _très vrai_, emphasized by many notes of exclamation.  The\r\ncolloquial style of these novels is often marked by much ingenious\r\ninversion, and a careful avoidance of such cheap phraseology as can be\r\nheard every day.  Angry young gentlemen exclaim, “’Tis ever thus,\r\nmethinks;” and in the half hour before dinner a young lady informs her\r\nnext neighbor that the first day she read Shakespeare she “stole away\r\ninto the park, and beneath the shadow of the greenwood tree, devoured\r\nwith rapture the inspired page of the great magician.”  But the most\r\nremarkable efforts of the mind-and-millinery writers lie in their\r\nphilosophic reflections.  The authoress of “Laura Gay,” for example,\r\nhaving married her hero and heroine, improves the event by observing that\r\n“if those sceptics, whose eyes have so long gazed on matter that they can\r\nno longer see aught else in man, could once enter with heart and soul,\r\ninto such bliss as this, they would come to say that the soul of man and\r\nthe polypus are not of common origin, or of the same texture.”  Lady\r\nnovelists, it appears, can see something else besides matter; they are\r\nnot limited to phenomena, but can relieve their eyesight by occasional\r\nglimpses of the _noumenon_, and are, therefore, naturally better able\r\nthan any one else to confound sceptics, even of that remarkable but to us\r\nunknown school which maintains that the soul of man is of the same\r\ntexture as the polypus.\r\n\r\nThe most pitiable of all silly novels by lady novelists are what we may\r\ncall the _oracular_ species—novels intended to expound the writer’s\r\nreligious, philosophical, or moral theories.  There seems to be a notion\r\nabroad among women, rather akin to the superstition that the speech and\r\nactions of idiots are inspired, and that the human being most entirely\r\nexhausted of common-sense is the fittest vehicle of revelation.  To judge\r\nfrom their writings, there are certain ladies who think that an amazing\r\nignorance, both of science and of life, is the best possible\r\nqualification for forming an opinion on the knottiest moral and\r\nspeculative questions.  Apparently, their recipe for solving all such\r\ndifficulties is something like this: Take a woman’s head, stuff it with a\r\nsmattering of philosophy and literature chopped small, and with false\r\nnotions of society baked hard, let it hang over a desk a few hours every\r\nday, and serve up hot in feeble English when not required.  You will\r\nrarely meet with a lady novelist of the oracular class who is diffident\r\nof her ability to decide on theological questions—who has any suspicion\r\nthat she is not capable of discriminating with the nicest accuracy\r\nbetween the good and evil in all church parties—who does not see\r\nprecisely how it is that men have gone wrong hitherto—and pity\r\nphilosophers in general that they have not had the opportunity of\r\nconsulting her.  Great writers, who have modestly contented themselves\r\nwith putting their experience into fiction, and have thought it quite a\r\nsufficient task to exhibit men and things as they are, she sighs over as\r\ndeplorably deficient in the application of their powers.  “They have\r\nsolved no great questions”—and she is ready to remedy their omission by\r\nsetting before you a complete theory of life and manual of divinity in a\r\nlove story, where ladies and gentlemen of good family go through genteel\r\nvicissitudes, to the utter confusion of Deists, Puseyites, and\r\nultra-Protestants, and to the perfect establishment of that peculiar view\r\nof Christianity which either condenses itself into a sentence of small\r\ncaps, or explodes into a cluster of stars on the three hundred and\r\nthirtieth page.  It is true, the ladies and gentlemen will probably seem\r\nto you remarkably little like any you have had the fortune or misfortune\r\nto meet with, for, as a general rule, the ability of a lady novelist to\r\ndescribe actual life and her fellow-men is in inverse proportion to her\r\nconfident eloquence about God and the other world, and the means by which\r\nshe usually chooses to conduct you to true ideas of the invisible is a\r\ntotally false picture of the visible.\r\n\r\nAs typical a novel of the oracular kind as we can hope to meet with, is\r\n“The Enigma: a Leaf from the Chronicles of the Wolchorley House.”  The\r\n“enigma” which this novel is to solve is certainly one that demands\r\npowers no less gigantic than those of a lady novelist, being neither more\r\nnor less than the existence of evil.  The problem is stated and the\r\nanswer dimly foreshadowed on the very first page.  The spirited young\r\nlady, with raven hair, says, “All life is an inextricable confusion;” and\r\nthe meek young lady, with auburn hair, looks at the picture of the\r\nMadonna which she is copying, and—“_There_ seemed the solution of that\r\nmighty enigma.”  The style of this novel is quite as lofty as its\r\npurpose; indeed, some passages on which we have spent much patient study\r\nare quite beyond our reach, in spite of the illustrative aid of italics\r\nand small caps; and we must await further “development” in order to\r\nunderstand them.  Of Ernest, the model young clergyman, who sets every\r\none right on all occasions, we read that “he held not of marriage in the\r\nmarketable kind, after a social desecration;” that, on one eventful\r\nnight, “sleep had not visited his divided heart, where tumultuated, in\r\nvaried type and combination, the aggregate feelings of grief and joy;”\r\nand that, “for the _marketable_ human article he had no toleration, be it\r\nof what sort, or set for what value it might, whether for worship or\r\nclass, his upright soul abhorred it, whose ultimatum, the self-deceiver,\r\nwas to him THE _great spiritual lie_, ‘living in a vain show, deceiving\r\nand being deceived;’ since he did not suppose the phylactery and enlarged\r\nborder on the garment to be _merely_ a social trick.”  (The italics and\r\nsmall caps are the author’s, and we hope they assist the reader’s\r\ncomprehension.)  Of Sir Lionel, the model old gentleman, we are told that\r\n“the simple ideal of the middle age, apart from its anarchy and\r\ndecadence, in him most truly seemed to live again, when the ties which\r\nknit men together were of heroic cast.  The first-born colors of pristine\r\nfaith and truth engraven on the common soul of man, and blent into the\r\nwide arch of brotherhood, where the primæval law of _order_ grew and\r\nmultiplied each perfect after his kind, and mutually interdependent.”\r\nYou see clearly, of course, how colors are first engraven on the soul,\r\nand then blent into a wide arch, on which arch of colors—apparently a\r\nrainbow—the law of order grew and multiplied, each—apparently the arch\r\nand the law—perfect after his kind?  If, after this, you can possibly\r\nwant any further aid toward knowing what Sir Lionel was, we can tell you\r\nthat in his soul “the scientific combinations of thought could educe no\r\nfuller harmonies of the good and the true than lay in the primæval pulses\r\nwhich floated as an atmosphere around it!” and that, when he was sealing\r\na letter, “Lo! the responsive throb in that good man’s bosom echoed back\r\nin simple truth the honest witness of a heart that condemned him not, as\r\nhis eye, bedewed with love, rested, too, with something of ancestral\r\npride, on the undimmed motto of the family—‘LOIAUTE.’”\r\n\r\nThe slightest matters have their vulgarity fumigated out of them by the\r\nsame elevated style.  Commonplace people would say that a copy of\r\nShakespeare lay on a drawing-room table; but the authoress of “The\r\nEnigma,” bent on edifying periphrasis, tells you that there lay on the\r\ntable, “that fund of human thought and feeling, which teaches the heart\r\nthrough the little name, ‘Shakespeare.’”  A watchman sees a light burning\r\nin an upper window rather longer than usual, and thinks that people are\r\nfoolish to sit up late when they have an opportunity of going to bed;\r\nbut, lest this fact should seem too low and common, it is presented to us\r\nin the following striking and metaphysical manner: “He marvelled—as a man\r\n_will_ think for others in a necessarily separate personality,\r\nconsequently (though disallowing it) in false mental premise—how\r\ndifferently _he_ should act, how gladly _he_ should prize the rest so\r\nlightly held of within.”  A footman—an ordinary Jeames, with large calves\r\nand aspirated vowels—answers the door-bell, and the opportunity is seized\r\nto tell you that he was a “type of the large class of pampered menials,\r\nwho follow the curse of Cain—‘vagabonds’ on the face of the earth, and\r\nwhose estimate of the human class varies in the graduated scale of money\r\nand expenditure. . . . These, and such as these, O England, be the false\r\nlights of thy morbid civilization!”  We have heard of various “false\r\nlights,” from Dr. Cumming to Robert Owen, from Dr. Pusey to the\r\nSpirit-rappers, but we never before heard of the false light that\r\nemanates from plush and powder.\r\n\r\nIn the same way very ordinary events of civilized life are exalted into\r\nthe most awful crises, and ladies in full skirts and _manches à la\r\nChinoise_, conduct themselves not unlike the heroines of sanguinary\r\nmelodramas.  Mrs. Percy, a shallow woman of the world, wishes her son\r\nHorace to marry the auburn-haired Grace, she being an heiress; but he,\r\nafter the manner of sons, falls in love with the raven-haired Kate, the\r\nheiress’s portionless cousin; and, moreover, Grace herself shows every\r\nsymptom of perfect indifference to Horace.  In such cases sons are often\r\nsulky or fiery, mothers are alternately manœuvring and waspish, and the\r\nportionless young lady often lies awake at night and cries a good deal.\r\nWe are getting used to these things now, just as we are used to eclipses\r\nof the moon, which no longer set us howling and beating tin kettles.  We\r\nnever heard of a lady in a fashionable “front” behaving like Mrs. Percy\r\nunder these circumstances.  Happening one day to see Horace talking to\r\nGrace at a window, without in the least knowing what they are talking\r\nabout, or having the least reason to believe that Grace, who is mistress\r\nof the house and a person of dignity, would accept her son if he were to\r\noffer himself, she suddenly rushes up to them and clasps them both,\r\nsaying, “with a flushed countenance and in an excited manner”—“This is\r\nindeed happiness; for, may I not call you so, Grace?—my Grace—my Horace’s\r\nGrace!—my dear children!”  Her son tells her she is mistaken, and that he\r\nis engaged to Kate, whereupon we have the following scene and tableau:\r\n\r\n    “Gathering herself up to an unprecedented height (!) her eyes\r\n    lightening forth the fire of her anger:\r\n\r\n    “‘Wretched boy!’ she said, hoarsely and scornfully, and clenching her\r\n    hand, ‘Take then the doom of your own choice!  Bow down your\r\n    miserable head and let a mother’s—’\r\n\r\n    “‘Curse not!’ spake a deep low voice from behind, and Mrs. Percy\r\n    started, scared, as though she had seen a heavenly visitant appear,\r\n    to break upon her in the midst of her sin.\r\n\r\n    “Meantime Horace had fallen on his knees, at her feet, and hid his\r\n    face in his hands.\r\n\r\n    “Who then, is she—who!  Truly his ‘guardian spirit’ hath stepped\r\n    between him and the fearful words, which, however unmerited, must\r\n    have hung as a pall over his future existence;—a spell which could\r\n    not be unbound—which could not be unsaid.\r\n\r\n    “Of an earthly paleness, but calm with the still, iron-bound calmness\r\n    of death—the only calm one there—Katherine stood; and her words smote\r\n    on the ear in tones whose appallingly slow and separate intonation\r\n    rung on the heart like a chill, isolated tolling of some fatal knell.\r\n\r\n    “‘He would have plighted me his faith, but I did not accept it; you\r\n    cannot, therefore—you _dare_ not curse him.  And here,’ she\r\n    continued, raising her hand to heaven, whither her large dark eyes\r\n    also rose with a chastened glow, which, for the first time,\r\n    _suffering_ had lighted in those passionate orbs—‘here I promise,\r\n    come weal, come woe, that Horace Wolchorley and I do never\r\n    interchange vows without his mother’s sanction—without his mother’s\r\n    blessing!’”\r\n\r\nHere, and throughout the story, we see that confusion of purpose which is\r\nso characteristic of silly novels written by women.  It is a story of\r\nquite modern drawing-room society—a society in which polkas are played\r\nand Puseyism discussed; yet we have characters, and incidents, and traits\r\nof manner introduced, which are mere shreds from the most heterogeneous\r\nromances.  We have a blind Irish harper, “relic of the picturesque bards\r\nof yore,” startling us at a Sunday-school festival of tea and cake in an\r\nEnglish village; we have a crazy gypsy, in a scarlet cloak, singing\r\nsnatches of romantic song, and revealing a secret on her death-bed which,\r\nwith the testimony of a dwarfish miserly merchant, who salutes strangers\r\nwith a curse and a devilish laugh, goes to prove that Ernest, the model\r\nyoung clergyman, is Kate’s brother; and we have an ultra-virtuous Irish\r\nBarney, discovering that a document is forged, by comparing the date of\r\nthe paper with the date of the alleged signature, although the same\r\ndocument has passed through a court of law and occasioned a fatal\r\ndecision.  The “Hall” in which Sir Lionel lives is the venerable\r\ncountry-seat of an old family, and this, we suppose, sets the imagination\r\nof the authoress flying to donjons and battlements, where “lo! the warder\r\nblows his horn;” for, as the inhabitants are in their bedrooms on a night\r\ncertainly within the recollection of Pleaceman X. and a breeze springs\r\nup, which we are at first told was faint, and then that it made the old\r\ncedars bow their branches to the greensward, she falls into this mediæval\r\nvein of description (the italics are ours): “The banner _unfurled it_ at\r\nthe sound, and shook its guardian wing above, while the startled owl\r\n_flapped her_ in the ivy; the firmament looking down through her ‘argus\r\neyes’—\r\n\r\n    ‘Ministers of heaven’s mute melodies.’\r\n\r\nAnd lo! two strokes tolled from out the warder tower, and ‘Two o’clock’\r\nre-echoed its interpreter below.”\r\n\r\nSuch stories as this of “The Enigma” remind us of the pictures clever\r\nchildren sometimes draw “out of their own head,” where you will see a\r\nmodern villa on the right, two knights in helmets fighting in the\r\nforeground, and a tiger grinning in a jungle on the left, the several\r\nobjects being brought together because the artist thinks each pretty, and\r\nperhaps still more because he remembers seeing them in other pictures.\r\n\r\nBut we like the authoress much better on her mediæval stilts than on her\r\noracular ones—when she talks of the _Ich_ and of “subjective” and\r\n“objective,” and lays down the exact line of Christian verity, between\r\n“right-hand excesses and left-hand declensions.”  Persons who deviate\r\nfrom this line are introduced with a patronizing air of charity.  Of a\r\ncertain Miss Inshquine she informs us, with all the lucidity of italics\r\nand small caps, that “_function_, not _form_, AS _the inevitable outer\r\nexpression of the spirit in this tabernacle age_, weakly engrossed her.”\r\nAnd _à propos_ of Miss Mayjar, an evangelical lady who is a little too\r\napt to talk of her visits to sick women and the state of their souls, we\r\nare told that the model clergyman is “not one to disallow, through the\r\n_super_ crust, the undercurrent toward good in the _subject_, or the\r\npositive benefits, nevertheless, to the _object_.”  We imagine the\r\ndouble-refined accent and protrusion of chin which are feebly represented\r\nby the italics in this lady’s sentences!  We abstain from quoting any of\r\nher oracular doctrinal passages, because they refer to matters too\r\nserious for our pages just now.\r\n\r\nThe epithet “silly” may seem impertinent, applied to a novel which\r\nindicates so much reading and intellectual activity as “The Enigma,” but\r\nwe use this epithet advisedly.  If, as the world has long agreed, a very\r\ngreat amount of instruction will not make a wise man, still less will a\r\nvery mediocre amount of instruction make a wise woman.  And the most\r\nmischievous form of feminine silliness is the literary form, because it\r\ntends to confirm the popular prejudice against the more solid education\r\nof women.\r\n\r\nWhen men see girls wasting their time in consultations about bonnets and\r\nball dresses, and in giggling or sentimental love-confidences, or\r\nmiddle-aged women mismanaging their children, and solacing themselves\r\nwith acrid gossip, they can hardly help saying, “For Heaven’s sake, let\r\ngirls be better educated; let them have some better objects of\r\nthought—some more solid occupations.”  But after a few hours’\r\nconversation with an oracular literary woman, or a few hours’ reading of\r\nher books, they are likely enough to say, “After all, when a woman gets\r\nsome knowledge, see what use she makes of it!  Her knowledge remains\r\nacquisition instead of passing into culture; instead of being subdued\r\ninto modesty and simplicity by a larger acquaintance with thought and\r\nfact, she has a feverish consciousness of her attainments; she keeps a\r\nsort of mental pocket-mirror, and is continually looking in it at her own\r\n‘intellectuality;’ she spoils the taste of one’s muffin by questions of\r\nmetaphysics; ‘puts down’ men at a dinner-table with her superior\r\ninformation; and seizes the opportunity of a _soirée_ to catechise us on\r\nthe vital question of the relation between mind and matter.  And then,\r\nlook at her writings!  She mistakes vagueness for depth, bombast for\r\neloquence, and affectation for originality; she struts on one page, rolls\r\nher eyes on another, grimaces in a third, and is hysterical in a fourth.\r\nShe may have read many writings of great men, and a few writings of great\r\nwomen; but she is as unable to discern the difference between her own\r\nstyle and theirs as a Yorkshireman is to discern the difference between\r\nhis own English and a Londoner’s: rhodomontade is the native accent of\r\nher intellect.  No—the average nature of women is too shallow and feeble\r\na soil to bear much tillage; it is only fit for the very lightest crops.”\r\n\r\nIt is true that the men who come to such a decision on such very\r\nsuperficial and imperfect observation may not be among the wisest in the\r\nworld; but we have not now to contest their opinion—we are only pointing\r\nout how it is unconsciously encouraged by many women who have volunteered\r\nthemselves as representatives of the feminine intellect.  We do not\r\nbelieve that a man was ever strengthened in such an opinion by\r\nassociating with a woman of true culture, whose mind had absorbed her\r\nknowledge instead of being absorbed by it.  A really cultured woman, like\r\na really cultured man, is all the simpler and the less obtrusive for her\r\nknowledge; it has made her see herself and her opinions in something like\r\njust proportions; she does not make it a pedestal from which she flatters\r\nherself that she commands a complete view of men and things, but makes it\r\na point of observation from which to form a right estimate of herself.\r\nShe neither spouts poetry nor quotes Cicero on slight provocation; not\r\nbecause she thinks that a sacrifice must be made to the prejudices of\r\nmen, but because that mode of exhibiting her memory and Latinity does not\r\npresent itself to her as edifying or graceful.  She does not write books\r\nto confound philosophers, perhaps because she is able to write books that\r\ndelight them.  In conversation she is the least formidable of women,\r\nbecause she understands you, without wanting to make you aware that you\r\n_can’t_ understand her.  She does not give you information, which is the\r\nraw material of culture—she gives you sympathy, which is its subtlest\r\nessence.\r\n\r\nA more numerous class of silly novels than the oracular (which are\r\ngenerally inspired by some form of High Church or transcendental\r\nChristianity) is what we may call the _white neck-cloth_ species, which\r\nrepresent the tone of thought and feeling in the Evangelical party.  This\r\nspecies is a kind of genteel tract on a large scale, intended as a sort\r\nof medicinal sweetmeat for Low Church young ladies; an Evangelical\r\nsubstitute for the fashionable novel, as the May Meetings are a\r\nsubstitute for the Opera.  Even Quaker children, one would think, can\r\nhardly have been denied the indulgence of a doll; but it must be a doll\r\ndressed in a drab gown and a coal-scuttle-bonnet—not a worldly doll, in\r\ngauze and spangles.  And there are no young ladies, we imagine—unless\r\nthey belong to the Church of the United Brethren, in which people are\r\nmarried without any love-making—who can dispense with love stories.\r\nThus, for Evangelical young ladies there are Evangelical love stories, in\r\nwhich the vicissitudes of the tender passion are sanctified by saving\r\nviews of Regeneration and the Atonement.  These novels differ from the\r\noracular ones, as a Low Churchwoman often differs from a High\r\nChurchwoman: they are a little less supercilious and a great deal more\r\nignorant, a little less correct in their syntax and a great deal more\r\nvulgar.\r\n\r\nThe Orlando of Evangelical literature is the young curate, looked at from\r\nthe point of view of the middle class, where cambric bands are understood\r\nto have as thrilling an effect on the hearts of young ladies as\r\nepaulettes have in the classes above and below it.  In the ordinary type\r\nof these novels the hero is almost sure to be a young curate, frowned\r\nupon, perhaps by worldly mammas, but carrying captive the hearts of their\r\ndaughters, who can “never forget _that_ sermon;” tender glances are\r\nseized from the pulpit stairs instead of the opera-box; _tête-à-têtes_\r\nare seasoned with quotations from Scripture instead of quotations from\r\nthe poets; and questions as to the state of the heroine’s affections are\r\nmingled with anxieties as to the state of her soul.  The young curate\r\nalways has a background of well-dressed and wealthy if not fashionable\r\nsociety—for Evangelical silliness is as snobbish as any other kind of\r\nsilliness—and the Evangelical lady novelist, while she explains to you\r\nthe type of the scapegoat on one page, is ambitious on another to\r\nrepresent the manners and conversations of aristocratic people.  Her\r\npictures of fashionable society are often curious studies, considered as\r\nefforts of the Evangelical imagination; but in one particular the novels\r\nof the White Neck-cloth School are meritoriously realistic—their favorite\r\nhero, the Evangelical young curate, is always rather an insipid\r\npersonage.\r\n\r\nThe most recent novel of this species that we happen to have before us is\r\n“The Old Grey Church.”  It is utterly tame and feeble; there is no one\r\nset of objects on which the writer seems to have a stronger grasp than on\r\nany other; and we should be entirely at a loss to conjecture among what\r\nphases of life her experience has been gained, but for certain vulgarisms\r\nof style which sufficiently indicate that she has had the advantage,\r\nthough she has been unable to use it, of mingling chiefly with men and\r\nwomen whose manners and characters have not had all their bosses and\r\nangles rubbed down by refined conventionalism.  It is less excusable in\r\nan Evangelical novelist than in any other, gratuitously to seek her\r\nsubjects among titles and carriages.  The real drama of\r\nEvangelicalism—and it has abundance of fine drama for any one who has\r\ngenius enough to discern and reproduce it—lies among the middle and lower\r\nclasses; and are not Evangelical opinions understood to give an especial\r\ninterest in the weak things of the earth, rather than in the mighty?\r\nWhy, then, cannot our Evangelical lady novelists show us the operation of\r\ntheir religious views among people (there really are many such in the\r\nworld) who keep no carriage, “not so much as a brass-bound gig,” who even\r\nmanage to eat their dinner without a silver fork, and in whose mouths the\r\nauthoress’s questionable English would be strictly consistent?  Why can\r\nwe not have pictures of religious life among the industrial classes in\r\nEngland, as interesting as Mrs. Stowe’s pictures of religious life among\r\nthe negroes?  Instead of this pious ladies nauseate us with novels which\r\nremind us of what we sometimes see in a worldly woman recently\r\n“converted;”—she is as fond of a fine dinner-table as before, but she\r\ninvites clergymen instead of beaux; she thinks as much of her dress as\r\nbefore, but she adopts a more sober choice of colors and patterns; her\r\nconversation is as trivial as before, but the triviality is flavored with\r\ngospel instead of gossip.  In “The Old Grey Church” we have the same sort\r\nof Evangelical travesty of the fashionable novel, and of course the\r\nvicious, intriguing baronet is not wanting.  It is worth while to give a\r\nsample of the style of conversation attributed to this high-born rake—a\r\nstyle that, in its profuse italics and palpable innuendoes, is worthy of\r\nMiss Squeers.  In an evening visit to the ruins of the Colosseum,\r\nEustace, the young clergyman, has been withdrawing the heroine, Miss\r\nLushington, from the rest of the party, for the sake of a _tête-à-tête_.\r\nThe baronet is jealous, and vents his pique in this way:\r\n\r\n    “There they are, and Miss Lushington, no doubt, quite safe; for she\r\n    is under the holy guidance of Pope Eustace the First, who has, of\r\n    course, been delivering to her an edifying homily on the wickedness\r\n    of the heathens of yore, who, as tradition tells us, in this very\r\n    place let loose the wild _beastises_ on poor St. Paul!—Oh, no! by the\r\n    bye, I believe I am wrong, and betraying my want of clergy, and that\r\n    it was not at all St. Paul, nor was it here.  But no matter, it would\r\n    equally serve as a text to preach from, and from which to diverge to\r\n    the degenerate _heathen_ Christians of the present day, and all their\r\n    naughty practices, and so end with an exhortation to ‘come but from\r\n    among them, and be separate;’—and I am sure, Miss Lushington, you\r\n    have most scrupulously conformed to that injunction this evening, for\r\n    we have seen nothing of you since our arrival.  But every one seems\r\n    agreed it has been a _charming party of pleasure_, and I am sure we\r\n    all feel _much indebted_ to Mr. Gray for having _suggested_ it; and\r\n    as he seems so capital a cicerone, I hope he will think of something\r\n    else equally agreeable to _all_.”\r\n\r\nThis drivelling kind of dialogue, and equally drivelling narrative,\r\nwhich, like a bad drawing, represents nothing, and barely indicates what\r\nis meant to be represented, runs through the book; and we have no doubt\r\nis considered by the amiable authoress to constitute an improving novel,\r\nwhich Christian mothers will do well to put into the hands of their\r\ndaughters.  But everything is relative; we have met with American\r\nvegetarians whose normal diet was dry meal, and who, when their appetite\r\nwanted stimulating, tickled it with _wet_ meal; and so, we can imagine\r\nthat there are Evangelical circles in which “The Old Grey Church” is\r\ndevoured as a powerful and interesting fiction.\r\n\r\nBut perhaps the least readable of silly women’s novels are the\r\n_modern-antique_ species, which unfold to us the domestic life of Jannes\r\nand Jambres, the private love affairs of Sennacherib, or the mental\r\nstruggles and ultimate conversion of Demetrius the silversmith.  From\r\nmost silly novels we can at least extract a laugh; but those of the\r\nmodern-antique school have a ponderous, a leaden kind of fatuity, under\r\nwhich we groan.  What can be more demonstrative of the inability of\r\nliterary women to measure their own powers than their frequent assumption\r\nof a task which can only be justified by the rarest concurrence of\r\nacquirement with genius?  The finest effort to reanimate the past is of\r\ncourse only approximative—is always more or less an infusion of the\r\nmodern spirit into the ancient form—\r\n\r\n    Was ihr den Geist der Zeiten heisst,\r\n    Das ist im Grund der Herren eigner Geist,\r\n    In dem die Zeiten sich bespiegeln.\r\n\r\nAdmitting that genius which has familiarized itself with all the relics\r\nof an ancient period can sometimes, by the force of its sympathetic\r\ndivination, restore the missing notes in the “music of humanity,” and\r\nreconstruct the fragments into a whole which will really bring the remote\r\npast nearer to us, and interpret it to our duller apprehension—this form\r\nof imaginative power must always be among the very rarest, because it\r\ndemands as much accurate and minute knowledge as creative vigor.  Yet we\r\nfind ladies constantly choosing to make their mental mediocrity more\r\nconspicuous by clothing it in a masquerade of ancient names; by putting\r\ntheir feeble sentimentality into the mouths of Roman vestals or Egyptian\r\nprincesses, and attributing their rhetorical arguments to Jewish\r\nhigh-priests and Greek philosophers.  A recent example of this heavy\r\nimbecility is “Adonijah, a Tale of the Jewish Dispersion,” which forms\r\npart of a series, “uniting,” we are told, “taste, humor, and sound\r\nprinciples.”  “Adonijah,” we presume, exemplifies the tale of “sound\r\nprinciples;” the taste and humor are to be found in other members of the\r\nseries.  We are told on the cover that the incidents of this tale are\r\n“fraught with unusual interest,” and the preface winds up thus: “To those\r\nwho feel interested in the dispersed of Israel and Judea, these pages may\r\nafford, perhaps, information on an important subject, as well as\r\namusement.”  Since the “important subject” on which this book is to\r\nafford information is not specified, it may possibly lie in some esoteric\r\nmeaning to which we have no key; but if it has relation to the dispersed\r\nof Israel and Judea at any period of their history, we believe a\r\ntolerably well-informed school-girl already knows much more of it than\r\nshe will find in this “Tale of the Jewish Dispersion.”  “Adonijah” is\r\nsimply the feeblest kind of love story, supposed to be instructive, we\r\npresume, because the hero is a Jewish captive and the heroine a Roman\r\nvestal; because they and their friends are converted to Christianity\r\nafter the shortest and easiest method approved by the “Society for\r\nPromoting the Conversion of the Jews;” and because, instead of being\r\nwritten in plain language, it is adorned with that peculiar style of\r\ngrandiloquence which is held by some lady novelists to give an antique\r\ncoloring, and which we recognize at once in such phrases as these:—“the\r\nsplendid regnal talent, undoubtedly, possessed by the Emperor Nero”—“the\r\nexpiring scion of a lofty stem”—“the virtuous partner of his couch”—“ah,\r\nby Vesta!”—and “I tell thee, Roman.”  Among the quotations which serve at\r\nonce for instruction and ornament on the cover of this volume, there is\r\none from Miss Sinclair, which informs us that “Works of imagination are\r\n_avowedly_ read by men of science, wisdom, and piety;” from which we\r\nsuppose the reader is to gather the cheering inference that Dr. Daubeny,\r\nMr. Mill, or Mr. Maurice may openly indulge himself with the perusal of\r\n“Adonijah,” without being obliged to secrete it among the sofa cushions,\r\nor read it by snatches under the dinner-table.\r\n\r\n                                * * * * *\r\n\r\n“Be not a baker if your head be made of butter,” says a homely proverb,\r\nwhich, being interpreted, may mean, let no woman rush into print who is\r\nnot prepared for the consequences.  We are aware that our remarks are in\r\na very different tone from that of the reviewers who, with perennial\r\nrecurrence of precisely similar emotions, only paralleled, we imagine, in\r\nthe experience of monthly nurses, tell one lady novelist after another\r\nthat they “hail” her productions “with delight.”  We are aware that the\r\nladies at whom our criticism is pointed are accustomed to be told, in the\r\nchoicest phraseology of puffery, that their pictures of life are\r\nbrilliant, their characters well drawn, their style fascinating, and\r\ntheir sentiments lofty.  But if they are inclined to resent our plainness\r\nof speech, we ask them to reflect for a moment on the chary praise, and\r\noften captious blame, which their panegyrists give to writers whose works\r\nare on the way to become classics.  No sooner does a woman show that she\r\nhas genius or effective talent, than she receives the tribute of being\r\nmoderately praised and severely criticised.  By a peculiar thermometric\r\nadjustment, when a woman’s talent is at zero, journalistic approbation is\r\nat the boiling pitch; when she attains mediocrity, it is already at no\r\nmore than summer heat; and if ever she reaches excellence, critical\r\nenthusiasm drops to the freezing point.  Harriet Martineau, Currer Bell,\r\nand Mrs. Gaskell have been treated as cavalierly as if they had been men.\r\nAnd every critic who forms a high estimate of the share women may\r\nultimately take in literature, will on principle abstain from any\r\nexceptional indulgence toward the productions of literary women.  For it\r\nmust be plain to every one who looks impartially and extensively into\r\nfeminine literature that its greatest deficiencies are due hardly more to\r\nthe want of intellectual power than to the want of those moral qualities\r\nthat contribute to literary excellence—patient diligence, a sense of the\r\nresponsibility involved in publication, and an appreciation of the\r\nsacredness of the writer’s art.  In the majority of women’s books you see\r\nthat kind of facility which springs from the absence of any high\r\nstandard; that fertility in imbecile combination or feeble imitation\r\nwhich a little self-criticism would check and reduce to barrenness; just\r\nas with a total want of musical ear people will sing out of tune, while a\r\ndegree more melodic sensibility would suffice to render them silent.  The\r\nfoolish vanity of wishing to appear in print, instead of being\r\ncounterbalanced by any consciousness of the intellectual or moral\r\nderogation implied in futile authorship, seems to be encouraged by the\r\nextremely false impression that to write _at all_ is a proof of\r\nsuperiority in a woman.  On this ground we believe that the average\r\nintellect of women is unfairly represented by the mass of feminine\r\nliterature, and that while the few women who write well are very far\r\nabove the ordinary intellectual level of their sex, the many women who\r\nwrite ill are very far below it.  So that, after all, the severer critics\r\nare fulfilling a chivalrous duty in depriving the mere fact of feminine\r\nauthorship of any false prestige which may give it a delusive attraction,\r\nand in recommending women of mediocre faculties—as at least a negative\r\nservice they can render their sex—to abstain from writing.\r\n\r\nThe standing apology for women who become writers without any special\r\nqualification is that society shuts them out from other spheres of\r\noccupation.  Society is a very culpable entity, and has to answer for the\r\nmanufacture of many unwholesome commodities, from bad pickles to bad\r\npoetry.  But society, like “matter,” and Her Majesty’s Government, and\r\nother lofty abstractions, has its share of excessive blame as well as\r\nexcessive praise.  Where there is one woman who writes from necessity, we\r\nbelieve there are three women who write from vanity; and besides, there\r\nis something so antispetic in the mere healthy fact of working for one’s\r\nbread, that the most trashy and rotten kind of feminine literature is not\r\nlikely to have been produced under such circumstances.  “In all labor\r\nthere is profit;” but ladies’ silly novels, we imagine, are less the\r\nresult of labor than of busy idleness.\r\n\r\nHappily, we are not dependent on argument to prove that Fiction is a\r\ndepartment of literature in which women can, after their kind, fully\r\nequal men.  A cluster of great names, both living and dead, rush to our\r\nmemories in evidence that women can produce novels not only fine, but\r\namong the very finest—novels, too, that have a precious speciality, lying\r\nquite apart from masculine aptitudes and experience.  No educational\r\nrestrictions can shut women out from the materials of fiction, and there\r\nis no species of art which is so free from rigid requirements.  Like\r\ncrystalline masses, it may take any form, and yet be beautiful; we have\r\nonly to pour in the right elements—genuine observation, humor, and\r\npassion.  But it is precisely this absence of rigid requirement which\r\nconstitutes the fatal seduction of novel-writing to incompetent women.\r\nLadies are not wont to be very grossly deceived as to their power of\r\nplaying on the piano; here certain positive difficulties of execution\r\nhave to be conquered, and incompetence inevitably breaks down.  Every art\r\nwhich had its absolute _technique_ is, to a certain extent, guarded from\r\nthe intrusions of mere left-handed imbecility.  But in novel-writing\r\nthere are no barriers for incapacity to stumble against, no external\r\ncriteria to prevent a writer from mistaking foolish facility for mastery.\r\nAnd so we have again and again the old story of La Fontaine’s ass, who\r\npats his nose to the flute, and, finding that he elicits some sound,\r\nexclaims, “Moi, aussie, je joue de la flute”—a fable which we commend, at\r\nparting, to the consideration of any feminine reader who is in danger of\r\nadding to the number of “silly novels by lady novelists.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nVII.  WORLDLINESS AND OTHER-WORLDLINESS: THE POET YOUNG. {205}\r\n\r\n\r\nThe study of men, as they have appeared in different ages and under\r\nvarious social conditions, may be considered as the natural history of\r\nthe race.  Let us, then, for a moment imagine ourselves, as students of\r\nthis natural history, “dredging” the first half of the eighteenth century\r\nin search of specimens.  About the year 1730 we have hauled up a\r\nremarkable individual of the species _divine_—a surprising name,\r\nconsidering the nature of the animal before us, but we are used to\r\nunsuitable names in natural history.  Let us examine this individual at\r\nour leisure.  He is on the verge of fifty, and has recently undergone his\r\nmetamorphosis into the clerical form.  Rather a paradoxical specimen, if\r\nyou observe him narrowly: a sort of cross between a sycophant and a\r\npsalmist; a poet whose imagination is alternately fired by the “Last Day”\r\nand by a creation of peers, who fluctuates between rhapsodic applause of\r\nKing George and rhapsodic applause of Jehovah.  After spending “a foolish\r\nyouth, the sport of peers and poets,” after being a hanger-on of the\r\nprofligate Duke of Wharton, after aiming in vain at a parliamentary\r\ncareer, and angling for pensions and preferment with fulsome dedications\r\nand fustian odes, he is a little disgusted with his imperfect success,\r\nand has determined to retire from the general mendicancy business to a\r\nparticular branch; in other words, he has determined on that renunciation\r\nof the world implied in “taking orders,” with the prospect of a good\r\nliving and an advantageous matrimonial connection.  And no man can be\r\nbetter fitted for an Established Church.  He personifies completely her\r\nnice balance of temporalities and spiritualities.  He is equally\r\nimpressed with the momentousness of death and of burial fees; he\r\nlanguishes at once for immortal life and for “livings;” he has a fervid\r\nattachment to patrons in general, but on the whole prefers the Almighty.\r\nHe will teach, with something more than official conviction, the\r\nnothingness of earthly things; and he will feel something more than\r\nprivate disgust if his meritorious efforts in directing men’s attention\r\nto another world are not rewarded by substantial preferment in this.  His\r\nsecular man believes in cambric bands and silk stockings as\r\ncharacteristic attire for “an ornament of religion and virtue;” hopes\r\ncourtiers will never forget to copy Sir Robert Walpole; and writes\r\nbegging letters to the King’s mistress.  His spiritual man recognizes no\r\nmotives more familiar than Golgotha and “the skies;” it walks in\r\ngraveyards, or it soars among the stars.  His religion exhausts itself in\r\nejaculations and rebukes, and knows no medium between the ecstatic and\r\nthe sententious.  If it were not for the prospect of immortality, he\r\nconsiders, it would be wise and agreeable to be indecent or to murder\r\none’s father; and, heaven apart, it would be extremely irrational in any\r\nman not to be a knave.  Man, he thinks, is a compound of the angel and\r\nthe brute; the brute is to be humbled by being reminded of its “relation\r\nto the stalls,” and frightened into moderation by the contemplation of\r\ndeath-beds and skulls; the angel is to be developed by vituperating this\r\nworld and exalting the next; and by this double process you get the\r\nChristian—“the highest style of man.”  With all this, our new-made divine\r\nis an unmistakable poet.  To a clay compounded chiefly of the worldling\r\nand the rhetorician, there is added a real spark of Promethean fire.  He\r\nwill one day clothe his apostrophes and objurgations, his astronomical\r\nreligion and his charnel-house morality, in lasting verse, which will\r\nstand, like a Juggernaut made of gold and jewels, at once magnificent and\r\nrepulsive: for this divine is Edward Young, the future author of the\r\n“Night Thoughts.”\r\n\r\nIt would be extremely ill-bred in us to suppose that our readers are not\r\nacquainted with the facts of Young’s life; they are among the things that\r\n“every one knows;” but we have observed that, with regard to these\r\nuniversally known matters, the majority of readers like to be treated\r\nafter the plan suggested by Monsieur Jourdain.  When that distinguished\r\n_bourgeois_ was asked if he knew Latin, he implied, “Oui, mais faîtes\r\ncomme si je ne le savais pas.”  Assuming, then, as a polite writer\r\nshould, that our readers know everything about Young, it will be a direct\r\n_sequitur_ from that assumption that we should proceed as if they knew\r\nnothing, and recall the incidents of his biography with as much\r\nparticularity as we may without trenching on the space we shall need for\r\nour main purpose—the reconsideration of his character as a moral and\r\nreligious poet.\r\n\r\nJudging from Young’s works, one might imagine that the preacher had been\r\norganized in him by hereditary transmission through a long line of\r\nclerical forefathers—that the diamonds of the “Night Thoughts” had been\r\nslowly condensed from the charcoal of ancestral sermons.  Yet it was not\r\nso.  His grandfather, apparently, wrote himself _gentleman_, not _clerk_;\r\nand there is no evidence that preaching had run in the family blood\r\nbefore it took that turn in the person of the poet’s father, who was\r\nquadruply clerical, being at once rector, prebendary, court chaplain, and\r\ndean.  Young was born at his father’s rectory of Upham in 1681.  We may\r\nconfidently assume that even the author of the “Night Thoughts” came into\r\nthe world without a wig; but, apart from Dr. Doran’s authority, we should\r\nnot have ventured to state that the excellent rector “kissed, _with\r\ndignified emotion_, his only son and intended namesake.”  Dr. Doran\r\ndoubtless knows this, from his intimate acquaintance with clerical\r\nphysiology and psychology.  He has ascertained that the paternal emotions\r\nof prebendaries have a sacerdotal quality, and that the very chyme and\r\nchyle of a rector are conscious of the gown and band.\r\n\r\nIn due time the boy went to Winchester College, and subsequently, though\r\nnot till he was twenty-two, to Oxford, where, for his father’s sake, he\r\nwas befriended by the wardens of two colleges, and in 1708, three years\r\nafter his father’s death, nominated by Archbishop Tenison to a law\r\nfellowship at All Souls.  Of Young’s life at Oxford in these years,\r\nhardly anything is known.  His biographer, Croft, has nothing to tell us\r\nbut the vague report that, when “Young found himself independent and his\r\nown master at All Souls, he was not the ornament to religion and morality\r\nthat he afterward became,” and the perhaps apocryphal anecdote, that\r\nTindal, the atheist, confessed himself embarrassed by the originality of\r\nYoung’s arguments.  Both the report and the anecdote, however, are borne\r\nout by indirect evidence.  As to the latter, Young has left us sufficient\r\nproof that he was fond of arguing on the theological side, and that he\r\nhad his own way of treating old subjects.  As to the former, we learn\r\nthat Pope, after saying other things which we know to be true of Young,\r\nadded, that he passed “a foolish youth, the sport of peers and poets;”\r\nand, from all the indications we possess of his career till he was nearly\r\nfifty, we are inclined to think that Pope’s statement only errs by\r\ndefect, and that he should rather have said, “a foolish youth and\r\n_middle_ age.”  It is not likely that Young was a very hard student, for\r\nhe impressed Johnson, who saw him in his old age, as “not a great\r\nscholar,” and as surprisingly ignorant of what Johnson thought “quite\r\ncommon maxims” in literature; and there is no evidence that he filled\r\neither his leisure or his purse by taking pupils.  His career as an\r\nauthor did not commence till he was nearly thirty, even dating from the\r\npublication of a portion of the “Last Day,” in the _Tatler_; so that he\r\ncould hardly have been absorbed in composition.  But where the fully\r\ndeveloped insect is parasitic, we believe the larva is usually parasitic\r\nalso, and we shall probably not be far wrong in supposing that Young at\r\nOxford, as elsewhere, spent a good deal of his time in hanging about\r\npossible and actual patrons, and accommodating himself to the habits with\r\nconsiderable flexibility of conscience and of tongue; being none the less\r\nready, upon occasion, to present himself as the champion of theology and\r\nto rhapsodize at convenient moments in the company of the skies or of\r\nskulls.  That brilliant profligate, the Duke of Wharton, to whom Young\r\nafterward clung as his chief patron, was at this time a mere boy; and,\r\nthough it is probable that their intimacy had commenced, since the Duke’s\r\nfather and mother were friends of the old dean, that intimacy ought not\r\nto aggravate any unfavorable inference as to Young’s Oxford life.  It is\r\nless likely that he fell into any exceptional vice than that he differed\r\nfrom the men around him chiefly in his episodes of theological advocacy\r\nand rhapsodic solemnity.  He probably sowed his wild oats after the\r\ncoarse fashion of his times, for he has left us sufficient evidence that\r\nhis moral sense was not delicate; but his companions, who were occupied\r\nin sowing their own oats, perhaps took it as a matter of course that he\r\nshould be a rake, and were only struck with the exceptional circumstance\r\nthat he was a pious and moralizing rake.\r\n\r\nThere is some irony in the fact that the two first poetical productions\r\nof Young, published in the same year, were his “Epistles to Lord\r\nLansdowne,” celebrating the recent creation of peers—Lord Lansdowne’s\r\ncreation in particular; and the “Last Day.”  Other poets besides Young\r\nfound the device for obtaining a Tory majority by turning twelve\r\ninsignificant commoners into insignificant lords, an irresistible\r\nstimulus to verse; but no other poet showed so versatile an enthusiasm—so\r\nnearly equal an ardor for the honor of the new baron and the honor of the\r\nDeity.  But the twofold nature of the sycophant and the psalmist is not\r\nmore strikingly shown in the contrasted themes of the two poems than in\r\nthe transitions from bombast about monarchs to bombast about the\r\nresurrection, in the “Last Day” itself.  The dedication of the poem to\r\nQueen Anne, Young afterward suppressed, for he was always ashamed of\r\nhaving flattered a dead patron.  In this dedication, Croft tells us, “he\r\ngives her Majesty praise indeed for her victories, but says that the\r\nauthor is more pleased to see her rise from this lower world, soaring\r\nabove the clouds, passing the first and second heavens, and leaving the\r\nfixed stars behind her; nor will he lose her there, he says, but keep her\r\nstill in view through the boundless spaces on the other side of creation,\r\nin her journey toward eternal bliss, till he behold the heaven of heavens\r\nopen, and angels receiving and conveying her still onward from the\r\nstretch of his imagination, which tires in her pursuit, and falls back\r\nagain to earth.”\r\n\r\nThe self-criticism which prompted the suppression of the dedication did\r\nnot, however, lead him to improve either the rhyme or the reason of the\r\nunfortunate couplet—\r\n\r\n    “When other Bourbons reign in other lands,\r\n    And, if men’s sins forbid not, other Annes.”\r\n\r\nIn the “Epistle to Lord Lansdowne” Young indicates his taste for the\r\ndrama; and there is evidence that his tragedy of “Busiris” was “in the\r\ntheatre” as early as this very year, 1713, though it was not brought on\r\nthe stage till nearly six years later; so that Young was now very\r\ndecidedly bent on authorship, for which his degree of B.C.L., taken in\r\nthis year, was doubtless a magical equipment.  Another poem, “The Force\r\nof Religion; or, Vanquished Love,” founded on the execution of Lady Jane\r\nGrey and her husband, quickly followed, showing fertility in feeble and\r\ntasteless verse; and on the Queen’s death, in 1714, Young lost no time in\r\nmaking a poetical lament for a departed patron a vehicle for extravagant\r\nlaudation of the new monarch.  No further literary production of his\r\nappeared until 1716, when a Latin oration, which he delivered on the\r\nfoundation of the Codrington Library at All Souls, gave him a new\r\nopportunity for displaying his alacrity in inflated panegyric.\r\n\r\nIn 1717 it is probable that Young accompanied the Duke of Wharton to\r\nIreland, though so slender are the materials for his biography that the\r\nchief basis for this supposition is a passage in his “Conjectures on\r\nOriginal Composition,” written when he was nearly eighty, in which he\r\nintimates that he had once been in that country.  But there are many\r\nfacts surviving to indicate that for the next eight or nine years Young\r\nwas a sort of _attaché_ of Wharton’s.  In 1719, according to legal\r\nrecords, the Duke granted him an annuity, in consideration of his having\r\nrelinquished the office of tutor to Lord Burleigh, with a life annuity of\r\n£100 a year, on his Grace’s assurances that he would provide for him in a\r\nmuch more ample manner.  And again, from the same evidence, it appears\r\nthat in 1721 Young received from Wharton a bond for £600, in compensation\r\nof expenses incurred in standing for Parliament at the Duke’s desire, and\r\nas an earnest of greater services which his Grace had promised him on his\r\nrefraining from the spiritual and temporal advantages of taking orders,\r\nwith a certainty of two livings in the gift of his college.  It is clear,\r\ntherefore, that lay advancement, as long as there was any chance of it,\r\nhad more attractions for Young than clerical preferment; and that at this\r\ntime he accepted the Duke of Wharton as the pilot of his career.\r\n\r\nA more creditable relation of Young’s was his friendship with Tickell,\r\nwith whom he was in the habit of interchanging criticisms, and to whom in\r\n1719—the same year, let us note, in which he took his doctor’s degree—he\r\naddressed his “Lines on the Death of Addison.”  Close upon these followed\r\nhis “Paraphrase of part of the Book of Job,” with a dedication to Parker,\r\nrecently made Lord Chancellor, showing that the possession of Wharton’s\r\npatronage did not prevent Young from fishing in other waters.  He knew\r\nnothing of Parker, but that did not prevent him from magnifying the new\r\nChancellor’s merits; on the other hand, he _did_ know Wharton, but this\r\nagain did not prevent him from prefixing to his tragedy, “The Revenge,”\r\nwhich appeared in 1721, a dedication attributing to the Duke all virtues,\r\nas well as all accomplishments.  In the concluding sentence of this\r\ndedication, Young naïvely indicates that a considerable ingredient in his\r\ngratitude was a lively sense of anticipated favors.  “My present fortune\r\nis his bounty, and my future his care; which I will venture to say will\r\nalways be remembered to his honor; since he, I know, intended his\r\ngenerosity as an encouragement to merit, through his very pardonable\r\npartiality to one who bears him so sincere a duty and respect, I happen\r\nto receive the benefit of it.”  Young was economical with his ideas and\r\nimages; he was rarely satisfied with using a clever thing once, and this\r\nbit of ingenious humility was afterward made to do duty in the\r\n“Instalment,” a poem addressed to Walpole:\r\n\r\n    “Be this thy partial smile, from censure free,\r\n    ’Twas meant for merit, though it fell on me.”\r\n\r\nIt was probably “The Revenge” that Young was writing when, as we learn\r\nfrom Spence’s anecdotes, the Duke of Wharton gave him a skull with a\r\ncandle fixed in it, as the most appropriate lamp by which to write\r\ntragedy.  According to Young’s dedication, the Duke was “accessory” to\r\nthe scenes of this tragedy in a more important way, “not only by\r\nsuggesting the most beautiful incident in them, but by making all\r\npossible provision for the success of the whole.”  A statement which is\r\ncredible, not indeed on the ground of Young’s dedicatory assertion, but\r\nfrom the known ability of the Duke, who, as Pope tells us, possessed\r\n\r\n          “each gift of Nature and of Art,\r\n    And wanted nothing but an honest heart.”\r\n\r\nThe year 1722 seems to have been the period of a visit to Mr. Dodington,\r\nof Eastbury, in Dorsetshire—the “pure Dorsetian downs” celebrated by\r\nThomson—in which Young made the acquaintance of Voltaire; for in the\r\nsubsequent dedication of his “Sea Piece” to “Mr. Voltaire,” he recalls\r\ntheir meeting on “Dorset Downs;” and it was in this year that Christopher\r\nPitt, a gentleman-poet of those days, addressed an “Epistle to Dr. Edward\r\nYoung, at Eastbury, in Dorsetshire,” which has at least the merit of this\r\nbiographical couplet:\r\n\r\n    “While with your Dodington retired you sit,\r\n    Charm’d with his flowing Burgundy and wit.”\r\n\r\nDodington, apparently, was charmed in his turn, for he told Dr. Wharton\r\nthat Young was “far superior to the French poet in the variety and\r\nnovelty of his _bon-mots_ and repartees.”  Unfortunately, the only\r\nspecimen of Young’s wit on this occasion that has been preserved to us is\r\nthe epigram represented as an extempore retort (spoken aside, surely) to\r\nVoltaire’s criticism of Milton’s episode of sin and death:\r\n\r\n    “Thou art so witty, profligate, and thin,\r\n    At once, we think thee Milton, Death, and Sin;”—\r\n\r\nan epigram which, in the absence of “flowing Burgundy,” does not strike\r\nus as remarkably brilliant.  Let us give Young the benefit of the doubt\r\nthrown on the genuineness of this epigram by his own poetical dedication,\r\nin which he represents himself as having “soothed” Voltaire’s “rage”\r\nagainst Milton “with gentle rhymes;” though in other respects that\r\ndedication is anything but favorable to a high estimate of Young’s wit.\r\nOther evidence apart, we should not be eager for the after-dinner\r\nconversation of the man who wrote:\r\n\r\n    “Thine is the Drama, how renown’d!\r\n    Thine Epic’s loftier trump to sound;—\r\n    _But let Arion’s sea-strung harp be mine_;\r\n    _But where’s his dolphin_?  _Know’st thou where_?\r\n    _May that be found in thee_, _Voltaire_!”\r\n\r\nThe “Satires” appeared in 1725 and 1726, each, of course, with its\r\nlaudatory dedication and its compliments insinuated among the rhymes.\r\nThe seventh and last is dedicated to Sir Robert Walpole, is very short,\r\nand contains nothing in particular except lunatic flattery of George the\r\nFirst and his prime minister, attributing that royal hog’s late escape\r\nfrom a storm at sea to the miraculous influence of his grand and virtuous\r\nsoul—for George, he says, rivals the angels:\r\n\r\n    “George, who in foes can soft affections raise,\r\n    And charm envenom’d satire into praise.\r\n    Nor human rage alone his pow’r perceives,\r\n    But the mad winds and the tumultuous waves,\r\n    Ev’n storms (Death’s fiercest ministers!) forbear,\r\n    And in their own wild empire learn to spare.\r\n    Thus, Nature’s self, supporting Man’s decree,\r\n    Styles Britain’s sovereign, sovereign of the sea.”\r\n\r\nAs for Walpole, what _he_ felt at this tremendous crisis\r\n\r\n    “No powers of language, but his own, can tell,\r\n    His own, which Nature and the Graces form,\r\n    At will, to raise, or hush, the civil storm.”\r\n\r\nIt is a coincidence worth noticing, that this seventh Satire was\r\npublished in 1726, and that the warrant of George the First, granting\r\nYoung a pension of £200 a year from Lady-day, 1725, is dated May 3d,\r\n1726.  The gratitude exhibited in this Satire may have been chiefly\r\nprospective, but the “Instalment,” a poem inspired by the thrilling event\r\nof Walpole’s installation as Knight of the Garter, was clearly written\r\nwith the double ardor of a man who has got a pension and hopes for\r\nsomething more.  His emotion about Walpole is precisely at the same pitch\r\nas his subsequent emotion about the Second Advent.  In the “Instalment”\r\nhe says:\r\n\r\n    “With invocations some their hearts inflame;\r\n    _I need no muse_, _a Walpole is my theme_.”\r\n\r\nAnd of God coming to judgment, he says, in the “Night Thoughts:”\r\n\r\n    “I find my inspiration is my theme;\r\n    _The grandeur of my subject is my muse_.”\r\n\r\nNothing can be feebler than this “Instalment,” except in the strength of\r\nimpudence with which the writer professes to scorn the prostitution of\r\nfair fame, the “profanation of celestial fire.”\r\n\r\nHerbert Croft tells us that Young made more than three thousand pounds by\r\nhis “Satires”—a surprising statement, taken in connection with the\r\nreasonable doubt he throws on the story related in Spence’s “Anecdotes,”\r\nthat the Duke of Wharton gave Young £2000 for this work.  Young, however,\r\nseems to have been tolerably fortunate in the pecuniary results of his\r\npublications; and, with his literary profits, his annuity from Wharton,\r\nhis fellowship, and his pension, not to mention other bounties which may\r\nbe inferred from the high merits he discovers in many men of wealth and\r\nposition, we may fairly suppose that he now laid the foundation of the\r\nconsiderable fortune he left at his death.\r\n\r\nIt is probable that the Duke of Wharton’s final departure for the\r\nContinent and disgrace at Court in 1726, and the consequent cessation of\r\nYoung’s reliance on his patronage, tended not only to heighten the\r\ntemperature of his poetical enthusiasm for Sir Robert Walpole, but also\r\nto turn his thoughts toward the Church again, as the second-best means of\r\nrising in the world.  On the accession of George the Second, Young found\r\nthe same transcendent merits in him as in his predecessor, and celebrated\r\nthem in a style of poetry previously unattempted by him—the Pindaric ode,\r\na poetic form which helped him to surpass himself in furious bombast.\r\n“Ocean, an Ode: concluding with a Wish,” was the title of this piece.  He\r\nafterward pruned it, and cut off, among other things, the concluding\r\nWish, expressing the yearning for humble retirement, which, of course,\r\nhad prompted him to the effusion; but we may judge of the rejected\r\nstanzas by the quality of those he has allowed to remain.  For example,\r\ncalling on Britain’s dead mariners to rise and meet their “country’s\r\nfull-blown glory” in the person of the new King, he says:\r\n\r\n          “What powerful charm\r\n          Can Death disarm?\r\n    Your long, your iron slumbers break?\r\n          _By Jove_, _by Fame_,\r\n          _By George’s name_,\r\n    Awake! awake! awake! awake!”\r\n\r\nSoon after this notable production, which was written with the ripe folly\r\nof forty-seven, Young took orders, and was presently appointed chaplain\r\nto the King.  “The Brothers,” his third and last tragedy, which was\r\nalready in rehearsal, he now withdrew from the stage, and sought\r\nreputation in a way more accordant with the decorum of his new\r\nprofession, by turning prose writer.  But after publishing “A True\r\nEstimate of Human Life,” with a dedication to the Queen, as one of the\r\n“most shining representatives” of God on earth, and a sermon, entitled\r\n“An Apology for Princes; or, the Reverence due to Government,” preached\r\nbefore the House of Commons, his Pindaric ambition again seized him, and\r\nhe matched his former ode by another, called “Imperium Pelagi, a Naval\r\nLyric; written in imitation of Pindar’s spirit, occasioned by his\r\nMajesty’s return from Hanover, 1729, and the succeeding Peace.”  Since he\r\nafterward suppressed this second ode, we must suppose that it was rather\r\nworse than the first.  Next came his two “Epistles to Pope, concerning\r\nthe Authors of the Age,” remarkable for nothing but the audacity of\r\naffectation with which the most servile of poets professes to despise\r\nservility.\r\n\r\nIn 1730 Young was presented by his college with the rectory of Welwyn, in\r\nHertfordshire, and, in the following year, when he was just fifty, he\r\nmarried Lady Elizabeth Lee, a widow with two children, who seems to have\r\nbeen in favor with Queen Caroline, and who probably had an income—two\r\nattractions which doubtless enhanced the power of her other charms.\r\nPastoral duties and domesticity probably cured Young of some bad habits;\r\nbut, unhappily, they did not cure him either of flattery or of fustian.\r\nThree more odes followed, quite as bad as those of his bachelorhood,\r\nexcept that in the third he announced the wise resolution of never\r\nwriting another.  It must have been about this time, since Young was now\r\n“turned of fifty,” that he wrote the letter to Mrs. Howard (afterward\r\nLady Suffolk), George the Second’s mistress, which proves that he used\r\nother engines, besides Pindaric ones, in “besieging Court favor.”  The\r\nletter is too characteristic to be omitted:\r\n\r\n                                                          “Monday Morning.\r\n\r\n    “MADAM: I know his Majesty’s goodness to his servants, and his love\r\n    of justice in general, so well, that I am confident, if his Majesty\r\n    knew my case, I should not have any cause to despair of his gracious\r\n    favor to me.\r\n\r\n    “Abilities.         Want.\r\n\r\n    Good Manners.       Sufferings       }\r\n\r\n    Service.            and              } for his\r\n                                         Majesty.\r\n\r\n    Age.                Zeal             }\r\n\r\n    _These_, madam, are the proper points of consideration in the person\r\n    that humbly hopes his Majesty’s favor.\r\n\r\n    “As to _Abilities_, all I can presume to say is, I have done the best\r\n    I could to improve them.\r\n\r\n    “As to _Good manners_, I desire no favor, if any just objection lies\r\n    against them.\r\n\r\n    “As for _Service_, I have been near seven years in his Majesty’s and\r\n    never omitted any duty in it, which few can say.\r\n\r\n    “As for _Age_, I am turned of fifty.\r\n\r\n    “As for _Want_, I have no manner of preferment.\r\n\r\n    “As for _Sufferings_, I have lost £300 per ann. by being in his\r\n    Majesty’s service; as I have shown in a _Representation_ which his\r\n    Majesty has been so good as to read and consider.\r\n\r\n    “As for _Zeal_, I have written nothing without showing my duty to\r\n    their Majesties, and some pieces are dedicated to them.\r\n\r\n    “This, madam, is the short and true state of my case.  They that make\r\n    their court to the ministers, and not their Majesties, succeed\r\n    better.  If my case deserves some consideration, and you can serve me\r\n    in it, I humbly hope and believe you will: I shall, therefore,\r\n    trouble you no farther; but beg leave to subscribe myself, with\r\n    truest respect and gratitude,\r\n\r\n                                                             “Yours, etc.,\r\n                                                             EDWARD YOUNG.\r\n\r\n    “P.S.  I have some hope that my Lord Townshend is my friend; if\r\n    therefore soon, and before he leaves the court, you had an\r\n    opportunity of mentioning me, with that favor you have been so good\r\n    to show, I think it would not fail of success; and, if not, I shall\r\n    owe you more than any.”—“Suffolk Letters,” vol. i. p. 285.\r\n\r\nYoung’s wife died in 1741, leaving him one son, born in 1733.  That he\r\nhad attached himself strongly to her two daughters by her former\r\nmarriage, there is better evidence in the report, mentioned by Mrs.\r\nMontagu, of his practical kindness and liberality to the younger, than in\r\nhis lamentations over the elder as the “Narcissa” of the “Night\r\nThoughts.”  “Narcissa” had died in 1735, shortly after marriage to Mr.\r\nTemple, the son of Lord Palmerston; and Mr. Temple himself, after a\r\nsecond marriage, died in 1740, a year before Lady Elizabeth Young.\r\nThese, then, are the three deaths supposed to have inspired “The\r\nComplaint,” which forms the three first books of the “Night Thoughts:”\r\n\r\n    “Insatiate archer, could not one suffice?\r\n    Thy shaft flew thrice: and thrice my peace was slain:\r\n    And thrice, ere thrice yon moon had fill’d her horn.”\r\n\r\nSince we find Young departing from the truth of dates, in order to\r\nheighten the effect of his calamity, or at least of his climax, we need\r\nnot be surprised that he allowed his imagination great freedom in other\r\nmatters besides chronology, and that the character of “Philander” can, by\r\nno process, be made to fit Mr. Temple.  The supposition that the\r\nmuch-lectured “Lorenzo” of the “Night Thoughts” was Young’s own son is\r\nhardly rendered more absurd by the fact that the poem was written when\r\nthat son was a boy, than by the obvious artificiality of the characters\r\nYoung introduces as targets for his arguments and rebukes.  Among all the\r\ntrivial efforts of conjectured criticism, there can hardly be one more\r\nfutile than the attempts to discover the original of those pitiable\r\nlay-figures, the “Lorenzos” and “Altamonts” of Young’s didactic prose and\r\npoetry.  His muse never stood face to face with a genuine living human\r\nbeing; she would have been as much startled by such an encounter as a\r\nnecromancer whose incantations and blue fire had actually conjured up a\r\ndemon.\r\n\r\nThe “Night Thoughts” appeared between 1741 and 1745.  Although he\r\ndeclares in them that he has chosen God for his “patron” henceforth, this\r\nis not at all to the prejudice of some half dozen lords, duchesses, and\r\nright honorables who have the privilege of sharing finely-turned\r\ncompliments with their co-patron.  The line which closed the Second Night\r\nin the earlier editions—\r\n\r\n    “Wits spare not Heaven, O Wilmington!—nor thee”—\r\n\r\nis an intense specimen of that perilous juxtaposition of ideas by which\r\nYoung, in his incessant search after point and novelty, unconsciously\r\nconverts his compliments into sarcasms; and his apostrophe to the moon as\r\nmore likely to be favorable to his song if he calls her “fair Portland of\r\nthe skies,” is worthy even of his Pindaric ravings.  His ostentatious\r\nrenunciation of worldly schemes, and especially of his twenty-years’\r\nsiege of Court favor, are in the tone of one who retains some hope in the\r\nmidst of his querulousness.\r\n\r\nHe descended from the astronomical rhapsodies of his “Ninth Night,”\r\npublished in 1745, to more terrestrial strains in his “Reflections on the\r\nPublic Situation of the Kingdom,” dedicated to the Duke of Newcastle; but\r\nin this critical year we get a glimpse of him through a more prosaic and\r\nless refracting medium.  He spent a part of the year at Tunbridge Wells;\r\nand Mrs. Montagu, who was there too, gives a very lively picture of the\r\n“divine Doctor” in her letters to the Duchess of Portland, on whom Young\r\nhad bestowed the superlative bombast to which we have recently alluded.\r\nWe shall borrow the quotations from Dr. Doran, in spite of their length,\r\nbecause, to our mind, they present the most agreeable portrait we possess\r\nof Young:\r\n\r\n    “I have great joy in Dr. Young, whom I disturbed in a reverie.  At\r\n    first he started, then bowed, then fell back into a surprise; then\r\n    began a speech, relapsed into his astonishment two or three times,\r\n    forgot what he had been saying; began a new subject, and so went on.\r\n    I told him your grace desired he would write longer letters; to which\r\n    he cried ‘Ha!’ most emphatically, and I leave you to interpret what\r\n    it meant.  He has made a friendship with one person here, whom I\r\n    believe you would not imagine to have been made for his bosom friend.\r\n    You would, perhaps, suppose it was a bishop or dean, a prebend, a\r\n    pious preacher, a clergyman of exemplary life, or, if a layman, of\r\n    most virtuous conversation, one that had paraphrased St. Matthew, or\r\n    wrote comments on St. Paul. . . . You would not guess that this\r\n    associate of the doctor’s was—old Cibber!  Certainly, in their\r\n    religious, moral, and civil character, there is no relation; but in\r\n    their dramatic capacity there is some.—Mrs. Montagu was not aware\r\n    that Cibber, whom Young had named not disparagingly in his Satires,\r\n    was the brother of his old school-fellow; but to return to our hero.\r\n    ‘The waters,’ says Mrs. Montagu, ‘have raised his spirits to a fine\r\n    pitch, as your grace will imagine, when I tell you how sublime an\r\n    answer he made to a very vulgar question.  I asked him how long he\r\n    stayed at the Wells; he said, ‘As long as my rival stayed;—as long as\r\n    the sun did.’  Among the visitors at the Wells were Lady Sunderland\r\n    (wife of Sir Robert Sutton), and her sister, Mrs. Tichborne.  ‘He did\r\n    an admirable thing to Lady Sunderland: on her mentioning Sir Robert\r\n    Sutton, he asked her where Sir Robert’s lady was; on which we all\r\n    laughed very heartily, and I brought him off, half ashamed, to my\r\n    lodgings, where, during breakfast, he assured me he had asked after\r\n    Lady Sunderland, because he had a great honor for her; and that,\r\n    having a respect for her sister, he designed to have inquired after\r\n    her, if we had not put it out of his head by laughing at him.  You\r\n    must know, Mrs. Tichborne sat next to Lady Sunderland.  It would have\r\n    been admirable to have had him finish his compliment in that manner.’\r\n    . . . ‘His expressions all bear the stamp of novelty, and his\r\n    thoughts of sterling sense.  He practises a kind of philosophical\r\n    abstinence. . . . He carried Mrs. Rolt and myself to Tunbridge, five\r\n    miles from hence, where we were to see some fine old ruins.  First\r\n    rode the doctor on a tall steed, decently caparisoned in dark gray;\r\n    next, ambled Mrs. Rolt on a hackney horse; . . . then followed your\r\n    humble servant on a milk-white palfrey.  I rode on in safety, and at\r\n    leisure to observe the company, especially the two figures that\r\n    brought up the rear.  The first was my servant, valiantly armed with\r\n    two uncharged pistols; the last was the doctor’s man, whose uncombed\r\n    hair so resembled the mane of the horse he rode, one could not help\r\n    imagining they were of kin, and wishing, for the honor of the family,\r\n    that they had had one comb betwixt them.  On his head was a velvet\r\n    cap, much resembling a black saucepan, and on his side hung a little\r\n    basket.  At last we arrived at the King’s Head, where the loyalty of\r\n    the doctor induced him to alight; and then, knight-errant-like, he\r\n    took his damsels from off their palfreys, and courteously handed us\r\n    into the inn.’ . . . The party returned to the Wells; and ‘the silver\r\n    Cynthia held up her lamp in the heavens’ the while.  ‘The night\r\n    silenced all but our divine doctor, who sometimes uttered things fit\r\n    to be spoken in a season when all nature seems to be hushed and\r\n    hearkening.  I followed, gathering wisdom as I went, till I found, by\r\n    my horse’s stumbling, that I was in a bad road, and that the blind\r\n    was leading the blind.  So I placed my servant between the doctor and\r\n    myself; which he not perceiving, went on in a most philosophical\r\n    strain, to the great admiration of my poor clown of a servant, who,\r\n    not being wrought up to any pitch of enthusiasm, nor making any\r\n    answer to all the fine things he heard, the doctor, wondering I was\r\n    dumb, and grieving I was so stupid, looked round and declared his\r\n    surprise.’”\r\n\r\nYoung’s oddity and absence of mind are gathered from other sources\r\nbesides these stories of Mrs. Montagu’s, and gave rise to the report that\r\nhe was the original of Fielding’s “Parson Adams;” but this Croft denies,\r\nand mentions another Young, who really sat for the portrait, and who, we\r\nimagine, had both more Greek and more genuine simplicity than the poet.\r\nHis love of chatting with Colley Cibber was an indication that the old\r\npredilection for the stage survived, in spite of his emphatic contempt\r\nfor “all joys but joys that never can expire;” and the production of “The\r\nBrothers,” at Drury Lane in 1753, after a suppression of fifteen years,\r\nwas perhaps not entirely due to the expressed desire to give the proceeds\r\nto the Society for the Propagation of the Gospel.  The author’s profits\r\nwere not more than £400—in those days a disappointing sum; and Young, as\r\nwe learn from his friend Richardson, did not make this the limit of his\r\ndonation, but gave a thousand guineas to the Society.  “I had some talk\r\nwith him,” says Richardson, in one of his letters, “about this great\r\naction.  ‘I always,’ said he, ‘intended to do something handsome for the\r\nSociety.  Had I deferred it to my demise, I should have given away my\r\nson’s money.  All the world are inclined to pleasure; could I have given\r\nmyself a greater by disposing of the sum to a different use, I should\r\nhave done it.’”  Surely he took his old friend Richardson for “Lorenzo!”\r\n\r\nHis next work was “The Centaur not Fabulous; in Six Letters to a Friend,\r\non the Life in Vogue,” which reads very much like the most objurgatory\r\nparts of the “Night Thoughts” reduced to prose.  It is preceded by a\r\npreface which, though addressed to a lady, is in its denunciations of\r\nvice as grossly indecent and almost as flippant as the epilogues written\r\nby “friends,” which he allowed to be reprinted after his tragedies in the\r\nlatest edition of his works.  We like much better than “The Centaur,”\r\n“Conjectures on Original Composition,” written in 1759, for the sake, he\r\nsays, of communicating to the world the well-known anecdote about\r\nAddison’s deathbed, and with the exception of his poem on Resignation,\r\nthe last thing he ever published.\r\n\r\nThe estrangement from his son, which must have embittered the later years\r\nof his life, appears to have begun not many years after the mother’s\r\ndeath.  On the marriage of her second daughter, who had previously\r\npresided over Young’s household, a Mrs. Hallows, understood to be a woman\r\nof discreet age, and the daughter (a widow) of a clergyman who was an old\r\nfriend of Young’s, became housekeeper at Welwyn.  Opinions about ladies\r\nare apt to differ.  “Mrs. Hallows was a woman of piety, improved by\r\nreading,” says one witness.  “She was a very coarse woman,” says Dr.\r\nJohnson; and we shall presently find some indirect evidence that her\r\ntemper was perhaps not quite so much improved as her piety.  Servants, it\r\nseems, were not fond of remaining long in the house with her; a satirical\r\ncurate, named Kidgell, hints at “drops of juniper” taken as a cordial\r\n(but perhaps he was spiteful, and a teetotaller); and Young’s son is said\r\nto have told his father that “an old man should not resign himself to the\r\nmanagement of anybody.”  The result was, that the son was banished from\r\nhome for the rest of his father’s life-time, though Young seems never to\r\nhave thought of disinheriting him.\r\n\r\nOur latest glimpses of the aged poet are derived from certain letters of\r\nMr. Jones, his curate—letters preserved in the British Museum, and\r\nhappily made accessible to common mortals in Nichols’s “Anecdotes.”  Mr.\r\nJones was a man of some literary activity and ambition—a collector of\r\ninteresting documents, and one of those concerned in the “Free and Candid\r\nDisquisitions,” the design of which was “to point out such things in our\r\necclesiastical establishment as want to be reviewed and amended.”  On\r\nthese and kindred subjects he corresponded with Dr. Birch, occasionally\r\ntroubling him with queries and manuscripts.  We have a respect for Mr.\r\nJones.  Unlike any person who ever troubled _us_ with queries or\r\nmanuscripts, he mitigates the infliction by such gifts as “a fat pullet,”\r\nwishing he “had anything better to send; but this depauperizing vicarage\r\n(of Alconbury) too often checks the freedom and forwardness of my mind.”\r\nAnother day comes a “pound canister of tea,” another, a “young fatted\r\ngoose.”  Clearly, Mr. Jones was entirely unlike your literary\r\ncorrespondents of the present day; he forwarded manuscripts, but he had\r\n“bowels,” and forwarded poultry too.  His first letter from Welwyn is\r\ndated June, 1759, not quite six years before Young’s death.  In June,\r\n1762, he expresses a wish to go to London “this summer.  But,” he\r\ncontinues:\r\n\r\n    “My time and pains are almost continually taken up here, and . . . I\r\n    have been (I now find) a considerable loser, upon the whole, by\r\n    continuing here so long.  The consideration of this, and the\r\n    inconveniences I sustained, and do still experience, from my late\r\n    illness, obliged me at last to acquaint the Doctor (Young) with my\r\n    case, and to assure him that I plainly perceived the duty and\r\n    confinement here to be too much for me; for which reason I must (I\r\n    said) beg to be at liberty to resign my charge at Michaelmas.  I\r\n    began to give him these notices in February, when I was very ill; and\r\n    now I perceive, by what he told me the other day, that he is in some\r\n    difficulty: for which reason he is at last (he says) resolved to\r\n    advertise, _and even_ (_which is much wondered at_) _to raise the\r\n    salary considerably __higher_.  (What he allowed my predecessors was\r\n    20_l._ per annum; and now he proposes 50_l._, as he tells me.)  I\r\n    never asked him to raise it for me, though I well knew it was not\r\n    equal to the duty; nor did I say a word about myself when he lately\r\n    suggested to me his intentions upon this subject.”\r\n\r\nIn a postscript to this letter he says:\r\n\r\n    “I may mention to you farther, as a friend that may be trusted, that\r\n    in all likelihood the poor old gentleman will not find it a very easy\r\n    matter, unless by dint of money, _and force upon himself_, to procure\r\n    a man that he can like for his next curate, _nor one that will stay\r\n    with him so long as I have done_.  Then, his great age will recur to\r\n    people’s thoughts; and if he has any foibles, either in temper or\r\n    conduct, they will be sure not to be forgotten on this occasion by\r\n    those who know him; and those who do not will probably be on their\r\n    guard.  On these and the like considerations, it is by no means an\r\n    eligible office to be seeking out for a curate for him, as he has\r\n    several times wished me to do; and would, if he knew that I am now\r\n    writing to you, wish your assistance also.  But my best friends here,\r\n    _who well foresee the probable consequences_, and wish me well,\r\n    earnestly dissuade me from complying: and I will decline the office\r\n    with as much decency as I can: but high salary will, I suppose, fetch\r\n    in somebody or other, soon.”\r\n\r\nIn the following July he writes:\r\n\r\n    “The old gentleman here (I may venture to tell you freely) seems to\r\n    me to be in a pretty odd way of late—moping, dejected, self-willed,\r\n    and as if surrounded with some perplexing circumstances.  Though I\r\n    visit him pretty frequently for short intervals, I say very little to\r\n    his affairs, not choosing to be a party concerned, especially in\r\n    cases of so critical and tender a nature.  There is much mystery in\r\n    almost all his temporal affairs, as well as in many of his\r\n    speculative theories.  Whoever lives in this neighborhood to see his\r\n    exit will probably see and hear some very strange things.  Time will\r\n    show;—I am afraid, not greatly to his credit.  There is thought to be\r\n    _an irremovable obstruction to his happiness within his walls_, _as\r\n    well as another without them_; but the former is the more powerful,\r\n    and like to continue so.  He has this day been trying anew to engage\r\n    me to stay with him.  No lucrative views can tempt me to sacrifice my\r\n    liberty or my health, to such measures as are proposed here.  _Nor do\r\n    I like to __have to do with persons whose word and honor cannot be\r\n    depended on_.  So much for this very odd and unhappy topic.”\r\n\r\nIn August Mr. Jones’s tone is slightly modified.  Earnest entreaties, not\r\nlucrative considerations, have induced him to cheer the Doctor’s dejected\r\nheart by remaining at Welwyn some time longer.  The Doctor is, “in\r\nvarious respects, a very unhappy man,” and few know so much of these\r\nrespects as Mr. Jones.  In September he recurs to the subject:\r\n\r\n    “My ancient gentleman here is still full of trouble, which moves my\r\n    concern, though it moves only the secret laughter of many, and some\r\n    untoward surmises in disfavor of him and his household.  The loss of\r\n    a very large sum of money (about 200_l._) is talked of; whereof this\r\n    vill and neighborhood is full.  Some disbelieve; others says, ‘_It is\r\n    no wonder_, _where about eighteen or more servants are sometimes\r\n    taken and dismissed in the course of a year_.’  The gentleman himself\r\n    is allowed by all to be far more harmless and easy in his family than\r\n    some one else who hath too much the lead in it.  This, among others,\r\n    was one reason for my late motion to quit.”\r\n\r\nNo other mention of Young’s affairs occurs until April 2d, 1765, when he\r\nsays that Dr. Young is very ill, attended by two physicians.\r\n\r\n    “Having mentioned this young gentleman (Dr. Young’s son), I would\r\n    acquaint you next, that he came hither this morning, having been sent\r\n    for, as I am told, by the direction of Mrs. Hallows.  Indeed, she\r\n    intimated to me as much herself.  And if this be so, I must say, that\r\n    it is one of the most prudent Acts she ever did, or could have done\r\n    in such a case as this; as it may prove a means of preventing much\r\n    confusion after the death of the Doctor.  I have had some little\r\n    discourse with the son: he seems much affected, and I believe really\r\n    is so.  He earnestly wishes his father might be pleased to ask after\r\n    him; for you must know he has not yet done this, nor is, in my\r\n    opinion, like to do it.  And it has been said farther, that upon a\r\n    late application made to him on the behalf of his son, he desired\r\n    that no more might be said to him about it.  How true this may be I\r\n    cannot as yet be certain; all I shall say is, it seems not improbable\r\n    . . . I heartily wish the ancient man’s heart may prove tender toward\r\n    his son; _though_, _knowing him so well_, _I can scarce hope to hear\r\n    such desirable news_.”\r\n\r\nEleven days later he writes:\r\n\r\n    “I have now the pleasure to acquaint you, that the late Dr. Young,\r\n    though he had for many years kept his son at a distance from him, yet\r\n    has now at last left him all his possessions, after the payment of\r\n    certain legacies; so that the young gentleman (who bears a fair\r\n    character, and behaves well, as far as I can hear or see) will, I\r\n    hope, soon enjoy and make a prudent use of a handsome fortune.  The\r\n    father, on his deathbed, and since my return from London, was applied\r\n    to in the tenderest manner, by one of his physicians, and by another\r\n    person, to admit the son into his presence, to make submission,\r\n    intreat forgiveness, and obtain his blessing.  As to an interview\r\n    with his son, he intimated that he chose to decline it, as his\r\n    spirits were then low and his nerves weak.  With regard to the next\r\n    particular, he said, ‘_I heartily forgive him_;’ and upon ‘mention of\r\n    this last, he gently lifted up his hand, and letting it gently fall,\r\n    pronounced these words, ‘_God bless him_!’ . . . I know it will give\r\n    you pleasure to be farther informed that he was pleased to make\r\n    respectful mention of me in his will; expressing his satisfaction in\r\n    my care of his parish, _bequeathing to me a handsome legacy_, and\r\n    appointing me to be one of his executors.”\r\n\r\nSo far Mr. Jones, in his confidential correspondence with a “friend, who\r\nmay be trusted.”  In a letter communicated apparently by him to the\r\n_Gentleman’s Magazine_, seven years later, namely, in 1782, on the\r\nappearance of Croft’s biography of Young, we find him speaking of “the\r\nancient gentleman” in a tone of reverential eulogy, quite at variance\r\nwith the free comments we have just quoted.  But the Rev. John Jones was\r\nprobably of opinion, with Mrs. Montagu, whose contemporary and\r\nretrospective letters are also set in a different key, that “the\r\ninterests of religion were connected with the character of a man so\r\ndistinguished for piety as Dr. Young.”  At all events, a subsequent\r\nquasi-official statement weighs nothing as evidence against contemporary,\r\nspontaneous, and confidential hints.\r\n\r\nTo Mrs. Hallows, Young left a legacy of £1000, with the request that she\r\nwould destroy all his manuscripts.  This final request, from some unknown\r\ncause, was not complied with, and among the papers he left behind him was\r\nthe following letter from Archbishop Secker, which probably marks the\r\ndate of his latest effort after preferment:\r\n\r\n                                     “DEANERY OF ST. PAUL’S, July 8, 1758.\r\n\r\n    “Good DR. YOUNG: I have long wondered that more suitable notice of\r\n    your great merit hath not been taken by persons in power.  But how to\r\n    remedy the omission I see not.  No encouragement hath ever been given\r\n    me to mention things of this nature to his Majesty.  And therefore,\r\n    in all likelihood, the only consequence of doing it would be\r\n    weakening the little influence which else I may possibly have on some\r\n    other occasions.  _Your fortune and your reputation set you above the\r\n    need of advancement_; _and your sentiments above that concern for\r\n    it_, _on your own account_, which, on that of the public, is\r\n    sincerely felt by\r\n\r\n    “Your loving Brother,\r\n\r\n                                                              “THO. CANT.”\r\n\r\nThe loving brother’s irony is severe!\r\n\r\nPerhaps the least questionable testimony to the better side of Young’s\r\ncharacter is that of Bishop Hildesley, who, as the vicar of a parish near\r\nWelwyn, had been Young’s neighbor for upward of twenty years.  The\r\naffection of the clergy for each other, we have observed, is, like that\r\nof the fair sex, not at all of a blind and infatuated kind; and we may\r\ntherefore the rather believe them when they give each other any\r\nextra-official praise.  Bishop Hildesley, then writing of Young to\r\nRichardson, says:\r\n\r\n    “The impertinence of my frequent visits to him was amply rewarded;\r\n    forasmuch as, I can truly say, he never received me but with\r\n    agreeable open complacency; and I never left him but with profitable\r\n    pleasure and improvement.  He was one or other, the most modest, the\r\n    most patient of contradiction, and the most informing and\r\n    entertaining I ever conversed with—at least, of any man who had so\r\n    just pretensions to pertinacity and reserve.”\r\n\r\nMr. Langton, however, who was also a frequent visitor of Young’s,\r\ninformed Boswell—\r\n\r\n    “That there was an air of benevolence in his manner; but that he\r\n    could obtain from him less information than he had hoped to receive\r\n    from one who had lived so much in intercourse with the brightest men\r\n    of what had been called the Augustan age of England; and that he\r\n    showed a degree of eager curiosity concerning the common occurrences\r\n    that were then passing, which appeared somewhat remarkable in a man\r\n    of such intellectual stores, of such an advanced age, and who had\r\n    retired from life with declared disappointment in his expectations.”\r\n\r\nThe same substance, we know, will exhibit different qualities under\r\ndifferent tests; and, after all, imperfect reports of individual\r\nimpressions, whether immediate or traditional, are a very frail basis on\r\nwhich to build our opinion of a man.  One’s character may be very\r\nindifferently mirrored in the mind of the most intimate neighbor; it all\r\ndepends on the quality of that gentleman’s reflecting surface.\r\n\r\nBut, discarding any inferences from such uncertain evidence, the outline\r\nof Young’s character is too distinctly traceable in the well-attested\r\nfacts of his life, and yet more in the self-betrayal that runs through\r\nall his works, for us to fear that our general estimate of him may be\r\nfalse.  For, while no poet seems less easy and spontaneous than Young, no\r\npoet discloses himself more completely.  Men’s minds have no hiding-place\r\nout of themselves—their affectations do but betray another phase of their\r\nnature.  And if, in the present view of Young, we seem to be more intent\r\non laying bare unfavorable facts than on shrouding them in “charitable\r\nspeeches,” it is not because we have any irreverential pleasure in\r\nturning men’s characters “the seamy side without,” but because we see no\r\ngreat advantage in considering a man as he was _not_.  Young’s\r\nbiographers and critics have usually set out from the position that he\r\nwas a great religious teacher, and that his poetry is morally sublime;\r\nand they have toned down his failings into harmony with their conception\r\nof the divine and the poet.  For our own part, we set out from precisely\r\nthe opposite conviction—namely, that the religious and moral spirit of\r\nYoung’s poetry is low and false, and we think it of some importance to\r\nshow that the “Night Thoughts” are the reflex of the mind in which the\r\nhigher human sympathies were inactive.  This judgment is entirely opposed\r\nto our youthful predilections and enthusiasm.  The sweet garden-breath of\r\nearly enjoyment lingers about many a page of the “Night Thoughts,” and\r\neven of the “Last Day,” giving an extrinsic charm to passages of stilted\r\nrhetoric and false sentiment; but the sober and repeated reading of\r\nmaturer years has convinced us that it would hardly be possible to find a\r\nmore typical instance than Young’s poetry, of the mistake which\r\nsubstitutes interested obedience for sympathetic emotion, and baptizes\r\negoism as religion.\r\n\r\n                                * * * * *\r\n\r\nPope said of Young, that he had “much of a sublime genius without\r\ncommon-sense.”  The deficiency Pope meant to indicate was, we imagine,\r\nmoral rather than intellectual: it was the want of that fine sense of\r\nwhat is fitting in speech and action, which is often eminently possessed\r\nby men and women whose intellect is of a very common order, but who have\r\nthe sincerity and dignity which can never coexist with the selfish\r\npreoccupations of vanity or interest.  This was the “common-sense” in\r\nwhich Young was conspicuously deficient; and it was partly owing to this\r\ndeficiency that his genius, waiting to be determined by the highest\r\nprize, fluttered uncertainly from effort to effort, until, when he was\r\nmore than sixty, it suddenly spread its broad wing, and soared so as to\r\narrest the gaze of other generations besides his own.  For he had no\r\nversatility of faculty to mislead him.  The “Night Thoughts” only differ\r\nfrom his previous works in the degree and not in the kind of power they\r\nmanifest.  Whether he writes prose or poetry, rhyme or blank verse,\r\ndramas, satires, odes, or meditations, we see everywhere the same\r\nYoung—the same narrow circle of thoughts, the same love of abstractions,\r\nthe same telescopic view of human things, the same appetency toward\r\nantithetic apothegm and rhapsodic climax.  The passages that arrest us in\r\nhis tragedies are those in which he anticipates some fine passage in the\r\n“Night Thoughts,” and where his characters are only transparent shadows\r\nthrough which we see the bewigged _embonpoint_ of the didactic poet,\r\nexcogitating epigrams or ecstatic soliloquies by the light of a candle\r\nfixed in a skull.  Thus, in “The Revenge,” “Alonzo,” in the conflict of\r\njealousy and love that at once urges and forbids him to murder his wife,\r\nsays:\r\n\r\n    “This vast and solid earth, that blazing sun,\r\n    Those skies, through which it rolls, must all have end.\r\n    What then is man?  The smallest part of nothing.\r\n    Day buries day; month, month; and year the year!\r\n    Our life is but a chain of many deaths.\r\n    Can then Death’s self be feared?  Our life much rather:\r\n    _Life is the desert_, _life the solitude_;\r\n    Death joins us to the great majority;\r\n    ’Tis to be born to Plato and to Cæsar;\r\n    ’Tis to be great forever;\r\n    ’Tis pleasure, ’tis ambition, then, to die.”\r\n\r\nHis prose writings all read like the “Night Thoughts,” either diluted\r\ninto prose or not yet crystallized into poetry.  For example, in his\r\n“Thoughts for Age,” he says:\r\n\r\n    “Though we stand on its awful brink, such our leaden bias to the\r\n    world, we turn our faces the wrong way; we are still looking on our\r\n    old acquaintance, _Time_; though now so wasted and reduced, that we\r\n    can see little more of him than his wings and his scythe: our age\r\n    enlarges his wings to our imagination; and our fear of death, his\r\n    scythe; as Time himself grows less.  His consumption is deep; his\r\n    annihilation is at hand.”\r\n\r\nThis is a dilution of the magnificent image—\r\n\r\n    “Time in advance behind him hides his wings,\r\n    And seems to creep decrepit with his age.\r\n    Behold him when past by!  What then is seen\r\n    But his proud pinions, swifter than the winds?”\r\n\r\nAgain:\r\n\r\n    “A requesting Omnipotence?  What can stun and confound thy reason\r\n    more?  What more can ravish and exalt thy heart?  It cannot but\r\n    ravish and exalt; it cannot but gloriously disturb and perplex thee,\r\n    to take in all _that_ suggests.  Thou child of the dust!  Thou speck\r\n    of misery and sin!  How abject thy weakness! how great is thy power!\r\n    Thou crawler on earth, and possible (I was about to say) controller\r\n    of the skies!  Weigh, and weigh well, the wondrous truths I have in\r\n    view: which cannot be weighed too much; which the more they are\r\n    weighed, amaze the more; which to have supposed, before they were\r\n    revealed, would have been as great madness, and to have presumed on\r\n    as great sin, as it is now madness and sin not to believe.”\r\n\r\nEven in his Pindaric odes, in which he made the most violent efforts\r\nagainst nature, he is still neither more nor less than the Young of the\r\n“Last Day,” emptied and swept of his genius, and possessed by seven\r\ndemons of fustian and bad rhyme.  Even here his “Ercles’ Vein” alternates\r\nwith his moral platitudes, and we have the perpetual text of the “Night\r\nThoughts:”\r\n\r\n       “Gold pleasure buys;\r\n       But pleasure dies,\r\n    For soon the gross fruition cloys;\r\n       Though raptures court,\r\n       The sense is short;\r\n    But virtue kindles living joys;—\r\n\r\n       “Joys felt alone!\r\n       Joys asked of none!\r\n    Which Time’s and fortune’s arrows miss:\r\n       Joys that subsist,\r\n       Though fates resist,\r\n    An unprecarious, endless bliss!\r\n\r\n       “Unhappy they!\r\n       And falsely gay!\r\n    Who bask forever in success;\r\n       A constant feast\r\n       Quite palls the taste,\r\n    _And long enjoyment is distress_.”\r\n\r\nIn the “Last Day,” again, which is the earliest thing he wrote, we have\r\nan anticipation of all his greatest faults and merits.  Conspicuous among\r\nthe faults is that attempt to exalt our conceptions of Deity by vulgar\r\nimages and comparisons, which is so offensive in the later “Night\r\nThoughts.”  In a burst of prayer and homage to God, called forth by the\r\ncontemplation of Christ coming to judgment, he asks, Who brings the\r\nchange of the seasons? and answers:\r\n\r\n    “Not the great Ottoman, or Greater Czar;\r\n    Not Europe’s arbitress of peace and war!”\r\n\r\nConceive the soul in its most solemn moments, assuring God that it\r\ndoesn’t place his power below that of Louis Napoleon or Queen Victoria!\r\n\r\nBut in the midst of uneasy rhymes, inappropriate imagery, vaulting\r\nsublimity that o’erleaps itself, and vulgar emotions, we have in this\r\npoem an occasional flash of genius, a touch of simple grandeur, which\r\npromises as much as Young ever achieved.  Describing the on-coming of the\r\ndissolution of all things, he says:\r\n\r\n    “No sun in radiant glory shines on high;\r\n    _No light but from the terrors of the sky_.”\r\n\r\nAnd again, speaking of great armies:\r\n\r\n    “Whose rear lay wrapt in night, while breaking dawn\r\n    Rous’d the broad front, and call’d the battle on.”\r\n\r\nAnd this wail of the lost souls is fine:\r\n\r\n             “And this for sin?\r\n    Could I offend if I had never been?\r\n    But still increas’d the senseless, happy mass,\r\n    Flow’d in the stream, _or shiver’d in the grass_?\r\n    Father of mercies!  Why from silent earth\r\n    Didst thou awake and curse me into birth?\r\n    Tear me from quiet, ravish me from night,\r\n    And make a thankless present of thy light?\r\n    Push into being a reverse of Thee,\r\n    And _animate a clod with misery_?”\r\n\r\nBut it is seldom in Young’s rhymed poems that the effect of a felicitous\r\nthought or image is not counteracted by our sense of the constraint he\r\nsuffered from the necessities of rhyme—that “Gothic demon,” as he\r\nafterward called it, “which, modern poetry tasting, became mortal.”  In\r\nrelation to his own power, no one will question the truth of this dictum,\r\nthat “blank verse is verse unfallen, uncurst; verse reclaimed,\r\nreinthroned in the true language of the gods; who never thundered nor\r\nsuffered their Homer to thunder in rhyme.”  His want of mastery in rhyme\r\nis especially a drawback on the effects of his Satires; for epigrams and\r\nwitticisms are peculiarly susceptible to the intrusion of a superfluous\r\nword, or to an inversion which implies constraint.  Here, even more than\r\nelsewhere, the art that conceals art is an absolute requisite, and to\r\nhave a witticism presented to us in limping or cumbrous rhythm is as\r\ncounteractive to any electrifying effect as to see the tentative grimaces\r\nby which a comedian prepares a grotesque countenance.  We discern the\r\nprocess, instead of being startled by the result.\r\n\r\nThis is one reason why the Satires, read _seriatim_, have a flatness to\r\nus, which, when we afterward read picked passages, we are inclined to\r\ndisbelieve in, and to attribute to some deficiency in our own mood.  But\r\nthere are deeper reasons for that dissatisfaction.  Young is not a\r\nsatirist of a high order.  His satire has neither the terrible vigor, the\r\nlacerating energy of genuine indignation, nor the humor which owns loving\r\nfellowship with the poor human nature it laughs at; nor yet the personal\r\nbitterness which, as in Pope’s characters of Sporus and Atticus, insures\r\nthose living touches by virtue of which the individual and particular in\r\nArt becomes the universal and immortal.  Young could never describe a\r\nreal, complex human being; but what he _could_ do with eminent success\r\nwas to describe, with neat and finished point, obvious _types_, of\r\nmanners rather than of character—to write cold and clever epigrams on\r\npersonified vices and absurdities.  There is no more emotion in his\r\nsatire than if he were turning witty verses on a waxen image of Cupid or\r\na lady’s glove.  He has none of these felicitious epithets, none of those\r\npregnant lines, by which Pope’s Satires have enriched the ordinary speech\r\nof educated men.  Young’s wit will be found in almost every instance to\r\nconsist in that antithetic combination of ideas which, of all the forms\r\nof wit, is most within reach of a clever effort.  In his gravest\r\narguments, as well as in his lightest satire, one might imagine that he\r\nhad set himself to work out the problem, how much antithesis might be got\r\nout of a given subject.  And there he completely succeeds.  His neatest\r\nportraits are all wrought on this plan.  “Narcissus,” for example, who\r\n\r\n    “Omits no duty; nor can Envy say\r\n    He miss’d, these many years, the Church or Play:\r\n    He makes no noise in Parliament, ’tis true;\r\n    But pays his debts, and visit when ’tis due;\r\n    His character and gloves are ever clean,\r\n    And then he can out-bow the bowing Dean;\r\n    A smile eternal on his lip he wears,\r\n    Which equally the wise and worthless shares.\r\n    In gay fatigues, this most undaunted chief,\r\n    Patient of idleness beyond belief,\r\n    Most charitably lends the town his face\r\n    For ornament in every public place;\r\n    As sure as cards he to th’ assembly comes,\r\n    And is the furniture of drawing-rooms:\r\n    When Ombre calls, his hand and heart are free,\r\n    And, joined to two, he fails not—to make three;\r\n    Narcissus is the glory of his race;\r\n    For who does nothing with a better grace?\r\n    To deck my list by nature were designed\r\n    Such shining expletives of human kind,\r\n    Who want, while through blank life they dream along,\r\n    Sense to be right and passion to be wrong.”\r\n\r\nIt is but seldom that we find a touch of that easy slyness which gives an\r\nadditional zest to surprise; but here is an instance:\r\n\r\n    “See Tityrus, with merriment possest,\r\n    Is burst with laughter ere he hears the jest,\r\n    What need he stay, for when the joke is o’er,\r\n    His _teeth_ will be no whiter than before.”\r\n\r\nLike Pope, whom he imitated, he sets out with a psychological mistake as\r\nthe basis of his satire, attributing all forms of folly to one\r\npassion—the love of fame, or vanity—a much grosser mistake, indeed, than\r\nPope’s, exaggeration of the extent to which the “ruling passion”\r\ndetermines conduct in the individual.  Not that Young is consistent in\r\nhis mistake.  He sometimes implies no more than what is the truth—that\r\nthe love of fame is the cause, not of all follies, but of many.\r\n\r\nYoung’s satires on women are superior to Pope’s, which is only saying\r\nthat they are superior to Pope’s greatest failure.  We can more\r\nfrequently pick out a couplet as successful than an entire sketch.  Of\r\nthe too emphatic “Syrena” he says:\r\n\r\n    “Her judgment just, her sentence is too strong;\r\n    Because she’s right, she’s ever in the wrong.”\r\n\r\nOf the diplomatic “Julia:”\r\n\r\n    “For her own breakfast she’ll project a scheme,\r\n    Nor take her tea without a stratagem.”\r\n\r\nOf “Lyce,” the old painted coquette:\r\n\r\n    “In vain the cock has summoned sprites away;\r\n    She walks at noon and blasts the bloom of day.”\r\n\r\nOf the nymph, who, “gratis, clears religious mysteries:”\r\n\r\n    “’Tis hard, too, she who makes no use but chat\r\n    Of her religion, should be barr’d in that.”\r\n\r\nThe description of the literary _belle_, “Daphne,” well prefaces that of\r\n“Stella,” admired by Johnson:\r\n\r\n    “With legs toss’d high, on her sophee she sits,\r\n    Vouchsafing audience to contending wits:\r\n    Of each performance she’s the final test;\r\n    One act read o’er, she prophecies the rest;\r\n    And then, pronouncing with decisive air,\r\n    Fully convinces all the town—_she’s fair_.\r\n    Had lonely Daphne Hecatessa’s face,\r\n    How would her elegance of taste decrease!\r\n    Some ladies’ judgment in their features lies,\r\n    And all their genius sparkles in their eyes.\r\n    But hold, she cries, lampooner! have a care;\r\n    Must I want common sense because I’m fair?\r\n    O no; see Stella: her eyes shine as bright\r\n    As if her tongue was never in the right;\r\n    And yet what real learning, judgment, fire!\r\n    She seems inspir’d, and can herself inspire.\r\n    How then (if malice ruled not all the fair)\r\n    _Could Daphne publish_, _and could she forbear_?”\r\n\r\nAfter all, when we have gone through Young’s seven Satires, we seem to\r\nhave made but an indifferent meal.  They are a sort of fricassee, with\r\nsome little solid meat in them, and yet the flavor is not always piquant.\r\nIt is curious to find him, when he pauses a moment from his satiric\r\nsketching, recurring to his old platitudes:\r\n\r\n    “Can gold calm passion, or make reason shine?\r\n    Can we dig peace or wisdom from the mine?\r\n    Wisdom to gold prefer;”—\r\n\r\nplatitudes which he seems inevitably to fall into, for the same reason\r\nthat some men are constantly asserting their contempt for\r\ncriticism—because he felt the opposite so keenly.\r\n\r\nThe outburst of genius in the earlier books of the “Night Thoughts” is\r\nthe more remarkable, that in the interval between them and the Satires he\r\nhad produced nothing but his Pindaric odes, in which he fell far below\r\nthe level of his previous works.  Two sources of this sudden strength\r\nwere the freedom of blank verse and the presence of a genuine emotion.\r\nMost persons, in speaking of the “Night Thoughts,” have in their minds\r\nonly the two or three first Nights, the majority of readers rarely\r\ngetting beyond these, unless, as Wilson says, they “have but few books,\r\nare poor, and live in the country.”  And in these earlier Nights there is\r\nenough genuine sublimity and genuine sadness to bribe us into too\r\nfavorable a judgment of them as a whole.  Young had only a very few\r\nthings to say or sing—such as that life is vain, that death is imminent,\r\nthat man is immortal, that virtue is wisdom, that friendship is sweet,\r\nand that the source of virtue is the contemplation of death and\r\nimmortality—and even in his two first Nights he had said almost all he\r\nhad to say in his finest manner.  Through these first outpourings of\r\n“complaint” we feel that the poet is really sad, that the bird is singing\r\nover a rifled nest; and we bear with his morbid picture of the world and\r\nof life, as the Job-like lament of a man whom “the hand of God hath\r\ntouched.”  Death has carried away his best-beloved, and that “silent\r\nland” whither they are gone has more reality for the desolate one than\r\nthis world which is empty of their love:\r\n\r\n    “This is the desert, this the solitude;\r\n    How populous, how vital is the grave!”\r\n\r\nJoy died with the loved one:\r\n\r\n             “The disenchanted earth\r\n    Lost all her lustre.  Where her glitt’ring towers?\r\n    Her golden mountains, where?  All darkened down\r\n    To naked waste; a dreary vale of tears:\r\n    _The great magician’s dead_!”\r\n\r\nUnder the pang of parting, it seems to the bereaved man as if love were\r\nonly a nerve to suffer with, and he sickens at the thought of every joy\r\nof which he must one day say—“_it __was_.”  In its unreasoning anguish,\r\nthe soul rushes to the idea of perpetuity as the one element of bliss:\r\n\r\n    “O ye blest scenes of permanent delight!—\r\n    Could ye, so rich in rapture, fear an end,—\r\n    That ghastly thought would drink up all your joy,\r\n    And quite unparadise the realms of light.”\r\n\r\nIn a man under the immediate pressure of a great sorrow, we tolerate\r\nmorbid exaggerations; we are prepared to see him turn away a weary eye\r\nfrom sunlight and flowers and sweet human faces, as if this rich and\r\nglorious life had no significance but as a preliminary of death; we do\r\nnot criticise his views, we compassionate his feelings.  And so it is\r\nwith Young in these earlier Nights.  There is already some artificiality\r\neven in his grief, and feeling often slides into rhetoric, but through it\r\nall we are thrilled with the unmistakable cry of pain, which makes us\r\ntolerant of egoism and hyperbole:\r\n\r\n    “In every varied posture, place, and hour,\r\n    How widow’d every thought of every joy!\r\n    Thought, busy thought! too busy for my peace!\r\n    Through the dark postern of time long elapsed\r\n    Led softly, by the stillness of the night,—\r\n    Led like a murderer (and such it proves!)\r\n    Strays (wretched rover!) o’er the pleasing past,—\r\n    In quest of wretchedness, perversely strays;\r\n    And finds all desert now; and meets the ghosts\r\n    Of my departed joys.”\r\n\r\nBut when he becomes didactic, rather than complaining—when he ceases to\r\nsing his sorrows, and begins to insist on his opinions—when that distaste\r\nfor life which we pity as a transient feeling is thrust upon us as a\r\ntheory, we become perfectly cool and critical, and are not in the least\r\ninclined to be indulgent to false views and selfish sentiments.\r\n\r\nSeeing that we are about to be severe on Young’s failings and failures,\r\nwe ought, if a reviewer’s space were elastic, to dwell also on his\r\nmerits—on the startling vigor of his imagery—on the occasional grandeur\r\nof his thought—on the piquant force of that grave satire into which his\r\nmeditations continually run.  But, since our “limits” are rigorous, we\r\nmust content ourselves with the less agreeable half of the critic’s duty;\r\nand we may the rather do so, because it would be difficult to say\r\nanything new of Young, in the way of admiration, while we think there are\r\nmany salutary lessons remaining to be drawn from his faults.\r\n\r\nOne of the most striking characteristics of Young is his _radical\r\ninsincerity as a poetic artist_.  This, added to the thin and artificial\r\ntexture of his wit, is the true explanation of the paradox—that a poet\r\nwho is often inopportunely witty has the opposite vice of bombastic\r\nabsurdity.  The source of all grandiloquence is the want of taking for a\r\ncriterion the true qualities of the object described or the emotion\r\nexpressed.  The grandiloquent man is never bent on saying what he feels\r\nor what he sees, but on producing a certain effect on his audience; hence\r\nhe may float away into utter inanity without meeting any criterion to\r\narrest him.  Here lies the distinction between grandiloquence and genuine\r\nfancy or bold imaginativeness.  The fantastic or the boldly imaginative\r\npoet may be as sincere as the most realistic: he is true to his own\r\nsensibilities or inward vision, and in his wildest flights he never\r\nbreaks loose from his criterion—the truth of his own mental state.  Now,\r\nthis disruption of language from genuine thought and feeling is what we\r\nare constantly detecting in Young; and his insincerity is the more likely\r\nto betray him into absurdity, because he habitually treats of\r\nabstractions, and not of concrete objects or specific emotions.  He\r\ndescants perpetually on virtue, religion, “the good man,” life, death,\r\nimmortality, eternity—subjects which are apt to give a factitious\r\ngrandeur to empty wordiness.  When a poet floats in the empyrean, and\r\nonly takes a bird’s-eye view of the earth, some people accept the mere\r\nfact of his soaring for sublimity, and mistake his dim vision of earth\r\nfor proximity to heaven.  Thus:\r\n\r\n    “His hand the good man fixes on the skies,\r\n    And bids earth roll, nor feels her idle whirl,”\r\n\r\nmay, perhaps, pass for sublime with some readers.  But pause a moment to\r\nrealize the image, and the monstrous absurdity of a man’s grasping the\r\nskies, and hanging habitually suspended there, while he contemptuously\r\nbids the earth roll, warns you that no genuine feeling could have\r\nsuggested so unnatural a conception.  Again,\r\n\r\n    “See the man immortal: him, I mean,\r\n    Who lives as such; whose heart, full bent on Heaven,\r\n    Leans all that way, his bias to the stars.”\r\n\r\nThis is worse than the previous example: for you can at least form some\r\nimperfect conception of a man hanging from the skies, though the position\r\nstrikes you as uncomfortable and of no particular use; but you are\r\nutterly unable to imagine how his heart can lean toward the stars.\r\nExamples of such vicious imagery, resulting from insincerity, may be\r\nfound, perhaps, in almost every page of the “Night Thoughts.”  But simple\r\nassertions or aspirations, undisguised by imagery, are often equally\r\nfalse.  No writer whose rhetoric was checked by the slightest truthful\r\nintentions could have said—\r\n\r\n    “An eye of awe and wonder let me roll,\r\n    And roll forever.”\r\n\r\nAbstracting the more poetical associations with the eye, this is hardly\r\nless absurd than if he had wished to stand forever with his mouth open.\r\n\r\nAgain:\r\n\r\n             “Far beneath\r\n    A soul immortal is a mortal joy.”\r\n\r\nHappily for human nature, we are sure no man really believes that.  Which\r\nof us has the impiety not to feel that our souls are only too narrow for\r\nthe joy of looking into the trusting eyes of our children, of reposing on\r\nthe love of a husband or a wife—nay, of listening to the divine voice of\r\nmusic, or watching the calm brightness of autumnal afternoons?  But Young\r\ncould utter this falsity without detecting it, because, when he spoke of\r\n“mortal joys,” he rarely had in his mind any object to which he could\r\nattach sacredness.  He was thinking of bishoprics, and benefices, of\r\nsmiling monarchs, patronizing prime ministers, and a “much indebted\r\nmuse.”  Of anything between these and eternal bliss he was but rarely and\r\nmoderately conscious.  Often, indeed, he sinks very much below even the\r\nbishopric, and seems to have no notion of earthly pleasure but such as\r\nbreathes gaslight and the fumes of wine.  His picture of life is\r\nprecisely such as you would expect from a man who has risen from his bed\r\nat two o’clock in the afternoon with a headache and a dim remembrance\r\nthat he has added to his “debts of honor:”\r\n\r\n    “What wretched repetition cloys us here!\r\n    What periodic potions for the sick,\r\n    Distemper’d bodies, and distemper’d minds?”\r\n\r\nAnd then he flies off to his usual antithesis:\r\n\r\n    “In an eternity what scenes shall strike!\r\n    Adventures thicken, novelties surprise!”\r\n\r\n“Earth” means lords and levees, duchesses and Dalilahs, South-Sea dreams,\r\nand illegal percentage; and the only things distinctly preferable to\r\nthese are eternity and the stars.  Deprive Young of this antithesis, and\r\nmore than half his eloquence would be shrivelled up.  Place him on a\r\nbreezy common, where the furze is in its golden bloom, where children are\r\nplaying, and horses are standing in the sunshine with fondling necks, and\r\nhe would have nothing to say.  Here are neither depths of guilt nor\r\nheights of glory; and we doubt whether in such a scene he would be able\r\nto pay his usual compliment to the Creator:\r\n\r\n    “Where’er I turn, what claim on all applause!”\r\n\r\nIt is true that he sometimes—not often—speaks of virtue as capable of\r\nsweetening life, as well as of taking the sting from death and winning\r\nheaven; and, lest we should be guilty of any unfairness to him, we will\r\nquote the two passages which convey this sentiment the most explicitly.\r\nIn the one he gives “Lorenzo” this excellent recipe for obtaining\r\ncheerfulness:\r\n\r\n             “Go, fix some weighty truth;\r\n    Chain down some passion; do some generous good;\r\n    Teach Ignorance to see, or Grief to smile;\r\n    Correct thy friend; befriend thy greatest foe;\r\n    Or, with warm heart, and confidence divine,\r\n    Spring up, and lay strong hold on Him who made thee.”\r\n\r\nThe other passage is vague, but beautiful, and its music has murmured in\r\nour minds for many years:\r\n\r\n             “The cuckoo seasons sing\r\n    The same dull note to such as nothing prize\r\n    But what those seasons from the teeming earth\r\n    To doting sense indulge.  But nobler minds,\r\n    Which relish fruit unripened by the sun,\r\n    Make their days various; various as the dyes\r\n    On the dove’s neck, which wanton in his rays.\r\n    On minds of dove-like innocence possess’d,\r\n    On lighten’d minds that bask in Virtue’s beams,\r\n    Nothing hangs tedious, nothing old revolves\r\n    In that for which they long, for which they live.\r\n    Their glorious efforts, winged with heavenly hopes,\r\n    Each rising morning sees still higher rise;\r\n    Each bounteous dawn its novelty presents\r\n    To worth maturing, new strength, lustre, fame;\r\n    While Nature’s circle, like a chariot wheel,\r\n    Boiling beneath their elevated aims,\r\n    Makes their fair prospect fairer every hour;\r\n    Advancing virtue in a line to bliss.”\r\n\r\nEven here, where he is in his most amiable mood, you see at what a\r\ntelescopic distance he stands from mother Earth and simple human\r\njoys—“Nature’s circle rolls beneath.”  Indeed, we remember no mind in\r\npoetic literature that seems to have absorbed less of the beauty and the\r\nhealthy breath of the common landscape than Young’s.  His images, often\r\ngrand and finely presented—witness that sublimely sudden leap of thought,\r\n\r\n    “Embryos we must be till we burst the shell,\r\n    _Yon ambient azure shell_, and spring to life”—\r\n\r\nlie almost entirely within that circle of observation which would be\r\nfamiliar to a man who lived in town, hung about the theatres, read the\r\nnewspaper, and went home often by moon and starlight.\r\n\r\nThere is no natural object nearer than the moon that seems to have any\r\nstrong attraction for him, and even to the moon he chiefly appeals for\r\npatronage, and “pays his court” to her.  It is reckoned among the many\r\ndeficiencies of “Lorenzo” that he “never asked the moon one question”—an\r\nomission which Young thinks eminently unbecoming a rational being.  He\r\ndescribes nothing so well as a comet, and is tempted to linger with fond\r\ndetail over nothing more familiar than the day of judgment and an\r\nimaginary journey among the stars.  Once on Saturn’s ring he feels at\r\nhome, and his language becomes quite easy:\r\n\r\n             “What behold I now?\r\n    A wilderness of wonders burning round,\r\n    Where larger suns inhabit higher spheres;\r\n    Perhaps _the villas of descending gods_!”\r\n\r\nIt is like a sudden relief from a strained posture when, in the “Night\r\nThoughts,” we come on any allusion that carries us to the lanes, woods,\r\nor fields.  Such allusions are amazingly rare, and we could almost count\r\nthem on a single hand.  That we may do him no injustice, we will quote\r\nthe three best:\r\n\r\n    “Like _blossom’d trees o’erturned by vernal storm_,\r\n    Lovely in death the beauteous ruin lay.\r\n\r\n                                  * * * * *\r\n\r\n    “In the same brook none ever bathed him twice:\r\n    To the same life none ever twice awoke.\r\n    We call the brook the same—the same we think\r\n    Our life, though still more rapid in its flow;\r\n    Nor mark the much irrevocably lapsed\r\n    And mingled with the sea.”\r\n\r\n                                  * * * * *\r\n\r\n    “The crown of manhood is a winter joy;\r\n    An evergreen that stands the northern blast,\r\n    And blossoms in the rigor of our fate.”\r\n\r\nThe adherence to abstractions, or to the personification of abstractions,\r\nis closely allied in Young to the _want of genuine emotion_.  He sees\r\nvirtue sitting on a mount serene, far above the mists and storms of\r\nearth; he sees Religion coming down from the skies, with this world in\r\nher left hand and the other world in her right; but we never find him\r\ndwelling on virtue or religion as it really exists—in the emotions of a\r\nman dressed in an ordinary coat, and seated by his fireside of an\r\nevening, with his hand resting on the head of his little daughter, in\r\ncourageous effort for unselfish ends, in the internal triumph of justice\r\nand pity over personal resentment, in all the sublime self-renunciation\r\nand sweet charities which are found in the details of ordinary life.\r\nNow, emotion links itself with particulars, and only in a faint and\r\nsecondary manner with abstractions.  An orator may discourse very\r\neloquently on injustice in general, and leave his audience cold; but let\r\nhim state a special case of oppression, and every heart will throb.  The\r\nmost untheoretic persons are aware of this relation between true emotion\r\nand particular facts, as opposed to general terms, and implicitly\r\nrecognize it in the repulsion they feel toward any one who professes\r\nstrong feeling about abstractions—in the interjectional “Humbug!” which\r\nimmediately rises to their lips.  Wherever abstractions appear to excite\r\nstrong emotion, this occurs in men of active intellect and imagination,\r\nin whom the abstract term rapidly and vividly calls up the particulars it\r\nrepresents, these particulars being the true source of the emotion; and\r\nsuch men, if they wished to express their feeling, would be infallibly\r\nprompted to the presentation of details.  Strong emotion can no more be\r\ndirected to generalities apart from particulars, than skill in figures\r\ncan be directed to arithmetic apart from numbers.  Generalities are the\r\nrefuge at once of deficient intellectual activity and deficient feeling.\r\n\r\nIf we except the passages in “Philander,” “Narcissa,” and “Lucia,” there\r\nis hardly a trace of human sympathy, of self-forgetfulness in the joy or\r\nsorrow of a fellow-being, throughout this long poem, which professes to\r\ntreat the various phases of man’s destiny.  And even in the “Narcissa”\r\nNight, Young repels us by the low moral tone of his exaggerated lament.\r\nThis married step-daughter died at Lyons, and, being a Protestant, was\r\ndenied burial, so that her friends had to bury her in secret—one of the\r\nmany miserable results of superstition, but not a fact to throw an\r\neducated, still less a Christian man, into a fury of hatred and\r\nvengeance, in contemplating it after the lapse of five years.  Young,\r\nhowever, takes great pains to simulate a bad feeling:\r\n\r\n             “Of grief\r\n    And indignation rival bursts I pour’d,\r\n    Half execration mingled with my pray’r;\r\n    Kindled at man, while I his God adored;\r\n    Sore grudg’d the savage land her sacred dust;\r\n    Stamp’d the cursed soil; _and with humanity_\r\n    (_Denied Narcissa_) _wish’d them all a grave_.”\r\n\r\nThe odiously bad taste of this last clause makes us hope that it is\r\nsimply a platitude, and not intended as witticism, until he removes the\r\npossibility of this favorable doubt by immediately asking, “Flows my\r\nresentment into guilt?”\r\n\r\nWhen, by an afterthought, he attempts something like sympathy, he only\r\nbetrays more clearly his want of it.  Thus, in the first Night, when he\r\nturns from his private griefs to depict earth as a hideous abode of\r\nmisery for all mankind, and asks,\r\n\r\n    “What then am I, who sorrow for myself?”\r\n\r\nhe falls at once into calculating the benefit of sorrowing for others:\r\n\r\n    “More generous sorrow, while it sinks, exalts;\r\n    _And conscious virtue mitigates the pang_.\r\n    Nor virtue, more than prudence, bids me give\r\n    Swollen thought a second channel.”\r\n\r\nThis remarkable negation of sympathy is in perfect consistency with\r\nYoung’s theory of ethics:\r\n\r\n             “Virtue is a crime,\r\n    A crime of reason, if it costs us pain\r\n    Unpaid.”\r\n\r\nIf there is no immortality for man—\r\n\r\n    “Sense! take the rein; blind Passion, drive us on;\r\n    And Ignorance! befriend us on our way. . .\r\n    Yes; give the pulse full empire; live the Brute,\r\n    Since as the brute we die.  The sum of man,\r\n    Of godlike man, to revel and to rot.”\r\n\r\n                                  * * * * *\r\n\r\n    “If this life’s gain invites him to the deed,\r\n    Why not his country sold, his father slain?”\r\n\r\n                                  * * * * *\r\n\r\n    “Ambition, avarice, by the wise disdain’d,\r\n    Is perfect wisdom, while mankind are fools,\r\n    And think a turf or tombstone covers all.”\r\n\r\n                                  * * * * *\r\n\r\n    “Die for thy country, thou romantic fool!\r\n    Seize, seize the plank thyself, and let her sink.”\r\n\r\n                                  * * * * *\r\n\r\n    “As in the dying parent dies the child,\r\n    Virtue with Immortality expires.\r\n    Who tells me he denies his soul immortal,\r\n    _Whate’er his boost_, _has told me he’s a knave_.\r\n    _His duty ’tis to love himself alone_.\r\n    _Nor care though mankind perish if he smiles_.”\r\n\r\nWe can imagine the man who “denies his soul immortal,” replying, “It is\r\nquite possible that _you_ would be a knave, and love yourself alone, if\r\nit were not for your belief in immortality; but you are not to force upon\r\nme what would result from your own utter want of moral emotion.  I am\r\njust and honest, not because I expect to live in another world, but\r\nbecause, having felt the pain of injustice and dishonesty toward myself,\r\nI have a fellow-feeling with other men, who would suffer the same pain if\r\nI were unjust or dishonest toward them.  Why should I give my neighbor\r\nshort weight in this world, because there is not another world in which I\r\nshould have nothing to weigh out to him?  I am honest, because I don’t\r\nlike to inflict evil on others in this life, not because I’m afraid of\r\nevil to myself in another.  The fact is, I do _not_ love myself alone,\r\nwhatever logical necessity there may be for that in your mind.  I have a\r\ntender love for my wife, and children, and friends, and through that love\r\nI sympathize with like affections in other men.  It is a pang to me to\r\nwitness the sufferings of a fellow-being, and I feel his suffering the\r\nmore acutely because he is _mortal_—because his life is so short, and I\r\nwould have it, if possible, filled with happiness and not misery.\r\nThrough my union and fellowship with the men and women I _have_ seen, I\r\nfeel a like, though a fainter, sympathy with those I have _not_ seen; and\r\nI am able so to live in imagination with the generations to come, that\r\ntheir good is not alien to me, and is a stimulus to me to labor for ends\r\nwhich may not benefit myself, but will benefit them.  It is possible that\r\nyou may prefer to ‘live the brute,’ to sell your country, or to slay your\r\nfather, if you were not afraid of some disagreeable consequences from the\r\ncriminal laws of another world; but even if I could conceive no motive\r\nbut my own worldly interest or the gratification of my animal desire, I\r\nhave not observed that beastliness, treachery, and parricide are the\r\ndirect way to happiness and comfort on earth.  And I should say, that if\r\nyou feel no motive to common morality but your fear of a criminal bar in\r\nheaven, you are decidedly a man for the police on earth to keep their eye\r\nupon, since it is matter of world-old experience that fear of distant\r\nconsequences is a very insufficient barrier against the rush of immediate\r\ndesire.  Fear of consequences is only one form of egoism, which will\r\nhardly stand against half a dozen other forms of egoism bearing down upon\r\nit.  And in opposition to your theory that a belief in immortality is the\r\nonly source of virtue, I maintain that, so far as moral action is\r\ndependent on that belief, so far the emotion which prompts it is not\r\ntruly moral—is still in the stage of egoism, and has not yet attained the\r\nhigher development of sympathy.  In proportion as a man would care less\r\nfor the rights and welfare of his fellow, if he did not believe in a\r\nfuture life, in that proportion is he wanting in the genuine feelings of\r\njustice and benevolence; as the musician who would care less to play a\r\nsonata of Beethoven’s finely in solitude than in public, where he was to\r\nbe paid for it, is wanting in genuine enthusiasm for music.”\r\n\r\nThus far might answer the man who “denies himself immortal;” and,\r\nallowing for that deficient recognition of the finer and more indirect\r\ninfluences exercised by the idea of immortality which might be expected\r\nfrom one who took up a dogmatic position on such a subject, we think he\r\nwould have given a sufficient reply to Young and other theological\r\nadvocates who, like him, pique themselves on the loftiness of their\r\ndoctrine when they maintain that “virtue with immortality expires.”  We\r\nmay admit, indeed, that if the better part of virtue consists, as Young\r\nappears to think, in contempt for mortal joys, in “meditation of our own\r\ndecease,” and in “applause” of God in the style of a congratulatory\r\naddress to Her Majesty—all which has small relation to the well-being of\r\nmankind on this earth—the motive to it must be gathered from something\r\nthat lies quite outside the sphere of human sympathy.  But, for certain\r\nother elements of virtue, which are of more obvious importance to\r\nuntheological minds—a delicate sense of our neighbor’s rights, an active\r\nparticipation in the joys and sorrows of our fellow-men, a magnanimous\r\nacceptance of privation or suffering for ourselves when it is the\r\ncondition of good to others, in a word, the extension and intensification\r\nof our sympathetic nature—we think it of some importance to contend that\r\nthey have no more direct relation to the belief in a future state than\r\nthe interchange of gases in the lungs has to the plurality of worlds.\r\nNay, to us it is conceivable that in some minds the deep pathos lying in\r\nthe thought of human mortality—that we are here for a little while and\r\nthen vanish away, that this earthly life is all that is given to our\r\nloved ones and to our many suffering fellow-men—lies nearer the fountains\r\nof moral emotion than the conception of extended existence.  And surely\r\nit ought to be a welcome fact, if the thought of _mortality_, as well as\r\nof immortality, be favorable to virtue.  Do writers of sermons and\r\nreligious novels prefer that men should be vicious in order that there\r\nmay be a more evident political and social necessity for printed sermons\r\nand clerical fictions?  Because learned gentlemen are theological, are we\r\nto have no more simple honesty and good-will?  We can imagine that the\r\nproprietors of a patent water-supply have a dread of common springs; but,\r\nfor our own part, we think there cannot be too great a security against a\r\nlack of fresh water or of pure morality.  To us it is a matter of unmixed\r\nrejoicing that this latter necessary of healthful life is independent of\r\ntheological ink, and that its evolution is insured in the interaction of\r\nhuman souls as certainly as the evolution of science or of art, with\r\nwhich, indeed, it is but a twin ray, melting into them with undefinable\r\nlimits.\r\n\r\nTo return to Young.  We can often detect a man’s deficiencies in what he\r\nadmires more clearly than in what he contemns—in the sentiments he\r\npresents as laudable rather than in those he decries.  And in Young’s\r\nnotion of what is lofty he casts a shadow by which we can measure him\r\nwithout further trouble.  For example, in arguing for human immortality,\r\nhe says:\r\n\r\n    “First, what is _true ambition_?  The pursuit\r\n    Of glory _nothing less than man can share_.\r\n\r\n    * * * *\r\n\r\n    The Visible and Present are for brutes,\r\n    A slender portion, and a narrow bound!\r\n    These Reason, with an energy divine,\r\n    O’erleaps, and claims the Future and Unseen;\r\n    The vast Unseen, the Future fathomless!\r\n    When the great soul buoys up to this high point,\r\n    Leaving gross Nature’s sediments below,\r\n    Then, and then only, Adam’s offspring quits\r\n    The sage and hero of the fields and woods,\r\n    Asserts his rank, and rises into man.”\r\n\r\nSo, then, if it were certified that, as some benevolent minds have tried\r\nto infer, our dumb fellow-creatures would share a future existence, in\r\nwhich it is to be hoped we should neither beat, starve, nor maim them,\r\nour ambition for a future life would cease to be “lofty!”  This is a\r\nnotion of loftiness which may pair off with Dr. Whewell’s celebrated\r\nobservation, that Bentham’s moral theory is low because it includes\r\njustice and mercy to brutes.\r\n\r\nBut, for a reflection of Young’s moral personality on a colossal scale,\r\nwe must turn to those passages where his rhetoric is at its utmost\r\nstretch of inflation—where he addresses the Deity, discourses of the\r\nDivine operations, or describes the last judgment.  As a compound of\r\nvulgar pomp, crawling adulation, and hard selfishness, presented under\r\nthe guise of piety, there are few things in literature to surpass the\r\nNinth Night, entitled “Consolation,” especially in the pages where he\r\ndescribes the last judgment—a subject to which, with naïve self-betrayal,\r\nhe applies phraseology, favored by the exuberant penny-a-liner.  Thus,\r\nwhen God descends, and the groans of hell are opposed by “shouts of joy,”\r\nmuch as cheers and groans contend at a public meeting where the\r\nresolutions are _not_ passed unanimously, the poet completes his climax\r\nin this way:\r\n\r\n    “Hence, in one peal of loud, eternal praise,\r\n    The _charmed spectators_ thunder their applause.”\r\n\r\nIn the same taste he sings:\r\n\r\n    “Eternity, the various sentence past,\r\n    Assigns the sever’d throng distinct abodes,\r\n    _Sulphureous_ or _ambrosial_.”\r\n\r\nExquisite delicacy of indication!  He is too nice to be specific as to\r\nthe interior of the “sulphureous” abode; but when once half the human\r\nrace are shut up there, hear how he enjoys turning the key on them!\r\n\r\n             “What ensues?\r\n    The deed predominant, the deed of deeds!\r\n    Which makes a hell of hell, a _heaven of heaven_!\r\n    The goddess, with determin’d aspect turns\r\n    Her adamantine key’s enormous size\r\n    Through Destiny’s inextricable wards,\r\n    _Deep driving every bolt_ on both their fates.\r\n    Then, from the crystal battlements of heaven,\r\n    Down, down she hurls it through the dark profound,\r\n    Ten thousand, thousand fathom; there to rust\r\n    And ne’er unlock her resolution more.\r\n    The deep resounds; and Hell, through all her glooms,\r\n    Returns, in groans, the melancholy roar.”\r\n\r\nThis is one of the blessings for which Dr. Young thanks God “most:”\r\n\r\n       “For all I bless thee, most, for the severe;\r\n    Her death—my own at hand—_the fiery gulf_,\r\n    _That flaming bound of wrath omnipotent_!\r\n    _It thunders_;—_but it thunders to preserve_;\r\n    . . . its wholesome dread\r\n    Averts the dreaded pain; _its hideous groans_\r\n    _Join Heaven’s sweet Hallelujahs in Thy praise_,\r\n    Great Source of good alone!  How kind in all!\r\n    In vengeance kind!  Pain, Death, Gehenna, _save_” . . .\r\n\r\n_i.e._, save _me_, Dr. Young, who, in return for that favor, promise to\r\ngive my divine patron the monopoly of that exuberance in laudatory\r\nepithet, of which specimens may be seen at any moment in a large number\r\nof dedications and odes to kings, queens, prime ministers, and other\r\npersons of distinction.  _That_, in Young’s conception, is what God\r\ndelights in.  His crowning aim in the “drama” of the ages, is to\r\nvindicate his own renown.  The God of the “Night Thoughts” is simply\r\nYoung himself “writ large”—a didactic poet, who “lectures” mankind in the\r\nantithetic hyperbole of mortal and immortal joys, earth and the stars,\r\nhell and heaven; and expects the tribute of inexhaustible “applause.”\r\nYoung has no conception of religion as anything else than egoism turned\r\nheavenward; and he does not merely imply this, he insists on it.\r\nReligion, he tells us, in argumentative passages too long to quote, is\r\n“ambition, pleasure, and the love of gain,” directed toward the joys of\r\nthe future life instead of the present.  And his ethics correspond to his\r\nreligion.  He vacillates, indeed, in his ethical theory, and shifts his\r\nposition in order to suit his immediate purpose in argument; but he never\r\nchanges his level so as to see beyond the horizon of mere selfishness.\r\nSometimes he insists, as we have seen, that the belief in a future life\r\nis the only basis of morality; but elsewhere he tells us—\r\n\r\n    “In self-applause is virtue’s golden prize.”\r\n\r\nVirtue, with Young, must always squint—must never look straight toward\r\nthe immediate object of its emotion and effort.  Thus, if a man risks\r\nperishing in the snow himself rather than forsake a weaker comrade, he\r\nmust either do this because his hopes and fears are directed to another\r\nworld, or because he desires to applaud himself afterward!  Young, if we\r\nmay believe him, would despise the action as folly unless it had these\r\nmotives.  Let us hope he was not so bad as he pretended to be!  The tides\r\nof the divine life in man move under the thickest ice of theory.\r\n\r\nAnother indication of Young’s deficiency in moral, _i.e._, in sympathetic\r\nemotion, is his unintermitting habit of pedagogic moralizing.  On its\r\ntheoretic and perceptive side, morality touches science; on its emotional\r\nside, Art.  Now, the products of Art are great in proportion as they\r\nresult from that immediate prompting of innate power which we call\r\nGenius, and not from labored obedience to a theory or rule; and the\r\npresence of genius or innate prompting is directly opposed to the\r\nperpetual consciousness of a rule.  The action of faculty is imperious,\r\nand excludes the reflection _why_ it should act.  In the same way, in\r\nproportion as morality is emotional, _i.e._, has affinity with Art, it\r\nwill exhibit itself in direct sympathetic feeling and action, and not as\r\nthe recognition of a rule.  Love does not say, “I ought to love”—it\r\nloves.  Pity does not say, “It is right to be pitiful”—it pities.\r\nJustice does not say, “I am bound to be just”—it feels justly.  It is\r\nonly where moral emotion is comparatively weak that the contemplation of\r\na rule or theory habitually mingles with its action; and in accordance\r\nwith this, we think experience, both in literature and life, has shown\r\nthat the minds which are pre-eminently didactic—which insist on a\r\n“lesson,” and despise everything that will not convey a moral, are\r\ndeficient in sympathetic emotion.  A certain poet is recorded to have\r\nsaid that he “wished everything of his burned that did not impress some\r\nmoral; even in love-verses, it might be flung in by the way.”  What poet\r\nwas it who took this medicinal view of poetry?  Dr. Watts, or James\r\nMontgomery, or some other singer of spotless life and ardent piety?  Not\r\nat all.  It was _Waller_.  A significant fact in relation to our\r\nposition, that the predominant didactic tendency proceeds rather from the\r\npoet’s perception that it is good for other men to be moral, than from\r\nany overflow of moral feeling in himself.  A man who is perpetually\r\nthinking in apothegms, who has an unintermittent flux of admonition, can\r\nhave little energy left for simple emotion.  And this is the case with\r\nYoung.  In his highest flights of contemplation and his most wailing\r\nsoliloquies he interrupts himself to fling an admonitory parenthesis at\r\n“Lorenzo,” or to hint that “folly’s creed” is the reverse of his own.\r\nBefore his thoughts can flow, he must fix his eye on an imaginary\r\nmiscreant, who gives unlimited scope for lecturing, and recriminates just\r\nenough to keep the spring of admonition and argument going to the extent\r\nof nine books.  It is curious to see how this pedagogic habit of mind\r\nruns through Young’s contemplation of Nature.  As the tendency to see our\r\nown sadness reflected in the external world has been called by Mr. Ruskin\r\nthe “pathetic fallacy,” so we may call Young’s disposition to see a\r\nrebuke or a warning in every natural object, the “pedagogic fallacy.”  To\r\nhis mind, the heavens are “forever _scolding_ as they shine;” and the\r\ngreat function of the stars is to be a “lecture to mankind.”  The\r\nconception of the Deity as a didactic author is not merely an implicit\r\npoint of view with him; he works it out in elaborate imagery, and at\r\nlength makes it the occasion of his most extraordinary achievement in the\r\n“art of sinking,” by exclaiming, _à propos_, we need hardly say, of the\r\nnocturnal heavens,\r\n\r\n    “Divine Instructor!  Thy first volume this\r\n    For man’s perusal! all in CAPITALS!”\r\n\r\nIt is this pedagogic tendency, this sermonizing attitude of Young’s mind,\r\nwhich produces the wearisome monotony of his pauses.  After the first two\r\nor three nights he is rarely singing, rarely pouring forth any continuous\r\nmelody inspired by the spontaneous flow of thought or feeling.  He is\r\nrather occupied with argumentative insistence, with hammering in the\r\nproofs of his propositions by disconnected verses, which he puts down at\r\nintervals.  The perpetual recurrence of the pause at the end of the line\r\nthroughout long passages makes them as fatiguing to the ear as a\r\nmonotonous chant, which consists of the endless repetition of one short\r\nmusical phrase.  For example:\r\n\r\n                “Past hours,\r\n    If not by guilt, yet wound us by their flight,\r\n    If folly bound our prospect by the grave,\r\n    All feeling of futurity be numb’d,\r\n    All godlike passion for eternals quench’d,\r\n    All relish of realities expired;\r\n    Renounced all correspondence with the skies;\r\n    Our freedom chain’d; quite wingless our desire;\r\n    In sense dark-prison’d all that ought to soar;\r\n    Prone to the centre; crawling in the dust;\r\n    Dismounted every great and glorious aim;\r\n    Enthralled every faculty divine,\r\n    Heart-buried in the rubbish of the world.”\r\n\r\nHow different from the easy, graceful melody of Cowper’s blank verse!\r\nIndeed, it is hardly possible to criticise Young without being reminded\r\nat every step of the contrast presented to him by Cowper.  And this\r\ncontrast urges itself upon us the more from the fact that there is, to a\r\ncertain extent, a parallelism between the “Night Thoughts” and the\r\n“Task.”  In both poems the author achieves his greatest in virtue of the\r\nnew freedom conferred by blank verse; both poems are professionally\r\ndidactic, and mingle much satire with their graver meditations; both\r\npoems are the productions of men whose estimate of this life was formed\r\nby the light of a belief in immortality, and who were intensely attached\r\nto Christianity.  On some grounds we might have anticipated a more morbid\r\nview of things from Cowper than from Young.  Cowper’s religion was\r\ndogmatically the more gloomy, for he was a Calvinist; while Young was a\r\n“low” Arminian, believing that Christ died for all, and that the only\r\nobstacle to any man’s salvation lay in his will, which he could change if\r\nhe chose.  There was real and deep sadness involved in Cowper’s personal\r\nlot; while Young, apart from his ambitious and greedy discontent, seems\r\nto have had no great sorrow.\r\n\r\nYet, see how a lovely, sympathetic nature manifests itself in spite of\r\ncreed and circumstance!  Where is the poem that surpasses the “Task” in\r\nthe genuine love it breathes, at once toward inanimate and animate\r\nexistence—in truthfulness of perception and sincerity of presentation—in\r\nthe calm gladness that springs from a delight in objects for their own\r\nsake, without self-reference—in divine sympathy with the lowliest\r\npleasures, with the most short-lived capacity for pain?  Here is no\r\nrailing at the earth’s “melancholy map,” but the happiest lingering over\r\nher simplest scenes with all the fond minuteness of attention that\r\nbelongs to love; no pompous rhetoric about the inferiority of the\r\n“brutes,” but a warm plea on their behalf against man’s inconsiderateness\r\nand cruelty, and a sense of enlarged happiness from their companionship\r\nin enjoyment; no vague rant about human misery and human virtue, but that\r\nclose and vivid presentation of particular sorrows and privations, of\r\nparticular deeds and misdeeds, which is the direct road to the emotions.\r\nHow Cowper’s exquisite mind falls with the mild warmth of morning\r\nsunlight on the commonest objects, at once disclosing every detail, and\r\ninvesting every detail with beauty!  No object is too small to prompt his\r\nsong—not the sooty film on the bars, or the spoutless teapot holding a\r\nbit of mignonette that serves to cheer the dingy town-lodging with a\r\n“hint that Nature lives;” and yet his song is never trivial, for he is\r\nalive to small objects, not because his mind is narrow, but because his\r\nglance is clear and his heart is large.  Instead of trying to edify us by\r\nsupercilious allusions to the “brutes” and the “stalls,” he interests us\r\nin that tragedy of the hen-roost when the thief has wrenched the door,\r\n\r\n    “Where Chanticleer amidst his harem sleeps\r\n    _In unsuspecting pomp_;”\r\n\r\nin the patient cattle, that on the winter’s morning\r\n\r\n       “Mourn in corners where the fence\r\n    Screens them, and seem half petrified to sleep\r\n    _In unrecumbent sadness_;”\r\n\r\nin the little squirrel, that, surprised by him in his woodland walk,\r\n\r\n             “At once, swift as a bird,\r\n    Ascends the neighboring beech; there whisks his brush,\r\n    And perks his ears, and stamps, and cries aloud,\r\n    With all the prettiness of feign’d alarm\r\n    And anger insignificantly fierce.”\r\n\r\nAnd then he passes into reflection, not with curt apothegm and snappish\r\nreproof, but with that melodious flow of utterance which belongs to\r\nthought when it is carried along in a stream of feeling:\r\n\r\n    “The heart is hard in nature, and unfit\r\n    For human fellowship, as being void\r\n    Of sympathy, and therefore dead alike\r\n    To love and friendship both, that is not pleased\r\n    With sight of animals enjoying life,\r\n    Nor feels their happiness augment his own.”\r\n\r\nHis large and tender heart embraces the most every-day forms of human\r\nlife—the carter driving his team through the wintry storm; the cottager’s\r\nwife who, painfully nursing the embers on her hearth, while her infants\r\n“sit cowering o’er the sparks,”\r\n\r\n    “Retires, content to quake, so they be warm’d;”\r\n\r\nor the villager, with her little ones, going out to pick\r\n\r\n    “A cheap but wholesome salad from the brook;”\r\n\r\nand he compels our colder natures to follow his in its manifold\r\nsympathies, not by exhortations, not by telling us to meditate at\r\nmidnight, to “indulge” the thought of death, or to ask ourselves how we\r\nshall “weather an eternal night,” _but by presenting to us the object of\r\nhis compassion truthfully and lovingly_.  And when he handles greater\r\nthemes, when he takes a wider survey, and considers the men or the deeds\r\nwhich have a direct influence on the welfare of communities and nations,\r\nthere is the same unselfish warmth of feeling, the same scrupulous\r\ntruthfulness.  He is never vague in his remonstrance or his satire, but\r\nputs his finger on some particular vice or folly which excites his\r\nindignation or “dissolves his heart in pity,” because of some specific\r\ninjury it does to his fellow-man or to a sacred cause.  And when he is\r\nasked why he interests himself about the sorrows and wrongs of others,\r\nhear what is the reason he gives.  Not, like Young, that the movements of\r\nthe planets show a mutual dependence, and that\r\n\r\n    “Thus man his sovereign duty learns in this\r\n    Material picture of benevolence,”\r\n\r\nor that—\r\n\r\n    “More generous sorrow, while it sinks, exalts,\r\n    And conscious virtue mitigates the pang.”\r\n\r\nWhat is Cowper’s answer, when he imagines some “sage, erudite, profound,”\r\nasking him “What’s the world to you?”\r\n\r\n    “Much.  _I was born of woman_, _and drew milk_\r\n    _As sweet as charity from human breasts_.\r\n    I think, articulate, I laugh and weep,\r\n    And exercise all functions of a man.\r\n    How then should I and any man that lives\r\n    Be strangers to each other?”\r\n\r\nYoung is astonished that men can make war on each other—that any one can\r\n“seize his brother’s throat,” while\r\n\r\n    “The Planets cry, ‘Forbear.’”\r\n\r\nCowper weeps because\r\n\r\n    “There is no flesh in man’s obdurate heart:\r\n    _It does not feel for man_.”\r\n\r\nYoung applauds God as a monarch with an empire and a court quite superior\r\nto the English, or as an author who produces “volumes for man’s perusal.”\r\nCowper sees his father’s love in all the gentle pleasures of the home\r\nfireside, in the charms even of the wintry landscape, and thinks—\r\n\r\n    “Happy who walks with him! whom what he finds\r\n    Of flavor or of scent in fruit or flower,\r\n    Or what he views of beautiful or grand\r\n    In nature, from the broad, majestic oak\r\n    To the green blade that twinkles in the sun,\r\n    _Prompts with remembrance of a present God_.”\r\n\r\nTo conclude—for we must arrest ourselves in a contrast that would lead us\r\nbeyond our bounds.  Young flies for his utmost consolation to the day of\r\njudgment, when\r\n\r\n             “Final Ruin fiercely drives\r\n    Her ploughshare o’er creation;”\r\n\r\nwhen earth, stars, and sun are swept aside,\r\n\r\n    “And now, all dross removed, Heaven’s own pure day,\r\n    Full on the confines of our ether, flames:\r\n    While (dreadful contrast!) far (how far!) beneath,\r\n    Hell, bursting, belches forth her blazing seas,\r\n    And storms suphureous; her voracious jaws\r\n    Expanding wide, and roaring for her prey,”\r\n\r\nDr. Young and similar “ornaments of religion and virtue” passing of\r\ncourse with grateful “applause” into the upper region.  Cowper finds his\r\nhighest inspiration in the Millennium—in the restoration of this our\r\nbeloved home of earth to perfect holiness and bliss, when the Supreme\r\n\r\n    “Shall visit earth in mercy; shall descend\r\n    Propitious in his chariot paved with love;\r\n    And what his storms have blasted and defaced\r\n    For man’s revolt, shall with a smile repair.”\r\n\r\nAnd into what delicious melody his song flows at the thought of that\r\nblessedness to be enjoyed by future generations on earth!\r\n\r\n    “The dwellers in the vales and on the rocks\r\n    Shout to each other, and the mountains tops\r\n    From distant mountains catch the flying joy;\r\n    Till, nation after nation taught the strain,\r\n    Earth rolls the rapturous Hosanna round!”\r\n\r\nThe sum of our comparison is this: In Young we have the type of that\r\ndeficient human sympathy, that impiety toward the present and the\r\nvisible, which flies for its motives, its sanctities, and its religion,\r\nto the remote, the vague, and the unknown: in Cowper we have the type of\r\nthat genuine love which cherishes things in proportion to their nearness,\r\nand feels its reverence grow in proportion to the intimacy of its\r\nknowledge.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nVIII.  THE INFLUENCE OF RATIONALISM. {257}\r\n\r\n\r\nThere is a valuable class of books on great subjects which have something\r\nof the character and functions of good popular lecturing.  They are not\r\noriginal, not subtle, not of close logical texture, not exquisite either\r\nin thought or style; but by virtue of these negatives they are all the\r\nmore fit to act on the average intelligence.  They have enough of\r\norganizing purpose in them to make their facts illustrative, and to leave\r\na distinct result in the mind even when most of the facts are forgotten;\r\nand they have enough of vagueness and vacillation in their theory to win\r\nthem ready acceptance from a mixed audience.  The vagueness and\r\nvacillation are not devices of timidity; they are the honest result of\r\nthe writer’s own mental character, which adapts him to be the instructor\r\nand the favorite of “the general reader.”  For the most part, the general\r\nreader of the present day does not exactly know what distance he goes; he\r\nonly knows that he does not go “too far.”  Of any remarkable thinker,\r\nwhose writings have excited controversy, he likes to have it said that\r\n“his errors are to be deplored,” leaving it not too certain what those\r\nerrors are; he is fond of what may be called disembodied opinions, that\r\nfloat in vapory phrases above all systems of thought or action; he likes\r\nan undefined Christianity which opposes itself to nothing in particular,\r\nan undefined education of the people, an undefined amelioration of all\r\nthings: in fact, he likes sound views—nothing extreme, but something\r\nbetween the excesses of the past and the excesses of the present.  This\r\nmodern type of the general reader may be known in conversation by the\r\ncordiality with which he assents to indistinct, blurred statements: say\r\nthat black is black, he will shake his head and hardly think it; say that\r\nblack is not so very black, he will reply, “Exactly.”  He has no\r\nhesitation, if you wish it, even to get up at a public meeting and\r\nexpress his conviction that at times, and within certain limits, the\r\nradii of a circle have a tendency to be equal; but, on the other hand, he\r\nwould urge that the spirit of geometry may be carried a little too far.\r\nHis only bigotry is a bigotry against any clearly defined opinion; not in\r\nthe least based on a scientific scepticism, but belonging to a lack of\r\ncoherent thought—a spongy texture of mind, that gravitates strongly to\r\nnothing.  The one thing he is staunch for is, the utmost liberty of\r\nprivate haziness.\r\n\r\nBut precisely these characteristics of the general reader, rendering him\r\nincapable of assimilating ideas unless they are administered in a highly\r\ndiluted form, make it a matter of rejoicing that there are clever,\r\nfair-minded men, who will write books for him—men very much above him in\r\nknowledge and ability, but not too remote from him in their habits of\r\nthinking, and who can thus prepare for him infusions of history and\r\nscience that will leave some solidifying deposit, and save him from a\r\nfatal softening of the intellectual skeleton.  Among such serviceable\r\nwriters, Mr. Lecky’s “History of the Rise and Influence of the Spirit of\r\nRationalism in Europe” entitles him to a high place.  He has prepared\r\nhimself for its production by an unusual amount of well-directed reading;\r\nhe has chosen his facts and quotations with much judgment; and he gives\r\nproof of those important moral qualifications, impartiality, seriousness,\r\nand modesty.  This praise is chiefly applicable to the long chapter on\r\nthe history of Magic and Witchcraft, which opens the work, and to the two\r\nchapters on the antecedents and history of Persecution, which occur, the\r\none at the end of the first volume, the other at the beginning of the\r\nsecond.  In these chapters Mr. Lecky has a narrower and better-traced\r\npath before him than in other portions of his work; he is more occupied\r\nwith presenting a particular class of facts in their historical sequence,\r\nand in their relation to certain grand tide-marks of opinion, than with\r\ndisquisition; and his writing is freer than elsewhere from an apparent\r\nconfusedness of thought and an exuberance of approximative phrases, which\r\ncan be serviceable in no other way than as diluents needful for the sort\r\nof reader we have just described.\r\n\r\nThe history of magic and witchcraft has been judiciously chosen by Mr.\r\nLecky as the subject of his first section on the Declining Sense of the\r\nMiraculous, because it is strikingly illustrative of a position with the\r\ntruth of which he is strongly impressed, though he does not always treat\r\nof it with desirable clearness and precision, namely, that certain\r\nbeliefs become obsolete, not in consequence of direct arguments against\r\nthem, but because of their incongruity with prevalent habits of thought.\r\nHere is his statement of the two “classes of influences” by which the\r\nmass of men, in what is called civilized society, get their beliefs\r\ngradually modified:\r\n\r\n    “If we ask why it is that the world has rejected what was once so\r\n    universally and so intensely believed, why a narrative of an old\r\n    woman who had been seen riding on a broomstick, or who was proved to\r\n    have transformed herself into a wolf, and to have devoured the flocks\r\n    of her neighbors, is deemed so entirely incredible, most persons\r\n    would probably be unable to give a very definite answer to the\r\n    question.  It is not because we have examined the evidence and found\r\n    it insufficient, for the disbelief always precedes, when it does not\r\n    prevent, examination.  It is rather because the idea of absurdity is\r\n    so strongly attached to such narratives, that it is difficult even to\r\n    consider them with gravity.  Yet at one time no such improbability\r\n    was felt, and hundreds of persons have been burnt simply on the two\r\n    grounds I have mentioned.\r\n\r\n    “When so complete a change takes place in public opinion, it may be\r\n    ascribed to one or other of two causes.  It may be the result of a\r\n    controversy which has conclusively settled the question, establishing\r\n    to the satisfaction of all parties a clear preponderance of argument\r\n    or fact in favor of one opinion, and making that opinion a truism\r\n    which is accepted by all enlightened men, even though they have not\r\n    themselves examined the evidence on which it rests.  Thus, if any one\r\n    in a company of ordinarily educated persons were to deny the motion\r\n    of the earth, or the circulation of the blood, his statement would be\r\n    received with derision, though it is probable that some of his\r\n    audience would be unable to demonstrate the first truth, and that\r\n    very few of them could give sufficient reasons for the second.  They\r\n    may not themselves be able to defend their position; but they are\r\n    aware that, at certain known periods of history, controversies on\r\n    those subjects took place, and that known writers then brought\r\n    forward some definite arguments or experiments, which were ultimately\r\n    accepted by the whole learned world as rigid and conclusive\r\n    demonstrations.  It is possible, also, for as complete a change to be\r\n    effected by what is called the spirit of the age.  The general\r\n    intellectual tendencies pervading the literature of a century\r\n    profoundly modify the character of the public mind.  They form a new\r\n    tone and habit of thought.  They alter the measure of probability.\r\n    They create new attractions and new antipathies, and they eventually\r\n    cause as absolute a rejection of certain old opinions as could be\r\n    produced by the most cogent and definite arguments.”\r\n\r\nMr. Lecky proceeds to some questionable views concerning the evidences of\r\nwitchcraft, which seem to be irreconcilable even with his own remarks\r\nlater on; but they lead him to the statement, thoroughly made out by his\r\nhistorical survey, that “movement was mainly silent, unargumentative, and\r\ninsensible; that men came gradually to disbelieve in witchcraft, because\r\nthey came gradually to look upon it as absurd; and that this new tone of\r\nthought appeared, first of all, in those who were least subject to\r\ntheological influences, and soon spread through the educated laity, and,\r\nlast of all, took possession of the clergy.”\r\n\r\nWe have rather painful proof that this “second class of influences,” with\r\na vast number go hardly deeper than Fashion, and that witchcraft to many\r\nof us is absurd only on the same ground that our grandfathers’ gigs are\r\nabsurd.  It is felt preposterous to think of spiritual agencies in\r\nconnection with ragged beldames soaring on broomsticks, in an age when it\r\nis known that mediums of communication with the invisible world are\r\nusually unctuous personages dressed in excellent broadcloth, who soar\r\nabove the curtain-poles without any broomstick, and who are not given to\r\nunprofitable intrigues.  The enlightened imagination rejects the figure\r\nof a witch with her profile in dark relief against the moon and her\r\nbroomstick cutting a constellation.  No undiscovered natural laws, no\r\nnames of “respectable” witnesses, are invoked to make us feel our\r\npresumption in questioning the diabolic intimacies of that obsolete old\r\nwoman, for it is known now that the undiscovered laws, and the witnesses\r\nqualified by the payment of income tax, are all in favor of a different\r\nconception—the image of a heavy gentleman in boots and black coat-tails\r\nforeshortened against the cornice.  Yet no less a person than Sir Thomas\r\nBrowne once wrote that those who denied there were witches, inasmuch as\r\nthey thereby denied spirits also, were “obliquely and upon consequence a\r\nsort, not of infidels, but of atheists.”  At present, doubtless, in\r\ncertain circles, unbelievers in heavy gentlemen who float in the air by\r\nmeans of undiscovered laws are also taxed with atheism; illiberal as it\r\nis not to admit that mere weakness of understanding may prevent one from\r\nseeing how that phenomenon is necessarily involved in the Divine origin\r\nof things.  With still more remarkable parallelism, Sir Thomas Browne\r\ngoes on: “Those that, to refute their incredulity, desire to see\r\napparitions, shall questionless never behold any, nor have the power to\r\nbe so much as witches.  The devil hath made them already in a heresy as\r\ncapital as witchcraft, _and to appear to them were but to convert them_.”\r\nIt would be difficult to see what has been changed here, but the mere\r\ndrapery of circumstance, if it were not for this prominent difference\r\nbetween our own days and the days of witchcraft, that instead of\r\ntorturing, drowning, or burning the innocent, we give hospitality and\r\nlarge pay to—the highly distinguished medium.  At least we are safely rid\r\nof certain horrors; but if the multitude—that “farraginous concurrence of\r\nall conditions, tempers, sexes, and ages”—do not roll back even to a\r\nsuperstition that carries cruelty in its train, it is not because they\r\npossess a cultivated reason, but because they are pressed upon and held\r\nup by what we may call an external reason—the sum of conditions resulting\r\nfrom the laws of material growth, from changes produced by great\r\nhistorical collisions shattering the structures of ages and making new\r\nhighways for events and ideas, and from the activities of higher minds no\r\nlonger existing merely as opinions and teaching, but as institutions and\r\norganizations with which the interests, the affections, and the habits of\r\nthe multitude are inextricably interwoven.  No undiscovered laws\r\naccounting for small phenomena going forward under drawing-room tables\r\nare likely to affect the tremendous facts of the increase of population,\r\nthe rejection of convicts by our colonies, the exhaustion of the soil by\r\ncotton plantations, which urge even upon the foolish certain questions,\r\ncertain claims, certain views concerning the scheme of the world, that\r\ncan never again be silenced.  If right reason is a right representation\r\nof the co-existence and sequences of things, here are co-existences and\r\nsequences that do not wait to be discovered, but press themselves upon us\r\nlike bars of iron.  No séances at a guinea a head for the sake of being\r\npinched by “Mary Jane” can annihilate railways, steamships, and electric\r\ntelegraphs, which are demonstrating the interdependence of all human\r\ninterests, and making self-interest a duct for sympathy.  These things\r\nare part of the external Reason to which internal silliness has\r\ninevitably to accommodate itself.\r\n\r\nThree points in the history of magic and witchcraft are well brought out\r\nby Mr. Lecky.  First, that the cruelties connected with it did not begin\r\nuntil men’s minds had ceased to repose implicitly in a sacramental system\r\nwhich made them feel well armed against evil spirits; that is, until the\r\neleventh century, when there came a sort of morning dream of doubt and\r\nheresy, bringing on the one side the terror of timid consciences, and on\r\nthe other the terrorism of authority or zeal bent on checking the rising\r\nstruggle.  In that time of comparative mental repose, says Mr. Lecky,\r\n\r\n    “All those conceptions of diabolical presence; all that\r\n    predisposition toward the miraculous, which acted so fearfully upon\r\n    the imaginations of the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries, existed;\r\n    but the implicit faith, the boundless and triumphant credulity with\r\n    which the virtue of ecclesiastical rites was accepted, rendered them\r\n    comparatively innocuous.  If men had been a little less\r\n    superstitious, the effects of their superstition would have been much\r\n    more terrible.  It was firmly believed that any one who deviated from\r\n    the strict line of orthodoxy must soon succumb beneath the power of\r\n    Satan; but as there was no spirit of rebellion or doubt, this\r\n    persuasion did not produce any extraordinary terrorism.”\r\n\r\nThe Church was disposed to confound heretical opinion with sorcery; false\r\ndoctrine was especially the devil’s work, and it was a ready conclusion\r\nthat a denier or innovator had held consultation with the father of lies.\r\nIt is a saying of a zealous Catholic in the sixteenth century, quoted by\r\nMaury in his excellent work, “De la Magie”—“_Crescit cum magia hæresis_,\r\n_cum hæresi magia_.”  Even those who doubted were terrified at their\r\ndoubts, for trust is more easily undermined than terror.  Fear is earlier\r\nborn than hope, lays a stronger grasp on man’s system than any other\r\npassion, and remains master of a larger group of involuntary actions.  A\r\nchief aspect of man’s moral development is the slow subduing of fear by\r\nthe gradual growth of intelligence, and its suppression as a motive by\r\nthe presence of impulses less animally selfish; so that in relation to\r\ninvisible Power, fear at last ceases to exist, save in that interfusion\r\nwith higher faculties which we call awe.\r\n\r\nSecondly, Mr. Lecky shows clearly that dogmatic Protestantism, holding\r\nthe vivid belief in Satanic agency to be an essential of piety, would\r\nhave felt it shame to be a whit behind Catholicism in severity against\r\nthe devil’s servants.  Luther’s sentiment was that he would not suffer a\r\nwitch to live (he was not much more merciful to Jews); and, in spite of\r\nhis fondness for children, believing a certain child to have been\r\nbegotten by the devil, he recommended the parents to throw it into the\r\nriver.  The torch must be turned on the worst errors of heroic minds—not\r\nin irreverent ingratitude, but for the sake of measuring our vast and\r\nvarious debt to all the influences which have concurred, in the\r\nintervening ages, to make us recognize as detestable errors the honest\r\nconvictions of men who, in mere individual capacity and moral force, were\r\nvery much above us.  Again, the Scotch Puritans, during the comparatively\r\nshort period of their ascendency, surpassed all Christians before them in\r\nthe elaborate ingenuity of the tortures they applied for the discovery of\r\nwitchcraft and sorcery, and did their utmost to prove that if Scotch\r\nCalvinism was the true religion, the chief “note” of the true religion\r\nwas cruelty.  It is hardly an endurable task to read the story of their\r\ndoings; thoroughly to imagine them as a past reality is already a sort of\r\ntorture.  One detail is enough, and it is a comparatively mild one.  It\r\nwas the regular profession of men called “prickers” to thrust long pins\r\ninto the body of a suspected witch in order to detect the insensible spot\r\nwhich was the infallible sign of her guilt.  On a superficial view one\r\nwould be in danger of saying that the main difference between the\r\nteachers who sanctioned these things and the much-despised ancestors who\r\noffered human victims inside a huge wicker idol, was that they arrived at\r\na more elaborate barbarity by a longer series of dependent propositions.\r\nWe do not share Mr. Buckle’s opinion that a Scotch minister’s groans were\r\na part of his deliberate plan for keeping the people in a state of\r\nterrified subjection; the ministers themselves held the belief they\r\ntaught, and might well groan over it.  What a blessing has a little false\r\nlogic been to the world!  Seeing that men are so slow to question their\r\npremises, they must have made each other much more miserable, if pity had\r\nnot sometimes drawn tender conclusions not warranted by Major and Minor;\r\nif there had not been people with an amiable imbecility of reasoning\r\nwhich enabled them at once to cling to hideous beliefs, and to be\r\nconscientiously inconsistent with them in their conduct.  There is\r\nnothing like acute deductive reasoning for keeping a man in the dark: it\r\nmight be called the _technique_ of the intellect, and the concentration\r\nof the mind upon it corresponds to that predominance of technical skill\r\nin art which ends in degradation of the artist’s function, unless new\r\ninspiration and invention come to guide it.\r\n\r\nAnd of this there is some good illustration furnished by that third node\r\nin the history of witchcraft, the beginning of its end, which is treated\r\nin an interesting manner by Mr. Lecky.  It is worth noticing, that the\r\nmost important defences of the belief in witchcraft, against the growing\r\nscepticism in the latter part of the sixteenth century and in the\r\nseventeenth, were the productions of men who in some departments were\r\namong the foremost thinkers of their time.  One of them was Jean Bodin,\r\nthe famous writer on government and jurisprudence, whose “Republic,”\r\nHallam thinks, had an important influence in England, and furnished “a\r\nstore of arguments and examples that were not lost on the thoughtful\r\nminds of our countrymen.”  In some of his views he was original and bold;\r\nfor example, he anticipated Montesquieu in attempting to appreciate the\r\nrelations of government and climate.  Hallam inclines to the opinion that\r\nhe was a Jew, and attached Divine authority only to the Old Testament.\r\nBut this was enough to furnish him with his chief data for the existence\r\nof witches and for their capital punishment; and in the account of his\r\n“Republic,” given by Hallam, there is enough evidence that the sagacity\r\nwhich often enabled him to make fine use of his learning was also often\r\nentangled in it, to temper our surprise at finding a writer on political\r\nscience of whom it could be said that, along with Montesquieu, he was\r\n“the most philosophical of those who had read so deeply, the most learned\r\nof those who had thought so much,” in the van of the forlorn hope to\r\nmaintain the reality of witchcraft.  It should be said that he was\r\nequally confident of the unreality of the Copernican hypothesis, on the\r\nground that it was contrary to the tenets of the theologians and\r\nphilosophers and to common-sense, and therefore subversive of the\r\nfoundations of every science.  Of his work on witchcraft, Mr. Lecky says:\r\n\r\n    “The ‘Démonomanie des Sorciers’ is chiefly an appeal to authority,\r\n    which the author deemed on this subject so unanimous and so\r\n    conclusive, that it was scarcely possible for any sane man to resist\r\n    it.  He appealed to the popular belief in all countries, in all ages,\r\n    and in all religions.  He cited the opinions of an immense multitude\r\n    of the greatest writers of pagan antiquity, and of the most\r\n    illustrious of the Fathers.  He showed how the laws of all nations\r\n    recognized the existence of witchcraft; and he collected hundreds of\r\n    cases which had been investigated before the tribunals of his own or\r\n    of other countries.  He relates with the most minute and\r\n    circumstantial detail, and with the most unfaltering confidence, all\r\n    the proceedings at the witches’ Sabbath, the methods which the\r\n    witches employed in transporting themselves through the air, their\r\n    transformations, their carnal intercourse with the devil, their\r\n    various means of injuring their enemies, the signs that lead to their\r\n    detection, their confessions when condemned, and their demeanor at\r\n    the stake.”\r\n\r\nSomething must be allowed for a lawyer’s affection toward a belief which\r\nhad furnished so many “cases.”  Bodin’s work had been immediately\r\nprompted by the treatise “De Prestigiis Dænionum,” written by John Wier,\r\na German physician, a treatise which is worth notice as an example of a\r\ntransitional form of opinion for which many analogies may be found in the\r\nhistory both of religion and science.  Wier believed in demons, and in\r\npossession by demons, but his practice as a physician had convinced him\r\nthat the so-called witches were patients and victims, that the devil took\r\nadvantage of their diseased condition to delude them, and that there was\r\nno consent of an evil will on the part of the women.  He argued that the\r\nword in Leviticus translated “witch” meant “poisoner,” and besought the\r\nprinces of Europe to hinder the further spilling of innocent blood.\r\nThese heresies of Wier threw Bodin into such a state of amazed\r\nindignation that if he had been an ancient Jew instead of a modern\r\neconomical one, he would have rent his garments.  “No one had ever heard\r\nof pardon being accorded to sorcerers;” and probably the reason why\r\nCharles IX. died young was because he had pardoned the sorcerer, Trios\r\nEchelles!  We must remember that this was in 1581, when the great\r\nscientific movement of the Renaissance had hardly begun—when Galileo was\r\na youth of seventeen, and Kepler a boy of ten.\r\n\r\nBut directly afterward, on the other side, came Montaigne, whose\r\nsceptical acuteness could arrive at negatives without any apparatus of\r\nmethod.  A certain keen narrowness of nature will secure a man from many\r\nabsurd beliefs which the larger soul, vibrating to more manifold\r\ninfluences, would have a long struggle to part with.  And so we find the\r\ncharming, chatty Montaigne—in one of the brightest of his essays, “Des\r\nBoiteux,” where he declares that, from his own observation of witches and\r\nsorcerers, he should have recommended them to be treated with curative\r\nhellebore—stating in his own way a pregnant doctrine, since taught more\r\ngravely.  It seems to him much less of a prodigy that men should lie, or\r\nthat their imaginations should deceive them, than that a human body\r\nshould be carried through the air on a broomstick, or up a chimney by\r\nsome unknown spirit.  He thinks it a sad business to persuade oneself\r\nthat the test of truth lies in the multitude of believers—“en une prosse\r\noù les fols surpassent de tant les sages en nombre.”  Ordinarily, he has\r\nobserved, when men have something stated to them as a fact, they are more\r\nready to explain it than to inquire whether it is real: “ils passent\r\npardessus les propositions, mais ils examinent les conséquences; _ils\r\nlaissent les choses_, _et courent aux causes_.”  There is a sort of\r\nstrong and generous ignorance which is as honorable and courageous as\r\nscience—“ignorance pour laquelle concevoir il n’y a pas moins de science\r\nqu’à concevoir la science.”  And _à propos_ of the immense traditional\r\nevidence which weighed with such men as Bodin, he says—“As for the proofs\r\nand arguments founded on experience and facts, I do not pretend to\r\nunravel these.  What end of a thread is there to lay hold of?  I often\r\ncut them as Alexander did his knot.  _Après tout_, _c’est mettre ses\r\nconjectures â bien haut prix_, _que d’en faire cuire un homme tout dif_.”\r\n\r\nWriting like this, when it finds eager readers, is a sign that the\r\nweather is changing; yet much later, namely, after 1665, when the Royal\r\nSociety had been founded, our own Glanvil, the author of the “Scepsis\r\nScientifica,” a work that was a remarkable advance toward the true\r\ndefinition of the limits of inquiry, and that won him his election as\r\nfellow of the society, published an energetic vindication of the belief\r\nin witchcraft, of which Mr. Lecky gives the following sketch:\r\n\r\n    “The ‘Sadducismus Triumphatus,’ which is probably the ablest book\r\n    ever published in defence of the superstition, opens with a striking\r\n    picture of the rapid progress of the scepticism in England.\r\n    Everywhere, a disbelief in witchcraft was becoming fashionable in the\r\n    upper classes; but it was a disbelief that arose entirely from a\r\n    strong sense of its antecedent improbability.  All who were opposed\r\n    to the orthodox faith united in discrediting witchcraft.  They\r\n    laughed at it, as palpably absurd, as involving the most grotesque\r\n    and ludicrous conceptions, as so essentially incredible that it would\r\n    be a waste of time to examine it.  This spirit had arisen since the\r\n    Restoration, although the laws were still in force, and although\r\n    little or no direct reasoning had been brought to bear upon the\r\n    subject.  In order to combat it, Glanvil proceeded to examine the\r\n    general question of the credibility of the miraculous.  He saw that\r\n    the reason why witchcraft was ridiculed was, because it was a phase\r\n    of the miraculous and the work of the devil; that the scepticism was\r\n    chiefly due to those who disbelieved in miracles and the devil; and\r\n    that the instances of witchcraft or possession in the Bible were\r\n    invariably placed on a level with those that were tried in the law\r\n    courts of England.  That the evidence of the belief was overwhelming,\r\n    he firmly believed; and this, indeed, was scarcely disputed; but,\r\n    until the sense of _à priori_ improbability was removed, no possible\r\n    accumulation of facts would cause men to believe it.  To that task he\r\n    accordingly addressed himself.  Anticipating the idea and almost the\r\n    words of modern controversialists, he urged that there was such a\r\n    thing as a credulity of unbelief; and that those who believed so\r\n    strange a concurrence of delusions, as was necessary on the\r\n    supposition of the unreality of witchcraft, were far more credulous\r\n    than those who accepted the belief.  He made his very scepticism his\r\n    principal weapon; and, analyzing with much acuteness the _à priori_\r\n    objections, he showed that they rested upon an unwarrantable\r\n    confidence in our knowledge of the laws of the spirit world; that\r\n    they implied the existence of some strict analogy between the\r\n    faculties of men and of spirits; and that, as such analogy most\r\n    probably did not exist, no reasoning based on the supposition could\r\n    dispense men from examining the evidence.  He concluded with a large\r\n    collection of cases, the evidence of which was, as he thought,\r\n    incontestable.”\r\n\r\nWe have quoted this sketch because Glanvil’s argument against the _à\r\npriori_ objection of absurdity is fatiguingly urged in relation to other\r\nalleged marvels which, to busy people seriously occupied with the\r\ndifficulties of affairs, of science, or of art, seem as little worthy of\r\nexamination as aëronautic broomsticks.  And also because we here see\r\nGlanvil, in combating an incredulity that does not happen to be his own,\r\nwielding that very argument of traditional evidence which he had made the\r\nsubject of vigorous attack in his “Scepsis Scientifica.”  But perhaps\r\nlarge minds have been peculiarly liable to this fluctuation concerning\r\nthe sphere of tradition, because, while they have attacked its\r\nmisapplications, they have been the more solicited by the vague sense\r\nthat tradition is really the basis of our best life.  Our sentiments may\r\nbe called organized traditions; and a large part of our actions gather\r\nall their justification, all their attraction and aroma, from the memory\r\nof the life lived, of the actions done, before we were born.  In the\r\nabsence of any profound research into psychological functions or into the\r\nmysteries of inheritance, in the absence of any comprehensive view of\r\nman’s historical development and the dependence of one age on another, a\r\nmind at all rich in sensibilities must always have had an indefinite\r\nuneasiness in an undistinguishing attack on the coercive influence of\r\ntradition.  And this may be the apology for the apparent inconsistency of\r\nGlanvil’s acute criticism on the one side, and his indignation at the\r\n“looser gentry,” who laughed at the evidences for witchcraft on the\r\nother.  We have already taken up too much space with this subject of\r\nwitchcraft, else we should be tempted to dwell on Sir Thomas Browne, who\r\nfar surpassed Glanvil in magnificent incongruity of opinion, and whose\r\nworks are the most remarkable combination existing, of witty sarcasm\r\nagainst ancient nonsense and modern obsequiousness, with indications of a\r\ncapacious credulity.  After all, we may be sharing what seems to us the\r\nhardness of these men, who sat in their studies and argued at their ease\r\nabout a belief that would be reckoned to have caused more misery and\r\nbloodshed than any other superstition, if there had been no such thing as\r\npersecution on the ground of religious opinion.\r\n\r\nOn this subject of Persecution, Mr. Lecky writes his best: with clearness\r\nof conception, with calm justice, bent on appreciating the necessary\r\ntendency of ideas, and with an appropriateness of illustration that could\r\nbe supplied only by extensive and intelligent reading.  Persecution, he\r\nshows, is not in any sense peculiar to the Catholic Church; it is a\r\ndirect sequence of the doctrines that salvation is to be had only within\r\nthe Church, and that erroneous belief is damnatory—doctrines held as\r\nfully by Protestant sects as by the Catholics; and in proportion to its\r\npower, Protestantism has been as persecuting as Catholicism.  He\r\nmaintains, in opposition to the favorite modern notion of persecution\r\ndefeating its own object, that the Church, holding the dogma of exclusive\r\nsalvation, was perfectly consequent, and really achieved its end of\r\nspreading one belief and quenching another, by calling in the aid of the\r\ncivil arm.  Who will say that governments, by their power over\r\ninstitutions and patronage, as well as over punishment, have not power\r\nalso over the interests and inclinations of men, and over most of those\r\nexternal conditions into which subjects are born, and which make them\r\nadopt the prevalent belief as a second nature?  Hence, to a sincere\r\nbeliever in the doctrine of exclusive salvation, governments had it in\r\ntheir power to save men from perdition; and wherever the clergy were at\r\nthe elbow of the civil arm, no matter whether they were Catholic or\r\nProtestant, persecution was the result.  “Compel them to come in” was a\r\nrule that seemed sanctioned by mercy, and the horrible sufferings it led\r\nmen to inflict seemed small to minds accustomed to contemplate, as a\r\nperpetual source of motive, the eternal unmitigated miseries of a hell\r\nthat was the inevitable destination of a majority among mankind.\r\n\r\nIt is a significant fact, noted by Mr. Lecky, that the only two leaders\r\nof the Reformation who advocated tolerance were Zuinglius and Socinus,\r\nboth of them disbelievers in exclusive salvation.  And in corroboration\r\nof other evidence that the chief triumphs of the Reformation were due to\r\ncoercion, he commends to the special attention of his readers the\r\nfollowing quotation from a work attributed without question to the famous\r\nProtestant theologian, Jurieu, who had himself been hindered, as a\r\nProtestant, from exercising his professional functions in France, and was\r\nsettled as pastor at Rotterdam.  It should be remembered that Jurieu’s\r\nlabors fell in the latter part of the seventeenth century and in the\r\nbeginning of the eighteenth, and that he was the contemporary of Bayle,\r\nwith whom he was in bitter controversial hostility.  He wrote, then, at a\r\ntime when there was warm debate on the question of Toleration; and it was\r\nhis great object to vindicate himself and his French fellow-Protestants\r\nfrom all laxity on this point.\r\n\r\n    “Peut on nier que le panganisme est tombé dans le monde par\r\n    l’autorité des empereurs Romains?  On peut assurer sans temerité que\r\n    le paganisme seroit encore debout, et que les trois quarts de\r\n    l’Europe seroient encore payens si Constantin et ses successeurs\r\n    n’avaient employé leur autorité pour l’abolir.  Mais, je vous prie,\r\n    de quelles voies Dieu s’est il servi dans ces derniers siècles pour\r\n    rétablir la veritable religion dans l’Occident?  _Les rois de Suède_,\r\n    _ceux de Danemarck_, _ceux d’Angleterre_, _les magistrats souverains\r\n    de Suisse_, _des Païs Bas_, _des villes livres d’Allemagne_, _les\r\n    princes électeurs_, _et autres princes souverains de l’empire_,\r\n    _n’ont ils pas emploié leur autorité pour abbattre le Papisme_?”\r\n\r\nIndeed, wherever the tremendous alternative of everlasting torments is\r\nbelieved in—believed in so that it becomes a motive determining the\r\nlife—not only persecution, but every other form of severity and gloom are\r\nthe legitimate consequences.  There is much ready declamation in these\r\ndays against the spirit of asceticism and against zeal for doctrinal\r\nconversion; but surely the macerated form of a Saint Francis, the fierce\r\ndenunciations of a Saint Dominic, the groans and prayerful wrestlings of\r\nthe Puritan who seasoned his bread with tears and made all pleasurable\r\nsensation sin, are more in keeping with the contemplation of unending\r\nanguish as the destiny of a vast multitude whose nature we share, than\r\nthe rubicund cheerfulness of some modern divines, who profess to unite a\r\nsmiling liberalism with a well-bred and tacit but unshaken confidence in\r\nthe reality of the bottomless pit.  But, in fact, as Mr. Lecky maintains,\r\nthat awful image, with its group of associated dogmas concerning the\r\ninherited curse, and the damnation of unbaptized infants, of heathens,\r\nand of heretics, has passed away from what he is fond of calling “the\r\nrealizations” of Christendom.  These things are no longer the objects of\r\npractical belief.  They may be mourned for in encyclical letters; bishops\r\nmay regret them; doctors of divinity may sign testimonials to the\r\nexcellent character of these decayed beliefs; but for the mass of\r\nChristians they are no more influential than unrepealed but forgotten\r\nstatutes.  And with these dogmas has melted away the strong basis for the\r\ndefence of persecution.  No man now writes eager vindications of himself\r\nand his colleagues from the suspicion of adhering to the principle of\r\ntoleration.  And this momentous change, it is Mr. Lecky’s object to show,\r\nis due to that concurrence of conditions which he has chosen to call “the\r\nadvance of the Spirit of Rationalism.”\r\n\r\nIn other parts of his work, where he attempts to trace the action of the\r\nsame conditions on the acceptance of miracles and on other chief phases\r\nof our historical development, Mr. Lecky has laid himself open to\r\nconsiderable criticism.  The chapters on the “Miracles of the Church,”\r\nthe æsthetic, scientific, and moral development of Rationalism, the\r\nSecularization of Politics, and the Industrial History of Rationalism,\r\nembrace a wide range of diligently gathered facts; but they are nowhere\r\nilluminated by a sufficiently clear conception and statement of the\r\nagencies at work, or the mode of their action, in the gradual\r\nmodification of opinion and of life.  The writer frequently impresses us\r\nas being in a state of hesitation concerning his own standing-point,\r\nwhich may form a desirable stage in private meditation but not in\r\npublished exposition.  Certain epochs in theoretic conception, certain\r\nconsiderations, which should be fundamental to his survey, are introduced\r\nquite incidentally in a sentence or two, or in a note which seems to be\r\nan afterthought.  Great writers and their ideas are touched upon too\r\nslightly and with too little discrimination, and important theories are\r\nsometimes characterized with a rashness which conscientious revision will\r\ncorrect.  There is a fatiguing use of vague or shifting phrases, such as\r\n“modern civilization,” “spirit of the age,” “tone of thought,”\r\n“intellectual type of the age,” “bias of the imagination,” “habits of\r\nreligious thought,” unbalanced by any precise definition; and the spirit\r\nof rationalism is sometimes treated of as if it lay outside the specific\r\nmental activities of which it is a generalized expression.  Mr. Curdle’s\r\nfamous definition of the dramatic unities as “a sort of a general\r\noneness,” is not totally false; but such luminousness as it has could\r\nonly be perceived by those who already knew what the unities were.  Mr.\r\nLecky has the advantage of being strongly impressed with the great part\r\nplayed by the emotions in the formation of opinion, and with the high\r\ncomplexity of the causes at work in social evolution; but he frequently\r\nwrites as if he had never yet distinguished between the complexity of the\r\nconditions that produce prevalent states of mind and the inability of\r\nparticular minds to give distinct reasons for the preferences or\r\npersuasions produced by those states.  In brief, he does not\r\ndiscriminate, or does not help his reader to discriminate, between\r\nobjective complexity and subjective confusion.  But the most\r\nmuddle-headed gentleman who represents the spirit of the age by\r\nobserving, as he settles his collar, that the development theory is quite\r\n“the thing” is a result of definite processes, if we could only trace\r\nthem.  “Mental attitudes,” and “predispositions,” however vague in\r\nconsciousness, have not vague causes, any more than the “blind motions of\r\nthe spring” in plants and animals.\r\n\r\nThe word “Rationalism” has the misfortune, shared by most words in this\r\ngray world, of being somewhat equivocal.  This evil may be nearly\r\novercome by careful preliminary definition; but Mr. Lecky does not supply\r\nthis, and the original specific application of the word to a particular\r\nphase of biblical interpretation seems to have clung about his use of it\r\nwith a misleading effect.  Through some parts of his book he appears to\r\nregard the grand characteristic of modern thought and civilization,\r\ncompared with ancient, as a radiation in the first instance from a change\r\nin religious conceptions.  The supremely important fact, that the gradual\r\nreduction of all phenomena within the sphere of established law, which\r\ncarries as a consequence the rejection of the miraculous, has its\r\ndetermining current in the development of physical science, seems to have\r\nengaged comparatively little of his attention; at least, he gives it no\r\nprominence.  The great conception of universal regular sequence, without\r\npartiality and without caprice—the conception which is the most potent\r\nforce at work in the modification of our faith, and of the practical form\r\ngiven to our sentiments—could only grow out of that patient watching of\r\nexternal fact, and that silencing of preconceived notions, which are\r\nurged upon the mind by the problems of physical science.\r\n\r\nThere is not room here to explain and justify the impressions of\r\ndissatisfaction which have been briefly indicated, but a serious writer\r\nlike Mr. Lecky will not find such suggestions altogether useless.  The\r\nobjections, even the misunderstandings, of a reader who is not careless\r\nor ill-disposed, may serve to stimulate an author’s vigilance over his\r\nthoughts as well as his style.  It would be gratifying to see some future\r\nproof that Mr. Lecky has acquired juster views than are implied in the\r\nassertion that philosophers of the sensational school “can never rise to\r\nthe conception of the disinterested;” and that he has freed himself from\r\nall temptation to that mingled laxity of statement and ill-pitched\r\nelevation of tone which are painfully present in the closing pages of his\r\nsecond volume.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIX.  THE GRAMMAR OF ORNAMENT. {272}\r\n\r\n\r\nThe inventor of movable types, says the venerable Teufelsdröckh, was\r\ndisbanding hired armies, cashiering most kings and senates, and creating\r\na whole new democratic world.  Has any one yet said what great things are\r\nbeing done by the men who are trying to banish ugliness from our streets\r\nand our homes, and to make both the outside and inside of our dwellings\r\nworthy of a world where there are forests and flower-tressed meadows, and\r\nthe plumage of birds; where the insects carry lessons of color on their\r\nwings, and even the surface of a stagnant pool will show us the wonders\r\nof iridescence and the most delicate forms of leafage?  They, too, are\r\nmodifying opinions, for they are modifying men’s moods and habits, which\r\nare the mothers of opinions, having quite as much to do with their\r\nformation as the responsible father—Reason.  Think of certain hideous\r\nmanufacturing towns where the piety is chiefly a belief in copious\r\nperdition, and the pleasure is chiefly gin.  The dingy surface of wall\r\npierced by the ugliest windows, the staring shop-fronts, paper-hangings,\r\ncarpets, brass and gilt mouldings, and advertising placards, have an\r\neffect akin to that of malaria; it is easy to understand that with such\r\nsurroundings there is more belief in cruelty than in beneficence, and\r\nthat the best earthly bliss attainable is the dulling of the external\r\nsenses.  For it is a fatal mistake to suppose that ugliness which is\r\ntaken for beauty will answer all the purposes of beauty; the subtle\r\nrelation between all kinds of truth and fitness in our life forbids that\r\nbad taste should ever be harmless to our moral sensibility or our\r\nintellectual discernment; and—more than that—as it is probable that fine\r\nmusical harmonies have a sanative influence over our bodily organization,\r\nit is also probable that just coloring and lovely combinations of lines\r\nmay be necessary to the complete well-being of our systems apart from any\r\nconscious delight in them.  A savage may indulge in discordant chuckles\r\nand shrieks and gutturals, and think that they please the gods, but it\r\ndoes not follow that his frame would not be favorably wrought upon by the\r\nvibrations of a grand church organ.  One sees a person capable of\r\nchoosing the worst style of wall-paper become suddenly afflicted by its\r\nugliness under an attack of illness.  And if an evil state of blood and\r\nlymph usually goes along with an evil state of mind, who shall say that\r\nthe ugliness of our streets, the falsity of our ornamentation, the\r\nvulgarity of our upholstery, have not something to do with those bad\r\ntempers which breed false conclusions?\r\n\r\nOn several grounds it is possible to make a more speedy and extensive\r\napplication of artistic reform to our interior decoration than to our\r\nexternal architecture.  One of these grounds is that most of our ugly\r\nbuildings must stand; we cannot afford to pull them down.  But every year\r\nwe are decorating interiors afresh, and people of modest means may\r\nbenefit by the introduction of beautiful designs into stucco ornaments,\r\npaper-hangings, draperies, and carpets.  Fine taste in the decoration of\r\ninteriors is a benefit that spreads from the palace to the clerk’s house\r\nwith one parlor.\r\n\r\nAll honor, then, to the architect who has zealously vindicated the claim\r\nof internal ornamentation to be a part of the architect’s function, and\r\nhas labored to rescue that form of art which is most closely connected\r\nwith the sanctities and pleasures of our hearths from the hands of\r\nuncultured tradesmen.  All the nation ought at present to know that this\r\neffort is peculiarly associated with the name of Mr. Owen Jones; and\r\nthose who are most disposed to dispute with the architect about his\r\ncoloring must at least recognize the high artistic principle which has\r\ndirected his attention to colored ornamentation as a proper branch of\r\narchitecture.  One monument of his effort in this way is his “Grammar of\r\nOrnament,” of which a new and cheaper edition has just been issued.  The\r\none point in which it differs from the original and more expensive\r\nedition, viz., the reduction in the size of the pages (the amount of\r\nmatter and number of plates are unaltered), is really an advantage; it is\r\nnow a very manageable folio, and when the reader is in a lounging mood\r\nmay be held easily on the knees.  It is a magnificent book; and those who\r\nknow no more of it than the title should be told that they will find in\r\nit a pictorial history of ornamental design, from its rudimentary\r\ncondition as seen in the productions of savage tribes, through all the\r\nother great types of art—the Egyptian, Assyrian, ancient Persian, Greek,\r\nRoman, Byzantine, Arabian, Moresque, Mohammedan-Persian, Indian, Celtic,\r\nMediæval, Renaissance, Elizabethan, and Italian.  The letter-press\r\nconsists, first, of an introductory statement of fundamental principles\r\nof ornamentation—principles, says the author, which will be found to have\r\nbeen obeyed more or less instinctively by all nations in proportion as\r\ntheir art has been a genuine product of the national genius; and,\r\nsecondly, of brief historical essays, some of them contributed by other\r\neminent artists, presenting a commentary on each characteristic series of\r\nillustrations, with the useful appendage of bibliographical lists.\r\n\r\nThe title “Grammar of Ornament” is so far appropriate that it indicates\r\nwhat Mr. Owen Jones is most anxious to be understood concerning the\r\nobject of his work, namely, that it is intended to illustrate\r\nhistorically the application of principles, and not to present a\r\ncollection of models for mere copyists.  The plates correspond to\r\nexamples in syntax, not to be repeated parrot-like, but to be studied as\r\nembodiments of syntactical principles.  There is a logic of form which\r\ncannot be departed from in ornamental design without a corresponding\r\nremoteness from perfection; unmeaning, irrelevant lines are as bad as\r\nirrelevant words or clauses, that tend no whither.  And as a suggestion\r\ntoward the origination of fresh ornamental design, the work concludes\r\nwith some beautiful drawings of leaves and flowers from nature, that the\r\nstudent, tracing in them the simple laws of form which underlie an\r\nimmense variety in beauty, may the better discern the method by which the\r\nsame laws were applied in the finest decorative work of the past, and may\r\nhave all the clearer prospect of the unexhausted possibilities of\r\nfreshness which lie before him, if, refraining from mere imitation, he\r\nwill seek only such likeness to existing forms of ornamental art as\r\narises from following like principles of combination.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nX.  ADDRESS TO WORKING MEN, BY FELIX HOLT.\r\n\r\n\r\nFellow-Workmen: I am not going to take up your time by complimenting you.\r\nIt has been the fashion to compliment kings and other authorities when\r\nthey have come into power, and to tell them that, under their wise and\r\nbeneficent rule, happiness would certainly overflow the land.  But the\r\nend has not always corresponded to that beginning.  If it were true that\r\nwe who work for wages had more of the wisdom and virtue necessary to the\r\nright use of power than has been shown by the aristocratic and mercantile\r\nclasses, we should not glory much in that fact, or consider that it\r\ncarried with it any near approach to infallibility.\r\n\r\nIn my opinion, there has been too much complimenting of that sort; and\r\nwhenever a speaker, whether he is one of ourselves or not, wastes our\r\ntime in boasting or flattery, I say, let us hiss him.  If we have the\r\nbeginning of wisdom, which is, to know a little truth about ourselves, we\r\nknow that as a body we are neither very wise nor very virtuous.  And to\r\nprove this, I will not point specially to our own habits and doings, but\r\nto the general state of the country.  Any nation that had within it a\r\nmajority of men—and we are the majority—possessed of much wisdom and\r\nvirtue, would not tolerate the bad practices, the commercial lying and\r\nswindling, the poisonous adulteration of goods, the retail cheating, and\r\nthe political bribery which are carried on boldly in the midst of us.  A\r\nmajority has the power of creating a public opinion.  We could groan and\r\nhiss before we had the franchise: if we had groaned and hissed in the\r\nright place, if we had discerned better between good and evil, if the\r\nmultitude of us artisans, and factory hands, and miners, and laborers of\r\nall sorts, had been skilful, faithful, well-judging, industrious,\r\nsober—and I don’t see how there can be wisdom and virtue anywhere without\r\nthese qualities—we should have made an audience that would have shamed\r\nthe other classes out of their share in the national vices.  We should\r\nhave had better members of Parliament, better religious teachers,\r\nhonester tradesmen, fewer foolish demagogues, less impudence in infamous\r\nand brutal men; and we should not have had among us the abomination of\r\nmen calling themselves religious while living in splendor on ill-gotten\r\ngains.  I say, it is not possible for any society in which there is a\r\nvery large body of wise and virtuous men to be as vicious as our society\r\nis—to have as low a standard of right and wrong, to have so much belief\r\nin falsehood, or to have so degrading, barbarous a notion of what\r\npleasure is, or of what justly raises a man above his fellows.\r\nTherefore, let us have none with this nonsense about our being much\r\nbetter than the rest of our countrymen, or the pretence that that was a\r\nreason why we ought to have such an extension of the franchise as has\r\nbeen given to us.  The reason for our having the franchise, as I want\r\npresently to show, lies somewhere else than in our personal good\r\nqualities, and does not in the least lie in any high betting chance that\r\na delegate is a better man than a duke, or that a Sheffield grinder is a\r\nbetter man than any one of the firm he works for.\r\n\r\nHowever, we have got our franchise now.  We have been sarcastically\r\ncalled in the House of Commons the future masters of the country; and if\r\nthat sarcasm contains any truth, it seems to me that the first thing we\r\nhad better think of is, our heavy responsibility; that is to say, the\r\nterrible risk we run of working mischief and missing good, as others have\r\ndone before us.  Suppose certain men, discontented with the irrigation of\r\na country which depended for all its prosperity on the right direction\r\nbeing given to the waters of a great river, had got the management of the\r\nirrigation before they were quite sure how exactly it could be altered\r\nfor the better, or whether they could command the necessary agency for\r\nsuch on alteration.  Those men would have a difficult and dangerous\r\nbusiness on their hands; and the more sense, feeling, and knowledge they\r\nhad, the more they would be likely to tremble rather than to triumph.\r\nOur situation is not altogether unlike theirs.  For general prosperity\r\nand well-being is a vast crop, that like the corn in Egypt can be come\r\nat, not at all by hurried snatching, but only by a well-judged patient\r\nprocess; and whether our political power will be any good to us now we\r\nhave got it, must depend entirely on the means and materials—the\r\nknowledge, ability, and honesty we have at command.  These three things\r\nare the only conditions on which we can get any lasting benefit, as every\r\nclever workman among us knows: he knows that for an article to be worth\r\nmuch there must be a good invention or plan to go upon, there must be a\r\nwell-prepared material, and there must be skilful and honest work in\r\ncarrying out the plan.  And by this test we may try those who want to be\r\nour leaders.  Have they anything to offer us besides indignant talk?\r\nWhen they tell us we ought to have this, that, or the other thing, can\r\nthey explain to us any reasonable, fair, safe way of getting it?  Can\r\nthey argue in favor of a particular change by showing us pretty closely\r\nhow the change is likely to work?  I don’t want to decry a just\r\nindignation; on the contrary, I should like it to be more thorough and\r\ngeneral.  A wise man, more than two thousand years ago, when he was asked\r\nwhat would most tend to lessen injustice in the world, said, “If every\r\nbystander felt as indignant at a wrong as if he himself were the\r\nsufferer.”  Let us cherish such indignation.  But the long-growing evils\r\nof a great nation are a tangled business, asking for a good deal more\r\nthan indignation in order to be got rid of.  Indignation is a fine\r\nwar-horse, but the war-horse must be ridden by a man: it must be ridden\r\nby rationality, skill, courage, armed with the right weapons, and taking\r\ndefinite aim.\r\n\r\nWe have reason to be discontented with many things, and, looking back\r\neither through the history of England to much earlier generations or to\r\nthe legislation and administrations of later times, we are justified in\r\nsaying that many of the evils under which our country now suffers are the\r\nconsequences of folly, ignorance, neglect, or self-seeking in those who,\r\nat different times have wielded the powers of rank, office, and money.\r\nBut the more bitterly we feel this, the more loudly we utter it, the\r\nstronger is the obligation we lay on ourselves to beware, lest we also,\r\nby a too hasty wresting of measures which seem to promise an immediate\r\npartial relief, make a worse time of it for our own generation, and leave\r\na bad inheritance to our children.  The deepest curse of wrong-doing,\r\nwhether of the foolish or wicked sort, is that its effects are difficult\r\nto be undone.  I suppose there is hardly anything more to be shuddered at\r\nthan that part of the history of disease which shows how, when a man\r\ninjures his constitution by a life of vicious excess, his children and\r\ngrandchildren inherit diseased bodies and minds, and how the effects of\r\nthat unhappy inheritance continue to spread beyond our calculation.  This\r\nis only one example of the law by which human lives are linked together;\r\nanother example of what we complain of when we point to our pauperism, to\r\nthe brutal ignorance of multitudes among our fellow countrymen, to the\r\nweight of taxation laid on us by blamable wars, to the wasteful channels\r\nmade for the public money, to the expense and trouble of getting justice,\r\nand call these the effects of bad rule.  This is the law that we all bear\r\nthe yoke of, the law of no man’s making, and which no man can undo.\r\nEverybody now sees an example of it in the case of Ireland.  We who are\r\nliving now are sufferers by the wrong-doing of those who lived before us;\r\nwe are the sufferers by each other’s wrong-doing; and the children who\r\ncome after us are and will be sufferers from the same causes.  Will any\r\nman say he doesn’t care for that law—it is nothing to him—what he wants\r\nis to better himself?  With what face then will he complain of any\r\ninjury?  If he says that in politics or in any sort of social action he\r\nwill not care to know what are likely to be the consequences to others\r\nbesides himself, he is defending the very worst doings that have brought\r\nabout his discontent.  He might as well say that there is no better rule\r\nneedful for men than that each should tug and drive for what will please\r\nhim, without caring how that tugging will act on the fine widespread\r\nnetwork of society in which he is fast meshed.  If any man taught that as\r\na doctrine, we should know him for a fool.  But there are men who act\r\nupon it; every scoundrel, for example, whether he is a rich religious\r\nscoundrel who lies and cheats on a large scale, and will perhaps come and\r\nask you to send him to Parliament, or a poor pocket-picking scoundrel,\r\nwho will steal your loose pence while you are listening round the\r\nplatform.  None of us are so ignorant as not to know that a society, a\r\nnation is held together by just the opposite doctrine and action—by the\r\ndependence of men on each other and the sense they have of a common\r\ninterest in preventing injury.  And we working men are, I think, of all\r\nclasses the last that can afford to forget this; for if we did we should\r\nbe much like sailors cutting away the timbers of our own ship to warm our\r\ngrog with.  For what else is the meaning of our trades-unions?  What else\r\nis the meaning of every flag we carry, every procession we make, every\r\ncrowd we collect for the sake of making some protest on behalf of our\r\nbody as receivers of wages, if not this: that it is our interest to stand\r\nby each other, and that this being the common interest, no one of us will\r\ntry to make a good bargain for himself without considering what will be\r\ngood for his fellows?  And every member of a union believes that the\r\nwider he can spread his union, the stronger and surer will be the effect\r\nof it.  So I think I shall be borne out in saying that a working man who\r\ncan put two and two together, or take three from four and see what will\r\nbe the remainder, can understand that a society, to be well off, must be\r\nmade up chiefly of men who consider the general good as well as their\r\nown.\r\n\r\nWell, but taking the world as it is—and this is one way we must take it\r\nwhen we want to find out how it can be improved—no society is made up of\r\na single class: society stands before us like that wonderful piece of\r\nlife, the human body, with all its various parts depending on one\r\nanother, and with a terrible liability to get wrong because of that\r\ndelicate dependence.  We all know how many diseases the human body is apt\r\nto suffer from, and how difficult it is even for the doctors to find out\r\nexactly where the seat or beginning of the disorder is.  That is because\r\nthe body is made up of so many various parts, all related to each other,\r\nor likely all to feel the effect if any one of them goes wrong.  It is\r\nsomewhat the same with our old nations or societies.  No society ever\r\nstood long in the world without getting to be composed of different\r\nclasses.  Now, it is all pretence to say that there is no such thing as\r\nclass interest.  It is clear that if any particular number of men get a\r\nparticular benefit from any existing institution, they are likely to band\r\ntogether, in order to keep up that benefit and increase it, until it is\r\nperceived to be unfair and injurious to another large number, who get\r\nknowledge and strength enough to set up a resistance.  And this, again,\r\nhas been part of the history of every great society since history began.\r\nBut the simple reason for this being, that any large body of men is\r\nlikely to have more of stupidity, narrowness, and greed than of\r\nfarsightedness and generosity, it is plain that the number who resist\r\nunfairness and injury are in danger of becoming injurious in their turn.\r\nAnd in this way a justifiable resistance has become a damaging\r\nconvulsion, making everything worse instead of better.  This has been\r\nseen so often that we ought to profit a little by the experience.  So\r\nlong as there is selfishness in men; so long as they have not found out\r\nfor themselves institutions which express and carry into practice the\r\ntruth, that the highest interest of mankind must at last be a common and\r\nnot a divided interest; so long as the gradual operation of steady causes\r\nhas not made that truth a part of every man’s knowledge and feeling, just\r\nas we now not only know that it is good for our health to be cleanly, but\r\nfeel that cleanliness is only another word for comfort, which is the\r\nunder-side or lining of all pleasure; so long, I say as men wink at their\r\nown knowingness, or hold their heads high because they have got an\r\nadvantage over their fellows; so long class interest will be in danger of\r\nmaking itself felt injuriously.  No set of men will get any sort of power\r\nwithout being in danger of wanting more than their right share.  But, on\r\nthe other hand, it is just as certain that no set of men will get angry\r\nat having less than their right share, and set up a claim on that ground,\r\nwithout falling into just the same danger of exacting too much, and\r\nexacting it in wrong ways.  It’s human nature we have got to work with\r\nall round, and nothing else.  That seems like saying something very\r\ncommonplace—nay, obvious; as if one should say that where there are hands\r\nthere are mouths.  Yet, to hear a good deal of the speechifying and to\r\nsee a good deal of the action that go forward, one might suppose it was\r\nforgotten.\r\n\r\nBut I come back to this: that, in our old society, there are old\r\ninstitutions, and among them the various distinctions and inherited\r\nadvantages of classes, which have shaped themselves along with all the\r\nwonderful slow-growing system of things made up of our laws, our\r\ncommerce, and our stores of all sorts, whether in material objects, such\r\nas buildings and machinery, or in knowledge, such as scientific thought\r\nand professional skill.  Just as in that case I spoke of before, the\r\nirrigation of a country, which must absolutely have its water distributed\r\nor it will bear no crop; there are the old channels, the old banks, and\r\nthe old pumps, which must be used as they are until new and better have\r\nbeen prepared, or the structure of the old has been gradually altered.\r\nBut it would be fool’s work to batter down a pump only because a better\r\nmight be made, when you had no machinery ready for a new one: it would be\r\nwicked work, if villages lost their crops by it.  Now the only safe way\r\nby which society can be steadily improved and our worst evils reduced, is\r\nnot by any attempt to do away directly with the actually existing class\r\ndistinctions and advantages, as if everybody could have the same sort of\r\nwork, or lead the same sort of life (which none of my hearers are stupid\r\nenough to suppose), but by the turning of class interests into class\r\nfunctions or duties.  What I mean is, that each class should be urged by\r\nthe surrounding conditions to perform its particular work under the\r\nstrong pressure of responsibility to the nation at large; that our public\r\naffairs should be got into a state in which there should be no impunity\r\nfor foolish or faithless conduct.  In this way the public judgment would\r\nsift out incapability and dishonesty from posts of high charge, and even\r\npersonal ambition would necessarily become of a worthier sort, since the\r\ndesires of the most selfish men must be a good deal shaped by the\r\nopinions of those around them; and for one person to put on a cap and\r\nbells, or to go about dishonest or paltry ways of getting rich that he\r\nmay spend a vast sum of money in having more finery than his neighbors,\r\nhe must be pretty sure of a crowd who will applaud him.  Now, changes can\r\nonly be good in proportion as they help to bring about this sort of\r\nresult: in proportion as they put knowledge in the place of ignorance,\r\nand fellow-feeling in the place of selfishness.  In the course of that\r\nsubstitution class distinctions must inevitably change their character,\r\nand represent the varying duties of men, not their varying interests.\r\nBut this end will not come by impatience.  “Day will not break the sooner\r\nbecause we get up before the twilight.”  Still less will it come by mere\r\nundoing, or change merely as change.  And moreover, if we believed that\r\nit would be unconditionally hastened by our getting the franchise, we\r\nshould be what I call superstitious men, believing in magic, or the\r\nproduction of a result by hocus-pocus.  Our getting the franchise will\r\ngreatly hasten that good end in proportion only as every one of us has\r\nthe knowledge, the foresight, the conscience, that will make him\r\nwell-judging and scrupulous in the use of it.  The nature of things in\r\nthis world has been determined for us beforehand, and in such a way that\r\nno ship can be expected to sail well on a difficult voyage, and reach the\r\nright port, unless it is well manned: the nature of the winds and the\r\nwaves, of the timbers, the sails, and the cordage, will not accommodate\r\nitself to drunken, mutinous sailors.\r\n\r\nYou will not suspect me of wanting to preach any cant to you, or of\r\njoining in the pretence that everything is in a fine way, and need not be\r\nmade better.  What I am striving to keep in our minds is the care, the\r\nprecaution, with which we should go about making things better, so that\r\nthe public order may not be destroyed, so that no fatal shock may be\r\ngiven to this society of ours, this living body in which our lives are\r\nbound up.  After the Reform Bill of 1832 I was in an election riot, which\r\nshowed me clearly, on a small scale, what public disorder must always be;\r\nand I have never forgotten that the riot was brought about chiefly by the\r\nagency of dishonest men who professed to be on the people’s side.  Now,\r\nthe danger hanging over change is great, just in proportion as it tends\r\nto produce such disorder by giving any large number of ignorant men,\r\nwhose notions of what is good are of a low and brutal sort, the belief\r\nthat they have got power into their hands, and may do pretty much as they\r\nlike.  If any one can look round us and say that he sees no signs of any\r\nsuch danger now, and that our national condition is running along like a\r\nclear broadening stream, safe not to get choked with mud, I call him a\r\ncheerful man: perhaps he does his own gardening, and seldom taken\r\nexercise far away from home.  To us who have no gardens, and often walk\r\nabroad, it is plain that we can never get into a bit of a crowd but we\r\nmust rub clothes with a set of roughs, who have the worst vices of the\r\nworst rich—who are gamblers, sots, libertines, knaves, or else mere\r\nsensual simpletons and victims.  They are the ugly crop that has sprung\r\nup while the stewards have been sleeping; they are the multiplying brood\r\nbegotten by parents who have been left without all teaching save that of\r\na too craving body, without all well-being save the fading delusions of\r\ndrugged beer and gin.  They are the hideous margin of society, at one\r\nedge drawing toward it the undesigning ignorant poor, at the other\r\ndarkening imperceptibly into the lowest criminal class.  Here is one of\r\nthe evils which cannot be got rid of quickly, and against which any of us\r\nwho have got sense, decency, and instruction have need to watch.  That\r\nthese degraded fellow-men could really get the mastery in a persistent\r\ndisobedience to the laws and in a struggle to subvert order, I do not\r\nbelieve; but wretched calamities must come from the very beginning of\r\nsuch a struggle, and the continuance of it would be a civil war, in which\r\nthe inspiration on both sides might soon cease to be even a false notion\r\nof good, and might become the direct savage impulse of ferocity.  We have\r\nall to see to it that we do not help to rouse what I may call the savage\r\nbeast in the breasts of our generation—that we do not help to poison the\r\nnation’s blood, and make richer provision for bestiality to come.  We\r\nknow well enough that oppressors have sinned in this way—that oppression\r\nhas notoriously made men mad; and we are determined to resist oppression.\r\nBut let us, if possible, show that we can keep sane in our resistance,\r\nand shape our means more and more reasonably toward the least harmful,\r\nand therefore the speediest, attainment of our end.  Let us, I say, show\r\nthat our spirits are too strong to be driven mad, but can keep that sober\r\ndetermination which alone gives mastery over the adaptation of means.\r\nAnd a first guarantee of this sanity will be to act as if we understood\r\nthat the fundamental duty of a government is to preserve order, to\r\nenforce obedience of the laws.  It has been held hitherto that a man can\r\nbe depended on as a guardian of order only when he has much money and\r\ncomfort to lose.  But a better state of things would be, that men who had\r\nlittle money and not much comfort should still be guardians of order,\r\nbecause they had sense to see that disorder would do no good, and had a\r\nheart of justice, pity, and fortitude, to keep them from making more\r\nmisery only because they felt some misery themselves.  There are\r\nthousands of artisans who have already shown this fine spirit, and have\r\nendured much with patient heroism.  If such a spirit spread, and\r\npenetrated us all, we should soon become the masters of the country in\r\nthe best sense and to the best ends.  For, the public order being\r\npreserved, there can be no government in future that will not be\r\ndetermined by our insistance on our fair and practicable demands.  It is\r\nonly by disorder that our demands will be choked, that we shall find\r\nourselves lost among a brutal rabble, with all the intelligence of the\r\ncountry opposed to us, and see government in the shape of guns that will\r\nsweep us down in the ignoble martyrdom of fools.\r\n\r\nIt has been a too common notion that to insist much on the preservation\r\nof order is the part of a selfish aristocracy and a selfish commercial\r\nclass, because among these, in the nature of things, have been found the\r\nopponents of change.  I am a Radical; and, what is more, I am not a\r\nRadical with a title, or a French cook, or even an entrance into fine\r\nsociety.  I expect great changes, and I desire them.  But I don’t expect\r\nthem to come in a hurry, by mere inconsiderate sweeping.  A Hercules with\r\na big besom is a fine thing for a filthy stable, but not for weeding a\r\nseed-bed, where his besom would soon make a barren floor.\r\n\r\nThat is old-fashioned talk, some one may say.  We know all that.\r\n\r\nYes, when things are put in an extreme way, most people think they know\r\nthem; but, after all, they are comparatively few who see the small\r\ndegrees by which those extremes are arrived at, or have the resolution\r\nand self-control to resist the little impulses by which they creep on\r\nsurely toward a fatal end.  Does anybody set out meaning to ruin himself,\r\nor to drink himself to death, or to waste his life so that he becomes a\r\ndespicable old man, a superannuated nuisance, like a fly in winter.  Yet\r\nthere are plenty, of whose lot this is the pitiable story.  Well now,\r\nsupposing us all to have the best intentions, we working men, as a body,\r\nrun some risk of bringing evil on the nation in that unconscious\r\nmanner—half hurrying, half pushed in a jostling march toward an end we\r\nare not thinking of.  For just as there are many things which we know\r\nbetter and feel much more strongly than the richer, softer-handed classes\r\ncan know or feel them; so there are many things—many precious\r\nbenefits—which we, by the very fact of our privations, our lack of\r\nleisure and instruction, are not so likely to be aware of and take into\r\nour account.  Those precious benefits form a chief part of what I may\r\ncall the common estate of society: a wealth over and above buildings,\r\nmachinery, produce, shipping, and so on, though closely connected with\r\nthese; a wealth of a more delicate kind, that we may more unconsciously\r\nbring into danger, doing harm and not knowing that we do it.  I mean that\r\ntreasure of knowledge, science, poetry, refinement of thought, feeling,\r\nand manners, great memories and the interpretation of great records,\r\nwhich is carried on from the minds of one generation to the minds of\r\nanother.  This is something distinct from the indulgences of luxury and\r\nthe pursuit of vain finery; and one of the hardships in the lot of\r\nworking men is that they have been for the most part shut out from\r\nsharing in this treasure.  It can make a man’s life very great, very full\r\nof delight, though he has no smart furniture and no horses: it also\r\nyields a great deal of discovery that corrects error, and of invention\r\nthat lessens bodily pain, and must at least make life easier for all.\r\n\r\nNow the security of this treasure demands, not only the preservation of\r\norder, but a certain patience on our part with many institutions and\r\nfacts of various kinds, especially touching the accumulation of wealth,\r\nwhich from the light we stand in, we are more likely to discern the evil\r\nthan the good of.  It is constantly the task of practical wisdom not to\r\nsay, “This is good, and I will have it,” but to say, “This is the less of\r\ntwo unavoidable evils, and I will bear it.”  And this treasure of\r\nknowledge, which consists in the fine activity, the exalted vision of\r\nmany minds, is bound up at present with conditions which have much evil\r\nin them.  Just as in the case of material wealth and its distribution we\r\nare obliged to take the selfishness and weaknesses of human nature into\r\naccount, and however we insist that men might act better, are forced,\r\nunless we are fanatical simpletons, to consider how they are likely to\r\nact; so in this matter of the wealth that is carried in men’s minds, we\r\nhave to reflect that the too absolute predominance of a class whose wants\r\nhave been of a common sort, who are chiefly struggling to get better and\r\nmore food, clothing, shelter, and bodily recreation, may lead to hasty\r\nmeasures for the sake of having things more fairly shared, which, even if\r\nthey did not fail of their object, would at last debase the life of the\r\nnation.  Do anything which will throw the classes who hold the treasures\r\nof knowledge—nay, I may say, the treasure of refined needs—into the\r\nbackground, cause them to withdraw from public affairs, stop too suddenly\r\nany of the sources by which their leisure and ease are furnished, rob\r\nthem of the chances by which they may be influential and pre-eminent, and\r\nyou do something as short-sighted as the acts of France and Spain when in\r\njealousy and wrath, not altogether unprovoked, they drove from among them\r\nraces and classes that held the traditions of handicraft and agriculture.\r\nYou injure your own inheritance and the inheritance of your children.\r\nYou may truly say that this which I call the common estate of society has\r\nbeen anything but common to you; but the same may be said, by many of us,\r\nof the sunlight and the air, of the sky and the fields, of parks and\r\nholiday games.  Nevertheless that these blessings exist makes life\r\nworthier to us, and urges us the more to energetic, likely means of\r\ngetting our share in them; and I say, let us watch carefully, lest we do\r\nanything to lessen this treasure which is held in the minds of men, while\r\nwe exert ourselves, first of all, and to the very utmost, that we and our\r\nchildren may share in all its benefits.  Yes; exert ourselves to the\r\nutmost, to break the yoke of ignorance.  If we demand more leisure, more\r\nease in our lives, let us show that we don’t deserve the reproach of\r\nwanting to shirk that industry which, in some form or other, every man,\r\nwhether rich or poor, should feel himself as much bound to as he is bound\r\nto decency.  Let us show that we want to have some time and strength left\r\nto us, that we may use it, not for brutal indulgence, but for the\r\nrational exercise of the faculties which make us men.  Without this no\r\npolitical measures can benefit us.  No political institution will alter\r\nthe nature of Ignorance, or hinder it from producing vice and misery.\r\nLet Ignorance start how it will, it must run the same round of low\r\nappetites, poverty, slavery, and superstition.  Some of us know this\r\nwell—nay, I will say, feel it; for knowledge of this kind cuts deep; and\r\nto us it is one of the most painful facts belonging to our condition that\r\nthere are numbers of our fellow-workmen who are so far from feeling in\r\nthe same way, that they never use the imperfect opportunities already\r\noffered them for giving their children some schooling, but turn their\r\nlittle ones of tender age into bread-winners, often at cruel tasks,\r\nexposed to the horrible infection of childish vice.  Of course, the\r\ncauses of these hideous things go a long way back.  Parents’ misery has\r\nmade parents’ wickedness.  But we, who are still blessed with the hearts\r\nof fathers and the consciences of men—we who have some knowledge of the\r\ncurse entailed on broods of creatures in human shape, whose enfeebled\r\nbodies and dull perverted minds are mere centres of uneasiness in whom\r\neven appetite is feeble and joy impossible—I say we are bound to use all\r\nthe means at our command to help in putting a stop to this horror.  Here,\r\nit seems to me, is a way in which we may use extended co-operation among\r\nus to the most momentous of all purposes, and make conditions of\r\nenrolment that would strengthen all educational measures.  It is true\r\nenough that there is a low sense of parental duties in the nation at\r\nlarge, and that numbers who have no excuse in bodily hardship seem to\r\nthink it a light thing to beget children, to bring human beings with all\r\ntheir tremendous possibilities into this difficult world, and then take\r\nlittle heed how they are disciplined and furnished for the perilous\r\njourney they are sent on without any asking of their own.  This is a sin\r\nshared in more or less by all classes; but there are sins which, like\r\ntaxation, fall the heaviest on the poorest, and none have such galling\r\nreasons as we working men to try and rouse to the utmost the feeling of\r\nresponsibility in fathers and mothers.  We have been urged into\r\nco-operation by the pressure of common demands.  In war men need each\r\nother more; and where a given point has to be defended, fighters\r\ninevitably find themselves shoulder to shoulder.  So fellowship grows, so\r\ngrow the rules of fellowship, which gradually shape themselves to\r\nthoroughness as the idea of a common good becomes more complete.  We feel\r\na right to say, If you will be one of us, you must make such and such a\r\ncontribution—you must renounce such and such a separate advantage—you\r\nmust set your face against such and such an infringement.  If we have any\r\nfalse ideas about our common good, our rules will be wrong, and we shall\r\nbe co-operating to damage each other.  But, now, here is a part of our\r\ngood, without which everything else we strive for will be worthless—I\r\nmean the rescue of our children.  Let us demand from the members of our\r\nunions that they fulfil their duty as parents in this definite matter,\r\nwhich rules can reach.  Let us demand that they send their children to\r\nschool, so as not to go on recklessly, breeding a moral pestilence among\r\nus, just as strictly as we demand that they pay their contributions to a\r\ncommon fund, understood to be for a common benefit.  While we watch our\r\npublic men, let us watch one another as to this duty, which is also\r\npublic, and more momentous even than obedience to sanitary regulations.\r\nWhile we resolutely declare against the wickedness in high places, let us\r\nset ourselves also against the wickedness in low places, not quarrelling\r\nwhich came first, or which is the worse of the two—not trying to settle\r\nthe miserable precedence of plague or famine, but insisting unflinchingly\r\non remedies once ascertained, and summoning those who hold the treasure\r\nof knowledge to remember that they hold it in trust, and that with them\r\nlies the task of searching for new remedies, and finding the right\r\nmethods of applying them.\r\n\r\nTo find right remedies and right methods.  Here is the great function of\r\nknowledge: here the life of one man may make a fresh era straight away,\r\nin which a sort of suffering that has existed shall exist no more.  For\r\nthe thousands of years down to the middle of the sixteenth century that\r\nhuman limbs had been hacked and amputated, nobody knew how to stop the\r\nbleeding except by searing the ends of the vessels with red-hot iron.\r\nBut then came a man named Ambrose Paré, and said, “Tie up the arteries!”\r\nThat was a fine word to utter.  It contained the statement of a method—a\r\nplan by which a particular evil was forever assuaged.  Let us try to\r\ndiscern the men whose words carry that sort of kernel, and choose such\r\nmen to be our guides and representatives—not choose platform swaggerers,\r\nwho bring us nothing but the ocean to make our broth with.\r\n\r\nTo get the chief power into the hands of the wisest, which means to get\r\nour life regulated according to the truest principles mankind is in\r\npossession of, is a problem as old as the very notion of wisdom.  The\r\nsolution comes slowly, because men collectively can only be made to\r\nembrace principles, and to act on them, by the slow stupendous teaching\r\nof the world’s events.  Men will go on planting potatoes, and nothing\r\nelse but potatoes, till a potato disease comes and forces them to find\r\nout the advantage of a varied crop.  Selfishness, stupidity, sloth,\r\npersist in trying to adapt the world to their desires, till a time comes\r\nwhen the world manifests itself as too decidedly inconvenient to them.\r\nWisdom stands outside of man and urges itself upon him, like the marks of\r\nthe changing seasons, before it finds a home within him, directs his\r\nactions, and from the precious effects of obedience begets a\r\ncorresponding love.\r\n\r\nBut while still outside of us, wisdom often looks terrible, and wears\r\nstrange forms, wrapped in the changing conditions of a struggling world.\r\nIt wears now the form of wants and just demands in a great multitude of\r\nBritish men: wants and demands urged into existence by the forces of a\r\nmaturing world.  And it is in virtue of this—in virtue of this presence\r\nof wisdom on our side as a mighty fact, physical and moral, which must\r\nenter into and shape the thoughts and actions of mankind—that we working\r\nmen have obtained the suffrage.  Not because we are an excellent\r\nmultitude, but because we are a needy multitude.\r\n\r\nBut now, for our own part, we have seriously to consider this outside\r\nwisdom which lies in the supreme unalterable nature of things, and watch\r\nto give it a home within us and obey it.  If the claims of the unendowed\r\nmultitude of working men hold within them principles which must shape the\r\nfuture, it is not less true that the endowed classes, in their\r\ninheritance from the past, hold the precious material without which no\r\nworthy, noble future can be moulded.  Many of the highest uses of life\r\nare in their keeping; and if privilege has often been abused, it has also\r\nbeen the nurse of excellence.  Here again we have to submit ourselves to\r\nthe great law of inheritance.  If we quarrel with the way in which the\r\nlabors and earnings of the past have been preserved and handed down, we\r\nare just as bigoted, just as narrow, just as wanting in that religion\r\nwhich keeps an open ear and an obedient mind to the teachings of fact, as\r\nwe accuse those of being, who quarrel with the new truths and new needs\r\nwhich are disclosed in the present.  The deeper insight we get into the\r\ncauses of human trouble, and the ways by which men are made better and\r\nhappier, the less we shall be inclined to the unprofitable spirit and\r\npractice of reproaching classes as such in a wholesale fashion.  Not all\r\nthe evils of our condition are such as we can justly blame others for;\r\nand, I repeat, many of them are such as no changes of institutions can\r\nquickly remedy.  To discern between the evils that energy can remove and\r\nthe evils that patience must bear, makes the difference between manliness\r\nand childishness, between good sense and folly.  And more than that,\r\nwithout such discernment, seeing that we have grave duties toward our own\r\nbody and the country at large, we can hardly escape acts of fatal\r\nrashness and injustice.\r\n\r\nI am addressing a mixed assembly of workmen, and some of you may be as\r\nwell or better fitted than I am to take up this office.  But they will\r\nnot think it amiss in me that I have tried to bring together the\r\nconsiderations most likely to be of service to us in preparing ourselves\r\nfor the use of our new opportunities.  I have avoided touching on special\r\nquestions.  The best help toward judging well on these is to approach\r\nthem in the right temper without vain expectation, and with a resolution\r\nwhich is mixed with temperance.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFootnotes:\r\n\r\n\r\n{31}  1.  “Madame de Sablé.
