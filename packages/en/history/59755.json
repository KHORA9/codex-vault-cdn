A.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nINTRODUCTORY NOTE BY THE EDITOR\r\n\r\n\r\nWilliam Hickling Prescott was born in Salem, Massachusetts, May 4, 1796.\r\nHe died in Boston, January 28, 1859. William Prescott, his father, a\r\nlawyer of great ability and of sterling worth, was at one time a judge,\r\nand was frequently elected to public positions of trust and\r\nresponsibility. His mother was a daughter of Thomas Hickling, for many\r\nyears United States Consul at the Azores. His grandfather, William\r\nPrescott, was in command of the American forces at the battle of Bunker\r\nHill, June 17, 1775. On both sides, therefore, the future historian was\r\ndescended from what Oliver Wendell Holmes aptly termed the “New England\r\nBrahman Stock.” He was prepared for college by an unusually accomplished\r\nscholar, John Sylvester John Gardiner, for many years the rector of\r\nTrinity Church, Boston, and entered Harvard College as a sophomore in\r\n1811. Three years later he graduated with the Class of 1814.\r\n\r\nDuring his junior year came the accident which was to change the whole\r\ncourse of his life. As he was leaving the dining-hall, in which the\r\nstudents sat at “Commons,” a biscuit, thrown by a careless\r\nfellow-student, struck him squarely in the left eye and stretched him\r\nsenseless upon the floor. Paralysis of the retina was the result; the\r\ninjury was beyond the reach of the healing art, and the sight of one eye\r\nwas utterly destroyed. After a period of intense suffering, spent in a\r\ndarkened room, he recovered sufficiently to resume his college work and\r\nto be graduated with his class. For a year and a half the uninjured eye\r\nserved him fairly well. Then, suddenly, acute rheumatism attacked it,\r\ncausing, except in occasional periods of intermission, excruciating pain\r\nduring the rest of his life. Total darkness, for weeks at a time, was\r\nnot infrequently Prescott’s lot, and work, except under a most careful\r\nadjustment of every ray of light, was almost out of the question. Under\r\nthese circumstances the career at the bar which his father had planned\r\nfor him, and to which he had looked forward with so much pleasure was no\r\nlonger to be thought of. Business offered no attractions, even if a\r\nbusiness life had been possible to him in his semi-blindness. He turned\r\nhis attention to literature, and found there his vocation.\r\n\r\nBut for this work he felt that the most careful preparation was\r\nnecessary. In a letter, written eighteen months before his death, he\r\nsays, “I proposed to devote ten years of my life to the study of ancient\r\nand modern literature, chiefly the latter, and to give ten years more to\r\nsome historical work. I have had the good fortune to accomplish this\r\ndesign pretty nearly within the limits assigned. In the Christmas of\r\n1837 my first work was given to the public.”\r\n\r\nDuring the first ten years of preparation he was a frequent contributor\r\nto the Reviews, writing some of the papers which are printed in the\r\nvolume of “Miscellanies” which has always formed part of his “works.”\r\nHis historical work was accomplished with the utmost difficulty.\r\nAmerican scholarship was not then advanced, and it was almost impossible\r\nto secure readers who possessed a knowledge of foreign languages.\r\nPathetically Mr. Prescott tells of the difficulties surmounted. The\r\nsecretary he employed at first knew no language but his own. “I taught\r\nhim to pronounce the Castilian in a manner suited, I suspect, much more\r\nto my ear than to that of a Spaniard; and we began our wearisome journey\r\nthrough Mariana’s noble history. I cannot even now recall to mind\r\nwithout a smile the tedious hours in which, seated under some old trees\r\nin my country residence, we pursued our slow and melancholy way over\r\npages which afforded no glimmering of light to him, and from which the\r\nlight came dimly struggling to me through a half intelligible\r\nvocabulary. But in a few weeks the light became stronger, and I was\r\ncheered by the consciousness of my own improvement; and when we had\r\ntoiled our way through seven quartos I found I could understand the book\r\nwhen read about two-thirds as fast as ordinary English.” Having thus\r\ngathered the ideas of his many authorities from the mechanical lips of\r\nhis secretary, Mr. Prescott would ponder them for a time, and would then\r\ndictate the notes for a chapter of from forty to fifty pages. These\r\nnotes were read and reread to him while the subject was still fresh in\r\nhis memory. He ran them over many times in his mind before he began to\r\ndictate the final copy, and was thus able to escape errors into which\r\nmen with full command of their sight frequently fall. For the last\r\nthirty years of his life he made use of a writing instrument for the\r\nblind, the noctograph, by which he was able to write his own pages and\r\npartially to dispense with dictation. With the noctograph he wrote with\r\ngreat rapidity, but in an almost illegible hand which only the author\r\nand his secretary could read.\r\n\r\nWhen, after twenty years of labor, the “History of the Reign of\r\nFerdinand and Isabella” was finished, its author was so doubtful\r\nrespecting its value that he proposed simply to put it upon his library\r\nshelf “for the benefit of those who should come after.” His father\r\nwisely combated this morbid judgment and insisted upon its publication.\r\n“The man who writes a book which he is afraid to publish is a coward,”\r\nhe said to his son. The work was given to the world in 1837 and was\r\nimmediately and immensely successful. Its author, who had hitherto been\r\nonly an obscure writer of reviews, took his place at once in the first\r\nrank of contemporary historians,--to use the words of Daniel\r\nWebster,--“like a comet that had blazed out upon the world in full\r\nsplendor.” In a very short space of time translations appeared in\r\nSpanish, German, French, and Italian. Critics of many nationalities\r\njoined in concurrent praise.\r\n\r\nIn a way Mr. Prescott’s achievement was a national triumph. British\r\nreviewers were even more laudatory than were the American. One of the\r\nmost striking testimonials came from Richard Ford, the author of the\r\nfamous “Handbook for Spain,”--an English scholar whose knowledge of\r\nthings Spanish was phenomenal. Mr. Ford wrote, “Mr. Prescott’s is by far\r\nthe first historical work which British America has yet produced, and\r\none that need hardly fear a comparison with any that has issued from the\r\nEuropean press since this century began.” Mr. Ford was not enthusiastic\r\nover American institutions and was by no means prepared to believe that\r\nthe American experiment in democratic government was likely to result in\r\na permanent State. It was with an eye to posterity, therefore, that he\r\ncautiously and vaguely assigned Mr. Prescott not to the United States,\r\nbut to British America. The commendatory notices that appeared in\r\nBritish publications showed that many men besides Mr. Ford were\r\nastounded that “British America” could produce such an excellent\r\nspecimen of historical workmanship. Sydney Smith’s praise was most\r\nenthusiastic. He even went so far as to promise the American author a\r\n“Caspian Sea of Soup” if he would visit England.\r\n\r\nThe new historian was not spoiled by the adulation showered upon him.\r\nRejoicing in the unexpected praise, he devoted himself with renewed\r\nzeal, and with even greater care, to the composition of another work.\r\nThis, “The History of the Conquest of Mexico,” appeared in 1843, and in\r\nless than twelve months seven thousand copies of it had been sold in the\r\nUnited States. The art of advertising, in which the publishers of\r\nto-day are so proficient, had not then been developed; the “Conquest of\r\nMexico” made its own way among the reading public. For the English\r\ncopyright Bentley, the London publisher, paid £650. Ten editions were\r\npublished in England in sixteen years, and twenty-three were issued in\r\nthe United States. Popular approval was even more pronounced than in the\r\ncase of the “Ferdinand and Isabella,” and the applause of the reviewers\r\nwas also much more loud. The pure and sound English appealed especially\r\nto scholars like Milman. That famous historian placed Prescott “in the\r\nmidst of the small community of really good English writers of history\r\nin modern times.” Coming from the editor of the best edition of Gibbon’s\r\n“Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire,” this was praise indeed. The\r\n_Edinburgh Review_ said, “Every reader of intelligence forgets the\r\nbeauty of his coloring in the grandeur of his outline.... Nothing but a\r\nconnected sketch of the latter can do justice to the highest charm of\r\nthe work.” Stirling, author of the “Cloister Life of the Emperor Charles\r\nthe Fifth,” wrote, “The account of the Triste Noche, the woeful night in\r\nwhich, after the death of Montezuma, Cortés and his band retreated\r\nacross the lake and over the broken causeway, cutting their way through\r\na nation in arms, is one of the finest pictures of modern historical\r\npainting.” The Spanish Royal Academy of History had elected Prescott to\r\nmembership in that august body soon after his “History of the Reign of\r\nFerdinand and Isabella” appeared; other historical societies and\r\nlearned bodies now heaped honors upon him.\r\n\r\nThe historian kept steadily at work. The task to which he had devoted\r\nhimself was to tell the tale of Spanish greatness when the fortunes of\r\nSpain were at their highest point. The “History of the Conquest of Peru”\r\nwas published in 1847, four years after the appearance of the “Mexico.”\r\nIt reads like a romance and has always been the most popular of\r\nPrescott’s works. To-day it is the only history of the early Spanish\r\nachievements in Peru which is regarded as an “authority” on the South\r\nAmerican republic, and is always kept in stock in Peruvian bookstores.\r\nFor the English copyright of this work Bentley paid £800. Seventeen\r\nthousand copies were sold in thirteen years. The demand for it is\r\nconstant.\r\n\r\nThe author’s fame was now fully established. He was everywhere regarded\r\nas one of the greatest of living historians, and honors and wealth\r\nflowed steadily towards him. His income from his books was very large.\r\nStirling estimates it at from £4000 to £5000 per annum. This, in\r\naddition to the fortune he had inherited, made Mr. Prescott a very\r\nwealthy man in the years when the enormous incomes of to-day were hardly\r\ndreamed of. He was as methodical and careful in pecuniary affairs as in\r\nhis literary work. A most accurate account was kept of his receipts and\r\nexpenditures, and one-tenth of his income was always devoted to charity.\r\n\r\nIn 1850 he made a short visit to Europe, spending some time upon the\r\nContinent but more in England and Scotland. Everywhere he was lionized\r\nin a way that would have turned the heads of most men. The University of\r\nOxford made him a D.C.L. The doors of the houses where learning was\r\nhonored opened at his approach. His own charming personality was,\r\nhowever, one of the greatest factors in his social success. As a man he\r\nwas most lovable.\r\n\r\nUpon his return to America he devoted himself to writing the “History of\r\nthe Reign of Philip the Second,” for which task he had accumulated an\r\nextensive collection of documentary “authorities.” This work was to\r\nappear in six volumes, and for it the author was offered £1000 a volume\r\nby two publishers. Two volumes were published in 1855 and a third\r\nappeared three years later. Macaulay pronounced “Philip the Second” Mr.\r\nPrescott’s best work. Its style is more finished, its use of authorities\r\nmore masterly than in the previous volumes. For dramatic interest the\r\nchapters describing the defence of Malta by the Knights of the Hospital\r\nof St. John of Jerusalem are quite equal to the account of the “Triste\r\nNoche,” of Cortés and his companions in Mexico, which so excited the\r\nadmiration of Stirling. But the work was never to be completed. After\r\ntwo volumes had appeared, there was published “Prescott’s Edition of\r\nRobertson’s Charles the Fifth.” This was simply a new edition of the\r\nScottish historian’s work, with additions dealing with the later years\r\nof the Emperor’s life which Robertson had not treated. In it is given\r\nthe true story of the emperor’s retirement and death. Mr. Prescott had\r\nfor Robertson a very great admiration. He always acknowledged his deep\r\nobligation to him, and he felt that it would be most unnecessary, and in\r\nfact almost presumptuous, for him to attempt to re-write a history which\r\nthe Scottsman had written so well. In these three works, “Ferdinand and\r\nIsabella,” “Charles the Fifth,” and “Philip the Second,” a century and a\r\nhalf of the most important part of Spanish history is presented. That\r\nPrescott did not live to complete the third must always be regarded as a\r\ngreat calamity by the literary world.\r\n\r\nBesides the volumes already specified, another, of “Miscellaneous\r\nEssays” (a selection from his earlier contributions to reviews and other\r\nperiodicals) has always been included in Prescott’s published works. To\r\nthe historical student this volume is even more interesting than to the\r\ngeneral reader. It illustrates the change, which, since its publication,\r\nhas taken place in the methods of the reviewer and of the writer of\r\nhistory as well.\r\n\r\nOn February 4, 1858, Mr. Prescott was stricken with paralysis. The shock\r\nwas a slight one. He soon recovered from its effects and continued with\r\nundaunted perseverance his literary work. In less than a year, January\r\n28, 1859, while at work in his library with his secretary, he fell back\r\nspeechless from a second attack and died an hour or so afterwards.\r\n\r\nIt is quite within bounds to say that no historian’s death ever affected\r\nmore profoundly the community in which he dwelt. Other authors have been\r\nrespected and admired by those with whom they came in contact, Prescott\r\nwas universally loved. No American writer was perhaps more sincerely and\r\nmore widely mourned. Affable, generous, courtly, thoughtful for others,\r\nsingularly winning in his personal appearance, he had drawn the hearts\r\nof all his associates to himself, while the gracious, kindly humanity\r\nmanifested in every page of his writings had endeared him to thousands\r\nof readers in all parts of the world.\r\n\r\nMr. Prescott’s distinguishing characteristic was his intense love for\r\ntruth. As an author he had no thesis to establish. He never wasted time\r\nin arguments wherewith to demonstrate the soundness of his views. His\r\nsingle desire was to set forth with scrupulous accuracy all the facts\r\nwhich belonged to his subject. Some critics will have it that his\r\ntendency towards hero-worship occasionally leads him into extravagance\r\nof statement and that his gorgeous descriptions sometimes blind us to\r\nmost unpleasant facts. This is possibly partly true in the case of\r\n“Ferdinand and Isabella,” his first work, but even in those volumes the\r\nreader will almost always find footnotes to establish the author’s\r\nstatements or to indicate the possibility of a doubt which he himself\r\nfelt. In clear grasp of facts, in vivid powers of narration, combined\r\nwith artistic control of details, no historical writer has exceeded him.\r\nThe power of philosophical analysis he did not possess in so high a\r\ndegree, but no philosophical historian of the first rank was ever so\r\nwidely read as William Hickling Prescott has been and still is.\r\n\r\nFor the additional knowledge concerning the historian, which will\r\nunquestionably be desired after a perusal of his writings, the reader is\r\nreferred to the charming biography, published by George Ticknor in 1864,\r\nand reissued with this edition of Prescott’s works.\r\n\r\nMore than thirty years have elapsed since the last revised edition was\r\npresented to the public. Its editor, Mr. John Foster Kirk, was\r\npre-eminently fitted for his work. He had been Mr. Prescott’s private\r\nsecretary for eleven years, and was perhaps more familiar than was any\r\nother man with the period of Spanish history of which Prescott wrote. He\r\nhad, moreover, himself achieved a most enviable international reputation\r\nby his “Life of Charles the Bold.” In his notes he condensed the\r\nadditional information which a generation of scholars had contributed to\r\nthe subjects treated of in Prescott’s pages. Those notes are all\r\nincorporated in the present edition.\r\n\r\nBut since Kirk’s notes were penned another generation of students has\r\nbeen investigating the history of Spain--a generation which has enjoyed\r\nmore abundant opportunities for research than any scholars before had\r\nknown. Numberless manuscripts have been rescued from monastic limbo, the\r\ncaked dust of centuries has been scraped away from scores of volumes in\r\nthe public archives, and the searchlights of modern scientific\r\ninvestigation have been turned upon places that once seemed hopelessly\r\ndark. As if this were not enough, explorers from many lands have plunged\r\ninto the depths of the Mexican forests, and penetrated the quebradas of\r\nthe Andes, in attempts to wrest from them the secrets of their ancient\r\nhistory.\r\n\r\nThe result is an immense number of volumes filled with statements\r\nstartlingly diverse and with conclusions widely conflicting. Many of\r\nthese volumes, especially those that emanated from the explorers, were\r\nwritten by men unskilled in historical writing,--special pleaders, and\r\nnot historians,--men who were more anxious to demonstrate the soundness\r\nof their own theories than to arrive at absolute knowledge concerning\r\nthe institutions of Peru and of Mexico.\r\n\r\nIt has been the task of the editor of this edition to separate from this\r\nmass of material the conclusions in which scholars for the most part\r\nagree, and to embody those conclusions in additional footnotes. He has\r\nnot ordinarily deemed it necessary to specify the authors read. Because\r\nhe knows that the average reader abhors quotations hurled at him in\r\nunfamiliar tongues, he has, in quoting, always used the best known\r\nauthority in English.\r\n\r\nIn preparing these new volumes for the press the texts of editions\r\npreviously issued have been carefully compared in order to insure\r\nperfect accuracy. In all such matters the publishers have aimed to put\r\nforth Prescott’s writings in the form that must be regarded for many\r\nyears to come as the standard edition of America’s most popular\r\nhistorian.\r\n\r\n                                             WILFRED H. MUNRO.\r\n\r\nBROWN UNIVERSITY,\r\n\r\n   December 20, 1904.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEDITOR’S PREFACE\r\n\r\n\r\nThe publication of Prescott’s second work, “The History of the Conquest\r\nof Mexico,” was justly regarded as the greatest achievement in American\r\nhistorical writing. The theme was not a new one. Other writers had\r\nessayed to tell the story of Hernando Cortés and of the marvellous\r\nempire which that daring and resourceful captain had converted into a\r\nprovince of Spain, but never before had one attempted the task in whom\r\npatient research, careful reflection, and brilliant historical\r\nimagination were so happily blended. The result of Prescott’s labors was\r\nhailed with delight throughout the English-speaking world. His work was\r\nspeedily translated into many languages and his subject acquired an\r\ninterest which it has never since lost. To use the words of another\r\nAmerican scholar,[1] who did not agree with Prescott in many of the\r\nconclusions he reached respecting the so-called Aztec civilization, “It\r\ncalled into existence a larger number of works than was ever before\r\nwritten upon any people of the same number and of the same importance.”\r\n\r\nIn order to appreciate the sensation the book created we must go\r\nbackward almost two generations and place ourselves in a country which\r\nnumbered hardly more than eighteen millions of inhabitants--less people\r\nthan now dwell in the New England States and in the four neighboring\r\nMiddle States,--New York, New Jersey, Pennsylvania, and Delaware. These\r\npeople were for the most part scattered throughout the regions bordering\r\nupon the Atlantic Ocean and the Great Lakes. Comparatively few were to\r\nbe found west of the Mississippi River. Texas was an independent\r\nrepublic. California and the lands adjacent belonged to Mexico. The\r\nownership of the vast region then vaguely known as Oregon had not been\r\nsettled. Alaska was Russian territory. Between the Mississippi and the\r\nSierras of California stretched great wastes of prairie and desert, of\r\nmountain and table-land, which now support millions of people, but which\r\neven so far-seeing a statesman as Daniel Webster then supposed would\r\nnever become fit for human habitation. Communication between even the\r\nmost thickly-settled States was exasperatingly infrequent. The first\r\npublic telegraph line had not been constructed; the railway system of\r\nthe country was still in feeble infancy; letters were carried at so much\r\nper mile and at a very heavy charge; the postage upon books was\r\nexceedingly costly. Only three years had elapsed since the first\r\ntransatlantic steamship line (the Cunard) had started its pioneer vessel\r\nacross the ocean. Newspapers for a long time afterwards headed their\r\ncolumns with announcements of news so many “days later from Europe.”\r\n\r\nYet within a year seven thousand copies of the “Conquest of Mexico” were\r\nsold in this sparsely-settled country, notwithstanding its slow methods\r\nof communication. Boston was acknowledged to be the literary centre of\r\nthe nation, and Prescott, with the modesty which was his marked\r\ncharacteristic, had supposed that the unlooked-for success which had\r\nattended his first literary venture was due to the interest of his\r\npersonal friends in that city of culture. Such a supposition was no\r\nlonger tenable. Nor was it possible to ascribe its great popularity to\r\nthe influence of opinions expressed in Great Britain. The unprecedented\r\nsuccess of the book was due not to personal interest in its author, not\r\nto the favorable judgment of literary Boston, not to the commendation of\r\nthe English reviews, but to the merits of the work itself. A wonderful\r\nstory was told wonderfully well. Men read it and commented upon it as\r\nthey do not comment upon books at the present time. They discussed it\r\nnot only on those rare occasions when they met friends from far away,\r\nbut in the long epistles they sent to those friends,--those letters from\r\nwhich we to-day get so many glimpses of the life of the first half of\r\nthe nineteenth century. It was passed from hand to hand in the\r\ncommunities where only the envied few were able to buy books, but where\r\nall men, in those far less strenuous days, were anxious to read\r\nthem,--in those days also when the average critical judgment concerning\r\ngood literature was more highly developed than it now is, and men were\r\nmuch more given to reflection and discussion than they now are.\r\n\r\nAs has been stated elsewhere, Mr. Prescott was a man of considerable\r\nwealth. He was therefore able to place upon his library tables a much\r\nlarger amount of material with which to work than is ordinarily\r\npossible. Not only did he purchase most of the books published upon his\r\nsubject, but he also secured copies of more valuable documentary\r\nmaterial from the libraries and public archives both of Spain and of\r\nMexico,--in this way gradually accumulating that library which was at\r\nhis death the finest private collection of books in America.\r\n\r\nHis method of composition has already been described. First, his hours\r\nof work with his secretary were scrupulously observed each day; then\r\ncame the hours of reflection and of careful sifting of authorities\r\nbefore pen was placed upon paper, followed by still more careful\r\nreflection before the final copy was written. The tendency to\r\nhero-worship which he shared with most American, and indeed with most\r\nBritish, writers became much less marked as his chapters\r\nincreased,--though surely he may well be pardoned for rejoicing as he\r\ndoes in the exploits of one of the greatest generals in European\r\nhistory. It was perhaps admiration for that great captain which led him\r\nto write the history of his conquests.\r\n\r\nIn reading the “Mexico” we must always remember that the task to which\r\nPrescott devoted his energies was to give an accurate account of the\r\nstupendous campaigns through which Cortés made himself master of the\r\nlands of the Aztecs, and not to describe minutely the institutions\r\nCortés encountered in the Valley of Mexico. An account of the habits,\r\ncustoms, and laws of the people of that valley was essential to a\r\nproper comprehension of the magnitude of the Conquest. That account\r\nPrescott constructed with material gathered from all available sources,\r\nrealizing all the while how very unsatisfactory those sources were. It\r\nfills about half a volume, but, as he says in his first preface, it cost\r\nhim as much labor, and nearly as much time, as all the rest of his\r\nhistory. This part of the work has been subjected to much severe\r\ncriticism, of which mention is made in the notes of this edition. Not a\r\nfew of the conclusions therein set forth have been shown to be\r\nerroneous. For example, Mr. Prescott did not understand the institutions\r\nof the Aztecs. It would have been most marvellous if he had. And yet it\r\nmust be said that, notwithstanding the time spent in research since\r\nPrescott’s introductory chapters were penned, surprisingly little more\r\nis really _known_ to-day concerning the ancient Aztec nation than was\r\nknown at that time. Writers who rejected his conclusions put forth\r\nconjectures without number to supplant them, but most of those\r\nconjectures were not founded upon facts. Their authors were for the most\r\npart theorists, and not simply searchers for truth, as Prescott was.\r\nUntil a larger number of the so-called “Codices” shall have been brought\r\nto light, and men shall have learned to read them as scholars have\r\nlearned to read the hieroglyphics of the East, little more absolute\r\n_knowledge_ is likely to be secured. It is hardly possible, however,\r\nthat many more “Codices” will ever be found. If they exist, they are\r\nprobably lying unnoticed in some obscure monastery in Spain, or under a\r\nmass of material, as yet unclassified, in the public archives of that\r\ncountry. Of the many agencies that have worked for their destruction\r\nthree especially may be noted. First, the climate of the Mexican land,\r\nwith the innumerable insects that a tropical climate breeds; second, the\r\nstern determination of the Mexicans themselves to destroy the memorials\r\nof their ancient state; and, lastly, the holocausts of Zumárraga, first\r\narchbishop of Mexico, whose hand, as Prescott says, “fell more heavily\r\nthan that of time itself upon the Aztec monuments.” This prelate,\r\nemulating in his achievement the auto da fe of Arabic manuscripts which\r\nArchbishop Ximenes had celebrated in Granada twenty years before, burned\r\nall the manuscripts and other idolatrous material he could collect in\r\none great “mountain-heap” in the market-place of Tlatelolco.[2]\r\n\r\nBut when that additional knowledge shall have been attained, it is\r\nhardly likely that any man will attempt to write anew the history of the\r\nSpanish Conquest. The information secured from the rude pictorial\r\ndescriptions of the Aztec scribes and from the chiselled inscriptions of\r\nthe Aztec sculptors will be incorporated as footnotes in subsequent\r\neditions of Prescott’s volumes. For even the critics who arraign\r\nPrescott most severely for his misconception of Aztec institutions admit\r\nthat in everything which he wrote concerning the Conquest and the men\r\nwho took part in it he adhered most carefully to facts and followed\r\nconscientiously the narratives of the participants. Those narratives,\r\nas Prescott’s most prominent critic (Mr. Lewis H. Morgan) admits, “may\r\nbe trusted in whatever relates to the acts of the Spaniards and to the\r\nacts and the personal characteristics of the Indians; in whatever\r\nrelates to their weapons, implements, and utensils, fabrics, food, and\r\nraiment, and things of a similar character.”\r\n\r\nBecause he followed those contemporary writers so carefully, because\r\nwith his vivid historical imagination he was able to transport himself\r\ninto the remote past, to live with the conquering Spaniards the life of\r\ntoil and privation that was sometimes almost beyond their iron\r\nendurance, to share with them their ever-present danger, to rejoice with\r\nthem in their final victories, because so living, sharing, and rejoicing\r\nhe was able to translate their dull stories into pages that sparkle with\r\nthe fulness of life, men will still turn to those pages for the most\r\ngraphic account of the exploits of Cortés and his associates,--for\r\ngenerations yet to come his work will continue to be read as one of the\r\ngreatest masterpieces of descriptive literature.\r\n\r\nW. H. M.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPREFACE\r\n\r\n\r\nAs the Conquest of Mexico has occupied the pens of Solís and of\r\nRobertson, two of the ablest historians of their respective nations, it\r\nmight seem that little could remain at the present day to be gleaned by\r\nthe historical inquirer. But Robertson’s narrative is necessarily brief,\r\nforming only part of a more extended work; and neither the British nor\r\nthe Castilian author was provided with the important materials for\r\nrelating this event which have been since assembled by the industry of\r\nSpanish scholars. The scholar who led the way in these researches was\r\nDon Juan Baptista Muñoz, the celebrated historiographer of the Indies,\r\nwho, by a royal edict, was allowed free access to the national archives,\r\nand to all libraries, public, private, and monastic, in the kingdom and\r\nits colonies. The result of his long labors was a vast body of\r\nmaterials, of which unhappily he did not live to reap the benefit\r\nhimself. His manuscripts were deposited, after his death, in the\r\narchives of the Royal Academy of History at Madrid; and that collection\r\nwas subsequently augmented by the manuscripts of Don Vargas Ponçe,\r\nPresident of the Academy, obtained, like those of Muñoz, from different\r\nquarters, but especially from the archives of the Indies at Seville.\r\n\r\nOn my application to the Academy, in 1838, for permission to copy that\r\npart of this inestimable collection relating to Mexico and Peru, it was\r\nfreely acceded to, and an eminent German scholar, one of their own\r\nnumber, was appointed to superintend the collation and transcription of\r\nthe manuscripts; and this, it may be added, before I had any claim on\r\nthe courtesy of that respectable body, as one of its associates. This\r\nconduct shows the advance of a liberal spirit in the Peninsula since the\r\ntime of Dr. Robertson, who complains that he was denied admission to the\r\nmost important public repositories. The favor with which my own\r\napplication was regarded, however, must chiefly be attributed to the\r\nkind offices of the venerable President of the Academy, Don Martin\r\nFernandez de Navarrete; a scholar whose personal character has secured\r\nto him the same high consideration at home which his literary labors\r\nhave obtained abroad. To this eminent person I am under still further\r\nobligations, for the free use which he has allowed me to make of his own\r\nmanuscripts,--the fruits of a life of accumulation, and the basis of\r\nthose valuable publications with which he has at different times\r\nillustrated the Spanish colonial history.\r\n\r\nFrom these three magnificent collections, the result of half a century’s\r\ncareful researches, I have obtained a mass of unpublished documents,\r\nrelating to the Conquest and Settlement of Mexico and of Peru,\r\ncomprising altogether about eight thousand folio pages. They consist of\r\ninstructions of the Court, military and private journals,\r\ncorrespondence of the great actors in the scenes, legal instruments,\r\ncontemporary chronicles, and the like, drawn from all the principal\r\nplaces in the extensive colonial empire of Spain, as well as from the\r\npublic archives in the Peninsula.\r\n\r\nI have still further fortified the collection by gleaning such materials\r\nfrom Mexico itself as had been overlooked by my illustrious predecessors\r\nin these researches. For these I am indebted to the courtesy of Count\r\nCortina, and, yet more, to that of Don Lúcas Alaman, Minister of Foreign\r\nAffairs in Mexico; but, above all, to my excellent friend, Don Angel\r\nCalderon de la Barca, late Minister Plenipotentiary to that country from\r\nthe court of Madrid,--a gentleman whose high and estimable qualities,\r\neven more than his station, secured him the public confidence, and\r\ngained him free access to every place of interest and importance in\r\nMexico.\r\n\r\nI have also to acknowledge the very kind offices rendered to me by the\r\nCount Camaldoli at Naples; by the Duke of Serradifalco in Sicily, a\r\nnobleman whose science gives additional lustre to his rank; and by the\r\nDuke of Monteleone, the present representative of Cortés, who has\r\ncourteously opened the archives of his family to my inspection. To these\r\nnames must also be added that of Sir Thomas Phillips, Bart., whose\r\nprecious collection of manuscripts probably surpasses in extent that of\r\nany private gentleman in Great Britain, if not in Europe; that of M.\r\nTernaux-Compans, the proprietor of the valuable literary collection of\r\nDon Antonio Uguina, including the papers of Muñoz, the fruits of which\r\nhe is giving to the world in his excellent translations; and, lastly,\r\nthat of my friend and countryman, Arthur Middleton, Esq., late\r\nChargé-d’Affaires from the United States at the court of Madrid, for the\r\nefficient aid he has afforded me in prosecuting my inquiries in that\r\ncapital.\r\n\r\nIn addition to this stock of original documents obtained through these\r\nvarious sources, I have diligently provided myself with such printed\r\nworks as have reference to the subject, including the magnificent\r\npublications, which have appeared both in France and England, on the\r\nAntiquities of Mexico, which, from their cost and colossal dimensions,\r\nwould seem better suited to a public than to a private library.\r\n\r\nHaving thus stated the nature of my materials, and the sources whence\r\nthey are derived, it remains for me to add a few observations on the\r\ngeneral plan and composition of the work. Among the remarkable\r\nachievements of the Spaniards in the sixteenth century, there is no one\r\nmore striking to the imagination than the conquest of Mexico. The\r\nsubversion of a great empire by a handful of adventurers, taken with all\r\nits strange and picturesque accompaniments, has the air of romance\r\nrather than of sober history; and it is not easy to treat such a theme\r\naccording to the severe rules prescribed by historical criticism. But,\r\nnotwithstanding the seductions of the subject, I have conscientiously\r\nendeavored to distinguish fact from fiction, and to establish the\r\nnarrative on as broad a basis as possible of contemporary evidence; and\r\nI have taken occasion to corroborate the text by ample citations from\r\nauthorities, usually in the original, since few of them can be very\r\naccessible to the reader. In these extracts I have scrupulously\r\nconformed to the ancient orthography, however obsolete and even\r\nbarbarous, rather than impair in any degree the integrity of the\r\noriginal document.\r\n\r\nAlthough the subject of the work is, properly, only the Conquest of\r\nMexico, I have prepared the way for it by such a view of the\r\ncivilization of the ancient Mexicans as might acquaint the reader with\r\nthe character of this extraordinary race, and enable him to understand\r\nthe difficulties which the Spaniards had to encounter in their\r\nsubjugation. This Introductory part of the work, with the essay in the\r\nAppendix which properly belongs to the Introduction,[3] although both\r\ntogether making only half a volume, has cost me as much labor, and\r\nnearly as much time, as the remainder of the history. If I shall have\r\nsucceeded in giving the reader a just idea of the true nature and extent\r\nof the civilization to which the Mexicans had attained, it will not be\r\nlabor lost.\r\n\r\nThe story of the Conquest terminates with the fall of the capital. Yet I\r\nhave preferred to continue the narrative to the death of Cortés, relying\r\non the interest which the development of his character in his military\r\ncareer may have excited in the reader. I am not insensible to the hazard\r\nI incur by such a course. The mind, previously occupied with one great\r\nidea, that of the subversion of the capital, may feel the prolongation\r\nof the story beyond that point superfluous, if not tedious, and may find\r\nit difficult, after the excitement caused by witnessing a great national\r\ncatastrophe, to take an interest in the adventures of a private\r\nindividual. Solís took the more politic course of concluding his\r\nnarrative with the fall of Mexico, and thus leaves his readers with the\r\nfull impression of that memorable event, undisturbed, on their minds. To\r\nprolong the narrative is to expose the historian to the error so much\r\ncensured by the French critics in some of their most celebrated dramas,\r\nwhere the author by a premature _dénouement_ has impaired the interest\r\nof his piece. It is the defect that necessarily attaches, though in a\r\ngreater degree, to the history of Columbus, in which petty adventures\r\namong a group of islands make up the sequel of a life that opened with\r\nthe magnificent discovery of a World,--a defect, in short, which it has\r\nrequired all the genius of Irving and the magical charm of his style\r\nperfectly to overcome.\r\n\r\nNotwithstanding these objections, I have been induced to continue the\r\nnarrative, partly from deference to the opinion of several Spanish\r\nscholars, who considered that the biography of Cortés had not been fully\r\nexhibited, and partly from the circumstance of my having such a body of\r\noriginal materials for this biography at my command. And I cannot regret\r\nthat I have adopted this course; since, whatever lustre the Conquest may\r\nreflect on Cortés as a military achievement, it gives but an imperfect\r\nidea of his enlightened spirit and of his comprehensive and versatile\r\ngenius.\r\n\r\nTo the eye of the critic there may seem some incongruity in a plan which\r\ncombines objects so dissimilar as those embraced by the present history,\r\nwhere the Introduction, occupied by the antiquities and origin of a\r\nnation, has somewhat the character of a _philosophic_ theme, while the\r\nconclusion is strictly _biographical_, and the two may be supposed to\r\nmatch indifferently with the main body, or _historical_ portion of the\r\nwork. But I may hope that such objections will be found to have less\r\nweight in practice than in theory; and, if properly managed, that the\r\ngeneral views of the Introduction will prepare the reader for the\r\nparticulars of the Conquest, and that the great public events narrated\r\nin this will, without violence, open the way to the remaining personal\r\nhistory of the hero who is the soul of it. Whatever incongruity may\r\nexist in other respects, I may hope that the _unity of interest_, the\r\nonly unity held of much importance by modern critics, will be found\r\nstill to be preserved.\r\n\r\nThe distance of the present age from the period of the narrative might\r\nbe presumed to secure the historian from undue prejudice or partiality.\r\nYet by the American and the English reader, acknowledging so different a\r\nmoral standard from that of the sixteenth century, I may possibly be\r\nthought too indulgent to the errors of the Conquerors; while by a\r\nSpaniard, accustomed to the undiluted panegyric of Solís, I may be\r\ndeemed to have dealt too hardly with them. To such I can only say that,\r\nwhile, on the one hand, I have not hesitated to expose in their\r\nstrongest colors the excesses of the Conquerors, on the other, I have\r\ngiven them the benefit of such mitigating reflections as might be\r\nsuggested by the circumstances and the period in which they lived. I\r\nhave endeavored not only to present a picture true in itself, but to\r\nplace it in its proper light, and to put the spectator in a proper point\r\nof view for seeing it to the best advantage. I have endeavored, at the\r\nexpense of some repetition, to surround him with the spirit of the\r\ntimes, and, in a word, to make him, if I may so express myself, a\r\ncontemporary of the sixteenth century. Whether, and how far, I have\r\nsucceeded in this, he must determine.\r\n\r\nFor one thing, before I conclude, I may reasonably ask the reader’s\r\nindulgence. Owing to the state of my eyes, I have been obliged to use a\r\nwriting-case made for the blind, which does not permit the writer to see\r\nhis own manuscript. Nor have I ever corrected, or even read, my own\r\noriginal draft. As the chirography, under these disadvantages, has been\r\ntoo often careless and obscure, occasional errors, even with the utmost\r\ncare of my secretary, must have necessarily occurred in the\r\ntranscription, somewhat increased by the barbarous phraseology imported\r\nfrom my Mexican authorities. I cannot expect that these errors have\r\nalways been detected even by the vigilant eye of the perspicacious\r\ncritic to whom the proof-sheets have been subjected.\r\n\r\nIn the Preface to the “History of Ferdinand and Isabella,” I lamented\r\nthat, while occupied with that subject, two of its most attractive\r\nparts had engaged the attention of the most popular of American authors,\r\nWashington Irving. By a singular chance, something like the reverse of\r\nthis has taken place in the composition of the present history, and I\r\nhave found myself unconsciously taking up ground which he was preparing\r\nto occupy. It was not till I had become master of my rich collection of\r\nmaterials that I was acquainted with this circumstance; and, had he\r\npersevered in his design, I should unhesitatingly have abandoned my own,\r\nif not from courtesy, at least from policy; for, though armed with the\r\nweapons of Achilles, this could give me no hope of success in a\r\ncompetition with Achilles himself. But no sooner was that distinguished\r\nwriter informed of the preparations I had made, than, with the\r\ngentlemanly spirit which will surprise no one who has the pleasure of\r\nhis acquaintance, he instantly announced to me his intention of leaving\r\nthe subject open to me. While I do but justice to Mr. Irving by this\r\nstatement, I feel the prejudice it does to myself in the unavailing\r\nregret I am exciting in the bosom of the reader.\r\n\r\nI must not conclude this Preface, too long protracted as it is already,\r\nwithout a word of acknowledgment to my friend George Ticknor, Esq., the\r\nfriend of many years,--for his patient revision of my manuscript; a\r\nlabor of love, the worth of which those only can estimate who are\r\nacquainted with his extraordinary erudition and his nice critical taste.\r\nIf I have reserved his name for the last in the list of those to whose\r\ngood offices I am indebted, it is most assuredly not because I value\r\nhis services least.\r\n\r\nWILLIAM H.

It is the purpose of the\r\npresent narrative to exhibit the history of this Conquest, and that of\r\nthe remarkable man by whom it was achieved.\r\n\r\nBut, in order that the reader may have a better understanding of the\r\nsubject, it will be well, before entering on it, to take a general\r\nsurvey of the political and social institutions of the races who\r\noccupied the land at the time of its discovery.\r\n\r\nThe country of the ancient Mexicans, or Aztecs as they were called,\r\nformed but a very small part of the extensive territories comprehended\r\nin the modern republic of Mexico.[4] Its boundaries cannot be defined\r\nwith certainty. They were much enlarged in the latter days of the\r\nempire, when they may be considered as reaching from about the\r\neighteenth degree north, to the twenty-first, on the Atlantic; and from\r\nthe fourteenth to the nineteenth, including a very narrow strip, on the\r\nPacific.[5] In its greatest breadth, it could not exceed five degrees\r\nand a half, dwindling, as it approached its southeastern limits, to less\r\nthan two. It covered, probably, less than sixteen thousand square\r\nleagues.[6] Yet such is the remarkable formation of this country, that,\r\nthough not more than twice as large as New England, it presented every\r\nvariety of climate, and was capable of yielding nearly every fruit,\r\nfound between the equator and the Arctic circle.\r\n\r\nAll along the Atlantic, the country is bordered by a broad tract, called\r\nthe _tierra caliente_, or hot region, which has the usual high\r\ntemperature of equinoctial lands. Parched and sandy plains are\r\nintermingled with others, of exuberant fertility, almost impervious from\r\nthickets of aromatic shrubs and wild flowers, in the midst of which\r\ntower up trees of that magnificent growth which is found only within\r\nthe tropics. In this wilderness of sweets lurks the fatal _malaria_,\r\nengendered, probably, by the decomposition of rank vegetable substances\r\nin a hot and humid soil.[7] The season of the bilious fever,--_vómito_,\r\nas it is called,--which scourges these coasts, continues from the spring\r\nto the autumnal equinox, when it is checked by the cold winds that\r\ndescend from Hudson’s Bay. These winds in the winter season frequently\r\nfreshen into tempests, and sweeping down the Atlantic coast and the\r\nwinding Gulf of Mexico, burst with the fury of a hurricane on its\r\nunprotected shores, and on the neighboring West India islands. Such are\r\nthe mighty spells with which Nature has surrounded this land of\r\nenchantment, as if to guard the golden treasures locked up within its\r\nbosom. The genius and enterprise of man have proved more potent than her\r\nspells.\r\n\r\nAfter passing some twenty leagues across this burning region, the\r\ntraveller finds himself rising into a purer atmosphere. His limbs\r\nrecover their elasticity. He breathes more freely, for his senses are\r\nnot now oppressed by the sultry heats and intoxicating perfumes of the\r\nvalley. The aspect of nature, too, has changed, and his eye no longer\r\nrevels among the gay variety of colors with which the landscape was\r\npainted there. The vanilla, the indigo, and the flowering cacao-groves\r\ndisappear as he advances. The sugar-cane and the glossy-leaved banana\r\nstill accompany him; and, when he has ascended about four thousand\r\nfeet, he sees in the unchanging verdure, and the rich foliage of the\r\nliquid-amber tree, that he has reached the height where clouds and mists\r\nsettle, in their passage from the Mexican Gulf. This is the region of\r\nperpetual humidity; but he welcomes it with pleasure, as announcing his\r\nescape from the influence of the deadly _vómito_.[8] He has entered the\r\n_tierra templada_, or temperate region, whose character resembles that\r\nof the temperate zone of the globe. The features of the scenery become\r\ngrand, and even terrible. His road sweeps along the base of mighty\r\nmountains, once gleaming with volcanic fires, and still resplendent in\r\ntheir mantles of snow, which serve as beacons to the mariner, for many a\r\nleague at sea. All around he beholds traces of their ancient combustion,\r\nas his road passes along vast tracts of lava, bristling in the\r\ninnumerable fantastic forms into which the fiery torrent has been thrown\r\nby the obstacles in its career. Perhaps, at the same moment, as he casts\r\nhis eye down some steep slope, or almost unfathomable ravine, on the\r\nmargin of the road, he sees their depths glowing with the rich blooms\r\nand enamelled vegetation of the tropics. Such are the singular contrasts\r\npresented, at the same time, to the senses, in this picturesque region!\r\n\r\nStill pressing upwards, the traveller mounts into other climates,\r\nfavorable to other kinds of cultivation. The yellow maize, or Indian\r\ncorn, as we usually call it, has continued to follow him up from the\r\nlowest level; but he now first sees fields of wheat, and the other\r\nEuropean grains brought into the country by the Conquerors. Mingled with\r\nthem, he views the plantations of the aloe or maguey (_agave\r\nAmericana_), applied to such various and important uses by the Aztecs.\r\nThe oaks now acquire a sturdier growth, and the dark forests of pine\r\nannounce that he has entered the _tierra fria_, or cold region,--the\r\nthird and last of the great natural terraces into which the country is\r\ndivided. When he has climbed to the height of between seven and eight\r\nthousand feet, the weary traveller sets his foot on the summit of the\r\nCordillera of the Andes,--the colossal range that, after traversing\r\nSouth America and the Isthmus of Darien, spreads out, as it enters\r\nMexico, into that vast sheet of table-land which maintains an elevation\r\nof more than six thousand feet, for the distance of nearly two hundred\r\nleagues, until it gradually declines in the higher latitudes of the\r\nnorth.[9]\r\n\r\nAcross this mountain rampart a chain of volcanic hills stretches, in a\r\nwesterly direction, of still more stupendous dimensions, forming,\r\nindeed, some of the highest land on the globe. Their peaks, entering the\r\nlimits of perpetual snow, diffuse a grateful coolness over the elevated\r\nplateaus below; for these last, though termed “cold,” enjoy a climate\r\nthe mean temperature of which is not lower than that of the central\r\nparts of Italy.[10] The air is exceedingly dry; the soil, though\r\nnaturally good, is rarely clothed with the luxuriant vegetation of the\r\nlower regions. It frequently, indeed, has a parched and barren aspect,\r\nowing partly to the greater evaporation which takes place on these lofty\r\nplains, through the diminished pressure of the atmosphere, and partly,\r\nno doubt, to the want of trees to shelter the soil from the fierce\r\ninfluence of the summer sun. In the time of the Aztecs, the table-land\r\nwas thickly covered with larch, oak, cypress, and other forest trees,\r\nthe extraordinary dimensions of some of which, remaining to the present\r\nday, show that the curse of barrenness in later times is chargeable more\r\non man than on nature. Indeed, the early Spaniards made as\r\nindiscriminate war on the forest as did our Puritan ancestors, though\r\nwith much less reason. After once conquering the country, they had no\r\nlurking ambush to fear from the submissive, semi-civilized Indian, and\r\nwere not, like our forefathers, obliged to keep watch and ward for a\r\ncentury. This spoliation of the ground, however, is said to have been\r\npleasing to their imaginations, as it reminded them of the plains of\r\ntheir own Castile,--the table-land of Europe;[11] where the nakedness of\r\nthe landscape forms the burden of every traveller’s lament who visits\r\nthat country.\r\n\r\nMidway across the continent, somewhat nearer the Pacific than the\r\nAtlantic Ocean, at an elevation of nearly seven thousand five hundred\r\nfeet, is the celebrated Valley of Mexico. It is of an oval form, about\r\nsixty-seven leagues in circumference,[12] and is encompassed by a\r\ntowering rampart of porphyritic rock, which nature seems to have\r\nprovided, though ineffectually, to protect it from invasion.\r\n\r\nThe soil, once carpeted with a beautiful verdure and thickly sprinkled\r\nwith stately trees, is often bare, and, in many places, white with the\r\nincrustation of salts caused by the draining of the waters. Five lakes\r\nare spread over the Valley, occupying one-tenth of its surface.[13] On\r\nthe opposite borders of the largest of these basins, much shrunk in its\r\ndimensions[14] since the days of the Aztecs, stood the cities of Mexico\r\nand Tezcuco, the capitals of the two most potent and flourishing states\r\nof Anahuac, whose history, with that of the mysterious races that\r\npreceded them in the country,[15] exhibits some of the nearest\r\napproaches to civilization to be met with anciently on the North\r\nAmerican continent.\r\n\r\nOf these races the most conspicuous were the Toltecs. Advancing from a\r\nnortherly direction, but from what region is uncertain,[16] they entered\r\nthe territory of Anahuac,[17] probably before the close of the seventh\r\ncentury. Of course, little can be gleaned with certainty respecting a\r\npeople whose written records have perished, and who are known to us only\r\nthrough the traditionary legends of the nations that succeeded them.[18]\r\nBy the general agreement of these, however, the Toltecs were well\r\ninstructed in agriculture and many of the most useful mechanic arts;\r\nwere nice workers of metals; invented the complex arrangement of time\r\nadopted by the Aztecs; and, in short, were the true fountains of the\r\ncivilization which distinguished this part of the continent in later\r\ntimes.[19] They established their capital at Tula, north of the Mexican\r\nValley, and the remains of extensive buildings were to be discerned\r\nthere at the time of the Conquest.[20] The noble ruins of religious and\r\nother edifices, still to be seen in various parts of New Spain, are\r\nreferred to this people, whose name, _Toltec_, has passed into a synonym\r\nfor _architect_.[21] Their shadowy history reminds us of those primitive\r\nraces who preceded the ancient Egyptians in the march of civilization;\r\nfragments of whose monuments, as they are seen at this day, incorporated\r\nwith the buildings of the Egyptians themselves, give to these latter the\r\nappearance of almost modern constructions.[22]\r\n\r\nAfter a period of four centuries, the Toltecs, who had extended their\r\nsway over the remotest borders of Anahuac,[23] having been greatly\r\nreduced, it is said, by famine, pestilence, and unsuccessful wars,\r\ndisappeared from the land as silently and mysteriously as they had\r\nentered it. A few of them still lingered behind, but much the greater\r\nnumber, probably, spread over the region of Central America and the\r\nneighboring isles; and the traveller now speculates on the majestic\r\nruins of Mitla and Palenque, as possibly the work of this extraordinary\r\npeople.[24][25]\r\n\r\nAfter the lapse of another hundred years, a numerous and rude tribe,\r\ncalled the Chichimecs, entered the deserted country from the regions of\r\nthe far Northwest. They were speedily followed by other races, of higher\r\ncivilization, perhaps of the same family with the Toltecs, whose\r\nlanguage they appear to have spoken. The most noted of these were the\r\nAztecs or Mexicans, and the Acolhuans. The latter, better known in later\r\ntimes by the name of Tezcucans, from their capital, Tezcuco,[26] on the\r\neastern border of the Mexican lake, were peculiarly fitted, by their\r\ncomparatively mild religion and manners, for receiving the tincture of\r\ncivilization which could be derived from the few Toltecs that still\r\nremained in the country.[27] This, in their turn, they communicated to\r\nthe barbarous Chichimecs, a large portion of whom became amalgamated\r\nwith the new settlers as one nation.[28]\r\n\r\nAvailing themselves of the strength derived, not only from this\r\nincrease of numbers, but from their own superior refinement, the\r\nAcolhuans gradually stretched their empire over the ruder tribes in the\r\nnorth; while their capital was filled with a numerous population, busily\r\nemployed in many of the more useful and even elegant arts of a civilized\r\ncommunity. In this palmy state, they were suddenly assaulted by a\r\nwarlike neighbor, the Tepanecs, their own kindred, and inhabitants of\r\nthe same valley as themselves. Their provinces were overrun, their\r\narmies beaten, their king assassinated, and the flourishing city of\r\nTezcuco became the prize of the victor. From this abject condition the\r\nuncommon abilities of the young prince, Nezahualcoyotl, the rightful\r\nheir to the crown, backed by the efficient aid of his Mexican allies, at\r\nlength redeemed the state, and opened to it a new career of prosperity,\r\neven more brilliant than the former.[29]\r\n\r\nThe Mexicans, with whom our history is principally concerned, came also,\r\nas we have seen, from the remote regions of the North,--the populous\r\nhive of nations in the New World, as it has been in the Old.[30] They\r\narrived on the borders of Anahuac towards the beginning of the\r\nthirteenth century, some time after the occupation of the land by the\r\nkindred races. For a long time they did not establish themselves in any\r\npermanent residence, but continued shifting their quarters to different\r\nparts of the Mexican Valley, enduring all the casualties and hardships\r\nof a migratory life. On one occasion they were enslaved by a more\r\npowerful tribe; but their ferocity soon made them formidable to their\r\nmasters.[31] After a series of wanderings and adventures which need not\r\nshrink from comparison with the most extravagant legends of the heroic\r\nages of antiquity, they at length halted on the southwestern borders of\r\nthe principal lake, in the year 1325. They there beheld, perched on the\r\nstem of a prickly pear, which shot out from the crevice of a rock that\r\nwas washed by the waves, a royal eagle of extraordinary size and beauty,\r\nwith a serpent in his talons, and his broad wings opened to the rising\r\nsun. They hailed the auspicious omen, announced by an oracle as\r\nindicating the site of their future city, and laid its foundations by\r\nsinking piles into the shallows; for the low marshes were half buried\r\nunder water. On these they erected their light fabrics of reeds and\r\nrushes, and sought a precarious subsistence from fishing, and from the\r\nwild fowl which frequented the waters, as well as from the cultivation\r\nof such simple vegetables as they could raise on their floating gardens.\r\nThe place was called Tenochtitlan, in token of its miraculous origin,\r\nthough only known to Europeans by its other name of Mexico,[32] derived\r\nfrom their war-god, Mexitli.[33] The legend of its foundation is still\r\nfurther commemorated by the device of the eagle and the cactus, which\r\nform the arms of the modern Mexican republic. Such were the humble\r\nbeginnings of the Venice of the Western World.[34][35]\r\n\r\nThe forlorn condition of the new settlers was made still worse by\r\ndomestic feuds. A part of the citizens seceded from the main body, and\r\nformed a separate community on the neighboring marshes. Thus divided, it\r\nwas long before they could aspire to the acquisition of territory on the\r\nmain land. They gradually increased, however, in numbers, and\r\nstrengthened themselves yet more by various improvements in their polity\r\nand military discipline, while they established a reputation for courage\r\nas well as cruelty in war which made their name terrible throughout the\r\nValley. In the early part of the fifteenth century, nearly a hundred\r\nyears from the foundation of the city, an event took place which created\r\nan entire revolution in the circumstances and, to some extent, in the\r\ncharacter of the Aztecs. This was the subversion of the Tezcucan\r\nmonarchy by the Tepanecs, already noticed. When the oppressive conduct\r\nof the victors had at length aroused a spirit of resistance, its prince,\r\nNezahualcoyotl, succeeded, after incredible perils and escapes, in\r\nmustering such a force as, with the aid of the Mexicans, placed him on a\r\nlevel with his enemies. In two successive battles, these were defeated\r\nwith great slaughter, their chief slain, and their territory, by one of\r\nthose sudden reverses which characterize the wars of petty states,\r\npassed into the hands of the conquerors. It was awarded to Mexico, in\r\nreturn for its important services.[36]\r\n\r\nThen was formed that remarkable league, which, indeed, has no parallel\r\nin history. It was agreed between the states of Mexico, Tezcuco, and the\r\nneighboring little kingdom of Tlacopan, that they should mutually\r\nsupport each other in their wars, offensive and defensive, and that in\r\nthe distribution of the spoil one-fifth should be assigned to Tlacopan,\r\nand the remainder be divided, in what proportions is uncertain, between\r\nthe other powers. The Tezcucan writers claim an equal share for their\r\nnation with the Aztecs. But this does not seem to be warranted by the\r\nimmense increase of territory subsequently appropriated by the latter.\r\nAnd we may account for any advantage conceded to them by the treaty, on\r\nthe supposition that, however inferior they may have been originally,\r\nthey were, at the time of making it, in a more prosperous condition than\r\ntheir allies, broken and dispirited by long oppression. What is more\r\nextraordinary than the treaty itself, however, is the fidelity with\r\nwhich it was maintained. During a century of uninterrupted warfare that\r\nensued, no instance occurred where the parties quarrelled over the\r\ndivision of the spoil, which so often makes shipwreck of similar\r\nconfederacies among civilized states.[37]\r\n\r\nThe allies for some time found sufficient occupation for their arms in\r\ntheir own valley; but they soon overleaped its rocky ramparts, and by\r\nthe middle of the fifteenth century, under the first Montezuma, had\r\nspread down the sides of the table-land to the borders of the Gulf of\r\nMexico. Tenochtitlan, the Aztec capital, gave evidence of the public\r\nprosperity. Its frail tenements were supplanted by solid structures of\r\nstone and lime. Its population rapidly increased. Its old feuds were\r\nhealed. The citizens who had seceded were again brought under a common\r\ngovernment with the main body, and the quarter they occupied was\r\npermanently connected with the parent city; the dimensions of which,\r\ncovering the same ground, were much larger than those of the modern\r\ncapital of Mexico.[38][39]\r\n\r\nFortunately, the throne was filled by a succession of able princes, who\r\nknew how to profit by their enlarged resources and by the martial\r\nenthusiasm of the nation. Year after year saw them return, loaded with\r\nthe spoils of conquered cities, and with throngs of devoted captives, to\r\ntheir capital. No state was able long to resist the accumulated strength\r\nof the confederates. At the beginning of the sixteenth century, just\r\nbefore the arrival of the Spaniards, the Aztec dominion reached across\r\nthe continent, from the Atlantic to the Pacific, and, under the bold and\r\nbloody Ahuitzotl, its arms had been carried far over the limits already\r\nnoticed as defining its permanent territory, into the farthest corners\r\nof Guatemala and Nicaragua. This extent of empire, however limited in\r\ncomparison with that of many other states, is truly wonderful,\r\nconsidering it as the acquisition of a people whose whole population and\r\nresources had so recently been comprised within the walls of their own\r\npetty city, and considering, moreover, that the conquered territory was\r\nthickly settled by various races, bred to arms like the Mexicans, and\r\nlittle inferior to them in social organization. The history of the\r\nAztecs suggests some strong points of resemblance to that of the ancient\r\nRomans, not only in their military successes, but in the policy which\r\nled to them.[40]\r\n\r\n     The most important contribution, of late years, to the early\r\n     history of Mexico is the _Historia antigua_ of the Lic. Don.\r\n     Mariano Veytia, published in the city of Mexico, in 1836. This\r\n     scholar was born of an ancient and highly respectable family at\r\n     Puebla, 1718. After finishing his academic education, he went to\r\n     Spain, where he was kindly received at court. He afterwards visited\r\n     several other countries of Europe, made himself acquainted with\r\n     their languages, and returned home well stored with the fruits of a\r\n     discriminating observation and diligent study. The rest of his life\r\n     he devoted to letters; especially to the illustration of the\r\n     national history and antiquities. As the executor of the\r\n     unfortunate Boturini, with whom he had contracted an intimacy in\r\n     Madrid, he obtained access to his valuable collection of\r\n     manuscripts in Mexico, and from them, and every other source which\r\n     his position in society and his eminent character opened to him, he\r\n     composed various works, none of which, however, except the one\r\n     before us, has been admitted to the honors of the press. The time\r\n     of his death is not given by his editor, but it was probably not\r\n     later than 1780.\r\n\r\n     Veytia’s history covers the whole period from the first occupation\r\n     of Anahuac to the middle of the fifteenth century, at which point\r\n     his labors were unfortunately terminated by his death. In the early\r\n     portion he has endeavored to trace the migratory movements and\r\n     historical annals of the principal races who entered the country.\r\n     Every page bears testimony to the extent and fidelity of his\r\n     researches; and, if we feel but moderate confidence in the results,\r\n     the fault is not imputable to him, so much as to the dark and\r\n     doubtful nature of the subject. As he descends to later ages, he is\r\n     more occupied with the fortunes of the Tezcucan than with those of\r\n     the Aztec dynasty, which have been amply discussed by others of his\r\n     countrymen. The premature close of his labors prevented him,\r\n     probably, from giving that attention to the domestic institutions\r\n     of the people he describes, to which they are entitled as the most\r\n     important subject of inquiry to the historian. The deficiency has\r\n     been supplied by his judicious editor, Orteaga, from other sources.\r\n     In the early part of his work, Veytia has explained the\r\n     chronological system of the Aztecs, but, like most writers\r\n     preceding the accurate Gama, with indifferent success. As a critic,\r\n     he certainly ranks much higher than the annalists who preceded him,\r\n     and, when his own religion is not involved, shows a discriminating\r\n     judgment. When it is, he betrays a full measure of the credulity\r\n     which still maintains its hold on too many even of the\r\n     well-informed of his countrymen. The editor of the work has given a\r\n     very interesting letter from the Abbé Clavigero to Veytia, written\r\n     when the former was a poor and humble exile, and in the tone of one\r\n     addressing a person of high standing and literary eminence. Both\r\n     were employed on the same subject. The writings of the poor abbé,\r\n     published again and again, and translated into various languages,\r\n     have spread his fame throughout Europe; while the name of Veytia,\r\n     whose works have been locked up in their primitive manuscript, is\r\n     scarcely known beyond the boundaries of Mexico.\r\n\r\n     [The opinions set forth by Mr. Prescott respecting the Mexican\r\n     empire were attacked with much vigor by Lewis H. Morgan. Mr. Morgan\r\n     demonstrated conclusively that many of those opinions were\r\n     erroneous. But, as Payne says in his History of the New World\r\n     called America, vol i. p. 306, “his results cannot be regarded as\r\n     satisfactory, much less as final.” The Spanish chroniclers Prescott\r\n     consulted were correct ordinarily in their statement of facts, but\r\n     were misleading in their conclusions because of their inability to\r\n     comprehend the Aztec institutions.\r\n\r\n     On the pueblo as the unit of aboriginal history, see Payne, vol. i.\r\n     pp. 36-47.\r\n\r\n     In his Ancient Society, p. 186, Mr. Morgan says: “The histories of\r\n     Spanish America may be trusted in whatever relates to the acts of\r\n     the Spaniards, and to the acts and personal characteristics of the\r\n     Indians; in whatever relates to their weapons, implements and\r\n     utensils, fabrics, food and raiment, and things of a similar\r\n     character. But in whatever relates to Indian society and\r\n     government, their social relations and plan of life, they are\r\n     nearly worthless, because they learned nothing and knew nothing of\r\n     either. We are at full liberty to reject them in these respects and\r\n     commence anew, using any facts they may contain which harmonize\r\n     with what is known of Indian society.” He does not, however, always\r\n     observe his own rules if those rules seem to militate against the\r\n     thesis he is endeavoring to establish. Moreover, he is so dogmatic\r\n     in his statements and so confident in the infallibility of his own\r\n     judgment, that the reader who is seeking simply to ascertain the\r\n     truth about the whole matter is oftentimes intensely exasperated\r\n     with him. This is especially true with respect to the famous essay\r\n     on “Montezuma’s Dinner,” where he writes almost as though he had\r\n     been a guest at the banquet and had partaken of the viands which\r\n     were there consumed. As Mr. Morgan may justly be regarded as the\r\n     founder of a school, it is well to state his views at length.\r\n\r\n     According to him, then, there was no kingdom or empire of Mexico.\r\n     There was simply a confederacy of three tribes, and this\r\n     confederacy was a military democracy. The governmental powers were\r\n     vested in a council of chiefs with a general commander. The council\r\n     exercised all civil power, the military power being left in the\r\n     hands of the war chief. There were no feudal castles inhabited by\r\n     lawless lords. There were only great communal houses tenanted by\r\n     clans.\r\n\r\n     In his brilliant work on Ancient Society, Mr. Morgan places below\r\n     civilization two stages of development--savagery and barbarism. The\r\n     invention of pottery marks the difference between these two stages.\r\n     The savage makes no pottery. When the women of the savage tribes\r\n     used vessels of fire-hardened clay for boiling their food they had\r\n     passed into the first stage of barbarism. Elsewhere there were\r\n     pastoral stages of development. In North America there were none.\r\n     The only domesticated animal its inhabitants possessed when the\r\n     Europeans landed on the continent was the dog. The first stage of\r\n     barbarism in North America was marked by the cultivation of maize\r\n     or Indian corn. This grain can be cultivated more easily than any\r\n     other cereal. No other yields such enormous returns. In virgin soil\r\n     it is only necessary to drop the seed into the earth. Nature cares\r\n     for its complete development. But virgin soil becomes exhausted in\r\n     a few years. As population becomes denser and migrations cease to\r\n     be practicable, the land must be more carefully tilled, and, where\r\n     rains are comparatively infrequent, must be irrigated. Irrigation\r\n     and the use of adobe (sun-dried brick) and stone in building mark\r\n     the beginning of the second period of barbarism. In this period\r\n     also tools of stone give place to those of metal, the metal used in\r\n     America being copper. The Aztecs, the Mayas, and, in South America,\r\n     the Peruvians were in the second period. But to the third period,\r\n     when the smelting of iron ore was invented, these people never\r\n     passed.\r\n\r\n     The invention of a phonetic alphabet and the use of written\r\n     records, Mr. Morgan thinks, mark the beginning of civilization.\r\n     But, as John Fiske points out, it will not do to insist too\r\n     narrowly upon the phonetic alphabet. Hieroglyphics have perpetuated\r\n     much historic record in Egypt and China. Although the Mexicans and\r\n     Central Americans did not smelt iron ore, they yet possessed\r\n     historic records in their hieroglyphics (hieroglyphics which may\r\n     still be read). They were then enjoying civilization of an\r\n     extremely rude type, combined with a marvellously developed\r\n     barbarism. For though their barbarism was marked by human\r\n     sacrifices and by cannibalism, yet, according to testimony which\r\n     Mr. Morgan says may be taken at its face value, these barbarians\r\n     had pleasure-gardens and fountains, baths, menageries, feather-work\r\n     that was marvellously beautiful, pottery that showed admirable\r\n     taste, vessels of gold and silver, and many other accessories of an\r\n     advanced civilization.\r\n\r\n     Mr. Morgan was adopted into the Seneca tribe of North American\r\n     Indians, and he was able to study Indian institutions from an\r\n     inside point of view. Unquestionably he had a more profound\r\n     knowledge of those institutions than any other scholar of his time.\r\n     But he went too far when he confined the Aztecs to the narrow\r\n     limits in development to which the Senecas had attained. Moreover,\r\n     he does not make due allowance for the changes in development which\r\n     the more favorable climate of the Mexican table-lands brought\r\n     about. The “long house” of the Iroquois may have been constructed\r\n     on the same general plan, but it could hardly have been mistaken\r\n     for the building in which Montezuma quartered Cortés and his\r\n     allies. The one meal, freshly cooked and eaten about midday, bore\r\n     but little resemblance to the banquets in Mexico described with\r\n     such watery appreciation by the Spanish chroniclers. (Morgan admits\r\n     that these same chroniclers may be trusted when they write of food\r\n     and other such palpable matters.)\r\n\r\n     But Mr. Morgan is unquestionably right in saying that Montezuma’s\r\n     so-called “empire” was really a confederacy of tribes--living in\r\n     pueblos, governed by a council of chiefs, and levying tribute upon\r\n     other pueblos. The Aztec confederacy dominated the Mexican land as\r\n     the Iroquois confederacy dominated the region between the\r\n     Connecticut and the Mississippi. To assert that otherwise the two\r\n     nations were alike both in their institutions and in their\r\n     development is as unwarranted as to say that the governmental\r\n     institutions and the political development of the United States and\r\n     Venezuela are identical.\r\n\r\n     How did this confederacy come to be formed?\r\n\r\n     The earliest family group was the clan. As Sir Henry Maine points\r\n     out in his Ancient Law, the individual was nothing in ancient\r\n     society, the state was nothing, the family was everything. This\r\n     statement holds good everywhere, for America as well as for India.\r\n     A group of clans made up a phratry or brotherhood; a group of\r\n     phratries made a tribe. This threefold grouping was universal. The\r\n     Greek phratry, the Roman curia, the Teutonic hundred were analogous\r\n     institutions. In the clans kinship was always derived through the\r\n     female line. The _Mutterrecht_ everywhere prevailed.{*}\r\n\r\n     {*} [This subject Mr. Morgan treats with a master’s hand in his\r\n     Houses and House Life of the American Aborigines.]\r\n\r\n       μήτηρ μεύ τʹ ἐμέ ψησι Του ἑμμεναι ᾶυτὰρ ἐγωγε\r\n       οὐκ ὀιδ, ὀυ γαρ πώ τις ἐον γόνον ἀυτὸς ἀνέγνω\r\n                       Odyssey, I, 215-6.\r\n\r\n     In that middle stage of barbarism when men began to acquire\r\n     property, when warriors of valor converted to their uses what had\r\n     once been common property,--herds of cattle, wives, etc.,--when\r\n     polygamy became a custom, kinship came to be reckoned through the\r\n     male line. In this way relationship was mightily changed. But in\r\n     aboriginal America where domesticated animals were unknown this\r\n     change did not take place as early as it did elsewhere. In Mexico\r\n     the change did not probably come much before the century of the\r\n     Conquest. Kinship was through females only. The exogamous clan (the\r\n     system which required that the spouse should be taken from another\r\n     clan) was the unit of the social structure, not the family.\r\n\r\n     House life found expression in architecture. One underlying\r\n     principle was everywhere apparent--namely, adaptation to communal\r\n     living. Gradations in culture were evident from the buildings.{*}\r\n     Thus, the “long house” of the Iroquois, from fifty to one hundred\r\n     feet long, divided into compartments every six or eight feet, and\r\n     roughly constructed from timber and bark, betokened very different\r\n     conditions from those which prevailed among the pueblos of the Zuñi\r\n     Indians, with their immense structures of adobe and of stone.\r\n\r\n     {*} [This subject Mr. Morgan treats with a master’s hand in his\r\n     Houses and House Life of the American Aborigines.]\r\n\r\n     In the communal house woman ruled. To her belonged the personal\r\n     property. Because it was derived through her, this property\r\n     remained always with the exogamous clan. Thus, marriage made very\r\n     little difference to woman’s maintenance. If the husband who had\r\n     come into the house proved to be lazy and otherwise worthless,\r\n     divorce was easy, and he was sent back to his own.\r\n\r\n     From its own members the clan elected a sachem to attend to civil\r\n     matters, and a chief to direct its military affairs.\r\n\r\n     The son could not succeed his father in these offices, but a\r\n     brother might succeed a brother. (This was true of the Indian tribe\r\n     to which Powhatan belonged. Had James I of England been aware of\r\n     this fact, he would not have looked with such jealous eyes upon his\r\n     subject Rolfe who had married the Indian princess Pocahontas.) The\r\n     clan was always known by some distinctive name, usually that of\r\n     some animal--beaver, fox, wolf, etc.\r\n\r\n     When the clan became so large as to be unwieldy, it split up into\r\n     phratries. The “phratry” was at first a religious and social\r\n     organization; and one of its chief duties was the prosecution of\r\n     criminals. (The Teutonic hundred was ever ready to exact\r\n     “wehrgeld.”) “The tribe” was usually the highest attainment in\r\n     organization of which the aborigines of America were capable. The\r\n     Mexican confederacy was the most interesting and important of their\r\n     permanent organizations. The Spaniards did not understand the\r\n     principles on which this confederacy was founded, because it was\r\n     entirely unlike anything with which they were familiar.--M.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II\r\n\r\n     SUCCESSION TO THE CROWN--AZTEC NOBILITY--JUDICIAL SYSTEM--LAWS AND\r\n     REVENUES--MILITARY INSTITUTIONS\r\n\r\n\r\nThe form of government differed in the different states of Anahuac. With\r\nthe Aztecs and Tezcucans it was monarchical and nearly absolute. The two\r\nnations resembled each other so much in their political institutions\r\nthat one of their historians has remarked, in too unqualified a manner\r\nindeed, that what is told of one may be always understood as applying to\r\nthe other.[41] I shall direct my inquiries to the Mexican polity,\r\nborrowing an illustration occasionally from that of the rival\r\nkingdom.[42]\r\n\r\nThe government was an elective monarchy. Four of the principal nobles,\r\nwho had been chosen by their own body in the preceding reign, filled\r\nthe office of electors, to whom were added, with merely an honorary\r\nrank, however, the two royal allies of Tezcuco and Tlacopan. The\r\nsovereign was selected from the brothers of the deceased prince, or, in\r\ndefault of them, from his nephews. Thus the election was always\r\nrestricted to the same family. The candidate preferred must have\r\ndistinguished himself in war, though, as in the case of the last\r\nMontezuma, he were a member of the priesthood.[43] This singular mode of\r\nsupplying the throne had some advantages. The candidates received an\r\neducation which fitted them for the royal dignity, while the age at\r\nwhich they were chosen not only secured the nation against the evils of\r\nminority, but afforded ample means for estimating their qualifications\r\nfor the office. The result, at all events, was favorable; since the\r\nthrone, as already noticed, was filled by a succession of able princes,\r\nwell qualified to rule over a warlike and ambitious people. The scheme\r\nof election, however defective, argues a more refined and calculating\r\npolicy than was to have been expected from a barbarous nation.[44]\r\n\r\nThe new monarch[45] was installed in his regal dignity with much parade\r\nof religious ceremony, but not until, by a victorious campaign, he had\r\nobtained a sufficient number of captives to grace his triumphal entry\r\ninto the capital and to furnish victims for the dark and bloody rites\r\nwhich stained the Aztec superstition. Amidst this pomp of human\r\nsacrifice he was crowned. The crown, resembling a mitre in its form, and\r\ncuriously ornamented with gold, gems, and feathers, was placed on his\r\nhead by the lord of Tezcuco, the most powerful of his royal allies. The\r\ntitle of _King_, by which the earlier Aztec princes are distinguished by\r\nSpanish writers, is supplanted by that of _Emperor_ in the later reigns,\r\nintimating, perhaps, his superiority over the confederated monarchies of\r\nTlacopan and Tezcuco.[46]\r\n\r\nThe Aztec princes, especially towards the close of the dynasty, lived in\r\na barbaric pomp, truly Oriental. Their spacious palaces[47] were\r\nprovided with halls for the different councils who aided the monarch in\r\nthe transaction of business. The chief of these was a sort of privy\r\ncouncil, composed in part, probably, of the four electors chosen by the\r\nnobles after the accession, whose places, when made vacant by death,\r\nwere immediately supplied as before. It was the business of this body,\r\nso far as can be gathered from the very loose accounts given of it, to\r\nadvise the king, in respect to the government of the provinces, the\r\nadministration of the revenues, and, indeed, on all great matters of\r\npublic interest.[48]\r\n\r\nIn the royal buildings were accommodations, also, for a numerous\r\nbody-guard[49] of the sovereign, made up of the chief nobility. It is\r\nnot easy to determine with precision, in these barbarian governments,\r\nthe limits of the several orders. It is certain there was a distinct\r\nclass of nobles, with large landed possessions, who held the most\r\nimportant offices near the person of the prince, and engrossed the\r\nadministration of the provinces and cities.[50] Many of these could\r\ntrace their descent from the founders of the Aztec monarchy. According\r\nto some writers of authority, there were thirty great _caciques_, who\r\nhad their residence, at least a part of the year, in the capital, and\r\nwho could muster a hundred thousand vassals each on their estates.[51]\r\nWithout relying on such wild statements, it is clear, from the testimony\r\nof the Conquerors, that the country was occupied by numerous powerful\r\nchieftains, who lived like independent princes on their domains. If it\r\nbe true that the kings encouraged, or, indeed, exacted, the residence of\r\nthese nobles in the capital, and required hostages in their absence, it\r\nis evident that their power must have been very formidable.[52]\r\n\r\nTheir estates appear to have been held by various tenures, and to have\r\nbeen subject to different restrictions. Some of them, earned by their\r\nown good swords or received as the recompense of public services, were\r\nheld without any limitation, except that the possessors could not\r\ndispose of them to a plebeian.[53] Others were entailed on the eldest\r\nmale issue, and, in default of such, reverted to the crown. Most of them\r\nseem to have been burdened with the obligation of military service. The\r\nprincipal chiefs of Tezcuco, according to its chronicler, were expressly\r\nobliged to support their prince with their armed vassals, to attend his\r\ncourt, and aid him in the council. Some, instead of these services, were\r\nto provide for the repairs of his buildings, and to keep the royal\r\ndemesnes in order, with an annual offering, by way of homage, of fruits\r\nand flowers. It was usual, if we are to believe historians, for a new\r\nking, on his accession, to confirm the investiture of estates derived\r\nfrom the crown.[54]\r\n\r\nIt cannot be denied that we recognize, in all this, several features of\r\nthe feudal system,[55] which, no doubt, lose nothing of their effect\r\nunder the hands of the Spanish writers, who are fond of tracing\r\nanalogies to European institutions. But such analogies lead sometimes to\r\nvery erroneous conclusions. The obligation of military service, for\r\ninstance, the most essential principle of a fief, seems to be naturally\r\ndemanded by every government from its subjects. As to minor points of\r\nresemblance, they fall far short of that harmonious system of reciprocal\r\nservice and protection which embraced, in nice gradation, every order of\r\na feudal monarchy. The kingdoms of Anahuac were in their nature\r\ndespotic, attended, indeed, with many mitigating circumstances unknown\r\nto the despotisms of the East; but it is chimerical to look for much in\r\ncommon--beyond a few accidental forms and ceremonies--with those\r\naristocratic institutions of the Middle Ages which made the court of\r\nevery petty baron the precise image in miniature of that of his\r\nsovereign.\r\n\r\nThe legislative power, both in Mexico and Tezcuco, resided wholly with\r\nthe monarch.[56] This feature of despotism, however, was in some measure\r\ncounteracted by the constitution of the judicial tribunals,--of more\r\nimportance, among a rude people, than the legislative, since it is\r\neasier to make good laws for such a community than to enforce them, and\r\nthe best laws, badly administered, are but a mockery. Over each of the\r\nprincipal cities, with its dependent territories, was placed a supreme\r\njudge, appointed by the crown, with original and final jurisdiction in\r\nboth civil and criminal cases. There was no appeal from his sentence to\r\nany other tribunal, nor even to the king. He held his office during\r\nlife; and any one who usurped his ensigns was punished with death.[57]\r\n\r\nBelow this magistrate was a court, established in each province, and\r\nconsisting of three members. It held concurrent jurisdiction with the\r\nsupreme judge in civil suits, but in criminal an appeal lay to his\r\ntribunal. Besides these courts, there was a body of inferior\r\nmagistrates, distributed through the country, chosen by the people\r\nthemselves in their several districts. Their authority was limited to\r\nsmaller causes, while the more important were carried up to the higher\r\ncourts. There was still another class of subordinate officers, appointed\r\nalso by the people, each of whom was to watch over the conduct of a\r\ncertain number of families and report any disorder or breach of the laws\r\nto the higher authorities.[58]\r\n\r\nIn Tezcuco the judicial arrangements were of a more refined\r\ncharacter;[59] and a gradation of tribunals finally terminated in a\r\ngeneral meeting or parliament, consisting of all the judges, great and\r\npetty, throughout the kingdom, held every eighty days in the capital,\r\nover which the king presided in person. This body determined all suits\r\nwhich, from their importance or difficulty, had been reserved for its\r\nconsideration by the lower tribunals. It served, moreover, as a council\r\nof state, to assist the monarch in the transaction of public\r\nbusiness.[60]\r\n\r\nSuch are the vague and imperfect notices that can be gleaned, respecting\r\nthe Aztec tribunals, from the hieroglyphical paintings still preserved,\r\nand from the most accredited Spanish writers. These, being usually\r\necclesiastics, have taken much less interest in this subject than in\r\nmatters connected with religion. They find some apology, certainly, in\r\nthe early destruction of most of the Indian paintings, from which their\r\ninformation was, in part, to be gathered.\r\n\r\nOn the whole, however, it must be inferred that the Aztecs were\r\nsufficiently civilized to evince a solicitude for the rights both of\r\nproperty and of persons. The law, authorizing an appeal to the highest\r\njudicature in criminal matters only, shows an attention to personal\r\nsecurity, rendered the more obligatory by the extreme severity of their\r\npenal code, which would naturally have made them more cautious of a\r\nwrong conviction. The existence of a number of co-ordinate tribunals,\r\nwithout a central one of supreme authority to control the whole, must\r\nhave given rise to very discordant interpretations of the law in\r\ndifferent districts. But this is an evil which they shared in common\r\nwith most of the nations of Europe.\r\n\r\nThe provision for making the superior judges wholly independent of the\r\ncrown was worthy of an enlightened people. It presented the strongest\r\nbarrier that a mere constitution could afford against tyranny. It is\r\nnot, indeed, to be supposed that, in a government otherwise so despotic,\r\nmeans could not be found for influencing the magistrate. But it was a\r\ngreat step to fence round his authority with the sanction of the law;\r\nand no one of the Aztec monarchs, so far as I know, is accused of an\r\nattempt to violate it.\r\n\r\nTo receive presents or a bribe, to be guilty of collusion in any way\r\nwith a suitor, was punished, in a judge, with death. Who, or what\r\ntribunal, decided as to his guilt, does not appear. In Tezcuco this was\r\ndone by the rest of the court. But the king presided over that body. The\r\nTezcucan prince Nezahualpilli, who rarely tempered justice with mercy,\r\nput one judge to death for taking a bribe, and another for determining\r\nsuits in his own house,--a capital offence, also, by law.[61]\r\n\r\nThe judges of the higher tribunals were maintained from the produce of a\r\npart of the crown lands, reserved for this purpose. They, as well as the\r\nsupreme judge, held their offices for life. The proceedings in the\r\ncourts were conducted with decency and order. The judges wore an\r\nappropriate dress, and attended to business both parts of the day,\r\ndining always, for the sake of despatch, in an apartment of the same\r\nbuilding where they held their session; a method of proceeding much\r\ncommended by the Spanish chroniclers, to whom despatch was not very\r\nfamiliar in their own tribunals. Officers attended to preserve order,\r\nand others summoned the parties and produced them in court. No counsel\r\nwas employed; the parties stated their own case and supported it by\r\ntheir witnesses. The oath of the accused was also admitted in\r\nevidence.[62] The statement of the case, the testimony, and the\r\nproceedings of the trial were all set forth by a clerk, in\r\nhieroglyphical paintings, and handed over to the court. The paintings\r\nwere executed with so much accuracy that in all suits respecting real\r\nproperty they were allowed to be produced as good authority in the\r\nSpanish tribunals, very long after the Conquest; and a chair for their\r\nstudy and interpretation was established at Mexico in 1553, which has\r\nlong since shared the fate of most other provisions for learning in that\r\nunfortunate country.[63]\r\n\r\nA capital sentence was indicated by a line traced with an arrow across\r\nthe portrait of the accused. In Tezcuco, where the king presided in the\r\ncourt, this, according to the national chronicler, was done with\r\nextraordinary parade. His description, which is of rather a poetical\r\ncast, I give in his own words. “In the royal palace of Tezcuco was a\r\ncourt-yard, on the opposite sides of which were two halls of justice. In\r\nthe principal one, called the ‘tribunal of God,’ was a throne of pure\r\ngold, inlaid with turquoises and other precious stones. On a stool in\r\nfront was placed a human skull, crowned with an immense emerald of a\r\npyramidal form, and surmounted by an aigrette of brilliant plumes and\r\nprecious stones. The skull was laid on a heap of military weapons,\r\nshields, quivers, bows, and arrows. The walls were hung with tapestry,\r\nmade of the hair of different wild animals, of rich and various colors,\r\nfestooned by gold rings and embroidered with figures of birds and\r\nflowers. Above the throne was a canopy of variegated plumage, from the\r\ncentre of which shot forth resplendent rays of gold and jewels. The\r\nother tribunal, called ‘the King’s,’ was also surmounted by a gorgeous\r\ncanopy of feathers, on which were emblazoned the royal arms. Here the\r\nsovereign gave public audience and communicated his despatches. But when\r\nhe decided important causes, or confirmed a capital sentence, he passed\r\nto the ‘tribunal of God,’ attended by the fourteen great lords of the\r\nrealm, marshalled according to their rank. Then, putting on his mitred\r\ncrown, incrusted with precious stones, and holding a golden arrow, by\r\nway of sceptre, in his left hand, he laid his right upon the skull, and\r\npronounced judgment.”[64] All this looks rather fine for a court of\r\njustice, it must be owned. But it is certain that the Tezcucans, as we\r\nshall see hereafter, possessed both the materials and the skill\r\nrequisite to work them up in this manner. Had they been a little further\r\nadvanced in refinement, one might well doubt their having the bad taste\r\nto do so.\r\n\r\nThe laws of the Aztecs were registered, and exhibited to the people, in\r\ntheir hieroglyphical paintings. Much the larger part of them, as in\r\nevery nation imperfectly civilized, relates rather to the security of\r\npersons than of property.[65] The great crimes against society were all\r\nmade capital. Even the murder of a slave was punished with death.\r\nAdulterers, as among the Jews, were stoned to death. Thieving, according\r\nto the degree of the offence, was punished by slavery or death. Yet the\r\nMexicans could have been under no great apprehension of this crime,\r\nsince the entrances to their dwellings were not secured by bolts or\r\nfastenings of any kind. It was a capital offence to remove the\r\nboundaries of another’s lands; to alter the established measures; and\r\nfor a guardian not to be able to give a good account of his ward’s\r\nproperty. These regulations evince a regard for equity in dealings, and\r\nfor private rights, which argues a considerable progress in\r\ncivilization. Prodigals, who squandered their patrimony, were punished\r\nin like manner; a severe sentence, since the crime brought its adequate\r\npunishment along with it. Intemperance, which was the burden, moreover,\r\nof their religious homilies, was visited with the severest penalties; as\r\nif they had foreseen in it the consuming canker of their own as well as\r\nof the other Indian races in later times. It was punished in the young\r\nwith death, and in older persons with loss of rank and confiscation of\r\nproperty. Yet a decent conviviality was not meant to be proscribed at\r\ntheir festivals, and they possessed the means of indulging it, in a mild\r\nfermented liquor, called _pulque_, which is still popular, not only with\r\nthe Indian, but the European population of the country.[66]\r\n\r\nThe rites of marriage were celebrated with as much formality as in any\r\nChristian country; and the institution was held in such reverence that a\r\ntribunal was instituted for the sole purpose of determining questions\r\nrelating to it. Divorces could not be obtained until authorized by a\r\nsentence of this court, after a patient hearing of the parties.\r\n\r\nBut the most remarkable part of the Aztec code was that relating to\r\nslavery. There were several descriptions of slaves: prisoners taken in\r\nwar, who were almost always reserved for the dreadful doom of sacrifice;\r\ncriminals, public debtors, persons who, from extreme poverty,\r\nvoluntarily resigned their freedom, and children who were sold by their\r\nown parents. In the last instance, usually occasioned also by poverty,\r\nit was common for the parents, with the master’s consent, to substitute\r\nothers of their children successively, as they grew up; thus\r\ndistributing the burden as equally as possible among the different\r\nmembers of the family. The willingness of freemen to incur the penalties\r\nof this condition is explained by the mild form in which it existed. The\r\ncontract of sale was executed in the presence of at least four\r\nwitnesses. The services to be exacted were limited with great\r\nprecision. The slave was allowed to have his own family, to hold\r\nproperty, and even other slaves. His children were free. No one could be\r\nborn to slavery in Mexico;[67] an honorable distinction, not known, I\r\nbelieve, in any civilized community where slavery has been\r\nsanctioned.[68] Slaves were not sold by their masters, unless when these\r\nwere driven to it by poverty. They were often liberated by them at their\r\ndeath, and sometimes, as there was no natural repugnance founded on\r\ndifference of blood and race, were married to them. Yet a refractory or\r\nvicious slave might be led into the market, with a collar round his\r\nneck,[69] which intimated his bad character, and there be publicly sold,\r\nand, on a second sale, reserved for sacrifice.[70]\r\n\r\nSuch are some of the most striking features of the Aztec code, to which\r\nthe Tezcucan bore great resemblance.[71] With some exceptions, it is\r\nstamped with the severity, the ferocity indeed, of a rude people,\r\nhardened by familiarity with scenes of blood, and relying on physical\r\ninstead of moral means for the correction of evil.[72] Still, it evinces\r\na profound respect for the great principles of morality, and as clear a\r\nperception of these principles as is to be found in the most cultivated\r\nnations.\r\n\r\nThe royal revenues were derived from various sources. The crown\r\nlands,[73] which appear to have been extensive, made their returns in\r\nkind. The places in the neighborhood of the capital were bound to supply\r\nworkmen and materials for building the king’s palaces and keeping them\r\nin repair. They were also to furnish fuel, provisions, and whatever was\r\nnecessary for his ordinary domestic expenditure, which was certainly on\r\nno stinted scale.[74] The principal cities, which had numerous villages\r\nand a large territory dependent on them, were distributed into\r\ndistricts, with each a share of the lands allotted to it, for its\r\nsupport. The inhabitants paid a stipulated part of the produce to the\r\ncrown. The vassals of the great chiefs, also, paid a portion of their\r\nearnings into the public treasury; an arrangement not at all in the\r\nspirit of the feudal institutions.[75]\r\n\r\nIn addition to this tax on all the agricultural produce of the kingdom,\r\nthere was another on its manufactures. The nature and the variety of the\r\ntributes will be best shown by an enumeration of some of the principal\r\narticles. These were cotton dresses, and mantles of feather-work\r\nexquisitely made; ornamented armor; vases and plates of gold; gold dust,\r\nbands and bracelets; crystal, gilt, and varnished jars and goblets;\r\nbells, arms, and utensils of copper; reams of paper; grain, fruits,\r\ncopal, amber, cochineal, cacao, wild animals and birds, timber, lime,\r\nmats, etc.[76] In this curious medley of the most homely commodities\r\nand the elegant superfluities of luxury, it is singular that no mention\r\nshould be made of silver, the great staple of the country in later\r\ntimes, and the use of which was certainly known to the Aztecs.[77]\r\n\r\nGarrisons were established in the larger cities,--probably those at a\r\ndistance and recently conquered,--to keep down revolt, and to enforce\r\nthe payment of the tribute.[78][79] Tax-gatherers were also distributed\r\nthroughout the kingdom, who were recognized by their official badges,\r\nand dreaded from the merciless rigor of their exactions. By a stern law,\r\nevery defaulter was liable to be taken and sold as a slave. In the\r\ncapital were spacious granaries and warehouses for the reception of the\r\ntributes. A receiver-general was quartered in the palace, who rendered\r\nin an exact account of the various contributions, and watched over the\r\nconduct of the inferior agents, in whom the least malversation was\r\nsummarily punished. This functionary was furnished with a map of the\r\nwhole empire, with a minute specification of the imposts assessed on\r\nevery part of it. These imposts, moderate under the reigns of the early\r\nprinces, became so burdensome under those at the close of the dynasty,\r\nbeing rendered still more oppressive by the manner of collection, that\r\nthey bred disaffection throughout the land, and prepared the way for its\r\nconquest by the Spaniards.[80]\r\n\r\nCommunication was maintained with the remotest parts of the country by\r\nmeans of couriers. Post-houses were established on the great roads,\r\nabout two leagues distant from each other. The courier, bearing his\r\ndespatches in the form of a hieroglyphical painting, ran with them to\r\nthe first station, where they were taken by another messenger and\r\ncarried forward to the next, and so on till they reached the capital.\r\nThese couriers, trained from childhood, travelled with incredible\r\nswiftness,--not four or five leagues an hour, as an old chronicler would\r\nmake us believe, but with such speed that despatches were carried from\r\none to two hundred miles a day.[81] Fresh fish was frequently served at\r\nMontezuma’s table in twenty-four hours from the time it had been taken\r\nin the Gulf of Mexico, two hundred miles from the capital. In this way\r\nintelligence of the movements of the royal armies was rapidly brought\r\nto court; and the dress of the courier, denoting by its color the\r\nnature of his tidings, spread joy or consternation in the towns through\r\nwhich he passed.[82]\r\n\r\nBut the great aim of the Aztec institutions, to which private discipline\r\nand public honors were alike directed, was the profession of arms. In\r\nMexico, as in Egypt, the soldier shared with the priest the highest\r\nconsideration. The king, as we have seen, must be an experienced\r\nwarrior. The tutelary deity of the Aztecs was the god of war. A great\r\nobject of their military expeditions was to gather hecatombs of captives\r\nfor his altars. The soldier who fell in battle was transported at once\r\nto the region of ineffable bliss in the bright mansions of the Sun.[83]\r\nEvery war, therefore, became a crusade; and the warrior, animated by a\r\nreligious enthusiasm like that of the early Saracen or the Christian\r\ncrusader, was not only raised to a contempt of danger, but courted it,\r\nfor the imperishable crown of martyrdom. Thus we find the same impulse\r\nacting in the most opposite quarters of the globe, and the Asiatic, the\r\nEuropean, and the American, each earnestly invoking the holy name of\r\nreligion in the perpetration of human butchery.\r\n\r\nThe question of war was discussed in a council of the king and his chief\r\nnobles.[84] Ambassadors were sent, previously to its declaration, to\r\nrequire the hostile state to receive the Mexican gods and to pay the\r\ncustomary tribute. The persons of ambassadors were held sacred\r\nthroughout Anahuac. They were lodged and entertained in the great towns\r\nat the public charge, and were everywhere received with courtesy, so\r\nlong as they did not deviate from the high-roads on their route. When\r\nthey did, they forfeited their privileges. If the embassy proved\r\nunsuccessful, a defiance, or open declaration of war, was sent; quotas\r\nwere drawn from the conquered provinces, which were always subjected to\r\nmilitary service, as well as the payment of taxes; and the royal army,\r\nusually with the monarch at its head, began its march.[85]\r\n\r\nThe Aztec princes made use of the incentives employed by European\r\nmonarchs to excite the ambition of their followers. They established\r\nvarious military orders, each having its privileges and peculiar\r\ninsignia. There seems, also, to have existed a sort of knighthood of\r\ninferior degree.[86] It was the cheapest reward of martial prowess, and\r\nwhoever had not reached it was excluded from using ornaments on his arms\r\nor his person, and obliged to wear a coarse white stuff, made from the\r\nthreads of the aloe, called _nequen_. Even the members of the royal\r\nfamily were not excepted from this law, which reminds one of the\r\noccasional practice of Christian knights, to wear plain armor, or\r\nshields without device, till they had achieved some doughty feat of\r\nchivalry. Although the military orders were thrown open to all, it is\r\nprobable that they were chiefly filled with persons of rank, who, by\r\ntheir previous training and connections, were able to come into the\r\nfield under peculiar advantages.[87]\r\n\r\nThe dress of the higher warriors was picturesque and often magnificent.\r\nTheir bodies were covered with a close vest of quilted cotton, so thick\r\nas to be impenetrable to the light missiles of Indian warfare. This\r\ngarment was so light and serviceable that it was adopted by the\r\nSpaniards. The wealthier chiefs sometimes wore, instead of this cotton\r\nmail, a cuirass made of thin plates of gold or silver. Over it was\r\nthrown a surcoat of the gorgeous feather-work in which they\r\nexcelled.[88] Their helmets were sometimes of wood, fashioned like the\r\nheads of wild animals, and sometimes of silver, on the top of which\r\nwaved a _panache_ of variegated plumes, sprinkled with precious stones\r\nand ornaments of gold. They wore also collars, bracelets, and ear-rings\r\nof the same rich materials.[89]\r\n\r\nTheir armies were divided into bodies of eight thousand men; and these,\r\nagain, into companies of three or four hundred, each with its own\r\ncommander. The national standard, which has been compared to the ancient\r\nRoman, displayed, in its embroidery of gold and feather-work, the\r\narmorial ensigns of the state. These were significant of its name,\r\nwhich, as the names of both persons and places were borrowed from some\r\nmaterial object, was easily expressed by hieroglyphical symbols. The\r\ncompanies and the great chiefs had also their appropriate banners and\r\ndevices, and the gaudy hues of their many-colored plumes gave a dazzling\r\nsplendor to the spectacle.\r\n\r\nTheir tactics were such as belong to a nation with whom war, though a\r\ntrade, is not elevated to the rank of a science. They advanced singing,\r\nand shouting their war-cries, briskly charging the enemy, as rapidly\r\nretreating, and making use of ambuscades, sudden surprises, and the\r\nlight skirmish of guerilla warfare. Yet their discipline was such as to\r\ndraw forth the encomiums of the Spanish conquerors. “A beautiful sight\r\nit was,” says one of them, “to see them set out on their march, all\r\nmoving forward so gayly, and in so admirable order!”[90] In battle they\r\ndid not seek to kill their enemies, so much as to take them\r\nprisoners;[91] and they never scalped, like other North American tribes.\r\nThe valor of a warrior was estimated by the number of his prisoners; and\r\nno ransom was large enough to save the devoted captive.[92]\r\n\r\nTheir military code bore the same stern features as their other laws.\r\nDisobedience of orders was punished with death. It was death, also, for\r\na soldier to leave his colors, to attack the enemy before the signal was\r\ngiven, or to plunder another’s booty or prisoners. One of the last\r\nTezcucan princes, in the spirit of an ancient Roman, put two sons to\r\ndeath--after having cured their wounds--for violating the last-mentioned\r\nlaw.[93]\r\n\r\nI must not omit to notice here an institution the introduction of which\r\nin the Old World is ranked among the beneficent fruits of Christianity.\r\nHospitals were established in the principal cities, for the cure of the\r\nsick and the permanent refuge of the disabled soldier;[94] and surgeons\r\nwere placed over them, “who were so far better than those in Europe,”\r\nsays an old chronicler, “that they did not protract the cure in order to\r\nincrease the pay.”[95]\r\n\r\nSuch is the brief outline of the civil and military polity of the\r\nancient Mexicans; less perfect than could be desired in regard to the\r\nformer, from the imperfection of the sources whence it is drawn. Whoever\r\nhas had occasion to explore the early history of modern Europe has found\r\nhow vague and unsatisfactory is the political information which can be\r\ngleaned from the gossip of monkish annalists. How much is the difficulty\r\nincreased in the present instance, where this information, first\r\nrecorded in the dubious language of hieroglyphics, was interpreted in\r\nanother language, with which the Spanish chroniclers were imperfectly\r\nacquainted, while it related to institutions of which their past\r\nexperience enabled them to form no adequate conception! Amidst such\r\nuncertain lights, it is in vain to expect nice accuracy of detail. All\r\nthat can be done is to attempt an outline of the more prominent\r\nfeatures, that a correct impression, so far as it goes, may be produced\r\non the mind of the reader.\r\n\r\nEnough has been said, however, to show that the Aztec and Tezcucan races\r\nwere advanced in civilization very far beyond the wandering tribes of\r\nNorth America.[96] The degree of civilization which they had reached, as\r\ninferred by their political institutions, may be considered, perhaps,\r\nnot much short of that enjoyed by our Saxon ancestors under Alfred. In\r\nrespect to the nature of it, they may be better compared with the\r\nEgyptians; and the examination of their social relations and culture may\r\nsuggest still stronger points of resemblance to that ancient people.\r\n\r\nThose familiar with the modern Mexicans will find it difficult to\r\nconceive that the nation should ever have been capable of devising the\r\nenlightened polity which we have been considering. But they should\r\nremember that in the Mexicans of our day they see only a conquered\r\nrace; as different from their ancestors as are the modern Egyptians from\r\nthose who built,--I will not say, the tasteless pyramids,--but the\r\ntemples and palaces whose magnificent wrecks strew the borders of the\r\nNile, at Luxor and Karnac. The difference is not so great as between the\r\nancient Greek, and his degenerate descendant, lounging among the\r\nmasterpieces of art which he has scarcely taste enough to\r\nadmire,--speaking the language of those still more imperishable\r\nmonuments of literature which he has hardly capacity to comprehend. Yet\r\nhe breathes the same atmosphere, is warmed by the same sun, nourished by\r\nthe same scenes, as those who fell at Marathon and won the trophies of\r\nOlympic Pisa. The same blood flows in his veins that flowed in theirs.\r\nBut ages of tyranny have passed over him; he belongs to a conquered\r\nrace.\r\n\r\nThe American Indian has something peculiarly sensitive in his nature. He\r\nshrinks instinctively from the rude touch of a foreign hand. Even when\r\nthis foreign influence comes in the form of civilization, he seems to\r\nsink and pine away beneath it. It has been so with the Mexicans. Under\r\nthe Spanish domination, their numbers have silently melted away. Their\r\nenergies are broken. They no longer tread their mountain plains with the\r\nconscious independence of their ancestors. In their faltering step and\r\nmeek and melancholy aspect we read the sad characters of the conquered\r\nrace. The cause of humanity, indeed, has gained. They live under a\r\nbetter system of laws, a more assured tranquillity, a purer faith. But\r\nall does not avail. Their civilization was of the hardy character which\r\nbelongs to the wilderness. The fierce virtues of the Aztec were all his\r\nown. They refused to submit to European culture,--to be engrafted on a\r\nforeign stock. His outward form, his complexion, his lineaments, are\r\nsubstantially the same; but the moral characteristics of the nation, all\r\nthat constituted its individuality as a race, are effaced forever.\r\n\r\n     Two of the principal authorities for this chapter are Torquemada\r\n     and Clavigero. The former, a Provincial of the Franciscan order,\r\n     came to the New World about the middle of the sixteenth century. As\r\n     the generation of the Conquerors had not then passed away, he had\r\n     ample opportunities of gathering the particulars of their\r\n     enterprise from their own lips. Fifty years, during which he\r\n     continued in the country, put him in possession of the traditions\r\n     and usages of the natives, and enabled him to collect their history\r\n     from the earliest missionaries, as well as from such monuments as\r\n     the fanaticism of his own countrymen had not then destroyed. From\r\n     these ample sources he compiled his bulky tomes, beginning, after\r\n     the approved fashion of the ancient Castilian chroniclers, with the\r\n     creation of the world, and embracing the whole circle of the\r\n     Mexican institutions, political, religious, and social, from the\r\n     earliest period to his own time. In handling these fruitful themes,\r\n     the worthy father has shown a full measure of the bigotry which\r\n     belonged to his order at that period. Every page, too, is loaded\r\n     with illustrations from Scripture or profane history, which form a\r\n     whimsical contrast to the barbaric staple of his story; and he has\r\n     sometimes fallen into serious errors, from his misconception of the\r\n     chronological system of the Aztecs. But, notwithstanding these\r\n     glaring defects in the composition of the work, the student, aware\r\n     of his author’s infirmities, will find few better guides than\r\n     Torquemada in tracing the stream of historic truth up to the\r\n     fountain-head; such is his manifest integrity, and so great were\r\n     his facilities for information on the most curious points of\r\n     Mexican antiquity. No work, accordingly, has been more largely\r\n     consulted and copied, even by some who, like Herrera, have affected\r\n     to set little value on the sources whence its information was\r\n     drawn. (Hist. general, dec. 6, lib. 6, cap. 19.) The _Monarchía\r\n     Indiana_ was first published at Seville, 1615 (Nic. Antonio,\r\n     Bibliotheca Nova (Matriti, 1783), tom. ii. p. 787), and since, in a\r\n     better style, in three volumes folio, at Madrid, in 1723.\r\n\r\n     The other authority, frequently cited in the preceding pages, is\r\n     the Abbé Clavigero’s _Storia antica del Messico_. It was originally\r\n     printed towards the close of the last century, in the Italian\r\n     language, and in Italy, whither the author, a native of Vera Cruz,\r\n     and a member of the order of the Jesuits, had retired, on the\r\n     expulsion of that body from Spanish America, in 1767. During a\r\n     residence of thirty-five years in his own country, Clavigero had\r\n     made himself intimately acquainted with its antiquities, by the\r\n     careful examination of paintings, manuscripts, and such other\r\n     remains as were to be found in his day. The plan of his work is\r\n     nearly as comprehensive as that of his predecessor, Torquemada; but\r\n     the later and more cultivated period in which he wrote is visible\r\n     in the superior address with which he has managed his complicated\r\n     subject. In the elaborate disquisitions in his concluding volume,\r\n     he has done much to rectify the chronology and the various\r\n     inaccuracies of preceding writers. Indeed, an avowed object of his\r\n     work was to vindicate his countrymen from what he conceived to be\r\n     the misrepresentations of Robertson, Raynal, and De Pau. In regard\r\n     to the last two he was perfectly successful. Such an ostensible\r\n     design might naturally suggest unfavorable ideas of his\r\n     impartiality. But, on the whole, he seems to have conducted the\r\n     discussion with good faith; and, if he has been led by national\r\n     zeal to overcharge the picture with brilliant colors, he will be\r\n     found much more temperate, in this respect, than those who preceded\r\n     him, while he has applied sound principles of criticism, of which\r\n     they were incapable. In a word, the diligence of his researches has\r\n     gathered into one focus the scattered lights of tradition and\r\n     antiquarian lore, purified in a great measure from the mists of\r\n     superstition which obscure the best productions of an earlier\r\n     period. From these causes, the work, notwithstanding its occasional\r\n     prolixity, and the disagreeable aspect given to it by the profusion\r\n     of uncouth names in the Mexican orthography, which bristle over\r\n     every page, has found merited favor with the public, and created\r\n     something like a popular interest in the subject. Soon after its\r\n     publication at Cesena, in 1780, it was translated into English, and\r\n     more lately into Spanish and German.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III\r\n\r\nMEXICAN MYTHOLOGY--THE SACERDOTAL ORDER--THE TEMPLES--HUMAN SACRIFICES\r\n\r\n\r\nThe civil polity of the Aztecs is so closely blended with their religion\r\nthat without understanding the latter it is impossible to form correct\r\nideas of their government or their social institutions. I shall pass\r\nover, for the present, some remarkable traditions, bearing a singular\r\nresemblance to those found in the Scriptures, and endeavor to give a\r\nbrief sketch of their mythology and their careful provisions for\r\nmaintaining a national worship.\r\n\r\nMythology may be regarded as the poetry of religion, or rather as the\r\npoetic development of the religious principle in a primitive age. It is\r\nthe effort of untutored man to explain the mysteries of existence, and\r\nthe secret agencies by which the operations of nature are conducted.\r\nAlthough the growth of similar conditions of society, its character must\r\nvary with that of the rude tribes in which it originates; and the\r\nferocious Goth, quaffing mead from the skulls of his slaughtered\r\nenemies, must have a very different mythology from that of the\r\neffeminate native of Hispaniola, loitering away his hours in idle\r\npastimes, under the shadow of his bananas.\r\n\r\nAt a later and more refined period, we sometimes find these primitive\r\nlegends combined into a regular system under the hands of the poet, and\r\nthe rude outline moulded into forms of ideal beauty, which are the\r\nobjects of adoration in a credulous age, and the delight of all\r\nsucceeding ones. Such were the beautiful inventions of Hesiod and Homer,\r\n“who,” says the Father of History, “created the theogony of the Greeks;”\r\nan assertion not to be taken too literally, since it is hardly possible\r\nthat any man should create a religious system for his nation.[97] They\r\nonly filled up the shadowy outlines of tradition with the bright touches\r\nof their own imaginations, until they had clothed them in beauty which\r\nkindled the imaginations of others. The power of the poet, indeed, may\r\nbe felt in a similar way in a much riper period of society. To say\r\nnothing of the “Divina Commedia,” who is there that rises from the\r\nperusal of “Paradise Lost” without feeling his own conceptions of the\r\nangelic hierarchy quickened by those of the inspired artist, and a new\r\nand sensible form, as it were, given to images which had before floated\r\ndim and undefined before him?\r\n\r\nThe last-mentioned period is succeeded by that of philosophy; which,\r\ndisclaiming alike the legends of the primitive age and the poetical\r\nembellishments of the succeeding one, seeks to shelter itself from the\r\ncharge of impiety by giving an allegorical interpretation to the popular\r\nmythology, and thus to reconcile the latter with the genuine deductions\r\nof science.\r\n\r\nThe Mexican religion had emerged from the first of the schools we have\r\nbeen considering, and, although little affected by poetical influences,\r\nhad received a peculiar complexion from the priests, who had digested as\r\nthorough and burdensome a ceremonial as ever existed in any nation. They\r\nhad, moreover, thrown the veil of allegory over early tradition, and\r\ninvested their deities with attributes savoring much more of the\r\ngrotesque conceptions of the Eastern nations in the Old World, than of\r\nthe lighter fictions of Greek mythology, in which the features of\r\nhumanity, however exaggerated, were never wholly abandoned.[98]\r\n\r\nIn contemplating the religious system of the Aztecs, one is struck with\r\nits apparent incongruity, as if some portion of it had emanated from a\r\ncomparatively refined people, open to gentle influences, while the rest\r\nbreathes a spirit of unmitigated ferocity. It naturally suggests the\r\nidea of two distinct sources, and authorizes the belief that the Aztecs\r\nhad inherited from their predecessors a milder faith, on which was\r\nafterwards engrafted their own mythology. The latter soon became\r\ndominant, and gave its dark coloring to the creeds of the conquered\r\nnations,--which the Mexicans, like the ancient Romans, seem willingly to\r\nhave incorporated into their own,--until the same funereal superstition\r\nsettled over the farthest borders of Anahuac.\r\n\r\nThe Aztecs recognized the existence of a supreme Creator and Lord of the\r\nuniverse. They addressed him, in their prayers, as “the God by whom we\r\nlive,” “omnipresent, that knoweth all thoughts, and giveth all gifts,”\r\n“without whom man is as nothing,” “invisible, incorporeal, one God, of\r\n_perfect perfection_ and purity,” “under whose wings we find repose and\r\na sure defence.” These sublime attributes infer no inadequate conception\r\nof the true God. But the idea of unity--of a being with whom volition is\r\naction, who has no need of inferior ministers to execute his\r\npurposes--was too simple, or too vast, for their understandings; and\r\nthey sought relief, as usual, in a plurality of deities, who presided\r\nover the elements, the changes of the seasons, and the various\r\noccupations of man.[99] Of these, there were thirteen principal deities,\r\nand more than two hundred inferior; to each of whom some special day or\r\nappropriate festival was consecrated.[100]\r\n\r\nAt the head of all stood the terrible Huitzilopochtli, the Mexican Mars;\r\nalthough it is doing injustice to the heroic war-god of antiquity to\r\nidentify him with this sanguinary monster. This was the patron deity of\r\nthe nation. His fantastic image was loaded with costly ornaments. His\r\ntemples were the most stately and august of the public edifices; and his\r\naltars reeked with the blood of human hecatombs in every city of the\r\nempire. Disastrous indeed must have been the influence of such a\r\nsuperstition on the character of the people.[101]\r\n\r\nA far more interesting personage in their mythology was Quetzalcoatl,\r\ngod of the air, a divinity who, during his residence on earth,\r\ninstructed the natives in the use of metals, in agriculture, and in the\r\narts of government. He was one of those benefactors of their species,\r\ndoubtless, who have been deified by the gratitude of posterity. Under\r\nhim, the earth teemed with fruits and flowers, without the pains of\r\nculture. An ear of Indian corn was as much as a single man could carry.\r\nThe cotton, as it grew, took, of its own accord, the rich dyes of human\r\nart. The air was filled with intoxicating perfumes and the sweet melody\r\nof birds. In short, these were the halcyon days, which find a place in\r\nthe mythic systems of so many nations in the Old World. It was the\r\n_golden age_ of Anahuac.[102]\r\n\r\nFrom some cause, not explained, Quetzalcoatl incurred the wrath of one\r\nof the principal gods, and was compelled to abandon the country. On his\r\nway he stopped at the city of Cholula, where a temple was dedicated to\r\nhis worship, the massy ruins of which still form one of the interesting\r\nrelics of antiquity in Mexico. When he reached the shores of the Mexican\r\nGulf, he took leave of his followers, promising that he and his\r\ndescendants would revisit them hereafter, and then, entering his wizard\r\nskiff, made of serpents’ skins, embarked on the great ocean for the\r\nfabled land of Tlapallan. He was said to have been tall in stature, with\r\na white skin, long, dark hair, and a flowing beard. The Mexicans looked\r\nconfidently to the return of the benevolent deity; and this remarkable\r\ntradition, deeply cherished in their hearts, prepared the way, as we\r\nshall see hereafter, for the future success of the Spaniards.[103]\r\n\r\nWe have not space for further details respecting the Mexican divinities,\r\nthe attributes of many of whom were carefully defined, as they\r\ndescended, in regular gradation, to the _penates_ or household gods,\r\nwhose little images were to be found in the humblest dwelling.\r\n\r\nThe Aztecs felt the curiosity, common to man in almost every stage of\r\ncivilization, to lift the veil which covers the mysterious past and the\r\nmore awful future. They sought relief, like the nations of the Old\r\nContinent, from the oppressive idea of eternity, by breaking it up into\r\ndistinct cycles, or periods of time, each of several thousand years’\r\nduration. There were four of these cycles, and at the end of each, by\r\nthe agency of one of the elements, the human family was swept from the\r\nearth, and the sun blotted out from the heavens, to be again\r\nrekindled.[104]\r\n\r\nThey imagined three separate states of existence in the future life. The\r\nwicked, comprehending the greater part of mankind, were to expiate their\r\nsins in a place of everlasting darkness. Another class, with no other\r\nmerit than that of having died of certain diseases, capriciously\r\nselected, were to enjoy a negative existence of indolent contentment.\r\nThe highest place was reserved, as in most warlike nations, for the\r\nheroes who fell in battle, or in sacrifice. They passed at once into the\r\npresence of the Sun, whom they accompanied with songs and choral dances\r\nin his bright progress through the heavens; and, after some years, their\r\nspirits went to animate the clouds and singing-birds of beautiful\r\nplumage, and to revel amidst the rich blossoms and odors of the gardens\r\nof paradise.[105] Such was the heaven of the Aztecs; more refined in its\r\ncharacter than that of the more polished pagan, whose elysium reflected\r\nonly the martial sports or sensual gratifications of this life.[106] In\r\nthe destiny they assigned to the wicked, we discern similar traces of\r\nrefinement; since the absence of all physical torture forms a striking\r\ncontrast to the schemes of suffering so ingeniously devised by the\r\nfancies of the most enlightened nations.[107] In all this, so contrary\r\nto the natural suggestions of the ferocious Aztec, we see the evidences\r\nof a higher civilization,[108] inherited from their predecessors in the\r\nland.\r\n\r\nOur limits will allow only a brief allusion to one or two of their most\r\ninteresting ceremonies. On the death of a person, his corpse was dressed\r\nin the peculiar habiliments of his tutelar deity. It was strewed with\r\npieces of paper, which operated as charms against the dangers of the\r\ndark road he was to travel. A throng of slaves, if he were rich, was\r\nsacrificed at his obsequies. His body was burned, and the ashes,\r\ncollected in a vase, were preserved in one of the apartments of his\r\nhouse. Here we have successively the usages of the Roman Catholic, the\r\nMussulman, the Tartar, and the ancient Greek and Roman; curious\r\ncoincidences, which may show how cautious we should be in adopting\r\nconclusions founded on analogy.[109]\r\n\r\nA more extraordinary coincidence may be traced with Christian rites, in\r\nthe ceremony of naming their children. The lips and bosom of the infant\r\nwere sprinkled with water, and “the Lord was implored to permit the holy\r\ndrops to wash away the sin that was given to it before the foundation of\r\nthe world; so that the child might be born anew.”[110] We are reminded\r\nof Christian morals, in more than one of their prayers, in which they\r\nused regular forms. “Wilt thou blot us out, O Lord, forever? Is this\r\npunishment intended, not for our reformation, but for our destruction?”\r\nAgain, “Impart to us, out of thy great mercy, thy gifts, which we are\r\nnot worthy to receive through our own merits.” “Keep peace with all,”\r\nsays another petition; “bear injuries with humility; God, who sees, will\r\navenge you.” But the most striking parallel with Scripture is in the\r\nremarkable declaration that “he who looks too curiously on a woman\r\ncommits adultery with his eyes.”[111] These pure and elevated maxims, it\r\nis true, are mixed up with others of a puerile, and even brutal,\r\ncharacter, arguing that confusion of the moral perceptions which is\r\nnatural in the twilight of civilization. One would not expect, however,\r\nto meet, in such a state of society, with doctrines as sublime as any\r\ninculcated by the enlightened codes of ancient philosophy.[112]\r\n\r\nBut although the Aztec mythology gathered nothing from the beautiful\r\ninventions of the poet or from the refinements of philosophy, it was\r\nmuch indebted, as I have noticed, to the priests, who endeavored to\r\ndazzle the imagination of the people by the most formal and pompous\r\nceremonial. The influence of the priesthood must be greatest in an\r\nimperfect state of civilization, where it engrosses all the scanty\r\nscience of the time in its own body. This is particularly the case when\r\nthe science is of that spurious kind which is less occupied with the\r\nreal phenomena of nature than with the fanciful chimeras of human\r\nsuperstition. Such are the sciences of astrology and divination, in\r\nwhich the Aztec priests were well initiated; and, while they seemed to\r\nhold the keys of the future in their own hands, they impressed the\r\nignorant people with sentiments of superstitious awe, beyond that which\r\nhas probably existed in any other country,--even in ancient Egypt.\r\n\r\nThe sacerdotal order was very numerous; as may be inferred from the\r\nstatement that five thousand priests were, in some way or other,\r\nattached to the principal temple in the capital. The various ranks and\r\nfunctions of this multitudinous body were discriminated with great\r\nexactness. Those best instructed in music took the management of the\r\nchoirs. Others arranged the festivals conformably to the calendar. Some\r\nsuperintended the education of youth, and others had charge of the\r\nhieroglyphical paintings and oral traditions; while the dismal rites of\r\nsacrifice were reserved for the chief dignitaries of the order. At the\r\nhead of the whole establishment were two high-priests, elected from the\r\norder, as it would seem, by the king and principal nobles, without\r\nreference to birth, but solely for their qualifications, as shown by\r\ntheir previous conduct in a subordinate station. They were equal in\r\ndignity, and inferior only to the sovereign, who rarely acted without\r\ntheir advice in weighty matters of public concern.[113]\r\n\r\nThe priests were each devoted to the service of some particular deity,\r\nand had quarters provided within the spacious precincts of their temple;\r\nat least, while engaged in immediate attendance there,--for they were\r\nallowed to marry, and have families of their own. In this monastic\r\nresidence they lived in all the stern severity of conventual\r\ndiscipline. Thrice during the day, and once at night, they were called\r\nto prayers. They were frequent in their ablutions and vigils, and\r\nmortified the flesh by fasting and cruel penance,--drawing blood from\r\ntheir bodies by flagellation, or by piercing them with the thorns of the\r\naloe; in short, by practising all those austerities to which fanaticism\r\n(to borrow the strong language of the poet) has resorted, in every age\r\nof the world,\r\n\r\n    “In hopes to merit heaven by making earth a hell.”[114]\r\n\r\nThe great cities were divided into districts, placed under the charge of\r\na sort of parochial clergy, who regulated every act of religion within\r\ntheir precincts. It is remarkable that they administered the rites of\r\nconfession and absolution. The secrets of the confessional were held\r\ninviolable, and penances were imposed of much the same kind as those\r\nenjoined in the Roman Catholic Church. There were two remarkable\r\npeculiarities in the Aztec ceremony. The first was, that, as the\r\nrepetition of an offence once atoned for was deemed inexpiable,\r\nconfession was made but once in a man’s life, and was usually deferred\r\nto a late period of it, when the penitent unburdened his conscience and\r\nsettled at once the long arrears of iniquity.[115] Another peculiarity\r\nwas, that priestly absolution was received in place of the legal\r\npunishment of offences, and authorized an acquittal in case of arrest.\r\nLong after the Conquest, the simple natives, when they came under the\r\narm of the law, sought to escape by producing the certificate of their\r\nconfession.[116]\r\n\r\nOne of the most important duties of the priesthood was that of\r\neducation, to which certain buildings were appropriated within the\r\nenclosure of the principal temple. Here the youth of both sexes, of the\r\nhigher and middling orders, were placed at a very tender age. The girls\r\nwere intrusted to the care of priestesses; for women were allowed to\r\nexercise sacerdotal functions, except those of sacrifice.[117] In these\r\ninstitutions the boys were drilled in the routine of monastic\r\ndiscipline; they decorated the shrines of the gods with flowers, fed the\r\nsacred fires, and took part in the religious chants and festivals. Those\r\nin the higher school--the _Calmecac_, as it was called--were initiated\r\nin their traditionary lore, the mysteries of hieroglyphics, the\r\nprinciples of government, and such branches of astronomical and natural\r\nscience as were within the compass of the priesthood. The girls learned\r\nvarious feminine employments, especially to weave and embroider rich\r\ncoverings for the altars of the gods. Great attention was paid to the\r\nmoral discipline of both sexes. The most perfect decorum prevailed; and\r\noffences were punished with extreme rigor, in some instances with death\r\nitself. Terror, not love, was the spring of education with the\r\nAztecs.[118]\r\n\r\nAt a suitable age for marrying, or for entering into the world, the\r\npupils were dismissed, with much ceremony, from the convent, and the\r\nrecommendation of the principal often introduced those most competent to\r\nresponsible situations in public life. Such was the crafty policy of\r\nthe Mexican priests, who, by reserving to themselves the business of\r\ninstruction, were enabled to mould the young and plastic mind according\r\nto their own wills, and to train it early to implicit reverence for\r\nreligion and its ministers; a reverence which still maintained its hold\r\non the iron nature of the warrior, long after every other vestige of\r\neducation had been effaced by the rough trade to which he was devoted.\r\n\r\nTo each of the principal temples, lands were annexed for the maintenance\r\nof the priests. These estates were augmented by the policy or devotion\r\nof successive princes, until, under the last Montezuma, they had swollen\r\nto an enormous extent, and covered every district of the empire. The\r\npriests took the management of their property into their own hands; and\r\nthey seem to have treated their tenants with the liberality and\r\nindulgence characteristic of monastic corporations. Besides the large\r\nsupplies drawn from this source, the religious order was enriched with\r\nthe first-fruits, and such other offerings as piety or superstition\r\ndictated. The surplus beyond what was required for the support of the\r\nnational worship was distributed in alms among the poor; a duty\r\nstrenuously prescribed by their moral code. Thus we find the same\r\nreligion inculcating lessons of pure philanthropy, on the one hand, and\r\nof merciless extermination, as we shall soon see, on the other. The\r\ninconsistency will not appear incredible to those who are familiar with\r\nthe history of the Roman Catholic Church, in the early ages of the\r\nInquisition.[119]\r\n\r\nThe Mexican temples--_teocallis_, “houses of God,” as they were\r\ncalled[120]--were very numerous. There were several hundreds in each of\r\nthe principal cities, many of them, doubtless, very humble edifices.\r\nThey were solid masses of earth, cased with brick or stone, and in their\r\nform somewhat resembled the pyramidal structures of ancient Egypt. The\r\nbases of many of them were more than a hundred feet square, and they\r\ntowered to a still greater height. They were distributed into four or\r\nfive stories, each of smaller dimensions than that below. The ascent was\r\nby a flight of steps, at an angle of the pyramid, on the outside. This\r\nled to a sort of terrace, or gallery, at the base of the second story,\r\nwhich passed quite round the building to another flight of stairs,\r\ncommencing also at the same angle as the preceding and directly over it,\r\nand leading to a similar terrace; so that one had to make the circuit\r\nof the temple several times, before reaching the summit. In some\r\ninstances the stairway led directly up the centre of the western face of\r\nthe building. The top was a broad area, on which were erected one or two\r\ntowers, forty or fifty feet high, the sanctuaries in which stood the\r\nsacred images of the presiding deities. Before these towers stood the\r\ndreadful stone of sacrifice, and two lofty altars, on which fires were\r\nkept, as inextinguishable as those in the temple of Vesta. There were\r\nsaid to be six hundred of these altars, on smaller buildings within the\r\nenclosure of the great temple of Mexico, which, with those on the sacred\r\nedifices in other parts of the city, shed a brilliant illumination over\r\nits streets, through the darkest night.[121][122]\r\n\r\nFrom the construction of their temples, all religious services were\r\npublic. The long processions of priests, winding round their massive\r\nsides, as they rose higher and higher towards the summit, and the dismal\r\nrites of sacrifice performed there, were all visible from the remotest\r\ncorners of the capital, impressing on the spectator’s mind a\r\nsuperstitious veneration for the mysteries of his religion, and for the\r\ndread ministers by whom they were interpreted.\r\n\r\nThis impression was kept in full force by their numerous festivals.\r\nEvery month was consecrated to some protecting deity; and every week,\r\nnay, almost every day, was set down in their calendar for some\r\nappropriate celebration; so that it is difficult to understand how the\r\nordinary business of life could have been compatible with the exactions\r\nof religion. Many of their ceremonies were of a light and cheerful\r\ncomplexion, consisting of the national songs and dances, in which both\r\nsexes joined. Processions were made of women and children crowned with\r\ngarlands and bearing offerings of fruits, the ripened maize, or the\r\nsweet incense of copal and other odoriferous gums, while the altars of\r\nthe deity were stained with no blood save that of animals.[123] These\r\nwere the peaceful rites derived from their Toltec predecessors, on which\r\nthe fierce Aztecs engrafted a superstition too loathsome to be exhibited\r\nin all its nakedness, and one over which I would gladly draw a veil\r\naltogether, but that it would leave the reader in ignorance of their\r\nmost striking institution, and one that had the greatest influence in\r\nforming the national character.\r\n\r\nHuman sacrifices were adopted by the Aztecs early in the fourteenth\r\ncentury, about two hundred years before the Conquest.[124] Rare at\r\nfirst, they became more frequent with the wider extent of their empire;\r\ntill, at length, almost every festival was closed with this cruel\r\nabomination. These religious ceremonials were generally arranged in such\r\na manner as to afford a type of the most prominent circumstances in the\r\ncharacter or history of the deity who was the object of them. A single\r\nexample will suffice.\r\n\r\nOne of their most important festivals was that in honor of the god\r\nTezcatlipoca,[125] whose rank was inferior only to that of the Supreme\r\nBeing. He was called “the soul of the world,” and supposed to have been\r\nits creator. He was depicted as a handsome man, endowed with perpetual\r\nyouth. A year before the intended sacrifice, a captive, distinguished\r\nfor his personal beauty, and without a blemish on his body, was selected\r\nto represent this deity. Certain tutors took charge of him, and\r\ninstructed him how to perform his new part with becoming grace and\r\ndignity. He was arrayed in a splendid dress, regaled with incense and\r\nwith a profusion of sweet-scented flowers, of which the ancient Mexicans\r\nwere as fond as their descendants at the present day. When he went\r\nabroad, he was attended by a train of the royal pages, and, as he halted\r\nin the streets to play some favorite melody, the crowd prostrated\r\nthemselves before him, and did him homage as the representative of their\r\ngood deity. In this way he led an easy, luxurious life, till within a\r\nmonth of his sacrifice. Four beautiful girls, bearing the names of the\r\nprincipal goddesses, were then selected to share the honors of his bed;\r\nand with them he continued to live in idle dalliance, feasted at the\r\nbanquets of the principal nobles, who paid him all the honors of a\r\ndivinity.\r\n\r\nAt length the fatal day of sacrifice arrived. The term of his\r\nshort-lived glories was at an end. He was stripped of his gaudy apparel,\r\nand bade adieu to the fair partners of his revelries. One of the royal\r\nbarges transported him across the lake to a temple which rose on its\r\nmargin, about a league from the city. Hither the inhabitants of the\r\ncapital flocked, to witness the consummation of the ceremony. As the sad\r\nprocession wound up the sides of the pyramid, the unhappy victim threw\r\naway his gay chaplets of flowers, and broke in pieces the musical\r\ninstruments with which he had solaced the hours of captivity. On the\r\nsummit he was received by six priests, whose long and matted locks\r\nflowed disorderly over their sable robes, covered with hieroglyphic\r\nscrolls of mystic import. They led him to the sacrificial stone, a huge\r\nblock of jasper, with its upper surface somewhat convex. On this the\r\nprisoner was stretched. Five priests secured his head and his limbs;\r\nwhile the sixth, clad in a scarlet mantle, emblematic of his bloody\r\noffice, dexterously opened the breast of the wretched victim with a\r\nsharp razor of _itztli_,--a volcanic substance, hard as flint,--and,\r\ninserting his hand in the wound, tore out the palpitating heart. The\r\nminister of death, first holding this up towards the sun, an object of\r\nworship throughout Anahuac, cast it at the feet of the deity to whom the\r\ntemple was devoted, while the multitudes below prostrated themselves in\r\nhumble adoration. The tragic story of this prisoner was expounded by the\r\npriests as the type of human destiny, which, brilliant in its\r\ncommencement, too often closes in sorrow and disaster.[126]\r\n\r\nSuch was the form of human sacrifice usually practised by the Aztecs. It\r\nwas the same that often met the indignant eyes of the Europeans in their\r\nprogress through the country, and from the dreadful doom of which they\r\nthemselves were not exempted. There were, indeed, some occasions when\r\npreliminary tortures, of the most exquisite kind,--with which it is\r\nunnecessary to shock the reader,--were inflicted, but they always\r\nterminated with the bloody ceremony above described. It should be\r\nremarked, however, that such tortures were not the spontaneous\r\nsuggestions of cruelty, as with the North American Indians, but were all\r\nrigorously prescribed in the Aztec ritual, and doubtless were often\r\ninflicted with the same compunctious visitings which a devout familiar\r\nof the Holy Office might at times experience in executing its stern\r\ndecrees.[127] Women, as well as the other sex, were sometimes reserved\r\nfor sacrifice. On some occasions, particularly in seasons of drought, at\r\nthe festival of the insatiable Tlaloc, the god of rain, children, for\r\nthe most part infants, were offered up. As they were borne along in open\r\nlitters, dressed in their festal robes, and decked with the fresh\r\nblossoms of spring, they moved the hardest heart to pity, though their\r\ncries were drowned in the wild chant of the priests, who read in their\r\ntears a favorable augury for their petition. These innocent victims were\r\ngenerally bought by the priests of parents who were poor, but who\r\nstifled the voice of nature, probably less at the suggestions of poverty\r\nthan of a wretched superstition.[128]\r\n\r\nThe most loathsome part of the story--the manner in which the body of\r\nthe sacrificed captive was disposed of--remains yet to be told. It was\r\ndelivered to the warrior who had taken him in battle, and by him, after\r\nbeing dressed, was served up in an entertainment to his friends. This\r\nwas not the coarse repast of famished cannibals, but a banquet teeming\r\nwith delicious beverages and delicate viands, prepared with art, and\r\nattended by both sexes, who, as we shall see hereafter, conducted\r\nthemselves with all the decorum of civilized life. Surely, never were\r\nrefinement and the extreme of barbarism brought so closely in contact\r\nwith each other.[129]\r\n\r\nHuman sacrifices have been practised by many nations, not excepting the\r\nmost polished nations of antiquity;[130] but never by any, on a scale to\r\nbe compared with those in Anahuac. The amount of victims immolated on\r\nits accursed altars would stagger the faith of the least scrupulous\r\nbeliever. Scarcely any author pretends to estimate the yearly sacrifices\r\nthroughout the empire at less than twenty thousand, and some carry the\r\nnumber as high as fifty thousand![131]\r\n\r\nOn great occasions, as the coronation of a king or the consecration of a\r\ntemple, the number becomes still more appalling. At the dedication of\r\nthe great temple of Huitzilopochtli, in 1486, the prisoners, who for\r\nsome years had been reserved for the purpose, were drawn from all\r\nquarters to the capital. They were ranged in files, forming a procession\r\nnearly two miles long. The ceremony consumed several days, and seventy\r\nthousand captives are said to have perished at the shrine of this\r\nterrible deity! But who can believe that so numerous a body would have\r\nsuffered themselves to be led unresistingly like sheep to the slaughter?\r\nOr how could their remains, too great for consumption in\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FRA BARTOLOMÉ DE LAS CASAS]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Goupil & Cº. Paris]\r\n\r\nthe ordinary way, be disposed of, without breeding a pestilence in the\r\ncapital? Yet the event was of recent date, and is unequivocally attested\r\nby the best-informed historians.[132] One fact may be considered\r\ncertain. It was customary to preserve the skulls of the sacrificed, in\r\nbuildings appropriated to the purpose. The companions of Cortés counted\r\none hundred and thirty-six thousand in one of these edifices![133]\r\nWithout attempting a precise calculation, therefore, it is safe to\r\nconclude that thousands were yearly offered up, in the different cities\r\nof Anahuac, on the bloody altars of the Mexican divinities.[134]\r\n\r\nIndeed, the great object of war, with the Aztecs, was quite as much to\r\ngather victims for their sacrifices as to extend their empire. Hence it\r\nwas that an enemy was never slain in battle, if there were a chance of\r\ntaking him alive. To this circumstance the Spaniards repeatedly owed\r\ntheir preservation. When Montezuma was asked “why he had suffered the\r\nrepublic of Tlascala to maintain her independence on his borders,” he\r\nreplied, “that she might furnish him with victims for his gods”! As the\r\nsupply began to fail, the priests, the Dominicans of the New World,\r\nbellowed aloud for more, and urged on their superstitious sovereign by\r\nthe denunciations of celestial wrath. Like the militant churchmen of\r\nChristendom in the Middle Ages, they mingled themselves in the ranks,\r\nand were conspicuous in the thickest of the fight, by their hideous\r\naspect and frantic gestures. Strange, that, in every country, the most\r\nfiendish passions of the human heart have been those kindled in the name\r\nof religion![135]\r\n\r\nThe influence of these practices on the Aztec character was as\r\ndisastrous as might have been expected. Familiarity with the bloody\r\nrites of sacrifice steeled the heart against human sympathy, and begat a\r\nthirst for carnage, like that excited in the Romans by the exhibitions\r\nof the circus. The perpetual recurrence of ceremonies, in which the\r\npeople took part, associated religion with their most intimate concerns,\r\nand spread the gloom of superstition over the domestic hearth, until the\r\ncharacter of the nation wore a grave and even melancholy aspect, which\r\nbelongs to their descendants at the present day. The influence of the\r\npriesthood, of course, became unbounded. The sovereign thought himself\r\nhonored by being permitted to assist in the services of the temple. Far\r\nfrom limiting the authority of the priests to spiritual matters, he\r\noften surrendered his opinion to theirs, where they were least competent\r\nto give it. It was their opposition that prevented the final\r\ncapitulation which would have saved the capital. The whole nation, from\r\nthe peasant to the prince, bowed their necks to the worst kind of\r\ntyranny, that of a blind fanaticism.\r\n\r\nIn reflecting on the revolting usages recorded in the preceding pages,\r\none finds it difficult to reconcile their existence with anything like a\r\nregular form of government, or an advance in civilization.[136] Yet the\r\nMexicans had many claims to the character of a civilized community. One\r\nmay, perhaps, better understand the anomaly, by reflecting on the\r\ncondition of some of the most polished countries in Europe in the\r\nsixteenth century, after the establishment of the modern\r\nInquisition,--an institution which yearly destroyed its thousands, by a\r\ndeath more painful than the Aztec sacrifices; which armed the hand of\r\nbrother against brother, and, setting its burning seal upon the lip, did\r\nmore to stay the march of improvement than any other scheme ever devised\r\nby human cunning.\r\n\r\nHuman sacrifice, however cruel, has nothing in it degrading to its\r\nvictim. It may be rather said to ennoble him by devoting him to the\r\ngods. Although so terrible with the Aztecs, it was sometimes voluntarily\r\nembraced by them, as the most glorious death and one that opened a sure\r\npassage into paradise.[137] The Inquisition, on the other hand, branded\r\nits victims with infamy in this world, and consigned them to everlasting\r\nperdition in the next.\r\n\r\nOne detestable feature of the Aztec superstition, however, sunk it far\r\nbelow the Christian. This was its cannibalism,[138] though, in truth,\r\nthe Mexicans were not cannibals in the coarsest acceptation of the term.\r\nThey did not feed on human flesh merely to gratify a brutish appetite,\r\nbut in obedience to their religion. Their repasts were made of the\r\nvictims whose blood had been poured out on the altar of sacrifice. This\r\nis a distinction worthy of notice.[139] Still, cannibalism, under any\r\nform or whatever sanction, cannot but have a fatal influence on the\r\nnation addicted to it. It suggests ideas so loathsome, so degrading to\r\nman, to his spiritual and immortal nature, that it is impossible the\r\npeople who practise it should make any great progress in moral or\r\nintellectual culture. The Mexicans furnish no exception to this remark.\r\nThe civilization which they possessed descended from the Toltecs, a race\r\nwho never stained their altars, still less their banquets, with the\r\nblood of man.[140] All that deserved the name of science in Mexico came\r\nfrom this source; and the crumbling ruins of edifices attributed to\r\nthem, still extant in various parts of New Spain, show a decided\r\nsuperiority in their architecture over that of the later races of\r\nAnahuac. It is true, the Mexicans made great proficiency in many of the\r\nsocial and mechanic arts, in that material culture,--if I may so call\r\nit,--the natural growth of increasing opulence, which ministers to the\r\ngratification of the senses. In purely intellectual progress they were\r\nbehind the Tezcucans, whose wise sovereigns came into the abominable\r\nrites of their neighbors with reluctance and practised them on a much\r\nmore moderate scale.[141]\r\n\r\nIn this state of things, it was beneficently ordered by Providence that\r\nthe land should be delivered over to another race, who would rescue it\r\nfrom the brutish superstitions that daily extended wider and wider with\r\nextent of empire.[142] The debasing institutions of the Aztecs furnish\r\nthe best apology for their conquest. It is true, the conquerors brought\r\nalong with them the Inquisition. But they also brought Christianity,\r\nwhose benign radiance would still survive when the fierce flames of\r\nfanaticism should be extinguished; dispelling those dark forms of horror\r\nwhich had so long brooded over the fair region of Anahuac.\r\n\r\n     The most important authority in the preceding chapter, and, indeed,\r\n     wherever the Aztec religion is concerned, is Bernardino de Sahagun,\r\n     a Franciscan friar, contemporary with the Conquest. His great work,\r\n     _Historia universal de Nueva-España_, has been recently printed for\r\n     the first time. The circumstances attending its compilation and\r\n     subsequent fate form one of the most remarkable passages in\r\n     literary history.\r\n\r\n     Sahagun was born in a place of the same name, in old Spain. He was\r\n     educated at Salamanca, and, having taken the vows of St. Francis,\r\n     came over as a missionary to Mexico in the year 1529. Here he\r\n     distinguished himself by his zeal, the purity of his life, and his\r\n     unwearied exertions to spread the great truths of religion among\r\n     the natives. He was the guardian of several conventual houses,\r\n     successively, until he relinquished these cares, that he might\r\n     devote himself more unreservedly to the business of preaching, and\r\n     of compiling various works designed to illustrate the antiquities\r\n     of the Aztecs. For these literary labors he found some facilities\r\n     in the situation which he continued to occupy, of reader, or\r\n     lecturer, in the College of Santa Cruz, in the capital.\r\n\r\n     The “Universal History” was concocted in a singular manner. In\r\n     order to secure to it the greatest possible authority, he passed\r\n     some years in a Tezcucan town, where he conferred daily with a\r\n     number of respectable natives unacquainted with Castilian. He\r\n     propounded to them queries, which they, after deliberation,\r\n     answered in their usual method of writing, by hieroglyphical\r\n     paintings. These he submitted to other natives, who had been\r\n     educated under his own eye in the College of Santa Cruz; and the\r\n     latter, after a consultation among themselves, gave a written\r\n     version, in the Mexican tongue, of the hieroglyphics. This process\r\n     he repeated in another place, in some part of Mexico, and subjected\r\n     the whole to a still further revision by a third body in another\r\n     quarter. He finally arranged the combined results into a regular\r\n     history, in the form it now bears; composing it in the Mexican\r\n     language, which he could both write and speak with great accuracy\r\n     and elegance,--greater, indeed, than any Spaniard of the time.\r\n\r\n     The work presented a mass of curious information, that attracted\r\n     much attention among his brethren. But they feared its influence in\r\n     keeping alive in the natives a too vivid reminiscence of the very\r\n     superstitions which it was the great object of the Christian clergy\r\n     to eradicate. Sahagun had views more liberal than those of his\r\n     order, whose blind zeal would willingly have annihilated every\r\n     monument of art and human ingenuity which had not been produced\r\n     under the influence of Christianity. They refused to allow him the\r\n     necessary aid to transcribe his papers, which he had been so many\r\n     years in preparing, under the pretext that the expense was too\r\n     great for their order to incur. This occasioned a further delay of\r\n     several years. What was worse, his provincial got possession of his\r\n     manuscripts, which were soon scattered among the different\r\n     religious houses in the country.\r\n\r\n     In this forlorn state of his affairs, Sahagun drew up a brief\r\n     statement of the nature and contents of his work, and forwarded it\r\n     to Madrid. It fell into the hands of Don Juan de Ovando, president\r\n     of the Council for the Indies, who was so much interested in it\r\n     that he ordered the manuscripts to be restored to their author,\r\n     with the request that he would at once set about translating them\r\n     into Castilian. This was accordingly done. His papers were\r\n     recovered, though not without the menace of ecclesiastical\r\n     censures; and the octogenarian author began the work of translation\r\n     from the Mexican, in which they had been originally written by him\r\n     thirty years before. He had the satisfaction to complete the task,\r\n     arranging the Spanish version in a parallel column with the\r\n     original, and adding a vocabulary, explaining the difficult Aztec\r\n     terms and phrases; while the text was supported by the numerous\r\n     paintings on which it was founded. In this form, making two bulky\r\n     volumes in folio, it was sent to Madrid. There seemed now to be no\r\n     further reason for postponing its publication, the importance of\r\n     which could not be doubted. But from this moment it disappears; and\r\n     we hear nothing further of it, for more than two centuries, except\r\n     only as a valuable work, which had once existed and was probably\r\n     buried in some one of the numerous cemeteries of learning in which\r\n     Spain abounds.\r\n\r\n     At length, towards the close of the last century, the indefatigable\r\n     Muñoz succeeded in disinterring the long-lost manuscript from the\r\n     place tradition had assigned to it,--the library of a convent at\r\n     Tolosa, in Navarre, the northern extremity of Spain. With his usual\r\n     ardor, he transcribed the whole work with his own hands, and added\r\n     it to the inestimable collection, of which, alas! he was destined\r\n     not to reap the full benefit himself. From this transcript Lord\r\n     Kingsborough was enabled to procure the copy which was published in\r\n     1830, in the sixth volume of his magnificent compilation. In it he\r\n     expresses an honest satisfaction at being the first to give\r\n     Sahagun’s works to the world. But in this supposition he was\r\n     mistaken. The very year preceding, an edition of it, with\r\n     annotations, appeared in Mexico, in three volumes octavo. It was\r\n     prepared by Bustamante,--a scholar to whose editorial activity his\r\n     country is largely indebted,--from a copy of the Muñoz manuscript\r\n     which came into his possession. Thus this remarkable work, which\r\n     was denied the honors of the press during the author’s lifetime,\r\n     after passing into oblivion, reappeared, at the distance of nearly\r\n     three centuries, not in his own country, but in foreign lands\r\n     widely remote from each other, and that almost simultaneously. The\r\n     story is extraordinary, though unhappily not so extraordinary in\r\n     Spain as it would be elsewhere.\r\n\r\n     Sahagun divided his history into twelve books. The first eleven are\r\n     occupied with the social institutions of Mexico, and the last with\r\n     the Conquest. On the religion of the country he is particularly\r\n     full. His great object evidently was, to give a clear view of its\r\n     mythology, and of the burdensome ritual which belonged to it.\r\n     Religion entered so intimately into the most private concerns and\r\n     usages of the Aztecs, that Sahagun’s work must be a text-book for\r\n     every student of their antiquities. Torquemada availed himself of a\r\n     manuscript copy, which fell into his hands before it was sent to\r\n     Spain, to enrich his own pages,--a circumstance more fortunate for\r\n     his readers than for Sahagun’s reputation, whose work, now that it\r\n     is published, loses much of the originality and interest which\r\n     would otherwise attach to it. In one respect it is invaluable; as\r\n     presenting a complete collection of the various forms of prayer,\r\n     accommodated to every possible emergency, in use by the Mexicans.\r\n     They are often clothed in dignified and beautiful language, showing\r\n     that sublime speculative tenets are quite compatible with the most\r\n     degrading practices of superstition. It is much to be regretted\r\n     that we have not the eighteen hymns inserted by the author in his\r\n     book, which would have particular interest, as the only specimen of\r\n     devotional poetry preserved of the Aztecs. The hieroglyphical\r\n     paintings, which accompanied the text, are also missing. If they\r\n     have escaped the hands of fanaticism, both may reappear at some\r\n     future day.\r\n\r\n     Sahagun produced several other works, of a religious or\r\n     philological character. Some of these were voluminous, but none\r\n     have been printed. He lived to a very advanced age, closing a life\r\n     of activity and usefulness, in 1590, in the capital of Mexico. His\r\n     remains were followed to the tomb by a numerous concourse of his\r\n     own countrymen, and of the natives, who lamented in him the loss of\r\n     unaffected piety, benevolence, and learning.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IV\r\n\r\nMEXICAN HIEROGLYPHICS--MANUSCRIPTS--ARITHMETIC--CHRONOLOGY--ASTRONOMY\r\n\r\n\r\nIt is a relief to turn from the gloomy pages of the preceding chapter to\r\na brighter side of the picture, and to contemplate the same nation in\r\nits generous struggle to raise itself from a state of barbarism and to\r\ntake a positive rank in the scale of civilization. It is not the less\r\ninteresting, that these efforts were made on an entirely new theatre of\r\naction, apart from those influences that operate in the Old World; the\r\ninhabitants of which, forming one great brotherhood of nations, are knit\r\ntogether by sympathies that make the faintest spark of knowledge, struck\r\nout in one quarter, spread gradually wider and wider, until it has\r\ndiffused a cheering light over the remotest. It is curious to observe\r\nthe human mind, in this new position, conforming to the same laws as on\r\nthe ancient continent, and taking a similar direction in its first\r\ninquiries after truth,--so similar, indeed, as, although not warranting,\r\nperhaps, the idea of imitation, to suggest at least that of a common\r\norigin.\r\n\r\nIn the Eastern hemisphere we find some nations, as the Greeks, for\r\ninstance, early smitten with such a love of the beautiful as to be\r\nunwilling to dispense with it even in the graver productions of\r\nscience; and other nations, again, proposing a severer end to\r\nthemselves, to which even imagination and elegant art were made\r\nsubservient. The productions of such a people must be criticised, not by\r\nthe ordinary rules of taste, but by their adaptation to the peculiar end\r\nfor which they were designed. Such were the Egyptians in the Old\r\nWorld,[143] and the Mexicans in the New. We have already had occasion to\r\nnotice the resemblance borne by the latter nation to the former in their\r\nreligious economy. We shall be more struck with it in their scientific\r\nculture, especially their hieroglyphical writing and their astronomy.\r\n\r\nTo describe actions and events by delineating visible objects seems to\r\nbe a natural suggestion, and is practised, after a certain fashion, by\r\nthe rudest savages. The North American Indian carves an arrow on the\r\nbark of trees to show his followers the direction of his march, and some\r\nother sign to show the success of his expeditions. But to paint\r\nintelligibly a consecutive series of these actions--forming what\r\nWarburton has happily called _picture-writing_[144]--requires a\r\ncombination of ideas that amounts to a positively intellectual effort.\r\nYet further, when the object of the painter, instead of being limited to\r\nthe present, is to penetrate the past, and to gather from its dark\r\nrecesses lessons of instruction for coming generations, we see the\r\ndawnings of a literary culture, and recognize the proof of a decided\r\ncivilization in the attempt itself, however imperfectly it may be\r\nexecuted. The literal imitation of objects will not answer for this more\r\ncomplex and extended plan. It would occupy too much space, as well as\r\ntime in the execution. It then becomes necessary to abridge the\r\npictures, to confine the drawing to outlines, or to such prominent parts\r\nof the bodies delineated as may readily suggest the whole. This is the\r\n_representative_ or _figurative_ writing, which forms the lowest stage\r\nof hieroglyphics.\r\n\r\nBut there are things which have no type in the material world; abstract\r\nideas, which can only be represented by visible objects supposed to have\r\nsome quality analogous to the idea intended. This constitutes\r\n_symbolical_ writing, the most difficult of all to the interpreter,\r\nsince the analogy between the material and immaterial object is often\r\npurely fanciful, or local in its application. Who, for instance, could\r\nsuspect the association which made a beetle represent the universe, as\r\nwith the Egyptians, or a serpent typify time, as with the Aztecs?\r\n\r\nThe third and last division is the _phonetic_, in which signs are made\r\nto represent sounds, either entire words, or parts of them. This is the\r\nnearest approach of the hieroglyphical series to that beautiful\r\ninvention, the alphabet, by which language is resolved into its\r\nelementary sounds, and an apparatus supplied for easily and accurately\r\nexpressing the most delicate shades of thought.\r\n\r\nThe Egyptians were well skilled in all three kinds of hieroglyphics.\r\nBut, although their public monuments display the first class, in their\r\nordinary intercourse and written records it is now certain that they\r\nalmost wholly relied on the phonetic character. Strange that, having\r\nthus broken down the thin partition which divided them from an alphabet,\r\ntheir latest monuments should exhibit no nearer approach to it than\r\ntheir earliest.[145] The Aztecs, also, were acquainted with the several\r\nvarieties of hieroglyphics. But they relied on the figurative infinitely\r\nmore than on the others. The Egyptians were at the top of the scale, the\r\nAztecs at the bottom.\r\n\r\nIn casting the eye over a Mexican manuscript, or map, as it is called,\r\none is struck with the grotesque caricatures it exhibits of the human\r\nfigure; monstrous, overgrown heads, on puny, misshapen bodies, which are\r\nthemselves hard and angular in their outlines, and without the least\r\nskill in composition. On closer inspection, however, it is obvious that\r\nit is not so much a rude attempt to delineate nature, as a conventional\r\nsymbol, to express the idea in the most clear and forcible manner; in\r\nthe same way as the pieces of similar value on a chess-board, while they\r\ncorrespond with one another in form, bear little resemblance, usually,\r\nto the objects they represent. Those parts of the figure are most\r\ndistinctly traced which are the most important. So, also, the coloring,\r\ninstead of the delicate gradations of nature, exhibits only gaudy and\r\nviolent contrasts, such as may produce the most vivid impression. “For\r\neven colors,” as Gama observes, “speak in the Aztec hieroglyphics.”[146]\r\n\r\nBut in the execution of all this the Mexicans were much inferior to the\r\nEgyptians. The drawings of the latter, indeed, are exceedingly\r\ndefective, when criticised by the rules of art; for they were as\r\nignorant of perspective as the Chinese, and only exhibited the head in\r\nprofile, with the eye in the centre, and with total absence of\r\nexpression. But they handled the pencil more gracefully than the Aztecs,\r\nwere more true to the natural forms of objects, and, above all, showed\r\ngreat superiority in abridging the original figure by giving only the\r\noutline, or some characteristic or essential feature. This simplified\r\nthe process, and facilitated the communication of thought. An Egyptian\r\ntext has almost the appearance of alphabetical writing in its regular\r\nlines of minute figures. A Mexican text looks usually like a collection\r\nof pictures, each one forming the subject of a separate study. This is\r\nparticularly the case with the delineations of mythology; in which the\r\nstory is told by a conglomeration of symbols, that may remind one more\r\nof the mysterious anaglyphs sculptured on the temples of the Egyptians,\r\nthan of their written records.\r\n\r\nThe Aztecs had various emblems for expressing such things as, from their\r\nnature, could not be directly represented by the painter; as, for\r\nexample, the years, months, days, the seasons, the elements, the\r\nheavens, and the like. A “tongue” denoted speaking; a “footprint,”\r\ntravelling; a “man sitting on the ground,” an earthquake. These symbols\r\nwere often very arbitrary, varying with the caprice of the writer; and\r\nit requires a nice discrimination to interpret them, as a slight change\r\nin the form or position of the figure intimated a very different\r\nmeaning.[147] An ingenious writer asserts that the priests devised\r\nsecret symbolic characters for the record of their religious mysteries.\r\nIt is possible. But the researches of Champollion lead to the conclusion\r\nthat the similar opinion formerly entertained respecting the Egyptian\r\nhieroglyphics is without foundation.[148]\r\n\r\nLastly, they employed, as above stated, phonetic signs, though these\r\nwere chiefly confined to the names of persons and places; which, being\r\nderived from some circumstance or characteristic quality, were\r\naccommodated to the hieroglyphical system. Thus, the town _Cimatlan_ was\r\ncompounded of _cimatl_, a “root,” which grew near it, and _tlan_,\r\nsignifying “near;” _Tlaxcallan_ meant “the place of bread,” from its\r\nrich fields of corn; _Huexotzinco_, “a place surrounded by willows.” The\r\nnames of persons were often significant of their adventures and\r\nachievements. That of the great Tezcucan prince Nezahualcoyotl signified\r\n“hungry fox,” intimating his sagacity, and his distresses in early\r\nlife.[149] The emblems of such names were no sooner seen, than they\r\nsuggested to every Mexican the person and place intended, and, when\r\npainted on their shields or embroidered on their banners, became the\r\narmorial bearings by which city and chieftain were distinguished, as in\r\nEurope in the age of chivalry.[150]\r\n\r\nBut, although the Aztecs were instructed in all the varieties of\r\nhieroglyphical painting, they chiefly resorted to the clumsy method of\r\ndirect representation. Had their empire lasted, like the Egyptian,\r\nseveral thousand years, instead of the brief space of two hundred, they\r\nwould doubtless, like them, have advanced to the more frequent use of\r\nthe phonetic writing. But, before they could be made acquainted with the\r\ncapabilities of their own system, the Spanish Conquest, by introducing\r\nthe European alphabet, supplied their scholars with a more perfect\r\ncontrivance for expressing thought, which soon supplanted the ancient\r\npictorial character.[151]\r\n\r\nClumsy as it was, however, the Aztec picture-writing seems to have been\r\nadequate to the demands of the nation, in their imperfect state of\r\ncivilization. By means of it were recorded all their laws, and even\r\ntheir regulations for domestic economy; their tribute-rolls, specifying\r\nthe imposts of the various towns; their mythology, calendars, and\r\nrituals; their political annals, carried back to a period long before\r\nthe foundation of the city. They digested a complete system of\r\nchronology, and could specify with accuracy the dates of the most\r\nimportant events in their history; the year being inscribed on the\r\nmargin, against the particular circumstance recorded. It is true,\r\nhistory, thus executed, must necessarily be vague and fragmentary. Only\r\na few leading incidents could be presented. But in this it did not\r\ndiffer much from the monkish chronicles of the dark ages, which often\r\ndispose of years in a few brief sentences,--quite long enough for the\r\nannals of barbarians.[152]\r\n\r\nIn order to estimate aright the picture-writing of the Aztecs, one must\r\nregard it in connection with oral tradition, to which it was auxiliary.\r\nIn the colleges of the priests the youth were instructed in astronomy,\r\nhistory, mythology, etc.; and those who were to follow the profession of\r\nhieroglyphical painting were taught the application of the characters\r\nappropriated to each of these branches. In an historical work, one had\r\ncharge of the chronology, another of the events. Every part of the labor\r\nwas thus mechanically distributed.[153] The pupils, instructed in all\r\nthat was before known in their several departments, were prepared to\r\nextend still further the boundaries of their imperfect science. The\r\nhieroglyphics served as a sort of stenography, a collection of notes,\r\nsuggesting to the initiated much more than could be conveyed by a\r\nliteral interpretation. This combination of the written and the oral\r\ncomprehended what may be called the literature of the Aztecs.[154]\r\n\r\nTheir manuscripts were made of different materials,--of cotton cloth, or\r\nskins nicely prepared; of a composition of silk and gum; but, for the\r\nmost part, of a fine fabric from the leaves of the aloe, _agave\r\nAmericana_, called by the natives _maguey_, which grows luxuriantly over\r\nthe table-lands of Mexico. A sort of paper was made from it, resembling\r\nsomewhat the Egyptian _papyrus_,[155] which, when properly dressed and\r\npolished, is said to have been more soft and beautiful than parchment.\r\nSome of the specimens, still existing, exhibit their original freshness,\r\nand the paintings on them retain their brilliancy of colors. They were\r\nsometimes done up into rolls, but more frequently into volumes, of\r\nmoderate size, in which the paper was shut up, like a folding screen,\r\nwith a leaf or tablet of wood at each extremity, that gave the whole,\r\nwhen closed, the appearance of a book. The length of the strips was\r\ndetermined only by convenience. As the pages might be read and referred\r\nto separately, this form had obvious advantages over the rolls of the\r\nancients.[156]\r\n\r\nAt the time of the arrival of the Spaniards, great quantities of these\r\nmanuscripts were treasured up in the country. Numerous persons were\r\nemployed in painting, and the dexterity of their operations excited the\r\nastonishment of the Conquerors. Unfortunately, this was mingled with\r\nother and unworthy feelings. The strange, unknown characters inscribed\r\non them excited suspicion. They were looked on as magic scrolls, and\r\nwere regarded in the same light with the idols and temples, as the\r\nsymbols of a pestilent superstition, that must be extirpated. The first\r\narchbishop of Mexico, Don Juan de Zumárraga,--a name that should be as\r\nimmortal as that of Omar,--collected these paintings from every quarter,\r\nespecially from Tezcuco, the most cultivated capital in Anahuac, and\r\nthe great depository of the national archives. He then caused them to\r\nbe piled up in a “mountain-heap”--as it is called by the Spanish writers\r\nthemselves--in the market-place of Tlatelolco, and reduced them all to\r\nashes![157] His greater countryman, Archbishop Ximenes, had celebrated a\r\nsimilar _auto-da-fé_ of Arabic manuscripts, in Granada, some twenty\r\nyears before. Never did fanaticism achieve two more signal triumphs than\r\nby the annihilation of so many curious monuments of human ingenuity and\r\nlearning![158]\r\n\r\nThe unlettered soldiers were not slow in imitating the example of their\r\nprelate. Every chart and volume which fell into their hands was wantonly\r\ndestroyed; so that, when the scholars of a later and more enlightened\r\nage anxiously sought to recover some of these memorials of civilization,\r\nnearly all had perished, and the few surviving were jealously hidden by\r\nthe natives.[159] Through the indefatigable labors of a private\r\nindividual, however, a considerable collection was eventually deposited\r\nin the archives of Mexico,[160] but was so little heeded there that some\r\nwere plundered, others decayed piecemeal from the damps and mildews, and\r\nothers, again, were used up as waste paper![161] We contemplate with\r\nindignation the cruelties inflicted by the early conquerors. But\r\nindignation is qualified with contempt when we see them thus ruthlessly\r\ntrampling out the spark of knowledge, the common boon and property of\r\nall mankind. We may well doubt which has the stronger claim to\r\ncivilization, the victor or the vanquished.\r\n\r\nA few of the Mexican manuscripts have found their way, from time to\r\ntime, to Europe, and are carefully preserved in the public libraries of\r\nits capitals. They are brought together in the magnificent work of Lord\r\nKingsborough; but not one is there from Spain. The most important of\r\nthem, for the light it throws on the Aztec institutions, is the Mendoza\r\nCodex; which, after its mysterious disappearance for more than a\r\ncentury, has at length reappeared in the Bodleian Library at Oxford. It\r\nhas been several times engraved.[162] The most brilliant in coloring,\r\nprobably, is the Borgian collection, in Rome.[163] The most curious,\r\nhowever, is the Dresden Codex, which has excited less attention than it\r\ndeserves. Although usually classed among Mexican manuscripts, it bears\r\nlittle resemblance to them in its execution; the figures of objects are\r\nmore delicately drawn, and the characters, unlike the Mexican, appear to\r\nbe purely arbitrary, and are possibly phonetic.[164] Their regular\r\narrangement is quite equal to the Egyptian. The whole infers a much\r\nhigher civilization than the Aztec, and offers abundant food for curious\r\nspeculation.[165]\r\n\r\nSome few of these maps have interpretations annexed to them, which were\r\nobtained from the natives after the Conquest.[166] The greater part are\r\nwithout any, and cannot now be unriddled. Had the Mexicans made free use\r\nof a phonetic alphabet, it might have been originally easy, by mastering\r\nthe comparatively few signs employed in this kind of communication, to\r\nhave got a permanent key to the whole.[167] A brief inscription has\r\nfurnished a clue to the vast labyrinth of Egyptian hieroglyphics. But\r\nthe Aztec characters, representing individuals, or, at most, species,\r\nrequire to be made out separately; a hopeless task, for which little aid\r\nis to be expected from the vague and general tenor of the few\r\ninterpretations now existing. There was, as already mentioned, until\r\nlate in the last century, a professor in the University of Mexico,\r\nespecially devoted to the study of the national picture-writing. But, as\r\nthis was with a view to legal proceedings, his information, probably,\r\nwas limited to deciphering titles. In less than a hundred years after\r\nthe Conquest, the knowledge of the hieroglyphics had so far declined\r\nthat a diligent Tezcucan writer complains he could find in the country\r\nonly two persons, both very aged, at all competent to interpret\r\nthem.[168]\r\n\r\nIt is not probable, therefore, that the art of reading these\r\npicture-writings will ever be recovered; a circumstance certainly to be\r\nregretted. Not that the records of a semi-civilized people would be\r\nlikely to contain any new truth or discovery important to human comfort\r\nor progress; but they could scarcely fail to throw some additional light\r\non the previous history of the nation, and that of the more polished\r\npeople who before occupied the country.[169] This would be still more\r\nprobable, if any literary relics of their Toltec predecessors were\r\npreserved; and, if report be true, an important compilation from this\r\nsource was extant at the time of the invasion, and may have perhaps\r\ncontributed to swell the holocaust of Zumárraga.[170] It is no great\r\nstretch of fancy to suppose that such records might reveal the\r\nsuccessive links in the mighty chain of migration of the primitive\r\nraces, and, by carrying us back to the seat of their possessions in the\r\nOld World, have solved the mystery which has so long perplexed the\r\nlearned, in regard to the settlement and civilization of the New.[171]\r\n\r\nBesides the hieroglyphical maps, the traditions of the country were\r\nembodied in the songs and hymns, which, as already mentioned, were\r\ncarefully taught in the public schools. These were various, embracing\r\nthe mythic legends of a heroic age, the warlike achievements of their\r\nown, or the softer tales of love and pleasure.[172] Many of them were\r\ncomposed by scholars and persons of rank, and are cited as affording the\r\nmost authentic record of events.[173] The Mexican dialect was rich and\r\nexpressive, though inferior to the Tezcucan, the most polished of the\r\nidioms of Anahuac. None of the Aztec compositions have survived, but we\r\ncan form some estimate of the general state of poetic culture from the\r\nodes which have come down to us from the royal house of Tezcuco.[174]\r\nSahagun has furnished us with translations of their more elaborate\r\nprose, consisting of prayers and public discourses, which give a\r\nfavorable idea of their eloquence, and show that they paid much\r\nattention to rhetorical effect. They are said to have had, also,\r\nsomething like theatrical exhibitions, of a pantomimic sort, in which\r\nthe faces of the performers were covered with masks, and the figures of\r\nbirds or animals were frequently represented; an imitation to which they\r\nmay have been led by the familiar delineation of such objects in their\r\nhieroglyphics.[175] In all this we see the dawning of a literary\r\nculture, surpassed, however, by their attainments in the severer walks\r\nof mathematical science.\r\n\r\nThey devised a system of notation in their arithmetic sufficiently\r\nsimple. The first twenty numbers were expressed by a corresponding\r\nnumber of dots. The first five had specific names; after which they were\r\nrepresented by combining the fifth with one of the four preceding; as\r\nfive and one for six, five and two for seven, and so on. Ten and fifteen\r\nhad each a separate name, which was also combined with the first four,\r\nto express a higher quantity. These four, therefore, were the radical\r\ncharacters of their oral arithmetic, in the same manner as they were of\r\nthe written with the ancient Romans; a more simple arrangement,\r\nprobably, than any existing among Europeans.[176] Twenty was expressed\r\nby a separate hieroglyphic,--a flag. Larger sums were reckoned by\r\ntwenties, and, in writing, by repeating the number of flags. The square\r\nof twenty, four hundred, had a separate sign, that of a plume, and so\r\nhad the cube of twenty, or eight thousand, which was denoted by a purse,\r\nor sack. This was the whole arithmetical apparatus of the Mexicans, by\r\nthe combination of which they were enabled to indicate any quantity. For\r\ngreater expedition, they used to denote fractions of the larger sums by\r\ndrawing only a part of the object. Thus, half or three-fourths of a\r\nplume, or of a purse, represented that proportion of their respective\r\nsums, and so on.[177] With all this, the machinery will appear very\r\nawkward to us, who perform our operations with so much ease by means of\r\nthe Arabic or, rather, Indian ciphers. It is not much more awkward,\r\nhowever, than the system pursued by the great mathematicians of\r\nantiquity, unacquainted with the brilliant invention, which has given a\r\nnew aspect to mathematical science, of determining the value, in a great\r\nmeasure, by the relative position of the figures.\r\n\r\nIn the measurement of time, the Aztecs adjusted their civil year by the\r\nsolar. They divided it into eighteen months of twenty days each. Both\r\nmonths and days were expressed by peculiar hieroglyphics,--those of the\r\nformer often intimating the season of the year, like the French months\r\nat the period of the Revolution. Five complementary days, as in\r\nEgypt,[178] were added, to make up the full number of three hundred and\r\nsixty-five. They belonged to no month, and were regarded as peculiarly\r\nunlucky. A month was divided into four weeks, of five days each, on the\r\nlast of which was the public fair, or market-day.[179] This arrangement,\r\ndiffering from that of the nations of the Old Continent, whether of\r\nEurope or Asia,[180] has the advantage of giving an equal number of days\r\nto each month, and of comprehending entire weeks, without a fraction,\r\nboth in the months and in the year.[181]\r\n\r\nAs the year is composed of nearly six hours more than three hundred and\r\nsixty-five days, there still remained an excess, which, like other\r\nnations who have framed a calendar, they provided for by intercalation;\r\nnot, indeed, every fourth year, as the Europeans,[182] but at longer\r\nintervals, like some of the Asiatics.[183] They waited till the\r\nexpiration of fifty-two vague years, when they interposed thirteen days,\r\nor rather twelve and a half, this being the number which had fallen in\r\narrear. Had they inserted thirteen, it would have been too much, since\r\nthe annual excess over three hundred and sixty-five is about eleven\r\nminutes less than six hours. But, as their calendar at the time of the\r\nConquest was found to correspond with the European (making allowance for\r\nthe subsequent Gregorian reform), they would seem to have adopted the\r\nshorter period of twelve days and a half,[184] which brought them,\r\nwithin an almost inappreciable fraction, to the exact length of the\r\ntropical year, as established by the most accurate observations.[185]\r\nIndeed, the intercalation of twenty-five days in every hundred and four\r\nyears shows a nicer adjustment of civil to solar time than is presented\r\nby any European calendar; since more than five centuries must elapse\r\nbefore the loss of an entire day.[186] Such was the astonishing\r\nprecision displayed by the Aztecs, or, perhaps, by their more polished\r\nToltec predecessors, in these computations, so difficult as to have\r\nbaffled, till a comparatively recent period, the most enlightened\r\nnations of Christendom![187]\r\n\r\nThe chronological system of the Mexicans, by which they determined the\r\ndate of any particular event, was also very remarkable. The epoch from\r\nwhich they reckoned corresponded with the year 1091 of the Christian\r\nera. It was the period of the reform of their calendar, soon after their\r\nmigration from Aztlan. They threw the years, as already noticed, into\r\ngreat cycles, of fifty-two each, which they called “sheafs,” or\r\n“bundles,” and represented by a quantity of reeds bound together by a\r\nstring. As often as this hieroglyphic occurs in their maps, it shows the\r\nnumber of half-centuries. To enable them to specify any particular year,\r\nthey divided the great cycle into four smaller cycles, or indictions,\r\nof thirteen years each. They then adopted two periodical series of\r\nsigns, one consisting of their numerical dots, up to thirteen, the\r\nother, of four hieroglyphics of the years.[188] These latter they\r\nrepeated in regular succession, setting against each one a number of the\r\ncorresponding series of dots, continued also in regular succession up to\r\nthirteen. The same system was pursued through the four indictions, which\r\nthus, it will be observed, began always with a different hieroglyphic of\r\nthe year from the preceding; and in this way each of the hieroglyphics\r\nwas made to combine successively with each of the numerical signs, but\r\nnever twice with the same; since four, and thirteen, the factors of\r\nfifty-two,--the number of years in the cycle,--must admit of just as\r\nmany combinations as are equal to their product. Thus every year had its\r\nappropriate symbol, by which it was at once recognized. And this symbol,\r\npreceded by the proper number of “bundles” indicating the\r\nhalf-centuries, showed the precise time which had elapsed since the\r\nnational epoch of 1091.[189] The ingenious contrivance of a periodical\r\nseries, in place of the cumbrous system of hieroglyphical notation, is\r\nnot peculiar to the Aztecs, and is to be found among various nations on\r\nthe Asiatic continent,--the same in principle, though varying\r\nmaterially in arrangement.[190]\r\n\r\nThe solar calendar above described might have answered all the purposes\r\nof the people; but the priests chose to construct another for\r\nthemselves. This was called a “lunar reckoning,” though nowise\r\naccommodated to the revolutions of the moon.[191] It was formed, also,\r\nof two periodical series, one of them consisting of thirteen numerical\r\nsigns, or dots, the other, of the twenty hieroglyphics of the days.\r\nBut, as the product of these combinations would be only 260, and as some\r\nconfusion might arise from the repetition of the same terms for the\r\nremaining 105 days of the year, they invented a third series, consisting\r\nof nine additional hieroglyphics, which, alternating with the two\r\npreceding series, rendered it impossible that the three should coincide\r\ntwice in the same year, or indeed in less than 2340 days; since 20 × 13\r\n× 9 = 2340.[192] Thirteen was a mystic number, of frequent use in their\r\ntables.[193] Why they resorted to that of nine, on this occasion, is not\r\nso clear.[194]\r\n\r\nThis second calendar rouses a holy indignation in the early Spanish\r\nmissionaries, and Father Sahagun loudly condemns it, as “most\r\nunhallowed, since it is founded neither on natural reason, nor on the\r\ninfluence of the planets, nor on the true course of the year; but is\r\nplainly the work of necromancy, and the fruit of a compact with the\r\nDevil!”[195] One may doubt whether the superstition of those who\r\ninvented the scheme was greater than that of those who thus impugned it.\r\nAt all events, we may, without having recourse to supernatural agency,\r\nfind in the human heart a sufficient explanation of its origin; in that\r\nlove of power, that has led the priesthood of many a faith to affect a\r\nmystery the key to which was in their own keeping.\r\n\r\nBy means of this calendar, the Aztec priests kept their own records,\r\nregulated the festivals and seasons of sacrifice, and made all their\r\nastrological calculations.[196] The false science of astrology is\r\nnatural to a state of society partially civilized, where the mind,\r\nimpatient of the slow and cautious examination by which alone it can\r\narrive at truth, launches at once into the regions of speculation, and\r\nrashly attempts to lift the veil--the impenetrable veil--which is drawn\r\naround the mysteries of nature. It is the characteristic of true science\r\nto discern the impassable, but not very obvious, limits which divide the\r\nprovince of reason from that of speculation. Such knowledge comes\r\ntardily. How many ages have rolled away, in which powers that, rightly\r\ndirected, might have revealed the great laws of nature, have been wasted\r\nin brilliant but barren reveries on alchemy and astrology!\r\n\r\nThe latter is more particularly the study of a primitive age; when the\r\nmind, incapable of arriving at the stupendous fact that the myriads of\r\nminute lights glowing in the firmament are the centres of systems as\r\nglorious as our own, is naturally led to speculate on their probable\r\nuses, and to connect them in some way or other with man, for whose\r\nconvenience every other object in the universe seems to have been\r\ncreated. As the eye of the simple child of nature watches, through the\r\nlong nights, the stately march of the heavenly bodies, and sees the\r\nbright hosts coming up, one after another, and changing with the\r\nchanging seasons of the year, he naturally associates them with those\r\nseasons, as the periods over which they hold a mysterious influence. In\r\nthe same manner, he connects their appearance with any interesting\r\nevent of the time, and explores, in their flaming characters, the\r\ndestinies of the new-born infant.[197] Such is the origin of astrology,\r\nthe false lights of which have continued from the earliest ages to\r\ndazzle and bewilder mankind, till they have faded away in the superior\r\nillumination of a comparatively recent period.\r\n\r\nThe astrological scheme of the Aztecs was founded less on the planetary\r\ninfluences than on those of the arbitrary signs they had adopted for the\r\nmonths and days. The character of the leading sign in each lunar cycle\r\nof thirteen days gave a complexion to the whole; though this was\r\nqualified in some degree by the signs of the succeeding days, as well as\r\nby those of the hours. It was in adjusting these conflicting forces that\r\nthe great art of the diviner was shown. In no country, not even in\r\nancient Egypt, were the dreams of the astrologer more implicitly\r\ndeferred to. On the birth of a child, he was instantly summoned. The\r\ntime of the event was accurately ascertained; and the family hung in\r\ntrembling suspense, as the minister of Heaven cast the horoscope of the\r\ninfant and unrolled the dark volume of destiny. The influence of the\r\npriest was confessed by the Mexican in the very first breath which he\r\ninhaled.[198]\r\n\r\nWe know little further of the astronomical attainments of the Aztecs.\r\nThat they were acquainted with the cause of eclipses is evident from the\r\nrepresentation, on their maps, of the disk of the moon projected on that\r\nof the sun.[199] Whether they had arranged a system of constellations is\r\nuncertain; though that they recognized some of the most obvious, as the\r\nPleiades, for example, is evident from the fact that they regulated\r\ntheir festivals by them. We know of no astronomical instruments used by\r\nthem, except the dial.[200] An immense circular block of carved stone,\r\ndisinterred in 1790, in the great square of Mexico, has supplied an\r\nacute and learned scholar with the means of establishing some\r\ninteresting facts in regard to Mexican science.[201] This colossal\r\nfragment, on which the calendar[202] is engraved, shows that they had\r\nthe means of settling the hours of the day with precision, the periods\r\nof the solstices and of the equinoxes, and that of the transit of the\r\nsun across the zenith of Mexico.[203]\r\n\r\nWe cannot contemplate the astronomical science of the Mexicans, so\r\ndisproportioned to their progress in other walks of civilization,\r\nwithout astonishment. An acquaintance with some of the more obvious\r\nprinciples of astronomy is within the reach of the rudest people. With a\r\nlittle care, they may learn to connect the regular changes of the\r\nseasons with those of the place of the sun at his rising and setting.\r\nThey may follow the march of the great luminary through the heavens, by\r\nwatching the stars that first brighten on his evening track or fade in\r\nhis morning beams. They may measure a revolution of the moon, by marking\r\nher phases, and may even form a general idea of the number of such\r\nrevolutions in a solar year. But that they should be capable of\r\naccurately adjusting their festivals by the movements of the heavenly\r\nbodies, and should fix the true length of the tropical year, with a\r\nprecision unknown to the great philosophers of antiquity, could be the\r\nresult only of a long series of nice and patient observations, evincing\r\nno slight progress in civilization.[204] But whence could the rude\r\ninhabitants of these mountain-regions have derived this curious\r\nerudition? Not from the barbarous hordes who roamed over the higher\r\nlatitudes of the North; nor from the more polished races on the Southern\r\ncontinent, with whom, it is apparent, they had no intercourse. If we are\r\ndriven, in our embarrassment, like the greatest astronomer of our age,\r\nto seek the solution among the civilized communities of Asia, we shall\r\nstill be perplexed by finding, amidst general resemblance of outline,\r\nsufficient discrepancy in the details to vindicate, in the judgments of\r\nmany, the Aztec claim to originality.[205]\r\n\r\nI shall conclude the account of Mexican science with that of a\r\nremarkable festival, celebrated by the natives at the termination of the\r\ngreat cycle of fifty-two years. We have seen, in the preceding chapter,\r\ntheir tradition of the destruction of the world at four successive\r\nepochs. They looked forward confidently to another such catastrophe, to\r\ntake place, like the preceding, at the close of a cycle, when the sun\r\nwas to be effaced from the heavens, the human race from the earth, and\r\nwhen the darkness of chaos was to settle on the habitable globe. The\r\ncycle would end in the latter part of December, and as the dreary season\r\nof the winter solstice approached, and the diminished light of day gave\r\nmelancholy presage of its speedy extinction, their apprehensions\r\nincreased; and on the arrival of the five “unlucky” days which closed\r\nthe year they abandoned themselves to despair.[206] They broke in pieces\r\nthe little images of their household gods, in whom they no longer\r\ntrusted. The holy fires were suffered to go out in the temples, and none\r\nwere lighted in their own dwellings. Their furniture and domestic\r\nutensils were destroyed; their garments torn in pieces; and every thing\r\nwas thrown into disorder, for the coming of the evil genii who were to\r\ndescend on the desolate earth.\r\n\r\nOn the evening of the last day, a procession of priests, assuming the\r\ndress and ornaments of their gods, moved from the capital towards a\r\nlofty mountain, about two leagues distant. They carried with them a\r\nnoble victim, the flower of their captives, and an apparatus for\r\nkindling the _new fire_, the success of which was an augury of the\r\nrenewal of the cycle. On reaching the summit of the mountain, the\r\nprocession paused till midnight; when, as the constellation of the\r\nPleiades approached the zenith,[207] the _new fire_ was kindled by the\r\nfriction of the sticks placed on the wounded breast of the victim.[208]\r\nThe flame was soon communicated to a funeral pile, on which the body of\r\nthe slaughtered captive was thrown. As the light streamed up towards\r\nheaven, shouts of joy and triumph burst forth from the countless\r\nmultitudes who covered the hills, the terraces of the temples, and the\r\nhouse-tops, with eyes anxiously bent on the mount of sacrifice.\r\nCouriers, with torches lighted at the blazing beacon, rapidly bore them\r\nover every part of the country; and the cheering element was seen\r\nbrightening on altar and hearthstone, for the circuit of many a league,\r\nlong before the sun, rising on his accustomed track, gave assurance that\r\na new cycle had commenced its march, and that the laws of nature were\r\nnot to be reversed for the Aztecs.\r\n\r\nThe following thirteen days were given up to festivity. The houses were\r\ncleansed and whitened. The broken vessels were replaced by new ones. The\r\npeople, dressed in their gayest apparel, and crowned with garlands and\r\nchaplets of flowers, thronged in joyous procession to offer up their\r\noblations and thanksgivings in the temples. Dances and games were\r\ninstituted, emblematical of the regeneration of the world. It was the\r\ncarnival of the Aztecs; or rather the national jubilee, the great\r\nsecular festival, like that of the Romans, or ancient Etruscans, which\r\nfew alive had witnessed before, or could expect to see again.[209]\r\n\r\n     M. de Humboldt remarked, many years ago, “It were to be wished that\r\n     some government would publish at its own expense the remains of the\r\n     ancient American civilization; for it is only by the comparison of\r\n     several monuments that we can succeed in discovering the meaning of\r\n     these allegories, which are partly astronomical and partly mystic.”\r\n     This enlightened wish has now been realized, not by any\r\n     government, but by a private individual, Lord Kingsborough. The\r\n     great work published under his auspices, and so often cited in this\r\n     Introduction, appeared in London in 1830. When completed it will\r\n     reach to nine volumes, seven of which are now before the public.\r\n     Some idea of its magnificence may be formed by those who have not\r\n     seen it, from the fact that copies of it, with colored plates, sold\r\n     originally at £175, and, with uncolored, at £120. The price has\r\n     been since much reduced. It is designed to exhibit a complete view\r\n     of the ancient Aztec MSS., with such few interpretations as exist;\r\n     the beautiful drawings of Castañeda relating to Central America,\r\n     with the commentary of Dupaix; the unpublished history of Father\r\n     Sahagun; and, last, not least, the copious annotations of his\r\n     lordship.\r\n\r\n     Too much cannot be said of the mechanical execution of the\r\n     book,--its splendid typography, the apparent accuracy and the\r\n     delicacy of the drawings, and the sumptuous quality of the\r\n     materials. Yet the purchaser would have been saved some superfluous\r\n     expense, and the reader much inconvenience, if the letter-press had\r\n     been in volumes of an ordinary size. But it is not uncommon, in\r\n     works on this magnificent plan, to find utility in some measure\r\n     sacrificed to show.\r\n\r\n     The collection of Aztec MSS., if not perfectly complete, is very\r\n     extensive, and reflects great credit on the diligence and research\r\n     of the compiler. It strikes one as strange, however, that not a\r\n     single document should have been drawn from Spain. Peter Martyr\r\n     speaks of a number having been brought thither in his time. (De\r\n     Insulis nuper Inventis, p. 368.) The Marquis Spineto examined one\r\n     in the Escorial, being the same with the Mendoza Codex, and perhaps\r\n     the original, since that at Oxford is but a copy. (Lectures, Lect.\r\n     7.) Mr. Waddilove, chaplain of the British embassy to Spain, gave a\r\n     particular account of one to Dr. Robertson, which he saw in the\r\n     same library and considered an Aztec calendar. Indeed, it is\r\n     scarcely possible that the frequent voyagers to the New World\r\n     should not have furnished the mother-country with abundant\r\n     specimens of this most interesting feature of Aztec civilization.\r\n     Nor should we fear that the present liberal government would\r\n     seclude these treasures from the inspection of the scholar.\r\n\r\n     Much cannot be said in favor of the arrangement of these codices.\r\n     In some of them, as the Mendoza Codex, for example, the plates are\r\n     not even numbered; and one who would study them by the\r\n     corresponding interpretation must often bewilder himself in the\r\n     maze of hieroglyphics, without a clue to guide him. Neither is\r\n     there any attempt to enlighten us as to the positive value and\r\n     authenticity of the respective documents, or even their previous\r\n     history, beyond a barren reference to the particular library from\r\n     which they have been borrowed. Little light, indeed, can be\r\n     expected on these matters; but we have not that little. The defect\r\n     of arrangement is chargeable on other parts of the work. Thus, for\r\n     instance, the sixth book of Sahagun is transferred from the body of\r\n     the history to which it belongs, to a preceding volume; while the\r\n     grand hypothesis of his lordship, for which the work was\r\n     concocted, is huddled into notes, hitched on random passages of the\r\n     text, with a good deal less connection than the stories of Queen\r\n     Scheherezade, in the “Arabian Nights,” and not quite so\r\n     entertaining.\r\n\r\n     The drift of Lord Kingsborough’s speculations is, to establish the\r\n     colonization of Mexico by the Israelites. To this the whole battery\r\n     of his logic and learning is directed. For this, hieroglyphics are\r\n     unriddled, manuscripts compared, monuments delineated. His theory,\r\n     however, whatever be its merits, will scarcely become popular;\r\n     since, instead of being exhibited in a clear and comprehensive\r\n     form, readily embraced by the mind, it is spread over an infinite\r\n     number of notes, thickly sprinkled with quotations from languages\r\n     ancient and modern, till the weary reader, floundering about in the\r\n     ocean of fragments, with no light to guide him, feels like Milton’s\r\n     Devil, working his way through chaos,--\r\n\r\n                              “neither sea,\r\n    Nor good dry land; nigh foundered, on he fares.”\r\n\r\n     It would be unjust, however, not to admit that the noble author, if\r\n     his logic is not always convincing, shows much acuteness in\r\n     detecting analogies; that he displays familiarity with his subject,\r\n     and a fund of erudition, though it often runs to waste; that,\r\n     whatever be the defects of arrangement, he has brought together a\r\n     most rich collection of unpublished materials to illustrate the\r\n     Aztec and, in a wider sense, American antiquities; and that by this\r\n     munificent undertaking, which no government, probably, would have,\r\n     and few individuals could have, executed, he has entitled himself\r\n     to the lasting gratitude of every friend of science.\r\n\r\n     Another writer whose works must be diligently consulted by every\r\n     student of Mexican antiquities is Antonio Gama. His life contains\r\n     as few incidents as those of most scholars. He was born at Mexico,\r\n     in 1735, of a respectable family, and was bred to the law. He early\r\n     showed a preference for mathematical studies, conscious that in\r\n     this career lay his strength. In 1771 he communicated his\r\n     observations on the eclipse of that year to the French astronomer\r\n     M. de Lalande, who published them in Paris, with high commendations\r\n     of the author. Gama’s increasing reputation attracted the attention\r\n     of government; and he was employed by it in various scientific\r\n     labors of importance. His great passion, however, was the study of\r\n     Indian antiquities. He made himself acquainted with the history of\r\n     the native races, their traditions, their languages, and, as far as\r\n     possible, their hieroglyphics. He had an opportunity of showing the\r\n     fruits of this preparatory training, and his skill as an antiquary,\r\n     on the discovery of the great calendar stone, in 1790. He produced\r\n     a masterly treatise on this, and another Aztec monument, explaining\r\n     the objects to which they were devoted, and pouring a flood of\r\n     light on the astronomical science of the aborigines, their\r\n     mythology, and their astrological system. He afterwards continued\r\n     his investigations in the same path, and wrote treatises on the\r\n     dial, hieroglyphics, and arithmetic of the Indians. These, however,\r\n     were not given to the world till a few years since, when they were\r\n     published, together with a reprint of the former work, under the\r\n     auspices of the industrious Bustamante. Gama died in 1802, leaving\r\n     behind him a reputation for great worth in private life,--one in\r\n     which the bigotry that seems to enter too frequently into the\r\n     character of the Spanish-Mexican was tempered by the liberal\r\n     feelings of a man of science. His reputation as a writer stands\r\n     high for patient acquisition, accuracy, and acuteness. His\r\n     conclusions are neither warped by the love of theory so common in\r\n     the philosopher, nor by the easy credulity so natural to the\r\n     antiquary. He feels his way with the caution of a mathematician,\r\n     whose steps are demonstrations. M. de Humboldt was largely indebted\r\n     to his first work, as he has emphatically acknowledged. But,\r\n     notwithstanding the eulogiums of this popular writer, and his own\r\n     merits, Gama’s treatises are rarely met with out of New Spain, and\r\n     his name can hardly be said to have a transatlantic reputation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER V\r\n\r\nAZTEC AGRICULTURE--MECHANICAL ARTS--MERCHANTS--DOMESTIC MANNERS\r\n\r\n\r\nIt is hardly possible that a nation so far advanced as the Aztecs in\r\nmathematical science should not have made considerable progress in the\r\nmechanical arts, which are so nearly connected with it. Indeed,\r\nintellectual progress of any kind implies a degree of refinement that\r\nrequires a certain cultivation of both useful and elegant art. The\r\nsavage wandering through the wide forest, without shelter for his head\r\nor raiment for his back, knows no other wants than those of animal\r\nappetites, and, when they are satisfied, seems to himself to have\r\nanswered the only ends of existence. But man, in society, feels numerous\r\ndesires, and artificial tastes spring up, accommodated to the various\r\nrelations in which he is placed, and perpetually stimulating his\r\ninvention to devise new expedients to gratify them.\r\n\r\nThere is a wide difference in the mechanical skill of different nations;\r\nbut the difference is still greater in the inventive power which directs\r\nthis skill and makes it available. Some nations seem to have no power\r\nbeyond that of imitation, or, if they possess invention, have it in so\r\nlow a degree that they are constantly repeating the same idea, without\r\na shadow of alteration or improvement; as the bird builds precisely the\r\nsame kind of nest which those of its own species built at the beginning\r\nof the world. Such, for example, are the Chinese, who have probably been\r\nfamiliar for ages with the germs of some discoveries,[210] of little\r\npractical benefit to themselves, but which, under the influence of\r\nEuropean genius, have reached a degree of excellence that has wrought an\r\nimportant change in the constitution of society.\r\n\r\nFar from looking back and forming itself slavishly on the past, it is\r\ncharacteristic of the European intellect to be ever on the advance. Old\r\ndiscoveries become the basis of new ones. It passes onward from truth to\r\ntruth, connecting the whole by a succession of links, as it were, into\r\nthe great chain of science which is to encircle and bind together the\r\nuniverse. The light of learning is shed over the labors of art. New\r\navenues are opened for the communication both of person and of thought.\r\nNew facilities are devised for subsistence. Personal comforts, of every\r\nkind, are inconceivably multiplied, and brought within the reach of the\r\npoorest. Secure of these, the thoughts travel into a nobler region than\r\nthat of the senses; and the appliances of art are made to minister to\r\nthe demands of an elegant taste and a higher moral culture.\r\n\r\nThe same enlightened spirit, applied to agriculture, raises it from a\r\nmere mechanical drudgery, or the barren formula of traditional precepts,\r\nto the dignity of a science. As the composition of the earth is\r\nanalyzed, man learns the capacity of the soil that he cultivates; and,\r\nas his empire is gradually extended over the elements of nature, he\r\ngains the power to stimulate her to her most bountiful and various\r\nproduction. It is with satisfaction that we can turn to the land of our\r\nfathers, as the one in which the experiment has been conducted on the\r\nbroadest scale and attended with results that the world has never before\r\nwitnessed. With equal truth, we may point to the Anglo-Saxon race in\r\nboth hemispheres, as that whose enterprising genius has contributed most\r\nessentially to the great interests of humanity, by the application of\r\nscience to the useful arts.\r\n\r\nHusbandry, to a very limited extent, indeed, was practised by most of\r\nthe rude tribes of North America. Wherever a natural opening in the\r\nforest, or a rich strip of _interval_, met their eyes, or a green slope\r\nwas found along the rivers, they planted it with beans and Indian\r\ncorn.[211] The cultivation was slovenly in the extreme, and could not\r\nsecure the improvident natives from the frequent recurrence of\r\ndesolating famines. Still, that they tilled the soil at all was a\r\npeculiarity which honorably distinguished them from other tribes of\r\nhunters, and raised them one degree higher in the scale of\r\ncivilization.\r\n\r\nAgriculture in Mexico was in the same advanced state as the other arts\r\nof social life. In few countries, indeed, has it been more respected. It\r\nwas closely interwoven with the civil and religious institutions of the\r\nnation. There were peculiar deities to preside over it; the names of the\r\nmonths and of the religious festivals had more or less reference to it.\r\nThe public taxes, as we have seen, were often paid in agricultural\r\nproduce. All except the soldiers and great nobles, even the inhabitants\r\nof the cities, cultivated the soil. The work was chiefly done by the\r\nmen; the women scattering the seed, husking the corn, and taking part\r\nonly in the lighter labors of the field.[212] In this they presented an\r\nhonorable contrast to the other tribes of the continent, who imposed the\r\nburden of agriculture, severe as it is in the North, on their\r\nwomen.[213] Indeed, the sex was as tenderly regarded by the Aztecs in\r\nthis matter, as it is, in most parts of Europe, at the present day.\r\n\r\nThere was no want of judgment in the management of their ground. When\r\nsomewhat exhausted, it was permitted to recover by lying fallow. Its\r\nextreme dryness was relieved by canals, with which the land was\r\npartially irrigated; and the same end was promoted by severe penalties\r\nagainst the destruction of the woods, with which the country, as already\r\nnoticed, was well covered before the Conquest. Lastly, they provided for\r\ntheir harvests ample granaries, which were admitted by the Conquerors to\r\nbe of admirable construction. In this provision we see the forecast of\r\ncivilized man.[214]\r\n\r\nAmong the most important articles of husbandry, we may notice the\r\nbanana, whose facility of cultivation and exuberant returns are so fatal\r\nto habits of systematic and hardy industry.[215] Another celebrated\r\nplant was the cacao, the fruit of which furnished the chocolate,--from\r\nthe Mexican _chocolatl_,--now so common a beverage throughout\r\nEurope.[216] The vanilla, confined to a small district of the sea-coast,\r\nwas used for the same purposes, of flavoring their food and drink, as\r\nwith us.[217] The great staple of the country, as, indeed, of the\r\nAmerican continent, was maize, or Indian corn,[218] which grew freely\r\nalong the valleys, and up the steep sides of the Cordilleras to the high\r\nlevel of the table-land. The Aztecs were as curious in its preparation,\r\nand as well instructed in its manifold uses, as the most expert New\r\nEngland housewife. Its gigantic stalks, in these equinoctial regions,\r\nafford a saccharine matter, not found to the same extent in northern\r\nlatitudes, and supplied the natives with sugar little inferior to that\r\nof the cane itself, which was not introduced among them till after the\r\nConquest.[219] But the miracle of nature was the great Mexican aloe, or\r\n_maguey_, whose clustering pyramids of flowers, towering above their\r\ndark coronals of leaves, were seen sprinkled over many a broad acre of\r\nthe table-land. As we have already noticed, its bruised leaves afforded\r\na paste from which paper was manufactured;[220] its juice was fermented\r\ninto an intoxicating beverage, _pulque_, of which the natives, to this\r\nday, are excessively fond;[221] its leaves further supplied an\r\nimpenetrable thatch for the more humble dwellings; thread, of which\r\ncoarse stuffs were made, and strong cords, were drawn from its tough and\r\ntwisted fibres; pins and needles were made of the thorns at the\r\nextremity of its leaves; and the root, when properly cooked, was\r\nconverted into a palatable and nutritious food. The _agave_,[222] in\r\nshort, was meat, drink, clothing, and writing-materials, for the Aztec!\r\nSurely, never did Nature enclose in so compact a form so many of the\r\nelements of human comfort and civilization![223]\r\n\r\nIt would be obviously out of place to enumerate in these pages all the\r\nvarieties of plants, many of them of medicinal virtue, which have been\r\nintroduced from Mexico into Europe. Still less can I attempt a catalogue\r\nof its flowers, which, with their variegated and gaudy colors, form the\r\ngreatest attraction of our greenhouses. The opposite climates embraced\r\nwithin the narrow latitudes of New Spain have given to it, probably, the\r\nrichest and most diversified flora to be found in any country on the\r\nglobe. These different products were systematically arranged by the\r\nAztecs, who understood their properties, and collected them into\r\nnurseries, more extensive than any then existing in the Old World. It is\r\nnot improbable that they suggested the idea of those “gardens of plants”\r\nwhich were introduced into Europe not many years after the\r\nConquest.[224]\r\n\r\nThe Mexicans were as well acquainted with the mineral as with the\r\nvegetable treasures of their kingdom. Silver, lead, and tin they drew\r\nfrom the mines of Tasco; copper from the mountains of Zacotollan. These\r\nwere taken not only from the crude masses on the surface, but from veins\r\nwrought in the solid rock, into which they opened extensive galleries.\r\nIn fact, the traces of their labors furnished the best indications for\r\nthe early Spanish miners.[225] Gold, found on the surface, or gleaned\r\nfrom the beds of rivers, was cast into bars, or, in the form of dust,\r\nmade part of the regular tribute of the southern provinces of the\r\nempire. The use of iron, with which the soil was impregnated, was\r\nunknown to them. Notwithstanding its abundance, it demands so many\r\nprocesses to prepare it for use that it has commonly been one of the\r\nlast metals pressed into the service of man. The age of iron has\r\nfollowed that of brass, in fact as well as in fiction.[226]\r\n\r\nThey found a substitute in an alloy of tin and copper, and, with tools\r\nmade of this bronze, could cut not only metals, but, with the aid of a\r\nsilicious dust, the hardest substances, as basalt, porphyry, amethysts,\r\nand emeralds.[227] They fashioned these last, which were found very\r\nlarge, into many curious and fantastic forms. They cast, also, vessels\r\nof gold and silver, carving them with their metallic chisels in a very\r\ndelicate manner. Some of the silver vases were so large that a man could\r\nnot encircle them with his arms. They imitated very nicely the figures\r\nof animals, and, what was extraordinary, could mix the metals in such a\r\nmanner that the feathers of a bird, or the scales of a fish, should be\r\nalternately of gold and silver. The Spanish goldsmiths admitted their\r\nsuperiority over themselves in these ingenious works.[228]\r\n\r\nThey employed another tool, made of _itztli_, or obsidian, a dark\r\ntransparent mineral, exceedingly hard, found in abundance in their\r\nhills. They made it into knives, razors, and their serrated swords. It\r\ntook a keen edge, though soon blunted. With this they wrought the\r\nvarious stones and alabasters employed in the construction of their\r\npublic works and principal dwellings. I shall defer a more particular\r\naccount of these to the body of the narrative, and will only add here\r\nthat the entrances and angles of the buildings were profusely ornamented\r\nwith images, sometimes of their fantastic deities, and frequently of\r\nanimals.[229] The latter were executed with great accuracy. “The\r\nformer,” according to Torquemada, “were the hideous reflection of their\r\nown souls. And it was not till after they had been converted to\r\nChristianity that they could model the true figure of a man.”[230] The\r\nold chronicler’s facts are well founded, whatever we may think of his\r\nreasons. The allegorical phantasms of his religion, no doubt, gave a\r\ndirection to the Aztec artist, in his delineation of the human figure;\r\nsupplying him with an imaginary beauty in the personification of\r\ndivinity itself. As these superstitions lost their hold on his mind, it\r\nopened to the influences of a purer taste; and, after the Conquest, the\r\nMexicans furnished many examples of correct, and some of beautiful,\r\nportraiture.\r\n\r\nSculptured images were so numerous that the foundations of the cathedral\r\nin the _plaza mayor_, the great square of Mexico, are said to be\r\nentirely composed of them.[231] This spot may, indeed, be regarded as\r\nthe Aztec forum,--the great depository of the treasures of ancient\r\nsculpture, which now lie hid in its bosom. Such monuments are spread all\r\nover the capital, however, and a new cellar can hardly be dug, or\r\nfoundation laid, without turning up some of the mouldering relics of\r\nbarbaric art. But they are little heeded, and, if not wantonly broken in\r\npieces at once, are usually worked into the rising wall or supports of\r\nthe new edifice.[232] Two celebrated bas-reliefs of the last Montezuma\r\nand his father, cut in the solid rock, in the beautiful groves of\r\nChapoltepec, were deliberately destroyed, as late as the eighteenth\r\ncentury, by order of the government![233] The monuments of the barbarian\r\nmeet with as little respect from civilized man as those of the civilized\r\nman from the barbarian.[234]\r\n\r\nThe most remarkable piece of sculpture yet disinterred is the great\r\ncalendar stone, noticed in the preceding chapter. It consists of dark\r\nporphyry, and in its original dimensions, as taken from the quarry, is\r\ncomputed to have weighed nearly fifty tons. It was transported from the\r\nmountains beyond Lake Chalco, a distance of many leagues, over a broken\r\ncountry intersected by watercourses and canals. In crossing a bridge\r\nwhich traversed one of these latter, in the capital, the supports gave\r\nway, and the huge mass was precipitated into the water, whence it was\r\nwith difficulty recovered. The fact that so enormous a fragment of\r\nporphyry could be thus safely carried for leagues, in the face of such\r\nobstacles, and without the aid of cattle,--for the Aztecs, as already\r\nmentioned, had no animals of draught,--suggests to us no mean ideas of\r\ntheir mechanical skill, and of their machinery, and implies a degree of\r\ncultivation little inferior to that demanded for the geometrical and\r\nastronomical science displayed in the inscriptions on this very\r\nstone.[235][236]\r\n\r\nThe ancient Mexicans made utensils of earthenware for the ordinary\r\npurposes of domestic life, numerous specimens of which still\r\nexist.[237] They made cups and vases of a lackered or painted wood,\r\nimpervious to wet and gaudily colored. Their dyes were obtained from\r\nboth mineral and vegetable substances. Among them was the rich crimson\r\nof the cochineal, the modern rival of the famed Tyrian purple. It was\r\nintroduced into Europe from Mexico, where the curious little insect was\r\nnourished with great care on plantations of cactus, since fallen into\r\nneglect.[238] The natives were thus enabled to give a brilliant coloring\r\nto the webs which were manufactured, of every degree of fineness, from\r\nthe cotton raised in abundance throughout the warmer regions of the\r\ncountry. They had the art, also, of interweaving with these the delicate\r\nhair of rabbits and other animals, which made a cloth of great warmth as\r\nwell as beauty, of a kind altogether original; and on this they often\r\nlaid a rich embroidery, of birds, flowers, or some other fanciful\r\ndevice.[239]\r\n\r\nBut the art in which they most delighted was their _plumaje_, or\r\nfeather-work. With this they could produce all the effect of a beautiful\r\nmosaic. The gorgeous plumage of the tropical birds, especially of the\r\nparrot tribe, afforded every variety of color; and the fine down of the\r\nhumming-bird, which revelled in swarms among the honeysuckle bowers of\r\nMexico, supplied them with soft aerial tints that gave an exquisite\r\nfinish to the picture. The feathers, pasted on a fine cotton web, were\r\nwrought into dresses for the wealthy, hangings for apartments, and\r\nornaments for the temples. No one of the American fabrics excited such\r\nadmiration in Europe, whither numerous specimens were sent by the\r\nConquerors. It is to be regretted that so graceful an art should have\r\nbeen suffered to fall into decay.[240]\r\n\r\nThere were no shops in Mexico, but the various manufactures and\r\nagricultural products were brought together for sale in the great\r\nmarketplaces of the principal cities. Fairs were held there every fifth\r\nday, and were thronged by a numerous concourse of persons, who came to\r\nbuy or sell from all the neighboring country. A particular quarter was\r\nallotted to each kind of article. The numerous transactions were\r\nconducted without confusion, and with entire regard to justice, under\r\nthe inspection of magistrates appointed for the purpose. The traffic was\r\ncarried on partly by barter, and partly by means of a regulated\r\ncurrency, of different values. This consisted of transparent quills of\r\ngold dust; of bits of tin, cut in the form of a [Illustration: bold\r\nletter, sans-serif T]; and of bags of cacao, containing a specified\r\nnumber of grains. “Blessed money,” exclaims Peter Martyr, “which exempts\r\nits possessors from avarice, since it cannot be long hoarded, nor hidden\r\nunder ground!”[241]\r\n\r\nThere did not exist in Mexico that distinction of castes found among the\r\nEgyptian and Asiatic nations. It was usual, however, for the son to\r\nfollow the occupation of his father. The different trades were arranged\r\ninto something like guilds; each having a particular district of the\r\ncity appropriated to it, with its own chief, its own tutelar deity, its\r\npeculiar festivals, and the like. Trade was held in avowed estimation by\r\nthe Aztecs. “Apply thyself, my son,” was the advice of an aged chief,\r\n“to agriculture, or to feather-work, or some other honorable calling.\r\nThus did your ancestors before you. Else how would they have provided\r\nfor themselves and their families? Never was it heard that nobility\r\nalone was able to maintain its possessor.”[242] Shrewd maxims, that must\r\nhave sounded somewhat strange in the ear of a Spanish _hidalgo_![243]\r\n\r\nBut the occupation peculiarly respected was that of the merchant. It\r\nformed so important and singular a feature of their social economy as to\r\nmerit a much more particular notice than it has received from\r\nhistorians. The Aztec merchant was a sort of itinerant trader, who made\r\nhis journeys to the remotest borders of Anahuac, and to the countries\r\nbeyond, carrying with him merchandise of rich stuffs, jewelry, slaves,\r\nand other valuable commodities. The slaves were obtained at the great\r\nmarket of Azcapozalco, not many leagues from the capital, where fairs\r\nwere regularly held for the sale of these unfortunate beings. They were\r\nbrought thither by their masters, dressed in their gayest apparel, and\r\ninstructed to sing, dance, and display their little stock of personal\r\naccomplishments, so as to recommend themselves to the purchaser.\r\nSlave-dealing was an honorable calling among the Aztecs.[244]\r\n\r\nWith this rich freight, the merchant visited the different provinces,\r\nalways bearing some present of value from his own sovereign to their\r\nchiefs, and usually receiving others in return, with a permission to\r\ntrade. Should this be denied him, or should he meet with indignity or\r\nviolence, he had the means of resistance in his power. He performed his\r\njourneys with a number of companions of his own rank, and a large body\r\nof inferior attendants who were employed to transport the goods. Fifty\r\nor sixty pounds were the usual load for a man. The whole caravan went\r\narmed, and so well provided against sudden hostilities that they could\r\nmake good their defence, if necessary, till reinforced from home. In one\r\ninstance, a body of these militant traders stood a siege of four years\r\nin the town of Ayotlan, which they finally took from the enemy.[245]\r\nTheir own government, however, was always prompt to embark in a war on\r\nthis ground, finding it a very convenient pretext for extending the\r\nMexican empire. It was not unusual to allow the merchants to raise\r\nlevies themselves, which were placed under their command. It was,\r\nmoreover, very common for the prince to employ the merchants as a sort\r\nof spies, to furnish him information of the state of the countries\r\nthrough which they passed, and the dispositions of the inhabitants\r\ntowards himself.[246]\r\n\r\nThus their sphere of action was much enlarged beyond that of a humble\r\ntrader, and they acquired a high consideration in the body politic. They\r\nwere allowed to assume insignia and devices of their own. Some of their\r\nnumber composed what is called by the Spanish writers a council of\r\nfinance; at least, this was the case in Tezcuco.[247] They were much\r\nconsulted by the monarch, who had some of them constantly near his\r\nperson, addressing them by the title of “uncle,” which may remind one of\r\nthat of _primo_, or “cousin,” by which a grandee of Spain is saluted by\r\nhis sovereign. They were allowed to have their own courts, in which\r\ncivil and criminal cases, not excepting capital, were determined; so\r\nthat they formed an independent community, as it were, of themselves.\r\nAnd, as their various traffic supplied them with abundant stores of\r\nwealth, they enjoyed many of the most essential advantages of an\r\nhereditary aristocracy.[248]\r\n\r\nThat trade should prove the path to eminent political preferment in a\r\nnation but partially civilized, where the names of soldier and priest\r\nare usually the only titles to respect, is certainly an anomaly in\r\nhistory. It forms some contrast to the standard of the more polished\r\nmonarchies of the Old World, in which rank is supposed to be less\r\ndishonored by a life of idle ease or frivolous pleasure than by those\r\nactive pursuits which promote equally the prosperity of the state and of\r\nthe individual. If civilization corrects many prejudices, it must be\r\nallowed that it creates others.\r\n\r\nWe shall be able to form a better idea of the actual refinement of the\r\nnatives by penetrating into their domestic life and observing the\r\nintercourse between the sexes. We have, fortunately, the means of doing\r\nthis. We shall there find the ferocious Aztec frequently displaying all\r\nthe sensibility of a cultivated nature; consoling his friends under\r\naffliction, or congratulating them on their good fortune, as on occasion\r\nof a marriage, or of the birth or the baptism of a child, when he was\r\npunctilious in his visits, bringing presents of costly dresses and\r\nornaments, or the more simple offering of flowers, equally indicative of\r\nhis sympathy. The visits at these times, though regulated with all the\r\nprecision of Oriental courtesy, were accompanied by expressions of the\r\nmost cordial and affectionate regard.[249]\r\n\r\nThe discipline of children, especially at the public schools, as stated\r\nin a previous chapter, was exceedingly severe.[250] But after she had\r\ncome to a mature age the Aztec maiden was treated by her parents with a\r\ntenderness from which all reserve seemed banished. In the counsels to a\r\ndaughter about to enter into life, they conjured her to preserve\r\nsimplicity in her manners and conversation, uniform neatness in her\r\nattire, with strict attention to personal cleanliness. They inculcated\r\nmodesty, as the great ornament of a woman, and implicit reverence for\r\nher husband; softening their admonitions by such endearing epithets as\r\nshowed the fulness of a parent’s love.[251]\r\n\r\nPolygamy was permitted among the Mexicans, though chiefly confined,\r\nprobably, to the wealthiest classes.[252] And the obligations of the\r\nmarriage vow, which was made with all the formality of a religious\r\nceremony, were fully recognized, and impressed on both parties. The\r\nwomen are described by the Spaniards as pretty, unlike their unfortunate\r\ndescendants of the present day, though with the same serious and rather\r\nmelancholy cast of countenance. Their long black hair, covered, in some\r\nparts of the country, by a veil made of the fine web of the _pita_,\r\nmight generally be seen wreathed with flowers, or, among the richer\r\npeople, with strings of precious stones, and pearls from the Gulf of\r\nCalifornia. They appear to have been treated with much consideration by\r\ntheir husbands, and passed their time in indolent tranquillity, or in\r\nsuch feminine occupations as spinning, embroidery, and the like, while\r\ntheir maidens beguiled the hours by the rehearsal of traditionary tales\r\nand ballads.[253]\r\n\r\nThe women partook equally with the men of social festivities and\r\nentertainments. These were often conducted on a large scale, both as\r\nregards the number of guests and the costliness of the preparations.\r\nNumerous attendants, of both sexes, waited at the banquet. The halls\r\nwere scented with perfumes, and the courts strewed with odoriferous\r\nherbs and flowers, which were distributed in profusion among the guests,\r\nas they arrived. Cotton napkins and ewers of water were placed before\r\nthem, as they took their seats at the board; for the venerable ceremony\r\nof ablution[254] before and after eating was punctiliously observed by\r\nthe Aztecs.[255] Tobacco was then offered to the company, in pipes,\r\nmixed up with aromatic substances, or in the form of cigars, inserted in\r\ntubes of tortoise-shell or silver. They compressed the nostrils with the\r\nfingers, while they inhaled the smoke, which they frequently swallowed.\r\nWhether the women, who sat apart from the men at table, were allowed the\r\nindulgence of the fragrant weed, as in the most polished circles of\r\nmodern Mexico, is not told us. It is a curious fact that the Aztecs also\r\ntook the dried leaf in the pulverized form of snuff.[256]\r\n\r\nThe table was well provided with substantial meats, especially game;\r\namong which the most conspicuous was the turkey, erroneously supposed,\r\nas its name imports, to have come originally from the East.[257] These\r\nmore solid dishes were flanked by others of vegetables and fruits, of\r\nevery delicious variety found on the North American continent. The\r\ndifferent viands were prepared in various ways, with delicate sauces and\r\nseasoning, of which the Mexicans were very fond. Their palate was still\r\nfurther regaled by confections and pastry, for which their maize-flour\r\nand sugar supplied ample materials. One other dish, of a disgusting\r\nnature, was sometimes added to the feast, especially when the\r\ncelebration partook of a religious character. On such occasions a slave\r\nwas sacrificed, and his flesh, elaborately dressed, formed one of the\r\nchief ornaments of the banquet. Cannibalism, in the guise of an\r\nEpicurean science, becomes even the more revolting.[258]\r\n\r\nThe meats were kept warm by chafing-dishes. The table was ornamented\r\nwith vases of silver, and sometimes gold, of delicate workmanship. The\r\ndrinking-cups and spoons were of the same costly materials, and likewise\r\nof tortoise-shell. The favorite beverage was the _chocolatl_, flavored\r\nwith vanilla and different spices. They had a way of preparing the froth\r\nof it, so as to make it almost solid enough to be eaten, and took it\r\ncold.[259] The fermented juice of the maguey, with a mixture of sweets\r\nand acids, supplied, also, various agreeable drinks, of different\r\ndegrees of strength, and formed the chief beverage of the elder part of\r\nthe company.[260]\r\n\r\nAs soon as they had finished their repast, the young people rose from\r\nthe table, to close the festivities of the day with dancing. They danced\r\ngracefully, to the sound of various instruments, accompanying their\r\nmovements with chants of a pleasing though somewhat plaintive\r\ncharacter.[261] The older guests continued at table, sipping _pulque_,\r\nand gossiping about other times, till the virtues of the exhilarating\r\nbeverage put them in good humor with their own. Intoxication was not\r\nrare in this part of the company, and, what is singular, was excused in\r\nthem, though severely punished in the younger. The entertainment was\r\nconcluded by a liberal distribution of rich dresses and ornaments among\r\nthe guests, when they withdrew, after midnight, “some commending the\r\nfeast, and others condemning the bad taste or extravagance of their\r\nhost; in the same manner,” says an old Spanish writer, “as with\r\nus.”[262] Human nature is, indeed, much the same all the world over.\r\n\r\nIn this remarkable picture of manners, which I have copied faithfully\r\nfrom the records of earliest date after the Conquest, we find no\r\nresemblance to the other races of North American Indians. Some\r\nresemblance we may trace to the general style of Asiatic pomp and\r\nluxury. But in Asia, woman, far from being admitted to unreserved\r\nintercourse with the other sex, is too often jealously immured within\r\nthe walls of the harem. European civilization, which accords to this\r\nloveliest portion of creation her proper rank in the social scale, is\r\nstill more removed from some of the brutish usages of the Aztecs. That\r\nsuch usages should have existed with the degree of refinement they\r\nshowed in other things is almost inconceivable. It can only be explained\r\nas the result of religious superstition; superstition which clouds the\r\nmoral perception, and perverts even the natural senses, till man,\r\ncivilized\r\n\r\n[Illustration: OUR LADY OF GUADALOUPE]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Goupil & Cº. Paris_]\r\n\r\nman, is reconciled to the very things which are most revolting to\r\nhumanity. Habits and opinions founded on religion must not be taken as\r\nconclusive evidence of the actual refinement of a people.\r\n\r\nThe Aztec character was perfectly original and unique. It was made up of\r\nincongruities apparently irreconcilable. It blended into one the marked\r\npeculiarities of different nations, not only of the same phase of\r\ncivilization, but as far removed from each other as the extremes of\r\nbarbarism and refinement. It may find a fitting parallel in their own\r\nwonderful climate, capable of producing, on a few square leagues of\r\nsurface, the boundless variety of vegetable forms which belong to the\r\nfrozen regions of the North, the temperate zone of Europe, and the\r\nburning skies of Arabia and Hindostan.\r\n\r\n     One of the works repeatedly consulted and referred to in this\r\n     Introduction is Boturini’s _Idea de una nueva Historia general de\r\n     la América Septentrional_. The singular persecutions sustained by\r\n     its author, even more than the merits of his book, have associated\r\n     his name inseparably with the literary history of Mexico. The\r\n     Chevalier Lorenzo Boturini Benaduci was a Milanese by birth, of an\r\n     ancient family, and possessed of much learning. From Madrid, where\r\n     he was residing, he passed over to New Spain, in 1735, on some\r\n     business of the Countess of Santibañez, a lineal descendant of\r\n     Montezuma. While employed on this, he visited the celebrated shrine\r\n     of Our Lady of Guadaloupe, and, being a person of devout and\r\n     enthusiastic temper, was filled with the desire of collecting\r\n     testimony to establish the marvellous fact of her apparition. In\r\n     the course of his excursions, made with this view, he fell in with\r\n     many relics of Aztec antiquity, and conceived--what to a\r\n     Protestant, at least, would seem much more rational--the idea of\r\n     gathering together all the memorials he could meet with of the\r\n     primitive civilization of the land.\r\n\r\n     In pursuit of this double object, he penetrated into the remotest\r\n     parts of the country, living much with the natives, passing his\r\n     nights sometimes in their huts, sometimes in caves and the depths\r\n     of the lonely forests. Frequently months would elapse without his\r\n     being able to add anything to his collection; for the Indians had\r\n     suffered too much not to be very shy of Europeans. His long\r\n     intercourse with them, however, gave him ample opportunity to learn\r\n     their language and popular traditions, and, in the end, to amass a\r\n     large stock of materials, consisting of hieroglyphical charts on\r\n     cotton, skins, and the fibre of the maguey; besides a considerable\r\n     body of Indian manuscripts, written after the Conquest. To all\r\n     these must be added the precious documents for placing beyond\r\n     controversy the miraculous apparition of the Virgin. With this\r\n     treasure he returned, after a pilgrimage of eight years, to the\r\n     capital.\r\n\r\n     His zeal, in the mean while, had induced him to procure from Rome a\r\n     bull authorizing the coronation of the sacred image at Guadaloupe.\r\n     The bull, however, though sanctioned by the Audience of New Spain,\r\n     had never been approved by the Council of the Indies. In\r\n     consequence of this informality, Boturini was arrested in the midst\r\n     of his proceedings, his papers were taken from him, and, as he\r\n     declined to give an inventory of them, he was thrown into prison,\r\n     and confined in the same apartment with two criminals! Not long\r\n     afterward he was sent to Spain. He there presented a memorial to\r\n     the Council of the Indies, setting forth his manifold grievances,\r\n     and soliciting redress. At the same time, he drew up his “Idea,”\r\n     above noticed, in which he displayed the catalogue of his _museum_\r\n     in New Spain, declaring, with affecting earnestness, that “he would\r\n     not exchange these treasures for all the gold and silver, diamonds\r\n     and pearls, in the New World.”\r\n\r\n     After some delay, the Council gave an award in his favor;\r\n     acquitting him of any intentional violation of the law, and\r\n     pronouncing a high encomium on his deserts. His papers, however,\r\n     were not restored. But his Majesty was graciously pleased to\r\n     appoint him Historiographer-General of the Indies, with a salary of\r\n     one thousand dollars per annum. The stipend was too small to allow\r\n     him to return to Mexico. He remained in Madrid, and completed there\r\n     the first volume of a “General History of North America,” in 1749.\r\n     Not long after this event, and before the publication of the work,\r\n     he died. The same injustice was continued to his heirs; and,\r\n     notwithstanding repeated applications in their behalf, they were\r\n     neither put in possession of their unfortunate kinsman’s\r\n     collection, nor received a remuneration for it. What was worse,--as\r\n     far as the public was concerned,--the collection itself was\r\n     deposited in apartments of the vice-regal palace at Mexico, so damp\r\n     that they gradually fell to pieces, and the few remaining were\r\n     still further diminished by the pilfering of _the curious_. When\r\n     Baron Humboldt visited Mexico, not one-eighth of this inestimable\r\n     treasure was in existence!\r\n\r\n     I have been thus particular in the account of the unfortunate\r\n     Boturini, as affording, on the whole, the most remarkable example\r\n     of the serious obstacles and persecutions which literary\r\n     enterprise, directed in the path of the national antiquities, has,\r\n     from some cause or other, been exposed to in New Spain.\r\n\r\n     Boturini’s manuscript volume was never printed, and probably never\r\n     will be, if indeed it is in existence. This will scarcely prove a\r\n     great detriment to science or to his own reputation. He was a man\r\n     of a zealous temper, strongly inclined to the marvellous, with\r\n     little of that acuteness requisite for penetrating the tangled\r\n     mazes of antiquity, or of the philosophic spirit fitted for calmly\r\n     weighing its doubts and difficulties. His “Idea” affords a sample\r\n     of his peculiar mind. With abundant learning, ill assorted and ill\r\n     digested, it is a jumble of fact and puerile fiction, interesting\r\n     details, crazy dreams, and fantastic theories. But it is hardly\r\n     fair to judge by the strict rules of criticism a work which, put\r\n     together hastily, as a catalogue of literary treasures, was\r\n     designed by the author rather to show what might be done, than that\r\n     he could do it himself. It is rare that talents for action and\r\n     contemplation are united in the same individual. Boturini was\r\n     eminently qualified, by his enthusiasm and perseverance, for\r\n     collecting the materials necessary to illustrate the antiquities of\r\n     the country. It requires a more highly gifted mind to avail itself\r\n     of them.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VI[263]\r\n\r\n     THE TEZCUCANS--THEIR GOLDEN AGE--ACCOMPLISHED PRINCES--DECLINE OF\r\n     THEIR MONARCHY\r\n\r\n\r\nThe reader would gather but an imperfect notion of the civilization of\r\nAnahuac, without some account of the Acolhuans, or Tezcucans, as they\r\nare usually called; a nation of the same great family with the Aztecs,\r\nwhom they rivalled in power and surpassed in intellectual culture and\r\nthe arts of social refinement. Fortunately, we have ample materials for\r\nthis in the records left by Ixtlilxochitl, a lineal descendant of the\r\nroyal line of Tezcuco, who flourished in the century of the Conquest.\r\nWith every opportunity for information he combined much industry and\r\ntalent, and, if his narrative bears the high coloring of one who would\r\nrevive the faded glories of an ancient but dilapidated house, he has\r\nbeen uniformly commended for his fairness and integrity, and has been\r\nfollowed without misgiving by such Spanish writers as could have access\r\nto his manuscripts.[264] I shall confine myself to the prominent\r\nfeatures of the two reigns which may be said to embrace the golden age\r\nof Tezcuco, without attempting to weigh the probability of the details,\r\nwhich I will leave to be settled by the reader, according to the measure\r\nof his faith.\r\n\r\nThe Acolhuans came into the Valley, as we have seen, about the close of\r\nthe twelfth century, and built their capital of Tezcuco on the eastern\r\nborders of the lake, opposite to Mexico. From this point they gradually\r\nspread themselves over the northern portion of Anahuac, when their\r\ncareer was checked by an invasion of a kindred race, the Tepanecs, who,\r\nafter a desperate struggle, succeeded in taking their city, slaying\r\ntheir monarch, and entirely subjugating his kingdom.[265] This event\r\ntook place about 1418; and the young prince, Nezahualcoyotl, the heir to\r\nthe crown, then fifteen years old, saw his father butchered before his\r\neyes, while he himself lay concealed among the friendly branches of a\r\ntree which overshadowed the spot.[266] His subsequent history is as full\r\nof romantic daring and perilous escapes as that of the renowned\r\nScanderbeg or of the “young Chevalier.”[267]\r\n\r\nNot long after his flight from the field of his father’s blood, the\r\nTezcucan prince fell into the hands of his enemy, was borne off in\r\ntriumph to his city, and was thrown into a dungeon. He effected his\r\nescape, however, through the connivance of the governor of the fortress,\r\nan old servant of his family, who took the place of the royal fugitive,\r\nand paid for his loyalty with his life. He was at length permitted,\r\nthrough the intercession of the reigning family in Mexico, which was\r\nallied to him, to retire to that capital, and subsequently to his own,\r\nwhere he found a shelter in his ancestral palace. Here he remained\r\nunmolested for eight years, pursuing his studies under an old preceptor,\r\nwho had had the care of his early youth, and who instructed him in the\r\nvarious duties befitting his princely station.[268]\r\n\r\nAt the end of this period the Tepanec usurper died, bequeathing his\r\nempire to his son, Maxtla, a man of fierce and suspicious temper.\r\nNezahualcoyotl hastened to pay his obeisance to him, on his accession.\r\nBut the tyrant refused to receive the little present of flowers which he\r\nlaid at his feet, and turned his back on him in presence of his\r\nchieftains. One of his attendants, friendly to the young prince,\r\nadmonished him to provide for his own safety, by withdrawing, as\r\nspeedily as possible, from the palace, where his life was in danger. He\r\nlost no time, consequently, in retreating from the inhospitable court,\r\nand returned to Tezcuco. Maxtla, however, was bent on his destruction.\r\nHe saw with jealous eye the opening talents and popular manners of his\r\nrival, and the favor he was daily winning from his ancient\r\nsubjects.[269]\r\n\r\nHe accordingly laid a plan for making away with him at an evening\r\nentertainment. It was defeated by the vigilance of the prince’s tutor,\r\nwho contrived to mislead the assassins and to substitute another victim\r\nin the place of his pupil.[270] The baffled tyrant now threw off all\r\ndisguise, and sent a strong party of soldiers to Tezcuco, with orders to\r\nenter the palace, seize the person of Nezahualcoyotl, and slay him on\r\nthe spot. The prince, who became acquainted with the plot through the\r\nwatchfulness of his preceptor, instead of flying, as he was counselled,\r\nresolved to await his enemies. They found him playing at ball, when they\r\narrived, in the court of his palace. He received them courteously, and\r\ninvited them in, to take some refreshments after their journey. While\r\nthey were occupied in this way, he passed into an adjoining saloon,\r\nwhich excited no suspicion, as he was still visible through the open\r\ndoors by which the apartments communicated with each other. A burning\r\ncenser stood in the passage, and, as it was fed by the attendants, threw\r\nup such clouds of incense as obscured his movements from the soldiers.\r\nUnder this friendly veil he succeeded in making his escape by a secret\r\npassage, which communicated with a large earthen pipe formerly used to\r\nbring water to the palace.[271] Here he remained till nightfall, when,\r\ntaking advantage of the obscurity, he found his way into the suburbs,\r\nand sought a shelter in the cottage of one of his father’s vassals.\r\n\r\nThe Tepanec monarch, enraged at this repeated disappointment, ordered\r\ninstant pursuit. A price was set on the head of the royal fugitive.\r\nWhoever should take him, dead or alive, was promised, however humble his\r\ndegree, the hand of a noble lady, and an ample domain along with it.\r\nTroops of armed men were ordered to scour the country in every\r\ndirection. In the course of the search, the cottage in which the prince\r\nhad taken refuge was entered. But he fortunately escaped detection by\r\nbeing hid under a heap of maguey fibres used for manufacturing cloth. As\r\nthis was no longer a proper place of concealment, he sought a retreat in\r\nthe mountainous and woody district lying between the borders of his own\r\nstate and Tlascala.[272]\r\n\r\nHere he led a wretched, wandering life, exposed to all the inclemencies\r\nof the weather, hiding himself in deep thickets and caverns, and\r\nstealing out, at night, to satisfy the cravings of appetite; while he\r\nwas kept in constant alarm by the activity of his pursuers, always\r\nhovering on his track. On one occasion he sought refuge from them among\r\na small party of soldiers, who proved friendly to him and concealed him\r\nin a large drum around which they were dancing. At another time he was\r\njust able to turn the crest of a hill as his enemies were climbing it on\r\nthe other side, when he fell in with a girl who was reaping _chia_,--a\r\nMexican plant, the seed of which was much used in the drinks of the\r\ncountry. He persuaded her to cover him up with the stalks she had been\r\ncutting. When his pursuers came up, and inquired if she had seen the\r\nfugitive, the girl coolly answered that she had, and pointed out a path\r\nas the one he had taken. Notwithstanding the high rewards offered,\r\nNezahualcoyotl seems to have incurred no danger from treachery, such was\r\nthe general attachment felt to himself and his house. “Would you not\r\ndeliver up the prince, if he came in your way?” he inquired of a young\r\npeasant who was unacquainted with his person. “Not I,” replied the\r\nother. “What, not for a fair lady’s hand, and a rich dowry beside?”\r\nrejoined the prince. At which the other only shook his head and\r\nlaughed.[273] On more than one occasion his faithful people submitted to\r\ntorture, and even to lose their lives, rather than disclose the place of\r\nhis retreat.[274]\r\n\r\nHowever gratifying such proofs of loyalty might be to his feelings, the\r\nsituation of the prince in these mountain solitudes became every day\r\nmore distressing. It gave a still keener edge to his own sufferings to\r\nwitness those of the faithful followers who chose to accompany him in\r\nhis wanderings. “Leave me,” he would say to them, “to my fate! Why\r\nshould you throw away your own lives for one whom fortune is never weary\r\nof persecuting?” Most of the great Tezcucan chiefs had consulted their\r\ninterests by a timely adhesion to the usurper. But some still clung to\r\ntheir prince, preferring proscription, and death itself, rather than\r\ndesert him in his extremity.[275]\r\n\r\nIn the mean time, his friends at a distance were active in measures for\r\nhis relief. The oppressions of Maxtla, and his growing empire, had\r\ncaused general alarm in the surrounding states, who recalled the mild\r\nrule of the Tezcucan princes. A coalition was formed, a plan of\r\noperations concerted, and, on the day appointed for a general rising,\r\nNezahualcoyotl found himself at the head of a force sufficiently strong\r\nto face his Tepanec adversaries. An engagement came on, in which the\r\nlatter were totally discomfited; and the victorious prince, receiving\r\neverywhere on his route the homage of his joyful subjects, entered his\r\ncapital, not like a proscribed outcast, but as the rightful heir, and\r\nsaw himself once more enthroned in the halls of his fathers.\r\n\r\nSoon after, he united his forces with the Mexicans, long disgusted with\r\nthe arbitrary conduct of Maxtla. The allied powers, after a series of\r\nbloody engagements with the usurper, routed him under the walls of his\r\nown capital. He fled to the baths, whence he was dragged out, and\r\nsacrificed with the usual cruel ceremonies of the Aztecs; the royal city\r\nof Azcapozalco was razed to the ground, and the wasted territory was\r\nhenceforth reserved as the great slave-market for the nations of\r\nAnahuac.[276]\r\n\r\nThese events were succeeded by the remarkable league among the three\r\npowers of Tezcuco, Mexico, and Tlacopan, of which some account has been\r\ngiven in a previous chapter.[277] Historians are not agreed as to the\r\nprecise terms of it; the writers of the two former nations each\r\ninsisting on the paramount authority of his own in the coalition. All\r\nagree in the subordinate position of Tlacopan, a state, like the others,\r\nbordering on the lake. It is certain that in their subsequent\r\noperations, whether of peace or war, the three states shared in each\r\nother’s councils, embarked in each other’s enterprises, and moved in\r\nperfect concert together, till just before the coming of the Spaniards.\r\n\r\nThe first measure of Nezahualcoyotl, on returning to his dominions, was\r\na general amnesty. It was his maxim “that a monarch might punish, but\r\nrevenge was unworthy of him.”[278] In the present instance he was averse\r\neven to punish, and not only freely pardoned his rebel nobles, but\r\nconferred on some, who had most deeply offended, posts of honor and\r\nconfidence. Such conduct was doubtless politic, especially as their\r\nalienation was owing, probably, much more to fear of the usurper than to\r\nany disaffection towards himself. But there are some acts of policy\r\nwhich a magnanimous spirit only can execute.\r\n\r\nThe restored monarch next set about repairing the damages sustained\r\nunder the late misrule, and reviving, or rather remodelling, the various\r\ndepartments of government. He framed a concise, but comprehensive, code\r\nof laws, so well suited, it was thought, to the exigencies of the times,\r\nthat it was adopted as their own by the two other members of the triple\r\nalliance. It was written in blood, and entitled the author to be called\r\nthe Draco rather than “the Solon of Anahuac,” as he is fondly styled by\r\nhis admirers.[279] Humanity is one of the best fruits of refinement. It\r\nis only with increasing civilization that the legislator studies to\r\neconomize human suffering, even for the guilty; to devise penalties not\r\nso much by way of punishment for the past as of reformation for the\r\nfuture.[280]\r\n\r\nHe divided the burden of government among a number of departments, as\r\nthe council of war, the council of finance, the council of justice. This\r\nlast was a court of supreme authority, both in civil and criminal\r\nmatters, receiving appeals from the lower tribunals of the provinces,\r\nwhich were obliged to make a full report, every four months, or eighty\r\ndays, of their own proceedings to this higher judicature. In all these\r\nbodies, a certain number of citizens were allowed to have seats with the\r\nnobles and professional dignitaries. There was, however, another body, a\r\ncouncil of state, for aiding the king in the despatch of business, and\r\nadvising him in matters of importance, which was drawn altogether from\r\nthe highest order of chiefs. It consisted of fourteen members; and they\r\nhad seats provided for them at the royal table.[281]\r\n\r\nLastly, there was an extraordinary tribunal, called the council of\r\nmusic, but which, differing from the import of its name, was devoted to\r\nthe encouragement of science and art. Works on astronomy, chronology,\r\nhistory, or any other science, were required to be submitted to its\r\njudgment, before they could be made public. This censorial power was of\r\nsome moment, at least with regard to the historical department, where\r\nthe wilful perversion of truth was made a capital offence by the bloody\r\ncode of Nezahualcoyotl. Yet a Tezcucan author must have been a bungler,\r\nwho could not elude a conviction under the cloudy veil of hieroglyphics.\r\nThis body, which was drawn from the best-instructed persons in the\r\nkingdom, with little regard to rank, had supervision of all the\r\nproductions of art, and of the nicer fabrics. It decided on the\r\nqualifications of the professors in the various branches of science, on\r\nthe fidelity of their instructions to their pupils, the deficiency of\r\nwhich was severely punished, and it instituted examinations of these\r\nlatter. In short, it was a general board of education for the country.\r\nOn stated days, historical compositions, and poems treating of moral or\r\ntraditional topics, were recited before it by their authors. Seats were\r\nprovided for the three crowned heads of the empire, who deliberated with\r\nthe other members on the respective merits of the pieces, and\r\ndistributed prizes of value to the successful competitors.[282]\r\n\r\nSuch are the marvellous accounts transmitted to us of this institution;\r\nan institution certainly not to have been expected among the aborigines\r\nof America. It is calculated to give us a higher idea of the refinement\r\nof the people than even the noble architectural remains which still\r\ncover some parts of the continent. Architecture is, to a certain extent,\r\na sensual gratification. It addresses itself to the eye, and affords the\r\nbest scope for the parade of barbaric pomp and splendor. It is the form\r\nin which the revenues of a semi-civilized people are most likely to be\r\nlavished. The most gaudy and ostentatious specimens of it, and sometimes\r\nthe most stupendous, have been reared by such hands. It is one of the\r\nfirst steps in the great march of civilization. But the institution in\r\nquestion was evidence of still higher refinement. It was a literary\r\nluxury, and argued the existence of a taste in the nation which relied\r\nfor its gratification on pleasures of a purely intellectual character.\r\n\r\nThe influence of this academy must have been most propitious to the\r\ncapital, which became the nursery not only of such sciences as could be\r\ncompassed by the scholarship of the period, but of various useful and\r\nornamental arts. Its historians, orators, and poets were celebrated\r\nthroughout the country.[283] Its archives, for which accommodations were\r\nprovided in the royal palace, were stored with the records of primitive\r\nages.[284] Its idiom, more polished than the Mexican, was, indeed, the\r\npurest of all the Nahuatlac dialects, and continued, long after the\r\nConquest, to be that in which the best productions of the native races\r\nwere composed. Tezcuco claimed the glory of being the Athens of the\r\nWestern world.[285]\r\n\r\nAmong the most illustrious of her bards was the emperor himself,--for\r\nthe Tezcucan writers claim this title for their chief, as head of the\r\nimperial alliance. He doubtless appeared as a competitor before that\r\nvery academy where he so often sat as a critic. Many of his odes\r\ndescended to a late generation, and are still preserved, perhaps, in\r\nsome of the dusty repositories of Mexico or Spain.[286] The historian\r\nIxtlilxochitl has left a translation, in Castilian, of one of the poems\r\nof his royal ancestor. It is not easy to render his version into\r\ncorresponding English rhyme, without the perfume of the original\r\nescaping in this double filtration.[287] They remind one of the rich\r\nbreathings of Spanish-Arab poetry, in which an ardent imagination is\r\ntempered by a not unpleasing and moral melancholy.[288] But, though\r\nsufficiently florid in diction, they are generally free from the\r\nmeretricious ornaments and hyperbole with which the minstrelsy of the\r\nEast is usually tainted. They turn on the vanities and mutability of\r\nhuman life,--a topic very natural for a monarch who had himself\r\nexperienced the strangest mutations of fortune. There is mingled in the\r\nlament of the Tezcucan bard, however, an Epicurean philosophy, which\r\nseeks relief from the fears of the future in the joys of the present.\r\n“Banish care,” he says: “if there are bounds to pleasure, the saddest\r\nlife must also have an end. Then weave the chaplet of flowers, and sing\r\nthy songs in praise of the all-powerful God, for the glory of this world\r\nsoon fadeth away. Rejoice in the green freshness of thy spring; for the\r\nday will come when thou shalt sigh for these joys in vain; when the\r\nsceptre shall pass from thy hands, thy servants shall wander desolate in\r\nthy courts, thy sons, and the sons of thy nobles, shall drink the dregs\r\nof distress, and all the pomp of thy victories and triumphs shall live\r\nonly in their recollection. Yet the remembrance of the just shall not\r\npass away from the nations, and the good thou hast done shall ever be\r\nheld in honor. The goods of this life, its glories and its riches, are\r\nbut lent to us, its substance is but an illusory shadow, and the things\r\nof to-day shall change on the coming of the morrow. Then gather the\r\nfairest flowers from thy gardens, to bind round thy brow, and seize the\r\njoys of the present ere they perish.”[289]\r\n\r\nBut the hours of the Tezcucan monarch were not all passed in idle\r\ndalliance with the Muse, nor in the sober contemplations of philosophy,\r\nas at a later period. In the freshness of youth and early manhood he led\r\nthe allied armies in their annual expeditions, which were certain to\r\nresult in a wider extent of territory to the empire.[290] In the\r\nintervals of peace he fostered those productive arts which are the\r\nsurest sources of public prosperity. He encouraged agriculture above\r\nall; and there was scarcely a spot so rude, or a steep so inaccessible,\r\nas not to confess the power of cultivation. The land was covered with a\r\nbusy population, and towns and cities sprang up in places since deserted\r\nor dwindled into miserable villages.[291]\r\n\r\nFrom resources thus enlarged by conquest and domestic industry, the\r\nmonarch drew the means for the large consumption of his own numerous\r\nhousehold,[292] and for the costly works which he executed for the\r\nconvenience and embellishment of the capital. He filled it with stately\r\nedifices for his nobles, whose constant attendance he was anxious to\r\nsecure at his court.[293] He erected a magnificent pile of buildings\r\nwhich might serve both for a royal residence and for the public\r\noffices. It extended, from east to west, twelve hundred and thirty-four\r\nyards, and from north to south, nine hundred and seventy-eight.[294] It\r\nwas encompassed by a wall of unburnt bricks and cement, six feet wide\r\nand nine high for one half of the circumference, and fifteen feet high\r\nfor the other half. Within this enclosure were two courts. The outer one\r\nwas used as the great market-place of the city, and continued to be so\r\nuntil long after the Conquest,--if, indeed, it is not now. The interior\r\ncourt was surrounded by the council-chambers and halls of justice. There\r\nwere also accommodations there for the foreign ambassadors; and a\r\nspacious saloon, with apartments opening into it, for men of science and\r\npoets, who pursued their studies in this retreat or met together to hold\r\nconverse under its marble porticoes. In this quarter, also, were kept\r\nthe public archives, which fared better under the Indian dynasty than\r\nthey have since under their European successors.[295]\r\n\r\nAdjoining this court were the apartments of the king, including those\r\nfor the royal harem, as liberally supplied with beauties as that of an\r\nEastern sultan. Their walls were incrusted with alabasters and\r\nrichly-tinted stucco, or hung with gorgeous tapestries of variegated\r\nfeather-work.[296] They led through long arcades, and through intricate\r\nlabyrinths of shrubbery, into gardens where baths and sparkling\r\nfountains were overshadowed by tall groves of cedar and cypress. The\r\nbasins of water were well stocked with fish of various kinds, and the\r\naviaries with birds glowing in all the gaudy plumage of the tropics.\r\nMany birds and animals which could not be obtained alive were\r\nrepresented in gold and silver so skilfully as to have furnished the\r\ngreat naturalist Hernandez with models for his work.[297]\r\n\r\nAccommodations on a princely scale were provided for the sovereigns of\r\nMexico and Tlacopan when they visited the court. The whole of this\r\nlordly pile contained three hundred apartments, some of them fifty yards\r\nsquare.[298] The height of the building is not mentioned. It was\r\nprobably not great, but supplied the requisite room by the immense\r\nextent of ground which it covered. The interior was doubtless\r\nconstructed of light materials, especially of the rich woods which, in\r\nthat country, are remarkable, when polished, for the brilliancy and\r\nvariety of their colors. That the more solid materials of stone and\r\nstucco were also liberally employed is proved by the remains at the\r\npresent day; remains which have furnished an inexhaustible quarry for\r\nthe churches and other edifices since erected by the Spaniards on the\r\nsite of the ancient city.[299]\r\n\r\nWe are not informed of the time occupied in building this palace. But\r\ntwo hundred thousand workmen, it is said, were employed on it.[300]\r\nHowever this may be, it is certain that the Tezcucan monarchs, like\r\nthose of Asia and ancient Egypt, had the control of immense masses of\r\nmen, and would sometimes turn the whole population of a conquered city,\r\nincluding the women, into the public works.[301] The most gigantic\r\nmonuments of architecture which the world has witnessed would never have\r\nbeen reared by the hands of freemen.\r\n\r\nAdjoining the palace were buildings for the king’s children, who, by his\r\nvarious wives, amounted to no less than sixty sons and fifty\r\ndaughters.[302] Here they were instructed in all the exercises and\r\naccomplishments suited to their station; comprehending, what would\r\nscarcely find a place in a royal education on the other side of the\r\nAtlantic, the arts of working in metals, jewelry, and feather-mosaic.\r\nOnce in every four months, the whole household, not excepting the\r\nyoungest, and including all the officers and attendants on the king’s\r\nperson, assembled in a grand saloon of the palace, to listen to a\r\ndiscourse from an orator, probably one of the priesthood. The princes,\r\non this occasion, were all dressed in _nequen_, the coarsest manufacture\r\nof the country. The preacher began by enlarging on the obligations of\r\nmorality and of respect for the gods, especially important in persons\r\nwhose rank gave such additional weight to example. He occasionally\r\nseasoned his homily with a pertinent application to his audience, if any\r\nmember of it had been guilty of a notorious delinquency. From this\r\nwholesome admonition the monarch himself was not exempted, and the\r\norator boldly reminded him of his paramount duty to show respect for his\r\nown laws. The king, so far from taking umbrage, received the lesson with\r\nhumility; and the audience, we are assured, were often melted into tears\r\nby the eloquence of the preacher.[303] This curious scene may remind one\r\nof similar usages in the Asiatic and Egyptian despotisms, where the\r\nsovereign occasionally condescended to stoop from his pride of place and\r\nallow his memory to be refreshed with the conviction of his own\r\nmortality.[304] It soothed the feelings of the subject to find himself\r\nthus placed, though but for a moment, on a level with his king; while it\r\ncost little to the latter, who was removed too far from his people to\r\nsuffer anything by this short-lived familiarity. It is probable that\r\nsuch an act of public humiliation would have found less favor with a\r\nprince less absolute.\r\n\r\nNezahualcoyotl’s fondness for magnificence was shown in his numerous\r\nvillas, which were embellished with all that could make a rural retreat\r\ndelightful. His favorite residence was at Tezcotzinco, a conical hill\r\nabout two leagues from the capital.[305] It was laid out in terraces, or\r\nhanging gardens, having a flight of steps five hundred and twenty in\r\nnumber, many of them hewn in the natural porphyry.[306] In the garden on\r\nthe summit was a reservoir of water, fed by an aqueduct that was carried\r\nover hill and valley, for several miles, on huge buttresses of masonry.\r\nA large rock stood in the midst of this basin, sculptured with the\r\nhieroglyphics representing the years of Nezahualcoyotl’s reign and his\r\nprincipal achievements in each.[307] On a lower level were three other\r\nreservoirs, in each of which stood a marble statue of a woman,\r\nemblematic of the three states of the empire.[308] Another tank\r\ncontained a winged lion, (?) cut out of the solid rock, bearing in its\r\nmouth the portrait of the emperor.[309] His likeness had been executed\r\nin gold, wood, feather-work, and stone; but this was the only one which\r\npleased him.\r\n\r\nFrom these copious basins the water was distributed in numerous channels\r\nthrough the gardens, or was made to tumble over the rocks in cascades,\r\nshedding refreshing dews on the flowers and odoriferous shrubs below. In\r\nthe depths of this fragrant wilderness, marble porticoes and pavilions\r\nwere erected, and baths excavated in the solid porphyry, which are still\r\nshown by the ignorant natives as the “Baths of Montezuma”![310] The\r\nvisitor descended by steps cut in the living stone and polished so\r\nbright as to reflect like mirrors.[311] Towards the base of the hill, in\r\nthe midst of cedar groves, whose gigantic branches threw a refreshing\r\ncoolness over the verdure in the sultriest seasons of the year,[312]\r\nrose the royal villa, with its light arcades and airy halls, drinking\r\nin the sweet perfumes of the gardens. Here the monarch often retired, to\r\nthrow off the burden of state and refresh his wearied spirits in the\r\nsociety of his favorite wives, reposing during the noontide heats in the\r\nembowering shades of his paradise, or mingling, in the cool of the\r\nevening, in their festive sports and dances. Here he entertained his\r\nimperial brothers of Mexico and Tlacopan, and followed the hardier\r\npleasures of the chase in the noble woods that stretched for miles\r\naround his villa, flourishing in all their primeval majesty. Here, too,\r\nhe often repaired in the latter days of his life, when age had tempered\r\nambition and cooled the ardor of his blood, to pursue in solitude the\r\nstudies of philosophy and gather wisdom from meditation.\r\n\r\nThe extraordinary accounts of the Tezcucan architecture are confirmed,\r\nin the main, by the relics which still cover the hill of Tezcotzinco or\r\nare half buried beneath its surface. They attract little attention,\r\nindeed, in the country, where their true history has long since passed\r\ninto oblivion;[313] while the traveller whose curiosity leads him to the\r\nspot speculates on their probable origin, and, as he stumbles over the\r\nhuge fragments of sculptured porphyry and granite, refers them to the\r\nprimitive races who spread their colossal architecture over the country\r\nlong before the coming of the Acolhuans and the Aztecs.[314]\r\n\r\nThe Tezcucan princes were used to entertain a great number of\r\nconcubines. They had but one lawful wife, to whose issue the crown\r\ndescended.[315] Nezahualcoyotl remained unmarried to a late period. He\r\nwas disappointed in an early attachment, as the princess who had been\r\neducated in privacy to be the partner of his throne gave her hand to\r\nanother. The injured monarch submitted the affair to the proper\r\ntribunal. The parties, however, were proved to have been ignorant of the\r\ndestination of the lady, and the court, with an independence which\r\nreflects equal honor on the judges who could give and the monarch who\r\ncould receive the sentence, acquitted the young couple. This story is\r\nsadly contrasted by the following.[316]\r\n\r\nThe king devoured his chagrin in the solitude of his beautiful villa of\r\nTezcotzinco, or sought to divert it by travelling. On one of his\r\njourneys he was hospitably entertained by a potent vassal, the old lord\r\nof Tepechpan, who, to do his sovereign more honor, caused him to be\r\nattended at the banquet by a noble maiden, betrothed to himself, and\r\nwho, after the fashion of the country, had been educated under his own\r\nroof. She was of the blood royal of Mexico, and nearly related,\r\nmoreover, to the Tezcucan monarch. The latter, who had all the amorous\r\ntemperament of the South, was captivated by the grace and personal\r\ncharms of the youthful Hebe, and conceived a violent passion for her. He\r\ndid not disclose it to any one, however, but, on his return home,\r\nresolved to gratify it, though at the expense of his own honor, by\r\nsweeping away the only obstacle which stood in his path.\r\n\r\nHe accordingly sent an order to the chief of Tepechpan to take command\r\nof an expedition set on foot against the Tlascalans. At the same time he\r\ninstructed two Tezcucan chiefs to keep near the person of the old lord,\r\nand bring him into the thickest of the fight, where he might lose his\r\nlife. He assured them this had been forfeited by a great crime, but\r\nthat, from regard for his vassal’s past services, he was willing to\r\ncover up his disgrace by an honorable death.\r\n\r\nThe veteran, who had long lived in retirement on his estates, saw\r\nhimself with astonishment called so suddenly and needlessly into action,\r\nfor which so many younger men were better fitted. He suspected the\r\ncause, and, in the farewell entertainment to his friends, uttered a\r\npresentiment of his sad destiny. His predictions were too soon\r\nverified; and a few weeks placed the hand of his virgin bride at her\r\nown disposal.\r\n\r\nNezahualcoyotl did not think it prudent to break his passion publicly to\r\nthe princess so soon after the death of his victim. He opened a\r\ncorrespondence with her through a female relative, and expressed his\r\ndeep sympathy for her loss. At the same time, he tendered the best\r\nconsolation in his power, by an offer of his heart and hand. Her former\r\nlover had been too well stricken in years for the maiden to remain long\r\ninconsolable. She was not aware of the perfidious plot against his life;\r\nand, after a decent time, she was ready to comply with her duty, by\r\nplacing herself at the disposal of her royal kinsman.\r\n\r\nIt was arranged by the king, in order to give a more natural aspect to\r\nthe affair and prevent all suspicion of the unworthy part he had acted,\r\nthat the princess should present herself in his grounds at Tezcotzinco,\r\nto witness some public ceremony there. Nezahualcoyotl was standing in a\r\nbalcony of the palace when she appeared, and inquired, as if struck with\r\nher beauty for the first time, “who the lovely young creature was, in\r\nhis gardens.” When his courtiers had acquainted him with her name and\r\nrank, he ordered her to be conducted to the palace, that she might\r\nreceive the attentions due to her station. The interview was soon\r\nfollowed by a public declaration of his passion; and the marriage was\r\ncelebrated not long after, with great pomp, in the presence of his\r\ncourt, and of his brother monarchs of Mexico and Tlacopan.[317]\r\n\r\nThis story, which furnishes so obvious a counterpart to that of David\r\nand Uriah, is told with great circumstantiality, both by the king’s son\r\nand grandson, from whose narratives Ixtlilxochitl derived it.[318] They\r\nstigmatize the action as the basest in their great ancestor’s life. It\r\nis indeed too base not to leave an indelible stain on any character,\r\nhowever pure in other respects, and exalted.\r\n\r\nThe king was strict in the execution of his laws, though his natural\r\ndisposition led him to temper justice with mercy. Many anecdotes are\r\ntold of the benevolent interest he took in the concerns of his subjects,\r\nand of his anxiety to detect and reward merit, even in the most humble.\r\nIt was common for him to ramble among them in disguise, like the\r\ncelebrated caliph in the “Arabian Nights,” mingling freely in\r\nconversation, and ascertaining their actual condition with his own\r\neyes.[319]\r\n\r\nOn one such occasion, when attended only by a single lord, he met with a\r\nboy who was gathering sticks in a field for fuel. He inquired of him\r\n“why he did not go into the neighboring forest, where he would find a\r\nplenty of them.” To which the lad answered, “It was the king’s wood, and\r\nhe would punish him with death if he trespassed there.” The royal\r\nforests were very extensive in Tezcuco, and were guarded by laws full as\r\nsevere as those of the Norman tyrants in England. “What kind of man is\r\nyour king?” asked the monarch, willing to learn the effect of these\r\nprohibitions on his own popularity. “A very hard man,” answered the boy,\r\n“who denies his people what God has given them.”[320] Nezahualcoyotl\r\nurged him not to mind such arbitrary laws, but to glean his sticks in\r\nthe forest, as there was no one present who would betray him. But the\r\nboy sturdily refused, bluntly accusing the disguised king, at the same\r\ntime, of being a traitor, and of wishing to bring him into trouble.\r\n\r\nNezahualcoyotl, on returning to the palace, ordered the child and his\r\nparents to be summoned before him. They received the orders with\r\nastonishment, but, on entering the presence, the boy at once recognized\r\nthe person with whom he had discoursed so unceremoniously, and he was\r\nfilled with consternation. The good-natured monarch, however, relieved\r\nhis apprehensions, by thanking him for the lesson he had given him, and,\r\nat the same time, commended his respect for the laws, and praised his\r\nparents for the manner in which they had trained their son. He then\r\ndismissed the parties with a liberal largess, and afterwards mitigated\r\nthe severity of the forest laws, so as to allow persons to gather any\r\nwood they might find on the ground, if they did not meddle with the\r\nstanding timber.[321]\r\n\r\nAnother adventure is told of him, with a poor woodman and his wife, who\r\nhad brought their little load of billets for sale to the market-place of\r\nTezcuco. The man was bitterly lamenting his hard lot, and the\r\ndifficulty with which he earned a wretched subsistence, while the master\r\nof the palace before which they were standing lived an idle life,\r\nwithout toil, and with all the luxuries in the world at his command.\r\n\r\nHe was going on in his complaints, when the good woman stopped him, by\r\nreminding him he might be overheard. He was so, by Nezahualcoyotl\r\nhimself who, standing screened from observation at a latticed window\r\nwhich overlooked the market, was amusing himself, as he was wont, with\r\nobserving the common people chaffering in the square. He immediately\r\nordered the querulous couple into his presence. They appeared trembling\r\nand conscience-struck before him. The king gravely inquired what they\r\nhad said. As they answered him truly, he told them they should reflect\r\nthat, if he had great treasures at his command, he had still greater\r\ncalls for them; that, far from leading an easy life, he was oppressed\r\nwith the whole burden of government; and concluded by admonishing them\r\n“to be more cautious in future, as walls had ears.”[322] He then ordered\r\nhis officers to bring a quantity of cloth and a generous supply of cacao\r\n(the coin of the country), and dismissed them. “Go,” said he; “with the\r\nlittle you now have, you will be rich; while, with all my riches, I\r\nshall still be poor.”[323]\r\n\r\nIt was not his passion to hoard. He dispensed his revenues\r\nmunificently, seeking out poor but meritorious objects on whom to bestow\r\nthem. He was particularly mindful of disabled soldiers, and those who\r\nhad in any way sustained loss in the public service, and, in case of\r\ntheir death, extended assistance to their surviving families. Open\r\nmendicity was a thing he would never tolerate, but chastised it with\r\nexemplary rigor.[324]\r\n\r\nIt would be incredible that a man of the enlarged mind and endowments of\r\nNezahualcoyotl should acquiesce in the sordid superstitions of his\r\ncountrymen, and still more in the sanguinary rites borrowed by them from\r\nthe Aztecs. In truth, his humane temper shrunk from these cruel\r\nceremonies, and he strenuously endeavored to recall his people to the\r\nmore pure and simple worship of the ancient Toltecs. A circumstance\r\nproduced a temporary change in his conduct.\r\n\r\nHe had been married some years to the wife he had so unrighteously\r\nobtained, but was not blessed with issue. The priests represented that\r\nit was owing to his neglect of the gods of his country, and that his\r\nonly remedy was to propitiate them by human sacrifice. The king\r\nreluctantly consented, and the altars once more smoked with the blood of\r\nslaughtered captives. But it was all in vain; and he indignantly\r\nexclaimed, “These idols of wood and stone can neither hear nor feel;\r\nmuch less could they make the heavens, and the earth, and man, the lord\r\nof it. These must be the work of the all-powerful, unknown God, Creator\r\nof the universe, on whom alone I must rely for consolation and\r\nsupport.”[325]\r\n\r\nHe then withdrew to his rural palace of Tezcotzinco, where he remained\r\nforty days, fasting and praying at stated hours, and offering up no\r\nother sacrifice than the sweet incense of copal, and aromatic herbs and\r\ngums. At the expiration of this time, he is said to have been comforted\r\nby a vision assuring him of the success of his petition. At all events,\r\nsuch proved to be the fact; and this was followed by the cheering\r\nintelligence of the triumph of his arms in a quarter where he had lately\r\nexperienced some humiliating reverses.[326]\r\n\r\nGreatly strengthened in his former religious convictions, he now openly\r\nprofessed his faith, and was more earnest to wean his subjects from\r\ntheir degrading superstitions and to substitute nobler and more\r\nspiritual conceptions of the Deity. He built a temple in the usual\r\npyramidal form, and on the summit a tower nine stories high, to\r\nrepresent the nine heavens; a tenth was surmounted by a roof painted\r\nblack, and profusely gilded with stars, on the outside, and incrusted\r\nwith metals and precious stones within. He dedicated this to “_the\r\nunknown God, the Cause of causes_”[327] It seems probable, from the\r\nemblem on the tower, as well as from the complexion of his verses, as we\r\nshall see, that he mingled with his reverence for the Supreme the astral\r\nworship which existed among the Toltecs.[328] Various musical\r\ninstruments were placed on the top of the tower, and the sound of them,\r\naccompanied by the ringing of a sonorous metal struck by a mallet,\r\nsummoned the worshippers to prayers, at regular seasons.[329] No image\r\nwas allowed in the edifice, as unsuited to the “invisible God;” and the\r\npeople were expressly prohibited from profaning the altars with blood,\r\nor any other sacrifices than that of the perfume of flowers and\r\nsweet-scented gums.\r\n\r\nThe remainder of his days was chiefly spent in his delicious solitudes\r\nof Tezcotzinco, where he devoted himself to astronomical and, probably,\r\nastrological studies, and to meditation on his immortal destiny,--giving\r\nutterance to his feelings in songs, or rather hymns, of much solemnity\r\nand pathos. An extract from one of these will convey some idea of his\r\nreligious speculations. The pensive tenderness of the verses quoted in a\r\npreceding page is deepened here into a mournful, and even gloomy,\r\ncoloring; while the wounded spirit, instead of seeking relief in the\r\nconvivial sallies of a young and buoyant temperament, turns for\r\nconsolation to the world beyond the grave:\r\n\r\n“All things on earth have their term, and, in the most joyous career of\r\ntheir vanity and splendor, their strength fails, and they sink into the\r\ndust. All the round world is but a sepulchre; and there is nothing which\r\nlives on its surface that shall not be hidden and entombed beneath it.\r\nRivers, torrents, and streams move onward to their destination. Not one\r\nflows back to its pleasant source. They rush onward, hastening to bury\r\nthemselves in the deep bosom of the ocean. The things of yesterday are\r\nno more to-day; and the things of to-day shall cease, perhaps, on the\r\nmorrow.[330] The cemetery is full of the loathsome dust of bodies, once\r\nquickened by living souls, who occupied thrones, presided over\r\nassemblies, marshalled armies, subdued provinces, arrogated to\r\nthemselves worship, were puffed up with vainglorious pomp, and power,\r\nand empire.\r\n\r\n“But these glories have all passed away, like the fearful smoke that\r\nissues from the throat of Popocatepetl, with no other memorial of their\r\nexistence than the record on the page of the chronicler.\r\n\r\n“The great, the wise, the valiant, the beautiful,--alas! where are they\r\nnow? They are all mingled with the clod; and that which has befallen\r\nthem shall happen to us, and to those that come after us. Yet let us\r\ntake courage, illustrious nobles and chieftains, true friends and loyal\r\nsubjects,--_let us aspire to that heaven where all is eternal and\r\ncorruption cannot come_.[331] The horrors of the tomb are but the cradle\r\nof the Sun, and the dark shadows of death are brilliant lights for the\r\nstars.”[332] The mystic import of the last sentence seems to point to\r\nthat superstition respecting the mansions of the Sun, which forms so\r\nbeautiful a contrast to the dark features of the Aztec mythology.\r\n\r\nAt length, about the year 1470,[333] Nezahualcoyotl, full of years and\r\nhonors, felt himself drawing near his end. Almost half a century had\r\nelapsed since he mounted the throne of Tezcuco. He had found his kingdom\r\ndismembered by faction and bowed to the dust beneath the yoke of a\r\nforeign tyrant. He had broken that yoke; had breathed new life into the\r\nnation, renewed its ancient institutions, extended wide its domain; had\r\nseen it flourishing in all the activity of trade and agriculture,\r\ngathering strength from its enlarged resources, and daily advancing\r\nhigher and higher in the great march of civilization. All this he had\r\nseen, and might fairly attribute no small portion of it to his own wise\r\nand beneficent rule. His long and glorious day was now drawing to its\r\nclose; and he contemplated the event with the same serenity which he had\r\nshown under the clouds of its morning and in its meridian splendor.\r\n\r\nA short time before his death, he gathered around him those of his\r\nchildren in whom he most confided, his chief counsellors, the\r\nambassadors of Mexico and Tlacopan, and his little son, the heir to the\r\ncrown, his only offspring by the queen. He was then not eight years old,\r\nbut had already given, as far as so tender a blossom might, the rich\r\npromise of future excellence.[334]\r\n\r\nAfter tenderly embracing the child, the dying monarch threw over him the\r\nrobes of sovereignty. He then gave audience to the ambassadors, and,\r\nwhen they had retired, made the boy repeat the substance of the\r\nconversation. He followed this by such counsels as were suited to his\r\ncomprehension, and which, when remembered through the long vista of\r\nafter-years, would serve as lights to guide him in his government of the\r\nkingdom. He besought him not to neglect the worship of “the unknown\r\nGod,” regretting that he himself had been unworthy to know him, and\r\nintimating his conviction that the time would come when he should be\r\nknown and worshipped throughout the land.[335]\r\n\r\nHe next addressed himself to that one of his sons in whom he placed the\r\ngreatest trust, and whom he had selected as the guardian of the realm.\r\n“From this hour,” said he to him, “you will fill the place that I have\r\nfilled, of father to this child; you will teach him to live as he ought;\r\nand by your counsels he will rule over the empire. Stand in his place,\r\nand be his guide, till he shall be of age to govern for himself.” Then,\r\nturning to his other children, he admonished them to live united with\r\none another, and to show all loyalty to their prince, who, though a\r\nchild, already manifested a discretion far above his years. “Be true to\r\nhim,” he added, “and he will maintain you in your rights and\r\ndignities.”[336]\r\n\r\nFeeling his end approaching, he exclaimed, “Do not bewail me with idle\r\nlamentations. But sing the song of gladness, and show a courageous\r\nspirit, that the nations I have subdued may not believe you\r\ndisheartened, but may feel that each one of you is strong enough to keep\r\nthem in obedience!” The undaunted spirit of the monarch shone forth even\r\nin the agonies of death. That stout heart, however, melted, as he took\r\nleave of his children and friends, weeping tenderly over them, while he\r\nbade each a last adieu. When they had withdrawn, he ordered the officers\r\nof the palace to allow no one to enter it again. Soon after, he expired,\r\nin the seventy-second year of his age, and the forty-third of his\r\nreign.[337]\r\n\r\nThus died the greatest monarch, and, if one foul blot could be effaced,\r\nperhaps the best, who ever sat upon an Indian throne. His character is\r\ndelineated with tolerable impartiality by his kinsman, the Tezcucan\r\nchronicler: “He was wise, valiant, liberal; and, when we consider the\r\nmagnanimity of his soul, the grandeur and success of his enterprises,\r\nhis deep policy, as well as daring, we must admit him to have far\r\nsurpassed every other prince and captain of this New World. He had few\r\nfailings himself, and rigorously punished those of others. He preferred\r\nthe public to his private interest; was most charitable in his nature,\r\noften buying articles, at double their worth, of poor and honest\r\npersons, and giving them away again to the sick and infirm. In seasons\r\nof scarcity he was particularly bountiful, remitting the taxes of his\r\nvassals, and supplying their wants from the royal granaries. He put no\r\nfaith in the idolatrous worship of the country. He was well instructed\r\nin moral science, and sought, above all things, to obtain light for\r\nknowing the true God. He believed in one God only, the Creator of heaven\r\nand earth, by whom we have our being, who never revealed himself to us\r\nin human form, nor in any other; with whom the souls of the virtuous are\r\nto dwell after death, while the wicked will suffer pains unspeakable. He\r\ninvoked the Most High, as ‘He by whom we live,’ and ‘Who has all things\r\nin himself.’ He recognized the Sun for his father, and the Earth for his\r\nmother. He taught his children not to confide in idols, and only to\r\nconform to the outward worship of them from deference to public\r\nopinion.[338] If he could not entirely abolish human sacrifices, derived\r\nfrom the Aztecs, he at least restricted them to slaves and\r\ncaptives.”[339]\r\n\r\nI have occupied so much space with this illustrious prince that but\r\nlittle remains for his son and successor, Nezahualpilli. I have thought\r\nit better, in our narrow limits, to present a complete view of a single\r\nepoch, the most interesting in the Tezcucan annals, than to spread the\r\ninquiries over a broader but comparatively barren field. Yet\r\nNezahualpilli, the heir to the crown, was a remarkable person, and his\r\nreign contains many incidents which I regret to be obliged to pass over\r\nin silence.[340]\r\n\r\nHe had, in many respects, a taste similar to his father’s, and, like\r\nhim, displayed a profuse magnificence in his way of living and in his\r\npublic edifices. He was more severe in his morals, and, in the execution\r\nof justice, stern even to the sacrifice of natural affection. Several\r\nremarkable instances of this are told; one, among others, in relation to\r\nhis eldest son, the heir to the crown, a prince of great promise. The\r\nyoung man entered into a poetical correspondence with one of his\r\nfather’s concubines, the lady of Tula, as she was called, a woman of\r\nhumble origin, but of uncommon endowments. She wrote verses with ease,\r\nand could discuss graver matters with the king and his ministers. She\r\nmaintained a separate establishment, where she lived in state, and\r\nacquired, by her beauty and accomplishments, great ascendency over her\r\nroyal lover.[341] With this favorite the prince carried on a\r\ncorrespondence in verse,--whether of an amorous nature does not appear.\r\nAt all events, the offence was capital. It was submitted to the regular\r\ntribunal, who pronounced sentence of death on the unfortunate youth; and\r\nthe king, steeling his heart against all entreaties and the voice of\r\nnature, suffered the cruel judgment to be carried into execution. We\r\nmight, in this case, suspect the influence of baser passions on his\r\nmind, but it was not a solitary instance of his inexorable justice\r\ntowards those most near to him. He had the stern virtue of an ancient\r\nRoman, destitute of the softer graces which make virtue attractive. When\r\nthe sentence was carried into effect, he shut himself up in his palace\r\nfor many weeks, and commanded the doors and windows of his son’s\r\nresidence to be walled up, that it might never again be occupied.[342]\r\n\r\nNezahualpilli resembled his father in his passion for astronomical\r\nstudies, and is said to have had an observatory on one of his\r\npalaces.[343] He was devoted to war in his youth, but, as he advanced in\r\nyears, resigned himself to a more indolent way of life, and sought his\r\nchief amusement in the pursuit of his favorite science, or in the soft\r\npleasures of the sequestered gardens of Tezcotzinco. This quiet life was\r\nill suited to the turbulent temper of the times, and of his Mexican\r\nrival, Montezuma. The distant provinces fell off from their allegiance;\r\nthe army relaxed its discipline; disaffection crept into its ranks; and\r\nthe wily Montezuma, partly by violence, and partly by stratagems\r\nunworthy of a king, succeeded in plundering his brother monarch of some\r\nof his most valuable domains. Then it was that he arrogated to himself\r\nthe title and supremacy of emperor, hitherto borne by the Tezcucan\r\nprinces as head of the alliance. Such is the account given by the\r\nhistorians of that nation, who in this way explain the acknowledged\r\nsuperiority of the Aztec sovereign, both in territory and consideration,\r\non the landing of the Spaniards.[344]\r\n\r\nThese misfortunes pressed heavily on the spirits of Nezahualpilli. Their\r\neffect was increased by certain gloomy prognostics of a near calamity\r\nwhich was to overwhelm the country.[345] He withdrew to his retreat, to\r\nbrood in secret over his sorrows. His health rapidly declined; and in\r\nthe year 1515, at the age of fifty-two, he sank into the grave;[346]\r\nhappy, at least, that by this timely death he escaped witnessing the\r\nfulfilment of his own predictions, in the ruin of his country, and the\r\nextinction of the Indian dynasties forever.[347]\r\n\r\nIn reviewing the brief sketch here presented of the Tezcucan monarchy,\r\nwe are strongly impressed with the conviction of its superiority, in all\r\nthe great features of civilization, over the rest of Anahuac. The\r\nMexicans showed a similar proficiency, no doubt, in the mechanic arts,\r\nand even in mathematical science. But in the science of government, in\r\nlegislation, in speculative doctrines of a religious nature, in the more\r\nelegant pursuits of poetry, eloquence, and whatever depended on\r\nrefinement of taste and a polished idiom, they confessed themselves\r\ninferior, by resorting to their rivals for instruction and citing their\r\nworks as the masterpieces of their tongue. The best histories, the best\r\npoems, the best code of laws, the purest dialect, were all allowed to be\r\nTezcucan. The Aztecs rivalled their neighbors in splendor of living, and\r\neven in the magnificence of their structures. They displayed a pomp and\r\nostentatious pageantry truly Asiatic. But this was the development of\r\nthe material rather than the intellectual principle. They wanted the\r\nrefinement of manners essential to a continued advance in civilization.\r\nAn insurmountable limit was put to theirs by that bloody mythology which\r\nthrew its withering taint over the very air that they breathed.\r\n\r\nThe superiority of the Tezcucans was owing, doubtless, in a great\r\nmeasure to that of the two sovereigns whose reigns we have been\r\ndepicting. There is no position which affords such scope for\r\nameliorating the condition of man as that occupied by an absolute ruler\r\nover a nation imperfectly civilized. From his elevated place, commanding\r\nall the resources of his age, it is in his power to diffuse them far and\r\nwide among his people. He may be the copious reservoir on the\r\nmountain-top, drinking in the dews of heaven, to send them in\r\nfertilizing streams along the lower slopes and valleys, clothing even\r\nthe wilderness in beauty. Such were Nezahualcoyotl and his illustrious\r\nsuccessor, whose enlightened policy, extending through nearly a century,\r\nwrought a most salutary revolution in the condition of their country. It\r\nis remarkable that we, the inhabitants of the same continent, should be\r\nmore familiar with the history of many a barbarian chief, both in the\r\nOld and New World, than with that of these truly great men, whose names\r\nare identified with the most glorious period in the annals of the Indian\r\nraces.\r\n\r\nWhat was the actual amount of the Tezcucan civilization it is not easy\r\nto determine, with the imperfect light afforded us. It was certainly far\r\nbelow anything which the word conveys, measured by a European standard.\r\nIn some of the arts, and in any walk of science, they could only have\r\nmade, as it were, a beginning. But they had begun in the right way, and\r\nalready showed a refinement in sentiment and manners, a capacity for\r\nreceiving instruction, which, under good auspices, might have led them\r\non to indefinite improvement. Unhappily, they were fast falling under\r\nthe dominion of the warlike Aztecs. And that people repaid the benefits\r\nreceived from their more polished neighbors by imparting to them their\r\nown ferocious superstition, which, falling like a mildew on the land,\r\nwould soon have blighted its rich blossoms of promise and turned even\r\nits fruits to dust and ashes.\r\n\r\n     Fernando de Alva Ixtlilxochitl, who flourished in the beginning of\r\n     the sixteenth century,[348] was a native of Tezcuco, and descended\r\n     in a direct line from the sovereigns of that kingdom. The royal\r\n     posterity became so numerous in a few generations that it was\r\n     common to see them reduced to great poverty and earning a painful\r\n     subsistence by the most humble occupations. Ixtlilxochitl, who was\r\n     descended from the principal wife or queen of Nezahualpilli,\r\n     maintained a very respectable position. He filled the office of\r\n     interpreter to the viceroy, to which he was recommended by his\r\n     acquaintance with the ancient hieroglyphics and his knowledge of\r\n     the Mexican and Spanish languages. His birth gave him access to\r\n     persons of the highest rank in his own nation, some of whom\r\n     occupied important civil posts under the new government, and were\r\n     thus enabled to make large collections of Indian manuscripts, which\r\n     were liberally opened to him. He had an extensive library of his\r\n     own, also, and with these means diligently pursued the study of the\r\n     Tezcucan antiquities. He deciphered the hieroglyphics, made himself\r\n     master of the songs and traditions, and fortified his narrative by\r\n     the oral testimony of some very aged persons, who had themselves\r\n     been acquainted with the Conquerors. From such authentic sources he\r\n     composed various works in the Castilian, on the primitive history\r\n     of the Toltec and the Tezcucan races, continuing it down to the\r\n     subversion of the empire by Cortés. These various accounts,\r\n     compiled under the title of _Relaciones_, are, more or less,\r\n     repetitions and abridgments of each other; nor is it easy to\r\n     understand why they were thus composed. The _Historia Chichimeca_\r\n     is the best digested and most complete of the whole series, and as\r\n     such has been the most frequently consulted for the preceding\r\n     pages.\r\n\r\n     Ixtlilxochitl’s writings have many of the defects belonging to his\r\n     age. He often crowds the page with incidents of a trivial, and\r\n     sometimes improbable, character. The improbability increases with\r\n     the distance of the period; for distance, which diminishes objects\r\n     to the natural eye, exaggerates them to the mental. His chronology,\r\n     as I have more than once noticed, is inextricably entangled. He has\r\n     often lent a too willing ear to traditions and reports which would\r\n     startle the more skeptical criticism of the present time. Yet there\r\n     is an appearance of good faith and simplicity in his writings,\r\n     which may convince the reader that when he errs it is from no worse\r\n     cause than national partiality. And surely such partiality is\r\n     excusable in the descendant of a proud line, shorn of its ancient\r\n     splendors, which it was soothing to his own feelings to revive\r\n     again--though with something more than their legitimate lustre--on\r\n     the canvas of history. It should also be considered that, if his\r\n     narrative is sometimes startling, his researches penetrate into the\r\n     mysterious depths of antiquity, where light and darkness meet and\r\n     melt into each other, and where everything is still further liable\r\n     to distortion, as seen through the misty medium of\r\n     hieroglyphics.[349]\r\n\r\n     With these allowances, it will be found that the Tezcucan historian\r\n     has just claims to our admiration for the compass of his inquiries\r\n     and the sagacity with which they have been conducted. He has\r\n     introduced us to the knowledge of the most polished people of\r\n     Anahuac, whose records, if preserved, could not, at a much later\r\n     period, have been comprehended; and he has thus afforded a standard\r\n     of comparison which much raises our ideas of American civilization.\r\n     His language is simple, and, occasionally, eloquent and touching.\r\n     His descriptions are highly picturesque. He abounds in familiar\r\n     anecdote; and the natural graces of his manner, in detailing the\r\n     more striking events of history and the personal adventures of his\r\n     heroes, entitle him to the name of the Livy of Anahuac.\r\n\r\n     I shall be obliged to enter hereafter into his literary merits, in\r\n     connection with the narrative of the Conquest; for which he is a\r\n     prominent authority. His earlier annals--though no one of his\r\n     manuscripts has been printed--have been diligently studied by the\r\n     Spanish writers in Mexico, and liberally transferred to their\r\n     pages; and his reputation, like Sahagun’s, has doubtless suffered\r\n     by the process. His _Historia Chichimeca_ is now turned into French\r\n     by M. Ternaux-Compans, forming part of that inestimable series of\r\n     translations from unpublished documents which have so much enlarged\r\n     our acquaintance with the early American history. I have had ample\r\n     opportunity of proving the merits of his version of Ixtlilxochitl,\r\n     and am happy to bear my testimony to the fidelity and elegance with\r\n     which it is executed.\r\n\r\n            *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n     NOTE.--In a note which has heretofore appeared at the end of this\r\n     first book Mr. Prescott states that it had been his intention to\r\n     conclude the introductory portion of the work with an inquiry into\r\n     the origin of the Mexican civilization. But because he agreed with\r\n     Humboldt, that “the general question of the origin of the\r\n     inhabitants of a continent is beyond the limits prescribed to\r\n     history,” and with Livy, that “for the majority of readers the\r\n     origin and remote antiquities of a nation can have comparatively\r\n     little interest,” he had decided, on further consideration, to\r\n     throw his observations on this topic into the Appendix. A man of\r\n     extraordinary modesty, he feared lest the reader should become so\r\n     wearied with his presentation of the story of the earlier\r\n     civilization, in the first book, that he would not have energy\r\n     enough left for the proper consideration of the tale of the\r\n     Conquest, set forth with such conscientious care in the succeeding\r\n     chapters. The essay has now been taken from the Appendix and placed\r\n     in its proper position.--M.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE ORIGIN OF THE MEXICAN CIVILIZATION\r\n\r\n\r\nPRELIMINARY NOTICE\r\n\r\nThe following Essay was originally designed to close the Introductory\r\nBook, to which it properly belongs. It was written three years since, at\r\nthe same time with that part of the work. I know of no work of\r\nimportance, having reference to the general subject of discussion, which\r\nhas appeared since that period, except Mr. Bradford’s valuable treatise\r\non _American Antiquities_. But in respect to that part of the discussion\r\nwhich treats of American Architecture a most important contribution has\r\nbeen made by Mr. Stephens’s two works, containing the account of his\r\nvisits to Central America and Yucatan, and especially by the last of\r\nthese publications. Indeed, the ground, before so imperfectly known, has\r\nnow been so diligently explored that we have all the light which we can\r\nreasonably expect to aid us in making up our opinion in regard to the\r\nmysterious monuments of Yucatan. It only remains that the exquisite\r\nillustrations of Mr. Catherwood should be published on a larger scale,\r\nlike the great works on the subject in France and England, in order to\r\nexhibit to the eye a more adequate representation of these magnificent\r\nruins than can be given in the limited compass of an octavo page.\r\n\r\nBut, notwithstanding the importance of Mr. Stephens’s researches, I have\r\nnot availed myself of them to make any additions to the original draft\r\nof this Essay, nor have I rested my conclusions in any instance on his\r\nauthority. These conclusions had been formed from a careful study of the\r\nnarratives of Dupaix and Waldeck, together with that of their splendid\r\nillustrations of the remains of Palenque and Uxmal, two of the principal\r\nplaces explored by Mr. Stephens; and the additional facts collected by\r\nhim from the vast field which he has surveyed, so far from shaking my\r\nprevious deductions, have only served to confirm them. The only object\r\nof my own speculations on these remains was to ascertain their probable\r\norigin, or rather to see what light, if any, they could throw on the\r\norigin of Aztec Civilization. The reader, on comparing my reflections\r\nwith those of Mr. Stephens in the closing chapters of his two works,\r\nwill see that I have arrived at inferences, as to the origin and\r\nprobable antiquity of these structures, precisely the same as his.\r\nConclusions formed under such different circumstances serve to\r\ncorroborate each other; and, although the reader will find here some\r\nthings which would have been different had I been guided by the light\r\nnow thrown on the path, yet I prefer not to disturb the foundations on\r\nwhich the argument stands, nor to impair its value--if it has any--as a\r\ndistinct and independent testimony.\r\n\r\n\r\nORIGIN OF THE MEXICAN CIVILIZATION--ANALOGIES WITH THE OLD WORLD\r\n\r\nWhen the Europeans first touched the shores of America, it was as if\r\nthey had alighted on another planet,--every thing there was so different\r\nfrom what they had before seen. They were introduced to new varieties of\r\nplants, and to unknown races of animals; while man, the lord of all, was\r\nequally strange, in complexion, language, and institutions.[350] It was\r\nwhat they emphatically styled it,--a New World. Taught by their faith to\r\nderive all created beings from one source, they felt a natural\r\nperplexity as to the manner in which these distant and insulated regions\r\ncould have obtained their inhabitants. The same curiosity was felt by\r\ntheir countrymen at home, and the European scholars bewildered their\r\nbrains with speculations on the best way of solving this interesting\r\nproblem.\r\n\r\nIn accounting for the presence of animals there, some imagined that the\r\ntwo hemispheres might once have been joined in the extreme north, so as\r\nto have afforded an easy communication.[351] Others, embarrassed by the\r\ndifficulty of transporting inhabitants of the tropics across the Arctic\r\nregions, revived the old story of Plato’s Atlantis, that huge island,\r\nnow submerged, which might have stretched from the shores of Africa to\r\nthe eastern borders of the new continent;[352] while they saw vestiges\r\nof a similar convulsion of nature in the green islands sprinkled over\r\nthe Pacific, once the mountain summits of a vast continent, now buried\r\nbeneath the waters.[353] Some, distrusting the existence of revolutions\r\nof which no record was preserved, supposed that animals might have found\r\ntheir way across the ocean by various means; the birds of stronger wing\r\nby flight over the narrowest spaces; while the tamer kinds of quadrupeds\r\nmight easily have been transported by men in boats, and even the more\r\nferocious, as tigers, bears, and the like, have been brought over, in\r\nthe same manner, when young, “for amusement and the pleasure of the\r\nchase”![354] Others, again, maintained the equally probable opinion that\r\nangels, who had, doubtless, taken charge of them in the ark, had also\r\nsuperintended their distribution afterwards over the different parts of\r\nthe globe.[355] Such were the extremities to which even thinking minds\r\nwere reduced, in their eagerness to reconcile the literal interpretation\r\nof Scripture with the phenomena of nature! The philosophy of a later day\r\nconceives that it is no departure from this sacred authority to follow\r\nthe suggestions of science, by referring the new tribes of animals to a\r\ncreation, since the deluge, in those places for which they were clearly\r\nintended by constitution and habits.[356]\r\n\r\nMan would not seem to present the same embarrassments, in the\r\ndiscussion, as the inferior orders. He is fitted by nature for every\r\nclimate, the burning sun of the tropics and the icy atmosphere of the\r\nNorth. He wanders indifferently over the sands of the desert, the waste\r\nof polar snows, and the pathless ocean. Neither mountains nor seas\r\nintimidate him, and, by the aid of mechanical contrivances, he\r\naccomplishes journeys which birds of boldest wing would perish in\r\nattempting. Without ascending to the high northern latitudes, where the\r\ncontinents of Asia and America approach within fifty miles of each\r\nother, it would be easy for the inhabitant of Eastern Tartary or Japan\r\nto steer his canoe from islet to islet, quite across to the American\r\nshore, without ever being on the ocean more than two days at a\r\ntime.[357] The communication is somewhat more difficult on the Atlantic\r\nside. But even there, Iceland was occupied by colonies of Europeans many\r\nhundred years before the discovery by Columbus; and the transit from\r\nIceland to America is comparatively easy.[358] Independently of these\r\nchannels, others were opened in the Southern hemisphere, by means of\r\nthe numerous islands in the Pacific. The population of America is not\r\nnearly so difficult a problem as that of these little spots. But\r\nexperience shows how practicable the communication may have been, even\r\nwith such sequestered places.[359] The savage has been picked up in his\r\ncanoe, after drifting hundreds of leagues on the open ocean, and\r\nsustaining life, for months, by the rain from heaven, and such fish as\r\nhe could catch.[360] The instances are not very rare; and it would be\r\nstrange if these wandering barks should not sometimes have been\r\nintercepted by the great continent which stretches across the globe, in\r\nunbroken continuity, almost from pole to pole. No doubt, history could\r\nreveal to us more than one example of men who, thus driven upon the\r\nAmerican shores, have mingled their blood with that of the primitive\r\nraces who occupied them.\r\n\r\nThe real difficulty is not, as with the animals, to explain how man\r\ncould have reached America, but from what quarter he actually has\r\nreached it. In surveying the whole extent of the New World, it was found\r\nto contain two great families, one in the lowest stage of civilization,\r\ncomposed of hunters, and another nearly as far advanced in refinement as\r\nthe semi-civilized empires of Asia. The more polished races were\r\nprobably unacquainted with the existence of each other on the different\r\ncontinents of America, and had as little intercourse with the barbarian\r\ntribes by whom they were surrounded. Yet they had some things in common\r\nboth with these last and with one another, which remarkably\r\ndistinguished them from the inhabitants of the Old World. They had a\r\ncommon complexion and physical organization,--at least, bearing a more\r\nuniform character than is found among the nations of any other quarter\r\nof the globe. They had some usages and institutions in common, and spoke\r\nlanguages of similar construction, curiously distinguished from those in\r\nthe Eastern hemisphere.\r\n\r\nWhence did the refinement of these more polished races come? Was it only\r\na higher development of the same Indian character which we see, in the\r\nmore northern latitudes, defying every attempt at permanent\r\ncivilization? Was it engrafted on a race of higher order in the scale\r\noriginally, but self-instructed, working its way upward by its own\r\npowers? Was it, in short, an indigenous civilization? or was it borrowed\r\nin some degree from the nations in the Eastern World? If indigenous,\r\nhow are we to explain the singular coincidence with the East in\r\ninstitutions and opinions? If Oriental, how shall we account for the\r\ngreat dissimilarity in language, and for the ignorance of some of the\r\nmost simple and useful arts, which, once known, it would seem scarcely\r\npossible should have been forgotten? This is the riddle of the Sphinx,\r\nwhich no Œdipus has yet had the ingenuity to solve. It is, however, a\r\nquestion of deep interest to every curious and intelligent observer of\r\nhis species. And it has accordingly occupied the thoughts of men, from\r\nthe first discovery of the country to the present time; when the\r\nextraordinary monuments brought to light in Central America have given a\r\nnew impulse to inquiry, by suggesting the probability--the possibility,\r\nrather--that surer evidences than any hitherto known might be afforded\r\nfor establishing the fact of a positive communication with the other\r\nhemisphere.\r\n\r\nIt is not my intention to add many pages to the volumes already written\r\non this inexhaustible topic. The subject--as remarked by a writer of a\r\nphilosophical mind himself, and who has done more than any other for the\r\nsolution of the mystery--is of too speculative a nature for history,\r\nalmost for philosophy.[361] But this work would be incomplete without\r\naffording the reader the means of judging for himself as to the true\r\nsources of the peculiar civilization already described, by exhibiting\r\nto him the alleged points of resemblance with the ancient continent. In\r\ndoing this, I shall confine myself to my proper subject, the Mexicans,\r\nor to what, in some way or other, may have a bearing on this subject;\r\nproposing to state only real points of resemblance, as they are\r\nsupported by evidence, and stripped, as far as possible, of the\r\nillusions with which they have been invested by the pious credulity of\r\none party, and the visionary system-building of another.\r\n\r\nAn obvious analogy is found in _cosmogonal traditions_ and _religious\r\nusages_. The reader has already been made acquainted with the Aztec\r\nsystem of four great cycles, at the end of each of which the world was\r\ndestroyed, to be again regenerated.[362] The belief in these periodical\r\nconvulsions of nature, through the agency of some one or other of the\r\nelements, was familiar to many countries in the Eastern hemisphere; and,\r\nthough varying in detail, the general resemblance of outline furnishes\r\nan argument in favor of a common origin.[363]\r\n\r\nNo tradition has been more widely spread among nations than that of a\r\nDeluge. Independently of tradition, indeed, it would seem to be\r\nnaturally suggested by the interior structure of the earth, and by the\r\nelevated places on which marine substances are found to be deposited. It\r\nwas the received notion, under some form or other, of the most civilized\r\npeople in the Old World, and of the barbarians of the New.[364] The\r\nAztecs combined with this some particular circumstances of a more\r\narbitrary character, resembling the accounts of the East. They believed\r\nthat two persons survived the Deluge,--a man, named Coxcox, and his\r\nwife. Their heads are represented in ancient paintings, together with a\r\nboat floating on the waters, at the foot of a mountain. A dove is also\r\ndepicted, with the hieroglyphical emblem of languages in his mouth,\r\nwhich he is distributing to the children of Coxcox, who were born\r\ndumb.[365] The neighboring people of Michoacán, inhabiting the same high\r\nplains of the Andes, had a still further tradition, that the boat in\r\nwhich Tezpi, their Noah, escaped, was filled with various kinds of\r\nanimals and birds. After some time, a vulture was sent out from it, but\r\nremained feeding on the dead bodies of the giants, which had been left\r\non the earth, as the waters subsided. The little humming-bird,\r\n_huitzitzilin_, was then sent forth, and returned with a twig in its\r\nmouth. The coincidence of both these accounts with the Hebrew and\r\nChaldean narratives is obvious. It were to be wished that the authority\r\nfor the Michoacán version were more satisfactory.[366]\r\n\r\nOn the way between Vera Cruz and the capital, not far from the modern\r\ncity of Puebla, stands the venerable relic--with which the reader will\r\nbecome familiar in the course of the narrative--called the temple of\r\nCholula. It is a pyramidal mound, built, or rather cased, with unburnt\r\nbrick, rising to the height of nearly one hundred and eighty feet. The\r\npopular tradition of the natives is that it was erected by a family of\r\ngiants, who had escaped the great inundation and designed to raise the\r\nbuilding to the clouds; but the gods, offended with their presumption,\r\nsent fires from heaven on the pyramid, and compelled them to abandon the\r\nattempt.[367] The partial coincidence of this legend with the Hebrew\r\naccount of the tower of Babel, received also by other nations of the\r\nEast, cannot be denied.[368] But one who has not examined the subject\r\nwill scarcely credit what bold hypotheses have been reared on this\r\nslender basis.\r\n\r\nAnother point of coincidence is found in the goddess Cioacoatl, “our\r\nlady and mother;” “the first goddess who brought forth;” “who bequeathed\r\nthe sufferings of childbirth to women, as the tribute of death;” “by\r\nwhom sin came into the world.” Such was the remarkable language applied\r\nby the Aztecs to this venerated deity. She was usually represented with\r\na serpent near her; and her name signified the “serpent-woman.” In all\r\nthis we see much to remind us of the mother of the human family, the Eve\r\nof the Hebrew and Syrian nations.[369]\r\n\r\nBut none of the deities of the country suggested such astonishing\r\nanalogies with Scripture as Quetzalcoatl, with whom the reader has\r\nalready been made acquainted.[370] He was the white man, wearing a long\r\nbeard, who came from the East, and who, after presiding over the golden\r\nage of Anahuac, disappeared as mysteriously as he had come, on the great\r\nAtlantic Ocean. As he promised to return at some future day, his\r\nreappearance was looked for with confidence by each succeeding\r\ngeneration. There is little in these circumstances to remind one of\r\nChristianity. But the curious antiquaries of Mexico found out that to\r\nthis god were to be referred the institution of ecclesiastical\r\ncommunities, reminding one of the monastic societies of the Old World;\r\nthat of the rites of confession and penance; and the knowledge even of\r\nthe great doctrines of the Trinity and the Incarnation![371] One party,\r\nwith pious industry, accumulated proofs to establish his identity with\r\nthe Apostle St. Thomas;[372][373] while another, with less scrupulous\r\nfaith, saw, in his anticipated advent to regenerate the nation, the\r\ntype, dimly veiled, of the Messiah![374]\r\n\r\nYet we should have charity for the missionaries who first landed in this\r\nworld of wonders, where, while man and nature wore so strange an\r\naspect, they were astonished by occasional glimpses of rites and\r\nceremonies which reminded them of a purer faith. In their amazement,\r\nthey did not reflect whether these things were not the natural\r\nexpression of the religious feeling common to all nations who have\r\nreached even a moderate civilization. They did not inquire whether the\r\nsame things were not practised by other idolatrous people. They could\r\nnot suppress their wonder, as they beheld the Cross,[375] the sacred\r\nemblem of their own faith, raised as an object of worship in the temples\r\nof Anahuac. They met with it in various places; and the image of a cross\r\nmay be seen at this day, sculptured in bas-relief, on the walls of one\r\nof the buildings of Palenque, while a figure bearing some resemblance to\r\nthat of a child is held up to it, as if in adoration.[376]\r\n\r\nTheir surprise was heightened when they witnessed a religious rite which\r\nreminded them of the Christian communion. On these occasions an image of\r\nthe tutelary deity of the Aztecs was made of the flour of maize, mixed\r\nwith blood, and, after consecration by the priests, was distributed\r\namong the people, who, as they ate it, “showed signs of humiliation and\r\nsorrow, declaring it was the flesh of the deity!”[377] How could the\r\nRoman Catholic fail to recognize the awful ceremony of the Eucharist?\r\n\r\nWith the same feelings they witnessed another ceremony, that of the\r\nAztec baptism; in which, after a solemn invocation, the head and lips of\r\nthe infant were touched with water, and a name was given to it; while\r\nthe goddess Cioacoatl, who presided over childbirth, was implored “that\r\nthe sin which was given to us before the beginning of the world might\r\nnot visit the child, but that, cleansed by these waters, it might live\r\nand be born anew!”[378]\r\n\r\nIt is true, these several rites were attended with many peculiarities,\r\nvery unlike those in any Christian church. But the fathers fastened\r\ntheir eyes exclusively on the points of resemblance. They were not aware\r\nthat the Cross was a symbol of worship, of the highest antiquity, in\r\nEgypt and Syria,[379] and that rites resembling those of communion[380]\r\nand baptism were practised by pagan nations on whom the light of\r\nChristianity had never shone.[381] In their amazement, they not only\r\nmagnified what they saw, but were perpetually cheated by the illusions\r\nof their own heated imaginations. In this they were admirably assisted\r\nby their Mexican converts, proud to establish--and half believing it\r\nthemselves--a correspondence between their own faith and that of their\r\nconquerors.[382]\r\n\r\nThe ingenuity of the chronicler was taxed to find out analogies between\r\nthe Aztec and Scripture histories, both old and new. The migration from\r\nAztlan to Anahuac was typical of the Jewish exodus.[383] The places\r\nwhere the Mexicans halted on the march were identified with those in the\r\njourney of the Israelites;[384] and the name of Mexico itself was found\r\nto be nearly identical with the Hebrew name for the Messiah.[385] The\r\nMexican hieroglyphics afforded a boundless field for the display of this\r\ncritical acuteness. The most remarkable passages in the Old and New\r\nTestaments were read in their mysterious characters; and the eye of\r\nfaith could trace there the whole story of the Passion, the Saviour\r\nsuspended from the cross, and the Virgin Mary with her attendant\r\nangels![386]\r\n\r\nThe Jewish and Christian schemes were strangely mingled together, and\r\nthe brains of the good fathers were still further bewildered by the\r\nmixture of heathenish abominations which were so closely intertwined\r\nwith the most orthodox observances. In their perplexity, they looked on\r\nthe whole as the delusion of the devil, who counterfeited the rites of\r\nChristianity and the traditions of the chosen people, that he might\r\nallure his wretched victims to their own destruction.[387]\r\n\r\nBut, although it is not necessary to resort to this startling\r\nsupposition, nor even to call up an apostle from the dead, or any later\r\nmissionary, to explain the coincidences with Christianity, yet these\r\ncoincidences must be allowed to furnish an argument in favor of some\r\nprimitive communication with that great brotherhood of nations on the\r\nold continent, among whom similar ideas have been so widely\r\ndiffused.[388] The probability of such a communication, especially with\r\nEastern Asia, is much strengthened by the resemblance of sacerdotal\r\ninstitutions, and of some religious rites, as those of marriage,[389]\r\nand the burial of the dead;[390] by the practice of human sacrifices,\r\nand even of cannibalism, traces of which are discernible in the Mongol\r\nraces;[391] and, lastly, by a conformity of social usages and manners,\r\nso striking that the description of Montezuma’s court may well pass for\r\nthat of the Grand Khan’s, as depicted by Maundeville and Marco\r\nPolo.[392] It would occupy too much room to go into details in this\r\nmatter, without which, however, the strength of the argument cannot be\r\nfelt, nor fully established. It has been done by others; and an\r\noccasional coincidence has been adverted to in the preceding chapters.\r\n\r\nIt is true, we should be very slow to infer identity, or even\r\ncorrespondence, between nations, from a partial resemblance of habits\r\nand institutions. Where this relates to manners, and is founded on\r\ncaprice, it is not more conclusive than when it flows from the\r\nspontaneous suggestions of nature, common to all. The resemblance, in\r\nthe one case, may be referred to accident; in the other, to the\r\nconstitution of man. But there are certain arbitrary peculiarities,\r\nwhich, when found in different nations, reasonably suggest the idea of\r\nsome previous communication between them. Who can doubt the existence of\r\nan affinity, or, at least, intercourse, between tribes who had the same\r\nstrange habit of burying the dead in a sitting posture, as was practised\r\nto some extent by most, if not all, of the aborigines, from Canada to\r\nPatagonia?[393] The habit of burning the dead, familiar to both Mongols\r\nand Aztecs, is in itself but slender proof of a common origin. The body\r\nmust be disposed of in some way; and this, perhaps, is as natural as any\r\nother. But when to this is added the circumstance of collecting the\r\nashes in a vase and depositing the single article of a precious stone\r\nalong with them, the coincidence is remarkable.[394] Such minute\r\ncoincidences are not unfrequent; while the accumulation of those of a\r\nmore general character, though individually of little account, greatly\r\nstrengthens the probability of a communication with the East.\r\n\r\nA proof of a higher kind is found in the analogies of _science_. We have\r\nseen the peculiar chronological system of the Aztecs; their method of\r\ndistributing the years into cycles, and of reckoning by means of\r\nperiodical series, instead of numbers. A similar process was used by the\r\nvarious Asiatic nations of the Mongol family, from India to Japan. Their\r\ncycles, indeed, consisted of sixty, instead of fifty-two years; and for\r\nthe terms of their periodical series they employed the names of the\r\nelements and the signs of the zodiac, of which latter the Mexicans,\r\nprobably, had no knowledge. But the principle was precisely the\r\nsame.[395]\r\n\r\nA correspondence quite as extraordinary is found between the\r\nhieroglyphics used by the Aztecs for the signs of the days, and those\r\nzodiacal signs which the Eastern Asiatics employed as one of the terms\r\nof their series. The symbols in the Mongolian calendar are borrowed from\r\nanimals. Four of the twelve are the same as the Aztec. Three others are\r\nas nearly the same as the different species of animals in the two\r\nhemispheres would allow. The remaining five refer to no creature then\r\nfound in Anahuac.[396] The resemblance went as far as it could.[397] The\r\nsimilarity of these conventional symbols among the several nations of\r\nthe East can hardly fail to carry conviction of a common origin for the\r\nsystem as regards them. Why should not a similar conclusion be applied\r\nto the Aztec calendar, which, although relating to days instead of\r\nyears, was, like the Asiatic, equally appropriated to chronological\r\nuses and to those of divination?[398]\r\n\r\nI shall pass over the further resemblance to the Persians, shown in the\r\nadjustment of time by a similar system of intercalation;[399] and to the\r\nEgyptians, in the celebration of the remarkable festival of the winter\r\nsolstice;[400] since, although sufficiently curious, the coincidences\r\nmight be accidental, and add little to the weight of evidence offered by\r\nan agreement in combinations of so complex and artificial a character as\r\nthose before stated.\r\n\r\nAmid these intellectual analogies, one would expect to meet with that of\r\n_language_,[401] the vehicle of intellectual communication, which\r\nusually exhibits traces of its origin even when the science and\r\nliterature that are embodied in it have widely diverged. No inquiry,\r\nhowever, has led to satisfactory results. The languages spread over the\r\nWestern continent far exceed in number those found in any equal\r\npopulation in the Eastern.[402] They exhibit the remarkable anomaly of\r\ndiffering as widely in etymology as they agree in organization; and, on\r\nthe other hand, while they bear some slight affinity to the languages of\r\nthe Old World in the former particular, they have no resemblance to them\r\nwhatever in the latter.[403] The Mexican was spoken for an extent of\r\nthree hundred leagues. But within the boundaries of New Spain more than\r\ntwenty languages were found; not simply dialects, but, in many\r\ninstances, radically different.[404] All these idioms, however, with one\r\nexception, conformed to that peculiar synthetic structure by which every\r\nIndian dialect appears to have been fashioned, from the land of the\r\nEsquimaux to Terra del Fuego;[405] a system which, bringing the\r\ngreatest number of ideas within the smallest possible compass, condenses\r\nwhole sentences into a single word,[406] displaying a curious mechanism,\r\nin which some discern the hand of the philosopher, and others only the\r\nspontaneous efforts of the savage.[407]\r\n\r\nThe etymological affinities detected with the ancient continent are not\r\nvery numerous, and they are drawn indiscriminately from all the tribes\r\nscattered over America. On the whole, more analogies have been found\r\nwith the idioms of Asia than of any other quarter. But their amount is\r\ntoo inconsiderable to balance the opposite conclusion inferred by a\r\ntotal dissimilarity of structure.[408] A remarkable exception is found\r\nin the Othomi or Otomi language, which covers a wider territory than any\r\nother but the Mexican in New Spain,[409] and which, both in its\r\nmonosyllabic composition, so different from those around it, and in its\r\nvocabulary, shows a very singular affinity to the Chinese.[410] The\r\nexistence of this insulated idiom in the heart of this vast continent\r\noffers a curious theme for speculation, entirely beyond the province of\r\nhistory.\r\n\r\nThe American languages, so numerous and widely diversified, present an\r\nimmense field of inquiry, which, notwithstanding the labors of several\r\ndistinguished philologists, remains yet to be explored. It is only after\r\na wide comparison of examples that conclusions founded on analogy can be\r\ntrusted. The difficulty of making such comparisons increases with time,\r\nfrom the facility which the peculiar structure of the Indian languages\r\naffords for new combinations; while the insensible influence of contact\r\nwith civilized man, in producing these, must lead to a still further\r\ndistrust of our conclusions.\r\n\r\nThe theory of an Asiatic origin for Aztec civilization derives stronger\r\nconfirmation from the light of _tradition_, which, shining steadily from\r\nthe far Northwest, pierces through the dark shadows that history and\r\nmythology have alike thrown around the traditions of the country.\r\nTraditions of a Western or Northwestern origin were found among the\r\nmore barbarous tribes,[411] and by the Mexicans were preserved both\r\norally and in their hieroglyphical maps, where the different stages of\r\ntheir migration are carefully noted. But who, at this day, shall read\r\nthem?[412] They are admitted to agree, however, in representing the\r\npopulous North as the prolific hive of the American races.[413] In this\r\nquarter were placed their Aztlan and their Huehuetlapallan,--the bright\r\nabodes of their ancestors, whose warlike exploits rivalled those which\r\nthe Teutonic nations have recorded of Odin and the mythic heroes of\r\nScandinavia. From this quarter the Toltecs, the Chichimecs, and the\r\nkindred races of the Nahuatlacs came successively up the great plateau\r\nof the Andes, spreading over its hills and valleys, down to the Gulf of\r\nMexico.[414]\r\n\r\nAntiquaries have industriously sought to detect some still surviving\r\ntraces of these migrations. In the northwestern districts of New Spain,\r\nat the distance of a thousand miles from the capital, dialects have been\r\ndiscovered showing intimate affinity with the Mexican.[415] Along the\r\nRio Gila, remains of populous towns are to be seen, quite worthy of the\r\nAztecs in their style of architecture.[416] The country north of the\r\ngreat Rio Colorado has been imperfectly explored; but in the higher\r\nlatitudes, in the neighborhood of Nootka, tribes still exist whose\r\ndialects, both in the termination and general sound of the words, bear\r\nconsiderable resemblance to the Mexican.[417] Such are the vestiges,\r\nfew, indeed, and feeble, that still exist to attest the truth of\r\ntraditions which themselves have remained steady and consistent through\r\nthe lapse of centuries and the migrations of successive races.\r\n\r\nThe conclusions suggested by the intellectual and moral analogies with\r\nEastern Asia derive considerable support from those of a _physical\r\nnature_. The aborigines of the Western World were distinguished by\r\ncertain peculiarities of organization, which have led physiologists to\r\nregard them as a separate race. These peculiarities are shown in their\r\nreddish complexion, approaching a cinnamon color; their straight, black,\r\nand exceedingly glossy hair; their beard thin, and usually\r\neradicated;[418] their high cheek-bones, eyes obliquely directed towards\r\nthe temples, prominent noses, and narrow foreheads falling backwards\r\nwith a greater inclination than those of any other race except the\r\nAfrican.[419] From this general standard, however, there are deviations,\r\nin the same manner, if not to the same extent, as in other quarters of\r\nthe globe, though these deviations do not seem to be influenced by the\r\nsame laws of local position.[420] Anatomists, also, have discerned in\r\ncrania disinterred from the mounds, and in those of the inhabitants of\r\nthe high plains of the Cordilleras, an obvious difference from those of\r\nthe more barbarous tribes. This is seen especially in the ampler\r\nforehead, intimating a decided intellectual superiority.[421] These\r\ncharacteristics are found to bear a close resemblance to those of the\r\nMongolian family, and especially to the people of Eastern Tartary;[422]\r\nso that, notwithstanding certain differences recognized by\r\nphysiologists, the skulls of the two races could not be readily\r\ndistinguished from one another by a common observer. No inference can be\r\nsurely drawn, however, without a wide range of comparison. That hitherto\r\nmade has been chiefly founded on specimens from the barbarous\r\ntribes.[423] Perhaps a closer comparison with the more civilized may\r\nsupply still stronger evidences of affinity.[424]\r\n\r\nIn seeking for analogies with the Old World, we should not pass by in\r\nsilence the _architectural remains_ of the country, which, indeed, from\r\ntheir resemblance to the pyramidal structures of the East, have\r\nsuggested to more than one antiquary the idea of a common origin.[425]\r\nThe Spanish invaders, it is true, assailed the Indian buildings,\r\nespecially those of a religious character, with all the fury of\r\nfanaticism. The same spirit survived in the generations which succeeded.\r\nThe war has never ceased against the monuments of the country; and the\r\nfew that fanaticism has spared have been nearly all demolished to serve\r\nthe purposes of utility. Of all the stately edifices, so much extolled\r\nby the Spaniards who first visited the country, there are scarcely more\r\nvestiges at the present day than are to be found in some of those\r\nregions of Europe and Asia which once swarmed with populous cities, the\r\ngreat marts of luxury and commerce.[426] Yet some of these remains, like\r\nthe temple of Xochicalco,[427] the palaces of Tezcotzinco,[428] the\r\ncolossal calendar-stone in the capital, are of sufficient magnitude, and\r\nwrought with sufficient skill, to attest mechanical powers in the Aztecs\r\nnot unworthy to be compared with those of the ancient Egyptians.\r\n\r\nBut, if the remains on the Mexican soil are so scanty, they multiply as\r\nwe descend the southeastern slope of the Cordilleras, traverse the rich\r\nValley of Oaxaca, and penetrate the forests of Chiapa and Yucatan. In\r\nthe midst of these lonely regions we meet with the ruins, recently\r\ndiscovered, of several ancient cities, Mitla, Palenque, and Itzalana or\r\nUxmal,[429] which argue a higher civilization than anything yet found\r\non the American continent; and, although it was not the Mexicans who\r\nbuilt these cities, yet, as they are probably the work of cognate races,\r\nthe present inquiry would be incomplete without some attempt to\r\nascertain what light they can throw on the origin of the Indian, and\r\nconsequently of the Aztec civilization.[430]\r\n\r\nFew works of art have been found in the neighborhood of any of the\r\nruins.[431] Some of them, consisting of earthen or marble vases,\r\nfragments of statues, and the like, are fantastic, and even hideous;\r\nothers show much grace and beauty of design, and are apparently well\r\nexecuted.[432] It may seem extraordinary that no iron in the buildings\r\nthemselves, nor iron tools, should have been discovered, considering\r\nthat the materials used are chiefly granite, very hard, and carefully\r\nhewn and polished. Red copper chisels and axes have been picked up in\r\nthe midst of large blocks of granite imperfectly cut, with fragments of\r\npillars and architraves, in the quarries near Mitla.[433] Tools of a\r\nsimilar kind have been discovered, also, in the quarries near Thebes;\r\nand the difficulty, nay, impossibility, of cutting such masses from the\r\nliving rock with any tools which we possess, except iron, has confirmed\r\nan ingenious writer in the supposition that this metal must have been\r\nemployed by the Egyptians, but that its tendency to decomposition,\r\nespecially in a nitrous soil, has prevented any specimens of it from\r\nbeing preserved.[434] Yet iron has been found, after the lapse of some\r\nthousands of years, in the remains of antiquity; and it is certain that\r\nthe Mexicans, down to the time of the Conquest, used only copper\r\ninstruments, with an alloy of tin, and a silicious powder, to cut the\r\nhardest stones, some of them of enormous dimensions.[435] This fact,\r\nwith the additional circumstance that only similar tools have been\r\nfound in Central America, strengthens the conclusion that iron was\r\nneither known there nor in ancient Egypt.\r\n\r\nBut what are the nations of the Old Continent whose style of\r\narchitecture bears most resemblance to that of the remarkable monuments\r\nof Chiapa and Yucatan? The points of resemblance will probably be found\r\nneither numerous nor decisive. There is, indeed, some analogy both to\r\nthe Egyptian and Asiatic style of architecture in the pyramidal,\r\nterrace-formed bases on which the buildings repose, resembling also the\r\nToltec and Mexican _teocalli_. A similar care, also, is observed in the\r\npeople of both hemispheres to adjust the position of their buildings by\r\nthe cardinal points. The walls in both are covered with figures and\r\nhieroglyphics, which, on the American as on the Egyptian, may be\r\ndesigned, perhaps, to record the laws and historical annals of the\r\nnation. These figures, as well as the buildings themselves, are found to\r\nhave been stained with various dyes, principally vermilion;[436] a\r\nfavorite color with the Egyptians also, who painted their colossal\r\nstatues and temples of granite.[437] Notwithstanding these points of\r\nsimilarity, the Palenque architecture has little to remind us of the\r\nEgyptian or of the Oriental. It is, indeed, more conformable, in the\r\nperpendicular elevation of the walls, the moderate size of the stones,\r\nand the general arrangement of the parts, to the European. It must be\r\nadmitted, however, to have a character of originality peculiar to\r\nitself.\r\n\r\nMore positive proofs of communication with the East might be looked for\r\nin their sculpture and in the conventional forms of their hieroglyphics.\r\nBut the sculptures on the Palenque buildings are in relief, unlike the\r\nEgyptian, which are usually in _intaglio_. The Egyptians were not very\r\nsuccessful in their representations of the human figure, which are on\r\nthe same invariable model, always in profile, from the greater facility\r\nof execution this presents over the front view; the full eye is placed\r\non the side of the head, while the countenance is similar in all, and\r\nperfectly destitute of expression.[438] The Palenque artists were\r\nequally awkward in representing the various attitudes of the body, which\r\nthey delineated also in profile. But the parts are executed with much\r\ncorrectness, and sometimes gracefully; the costume is rich and various;\r\nand the ornamented head-dress, typical, perhaps, like the Aztec, of the\r\nname and condition of the person represented, conforms in its\r\nmagnificence to the Oriental taste. The countenance is various, and\r\noften expressive. The contour of the head is, indeed, most\r\nextraordinary, describing almost a semi-circle from the forehead to the\r\ntip of the nose, and contracted towards the crown, whether from the\r\nartificial pressure practised by many of the aborigines, or from some\r\npreposterous notion of ideal beauty.[439] But, while superior in the\r\nexecution of the details, the Palenque artist was far inferior to the\r\nEgyptian in the number and variety of the objects displayed by him,\r\nwhich on the Theban temples comprehend animals as well as men, and\r\nalmost every conceivable object of use or elegant art.\r\n\r\nThe hieroglyphics are too few on the American buildings to authorize any\r\ndecisive inference. On comparing them, however, with those of the\r\nDresden Codex, probably from this same quarter of the country,[440] with\r\nthose on the monument of Xochicalco, and with the ruder picture-writing\r\nof the Aztecs, it is not easy to discern anything which indicates a\r\ncommon system. Still less obvious is the resemblance to the Egyptian\r\ncharacters, whose refined and delicate abbreviations approach almost to\r\nthe simplicity of an alphabet. Yet the Palenque writing shows an\r\nadvanced stage of the art, and, though somewhat clumsy, intimates, by\r\nthe conventional and arbitrary forms of the hieroglyphics, that it was\r\nsymbolical, and perhaps phonetic, in its character.[441] That its\r\nmysterious import will ever be deciphered is scarcely to be expected.\r\nThe language of the race who employed it, the race itself, is unknown.\r\nAnd it is not likely that another Rosetta stone will be found, with its\r\ntrilingual inscription, to supply the means of comparison, and to guide\r\nthe American Champollion in the path of discovery.\r\n\r\nIt is impossible to contemplate these mysterious monuments of a lost\r\ncivilization without a strong feeling of curiosity as to who were their\r\narchitects and what is their probable age. The data on which to rest our\r\nconjectures of their age are not very substantial; although some find in\r\nthem a warrant for an antiquity of thousands of years, coeval with the\r\narchitecture of Egypt and Hindostan.[442] But the interpretation of\r\nhieroglyphics, and the apparent duration of trees, are vague and\r\nunsatisfactory.[443] And how far can we derive an argument from the\r\ndiscoloration and dilapidated condition of the ruins, when we find so\r\nmany structures of the Middle Ages dark and mouldering with decay, while\r\nthe marbles of the Acropolis and the gray stone of Pæstum still shine in\r\ntheir primitive splendor?\r\n\r\nThere are, however, undoubted proofs of considerable age to be found\r\nthere. Trees have shot up in the midst of the buildings, which measure,\r\nit is said, more than nine feet in diameter.[444] A still more striking\r\nfact is the accumulation of vegetable mould in one of the courts, to the\r\ndepth of nine feet above the pavement.[445] This in our latitude would\r\nbe decisive of a very great antiquity. But in the rich soil of Yucatan,\r\nand under the ardent sun of the tropics, vegetation bursts forth with\r\nirrepressible exuberance, and generations of plants succeed each other\r\nwithout intermission, leaving an accumulation of deposits that would\r\nhave perished under a northern winter. Another evidence of their age is\r\nafforded by the circumstance that in one of the courts of Uxmal the\r\ngranite pavement,[446] on which the figures of tortoises were raised in\r\nrelief, is worn nearly smooth by the feet of the crowds who have passed\r\nover it;[447] a curious fact, suggesting inferences both in regard to\r\nthe age and population of the place. Lastly, we have authority for\r\ncarrying back the date of many of these ruins to a certain period, since\r\nthey were found in a deserted, and probably dilapidated, state by the\r\nfirst Spaniards who entered the country. Their notices, indeed, are\r\nbrief and casual, for the old Conquerors had little respect for works of\r\nart;[448] and it is fortunate for these structures that they had ceased\r\nto be the living temples of the gods, since no merit of architecture,\r\nprobably, would have availed to save them from the general doom of the\r\nmonuments of Mexico.\r\n\r\nIf we find it so difficult to settle the age of these buildings, what\r\ncan we hope to know of their architects? Little can be gleaned from the\r\nrude people by whom they are surrounded. The old Tezcucan chronicler so\r\noften quoted by me, the best authority for the traditions of his\r\ncountry, reports that the Toltecs, on the breaking up of their\r\nempire,--which he places earlier than most authorities, in the middle of\r\nthe tenth century,--migrating from Anahuac, spread themselves over\r\nGuatemala, Tehuantepec, Campeachy, and the coasts and neighboring isles\r\non both sides of the Isthmus.[449] This assertion, important,\r\nconsidering its source, is confirmed by the fact that several of the\r\nnations in that quarter adopted systems of astronomy and chronology, as\r\nwell as sacerdotal institutions, very similar to the Aztec,[450] which,\r\nas we have seen, were also probably derived from the Toltecs, their more\r\npolished predecessors in the land.\r\n\r\nIf so recent a date for the construction of the American buildings be\r\nthought incompatible with this oblivion of their origin, it should be\r\nremembered how treacherous a thing is tradition, and how easily the\r\nlinks of the chain are severed. The builders of the pyramids had been\r\nforgotten before the time of the earliest Greek historians.[451] The\r\nantiquary still disputes whether the frightful inclination of that\r\narchitectural miracle, the tower of Pisa, standing, as it does, in the\r\nheart of a populous city, was the work of accident or design. And we\r\nhave seen how soon the Tezcucans, dwelling amidst the ruins of their\r\nroyal palaces, built just before the Conquest, had forgotten their\r\nhistory, while the more inquisitive traveller refers their construction\r\nto some remote period before the Aztecs.[452]\r\n\r\nThe reader has now seen the principal points of coincidence insisted on\r\nbetween the civilization of ancient Mexico and the Eastern hemisphere.\r\nIn presenting them to him, I have endeavored to confine myself to such\r\nas rest on sure historic grounds, and not so much to offer my own\r\nopinion as to enable him to form one for himself. There are some\r\nmaterial embarrassments in the way to this, however, which must not be\r\npassed over in silence. These consist, not in explaining the fact that,\r\nwhile the mythic system and the science of the Aztecs afford some\r\nstriking points of analogy with the Asiatic, they should differ in so\r\nmany more; for the same phenomenon is found among the nations of the Old\r\nWorld, who seem to have borrowed from one another those ideas, only,\r\nbest suited to their peculiar genius and institutions. Nor does the\r\ndifficulty lie in accounting for the great dissimilarity of the American\r\nlanguages to those in the other hemisphere; for the difference with\r\nthese is not greater than what exists among themselves; and no one will\r\ncontend for a separate origin for each of the aboriginal tribes.[453]\r\nBut it is scarcely possible to reconcile the knowledge of Oriental\r\nscience with the total ignorance of some of the most serviceable and\r\nfamiliar arts, as the use of milk and iron, for example; arts so\r\nsimple, yet so important to domestic comfort, that when once acquired\r\nthey could hardly be lost.\r\n\r\nThe Aztecs had no useful domesticated animals. And we have seen that\r\nthey employed bronze, as a substitute for iron, for all mechanical\r\npurposes. The bison, or wild cow of America, however, which ranges in\r\ncountless herds over the magnificent prairies of the west, yields milk\r\nlike the tame animal of the same species in Asia and Europe;[454] and\r\niron was scattered in large masses over the surface of the table-land.\r\nYet there have been people considerably civilized in Eastern Asia who\r\nwere almost equally strangers to the use of milk.[455] The buffalo range\r\nwas not so much on the western coast as on the eastern slopes of the\r\nRocky Mountains;[456] and the migratory Aztec might well doubt whether\r\nthe wild, uncouth monsters whom he occasionally saw bounding with such\r\nfury over the distant plains were capable of domestication, like the\r\nmeek animals which he had left grazing in the green pastures of Asia.\r\nIron, too, though met with on the surface of the ground, was more\r\ntenacious, and harder to work, than copper, which he also found in much\r\ngreater quantities on his route. It is possible, moreover, that his\r\nmigration may have been previous to the time when iron was used by his\r\nnation; for we have seen more than one people in the Old World employing\r\nbronze and copper with entire ignorance, apparently, of any more\r\nserviceable metal.[457]--Such is the explanation, unsatisfactory,\r\nindeed, but the best that suggests itself, of this curious anomaly.\r\n\r\nThe consideration of these and similar difficulties has led some writers\r\nto regard the antique American civilization as purely indigenous.\r\nWhichever way we turn, the subject is full of embarrassment. It is easy,\r\nindeed, by fastening the attention on one portion of it, to come to a\r\nconclusion. In this way, while some feel little hesitation in\r\npronouncing the American civilization original, others, no less\r\ncertainly, discern in it a Hebrew, or an Egyptian, or a Chinese, or a\r\nTartar origin, as their eyes are attracted by the light of analogy too\r\nexclusively to this or the other quarter. The number of contradictory\r\nlights, of itself, perplexes the judgment and prevents us from arriving\r\nat a precise and positive inference. Indeed, the affectation of this, in\r\nso doubtful a matter, argues a most unphilosophical mind. Yet where\r\nthere is most doubt there is often the most dogmatism.\r\n\r\nThe reader of the preceding pages may perhaps acquiesce in the general\r\nconclusions,--not startling by their novelty,--\r\n\r\nFirst, that the coincidences are sufficiently strong to authorize a\r\nbelief that the civilization of Anahuac was in some degree influenced by\r\nthat of Eastern Asia.\r\n\r\nAnd, secondly, that the discrepancies are such as to carry back the\r\ncommunication to a very remote period; so remote that this foreign\r\ninfluence has been too feeble to interfere materially with the growth\r\nof what may be regarded in its essential features as a peculiar and\r\nindigenous civilization.[458]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBOOK II\r\n\r\nDISCOVERY OF MEXICO\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PORTRAIT OF CHARLES V.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Goupil & Cº. Paris_]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBOOK II\r\n\r\nDISCOVERY OF MEXICO\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER I\r\n\r\n     SPAIN UNDER CHARLES V--PROGRESS OF DISCOVERY--COLONIAL\r\n     POLICY--CONQUEST OF CUBA--EXPEDITIONS TO YUCATAN\r\n\r\n1516-1518\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the beginning of the sixteenth century, Spain occupied perhaps the\r\nmost prominent position on the theatre of Europe. The numerous states\r\ninto which she had been so long divided were consolidated into one\r\nmonarchy. The Moslem crescent, after reigning there for eight centuries,\r\nwas no longer seen on her borders. The authority of the crown did not,\r\nas in later times, overshadow the inferior orders of the state. The\r\npeople enjoyed the inestimable privilege of political representation,\r\nand exercised it with manly independence. The nation at large could\r\nboast as great a degree of constitutional freedom as any other, at that\r\ntime, in Christendom. Under a system of salutary laws and an equitable\r\nadministration, domestic tranquillity was secured, public credit\r\nestablished, trade, manufactures, and even the more elegant arts, began\r\nto flourish; while a higher education called forth the first blossoms of\r\nthat literature which was to ripen into so rich a harvest before the\r\nclose of the century. Arms abroad kept pace with arts at home. Spain\r\nfound her empire suddenly enlarged by important acquisitions both in\r\nEurope and Africa, while a New World beyond the waters poured into her\r\nlap treasures of countless wealth and opened an unbounded field for\r\nhonorable enterprise.\r\n\r\nSuch was the condition of the kingdom at the close of the long and\r\nglorious reign of Ferdinand and Isabella, when, on the 23d of January,\r\n1516, the sceptre passed into the hands of their daughter Joanna, or\r\nrather their grandson,[459] Charles the Fifth, who alone ruled the\r\nmonarchy during the long and imbecile existence of his unfortunate\r\nmother. During the two years following Ferdinand’s death, the regency,\r\nin the absence of Charles, was held by Cardinal Ximenes, a man whose\r\nintrepidity, extraordinary talents, and capacity for great enterprises\r\nwere accompanied by a haughty spirit, which made him too indifferent as\r\nto the means of their execution. His administration, therefore,\r\nnotwithstanding the uprightness of his intentions, was, from his total\r\ndisregard of forms, unfavorable to constitutional liberty; for respect\r\nfor forms is an essential element of freedom. With all his faults,\r\nhowever, Ximenes was a Spaniard; and the object he had at heart was the\r\ngood of his country.\r\n\r\nIt was otherwise on the arrival of Charles, who, after a long absence,\r\ncame as a foreigner into the land of his fathers. (November, 1517.) His\r\nmanners, sympathies, even his language, were foreign, for he spoke the\r\nCastilian with difficulty. He knew little of his native country, of the\r\ncharacter of the people or their institutions. He seemed to care still\r\nless for them; while his natural reserve precluded that freedom of\r\ncommunication which might have counteracted, to some extent, at least,\r\nthe errors of education. In everything, in short, he was a foreigner,\r\nand resigned himself to the direction of his Flemish counsellors with a\r\ndocility that gave little augury of his future greatness.\r\n\r\nOn his entrance into Castile, the young monarch was accompanied by a\r\nswarm of courtly sycophants, who settled, like locusts, on every place\r\nof profit and honor throughout the kingdom. A Fleming was made grand\r\nchancellor of Castile; another Fleming was placed in the archiepiscopal\r\nsee of Toledo. They even ventured to profane the sanctity of the Cortes,\r\nby intruding themselves on its deliberations. Yet that body did not\r\ntamely submit to these usurpations, but gave vent to its indignation in\r\ntones becoming the representatives of a free people.[460]\r\n\r\nThe deportment of Charles, so different from that to which the Spaniards\r\nhad been accustomed under the benign administration of Ferdinand and\r\nIsabella, closed all hearts against him; and, as his character came to\r\nbe understood, instead of the spontaneous outpourings of loyalty which\r\nusually greet the accession of a new and youthful sovereign, he was\r\neverywhere encountered by opposition and disgust. In Castile, and\r\nafterwards in Aragon, Catalonia, and Valencia, the commons hesitated to\r\nconfer on him the title of _King_ during the lifetime of his mother;\r\nand, though they eventually yielded this point, and associated his name\r\nwith hers in the sovereignty, yet they reluctantly granted the supplies\r\nhe demanded, and, when they did so, watched over their appropriation\r\nwith a vigilance which left little to gratify the cupidity of the\r\nFlemings. The language of the legislature on these occasions, though\r\ntemperate and respectful, breathes a spirit of resolute independence not\r\nto be found, probably, on the parliamentary records of any other nation\r\nat that period. No wonder that Charles should have early imbibed a\r\ndisgust for these popular assemblies,--the only bodies whence truths so\r\nunpalatable could find their way to the ears of the sovereign![461]\r\nUnfortunately, they had no influence on his conduct; till the\r\ndiscontent, long allowed to fester in secret, broke out in that sad war\r\nof the _comunidades_, which shook the state to its foundations and ended\r\nin the subversion of its liberties.[462]\r\n\r\nThe same pestilent foreign influence was felt, though much less\r\nsensibly, in the colonial administration. This had been placed, in the\r\npreceding reign, under the immediate charge of the two great tribunals,\r\nthe Council of the Indies, and the _Casa de Contratacion_, or India\r\nHouse, at Seville. It was their business to further the progress of\r\ndiscovery, watch over the infant settlements, and adjust the disputes\r\nwhich grew up in them. But the licenses granted to private adventurers\r\ndid more for the cause of discovery than the patronage of the crown or\r\nits officers. The long peace, enjoyed with slight interruption by Spain\r\nin the early part of the sixteenth century, was most auspicious for\r\nthis; and the restless cavalier, who could no longer win laurels on the\r\nfields of Africa or Europe, turned with eagerness to the brilliant\r\ncareer opened to him beyond the ocean.\r\n\r\nIt is difficult for those of our time, as familiar from childhood with\r\nthe most remote places on the globe as with those in their own\r\nneighborhood, to picture to themselves the feelings of the men who lived\r\nin the sixteenth century. The dread mystery which had so long hung over\r\nthe great deep had, indeed, been removed. It was no longer beset with\r\nthe same undefined horrors as when Columbus launched his bold bark on\r\nits dark and unknown waters. A new and glorious world had been thrown\r\nopen. But as to the precise spot where that world lay, its extent, its\r\nhistory, whether it were island or continent,--of all this they had very\r\nvague and confused conceptions. Many, in their ignorance, blindly\r\nadopted the erroneous conclusion into which the great Admiral had been\r\nled by his superior science,--that the new countries were a part of\r\nAsia; and, as the mariner wandered among the Bahamas, or steered his\r\ncaravel across the Caribbean Seas, he fancied he was inhaling the rich\r\nodors of the spice-islands in the Indian Ocean. Thus every fresh\r\ndiscovery, interpreted by this previous delusion, served to confirm him\r\nin his error, or, at least, to fill his mind with new perplexities.\r\n\r\nThe career thus thrown open had all the fascinations of a desperate\r\nhazard, on which the adventurer staked all his hopes of fortune, fame,\r\nand life itself. It was not often, indeed, that he won the rich prize\r\nwhich he most coveted; but then he was sure to win the meed of glory,\r\nscarcely less dear to his chivalrous spirit; and, if he survived to\r\nreturn to his home, he had wonderful stories to recount, of perilous\r\nchances among the strange people he had visited, and the burning climes\r\nwhose rank fertility and magnificence of vegetation so far surpassed\r\nanything he had witnessed in his own. These reports added fresh fuel to\r\nimaginations already warmed by the study of those tales of chivalry\r\nwhich formed the favorite reading of the Spaniards at that period. Thus\r\nromance and reality acted on each other, and the soul of the Spaniard\r\nwas exalted to that pitch of enthusiasm which enabled him to encounter\r\nthe terrible trials that lay in the path of the discoverer. Indeed, the\r\nlife of the cavalier of that day was romance put into action. The story\r\nof his adventures in the New World forms one of the most remarkable\r\npages in the history of man.\r\n\r\nUnder this chivalrous spirit of enterprise, the progress of discovery\r\nhad extended, by the beginning of Charles the Fifth’s reign, from the\r\nBay of Honduras, along the winding shores of Darien, and the South\r\nAmerican continent, to the Rio de la Plata. The mighty barrier of the\r\nIsthmus had been climbed, and the Pacific descried, by Nuñez de Balboa,\r\nsecond only to Columbus in this valiant band of “ocean chivalry.” The\r\nBahamas and Caribbee Islands had been explored, as well as the Peninsula\r\nof Florida on the northern continent. This latter point had been reached\r\nby Sebastian Cabot in his descent along the coast from Labrador, in\r\n1497. So that before 1518, the period when our narrative begins, the\r\neastern borders of both the great continents had been surveyed through\r\nnearly their whole extent. The shores of the great Mexican Gulf,\r\nhowever, sweeping with a wide circuit far into the interior, remained\r\nstill concealed, with the rich realms that lay beyond, from the eye of\r\nthe navigator. The time had now come for their discovery.\r\n\r\nThe business of colonization had kept pace with that of discovery. In\r\nseveral of the islands, and in various parts of Terra Firma, and in\r\nDarien, settlements had been established, under the control of governors\r\nwho affected the state and authority of viceroys. Grants of land were\r\nassigned to the colonists, on which they raised the natural products of\r\nthe soil, but gave still more attention to the sugar-cane, imported from\r\nthe Canaries. Sugar, indeed, together with the beautiful dye-woods of\r\nthe country and the precious metals, formed almost the only articles of\r\nexport in the infancy of the colonies, which had not yet introduced\r\nthose other staples of the West Indian commerce which in our day\r\nconstitute its principal wealth. Yet the precious metals, painfully\r\ngleaned from a few scanty sources, would have made poor returns, but for\r\nthe gratuitous labor of the Indians.\r\n\r\nThe cruel system of _repartimientos_, or distribution of the Indians as\r\nslaves among the conquerors, had been suppressed by Isabella. Although\r\nsubsequently countenanced by the government, it was under the most\r\ncareful limitations. But it is impossible to license crime by\r\nhalves,--to authorize injustice at all, and hope to regulate the measure\r\nof it. The eloquent remonstrances of the Dominicans,--who devoted\r\nthemselves to the good work of conversion in the New World with the same\r\nzeal that they showed for persecution in the Old,--but, above all, those\r\nof Las Casas, induced the regent, Ximenes, to send out a commission with\r\nfull powers to inquire into the alleged grievances and to redress them.\r\nIt had authority, moreover, to investigate the conduct of the civil\r\nofficers, and to reform any abuses in their administration. This\r\nextraordinary commission consisted of three Hieronymite friars and an\r\neminent jurist, all men of learning and unblemished piety.\r\n\r\nThey conducted the inquiry in a very dispassionate manner, but, after\r\nlong deliberation, came to a conclusion most unfavorable to the demands\r\nof Las Casas, who insisted on the entire freedom of the natives. This\r\nconclusion they justified on the grounds that the Indians would not\r\nlabor without compulsion, and that, unless they labored, they could not\r\nbe brought into communication with the whites, nor be converted to\r\nChristianity. Whatever we may think of this argument, it was doubtless\r\nurged with sincerity by its advocates, whose conduct through their whole\r\nadministration places their motives above suspicion. They accompanied it\r\nwith many careful provisions for the protection of the natives. But in\r\nvain. The simple people, accustomed all their days to a life of\r\nindolence and ease, sank under the oppressions of their masters, and the\r\npopulation wasted away with even more frightful rapidity than did the\r\naborigines in our own country under the operation of other causes. It is\r\nnot necessary to pursue these details further, into which I have been\r\nled by the desire to put the reader in possession of the general policy\r\nand state of affairs in the New World at the period when the present\r\nnarrative begins.[463]\r\n\r\nOf the islands, Cuba was the second discovered; but no attempt had been\r\nmade to plant a colony there during the lifetime of Columbus, who,\r\nindeed, after skirting the whole extent of its southern coast, died in\r\nthe conviction that it was part of the continent.[464] At length, in\r\n1511, Diego, the son and successor of the “Admiral,” who still\r\nmaintained the seat of government in Hispaniola,[465] finding the mines\r\nmuch exhausted there, proposed to occupy the neighboring island of Cuba,\r\nor Fernandina, as it was called in compliment to the Spanish\r\nmonarch.[466] He prepared a small force for the conquest, which he\r\nplaced under the command of Don Diego Velasquez; a man described by a\r\ncontemporary as “possessed of considerable experience in military\r\naffairs, having served seventeen years in the European wars; as honest,\r\nillustrious by his lineage and reputation, covetous of glory, and\r\nsomewhat more covetous of wealth.”[467] The portrait was sketched by no\r\nunfriendly hand.\r\n\r\nVelasquez, or rather his lieutenant, Narvaez, who took the office on\r\nhimself of scouring the country, met with no serious opposition from the\r\ninhabitants, who were of the same family with the effeminate natives of\r\nHispaniola. The conquest, through the merciful interposition of Las\r\nCasas, “the protector of the Indians,” who accompanied the army in its\r\nmarch, was effected without much bloodshed. One chief, indeed, named\r\nHatuey, having fled originally from St. Domingo to escape the oppression\r\nof its invaders, made a desperate resistance, for which he was condemned\r\nby Velasquez to be burned alive. It was he who made that memorable\r\nreply, more eloquent than a volume of invective. When urged at the stake\r\nto embrace Christianity, that his soul might find admission into heaven,\r\nhe inquired if the white men would go there. On being answered in the\r\naffirmative, he exclaimed, “Then I will not be a Christian; for I would\r\nnot go again to a place where I must find men so cruel!”[468]\r\n\r\nAfter the conquest, Velasquez, now appointed governor, diligently\r\noccupied himself with measures for promoting the prosperity of the\r\nisland. He formed a number of settlements, bearing the same names with\r\nthe modern towns, and made St. Jago,[469] on the southeast corner, the\r\nseat of government.[470] He invited settlers by liberal grants of land\r\nand slaves. He encouraged them to cultivate the soil, and gave\r\nparticular attention to the sugar-cane, so profitable an article of\r\ncommerce in later times. He was, above all, intent on working the\r\ngold-mines, which promised better returns than those in Hispaniola. The\r\naffairs of his government did not prevent him, meanwhile, from casting\r\nmany a wistful glance at the discoveries going forward on the continent,\r\nand he longed for an opportunity to embark in these golden adventures\r\nhimself. Fortune gave him the occasion he desired.\r\n\r\nAn _hidalgo_ of Cuba, named Hernandez de Cordova, sailed with three\r\nvessels on an expedition to one of the neighboring Bahama Islands, in\r\nquest of Indian slaves.[471] (February 8, 1517.) He encountered a\r\nsuccession of heavy gales which drove him far out of his course, and at\r\nthe end of three weeks he found himself on a strange and unknown coast.\r\nOn landing and asking the name of the country, he was answered by the\r\nnatives, “_Tectetan_,” meaning, “I do not understand you,”--but which\r\nthe Spaniards, misinterpreting into the name of the place, easily\r\ncorrupted into Yucatan. Some writers give a different etymology.[472]\r\nSuch mistakes, however, were not uncommon with the early discoverers,\r\nand have been the origin of many a name on the American continent.[473]\r\n\r\nCordova had landed on the northeastern end of the peninsula, at Cape\r\nCatoche. He was astonished at the size and solid materials of the\r\nbuildings, constructed of stone and lime, so different from the frail\r\ntenements of reeds and rushes which formed the habitations of the\r\nislanders. He was struck, also, with the higher cultivation of the soil,\r\nand with the delicate texture of the cotton garments and gold ornaments\r\nof the natives. Everything indicated a civilization far superior to\r\nanything he had before witnessed in the New World. He saw the evidence\r\nof a different race, moreover, in the warlike spirit of the people.\r\nRumors of the Spaniards had, perhaps, preceded them, as they were\r\nrepeatedly asked if they came from the east; and wherever they landed\r\nthey were met with the most deadly hostility. Cordova himself, in one of\r\nhis skirmishes with the Indians, received more than a dozen wounds, and\r\none only of his party escaped unhurt. At length, when he had coasted the\r\npeninsula as far as Campeachy, he returned to Cuba, which he reached\r\nafter an absence of several months, having suffered all the extremities\r\nof ill which these pioneers of the ocean were sometimes called to\r\nendure, and which none but the most courageous spirit could have\r\nsurvived. As it was, half the original number, consisting of one hundred\r\nand ten men, perished, including their brave commander, who died soon\r\nafter his return. The reports he had brought back of the country, and,\r\nstill more, the specimens of curiously wrought gold, convinced Velasquez\r\nof the importance of this discovery, and he prepared with all despatch\r\nto avail himself of it.[474]\r\n\r\nHe accordingly fitted out a little squadron of four vessels for the\r\nnewly-discovered lands, and placed it under the command of his nephew,\r\nJuan de Grijalva, a man on whose probity, prudence, and attachment to\r\nhimself he knew he could rely. The fleet left the port of St. Jago de\r\nCuba, May 1, 1518.[475][476] It took the course pursued by Cordova, but\r\nwas driven somewhat to the south, the first land that it made being the\r\nisland of Cozumel. From this quarter Grijaiva soon passed over to the\r\ncontinent, and coasted the peninsula, touching at the same place as his\r\npredecessor. Everywhere he was struck, like him, with the evidences of a\r\nhigher civilization, especially in the architecture; as he well might\r\nbe, since this was the region of those extraordinary remains which have\r\nbecome recently the subject of so much speculation. He was astonished,\r\nalso, at the sight of large stone crosses, evidently objects of worship,\r\nwhich he met with in various places. Reminded by these circumstances of\r\nhis own country, he gave the peninsula the name of “New Spain,” a name\r\nsince appropriated to a much wider extent of territory.[477]\r\n\r\nWherever Grijalva landed, he experienced the same unfriendly reception\r\nas Cordova; though he suffered less, being better prepared to meet it.\r\nIn the _Rio de Tabasco_, or _Grijalva_, as it is often called, after\r\nhim, he held an amicable conference with a chief who gave him a number\r\nof gold plates fashioned into a sort of armor. As he wound round the\r\nMexican coast, one of his captains, Pedro de Alvarado, afterwards famous\r\nin the Conquest, entered a river, to which he, also, left his own name.\r\nIn a neighboring stream, called the _Rio de Vanderas_, or “River of\r\nBanners,” from the ensigns displayed by the natives on its borders,\r\nGrijaiva had the first communication with the Mexicans themselves.\r\n\r\nThe cacique who ruled over this province had received notice of the\r\napproach of the Europeans, and of their extraordinary appearance. He was\r\nanxious to collect all the information he could respecting them and the\r\nmotives of their visit, that he might transmit them to his master, the\r\nAztec emperor.[478] A friendly conference took place between the parties\r\non shore, where Grijalva landed with all his force, so as to make a\r\nsuitable impression on the mind of the barbaric chief. The interview\r\nlasted some hours, though, as there was no one on either side to\r\ninterpret the language of the other, they could communicate only by\r\nsigns. They, however, interchanged presents, and the Spaniards had the\r\nsatisfaction of receiving, for a few worthless toys and trinkets, a rich\r\ntreasure of jewels, gold ornaments and vessels, of the most fantastic\r\nforms and workmanship.[479]\r\n\r\nGrijalva now thought that in this successful traffic--successful beyond\r\nhis most sanguine expectations--he had accomplished the chief object of\r\nhis mission. He steadily refused the solicitations of his followers to\r\nplant a colony on the spot,--a work of no little difficulty in so\r\npopulous and powerful a country as this appeared to be. To this, indeed,\r\nhe was inclined, but deemed it contrary to his instructions, which\r\nlimited him to barter with the natives. He therefore despatched Alvarado\r\nin one of the caravels back to Cuba, with the treasure and such\r\nintelligence as he had gleaned of the great empire in the interior, and\r\nthen pursued his voyage along the coast.\r\n\r\nHe touched at San Juan de Ulua, and at the _Isla de los Sacrificios_, so\r\ncalled by him from the bloody remains of human victims found in one of\r\nthe temples. He then held on his course as far as the province of\r\nPanuco, where, finding some difficulty in doubling a boisterous\r\nheadland, he returned on his track, and, after an absence of nearly six\r\nmonths, reached Cuba in safety. Grijalva has the glory of being the\r\nfirst navigator who set foot on the Mexican soil and opened an\r\nintercourse with the Aztecs.[480]\r\n\r\nOn reaching the island, he was surprised to learn that another and more\r\nformidable armament had been fitted out to follow up his own\r\ndiscoveries, and to find orders, at the same time, from the governor,\r\ncouched in no very courteous language, to repair at once to St. Jago. He\r\nwas received by that personage not merely with coldness, but with\r\nreproaches for having neglected so fair an opportunity of establishing a\r\ncolony in the country he had visited. Velasquez was one of those\r\ncaptious spirits who, when things do not go exactly to their minds, are\r\nsure to shift the responsibility of the failure from their own\r\nshoulders, where it should lie, to those of others. He had an ungenerous\r\nnature, says an old writer, credulous, and easily moved to\r\nsuspicion.[481] In the present instance it was most unmerited. Grijalva,\r\nnaturally a modest, unassuming person, had acted in obedience to the\r\ninstructions of his commander, given before sailing, and had done this\r\nin opposition to his own judgment and the importunities of his\r\nfollowers. His conduct merited anything but censure from his\r\nemployer.[482]\r\n\r\nWhen Alvarado had returned to Cuba with his golden freight, and the\r\naccounts of the rich empire of Mexico which he had gathered from the\r\nnatives, the heart of the governor swelled with rapture as he saw his\r\ndreams of avarice and ambition so likely to be realized. Impatient of\r\nthe long absence of Grijalva, he despatched a vessel in search of him\r\nunder the command of Olid, a cavalier who took an important part\r\nafterwards in the Conquest. Finally he resolved to fit out another\r\narmament on a sufficient scale to insure the subjugation of the country.\r\n\r\nHe previously solicited authority for this from the Hieronymite\r\ncommission in St. Domingo. He then despatched his chaplain to Spain with\r\nthe royal share of the gold brought from Mexico, and a full account of\r\nthe intelligence gleaned there. He set forth his own manifold services,\r\nand solicited from the court full powers to go on with the conquest and\r\ncolonization of the newly-discovered regions.[483] Before receiving an\r\nanswer, he began his preparations for the armament, and, first of all,\r\nendeavored to find a suitable person to share the expense of it and to\r\ntake the command. Such a person he found, after some difficulty and\r\ndelay, in Hernando Cortés; the man of all others best calculated to\r\nachieve this great enterprise,--the last man to whom Velasquez, could he\r\nhave foreseen the results, would have confided it.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PORTRAIT OF HERNANDO CORTÉS]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Goupil & Cº Paris_]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II\r\n\r\n     HERNANDO CORTÉS--HIS EARLY LIFE--VISITS THE NEW WORLD--HIS\r\n     RESIDENCE IN CUBA--DIFFICULTIES WITH VELASQUEZ--ARMADA INTRUSTED TO\r\n     CORTÉS\r\n\r\n1518\r\n\r\n\r\nHernando Cortés was born at Medellin, a town in the southeast corner of\r\nEstremadura,[484] in 1485.[485] He came of an ancient and respectable\r\nfamily; and historians have gratified the national vanity by tracing it\r\nup to the Lombard kings, whose descendants crossed the Pyrenees and\r\nestablished themselves in Aragon under the Gothic monarchy.[486] This\r\nroyal genealogy was not found out till Cortés had acquired a name which\r\nwould confer distinction on any descent, however noble. His father,\r\nMartin Cortés de Monroy, was a captain of infantry, in moderate\r\ncircumstances, but a man of unblemished honor; and both he and his wife,\r\nDoña Catalina Pizarro Altamirano, appear to have been much regarded for\r\ntheir excellent qualities.[487]\r\n\r\nIn his infancy Cortés is said to have had a feeble constitution, which\r\nstrengthened as he grew older.[488] At fourteen, he was sent to\r\nSalamanca, as his father, who conceived great hopes from his quick and\r\nshowy parts, proposed to educate him for the law, a profession which\r\nheld out better inducements to the young aspirant than any other. The\r\nson, however, did not conform to these views. He showed little fondness\r\nfor books, and, after loitering away two years at college, returned\r\nhome, to the great chagrin of his parents. Yet his time had not been\r\nwholly misspent, since he had laid up a little store of Latin, and\r\nlearned to write good prose, and even verses “of some estimation,\r\nconsidering”--as an old writer quaintly remarks--“Cortés as the\r\nauthor.”[489] He now passed his days in the idle, unprofitable manner of\r\none who, too wilful to be guided by others, proposes no object to\r\nhimself. His buoyant spirits were continually breaking out in\r\ntroublesome frolics and capricious humors, quite at variance with the\r\norderly habits of his father’s household. He showed a particular\r\ninclination for the military profession, or rather for the life of\r\nadventure to which in those days it was sure to lead. And when, at the\r\nage of seventeen, he proposed to enroll himself under the banners of the\r\nGreat Captain, his parents, probably thinking a life of hardship and\r\nhazard abroad preferable to one of idleness at home, made no objection.\r\n\r\nThe youthful cavalier, however, hesitated whether to seek his fortunes\r\nunder that victorious chief, or in the New World, where gold as well as\r\nglory was to be won, and where the very dangers had a mystery and\r\nromance in them inexpressibly fascinating to a youthful fancy. It was in\r\nthis direction, accordingly, that the hot spirits of that day found a\r\nvent, especially from that part of the country where Cortés lived, the\r\nneighborhood of Seville and Cadiz, the focus of nautical enterprise. He\r\ndecided on this latter course, and an opportunity offered in the\r\nsplendid armament fitted out under Don Nicolas de Ovando, successor to\r\nColumbus. An unlucky accident defeated the purpose of Cortés.[490]\r\n\r\nAs he was scaling a high wall, one night, which gave him access to the\r\napartment of a lady with whom he was engaged in an intrigue, the stones\r\ngave way, and he was thrown down with much violence and buried under the\r\nruins. A severe contusion, though attended with no other serious\r\nconsequences, confined him to his bed till after the departure of the\r\nfleet.[491]\r\n\r\nTwo years longer he remained at home, profiting little, as it would\r\nseem, from the lesson he had received. At length he availed himself of\r\nanother opportunity presented by the departure of a small squadron of\r\nvessels bound to the Indian islands. He was nineteen years of age when\r\nhe bade adieu to his native shores in 1504,--the same year in which\r\nSpain lost the best and greatest in her long line of princes, Isabella\r\nthe Catholic.\r\n\r\nThe vessel in which Cortés sailed was commanded by one Alonso Quintero.\r\nThe fleet touched at the Canaries, as was common in the outward passage.\r\nWhile the other vessels were detained there taking in supplies, Quintero\r\nsecretly stole out by night from the islands, with the design of\r\nreaching Hispaniola and securing the market before the arrival of his\r\ncompanions. A furious storm which he encountered, however, dismasted\r\nhis ship, and he was obliged to return to port and refit. The convoy\r\nconsented to wait for their unworthy partner, and after a short\r\ndetention they all sailed in company again. But the faithless Quintero,\r\nas they drew near the islands, availed himself once more of the darkness\r\nof the night, to leave the squadron with the same purpose as before.\r\nUnluckily for him, he met with a succession of heavy gales and\r\nhead-winds, which drove him from his course, and he wholly lost his\r\nreckoning. For many days the vessel was tossed about, and all on board\r\nwere filled with apprehensions, and no little indignation against the\r\nauthor of their calamities. At length they were cheered one morning with\r\nthe sight of a white dove, which, wearied by its flight, lighted on the\r\ntopmast. The biographers of Cortés speak of it as a miracle.[492]\r\nFortunately it was no miracle, but a very natural occurrence, showing\r\nincontestably that they were near land. In a short time, by taking the\r\ndirection of the bird’s flight, they reached the island of Hispaniola;\r\nand, on coming into port, the worthy master had the satisfaction to find\r\nhis companions arrived before him, and their cargoes already sold.[493]\r\n\r\nImmediately on landing, Cortés repaired to the house of the governor, to\r\nwhom he had been personally known in Spain. Ovando was absent on an\r\nexpedition into the interior, but the young man was kindly received by\r\nthe secretary, who assured him there would be no doubt of his obtaining\r\na liberal grant of land to settle on. “But I came to get gold,” replied\r\nCortés, “not to till the soil, like a peasant.”\r\n\r\nOn the governor’s return, Cortés consented to give up his roving\r\nthoughts, at least for a time, as the other labored to convince him that\r\nhe would be more likely to realize his wishes from the slow, indeed, but\r\nsure, returns of husbandry, where the soil and the laborers were a free\r\ngift to the planter, than by taking his chance in the lottery of\r\nadventure, in which there were so many blanks to a prize. He accordingly\r\nreceived a grant of land, with a _repartimiento_ of Indians, and was\r\nappointed notary of the town or settlement of Açua. His graver pursuits,\r\nhowever, did not prevent his indulgence of the amorous propensities\r\nwhich belong to the sunny clime where he was born; and this frequently\r\ninvolved him in affairs of honor, from which, though an expert\r\nswordsman, he carried away scars that accompanied him to his grave.[494]\r\nHe occasionally, moreover, found the means of breaking up the monotony\r\nof his way of life by engaging in the military expeditions which, under\r\nthe command of Ovando’s lieutenant, Diego Velasquez, were employed to\r\nsuppress the insurrections of the natives. In this school the young\r\nadventurer first studied the wild tactics of Indian warfare; he became\r\nfamiliar with toil and danger, and with those deeds of cruelty which\r\nhave too often, alas! stained the bright scutcheons of the Castilian\r\nchivalry in the New World. He was only prevented by illness--a most\r\nfortunate one, on this occasion--from embarking in Nicuessa’s\r\nexpedition, which furnished a tale of woe not often matched in the\r\nannals of Spanish discovery. Providence reserved him for higher ends.\r\n\r\nAt length, in 1511, when Velasquez undertook the conquest of Cuba,\r\nCortés willingly abandoned his quiet life for the stirring scenes there\r\nopened, and took part in the expedition. He displayed, throughout the\r\ninvasion, an activity and courage that won him the approbation of the\r\ncommander; while his free and cordial manners, his good humor and lively\r\nsallies of wit, made him the favorite of the soldiers. “He gave little\r\nevidence,” says a contemporary, “of the great qualities which he\r\nafterwards showed.” It is probable these qualities were not known to\r\nhimself; while to a common observer his careless manners and jocund\r\nrepartees might well seem incompatible with anything serious or\r\nprofound; as the real depth of the current is not suspected under the\r\nlight play and sunny sparkling of the surface.[495]\r\n\r\nAfter the reduction of the island, Cortés seems to have been held in\r\ngreat favor by Velasquez, now appointed its governor. According to Las\r\nCasas, he was made one of his secretaries.[496] He still retained the\r\nsame fondness for gallantry, for which his handsome person afforded\r\nobvious advantages, but which had more than once brought him into\r\ntrouble in earlier life. Among the families who had taken up their\r\nresidence in Cuba was one of the name of Xuarez, from Granada in Old\r\nSpain. It consisted of a brother, and four sisters remarkable for their\r\nbeauty. With one of them, named Catalina, the susceptible heart of the\r\nyoung soldier became enamored.[497] How far the intimacy was carried is\r\nnot quite certain. But it appears he gave his promise to marry her,--a\r\npromise which, when the time came, and reason, it may be, had got the\r\nbetter of passion, he showed no alacrity in keeping. He resisted,\r\nindeed, all remonstrances to this effect, from the lady’s family, backed\r\nby the governor, and somewhat sharpened, no doubt, in the latter by the\r\nparticular interest he took in one of the fair sisters, who is said not\r\nto have repaid it with ingratitude.\r\n\r\nWhether the rebuke of Velasquez or some other cause of disgust rankled\r\nin the breast of Cortés, he now became cold towards his patron, and\r\nconnected himself with a disaffected party tolerably numerous in the\r\nisland. They were in the habit of meeting at his house and brooding over\r\ntheir causes of discontent, chiefly founded, it would appear, on what\r\nthey conceived an ill requital of their services in the distribution of\r\nlands and offices. It may well be imagined that it could have been no\r\neasy task for the ruler of one of these colonies, however discreet and\r\nwell intentioned, to satisfy the indefinite cravings of speculators and\r\nadventurers, who swarmed, like so many famished harpies, in the track of\r\ndiscovery in the New World.[498]\r\n\r\nThe malecontents determined to lay their grievances before the higher\r\nauthorities in Hispaniola, from whom Velasquez had received his\r\ncommission. The voyage was one of some hazard, as it was to be made in\r\nan open boat, across an arm of the sea eighteen leagues wide; and they\r\nfixed on Cortés, with whose fearless spirit they were well acquainted,\r\nas the fittest man to undertake it. The conspiracy got wind, and came to\r\nthe governor’s ears before the departure of the envoy, whom he instantly\r\ncaused to be seized, loaded with fetters, and placed in strict\r\nconfinement. It is even said he would have hung him, but for the\r\ninterposition of his friends.[499] The fact is not incredible. The\r\ngovernors of these little territories, having entire control over the\r\nfortunes of their subjects, enjoyed an authority far more despotic than\r\nthat of the sovereign himself. They were generally men of rank and\r\npersonal consideration; their distance from the mother-country withdrew\r\ntheir conduct from searching scrutiny, and, when that did occur, they\r\nusually had interest and means of corruption at command sufficient to\r\nshield them from punishment. The Spanish colonial history, in its\r\nearlier stages, affords striking instances of the extraordinary\r\nassumption and abuse of powers by these petty potentates; and the sad\r\nfate of Vasquez Nuñez de Balboa, the illustrious discoverer of the\r\nPacific, though the most signal, is by no means a solitary example, that\r\nthe greatest services could be requited by persecution and an\r\nignominious death.\r\n\r\nThe governor of Cuba, however, although irascible and suspicious in his\r\nnature, does not seem to have been vindictive, nor particularly cruel.\r\nIn the present instance, indeed, it may well be doubted whether the\r\nblame would not be more reasonably charged on the unfounded expectations\r\nof his followers than on himself.\r\n\r\nCortés did not long remain in durance. He contrived to throw back one of\r\nthe bolts of his fetters, and, after extricating his limbs, succeeded in\r\nforcing open a window with the irons so as to admit of his escape. He\r\nwas lodged on the second floor of the building, and was able to let\r\nhimself down to the pavement without injury, and unobserved. He then\r\nmade the best of his way to a neighboring church, where he claimed the\r\nprivilege of sanctuary.\r\n\r\nVelasquez, though incensed at his escape, was afraid to violate the\r\nsanctity of the place by employing force. But he stationed a guard in\r\nthe neighborhood, with orders to seize the fugitive if he should forget\r\nhimself so far as to leave the sanctuary. In a few days this happened.\r\nAs Cortés was carelessly standing without the walls in front of the\r\nbuilding, an _alguacil_ suddenly sprang on him from behind and pinioned\r\nhis arms, while others rushed in and secured him. This man, whose name\r\nwas Juan Escudero, was afterwards hung by Cortés for some offence in New\r\nSpain.[500]\r\n\r\nThe unlucky prisoner was again put in irons, and carried on board a\r\nvessel to sail the next morning for Hispaniola, there to undergo his\r\ntrial. Fortune favored him once more. He succeeded, after much\r\ndifficulty and no little pain, in passing his feet through the rings\r\nwhich shackled them. He then came cautiously on deck, and, covered by\r\nthe darkness of the night, stole quietly down the side of the ship into\r\na boat that lay floating below. He pushed off from the vessel with as\r\nlittle noise as possible. As he drew near the shore, the stream became\r\nrapid and turbulent. He hesitated to trust his boat to it, and, as he\r\nwas an excellent swimmer, prepared to breast it himself, and boldly\r\nplunged into the water. The current was strong, but the arm of a man\r\nstruggling for life was stronger; and, after buffeting the waves till he\r\nwas nearly exhausted, he succeeded in gaining a landing; when he sought\r\nrefuge in the same sanctuary which had protected him before. The\r\nfacility with which Cortés a second time effected his escape may lead\r\none to doubt the fidelity of his guards; who perhaps looked on him as\r\nthe victim of persecution, and felt the influence of those popular\r\nmanners which seem to have gained him friends in every society into\r\nwhich he was thrown.[501]\r\n\r\nFor some reason not explained,--perhaps from policy,--he now\r\nrelinquished his objections to the marriage with Catalina Xuarez. He\r\nthus secured the good offices of her family. Soon afterwards the\r\ngovernor himself relented, and became reconciled to his unfortunate\r\nenemy. A strange story is told in connection with this event. It is said\r\nhis proud spirit refused to accept the proffers of reconciliation made\r\nhim by Velasquez; and that one evening, leaving the sanctuary, he\r\npresented himself unexpectedly before the latter in his own quarters,\r\nwhen on a military excursion at some distance from the capital. The\r\ngovernor, startled by the sudden apparition of his enemy completely\r\narmed before him, with some dismay inquired the meaning of it. Cortés\r\nanswered by insisting on a full explanation of his previous conduct.\r\nAfter some hot discussion the interview terminated amicably; the parties\r\nembraced, and, when a messenger arrived to announce the escape of\r\nCortés, he found him in the apartments of his Excellency, where, having\r\nretired to rest, both were actually sleeping in the same bed! The\r\nanecdote is repeated without distrust by more than one biographer of\r\nCortés.[502] It is not very probable, however, that a haughty,\r\nirascible man like Velasquez should have given such uncommon proofs of\r\ncondescension and familiarity to one, so far beneath him in station,\r\nwith whom he had been so recently in deadly feud; nor, on the other\r\nhand, that Cortés should have had the silly temerity to brave the lion\r\nin his den, where a single nod would have sent him to the gibbet,--and\r\nthat, too, with as little compunction or fear of consequences as would\r\nhave attended the execution of an Indian slave.[503]\r\n\r\nThe reconciliation with the governor, however brought about, was\r\npermanent. Cortés, though not re-established in the office of secretary,\r\nreceived a liberal _repartimiento_ of Indians, and an ample territory in\r\nthe neighborhood of St. Jago, of which he was soon after made _alcalde_.\r\nHe now lived almost wholly on his estate, devoting himself to\r\nagriculture with more zeal than formerly. He stocked his plantation with\r\ndifferent kinds of cattle, some of which were first introduced by him\r\ninto Cuba.[504] He wrought, also, the gold-mines which fell to his\r\nshare, and which in this island promised better returns than those in\r\nHispaniola. By this course of industry he found himself, in a few years,\r\nmaster of some two or three thousand _castellanos_, a large sum for one\r\nin his situation. “God, who alone knows at what cost of Indian lives it\r\nwas obtained,” exclaims Las Casas, “will take account of it!”[505] His\r\ndays glided smoothly away in these tranquil pursuits, and in the society\r\nof his beautiful wife, who, however ineligible as a connection, from the\r\ninferiority of her condition, appears to have fulfilled all the\r\nrelations of a faithful and affectionate partner. Indeed, he was often\r\nheard to say at this time, as the good bishop above quoted remarks,\r\n“that he lived as happily with her as if she had been the daughter of a\r\nduchess.” Fortune gave him the means in after-life of verifying the\r\ntruth of his assertion.[506]\r\n\r\nSuch was the state of things, when Alvarado returned with the tidings of\r\nGrijalva’s discoveries and the rich fruits of his traffic with the\r\nnatives. The news spread like wildfire throughout the island; for all\r\nsaw in it the promise of more important results than any hitherto\r\nobtained. The governor, as already noticed, resolved to follow up the\r\ntrack of discovery with a more considerable armament; and he looked\r\naround for a proper person to share the expense of it and to take the\r\ncommand.\r\n\r\nSeveral hidalgos presented themselves, whom, from want of proper\r\nqualifications, or from his distrust of their assuming an independence\r\nof their employer, he, one after another, rejected. There were two\r\npersons in St. Jago in whom he placed great confidence,--Amador de\r\nLares, the _contador_, or royal treasurer,[507] and his own secretary,\r\nAndres de Duero. Cortés was also in close intimacy with both these\r\npersons; and he availed himself of it to prevail on them to recommend\r\nhim as a suitable person to be intrusted with the expedition. It is said\r\nhe reinforced the proposal by promising a liberal share of the proceeds\r\nof it. However this may be, the parties urged his selection by the\r\ngovernor with all the eloquence of which they were capable. That officer\r\nhad had ample experience of the capacity and courage of the candidate.\r\nHe knew, too, that he had acquired a fortune which would enable him to\r\nco-operate materially in fitting out the armament. His popularity in the\r\nisland would speedily attract followers to his standard.[508] All past\r\nanimosities had long since been buried in oblivion, and the confidence\r\nhe was now to repose in him would insure his fidelity and gratitude. He\r\nlent a willing ear, therefore, to the recommendation of his counsellors,\r\nand, sending for Cortés, announced his purpose of making him\r\nCaptain-General of the Armada.[509]\r\n\r\nCortés had now attained the object of his wishes,--the object for which\r\nhis soul had panted ever since he had set foot in the New World. He was\r\nno longer to be condemned to a life of mercenary drudgery, nor to be\r\ncooped up within the precincts of a petty island; but he was to be\r\nplaced on a new and independent theatre of action, and a boundless\r\nprospective was opened to his view, which might satisfy not merely the\r\nwildest cravings of avarice, but, to a bold, aspiring spirit like his,\r\nthe far more importunate cravings of ambition. He fully appreciated the\r\nimportance of the late discoveries, and read in them the existence of\r\nthe great empire in the far West, dark hints of which had floated, from\r\ntime to time, to the Islands, and of which more certain glimpses had\r\nbeen caught by those who had reached the continent. This was the country\r\nintimated to the “Great Admiral” in his visit to Honduras in 1502, and\r\nwhich he might have reached had he held on a northern course, instead of\r\nstriking to the south in quest of an imaginary strait. As it was, “he\r\nhad but opened the gate,” to use his own bitter expression, “for others\r\nto enter.” The time had at length come when they were to enter it; and\r\nthe young adventurer, whose magic lance was to dissolve the spell which\r\nhad so long hung over these mysterious regions, now stood ready to\r\nassume the enterprise.\r\n\r\nFrom this hour the deportment of Cortés seemed to undergo a change. His\r\nthoughts, instead of evaporating in empty levities or idle flashes of\r\nmerriment, were wholly concentrated on the great object to which he was\r\ndevoted. His elastic spirits were shown in cheering and stimulating the\r\ncompanions of his toilsome duties, and he was roused to a generous\r\nenthusiasm, of which even those who knew him best had not conceived him\r\ncapable. He applied at once all the money in his possession to fitting\r\nout the armament. He raised more by the mortgage of his estates, and by\r\ngiving his obligations to some wealthy merchants of the place, who\r\nrelied for their reimbursement on the success of the expedition; and,\r\nwhen his own credit was exhausted, he availed himself of that of his\r\nfriends.\r\n\r\nThe funds thus acquired he expended in the purchase of vessels,\r\nprovisions, and military stores, while he invited recruits by offers of\r\nassistance to such as were too poor to provide for themselves, and by\r\nthe additional promise of a liberal share of the anticipated\r\nprofits.[510]\r\n\r\nAll was now bustle and excitement in the little town of St. Jago. Some\r\nwere busy in refitting the vessels and getting them ready for the\r\nvoyage; some in providing naval stores; others in converting their own\r\nestates into money in order to equip themselves; every one seemed\r\nanxious to contribute in some way or other to the success of the\r\nexpedition. Six ships, some of them of a large size, had already been\r\nprocured; and three hundred recruits enrolled themselves in the course\r\nof a few days, eager to seek their fortunes under the banner of this\r\ndaring and popular chieftain.\r\n\r\nHow far the governor contributed towards the expenses of the outfit is\r\nnot very clear. If the friends of Cortés are to be believed, nearly the\r\nwhole burden fell on him; since, while he supplied the squadron without\r\nremuneration, the governor sold many of his own stores at an exorbitant\r\nprofit.[511] Yet it does not seem probable that Velasquez, with such\r\nample means at his command, should have thrown on his deputy the burden\r\nof the expedition, nor that the latter--had he done so--could have been\r\nin a condition to meet these expenses, amounting, as we are told, to\r\nmore than twenty thousand gold ducats. Still it cannot be denied that an\r\nambitious man like Cortés, who was to reap all the glory of the\r\nenterprise, would very naturally be less solicitous to count the gains\r\nof it, than his employer, who, inactive at home, and having no laurels\r\nto win, must look on the pecuniary profits as his only recompense. The\r\nquestion gave rise, some years later, to a furious litigation between\r\nthe parties, with which it is not necessary at present to embarrass the\r\nreader.\r\n\r\nIt is due to Velasquez to state that the instructions delivered by him\r\nfor the conduct of the expedition cannot be charged with a narrow or\r\nmercenary spirit. The first object of the voyage was to find Grijaiva,\r\nafter which the two commanders were to proceed in company together.\r\nReports had been brought back by Cordova, on his return from the first\r\nvisit to Yucatan, that six Christians were said to be lingering in\r\ncaptivity in the interior of the country. It was supposed they might\r\nbelong to the party of the unfortunate Nicuessa, and orders were given\r\nto find them out, if possible, and restore them to liberty. But the\r\ngreat object of the expedition was barter with the natives. In pursuing\r\nthis, special care was to be taken that they should receive no wrong,\r\nbut be treated with kindness and humanity. Cortés was to bear in mind,\r\nabove all things, that the object which the Spanish monarch had most at\r\nheart was the conversion of the Indians. He was to impress on them the\r\ngrandeur and goodness of his royal master, to invite them “to give in\r\ntheir allegiance to him, and to manifest it by regaling him with such\r\ncomfortable presents of gold, pearls, and precious stones as, by showing\r\ntheir own good will, would secure his favor and protection.” He was to\r\nmake an accurate survey of the coast, sounding its bays and inlets for\r\nthe benefit of future navigators. He was to acquaint himself with the\r\nnatural products of the country, with the character of its different\r\nraces, their institutions and progress in civilization; and he was to\r\nsend home minute accounts of all these, together with such articles as\r\nhe should obtain in his intercourse with them. Finally, he was to take\r\n_the most careful care_ to omit nothing that might redound to the\r\nservice of God or his sovereign.[512]\r\n\r\nSuch was the general tenor of the instructions given to Cortés; and they\r\nmust be admitted to provide for the interests of science and humanity,\r\nas well as for those which had reference only to a commercial\r\nspeculation. It may seem strange, considering the discontent shown by\r\nVelasquez with his former captain, Grijalva, for not colonizing, that no\r\ndirections should have been given to that effect here. But he had not\r\nyet received from Spain the warrant for investing his agents with such\r\npowers; and that which had been obtained from the Hieronymite fathers in\r\nHispaniola conceded only the right to traffic with the natives. The\r\ncommission at the same time recognized the authority of Cortés as\r\nCaptain-General of the expedition.[513]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III\r\n\r\n     JEALOUSY OF VELASQUEZ--CORTÉS EMBARKS--EQUIPMENT OF HIS FLEET--HIS\r\n     PERSON AND CHARACTER--RENDEZVOUS AT HAVANA--STRENGTH OF HIS\r\n     ARMAMENT\r\n\r\n\r\n1519\r\n\r\nThe importance given to Cortés by his new position, and, perhaps, a\r\nsomewhat more lofty bearing, gradually gave uneasiness to the naturally\r\nsuspicious temper of Velasquez, who became apprehensive that his\r\nofficer, when away where he would have the power, might also have the\r\ninclination, to throw off his dependence on him altogether. An\r\naccidental circumstance at this time heightened these suspicions. A mad\r\nfellow, his jester, one of those crack-brained wits--half wit, half\r\nfool--who formed in those days a common appendage to every great man’s\r\nestablishment, called out to the governor, as he was taking his usual\r\nwalk one morning with Cortés towards the port, “Have a care, master\r\nVelasquez, or we shall have to go a-hunting, some day or other, after\r\nthis same captain of ours!” “Do you hear what the rogue says?” exclaimed\r\nthe governor to his companion. “Do not heed him,” said Cortés: “he is a\r\nsaucy knave, and deserves a good whipping.” The words sank deep,\r\nhowever, in the mind of Velasquez,--as, indeed, true jests are apt to\r\nstick.\r\n\r\nThere were not wanting persons about his Excellency who fanned the\r\nlatent embers of jealousy into a blaze. These worthy gentlemen, some of\r\nthem kinsmen of Velasquez, who probably felt their own deserts somewhat\r\nthrown into the shade by the rising fortunes of Cortés, reminded the\r\ngovernor of his ancient quarrel with that officer, and of the little\r\nprobability that affronts so keenly felt at the time could ever be\r\nforgotten. By these and similar suggestions, and by misconstructions of\r\nthe present conduct of Cortés, they wrought on the passions of Velasquez\r\nto such a degree that he resolved to intrust the expedition to other\r\nhands.[514]\r\n\r\nHe communicated his design to his confidential advisers, Lares and\r\nDuero, and these trusty personages reported it without delay to Cortés,\r\nalthough, “to a man of half his penetration,” says Las Casas, “the thing\r\nwould have been readily divined from the governor’s altered\r\ndemeanor.”[515] The two functionaries advised their friend to expedite\r\nmatters as much as possible, and to lose no time in getting his fleet\r\nready for sea, if he would retain the command of it. Cortés showed the\r\nsame prompt decision on this occasion which more than once afterwards\r\nin a similar crisis gave the direction to his destiny.\r\n\r\nHe had not yet got his complement of men, nor of vessels, and was very\r\ninadequately provided with supplies of any kind. But he resolved to\r\nweigh anchor that very night. He waited on his officers, informed them\r\nof his purpose, and probably of the cause of it; and at midnight, when\r\nthe town was hushed in sleep, they all went quietly on board, and the\r\nlittle squadron dropped down the bay. First, however, Cortés had visited\r\nthe person whose business it was to supply the place with meat, and\r\nrelieved him of all his stock on hand, notwithstanding his complaint\r\nthat the city must suffer for it on the morrow, leaving him, at the same\r\ntime, in payment, a massive gold chain of much value, which he wore\r\nround his neck.[516]\r\n\r\nGreat was the amazement of the good citizens of St. Jago when, at dawn,\r\nthey saw that the fleet, which they knew was so ill prepared for the\r\nvoyage, had left its moorings and was busily getting under way. The\r\ntidings soon came to the ears of his Excellency, who, springing from his\r\nbed, hastily dressed himself, mounted his horse, and, followed by his\r\nretinue, galloped down to the quay. Cortés, as soon as he descried their\r\napproach, entered an armed boat, and came within speaking-distance of\r\nthe shore. “And is it thus you part from me?” exclaimed Velasquez; “a\r\ncourteous way of taking leave, truly!” “Pardon me,” answered Cortés;\r\n“time presses, and there are some things that should be done before they\r\nare even thought of. Has your Excellency any commands?” But the\r\nmortified governor had no commands to give; and Cortés, politely waving\r\nhis hand, returned to his vessel, and the little fleet instantly made\r\nsail for the port of Macaca, about fifteen leagues distant. (November\r\n18, 1518.) Velasquez rode back to his house to digest his chagrin as he\r\nbest might; satisfied, probably, that he had made at least two\r\nblunders,--one in appointing Cortés to the command, the other in\r\nattempting to deprive him of it. For, if it be true that by giving our\r\nconfidence by halves we can scarcely hope to make a friend, it is\r\nequally true that by withdrawing it when given we shall make an\r\nenemy.[517]\r\n\r\nThis clandestine departure of Cortés has been severely criticised by\r\nsome writers, especially by Las Casas.[518] Yet much may be urged in\r\nvindication of his conduct. He had been appointed to the command by the\r\nvoluntary act of the governor, and this had been fully ratified by the\r\nauthorities of Hispaniola. He had at once devoted all his resources to\r\nthe undertaking, incurring, indeed, a heavy debt in addition. He was now\r\nto be deprived of his commission, without any misconduct having been\r\nalleged or at least proved against him. Such an event must overwhelm him\r\nin irretrievable ruin, to say nothing of the friends from whom he had so\r\nlargely borrowed, and the followers who had embarked their fortunes in\r\nthe expedition on the faith of his commanding it. There are few persons,\r\nprobably, who, under these circumstances, would have felt called tamely\r\nto acquiesce in the sacrifice of their hopes to a groundless and\r\narbitrary whim. The most to have been expected from Cortés was that he\r\nshould feel obliged to provide faithfully for the interests of his\r\nemployer in the conduct of the enterprise. How far he felt the force of\r\nthis obligation will appear in the sequel.\r\n\r\nFrom Macaca, where Cortés laid in such stores as he could obtain from\r\nthe royal farms, and which, he said, he considered as “a loan from the\r\nking,” he proceeded to Trinidad; a more considerable town, on the\r\nsouthern coast of Cuba. Here he landed, and, erecting his standard in\r\nfront of his quarters, made proclamation, with liberal offers to all who\r\nwould join the expedition. Volunteers came in daily, and among them more\r\nthan a hundred of Grijalva’s men, just returned from their voyage and\r\nwilling to follow up the discovery under an enterprising leader. The\r\nfame of Cortés attracted, also, a number of cavaliers of family and\r\ndistinction, some of whom, having accompanied Grijalva, brought much\r\ninformation valuable for the present expedition. Among these hidalgos\r\nmay be mentioned Pedro de Alvarado and his brothers, Cristóval de Olid,\r\nAlonso de Avila, Juan Velasquez de Leon, a near relation of the\r\ngovernor, Alonso Hernandez de Puertocarrero, and Gonzalo de\r\nSandoval,--all of them men who took a most important part in the\r\nConquest. Their presence was of great moment, as giving consideration to\r\nthe enterprise; and, when they entered the little camp of the\r\nadventurers, the latter turned out to welcome them amidst lively strains\r\nof music and joyous salvos of artillery.\r\n\r\nCortés meanwhile was active in purchasing military stores and\r\nprovisions. Learning that a trading-vessel laden with grain and other\r\ncommodities for the mines was off the coast, he ordered out one of his\r\ncaravels to seize her and bring her into port. He paid the master in\r\nbills for both cargo and ship, and even persuaded this man, named\r\nSedeño,[519] who was wealthy, to join his fortunes to the expedition. He\r\nalso despatched one of his officers, Diego de Ordaz, in quest of another\r\nship,[520] of which he had tidings, with instructions to seize it in\r\nlike manner, and to meet him with it off Cape St. Antonio, the westerly\r\npoint of the island.[521] By this he effected another object, that of\r\ngetting rid of Ordaz, who was one of the governor’s household, and an\r\ninconvenient spy on his own actions.\r\n\r\nWhile thus occupied, letters from Velasquez were received by the\r\ncommander of Trinidad, requiring him to seize the person of Cortés and\r\nto detain him, as he had been deposed from the command of the fleet,\r\nwhich was given to another. This functionary communicated his\r\ninstructions to the principal officers in the expedition, who counselled\r\nhim not to make the attempt, as it would undoubtedly lead to a commotion\r\namong the soldiers, that might end in laying the town in ashes. Verdugo\r\nthought it prudent to conform to this advice.[522]\r\n\r\nAs Cortés was willing to strengthen himself by still further\r\nreinforcements, he ordered Alvarado with a small body of men to march\r\nacross the country to the Havana,[523] while he himself would sail\r\nround the westerly point of the island and meet him there with the\r\nsquadron. In this port he again displayed his standard, making the usual\r\nproclamation. He caused all the large guns to be brought on shore, and,\r\nwith the small arms and cross-bows, to be put in order. As there was\r\nabundance of cotton raised in this neighborhood, he had the jackets of\r\nthe soldiers thickly quilted with it, for a defence against the Indian\r\narrows, from which the troops in the former expeditions had grievously\r\nsuffered. He distributed his men into eleven companies, each under the\r\ncommand of an experienced officer; and it was observed that, although\r\nseveral of the cavaliers in the service were the personal friends and\r\neven kinsmen of Velasquez, he appeared to treat them all with perfect\r\nconfidence.\r\n\r\nHis principal standard was of black velvet, embroidered with gold, and\r\nemblazoned with a red cross amidst flames of blue and white, with this\r\nmotto in Latin beneath: “Friends, let us follow the Cross; and under\r\nthis sign, if we have faith, we shall conquer.” He now assumed more\r\nstate in his own person and way of living, introducing a greater number\r\nof domestics and officers into his household, and placing it on a\r\nfooting becoming a man of high station. This state he maintained through\r\nthe rest of his life.[524]\r\n\r\nCortés at this time was thirty-three, or perhaps thirty-four, years of\r\nage. In stature he was rather above the middle size. His complexion was\r\npale; and his large dark eye gave an expression of gravity to his\r\ncountenance, not to have been expected in one of his cheerful\r\ntemperament. His figure was slender, at least until later life; but his\r\nchest was deep, his shoulders broad, his frame muscular and well\r\nproportioned. It presented the union of agility and vigor which\r\nqualified him to excel in fencing, horsemanship, and the other generous\r\nexercises of chivalry. In his diet he was temperate, careless of what he\r\nate, and drinking little; while to toil and privation he seemed\r\nperfectly indifferent. His dress, for he did not disdain the impression\r\nproduced by such adventitious aids, was such as to set off his handsome\r\nperson to advantage; neither gaudy nor striking, but rich. He wore few\r\nornaments, and usually the same; but those were of great price. His\r\nmanners, frank and soldier-like, concealed a most cool and calculating\r\nspirit. With his gayest humor there mingled a settled air of resolution,\r\nwhich made those who approached him feel they must obey, and which\r\ninfused something like awe into the attachment of his most devoted\r\nfollowers. Such a combination, in which love was tempered by authority,\r\nwas the one probably best calculated to inspire devotion in the rough\r\nand turbulent spirits among whom his lot was to be cast.\r\n\r\nThe character of Cortés seems to have undergone some change with change\r\nof circumstances; or, to speak more correctly, the new scenes in which\r\nhe was placed called forth qualities which before lay dormant in his\r\nbosom. There are some hardy natures that require the heats of excited\r\naction to unfold their energies; like the plants which, closed to the\r\nmild influence of a temperate latitude, come to their full growth, and\r\ngive forth their fruits, only in the burning atmosphere of the tropics.\r\nSuch is the portrait left to us by his contemporaries of this remarkable\r\nman; the instrument selected by Providence to scatter terror among the\r\nbarbarian monarchs of the Western World, and lay their empires in the\r\ndust.[525]\r\n\r\nBefore the preparations were fully completed at the Havana, the\r\ncommander of the place, Don Pedro Barba, received despatches from\r\nVelasquez ordering him to apprehend Cortés and to prevent the departure\r\nof his vessels; while another epistle from the same source was delivered\r\nto Cortés himself, requesting him to postpone his voyage till the\r\ngovernor could communicate with him, as he proposed, in person. “Never,”\r\nexclaims Las Casas, “did I see so little knowledge of affairs shown, as\r\nin this letter of Diego Velasquez,--that he should have imagined that a\r\nman who had so recently put such an affront on him would defer his\r\ndeparture at his bidding!”[526] It was, indeed, hoping to stay the\r\nflight of the arrow by a word, after it had left the bow.\r\n\r\nThe Captain-General, however, during his short stay, had entirely\r\nconciliated the good will of Barba. And, if that officer had had the\r\ninclination, he knew he had not the power, to enforce his principal’s\r\norders, in the face of a resolute soldiery, incensed at this ungenerous\r\npersecution of their commander, and “all of whom,” in the words of the\r\nhonest chronicler who bore part in the expedition, “officers and\r\nprivates, would have cheerfully laid down their lives for him.”[527]\r\nBarba contented himself, therefore, with explaining to Velasquez the\r\nimpracticability of the attempt, and at the same time endeavored to\r\ntranquillize his apprehensions by asserting his own confidence in the\r\nfidelity of Cortés. To this the latter added a communication of his own,\r\ncouched “in the soft terms he knew so well how to use,”[528] in which he\r\nimplored his Excellency to rely on his devotion to his interests, and\r\nconcluded with the comfortable assurance that he and the whole fleet,\r\nGod willing, would sail on the following morning.\r\n\r\nAccordingly, on the 10th of February, 1519, the little squadron got\r\nunder way, and directed its course towards Cape St. Antonio, the\r\nappointed place of rendezvous. When all were brought together, the\r\nvessels were found to be eleven in number; one of them, in which Cortés\r\nhimself went, was of a hundred tons’ burden, three others were from\r\nseventy to eighty tons; the remainder were caravels and open\r\nbrigantines. The whole was put under the direction of Antonio de\r\nAlaminos, as chief pilot; a veteran navigator, who had acted as pilot to\r\nColumbus in his last voyage, and to Cordova and Grijalva in the former\r\nexpeditions to Yucatan.\r\n\r\nLanding on the Cape and mustering his forces, Cortés found they amounted\r\nto one hundred and ten mariners, five hundred and fifty-three soldiers,\r\nincluding thirty-two crossbowmen, and thirteen arquebusiers, besides two\r\nhundred Indians of the island, and a few Indian women for menial\r\noffices. He was provided with ten heavy guns, four lighter pieces called\r\nfalconets, and with a good supply of ammunition.[529] He had besides\r\nsixteen horses. They were not easily procured; for the difficulty of\r\ntransporting them across the ocean in the flimsy craft of that day made\r\nthem rare and incredibly dear in the Islands.[530] But Cortés rightfully\r\nestimated the importance of cavalry, however small in number, both for\r\ntheir actual service in the field, and for striking terror into the\r\nsavages. With so paltry a force did he enter on a conquest which even\r\nhis stout heart must have shrunk from attempting with such means, had he\r\nbut foreseen half its real difficulties!\r\n\r\nBefore embarking, Cortés addressed his soldiers in a short but animated\r\nharangue. He told them they were about to enter on a noble enterprise,\r\none that would make their name famous to after-ages. He was leading them\r\nto countries more vast and opulent than any yet visited by Europeans. “I\r\nhold out to you a glorious prize,” continued the orator, “but it is to\r\nbe won by incessant toil. Great things are achieved only by great\r\nexertions, and glory was never the reward of sloth.[531] If I have\r\nlabored hard and staked my all on this undertaking, it is for the love\r\nof that renown which is the noblest recompense of man. But, if any among\r\nyou covet riches more, be but true to me, as I will be true to you and\r\nto the occasion, and I will make you masters of such as our countrymen\r\nhave never dreamed of! You are few in number, but strong in resolution;\r\nand, if this does not falter, doubt not but that the Almighty, who has\r\nnever deserted the Spaniard in his contest with the infidel, will\r\nshield you, though encompassed by a cloud of enemies; for your cause is\r\na _just cause_, and you are to fight under the banner of the Cross. Go\r\nforward, then,” he concluded, “with alacrity and confidence, and carry\r\nto a glorious issue the work so auspiciously begun.”[532]\r\n\r\nThe rough eloquence of the general, touching the various chords of\r\nambition, avarice, and religious zeal, sent a thrill through the bosoms\r\nof his martial audience; and, receiving it with acclamations, they\r\nseemed eager to press forward under a chief who was to lead them not so\r\nmuch to battle, as to triumph.\r\n\r\nCortés was well satisfied to find his own enthusiasm so largely shared\r\nby his followers. Mass was then celebrated with the solemnities usual\r\nwith the Spanish navigators when entering on their voyages of discovery.\r\nThe fleet was placed under the immediate protection of St. Peter, the\r\npatron saint of Cortés, and, weighing anchor, took its departure on the\r\neighteenth day of February, 1519, for the coast of Yucatan.[533]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IV\r\n\r\n     VOYAGE TO COZUMEL--CONVERSION OF THE NATIVES--GERÓNIMO DE\r\n     AGUILAR--ARMY ARRIVES AT TABASCO--GREAT BATTLE WITH THE\r\n     INDIANS--CHRISTIANITY INTRODUCED\r\n\r\n1519\r\n\r\n\r\nOrders were given for the vessels to keep as near together as possible,\r\nand to take the direction of the _capitanía_, or admiral’s ship, which\r\ncarried a beacon-light in the stern during the night. But the weather,\r\nwhich had been favorable, changed soon after their departure, and one of\r\nthose tempests set in which at this season are often found in the\r\nlatitudes of the West Indies. It fell with terrible force on the little\r\nnavy, scattering it far asunder, dismantling some of the ships, and\r\ndriving them all considerably south of their proposed destination.\r\n\r\nCortés, who had lingered behind to convoy a disabled vessel, reached the\r\nisland of Cozumel last. On landing, he learned that one of his captains,\r\nPedro de Alvarado, had availed himself of the short time he had been\r\nthere, to enter the temples, rifle them of their few ornaments, and, by\r\nhis violent conduct, so far to terrify the simple natives that they had\r\nfled for refuge into the interior of the island. Cortés, highly incensed\r\nat these rash proceedings, so contrary to the policy he had proposed,\r\ncould not refrain from severely reprimanding his officer in the presence\r\nof the army. He commanded two Indian captives, taken by Alvarado, to be\r\nbrought before him, and explained to them the pacific purpose of his\r\nvisit. This he did through the assistance of his interpreter,\r\nMelchorejo, a native of Yucatan, who had been brought back by Grijalva,\r\nand who during his residence in Cuba had picked up some acquaintance\r\nwith the Castilian. He then dismissed them loaded with presents, and\r\nwith an invitation to their countrymen to return to their homes without\r\nfear of further annoyance. This humane policy succeeded. The fugitives,\r\nreassured, were not slow in coming back; and an amicable intercourse was\r\nestablished, in which Spanish cutlery and trinkets were exchanged for\r\nthe gold ornaments of the natives; a traffic in which each party\r\ncongratulated itself--a philosopher might think with equal reason--on\r\noutwitting the other.\r\n\r\nThe first object of Cortés was to gather tidings of the unfortunate\r\nChristians who were reported to be still lingering in captivity on the\r\nneighboring continent. From some traders in the island he obtained such\r\na confirmation of the report that he sent Diego de Ordaz with two\r\nbrigantines to the opposite coast of Yucatan, with instructions to\r\nremain there eight days. Some Indians went as messengers in the vessels,\r\nwho consented to bear a letter to the captives informing them of the\r\narrival of their countrymen in Cozumel with a liberal ransom for their\r\nrelease. Meanwhile the general proposed to make an excursion to the\r\ndifferent parts of the island, that he might give employment to the\r\nrestless spirits of the soldiers, and ascertain the resources of the\r\ncountry.\r\n\r\nIt was poor and thinly peopled. But everywhere he recognized the\r\nvestiges of a higher civilization than what he had before witnessed in\r\nthe Indian islands. The houses were some of them large, and often built\r\nof stone and lime. He was particularly struck with the temples, in which\r\nwere towers constructed of the same solid materials, and rising several\r\nstories in height. In the court of one of these he was amazed by the\r\nsight of a cross, of stone and lime, about ten palms high. It was the\r\nemblem of the god of rain. Its appearance suggested the wildest\r\nconjectures, not merely to the unlettered soldiers, but subsequently to\r\nthe European scholar, who speculated on the character of the races that\r\nhad introduced there the sacred symbol of Christianity. But no such\r\ninference, as we shall see hereafter, could be warranted.[534] Yet it\r\nmust be regarded as a curious fact that the Cross should have been\r\nvenerated as the object of religious worship both in the New World and\r\nin regions of the Old where the light of Christianity had never\r\nrisen.[535]\r\n\r\nThe next object of Cortés was to reclaim the natives from their gross\r\nidolatry and to substitute a purer form of worship. In accomplishing\r\nthis he was prepared to use force, if milder measures should be\r\nineffectual. There was nothing which the Spanish government had more\r\nearnestly at heart than the conversion of the Indians. It forms the\r\nconstant burden of their instructions, and gave to the military\r\nexpeditions in this Western hemisphere somewhat of the air of a crusade.\r\nThe cavalier who embarked in them entered fully into these chivalrous\r\nand devotional feelings. No doubt was entertained of the efficacy of\r\nconversion, however sudden might be the change or however violent the\r\nmeans. The sword was a good argument, when the tongue failed; and the\r\nspread of Mahometanism had shown that seeds sown by the hand of\r\nviolence, far from perishing in the ground, would spring up and bear\r\nfruit to aftertime. If this were so in a bad cause, how much more would\r\nit be true in a good one! The Spanish cavalier felt he had a high\r\nmission to accomplish as a soldier of the Cross. However unauthorized or\r\nunrighteous the war into which he had entered may seem to us, to him it\r\nwas a holy war. He was in arms against the infidel. Not to care for the\r\nsoul of his benighted enemy was to put his own in jeopardy. The\r\nconversion of a single soul might cover a multitude of sins. It was not\r\nfor morals that he was concerned, but for _the faith_. This, though\r\nunderstood in its most literal and limited sense, comprehended the whole\r\nscheme of Christian morality. Whoever died in the faith, however immoral\r\nhad been his life, might be said to die in the Lord. Such was the creed\r\nof the Castilian knight of that day, as imbibed from the preachings of\r\nthe pulpit, from cloisters and colleges at home, from monks and\r\nmissionaries abroad,--from all save one, whose devotion, kindled at a\r\npurer source, was not, alas! permitted to send forth its radiance far\r\ninto the thick gloom by which he was encompassed.[536]\r\n\r\nNo one partook more fully of the feelings above described than Hernan\r\nCortés. He was, in truth, the very mirror of the time in which he lived,\r\nreflecting its motley characteristics, its speculative devotion and\r\npractical license, but with an intensity all his own. He was greatly\r\nscandalized at the exhibition of the idolatrous practices of the people\r\nof Cozumel, though untainted, as it would seem, with human sacrifices.\r\nHe endeavored to persuade them to embrace a better faith, through the\r\nagency of two ecclesiastics who attended the expedition,--the licentiate\r\nJuan Diaz and Father Bartolomé de Olmedo. The latter of these godly men\r\nafforded the rare example--rare in any age--of the union of fervent zeal\r\nwith charity, while he beautifully illustrated in his own conduct the\r\nprecepts which he taught. He remained with the army through the whole\r\nexpedition, and by his wise and benevolent counsels was often enabled to\r\nmitigate the cruelties of the Conquerors, and to turn aside the edge of\r\nthe sword from the unfortunate natives.\r\n\r\nThese two missionaries vainly labored to persuade the people of Cozumel\r\nto renounce their abominations, and to allow the Indian idols, in which\r\nthe Christians recognized the true lineaments of Satan,[537] to be\r\nthrown down and demolished. The simple natives, filled with horror at\r\nthe proposed profanation, exclaimed that these were the gods who sent\r\nthem the sunshine and the storm, and, should any violence be offered,\r\nthey would be sure to avenge it by sending their lightnings on the heads\r\nof its perpetrators.\r\n\r\nCortés was probably not much of a polemic. At all events, he preferred\r\non the present occasion action to argument, and thought that the best\r\nway to convince the Indians of their error was to prove the falsehood of\r\nthe prediction. He accordingly, without further ceremony, caused the\r\nvenerated images to be rolled down the stairs of the great temple,\r\namidst the groans and lamentations of the natives. An altar was hastily\r\nconstructed, an image of the Virgin and Child placed over it, and mass\r\nwas performed by Father Olmedo and his reverend companion for the first\r\ntime within the walls of a temple in New Spain. The patient ministers\r\ntried once more to pour the light of the gospel into the benighted\r\nunderstandings of the islanders, and to expound the mysteries of the\r\nCatholic faith. The Indian interpreter must have afforded rather a\r\ndubious channel for the transmission of such abstruse doctrines. But\r\nthey at length found favor with their auditors, who, whether overawed by\r\nthe bold bearing of the invaders, or convinced of the impotence of\r\ndeities that could not shield their own shrines from violation, now\r\nconsented to embrace Christianity.[538]\r\n\r\nWhile Cortés was thus occupied with the triumphs of the Cross, he\r\nreceived intelligence that Ordaz had returned from Yucatan without\r\ntidings of the Spanish captives. Though much chagrined, the general did\r\nnot choose to postpone longer his departure from Cozumel. The fleet had\r\nbeen well stored with provisions by the friendly inhabitants, and,\r\nembarking his troops, Cortés, in the beginning of March, took leave of\r\nits hospitable shores. The squadron had not proceeded far, however,\r\nbefore a leak in one of the vessels compelled them to return to the same\r\nport. The detention was attended with important consequences; so much\r\nso, indeed, that a writer of the time discerns in it “a great mystery\r\nand a miracle.”[539]\r\n\r\nSoon after landing, a canoe with several Indians was seen making its way\r\nfrom the neighboring shores of Yucatan. On reaching the island, one of\r\nthe men inquired, in broken Castilian, “if he were among Christians,”\r\nand, being answered in the affirmative, threw himself on his knees and\r\nreturned thanks to Heaven for his delivery. He was one of the\r\nunfortunate captives for whose fate so much interest had been felt. His\r\nname was Gerónimo de Aguilar,[540] a native of Écija, in Old Spain,\r\nwhere he had been regularly educated for the Church. He had been\r\nestablished with the colony at Darien, and on a voyage from that place\r\nto Hispaniola, eight years previous, was wrecked near the coast of\r\nYucatan. He escaped with several of his companions in the ship’s boat,\r\nwhere some perished from hunger and exposure, while others were\r\nsacrificed, on their reaching land, by the cannibal natives of the\r\npeninsula. Aguilar was preserved from the same dismal fate by escaping\r\ninto the interior, where he fell into the hands of a powerful cacique,\r\nwho, though he spared his life, treated him at first with great rigor.\r\nThe patience of the captive, however, and his singular humility, touched\r\nthe better feelings of the chieftain, who would have persuaded Aguilar\r\nto take a wife among his people, but the ecclesiastic steadily refused,\r\nin obedience to his vows. This admirable constancy excited the distrust\r\nof the cacique, who put his virtue to a severe test by various\r\ntemptations, and much of the same sort as those with which the devil is\r\nsaid to have assailed St. Anthony.[541] From all these fiery trials,\r\nhowever, like his ghostly predecessor, he came out unscorched.\r\nContinence is too rare and difficult a virtue with barbarians, not to\r\nchallenge their veneration, and the practice of it has made the\r\nreputation of more than one saint in the Old as well as the New World.\r\nAguilar was now intrusted with the care of his master’s household and\r\nhis numerous wives. He was a man of discretion, as well as virtue; and\r\nhis counsels were found so salutary that he was consulted on all\r\nimportant matters. In short, Aguilar became a great man among the\r\nIndians.\r\n\r\nIt was with much regret, therefore, that his master received the\r\nproposals for his return to his countrymen, to which nothing but the\r\nrich treasure of glass beads, hawk-bells, and other jewels of like\r\nvalue, sent for his ransom, would have induced him to consent. When\r\nAguilar reached the coast, there had been so much delay that the\r\nbrigantines had sailed; and it was owing to the fortunate return of the\r\nfleet to Cozumel that he was enabled to join it.\r\n\r\nOn appearing before Cortés, the poor man saluted him in the Indian\r\nstyle, by touching the earth with his hand and carrying it to his head.\r\nThe commander, raising him up, affectionately embraced him, covering him\r\nat the same time with his own cloak, as Aguilar was simply clad in the\r\nhabiliments of the country, somewhat too scanty for a European eye. It\r\nwas long, indeed, before the tastes which he had acquired in the\r\nfreedom of the forest could be reconciled to the constraints either of\r\ndress or manners imposed by the artificial forms of civilization.\r\nAguilar’s long residence in the country had familiarized him with the\r\nMayan dialects of Yucatan, and, as he gradually revived his Castilian,\r\nhe became of essential importance as an interpreter. Cortés saw the\r\nadvantage of this from the first, but he could not fully estimate all\r\nthe consequences that were to flow from it.[542]\r\n\r\nThe repairs of the vessels being at length completed, the Spanish\r\ncommander once more took leave of the friendly natives of Cozumel, and\r\nset sail on the fourth of March. Keeping as near as possible to the\r\ncoast of Yucatan, he doubled Cape Catoche, and with flowing sheets swept\r\ndown the broad bay of Campeachy, fringed with the rich dye-woods which\r\nhave since furnished so important an article of commerce to Europe. He\r\npassed Potonchan, where Cordova had experienced a rough reception from\r\nthe natives; and soon after reached the mouth of the _Rio de Tabasco_,\r\nor _Grijalva_, in which that navigator had carried on so lucrative a\r\ntraffic. Though mindful of the great object of his voyage,--the visit to\r\nthe Aztec territories,--he was desirous of acquainting himself with the\r\nresources of this country, and determined to ascend the river and visit\r\nthe great town on its borders.\r\n\r\nThe water was so shallow, from the accumulation of sand at the mouth of\r\nthe stream, that the general was obliged to leave the ships at anchor\r\nand to embark in the boats with a part only of his forces. The banks\r\nwere thickly studded with mangrove-trees, that, with their roots\r\nshooting up and interlacing one another, formed a kind of impervious\r\nscreen or net-work, behind which the dark forms of the natives were seen\r\nglancing to and fro with the most menacing looks and gestures. Cortés,\r\nmuch surprised at these unfriendly demonstrations, so unlike what he had\r\nhad reason to expect, moved cautiously up the stream. When he had\r\nreached an open place, where a large number of Indians were assembled,\r\nhe asked, through his interpreter, leave to land, explaining at the same\r\ntime his amicable intentions. But the Indians, brandishing their\r\nweapons, answered only with gestures of angry defiance. Though much\r\nchagrined, Cortés thought it best not to urge the matter further that\r\nevening, but withdrew to a neighboring island, where he disembarked his\r\ntroops, resolved to effect a landing on the following morning.\r\n\r\nWhen day broke, the Spaniards saw the opposite banks lined with a much\r\nmore numerous array than on the preceding evening, while the canoes\r\nalong the shore were filled with bands of armed warriors. Cortés now\r\nmade his preparations for the attack. He first landed a detachment of a\r\nhundred men under Alonso de Avila, at a point somewhat lower down the\r\nstream, sheltered by a thick grove of palms, from which a road, as he\r\nknew, led to the town of Tabasco, giving orders to his officer to march\r\nat once on the place, while he himself advanced to assault it in\r\nfront.[543]\r\n\r\nThen, embarking the remainder of his troops, Cortés crossed the river in\r\nface of the enemy; but, before commencing hostilities, that he might\r\n“act with entire regard to justice, and in obedience to the instructions\r\nof the Royal Council,”[544] he first caused proclamation to be made,\r\nthrough the interpreter, that he desired only a free passage for his\r\nmen, and that he proposed to revive the friendly relations which had\r\nformerly subsisted between his countrymen and the natives. He assured\r\nthem that if blood were spilt the sin would lie on their heads, and that\r\nresistance would be useless, since he was resolved at all hazards to\r\ntake up his quarters that night in the town of Tabasco. This\r\nproclamation, delivered in lofty tone, and duly recorded by the notary,\r\nwas answered by the Indians--who might possibly have comprehended one\r\nword in ten of it--with shouts of defiance and a shower of arrows.[545]\r\n\r\nCortés, having now complied with all the requisitions of a loyal\r\ncavalier, and shifted the responsibility from his own shoulders to those\r\nof the Royal Council, brought his boats alongside of the Indian canoes.\r\nThey grappled fiercely together, and both parties were soon in the\r\nwater, which rose above the girdle. The struggle was not long, though\r\ndesperate. The superior strength of the Europeans prevailed, and they\r\nforced the enemy back to land. Here, however, they were supported by\r\ntheir countrymen, who showered down darts, arrows, and blazing billets\r\nof wood on the heads of the invaders. The banks were soft and slippery,\r\nand it was with difficulty the soldiers made good their footing. Cortés\r\nlost a sandal in the mud, but continued to fight barefoot, with great\r\nexposure of his person, as the Indians, who soon singled out the leader,\r\ncalled to one another, “Strike at the chief!”\r\n\r\nAt length the Spaniards gained the bank, and were able to come into\r\nsomething like order, when they opened a brisk fire from their\r\narquebuses and cross-bows. The enemy, astounded by the roar and flash of\r\nthe fire-arms, of which they had had no experience, fell back, and\r\nretreated behind a breast-work of timber thrown across the way. The\r\nSpaniards, hot in the pursuit, soon carried these rude defences, and\r\ndrove the Tabascans before them towards the town, where they again took\r\nshelter behind their palisades.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile Avila had arrived from the opposite quarter, and the natives,\r\ntaken by surprise, made no further attempt at resistance, but abandoned\r\nthe place to the Christians. They had previously removed their families\r\nand effects. Some provisions fell into the hands of the victors, but\r\nlittle gold, “a circumstance,” says Las Casas, “which gave them no\r\nparticular satisfaction.”[546] It was a very populous place. The houses\r\nwere mostly of mud; the better sort of stone and lime; affording proofs\r\nin the inhabitants of a superior refinement to that found in the\r\nIslands, as their stout resistance had given evidence of superior\r\nvalor.[547]\r\n\r\nCortés, having thus made himself master of the town, took formal\r\npossession of it for the crown of Castile. He gave three cuts with his\r\nsword on a large _ceiba_-tree which grew in the place, and proclaimed\r\naloud that he took possession of the city in the name and behalf of the\r\nCatholic sovereigns, and would maintain and defend the same with sword\r\nand buckler against all who should gainsay it. The same vaunting\r\ndeclaration was also made by the soldiers, and the whole was duly\r\nrecorded and attested by the notary. This was the usual simple but\r\nchivalric form with which the Spanish cavaliers asserted the royal title\r\nto the conquered territories in the New World. It was a good title,\r\ndoubtless, against the claims of any other European potentate.\r\n\r\nThe general took up his quarters that night in the court-yard of the\r\nprincipal temple. He posted his sentinels, and took all the precautions\r\npractised in wars with a civilized foe. Indeed, there was reason for\r\nthem. A suspicious silence seemed to reign through the place and its\r\nneighborhood; and tidings were brought that the interpreter, Melchorejo,\r\nhad fled, leaving his Spanish dress hanging on a tree. Cortés was\r\ndisquieted by the desertion of this man, who would not only inform his\r\ncountrymen of the small number of the Spaniards, but dissipate any\r\nillusions that might be entertained of their superior natures.\r\n\r\nOn the following morning, as no traces of the enemy were visible, Cortés\r\nordered out a detachment under Alvarado, and another under Francisco de\r\nLujo, to reconnoitre. The latter officer had not advanced a league,\r\nbefore he learned the position of the Indians, by their attacking him in\r\nsuch force that he was fain to take shelter in a large stone building,\r\nwhere he was closely besieged. Fortunately, the loud yells of the\r\nassailants, like most barbarous nations seeking to strike terror by\r\ntheir ferocious cries, reached the ears of Alvarado and his men, who,\r\nspeedily advancing to the relief of their comrades, enabled them to\r\nforce a passage through the enemy. Both parties retreated, closely\r\npursued, on the town, when Cortés, marching out to their support,\r\ncompelled the Tabascans to retire.\r\n\r\nA few prisoners were taken in this skirmish. By them Cortés found his\r\nworst apprehensions verified. The country was everywhere in arms. A\r\nforce consisting of many thousands had assembled from the neighboring\r\nprovinces, and a general assault was resolved on for the next day. To\r\nthe general’s inquiries why he had been received in so different a\r\nmanner from his predecessor, Grijalva, they answered that “the conduct\r\nof the Tabascans then had given great offence to the other Indian\r\ntribes, who taxed them with treachery and cowardice; so that they had\r\npromised, on any return of the white men, to resist them in the same\r\nmanner as their neighbors had done.”[548]\r\n\r\nCortés might now well regret that he had allowed himself to deviate from\r\nthe direct object of his enterprise, and to become entangled in a\r\ndoubtful war which could lead to no profitable result. But it was too\r\nlate to repent. He had taken the step, and had no alternative but to go\r\nforward. To retreat would dishearten his own men at the outset, impair\r\ntheir confidence in him as their leader, and confirm the arrogance of\r\nhis foes, the tidings of whose success might precede him on his voyage\r\nand prepare the way for greater mortifications and defeats. He did not\r\nhesitate as to the course he was to pursue, but, calling his officers\r\ntogether, announced his intention to give battle the following\r\nmorning.[549]\r\n\r\nHe sent back to the vessels such as were disabled by their wounds, and\r\nordered the remainder of the forces to join the camp. Six of the heavy\r\nguns were also taken from the ships, together with all the horses. The\r\nanimals were stiff and torpid from long confinement on board; but a few\r\nhours’ exercise restored them to their strength and usual spirit. He\r\ngave the command of the artillery--if it may be dignified with the\r\nname--to a soldier named Mesa, who had acquired some experience as an\r\nengineer in the Italian wars. The infantry he put under the orders of\r\nDiego de Ordaz, and took charge of the cavalry himself. It consisted of\r\nsome of the most valiant gentlemen of his little band, among whom may be\r\nmentioned Alvarado, Velasquez de Leon, Avila, Puertocarrero, Olid,\r\nMontejo. Having thus made all the necessary arrangements, and settled\r\nhis plan of battle, he retired to rest,--but not to slumber. His\r\nfeverish mind, as may well be imagined, was filled with anxiety for the\r\nmorrow, which might decide the fate of his expedition; and, as was his\r\nwont on such occasions, he was frequently observed, during the night,\r\ngoing the rounds, and visiting the sentinels, to see that no one slept\r\nupon his post.\r\n\r\nAt the first glimmering of light he mustered his army, and declared his\r\npurpose not to abide, cooped up in the town, the assault of the enemy,\r\nbut to march at once against him. For he well knew that the spirits rise\r\nwith action, and that the attacking party gathers a confidence from the\r\nvery movement, which is not felt by the one who is passively, perhaps\r\nanxiously, awaiting the assault. The Indians were understood to be\r\nencamped on a level ground a few miles distant from the city, called the\r\nplain of Ceutla. The general commanded that Ordaz should march with the\r\nfoot, including the artillery, directly across the country, and attack\r\nthem in front, while he himself would fetch a circuit with the horse,\r\nand turn their flank when thus engaged, or fall upon their rear.\r\n\r\nThese dispositions being completed, the little army heard mass and then\r\nsallied forth from the wooden walls of Tabasco. It was Lady-day, the\r\ntwenty-fifth of March,--long memorable in the annals of New Spain. The\r\ndistrict around the town was checkered with patches of maize, and, on\r\nthe lower level, with plantations of cacao,--supplying the beverage, and\r\nperhaps the coin, of the country, as in Mexico. These plantations,\r\nrequiring constant irrigation, were fed by numerous canals and\r\nreservoirs of water, so that the country could not be traversed without\r\ngreat toil and difficulty. It was, however, intersected by a narrow path\r\nor causeway over which the cannon could be dragged.\r\n\r\nThe troops advanced more than a league on their laborious march, without\r\ndescrying the enemy. The weather was sultry, but few of them were\r\nembarrassed by the heavy mail worn by the European cavaliers at that\r\nperiod. Their cotton jackets, thickly quilted, afforded a tolerable\r\nprotection against the arrows of the Indians, and allowed room for the\r\nfreedom and activity of movement essential to a life of rambling\r\nadventure in the wilderness.\r\n\r\nAt length they came in sight of the broad plains of Ceutla, and beheld\r\nthe dusky lines of the enemy stretching, as far as the eye could reach,\r\nalong the edge of the horizon. The Indians had shown some sagacity in\r\nthe choice of their position; and, as the weary Spaniards came slowly\r\non, floundering through the morass, the Tabascans set up their hideous\r\nbattle-cries, and discharged volleys of arrows, stones, and other\r\nmissiles, which rattled like hail on the shields and helmets of the\r\nassailants. Many were severely wounded before they could gain the firm\r\nground, where they soon cleared a space for themselves, and opened a\r\nheavy fire of artillery and musketry on the dense columns of the enemy,\r\nwhich presented a fatal mark for the balls. Numbers were swept down at\r\nevery discharge; but the bold barbarians, far from being dismayed, threw\r\nup dust and leaves to hide their losses, and, sounding their\r\nwar-instruments, shot off fresh flights of arrows in return.\r\n\r\nThey even pressed closer on the Spaniards, and, when driven off by a\r\nvigorous charge, soon turned again, and, rolling back like the waves of\r\nthe ocean, seemed ready to overwhelm the little band by weight of\r\nnumbers. Thus cramped, the latter had scarcely room to perform their\r\nnecessary evolutions, or even to work their guns with effect.[550]\r\n\r\nThe engagement had now lasted more than an hour, and the Spaniards,\r\nsorely pressed, looked with great anxiety for the arrival of the\r\nhorse--which some unaccountable impediments must have detained--to\r\nrelieve them from their perilous position. At this crisis, the farthest\r\ncolumns of the Indian army were seen to be agitated and thrown into a\r\ndisorder that rapidly spread through the whole mass. It was not long\r\nbefore the ears of the Christians were saluted with the cheering warcry\r\nof “San Jago and San Pedro!” and they beheld the bright helmets and\r\nswords of the Castilian chivalry flashing back the rays of the morning\r\nsun, as they dashed through the ranks of the enemy, striking to the\r\nright and left, and scattering dismay around them. The eye of faith,\r\nindeed, could discern the patron Saint of Spain, himself, mounted on his\r\ngray war-horse, heading the rescue and trampling over the bodies of the\r\nfallen infidels![551]\r\n\r\nThe approach of Cortés had been greatly retarded by the broken nature of\r\nthe ground. When he came up, the Indians were so hotly engaged that he\r\nwas upon them before they observed his approach. He ordered his men to\r\ndirect their lances at the faces of their opponents,[552] who,\r\nterrified at the monstrous apparition,--for they supposed the rider and\r\nthe horse, which they had never before seen, to be one and the\r\nsame,[553]--were seized with a panic. Ordaz availed himself of it to\r\ncommand a general charge along the line, and the Indians, many of them\r\nthrowing away their arms, fled without attempting further resistance.\r\n\r\nCortés was too content with the victory to care to follow it up by\r\ndipping his sword in the blood of the fugitives. He drew off his men to\r\na copse of palms which skirted the place, and under their broad canopy\r\nthe soldiers offered up thanksgivings to the Almighty for the victory\r\nvouchsafed them. The field of battle was made the site of a town,\r\ncalled, in honor of the day on which the action took place, _Santa María\r\nde la Victoria_, long afterwards the capital of the province.[554] The\r\nnumber of those who fought or fell in the engagement is altogether\r\ndoubtful. Nothing, indeed, is more uncertain than numerical estimates of\r\nbarbarians. And they gain nothing in probability when they come, as in\r\nthe present instance, from the reports of their enemies. Most accounts,\r\nhowever, agree that the Indian force consisted of five squadrons of\r\neight thousand men each. There is more discrepancy as to the number of\r\nslain, varying from one to thirty thousand! In this monstrous\r\ndiscordance the common disposition to exaggerate may lead us to look for\r\ntruth in the neighborhood of the smallest number. The loss of the\r\nChristians was inconsiderable; not exceeding--if we receive their own\r\nreports, probably, from the same causes, much diminishing the truth--two\r\nkilled and less than a hundred wounded! We may readily comprehend the\r\nfeelings of the Conquerors, when they declared that “Heaven must have\r\nfought on their side, since their own strength could never have\r\nprevailed against such a multitude of enemies!”[555]\r\n\r\nSeveral prisoners were taken in the battle, among them two chiefs.\r\nCortés gave them their liberty, and sent a message by them to their\r\ncountrymen “that he would overlook the past, if they would come in at\r\nonce and tender their submission. Otherwise he would ride over the land,\r\nand put every living thing in it, man, woman, and child, to the sword!”\r\nWith this formidable menace ringing in their ears, the envoys departed.\r\n\r\nBut the Tabascans had no relish for further hostilities. A body of\r\ninferior chiefs appeared the next day, clad in dark dresses of cotton,\r\nintimating their abject condition, and implored leave to bury their\r\ndead. It was granted by the general, with many assurances of his\r\nfriendly disposition; but at the same time he told them he expected\r\ntheir principal caciques, as he would treat with none other. These soon\r\npresented themselves, attended by a numerous train of vassals, who\r\nfollowed with timid curiosity to the Christian camp. Among their\r\npropitiatory gifts were twenty female slaves, which, from the character\r\nof one of them, proved of infinitely more consequence than was\r\nanticipated by either Spaniards or Tabascans. Confidence was soon\r\nrestored, and was succeeded by a friendly intercourse, and the\r\ninterchange of Spanish toys for the rude commodities of the country,\r\narticles of food, cotton, and a few gold ornaments of little value. When\r\nasked where the precious metal was procured, they pointed to the west,\r\nand answered, “Culhua,” “Mexico.” The Spaniards saw this was no place\r\nfor them to traffic, or to tarry in. Yet here, they were not many\r\nleagues distant from a potent and opulent city, or what once had been\r\nso, the ancient Palenque. But its glory may have even then passed away,\r\nand its name have been forgotten by the surrounding nations.\r\n\r\nBefore his departure the Spanish commander did not omit to provide for\r\none great object of his expedition, the conversion of the Indians. He\r\nfirst represented to the caciques that he had been sent thither by a\r\npowerful monarch on the other side of the water, for whom he had now a\r\nright to claim their allegiance. He then caused the reverend fathers\r\nOlmedo and Diaz to enlighten their minds, as far as possible, in regard\r\nto the great truths of revelation, urging them to receive these in\r\nplace of their own heathenish abominations. The Tabascans, whose\r\nperceptions were no doubt materially quickened by the discipline they\r\nhad undergone, made but a faint resistance to either proposal. The next\r\nday was Palm Sunday, and the general resolved to celebrate their\r\nconversion by one of those pompous ceremonials of the Church, which\r\nshould make a lasting impression on their minds.\r\n\r\nA solemn procession was formed of the whole army, with the ecclesiastics\r\nat their head, each soldier bearing a palm-branch in his hand. The\r\nconcourse was swelled by thousands of Indians of both sexes, who\r\nfollowed in curious astonishment at the spectacle. The long files bent\r\ntheir way through the flowery savannas that bordered the settlement, to\r\nthe principal temple, where an altar was raised, and the image of the\r\npresiding deity was deposed to make room for that of the Virgin with the\r\ninfant Saviour. Mass was celebrated by Father Olmedo, and the soldiers\r\nwho were capable joined in the solemn chant. The natives listened in\r\nprofound silence, and, if we may believe the chronicler of the event who\r\nwitnessed it, were melted into tears; while their hearts were penetrated\r\nwith reverential awe for the God of those terrible beings who seemed to\r\nwield in their own hands the thunder and the lightning.[556]\r\n\r\nThe Roman Catholic communion has, it must be admitted, some decided\r\nadvantages over the Protestant, for the purposes of proselytism. The\r\ndazzling pomp of its service and its touching appeal to the\r\nsensibilities affect the imagination of the rude child of nature much\r\nmore powerfully than the cold abstractions of Protestantism, which,\r\naddressed to the reason, demand a degree of refinement and mental\r\nculture in the audience to comprehend them. The respect, moreover, shown\r\nby the Catholic for the material representations of Divinity, greatly\r\nfacilitates the same object. It is true, such representations are used\r\nby him only as incentives, not as the objects of worship. But this\r\ndistinction is lost on the savage, who finds such forms of adoration too\r\nanalogous to his own to impose any great violence on his feelings. It is\r\nonly required of him to transfer his homage from the image of\r\nQuetzalcoatl, the benevolent deity who walked among men, to that of the\r\nVirgin or the Redeemer; from the Cross, which he has worshipped as the\r\nemblem of the god of rain, to the same Cross, the symbol of salvation.\r\n\r\nThese solemnities concluded, Cortés prepared to return to his ships,\r\nwell satisfied with the impression made on the new converts, and with\r\nthe conquests he had thus achieved for Castile and Christianity. The\r\nsoldiers, taking leave of their Indian friends, entered the boats with\r\nthe palm-branches in their hands, and, descending the river, re-embarked\r\non board their vessels, which rode at anchor at its mouth. A favorable\r\nbreeze was blowing, and the little navy, opening its sails to receive\r\nit, was soon on its way again to the golden shores of Mexico.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER V\r\n\r\n     VOYAGE ALONG THE COAST--DOÑA MARINA--SPANIARDS LAND IN\r\n     MEXICO--INTERVIEW WITH THE AZTECS\r\n\r\n1519\r\n\r\n\r\nThe fleet held its course so near the shore that the inhabitants could\r\nbe seen on it; and, as it swept along the winding borders of the Gulf,\r\nthe soldiers, who had been on the former expedition with Grijalva,\r\npointed out to their companions the memorable places on the coast. Here\r\nwas the _Rio de Alvarado_, named after the gallant adventurer, who was\r\npresent also in this expedition; there the _Rio de Vanderas_, in which\r\nGrijalva had carried on so lucrative a commerce with the Mexicans; and\r\nthere the _Isla de los Sacrificios_, where the Spaniards first saw the\r\nvestiges of human sacrifice on the coast. Puertocarrero, as he listened\r\nto these reminiscences of the sailors, repeated the words of the old\r\nballad of Montesinos, “Here is France, there is Paris, and there the\r\nwaters of the Duero,”[557] etc. “But I advise you,” he added, turning\r\nto Cortés, “to look out only for the rich lands, and the best way to\r\ngovern them.” “Fear not,” replied his commander: “if Fortune but favors\r\nme as she did Orlando, and I have such gallant gentlemen as you for my\r\ncompanions, I shall understand myself very well.”[558]\r\n\r\nThe fleet had now arrived off San Juan de Ulua, the island so named by\r\nGrijalva. The weather was temperate and serene, and crowds of natives\r\nwere gathered on the shore of the main land, gazing at the strange\r\nphenomenon, as the vessels glided along under easy sail on the smooth\r\nbosom of the waters. It was the evening of Thursday in Passion Week. The\r\nair came pleasantly off the shore, and Cortés, liking the spot, thought\r\nhe might safely anchor under the lee of the island, which would shelter\r\nhim from the _nortes_ that sweep over these seas with fatal violence in\r\nthe winter, sometimes even late in the spring.\r\n\r\nThe ships had not been long at anchor, when a light pirogue, filled with\r\nnatives, shot off from the neighboring continent, and steered for the\r\ngeneral’s vessel, distinguished by the royal ensign of Castile floating\r\nfrom the mast. The Indians came on board with a frank confidence,\r\ninspired by the accounts of the Spaniards spread by their countrymen who\r\nhad traded with Grijalva. They brought presents of fruits and flowers\r\nand little ornaments of gold, which they gladly exchanged for the usual\r\ntrinkets. Cortés was baffled in his attempts to hold a conversation with\r\nhis visitors by means of the interpreter, Aguilar, who was ignorant of\r\nthe language; the Mayan dialects, with which he was conversant, bearing\r\ntoo little resemblance to the Aztec. The natives supplied the\r\ndeficiency, as far as possible, by the uncommon vivacity and\r\nsignificance of their gestures,--the hieroglyphics of speech; but the\r\nSpanish commander saw with chagrin the embarrassments he must encounter\r\nin future for want of a more perfect medium of communication.[559] In\r\nthis dilemma, he was informed that one of the female slaves given to him\r\nby the Tabascan chiefs was a native Mexican, and understood the\r\nlanguage. Her name--that given to her by the Spaniards--was Marina; and,\r\nas she was to exercise a most important influence on their fortunes, it\r\nis necessary to acquaint the reader with something of her character and\r\nhistory.\r\n\r\nShe was born at Painalla, in the province of Coatzacualco, on the\r\nsoutheastern borders of the Mexican empire. Her father, a rich and\r\npowerful cacique, died when she was very young. Her mother married\r\nagain, and, having a son, she conceived the infamous idea of securing to\r\nthis offspring of her second union Marina’s rightful inheritance. She\r\naccordingly feigned that the latter was dead, but secretly delivered her\r\ninto the hands of some itinerant traders of Xicallanco. She availed\r\nherself, at the same time, of the death of a child of one of her slaves,\r\nto substitute the corpse for that of her own daughter, and celebrated\r\nthe obsequies with mock solemnity. These particulars are related by the\r\nhonest old soldier Bernal Diaz, who knew the mother, and witnessed the\r\ngenerous treatment of her afterwards by Marina. By the merchants the\r\nIndian maiden was again sold to the cacique of Tabasco, who delivered\r\nher, as we have seen, to the Spaniards.\r\n\r\nFrom the place of her birth, she was well acquainted with the Mexican\r\ntongue, which, indeed, she is said to have spoken with great elegance.\r\nHer residence in Tabasco familiarized her with the dialects of that\r\ncountry, so that she could carry on a conversation with Aguilar, which\r\nhe in turn rendered into the Castilian. Thus a certain though somewhat\r\ncircuitous channel was opened to Cortés for communicating with the\r\nAztecs; a circumstance of the last importance to the success of his\r\nenterprise. It was not very long, however, before Marina, who had a\r\nlively genius, made herself so far mistress of the Castilian as to\r\nsupersede the necessity of any other linguist. She learned it the more\r\nreadily, as it was to her the language of love.\r\n\r\nCortés, who appreciated the value of her services from the first, made\r\nher his interpreter, then his secretary, and, won by her charms, his\r\nmistress. She had a son by him, Don Martin Cortés, _comendador_ of the\r\nMilitary Order of St. James, less distinguished by his birth than his\r\nunmerited persecutions.\r\n\r\nMarina was at this time in the morning of life. She is said to have\r\npossessed uncommon personal attractions,[560] and her open, expressive\r\nfeatures indicated her generous temper. She always remained faithful to\r\nthe countrymen of her adoption; and her knowledge of the language and\r\ncustoms of the Mexicans, and often of their designs, enabled her to\r\nextricate the Spaniards, more than once, from the most embarrassing and\r\nperilous situations. She had her errors, as we have seen. But they\r\nshould be rather charged to the defects of early education, and to the\r\nevil influence of him to whom in the darkness of her spirit she looked\r\nwith simple confidence for the light to guide her. All agree that she\r\nwas full of excellent qualities, and the important services which she\r\nrendered the Spaniards have made her memory deservedly dear to them;\r\nwhile the name of Malinche[561]--the name by which she is still known in\r\nMexico--was pronounced with kindness by the conquered races, with whose\r\nmisfortunes she showed an invariable sympathy.[562]\r\n\r\nWith the aid of his two intelligent interpreters, Cortés entered into\r\nconversation with his Indian visitors. He learned that they were\r\nMexicans, or rather subjects of the great Mexican empire, of which their\r\nown province formed one of the comparatively recent conquests. The\r\ncountry was ruled by a powerful monarch, called Moctheuzoma, or by\r\nEuropeans more commonly Montezuma,[563] who dwelt on the mountain plains\r\nof the interior, nearly seventy leagues from the coast; their own\r\nprovince was governed by one of his nobles, named Teuhtlile, whose\r\nresidence was eight leagues distant. Cortés acquainted them in turn with\r\nhis own friendly views in visiting their country, and with his desire of\r\nan interview with the Aztec governor. He then dismissed them loaded with\r\npresents, having first ascertained that there was abundance of gold in\r\nthe interior, like the specimens they had brought.\r\n\r\nCortés, pleased with the manners of the people and the goodly reports of\r\nthe land, resolved to take up his quarters here for the present. The\r\nnext morning, April twenty-first, being Good Friday, he landed, with all\r\nhis force, on the very spot where now stands the modern city of Vera\r\nCruz. Little did the Conqueror imagine that the desolate beach on which\r\nhe first planted his foot was one day to be covered by a flourishing\r\ncity, the great mart of European and Oriental trade, the commercial\r\ncapital of New Spain.[564]\r\n\r\nIt was a wide and level plain, except where the sand had been drifted\r\ninto hillocks by the perpetual blowing of the _norte_. On these\r\nsand-hills he mounted his little battery of guns, so as to give him the\r\ncommand of the country. He then employed the troops in cutting down\r\nsmall trees and bushes which grew near, in order to provide a shelter\r\nfrom the weather. In this he was aided by the people of the country,\r\nsent, as it appeared, by the governor of the district to assist the\r\nSpaniards. With their help stakes were firmly set in the earth, and\r\ncovered with boughs, and with mats and cotton carpets, which the\r\nfriendly natives brought with them. In this way they secured, in a\r\ncouple of days, a good defence against the scorching rays of the sun,\r\nwhich beat with intolerable fierceness on the sands. The place was\r\nsurrounded by stagnant marshes, the exhalations from which, quickened\r\nby the heat into the pestilent malaria, have occasioned in later times\r\nwider mortality to Europeans than all the hurricanes on the coast. The\r\nbilious disorders, now the terrible scourge of the _tierra caliente_,\r\nwere little known before the Conquest. The seeds of the poison seem to\r\nhave been scattered by the hand of civilization; for it is only\r\nnecessary to settle a town, and draw together a busy European\r\npopulation, in order to call out the malignity of the venom which had\r\nbefore lurked innoxious in the atmosphere.[565]\r\n\r\nWhile these arrangements were in progress, the natives flocked in from\r\nthe adjacent district, which was tolerably populous in the interior,\r\ndrawn by a natural curiosity to see the wonderful strangers. They\r\nbrought with them fruits, vegetables, flowers in abundance, game, and\r\nmany dishes cooked after the fashion of the country, with little\r\narticles of gold and other ornaments. They gave away some as presents,\r\nand bartered others for the wares of the Spaniards; so that the camp,\r\ncrowded with a motley throng of every age and sex, wore the appearance\r\nof a fair. From some of the visitors Cortés learned the intention of the\r\ngovernor to wait on him the following day.\r\n\r\nThis was Easter. Teuhtlile arrived, as he had announced, before noon. He\r\nwas attended by a numerous train, and was met by Cortés, who conducted\r\nhim with much ceremony to his tent, where his principal officers were\r\nassembled. The Aztec chief returned their salutations with polite though\r\nformal courtesy. Mass was first said by Father Olmedo, and the service\r\nwas listened to by Teuhtlile and his attendants with decent reverence. A\r\ncollation was afterwards served, at which the general entertained his\r\nguest with Spanish wines and confections. The interpreters were then\r\nintroduced, and a conversation commenced between the parties.\r\n\r\nThe first inquiries of Teuhtlile were respecting the country of the\r\nstrangers and the purport of their visit. Cortés told him that “he was\r\nthe subject of a potent monarch beyond the seas, who ruled over an\r\nimmense empire, and had kings and princes for his vassals; that,\r\nacquainted with the greatness of the Mexican emperor, his master had\r\ndesired to enter into a communication with him, and had sent him as his\r\nenvoy to wait on Montezuma with a present in token of his good will, and\r\na message which he must deliver in person.” He concluded by inquiring of\r\nTeuhtlile when he could be admitted to his sovereign’s presence.\r\n\r\nTo this the Aztec noble somewhat haughtily replied, “How is it that you\r\nhave been here only two days, and demand to see the emperor?” He then\r\nadded, with more courtesy, that “he was surprised to learn there was\r\nanother monarch as powerful as Montezuma, but that, if it were so, he\r\nhad no doubt his master would be happy to communicate with him. He would\r\nsend his couriers with the royal gift brought by the Spanish commander,\r\nand, so soon as he had learned Montezuma’s will, would communicate it.”\r\n\r\nTeuhtlile then commanded his slaves to bring forward the present\r\nintended for the Spanish general. It consisted of ten loads of fine\r\ncottons, several mantles of that curious feather-work whose rich and\r\ndelicate dyes might vie with the most beautiful painting, and a wicker\r\nbasket filled with ornaments of wrought gold, all calculated to inspire\r\nthe Spaniards with high ideas of the wealth and mechanical ingenuity of\r\nthe Mexicans.\r\n\r\nCortés received these presents with suitable acknowledgments, and\r\nordered his own attendants to lay before the chief the articles designed\r\nfor Montezuma. These were an arm-chair richly carved and painted, a\r\ncrimson cap of cloth, having a gold medal emblazoned with St. George and\r\nthe dragon, and a quantity of collars, bracelets, and other ornaments of\r\ncut glass, which, in a country where glass was not to be had, might\r\nclaim to have the value of real gems, and no doubt passed for such with\r\nthe inexperienced Mexican. Teuhtlile observed a soldier in the camp with\r\na shining gilt helmet on his head, which he said reminded him of one\r\nworn by the god Quetzalcoatl in Mexico; and he showed a desire that\r\nMontezuma should see it. The coming of the Spaniards, as the reader\r\nwill soon see, was associated with some traditions of this same deity.\r\nCortés expressed his willingness that the casque should be sent to the\r\nemperor, intimating a hope that it would be returned filled with the\r\ngold dust of the country, that he might be able to compare its quality\r\nwith that in his own! He further told the governor, as we are informed\r\nby his chaplain, “that the Spaniards were troubled with a disease of the\r\nheart, for which gold was a specific remedy”![566] “In short,” says Las\r\nCasas, “he contrived to make his want of gold very clear to the\r\ngovernor.”[567]\r\n\r\nWhile these things were passing, Cortés observed one of Teuhtlile’s\r\nattendants busy with a pencil, apparently delineating some object. On\r\nlooking at his work, he found that it was a sketch on canvas of the\r\nSpaniards, their costumes, arms, and, in short, different objects of\r\ninterest, giving to each its appropriate form and color. This was the\r\ncelebrated picture-writing of the Aztecs, and, as Teuhtlile informed\r\nhim, this man was employed in portraying the various objects for the eye\r\nof Montezuma, who would thus gather a more vivid notion of their\r\nappearance than from any description by words. Cortés was pleased with\r\nthe idea; and, as he knew how much the effect would be heightened by\r\nconverting still life into action, he ordered out the cavalry on the\r\nbeach, the wet sands of which afforded a firm footing for the horses.\r\nThe bold and rapid movements of the troops, as they went through their\r\nmilitary exercises; the apparent ease with which they managed the fiery\r\nanimals on which they were mounted; the glancing of their weapons, and\r\nthe shrill cry of the trumpet, all filled the spectators with\r\nastonishment; but when they heard the thunders of the cannon, which\r\nCortés ordered to be fired at the same time, and witnessed the volumes\r\nof smoke and flame issuing from these terrible engines, and the rushing\r\nsound of the balls, as they dashed through the trees of the neighboring\r\nforest, shivering their branches into fragments, they were filled with\r\nconsternation, from which the Aztec chief himself was not wholly free.\r\n\r\nNothing of all this was lost on the painters, who faithfully recorded,\r\nafter their fashion, every particular; not omitting the ships,--“the\r\nwater-houses,” as they called them, of the strangers,--which, with their\r\ndark hulls and snow-white sails reflected from the water, were swinging\r\nlazily at anchor on the calm bosom of the bay. All was depicted with a\r\nfidelity that excited in their turn the admiration of the Spaniards,\r\nwho, doubtless, unprepared for this exhibition of skill, greatly\r\noverestimated the merits of the execution.[568]\r\n\r\nThese various matters completed, Teuhtlile with his attendants withdrew\r\nfrom the Spanish quarters, with the same ceremony with which he had\r\nentered them; leaving orders that his people should supply the troops\r\nwith provisions and other articles requisite for their accommodation,\r\ntill further instructions from the capital.[569]\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[1] Lewis H.

Medio tutissimus ibis. The term Empire is misleading.\r\nThe states of Querétaro, Guanajuato, Michoacán, Guerrero, and much of\r\nLa Puebla, in modern Mexico, almost surround the so-called Empire of\r\nMontezuma. Possibly the tributary pueblos may have covered an area\r\nequal to that of the State of Massachusetts.--M.]\r\n\r\n[5] I have conformed to the limits fixed by Clavigero. He has,\r\nprobably, examined the subject with more thoroughness and fidelity\r\nthan most of his countrymen, who differ from him, and who assign\r\na more liberal extent to the monarchy. (See his Storia antica del\r\nMessico (Cesena, 1780), dissert. 7.) The abbé, however, has not\r\ninformed his readers on what frail foundations his conclusions rest.\r\nThe extent of the Aztec empire is to be gathered from the writings\r\nof historians since the arrival of the Spaniards, and from the\r\npicture-rolls of tribute paid by the conquered cities; both sources\r\nextremely vague and defective. See the MSS. of the Mendoza collection,\r\nin Lord Kingsborough’s magnificent publication (Antiquities of Mexico,\r\ncomprising Facsimiles of Ancient Paintings and Hieroglyphics, together\r\nwith the Monuments of New Spain. London, 1830). The difficulty of the\r\ninquiry is much increased by the fact of the conquests having been\r\nmade, as will be seen hereafter, by the united arms of three powers,\r\nso that it is not always easy to tell to which party they eventually\r\nbelonged. The affair is involved in so much uncertainty that Clavigero,\r\nnotwithstanding the positive assertions in his text, has not ventured,\r\nin his map, to define the precise limits of the empire, either towards\r\nthe north, where it mingles with the Tezcucan empire, or towards the\r\nsouth, where, indeed, he has fallen into the egregious blunder of\r\nasserting that, while the Mexican territory reached to the fourteenth\r\ndegree, it did not include any portion of Guatemala. (See tom. i. p.\r\n29, and tom. iv. dissert. 7.) The Tezcucan chronicler Ixtlilxochitl\r\nputs in a sturdy claim for the paramount empire of his own nation.\r\nHistoria Chichimeca, MS., cap. 39, 53, et alibi.\r\n\r\n[6] Eighteen to twenty thousand, according to Humboldt, who considers\r\nthe Mexican territory to have been the same with that occupied by\r\nthe modern intendancies of Mexico, Puebla, Vera Cruz, Oaxaca, and\r\nValladolid.

Of recent\r\ntourists, no one has given a more gorgeous picture of the impressions\r\nmade on his senses by these sunny regions than Latrobe, who came on\r\nshore at Tampico (Rambler in Mexico (New York, 1836), chap. 1),--a\r\ntraveller, it may be added, whose descriptions of man and nature in our\r\nown country, where we can judge, are distinguished by a sobriety and\r\nfairness that entitle him to confidence in his delineation of other\r\ncountries.\r\n\r\n[9] This long extent of country varies in elevation from 5570 to 8856\r\nfeet,--equal to the height of the passes of Mount Cenis or the Great\r\nSt. Bernard.

The more elevated plateaus of the table-land, as the\r\nValley of Toluca, about 8500 feet above the sea, have a stern climate,\r\nin which the thermometer, during a great part of the day, rarely rises\r\nbeyond 45° F. Idem (loc. cit.), and Malte-Brun (Universal Geography,\r\nEng. trans., book 83), who is, indeed, in this part of his work, but an\r\necho of the former writer.\r\n\r\n[11] The elevation of the Castiles, according to the authority\r\nrepeatedly cited, is about 350 toises, or 2100 feet above the ocean.\r\n(Humboldt’s Dissertation, apud Laborde, Itinéraire descriptif de\r\nl’Espagne (Paris, 1827), tom. i. p. 5.) It is rare to find plains in\r\nEurope of so great a height.\r\n\r\n[12] Archbishop Lorenzana estimates the circuit of the Valley at ninety\r\nleagues, correcting at the same time the statement of Cortés, which\r\nputs it at seventy, very near the truth, as appears from the result of\r\nM. de Humboldt’s measurement, cited in the text. Its length is about\r\neighteen leagues, by twelve and a half in breadth. (Humboldt, Essai\r\npolitique, tom. ii. p. 29.--Lorenzana, Hist. de Nueva-España, p. 101.)\r\nHumboldt’s map of the Valley of Mexico forms the third in his “Atlas\r\ngéographique et physique,” and, like all the others in the collection,\r\nwill be found of inestimable value to the traveller, the geologist, and\r\nthe historian.\r\n\r\n[13] Humboldt, Essai politique, tom. ii. pp. 29, 44-49.--Malte-Brun,\r\nbook 85. This latter geographer assigns only 6700 feet for the level of\r\nthe Valley, contradicting himself (comp. book 83), or rather Humboldt,\r\nto whose pages he helps himself _plenis manibus_, somewhat too\r\nliberally, indeed, for the scanty references at the bottom of his page.\r\n\r\n[14] Torquemada accounts in part for this diminution by supposing\r\nthat, as God permitted the waters, which once covered the whole earth,\r\nto subside after mankind had been nearly exterminated for their\r\niniquities, so he allowed the waters of the Mexican lake to subside,\r\nin token of good will and reconciliation, after the idolatrous races\r\nof the land had been destroyed by the Spaniards! (Monarchía Indiana\r\n(Madrid, 1723), tom. i. p. 309.) Quite as probable, if not as orthodox,\r\nan explanation, may be found in the active evaporation of these upper\r\nregions, and in the fact of an immense drain having been constructed,\r\nduring the lifetime of the good father, to reduce the waters of the\r\nprincipal lake and protect the capital from inundation.\r\n\r\n[15] [It is perhaps to be regretted that, instead of a meagre notice\r\nof the Toltecs with a passing allusion to earlier races, the author\r\ndid not give a separate chapter to the history of the country during\r\nthe ages preceding the Conquest. That history, it is true, resting\r\non tradition or on questionable records mingled with legendary and\r\nmythological relations, is full of obscurity and doubt. But whatever\r\nits uncertainty in regard to details, it presents a mass of general\r\nfacts supported by analogy and by the stronger evidence of language\r\nand of the existing relics of the past. The number and diversity of\r\nthe architectural and other remains found on the soil of Mexico and\r\nthe adjacent regions, and the immense variety of the spoken languages,\r\nwith the vestiges of others that have passed out of use,--all perhaps\r\nderived originally from a common stock, but exhibiting different stages\r\nof development or decay, and capable of being classified into several\r\ndistinct families,--point to conclusions that render the subject\r\none of the most attractive fields for critical investigation. These\r\nconcurrent testimonies leave no doubt that, like portions of the Old\r\nWorld similarly favored in regard to climate, soil, and situation, the\r\ncentral regions of America were occupied from a very remote period\r\nby nations which made distinct advances in civilization, and passed\r\nthrough a cycle of revolutions comparable to that of which the Valley\r\nof the Euphrates and other parts of Asia were anciently the scene. The\r\nuseful arts were known and practised, wealth was accumulated, social\r\nsystems exhibiting a certain refinement and a peculiar complexity were\r\norganized, states were established which flourished, decayed,--either\r\nfrom the effects of isolation or an inherent incapacity for\r\ncontinuance,--and were finally overthrown by invaders, by whom the\r\nexperiment was repeated, though not always with equal success. Some of\r\nthese nations passed away, leaving no trace but their names; others,\r\nwhose very names are unknown, left mysterious monuments imbedded in\r\nthe soil or records that are undecipherable. Of those that still\r\nremain, comprising about a dozen distinct races speaking a hundred\r\nand twenty different dialects, we have the traditions preserved\r\neither in their own records or in those of the Spanish discoverers.\r\nThe task of constructing out of these materials a history shorn of\r\nthe adornments of mythology and fable has been attempted by the Abbé\r\nBrasseur de Bourbourg (Histoire des Nations civilisées du Mexique et de\r\nl’Amérique-Centrale, durant les Siècles antérieurs à Christophe Colomb,\r\n4 vols., Paris, 1857-59), and, whatever may be thought of the method\r\nhe has pursued, his research is unquestionable, and his views--very\r\ndifferent from those which he has since put forth--merit attention. A\r\nmore practical effort has been made by Don Manuel Orozco y Berra to\r\ntrace the order, diffusion, and relations of the various races by the\r\ndifferences, the intermixtures, and the geographical limits of their\r\nlanguages. (Geografía de las Lenguas y Carta etnográfica de México,\r\nprecedidas de un Ensayo de Clasificacion de las mismas Lenguas y de\r\nApuntes para las Inmigraciones de las Tribus, México, 1864.)--K.]\r\n\r\n[16] [The uncertainty is not diminished by our being told that Tollan,\r\nTullan, Tulan, or Tula (called also Tlapallan and Huehuetlapallan)\r\nwas the original seat of this people, since we are still left in\r\ndoubt whether the country so designated--like Aztlan, the supposed\r\npoint of departure of the Aztecs--is to be located in New Mexico,\r\nCalifornia, the northwestern extremity of America, or in Asia. M.\r\nBrasseur de Bourbourg (whose later speculations, in which the name\r\nplays a conspicuous part, will be noticed more appropriately in the\r\nAppendix) found in the Quiché manuscripts mention of four Tollans, one\r\nof them “in the east, on the other side of the sea.” “But,” he adds,\r\n“in what part of the world is it to be placed? _C’est là encore une\r\nquestion bien difficile à résoudre._” (Hist. des Nations civilisées\r\ndu Mexique, tom. i. pp. 167, 168.) Nor will the etymology much help\r\nus. According to Buschmann, _Tollan_ is derived from _tolin_, reed,\r\nand signifies “place of reeds,”--“Ort der Binsen, Platz mit Binsen\r\ngewachsen, _juncetum_.” (Über die aztekischen Ortsnamen, S. 682.) He\r\nrefers, however, to a different derivation, suggested by a writer who\r\nhas made it the basis of one of those extraordinary theories which\r\nare propounded from time to time, to account for the first diffusion\r\nof the human race, and more particularly for the original settlement\r\nof America. According to this theory, the cradle of mankind was the\r\nHimalayan Mountains. “But the collective name of these lofty regions\r\nwas very anciently designated by appellations the roots of which\r\nwere _Tal_, _Tol_, _Tul_, meaning tall, high, ... as it does yet in\r\nmany languages, the English, Chinese, and Arabic for instance. Such\r\nwere _Tolo_, _Thala_, _Talaha_, _Tulan_, etc., in the old Sanscrit\r\nand primitive languages of Asia. Whence came the Asiatic _Atlas_ and\r\nalso the _Atlantes_ of the Greeks, who, spreading through the world\r\nwesterly, gave these names to many other places and notions.... The\r\nTalas or Atlantes occupied or conquered Europe and Africa, nay, went\r\nto America in very early times.... In Greece they became _Atalantes_,\r\n_Talautians_ of Epirus, _Aetolians_.... They gave name to Italy,\r\n_Aitala_ meaning land eminent, ... to the Atlantic Ocean, and to\r\nthe great Atlantis, or America, called in the Hindu books _Atala_\r\nor _Tala-tolo_, the fourth world, where dwelt giants or powerful\r\nmen.... America is also filled with their names and deeds from Mexico\r\nand Carolina to Peru: the _Tol-tecas_, people of Tol, and Aztlan,\r\n_Otolum_ near Palenque, many towns of _Tula_ and _Tolu_; the _Talas_\r\nof Michuacan, the _Matalans_, _Atalans_, _Tulukis_, etc., of North\r\nAmerica.” (C. S. Rafinesque, Atlantic Journal, Philadelphia, 1832-33.)\r\nIt need hardly be added that Tula has also been identified with\r\nthe equally unknown and long-sought-for _ultima_ _Thule_, with the\r\nsimplifying effect of bringing two streams of inquiry into one channel.\r\nMeanwhile, by a different kind of criticism, the whole question\r\nis dissipated into thin air, _Tollan_ and _Aztlan_ being resolved\r\ninto names of mere mythical import, and the regions thus designated\r\ntransferred from the earth to the bright domain of the sky, from which\r\nthe descriptions in the legends appear to have been borrowed. See\r\nBrinton, Myths of the New World, pp. 88, 89.--K.]\r\n\r\n[17] Anahuac, according to Humboldt, comprehended only the country\r\nbetween the fourteenth and twenty-first degrees of north latiude.\r\n(Essai politique, tom. i. p. 197.) According to Clavigero, it included\r\nnearly all since known as New Spain. (Stor. del Messico, tom. i. p.\r\n27.) Veytia uses it, also, as synonymous with New Spain. (Historia\r\nantigua de Méjico (Méjico, 1836), tom. i. cap. 12.) The first of these\r\nwriters probably allows too little, as the latter do too much, for\r\nits boundaries. Ixtlilxochitl says it extended four hundred leagues\r\nsouth of the Otomi country. (Hist. Chichimeca, MS., cap. 73.) The word\r\nAnahuac signifies _near the water_. It was, probably, first applied\r\nto the country around the lakes in the Mexican Valley, and gradually\r\nextended to the remoter regions occupied by the Aztecs and the other\r\nsemi-civilized races. Or possibly the name may have been intended, as\r\nVeytia suggests (Hist. antig., lib. 1, cap. 1), to denote the land\r\nbetween the waters of the Atlantic and Pacific.{*}\r\n\r\n{*} [This suggestion of Veytia is unworthy of attention,--refuted by\r\nthe actual application and appropriateness of the name, and by the\r\nstate of geographical knowledge and ideas at the period when it must\r\nhave originated. A modern traveller, describing the appearance of the\r\ngreat plains as seen from the summit of Popocatepetl, remarks, “Even\r\nnow that the lakes have shrunk to a fraction of their former size, we\r\ncould see the fitness of the name given in old times to the Valley of\r\nMexico, _Anahuac_, that is, By the water-side.” Tylor, Anahuac; or\r\nMexico and the Mexicans, Ancient and Modern (London, 1861), p. 270.--K.]\r\n\r\n[18] Clavigero talks of Boturini’s having written “on the faith of\r\nthe Toltec historians.” (Stor. del Messico, tom. i. p. 128.) But that\r\nscholar does not pretend to have ever met with a Toltec manuscript\r\nhimself, and had heard of only one in the possession of Ixtlilxochitl.\r\n(See his Idea de una nueva Historia general de la América Septentrional\r\n(Madrid, 1746), p. 110.) The latter writer tells us that his account\r\nof the Toltec and Chichimec races was “derived from interpretation”\r\n(probably of the Tezcucan paintings), “and from the traditions of old\r\nmen;” poor authority for events which had passed centuries before.\r\nIndeed, he acknowledges that their narratives were so full of absurdity\r\nand falsehood that he was obliged to reject nine-tenths of them. (See\r\nhis Relaciones, MS., no. 5.) The cause of truth would not have suffered\r\nmuch, probably, if he had rejected nine-tenths of the remainder.{*}\r\n\r\n{*} [Ixtlilxochitl’s language does not necessarily imply that he\r\nconsidered any of the relations he had received as false or absurd,\r\nnor does he say that he had rejected nine-tenths of them.

But\r\nthese opinions have been refuted by later investigators. Orozco y\r\nBerra, in an elaborate and satisfactory examination of the question,\r\ndiscusses all the evidence relating to it, compares the remains in the\r\nsouthern provinces with those of the Valley of Mexico, points out the\r\nessential differences in the architecture, sculpture, and inscriptions,\r\nand arrives at the conclusion that there was “no point of contact or\r\nresemblance” between the two civilizations. He considers that of the\r\nsouthern provinces, though of a far higher grade, as long anterior\r\nin time to the Toltec domination,--the work of a people which had\r\npassed away, under the assaults of barbarism, at a period prior to all\r\ntraditions, leaving no name and no trace of their existence save those\r\nmonuments which, neglected and forgotten by their successors, have\r\nbecome the riddle of later generations.{*} Geografía de las Lenguas de\r\nMéxico, pp. 122-131.

Dr. Brinton holds that Father Duran, Historia de las Indias\r\nde Nueva España, Tezozomoc, Croníca Mexicana, and the Codex Ramirez\r\nidentify the Toltecs with the Aztecs. As John Fiske puts it, “it is\r\nwell to beware, however, about meddling much with these Toltecs.”\r\nMr. Fiske urges like caution concerning the Chichimecs. Bandelier\r\n(Archæological Tour, p. 192) points out that Ixtlilxochitl, the\r\nhistorian of the Chichimecs, “wrote for an interested object, and\r\nwith a view of sustaining tribal claims in the eyes of the Spanish\r\ngovernment.”--M.]\r\n\r\n[26] _Tezcuco_ signifies “place of detention;” as several of the tribes\r\nwho successively occupied Anahuac were said to have halted some time at\r\nthe spot.

If the latter received from the former the\r\nknowledge of those arts in which they speedily rivalled them, it must\r\nhave been by more direct communication and transmission than can be\r\ninferred from the mention of a small fraction of the Toltec population\r\nas remaining in the country,--a fact which has itself the appearance of\r\nhaving been invented to meet the difficulty. Orozco y Berra compares\r\nthis transitional period with that which followed the overthrow of the\r\nRoman Empire; but if in the former case there was, in his own words,\r\n“no conquest, but only an occupation, no war because no one to contend\r\nwith,” the analogy altogether fails. Brasseur de Bourbourg reduces the\r\ninterval between the departure of the Toltecs and the arrival of the\r\nChichimecs to a few years, and supposes that a considerable number\r\nof the former inhabitants remained scattered through the Valley. If,\r\nhowever, it be allowable to substitute probabilities for doubtful\r\nrelations, it is an easier solution to believe that no interval\r\noccurred and that no emigration took place.--K.]\r\n\r\n[28] The historian speaks, in one page, of the Chichimecs burrowing in\r\ncaves, or, at best, in cabins of straw, and, in the next, talks gravely\r\nof their _señoras_, _infantas_, and _caballeros_!{*} Ibid., cap. 9, et\r\nseq.--Veytia, Hist. antig., lib. 2, cap. 1-10.--Camargo, Historia de\r\nTlascala, MS.\r\n\r\n[29] Ixtlilxochitl, Hist.

The most primitive traditions, as well as the\r\nremains of the earliest civilization, belong also to the same quarter.\r\nThis latter fact, however, is considered by Orozco y Berra as itself\r\nan evidence of the migrations having been from the North, the first\r\ncomers having been naturally attracted southward by a warmer climate\r\nand more fertile soil, or pushed onward in this direction by successive\r\ninvasions from behind. Contradictory inferences have in like manner\r\nbeen drawn from the existence of Aztec remains and settlements in\r\nNew Mexico and Arizona. All that can be said with confidence is that\r\nneither of the opposing theories rests on a secure and sufficient\r\nbasis.--K.]\r\n\r\n[31] These were the Colhuans, not Acolhuans, with whom Humboldt, and\r\nmost writers since, have confounded them.{*} See his Essai politique,\r\ntom. i. p. 414; ii. p. 37.\r\n\r\n{*} [Humboldt, strictly speaking, has not confounded the Colhuans\r\nwith the Acolhuans, but has written, in the places cited, the latter\r\nname for the former. “Letzterer Name,” says Buschmann, “ist der\r\nerstere mit dem Zusatz von _atl_ Wasser,--Wasser Colhuer.” (Uber die\r\naztekischen Ortsnamen, S. 690.) Yet the two tribes, according to the\r\nsame authority, were entirely distinct, one alone--though which, he\r\nis unable to determine--being of the Nahuatlac race.

(See his Discorsi sopra T. Livio,\r\nlib. 2, cap. 4, apud Opere (Geneva, 1798).) This, as we have seen\r\nabove, was the very course pursued by the Mexicans.\r\n\r\n[41] Ixtlilxochitl, Hist. Chich., MS., cap. 36.\r\n\r\n[42] [Robertson, in his History of America, was the first man to\r\nquestion the correctness of the judgment passed by the Spanish\r\nchroniclers upon the Aztec institutions. Subsequent American writers\r\ngave louder expression to his doubts. As has been said in the notes\r\nupon the preceding chapter, Mr. Morgan proved conclusively that the\r\nso-called “empire” was no empire at all, but only a confederacy of\r\nthree tribes. Mr. Morgan, however, was sometimes led into inaccuracy\r\nand extravagance of statement because of his desire to place all the\r\nAmerican aborigines on the same institutional plane.\r\n\r\nAdolf Bandelier, pupil and disciple of Morgan, persevering and accurate\r\nscholar, investigated the subject in an entirely unprejudiced way\r\nand with a thoroughness which forces men to place almost implicit\r\nconfidence in his conclusions. It is well here to summarize those\r\nconclusions.\r\n\r\nThe Mexican confederacy was made up of three tribes, the Aztecs, the\r\nTezcucans, and the Tlacopans, who dwelt in neighboring pueblos.\r\n\r\nOf these tribes the Aztecs and Tezcucans were superior to the\r\nTlacopans. Spoils of war were always divided into five portions. The\r\nTlacopans took one, their allies shared equally the other four parts.\r\nThe Indian pueblos generally were designed to withstand a protracted\r\nsiege, but the Mexican pueblos were almost impregnable. It is not\r\nlikely that any other Indian tribes could have captured them. Dwelling\r\nsecurely in these great communal houses, which were also fortresses,\r\nthe Aztec confederacy held many other tribes in subjection. It was\r\nonly necessary for it to send its agents to other pueblos to secure\r\nat once the specified tribute. Failure to pay this tribute brought\r\nsummary punishment at the hands of the warriors of the confederacy. The\r\n“empire” was “only a partnership formed for the purpose of carrying\r\non the business of warfare, and that intended, not for the extension\r\nof territorial ownership, but only for an increase of the means of\r\nsubsistence.” The subject peoples were never incorporated into the\r\nconfederacy. The tribe remained intact. The houses the tribe occupied\r\nwere common property, and so was the land cultivated. Neither land\r\nnor houses could be sold, and as the tribe increased in numbers new\r\ncommunal houses were built to accommodate the increase. The great\r\nfortress-dwellings in a, for savages, well-cultivated land prevented\r\nthe subdivision of tribes which was constantly taking place in wilder\r\nNorth America.\r\n\r\nTwenty clans, organized into four phratries, made up of the Aztec\r\ntribe. The clans were called “calpullis.” They were governed by a\r\ncouncil of chiefs, “tecuhtli,” elected by the clan. There was an\r\nofficial head, the “calpullac,” whose duties were mainly civil, and\r\nalso a military leader, the “ohcacautin” (“elder brother”). Painful\r\nreligious ordeals accompanied the initiation of these men into office.\r\nClan officers held their places during good behavior. Medicinemen, or\r\npriests, were members of the clan council. To the four phratries into\r\nwhich the clan was divided four quarters of the city of Mexico, each\r\nunder its own captain, were assigned. Their titles were “man of the\r\nhouse of darts,” “chief of the eagle and cactus,” “blood-shedder,” and\r\n“cutter of men.” Of these captains the “chief of the eagle and cactus”\r\nwas chief executioner. Their principal duty was to maintain order both\r\nwithin and without the pueblo. In each of these four quarters was an\r\narmory (“house of darts”), in which the weapons of the phratry were\r\nkept when its warriors were not engaged in warfare. The phratry was in\r\nMexico primarily a military organization.\r\n\r\nTwenty members, one from each clan, made up the tribal council which\r\nexercised supreme control over the Aztec tribe. The member who was\r\nchosen to represent the clan was called “tlatoani,” the “speaker,” and\r\nthe council was called “tlatocan,” the “place of speech.” Sessions of\r\nthe council were regularly held every ten days, and every eighty days\r\nan extra session was convened, to which the twenty “ohcacautins,” the\r\nfour captains of the phratries, the two civil executives of the tribe,\r\nand some others were summoned. Its decisions were final.\r\n\r\nAs the clan had its civil head, or calpullac, so the tribe had a\r\ncorresponding officer, the cihuacoatl, or “female snake.” The “snake\r\nwoman” was always a man. He was chief judge of the clan and was\r\nelected for life by the tribal council. The “snake woman” was second\r\nin command to the “chief of men,” or tlacatecuhtli, the head war\r\nchief. While at first head war chief of the Aztecs, about the year\r\n1430 the tlacatecuhtli was made head war chief and commander of the\r\nconfederacy. Montezuma was “chief of men,” and the Spaniards saw him\r\nsurrounded with such state that they not unnaturally supposed him to\r\nbe king of the Aztecs. Montezuma’s position, however, was not at all\r\nthat of a king, and most of the royal functions fell to the lot of the\r\n“snake woman.” Bandelier thinks the “chief of men” was only the chief\r\nmilitary officer. He was elected by the “elder brothers” (ohcacautins)\r\nof the clans, the tribal council, and the leading priests, sitting in\r\nassembly. A principle of succession seems to have confined the election\r\nto members of a special clan. Moreover, from four officers--namely,\r\na member of the priesthood called the “man of the dark house,”\r\nand the phratry captains called respectively “man of the house of\r\ndarts,” “blood-shedder,” and “cutter of men”--the “chief of men” was\r\nalways chosen. He exercised certain priestly functions after his\r\nelection. His first official act was to offer incense to the war god\r\nHuitzilopochtli.{*} Montezuma was “priest commander” as well as “chief\r\nof men.”\r\n\r\n{*} [Bancroft, Native Races of the Pacific States, vol. ii. p. 145.]\r\n\r\n\r\nThe “chief of men” held office during good behavior. He was, ex\r\nofficio, a member of the tribal council, but he had little to do within\r\nthe tribe limits. His functions were exercised outside the confederacy,\r\nand his special duty was to superintend the collection of tribute. His\r\nagents, called “crop-gatherers” (calpixqui), were appointed by the\r\ntribal council. It was their duty to visit the subject pueblos and\r\nto gather the tribute--maize, weapons, pottery, feather-work, female\r\nslaves, victims for sacrifice, or anything else which suited the\r\nvictor’s fancy. The prisoners were forced to carry the other tribute to\r\nthe tecpan, or tribal house, and were accompanied by couriers who saw\r\nthat the tribute was duly delivered according to the directions given\r\nin picture-writing by the “crop-gatherers.” The office of calpixqui was\r\nmost dangerous, being practically that of spy. All these institutions\r\nthe Spanish historians noted without understanding. They supposed\r\nthat there was a standing army; but every male was born a warrior,\r\nand so the people were the army. There was no nobility of any kind in\r\nMexico. Merit alone determined the appointment to office. “No office\r\nwhatever, no kind of dignity, was among the Mexicans transmissible by\r\ninheritance.”\r\n\r\nAbove the common warriors of the clan were two higher classes,\r\nthe “distinguished braves” and the war chiefs proper. Among the\r\n“distinguished braves” were three classes, arranged according to\r\nattainments, none of the braves being elected, but all winning their\r\nplace by valor. The war chiefs were elected. The “snake woman,” or\r\n“female snake,” acted as a check upon the head war chief, or “chief\r\nof men.” The two alternately took charge of forays. The elaborate\r\ndecorations which adorned the “chief of men” in his official capacity\r\nmay be seen represented in the sculptures at Palenque, especially upon\r\nthe “tablet of the cross.”\r\n\r\nThe Aztecs conducted no long campaigns, and were not successful in\r\nprotracted sieges, while they were always able to make a successful\r\ndefence against enemies of their own class. Their pyramidal\r\ntemples--teocalli--were admirable fortresses. In Mexico itself the\r\ncauseways were essentially military constructions, and not simply\r\nroads to connect the city with the mainland. Captives taken in forays\r\nwere “collared,” that is, they were secured by wooden collars fastened\r\nupon their necks. If they were specially unruly, and were continually\r\nstriving to escape, the tendons of their feet were cut.\r\n\r\nAs the tribes increased new “calpullis” were formed and new communal\r\nhouses were built. The Spaniards took it for granted that the tribal\r\ngovernment which exercised authority over tribal soil could alienate\r\nthat soil, but this was not the case. It was not until communal soil\r\nwas done away with that private ownership was established.\r\n\r\nMr. Bandelier reaches the following conclusions:\r\n\r\n1. Abstract ownership either by the state or the individual was unknown.\r\n\r\n2. Right of possession was vested in the kin, or clan. The idea of\r\nalienation was never entertained.\r\n\r\n3. Individuals only held the right to use certain lots.\r\n\r\n4. No rights of possession were attached to any office or chieftaincy.\r\n\r\n5. For tribal business certain lands were set apart independent of\r\npersons.\r\n\r\n6. Conquest was followed not by annexation or apportionment, but by\r\ntribute.\r\n\r\n7. Feudalism could not prevail under these conditions.\r\n\r\nOf the kin, or clan, it should be noted that, first, the kin claimed\r\nthe right to name its members; second, it was the duty of the kin to\r\neducate its members; third, it was accustomed to regulate marriage;\r\nfourth, one attribute of the kin was the right of common burial; fifth,\r\nthe kin had to protect its members; sixth, it exercised the right of\r\nelecting its officers and of deposing them. (Montezuma, “chief of men,”\r\nwas deposed before he died.)--M.\r\n\r\n[43] This was an exception.--In Egypt, also, the king was frequently\r\ntaken from the warrior caste, though obliged afterwards to be\r\ninstructed in the mysteries of the priesthood: ὁ δὲ ἐκ μαχίμων\r\nἀποδεδειγένος εὐθὺς ἐγίνετο τῶν ίέρων.

No two writers agree.\r\n\r\n[49] [There was, according to Bandelier, no such thing as a\r\n“body-guard.” Guards were unknown. This was evidenced when Montezuma\r\nwas captured. No “body-guard” attempted his rescue. Bandelier’s\r\nconclusions should be kept steadily in mind in reading this chapter.\r\nThe “distinct class of nobles, with large landed possessions,” were\r\nonly the principal officers of the tribe, who were of course of the\r\nsame “kin” as the so-called Aztec monarch.

There\r\ncould not be where the communism which the clan system implies\r\nprevailed. Feudalism was a social-political system based upon land.\r\nUnder it there was a well-defined gradation of ranks, and each lower\r\nwas bound to the next higher order by protection given in return for\r\nservice rendered. Moreover, where feudalism prevailed the ownership\r\nof the land was vested in one person while the occupancy belonged to\r\nanother. Feudalism exalted the individual and assured to each man his\r\n_rights_. The clan knew nothing whatever of individual rights. When the\r\nconception of personal ownership was developed, and kinship ceased to\r\nbe the bond which held men together, the clan system of communal living\r\nof necessity passed away. But among the Aztecs the feudal conception\r\nof personal property never was developed.

This is strong\r\nlanguage. Yet no one had better means of knowing than this eminent\r\njurist, who for nineteen years held a post in the royal _audiences_\r\nof New Spain. During his long residence in the country he had ample\r\nopportunity of acquainting himself with its usages, both through his\r\nown personal observation and intercourse with the natives, and through\r\nthe first missionaries who came over after the Conquest. On his return\r\nto Spain, probably about 1560, he occupied himself with an answer to\r\nqueries which had been propounded by the government, on the character\r\nof the Aztec laws and institutions, and on that of the modifications\r\nintroduced by the Spaniards. Much of his treatise is taken up with the\r\nlatter subject. In what relates to the former he is more brief than\r\ncould be wished, from the difficulty, perhaps, of obtaining full and\r\nsatisfactory information as to the details. As far as he goes, however,\r\nhe manifests a sound and discriminating judgment. He is very rarely\r\nbetrayed into the extravagance of expression so visible in the writers\r\nof the time; and this temperance, combined with his uncommon sources\r\nof information, makes his work one of highest authority on the limited\r\ntopics within its range. The original manuscript was consulted by\r\nClavigero, and, indeed, has been used by other writers.

See Gama’s learned exposition of the devices on the statue\r\nof the goddess found in the great square of Mexico. (Descripcion de\r\nlas Dos Piedras (México, 1832), Parte 1, pp. 34-44.) The tradition\r\nrespecting the origin of this god, or, at least, his appearance on\r\nearth, is curious. He was born of a woman. His mother, a devout person,\r\none day, in her attendance on the temple, saw a ball of bright-colored\r\nfeathers floating in the air. She took it, and deposited it in her\r\nbosom. She soon after found herself pregnant, and the dread deity was\r\nborn, coming into the world, like Minerva, all armed,--with a spear\r\nin the right hand, a shield in the left, and his head surmounted by a\r\ncrest of green plumes. (See Clavigero, Stor. del Messico, tom. ii. p.\r\n19, et seq.) A similar notion in respect to the incarnation of their\r\nprincipal deity existed among the people of India beyond the Ganges, of\r\nChina, and of Thibet. “Budh,” says Milman, in his learned and luminous\r\nwork on the history of Christianity, “according to a tradition known\r\nin the West, was born of a virgin. So were the Fohi of China, and the\r\nSchakaof of Thibet, no doubt the same, whether a mythic or a real\r\npersonage. The Jesuits in China, says Barrow, were appalled at finding\r\nin the mythology of that country the counterpart of the Virgo Deipara.”\r\n(Vol. i. p. 99, note.) The existence of similar religious ideas in\r\nremote regions, inhabited by different races, is an interesting subject\r\nof study, furnishing, as it does, one of the most important links in\r\nthe great chain of communication which binds together the distant\r\nfamilies of nations.\r\n\r\n{*} [The name may possibly have referred to the whispered oracles\r\nand intimations in dreams--such as “a little bird of the air” is\r\nstill fabled to convey--by which, according to the legend, the deity\r\nhad guided his people in their migrations and conquests. That it\r\nhad a symbolical meaning will hardly be doubted, and M. Brasseur\r\nde Bourbourg, who had originally explained it as “Huitzil the\r\nLeft-handed,”--the proper name of a deified hero with the addition\r\nof a descriptive epithet,--has since found one of too deep an import\r\nto be briefly expounded or easily understood. (Quatre Lettres sur le\r\nMexique (Paris, 1868), p. 201, et al.) _Mexitl_, another name of the\r\nsame deity, is translated “the hare of the aloes.” In some accounts the\r\ntwo are distinct personages. Mythological science rejects the legend,\r\nand regards the Aztec war-god as a “nature-deity,” a personification of\r\nthe lightning, this being a natural type of warlike might, of which the\r\ncommon symbol, the serpent, was represented among the decorations of\r\nthe idol. (Myths of the New World, p. 118.) More commonly he has been\r\nidentified with the sun, and Mr. Tylor, while declining “to attempt a\r\ngeneral solution of this inextricable compound parthenogenetic deity,”\r\nnotices the association of his principal festival with the winter’s\r\nsolstice, and the fact that his paste idol was then shot through with\r\nan arrow, as tending to show that the life and death of the deity were\r\nemblematic of the year’s, “while his functions of war-god may have been\r\nof later addition.” Primitive Culture, tom. ii. 279.--K.]\r\n\r\n[102] [For the Aztec myths our most valuable authority is the Historia\r\nde los Méxicanos por sus Pinturas, by Ramirez de Fuen-leal.

His\r\nprincipal sojourn was at Cholula. See also Payne, New World Called\r\nAmerica, vol. i. pp. 588-596.

In this rather startling conjecture he is supported by several\r\nof his devout countrymen, who appear to have as little doubt of the\r\nfact as of the advent of St. James, for a similar purpose, in the\r\nmother-country. See the various authorities and arguments set forth\r\nwith becoming gravity in Dr. Mier’s dissertation in Bustamante’s\r\nedition of Sahagun (lib. 3, Suplem.), and Veytia (tom. i. pp. 160-200).\r\nOur ingenious countryman McCulloh carries the Aztec god up to a still\r\nmore respectable antiquity, by identifying him with the patriarch Noah.\r\nResearches, Philosophical and Antiquarian, concerning the Aboriginal\r\nHistory of America (Baltimore, 1829), p. 233.{*}\r\n\r\n{*} [Under the modern system of mythical interpretation, which has\r\nbeen applied by Dr. Brinton with singular force and ingenuity to\r\nthe traditions of the New World, Quetzalcoatl, “the central figure\r\nof Toltec mythology,” with the corresponding figures found in the\r\nlegends of the Mayas, Quichés, Peruvians, and other races, loses all\r\npersonal existence, and becomes a creation of that primitive religious\r\nsentiment which clothed the uncomprehending powers of nature with the\r\nattributes of divinity. His name, “Bird-Serpent,” unites the emblems\r\nof the wind and the lightning. “He is both lord of the eastern light\r\nand the winds. As the former, he was born of a virgin in the land of\r\nTula or Tlapallan, in the distant Orient, and was high-priest of that\r\nhappy realm. The morning star was his symbol.... Like all the dawn\r\nheroes, he too was represented as of white complexion, clothed in long\r\nwhite robes, and, as most of the Aztec gods, with a full and flowing\r\nbeard. When his earthly work was done, he too returned to the east,\r\nassigning as a reason that the sun, the ruler of Tlapallan, demanded\r\nhis presence. But the real motive was that he had been overcome by\r\nTezcatlipoca, otherwise called Yoalliehecatl, the wind or spirit of the\r\nnight, who had descended from heaven by a spider’s web and presented\r\nhis rival with a draught pretended to confer immortality, but, in fact,\r\nproducing uncontrollable longing for home. For the wind and the light\r\nboth depart when the gloaming draws near, or when the clouds spread\r\ntheir dark and shadowy webs along the mountains and pour the vivifying\r\nrain upon the fields.... Wherever he went, all manner of singing birds\r\nbore him company, emblems of the whistling breezes. When he finally\r\ndisappeared in the far east, he sent back four trusty youths, who had\r\never shared his fortunes, incomparably swift and light of foot, with\r\ndirections to divide the earth between them and rule it till he should\r\nreturn and resume his power.” (The Myths of the New World, p. 180, et\r\nseq.) So far as mere physical attributes are concerned, this analysis\r\nmay be accepted as a satisfactory elucidation of the class of figures\r\nto which it relates. But the grand and distinguishing characteristic of\r\nthese figures is the moral and intellectual eminence ascribed to them.\r\nThey are invested with the highest qualities of humanity,--attributes\r\nneither drawn from the external phenomena of nature nor born of any\r\nrude sentiment of wonder and fear. Their lives and doctrines are in\r\nstrong contrast with those of the ordinary divinities of the same or\r\nother lands, and they are objects not of a propitiatory worship, but\r\nof a pious veneration. Can we, then, assent to the conclusion that\r\nunder this aspect also they were “wholly mythical,” “creations of the\r\nreligious fancy,” “ideals summing up in themselves the best traits,\r\nthe most approved virtues, of whole nations”? (Ibid., pp. 293, 294.)\r\nThis would seem to imply that nations may attain to lofty conceptions\r\nof moral truth and excellence by a process of selection, without any\r\nstandard or point of view furnished by living embodiments of the ideal.\r\nBut this would be as impossible as to arrive at conceptions of the\r\nhighest forms and ideas of art independently of the special genius and\r\nactual productions of the artist. In the one case, as in the other, the\r\nideal is derived originally from examples shaped by finer and deeper\r\nintuitions than those of the masses. “Im Anfang war die That.” The mere\r\nfact, therefore, that the Mexican people recognized an exalted ideal of\r\npurity and wisdom is a sufficient proof that men had existed among them\r\nwho displayed these qualities in an eminent degree. The status of their\r\ncivilization, imperfect as it was, can be accounted for only in the\r\nsame way. Comparative mythology may resolve into its original elements\r\na personification of the forces of nature woven by the religious fancy\r\nof primitive races, but it cannot sever that chain of discoverers and\r\ncivilizers by which mankind has been drawn from the abysses of savage\r\nignorance, and by which its progress, when uninterrupted, has been\r\nalways maintained.--K.]\r\n\r\n[104] Cod.

Torquemada\r\nturns this into 20,000 _infants_. (Monarch. Ind., lib. 7, cap. 21.)\r\nHerrera, following Acosta, says 20,000 victims on a specified day of\r\nthe year, throughout the kingdom. (Hist. general, dec. 2, lib. 2,\r\ncap. 16.) Clavigero, more cautious, infers that this number may have\r\nbeen sacrificed annually throughout Anahuac. (Ubi supra.) Las Casas,\r\nhowever, in his reply to Sepulveda’s assertion, that no one who had\r\nvisited the New World put the number of yearly sacrifices at less than\r\n20,000, declares that “this is the estimate of brigands, who wish to\r\nfind an apology for their own atrocities, and that the real number was\r\nnot above 50”! (Œuvres, ed. Llorente (Paris, 1822), tom. i. pp. 365,\r\n386.) Probably the good Bishop’s arithmetic here, as in most other\r\ninstances, came more from his heart than his head. With such loose\r\nand contradictory data, it is clear that any specific number is mere\r\nconjecture, undeserving the name of calculation.\r\n\r\n[132] I am within bounds. Torquemada states the number, most precisely,\r\nat 72,344 (Monarch. Ind., lib. 2, cap. 63); Ixtlilxochitl, with equal\r\nprecision, at 80,400. (Hist. Chich., MS.) _¿Quien sabe?_ The latter\r\nadds that the captives massacred in the capital, in the course of that\r\nmemorable year, exceeded 100,000! (Loc. cit.) One, however, has to read\r\nbut a little way, to find out that the science of numbers--at least\r\nwhere the party was not an eyewitness--is anything but an exact science\r\nwith these ancient chroniclers. The Codex Telleriano-Remensis, written\r\nsome fifty years after the Conquest, reduces the amount to 20,000.\r\n(Antiq. of Mexico, vol. i. Pl. 19; vol. vi. p. 141, Eng. note.) Even\r\nthis hardly warrants the Spanish interpreter in calling king Ahuitzotl\r\na man “of a mild and moderate disposition,” _templada y benigna\r\ncondicion_! Ibid., vol. v. p. 49.\r\n\r\n[133] Gomara states the number on the authority of two soldiers, whose\r\nnames he gives, who took the trouble to count the grinning horrors in\r\none of these Golgothas, where they were so arranged as to produce the\r\nmost hideous effect. The existence of these conservatories is attested\r\nby every writer of the time.\r\n\r\n[134] The “Anonymous Conqueror” assures us, as a fact beyond dispute,\r\nthat the Devil introduced himself into the bodies of the idols, and\r\npersuaded the silly priests that his only diet was human hearts! It\r\nfurnishes a very satisfactory solution, to his mind, of the frequency\r\nof sacrifices in Mexico. Rel. d’un gentil’ huomo, ap. Ramusio, tom.\r\niii. fol. 307.\r\n\r\n[135] The Tezcucan priests would fain have persuaded the good king\r\nNezahualcoyotl, on occasion of a pestilence, to appease the gods by\r\nthe sacrifice of some of his own subjects, instead of his enemies; on\r\nthe ground that they would not only be obtained more easily, but would\r\nbe fresher victims, and more acceptable. (Ixtlilxochitl, Hist. Chich.,\r\nMS., cap. 41.) This writer mentions a cool arrangement entered into by\r\nthe allied monarchs with the republic of Tlascala and her confederates.\r\nA battle-field was marked out, on which the troops of the hostile\r\nnations were to engage at stated seasons, and thus supply themselves\r\nwith subjects for sacrifice. The victorious party was not to pursue his\r\nadvantage by invading the other’s territory, and they were to continue,\r\nin all other respects, on the most amicable footing. (Ubi supra.) The\r\nhistorian, who follows in the track of the Tezcucan Chronicler, may\r\noften find occasion to shelter himself, like Ariosto, with\r\n\r\n    “Mettendolo Turpin, lo metto anch’ io.”\r\n\r\n\r\n[136] [Don José F. Ramirez, the distinguished Mexican scholar, has\r\nmade this sentence the text for a disquisition of fifty pages or\r\nmore, one object of which is to show that the existence of human\r\nsacrifices is not irreconcilable with an advance in civilization. This\r\nleads him into an argument of much length, covering a broad range of\r\nhistorical inquiry, and displaying much learning as well as a careful\r\nconsideration of the subject. In one respect, however, he has been led\r\ninto an important error by misunderstanding the drift of my remarks,\r\nwhere, speaking of cannibalism, I say, “It is impossible the people who\r\npractise it should make any great progress in moral or intellectual\r\nculture” (p. 100). This observation, referring solely to cannibalism,\r\nthe critic cites as if applied by me to human sacrifices. Whatever\r\nforce, therefore, his reasoning may have in respect to the latter, it\r\ncannot be admitted to apply to the former. The distance is wide between\r\nhuman sacrifices and cannibalism; though Señor Ramirez diminishes\r\nthis distance by regarding both one and the other simply as religious\r\nexercises, springing from the devotional principle in our nature.{*}\r\nHe enforces his views by a multitude of examples from history, which\r\nshow how extensively these revolting usages of the Aztecs--on a much\r\nless gigantic scale indeed--have been practised by the primitive races\r\nof the Old World, some of whom, at a later period, made high advances\r\nin civilization. Ramirez, Notas y Esclarecimientos á la Historia del\r\nConquista de México del Señor W. Prescott, appended to Navarro’s\r\ntranslation.]\r\n\r\n{*} [The practise of eating, or tasting, the victim has been generally\r\nassociated with sacrifice, from the idea either of the sacredness of\r\nthe offering or of the deity’s accepting the soul, the immaterial part,\r\nor the blood as containing the principle of life and leaving the flesh\r\nto his worshippers.--K.]\r\n\r\n[137] Rel. d’un gentil’ huomo, ap. Ramusio, tom. iii. fol. 307.--Among\r\nother instances is that of Chimalpopoca, third king of Mexico, who\r\ndoomed himself, with a number of his lords, to this death, to wipe off\r\nan indignity offered him by a brother monarch. (Torquemada, Monarch.\r\nInd., lib. 2, cap. 28.) This was the law of honor with the Aztecs.\r\n\r\n[138] [“The advancement of Mexico rested for support on ... a system of\r\nperpetual war, remorselessly maintained against neighboring peoples,\r\nostensibly to procure victims for sacrifice, but really to provide\r\nanimal food for consumption by the privileged class engaged in it; and\r\nthe religious ritual had been so expanded as to ensure for them, by a\r\nsacred and permanent sanction, an almost continuous cannibal carnival.”\r\nPayne, New World Called America, vol. i. p. 300. Mr. Payne shows that\r\nthis continuous cannibalism prevailed because Anahuac possessed no\r\nlarge animals capable of furnishing a regular food supply. “Organized\r\ncannibalism, fortified by its religious sanction, was in fact a natural\r\nif not a necessary outgrowth of circumstances.”--M.]\r\n\r\n[139] Voltaire, doubtless, intends this, when he says, “Ils n’étaient\r\npoint anthropophages, comme un très-petit nombre de peuplades\r\nAméricaines.” (Essai sur les Mœurs, chap. 147.)\r\n\r\n[140] [The remark in the text admits of some qualification. According\r\nto an ancient Tezcucan chronicler, quoted by Señor Ramirez, the Toltecs\r\ncelebrated occasionally the worship of the god Tlaloc with human\r\nsacrifices. The most important of these was the offering up once a\r\nyear of five or six maidens, who were immolated in the usual horrid\r\nway of tearing out their hearts. It does not appear that the Toltecs\r\nconsummated the sacrifice by devouring the flesh of the victim. This\r\nseems to have been the only exception to the blameless character of\r\nthe Toltec rites. Tlaloc was the oldest deity in the Aztec mythology,\r\nin which he found a suitable place. Yet, as the knowledge of him was\r\noriginally derived from the Toltecs, it cannot be denied that this\r\npeople, as Ramirez says, possessed in their peculiar civilization the\r\ngerms of those sanguinary institutions which existed on so appalling a\r\nscale in Mexico. See Ramirez, Notas y Esclarecimientos, ubi supra.]\r\n\r\n[141] Ixtlilxochitl, Hist.

Machiavelli attributes to a\r\nsimilar cause, in part, the military successes of the Romans. (Discorsi\r\nsopra T. Livio, lib. 2, cap. 2.)

(See Champollion, Précis du\r\nSystème hiéroglyphique des anciens Égyptiens (Paris, 1824), pp. 242,\r\n281.) It may seem more strange that the enchorial alphabet, so much\r\nmore commodious, should not have been substituted. But the Egyptians\r\nwere familiar with their hieroglyphics from infancy, which, moreover,\r\ntook the fancies of the most illiterate, probably in the same manner as\r\nour children are attracted and taught by the picture-alphabets in an\r\nordinary spelling-book.\r\n\r\n[146] Descripcion histórica y cronológica de las Dos Piedras (México,\r\n1832), Parte 2, p. 39.\r\n\r\n[147] Gama, Descripcion, Parte 2, pp. 32, 44.--Acosta, lib. 6, cap.\r\n7.--The continuation of Gama’s work, recently edited by Bustamante, in\r\nMexico, contains, among other things, some interesting remarks on the\r\nAztec hieroglyphics.

The reader would scarcely understand from it that\r\nthere are rarely more than one or two facts recorded in any year,\r\nand sometimes not one in a dozen or more.

Chich., MS., Prólogo.\r\n\r\n[154] According to Boturini, the ancient Mexicans were acquainted\r\nwith the Peruvian method of recording events by means of the\r\n_quippus_,--knotted strings of various colors,--which were afterwards\r\nsuperseded by hieroglyphical painting. (Idea, p. 86.) He could\r\ndiscover, however, but a single specimen, which he met with in\r\nTlascala, and that had nearly fallen to pieces with age. McCulloh\r\nsuggests that it may have been only a wampum belt, such as is\r\ncommon among our North American Indians. (Researches, p. 201.)\r\nThe conjecture is plausible enough. Strings of wampum, of various\r\ncolors, were used by the latter people for the similar purpose of\r\nregistering events. The insulated fact, recorded by Boturini, is hardly\r\nsufficient--unsupported, so far as I know, by any other testimony--to\r\nestablish the existence of _quippus_ among the Aztecs, who had but\r\nlittle in common with the Peruvians.\r\n\r\n[155] Pliny, who gives a minute account of the _papyrus_ reed of Egypt,\r\nnotices the various manufactures obtained from it, as ropes, cloth,\r\npaper, etc. It also served as a thatch for the roofs of houses, and as\r\nfood and drink for the natives.

It\r\nwas sent to the Emperor Charles the Fifth, not long after the Conquest,\r\nby the viceroy Mendoza, Marques de Mondejar. The vessel fell into the\r\nhands of a French cruiser, and the manuscript was taken to Paris. It\r\nwas afterwards bought by the chaplain of the English embassy, and,\r\ncoming into the possession of the antiquary Purchas, was engraved,\r\n_in extenso_, by him, in the third volume of his “Pilgrimage.” After\r\nits publication, in 1625, the Aztec original lost its importance,\r\nand fell into oblivion so completely that, when at length the public\r\ncuriosity was excited in regard to its fate, no trace of it could\r\nbe discovered. Many were the speculations of scholars, at home and\r\nabroad, respecting it, and Dr. Robertson settled the question as to\r\nits existence in England, by declaring that there was no Mexican relic\r\nin that country, except a golden goblet of Montezuma. (History of\r\nAmerica (London, 1796), vol. iii. p. 370.) Nevertheless, the identical\r\nCodex, and several other Mexican paintings, have been since discovered\r\nin the Bodleian Library. The circumstance has brought some obloquy\r\non the historian, who, while prying into the collections of Vienna\r\nand the Escorial, could be so blind to those under his own eyes.\r\nThe oversight will not appear so extraordinary to a thorough-bred\r\ncollector, whether of manuscripts, or medals, or any other rarity. The\r\nMendoza Codex is, after all, but a copy, coarsely done with a pen on\r\nEuropean paper. Another copy, from which Archbishop Lorenzana engraved\r\nhis tribute-rolls in Mexico, existed in Boturini’s collection. A third\r\nis in the Escorial, according to the Marquis of Spineto. (Lectures on\r\nthe Elements of Hieroglyphics (London), Lect. 7.) This may possibly be\r\nthe original painting. The entire Codex, copied from the Bodleian maps,\r\nwith its Spanish and English interpretations, is included in the noble\r\ncompilation of Lord Kingsborough. (Vols. i., v., vi.) It is distributed\r\ninto three parts, embracing the civil history of the nation, the\r\ntributes paid by the cities, and the domestic economy and discipline of\r\nthe Mexicans, and, from the fulness of the interpretation, is of much\r\nimportance in regard to these several topics.\r\n\r\n[163] It formerly belonged to the Giustiniani family, but was so\r\nlittle cared for that it was suffered to fall into the mischievous\r\nhands of the domestics’ children, who made sundry attempts to burn it.\r\nFortunately, it was painted on deerskin, and, though somewhat singed,\r\nwas not destroyed. (Humboldt, Vues des Cordillères, p. 89, et seq.) It\r\nis impossible to cast the eye over this brilliant assemblage of forms\r\nand colors without feeling how hopeless must be the attempt to recover\r\na key to the Aztec mythological symbols; which are here distributed\r\nwith the symmetry, indeed, but in all the endless combinations, of the\r\nkaleidoscope. It is in the third volume of Lord Kingsborough’s work.\r\n\r\n[164] Humboldt, who has copied some pages of it in his “Atlas\r\npittoresque,” intimates no doubt of its Aztec origin. (Vues des\r\nCordillères, pp. 266, 267.) M. Le Noir even reads in it an exposition\r\nof Mexican Mythology, with occasional analogies to that of Egypt and\r\nof Hindostan. (Antiquités Mexicaines, tom, ii., Introd.) The fantastic\r\nforms of hieroglyphic symbols may afford analogies for almost anything.\r\n\r\n[165] The history of this Codex, engraved entire in the third volume\r\nof the “Antiquities of Mexico,” goes no further back than 1739, when\r\nit was purchased at Vienna for the Dresden Library. It is made of the\r\nAmerican _agave_. The figures painted on it bear little resemblance,\r\neither in feature or form, to the Mexican. They are surmounted by a\r\nsort of head-gear, which looks something like a modern peruke. On the\r\nchin of one we may notice a beard, a sign often used after the Conquest\r\nto denote a European. Many of the persons are sitting cross-legged. The\r\nprofiles of the faces, and the whole contour of the limbs, are sketched\r\nwith a spirit and freedom very unlike the hard, angular outlines of the\r\nAztecs. The characters, also, are delicately traced, generally in an\r\nirregular but circular form, and are very minute. They are arranged,\r\nlike the Egyptian, both horizontally and perpendicularly, mostly in\r\nthe former manner, and, from the prevalent direction of the profiles,\r\nwould seem to have been read from right to left. Whether phonetic\r\nor ideographic, they are of that compact and purely conventional\r\nsort which belongs to a well-digested system for the communication\r\nof thought. One cannot but regret that no trace should exist of the\r\nquarter whence this MS. was obtained; perhaps some part of Central\r\nAmerica, from the region of the mysterious races who built the\r\nmonuments of Mitla and Palenque; though, in truth, there seems scarcely\r\nmore resemblance in the symbols to the Palenque _bas-reliefs_ than to\r\nthe Aztec paintings.{*}\r\n\r\n{*} [Mr. Stephens, who, like Humboldt, considered the Dresden Codex\r\na Mexican manuscript, compared the characters of it with those on\r\nthe altar of Copan, and drew the conclusion that the inhabitants of\r\nthat place and of Palenque must have spoken the same language as the\r\nAztecs. Prescott’s opinion has, however, been confirmed by later\r\ncritics, who have shown that the hieroglyphics of the Dresden Codex are\r\nquite different from those at Copan and Palenque, while the Mexican\r\nwriting bears not the least resemblance to either. See Orozco y Berra,\r\nGeografia de las Lenguas de México, p. 101.-K.]\r\n\r\n[166] There are three of these: the Mendoza Codex; the\r\nTelleriano-Remensis,--formerly the property of Archbishop Teller,--in\r\nthe Royal Library of Paris; and the Vatican MS., No. 3738. The\r\ninterpretation of the last bears evident marks of its recent origin;\r\nprobably as late as the close of the sixteenth or the beginning of the\r\nseventeenth century, when the ancient hieroglyphics were read with the\r\neye of faith rather than of reason. Whoever was the commentator (comp.\r\nVues des Cordillères, pp. 203, 204; and Antiq. of Mexico, vol. vi. pp.\r\n155, 222), he has given such an exposition as shows the Aztecs to have\r\nbeen as orthodox Christians as any subjects of the Pope.\r\n\r\n[167] The total number of Egyptian hieroglyphics discovered by\r\nChampollion amounts to 864; and of these 130 only are phonetic,\r\nnotwithstanding that this kind of character is used far more frequently\r\nthan both the others.

If we are to believe Bustamante, however, a complete key to\r\nthe whole system is, at this moment, _somewhere_ in Spain.

(Hist. de Nueva-España, lib. 4, Apend.)\r\nBut this author, however good an authority for the superstitions, is an\r\nindifferent one for the science of the Mexicans.\r\n\r\n[183] The Persians had a cycle of one hundred and twenty years, of\r\nthree hundred and sixty-five days each, at the end of which they\r\nintercalated thirty days. (Humboldt, Vues des Cordillèras, p. 177.)\r\nThis was the same as thirteen after the cycle of fifty-two years of the\r\nMexicans, but was less accurate than their probable intercalation of\r\ntwelve days and a half. It is obviously indifferent, as far as accuracy\r\nis concerned, which multiple of four is selected to form the cycle;\r\nthough, the shorter the interval of intercalation, the less, of course,\r\nwill be the temporary departure from the true time.\r\n\r\n[184] This is the conclusion to which Gama arrives, after a very\r\ncareful investigation of the subject. He supposes that the “bundles,”\r\nor cycles, of fifty-two years--by which, as we shall see, the Mexicans\r\ncomputed time--ended alternately at midnight and midday. (Descripcion,\r\nParte 1, p. 52, et seq.) He finds some warrant for this in Acosta’s\r\naccount (lib. 6, cap. 2), though contradicted by Torquemada (Monarch.\r\nInd., lib. 5, cap. 33), and, as it appears, by Sahagun,--whose work,\r\nhowever, Gama never saw (Hist. de Nueva-España, lib. 7, cap. 9),--both\r\nof whom place the close of the year at midnight. Gama’s hypothesis\r\nderives confirmation from a circumstance I have not seen noticed.\r\nBesides the “bundle” of fifty-two years, the Mexicans had a larger\r\ncycle of one hundred and four years, called “an old age.” As this was\r\nnot used in their reckonings, which were carried on by their “bundles,”\r\nit seems highly probable that it was designed to express the period\r\nwhich would bring round the commencement of the smaller cycles to the\r\nsame hour, and in which the intercalary days, amounting to twenty-five,\r\nmight be comprehended without a fraction.\r\n\r\n[185] This length, as computed by Zach, at 365d. 5h. 48m. 48sec.,\r\nis only 2m. 9sec. longer than the Mexican; which corresponds with\r\nthe celebrated calculation of the astronomers of the Caliph Almamon,\r\nthat fell short about two minutes of the true time. See La Place,\r\nExposition, p. 350.\r\n\r\n[186] “El corto exceso de 4hor. 38min. 40seg., que hay de mas de los 25\r\ndias en el período de 104 años, no puede componer un dia entero, hasta\r\nque pasen mas de cinco de estos períodos máximos ó 538 años.” (Gama,\r\nDescripcion, Parte 1, p. 23.) Gama estimates the solar year at 365d.\r\n5h. 48m. 50sec.\r\n\r\n[187] The ancient Etruscans arranged their calendar in cycles of 110\r\nsolar years, and reckoned the year at 365d. 5h. 40m.; at least this\r\nseems probable, says Niebuhr.

The early Romans had not wit enough\r\nto avail themselves of this accurate measurement, which came within\r\nnine minutes of the true time. The Julian reform, which assumed 365d.\r\n5¼h. as the length of the year, erred as much, or rather more, on\r\nthe other side. And when the Europeans, who adopted this calendar,\r\nlanded in Mexico, their reckoning was nearly eleven days in advance of\r\nthe exact time,--or, in other words, of the reckoning of the barbarous\r\nAztecs;{*} a remarkable fact.--Gama’s researches led to the conclusion\r\nthat the year of the new cycle began with the Aztecs on the ninth of\r\nJanuary; a date considerably earlier than that usually assigned by\r\nthe Mexican writers. (Descripcion, Parte 2, pp. 49-52.) By postponing\r\nthe intercalation to the end of fifty-two years, the annual loss of\r\nsix hours made every fourth year begin a day earlier. Thus, the cycle\r\ncommencing on the ninth of January, the fifth year of it began on the\r\neighth, the ninth year on the seventh, and so on; so that the last day\r\nof the series of fifty-two years fell on the twenty-sixth of December,\r\nwhen the intercalation of thirteen days rectified the chronology and\r\ncarried the commencement of the new year to the ninth of January again.\r\nTorquemada, puzzled by the irregularity of the new-year’s day, asserts\r\nthat the Mexicans were unacquainted with the annual excess of six\r\nhours, and therefore never intercalated! (Monarch. Ind., lib. 10, cap.\r\n36.) The interpreter of the Vatican Codex has fallen into a series of\r\nblunders on the same subject, still more ludicrous. (Antiq. of Mexico,\r\nvol. vi. Pl. 16.) So soon had Aztec science fallen into oblivion after\r\nthe Conquest!\r\n\r\n{*} [See also Wilson, Prehistoric Man, i. p. 246.--M.]\r\n\r\n[188] These hieroglyphics were a “rabbit,” a “reed,” a “flint,” a\r\n“house.” They were taken as symbolical of the four elements, air,\r\nwater, fire, earth, according to Veytia. (Hist. antig., tom. i. cap.\r\n5.) It is not easy to see the connection between the terms “rabbit” and\r\n“air,” which lead the respective series.{*}\r\n\r\n{*} [The fleet and noiseless motions of the animal seem to offer an\r\nobvious explanation of the symbol.--K.]\r\n\r\n[189] The following table of two of the four indictions of thirteen\r\nyears each will make the text more clear. The first column shows\r\nthe actual year of the great cycle, or “bundle.” The second, the\r\nnumerical dots used in their arithmetic. The third is composed of their\r\nhieroglyphics for rabbit, reed, flint, house, in their regular order.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nBy pursuing the combinations through the two remaining indictions, it\r\nwill be found that the same number of dots will never coincide with\r\nthe same hieroglyphic. These tables are generally thrown into the\r\nform of wheels, as are those also of their months and days, having a\r\nvery pretty effect. Several have been published, at different times,\r\nfrom the collections of Siguenza and Boturini. The wheel of the great\r\ncycle of fifty-two years is encompassed by a serpent, which was also\r\nthe symbol of “an age,” both with the Persians and Egyptians. Father\r\nToribio seems to misapprehend the nature of these chronological wheels:\r\n“Tenian rodelas y escudos, y en ellas pintadas las figuras y armas de\r\nsus Demonios con su blason.” Hist. de los Indios, MS., Parte 1, cap. 4.\r\n\r\n[190] Among the Chinese, Japanese, Moghols, Mantchous, and other\r\nfamilies of the Tartar race. Their series are composed of symbols of\r\ntheir five elements, and the twelve zodiacal signs, making a cycle\r\nof sixty years’ duration. Their several systems are exhibited, in\r\nconnection with the Mexican, in the luminous pages of Humboldt (Vues\r\ndes Cordillères, p. 149), who draws important consequences from the\r\ncomparison, to which we shall have occasion to return hereafter.\r\n\r\n[191] In this calendar, the months of the tropical year were\r\ndistributed into cycles of thirteen days, which, being repeated twenty\r\ntimes,--the number of days in a solar month,--completed the lunar, or\r\nastrological, year of 260 days; when the reckoning began again. “By\r\nthe contrivance of these _trecenas_ (terms of thirteen days) and the\r\ncycle of fifty-two years,” says Gama, “they formed a luni-solar period,\r\nmost exact for astronomical purposes.” (Descripcion, Parte 1, p. 27.)\r\nHe adds that these _trecenas_ were suggested by the periods in which\r\nthe moon is visible before and after conjunction. (Loc. cit.) It seems\r\nhardly possible that a people capable of constructing a calendar so\r\naccurately on the true principles of solar time should so grossly err\r\nas to suppose that in this reckoning they really “represented the daily\r\nrevolutions of the moon.” “The whole Eastern world,” says the learned\r\nNiebuhr, “has followed the moon in its calendar; the free scientific\r\ndivision of a vast portion of time is peculiar to the West. Connected\r\nwith the West is that primeval extinct world which we call the New.”\r\nHistory of Rome, vol. i. p. 239.\r\n\r\n[192] They were named “companions,” and “lords of the night,” and were\r\nsupposed to preside over the night, as the other signs did over the\r\nday. Boturini, Idea, p. 57.\r\n\r\n[193] Thus, their astrological year was divided into months of thirteen\r\ndays; there were thirteen years in their indictions, which contained\r\neach three hundred and sixty-five periods of thirteen days, etc. It\r\nis a curious fact that the number of lunar months of thirteen days\r\ncontained in a cycle of fifty-two years, with the intercalation,\r\nshould correspond precisely with the number of years in the great\r\nSothic period of the Egyptians, namely, 1491; a period in which the\r\nseasons and festivals came round to the same place in the year again.\r\nThe coincidence may be accidental. But a people employing periodical\r\nseries and astrological calculations have generally some meaning in the\r\nnumbers they select and the combinations to which they lead.\r\n\r\n[194] According to Gama (Descripcion, Parte 1, pp. 75, 76), because 369\r\ncan be divided by nine without a fraction; the nine “companions” not\r\nbeing attached to the five complementary days. But 4, a mystic number\r\nmuch used in their arithmetical combinations, would have answered the\r\nsame purpose equally well. In regard to this, McCulloh observes, with\r\nmuch shrewdness, “It seems impossible that the Mexicans, so careful\r\nin constructing their cycle, should abruptly terminate it with 360\r\nrevolutions, whose natural period of termination is 2340.” And he\r\nsupposes the nine “companions” were used in connection with the cycles\r\nof 260 days, in order to throw them into the larger ones, of 2340;\r\neight of which, with a ninth of 260 days, he ascertains to be equal to\r\nthe great solar period of 52 years. (Researches, pp. 207, 208.) This is\r\nvery plausible. But in fact the combinations of the two first series,\r\nforming the cycle of 260 days, were always interrupted at the end of\r\nthe year, since each new year began with the same hieroglyphic of the\r\ndays. The third series of the “companions” was intermitted, as above\r\nstated, on the five unlucky days which closed the year, in order, if we\r\nmay believe Boturini, that the first day of the solar year might have\r\nannexed to it the first of the nine “companions,” which signified “lord\r\nof the year” (Idea, p. 57); a result which might have been equally\r\nwell secured, without any intermission at all, by taking 5, another\r\nfavorite number, instead of 9, as the divisor. As it was, however, the\r\ncycle, as far as the third series was concerned, did terminate with 360\r\nrevolutions. The subject is a perplexing one, and I can hardly hope to\r\nhave presented it in such a manner as to make it perfectly clear to the\r\nreader.\r\n\r\n[195] Hist. de Nueva-España, lib. 4, Introd.\r\n\r\n[196] “Dans les pays les plus différents,” says Benjamin Constant,\r\nconcluding some sensible reflections on the sources of the sacerdotal\r\npower, “chez les peuples de mœurs les plus opposées, le sacerdoce a dû\r\nau culte des éléments et des astres un pouvoir dont aujourd’hui nous\r\nconcevons à peine l’idée.” De la Religion (Paris, 1825), lib. 3, ch. 5.\r\n\r\n[197]\r\n\r\n    “It is a gentle and affectionate thought.\r\n     That, in immeasurable heights above us,\r\n     At our first birth the wreath of love was woven\r\n     With sparkling stars for flowers.”\r\n                  COLERIDGE: Translation of Wallenstein, act 2, sc. 4.\r\n\r\nSchiller is more true to poetry than history, when he tells us, in the\r\nbeautiful passage of which this is part, that the worship of the stars\r\ntook the place of classic mythology. It existed long before it.\r\n\r\n[198] Gama has given us a complete almanac of the astrological year,\r\nwith the appropriate signs and divisions, showing with what scientific\r\nskill it was adapted to its various uses. (Descripcion, Parte 1,\r\npp. 25-31, 62-76.) Sahagun has devoted a whole book to explaining\r\nthe mystic import and value of these signs, with a minuteness that\r\nmay enable one to cast up a scheme of nativity for himself. (Hist.\r\nde Nueva-España, lib. 4.) It is evident he fully believed the magic\r\nwonders which he told. “It was a deceitful art,” he says, “pernicious\r\nand idolatrous, and was never contrived by human reason.” The good\r\nfather was certainly no philosopher.\r\n\r\n[199] See, among others, the Cod. Tel.-Rem., Part 4, Pl. 22, ap. Antiq.\r\nof Mexico, vol. i.\r\n\r\n[200] “It can hardly be doubted,” says Lord Kingsborough, “that the\r\nMexicans were acquainted with many scientific instruments of strange\r\ninvention, as compared with our own; whether the _telescope_ may not\r\nhave been of the number is uncertain; but the thirteenth plate of M.\r\nDupaix’s _Monuments_, Part Second, which represents a man holding\r\nsomething of a similar nature to his eye, affords reason to suppose\r\nthat they knew how to improve the powers of vision.” (Antiq. of Mexico,\r\nvol. vi. p. 15, note.) The instrument alluded to is rudely carved on\r\na conical rock. It is raised no higher than the neck of the person\r\nwho holds it, and looks--to my thinking--as much like a musket as a\r\ntelescope; though I shall not infer the use of fire-arms among the\r\nAztecs from this circumstance. (See vol. iv. Pl. 15.) Captain Dupaix,\r\nhowever, in his commentary on the drawing, sees quite as much in it as\r\nhis lordship.

(Essai politique, tom. ii. p. 487, et\r\nseq.) This opinion has brought on him a rather sour rebuke from our\r\ncountryman the late Dr. Perrine, who pronounces them a distinct species\r\nfrom the American _agave_, and regards one of the kinds, the _pita_,\r\nfrom which the fine thread is obtained, as a totally distinct genus.\r\n(See the Report of the Committee on Agriculture.) Yet the Baron may\r\nfind authority for all the properties ascribed by him to the maguey,\r\nin the most accredited writers who have resided more or less time in\r\nMexico.

It was seized by the Mexican officials and sent to\r\nthe city of Mexico. There, in the courtyard of the National Museum,\r\nit may be seen to-day, just opposite its exact duplicate, which was\r\nfound buried, either in the plaza of Mexico or somewhere in Tlaxcala,\r\nsome years ago.

The natives of Hispaniola, being the first with whom\r\nthe Spaniards had much intercourse, have supplied Europe with the names\r\nof several important plants.--Tobacco, in some form or other, was used\r\nby almost all the tribes of the American continent, from the Northwest\r\nCoast to Patagonia. (See McCulloh, Researches, pp. 91-94.) Its manifold\r\nvirtues, both social and medicinal, are profusely panegyrized by\r\nHernandez, in his Hist. Plantarum, lib. 2, cap. 109.\r\n\r\n[257] This noble bird was introduced into Europe from Mexico. The\r\nSpaniards called it _gallopavo_, from its resemblance to the peacock.\r\nSee Rel. d’un gentil’ huomo, ap. Ramusio (tom. iii. fol. 306); also\r\nOviedo (Rel. Sumaria, cap. 38), the earliest naturalist who gives an\r\naccount of the bird, which he saw soon after the Conquest, in the\r\nWest Indies, whither it had been brought, as he says, from New Spain.\r\nThe Europeans, however, soon lost sight of its origin, and the name\r\n“turkey” intimated the popular belief of its Eastern origin. Several\r\neminent writers have maintained its Asiatic or African descent; but\r\nthey could not impose on the sagacious and better-instructed Buffon.\r\n(See Histoire naturelle, art. _Dindon_.) The Spaniards saw immense\r\nnumbers of turkeys in the domesticated state, on their arrival in\r\nMexico, where they were more common than any other poultry. They were\r\nfound wild, not only in New Spain, but all along the continent, in\r\nthe less frequented places, from the Northwestern territory of the\r\nUnited States to Panamá. The wild turkey is larger, more beautiful,\r\nand every way an incomparably finer bird than the tame. Franklin, with\r\nsome point, as well as pleasantry, insists on its preference to the\r\nbald eagle as the national emblem. (See his Works, vol. x. p. 63, in\r\nSparks’s excellent edition.) Interesting notices of the history and\r\nhabits of the wild turkey may be found in the Ornithology both of\r\nBuonaparte and of that enthusiastic lover of nature, Audubon, _vox\r\nMeleagris_, _Gallopavo_.\r\n\r\n[258] Sahagun, Hist. de Nueva-España, lib. 4, cap. 37; lib. 8, cap. 13;\r\nlib. 9, cap. 10-14.--Torquemada, Monarch.

It had the consistency almost\r\nof a solid; and the “Anonymous Conqueror” is very careful to inculcate\r\nthe importance of “opening the mouth wide, in order to facilitate\r\ndeglutition, that the foam may dissolve gradually, and descend\r\nimperceptibly, as it were, into the stomach.” It was so nutritious that\r\na single cup of it was enough to sustain a man through the longest\r\nday’s march.

Indeed,\r\nthere was more or less dancing at most of the festivals, and it was\r\nperformed in the court-yards of the houses, or in the open squares of\r\nthe city. (Ibid., ubi supra.) The principal men had, also, buffoons and\r\njugglers in their service, who amused them and astonished the Spaniards\r\nby their feats of dexterity and strength (Acosta, lib. 6, cap. 28; also\r\nClavigero (Stor. del Messico, tom. ii. pp. 179-186), who has designed\r\nseveral representations of their exploits, truly surprising). It is\r\nnatural that a people of limited refinement should find their enjoyment\r\nin material rather than intellectual pleasures, and, consequently,\r\nshould excel in them. The Asiatic nations, as the Hindoos and Chinese,\r\nfor example, surpass the more polished Europeans in displays of agility\r\nand legerdemain.\r\n\r\n[262] “Y de esta manera pasaban gran rato de la noche, y se despedian,\r\né iban á sus casas, unos alabando la fiesta, y otros murmurando de las\r\ndemasías y excesos, cosa mui ordinaria en los que á semejantes actos se\r\njuntan.” Torquemada, Monarch.

To\r\nuse the words of Bandelier (Archæological Tour in Mexico, p. 192):\r\n“Ixtlilxochitl is always a very suspicious authority, not because he is\r\nmore confused than any other Indian writer, but because he wrote for an\r\ninterested object, and with the view of sustaining tribal claims in the\r\neyes of the Spanish government.”--M.]\r\n\r\n[264] For a criticism on this writer, see the Postscript to this\r\nchapter.\r\n\r\n[265] See Chapter I. of this Introduction, p. 17.\r\n\r\n[266] Ixtlilxochitl, Relaciones, MS., No. 9.--Idem, Hist.

DE IXTLILXOCHITL.\r\n\r\nThe sentiment, which is common enough, is expressed with uncommon\r\nbeauty by the English poet Herrick:\r\n\r\n    “Gather the rosebuds while you may;\r\n      Old Time is still a-flying;\r\n     The fairest flower that blooms to-day\r\n      To-morrow may be dying.”\r\n\r\nAnd with still greater beauty, perhaps, by Racine:\r\n\r\n    “Rions, chantons, dit cette troupe impie,\r\n     De fleurs en fleurs, de plaisirs en plaisirs,\r\n                 Promenons nos désirs.\r\n     Sur l’avenir insensé qui se fie.\r\n     De nos ans passagers le nombre est incertain.\r\n     Hâtons-nous aujourd’hui de jouir de la vie;\r\n     Qui sait si nous serons demain?”\r\n                 ATHALIE, Acte 2.\r\n\r\nIt is interesting to see under what different forms the same sentiment\r\nis developed by different races and in different languages. It is an\r\nEpicurean sentiment, indeed, but its universality proves its truth to\r\nnature.\r\n\r\n[290] Some of the provinces and places thus conquered were held by the\r\nallied powers in common; Tlacopan, however, only receiving one-fifth\r\nof the tribute. It was more usual to annex the vanquished territory\r\nto that one of the two great states to which it lay nearest. See\r\nIxtlilxochitl, Hist. Chich., MS., cap. 38.--Zurita, Rapport, p. 11.\r\n\r\n[291] Ixtlilxochitl, Hist. Chich., MS., cap. 41. The same writer, in\r\nanother work, calls the population of Tezcuco, at this period, double\r\nof what it was at the Conquest; founding his estimate on the royal\r\nregisters, and on the numerous remains of edifices still visible in\r\nhis day, in places now depopulated. “Parece en las historias que en\r\neste tiempo, antes que se destruyesen, havia doblado mas gente de la\r\nque halló al tiempo que vino Cortés, y los demas Españoles: porque yo\r\nhallo en los padrones reales, que el menor pueblo tenía 1100 vecinos,\r\ny de allí para arriba, y ahora no tienen 200 vecinos, y aun en algunas\r\npartes de todo punto se han acabado.... Como se hecha de ver en las\r\nruinas, hasta los mas altos montes y sierras tenian sus sementeras, y\r\ncasas principales para vivir y morar.” Relaciones, MS., No. 9.\r\n\r\n[292] Torquemada has extracted the particulars of the yearly\r\nexpenditure of the palace from the royal account-book, which came\r\ninto the historian’s possession. The following are some of the items,\r\nnamely: 4,900,300 fanegas of maize (the _fanega_ is equal to about\r\none hundred pounds); 2,744,000 fanegas of cacao; 8000 turkeys; 1300\r\nbaskets of salt; besides an incredible quantity of game of every kind,\r\nvegetables, condiments, etc. (Monarch. Ind., lib. 2, cap. 53.) See,\r\nalso, Ixtlilxochitl, Hist. Chich., MS., cap. 35.\r\n\r\n[293] There were more than four hundred of these lordly residences:\r\n“Así mismo hizo edificar muchas casas y palacios para los señores y\r\ncavalleros, que asistian en su corte, cada uno conforme á la calidad y\r\nméritos de su persona, las quales llegáron á ser mas de quatrocientas\r\ntasas de señores y cavalleros de solar conocido.” Ibid., cap. 38.\r\n\r\n[294] Bancroft, Native Races, vol. ii. p. 162, points out a mistake in\r\ntranslation here, Prescott having made the _estado_ the same measure as\r\nthe vara. The wall was _three times a man’s stature_ for one half its\r\ncircumference and _five times a man’s stature_ for the other half.--M.\r\n\r\n[295] Ixtlilxochitl, Hist. Chich., MS., cap. 36. “Esta plaza cercada\r\nde portales, y tenia así mismo por la parte del poniente otra sala\r\ngrande, y muchos quartos á la redonda, que era la universidad, en\r\ndonde asistian todos los poetas, históricos, y philósophos del reyno,\r\ndivididos en sus claves, y academias, conforme era la facultad de cada\r\nuno, y así mismo estaban aquí los archivos reales.”\r\n\r\n[296] The reader who is familiar with the history of the Moors in Spain\r\nmust inevitably be reminded of the palace in Cordova when he peruses\r\nthese pages.--M.\r\n\r\n[297] This celebrated naturalist was sent by Philip II to New Spain,\r\nand he employed several years in compiling a voluminous work on its\r\nvarious natural productions, with drawings illustrating them. Although\r\nthe government is said to have expended sixty thousand ducats in\r\neffecting this great object, the volumes were not published till long\r\nafter the author’s death. In 1651 a mutilated edition of the part of\r\nthe work relating to medical botany appeared at Rome.--The original\r\nMSS. were supposed to have been destroyed by the great fire in the\r\nEscorial, not many years after. Fortunately, another copy, in the\r\nauthor’s own hand, was detected by the indefatigable Muñoz, in the\r\nlibrary of the Jesuits’ College at Madrid, in the latter part of the\r\nlast century; and a beautiful edition, from the famous press of Ibarra,\r\nwas published in that capital, under the patronage of government, in\r\n1790. (Hist. Plantarum, Præfatio.--Nic. Antonio, Bibliotheca Hispana\r\nNova (Matriti, 1790), tom. iii. p. 432.) The work of Hernandez is a\r\nmonument of industry and erudition, the more remarkable as being the\r\nfirst on this difficult subject. And, after all the additional light\r\nfrom the labors of later naturalists, it still holds its place as a\r\nbook of the highest authority, for the perspicuity, fidelity, and\r\nthoroughness with which the multifarious topics in it are discussed.\r\n\r\n[298] Ixtlilxochitl, Hist. Chich., MS., cap. 36.\r\n\r\n[299] “Some of the terraces on which it stood,” says Mr. Bullock,\r\nspeaking of this palace, “are still entire, and covered with cement,\r\nvery hard, and equal in beauty to that found in ancient Roman\r\nbuildings.... The great church, which stands close by, is almost\r\nentirely built of the materials taken from the palace, many of the\r\nsculptured stones from which may be seen in the walls, though most of\r\nthe ornaments are turned inwards. Indeed, our guide informed us that\r\nwhoever built a house at Tezcuco made the ruins of the palace serve as\r\nhis quarry.” (Six Months in Mexico, chap. 26.) Torquemada notices the\r\nappropriation of the materials to the same purpose. Monarch. Ind., lib.\r\n2, cap. 45.\r\n\r\n[300] Ixtlilxochitl, MS., ubi supra.\r\n\r\n[301] Thus, to punish the Chalcas for their rebellion, the whole\r\npopulation were compelled, women as well as men, says the chronicler so\r\noften quoted, to labor on the royal edifices for four years together;\r\nand large granaries were provided with stores for their maintenance in\r\nthe mean time. Ixtlilxochitl, Hist.

Chich., MS., cap. 37.\r\n\r\n[304] The Egyptian priests managed the affair in a more courtly style,\r\nand, while they prayed that all sorts of kingly virtues might descend\r\non the prince, they threw the blame of actual delinquencies on his\r\nministers; thus, “not by the bitterness of reproof,” says Diodorus,\r\n“but by the allurements of praise, enticing him to an honest way of\r\nlife.” Lib. 1, cap. 70.\r\n\r\n[305] Ixtlilxochitl, Hist.

Those\r\nwhich were not cut in the rock were crumbling into ruins, as, indeed,\r\nevery part of the establishment was even then far gone to decay.\r\n\r\n[307] On the summit of the mount, according to Padilla, stood an image\r\nof a _coyotl_,--an animal resembling a fox,--which, according to\r\ntradition, represented an Indian famous for his fasts. It was destroyed\r\nby that stanch iconoclast, Bishop Zumárraga, as a relic of idolatry.\r\n(Hist. de Santiago, lib. 2, cap. 81.) This figure was, no doubt, the\r\nemblem of Nezahualcoyotl himself, whose name, as elsewhere noticed,\r\nsignified “hungry fox.”{*}\r\n\r\n{*} [“Fasting coyote.” This animal, “resembling a fox,” is familiar\r\nenough to those who dwell in our far Western States.--M.]\r\n\r\n[308] [Bancroft, Native Races, ii. p. 171, says these figures were not\r\nstatues but were all cut on the face of the rock border.--M.]\r\n\r\n[309] “Hecho de una peña un leon de mas de dos brazas de largo con\r\nsus alas y plumas: estaba hechado y mirando á la parte del oriente,\r\nen cuia boca asomaba un rostro, que era el mismo retrato del Rey.”\r\nIxtlilxochitl, Hist. Chich., MS., cap. 42.\r\n\r\n[310] Bullock speaks of a beautiful basin, twelve feet long by eight\r\nwide, having a well five feet by four deep in the centre, etc., etc.\r\nWhether truth lies in the bottom of this well is not so clear. Latrobe\r\ndescribes the baths as “two singular basins, perhaps two feet and a\r\nhalf in diameter, not large enough for any monarch bigger than Oberon\r\nto take a duck in.” (Comp. Six Months in Mexico, chap. 26; and Rambler\r\nin Mexico, Let. 7.) Ward speaks much to the same purpose (Mexico\r\nin 1827 (London, 1828), vol. ii. p. 296), which agrees with verbal\r\naccounts I have received of the same spot.{*}\r\n\r\n{*} [Mayer, “Mexico as it Was and Is,” gives a picture of this “bath,”\r\np. 234.--M.]\r\n\r\n[311] “Gradas hechas de la misma peña tan bien gravadas y lizas que\r\nparecian espejos.” (Ixtlilxochitl, MS., ubi supra.) The travellers just\r\ncited notice the beautiful polish still visible in the porphyry.\r\n\r\n[312] Padilla saw entire pieces of cedar among the ruins, ninety feet\r\nlong and four in diameter. Some of the massive portals, he observed,\r\nwere made of a single stone. (Hist. de Santiago, lib. 11, cap. 81.)\r\nPeter Martyr notices an enormous wooden beam, used in the construction\r\nof the palaces of Tezcuco, which was one hundred and twenty feet long\r\nby eight feet in diameter! The accounts of this and similar huge pieces\r\nof timber were so astonishing, he adds, that he could not have received\r\nthem except on the most unexceptionable testimony. De Orbe Novo, dec.\r\n5, cap. 10.{*}\r\n\r\n{*} [Those who have seen the giant Sequoias of California can easily\r\nbelieve in those “enormous wooden beams.” The “Grizzly Giant,” still\r\nstanding in the Mariposa grove, is two hundred and seventy-five\r\nfeet high and considerably more than thirty feet in diameter at the\r\nground. Eleven feet from the ground it is more than sixty-four feet in\r\ncircumference. The Sequoias were not discovered until almost ten years\r\nafter Prescott wrote this note.--M.]\r\n\r\n[313] It is much to be regretted that the Mexican government should\r\nnot take a deeper interest in the Indian antiquities. What might not\r\nbe effected by a few hands drawn from the idle garrisons of some of\r\nthe neighboring towns and employed in excavating this ground, “the\r\nMount Palatine” of Mexico! But, unhappily, the age of violence has been\r\nsucceeded by one of apathy.\r\n\r\n[314] “They are doubtless,” says Mr. Latrobe, speaking of what he calls\r\n“these inexplicable ruins,” “rather of Toltec than Aztec origin, and,\r\nperhaps, with still more probability, attributable to a people of an\r\nage yet more remote.” (Rambler in Mexico, Let. 7.) “I am of opinion,”\r\nsays Mr. Bullock, “that these were antiquities prior to the discovery\r\nof America, and erected by a people whose history was lost even before\r\nthe building of the city of Mexico.--Who can solve this difficulty?”\r\n(Six Months in Mexico, ubi supra.) The reader who takes Ixtlilxochitl\r\nfor his guide will have no great trouble in solving it. He will find\r\nhere, as he might, probably, in some other instances, that one need go\r\nlittle higher than the Conquest for the origin of antiquities which\r\nclaim to be coeval with Phœnicia and ancient Egypt.\r\n\r\n[315] Zurita, Rapport, p. 12.\r\n\r\n[316] Ixtlilxochitl, Hist.

Corren los\r\nrios, los arroyos, las fuentes, y las aguas, y ningunas retroceden para\r\nsus alegres nacimientos: aceléranse con ansia para los vastos dominios\r\nde Tlulóca [Neptuno], y cuanto mas se arriman á sus dilatadas márgenes,\r\ntanto mas van labrando las melancólicas urnas para sepultarse.

(Tardes Americanas (México, 1778), p. 90, et\r\nseq.) The original is in the Otomi tongue, and both, together with\r\na French version, have been inserted by M. Ternaux-Compans in the\r\nAppendix to his translation of Ixtlilxochitl’s Hist. des Chichimèques\r\n(tom. i. pp. 359-367). Bustamante, who has, also, published the Spanish\r\nversion in his Galería de antiguos Príncipes Mejicanos (Puebla, 1821,\r\npp. 16, 17), calls it the “Ode of the Flower,” which was recited at\r\na banquet of the great Tezcucan nobles. If this last, however, be\r\nthe same mentioned by Torquemada (Monarch. Ind., lib. 2, cap. 45),\r\nit must have been written in the Tezcucan tongue; and, indeed, it is\r\nnot probable that the Otomi, an Indian dialect, so distinct from the\r\nlanguages of Anahuac, however well understood by the royal poet, could\r\nhave been comprehended by a miscellaneous audience of his countrymen.\r\n\r\n[333] An approximation to a date is the most one can hope to arrive at\r\nwith Ixtlilxochitl, who has entangled his chronology in a manner beyond\r\nmy skill to unravel. Thus, after telling us that Nezahualcoyotl was\r\nfifteen years old when his father was slain in 1418, he says he died at\r\nthe age of seventy-one, in 1462. _Instar omnium._ Comp. Hist.

(See Ixtlilxochitl, Hist. Chich., MS., cap. 45.)\r\nI have explained the meaning of the equally euphonious name of his\r\nparent, Nezahualcoyotl. (_Ante_, ch. 4.)

Such,\r\nhowever, is the theory maintained by M. Brasseur de Bourbourg, who\r\ndates the event “six or seven thousand years ago,” and believes that\r\nthe traditions of it have been faithfully preserved. This is the great\r\ncataclysm with which all mythology begins. It may be traced through\r\nthe myths of Greece, Egypt, India, and America, all being identical\r\nand having a common origin. It is the subject of the _Teo-Amoxtli_,\r\nof which several of the Mexican manuscripts, the Borgian and Dresden\r\nCodices in particular, are the hieroglyphical transcriptions, and\r\nof which “the actual letter,” “in the Nahuatlac language,” is found\r\nin a manuscript in Boturini’s Collection. This manuscript is “in\r\nappearance” a history of the Toltecs and of the kings of Colhuacan and\r\nMexico; but “under the ciphers of a fastidious chronology, under the\r\nrecital more or less animated of the Toltec history, are concealed the\r\nprofoundest mysteries concerning the geological origin of the world in\r\nits existing form and the cradle of the religions of antiquity.” The\r\nToltecs are “telluric powers, agents of the subterranean fire;” they\r\nare identical with the Cabiri, who reappear as the Cyclops, having\r\n“hollowed an eye in their forehead; that is to say, raised themselves\r\nwith masses of earth above the surface and filled the craters of\r\nthe volcanoes with fire.” “The Chichimecs and the Aztecs are also\r\nsymbolical names, borrowed from the forces of nature.” Tollan, “the\r\nmarshy or reedy place,” was “the low, fertile region” now covered by\r\nthe Gulf of Mexico. Quetzalcoatl is “merely the personification of the\r\nland swallowed up by the ocean.” Tlapallan, Aztlan, and other names\r\nare similarly explained. Osiris, Pan, Hercules, and Bacchus have their\r\nrespective parts assigned to them; for “not only all the sources of\r\nancient mythology, but even the most mysterious details, even the\r\nobscurest enigmas, with which that mythology is enveloped, are to be\r\nsought in the two mediterraneans hollowed out by the cataclysm, and\r\nin the islands, great and small, which separate them from the ocean.”\r\n(Quatre Lettres sur le Mexique.) There can be no refutation of such a\r\ntheory, or of the assumptions on which it rests; but it may be proper\r\nto remark that its author has not succeeded in deciphering a single\r\nhierogiyphical character, and has published no translation of the real\r\nor supposed _Teo-Amoxtli_,--a point on which some misapprehension seems\r\nto exist.--K.]\r\n\r\n[353] Count Carli shows much ingenuity and learning in support of the\r\nfamous Egyptian tradition, recorded by Plato in his “Timæus,”--of the\r\ngood faith of which the Italian philosopher nothing doubts.

(See, in particular, Antiquitates Americanæ (Hafniæ, 1837),\r\npp. 79-200.) How far south they penetrated is not so easily settled.\r\n\r\n[359] The most remarkable example, probably, of a direct intercourse\r\nbetween remote points is furnished us by Captain Cook, who found\r\nthe inhabitants of New Zealand not only with the same religion, but\r\nspeaking the same language, as the people of Otaheite, distant more\r\nthan 2000 miles. The comparison of the two vocabularies establishes the\r\nfact.

The five ages in the Grecian cosmogony had\r\nreference to moral rather than physical phenomena,--a proof of higher\r\ncivilization.\r\n\r\n[364] The Chaldean and Hebrew accounts of the Deluge are nearly the\r\nsame. The parallel is pursued in Palfrey’s ingenious Lectures on the\r\nJewish Scriptures and Antiquities (Boston, 1840), vol. ii. lect. 21,\r\n22. Among the pagan writers, none approach so near to the Scripture\r\nnarrative as Lucian, who, in his account of the Greek traditions,\r\nspeaks of the ark, and the pairs of different kinds of animals. (De\r\nDeâ Syriâ, sec. 12.) The same thing is found in the Bhagawatn Purana,\r\na Hindoo poem of great antiquity. (Asiatic Researches, vol. ii. mem.\r\n7.) The simple tradition of a universal inundation was preserved among\r\nmost of the aborigines, probably, of the Western World. See McCulloh,\r\nResearches, p. 147.\r\n\r\n[365] This tradition of the Aztecs is recorded in an ancient\r\nhieroglyphical map, first published in Gemelli Carreri’s Giro del\r\nMondo. (See tom. vi. p. 38, ed. Napoli, 1700.) Its authenticity, as\r\nwell as the integrity of Carreri himself, on which some suspicions\r\nhave been thrown (see Robertson’s America (London, 1796), vol. iii.\r\nnote 26), has been successfully vindicated by Boturini, Clavigero,\r\nand Humboldt, all of whom trod in the steps of the Italian traveller.\r\n(Boturini, Idea, p. 54.--Humboldt, Vues des Cordillères, pp. 223,\r\n224.--Clavigero, Stor. del Messico, tom. i. p. 24.) The map is a\r\ncopy from one in the curious collection of Siguenza. It has all the\r\ncharacter of a genuine Aztec picture, with the appearance of being\r\nretouched, especially in the costumes, by some later artist. The\r\npainting of the four ages, in the Vatican Codex, No. 3730, represents,\r\nalso, the two figures in the boat, escaping the great cataclysm. Antiq.\r\nof Mexico, vol. i. Pl. 7.\r\n\r\n[366] I have met with no other voucher for this remarkable tradition\r\nthan Clavigero (Stor. del Messico, dissert. 1), a good, though\r\ncertainly not the best, authority, when he gives us no reason for\r\nour faith. Humboldt, however, does not distrust the tradition. (See\r\nVues des Cordillères, p. 226.) He is not so skeptical as Vater; who,\r\nin allusion to the stories of the Flood, remarks, “I have purposely\r\nomitted noticing the resemblance of religious notions, for I do not\r\nsee how it is possible to separate from such views every influence\r\nof Christian ideas, if it be only from an imperceptible confusion in\r\nthe mind of the narrator.” Mithridates, oder allgemeine Sprachenkunde\r\n(Berlin, 1812), Theil iii. Abtheil. 3, p. 82, note.\r\n\r\n[367] This story, so irreconcilable with the vulgar Aztec tradition,\r\nwhich admits only two survivors of the Deluge, was still lingering\r\namong the natives of the place on M. de Humboldt’s visit there.\r\n(Vues des Cordillères, pp. 31, 32.) It agrees with that given by the\r\ninterpreter of the Vatican Codex (Antiq. of Mexico, vol. vi. p. 192,\r\net seq.); a writer--probably a monk of the sixteenth century--in whom\r\nignorance and dogmatism contend for mastery. See a precious specimen of\r\nboth, in his account of the Aztec chronology, in the very pages above\r\nreferred to.\r\n\r\n[368] A tradition, very similar to the Hebrew one, existed among the\r\nChaldeans and the Hindoos. (Asiatic Researches, vol. iii. mem. 16.)\r\nThe natives of Chiapa, also, according to the bishop Nuñez de la Vega,\r\nhad a story, cited as genuine by Humboldt (Vues des Cordillères, p.\r\n148), which not only agrees with the Scripture account of the manner in\r\nwhich Babel was built, but with that of the subsequent dispersion and\r\nthe confusion of tongues. A very marvellous coincidence! But who shall\r\nvouch for the authenticity of the tradition? The bishop flourished\r\ntowards the close of the seventeenth century. He drew his information\r\nfrom hieroglyphical maps, and an Indian MS., which Boturini in vain\r\nendeavored to recover. In exploring these, he borrowed the aid of the\r\nnatives, who, as Boturini informs us, frequently led the good man into\r\nerrors and absurdities; of which he gives several specimens. (Idea, p.\r\n116, et seq.)--Boturini himself has fallen into an error equally great,\r\nin regard to a map of this same Cholulan pyramid, which Clavigero\r\nshows, far from being a genuine antique, was the forgery of a later\r\nday. (Stor. del Messico, tom. i. p. 130, nota.) It is impossible to\r\nget a firm footing in the quicksands of tradition. The further we are\r\nremoved from the Conquest, the more difficult it becomes to decide what\r\nbelongs to the primitive Aztec and what to the Christian convert.\r\n\r\n[369] Sahagun, Hist. de Nueva-España, lib. 1, cap. 6; lib. 6, cap. 28,\r\n33.--Torquemada, not content with the honest record of his predecessor,\r\nwhose MS. lay before him, tells us that the Mexican Eve had two\r\nsons, Cain and Abel. (Monarch, Ind., lib. 6, cap. 31.) The ancient\r\ninterpreters of the Vatican and Tellerian Codices add the further\r\ntradition of her bringing sin and sorrow into the world by plucking the\r\nforbidden _rose_ (Antiq. of Mexico, vol. vi., explan. of Pl. 7, 20);\r\nand Veytia remembers to have seen a Toltec or Aztec map representing\r\na garden with a single tree in it, round which was coiled the serpent\r\nwith a human face! (Hist. antig., lib. 1, cap. 1.) After this we may be\r\nprepared for Lord Kingsborough’s deliberate conviction that the “Aztecs\r\nhad a clear knowledge of the Old Testament, and, most probably, of the\r\nNew, though somewhat corrupted by time and hieroglyphics”!

(Native Races, iii.) Brinton (Myths of the New World,\r\npp. 95, 96) quotes authorities to demonstrate in it the four cardinal\r\npoints, the rain-bringers, the symbol of life and health. He was the\r\nfirst writer to connect the Palenque cross with the four cardinal\r\npoints. Charles Rau (Palenque Tablet in U. S. National Museum, in No.\r\n331 Smithsonian Contributions to Knowledge) concludes that it is a\r\nPhallic symbol. Bandelier thinks it was the emblem of fire. Squier\r\ncalls it the tree of life of the Mexicans. Payne (America, ii. p.\r\n86) thinks it was a representation of a human sacrifice to the sun.\r\nThe “cross” is simply the conventional representation of a tree. At\r\nPalenque the bird which surmounts the tree is a turkey. The celebrant,\r\ndecorated with a necklace, makes an offering to the winged deity. The\r\nliving fetish was called Quetzalhuexolotl, and the tree was called “the\r\ntree of the plumed turkey.” The sacrifice presented is a diminutive\r\nhuman figure. The monstrous head which the roots of the tree surround\r\nis human, but with serpentine details. It represents the “Female\r\nSerpent,” the earth goddess to whom the tree owes its growth and\r\nnutrition.\r\n\r\nFather De Roo (America before Columbus, vol. i. ch. xvii, pp. 423-455)\r\nconcludes that “Christ and his cross were known in ancient America.” In\r\nhis subsequent chapters he describes remains of Christian ceremonies,\r\nbaptism, confirmation, a eucharist, confession, penance, etc.--M.]\r\n\r\n[376] Antiquités Mexicaines, exped. 3, Pl. 36.--The figures are\r\nsurrounded by hieroglyphics of most arbitrary character, perhaps\r\nphonetic. (See, also, Herrera, Hist. general, dec. 2, lib. 3, cap.\r\nI.--Gomara, Crónica de la Nueva-España, cap. 15, ap. Barcia, tom. ii.)\r\nMr. Stephens considers that the celebrated “Cozumel Cross,” preserved\r\nat Merida, which claims the credit of being the same originally\r\nworshipped by the natives of Cozumel, is, after all, nothing but a\r\ncross that was erected by the Spaniards in one of their own temples\r\nin that island after the Conquest. The fact he regards as “completely\r\ninvalidating the strongest proof offered at this day that the Cross was\r\nrecognized by the Indians as a symbol of worship.” (Travels in Yucatan,\r\nvol. ii. chap. 20.) But, admitting the truth of this statement, that\r\nthe Cozumel Cross is only a Christian relic, which the ingenious\r\ntraveller has made extremely probable, his inference is by no means\r\nadmissible. Nothing could be more natural than that the friars in\r\nMerida should endeavor to give celebrity to their convent by making\r\nit the possessor of so remarkable a monument as the very relic which\r\nproved, in their eyes, that Christianity had been preached at some\r\nearlier date among the natives. But the real proof of the existence of\r\nthe Cross, as an object of worship, in the New World, does not rest on\r\nsuch spurious monuments as these, but on the unequivocal testimony of\r\nthe Spanish discoverers themselves.\r\n\r\n[377] “Lo recibian con gran reverencia, humiliacion, y lágrimas,\r\ndiciendo que comian la carne de su Dios.” Veytia, Hist. antig. lib. 1,\r\ncap. 18.--Also, Acosta, lib. 5, cap. 24.\r\n\r\n[378] _Ante_, p. 78.--Sahagun, Hist. de Nueva-España, lib. 6, cap.\r\n37.--That the reader may see for himself how like, yet how unlike, the\r\nAztec rite was to the Christian, I give the translation of Sahagun’s\r\naccount, at length: “When everything necessary for the baptism had been\r\nmade ready, all the relations of the child were assembled, and the\r\nmidwife, who was the person that performed the rite of baptism, was\r\nsummoned. At early dawn, they met together in the court-yard of the\r\nhouse. When the sun had risen, the midwife, taking the child in her\r\narms, called for a little earthen vessel of water, while those about\r\nher placed the ornaments which had been prepared for the baptism in the\r\nmidst of the court. To perform the rite of baptism, she placed herself\r\nwith her face towards the west, and immediately began to go through\r\ncertain ceremonies.... After this she sprinkled water on the head of\r\nthe infant, saying, ‘O my child! take and receive the water of the Lord\r\nof the world, which is our life, and is given for the increasing and\r\nrenewing of our body. It is to wash and to purify. I pray that these\r\nheavenly drops may enter into your body, and dwell there; that they may\r\ndestroy and remove from you all the evil and sin which was given to you\r\nbefore the beginning of the world; since all of us are under its power,\r\nbeing all the children of Chalchivitlycue’ [the goddess of water]. She\r\nthen washed the body of the child with water, and spoke in this manner:\r\n‘Whencesoever thou comest, thou that art hurtful to this child, leave\r\nhim and depart from him, for he now liveth anew, and is born anew; now\r\nis he purified and cleansed afresh, and our mother Chalchivitlycue\r\nagain bringeth him into the world.’ Having thus prayed, the midwife\r\ntook the child in both hands, and, lifting him towards heaven, said,\r\n‘O Lord, thou seest here thy creature, whom thou hast sent into this\r\nworld, this place of sorrow, suffering, and penitence. Grant him, O\r\nLord, thy gifts and thine inspiration, for thou art the great God, and\r\nwith thee is the great goddess.’ Torches of pine were kept burning\r\nduring the performance of these ceremonies. When these things were\r\nended, they gave the child the name of some one of his ancestors, in\r\nthe hope that he might shed a new lustre over it. The name was given by\r\nthe same midwife, or priestess, who baptized him.”\r\n\r\n[379] Among Egyptian symbols we meet with several specimens of the\r\nCross. One, according to Justus Lipsius, signified “life to come.” (See\r\nhis treatise, De Cruce (Lutetiæ Parisiorum, 1598), lib. 3, cap. 8.) We\r\nfind another in Champollion’s catalogue, which he interprets “support\r\nor saviour.” (Précis, tom. ii., Tableau gén., Nos. 277, 348.) Some\r\ncurious examples of the reverence paid to this sign by the ancients\r\nhave been collected by McCulloh (Researches, p. 330, et seq.), and by\r\nHumboldt, in his late work, Géographie du Nouveau-Continent, tom. ii.\r\np. 354, et seq.\r\n\r\n[380]\r\n\r\n    “Ante, Deos homini quod conciliare valeret\r\n    _Far_ erat,”\r\n\r\nsays Ovid. (Fastorum, lib. 1, v. 337.) Count Carli has pointed out a\r\nsimilar use of consecrated bread, and wine or water, in the Greek and\r\nEgyptian mysteries. (Lettres Améric., tom. i. let. 27.) See, also,\r\nMcCulloh, Researches, p. 240, et seq.\r\n\r\n[381] Water for purification and other religious rites is frequently\r\nnoticed by the classical writers. Thus, Euripides:\r\n\r\n    “Ἀγνοἴς καθαρμοἴς πρῶτά νιν νίψαι θέλω.\r\n     θάλασσα κλύϛει πάντα τἀνθρώπων κακά.”\r\n           IPHIG.

See Hist. de Nueva-España, Prólogo,--Ixtlilxochitl,\r\nHist. Chich., MS., Pról.,--Boturini, Idea, p. 116.\r\n\r\n[383] The parallel was so closely pressed by Torquemada that he was\r\ncompelled to suppress the chapter containing it, on the publication of\r\nhis book. See the Proemio to the edition of 1723, sec. 2.\r\n\r\n[384] “The devil,” says Herrera, “chose to imitate, in everything,\r\nthe departure of the Israelites from Egypt, and their subsequent\r\nwanderings.” (Hist. general, dec. 3, lib. 3, cap. 10.) But all that has\r\nbeen done by monkish annalist and missionary to establish the parallel\r\nwith the children of Israel falls far short of Lord Kingsborough’s\r\nlearned labors, spread over nearly two hundred folio pages.

His fanciful speculations on the subject of Mexican\r\nmythology may amuse those whom they fail to convince.\r\n\r\n[395] _Ante_, p. 126, et seq.\r\n\r\n[396] This will be better shown by enumerating the zodiacal signs, used\r\nas the _names of the years_ by the Eastern Asiatics. Among the Mongols,\r\nthese were--1, mouse; 2, ox; 3, leopard; 4, hare; 5, crocodile; 6,\r\nserpent; 7, horse; 8, sheep; 9, monkey; 10, hen; 11, dog; 12, hog.\r\nThe Mantchou Tartars, Japanese, and Thibetians have nearly the same\r\nterms, substituting, however, for No. 3, tiger; 5, dragon; 8, goat. In\r\nthe Mexican signs for the names of the days we also meet with _hare_,\r\n_serpent_, _monkey_, _dog_. Instead of the “leopard,” “crocodile,”\r\nand “hen,”--neither of which animals was known in Mexico at the\r\ntime of the Conquest,--we find the _ocelotl_, the _lizard_, and the\r\n_eagle_.--The lunar calendar of the Hindoos exhibits a correspondence\r\nequally extraordinary. Six of the terms agree with those of the Aztecs,\r\nnamely, _serpent_, _cane_, _razor_, _path of the sun_, _dog’s tail_,\r\n_house_. (Humboldt, Vues des Cordillères, p. 152.) These terms, it will\r\nbe observed, are still more arbitrarily selected, not being confined\r\nto animals; as, indeed, the hieroglyphics of the Aztec calendar were\r\nderived indifferently from them, and other objects, like the signs\r\nof our zodiac. These scientific analogies are set in the strongest\r\nlight by M. de Humboldt, and occupy a large and, to the philosophical\r\ninquirer, the most interesting portion of his great work. (Vues des\r\nCordillères, pp. 125-194.) He has not embraced in his tables, however,\r\nthe Mongol calendar, which affords even a closer approximation to the\r\nMexican than that of the other Tartar races. Comp. Ranking, Researches,\r\npp. 370, 371, note.\r\n\r\n[397] There is some inaccuracy in Humboldt’s definition of the\r\n_ocelotl_ as “the tiger,” “the jaguar.” (Ibid., p. 159.) It is smaller\r\nthan the jaguar, though quite as ferocious, and is as graceful and\r\nbeautiful as the leopard, which it more nearly resembles. It is a\r\nnative of New Spain, where the tiger is not known. (See Buffon,\r\nHistoire naturelle (Paris, An VIII), tom. ii., _vox Ocelotl_.) The\r\nadoption of this latter name, therefore, in the Aztec calendar, leads\r\nto an inference somewhat exaggerated.\r\n\r\n[398] Both the Tartars and the Aztecs indicated the year by its\r\nsign; as the “year of the hare” or “rabbit,” etc. The Asiatic signs,\r\nlikewise, far from being limited to the years and months, presided also\r\nover days, and even hours. (Humboldt, Vues des Cordillères, p. 165.)\r\nThe Mexicans had also astrological symbols appropriated to the hours.\r\nGama, Descripcion, Parte 2, p. 117.\r\n\r\n[399] _Ante_, p. 127, note.\r\n\r\n[400] Achilles Tatius notices a custom of the Egyptians,--who, as the\r\nsun descended towards Capricorn, put on mourning, but, as the days\r\nlengthened, their fears subsided, they robed themselves in white, and,\r\ncrowned with flowers, gave themselves up to jubilee, like the Aztecs.\r\nThis account, transcribed by Carli’s French translator, and by M.\r\nde Humboldt, is more fully criticized by M. Jomard in the Vues des\r\nCordillères, p. 309, et seq.\r\n\r\n[401] [See note, _ante_, p. 373.]\r\n\r\n[402] Jefferson (Notes on Virginia (London, 1787), p. 164), confirmed\r\nby Humboldt (Essai politique, tom. i. p. 353). Mr. Gallatin comes to\r\na different conclusion. (Transactions of American Antiquarian Society\r\n(Cambridge, 1836), vol. ii. p. 161.) The great number of American\r\ndialects and languages is well explained by the unsocial nature of a\r\nhunter’s life, requiring the country to be parcelled out into small and\r\nseparate territories for the means of subsistence.\r\n\r\n[403] Philologists have, indeed, detected two curious exceptions,\r\nin the Congo and primitive Basque; from which, however, the Indian\r\nlanguages differ in many essential points. See Du Ponceau’s Report, ap.\r\nTransactions of the Lit. and Hist. Committee of the Am. Phil. Society,\r\nvol. i.\r\n\r\n[404] Vater (Mithridates, Theil iii. Abtheil. 3, p. 70), who fixes\r\non the Rio Gila and the Isthmus of Darien as the boundaries within\r\nwhich traces of the Mexican language were to be discerned. Clavigero\r\nestimates the number of dialects at thirty-five. I have used the more\r\nguarded statement of M. de Humboldt, who adds that fourteen of these\r\nlanguages have been digested into dictionaries and grammars. Essai\r\npolitique, tom. i. p. 352.\r\n\r\n[405] No one has done so much towards establishing this important fact\r\nas that estimable scholar, Mr. Du Ponceau. And the frankness with which\r\nhe has admitted the exception that disturbed his favorite hypothesis\r\nshows that he is far more wedded to science than to system. See an\r\ninteresting account of it, in his prize essay before the Institute,\r\nMémoire sur le Système grammaticale des Langues de quelques Nations\r\nIndiennes de l’Amérique. (Paris, 1838.)\r\n\r\n[406] The Mexican language, in particular, is most flexible; admitting\r\nof combinations so easily that the most simple ideas are often\r\nburied under a load of accessories. The forms of expression, though\r\npicturesque, were thus made exceedingly cumbrous. A “priest,” for\r\nexample, was called _notlazomahuizteopixcatatzin_, meaning “venerable\r\nminister of God, that I love as my father.” A still more comprehensive\r\nword is _amatlacuilolitquitcatlaxtlahuitli_, signifying “the reward\r\ngiven to a messenger who bears a hieroglyphical map conveying\r\nintelligence.”\r\n\r\n[407] See, in particular, for the latter view of the subject, the\r\narguments of Mr. Gallatin, in his acute and masterly disquisition\r\non the Indian tribes; a disquisition that throws more light on the\r\nintricate topics of which it treats than whole volumes that have\r\npreceded it.

Two such are specified on page 10 of that\r\nantiquary’s Catalogue. This map has all the appearance of a genuine\r\nAztec painting, of the rudest character. We may recognize, indeed,\r\nthe symbols of some dates and places, with others denoting the aspect\r\nof the country, whether fertile or barren, a state of war or peace,\r\netc. But it is altogether too vague, and we know too little of the\r\nallusions, to gather any knowledge from it of the course of the Aztec\r\nmigration.--Gemelli Carreri’s celebrated chart contains the names of\r\nmany places on the route, interpreted, perhaps, by Siguenza himself,\r\nto whom it belonged (Giro del Mondo, tom. vi. 56); and Clavigero has\r\nendeavored to ascertain the various localities with some precision.\r\n(Stor. del Messico, tom. i. p. 160, et seq.) But, as they are all\r\nwithin the boundaries of New Spain, and, indeed, south of the Rio\r\nGila, they throw little light, of course, on the vexed question of the\r\nprimitive abodes of the Aztecs.\r\n\r\n[413] This may be fairly gathered from the agreement of the\r\n_traditionary_ interpretations of the maps of the various people of\r\nAnahuac, according to Veytia; who, however, admits that it is “next\r\nto impossible,” with the lights of the present day, to determine the\r\nprecise route taken by the Mexicans. (Hist, antig., tom. i. cap. 2.)\r\nLorenzana is not so modest. “Los Mexicanos por tradicion viniéron por\r\nel norte,” says he, “y se saben ciertamente sus mansiones.” (Hist. de\r\nNueva-España, p. 81, nota.)

Hardy, for\r\na population of 20,000 or 30,000 souls. The country for leagues is\r\ncovered with these remains, as well as with utensils of earthenware,\r\nobsidian, and other relics. A drawing which the author has given of a\r\npainted jar or vase may remind one of the Etruscan. “There were, also,\r\ngood specimens of earthen images in the Egyptian style,” he observes,\r\n“which are, _to me at least, so perfectly uninteresting_ that I was at\r\nno pains to procure any of them.” (Travels in the Interior of Mexico\r\n(London, 1829), pp. 464-466.) The lieutenant was neither a Boturini nor\r\na Belzoni.\r\n\r\n[417] Vater has examined the languages of three of these nations,\r\nbetween 50° and 60° north, and collated their vocabularies with the\r\nMexican, showing the probability of a common origin of many of the\r\nwords in each. Mithridates, Theil iii. Abtheil. 3, p. 212.\r\n\r\n[418] The Mexicans are noticed by M. de Humboldt as distinguished from\r\nthe other aborigines whom he had seen, by the quantity both of beard\r\nand moustaches. (Essai politique, tom. i. p. 361.) The modern Mexican,\r\nhowever, broken in spirit and fortunes, bears as little resemblance,\r\nprobably, in physical as in moral characteristics to his ancestors, the\r\nfierce and independent Aztecs.\r\n\r\n[419] Prichard, Physical History, vol. i. pp. 167-169, 182, et\r\nseq.--Morton, Crania Americana, p. 66.--McCulloh, Researches, p.\r\n18.--Lawrence, Lectures, pp. 317, 565.\r\n\r\n[420] Thus we find, amidst the generally prevalent copper or cinnamon\r\ntint, nearly all gradations of color, from the European white, to a\r\nblack, almost African; while the complexion capriciously varies among\r\ndifferent tribes in the neighborhood of each other. See examples\r\nin Humboldt (Essai politique, tom. i. pp. 358, 359), also Prichard\r\n(Physical History, vol. ii. pp. 452, 522, et alibi), a writer whose\r\nvarious research and dispassionate judgment have made his work a\r\ntext-book in this department of science.\r\n\r\n[421] Such is the conclusion of Dr. Warren, whose excellent collection\r\nhas afforded him ample means for study and comparison. (See his Remarks\r\nbefore the British Association for the Advancement of Science, ap.\r\nLondon Athenæum, Oct., 1837.) In the specimens collected by Dr. Morton,\r\nhowever, the barbarous tribes would seem to have a somewhat larger\r\nfacial angle, and a greater quantity of brain, than the semi-civilized.\r\nCrania Americana, p. 259.\r\n\r\n[422] “On ne peut se refuser d’admettre que l’espèce humaine n’offre\r\npas de races plus voisines que le sont celles des Américaines, des\r\nMongols, des Mantchoux, et des Malais.” Humboldt, Essai politique, tom.\r\ni. p. 367.--Also, Prichard, Physical History, vol. i. pp. 184-186; vol.\r\nii. pp. 365-367.--Lawrence, Lectures, p. 365.\r\n\r\n[423] Dr. Morton’s splendid work on American crania has gone far to\r\nsupply the requisite information. Out of about one hundred and fifty\r\nspecimens of skulls, of which he has ascertained the dimensions\r\nwith admirable precision, one-third belong to the semi-civilized\r\nraces; and of them thirteen are Mexican. The number of these last\r\nis too small to found any general conclusions upon, considering the\r\ngreat diversity found in individuals of the same nation, not to say\r\nkindred.--Blumenbach’s observations on American skulls were chiefly\r\nmade, according to Prichard (Physical History, vol. i. pp. 183, 184),\r\nfrom specimens of the Carib tribes, as unfavorable, perhaps, as any on\r\nthe continent.\r\n\r\n[424] Yet these specimens are not so easy to be obtained. With uncommon\r\nadvantages for procuring these myself in Mexico, I have not succeeded\r\nin obtaining any specimens of the genuine Aztec skull. The difficulty\r\nof this may be readily comprehended by any one who considers the length\r\nof time that has elapsed since the Conquest, and that the burial-places\r\nof the ancient Mexicans have continued to be used by their descendants.\r\nDr. Morton more than once refers to his specimens as those of the\r\n“genuine Toltec skull, from cemeteries in Mexico, older than the\r\nConquest.” (Crania Americana, pp. 152, 155, 231, et alibi.) But how\r\ndoes he know that the heads are Toltec? That nation is reported to\r\nhave left the country about the middle of the eleventh century, nearly\r\neight hundred years ago,--according to Ixtlilxochitl, indeed, a century\r\nearlier; and it seems much more probable that the specimens now found\r\nin these burial-places should belong to some of the races who have\r\nsince occupied the country, than to one so far removed. The presumption\r\nis manifestly too feeble to authorize any positive inference.\r\n\r\n[425] The tower of Belus, with its retreating stories, described by\r\nHerodotus (Clio, sec. 181), has been selected as the model of the\r\n_teocalli_; which leads Vater somewhat shrewdly to remark that it is\r\nstrange no evidence of this should appear in the erection of similar\r\nstructures by the Aztecs in the whole course of their journey to\r\nAnahuac. (Mithridates, Theil. iii. Abtheil. 3, pp. 74, 75.) The learned\r\nNiebuhr finds the elements of the Mexican temple in the mythic tomb of\r\nPorsenna. (Roman History, Eng. trans. (London, 1827), vol. i. p. 88.)\r\nThe resemblance to the accumulated pyramids composing this monument is\r\nnot very obvious. Com. Pliny (Hist. Nat., lib. 36, sec. 19). Indeed,\r\nthe antiquarian may be thought to encroach on the poet’s province when\r\nhe finds in Etruscan _fable_--“cum omnia excedat fabulositas,” as Pliny\r\ncharacterizes this--the origin of Aztec science.\r\n\r\n[426] See the powerful description of Lucan, Pharsalia, lib. 9,\r\nv. 966.--The Latin bard has been surpassed by the Italian, in the\r\nbeautiful stanza beginning _Giace l’ alta Cartago_ (Gerusalemme\r\nLiberata, c. 15, s. 20), which may be said to have been expanded by\r\nLord Byron into a canto,--the fourth of Childe Harold.\r\n\r\n[427] The most remarkable remains on the proper Mexican soil are the\r\ntemple or fortress of Xochicalco, not many miles from the capital. It\r\nstands on a rocky eminence, nearly a league in circumference, cut into\r\nterraces faced with stone. The building on the summit is seventy-five\r\nfeet long and sixty-six broad. It is of hewn granite, put together\r\nwithout cement, but with great exactness. It was constructed in the\r\nusual pyramidal, terraced form, rising by a succession of stories, each\r\nsmaller than that below it. The number of these is now uncertain; the\r\nlower one alone remaining entire. This is sufficient, however, to show\r\nthe nice style of execution, from the sharp, salient cornices, and the\r\nhieroglyphical emblems with which it is covered, all cut in the hard\r\nstone. As the detached blocks found among the ruins are sculptured with\r\nbas-reliefs in like manner, it is probable that the whole building\r\nwas covered with them. It seems probable, also, as the same pattern\r\nextends over different stones, that the work was executed after the\r\nwalls were raised.--In the hill beneath, subterraneous galleries, six\r\nfeet wide and high, have been cut to the length of one hundred and\r\neighty feet, where they terminate in two halls, the vaulted ceilings\r\nof which connect by a sort of tunnel with the buildings above. These\r\nsubterraneous works are also lined with hewn stone. The size of the\r\nblocks, and the hard quality of the granite of which they consist, have\r\nmade the buildings of Xochicalco a choice quarry for the proprietors of\r\na neighboring sugar-refinery, who have appropriated the upper stories\r\nof the temple to this ignoble purpose! The Barberini at least built\r\npalaces, beautiful themselves, as works of art, with the plunder of the\r\nColiseum. See the full description of this remarkable building, both by\r\nDupaix and Alzate. (Antiquités Mexicaines, tom. i. Exp. 1, pp. 15-20;\r\ntom. iii. Exp. 1, Pl. 33.) A recent investigation has been made by\r\norder of the Mexican government, the report of which differs, in some\r\nof its details, from the preceding. Revista Mexicana, tom. i. mem. 5.\r\n\r\n[428] _Ante_, pp. 196-199.\r\n\r\n[429] It is impossible to look at Waldeck’s finished drawings of\r\nbuildings, where Time seems scarcely to have set his mark on the\r\nnicely chiselled stone, and the clear tints are hardly defaced by a\r\nweather-stain, without regarding the artist’s work as a _restoration_;\r\na picture true, it may be, of those buildings in the day of their\r\nglory, but not of their decay.--Cogolludo, who saw them in the middle\r\nof the seventeenth century, speaks of them with admiration, as works of\r\n“accomplished architects,” of whom history has preserved no tradition.\r\nHistoria de Yucatan (Madrid, 1688), lib. 4, cap. 2.{*}\r\n\r\n{*} [The age of these ancient cities is still an unsolved problem, but\r\nthe conviction seems to be growing that many of them were inhabited at\r\nthe time of the Conquest. The sacred edifices at Uxmal did not cease\r\nto be used until some time after the Spaniards had become lords of\r\nthe land. Charnay (Ancient Cities of the New World, p. 328) thinks\r\nChichen Itza was inhabited “scarcely sixty years before the Conquest.”\r\nBandelier (Peabody Museum Report, ii. 126) says of the Tablet of the\r\nCross at Palenque, “These tablets and figures show in dress such a\r\nstriking analogy of what we know of the military accoutrements of the\r\nMexicans, that it is a strong approach to identity.” Bancroft (Native\r\nRaces, vol. iv.) specifies the literature dealing with Palenque.

But after a time these animal representations were\r\nshown to have existed only in the artist’s brain.--M.]\r\n\r\n[430] In the original text is a description of some of these ruins,\r\nespecially of those of Mitla and Palenque. It would have had novelty\r\nat the time in which it was written, since the only accounts of these\r\nbuildings were in the colossal publications of Lord Kingsborough, and\r\nin the Antiquités Mexicaines, not very accessible to most readers.

Indeed, many of the edifices, as well as statues, of\r\nancient Greece, also, still exhibit traces of having been painted.\r\n\r\n[438] The various causes of the stationary condition of art in Egypt,\r\nfor so many ages, are clearly exposed by the Duke di Serradifalco, in\r\nhis _Antichità della Sicilia_ (Palermo, 1834, tom. ii. pp. 33, 34);\r\na work in which the author, while illustrating the antiquities of a\r\nlittle island, has thrown a flood of light on the arts and literary\r\nculture of ancient Greece.\r\n\r\n[439] “The ideal is not always the beautiful,” as Winckelmann truly\r\nsays, referring to the Egyptian figures. (Histoire de l’Art chez les\r\nAnciens, liv. 4, chap. 2, trad. Fr.) It is not impossible, however,\r\nthat the portraits mentioned in the text may be copies from life. Some\r\nof the rude tribes of America distorted their infants’ heads into\r\nforms quite as fantastic; and Garcilaso de la Vega speaks of a nation\r\ndiscovered by the Spaniards in Florida, with a formation apparently not\r\nunlike the Palenque: “_Tienen cabezas increiblemente largas, y ahusadas\r\npara arriba_, que las ponen así con artificio, atándoselas desde el\r\npunto, que nascen las criaturas, hasta que son de nueve ó diez años.”\r\nLa Florida (Madrid, 1723), p. 190.\r\n\r\n[440] For a notice of this remarkable codex, see _ante_, p. 119. There\r\nis, indeed, a resemblance, in the use of straight lines and dots,\r\nbetween the Palenque writing and the Dresden MS. Possibly these dots\r\ndenoted years, like the rounds in the Mexican system.\r\n\r\n[441] The hieroglyphics are arranged in perpendicular lines. The heads\r\nare uniformly turned towards the right, as in the Dresden MS.\r\n\r\n[442] “Les ruines,” says the enthusiastic chevalier Le Noir, “sans\r\nnom, à qui l’on a donné celui de _Palenque_, peuvent remonter comme\r\nles plus anciennes ruines du monde à trois mille ans. Ceci n’est point\r\nmon opinion seule; c’est celle de _tous_ les voyageurs qui ont vu les\r\nruines dont il s’agit, de _tous_ les archéologues qui en ont examiné\r\nles dessins ou lu les descriptions, enfin des historiens qui ont fait\r\ndes recherches, et qui n’ont rien trouvé dans les annales du monde\r\nqui fasse soupçonner l’époque de la fondation de tels monuments, dont\r\nl’origine se perd dans la nuit des temps.” (Antiquités Mexicaines, tom.\r\nii., Examen, p. 73.) Colonel Galindo, fired with the contemplation\r\nof the American ruins, pronounces this country the true cradle of\r\ncivilization, whence it passed over to China, and latterly to Europe,\r\nwhich, whatever “its foolish vanity” may pretend, has but just started\r\nin the march of improvement! See his Letter on Copan, ap. Trans, of Am.\r\nAnt. Soc., vol. ii.\r\n\r\n[443] From these sources of information, and especially from the\r\nnumber of the concentric rings in some old trees, and the incrustation\r\nof stalactites found on the ruins of Palenque, M. Waldeck computes\r\ntheir age at between two and three thousand years. (Voyage en Yucatan,\r\np. 78.) The criterion, as far as the trees are concerned, cannot\r\nbe relied on in an advanced stage of their growth; and as to the\r\nstalactite formations, they are obviously affected by too many casual\r\ncircumstances, to afford the basis of an accurate calculation.{*}\r\n\r\n{*} [Charnay (Ancient Cities of the New World, p. 260) shows the\r\nworthlessness of the argument from tree growth. He says, “In my\r\nfirst expedition to Palenque in 1859, I had the eastern side of the\r\npalace cleared of the dense vegetation to secure a good photograph.\r\nConsequently, the trees that have grown since cannot be more than\r\ntwenty-two years old; now one of the cuttings, measuring some two feet\r\nin diameter, had upwards of 230 concentric circles, that is, at the\r\nrate of one in a month, or even less.” Reasoning on the idea that a\r\nconcentric circle upon a tree represents a growth of one year, Waldeck\r\nhad calculated the age of the structures at 2000 years.--M.]\r\n\r\n[444] Waldeck, Voyage en Yucatan, ubi supra.\r\n\r\n[445] Antiquités Mexicaines, Examen, p. 76.--Hardly deep enough,\r\nhowever, to justify Captain Dupaix’s surmise of the antediluvian\r\nexistence of these buildings; especially considering that the\r\naccumulation was in the sheltered position of an interior court.\r\n\r\n[446] [Ober, Travels in Mexico, p. 76.

He cites the following emphatic notice of\r\nthese remains from Las Casas: “Ciertamente la tierra de Yucathan da á\r\nentender cosas mui especiales, y de mayor antiguedad, por las grandes,\r\nadmirables, y excessivas maneras de edificios, y letreros de ciertos\r\ncaracteres, que en otra ninguna parte se hallan.” (Loc. cit.) Even\r\nthe inquisitive Martyr has collected no particulars respecting them,\r\nmerely noticing the buildings of this region with general expressions\r\nof admiration. (De Insulis nuper Inventis, pp. 334-340.) What is quite\r\nas surprising is the silence of Cortés, who traversed the country\r\nforming the base of Yucatan, in his famous expedition to Honduras, of\r\nwhich he has given many details we would gladly have exchanged for a\r\nword respecting these interesting memorials. Carta Quinta de Cortés,\r\nMS.--I must add that some remarks in the above paragraph in the text\r\nwould have been omitted, had I enjoyed the benefit of Mr. Stephens’s\r\nresearches when it was originally written.

Gomara speaks of a nation, dwelling about 40°\r\nnorth latitude, on the northwestern borders of New Spain, whose chief\r\nwealth was in droves of these cattle (_buyes con una giba sobre la\r\ncruz_, “oxen with a hump on the shoulders”), from which they got their\r\nclothing, food, and drink, which last, however, appears to have been\r\nonly the blood of the animal.

The Columbia plains,\r\nsays Gallatin, were as naked of game as of trees. (Synopsis, sec.\r\n5.) That the bison was sometimes found also on the other side of the\r\nmountains, is plain from Gomara’s statement. (Hist. de las Ind., loc.\r\ncit.)

(Ancient Egyptians, vol.\r\niii. pp. 241-246.) The origin of the most useful arts is lost in\r\ndarkness. Their very utility is one cause of this, from the rapidity\r\nwith which they are diffused among distant nations. Another cause is,\r\nthat in the first ages of the discovery men are more occupied with\r\navailing themselves of it than with recording its history; until time\r\nturns history into fiction. Instances are familiar to every school-boy.\r\n\r\n[458] [And in this connection also the reader may do well to consider\r\nthese words of the distinguished Americanist, D. G. Brinton, uttered\r\nin the International Congress of Anthropology in 1893: “Up to the\r\npresent time there has not been shown a single dialect, not an art or\r\nan institution, not a myth or a religious rite, not a domesticated\r\nplant or animal, not a tool, weapon, game, or symbol, in use in America\r\nat the time of the discovery, which had been previously imported from\r\nAsia, or from any other continent of the Old World.”--M.]\r\n\r\n[459] [The grandson of Ferdinand and Isabella was not Charles the\r\nFifth when the sceptre of Spain was thrust into his hands because his\r\nmother Joanna was unfit to rule. Charles called himself king when he\r\nmade his triumphal entry into Valladolid in 1517. But it was only with\r\nthe greatest difficulty that the Cortes of Castile was induced to\r\naccept him as titular sovereign _in conjunction with his mother_. Her\r\nname was to take precedence of his in all royal documents. Until her\r\ndeath in 1555, the year before her son’s abdication, Joanna was the\r\nrightful sovereign of Spain. Charles was elected emperor of the Holy\r\nRoman Empire in 1519, only two years after he had assumed the control\r\nof Spanish affairs. It is not remarkable, therefore, that he should be\r\nknown to most people only by the more important title. Charles was born\r\nin Ghent, February 24, 1500. His father was Philip the Fair, the heir\r\nof the German possessions of the house of Hapsburg, and the territories\r\nof the house of Burgundy. When the marriage of Philip and Joanna was\r\narranged no one dreamed that their son would succeed to the crown of\r\nSpain, for Joanna’s elder brother and elder sister were both alive.\r\nCharles scarcely knew his parents. When Isabella of Castile died his\r\nfather and mother went to Spain to take possession of the kingdom she\r\nhad left to her daughter. This was in 1506, and from that time until\r\n1517 Charles did not see his mother. His character was slow in forming.\r\nOnly in athletic sports did he early achieve success. In 1517 the Papal\r\nlegate Campeggi declared him more fit to be governed than to govern. He\r\nwas never a good scholar, and was a singularly bad linguist. French was\r\nthe language he first learned to speak. His native tongue, Flemish, he\r\ndid not begin to learn until he was thirteen. When he went to Spain he\r\nknew so little Spanish that one of the first demands made by the Cortes\r\nof Castile was that he should learn that language. He never thoroughly\r\nmastered German.--M.]\r\n\r\n[460] The following passage--one among many--from that faithful mirror\r\nof the times, Peter Martyr’s correspondence, does ample justice to the\r\nintemperance, avarice, and intolerable arrogance of the Flemings. The\r\ntestimony is worth the more, as coming from one who, though resident\r\nin Spain, was not a Spaniard. “Crumenas auro fulcire inhiant; huic uni\r\nstudio invigilant. Nec detrectat juvenis Rex. Farcit quacunque posse\r\ndatur; non satiat tamen. Quæ qualisve sit gens hæc, depingere adhuc\r\nnescio. Insufflat vulgus hic in omne genus hominum non arctoum. Minores\r\nfaciunt Hispanos, quam si nati essent inter eorum cloacas. Rugiunt jam\r\nHispani, labra mordent, submurmurant taciti, fatorum vices tales esse\r\nconqueruntur, quod ipsi domitores regnorum ita floccifiant ab his,\r\nquorum Deus unicus (sub rege temperato) Bacchus est cum Citherea.” Opus\r\nEpistolarum (Amstelodami, 1610), ep. 608.\r\n\r\n[461] Yet the nobles were not all backward in manifesting their\r\ndisgust. When Charles would have conferred the famous Burgundian order\r\nof the Golden Fleece on the Count of Benavente, that lord refused it,\r\nproudly telling him, “I am a Castilian. I desire no honors but those\r\nof my own country, in my opinion quite as good as--indeed, better\r\nthan--those of any other.” Sandoval, Historia de la Vida y Hechos del\r\nEmperador Cárlos V. (Ambéres, 1681), tom. i. p. 103.\r\n\r\n[462] [The tone of the preceding paragraphs is that of the Spanish\r\nchroniclers of the seventeenth century, and shows how the author,\r\ndespite his natural candor and impartiality of mind, had acquired\r\ninsensibly the habit of considering questions that affected Spain\r\nfrom the national point of view of the class of writers with whom\r\nhis studies had made him most familiar. Spain is called the “native\r\ncountry” of Charles V., and the “land of his fathers,” although,\r\nas hardly any reader will need to be reminded, he was born in the\r\nNetherlands and was of Spanish descent only on the maternal side. The\r\nterm “foreigner” is applied to him as if it indicated some vicious\r\ntrait in his nature; and the training which he had received as the heir\r\nto the Austro-Burgundian dominions is spoken of as erroneous, merely\r\nbecause it had not fitted him for a different position. His manners\r\nare contrasted with those of native Spanish sovereigns, as if wanting\r\nin graciousness and affability; yet the Spaniards, who alone ever made\r\nthis complaint, recognized their own ideal of royal demeanor in that\r\nof the taciturn and phlegmatic Philip II. In like manner, Charles is\r\nsupposed to have made his first acquaintance with free institutions on\r\nhis arrival in Spain; whereas he had been brought up in a country where\r\nthe power of the sovereign was perhaps more closely restricted by the\r\nchartered rights and immunities of the subject than was the case in any\r\nother part of Europe. That the union of Spain and the Netherlands was\r\na most incongruous one, disastrous to the freedom, the independence,\r\nand the development of both countries, is undeniable; but it was\r\nnot Charles’s early partiality for the one, but his successor’s far\r\nstronger partiality for the other, which rendered the incompatibility\r\napparent and led to a rupture of the connection.--K.]\r\n\r\n[463] I will take the liberty to refer the reader who is desirous of\r\nbeing more minutely acquainted with the Spanish colonial administration\r\nand the state of discovery previous to Charles V., to the “History of\r\nthe Reign of Ferdinand and Isabella” (Part 2, ch. 9, 26), where the\r\nsubject is treated _in extenso_.{*}\r\n\r\n{*} [All the documents relative to the commission sent out by Ximenes,\r\nincluding many reports from the commissioners, have been printed\r\nin the Col. de Doc. inéd. relativos al Descubrimiento, Conquista y\r\nColonizacion de las Posesiones españolas en América y Oceanía, tom.\r\ni.--K.]\r\n\r\n[464] See the curious document attesting this, and drawn up by order of\r\nColumbus, ap.

It is, in fact, only the\r\ninstructions given by this latter to his officer, who was no party to\r\nit.\r\n\r\n[513] Declaracion de Puertocarrero, MS.--Gomara, Crónica, cap.\r\n7.--Velasquez soon after obtained from the crown authority to colonize\r\nthe new countries, with the title of _adelantado_ over them. The\r\ninstrument was dated at Barcelona, Nov. 13th, 1518. (Herrera, Hist.\r\ngeneral, dec. 2, lib. 3, cap. 8.) Empty privileges! Las Casas gives a\r\ncaustic etymology of the title of _adelantado_, so often granted to the\r\nSpanish discoverers. “Adelantados porque se adelantaran en hazer males\r\ny daños tan gravísimos á gentes pacíficas.” Hist. de las Indias, MS.,\r\nlib. 3, cap. 117.\r\n\r\n[514] “Deterrebat,” says the anonymous biographer, “eum Cortesii natura\r\nimperii avida, fiducia sui ingens, et nimius sumptus in classe parandâ.\r\nTimere itaque Velasquius cœpit, si Cortesius cum eâ classe iret, nihil\r\nad se vel honoris vel lucri rediturum.” De Rebus gestis, MS.--Bernal\r\nDiaz, Hist. de la Conquista, cap. 19.--Las Casas, Hist. de las Indias,\r\nMS., cap. 114.\r\n\r\n[515] “Cortés no avia menester mas para entendello de mirar el gesto á\r\nDiego Velasquez segun su astuta viveza y mundana sabiduría.” Hist. de\r\nlas Indias, MS., cap. 114.\r\n\r\n[516] Las Casas had the story from Cortés’ own mouth.

(Conquista, lib. 1, cap. 10.) But it\r\nis not necessary to suppose that Cortés intended a rupture with his\r\nemployer by this clandestine movement, but only to secure himself in\r\nthe command. At all events, the text conforms in every particular to\r\nthe statement of Las Casas, who, as he knew both the parties well, and\r\nresided on the island at the time, had ample means of information.{*}\r\n\r\n{*} [Las Casas was not residing in Cuba, as Prescott supposes, when\r\nCortés sailed. The weight of authority seems to indicate that the\r\ndeparture of Cortés was hasty but not clandestine.

His possessions\r\nincluded a ship, a mare, a negro, and some cazabi bread and bacon.\r\nBernal Diaz very properly gives a list of the horses belonging to the\r\nexpedition, remarking that neither horses nor negroes could be had\r\nwithout great expense.

Bancroft also will have it that the standard of Cortés\r\nwas made of “taffeta,” not _velvet_.--M.]\r\n\r\n[521] Las Casas had this, also, from the lips of Cortés in later life.\r\n“Todo esto me dixo el mismo Cortés, con otras cosas cerca dello despues\r\nde Marques; ... reindo y mofando é con estas formales palabras, _Á la\r\nmi fée andube por allí como un gentil cosario_.” Hist. de las Indias,\r\nMS., cap. 115.\r\n\r\n[522] De Rebus gestis, MS.--Gomara, Crónica, cap. 8.--Las Casas, Hist.\r\nde las Indias, MS., cap. 114, 115.\r\n\r\n[523] [But not across the island. There was no need for Cortés to sail\r\nround the westerly point of Cuba with his squadron. Havana, or San\r\nCristóbal de la Habana, was then upon the south side of the island. The\r\ntown where the Havana of to-day stands was not founded until 1519. Many\r\nwriters besides Prescott, knowing nothing of this fact, have fallen\r\ninto this same error. From Trinidad to the new Habana would have been\r\na long and difficult march for Alvarado and his party, and a long and\r\nunnecessary voyage for the fleet of Cortés.--M.]\r\n\r\n[524] Bernal Diaz, Hist. de la Conquista, cap. 24.--De Rebus gestis,\r\nMS.--Gomara, Crónica, cap. 8.--Las Casas, Hist. de las Indias, MS.,\r\ncap. 115.--The legend on the standard was, doubtless, suggested by that\r\non the _labarum_,--the sacred banner of Constantine.\r\n\r\n[525] The most minute notices of the person and habits of Cortés are\r\nto be gathered from the narrative of the old cavalier Bernal Diaz, who\r\nserved so long under him, and from Gomara, the general’s chaplain.

(Carta de Vera Cruz, MS.)\r\nVelasquez himself, in a communication to the Chief Judge of Hispaniola,\r\nstates the number at six hundred. (Carta de Diego Velasquez al Lic.\r\nFigueroa, MS.) I have adopted the estimates of Bernal Diaz, who, in his\r\nlong service, seems to have become intimately acquainted with every one\r\nof his comrades, their persons, and private history.\r\n\r\n[530] Incredibly dear indeed, since, from the statements contained in\r\nthe depositions at Villa Segura, it appears that the cost of the horses\r\nfor the expedition was from four to five hundred _pesos de oro_ each!\r\n“Si saben que de caballos que el dicho Señor Capitan General Hernando\r\nCortés ha comprado para servir en la dicha Conquista, que son diez é\r\nocho, que le han costado á quatrocientos cinquenta é á quinientos pesos\r\nha pagado, é que deve mas de ocho mil pesos de oro dellos.” (Probanza\r\nen Villa Segura, MS.) The estimation of these horses is sufficiently\r\nshown by the minute information Bernal Diaz has thought proper to\r\ngive of every one of them; minute enough for the pages of a sporting\r\ncalendar. See Hist. de la Conquista, cap. 23.\r\n\r\n[531] “Io vos propongo grandes premios, mas embueltos en grandes\r\ntrabajos; pero la virtud no quiere ociosidad.” (Gomara, Crónica, cap.\r\n9.) It is the thought so finely expressed by Thomson:\r\n\r\n    “For sluggard’s brow the laurel never grows;\r\n     Renown is not the child of indolent repose.”\r\n\r\n\r\n[532] The text is a very condensed abridgment of the original speech\r\nof Cortés,--or of his chaplain, as the case may be.

It seems to have been part of a\r\ngreat compilation “De Orbe Novo,” written, probably, on the plan of a\r\nseries of biographical sketches, as the introduction speaks of a life\r\nof Columbus preceding this of Cortés. It was composed, as it states,\r\nwhile many of the old Conquerors were still surviving, and is addressed\r\nto the son of Cortés. The historian, therefore, had ample means of\r\nverifying the truth of his own statements, although they too often\r\nbetray, in his partiality for his hero, the influence of the patronage\r\nunder which the work was produced. It runs into a prolixity of detail\r\nwhich, however tedious, has its uses in a contemporary document.\r\nUnluckily, only the first book was finished, or, at least, has\r\nsurvived; terminating with the events of this chapter. It is written in\r\nLatin, in a pure and perspicuous style, and is conjectured with some\r\nplausibility to be the work of Calvet de Estrella, Chronicler of the\r\nIndies.

This chronicle, from the pen of one who was almost\r\ncontemporary with the Conquest, corroborates the accounts given by the\r\nSpanish historians in most particulars. It refers to Chichen Itza and\r\nIzamal as inhabited when the Spaniards descended upon the country. It\r\nis sometimes inaccurate as to details, as in this reference to Aguilar:\r\n“Thus the land was discovered by Aguilar, who was eaten by Ah Naum\r\nAh Pat at Cuzamil in the year 1517.” We know, of course, that it was\r\nanother Spaniard who was eaten by Ah Naum Ah Pat.

In another place he\r\npronounces an animated invective against the iniquity of those who\r\ncovered up hostilities under this empty form of words, the import of\r\nwhich was utterly incomprehensible to the barbarians.

The famous formula, used by the Spanish Conquerors on this\r\noccasion, was drawn up by Dr. Palacios Reubios, a man of letters, and\r\na member of the King’s council. “But I laugh at him and his letters,”\r\nexclaims Oviedo, “if he thought a word of it could be comprehended by\r\nthe untutored Indians!” (Hist. de las Ind., MS., lib. 29, cap. 7.)

With his usual inquisitive spirit, he gleaned all the particulars\r\nfrom the old pilot Alaminos, and from two of the officers of Cortés\r\nwho revisited Spain in the course of that year. Tabasco was in the\r\nneighborhood of those ruined cities of Yucatan which have lately been\r\nthe theme of so much speculation.

His\r\nfaith in the same vision on subsequent occasions is expressed without\r\ndemur. In the present case he recognized the rider of the gray horse\r\nas a Spanish cavalier, Francisco de Morla. It appears from the account\r\nof Andrés de Tápia, another companion of Cortés, whose narrative has\r\nbeen recently published, that owing to canals and other impediments,\r\nthe cavalry was unable to effect the intended détour, and it therefore\r\nreturned and joined the infantry.

The apostle first appeared as a leader of the Spanish hosts\r\nin the battle of Clavijo, 846. He rode upon a white charger, and\r\ncarried in his left hand a snow-white banner. In his right hand was\r\na flashing sword. Because of his wondrous aid sixty thousand Moslems\r\nwere vanquished that day by the soldiers of King Ramiro. Mariana, Book\r\nvii, chap, xiii, tells the story, and many writers accepted the legend.\r\nUnfortunately, however, careful investigation has shown that the battle\r\nitself was apocryphal.\r\n\r\nIn the tenth century he appeared again when Ramiro II defeated the\r\ngreat Abderahman, and as a result pilgrims innumerable flocked to the\r\nshrine of Santiago de Compostella.\r\n\r\nAgain his white horse led the Spanish cavalry when Fernando was\r\nbesieging Coimbra in 1058, or thereabout, as one may read in Southey’s\r\nChronicle of the Cid.\r\n\r\nAt Xeres, in 1237, Alfonso of Castile, with fifteen hundred men,\r\ndefeated a force seven times larger than his own because all men saw\r\nplainly the glorious vision.

Chich., MS., cap. 79.--Clavigero, Stor.\r\ndel Messico, tom. iii. p. 16.--New Vera Cruz, as the present town is\r\ncalled, is distinct, as we shall see hereafter, from that established\r\nby Cortés, and was not founded till the close of the sixteenth century,\r\nby the Conde de Monterey, Viceroy of Mexico. It received its privileges\r\nas a city from Philip III. in 1615. Ibid., tom. iii. p. 30, nota.\r\n\r\n[565] The epidemic of the _matlazahuatl_, so fatal to the Aztecs,\r\nis shown by M. de Humboldt to have been essentially different from\r\nthe _vómito_, or bilious fever of our day. Indeed, this disease is\r\nnot noticed by the early conquerors and colonists, and, Clavigero\r\nasserts, was not known in Mexico till 1725. (Stor. del Messico, tom.\r\ni. p. 117, nota.) Humboldt, however, arguing that the same physical\r\ncauses must have produced similar results, carries the disease back\r\nto a much higher antiquity, of which he discerns some traditional and\r\nhistoric vestiges. “Il ne faut pas confondre l’epoque,” he remarks,\r\nwith his usual penetration, “à laquelle une maladie a été décrite\r\npour la première fois, parce qu’elle a fait de grands ravages dans un\r\ncourt espace de temps, avec l’époque de sa première apparition.” Essai\r\npolitique, tom. iv. p. 161 et seq., and 179.\r\n\r\n[566] Gomara, Crónica, cap. 26.\r\n\r\n[567] Las Casas, Hist. de las Indias, MS., lib. 3, cap. 119.\r\n\r\n[568] [According to a curious document published by Icazbalceta (Col.\r\nde Doc. para la Hist. de México, tom. ii.), two of the principal\r\ncaciques present on this occasion communicated secretly with Cortés,\r\nand, declaring themselves disaffected subjects of Montezuma, offered\r\nto facilitate the advance of the Spaniards by furnishing the general\r\nwith paintings in which the various features of the country would\r\nbe correctly delineated. The offer was accepted, and on the next\r\nvisit the paintings were produced, and proved subsequently of great\r\nservice to Cortés, who rewarded the donors with certain grants. But\r\nthe genuineness of this paper, though supported by so distinguished a\r\nscholar as Señor Ramirez, is more than questionable.--K.]\r\n\r\n[569] Ixtlilxochitl, Relaciones, MS., No. 13.--Idem, Hist.
