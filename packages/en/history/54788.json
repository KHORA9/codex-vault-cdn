My brother answered that he had\r\nforwarded my letter to my mother. Madame de Chateaubriand did not keep\r\nme waiting: she enabled me to clear my debt and to leave the Havre.\r\nShe told me that Lucile was with her, also my uncle de Bedée and his\r\nfamily. This intelligence persuaded me to go to Saint-Malo, so that I\r\nmight consult my uncle on the question of my proposed emigration.\r\n\r\nRevolutions are like rivers: they grow wider in their course; I found\r\nthat which I had left in France enormously swollen and overflowing its\r\nbanks: I had left it with Mirabeau under the \"Constituent,\" I found it\r\nwith Danton[2] under the \"Legislative[3]\" Assembly.\r\n\r\nThe Treaty of Pilnitz, of the 27th of August 1791, had become known in\r\nParis. On the 14th of December 1791, while I was being tossed by the\r\nstorms, the King announced that he had written to the Princes of the\r\nGermanic Body, and in particular to the Elector of Trèves, touching\r\nthe German armaments. The brothers of Louis XVI., the Prince de Condé,\r\nM. de Calonne, the Vicomte de Mirabeau, and M. de Laqueville[4] were\r\nalmost immediately impeached. As early as the 9th of November, a\r\nprevious decree had been hurled against the other Emigrants: it was to\r\nenter these ranks, already proscribed, that I was hastening; others\r\nmight perhaps have retreated, but the threats of the stronger have\r\nalways made me take the side of the weaker: the pride of victory is\r\nunendurable to me.\r\n\r\nOn my way from the Havre to Saint-Malo I was able to observe the\r\ndivisions and misfortunes of France: the country-seats were burnt\r\nand abandoned; the owners, to whom distaffs had been sent, had left;\r\nthe women were living sheltered in the towns. The hamlets and small\r\nmarket-towns groaned under the tyranny of clubs affiliated to the\r\ncentral Club des Cordeliers, since amalgamated with the Jacobins. The\r\nantagonist of the latter, the Société Monarchique, or des Feuillants,\r\nno longer existed; the vulgar nickname of _sans-culotte_ had become\r\npopular; the King was never spoken of save as \"Monsieur Veto\" or\r\n\"Monsieur Capet.\"\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: My marriage.]\r\n\r\nI was tenderly welcomed by my mother and my family, although they\r\ndeplored the inopportune moment which I had selected for my return.\r\nMy uncle, the Comte de Bedée, was preparing to go to Jersey with his\r\nwife, his son, and his daughters. It was a question of finding money to\r\nenable me to join the Princes. My American journey had made a breach\r\nin my fortune; my property was reduced to almost nothing, where my\r\nyounger son's portion was concerned, through the suppression of the\r\nfeudal rights; and the benefices that were to accrue to me by virtue of\r\nmy affiliation to the Order of Malta had fallen, with the remainder of\r\nthe goods of the clergy, into the hands of the nation. This conjuncture\r\nof circumstances decided the most serious step in my life: my family\r\nmarried me in order to procure me the means of going to get killed in\r\nsupport of a cause which I did not love.\r\n\r\nThere was living in retirement, at Saint-Malo, M. de Lavigne[5], a\r\nknight of Saint-Louis, and formerly Commandant of Lorient. The Comte\r\nd'Artois had stayed with him there when he visited Brittany: the Prince\r\nwas charmed with his host, and promised to grant him any favour he\r\nmight at any time demand. M. de Lavigne had two sons: one of them[6]\r\nmarried Mademoiselle de La Placelière. Two daughters, born of this\r\nmarriage, were left orphans on both sides at a tender age. The elder\r\nmarried the Comte du Plessix-Parscau[7], a captain in the Navy, the\r\nson and grandson of admirals, himself to-day a rear-admiral, a red\r\nribbon[8] and commander of the corps of naval cadets at Brest; the\r\nyounger[9] was living with her grandfather, and was seventeen years of\r\nage when I arrived at Saint-Malo on my return from America. She was\r\nwhite, delicate, slender and very pretty: she wore her beautiful fair\r\nhair, which curled naturally, hanging low like a child's. Her fortune\r\nwas valued at five or six hundred thousand francs.\r\n\r\nMy sisters took it into their heads to make me marry Mademoiselle de\r\nLavigne, who had become greatly attached to Lucile. The affair was\r\nmanaged without my knowledge. I had seen Mademoiselle de Lavigne three\r\nor four times at most; I recognised her at a distance on the \"Furrow\"\r\nby her pink pelisse, her white gown and her fair hair blown out by\r\nthe wind, when I was on the beach abandoning myself to the caresses\r\nof my old mistress, the sea. I felt myself to possess none of the\r\ngood qualities of a husband. All my illusions were alive, nothing was\r\nspent within me; the very energy of my existence had doubled through\r\nmy travels. I was racked by the muse. Lucile liked Mademoiselle de\r\nLavigne, and saw the independence of my fortune in this marriage:\r\n\r\n\"Have your way!\" said I.\r\n\r\nIn me the public man is inflexible; the private man is at the mercy of\r\nwhomsoever wishes to seize hold of him, and, to save myself an hour's\r\nwrangling, I would become a slave for a century.\r\n\r\nThe consent of the grandfather, the paternal uncle and the principal\r\nrelatives was easily obtained: there remained to be overcome the\r\nobjections of a maternal uncle, M. de Vauvert[10], a great democrat,\r\nwho opposed the marriage of his niece with an aristocrat like myself,\r\nwho was not one at all. We thought ourselves able to do without him,\r\nbut my pious mother insisted that the religious marriage should be\r\nperformed by a \"non-juror\" priest, which could only be done in secret.\r\nM. de Vauvert knew this, and let loose the law upon us, under pretext\r\nof rape and breach of the laws, and pleading the imaginary state of\r\nsecond childhood into which the grandfather, M. de Lavigne, had fallen.\r\nMademoiselle de Lavigne, who had become Madame de Chateaubriand,\r\nwithout my having held any communication with her, was taken away in\r\nthe name of the law and put into the Convent of Victory at Saint-Malo,\r\npending the decision of the courts.\r\n\r\nThere was no rape, breach of the laws, adventure, nor love in the\r\nwhole matter; the wedding had only the bad side of a novel: truth.\r\nThe case was tried and the court pronounced the marriage civilly\r\nvalid. The members of both families being in agreement, M. de Vauvert\r\nabandoned the proceedings. The constitutional clergyman, lavishly\r\nfeed, withdrew his protest against the first nuptial benediction, and\r\nMadame de Chateaubriand was released from the convent, where Lucile had\r\nimprisoned herself with her.\r\n\r\nIt was a new acquaintance that I had to make, and it brought me all\r\nthat I could wish. I doubt whether a finer intelligence than my wife's\r\nhas ever existed: she guesses the thought and the word about to spring\r\nto the brow or the lips of the person with whom she converses; to\r\ndeceive her is impossible. Madame de Chateaubriand has an original and\r\ncultured mind, writes most cleverly, tells a story to perfection, and\r\nadmires me without ever having read two lines of my works: she would\r\ndread to find ideas in them that differ from hers, or to discover that\r\npeople are not sufficiently enthusiastic over my merit. Although a\r\npassionate judge, she is well-informed and a good judge.\r\n\r\nMadame de Chateaubriand's defects, if she have any, proceed from the\r\nsuperabundance of her good qualities; my own very serious defects\r\nresult from the sterility of mine. It is easy to possess resignation,\r\npatience, a general obligingness, equanimity of temper, when one\r\ninterests himself in nothing, when one is wearied by everything,\r\nwhen one replies to good and bad fortune alike with a desperate and\r\ndespairing \"What does it matter?\"\r\n\r\nMadame de Chateaubriand is better than I, although less accessible in\r\nher intercourse with others. Have I been irreproachable in my relations\r\nwith her? Have I offered my companion all the sentiments which she\r\ndeserved and which were hers by right? Has she ever complained? What\r\nhappiness has she tasted in reward for her consistent affection? She\r\nhas shared my adversities; she has been plunged into the prisons of\r\nthe Terror, the persecutions of the Empire, the disgraces of the\r\nRestoration; she has not known the joys of maternity to counterbalance\r\nher sufferings. Deprived of children, which she might perhaps have had\r\nin another union, and which she would have loved madly; having none of\r\nthe honours and affections which surround the mother of a family and\r\nconsole a woman for the loss of her prime, she has travelled, sterile\r\nand solitary, towards old age. Often separated from me, disliking\r\nliterature, to her the pride of bearing my name makes no amends. Timid\r\nand trembling for me alone, she is deprived, through her ever-renewed\r\nanxiety, of sleep and of the time to cure her ills: I am her chronic\r\ninfirmity and the cause of her relapses. Can I compare an occasional\r\nimpatience which she has shown me with the cares which I have caused\r\nher? Can I set my good qualities, such as they are, against her\r\nvirtues, which support the poor, which have established the Infirmerie\r\nde Marie-Thérèse in the face of all obstacles? What are my labours\r\nbeside the works of that Christian woman? When the two of us appear\r\nbefore God, it is I who shall be condemned.\r\n\r\nUpon the whole, when I consider my nature with all its imperfections,\r\nis it certain that marriage has spoilt my destiny?\r\n\r\nI should no doubt have had more leisure and repose; I should have been\r\nbetter received in certain circles and by certain of the great ones of\r\nthis earth; yet in politics, though Madame de Chateaubriand may have\r\ncrossed me, she never checked me, for here, as in matters affecting\r\nmy honour, I judge only by my own feeling. Should I have produced a\r\ngreater number of works if I had remained independent, and would those\r\nworks have been any better? Have there not been circumstances, as shall\r\nbe seen, in which, by marrying outside France, I should have ceased\r\nto write and disowned my country? If I had not married, would not my\r\nweakness have made me the prey of some worthless creature? Should not\r\nI have squandered and polluted my days like Lord Byron[11]? To-day,\r\nwhen I am sinking into old age, all my wildness would have passed;\r\nnothing would remain to me but emptiness and regrets: I should be an\r\nold bachelor, unesteemed, either deceived or undeceived, an old bird\r\nrepeating my worn-out song to whosoever refused to listen to it. The\r\nfull indulgence of my desires would not have added one string more\r\nto my lyre, nor one more earnest note to my voice. The constraint of\r\nmy feelings, the mystery of my thoughts have perhaps increased the\r\nforcefulness of my accents, quickened my works with an internal fever,\r\nwith a hidden flame, which would have spent itself in the free air\r\nof love. Held back by an indissoluble tie, I purchased at first, at\r\nthe cost of a little bitterness, the sweets which I taste to-day. Of\r\nthe ills of my existence I have preserved only the incurable part. I\r\ntherefore owe an affectionate and eternal gratitude to my wife, whose\r\nattachment has been as touching as it has been profound and sincere.\r\nShe has rendered my life more grave, more noble, more honourable, by\r\nalways inspiring me with respect for duty, if not always with the\r\nstrength to perform it.\r\n\r\nI was married at the end of March 1792, and on the 20th of April the\r\nLegislative Assembly declared war against Francis II.[12], who had just\r\nsucceeded his father Leopold; on the 10th of the same month Benedict\r\nLabre[13] was beatified in Rome: there you have two different worlds.\r\nThe war hurried the remaining nobles out of France. Persecutions were\r\nbeing redoubled on the one hand; on the other, the Royalists were no\r\nlonger permitted to stay at home without being accounted as cowards: it\r\nwas time for me to make my way to the camp which I had come so far to\r\nseek. My uncle de Bedée and his family took ship for Jersey, and I set\r\nout for Paris with my wife and my sisters Lucile and Julie.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: We go to Paris.]\r\n\r\nWe had secured an apartment in the little Hôtel de Villette, in the\r\nCul-de-Sac Férou, Faubourg Saint-Germain. I hastened in search of\r\nmy first friends. I saw the men of letters with whom I had had some\r\nacquaintance. Among new faces I noticed those of the learned Abbé\r\nBarthélemy[14] and the poet Saint-Ange[15]. The abbé modelled the\r\n_gynecœa_ of Athens too closely upon the drawing-rooms at Chanteloup.\r\nThe translator of Ovid was not a man without talent; talent is a gift,\r\nan isolated thing: it can come together with other mental faculties,\r\nit can be separated from them. Saint-Ange supplied a proof of this; he\r\nmade the greatest efforts not to be stupid, but was unable to prevent\r\nhimself. A man whose pencil I admired and still admire, Bernardin de\r\nSaint-Pierre[16], was lacking in intelligence, and unfortunately his\r\ncharacter was on a level with his intelligence. How many pictures in\r\nthe _Études de la nature_ are spoilt by the writer's limited mind and\r\nwant of elevation of soul.\r\n\r\nRulhière had died suddenly, in 1791[17], before my departure for\r\nAmerica. I have since seen his little house at Saint-Denis, with the\r\nfountain and the pretty statue of Love, at the foot of which one reads\r\nthese verses:\r\n\r\n    D'Egmont avec l'Amour visita cette rive:\r\n      Une image de sa beauté\r\n    Se peignit un moment sur l'onde fugitive:\r\n    D'Egmont a disparu; l'Amour seul est resté[18].\r\n\r\nWhen I left France the theatres of Paris were still ringing with the\r\n_Réveil d'Épiménide_[19], and with this stanza:\r\n\r\n    J'aime la vertu guerrière\r\n      De nos braves défenseurs,\r\n    Mais d'un peuple sanguinaire\r\n      Je déteste les fureurs.\r\n    À l'Europe redoutables,\r\n      Soyons libres à jamais,\r\n    Mais soyons toujours aimables\r\n      Et gardons l'esprit français[20].\r\n\r\nWhen I returned, the _Réveil d'Épiménide_ had been forgotten; and, if\r\nthe stanza had been sung, the author would have been badly handled.\r\n_Charles IX._ was now the rage. The popularity of this piece depended\r\nprincipally upon the circumstances of the time: the tocsin, a nation\r\narmed with poniards, the hatred of the kings and the priests, all these\r\noffered a reproduction between four walls of the tragedy which was\r\nbeing publicly enacted. Talma, still at the commencement of his career,\r\nwas continuing his successes.\r\n\r\nWhile tragedy dyed the streets, the pastoral flourished on the stage;\r\nthere was question of little but innocent shepherds and virginal\r\nshepherdesses: fields, brooks, meadows, sheep, doves, the golden age\r\nbeneath the thatch, were revived to the sighing of the shepherd's\r\npipe before the cooing Tirces and the simple-minded knitting-women\r\nwho had but lately left that other spectacle of the guillotine. Had\r\nSanson had time, he would have played Colin to Mademoiselle Théroigne\r\nde Méricourt's[21] Babet. The Conventionals plumed themselves upon\r\nbeing the mildest of men: good fathers, good sons, good husbands, they\r\nwent out walking with the children, acted as their nurses, wept with\r\ntenderness at their simple games; they lifted these little lambs gently\r\nin their arms to show them the \"gee-gees\" of the carts carrying the\r\nvictims to execution. They sang the praises of nature, peace, pity,\r\nkindness, candour, the domestic virtues; these devout philanthropists,\r\nwith extreme sensibility, sent their neighbours to have their heads\r\nsliced off for the greater happiness of mankind.\r\n\r\n*\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Paris in 1792.]\r\n\r\nParis in 1792 no longer presented the outward aspect of 1789 and 1790:\r\none saw no longer the budding Revolution, but a people marching drunk\r\nto its destinies, across abysses and by uncertain roads. The appearance\r\nof the people was no longer tumultuous, curious, eager: it was\r\nthreatening. In the streets one met none but frightened or ferocious\r\nfigures, men creeping along the houses so as not to be seen, or others\r\nseeking their prey: timid and lowered eyes were turned away from you,\r\nor else harsh eyes were fixed on yours in order to sound and fathom you.\r\n\r\nAll diversity of costume had ceased; the old world kept in the\r\nbackground; men had donned the uniform cloak of the new world, a\r\ncloak which had become merely the last garment of the future victims.\r\nAlready the social license displayed at the rejuvenation of France,\r\nthe liberties of 1789, those fantastic and unruly liberties of a state\r\nof things which is engaged in self-destruction and which has not yet\r\nturned to anarchy were levelling themselves beneath the sceptre of the\r\npeople; one felt the approach of a plebeian tyranny, fruitful, it is\r\ntrue, and filled with expectations, but also formidable in a manner\r\nvery different from the decaying despotism of the old monarchy: for,\r\nthe sovereign people being ubiquitous, when it turns tyrant the tyrant\r\nis ubiquitous; it is the universal presence of an universal Tiberius.\r\n\r\nWith the Parisian population was mingled an exotic population of\r\ncut-throats from the south; the advance-guard of the Marseillese, whom\r\nDanton was bringing up for the day's work of the 10th of August and the\r\nmassacres of September, were recognisable by their rags, their bronzed\r\ncomplexions, their look of cowardice and crime, but of crime of another\r\nsun: _in vultu vitium._\r\n\r\nIn the Legislative Assembly there was no one whom I recognised;\r\nMirabeau and the early idols of our troubles either were no more or had\r\nbeen hurled from their altars. In order to put together the thread of\r\nhistory broken by my journey in America, I must trace matters a little\r\nfurther back.\r\n\r\n*\r\n\r\nThe flight of the King, on the 21st of June 1791, caused the Revolution\r\nto take an immense step forward. Brought back to Paris on the 25th\r\nof that month, he was then dethroned for the first time, since the\r\nNational Assembly declared that its decrees would have the force of\r\nlaw without there being any need of royal sanction or acceptance. A\r\nhigh court of justice, anticipating the revolutionary tribunal, was\r\nestablished at Orleans. Thenceforward Madame Roland[22] demanded the\r\nhead of the Queen, until such time as her own head should be demanded\r\nby the Revolution. The mob-gathering had taken place in the Champ de\r\nMars, to protest against the decree which suspended the King from his\r\nfunctions instead of putting him upon his trial. The acceptance of\r\nthe Constitution, on the 14th of September, had no calming effect.\r\nThere was a question of declaring the dethronement of Louis XVI.;\r\nhad this been done, the crime of the 21st of January would not have\r\nbeen committed; the position of the French people in relation to the\r\nmonarchy and in the eyes of posterity would have been different. The\r\nConstituents who opposed the dethronement thought they were saving the\r\nCrown, whereas they undid it; those who thought to undo it by demanding\r\nthe dethronement would have saved it. In politics the result is almost\r\ninvariably the opposite of what is foreseen.\r\n\r\nOn the 30th of that same month of September 1791, the Constituent\r\nAssembly held its last sitting; the imprudent decree of the 17th of May\r\nprevious, which prohibited the re-election of the retiring members,\r\ngave birth to the Convention. There is nothing more dangerous, more\r\ninadequate, more inapplicable to general affairs than resolutions\r\nappropriate to individuals or bodies of men, however honourable in\r\nthemselves.\r\n\r\nThe decree of the 29th of September for regulating popular societies\r\nserved only to make them more violent. This was the last act of the\r\nConstituent Assembly: it dissolved on the following day, bequeathing to\r\nFrance a revolution.\r\n\r\n*\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The Legislative Assembly.]\r\n\r\nThe Legislative Assembly, installed on the 1st of October 1791,\r\nrevolved within the whirlwind which was about to sweep away the living\r\nand the dead. Troubles stained the departments with blood; at Caen\r\nthe people were surfeited with massacres and ate the heart of M. de\r\nBelsunce[23].\r\n\r\nThe King set his veto to the decree against the Emigrants and to that\r\nwhich deprived the non-juror ecclesiastics of all emolument. These\r\nlawful acts increased the excitement. Pétion had become Mayor of\r\nParis[24]. The deputies preferred a bill of impeachment against the\r\nEmigrant Princes on the 1st of January 1792; on the 2nd, they fixed the\r\ncommencement of the Year IV. of Liberty on that same 1st of January.\r\nAbout the 13th of February, red caps were seen in the streets of Paris,\r\nand the municipality ordered pikes to be manufactured. The manifesto\r\nof the Emigrants appeared on the 1st of March. Austria armed. Paris\r\nwas divided into more or less hostile sections[25]. On the 20th of\r\nMarch 1792, the Legislative Assembly adopted the sepulchral piece of\r\nmechanism without which the sentences of the Terror could not have been\r\nexecuted; it was first tried on dead bodies, so that these might teach\r\nit its trade. One may speak of the instrument as of an executioner,\r\nsince persons who were touched by its good services presented it with\r\nsums of money for its support[26]. The invention of the murder-machine,\r\nat the very moment when it had become necessary to crime, is a\r\nnoteworthy proof of the intelligence of co-ordinate facts, or rather a\r\nproof of the hidden action of Providence when it proposes to change the\r\nface of empires.\r\n\r\nMinister Roland had been summoned to the King's Council at the\r\ninstigation of the Girondins[27]. On the 20th of April, war was\r\ndeclared against the King of Hungary and Bohemia[28]. Marat published\r\nthe _Ami du peuple_ in spite of the decree by which he was stricken.\r\nThe Royal German Regiment and the Berchiny Regiment deserted.\r\nIsnard[29] spoke of the perfidy of the Court, Gensonné[30] and\r\nBrissot[31] denounced the Austrian Committee. An insurrection broke\r\nout on the subject of the Royal Guard, which was disbanded[32]. On\r\nthe 28th of May, the Assembly declared its sittings permanent. On the\r\n20th of June, the Palace of the Tuileries was forced by the mob of\r\nthe Faubourgs Saint-Antoine and Saint-Marceau, the pretext being the\r\nrefusal of Louis XVI. to sanction the proscription of the priests; the\r\nKing was in peril of his life. The country was declared in danger.\r\nM. de La Fayette was burnt in effigy. The federates of the second\r\nFederation were arriving; the Marseilleise, called up by Danton, were\r\non the march: they entered Paris on the 30th of July and were billeted\r\nby Pétion at the Cordeliers.\r\n\r\n*\r\n\r\nBy the side of the national tribune, two competing tribunes had sprung\r\nup: that of the Jacobins and that of the Cordeliers, then the more\r\nformidable because it sent members to the famous Commune of Paris and\r\nsupplied it with means of action. If the formation of the Commune had\r\nnot taken place, Paris, for want of a point of concentration, would\r\nhave split up, and the various mayoralties become rival powers.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The Club of Cordeliers.]\r\n\r\nThe Club des Cordeliers had its abode in the monastery, whose church\r\nwas built in the reign of St Louis, in 1259[33], with funds paid as\r\ndamages for a murder: in 1590 it became the resort of the most famous\r\nLeaguers. Certain places seem to be the laboratories of factions:\r\n\"Intelligence was brought,\" says L'Estoile (12 July 1593), \"to the\r\nDuc de Mayenne[34] of two hundred Cordeliers newly arrived in Paris,\r\nsupplying themselves with arms and concerting with the Sixteen[35],\r\nwho held council daily at the Cordeliers of Paris.... On that day the\r\nSixteen, assembled at the Cordeliers, cast aside their arms.\"\r\n\r\nThe fanatics of the League had therefore handed down the monastery of\r\nthe Cordeliers to our philosophical revolutionaries as a dead-house.\r\n\r\nThe pictures, the carved and painted images, the veils, the curtains\r\nof the convent had been pulled down; the basilica, flayed of its\r\nskin, presented its bare skeleton to the eye. In the apsis of the\r\nchurch, where the wind and the rain entered through the broken panes\r\nof the rose-windows, some joiners' benches served as a table for the\r\npresident, when the sittings were held in the church. On these benches\r\nlay red caps, with which each speaker covered his head before ascending\r\nthe tribune. The latter consisted of four buttressed stop-planks,\r\ncrossed at their X by a single plank, like a scaffolding.\r\nBehind the president, together with a statue of Liberty, one saw\r\nso-called instruments of ancient justice, instruments whose place had\r\nbeen supplied by one other, the blood-machine, in the same way as\r\ncomplicated machinery has been replaced by the hydraulic ram. The Club\r\ndes Jacobins _épurés_, or purged Jacobin Club, borrowed some of these\r\narrangements of the Cordeliers.\r\n\r\n*\r\n\r\nThe orators, who had met for purposes of destruction, were unable to\r\nagree in electing their leaders or in the methods to be employed; they\r\ntreated each other as scoundrels, pickpockets, thieves, butchers, to\r\nthe cacophony of the hisses and groans of their several groups of\r\ndevils. Their metaphors were taken from the stock of murders, borrowed\r\nfrom the filthiest objects of every kind of sewer and dunghill, or\r\ndrawn from the places consecrated to the prostitution of men and\r\nwomen. Gestures accentuated these figures of speech; everything was\r\ncalled by its name, with cynical indecency, in an obscene and impious\r\npageantry of oaths and blasphemies. Destruction and production, death\r\nand generation, one distinguished naught else through the savage\r\nslang which deafened the ears. The speech-makers, with their shrill\r\nor thundering voices, had interrupters other than their opponents:\r\nthe little brown owls of the cloisters without monks and the steeple\r\nwithout bells played in the broken windows, in the hope of booty;\r\nthey interrupted the speeches. They were first called to order by the\r\njingling of the impotent bell; but when they failed to stop their\r\nclamour, shots were fired at them to compel them to silence: they fell,\r\nthrobbing, wounded and fatidical, in the midst of the pandemonium.\r\nBroken-down timber-work, rickety pews, ramshackle stalls, fragments\r\nof saints rolled and pushed against the walls, served as benches\r\nfor the dirty, grimy, drunken, sweating spectators, in their ragged\r\n_carmagnoles_, with their shouldered pikes or bare crossed arms.\r\n\r\nThe most deformed of the band obtained the readiest hearing. Mental\r\nand bodily infirmities have played a part in our troubles: wounded\r\nself-love has made great revolutionaries.\r\n\r\n*\r\n\r\nFollowing this precedence of hideousness, there appeared in succession,\r\nmingled with the ghosts of the Sixteen, a series of gorgon heads.\r\nThe former doctor of the Comte d'Artois' Bodyguards, the Swiss fœtus\r\nMarat[36], his bare feet in wooden clogs or hob-nailed shoes, was the\r\nfirst to hold forth, by virtue of his incontestable claims. Holding\r\nthe office of \"jester\" at the Court of the people, he exclaimed, with\r\nan insipid expression and the smirk of trite politeness which the old\r\nbringing-up set on every face:\r\n\r\n\"People, you must cut off two hundred and seventy thousand heads!\"\r\n\r\nTo this Caligula of the public places succeeded the atheistical\r\nshoemaker Chaumette[37]. He was followed by the \"Attorney-General\r\nto the Lantern,\" Camille Desmoulins, a stuttering Cicero, a public\r\ncounsellor of murders worn out with debauchery, a frivolous Republican\r\nwith his puns and jokes, a maker of graveyard jests, who said that, in\r\nthe massacres of September, \"all had passed off orderly.\" He consented\r\nto become a Spartan, provided the making of the black broth was left to\r\nMéot the tavern-keeper[38].\r\n\r\nFouché[39], who had hastened up from Juilly or Nantes, studied disaster\r\nunder those doctors: in the circle of wild beasts seated attentively\r\nround the chair he looked like a dressed-up hyena. He smelt the\r\neffluvium of the blood to come; already he inhaled the incense of the\r\nprocession of asses and executioners, pending the day on which, driven\r\nfrom the Club des Jacobins as a thief, an atheist and an assassin, he\r\nshould be chosen as a minister.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Marat.]\r\n\r\nWhen Marat had climbed down from his plank, that popular Triboulet[40]\r\nbecame the sport of his masters: they filliped him on the nose, trod\r\non his feet, hustled him with \"gee-ups,\" all of which did not prevent\r\nhim from becoming the leader of the multitude, climbing to the clock\r\nof the Hôtel de Ville, sounding the tocsin for a general massacre, and\r\ntriumphing in the revolutionary tribunal.\r\n\r\nMarat, like Milton's Sin, was violated by death[41]: Chénier wrote his\r\napotheosis, David[42] painted him in his blood-stained bath; he was\r\ncompared to the divine Author of the Gospel. A prayer was dedicated to\r\nhim: \"Heart of Jesus, Heart of Marat; O Sacred Heart of Jesus, O Sacred\r\nHeart of Marat!\" This heart of Marat had for a ciborium a costly pyx\r\nfrom the Royal Repository. In a grass-grown cenotaph, erected on the\r\nPlace du Carrousel, were exhibited the divinity's bust, his bath, lamp,\r\nand inkstand. Then the wind changed: the unclean thing, poured from its\r\nagate urn into a different vase, was emptied into the sewer.\r\n\r\n*\r\n\r\nThe scenes at the Cordeliers, of which I witnessed some three or four,\r\nwere dominated and presided over by Danton, a Hun of Gothic stature,\r\nwith a flat nose, outspread nostrils, furrowed jaws, and the face of\r\na gendarme combined with that of a lewd and cruel attorney. In the\r\nshell of his church, as it were the skeleton of the centuries, Danton,\r\nwith his three male furies, Camille Desmoulins, Marat, and Fabre\r\nd'Églantine[43], organized the assassinations of September. Billaud de\r\nVarennes[44] proposed to set fire to the prisons and burn all those\r\ninside; another Conventional voted that all the untried prisoners\r\nshould be drowned; Marat declared himself in favour of a general\r\nmassacre. Danton was besought to show mercy to the prisoners:\r\n\r\n\"----the prisoners!\" he replied.\r\n\r\nAs author of the circular of the Commune, he invited free men to repeat\r\nin the departments the enormities perpetrated at the Carmelites and the\r\nAbbaye.\r\n\r\nLet us consider history: Sixtus V.[45] pronounced the devotion of\r\nJacques Clément[46] to be equal, for the salvation of mankind, to the\r\nmystery of the Incarnation, even as Marat was compared to the Saviour\r\nof the World; Charles IX.[47] wrote to the governors of provinces to\r\nimitate the St. Bartholomew[48] massacres, even as Danton summoned\r\nthe patriots to copy the massacres of September. The Jacobins were\r\nplagiaries; they were still more so when they offered up Louis XVI.\r\nin imitation of Charles I.[49] As these crimes were connected with a\r\ngreat social movement, some have, very unaptly, imagined that those\r\ncrimes produced the greatness of the Revolution, of which they were\r\nbut the hideous _pasticcios_: while watching a fine nature suffering,\r\npassionate or systematic minds have admired only its convulsions.\r\n\r\nDanton, more candid than the English, said:\r\n\r\n\"We will not try our King, we will kill him.\"\r\n\r\nHe also said:\r\n\r\n\"Those priests and nobles are not guilty, but they must die, because\r\nthey are out of place; they trammel the movement of things and obstruct\r\nthe future.\"\r\n\r\nThese words, beneath an appearance of horrible depth, possess no extent\r\nof genius, for they presume that innocence is nothing, and that moral\r\norder can be withdrawn from political order without causing the latter\r\nto perish, which is false.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Danton.]\r\n\r\nDanton had not the conviction of the principles he maintained; he had\r\ndonned the revolutionary cloak only to make his fortune.\r\n\r\n\"Come and 'brawl' with us,\" he advised a young man: \"when you have\r\ngrown rich, you can do as you please.\"\r\n\r\nHe admitted that, if he had not sold himself to the Court, it was\r\nbecause it would not pay a high enough price for him: an instance\r\nof the effrontery of a mind that knows itself and a corruption that\r\nreveals itself open-mouthed.\r\n\r\nThough inferior, even in ugliness, to Marat, whose agent he had been,\r\nDanton was superior to Robespierre, without, like the latter, having\r\ngiven his name to his crimes. He preserved the religious sense:\r\n\r\n\"We have not,\" he said, \"destroyed superstition to establish atheism.\"\r\n\r\nHis passions might have been good ones, if only because they were\r\npassions. We must allow for character in the actions of men; culprits\r\nwith heated imaginations like Danton seem, by reason of the very\r\nexaggeration of their sayings and doings, to be more froward than the\r\ncool-headed culprits, whereas in fact they are less so. This remark\r\napplies also to the people: taken collectively, the people is a poet,\r\nauthor and ardent actor of the piece which it plays or is made to play.\r\nIts excesses partake not so much of the instinct of a native cruelty\r\nas of the delirium of a crowd intoxicated with sights, especially when\r\nthese are tragic: a thing so true that, in popular horrors, there is\r\nalways something superfluous added to the picture and the emotion.\r\n\r\nDanton was caught in the trap himself had laid. It availed him nothing\r\nto flick pellets of bread at his judges' noses, to reply nobly and\r\ncourageously, to cause the tribunal to hesitate, to endanger and\r\nterrify the Convention, to reason logically upon crimes by which the\r\nvery power of his enemies had been created, to exclaim, smitten with\r\nbarren repentance, \"It was I who instituted this infamous tribunal: I\r\ncrave pardon for it of God and men!\" a phrase which has been pilfered\r\nmore than once. It was before being indicted before the tribunal that\r\nhe should have declared its infamy.\r\n\r\nIt only remained to Danton to show himself as pitiless for his own\r\ndeath as he had been for that of his victims, to hold his head higher\r\nthan the hanging knife: and this he did. From the stage of the Terror,\r\nwhere his feet stuck in the clotted blood of the previous day, after\r\nturning a glance of contempt and domination over the crowd, he said to\r\nthe headsman:\r\n\r\n\"Show my head to the people; it is worth showing.\"\r\n\r\nDanton's head remained in the executioner's hands, while the acephalous\r\nshade went to join the decapitated shades of his victims: a further\r\ninstance of equality. Danton's deacon and sub-deacon, Camille\r\nDesmoulins and Fabre d'Églantine, died in the same manner as their\r\npriest.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Camille Desmoulins.]\r\n\r\nAt a time when pensions were being paid to the guillotine, when one\r\nwore at the buttonhole of one's carmagnole, by way of a flower, a\r\nlittle guillotine in gold, or else a small piece of a guillotined\r\nperson's heart; at a time when people shouted, \"Hell for ever!\" when\r\nthey celebrated the joyful orgies of blood, steel and fury, when they\r\ntoasted annihilation, when they danced the dance of the dead quite\r\nnaked, so as not to have the trouble of undressing when about to\r\njoin them; at that time one was bound in the end to come to the last\r\nbanquet, the last pleasantry of sorrow. Desmoulins was invited to\r\nFouquier-Tinville's[50] tribunal.\r\n\r\n\"What is your age?\" asked the president.\r\n\r\n\"The age of the Sans-Culotte Jesus,\" replied Camille facetiously[51].\r\n\r\nAn avenging obsession compelled the assassins of Christians unceasingly\r\nto confess the name of Christ.\r\n\r\nIt would be unfair to forget that Camille Desmoulins dared to defy\r\nRobespierre and to atone for his errors by his courage. He gave the\r\nsignal for the reaction against the Terror. A young and charming wife,\r\nfull of energy, had, by making him capable of love, made him capable\r\nof virtue and sacrifice. Indignation instilled eloquence into the\r\ntribune's coarse and reckless irony: he attacked in the grand manner\r\nthe scaffolds he had helped to erect. Adapting his conduct to his\r\nspeech, he refused to consent to his execution; he struggled with the\r\nheadsman in the tumbril, and arrived at the edge of the last gulf with\r\nhis clothes half tom from his back.\r\n\r\nFabre d'Églantine, author of a play which will live[52], displayed,\r\nquite contrary to Desmoulins, a signal weakness. Jean Roseau, public\r\nexecutioner of Paris under the League, who was hanged for lending his\r\noffices to the assassins of the Président Brisson[53], could not bring\r\nhimself to accept the rope. It seems that one does not learn how to die\r\nby killing others.\r\n\r\nThe debates at the Cordeliers established for me the fact of a state of\r\nsociety at the most rapid moment of its transformation. I had seen the\r\nConstituent Assembly commence the murder of the kingship in 1789 and\r\n1790; I found the body, still quite warm, of the old monarchy handed\r\nover in 1792 to the legislative gut-workers: they disembowelled and\r\ndissected it in the cellars of their clubs, as the halberdiers cut up\r\nand burnt the body of the Balafré[54] in the garret of Blois Castle.\r\n\r\nOf all the men whom I recall, Danton, Marat. Camille Desmoulins, Fabre\r\nd'Églantine, Robespierre, not one is alive. I met them for a moment on\r\nmy passage between a nascent society in America and an expiring society\r\nin Europe; between the forests of the New World and the solitudes of\r\nexile: before I had reckoned a few months on foreign soil, those lovers\r\nof death had already spent themselves in her arms. At the distance\r\nat which I now find myself from their appearance, it seems to me as\r\nthough, after descending into the infernal regions of my youth, I\r\nretain a confused recollection of the shades which I vaguely saw wander\r\nby the bank of Cocytus: they complete the varied dreams of my life, and\r\ncome to be inscribed on my tablets of beyond the tomb.\r\n\r\n*\r\n\r\nIt was a great pleasure to meet M. de Malesherbes again and speak to\r\nhim of my old projects. I stated my plans for a second journey, which\r\nwas to last nine years; all I had to do first was to take another\r\nlittle journey to Germany: I was to run to the Army of the Princes, and\r\ncome back at a run to kill the Revolution; all this would be finished\r\nin two or three months, when I should hoist my sail and return to the\r\nNew World, having got rid of a revolution and enriched myself by a\r\nmarriage.\r\n\r\nAnd yet my zeal exceeded my faith; I felt that the emigration was a\r\nstupidity and a madness:\r\n\r\n\"I was shaven on all hands,\" says Montaigne. \"To the Ghibelin I was a\r\nGuelf, to Guelf a Ghibelin[55].\"\r\n\r\nMy distaste for absolute monarchy left me with no illusions concerning\r\nthe step I was taking. I cherished scruples, and, although resolved\r\nto sacrifice myself to honour, I desired to have M. de Malesherbes'\r\nopinion on the emigration. I found him much incensed: the crimes\r\ncontinued under his eyes had caused the friend of Rousseau to lose his\r\npolitical toleration; between the cause of the victims and that of the\r\nbutchers he did not hesitate. He believed that anything was better than\r\nthe existing state of things; he thought that, in my particular case, a\r\nman wearing the sword was bound to join the brothers of a King who was\r\noppressed and delivered to his enemies. He approved of my returning to\r\nAmerica, and urged my brother to go with me.\r\n\r\nI raised the ordinary objections based upon the assistance of\r\nforeigners, the interests of the country, and so on. He replied\r\nand, passing from general arguments to details, quoted some awkward\r\nexamples. He put before me the case of the Guelphs and Ghibhelinnes,\r\nrelying on the troops of the Emperor and the Pope; in England, the\r\nbarons rising against John Lackland. Finally, in our times, he quoted\r\nthe case of the Republic of the United States imploring the assistance\r\nof France.\r\n\r\n\"In the same way,\" continued M. de Malesherbes, \"the men most devoted\r\nto liberty and philosophy, the Republicans and Protestants, have never\r\nconsidered themselves to blame when they have borrowed a force which\r\ncould ensure the victory of their opinion. Would the New World be free\r\ntoday without our gold, our ships, and our soldiers? I, Malesherbes,\r\nwho am speaking to you, did not I, in 1776, receive Franklin, who\r\ncame to renew the relations entered into by Silas Deane[56], and yet\r\nwas Franklin a traitor? Was American liberty any the less honourable\r\nfor being assisted by La Fayette and won by French grenadiers? Every\r\ngovernment which, instead of securing the fundamental laws of society,\r\nitself transgresses the laws of equity, the rules of justice, ceases to\r\nexist, and restores man to the state of nature. It is then lawful to\r\ndefend one's self as best one may, to resort to the means that appear\r\nmost calculated to overthrow tyranny and to restore the rights of one\r\nand all.\"\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Talks with Malesherbes.]\r\n\r\nThe principles of natural right as set forth by the greatest\r\npublicists, developed by such a man as M. de Malesherbes, and supported\r\nby numerous historical examples, struck me without convincing me;\r\nI yielded in reality only to the impulse of my age, to the point\r\nof honour. I will add some more recent examples to those of M. de\r\nMalesherbes: during the Spanish War of 1823, the French Republican\r\nParty went to serve under the banner of the Cortès, and did not scruple\r\nto bear arms against its own country; in 1830 and 1831, the Poles and\r\nthe constitutional Italians invoked the assistance of France, and the\r\nPortuguese of the \"Charter\" invaded their country with the aid of\r\nforeign money and foreign soldiers. We have two standards of weight\r\nand measurement: we approve in the case of one idea, one system, one\r\ninterest, one man of that which we condemn in the case of another idea,\r\nanother system, another interest, another man.\r\n\r\nThese conversations between myself and the illustrious defender of the\r\nKing took place at my sister-in-law's; she had just given birth to a\r\nsecond son, to whom M. de Malesherbes stood god-father and gave his\r\nname, Christian. I was present at the baptism of this child, which\r\nwas to see its father and mother only at an age at which life leaves\r\nno memory and appears at a distance like an ill-remembered dream. The\r\npreparations for my departure lagged. They had thought that they were\r\nmaking me contract a rich marriage: it appeared that my wife's fortune\r\nwas invested in Church securities; the nation undertook to pay them\r\nafter its own fashion. Not only that, but Madame de Chateaubriand had,\r\nwith the consent of her trustees, lent the scrip of a large portion of\r\nthese securities to her sister, the Comtesse du Plessix-Parscau, who\r\nhad emigrated. Money was still wanting, therefore; it became necessary\r\nto borrow.\r\n\r\nA notary procured ten thousand francs for us: I was taking them home to\r\nthe Cul-de-sac Férou, in _assignats_, when, in the Rue de Richelieu, I\r\nmet one of my old messmates in the Navarre Regiment, the Comte Achard.\r\nHe was a great gambler; he proposed that we should go to the rooms of\r\nM----, where we could talk; the devil urged me: I went upstairs, I\r\nplayed, I lost all, except fifteen hundred francs, with which, full of\r\nremorse and humiliation, I climbed into the first coach that passed.\r\nI had never played before: play produced in me a sort of painful\r\nintoxication; if the passion had attacked me, it would have turned\r\nmy brain. With half-disordered wits, I stepped out of the coach at\r\nSaint-Sulpice, and left my pocket-book behind, containing the remnant\r\nof my treasure. I ran home and said that I had left the ten thousand\r\nfrancs in a hackney-coach.\r\n\r\nI went out again, turned down the Rue Dauphine, crossed the Pont-Neuf,\r\nfeeling half inclined to throw myself into the water; I went to the\r\nPlace du Palais-Royal, where I had taken the ill-omened vehicle. I\r\nquestioned the Savoyards who watered the screws, and described my\r\nconveyance; they told me a number at random. The police commissary of\r\nthe district informed me that that number belonged to a job-master\r\nliving at the top of the Faubourg Saint-Denis. I went to the\r\nman's house; I remained all night in the stable, waiting for the\r\nhackney-coaches to return: a large number arrived in succession which\r\nwere not mine; at last, at two o'clock in the morning, I saw my chariot\r\ndrive in. I had hardly time to recognise my two white steeds, when the\r\npoor beasts, utterly worn out, dropped down upon the straw, stiff,\r\ntheir stomachs distended, their legs stretched out, as though dead.\r\n\r\nThe coachman remembered driving me. After me, he had taken up a\r\ncitizen, whom he had set down at the Jacobins; after the citizen, a\r\nlady, whom he had taken to the Rue de Cléry, number 13; after that\r\nlady, a gentleman, whom he had put down at the Recollects in the Rue\r\nSaint-Martin. I promised the driver a gratuity, and, the moment\r\ndaylight had come, set out on the discovery of my fifteen hundred\r\nfrancs, as I had gone in search of the North-West Passage. It seemed\r\nclear to me that the citizen of the Jacobins had confiscated them by\r\nright of his sovereignty. The young person of the Rue de Cléry averred\r\nthat she had seen nothing in the coach. I reached the third station\r\nwithout any hope; the coachman gave a tolerably good description of the\r\ngentleman he had driven. The porter exclaimed:\r\n\r\n\"It's the Père So-and-so!\"\r\n\r\nHe led me through the passages and the deserted apartments to a\r\nRecollect who had remained behind alone to make an inventory of the\r\nfurniture of his convent. Seated on a heap of rubbish, in a dusty\r\nfrock-coat, the monk listened to my story:\r\n\r\n\"Are you,\" he asked, \"the Chevalier de Chateaubriand?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes,\" I replied.\r\n\r\n\"Here is your pocket-book,\" said he. \"I would have brought it when I\r\nhad finished: I found your address inside.\"\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: An honest monk.]\r\n\r\nIt was this hunted and plundered monk, engaged in conscientiously\r\ncounting up the relics of his cloister for his proscribes, who restored\r\nto me the fifteen hundred francs with which I was about to make my\r\nway to exile. Failing this small sum, I should not have emigrated:\r\nwhat should I have become? My whole life would have changed. I will be\r\nhanged if I would to-day move a step to recover a million.\r\n\r\nThis happened on the 16th of June 1792. Obeying the promptings of\r\nmy instinct, I had returned from America to offer my sword to Louis\r\nXVI., not to associate myself with party intrigues. The disbanding of\r\nthe King's new guard, of which Murat[57] was a member; the successive\r\nministries of Roland[58], Dumouriez, Duport du Tertre[59]; the little\r\nconspiracies of the Court and the great popular risings filled me\r\nonly with weariness and contempt. I heard much talk of Madame Roland,\r\nwhom I never saw: her Memoirs show that she possessed an extraordinary\r\nstrength of mind. She was said to be very agreeable: it remains to be\r\nknown whether she was sufficiently so to make at all tolerable the\r\ncynicism of her unnatural virtues. Certainly the woman who, at the\r\nfoot of the guillotine, asked for pen and ink to describe the last\r\nmoments of her journey, to write down the discoveries she had made in\r\nthe course of her progress from the Conciergerie to the Place de la\r\nRévolution, that woman displayed an absorption in futurity, a contempt\r\nfor life, of which there are few examples. Madame Roland possessed\r\ncharacter rather than genius: the first can give the second, the second\r\ncannot give the first.\r\n\r\nOn the 19th of June, I went to the Vale of Montmorency to visit the\r\nHermitage of J. J. Rousseau: not that I delighted in the memories of\r\nMadame d'Épinay[60] and of that depraved and artificial society; but\r\nI wished to take leave of the solitude of a man whose morals were\r\nantipathetic to mine, although he himself was endowed with a talent\r\nwhose accents stirred my youth. On the next day, the 20th of June, I\r\nwas still at the Hermitage, and there met two men walking, like myself,\r\nin that deserted spot during the fatal day of the monarchy, indifferent\r\nas they were or might be, thought I, to the affairs of this world:\r\none was M. Maret[61], of the Empire, the other M. Barère[62], of the\r\nRepublic. The amiable Barère had come, far from the uproar, in his\r\nsentimental, philosophical way, to whisper soft revolutionary nothings\r\nto the shade of Julie. The troubadour of the guillotine, on whose\r\nreport the Convention decreed that the Terror was the order of the\r\nday, escaped the same Terror by hiding in the head-basket; from the\r\nbottom of the bloody trough, beneath the scaffold, he was heard only to\r\ncroak the word, \"Death!\" Barère belonged to the species of tigers which\r\nOppian represents as born of the wind's light breath: _velocis Zephyri\r\nproles._\r\n\r\nGinguené, Chamfort, my old friends among the men of letters, were\r\ndelighted with the 20th of June. La Harpe, continuing his lectures at\r\nthe Lycée, shouted in a stentorian voice:\r\n\r\n\"Fools! To all the representations of the people you answered,\r\n'Bayonets! Bayonets!' Well, you have them now, your bayonets!\"\r\n\r\nAlthough my travels in America had made a less insignificant personage\r\nof me, I was unable to rise to so great a height of principle and\r\neloquence. Fontanes was in danger through his former connection\r\nwith the Société Monarchique. My brother was a member of a club of\r\n_enragés._ The Prussians were marching by virtue of a convention\r\nbetween the Cabinets of Vienna and Berlin; a rather fierce engagement\r\nhad already taken place between the French and Austrians near Mons. It\r\nwas more than time for me to take a decision.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: My brother and I emigrate.]\r\n\r\nMy brother and I procured false passports for Lille: we were two\r\nwine-merchants and national guards of Paris, wearing the uniform\r\nand proposing to tender for the army supplies. My brother's valet,\r\nLouis Poullain, known as Saint-Louis, travelled under his own name;\r\nhe came from Lamballe, in Lower Brittany, but was going to see his\r\nfamily in Flanders. The day of our emigration was settled for the\r\n15th of July, the day after the second Federation. We spent the 14th\r\nin the Tivoli garden, with the Rosanbo family, my sisters and my\r\nwife. Tivoli belonged to M. Boutin[63], whose daughter had married\r\nM. de Malesherbes[64]. Towards the end of the day we saw a good many\r\nfederates wandering about after disbanding; on their hats was written\r\nin chalk, \"Pétion or death!\" Tivoli, the starting-point of my exile,\r\nwas to become a centre of amusements and fêtes. Our relations took\r\nleave of us without sadness; they were persuaded that we were going on\r\na pleasure-trip. My recovered fifteen hundred francs seemed a treasure\r\nsufficient to bring me back in triumph to Paris.\r\n\r\nOn the 10th of July, at six o'clock in the morning, we climbed into the\r\ndiligence: we had booked our seats in the front part, by the guard;\r\nthe valet, whom we were supposed not to know, stuffed himself into the\r\ninside with the other passengers. Saint-Louis walked in his sleep; in\r\nParis he used to go looking for his master at night, with his eyes\r\nopen, but quite asleep. He used to undress my brother and put him to\r\nbed, sleeping all the time, answering, \"I know, I know,\" to all that\r\nwas said to him during his attacks, and waking only when cold water was\r\nthrown in his face: he was a man of about forty, nearly six feet high,\r\nand as ugly as he was tall. This poor fellow, who was very respectful\r\nby nature, had never served any master except my brother; he was quite\r\nconfused when he had to sit down to table with us at supper. The\r\npassengers, great patriots all, talking of hanging the aristocrats from\r\nthe lanterns, increased his dismay. The thought that, at the end of all\r\nthis, he would be obliged to pass through the Austrian Army, in order\r\nto fight in the Army of the Princes, completely turned his brain. He\r\ndrank heavily and climbed into the diligence again; we went back to the\r\ncoupé.\r\n\r\nIn the middle of the night we heard the passengers shouting, with their\r\nheads out of the windows:\r\n\r\n\"Stop, postilion, stop!\"\r\n\r\nThey stopped, the door of the diligence was opened, and immediately\r\nmale and female voices exclaimed:\r\n\r\n\"Get down, citizen, get down! We can't stand this! Get down, you beast!\r\nHe's a brigand! Get down, get down!\"\r\n\r\nWe got down too, and saw Saint-Louis hustled, flung out of the coach,\r\nstand up, turn his wide-open but sleeping eyes around him, and take\r\nto flight in the direction of Paris, without his hat, and as fast as\r\nhis legs would carry him. We were unable to acknowledge him, or we\r\nshould have betrayed ourselves; we had to leave him to his fate. He was\r\ncaught and taken up at the first village, and stated that he was the\r\nservant of M. le Comte de Chateaubriand, and that he lived in the Rue\r\nde Bondy, Paris. The rural police passed him on from brigade to brigade\r\nto the Président de Rosanbo's; the unhappy man's depositions served to\r\nprove our emigration, and to send my brother and sister-in-law to the\r\nscaffold.\r\n\r\nThe next day, when the diligence stopped for breakfast, we had to\r\nlisten to the whole story a score of times:\r\n\r\n\"That man had a perturbed imagination; he was dreaming out loud; he\r\nsaid strange things; he was no doubt a conspirator, an assassin fleeing\r\nfrom justice.\"\r\n\r\nThe well-bred citizenesses blushed and waved large green-paper\r\n\"Constitutional\" fans. We easily recognised through these stories the\r\neffects of somnambulism, fear and wine.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: We cross the frontier.]\r\n\r\nOn reaching Lille, we went in search of the person who was to take\r\nus across the frontier. The Emigration had its agents of safety who\r\neventually became agents of perdition. The monarchical party was still\r\npowerful, the question undecided: the weak and cowardly served, while\r\nawaiting the turn of events. We left Lille before the gates were\r\nclosed: we stopped at a remote house, and did not start until ten\r\no'clock at night, when it was quite dark; we carried nothing with us;\r\nwe had a little cane in our hands; it was no more than a year since I,\r\nin the same way, followed my Dutchman in the American forests.\r\n\r\nWe crossed cornfields through which wound hardly traceable footpaths.\r\nThe French and Austrian patrols were beating the country-side: we\r\nwere liable to fall in with either, or to find ourselves in front of\r\nthe pistols of a vedette. We saw single horsemen in the distance,\r\nmotionless, weapon in hand; we heard the hoofs of horses in the hollow\r\nroads; laying our ears against the ground, we heard the regular tramp\r\nof infantry marching. After three hours spent alternately in running\r\nand in creeping along on tiptoe, we reached a cross-road in a wood\r\nwhere some belated nightingales were singing. A troop of uhlans, posted\r\nbehind a hedge, fell upon us with raised sabres. We shouted:\r\n\r\n\"Officers going to join the Princes!\"\r\n\r\nWe asked to be taken to Tournay, saying we were in a position to make\r\nourselves known. The officer in command placed us between his troopers\r\nand carried us off. When day broke, the uhlans perceived our national\r\nguards' uniforms under our surtouts, and insulted the colours in which\r\nFrance was soon to dress her vassal, Europe.\r\n\r\nIn Tournaisis, the primitive kingdom of the Franks, Clovis resided\r\nduring the early years of his reign; he set out from Tournay with his\r\ncompanions, summoned as he was to the conquest of the Gauls: \"Arms\r\nalways have right on their side,\" says Tacitus. Through this town, from\r\nwhich, in 486, the first King of the First Race[65] rode to found his\r\nlong and mighty monarchy, I passed in 1792 to go and join the Princes\r\nof the Third Race on foreign soil, and I passed through it again in\r\n1815, when the last King of the French abandoned the kingdom of the\r\nfirst King of the Franks: _omnia migrant._\r\n\r\nWhen we reached Tournay, I left my brother to grapple with the\r\nauthorities, and in the custody of a soldier visited the cathedral. In\r\ndays of old, Odo of Orleans, the scholasticus of the cathedral, seated\r\nat night before the church porch, taught his disciples the course of\r\nthe planets, and pointed out to them the Milky Way and the stars.\r\nI would rather have found this artless eleventh-century astronomer\r\nat Tournay than the Pandours. I delight in those days in which the\r\nchronicles tell me, under the year 1049, that, in Normandy, a man had\r\nbeen transformed into a donkey: that was like to have happened to me,\r\nas the reader knows, at the house of the Demoiselles Couppart, who\r\ntaught me to read. Hildebert[66], in 1114, saw a girl from whose ears\r\ngrew spikes of corn: perhaps it was Ceres. The Meuse, which I was\r\nsoon to cross, was suspended in mid-air in the year 1118, as witness\r\nGuillaume de Nangis[67] and Albéric[68]. Rigord[69] assures us that,\r\nin 1194, between Compiègne and Clermont in Beauvoisis, there fell a\r\nstorm of hail, mixed with ravens which carried charcoal and caused a\r\nfire. If the tempest, as Gervase of Tilbury[70] tells us, was unable to\r\nextinguish a candle on the window-sill of the priory of Saint-Michel\r\n\"de Camissa,\" we also know through him that, in the Diocese of Uzès,\r\nthere was a fair and clear spring which changed its place when anything\r\nunclean was thrown into it: our latter-day consciences do not put\r\nthemselves out for so little.\r\n\r\nReader, I am not wasting time; I am chatting with you to keep you in\r\npatience while waiting for my brother, who is arranging things: here\r\nhe comes, after explaining himself to the satisfaction of the Austrian\r\ncommander. We have leave to go on to Brussels, an exile purchased with\r\ntoo much care and trouble.\r\n\r\n*\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Brussels.]\r\n\r\nBrussels was the head-quarters of the upper Emigration: the most\r\nelegant women of Paris and the most fashionable men, those who were\r\nable to march only as aides-de-camp, were awaiting amid pleasures the\r\nmoment of victory. They had fine brand-new uniforms; they paraded\r\nthe very pedantry of frivolity. Considerable sums, enough to keep\r\nthem for a few years, were squandered in a few days: it was not worth\r\nwhile economizing, since we should be in Paris directly. Those gallant\r\nknights, reversing the practice of the olden chivalry, were preparing\r\nfor glory with successes in love. They scornfully watched us trudging\r\non foot, knapsack on back, small provincial gentlemen that we were, or\r\npoor officers turned into private soldiers. Those Hercules sat at the\r\nfeet of their Omphales spinning the distaffs which they had sent us and\r\nwhich we handed back to them as we passed, contenting ourselves with\r\nour swords.\r\n\r\nIn Brussels I found my scanty luggage, which had fraudulently passed\r\nthe customs ahead of me: it consisted of my Navarre uniform, a little\r\nlinen, and my precious papers, with which I could not part. I was\r\ninvited with my brother to dine at the Baron de Breteuil's; I there met\r\nthe Baronne de Montmorency, then young and beautiful, at this moment\r\ndying; martyr bishops in watered-silk cassocks and gold crosses; young\r\nmagistrates transformed into Hungarian colonels; and Rivarol, whom I\r\nsaw only once in my life. His name had not been mentioned; I was struck\r\nby the conversation of a man who held forth all alone and was listened\r\nto, with some right, as an oracle. Rivarol's wit was prejudicial to his\r\ntalent, as his tongue was to his pen. Talking of revolutions, he said:\r\n\r\n\"The first blow aims at God, the second strikes only a senseless slab\r\nof marble.\"\r\n\r\nI had resumed my uniform of a petty infantry subaltern; I was to start\r\non rising from dinner, and my knapsack was behind the door. I was still\r\nbronzed by the American sun and the sea air; I wore my hair uncurled\r\nand unpowdered. My face and my silence troubled Rivarol; the Baron de\r\nBreteuil, perceiving his restless curiosity, satisfied it:\r\n\r\n\"Where does your brother the chevalier come from?\" he asked my brother.\r\n\r\nI answered:\r\n\r\n\"From Niagara.\"\r\n\r\nRivarol cried:\r\n\r\n\"From the cataract!\"\r\n\r\nI was silent. He hazarded an uncompleted question:\r\n\r\n\"Monsieur is going----?\"\r\n\r\n\"Where they are fighting,\" I broke in.\r\n\r\nWe rose from table.\r\n\r\nThis fatuous Emigrant society was hateful to me; I was eager to see my\r\npeers, Emigrants like myself with six hundred francs a year. We were\r\nvery stupid, no doubt, but at least we aired our sword-blades, and, if\r\nwe had obtained any successes, we should have been the last to profit\r\nby victory.\r\n\r\nMy brother remained at Brussels with the Baron de Montboissier[71], who\r\nappointed him his aide-de-camp; I set out alone for Coblentz.\r\n\r\nThere is no more historic road than that which I followed; it recalled\r\nin every part some memory or greatness of France. I passed through\r\nLiège, one of those municipal republics which so often rose against\r\ntheir bishops or against the Counts of Flanders. Louis XI.[72], the\r\nally of the Liégeois, was obliged to assist at the sack of their town\r\nin order to escape from his ridiculous prison of Péronne. I was about\r\nto join and to become one of the soldiers who glory in such things. In\r\n1792, the relations between Liège and France were more peaceful: the\r\nAbbot of Saint-Hubert was obliged every year to send two hounds to King\r\nDagobert's successors.\r\n\r\nAt Aix-la-Chapelle there was another offering, but on the part of\r\nFrance: the pall that had served at the funeral of a Most Christian\r\nKing was sent to the tomb of Charlemagne as a vassal banner to the\r\nlord's fief. Our kings thus did fealty and homage on taking possession\r\nof the inheritance of Eternity: laying their hands between the knees\r\nof their liege-lady, Death, they swore to be faithful to her, after\r\npressing the feudal kiss on her mouth. This, however, was the only\r\nsuzerain of whom France acknowledged herself the vassal.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Le Comte de Rivarol.]\r\n\r\nThe Cathedral of Aix-la-Chapelle was built by Karl the Great and\r\nconsecrated by Leo III[73]. Two prelates failing to attend the\r\nceremony, their places were filled by two Bishops of Maastricht, long\r\ndeceased, and resuscitated for the purpose. Charlemagne, having lost\r\na beautiful mistress, pressed her body in his arms and refused to be\r\nseparated from it. His passion was attributed to a charm: the young\r\ncorpse was examined, and a tiny pearl found beneath the tongue. The\r\npearl was flung into a marsh; Charlemagne became madly enamoured of\r\nthe marsh, and ordered it to be filled up: there he built a palace and\r\na church, to spend his life in one and his death in the other. The\r\nauthorities here are Archbishop Turpin[74] and Petrarch[75].\r\n\r\nAt Cologne I admired the cathedral: if it were finished, it would be\r\nthe finest Gothic monument in Europe. The monks were the painters,\r\nthe sculptors, the architects, and the masons of their basilicas;\r\nthey gloried in the title of master-mason, _cœmentarius._ It is\r\ncurious to hear ignorant philosophers and chattering democrats cry out\r\nto-day against the monks, as though those frocked proletarians, those\r\nmendicant orders to whom we owe almost everything, had been gentlemen!\r\n\r\nCologne reminded me of Caligula[76] and St. Bruno[77]; I have seen the\r\nremains of the dykes built by the former at Baiæ, and the deserted\r\ncell of the latter at the Grande Chartreuse.\r\n\r\nI went up the Rhine as far as Coblentz: _Confluentia._ The Army of the\r\nPrinces was no longer there. I crossed those empty kingdoms: _inania\r\nregna_; I saw the beautiful valley of the Rhine, the Tempe of the\r\nbarbarian muses, where the knights appeared around the ruins of their\r\ncastles, where one hears the clash of arms at night, when war is at\r\nhand.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Frederic William II.]\r\n\r\nBetween Coblentz and Trèves, I fell in with the Prussian Army: I was\r\npassing along the column when, coming up with the guards, I noticed\r\nthat they were marching in battle order, with cannon in line; the\r\nKing[78] and the Duke of Brunswick[79] were in the centre of the\r\nsquare, composed of Frederic's old grenadiers. My white uniform caught\r\nthe King's eye: he sent for me; the Duke of Brunswick and he took off\r\ntheir hats and saluted the old French Army in my person. They asked me\r\nmy name, my regiment, the place where I was going to join the Princes.\r\nThis military welcome touched me: I replied with emotion that, on\r\nlearning in America of my King's misfortunes, I had returned to shed my\r\nblood in his service. The generals and officers surrounding Frederic\r\nWilliam made a movement of approbation, and the Prussian sovereign said:\r\n\r\n\"Sir, one always recognises the sentiments of the French nobility.\"\r\n\r\nHe took off his hat again and stood uncovered and motionless, until I\r\nhad disappeared behind the mass of the grenadiers. Nowadays people cry\r\nout against the Emigrants: they are \"tigers who rent their mother's\r\nbosom;\" at the time of which I speak, men loved the examples of old,\r\nand honour ranked as high as country. In 1792, fidelity to one's oath\r\nwas still accounted a duty; to-day, it has become so rare that it is\r\nregarded as a virtue.\r\n\r\nA strange scene, already rehearsed with others than myself, almost made\r\nme retrace my steps. They refused to admit me at Trèves, where the Army\r\nof the Princes was:\r\n\r\n\"I was one of those men who await the course of events before making\r\nup their minds; I ought to have joined the cantonment three years ago;\r\nI came when victory was assured. They had no use for me; they had only\r\ntoo many of those heroes after the battle. Every day, squadrons of\r\ncavalry were deserting; even the artillery was melting away in a body;\r\nand, if that went on, they would not know what to do with those people!\"\r\n\r\nO prodigious illusionment of parties!\r\n\r\nI met my cousin Armand de Chateaubriand: he took me under his\r\nprotection, assembled the Bretons and pleaded my cause. They sent for\r\nme; I made my explanation: I told them that I had come from America\r\nto have the honour of serving beside my comrades; that the campaign\r\nwas opened, not commenced, so that I was still in time for the first\r\nfire; that, however, I would go back if they insisted, but not before\r\nI had obtained satisfaction for an undeserved insult. The matter was\r\narranged: as I was a good fellow, the ranks were opened to receive\r\nme, and my only difficulty was to make my selection.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Frederic William II.]\r\n\r\n*\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The Emigrant army.]\r\n\r\nThe Army of the Princes was composed of gentlemen, classed by provinces\r\nand serving as private soldiers: the nobility was harking back to its\r\norigin and to the origin of the monarchy, at the very moment when\r\nboth the nobility and monarchy were coming to an end, even as an old\r\nman returns to childhood. There were, moreover, brigades of Emigrant\r\nofficers of different regiments, who had also become soldiers: among\r\nthese were my messmates of Navarre, with their colonel, the Marquis\r\nde Mortemart, at their head. I was strongly tempted to enlist with\r\nLa Martinière, even though he should still be in love; but Armorican\r\npatriotism won the day. I enrolled myself in the seventh Breton\r\nCompany, commanded by M. de Goyon-Miniac[80]. The nobles of my province\r\nhad furnished seven companies; to these was added an eighth consisting\r\nof young men of the Third Estate: the steel-grey uniform of this\r\nlast company differed from that of the others, which was royal blue\r\nwith ermine facings. Men attached to the same cause and exposed to\r\nthe same dangers perpetuated their political inequalities by odious\r\ndistinctions: the true heroes were the plebeian soldiers, since no\r\nconsideration of personal interest entered into the sacrifice they made.\r\n\r\nEnumeration of our little army:\r\n\r\nInfantry of gentlemen-soldiers and officers; four companies of\r\ndeserters, dressed in the different uniforms of the regiments\r\nfrom which they came; one company of artillery; a few officers of\r\nengineers, with some guns, howitzers, and mortars of various calibres\r\n(the artillery and engineers, almost all of whom embraced the cause\r\nof the Revolution, achieved its success across the borders). A very\r\nfine cavalry, consisting of German carabineers, musketeers under\r\nthe command of the old Comte de Montmorin and naval officers from\r\nBrest, Rochefort, and Toulon, supported our infantry. The wholesale\r\nemigration of these last-named officers plunged naval France back into\r\nthe condition of weakness from which Louis XVI. had extricated it.\r\nNever since the days of Duquesne and Tourville[81] had our squadrons\r\ncovered themselves with more glory. My comrades were delighted: I had\r\ntears in my eyes when I saw pass before them those ocean dragons, who\r\nno longer commanded the ships with which they had humbled the English\r\nand delivered America. Instead of going in search of new continents to\r\nbequeath to France, these companions of La Pérouse sank into the mud of\r\nGermany. They rode the horse dedicated to Neptune; but they had changed\r\ntheir element, and the land was not for them. In vain their commander\r\ncarried at their head the tattered ensign of the _Belle-Poule_, the\r\nsacred relic of the White Flag, from whose shreds honour still hung,\r\nbut victory had fallen.\r\n\r\nWe had tents; we lacked all beside. Our muskets, of German make,\r\ntrumpery weapons and frightfully heavy, broke our shoulders, and were\r\noften not in a condition to be fired. I went through the whole campaign\r\nwith one of these firelocks, the hammer of which refused to fall.\r\n\r\nWe remained two days at Trèves. It was a great pleasure to me to see\r\nRoman ruins after having seen the nameless ruins of Ohio, to visit that\r\ntown so often sacked, of which Salvianus[82] said:\r\n\r\n\"O fugitives from Trèves, you ask again for theatres, you demand a\r\ncircus of the princes: for what State, I pray you; for what people, for\r\nwhat city? _Theatra igitur quæritis, circum a principibus postulatis?\r\nCui, quæso, statut, cui populo, cui civitati?_\"\r\n\r\nFugitives from France, where was the people for which we wished to\r\nrestore the monuments of St. Louis?\r\n\r\nI sat down, with my musket, among the ruins; I took from my knapsack\r\nthe manuscript of my travels in America; I arranged the separate sheets\r\non the grass around me; I read over and corrected a description of a\r\nforest, a passage of _Atala_, in the fragments of a Roman amphitheatre,\r\npreparing in this way to make the conquest of France. Then I put away\r\nmy treasure, the weight of which, combined with that of my shirts, my\r\ncloak, my tin can, my wicker bottle, and my little Homer, made me throw\r\nup blood.\r\n\r\nI tried to stuff _Atala_ into my cartridge-box with my useless\r\nammunition; my comrades made fun of me, and pulled at the sheets which\r\nstuck out on either side of the leather cover. Providence came to my\r\nrescue: one night, after sleeping in a hay-loft, I found, when I woke,\r\nthat my shirts were no longer in my sack; the thieves had left the\r\npapers. I praised God: that accident assured my \"fame\" and saved my\r\nlife, for the sixty pounds that pressed upon my shoulders would have\r\ndriven me into a consumption.\r\n\r\n\"How many shirts have I?\" asked Henry IV. of his body-servant.\r\n\r\n\"One dozen, Sire, and some of them are torn.\"\r\n\r\n\"And of handkerchiefs, is it not eight that I have?\"\r\n\r\n\"There are only five left now.\"\r\n\r\nThe Bearnese won the Battle of Ivry[83] without shirts; the loss of\r\nmine did not enable me to restore his kingdom to his descendants.\r\n\r\n*\r\n\r\nWe received orders to march on Thionville. We did five to six leagues\r\na day. The weather was terrible; we tramped through the rain and\r\nslush singing, _Ô Richard! ô mon roi!_ and _Pauvre Jacques!_[84] On\r\narriving at the encamping-place, having neither wagons nor provisions,\r\nwe went with donkeys, which followed the column like an Arab caravan,\r\nto hunt for food in the farms and villages. We paid for everything\r\nscrupulously; nevertheless I had to do fatigue duty for taking two\r\npears from the garden of a country-house without thinking. A great\r\nsteeple, a great river and a great lord are bad neighbours, says the\r\nproverb.\r\n\r\nWe pitched our tents at random, and were constantly obliged to beat the\r\ncanvas in order to flatten out the threads and prevent the water from\r\ncoming through. We were ten soldiers to every tent; each in turn took\r\ncharge of the cooking: one went for meat, another for bread, another\r\nfor wood, another for straw. I made wonderful soup; I received great\r\ncompliments on it, especially when I mixed milk and cabbage with the\r\nstew, in the Breton way. I had learnt among the Iroquois not to mind\r\nsmoke, so that I bore myself bravely before my fire of green and damp\r\nboughs. This soldier's life is very amusing; I imagined myself still\r\namong the Indians. As we sat at mess in our tent my comrades asked me\r\nfor tales of my travels; they told me some fine stories in return;\r\nwe all lied like a corporal in a tavern, with a conscript paying the\r\nreckoning.\r\n\r\nOne thing tired me: washing my linen; it had to be done, and often,\r\nfor the obliging robber had left me only one shirt, borrowed from\r\nmy cousin Armand, besides the one on my back. When I lay soaping my\r\nstockings, my pocket-handkerchiefs and my shirt by the edge of a\r\nstream, with my head down and my loins up, I was seized with fits of\r\ngiddiness; the motion of the arms gave me an unbearable pain in the\r\nchest. I was obliged to sit down among the horsetails and watercress;\r\nand, in the midst of the stir of war, I amused myself by watching the\r\nwater flow peacefully past. Lope de Vega[85] makes a shepherdess wash\r\nthe bandage of Love; that shepherdess would have been very useful to me\r\nfor a little birch-cloth turban which my Floridans had given me.\r\n\r\nAn army is generally composed of soldiers of nearly the same age, the\r\nsame height, the same strength. Very different was ours, a jumbled\r\ngathering of grown men, old men, children fresh from the dovecot,\r\njabbering Norman, Breton, Picard, Auvergnat, Gascon, Provençal,\r\nLanguedocian. A father served with his sons, a father-in-law with his\r\nson-in-law, an uncle with his nephews, a brother with a brother, a\r\ncousin with a cousin. This _arrière ban_, ridiculous as it appeared,\r\nhad something honourable and touching about it, because it was animated\r\nwith sincere convictions; it presented the spectacle of the old\r\nmonarchy and afforded a last glimpse of a dying world. I have seen old\r\nnoblemen, with stern looks, grey hair, torn coats, knapsack on back,\r\nmusket slung over the shoulder, drag themselves along with a stick and\r\nsupported by the arm by one of their sons; I have seen M. de Boishue,\r\nthe father of my schoolfellow killed at the States of Rennes in my\r\nsight, march solitary and sad, with his bare feet in the mud, carrying\r\nhis shoes at the point of his bayonet for fear of wearing them out;\r\nI have seen young wounded men lie under a tree, while a chaplain, in\r\nsurtout and stole, knelt by their side, sending them to St. Louis,\r\nwhose heirs they had striven to defend. The whole of this needy band,\r\nwhich received not a sou from the Princes, made war at its own expense,\r\nwhile the decrees finished despoiling it and threw our wives and\r\nmothers into prison.\r\n\r\nThe old men of former times were less unhappy and less lonely than\r\nthose of to-day: if, in lingering upon earth, they had lost their\r\nfriends, there was but little changed around them besides; they\r\nwere strangers to youth, but not to society. Nowadays, a lagger in\r\nthis world has witnessed the death not only of men, but of ideas:\r\nprinciples, manners, tastes, pleasures, pains, opinions, none of these\r\nresemble what he used to know. He belongs to a race different from that\r\namong which he ends his days.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Old France.]\r\n\r\nAnd yet, O nineteenth-century France, learn to prize that old France\r\nwhich was as good as you. You will grow old in your turn and you will\r\nbe accused, as we were accused, of clinging to obsolete ideas. The\r\nmen whom you have vanquished are your fathers; do not deny them, you\r\nare sprung from their blood. Had they not been generously faithful\r\nto the ancient traditions, you would not have drawn from that native\r\nfidelity the energy which has been the cause of your glory in the new\r\ntraditions: between the old France and the new, all that has happened\r\nis a transformation of virtue.\r\n\r\n*\r\n\r\nNear our poor and obscure camp was another which was brilliant and\r\nrich. At the staff, one saw nothing but wagons full of eatables, met\r\nwith none save cooks, valets, aides-de-camp. Nothing could have better\r\nreproduced the Court and the provinces, the monarchy expiring at\r\nVersailles and the monarchy dying on Du Guesclin's heaths. We had grown\r\nto hate the aides-de-camp; whenever there was an engagement outside\r\nThionville, we shouted, \"Forward, the aides-de-camp!\" just as the\r\npatriots used to shout, \"Forward, the officers!\"\r\n\r\nI felt a chill at my heart when, arriving one dark day in sight of\r\nsome woods that lined the horizon, we were told that those woods were\r\nin France. To cross the frontier of my country in arms had an effect\r\nupon me which I am unable to convey. I had, as it were, a sort of\r\nrevelation of the future, inasmuch as I shared none of my comrades'\r\nillusions, either with regard to the cause they were supporting or the\r\nthoughts of triumph with which they deluded themselves: I was there\r\nlike Falkland[86] in the army of Charles I. There was not a Knight of\r\nthe Mancha, sick, lame, wearing a night-cap under his three-cornered\r\nbeaver, but was most firmly convinced of his ability, unaided, to\r\nput fifty young and vigorous patriots to flight. This honourable and\r\nagreeable pride, at another time the source of prodigies, had not\r\nattacked me: I did not feel so sure of the strength of my invincible\r\narm.\r\n\r\nWe reached Thionville unconquered on the 1st of September; for we had\r\nmet nobody on the road. The cavalry encamped to the right, the infantry\r\nto the left of the high-road running from the town towards Germany.\r\nThe fortress was not visible from the camping-ground, but, six hundred\r\npaces ahead, one came to the ridge of a hill whence the eye swept the\r\nValley of the Moselle. The mounted men of the navy joined the right of\r\nour infantry to the Austrian corps of the Prince of Waldeck[87], while\r\nthe left of the infantry was covered by 1800 horse of the Maison-Rouge\r\nand Royal German Regiments. We entrenched our front with a fosse,\r\nalong which the arms were stalked in line. The eight Breton companies\r\noccupied two intersecting streets of the camp, and below us was dressed\r\nthe company of the Navarre officers, my former messmates.\r\n\r\nWhen these field-works, which took three days, were completed, Monsieur\r\nand the Comte d'Artois arrived; they reconnoitred the place, which\r\nwas called upon in vain to surrender, although Wimpfen[88] seemed\r\nwilling to do so. Like the Grand Condé[89], we had not won the Battle\r\nof Rocroi, and so we were not able to capture Thionville; but we were\r\nnot beaten under its walls, like Feuquières[90]. We took up a position\r\non the high-road, at the end of a village which formed a suburb of the\r\ntown, outside the horn-work which defended the bridge over the Moselle.\r\nThe troops fired at each other from the houses; our post remained in\r\npossession of those which it had taken. I was not present at this first\r\naction. Armand, my cousin, was there and behaved well. While they were\r\nfighting in the village, my company was requisitioned to establish a\r\nbattery on the skirt of a wood which capped the summit of a hill. Along\r\nthe slope of this hill, vineyards ran down to the plain joining the\r\nouter fortifications of Thionville.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The siege of Thionville.]\r\n\r\nThe engineer directing us made us throw up a gazoned cavalier for\r\nour guns; we drew a parallel open trench to place us below the\r\ncannon-balls. These earthworks took long in making, for we were all,\r\nyoung officers and old alike, unaccustomed to wield the mattock and\r\nspade. We had no wheelbarrows and carried the earth in our coats, which\r\nwe used as sacks. Fire was opened on us from a lunette; it was the\r\nmore irksome to us in that we were unable to reply: eight-pounders and\r\na Cohorn howitzer, which was outranged, formed all our artillery. The\r\nfirst shell we fired fell outside the glacis and aroused the jeers of\r\nthe garrison. A few days later, we were joined by some Austrian guns\r\nand gunners. One hundred infantry men and a picket of the naval cavalry\r\nwere relieved at this battery every twenty-four hours. The besieged\r\nprepared to attack it; we could distinguish a movement on the rampart\r\nthrough the telescope. When night fell, we saw a column issue through\r\na postern and reach the lunette under shelter of the covert way. My\r\ncompany was ordered up as a reinforcement.\r\n\r\nAt daybreak, five or six hundred patriots began operations in the\r\nvillage, on the high-road above the town; then, turning to the left,\r\nthey came through the vineyards to take our battery in flank. The\r\nsailors charged bravely, but were overthrown and unmasked us. We were\r\ntoo badly armed to return the fire; we pushed forward with fixed\r\nbayonets. The attacking party retreated, I know not why; had they held\r\ntheir ground, they would have wiped us out.\r\n\r\nWe had several wounded and a few dead, among others the Chevalier de La\r\nBaronnais[91], captain of one of the Breton companies. I brought him\r\nill-luck: the bullet which took his life ricochetted against the barrel\r\nof my musket and struck him with such force as to pierce both his\r\ntemples; his brains were scattered over my face. Noble and unnecessary\r\nvictim of a lost cause! When the Maréchal d'Aubeterre[92] held the\r\nStates of Brittany, he went to M. de La Baronnais, the father, a\r\npoor nobleman, living at Dinard, near Saint-Malo. The Marshal, who\r\nhad begged him to invite nobody, saw, on entering, a table laid for\r\ntwenty-five, and scolded his host in friendly fashion.\r\n\r\n\"Monseigneur,\" said M. de La Baronnais, \"I have only my children to\r\ndinner.\"\r\n\r\nM. de La Baronnais had twenty-two boys and a girl, all by the same\r\nmother. The Revolution reaped this rich family harvest before it was\r\nripe.\r\n\r\n*\r\n\r\nWaldeck's Austrian corps began operations. The attack became livelier\r\non our side. It was a fine spectacle at night: fire-pots lit up the\r\nworks of the place covered with soldiers; sudden gleams struck the\r\nclouds or the blue firmament when the guns were fired, and the bombs,\r\ncrossing each other in the air, described a parabola of light. In\r\nthe intervals between the reports, one heard drums rolling, gusts of\r\nmilitary music, and the voices of the sentries on the ramparts of\r\nThionville and at our own posts; unfortunately, they called out in\r\nFrench in both camps:\r\n\r\n\"_Sentinelles, prenez garde à vous!_ All's well!\"\r\n\r\nWhen the fighting took place, at dawn, it would happen that the lark's\r\nmorning hymn followed upon the sound of musketry, while the guns,\r\nwhich had ceased firing, silently stared at us, with gaping mouths,\r\nthrough the embrasures. The song of the bird, recalling the memories of\r\npastoral life, seemed to utter a reproach to mankind. It was the same\r\nwhen I came across some dead bodies in the middle of fields of lucerne\r\nin flower, or by the edge of a stream of water which bathed the hair of\r\nthe slain. In the woods, at a few steps from the stress of war, I found\r\nlittle statues of the Saints and the Virgin. A goat-herd, a neat-herd,\r\na beggar carrying his wallet knelt beside these peace-makers, telling\r\ntheir beads to the distant sound of cannon. A whole township once came\r\nwith its minister to present flowers to the patron of a neighbouring\r\nparish, whose image dwelt in a wood, opposite a spring. The curate was\r\nblind: a soldier in God's army, he had lost his sight in doing good\r\nworks, like a grenadier on the battlefield. The vicar administered\r\ncommunion for his curate, because the latter could not have laid the\r\nconsecrated wafer upon the lips of the communicants. During this\r\nceremony, and from the depths of night, he blessed the light!\r\n\r\nOur fathers believed that the patrons of the hamlets, John \"the\r\nSilent[93],\" Dominic \"Loricatus[94],\" James \"Intercisus[95],\" Paul\r\n\"the Simple[96],\" Basil \"the Hermit[97],\" and so many others, were no\r\nstrangers to the triumph of the arms which protect the harvests. On the\r\nvery day of the Battle of Bouvines[98], robbers broke into a convent\r\ndedicated to St. Germanus[99] at Auxerre, and stole the consecrated\r\nvessels. The sacristan went to the shrine of the blessed bishop and\r\nsaid plaintively:\r\n\r\n\"Germanus, where wert thou when those thieves dared to violate thy\r\nsanctuary?\"\r\n\r\nA voice issuing from the shrine replied:\r\n\r\n\"I was near Cisoing, not far from Bouvines Bridge; together with other\r\nsaints, I was helping the French and their King, to whom a brilliant\r\nvictory has been given by our aid: _cui fuit auxilio victoria præstita\r\nnostro._\"\r\n\r\n*\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Fierce fighting.]\r\n\r\nWe beat the plain and pushed as far as the hamlets lying under the\r\nfirst entrenchments of Thionville. The village on the high-road\r\ncrossing the Moselle was constantly being captured and recaptured. I\r\ntook part in two of these assaults. The patriots abused us as \"enemies\r\nof liberty,\" \"aristocrats\" and \"Capet's satellites.\" We called them\r\n\"brigands,\" \"murderers,\" \"traitors\" and \"revolutionaries.\" Sometimes\r\nwe stopped fighting while a duel took place in the midst of the\r\ncombatants, who became impartial seconds: O strange French character,\r\nwhich even passions were unable to stifle!\r\n\r\nOne day, I was on patrol in a vineyard; twenty paces from me was an\r\nold sporting nobleman who banged the muzzle of his musket against the\r\nvine-stocks, as though to start a hare, and then looked sharply round,\r\nin the hope of seeing a \"patriot\" leap out: every one had brought his\r\nown habits with him.\r\n\r\nAnother day, I went to visit the Austrian camp. Between the camp and\r\nthat of the naval cavalry, a wood spread its screen, against which the\r\nplace was directing an inexpedient fire; the town was shooting too\r\nmuch, it believed us to be more numerous than we were, which explains\r\nthe pompous bulletins of the commander of Thionville. While crossing\r\nthis wood, I saw something move in the grass: a man lay stretched at\r\nfull length with his nose against the ground, showing only his broad\r\nback. I thought he was wounded: I took him by the nape of the neck and\r\nhalf lifted his head. He opened a pair of terror-struck eyes and raised\r\nhimself a little upon his hands. I burst out laughing: it was my cousin\r\nMoreau! I had not seen him since our visit to Madame de Chastenay.\r\n\r\nHe had lain flat on his stomach to escape a bomb, and found it\r\nimpossible to get up again. I had all the difficulty in the world to\r\nset him on his legs; his paunch was three times its former size. He\r\ntold me that he was serving on the commissariat, and that he was on his\r\nway to offer some oxen to the Prince of Waldeck. In addition to this,\r\nhe carried a rosary. Hugues Métel[100] tells of a wolf which resolved\r\nto embrace the monastic condition, but which, failing to accustom\r\nitself to the fasting diet, became a canon.\r\n\r\nAs I returned to camp, an officer of engineers passed close by me,\r\nleading his horse by the bridle; a cannon-ball struck the animal in\r\nthe narrowest part of the neck and cut it right off; the head and neck\r\nremained hanging in the officer's hand and dragged him to the ground\r\nwith their weight. I had seen a bomb fall in the middle of a ring of\r\nnaval officers who were sitting eating in a circle. The mess-platter\r\ndisappeared; the officers, tumbling head over heels and run, as it\r\nwere, on a sand-bank, shouted like the old sea captain:\r\n\r\n\"Fire starboard guns, fire larboard guns, fire all guns, fire my wig!\"\r\n\r\nThese singular shots seem to pertain to Thionville. In 1558, François\r\nde Guise[101] laid siege to the place. Marshal Strozzi[102] was killed,\r\n\"while talking in the trenches to the aforesaid Sieur de Guise, who had\r\nhis hand on his shoulder at the time.\"\r\n\r\n*\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Market in camp.]\r\n\r\nA sort of market had been formed behind our camp. The peasants had\r\nbrought octaves of white Moselle wine, which remained on the wagons:\r\nthe horses were taken out and ate fastened to one end of the cart,\r\nwhile the soldiers drank at the other end. Here and there gleamed the\r\nfires of ovens. Sausages were fried in pans, hasty puddings boiled\r\nin basins, pancakes tossed on iron dishes, puffcakes swollen out on\r\nhampers. Cakes flavoured with aniseed, rye loaves at one sou, maize\r\ncakes, green apples, red and white eggs, pipes and tobacco were sold\r\nunder a tree from whose branches hung coarse cloth great-coats, for\r\nwhich the passers-by haggled. Village women, seated astride portable\r\nstools, milked cows, while each presented his cup to the dairy-woman\r\nand waited his turn. Before the stoves roamed cutlers in smocks and\r\nsoldiers in uniform. The canteen-women went about crying aloud in\r\nGerman and French. There were groups standing, others seated at deal\r\ntables planted askew on the uneven ground. One sought shelter at\r\nrandom under a packing cloth or under branches cut in the forest, as\r\non Palm Sunday. I believe also that there were weddings in the covered\r\nwagons, in memory of the Frankish kings. The patriots could easily have\r\nfollowed Majorian's[103] example and carried away the bride's chariot:\r\n_Rapit esseda victor, nubentemque nurum._[104] All sang, laughed,\r\nsmoked. The scene was extremely gay at night, between the fires which\r\nlit up the earth and the stars shining overhead.\r\n\r\nWhen I was neither on guard at the batteries nor on duty in the tent,\r\nI liked supping at the fair. There the stories of the camp were told\r\nagain; but under the influence of liquor and good cheer they became\r\nmuch finer. One of our fellows, a brevet-captain, whose name I have\r\nforgotten in that of \"Dinarzade\" which we gave him, was famous for\r\nhis yarns; it would have been more correct to say \"Scheherazade,\" but\r\nwe were not so careful as that. As soon as we saw him, we ran up to\r\nhim, fought for him: we vied with each other as to who should have him\r\non his score. Short of body, long of leg, with sunk cheeks, drooping\r\nmustachios, eyebrows forming a comma at the outer angle, a hollow\r\nvoice, a huge sword in a coffee-coloured scabbard, the carriage of a\r\nsoldier poet, something between the suicide and the jolly dog, that\r\nsolemn wag Dinarzade never laughed, and it was impossible to look at\r\nhim without laughing. He was the necessary second in all the duels and\r\nthe lover of all the barmaids. He viewed all he said on the dark side,\r\nand interrupted his recitals only to take a pull at a bottle, relight\r\nhis pipe, or swallow a sausage.\r\n\r\nOne night, when it was drizzling, we were seated round the tap of a\r\nwine-cask tilted towards us in a cart with its shafts in the air.\r\nA candle stuck on the cask lighted us; a piece of packing-cloth,\r\nstretched from the end of the shafts to two posts, served us for a\r\nroof. Dinarzade, with his sword awry after the manner of Frederic II.,\r\nstood between one of the wheels and a horse's crupper, telling a story\r\nto our great content. The canteen-women who brought us our rations\r\nstayed with us to listen to our Arab. The attentive group of bacchantes\r\nand Silenuses which formed the chorus accompanied the narrative with\r\nmarks of its surprise, approval, or disapproval.\r\n\r\n\"Gentlemen,\" said the story-teller, \"you all knew the Green Knight, who\r\nlived in the days of King John[105]?\"\r\n\r\nEvery one said:\r\n\r\n\"Yes, yes.\"\r\n\r\nDinarzade swallowed down a rolled pancake, burning himself as he did so.\r\n\r\n\"This Green Knight, gentlemen, as you know, since you have seen him,\r\nwas very good-looking: when the wind blew back his ruddy locks over\r\nhis casque, it looked like a twist of tow round a green turban.\"\r\n\r\nThe audience: \"Bravo!\"\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Dinarzade's tales.]\r\n\r\n\"One evening in May, he sounded his horn at the draw-bridge of a castle\r\nin Picardy, or Auvergne, no matter which. In that castle lived \"the\r\nLady of Great Companies.\" She welcomed the knight, told her servants\r\nto disarm him and lead him to the bath, and came and sat with him at a\r\nsplendid table; and the pages-in-waiting were mute.\"\r\n\r\nThe audience: \"Oh, oh!\"\r\n\r\n\"The lady, gentlemen, was tall, flat, lean, and shambling, like the\r\nmajor's wife; otherwise she had plenty of expression and an arch look.\r\nWhen she laughed and showed her long teeth beneath her stumpy nose, one\r\ndid not know what one was about. She fell in love with the knight and\r\nthe knight with her, although he was afraid of her.\"\r\n\r\nDinarzade emptied the ashes of his pipe on the rim of the wheel and\r\nwanted to refill his cutty; they made him continue: \"The Green Knight,\r\nutterly dumfoundered, resolved to leave the castle; but, before taking\r\nhis leave, he asked the lady of the keep for an explanation of many\r\nstrange things; at the same time he made her an offer of marriage,\r\nalways provided she was not a witch.\"\r\n\r\nDinarzade's rapier was planted stiff and straight between his knees.\r\nSeated and leaning forward with our pipes, we made a garland of\r\nfire-flakes beneath him, like Saturn's ring. Suddenly Dinarzade\r\nshouted, as though beside himself:\r\n\r\n\"Well, gentlemen, the Lady of Great Companies was Death!\"\r\n\r\nAnd the captain, breaking the ranks and shouting \"Death! Death!\" put\r\nthe canteen-women to flight. The meeting was closed: the uproar was\r\ngreat, the laughter prolonged. We approached Thionville amid the roar\r\nof the cannon of the place.\r\n\r\n*\r\n\r\nThe siege continued, or rather, there was no siege, for the trenches\r\nwere not opened, and troops were wanting to invest the place regularly.\r\nWe reckoned on receiving intelligence, and waited for news of the\r\nsuccesses of the Prussian Army or of Clerfayt's[106] Army, with which\r\nwas the French corps of the Duc de Bourbon. Our scanty supplies were\r\nbecoming exhausted; Paris seemed to draw farther away. The bad weather\r\nnever ceased; we were flooded in the midst of our works; I sometimes\r\nwoke in a trench with water up to my neck: the next day, I was a\r\ncripple.\r\n\r\nAmong my fellow-Bretons I had met Ferron de La Sigonnière[107], my old\r\nclass-fellow at Dinan. We slept badly under our tent; our heads went\r\nbeyond the canvas and received the rain from that sort of gutter. I\r\nwould get up and go with Ferron to walk in front of the stacked arms;\r\nfor all our evenings were not so gay as those with Dinarzade. We walked\r\nin silence, listening to the voices of the sentries, looking at the\r\nlights of our streets of tents as we had formerly watched the lamps\r\nin the passages at our college. We discussed the past and the future,\r\nthe mistakes that had been made, those that would still be made; we\r\ndeplored the blindness of our Princes, who imagined that they could\r\nreturn to their country with a handful of adherents and consolidate the\r\ncrown on their brother's head with the aid of the foreigner. I remember\r\nsaying to my friend, in the course of these conversations, that France\r\nwished to imitate England, that the King would perish on the scaffold,\r\nand that our expedition before Thionville would probably be one of the\r\nprincipal counts in the indictment of Louis XVI. Ferron was struck by\r\nmy prophecy: it was the first I ever made. Since that time, I have\r\nmade many others quite as true, quite as unheeded: when the accident\r\noccurred, the others took shelter and left me to struggle with the\r\nmisfortune which I had foreseen. When the Dutch encounter a squall\r\non the open sea, they retreat to the interior of the ship, close the\r\nhatches, and drink punch, leaving a dog on deck to bark at the storm;\r\nthe danger past, Trust is sent back to his kennel in the hold, and the\r\ncaptain returns to enjoy the fine weather on the quarter-deck. I have\r\nbeen the Dutch dog of the Legitimist ship.\r\n\r\nThe memories of my life as a soldier have engraved themselves upon\r\nmy thoughts; I have related them in the sixth book of the _Martyrs._\r\nArmorican barbarian in the Princes' camp as I was, I carried Homer with\r\nmy sword; I preferred \"my country, the poor, small isle of Aaron, to\r\nthe hundred cities of Crete.\" I said with Telemachus:\r\n\r\n\"The harsh country which only feeds goats is dearer to me than those in\r\nwhich horses are reared[108].\"\r\n\r\nMy words would have brought a smile to the lips of the warlike\r\nMenelaus: άγάθος Μενἐλαος.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe rumour spread that we were at last coming to action; the Prince of\r\nWaldeck was to attempt an assault while we were to cross the river and\r\nmake a diversion by a feint attack on the place from the French side.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: My company.]\r\n\r\nFive Breton companies, including mine, the company of the Picardy\r\nand Navarre officers, and the regiment of volunteers, composed of\r\nyoung Lorraine peasants and of deserters from various regiments, were\r\nordered up for duty. We were to be supported by the Royal Germans,\r\nthe squadrons of musketeers and the different corps of dragoons which\r\ncovered our left: my brother was with this cavalry with the Baron de\r\nMontboissier, who had married a daughter of M. de Malesherbes, sister\r\nto Madame de Rosanbo, and therefore aunt to my sister-in-law. We\r\nescorted three companies of Austrian artillery with heavy guns and a\r\nbattery of three mortars.\r\n\r\nWe started at six o'clock in the evening; at ten we crossed the\r\nMoselle, above Thionville, on a coppered pontoon bridge:\r\n\r\n                          Amæna fluenta\r\n    Subterlabentis tacito rumore Mosellæ[109].\r\n\r\nAt daybreak, we were drawn up in order of battle on the left bank, with\r\nthe heavy cavalry in echelons on both flanks, and the light cavalry\r\nin front. At our second movement, we formed in column and began to\r\ndefile. At about nine o'clock, we heard a volley fired on our left.\r\nA carabineer officer came dashing up at full speed to tell us that\r\na detachment of Kellermann's army was about to join issue with us,\r\nand that the action had already begun between the skirmishers. The\r\nofficer's horse had been struck by a bullet on the forehead; it reared,\r\nwith the foam streaming from its mouth and the blood from its nostrils:\r\nthe carabineer, seated sword in hand on this wounded horse, was superb.\r\nThe corps which had come out of Metz manœuvred to take us in flank:\r\nthey had field-pieces with them, whose fire reached our volunteer\r\nregiment. I heard the exclamations of some recruits struck by the\r\ncannon-balls; the last cries of youth snatched living from life gave me\r\na feeling of profound pity: I thought of the poor mothers.\r\n\r\nThe drums beat the charge, and we rushed in disorder upon the enemy.\r\nWe came so close that the smoke did not prevent us from seeing the\r\nterrible expression on the faces of men ready to shed your blood. The\r\npatriots had not yet acquired the assurance that comes from the long\r\nhabit of fighting and victory. Their movements were slack, they felt\r\ntheir way; fifty grenadiers of the Old Guard would have made head\r\nagainst an heterogeneous mass of undisciplined nobles, old and young:\r\nten to twelve hundred foot-soldiers were taken aback by a few gun-shots\r\nfrom the Austrian heavy artillery; they retreated; our cavalry pursued\r\nthem for two leagues.\r\n\r\nA deaf-and-dumb German girl, called Libbe, or Libba, had become\r\nattached to my cousin Armand and had followed him. I found her sitting\r\non the grass, which stained her dress with blood: her elbow rested\r\non her upturned knees; her hand, passed through her tangled yellow\r\ntresses, supported her head. She wept as she looked at three or four\r\nkilled men, new deaf-mutes, lying around her. She had not heard the\r\nclap of the thunderbolts of which she saw the effect, nor could she\r\nhear the sighs which escaped her lips when she looked at Armand; she\r\nhad never heard the sound of the voice of him she loved, and she would\r\nnot hear the first cry of the child she bore in her womb: if the grave\r\ncontained only silence, she would not know that she had sunk into it.\r\n\r\nFor that matter, fields of slaughter lie on every hand: in the Eastern\r\nCemetery[110] in Paris, twenty-seven thousand tombstones, two hundred\r\nand thirty thousand corpses, will show you the extent of the battle\r\nwhich death wages day and night at your doors.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The assault of Thionville.]\r\n\r\nAfter a somewhat long halt, we resumed our march, and arrived under the\r\nwalls of Thionville at nightfall. The drums did not beat; the word of\r\ncommand was given in a whisper. The cavalry, in order to repulse any\r\nsortie, stole along the roads and hedges to the gate which we were to\r\ncannonade. The Austrian artillery, protected by our infantry, took up\r\na position at fifty yards from the advanced works, behind a hastily\r\nthrown-up epaulement of gabions. At one o'clock on the morning of the\r\n1st of September, a rocket, sent up from the Prince of Waldeck's camp\r\non the other side of the place, gave the signal. The Prince commenced a\r\nsmart fire, to which the town made a vigorous reply. We began to fire\r\nforthwith.\r\n\r\nThe besieged, not thinking that we had troops on that side, and not\r\nforeseeing this assault, had left the southern ramparts unprotected; we\r\ndid not lose for waiting: the garrison armed a double battery, which\r\npenetrated our epaulements and dismounted two of our guns. The sky was\r\naflame; we were shrouded in torrents of smoke. I behaved like a little\r\nAlexander: weakened by fatigue, I fell sound asleep, almost under the\r\nwheels of the gun-carriage where I was on guard. A shell, bursting six\r\ninches off the ground, sent a splinter into my right thigh. I awoke\r\nwith the shock, but felt no pain, and perceived only by my blood that I\r\nwas wounded. I bound up my thigh with my hand-kerchief. In the affair\r\non the plain, two bullets had struck my knapsack during a wheeling\r\nmovement. _Atala_, like a devoted daughter, placed herself between her\r\nfather and the lead of the enemy: she had still to withstand the fire\r\nof the Abbé Morellet[111].\r\n\r\nAt four o'clock in the morning, the Prince of Waldeck's fire ceased: we\r\nthought the town had surrendered; but the gates were not opened, and we\r\nhad to think of retiring. We returned to our positions, after a tiring\r\nmarch of three days.\r\n\r\nThe Prince of Waldeck had gone as far as the edge of the ditches, which\r\nhe had tried to cross, hoping to bring about a surrender by means of\r\nthe simultaneous attack: divisions were still supposed to exist in the\r\ntown, and we flattered ourselves that the Royalist party would bring\r\nthe keys to the Princes. The Austrians, having fired in barbette, lost\r\na considerable number of men; the Prince of Waldeck had an arm shot\r\noff. While a few drops of blood flowed under the walls of Thionville,\r\nblood was flowing in torrents in the prisons of Paris: my wife and\r\nsisters were in greater danger than I.\r\n\r\n*\r\n\r\nWe raised the siege of Thionville and set out for Verdun, which had\r\nbeen restored to the Allies on the 2nd of September. Longwy, the\r\nbirthplace of François de Mercy[112], had fallen on the 23rd of August.\r\nWreaths and festoons of flowers bore evidence on every side of the\r\npassage of Frederic William. Among the peaceful trophies, I observed\r\nthe Prussian Eagle affixed to Vauban's[113] fortifications: it was\r\nnot to stay there long; as to the flowers, they were soon to see the\r\ninnocent creatures who had gathered them fade away like themselves. One\r\nof the most atrocious murders of the Terror was that of the young girls\r\nof Verdun.\r\n\r\n    \"Fourteen young girls of Verdun,\" says Riouffe[114], \"of\r\n    unexampled purity, who had the air of young virgins decked\r\n    for a public festival, were led together to the scaffold.\r\n    They disappeared suddenly and were gathered in their\r\n    springtime; the 'Court of Women,' on the morrow of their\r\n    death, looked like a garden-plot stripped of its flowers by a\r\n    storm. Never have I witnessed such despair as that which this\r\n    act of barbarity excited among us.\"\r\n\r\nVerdun is famous for its female sacrifices. According to Gregory of\r\nTours[115], Deuteric, to protect his daughter from the prosecution of\r\nTheodebert[116], placed her in a cart drawn by two untamed oxen and had\r\nher flung into the Meuse. The instigator of the massacre of the young\r\ngirls of Verdun was the regicide poetaster Pons de Verdun[117], who was\r\ninfuriated against his native city. The number of agents of the Terror\r\nsupplied by the _Almanach des Muses_ is incredible; the unsatisfied\r\nvanity of the mediocrities produced as many revolutionaries as the\r\nwounded pride of the cripples and abortions: a revolt analogous to\r\nthat of the infirmities of mind and body. Pons attached the point of a\r\ndagger to his blunt epigrams. Faithful, as it seemed, to the traditions\r\nof Greece, the poet was willing to offer none save the blood of virgins\r\nto his gods: for the Convention decreed, on his motion, that no woman\r\nwith child could be put on her trial. He also caused the sentence to\r\nbe annulled condemning Madame de Bonchamps to death, the widow of the\r\ncelebrated Vendean general[118]. Alas, we Royalists in the train of the\r\nPrinces attained the reverses of the Vendée without passing through its\r\nglory!\r\n\r\nWe had not at Verdun, to pass the time, \"that famous Comtesse de\r\nSaint-Balmont[119], who laid aside her female apparel, mounted\r\non horseback, and herself served as an escort to the ladies who\r\naccompanied her or whom she had left in her chariot...\" We had no\r\npassion for \"old Gallic,\" nor did we write \"notes in the language of\r\nAmadis[120].\"\r\n\r\nThe Prussian evil[121] communicated itself to our little army: I caught\r\nit. Our cavalry had gone to join Frederic William at Valmy. We knew\r\nnothing of what was happening, and were hourly expecting the order to\r\nmarch forward: we received the order to beat a retreat.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: I am weakened by my wound.]\r\n\r\nVery greatly weakened, and prevented by my troublesome wound from\r\nwalking without pain, I dragged myself as best I could in the wake of\r\nmy company, which soon dispersed. Jean Balue[122], son of a miller at\r\nVerdun, left his father's house at a very early age with a monk, who\r\nburdened him with his wallet. On leaving Verdun, \"Ford Hill\" according\r\nto Saumaise[123], _ver dunum_, I carried the wallet of the Monarchy,\r\nbut I did not become Comptroller of Finance, nor a bishop or cardinal.\r\n\r\nIf, in the novels which I have written, I have drawn upon my own\r\nhistory, in the histories which I have told I have placed memories of\r\nthe living history in which I took part. Thus, in my life of the Duc\r\nde Berry[124], I described some of the scenes which took place before\r\nmy eyes:\r\n\r\n    \"When an army is disbanded, it returns to its homes; but had\r\n    the soldiers of Condé's Army any homes? Whither was the stick\r\n    to lead them which they were hardly permitted to cut in the\r\n    forests of Germany, after laying down the musket which they\r\n    had taken up in defense of their King?...\r\n\r\n    \"The time had come to part. The brothers-in-arms bade each\r\n    other a last farewell, and took different roads on earth.\r\n    All, before setting out, went to salute their father and\r\n    captain, white-haired old Condé: the patriarch of glory gave\r\n    his blessing to his children, wept over his dispersed tribe,\r\n    and saw the tents of his camp fall with the grief of a man\r\n    witnessing the destruction of his ancestral roof[125].\"\r\n\r\n\r\nLess than twenty years later, the leader of the new French Army,\r\nBonaparte, also took leave of his companions: so quickly do men and\r\nempires pass, so little does the most extraordinary renown save one\r\nfrom the most common destiny!\r\n\r\nWe left Verdun. The rains had broken up the roads; everywhere one saw\r\nammunition-wagons, gun-carriages, cannon stuck in the mire, chariots\r\noverturned, cutler-women with their children on their backs, soldiers\r\ndying or dead in the mud. Crossing a ploughed field, I sank down to\r\nmy knees; Ferron and another comrade dragged me out despite myself: I\r\nbegged them to leave me there; I had rather died.\r\n\r\nOn the 16th of October, at the camp near Longwy, the captain of my\r\ncompany, M. de Goyon-Miniac, handed me a very honourable certificate.\r\nAt Arlon, we saw a file of wagons with their teams on the high-road:\r\nthe horses, some standing, others kneeling down, others with their\r\nnoses on the ground, were dead, and their bodies had grown stiff\r\nbetween the shafts: it was as though one saw the shades of a\r\nbattlefield bivouacking on the shores of Styx.\r\n\r\nFerron asked me what I meant to do, and I answered that, if I could go\r\nas far as Ostend, I would take ship for Jersey, where I should find my\r\nuncle de Bedée; from there I should be able to join the Royalists in\r\nBrittany.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: And catch the smallpox.]\r\n\r\nThe fever was sapping my strength; I could only with difficulty support\r\nmyself on my swollen thigh. I felt a new ailment lay hold of me. After\r\ntwenty-four hours' vomiting, my face and body were covered with an\r\neruption: confluent smallpox broke out; it appeared to be affected by\r\nthe temperature of the air. In this condition, I set out on foot to\r\nmake a journey of two hundred leagues, rich as I was to the extent\r\nof eighteen livres Tournois: all this for the greater glory of the\r\nMonarchy. Ferron, who had lent me my six small crowns of three francs,\r\nleft me, he having arranged to be met in Luxembourg.\r\n\r\n*\r\n\r\nAs I was leaving Arlon, a peasant took me up in his cart for the sum of\r\nfour sous, and put me down five leagues farther on a heap of stones. I\r\nhopped a few paces with the aid of my crutch, and washed the bandage\r\nround my scratch, which had developed into a sore, in a spring rustling\r\nby the roadside, which did me a great deal of good. The smallpox had\r\ncome quite out, and I felt relieved. I had not abandoned my knapsack,\r\nthe straps of which cut my shoulders.\r\n\r\nI spent that first night in a barn, and had nothing to eat. The wife\r\nof the farmer who owned the barn refused payment for my lodging. At\r\ndaybreak she brought me a great basin of coffee and milk, with a black\r\nloaf which I thought excellent. I resumed my road quite merrily,\r\nalthough I often fell. I was joined by four or five of my comrades,\r\nwho carried my knapsack; they were also very ill. We met villagers;\r\nby taking cart after cart we covered a sufficient distance in the\r\nArdennes, in five days, to reach Attert, Flamizoul, and Bellevue. On\r\nthe sixth day I found myself alone. My smallpox had grown paler and was\r\nless puffy.\r\n\r\nAfter walking two leagues, which took me six hours, I saw a gipsy\r\nfamily encamped behind a ditch around a furze fire, with two goats\r\nand a donkey. I had no sooner reached them than I let myself drop to\r\nthe ground, and the strange creatures hastened to succour me. A young\r\nwoman in rags, lively, dark, and mischievous, sang, leaped, skipped\r\naround, holding her child aslant upon her breast, as though it were a\r\nhurdy-gurdy with which she was enlivening her dance; she next squatted\r\non her heels close by my side, examined me curiously by the light of\r\nthe fire, took my dying hand to tell me my fortune, and asked me for \"a\r\nlittle sou:\" it was too dear. It would be difficult to possess more\r\nknowledge, charm, and wretchedness than my sybil of the Ardennes. I\r\ndo not know when the nomads, of whom I should have been a worthy son,\r\nleft me; they were not there when I woke from my torpor at dawn. My\r\nfortune-teller had gone away with the secret of my future. In exchange\r\nfor my \"little sou,\" she had laid by my head an apple which served to\r\nrefresh my mouth. I shook myself, like John Rabbit, among the \"thyme\"\r\nand the \"dew\"; but I was not able to \"browse,\" nor to \"trot,\" nor to\r\ncut many \"pranks[126].\" Nevertheless, I rose with the intention of\r\n\"paying my court to Aurora:\" she was very beautiful and I very ugly;\r\nher rosy face proclaimed her good health; she was better than the poor\r\nCephalus[127] of Armorica. Although both of us young, we were old\r\nfriends, and I imagined that her tears that morning were shed for me.\r\n\r\nI penetrated into the forest, feeling not too sad; solitude had\r\nrestored me to my own nature. I hummed the ballad by the ill-fated\r\nCazotte[128]:\r\n\r\n         Tout au beau milieu des Ardennes,\r\n    Est un château sur le haut d'un rocher[129].\r\n\r\nWas it not in the donjon of this ghostly castle that Philip II. King\r\nof Spain imprisoned my fellow-Breton, Captain La Noue[130], who had a\r\nChateaubriand for his grand-mother? Philip consented to release the\r\nillustrious prisoner if the latter consented to have his eyes put out;\r\nLa Noue was on the point of accepting the proposal, so great was his\r\nlonging to return to his dear Brittany. Alas! I was possessed with the\r\nsame desire, and to lose my sight I needed only the ailment with which\r\nit had pleased God to afflict me. I did not meet \"Sir Enguerrand coming\r\nfrom Spain[131],\" but poor wretches, small pedlars who, like myself,\r\ncarried their whole fortune on their back. A wood-cutter, with felt\r\nknee-caps, entered the woods: he should have taken me for a dead branch\r\nand cut me down. A few carrion crows, a few larks, a few buntings, a\r\nkind of large finches, hopped along the road or stood motionless on the\r\nborder of stones, watchful of the sparrow-hawk which hovered circling\r\nin the sky. From time to time, I heard the sound of the horn of the\r\nswine-herd watching his sows and their little ones acorning. I rested\r\nin a shepherd's movable hut; I found no one at home except Puss, who\r\nmade me a thousand graceful caresses. The shepherd was standing a long\r\nway off, in the centre of a common pasture, with his dogs sitting at\r\nirregular distances around the sheep; by day that herdsman gathered\r\nsimples: he was a doctor and a wizard; by night, he watched the stars:\r\nthen he was a Chaldean shepherd.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: A weary journey.]\r\n\r\nI stood still, half a league farther, in a pasturage of deer: hunters\r\nwent by at the other end. A spring murmured at my feet; at the bottom\r\nof this spring Orlando (Inamorato, not Furioso) saw a palace of crystal\r\nfilled with ladies and knights. If the paladin, who joined the dazzling\r\nwater-nymphs, had at least left Golden Bridle[132] at the brink of the\r\nwell; if Shakespeare had sent me Rosalind and the Exiled Duke[133],\r\nthey would have been very helpful to me.\r\n\r\nAfter taking breath I continued my road. My impaired ideas floated\r\nin a void that was not without charm; my old phantoms, having scarce\r\nthe consistency of shades three parts effaced, crowded round me to\r\nbid me farewell. I had no longer the power of memory; I beheld at\r\nan indeterminate distance the aerial forms of my relations and my\r\nfriends, mingled with unknown figures. When I sat down to rest against\r\na mile stone, I thought I saw faces smile to me in the threshold of\r\nthe distant cabins, in the blue smoke escaping from the roofs of the\r\ncottages, in the tree-tops, in the transparency of the clouds, in the\r\nluminous sheaves of the sun dragging its beams over the heather like a\r\ngolden rake. These apparitions were those of the Muses coming to assist\r\nthe poet's death: my tomb, dug with the uprights of their lyres under\r\nan oak of the Ardennes, would have fairly well suited the soldier and\r\nthe traveller. Some hazel-hens, which had strayed into the forms of\r\nthe hares under the privets, alone, with the insects, produced a few\r\nmurmurs around me: lives as slender, as unknown, as my life. I could\r\nwalk no farther; I felt extremely ill; the smallpox was turning in and\r\nchoking me.\r\n\r\nTowards the end of the day, I lay down on my back, in a ditch, with\r\nAtala's knapsack under my head, my crutch by my side, my eyes fixed\r\nupon the sun, whose light was going out with my own. I greeted in all\r\ngentleness of thought the luminary which had lighted my first youth on\r\nmy paternal moors: we retired to rest together, he to rise in greater\r\nglory, I, according to all appearances, never to wake again. I fainted\r\naway in a feeling of religion: the last sounds I heard were the fall of\r\na leaf and the whistling of a bullfinch.\r\n\r\n*\r\n\r\nIt seems that I lay unconscious for nearly two hours. The wagons of the\r\nPrince de Ligne[134] happened to pass; one of the drivers, stopping to\r\ncut a birch twig, stumbled over me without seeing me: he thought me\r\ndead and pushed me with his foot; I gave a sign of life. The driver\r\ncalled his comrades and, prompted by an instinct of pity, they threw\r\nme into a cart. The jolting revived me; I was able to talk to my\r\ndeliverers; I told them that I was a soldier of the Princes' Army, and\r\nthat if they would take me as far as Brussels, where I was going, I\r\nwould reward them for their trouble.\r\n\r\n\"All right, mate,\" said one of them, \"but you'll have to get down at\r\nNamur, for we're forbidden to carry anybody. We'll take you up again\r\nt'other side of the town.\"\r\n\r\nI asked for something to drink; I swallowed a few drops of brandy,\r\nwhich threw the symptoms of my disease out again and relieved my chest\r\nfor a moment: nature had endowed me with extraordinary strength.\r\n\r\nWe reached the suburbs of Namur at ten o'clock in the morning. I got\r\ndown and followed the waggons at a distance; I soon lost sight of\r\nthem. I was stopped at the entrance to the town. I sat down under the\r\ngateway, while my papers were being examined. The soldiers on guard,\r\nseeing my uniform, offered me a scrap of ammunition bread, and the\r\ncorporal handed me some peppered brandy in a blue glass drinking-cup.\r\nI made some ceremony about drinking out of the cup of military\r\nhospitality:\r\n\r\n\"Catch hold!\" he exclaimed angrily, accompanying his injunction with a\r\n_Sackerment der Teufel!_\r\n\r\nMy passage through Namur was a laborious one: I walked leaning against\r\nthe houses. The first woman who saw me left her shop, gave me her arm\r\nwith a pitying air, and helped me to drag myself along. I thanked her,\r\nand she replied:\r\n\r\n\"No, no, soldier,\"\r\n\r\nSoon other women came running up, bringing bread, wine, fruit, milk,\r\nsoup, old clothes, blankets.\r\n\r\n\"He is wounded,\" said some, in their Brabançon French dialect.\r\n\r\n\"He has the smallpox,\" cried others, and kept back their children.\r\n\r\n\"But, young man, you will not be able to walk; you will die if you do;\r\nstay in the hospital.\"\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The women of Namur.]\r\n\r\nThey wanted to take me to the hospital, they relieved each other from\r\ndoor to door, and in this way helped me to the gate of the town,\r\noutside which I found the wagons again. You have seen a peasant-woman\r\nsuccour me; you shall see another woman show me hospitality in\r\nGuernsey. Women who have aided me in my distress, if you be still\r\nliving, may God help you in your old age and in your sorrows! If you\r\nhave departed this life, may your children share the happiness which\r\nHeaven has long refused me!\r\n\r\nThe women of Namur assisted me to climb into the wagon, recommended me\r\nto the driver's care, and compelled me to accept a woollen blanket.\r\nI noticed that they treated me with a sort of respect and deference:\r\nthere is something superior, something delicate, in the nature of\r\nFrenchmen which other nations recognise.\r\n\r\nThe Prince de Ligne's men put me down for the second time on the road\r\njust outside Brussels, and refused to accept my last crown-piece. In\r\nBrussels, not one inn-keeper was willing to take me in. The wandering\r\nJew, the popular Orestes, whom the ballad represents as going to that\r\ntown:\r\n\r\n    Quand il fut dans la ville\r\n    De Bruxelle en Brabant[135],\r\n\r\nmet with a better reception than I, for he had always five sous in his\r\npocket. I knocked: they opened; when they saw me they said, \"Move on,\r\nmove on!\" and shut the door in my face. I was driven out of a café. My\r\nhair hung over my face, hidden behind my beard and mustachios; I had a\r\nhay bandage round my thigh; over my tattered uniform I wore the blanket\r\nof the Namur women, knotted round my throat by way of a cloak. The\r\nbeggar in the _Odyssey_ was more insolent, but not so poor as I.\r\n\r\nI had at first presented myself to no purpose at the hotel where I had\r\nstayed with my brother: I made a second attempt; as I approached the\r\ndoor I saw the Comte de Chateaubriand stepping from a carriage with\r\nthe Baron de Montboissier. He was alarmed at my spectral appearance.\r\nThey looked for a room outside the hotel, for the proprietor absolutely\r\nrefused to admit me. A wig-maker offered me a den suited to my\r\nwretchedness. My brother brought me a surgeon and a doctor. He had\r\nreceived letters from Paris: M. de Malesherbes invited him to return\r\nto France. He told me of the day's work of the 10th of August, the\r\nmassacres of September, and the political news, of which I knew not\r\na word. He approved of my plan to cross to Jersey, and advanced me\r\ntwenty-five louis. My impaired sight hardly permitted me to distinguish\r\nmy brother's features; I believed that that gloom emanated from myself,\r\nwhereas it was the shadow which Eternity was spreading around him:\r\nwithout knowing it, we were seeing each other for the last time. All of\r\nus, such as we are, have only the present moment for our own: the next\r\nbelongs to God; there are always two chances of not seeing again the\r\nfriend who is leaving us: our death and his. How many men have never\r\nreclimbed the staircase they have descended!\r\n\r\nDeath touches us more before than after the decease of a friend:\r\nit is a piece of ourselves that is torn away, a world of childish\r\nrecollections, of familiar intimacy, of affections and interests in\r\ncommon, that dissolves. My brother preceded me in my mother's womb; he\r\nwas the first to dwell in those same sainted entrails whence I issued\r\nafter him; he sat before me by the paternal hearth; he waited several\r\nyears to welcome me, to give me my name in the Name of Jesus Christ,\r\nand to ally himself with the whole of my youth. My blood, mingled with\r\nhis blood in the revolutionary receptacle, would have had the same\r\nsavour, like a draught of milk supplied by the pasturage of the same\r\nmountain. But, if men caused the head of my elder, my god-father,\r\nto fall before its time, the years will not spare mine; already my\r\nforehead is shedding its covering; I feel an Ugolino, Time, stooping\r\nover me and gnawing at my skull:\r\n\r\n    ... come'l pan perf ame si manduca[136].\r\n\r\nThe doctor could not recover from his astonishment: he looked upon\r\nthat which did not kill me, which came to none of its natural crises,\r\nas a phenomenon unprecedented in the history of medicine. Gangrene had\r\nset in in my wound; they dressed it with quinine. Having obtained this\r\nfirst aid, I insisted on departing for Ostend. Brussels was hateful to\r\nme, I burned to leave it; it was once again filling with those heroes\r\nof domesticity who had returned from Verdun in their carriages, and\r\nwhom I did not see in Brussels when I accompanied the King there during\r\nthe Hundred Days.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: I reached Guernsey.]\r\n\r\nI travelled pleasantly to Ostend by the canals: I found some Bretons\r\nthere, my comrades-in-arms. We chartered a decked barge and went down\r\nthe Channel. We slept in the hold, on the shingle which served as\r\nballast. The strength of my constitution was at last exhausted. I could\r\nno longer speak; the motion of a rough sea broke me down completely.\r\nI swallowed scarce a few drops of water and lemon, and, when the bad\r\nweather compelled us to put in to Guernsey, they thought I was going to\r\nbreathe my last: an emigrant priest read me the prayers for the dying.\r\nThe captain, not wishing to have me die on board his ship, ordered me\r\nto be put down on the quay; they set me down in the sun, with my back\r\nleaning against a wall, and my head turned towards the open sea, facing\r\nthat Isle of Alderney where, eight months before, I had beheld death in\r\nanother shape.\r\n\r\nIt would seem that I was vowed to pity. The wife of an English pilot\r\nhappened to pass by; she was moved and called her husband, who,\r\nassisted by two or three sailors, carried me into a fisherman's house:\r\nme, the friend of the waves; they laid me on a comfortable bed, between\r\nvery white sheets. The young barge-woman took every possible care of\r\nthe stranger: I owe her my life. The next day I was taken on board\r\nagain. My hostess almost wept on taking leave of her patient: women\r\nhave a heaven-born instinct for misfortune. My fair-haired and comely\r\nguardian, who resembled a figure in the old English prints, pressed\r\nmy bloated and burning hands between her own, so cool and long; I was\r\nashamed to touch anything so charming with anything so unseemly.\r\n\r\nWe set sail and reached the westernmost point of Jersey. One of my\r\ncompanions, M. du Tilleul, went to St. Helier's to my uncle. M. de\r\nBedée sent a carriage to fetch me the next morning. We drove across the\r\nentire island: dying as I was, I was charmed with its groves; but I\r\nonly talked nonsense about them, having fallen into a delirium.\r\n\r\nI lay four months between life and death. My uncle, his wife, his son\r\nand his three daughters took it in turns to watch by my bedside. I\r\noccupied an apartment in one of the houses which they were beginning to\r\nbuild along the harbour: the windows of my room came down to the level\r\nof the floor, and I was able to see the sea from my bed. The doctor,\r\nM. Delattre, had forbidden them to talk to me of serious things, and\r\nespecially of politics. Towards the end of January 1793, seeing my\r\nuncle enter my room in deep mourning, I trembled, for I thought we had\r\nlost one of our family: he informed me of the death of Louis XVI. I was\r\nnot surprised: I had foreseen it. I asked for news of my relatives:\r\nmy sisters and my wife had returned to Brittany after the September\r\nmassacres; they had had great difficulty in leaving Paris. My brother\r\nhad gone back to France, and was living at Malesherbes. I began to get\r\nup; the smallpox was gone; but I suffered with my chest, and a weakness\r\nremained which I long retained.\r\n\r\nJersey, the Cæsarea of the Itinerary of Antoninus[137], has remained\r\nsubject to the Crown of England since the death of Robert, Duke\r\nof Normandy[138]; we have often tried to capture it, but always\r\nunsuccessfully. The island is a remnant of our early history: the\r\nsaints coming to Brittany-Armorica from Hibernia and Albion rested at\r\nJersey. St. Hélier[139], a solitary, dwelt in the rocks of Cæsarea; he\r\nwas butchered by the Vandals. In Jersey, one finds a specimen of the\r\nold Normans; it is as though one heard William the Bastard[140] speak,\r\nor the author of the _Roman du Rou._\r\n\r\nThe island is fertile: it has two towns and twelve parishes; it is\r\ncovered with country-houses and herds of cattle. The ocean wind, which\r\nseems to belie its rudeness, gives Jersey exquisite honey, cream\r\nof extraordinary sweetness, and butter deep-yellow in colour and\r\nviolet-scented. Bernardin de Saint-Pierre conjectures that the apple\r\ncame to us from Jersey; he is mistaken: we have the apple and the pear\r\nfrom Greece, as we owe the peach to Persia, the lemon to Media, the\r\nplum to Syria, the cherry to Cerasus, the chestnut to Castanea, the\r\nquince to Canea, and the pomegranate to Cyprus.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: And Jersey.]\r\n\r\nI took great pleasure in going out in the early days of May. Spring in\r\nJersey preserves all her youth; she might still be called by her former\r\nname of Primavera, a name which, as she grew older, it left to her\r\ndaughter, the first flower with which it crowns itself.\r\n\r\n*\r\n\r\nHere I will copy for you two pages from the Life of the Duc de Berry;\r\nit is as though I told you my own:\r\n\r\n    \"After twenty-two years of fighting, the brazen barrier with\r\n    which France was girt about was forced: the hour of the\r\n    Restoration drew nigh; our Princes left their retreats. Each\r\n    of them made for a different point of the frontier, like\r\n    travellers who, at the risk of their lives, seek to penetrate\r\n    into a country of which marvels are related. Monsieur set out\r\n    for Switzerland; Monseigneur le Duc d'Angoulême for Spain,\r\n    and his brother for Jersey. In that island, in which some of\r\n    the judges of Charles I. died unknown to their fellow-men,\r\n    Monseigneur le Duc de Berry found French Royalists grown old\r\n    in exile and forgotten for their virtues, as in former days\r\n    the English regicides for their crime. He met old priests,\r\n    henceforth consecrated to solitude; he realized with them the\r\n    fiction of the poet who makes a Bourbon land on the island\r\n    of Jersey after a storm. One of these confessors and martyrs\r\n    might say to the heir of Henry IV., as the hermit of Jersey\r\n    said to that great king:\r\n\r\n     Loin de la cour alors, dans cette grotte obscure\r\n     De ma religion je viens pleurer l'injure[141].\r\n\r\n\"Monseigneur le Duc de Berry spent some months in Jersey; the sea, the\r\nwinds, politics bound him there. Everything opposed his impatience; he\r\nfound himself on the point of renouncing his enterprise and taking ship\r\nfor Bordeaux. A letter from him to Madame la Maréchale Moreau gives us\r\na vivid idea of his occupations on his rock:\r\n\r\n    \"'8 _February_ 1814.\r\n\r\n    \"'Here I am like Tantalus, in sight of that unhappy France\r\n    which finds so much difficulty in breaking its chains.\r\n    You whose soul is so beautiful, so French, can judge of\r\n    my feelings; how much it would cost me to move away from\r\n    that shore which I should need but two hours to reach!\r\n    When the sun lights it, I climb the tallest rocks and,\r\n    with my spy-glass in my hand, I follow the whole coast:\r\n    I can see the rocks of Coutances. My imagination rises,\r\n    I see myself leaping on shore, surrounded by Frenchmen,\r\n    wearing the white cockade in their hats; I hear the cry of\r\n    'Long live the King!' that cry which no Frenchman has ever\r\n    heard with composure; the loveliest woman of the province\r\n    girds me with a white sash, for love and glory always go\r\n    together. We march on Cherbourg; some rascally fort, with a\r\n    garrison of foreigners, tries to defend itself: we carry it\r\n    by assault, and a vessel puts out to fetch the King, with\r\n    the White Ensign which recalls the days of France's glory\r\n    and happiness! Ah, madame, when removed by but a few hours\r\n    from so likely a dream, can one think of betaking himself\r\n    elsewhere!'\"\r\n\r\n*\r\n\r\nIt is three years since I wrote these pages in Paris; I had gone before\r\nM. le Duc de Berry in Jersey, the city of the exiled, by twenty-two\r\nyears; I was to leave my name behind me, since Armand de Chateaubriand\r\nwas married, and his son Frédéric born there[142].\r\n\r\nGaiety had not abandoned the family of my uncle de Bedée; my aunt\r\ncontinued to nurse a big dog, descended from the one whose virtues I\r\nhave related: as it bit everybody and had the mange, my cousins had\r\nit secretly hanged, notwithstanding its nobility. Madame de Bedée\r\npersuaded herself that some English officers, charmed with Azor's\r\nbeauty, had stolen it, and that it was living, laden with honours and\r\ndinners, in the richest castle of the Three Kingdoms. Alas, our present\r\nhilarity was compounded only out of our past gaiety! By recalling the\r\nscenes at Monchoix we found means of laughter in Jersey. The case is\r\nrare enough, for in the human heart pleasures do not keep up the same\r\nrelations one to the other that sorrows do: new joys do not restore\r\ntheir springtime to former joys, but recent sorrows cause old sorrows\r\nto blossom over again.\r\n\r\nFor the rest, the Emigrants at that time excited general sympathy;\r\nour cause appeared to be the cause of European order: an honoured\r\nunhappiness, such as ours, is something.\r\n\r\nM. de Bouillon[143] was the protector of the French refugees in Jersey:\r\nhe dissuaded me from my plan of crossing over to Brittany, unfit as\r\nI was to endure a life of caves and forests; he advised me to go\r\nto England, and there seek the opportunity of entering the regular\r\nservice. My uncle, who was very ill provided with money, began to feel\r\nstraitened with his large family; he had found himself obliged to send\r\nhis son to London to feed himself on starvation and hope. Fearing lest\r\nI should be a burden to M. de Bedée, I decided to relieve him of my\r\npresence.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: I set sail for England.]\r\n\r\nThirty louis, which a Saint-Malo smuggler brought me, enabled me to\r\nput my plan into execution, and I booked a berth on the packet for\r\nSouthampton. I was deeply touched, on bidding farewell to my uncle: he\r\nhad nursed me with the affection of a father; with him were connected\r\nthe few happy moments of my childhood; he knew all I loved; I found\r\nin his features a certain resemblance to my mother. I had left that\r\nexcellent mother, and was never to see her again; I had left my sister\r\nJulie and my brother, and was doomed to meet them no more; I was\r\nleaving my uncle, and his genial countenance was never again to gladden\r\nmy eyes. A few months had sufficed to bring all these losses, for the\r\ndeath of our friends is not reckoned from the moment at which they die,\r\nbut from that at which we cease to live with them.\r\n\r\nWere it possible to say to Time, \"Not so fast!\" one would stop it at\r\nthe hours of delight; but, as this is not possible, let us not linger\r\nhere below; let us go away before witnessing the flight of friends\r\nand of those years which the poet considers alone worthy of life:\r\n_Vitâ dignior ætas._ That which delights us in the age of friendships\r\nbecomes an object of suffering and regret in the age of destitution.\r\nWe no longer desire the return of the smiling months to the earth;\r\nwe dread it rather: the birds, the flowers, a fine evening at the\r\nend of April, a fine night commencing in the evening with the first\r\nnightingale and ending in the morning with the first swallow, those\r\nthings which give the need and longing for happiness kill one. You\r\nstill feel their charms, but they are no longer for you: youth which\r\ntastes them by your side, and which looks down upon you with scorn,\r\nfills you with jealousy and makes you realize the completeness of your\r\ndesolation. The grace and freshness of nature, while recalling your\r\npast happiness, adds to the unsightliness of your misery. You have\r\nbecome a mere blot upon that nature; you spoil its harmony and its\r\nsuavity by your presence, by your words, and even by the sentiments\r\nwhich you venture to express. You may love, but you can no longer be\r\nloved. The vernal fountain has renewed its waters without restoring\r\nyour youth to you, and the sight of all that is born again, of all that\r\nis happy, reduces you to the sorrowful remembrance of your pleasures.\r\n\r\n*\r\n\r\nThe packet on which I embarked was crowded with Emigrant families.\r\nI there made the acquaintance of M. Hingant[144], an old colleague\r\nof my brother's in the Parliament of Brittany, a man of taste and\r\nintelligence, of whom I shall have much to say. A naval officer was\r\nplaying chess in the captain's room; he did not recollect my features,\r\nso greatly was I changed; but I recognised Gesril. We had not met\r\nsince Brest; we were destined to part at Southampton. I told him of\r\nmy travels, he told me of his. This young man, born near me among the\r\nwaves, embraced his first friend for the last time in the midst of the\r\nwaves which were about to witness his glorious death. Lamba Doria[145],\r\nadmiral of the Genoese, after beating the Venetian fleet, learnt that\r\nhis son had been killed:\r\n\r\n\"Bury him in the sea,\" said this Roman father, as though he had said,\r\n\"Bury him in his victory.\"\r\n\r\nGesril voluntarily left the billows into which he had flung himself\r\nonly the better to show them his \"victory\" on shore.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: And land at Southampton.]\r\n\r\nI gave the certificate of my landing from Jersey at Southampton at the\r\ncommencement of the sixth book of these Memoirs. Behold me, therefore,\r\nafter my travels in the forests of America and the camps of Germany,\r\narriving, as a poor Emigrant, in 1793, in the land in which I am\r\nwriting all this in 1822, and in which I am living to-day a splendid\r\nambassador.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[1] This book was written in London between April and September 1822,\r\nand revised in February 1845 and December 1846.--T.\r\n\r\n[2] Georges Jacques Danton (1759-1794), perhaps the least contemptible\r\nof the demagogues of the time.--T.\r\n\r\n[3] The National or Constituent Assembly passed the Constitution on\r\nthe 3rd of September 1791, the King accepting it on the 13th. This\r\nConstitution created a Legislative Assembly, which alone was to retain\r\nthe power of making laws, subject to the veto of the Sovereign. On\r\nthe 30th of September the Constituent Assembly was dissolved and\r\nimmediately succeeded by the Legislative Assembly, which consisted of\r\n745 deputies elected by the people, and sat from 1 October 1791 to\r\n21 September 1792. It was in this assembly that the parties of the\r\nMountain and the Gironde were formed.--T.\r\n\r\n[4] Jean Claude Marin Victor Marquis de Laqueville (1742-1810)\r\ncommanded the corps of the nobles of Auvergne under the Comte d'Artois.\r\nHe was impeached on the 1st of January 1792.

In 1788 he\r\npublished his _Voyage du jeune Anacharsis en Grèce vers le milieu du\r\nIVe. siècle avant l'ère vulgaire_, which made his name.

His\r\ntranslations in verse of the _Metamorphoses_ and other of Ovid's works\r\nare of great merit; but he appears to have been cursed with inordinate\r\nvanity, in addition to the stupidity of which Chateaubriand speaks.--T.\r\n\r\n[16] Jacques Henri Bernardin de Saint-Pierre (1737-1814), the famous\r\nauthor of the _Études de la nature_ and of _Paul et Virginie._ He\r\npreached virtue in all his works; his personal character and conduct\r\nwere far from being irreproachable.--T.\r\n\r\n[17] 30 January 1791.--B.\r\n\r\n[18]\r\n\r\n\"D'Egmont with Love one day this bank her presence gave;\r\nFor a moment the water stained\r\nWith the image of her beauty upon the fleeting wave:\r\nThen D'Egmont disappeared; and Love alone remained.--T.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n[19] By Carbon de Flins des Oliviers.--T.\r\n\r\n[20]\r\n\r\n    \"Our brave defenders' warlike zeal\r\n    Wakes pride within my breast,\r\n    But when through gore the people reel,\r\n    Their fury I detest.\r\n    Let Europe of us dwell in fear,\r\n    Let us live ever free,\r\n    But Gallic wit our lives shall cheer,\r\n    And amiability.\"--T.\r\n\r\n\r\n[21] Anne Joseph Terwagne, Demoiselle Théroigne de Méricourt\r\n(1762-1817), a formidable virago of the Revolution.

Having voted,\r\nhowever, at the trial of Louis XVI. for \"death with delay and appeal to\r\nthe people,\" he became odious to the revolutionaries and was proscribed\r\nwith the Girondins, 31 May 1793. He fled and perished in the Bordeaux\r\nmarshes, where his body was half eaten by wolves.--T.\r\n\r\n[25] Before 1789, Paris was divided into 21 quarters.

This society invited me to its\r\nannual meeting[147]; I made it my duty to attend and to present my\r\nsubscription[148]. H.R.H. the Duke of York[149] occupied the chair; on\r\nhis right were the Duke of Somerset[150] and Lords Torrington[151] and\r\nBolton[152]; I myself sat on his left. I met my friend Mr. Canning[153]\r\nthere. The poet, orator, and illustrious minister made a speech in\r\nwhich occurred the following passage, which did me too great honour,\r\nand which was reported in the newspapers:\r\n\r\n\"Although the person of my noble friend, the Ambassador of France, is\r\nas yet but little known here, his character and writings are well known\r\nto all Europe. He began his career by expounding the principles of\r\nChristianity, and continued it by defending those of monarchy; and now\r\nhe comes amongst us to unite the two countries by the common bonds of\r\nmonarchical principles and Christian virtues[154].\"\r\n\r\n*\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The literary fund.]\r\n\r\nIt is many years since Mr. Canning, the man of letters, improved\r\nhimself by the political lessons of Mr. Pitt[155]; it is almost the\r\nsame number of years since I began obscurely to write in that same\r\nEnglish capital. Both of us have attained high station and are now\r\nmembers of a society devoted to the relief of unfortunate authors. Is\r\nit the affinity of our grandeurs or the relation of our sufferings\r\nthat brought us together in this place? What should the Governor of\r\nthe East Indies and the French Ambassador be doing at the banquet\r\nof the afflicted muses? It was rather George Canning and François\r\nde Chateaubriand who sat down to it, in remembrance of their former\r\nadversity and perhaps of their former happiness: they drank to the\r\nmemory of Homer singing his verses for a morsel of bread.\r\n\r\n\r\nIf the Literary Fund had existed when I arrived in London from\r\nSouthampton on the 21st of May 1793, it would perhaps have paid a\r\ndoctor's visit to the garret in Holborn in which my cousin de La\r\nBoüétardais[156], son of my uncle de Bedée, harboured me. It had been\r\nhoped that the change of air would do marvels towards restoring to me\r\nthe strength essential to a soldier's life; but my health, instead of\r\nrecovering, declined. My chest became involved; I was thin and pale,\r\nI coughed frequently, I breathed with difficulty; I had attacks of\r\nperspiration and I spat blood. My friends, who were as poor as I,\r\ndragged me from doctor to doctor. These Hippocrates kept the band of\r\nbeggars waiting at their door, and then told me, for the price of one\r\nguinea, that I must bear my complaint patiently, adding:\r\n\r\n\"That's all, my dear sir.\"\r\n\r\nDr. Goodwyn[157], famous for his experiments relating to drowning\r\npeople, made on his own person by his own prescriptions, was more\r\ngenerous: he assisted me with his advice gratis; but he said to me,\r\nwith the harshness which he employed towards himself, that I might\r\n\"last\" a few months, perhaps one or two years, provided I gave up all\r\nfatigue.\r\n\r\n\"Do not look forward to a long career:\" that was the substance of his\r\nconsultations.\r\n\r\nThe certainty of my approaching end thus acquired, while increasing the\r\nnatural gloom of my imagination, gave me an incredible peace of mind.\r\nThis inner disposition explains a passage of the note placed at the\r\nhead of the _Essai historique_[158], as well as the following passage\r\nfrom the _Essai_ itself:\r\n\r\n    \"Smitten as I am with an illness which leaves me little hope,\r\n    I behold objects with a tranquil eye; the calm atmosphere of\r\n    the tomb is perceptible to the traveller who is but a few\r\n    days' march removed from it[159].\"\r\n\r\nThe bitterness of the reflections spread over the _Essai_ will\r\ntherefore arouse no astonishment: I wrote that work while lying under\r\nsentence of death, between the verdict and the execution. A writer who\r\nbelieved himself to be drawing near his end, amid the destitution of\r\nhis exile, could scarcely cast a smiling glance upon the world.\r\n\r\nBut how to spend the days of grace that had been granted me? I might\r\nhave lived or died promptly by my sword: I was forbidden to use it.\r\nWhat remained? A pen? It was neither known nor proved, and I was\r\nignorant of its power. Would my innate taste for letters, the poems of\r\nmy childhood, the sketches of my travels suffice to attract the public\r\nattention? The idea of writing a work on the comparative Revolutions\r\nhad occurred to me; I turned it over in my mind as a subject more\r\nsuited to the interests of the day; but who would undertake the\r\nprinting of a manuscript with none to extol its merits, and who would\r\nsupport me during the composition of that manuscript? Even if I had\r\nbut a few days to spend on earth, I must nevertheless have some means\r\nof support for those few days. My thirty louis, already seriously\r\ncurtailed, could not go very far, and, in addition to my own distress,\r\nI had to support the general distress of the Emigration. My companions\r\nin London all had occupations: some had embarked in the coal trade,\r\nothers with their wives made straw hats, others again taught the French\r\nwhich they did not know. They were all merry. The fault of our nation,\r\nits frivolity, had at that moment changed into virtue. They laughed in\r\nFortune's face: that thieving wench was quite abashed at carrying off\r\nsomething which she was not asked to restore.\r\n\r\n*\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Peltier.]\r\n\r\nPeltier, author of the _Domine salvum fac regem_[160] and principal\r\neditor of the _Actes des Apôtres_, continued his Parisian enterprise in\r\nLondon. He was not precisely vicious: but he was devoured by a vermin\r\nof small faults of which it was impossible to purify him; he was a\r\nrake, a good-for-nothing, earned a great deal of money and spent it as\r\nlavishly, was at the same time the adherent of the Legitimacy and the\r\nambassador of the black King Christophe[161] to George III., diplomatic\r\ncorrespondent of M. le Comte de \"Limonade,\" and drank up in champagne\r\nthe salary which was paid him in sugar[162]. This sort of M. Violet\r\nplaying the grand airs of the Revolution on a pocket violin came to see\r\nme, and offered his services as a Breton. I spoke to him of my plan of\r\nthe _Essai_; he loudly approved of it:\r\n\r\n\"It will be superb!\" he exclaimed, and offered me a room in the house\r\nof his printer, Baylis, who would print the work piece by piece as I\r\nwrote it.\r\n\r\nDeboffe the bookseller should have the sale of it; he, Peltier, would\r\ntrumpet it in his paper, the _Ambigu_, while one might obtain a footing\r\nin the London _Courrier français_, the editorship of which was soon to\r\nbe transferred to M. de Montlosier[163]. Peltier never entertained a\r\ndoubt: he spoke of getting me the Cross of St. Louis for my siege of\r\nThionville. My Gil Blas, tall, lean, lanky, with powdered hair and a\r\nbald forehead, always shouting and joking, put his round hat on one\r\near, took me by the arm, and carried me off to Baylis the printer,\r\nwhere, without any ceremony, he hired a room for me at a guinea a month.\r\n\r\nI was face to face with my golden future; but how to bridge over the\r\npresent? Peltier obtained translations from the Latin and the English\r\nfor me; I worked at translating by day, and at night at the _Essai\r\nhistorique_, into which I introduced a portion of my travels and my\r\nday-dreams. Baylis supplied me with the books, and I laid out a few\r\nshillings to ill purpose on the purchase of old volumes displayed on\r\nthe bookstalls.\r\n\r\nHingant, whom I had met on the Jersey packet, had become intimate\r\nwith me. He cultivated literature, he was well informed, and he wrote\r\nnovels in secret and read me pages of them. He had a lodging not far\r\nfrom Baylis, at the end of a street leading into Holborn. I breakfasted\r\nwith him every morning at ten o'clock; we talked about politics\r\nand above all about my work. I told him how much I had built of my\r\nnocturnal edifice, the _Essai_; then I reverted to my labour of the\r\ndaytime, the translations. We met for dinner, at a shilling a head, in\r\na public-house; thence we made for the fields. Often also we walked\r\nalone, for we were both of us fond of musing.\r\n\r\nI would then direct my steps towards Kensington or Westminster.\r\nKensington pleased me; I wandered about its solitary part, while the\r\npart adjacent to Hyde Park became filled with a brilliant multitude.\r\nThe contrast between my penury and the display of wealth, between my\r\ndestitution and the crowd, was pleasant to me. I watched the young\r\nEnglishwomen pass in the distance with that sense of desirous confusion\r\nwhich my sylph had formerly caused me to feel when, after decking\r\nher with all my extravagances, I scarce dared lift my eyes upon my\r\nhandiwork. Death, which I thought that I was approaching, added a\r\nmystery to this vision of a world from which I had almost departed. Did\r\never a look rest upon the foreigner seated at the foot of a fir-tree?\r\nDid some fair woman divine the invisible presence of René?\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: A night in Westminster Abbey.]\r\n\r\nAt Westminster I found a different pastime: in that labyrinth of tombs\r\nI thought of mine ready to open. The bust of an unknown man like myself\r\nwould never find a place amid those illustrious effigies! Then appeared\r\nthe sepulchres of the monarchs: Cromwell[164] was there no longer,\r\nand Charles I.[165] was not there. The ashes of a traitor, Robert of\r\nArtois[166], lay beneath the flagstones which I trod with my loyal\r\nsteps. The fate of Charles I. had just been extended to Louis XVI.; the\r\nsteel was reaping its daily harvest in France, and the graves of my\r\nkindred were already dug.\r\n\r\nThe singing of the choir and the conversation of the visitors\r\ninterrupted my reflections. I was not able often to repeat my visits,\r\nfor I was obliged to give to the guardians of those who lived no more\r\nthe shilling which was necessary to me to live. But then I would turn\r\nround and round outside the abbey with the rooks, or stop to gaze at\r\nthe steeples, twins of unequal height, which the setting sun stained\r\nred with its fiery light against the black hangings of the smoke of the\r\nCity.\r\n\r\nOne day, however, it happened that, wishing towards evening to\r\ncontemplate the interior of the basilica, I became lost in admiration\r\nof its spirited and capricious architecture. Dominated by the sentiment\r\nof the \"dowdy vastitie of our churches[167],\" I wandered with slow\r\nfootsteps and became benighted: the doors were closed. I tried to find\r\nan outlet; I called the usher, I knocked against the doors: all the\r\nnoise I made, spread and spun out in the silence, was lost; I had to\r\nresign myself to sleeping among the dead.\r\n\r\nAfter hesitating in my choice of a resting-place I stopped near Lord\r\nChatham's[168] mausoleum, at the foot of the rood and of the double\r\nstair of Henry the Seventh's and the Knights' Chapel. At the entrance\r\nto those stairs, to those aisles enclosed with railings, a sarcophagus\r\nbuilt into the wall, opposite to a marble figure of death armed with\r\nits scythe, offered me its shelter. The fold of a winding-sheet, also\r\nof marble, served me for a niche: following the example of Charles\r\nV.[169], I inured myself to my burial. I was in the best seats for\r\nseeing the world as it is. What a mass of greatnesses were confined\r\nbeneath those vaults! What remains of them? Afflictions are no less\r\nvain than felicities: the hapless Jane Grey[170] is not different\r\nfrom the blithe Alice of Salisbury[171] save that the skeleton is\r\nless horrible because it has no head; her body is beautified by her\r\npunishment and by the absence of that which constituted its beauty.\r\nThe tournaments of the victor of Crecy[172], the sports of the Field\r\nof the Cloth of Gold of Henry VIII.[173] will not be renewed in that\r\ntheatre of funereal spectacles. Bacon[174], Newton[175], Milton[176]\r\nare interred as deeply, have passed away as completely, as their more\r\nobscure contemporaries. Should I, an exile, a vagabond, a pauper,\r\nconsent to be no longer the petty, forgotten, sorrowful thing that I am\r\nin order to have been one of those famous, mighty, pleasure-sated dead?\r\nAh, life is not all that! If from the shores of this world we cannot\r\ndistinctly discern matters divine, let us not be astonished: time is a\r\nveil set between ourselves and God, even as our eyelids are interposed\r\nbetween our eyes and the light.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Reflections and release.]\r\n\r\nCrouching under my marble sheet, I descended from these lofty thoughts\r\nto the simple impressions of the place and moment. My anxiety mingled\r\nwith pleasure was analogous to that which I used to experience in\r\nwinter in my turret at Combourg, as I listened to the wind: a breeze\r\nand a shadow possess a kindred nature. Little by little I grew\r\naccustomed to the darkness and distinguished the figures placed over\r\nthe tombs. I looked up at the vaults of this English Saint-Denis,\r\nwhence one might say that the years that have been and the issues of\r\nthe past hung down like Gothic lamps: the entire edifice was as it were\r\na monolithic temple of ages turned to stone.\r\n\r\nI had counted ten o'clock, eleven o'clock by the abbey clock: the\r\nhammer rising and falling upon the bell-metal was the only living\r\ncreature in those regions beside myself. Outside, the sound of a\r\ncarriage, the voice of the watchman: that was all; those distant sounds\r\nof earth reached me as though from one world to another. The fog from\r\nthe Thames and the smoke of coal crept into the basilica, and spread a\r\ndenser dusk around.\r\n\r\nAt last a twilight spread out in a corner filled with the dimmest\r\nshadows: with fixed gaze I watched the progressive growth of the light;\r\ndid it emanate from the two sons[177] of Edward IV., assassinated by\r\ntheir uncle? The great tragedian says:\r\n\r\n    \"O thus,\" quoth Dighton, \"lay the gentle babes,\"--\r\n    \"Thus, thus,\" quoth Forrest, \"girdling one another\r\n     Within their alabaster innocent arms:\r\n     Their lips were four red roses on a stalk,\r\n     Which, in their summer beauty, kiss'd each other[178].\"\r\n\r\nGod did not send me those two sad and charming souls; but the light\r\nphantom of a scarcely adolescent woman appeared carrying a light\r\nsheltered in a sheet of paper twisted shell-wise: it was the little\r\nbell-ringer. I heard the sound of a kiss, and the bell tolled the break\r\nof day. The ringer was quite terrified when I went out with her through\r\nthe gate of the cloisters. I told her of my adventure; she said she\r\nhad come to do duty for her father, who was sick: we did not speak of\r\nthe kiss.\r\n\r\n*\r\n\r\nI amused Hingant with the story of my adventure, and we made a plan to\r\nlock ourselves in at Westminster; but our distress summoned us to the\r\ndead in a less poetic manner.\r\n\r\nMy funds were becoming exhausted: Baylis and Deboffe had ventured,\r\nagainst a written promise of reimbursement in case of non-sale, to\r\ncommence the printing of the _Essai_; there their generosity ended,\r\nand very naturally; I was even astonished at their boldness. The\r\ntranslations fell off; Peltier, a man of pleasure, grew weary of his\r\nprolonged obligingness. He would willingly have given me what he had,\r\nif he had not preferred to squander it; but to go looking here and\r\nthere for work, to do patient acts of kindness, was beyond him. Hingant\r\nalso saw his treasure diminishing; we were reduced to sixty francs\r\nbetween us. We cut down our rations, as on a vessel when the passage\r\nis prolonged. Instead of a shilling apiece, we spent only sixpence on\r\nour dinner. With our morning tea we reduced the bread by one half,\r\nand suppressed the butter. This abstinence vexed my friend's nerves.\r\nHis wits went wool-gathering; he would prick his ears and seem to be\r\nlistening to some one; he would burst out laughing in reply, or shed\r\ntears. Hingant believed in magnetism, and had disordered his brain with\r\nSwedenborg's[179] rubbish. He told me in the morning that he had heard\r\nnoises during the night; if I denied his fancies he grew angry. The\r\nanxiety which he caused me prevented me from feeling my own sufferings.\r\n\r\nThese were great, nevertheless: that rigorous diet, combined with\r\nthe work, chafed my diseased chest; I began to find a difficulty in\r\nwalking, and yet I spent my days and a part of my nights out of doors,\r\nso as not to betray my distress. When we came to our last shilling,\r\nmy friend and I agreed to keep it in order to make a pretense of\r\nbreakfasting. We arranged that we should buy a penny roll; that we\r\nshould have the hot water and the tea-pot brought up as usual; that we\r\nshould not put in any tea; that we should not eat the bread, but that\r\nwe should drink the hot water with a few little morsels of sugar left\r\nat the bottom of the bowl.\r\n\r\nFive days passed in this fashion. I was devoured with hunger; I burned\r\nwith fever; sleep had deserted me; I sucked pieces of linen which I\r\nsoaked in water; I chewed grass and paper. When I passed the bakers'\r\nshops, the torment I endured was horrible. One rough winter's night,\r\nI stood for two hours outside a shop where they sold dried fruits and\r\nsmoked meats, swallowing all I saw with my eyes: I could have eaten\r\nnot only the provisions, but the boxes and baskets in which they were\r\npacked.\r\n\r\nOn the morning of the fifth day, dropping from inanition, I dragged\r\nmyself to Hingant's; I knocked at the door: it was closed. I called\r\nout; Hingant was some time without answering: at last he rose and\r\nopened the door. He laughed with a bewildered air; his frock-coat was\r\nbuttoned; he sat down at the tea-table.\r\n\r\n\"Our breakfast is coming,\" he said in a strange voice.\r\n\r\nI thought I saw some stains of blood on his shirt; I suddenly\r\nunbuttoned his coat: he had given himself a wound with a penknife,\r\ntwo inches deep, in his left breast. I called out for help. The\r\nmaid-servant went to fetch a surgeon. The wound was dangerous.\r\n\r\nThis new misfortune obliged me to take a resolution. Hingant, who was\r\na counsellor to the Parliament of Brittany, had refused to take the\r\nsalary which the English Government allowed the French magistrates, in\r\nthe same way that I had declined the shilling a day doled out to the\r\nEmigrants: I wrote to M. de Barentin[180] and disclosed my friend's\r\nposition to him. Hingant's relations hurried to his assistance and\r\ntook him away to the country. At that very moment my uncle de Bedée\r\nforwarded me forty crowns, a touching offering from my persecuted\r\nfamily. I seemed to see all the gold of Peru before my eyes: the mite\r\nof the French prisoners supported the exiled Frenchman.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Destitution.]\r\n\r\nMy destitution had impeded my work. As I delivered no more manuscript,\r\nthe printing was suspended. Deprived of Hingant's company, I did not\r\nkeep on my room at Baylis' at a guinea per month; I paid the quarter\r\nthat was due and went away. Below the needy Emigrants who had served\r\nas my first protectors in London were others who were even more\r\nnecessitous. There are degrees among the poor as among the rich; one\r\ncan go from the man who in winter keeps himself warm with his dog\r\ndown to him who shivers in his torn rags. My friends found me a room\r\nmore suited to my diminishing fortune: one is not always at the height\r\nof prosperity! They installed me in the neighbourhood of Marylebone\r\nStreet, in a garret whose dormer window overlooked a cemetery: every\r\nnight the watchman's rattle told me of the proximity of body-snatchers.\r\nI had the consolation to hear that Hingant was out of danger.\r\n\r\nFriends came to see me in my work-room. To judge from our independence\r\nand our poverty, we might have been taken for painters on the ruins of\r\nRome; we were artists in wretchedness on the ruins of France. My face\r\nserved as a model, my bed as a seat for my pupils. The bed consisted of\r\na mattress and a blanket. I had no sheets; when it was cold my coat and\r\na chair, added to my blanket, kept me warm. I was too weak to make my\r\nbed; it remained turned down as God had left it.\r\n\r\nMy cousin de La Boüétardais, turned out of a low Irish lodging for not\r\npaying his rent, although he had put his violin in pawn, came to ask me\r\nfor a shelter against the constable: a vicar from Lower Brittany lent\r\nhim a trestle-bed. La Boüétardais, like Hingant, had been a counsellor\r\nto the Parliament of Brittany; he did not possess a handkerchief to\r\ntie round his head; but he had deserted with bag and baggage, that is\r\nto say, he had brought away his square cap and his red robe, and he\r\nslept under the purple by my side. Jocular, a good musician with a fine\r\nvoice, on nights when we could not sleep he would sit up quite naked\r\non his trestles, put on his square cap, and sing ballads, accompanying\r\nhimself on a guitar with only three strings. One night when the poor\r\nfellow was in this way humming _Scendi propizia_ from Metastasio's[181]\r\n_Hymn to Venus_, he was struck by a draught; he twisted his mouth, and\r\nhe died of it, but not at once, for I rubbed his cheek heartily. We\r\nheld counsel in our elevated room, argued on politics, and discussed\r\nthe gossip of the Emigration. In the evening, we went to our aunts and\r\ncousins to dance, after the dresses had been trimmed with ribbons and\r\nthe hats made up.\r\n\r\nThey who read this portion of my Memoirs are not aware that I have\r\ninterrupted them twice: once to offer a great dinner to the Duke of\r\nYork, brother of the King of England; and once to give a rout on the\r\nanniversary of the entry of the King of France into Paris, on the 8th\r\nof July. That rout cost me forty thousand francs. Peers and peeresses\r\nof the British Empire, ambassadors, distinguished foreigners filled\r\nmy gorgeously-decorated rooms. My tables gleamed with the glitter of\r\nLondon crystal and the gold of Sèvres porcelain. The most delicate\r\ndainties, wines and flowers abounded. Portland Place was blocked with\r\nsplendid carriages. Collinet and the band from Almack's enraptured the\r\nfashionable melancholy of the dandies and the dreamy elegance of the\r\npensively-dancing ladies. The Opposition and the Ministerial majority\r\nhad struck a truce: Mrs. Canning[182] talked to Lord Londonderry, Lady\r\nJersey to the Duke of Wellington. Monsieur, who this year sent me his\r\ncompliments on the sumptuousness of my entertainments in 1822, did\r\nnot know in 1793 that, not far from him, lived a future minister who,\r\nwhile awaiting the advent of his greatness, fasted over a cemetery for\r\nhis sin of loyalty. I congratulate myself to-day on having experienced\r\nshipwreck, gone through war, and shared the sufferings of the humblest\r\nclasses of society, as I applaud myself for meeting with injustice and\r\ncalumny in times of prosperity. I have profited by these lessons: life,\r\nwithout the ills that make it serious, is a child's bauble.\r\n\r\n*\r\n\r\nI was the man with the forty crowns; but since fortunes had not yet\r\nbeen levelled, nor the price of commodities reduced, there was nothing\r\nto serve as a counterpoise to my rapidly diminishing purse. I could\r\nnot reckon on further help from my family, exposed in Brittany to the\r\ndouble scourge of the Chouans[183] and the Terror. I saw nothing before\r\nme but the workhouse or the Thames.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: A contrast.]\r\n\r\nSome of the Emigrants' servants, whom their masters could no longer\r\nfeed, had turned into eating-house keepers in order to feed their\r\nmasters. God knows the merry meals that were made at these ordinaries!\r\nGod knows, too, what politics were talked there! All the victories\r\nof the Republic were turned into defeats, and, if by chance one\r\nentertained a doubt as to an immediate restoration, he was declared a\r\nJacobin. Two old bishops, who looked like live corpses, were walking\r\none morning in St James's Park:\r\n\r\n\"Monseigneur,\" said one, \"do you think we shall be in France by June?\"\r\n\r\n\"Why, monseigneur,\" replied the other, after ripe reflection, \"I see\r\nnothing against it.\"\r\n\r\nPeltier, the man of resource, unearthed me, or rather unnested me,\r\nin my eyry. He had read in a Yarmouth newspaper that a society of\r\nantiquarians was going to produce a history of the County of Suffolk,\r\nand that they wanted a Frenchman able to decipher some French\r\ntwelfth-century manuscripts from the Camden[184] Collection. The parson\r\nat Beccles was at the head of the undertaking; he was the man to whom\r\nto apply.\r\n\r\n\"That will just suit you,\" said Peltier; \"go down there, decipher that\r\nold waste-paper, go on sending copy for the _Essai_ to Baylis; I'll\r\nmake the wretch go on with his printing; and you will come back to\r\nLondon with two hundred guineas in your pocket, your work done, and go\r\nahead!\" I tried to stammer out some objections:\r\n\r\n\"What the deuce!\" cried my man. \"Do you want to stay in this\r\n_palace_, where I'm catching cold already? If Rivarol, Champcenetz,\r\nMirabeau-Tonneau and I had gone about pursing up our mouths, a fine\r\nbusiness we should have made of the _Actes des Apôtres!_ Do you know\r\nthat that story of Hingant is making the devil of a to-do? So you both\r\nwanted to let yourself die of hunger, did you? Ha, ha, ha! Pouf!....\r\nHa, ha!\"\r\n\r\nPeltier, doubled in two, was holding his knees with laughter. He had\r\njust received a hundred subscriptions to his paper from the colonies;\r\nhe had been paid for them, and jingled his guineas in his pocket. He\r\ndragged me by main force, together with the apoplectic La Boüétardais\r\nand two tattered Emigrants who were at hand, to dine at the London\r\nTavern. He made us drink port and eat roast beef and plum-pudding till\r\nwe were ready to burst.\r\n\r\n\"Monsieur le comte,\" he asked my cousin, \"what makes you carry your\r\npotato-trap askew like that?\"\r\n\r\nLa Boüétardais, half shocked, half pleased, explained the thing as\r\nbest he could; he described how he had been suddenly seized while\r\nsinging the words, \"_O bella Venere!_\" My poor paralytic looked so\r\ndead, so benumbed, so shabby, as he stammered out his \"_bella Venere_\"\r\nthat Peltier fell back, roaring with laughter, and almost upset the\r\ntable by striking it with his two feet underneath.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: I go to Beccles.]\r\n\r\nUpon reflection, the advice of my fellow-countryman, a real character\r\nout of my other fellow-countryman, Le Sage[185], did not appear to me\r\nso bad. After three days spent in making inquiries and in obtaining\r\nsome clothes from Peltier's tailor, I set out for Beccles with some\r\nmoney lent me by Deboffe, on the understanding that I was going on\r\nwith the _Essai._ I changed my name, which no Englishman was able to\r\npronounce, for that of Combourg, which had been borne by my brother,\r\nand which reminded me of the sorrows and pleasures of my early youth.\r\nI alighted at the inn, and handed the minister of the place a letter\r\nfrom Deboffe, who was greatly esteemed in the English book-world. The\r\nletter recommended me as a scholar of the first rank. I was very well\r\nreceived, saw all the gentlemen of the district, and met two officers\r\nof our Royal Navy who were giving French lessons in the neighbourhood.\r\n\r\n*\r\n\r\nMy strength improved; my trips on horseback restored my health a\r\nlittle. England, viewed thus in detail, was melancholy, but charming;\r\nit was the same thing, the same outlook wherever I went. M. de Combourg\r\nwas invited to every party. I owed to study the first alleviation of\r\nmy lot. Cicero was right to recommend the commerce of letters in the\r\ntroubles of life. The women were delighted to meet a Frenchman to talk\r\nFrench with.\r\n\r\nThe misfortunes of my family, which I learnt from the newspapers,\r\nand which made me known by my real name (for I was unable to conceal\r\nmy grief), increased the interest which my acquaintances took in me.\r\nThe public journals announced the death of M. de Malesherbes; of his\r\ndaughter, Madame la Présidente de Rosanbo; of his granddaughter,\r\nMadame de Chateaubriand; and of his grandson-in-law, the Comte de\r\nChateaubriand, my brother, all immolated together, on the same day,\r\nat the same hour, on the same scaffold[186]. M. de Malesherbes was\r\nan object of admiration and veneration among the English; my family\r\nconnection with the defender of Louis XVI. added to the kindness of my\r\nhosts.\r\n\r\nMy uncle de Bedée informed me of the persecutions endured by the rest\r\nof my relations. My old and incomparable mother had been flung into a\r\ncart with other victims and carried from the depths of Brittany to the\r\ngaols of Paris, in order to share the lot of the son whom she had loved\r\nso well. My wife and my sister Lucile were awaiting their sentence in\r\nthe dungeons at Rennes; there had been a question of imprisoning them\r\nat Combourg Castle, which had become a State fortress: their innocence\r\nwas accused of the crime of my emigration. What were our sorrows on\r\nforeign soil compared with those of the French who had remained at\r\nhome? And yet, what unhappiness, amid the sufferings of exile, to know\r\nthat our very exile was made the pretext for the persecution of our kin.\r\n\r\nTwo years ago my sister-in-law's wedding ring was picked up in the\r\nkennel of the Rue Cassette; it was brought to me, broken; the two hoops\r\nof the ring had come apart and hung linked together; the names were\r\nclearly legible engraved inside. How had the ring come to be found\r\nthere? When and where had it been lost? Had the victim, imprisoned at\r\nthe Luxembourg, passed by the Rue Cassette on her way to execution? Had\r\nshe dropped the ring from the tumbril? Had the ring been torn from her\r\nfinger after the execution? I was shocked at the sight of this symbol,\r\nwhich, both by its broken condition and its inscription, reminded me of\r\na destiny so cruel. Something fatal and mysterious was attached to this\r\nring, which my sister-in-law seemed to send me from among the dead, in\r\nmemory of herself and my brother. I have given it to her son[187]: may\r\nit not bring him ill-luck!\r\n\r\n    Cher orphelin, image de ta mère,\r\n    Au ciel pour toi, je demande, ici-bas,\r\n    Les jours heureux retranchés à ton père\r\n    Et les enfants que ton oncle n'a pas[188].\r\n\r\nThis halting stanza and two or three others are the only present I was\r\nable to make my nephew on his marriage.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Execution of my brother.]\r\n\r\nAnother relic remains to me of these misfortunes. The following is a\r\nletter which M. de Contencin wrote to me when, in turning over the city\r\nrecords, he found the order of the revolutionary tribunal which sent my\r\nbrother and his family to the scaffold:\r\n\r\n    \"Monsieur le vicomte,\r\n\r\n    \"There is a sort of cruelty in awaking in a mind that has\r\n    suffered much the memory of the ills which have affected it\r\n    most painfully. This consideration made me hesitate some time\r\n    before offering for your acceptance a very pathetic document,\r\n    upon which I alighted in the course of my historical\r\n    researches. It is a death-certificate, signed before the\r\n    decease by a man who always displayed himself as implacable\r\n    as death itself, whenever he found illustriousness and virtue\r\n    united in the same person.\r\n\r\n    \"I hope, monsieur le vicomte, that you will not take it too\r\n    ill of me if I add to your family records a document which\r\n    recalls such cruel memories. I presumed that it would have an\r\n    interest for you, since it had a value in my eyes, and I at\r\n    once thought of offering it to you. If I am not guilty of an\r\n    indiscretion, I shall be doubly gratified, as this proceeding\r\n    gives me the opportunity to express to you the feelings of\r\n    profound respect and sincere admiration with which you have\r\n    long inspired me, and with I am, monsieur le vicomte,\r\n\r\n    \"your most humble, obedient servant,\r\n\r\n    \"A. DE CONTENCIN.\r\n\r\n    \"Prefecture of the Seine,\r\n\r\n    \"Paris, 28 _March_ 1835.\"\r\n\r\nI replied to the above letter as follows:\r\n\r\n    \"I had had the Sainte-Chapelle searched, monsieur, for the\r\n    documents concerning the trial of my unfortunate brother and\r\n    his wife, but the 'order' which you have been good enough to\r\n    send me was not to be found. This order and so many others,\r\n    with their erasures and their mangled names, have doubtless\r\n    been presented to Fouquier before the tribunal of God; he\r\n    will have been compelled to acknowledge his signature. Those\r\n    are the times which people regret, and on which they write\r\n    volumes filled with admiration! For the rest, I envy my\r\n    brother: he, at least, has since many a long year quitted\r\n    this sad world. I thank you infinitely, monsieur, for the\r\n    esteem which you have shown me in your beautiful and noble\r\n    letter, and I beg you to accept the assurance of the very\r\n    distinguished consideration with which I have the honour to\r\n    be, etc.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThis death order is, above all, remarkable for the proof which it\r\naffords of the levity with which the murders were committed: names\r\nare wrongly spelt, others are effaced. These defects of form, which\r\nwould have been enough to stay the simplest sentence, did not stop\r\nthe headsmen; all they cared for was the exact hour of death: \"at\r\nfive o'clock precisely.\" Here is the authentic document, I copy it\r\nfaithfully:\r\n\r\n    \"Executor of Criminal Judgments,\r\n\r\n    \"REVOLUTIONARY TRIBUNAL.\r\n\r\n    \"The executor of criminal judgments will not fail to go to\r\n    the house of justice of the Conciergerie, there to execute\r\n    the judgment which condemns Mousset, d'Esprémenil, Chapelier,\r\n    Thouret, Hell, Lamoignon Malsherbes, the woman Lepelletier\r\n    Rosambo, Chateau Brian, and his wife [proper name effaced\r\n    and illegible], the widow Duchatelet, the wife of Grammont,\r\n    formerly duke, the woman Rochechuart [Rochechouart], and\r\n    Parmentier;--14, to the penalty of death.

The conventional commissary found her:\r\n\r\n\"What are you doing here, citizeness?\" he asked. \"Who are you? Why do\r\nyou stay here?\"\r\n\r\nMy mother replied that, having lost her son, she had not inquired what\r\nwas going on, and that it was indifferent to her whether she died in\r\nprison or elsewhere.\r\n\r\n\"But perhaps you have other children?\" said the commissary.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Release of my mother.]\r\n\r\nMy mother mentioned my wife and sisters detained in custody at Rennes.\r\nAn order was sent to place them at liberty, and my mother was compelled\r\nto leave the prison.\r\n\r\nIn the histories of the Revolution, the writers have omitted to set the\r\npicture of outer France by the side of the picture of inner France,\r\nto depict that great colony of exiles, changing its industry and its\r\nsorrows in accordance with the diversity of climate and the difference\r\nin national manners.\r\n\r\nOutside France, everything operated by individuals: changes of\r\ncondition, obscure afflictions, noiseless and unrewarded sacrifices;\r\nand, in this variety of individuals of every rank, age and sex, one\r\nfixed idea was preserved: that of Old France travelling with her\r\nprejudices and her faithful sons, as formerly the Church of God had\r\nwandered over the earth with her virtues and her martyrs.\r\n\r\nInside France, everything operated in the mass: Barère announcing\r\nmurders and conquests, civil wars and foreign wars; the gigantic\r\ncombats of the Vendée and on the banks of the Rhine; thrones toppling\r\nto the sound of the march of our armies; our fleets swallowed up by the\r\nwaves; the people disinterring the monarchs at Saint-Denis and flinging\r\nthe dust of the dead kings into the eyes of the living kings to blind\r\nthem; New France, glorying in her new-found liberties, proud even of\r\nher crimes, steadfast on her own soil, while extending her frontiers,\r\ndoubly armed with the headsman's blade and the soldier's sword.\r\n\r\nIn the midst of my family sorrows I received some letters from my\r\nfriend Hingant, to reassure me as to his fate: letters very remarkable\r\nin themselves; he wrote to me in September 1795:\r\n\r\n    \"Your letter of the 23rd of August is full of the most\r\n    touching feeling. I showed it to a few people, whose eyes\r\n    filled with tears on reading it. I was almost tempted to say\r\n    what Diderot said on the day when J. J. Rousseau came and\r\n    cried in his prison at Vincennes:\r\n\r\n    \"'See how my friends love me.'\r\n\r\n    \"My illness, as a matter of fact, was only one of those\r\n    nervous fevers which cause great suffering, and for which\r\n    time and patience are the best remedies. During the fever I\r\n    read extracts from the _Phædo_ and _Timæus_, and I said with\r\n    Cato:\r\n\r\n    \"'It must be so, Plato; thou reason'st well[189]!'\r\n\r\n    \"I had formed an idea of my journey as one might form an idea\r\n    of a voyage to India. I imagined that I should see many new\r\n    objects in the 'spirit world,' as Swedenborg calls it, and\r\n    above all that I should be free from the fatigue and dangers\r\n    of the journey.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nEight miles from Beccles, in a little town called Bungay, lived an\r\nEnglish clergyman, the Rev. Mr. Ives[190], a great Hellenist and\r\nmathematician. He had a wife who was still young, with a charming\r\nappearance, mind and manners, and an only daughter, fifteen years of\r\nage. I was introduced to this household, and was better received there\r\nthan anywhere else. We took our wine in the old English fashion, and\r\nsat two hours at table after the ladies had left. Mr. Ives, who had\r\nbeen to America, liked to tell of his travels, to hear the story of my\r\nown, to talk of Newton and Homer. His daughter, who had become learned\r\nin order to please her father, was an excellent musician, and sang as\r\nMadame Pasta[191] sings to-day. She reappeared in time to pour out\r\ntea, and charmed away the old parson's infectious drowsiness. Leaning\r\nagainst the end of the piano, I listened to Miss Ives in silence.\r\n\r\nWhen the music was over, the young lady questioned me about France,\r\nabout literature; asked me to set her plans of studies; she wished\r\nparticularly to know the Italian authors, and begged me to give her\r\nsome notes on the _Divina Commedia_ and the _Gerusalemme._ Gradually\r\nI began to experience a timid charm that issued from the soul: I had\r\ndecked the Floridans, I should not have ventured to pick up Miss Ives's\r\nglove; I grew confused when I tried to translate a passage from Tasso.\r\nI was more at my ease with that chaster and more masculine genius,\r\nDante.\r\n\r\nCharlotte Ives's age and my own were suited. Into friendships formed\r\nin the midst of one's career, there enters a certain melancholy;\r\nwhen two people do not meet at the very outset, the memories of the\r\nperson beloved are not mingled with that portion of our days in which\r\nwe breathed without knowing her: those days, which belong to another\r\nsociety, are painful to the memory, and as though curtailed from\r\nour existence. When there is a disproportion of age, the drawbacks\r\nincrease: the older of the two commenced life before the younger was\r\nborn; the younger is destined to remain alone in his turn: one has\r\nwalked in a solitude this side of a cradle, the other will cross a\r\nsolitude that side of a tomb; the past was a desert for the first, the\r\nfuture will be a desert for the second. It is difficult to be in love\r\nin all the conditions that produce happiness: youth, beauty, seasonable\r\ntime, harmony of hearts, tastes, character, graces, and years.\r\n\r\nHaving had a fall from my horse, I stayed some time with Mr. Ives. It\r\nwas winter; the dreams of my life began to flee before reality. Miss\r\nIves became more reserved; she ceased to bring me flowers; she would no\r\nlonger sing.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Charlotte Ives.]\r\n\r\nIf I could have been told that I should pass the rest of my life\r\nunknown in the bosom of this retiring family, I should have died of\r\npleasure: love needs but permanency to become at once an Eden before\r\nthe fall and an Hosanna without end. Contrive that beauty lasts, that\r\nyouth remains, that the heart can never weary, and you reproduce\r\nHeaven. Love is so surely the sovereign felicity that it is pursued\r\nby the phantom of perpetuity; it will consent to pronounce only\r\nirrevocable vows; in the absence of joys, it seeks to make endless\r\nits sorrows; a fallen angel, it still speaks the language it spoke\r\nin the incorruptible abode; its hope is that it may never cease; in\r\nits twofold nature and its twofold illusion here below, it strives to\r\nperpetuate itself by immortal thoughts and never-failing generations.\r\n\r\nI beheld with dismay the moment approach when I should be obliged to\r\ngo. On the eve of the day announced for my departure, our dinner was a\r\ngloomy one. To my great surprise, Mr. Ives withdrew at dessert, taking\r\nhis daughter with him, and I remained alone with Mrs. Ives: she was\r\nextremely embarrassed. I thought she was going to reproach me with\r\nan inclination which she might have discovered, although I had never\r\nmentioned it. She looked at me, lowered her eyes, blushed; herself\r\nbewitching in her confusion, there was no sentiment which she might not\r\nby right have claimed for herself. At last, overcoming with an effort\r\nthe obstacle which had prevented her from speaking:\r\n\r\n\"Sir,\" she said in English, \"you behold my confusion: I do not know if\r\nCharlotte pleases you, but it is impossible to deceive a mother's eyes;\r\nmy daughter has certainly conceived an attachment for you. Mr. Ives and\r\nI have consulted together: you suit us in every respect; we believe you\r\nwill make our daughter happy. You no longer possess a country; you have\r\nlost your relations; your property is sold: what is there to take you\r\nback to France? Until you inherit what we have, you will live with us.\"\r\n\r\nOf all the sorrows that I had undergone, this was the sorest and\r\ngreatest. I threw myself at Mrs. Ives's feet; I covered her hands with\r\nmy kisses and my tears. She thought I was weeping with happiness, and\r\nherself began to sob for joy. She stretched out her arm to pull the\r\nbell-rope; she called her husband and daughter:\r\n\r\n\"Stop!\" I cried. \"I am a married man!\"\r\n\r\nShe fell back fainting.\r\n\r\nI went out and, without returning to my room, left the house on foot I\r\nreached Beccles and took the mail for London, after writing a letter to\r\nMrs. Ives of which I regret that I did not keep a copy.\r\n\r\nI have retained the sweetest, the tenderest, the most grateful\r\nrecollection of that event. Before I made my name, Mr. Ives's family\r\nwas the only one that bore me good-will and welcomed me with genuine\r\naffection. Poor, unknown, proscribed, with neither beauty nor\r\nattraction, I was offered an assured future, a country, a charming\r\nwife to take me out of my loneliness, a mother almost as beautiful to\r\nfill the place of my old mother, a father full of information, loving\r\nand cultivating literature, to replace the father of whom Heaven had\r\nbereaved me: what did I bring to set off against all that? No illusion\r\ncould possibly enter into the choice they made of me; there was no\r\ndoubt that I was loved. Since that time, I have met with but one\r\nattachment sufficiently lofty to inspire me with the same confidence.\r\nAs to any interest of which I may subsequently have been the object, I\r\nhave never been able to make out whether outward causes, a noisy fame,\r\nofficial finery, the glamour of a high literary or political position\r\nwere not the covering which attracted the attentions shown to me.\r\n\r\nFor the rest, if I had married Charlotte Ives, my part on earth would\r\nhave been changed: buried in an English county, I should have become a\r\nsporting gentleman; not a single line would have fallen from my pen; I\r\nshould even have forgotten my language, for I wrote in English, and\r\nmy ideas were beginning to take shape in English in my head. Would\r\nmy country have lost much by my disappearance? If I could put on one\r\nside that which has consoled me, I would say that I should already\r\nhave numbered days of calm, instead of the troubled days that have\r\nfallen to my share. The Empire, the Restoration, the divisions and\r\nquarrels of France: what would all that have mattered to me? I should\r\nnot each morning have to palliate faults, to contend with errors. Is\r\nit certain that I possess a real talent, and that that talent is worth\r\nthe sacrifice of my whole life? Shall I outlast my tomb? If I do go\r\nbeyond it, in the transformation which is now being brought about, in\r\na changed world occupied with very different things, will there be a\r\npublic to hear me? Shall I not be a man of the past, unintelligible to\r\nthe new generations? Will not my ideas, my opinions, my very style seem\r\ntedious and antiquated to a scornful posterity? Will my shade be able\r\nto say, as the shade of Virgil said to Dante:\r\n\r\n    \"_Poeta fui e cantai_: I was a poet and I sang?\"[192]\r\n\r\n\r\n*\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: I return to London.]\r\n\r\nI returned to London, but found no repose: I had fled from my fate as\r\na miscreant from his crime. How painful it must have been to a family\r\nso worthy of my homage, of my respect, of my gratitude, to receive a\r\nsort of refusal from the unknown man whom they had welcomed, to whom\r\nthey had offered a new home with a simplicity, an absence of suspicion,\r\nof precaution, almost patriarchal in character! I imagined Charlotte's\r\ngrief, the just reproaches with which I was liable and deserved to\r\nbe covered: for, after all, I had taken pleasure in yielding to an\r\ninclination of which I knew the insuperable unlawfulness. Had I, in\r\nfact, made a vain attempt at seduction, without taking into account the\r\nheinousness of my conduct? But whether I stopped, as I did, in order to\r\nremain an honest man, or overcame all obstacles in order to surrender\r\nto an inclination stigmatized beforehand through my conduct, I could\r\nonly have plunged the object of that seduction into sorrow or regret.\r\n\r\nFrom these bitter reflections I abandoned myself to other thoughts no\r\nless filled with bitterness: I cursed my marriage, which, according to\r\nthe false perception of a mind at that time very sick, had thrown me\r\nout of my course and was robbing me of happiness. I did not reflect\r\nthat, on account of the ailing temperament to which I was subject, and\r\nthe romantic notions of liberty which I cherished, a marriage with Miss\r\nIves would have been as painful to me as a more independent union.\r\n\r\nOne thing within me remained pure and charming, although profoundly\r\nsad: the image of Charlotte; that image ended by prevailing over my\r\nrevolts against my fate. I was tempted a hundred times to return to\r\nBungay, not to appear before the troubled family, but to hide by the\r\nroad-side to see Charlotte pass, to follow her to the temple where\r\nwe had the same God, if not the same altar, in common, to offer that\r\nwoman, through the medium of Heaven, the inexpressible ardour of my\r\nvows, to pronounce, at least in thought, the prayer from the nuptial\r\nbenediction which I might have heard from a clergyman's lips in that\r\ntemple:\r\n\r\n    \"O God,... look mercifully upon this thy handmaid. ... now to\r\n    be joined in wedlock.... May it be to her a yoke of love and\r\n    peace.... May she be fruitful in offspring ... that they may\r\n    both see their children's children unto the third and fourth\r\n    generation, and arrive at a desired old age[193].\"\r\n\r\nWavering between resolve and resolve, I wrote Charlotte long letters\r\nwhich I tore up. A few unimportant notes which I had received from her\r\nserved me as a talisman; attached to my steps by my thought, Charlotte,\r\ngracious and compassionate, followed me along the paths of my sylph,\r\npurifying them as she went. She absorbed my faculties; she was the\r\ncentre through which my intelligence made its way, in the same way as\r\nthe blood passes through the heart; she disgusted me with all else, for\r\nI made of her a perpetual object of comparison to her advantage. A real\r\nand unhappy passion is a poisoned leaven which remains at the bottom of\r\nthe soul, and which would poison the bread of the angels.\r\n\r\nThe spots by which I had wandered, the hours and words which I had\r\nexchanged with Charlotte, were engraved on my memory: I saw the smile\r\nof the wife who had been destined for me; I respectfully touched\r\nher black tresses; I pressed her shapely arms to my breast, like a\r\nchain which I might have worn round my neck. No sooner was I in some\r\nsequestered spot than Charlotte, with her white hands, came to sit by\r\nmy side. I divined her presence, as at night one inhales the perfume of\r\nunseen flowers.\r\n\r\nI had lost Hingant's company, and my walks, more solitary than before,\r\nleft me full liberty to carry with me the image of Charlotte. There was\r\nnot a common, a road, a church, within thirty miles of London, that I\r\ndid not visit. The most deserted places, a field of nettles, a ditch\r\nplanted with thistles, all that was neglected by men, became favourite\r\nspots for me, and in those spots Byron already drew breath. Leaning my\r\nhead upon my hand, I contemplated the scorned sites; when their painful\r\nimpression affected me too greatly, the memory of Charlotte came to\r\nenchant me: I was then like the pilgrim who, on reaching a solitude\r\nwithin view of the rocks of Mount Sinai, heard the nightingale sing.\r\n\r\nIn London, my habits aroused surprise. I looked at nobody, I never\r\nreplied, I did not know what was said to me: my old associates\r\nsuspected me of madness.\r\n\r\n*\r\n\r\nWhat happened at Bungay after my departure? What became of that family\r\nto which I had brought joy and mourning?\r\n\r\nYou will have remembered that I am at present Ambassador to the Court\r\nof George IV., and that I am writing in London, in 1822, of what\r\nhappened to me in London in 1795.\r\n\r\nSome matters of business obliged me, a week ago, to interrupt the\r\nnarrative which I resume to-day. During this interval, my man came and\r\ntold me one morning, between twelve and one o'clock, that a carriage\r\nhad stopped at my door and that an English lady was asking to see me.\r\nAs I have made it a rule, in my public position, to deny myself to\r\nnobody, I ordered the lady to be shown up.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Lady Sutton.]\r\n\r\nI was in my study, when Lady Sutton was announced; I saw a lady in\r\nmourning enter the room, accompanied by two handsome boys also in\r\nmourning: one might have been sixteen, the other fourteen years of age.\r\nI went towards the stranger; her perturbation was such that she could\r\nhardly walk. She said to me, in faltering accents:\r\n\r\n\"My lord, do you remember me?\"\r\n\r\nYes, I remembered Miss Ives! The years which had passed over her head\r\nhad left only their spring-time behind. I took her by the hand, I made\r\nher sit down, and I sat down by her side. I could not speak; my eyes\r\nwere full of tears; I gazed at her in silence through those tears; I\r\nfelt how deeply I had loved her by what I was now experiencing. At last\r\nI was able to say, in my turn:\r\n\r\n\"And you, madam, do you remember me?\"\r\n\r\nShe raised her eyes, which till then she had kept lowered, and for sole\r\nreply gave me a smiling and melancholy glance, like a long remembrance.\r\nHer hand still lay between mine. Charlotte said to me:\r\n\r\n\"I am in mourning for my mother; my father has been dead many years.\r\nThese are my children.\"\r\n\r\nAt these words, she drew away her hand and sank back into her chair,\r\ncovering her eyes with her handkerchief. Soon she resumed:\r\n\r\n\"My lord, I am now speaking to you in the language which I practised\r\nwith you at Bungay. I am ashamed: excuse me. My children are the sons\r\nof Admiral Sutton[194], whom I married three years after your departure\r\nfrom England. But I am not sufficiently self-possessed to-day to tell\r\nyou the details. Permit me to come again.\"\r\n\r\nI asked her for her address, and gave her my arm to take her to her\r\ncarriage. She trembled, and I pressed her hand to my heart.\r\n\r\nI called on Lady Sutton the next day; I found her alone. Then there\r\nbegan between us a long series of those \"Do you remember?\" questions\r\nwhich cause a whole life-time to revive. At each \"Do you remember?\"\r\nwe looked at one another; we sought to discover in each other's\r\nfaces those traces of time which so cruelly mark the distance from\r\nthe starting-point and the length of the road traversed. I said to\r\nCharlotte:\r\n\r\n\"How did your mother tell you?\"\r\n\r\nCharlotte blushed, and hastily interrupted me:\r\n\r\n\"I have come to London to ask you to interest yourself on behalf of\r\nAdmiral Sutton's children. The eldest would like to go to Bombay. Mr.\r\nCanning, who has been appointed Governor-General of India, is your\r\nfriend; he might consent to take my son with him. I should be very\r\ngrateful to you, and I should like to owe to you the happiness of my\r\nfirst child.\"\r\n\r\nShe laid a stress on these last words.\r\n\r\n\"Ah, madam,\" I replied, \"of what do you remind me? What a subversion of\r\ndestinies! You, who received a poor exile at your father's hospitable\r\nboard; you, who did not scorn his sufferings; you, who perhaps thought\r\nof raising him to a glorious and unhoped-for rank: it is you who now\r\nask his protection in your own country! I will see Mr. Canning; your\r\nson, however much it costs me to give him that name, your son shall go\r\nto India, if it only depends on me. But tell me, madam, how does my new\r\nposition affect you? In what light do you look upon me at present? That\r\nword, 'my lord,' which you employ seems very harsh to me.\"\r\n\r\nCharlotte replied:\r\n\r\n\"I don't think you changed, not even aged. When I spoke of you to my\r\nparents during your absence, I always gave you the title of 'my lord;'\r\nit seemed to me that you had a right to bear it: were you not to me the\r\nsame as a husband, 'my lord and master'.\"\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Sentimental memories.]\r\n\r\nThat graceful woman reminded me of Milton's Eve, as she uttered these\r\nwords: she was not born in the womb of another woman; her beauty bore\r\nthe imprint of the divine hand that had moulded it.\r\n\r\nI went to Mr. Canning and to Lord Londonderry; they made as many\r\ndifficulties about a small place as would have been made in France,\r\nbut they promised, as people promise at Court. I gave Lady Sutton an\r\naccount of the measures I had taken. I saw her three times more: at\r\nmy fourth visit, she told me she was returning to Bungay. This last\r\ninterview was a sad one. Charlotte talked to me once more of the past,\r\nof our secret life, of our reading, our walks, our music, the flowers\r\nof yester-year, the hopes of bygone days.\r\n\r\n\"When I knew you,\" she said, \"no one spoke your name; now, who has\r\nnot heard it? Do you know that I have a work and several letters in\r\nyour handwriting? Here they are.\" And she handed me a packet. \"Do not\r\nbe offended if I prefer to keep nothing of yours.\" She began to weep.\r\n\"Farewell, farewell,\" she said. \"Think of my son. I shall not see you\r\nagain, for you will not come to see me at Bungay.\"\r\n\r\n\"I will,\" I cried; \"I shall come to bring you your son's appointment.\"\r\n\r\nShe shook her head with an air of doubt, and withdrew. On returning to\r\nthe Embassy, I locked myself in and opened the packet. It contained\r\nonly a few unimportant notes from myself and a scheme of studies, with\r\nremarks on the English and Italian poets. I had hoped to find a letter\r\nfrom Charlotte: there was none; but, in the margins of the manuscript,\r\nI perceived some notes in English, French, and Italian: the age of the\r\nink and the youthfulness of the hand in which they were written showed\r\nthat it was long since they had been inscribed upon those margins.\r\n\r\nThat is the story of my relations with Miss Ives. As I finish telling\r\nit, it seems to me as though I were losing a second Charlotte in the\r\nsame island in which I lost the first. But between that which I feel at\r\nthis moment and that which I felt at the hours whose tenderness I have\r\nrecalled lies the whole space of innocence: passions have interposed\r\nthemselves between Miss Ives and Lady Sutton. I could no longer bring\r\nto an artless woman the candour of desire, the sweet ignorance of a\r\nlove that did not surpass the limits of a dream. I was writing then on\r\nthe wave of sadness; I am now no longer tossed on the wave of life.\r\nWell, if I had pressed in my arms, as a wife and a mother, her who was\r\ndestined for me as a virgin and a bride, it would have been with a sort\r\nof rage, to blight, to fill with sorrow, to crush out of existence\r\nthose seven-and-twenty years which had been given to another after\r\nhaving been offered to me.\r\n\r\nI must look upon the sentiment which I have just recalled as the first\r\nof that kind which entered my heart; it was nevertheless in no way\r\nsympathetic with my stormy nature: the latter would have corrupted it\r\nand made me incapable of long enjoying such sacred delectations. It\r\nwas then that, embittered as I was by misfortunes, already a pilgrim\r\nfrom beyond the seas, having begun my solitary travels, it was then\r\nthat I became obsessed by the mad ideas depicted in the mystery of\r\nRené, which turned me into the most tormented being on the face of the\r\nearth. However that may be, the chaste image of Charlotte, by causing a\r\nfew rays of true light to penetrate to the depths of my soul, at first\r\ndissipated a cloud of phantoms: my dæmon, like an evil genius, plunged\r\nback into the abyss, and awaited the effects of time in order to renew\r\nher apparitions.\r\n\r\n*\r\n\r\nMy relations with Deboffe in connection with the _Essai sur les\r\nrévolutions_ had never been completely interrupted, and it was\r\nimportant for me to resume them in London at the earliest possible\r\nmoment to support my material existence. But whence had my last\r\nmisfortune arisen? From my obstinate bent for silence. In order to\r\nunderstand this it is necessary to enter into my character.\r\n\r\nAt no time of my life have I been able to overcome the spirit of\r\nreticence and of mental solitude which prevents me from talking of my\r\nprivate affairs.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: My reserved nature.]\r\n\r\nNo one can state without lying that I have told what most people tell\r\nin a moment of pain, pleasure, or vanity. A name, a confession of any\r\nseriousness never issues, or issues but rarely, from my lips. I never\r\ntalk to casual people of my interests, my plans, my work, my ideas,\r\nmy attachments, my joys, my sorrows, being persuaded of the profound\r\nweariness which one causes to others by talking of one's self. Sincere\r\nand truthful though I be, I am lacking in openness of heart: my soul\r\nincessantly tends to close up; I do not tell anything wholly, and I\r\nhave never allowed my complete life to transpire, except in these\r\nMemoirs. If I try to begin a story, I am suddenly terrified at the\r\nidea of its length; after four words, the sound of my voice becomes\r\nunendurable to me, and I am silent. As I believe in nothing except\r\nreligion, I distrust everything: malevolence and disparagement are the\r\ntwo distinctive qualities of the French mind; derision and calumny, the\r\ncertain result of a confidence.\r\n\r\nBut what have I gained by my reserved nature? To become, because I was\r\nimpenetrable, a fantastic something, having no relation with my real\r\nbeing? My very friends are mistaken in me, when they think that they\r\nare making me better known and when they adorn me with the illusions\r\nof their love for me. All the small intellects of the ante-chambers,\r\nthe public offices, the newspapers, the cafés have assigned ambition\r\nto me, whereas I have none at all. Cold and dry in matters of everyday\r\nlife, I have nothing of the enthusiast or the sentimentalist: my clear\r\nand swift perception quickly pierces men and facts, and strips them of\r\nall importance. Far from carrying me away, from idealizing apposite\r\ntruths, my imagination disparages the loftiest events and baffles\r\neven myself; I see the petty and ridiculous side of things first of\r\nall; great geniuses and great things scarcely exist in my eyes. While\r\nI show myself polite, encomiastic and full of admiration for the\r\nself-conceited minds which proclaim themselves superior intelligences,\r\nmy secret contempt laughs at all those faces intoxicated with incense,\r\nand covers them with Callot[195] masks. In politics, the warmth of my\r\nopinions has never exceeded the length of my speech or my pamphlet.\r\nIn the inner and theoretical life, I am the man of all the dreams; in\r\nthe outer and practical life, I am the man of realities. Adventurous\r\nand orderly, passionate and methodical, I am the most chimerical and\r\nthe most positive, the most ardent and the most icy being that ever\r\nexisted, a whimsical androgynus, formed out of the different blood of\r\nmy mother and my father.\r\n\r\nThe portraits, utterly without resemblance, that have been made of me,\r\nare due in the main to the reticence of my speech. The crowd is too\r\nthoughtless, too inattentive, to see individuals as they are. Whenever,\r\nby chance, I have endeavoured to rectify some of these false judgments\r\nin my prefaces, I have not been believed. In the ultimate result, all\r\nthings being indifferent to me, I have not insisted; an \"as you please\"\r\nhas always rid me of the irksomeness of persuading anyone or of seeking\r\nto establish a truth. I return to my spiritual tribunal, like a hare\r\nto its form: there I resume my contemplation of the moving leaf or the\r\nbending blade of grass.\r\n\r\nI do not make a virtue of my guardedness, which is as invincible as it\r\nis involuntary: although it is not deceitful, it has the appearance of\r\nbeing so; it is not in harmony with natures happier, more amiable, more\r\nfacile, more candid, more ample, more communicative than mine. It has\r\noften injured me in matters of sentiment and business, because I have\r\nnever been able to endure explanations, reconciliations brought about\r\nby protests and elucidations, lamentations and tears, verbiage and\r\nreproaches, details and apologies.\r\n\r\nIn the case of the Ives family, this obstinate silence of mine\r\nconcerning myself proved extremely fatal to me. A score of times\r\nCharlotte's mother had inquired into my family and given me the\r\nopportunity of speaking openly. Not foreseeing whither my silence would\r\nlead me, I contented myself, as usual, with replying in short, vague\r\nsentences. Had I not been the victim of that odious mental perversity,\r\nall misunderstanding would have become impossible, and I should not\r\nhave appeared to wish to deceive the most generous hospitality; the\r\ntruth, as I told it at the last moment, did not excuse me: genuine harm\r\nhad none the less been done.\r\n\r\nI resumed my work in the midst of my grief and of the just reproaches\r\nwith which I covered myself. I even took pleasure in this work, for\r\nit struck me that, by achieving renown, I should be giving the Ives\r\nfamily less cause to repent the interest which they had shown me.\r\nCharlotte, with whom I thus sought to be reconciled through my glory,\r\npresided over my studies. Her image was seated before me while I wrote.\r\nWhen I raised my eyes from the paper, I lifted them upon the adored\r\nimage, as though the original were in fact there. The inhabitants\r\nof Ceylon one morning saw the luminary of day rise in extraordinary\r\nsplendour; its orb opened out, and from it issued a dazzling being, who\r\nsaid to the Cingalese:\r\n\r\n\"I have come to reign over you.\"\r\n\r\nCharlotte, issuing from a ray of light, reigned over me.\r\n\r\nLet us leave these memories; memories grow old and dim like hopes. My\r\nlife is about to change, to speed under other skies, in other valleys.\r\nFirst love of my youth, you flee with all your charms! I have just\r\nseen Charlotte again, it is true; but after how many years did I see\r\nher again? Sweet glimpse of the past, pale rose of the twilight which\r\nborders the night, long after the sun has set!\r\n\r\n*\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The _Essai Historique._]\r\n\r\nLife has often been represented (by me first of all) as a mountain\r\nwhich we climb on one side and descend on the other: it would be as\r\ntrue to compare it to an Alp, to the bare, ice-crowned summit which\r\nhas no reverse. Following up this figure, the traveller always climbs\r\nupwards and never down; he then sees more clearly the space which he\r\nhas covered, the paths which he has not taken, although by doing so\r\nhe could have risen by a gentler slope: he looks down with sorrow and\r\nregret upon the point where he commenced to stray. Thus I must mark\r\nat the publication of the _Essai historique_ the first step which led\r\nme out of the peaceful road. I finished the first part of the great\r\nwork which I had planned; I wrote the last word between the idea of\r\ndeath (I had fallen ill again) and a vanished dream: _In somnis venit\r\nimago conjugis._[196] The _Essai_, printed by Baylis, was published by\r\nDeboffe in 1797[197]. This date marks one of the turning-points in my\r\nlife. There are moments at which our destiny, whether because it yields\r\nto society, or obeys the laws of nature, or begins to make us what we\r\nshall have to remain, suddenly turns aside from its first line, like a\r\nriver which changes its course with a sudden bend.\r\n\r\nThe _Essai_ offers the compendium of my existence as a poet, a\r\nmoralist, a publicist, and a politician. To say that I hoped, in so far\r\nat least as I am capable of hoping, to make a great success with the\r\nwork, goes without saying: we authors, petty prodigies of a prodigious\r\nera, make a claim to keep up intelligence with future races; but we do\r\nnot, I firmly believe, know where posterity lives, and we put the wrong\r\naddress. When we grow numb in our graves, death will freeze our words,\r\nwritten or sung, so hard that they will not melt like the \"frozen\r\nwords\" of Rabelais.\r\n\r\nThe _Essai_ was to be a sort of historical encyclopædia. The only\r\nvolume published is in itself a fairly wide inquiry; I had the sequel\r\nin manuscript; then came, beside the researches and annotations of the\r\nannalist, the lays and roundelays of the poet, the _Natchez_, and so\r\non. I am hardly able to understand to-day how I could give myself up\r\nto such extensive studies amid an active wandering life, subject to so\r\nmany reverses. My obstinacy in working explains this fertility: in my\r\nyoung days I often wrote for twelve or fifteen hours without leaving\r\nthe table at which I sat, scratching out and recommencing the same page\r\nten times over. Age has not caused me to lose any part of this faculty\r\nof application: to this day my diplomatic correspondence, which in no\r\nway interrupts my literary composition, is entirely from my own hand.\r\n\r\nThe _Essai_ made a stir among the Emigration: it was opposed to the\r\nopinions of my companions in misfortune; in the different social\r\npositions which I have occupied, my independence has nearly always\r\noffended the men with whom I went. I have by turns been the leader of\r\ndifferent armies of which the soldiers did not belong to my side: I\r\nhave led the Old Royalists to the conquest of the public liberties, and\r\nespecially of the liberty of the press, which they detested; I have\r\nrallied the Liberals, in the name of that same liberty, to the standard\r\nof the Bourbons, whom they hold in abhorrence. As it happened, Emigrant\r\nopinion attached itself to my person through self-love: the English\r\nreviews having spoken of me with praise, the commendation was reflected\r\nover the whole body of the \"faithful.\"\r\n\r\nI had sent copies of the _Essai_ to La Harpe, Ginguené, and de\r\nSales. Lemierre[198], nephew of the poet of the same name[199], and\r\ntranslator of Gray's _Poems_, wrote to me from Paris, on the 15th of\r\nJuly 1797, that my _Essai_ had had the greatest success. One thing is\r\ncertain, that, if the _Essai_ became for a moment known, it was almost\r\nimmediately forgotten: a sudden shadow swallowed up the first ray of my\r\nglory.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Mrs. O'Larry.]\r\n\r\nAs I had become almost a personage, the upper Emigration began to seek\r\nme out in London. I made my way from street to street; I first left\r\nHolborn and Tottenham Court Road, and advanced as far as the Hampstead\r\nRoad. Here I stopped for some months at the house of Mrs. O'Larry, an\r\nIrish widow, the mother of a very pretty daughter of fourteen, and\r\ntenderly devoted to cats. Linked by this common passion, we had the\r\nmisfortune to lose two beautiful kittens, white all over, like two\r\nermines, with black tips to their tails.\r\n\r\nMrs. O'Larry was visited by old ladies of the neighbourhood with whom\r\nI was obliged to drink tea in the old-fashioned style. Madame de Staël\r\nhas depicted this scene in _Corinne_ at Lady Edgermond's:\r\n\r\n    \"'My dear, do you think the water has boiled long enough to\r\n    pour it on the tea?'\r\n\r\n    \"'My dear, I think it is a little too early[200].'\"\r\n\r\n\r\nThere also came to these evenings a tall and beautiful young\r\nIrishwoman, called Mary Neale, in the charge of her guardian. She\r\nnoticed a wound lurking in my gaze, for she said to me:\r\n\r\n\"You carry your heart in a sling.\"\r\n\r\nI carried my heart anyhow.\r\n\r\nMrs. O'Larry left for Dublin; then, moving once more from the\r\nneighbourhood of the colony of the poor Emigration of the east, I\r\narrived, from lodging to lodging, in the quarter of the rich Emigration\r\nof the west, among the bishops, the Court families, and the West\r\nIndian planters. Peltier had come back to me: he had got married as\r\na joke; he was the same boaster as always, lavishly obliging, and\r\nfrequenting his neighbours' pockets rather than their society. I made\r\nseveral new acquaintances, particularly in the society in which I had\r\nfamily connections: Christian de Lamoignon[201], who had been seriously\r\nwounded in the leg in the engagement at Quiberon, and who is now my\r\ncolleague in the House of Lords, became my friend. He presented me\r\nto Mrs. Lindsay, who was attached to Auguste de Lamoignon[202], his\r\nbrother: the Président Guillaume[203] was not installed in this fashion\r\nat Basville, in the midst of Boileau[204], Madame de Sévigné, and\r\nBourdaloue[205].\r\n\r\nMrs. Lindsay, a lady of Irish descent, with a material mind and a\r\nsomewhat snappish humour, an elegant figure and attractive features,\r\nwas gifted with nobility of soul and elevation of character: the\r\nEmigrants of quality spent their evenings by the fireside of the\r\nlast of the Ninons[206]. The old monarchy was going under, with all\r\nits abuses and all its graces. It will be dug up one day, like those\r\nskeletons of queens, decked with necklaces, bracelets and ear-rings,\r\nwhich they exhume in Etruria. At Mrs. Lindsay's I met M. Malouet[207]\r\nand Madame du Belloy, a woman worthy of affection, the Comte de\r\nMontlosier and the Chevalier de Panat[208]. The last had a well-earned\r\nreputation for wit, dirtiness, and gluttony; he belonged to that\r\naudience of men of taste who used formerly to sit with folded arms in\r\nthe presence of French society: idlers whose mission was to look on at\r\neverything and criticize everything; they exercised the functions which\r\nthe newspapers fulfill to-day, without the same bitterness, but also\r\nwithout attaining their great popular influence.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The Comte de Montlosier.]\r\n\r\nMontlosier continued to ride cock-horse on his famous phrase of the\r\n\"wooden cross,\" a phrase somewhat smoothed down by me, when I revived\r\nit, but true at bottom. On leaving France he went to Coblentz: he was\r\nbadly received by the Princes, had a quarrel, fought a duel at night on\r\nthe bank of the Rhine, and was run through. Being unable to move and\r\nquite unable to see, he asked the seconds if the point of the sword was\r\nsticking out behind:\r\n\r\n\"Only three inches,\" said they, feeling him.\r\n\r\n\"Then it's nothing,\" replied Montlosier. \"Sir, withdraw your weapon.\"\r\n\r\nThus badly received for his royalism, Montlosier went to England,\r\nand took refuge in literature, the great almshouse of the Emigrants,\r\nin which I had a pallet next to his. He obtained the editorship of\r\nthe _Courrier français._[209] In addition to his newspaper, he wrote\r\nphysico-politico-philosophical works: in one of these works he proved\r\nthat blue is the colour of life, because our veins turn blue after\r\ndeath, life coming to the surface of the body in order to evaporate and\r\nreturn to the blue sky; as I am very fond of blue, I was quite charmed.\r\n\r\nFeudally liberal, aristocratic and democratic, with a motley mind, made\r\nup of shreds and patches, Montlosier is delivered, with difficulty,\r\nof incongruous ideas; but, once he has succeeded in extricating them\r\nfrom their after-birth, they are sometimes fine, above all energetic:\r\nan anti-clerical as a noble, a Christian through sophistry and as a\r\nlover of the olden times, he would, in the days of paganism, have been\r\nan eager partisan of freedom in theory and of slavery in practice, and\r\nwould have had the slave thrown to the lampreys in the name of the\r\nliberty of the human race. Wrong-headed, cavilling, stiff-necked, and\r\nhirsute, the ex-deputy of the nobles of Riom nevertheless indulges\r\nin condescendences to the powers that be; he knows how to look after\r\nhis interests, but he does not suffer others to perceive this, and he\r\nshelters his weaknesses as a man beneath his honour as a gentleman. I\r\ndo not wish to speak ill of my \"smoky Auvernat,\" with his novels of the\r\n_Mont-d'Or_ and his polemics of the _Plaine_; I like his heteroclitous\r\nperson. His long and obscure setting forth and twisting of ideas, with\r\nparentheses, clearings of the throat, and tremulous \"oh, ohs,\" bore me\r\n(I abominate the tenebrous, the involved, the vaporous, the laborious);\r\nbut, on the other hand, I am amused by this naturalist of volcanoes,\r\nthis abortive Pascal, this mountain orator who holds forth in the\r\ntribune as his little fellow-countrymen sing in the chimney-tops[210];\r\nI love this gazetteer of peat-bogs and castle-keeps, this Liberal\r\nexplaining the Charter through a Gothic window, this shepherd-lord half\r\nmarried to his milkmaid, himself sowing his barley in the snow, in his\r\nlittle pebbly field; I shall always thank him for dedicating to me, in\r\nhis chalet in the Puy-de-Dôme, an old black rock taken from a cemetery\r\nof the Gauls discovered by himself.\r\n\r\nThe Abbé Delille, another fellow-countryman of Sidonius Apollinarius,\r\nof the Chancelier de l'Hospital, of La Fayette, of Thomas, of\r\nChamfort[211], had also come to settle in London, after being driven\r\nfrom the Continent by the inundation of the Republican victories.\r\nThe Emigration was proud to number him in its ranks: he sang our\r\nmisfortunes, a reason the more for loving his muse. He did a great deal\r\nof work; he could not help himself, for Madame Delille locked him up\r\nand did not release him until he had earned his day's keep by writing\r\na certain number of verses. I called on him one day, and was kept\r\nwaiting; then he appeared with very red cheeks: it is said that Madame\r\nDelille used to box his ears; I know nothing about it; I only say what\r\nI saw.\r\n\r\nWho has not heard the Abbé Delille recite his verses? He told a very\r\ngood story: his ugly, irregular features, lit up by his imagination,\r\nwent admirably with his affected delivery, with the character of\r\nhis talent, and with his clerical profession. The Abbé Delille's\r\nmasterpiece is his translation of the _Georgics_, with the exception\r\nof the sentimental pieces; but it is as though you were reading Racine\r\ntranslated into the language of Louis XV.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The Abbé Delille.]\r\n\r\nThe literature of the eighteenth century, saving a few fine talents\r\nwhich dominate it, standing as it does between the classical literature\r\nof the seventeenth century and the romantic literature of the\r\nnineteenth, without lacking naturalness lacks nature; given up wholly\r\nto arrangements of words, it was neither sufficiently original as a new\r\nschool, nor sufficiently pure as an ancient school. The Abbé Delille\r\nwas the poet of the modern country-houses, in the same way as the\r\ntroubadours were the poets of the old castles; the verses of the one\r\nand the ballads of the other point the difference which existed between\r\naristocracy in its prime and aristocracy in its decrepitude: the abbé\r\ndescribes the pleasures of reading and chess in the manor-houses in\r\nwhich the troubadours sang of tourneys and crusades.\r\n\r\nThe distinguished persons of our Church militant were at that time in\r\nEngland: the Abbé Carron, who wrote the life of my sister Julie; the\r\nBishop of Saint-Pol-de-Léon[212], a stern and narrow-minded prelate,\r\nwho contributed more and more to estrange M. le Comte d'Artois from his\r\ncountry; the Archbishop of Aix[213], slandered perhaps because of his\r\nsuccess in society; another learned and pious bishop, but so avaricious\r\nthat, had he had the misfortune to lose his soul, he would never have\r\nbought it back. Nearly all misers are men of wit: I must be a great\r\nfool.\r\n\r\nAmong the Frenchwomen in the West End was Madame de Boigne[214],\r\namiable, witty, filled with talent, extremely pretty, and the youngest\r\nof them all; she has since, together with her father, the Marquis\r\nd'Osmond[215], represented the Court of France in England much better\r\nthan my unsociability has done. She is writing now, and her talents\r\nwill reproduce admirably all that she has seen[216].\r\n\r\nMesdames de Caumont[217], de Gontaut[218], and du Cluzel also\r\ninhabited the quarter of the exiled felicities, if at least I am\r\nmistaking Madame de Caumont and Madame du Cluzel, both of whom I had\r\nseen for a moment in Brussels. What is quite certain is that Madame la\r\nDuchesse de Duras[219] was in London at that time: I was not to know\r\nher till ten years later. How often in one's life one passes by that\r\nwhich would constitute its charm, even as the navigator cuts through\r\nthe waters of a heaven-favoured land which he has only missed by one\r\nhorizon and one day's sail! I am writing this on the banks of the\r\nThames, and to-day a letter will go by post to tell Madame de Duras, on\r\nthe banks of the Seine, that I have come across my first memory of her.\r\n\r\n*\r\n\r\nFrom time to time the Revolution sent us Emigrants of new kinds and\r\nopinions; different layers of exiles were formed: the earth contains\r\nbeds of sand or clay left behind by the waves of the Deluge. One of\r\nthose waves brought me a man whose loss I mourn to-day, a man who\r\nwas my guide in literature, and whose friendship was both one of the\r\nhonours and one of the consolations of my life.\r\n\r\nYou have read, in an earlier book of these Memoirs, that I had known\r\nM. de Fontanes in 1789: it was in Berlin, last year, that I learnt\r\nthe news of his death. He was born at Niort of a noble Protestant\r\nfamily: his father had had the misfortune to kill his brother-in-law\r\nin a duel. Young Fontanes, brought up by a brother of great merit,\r\ncame to Paris. He saw Voltaire[220] die, and that great representative\r\nof the eighteenth century inspired his first verses: his poetic\r\nattempts attracted the notice of La Harpe. He undertook some work for\r\nthe stage, and became intimate with a charming actress, Mademoiselle\r\nDesgarcins. Living near the Odéon, wandering around the Chartreuse\r\nhe celebrated its solitude. He had made a friend destined to become\r\nmine, M. Joubert[221]. When the Revolution occurred, the poet became\r\nentangled with one of those stationary parties which always remain\r\ntorn by the progressive party which pulls them forwards and the\r\nretrograde party which draws them back. The monarchists attached M. de\r\nFontanes to the staff of the _Modérateur._ When the bad days began,\r\nhe took refuge at Lyons, where he married. His wife was confined of\r\na son: during the siege of the town, which the revolutionaries had\r\ncalled \"Commune-Affranchie[222],\" in the same way as Louis XI., when\r\nbanishing the citizens, had called Arras \"Ville-Franchise[223],\" Madame\r\nde Fontanes was obliged to move her nursling's cradle in order to\r\nplace it within shelter from the bombs. Returning to Paris after the 9\r\nThermidor, M. de Fontanes established the _Mémorial_[224] with M. de\r\nLa Harpe and the Abbé de Vauxelles[225]. He was proscribed on the 18\r\nFructidor, and England became his haven of refuge.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The Marquis de Fontanes.]\r\n\r\nM. de Fontanes, together with Chénier, was the last writer of the\r\nclassic school in the elder line: his prose and verse resemble each\r\nother and have a similar merit. His thoughts and images have a\r\nmelancholy unknown to the century of Louis XIV., which knew only the\r\naustere and holy sadness of religious eloquence. That melancholy is\r\nmingled with the works of the chanter of the _Jours des Morts_, as it\r\nwere the imprint of the period in which he lived: it fixes the date of\r\nhis coming; it shows that he was born after Rousseau, while connected\r\nby taste with Fénelon. If the writings of M. de Fontanes were reduced\r\nto two very small volumes, one of prose, the other of verse, it would\r\nbe the most graceful funeral monument that could be raised upon the\r\ntomb of the classic school[226].\r\n\r\nAmong the papers which my friend left are several cantoes of his poem\r\nof the _Grèce Sauvée_, books of odes, scattered poems, and so on.\r\nHe would not have published any more himself: for that critic, so\r\nacute, so enlightened, so impartial when not blinded by his political\r\nopinions, had a horrible dread of criticism. He was superlatively\r\nunjust to Madame de Staël. An envious article by Garat[227] on the\r\n_Forêt de Navarre_ almost stopped him short at the outset of his\r\npolitical career. Fontanes, so soon as he appeared, killed the affected\r\nschool of Dorat[228], but he was unable to restore the classic\r\nschool, which was hastening to its end together with the language of\r\nRacine[229].\r\n\r\nIf one thing in the world was likely to be antipathetic to M. de\r\nFontanes, it was my manner of writing. With me began the so-called\r\nromantic school, a revolution in French literature: nevertheless, my\r\nfriend, instead of revolting against my barbarism, became enamoured\r\nof it. I could see a great wonderment on his face when I read to him\r\nfragments of the _Natchez, Atala_ and _René_; he was unable to bring\r\nthose productions within the scope of the common rules of criticism,\r\nbut he felt that he was entering into a new world; he saw a new form of\r\nnature; he understood a language which he could not speak. He gave me\r\nexcellent advice; I owe to him such correctness of style as I possess;\r\nhe taught me to respect the reader's ear; he prevented me from falling\r\ninto the extravagance of invention and the ruggedness of execution of\r\nmy disciples.\r\n\r\nIt was a great joy to me to see him again in London, received with open\r\narms by the Emigration; they asked him for cantoes from the _Grèce\r\nSauvée_; they crowded to hear him. He came to live near me; we became\r\ninseparable. We were present together at a scene worthy of those\r\ndays of misfortune: Cléry[230], who had lately landed, read us his\r\nMemoirs in manuscript. Imagine the emotion of an audience of exiles,\r\nlistening to the valet of Louis XVI. telling, as an eye-witness, of\r\nthe sufferings and death of the prisoner of the Temple! The Directory,\r\nalarmed by Cléry's Memoirs, published an interpolated edition, in\r\nwhich it made the author talk like a lackey and Louis XVI. like\r\na street-porter: this is, perhaps, one of the dirtiest of all the\r\ninstances of revolutionary turpitude.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Emigrant society.]\r\n\r\nM. du Theil[231], who had charge of the affairs of M. le Comte d'Artois\r\nin London, had hastened to seek out Fontanes; the latter asked me\r\nto take him to the agent of the Princes. We found him surrounded by\r\nall the defenders of the Throne and the Altar who were idling about\r\nPiccadilly, by a crowd of spies and sharpers who had escaped from Paris\r\nunder various names and disguises, and by a swarm of adventurers,\r\nBelgians, Germans, Irishmen, dealers in the Counter-revolution. In a\r\ncorner of the crowd was a man of thirty or thirty-two, at whom nobody\r\nlooked, and who himself seemed interested only in an engraving of the\r\nDeath of General Wolfe. Struck by his appearance, I asked who he was:\r\none of my neighbours answered:\r\n\r\n\"It's nobody; it's a Vendean peasant who has brought a letter from his\r\nleaders.\"\r\n\r\nThis man, who was \"nobody,\" had seen the deaths of Cathelineau[232],\r\nthe first general of the Vendée and a peasant like himself; Bonchamps,\r\nin whom Bayard had come to life again; Lescure[233], armed with a\r\nhair-cloth which was not bullet-proof; d'Elbée[234], shot in an\r\narmchair, his wounds not permitting him to embrace death standing; La\r\nRochejacquelein[235], whose body was ordered to be \"verified\" in order\r\nto reassure the Convention in the midst of its victories. That man,\r\nwho was \"nobody,\" had assisted at two hundred captures and recaptures\r\nof towns, villages, and redoubts, at seven hundred skirmishes, and\r\nseventeen pitched battles; he had fought against three hundred thousand\r\nregular troops and six or seven hundred thousand recruits and national\r\nguards; he had assisted in taking one hundred guns and fifty thousand\r\nmuskets; he had passed through the \"infernal columns,\" companies of\r\nincendiaries commanded by Conventional; he had been in the midst of\r\nthe ocean of fire which, three several times, rolled its waves over\r\nthe woods of the Vendée; lastly, he had seen three hundred thousand\r\nHercules of the plough, the associates of his work, die, and one\r\nhundred square leagues of fertile country change into a desert of ashes.\r\n\r\nThe two Frances met upon this soil levelled by them. All that remained\r\nin blood and memory of the France of the Crusades fought against the\r\nnew blood and hopes of the France of the Revolution. The conqueror\r\nrecognised the greatness of the conquered. Turreau[236], the Republican\r\ngeneral, declared that \"the Vendeans would take their place in history\r\nin the first rank of soldier peoples.\" Another general wrote to Merlin\r\nde Thionville[237]:\r\n\r\n\"Troops which have beaten such Frenchmen as those may well hope to beat\r\nall other nations.\"\r\n\r\nThe legions of Probus[238], in their song, said as much of our fathers.\r\nBonaparte called the combats of the Vendée \"combats of giants.\"\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: A Vendean peasant.]\r\n\r\nIn the crowd in the parlour, I was the only one to look with admiration\r\nand respect upon the representative of those ancient \"Jacques[239],\"\r\nwho, while breaking the yoke of their lords, repelled the foreign\r\ninvasion under Charles V.[240]: I seemed to see a child of the Commons\r\nof the time of Charles VII.[241], who, with the small provincial\r\nnobility, foot by foot, furrow by furrow, reconquered the soil of\r\nFrance. He wore the indifferent air of the savage; his look was grey\r\nand inflexible as steel rod; his lower lip trembled over his clenched\r\nteeth; his hair hung down from his head like a mass of torpid snakes,\r\nready, however, to dart erect again; his arms, hanging by his sides,\r\ngave nervous jerks to a pair of huge fists slashed with sword-cuts:\r\none would have taken him for a sawyer. His physiognomy expressed a\r\nhomely, rustic nature, employed, by force of manners, in the service\r\nof interests and ideas contrary to that nature; the native fidelity of\r\nthe vassal, the Christian's simple faith were mingled with the rough\r\nplebeian independence accustomed to value itself and to take the law\r\ninto its own hands. The feeling of liberty in him seemed to be merely\r\nthe consciousness of the strength of his hand and the intrepidity of\r\nhis heart. He spoke no more than a lion; he scratched himself like\r\na lion, yawned like a lion, sat on his flank like a bored lion, and\r\nseemed to dream of blood and forests.\r\n\r\nWhat men, in every party, were the French of that time, and what a race\r\nare we to-day! But the Republicans had their principle in themselves,\r\nin the midst of themselves, while the principle of the Royalists was\r\noutside France. The Vendeans sent deputations to the exiles; the giants\r\nsent to ask leaders of the pigmies. The rude messenger upon whom I\r\ngazed had seized the Revolution by the throat and cried:\r\n\r\n\"Enter; pass behind me; she will not hurt you; she shall not move; I\r\nhave got hold of her!\"\r\n\r\nNo one was willing to pass: then Jacques Bonhomme let go the\r\nRevolution, and Charette[242] broke his sword.\r\n\r\n*\r\n\r\nWhile I was making these reflections on this tiller of the soil, as\r\nI had made others of a different kind at the sight of Mirabeau and\r\nDanton, Fontanes obtained a private audience of him whom he pleasantly\r\ncalled \"the controller-general of finance:\" he came out of it greatly\r\nsatisfied, for M. du Theil had promised to encourage the publication of\r\nmy works, and Fontanes thought only of me. It was impossible to be a\r\nbetter man than he: timid where he himself was concerned, he became all\r\ncourage in matters of friendship; he proved this to me at the time of\r\nmy resignation on the occasion of the death of the Duc d'Enghien[243].\r\nIn conversation, he burst into ludicrous fits of literary rage. In\r\npolitics, he reasoned falsely: the crimes of the Convention had\r\ninspired him with a horror of liberty. He detested the newspapers,\r\nthe band of false philosophers, the whole science of ideas, and he\r\ncommunicated that hatred to Bonaparte, when he became connected with\r\nthe master of Europe.\r\n\r\nWe went for walks in the country; we stopped under some of those\r\nspreading elm-trees scattered about the fields. Leaning against the\r\ntrunk of these elms, my friend told me of his early journey to England\r\nbefore the Revolution, and of the verses he then addressed to two young\r\nladies who had grown old in the shadow of the towers of Westminster:\r\ntowers which he found standing as he had left them, while at their base\r\nlay buried the illusions and the hours of his youth.\r\n\r\nWe often dined at some solitary tavern in Chelsea, on the Thames, where\r\nwe talked of Milton and Shakespeare: they had seen what we saw; they\r\nhad sat, like ourselves, on the bank of that stream, a foreign stream\r\nto us, the national stream to them. We returned to London, at night, by\r\nthe faltering rays of the stars, drowned one after the other in the fog\r\nof the city. We reached our lodging, guided by uncertain glimmers which\r\nscarcely showed us the road across the coal smoke hovering red around\r\nevery lamp: thus speeds the poet's life.\r\n\r\nWe saw London in detail; as an old exile, I acted as _cicerone_ to\r\nthe new recruits of banishment which the Revolution demanded, young\r\nor old: there is no legal age for misfortune. In the course of one\r\nof these excursions, we were surprised by a rain-storm, mingled with\r\nthunder, and obliged to take shelter in the passage of a mean house,\r\nof which the door had been left open by accident. There we met the Duc\r\nde Bourbon[244]: I saw for the first time, at this Chantilly[245], a\r\nprince who was not yet the Last of the Condés.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The Duc of Bourbon.]\r\n\r\nThe Duc de Bourbon, Fontanes and I, all three outlaws, seeking a\r\nshelter from the same storm, on foreign soil, under a poor man's roof!\r\n_Fata viam invenient._\r\n\r\nFontanes was recalled to France. He embraced me, expressing wishes for\r\na speedy meeting. On arriving in Germany, he wrote me the following\r\nletter:\r\n\r\n    \"28 July 1798.\r\n\r\n    \"If you have experienced any regrets at my departure from\r\n    London, I swear to you that mine have been no less real. You\r\n    are the second person in whom, in the course of my life, I\r\n    have found an imagination and a heart corresponding to my\r\n    own. I shall never forget the consolation you brought me in\r\n    exile and in a foreign land. My fondest and most constant\r\n    thoughts, since I have left you, have turned upon the\r\n    Natchez. What you have read to me, especially of recent days,\r\n    is admirable and will not leave my memory. But the charm of\r\n    the poetic ideas which you left in my mind disappeared for a\r\n    moment on my arrival in Germany.\r\n\r\n    \"The most hideous news from France followed on that which I\r\n    showed you on leaving you. I spent five or six days in the\r\n    cruellest perplexity. I even feared for persecutions directed\r\n    against my family. My fears are now greatly diminished. The\r\n    evil has even been very slight; they threaten rather than\r\n    strike, and it is not those of my 'date' whom they wish to\r\n    see exterminated. The last post has brought me assurances of\r\n    peace and good-will. I can continue my journey, and shall\r\n    set out early next month. I shall live near the Forest of\r\n    Saint-Germain, among my family, Greece, and my books: why\r\n    can I not also say the _Natchez!_ The unexpected storm which\r\n    has just taken place in Paris was due, I am certain, to the\r\n    follies of the agents and leaders you know of. I have a\r\n    clear proof of this in my hands. Convinced as I am of this,\r\n    I am writing to Great Pulteney Street[246] with all possible\r\n    politeness, but also with all the caution which prudence\r\n    demands. I wish to escape all correspondence in the coming\r\n    month, and I leave the greatest doubt upon the steps which I\r\n    am going to take and the residence which I intend to select.\r\n\r\n    \"For the rest, I am again speaking of you in the accents of\r\n    friendship, and I wish from the bottom of my heart that the\r\n    hopes of future usefulness which they may place in me may\r\n    revive the favourable dispositions which they showed me in\r\n    this matter, and which are so certainly due to your person\r\n    and your great talents. Work, work, my dear friend, and\r\n    become illustrious. You have it in your power: the future\r\n    is in your hands. I hope that the word so often given by\r\n    the 'controller-general of finance' has been at least in\r\n    part redeemed. That part consoles me, for I cannot bear the\r\n    thought of a fine work delayed for the sake of a little\r\n    assistance. Write to me; let our hearts be in communication,\r\n    let our muses remain ever friends. Do not doubt but that,\r\n    when I am able to move about freely in my country, I shall\r\n    prepare a hive and flowers for you beside my own. My\r\n    attachment is unalterable. I shall be alone so long as I am\r\n    not with you. Talk to me of your work. I want to gladden you\r\n    in conclusion: I wrote half of a new canto on the banks of\r\n    the Elbe, and I am better pleased with it than with all the\r\n    rest.\r\n\r\n    \"Farewell, I embrace you tenderly, and am your friend.\r\n\r\n    \"FONTANES.\"\r\n\r\nFontanes tells me that he wrote verses on changing the spot of his\r\nbanishment. One can never take everything from the poet: he takes his\r\nlyre with him. Leave the swan his wings; each evening unknown streams\r\nwill re-echo the melodious plaints which he would rather have sung to\r\nEurotas.\r\n\r\n\"The future is in your hands\": did Fontanes speak truly? Am I to\r\ncongratulate myself on his prophecy? Alas! That promised future is\r\nalready past: shall I have another?\r\n\r\n*\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Death of Fontanes.]\r\n\r\nThis first and affectionate letter from the first friend whom I had in\r\nmy life, the friend who walked by my side for twenty-three years from\r\nthe date of that letter, reminds me painfully of my gradual isolation.\r\nFontanes is no more; a profound sorrow, the tragic death of a son,\r\ncast him into an untimely grave. Almost all the persons of whom I have\r\nspoken in these Memoirs have disappeared; I am keeping an obituary\r\nregister. A few years more and I, doomed to catalogue the dead, shall\r\nleave none to write my name in the book of the departed.\r\n\r\nBut if it must be that I remain alone, if not one being who has loved\r\nme is to stay by me to lead me to my last resting-place, I have less\r\nneed than another of a guide: I have inquired the road, I have studied\r\nthe places through which I should have to pass; I wished to see what\r\nhappens at the last moment. Often, by the side of a pit into which a\r\ncoffin was being lowered with ropes, I have heard the death-rattle of\r\nthose ropes; next, I have caught the sound of the first spadeful of\r\nearth falling on the coffin: at each new spadeful the hollow sound\r\ndecreased; the earth, as it filled up the vault, gradually drove the\r\neternal silence to the surface of the grave.\r\n\r\nFontanes, you wrote to me, \"Let our muses remain ever friends:\" you\r\nhave not written to me in vain.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[146] This book was written in London between April and September 1822,\r\nand revised in December 1846.--T.\r\n\r\n[147] The anniversary dinner at the Freemasons' Tavern, 21 May 1822.--T.\r\n\r\n[148] The amount of M. de Chateaubriand's donation was £20.--T.\r\n\r\n[149] Field-Marshal Frederick Duke of York and Albany, Bishop\r\nof Osnaburg, K.G.

In 1823 King Louis XVIII. created him heir-presumptive to his\r\nuncle's peerage. In 1830 he resigned his commission at the same time\r\nthat his uncle withdrew from the House of Peers. In 1870, when eighty\r\nyears of age, he refused to leave Paris, and inscribed his name on\r\nthe register of the defenders of the besieged capital.

His Memoirs\r\nwere published in London, in 1799; with the title. _Journal de ce qui\r\ns'est passé à la Tour du Temple pendant la captivité de Louis XVI., roi\r\nde France_, and printed the same year in France. In order to destroy\r\nthe interest attached to this publication, the Directory caused a\r\nspurious edition to be disseminated, entitled _Mémoires de M. Cléry\r\nsur la détention de Louis XVI._, and filled with matter calculated to\r\ninjure the memory of the unhappy Sovereign and the Royal Family. Cléry\r\nprotested against this with indignation so soon as it reached his\r\nears, his protest appearing in July 1801 in the _Spectateur du Nord_,\r\npublished in Hamburg.--B.\r\n\r\n[231] Jean François du Theil (_circa_ 1760-1822) emigrated in 1790,\r\nreturned to France in 1792, during the captivity of Louis XVI., and\r\nexposed himself to the greatest dangers in order to communicate with\r\nthe King. After escaping arrest, almost by a miracle, inside the Temple\r\nitself, he returned to Germany, where he joined the Comte d'Artois.

He succeeded Cathelineau as\r\ngeneral-in-chief, but was a far from capable commander. He was wounded\r\nat Chollet, and captured and shot on the island of Noirmoutiers.--T.\r\n\r\n[235] Henri du Vergier, Comte de La Rochejacquelein (1773-1794)\r\nsucceeded Lescure and repeatedly defeated the troops of the Republic.\r\nHe was killed at the fight of Nouaillé, near Chollet, 4 March 1794.--T.\r\n\r\n[236] Louis Marie Baron Turreau de Garambouville (1756-1816),\r\nCommander-in-Chief of the Army of the West (1793).

Discords broke out between the Royalist\r\nchiefs, and Charette left the army with his division and fought alone,\r\ncapturing the Republican camp at Saint-Christophe, near Challans, in\r\n1794. In 1796, Hoche utterly destroyed his small force, and Charette\r\nhimself was taken prisoner and shot at Nantes.--T.\r\n\r\n[243] Louis Antoine Henri de Bourbon-Condé, Duc d'Enghien (1772-1804),\r\nson of the Duc de Bourbon and grandson of the Prince de Condé.

At certe semper amabo[248].\r\n\r\n\r\nI have just taken leave of a friend, I am about to take leave of\r\na mother: one has constantly to repeat the verses which Catullus\r\naddressed to his brother. In our vale of tears, as in Hell, there\r\nis a strange, eternal wailing, which forms the accompaniment or the\r\nprevailing note of human lamentations; it is heard unceasingly, and it\r\nwould continue when all other created sorrows had come to be silent.\r\n\r\nA letter from Julie, which I received soon after that from Fontanes,\r\nconfirmed my sad remark on my gradual isolation: Fontanes urged me\r\nto \"work, to become illustrious;\" my sister begged me to \"give up\r\nwriting:\" one put glory before me, the other oblivion. This train of\r\nthought is described in the story of Madame de Farcy; she had grown to\r\nhate literature, because she regarded it as one of the temptations of\r\nher life.\r\n\r\n    \"SAINT-SERVAN, 1 _July_ 1798.\r\n\r\n    \"Dear, we have just lost the best of mothers: I grieve to\r\n    inform you of this fatal blow. When you cease to be the\r\n    object of our solicitude, we shall have ceased to live. If\r\n    you knew how many tears your errors had caused our venerable\r\n    mother to shed; how deplorable they appear to all who think\r\n    and profess not only piety, but reason: if you knew this,\r\n    perhaps it would help to open your eyes, to induce you\r\n    to give up writing; and if Heaven, moved by our prayers,\r\n    permitted us to meet again, you would find in the midst of us\r\n    all the happiness one is allowed on earth; you would give us\r\n    that happiness, for there is none for us so long as you are\r\n    not with us and we have cause to be anxious as to your fate.\"\r\n\r\nAh, why did I not follow my sister's advice? Why did I continue to\r\nwrite? Had my age remained without my writings, would anything have\r\nbeen changed in the events and spirit of that age?\r\n\r\nAnd so I had lost my mother; and so I had distressed the last hour\r\nof her life! While she was drawing her last breath far from her last\r\nson, and praying for him, what was I doing in London? Perhaps I was\r\nstrolling in the cool morning air at the moment when the sweat of death\r\ncovered my mother's forehead without having my hand to wipe it away!\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The _Génie du Christianisme._]\r\n\r\nThe filial affection which I preserved for Madame de Chateaubriand was\r\ndeep. My childhood and youth were intimately linked with the memory\r\nof my mother. The idea that I had poisoned the old days of the woman\r\nwho bore me in her womb filled me with despair: I flung copies of the\r\n_Essai_ into the fire with horror, as the instrument of my crime;\r\nhad it been possible for me to destroy the whole work, I should have\r\ndone so without hesitation. I did not recover from my distress until\r\nthe thought occurred to me of expiating my first work by means of a\r\nreligious work: this was the origin of the _Génie du Christianisme._\r\n\r\n*\r\n\r\n\"My mother,\" I said, in the first preface to that work, \"after being\r\nflung, at the age of seventy-two years, into dungeons where she saw\r\npart of her children die, expired at last on a pallet to which her\r\nmisfortunes had reduced her. The recollection of my errors cast a\r\ngreat bitterness over her last days; when dying, she charged one of\r\nmy sisters to call me back to the religion in which I was brought up.\r\nMy sister acquainted me with my mother's last wish. When the letter\r\nreached me across the sea, my sister herself was no more; she too had\r\ndied from the effects of her imprisonment. Those two voices from the\r\ntomb, that death which acted as death's interpreter impressed me. I\r\nbecame a Christian. I did not yield, I admit, to great supernatural\r\nenlightenment: my conviction came from the heart; I wept and I\r\nbelieved.\"\r\n\r\n*\r\n\r\nI exaggerated my fault: the _Essai_ was not an impious book, but a book\r\nof doubt, of sorrow. Through the darkness of that book glides a ray\r\nof the Christian light that shone upon my cradle. It needed no great\r\neffort to return from the scepticism of the _Essai_ to the certainty of\r\nthe _Génie du Christianisme._\r\n\r\n*\r\n\r\nWhen, after receiving the sad news of Madame de Chateaubriand's death,\r\nI resolved suddenly to change my course, the title of _Génie du\r\nChristianisme_, which I found on the spot, inspired me: I set to work;\r\nI toiled with the ardour of a son building a mausoleum to his mother.\r\nMy materials were since long collected and rough-hewn by my previous\r\nstudies. I knew the works of the Fathers better than they are known in\r\nour times; I had even studied them in order to oppugn them, and having\r\nentered upon that road with bad intentions, instead of leaving it as a\r\nvictor, I left it vanquished.\r\n\r\nAs to history properly so-called, I had occupied myself with it\r\nspecially in composing the _Essai sur les Révolutions._ The Camden\r\noriginals which I had lately examined had made me familiar with the\r\nmanners and institutions of the Middle Ages. Lastly, my terrible\r\nmanuscript of the _Natchez_, in 2393 pages folio, contained all that I\r\nneeded for the _Génie du Christianisme_ in the way of descriptions of\r\nnature; I was able to draw largely upon that source, as I had done for\r\nthe _Essai_.\r\n\r\nI wrote the first part of the _Génie du Christianisme._ Messrs.\r\nDulau[249], who had become the booksellers of the French emigrant\r\nclergy, undertook the publication. The first sheets of the first volume\r\nwere printed. The work thus begun in London in 1799 was completed\r\nonly in Paris in 1802: see the different prefaces to the _Génie du\r\nChristianisme._ I was devoured by a sort of fever during the whole\r\ntime of writing: no one will ever know what it means to carry at the\r\nsame time in one's brain, in one's blood, and in one's soul, _Atala_\r\nand _René_, and to combine with the painful child-birth of those fiery\r\ntwins the labour of conception attending the other parts of the _Génie\r\ndu Christianisme._ The memory of Charlotte penetrated and warmed all\r\nthat, and to give me the finishing stroke, the first longing for fame\r\ninflamed my exalted imagination.\r\n\r\nThis longing came to me from filial affection: I wanted a great renown,\r\nso that it might rise till it reached my mother's dwelling-place, and\r\nthat the angels might carry her my solemn expiation.\r\n\r\nAs one study leads to another, I could not occupy myself with my French\r\nscholia without taking note of the literature and men of the country\r\nin which I lived: I was drawn into these fresh researches. My days and\r\nnights were spent in reading, in writing, in taking lessons in Hebrew\r\nfrom a learned priest, the Abbé Capelan, in consulting libraries and\r\nmen of attainments, in roaming about the fields with my everlasting\r\nreveries, in paying and receiving visits. If such things exist as\r\nretroactive and symptomatic effects of future events, I might have\r\nforeseen the bustle and uproar created by the book which was to make my\r\nname from the seething of my mind and the throbbing of my inner muse.\r\n\r\nReading aloud to others my first rough drafts helped to enlighten\r\nme. Reading aloud is an excellent form of instruction, when one does\r\nnot take the necessary compliments for gospel. Provided an author\r\nbe in earnest, he will soon feel, through the impression which he\r\ninstinctively receives from the others, which are the weak places in\r\nhis work, and especially whether that work is too long or too short,\r\nwhether he keeps, does not reach, or exceeds the right dimensions.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: A letter from Panat.]\r\n\r\nI have discovered a letter from the Chevalier de Panat on the readings\r\nfrom a work at that time so unknown. The letter is charming: the dirty\r\nchevalier's positive and scoffing spirit did not seem susceptible of\r\nthus rubbing itself with poetry. I have no hesitation in giving this\r\nletter, a document of my history, although it is stained from end to\r\nend with my praises, as though the sly author had taken pleasure in\r\nemptying his ink-pot over his epistle:\r\n\r\n    \"_Monday._\r\n\r\n    \"Heavens, what an interesting reading I owed to your extreme\r\n    kindness this morning! Our religion had numbered among\r\n    its defenders great geniuses, illustrious Fathers of the\r\n    Church: those athletes had wielded with vigour all the arms\r\n    of reasoning; incredulity was vanquished; but that was not\r\n    enough: it was still necessary to show all the charms of\r\n    that admirable religion; it was necessary to show how suited\r\n    it is to the human heart and what magnificent pictures it\r\n    offers to the imagination. It is no longer a theologian in\r\n    the school, it is the great painter and the man sensitive to\r\n    impressions who open up a new horizon for themselves. Your\r\n    work was wanted, and you were called upon to write it. Nature\r\n    has eminently endowed you with the great qualities which this\r\n    work requires: you belong to another age....\r\n\r\n    \"Ah, if the truths of sentiment rank first in the order of\r\n    nature, none will have proved better than yourself those of\r\n    our religion; you will have confounded the unbelievers at the\r\n    gate of the Temple and introduced delicate minds and sensible\r\n    hearts into the sanctuaries. You bring back to me those\r\n    ancient philosophers who gave their lessons with their heads\r\n    crowned with flowers, their hands filled with sweet perfumes.\r\n    This is a very feeble image of your suave, pure and classic\r\n    mind.\r\n\r\n    \"I congratulate myself daily on the happy circumstance which\r\n    made me acquainted with you; I can never forget that it was\r\n    Fontanes who did me that kindness; I shall love him for it\r\n    the more, and my heart will never separate two names whom the\r\n    same glory is bound to unite, if Providence re-opens to us\r\n    the doors of our native land.\r\n\r\n    \"CHEV. DE PANAT.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Abbé Delille also heard some fragments of the _Génie du\r\nChristianisme_ read. He seemed surprised, and did me the honour,\r\nsoon after, to put into verse the prose which had pleased him. He\r\nnaturalized my wild American flowers in his various French gardens, and\r\nput my somewhat hot wine to cool in the frigid water from his clear\r\nspring.\r\n\r\nThe unfinished edition of the _Génie du Christianisme_, commenced in\r\nLondon, was a little different, in the order of the contents, from the\r\nedition published in France. The consular censure, which soon became\r\nimperial, showed itself very touchy on the subject of kings: their\r\npersons, their honour and their virtue were dear to it beforehand.\r\nAlready Fouché's police saw the white pigeon, the symbol of Bonaparte's\r\ncandour and revolutionary innocence, descend from Heaven with the\r\nsacred phial. The true believers who had taken part in the Republican\r\nprocessions of Lyons compelled me to cut out a chapter entitled the\r\n_Rois athées_, and to distribute paragraphs from it here and there in\r\nthe body of the work.\r\n\r\n*\r\n\r\nBefore continuing these literary investigations I must interrupt\r\nthem for a moment to take leave of my uncle de Bedée; alas, that\r\nmeans taking leave of the first joy of my life: _freno non remorante\r\ndies_[250]! See the old sepulchres in the old crypts: themselves\r\novercome by age, decrepit and without memory, having lost their\r\nepitaphs, they have forgotten the very names of those whose ashes they\r\ncontain.\r\n\r\nI had written to my uncle on the subject of my mother's death: he\r\nreplied with a long letter containing some touching words of regret;\r\nbut three-quarters of his double folio sheet were devoted to my\r\ngenealogy. He begged me above all, when I should return to France,\r\nto look up the title-deeds of the \"Bedée quartering,\" entrusted to\r\nmy brother. And so, to this venerable Emigrant, exile, ruin, the\r\ndestruction of his kin, the sacrifice of Louis XVI. alike failed to\r\nmake the fact of the Revolution clear to him; nothing had happened,\r\nnothing come to pass; he had gone no farther than the States of\r\nBrittany and the Assembly of the Nobles. This fixity of ideas in man is\r\nvery striking in the midst and as it were in presence of the alteration\r\nof his body, the flight of his years, the loss of his relations and\r\nfriends.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Death of my uncle de Bedée.]\r\n\r\nOn his return from the Emigration, my uncle de Bedée went to live at\r\nDinan, where he died, six leagues from Monchoix, without having seen it\r\nagain. My cousin Caroline[251], the oldest of my three cousins, still\r\nlives. She has remained an old maid in spite of the formal requests\r\nfor her hand made in her former youth. She writes me letters, badly\r\nspelt, in which she addresses me in the second person singular, calls\r\nme \"chevalier,\" and talks to me of our good time: _in illo tempore._\r\nShe was endowed with a pair of fine dark eyes and a comely figure; she\r\ndanced like the Camargo[252], and she seems to recollect that I bore\r\na fierce passion for her in secret. I reply in the same tone, laying\r\naside, in imitation of her, my years, my honours and my reputation:\r\n\r\n\"Yes, dear Caroline, your chevalier,\" etc.\r\n\r\nIt must be some six or seven lustres since we met: Heaven be praised\r\nfor it, for God alone knows, if we came to embracing, what kind of\r\nfigure we should cut in each other's eyes!\r\n\r\nSweet, patriarchal, innocent, creditable family friendship, your age\r\nis past! We no longer cling to the soil by a multitude of blossoms,\r\nsprouts and roots; we are born and die singly nowadays. The living\r\nare in haste to fling the deceased to Eternity, and to be rid of his\r\ncorpse. Of his friends, some go and await the coffin at the church,\r\ngrumbling the while at being put out and disturbed in their habits;\r\nothers carry their devotion so far as to follow the funeral to the\r\ncemetery: the grave once filled up, all recollection is obliterated.\r\nYou will never return, O days of religion and affection, in which the\r\nson died in the same house, in the same arm-chair, by the same fireside\r\nwhere died his father and his grandfather before him, surrounded, as\r\nthey had been, by weeping children and grandchildren, upon whom fell\r\nthe last paternal blessing!\r\n\r\nFarewell, my beloved uncle! Farewell, family of my mother, which are\r\ndisappearing like the other portion of my family! Farewell, my cousin\r\nof days long past, who love me still as you loved me when we listened\r\ntogether to our kind aunt de Boistelleul's ballad of the Sparrow-hawk,\r\nor when you assisted at my release from my nurse's vow at the Abbey\r\nof Nazareth! If you survive me, accept the share of gratitude and\r\naffection which I here bequeath to you. Attach no belief to the false\r\nsmile outlined on my lips in speaking of you: my eyes, I assure you,\r\nare full of tears.\r\n\r\n*\r\n\r\nMy studies correlative to the _Génie du Christianisme_ had gradually,\r\nas I have said, led me to make a more thorough examination of English\r\nliterature. When I took refuge in England in 1793, it became necessary\r\nfor me to redress most of the judgments which I had drawn from the\r\ncriticisms. As regards the historians, Hume[253] was reputed a Tory\r\nand reactionary writer: he was accused, as was Gibbon, of over-loading\r\nthe English language with gallicisms; people preferred his continuer,\r\nSmollett[254]. Gibbon[255], a philosopher during his lifetime, became a\r\nChristian on his death-bed, and in that capacity was duly convicted of\r\nbeing a sorry individual. Robertson[256] was still spoken of, because\r\nhe was dry.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: English literature.]\r\n\r\nWhere the poets were concerned, the \"elegant extracts\" served as a\r\nplace of banishment for a few pieces by Dryden[257]; people refused to\r\nforgive Pope[258] for his verse, although they visited his house at\r\nTwickenham and cut chips from the weeping-willow planted by him and\r\nwithered like his fame.\r\n\r\nBlair[259] was looked upon as a tedious critic with a French style; he\r\nwas placed far below Johnson[260]. As to the old _Spectator_[261], it\r\nwas relegated to the lumber-room.\r\n\r\nEnglish political works have little interest for us. The economic\r\ntreatises are less stinted in their scope: their calculations on the\r\nwealth of nations, the employment of capital, the balance of trade,\r\nare applicable in part to the different European societies. Burke[262]\r\nemerged from the national political individuality: by declaring himself\r\nopposed to the French Revolution, he dragged his country into the long\r\nroad of hostilities which ended in the plains of Waterloo.\r\n\r\nHowever, great figures remained. One met with Milton and Shakespeare\r\non every hand. Did Montmorency[263], Byron[264], Sully[265], by turns\r\nFrench Ambassadors to the Courts of Elizabeth[266] and James I.[267],\r\never hear speak of a merry-andrew who acted in his own and other\r\nwriters' farces? Did they ever pronounce the name, so outlandish in\r\nFrench, of Shakespeare? Did they suspect that there was here a glory\r\nbefore which their honours, pomps and ranks would become as nothing?\r\nWell, the comedian who undertook the part of the Ghost in _Hamlet_ was\r\nthe great spectre, the shade of the Middle Ages which rose over the\r\nworld like the evening star, at the moment when the Middle Ages were at\r\nlast descending among the dead: giant centuries which Dante[268] opened\r\nand Shakespeare closed.\r\n\r\nIn the Memorials of Whitelock[269], the contemporary of the singer of\r\nParadise Lost, we read of \"one Mr. Milton, a blind man, parliamentary\r\nsecretary for Latin despatches.\"\r\n\r\nMolière[270], the \"stage-player,\" performed his Pourceaugnac in the\r\nsame way that Shakespeare, the \"buffoon,\" clowned his Falstaff.\r\n\r\nThose veiled travellers, who come from time to time to sit at our\r\nboard, are treated by us as ordinary guests; we remain unaware of their\r\nnature until the day of their disappearance. On leaving the earth, they\r\nbecome transfigured, and say to us, as the angel from heaven said to\r\nTobias:\r\n\r\n\"I am one of the seven who stand before the Lord[271].\"\r\n\r\nBut, though misunderstood by men on their passage, those divinities do\r\nnot fail to recognise one another. Milton asks:\r\n\r\n    What needs my Shakespeare, for his honour'd bones,\r\n    The labour of an age in piled stones[272]?\r\n\r\nMichael Angelo[273], envying Dante's lot and genius, exclaims:\r\n\r\n    Pur fuss'io tal...\r\n    Per l'aspro esilio suo con sua virtute\r\n    Darci del mondo più felice stato.\r\n\r\nTasso celebrates Camoëns, as yet almost unknown, and acts as his\r\n\"Fame.\" Is there anything more admirable than the society of\r\nillustrious people revealing themselves, one to the other, by means of\r\nsigns, greeting one another and communing with each other in a language\r\nunderstood by themselves alone?\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Shakespeare.]\r\n\r\nWas Shakespeare lame, like Lord Byron, Sir Walter Scott[274], and the\r\nPrayers, the daughters of Jupiter? If he was so in fact, the \"Boy\"\r\nof Stratford, far from being ashamed of his infirmity, as was Childe\r\nHarold, is not afraid to remind one of his mistresses of it:\r\n\r\n    So I, made lame by fortune's dearest spite[275].\r\n\r\nShakespeare must have had many loves, if we were to count one for each\r\nsonnet. The creator of Desdemona and Juliet grew old without ceasing\r\nto be in love. Was the unknown woman to whom he addresses his charming\r\nverses proud and happy to be the object of Shakespeare's Sonnets? It\r\nmay be doubted: glory is to an old man what diamonds are to an old\r\nwoman; they adorn, but cannot make her beautiful. Says the English\r\ntragic poet to his mistress:\r\n\r\n    No longer mourn for me when I am dead\r\n     .      .      .      .      .      .\r\n    Nay, if you read this line, remember not\r\n    The hand that writ it; for I love you so,\r\n    That I in your sweet thoughts would be forgot,\r\n    If thinking on me then should make you woe.\r\n    O, if, I say, you look upon this verse\r\n    When I perhaps compounded am with clay,\r\n    Do not so much as my poor name rehearse,\r\n    But let your love even with my life decay[276].\r\n\r\nShakespeare loved, but believed no more in love than he believed in\r\nother things: a woman to him was a bird, a zephyr, a flower, a thing\r\nthat charms and passes. Through his indifference to, or ignorance of,\r\nhis fame, through his condition, which set him without the pale of\r\nsociety and of a position to which he could not hope to attain, he\r\nseemed to have taken life as a light, unoccupied hour, a swift and\r\ngentle leisure.\r\n\r\nShakespeare, in his youth, met old monks driven from their cloister,\r\nwho had seen Henry VIII., his reforms, his destructions of monasteries,\r\nhis \"fools,\" his wives, his mistresses, his headsmen. When the poet\r\ndeparted from life, Charles I. was sixteen years of age. Thus, with one\r\nhand, Shakespeare was able to touch the whitened heads once threatened\r\nby the sword of the second of the Tudors and, with the other, the\r\nbrown head of the second of the Stuarts, destined to be laid low by\r\nthe axe of the Parliamentarians. Leaning upon those tragic brows, the\r\ngreat tragedian sank into the tomb; he filled the interval of the days\r\nin which he lived with his ghosts, his blind kings, his ambitious\r\nmen punished, his unfortunate women, so as to join together, through\r\nanalogous fictions, the realities of the past and of the future.\r\n\r\nShakespeare is of the number of the five or six writers who have\r\nsufficed for the needs and nutriment of thought: those parent\r\ngeniuses seem to have brought forth and suckled all the others. Homer\r\nimpregnated antiquity: Æschylus, Sophocles, Euripides, Aristophanes,\r\nHorace, Virgil are his sons. Dante engendered Modern Italy, from\r\nPetrarch to Tasso. Rabelais created French literature: Montaigne, La\r\nFontaine, Molière descend from him. England is all Shakespeare, and in\r\nthese later days he has lent his language to Byron, his dialogue to\r\nWalter Scott.\r\n\r\nMen often disown these supreme masters; they rebel against them; they\r\nreckon up their faults: they accuse them of tediousness, of length,\r\nof extravagance, of bad taste, what time they plunder them and deck\r\nthemselves in their spoils; but they struggle in vain against their\r\nyoke. Everything wears their colours; they have left their traces\r\neverywhere; they invent words and names which go to swell the general\r\nvocabulary of the nations; their expressions become proverbs, their\r\nfictitious characters change into real characters, with heirs and a\r\nlineage. They open out horizons whence burst forth sheaves of light;\r\nthey sow ideas, the germs of a thousand others; they supply all the\r\narts with imaginations, subjects, styles: their works are the mines or\r\nthe bowels of the human mind.\r\n\r\nThese geniuses occupy the first rank; their vastness, their variety,\r\ntheir fruitfulness, their originality cause them to be accepted from\r\nthe very first as laws, models, moulds, types of the various forms of\r\nintellect, even as there are four or five races of men issuing from one\r\nsingle stock, of which the others are only branches. Let us take care\r\nhow we insult the disorders into which these mighty beings sometimes\r\nfall: let us not imitate Ham, the accursed; let us not laugh if we see\r\nthe sole and solitary mariner of the deep lying naked and asleep, in\r\nthe shadow of the Ark resting upon the mountains of Armenia. Let us\r\nrespect that diluvial navigator, who recommenced the Creation after the\r\nflood-gates of Heaven were shut up: let us, as pious children, blessed\r\nby our father, modestly cover him with our cloak.\r\n\r\nShakespeare, in his lifetime, never thought of living after his life:\r\nwhat signifies to him to-day my hymn of admiration? Admitting every\r\nsupposition, reasoning from the truths or falsehoods with which the\r\nhuman mind is penetrated or imbued, what cares Shakespeare for a renown\r\nof which the sound cannot rise to where he is? A Christian? In the\r\nmidst of eternal bliss, does he think of the nothingness of the world?\r\nA deist? Freed from the shades of matter, lost in the splendours of\r\nGod, does he cast down a look upon the grain of sand over which he\r\npassed? An atheist? He sleeps the sleep without breathing or awakening\r\nwhich we call death. Nothing therefore is vainer than glory beyond the\r\ntomb, unless it have kept friendship alive, unless it have been useful\r\nto virtue, helpful to misfortune, unless it be granted to us to rejoice\r\nin Heaven in a consoling, generous, liberating idea left behind by us\r\nupon earth.\r\n\r\n*\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Samuel Richardson.]\r\n\r\nNovels, at the end of the last century, had been included in\r\nthe general proscription. Richardson[277] slept forgotten: his\r\nfellow-countrymen discovered in his style traces of the inferior\r\nsociety in which he had spent his life. Fielding[278] maintained his\r\nsuccess; Sterne[279], the purveyor of eccentricity, was out of date.\r\nThe _Vicar of Wakefield_ was still read[280].\r\n\r\nIf Richardson has no style, a question of which we foreigners are\r\nunable to judge, he will not live, because one lives only by style. It\r\nis vain to rebel against this truth: the best-composed work, adorned\r\nwith life-like portraits, filled with a thousand other perfections, is\r\nstill-born if the style be wanting. Style, and there are a thousand\r\nkinds, is not learnt; it is the gift of Heaven, it is talent. But,\r\nif Richardson has only been forsaken because of certain homely turns\r\nof expression, insufferable to an elegant society, he may revive:\r\nthe revolution which is being worked, in lowering the aristocracy\r\nand raising the middle classes, will render less apparent, or cause\r\nentirely to disappear, the traces of homespun habits and of an inferior\r\nlanguage.\r\n\r\nFrom _Clarissa_ and _Tom Jones_ sprang the two principal branches of\r\nthe family of modern English novels: the novels of family pictures and\r\ndomestic dramas, and the novels of adventure and pictures of general\r\nsociety. After Richardson, the manners of the West End invaded the\r\ndomain of fiction: the novels became filled with country-houses, lords\r\nand ladies, scenes at the waters, adventures at the races, the ball,\r\nthe opera, Ranelagh, with a never-ending chit-chat and tittle-tattle.\r\nThe scene was rapidly changed to Italy; the lovers crossed the Alps\r\namid terrible dangers and sorrows of the soul calculated to move lions:\r\n\"the lion shed tears!\" A jargon of good company was adopted.\r\n\r\nOf the thousands of novels which have flooded England since the last\r\nfifty years, two have kept their places: _Caleb Williams_[281] and the\r\n_Monk._ I did not see Godwin during my stay in London; but I twice\r\nmet Lewis[282]. He was a young member of the House of Commons, very\r\npleasant, with the air and manners of a Frenchman. The works of Ann\r\nRadcliffe[283] are of a class apart Those of Mrs. Barbauld[284], Miss\r\nEdgeworth[285], Miss Burney[286], etc., have a chance of living.\r\n\r\n*\r\n\r\n\"There should,\" says Montaigne, \"be some correction appointed by the\r\nlaws against foolish and unprofitable writers, as there is against\r\nvagabonds and loiterers; so should both my selfe and a hundred others\r\nof our people be banished.... Scribbling seemeth to be a symptome or\r\npassion of an irregular and licentious age[287].\"\r\n\r\n*\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Sir Walter Scott.]\r\n\r\nBut these different schools of sedentary novelists, of novelists\r\ntravelling by diligence or calash, of novelists of lakes and mountains,\r\nruins and ghosts, of novelists of cities and drawing-rooms, have\r\ncome to be lost in the new school of Walter Scott, even as poetry\r\nhas precipitated itself in the steps of Lord Byron. The illustrious\r\npainter of Scotland started his career in literature during my exile\r\nin London with his translation of Goethe's _Berlichingen._[288] He\r\ncontinued to make himself known by poetry, and ultimately the bent of\r\nhis genius led him towards the novel. He seems to me to have created a\r\nfalse manner: the romancer set himself to write historical romances,\r\nand the historian romantic histories. If, in reading Walter Scott, I\r\nam sometimes obliged to skip interminable conversations, the fault is\r\ndoubtless mine; but one of Walter Scott's great merits, in my eyes, is\r\nthat he can be placed in the hands of everybody. It requires greater\r\nefforts of talent to interest while keeping within the limits of\r\ndecency than to please when exceeding all bounds; it is less easy to\r\nrule the heart than to disturb it.\r\n\r\nBurke kept the politics of England in the past. Walter Scott\r\ndrove back the English to the Middle Ages; all that they wrote,\r\nmanufactured, built, became Gothic: books, furniture, houses,\r\nchurches, country-seats. But the barons of Magna Charta are to-day the\r\nfashionables of Bond Street, a frivolous race camping in the ancient\r\nmanor-houses while awaiting the arrival of the new generations which\r\nare preparing to drive them out.\r\n\r\n*\r\n\r\nAt the same time that the novel was passing into the \"romantic\" stage,\r\npoetry was undergoing a similar transformation. Cowper[289] abandoned\r\nthe French in order to revive the national school; Burns[290] commenced\r\nthe same revolution in Scotland. After them came the restorers of the\r\nballads. Several of those poets of 1792 to 1800 belonged to what was\r\ncalled the \"Lake school,\" a name which survived, because the romantic\r\npoets lived on the shores of the Cumberland and Westmoreland lakes,\r\nwhich they sometimes sang.\r\n\r\nThomas Moore[291], Campbell[292], Rogers[293], Crabbe[294],\r\nWordsworth[295], Southey[296], Hunt[297], Knowles[298], Lord\r\nHolland[299], Canning[300], Croker[301] are still living to do honour\r\nto English literature; but one must be of English birth to appreciate\r\nthe full merit of an intimate class of composition which appeals\r\nspecially to men born on the soil.\r\n\r\nNone is a competent judge, in living literature, of other than works\r\nwritten in his own tongue. It is in vain that you believe yourself\r\nthoroughly acquainted with a foreign idiom: you lack the nurse's milk,\r\ntogether with the first words which she teaches you at her breast and\r\nin your swaddling-clothes; certain accents belong to the mother country\r\nalone. The English and Germans have the strangest notions concerning\r\nour men of letters: they worship what we despise, and despise what\r\nwe worship; they do not understand Racine nor La Fontaine, nor even\r\nMolière completely. It is ludicrous to know who are considered our\r\ngreat writers in London, Vienna, Berlin, St Petersburg, Munich,\r\nLeipzig, Göttingen, Cologne, to know what is read there with avidity\r\nand what not at all.\r\n\r\nWhen an author's merit lies especially in his diction, no foreigner\r\nwill ever understand that merit. The more intimate, individual,\r\nrational a talent is, the more do its mysteries escape the mind which\r\nis not, so to speak, that talent's fellow-countryman. We admire the\r\nGreeks and Romans on trust; our admiration comes to us by tradition,\r\nand the Greeks and Romans are not there to laugh at our barbarian\r\njudgments. Which of us has an idea of the harmony of the prose of\r\nDemosthenes and Cicero, of the cadence of the verses of Alcæus and\r\nHorace, as they were caught by a Greek or Latin ear? Men maintain that\r\nreal beauties are of all times, all countries: yes, beauties of feeling\r\nand of thought; not beauties of style. Style is not cosmopolitan like\r\nthought: it has a native land, a sky, a sun of its own.\r\n\r\nBurns, Mason[302], Cowper died during my emigration, before 1800 and\r\nin 1800: they ended the century; I commenced it. Darwin[303] and\r\nBeattie[304] died two years after my return from exile.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: James Beattie.]\r\n\r\nBeattie had announced the new era of the lyre. The _Minstrel, or the\r\nProgress of Genius_ is the picture of the first effects of the muse\r\nupon a young bard who is as yet unaware of the inspiration with which\r\nhe is tossed. Now the future poet goes and sits by the sea-shore during\r\na tempest; again he leaves the village sports to listen in some lonely\r\nspot to the distant sound of the pipes. Beattie has run through the\r\nentire series of reveries and melancholy ideas of which a hundred other\r\npoets have believed themselves the discoverers. Beattie proposed to\r\ncontinue his poem; he did, in fact, write the second canto: Edwin one\r\nevening hears a grave voice ascend from the bottom of the valley; it\r\nis the voice of a solitary who, after tasting the illusions of the\r\nworld, has buried himself in that retreat, there to collect his soul\r\nand to sing the marvels of the Creator. This hermit instructs the young\r\nminstrel and reveals to him the secret of his genius. Beattie was\r\ndestined to shed tears; the death of his son broke his paternal heart:\r\nlike Ossian, after the loss of his son Oscar, he hung his harp on the\r\nbranches of an oak. Perhaps Beattie's son was the young minstrel whom a\r\nfather had sung and whose footsteps he no longer saw on the mountain.\r\n\r\n*\r\n\r\nLord Byron's verses contain striking imitations of the Minstrel. At the\r\ntime of my exile in England, Lord Byron was living at Harrow School,\r\nin a village ten miles from London. He was a child, I was young and\r\nas unknown as he; he had been brought up on the heaths of Scotland,\r\nby the sea-side, as I in the marshes of Brittany, by the sea-side; he\r\nfirst loved the Bible and Ossian, as I loved them; he sang the memories\r\nof his childhood in Newstead Abbey, as I sang mine in Combourg Castle:\r\n\r\n    When I roved a young Highlander o'er the dark heath.\r\n       And climb'd thy steep summit, O Morven of snow!\r\n    To gaze on the torrent that thunder'd beneath,\r\n       Or the mist of the tempest that gather'd below[305].\r\n\r\nIn my wanderings in the neighbourhood of London, when I was so unhappy,\r\nI passed through the village of Harrow a score of times, without\r\nsuspecting the genius it contained. I have sat in the churchyard at the\r\nfoot of the elm beneath which, in 1807, Lord Byron wrote these verses,\r\nat the time when I was returning from Palestine:\r\n\r\n    Spot of my youth! whose hoary branches sigh,\r\n    Swept by the breeze that fans thy cloudless sky;\r\n    Where now alone I muse, who oft have trod,\r\n    With those I loved, thy soft and verdant sod.\r\n    .     .     .     .     .     .     .     .\r\n    When fate shall chill, at length, this fever'd breast,\r\n    And calm its cares and passions into rest,\r\n    .     .     .     .     .     .     .     .\r\n    .     .     .     .     here my heart might lie;\r\n    Here might I sleep where all my hopes arose,\r\n    .     .     .     .     .     .     .     .\r\n    Mix'd with the earth o'er which my footsteps moved;\r\n    .     .     .     .     .     .     .     .\r\n    Deplored by those in early days allied,\r\n    And unremembered by the world beside[306].\r\n\r\nAnd I shall say: Hail, ancient elm, at whose foot the child Byron\r\nindulged in the fancies of his age, while I was dreaming of _René_\r\nbeneath thy shade, the same shade beneath which later, in his turn, the\r\npoet came to dream of _Childe Harold!_ Byron asked of the churchyard,\r\nwhich witnessed the first sports of his life, an unknown grave: a\r\nuseless prayer, which fame will not grant. Nevertheless, Byron is no\r\nlonger what he has been; I had come across him in all directions living\r\nat Venice: at the end of a few years, in the same town where I had\r\nmet with his name on every hand, I found him everywhere eclipsed and\r\nunknown. The echoes of the Lido no longer repeat his name and, if you\r\nask after him of the Venetians, they no longer know of whom you speak.\r\nLord Byron is entirely dead for them; they no longer hear the neighing\r\nof his horse: it is the same thing in London, where his memory is\r\nfading. That is what we become.\r\n\r\nIf I have passed by Harrow without knowing that the child Byron was\r\ndrawing breath there, Englishmen have passed by Combourg without\r\nsuspecting that a little vagabond, brought up in those woods, would\r\nleave any trace. Arthur Young[307], the traveller, when passing through\r\nCombourg, wrote:\r\n\r\n    \"To Combourg [from Pontorson] the country has a savage\r\n    aspect; husbandry has not much further advanced, at least in\r\n    skill, than among the Hurons, which appears incredible amidst\r\n    inclosures; the people almost as wild as their country, and\r\n    their town of Combourg one of the most brutal filthy places\r\n    that can be seen; mud houses, no windows, and a pavement so\r\n    broken as to impede all passengers, but ease none-yet here is\r\n    a chateau, and inhabited; who is this Mons. de Chateaubriand,\r\n    the owner, that has nerves strung for a residence amidst such\r\n    filth and poverty? Below this hideous heap of wretchedness is\r\n    a fine lake, surrounded by well-wooded inclosures[308].\"\r\n\r\n\r\nThat M. de Chateaubriand was my father; the residence which seemed so\r\nhideous to the ill-humoured agriculturist is none the less a fine and\r\nstately home, sombre and grave though it may be. As for me, a feeble\r\nivy-shoot commencing to climb at the foot of those fierce towers, would\r\nMr. Young have noticed me, he who was interested only in inspecting our\r\nharvests?\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Lord Byron.]\r\n\r\nGive me leave to add to the above pages, written in England in 1822,\r\nthe following written in 1824 and 1840: they will complete the portion\r\nrelating to Lord Byron; this portion will be more particularly\r\nperfected when the reader has perused what I shall have to say of the\r\ngreat poet on passing to Venice.\r\n\r\nThere may perhaps be some interest in the future in remarking the\r\ncoincidence of the two leaders of the new French and English schools\r\nhaving a common fund of nearly parallel ideas and destinies, if not of\r\nmorals: one a peer of England, the other a peer of France; both Eastern\r\ntravellers, not infrequently near each other, yet never seeing one\r\nanother: only, the life of the English poet has been connected with\r\nevents less great than mine.\r\n\r\nLord Byron visited the ruins of Greece after me: in _Childe Harold_\r\nhe seems to embellish with his own pigments the descriptions in the\r\n_Itinéraire._ At the commencement of my pilgrimage I gave the Sire de\r\nJoinville's farewell to his castle: Byron bids a similar farewell to\r\nhis Gothic home.\r\n\r\nIn the _Martyrs_, Eudore sets out from Messenia to go to Rome:\r\n\r\n    \"Our voyage was long,\" he says; \"... we saw all those\r\n    promontories marked by temples or tombstones.... My young\r\n    companions had heard speak of nought save the metamorphoses\r\n    of Jupiter, and they understood nothing of the remains they\r\n    saw before them; I myself had already sat, with the prophet,\r\n    on the ruins of devastated cities, and Babylon taught me to\r\n    know Corinth[309].\"\r\n\r\n\r\nThe English poet is like the French prose-writer, following the letter\r\nof Sulpicius to Cicero[310]: a coincidence so perfect is a singularly\r\nproud one for me, because I anticipated the immortal singer on the\r\nshore where we gathered the same memories and celebrated the same ruins.\r\n\r\nI have again the honour of being connected with Lord Byron in our\r\ndescriptions of Rome: the _Martyrs_ and my _Lettre sur la campagne\r\nromaine_ possess, for me, the inestimable advantage of having divined\r\nthe aspirations of a fine genius.\r\n\r\nThe early translators, commentators and admirers of Lord Byron were\r\ncareful not to point out that some pages of my works might have\r\nlingered for a moment in the memory of the painter of _Childe Harold_;\r\nthey would have thought that they were depreciating his genius. Now\r\nthat the enthusiasm has grown a little calmer this honour is not so\r\nconsistently refused to me. Our immortal song-writer[311], in the last\r\nvolume of his Chansons, says:\r\n\r\n    \"In one of the foregoing stanzas I speak of the 'lyres' which\r\n    France owes to M. de Chateaubriand. I do not fear that that\r\n    verse will be contradicted by the new poetic school, which,\r\n    born beneath the eagle's wings, has often and rightly prided\r\n    itself on that origin. The influence of the author of the\r\n    _Génie du Christianisme_ has also made itself felt abroad,\r\n    and it would perhaps be just to recognise that the singer of\r\n    _Childe Harold_ belongs to the family of _René._\"\r\n\r\nIn an excellent article on Lord Byron, M. Villemain[312] re-echoes M.\r\nde Béranger's remark:\r\n\r\n    \"Some incomparable pages in _René_\" he says, \"had, it is\r\n    true, exhausted that poetic character. I do not know whether\r\n    Byron imitated them or revived them with his genius.\"\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Literary affinity.]\r\n\r\nWhat I have just said as to the affinity of imagination and destiny\r\nbetween the chronicles of _René_ and the singer of _Childe Harold_\r\ndoes not detract in the smallest degree from the fame of the immortal\r\nbard. What harm can my pedestrian and luteless muse do to the muse of\r\nthe Dee[313], furnished with a lyre and wings? Lord Byron will live\r\nwhether, a child of his century like myself, he gave utterance, like\r\nmyself and like Goethe before us, to its passion and misfortune, or\r\nwhether my circumnavigation and the lantern of my Gallic bark showed\r\nthe vessel of Albion the track across unexplored waters.\r\n\r\nBesides, two minds of an analogous nature may easily have similar\r\nconceptions without being reproached with slavishly following the same\r\nroad. It is permitted to take advantage of ideas and images expressed\r\nin a foreign language, in order with them to enrich one's own: that has\r\noccurred in all ages and at all times. I recognise without hesitation\r\nthat, in my early youth, Ossian[314], _Werther_[315], the _Rêveries du\r\npromeneur solitaire_[316] and the _Études de la nature_[317] may have\r\nallied themselves to my ideas; but I have hidden or dissimulated none\r\nof the pleasure caused me by works in which I delighted.\r\n\r\nIf it were true that _René_ entered to some extent into the groundwork\r\nof the one person represented under different names in _Childe-Harold,\r\nConrad, Lara, Manfred_, the _Giaour_; if, by chance, Lord Byron had\r\nmade me live in his own life, would he then have had the weakness never\r\nto mention me[318]? Was I then one of those fathers whom men deny\r\nwhen they have attained to power? Can Lord Byron have been completely\r\nignorant of me when he quotes almost all the French authors who are his\r\ncontemporaries? Did he never hear speak of me, when the English papers,\r\nlike the French papers, have resounded a score of times in his hearing\r\nwith controversies on my works, when the _New Times_ drew a parallel\r\nbetween the author of the _Génie du Christianisme_ and the author of\r\n_Childe-Harold?_\r\n\r\nNo intelligence, however favoured it be, but has its susceptibilities,\r\nits distrusts: one wishes to keep the sceptre, fears to share it,\r\nresents comparisons. In the same way, another superior talent has\r\navoided the mention of my name in a work on Literature[319]. Thank God,\r\nrating myself at my just value, I have never aimed at empire; since\r\nI believe in nothing except the religious truth, of which liberty is\r\na form, I have no more faith in myself than in any other thing here\r\nbelow. But I have never felt a need to be silent, where I have admired;\r\nthat is why I proclaim my enthusiasm for Madame de Staël and Lord\r\nByron. What is sweeter than admiration? It is love in Heaven, affection\r\nraised to a cult; we feel ourselves thrilled with gratitude for the\r\ndivinity which extends the bases of our faculties, opens out new views\r\nto our souls, gives us a happiness so great and so pure, with no\r\nadmixture of fear or envy.\r\n\r\nFor the rest, the little cavil which I have raised in these Memoirs\r\nagainst the greatest poet whom England has possessed since Milton\r\nproves only one thing: the high value which I would have attached to\r\nthe recollection of his muse.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The real Byron.]\r\n\r\nLord Byron started a deplorable school: I presume he has been as much\r\ndistressed at the Childe-Harolds to whom he gave birth as I am at the\r\nRenés who rave around me.\r\n\r\nThe life of Lord Byron is the object of much investigation and calumny:\r\nyoung men have taken magic words seriously; women have felt disposed\r\nto allow themselves affrightedly to be seduced by that \"monster,\" to\r\nconsole that solitary and unhappy Satan. Who knows? He had perhaps\r\nnot found the woman he sought, a woman fair enough, a heart as big as\r\nhis own. Byron, according to the phantasmagorial opinion, is the old\r\nserpent of seduction and corruption, because he sees the corruption\r\nof the human race; he is a fatal and suffering genius, placed between\r\nthe mysteries of matter and mind, who is unable to solve the enigma of\r\nthe universe, who looks upon life as a frightful and causeless irony,\r\nas a perverse smile of evil; he is the son of despair, who despises\r\nand denies, who, bearing an incurable wound within himself, seeks his\r\nrevenge by leading through voluptuousness to sorrow all who approach\r\nhim; he is a man who has not passed through the age of innocence, who\r\nhas never had the advantage of being rejected and cursed by God: a\r\nman who, issuing reprobate from nature's womb, is the damned soul of\r\nnihility.\r\n\r\nThis is the Byron of heated imaginations: it is by no means, to my\r\nmind, the Byron of truth. Two different men are united in Lord Byron,\r\nas in the majority of men: the man of _nature_ and the man of _system._\r\nThe poet, perceiving the part which the public made him play, accepted\r\nit and began to curse the world which at first he had only viewed\r\ndreamily: this progress can be traced in the chronological order of his\r\nworks. His _genius_, far from having the extent attributed to it, is\r\nfairly reserved; his poetic thought is no more than a moan, a plaint,\r\nan imprecation; in that quality it is admirable: one must not ask the\r\nlyre what it thinks, but what it sings. His _mind_ is sarcastic and\r\ndiversified, but of an exciting nature and a baneful influence: the\r\nwriter had read Voltaire to good purpose, and imitates him.\r\n\r\nGifted with every advantage, Lord Byron had little with which to\r\nreproach his birth; the very accident which made him unhappy and which\r\nallied his superiority to the infirmity of mankind ought not to have\r\nvexed him, since it did not prevent him from being loved. The immortal\r\nsinger knew from his own case the truth of Zeno's maxim: \"The voice is\r\nthe flower of beauty.\"\r\n\r\nA deplorable thing is the rapidity with which, nowadays, reputations\r\npass away. At the end of a few years-what am I saying?--of a few\r\nmonths, the infatuation disappears and disparagement follows upon\r\nit. Already Lord Byron's glory is seen to pale; his genius is better\r\nunderstood by ourselves; he will have altars longer in France than\r\nin England. Since _Childe-Harold_ excels mainly in the depicting\r\nof sentiments peculiar to the individual, the English, who prefer\r\nsentiments common to all, will end by disowning the poet whose cry is\r\nso deep and so sad. Let them look to it: if they shatter the image of\r\nthe man who has brought them to life again, what will they have left?\r\n\r\n*\r\n\r\nWhen, during my sojourn in London, in 1822, I wrote my opinion of\r\nLord Byron, he had no more than two years to live upon earth: he died\r\nin 1824, at the moment when disenchantment and disgust were about to\r\ncommence for him. I preceded him in life; he preceded me in death; he\r\nwas called before his turn: my number was higher than his, and yet\r\nhis was drawn first. Childe-Harold should have remained; the world\r\ncould lose me without noticing my disappearance. On continuing my road\r\nthrough life, I met Madame Guiccioli[320] in Rome, Lady Byron[321] in\r\nParis. Frailty and virtue thus appeared to me: the former had perhaps\r\ntoo many realities, the latter too few dreams.\r\n\r\n*\r\n\r\nNow, after having talked to you of the English writers, at the period\r\nwhen England served me as an asylum, it but remains for me to tell you\r\nof England herself at that period, of her appearance, her sites, her\r\ncountry-seats, her private and political manners.\r\n\r\nThe whole of England may be seen in the space of four leagues, from\r\nRichmond, above London, down to Greenwich and below.\r\n\r\nBelow London lies industrial and commercial England, with her docks,\r\nher warehouses, her custom-houses, her arsenals, her breweries, her\r\nfactories, her foundries, her ships; the latter, at each high tide,\r\nascend the Thames in three divisions: first, the smallest; then, the\r\nmiddle-sized; lastly, the great vessels which graze with their sails\r\nthe columns of the Old Sailors' Hospital and the windows of the tavern\r\nwhere the visitors dine.\r\n\r\nAbove London lies agricultural and pastoral England, with her\r\nmeadows, her flocks and herds, her country-houses, her parks, whose\r\nshrubs and lawns are bathed twice a day by the rising waters of the\r\nThames. Between these two opposite points, Richmond and Greenwich,\r\nLondon blends all the characteristics of this two-fold England: the\r\naristocracy in the West End, the democracy in the East; the Tower of\r\nLondon and Westminster Abbey are landmarks between which is laid the\r\nwhole history of Great Britain.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Richmond.]\r\n\r\nI passed a portion of the summer of 1799 at Richmond with Christian\r\nde Lamoignon, occupying myself with the _Génie du Christianisme._ I\r\nwent on the Thames in a rowing-boat, or walked in Richmond Park. I\r\ncould have wished that Richmond by London had been the Richmond of\r\nthe treaty _Honor Richemundiæ_, for then I should have found myself\r\nin my own country, and for this reason: William the Bastard made a\r\ngrant to Alan[322] Duke of Brittany, his son-in-law, of 442 English\r\nfeudal estates, which since formed the County of Richmond[323]: the\r\nDukes of Brittany, Alan's successors, enfeoffed these domains to Breton\r\nknights, cadets of the families of Rohan, Tinténiac, Chateaubriand,\r\nGoyon, Montboucher. But, in spite of my inclinations, I must look in\r\nYorkshire for the County of Richmond, raised to a duchy by Charles\r\nII.[324] in favour of a bastard[325]: the Richmond on the Thames is\r\nthe Old Sheen of Edward III. There, in 1377, died Edward III., that\r\nfamous King robbed by his mistress, Alice Perrers[326], who was not\r\nthe same as the Alice or Catharine of Salisbury of the early days of\r\nthe life of the victor of Crecy: you should only love at the age when\r\nyou can be loved. Henry VIII. and Elizabeth also died at Richmond:\r\nwhere does one not die? Henry VIII. took pleasure in this residence.\r\nThe English historians are greatly embarrassed by that abominable man:\r\non the one hand, they are unable to conceal the tyranny and servitude\r\nto which the Parliament was subjected; on the other hand, if they too\r\nheartily anathematized the Head of the Reformation, they would condemn\r\nthemselves in condemning him:\r\n\r\n    Plus l'oppresseur est vil, plus l'esclave est infâme[327].\r\n\r\nIn Richmond Park is shown the mound which served Henry VIII. as an\r\nobservatory from which to spy for the news of the execution of Anne\r\nBoleyn[328]. Henry leapt for joy when the signal shot up from the Tower\r\nof London. What delight! The steel had cut through the slender neck,\r\nand covered with blood the beautiful tresses to which the poet-King had\r\nfastened his fatal kisses.\r\n\r\nIn the deserted park at Richmond I awaited no murderous signal, I would\r\nnot even have wished the slightest harm to any who might have betrayed\r\nme. I strolled among the peaceful deer: accustomed to run before a\r\npack of hounds, they stopped when they were tired; they were carried\r\nback, very gay and quite amused with this game, in a cart filled with\r\nstraw. I went at Kew to see the kangaroos, ridiculous animals, the\r\nexact opposite to the giraffe: these innocent four-footed grass hoppers\r\npeopled Australia better than the old Duke of Queensberry's[329]\r\nprostitutes peopled the lanes of Richmond. The Thames bathed the\r\nlawn of a cottage half-hidden beneath a cedar of Lebanon and amidst\r\nweeping-willows: a newly married couple had come to spend the honeymoon\r\nin that paradise.\r\n\r\nOne evening, as I was strolling over the swards of Twickenham, Peltier\r\nappeared, holding his handkerchief to his mouth:\r\n\r\n\"What an everlasting deuce of a fog!\" he cried, so soon as he was\r\nwithin earshot. \"How the devil can you remain here? I have made out my\r\nlist: Stowe, Blenheim, Hampton Court, Oxford; with your dreamy ways,\r\nyou might live with John Bull _in vitam æternam_ and not see a thing!\"\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: A journey with Peltier.]\r\n\r\nI asked in vain to be excused, I had to go. In the carriage, Peltier\r\nenumerated his hopes to me; he had relays of them; no sooner had\r\none croaked beneath him than he straddled another, and on he would\r\ngo, a leg on either side, to his journey's end. One of his hopes,\r\nthe robustest, eventually led him to Bonaparte, whom he took by the\r\ncoat-collar: Napoleon had the simplicity to hit back[330]. Peltier\r\ntook Sir James Mackintosh[331] as his second; he was condemned by the\r\ncourts, and made a new fortune (which he incontinently ran through) by\r\nselling the documents relating to his trial.\r\n\r\nBlenheim[332] was distasteful to me; I suffered so much the more from\r\nan ancient reverse of my country in that I had had to endure the\r\ninsult of a recent affront: a boat going up the Thames caught sight\r\nof me on the bank; seeing a Frenchman, the oarsmen gave cheers; the\r\nnews had just been received of the naval battle of Aboukir: these\r\nsuccesses of the foreigner, which might open the gates of France to me,\r\nwere hateful to me. Nelson[333], whom I had often met in Hyde Park,\r\nwrapped his victories in Lady Hamilton's[334] shawl at Naples, while\r\nthe _lazzaroni_ played at ball with human heads. The admiral died\r\ngloriously at Trafalgar[335], and his mistress wretchedly at Calais,\r\nafter losing beauty, youth and fortune. And I, taunted on the Thames\r\nwith the victory of Aboukir, have seen the palm-trees of Libya edging\r\nthe calm and deserted sea which was reddened with the blood of my\r\nfellow-countrymen.\r\n\r\nStowe Park[336] is famous for its ornamental buildings: I prefer its\r\nshades. The cicerone of the place showed us, in a gloomy ravine, the\r\ncopy of a temple of which I was to admire the original in the dazzling\r\nvalley of the Cephisus. Beautiful pictures of the Italian school pined\r\nin the darkness of some uninhabited rooms, whose shutters were kept\r\nclosed: poor Raphael, imprisoned in a castle of the ancient Britons,\r\nfar from the skies of the Farnesina[337]!\r\n\r\nAt Hampton Court was preserved the collection of portraits of the\r\nmistresses of Charles II.: you see how that Prince took things on\r\nemerging from a revolution which cut off his father's head, and which\r\nwas to drive out his House.\r\n\r\nAt Slough we saw Herschel[338], with his learned sister[339] and his\r\ngreat forty-foot telescope; he was looking for new planets: this made\r\nPeltier laugh, who kept to the seven old ones.\r\n\r\nWe stopped for two days at Oxford. I took pleasure in this republic of\r\nAlfred the Great[340]; it represented the privileged liberties and the\r\nmanners of the literary institutions of the Middle Ages. We hurried\r\nthrough the twenty colleges, the libraries, the pictures, the museum,\r\nthe botanic garden. I turned over with extreme pleasure, among the\r\nmanuscripts of Worcester College, a life of the Black Prince, written\r\nin French verse by the Prince's herald-at-arms.\r\n\r\nOxford, without resembling them, recalled to my memory the modest\r\nColleges of Dol, Rennes and Dinan. I had translated Gray's[341] _Elegy\r\nwritten in a Country Church-yard_:\r\n\r\n    The curfew tolls the knell of parting day[342],\r\n\r\nwhich is imitated from Dante's\r\n\r\n                        Squilla di lontano\r\n    Che paja'l giorno pianger che si musre[343].\r\n\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Oxford.]\r\n\r\nPeltier had hastened to trumpet my translation in his paper. At sight\r\nof Oxford I remembered the same poet's _Ode on a distant Prospect of\r\nEton College_:\r\n\r\n    Ah, happy hills! ah, pleasing shade!\r\n       Ah, fields beloved in vain!\r\n    Where once my careless childhood strayed,\r\n       A stranger yet to pain!\r\n\r\n    I feel the gales that from ye blow,\r\n    .     .      .      .      .      .\r\n    My weary soul they seem to soothe,\r\n    And redolent of joy and youth,\r\n       To breathe a second spring.\r\n\r\n    Say, Father Thames,...\r\n    .     .      .      .      .      .\r\n    What idle progeny succeed\r\n    To chase the rolling circle's speed\r\n       Or urge the flying ball?\r\n\r\n    Alas! regardless of their doom\r\n       The little victims play!\r\n    No sense have they of ills to come,\r\n       Nor care beyond to-day[344].\r\n\r\nWho has not experienced the feelings and regrets here expressed with\r\nall the sweetness of the muse? Who has not softened at the recollection\r\nof the games, the studies, the loves of his early years? But can they\r\nbe revived? The pleasures of youth reproduced by the memory are ruins\r\nseen by torchlight.\r\n\r\n*\r\n\r\nSeparated from the Continent by a long war, the English at the end\r\nof the last century preserved their national manners and character.\r\nThere was still but one people, in whose name the sovereign power was\r\nwielded by an aristocratic government; only two great friendly classes\r\nexisted, bound by a common interest: the patrons and the dependents.\r\nThat jealous class called the bourgeoisie in France, which is beginning\r\nto arise in England, was then not known: nothing came between the rich\r\nland-owners and the men occupied with their trades. Everything had not\r\nyet become machinery in the manufacturing professions, folly in the\r\nprivileged classes. Along the same pavements where one now sees dirty\r\nfaces and men in surtouts, passed little girls in white cloaks, with\r\nstraw-hats fastened under the chin with a ribbon, a basket on their\r\narm, containing fruit or a book; all kept their eyes lowered, all\r\nblushed when one looked at them:\r\n\r\n\"Britain,\" says Shakespeare, is \"in a great pool, a swan's nest[345].\"\r\n\r\nSurtouts without coats beneath were so little worn in London in 1793\r\nthat a woman who was weeping bitterly over the death of Louis XVI. said\r\nto me:\r\n\r\n\"But, my dear sir, is it true that the poor King was dressed in a\r\nsurtout when they cut off his head?\"\r\n\r\nThe \"gentlemen farmers\" had not yet sold their patrimony in order to\r\ncome and live in London; in the House of Commons they still formed the\r\nindependent fraction which, acting in opposition to the Ministry, kept\r\nup ideas of liberty, order and property. They hunted the fox or shot\r\npheasants in autumn, ate fat geese at Christmas, shouted \"Hurrah\" for\r\nroast beef, grumbled at the present, praised the past, cursed Pitt and\r\nthe war, which sent up the price of port, and went to bed drunk to\r\nbegin the same life over again next day. They were firmly convinced\r\nthat the glory of Great Britain would never fade so long as they sang\r\n_God save the King_, maintained the rotten boroughs, kept the game laws\r\nin vigour, and sent hares and partridges to market by stealth under the\r\nname of \"lions\" and \"ostriches.\"\r\n\r\nThe Anglican clergy was learned, hospitable, and generous; it had\r\nreceived the French clergy with true Christian charity. The University\r\nof Oxford printed at its own cost and distributed gratis among the\r\ncurés a New Testament, according to the Latin Vulgate, with the\r\nimprint, \"_In usum cleri Gallicani in Anglia exulantis._\" As to the\r\nlife of the English upper classes, I, a poor exile, saw nothing of\r\nit but the outside. On the occasion of receptions at Court or at the\r\nPrincess of Wales's[346], ladies went by seated sideways in Sedan\r\nchairs; their great hoop-petticoats protruded through the door of the\r\nchair like altar-hangings. They themselves, on those altars of their\r\nwaists, resembled madonnas or pagodas. Those fine ladies were the\r\ndaughters whose mothers the Duc de Guiche and the Duc de Lauzun had\r\nadored; those daughters are, in 1822, the mothers and grandmothers of\r\nthe little girls who now come to my house to dance in short frocks to\r\nthe sound of Collinet's clarinet, swift generations of flowers.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: William Pitt.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: English statesmen.]\r\n\r\nThe England of 1688 was, at the end of the last century, at the apogee\r\nof its glory. As a poor emigrant in London, from 1793 to 1800, I heard\r\nPitt, Fox[347], Sheridan[348], Wilberforce[349], Grenville[350],\r\nWhitbread[351], Lauderdale[352], Erskine[353]; as a magnificent\r\nambassador in London to-day, in 1822, I could not say how far I am\r\nimpressed when, instead of the great orators whom I used to admire, I\r\nsee those get up who were their seconds at the time of my first visit,\r\nthe pupils in the place of the masters. General ideas have penetrated\r\ninto that particular society. But the enlightened aristocracy placed at\r\nthe head of this country since one hundred and forty years will have\r\nshown to the world one of the finest and greatest societies that have\r\ndone honour to mankind since the Roman patricians. Perhaps some old\r\nfamily, seated in the depths of its county, will recognise the society\r\nwhich I have depicted and regret the time whose loss I here deplore.\r\n\r\nIn 1792[354] Mr. Burke parted from Mr. Fox. The question at issue was\r\nthe French Revolution, which Mr. Burke attacked and Mr. Fox defended.\r\nNever had the two orators, who till then had been friends, displayed\r\nsuch eloquence. The whole House was moved, and Mr. Fox's eyes were\r\nfilled with tears when Mr. Burke concluded his speech with these words:\r\n\r\n    \"The right honourable gentleman in the speech he has just\r\n    made has treated me in every sentence with uncommon harshness\r\n    ... by declaring a censure upon my whole life, conduct, and\r\n    opinions. Notwithstanding this great and serious, though\r\n    on my part unmerited, attack.... I shall not be dismayed;\r\n    I am not yet afraid to state my sentiments in this House\r\n    or anywhere else.... I will tell all the world that the\r\n    Constitution is in danger.... It certainly is indiscretion\r\n    at any period, but especially at my time of life, to provoke\r\n    enemies, or to give my friends occasion to desert me; yet\r\n    if my firm and steady adherence to the British Constitution\r\n    places me in such a dilemma, I will risk all; and as public\r\n    duty and public prudence teach me, with my last words\r\n    exclaim, 'Fly from the French Constitution!'\"\r\n\r\nMr. Fox having said that there was \"no loss of friends,\" Mr. Burke\r\nexclaimed:\r\n\r\n    \"Yes, there is a loss of friends! I know the price of my\r\n    conduct; I have done my duty at the price of my friend; our\r\n    friendship is at an end.... I warn the two right honourable\r\n    gentlemen who are the great rivals in this House, that\r\n    whether they hereafter move in the political atmosphere as\r\n    two flaming meteors, or walk together like brethren hand in\r\n    hand, to preserve and cherish the British Constitution, to\r\n    guard against innovation, and to save it from the danger of\r\n    these new theories[355].\"\r\n\r\nA memorable time in the world's history!\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Edmund Burke.]\r\n\r\nMr. Burke, whom I knew towards the close of his life, crushed by the\r\ndeath of his only son, had founded a school for the benefit of the\r\nchildren of the poor Emigrants. I went to see what he called his\r\n\"nursery.\" He was amused at the vivacity of the foreign race which was\r\ngrowing up under his paternal genius. Looking at the careless little\r\nexiles hopping, he said to me:\r\n\r\n\"Our boys could not do that.\"\r\n\r\nAnd his eyes filled with tears. He thought of his son who had set out\r\nfor a longer exile.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: William Pitt.]\r\n\r\nPitt, Fox, and Burke are no more, and the British Constitution has\r\nundergone the influence of the \"new theories.\" One must have witnessed\r\nthe gravity of the parliamentary debates of that time, one must have\r\nheard those orators whose prophetic voices seemed to announce a coming\r\nrevolution, to form an idea of the scene which I am recalling. Liberty,\r\nconfined within the limits of order, seemed to struggle, at Westminster\r\nunder the influence of anarchical liberty, which spoke from the still\r\nblood-stained rostrum of the Convention.\r\n\r\nMr. Pitt was tall and thin, and wore a sad and mocking look.\r\nHis utterance was cold, his intonation monotonous, his gestures\r\nimperceptible; nevertheless, the lucidity and fluency of his thought,\r\nthe logic of his arguments, suddenly lighted with flashes of eloquence,\r\nraised his talent to something out of the common. I used often to see\r\nMr. Pitt, when he went from his house on foot across St. James's Park,\r\nto wait upon the King. George III.[356], on his side, arrived from\r\nWindsor after drinking beer out of a pewter pot with the neighbouring\r\nfarmers; he drove through the ugly court-yards of his ugly palace in\r\na dowdy carriage followed by a few Horse-guards. That was the master\r\nof the Kings of Europe, as five or six City merchants are the masters\r\nof India. Mr. Pitt, in a black coat, a steel-hilted sword at his side,\r\nhis hat under his arm, climbed the stairs, taking two or three steps at\r\na time. On his way he found only three or four unemployed Emigrants:\r\ncasting a scornful look in their direction, he went on, with his nose\r\nin the air, and his pale face.\r\n\r\nThe great financier maintained no order in his own affairs, had no\r\nregular hours for his meals or his sleep. Over head and ears in debt,\r\nhe paid nobody, and could not bring himself to add up a bill. A footman\r\nkept house for him. Badly dressed, with no pleasures, no passions,\r\ngreedy only for power, he scorned honours, and refused to be more than\r\nplain William Pitt.\r\n\r\nLord Liverpool, in the month of June last, 1822, took me to dine at\r\nhis country-place: when we were crossing Putney Heath, he showed me\r\nthe little house in which died, a poor man, the son of Lord Chatham,\r\nthe statesman who had taken Europe into his pay and with his own hand\r\ndistributed all the millions in the world[357].\r\n\r\nGeorge III. survived Mr. Pitt, but he had lost his reason and his\r\nsight. Every session, at the opening of Parliament, the ministers read\r\nto the silent and moved Houses the bulletin of the King's health. One\r\nday I had gone to visit Windsor: a few shillings persuaded an obliging\r\ndoor-keeper to hide me so that I might see the King. The monarch,\r\nwhite-haired and blind, appeared, wandering like King Lear through his\r\npalace and groping with his hands along the walls of the apartments.\r\nHe sat down to a piano, of which he knew the position, and played some\r\nportions of a sonata by Handel[358]: a fine ending for Old England!\r\n\r\n\r\nI began to turn my eyes towards my native land. A great revolution had\r\nbeen operated. Bonaparte had become First Consul and was restoring\r\norder by means of despotism; many exiles were returning; the upper\r\nEmigration, especially, hastened to go and collect the remnants of its\r\nfortune: loyalty was dying at the head, while its heart still beat in\r\nthe breasts of a few half-naked country-gentlemen. Mrs. Lindsay had\r\nleft; she wrote to Messrs, de Lamoignon to return; she also invited\r\nMadame d'Aguesseau[359], sister of Messrs, de Lamoignon, to cross the\r\nChannel. Fontaines wrote to me to finish the printing of the _Génie\r\ndu Christianisme_ in Paris. While remembering my country, I felt no\r\ndesire to see it again; gods more powerful than the paternal lares\r\nkept me back; I had neither goods nor refuge in France; my motherland\r\nhad become to me a bosom of stone, a breast without milk: I should not\r\nfind my mother there, nor my brother, nor my sister Julie. Lucile still\r\nlived, but she had married M. de Caud and no longer bore my name; my\r\nyoung \"widow\" knew me only through a union of a few months, through\r\nmisfortune and through an absence of eight years.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: George III.]\r\n\r\nHad I been left to myself, I do not know that I should have had\r\nthe strength to leave; but I saw my little circle dissolving; Madame\r\nd'Aguesseau proposed to take me to Paris: I let myself go. The\r\nPrussian Minister procured me a passport in the name of La Sagne, an\r\ninhabitant of Neuchâtel. Messrs. Dulau stopped the printing of the\r\n_Génie du Christianisme_, and gave me the sheets that had been set up.\r\nI separated the sketches of _Atala_ and _René_ from the _Natchez_; the\r\nremainder of the manuscript I locked into a trunk, of which I entrusted\r\nthe deposit to my hosts in London, and I set out for Dover with Madame\r\nd'Aguesseau: Mrs. Lindsay was awaiting us at Calais.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: I return to France.]\r\n\r\nIt was thus that I quitted England in 1800; my heart was differently\r\noccupied from the manner in which it is at the time of writing, in\r\n1822. I brought back from the land of exile only dreams and regrets;\r\nto-day my head is filled with scenes of ambition, of politics, of\r\ngrandeurs and Courts, so ill suited to my nature. How many events are\r\nheaped up in my present existence! Pass, men, pass; my turn will come.\r\nI have unrolled only one-third of my days before your eyes; if the\r\nsufferings which I have borne have weighed upon my vernal serenity,\r\nnow, entering upon a more fruitful age, the germ of _René_ is about\r\nto develop, and bitterness of another kind will be blended with my\r\nnarrative! What shall I not have to tell in speaking of my country;\r\nof her revolutions, of which I have already shown the fore-ground;\r\nof the Empire and of the gigantic man whom I have seen fall; of the\r\nRestoration in which I played so great a part, that Restoration\r\nglorious to-day, in 1822, although nevertheless I am able to see it\r\nonly through I know not what ill-omened mist?\r\n\r\nI end this book, which touches the spring of 1800. Arriving at the\r\nclose of my first career, I see opening before me the writer's career;\r\nfrom a private individual I am about to become a public man; I leave\r\nthe virginal and silent retreat of solitude to enter the dusty and\r\nnoisy cross-roads of the world; broad day is about to light up my\r\ndreamy life, light to penetrate my kingdom of shadows. I cast a melting\r\nglance upon those books which contain my unremembered hours; I seem to\r\nbe bidding a last farewell to the paternal house; I take leave of the\r\nthoughts and illusions of my youth as of sisters, of loving women, whom\r\nI leave by the family hearth and whom I shall see no more.\r\n\r\nWe took four hours to cross from Dover to Calais. I stole into my\r\ncountry under the shelter of a foreign name: doubly hidden beneath the\r\nobscurity of the Swiss La Sagne and my own, I entered France with the\r\ncentury[360].\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[247] This book was written in London between April and September 1822,\r\nand revised in February 1845.--T.\r\n\r\n[248] Cat.

Walking this morning on the cliffs\r\nbehind Dieppe Castle, I saw the postern which communicates with\r\nthe cliffs by means of a bridge thrown over a ditch: Madame de\r\nLongueville[362] escaped by that way from Queen Anne of Austria[363];\r\nembarking secretly at the Havre, she landed at Rotterdam, and joined\r\nthe Maréchal de Turenne[364] at Stenay. The great captain's laurels\r\nwere no longer innocent, and the fair but caustic outlaw treated the\r\nculprit none too well.\r\n\r\nMadame de Longueville, who had recovered from the Hôtel de Rambouillet,\r\nthe Throne of Versailles, and the Municipality of Paris, became smitten\r\nwith the author of the _Maximes_[365], and was as faithful to him as\r\nshe was able. The latter lives less by his \"thoughts\" than by the\r\nfriendship of Madame de La Fayette[366], Madame de Sévigné, the verses\r\nof La Fontaine, and the love of Madame de Longueville: see whither\r\nillustrious attachments lead.\r\n\r\nThe Princesse de Condé[367], when on the point of death, said to Madame\r\nde Brienne[368]:\r\n\r\n    \"My dear friend, acquaint that poor wretch who is at Stenay\r\n    of the state in which you see me, and let her learn how to\r\n    die.\"\r\n\r\nFine words; but the Princess forgot that she herself had been loved by\r\nHenry IV., and that, when her husband carried her to Brussels, she had\r\nwanted to rejoin the Bearnese, \"to escape at night by a window, and\r\nthen to do thirty or forty leagues on horse-back;\" she was at that time\r\na \"poor wretch\" of seventeen.\r\n\r\nDescending the cliff, I found myself on the high-road to Paris; it\r\nascends swiftly on leaving Dieppe. On the right, on the rising slope\r\nof a bank, stands the wall of a cemetery; by the side of that wall was\r\nfixed the wheel of a rope-walk. Two rope-spinners, walking backwards\r\nin line, and swinging from leg to leg, were softly singing together. I\r\nlistened: they had come to that couplet of the _Vieux caporal_, a fine\r\npoetic lie, which has brought us to our present state:\r\n\r\n    Qui là-bas sanglote et regarde?\r\n    Eh! c'est la veuve du tambour, etc[369].\r\n\r\nThose men uttered the refrain:\r\n\r\n    Conscrits au pas; ne pleurez pas\r\n    . . . Marchez au pas, au pas[370],\r\n\r\nin a voice so manly and so pathetic that the tears came to my eyes.\r\nWhilst themselves keeping step and twisting their hemp, they appeared\r\nto be spinning out the old corporal's dying moments: there was\r\nsomething, I cannot say what, in that glory peculiar to Béranger, thus\r\nlonesomely revealed by two sailors singing a soldier's death within\r\nview of the sea.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Dieppe.]\r\n\r\nThe cliff reminded me of a monarchical greatness, the road of\r\na plebeian celebrity: I compared in thought the men at the two\r\nextremities of society, and I asked myself to which of those eras\r\nI should have preferred to belong. When the present shall have\r\ndisappeared like the past, which of those two renowns will the most\r\nattract the notice of posterity?\r\n\r\nAnd yet, if facts were all, if, in history, the value of names did\r\nnot counterbalance the value of events, what a difference between my\r\ntime and the time which elapsed between the deaths of Henry IV. and\r\nMazarin[371]! What are the troubles of 1648 compared to that Revolution\r\nwhich has devoured the old world, of which it, the Revolution, will die\r\nperhaps, leaving behind it neither an old nor a new state of society?\r\nHad not I to paint in my Memoirs pictures of incomparably higher\r\nimportance than the scenes related by the Duc de La Rochefoucauld[372]?\r\nAt Dieppe itself, what was the careless and voluptuous idol of seduced\r\nand rebellious Paris by the side of Madame la Duchesse de Berry[373]?\r\nThe salvoes of artillery which announced to the sea the presence of the\r\nroyal widow resound no longer[374]; the flattery of powder and smoke\r\nhas left nothing upon the shore save the moaning of the waves.\r\n\r\nThe two daughters of Bourbon, Anne Geneviève and Marie Caroline, have\r\ndeparted; the two sailors singing the song of the plebeian poet will\r\nplunge into the abyss; Dieppe no longer contains myself: it was another\r\n\"I,\" an \"I\" of my early days, now past, that formerly inhabited these\r\nregions, and that \"I\" has succumbed, for our days die before ourselves.\r\nHere you have seen me, a sub-lieutenant in the Navarre Regiment,\r\ndrilling recruits on the pebbles; you have seen me here again, exiled\r\nunder Bonaparte; you shall find me here again when the days of July\r\nsurprise me in this place. Behold me here once more; I here resume my\r\npen to continue my confessions.\r\n\r\nIn order that we may understand one another, it is well to cast a\r\nglance at the present state of my Memoirs.\r\n\r\n*\r\n\r\nWhat happens to every contractor working on a large scale has happened\r\nto me: I have, in the first place, built the outer wings of my\r\nedifice, and then, removing and restoring my scaffoldings in different\r\npositions, I have raised the stone and the mortar for the intermediate\r\nstructures: it used to take several centuries to complete a Gothic\r\ncathedral. If Heaven grant me life, the work will be finished by\r\nstages of my various years; the architect, always the same, will have\r\nchanged only in age. For the rest, it is a punishment to preserve one's\r\nintellectual being intact, imprisoned in a worn-out material covering.\r\nSt Augustine, feeling that his clay was falling from him, said to God,\r\n\"Be Thou a tabernacle unto my soul,\" and to men he said, \"When you\r\nshall have known me in this book, pray for me.\"\r\n\r\nThirty-six years must be reckoned between the things which commence\r\nmy Memoirs and those upon which I am now engaged. How shall I resume\r\nwith any spirit the narration of a subject formerly replete for me\r\nwith passion and fire, when it is no longer with living beings that I\r\nam about to converse, when it becomes a question of arousing lifeless\r\neffigies from the depths of Eternity, of descending into a funeral\r\nvault there to play at life? Am I not myself almost dead? Have my\r\nopinions not changed? Do I see objects from the same point of view?\r\nHave not the general and prodigious events which have accompanied or\r\nfollowed the personal events that so greatly perturbed me diminished\r\ntheir importance in the eyes of the world, as well as in my own eyes?\r\nWhosoever prolongs his career feels his hours grow cold; he no longer\r\nfinds on the morrow the interest which he felt on the eve. When I\r\nseek in my thoughts, there are names and even persons that escape my\r\nmemory, and yet they may have caused my heart to throb: vanity of man\r\nforgetting and forgotten! It is not enough to say to one's dreams, to\r\nlove, \"Revive!\" for them to come to life again: the realm of shadows\r\ncan be opened only with the golden bough, and it needs a young hand to\r\npluck it.\r\n\r\n    _Aucuns venants des Lares patries_[375].\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Aspect of France in 1800.]\r\n\r\nImprisoned for eight years in Great Britain, I had seen only the\r\nEnglish world, so different, especially at that time, from the European\r\nworld. As the Dover packet approached Calais, in the spring of 1800,\r\nmy gaze preceded me on shore. I was struck by the needy aspect of the\r\ncountry: scarce a few masts were to be seen in the harbour; inhabitants\r\nin carmagnole jackets and cotton caps came along the jetty to meet\r\nus: the conquerors of the Continent made themselves known to me by a\r\nclatter of wooden shoes. When we came alongside, the gendarmes and\r\ncustom-house officers leapt on deck to inspect our luggage and our\r\npassports: in France a man is always suspected, and the first thing we\r\nperceive in our business, as well as in our amusements, is a cocked hat\r\nor a bayonet.\r\n\r\nMrs. Lindsay was waiting for us at the inn; the next day we set out\r\nwith her for Paris: Madame d'Aguesseau, a young kinswoman of hers, and\r\nI. On the road one saw hardly any men; blackened and sun-burnt women,\r\nbare-footed, their heads bare or covered with a kerchief, were tilling\r\nthe fields: one would have taken them for slaves. I ought rather to\r\nhave been struck by the independence and virility of that land where\r\nthe women wielded the mattock while the men wielded the musket. The\r\nvillages looked as though a conflagration had passed over them; they\r\nwere wretched and half demolished: mud or dust on every hand, dunghills\r\nand rubbish-heaps.\r\n\r\nTo the right and left of the road appeared overthrown country mansions;\r\nof their levelled thickets there remained only some squared trunks,\r\nupon which children played. One saw battered enclosure walls, deserted\r\nchurches, from which the dead had been expelled, steeples without\r\nbells, cemeteries without crosses, headless saints that had been\r\nstoned in their niches. The walls were smeared with those Republican\r\ninscriptions that had already grown old: LIBERTY, EQUALITY, FRATERNITY,\r\nOR DEATH. Sometimes they had attempted to efface the word DEATH, but\r\nthe red or black letters showed through the coating of lime. This\r\nnation, which seemed on the point of extinction, was commencing a new\r\nworld, like those peoples which issued from the dusk of the savagery\r\nand destruction of the Middle Ages.\r\n\r\nApproaching the capital, between Écouen and Paris, the elms had not\r\nbeen cut down; I was struck by those fine roadside avenues, unknown on\r\nEnglish soil. France was as new to me, as in former days, the forests\r\nof America. Saint-Denis was laid bare, its windows were broken; the\r\nrain penetrated into its grass-grown naves, and there were no more\r\ntombs: I have since seen there the bones of Louis XVI., the Cossacks,\r\nthe coffin of the Duc de Berry, and the catafalque of Louis XVIII.\r\n\r\nAuguste de Lamoignon came to meet Mrs. Lindsay. His well-appointed\r\ncarriage formed a contrast with the clumsy carts, the dirty,\r\nbroken-down diligences, drawn by hacks harnessed with ropes, which I\r\nhad met since leaving Calais. Mrs. Lindsay lived at the Ternes. I was\r\nput down on the Chemin de la Révolte, and made my way to my hostess'\r\nhouse across the fields. I stayed with her for four-and-twenty hours; I\r\nthere met a great fat Monsieur Lasalle, whom she employed in arranging\r\nemigrant business. She sent to inform M. de Fontanes of my arrival; in\r\neight-and-forty hours he came to fetch me in a little room which Mrs.\r\nLindsay had hired for me at an inn almost at her door.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Paris once more.]\r\n\r\nIt was a Sunday: we entered Paris on foot by the Barrière de l'Étoile\r\nat about three o'clock in the afternoon. We have no idea to-day of\r\nthe impression which the excesses of the Revolution had made on men's\r\nminds in Europe, and chiefly among those absent from France during the\r\nTerror: I felt literally as though I were about to descend into Hell.\r\nI had, it is true, witnessed the beginnings of the Revolution; but the\r\ngreat crimes had then not yet been accomplished, and I had remained\r\nunder the yoke of subsequent events as these had been related in the\r\nmidst of the peaceful and orderly society of England.\r\n\r\nProceeding under my false name, and convinced that I was compromising\r\nmy friend Fontanes, to my great astonishment, on entering the\r\nChamps-Élysées, I heard the sound of violins, horns, clarionets and\r\ndrums. I saw public balls, at which men and women were dancing; farther\r\non, the Tuileries Palace appeared to my eyes, against the background\r\nof its two great clumps of chestnut-trees. As for the Place Louis\r\nXV.[376], it was bare: it had the decay, the melancholy and deserted\r\nlook of an old amphitheatre; one crossed it quickly; I was quite\r\nsurprised to hear no moans; I was afraid of stepping in the blood of\r\nwhich not a trace remained; my eyes could not tear themselves from\r\nthe place in the sky where the instrument of death had raised its\r\nhead; I thought I saw my brother and my sister-in-law in their shirts,\r\nstanding, bound, beside the blood-stained machine: it was there that\r\nthe head of Louis XVI. had fallen. In spite of the gaiety in the\r\nstreets the church-steeples were dumb; it seemed to me as though I had\r\nreturned on the day of infinite sorrow, on Good Friday.\r\n\r\nM. de Fontanes lived in the Rue Saint-Honoré, near Saint-Roch. He took\r\nme home with him, introduced me to his wife, and then took me to his\r\nfriend, M. Joubert, where I found a temporary shelter: I was received\r\nlike a traveller of whom one has heard speak.\r\n\r\nThe next day I went to the police, under the name of La Sagne, to\r\nlodge my foreign passport and to receive in exchange a permit to\r\nremain in Paris, which was renewed from month to month. In a few days\r\nI hired an _entre-sol_ in the Rue de Lille, on the side of the Rue des\r\nSaints-Pères.\r\n\r\nI had brought with me the _Génie du Christianisme_ and the first sheets\r\nof the work, printed in London. I was directed to M. Migneret[377], a\r\nworthy man, who consented to recommence the interrupted printing, and\r\nto advance me something to live on. Not a soul knew of my _Essai sur\r\nles révolutions_, notwithstanding what M. Lemierre had written to me. I\r\nunearthed the old philosopher, Delisle de Sales, who had just published\r\nhis _Mémoire en faveur de Dieu_, and went to call on Ginguené. He\r\nlodged in the Rue de Grenelle-Saint-Germain, near the Hôtel du Bon La\r\nFontaine. His porter's box still bore this inscription:\r\n\r\n    \"Here we honour each other with the title of citizen and say\r\n    thee and thou. Shut the door behind thee, if you please.\"\r\n\r\nI went up: M. Ginguené, who hardly recognised me, spoke to me from\r\nthe height of the grandeur of all that he was and had been. I humbly\r\nretired, and did not endeavour to renew such disproportionate relations.\r\n\r\nI continued at the bottom of my heart to cherish regretful memories\r\nof England; I had lived so long in that country that I had adopted\r\nits habits: I could not reconcile myself to the dirt of our houses,\r\nour staircases, our tables, to our uncleanliness, our noisiness, our\r\nfamiliarity, the indiscretion of our loquacity; I was English in\r\nmanners, in taste, and to a certain degree in thought; for, if, as it\r\nis said, Lord Byron sometimes drew inspiration for his _Childe-Harold_\r\nfrom _René_ it is also true to say that my eight years' residence\r\nin Great Britain, preceded by a journey in America, together with\r\nmy long habit of talking, writing, and even thinking in English,\r\nhad necessarily influenced the turn and expression of my ideas. But\r\ngradually I came to relish the good-fellowship for which we are\r\ndistinguished, that charming, swift, easy commerce of thought, that\r\nutter absence of arrogance and prejudice, that heedlessness of fortune\r\nand names, that natural level of all ranks, that equality of mind which\r\nmakes French society incomparable and redeems our faults: after a few\r\nmonths' residence among us, one feels that he can no longer live except\r\nin Paris.\r\n\r\n*\r\n\r\nI locked myself into my _entre-sol_ and gave myself up entirely to\r\nwork. In my intervals of rest, I went and reconnoitred in various\r\ndirections. The Circus in the middle of the Palais-Royal had been\r\nfilled up; Camille Desmoulins no longer held forth in the open air; one\r\nno longer saw bands of prostitutes going round, virginal attendants of\r\nthe goddess Reason, and walking under the conduct of David, costumier\r\nand corybant. At the outlet of each alley, in the galleries, one met\r\nmen crying sights: \"galanty shows,\" \"peep-shows,\" \"physical cabinets,\"\r\n\"strange animals;\" in spite of all the heads that had been cut off,\r\nidlers still remained. From the cellars of the Palais-Marchand came\r\nbursts of music, accompanied by the double diapason of the big\r\ndrums: it was perhaps there that dwelt the giants whom I sought, and\r\nwhom immense events must necessarily have produced. I went down: an\r\nunderground ball was jigging amidst seated spectators drinking beer.\r\nA little hunchback, perched on a table, played the violin and sang a\r\nhymn to Bonaparte, which ended with these lines:\r\n\r\n    Par ses vertus, par ses attraits.\r\n    Il méritait d'être leur père[378]!\r\n\r\nHe was given a sou after the _ritornello._ Such is the ground-work of\r\nthe human society which bore Alexander and was then bearing Napoleon.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Changes in Paris.]\r\n\r\nI visited the places where I had taken the reveries of my early years.\r\nIn my old-time convents, the club-men had been driven out after\r\nthe monks. Wandering behind the Luxembourg, my footsteps led me to\r\nthe Chartreuse: its demolition was being completed. The Place des\r\nVictoires and the Place Vendôme mourned the missing effigies of the\r\nGreat King; the community-house of the Capuchins was sacked: the inner\r\ncloisters served as a retreat for Robertson's[379] dissolving views.\r\nAt the Cordeliers, I inquired in vain for the Gothic nave where I had\r\nseen Marat and Danton in their prime. On the Quai des Théatins[380],\r\nthe church of that Order[381] had been turned into a café and a\r\nrope-dancers' theatre. At the door was a coloured poster representing\r\nacrobats dancing on the tight-rope, with, in big letters, ADMISSION\r\nFREE. I elbowed my way among the crowd into that perfidious cave: I had\r\nno sooner taken my seat than waiters entered, napkin in hand, shouting\r\nlike mad-men--\r\n\r\n\"Give your orders, gentlemen, give your orders!\"\r\n\r\nI did not wait to be told a second time, and I pitiably made my\r\nescape amid the jeering cries of the assembly, because I had no money\r\nwherewith to \"give my orders.\"\r\n\r\n*\r\n\r\nThe Revolution has become divided into three parts which have nothing\r\nin common between them: the Republic, the Empire, and the Restoration;\r\nthose three different worlds, each as completely finished as the\r\nothers, seem separated by centuries. Each of these three worlds has had\r\nits fixed principle: the principle of the Republic was equality, that\r\nof the Empire force, that of the Restoration liberty. The Republican\r\nera is the most original, and has made the deepest impression because\r\nit has been unique in history: never had there been seen, nor ever will\r\nbe again, physical order produced by moral disorder, unity issuing from\r\nthe government of the multitude, the scaffold substituted for the law\r\nand obeyed in the name of humanity.\r\n\r\nIn 1801, I assisted at the second social transformation. The jumble was\r\na strange one: by an agreed travesty, a host of people became persons\r\nwho they were not; each carried his assumed or borrowed name hung\r\nround his neck, as the Venetians at the carnival carry a little mask\r\nin their hand to show that they are masked. One was reputed an Italian\r\nor a Spaniard, another a Prussian or a Dutchman: I was a Swiss. The\r\nmother passed for her son's aunt, the father for his daughter's uncle;\r\nthe owner of an estate was only its steward. This movement reminded\r\nme, in an opposite sense, of the movement of 1789, when the monks and\r\nreligious issued from their cloisters and the old society was invaded\r\nby the new: the latter, after supplanting the former, was supplanted in\r\nits turn.\r\n\r\nNevertheless, the orderly world commenced to spring up again; people\r\nleft the cafés and the streets to return to their houses; they gathered\r\ntogether the remains of their family; they readjusted their inheritance\r\nby collecting its remnants, as, after a battle, the troop is beaten\r\nand the losses counted. Such churches as remained whole were opened:\r\nI had the happiness to sound the trumpet at the gate of the Temple.\r\nOne distinguished the old republican generations which were retiring,\r\nimperial generations which were coming to the front Generals of the\r\nRequisition[382], poor, rude of speech, stern of mien, who, from all\r\ntheir campaigns, had brought back nothing save wounds and ragged\r\ncoats, passed officers glittering with the gold lace of the Consular\r\nArmy. The returned Emigrant chatted quietly with the assassins of some\r\nof his kindred. The porters, all great partisans of the late M. de\r\nRobespierre, regretted the sights on the Place Louis XV., where they\r\ncut off the heads of \"women who,\" my own _concierge_ in the Rue de\r\nLille told me, \"had necks white as chicken's flesh.\"\r\n\r\nThe men of September, changing their names and their districts, sold\r\nbaked potatoes at the street-corners; but they were often obliged to\r\npack off, because the people, recognising them, upset their stalls\r\nand tried to kill them. The Revolutionaries who had waxed rich began\r\nto move into the great mansions of the Faubourg Saint-Germain that\r\nhad been sold. On the road to become barons and counts, the Jacobins\r\nspoke only of the horrors of 1793, of the necessity for chastising the\r\nproletarians and putting down the excesses of the populace. Bonaparte,\r\nplacing the Brutuses and Scævolas in his police, was preparing to\r\nbedizen them with ribands, to befoul them with titles, to force them\r\nto betray their opinions and dishonour their crimes. Amid all this,\r\nsprang up a vigorous generation sown in blood and growing up to shed\r\nnone save that of the foreigner: from day to day, the metamorphosis was\r\naccomplished which turned Republicans into Imperialists and the tyranny\r\nof all into the despotism of one.\r\n\r\n*\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: My letter to Madame de Staël.]\r\n\r\nWhile occupied in curtailing, expanding, altering the sheets of the\r\n_Génie du Christianisme_, I was driven by necessity to busy myself with\r\nother work. M. de Fontanes was then editing the _Mercure de France_:\r\nhe suggested that I should write in that paper. These combats were not\r\nwithout a certain danger: the only way to touch politics was through\r\nliterature, and half a word was enough for Bonaparte's police. A\r\nsingular circumstance, which prevented me from sleeping, lengthened my\r\nhours and gave me more leisure. I had bought two turtle-doves; they\r\ncooed a great deal: I enclosed them in vain at night in my little\r\ntravelling-trunk; they only cooed the more. In one of the moments of\r\nsleeplessness which they caused me, I bethought myself of writing for\r\nthe _Mercure_ a letter to Madame de Staël[383]. This freak caused me\r\nsuddenly to emerge from the shade; a few pages in a newspaper did what\r\nmy two thick volumes on the Revolution had been unable to do. My head\r\nshowed a little above obscurity.\r\n\r\nThis first success seemed to foretell that which was to follow. I was\r\nengaged in correcting the proofs of _Atala_ (an episode contained, as\r\nwas _René_, in the _Génie du Christianisme_), when I perceived that\r\nsome sheets were missing. I was seized with fright: I thought they had\r\nstolen my novel, assuredly a very ill-founded dread, for no one thought\r\nthat I was worth robbing. Be this as it may, I determined to publish\r\n_Atala_ separately, and I declared my resolution in a letter addressed\r\nto the _Journal des Débats_[384] and the _Publiciste._\r\n\r\nBefore venturing to expose the work to the light of day, I showed it to\r\nM. de Fontanes: he had already read fragments of it in manuscript in\r\nLondon. When he came to Father Aubry's speech beside Atala's deathbed,\r\nhe said brusquely, in a rough voice:\r\n\r\n\"That's not right; it's bad: write that over again!\"\r\n\r\nI went away disconsolate; I did not feel capable of doing better. I\r\nwanted to throw the whole thing into the fire; I spent from eight till\r\neleven o'clock in the evening in my entresol, seated at my table, with\r\nmy forehead resting on the back of my hands opened and spread out over\r\nmy paper. I was angry with Fontanes; I was angry with myself; I did not\r\neven try to write, so great was my despair of self. Towards midnight, I\r\nheard the voice of my turtle-doves, softened by distance and rendered\r\nmore plaintive by the prison in which I kept them confined: inspiration\r\nreturned to me; I then and there wrote the speech of the missionary,\r\nwithout a single interlineation, without erasing a word, just as it\r\nremained and as it stands to-day. With a beating heart, I took it in\r\nthe morning to Fontanes, who exclaimed:\r\n\r\n\"That's it, that's right! I told you you could do better!\"\r\n\r\nThe noise which I have made in this world dates from the publication\r\nof _Atala._[385] I ceased to live for myself and my public career\r\ncommenced. After so many military successes, a literary success seemed\r\na prodigy: people were hungering for it. The uncommon nature of the\r\nwork added to the surprise of the crowd. _Atala_, falling into the\r\nmidst of the literature of the Empire, of that classic school whose\r\nvery sight, like that of a rejuvenated old woman, inspired boredom, was\r\na sort of production of an unknown kind. People did not know whether\r\nto class it among the \"monstrosities\" or among the \"beauties:\" was it\r\na Gorgon or a Venus? The assembled academicians discoursed learnedly\r\nupon its sex and its nature, in the same way as they made reports\r\nupon the _Génie du Christianisme._ The old century rejected, the new\r\nwelcomed it.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Napoléon.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: I publish _Atala._]\r\n\r\n_Atala_ became so popular that, with the Brinvilliers[386] she went\r\nto swell Curtius' collection[387]. The wagoners' inns were decorated\r\nwith red, green and blue prints representing Chactas, Father Aubry,\r\nand the daughter of Simaghan. My characters were displayed in wax, in\r\nwooden boxes, on the quays, as images of the Virgin and the saints\r\nare displayed at the fair. In a boulevard theatre, I saw my savage\r\nwoman, in a headdress of cock's feathers, talking to a savage of her\r\nown kind of \"the soul of solitude,\" in a way that brought the sweat to\r\nmy brow with confusion. At the Variétés, they played a piece in which\r\na little girl and a little boy, leaving their boarding-school, went\r\noff by track-boat to get married in a small town; as, on landing, they\r\nspoke with a wild look of nothing but crocodiles, storks and forests,\r\ntheir parents thought that they had gone mad. I was overwhelmed with\r\nparodies, caricatures and ridicule. The Abbé Morellet, in order to\r\nconfound me, took his maid-servant on his knees and was unable to\r\nhold the young virgin's feet in his hands, as Chactas held Atala's\r\nfeet during the storm: if the Chactas of the Rue d'Anjou had had his\r\nportrait painted in this attitude, I would have forgiven him his\r\ncriticism.\r\n\r\nAll this bustle served to increase the fuss attendant upon my\r\nappearance. I became the fashion. My head was turned: I was\r\nunaccustomed to the delights of self-love and became intoxicated with\r\nit I loved fame like a woman, like a first love. And yet, coward that I\r\nwas, my affright equalled my passion: I was a conscript and stood the\r\nfire badly. My natural timidity, the doubts I have always had of my\r\ntalent, made me humble in the midst of my triumphs. I shrank from my\r\nsplendour; I wandered in lonely places, trying to extinguish the halo\r\nwith which my head was crowned. In the evenings, with my hat thrust\r\ndown over my eyes, lest the great man should be recognised, I went\r\nto a public smoking-room to read my praises in secret, in some small,\r\nunknown paper. Alone with my renown, I prolonged my walks as far as the\r\nsteam-pump at Chaillot[388], on the same road where I had suffered so\r\nmuch on going to Court: I was no more at my ease with my new honours.\r\nWhen my superiority dined for thirty sous in the Latin Quarter it\r\nswallowed its food the wrong way, troubled as it was by the staring of\r\nwhich it thought itself the object. I watched myself, I said to myself:\r\n\r\n\"And yet it is you, extraordinary being, eating like any one else!\"\r\n\r\nIn the Champs-Élysées was a café which I liked because of some\r\nnightingales which hung in a cage inside the coffee-room; Madame\r\nRousseau, who kept the place, knew me by sight, without knowing who\r\nI was. At ten o'clock in the evening, they used to bring me a cup of\r\ncoffee, and I looked for _Atala_ in the _Petites-Affiches_, to the\r\nsound of the voices of my half-dozen Philomelas. Alas! I soon saw poor\r\nMadame Rousseau die; our society of the nightingales and of the fair\r\nIndian who sang, \"Sweet habit of loving, so needful to life!\" lasted\r\nbut a moment.\r\n\r\nIf success had no power to prolong in me this stupid infatuation of\r\nvanity, or to pervert my reason, it was attended with dangers of\r\nanother kind: those dangers increased on the appearance of the _Génie\r\ndu Christianisme_ and on my resignation after the death of the Duc\r\nd'Enghien. Then came thronging around me, together with the young\r\nwomen who cry over novels, the crowd of Christian women, and those\r\nother noble enthusiasts whose breast beats high at the sight of an\r\nhonourable action. The young girls of thirteen or fourteen were the\r\nmost dangerous; for, knowing neither what they want nor what they want\r\nwith you, they enticingly mingle your image with a multitude of fables,\r\nribbons and flowers. Jean Jacques Rousseau speaks of the declarations\r\nwhich he received on the publication of the _Nouvelle Héloïse_[389] and\r\nof the conquests which were offered him: I do not know if empires would\r\nhave been thus yielded to me, but I do know that I was buried beneath a\r\nheap of scented notes; if those notes were not, to-day, notes from so\r\nmany grand-mothers, I should be puzzled how to relate, with becoming\r\nmodesty, how they fought for a line in my hand, how they picked up an\r\nenvelope addressed by me, and how, blushing and with lowered head,\r\nthey hid it beneath a flowing veil of long tresses. If I have not been\r\nspoilt, it must be because my nature is good.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: And become the fashion.]\r\n\r\nWhether from genuine politeness or inquisitive weakness, I sometimes\r\nwent so far as to think myself obliged to call and thank the unknown\r\nladies who signed the flattery they addressed to me with their names.\r\nOne day, I found a bewitching creature under her mother's wing, on a\r\nfourth floor, where I have never set foot since. A fair Pole received\r\nme in silk-hung rooms; half-odalisk, half-Valkyrie, she looked like\r\na snowdrop with its white flowers, or like one of those graceful\r\nheather-blooms which replace the other daughters of Flora when the\r\nseason of the latter has not yet come or has passed: that female\r\nchorus, varied in age and beauty, was the realisation of my former\r\nsylph. The two-fold effect upon my vanity and my feelings was so much\r\nthe more to be dreaded inasmuch as, until then, excepting one serious\r\nattachment, I had been neither sought out nor distinguished by the\r\ncrowd. At the same time I am bound to say that, even though it were\r\neasy for me to take advantage of a passing illusion, my sincerity\r\nrevolted against the idea of a voluptuousness that would have come to\r\nme by the chaste paths of religion: to be loved through the _Génie du\r\nChristianisme_, loved for the _Extrème Onction_, loved for the _Fête\r\ndes Morts!_ I could never have been so shameful a Tartuffe.\r\n\r\nI knew a Provençal physician, Dr. Vigaroux[390]; he had arrived at an\r\nage when every pleasure means the loss of a day, and he said \"that\r\nhe had no regret for the time thus lost; without troubling himself\r\nwhether he gave the happiness which he received, he went towards the\r\ndeath of which he hoped to make his last delight.\" Nevertheless, I was\r\na witness of his poor tears when he breathed his last; he could not\r\nhide his affliction from me; it was too late: his white hairs were\r\nnot long enough to conceal and wipe away his tears. The only one to\r\nbe really unhappy on leaving the earth is the unbeliever: for the man\r\nwithout faith, existence is terrible in this, that it carries a sense\r\nof annihilation; if one had not been born, he would not experience\r\nthe horror of ceasing to be: the life of the atheist is a frightful\r\nlightning-flash, which serves but to reveal an abyss.\r\n\r\nO great and merciful God, Thou hast not cast us upon earth for unworthy\r\ntroubles and a miserable happiness! Our inevitable disenchantment\r\nadmonishes us that our destinies are more sublime. Whatever may have\r\nbeen our errors, if we have preserved a serious spirit and thought of\r\nThee in the midst of our weaknesses, we shall, whenever Thy goodness\r\nsets us free, be carried to that region where attachments endure for\r\never!\r\n\r\n*\r\n\r\nIt was not long before I received the punishment of my literary\r\nvanity, the most detestable of all, if not the most foolish: I had\r\nthought that I should be able to relish in _petto_ the satisfaction\r\nof being a sublime genius, not by wearing, as they do to-day, a beard\r\nand an eccentric coat, but by remaining dressed like decent people,\r\ndistinguished only by superiority. Useless hope! My pride was to be\r\nchastened; the correction was administered by the political persons\r\nwhom I was obliged to know: celebrity is a benefice with the cure of\r\nsouls.\r\n\r\nM. de Fontanes was acquainted with Madame Bacciochi[391]; he introduced\r\nme to Bonaparte's sister, and soon after to the First Consul's brother\r\nLucien[392]. The latter had a country-place near Senlis le Plessis,\r\nwhere I was coerced to go and dine; the château had once belonged to\r\nthe Cardinal de Bernis[393]. Lucien had in his garden the tomb of his\r\nfirst wife[394], a lady half German and half Spanish, and the memory of\r\nthe poet-cardinal. The nutrient nymph of a stream dug with the spade\r\nwas a mule which drew water from a well: that was the commencement of\r\nall the rivers which Bonaparte was to cause to flow in his Empire.\r\nEfforts were being made to have my name struck off the lists; I was\r\nalready called, and called myself aloud, Chateaubriand, forgetting\r\nthat I ought to call myself Lassagne. Emigrants came to see me: among\r\nothers, Messrs, de Bonald[395] and de Chênedollé[396]. Christian de\r\nLamoignon, my companion in exile in London, took me to Madame Récamier:\r\nthe curtain fell suddenly between her and me.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The Comtesse de Beaumont.]\r\n\r\nThe person who filled the largest place in my existence, on my\r\nreturn from the Emigration, was Madame la Comtesse de Beaumont[397].\r\nShe lived during a part of the year at the Château de Passy, near\r\nVilleneuve-sur-Yonne, which M. Joubert inhabited during the summer.\r\nMadame de Beaumont returned to Paris, and expressed a wish to meet me.\r\n\r\nSo that my life might be one long chain of regrets, Providence willed\r\nit that the first person who received me kindly at the outset of my\r\npublic career should also be the first to disappear. Madame de Beaumont\r\nopens the funeral procession of those women who have passed away before\r\nme. My most distant memories rest upon ashes, and they have continued\r\nto fall from grave to grave: like the Indian pundit, I recite the\r\nprayers for the dead until the flowers of my chaplet are faded.\r\n\r\nMadame de Beaumont was the daughter of Armand Marc de Saint-Hérem,\r\nComte de Montmorin, French Ambassador in Madrid, commandant in\r\nBrittany, member of the Assembly of Notables in 1787, and Foreign\r\nMinister under Louis XVI., by whom he was much liked: he perished on\r\nthe scaffold, where he was followed by a portion of his family[398].\r\n\r\nMadame de Beaumont was ill rather than well-favoured, and very like\r\nher portrait by Madame Lebrun[399]. Her face was thin and pale; her\r\neyes were almond-shaped and would have perhaps been too brilliant, if\r\nan extraordinary suavity of expression had not half extinguished her\r\nglances and caused them to shine languidly, as a ray of light becomes\r\nmellowed by passing through crystal water. Her character had a sort of\r\nrigidity and impatience, which arose from the strength of her feelings\r\nand from the inward suffering which she experienced. Endowed with\r\nloftiness of soul and great courage, she was born for the world, from\r\nwhich her spirit had withdrawn through choice and unhappiness; but when\r\na friendly voice evoked that secluded intelligence, it came and spoke\r\nto you in words from Heaven. Madame de Beaumont's extreme weakness\r\nmade her slow of expression, and this slowness was touching. I knew\r\nthis afflicted woman only at the moment of her flight; she was already\r\nstricken with death, and I devoted myself to her sufferings. I had\r\ntaken a lodging in the Rue Saint-Honoré, at the Hôtel d'Étampes, near\r\nthe Rue Neuve-du-Luxembourg. In this latter street, Madame de Beaumont\r\noccupied an apartment looking out upon the gardens of the Ministry\r\nof Justice. I called to see her every evening, with her friends\r\nand mine, M. Joubert, M. de Fontanes, M. de Bonald, M. Molé[400],\r\nM. Pasquier[401], M. de Chênedollé, men who have filled a place in\r\nliterature and public life.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Joseph Joubert.]\r\n\r\nFull of oddities and eccentricities, M. Joubert will be an eternal\r\nloss to those who knew him. He had an extraordinary grip upon one's\r\nmind and heart; and, when once he had seized hold of you, his image\r\nwas there, like a fixed thought, like an obsession that refused to be\r\ndriven away. He made great pretensions to calmness, and no one was\r\nso easily perturbed as he: he watched himself in order to stop those\r\nemotions of the mind, which he thought injurious to his health, and\r\nconstantly his friends came and disturbed the precautions which he\r\nhad taken to keep well, for he could not prevent himself from being\r\naffected by their sadness or joy: he was an egoist who troubled himself\r\nonly about others. In order to recover his strength, he often thought\r\nhimself obliged to close his eyes and refrain from speaking for hours\r\nat a time. Heaven knows what noise and movement passed inwardly within\r\nhim during this repose and silence which he laid upon himself. M.\r\nJoubert at every moment changed his diet and regimen, living one day\r\non milk, another on minced meat, causing himself to be jolted at full\r\nspeed over the roughest roads, or drawn at a snail's pace along the\r\nsmoothest alleys. When he read, he tore out of his books the leaves\r\nwhich displeased him, thus forming a library for his own use, composed\r\nof scooped-out works, contained in bindings too large for them.\r\n\r\nA profound metaphysician, his philosophy, thanks to an elaboration\r\npeculiar to himself, became painting or poetry; a Plato with the heart\r\nof a La Fontaine, he had formed an idea of perfection which prevented\r\nhim from finishing anything. In manuscripts found after his death, he\r\nsaid:\r\n\r\n\"I am like an Æolian harp, which gives forth a few beautiful sounds\r\nand plays no tune.\"\r\n\r\nMadame Victorine de Chastenay[402] maintained that \"he had the\r\nappearance of a soul which had met with a body by accident, and put up\r\nwith it as best it could:\" a definition both charming and true.\r\n\r\nWe laughed at the enemies of M. de Fontanes, who tried to pass him off\r\nfor a deep and dissembling politician: he was simply an irascible poet,\r\nfrank to the pitch of anger, with a mind hedged in by contrariety, and\r\nas little able to conceal its opinion as to accept that of others. The\r\nliterary principles of his friend Joubert were not his: the latter\r\nfound some good everywhere and in every writer; Fontanes, on the\r\ncontrary, held such and such a doctrine in abhorrence, and could not\r\nhear the names mentioned of certain authors. He was the sworn enemy of\r\nthe principles of modern composition: to place before the reader's\r\neyes material action, the crime at work or the gibbet with its rope,\r\nseemed to him so many enormities; he maintained that objects should\r\nnever be seen except amid poetic surroundings, as though under a\r\ncrystal globe. Sorrow spending itself mechanically through the eyes\r\nseemed to him a sensation fit only for the Cirque or the Grève; he\r\nunderstood the tragic sentiment only as ennobled by admiration and\r\nchanged, through the medium of art, into \"a charming pity.\" I quoted\r\nthe Greek vases to him: in the arabesques of those vases one sees\r\nHector's body drawn behind the car of Achilles, while a little figure,\r\nflying in the air, represents the shade of Patrocles, consoled by the\r\nvengeance of the son of Thetis.\r\n\r\n\"Well, Joubert,\" cried Fontanes, \"what do you say to that metamorphosis\r\nof the muse? How those Greeks respected the soul!\"\r\n\r\nJoubert thought himself attacked, and placed Fontanes in contradiction\r\nwith himself by reproaching him with his indulgence for me.\r\n\r\nThese discussions, highly comical as they often were, never came to an\r\nend: one evening, at half-past eleven, when I lived on the Place Louis\r\nXV., in the attic floor of Madame de Coislin's house, Fontanes climbed\r\nup my eighty-four stairs again to come furiously, with many raps of his\r\ncane, to finish an argument which he had left interrupted: it concerned\r\nPicard[403], whom at that moment he placed far above Molière; he would\r\nhave taken good care not to have written a single word of what he said:\r\nFontanes talking and Fontanes pen in hand were two different men.\r\n\r\nIt was M. de Fontanes, I like to repeat, who encouraged my first\r\nattempts: it was he who announced the publication of the _Génie du\r\nChristianisme_; it was his muse which, full of astonished devotion,\r\ndirected mine in the new paths along which it had precipitated itself:\r\nhe taught me to conceal the deformity of objects by the manner of\r\nthrowing light upon them; to put classic language into the mouths of my\r\nromantic characters as far as in me lay.\r\n\r\nIn former days there were men who were guardians of taste, like the\r\ndragons who watched over the golden apples in the garden of the\r\nHesperides; they did not allow youth to enter until it was able to\r\ntouch the fruit without spoiling it.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: And other literary friends.]\r\n\r\nMy friend's writings take you by a happy road: the mind experiences\r\na sense of well-being, and finds itself in an harmonious situation\r\nwhere everything charms and nothing wounds. M. de Fontanes incessantly\r\nrevised his productions; none was more convinced than that master of\r\nthe old days of the excellence of the maxim, \"Hasten slowly.\" What,\r\nthen, would he say to-day when, both morally and physically, we exert\r\nourselves to do away with distances, and when we think we can never\r\ngo fast enough. M. de Fontanes preferred to travel at the will of a\r\ndelicious measure. You have read what I said of him when I found him\r\nin London; the regrets which I expressed then I must repeat now: life\r\nobliges us ever to weep in anticipation or in remembrance.\r\n\r\nM. de Bonald had a shrewd intelligence; his ingenuity was mistaken for\r\ngenius; he had dreamt out his political metaphysics with the Army of\r\nCondé, in the Black Forest, in the same way as those Jena and Göttingen\r\nprofessors who have since marched at the head of their pupils and let\r\nthemselves be killed for the liberty of Germany. An innovator, although\r\nhe had been a musketeer under Louis XVI., he looked upon the ancients\r\nas children in politics and literature; and he maintained, while he was\r\nthe first to employ the fatuousness of the language now in use, that\r\nthe Grand-master of the University was \"not yet sufficiently advanced\r\nto understand that.\"\r\n\r\nChênedollé, with knowledge and talent, not native but acquired, was so\r\nsad that he nicknamed himself the \"Crow[404]:\" he went freebooting in\r\nmy works. We had made a compact: I yielded him my skies, my mists,\r\nmy clouds; but it was arranged that he should leave me my zephyrs, my\r\nwaves, and my forests.\r\n\r\nI am now speaking only of my literary friends; as to my political\r\nfriends, I do not know whether I shall tell you about them: principles\r\nand speeches have sunk abysses between us!\r\n\r\nMadame Hocquart[405] and Madame de Vintimille[406] came to the meetings\r\nin the Rue Neuve-du-Luxembourg. Madame de Vintimille, one of the women\r\nof olden time, of whom few remain, went into the world and brought us\r\nnews of what was going on: I asked her if people were \"still building\r\ncities.\" The descriptions of little scandals upon which she entered\r\nwith a poignant but inoffensive raillery made us the more heartily\r\nappreciate our own security. Madame de Vintimille had been sung,\r\ntogether with her sister, by M. de La Harpe. Her language was guarded,\r\nher character restrained, her wit acquired; she had lived with Mesdames\r\nde Chevreuse[407], de Longueville, de La Vallière, de Maintenon[408],\r\nwith Madame Geoffrin[409] and Madame du Defiant[410]. She blended well\r\nwith a company whose charm depended upon the variety of its wits and\r\nthe combination of their different values. Madame Hocquart had been\r\nfondly loved by Madame de Beaumont's brother[411], who had occupied\r\nhimself with the lady of his thoughts to the very scaffold, as Aubiac\r\nhad gone to the gallows kissing a sleeve of soft blue velvet which\r\nremained to him from the favours of Margaret of Valois[412].\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Who are no more.]\r\n\r\nNever again will there assemble under the same roof so many\r\ndistinguished persons belonging to different ranks and of different\r\ndestinies, able to talk of the commonest as of the loftiest things: a\r\nsimplicity of speech which came not from poverty but from choice. It\r\nis perhaps the last company in which the French genius of olden time\r\nhas appeared. Among the new French will not be found that urbanity\r\nwhich is the fruit of education, and which was transformed by long\r\nusage into aptness of character. What has become of that company? Make\r\nplans, bring friends together: you but prepare for yourself an eternal\r\nmourning! Madame de Beaumont is no more, Joubert is no more, Chênedollé\r\nis no more, Madame de Vintimille is no more. I used to visit M. Joubert\r\nat Villeneuve during the vintage; I walked with him on the Yonne Hills;\r\nhe picked mushrooms in the copses, and I yellow saffron in the fields.\r\nWe talked of everything, and particularly of our friend Madame de\r\nBeaumont, for ever absent; we recalled the memory of our former hopes.\r\nAt night we returned to Villeneuve, a town surrounded by broken-down\r\nwalls, of the time of Philip Augustus[413], and by half-razed towers,\r\nfrom above which rose the smoke from the vintagers' hearths. Joubert\r\nshowed me, in the distance from the hill, a sandy path among the woods\r\nwhich he used to take when going to see his neighbour, who hid herself\r\nat the Château de Passy during the Terror.\r\n\r\nI have passed four or five times through the Senonais since the death\r\nof my dear host. I saw the hills from the high-road: Joubert walked\r\nthere no longer; I recognised the trees, the fields, the vines, the\r\nlittle heaps of stones on which we used to rest ourselves. Driving\r\nthrough Villeneuve, I have cast a glance on the deserted street and\r\nthe closed house of my friend. The last time when that happened, I was\r\ngoing on an embassy to Rome: ah, if he had been at home, I would have\r\ntaken him with me to Madame de Beaumont's grave! It has pleased God to\r\nopen a celestial Rome to M. Joubert, even better suited to his soul,\r\nwhich abandoned Platonism for Christianity. I shall not meet him again\r\nhere below:\r\n\r\n\"I shall go to him rather: but he shall not return to me[414].\"\r\n\r\nThe success of _Atala_ having decided me to start afresh on the _Génie\r\ndu Christianisme_, of which two volumes were already in print, Madame\r\nde Beaumont offered to give me a room in the country, in a house which\r\nshe had hired at Savigny[415]. I spent six months with her in this\r\nretreat, with M. Joubert and our other friends.\r\n\r\nThe house stood at the entrance to the village, on the Paris side,\r\nnear an old high-road known in that part as the Chemin de Henri IV.:\r\nit leant against a vine-clad slope, and faced Savigny Park, ending in\r\na wooded screen, and crossed by the little River Orge. On the left,\r\nthe plain of Viry spread out as far as the springs of Juvisy. In every\r\ndirection, in this part of the country, lie valleys, where we used to\r\ngo in the evenings in search of new walks.\r\n\r\nIn the morning, we breakfasted together; after breakfast, I withdrew to\r\nmy work; Madame de Beaumont had the goodness to copy out the quotations\r\nwhich I marked for her. This noble woman offered me a shelter when I\r\nhad none: without the peace which she gave me, I should perhaps never\r\nhave finished a work which I had been unable to complete during my\r\nmisfortunes.\r\n\r\nI shall evermore remember certain evenings passed in this refuge of\r\nfriendship: on returning from walking we gathered near a fresh-water\r\nbasin, which stood in the middle of a grass-plot in the kitchen-garden.\r\nMadame Joubert, Madame de Beaumont and I sat down on a bench; Madame\r\nJoubert's son rolled on the grass at our feet; that child has already\r\ndisappeared. M. Joubert walked alone on a gravel path; two watch-dogs\r\nand a cat played around us, while pigeons cooed on the edge of the\r\nroof. What happiness for a man newly landed from exile, after spending\r\neight years in profound abandonment, excepting a few days quickly\r\nlapsed! It was generally on these evenings that my friends made me\r\ntalk of my travels: I have never described the desert of the New\r\nWorld so well as at that time. At night, when the windows of our\r\nrustic drawing-room were opened, Madame de Beaumont noted different\r\nconstellations, telling me that I should remember one day that she had\r\ntaught me to know them: since I have lost her, I have several times,\r\nnot far from her grave in Rome, in the midst of the Campagna, looked\r\nin the firmament for the stars whose names she told me: I have seen\r\nthem shining above the Sabine Hills; the protracted rays of those\r\nstars shot down and struck the surface of the Tiber. The spot where I\r\nsaw them over the woods of Savigny, the spots where I have seen them\r\nsince, the fitfulness of my destinies, that sign which a woman had left\r\nfor me in the sky to remind me of her: all this broke my heart. By\r\nwhat miracle does man consent to do what he does upon earth, he who is\r\ndoomed to die?\r\n\r\nOne day, in our retreat, we saw a man enter stealthily by one window\r\nand go out by another: it was M. de Laborie[416]; he was escaping from\r\nBonaparte's claws. Shortly after appeared one of those souls in pain\r\nwhich are of a different species from other souls and which, on their\r\npassage, mingle their unknown misfortune with the vulgar sufferings of\r\nmankind: it was Lucile, my sister.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: I meet my sisters.]\r\n\r\nAfter my arrival in France, I had written to my family to inform them\r\nof my return. Madame la Comtesse de Marigny, my eldest sister, was the\r\nfirst to come to me, went to the wrong street, and met five Messieurs\r\nLassagne, of whom the last climbed up through a cobbler's trap-door to\r\nanswer to his name. Madame de Chateaubriand came in her turn: she was\r\ncharming, and full of the qualities calculated to give me the happiness\r\nwhich I found with her after we came together again. Madame la Comtess\r\nde Caud, Lucile, came next. M. Joubert and Madame de Beaumont became\r\nsmitten with a passionate fondness and a tender pity for her. Then\r\ncommenced between them a correspondence which ended only with the death\r\nof the two women who had bent over towards one another like two flowers\r\nof the same species on the point of fading away. Madame Lucile having\r\nstopped at Versailles on the 30th of September 1802, I received this\r\nnote from her:\r\n\r\n    \"I write to beg you to thank Madame de Beaumont on my behalf\r\n    for the invitation she has sent me to go to Savigny. I hope\r\n    to have that pleasure in about a fortnight, unless there be\r\n    any objection on Madame de Beaumont's side.\"\r\n\r\nMadame de Caud came to Savigny as she had promised.\r\n\r\nI have told you how, in my youth, my sister, a canoness of the Chapter\r\nof the Argentière, and destined for that of Remiremont, cherished an\r\nattachment for M. de Malfilâtre, a counsellor to the Parliament of\r\nBrittany, which, remaining locked within her breast, had increased\r\nher natural melancholy. During the Revolution she married M. le Comte\r\nde Caud, and lost him after fifteen months of marriage. The death of\r\nMadame la Comtesse de Farcy, a sister whom she fondly loved, added\r\nto Madame de Caud's sadness. She next attached herself to Madame de\r\nChateaubriand, my wife, and gained an empire over the latter which\r\nbecame painful, for Lucile was violent, masterful, unreasonable, and\r\nMadame de Chateaubriand, subject to her caprices, hid from her in order\r\nto render her the services which a richer shows to a susceptible and\r\nless happy friend.\r\n\r\nLucile's genius and character had almost reached the pitch of madness\r\nof Jean Jacques Rousseau; she thought herself exposed to secret\r\nenemies: she gave Madame de Beaumont, M. Joubert, myself, false\r\naddresses at which to write to her; she examined the seals, seeking to\r\ndiscover whether they had not been broken; she wandered from one home\r\nto the other, unable to remain either with my sisters or my wife; she\r\nhad taken an antipathy to them, and Madame de Chateaubriand, after\r\nshowing her a devotion surpassing all that one could imagine, had ended\r\nby breaking down under the burden of so cruel an affection.\r\n\r\nAnother fatality had struck Lucile: M. de Chênedollé, then living\r\nnear Vire, had gone to see her at Fougères; soon there was talk of a\r\nmarriage, which fell through. Everything failed my sister at once, and,\r\nthrown back upon herself, she no longer had the strength to bear up.\r\nThis plaintive spectre rested for a moment on a stone, in the smiling\r\nsolitude of Savigny: there were so many hearts there which would have\r\njoyfully received her! They would so gladly have restored her to a\r\nsweet reality of existence! But Lucile's heart could beat only in\r\nan atmosphere made expressly for her and never breathed by others.\r\nShe swiftly devoured the days of the world apart in which Heaven had\r\nplaced her. Why had God created a being only to suffer? What mysterious\r\nrelation can there be between a long-suffering nature and an eternal\r\nprinciple?\r\n\r\nMy sister had not changed in any way; she had only taken the fixed\r\nexpression of her ills: her head had sunk a little, like a head on\r\nwhich the hours had weighed heavily. She reminded me of my parents:\r\nthose first family memories, evoked from the grave, surrounded me like\r\nwraiths which had gathered round at night to warm themselves at the\r\ndying flame of a funeral pile. As I watched her, I seemed to see in\r\nLucile my whole childhood, looking out at me from behind her somewhat\r\nwild eyes.\r\n\r\nThe vision of pain faded away: that woman, borne down by life, seemed\r\nto have come to fetch the other dejected woman whom she was to take\r\nwith her.\r\n\r\n*\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Talma.]\r\n\r\nThe summer passed: according to custom, I promised myself to begin it\r\nagain next year; but the hand of the clock does not return to the hour\r\nwhich we would wish to call back. During the winter, in Paris, I made\r\nsome new acquaintances. M. Jullien, a rich man, obliging, and a jovial\r\ntable-companion, although belonging to a family in which they killed\r\nthemselves, had a box at the Français; he used to lend it to Madame de\r\nBeaumont: I went four or five times to the play with M. de Fontanes\r\nand M. Joubert. When I entered the world, old-fashioned comedy was in\r\nall its glory; I found it again in a state of complete decomposition.\r\nTragedy still kept up, thanks to Mademoiselle Duchesnois[417] and,\r\nabove all, to Talma, who had attained the highest level of dramatic\r\ntalent. I had seen him when he made his first appearances; he was less\r\nhandsome and, so to speak, less young than at the age when I saw him\r\nagain: he had acquired the distinction, the nobility, and the gravity\r\nof years.\r\n\r\nThe portrait of Talma which Madame de Staël has drawn in her work on\r\nGermany is only half true: the brilliant writer saw the great actor\r\nthrough a woman's imagination, and attributed to him what he lacked.\r\n\r\nOf the intermediate world Talma did not know what to make: he did\r\nnot understand the man of gentle birth; he did not know our old-time\r\nsociety; he had not sat at the table of high-born ladies, in the Gothic\r\ntower enshrined in the wood; he knew nothing of the flexibility, the\r\nvariety of expression, the gallantry, the light charm of manner, the\r\ningenuousness, the tenderness, the heroism based upon honour, the\r\nChristian devotion of chivalry: he was not Tancred, or Coucy, or at\r\nleast he turned them into heroes of a middle-age of his own creation;\r\nhis Othello was placed in the heart of Vendôme.\r\n\r\nThen what was Talma? Himself, his century and antiquity. He had the\r\ndeep and concentrated passions of love and of patriotism; they burst\r\nfrom his breast with the force of an explosion. He had the baleful\r\ninspiration, the deranged genius of the Revolution through which he\r\nhad passed. The terrible spectacles with which he was once surrounded\r\nwere renewed in his talent with the lamentable and distant accents\r\nof the choruses of Sophocles and Euripides. His grace, which was not\r\nconventional grace, took hold of you like misfortune. Dark ambition,\r\nremorse, jealousy, melancholy of soul, physical pain, madness produced\r\nby the gods and adversity, human affliction: those were what he knew.\r\nHis mere entrance upon the stage, the mere sound of his voice were\r\nmightily tragic. Suffering and thought were mingled on his brow,\r\nbreathed in his immovability, in his poses, his gestures, his steps.\r\nAs a Greek, he would arrive, panting and ominous, from the ruins\r\nof Argos, an immortal Orestes, tormented for three thousand years\r\nby the Eumenides; as a Frenchman, he would come from the solitudes\r\nof Saint-Denis, where the Parcæ of 1793 had cut the thread of the\r\nsepulchral life of the Kings. The very picture of sorrow awaiting\r\nsomething unknown, but decreed by an unjust Heaven, he went his way,\r\nthe galley-slave of fate, inexorably chained between fatality and\r\nterror.\r\n\r\nTime casts an inevitable obscurity over the older dramatic\r\nmasterpieces: its projected shadow changes the purest Raphaëls into\r\nRembrandts[418]; but for Talma, a part of the marvels of Corneille\r\nand Racine would have remained unknown. Dramatic talent is a torch:\r\nit fires other half-extinguished torches and revives geniuses which\r\nenrapture you with their renewed splendour.\r\n\r\nWe owe to Talma the perfection of the actor's dress. But are stage\r\nrealism and rigour of costume so necessary to art as is supposed?\r\nRacine's characters derive nothing from the cut of their clothes: in\r\nthe pictures of the first painters, the back-grounds are neglected and\r\nthe costumes incorrect. The \"furies\" of Orestes, or the \"prophecies\" of\r\nJoad, read in a drawing-room by Talma in a dress-coat, made as great an\r\nimpression as when declaimed upon the stage by Talma in a Greek mantle\r\nor a Jewish robe. Iphigenia was attired like Madame de Sévigné, when\r\nBoileau addressed those fine verses to his friend:\r\n\r\n    Jamais Iphigénie en Aulide immolée\r\n    N'a coûté tant de pleurs à la Grèce assemblée\r\n    Que, dans l'heureux spectacle à nos yeux étalé,\r\n    N'en a fait sous son nom verser la Champmeslé[419].\r\n\r\nThis correctness in the representation of inanimate objects is the\r\nspirit of the arts of our time: it points to the decadence of lofty\r\npoetry and of the true drama; we are content with lesser beauties, when\r\nwe are impotent to achieve the greater; we imitate armchairs and velvet\r\nto perfection, when we are no longer able to paint the expression of\r\nthe man seated on that velvet and in those armchairs. Nevertheless,\r\nonce one has descended to that truthfulness of material forms, one\r\nfinds one's self obliged to reproduce it; for the public, itself\r\nmaterialized, demands it.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Comments on the _Génie._]\r\n\r\nMeanwhile I was finishing the _Génie du Christianisme_: Lucien asked\r\nto see some of the proofs; I sent them to him; he added some rather\r\ncommon-place notes in the margins.\r\n\r\nAlthough the success of my big book was as brilliant as that of my\r\nlittle _Atala_, it was nevertheless more widely contested: this was a\r\nserious work, in which I no longer fought the principles of the old\r\nliterature and of philosophy with a novel, but attacked them directly\r\nwith arguments and facts. The Voltairean empire uttered a cry and flew\r\nto arms. Madame de Staël was mistaken as to the future of my religious\r\nstudies: they brought her the work uncut; she pushed her fingers\r\nbetween the pages, came upon the chapter headed the _Virginité_, and\r\nsaid to M. Adrien de Montmorency[420], who was with her:\r\n\r\n\"Oh Heavens! Our poor Chateaubriand! That will fall to the ground!\"\r\n\r\nThe Abbé de Boulogne[421], who was shown some portions of my work\r\nbefore it was sent to press, said to the bookseller who asked his\r\nopinion:\r\n\r\n\"If you want to ruin yourself, print that.\"\r\n\r\nAnd the Abbé de Boulogne has since written an all too splendid eulogy\r\nof my book.\r\n\r\nEverything, in fact, seemed to prophesy failure. What hope could I\r\nhave, I with no name and no extollers, of destroying the influence\r\nof Voltaire, which had prevailed for more than half a century,\r\nof Voltaire, who had raised the huge edifice completed by the\r\nEncyclopædists and consolidated by all the famous men in Europe?\r\nWhat! were the Diderots, the d'Alemberts, the Duclos[422], the\r\nDupuis[423], the Helvétius[424], the Condorcets[425] minds that carried\r\nno authority? What! was the world to return, to the Golden Legend, to\r\nrenounce the admiration it had acquired for masterpieces of science and\r\nreason? How could I ever win a case which Rome armed with its thunders,\r\nthe clergy with its might, had been unable to save: a case defended\r\nin vain by the Archbishop of Paris, Christophe de Beaumont[426],\r\nsupported by the decrees of the Parliament and the armed force and\r\nname of the King? Was it not as ridiculous as it was rash on the part\r\nof an unknown man to set himself against a philosophical movement so\r\nirresistible as to have produced the Revolution? It was curious to see\r\na pygmy \"toughen his little arms\" to stifle the progress of a century,\r\nstop civilization, and thrust back the human race! Thank God, a word\r\nwould be enough to pulverize the madman: wherefore M. Ginguené, when\r\ntrouncing the _Génie du Christianisme_ in the _Décade_[427] declared\r\nthat the criticism came too late, since my tautologous production\r\nwas already forgotten. He said this five or six months after the\r\npublication of a work which the attack of the whole French Academy, on\r\nthe occasion of the decennial prizes, was not able to kill.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: I publish my chief work.]\r\n\r\nIt was amid the ruins of our temples that I published the _Génie du\r\nChristianisme._[428] The faithful thought themselves saved: men at that\r\ntime felt a need of faith, a thirsting for religious consolations,\r\nwhich arose from the want of those consolations experienced since\r\nlong years. What supernatural strength was required to bear all the\r\nadversities undergone! How many mutilated families had to go to the\r\nFather of mankind in search of the children they had lost! How many\r\nbroken hearts, how many solitary souls, were calling for a divine\r\nhand to cure them! One threw one's self into the house of God, as one\r\nenters a doctor's house on the outbreak of an infection. The victims\r\nof our disturbances (and how many different kinds of victims!) saved\r\nthemselves at the altar: shipwrecked men clinging to the rock on which\r\nthey seek for salvation.\r\n\r\nBonaparte, at that time hoping to found his power on the first basis\r\nof society, had just made arrangements with the Court of Rome: he at\r\nfirst raised no obstacle against the publication of a work calculated\r\nto enhance the popularity of his schemes; he had to struggle against\r\nthe men about him and against the declared enemies of religion; he was\r\nglad therefore to be defended from the outside by the opinion called up\r\nby the _Génie du Christianisme._ Later, he repented him of his mistake;\r\nideas of regular monarchy had sprung into being together with ideas of\r\nreligion.\r\n\r\nAn episode in the _Génie du Christianisme_, which at the time caused\r\nless stir than _Atala_, fixed one of the characters of modern\r\nliterature; but I may say that, if _René_ did not exist, I should not\r\nnow write it: if it were possible for me to destroy it, I would do so.\r\nA family of Renés, poets and prose-writers, has swarmed into being:\r\nwe have heard nothing but mournful and desultory phrases; it has been\r\na question of nothing but winds and storms, of unknown words directed\r\nto the clouds and the night. No scribbler fresh from college but has\r\nimagined himself the unhappiest of men; no babe of sixteen but has\r\nbelieved himself to have exhausted life and to be tormented by his\r\ngenius, but has, in the abyss of his thoughts, abandoned himself to\r\nthe \"wave of his passions,\" struck his pale and dishevelled brow, and\r\nastonished stupefied mankind with a misfortune of which he did not know\r\nthe name, nor they either.\r\n\r\nIn _René_ I had laid bare one of the infirmities of my century; but\r\nit was a different madness in the novelists to try to make universal\r\nsuch transcendental afflictions. The general sentiments which compose\r\nthe basis of humanity, paternal and maternal affection, filial\r\npiety, friendship, love, are inexhaustible; but particular ways of\r\nfeeling, idiosyncrasies of mind and character, cannot be spread out\r\nand multiplied over wide and numerous scenes. The small undiscovered\r\ncorners of the human heart are a narrow field; there is nothing left to\r\ngather in that field after the hand which has been the first to mow it.\r\nA malady of the soul is not a permanent nor natural state: one cannot\r\nreproduce it, make a literature of it, make use of it as of a general\r\npassion constantly modified at the will of the artists who handle it\r\nand change its form.\r\n\r\nBe that as it may, literature became tinged with the colours of\r\nmy religious paintings, even as public affairs have retained the\r\nphraseology of my writings on citizenship: the _Monarchy according to\r\nthe Charter_ has been the rudiment of our representative government,\r\nand my article in the _Conservateur_, on \"Moral Interests and Material\r\nInterests,\" has bequeathed those two designations to politics.\r\n\r\nWriters did me the honour of imitating _Atala_ and _René_, in the\r\nsame way that the pulpit borrowed my accounts of the missions and\r\nadvantages of Christianity. The passages in which I show that, by\r\ndriving the pagan divinities from the woods, our broader religion has\r\nrestored nature to its solitudes; the paragraphs where I discuss the\r\ninfluence of our religion upon our manner of seeing a painting, where\r\nI examine the changes wrought in poetry and eloquence; the chapters\r\nwhich I devote to inquiries into the foreign sentiments introduced\r\ninto the dramatic characters of antiquity contain the germ of the new\r\ncriticism. Racine's characters, as I have said, both are and are not\r\nGreek characters: they are Christian characters; that is what no one\r\nhad understood.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Effects of the publication.]\r\n\r\nIf the effect of the _Génie du Christianisme_ had been only a\r\nreaction against doctrines to which the revolutionary misfortunes\r\nwere attributed, that effect would have ceased so soon as the cause\r\nwas removed; it would not have been prolonged to the time at which\r\nI am writing. But the action of the _Génie du Christianisme_ upon\r\npublic opinion was not confined to the momentary resurrection of a\r\nreligion supposed to be in its grave: a more lasting metamorphosis was\r\noperated. If the work contained innovations of style, it also contained\r\nchanges of doctrine; not only the manner, but the matter, was altered;\r\natheism and materialism were no longer the basis of the belief or\r\nunbelief of young minds; the idea of God and of the immortality of\r\nthe soul resumed its empire: whence came an alteration in the chain\r\nof ideas linked one to the other. A man was no longer riveted to his\r\nplace by an anti-religious prejudice; he no longer thought himself\r\nobliged to remain a mummy of annihilation, wrapped in philosophical\r\nswathing-bands; he permitted himself to examine any system, however\r\nabsurd it might seem to him, _even though it were Christian._\r\n\r\nBesides the faithful who returned at the sound of their shepherd's\r\nvoice, there were formed, by this right of free examination, other\r\n_à priori_ faithful. Lay down God as a principle, and the Word will\r\nfollow. The Son proceeds necessarily from the Father.\r\n\r\nThe various abstract combinations succeed only in substituting for\r\nthe Christian mysteries other mysteries still more difficult of\r\ncomprehension. Pantheism, which, besides, exists in three or four\r\nshapes, and which it is the fashion nowadays to ascribe to enlightened\r\nintelligences, is the absurdest of Eastern dreams brought back to\r\nlight by Spinoza[429]. One has but to read the article by the sceptic\r\nBayle[430] on that Jew of Amsterdam. The positive tone in which\r\ncertain people speak of all these things would be revolting, were\r\nit not that it arises from want of study; they take up words which\r\nthey do not understand, and imagine themselves to be transcendental\r\ngeniuses. Be assured that Abélard, that St. Bernard, that St.\r\nThomas Aquinas and their fellows brought to bear upon the study of\r\nmetaphysics a superiority of judgment which we do not approach;\r\nthat the Saint-Simonian[431], Phalansterian, Fourieristic[432],\r\nHumanitarian[433] systems were discovered and practised by the\r\ndifferent heresies; that what is placed before us as progress and\r\ndiscovery is so much old lumber hawked about for fifteen centuries\r\nin the schools of Greece and the colleges of the Middle Ages.\r\nThe misfortune is that the first sectaries could not succeed in\r\nfounding their Neo-Platonic Republic, when Gallienus[434] permitted\r\nPlotinus[435] to make the experiment in Campania; later, people made\r\nthe great mistake of burning the sectaries when they proposed to\r\nestablish the community of goods and to pronounce prostitution holy, by\r\nurging that a woman cannot, without sin, refuse a man who asks of her a\r\ntransient union in the name of Jesus Christ: all that was needed, said\r\nthey, to accomplish this union was to annihilate one's soul and deposit\r\nit for a moment in the bosom of God.\r\n\r\nThe shock which the _Génie du Christianisme_ gave to men's minds caused\r\nthe eighteenth century to emerge from the old road and flung it for\r\never out of its path. People began again, or rather they began for the\r\nfirst time to study the sources of Christianity; on re-reading the\r\nFathers (presuming that they had read them before) they were struck at\r\nmeeting with so many curious facts, so much philosophical science, so\r\nmany beauties of style of every kind, so many ideas which, by a more\r\nor less perceptible gradation, produced the transition from ancient\r\nto modern society: an unique and memorable era of humanity, in which\r\nHeaven communicates with earth through the medium of souls set in men\r\nof genius.\r\n\r\nBeside the crumbling world of paganism there arose, in former times,\r\nas though outside society, another world, looking on at those great\r\nspectacles, poor, retiring, secluded, taking no part in the business\r\nof life except when its lessons or its succour were needed. It was a\r\nmarvellous thing to see those early bishops, almost all honoured with\r\nthe name of saints and martyrs, those simple priests watching over the\r\nrelics and cemeteries; those monks and hermits in their convents or\r\nin their caves, laying down laws of peace, morals, charity, when all\r\nwas war, corruption, barbarism; going between the tyrants of Rome and\r\nthe leaders of the Tartars and Goths, to prevent the injustice of the\r\nformer and the cruelty of the latter; stopping armies with a wooden\r\ncross and a peaceful word; the weakest of men, and protecting the world\r\nagainst Attila[436]; placed between two universes to be the link that\r\njoined them, to console the last moments of an expiring society and\r\nsupport the first steps of a society in its cradle.\r\n\r\n*\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: My own criticism.]\r\n\r\nIt was impossible but that the truths unfolded in the _Génie du\r\nChristianisme_ should contribute to a change of ideas. Again, it is to\r\nthis work that the present love for the buildings of the Middle Ages\r\nis due: it is I who have called upon the young century to admire the\r\nold temples. If my opinion has been misused; if it is not true that\r\nour cathedrals approach the Parthenon in beauty; if it is false that\r\nthose churches teach us unknown facts in their documents of stone; if\r\nit is madness to maintain that those granite memories reveal to us\r\nthings that escaped the learned Benedictines; if by dint of eternally\r\nrepeating the word Gothic people grow wearied to death of it: that\r\nis not my fault. For the rest, with respect to the arts, I know the\r\nshortcomings of the _Génie du Christianisme_; that portion of my work\r\nis faulty, because, in 1800, I was not acquainted with the arts:\r\nI had not seen Italy, nor Greece, nor Egypt. Also, I did not make\r\nsufficient use of the lives of the saints and of the legends, although\r\nthey offered me a number of marvellous instances: by selecting with\r\ntaste, one could there reap a plentiful harvest. This field of the\r\nwealth of mediæval imagination surpasses the _Metamorphoses_ of Ovid\r\nand the Milesian fables in fruitfulness. My work, moreover, contains\r\nsome scanty or false judgments, such as that which I pronounce upon\r\nDante, to whom I have since paid a brilliant tribute. In the serious\r\nrespect, I have completed the _Génie du Christianisme_ in my _Études\r\nhistoriques_, one of my writings that has been least spoken of and most\r\nplundered.\r\n\r\nThe success of _Atala_ had delighted me, because my soul was still\r\nfresh; that of the _Génie du Christianisme_ was painful to me: I was\r\nobliged to sacrifice my time to a more or less useless correspondence\r\nand to irrelevant civilities. A so-called admiration did not atone to\r\nme for the vexations that await a man whose name the crowd remembers.\r\nWhat good can supply the place of the peace which you have lost by\r\nadmitting the public to your intimacy? Add to that the restlessness\r\nwith which the Muses love to afflict those who attach themselves\r\nto their cult, the worries attendant upon a compliant character,\r\ninaptitude for fortune, loss of leisure, an uncertain temper, livelier\r\naffections, unreasonable melancholy, groundless joys: who, if he had\r\nthe choice, would purchase on those conditions the uncertain advantages\r\nof a reputation which you are not sure of obtaining, which will be\r\ncontested during your life, which posterity will refuse to confirm, and\r\nwhich your death will snatch from you for ever?\r\n\r\nThe literary controversy on innovations of style which _Atala_\r\nhad aroused was renewed upon the publication of the _Génie du\r\nChristianisme._\r\n\r\nA characteristic feature of the imperial school, and even of the\r\nrepublican school, must be noted: while society advanced for better or\r\nfor worse, literature remained stationary; foreign to the change of\r\nthe ideas, it did not belong to its own time. In comedy, the squires\r\nof the village, the Colins, the Babets, or else the intrigues of the\r\ndrawing-rooms, which were no longer known, were played, as I have\r\nalready remarked, before coarse and blood-thirsty men, themselves the\r\ndestroyers of the manners whose picture was presented to them; in\r\ntragedy, a plebeian pit interested itself in the families of nobles and\r\nkings.\r\n\r\nTwo things kept literature at the date of the eighteenth century: the\r\nimpiety which it derived from Voltaire and the Revolution, and the\r\ndespotism with which Bonaparte struck it. The head of the State found a\r\nprofit in those subordinate letters which he had put in barracks, which\r\npresented arms to him, which sallied forth at the command of \"Turn\r\nout, the guard!\" which marched in rank, and which went through their\r\nevolutions like soldiers. Any form of independence seemed a rebellion\r\nagainst his power; he would no more consent to a riot of words and\r\nideas than he suffered insurrection. He suspended the Habeas Corpus for\r\nthought as well as for individual liberty. Let us also recognise that\r\nthe public, weary of anarchy, was glad to submit again to the yoke of\r\nlaw and order.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: New forms in literature.]\r\n\r\nThe literature which expresses the new era did not commence to reign\r\nuntil forty or fifty years after the time of which it was the idiom.\r\nDuring that half-century, it was employed only by the opposition.\r\nIt was Madame de Staël, it was Benjamin Constant[437], it was\r\nLemercier[438], it was Bonald, it was myself, in short, who were the\r\nfirst to speak that language. The alteration in literature of which\r\nthe nineteenth century boasts came to it from the Emigration and from\r\nexile: it was M. de Fontanes who brooded on those birds of a different\r\nspecies from himself, because, by going back to the seventeenth\r\ncentury, he had gained the strength of that fertile period and lost the\r\nbarrenness of the eighteenth. One portion of the human intelligence,\r\nthat which treats of transcendental matters, alone advanced with an\r\neven step with civilisation; unfortunately, the glory of knowledge\r\nwas not without stain: the Laplaces[439], the Lagranges[440], the\r\nMonges[441], the Chaptals[442], the Berthollets[443], all the\r\nprodigies, once haughty democrats, became Napoleon's most obsequious\r\nservants. Let it be said to the honour of Letters: the new literature\r\nwas free, science was servile; character did not correspond with\r\ngenius, and they whose thought had sped to the uppermost sky were not\r\nable to raise their souls above the feet of Bonaparte: they pretended\r\nto have no need of God, that was why they needed a tyrant.\r\n\r\nThe Napoleonic classic was the genius of the nineteenth century dressed\r\nup in the periwig of Louis XIV., or curled as in the days of Louis\r\nXV. Bonaparte had ordained that the men of the Revolution should not\r\nappear at Court save in full dress, sword at side. One saw nothing\r\nof the France of the moment; it was not order, it was discipline.\r\nNor could anything be more tiresome than that pale resuscitation of\r\nthe literature of former days. That cold copy, that unproductive\r\nanachronism, disappeared when the new literature broke in noisily with\r\nthe _Génie du Christianisme._ The death of the Duc d'Enghien had for\r\nme this advantage that, by causing me to step aside, it left me free\r\nin my solitude to follow my own inspiration, and prevented me from\r\nenlisting in the regular infantry of old Pindus: I owed my moral to my\r\nintellectual liberty.\r\n\r\nIn the last chapter of the _Génie du Christianisme_, I discuss what\r\nwould have become of the world if the Faith had not been preached at\r\nthe time of the invasion of the Barbarians; in another paragraph,\r\nI speak of an important work to be undertaken on the changes\r\nwhich Christianity introduced in the laws after the conversion of\r\nConstantine[444].\r\n\r\nSupposing religious opinion to exist in its present form, if the _Génie\r\ndu Christianisme_ were yet to be written, I would compose it quite\r\ndifferently: instead of recalling the benefits and the institutions\r\nof our religion in the past, I would show that Christianity is the\r\nthought of the future and of human liberty; that that redeeming and\r\nMessianic thought is the only basis of social equality; that it alone\r\ncan establish the latter, because it places by the side of that\r\nequality the necessity of duty, the corrective and regulator of the\r\ndemocratic instinct. Legality is no sufficient restraint, because\r\nit is not permanent; it derives its strength from the law: now, the\r\nlaw is the work of men who pass away and differ. A law is not always\r\nobligatory; it can always be changed by another law: as opposed to\r\nthat, morals are constant; they have their force within themselves,\r\nbecause they spring from the immutable order: they alone, therefore,\r\ncan ensure permanency.\r\n\r\nI would show that, wherever Christianity has prevailed, it has changed\r\nideas, rectified notions of justice and injustice, substituted\r\nassertion for doubt, embraced the whole of humanity in its doctrines\r\nand precepts. I would try to conjecture the distance at which we still\r\nare from the total accomplishment of the Gospel, by calculating the\r\nnumber of evils that have been destroyed and of improvements that have\r\nbeen effected in the eighteen centuries which have elapsed on this side\r\nof the Cross. Christianity acts slowly, because it acts everywhere; it\r\ndoes not cling to the reform of any particular society, it works upon\r\nsociety in general; its philanthropy is extended to all the sons of\r\nAdam: that is what it expresses with a marvellous simplicity in its\r\ncommonest petitions, in its daily prayers, when it says to the crowd in\r\nthe temple:\r\n\r\n\"Let us pray for every suffering thing upon earth.\"\r\n\r\nWhat religion has ever spoken in this way? The Word was not made flesh\r\nin the man of pleasure, it became incarnate in the man of sorrow, with\r\na view to the enfranchisement of all, to an universal brotherhood and\r\nan infinite salvation.\r\n\r\nIf the _Génie du Christianisme_ had only given rise to such\r\ninvestigations, I should congratulate myself on having published it.\r\nIt remains to be seen whether, at the time of the appearance of the\r\nbook, a different _Génie du Christianisme_, raised on the new plan the\r\noutline of which I have barely indicated, would have obtained the same\r\nsuccess. In 1803, when nothing was granted to the old religion, when it\r\nwas the object of scorn, when none knew the first word of the question,\r\nwould one have done well to speak of future liberty as descending from\r\nCalvary, at a time when people were still bruised from the excesses of\r\nthe liberty of the passions? Would Bonaparte have suffered such a work\r\nto appear? It was perhaps useful to stimulate regrets, to interest the\r\nimagination in a cause so misjudged, to call attention to the despised\r\nobject, to render it endearing before showing how serious it was, how\r\nmighty and how salutary.\r\n\r\nNow, supposing that my name leaves some trace behind it, I shall owe\r\nthis to the _Génie du Christianisme_: with no illusion as to the\r\nintrinsic value of the work, I admit that it possesses an accidental\r\nvalue; it came just at the right moment. For this reason it caused me\r\nto take my place in one of those historic periods which, mixing an\r\nindividual with things, compel him to be remembered. If the influence\r\nof my work was not limited to the change which, in the past forty\r\nyears, it has produced among the living generations; if it still served\r\nto resuscitate among late-comers a spark of the civilizing truths of\r\nthe earth; if the slight symptom of life which one seems to perceive\r\nwas there sustained in the generations to come, I should depart full of\r\nhope in the divine mercy. O reconciled Christian, do not forget me in\r\nthy prayers, when I am gone; my faults, perhaps, will stop me outside\r\nthose gates where my charity cried on thy behalf:\r\n\r\n\"Be ye lifted up, O eternal gates[445]!\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[361] This book was begun at Dieppe in 1836 and finished in Paris in\r\n1837. It was revised in December 1846.--T.\r\n\r\n[362] Anne Geneviève de Bourbon-Condé, Duchesse de Longueville\r\n(1619-1679), sister of the great Condé, had intrigued against the\r\nCourt, and played a great part in the war of the Fronde (1648-1652).\r\nThe escape took place in 1650.

He was born a\r\nProtestant, was converted by Bossuet, but abjured the Catholic Faith in\r\n1678.--T.\r\n\r\n[365] François Duc de La Rochefoucauld (1605 or 1613-1680). He played\r\na small part in the Fronde through his infatuation for Madame de\r\nLongueville.

He\r\nwas twice married to ladies of middle-class family (_vide infra_), by\r\nwhom he had eleven children.--T.\r\n\r\n[393] François Joachim Cardinal de Pierres de Bernis (1715-1794),\r\nAnacreontic poet and religious controversialist. He had been Madame de\r\nPompadour's lover, and owed his advancement to her. Voltaire called him\r\nBabet la Bouquetière, owing to the profusion of flowers of rhetoric\r\nwhich he employed in his verses.--T.\r\n\r\n[394] Madame Lucien Bonaparte (_d._ 1800), _née_ Christine Éléonore\r\nBoyer, married Lucien in 1794, and was the sister of the woman who kept\r\nthe inn at Saint-Maximin, where Lucien, then under age, was staying.\r\nThe marriage took place without the consent of Madame Bonaparte, the\r\nmother, and was invalid by French law.

On the next day\r\nhis cousin, Louis Victor Hippolyte Luce de Montmorin, had his throat\r\ncut at the Conciergerie, where he had been taken after his acquittal\r\nby the Criminal Tribunal on the 17th of August. Madame de Montmorin,\r\nMadame de Beaumont's mother, was guillotined on the 10th of May 1794;\r\nher second son was guillotined with her. Her daughter, wife of the\r\nComte de La Luzerne, died on the 10th of July 1794, at the Archbishop's\r\nPalace, which had been turned into the prison hospital.--B.\r\n\r\n[399] Madame Élisabeth Vigée-Lebrun (1756-1842), _née_ Vigée, the\r\nfamous French portrait painter. She left nearly 700 portraits, in\r\naddition to some historical pictures and a crowd of landscapes.--T.\r\n\r\n[400] Matthieu Louis Molé (1781-1855), created a Count of the Empire\r\nin 1813, when he became Minister of Justice, and held successive\r\nministries under the Restoration and Louis-Philippe. He was a moderate\r\nstatesman of much dignity of character and of great distinction of\r\nperson, manners, and speech. He was elected a member of the French\r\nAcademy in 1840.--T.\r\n\r\n[401] Étienne Duc Pasquier (1767-1862), appointed Prefect of Police in\r\n1810. After holding various ministerial offices under the Restoration,\r\nhe was made President of the Chamber of Peers by Louis-Philippe in\r\n1830, Chancellor in 1837, and a duke in 1844. Elected to the French\r\nAcademy in 1842.--T.\r\n\r\n[402] Louise Marie Victorine Comtesse de Chastenay-Lanty (1771-1855)\r\nwas never married. Her title of madame is due to the fact that\r\nshe became a canoness at an early age (1785). Her observation to\r\nChateaubriand on the subject of Joubert will be found repeated\r\nin almost precisely the same words in Madame de Chastenay's\r\nrecently-published Memoirs (1896), vol. II. p. 82.--T.\r\n\r\n[403] Louis Bénoît Picard (1769-1828), an actor, theatrical manager,\r\nand author of some eighty stage-plays of varying merit. He was received\r\ninto the French Academy in 1807.--T.\r\n\r\n[404] In the \"small company\" which, at the beginning of the\r\ncentury, met in the drawing-room of Madame de Beaumont, in the Rue\r\nNeuve-du-Luxembourg, or at Chateaubriand's, in his little apartment in\r\nthe Hôtel Coislin, on the Place Louis XV., or again, in the summer,\r\nat Villeneuve-sur-Yonne, under M. Joubert's roof, each one, according\r\nto an ancient fashion, had his nickname. Chateaubriand was called _le\r\nchat_, the \"Cat,\" by way of abbreviation of his name, or possibly\r\nbecause of his illegible handwriting; Madame de Chateaubriand, who\r\nhad claws, was the \"She-cat.\" Chênedollé and Gueneau de Mussy, more\r\nmelancholy than René, had received the names of the \"Big\" and the\r\n\"Little Crow;\" sometimes also Chateaubriand was called the \"Illustrious\r\nCrow of the Cordilleras,\" by allusion to his travels in America.\r\nFontanes was thickset, and had something athletic in his short stature.\r\nHis friends jestingly compared him to the boar of Erymanthus, and\r\ncalled him the \"Boar.\" Thin and slender, skimming over the earth which\r\nshe was soon to leave, Madame de Beaumont had received the nickname\r\nof the \"Swallow.\" Joubert, a lover of the woods, and at that time a\r\ngreat walker, was the \"Stag;\" while his wife, who was goodness and\r\nwit personified, but of a somewhat fierce humour, laughed when she\r\nwas called the \"She-wolf.\" Never was so intellectual a collection of\r\n\"animals\" seen before.--B.\r\n\r\n[405] Madame Hocquart was a lady possessed of many charms of beauty and\r\nmind.

I had a crowd of acquaintances outside my customary circle. I\r\nwas invited to the country-houses which were being restored. One did as\r\nbest he could in those half-unfurnished, half-furnished manor-houses,\r\nin which old arm-chairs and new stood side by side. Nevertheless, some\r\nof these manor-houses had remained intact, such as the Marais[447],\r\nwhich had come into the possession of Madame de La Briche[448], an\r\nexcellent woman, whom happiness could never succeed in shaking off. I\r\nremember that my immortality went to the Rue Saint-Dominique d'Enfer\r\nto take a seat for the Marais in a wretched hired coach, where I met\r\nMadame de Vintimille and Madame de Fezensac[449]. At Champlâtreux[450]\r\nM. Molé was having some small rooms on the second floor rebuilt.\r\nHis father[451], who had been killed in the revolutionary style, was\r\nreplaced, in a dilapidated drawing-room, by a picture in which Matthieu\r\nMolé was represented stopping a riot with his square cap: a picture\r\nwhich brought home the difference in the times. A splendid intersection\r\nof roads lined with lime-trees had been cut down; but one of the\r\navenues still remained in all the magnificence of its old shade; new\r\nplantations have since been mixed with it: this is the age of poplars.\r\n\r\nOn returning from the Emigration, there was no exile so poor but\r\nlaid out the winding walks of an English garden in the ten feet of\r\nland or court-yard which he had recovered: did I myself, in days\r\npast, not plant the Vallée-aux-Loups? Was it not there that I began\r\nthese Memoirs? Did I not continue them in Montboissier Park, whose\r\nappearance, disfigured by neglect, its owners were then trying to\r\nrevive? Did I not lengthen them in the park at Maintenon[452], quite\r\nrecently restored, a new prey for the returning democracy? The castles\r\nburnt in 1789 ought to have warned what remained of the castles to\r\nremain hidden in their ruins: but the steeples of engulfed villages\r\nwhich pierce through the lava of Vesuvius do not prevent new steeples\r\nand new hamlets from being planted on the surface of that same lava.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The Marquise de Custine.]\r\n\r\nAmong the bees adjusting their hive was the Marquise de Custine[453],\r\nthe heiress of the long tresses of Margaret of Provence[454], wife of\r\nSt. Louis, whose blood flowed in her veins. I was present when she took\r\npossession of Fervacques[455], and I had the honour of sleeping in the\r\nbed of the Bearnese, as I had of sleeping in Queen Christina's[456]\r\nbed at Combourg. The journey was no trifling matter: we had to take\r\non board the carriage Astolphe de Custine[457], then a child, M.\r\nBerstoecher, his tutor, an old Alsatian nurse, who spoke only German,\r\nJenny, the lady's maid, and Trim, a famous dog which ate up the\r\nprovisions for the journey. Would one not have thought that this colony\r\nwas going to Fervacques for good? And yet the furnishing of the house\r\nwas not quite finished when the signal for removal was given. I saw her\r\nwho faced the scaffold with such great courage[458], I saw her, whiter\r\nthan one of the Fates, dressed in black, her figure made thin by death,\r\nher head adorned only with her silken tresses; I saw her smile to me\r\nwith her pale lips and her beautiful teeth when she left Sécherons,\r\nnear Geneva, to breathe her last at Bex, at the entrance to the Valais;\r\nI heard her coffin pass at night along the deserted streets of Lausanne\r\nto take up its eternal place at Fervacques: she was hastening to hide\r\nherself in a property which she had possessed for but a moment, like\r\nher life. I had read on the corner of a chimney-piece in the _château_\r\nthose bad rhymes attributed to the lover of Gabrielle:\r\n\r\n    La dame de Fervacques\r\n    Mérite de vives attacques[459].\r\n\r\nThe soldier-king had said as much to many others: passing declarations\r\nof men, soon effaced and descending from beauty to beauty down to\r\nMadame de Custine. Fervacques has been sold.\r\n\r\nI also met the Duchesse de Châtillon[460], who adorned my valley\r\nat Aulnay during my absence in the Hundred Days. Mrs. Lindsay,\r\nwhom I continued to see, introduced me to Julie Talma[461]. Madame\r\nde Clermont-Tonnerre invited me. We had a common grandmother, and\r\nshe was good enough to call me cousin. The widow of the Comte de\r\nClermont-Tonnerre[462], she was married again, later, to the Marquis\r\nde Talaru[463]. She had converted M. de La Harpe in prison. It was\r\nthrough her that I knew Neveu, the painter, who was enrolled among the\r\nnumber of her _cicisbei_: Neveu brought me into momentary connection\r\nwith Saint-Martin[464].\r\n\r\nM. de Saint-Martin thought he had discovered in _Atala_ a certain\r\ncant which was far from my thoughts, but which to his mind proved an\r\naffinity of doctrine between us. Neveu, in order to bring two brothers\r\ntogether, asked us to dinner in a top room which he occupied in the\r\nout-houses of the Palais-Bourbon. I reached the trysting-place at six\r\no'clock; the heavenly philosopher was at his post. At seven o'clock, a\r\ndiscreet man-servant placed a tureen of soup upon the table, withdrew,\r\nand closed the door. We sat down and began to eat in silence. M. de\r\nSaint-Martin, who, for the rest, had a very fine manner, pronounced\r\nonly a few oracular phrases. Neveu replied with exclamations, uttered\r\nwith a painter's attitudes and grimaces. I said not a word.\r\n\r\nAfter half an hour, the necromancer returned, removed the soup, and\r\nplaced another dish on the table. The courses succeeded each other\r\nin this way, one by one, and at long intervals. M. de Saint-Martin,\r\nbecoming gradually more excited, began to talk after the manner of\r\nan archangel; the more he talked, the more obscure did his language\r\nbecome. Neveu had hinted to me, squeezing my hand, that we should see\r\nextraordinary things, that we should hear sounds. For six mortal hours\r\nI listened and discovered nothing. At midnight, the man of visions\r\nsuddenly rose to his feet. I thought that the spirit of darkness or the\r\nheavenly spirit was descending, that the bells were about to ring out\r\nthrough the mysterious passages; but M. de Saint-Martin declared that\r\nhe was exhausted, and that we would resume the conversation another\r\ntime: he put on his hat and went away. Unhappily for himself, he was\r\nstopped at the door and obliged to come back by an unexpected visit:\r\nnevertheless he was not long in disappearing. I never saw him again: he\r\nwent off to die in the garden of M. Lenoir-Laroche[465], my neighbour\r\nat Aulnay.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Swedenborgian nonsense.]\r\n\r\nI am a refractory subject for Swedenborgianism; the Abbé Faria[466], at\r\na dinner at Madame de Custine's, boasted of being able to kill a canary\r\nby magnetizing it; the canary was the stronger of the two, and the\r\nabbé, beside himself, was obliged to leave the party for fear of being\r\nkilled by the canary. The sole presence of myself, the Christian, had\r\nrendered the tripod powerless.\r\n\r\nAnother time, the celebrated Gall[467], again at Madame de Custine's,\r\ndined next to me, without knowing me, mistook my facial angle,\r\ntook me for a frog, and tried, when he knew who I was, to patch up\r\nhis science in a way which made me blush for him. The shape of the\r\nhead can assist one in distinguishing the sex in individuals, in\r\nindicating what belongs to the beast, to the animal passions; as to\r\nthe intellectual faculties, phrenology will never know them. If one\r\ncould collect the different skulls of the great men who have died since\r\nthe commencement of the world, and were to place them before the eyes\r\nof the phrenologists without telling them to whom they belonged, they\r\nwould not forward one brain to its right address: the examination of\r\nthe \"bumps\" would produce the most comical mistakes.\r\n\r\nI feel conscience-smitten: I spoke of M. de Saint-Martin a trifle\r\nscoffingly; I am sorry for it. That love of scoffing, which I am\r\nconstantly thrusting back and which incessantly returns to me, is a\r\ncause of suffering to me; for I hate the satirical spirit as being the\r\npettiest, commonest, and easiest of all: of course, I am bringing no\r\ncharge against high comedy. M. de Saint-Martin was, when all is said\r\nand done, a man of great merit, of noble and independent character. His\r\nideas, when they were explicable, were lofty and of a superior nature.\r\nOught I not to sacrifice the two foregoing pages to the generous and\r\nmuch too flattering declaration of the author of the _Portrait de M.\r\nde Saint-Martin fait par lui-même[468]?_ I should not hesitate to\r\nsuppress them, if what I say were able to do the smallest hurt to\r\nthe serious reputation of M. de Saint-Martin and to the esteem which\r\nwill always cling to his memory. I am glad, for the rest, to see that\r\nmy recollection has not deceived me: M. de Saint-Martin may not have\r\nreceived quite the same impressions as myself at the dinner of which I\r\nspeak; but you will see that I have not invented the scene, and that M.\r\nde Saint-Martin's account resembles mine at bottom:\r\n\r\n    \"On the 27th of January 1803,\" he says, \"I had an interview\r\n    with M. de Chateaubriand at a dinner arranged for the purpose\r\n    at M. Neveu's, in the Polytechnic School[469]. It would have\r\n    been a great advantage to me to have known him earlier: he\r\n    is the only irreproachable man of letters with whom I have\r\n    come into contact in my existence, and even then I enjoyed\r\n    his conversation only during the meal. For, immediately\r\n    afterwards, there came a visit which made him dumb for the\r\n    rest of the evening, and I do not know when the occasion will\r\n    return, because the king of this world takes great care to\r\n    put a spoke in the wheel of my cart. For the rest, of whom do\r\n    I stand in need except God?\"\r\n\r\nM. de Saint-Martin is worth a thousand of me: the dignity of his last\r\nsentence crushes my harmless banter with all the weight of a serious\r\nnature.\r\n\r\nI had seen M. de Saint-Lambert[470] and Madame de Houdetot[471] at the\r\nMarais. Both represented the opinions and the freedom of days gone\r\nby, carefully packed up and preserved: it was the eighteenth century\r\ndying and married after its own fashion. One need but hold on to life\r\nfor unlawfulness to become lawful. Men feel an infinite esteem for\r\nimmorality because it has not ceased to exist and because time has\r\nadorned it with wrinkles. In truth, a virtuous husband and wife, who\r\nare not husband and wife, but who remain together out of consideration\r\nfor their fellow-creatures, suffer a little from their venerable\r\ncondition; they bore and detest each other cordially with all the\r\nill-humour of old age; that is God's justice:\r\n\r\n    Malheur à qui le ciel accorde de longs jours[472]!\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Madame de Houdetot.]\r\n\r\nIt became difficult to understand certain pages of the _Confessions_\r\nwhen one had seen the object of Rousseau's transports. Had Madame de\r\nHoudetot kept the letters which Jean Jacques wrote to her, and which he\r\nsays were more brilliant than those in the _Nouvelle Héloïse?_ It is\r\nbelieved that she made a sacrifice of them to Saint-Lambert.\r\n\r\nWhen nearly eighty years of age, Madame de Houdetot still cried in\r\nagreeable verses:\r\n\r\n           Et l'amour me console!\r\n    Rien ne pourra me consoler de lui[473].\r\n\r\nShe never went to bed without striking the floor three times with her\r\nslipper and saying, \"Good-night, dear!\" to the late author of the\r\n_Saisons._ That was what the philosophy of the eighteenth century\r\namounted to in 1803.\r\n\r\nThe society of Madame de Houdetot, Diderot, Saint-Lambert, Rousseau,\r\nGrimm[474], and Madame d'Épinay rendered the Valley of Montmorency\r\ninsupportable to me, and though, with regard to facts, I am very glad\r\nthat a relic of the Voltairean times should have come under my notice,\r\nI do not regret those times. I have lately again seen the house in\r\nwhich Madame de Houdetot used to live at Sannois; it is now a mere\r\nempty shell, reduced to the four walls. A deserted hearth is always\r\ninteresting; but what can we gather from hearth-stones by whose side\r\nbeauty has never sat, nor the mother of a family, nor religion, and\r\nwhose ashes, if they were not dispersed, would carry back the memory\r\nonly to days which were capable of nought save destruction?\r\n\r\n*\r\n\r\nA piracy of the _Génie du Christianisme_ at Avignon took me to the\r\nsouth of France in the month of October 1802. I knew only my poor\r\nBrittany and the northern provinces through which I had passed when\r\nleaving my country. I was about to see the sun of Provence, the sky\r\nwhich was to give me a fore-taste of Italy and Greece, towards\r\nwhich my instinct and my muse alike urged me. I was in a happy mood;\r\nmy reputation made life seem light to me: there are many dreams\r\nin the first intoxication of fame, and one's eyes at first become\r\nrapturously filled with the rising light; but should that light become\r\nextinguished, it leaves you in the dark: if it last, the habit of\r\nseeing it soon renders you unmindful of it.\r\n\r\nLyons pleased me extremely. I renewed my acquaintance with those works\r\nof the Romans which I had not seen since the day when I read some\r\nsheets of _Atala_ out of my knapsack in the amphitheatre at Trèves.\r\nSailing-boats crossed from one bank of the Saône to the other, carrying\r\na light at night; they were steered by women; a sailor lass of eighteen\r\nwho took me on board, at each turn of the helm, adjusted a nosegay\r\nof flowers badly fastened to her hat. I was awakened in the morning\r\nby the sound of bells. The convents poised upon the slopes seemed to\r\nhave recovered their solitary inmates. The son of M. Ballanche[475],\r\nthe owner, after M. Migneret, of the _Génie du Christianisme_, had\r\nbecome my host: he has become my friend. Who does not know to-day the\r\nChristian philosopher whose writings glow with that placid clearness on\r\nwhich one loves to fix his eyes, as on the ray of a friendly star in\r\nthe sky?\r\n\r\nOn the 27th of October the post-barge which was taking me to Avignon\r\nwas obliged to stop at Tain, owing to a storm. I thought myself\r\nin America: the Rhone reminded me of my great wild rivers. I was\r\nput into a little river-side inn; a conscript was standing at the\r\nchimney-corner; he had his sack on his back, and was on his way to join\r\nthe Army of Italy. I wrote with the bellows of the chimney for a table,\r\nopposite the landlady, who sat silently before me and showed her regard\r\nfor the traveller by preventing the dog and cat from making a noise.\r\nWhat I was writing was an article which I had almost finished while\r\ngoing down the Rhone, and which related to M. de Bonald's _Législation\r\nprimitive._ I foresaw what has since come to pass:\r\n\r\n    \"French literature,\" I said, \"is about to change its aspect;\r\n    with the Revolution new thoughts will come into being, new\r\n    views of men and things. It is easy to foresee that our\r\n    writers will become divided. Some will strive to leave the\r\n    beaten paths; others will try to copy the old models, while\r\n    nevertheless displaying them in a new light. It is very\r\n    probable that the latter will end by getting the better\r\n    of their adversaries, because, in leaning upon the great\r\n    traditions and the great men, they will have surer guides and\r\n    more fruitful documents.\"\r\n\r\nThe lines ending my travelling criticism are history; my mind was\r\nbeginning to move with my century:\r\n\r\n    \"The author of this article,\" I said, \"cannot resist an\r\n    image drawn from the circumstances in which he finds himself\r\n    placed. At the very moment at which he is writing these\r\n    concluding words he is descending one of the greatest rivers\r\n    of France. On two opposite mountains stand two ruined towers;\r\n    at the top of those towers are fastened little bells,\r\n    which the mountaineers ring as we pass. This river, those\r\n    mountains, those sounds, those Gothic monuments, divert the\r\n    eyes of the spectators for a moment; but not one stops to go\r\n    whither the bell-tower calls him. Thus the men who to-day\r\n    preach morality and religion in vain give the signal from\r\n    the top of their ruins to those whom the torrent of the age\r\n    carries with it; the traveller is amazed at the grandeur of\r\n    the ruins, at the sweetness of the sounds that issue from\r\n    them, at the majesty of the memories that rise above them,\r\n    but he does not interrupt his journey, and at the first turn\r\n    in the stream all is forgotten[476].\"\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Avignon.]\r\n\r\nWhen I arrived at Avignon, on the eve of All Saints' Day, a child\r\nhawking books offered them to me: I then and there bought three\r\ndifferent pirated editions of a little novel called _Atala_. By going\r\nfrom one bookseller to the other, I unearthed the pirate, to whom I was\r\nnot known. He sold me the four volumes of the _Génie du Christianisme_\r\nat the reasonable price of nine francs per copy, and praised both book\r\nand author highly to me. He lived in a fine house standing in its own\r\ngrounds. I thought I had made a great discovery: after four-and-twenty\r\nhours, I grew weary of following fortune, and made terms for next to\r\nnothing with the robber.\r\n\r\nI saw Madame de Janson, a little wizened, white-haired, determined\r\nwoman, who struggled with the Rhone for her estate, exchanged\r\nmusket-shots with the inhabitants of the banks, and defended herself\r\nagainst the years.\r\n\r\nAvignon reminded me of my fellow-countryman. Du Guesclin was good for\r\nmore than Bonaparte, because he rescued France from her conquerors. On\r\nreaching the city of the Popes with the adventurers whom his glory was\r\nleading to Spain, he said to the provost sent by the Pontiff to meet\r\nhim:\r\n\r\n*\r\n\r\n\"'Brother, do not deceive me: whence comes that treasure? Has the Pope\r\ntaken it from his treasure?'\r\n\r\n\"And he answered no, and that the commons of Avignon had paid it, each\r\nhis portion.\r\n\r\n\"'Then, provost,' said Bertrand, 'I promise you that we will not take\r\na farthing of it as we live, and wish that this money got together\r\nbe restored to them that paid it, and tell the Pope that he have it\r\nrestored to them; for if I knew that any other were done, it would lie\r\nheavy on me; and had I crossed the sea, yet would I return thence.'\r\n\r\n\"Thus was Bertrand paid with the Pope's money, and his folk absolved\r\nagain, and the said first absolution again confirmed.\"\r\n\r\n*\r\n\r\nIn former days Avignon was considered the commencement of a Transalpine\r\njourney: it was the entrance to Italy. The geographies say:\r\n\r\n\"The Rhone belongs to the King, but the City of Avignon is watered by a\r\nbranch of the river, the Sorgue, which belongs to the Pope.\"\r\n\r\nIs the Pope very certain of long preserving the ownership of the Tiber?\r\nAt Avignon they used to visit the Celestine[477] monastery. Good King\r\nRené[478], who reduced the taxes when the tramontane wind blew, had\r\npainted a skeleton in one of the halls of the Celestine monastery: it\r\nwas that of a woman of great beauty whom he had loved[479].\r\n\r\n*\r\n\r\nI looked for the Palace of the Popes and was shown the _ice-house_:\r\nthe Revolution has done away with celebrated places; the memories\r\nof the past are obliged to shoot up through it and to reblossom over\r\ndead bones[480]. Alas, the groans of the victims die soon after them!\r\nThey scarcely reach some echo that causes them to survive a little\r\nwhile after the voice from which they issued is extinguished for ever.\r\nBut, while the cry of sorrow was expiring on the banks of the Rhone,\r\none heard in the distance the sound of Petrarch's lute: a solitary\r\n_canzone_, escaping from the tomb, continued to charm Vaucluse[481]\r\nwith an immortal melancholy and the love sorrows of olden time.\r\n\r\nAlain Chartier[482] had come from Bayeux to be buried at Avignon in the\r\nChurch of St. Anthony. He had written the _Belle Dame sans mercy_, and\r\nthe kiss of Margaret of Scotland[483] made him live.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Marseilles.]\r\n\r\nFrom Avignon I went to Marseilles. What is left to be desired by a town\r\nto which Cicero addressed these words, of which the oratorical manner\r\nwas imitated by Bossuet:\r\n\r\n\"Nor will I forget thee, O Massilia, who in virtue and dignity shouldst\r\nrank not only before Greece, but for aught I know before the whole\r\nworld[484]!\"\r\n\r\nTacitus, in the Life of Agricola, also praises Marseilles as combining\r\nthe Greek urbanity with the economy of the Latin provinces. Daughter of\r\nHellas, foundress of Gaul, celebrated by Cicero, captured by Cæsar, is\r\nnot that sufficient glory united? I hastened to climb to _Notre Dame de\r\nla Garde_, to admire the sea which the smiling coasts of all the famous\r\ncountries of antiquity line with their ruins. The sea, which does not\r\nmove, is the source of mythology, even as the ocean, which rises twice\r\na day, is the abyss to which Jehovah said:\r\n\r\n\"Thou shalt go no farther[485].\"\r\n\r\nIn this same year, 1838, I climbed again to that summit; I saw again\r\nthat sea which I now know so well, and at the end of which rose the\r\nCross and the Tomb victorious. The mistral was blowing; I went into\r\nthe fort built by Francis I., where no longer a veteran of the army of\r\nEgypt kept guard, but where stood a conscript destined for Algiers and\r\nlost under the gloomy vaults. Silence reigned in the restored chapel,\r\nwhile the wind moaned without. The hymn of the Breton sailors to Our\r\nLady of Succour returned to my mind; you know when and how I have\r\nalready quoted that plaint of my early ocean days:\r\n\r\n    Je mets ma confiance,\r\n    Vierge, en votre secours.\r\n\r\nHow many events it had needed to bring me back to the feet of the \"Star\r\nof the Sea,\" to whom I had been vowed in my childhood! When I gazed at\r\nthose votive offerings, those paintings of ship-wrecks hung all around\r\nme, it was as though I were reading the story of my life. Virgil places\r\nthe Trojan hero beneath the Porches of Carthage, moved at the sight\r\nof a picture representing the burning of Troy, and the genius of the\r\nsinger of Hamlet has made use of the soul of the singer of Dido.\r\n\r\nI no longer recognised Marseilles at the foot of that rock once covered\r\nwith a forest sung by Lucan: I could no longer lose my way in its long,\r\nwide, straight streets. The harbour was crowded with ships; thirty-six\r\nyears ago I should with difficulty have found a \"boat,\" steered by a\r\ndescendant of Pytheas[486], to carry me to Cyprus like Joinville[487]:\r\ntime rejuvenates cities, reversing its action upon men. I preferred my\r\nold Marseilles, with its memories of the Bérengers[488], the Duke of\r\nAnjou[489], King René, Guise and d'Épernon[490], with the monuments of\r\nLouis XIV. and the virtues of Belsunce[491]: the wrinkles on its brow\r\npleased me. Perhaps, in regretting the years which it has lost, I but\r\nbewail those which I have found. Marseilles received me graciously, it\r\nis true; but the rival of Athens has grown too young for me.\r\n\r\nIf the _Memoirs_ of Alfieri[492] had been published in 1802 I should\r\nnot have left Marseilles without visiting the rock from which the poet\r\nused to bathe. That rugged man once succeeded in attaining the charm of\r\nreverie and of expression:\r\n\r\n    \"After the performance,\" he writes, \"one of my amusements,\r\n    at Marseilles, was to bathe almost every evening in the\r\n    sea; I had found a very agreeable spot, on a neck of land\r\n    situated to the right of the harbour, where, seated on the\r\n    sand, with my back leaning against a rock, which prevented\r\n    me from being seen from the land side, I could behold\r\n    the sky and sea without interruption. Between those two\r\n    immensities, embellished by the rays of the setting sun, I\r\n    passed delicious hours dreaming of future delights; and there\r\n    I might unquestionably have become a poet, could I have given\r\n    any language whatever to my thoughts and feelings[493].\"\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Jean Reboul.]\r\n\r\nI returned through Languedoc and Gascony. At Nîmes, the Arena[494] and\r\nthe Maison Carrée[495] had not yet been extricated: in the present\r\nyear, 1838, I have seen them exhumed. I have also looked up Jean\r\nReboul[496]. I had my doubts concerning those workmen poets, who are\r\ngenerally neither poets nor workmen: I owe M. Reboul a reparation. I\r\nfound him in his bakery; I spoke to him without knowing whom I was\r\naddressing, failing to distinguish him from his fellow-worshippers of\r\nCeres. He took my name and said he would go and see if the person for\r\nwhom I was asking was there. He returned soon after and introduced\r\nhimself: he took me into his shop; we wended our way through a\r\nlabyrinth of flour-sacks, and clambered up a sort of ladder into a\r\nlittle closet resembling the upper room of a wind-mill. There we sat\r\ndown and talked. I was as happy as in my garret in London, and happier\r\nthan in my ministerial armchair in Paris. M. Reboul drew a manuscript\r\nfrom a chest of drawers, and read me some powerful verses from a poem\r\nwhich he is writing on the _Dernier Jour._ I congratulated him on his\r\nreligion and his talent[497].\r\n\r\nI had to take leave of my host, not without wishing him the gardens\r\nof Horace. I would have better loved to see him dream beside the\r\nCascade at Tivoli than gather the wheat crushed by the wheel above that\r\ncascade. It is true that Sophocles was perhaps a blacksmith in Athens,\r\nand that Plautus, in Rome, was a harbinger of Reboul at Nîmes[498].\r\n\r\nBetween Nîmes and Montpellier, I passed, on my left, Aigues-Mortes,\r\nwhich I have visited in 1838. This town is still quite intact, with its\r\ntowers and its surrounding rampart; it resembles a large ship stranded\r\non the sands where St. Louis, time and the sea have left it. The\r\nSaint-king gave \"usages\" and statutes to the town of Aigues-Mortes:\r\n\r\n\"He wills that the prison be such that it serve not for the\r\nextermination of the person, but for its safe-keeping; that no\r\ninformation be granted for mere injurious words; that adultery itself\r\nbe not enquired into, except in certain cases; and that he who violates\r\na maid, _volente vel nolente_, shall not lose his life, nor any of his\r\nmembers, _sed alio modo puniatur._\"\r\n\r\nAt Montpellier I again saw the sea, to which I would gladly have\r\nwritten in the words of the Most Christian King to the Swiss\r\nConfederation: \"My trusty ally and well-beloved friend.\" Scaliger[499]\r\nwould have liked to make Montpellier \"the nest of his old age.\" It\r\nreceived its name from two virgin saints, _Mons puellarum_: hence the\r\nbeauty of its women. Montpellier[500], falling before the Cardinal de\r\nRichelieu, witnessed the death of the aristocratic constitution of\r\nFrance.\r\n\r\nOn the road from Montpellier to Narbonne, I had a return to my native\r\ndisposition, an attack of my dreaminess. I should have forgotten that\r\nattack if, like certain imaginary invalids, I had not entered the day\r\nof my crisis on a tiny bulletin, the only note of that time which I\r\nhave found to aid my memory. This time it was an arid space covered\r\nwith fox-gloves that made me forget the world: my eyes glided over\r\nthat sea of purple stalks, and encountered at the distance only the\r\nblue chain of the Cantal Mountains. In nature, with the exception\r\nof the sky, the sea and the sun, it is not the immense objects that\r\ninspire me; they give me only a sensation of greatness, which flings\r\nmy own littleness distraught and disconsolate at the feet of God. But a\r\nflower which I pick, a stream of water hiding among the rushes, a bird\r\nalternately flying and resting before my eyes lead me on towards all\r\nkinds of dreams. Is it not better to be moved for no definite reason\r\nthan to go through life seeking blunted interests, chilled by their\r\nrepetition and their number? All is worn out nowadays, even misfortune.\r\n\r\nAt Narbonne I reached the Canal des Deux-Mers[501]. Corneille, singing\r\nthis work, adds his own greatness to that of Louis XIV.[502]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Toulouse.]\r\n\r\nAt Toulouse, from the bridge over the Garonne, I could see the line of\r\nthe Pyrenees; I was to cross it four years later: our horizons succeed\r\none another like our days. They offered to show me, in a cave, the\r\ndried body of Fair Paule[503]: blessed are they that have not seen and\r\nhave believed! Montmorency[504] had been beheaded in the courtyard of\r\nthe town-hall: that head struck off must have been very important,\r\nsince they still speak of it after so many other heads have been taken\r\noff? I do not know if, in the history of criminal proceedings, there\r\nexists an eye-witness' evidence which has more clearly established a\r\nman's identity:\r\n\r\n    \"The fire and smoke which covered him,\" said Guitaut,\r\n    \"prevented me from recognising him; but seeing a man who,\r\n    after breaking six of our ranks, was still killing soldiers\r\n    in the seventh, I thought that it could be only M. de\r\n    Montmorency; I knew it for certain when I saw him thrown to\r\n    the ground under his dead horse.\"\r\n\r\nThe deserted Church of St. Sernin impressed me by its architecture.\r\nThis church is connected with the history of the Albigenses, which the\r\npoem so well translated by M. Fauriel[505] revives:\r\n\r\n    \"The gallant young count, his father's heir and the light of\r\n    his eyes, with the cross and the sword, enter together by\r\n    one of the doors. Not a single young girl remains in chamber\r\n    or on landing; the inhabitants of the town, great and small,\r\n    all come out to gaze upon the count as on a fair and blooming\r\n    rose.\"\r\n\r\nIt is to the time of Simon de Montfort[506] that the loss of the\r\n_langue d'Oc_ dates back:\r\n\r\n\"Simon, seeing himself lord of so many lands, bestowed them among the\r\ngentle men, both French and others, _atque loci leges dedimus_,\" say\r\nthe eight signatory archbishops and bishops.\r\n\r\nI should have liked to have had time to inquire at Toulouse after one\r\nof my great admirations, Cujas[507], writing, flat on the ground, with\r\nhis books spread around him. I do not know whether the memory has\r\nbeen preserved of his twice-married daughter Suzanne. Constancy had\r\nno great attractions for Suzanne, she set it at naught; but she kept\r\none of her husbands alive with the same infidelities which caused the\r\nother's death. Cujas was protected by the daughter of Francis I.[508],\r\nPibrac by the daughter of Henry II.[509]: two Margarets of the blood\r\nof the Valois, the true blood of the Muses. Pibrac[510] is famous\r\nthrough his quatrains, which have been translated into Persian. I was\r\nperhaps lodged in the house of the president his father. That \"good\r\nLord of Pibrac,\" according to Montaigne, was \"a man of so quaint and\r\nrare wit, of so sound judgment, and of so mild and affable behaviour.\"\r\nHis mind was \"so dissonant and different in proportion from our\r\ndeplorable corruption, and so farre from agreeing with our tumultuous\r\nstormes[511].\" And Pibrac wrote the apology of St. Bartholomew's Night!\r\n\r\nI hurried on without being able to stop: fate threw me back to 1838\r\nto admire in detail the city of Raimond de Saint-Gilles[512], and to\r\nspeak of the new acquaintances I made there: M. de Lavergne[513], a\r\nman of talent, wit, and sense; Mademoiselle Honorine Gasc[514], the\r\nMalibran of the future. The latter reminded me, in my new quality of a\r\nfollower of Clémence Isaure[515], of those verses which Chapelle and\r\nBachaumont[516] wrote in the isle of Ambijoux, near Toulouse:\r\n\r\n    Hélas! que l'on serait heureux\r\n    Dans ce beau lieu digne d'envie,\r\n    Si, toujours aimé de Sylvie,\r\n    On pouvait, toujours amoureux,\r\n    Avec elle passer sa vie[517]!\r\n\r\nLet Mademoiselle Honorine be on her guard against her beautiful voice!\r\nTalents are \"gold of Toulouse:\" they bring misfortune.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Bordeaux.]\r\n\r\nBordeaux was as yet scarce rid of its scaffolds and its dastardly\r\nGirondins. All the towns which I saw had the appearance of beautiful\r\nwomen lately risen from a violent malady, and hardly commencing to\r\nbreathe again. In Bordeaux, Louis XIV. had caused the Palais des\r\nTutelles to be razed, in order to build the Chateau Trompette[518];\r\nSpon[519] and the lovers of antiquity groaned:\r\n\r\nPourquoi démolit-on ces colonnes des dieux,\r\nOuvrage des Césars, monument tutélaire[520]?\r\n\r\nThere were but a few remains of the Arena to be seen. Were we to offer\r\na token of regret to all that falls, life would be too short for our\r\ntears.\r\n\r\nI took ship for Blaye. I saw the castle, then unknown, to which in 1833\r\nI addressed these words:\r\n\r\n\"O captive of Blaye[521], I am sorrow-stricken to be able to do nothing\r\nto forward your present destinies!\"\r\n\r\nI travelled towards Rochefort, and went on to Nantes through the Vendée.\r\n\r\nThis district bore the mutilations and scars due to its valour, like an\r\nold warrior. Bones bleached by time and ruins blackened by fire met the\r\ngaze. When the Vendeans were on the point of attacking the enemy, they\r\nknelt down to receive the blessing of a priest. Prayers uttered under\r\narms were not reckoned as weakness, for the Vendean who raised his\r\nsword towards Heaven asked for victory, not for life.\r\n\r\nThe diligence in which I found myself interred was full of travellers\r\nwho related the rapes and murders with which they had glorified their\r\nlives in the wars of the Vendée. My heart throbbed when, after crossing\r\nthe Loire at Nantes, we entered Brittany. I passed by the College of\r\nRennes, which witnessed the last years of my childhood. I was able to\r\nremain for only four-and-twenty hours with my wife and sisters, and I\r\nreturned to Paris.\r\n\r\n*\r\n\r\nI arrived in time for the death of a man who belonged to those superior\r\nnames of the second rank in the eighteenth century which, forming a\r\nsolid rear-line in society, gave it a certain fulness and consistency.\r\n\r\nI had known M. de La Harpe in 1789: like Flins, he had become smitten\r\nwith a great passion for my sister, Madame la Comtesse de Farcy.\r\nHe used to come up with three large volumes of his works under his\r\nlittle arms, quite astounded to find that his glory did not triumph\r\nover the most rebellious hearts. Loud-voiced, and eager in manner,\r\nhe thundered against every abuse, ordered an omelette to be made\r\nfor him at the ministers' houses when the dinner had not been to his\r\ntaste, eating with his fingers, dragging his cuffs in the dishes,\r\ntalking philosophical scurrilities to the greatest lords, who doted\r\non his impertinences; but, when all was said, his was an upright\r\nand enlightened mind, impartial amid all its passions, with a quick\r\nsense for talent, capable of admiration, of shedding tears over fine\r\npoetry or a fine action, and possessing a foundation fit to support\r\nrepentance. He was not wanting at the end; I saw him die the death\r\nof a brave Christian, with his taste enlarged by religion, and\r\nretaining no pride except as against impiety, no hatred except that of\r\n\"Revolutionary language[522].\"\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Death of M. de La Harpe.]\r\n\r\nOn my return from the Emigration, religion had disposed M. de La Harpe\r\nin favour of my works: the illness which attacked him did not prevent\r\nhim from working himself; he read me passages from a poem which he was\r\nwriting on the Revolution[523]; in it occurred notably some pithy lines\r\ndirected against the crimes of the age and the \"worthy men\" who had\r\npermitted them:\r\n\r\n    Mais s'ils ont tout osé, vous avez tout permis:\r\n    Plus l'oppresseur est vil, plus l'esclave est infâme[524].\r\n\r\nForgetting that he was ill, dressed in a wadded spencer, with a white\r\ncotton night-cap on his head, he recited with all his might; then,\r\ndropping his copy-book, he said in a voice that hardly reached the ear:\r\n\r\n\"I can't go on; I feel a grip of iron in my side.\"\r\n\r\nAnd if, unfortunately, a maid-servant should happen to pass by, he\r\nwould resume his stentorian voice and roar:\r\n\r\n\"Go away! Shut the door!\"\r\n\r\nI said to him one day:\r\n\r\n\"You will live for the good of religion.\"\r\n\r\n\"Ah, yes,\" he replied, \"it would certainly be for God; but He does not\r\nwish it, and I shall die within these few days.\"\r\n\r\nFalling back into his chair, and drawing his night-cap over his ears,\r\nhe expiated his former pride by his present resignation and humility.\r\n\r\nAt a dinner at Migneret's, I had heard him speak of himself with\r\nthe greatest modesty, declaring that he had done nothing out of\r\nthe common, but that he believed that art and the language had not\r\ndegenerated in his hands.\r\n\r\nM. de La Harpe quitted this life on the 11th of February 1803; the\r\nauthor of the _Saisons_ died almost at the same time, fortified with\r\nall the consolations of philosophy, as M. de La Harpe died fortified\r\nwith all the consolations of religion: the one was visited by men, the\r\nother by God.\r\n\r\nM. de La Harpe was buried on the 12th of February 1803 in the cemetery\r\nat the Barrière de Vaugirard. The coffin was placed beside the grave\r\non the little mound of earth that was soon to cover it, and M. de\r\nFontanes delivered a funeral oration. It was a dismal scene: whirling\r\nsnow-flakes fell from the clouds and covered the pall with white, while\r\nthe wind blew it upwards, to allow the last words of friendship to\r\nreach the ears of death. The cemetery has been destroyed and M. de La\r\nHarpe disinterred: there was hardly anything left of his poor ashes.\r\nM. de La Harpe had been married under the Directory, and had not been\r\nhappy with his beautiful wife; she had been seized with loathing at the\r\nsight of him, and had persisted in refusing him any of his rights[525].\r\n\r\nFor the rest, M. de La Harpe, like everything else, had diminished\r\nby the side of the Revolution, which was ever growing in dimensions:\r\nreputations hastily shrank away before the representative of that\r\nRevolution, even as dangers lost their power before him.\r\n\r\n*\r\n\r\nWhile we were engrossed with vulgar life and death, the gigantic\r\nprogress of the world was being realized; the Man of the Time was\r\ntaking the head of the table at the banquet of the human race. Amid\r\nvast commotions, precursors of the universal displacement, I had landed\r\nat Calais to bear my part in the general action, within the limits set\r\nto each soldier. I arrived, in the first year of the century, at the\r\ncamp where Bonaparte was beating the destinies to arms: soon after, he\r\nbecame First Consul for life.\r\n\r\nAfter the adoption of the Concordat by the Legislative Body in 1802,\r\nLucien, then Minister of the Interior, gave an entertainment to his\r\nbrother; I was invited, as having rallied the Christian forces and led\r\nthem back to the charge. I was in the gallery when Napoleon entered:\r\nhe struck me pleasantly; I had never seen him except at a distance.\r\nHis smile was beautiful and caressing; his eyes were admirable, owing\r\nespecially to the manner in which they were placed beneath his forehead\r\nand framed in his eyebrows. There was as yet no charlatanism in his\r\nglance, nothing theatrical or affected. The _Génie du Christianisme_,\r\nwhich was then making a great stir, had worked upon Napoleon. A\r\nprodigious imagination animated that so frigid politician: he would\r\nnot have been what he was, if the Muse had not been there; reason\r\nbut carried out the poet's ideas. All those men who lead the large\r\nlife are always a compound of two natures, for they must be capable\r\nof inspiration and of action: one conceives the plan, the other\r\naccomplishes it.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The First Consul.]\r\n\r\nBonaparte saw me and recognised me, I know not by what. When he turned\r\nin my direction no one knew whom he was making for; the ranks opened\r\nsuccessively; each hoped that the Consul would stop at him; he appeared\r\nto feel a certain impatience with those misconceptions. I hid behind my\r\nneighbours; suddenly Bonaparte raised his voice and said:\r\n\r\n\"Monsieur de Chateaubriand!\"\r\n\r\nI then remained standing out alone, for the crowd withdrew, and soon\r\nformed again in a circle around the speakers. Bonaparte addressed\r\nme with simplicity: without paying me any compliments, without idle\r\nquestions, without preamble, he spoke to me at once of Egypt and the\r\nArabs, as though I had been one of his intimates, and as though he were\r\nonly continuing a conversation already commenced between us.\r\n\r\n\"I was always much impressed,\" he said, \"when I saw the sheiks fall on\r\ntheir knees in the middle of the desert, turn towards the East, and\r\ntouch the sand with their foreheads. What was that unknown thing which\r\nthey worshipped in the East?\"\r\n\r\nBonaparte interrupted himself and broached another idea without any\r\ntransition:\r\n\r\n\"Christianity! Have not the ideologists tried to make a system of\r\nastronomy of it? And if that should be so, do they think they can\r\npersuade me that Christianity is small? If Christianity is the allegory\r\nof the movement of the spheres, the geometry of the stars, the\r\nfree-thinkers may say what they please: in spite of themselves, they\r\nhave still left tolerable greatness to 'the infamous thing.'\"\r\n\r\nIncontinently Bonaparte moved away. As with Job, in my night \"a spirit\r\npassed before me, the hair of my flesh stood up. There stood one whose\r\ncountenance I knew not ... and I heard the voice as it were of a\r\ngentle wind[526].\"\r\n\r\nMy days have been but a series of visions; Hell and Heaven have\r\ncontinually opened up beneath my feet or over my head, without giving\r\nme time to explore their darkness or their light. One single time, on\r\nthe shore of the two worlds, I met the man of the last and the man of\r\nthe new century: Washington and Napoleon. I conversed for a moment with\r\neach; both sent me back to solitude: the first through a kindly wish,\r\nthe second through a crime.\r\n\r\nI observed that, when going round among the crowd, Bonaparte cast\r\ndeeper glances on me than those which he had fixed upon me while\r\ntalking to me. I too followed him with my eyes:\r\n\r\n    Chi è quel grande che non par che curi\r\n    L'incendio[527]?\r\n\r\nIn consequence of this interview, Bonaparte thought of me for Rome:\r\nhe had decided at a glance where and how I could be of use to him. It\r\nmattered little to him that I had no experience of public affairs, that\r\nI was entirely unacquainted with practical diplomacy; he believed that\r\na given mind always understands and has no need of apprenticeship. He\r\nwas a great discoverer of men: but he wished them to possess talent\r\nonly for him, and even then on condition that that talent was not much\r\ndiscussed; jealous of every renown, he regarded it as an usurpation\r\nover his own: there was to be none save Napoleon in the universe.\r\n\r\nFontanes and Madame Bacciochi spoke to me of the pleasure the Consul\r\nhad found in \"my conversation:\" I had not opened my mouth; that meant\r\nthat Bonaparte was pleased with himself. They urged me to avail myself\r\nof fortune. The idea of being anything had never occurred to me; I\r\nflatly refused. Then they persuaded an authority to speak whom it was\r\ndifficult for me to resist.\r\n\r\nThe Abbé Émery[528], the superior of the Seminary of Saint-Sulpice,\r\ncame and entreated me, in the name of the clergy, to accept, for\r\nthe good of religion, the post of first secretary to the embassy\r\nwhich Bonaparte had reserved for his uncle, Cardinal Fesch[529]. He\r\ngave me to understand that the cardinal's intelligence was not very\r\nremarkable and that I should soon find myself the master of affairs.\r\nA singular chance had brought me into connection with the Abbé Émery:\r\nI had crossed to the United States with the Abbé Nagat and several\r\nseminarists, as you know. That remembrance of my obscurity, my youth,\r\nmy life as a traveller, which reflected itself in my public life,\r\nseized hold of my imagination and my heart. The Abbé Émery, who was\r\nesteemed by Bonaparte, was subtle by nature and by reason of his cloth\r\nand of the Revolution; but he used that threefold subtlety only on\r\nbehalf of his true merit; ambitious only to do good, he acted only in\r\nthe most prosperous circle of a seminary. Circumspect as he was in his\r\nactions and words, it would have been superfluous to do violence to the\r\nAbbé Émery, for he always held his life at your disposal, in exchange\r\nfor his will, which he never surrendered: his strength lay in waiting\r\nfor you, seated on his tomb.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: I am sent to Rome.]\r\n\r\nHe failed in his first attempt; he returned to the charge, and his\r\npatience ended by persuading me. I accepted the place which he had\r\nbeen commissioned to offer me, without being in the smallest degree\r\nconvinced of my usefulness in the post to which I was called: I am no\r\ngood at all in the second rank. I might perhaps have again withdrawn,\r\nif the thought of Madame de Beaumont had not come to put an end to my\r\nscruples. M. de Montmorin's daughter was dying; she had been told that\r\nthe climate of Italy would be favourable to her; if I went to Rome she\r\nwould make up her mind to cross the Alps. I sacrificed myself to the\r\nhope of saving her. Madame de Chateaubriand prepared to come to join\r\nme; M. Joubert spoke of accompanying her; and Madame de Beaumont set\r\nout for Mont-Dore[530], in order afterwards to complete her cure on the\r\nbanks of the Tiber.\r\n\r\nM. de Talleyrand[531] occupied the Ministry for Foreign Affairs; he\r\nsent me my nomination. I dined with him: he has always maintained in\r\nmy mind the place which he occupied at our first meeting. For the\r\nrest, his fine manners made a contrast with those of the ruffians of\r\nhis environment; his profligacy assumed an astounding importance: in\r\nthe eyes of a brutal gang, moral corruption seemed genius, frivolity\r\nprofundity. The Revolution was over-modest; it did not sufficiently\r\nappreciate its superiority: it is not the same thing to stand above\r\ncrimes or beneath them.\r\n\r\nI saw the ecclesiastics attached to the cardinal's person; I remarked\r\nthe gay Abbé de Bonnevie[532]: formerly, in his capacity as chaplain\r\nto the Army of the Princes, he had taken part in the retreat from\r\nVerdun; he had also been grand-vicar to the Bishop of Châlons, M. de\r\nClermont-Tonnerre[533], who set out behind us in order to claim a\r\npension from the Holy See, in his quality as a \"Chiaramonte[534].\" So\r\nsoon as my preparations were completed I started: I was to precede\r\nNapoleon's uncle to Rome.\r\n\r\n*\r\n\r\nIn Lyons I again saw my friend M. Ballanche. I witnessed the revival of\r\nCorpus Christi: I felt as though I had in some way contributed to those\r\nposies of flowers, to that joy of Heaven which I had called back to\r\nearth.\r\n\r\nI continued my journey, finding a cordial welcome wherever I went:\r\nmy name was linked with the restoration of the altars. The keenest\r\npleasure which I have experienced has been to feel myself honoured in\r\nFrance and abroad with marks of serious interest. It has sometimes\r\nhappened that, while resting in a village inn, I saw a father and\r\nmother enter with their son: they told me they were bringing their\r\nchild to thank me. Was it self-conceit that then gave me the pleasure\r\nof which I speak? How did it affect my vanity that lowly and honest\r\npeople should give me a token of their satisfaction on the high-road,\r\nin a place where none overheard them? What did touch me, at least I\r\nventure to think so, was that I had done some little good, consoled\r\na few distressed, caused the hope to revive in a mother's yearnings\r\nof bringing up a Christian son: that is to say, a submissive son,\r\nrespectful, attached to his parents. Should I have tasted this pure joy\r\nif I had written a book which morals or religion would have had cause\r\nto bewail?\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: My journey to Rome.]\r\n\r\nThe road is somewhat dreary on leaving Lyons: after leaving the\r\nTour-du-Pin, as far as Pont-de-Beauvoisin, it is shady and wooded. At\r\nChambéry, where Bayard's chivalrous soul showed itself so fine, a man\r\nwas welcomed by a woman, and by way of payment for the hospitality\r\nreceived at her hands, thought himself philosophically obliged to\r\ndishonour her. That is the danger of literature: the desire to make\r\na stir gets the better of generous sentiment; if Rousseau had never\r\nbecome a celebrated writer, he would have buried in the valleys of\r\nSavoy the frailties of the woman who had fed him; he would have\r\nsacrificed himself to the very faults of his friend; he would have\r\nrelieved her in her old age, instead of contenting himself with giving\r\nher a snuff-box and running away. Ah, may the voice of friendship\r\nbetrayed never be raised against our tombstones!\r\n\r\nAfter passing Chambéry, one comes to the stream of the Isère. On every\r\nhand, in the valleys, one meets with road-side crosses and lady-statues\r\nfixed in the trunks of the pine-trees. The little churches, surrounded\r\nwith trees, form a touching contrast with the great mountains. When the\r\nwinter whirlwinds come sweeping down from those ice-laden summits, the\r\nSavoyard takes shelter in his rustic temple and prays.\r\n\r\nThe valleys which one enters above Montmélian are hemmed by mountains\r\nof different shapes, sometimes half bare, sometimes clad in forests.\r\nAiguebelle seems to shut in the Alps; but, on turning round an isolated\r\nrock, fallen in the middle of the road, you catch sight of new valleys\r\nattached to the course of the Arc. The mountains on either side stand\r\nerect; their flanks become perpendicular; their barren summits begin to\r\ndisplay a few glaciers: torrents come rushing down to swell the Arc,\r\nwhich runs madly along. Amid this tumult of the waters, one remarks\r\na light cascade which falls with infinite grace beneath a curtain of\r\nwillows.\r\n\r\nAfter crossing Saint-Jean-de-Maurienne I arrived towards sunset at\r\nSaint-Michel, and found no horses. I was obliged to stop, and went for\r\na stroll outside the village. The air became transparent on the ridge\r\nof the mountains; their denticulation was outlined with extraordinary\r\nclearness, while a great darkness, issuing from their feet, rose\r\ntowards their crests. The note of the nightingale was heard below, the\r\ncry of the eagle above; the blossoming lote-tree stood in the valley,\r\nthe white snow on the mountain. A castle, popularly believed to be the\r\nwork of the Carthaginians, showed upon the sheer-cut redan. There,\r\nincorporated with the rock, had stood one man's hatred, overcoming all\r\nobstacles. The vengeance of the human race weighed down upon a free\r\npeople, which was able to build its greatness only with the slavery and\r\nblood of the rest of the world.\r\n\r\nI left at day-break and arrived at about two o'clock in the afternoon\r\nat Lans-le-Bourg, at the foot of Mont Cenis. On entering the village,\r\nI saw a peasant who held an eaglet by the feet; a pitiless band struck\r\nthe young king, insulted his youthful weakness and fallen majesty; the\r\nfather and mother of the noble orphan had been killed. They offered\r\nto sell him to me: he died of the ill-treatment to which he had been\r\nsubjected before I was able to deliver him. I then remembered poor\r\nlittle Louis XVII.; to-day I think of Henry V.: what swiftness of\r\ndownfall and misfortune!\r\n\r\nHere one begins to ascend Mont Cenis and leave the little River Arc,\r\nwhich brings you to the foot of the mountain. On the other side of Mont\r\nCenis, the Dora opens the entrance of Italy to you. Rivers are not only\r\n\"moving high-roads,\" as Pascal calls them, but they also mark the road\r\nfor men.\r\n\r\nStanding for the first time on the summit of the Alps, I was seized\r\nwith a strange emotion. I was like the lark which had just crossed\r\nthe frozen upland, and which, after singing its little burden of the\r\nplains, had alighted amid the snows, instead of dropping down upon the\r\nharvest. The stanzas with which those mountains inspired me in 1822\r\nreflect with some accuracy my feeling on the same spot in 1803:\r\n\r\n    Alpes, vous n'avez point subi mes destinées!\r\n       Le temps ne vous peut rien;\r\n    Vos fronts légèrement ont porté les années\r\n       Qui pèsent sur le mien.\r\n\r\n    Pour la première fois, quand, rempli d'espérance,\r\n       Je franchis vos remparts,\r\n    Ainsi que l'horizon, un avenir immense\r\n       S'ouvrait à mes regards.\r\n\r\n    L'Italie à mes pieds, et devant moi le monde[535]!\r\n\r\nThat world, have I really penetrated into it? Christopher Columbus saw\r\nan apparition which showed him the land of his dreams before he had\r\ndiscovered it; Vasco de Gama met the giant of the storms on his road:\r\nwhich of those two great men presaged my future? What I should have\r\nloved above all would have been a life glorious through a brilliant\r\nresult, and obscure through its destiny. Do you know which were the\r\nfirst European ashes to rest in America? They were those of Bjorn the\r\nScandinavian: he died on landing at Winland, and was buried by his\r\ncompanions on a promontory. Who knows that[536]? Who knows of him whose\r\nsail preceded the vessel of the Genoese pilot to the New World? Bjorn\r\nsleeps on the point of an unknown cape, and since a thousand years his\r\nname has been handed down to us only by the sagas of the poets, in a\r\nlanguage no longer spoken.\r\n\r\n*\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Italy.]\r\n\r\nI had begun my wanderings in an opposite direction to that of other\r\ntravellers. The old forests of America had displayed themselves to\r\nme before the old cities of Europe. I happened upon the latter when\r\nthey were at the same time renewing their youth and dying in a fresh\r\nrevolution. Milan was occupied by our troops; they were completing the\r\ndemolition of the castle, that witness to the wars of the Middle Ages.\r\n\r\nThe French army was settling in the plains of Lombardy as a military\r\ncolony. Guarded here and there by their comrades on sentry, these\r\nstrangers from Gaul, with forage-caps on their heads and sabres by way\r\nof reaping-hooks over their round jackets, presented the appearance\r\nof gay and eager harvesters. They moved stones, rolled guns, drove\r\nwaggons, ran up sheds and huts of brushwood. Horses pranced, curveted,\r\nreared among the crowd, like dogs fawning on their masters. Italian\r\nwomen sold fruit on their flat baskets at the market of that armed\r\nfair; our soldiers made them presents of their pipes and steels, saying\r\nto them as the ancient barbarians, their ancestors, said to their\r\nbeloved:\r\n\r\n\"I, Fotrad, son of Eupert, of the race of the Franks, give to\r\nthee, Helgine, my dear wife, in honour of thy beauty (_in honore\r\npulchritudinis tuæ_), my dwelling in the quarter of the Pines[537].\"\r\n\r\nWe are curious enemies: we are at first considered rather insolent,\r\nrather too gay, too restless; but we have no sooner turned our backs\r\nthan we are regretted. Lively, witty, intelligent, the French soldier\r\nmixes in the occupations of the inhabitant on whom he is billeted: he\r\ndraws water at the well, as Moses did for the daughters of Madian,\r\ndrives away the shepherds, takes the lambs to the washing-place, chops\r\nthe wood, lights the fire, watches the pot, carries the baby in his\r\narms, or sends it to sleep in its cradle. His good humour and activity\r\nput life into everything; one grows to look upon him as a conscript of\r\nthe family. Does the drum beat? The lodger runs to his musket, leaves\r\nhis host's daughters weeping on the threshold, and quits the cabin of\r\nwhich he will never think again until he is admitted to the Invalides.\r\n\r\nOn my passage through Milan, a great people aroused was for a moment\r\nopening its eyes. Italy was recovering from her sleep, and remembering\r\nher genius as it were a heavenly dream: useful to our reviving\r\ncountry, she brought to the shabbiness of our poverty the grandeur\r\nof the Transalpine nature, nurtured as she was, that Ausonia, on the\r\nmaster-pieces of the arts and the lofty reminiscences of the famous\r\nmotherland. Austria has come; she has again laid her cloak of lead\r\nover the Italians; she has forced them back into their coffin. Rome\r\nhas re-entered her ruins, Venice her sea. Venice sank down, while\r\nbeautifying the sky with her last smile; she set all charming in her\r\nwaves, like a star doomed to rise no more.\r\n\r\nGeneral Murat was in command at Milan. I had a letter for him from\r\nMadame Bacciochi. I spent the day with the aides-de-camp; these were\r\nnot so poor as my comrades before Thionville. French politeness\r\nreappeared under arms; it was bent upon showing that it still belonged\r\nto the days of Lautrec[538].\r\n\r\nI dined in state, on the 23rd of June, with M. de Melzi[539], on the\r\noccasion of the christening of a son of General Murat[540]. M. de\r\nMelzi had known my brother; the manners of the Vice-President of the\r\nCisalpine Republic were distinguished; his household resembled that of\r\na prince who had never been anything else. He treated me politely and\r\ncoldly; he found me in exactly the same disposition as himself.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: First glimpses of Rome.]\r\n\r\nI reached my destination on the evening of the 27th of June, the day\r\nbefore the eve of St. Peter's Day[541]. The Prince of Apostles was\r\nawaiting me, even as my indigent patron[542] received me since at\r\nJerusalem. I had followed the road of Florence, Siena, and Radicofani.\r\nI hastened to go to call upon M. Cacault[543], whom Cardinal Fesch was\r\nsucceeding, while I was replacing M. Artaud[544].\r\n\r\nOn the 28th of June, I ran about all day, and cast a first glance upon\r\nthe Coliseum, the Pantheon, the Trajan Column, and the Castle of St.\r\nAngelo. In the evening, M. Artaud took me to a ball at a house in the\r\nneighbourhood of the Piazza San-Pietro. One saw the fiery girandole of\r\nthe dome of Michael Angelo in between the whirling waltzes spinning\r\nbefore the open windows; the rockets of the fireworks on the Molo\r\nd'Adriano spread out brilliantly at Sant' Onofrio, over Tasso's tomb:\r\nsilence, solitude and night filled the Roman Campagna.\r\n\r\nThe next day, I assisted at the St. Peter's Mass. Pius VII.[545], pale,\r\nsad and religious, was the real pontiff of tribulations. Two days later\r\nI was presented to His Holiness: he made me sit beside him. A volume\r\nof the _Génie du Christianisme_ lay open, in an obliging fashion, upon\r\nhis table. Cardinal Consalvi[546], supple and firm, gently and politely\r\nresistant, was the living embodiment of the old Roman policy, minus the\r\nfaith of those days and plus the tolerance of the century.\r\n\r\nWhen going through the Vatican, I stopped to contemplate those\r\nstaircases which one can ascend on mule-back, those sloping galleries\r\nfolding one upon the other, adorned with master-pieces, along which\r\nthe popes of old used to pass with all their pomp, those _loggie_\r\ndecorated by so many immortal artists, admired by so many illustrious\r\nmen, Petrarch, Tasso, Ariosto, Montaigne, Milton, Montesquieu, and\r\nqueens and kings, mighty or fallen, and a whole people of pilgrims from\r\nthe four quarters of the globe: all that now without movement or sound;\r\na theatre whose deserted tiers, open to solitude alone, are scarce\r\nvisited by a ray of the sun.\r\n\r\nI had been advised to take a walk by moonlight: from the top of the\r\nTrinità-del-Monte, the distant buildings looked like a painter's\r\nsketches or like softened coast-lines seen from the deck of a ship at\r\nsea. The orb of night, that globe supposed to be an extinct world,\r\nturned its pale deserts above the deserts of Rome; it cast its light\r\nupon streets without inhabitants, closes, squares, gardens where none\r\npassed, monasteries where the voices of the cenobites were no longer\r\nheard, cloisters as mute and desolate as the porticoes of the Coliseum.\r\n\r\nWhat happened, eighteen centuries ago, at this very hour and in this\r\nvery spot? What men have here crossed the shadow of those obelisks,\r\nafter that shadow had ceased to fall upon the sands of Egypt? Not\r\nonly is Ancient Italy no more, but the Italy of the Middle Ages has\r\ndisappeared. Nevertheless, traces of the two Italies still linger in\r\nthe Eternal City: where modern Rome shows its St. Peter's and its\r\nmaster-pieces, ancient Rome boasts its Pantheon and its remains;\r\nwhere, on the one hand, the consuls walked down from the Capitol, on\r\nthe other, the pontiffs issued from the Vatican. The Tiber separates\r\nthe two glories: seated in the same dust, pagan Rome sinks deeper\r\nand deeper into its tombs, and Christian Rome glides slowly into its\r\ncatacombs.\r\n\r\n*\r\n\r\nCardinal Fesch had hired the Palazzo Lancelotti, not far from the\r\nTiber: I have since seen the Principessa Lancelotti there, in 1828.\r\nThe top floor of the palace was allotted to me; when I entered, so\r\nlarge a number of fleas hopped on to my legs that my white trousers\r\nwere quite black with them. The Abbé de Bonnevie and I did the best\r\nwe could to get our lodging washed down. I had a feeling as though I\r\nhad returned to my kennel in the New Road; this memory of my poverty\r\nwas not altogether unpleasant. Once settled in this diplomatic corner,\r\nI began to deliver pass-ports and to busy myself with functions of\r\nsimilar importance. My handwriting was an obstacle to my talents, and\r\nCardinal Fesch shrugged his shoulders whenever he saw my signature. As\r\nI had almost nothing to do in my aerial chamber, I looked across the\r\nroofs at some washing-girls in a neighbouring house, who made signs to\r\nme; a future opera-singer, practising her voice, persecuted me with her\r\neverlasting _solfeggio_; I was happy when some funeral passed by for a\r\nchange! From my lofty window I saw, in the abyss of the street below,\r\nthe convoy of a young mother: she was carried, her face uncovered,\r\nbetween two files of white pilgrims; her new-born babe, dead too and\r\ncrowned with flowers, lay at her feet.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: My work at the embassy.]\r\n\r\nI committed a great mistake: I very innocently believed it my duty to\r\ncall upon illustrious personages; I coolly went and paid the tribute of\r\nmy respects to the ex-King of Sardinia[547]. This unusual proceeding\r\ncaused a terrible hubbub; the diplomatists all drew themselves up.\r\n\r\n\"He is lost! he is lost!\" whispered all the train-bearers and\r\n_attachés_, with the charitable pleasure which men take in the mishaps\r\nof any of their fellow-creatures. No diplomatic dunce but thought\r\nhimself superior to me by the full height of his stupidity. Every\r\none hoped for my fall, notwithstanding that I was nobody and counted\r\nas nobody; no matter, it was some one who fell, and that is always\r\nagreeable. I, in my simplicity, had no notion of my crime, nor, as ever\r\nsince, would I have given a straw for any place whatever. Kings, to\r\nwhom I was believed to attach so great an importance, had in my eyes\r\nonly that of misfortune. My shocking blunders were reported from Rome\r\nto Paris: luckily I had to do with Bonaparte; what should have been my\r\nruin saved me.\r\n\r\nHowever, if at once and at the first leap to become First Secretary\r\nof Embassy under a prince of the Church, an uncle of Napoleon, seemed\r\nsomething, it was nevertheless as though I had been a copying-clerk in\r\na prefect's office. In the contests that were at hand, I might have\r\nfound work; but I was initiated into no mysteries. I was perfectly\r\nsatisfied to be set to the litigious business of the _chancellerie_:\r\nbut what was the use of wasting my time over details within the\r\ncapacity of all the clerks?\r\n\r\nOn returning from my long walks and my rambles along the Tiber, all\r\nthat I found to interest me was the cardinal's parsimonious worrying,\r\nthe heraldic boasting of the Bishop of Châlons, and the incredible\r\nlying of the future Bishop of Morocco[548]. The Abbé Guillon, taking\r\nadvantage of a similarity between his name and one almost identical\r\nin sound, pretended that he was the man who, after escaping by a\r\nmiracle from the massacre at the Carmes, gave absolution to Madame de\r\nLamballe[549] at the Force. He bragged that he had been the author of\r\nRobespierre's speech to the Supreme Being. I bet one day that I would\r\nmake him say that he had been to Russia: he did not quite agree to\r\nthis, but he modestly confessed that he had spent a few months in St.\r\nPetersburg.\r\n\r\nM. de La Maisonfort[550], a man of intelligence, then in hiding,\r\napplied to me for assistance, and soon M. Bertin the Elder[551],\r\nproprietor of the _Débats_, helped me with his friendly offices in a\r\npainful circumstance. Exiled to the island of Elba by the man who, when\r\nhimself returned from Elba, drove him to Ghent, M. Bertin, in 1803, had\r\nobtained from the Republican M. Briot[552], whom I have known, leave\r\nto complete his exile in Italy. With him I visited the ruins of Rome,\r\nand was present at the death of Madame de Beaumont: two things which\r\nhave connected his life with mine. A refined critic, he gave me, as\r\ndid his brother, excellent advice about my works. Had he been elected\r\nto Parliament, he would have shown a real talent for oratory. He had\r\nlong been a Legitimist, had undergone the trial of imprisonment in the\r\nTemple and transportation to Elba, and his principles have in reality\r\nremained the same. I will be true to the companion of my sad days; it\r\nwould be paying too high a price for all the political opinions of the\r\nworld to sacrifice one hour of sincere friendship: it is enough that\r\nmy opinions will never vary, and that I shall remain attached to my\r\nmemories.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The Princesse Borghèse.]\r\n\r\nAbout the middle of my stay in Rome, the Princesse Borghèse[553]\r\narrived; I had some shoes to deliver to her from Paris. I was\r\npresented to her; she made her toilet in my presence; the slippers\r\nwhich she put on her young and pretty feet were but for a moment to\r\ntread this ancient soil.\r\n\r\nAt last a sorrow came to give me occupation: we can always rely upon\r\nthat resource.\r\n\r\n*\r\n\r\nAt the time of my departure from France we had greatly blinded\r\nourselves regarding Madame de Beaumont's condition; she cried much,\r\nand her will has proved that she believed herself to be condemned.\r\nNevertheless her friends, refraining from communicating their fears\r\nto one another, sought to console each other; they believed in the\r\nmiraculous powers of the waters, to be perfected later by the Italian\r\nsun; they separated and took different roads; appointments were made in\r\nRome.\r\n\r\nFragments written by Madame de Beaumont in Paris, at Mont-Dore, in\r\nRome, and discovered among her papers, display her state of mind:\r\n\r\n    \"PARIS.\r\n\r\n    \"For some years past my health has been perceptibly\r\n    declining. Symptoms which I thought to be the signal for\r\n    departure have supervened before I am ready to depart. The\r\n    illusions increase as the illness progresses. I have seen\r\n    many examples of that singular weakness, and I perceive that\r\n    they will avail me nothing. Already I find myself taking\r\n    remedies which are as irksome as they are insignificant, and\r\n    I shall doubtless have no greater strength to protect myself\r\n    against the cruel remedies with which they never fail to\r\n    martyrize those condemned to die of consumption. Like the\r\n    others, I shall abandon myself to hope: to hope! Can I, then,\r\n    wish to live? My past life has been a series of misfortunes,\r\n    my present life is full of excitements and disturbances:\r\n    peace of mind has fled from me for ever. My death would be a\r\n    momentary sorrow to a few, a boon to others, and the greatest\r\n    of boons to myself.\r\n\r\n    \"This 21st of Floréal, 10 May, is the anniversary of the\r\n    death of my mother and brother:\r\n\r\n    Je péris la dernière et la plus misérable[554]!\r\n\r\n    [Sidenote: Illness of madame de Beaumont.]\r\n\r\n    \"Oh, why have I not the courage to die? This illness,\r\n    which I was almost weak enough to dread, has subsided, and\r\n    perhaps I am condemned still to live long; it seems to me,\r\n    nevertheless, that I would gladly die:\r\n\r\n    Mes jours ne valent pas qu'il m'en coûte un soupir[555].\r\n\r\n    \"None has more cause than I to complain of nature: by\r\n    refusing me everything, it has given me the sense of all\r\n    I lack. At every moment I feel the weight of the complete\r\n    mediocrity to which I am condemned. I know that self-content\r\n    and happiness are often the price of this mediocrity of which\r\n    I complain so bitterly; but by not adding to it the gift of\r\n    illusion, nature, in my case, has turned it into a torture.\r\n    I am like a fallen creature who cannot forget what he has\r\n    lost, and who has not the force to recover it. That absolute\r\n    lack of illusion, and hence of enthusiasm, is the cause of my\r\n    unhappiness in a thousand ways. I judge myself as a stranger\r\n    might do, and I see my friends as they are. My only value\r\n    lies in an extreme kindness of heart, which is not active\r\n    enough to command appreciation, nor to be of any real use,\r\n    and which loses all its charm owing to the impatience of my\r\n    character: my suffering from the misfortunes of others is\r\n    greater than my power to relieve them. Nevertheless, I owe to\r\n    it the few real joys that have occurred in my life; I owe to\r\n    it especially my ignorance of envy, the common attribute of\r\n    conscious mediocrity.\"\r\n\r\n    \"MONT DORE.\r\n\r\n    \"I had intended to enter into a few details concerning\r\n    myself, but _ennui_ causes the pen to drop from my fingers.\r\n\r\n    \"All the bitterness and painfulness of my position would\r\n    change to happiness if I were sure that I had but a few\r\n    months to live.\r\n\r\n    \"Even if I had the strength myself to end my sorrows in\r\n    the only possible way, I should not exert it: it would\r\n    be defeating my own intention, showing the measure of my\r\n    suffering, and leaving too grievous a wound in the heart\r\n    which I have deemed worthy to sustain me in my trials.\r\n\r\n    \"I 'beseech myself in tears' to take a step which is as\r\n    rigorous as it is inevitable. Charlotte Corday says that\r\n    'every act of self-sacrifice bestows more pleasure in the\r\n    execution than it has cost pain in the conception;' but her\r\n    death was near at hand, and I may still live long. What will\r\n    become of me? Where can I hide? What tomb shall I choose? How\r\n    can I shut out hope? What power can block up the door?\r\n\r\n    \"To go away in silence, to court oblivion, to bury myself\r\n    for ever, that is the duty laid upon me which I hope to have\r\n    the courage to fulfill. If the cup is too bitter, once I am\r\n    forgotten, nothing can compel me to empty it to the dregs,\r\n    and who knows but my life may, after all, not be so long as I\r\n    fear.\r\n\r\n    \"If I had decided upon the place of my retirement, I believe\r\n    I should be more calm; but the difficulty of the moment adds\r\n    to the difficulties that arise from my weakness, and it\r\n    requires something supernatural to act against one's self\r\n    with vigour, to treat one's self as harshly as a violent and\r\n    cruel enemy could do.\"\r\n\r\n    \"ROME, 28 _October._\r\n\r\n    \"During the past ten months I have never ceased to suffer.\r\n    During the last six, all the symptoms of consumption, and\r\n    some in the last degree: I lack only the illusions, and maybe\r\n    I have some!\"\r\n\r\nM. Joubert, alarmed at this desire for death which was torturing Madame\r\nde Beaumont, addressed these words to her in his _Pensées_:\r\n\r\n    \"Love life and respect it, if not for its own sake, at least\r\n    for that of your friends. In whatever state your own may\r\n    be, I shall always prefer to know that you are occupied in\r\n    spinning it out rather than in tearing it to pieces.\"\r\n\r\nAt the same time my sister was writing to Madame de Beaumont. I have\r\nthe correspondence, which death placed in my hands. The poetry of the\r\nancients pictures one of the Nereids as a flower floating on the deep;\r\nLucile was that flower. In comparing her letters with the fragments\r\njust quoted, one is struck by the similarity of heart-heaviness\r\nexpressed in the different language of those unhappy angels. When I\r\nthink that I have lived in the company of such minds as those, I am\r\nsurprised at my own insignificance. My eyes never light without bitter\r\ngrief upon those pages written by two superlative women, who vanished\r\nfrom this earth at a short distance one from the other.\r\n\r\n    \"LASCARDAIS, 30 _July._\r\n\r\n    \"I was so much charmed, madame, at last to receive a letter\r\n    from you that I did not allow myself the time to have the\r\n    pleasure of reading it through at once: I interrupted its\r\n    perusal to go and tell all the inmates of this house that I\r\n    had heard from you, without considering that my gladness is\r\n    of but little importance here, and that hardly anyone even\r\n    knows that I am in correspondence with you. Seeing that I was\r\n    surrounded by indifferent faces, I went back to my room, and\r\n    determined to be glad by myself. I sat down to finish reading\r\n    your letter, and, although I have read it over many times,\r\n    in truth, madame, I do not know the whole contents. The joy\r\n    which I constantly feel at the sight of this so long desired\r\n    letter interferes with the attention which I ought to give to\r\n    it.\r\n\r\n    [Sidenote: Letters from Lucile.]\r\n\r\n    \"And so you are going away, madame? Do not, once you have\r\n    reached Mont-Dore, forget your health; give it all your care,\r\n    I entreat you, with all the fervour and affection of my\r\n    heart. My brother has written to me that he hopes to see you\r\n    in Italy. Fate and nature alike are pleased to distinguish\r\n    him from me in a very favourable manner. But at least I will\r\n    not yield to my brother the happiness of loving you: that I\r\n    will share with him all my life. Alas, madame, how oppressed\r\n    and downcast is my heart! You cannot know the good your\r\n    letters do me, the contempt with which they inspire me for my\r\n    ills! The idea that you think of me, that you are interested\r\n    in me, exalts my courage extraordinarily. Write to me\r\n    therefore, madame, so that I may cherish an idea so essential\r\n    to me.\r\n\r\n    \"I have not yet seen M. Chênedollé; I long greatly for\r\n    his arrival. I shall be able to tell him of you and of M.\r\n    Joubert: that will be a great pleasure to me. Allow me,\r\n    madame, once more to urge you to think of your health, the\r\n    bad condition of which incessantly afflicts me and occupies\r\n    my thoughts. How can you not love yourself? You are so\r\n    lovable and so dear to all: have the justice, then, to do\r\n    much for yourself.\r\n\r\n    \"LUCILE.\"\r\n\r\n    \"2 _September._\r\n\r\n    \"What you tell me, madame, of your health alarms and saddens\r\n    me; however, I reassure myself by thinking of your youth and\r\n    remembering that, although you are very delicate, you are\r\n    full of life.\r\n\r\n    \"I am disconsolate at your being in a country which you do\r\n    not like. I would wish to see you surrounded with objects\r\n    calculated to distract and to cheer you. I hope that, when\r\n    your health recovers, you will become reconciled to Auvergne:\r\n    there is no spot incapable of presenting some beauty to such\r\n    eyes as yours. I am now living at Rennes: my loneliness suits\r\n    me fairly well. I change my residence frequently, madame, as\r\n    you see; it looks much as though I were out of place on the\r\n    earth: in reality, it is long since I first began to look\r\n    upon myself as one of its superfluous products. I believe,\r\n    madame, that I spoke to you of my sorrows and perturbations.\r\n    At present, all that is over, and I enjoy an inward peace of\r\n    which none has it any longer in his power to rob me. In spite\r\n    of my age, having, through circumstances and taste, almost\r\n    constantly led a solitary life, I knew nothing whatever,\r\n    madame, of the world: I have at last made that disagreeable\r\n    acquaintance. Fortunately, reflection came to my aid. I asked\r\n    myself in what way that world could be so formidable and\r\n    where lay the worth of a world which can never, in evil and\r\n    good alike, be aught but an object of pity. Is it not true,\r\n    madame, that man's judgment is as shallow as the rest of his\r\n    being, as changeable and of an incredulity as great as its\r\n    ignorance? All these reasons, good or bad, have enabled me\r\n    to fling behind me with ease the fantastic garment in which\r\n    I had arrayed myself. I found myself full of sincerity and\r\n    strength; I am no longer capable of being troubled. I am\r\n    working with all my might to recover possession of my life,\r\n    to obtain entire control of it.\r\n\r\n    \"You must also, madame, believe that I am not too much to\r\n    be pitied, since my brother, the best part of myself, is\r\n    agreeably placed, and since I have eyes left with which to\r\n    admire the marvels of nature, God for my support, and for an\r\n    asylum a heart full of peace and gentle memories. If you have\r\n    the kindness, madame, to continue to write to me, that will\r\n    be a great added happiness to me.\"\r\n\r\n*\r\n\r\nMystery of style, a mystery everywhere perceptible, nowhere present;\r\nthe revelation of a painfully privileged nature; the ingenuousness of\r\na girl whom one might imagine to be in her first youth; and the humble\r\nsimplicity of a genius unaware of its own power, all breathe out of\r\nthese letters, a large number of which I have suppressed. Did Madame\r\nde Sévigné write to Madame de Grignan with a more grateful affection\r\nthan Madame de Caud to Madame de Beaumont? \"Her tenderness might well\r\npretend to keep pace with her own.\" My sister loved my friend with all\r\nthe passion of the tomb, for she felt that she was going to die. Lucile\r\nhad hardly ever left the neighbourhood of the Rochers[556]; but she was\r\nthe daughter of her century and the Sévigné of solitude.\r\n\r\n*\r\n\r\nA letter from M. Ballanche, dated 30 Fructidor, informed me of the\r\narrival of Madame de Beaumont, who had come from Mont Dore on her\r\nway to Italy. He told me that I need not fear the misfortune which I\r\ndreaded, and that the health of the sufferer seemed to be improving. On\r\nreaching Milan, Madame de Beaumont met M. Bertin, who had been called\r\nthere on business: he had the kindness to take charge of the poor\r\ntraveller and to escort her to Florence, where I had gone to meet her.\r\nI was shocked at the sight of her. She had but sufficient strength left\r\nto smile. After a few days' rest, we left for Rome, travelling at a\r\nfoot-pace, in order to avoid the jolting. Madame de Beaumont received\r\nassiduous attentions everywhere: a charm interested you in this lovable\r\nwoman, so suffering and so forlorn. The very maids at the inns gave way\r\nto this sweet commiseration.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Mournful days.]\r\n\r\nMy feelings may be easily guessed: we have all accompanied friends to\r\nthe grave, but they were mute, and no remnant of inexplicable hope came\r\nto render your sorrow more keen. I no longer saw the fine landscape\r\nthrough which we passed. I had taken the Perugian road: what was Italy\r\nto me? I still thought her climate too severe, and, if the wind blew\r\never so little, its breezes seemed storms to me. At Terni, Madame de\r\nBeaumont spoke of going to see the cascade; she made an effort to lean\r\non my arm, and sat down again, saying:\r\n\r\n\"We must leave the waters to flow without us.\"\r\n\r\nI had hired for her in Rome a lonely house near the Piazza d'Espagna,\r\nat the foot of the Monte Pincio[557]; it had a little garden with\r\norange-trees growing against the walls, and a court-yard in which stood\r\na fig-tree. There I set down my dying charge. I had had much difficulty\r\nin procuring this retreat, for there is a prejudice in Rome against\r\ndiseases of the chest, which are considered as infectious.\r\n\r\nAt that period of the revival of social order, all that had belonged\r\nto the old monarchy was sought after. The Pope sent to inquire after\r\nthe daughter of M. de Montmorin; Cardinal Consalvi and the members\r\nof the Sacred College followed His Holiness' example; Cardinal Fesch\r\nhimself showed Madame de Beaumont, to the day of her death, marks of\r\ndeference and respect which I should not have expected of him. I had\r\nwritten to M. Joubert of the anxiety with which I was torn before\r\nMadame de Beaumont's arrival:\r\n\r\n    \"Our friend writes to me from Mont Dore,\" I said, \"letters\r\n    that shatter my soul: she says that she feels 'that there\r\n    is no more oil in the lamp;' she speaks of 'the last throbs\r\n    of her heart.' Why was she left alone on this journey? Why\r\n    did you not write to her? What will become of us if we lose\r\n    her? Who will console us for her? We realize the value of our\r\n    friends only at the moment when we are threatened with their\r\n    loss. We are even mad enough, when all is well, to think\r\n    that we can leave them with impunity. Heaven punishes us; it\r\n    snatches them from us, and we are appalled at the solitude\r\n    which they leave around us. Forgive me, my dear Joubert:\r\n    to-day I feel as though my heart were twenty years old; this\r\n    Italy has made me young again; I love all that is dear to\r\n    me with the same vehemence as in my early years. Sorrow is\r\n    my element: I am myself again only when I am unhappy. My\r\n    friends at present are of so rare a sort that the mere dread\r\n    of seeing them taken from me freezes my blood. Bear with my\r\n    lamentations: I am sure you are as unhappy as I. Write to me,\r\n    and write also to that other Breton unfortunate.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nAt first, Madame de Beaumont felt a little relieved. The sufferer\r\nherself began again to believe in her life. I had the satisfaction\r\nof thinking that at least Madame de Beaumont would not leave me\r\nagain: I expected to take her to Naples in the spring, and from there\r\nto send in my resignation to the Minister for Foreign Affairs. M.\r\nd'Agincourt[558], that true philosopher, came to see the light bird\r\nof passage, which had stopped at Rome before proceeding to the unknown\r\nland; M. Boquet, already the oldest of our painters, called. These\r\nrelays of hope kept up the sufferer, and lulled her with an illusion\r\nwhich at the bottom of her soul she no longer retained. Letters, cruel\r\nto read, expressing hopes and fears, reached me from every side. On the\r\n4th of October, Lucile wrote to me from Rennes:\r\n\r\n*\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Letters from Lucile.]\r\n\r\n    \"I commenced a letter for you the other day; I have just made\r\n    a useless search for it; in it I spoke to you of Madame de\r\n    Beaumont, and complained of her silence towards me. Dear,\r\n    what a sad, strange life I have led for some months! And the\r\n    words of the prophet are constantly recurring to my mind: 'He\r\n    will crown thee with tribulation, he will toss thee like a\r\n    ball[559].' But let us leave my troubles and speak of your\r\n    anxieties. I cannot persuade myself that they are justified.\r\n    I always see Madame de Beaumont full of life and youth, and\r\n    almost incorporeal; my heart can feel no foreboding where\r\n    she is concerned. Heaven, which knows our feelings for her,\r\n    will doubtless preserve her for us. Dear, we shall not lose\r\n    her; I seem to have an inward sense that that is certain.\r\n    I sincerely hope that, when you receive this letter, your\r\n    anxiety will have disappeared. Tell her from me of all the\r\n    real and tender interest I take in her; tell her that to\r\n    me her memory is one of the most beautiful things in this\r\n    world. Keep your promise and do not fail to let me have news\r\n    of her as often as possible. Alas, what a long time will\r\n    elapse before I receive a reply to this letter! How cruel a\r\n    thing is distance! What makes you speak of your return to\r\n    France? You are trying to humour me, you are deceiving me.\r\n    Amid all my troubles there arises one sweet thought, that of\r\n    your friendship, the thought that I exist in your memory in\r\n    the shape in which it has pleased God to fashion me. Dear, I\r\n    see no other safe shelter for me upon earth but your heart;\r\n    I am a stranger and unknown to all the rest. Adieu, my poor\r\n    brother. Shall I see you again? This idea does not present\r\n    itself to my mind very distinctly. If you see me again, I\r\n    fear you will find me quite out of my senses. Adieu, you to\r\n    whom I owe so much! Adieu, unmixed felicity! O memories of my\r\n    happy days, can you not now lighten a little my sad hours?\r\n\r\n    \"I am not one of those who exhaust all their sorrow at the\r\n    moment of separation; each day adds to the grief which I feel\r\n    at your absence and, if you were to stay in Rome a hundred\r\n    years, you would not come to the end of that grief. In order\r\n    to delude myself as to absence, not a day passes but I read\r\n    some pages of your work: I make every effort to imagine that\r\n    I hear you speak. My love for you is very natural: ever since\r\n    our childhood you have been my protector and my friend; you\r\n    have never cost me a tear, never made a friend but he has\r\n    become mine. My kind brother, Heaven, which is pleased to\r\n    make sport of all my other felicities, wills that I should\r\n    find my happiness wholly in you, that I should trust myself\r\n    to your heart. Give me news soon of Madame de Beaumont.\r\n    Address your letters to me at Mademoiselle Lamotte's,\r\n    although I do not know how long I shall be able to remain\r\n    there. Since our last separation, I have always, where my\r\n    house is concerned, been like a quicksand that gives way\r\n    beneath my feet: assuredly to anyone who does not know me I\r\n    must appear incomprehensible; nevertheless I vary only in\r\n    form, for inwardly I remain constantly the same.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nThe song of the swan preparing to die was conveyed by me to the dying\r\nswan: I was the echo of that last ineffable music!\r\n\r\n*\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: And Madame de Krüdener.]\r\n\r\nAnother letter, very different from the above, but written by a woman\r\nwho has played an extraordinary part, Madame de Krüdener[560], shows\r\nthe empire which Madame de Beaumont, with no strength of beauty, fame,\r\npower, or wealth, exercised over people's minds:\r\n\r\n    \"PARIS, 24 _November_ 1803.\r\n\r\n    \"I learnt two days ago from M. Michaud[561], who has returned\r\n    from Lyons, that Madame de Beaumont was in Rome and that she\r\n    was very, very ill: that is what he told me. I was deeply\r\n    grieved by this; I had a nervous shock, and I thought a great\r\n    deal of this charming woman, whom I had not known long,\r\n    but whom I loved truly. How often have I wished for her\r\n    happiness! How often have I hoped that she might cross the\r\n    Alps and find beneath the sky of Italy the sweet and profound\r\n    emotions which I myself have there experienced! Alas, can\r\n    she have reached that delightful country only to know pain\r\n    and to be exposed to dangers which I dread! I cannot tell\r\n    you how this idea grieves me. Forgive me if I have been so\r\n    much absorbed by this that I have not yet spoken to you of\r\n    yourself, my dear Chateaubriand; you must know my sincere\r\n    attachment for you, and to show you the genuine interest\r\n    which I take in Madame de Beaumont is to touch you more than\r\n    I should have done by writing of yourself. I have that sad\r\n    spectacle before my eyes; I have the secret of sorrow, and\r\n    my soul is always torn at the sight of those souls to which\r\n    nature gives the power of suffering more than others. I had\r\n    hoped that Madame de Beaumont would enjoy the privilege which\r\n    she had received, of being happier; I had hoped that she\r\n    would recover some little health with the sun of Italy and\r\n    the happiness of having you by her side. Ah, reassure me,\r\n    speak to me; tell her that I love her sincerely, that I pray\r\n    for her! Has she had my letter written in reply to hers to\r\n    Clermont? Address your answer to Michaud: I ask you only for\r\n    one word, for I know, my dear Chateaubriand, how sensitive\r\n    you are, and how you suffer. I thought she was better; I did\r\n    not write to her; I was overwhelmed with business; but I\r\n    thought of the happiness she would find in seeing you again,\r\n    and I imagined how it would be. Tell me something of your own\r\n    health; believe in my friendship, in the interest which I\r\n    have vowed to you for ever, and do not forget me.\r\n\r\n    \"B. KRÜDENER.\"\r\n\r\nThe improvement which the air of Rome had produced in Madame\r\nde Beaumont did not last: true, the indications of an immediate\r\ndissolution disappeared; but it seems that the last moment always\r\nlingers as it were to deceive us. Two or three times, I had tried the\r\neffect of a drive with the patient; I strove to divert her thoughts\r\nby pointing out the country and the sky to her: she no longer cared\r\nfor anything. One day I took her to the Coliseum: it was one of those\r\nOctober days that are to be seen only in Rome. She contrived to alight,\r\nand went and sat upon a stone facing one of the altars placed in\r\nthe circle. She raised her eyes and turned them slowly around those\r\nporticoes which had themselves so many years been dead, and which had\r\nseen so many die; the ruins were adorned with briers and columbines\r\nsaffroned by autumn and bathed in light. The dying woman next lowered\r\nher eyes, which had left the sun, stage by stage, till they came to the\r\narena; she fixed them upon the altar cross, and said:\r\n\r\n\"Let us go; I am cold.\"\r\n\r\nI took her home again; she went to bed and rose no more. I was in\r\ncorrespondence with the Comte de La Luzerne[562]; I sent him from Rome,\r\nby each mail, the bulletin of his sister-in-law's health. He had taken\r\nmy brother with him when Louis XVI. charged him with a diplomatic\r\nmission to London: André Chénier was a member of this embassy.\r\n\r\nThe doctors, whom I called together again after the experiment of the\r\ndrive, declared to me that nothing but a miracle could save Madame de\r\nBeaumont. She was impressed with the idea that she would not outlive\r\nAll Souls' Day, the 2nd of November; then she remembered that one of\r\nher kinsmen, I do not know which, had died on the 4th of November. I\r\ntold her that her imagination was troubled; that she would come to see\r\nthe falsity of her alarms; she replied, to console me:\r\n\r\n\"Ah, yes, I shall go farther!\"\r\n\r\nShe noticed a few tears which I was trying to conceal from her; she\r\nheld out her hand to me, and said:\r\n\r\n\"You are a child; were you not prepared for it?\"\r\n\r\nOn the eve of her death, Thursday the 3rd of November, she seemed more\r\ncomposed. She spoke to me of the disposal of her property, and said,\r\nspeaking of her will, \"that all was settled, but that all had to be\r\ndone, and that she would have liked to have had only two hours in which\r\nto see to it.\"\r\n\r\nIn the evening, the doctor told me that he felt obliged to warn the\r\nsufferer that the time had come for her to think of setting her\r\nconscience in order: I broke down for a minute; I was staggered by the\r\nfear of hastening the few moments which Madame de Beaumont had still to\r\nlive by the formal preparations for death. I railed at the doctor, and\r\nthen entreated him to wait at least till the next day.\r\n\r\nI passed a cruel night, with this secret locked in my bosom. The\r\npatient did not permit me to spend it in her room. I remained outside,\r\ntrembling at every sound I heard: when the door was half opened, I\r\nperceived the feeble gleam of an expiring night-light.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The last scene.]\r\n\r\nOn Friday the 4th of November, I entered, followed by the doctor.\r\nMadame de Beaumont observed my agitation, and said:\r\n\r\n\"Why do you look like that? I have had a good night.\"\r\n\r\nThe doctor thereupon intentionally told me aloud that he wished to\r\nspeak to me in the next room. I went out: when I returned, I no longer\r\nknew if I lived. Madame de Beaumont asked me what the doctor wanted. I\r\nflung myself at her bedside and burst into tears. She lay for a moment\r\nwithout speaking, looked at me, and said in a firm voice, as though she\r\nwished to give me strength:\r\n\r\n\"I did not think that it was quite so near; well, the time has come to\r\nsay good-bye. Send for the Abbé de Bonnevie.\"\r\n\r\nThe Abbé de Bonnevie, having obtained powers, went to Madame de\r\nBeaumont. She told him that she had always had a deep religious feeling\r\nat heart, but that the extraordinary misfortunes which had befallen\r\nher during the Revolution had led her for some time to doubt the\r\njustice of Providence; that she was ready to admit her errors and to\r\nrecommend herself to the eternal mercy; that she hoped, however, that\r\nthe ills which she had suffered in this world would shorten her time of\r\nexpiation in the next. She made a sign to me to withdraw, and remained\r\nalone with her confessor.\r\n\r\nI saw him come back an hour later, wiping his eyes, and saying that he\r\nhad never heard more beautiful language, nor seen such heroism. The\r\nparish priest was sent for to administer the sacraments. I returned to\r\nMadame de Beaumont. When she saw me, she asked:\r\n\r\n\"Well, are you pleased with me?\"\r\n\r\nShe spoke feelingly of what she deigned to call \"my kindness\" to her:\r\nah, if I had at that moment been able to buy back a single one of her\r\ndays by the sacrifice of all my own, how gladly would I have done\r\nso! Madame de Beaumont's other friends, who were not present at this\r\nsight, had at all events but once to weep for her: whereas I stood at\r\nthe head of the bed of pain in which man hears his last hour strike,\r\nand each smile of the patient restored me to life and made me lose it\r\nagain as it died away. One lamentable thought distracted me: I noticed\r\nthat Madame de Beaumont had not until her last breath suspected the\r\nreal attachment which I bore for her; she did not cease to show her\r\nsurprise, and she seemed to die disconsolate and charmed. She had\r\nbelieved herself a burden to me, and had wished to go to set me free.\r\n\r\nThe priest arrived at eleven o'clock: the room filled with that\r\nindifferent crowd of idlers which cannot be prevented from running\r\nafter the priest in Rome. Madame de Beaumont faced the formidable\r\nsolemnity without the least sign of fear. We fell upon our knees, and\r\nthe patient received Communion and Extreme Unction at once. When all\r\nhad retired, she made me sit on the edge of her bed and spoke to me for\r\nhalf an hour of my affairs and of my plans with the greatest elevation\r\nof mind and the most touching friendship; she urged me, above all, to\r\nlive with Madame de Chateaubriand and M. Joubert: but was M. Joubert\r\nhimself to live?\r\n\r\nShe asked me to open the window, as she felt oppressed. A sun-ray came\r\nand lit up her bed: this seemed to cheer her. She then reminded me of\r\nplans for retiring to the country which we had sometimes discussed, and\r\nshe began to cry.\r\n\r\nBetween two and three in the afternoon, Madame de Beaumont asked to be\r\nchanged to another bed by Madame Saint-Germain[563], an old Spanish\r\nlady's-maid, who waited on her with the affection worthy of so kind\r\na mistress: the doctor forbade this, fearing lest Madame de Beaumont\r\nmight die during the moving. She then told me that she felt the agony\r\napproach. Suddenly she flung back her blanket, held out her hand to me,\r\npressed mine convulsively; her eyes wandered. With her one free hand\r\nshe made signs to some one whom she saw standing at the foot of her\r\nbed; then, bringing the hand back to her breast, she said:\r\n\r\n\"It is there!\"\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Death of madame de Beaumont.]\r\n\r\nDismayed, I asked her if she knew me: a faint smile broke through her\r\ndelirium; she gave me a little nod of the head: her speech already was\r\nno longer of this world. The convulsions lasted only a few minutes. We\r\nsupported her in our arms, the doctor, the nurse, and myself: one of my\r\nhands lay upon her heart, which could be felt against her wasted frame;\r\nit beat swiftly, like a clock winding off its broken chain. Oh, moment\r\nof fear and horror, I felt it stop! We let down upon her pillow the\r\nwoman who had found rest; her head drooped. Some locks of her uncurled\r\nhair fell over her forehead; her eyes were closed, night had set in for\r\never. The doctor held a mirror and a light to the stranger's mouth: the\r\nmirror was not dimmed with the breath of life and the light remained\r\nunmoved. All was ended.\r\n\r\n*\r\n\r\nGenerally those who weep are able to indulge their tears in peace;\r\nthere are others to take upon themselves to attend to the last cares\r\nof religion: as representing for France the Cardinal Minister, then\r\nabsent, and as the sole friend of M. de Montmorin's daughter and\r\nresponsible to her family, I was obliged to superintend everything; I\r\nhad to fix the place of burial, to look after the depth and width of\r\nthe grave, to order the winding-sheet and to give the carpenter the\r\ndimensions of the coffin.\r\n\r\nTwo monks watched by the coffin, which was to be carried to San Luigi\r\ndei Francesi. One of these fathers was from Auvergne and a native of\r\nMontmorin itself. Madame de Beaumont had expressed the wish to be\r\nburied in a piece of cloth which her brother Auguste[564], the only\r\none to escape the scaffold, had sent her from the Mauritius. This\r\ncloth was not in Rome; only a piece of it was found, which she always\r\ncarried with her. Madame Saint-Germain fastened this strip around the\r\nbody with a cornelian containing some of M. de Montmorin's hair. The\r\nFrench ecclesiastics were invited; the Princesse Borghèse lent the\r\nfuneral car of her family; Cardinal Fesch had left orders, in case\r\nof an accident but too clearly foreseen, to send his livery and his\r\ncarriages. On Saturday the 5th of November, at seven o'clock in the\r\nevening, by the gleam of torch-light and amidst a large crowd, Madame\r\nde Beaumont passed along the road where we have all to pass. On Sunday\r\nthe 6th of November, the burial mass was celebrated. The funeral would\r\nhave been less French in Paris than it was in Rome. That religious\r\narchitecture which displays in its ornaments the arms and inscriptions\r\nof our ancient country; those tombs on which are inscribed the names of\r\nsome of the most historic families of our annals; that church, under\r\nthe protection of a great saint, a great king and a great man: all this\r\ndid not console misfortune, but honoured it. I had wished that the last\r\nscion of a once exalted race should at least find some support in my\r\nhumble attachment, and that friendship should not fail it as fortune\r\nhad done.\r\n\r\nThe people of Rome, accustomed to strangers, accept them as brothers\r\nand sisters. Madame de Beaumont left a pious memory behind her on\r\nthat soil so hospitable to the dead; she is still remembered: I have\r\nseen Leo XII.[565] pray at her tomb[566]. In 1828[567], I visited the\r\nmonument of her who was the soul of a vanishing society; the sound of\r\nmy footsteps around this silent monument, in a lonely church, was a\r\nwarning to me:\r\n\r\n\"I shall always love thee,\" says the Greek epitaph; \"but thou, among\r\nthe dead, drink not, I pray thee, of the cup which would cause thee to\r\nforget thy former friends[568].\"\r\n\r\nIf the calamities of a private life were to be measured by the scale\r\nof public events, those calamities would hardly deserve a word in a\r\nwriter's Memoirs. Who has not lost a friend? Who has not seen him die?\r\nWho could not recall a similar scene of mourning? The comment is just,\r\nyet no one has ever corrected himself of telling his own adventures:\r\nsailors on board the ship that carries them have a family on shore of\r\nwhom they think and of whom they talk with one another. Every man has\r\nwithin himself a world apart, foreign to the laws and to the general\r\ndestinies of the ages. It is, moreover, a mistake to believe that\r\nrevolutions, famous accidents, resounding catastrophes are the only\r\nrecords of our nature: we all labour singly at the chain of our common\r\nhistory, and all these separate existences together compose man's\r\nuniverse in the eyes of God.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Letters of sympathy.]\r\n\r\nTo collect regrets around the ashes of Madame de Beaumont is but to lay\r\nupon her tomb the wreaths intended for her:\r\n\r\n    M. DE CHÊNEDOLLÉ TO CHATEAUBRIAND.\r\n\r\n    \"You can have no doubt, my dear', unhappy friend, of the\r\n    great part which I take in your affliction. My grief is not\r\n    so great as yours, because that is impossible; but I am very\r\n    deeply afflicted by this loss, which darkens yet further this\r\n    existence which for so long has been nothing but suffering to\r\n    me. It is thus that all that is good, lovable and sensitive\r\n    vanishes from the face of the earth. My poor friend, hasten\r\n    back to France; come and seek consolation with your old\r\n    friend. You know how well I love you: come.\r\n\r\n    \"I was excessively anxious about you: it was more than three\r\n    months since I had heard from you, and three of my letters\r\n    have remained unanswered. Have you received them? Madame de\r\n    Caud suddenly ceased writing to me two months ago. This hurt\r\n    me mortally, and yet I cannot think that I have done anything\r\n    to offend her. But, whatever she may do, she can never take\r\n    from me the fond and respectful friendship which I have vowed\r\n    to her for life. Fontanes and Joubert also no longer write to\r\n    me; so that all whom I loved seem to have combined to forget\r\n    me at once. Do not you forget me, O my good friend: leave\r\n    me one heart upon which I can rely in this vale of tears!\r\n    Farewell, I embrace you weeping. Be sure, my good friend,\r\n    that I feel your loss as it should be felt.\r\n\r\n    \"23 _November_ 1803.\"\r\n\r\n    M. DE FONTANES TO CHATEAUBRIAND.\r\n\r\n    \"I share all your regrets, my dear friend: I feel the\r\n    painfulness of your position. To die so young, and after\r\n    outliving all her family! But, at any rate, that interesting\r\n    and unhappy woman did not lack the help and the remembrance\r\n    of friendship. Her memory will live in hearts worthy of her.\r\n    I have forwarded to M. de La Luzerne the touching account\r\n    intended for him. Old Saint-Germain, your friend's servant,\r\n    has taken it with him. That faithful attendant made me shed\r\n    tears when talking of his mistress. I told him that he\r\n    had a legacy of ten thousand francs; but he did not give\r\n    it a single thought. If it were possible to talk of money\r\n    matters under such mournful circumstances, I would say that\r\n    it would have been very natural to have given you at least\r\n    the use of a fortune which will have to pass to distant and\r\n    almost unknown collaterals[569]. I approve of your conduct;\r\n    I know your delicacy; but I cannot be as disinterested for\r\n    my friend as he is for himself. I confess that this omission\r\n    surprises and pains me[570]. Madame de Beaumont spoke to you\r\n    on her death-bed, with the eloquence of a last farewell,\r\n    of the future and of your destinies. Her voice must needs\r\n    have greater strength than mine. But did she advise you to\r\n    throw up a salary of eight or ten thousand francs just when\r\n    your path was cleared of its first thorns? Could you rashly,\r\n    my dear friend, take so momentous a step? You know what a\r\n    pleasure it would be to me to see you again. Were I only\r\n    to consult my own happiness, I would say, 'Come at once.'\r\n    But your interests are as dear to me as my own, and I see\r\n    no immediate prospects for you which could make good the\r\n    advantages which you are voluntarily surrendering. I know\r\n    that your talents, your name and your industry will never\r\n    leave you in want of the first necessities; but in all that\r\n    I see more fame than fortune. Your education, your habits,\r\n    demand some little expenditure. Reputation alone will not\r\n    provide the wants of life, and the wretched science of 'bread\r\n    and cheese' takes precedence of all others, if you want to be\r\n    independent and at ease. I trust that nothing will persuade\r\n    you to seek your fortune among foreigners. Believe me, my\r\n    friend, after the first blandishments, they are worth even\r\n    less than one's fellow-countrymen. If your loving friend\r\n    made all these reflections, her last moments must have been\r\n    somewhat disturbed; but I hope that, at the foot of her\r\n    grave, you will find lessons and lights superior to any which\r\n    your remaining friends could give you. That amiable woman\r\n    loved you: she will advise you well. Her memory and your\r\n    heart will be a safe guide to you: I have no more concern if\r\n    you listen to them both. Adieu, my dear friend, I embrace you\r\n    tenderly.\"\r\n\r\nM. Necker wrote me the only letter which I ever received from him.\r\nI had witnessed the delight of the Court at the dismissal of this\r\nminister, the disregard of whose honest warnings contributed to the\r\noverthrow of the monarchy. He had been M. de Montmorin's colleague. M.\r\nNecker was shortly to die at the place whence his letter was dated; not\r\nat that time having Madame de Staël by his side, he found some tears\r\nfor his daughter's friend:\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: M. Necker, Madame de Staël.]\r\n\r\n    M. NECKER TO CHATEAUBRIAND.\r\n\r\n    \"SIR,\r\n\r\n    \"My daughter, when setting out for Germany, asked me to\r\n    open any packets of large size that might be addressed to\r\n    her, so as to decide whether they were worth the trouble\r\n    of forwarding by post. This is the reason of my learning\r\n    the news of Madame de Beaumont's death before she does. I\r\n    forwarded your letter to her, sir, at Frankfort, whence it\r\n    will probably be sent on farther to her, perhaps to Weimar or\r\n    Berlin. Do not, therefore, be surprised, sir, if you do not\r\n    receive a reply from Madame de Staël as early as you have the\r\n    right to expect. You must be assured, sir, of the grief which\r\n    Madame de Staël will feel on hearing of the loss of a friend\r\n    of whom I have always heard her speak with profound feeling.\r\n    I join in her sorrow, I join, sir, in yours, and I have my\r\n    own particular share when I think of the unhappy fate of the\r\n    whole family of my friend M. de Montmorin.\r\n\r\n    \"I see, sir, that you are on the point of leaving Rome to\r\n    return to France: I hope you will choose your road through\r\n    Geneva, where I shall spend the winter. I should be very\r\n    eager to do you the honours of a town where you are already\r\n    known by reputation. But where, sir, are you not so known?\r\n    Your last work, sparkling with incomparable beauties, is in\r\n    the hands of all who love to read.\r\n\r\n    \"I have the honour, sir, to offer you the assurance and the\r\n    homage of my most distinguished sentiments.\r\n\r\n    \"NECKER.\r\n\r\n    \"Coppet, 27 _November_ 1803.\"\r\n\r\n    MADAME DE STAËL TO CHATEAUBRIAND.\r\n\r\n    \"FRANKFORT, 3 _December_ 1803.\r\n\r\n    \"Ah, Heavens, my dear Francis[571] with what sorrow was I\r\n    smitten on receiving your letter! Already, yesterday, this\r\n    frightful news was burst upon me through the papers, and now\r\n    comes your heart-rending narrative to engrave it for ever in\r\n    letters of blood on my heart. Can you, can you speak to me of\r\n    different opinions on religion, on the priests? Are there two\r\n    opinions where there is but one sentiment? I have read your\r\n    account through the most sorrowful tears. My dear Francis,\r\n    think of the time at which you felt the greatest friendship\r\n    for me; above all, do not forget that at which my whole heart\r\n    was drawn towards you, and tell yourself that those feelings,\r\n    more tender, more profound than ever, remain for you at the\r\n    bottom of my soul. I loved, I admired the character of Madame\r\n    de Beaumont: I knew not one more generous, more grateful,\r\n    more passionately sensitive. Since I first entered into\r\n    the world, I never ceased to have relations with her, and\r\n    I always felt, even in the midst of some differences, that\r\n    we held together by the same roots. My dear Francis, give\r\n    me a place in your heart. I admire you, I love you, I loved\r\n    her whom you regret. I am a devoted friend, I will be a\r\n    sister to you. I must respect your opinions more than ever.\r\n    Matthieu[572], who holds them, has been an angel to me in\r\n    this last sorrow which I have felt. Give me a new reason for\r\n    showing them my consideration: let me be useful or agreeable\r\n    to you in some way. Did you hear that I had been banished to\r\n    a distance of forty leagues from Paris[573]? I have taken\r\n    the occasion to go round Germany; but in the spring I shall\r\n    have returned to Paris itself, if my exile be ended, or near\r\n    Paris, or to Geneva. Arrange that, in some manner, we may\r\n    meet. Do you not feel that my mind and my soul understand\r\n    yours, and do you not feel wherein we resemble each other,\r\n    notwithstanding the differences? M. de Humboldt[574] wrote me\r\n    a letter a few days ago in which he spoke to me of your work\r\n    with an admiration which must flatter you in a man of his\r\n    merit and opinions. But why speak to you of your successes at\r\n    such a moment? Yet she loved those successes of yours, and\r\n    attached her own fame to them. Farewell, my dear François. I\r\n    will write to you from Weimar, in Saxony. Write to me there,\r\n    to the care of Messrs. Desport, bankers. What harrowing\r\n    phrases your story contains! And then your resolve to keep\r\n    poor Saint-Germain: you must bring her to my house one day.\r\n\r\n    \"Farewell, affectionately: and sorrowfully, farewell.\r\n\r\n    \"M. DE STAËL.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nThis eager and affectionately informal letter, written by an\r\nillustrious woman, redoubled my emotion. Madame de Beaumont would have\r\nbeen very happy at that moment had Heaven permitted her to return to\r\nlife! But our attachments, which are perceived by the dead, cannot free\r\nthem from their bonds: when Lazarus rose from the tomb he was bound\r\nfeet and hands with winding-bands, and his face was bound about with a\r\nnapkin; but friendship cannot say, as Christ said to Martha and Mary:\r\n\r\n\"Loose him and let him go[575].\"\r\n\r\nMy consolers have also passed away, and they claim for themselves the\r\nregrets which they gave to another.\r\n\r\n*\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: My grief.]\r\n\r\nI had determined to leave this official career in which personal\r\nmisfortunes had come in addition to the triviality of the work and to\r\npaltry political annoyances. One does not know what desolation of the\r\nheart means until one has remained alone, wandering through spots once\r\ninhabited by a person who accepted your life: you seek her and do not\r\nfind her; she speaks to you, smiles to you, accompanies you; all that\r\nshe has worn or touched presents her image; between her and you there\r\nis only a transparent curtain, but so heavy that you cannot raise it.\r\nThe remembrance of the first friend who has left you on the road is a\r\ncruel one; for if your days have been prolonged, you have necessarily\r\nsuffered other losses: the dead who have followed each other become\r\nlinked to the first, and you mourn at one time and in one person all\r\nthose whom you have successively lost.\r\n\r\nAt this distance from France, the arrangements which I was making\r\nprogressed slowly; meanwhile I remained forlorn among the ruins of\r\nRome. When I first walked out, the aspect of things seemed changed to\r\nme: I did not recognise the trees, nor the monuments, nor the sky; I\r\nwandered through the fields, along the cascades and aqueducts, as I\r\nhad done before beneath the overhanging forests of the New World. Then\r\nI re-entered the Eternal City, which now added one more extinguished\r\nlife to so many spent existences. By dint of my many rambles in the\r\nsolitudes of the Tiber, they became so clearly engraved upon my memory\r\nthat I was able to describe them fairly accurately in my Letter to M.\r\nde Fontanes[576]:\r\n\r\n    \"If the traveller be unhappy,\" I said, \"if he have\r\n    mingled the ashes that he loved with so many ashes of the\r\n    illustrious, what a charm will he not find in passing from\r\n    the tomb of Cæcilia Metella to the grave of an ill-fortuned\r\n    woman!\"\r\n\r\n\r\nIt was also in Rome that I first formed the idea of writing the Memoirs\r\nof my Life; I find a few lines jotted down at random, from which I\r\ndecipher these few words:\r\n\r\n    \"After wandering over the world, spending the best years of\r\n    my youth far from my native land, and suffering nearly all\r\n    that man can suffer, not excluding hunger, I returned to\r\n    Paris in 1800.\"\r\n\r\nIn a letter to M. Joubert[577] I thus sketched my plan:\r\n\r\n    \"My only pleasure is to snatch a few hours wherein to busy\r\n    myself with a work which alone can bring some assuagement\r\n    to my grief: it is the Memoirs of my Life. Rome will have a\r\n    place in it; it is in this way only that I can henceforth\r\n    speak of Rome. Have no fear; there will be no confessions\r\n    likely to give pain to my friends: if I am to count for\r\n    anything in the future, my friends' names will therein appear\r\n    glorified and respected. Nor shall I entertain posterity\r\n    with the details of my frailties; I shall say of myself only\r\n    what becomes my dignity as a man, and, I dare say it, the\r\n    elevation of my heart. One should show to the world only what\r\n    is beautiful; it is no lie against God to unveil of one's\r\n    life no more than may lead our fellows towards noble and\r\n    generous feelings. Not that, in truth, I have anything to\r\n    conceal: I have not caused the dismissal of a servant-girl\r\n    for a stolen ribbon, nor left my friend to die in the street,\r\n    nor dishonoured the woman who sheltered me, nor taken my\r\n    bastards to the Foundling Hospital[578]; but I have had my\r\n    moments of weakness, of faint-heartedness: one sigh over\r\n    myself will be sufficient to make others understand those\r\n    common miseries, meant to be left behind the veil. What would\r\n    society gain by the reproduction of sores that occur on every\r\n    side? There is no lack of examples, where it is a question of\r\n    triumphing over our poor human nature.\"\r\n\r\n*\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: I decide to write my memoirs.]\r\n\r\nIn this plan which I made for myself I omitted my family, my childhood,\r\nmy youth, my travels, and my exile: yet these are the recitals in which\r\nI took most pleasure.\r\n\r\nI had been like a happy slave: accustomed to apply his liberty to the\r\nvine-stocks, he no longer knows what to do with his leisure when his\r\nchains are broken. Whenever I decided to set to work, a figure came and\r\nplaced itself before me, and I could not take my eyes from it: religion\r\nalone held me by its gravity and by the reflections of a higher order\r\nwhich it suggested to me.\r\n\r\nAnd yet, while occupied with the thought of writing my Memoirs, I felt\r\nthe price which the ancients attached to the value of their name: there\r\nis perhaps a touching reality in this perpetuity of the memories which\r\none may leave on the way. Perhaps, among the great men of antiquity,\r\nthis idea of an immortal life among the human race supplied the place\r\nof the immortality of the soul which for them remained a problem.\r\nIf fame is but a small thing when it relates to ourselves, it must\r\nnevertheless be agreed that to give an imperishable existence to all\r\nthat it has loved is one of the finest privileges attached to the\r\nfriendship of genius.\r\n\r\nI undertook a commentary upon certain books of the Bible, beginning\r\nwith _Genesis._ Upon the verse, \"Behold, Adam is become as one of\r\nus, knowing good and evil: now, therefore, lest perhaps he put forth\r\nhis hand, and take also of the tree of life, and eat, and live for\r\never[579],\" I remarked the tremendous irony of the Creator: \"Behold\r\nAdam is become as one of us, etc. Lest perhaps the man put forth his\r\nhand and take of the tree of life.\" Why? Because he has tasted of the\r\nfruit of knowledge, and knows good and evil, he is now loaded with\r\nills: \"therefore, lest perhaps he live for ever.\" What a blessing from\r\nGod is death!\r\n\r\nThere are prayers begun, some for \"disquietude of soul,\" others \"to\r\nstrengthen one's self against the prosperity of the wicked.\" I sought\r\nto bring back to a centre of repose the thoughts which strayed beyond\r\nme.\r\n\r\nAs God was not pleased to let my life end there, reserving it for\r\nprolonged trials, the storms which had arisen abated. Suddenly the\r\nCardinal Ambassador changed his manner towards me; I had an explanation\r\nwith him, and declared my resolve to resign. He opposed this: he\r\nmaintained that my resignation at that moment would have the appearance\r\nof a disgrace; that I should be delighting my enemies, that the First\r\nConsul would take offense, which would prevent me from remaining\r\nundisturbed in the places to which I proposed to retire. He suggested\r\nthat I should go to spend a fortnight or a month at Naples.\r\n\r\nJust at this moment, I was being sounded on behalf of Russia with a\r\nview to my accepting the place of governor to a grand-duke: it was as\r\nmuch as I would have done had I proposed to sacrifice to Henry V. the\r\nlast years of my life.\r\n\r\nWhile wavering between a thousand resolutions, I received the news\r\nthat the First Consul had appointed me Minister to the Valais. He had\r\nat first flown into a passion on the faith of some denunciations; but,\r\nreturning to his senses, he understood that I was of the race which\r\nis of value only in the front rank, that I should not be mixed with\r\nothers, as otherwise I could never be used to advantage. There was no\r\nplace vacant: he created one, and, choosing it in conformity with my\r\ninstinct for solitude and independence, he placed me in the Alps; he\r\ngave me a Catholic republic, in a world of torrents: the Rhone and our\r\nsoldiers would cross at my feet, the one descending towards France,\r\nthe others climbing towards Italy, while the Simplon opened its daring\r\nroad before me. The Consul was to allow me as frequent leave as I might\r\nwish to travel in Italy, and Madame Bacciochi sent me a message through\r\nFontanes that the first important embassy available was reserved for\r\nme. I thus won this first diplomatic victory without either expecting\r\nor intending it; true that, at the head of the State, was a lofty\r\nintelligence, which was not willing to sacrifice to official intrigues\r\nanother intelligence which it knew to be but too well disposed to\r\nsecede from the government.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Cardinal Fesch.]\r\n\r\nThis remark is all the more true in that Cardinal Fesch, to whom I do\r\njustice in these Memoirs in a manner upon which, perhaps, he did not\r\nreckon, had sent two malicious dispatches to Paris, almost at the very\r\nmoment at which his manners had become more obliging, after the death\r\nof Madame de Beaumont. Did his true thought lie in his conversations,\r\nwhen he gave me leave to go to Naples, or in his diplomatic missives?\r\nThe conversations and the missives bear the same date and are\r\ncontradictory. It would have been easy for me to set M. le Cardinal,\r\nright with himself by destroying all traces of the reports that\r\nconcerned me: I had but to remove the Ambassador's lucubrations from\r\nthe _cartons_ at the time when I was Minister for Foreign Affairs; I\r\nshould have done only what M. de Talleyrand did in the matter of his\r\ncorrespondence with the Emperor. I did not consider that I had the\r\nright to turn my power to my own advantage. If, by chance, any one\r\nshould look up these documents, he would find them in their place. That\r\nthis conduct is self-deceiving I readily admit; but, in order not to\r\nmake a merit of a virtue which I do not possess, I must say that this\r\nrespect for the correspondence of my detractors arises more from my\r\ncontempt than from my generosity. I have also seen, in the archives\r\nof the Berlin Embassy, offensive letters from M. le Marquis de Bonnay\r\nconcerning myself: far from considering my own feelings, I shall make\r\nthem public.\r\n\r\nM. le Cardinal Fesch was no more reticent as to the poor Abbé Guillon\r\n(the Bishop of Morocco): the latter was marked out as \"a Russian\r\nagent.\" Bonaparte called M. Lainé[580] \"an English agent:\" these are\r\ninstances of the gossip of which that great man had taken the bad habit\r\nfrom the police reports. But was there nothing to be said against M.\r\nFesch himself? The Cardinal de Clermont-Tonnerre was at Rome like\r\nmyself, in 1803: what did he not write of Napoleon's uncle! I have the\r\nletters.\r\n\r\nFor the rest, to whom do these contentions, buried since forty years\r\nin worm-eaten files, matter? Of the several actors of that period, one\r\nalone will remain: Bonaparte. All of us who make pretensions to live\r\nare dead already: can the insect's name be read by the feeble light\r\nwhich it sometimes drags with it as it crawls?\r\n\r\nWhen M. le Cardinal Fesch met me again I was Ambassador to Leo XII.; he\r\ngave me marks of his esteem: I on my side made a point of outdoing him\r\nin deference. It is natural, moreover, that I should have been judged\r\nwith a severity which I have never spared myself. All this is past and\r\ndone with: I do not wish even to recognise the handwriting of those\r\nwho, in 1803, served as official or semi-official secretaries to M. le\r\nCardinal Fesch.\r\n\r\nI set out for Naples: there began a year without Madame de Beaumont,\r\na year of absence to be followed by so many others! I have never seen\r\nNaples again since that time, although I was on the threshold of that\r\nsame town in 1828, having promised myself to go there with Madame de\r\nChateaubriand. The orange-trees were covered with their fruits, the\r\nmyrtles with their flowers. Baie, the Campi Elysei, and the sea were\r\ndelights of which I no longer had any one to whom to speak. I have\r\ndescribed the Bay of Naples in the _Martyrs._[581] I climbed Vesuvius\r\nand descended into its crater. I pilfered from myself: I was enacting a\r\nscene in _René._\r\n\r\nAt Pompeii I was shown a skeleton in irons, and mutilated Latin words\r\nscribbled by soldiers on the walls. I returned to Rome. Canova[582]\r\npermitted me to visit his studio while he was working at the statue of\r\na nymph. Elsewhere the models for the marbles of the tomb which I had\r\nordered had already attained much expression. I went to pray over ashes\r\nat San Luigi, and I left for Paris on the 21st of January 1804, another\r\nday of misfortune.\r\n\r\nBehold a prodigious misery: five and thirty years have sped since the\r\ndate of those events. Did not I flatter myself, in those distant days\r\nof grief, that the bond just broken would be my last? And yet how soon\r\nhave I, not forgotten, but replaced what was dear to me! Thus man\r\ngoes from weakness to weakness. When he is young and drives his life\r\nbefore him, a shadow of an excuse remains to him; but when he gets\r\nbetween the shafts and laboriously drags it behind him, how is he to be\r\nexcused? The poverty of our nature is so intense that in our volatile\r\ninfirmities, in order to express our new affections, we can employ only\r\nwords which we have already worn threadbare in our former attachments.\r\nThere are words, nevertheless, which ought to be used but once: they\r\nbecome profaned by repetition. Our betrayed and neglected friendships\r\nreproach us with the new companionships that we have formed; our hours\r\narraign one another: our life is one perpetual blush, because it is one\r\ncontinued fault.\r\n\r\nAs my intention was not to remain in Paris, I alighted at the Hôtel de\r\nFrance[583], in the Rue de Beaune, where Madame de Chateaubriand came\r\nto join me to accompany me to the Valais. My former society, already\r\nhalf dispersed, had lost the link which held it together.\r\n\r\nBonaparte was marching towards the Empire; his genius rose in the\r\nmeasure that events increased in importance: he was able, like\r\ngunpowder when it expands, to carry away the world; already immense,\r\nand yet not feeling himself at his zenith, he was tormented by his\r\nstrength; he groped, he seemed to be feeling his way; when I arrived in\r\nParis he was dealing with Pichegru and Moreau; through petty envy he\r\nhad consented to admit them as rivals: Moreau, Pichegru, and Georges\r\nCadoudal, who was greatly their superior, were arrested.\r\n\r\nThis vulgar train of conspiracies, which we encounter in all the\r\naffairs of life, was very distasteful to me, and I was glad to seek\r\nflight in the mountains.\r\n\r\nThe council of the town of Sion wrote to me. The simplicity of this\r\ndespatch has made a document of it to me; I was entering politics\r\nthrough religion: the _Génie du Christianisme_ had opened the doors for\r\nme.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: I am promoted.]\r\n\r\n    \"REPUBLIC OF THE VALAIS.\r\n\r\n    \"SION, 20 _February_ 1804.\r\n\r\n    \"COUNCIL OF THE TOWN OF SION.\r\n\r\n    \"_To Monsieur Chateaubriand, Secretary of Legation of the\r\n    French Republic in Rome._\r\n\r\n    \"SIR,\r\n\r\n    \"An official letter from our High Bailiff apprizes us of your\r\n    nomination to the post of French Minister to our Republic.\r\n    We hasten to express to you the very complete satisfaction\r\n    which this choice gives us.

The gallery in\r\nwhich he was receiving was full; he was accompanied by Murat and a\r\nprincipal aide-de-camp; he passed through almost without stopping.\r\nAs he approached me, I was struck by the alteration in his face:\r\nhis cheeks were sunk and livid, his eyes hard, his complexion pale\r\nand muddy, his aspect gloomy and terrible. The attraction which had\r\npreviously urged me towards him ceased; instead of remaining on his\r\npassage, I made a movement to avoid him. He threw a glance at me as\r\nthough to seek to recognise me, took a few steps towards me, then\r\nturned and walked away. Had I appeared to him as a warning? His\r\naide-de-camp noticed me: when the crowd covered me, the aide-de-camp\r\ntried to catch sight of me between the persons standing before me, and\r\nagain drew the Consul in my direction. This sport continued for nearly\r\na quarter of an hour, I always drawing back, Napoleon always following\r\nme without knowing it. I have never been able to explain to myself what\r\nidea had struck the aide-de-camp. Did he take me for a suspicious man\r\nwhom he had never seen? Did he, if he knew who I was, wish to force\r\nBonaparte to speak to me? However this may be, Napoleon passed on to\r\nanother apartment. Content to have done my duty in presenting myself\r\nat the Tuileries, I withdrew. From the joy which I have always felt at\r\nleaving palaces, it is evident that I was not made to enter them.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Bonaparte.]\r\n\r\nOn returning to the Hôtel de France, I said to several of my friends:\r\n\r\n\"Something strange must be happening, of which we do not know, for\r\nBonaparte cannot have changed to that extent, unless he be ill.\"\r\n\r\nM. de Bourrienne[585] knew of my singular foresight: he has only\r\nconfused the dates; here is his sentence:\r\n\r\n    \"On returning from the First Consul's, M. de Chateaubriand\r\n    declared to his friends that he had remarked a great\r\n    alteration in the First Consul, and something very sinister\r\n    in his look[586].\"\r\n\r\nYes, I remarked it: a superior intelligence does not bring forth evil\r\nwithout pain, because that is not its natural fruit, and it ought not\r\nto bear it.\r\n\r\nTwo days later, on the 21st of March[587], I rose early, for the sake\r\nof a memory that was sad and dear to me. M. de Montmorin had built\r\nhimself a house at the corner of the Rue Plumet, on the new Boulevard\r\ndes Invalides. In the garden of that house, which was sold during the\r\nRevolution, Madame de Beaumont, then almost a child, had planted a\r\ncypress-tree, and she had sometimes taken pleasure in showing it to\r\nme as we passed: it was to this cypress-tree, of which I alone knew\r\nthe origin and the history, that I went to bid adieu. It still exists,\r\nbut it is pining away, and scarce rises to the level of the casement\r\nbeneath which a hand which has vanished loved to tend it. I distinguish\r\nthat poor tree from among three or four others of its species; it seems\r\nto know me and to rejoice when I approach; mournful breezes bend its\r\nyellowed head a little towards me, and it murmurs at the window of the\r\ndeserted room: a mysterious intelligence reigns between us, which will\r\ncease when one or the other shall have fallen.\r\n\r\nHaving paid my pious tribute, I went down the Boulevard and Esplanade\r\ndes Invalides, crossed the Pont Louis XV. and the Tuileries Gardens,\r\nwhich I left, near the Pavilion Marsan, by the gate which now opens\r\ninto the Rue de Rivoli. There, between eleven and twelve o'clock in the\r\nmorning, I heard a man and a woman crying official news; passers-by\r\nwere stopping, suddenly petrified by these words:\r\n\r\n    \"Verdict of the special military commission summoned at\r\n    Vincennes, condemning to pain of death THE MAN KNOWN AS LOUIS\r\n    ANTOINE HENRI DE BOURBON, BORN ON THE 2ND OF AUGUST 1772 AT\r\n    CHANTILLY.\"\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Death of the Duc D'Enghien.]\r\n\r\nThis cry fell upon me like a thunderbolt; it changed my life, as it\r\nchanged Napoleon's. I returned home; I said to Madame Chateaubriand:\r\n\r\n\"The Duc d'Enghien has been shot.\"\r\n\r\nI sat down to a table and began to write my resignation[588]. Madame\r\nde Chateaubriand raised no objection, and with great courage watched\r\nme writing. She did not blind herself to my danger: General Moreau and\r\nGeorges Cadoudal were being prosecuted[589]; the lion had tasted blood,\r\nthis was not the moment to irritate him.\r\n\r\nM. Clausel de Coussergues[590] arrived in the interval; he also had\r\nheard the sentence cried. He found me pen in hand: my letter, from\r\nwhich, out of compassion for Madame de Chateaubriand, he made me\r\nsuppress certain angry phrases, was despatched; it was addressed to\r\nthe Minister of Foreign Relations. The wording mattered little: my\r\nopinion and my crime lay in the fact of my resignation: Bonaparte made\r\nno mistake as to that. Madame Bacciochi exclaimed loudly on hearing\r\nof what she called my \"disloyalty;\" she sent for me and made me the\r\nliveliest reproaches. M. de Fontanes at first went almost mad with\r\nfear: he already saw me shot, with all the persons who were attached to\r\nme. During several days, my friends went in dread of seeing me carried\r\noff by the police; they called on me from one minute to the other,\r\nalways trembling as they approached the porter's lodge. M. Pasquier\r\ncame and embraced me on the day after my resignation, saying he was\r\nhappy to have such a friend as I. He remained for a fairly considerable\r\ntime in an honourably moderate opposition, removed from place and power.\r\n\r\nNevertheless, the movement of sympathy which impels us to praise a\r\ngenerous action came to an end. I had, in consideration of religion,\r\naccepted a place outside France, a place conferred upon me by a mighty\r\ngenius, the conqueror of anarchy, a leader sprung from the popular\r\nprinciple, the _consul_ of a _republic_, and not a king continuing an\r\nusurped _monarchy_; at that time I stood alone in my feeling, because\r\nI was consistent in my conduct; I retired when the conditions to which\r\nI was able to subscribe altered; but, so soon as the hero had changed\r\nhimself into a murderer, there came a rush for his ante-chamber. Six\r\nmonths after the 21st of March, one might have thought that there was\r\nonly one opinion in society, but for a few malicious jests in which\r\npeople indulged in private. _Fallen_ persons pretended to have been\r\n_violated_, and only they, it was said, were _violated_ who possessed a\r\ngreat name or great importance, and each one, to prove his importance\r\nor his quarterings, contrived to be _violated_ by dint of solicitation.\r\n\r\nThose who had most loudly applauded me fell away; my presence was a\r\nreproach to them: prudent people find imprudence in those who yield\r\nto honour. There are times in which loftiness of soul is a real\r\ninfirmity; no one understands it; it passes for a sort of narrowness\r\nof mind, for a prejudice, an unintelligent trick of education, a\r\ncrotchet, a whim which interferes with the judgment: an honourable\r\nimbecility, perhaps, but a stupid helotism. What capacity can any one\r\nfind in shutting your eyes, in remaining indifferent to the march of\r\nthe century, to the movement of ideas, to the change of manners, to\r\nthe progress of society? Is it not a deplorable mistake to attach to\r\nevents an importance which they do not possess? Barricaded behind\r\nyour narrow principles, your mind as limited as your judgment, you\r\nare like a man living at the back of a house, looking out only on a\r\nlittle yard, unaware of what happens in the street or of the noise to\r\nbe heard outside. That is what a little independence reduces you to,\r\nan object of pity to the average man: as to the great minds with their\r\naffectionate pride and their haughty eyes, _oculos sublimes_[591],\r\ntheir compassionate disdain forgives you, because they know that \"you\r\ncannot hear[592].\" I therefore shrank back humbly into my literary\r\ncareer, a poor Pindar destined in my first Olympic to praise \"the\r\nexcellence of water,\" leaving wine to the happy.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: I resign my Embassy.]\r\n\r\nFriendship put fresh heart into M. de Fontanes; Madame Bacciochi placed\r\nher kindness between her brother's anger and my resolution; M. de\r\nTalleyrand, through indifference or calculation, kept my resignation\r\nfor several days before speaking of it: when he announced it to\r\nBonaparte the latter had had time to reflect. On receiving from me the\r\nonly direct sign of blame from an honest man who was not afraid to defy\r\nhim, he uttered merely these two words:\r\n\r\n\"Very well.\"\r\n\r\nLater, he said to his sister:\r\n\r\n\"Were you very much alarmed for your friend?\"\r\n\r\nLong after, in conversation with M. de Fontanes, he confessed that\r\nmy resignation was one of the things that had impressed him most\r\nM. de Talleyrand had an official letter sent to me in which he\r\ngracefully reproached me for depriving his department of my talents\r\nand services[593]. I returned the expenses of installation, and all\r\nwas apparently finished. But, in daring to leave Bonaparte, I had\r\nplaced myself upon his level, and he was incensed against me with all\r\nthe strength of his perfidy, as I against him with all that of my\r\nloyalty. Till the day of his fall, he held the sword suspended over\r\nmy head: sometimes he returned to me by a natural leaning and tried to\r\ndrown me in his fatal prosperity; sometimes I was drawn to him by the\r\nadmiration with which he inspired me, by the idea that I was assisting\r\nat a transformation of society, not at a mere change of dynasty: but\r\nantipathetic in so many respects, our respective natures gained the\r\nupper hand, and if he would gladly have had me shot, I should have felt\r\nno great compunction in killing him.\r\n\r\nDeath makes a great man or unmakes him; it stops him on the stair which\r\nhe was about to descend, or on the step which he was about to climb:\r\nhis is a destiny that has succeeded or failed; in the first case, one\r\nis reduced to examine what it has been, in the second to conjecture\r\nwhat it might have become.\r\n\r\nIf, in doing my duty, I had been prompted by far-seeing views of\r\nambition, I should have deceived myself. Charles X. learnt only at\r\nPrague what I had done in 1804: he had but lately been King.\r\n\r\n\"Chateaubriand,\" he said to me at the Castle of Hradschin, \"had you\r\nserved Bonaparte?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, Sire.\"\r\n\r\n\"Did you resign on the death of M. le Duc d'Enghien?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, Sire.\"\r\n\r\nMisfortune instructs or restores the memory. I have told you how one\r\nday in London, when I had taken shelter with M. de Fontanes in a\r\npassage during a storm, M. le Duc de Bourbon came and sought cover\r\nunder the same refuge: in France, his gallant father and he, who\r\nso politely thanked whoever wrote a funeral oration on M. le Duc\r\nd'Enghien, did not send me one word of remembrance; they were doubtless\r\nunaware of my conduct: true, I never told them of it.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[446] This book was commenced in Paris in 1837, continued and completed\r\nin Paris in 1838, and revised in February 1845 and December 1846.--T.\r\n\r\n[447] The Château du Marais was built by M.

In 1814, she came into contact with the foreign sovereigns\r\nthen in Paris, exercised a great ascendant over the Emperor Alexander,\r\nforetold to him the return of Napoleon from Elba and his ultimate\r\nfall, and inspired him with the idea of the Holy Alliance.

In order to cheat this instinct, I made\r\nfor Chantilly. I have wandered on the lawn, where old keepers crawl\r\nalong the border of the woods. Some crows, flying in front of me over\r\nbroom, coppice and glades, have led me to the Commelle Ponds. Death\r\nhas breathed upon the friends who used to accompany me to the castle\r\nof Queen Blanche[595]: the sites of these solitudes were but a sad\r\nhorizon, half-opened for a moment on the side of my past. In the days\r\nof René, I should have found mysteries of life in the little stream of\r\nthe Thève: it steals hidden among horse-tails and mosses; reeds screen\r\nit from sight; it dies in the ponds which it feeds with its youth, ever\r\nexpiring, ever renewed: those ripples used to charm me when I bore\r\nwithin myself the desert with the phantoms which smiled to me, for all\r\ntheir melancholy, and which I decked with flowers.\r\n\r\nWalking back along the hedges, now scarcely traced, I was surprised by\r\nthe rain; I took shelter beneath a beech: its last leaves were falling\r\nlike my years; its top was stripping itself like my head; its trunk\r\nwas marked with a red circle, to be cut down like myself. Now that\r\nI have returned to my inn, with a harvest of autumn plants and in a\r\nmood little suited for joy, I will tell you of the death of M. le Duc\r\nd'Enghien while within sight of the ruins of Chantilly.\r\n\r\n*\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Protest of Louis XVIII.]\r\n\r\nThis death at first froze all hearts with terror; men dreaded a return\r\nof the reign of Robespierre. Paris thought it was seeing again one\r\nof those days which men do not see more than once, the day of the\r\nexecution of Louis XVI. Bonaparte's servants, friends and family were\r\nstruck with consternation. Abroad, though the language of diplomacy\r\npromptly stifled the popular feeling, the latter none the less stirred\r\nthe hearts of the crowd. In the exiled family of the Bourbons, the\r\nblow struck through and through: Louis XVIII. returned to the King of\r\nSpain[596] the Order of the Golden Fleece, with which Bonaparte had\r\njust been decorated; it was accompanied by a letter which did honour to\r\nthe royal mind:\r\n\r\n    \"SIR AND DEAR COUSIN,\r\n\r\n    \"There can be nothing in common between me and the great\r\n    criminal whom audacity and fortune have placed on a throne\r\n    which he has had the barbarity to stain with the blood of a\r\n    Bourbon, the Duc d'Enghien. Religion may prompt me to forgive\r\n    an assassin; but the tyrant of my people must always be my\r\n    enemy. Providence, for inexplicable reasons, can condemn me\r\n    to end my days in exile; but never shall my contemporaries\r\n    nor posterity be able to say that I showed myself in time of\r\n    adversity unworthy to occupy, till my last breath, the throne\r\n    of my ancestors.\"\r\n\r\nWe must not forget another name connected with that of the Duc\r\nd'Enghien: Gustavus Adolphus[597], since dethroned and exiled, was the\r\nonly one of the kings then reigning who dared to raise a voice to save\r\nthe young French Prince. He dispatched an aide-de-camp from Carlsruhe\r\nbearing a letter for Bonaparte; the letter arrived too late: the last\r\nof the Condés was no more. Gustavus Adolphus returned the ribbon of the\r\nBlack Eagle to the King of Prussia[598], as Louis XVIII. had returned\r\nthe Golden Fleece to the King of Spain. Gustavus declared to the heir\r\nof Frederic the Great that, \"according to the laws of chivalry, he\r\ncould not consent to be the brother-in-arms of the butcher of the Duc\r\nd'Enghien[599].\" There is an inexpressibly bitter irony in these almost\r\nmad memories of chivalry, everywhere extinct, save in the heart of an\r\nunhappy king for a murdered friend; honour to the noble sympathies of\r\nmisfortune, which stand aloof, not understood, in a world unknown to\r\nmen!\r\n\r\nAlas, we had undergone too many different tyrannies; our characters,\r\nbroken by a succession of hardships and oppressions, lacked sufficient\r\nenergy to allow our grief long to wear mourning for the death of\r\nyoung Condé: gradually the tears dried up; fear overflowed with\r\ncongratulations on the dangers from which the First Consul had just\r\nescaped; it wept with gratitude at having been saved by a so sacred\r\nimmolation. Nero[600], at Seneca's[601] dictation, wrote to the Senate\r\na letter of apology for the murder of Agrippina[602]; the Senators,\r\ndelighted, heaped blessings upon the magnanimous son who had not feared\r\nto pluck out his heart by so salutary an act of parricide! Society soon\r\nreturned to its pleasures; it was afraid of its mourning: after the\r\nTerror, the victims who had been spared danced, forced themselves to\r\nappear happy and, fearing lest they should be suspected guilty of the\r\ncrime of memory, displayed the same gaiety as when they went to the\r\nscaffold.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The Duc D'Enghien's arrest.]\r\n\r\nThe Duc d'Enghien was not arrested point-blank and without\r\nprecautions: Bonaparte had had a report drawn up of the number of\r\nBourbons in Europe. In a council to which Messieurs de Talleyrand and\r\nFouché were summoned, it was recognised that the Duc d'Angoulême was at\r\nWarsaw, with Louis XVIII.; the Comte d'Artois and the Duc de Berry in\r\nLondon, with the Princes de Condé and de Bourbon. The youngest of the\r\nCondés was at Ettenheim, in the Duchy of Baden. It was found that two\r\nEnglish agents, Messrs. Taylor and Drake, had conducted intrigues in\r\nthat quarter. On the 16th of June 1803 the Duc de Bourbon[603] warned\r\nhis grandson against a possible arrest by means of a note addressed\r\nto him from London, which is still preserved. Bonaparte summoned the\r\ntwo Consuls, his colleagues, to his side. He first bitterly reproached\r\nM. Réal[604] for having left him in ignorance of what was being\r\nplanned against him. He patiently listened to the objections. The\r\none to express himself with the greatest vigour was Cambacérès[605].\r\nBonaparte thanked him and took no further notice. This is what I have\r\nseen in the Memoirs of Cambacérès, which one of his nephews, M. de\r\nCambacérès, a peer of France, has permitted me to consult with an\r\nobligingness of which I retain a grateful recollection. The bomb once\r\nthrown does not return: it goes where the engineer flings it, and\r\nfalls. To execute Bonaparte's orders, it was necessary to violate the\r\nterritory of Germany, and the territory was violated forthwith. The\r\nDuc d'Enghien was arrested at Ettenheim. With him were found, instead\r\nof General Dumouriez, only the Marquis de Thumery and some other\r\nEmigrants of little note: this ought to have shown the mistake. The Duc\r\nd'Enghien was taken to Strasburg. The beginning of the catastrophe of\r\nVincennes has been narrated by the Prince himself: he has left a little\r\nroad-journal from Ettenheim to Strasburg; the hero of the tragedy steps\r\nbefore the curtain to recite this prologue:\r\n\r\n    \"Thursday 15 March, at Ettenheim, my house surrounded,\" says\r\n    the Prince, \"by a detachment of dragoons and some pickets of\r\n    gendarmes, total about two hundred men, two generals, the\r\n    colonel of the dragoons, Colonel Chariot of the Strasburg\r\n    Gendarmerie, at five o'clock[606]. At half-past five, doors\r\n    broken in, taken to the Mill, near the Tile-works. My papers\r\n    taken away, sealed up. Taken in a cart, between two lines of\r\n    fusiliers, to the Rhine. Put on board a boat for Rhisnau.\r\n    Landed and marched on foot as far as Pfortsheim. Breakfasted\r\n    at the inn. Got into a carriage with Colonel Chariot, the\r\n    quarter-master of the gendarmes, a gendarme on the box and\r\n    Grunstein. Arrived at Strasburg, at Colonel Chariot's,\r\n    about half-past five. Transferred half an hour after, in a\r\n    hackney-coach, to the citadel.\r\n\r\n    . . . . . . . .\r\n\r\n    \"Sunday 18, they come to fetch me at half-past one in the\r\n    morning. They do not give me time to dress. I embrace my\r\n    unhappy companions, my servants. I leave alone with two\r\n    officers of gendarmes and two gendarmes. Colonel Chariot\r\n    told me that we were going to the general of division,\r\n    who has received orders from Paris. Instead of that, I\r\n    find a carriage with six post-horses in the Church Square.\r\n    Lieutenant Petermann gets in beside me, Blitersdorff the\r\n    quarter-master on the box, two gendarmes inside, the other\r\n    out.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nHere the ship-wrecked man, on the point of being engulfed, interrupts\r\nhis log.\r\n\r\nThe carriage arrived at about four o'clock in the evening at one of the\r\nbarriers of the capital, where the Strasburg road ends, and instead\r\nof driving into Paris, followed the outer boulevard and stopped at\r\nVincennes Castle. The Prince alighted from the carriage in the inner\r\ncourt-yard and was taken to a room of the fortress, where he was locked\r\nin and went to sleep. As the Prince was approaching Paris, Bonaparte\r\naffected an air of calmness which was not natural.\r\n\r\nOn the 18th of March, which was Palm Sunday, he went to the Malmaison.\r\nMadame Bonaparte[607], who, with all her family, was informed of the\r\nPrince's arrest, spoke to him of this arrest. Bonaparte replied:\r\n\r\n\"You don't understand politics.\"\r\n\r\nColonel Savary[608] had become one of Bonaparte's intimates. Why?\r\nBecause he had seen the First Consul weep at Marengo. Exceptional\r\nmen should distrust their tears, which place them beneath the yoke\r\nof vulgar men. Tears are one of those weaknesses which enable an\r\neyewitness to make himself master of a great man's resolutions.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: He is taken to Vincennes.]\r\n\r\nThey say that the First Consul himself had all the orders for Vincennes\r\ndrawn up. One of these orders provided that, if the expected sentence\r\nwas a death sentence, it was to be executed on the spot.\r\n\r\nI believe this version, although I cannot vouch for its truth, since\r\nthose orders are missing. Madame de Rémusat[609], who was playing chess\r\nwith the First Consul at the Malmaison on the evening of the 20th of\r\nMarch, heard him mutter some verses on the clemency of Augustus[610];\r\nshe thought that Bonaparte was coming to himself again and that the\r\nPrince was saved[611]. No, destiny had pronounced its oracle!\r\n\r\nWhen Savary reappeared at Malmaison, Madame Bonaparte divined the whole\r\nmisfortune. The First Consul had locked himself up alone for many\r\nhours. And then the wind blew, and all was ended.\r\n\r\n*\r\n\r\nAn order of Bonaparte, dated 29 Ventôse, Year XII[612], had decreed\r\nthat a military commission, consisting of seven members appointed by\r\nGeneral the Governor of Paris[613] should meet at Vincennes to try\r\n\"the _ci-devant_ Duc d'Enghien, accused of bearing arms against the\r\nRepublic,\" etc.\r\n\r\nIn fulfilment of this decree, Joachim Murat on the same day, 29\r\nVentôse, appointed the seven officers who were to form the said\r\ncommission, namely:\r\n\r\nGeneral Hulin[614], commanding the Foot Grenadiers of the Consular\r\nGuard, president;\r\n\r\nColonel Guitton, commanding the 1st Regiment of Cuirassiers;\r\n\r\nColonel Bazancourt, commanding the 4th Regiment of Light Infantry;\r\n\r\nColonel Ravier, commanding the 18th Regiment of Infantry of the Line;\r\n\r\nColonel Barrois, commanding the 96th Regiment of Infantry of the Line;\r\n\r\nColonel Rabbe, commanding the 2nd Regiment of the Municipal Guard of\r\nParis;\r\n\r\nCitizen Dautancourt, Major of the Gendarmerie d'Élite, with the\r\nfunctions of captain-judge-advocate.\r\n\r\nCaptain Dautancourt, Major Jacquin of the Légion d'Élite, two foot\r\ngendarmes of the same corps, Lerva and Tharsis, and Citizen Noirot, a\r\nlieutenant in the same corps, went to the Duc d'Enghien's and awoke\r\nhim: he had but four hours to wait before returning to his sleep. The\r\njudge-advocate, assisted by Molin, a captain in the 18th Regiment,\r\nchosen as registrar by the aforesaid judge-advocate, examined the\r\nPrince.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: And examined.]\r\n\r\n_Asked_: His surname, Christian names, age, and birthplace?\r\n\r\n_Answered_: That his name was Louis Antoine Henri de Bourbon, Duc\r\nd'Enghien, born 2 August 1772 at Chantilly.\r\n\r\n_Asked_: Where he had resided since he left France?\r\n\r\n_Answered_: That, after accompanying his relations, Condé's Corps\r\nhaving been formed, he had served through the whole war, and that,\r\nbefore that, he had been through the campaign of 1792, in Brabant, with\r\nBourbon's Corps.\r\n\r\n_Asked_: If he had not gone to England, and if that Power did not still\r\nallow him a salary?\r\n\r\n_Answered_: That he had never been there; that England still allowed\r\nhim his pay, which was all he had to live upon.\r\n\r\n_Asked_: What rank he filled in Condé's Army?\r\n\r\n_Answered_: Commander of the Advance Guard in 1796; before that\r\ncampaign, as a volunteer at his grandfather's headquarters; and, ever\r\nsince 1796, Commander of the Advance Guard.\r\n\r\n_Asked_: If he knew General Pichegru, and if he had had relations with\r\nhim?\r\n\r\n_Answered_: \"I have never seen him, to my knowledge. I have had no\r\nrelations with him. I know that he wished to see me. I am glad that I\r\nnever knew him, because of the base methods which he is said to have\r\nwished to employ, if true.\"\r\n\r\n_Asked_: If he knew ex-General Dumouriez, and if he had had relations\r\nwith him?\r\n\r\n_Answered_: \"Not with him either.\"\r\n\r\n*\r\n\r\n\"Whence,\" continues the report, \"were drawn up these presents, which\r\nhave been signed by the Duc d'Enghien, Major Jacquin, Lieutenant\r\nNoirot, the two gendarmes, and captain-judge-advocate.\r\n\r\n\"Before signing this present report the Duc d'Enghien said:\r\n\r\n\"'I earnestly make a request to be granted a private audience of the\r\nFirst Consul. My name, my rank, my way of thinking and the horror of my\r\nsituation make me hope that he will not refuse my request.'\"\r\n\r\n\r\nAt two o'clock on the morning of the 21st of March, the Duc d'Enghien\r\nwas taken to the room in which the commission sat, and repeated what\r\nhe had said in examination by the judge-advocate. He persisted in his\r\ndeclaration: he added that he was willing to make war, and that he\r\nwished for service in the new war of England against France.\r\n\r\n\"Asked whether he had anything to put forward in the plea of his\r\ndefense; answered that he had nothing more to say.\r\n\r\n\"The president ordered the prisoner to withdraw; the council\r\ndeliberated with closed doors; the president took the votes, commencing\r\nwith the junior in rank; next, the president having given his opinion\r\nlast, the Duc d'Enghien was unanimously declared guilty, and the\r\nCourt applied Article ... of the law of the... thus worded.... and\r\nin consequence condemned him to the penalty of death. Ordered, on\r\nthe demand of the captain-judge-advocate, that the present sentence,\r\nafter being read to the condemned man, shall be executed directly, in\r\npresence of the different detachments of the corps of the garrison.\r\n\r\n\"Given, concluded, and tried at one sitting, at Vincennes, on the day,\r\nmonth and year as above, as witness our hands.\"\r\n\r\n*\r\n\r\nThe grave having been \"dug, filled up, and closed,\" ten years of\r\nforgetfulness, of general assent and of unexampled glory sat down upon\r\nit; the grass sprang up to the sound of the salvoes which proclaimed\r\nvictories, by the light of the illuminations which shed their lustre\r\nover the pontifical coronation, the marriage of the daughter of the\r\nCæsars[615], and the birth of the King of Rome[616]. Only some rare\r\nsympathizers rambled in the wood, hazarding a furtive glance at the\r\nbottom of the moat in the direction of the lamentable spot, while a few\r\nprisoners watched them from the top of the donjon in which they were\r\nconfined. Then came the Restoration: the earth of the tomb was stirred,\r\nand with it men's consciences; each then thought it his duty to explain\r\nhimself.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Duc D'Enghien.]\r\n\r\nM. Dupin the Elder[617] published his Discussion; M. Hulin, the\r\npresident of the military commission, spoke; M. le Duc de Rovigo\r\nentered into the controversy by accusing M. de Talleyrand; a third\r\nparty replied on behalf of M. de Talleyrand; and Napoleon raised his\r\nmighty voice on the rock of St. Helena.\r\n\r\nThese documents must be reproduced and studied, in order to assign to\r\neach the part due to him and the place which he should occupy in this\r\ndrama. It is night, and we are at Chantilly; it was night when the Duc\r\nd'Enghien was at Vincennes.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: M. Dupin's pamphlet.]\r\n\r\nWhen M. Dupin published his pamphlet he sent it to me with the\r\nfollowing letter:\r\n\r\n    \"PARIS, 10 _November_ 1823.\r\n\r\n    \"MONSIEUR LE VICOMTE,\r\n\r\n    \"Pray accept a copy of my publication relative to the murder\r\n    of the Duc d'Enghien.\r\n\r\n    \"It would have appeared long ago, had I not desired above all\r\n    to respect the wish of Monseigneur le Duc de Bourbon, who,\r\n    having been informed of my work, had communicated to me his\r\n    desire that this deplorable affair might not be disinterred.\r\n\r\n    \"But Providence having permitted others to take the\r\n    initiative, it has become necessary to make the truth known,\r\n    and after assuring myself that it was no longer insisted that\r\n    I should remain silent, I have spoken with frankness and\r\n    sincerity.\r\n\r\n    \"I have the honour to be, with profound respect,\r\n\r\n    \"monsieur le vicomte,\r\n\r\n    \"Your Excellency's most humble and obedient servant,\r\n\r\n    \"DUPIN.\"\r\n\r\nM. Dupin, whom I congratulated and thanked, revealed in his covering\r\nletter an unknown and touching instance of the noble and merciful\r\nvirtues of the victim's father. M. Dupin commences his pamphlet thus:\r\n\r\n    \"The death of the unfortunate Duc d'Enghien is one of the\r\n    most afflicting events that ever befel the French nation: it\r\n    dishonoured the consular government.\r\n\r\n    \"A young prince, in the flower of his age, surprised by\r\n    treachery on foreign soil, where he was sleeping in peace\r\n    under the protection of the Law of Nations; dragged violently\r\n    to France; indicted before pretended judges, who could in\r\n    no case be his; accused of imaginary crimes; denied the\r\n    assistance of counsel; examined and sentenced behind closed\r\n    doors; put to death at night in the moat of the castle which\r\n    was used as a State prison; so many virtues unheeded, such\r\n    fond hopes destroyed, will ever stamp this catastrophe as one\r\n    of the most revolting acts that an absolute government ever\r\n    ventured to commit.\r\n\r\n    \"If no form was respected; if the judges were incompetent;\r\n    if they did not even take the trouble to mention in their\r\n    judgment the date and text of the laws upon which they\r\n    affected to ground their condemnation; if the unhappy Duc\r\n    d'Enghien was shot in pursuance of a sentence _signed in\r\n    blank._... and only made regular after execution! then we\r\n    have to do not only with the innocent victim of judicial\r\n    error; the thing assumes its true name: it is an odious\r\n    murder.\"\r\n\r\nThis eloquent exordium brings M. Dupin to the examination of the\r\ndocuments. He first proves the illegality of the arrest: the Duc\r\nd'Enghien was not arrested in France; he was in no way a prisoner of\r\nwar, since he had not been taken with arms in his hands; he was not a\r\nprisoner in the civil sense, for no extradition had been demanded; it\r\nwas a violent seizure of the person, comparable to the captures made\r\nby the pirates of Tunis and Algiers, an inroad of robbers, _incursio\r\nlatronum._\r\n\r\nThe jurist proceeds to discuss the incompetency of the military\r\ncommission: cognizance of alleged plots hatched against the State has\r\nnever been conferred upon military commissions.\r\n\r\nNext follows the analysis of the judgment.\r\n\r\n*\r\n\r\n    \"The examination,\" continues M. Dupin, \"took place on the 29\r\n    Ventôse at midnight. On the 30 Ventôse, at two o'clock in the\r\n    morning, the Duc d'Enghien was brought before the military\r\n    commission.\r\n\r\n    \"On the minutes of the judgment we read, 'This day, the 30\r\n    Ventôse, Year XII of the Republic, _at two o'clock in the\r\n    morning._' The words, 'at two o'clock in the morning,' which\r\n    were only inserted because it was in fact that time, are\r\n    obliterated on the minutes without being replaced by any\r\n    other indication.\r\n\r\n    \"Not a single witness was heard or produced against the\r\n    prisoner.\r\n\r\n    \"The accused 'was declared guilty!' Guilty of what? The\r\n    judgment does not say.\r\n\r\n    \"Every judgment that pronounces a penalty is bound to contain\r\n    a reference to the law by virtue of which such penalty is\r\n    inflicted.\r\n\r\n    [Sidenote: A scathing indictment.]\r\n\r\n    \"Well, in this case, none of these forms has been fulfilled:\r\n    nothing in the official report bears witness that the\r\n    commissioners had _a copy of the law_ before them; nothing\r\n    shows that the president _read the text_ of the law before\r\n    applying it. Far from it: the judgment in its material form\r\n    affords the proof that the commissioners convicted without\r\n    knowing either the date or the tenor of the law; for, in\r\n    the minutes of the judgment, they have _left in blank_ the\r\n    date of the law, the number of the article, and the place\r\n    in which the precise words should have been quoted. And yet\r\n    it was on the minutes of a sentence framed in this state of\r\n    imperfection that the noblest blood was shed by butchers!\r\n\r\n    \"The deliberation must be secret, but the judgment must be\r\n    pronounced in public: again, it is the law that speaks. Now\r\n    the judgment of the 30 Ventôse certainly says, 'The council\r\n    deliberated _with closed doors_;' but it does not mention\r\n    that the doors were opened again, or intimate that the result\r\n    of the deliberation was pronounced in a public sitting. Even\r\n    had it said so, who would believe it? A public sitting at two\r\n    o'clock in the morning, in the donjon of Vincennes, while\r\n    all the issues of the castle were being guarded by gendarmes\r\n    d'élite! But the fact is that they did not even take the\r\n    precaution to resort to a lie: the judgment is silent on this\r\n    point.\r\n\r\n    \"This judgment is signed by the president and the six other\r\n    commissioners, including the judge-advocate; but observe\r\n    that the minutes _are not signed by the registrar_, whose\r\n    concurrence, however, is necessary to give them authenticity.\r\n\r\n    \"The sentence concludes with this terrible formula:\r\n    '_shall be executed_ FORTHWITH, _under the care of the\r\n    captain-judge-advocate._'\r\n\r\n    \"FORTHWITH! Cruel word, the work of the judges! FORTHWITH!\r\n    And an express law, that of the 15 Brumaire, Year VI, granted\r\n    the right of appeal for a new trial against any military\r\n    judgment!\"\r\n\r\nPassing to the execution, M. Dupin continues as follows:\r\n\r\n    \"Examined at night and tried at night, the Duc d'Enghien\r\n    was also killed at night. This horrible sacrifice was to be\r\n    consummated in the dark, in order that it might be said that\r\n    all laws had been infringed, all, even those which prescribed\r\n    that executions shall take place in public.\"\r\n\r\nThe jurist comes to the irregularities in the preliminaries:\r\n\r\n    \"Article 19 of the law of the 13 Brumaire, Year V, declares\r\n    that, after closing the examination, the judge-advocate shall\r\n    tell the prisoner to 'choose a friend as his defender.' The\r\n    prisoner shall have 'the power to choose that defender' among\r\n    every class of citizen present on the spot; if he declares\r\n    that he is unable to make that choice, the judge-advocate\r\n    shall make it for him.\r\n\r\n    \"Ah, no doubt the Prince had no _friends_[618] among those\r\n    who surrounded him; this fact was cruelly declared to him by\r\n    one of the abettors of that horrible scene!... Alas, why were\r\n    we not present! Why was the prince not allowed to make an\r\n    appeal to the bar of Paris! There he would have found friends\r\n    of his unhappiness, defenders of his misfortune. ... It was\r\n    apparently with a view to making the judgment presentable\r\n    in the eyes of the public that a new edition was drawn up\r\n    at leisure.... The tardy substitution of a second form of\r\n    judgment, in appearance more regular than the first (although\r\n    equally unjust), in no way detracts from the heinousness of\r\n    having put the Duc d'Enghien to death by virtue of a rough\r\n    draft of a judgment, hastily signed, and not even signed by\r\n    all the requisite parties.\"\r\n\r\n*\r\n\r\nSuch is M. Dupin's luminous pamphlet. Nevertheless I do not know\r\nthat, in an act of the nature of that which the author examines, the\r\ngreater or lesser regularity holds an important place: whether the\r\nDuc d'Enghien was strangled in a post-chaise between Strasburg and\r\nParis or killed in the wood of Vincennes makes no difference. But is\r\nit not providential to see men, after long years, some showing the\r\nirregularity of a murder in which they had taken no part, others\r\nhastening, unasked, to the bar of public accusal? What, then have they\r\nheard? What voice from on high has summoned them to appear?\r\n\r\n*\r\n\r\nAfter the great jurist, here comes a blind veteran: he has commanded\r\nthe Grenadiers of the Old Guard; what that means brave men know. His\r\nlast wound he received from Malet[619], whose powerless lead remained\r\nlost in a face which had never turned from the fire. \"Afflicted with\r\nblindness, withdrawn from the world, consoled only by the care of his\r\nfamily,\" to use his own words, the judge of the Duc d'Enghien appears\r\nto issue from his tomb at the call of the sovereign judge; he pleads\r\nhis cause[620] without self-delusion or excuses:\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: General Hulin's pamphlet.]\r\n\r\n    \"Let there be no mistake,\" he says, \"as to my intentions. I\r\n    am not writing through fear, since my person is under the\r\n    protection of laws emanating from the Throne itself, and\r\n    since, under the government of a righteous king, I have\r\n    nothing to dread from violence or lawlessness.... I write to\r\n    tell the truth, even in what may be to my own detriment! So I\r\n    do not pretend to justify even the form or the substance of\r\n    the judgment; but I wish to show under what a powerful union\r\n    of circumstances it was delivered; I wish to remove from\r\n    myself and my colleagues the suspicion of having acted as\r\n    party men. If we are still to receive blame, I wish also that\r\n    men should say of us:\r\n\r\n    \"'They were very unfortunate.'\"\r\n\r\n*\r\n\r\nGeneral Hulin asserts that he was appointed president of a military\r\ncommission without knowing its object; that when he arrived at\r\nVincennes he was no wiser; that the other members of the commission\r\nknew as little; that M. Harel[621], the governor of the castle, told\r\nhim, on being asked, that he knew nothing himself, adding:\r\n\r\n\"What can I do? I am nobody here now. Everything is done without my\r\norders or participation: another man is in command here.\"\r\n\r\nIt was ten o'clock at night when General Hulin was relieved from\r\nhis uncertainty by the communication of the documents. The hearing\r\nwas opened at midnight, when the examination of the prisoner by the\r\njudge-advocate had been finished.\r\n\r\n    \"The reading of the documents,\" says the president of the\r\n    commission, \"gave rise to an incident. We observed that, at\r\n    the end of his examination before the judge-advocate, the\r\n    Prince, before signing, _wrote with his own hand some lines\r\n    in which he expressed a wish to have an explanation with the\r\n    First Consul._ One of the members proposed that this request\r\n    should be forwarded to the Government. The commission agreed;\r\n    but at the same moment General --------, who had come and\r\n    placed himself behind my chair, pointed out to us that this\r\n    request was 'inopportune.' Moreover, we found no provision in\r\n    the law authorizing us to suspend judgment. The commission\r\n    therefore proceeded, reserving to itself the right to satisfy\r\n    the prisoner's wishes after the trial.\"\r\n\r\n*\r\n\r\nSo far General Hulin. Now, in a pamphlet by the Duc de Rovigo we read\r\nthe following passage:\r\n\r\n    \"There were, indeed, so many people that, as I arrived among\r\n    the last, I found it difficult to make my way to the back of\r\n    the president's chair, where I ultimately placed myself.\"\r\n\r\nAnd so it was the Duc de Rovigo who had \"placed himself behind the\r\nchair\" of the president? But had he, or any other not forming one\r\nof the commission, the right to interfere in the proceedings of the\r\ncommission, and to point out that a request was \"inopportune\"?\r\n\r\nLet us hear the commander of the Grenadiers of the Old Guard speak of\r\nthe courage of the young son of the Condés; he was a judge of it:\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The Duc D'Enghien's courage.]\r\n\r\n    \"I proceeded to examine the prisoner; I must say that\r\n    he stood up to us with a noble confidence, spurned the\r\n    accusation that he had been directly or indirectly implicated\r\n    in a plot to assassinate the First Consul; but also admitted\r\n    that he had borne arms against France, saying, with a courage\r\n    and a pride which did not for a moment permit us, in his\r\n    own interest, to shake him on this point, 'that he had\r\n    supported the rights of his family, and that a Condé could\r\n    never re-enter France without arms in his hands. My birth and\r\n    convictions,' he added, 'make me for ever the enemy of your\r\n    government.'\r\n\r\n    \"His resolute confessions distressed his judges to the\r\n    utmost. Ten times did we give him the opportunity to revise\r\n    his statements, but throughout he persisted unshaken:\r\n\r\n    \"'I perceive,' he said at intervals, 'the honourable\r\n    intentions of the members of the commission; but I cannot\r\n    avail myself of the terms they offer me.'\r\n\r\n    \"And on being warned that military commissions judged without\r\n    appeal:\r\n\r\n    \"'I know that,' he replied, 'and I am quite aware of the\r\n    danger which I am running; I only wish to have an interview\r\n    with the First Consul.'\"\r\n\r\nDoes the whole of our history contain a more pathetic page? New\r\nFrance sitting in judgment upon Old France, doing homage to her,\r\npresenting arms to her, saluting her colours, even while condemning\r\nher; the tribunal set up in the fortress in which the great Condé,\r\nwhen a prisoner, cultivated flowers; the General of the Grenadiers\r\nof Bonaparte's Guard seated face to face with the last descendant of\r\nthe victor of Rocroi, feeling himself moved with admiration before\r\nthe prisoner left without a defender and abandoned by the world,\r\nquestioning him while the sound of the gravedigger digging the grave\r\nmingled with the young soldier's firm replies! A few days after the\r\nexecution, General Hulin exclaimed:\r\n\r\n\"Oh, the brave young man! What courage! I should like to die like that!\"\r\n\r\nGeneral Hulin, after speaking of the \"minutes\" and of the \"second\r\nedition\" of the judgment, says:\r\n\r\n    \"As to the second edition, the only true one, as it did not\r\n    convey the order _for immediate execution, but only for the\r\n    immediate reading of the judgment_ to the condemned man,\r\n    the immediate execution could not have been the act of the\r\n    commission, but only of those who took upon themselves the\r\n    responsibility of hastening the fatal execution.\r\n\r\n    \"Alas, our thoughts were engaged elsewhere! The judgment was\r\n    scarcely signed when I began to write a letter in which, with\r\n    the unanimous consent of the commission, I wrote to inform\r\n    the First Consul of the desire which the Prince had expressed\r\n    to have an interview with him, and also to entreat him to\r\n    remit a penalty which the difficulty of our position did not\r\n    permit us to elude.\r\n\r\n    \"At that moment a man, who had never left the council-hall,\r\n    and whom I would name at once did I not consider that, even\r\n    when defending myself, I ought not to become an accuser,\r\n    approached me and asked:\r\n\r\n    \"'What are you doing there?'\r\n\r\n    \"'I am writing to the First Consul,' I replied, 'to convey to\r\n    him the wishes of the council and of the condemned man.'\r\n\r\n    \"'Your business is done,' said he, taking the pen; 'this is\r\n    now my affair.'\r\n\r\n    \"I protest that I thought, as did several of my colleagues,\r\n    that he meant to say, 'This is my affair, to inform the First\r\n    Consul.' Taken in this sense, the reply left us the hope that\r\n    the information would be none the less conveyed. And how\r\n    could it have occurred to us that there was any one among us\r\n    _that had orders to neglect the formalities prescribed by\r\n    law?_\"\r\n\r\n\r\nThe whole secret of this mournful catastrophe lies in this deposition.\r\nThe veteran who, in daily expectation of dying on the battlefield, had\r\nlearned from death the language of truth, concludes with these final\r\nwords:\r\n\r\n    \"I was talking of what had just happened, in the lobby\r\n    adjoining the hall in which we had deliberated. Separate\r\n    conversations were going forward; I was waiting for my\r\n    carriage, which had not been allowed to drive into the inner\r\n    court-yard, nor had those of the other members, thus delaying\r\n    my departure and theirs. We were closed in, none of us having\r\n    means to communicate with the outside, when an explosion was\r\n    heard: a terrible noise that resounded at the bottom of our\r\n    souls and froze them with terror and affright.\r\n\r\n    \"Yes, I swear, in the name of all my colleagues, that this\r\n    execution was not authorized by us: our judgment stated\r\n    that a copy of it should be sent to the Minister for War,\r\n    to the Chief Judge the Minister for Justice, and to the\r\n    General-in-Chief the Governor of Paris.\r\n\r\n    \"The order of execution could be given regularly only by\r\n    the last-named; the copies had not yet been dispatched;\r\n    they could not be finished before a portion of the day had\r\n    elapsed. On my return to Paris I should have gone in search\r\n    of the Governor, the First Consul, anybody! And suddenly\r\n    a dreadful sound comes to reveal to us that the Prince no\r\n    longer lives!\r\n\r\n    \"We did not know whether he who so cruelly hastened on\r\n    this fatal execution _had orders: if he had none, he alone\r\n    was responsible; if he had orders, the commission, knowing\r\n    nothing of those orders, the commission, forcibly and\r\n    illegally detained_, the commission, whose last wish was for\r\n    the Prince's safety, could neither foresee nor prevent their\r\n    effect. It cannot be accused of the result.\r\n\r\n    \"The lapse of twenty years has not allayed the bitterness of\r\n    my regret!... Let me be accused of ignorance, of error, I\r\n    acquiesce; let me be reproached with an obedience from which\r\n    to-day, under similar circumstances, I should certainly know\r\n    how to escape; with my attachment to a man whom I thought\r\n    destined to promote the happiness of my country; with my\r\n    loyalty to a government which I then considered lawful, and\r\n    which had received my oath; but let some allowance be made to\r\n    me, and also to my colleagues, for the fatal circumstances\r\n    under which we were summoned to decide.\"\r\n\r\nA weak defense, but you repent, general: peace be with you! If your\r\nsentence became the marching-orders of the last of the Condés, you will\r\njoin the last conscript of our old mother-land in the advance-guard\r\nof the dead. The young soldier will gladly share his couch with the\r\ngrenadier of the Old Guard: the France of Freiburg[622] and the France\r\nof Marengo will sleep together.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Enter the Duc de Rovigo.]\r\n\r\nM. le Duc de Rovigo, beating his breast, takes his place in the\r\nprocession that comes to confess at the tomb. I had long been under the\r\npower of the Minister of Police; he fell under the influence which\r\nhe supposed to be restored to me on the return of the Legitimacy:\r\nhe communicated a portion of his Memoirs to me. Men in his position\r\nspeak with wonderful candour of what they have done; they have no\r\nidea of what they are saying against themselves: accusing themselves\r\nwithout perceiving it, they do not suspect the existence of an opinion\r\ndiffering from theirs, both as regards the functions which they had\r\nundertaken and the line of conduct which they have observed. If\r\nthey have been wanting in loyalty, they do not think that they have\r\nbroken their oath; if they have taken upon themselves parts which are\r\nrepugnant to other characters, they believe that they have done great\r\nservices. Their ingenuousness does not justify them, but it excuses\r\nthem.\r\n\r\nM. le Duc de Rovigo consulted me on the chapters in which he treats of\r\nthe death of the Duc d'Enghien: he wished to know my mind, precisely\r\nbecause he knew how I had acted; I valued this mark of his esteem and,\r\nrepaying frankness with frankness, I advised him to publish nothing:\r\n\r\n\"Leave all this,\" said I, \"to die out; in France, oblivion is not slow\r\nin coming. You imagine that you will clear Napoleon of a reproach, and\r\nthrow back the fault upon M. de Talleyrand; but you do not sufficiently\r\nexonerate the former, nor do you sufficiently accuse the latter. You\r\nlay yourself open to attack from your enemies; they will not fail to\r\nreply to you. Why need you remind the public that you were in command\r\nof the Gendarmerie d'Élite at Vincennes? They were not aware of the\r\ndirect part which you played in this fatal deed, and now you tell them\r\nof it. Throw the manuscript into the fire, general: I speak in your own\r\ninterest.\"\r\n\r\nSteeped in the maxims of the imperial government, the Duc de Rovigo\r\nthought that those maxims could be as well applied to the legitimate\r\nthrone; he felt convinced that his pamphlet[623] would reopen the doors\r\nof the Tuileries to him.\r\n\r\nIt is partly by the light of this publication that posterity will trace\r\nthe outlines of the phantoms of grief. I offered to hide the suspect\r\nwho had come to ask shelter of me during the night; he did not accept\r\nthe protection of my house.\r\n\r\nM. de Rovigo tells the story of the departure of M. de\r\nCaulaincourt[624], whom he does not mention by name: he speaks of the\r\nkidnapping at Ettenheim, the prisoner's passing through Strasburg, and\r\nhis arrival at Vincennes. After an expedition on the coast of Normandy,\r\nGeneral Savary had returned to the Malmaison. He was summoned, at\r\nfive o'clock in the evening of the 19th of March 1804, to the closet\r\nof the First Consul, who handed him a sealed letter to be carried to\r\nGeneral Murat, the Governor of Paris. He flew to the general, crossing\r\nwith the Minister of Foreign Relations on his way, and received the\r\norder to take the Gendarmerie d'Élite and go to Vincennes. He went\r\nthere at eight o'clock in the evening, in time to see the members of\r\nthe commission arrive. He soon made his way into the hall where the\r\nPrince was being tried, at one o'clock in the morning of the 21st,\r\nand took a seat behind the president. He gives the Duc d'Enghien's\r\nreplies in about the same terms as they are given in the report of\r\nthe one sitting. He told me that the Prince, after making his final\r\nexplanations, with a quick movement took off his cap, laid it on the\r\ntable and, with the air of a man resigning his life, said to the\r\npresident:\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: His pitiful defense.]\r\n\r\n\"I have nothing more to say, sir.\"\r\n\r\nM. de Rovigo insists upon it that this sitting was in no way secret:\r\n\r\n\r\n\"The doors of the hall,\" he declares, \"were open and free to any who\r\ncared to attend _at that hour._\"\r\n\r\n\r\nM. Dupin had already pointed out the confusion of this argument. In\r\nthis connection M. Achille Roche[625], who appears to write for M. de\r\nTalleyrand, exclaims:\r\n\r\n\"The sitting was in no way secret! At midnight! Held in the inhabited\r\nportion of the castle, in the inhabited portion of a prison! Who, then,\r\nwas present at this sitting? Gaolers, soldiers, executioners!\"\r\n\r\n*\r\n\r\nNo one was in a position to give more exact details concerning the\r\nmoment and place of the thunder-clap than M. le Duc de Rovigo; let us\r\nhear what he says:\r\n\r\n\"After sentence had been pronounced, I withdrew with the officers of\r\nmy corps, who like myself had been present during the proceedings,\r\nand joined the troops stationed on the esplanade of the castle. The\r\nofficer who commanded the infantry of my legion came and told me, with\r\ndeep emotion, that a piquet of men was required of him to execute the\r\nsentence of the military commission:\r\n\r\n\"'Give it,' I replied.\r\n\r\n\"'But where am I to post it?'\r\n\r\n\"'Where you may be sure to hurt nobody.'\r\n\r\n\"For already the roads were full of inhabitants of the populous\r\nenvirons of Paris on their way to attend the different markets.\r\n\r\n\"After carefully examining the ground, the officer chose the moat as\r\nthe place where there was least danger of any one being hurt. M. le Duc\r\nd'Enghien was taken there by the stairs of the entrance-tower, on the\r\npark side, and there heard the sentence pronounced, which was put into\r\neffect.\"\r\n\r\n*\r\n\r\nBelow this paragraph, the author of the memorial appends the following\r\nfootnote:\r\n\r\n\"Between the passing of the sentence and its execution, a grave was\r\ndug, which gave rise to the report that it had been prepared prior to\r\nthe judgment.\"\r\n\r\nUnfortunately, we meet here with deplorable inaccuracies:\r\n\r\n    \"M. de Rovigo contends,\" says M. Achille Roche, M. de\r\n    Talleyrand's apologist, \"that he obeyed orders! Who conveyed\r\n    to him the order for the execution? It appears that it was\r\n    a certain M. Delga, killed at Wagram. But whether it be M.\r\n    Delga or not, if M. Savary is mistaken in mentioning M. Delga\r\n    to us, no one, doubtless, to-day, will lay claim to the fame\r\n    conferred upon that officer. M. de Rovigo is accused of\r\n    having hastened the execution; it was not he, he replies: a\r\n    man who is now dead told him that orders had been given to\r\n    hasten it.\"\r\n\r\nThe Duc de Rovigo is not well inspired on the subject of the execution,\r\nwhich he describes as taking place in daylight; that would, besides,\r\nhave altered nothing in the fact, and would simply mean the absence of\r\na torch at the punishment.\r\n\r\n\"At the hour of sunrise, in the open air,\" asks the general, \"what\r\nneed was there for a lantern to see a man _at six paces!_ Not that\r\nthe sun,\" he adds, \"was altogether bright and clear; a fine rain had\r\nfallen all night, and a damp mist still retarded, in some degree, its\r\nappearance. The execution took place at six o'clock in the morning:\r\nthis fact is witnessed by irrefutable documents.\"\r\n\r\n*\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The execution.]\r\n\r\nBut the general neither produces these documents nor tells us where to\r\nfind them. The course of the trial shows that the Duc d'Enghien was\r\ntried at two o'clock in the morning and shot forthwith. Those words,\r\n\"two o'clock in morning,\" which originally appeared on the first\r\nminutes of the sentence, were subsequently erased from the minutes.\r\nThe official report of the exhumation proves, by the depositions of\r\nthree witnesses, Madame Bon, the Sieur Godard and the Sieur Bounelet\r\n(the latter had helped to dig the grave), that the death penalty was\r\neffected at night. M. Dupin the Elder records the circumstance of a\r\nlantern fastened over the Duc d'Enghien's heart to serve as a mark, or\r\nheld, with the same object, in the Prince's firm hand. Stories were\r\ntold of a heavy stone taken from the grave with which the victim's head\r\nwas crushed in. Lastly, the Duc de Rovigo is supposed to have boasted\r\nof possessing some of the spoils of the sacrifice; I myself have\r\nbelieved in these rumours; but the legal documents prove that they were\r\nunfounded.\r\n\r\nFrom the official report, dated Wednesday the 20th of March 1816,\r\nof the physicians and surgeons entrusted with the exhumation of the\r\ncorpse, it has been certified that the skull was broken, that \"the\r\nupper jaw, separated entirely from the facial bones, contained twelve\r\nteeth; that the lower jaw, fractured in the middle, was divided in two,\r\nand showed only three teeth.\"\r\n\r\nThe body was lying flat upon its abdomen, the head being lower than the\r\nfeet; there was a gold chain around the vertebrae of the neck.\r\n\r\nThe second official report of the exhumation (of the same date, 20\r\nMarch 1816), \"the general report,\" states that with the remains of the\r\nskeleton were found a purse in morocco-leather containing eleven pieces\r\nof gold, seventy pieces of gold enclosed in sealed rolls, some hair,\r\nshreds of clothing, remnants of his cap bearing marks of the bullets by\r\nwhich it had been pierced.\r\n\r\nM. de Rovigo therefore took none of the spoils; the earth which had\r\nheld them has restored them, and has borne witness to the general's\r\nhonesty; no lantern was fastened over the Prince's heart, its\r\nfragments would have been found, as were those of the perforated cap;\r\nno heavy stone was taken from the grave; the fire of the piquet _at six\r\npaces_ was enough to blow the head to pieces, to \"separate the upper\r\njaw from the facial bones,\" and so on.\r\n\r\nTo complete this mockery of human vanities were needed only the similar\r\nimmolation of Murat, the Governor of Paris, the death of Bonaparte in\r\ncaptivity, and the inscription engraved upon the Duc d'Enghien's coffin:\r\n\r\n\"Here lies the _body_ of the most high and mighty Prince of the Blood,\r\nPeer of France, _died_ at Vincennes, 21 March 1804; aged 31 years, 7\r\nmonths and 19 days.\"\r\n\r\nThe \"body\" was mere bare and shattered bones; the \"high and mighty\r\nPrince,\" the broken fragments of a soldier's carcase; not a word to\r\nrecall the catastrophe, not a word of blame or grief in this epitaph\r\ncarved by a sorrowing family; a prodigious result of the respect which\r\nthe century shows to the works and susceptibilities of the Revolution!\r\nIn the same way, no time was lost in removing all traces of the\r\nmortuary chapel of the Duc de Berry.\r\n\r\nWhat a sum total of annihilation! Bourbons, who returned to so little\r\npurpose to your palaces, you have busied yourselves with naught save\r\nexhumations and funerals: your time of life was passed. God has willed\r\nit so! The ancient glory of France perished beneath the eyes of the\r\nshade of the Great Condé, in a moat at Vincennes: perhaps at the very\r\nplace where Louis IX., \"to whom men resorted as to a saint.... seated\r\nhimself at the foot of an oak, and where all who had any business with\r\nhim came without ceremony and without hindrance from any usher or\r\nothers; and whenever he heard anything that could be amended in the\r\nspeeches of those who pleaded for others he most graciously corrected\r\nit himself, and all the people who had a cause to bring before him\r\nstood round him[626].\"\r\n\r\nThe Duc d'Enghien asked leave to speak to Bonaparte: \"he had a cause\r\nto bring before him;\" he was not heard! Who, standing at the edge\r\nof the ravelin, looked down into the moat upon those muskets, those\r\nsoldiers dimly lighted by a lantern in the mist and gloom, as in night\r\neverlasting? Where was the light placed? Did the Duc d'Enghien stand\r\nover his open grave? Was he obliged to step across it to place himself\r\nat the distance of \"six paces\" specified by the Duc de Rovigo.\r\n\r\nThere exists a letter written by M. le Duc d'Enghien, at the age of\r\nnine, to his father the Duc de Bourbon; he says:\r\n\r\n\"All the Enguiens[627] are _lucky_; the one[628] of the Battle of\r\nCerizoles, the one who won the Battle of Rocroi[629]: I hope to be so\r\ntoo.\"\r\n\r\nIs it true that the victim was refused a priest? Is it true that he\r\nonly with difficulty found a hand willing to convey to a woman a last\r\npledge of affection? What did the executioners care for sentiments of\r\nreligion or love? They were there to kill, the Duc d'Enghien to die.\r\n\r\nThe Duc d'Enghien had been secretly married, through the offices of\r\na priest, to the Princesse Charlotte de Rohan[630]: in those days of\r\na roving mother-land, a man, by the very reason of his elevation,\r\nwas impeded by a thousand political obstacles; to enjoy that which\r\nsociety accords to all, he was obliged to hide himself. This lawful\r\nmarriage, to-day no more a secret, enhances the splendour of a tragic\r\ndoom; it substitutes the glory for the clemency of Heaven: religion\r\nperpetuates the pomp of misfortune when, after the catastrophe has been\r\naccomplished, the cross rises on the deserted spot.\r\n\r\n*\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The Duc de Talleyrand.]\r\n\r\nM. de Talleyrand, according to M. de Rovigo's pamphlet, had presented\r\na vindicatory memorial to Louis XVIII.; this memorial, which I have\r\nnot seen, should have thrown light upon everything, and threw light\r\nupon nothing. In 1820, when I was appointed Minister Plenipotentiary\r\nto Berlin, I discovered in the archives of the embassy a letter from\r\n\"the Citizen Laforest[631],\" addressed to \"the Citizen Talleyrand,\"\r\non the subject of the Duc d'Enghien. This strongly-worded letter does\r\nits author the more credit in that he did not fear to compromise his\r\ncareer, without earning the reward of public opinion, since the step he\r\nhad taken was to remain unknown: a noble act of self-denial on the part\r\nof a man who, through his very obscurity, had relegated to obscurity\r\nthe good which he had done.\r\n\r\nM. de Talleyrand took his lesson, and kept silence; at least, I found\r\nnothing from him in the same archives concerning the death of the\r\nPrince. The Minister of Foreign Relations had nevertheless, on the 2\r\nVentôse, informed the Minister of the Elector of Baden \"that the First\r\nConsul had thought it necessary to order some detachments to proceed\r\nto Offenburg and Ettenheim, there to seize the instigators of the\r\nscandalous conspiracies which, by their character, place without the\r\npale of the Law of Nations all those who have manifestly taken part in\r\nthem.\"\r\n\r\nA passage from Generals Gourgaud[632], Montholon[633], and D. Ward,\r\nbrings Bonaparte upon the scene:\r\n\r\n    \"My Minister,\" says the latter, \"strongly represented to\r\n    me the need for seizing the Duc d'Enghien, although he was\r\n    upon neutral territory. But I continued to hesitate, and the\r\n    Prince de Bénévent twice brought me the order for his arrest\r\n    for signature. Nevertheless I consented to sign it only after\r\n    convincing myself of the urgency of this act.\"\r\n\r\nAccording to the _Mémorial de Sainte-Hélène_[634], the following words\r\nmust have dropped from Bonaparte:\r\n\r\n    \"The Duc d'Enghien bore himself before the tribunal with\r\n    great gallantry. On his arrival at Strasburg, he wrote me a\r\n    letter; this letter was handed to Talleyrand, who kept it\r\n    until the execution.\"\r\n\r\n*\r\n\r\nI have no great belief in this letter: Napoleon probably turned into a\r\nletter the request made by the Duc d'Enghien to speak to the conqueror\r\nof Italy, or rather the few lines expressing this request which, before\r\nsigning the examination undergone before the judge-advocate, the Prince\r\nhad written with his own hand. Nevertheless, the fact that this letter\r\nwas not to be found should not lead us too vigorously to conclude that\r\nit was never written:\r\n\r\n    \"I know,\" says the Duc de Rovigo, \"that in the early days\r\n    of the Restoration, in 1814, one of M. de Talleyrand's\r\n    secretaries was incessantly making researches in the archives\r\n    under the gallery of the Museum. I have this fact from the\r\n    man who received the order to pass him in. The same thing was\r\n    done at the repository of the War Office for the documents of\r\n    the trial of M. le Duc d'Enghien, of which only the sentence\r\n    remained.\"\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Talleyrand's complicity.]\r\n\r\nThe fact is true; all the diplomatic papers, and notably the\r\ncorrespondence of M. de Talleyrand with the \"Emperor\" and the \"First\r\nConsul,\" were transferred from the archives of the Museum to the house\r\nin the Rue Saint-Florentin[635]; part of them were destroyed; the\r\nremainder were put into a stove, to which they forgot to set light;\r\nthis was all that the Minister's prudence could do against the Prince's\r\nindifference. The documents that were not burned were recovered; some\r\none thought it was right to preserve them: I have held in my hands\r\nand read with my eyes a letter from M. de Talleyrand, dated 8 March\r\n1804, and treating of the arrest, not yet carried out, of M. le Duc\r\nd'Enghien. The Minister invites the First Consul to deal vigorously\r\nwith his enemies. I was not permitted to keep the letter, and I have\r\nretained only these two passages in my memory:\r\n\r\n    \"If justice obliges us to punish vigorously, policy exacts\r\n    that we should punish without exception.................... I\r\n    will suggest to the First Consul M. de Caulaincourt, to whom\r\n    he might give his orders, and who would execute them with as\r\n    much discretion as fidelity.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nWill this report of the Prince de Talleyrand one day be published in\r\nfull? I do not know; but what I do know is that it was in existence no\r\nmore than two years ago.\r\n\r\nThere was a meeting of the Council for the arrest of the Duc d'Enghien.\r\nCambacérès, in his unpublished Memoirs, declares, and I believe him,\r\nthat he opposed the arrest; but, while recording what he said, he does\r\nnot say what the others replied.\r\n\r\nFor the rest, the _Mémorial de Sainte-Hélène_ denies the entreaties\r\nfor mercy to which Bonaparte is said to have been exposed. The\r\npretended scene of Joséphine on her knees asking for pardon for the Duc\r\nd'Enghien, clinging to the skirt of her husband's coat and allowing\r\nthat inexorable husband to drag her about, is one of those melodramatic\r\ninventions with which our latter-day fabulists compose veracious\r\nhistory. Joséphine did not know, on the evening of the 19th of March,\r\nthat the Duc d'Enghien was to be judged; she only knew that he had\r\nbeen arrested. She had promised Madame de Rémusat to interest herself\r\nin the Prince's fate. As this lady was returning to the Malmaison\r\nwith Joséphine on the evening of the 19th, it was noticed that the\r\nfuture Empress, instead of being preoccupied solely with the perils of\r\nthe prisoner of Vincennes, frequently put her head to the window of\r\nthe carriage to look out at a general riding in her suite: a woman's\r\ncoquetry had carried elsewhere the thought which might have saved the\r\nDuc d'Enghien's life. It was not until the 21st of March that Bonaparte\r\nsaid to his wife:\r\n\r\n\"The Duc d'Enghien has been shot.\"\r\n\r\nThese Memoirs of Madame de Rémusat, whom I have known, contained\r\nextremely curious details on the inner life of the imperial Court. The\r\nauthor burnt them during the Hundred Days[636], and afterwards wrote\r\nthem anew: they are now no more than memories reproduced by memories;\r\ntheir colour has faded; but Bonaparte is throughout exposed to the\r\nlight and judged with impartiality.\r\n\r\nMen attached to Napoleon say that he knew of the death of the Duc\r\nd'Enghien only after the Prince's execution: this story would\r\nseem to derive some value from the anecdote related by the Duc de\r\nRovigo concerning Réal's going to Vincennes, if the anecdote were\r\ntrue[637]. Once the death had taken place through the intrigues of\r\nthe revolutionary party, Bonaparte recognised the accomplished fact,\r\nso as not to irritate men whom he thought powerful: this ingenious\r\nexplanation is not admissible.\r\n\r\n*\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Bonaparte's responsibility.]\r\n\r\nNow, to resume these facts, here is what they have proved to me:\r\nBonaparte wished the Duc d'Enghien's death; no one had made that death\r\na condition of his mounting the throne. To suppose this condition is\r\none of the subtleties of the politicians who claim to find occult\r\ncauses for everything. Nevertheless it is probable that certain\r\ncompromised persons did not without a certain pleasure see the First\r\nConsul sever himself for good from the Bourbons. The Vincennes sentence\r\nwas an instance of Bonaparte's violent temperament, an outburst of cold\r\nanger fed by the reports of his Minister.\r\n\r\nM. de Caulaincourt is guilty only of having executed the order for the\r\narrest.\r\n\r\nMurat has to reproach himself only with conveying general orders and\r\nwith not having had the strength to withdraw: he was not at Vincennes\r\nduring the trial.\r\n\r\nThe Duc de Rovigo found himself charged with the execution; he probably\r\nhad secret orders: General Hulin hints as much. What man would have\r\ndared to take upon himself to order the execution _forthwith_ of a\r\nsentence of death upon the Duc d'Enghien, if he had not acted on an\r\nimperative mandate?\r\n\r\nAs to M. de Talleyrand, priest and nobleman, he inspired and prepared\r\nthe murder by persistently alarming Bonaparte: he feared the return\r\nof the Legitimacy. It would be possible, by collecting what Napoleon\r\nsaid at St. Helena and the letters written by the Bishop of Autun,\r\nto prove that the latter took a very great part in the death of\r\nthe Duc d'Enghien. It would be vain to object that the Minister's\r\nlight-heartedness, character, and education ought to make him averse\r\nto violence, that his corruption ought to take away his energy; it\r\nwould remain none the less a fact that he persuaded the Consul to the\r\nfatal arrest. This arrest of the Duc d'Enghien on the 15th of March was\r\nnot unknown to M. de Talleyrand: he was in daily communication with\r\nBonaparte and conferred with him; during the interval that elapsed\r\nbetween the arrest and the execution, did M. de Talleyrand, he, the\r\ninstigating Minister, repent, did he say a single word to the First\r\nConsul in favour of the unhappy Prince? It is natural to believe that\r\nhe applauded the execution of the sentence.\r\n\r\nThe military commission sentenced the Duc d'Enghien, but with sorrow\r\nand repentance.\r\n\r\nThis, conscientiously, impartially and strictly considered, is the\r\nexact part played by each. My fate has been too closely connected with\r\nthis catastrophe that I should not endeavour to throw light upon its\r\ndark places and to lay bare its details. If Bonaparte had not killed\r\nthe Duc d'Enghien, if he had brought me closer and closer to him (and\r\nhis inclination prompted him to do so), what would have been the result\r\nfor me? My literary career would have been ended; I should at one\r\njump have entered the political career, in which I have proved what I\r\ncould have done by the Spanish War; and I should have become rich and\r\npowerful. France might have been the gainer by my association with the\r\nEmperor; I should have been the loser. Possibly I might have succeeded\r\nin maintaining some ideas of liberty and moderation in the great man's\r\nhead; but my life, ranking among those which are called happy, would\r\nhave been deprived of that which has constituted its character and its\r\nhonour: poverty, strife and independence.\r\n\r\n*\r\n\r\nLastly, the principal accused rises after all the others; he brings\r\nup the rear of the blood-stained penitents. Suppose that a judge\r\nwere to have brought up before him \"the man named Bonaparte,\" as\r\nthe captain-judge-advocate had brought up before him \"the man named\r\nd'Enghien;\" suppose that the minutes of the later examination copied\r\nupon the former had been preserved to us; compare and read:\r\n\r\n_Asked_: His surname and Christian names?\r\n\r\n_Answered_: That his name was Napoleon Bonaparte.\r\n\r\n_Asked_: Where he had resided since he had left France?\r\n\r\n_Answered_: At the Pyramids, in Berlin, Madrid, Vienna, Moscow, St\r\nHelena.\r\n\r\n_Asked_: What rank he filled in the army?\r\n\r\n_Answered_: Commander in the advance-guard of the armies of God. No\r\nother reply issues from the prisoner's lips.\r\n\r\n*\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Bonaparte defended.]\r\n\r\nThe different actors in the tragedy mutually accused each other:\r\nBonaparte alone throws the blame for it upon nobody; he preserves his\r\ngreatness beneath the weight of malediction; he does not bow his head\r\nbut stands erect; he exclaims with the stoic, \"Pain, I will never admit\r\nthat thou art an evil!\" But that which, in his pride, he refuses to\r\nadmit to the living he is constrained to confess to the dead. This\r\nPrometheus, with the vulture at his breast, who stole the fire from\r\nheaven, thought himself superior to all things, and he is compelled to\r\nreply to the Duc d'Enghien, whom he has made into dust before his time:\r\nthe skeleton, the trophy over which he stumbled, questions him and\r\ndominates him by a providential dispensation.\r\n\r\nPersonal attendance and the army, the ante-room and the tent had their\r\nrepresentatives at St. Helena: a servant, estimable for his fidelity to\r\nthe master he had chosen, had come to place himself near Napoleon as\r\nan echo at his service. Simplicity repeated the fable, while giving it\r\nan accent of sincerity. Bonaparte was \"Destiny;\" like the latter, he\r\ndeceived men's fascinated minds in _outward form_, but at the bottom of\r\nhis impostures this inexorable truth was heard to resound: \"I am!\" And\r\nthe universe felt its weight.\r\n\r\nThe author of the most credited work on St. Helena sets forth the\r\ntheory which Napoleon invented for the murderer's benefit; the\r\nvoluntary exile accepts as Gospel truth an homicidal talk, with\r\npretensions to profundity, which would only explain Napoleon's life as\r\nhe wished to arrange it, and as he contended that it should be written.\r\nHe left instructions for his neophytes: M. le Comte de Las Cases[638]\r\nlearnt his lesson without being aware of it; the stupendous captive,\r\nwandering along solitary paths, drew his credulous worshipper after him\r\nby means of lies, even as Hercules hung men to his mouth by chains of\r\ngold.\r\n\r\n*\r\n\r\n\"The first time,\" says the honest chamberlain, \"that I heard\r\nNapoleon pronounce the name of the Duc d'Enghien, I turned red with\r\nembarrassment. Fortunately I was walking behind him in a narrow path;\r\notherwise, he would certainly have observed my confusion. Nevertheless,\r\nwhen the Emperor for the first time developed the whole of this\r\nincident, with all its details and accessories; when he set forth\r\nhis various motives with his close, luminous, persuasive reasoning,\r\nI must confess that the matter seemed to me gradually to assume a\r\nnew aspect.... The Emperor often resumed this subject, which gave me\r\nan opportunity of observing in him certain very pronounced shades of\r\ncharacter. I was able on this occasion, and repeatedly, most distinctly\r\nto see in him the private individual struggling with the public man,\r\nand the natural sentiments of his heart contending against those of\r\nhis pride and of the dignity of his position. In the confidence of\r\nintimacy, he did not show himself indifferent to the unfortunate\r\nPrince's fate; but so soon as it became a question of the public, it\r\nwas quite a different thing. One day, after talking with me of the\r\nuntimely end and of the youth of this ill-fated man, he concluded by\r\nsaying:\r\n\r\n\"'And I have since learnt, my dear fellow, that he was rather in my\r\nfavour; I have been told that he spoke of me with some admiration; such\r\nis retributive justice here below!'\r\n\r\n\"And the last words were spoken with so much feeling, all the features\r\nof his face displayed such harmony with the words that, if he whom\r\nNapoleon was pitying had at that moment been in his power, I am quite\r\nsure that, whatever his intentions or his acts, he would have been\r\neagerly pardoned.... The Emperor used to consider this matter from two\r\nvery different points of view: that of common law, or the established\r\nrules of justice, and that of the law of nature, or acts of violence....\"\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: By the Comte de Las Cases.]\r\n\r\n    \"To us, in the intimacy of private conversation, the Emperor\r\n    would say that the blame in France might be ascribed to an\r\n    excess of zeal in those around him, or to private objects or\r\n    mysterious intrigues. He said that he had been precipitately\r\n    urged in this affair; that they had as it were taken his mind\r\n    unawares, hastened his measures, anticipated their result....\r\n\r\n    \"'Without doubt,' he said, 'if I had been informed in time\r\n    of certain particulars concerning the Prince's opinions and\r\n    disposition; more still, if I had seen the letter which\r\n    he wrote to me and which, God knows for what reason, was\r\n    not handed to me until after he was no more, I should most\r\n    certainly have pardoned him.'\r\n\r\n    \"It was easy for us to see that it was the Emperor's heart\r\n    and nature alone which dictated these words, and that they\r\n    were intended only for us; for he would have felt humiliated\r\n    to think that any one could for an instant believe that he\r\n    was trying to shift the burden from his own shoulders, or\r\n    condescending to justify himself; his fear in this respect,\r\n    or his susceptibility, was such that, in speaking of it to\r\n    strangers, or dictating on this matter for the public, he\r\n    confined himself to saying that, if he had known of the\r\n    Prince's letter, he would perhaps have pardoned him, in\r\n    view of the great political advantages which he could have\r\n    derived from it; and when, writing with his own hand his last\r\n    thoughts, which he concludes will be recorded in the present\r\n    age and reach posterity, he states, with reference to this\r\n    subject, which he regards as one of the most delicate for his\r\n    memory, that, if it were to be done over again, he would do\r\n    it again.\"\r\n\r\nThis passage, in so far as the writer is concerned, possesses all the\r\ncharacteristics of the most perfect sincerity; this shines through\r\nto the very phrase in which M. le Comte de Las Cases declared that\r\nBonaparte would have eagerly pardoned a man who was not guilty. But\r\nthe theories of the master are subtleties by aid of which an effort\r\nis made to reconcile the irreconcilable. In making the distinction\r\nbetween \"common law or established justice, and natural law or the\r\nerrors of violence,\" Napoleon seemed to be content with a piece of\r\nsophistry which in reality did not content him! He was unable to\r\nsubject his conscience as he had subjected the world. A weakness\r\nnatural to superior men and to little men, when they have committed\r\na fault, is to wish to represent it as a work of genius, a vast\r\ncombination beyond the understanding of the vulgar. Pride says those\r\nthings, and folly believes them. Bonaparte doubtless regarded as the\r\nmark of the ruling mind the sentence which he delivered in his great\r\nman's compunction: \"My dear fellow, such is retributive justice here\r\nbelow!\" O truly philosophical emotion! What impartiality! How well\r\nit justifies, by laying it to the charge of destiny, the evil which\r\nhas sprung from ourselves! A man nowadays thinks it an all-sufficient\r\nexcuse to exclaim, \"After all, it was my nature, it was the infirmity\r\nof mankind.\" When he has killed his father he repeats, \"I am made\r\nlike that!\" And the crowd stands open-mouthed, and they examine the\r\nmighty man's bumps, and they recognise that he was \"made like that.\"\r\nAnd what care I that you are made like that! Must I submit to this\r\nmanner of being? The world would be a fine chaos if all the men who are\r\n\"made like that\" were to take it into their heads to force themselves\r\none upon the other. Those who are unable to wipe out their errors\r\ndeify them: they make a dogma of their evil-doing, they turn acts of\r\nsacrilege into religion, and they would think themselves apostates were\r\nthey to renounce the cult of their iniquities.\r\n\r\n*\r\n\r\nThere is a serious lesson to be drawn from Bonaparte's life. Two\r\nactions, both bad, began and caused his fall: the death of the Duc\r\nd'Enghien and the war with Spain. It was vain for him to ride over them\r\nwith his glory: they remained there to ruin him. He perished on the\r\nvery side in which he thought himself strong, profound, invincible,\r\nwhen he violated the moral law while neglecting and scorning his real\r\nstrength, that is, his superior qualities of order and equity. So long\r\nas he confined himself to attacking anarchy and foreigners hostile to\r\nFrance, he was victorious; he found himself robbed of his vigour so\r\nsoon as he entered upon the paths of corruption: the shaving of the\r\nlocks by Delilah is nothing other than the loss of virtue. Every crime\r\nbears within itself a radical incapacity and a germ of misfortune: let\r\nus then practise good to be happy, and let us be just to be able.\r\n\r\nIn proof of this truth, observe that, at the very moment of the\r\nPrince's death, commenced the dissent which, growing in proportion\r\nto ill-fortune, decided the fall of the ordainer of the tragedy of\r\nVincennes. The Russian Cabinet, in reference to the arrest of the Duc\r\nd'Enghien, addressed vigorous representantions against the violation\r\nof the territory of the Empire: Bonaparte felt the blow, and replied in\r\nthe _Moniteur_ with a fulminating article bringing up the death of Paul\r\nI[639]. A funeral service had been celebrated in St. Petersburg for\r\nyoung Condé. On the cenotaph was read:\r\n\r\n\"To the Duc d'Enghien _quem devoravit bellua Corsica._\"\r\n\r\nThe two mighty adversaries subsequently became reconciled in\r\nappearance; but the mutual wound which policy had inflicted and\r\ninsult-enlarged remained in their hearts. Napoleon did not think\r\nhimself revenged until he came to sleep in Moscow; Alexander[640] was\r\nnot satisfied before he entered Paris.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: European indignation.]\r\n\r\nThe hatred of the Cabinet of Berlin arose from the same origin: I have\r\nspoken of the noble letter of M. de Laforest, in which he told M. de\r\nTalleyrand of the effect which the murder of the Duc d'Enghien had\r\nproduced at the Court of Potsdam. Madame de Staël was in Prussia when\r\nthe news from Vincennes arrived:\r\n\r\n    \"I was living in Berlin,\" he said, \"on the Spree Quay, and\r\n    my apartment was on the ground floor. At eight o'clock\r\n    one morning, they woke me to tell me that Prince Louis\r\n    Ferdinand[641] was under my windows on horse-back, and asked\r\n    me to come and speak to him....\r\n\r\n    \"'Do you know,' he asked, 'that the Duc d'Enghien has been\r\n    kidnapped on Baden territory, handed over to a military\r\n    commission, and shot within four-and-twenty hours after his\r\n    arrival in Paris?'\r\n\r\n    \"'What nonsense!' I replied. 'Do you not see that this can\r\n    only be a rumour spread by the enemies of France?'\r\n\r\n    \"In fact, I admit that my hatred of Bonaparte, strong as it\r\n    was, did not go so far as to make me credit the possibility\r\n    of his committing so great a crime.\r\n\r\n    \"'As you doubt what I tell you,' replied Prince Louis, 'I\r\n    will send you the _Moniteur_, in which you can read the\r\n    sentence.'\r\n\r\n    \"With these words he left me, and the expression of his\r\n    face was the presage of vengeance or death. A quarter of an\r\n    hour later, I had in my hands the _Moniteur_ of the 21st of\r\n    March (30 Pluviôse), which contained a sentence of death\r\n    passed by the military commission, sitting at Vincennes,\r\n    upon 'the man called Louis d'Enghien!' It was thus that\r\n    Frenchmen described the descendant of heroes who were the\r\n    glory of their country! Even if one were to abjure all the\r\n    prejudices in favour of illustrious birth which the return of\r\n    monarchical forms would necessarily recall, was it possible\r\n    thus to blaspheme the memories of the Battle of Lens[642]\r\n    and of Rocroi? This Bonaparte, who has won so many battles,\r\n    does not even know how to respect them; for him there is\r\n    neither past nor future; his imperious and scornful soul will\r\n    recognise nothing for opinion to hold sacred; he admits only\r\n    respect for the force in power. Prince Louis wrote to me,\r\n    beginning his note with these words: 'The man called Louis\r\n    of Prussia begs Madame de Staël,' etc. He felt the insult\r\n    offered to the Blood Royal whence he sprang, to the memory of\r\n    the heroes among whom he was longing to enroll himself. How,\r\n    after this horrible deed, could a single king in Europe ally\r\n    himself with such a man? Necessity, you will say. There is a\r\n    sanctuary in the soul to which its empire may not penetrate;\r\n    were this not so, what would virtue be upon this earth? A\r\n    liberal amusement, suited only to the peaceful leisure of\r\n    private men[643].\"\r\n\r\n\r\nThis resentment on the part of the Prince, for which he was to pay with\r\nhis life, was still lasting when the Prussian Campaign opened in 1806.\r\nFrederic William, in his manifesto of the 9th of October, said:\r\n\r\n\"The Germans have not revenged the death of the Duc d'Enghien; but the\r\nmemory of that crime will never fade among them.\"\r\n\r\nThese historical particulars, rarely observed, deserved to be so;\r\nfor they explain enmities of which one would be puzzled to discover\r\nthe primary cause elsewhere, and at the same time they disclose the\r\nsteps by which Providence leads a man's destiny from the crime to the\r\nexpiation.\r\n\r\n*\r\n\r\nHappy, at least, my life, which was not troubled by fear, nor attacked\r\nby contagion, nor carried away by examples! The satisfaction which I\r\nexperience to-day at what I did then is my warrant that my conscience\r\nis no illusion. More content than all those potentates, than all those\r\nnations fallen at the feet of the glorious soldier, I turn again\r\nwith pardonable pride to this page, which I have retained as my only\r\nbelonging and which I owe only to myself. In 1807, with my heart still\r\nmoved by the murder which I have just related, I wrote the following\r\nlines; they caused the _Mercure_ to be suppressed, and jeopardized my\r\nliberty once more:\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: I utter my protest.]\r\n\r\n    \"When, amid the silence of abjection, no sound is heard\r\n    save that of the chains of the slave and the voice of the\r\n    informer; when all tremble before the tyrant, and when\r\n    it is as dangerous to incur his favour as to deserve his\r\n    displeasure, the historian appears, entrusted with the\r\n    vengeance of the nations. Nero prospers in vain, Tacitus\r\n    already is born within the Empire; he grows up unknown beside\r\n    the ashes of Germanicus, and already a just Providence has\r\n    surrendered to an obscure child the glory of the master of\r\n    the world. If the historian's part is fine, it is often\r\n    dangerous; but there are altars such as that of honour which,\r\n    although deserted, demand further sacrifices: the god is\r\n    not annihilated because the temple is empty. Wherever there\r\n    remains a chance for fortune, there is no heroism in trying\r\n    it; magnanimous actions are those of which adversity and\r\n    death are the foreseen result After all, what do reverses\r\n    matter, if our name, pronounced by posterity, makes one\r\n    generous heart beat two thousand years after our life[644]?\"\r\n\r\nThe death of the Duc d'Enghien, by introducing a new principle into\r\nBonaparte's conduct, marred the correctness of his intelligence: he\r\nwas obliged to adopt as a shield maxims of which he had not the whole\r\nforce at his disposal, for his glory and his genius incessantly blunted\r\nthem. He was looked upon with suspicion, with fear; men lost confidence\r\nin him and in his destiny; he was constrained to see, if not to seek\r\nout, men whom he would never have seen, and who, through his action,\r\nconsidered themselves to have become his equals: the contagion of\r\ntheir defilement was overtaking him. His great qualities remained the\r\nsame, but his good dispositions became impaired and no longer upheld\r\nhis great qualities: under the influence of the corruption of that\r\noriginal stain his nature deteriorated. God commanded his angels to\r\ndisturb the harmonies of that world, to change its laws, to tilt it on\r\nits poles. As Milton says:\r\n\r\n                      They with labour push'd\r\n    Oblique the centric Globe: some say, the Sun\r\n    Was bid turn reins from th' equinoctial road\r\n    Like distant breadth.   .     .     .     .\r\n    .     .     .     .     .     .     .     .\r\n    Boreas and Cæcias and Argestes loud\r\n    And Thrascias rend the woods, and seas upturn[645].\r\n\r\nWill the ashes of Bonaparte be exhumed, as were those of the Duc\r\nd'Enghien? If I had been the master, the latter victim would still\r\nbe sleeping unhonoured in the moat of Vincennes Castle. That\r\n\"excommunicated one\" would have been left, like Raymond of Toulouse,\r\nin an open coffin; no man's hand would have dared to conceal beneath\r\na plank the sight of the witness to the incomprehensible judgments\r\nand angers of God. The abandoned skeleton of the Duc d'Enghien and\r\nNapoleon's deserted tomb at St Helena would be the counterpart of each\r\nother: there would be nothing more commemorative than those remains,\r\nface to face, at opposite ends of the earth.\r\n\r\nAt least the Duc d'Enghien did not remain on foreign soil, like the\r\nexiled of kings: the latter took care to restore the former to his\r\ncountry, a little harshly, it is true; but will it be for ever? France\r\n(how much dust winnowed by the breath of the Revolution bears witness\r\nto it) is not faithful to the bones of the dead. Old Condé, in his\r\nwill, declares \"that he is not sure which country he will be inhabiting\r\non the day of his death.\" O Bossuet, what would you not have added to\r\nthe masterpiece of your eloquence, if, when you were speaking over the\r\ngrave of the Great Condé, you had been able to foresee the future!\r\n\r\n*\r\n\r\nIt was at this very spot, at Chantilly, that the Duc d'Enghien\r\nwas born: \"Louis Antoine Henri de Bourbon, born 2 August 1772, at\r\nChantilly,\" says the sentence of death. It was on this lawn that\r\nhe played in childhood; the traces of his footsteps have become\r\nobliterated. And the victor of Friburg, of Nördlingen, of Lens, of\r\nSenef, where has he gone with his \"victorious and now feeble hands\"?\r\nAnd his descendants, the Condé of Johannisberg and of Bentheim[646],\r\nand his son, and his grandson, where are they? That castle, those\r\ngardens, those fountains \"which were silent neither by day nor by\r\nnight:\" what has become of them? Mutilated statues, lions with a claw\r\nor a jaw restored; trophies of arms sculptured in a crumbling wall;\r\nescutcheons with obliterated fleurs-de-lis; foundations of razed\r\nturrets; a few marble coursers above the empty stables no longer\r\nlivened by the neighing of the steed of Rocroi; near a riding-school,\r\na high unfinished gate: that is what remains of the memories of\r\nan heroic race; a will tied with a rope changed the owners of the\r\ninheritance[647].\r\n\r\nThe whole forest has repeatedly fallen under the axe. Persons of bygone\r\ntimes have run over those once resounding chases, mute to-day. What was\r\ntheir age, what their passions, when they stopped at the foot of those\r\noaks? O my useless Memoirs, I should not now be able to say to you:\r\n\r\n    Qu'à Chantilly Condé vous lise quelquefois;\r\n    Qu'Enghien en soit touché[648]!\r\n\r\nObscure men that we are, what are we beside those famous men?

On the 18th of March\r\n1808, forced by the revolt of Aranjuez, he abdicated in favour of his\r\nson Ferdinand. Napoleon compelled him to withdraw this abdication and\r\nto make a fresh one in favour of himself (5 May 1808), after which\r\nNapoleon's brother Joseph was placed on the throne of Spain. Charles\r\nIV. was sent to Compiègne and Marseilles, and died in Rome in 1819. On\r\nthe fall of Joseph, in 1813, Charles's son Ferdinand VII. ascended the\r\nthrone.--T.\r\n\r\n[597] Gustavus IV. (1778-1837) was the last Legitimist King of Sweden.\r\nA revolt of the nobles in 1809 compelled him to abdicate, and his\r\nuncle, the Duke of Sudermania, was proclaimed King with the title of\r\nCharles XIII., ultimately adopting General Bernadotte as his heir.\r\nGustavus spent the remaining years of his life in Germany, Holland, and\r\nSwitzerland, under the names of Count of Holstein-Gottorp and Colonel\r\nGustawson.

She poisoned\r\nClaudius to secure the Empire for Nero, her son by her first husband,\r\nand was herself murdered by Nero's orders in 59.--T.\r\n\r\n[603] The Duc de Bourbon was the Due d'Enghien's father, not his\r\ngrandfather. The grandfather was the Prince de Condé, the writer of the\r\nletter in question. Chateaubriand's mistake is due to a slip of the\r\npen, which we occasionally find in more than one other historian of the\r\nperiod.--B.\r\n\r\n[604] Pierre François Comte Réal (1765-1834) was an attorney at the\r\nChâtelet at the outbreak of the Revolution. He attached himself to\r\nDanton and became Public Accuser and Solicitor to the Commune of Paris.\r\nHe was imprisoned by Robespierre and released on the 9 Thermidor.\r\nBonaparte made him a State Councillor and appointed him a deputy at the\r\nMinistry of Police. In 1804 Réal discovered the conspiracy of Georges\r\nCadoudal. He was made Prefect of Police during the Hundred Days, and\r\nwas exiled under the Second Restoration. He returned to Paris in\r\n1818.--T.\r\n\r\n[605] Jean Jacques Régis de Cambacérès (1753-1824), an eminent jurist\r\nand a moderate revolutionary, who voted for the reprieve at the trial\r\nof Louis XVI. He was Minister of Justice under the Directory. Bonaparte\r\nchose him as Second Consul in 1799, with Lebrun as Third Consul. When\r\nNapoleon became Emperor he appointed Cambacérès Arch-chancellor and\r\ncreated him a Prince of the Empire and Duke of Parma. Cambacérès is\r\nresponsible for the greater portion of the Code civil. He was exiled by\r\nthe Bourbons and recalled in 1818.--T.\r\n\r\n[606] In the morning.--_Author's Note._\r\n\r\n[607] Madame Joséphine Bonaparte (1763-1814), _née_ Tascher de La\r\nPagerie, and widow of Alexandre Vicomte de Beauharnais, who was\r\nguillotined in 1794.

At the\r\nbattle of Marengo (14 June 1800) he was aide-de-camp to General Desaix,\r\nand was by his side when that general was shot through the heart. He\r\nbecame a general of brigade in 1803, a general of division in 1805, a\r\nduke in 1808, and succeeded Fouché as Minister of Police in 1810. He\r\nfollowed the Emperor on to the _Bellérophon_ in 1815, but was separated\r\nfrom him and kept a prisoner for seven months in Malta, where he drew\r\nup the plan of his Memoirs (published in 1828). On the Restoration,\r\nhe was sentenced to death in his absence. He returned to France in\r\n1819 in order to obtain the quashing of the sentence. A pamphlet\r\nwhich he subsequently wrote upon the death of the Duc d'Enghien,\r\naccusing Talleyrand of complicity, brought about his disgrace, and he\r\nwas obliged to retire to Rome. He returned once more to France after\r\nthe Revolution of 1830, and in 1831 received from Louis-Philippe the\r\ncommand-in-chief of the Army of Algiers, which he retained till his\r\ndeath in 1833.--T.\r\n\r\n[609] Claire Élisabeth Jeanne Comtesse de Rémusat (1780-1821), _née_\r\nGravier de Vergennes, wife of the Comte de Rémusat, Chamberlain to\r\nNapoleon and Superintendent of Theatres, and lady-in-waiting to the\r\nEmpress Joséphine.

He accompanied Bonaparte to Italy as\r\nAdjutant-General, was appointed Commander of Milan in 1797 and 1798,\r\nand in 1803 became a general of division and Commander of the Consular\r\nGuard. He took part in the several German campaigns, and was selected\r\nfor the command of the places around Vienna and of Berlin (1806). He\r\nwas at the head of the armed forces in Paris when the Malet conspiracy\r\nbroke out in 1812, and caused the plot to fail, having his lower\r\njaw shattered by Malet with a pistol-shot. Hulin lost the command\r\nof the City of Paris on the return of the Bourbons, and was obliged\r\nto leave France in 1816. He returned in 1819, and ended his days in\r\nretirement.--T.\r\n\r\n[615] Marie Louise Empress of the French (1791-1847), daughter of\r\nFrancis I.

He resigned the latter post in order to dissociate\r\nhimself from the decrees confiscating the possessions of the Orleans\r\nFamily; but resumed it five years later when summoned to the Imperial\r\nSenate. He had been a member of the French Academy since 1832. The\r\npamphlet to which Chateaubriand refers was published in 1823, and\r\nentitled, _Pièces judiciaires et historiques relatives au procès du\r\nduc dEnghien, avec le Journal de ce prince depuis l'instant de son\r\narrestation; précédées de la Discussion des actes de la commission\r\nmilitaire instituée en l'an XII, par le gouvernement consulaire, pour\r\njuger le duc d'Enghien, par l'auteur de l'opuscule intitulé: \"De la\r\nLibre Défense des accusés._\"--B.\r\n\r\n[618] An allusion to the abominable reply said to have been made to M.\r\nle Duc d'Enghien.--_Author's Note._\r\n\r\nThe Duke is reported to have cried, \"Shoot straight, my friends,\" to\r\nthe soldiers about to fire their volley.\r\n\r\n\"You have no friends here,\" replied the officer in command!--T.\r\n\r\n[619] General Claude François de Malet (1754-1812) played a\r\ndistinguished part in the campaigns of the Revolution, became a general\r\nof brigade in 1799, and was appointed Governor of Pavia by Masséna\r\nin 1805. His republicanism, however, made him suspect in the eyes of\r\nNapoleon, who had him imprisoned in Paris in 1808. Availing himself\r\nof the facilities awarded him by his transfer to a mad-house, he\r\norganized a conspiracy against the Empire, involving Generals Guidal\r\nand Lahorie in the plot. He escaped from prison on the night of the\r\n23rd of October 1812, rapidly visited the Paris barracks, spreading the\r\nnews of Napoleon's death, and was on the point of succeeding, when the\r\nresistance of General Hulin, who was at the head of the Staff, caused\r\nthe whole plot to fail.

Under the Second Restoration, he was sent\r\nas Minister Plenipotentiary to various Powers. He was made a peer of\r\nFrance in 1819, and a minister of State and privy councillor in 1825.\r\nHe lost his places and dignities at the Revolution of 1830.--B.\r\n\r\n[632] Gaspard Baron Gourgaud (1783-1852), a distinguished artillery\r\nofficer who had twice saved Napoleon's life, at Moscow and Brienne. He\r\naccompanied Napoleon to St. Helena, where he remained until 1817, and\r\nwhere he wrote the _Campagne de 1815_, published in 1818, which was\r\nthe cause of his being struck off the roll of the French army by Louis\r\nXVIII. Louis-Philippe reinstated him and made him his aide-de-camp,\r\nand in 1840 he accompanied the Prince de Joinville to St. Helena to\r\nbring back the remains of Napoleon. On his return, he was raised\r\nto the peerage. Gourgaud is part-author, together with Montholon,\r\nof the _Mémoires pour servir à l'histoire de France sous Napoléon_\r\n(1823-1825), from which the above quotation is taken.--T.\r\n\r\n[633] Charles Tristan Comte de Montholon (1782-1853), Gourgaud's\r\ncollaborator, was one of Napoleon's bravest and most reckless officers.\r\nHe too accompanied Napoleon to St Helena, remained with him to the day\r\nof his death, and was one of his executors and the depositary of his\r\nmanuscripts, which were subsequently published in eight volumes under\r\nthe title given in the preceding note. In 1840, Montholon took part\r\nin Louis Napoleon's futile descent at Boulogne, and suffered a short\r\nconfinement.--T.\r\n\r\n[634] LAS CASES, _Mémorial de Sainte-Hélène_ (8 volumes, 1822-1824).--T.\r\n\r\n[635] Talleyrand's residence.--T.\r\n\r\n[636] Lest they should compromise her friends.

I was approaching the barriers, when I met\r\nM. Réal going to Vincennes in the dress of a councillor of State. I\r\nstopped him to ask him where he was going:\r\n\r\n\"'To Vincennes,' he replied; 'I received orders yesterday to repair\r\nthere to examine the Duc d'Enghien.'\r\n\r\n\"I told him what had just happened, and he appeared as much astonished\r\nat what I had told him as I at what he had told me. I began to ponder.\r\nMy meeting with the Minister of Foreign Relations at General Murat's\r\nrecurred to my mind, and I began to doubt whether the death of the Duc\r\nd'Enghien was the work of the First Consul.\"--B.\r\n\r\n[638] Emmanuel Augustin Dieudonné Comte de Las Cases (1766-1842) was\r\na lieutenant in the navy when he emigrated in 1789 and joined Condé's\r\nArmy. He returned to France after the 18 Brumaire, and devoted himself\r\nfor several years to literary work, until in 1809 he enlisted as a\r\nvolunteer to assist in repelling the English, who were threatening\r\na descent upon Flushing. He attracted the notice of Napoleon, who\r\nmade him one of his chamberlains, and he was one of the four men who\r\nfollowed Napoleon into exile. He remained eighteen months at St.\r\nHelena, gathering the talk that fell from Napoleon's lips into his\r\nfamous _Mémorial de Sainte-Hélène_; but losing favour with Sir Hudson\r\nLowe, he was removed from Napoleon's service, taken to the Cape of\r\nGood Hope, and thence to Europe, where he was kept for some time in\r\nconfinement. Las Cases was not allowed to return to France until after\r\nthe Emperor's death. In 1830 he was returned for the Seine to the\r\nChamber of Deputies, where he sat in the Opposition.--T.\r\n\r\n[639] Paul I. Emperor of Russia (1754-1801), son of Catherine II. and\r\nPeter III.

The little house which I hired was occupied later by\r\nM. De Lally-Tolendal and Madame Denain, his \"best-beloved,\" as they\r\nsaid in the days of Diane de Poitiers[650]. My garden abutted on a\r\ntimber-yard, and near my window I had a tall poplar-tree, which M. de\r\nLally-Tolendal, in order to breathe a less moist air, himself felled\r\nwith his coarse hand, which to his eyes was transparent and fleshless:\r\nit was an illusion like any other. The pavement of the street at that\r\ntime came to an end before my door; higher up, the street or road wound\r\nacross a piece of waste-land called the Butte-aux-Lapins, or Rabbit\r\nHill. The Butte-aux-Lapins, sprinkled with a few isolated houses,\r\njoined on the right the Jardin de Tivoli, whence I had set out with my\r\nbrother for the emigration, and on the left the Parc de Monceaux. I\r\nstrolled pretty often in that abandoned park, where the Revolution had\r\ncommenced among the orgies of the Duc d'Orléans: this retreat had been\r\nembellished with marble nudities and mock ruins, a symbol of the light\r\nand vicious policy which was about to cover France with prostitutes and\r\nwreckage.\r\n\r\nI busied myself with nothing: at the utmost I conversed in the park\r\nwith some pine-trees, or talked of the Duc d'Enghien with three rooks\r\nat the edge of an artificial river hidden beneath a carpet of green\r\nmoss. Deprived of my Alpine Legation and of my Roman friendships, even\r\nas I had been suddenly separated from my attachments in London, I did\r\nnot know how to dispose of my imagination and my feelings; I sent them\r\nevery evening after the sun, and its rays were unable to carry them\r\nover the seas. I returned indoors and tried to fall asleep to the sound\r\nof my poplar tree.\r\n\r\nNevertheless my resignation had increased my reputation; in France a\r\nlittle courage always looks well. Some of the members of Madame de\r\nBeaumont's former company introduced me to new country-houses.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The Tocqueville family.]\r\n\r\nM. de Tocqueville[651], my brother's brother-in-law, and guardian\r\nof my two orphaned nephews, occupied Madame de Senozan's[652]\r\ncountry-seat[653]. On every hand were scaffold legacies. There I saw\r\nmy nephews grow up with their three Tocqueville cousins, among whom\r\nAlexis[654], the author of the _Démocratie en Amérique_, was prominent.\r\nHe was more spoilt at Verneuil than I had been at Combourg. Is this the\r\nlast renown that I shall have seen unknown in its swaddling clothes?\r\nAlexis de Tocqueville has travelled through the civilized America, of\r\nwhich I have travelled through the forests.\r\n\r\nVerneuil has changed masters; it has become the property of Madame\r\nde Saint-Fargeau, famous through her father[655] and through the\r\nRevolution, which adopted her as its daughter.\r\n\r\nNear Mantes, at the Ménil[656], was Madame de Rosanbo: my nephew, Louis\r\nde Chateaubriand, eventually married Mademoiselle d'Orglandes there,\r\nniece to Madame de Rosanbo; the latter no longer airs her beauty around\r\nthe pond and under the beeches of the manor: it has passed. When I went\r\nfrom Verneuil to the Ménil, I came to Mézy[657] on the road: Madame\r\nde Mézy was romance wrapped up in virtue and maternal grief. If only\r\nher child, which fell from a window and broke its head, had been able,\r\nlike the young quails which we shot, to fly over the _château_ and take\r\nrefuge in the Île-Belle, the smiling island of the Seine: _Coturnix per\r\nstipulas pascens!_\r\n\r\nOn the other side of the Seine, not far from the Marais, Madame de\r\nVintimille had introduced me to Méréville[658]. Méréville was an\r\noasis created by the smile of a muse, but of one of those muses whom\r\nthe Gallic poets call \"the learned fairies.\" Here the adventures of\r\nBlanca[659] and of Velléda were read before fashionable generations\r\nwhich, falling one from the other like flowers, to-day listen to the\r\nwailing of my years.\r\n\r\nBy degrees my brain, wearying of rest in my Rue de Miromesnil, saw\r\nphantoms form before it in the distance. The _Génie du Christianisme_\r\ninspired me with the idea of proving that work by mixing Christian\r\nand mythological characters together. A shade which long afterwards I\r\ncalled Cymodocée sketched itself vaguely in my head; not one of its\r\nfeatures was fixed. Cymodocée once conceived, I shut myself up with\r\nher, as I always do with the daughters of my imagination; but, before\r\nthey have issued from the dreamy state and arrived from the banks\r\nof Lethe through the ivory portals, they often change their shape.\r\nIf I create them through love, I undo them through love, and the one\r\ncherished object which I, later, present to the light is the offspring\r\nof a thousand infidelities.\r\n\r\nI remained only a year in the Rue de Miromesnil, because the house was\r\nsold. I arranged with Madame la Marquise de Coislin[660], who let me\r\nthe top floor of her house on the Place Louis XV[661].\r\n\r\n*\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The Marquise de Coislin.]\r\n\r\nMadame de Coislin was a woman of the grandest air. She was nearly\r\neighty years of age, and her proud and domineering eyes bore an\r\nexpression of wit and irony. Madame de Coislin was in no way lettered,\r\nand took pride in the fact; she had passed through the Voltairean\r\nage without being aware of it; if she had conceived any idea of it\r\nwhatever, it was that of a time of a voluble middle-class. Not that she\r\never spoke of her birth; she was too great to make herself ridiculous:\r\nshe very well knew how to see \"small people\" without compromising\r\nher rank; but, after all, she was born of the Premier Marquis of\r\nFrance[662]. If she was descended from Drogon de Nesle, killed in\r\nPalestine in 1096; from Raoul de Nesle[663], the Constable, knighted\r\nby Louis IX.; from Jean II. de Nesle, Regent of France during the last\r\ncrusade of St. Louis, Madame de Coislin vowed that this was a stupidity\r\non the part of fate for which she ought not to be held responsible; she\r\nwas naturally of the Court, as others, more happy, are of the streets,\r\nas one may be a thorough-bred mare or a cab-hack: she could not help\r\nthis accident, and had no choice but to endure the ill with which\r\nHeaven had been pleased to afflict her.\r\n\r\nHad Madame de Coislin had relations with Louis XV.? She never owned so\r\nmuch to me: she admitted, however, that she had been very much loved,\r\nbut she pretended that she had treated the royal lover with the utmost\r\nharshness.\r\n\r\n\"I have seen him at my feet,\" she would say to me; \"he had charming\r\neyes, and his language was seductive. He offered one day to give me a\r\nporcelain dressing-table, like that which Madame de Pompadour had.\r\n\r\n\"'Oh, Sire,' cried I, 'then I must use it to hide under!'\"\r\n\r\nBy a singular chance I came across this dressing-table at the\r\nMarchioness Conyngham's in London; she had received it from George IV.,\r\nand showed it to me with amusing simplicity.\r\n\r\nMadame de Coislin occupied in her house a room opening under the\r\ncolonnade corresponding to the colonnade of the Wardrobe. Two\r\nsea-pieces by Vernet[664], which Louis \"the Well-beloved\" had given to\r\nthe noble dame, were hung up on an old green satin tapestry. Madame\r\nde Coislin remained lying till two o'clock in the afternoon in a\r\nlarge bed, with curtains also of green silk, seated and propped up by\r\npillows; a sort of nightcap, badly fastened to her head, allowed her\r\ngrey hairs to escape. Sprigs of diamonds mounted in the old-fashioned\r\nway fell upon the shoulder-pieces of her bed-cloak, all covered with\r\nsnuff, as in the time of the fashionable ladies of the Fronde. Around\r\nher, on the bed-clothes, lay scattered the addresses of letters, torn\r\noff the letters themselves, and on these addresses Madame de Coislin\r\nwrote down her thoughts in every direction: she bought no stationery,\r\nthe post supplied her with it. From time to time a little dog called\r\nLili put her nose outside the sheets, came to bark at me for five or\r\nsix minutes, and crept back growling into her mistress' kennel. Thus\r\nhad time settled the young loves of Louis XV.\r\n\r\nMadame de Châteauroux[665] and her two sisters were cousins of Madame\r\nde Coislin; the latter would not have been of the humour, as was\r\nMadame de Mailly[666], repentant and a Christian, to reply to a man who\r\ninsulted her with a coarse name in the church of Saint-Roch:\r\n\r\n\"My friend, since you know me, pray to God for me.\"\r\n\r\nMadame de Coislin, miserly as are many people of wit, piled up her\r\nmoney in cupboards. She lived all devoured by a vermin of crown-pieces\r\nwhich clung to her skin; her servants relieved her. When I found\r\nher plunged in a maze of figures, she reminded me of the miser\r\nHermocrates[667], who, when dictating his will, appointed himself his\r\nown heir. Nevertheless she gave a dinner occasionally; but she would\r\nrail against coffee, which nobody liked, according to her, and which\r\nserved only to prolong the repast.\r\n\r\nMadame de Chateaubriand took a journey to Vichy with Madame de Coislin\r\nand the Marquis de Nesle; the marquis went on ahead, and had excellent\r\ndinners prepared. Madame de Coislin came after, and asked only for half\r\na pound of cherries. On leaving, she was presented with huge bills, and\r\nthen there was a terrible outcry. She would not hear of anything except\r\nthe cherries; the landlord maintained that, whether you ate or did not\r\neat, the custom was, at an inn, to pay for your dinner.\r\n\r\nMadame de Coislin had invented a form of illuminism to her own taste.\r\nCredulous and incredulous, she was led by her want of faith to laugh\r\nat those beliefs the superstition of which frightened her. She had met\r\nMadame de Krüdener; the mysterious Frenchwoman was illuminated only\r\nunder reserve; she did not please the fervent Russian, whom she herself\r\nliked no better. Madame de Krüdener said passionately to Madame de\r\nCoislin:\r\n\r\n\"Madame, who is your inside confessor?\"\r\n\r\n\"Madame,\" replied Madame de Coislin, \"I know nothing about my inside\r\nconfessor; I only know that my confessor is in the inside of his\r\nconfessional.\"\r\n\r\nThereupon the two ladies saw each other no more.\r\n\r\nMadame de Coislin prided herself on having introduced a novelty at\r\nCourt, the fashion of floating chignons, in spite of Queen Marie\r\nLeczinska[668], who was very pious and who opposed this dangerous\r\ninnovation. She held that formerly no genteel person would ever have\r\nthought of paying her doctor. Crying out against the plentifulness of\r\nwomen's linen:\r\n\r\n\"That smacks of the upstart,\" she said; \"we women of the Court had only\r\ntwo shifts: when they were worn out, we renewed them; we were dressed\r\nin silk gowns, and we did not look like grisettes, like the young\r\nladies of nowadays.\"\r\n\r\nMadame Suard[669], who lived in the Rue Royale, had a cock whose\r\ncrowing annoyed Madame de Coislin. She wrote to Madame Suard:\r\n\r\n\"Madame, have your cock's throat cut.\"\r\n\r\nMadame Suard sent back the messenger with this note:\r\n\r\n\"Madame, I have the honour to reply to you that I shall not have my\r\ncock's throat cut.\"\r\n\r\nThe correspondence went no further. Madame de Coislin said to Madame de\r\nChateaubriand:\r\n\r\n\"Ah, my heart, what a time we live in! And yet it's that Panckoucke\r\ngirl, the wife of that member of the Academy[670], you know.\"\r\n\r\nM. Hennin[671], a former clerk at the Foreign Office, and as tedious\r\nas a protocol, used to scribble fat novels. One day he was reading a\r\ndescription to Madame de Coislin: a tearful and abandoned love-lorn\r\nwoman was mournfully fishing a salmon. Madame de Coislin, who was\r\ngrowing impatient, and who disliked salmon, interrupted the author and\r\nsaid with the serious air which made her so comical:\r\n\r\n\"Monsieur Hennin, could you not make that lady catch a different fish?\"\r\n\r\nThe stories which Madame de Coislin told could not be recollected,\r\nfor there was nothing in them; all lay in the pantomime, the accent,\r\nand the expression of the narrator: she never laughed. There was one\r\ndialogue between \"Monsieur and Madame Jacqueminot,\" the perfection\r\nof which surpassed everything. When, in the conversation between\r\nthe husband and wife, Madame Jacqueminot rejoined, \"But, _Monsieur\r\nJacqueminot!_\" the name was pronounced in such a tone that you were\r\nseized with immoderate laughter. Obliged to let this pass, Madame de\r\nCoislin gravely waited, taking snuff.\r\n\r\nReading in a newspaper of the death of several kings, she took off her\r\nspectacles, and blowing her nose, said:\r\n\r\n\"There is an epizootic among crowned cattle.\"\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Death of Madame de Coislin.]\r\n\r\nAt the moment when she was ready to breathe her last, they were\r\nmaintaining by her bedside that one succumbed only through letting\r\none's self go; that, if one paid great attention, and never lost sight\r\nof the enemy, one would not die at all.\r\n\r\n\"I believe it,\" she said; \"but I fear that something would distract me.\"\r\n\r\nShe expired.\r\n\r\nI went down to her room the next day; I found Monsieur[672] and Madame\r\nd'Avaray, her brother-in-law and sister, sitting before the fire-place,\r\nwith a little table between them, counting the louis in a bag which\r\nthey had taken from a hollow wainscoting. The poor dead woman was there\r\nin her bed, behind the half-closed curtains: she no longer heard the\r\nsound of the gold which ought to have awaked her, and which fraternal\r\nhands were counting.\r\n\r\nAmong the thoughts written down by the defunct on margins of printed\r\npaper and addresses of letters were some which were extremely\r\nbeautiful. Madame de Coislin showed me what remained of the Court of\r\nLouis XV. under Bonaparte and after Louis XVI., even as Madame de\r\nHoudetot had enabled me to see what still lingered, in the nineteenth\r\ncentury, of philosophic society.\r\n\r\n*\r\n\r\nIn the summer of the year 1805, I went to join Madame de Chateaubriand\r\nat Vichy, where Madame de Coislin had taken her, as I have said. I\r\ndid not find Jussac, Termes, Flamarens there, whom Madame de Sévigné\r\nhad \"before and behind her\" in 1677: they had been sleeping since one\r\nhundred and twenty and so many years. I left my sister, Madame de Caud,\r\nin Paris, where she had fixed her residence since the autumn of 1804.\r\nAfter a short stay at Vichy, Madame de Chateaubriand proposed that we\r\nshould travel, in order to be away for some time from the political\r\ntroubles.\r\n\r\nTwo little _Journeys_[673] which I then took in Auvergne and to Mont\r\nBlanc have been collected in my works. After an absence of thirty-four\r\nyears, I have lately received at Clermont, from men unacquainted with\r\nmy person, the reception usually shown to an old friend. He who has\r\nlong occupied himself with the principles which the human race enjoys\r\nin common has friends, brothers and sisters in every family; for, if\r\nman is thankless, humanity is grateful. To those who have connected\r\nthemselves with you through a kindly reputation, and who have never\r\nseen you, you are always the same; you have always the age which they\r\nascribed to you; their attachment, which is not disturbed by your\r\npresence, always beholds you young and beautiful, like the sentiments\r\nwhich they love in your writings.\r\n\r\nWhen I was a child, in my Brittany, and heard speak of Auvergne, I\r\nimagined it a very distant, very distant country, where one saw strange\r\nthings, where one could not go without great danger, and travelling\r\nunder the protection of the Blessed Virgin. I never meet without a\r\nsort of melting curiosity those little Auvergnats who go to seek their\r\nfortunes in this great world with a small deal chest. They have little\r\nbesides hope in their box, as they climb down their rocks: lucky are\r\nthey if they bring it back with them!\r\n\r\nAlas, Madame de Beaumont had not lain two years on the bank of the\r\nTiber when I trod her natal soil in 1805; I was at but a few leagues\r\nfrom that Mont Dore where she had come in search of the life which\r\nshe lengthened a little in order to reach Rome. Last summer, in 1838,\r\nI once more travelled through this same Auvergne. Between those two\r\ndates, 1805 and 1838, I can place the transformations which society has\r\nundergone around me.\r\n\r\nWe left Clermont and, on our way to Lyons, passed through Thiers\r\nand Roanne. This road, then little frequented, followed at intervals\r\nthe banks of the Lignon. The author of the _Astrée_[674], who is not\r\na great genius, nevertheless invented places and persons that live:\r\nsuch is the creative power of fiction, when it is appropriate to the\r\nage in which it appears. There is, moreover, something ingeniously\r\nfantastic in that resurrection of the nymphs and naiads who mingle with\r\nshepherds, ladies and knights: those different worlds go well together,\r\nand one is agreeably pleased with the fables of mythology united to the\r\nlies of fiction; Rousseau has related how he was taken in by d'Urfé.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Geneva.]\r\n\r\nAt Lyons, we again found M. Ballanche: he made the excursion to Geneva\r\nand Mont Blanc with us. He went wherever one took him, without having\r\nthe smallest business there. At Geneva, I was not received at the\r\ngate of the city by Clotilda, the betrothed of Clovis: M. de Barante,\r\nsenior[675], had become Prefect of the Léman. At Coppet, I went to see\r\nMadame de Staël: I found her alone, buried in her castle, which was\r\nbuilt round a melancholy court-yard. I spoke to her of her fortune and\r\nof her solitude as a precious means of independence and happiness: I\r\noffended her. Madame de Staël loved society; she looked upon herself\r\nas the most wretched of women, in an exile with which I should have\r\nbeen enchanted. Where in my eyes was the unhappiness of living on one's\r\nproperty with all the comforts of life? Where was the misfortune of\r\nenjoying fame, leisure, peace, in a sumptuous retreat within sight of\r\nthe Alps, in comparison with those thousands of breadless, nameless,\r\nhelpless victims, banished to all the corners of Europe, while their\r\nparents had perished on the scaffold? It is sad to be attacked by\r\nan ill which the crowd cannot understand. For the rest, that ill is\r\ntherefore only the more intense: it is not lessened by being confronted\r\nwith other ills; one is not judged by another's pain; that which\r\nafflicts the one rejoices the other; hearts have varied secrets,\r\nincomprehensible to other hearts. Let us deny none his sufferings; it\r\nis with sorrows as with countries: each man has his own.\r\n\r\nMadame de Staël called the next day on Madame de Chateaubriand at\r\nGeneva, and we left for Chamouny. My opinion on the scenery of the\r\nmountains caused it to be said that I was seeking to make myself\r\nsingular. It will be seen, when I come to speak of the Saint-Gothard,\r\nthat I have kept to my opinion. In the _Voyage au Mont-Blanc_ appears\r\na passage which I will recall as linking together the past events of\r\nmy life and the events of that same life then still future, and to-day\r\nalso past:\r\n\r\n    \"There is one circumstance alone in which it is true that the\r\n    mountains produce an oblivion of earthly troubles: that is\r\n    when one withdraws far from the world to consecrate himself\r\n    to religion. An anchorite devoting himself to the service\r\n    of mankind, a saint wishing to meditate in silence on the\r\n    greatness of God, may find peace and joy on desert rocks;\r\n    but it is not then the tranquillity of the spot that passes\r\n    into the soul of those solitaries: it is, on the contrary,\r\n    their soul that diffuses its serenity through the region of\r\n    storms....\r\n\r\n    \"There are mountains which I would still visit with extreme\r\n    pleasure: those, for instance, of Greece and Judæa. I should\r\n    like to go over the spots with which my new studies lead\r\n    me daily to occupy myself: I would gladly seek, upon the\r\n    Tabor and Taygetus, other colours and other harmonies, after\r\n    painting the unfamed mountains and unknown valleys of the New\r\n    World.\"\r\n\r\nThe last phrase foretold the voyage which, in fact, I performed in the\r\nnext year, 1806.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The Comte de Forbin.]\r\n\r\nOn our return to Geneva, without being able to see Madame de Staël\r\nagain at Coppet, we found the inns crammed. But for the cares of\r\nM. de Forbin[676], who arrived unexpectedly and procured us a bad\r\ndinner in a dark waiting-room, we should have left the birth-place of\r\nRousseau without eating. M. de Forbin was at that time in a state of\r\nbeatitude; he displayed in his looks the inner felicity with which he\r\nwas inundated; his feet did not touch the ground. Wafted on his talent\r\nand his blissfulness, he came down from the mountain as though from\r\nthe sky, with his close-fitting painter's jacket, his pallet on his\r\nthumb, his brushes in a quiver. A good fellow, nevertheless, although\r\nexcessively happy, preparing to imitate me one day, when I should\r\nhave made my voyage to Syria, wishing even to go as far as Calcutta,\r\nto make his loves return to him by an uncommon road, when they failed\r\nhim on the beaten track. His eyes showed a protecting pity: I was\r\npoor, humble, uncertain of myself, and I did not hold the hearts of\r\nprincesses in my mighty hands. In Rome, I have had the honour of\r\nreturning M. de Forbin his lake-side dinner; I had the merit of having\r\nbecome an ambassador. In these days one sees the poor devil whom one\r\nhas left that morning in the street turned into a king by evening.\r\n\r\nThe noble gentleman, a painter in right of the Revolution, began\r\nthat generation of artists who dress themselves up like sketches,\r\ngrotesques, caricatures. Some wear prodigious mustachioes: one would\r\nthink they were going to conquer the world; their brushes are halberds,\r\ntheir erasing-knives sabres: others have huge beards, and hanging or\r\npuffed-out hair; they smoke a cigar by way of vulcano. These \"cousins\r\nof the rainbow,\" as our old Régnier[677] says, have their heads filled\r\nwith deluges, seas, rivers, forests, cataracts, tempests, or else with\r\ncarnages, executions and scaffolds. In their rooms they have human\r\nskulls, foils, mandolines, morions, and dolmans. Bragging, pushing,\r\nuncivil, liberal (as far as the portrait of the tyrant whom they are\r\npainting), they endeavour to form a separate species between the\r\nape and the satyr; they are anxious to make it understood that the\r\nsecrecy of the studio has its dangers, and that there is no safety\r\nfor the models. But how handsomely do they not redeem these oddities\r\nby a fevered existence, a suffering and sensitive nature, an entire\r\nabnegation of self, an incalculable devotion to the miseries of others,\r\na delicate, superior, idealized manner of feeling, a poverty proudly\r\nwelcomed and nobly endured; lastly, sometimes by immortal talents: the\r\noffspring of work, passion, genius, and solitude!\r\n\r\nLeaving Geneva at night to return to Lyons, we were stopped at the foot\r\nof the Fort de l'Écluse, waiting for the gates to be opened. During\r\nthis stay of the witches in _Macbeth_ on the heath, strange things\r\npassed within me. My dead years came to life again and surrounded me\r\nlike a band of phantoms; my burning seasons returned to me in their\r\nflame and sadness. My life, hollowed out by the death of Madame de\r\nBeaumont, had remained empty: airy forms, houris or dreams, issuing\r\nfrom that abyss, took me by the hand and led me back to the days of\r\nthe sylph. I was no longer in the spot which I occupied, I dreamed of\r\nother shores. Some secret influence urged me to the regions of the\r\nDawn, whither I was drawn besides by the plan of my new work and the\r\nreligious voice which released me from the vow of the village woman,\r\nmy foster-mother. As all my faculties had extended, as I had never\r\nmisused life, it superabounded with the pith of my intelligence, and\r\nart, triumphing in my nature, added to the poet's inspirations. I had\r\nwhat the Fathers of the Thebaïde called \"ascensions\" of the heart.\r\nRaphael--forgive the blasphemy of the simile--Raphael, before the\r\nTransfiguration only sketched upon the easel, could not have been more\r\nelectrified by his master-piece than was I by Eudore and Cymodocée,\r\nwhose names I did not yet know and whose images I dimly saw through an\r\natmosphere of love and fame.\r\n\r\nThus does the native genius which tormented me in the cradle sometimes\r\nreturn on its steps after deserting me; thus are my former sufferings\r\nrenewed; nothing heals within me; if my wounds close instantly, they\r\nopen again suddenly like those of the crucifixes of the Middle Ages,\r\nwhich bleed on the anniversary of the Passion. I have no alternative,\r\nto obtain relief during these crises, but to give a free course to the\r\nfever of my thoughts, in the same way as one has his veins lanced when\r\nthe blood rushes to the heart or rises to the head. But of what am I\r\nspeaking! O religion, where then are thy powers, thy restraints, thy\r\nbalsams! Am I not writing all these things at a distance of countless\r\nyears from the hour at which I gave birth to René? I had a thousand\r\nreasons to believe myself dead, and I live! 'Tis a great pity. Those\r\nafflictions of the isolated poet, condemned to suffer the spring in\r\nspite of Saturn, are unknown to the man who does not go outside the\r\ncommon laws; for him the years are ever young:\r\n\r\n\"The young kids,\" says Oppian, \"watch over the author of their being;\r\nwhen he comes to fall into the huntsman's net, they offer him in their\r\nmouths the tender, flowering grass, which they have gone to gather from\r\nafar, and bring him in their lips fresh water, drawn from the adjacent\r\nbrook[678].\"\r\n\r\n*\r\n\r\nOn my return from Lyons I found letters from M. Joubert: they informed\r\nme that it was not possible for him to be at Villeneuve before\r\nSeptember. I replied:\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Lyons and M. Saget.]\r\n\r\n    \"Your departure from Paris is too remote and distresses me;\r\n    you well know that my wife will never consent to arrive at\r\n    Villeneuve before you: she has a head of her own, and since\r\n    she has been with me, I find myself at the head of two heads\r\n    very difficult to govern. We shall remain at Lyons, where\r\n    they make us eat so prodigiously that I hardly have the\r\n    courage to leave this excellent town. The Abbé de Bonnevie is\r\n    here, back from Rome; he is wonderfully well; he is merry, he\r\n    preachifies, and no longer thinks of his woes; he embraces\r\n    you and will write to you. In short, everybody is in high\r\n    spirits, except myself; you are the only one to grumble. Tell\r\n    Fontanes that I have dined with M. Saget.\"\r\n\r\nThis M. Saget was the providence of the canons; he lived on the hill of\r\nSainte-Foix, in the district of the good wine. The way to his house led\r\nup near the spot where Rousseau had spent the night on the banks of the\r\nSaône:\r\n\r\n    \"I remember,\" he says, \"spending a delightful night outside\r\n    the town, on a road which skirted the Saône. Gardens raised\r\n    terrace-wise bordered the road on the opposite side: it had\r\n    been very warm that day; the evening was charming, the dew\r\n    moistened the parched grass; no wind, a quiet night; the\r\n    air was cool without being chill; the sun after setting\r\n    had left red vapours in the sky, and their reflection made\r\n    the water rose-coloured; the trees on the terraces were\r\n    laden with nightingales which replied one to the other. I\r\n    walked along in a sort of ecstasy, abandoning my senses and\r\n    my heart to the enjoyment of all this, and only sighing a\r\n    little with regret at enjoying it alone. Absorbed in my\r\n    sweet reverie, I prolonged my walk well into the night,\r\n    without perceiving that I was tired. I perceived it at last:\r\n    I lay down voluptuously on the shelf of a sort of niche or\r\n    false door, sunk into a terrace-wall; the canopy of my bed\r\n    consisted of the tops of the trees, a nightingale was exactly\r\n    over my head; I fell asleep to its singing: my slumbers were\r\n    sweet, my awakening even more so. It was broad day-light: my\r\n    eyes on opening beheld the water, the verdure, an admirable\r\n    landscape.\"\r\n\r\n*\r\n\r\nWith Rousseau's charming itinerary in one's hand, one arrived at M.\r\nSaget's. This ancient and lean bachelor, formerly married, wore a\r\ngreen cap, a grey camlet coat, nankeen pantaloons, blue stockings and\r\nbeaver shoes. He had lived long in Paris, and had been intimate with\r\nMademoiselle Devienne[679]. She wrote him very witty letters, scolded\r\nhim, and gave him very good advice: he ignored it, for he did not take\r\nthe world seriously, believing apparently, like the Mexicans, that\r\nthe world had already used four suns, and that at the fourth (which\r\nis lighting us at present) men had been changed into maggots. He did\r\nnot trouble his mind about the martyrdom of St. Pothin[680] and St.\r\nIreneus[681], nor of the massacre of the Protestants drawn up side by\r\nside by order of Mandelot[682], the Governor of Lyons, all of them\r\nhaving their throats cut on the same side. Opposite the field of the\r\nshooting at the Brotteaux[683], he would tell me details of it, while\r\nstrolling among his vines, mingling with his narrative verses of Loyse\r\nLabbé[684]: he would not have missed a single mouthful during the last\r\nmisfortunes of Lyons, under the Charte-Vérité.\r\n\r\nOn certain days a certain calf's head was served up at Sainte-Foix,\r\nafter being soused for five nights, boiled in madeira, and stuffed\r\nfull of exquisite things; very pretty peasant-girls waited at table;\r\nthey served excellent homegrown wine out of demi-johns the size of\r\nthree bottles. We swooped upon the Saget banquet, I and the cassocked\r\nchapter: the hill-side was quite black with us.\r\n\r\nOur _dapifer_ soon came to the end of his provisions: in the ruin of\r\nhis last moments he was taken in by two or three of the old mistresses\r\nwho had plundered his life, \"a kind of women,\" says St. Cyprian[685],\r\n\"who live as though they could be loved: _quæ sic vivis ut possis\r\nadamari._\"\r\n\r\n\r\n*\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The Grande Chartreuse.]\r\n\r\nWe tore ourselves from the delights of Capua to go and see the\r\nChartreuse, still accompanied by M. Ballanche. We hired a calash whose\r\ndisjointed wheels made a lamentable noise. On reaching Voreppe we\r\nstopped at an inn at the top of the town. The next morning, at break of\r\nday, we mounted on horseback and set out preceded by a guide. At the\r\nvillage of Saint-Laurent, at the bottom of the Grande-Chartreuse, we\r\ncrossed the threshold of the valley, and passing between two walls of\r\nrocks, followed the road leading up to the monastery. When speaking of\r\nCombourg, I have told you what I experienced in that spot. The deserted\r\nbuildings were cracking under the supervision of a kind of farmer\r\nof the ruins. A lay-brother had remained to take care of an infirm\r\nsolitary who had just died: religion had imposed loyalty and obedience\r\nupon friendship. We saw the narrow grave freshly covered over: Napoleon\r\nwas just about to dig a huge one at Austerlitz. We were shown the\r\nconvent enclosure, the cells, each with its garden and workshop; we\r\nnoticed joiners' boards and turners' wheels: the hand had dropped the\r\nchisel. In a gallery were displayed the portraits of the superiors of\r\nthe Chartreuse. The ducal palace at Venice preserves the series of the\r\n_ritratti_ of the doges: what different spots and memories! Higher\r\nup, at some distance, we were taken to the chapel of Le Sueur's[686]\r\nimmortal recluse[687].\r\n\r\nAfter dining in an immense kitchen, we set out again and met, carried\r\nin a palanquin like a rajah, M. Chaptal, formerly an apothecary, then a\r\nsenator, next owner of Chanteloup and inventor of beetroot sugar, the\r\ngreedy heir of the beautiful Indian reed-canes of Sicily, perfected by\r\nthe Otaheitan sun. As I descended from the forests, my thoughts turned\r\nto the cenobites of old; for centuries, they carried, together with a\r\nlittle earth, in the skirts of their gowns, fir plants which have grown\r\ninto trees on the rocks. Happy O ye who travelled noiselessly through\r\nthe world, nor even turned your heads in passing!\r\n\r\nNo sooner had we reached the entrance to the valley than a storm burst;\r\na deluge dashed down, and vexed torrents rushed roaring from every\r\nravine. Madame de Chateaubriand, becoming reckless for very fear,\r\ngalloped through the flint stones, the water and the lightning-flashes.\r\nShe had flung away her umbrella the better to hear the thunder; the\r\nguide cried to her:\r\n\r\n\"Recommend your soul to God! In the name of the Father, and of the Son,\r\nand of the Holy Ghost!\"\r\n\r\nWe reached Voreppe to the sound of the tocsin; what remained of the\r\ncloven storm lay before us. In the distant landscape, we saw a blazing\r\nvillage and the moon rounding out the upper portion of his disc above\r\nthe clouds, like the pale, bald forehead of St. Bruno, the founder of\r\nthe order of silence. M. Ballanche, all dripping with rain, said with\r\nhis immovable placidity:\r\n\r\n\"I am like a fish in the water.\"\r\n\r\nI have just seen Voreppe again, in this year 1838: the storm was\r\nthere no longer; but two witnesses of it still remain, Madame de\r\nChateaubriand and M. Ballanche. I mention this because I have too\r\noften, in these Memoirs, had to call attention to the dead.\r\n\r\nOn returning to Lyons we left our companion there, and went to\r\nVilleneuve. I have told you about this little town, my walks and my\r\nregrets on the banks of the Yonne with M. Joubert. Three old maids\r\nused to live there, Mesdemoiselles Piat; they reminded me of my\r\ngrandmother's three friends at Plancoët, saving the difference in\r\nsocial position. The virgins of Villeneuve died one after the other,\r\nand I thought of them when I saw a grass-grown flight of steps, running\r\nup outside their empty house. What used these village damsels to talk\r\nabout in their time! They spoke of a dog, and of a muff which their\r\nfather had once bought them at Sens Fair. To me this was as charming\r\nas the council of the same town at which St. Bernard had Abélard, my\r\nfellow-Breton, condemned. The maids of the muff were Heloïses perhaps;\r\nperhaps they loved, and their letters, brought to light, will one day\r\nentrance posterity. Who knows? Perhaps they wrote to their \"lord, also\r\ntheir father, also their brother, also their spouse: _domino suo, imo\r\npatri_,\" etc., that they felt honoured by the name of friend, by the\r\nname of \"mistress\" or of \"courtesan: _concubinæ vel scorti._\"\r\n\r\n\"In the midst of his learning,\" says a grave doctor, \"I find that\r\nAbélard played an admirably foolish prank when he suborned with love\r\nhis pupil Héloïse.\"\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Illness of Lucile.]\r\n\r\nA great and new sorrow surprised me at Villeneuve. To tell it you,\r\nI must go back to a few months before my Swiss journey. I was still\r\noccupying the house in the Rue Miromesnil when, in the autumn of\r\n1804, Madame de Caud came to Paris. The death of Madame de Beaumont\r\nhad finished the affecting of my sister's reason; she was very near\r\nrefusing to believe in the death, suspecting some mystery in the\r\ndisappearance, or including Heaven in the number of the enemies who\r\nmocked at her misfortunes. She had nothing; I had chosen an apartment\r\nin the Rue Caumartin for her, deceiving her as to the rent and as\r\nto the arrangements which I told her to make with the keeper of an\r\neating-house. Like a flame ready to expire, her genius shed the\r\nbrightest light; she was all illumined with it. She would write a few\r\nlines which she threw into the fire, or else copy from books some\r\nthoughts in harmony with the disposition of her soul. She did not\r\nremain long in the Rue Caumartin; she went to live with the Dames\r\nSaint-Michel, in the Rue du Faubourg Saint-Jacques: Madame de Navarre\r\nwas the superior of the convent. Lucile had a little cell overlooking\r\nthe garden: I noticed that she followed with her eyes, with I know\r\nnot what gloomy longing, the nuns who walked in the enclosure around\r\nthe vegetable beds. One could guess that she envied the saints and,\r\ngoing further, aspired to the angels. I will sanctify these Memoirs by\r\ndeposing in them, as relics, the following letters of Madame de Caud,\r\nwritten before she had taken flight for her eternal country:\r\n\r\n    \"17 _January._\r\n\r\n    \"I had placed all my happiness in you and in Madame de\r\n    Beaumont; I fled from my cares and my sorrows in the thought\r\n    of you two: my whole occupation was to love you. Last night\r\n    I made long reflections upon your character and your ways.\r\n    As you and I are always near each other, it needs some time,\r\n    I think, to know me, such is the variety of ideas in my\r\n    head! Such is the opposition of my timidity and my peculiar\r\n    external weakness to my real inner strength! Too much about\r\n    myself. My illustrious brother, accept my fondest thanks for\r\n    all the favours and all the marks of friendship which you\r\n    have never ceased to show me. This is the last letter you\r\n    will receive from me in the morning. Albeit I communicate\r\n    my ideas to you, they nevertheless remain quite completely\r\n    within myself.\"\r\n\r\n    (_No date._)\r\n\r\n    \"Do you seriously, dear, think me safe from some impertinence\r\n    on the part of M. Chênedollé? I am quite determined not to\r\n    invite him to continue his visits; I resign myself to look\r\n    upon Tuesday's as the last. I do not wish to trouble his\r\n    politeness. I am closing for ever the book of my fate, and\r\n    sealing it with the seal of reason; I shall now consult its\r\n    pages no more on the trifles than on the important things of\r\n    life. I give up all my foolish notions; I wish neither to\r\n    occupy nor to vex myself with those of other people; I will\r\n    abandon myself with heart and soul to all the events of my\r\n    passage through this world. What a pity that I should pay\r\n    myself so much attention! God can now afflict me only in you.\r\n    I thank Him for the precious, kind and dear present which He\r\n    has made me in your person and for having preserved my life\r\n    without stain: those are all my treasures. I could take for\r\n    an emblem of my life the moon in a cloud, with this device:\r\n    'Often obscured, never tarnished.' Farewell, dear. You will\r\n    perhaps be surprised at my words since yesterday morning.\r\n    Since I saw you, my heart has raised itself to God, and I\r\n    have laid it wholly at the foot of the Cross, its sole and\r\n    true place.\"\r\n\r\n    \"_Thursday._\r\n\r\n    \"Good-morning, dear. What colour are your ideas this morning?\r\n    As for me, I remember that the only person who was able to\r\n    relieve me when I was fearing for Madame de Farcy's life was\r\n    she who said to me, 'But it is within the range of possible\r\n    things that you may die before her.' Could any one have\r\n    spoken more to the point? There is nothing, dear, like the\r\n    idea of death to rid us of the future. I hasten to rid you of\r\n    myself this morning, for I feel myself too much in the mood\r\n    to say fine things. Good-bye, my poor brother. Keep joyful.\"\r\n\r\n    (_No date._)\r\n\r\n    \"While Madame de Farcy lived, always by her side, I had not\r\n    noticed the need of being in communion of thought with some\r\n    one.

But since we\r\n    lost that friend, and circumstances having separated me from\r\n    you, I have known the torture of never being able to refresh\r\n    and renew one's mind in some one's conversation; I feel that\r\n    my ideas hurt me when I am unable to get rid of them; this\r\n    has surely to do with my bad organization. Nevertheless I am\r\n    fairly satisfied, since yesterday, with my courage. I pay no\r\n    attention to my grief and to the sort of inward faintness\r\n    which I feel. I have abandoned myself.

My life is casting its last light, like a\r\n    lamp which has burnt out in the darkness of a long night,\r\n    and which sees the rise of the dawn in which it is to die.\r\n    Please, brother, cast a single glance at the early moments\r\n    of our existence; remember that we have often been seated\r\n    on the same lap, and pressed both together to the same\r\n    bosom; that already you added tears to mine, that from\r\n    the earliest days of your life you protected and defended\r\n    my frail existence, that our games united us and that I\r\n    shared your first studies. I will not speak to you of our\r\n    adolescence, of the innocence of our thoughts and of our\r\n    joys, nor of our mutual need to see each other incessantly.\r\n    If I retrace the past, I candidly confess, brother, that\r\n    it is to make me revive the more in your heart. When you\r\n    left France for the second time, you placed your wife in my\r\n    hands, you made me promise never to part from her. True to\r\n    this dear engagement, I voluntarily stretched out my hands\r\n    to the irons, and entered into the regions destined alone\r\n    for the victims vowed to death. In those abodes I have had\r\n    no anxiety save as to your fate; incessantly I questioned\r\n    the forebodings of my heart touching yourself. When I had\r\n    recovered my liberty, amidst the ills which came to overwhelm\r\n    me, the thought alone of our meeting kept me up. To-day, when\r\n    I am irretrievably losing the hope of running my course by\r\n    your side, bear with my griefs. I shall become resigned to my\r\n    destiny, and it is only because I am still fighting against\r\n    it that I suffer such cruel anguish; but when I shall have\r\n    grown submissive to my fate.... And what a fate! Where are\r\n    my friends, my protectors and my treasures! To whom matters\r\n    my existence, that existence abandoned by all, and weighing\r\n    down entirely upon itself? My God, are not my present woes\r\n    enough for my weakness, without yet adding to them the dread\r\n    of the future? Forgive me, my too dear friend, I will resign\r\n    myself; I will fall asleep, in a slumber as of death, upon\r\n    my destiny. But, during the few days which I have to spend in\r\n    this town, let me seek my last consolations in you; let me\r\n    believe that my presence is sweet to you. Believe me, among\r\n    the hearts that love you, none approaches the sincerity and\r\n    tenderness of my impotent friendship for you. Fill my memory\r\n    with agreeable recollections, which prolong my existence\r\n    beside you. Yesterday, when you spoke to me of coming to\r\n    you, you seemed to me anxious and serious, while your words\r\n    were affectionate. Why, brother, could I be to you also a\r\n    subject of aversion and annoyance? You know it was not I\r\n    that proposed the amiable distraction of going to see you,\r\n    and that I promised you to make no ill use of it; but, if\r\n    you have changed your opinion, why did you not tell me so\r\n    frankly? I have no courage to set against your politeness.\r\n    Formerly you used to distinguish me a little more from the\r\n    common herd and to do me more justice. As you reckon upon me\r\n    to-day, I will come to see you presently, at eleven o'clock.\r\n    We will arrange together what seems best to you for the\r\n    future. I have written to you, feeling sure that I should not\r\n    have the courage to say to you a single word of what this\r\n    letter contains.\"\r\n\r\nThis so affecting and quite admirable letter is the last which I\r\nreceived; it alarmed me through the increase of sadness of which it\r\nbears the impress. I hurried to the Dames Saint-Michel; my sister was\r\nwalking in the garden with Madame de Navarre; she went in when she knew\r\nthat I had gone up to her room. She made visible efforts to collect her\r\nideas, and at intervals she had a slight convulsive movement of the\r\nlips. I entreated her to return entirely to reason, to cease writing\r\nsuch unjust things to me, things that rent my heart, to cease thinking\r\nthat I could ever grow weary of her. She appeared to grow a little\r\ncalmer at the words which I repeated to distract and console her. She\r\ntold me that she believed that the convent was doing her harm, that she\r\nwould feel better living alone, in the neighbourhood of the Jardin des\r\nPlantes, there where she could see doctors and walk about. I urged her\r\nto please her own taste, adding that in order to help Virginie, her\r\nmaid, I would give her old Saint-Germain. This proposal seemed to give\r\nher great pleasure, in memory of Madame de Beaumont, and she assured me\r\nthat she would go to look out for her new lodging. She asked me how I\r\nwas thinking of spending the summer. I said that I should go to Vichy\r\nto join my wife, and then to M. Joubert at Villeneuve, to return to\r\nParis from there. I suggested to her to accompany us. She answered that\r\nshe wished to spend the summer alone, and that she was going to send\r\nVirginie back to Fougères. I left her; she was more at ease.\r\n\r\nMadame de Chateaubriand left for Vichy, and I prepared to follow her.\r\nBefore leaving Paris I went again to see Lucile. She was affectionate;\r\nshe spoke to me of her little writings. I encouraged the great poet to\r\nwork; she kissed me, wished me a good journey, made me promise to come\r\nback soon. She saw me to the landing of the staircase, leant over the\r\nbaluster, and quietly watched me go down. When I reached the bottom I\r\nstopped, and lifting my head, cried to the unhappy woman who was still\r\nlooking at me:\r\n\r\n\"Farewell, dear sister! I shall see you soon! Take great care of\r\nyourself! Write to me at Villeneuve. I will write to you. I hope that\r\nnext winter you will agree to live with us.\"\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Death of Lucile.]\r\n\r\nThat evening I saw the worthy Saint-Germain; I gave him orders and some\r\nmoney, so that he might secretly reduce the prices of anything she\r\nmight require. I enjoined him to keep me informed of everything and not\r\nto fail to call me back in case he should want to see me. Three months\r\npassed. When I reached Villeneuve, I found two fairly tranquillizing\r\nletters about Madame de Caud's health: but Saint-Germain forgot to\r\nspeak to me of my sister's new lodging. I had begun to write her a long\r\nletter, when suddenly Madame de Chateaubriand fell dangerously ill: I\r\nwas at her bedside when I was brought a new letter from Saint-Germain;\r\nI opened it: a withering line told me of the sudden death of Lucile.\r\n\r\nI have cared for many tombs in my life: it fell to my lot and to my\r\nsister's destiny that her ashes should be flung to the skies. I was not\r\nin Paris when she died; I had no relations there; kept at Villeneuve by\r\nmy wife's critical condition, I was unable to go to the sacred remains;\r\norders sent from a distance arrived too late to prevent a common\r\nburial. Lucile knew no one and had not a friend; she was known only to\r\nMadame de Beaumont's old servant: it was as though he had been charged\r\nto link two destinies. He alone followed the forsaken coffin, and he\r\nhimself was dead before Madame de Chateaubriand's sufferings allowed me\r\nto bring her back to Paris.\r\n\r\nMy sister was buried among the poor: in what grave-yard was she laid?\r\nIn what motionless wave of an ocean of dead was she swallowed up? In\r\nwhat house did she die, after leaving the community of the Dames de\r\nSaint-Michel? If, by making researches, if, by examining the archives\r\nof the municipalities, the registers of the parishes, I should come\r\nacross my sister's name, what would that avail me[688]? Should I\r\nfind the same keeper of the cemetery? Should I find the man who dug\r\na grave that remained nameless and unlabelled? Would the rough hands\r\nthat were the last to touch so pure a clay have remembered it? What\r\nnomenclator of the shades could point out to me the obliterated tomb?\r\nMight he not make a mistake as to the dust? Since Heaven has willed it\r\nso, let Lucile be for ever lost! I find in this absence of locality a\r\ndistinction from the burials of my other friends. My predecessor in\r\nthis world and in the next is praying to the Redeemer for me; she is\r\npraying to Him from the midst of the pauper remains among which her\r\nown lie confounded: even so does Lucile's mother and mine rest lost\r\namong the preferred of Jesus Christ. God will certainly have been able\r\nto recognise my sister; and she, who was so little attached to earth,\r\nought to leave no trace there. She has left me, that sainted genius.\r\nNot a day has passed but I have wept for her. Lucile loved to hide\r\nherself; I have made her a solitude in my heart: she shall leave it\r\nonly when I shall have ceased to live[689].\r\n\r\nThose are the true, the only events of my real life! What mattered\r\nto me, at the moment when I was losing my sister, the thousands of\r\nsoldiers falling on the battlefields, the destruction of thrones, the\r\nchanges in the face of the world?\r\n\r\nLucile's death struck at the sources of my soul: it was my childhood\r\nin the midst of my family, the first vestiges of my existence, that\r\nwere disappearing. Our life resembles those frail buildings, shored\r\nup in the sky by flying buttresses: they do not crumble at once, but\r\nbecome loose piecemeal; they still support some gallery or other, while\r\nalready they have become separated from the chancel or vault of the\r\nedifice. Madame de Chateaubriand, still bruised by Lucile's imperious\r\nwhims, saw only a deliverance for the Christian who had gone to rest in\r\nthe Lord. Let us be gentle if we would be regretted; the loftiness of\r\ngenius and the higher qualities are mourned only by the angels. But I\r\ncannot enter into the consolation of Madame de Chateaubriand.\r\n\r\n*\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: My journey to the East.]\r\n\r\nWhen, returning to Paris by the Burgundy road, I caught sight of the\r\ncupola of the Val-de-Grâce and the dome of Sainte-Geneviève, which\r\noverlooks the Jardin des Plantes, my heart was broken: one more\r\ncompanion of my life left on the wayside! We went back to the Hôtel de\r\nCoislin, and although M. de Fontanes, M. Joubert, M. de Clausel, M.\r\nMolé came to spend the evenings with me, I was distraught by so many\r\nmemories and thoughts that I was utterly exhausted. Remaining alone\r\nbehind the objects that had quitted me, like a foreign mariner whose\r\nengagement has expired, and who has neither home nor country, I struck\r\nthe shore with my foot; I longed to swim in a new ocean to refresh\r\nmyself and cross it. Nursed on Mount Pindus, a crusader to Hierosolyma,\r\nI was impatient to go to mingle my loneliness with the ruins of Athens,\r\nmy tears with those of the Magdalen.\r\n\r\nI went to see my family[690] in Brittany, returned to Paris, and\r\nleft for Trieste on the 13th of July 1806; Madame de Chateaubriand\r\naccompanied me as far as Venice, where M. Ballanche came to join her.\r\n\r\nAs my life is set forth hour by hour in the _Itinéraire_, I should\r\nhave no more to say here, if I had not kept some hitherto unknown\r\nletters written or received during and after my voyage. Julien, my\r\nservant and companion, wrote his own Itinerary side by side with mine,\r\njust as passengers on a vessel keep their private logs on a journey\r\nof discovery. The little manuscript which he places at my disposal\r\nwill serve as a check upon my narrative: I shall be Cook, he will be\r\nClarke[691].\r\n\r\nIn order to bring into clearer light the different manner in which one\r\nis impressed according to one's place in the social order and in the\r\nintellectual hierarchy, I will mingle my narrative with Julien's[692].\r\nI shall let him begin by speaking first, because he relates some days'\r\nsailing without me from Modon to Smyrna.\r\n\r\n    JULIEN'S ITINERARY.\r\n\r\n    \"We went on board[693] on Friday the 1st of August; but,\r\n    the wind not being favourable to leave harbour, we waited\r\n    until daybreak the next morning. Then the harbour-pilot\r\n    came to tell us that he could bring us out. As I had never\r\n    been on the sea, I had formed an exaggerated idea of the\r\n    danger, for I saw none during two days. But, on the third, a\r\n    tempest rose; lightning, thunder and, in short, a terrible\r\n    storm attacked us and beat up the sea frightfully. Our\r\n    crew consisted of only eight sailors, a captain, a mate, a\r\n    pilot and a cook, and five passengers, including Monsieur\r\n    and myself, which made seventeen men in all. Then we all\r\n    set ourselves to help the seamen in furling the sails, in\r\n    spite of the rain with which we were soon drenched, having\r\n    taken off our coats to move more freely. This work filled my\r\n    thoughts and made me forget the danger, which, indeed, is\r\n    more terrible through the idea which one forms of it than it\r\n    is in reality. The storms followed one another during two\r\n    days, which seasoned me in my first days of sea-faring; I was\r\n    in no way inconvenienced. Monsieur was afraid lest I should\r\n    be ill at sea; when calm set in again, he said to me:\r\n\r\n    \"'Now I am reassured about your health; as you have borne\r\n    these two stormy days so well, you can set your mind at rest\r\n    as to any other mischance.'\r\n\r\n    \"None occurred during the remainder of our crossing to\r\n    Smyrna. On the 10th, which was a Sunday, Monsieur made them\r\n    heave-to near a Turkish town called Modon, where he landed to\r\n    go to Greece. Among the passengers who were with us were two\r\n    Milanese, who were going to Smyrna to follow their trade of\r\n    tinmen and pewter-founders. One of the two, called Joseph,\r\n    spoke the Turkish language fairly well, and Monsieur proposed\r\n    that he should go with him as servant interpreter, and\r\n    mentions him in his _Itinéraire._ He told us, on leaving us,\r\n    that the journey would only take a few days, that he would\r\n    join the vessel at an island where we were to pass in four\r\n    or five days, and that he would wait for us in that island\r\n    if he arrived there before us. As Monsieur found that man to\r\n    suit him for that short journey[694], he left me on board\r\n    to continue my voyage to Smyrna and to look after all our\r\n    luggage. He had given me a letter of recommendation to the\r\n    French Consul, in case he did not join us, which was what\r\n    happened. On the fourth day, we arrived at the appointed\r\n    island and Monsieur was not there. We passed the night and\r\n    waited for him till seven o'clock in the morning. The captain\r\n    went back on shore to leave word that he was compelled to\r\n    go on, having a fair wind and being obliged to take his\r\n    crossing into consideration. Besides, he saw a pirate who was\r\n    trying to approach us, and it was urgent that we should place\r\n    ourselves promptly on the defensive. He made the men load his\r\n    four pieces of cannon and bring on deck his muskets, pistols\r\n    and side-arms; but, as the wind favoured us, the pirate gave\r\n    us up. We arrived, on Monday the 18th, at seven o'clock in\r\n    the evening, at the port of Smyrna.\"\r\n\r\n    *\r\n\r\n    [Sidenote: Greece.]\r\n\r\n    After crossing Greece, and touching Zea and Chio, I found\r\n    Julien at Smyrna. To-day I see Greece in my memory as one\r\n    of those dazzling circles which one sometimes beholds on\r\n    closing one's eyes. Against that mysterious phosphorescence\r\n    are outlined ruins of a delicate and admirable architecture,\r\n    the whole rendered still more resplendent by I know not\r\n    what brightness of the Muses. When shall I see again the\r\n    thyme of Mount Hymettus, the oleanders of the banks of the\r\n    Eurotas? One of the men whom I have left with the greatest\r\n    envy on foreign shores is the Turkish custom-house officer\r\n    of the Piræus: he lived alone, the guardian of three\r\n    deserted ports, turning his gaze over bluey isles, gleaming\r\n    promontories, golden seas. There I heard nought save the\r\n    sound of the billows in the shattered tomb of Themistocles\r\n    and the murmur of distant memories; in the silence of the\r\n    ruins of Sparta, fame itself was dumb.\r\n\r\n    In the cradle of Melesigene I left my poor dragoman,\r\n    Joseph, the Milanese, at his tinman's shop, and set out for\r\n    Constantinople. I went to Pergamos, wishing first to go to\r\n    Troy, from motives of poetic piety; a fall from my horse\r\n    awaited me at the commencement of my road; not that Pegasus\r\n    stumbled, but I slept. I have recalled this accident in my\r\n    _Itinéraire_; Julien relates it also, and he makes remarks\r\n    concerning the roads and the horses to the exactness of which\r\n    I can certify.\r\n\r\n    JULIEN'S ITINERARY.\r\n\r\n    \"Monsieur, who had fallen asleep on his horse, tumbled off\r\n    without waking. His horse stopped forthwith, as did mine,\r\n    which followed it. I at once alighted to know the reason, for\r\n    it was impossible for me to see it at a fathom's distance.\r\n    I saw Monsieur half asleep beside his horse, and quite\r\n    astonished to find himself on the ground; he assured me that\r\n    he had not hurt himself. His horse did not try to run away,\r\n    which would have been dangerous, for there were precipices\r\n    very near to the spot where we were.\"\r\n\r\n    On leaving the Soma, after passing Pergamos, I had the\r\n    dispute with my guide which I describe in the _Itinéraire._\r\n    Here is Julien's version:\r\n\r\n    JULIEN'S ITINERARY.\r\n\r\n    \"We left that village very early, after renewing our canteen.\r\n    A little way from the village, I was greatly surprised to\r\n    see Monsieur angry with our guide; I asked him the reason.\r\n    Monsieur then told me that he had arranged with the guide,\r\n    at Smyrna, that he would take him to the plains of Troy on\r\n    the way, and that he was now refusing, saying that the plains\r\n    were infested with brigands. Monsieur declined to believe\r\n    a word of it, and would listen to no one. As I saw that he\r\n    was getting more and more out of temper, I made a sign to\r\n    the guide to come near the interpreter and the janissary to\r\n    explain to me what he had been told about the dangers to be\r\n    risked in the plains which Monsieur wished to visit. The\r\n    guide told the interpreter that he had been assured that one\r\n    had to be in great numbers not to be attacked; the janissary\r\n    told me the same thing. Thereupon I went to Monsieur and\r\n    told him what they had all three said, and that, besides, we\r\n    should find a little village at a day's march where there\r\n    was a sort of consul who would be able to inform us of the\r\n    truth. After this statement, Monsieur composed himself, and\r\n    we continued our road till we reached that place. He at\r\n    once went to the consul, who told him of all the dangers he\r\n    would risk if he persisted in his wish to go in such small\r\n    numbers to those plains of Troy. Thereupon Monsieur was\r\n    obliged to abandon his project, and we continued our road for\r\n    Constantinople.\"\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Constantinople.]\r\n\r\nI arrived at Constantinople.\r\n\r\n    MY ITINERARY.\r\n\r\n    \"The almost total absence of women, the dearth of wheeled\r\n    carriages, and the packs of ownerless dogs were the three\r\n    distinctive characteristics that first struck me in this\r\n    extraordinary town. As nearly every one walks in papouches,\r\n    as there is no noise of carriages and carts, as there are\r\n    no bells and scarcely any hammering trades, the silence\r\n    is continual. You see around you a voiceless crowd which\r\n    seems to wish to pass unnoticed, and which always looks as\r\n    though it were stealing away from its master's sight. You\r\n    constantly come to a bazaar or a cemetery, as though the\r\n    Turks were only there to buy, sell, or die. The cemeteries,\r\n    unwalled and placed in the middle of the streets, are\r\n    magnificent cypress-woods: the doves build their nests in the\r\n    cypress-trees and share the peace of the dead. Here and there\r\n    one discovers some ancient monuments which have no connection\r\n    with the modern men, nor with the new monuments by which they\r\n    are surrounded; it is as though they had been transported to\r\n    this eastern town by the working of a talisman. No sign of\r\n    joy, no appearance of happiness shows itself to your eyes;\r\n    what you see is not a people but a herd whom an iman drives\r\n    and a janissary slays. Amidst the prisons and the gaols rises\r\n    a seraglio, the capitol of servitude: it is there that a\r\n    sacred guardian carefully preserves the germs of pestilence\r\n    and the primitive laws of tyranny.\"\r\n\r\nJulien does not soar so near the clouds[695].\r\n\r\n    MY ITINERARY.\r\n\r\n    \"We were about two hundred passengers on the ship, men,\r\n    women, children and old people. As many mats lay ranged in\r\n    rows on both sides of the steerage. In this kind of republic,\r\n    each kept house as he pleased: the women looked after their\r\n    children, the men smoked or prepared their dinners, the\r\n    popes talked together. On every side was heard the sound\r\n    of mandolines, fiddles and lyres. They sang, they danced,\r\n    they laughed, they prayed. Every one was joyful. They said\r\n    to me, 'Jerusalem!' pointing to the south; and I replied,\r\n    'Jerusalem!' In short, but for the fright, we should have\r\n    been the happiest people in the world; but at the least wind\r\n    the seamen furled the sails, the pilgrims cried, '_Christos,\r\n    Kyrie eleison!_' When the storm had passed, we resumed our\r\n    boldness.\"\r\n\r\nHere I am beaten by Julien.\r\n\r\n    JULIEN'S ITINERARY.\r\n\r\n    \"We had to busy ourselves with our departure for Jaffa, which\r\n    took place on Thursday the 18th of September. We embarked on\r\n    board a Greek ship, where there were at least, men, women,\r\n    and children, one hundred and fifty Greeks who were going on\r\n    a pilgrimage to Jerusalem, which caused much disturbance on\r\n    board.\r\n\r\n    \"Like the other passengers, we too had our supply of\r\n    provisions and our cooking utensils, which I had bought in\r\n    Constantinople. I had, besides, a further and fairly complete\r\n    supply which M. l'Ambassadeur had given us, consisting of\r\n    very fine biscuits, hams, sausages, saveloys, different sorts\r\n    of wine, rum, sugar, lemons, and even quinine-wine against\r\n    the fever. I was therefore furnished with a very plentiful\r\n    provision, which I husbanded and only consumed with great\r\n    economy, knowing that we had more than this one crossing to\r\n    make: everything was locked up where the passengers were not\r\n    allowed to go.\r\n\r\n    \"Our crossing, which lasted only thirteen days, seemed\r\n    very long to me through all sorts of unpleasantness and\r\n    uncleanliness on board. During several days of bad weather\r\n    which we encountered, the women and children were sick,\r\n    throwing up everywhere, so much so that we were obliged to\r\n    leave our cabin and sleep on deck. There we took our meals\r\n    much more comfortably than elsewhere, as we decided to wait\r\n    until all our Greeks had finished their littering.\"\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Mount Carmel.]\r\n\r\nI passed through the Dardanelles, touched at Rhodes, and took a pilot\r\nfor the Syrian coast. We were stopped by a calm below the Asiatic\r\ncontinent, almost opposite the old Cape Chelidonia. We remained two\r\ndays at sea without knowing where we were.\r\n\r\n    MY ITINERARY.\r\n\r\n    \"The weather was so fine and the air so mild that all the\r\n    passengers spent the night on deck. I had contended for a\r\n    place on the quarter-deck with two fat caloyers, who yielded\r\n    it to me only after much grumbling. I was lying asleep there\r\n    at six o'clock in the morning on the 30th of September,\r\n    when I was aroused by a confused noise of voices: I opened\r\n    my eyes, and saw the pilgrims looking towards the prow of\r\n    the vessel. I asked what it was; they shouted '_Signor,\r\n    il Carmelo!_' Mount Carmel! The wind had risen at eight\r\n    o'clock the previous evening, and we had arrived in sight of\r\n    the Syrian coast during the night. As I was sleeping fully\r\n    dressed, I was soon on my feet, asking the whereabouts of the\r\n    sacred mountain. Everyone was eager to point it out to me;\r\n    but I perceived nothing, owing to the sun which was beginning\r\n    to rise opposite to us. That moment had about it something\r\n    religious and august: all the pilgrims, their beads in their\r\n    hands, had remained silently in the same attitude, awaiting\r\n    the apparition of the Holy Land; the chief of the popes\r\n    prayed aloud: one heard only that prayer and the sound of the\r\n    running of the vessel, which the most favourable wind was\r\n    impelling across a dazzling sea. From time to time a shout\r\n    rose from the prow, when one caught sight of Mount Carmel\r\n    again. At last I myself perceived the mountain, like a round\r\n    patch beneath the rays of the sun. I then went on my knees in\r\n    the manner of the Latins. I did not feel the peculiar trouble\r\n    which I experienced on discovering the coast of Greece: but\r\n    the sight of the cradle of the Israelites and the native land\r\n    of the Christians filled me with joy and respect. I was about\r\n    to step upon the land of prodigies, near the sources of the\r\n    most astounding poetry, in the region where, even humanly\r\n    speaking, the greatest event took place that ever changed the\r\n    face of the world. . . . . . . . . . .\r\n\r\n    \"The wind dropped at noon; it rose again at four o'clock; but\r\n    through the ignorance of the pilot we went beyond our aim....\r\n    At two o'clock in the afternoon we saw Jaffa again.\r\n\r\n    \"A boat left the shore with three monks. I stepped into the\r\n    launch with them; we entered the harbour through an opening\r\n    effected between the rocks, and dangerous even for a ship's\r\n    boat.\r\n\r\n    \"The Arabs on the beach came out into the water to their\r\n    waists, in order to take us on their shoulders. Then there\r\n    followed a rather laughable scene: my servant was dressed in\r\n    a whitish frock-coat; white being the colour of distinction\r\n    among the Arabs, they deemed that Julien was the sheik. They\r\n    caught hold of him and carried him off in triumph, despite\r\n    his protests, while, thanks to my blue coat, I made my escape\r\n    humbly on the back of a ragged beggar.\"\r\n\r\nNow let us hear Julien, the principal actor in the scene:\r\n\r\n    JULIEN'S ITINERARY.\r\n\r\n    \"What surprised me greatly was to see six Arabs come to carry\r\n    me on land, while there were only two for Monsieur, which\r\n    amused him much, to see me carried like a reliquary. I do not\r\n    know whether my apparel seemed to them more brilliant than\r\n    Monsieur's: he wore a brown frock-coat and buttons of the\r\n    same; mine was whitish, with buttons of white metal which\r\n    gave off a certain gleam in the bright sunshine: this may, no\r\n    doubt, have caused the mistake.\r\n\r\n    \"We went, on Wednesday the 1st of October, to the monks of\r\n    Jaffa, who belong to the Order of Cordeliers, speaking Latin\r\n    and Italian, but very little French. They received us very\r\n    well, and did all that in them lay to procure for us all we\r\n    needed.\"\r\n\r\nI arrived in Jerusalem. On the advice of the Fathers of the convent,\r\nI passed quickly through the Holy City to go to the Jordan. After\r\nstopping at the monastery at Bethlehem, I set out with an Arab escort;\r\nI stopped at St. Sabas. At midnight, I found myself on the shore of the\r\nDead Sea.\r\n\r\n    MY ITINERARY.\r\n\r\n    \"When one travels in Judæa, at first the heart is seized\r\n    with a great sense of tediousness; but when, as you pass from\r\n    solitude to solitude, space stretches limitless before your\r\n    eyes, that feeling gradually wears away, and you experience\r\n    a secret terror which, far from casting down the soul, gives\r\n    courage and raises the spirit. Extraordinary views discover\r\n    on every side a land laboured by miracles: the burning sun,\r\n    the swooping eagle, the barren fig-tree, all the poetry, all\r\n    the scenes of the Scriptures are there. Every name contains\r\n    a mystery; every grotto declares the future; every summit\r\n    resounds with a prophet's accents. God Himself has spoken on\r\n    those shores: the dried-up torrents, the cleft rocks, the\r\n    half-open tombs testify to the working of wonders; the desert\r\n    appears to be still mute with terror, and it is as though\r\n    it had not ventured to break the silence since it heard the\r\n    voice of the Almighty.\r\n\r\n    \"We descended from the brow of the mountain, in order to go\r\n    to spend the night on the shore of the Dead Sea, and next to\r\n    go up to the Jordan[696].\r\n\r\n    . . . . . . . . . .\r\n\r\n    \"We broke up our camp, and made our way for an hour and a\r\n    half with excessive difficulty through a fine white dust.\r\n    We were proceeding towards a small wood of balsam-trees and\r\n    tamarinds, which I saw to my great astonishment rising from\r\n    the midst of a sterile soil. Suddenly the Bethlemites stopped\r\n    and pointed to something which I had not perceived, at the\r\n    bottom of a ravine. Without being able to say what it was, I\r\n    caught a glimpse as though of a kind of sand moving over the\r\n    immobility of the soil. I approached this singular object,\r\n    and I saw a yellow river which I had some difficulty in\r\n    distinguishing from the sand of its two banks. It was deeply\r\n    embanked, and flowed slowly in a thick stream: it was the\r\n    Jordan....\r\n\r\n    \"The Bethlemites stripped and plunged into the Jordan. I did\r\n    not dare to follow their lead, because of the fever which\r\n    still troubled me.\"\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Jerusalem.]\r\n\r\nWe returned to Jerusalem; Julien was not much struck with the sacred\r\nplaces: like a true philosopher, he was dry[697].\r\n\r\nI left Jerusalem, arrived at Jaffa, and took ship for Alexandria. From\r\nAlexandria I went to Cairo, and I left Julien with M. Drovetti, who had\r\nthe kindness to charter an Austrian vessel for me for Tunis. Julien\r\ncontinued his journal at Alexandria:\r\n\r\n\"There are Jews here,\" he says, \"who gamble in stocks, as they do\r\nwherever they are. Half a league from the city stands Pompey's Column,\r\nwhich is in reddish granite, mounted on a block of hewn stone.\"\r\n\r\n    MY ITINERARY.\r\n\r\n    \"On the 23rd of November, at midday, the wind having\r\n    become favourable, I went on board the vessel. I embraced\r\n    M. Drovetti on the shore, and we made mutual promises of\r\n    friendship and remembrance: I am paying my debt to-day.\r\n\r\n    \"We heaved the anchor at two o'clock. A pilot brought us\r\n    out of harbour. The wind was faint and southerly. We kept\r\n    for three days within sight of Pompey's Column, which we\r\n    discovered on the horizon. On the evening of the third day we\r\n    heard the evening gun of the port of Alexandria. This was as\r\n    it were the signal for our definite departure, for the north\r\n    wind rose and we made sail for the west.\r\n\r\n    \"On the 1st of December, the wind, veering due west, stopped\r\n    our way. Gradually it fell to the south-west and turned into\r\n    a tempest which did not cease until we reached Tunis. To\r\n    occupy my time, I copied out and set in order my notes on\r\n    this voyage and my descriptions for the _Martyrs._ At night,\r\n    I walked the deck with the mate, Captain Dinelli. Nights\r\n    spent amid the waves, on a vessel beaten by the storm, are\r\n    not barren; the uncertainty of our future gives objects\r\n    their true value: the land, contemplated from the midst of a\r\n    tempestuous sea, resembles life as it presents itself to a\r\n    man about to die[698].\"\r\n\r\nWe continued our voyage and anchored before the Kerkenna Isles.\r\n\r\n    MY ITINERARY.\r\n\r\n    \"A gale rose, to our great delight, from the south-east, and\r\n    in five days we arrived in the waters of the island of Malta.\r\n    We came into sight of it on Christmas Eve; but, on Christmas\r\n    Day, the wind, shifting to west-north-west, drove us to the\r\n    south of Lampedusa. We remained for eighteen days off the\r\n    east coast of the Kingdom of Tunis, between life and death.\r\n    I shall never in my life forget the day of the 28th.\r\n\r\n    \"We cast anchor before the Kerkenna Isles. For eight days\r\n    we lay at anchor in the Gulf of Cabes, where I saw the\r\n    commencement of the year 1807. Under how many planets and\r\n    amid what varied fortunes had I already seen the years renew\r\n    for me, years which pass so quickly or which are so long!\r\n    How far away from me were those times of my childhood in\r\n    which, with a heart beating with joy, I received the paternal\r\n    blessing and the paternal gifts! How I used to look forward\r\n    to New Year's Day! And now, on a foreign vessel, in the\r\n    middle of the sea, within sight of a barbarous land, that New\r\n    Year's Day sped for me without witnesses, without pleasures,\r\n    without the kisses of my family, without the fond wishes of\r\n    happiness which a mother shapes with such sincerity for her\r\n    sons! That day, born in the womb of the tempests, let fall on\r\n    my head nought but cares, regrets and silver hairs.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The Kerkenna Isles.]\r\n\r\nJulien is exposed to the same fate, and he rebukes me for one of those\r\nfits of impatience of which I have, fortunately, corrected myself.\r\n\r\n    JULIEN'S ITINERARY.\r\n\r\n    \"We were very near the island of Malta, and we had reason\r\n    to fear that we might be seen by some English vessel, which\r\n    could have forced us to enter the harbour; but we encountered\r\n    none. Our crew was greatly exhausted, and the wind continued\r\n    to be unfavourable to us. The captain, seeing on his chart\r\n    an anchorage called Kerkenna, from which we were at no great\r\n    distance, made sail for it without telling Monsieur, who,\r\n    seeing that we were approaching that anchorage, became angry\r\n    at not having been consulted, and said to the captain that\r\n    he ought to continue his course, having been through worse\r\n    weather. But we had gone too far to resume our course, and\r\n    besides, the captain's prudence was highly approved, for\r\n    that night the wind grew much stronger and the sea very bad.\r\n    Finding that we were obliged to remain in the anchoring-place\r\n    four-and-twenty hours longer than was foreseen, Monsieur gave\r\n    the captain lively marks of his discontent, in spite of the\r\n    good reasons which the latter gave him.\r\n\r\n    \"We had been a month at sea, and we only wanted seven or\r\n    eight hours to reach the port of Tunis. Suddenly the wind\r\n    became so violent that we were obliged to stand out to sea,\r\n    and we remained three weeks without being able to touch the\r\n    port. Thereupon Monsieur once more reproached the captain\r\n    with having wasted thirty-six hours at the anchorage. It was\r\n    impossible to persuade him that a greater misfortune would\r\n    have befallen us if the captain had been less foreseeing.\r\n    The misfortune which I anticipated was to see our provisions\r\n    diminishing, without knowing when we should arrive.\"\r\n\r\nAt last I trod Carthaginian soil. I found the most generous hospitality\r\nat the hands of M. and Madame Devoise. Julien describes my host well;\r\nhe also speaks of the country and the Jews:\r\n\r\n\"They pray and weep,\" says he.\r\n\r\nAn American man-of-war brig gave me a passage on board, and I crossed\r\nthe lake of Tunis to go to the port.\r\n\r\n\"On the way,\" says Julien, \"I asked Monsieur if he had taken the gold\r\nwhich he had put into the writing-table in his bed-room; he told me he\r\nhad forgotten it, and I was obliged to return to Tunis.\"\r\n\r\nI can never keep money in my mind.\r\n\r\nWhen I arrived from Alexandria, we cast anchor opposite the ruins of\r\nthe city of Hannibal[699]. I looked at them from the deck without\r\nguessing what they were. I saw a few Moorish huts, a Mussulman\r\nhermitage on the point of a prominent head-land, some sheep grazing\r\namong ruins, ruins so unapparent that I could hardly distinguish them\r\nfrom the ground on which they stood: that was Carthage. I visited it\r\nbefore embarking for Europe.\r\n\r\n    MY ITINERARY.\r\n\r\n    \"From the top of Byrsa, the eye embraces the ruins of\r\n    Carthage, which are more numerous than is generally believed:\r\n    they resemble those of Sparta, having nothing in a good state\r\n    of preservation, but occupying a considerable space. I saw\r\n    them in the month of February; the fig-trees, olive-trees,\r\n    and carobs were already putting out their young leaves;\r\n    large angelicas and acanthas formed tufts of verdure among\r\n    the ruins of marble of every colour. In the distance, I\r\n    turned my gaze over the isthmus, a two-fold sea, far islands,\r\n    a smiling country-side, bluey lakes, azured mountains; I\r\n    descried forests, ships, aqueducts, Moorish villages,\r\n    Mohammedan hermitages, minarets, and the white houses of\r\n    Tunis. Millions of starlings, gathered into battalions and\r\n    resembling clouds, flew above my head. Surrounded by the\r\n    greatest and most touching memories, I thought of Dido[700],\r\n    of Sophonisba[701], of Hasdrubal's noble spouse[702]; I\r\n    viewed the vast plains in which the legions of Hannibal,\r\n    Scipio[703], and Cæsar[704] lie buried; my eyes tried to\r\n    recognise the site of the Palace of Utica. Alas, the remains\r\n    of the palace of Tiberius[705] still exist at Capri, and we\r\n    look in vain at Utica for the spot where stood Cato's[706]\r\n    house! Lastly, the terrible Vandals, the light Moors passed\r\n    in turn before my memory, which showed me, as a final\r\n    picture, St. Louis dying on the ruins of Carthage[707].\"\r\n\r\n*\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The ruins of Carthage.]\r\n\r\nJulien, like myself, takes his last view of Africa at Carthage[708].\r\n\r\nJulien briefly narrates our passage from Tunis to the Bay of Gibraltar;\r\nfrom Algeciras he promptly arrives at Cadiz, and from Cadiz at Granada.\r\nCareless of Blanca, he observes only that \"the Alhambra and other lofty\r\nbuildings stand on rocks of immense height.\" My own _Itinéraire_ does\r\nnot give many more details on Granada; I content myself with saying:\r\n\r\n\"The Alhambra seems to me to be worthy of note, even after the temples\r\nof Greece. The valley of Granada is delightful, and much resembles\r\nthat of Sparta: it is easy to conceive that the Moors regret so fine a\r\ncountry.\"\r\n\r\nI have described the Alhambra in the _Dernier des Abencerages._[709]\r\nThe Alhambra, the Generalife, the Monte-Santo are impressed upon my\r\nmind like those fantastic landscapes of which often, at peep of day,\r\none imagines that one catches a glimpse in the first brilliant ray of\r\nthe dawn. I still feel that I possess sufficient sense of nature to\r\npaint the Vega[710]; but I should not dare to attempt it, for fear\r\nof \"the Archbishop of Granada[711].\" During my stay in the town of\r\nthe sultanas, a guitar-player, driven by an earthquake from a village\r\nthrough which I had just passed, had devoted himself to me. Deaf as a\r\npost, he followed me wherever I went: when I sat down on a ruin in the\r\nPalace of the Moors, he stood and sang by my side, accompanying himself\r\non his guitar. The harmonious vagrant would not perhaps have composed\r\nthe symphony of the _Creation_[712], but his dusky skin showed through\r\nhis tattered cloak, and he would have had a great need to write as did\r\nBeethoven[713] to Fraülein Breuning:\r\n\r\n\"Revered Eleonora, my dearest friend, how gladly would I be the\r\npossessor of a rabbits'-wool waistcoat of your knitting.\"\r\n\r\nI travelled from end to end of that Spain in which, sixteen years\r\nlater, Heaven reserved to me a great part, that of aiding in stamping\r\nout anarchy in a noble nation and delivering a Bourbon: the honour of\r\nour arms was restored, and I should have saved the Legitimacy, had the\r\nLegitimacy been able to understand the conditions of its continuance.\r\n\r\nJulien does not allow me to escape until he has brought me back to\r\nthe Place Louis XV. at three o'clock in the afternoon of the 5th of\r\nJune 1807. From Granada he conducts me to Aranjuez, to Madrid, to the\r\nEscurial, whence he jumps to Bayonne.\r\n\r\n    \"We left Bayonne,\" he says, \"on Tuesday the 9th of May, for\r\n    Pau, Tarbes, Barèges and Bordeaux, where we arrived on the\r\n    18th, very tired, and both with a touch of fever. We left on\r\n    the 19th and went to Angoulême and Tours, and we arrived on\r\n    the 28th at Blois, where we slept. On the 31st we continued\r\n    our journey to Orleans, and later we spent our last night at\r\n    Angerville.\"\r\n\r\n*\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Back in France.]\r\n\r\nI was there, at one stage from a country-seat[714] whose inhabitants\r\nmy long voyage had not caused me to forget. But the gardens of Armida,\r\nwhere were they? Two or three times, when returning to the Pyrenees,\r\nI have caught sight of the Column of Méréville[715]; like Pompey's\r\nColumn, it acquainted me with the presence of the desert: like my\r\nfortunes at sea, all has changed.\r\n\r\nI reached Paris before the news I sent of myself: I had out-distanced\r\nmy life. Insignificant as are the letters which I wrote, I go\r\nthrough them as one looks over inferior sketches representing the\r\nplaces one has visited. Those notes, dated from Modon, Athens, Zea,\r\nConstantinople, Jaffa, Jerusalem, Alexandria, Tunis, Granada, Madrid,\r\nand Burgos, those lines written on every manner of paper, with every\r\nmanner of ink, carried by all the winds, interest me. I love unrolling\r\neven my very firmans: it is a pleasure to me to touch the vellum, to\r\nobserve the elegant caligraphy, to wonder at the pomp of the style.\r\nHow great a personage I must have been! And what poor devils we are,\r\nwith our letters and our forty-sou passports, beside those lords of the\r\nturban!\r\n\r\nOsman Seïd, Pasha of Morea, thus addresses to whomsoever it may concern\r\nmy firman for Athens:\r\n\r\n    \"Men of law of the townships of Misitra[716] and Argos,\r\n    cadis, nadirs, and eflendis, of whom may the wisdom ever\r\n    increase; you who are the honour of your peers and our\r\n    great men, vaïvodes, and you through whose eyes your master\r\n    sees, who replace him in each of your jurisdictions, public\r\n    officers and business men, whose credit can only grow greater.\r\n\r\n    \"We inform you that of the nobles of France, one noble in\r\n    particular from Paris, the bearer of this order, accompanied\r\n    by an armed janissary and by a servant as his escort, has\r\n    solicited permission and explained his intention to pass\r\n    through some of the places and localities which are within\r\n    your jurisdictions in order to go to Athens, which is an\r\n    isthmus lying beyond and separated from your jurisdictions.\r\n\r\n    \"Wherefore, effendis, vaïvodes, and all others\r\n    above-mentioned, when the aforesaid person shall arrive at\r\n    the places subject to your jurisdiction, you shall take the\r\n    greatest care that he be treated with all the particular\r\n    consideration of which friendship makes a law, etc., etc\r\n\r\n    \"Year 1221 of the Hegira.\"\r\n\r\nMy passport from Constantinople for Jerusalem says:\r\n\r\n    \"To the sublime tribunal of His Grandeur the Cadi of\r\n    Kouds[717], Scherif and Most Excellent Effendi:\r\n\r\n    \"Most Excellent Effendi, may Your Grandeur seated on your\r\n    august tribunal accept our sincere blessings and our\r\n    affectionate greetings.\r\n\r\n    \"We inform you that a noble personage from the Court of\r\n    France, named François Auguste de Chateaubriand, is at\r\n    present on his way towards you to make the _holy_ pilgrimage\r\n    (of the Christians).\"\r\n\r\nWould we extend a like protection to the unknown traveller with the\r\nmayors and gendarmes who inspect his passport? In these firmans we can\r\nalso read the revolutions of the nations: how many \"permits\" has it\r\nrequired that God should grant to the empires, before a Tartar slave\r\ncould lay orders upon a vaïvode of Misistra, that is, a magistrate of\r\nSparta; before a Mussulman could recommend a Christian to the Cadi of\r\nKouds, that is, of Jerusalem!\r\n\r\nThe _Itinéraire_ has entered into the elements that compose my life.\r\nWhen I set out in 1806, a pilgrimage to Jerusalem appeared a great\r\nundertaking. Now that the crowd has followed in my steps and that the\r\nwhole world is in the diligence, the wonder of it has vanished; I have\r\nlittle left of my own save Tunis: people have travelled less in that\r\ndirection, and it has been allowed that I pointed out the real sights\r\nof the ports of Carthage. This creditable letter proves it:\r\n\r\n    \"MONSIEUR LE VICOMTE,\r\n\r\n    \"I have just received a plan of the ground and ruins of\r\n    Carthage, giving the exact outlines and inclinations of the\r\n    soil; it has been taken trigonometrically on a basis of\r\n    1500 meters, and rests upon barometrical observations made\r\n    with corresponding barometers. It is a work of ten years\r\n    of precision and patience; and it confirms your opinions\r\n    regarding the position of the ports of Byrsa.\r\n\r\n    \"With this exact plan I have gone over all the ancient texts,\r\n    and have, I believe, determined the outer circumference and\r\n    the other portions of the Cothon, Byrsa, Megara, etc., etc.\r\n    I wish to do you the right which is your due upon so many\r\n    scores.\r\n\r\n    \"If you are not afraid to see me swoop down upon your genius\r\n    with my trigonometry and my heavy erudition, I will be with\r\n    you at the first sign from yourself. If we, my father[718]\r\n    and I, follow you in literature _longissimo intervallo_,\r\n    at least we shall have tried to imitate you in the noble\r\n    independence of which you set France so fine an example.\r\n\r\n    \"I have the honour to be, and I am proud of it, your frank\r\n    admirer,\r\n\r\n    \"DUREAU DE LA MALLE[719].\"\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: My geographical accuracy.]\r\n\r\nSo accurate a rectification of localities would formerly have been\r\nsufficient to give me a name in geography. From this time forward,\r\nif I still had a mania for being talked about, I do not know where\r\nI could go in order to attract the attention of the public: perhaps\r\nI should resume my old plan of discovering the passage to the North\r\nPole; perhaps I should ascend the Ganges. There I should see the long,\r\nstraight, dark line of the woods which defend the approach to the\r\nHimalayas; when, after reaching the neck which joins the two principal\r\npeaks of Mount Ganghur, I descried the immeasurable amphitheatre of\r\nthe eternal snows, and should ask my guides, as did Heber[720], the\r\nAnglican Bishop of Calcutta, the name of the other mountains in the\r\nEast, they would reply that they marked the border of the Chinese\r\nEmpire: well and good! But to return from the Pyramids is as though\r\nyou returned from Montlhéry[721]. By the by, I remember that a pious\r\nantiquary, who lived near Saint-Denis in France wrote to me to ask if\r\nPontoise did not resemble Jerusalem.\r\n\r\nThe last page of the _Itinéraire_ is as though I had written it this\r\nmoment, so exactly does it reproduce my present sentiments.\r\n\r\n    \"For twenty years,\" I said, \"I have devoted myself to study\r\n    amid hazards and troubles of every kind, _diversa exsilia et\r\n    desertas quærere terras_: many of the pages of my books have\r\n    been written under canvas, in the deserts, upon the ocean; I\r\n    have often held the pen without knowing how I should for a\r\n    few instants prolong my existence.... If Heaven grant me a\r\n    repose which I have never tasted, I will try in silence to\r\n    raise a monument to my country; if Providence refuse me that\r\n    repose, I must think only of shielding my last days from the\r\n    cares which have embittered the first. I am no longer young,\r\n    I no longer have the love of fame; I know that literature,\r\n    the commerce of which is so sweet when it is secret, only\r\n    draws down storms upon us from the outside. In any case, I\r\n    have written enough if my name is to live; far too much if it\r\n    is to die.\"\r\n\r\nIt is possible that my _Itinéraire_ may survive as a manual for the\r\nuse of Wandering Jews like myself: I have scrupulously noted the\r\nhalting-places, and drawn a map of the roads. All the travellers to\r\nJerusalem have written to congratulate me and thank me for my accuracy;\r\nI will quote one witness[722].\r\n\r\n*\r\n\r\nI see before me, of the sites of Syria, Egypt and Carthage, only\r\nthe spots in harmony with my solitary nature; these pleased me\r\nindependently of antiquity, art or history. The Pyramids struck me not\r\nso much on account of their size, as of the desert against which they\r\nwere set; Diocletian's Column did not catch my eye as did the segments\r\nof the sea along the sands of Lybia. At the Pelusian mouth of the Nile,\r\nI should not have wished fora monument to remind me of the scene thus\r\ndepicted by Plutarch:\r\n\r\n    \"The enfranchised slave, casting his eyes over the shore,\r\n    spied the old remains of a fishing-boat, which, though not\r\n    large, would make a sufficient pile for a poor naked body\r\n    that was not quite entire. While he was collecting the pieces\r\n    of plank, and putting them together, an old Roman, who had\r\n    made some of his first campaigns under Pompey, came up, and\r\n    said to Philip:\r\n\r\n    \"Who are you that are preparing the funeral of Pompey the\r\n    Great?'\r\n\r\n    \"Philip answered:\r\n\r\n    \"'I am his freedman.'\r\n\r\n    \"'But you shall not,' said the old Roman, 'have this honour\r\n    entirely to yourself. As a work of piety offers itself, let\r\n    me have a share in it; that I may not absolutely repent my\r\n    having passed so many years in a foreign country; but, to\r\n    compensate many misfortunes, may have the consolation of\r\n    doing some of the last honours to the greatest general Rome\r\n    ever produced[723].'\"\r\n\r\nCæsar's rival no longer has a tomb near Lybia, and a young Lybian\r\nslave-girl has received burial at the hands of a Pompey not far from\r\nthe Rome whence the great Pompey was banished. From these freaks of\r\nfortune one conceives how the Christians used to go and hide themselves\r\nin the Thebaïde[724].\r\n\r\nThe winds have scattered the personages of Europe, Asia, Africa,\r\namid whom I appeared and of whom I have told you: one fell from the\r\nAcropolis at Athens, another from the shore of Chios, another flung\r\nhimself from Mount Sion, yet another will never emerge from the waves\r\nof the Nile or the tanks of Carthage. The places themselves have\r\nchanged: in the same way, as in America, cities have sprung up where I\r\nsaw forests, an empire is being formed on those sands of Egypt where\r\nmy eyes encountered only \"horizons bare and rounded like the boss of a\r\nshield,\" as the Arab poems say, \"and wolves so thin that their jaws are\r\nlike a cleft stick.\" Greece has recovered the liberty which I wished\r\nher when travelling across her under the guard of a janissary. But\r\ndoes she enjoy her national liberty, or has she merely changed her yoke?\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The future of the East.]\r\n\r\nIn some measure I am the last visitor of the Turkish Empire under\r\nits old customs. The revolutions which have everywhere immediately\r\npreceded, or followed upon, my footsteps have spread over Greece,\r\nSyria, Egypt. Is a new East about to be formed? What will it bring\r\nforth? Shall we receive our just punishment for having taught\r\nthe modern art of warfare to nations whose social state is based\r\nupon slavery and polygamy? Have we carried civilization beyond\r\nour boundaries, or have we brought barbarism within the circle of\r\nChristianity? What will result from the new interests, the new\r\npolitical relations, the creation of the Powers which may spring up in\r\nthe Levant? No one can tell. I do not allow myself to be dazzled by\r\nsteam-boats and railways, by the sale of the produce of manufactures,\r\nand by the fortunes of a few French, English, German, Italian soldiers\r\nenrolled in a pasha's service: all that is not civilization. Perhaps we\r\nshall behold the return, through the aid of the disciplined troops of\r\nfuture Ibrahims, of the perils which threatened Europe at the time of\r\nCharles the Hammer[725], and from which we were saved by the generous\r\nPoland. I pity the travellers who shall succeed me: the harem will no\r\nlonger hide its secrets from them; they will not have seen the old sun\r\nof the East and the turban of Mahomet. The little Bedouin called out to\r\nme in French, when I passed into the mountains of Judæa:\r\n\r\n\"Forward, march!\"\r\n\r\nThe order was given, and the East marched.\r\n\r\n*\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _MEMENTO MORI._]\r\n\r\nWhat became of Ulysses' companion, Julien? He asked, when handing me\r\nhis manuscript, to be made _concierge_ of my house in the Rue d'Enfer:\r\nthis place was occupied by an old porter and his family, whom I could\r\nnot send away. The wrath of Heaven having made Julien headstrong and\r\na drunkard, I supported him for a long time; at last we were obliged\r\nto part. I gave him a small sum, and granted him a little pension on\r\nmy privy purse, a somewhat light one, but always copiously filled\r\nwith excellent notes mortgaged on my castles in Spain. I obtained\r\nJulien's admission, at his wish, to the Old Men's asylum: there\r\nhe finished the last great journey. I shall soon go to occupy his\r\nempty bed, even as, in the camp of Etnir-Capi, I slept on a mat from\r\nwhich a plague-stricken Mussulman had just been removed. My vocation\r\nis positively for the almshouse, in which the old society lies. It\r\npretends to live, but is none the less at death's door. When it has\r\nexpired, it will decompose in order to be reproduced under new forms,\r\nbut it must first succumb; the first necessity for peoples, as for man,\r\nis to die:\r\n\r\n\"When God bloweth, there cometh frost,\" says Job[726].\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[649] This book was written in Paris in 1839, and revised in December\r\n1846.--T.\r\n\r\n[650] Diane de Poitiers (1499-1566) was the daughter of Jean de\r\nPoitiers, Seigneur de Saint-Vallier, and married in 1512 Louis de\r\nBrézé, Comte de Maulevrier, who died in 1531. Some years later she\r\nbecame mistress to Henry II., then Duc d'Orléans, who shortly after\r\nhis accession created her Duchesse de Valentinois. She retained her\r\nempire over the King and her power in France until Henry's death, which\r\noccurred in 1559.--T.\r\n\r\n[651] Hervé Louis François Joseph Bonaventure Clérel, Comte de\r\nTocqueville (1772-1856) was made a peer of France and a prefect\r\nunder the Restoration. He was married to Mademoiselle de Rosanbo, a\r\ngrand-daughter of Malesherbes.--T.\r\n\r\n[652] Anne Nicole Marquise de Senozan (1718-1794), _née_ de Lamoignon\r\nde Blancménil, sister to Malesherbes and wife of the Président de\r\nSenozan. She mounted the scaffold on the 10th of May 1794, on the same\r\nday as Madame Élisabeth, at the age of seventy-six, and her estate\r\npassed later into the possession of her grand-nephew, the Comte de\r\nTocqueville.--B.\r\n\r\n[653] The Château de Verneuil in the Department of Seine-et-Oise.--B.\r\n\r\n[654] Alexis Charles Henri Clérel de Tocqueville (1805-1859) was\r\nappointed an assistant judge, and in 1831 was sent to America, in\r\ncompany with Gustave de Beaumont, to study the penal system on that\r\ncontinent. On his return he published a treatise on this subject, and\r\nin 1835 appeared his great work on American Democracy, which secured\r\nhis election to the Academy of Moral Science in 1839 and to the French\r\nAcademy in 1841. Two years earlier he had been sent to the Chamber\r\nas deputy for the Arrondissement of Valognes, in Normandy, in which\r\nhis father's property of Tocqueville was situated, and this seat he\r\nretained until his withdrawal from political life in 1851. He was\r\nMinister of Foreign Affairs under the Presidency of Louis Napoleon\r\nBonaparte from June to October 1849.--T.\r\n\r\n[655] Michel Lepelletier de Saint-Fargeau (1760-1793), a renegade\r\nrepresentative of the Paris nobility, which sent him to the\r\nStates-General in 1789. In 1792 he became a member of the Convention,\r\nwhere he voted in favour of the death of Louis XVI.; and on the 20th\r\nof January 1793, the day before the execution of the King, he was\r\nassassinated in a restaurant by an old Bodyguard called Paris. His body\r\nwas conveyed to the Pantheon in state, and the Convention adopted his\r\ndaughter, then eight years old.--T.\r\n\r\n[656] The Château du Ménil is in the commune of Fontenay-Saint-Père,\r\ncanton of Limay, Arrondissement of Mantes, Department of Seine-et-Oise.\r\nIt is now the property of M. le Marquis de Rosanbo.--B.\r\n\r\n[657] The Château de Mézy is in the canton of Meulan, Department of\r\nSeine-et-Oise.--B.\r\n\r\n[658] The Château de Méréville is in Beauce. It had formerly belonged\r\nto a celebrated Court banker, Jean Joseph de La Borde, guillotined in\r\n1794, who had turned it into a dwelling of finished splendour. The\r\npark, laid out by Robert, the landscape-painter, was a marvel. One of\r\nLa Borde's daughters had married the Comte de Noailles, later Duc de\r\nMouchy.--B.\r\n\r\n[659] Blanca is the heroine of the _Aventures du dernier\r\nAbencerage._--T.\r\n\r\n[660] Marie Anne Louise Adélaïde Marquise de Coislin (1732-1817), _née_\r\nde Mailly, of the Rubempré and Nesle branch, was the daughter of Louis\r\nde Mailly, Comte de Rubempré and cousin to the four Mesdemoiselles de\r\nMailly, daughters of the Marquis de Nesle--the Comtesse de Mailly, the\r\nComtesse de Vintimille, the Duchesse de Lauraguais, and the Marquise\r\nde La Tournelle, afterwards Duchesse de Châteauroux--who successively\r\nbecame mistresses to Louis XV. She married first, in 1750, Charles\r\nGeorges René de Cambout, Marquis de Coislin, who died in 1771, leaving\r\nno children living. More than twenty years later, in 1793, the Marquise\r\nde Coislin, then over sixty, married one of her cousins, twelve years\r\nyounger than herself, Louis Marie Duc de Mailly, who died and left her\r\na widow for the second time in 1795. There is reason to believe that\r\nthis marriage was never legally consecrated, as the Duchesse de Mailly\r\ncontinued to be called Marquise de Coislin.--B.\r\n\r\n[661] Now the Place de la Concorde. The house stands at the corner\r\nof the Rue Royale, facing the Ministry of Marine, formerly the Crown\r\nWardrobe.--T.\r\n\r\n[662] This title is the appanage of the Marquisate of Nesle.--T.\r\n\r\n[663] Killed at the Battle of Courtrai in 1302.--T.\r\n\r\n[664] Claude Joseph Vernet (1714-1789), the father of Carle and\r\ngrandfather of Horace Vernet. Louis XV. commissioned him to paint the\r\nprincipal French ports. The majority of his sea-pieces are now at the\r\nLouvre.--T.\r\n\r\n[665] Marie Anne de Mailly (1719-1744) married the Marquis de La\r\nTournelle in 1734. He left her a widow at the age of twenty-three,\r\nand she became mistress, in succession to her sisters Mesdames de\r\nVintimille and de Mailly, to Louis XV., who created her Duchesse de\r\nChâteauroux. She obtained the support of the Duc de Richelieu, and was\r\nfor a time all-powerful at Court, accompanying Louis at the head of\r\nhis armies in Flanders and Alsace. In 1744, when the King fell ill,\r\nshe was sent back to Paris in disgrace, but was restored to favour on\r\nhis recovery, and was on the point of becoming Superintendent of the\r\nDauphiness' Household, when she died a sudden death, attributed by some\r\nto poison.--T.\r\n\r\n[666] Louise Julie Comtesse de Mailly (1710-1751), the first of the\r\nNesle family to become the mistress of Louis XV. She amended her life\r\nwhen deserted in favour of one of her sisters, and was doubtless the\r\nmost estimable and sympathetic of the four.--T.\r\n\r\n[667] A reference to an epigram in the Anthology.--B.\r\n\r\n[668] Queen Marie Leczinska (1703-1768), daughter of Stanislaus\r\nLeczinski, ex-King of Poland, and married to Louis XV. in 1725.--T.\r\n\r\n[669] Madame Suard (1750-1830), _née_ Panckoucke, sister of Panckoucke,\r\nthe printer, founder of the _Moniteur universel_, and herself\r\nthe author of several agreeable works. Her salon was a favourite\r\nmeeting-place of the Encyclopædists under Louis XVI.--B.\r\n\r\n[670] Jean Baptiste Antoine Suard (1734-1817) took part in the editing\r\nof an English newspaper printed in Paris, became a member of the\r\nAcademy in 1772, and obtained a censorship in 1774. At the Revolution,\r\nhe became a moderate member of the new party. In 1803 he was appointed\r\nperpetual secretary to the Institute. His works consist mainly of\r\ntranslations from the English: Cook's _Voyages_, Robertson's _History\r\nof America_, etc.--T.\r\n\r\n[671] Pierre Michel Hennin (1728-1807) was Secretary of Embassy in\r\nPoland in 1759, Resident at Warsaw in 1763, Resident at Geneva in\r\n1765, and in 1779 became First Clerk at the Foreign Office, a post\r\nin which he did eminent service until 1792, when he was dismissed by\r\nGeneral Dumouriez. He was obliged to sell his collections, and took to\r\n\"scribbling fat novels\" for a livelihood, working at learning languages\r\nand at his writing until his death, on the 5th of July 1807, at the age\r\nof nearly eighty.--B.\r\n\r\n[672] Claude Antoine de Bésiade, Duc d'Avaray (1740-1829), brother to\r\nthe Comte d'Avaray, Louis XVIII.'s companion in exile and chief agent.\r\nD'Avaray was imprisoned during the Terror, recovered his liberty on the\r\n9 Thermidor, and emigrated, returning to France in 1814. Louis XVIII.\r\nraised him to the peerage in 1815, created him a duke in 1817, and made\r\nhim his First Chamberlain in 1820.--B.\r\n\r\n[673] _Cinq jours à Clermont (Auvergne) 2, 3, 4, 5 et 6 août_ 1805 and\r\n_Le Mont-Blanc, paysages de montagnes, fin d'août_ 1805. They appear in\r\nVol. VI. of the complete works.--B.\r\n\r\n[674] Honoré d'Urfé (1567-1625), after a life spent in war and\r\ndiplomacy, wrote the famous pastoral romance of the _Astrée_, in which\r\nhe depicted the happiness of the shepherds of the Lignon. The singular\r\nbook was received with the greatest favour, and gave rise to a whole\r\nschool of bucolic novelists. D'Urfé died before completing his work,\r\nand his secretary, Baro, finished it from the author's manuscripts or\r\nhis own imagination.--T.\r\n\r\n[675] Claude Ignace Brugière de Barante (1745-1814). Napoleon dismissed\r\nhim because of the indulgence shown by him to Madame de Staël, and he\r\ndied at the moment when the return of the Bourbons appeared to promise\r\nhim a just reparation.--B.\r\n\r\n[676] Louis Nicolas Philippe Auguste Comte de Forbin (1779-1841), a\r\nsuccessful writer and painter, and a member of the Academy of Fine\r\nArts. Under the Restoration he became Director of the Museums.--T.\r\n\r\n[677] Mathurin Régnier (1573-1613), the first of the French satiric\r\npoets.

St. Cyprian is honoured on the 16th of September.--T.\r\n\r\n[686] Eustache Le Sueur (1617-1655), known as the French Raphael, the\r\nfirst painter of the French school under Louis XIV. Persecuted by his\r\nenvious rivals, he retired to the Chartreuse on the death of his wife,\r\nand painted for the monastery his greatest work, the Life of St. Bruno,\r\nin twenty-two pictures.--T.\r\n\r\n[687] St. Bruno (_circa_ 1040-1101), Founder of the Carthusian Order,\r\nand honoured on the 6th of October.--T.\r\n\r\n[688] The certificate of death has since been discovered. Madame de\r\nCaud died in the Marais, at No. 6, Rue d'Orléans, on the 18 Brumaire,\r\nYear XIII (9 November 1804).--B.\r\n\r\n[689] On the 13th of November 1804, Chateaubriand, who was then staying\r\nat Villeneuve-sur-Yonne with his friend Joubert, wrote to Chênedollé:\r\n\r\n    \"Madame de Caud is no more. She died in Paris on the 9th. We\r\n    have lost the most beautiful soul, the most exalted genius,\r\n    that ever existed. You see that I am born for every sorrow.\r\n    In how few days has Lucile gone to join Pauline [Madame\r\n    de Beaumont]! Come, my dear friend, and weep with me this\r\n    winter, in January. You will find a man who is inconsolable,\r\n    but who is your friend for life.--Joubert sends you a million\r\n    loves.\"--B.\r\n\r\n[690] Chateaubriand's family at that date comprised Madame la Comtesse\r\nde Marigny; Madame la Comtesse de Chateaubourg, and their children; the\r\ndaughter of the Comtesse Julie de Farcy; and the sons of the Comte de\r\nChateaubriand.--B.\r\n\r\n[691] The juxtaposition of the names of Julien and Clarke, is somewhat\r\nforced. Edward Clarke was not Cook's valet, but his companion and his\r\nrival in fame. He three times circumnavigated the world. Both left\r\nPlymouth together, on the 12th of July 1776, Captain Cook commanding\r\nthe _Discovery_ and Captain Clarke the _Resolution._ After the death of\r\nCook, killed by the natives of Owhyhee, on the 14th of February 1779,\r\nClarke succeeded him in the command of the expedition, and himself died\r\nas he was arriving in Kamchatka. The _Discovery_ and the _Resolution_\r\nreturned to England on the 4th of October 1780.--B.\r\n\r\n[692] I omit a portion of the extracts from the servant's Itinerary.\r\nThese will be indicated in their places.--T.\r\n\r\n[693] At Trieste.--T.\r\n\r\n[694] _De Sparte et d'Athènes._--_Author's Note._\r\n\r\n[695] I omit Julien's description of the streets of Constantinople.--T.\r\n\r\n[696] I omit a quotation from Julien's narrative.--T.\r\n\r\n[697] I omit Julien's observations here.--T.\r\n\r\n[698] I omit a quotation from Julien's Itinerary.--T.\r\n\r\n[699] Hannibal (247-183 B.C.), the famous Carthaginian general.--T.\r\n\r\n[700] Dido Queen of Tyre founded Carthage _circa_ 860 B.C.--T.\r\n\r\n[701] Sophonisba (235-203 B.C.), daughter of the third Hasdrubal,\r\nwas betrothed to Masinissa King of Massylia and Numidia, but married\r\nin his stead his rival Syphax. Masinissa recaptured his domains from\r\nthe latter, and with them his wife, whom he married. When Scipio,\r\nhowever, insisted upon Sophonisba's appearance in his triumph in Rome,\r\nMasinissa, to save her from this disgrace, sent her poison. Her story\r\nis the subject of one of Voltaire's tragedies.--T.\r\n\r\n[702] When the fourth Hasdrubal (170-100 B.C.), then commander of\r\nCarthage, surrendered to Scipio, his wife, horrified at his treachery,\r\nkilled her children before his eyes, and then threw herself into the\r\nflames, 146 B.C.--T.\r\n\r\n[703] Publius Cornelius Scipio Africanus (_circa_ 235-184 B.C.).--T.\r\n\r\n[704] Caius Julius Cæsar (100-44 B.C.) defeated Metellus Scipio and\r\nCato at Carthage in 46 B.C.--T.\r\n\r\n[705] Tiberius Claudius Nero (42 B.C.-37 A.D.), the second Roman\r\nEmperor.
