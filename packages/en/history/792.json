  "content": "WIELAND; OR THE TRANSFORMATION\r\n\r\nAn American Tale\r\n\r\nby Charles Brockden Brown\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n          From Virtue's blissful paths away\r\n          The double-tongued are sure to stray;\r\n          Good is a forth-right journey still,\r\n          And mazy paths but lead to ill.\r\n\r\n\r\nAdvertisement.\r\n\r\nThe following Work is delivered to the world as the first of a series\r\nof performances, which the favorable reception of this will induce the\r\nWriter to publish. His purpose is neither selfish nor temporary,\r\nbut aims at the illustration of some important branches of the moral\r\nconstitution of man. Whether this tale will be classed with the ordinary\r\nor frivolous sources of amusement, or be ranked with the few productions\r\nwhose usefulness secures to them a lasting reputation, the reader must\r\nbe permitted to decide.\r\n\r\nThe incidents related are extraordinary and rare. Some of them, perhaps,\r\napproach as nearly to the nature of miracles as can be done by that\r\nwhich is not truly miraculous. It is hoped that intelligent readers will\r\nnot disapprove of the manner in which appearances are solved, but that\r\nthe solution will be found to correspond with the known principles of\r\nhuman nature. The power which the principal person is said to possess\r\ncan scarcely be denied to be real. It must be acknowledged to be\r\nextremely rare; but no fact, equally uncommon, is supported by the same\r\nstrength of historical evidence.\r\n\r\nSome readers may think the conduct of the younger Wieland impossible. In\r\nsupport of its possibility the Writer must appeal to Physicians and to\r\nmen conversant with the latent springs and occasional perversions of\r\nthe human mind. It will not be objected that the instances of similar\r\ndelusion are rare, because it is the business of moral painters to\r\nexhibit their subject in its most instructive and memorable forms. If\r\nhistory furnishes one parallel fact, it is a sufficient vindication of\r\nthe Writer; but most readers will probably recollect an authentic case,\r\nremarkably similar to that of Wieland.\r\n\r\nIt will be necessary to add, that this narrative is addressed, in an\r\nepistolary form, by the Lady whose story it contains, to a small\r\nnumber of friends, whose curiosity, with regard to it, had been greatly\r\nawakened. It may likewise be mentioned, that these events took\r\nplace between the conclusion of the French and the beginning of the\r\nrevolutionary war. The memoirs of Carwin, alluded to at the conclusion\r\nof the work, will be published or suppressed according to the reception\r\nwhich is given to the present attempt.\r\n\r\nC. B. B. September 3, 1798.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter I\r\n\r\n\r\nI feel little reluctance in complying with your request. You know not\r\nfully the cause of my sorrows. You are a stranger to the depth of my\r\ndistresses. Hence your efforts at consolation must necessarily fail. Yet\r\nthe tale that I am going to tell is not intended as a claim upon your\r\nsympathy. In the midst of my despair, I do not disdain to contribute\r\nwhat little I can to the benefit of mankind. I acknowledge your right to\r\nbe informed of the events that have lately happened in my family. Make\r\nwhat use of the tale you shall think proper. If it be communicated\r\nto the world, it will inculcate the duty of avoiding deceit. It will\r\nexemplify the force of early impressions, and show the immeasurable\r\nevils that flow from an erroneous or imperfect discipline.\r\n\r\nMy state is not destitute of tranquillity. The sentiment that dictates\r\nmy feelings is not hope. Futurity has no power over my thoughts. To all\r\nthat is to come I am perfectly indifferent. With regard to myself, I\r\nhave nothing more to fear. Fate has done its worst. Henceforth, I am\r\ncallous to misfortune.\r\n\r\nI address no supplication to the Deity. The power that governs the\r\ncourse of human affairs has chosen his path. The decree that ascertained\r\nthe condition of my life, admits of no recal. No doubt it squares with\r\nthe maxims of eternal equity. That is neither to be questioned nor\r\ndenied by me. It suffices that the past is exempt from mutation. The\r\nstorm that tore up our happiness, and changed into dreariness and desert\r\nthe blooming scene of our existence, is lulled into grim repose; but\r\nnot until the victim was transfixed and mangled; till every obstacle was\r\ndissipated by its rage; till every remnant of good was wrested from our\r\ngrasp and exterminated.\r\n\r\nHow will your wonder, and that of your companions, be excited by my\r\nstory! Every sentiment will yield to your amazement. If my testimony\r\nwere without corroborations, you would reject it as incredible. The\r\nexperience of no human being can furnish a parallel: That I, beyond the\r\nrest of mankind, should be reserved for a destiny without alleviation,\r\nand without example! Listen to my narrative, and then say what it is\r\nthat has made me deserve to be placed on this dreadful eminence, if,\r\nindeed, every faculty be not suspended in wonder that I am still alive,\r\nand am able to relate it. My father's ancestry was noble on the paternal\r\nside; but his mother was the daughter of a merchant. My grand-father was\r\na younger brother, and a native of Saxony. He was placed, when he had\r\nreached the suitable age, at a German college. During the vacations,\r\nhe employed himself in traversing the neighbouring territory. On one\r\noccasion it was his fortune to visit Hamburg. He formed an acquaintance\r\nwith Leonard Weise, a merchant of that city, and was a frequent guest\r\nat his house. The merchant had an only daughter, for whom his guest\r\nspeedily contracted an affection; and, in spite of parental menaces and\r\nprohibitions, he, in due season, became her husband.\r\n\r\nBy this act he mortally offended his relations. Thenceforward he was\r\nentirely disowned and rejected by them. They refused to contribute any\r\nthing to his support. All intercourse ceased, and he received from them\r\nmerely that treatment to which an absolute stranger, or detested enemy,\r\nwould be entitled.\r\n\r\nHe found an asylum in the house of his new father, whose temper was\r\nkind, and whose pride was flattered by this alliance. The nobility of\r\nhis birth was put in the balance against his poverty. Weise conceived\r\nhimself, on the whole, to have acted with the highest discretion, in\r\nthus disposing of his child. My grand-father found it incumbent on him\r\nto search out some mode of independent subsistence. His youth had\r\nbeen eagerly devoted to literature and music. These had hitherto been\r\ncultivated merely as sources of amusement. They were now converted into\r\nthe means of gain. At this period there were few works of taste in\r\nthe Saxon dialect. My ancestor may be considered as the founder of the\r\nGerman Theatre. The modern poet of the same name is sprung from the same\r\nfamily, and, perhaps, surpasses but little, in the fruitfulness of his\r\ninvention, or the soundness of his taste, the elder Wieland. His life\r\nwas spent in the composition of sonatas and dramatic pieces. They were\r\nnot unpopular, but merely afforded him a scanty subsistence. He died\r\nin the bloom of his life, and was quickly followed to the grave by his\r\nwife. Their only child was taken under the protection of the merchant.\r\nAt an early age he was apprenticed to a London trader, and passed seven\r\nyears of mercantile servitude.\r\n\r\nMy father was not fortunate in the character of him under whose care\r\nhe was now placed. He was treated with rigor, and full employment was\r\nprovided for every hour of his time. His duties were laborious and\r\nmechanical. He had been educated with a view to this profession, and,\r\ntherefore, was not tormented with unsatisfied desires. He did not hold\r\nhis present occupations in abhorrence, because they withheld him from\r\npaths more flowery and more smooth, but he found in unintermitted\r\nlabour, and in the sternness of his master, sufficient occasions for\r\ndiscontent. No opportunities of recreation were allowed him. He spent\r\nall his time pent up in a gloomy apartment, or traversing narrow and\r\ncrowded streets. His food was coarse, and his lodging humble. His heart\r\ngradually contracted a habit of morose and gloomy reflection. He could\r\nnot accurately define what was wanting to his happiness. He was not\r\ntortured by comparisons drawn between his own situation and that\r\nof others. His state was such as suited his age and his views as to\r\nfortune. He did not imagine himself treated with extraordinary or\r\nunjustifiable rigor. In this respect he supposed the condition of\r\nothers, bound like himself to mercantile service, to resemble his own;\r\nyet every engagement was irksome, and every hour tedious in its lapse.\r\n\r\nIn this state of mind he chanced to light upon a book written by one of\r\nthe teachers of the Albigenses, or French Protestants. He entertained no\r\nrelish for books, and was wholly unconscious of any power they possessed\r\nto delight or instruct. This volume had lain for years in a corner of\r\nhis garret, half buried in dust and rubbish. He had marked it as it lay;\r\nhad thrown it, as his occasions required, from one spot to another; but\r\nhad felt no inclination to examine its contents, or even to inquire what\r\nwas the subject of which it treated.\r\n\r\nOne Sunday afternoon, being induced to retire for a few minutes to his\r\ngarret, his eye was attracted by a page of this book, which, by some\r\naccident, had been opened and placed full in his view. He was seated on\r\nthe edge of his bed, and was employed in repairing a rent in some part\r\nof his clothes. His eyes were not confined to his work, but occasionally\r\nwandering, lighted at length upon the page. The words \"Seek and ye\r\nshall find,\" were those that first offered themselves to his notice.\r\nHis curiosity was roused by these so far as to prompt him to proceed.\r\nAs soon as he finished his work, he took up the book and turned to\r\nthe first page. The further he read, the more inducement he found to\r\ncontinue, and he regretted the decline of the light which obliged him\r\nfor the present to close it.\r\n\r\nThe book contained an exposition of the doctrine of the sect of\r\nCamissards, and an historical account of its origin. His mind was in a\r\nstate peculiarly fitted for the reception of devotional sentiments. The\r\ncraving which had haunted him was now supplied with an object. His mind\r\nwas at no loss for a theme of meditation. On days of business, he rose\r\nat the dawn, and retired to his chamber not till late at night. He now\r\nsupplied himself with candles, and employed his nocturnal and Sunday\r\nhours in studying this book. It, of course, abounded with allusions to\r\nthe Bible. All its conclusions were deduced from the sacred text. This\r\nwas the fountain, beyond which it was unnecessary to trace the stream of\r\nreligious truth; but it was his duty to trace it thus far.\r\n\r\nA Bible was easily procured, and he ardently entered on the study of it.\r\nHis understanding had received a particular direction. All his reveries\r\nwere fashioned in the same mould. His progress towards the formation of\r\nhis creed was rapid. Every fact and sentiment in this book were viewed\r\nthrough a medium which the writings of the Camissard apostle had\r\nsuggested. His constructions of the text were hasty, and formed on a\r\nnarrow scale. Every thing was viewed in a disconnected position. One\r\naction and one precept were not employed to illustrate and restrict\r\nthe meaning of another. Hence arose a thousand scruples to which he had\r\nhitherto been a stranger. He was alternately agitated by fear and by\r\necstacy. He imagined himself beset by the snares of a spiritual foe, and\r\nthat his security lay in ceaseless watchfulness and prayer.\r\n\r\nHis morals, which had never been loose, were now modelled by a stricter\r\nstandard. The empire of religious duty extended itself to his looks,\r\ngestures, and phrases. All levities of speech, and negligences of\r\nbehaviour, were proscribed. His air was mournful and contemplative.\r\nHe laboured to keep alive a sentiment of fear, and a belief of\r\nthe awe-creating presence of the Deity. Ideas foreign to this were\r\nsedulously excluded. To suffer their intrusion was a crime against the\r\nDivine Majesty inexpiable but by days and weeks of the keenest agonies.\r\n\r\nNo material variation had occurred in the lapse of two years. Every day\r\nconfirmed him in his present modes of thinking and acting. It was to\r\nbe expected that the tide of his emotions would sometimes recede, that\r\nintervals of despondency and doubt would occur; but these gradually were\r\nmore rare, and of shorter duration; and he, at last, arrived at a state\r\nconsiderably uniform in this respect.\r\n\r\nHis apprenticeship was now almost expired. On his arrival of age he\r\nbecame entitled, by the will of my grand-father, to a small sum. This\r\nsum would hardly suffice to set him afloat as a trader in his present\r\nsituation, and he had nothing to expect from the generosity of his\r\nmaster. Residence in England had, besides, become almost impossible,\r\non account of his religious tenets. In addition to these motives for\r\nseeking a new habitation, there was another of the most imperious and\r\nirresistable necessity. He had imbibed an opinion that it was his duty\r\nto disseminate the truths of the gospel among the unbelieving nations.\r\nHe was terrified at first by the perils and hardships to which the life\r\nof a missionary is exposed. This cowardice made him diligent in the\r\ninvention of objections and excuses; but he found it impossible wholly\r\nto shake off the belief that such was the injunction of his duty.\r\nThe belief, after every new conflict with his passions, acquired new\r\nstrength; and, at length, he formed a resolution of complying with what\r\nhe deemed the will of heaven.\r\n\r\nThe North-American Indians naturally presented themselves as the first\r\nobjects for this species of benevolence. As soon as his servitude\r\nexpired, he converted his little fortune into money, and embarked for\r\nPhiladelphia. Here his fears were revived, and a nearer survey of savage\r\nmanners once more shook his resolution. For a while he relinquished his\r\npurpose, and purchasing a farm on Schuylkill, within a few miles of the\r\ncity, set himself down to the cultivation of it. The cheapness of land,\r\nand the service of African slaves, which were then in general use,\r\ngave him who was poor in Europe all the advantages of wealth. He passed\r\nfourteen years in a thrifty and laborious manner. In this time new\r\nobjects, new employments, and new associates appeared to have nearly\r\nobliterated the devout impressions of his youth. He now became\r\nacquainted with a woman of a meek and quiet disposition, and of slender\r\nacquirements like himself. He proffered his hand and was accepted.\r\n\r\nHis previous industry had now enabled him to dispense with personal\r\nlabour, and direct attention to his own concerns. He enjoyed leisure,\r\nand was visited afresh by devotional contemplation. The reading of the\r\nscriptures, and other religious books, became once more his favorite\r\nemployment. His ancient belief relative to the conversion of the savage\r\ntribes, was revived with uncommon energy. To the former obstacles were\r\nnow added the pleadings of parental and conjugal love. The struggle\r\nwas long and vehement; but his sense of duty would not be stifled or\r\nenfeebled, and finally triumphed over every impediment.\r\n\r\nHis efforts were attended with no permanent success. His exhortations\r\nhad sometimes a temporary power, but more frequently were repelled with\r\ninsult and derision. In pursuit of this object he encountered the most\r\nimminent perils, and underwent incredible fatigues, hunger, sickness,\r\nand solitude. The licence of savage passion, and the artifices of his\r\ndepraved countrymen, all opposed themselves to his progress. His courage\r\ndid not forsake him till there appeared no reasonable ground to hope for\r\nsuccess. He desisted not till his heart was relieved from the supposed\r\nobligation to persevere. With his constitution somewhat decayed, he at\r\nlength returned to his family. An interval of tranquillity succeeded. He\r\nwas frugal, regular, and strict in the performance of domestic duties.\r\nHe allied himself with no sect, because he perfectly agreed with none.\r\nSocial worship is that by which they are all distinguished; but this\r\narticle found no place in his creed. He rigidly interpreted that precept\r\nwhich enjoins us, when we worship, to retire into solitude, and shut\r\nout every species of society. According to him devotion was not only a\r\nsilent office, but must be performed alone. An hour at noon, and an hour\r\nat midnight were thus appropriated.\r\n\r\nAt the distance of three hundred yards from his house, on the top of a\r\nrock whose sides were steep, rugged, and encumbered with dwarf cedars\r\nand stony asperities, he built what to a common eye would have seemed a\r\nsummer-house. The eastern verge of this precipice was sixty feet above\r\nthe river which flowed at its foot. The view before it consisted of a\r\ntransparent current, fluctuating and rippling in a rocky channel, and\r\nbounded by a rising scene of cornfields and orchards. The edifice was\r\nslight and airy. It was no more than a circular area, twelve feet in\r\ndiameter, whose flooring was the rock, cleared of moss and shrubs, and\r\nexactly levelled, edged by twelve Tuscan columns, and covered by an\r\nundulating dome. My father furnished the dimensions and outlines, but\r\nallowed the artist whom he employed to complete the structure on his own\r\nplan. It was without seat, table, or ornament of any kind.\r\n\r\nThis was the temple of his Deity. Twice in twenty-four hours he repaired\r\nhither, unaccompanied by any human being. Nothing but physical inability\r\nto move was allowed to obstruct or postpone this visit. He did not exact\r\nfrom his family compliance with his example. Few men, equally sincere\r\nin their faith, were as sparing in their censures and restrictions,\r\nwith respect to the conduct of others, as my father. The character of\r\nmy mother was no less devout; but her education had habituated her to\r\na different mode of worship. The loneliness of their dwelling prevented\r\nher from joining any established congregation; but she was punctual in\r\nthe offices of prayer, and in the performance of hymns to her Saviour,\r\nafter the manner of the disciples of Zinzendorf. My father refused\r\nto interfere in her arrangements. His own system was embraced not,\r\naccurately speaking, because it was the best, but because it had been\r\nexpressly prescribed to him. Other modes, if practised by other persons,\r\nmight be equally acceptable.\r\n\r\nHis deportment to others was full of charity and mildness. A sadness\r\nperpetually overspread his features, but was unmingled with sternness or\r\ndiscontent. The tones of his voice, his gestures, his steps were all in\r\ntranquil unison. His conduct was characterised by a certain forbearance\r\nand humility, which secured the esteem of those to whom his tenets were\r\nmost obnoxious. They might call him a fanatic and a dreamer, but they\r\ncould not deny their veneration to his invincible candour and invariable\r\nintegrity. His own belief of rectitude was the foundation of his\r\nhappiness. This, however, was destined to find an end.\r\n\r\nSuddenly the sadness that constantly attended him was deepened. Sighs,\r\nand even tears, sometimes escaped him. To the expostulations of his wife\r\nhe seldom answered any thing. When he designed to be communicative, he\r\nhinted that his peace of mind was flown, in consequence of deviation\r\nfrom his duty. A command had been laid upon him, which he had delayed to\r\nperform. He felt as if a certain period of hesitation and reluctance\r\nhad been allowed him, but that this period was passed. He was no\r\nlonger permitted to obey. The duty assigned to him was transferred, in\r\nconsequence of his disobedience, to another, and all that remained was\r\nto endure the penalty.\r\n\r\nHe did not describe this penalty. It appeared to be nothing more for\r\nsome time than a sense of wrong. This was sufficiently acute, and was\r\naggravated by the belief that his offence was incapable of expiation. No\r\none could contemplate the agonies which he seemed to suffer without the\r\ndeepest compassion. Time, instead of lightening the burthen, appeared to\r\nadd to it. At length he hinted to his wife, that his end was near. His\r\nimagination did not prefigure the mode or the time of his decease, but\r\nwas fraught with an incurable persuasion that his death was at hand. He\r\nwas likewise haunted by the belief that the kind of death that awaited\r\nhim was strange and terrible. His anticipations were thus far vague and\r\nindefinite; but they sufficed to poison every moment of his being, and\r\ndevote him to ceaseless anguish.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter II\r\n\r\n\r\nEarly in the morning of a sultry day in August, he left Mettingen, to go\r\nto the city. He had seldom passed a day from home since his return from\r\nthe shores of the Ohio. Some urgent engagements at this time existed,\r\nwhich would not admit of further delay. He returned in the evening, but\r\nappeared to be greatly oppressed with fatigue. His silence and dejection\r\nwere likewise in a more than ordinary degree conspicuous. My mother's\r\nbrother, whose profession was that of a surgeon, chanced to spend this\r\nnight at our house. It was from him that I have frequently received an\r\nexact account of the mournful catastrophe that followed.\r\n\r\nAs the evening advanced, my father's inquietudes increased. He sat with\r\nhis family as usual, but took no part in their conversation. He appeared\r\nfully engrossed by his own reflections. Occasionally his countenance\r\nexhibited tokens of alarm; he gazed stedfastly and wildly at the\r\nceiling; and the exertions of his companions were scarcely sufficient\r\nto interrupt his reverie. On recovering from these fits, he expressed no\r\nsurprize; but pressing his hand to his head, complained, in a tremulous\r\nand terrified tone, that his brain was scorched to cinders. He would\r\nthen betray marks of insupportable anxiety.\r\n\r\nMy uncle perceived, by his pulse, that he was indisposed, but in no\r\nalarming degree, and ascribed appearances chiefly to the workings of his\r\nmind. He exhorted him to recollection and composure, but in vain. At the\r\nhour of repose he readily retired to his chamber. At the persuasion of\r\nmy mother he even undressed and went to bed. Nothing could abate his\r\nrestlessness. He checked her tender expostulations with some sternness.\r\n\"Be silent,\" said he, \"for that which I feel there is but one cure,\r\nand that will shortly come. You can help me nothing. Look to your own\r\ncondition, and pray to God to strengthen you under the calamities that\r\nawait you.\" \"What am I to fear?\" she answered. \"What terrible disaster\r\nis it that you think of?\" \"Peace--as yet I know it not myself, but come\r\nit will, and shortly.\" She repeated her inquiries and doubts; but he\r\nsuddenly put an end to the discourse, by a stern command to be silent.\r\n\r\nShe had never before known him in this mood. Hitherto all was benign in\r\nhis deportment. Her heart was pierced with sorrow at the contemplation\r\nof this change. She was utterly unable to account for it, or to figure\r\nto herself the species of disaster that was menaced.\r\n\r\nContrary to custom, the lamp, instead of being placed on the hearth, was\r\nleft upon the table. Over it against the wall there hung a small clock,\r\nso contrived as to strike a very hard stroke at the end of every sixth\r\nhour. That which was now approaching was the signal for retiring to the\r\nfane at which he addressed his devotions. Long habit had occasioned him\r\nto be always awake at this hour, and the toll was instantly obeyed.\r\n\r\nNow frequent and anxious glances were cast at the clock. Not a single\r\nmovement of the index appeared to escape his notice. As the hour verged\r\ntowards twelve his anxiety visibly augmented. The trepidations of my\r\nmother kept pace with those of her husband; but she was intimidated\r\ninto silence. All that was left to her was to watch every change of his\r\nfeatures, and give vent to her sympathy in tears.\r\n\r\nAt length the hour was spent, and the clock tolled. The sound appeared\r\nto communicate a shock to every part of my father's frame. He rose\r\nimmediately, and threw over himself a loose gown. Even this office\r\nwas performed with difficulty, for his joints trembled, and his teeth\r\nchattered with dismay. At this hour his duty called him to the rock, and\r\nmy mother naturally concluded that it was thither he intended to repair.\r\nYet these incidents were so uncommon, as to fill her with astonishment\r\nand foreboding. She saw him leave the room, and heard his steps as they\r\nhastily descended the stairs. She half resolved to rise and pursue him,\r\nbut the wildness of the scheme quickly suggested itself. He was going\r\nto a place whither no power on earth could induce him to suffer an\r\nattendant.\r\n\r\nThe window of her chamber looked toward the rock. The atmosphere was\r\nclear and calm, but the edifice could not be discovered at that distance\r\nthrough the dusk. My mother's anxiety would not allow her to remain\r\nwhere she was. She rose, and seated herself at the window. She strained\r\nher sight to get a view of the dome, and of the path that led to it. The\r\nfirst painted itself with sufficient distinctness on her fancy, but\r\nwas undistinguishable by the eye from the rocky mass on which it was\r\nerected. The second could be imperfectly seen; but her husband had\r\nalready passed, or had taken a different direction.\r\n\r\nWhat was it that she feared? Some disaster impended over her husband or\r\nherself. He had predicted evils, but professed himself ignorant of what\r\nnature they were. When were they to come? Was this night, or this hour\r\nto witness the accomplishment? She was tortured with impatience, and\r\nuncertainty. All her fears were at present linked to his person, and she\r\ngazed at the clock, with nearly as much eagerness as my father had done,\r\nin expectation of the next hour.\r\n\r\nAn half hour passed away in this state of suspence. Her eyes were fixed\r\nupon the rock; suddenly it was illuminated. A light proceeding from the\r\nedifice, made every part of the scene visible. A gleam diffused itself\r\nover the intermediate space, and instantly a loud report, like the\r\nexplosion of a mine, followed. She uttered an involuntary shriek, but\r\nthe new sounds that greeted her ear, quickly conquered her surprise.\r\nThey were piercing shrieks, and uttered without intermission. The gleams\r\nwhich had diffused themselves far and wide were in a moment withdrawn,\r\nbut the interior of the edifice was filled with rays.\r\n\r\nThe first suggestion was that a pistol was discharged, and that the\r\nstructure was on fire. She did not allow herself time to meditate a\r\nsecond thought, but rushed into the entry and knocked loudly at the door\r\nof her brother's chamber. My uncle had been previously roused by the\r\nnoise, and instantly flew to the window. He also imagined what he saw\r\nto be fire. The loud and vehement shrieks which succeeded the first\r\nexplosion, seemed to be an invocation of succour. The incident was\r\ninexplicable; but he could not fail to perceive the propriety of\r\nhastening to the spot. He was unbolting the door, when his sister's\r\nvoice was heard on the outside conjuring him to come forth.\r\n\r\nHe obeyed the summons with all the speed in his power. He stopped not\r\nto question her, but hurried down stairs and across the meadow which lay\r\nbetween the house and the rock. The shrieks were no longer to be heard;\r\nbut a blazing light was clearly discernible between the columns of the\r\ntemple. Irregular steps, hewn in the stone, led him to the summit. On\r\nthree sides, this edifice touched the very verge of the cliff. On the\r\nfourth side, which might be regarded as the front, there was an area\r\nof small extent, to which the rude staircase conducted you. My uncle\r\nspeedily gained this spot. His strength was for a moment exhausted\r\nby his haste. He paused to rest himself. Meanwhile he bent the most\r\nvigilant attention towards the object before him.\r\n\r\nWithin the columns he beheld what he could no better describe, than\r\nby saying that it resembled a cloud impregnated with light. It had\r\nthe brightness of flame, but was without its upward motion. It did not\r\noccupy the whole area, and rose but a few feet above the floor. No\r\npart of the building was on fire. This appearance was astonishing. He\r\napproached the temple. As he went forward the light retired, and, when\r\nhe put his feet within the apartment, utterly vanished. The suddenness\r\nof this transition increased the darkness that succeeded in a tenfold\r\ndegree. Fear and wonder rendered him powerless. An occurrence like this,\r\nin a place assigned to devotion, was adapted to intimidate the stoutest\r\nheart.\r\n\r\nHis wandering thoughts were recalled by the groans of one near him.\r\nHis sight gradually recovered its power, and he was able to discern my\r\nfather stretched on the floor. At that moment, my mother and servants\r\narrived with a lanthorn, and enabled my uncle to examine more closely\r\nthis scene. My father, when he left the house, besides a loose upper\r\nvest and slippers, wore a shirt and drawers. Now he was naked, his skin\r\nthroughout the greater part of his body was scorched and bruised. His\r\nright arm exhibited marks as of having been struck by some heavy body.\r\nHis clothes had been removed, and it was not immediately perceived that\r\nthey were reduced to ashes. His slippers and his hair were untouched.\r\n\r\nHe was removed to his chamber, and the requisite attention paid to his\r\nwounds, which gradually became more painful. A mortification speedily\r\nshewed itself in the arm, which had been most hurt. Soon after, the\r\nother wounded parts exhibited the like appearance.\r\n\r\nImmediately subsequent to this disaster, my father seemed nearly in\r\na state of insensibility. He was passive under every operation. He\r\nscarcely opened his eyes, and was with difficulty prevailed upon to\r\nanswer the questions that were put to him. By his imperfect account, it\r\nappeared, that while engaged in silent orisons, with thoughts full\r\nof confusion and anxiety, a faint gleam suddenly shot athwart the\r\napartment. His fancy immediately pictured to itself, a person bearing\r\na lamp. It seemed to come from behind. He was in the act of turning to\r\nexamine the visitant, when his right arm received a blow from a heavy\r\nclub. At the same instant, a very bright spark was seen to light upon\r\nhis clothes. In a moment, the whole was reduced to ashes. This was the\r\nsum of the information which he chose to give. There was somewhat in\r\nhis manner that indicated an imperfect tale. My uncle was inclined to\r\nbelieve that half the truth had been suppressed.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, the disease thus wonderfully generated, betrayed more\r\nterrible symptoms. Fever and delirium terminated in lethargic slumber,\r\nwhich, in the course of two hours, gave place to death. Yet not till\r\ninsupportable exhalations and crawling putrefaction had driven from his\r\nchamber and the house every one whom their duty did not detain.\r\n\r\nSuch was the end of my father. None surely was ever more mysterious.\r\nWhen we recollect his gloomy anticipations and unconquerable anxiety;\r\nthe security from human malice which his character, the place, and the\r\ncondition of the times, might be supposed to confer; the purity and\r\ncloudlessness of the atmosphere, which rendered it impossible that\r\nlightning was the cause; what are the conclusions that we must form?\r\n\r\nThe prelusive gleam, the blow upon his arm, the fatal spark, the\r\nexplosion heard so far, the fiery cloud that environed him, without\r\ndetriment to the structure, though composed of combustible materials,\r\nthe sudden vanishing of this cloud at my uncle's approach--what is the\r\ninference to be drawn from these facts? Their truth cannot be doubted.\r\nMy uncle's testimony is peculiarly worthy of credit, because no man's\r\ntemper is more sceptical, and his belief is unalterably attached to\r\nnatural causes.\r\n\r\nI was at this time a child of six years of age. The impressions that\r\nwere then made upon me, can never be effaced. I was ill qualified to\r\njudge respecting what was then passing; but as I advanced in age, and\r\nbecame more fully acquainted with these facts, they oftener became the\r\nsubject of my thoughts. Their resemblance to recent events revived them\r\nwith new force in my memory, and made me more anxious to explain them.\r\nWas this the penalty of disobedience? this the stroke of a vindictive\r\nand invisible hand? Is it a fresh proof that the Divine Ruler interferes\r\nin human affairs, meditates an end, selects, and commissions his agents,\r\nand enforces, by unequivocal sanctions, submission to his will? Or, was\r\nit merely the irregular expansion of the fluid that imparts warmth to\r\nour heart and our blood, caused by the fatigue of the preceding day, or\r\nflowing, by established laws, from the condition of his thoughts? [*]\r\n\r\n\r\n     * A case, in its symptoms exactly parallel to this, is\r\n     published in one of the Journals of Florence. See, likewise,\r\n     similar cases reported by Messrs. Merille and Muraire, in\r\n     the \"Journal de Medicine,\" for February and May, 1783. The\r\n     researches of Maffei and Fontana have thrown some light upon\r\n     this subject.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter III\r\n\r\n\r\nThe shock which this disastrous occurrence occasioned to my mother, was\r\nthe foundation of a disease which carried her, in a few months, to the\r\ngrave. My brother and myself were children at this time, and were now\r\nreduced to the condition of orphans. The property which our parents left\r\nwas by no means inconsiderable. It was entrusted to faithful hands,\r\ntill we should arrive at a suitable age. Meanwhile, our education was\r\nassigned to a maiden aunt who resided in the city, and whose tenderness\r\nmade us in a short time cease to regret that we had lost a mother.\r\n\r\nThe years that succeeded were tranquil and happy. Our lives were\r\nmolested by few of those cares that are incident to childhood. By\r\naccident more than design, the indulgence and yielding temper of our\r\naunt was mingled with resolution and stedfastness. She seldom deviated\r\ninto either extreme of rigour or lenity. Our social pleasures were\r\nsubject to no unreasonable restraints. We were instructed in most\r\nbranches of useful knowledge, and were saved from the corruption and\r\ntyranny of colleges and boarding-schools.\r\n\r\nOur companions were chiefly selected from the children of our\r\nneighbours. Between one of these and my brother, there quickly grew the\r\nmost affectionate intimacy. Her name was Catharine Pleyel. She was rich,\r\nbeautiful, and contrived to blend the most bewitching softness with\r\nthe most exuberant vivacity. The tie by which my brother and she were\r\nunited, seemed to add force to the love which I bore her, and which\r\nwas amply returned. Between her and myself there was every circumstance\r\ntending to produce and foster friendship. Our sex and age were the same.\r\nWe lived within sight of each other's abode. Our tempers were remarkably\r\ncongenial, and the superintendants of our education not only prescribed\r\nto us the same pursuits, but allowed us to cultivate them together.\r\n\r\nEvery day added strength to the triple bonds that united us. We\r\ngradually withdrew ourselves from the society of others, and found every\r\nmoment irksome that was not devoted to each other. My brother's advance\r\nin age made no change in our situation. It was determined that his\r\nprofession should be agriculture. His fortune exempted him from the\r\nnecessity of personal labour. The task to be performed by him was\r\nnothing more than superintendance. The skill that was demanded by this\r\nwas merely theoretical, and was furnished by casual inspection, or\r\nby closet study. The attention that was paid to this subject did not\r\nseclude him for any long time from us, on whom time had no other effect\r\nthan to augment our impatience in the absence of each other and of\r\nhim. Our tasks, our walks, our music, were seldom performed but in each\r\nother's company.\r\n\r\nIt was easy to see that Catharine and my brother were born for each\r\nother. The passion which they mutually entertained quickly broke those\r\nbounds which extreme youth had set to it; confessions were made or\r\nextorted, and their union was postponed only till my brother had\r\npassed his minority. The previous lapse of two years was constantly and\r\nusefully employed.\r\n\r\nO my brother! But the task I have set myself let me perform with\r\nsteadiness. The felicity of that period was marred by no gloomy\r\nanticipations. The future, like the present, was serene. Time was\r\nsupposed to have only new delights in store. I mean not to dwell on\r\nprevious incidents longer than is necessary to illustrate or explain\r\nthe great events that have since happened. The nuptial day at length\r\narrived. My brother took possession of the house in which he was born,\r\nand here the long protracted marriage was solemnized.\r\n\r\nMy father's property was equally divided between us. A neat dwelling,\r\nsituated on the bank of the river, three quarters of a mile from my\r\nbrother's, was now occupied by me. These domains were called, from the\r\nname of the first possessor, Mettingen. I can scarcely account for my\r\nrefusing to take up my abode with him, unless it were from a disposition\r\nto be an economist of pleasure. Self-denial, seasonably exercised, is\r\none means of enhancing our gratifications. I was, beside, desirous of\r\nadministering a fund, and regulating an household, of my own. The short\r\ndistance allowed us to exchange visits as often as we pleased. The\r\nwalk from one mansion to the other was no undelightful prelude to our\r\ninterviews. I was sometimes their visitant, and they, as frequently,\r\nwere my guests.\r\n\r\nOur education had been modelled by no religious standard. We were left\r\nto the guidance of our own understanding, and the casual impressions\r\nwhich society might make upon us. My friend's temper, as well as my own,\r\nexempted us from much anxiety on this account. It must not be supposed\r\nthat we were without religion, but with us it was the product of\r\nlively feelings, excited by reflection on our own happiness, and by the\r\ngrandeur of external nature. We sought not a basis for our faith, in\r\nthe weighing of proofs, and the dissection of creeds. Our devotion was\r\na mixed and casual sentiment, seldom verbally expressed, or solicitously\r\nsought, or carefully retained. In the midst of present enjoyment,\r\nno thought was bestowed on the future. As a consolation in calamity\r\nreligion is dear. But calamity was yet at a distance, and its only\r\ntendency was to heighten enjoyments which needed not this addition to\r\nsatisfy every craving.\r\n\r\nMy brother's situation was somewhat different. His deportment was grave,\r\nconsiderate, and thoughtful. I will not say whether he was indebted to\r\nsublimer views for this disposition. Human life, in his opinion, was\r\nmade up of changeable elements, and the principles of duty were not\r\neasily unfolded. The future, either as anterior, or subsequent to death,\r\nwas a scene that required some preparation and provision to be made for\r\nit. These positions we could not deny, but what distinguished him was a\r\npropensity to ruminate on these truths. The images that visited us were\r\nblithsome and gay, but those with which he was most familiar were of\r\nan opposite hue. They did not generate affliction and fear, but they\r\ndiffused over his behaviour a certain air of forethought and sobriety.\r\nThe principal effect of this temper was visible in his features and\r\ntones. These, in general, bespoke a sort of thrilling melancholy. I\r\nscarcely ever knew him to laugh. He never accompanied the lawless mirth\r\nof his companions with more than a smile, but his conduct was the same\r\nas ours.\r\n\r\nHe partook of our occupations and amusements with a zeal not less than\r\nours, but of a different kind. The diversity in our temper was never\r\nthe parent of discord, and was scarcely a topic of regret. The scene\r\nwas variegated, but not tarnished or disordered by it. It hindered the\r\nelement in which we moved from stagnating. Some agitation and concussion\r\nis requisite to the due exercise of human understanding. In his studies,\r\nhe pursued an austerer and more arduous path. He was much conversant\r\nwith the history of religious opinions, and took pains to ascertain\r\ntheir validity. He deemed it indispensable to examine the ground of\r\nhis belief, to settle the relation between motives and actions, the\r\ncriterion of merit, and the kinds and properties of evidence.\r\n\r\nThere was an obvious resemblance between him and my father, in their\r\nconceptions of the importance of certain topics, and in the light in\r\nwhich the vicissitudes of human life were accustomed to be viewed.\r\nTheir characters were similar, but the mind of the son was enriched by\r\nscience, and embellished with literature.\r\n\r\nThe temple was no longer assigned to its ancient use. From an Italian\r\nadventurer, who erroneously imagined that he could find employment\r\nfor his skill, and sale for his sculptures in America, my brother had\r\npurchased a bust of Cicero. He professed to have copied this piece from\r\nan antique dug up with his own hands in the environs of Modena. Of the\r\ntruth of his assertions we were not qualified to judge; but the marble\r\nwas pure and polished, and we were contented to admire the performance,\r\nwithout waiting for the sanction of connoisseurs. We hired the same\r\nartist to hew a suitable pedestal from a neighbouring quarry. This was\r\nplaced in the temple, and the bust rested upon it. Opposite to this was\r\na harpsichord, sheltered by a temporary roof from the weather. This was\r\nthe place of resort in the evenings of summer. Here we sung, and talked,\r\nand read, and occasionally banqueted. Every joyous and tender scene most\r\ndear to my memory, is connected with this edifice. Here the performances\r\nof our musical and poetical ancestor were rehearsed. Here my brother's\r\nchildren received the rudiments of their education; here a thousand\r\nconversations, pregnant with delight and improvement, took place; and\r\nhere the social affections were accustomed to expand, and the tear of\r\ndelicious sympathy to be shed.\r\n\r\nMy brother was an indefatigable student. The authors whom he read were\r\nnumerous, but the chief object of his veneration was Cicero. He was\r\nnever tired of conning and rehearsing his productions. To understand\r\nthem was not sufficient. He was anxious to discover the gestures and\r\ncadences with which they ought to be delivered. He was very scrupulous\r\nin selecting a true scheme of pronunciation for the Latin tongue, and in\r\nadapting it to the words of his darling writer. His favorite occupation\r\nconsisted in embellishing his rhetoric with all the proprieties of\r\ngesticulation and utterance.\r\n\r\nNot contented with this, he was diligent in settling and restoring the\r\npurity of the text. For this end, he collected all the editions and\r\ncommentaries that could be procured, and employed months of severe study\r\nin exploring and comparing them. He never betrayed more satisfaction\r\nthan when he made a discovery of this kind.\r\n\r\nIt was not till the addition of Henry Pleyel, my friend's only brother,\r\nto our society, that his passion for Roman eloquence was countenanced\r\nand fostered by a sympathy of tastes. This young man had been some years\r\nin Europe. We had separated at a very early age, and he was now returned\r\nto spend the remainder of his days among us.\r\n\r\nOur circle was greatly enlivened by the accession of a new member. His\r\nconversation abounded with novelty. His gaiety was almost boisterous,\r\nbut was capable of yielding to a grave deportment when the occasion\r\nrequired it. His discernment was acute, but he was prone to view every\r\nobject merely as supplying materials for mirth. His conceptions\r\nwere ardent but ludicrous, and his memory, aided, as he honestly\r\nacknowledged, by his invention, was an inexhaustible fund of\r\nentertainment.\r\n\r\nHis residence was at the same distance below the city as ours was above,\r\nbut there seldom passed a day without our being favoured with a visit.\r\nMy brother and he were endowed with the same attachment to the Latin\r\nwriters; and Pleyel was not behind his friend in his knowledge of the\r\nhistory and metaphysics of religion. Their creeds, however, were in many\r\nrespects opposite. Where one discovered only confirmations of his faith,\r\nthe other could find nothing but reasons for doubt. Moral necessity,\r\nand calvinistic inspiration, were the props on which my brother thought\r\nproper to repose. Pleyel was the champion of intellectual liberty, and\r\nrejected all guidance but that of his reason. Their discussions were\r\nfrequent, but, being managed with candour as well as with skill, they\r\nwere always listened to by us with avidity and benefit.\r\n\r\nPleyel, like his new friends, was fond of music and poetry. Henceforth\r\nour concerts consisted of two violins, an harpsichord, and three voices.\r\nWe were frequently reminded how much happiness depends upon society.\r\nThis new friend, though, before his arrival, we were sensible of no\r\nvacuity, could not now be spared. His departure would occasion a void\r\nwhich nothing could fill, and which would produce insupportable regret.\r\nEven my brother, though his opinions were hourly assailed, and even the\r\ndivinity of Cicero contested, was captivated with his friend, and laid\r\naside some part of his ancient gravity at Pleyel's approach.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter IV\r\n\r\n\r\nSix years of uninterrupted happiness had rolled away, since my brother's\r\nmarriage. The sound of war had been heard, but it was at such a distance\r\nas to enhance our enjoyment by affording objects of comparison. The\r\nIndians were repulsed on the one side, and Canada was conquered on the\r\nother. Revolutions and battles, however calamitous to those who occupied\r\nthe scene, contributed in some sort to our happiness, by agitating our\r\nminds with curiosity, and furnishing causes of patriotic exultation.\r\nFour children, three of whom were of an age to compensate, by their\r\npersonal and mental progress, the cares of which they had been, at a\r\nmore helpless age, the objects, exercised my brother's tenderness. The\r\nfourth was a charming babe that promised to display the image of her\r\nmother, and enjoyed perfect health. To these were added a sweet girl\r\nfourteen years old, who was loved by all of us, with an affection more\r\nthan parental.\r\n\r\nHer mother's story was a mournful one. She had come hither from England\r\nwhen this child was an infant, alone, without friends, and without\r\nmoney. She appeared to have embarked in a hasty and clandestine\r\nmanner. She passed three years of solitude and anguish under my aunt's\r\nprotection, and died a martyr to woe; the source of which she could, by\r\nno importunities, be prevailed upon to unfold. Her education and manners\r\nbespoke her to be of no mean birth. Her last moments were rendered\r\nserene, by the assurances she received from my aunt, that her daughter\r\nshould experience the same protection that had been extended to herself.\r\n\r\nOn my brother's marriage, it was agreed that she should make a part of\r\nhis family. I cannot do justice to the attractions of this girl. Perhaps\r\nthe tenderness she excited might partly originate in her personal\r\nresemblance to her mother, whose character and misfortunes were\r\nstill fresh in our remembrance. She was habitually pensive, and this\r\ncircumstance tended to remind the spectator of her friendless condition;\r\nand yet that epithet was surely misapplied in this case. This being was\r\ncherished by those with whom she now resided, with unspeakable fondness.\r\nEvery exertion was made to enlarge and improve her mind. Her safety\r\nwas the object of a solicitude that almost exceeded the bounds of\r\ndiscretion. Our affection indeed could scarcely transcend her merits.\r\nShe never met my eye, or occurred to my reflections, without exciting\r\na kind of enthusiasm. Her softness, her intelligence, her equanimity,\r\nnever shall I see surpassed. I have often shed tears of pleasure at her\r\napproach, and pressed her to my bosom in an agony of fondness.\r\n\r\nWhile every day was adding to the charms of her person, and the stores\r\nof her mind, there occurred an event which threatened to deprive us\r\nof her. An officer of some rank, who had been disabled by a wound\r\nat Quebec, had employed himself, since the ratification of peace, in\r\ntravelling through the colonies. He remained a considerable period at\r\nPhiladelphia, but was at last preparing for his departure. No one had\r\nbeen more frequently honoured with his visits than Mrs. Baynton, a\r\nworthy lady with whom our family were intimate. He went to her house\r\nwith a view to perform a farewell visit, and was on the point of taking\r\nhis leave, when I and my young friend entered the apartment. It is\r\nimpossible to describe the emotions of the stranger, when he fixed his\r\neyes upon my companion. He was motionless with surprise. He was unable\r\nto conceal his feelings, but sat silently gazing at the spectacle before\r\nhim. At length he turned to Mrs. Baynton, and more by his looks and\r\ngestures than by words, besought her for an explanation of the scene.\r\nHe seized the hand of the girl, who, in her turn, was surprised by his\r\nbehaviour, and drawing her forward, said in an eager and faultering\r\ntone, Who is she? whence does she come? what is her name?\r\n\r\nThe answers that were given only increased the confusion of his\r\nthoughts. He was successively told, that she was the daughter of one\r\nwhose name was Louisa Conway, who arrived among us at such a time, who\r\nsedulously concealed her parentage, and the motives of her flight, whose\r\nincurable griefs had finally destroyed her, and who had left this child\r\nunder the protection of her friends. Having heard the tale, he melted\r\ninto tears, eagerly clasped the young lady in his arms, and called\r\nhimself her father. When the tumults excited in his breast by this\r\nunlooked-for meeting were somewhat subsided, he gratified our curiosity\r\nby relating the following incidents.\r\n\r\n\"Miss Conway was the only daughter of a banker in London, who discharged\r\ntowards her every duty of an affectionate father. He had chanced to fall\r\ninto her company, had been subdued by her attractions, had tendered her\r\nhis hand, and been joyfully accepted both by parent and child. His wife\r\nhad given him every proof of the fondest attachment. Her father, who\r\npossessed immense wealth, treated him with distinguished respect,\r\nliberally supplied his wants, and had made one condition of his consent\r\nto their union, a resolution to take up their abode with him.\r\n\r\n\"They had passed three years of conjugal felicity, which had been\r\naugmented by the birth of this child; when his professional duty called\r\nhim into Germany. It was not without an arduous struggle, that she was\r\npersuaded to relinquish the design of accompanying him through all the\r\ntoils and perils of war. No parting was ever more distressful. They\r\nstrove to alleviate, by frequent letters, the evils of their lot. Those\r\nof his wife, breathed nothing but anxiety for his safety, and impatience\r\nof his absence. At length, a new arrangement was made, and he was\r\nobliged to repair from Westphalia to Canada. One advantage attended this\r\nchange. It afforded him an opportunity of meeting his family. His\r\nwife anticipated this interview, with no less rapture than himself. He\r\nhurried to London, and the moment he alighted from the stage-coach, ran\r\nwith all speed to Mr. Conway's house.\r\n\r\n\"It was an house of mourning. His father was overwhelmed with grief, and\r\nincapable of answering his inquiries. The servants, sorrowful and mute,\r\nwere equally refractory. He explored the house, and called on the names\r\nof his wife and daughter, but his summons was fruitless. At length,\r\nthis new disaster was explained. Two days before his arrival, his wife's\r\nchamber was found empty. No search, however diligent and anxious, could\r\ntrace her steps. No cause could be assigned for her disappearance. The\r\nmother and child had fled away together.\r\n\r\n\"New exertions were made, her chamber and cabinets were ransacked, but\r\nno vestige was found serving to inform them as to the motives of her\r\nflight, whether it had been voluntary or otherwise, and in what corner\r\nof the kingdom or of the world she was concealed. Who shall describe the\r\nsorrow and amazement of the husband? His restlessness, his vicissitudes\r\nof hope and fear, and his ultimate despair? His duty called him to\r\nAmerica. He had been in this city, and had frequently passed the door of\r\nthe house in which his wife, at that moment, resided. Her father had not\r\nremitted his exertions to elucidate this painful mystery, but they had\r\nfailed. This disappointment hastened his death; in consequence of which,\r\nLouisa's father became possessor of his immense property.\"\r\n\r\nThis tale was a copious theme of speculation. A thousand questions were\r\nstarted and discussed in our domestic circle, respecting the motives\r\nthat influenced Mrs. Stuart to abandon her country. It did not appear\r\nthat her proceeding was involuntary. We recalled and reviewed every\r\nparticular that had fallen under our own observation. By none of these\r\nwere we furnished with a clue. Her conduct, after the most rigorous\r\nscrutiny, still remained an impenetrable secret. On a nearer view, Major\r\nStuart proved himself a man of most amiable character. His attachment\r\nto Louisa appeared hourly to increase. She was no stranger to the\r\nsentiments suitable to her new character. She could not but readily\r\nembrace the scheme which was proposed to her, to return with her father\r\nto England. This scheme his regard for her induced him, however, to\r\npostpone. Some time was necessary to prepare her for so great a change\r\nand enable her to think without agony of her separation from us.\r\n\r\nI was not without hopes of prevailing on her father entirely to\r\nrelinquish this unwelcome design. Meanwhile, he pursued his travels\r\nthrough the southern colonies, and his daughter continued with us.\r\nLouisa and my brother frequently received letters from him, which\r\nindicated a mind of no common order. They were filled with amusing\r\ndetails, and profound reflections. While here, he often partook of\r\nour evening conversations at the temple; and since his departure, his\r\ncorrespondence had frequently supplied us with topics of discourse.\r\n\r\nOne afternoon in May, the blandness of the air, and brightness of the\r\nverdure, induced us to assemble, earlier than usual, in the temple.\r\nWe females were busy at the needle, while my brother and Pleyel were\r\nbandying quotations and syllogisms. The point discussed was the merit of\r\nthe oration for Cluentius, as descriptive, first, of the genius of the\r\nspeaker; and, secondly, of the manners of the times. Pleyel laboured to\r\nextenuate both these species of merit, and tasked his ingenuity, to shew\r\nthat the orator had embraced a bad cause; or, at least, a doubtful one.\r\nHe urged, that to rely on the exaggerations of an advocate, or to\r\nmake the picture of a single family a model from which to sketch the\r\ncondition of a nation, was absurd. The controversy was suddenly diverted\r\ninto a new channel, by a misquotation. Pleyel accused his companion of\r\nsaying \"polliciatur\" when he should have said \"polliceretur.\" Nothing\r\nwould decide the contest, but an appeal to the volume. My brother was\r\nreturning to the house for this purpose, when a servant met him with\r\na letter from Major Stuart. He immediately returned to read it in our\r\ncompany.\r\n\r\nBesides affectionate compliments to us, and paternal benedictions\r\non Louisa, his letter contained a description of a waterfall on the\r\nMonongahela. A sudden gust of rain falling, we were compelled to remove\r\nto the house. The storm passed away, and a radiant moon-light succeeded.\r\nThere was no motion to resume our seats in the temple. We therefore\r\nremained where we were, and engaged in sprightly conversation. The\r\nletter lately received naturally suggested the topic. A parallel was\r\ndrawn between the cataract there described, and one which Pleyel had\r\ndiscovered among the Alps of Glarus. In the state of the former, some\r\nparticular was mentioned, the truth of which was questionable. To settle\r\nthe dispute which thence arose, it was proposed to have recourse to the\r\nletter. My brother searched for it in his pocket. It was no where to be\r\nfound. At length, he remembered to have left it in the temple, and he\r\ndetermined to go in search of it. His wife, Pleyel, Louisa, and myself,\r\nremained where we were.\r\n\r\nIn a few minutes he returned. I was somewhat interested in the dispute,\r\nand was therefore impatient for his return; yet, as I heard him\r\nascending the stairs, I could not but remark, that he had executed his\r\nintention with remarkable dispatch. My eyes were fixed upon him on his\r\nentrance. Methought he brought with him looks considerably different\r\nfrom those with which he departed. Wonder, and a slight portion of\r\nanxiety were mingled in them. His eyes seemed to be in search of some\r\nobject. They passed quickly from one person to another, till they rested\r\non his wife. She was seated in a careless attitude on the sofa, in the\r\nsame spot as before. She had the same muslin in her hand, by which her\r\nattention was chiefly engrossed.\r\n\r\nThe moment he saw her, his perplexity visibly increased. He quietly\r\nseated himself, and fixing his eyes on the floor, appeared to be\r\nabsorbed in meditation. These singularities suspended the inquiry which\r\nI was preparing to make respecting the letter. In a short time, the\r\ncompany relinquished the subject which engaged them, and directed their\r\nattention to Wieland. They thought that he only waited for a pause in\r\nthe discourse, to produce the letter. The pause was uninterrupted by\r\nhim. At length Pleyel said, \"Well, I suppose you have found the letter.\"\r\n\r\n\"No,\" said he, without any abatement of his gravity, and looking\r\nstedfastly at his wife, \"I did not mount the hill.\"--\"Why\r\nnot?\"--\"Catharine, have you not moved from that spot since I left the\r\nroom?\"--She was affected with the solemnity of his manner, and laying\r\ndown her work, answered in a tone of surprise, \"No; Why do you ask that\r\nquestion?\"--His eyes were again fixed upon the floor, and he did not\r\nimmediately answer. At length, he said, looking round upon us, \"Is it\r\ntrue that Catharine did not follow me to the hill? That she did not just\r\nnow enter the room?\"--We assured him, with one voice, that she had not\r\nbeen absent for a moment, and inquired into the motive of his questions.\r\n\r\n\"Your assurances,\" said he, \"are solemn and unanimous; and yet I must\r\ndeny credit to your assertions, or disbelieve the testimony of my\r\nsenses, which informed me, when I was half way up the hill, that\r\nCatharine was at the bottom.\"\r\n\r\nWe were confounded at this declaration. Pleyel rallied him with great\r\nlevity on his behaviour. He listened to his friend with calmness, but\r\nwithout any relaxation of features.\r\n\r\n\"One thing,\" said he with emphasis, \"is true; either I heard my\r\nwife's voice at the bottom of the hill, or I do not hear your voice at\r\npresent.\"\r\n\r\n\"Truly,\" returned Pleyel, \"it is a sad dilemma to which you have reduced\r\nyourself. Certain it is, if our eyes can give us certainty that your\r\nwife has been sitting in that spot during every moment of your absence.\r\nYou have heard her voice, you say, upon the hill. In general, her voice,\r\nlike her temper, is all softness. To be heard across the room, she is\r\nobliged to exert herself. While you were gone, if I mistake not, she did\r\nnot utter a word. Clara and I had all the talk to ourselves. Still it\r\nmay be that she held a whispering conference with you on the hill; but\r\ntell us the particulars.\"\r\n\r\n\"The conference,\" said he, \"was short; and far from being carried on in\r\na whisper. You know with what intention I left the house. Half way to\r\nthe rock, the moon was for a moment hidden from us by a cloud. I never\r\nknew the air to be more bland and more calm. In this interval I glanced\r\nat the temple, and thought I saw a glimmering between the columns. It\r\nwas so faint, that it would not perhaps have been visible, if the moon\r\nhad not been shrowded. I looked again, but saw nothing. I never visit\r\nthis building alone, or at night, without being reminded of the fate\r\nof my father. There was nothing wonderful in this appearance; yet it\r\nsuggested something more than mere solitude and darkness in the same\r\nplace would have done.\r\n\r\n\"I kept on my way. The images that haunted me were solemn; and I\r\nentertained an imperfect curiosity, but no fear, as to the nature of\r\nthis object. I had ascended the hill little more than half way, when a\r\nvoice called me from behind. The accents were clear, distinct, powerful,\r\nand were uttered, as I fully believed, by my wife. Her voice is\r\nnot commonly so loud. She has seldom occasion to exert it, but,\r\nnevertheless, I have sometimes heard her call with force and eagerness.\r\nIf my ear was not deceived, it was her voice which I heard.\r\n\r\n\"Stop, go no further. There is danger in your path.\" The suddenness\r\nand unexpectedness of this warning, the tone of alarm with which it was\r\ngiven, and, above all, the persuasion that it was my wife who spoke,\r\nwere enough to disconcert and make me pause. I turned and listened to\r\nassure myself that I was not mistaken. The deepest silence succeeded. At\r\nlength, I spoke in my turn. Who calls? is it you, Catharine? I stopped\r\nand presently received an answer. \"Yes, it is I; go not up; return\r\ninstantly; you are wanted at the house.\" Still the voice was\r\nCatharine's, and still it proceeded from the foot of the stairs.\r\n\r\n\"What could I do? The warning was mysterious. To be uttered by Catharine\r\nat a place, and on an occasion like these, enhanced the mystery. I could\r\ndo nothing but obey. Accordingly, I trod back my steps, expecting that\r\nshe waited for me at the bottom of the hill. When I reached the\r\nbottom, no one was visible. The moon-light was once more universal and\r\nbrilliant, and yet, as far as I could see no human or moving figure\r\nwas discernible. If she had returned to the house, she must have used\r\nwondrous expedition to have passed already beyond the reach of my eye.\r\nI exerted my voice, but in vain. To my repeated exclamations, no answer\r\nwas returned.\r\n\r\n\"Ruminating on these incidents, I returned hither. There was no room\r\nto doubt that I had heard my wife's voice; attending incidents were not\r\neasily explained; but you now assure me that nothing extraordinary has\r\nhappened to urge my return, and that my wife has not moved from her\r\nseat.\"\r\n\r\nSuch was my brother's narrative. It was heard by us with different\r\nemotions. Pleyel did not scruple to regard the whole as a deception of\r\nthe senses. Perhaps a voice had been heard; but Wieland's imagination\r\nhad misled him in supposing a resemblance to that of his wife, and\r\ngiving such a signification to the sounds. According to his custom\r\nhe spoke what he thought. Sometimes, he made it the theme of grave\r\ndiscussion, but more frequently treated it with ridicule. He did not\r\nbelieve that sober reasoning would convince his friend, and gaiety, he\r\nthought, was useful to take away the solemnities which, in a mind like\r\nWieland's, an accident of this kind was calculated to produce.\r\n\r\nPleyel proposed to go in search of the letter. He went and speedily\r\nreturned, bearing it in his hand. He had found it open on the pedestal;\r\nand neither voice nor visage had risen to impede his design.\r\n\r\nCatharine was endowed with an uncommon portion of good sense; but her\r\nmind was accessible, on this quarter, to wonder and panic. That her\r\nvoice should be thus inexplicably and unwarrantably assumed, was a\r\nsource of no small disquietude. She admitted the plausibility of the\r\narguments by which Pleyel endeavoured to prove, that this was no more\r\nthan an auricular deception; but this conviction was sure to be shaken,\r\nwhen she turned her eyes upon her husband, and perceived that Pleyel's\r\nlogic was far from having produced the same effect upon him.\r\n\r\nAs to myself, my attention was engaged by this occurrence. I could not\r\nfail to perceive a shadowy resemblance between it and my father's death.\r\nOn the latter event, I had frequently reflected; my reflections never\r\nconducted me to certainty, but the doubts that existed were not of a\r\ntormenting kind. I could not deny that the event was miraculous, and\r\nyet I was invincibly averse to that method of solution. My wonder was\r\nexcited by the inscrutableness of the cause, but my wonder was unmixed\r\nwith sorrow or fear. It begat in me a thrilling, and not unpleasing\r\nsolemnity. Similar to these were the sensations produced by the recent\r\nadventure.\r\n\r\nBut its effect upon my brother's imagination was of chief moment.\r\nAll that was desirable was, that it should be regarded by him with\r\nindifference. The worst effect that could flow, was not indeed very\r\nformidable. Yet I could not bear to think that his senses should be the\r\nvictims of such delusion. It argued a diseased condition of his frame,\r\nwhich might show itself hereafter in more dangerous symptoms. The will\r\nis the tool of the understanding, which must fashion its conclusions\r\non the notices of sense. If the senses be depraved, it is impossible to\r\ncalculate the evils that may flow from the consequent deductions of the\r\nunderstanding.\r\n\r\nI said, this man is of an ardent and melancholy character. Those ideas\r\nwhich, in others, are casual or obscure, which are entertained in\r\nmoments of abstraction and solitude, and easily escape when the scene is\r\nchanged, have obtained an immoveable hold upon his mind. The conclusions\r\nwhich long habit has rendered familiar, and, in some sort, palpable to\r\nhis intellect, are drawn from the deepest sources. All his actions and\r\npractical sentiments are linked with long and abstruse deductions\r\nfrom the system of divine government and the laws of our intellectual\r\nconstitution. He is, in some respects, an enthusiast, but is fortified\r\nin his belief by innumerable arguments and subtilties.\r\n\r\nHis father's death was always regarded by him as flowing from a direct\r\nand supernatural decree. It visited his meditations oftener than it did\r\nmine. The traces which it left were more gloomy and permanent. This new\r\nincident had a visible effect in augmenting his gravity. He was less\r\ndisposed than formerly to converse and reading. When we sifted his\r\nthoughts, they were generally found to have a relation, more or less\r\ndirect, with this incident. It was difficult to ascertain the exact\r\nspecies of impression which it made upon him. He never introduced the\r\nsubject into conversation, and listened with a silent and half-serious\r\nsmile to the satirical effusions of Pleyel.\r\n\r\nOne evening we chanced to be alone together in the temple. I seized that\r\nopportunity of investigating the state of his thoughts. After a pause,\r\nwhich he seemed in no wise inclined to interrupt, I spoke to him--\"How\r\nalmost palpable is this dark; yet a ray from above would dispel it.\"\r\n\"Ay,\" said Wieland, with fervor, \"not only the physical, but moral night\r\nwould be dispelled.\" \"But why,\" said I, \"must the Divine Will address\r\nits precepts to the eye?\" He smiled significantly. \"True,\" said he, \"the\r\nunderstanding has other avenues.\" \"You have never,\" said I, approaching\r\nnearer to the point--\"you have never told me in what way you considered\r\nthe late extraordinary incident.\" \"There is no determinate way in which\r\nthe subject can be viewed. Here is an effect, but the cause is utterly\r\ninscrutable. To suppose a deception will not do. Such is possible, but\r\nthere are twenty other suppositions more probable. They must all be set\r\naside before we reach that point.\" \"What are these twenty suppositions?\"\r\n\"It is needless to mention them. They are only less improbable than\r\nPleyel's. Time may convert one of them into certainty. Till then it is\r\nuseless to expatiate on them.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter V\r\n\r\n\r\nSome time had elapsed when there happened another occurrence, still more\r\nremarkable. Pleyel, on his return from Europe, brought information of\r\nconsiderable importance to my brother. My ancestors were noble Saxons,\r\nand possessed large domains in Lusatia. The Prussian wars had destroyed\r\nthose persons whose right to these estates precluded my brother's.\r\nPleyel had been exact in his inquiries, and had discovered that, by the\r\nlaw of male-primogeniture, my brother's claims were superior to those\r\nof any other person now living. Nothing was wanting but his presence in\r\nthat country, and a legal application to establish this claim.\r\n\r\nPleyel strenuously recommended this measure. The advantages he thought\r\nattending it were numerous, and it would argue the utmost folly to\r\nneglect them. Contrary to his expectation he found my brother averse\r\nto the scheme. Slight efforts, he, at first, thought would subdue his\r\nreluctance; but he found this aversion by no means slight. The interest\r\nthat he took in the happiness of his friend and his sister, and his own\r\npartiality to the Saxon soil, from which he had likewise sprung, and\r\nwhere he had spent several years of his youth, made him redouble his\r\nexertions to win Wieland's consent. For this end he employed every\r\nargument that his invention could suggest. He painted, in attractive\r\ncolours, the state of manners and government in that country, the\r\nsecurity of civil rights, and the freedom of religious sentiments. He\r\ndwelt on the privileges of wealth and rank, and drew from the servile\r\ncondition of one class, an argument in favor of his scheme, since the\r\nrevenue and power annexed to a German principality afford so large a\r\nfield for benevolence. The evil flowing from this power, in malignant\r\nhands, was proportioned to the good that would arise from the virtuous\r\nuse of it. Hence, Wieland, in forbearing to claim his own, withheld all\r\nthe positive felicity that would accrue to his vassals from his success,\r\nand hazarded all the misery that would redound from a less enlightened\r\nproprietor.\r\n\r\nIt was easy for my brother to repel these arguments, and to shew that no\r\nspot on the globe enjoyed equal security and liberty to that which he\r\nat present inhabited. That if the Saxons had nothing to fear from\r\nmis-government, the external causes of havoc and alarm were numerous and\r\nmanifest. The recent devastations committed by the Prussians furnished\r\na specimen of these. The horrors of war would always impend over them,\r\ntill Germany were seized and divided by Austrian and Prussian tyrants;\r\nan event which he strongly suspected was at no great distance. But\r\nsetting these considerations aside, was it laudable to grasp at wealth\r\nand power even when they were within our reach? Were not these the two\r\ngreat sources of depravity? What security had he, that in this change\r\nof place and condition, he should not degenerate into a tyrant and\r\nvoluptuary? Power and riches were chiefly to be dreaded on account of\r\ntheir tendency to deprave the possessor. He held them in abhorrence, not\r\nonly as instruments of misery to others, but to him on whom they\r\nwere conferred. Besides, riches were comparative, and was he not rich\r\nalready? He lived at present in the bosom of security and luxury. All\r\nthe instruments of pleasure, on which his reason or imagination set any\r\nvalue, were within his reach. But these he must forego, for the sake of\r\nadvantages which, whatever were their value, were as yet uncertain. In\r\npursuit of an imaginary addition to his wealth, he must reduce himself\r\nto poverty, he must exchange present certainties for what was distant\r\nand contingent; for who knows not that the law is a system of expence,\r\ndelay and uncertainty? If he should embrace this scheme, it would lay\r\nhim under the necessity of making a voyage to Europe, and remaining for\r\na certain period, separate from his family. He must undergo the perils\r\nand discomforts of the ocean; he must divest himself of all domestic\r\npleasures; he must deprive his wife of her companion, and his children\r\nof a father and instructor, and all for what? For the ambiguous\r\nadvantages which overgrown wealth and flagitious tyranny have to bestow?\r\nFor a precarious possession in a land of turbulence and war? Advantages,\r\nwhich will not certainly be gained, and of which the acquisition, if it\r\nwere sure, is necessarily distant.\r\n\r\nPleyel was enamoured of his scheme on account of its intrinsic benefits,\r\nbut, likewise, for other reasons. His abode at Leipsig made that country\r\nappear to him like home. He was connected with this place by many social\r\nties. While there he had not escaped the amorous contagion. But the\r\nlady, though her heart was impressed in his favor, was compelled to\r\nbestow her hand upon another. Death had removed this impediment, and\r\nhe was now invited by the lady herself to return. This he was of course\r\ndetermined to do, but was anxious to obtain the company of Wieland;\r\nhe could not bear to think of an eternal separation from his present\r\nassociates. Their interest, he thought, would be no less promoted by the\r\nchange than his own. Hence he was importunate and indefatigable in his\r\narguments and solicitations.\r\n\r\nHe knew that he could not hope for mine or his sister's ready\r\nconcurrence in this scheme. Should the subject be mentioned to us, we\r\nshould league our efforts against him, and strengthen that reluctance\r\nin Wieland which already was sufficiently difficult to conquer. He,\r\ntherefore, anxiously concealed from us his purpose. If Wieland were\r\npreviously enlisted in his cause, he would find it a less difficult task\r\nto overcome our aversion. My brother was silent on this subject, because\r\nhe believed himself in no danger of changing his opinion, and he was\r\nwilling to save us from any uneasiness. The mere mention of such\r\na scheme, and the possibility of his embracing it, he knew, would\r\nconsiderably impair our tranquillity.\r\n\r\nOne day, about three weeks subsequent to the mysterious call, it was\r\nagreed that the family should be my guests. Seldom had a day been passed\r\nby us, of more serene enjoyment. Pleyel had promised us his company, but\r\nwe did not see him till the sun had nearly declined. He brought with\r\nhim a countenance that betokened disappointment and vexation. He did not\r\nwait for our inquiries, but immediately explained the cause. Two days\r\nbefore a packet had arrived from Hamburgh, by which he had flattered\r\nhimself with the expectation of receiving letters, but no letters had\r\narrived. I never saw him so much subdued by an untoward event. His\r\nthoughts were employed in accounting for the silence of his friends.\r\nHe was seized with the torments of jealousy, and suspected nothing less\r\nthan the infidelity of her to whom he had devoted his heart. The silence\r\nmust have been concerted. Her sickness, or absence, or death, would have\r\nincreased the certainty of some one's having written. No supposition\r\ncould be formed but that his mistress had grown indifferent, or that she\r\nhad transferred her affections to another. The miscarriage of a letter\r\nwas hardly within the reach of possibility. From Leipsig to Hamburgh,\r\nand from Hamburgh hither, the conveyance was exposed to no hazard.\r\n\r\nHe had been so long detained in America chiefly in consequence of\r\nWieland's aversion to the scheme which he proposed. He now became more\r\nimpatient than ever to return to Europe. When he reflected that, by his\r\ndelays, he had probably forfeited the affections of his mistress, his\r\nsensations amounted to agony. It only remained, by his speedy departure,\r\nto repair, if possible, or prevent so intolerable an evil. Already he\r\nhad half resolved to embark in this very ship which, he was informed,\r\nwould set out in a few weeks on her return.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile he determined to make a new attempt to shake the resolution of\r\nWieland. The evening was somewhat advanced when he invited the latter\r\nto walk abroad with him. The invitation was accepted, and they left\r\nCatharine, Louisa and me, to amuse ourselves by the best means in our\r\npower. During this walk, Pleyel renewed the subject that was nearest\r\nhis heart. He re-urged all his former arguments, and placed them in more\r\nforcible lights.\r\n\r\nThey promised to return shortly; but hour after hour passed, and they\r\nmade not their appearance. Engaged in sprightly conversation, it was not\r\ntill the clock struck twelve that we were reminded of the lapse of time.\r\nThe absence of our friends excited some uneasy apprehensions. We were\r\nexpressing our fears, and comparing our conjectures as to what might be\r\nthe cause, when they entered together. There were indications in their\r\ncountenances that struck me mute. These were unnoticed by Catharine, who\r\nwas eager to express her surprize and curiosity at the length of their\r\nwalk. As they listened to her, I remarked that their surprize was not\r\nless than ours. They gazed in silence on each other, and on her. I\r\nwatched their looks, but could not understand the emotions that were\r\nwritten in them.\r\n\r\nThese appearances diverted Catharine's inquiries into a new channel.\r\nWhat did they mean, she asked, by their silence, and by their thus\r\ngazing wildly at each other, and at her? Pleyel profited by this hint,\r\nand assuming an air of indifference, framed some trifling excuse, at the\r\nsame time darting significant glances at Wieland, as if to caution him\r\nagainst disclosing the truth. My brother said nothing, but delivered\r\nhimself up to meditation. I likewise was silent, but burned with\r\nimpatience to fathom this mystery. Presently my brother and his wife,\r\nand Louisa, returned home. Pleyel proposed, of his own accord, to be\r\nmy guest for the night. This circumstance, in addition to those which\r\npreceded, gave new edge to my wonder.\r\n\r\nAs soon as we were left alone, Pleyel's countenance assumed an air of\r\nseriousness, and even consternation, which I had never before beheld in\r\nhim. The steps with which he measured the floor betokened the trouble of\r\nhis thoughts. My inquiries were suspended by the hope that he would give\r\nme the information that I wanted without the importunity of questions.\r\nI waited some time, but the confusion of his thoughts appeared in no\r\ndegree to abate. At length I mentioned the apprehensions which their\r\nunusual absence had occasioned, and which were increased by their\r\nbehaviour since their return, and solicited an explanation. He stopped\r\nwhen I began to speak, and looked stedfastly at me. When I had done,\r\nhe said, to me, in a tone which faultered through the vehemence of his\r\nemotions, \"How were you employed during our absence?\" \"In turning over\r\nthe Della Crusca dictionary, and talking on different subjects; but\r\njust before your entrance, we were tormenting ourselves with omens and\r\nprognosticks relative to your absence.\" \"Catherine was with you the\r\nwhole time?\" \"Yes.\" \"But are you sure?\" \"Most sure. She was not absent a\r\nmoment.\" He stood, for a time, as if to assure himself of my sincerity.\r\nThen, clinching his hands, and wildly lifting them above his head, \"Lo,\"\r\ncried he, \"I have news to tell you. The Baroness de Stolberg is dead?\"\r\n\r\nThis was her whom he loved. I was not surprised at the agitations which\r\nhe betrayed. \"But how was the information procured? How was the truth\r\nof this news connected with the circumstance of Catharine's remaining in\r\nour company?\" He was for some time inattentive to my questions. When he\r\nspoke, it seemed merely a continuation of the reverie into which he had\r\nbeen plunged.\r\n\r\n\"And yet it might be a mere deception. But could both of us in that\r\ncase have been deceived? A rare and prodigious coincidence! Barely not\r\nimpossible. And yet, if the accent be oracular--Theresa is dead. No,\r\nno,\" continued he, covering his face with his hands, and in a tone half\r\nbroken into sobs, \"I cannot believe it. She has not written, but if\r\nshe were dead, the faithful Bertrand would have given me the earliest\r\ninformation. And yet if he knew his master, he must have easily guessed\r\nat the effect of such tidings. In pity to me he was silent.\"\r\n\r\n\"Clara, forgive me; to you, this behaviour is mysterious. I will explain\r\nas well as I am able. But say not a word to Catharine. Her strength of\r\nmind is inferior to your's. She will, besides, have more reason to be\r\nstartled. She is Wieland's angel.\"\r\n\r\nPleyel proceeded to inform me, for the first time, of the scheme which\r\nhe had pressed, with so much earnestness, on my brother. He enumerated\r\nthe objections which had been made, and the industry with which he\r\nhad endeavoured to confute them. He mentioned the effect upon his\r\nresolutions produced by the failure of a letter. \"During our late walk,\"\r\ncontinued he, \"I introduced the subject that was nearest my heart.\r\nI re-urged all my former arguments, and placed them in more forcible\r\nlights. Wieland was still refractory. He expatiated on the perils of\r\nwealth and power, on the sacredness of conjugal and parental duties, and\r\nthe happiness of mediocrity.\r\n\r\n\"No wonder that the time passed, unperceived, away. Our whole souls were\r\nengaged in this cause. Several times we came to the foot of the rock;\r\nas soon as we perceived it, we changed our course, but never failed to\r\nterminate our circuitous and devious ramble at this spot. At length your\r\nbrother observed, 'We seem to be led hither by a kind of fatality. Since\r\nwe are so near, let us ascend and rest ourselves a while. If you are not\r\nweary of this argument we will resume it there.'\r\n\r\n\"I tacitly consented. We mounted the stairs, and drawing the sofa in\r\nfront of the river, we seated ourselves upon it. I took up the thread of\r\nour discourse where we had dropped it. I ridiculed his dread of the sea,\r\nand his attachment to home. I kept on in this strain, so congenial with\r\nmy disposition, for some time, uninterrupted by him. At length, he said\r\nto me, \"Suppose now that I, whom argument has not convinced, should\r\nyield to ridicule, and should agree that your scheme is eligible; what\r\nwill you have gained? Nothing. You have other enemies beside myself to\r\nencounter. When you have vanquished me, your toil has scarcely begun.\r\nThere are my sister and wife, with whom it will remain for you to\r\nmaintain the contest. And trust me, they are adversaries whom all your\r\nforce and stratagem will never subdue.\" I insinuated that they would\r\nmodel themselves by his will: that Catharine would think obedience her\r\nduty. He answered, with some quickness, \"You mistake. Their concurrence\r\nis indispensable. It is not my custom to exact sacrifices of this kind.\r\nI live to be their protector and friend, and not their tyrant and foe.\r\nIf my wife shall deem her happiness, and that of her children, most\r\nconsulted by remaining where she is, here she shall remain.\" \"But,\" said\r\nI, \"when she knows your pleasure, will she not conform to it?\" Before\r\nmy friend had time to answer this question, a negative was clearly and\r\ndistinctly uttered from another quarter. It did not come from one side\r\nor the other, from before us or behind. Whence then did it come? By\r\nwhose organs was it fashioned?\r\n\r\n\"If any uncertainty had existed with regard to these particulars, it\r\nwould have been removed by a deliberate and equally distinct repetition\r\nof the same monosyllable, \"No.\" The voice was my sister's. It appeared\r\nto come from the roof. I started from my seat. Catharine, exclaimed I,\r\nwhere are you? No answer was returned. I searched the room, and the\r\narea before it, but in vain. Your brother was motionless in his seat.\r\nI returned to him, and placed myself again by his side. My astonishment\r\nwas not less than his.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well,\" said he, at length, \"What think you of this? This is the\r\nself-same voice which I formerly heard; you are now convinced that my\r\nears were well informed.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes,\" said I, \"this, it is plain, is no fiction of the fancy.\" We again\r\nsunk into mutual and thoughtful silence. A recollection of the hour, and\r\nof the length of our absence, made me at last propose to return. We\r\nrose up for this purpose. In doing this, my mind reverted to the\r\ncontemplation of my own condition. \"Yes,\" said I aloud, but without\r\nparticularly addressing myself to Wieland, \"my resolution is taken. I\r\ncannot hope to prevail with my friends to accompany me. They may doze\r\naway their days on the banks of Schuylkill, but as to me, I go in the\r\nnext vessel; I will fly to her presence, and demand the reason of this\r\nextraordinary silence.\"\r\n\r\n\"I had scarcely finished the sentence, when the same mysterious voice\r\nexclaimed, \"You shall not go. The seal of death is on her lips. Her\r\nsilence is the silence of the tomb.\" Think of the effects which accents\r\nlike these must have had upon me. I shuddered as I listened. As soon as\r\nI recovered from my first amazement, \"Who is it that speaks?\" said I,\r\n\"whence did you procure these dismal tidings?\" I did not wait long for\r\nan answer. \"From a source that cannot fail. Be satisfied. She is dead.\"\r\nYou may justly be surprised, that, in the circumstances in which I heard\r\nthe tidings, and notwithstanding the mystery which environed him by whom\r\nthey were imparted, I could give an undivided attention to the facts,\r\nwhich were the subject of our dialogue. I eagerly inquired, when and\r\nwhere did she die? What was the cause of her death? Was her death\r\nabsolutely certain? An answer was returned only to the last of these\r\nquestions. \"Yes,\" was pronounced by the same voice; but it now sounded\r\nfrom a greater distance, and the deepest silence was all the return made\r\nto my subsequent interrogatories.\r\n\r\n\"It was my sister's voice; but it could not be uttered by her; and yet,\r\nif not by her, by whom was it uttered? When we returned hither, and\r\ndiscovered you together, the doubt that had previously existed was\r\nremoved. It was manifest that the intimation came not from her. Yet if\r\nnot from her, from whom could it come? Are the circumstances attending\r\nthe imparting of this news proof that the tidings are true? God forbid\r\nthat they should be true.\"\r\n\r\nHere Pleyel sunk into anxious silence, and gave me leisure to ruminate\r\non this inexplicable event. I am at a loss to describe the sensations\r\nthat affected me. I am not fearful of shadows. The tales of apparitions\r\nand enchantments did not possess that power over my belief which could\r\neven render them interesting. I saw nothing in them but ignorance and\r\nfolly, and was a stranger even to that terror which is pleasing. But\r\nthis incident was different from any that I had ever before known. Here\r\nwere proofs of a sensible and intelligent existence, which could not\r\nbe denied. Here was information obtained and imparted by means\r\nunquestionably super-human.\r\n\r\nThat there are conscious beings, beside ourselves, in existence, whose\r\nmodes of activity and information surpass our own, can scarcely be\r\ndenied. Is there a glimpse afforded us into a world of these superior\r\nbeings? My heart was scarcely large enough to give admittance to\r\nso swelling a thought. An awe, the sweetest and most solemn that\r\nimagination can conceive, pervaded my whole frame. It forsook me not\r\nwhen I parted from Pleyel and retired to my chamber. An impulse was\r\ngiven to my spirits utterly incompatible with sleep. I passed the night\r\nwakeful and full of meditation. I was impressed with the belief of\r\nmysterious, but not of malignant agency. Hitherto nothing had occurred\r\nto persuade me that this airy minister was busy to evil rather than to\r\ngood purposes. On the contrary, the idea of superior virtue had always\r\nbeen associated in my mind with that of superior power. The warnings\r\nthat had thus been heard appeared to have been prompted by beneficent\r\nintentions. My brother had been hindered by this voice from ascending\r\nthe hill. He was told that danger lurked in his path, and his obedience\r\nto the intimation had perhaps saved him from a destiny similar to that\r\nof my father.\r\n\r\nPleyel had been rescued from tormenting uncertainty, and from the\r\nhazards and fatigues of a fruitless voyage, by the same interposition.\r\nIt had assured him of the death of his Theresa.\r\n\r\nThis woman was then dead. A confirmation of the tidings, if true, would\r\nspeedily arrive. Was this confirmation to be deprecated or desired?\r\nBy her death, the tie that attached him to Europe, was taken away.\r\nHenceforward every motive would combine to retain him in his native\r\ncountry, and we were rescued from the deep regrets that would accompany\r\nhis hopeless absence from us. Propitious was the spirit that imparted\r\nthese tidings. Propitious he would perhaps have been, if he had been\r\ninstrumental in producing, as well as in communicating the tidings of\r\nher death. Propitious to us, the friends of Pleyel, to whom has thereby\r\nbeen secured the enjoyment of his society; and not unpropitious to\r\nhimself; for though this object of his love be snatched away, is there\r\nnot another who is able and willing to console him for her loss?\r\n\r\nTwenty days after this, another vessel arrived from the same port. In\r\nthis interval, Pleyel, for the most part, estranged himself from his old\r\ncompanions. He was become the prey of a gloomy and unsociable grief.\r\nHis walks were limited to the bank of the Delaware. This bank is an\r\nartificial one. Reeds and the river are on one side, and a watery marsh\r\non the other, in that part which bounded his lands, and which extended\r\nfrom the mouth of Hollander's creek to that of Schuylkill. No scene can\r\nbe imagined less enticing to a lover of the picturesque than this. The\r\nshore is deformed with mud, and incumbered with a forest of reeds. The\r\nfields, in most seasons, are mire; but when they afford a firm footing,\r\nthe ditches by which they are bounded and intersected, are mantled with\r\nstagnating green, and emit the most noxious exhalations. Health is no\r\nless a stranger to those seats than pleasure. Spring and autumn are sure\r\nto be accompanied with agues and bilious remittents.\r\n\r\nThe scenes which environed our dwellings at Mettingen constituted the\r\nreverse of this. Schuylkill was here a pure and translucid current,\r\nbroken into wild and ceaseless music by rocky points, murmuring on a\r\nsandy margin, and reflecting on its surface, banks of all varieties of\r\nheight and degrees of declivity. These banks were chequered by patches\r\nof dark verdure and shapeless masses of white marble, and crowned by\r\ncopses of cedar, or by the regular magnificence of orchards, which, at\r\nthis season, were in blossom, and were prodigal of odours. The ground\r\nwhich receded from the river was scooped into valleys and dales. Its\r\nbeauties were enhanced by the horticultural skill of my brother, who\r\nbedecked this exquisite assemblage of slopes and risings with every\r\nspecies of vegetable ornament, from the giant arms of the oak to the\r\nclustering tendrils of the honey-suckle.\r\n\r\nTo screen him from the unwholesome airs of his own residence, it had\r\nbeen proposed to Pleyel to spend the months of spring with us. He had\r\napparently acquiesced in this proposal; but the late event induced him\r\nto change his purpose. He was only to be seen by visiting him in his\r\nretirements. His gaiety had flown, and every passion was absorbed in\r\neagerness to procure tidings from Saxony. I have mentioned the arrival\r\nof another vessel from the Elbe. He descried her early one morning as\r\nhe was passing along the skirt of the river. She was easily recognized,\r\nbeing the ship in which he had performed his first voyage to Germany.\r\nHe immediately went on board, but found no letters directed to him.\r\nThis omission was, in some degree, compensated by meeting with an old\r\nacquaintance among the passengers, who had till lately been a resident\r\nin Leipsig. This person put an end to all suspense respecting the fate\r\nof Theresa, by relating the particulars of her death and funeral.\r\n\r\nThus was the truth of the former intimation attested. No longer devoured\r\nby suspense, the grief of Pleyel was not long in yielding to the\r\ninfluence of society. He gave himself up once more to our company. His\r\nvivacity had indeed been damped; but even in this respect he was a more\r\nacceptable companion than formerly, since his seriousness was neither\r\nincommunicative nor sullen.\r\n\r\nThese incidents, for a time, occupied all our thoughts. In me they\r\nproduced a sentiment not unallied to pleasure, and more speedily than in\r\nthe case of my friends were intermixed with other topics. My brother was\r\nparticularly affected by them. It was easy to perceive that most of his\r\nmeditations were tinctured from this source. To this was to be ascribed\r\na design in which his pen was, at this period, engaged, of collecting\r\nand investigating the facts which relate to that mysterious personage,\r\nthe Daemon of Socrates.\r\n\r\nMy brother's skill in Greek and Roman learning was exceeded by that of\r\nfew, and no doubt the world would have accepted a treatise upon this\r\nsubject from his hand with avidity; but alas! this and every other\r\nscheme of felicity and honor, were doomed to sudden blast and hopeless\r\nextermination.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter VI\r\n\r\n\r\nI now come to the mention of a person with whose name the most turbulent\r\nsensations are connected. It is with a shuddering reluctance that I\r\nenter on the province of describing him. Now it is that I begin to\r\nperceive the difficulty of the task which I have undertaken; but it\r\nwould be weakness to shrink from it. My blood is congealed: and my\r\nfingers are palsied when I call up his image. Shame upon my cowardly and\r\ninfirm heart! Hitherto I have proceeded with some degree of composure,\r\nbut now I must pause. I mean not that dire remembrance shall subdue my\r\ncourage or baffle my design, but this weakness cannot be immediately\r\nconquered. I must desist for a little while.\r\n\r\nI have taken a few turns in my chamber, and have gathered strength\r\nenough to proceed. Yet have I not projected a task beyond my power to\r\nexecute? If thus, on the very threshold of the scene, my knees faulter\r\nand I sink, how shall I support myself, when I rush into the midst of\r\nhorrors such as no heart has hitherto conceived, nor tongue related? I\r\nsicken and recoil at the prospect, and yet my irresolution is momentary.\r\nI have not formed this design upon slight grounds, and though I may at\r\ntimes pause and hesitate, I will not be finally diverted from it.\r\n\r\nAnd thou, O most fatal and potent of mankind, in what terms shall I\r\ndescribe thee? What words are adequate to the just delineation of thy\r\ncharacter? How shall I detail the means which rendered the secrecy of\r\nthy purposes unfathomable? But I will not anticipate. Let me recover\r\nif possible, a sober strain. Let me keep down the flood of passion that\r\nwould render me precipitate or powerless. Let me stifle the agonies that\r\nare awakened by thy name. Let me, for a time, regard thee as a being\r\nof no terrible attributes. Let me tear myself from contemplation of\r\nthe evils of which it is but too certain that thou wast the author, and\r\nlimit my view to those harmless appearances which attended thy entrance\r\non the stage.\r\n\r\nOne sunny afternoon, I was standing in the door of my house, when I\r\nmarked a person passing close to the edge of the bank that was in\r\nfront. His pace was a careless and lingering one, and had none of that\r\ngracefulness and ease which distinguish a person with certain advantages\r\nof education from a clown. His gait was rustic and aukward. His form was\r\nungainly and disproportioned. Shoulders broad and square, breast sunken,\r\nhis head drooping, his body of uniform breadth, supported by long and\r\nlank legs, were the ingredients of his frame. His garb was not ill\r\nadapted to such a figure. A slouched hat, tarnished by the weather, a\r\ncoat of thick grey cloth, cut and wrought, as it seemed, by a country\r\ntailor, blue worsted stockings, and shoes fastened by thongs, and deeply\r\ndiscoloured by dust, which brush had never disturbed, constituted his\r\ndress.\r\n\r\nThere was nothing remarkable in these appearances; they were frequently\r\nto be met with on the road, and in the harvest field. I cannot tell why\r\nI gazed upon them, on this occasion, with more than ordinary attention,\r\nunless it were that such figures were seldom seen by me, except on the\r\nroad or field. This lawn was only traversed by men whose views were\r\ndirected to the pleasures of the walk, or the grandeur of the scenery.\r\n\r\nHe passed slowly along, frequently pausing, as if to examine the\r\nprospect more deliberately, but never turning his eye towards the house,\r\nso as to allow me a view of his countenance. Presently, he entered a\r\ncopse at a small distance, and disappeared. My eye followed him while\r\nhe remained in sight. If his image remained for any duration in my fancy\r\nafter his departure, it was because no other object occurred sufficient\r\nto expel it.\r\n\r\nI continued in the same spot for half an hour, vaguely, and by fits,\r\ncontemplating the image of this wanderer, and drawing, from outward\r\nappearances, those inferences with respect to the intellectual history\r\nof this person, which experience affords us. I reflected on the\r\nalliance which commonly subsists between ignorance and the practice\r\nof agriculture, and indulged myself in airy speculations as to the\r\ninfluence of progressive knowledge in dissolving this alliance, and\r\nembodying the dreams of the poets. I asked why the plough and the hoe\r\nmight not become the trade of every human being, and how this\r\ntrade might be made conducive to, or, at least, consistent with the\r\nacquisition of wisdom and eloquence.\r\n\r\nWeary with these reflections, I returned to the kitchen to perform some\r\nhousehold office. I had usually but one servant, and she was a girl\r\nabout my own age. I was busy near the chimney, and she was employed near\r\nthe door of the apartment, when some one knocked. The door was opened by\r\nher, and she was immediately addressed with \"Pry'thee, good girl, canst\r\nthou supply a thirsty man with a glass of buttermilk?\" She answered\r\nthat there was none in the house. \"Aye, but there is some in the dairy\r\nyonder. Thou knowest as well as I, though Hermes never taught thee, that\r\nthough every dairy be an house, every house is not a dairy.\" To\r\nthis speech, though she understood only a part of it, she replied\r\nby repeating her assurances, that she had none to give. \"Well then,\"\r\nrejoined the stranger, \"for charity's sweet sake, hand me forth a cup\r\nof cold water.\" The girl said she would go to the spring and fetch it.\r\n\"Nay, give me the cup, and suffer me to help myself. Neither manacled\r\nnor lame, I should merit burial in the maw of carrion crows, if I laid\r\nthis task upon thee.\" She gave him the cup, and he turned to go to the\r\nspring.\r\n\r\nI listened to this dialogue in silence. The words uttered by the person\r\nwithout, affected me as somewhat singular, but what chiefly rendered\r\nthem remarkable, was the tone that accompanied them. It was wholly new.\r\nMy brother's voice and Pleyel's were musical and energetic. I had fondly\r\nimagined, that, in this respect, they were surpassed by none. Now my\r\nmistake was detected. I cannot pretend to communicate the impression\r\nthat was made upon me by these accents, or to depict the degree in which\r\nforce and sweetness were blended in them. They were articulated with a\r\ndistinctness that was unexampled in my experience. But this was not all.\r\nThe voice was not only mellifluent and clear, but the emphasis was so\r\njust, and the modulation so impassioned, that it seemed as if an heart\r\nof stone could not fail of being moved by it. It imparted to me an\r\nemotion altogether involuntary and incontroulable. When he uttered the\r\nwords \"for charity's sweet sake,\" I dropped the cloth that I held in\r\nmy hand, my heart overflowed with sympathy, and my eyes with unbidden\r\ntears.\r\n\r\nThis description will appear to you trifling or incredible. The\r\nimportance of these circumstances will be manifested in the sequel.\r\nThe manner in which I was affected on this occasion, was, to my own\r\napprehension, a subject of astonishment. The tones were indeed such as\r\nI never heard before; but that they should, in an instant, as it were,\r\ndissolve me in tears, will not easily be believed by others, and can\r\nscarcely be comprehended by myself.\r\n\r\nIt will be readily supposed that I was somewhat inquisitive as to the\r\nperson and demeanour of our visitant. After a moment's pause, I stepped\r\nto the door and looked after him. Judge my surprize, when I beheld the\r\nself-same figure that had appeared an half hour before upon the bank. My\r\nfancy had conjured up a very different image. A form, and attitude, and\r\ngarb, were instantly created worthy to accompany such elocution; but\r\nthis person was, in all visible respects, the reverse of this phantom.\r\nStrange as it may seem, I could not speedily reconcile myself to this\r\ndisappointment. Instead of returning to my employment, I threw myself\r\nin a chair that was placed opposite the door, and sunk into a fit of\r\nmusing.\r\n\r\nMy attention was, in a few minutes, recalled by the stranger, who\r\nreturned with the empty cup in his hand. I had not thought of the\r\ncircumstance, or should certainly have chosen a different seat. He no\r\nsooner shewed himself, than a confused sense of impropriety, added to\r\nthe suddenness of the interview, for which, not having foreseen it,\r\nI had made no preparation, threw me into a state of the most painful\r\nembarrassment. He brought with him a placid brow; but no sooner had he\r\ncast his eyes upon me, than his face was as glowingly suffused as\r\nmy own. He placed the cup upon the bench, stammered out thanks, and\r\nretired.\r\n\r\nIt was some time before I could recover my wonted composure. I had\r\nsnatched a view of the stranger's countenance. The impression that it\r\nmade was vivid and indelible. His cheeks were pallid and lank, his eyes\r\nsunken, his forehead overshadowed by coarse straggling hairs, his teeth\r\nlarge and irregular, though sound and brilliantly white, and his chin\r\ndiscoloured by a tetter. His skin was of coarse grain, and sallow hue.\r\nEvery feature was wide of beauty, and the outline of his face reminded\r\nyou of an inverted cone.\r\n\r\nAnd yet his forehead, so far as shaggy locks would allow it to be seen,\r\nhis eyes lustrously black, and possessing, in the midst of haggardness,\r\na radiance inexpressibly serene and potent, and something in the rest of\r\nhis features, which it would be in vain to describe, but which served to\r\nbetoken a mind of the highest order, were essential ingredients in the\r\nportrait. This, in the effects which immediately flowed from it, I count\r\namong the most extraordinary incidents of my life. This face, seen for\r\na moment, continued for hours to occupy my fancy, to the exclusion of\r\nalmost every other image. I had purposed to spend the evening with my\r\nbrother, but I could not resist the inclination of forming a sketch\r\nupon paper of this memorable visage. Whether my hand was aided by any\r\npeculiar inspiration, or I was deceived by my own fond conceptions, this\r\nportrait, though hastily executed, appeared unexceptionable to my own\r\ntaste.\r\n\r\nI placed it at all distances, and in all lights; my eyes were rivetted\r\nupon it. Half the night passed away in wakefulness and in contemplation\r\nof this picture. So flexible, and yet so stubborn, is the human mind.\r\nSo obedient to impulses the most transient and brief, and yet so\r\nunalterably observant of the direction which is given to it! How little\r\ndid I then foresee the termination of that chain, of which this may be\r\nregarded as the first link?\r\n\r\nNext day arose in darkness and storm. Torrents of rain fell during\r\nthe whole day, attended with incessant thunder, which reverberated in\r\nstunning echoes from the opposite declivity. The inclemency of the air\r\nwould not allow me to walk-out. I had, indeed, no inclination to leave\r\nmy apartment. I betook myself to the contemplation of this portrait,\r\nwhose attractions time had rather enhanced than diminished. I laid aside\r\nmy usual occupations, and seating myself at a window, consumed the day\r\nin alternately looking out upon the storm, and gazing at the picture\r\nwhich lay upon a table before me. You will, perhaps, deem this conduct\r\nsomewhat singular, and ascribe it to certain peculiarities of temper. I\r\nam not aware of any such peculiarities. I can account for my devotion to\r\nthis image no otherwise, than by supposing that its properties were\r\nrare and prodigious. Perhaps you will suspect that such were the\r\nfirst inroads of a passion incident to every female heart, and\r\nwhich frequently gains a footing by means even more slight, and more\r\nimprobable than these. I shall not controvert the reasonableness of the\r\nsuspicion, but leave you at liberty to draw, from my narrative, what\r\nconclusions you please.\r\n\r\nNight at length returned, and the storm ceased. The air was once more\r\nclear and calm, and bore an affecting contrast to that uproar of the\r\nelements by which it had been preceded. I spent the darksome hours, as\r\nI spent the day, contemplative and seated at the window. Why was my mind\r\nabsorbed in thoughts ominous and dreary? Why did my bosom heave with\r\nsighs, and my eyes overflow with tears? Was the tempest that had just\r\npast a signal of the ruin which impended over me? My soul fondly dwelt\r\nupon the images of my brother and his children, yet they only increased\r\nthe mournfulness of my contemplations. The smiles of the charming babes\r\nwere as bland as formerly. The same dignity sat on the brow of their\r\nfather, and yet I thought of them with anguish. Something whispered\r\nthat the happiness we at present enjoyed was set on mutable foundations.\r\nDeath must happen to all. Whether our felicity was to be subverted by it\r\nto-morrow, or whether it was ordained that we should lay down our heads\r\nfull of years and of honor, was a question that no human being could\r\nsolve. At other times, these ideas seldom intruded. I either forbore to\r\nreflect upon the destiny that is reserved for all men, or the reflection\r\nwas mixed up with images that disrobed it of terror; but now the\r\nuncertainty of life occurred to me without any of its usual and\r\nalleviating accompaniments. I said to myself, we must die. Sooner or\r\nlater, we must disappear for ever from the face of the earth. Whatever\r\nbe the links that hold us to life, they must be broken. This scene\r\nof existence is, in all its parts, calamitous. The greater number is\r\noppressed with immediate evils, and those, the tide of whose fortunes is\r\nfull, how small is their portion of enjoyment, since they know that it\r\nwill terminate.\r\n\r\nFor some time I indulged myself, without reluctance, in these gloomy\r\nthoughts; but at length, the dejection which they produced became\r\ninsupportably painful. I endeavoured to dissipate it with music. I had\r\nall my grand-father's melody as well as poetry by rote. I now lighted\r\nby chance on a ballad, which commemorated the fate of a German Cavalier,\r\nwho fell at the siege of Nice under Godfrey of Bouillon. My choice was\r\nunfortunate, for the scenes of violence and carnage which were here\r\nwildly but forcibly pourtrayed, only suggested to my thoughts a new\r\ntopic in the horrors of war.\r\n\r\nI sought refuge, but ineffectually, in sleep. My mind was thronged by\r\nvivid, but confused images, and no effort that I made was sufficient to\r\ndrive them away. In this situation I heard the clock, which hung in\r\nthe room, give the signal for twelve. It was the same instrument which\r\nformerly hung in my father's chamber, and which, on account of its\r\nbeing his workmanship, was regarded, by every one of our family, with\r\nveneration. It had fallen to me, in the division of his property, and\r\nwas placed in this asylum. The sound awakened a series of reflections,\r\nrespecting his death. I was not allowed to pursue them; for scarcely\r\nhad the vibrations ceased, when my attention was attracted by a whisper,\r\nwhich, at first, appeared to proceed from lips that were laid close to\r\nmy ear.\r\n\r\nNo wonder that a circumstance like this startled me. In the first\r\nimpulse of my terror, I uttered a slight scream, and shrunk to the\r\nopposite side of the bed. In a moment, however, I recovered from my\r\ntrepidation. I was habitually indifferent to all the causes of fear,\r\nby which the majority are afflicted. I entertained no apprehension\r\nof either ghosts or robbers. Our security had never been molested by\r\neither, and I made use of no means to prevent or counterwork their\r\nmachinations. My tranquillity, on this occasion, was quickly retrieved.\r\nThe whisper evidently proceeded from one who was posted at my bed-side.\r\nThe first idea that suggested itself was, that it was uttered by the\r\ngirl who lived with me as a servant. Perhaps, somewhat had alarmed her,\r\nor she was sick, and had come to request my assistance. By whispering in\r\nmy ear, she intended to rouse without alarming me.\r\n\r\nFull of this persuasion, I called; \"Judith,\" said I, \"is it you? What\r\ndo you want? Is there any thing the matter with you?\" No answer was\r\nreturned. I repeated my inquiry, but equally in vain. Cloudy as was the\r\natmosphere, and curtained as my bed was, nothing was visible. I withdrew\r\nthe curtain, and leaning my head on my elbow, I listened with the\r\ndeepest attention to catch some new sound. Meanwhile, I ran over in my\r\nthoughts, every circumstance that could assist my conjectures.\r\n\r\nMy habitation was a wooden edifice, consisting of two stories. In each\r\nstory were two rooms, separated by an entry, or middle passage, with\r\nwhich they communicated by opposite doors. The passage, on the lower\r\nstory, had doors at the two ends, and a stair-case. Windows answered to\r\nthe doors on the upper story. Annexed to this, on the eastern side, were\r\nwings, divided, in like manner, into an upper and lower room; one of\r\nthem comprized a kitchen, and chamber above it for the servant, and\r\ncommunicated, on both stories, with the parlour adjoining it below,\r\nand the chamber adjoining it above. The opposite wing is of smaller\r\ndimensions, the rooms not being above eight feet square. The lower of\r\nthese was used as a depository of household implements, the upper was a\r\ncloset in which I deposited my books and papers. They had but one inlet,\r\nwhich was from the room adjoining. There was no window in the lower one,\r\nand in the upper, a small aperture which communicated light and air, but\r\nwould scarcely admit the body. The door which led into this, was close\r\nto my bed-head, and was always locked, but when I myself was within. The\r\navenues below were accustomed to be closed and bolted at nights.\r\n\r\nThe maid was my only companion, and she could not reach my chamber\r\nwithout previously passing through the opposite chamber, and the middle\r\npassage, of which, however, the doors were usually unfastened. If she\r\nhad occasioned this noise, she would have answered my repeated calls.\r\nNo other conclusion, therefore, was left me, but that I had mistaken the\r\nsounds, and that my imagination had transformed some casual noise into\r\nthe voice of a human creature. Satisfied with this solution, I was\r\npreparing to relinquish my listening attitude, when my ear was again\r\nsaluted with a new and yet louder whispering. It appeared, as before,\r\nto issue from lips that touched my pillow. A second effort of attention,\r\nhowever, clearly shewed me, that the sounds issued from within the\r\ncloset, the door of which was not more than eight inches from my pillow.\r\n\r\nThis second interruption occasioned a shock less vehement than the\r\nformer. I started, but gave no audible token of alarm. I was so much\r\nmistress of my feelings, as to continue listening to what should be\r\nsaid. The whisper was distinct, hoarse, and uttered so as to shew that\r\nthe speaker was desirous of being heard by some one near, but, at the\r\nsame time, studious to avoid being overheard by any other.\r\n\r\n\"Stop, stop, I say; madman as you are! there are better means than that.\r\nCurse upon your rashness! There is no need to shoot.\"\r\n\r\nSuch were the words uttered in a tone of eagerness and anger, within so\r\nsmall a distance of my pillow. What construction could I put upon\r\nthem? My heart began to palpitate with dread of some unknown danger.\r\nPresently, another voice, but equally near me, was heard whispering in\r\nanswer. \"Why not? I will draw a trigger in this business, but perdition\r\nbe my lot if I do more.\" To this, the first voice returned, in a tone\r\nwhich rage had heightened in a small degree above a whisper, \"Coward!\r\nstand aside, and see me do it. I will grasp her throat; I will do her\r\nbusiness in an instant; she shall not have time so much as to groan.\"\r\nWhat wonder that I was petrified by sounds so dreadful! Murderers\r\nlurked in my closet. They were planning the means of my destruction. One\r\nresolved to shoot, and the other menaced suffocation. Their means being\r\nchosen, they would forthwith break the door. Flight instantly suggested\r\nitself as most eligible in circumstances so perilous. I deliberated not\r\na moment; but, fear adding wings to my speed, I leaped out of bed, and\r\nscantily robed as I was, rushed out of the chamber, down stairs, and\r\ninto the open air. I can hardly recollect the process of turning\r\nkeys, and withdrawing bolts. My terrors urged me forward with almost a\r\nmechanical impulse. I stopped not till I reached my brother's door.\r\nI had not gained the threshold, when, exhausted by the violence of my\r\nemotions, and by my speed, I sunk down in a fit.\r\n\r\nHow long I remained in this situation I know not. When I recovered, I\r\nfound myself stretched on a bed, surrounded by my sister and her\r\nfemale servants. I was astonished at the scene before me, but gradually\r\nrecovered the recollection of what had happened. I answered their\r\nimportunate inquiries as well as I was able. My brother and Pleyel,\r\nwhom the storm of the preceding day chanced to detain here, informing\r\nthemselves of every particular, proceeded with lights and weapons to my\r\ndeserted habitation. They entered my chamber and my closet, and found\r\nevery thing in its proper place and customary order. The door of the\r\ncloset was locked, and appeared not to have been opened in my absence.\r\nThey went to Judith's apartment. They found her asleep and in safety.\r\nPleyel's caution induced him to forbear alarming the girl; and finding\r\nher wholly ignorant of what had passed, they directed her to return to\r\nher chamber. They then fastened the doors, and returned.\r\n\r\nMy friends were disposed to regard this transaction as a dream. That\r\npersons should be actually immured in this closet, to which, in the\r\ncircumstances of the time, access from without or within was apparently\r\nimpossible, they could not seriously believe. That any human beings\r\nhad intended murder, unless it were to cover a scheme of pillage, was\r\nincredible; but that no such design had been formed, was evident\r\nfrom the security in which the furniture of the house and the closet\r\nremained.\r\n\r\nI revolved every incident and expression that had occurred. My\r\nsenses assured me of the truth of them, and yet their abruptness and\r\nimprobability made me, in my turn, somewhat incredulous. The adventure\r\nhad made a deep impression on my fancy, and it was not till after a\r\nweek's abode at my brother's, that I resolved to resume the possession\r\nof my own dwelling. There was another circumstance that enhanced the\r\nmysteriousness of this event. After my recovery it was obvious to\r\ninquire by what means the attention of the family had been drawn to my\r\nsituation. I had fallen before I had reached the threshold, or was able\r\nto give any signal. My brother related, that while this was transacting\r\nin my chamber, he himself was awake, in consequence of some slight\r\nindisposition, and lay, according to his custom, musing on some favorite\r\ntopic. Suddenly the silence, which was remarkably profound, was broken\r\nby a voice of most piercing shrillness, that seemed to be uttered by one\r\nin the hall below his chamber. \"Awake! arise!\" it exclaimed: \"hasten to\r\nsuccour one that is dying at your door.\"\r\n\r\nThis summons was effectual. There was no one in the house who was not\r\nroused by it. Pleyel was the first to obey, and my brother overtook him\r\nbefore he reached the hall. What was the general astonishment when your\r\nfriend was discovered stretched upon the grass before the door, pale,\r\nghastly, and with every mark of death!\r\n\r\nThis was the third instance of a voice, exerted for the benefit of this\r\nlittle community. The agent was no less inscrutable in this, than in the\r\nformer case. When I ruminated upon these events, my soul was suspended\r\nin wonder and awe. Was I really deceived in imagining that I heard the\r\ncloset conversation? I was no longer at liberty to question the reality\r\nof those accents which had formerly recalled my brother from the hill;\r\nwhich had imparted tidings of the death of the German lady to Pleyel;\r\nand which had lately summoned them to my assistance.\r\n\r\nBut how was I to regard this midnight conversation? Hoarse and manlike\r\nvoices conferring on the means of death, so near my bed, and at such\r\nan hour! How had my ancient security vanished! That dwelling, which had\r\nhitherto been an inviolate asylum, was now beset with danger to my\r\nlife. That solitude, formerly so dear to me, could no longer be endured.\r\nPleyel, who had consented to reside with us during the months of spring,\r\nlodged in the vacant chamber, in order to quiet my alarms. He treated\r\nmy fears with ridicule, and in a short time very slight traces of them\r\nremained: but as it was wholly indifferent to him whether his nights\r\nwere passed at my house or at my brother's, this arrangement gave\r\ngeneral satisfaction.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter VII\r\n\r\n\r\nI will not enumerate the various inquiries and conjectures which these\r\nincidents occasioned. After all our efforts, we came no nearer to\r\ndispelling the mist in which they were involved; and time, instead of\r\nfacilitating a solution, only accumulated our doubts. In the midst of\r\nthoughts excited by these events, I was not unmindful of my interview\r\nwith the stranger. I related the particulars, and shewed the portrait to\r\nmy friends. Pleyel recollected to have met with a figure resembling\r\nmy description in the city; but neither his face or garb made the same\r\nimpression upon him that it made upon me. It was a hint to rally me upon\r\nmy prepossessions, and to amuse us with a thousand ludicrous anecdotes\r\nwhich he had collected in his travels. He made no scruple to charge me\r\nwith being in love; and threatened to inform the swain, when he met him,\r\nof his good fortune.\r\n\r\nPleyel's temper made him susceptible of no durable impressions. His\r\nconversation was occasionally visited by gleams of his ancient vivacity;\r\nbut, though his impetuosity was sometimes inconvenient, there was\r\nnothing to dread from his malice. I had no fear that my character or\r\ndignity would suffer in his hands, and was not heartily displeased when\r\nhe declared his intention of profiting by his first meeting with the\r\nstranger to introduce him to our acquaintance.\r\n\r\nSome weeks after this I had spent a toilsome day, and, as the sun\r\ndeclined, found myself disposed to seek relief in a walk. The river\r\nbank is, at this part of it, and for some considerable space upward,\r\nso rugged and steep as not to be easily descended. In a recess of this\r\ndeclivity, near the southern verge of my little demesne, was placed a\r\nslight building, with seats and lattices. From a crevice of the rock,\r\nto which this edifice was attached, there burst forth a stream of the\r\npurest water, which, leaping from ledge to ledge, for the space of sixty\r\nfeet, produced a freshness in the air, and a murmur, the most delicious\r\nand soothing imaginable. These, added to the odours of the cedars\r\nwhich embowered it, and of the honey-suckle which clustered among the\r\nlattices, rendered this my favorite retreat in summer.\r\n\r\nOn this occasion I repaired hither. My spirits drooped through the\r\nfatigue of long attention, and I threw myself upon a bench, in a state,\r\nboth mentally and personally, of the utmost supineness. The lulling\r\nsounds of the waterfall, the fragrance and the dusk combined to becalm\r\nmy spirits, and, in a short time, to sink me into sleep. Either the\r\nuneasiness of my posture, or some slight indisposition molested my\r\nrepose with dreams of no cheerful hue. After various incoherences\r\nhad taken their turn to occupy my fancy, I at length imagined myself\r\nwalking, in the evening twilight, to my brother's habitation. A pit,\r\nmethought, had been dug in the path I had taken, of which I was not\r\naware. As I carelessly pursued my walk, I thought I saw my brother,\r\nstanding at some distance before me, beckoning and calling me to make\r\nhaste. He stood on the opposite edge of the gulph. I mended my pace, and\r\none step more would have plunged me into this abyss, had not some\r\none from behind caught suddenly my arm, and exclaimed, in a voice of\r\neagerness and terror, \"Hold! hold!\"\r\n\r\nThe sound broke my sleep, and I found myself, at the next moment,\r\nstanding on my feet, and surrounded by the deepest darkness. Images\r\nso terrific and forcible disabled me, for a time, from distinguishing\r\nbetween sleep and wakefulness, and withheld from me the knowledge of my\r\nactual condition. My first panics were succeeded by the perturbations of\r\nsurprize, to find myself alone in the open air, and immersed in so deep\r\na gloom. I slowly recollected the incidents of the afternoon, and how\r\nI came hither. I could not estimate the time, but saw the propriety of\r\nreturning with speed to the house. My faculties were still too confused,\r\nand the darkness too intense, to allow me immediately to find my way up\r\nthe steep. I sat down, therefore, to recover myself, and to reflect upon\r\nmy situation.\r\n\r\nThis was no sooner done, than a low voice was heard from behind the\r\nlattice, on the side where I sat. Between the rock and the lattice was a\r\nchasm not wide enough to admit a human body; yet, in this chasm he that\r\nspoke appeared to be stationed. \"Attend! attend! but be not terrified.\"\r\n\r\nI started and exclaimed, \"Good heavens! what is that? Who are you?\"\r\n\r\n\"A friend; one come, not to injure, but to save you; fear nothing.\"\r\n\r\nThis voice was immediately recognized to be the same with one of\r\nthose which I had heard in the closet; it was the voice of him who had\r\nproposed to shoot, rather than to strangle, his victim. My terror made\r\nme, at once, mute and motionless. He continued, \"I leagued to murder\r\nyou. I repent. Mark my bidding, and be safe. Avoid this spot. The snares\r\nof death encompass it. Elsewhere danger will be distant; but this spot,\r\nshun it as you value your life. Mark me further; profit by this warning,\r\nbut divulge it not. If a syllable of what has passed escape you, your\r\ndoom is sealed. Remember your father, and be faithful.\"\r\n\r\nHere the accents ceased, and left me overwhelmed with dismay. I was\r\nfraught with the persuasion, that during every moment I remained here,\r\nmy life was endangered; but I could not take a step without hazard of\r\nfalling to the bottom of the precipice. The path, leading to the summit,\r\nwas short, but rugged and intricate. Even star-light was excluded by the\r\numbrage, and not the faintest gleam was afforded to guide my steps. What\r\nshould I do? To depart or remain was equally and eminently perilous.\r\n\r\nIn this state of uncertainty, I perceived a ray flit across the gloom\r\nand disappear. Another succeeded, which was stronger, and remained for\r\na passing moment. It glittered on the shrubs that were scattered at the\r\nentrance, and gleam continued to succeed gleam for a few seconds, till\r\nthey, finally, gave place to unintermitted darkness.\r\n\r\nThe first visitings of this light called up a train of horrors in my\r\nmind; destruction impended over this spot; the voice which I had lately\r\nheard had warned me to retire, and had menaced me with the fate of my\r\nfather if I refused. I was desirous, but unable, to obey; these gleams\r\nwere such as preluded the stroke by which he fell; the hour, perhaps,\r\nwas the same--I shuddered as if I had beheld, suspended over me, the\r\nexterminating sword.\r\n\r\nPresently a new and stronger illumination burst through the lattice\r\non the right hand, and a voice, from the edge of the precipice above,\r\ncalled out my name. It was Pleyel. Joyfully did I recognize his accents;\r\nbut such was the tumult of my thoughts that I had not power to answer\r\nhim till he had frequently repeated his summons. I hurried, at length,\r\nfrom the fatal spot, and, directed by the lanthorn which he bore,\r\nascended the hill.\r\n\r\nPale and breathless, it was with difficulty I could support myself. He\r\nanxiously inquired into the cause of my affright, and the motive of my\r\nunusual absence. He had returned from my brother's at a late hour, and\r\nwas informed by Judith, that I had walked out before sun-set, and had\r\nnot yet returned. This intelligence was somewhat alarming. He waited\r\nsome time; but, my absence continuing, he had set out in search of me.\r\nHe had explored the neighbourhood with the utmost care, but, receiving\r\nno tidings of me, he was preparing to acquaint my brother with this\r\ncircumstance, when he recollected the summer-house on the bank, and\r\nconceived it possible that some accident had detained me there. He again\r\ninquired into the cause of this detention, and of that confusion and\r\ndismay which my looks testified.\r\n\r\nI told him that I had strolled hither in the afternoon, that sleep had\r\novertaken me as I sat, and that I had awakened a few minutes before\r\nhis arrival. I could tell him no more. In the present impetuosity of my\r\nthoughts, I was almost dubious, whether the pit, into which my brother\r\nhad endeavoured to entice me, and the voice that talked through the\r\nlattice, were not parts of the same dream. I remembered, likewise, the\r\ncharge of secrecy, and the penalty denounced, if I should rashly divulge\r\nwhat I had heard. For these reasons, I was silent on that subject, and\r\nshutting myself in my chamber, delivered myself up to contemplation.\r\n\r\nWhat I have related will, no doubt, appear to you a fable. You will\r\nbelieve that calamity has subverted my reason, and that I am amusing\r\nyou with the chimeras of my brain, instead of facts that have really\r\nhappened. I shall not be surprized or offended, if these be your\r\nsuspicions. I know not, indeed, how you can deny them admission. For, if\r\nto me, the immediate witness, they were fertile of perplexity and doubt,\r\nhow must they affect another to whom they are recommended only by\r\nmy testimony? It was only by subsequent events, that I was fully and\r\nincontestibly assured of the veracity of my senses.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile what was I to think? I had been assured that a design had been\r\nformed against my life. The ruffians had leagued to murder me. Whom had\r\nI offended? Who was there with whom I had ever maintained intercourse,\r\nwho was capable of harbouring such atrocious purposes?\r\n\r\nMy temper was the reverse of cruel and imperious. My heart was touched\r\nwith sympathy for the children of misfortune. But this sympathy was not\r\na barren sentiment. My purse, scanty as it was, was ever open, and my\r\nhands ever active, to relieve distress. Many were the wretches whom\r\nmy personal exertions had extricated from want and disease, and who\r\nrewarded me with their gratitude. There was no face which lowered at my\r\napproach, and no lips which uttered imprecations in my hearing. On the\r\ncontrary, there was none, over whose fate I had exerted any influence,\r\nor to whom I was known by reputation, who did not greet me with smiles,\r\nand dismiss me with proofs of veneration; yet did not my senses assure\r\nme that a plot was laid against my life?\r\n\r\nI am not destitute of courage. I have shewn myself deliberative and calm\r\nin the midst of peril. I have hazarded my own life, for the preservation\r\nof another, but now was I confused and panic struck. I have not lived\r\nso as to fear death, yet to perish by an unseen and secret stroke, to be\r\nmangled by the knife of an assassin was a thought at which I shuddered;\r\nwhat had I done to deserve to be made the victim of malignant passions?\r\n\r\nBut soft! was I not assured, that my life was safe in all places but\r\none? And why was the treason limited to take effect in this spot? I\r\nwas every where equally defenceless. My house and chamber were, at all\r\ntimes, accessible. Danger still impended over me; the bloody purpose was\r\nstill entertained, but the hand that was to execute it, was powerless in\r\nall places but one!\r\n\r\nHere I had remained for the last four or five hours, without the means\r\nof resistance or defence, yet I had not been attacked. A human being was\r\nat hand, who was conscious of my presence, and warned me hereafter to\r\navoid this retreat. His voice was not absolutely new, but had I never\r\nheard it but once before? But why did he prohibit me from relating\r\nthis incident to others, and what species of death will be awarded if I\r\ndisobey?\r\n\r\nHe talked of my father. He intimated, that disclosure would pull upon my\r\nhead, the same destruction. Was then the death of my father, portentous\r\nand inexplicable as it was, the consequence of human machinations? It\r\nshould seem, that this being is apprised of the true nature of this\r\nevent, and is conscious of the means that led to it. Whether it shall\r\nlikewise fall upon me, depends upon the observance of silence. Was it\r\nthe infraction of a similar command, that brought so horrible a penalty\r\nupon my father?\r\n\r\nSuch were the reflections that haunted me during the night, and which\r\neffectually deprived me of sleep. Next morning, at breakfast, Pleyel\r\nrelated an event which my disappearance had hindered him from mentioning\r\nthe night before. Early the preceding morning, his occasions called him\r\nto the city; he had stepped into a coffee-house to while away an hour;\r\nhere he had met a person whose appearance instantly bespoke him to be\r\nthe same whose hasty visit I have mentioned, and whose extraordinary\r\nvisage and tones had so powerfully affected me. On an attentive survey,\r\nhowever, he proved, likewise, to be one with whom my friend had had some\r\nintercourse in Europe. This authorised the liberty of accosting him, and\r\nafter some conversation, mindful, as Pleyel said, of the footing which\r\nthis stranger had gained in my heart, he had ventured to invite him\r\nto Mettingen. The invitation had been cheerfully accepted, and a visit\r\npromised on the afternoon of the next day.\r\n\r\nThis information excited no sober emotions in my breast. I was, of\r\ncourse, eager to be informed as to the circumstances of their ancient\r\nintercourse. When, and where had they met? What knew he of the life and\r\ncharacter of this man?\r\n\r\nIn answer to my inquiries, he informed me that, three years before,\r\nhe was a traveller in Spain. He had made an excursion from Valencia to\r\nMurviedro, with a view to inspect the remains of Roman magnificence,\r\nscattered in the environs of that town. While traversing the scite\r\nof the theatre of old Saguntum, he lighted upon this man, seated on a\r\nstone, and deeply engaged in perusing the work of the deacon Marti. A\r\nshort conversation ensued, which proved the stranger to be English. They\r\nreturned to Valencia together.\r\n\r\nHis garb, aspect, and deportment, were wholly Spanish. A residence of\r\nthree years in the country, indefatigable attention to the language,\r\nand a studious conformity with the customs of the people, had made him\r\nindistinguishable from a native, when he chose to assume that character.\r\nPleyel found him to be connected, on the footing of friendship and\r\nrespect, with many eminent merchants in that city. He had embraced the\r\ncatholic religion, and adopted a Spanish name instead of his own, which\r\nwas CARWIN, and devoted himself to the literature and religion of his\r\nnew country. He pursued no profession, but subsisted on remittances from\r\nEngland.\r\n\r\nWhile Pleyel remained in Valencia, Carwin betrayed no aversion to\r\nintercourse, and the former found no small attractions in the society of\r\nthis new acquaintance. On general topics he was highly intelligent and\r\ncommunicative. He had visited every corner of Spain, and could furnish\r\nthe most accurate details respecting its ancient and present state.\r\nOn topics of religion and of his own history, previous to his\r\nTRANSFORMATION into a Spaniard, he was invariably silent. You could\r\nmerely gather from his discourse that he was English, and that he was\r\nwell acquainted with the neighbouring countries.\r\n\r\nHis character excited considerable curiosity in this observer. It was\r\nnot easy to reconcile his conversion to the Romish faith, with those\r\nproofs of knowledge and capacity that were exhibited by him on different\r\noccasions. A suspicion was, sometimes, admitted, that his belief was\r\ncounterfeited for some political purpose. The most careful observation,\r\nhowever, produced no discovery. His manners were, at all times, harmless\r\nand inartificial, and his habits those of a lover of contemplation and\r\nseclusion. He appeared to have contracted an affection for Pleyel, who\r\nwas not slow to return it.\r\n\r\nMy friend, after a month's residence in this city, returned into France,\r\nand, since that period, had heard nothing concerning Carwin till his\r\nappearance at Mettingen.\r\n\r\nOn this occasion Carwin had received Pleyel's greeting with a certain\r\ndistance and solemnity to which the latter had not been accustomed. He\r\nhad waved noticing the inquiries of Pleyel respecting his desertion\r\nof Spain, in which he had formerly declared that it was his purpose to\r\nspend his life. He had assiduously diverted the attention of the latter\r\nto indifferent topics, but was still, on every theme, as eloquent and\r\njudicious as formerly. Why he had assumed the garb of a rustic, Pleyel\r\nwas unable to conjecture. Perhaps it might be poverty, perhaps he was\r\nswayed by motives which it was his interest to conceal, but which were\r\nconnected with consequences of the utmost moment.\r\n\r\nSuch was the sum of my friend's information. I was not sorry to be left\r\nalone during the greater part of this day. Every employment was irksome\r\nwhich did not leave me at liberty to meditate. I had now a new subject\r\non which to exercise my thoughts. Before evening I should be ushered\r\ninto his presence, and listen to those tones whose magical and thrilling\r\npower I had already experienced. But with what new images would he then\r\nbe accompanied?\r\n\r\nCarwin was an adherent to the Romish faith, yet was an Englishman by\r\nbirth, and, perhaps, a protestant by education. He had adopted Spain for\r\nhis country, and had intimated a design to spend his days there, yet now\r\nwas an inhabitant of this district, and disguised by the habiliments of\r\na clown! What could have obliterated the impressions of his youth, and\r\nmade him abjure his religion and his country? What subsequent events had\r\nintroduced so total a change in his plans? In withdrawing from Spain,\r\nhad he reverted to the religion of his ancestors; or was it true, that\r\nhis former conversion was deceitful, and that his conduct had been\r\nswayed by motives which it was prudent to conceal?\r\n\r\nHours were consumed in revolving these ideas. My meditations were\r\nintense; and, when the series was broken, I began to reflect with\r\nastonishment on my situation. From the death of my parents, till the\r\ncommencement of this year, my life had been serene and blissful, beyond\r\nthe ordinary portion of humanity; but, now, my bosom was corroded by\r\nanxiety. I was visited by dread of unknown dangers, and the future was\r\na scene over which clouds rolled, and thunders muttered. I compared the\r\ncause with the effect, and they seemed disproportioned to each other.\r\nAll unaware, and in a manner which I had no power to explain, I was\r\npushed from my immoveable and lofty station, and cast upon a sea of\r\ntroubles.\r\n\r\nI determined to be my brother's visitant on this evening, yet my\r\nresolves were not unattended with wavering and reluctance. Pleyel's\r\ninsinuations that I was in love, affected, in no degree, my belief, yet\r\nthe consciousness that this was the opinion of one who would, probably,\r\nbe present at our introduction to each other, would excite all that\r\nconfusion which the passion itself is apt to produce. This would confirm\r\nhim in his error, and call forth new railleries. His mirth, when exerted\r\nupon this topic, was the source of the bitterest vexation. Had he been\r\naware of its influence upon my happiness, his temper would not have\r\nallowed him to persist; but this influence, it was my chief endeavour\r\nto conceal. That the belief of my having bestowed my heart upon another,\r\nproduced in my friend none but ludicrous sensations, was the true cause\r\nof my distress; but if this had been discovered by him, my distress\r\nwould have been unspeakably aggravated.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter VIII\r\n\r\n\r\nAs soon as evening arrived, I performed my visit. Carwin made one of the\r\ncompany, into which I was ushered. Appearances were the same as when I\r\nbefore beheld him. His garb was equally negligent and rustic. I gazed\r\nupon his countenance with new curiosity. My situation was such as to\r\nenable me to bestow upon it a deliberate examination. Viewed at more\r\nleisure, it lost none of its wonderful properties. I could not deny my\r\nhomage to the intelligence expressed in it, but was wholly uncertain,\r\nwhether he were an object to be dreaded or adored, and whether his\r\npowers had been exerted to evil or to good.\r\n\r\nHe was sparing in discourse; but whatever he said was pregnant with\r\nmeaning, and uttered with rectitude of articulation, and force of\r\nemphasis, of which I had entertained no conception previously to my\r\nknowledge of him. Notwithstanding the uncouthness of his garb, his\r\nmanners were not unpolished. All topics were handled by him with skill,\r\nand without pedantry or affectation. He uttered no sentiment calculated\r\nto produce a disadvantageous impression: on the contrary, his\r\nobservations denoted a mind alive to every generous and heroic feeling.\r\nThey were introduced without parade, and accompanied with that degree of\r\nearnestness which indicates sincerity.\r\n\r\nHe parted from us not till late, refusing an invitation to spend the\r\nnight here, but readily consented to repeat his visit. His visits\r\nwere frequently repeated. Each day introduced us to a more intimate\r\nacquaintance with his sentiments, but left us wholly in the dark,\r\nconcerning that about which we were most inquisitive. He studiously\r\navoided all mention of his past or present situation. Even the place of\r\nhis abode in the city he concealed from us.\r\n\r\nOur sphere, in this respect, being somewhat limited, and the\r\nintellectual endowments of this man being indisputably great, his\r\ndeportment was more diligently marked, and copiously commented on by\r\nus, than you, perhaps, will think the circumstances warranted. Not a\r\ngesture, or glance, or accent, that was not, in our private assemblies,\r\ndiscussed, and inferences deduced from it. It may well be thought that\r\nhe modelled his behaviour by an uncommon standard, when, with all our\r\nopportunities and accuracy of observation, we were able, for a long\r\ntime, to gather no satisfactory information. He afforded us no ground on\r\nwhich to build even a plausible conjecture.\r\n\r\nThere is a degree of familiarity which takes place between constant\r\nassociates, that justifies the negligence of many rules of which, in\r\nan earlier period of their intercourse, politeness requires the exact\r\nobservance. Inquiries into our condition are allowable when they are\r\nprompted by a disinterested concern for our welfare; and this solicitude\r\nis not only pardonable, but may justly be demanded from those who chuse\r\nus for their companions. This state of things was more slow to arrive\r\non this occasion than on most others, on account of the gravity and\r\nloftiness of this man's behaviour.\r\n\r\nPleyel, however, began, at length, to employ regular means for this end.\r\nHe occasionally alluded to the circumstances in which they had formerly\r\nmet, and remarked the incongruousness between the religion and habits\r\nof a Spaniard, with those of a native of Britain. He expressed\r\nhis astonishment at meeting our guest in this corner of the globe,\r\nespecially as, when they parted in Spain, he was taught to believe that\r\nCarwin should never leave that country. He insinuated, that a change\r\nso great must have been prompted by motives of a singular and momentous\r\nkind.\r\n\r\nNo answer, or an answer wide of the purpose, was generally made to these\r\ninsinuations. Britons and Spaniards, he said, are votaries of the same\r\nDeity, and square their faith by the same precepts; their ideas are\r\ndrawn from the same fountains of literature, and they speak dialects of\r\nthe same tongue; their government and laws have more resemblances than\r\ndifferences; they were formerly provinces of the same civil, and till\r\nlately, of the same religious, Empire.\r\n\r\nAs to the motives which induce men to change the place of their abode,\r\nthese must unavoidably be fleeting and mutable. If not bound to one spot\r\nby conjugal or parental ties, or by the nature of that employment to\r\nwhich we are indebted for subsistence, the inducements to change are far\r\nmore numerous and powerful, than opposite inducements.\r\n\r\nHe spoke as if desirous of shewing that he was not aware of the tendency\r\nof Pleyel's remarks; yet, certain tokens were apparent, that proved him\r\nby no means wanting in penetration. These tokens were to be read in his\r\ncountenance, and not in his words. When any thing was said, indicating\r\ncuriosity in us, the gloom of his countenance was deepened, his eyes\r\nsunk to the ground, and his wonted air was not resumed without visible\r\nstruggle. Hence, it was obvious to infer, that some incidents of\r\nhis life were reflected on by him with regret; and that, since these\r\nincidents were carefully concealed, and even that regret which flowed\r\nfrom them laboriously stifled, they had not been merely disastrous. The\r\nsecrecy that was observed appeared not designed to provoke or baffle the\r\ninquisitive, but was prompted by the shame, or by the prudence of guilt.\r\n\r\nThese ideas, which were adopted by Pleyel and my brother, as well as\r\nmyself, hindered us from employing more direct means for accomplishing\r\nour wishes. Questions might have been put in such terms, that no room\r\nshould be left for the pretence of misapprehension, and if modesty\r\nmerely had been the obstacle, such questions would not have been\r\nwanting; but we considered, that, if the disclosure were productive of\r\npain or disgrace, it was inhuman to extort it.\r\n\r\nAmidst the various topics that were discussed in his presence, allusions\r\nwere, of course, made to the inexplicable events that had lately\r\nhappened. At those times, the words and looks of this man were objects\r\nof my particular attention. The subject was extraordinary; and any\r\none whose experience or reflections could throw any light upon it, was\r\nentitled to my gratitude. As this man was enlightened by reading and\r\ntravel, I listened with eagerness to the remarks which he should make.\r\n\r\nAt first, I entertained a kind of apprehension, that the tale would be\r\nheard by him with incredulity and secret ridicule. I had formerly heard\r\nstories that resembled this in some of their mysterious circumstances,\r\nbut they were, commonly, heard by me with contempt. I was doubtful,\r\nwhether the same impression would not now be made on the mind of our\r\nguest; but I was mistaken in my fears.\r\n\r\nHe heard them with seriousness, and without any marks either of\r\nsurprize or incredulity. He pursued, with visible pleasure, that kind\r\nof disquisition which was naturally suggested by them. His fancy was\r\neminently vigorous and prolific, and if he did not persuade us, that\r\nhuman beings are, sometimes, admitted to a sensible intercourse with the\r\nauthor of nature, he, at least, won over our inclination to the cause.\r\nHe merely deduced, from his own reasonings, that such intercourse\r\nwas probable; but confessed that, though he was acquainted with many\r\ninstances somewhat similar to those which had been related by us, none\r\nof them were perfectly exempted from the suspicion of human agency.\r\n\r\nOn being requested to relate these instances, he amused us with many\r\ncurious details. His narratives were constructed with so much skill,\r\nand rehearsed with so much energy, that all the effects of a dramatic\r\nexhibition were frequently produced by them. Those that were most\r\ncoherent and most minute, and, of consequence, least entitled to credit,\r\nwere yet rendered probable by the exquisite art of this rhetorician. For\r\nevery difficulty that was suggested, a ready and plausible solution\r\nwas furnished. Mysterious voices had always a share in producing\r\nthe catastrophe, but they were always to be explained on some known\r\nprinciples, either as reflected into a focus, or communicated through\r\na tube. I could not but remark that his narratives, however complex or\r\nmarvellous, contained no instance sufficiently parallel to those that\r\nhad befallen ourselves, and in which the solution was applicable to our\r\nown case.\r\n\r\nMy brother was a much more sanguine reasoner than our guest. Even\r\nin some of the facts which were related by Carwin, he maintained the\r\nprobability of celestial interference, when the latter was disposed to\r\ndeny it, and had found, as he imagined, footsteps of an human agent.\r\nPleyel was by no means equally credulous. He scrupled not to deny faith\r\nto any testimony but that of his senses, and allowed the facts which had\r\nlately been supported by this testimony, not to mould his belief, but\r\nmerely to give birth to doubts.\r\n\r\nIt was soon observed that Carwin adopted, in some degree, a similar\r\ndistinction. A tale of this kind, related by others, he would believe,\r\nprovided it was explicable upon known principles; but that such notices\r\nwere actually communicated by beings of an higher order, he would\r\nbelieve only when his own ears were assailed in a manner which could not\r\nbe otherwise accounted for. Civility forbad him to contradict my brother\r\nor myself, but his understanding refused to acquiesce in our testimony.\r\nBesides, he was disposed to question whether the voices heard in the\r\ntemple, at the foot of the hill, and in my closet, were not really\r\nuttered by human organs. On this supposition he was desired to explain\r\nhow the effect was produced.\r\n\r\nHe answered, that the power of mimickry was very common. Catharine's\r\nvoice might easily be imitated by one at the foot of the hill, who would\r\nfind no difficulty in eluding, by flight, the search of Wieland. The\r\ntidings of the death of the Saxon lady were uttered by one near at hand,\r\nwho overheard the conversation, who conjectured her death, and whose\r\nconjecture happened to accord with the truth. That the voice appeared to\r\ncome from the cieling was to be considered as an illusion of the fancy.\r\nThe cry for help, heard in the hall on the night of my adventure, was to\r\nbe ascribed to an human creature, who actually stood in the hall when he\r\nuttered it. It was of no moment, he said, that we could not explain by\r\nwhat motives he that made the signal was led hither. How imperfectly\r\nacquainted were we with the condition and designs of the beings that\r\nsurrounded us? The city was near at hand, and thousands might there\r\nexist whose powers and purposes might easily explain whatever was\r\nmysterious in this transaction. As to the closet dialogue, he was\r\nobliged to adopt one of two suppositions, and affirm either that it was\r\nfashioned in my own fancy, or that it actually took place between two\r\npersons in the closet.\r\n\r\nSuch was Carwin's mode of explaining these appearances. It is such,\r\nperhaps, as would commend itself as most plausible to the most sagacious\r\nminds, but it was insufficient to impart conviction to us. As to the\r\ntreason that was meditated against me, it was doubtless just to conclude\r\nthat it was either real or imaginary; but that it was real was attested\r\nby the mysterious warning in the summer-house, the secret of which I had\r\nhitherto locked up in my own breast.\r\n\r\nA month passed away in this kind of intercourse. As to Carwin, our\r\nignorance was in no degree enlightened respecting his genuine character\r\nand views. Appearances were uniform. No man possessed a larger store of\r\nknowledge, or a greater degree of skill in the communication of it to\r\nothers; Hence he was regarded as an inestimable addition to our society.\r\nConsidering the distance of my brother's house from the city, he was\r\nfrequently prevailed upon to pass the night where he spent the evening.\r\nTwo days seldom elapsed without a visit from him; hence he was regarded\r\nas a kind of inmate of the house. He entered and departed without\r\nceremony. When he arrived he received an unaffected welcome, and when he\r\nchose to retire, no importunities were used to induce him to remain.\r\n\r\nThe temple was the principal scene of our social enjoyments; yet the\r\nfelicity that we tasted when assembled in this asylum, was but the\r\ngleam of a former sun-shine. Carwin never parted with his gravity.\r\nThe inscrutableness of his character, and the uncertainty whether his\r\nfellowship tended to good or to evil, were seldom absent from our minds.\r\nThis circumstance powerfully contributed to sadden us.\r\n\r\nMy heart was the seat of growing disquietudes. This change in one who\r\nhad formerly been characterized by all the exuberances of soul, could\r\nnot fail to be remarked by my friends. My brother was always a pattern\r\nof solemnity. My sister was clay, moulded by the circumstances in which\r\nshe happened to be placed. There was but one whose deportment remains\r\nto be described as being of importance to our happiness. Had Pleyel\r\nlikewise dismissed his vivacity?\r\n\r\nHe was as whimsical and jestful as ever, but he was not happy. The\r\ntruth, in this respect, was of too much importance to me not to make me\r\na vigilant observer. His mirth was easily perceived to be the fruit\r\nof exertion. When his thoughts wandered from the company, an air of\r\ndissatisfaction and impatience stole across his features. Even the\r\npunctuality and frequency of his visits were somewhat lessened. It may\r\nbe supposed that my own uneasiness was heightened by these tokens; but,\r\nstrange as it may seem, I found, in the present state of my mind, no\r\nrelief but in the persuasion that Pleyel was unhappy.\r\n\r\nThat unhappiness, indeed, depended, for its value in my eyes, on the\r\ncause that produced it. It did not arise from the death of the Saxon\r\nlady: it was not a contagious emanation from the countenances of Wieland\r\nor Carwin. There was but one other source whence it could flow. A\r\nnameless ecstacy thrilled through my frame when any new proof occurred\r\nthat the ambiguousness of my behaviour was the cause.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter IX\r\n\r\n\r\nMy brother had received a new book from Germany. It was a tragedy, and\r\nthe first attempt of a Saxon poet, of whom my brother had been taught to\r\nentertain the highest expectations. The exploits of Zisca, the Bohemian\r\nhero, were woven into a dramatic series and connection. According to\r\nGerman custom, it was minute and diffuse, and dictated by an adventurous\r\nand lawless fancy. It was a chain of audacious acts, and unheard-of\r\ndisasters. The moated fortress, and the thicket; the ambush and the\r\nbattle; and the conflict of headlong passions, were pourtrayed in\r\nwild numbers, and with terrific energy. An afternoon was set apart to\r\nrehearse this performance. The language was familiar to all of us but\r\nCarwin, whose company, therefore, was tacitly dispensed with.\r\n\r\nThe morning previous to this intended rehearsal, I spent at home. My\r\nmind was occupied with reflections relative to my own situation. The\r\nsentiment which lived with chief energy in my heart, was connected\r\nwith the image of Pleyel. In the midst of my anguish, I had not been\r\ndestitute of consolation. His late deportment had given spring to my\r\nhopes. Was not the hour at hand, which should render me the happiest\r\nof human creatures? He suspected that I looked with favorable eyes upon\r\nCarwin. Hence arose disquietudes, which he struggled in vain to conceal.\r\nHe loved me, but was hopeless that his love would be compensated. Is it\r\nnot time, said I, to rectify this error? But by what means is this to be\r\neffected? It can only be done by a change of deportment in me; but how\r\nmust I demean myself for this purpose?\r\n\r\nI must not speak. Neither eyes, nor lips, must impart the information.\r\nHe must not be assured that my heart is his, previous to the tender of\r\nhis own; but he must be convinced that it has not been given to another;\r\nhe must be supplied with space whereon to build a doubt as to the true\r\nstate of my affections; he must be prompted to avow himself. The line\r\nof delicate propriety; how hard it is, not to fall short, and not to\r\noverleap it!\r\n\r\nThis afternoon we shall meet at the temple. We shall not separate till\r\nlate. It will be his province to accompany me home. The airy expanse is\r\nwithout a speck. This breeze is usually stedfast, and its promise of\r\na bland and cloudless evening, may be trusted. The moon will rise at\r\neleven, and at that hour, we shall wind along this bank. Possibly that\r\nhour may decide my fate. If suitable encouragement be given, Pleyel will\r\nreveal his soul to me; and I, ere I reach this threshold, will be made\r\nthe happiest of beings. And is this good to be mine? Add wings to thy\r\nspeed, sweet evening; and thou, moon, I charge thee, shroud thy beams at\r\nthe moment when my Pleyel whispers love. I would not for the world, that\r\nthe burning blushes, and the mounting raptures of that moment, should be\r\nvisible.\r\n\r\nBut what encouragement is wanting? I must be regardful of insurmountable\r\nlimits. Yet when minds are imbued with a genuine sympathy, are not words\r\nand looks superfluous? Are not motion and touch sufficient to impart\r\nfeelings such as mine? Has he not eyed me at moments, when the pressure\r\nof his hand has thrown me into tumults, and was it possible that he\r\nmistook the impetuosities of love, for the eloquence of indignation?\r\n\r\nBut the hastening evening will decide. Would it were come! And yet I\r\nshudder at its near approach. An interview that must thus terminate, is\r\nsurely to be wished for by me; and yet it is not without its terrors.\r\nWould to heaven it were come and gone!\r\n\r\nI feel no reluctance, my friends to be thus explicit. Time was, when\r\nthese emotions would be hidden with immeasurable solicitude, from every\r\nhuman eye. Alas! these airy and fleeting impulses of shame are gone. My\r\nscruples were preposterous and criminal. They are bred in all hearts, by\r\na perverse and vicious education, and they would still have maintained\r\ntheir place in my heart, had not my portion been set in misery. My\r\nerrors have taught me thus much wisdom; that those sentiments which we\r\nought not to disclose, it is criminal to harbour.\r\n\r\nIt was proposed to begin the rehearsal at four o'clock; I counted the\r\nminutes as they passed; their flight was at once too rapid and too slow;\r\nmy sensations were of an excruciating kind; I could taste no food, nor\r\napply to any task, nor enjoy a moment's repose: when the hour arrived, I\r\nhastened to my brother's.\r\n\r\nPleyel was not there. He had not yet come. On ordinary occasions, he was\r\neminent for punctuality. He had testified great eagerness to share\r\nin the pleasures of this rehearsal. He was to divide the task with my\r\nbrother, and, in tasks like these, he always engaged with peculiar\r\nzeal. His elocution was less sweet than sonorous; and, therefore,\r\nbetter adapted than the mellifluences of his friend, to the outrageous\r\nvehemence of this drama.\r\n\r\nWhat could detain him? Perhaps he lingered through forgetfulness. Yet\r\nthis was incredible. Never had his memory been known to fail upon even\r\nmore trivial occasions. Not less impossible was it, that the scheme had\r\nlost its attractions, and that he staid, because his coming would afford\r\nhim no gratification. But why should we expect him to adhere to the\r\nminute?\r\n\r\nAn half hour elapsed, but Pleyel was still at a distance. Perhaps he had\r\nmisunderstood the hour which had been proposed. Perhaps he had conceived\r\nthat to-morrow, and not to-day, had been selected for this purpose:\r\nbut no. A review of preceding circumstances demonstrated that such\r\nmisapprehension was impossible; for he had himself proposed this day,\r\nand this hour. This day, his attention would not otherwise be occupied;\r\nbut to-morrow, an indispensible engagement was foreseen, by which all\r\nhis time would be engrossed: his detention, therefore, must be owing\r\nto some unforeseen and extraordinary event. Our conjectures were vague,\r\ntumultuous, and sometimes fearful. His sickness and his death might\r\npossibly have detained him.\r\n\r\nTortured with suspense, we sat gazing at each other, and at the path\r\nwhich led from the road. Every horseman that passed was, for a moment,\r\nimagined to be him. Hour succeeded hour, and the sun, gradually\r\ndeclining, at length, disappeared. Every signal of his coming proved\r\nfallacious, and our hopes were at length dismissed. His absence affected\r\nmy friends in no insupportable degree. They should be obliged, they\r\nsaid, to defer this undertaking till the morrow; and, perhaps, their\r\nimpatient curiosity would compel them to dispense entirely with his\r\npresence. No doubt, some harmless occurrence had diverted him from\r\nhis purpose; and they trusted that they should receive a satisfactory\r\naccount of him in the morning.\r\n\r\nIt may be supposed that this disappointment affected me in a very\r\ndifferent manner. I turned aside my head to conceal my tears. I fled\r\ninto solitude, to give vent to my reproaches, without interruption\r\nor restraint. My heart was ready to burst with indignation and grief.\r\nPleyel was not the only object of my keen but unjust upbraiding. Deeply\r\ndid I execrate my own folly. Thus fallen into ruins was the gay fabric\r\nwhich I had reared! Thus had my golden vision melted into air!\r\n\r\nHow fondly did I dream that Pleyel was a lover! If he were, would he\r\nhave suffered any obstacle to hinder his coming? Blind and infatuated\r\nman! I exclaimed. Thou sportest with happiness. The good that is\r\noffered thee, thou hast the insolence and folly to refuse. Well, I will\r\nhenceforth intrust my felicity to no one's keeping but my own.\r\n\r\nThe first agonies of this disappointment would not allow me to be\r\nreasonable or just. Every ground on which I had built the persuasion\r\nthat Pleyel was not unimpressed in my favor, appeared to vanish. It\r\nseemed as if I had been misled into this opinion, by the most palpable\r\nillusions.\r\n\r\nI made some trifling excuse, and returned, much earlier than I expected,\r\nto my own house. I retired early to my chamber, without designing to\r\nsleep. I placed myself at a window, and gave the reins to reflection.\r\n\r\nThe hateful and degrading impulses which had lately controuled me were,\r\nin some degree, removed. New dejection succeeded, but was now produced\r\nby contemplating my late behaviour. Surely that passion is worthy to\r\nbe abhorred which obscures our understanding, and urges us to the\r\ncommission of injustice. What right had I to expect his attendance?\r\nHad I not demeaned myself like one indifferent to his happiness, and as\r\nhaving bestowed my regards upon another? His absence might be prompted\r\nby the love which I considered his absence as a proof that he wanted.\r\nHe came not because the sight of me, the spectacle of my coldness or\r\naversion, contributed to his despair. Why should I prolong, by hypocrisy\r\nor silence, his misery as well as my own? Why not deal with him\r\nexplicitly, and assure him of the truth?\r\n\r\nYou will hardly believe that, in obedience to this suggestion, I rose\r\nfor the purpose of ordering a light, that I might instantly make this\r\nconfession in a letter. A second thought shewed me the rashness of this\r\nscheme, and I wondered by what infirmity of mind I could be betrayed\r\ninto a momentary approbation of it. I saw with the utmost clearness that\r\na confession like that would be the most remediless and unpardonable\r\noutrage upon the dignity of my sex, and utterly unworthy of that passion\r\nwhich controuled me.\r\n\r\nI resumed my seat and my musing. To account for the absence of Pleyel\r\nbecame once more the scope of my conjectures. How many incidents might\r\noccur to raise an insuperable impediment in his way? When I was a child,\r\na scheme of pleasure, in which he and his sister were parties, had been,\r\nin like manner, frustrated by his absence; but his absence, in that\r\ninstance, had been occasioned by his falling from a boat into the river,\r\nin consequence of which he had run the most imminent hazard of being\r\ndrowned. Here was a second disappointment endured by the same persons,\r\nand produced by his failure. Might it not originate in the same cause?\r\nHad he not designed to cross the river that morning to make some\r\nnecessary purchases in Jersey? He had preconcerted to return to his\r\nown house to dinner; but, perhaps, some disaster had befallen him.\r\nExperience had taught me the insecurity of a canoe, and that was the\r\nonly kind of boat which Pleyel used: I was, likewise, actuated by\r\nan hereditary dread of water. These circumstances combined to bestow\r\nconsiderable plausibility on this conjecture; but the consternation\r\nwith which I began to be seized was allayed by reflecting, that if\r\nthis disaster had happened my brother would have received the speediest\r\ninformation of it. The consolation which this idea imparted was ravished\r\nfrom me by a new thought. This disaster might have happened, and his\r\nfamily not be apprized of it. The first intelligence of his fate may\r\nbe communicated by the livid corpse which the tide may cast, many days\r\nhence, upon the shore.\r\n\r\nThus was I distressed by opposite conjectures: thus was I tormented by\r\nphantoms of my own creation. It was not always thus. I can ascertain the\r\ndate when my mind became the victim of this imbecility; perhaps it was\r\ncoeval with the inroad of a fatal passion; a passion that will never\r\nrank me in the number of its eulogists; it was alone sufficient to the\r\nextermination of my peace: it was itself a plenteous source of\r\ncalamity, and needed not the concurrence of other evils to take away the\r\nattractions of existence, and dig for me an untimely grave.\r\n\r\nThe state of my mind naturally introduced a train of reflections upon\r\nthe dangers and cares which inevitably beset an human being. By no\r\nviolent transition was I led to ponder on the turbulent life and\r\nmysterious end of my father. I cherished, with the utmost veneration,\r\nthe memory of this man, and every relique connected with his fate was\r\npreserved with the most scrupulous care. Among these was to be numbered\r\na manuscript, containing memoirs of his own life. The narrative was by\r\nno means recommended by its eloquence; but neither did all its value\r\nflow from my relationship to the author. Its stile had an unaffected and\r\npicturesque simplicity. The great variety and circumstantial display of\r\nthe incidents, together with their intrinsic importance, as descriptive\r\nof human manners and passions, made it the most useful book in my\r\ncollection. It was late; but being sensible of no inclination to sleep,\r\nI resolved to betake myself to the perusal of it.\r\n\r\nTo do this it was requisite to procure a light. The girl had long since\r\nretired to her chamber: it was therefore proper to wait upon myself.\r\nA lamp, and the means of lighting it, were only to be found in the\r\nkitchen. Thither I resolved forthwith to repair; but the light was of\r\nuse merely to enable me to read the book. I knew the shelf and the spot\r\nwhere it stood. Whether I took down the book, or prepared the lamp in\r\nthe first place, appeared to be a matter of no moment. The latter was\r\npreferred, and, leaving my seat, I approached the closet in which, as I\r\nmentioned formerly, my books and papers were deposited.\r\n\r\nSuddenly the remembrance of what had lately passed in this closet\r\noccurred. Whether midnight was approaching, or had passed, I knew not. I\r\nwas, as then, alone, and defenceless. The wind was in that direction\r\nin which, aided by the deathlike repose of nature, it brought to me\r\nthe murmur of the water-fall. This was mingled with that solemn and\r\nenchanting sound, which a breeze produces among the leaves of pines. The\r\nwords of that mysterious dialogue, their fearful import, and the wild\r\nexcess to which I was transported by my terrors, filled my imagination\r\nanew. My steps faultered, and I stood a moment to recover myself.\r\n\r\nI prevailed on myself at length to move towards the closet. I touched\r\nthe lock, but my fingers were powerless; I was visited afresh by\r\nunconquerable apprehensions. A sort of belief darted into my mind, that\r\nsome being was concealed within, whose purposes were evil. I began to\r\ncontend with those fears, when it occurred to me that I might, without\r\nimpropriety, go for a lamp previously to opening the closet. I receded\r\na few steps; but before I reached my chamber door my thoughts took a new\r\ndirection. Motion seemed to produce a mechanical influence upon me. I\r\nwas ashamed of my weakness. Besides, what aid could be afforded me by a\r\nlamp?\r\n\r\nMy fears had pictured to themselves no precise object. It would be\r\ndifficult to depict, in words, the ingredients and hues of that phantom\r\nwhich haunted me. An hand invisible and of preternatural strength,\r\nlifted by human passions, and selecting my life for its aim, were parts\r\nof this terrific image. All places were alike accessible to this foe, or\r\nif his empire were restricted by local bounds, those bounds were utterly\r\ninscrutable by me. But had I not been told by some one in league with\r\nthis enemy, that every place but the recess in the bank was exempt from\r\ndanger? I returned to the closet, and once more put my hand upon the\r\nlock. O! may my ears lose their sensibility, ere they be again assailed\r\nby a shriek so terrible! Not merely my understanding was subdued by the\r\nsound: it acted on my nerves like an edge of steel. It appeared to cut\r\nasunder the fibres of my brain, and rack every joint with agony.\r\n\r\nThe cry, loud and piercing as it was, was nevertheless human. No\r\narticulation was ever more distinct. The breath which accompanied it did\r\nnot fan my hair, yet did every circumstance combine to persuade me that\r\nthe lips which uttered it touched my very shoulder.\r\n\r\n\"Hold! Hold!\" were the words of this tremendous prohibition, in whose\r\ntone the whole soul seemed to be wrapped up, and every energy converted\r\ninto eagerness and terror.\r\n\r\nShuddering, I dashed myself against the wall, and by the same\r\ninvoluntary impulse, turned my face backward to examine the mysterious\r\nmonitor. The moon-light streamed into each window, and every corner of\r\nthe room was conspicuous, and yet I beheld nothing!\r\n\r\nThe interval was too brief to be artificially measured, between the\r\nutterance of these words, and my scrutiny directed to the quarter whence\r\nthey came. Yet if a human being had been there, could he fail to have\r\nbeen visible? Which of my senses was the prey of a fatal illusion? The\r\nshock which the sound produced was still felt in every part of my frame.\r\nThe sound, therefore, could not but be a genuine commotion. But that I\r\nhad heard it, was not more true than that the being who uttered it was\r\nstationed at my right ear; yet my attendant was invisible.\r\n\r\nI cannot describe the state of my thoughts at that moment. Surprize\r\nhad mastered my faculties. My frame shook, and the vital current was\r\ncongealed. I was conscious only to the vehemence of my sensations. This\r\ncondition could not be lasting. Like a tide, which suddenly mounts to\r\nan overwhelming height, and then gradually subsides, my confusion slowly\r\ngave place to order, and my tumults to a calm. I was able to deliberate\r\nand move. I resumed my feet, and advanced into the midst of the room.\r\nUpward, and behind, and on each side, I threw penetrating glances. I was\r\nnot satisfied with one examination. He that hitherto refused to be\r\nseen, might change his purpose, and on the next survey be clearly\r\ndistinguishable.\r\n\r\nSolitude imposes least restraint upon the fancy. Dark is less fertile\r\nof images than the feeble lustre of the moon. I was alone, and the walls\r\nwere chequered by shadowy forms. As the moon passed behind a cloud and\r\nemerged, these shadows seemed to be endowed with life, and to move. The\r\napartment was open to the breeze, and the curtain was occasionally\r\nblown from its ordinary position. This motion was not unaccompanied with\r\nsound. I failed not to snatch a look, and to listen when this motion\r\nand this sound occurred. My belief that my monitor was posted near,\r\nwas strong, and instantly converted these appearances to tokens of his\r\npresence, and yet I could discern nothing.\r\n\r\nWhen my thoughts were at length permitted to revert to the past, the\r\nfirst idea that occurred was the resemblance between the words of the\r\nvoice which I had just heard, and those which had terminated my dream in\r\nthe summer-house. There are means by which we are able to distinguish a\r\nsubstance from a shadow, a reality from the phantom of a dream. The pit,\r\nmy brother beckoning me forward, the seizure of my arm, and the voice\r\nbehind, were surely imaginary. That these incidents were fashioned in my\r\nsleep, is supported by the same indubitable evidence that compels me to\r\nbelieve myself awake at present; yet the words and the voice were the\r\nsame. Then, by some inexplicable contrivance, I was aware of the danger,\r\nwhile my actions and sensations were those of one wholly unacquainted\r\nwith it. Now, was it not equally true that my actions and persuasions\r\nwere at war? Had not the belief, that evil lurked in the closet, gained\r\nadmittance, and had not my actions betokened an unwarrantable security?\r\nTo obviate the effects of my infatuation, the same means had been used.\r\n\r\nIn my dream, he that tempted me to my destruction, was my brother. Death\r\nwas ambushed in my path. From what evil was I now rescued? What minister\r\nor implement of ill was shut up in this recess? Who was it whose\r\nsuffocating grasp I was to feel, should I dare to enter it? What\r\nmonstrous conception is this? my brother!\r\n\r\nNo; protection, and not injury is his province. Strange and terrible\r\nchimera! Yet it would not be suddenly dismissed. It was surely no vulgar\r\nagency that gave this form to my fears. He to whom all parts of time are\r\nequally present, whom no contingency approaches, was the author of that\r\nspell which now seized upon me. Life was dear to me. No consideration\r\nwas present that enjoined me to relinquish it. Sacred duty combined\r\nwith every spontaneous sentiment to endear to me my being. Should I not\r\nshudder when my being was endangered? But what emotion should possess me\r\nwhen the arm lifted aginst me was Wieland's?\r\n\r\nIdeas exist in our minds that can be accounted for by no established\r\nlaws. Why did I dream that my brother was my foe? Why but because an\r\nomen of my fate was ordained to be communicated? Yet what salutary end\r\ndid it serve? Did it arm me with caution to elude, or fortitude to bear\r\nthe evils to which I was reserved? My present thoughts were, no\r\ndoubt, indebted for their hue to the similitude existing between these\r\nincidents and those of my dream. Surely it was phrenzy that dictated my\r\ndeed. That a ruffian was hidden in the closet, was an idea, the genuine\r\ntendency of which was to urge me to flight. Such had been the effect\r\nformerly produced. Had my mind been simply occupied with this thought at\r\npresent, no doubt, the same impulse would have been experienced; but\r\nnow it was my brother whom I was irresistably persuaded to regard as the\r\ncontriver of that ill of which I had been forewarned. This persuasion\r\ndid not extenuate my fears or my danger. Why then did I again approach\r\nthe closet and withdraw the bolt? My resolution was instantly conceived,\r\nand executed without faultering.\r\n\r\nThe door was formed of light materials. The lock, of simple structure,\r\neasily forewent its hold. It opened into the room, and commonly moved\r\nupon its hinges, after being unfastened, without any effort of mine.\r\nThis effort, however, was bestowed upon the present occasion. It was\r\nmy purpose to open it with quickness, but the exertion which I made was\r\nineffectual. It refused to open.\r\n\r\nAt another time, this circumstance would not have looked with a face of\r\nmystery. I should have supposed some casual obstruction, and repeated my\r\nefforts to surmount it. But now my mind was accessible to no conjecture\r\nbut one. The door was hindered from opening by human force. Surely, here\r\nwas new cause for affright. This was confirmation proper to decide my\r\nconduct. Now was all ground of hesitation taken away. What could be\r\nsupposed but that I deserted the chamber and the house? that I at least\r\nendeavoured no longer to withdraw the door?\r\n\r\nHave I not said that my actions were dictated by phrenzy? My reason had\r\nforborne, for a time, to suggest or to sway my resolves. I reiterated\r\nmy endeavours. I exerted all my force to overcome the obstacle, but in\r\nvain. The strength that was exerted to keep it shut, was superior to\r\nmine.\r\n\r\nA casual observer might, perhaps, applaud the audaciousness of this\r\nconduct. Whence, but from an habitual defiance of danger, could my\r\nperseverance arise? I have already assigned, as distinctly as I am able,\r\nthe cause of it. The frantic conception that my brother was within, that\r\nthe resistance made to my design was exerted by him, had rooted itself\r\nin my mind. You will comprehend the height of this infatuation, when\r\nI tell you, that, finding all my exertions vain, I betook myself to\r\nexclamations. Surely I was utterly bereft of understanding.\r\n\r\nNow had I arrived at the crisis of my fate. \"O! hinder not the door to\r\nopen,\" I exclaimed, in a tone that had less of fear than of grief in\r\nit. \"I know you well. Come forth, but harm me not. I beseech you come\r\nforth.\"\r\n\r\nI had taken my hand from the lock, and removed to a small distance from\r\nthe door. I had scarcely uttered these words, when the door swung upon\r\nits hinges, and displayed to my view the interior of the closet. Whoever\r\nwas within, was shrouded in darkness. A few seconds passed without\r\ninterruption of the silence. I knew not what to expect or to fear. My\r\neyes would not stray from the recess. Presently, a deep sigh was heard.\r\nThe quarter from which it came heightened the eagerness of my gaze. Some\r\none approached from the farther end. I quickly perceived the outlines\r\nof a human figure. Its steps were irresolute and slow. I recoiled as it\r\nadvanced.\r\n\r\nBy coming at length within the verge of the room, his form was clearly\r\ndistinguishable. I had prefigured to myself a very different personage.\r\nThe face that presented itself was the last that I should desire to meet\r\nat an hour, and in a place like this. My wonder was stifled by my fears.\r\nAssassins had lurked in this recess. Some divine voice warned me of\r\ndanger, that at this moment awaited me. I had spurned the intimation,\r\nand challenged my adversary.\r\n\r\nI recalled the mysterious countenance and dubious character of Carwin.\r\nWhat motive but atrocious ones could guide his steps hither? I was\r\nalone. My habit suited the hour, and the place, and the warmth of the\r\nseason. All succour was remote. He had placed himself between me and the\r\ndoor. My frame shook with the vehemence of my apprehensions.\r\n\r\nYet I was not wholly lost to myself: I vigilantly marked his demeanour.\r\nHis looks were grave, but not without perturbation. What species of\r\ninquietude it betrayed, the light was not strong enough to enable me\r\nto discover. He stood still; but his eyes wandered from one object to\r\nanother. When these powerful organs were fixed upon me, I shrunk into\r\nmyself. At length, he broke silence. Earnestness, and not embarrassment,\r\nwas in his tone. He advanced close to me while he spoke.\r\n\r\n\"What voice was that which lately addressed you?\"\r\n\r\nHe paused for an answer; but observing my trepidation, he resumed, with\r\nundiminished solemnity: \"Be not terrified. Whoever he was, he hast done\r\nyou an important service. I need not ask you if it were the voice of\r\na companion. That sound was beyond the compass of human organs. The\r\nknowledge that enabled him to tell you who was in the closet, was\r\nobtained by incomprehensible means.\r\n\r\n\"You knew that Carwin was there. Were you not apprized of his intents?\r\nThe same power could impart the one as well as the other. Yet, knowing\r\nthese, you persisted. Audacious girl! but, perhaps, you confided in his\r\nguardianship. Your confidence was just. With succour like this at hand\r\nyou may safely defy me.\r\n\r\n\"He is my eternal foe; the baffler of my best concerted schemes. Twice\r\nhave you been saved by his accursed interposition. But for him I should\r\nlong ere now have borne away the spoils of your honor.\"\r\n\r\nHe looked at me with greater stedfastness than before. I became every\r\nmoment more anxious for my safety. It was with difficulty I stammered\r\nout an entreaty that he would instantly depart, or suffer me to do so.\r\nHe paid no regard to my request, but proceeded in a more impassioned\r\nmanner.\r\n\r\n\"What is it you fear? Have I not told you, you are safe? Has not one\r\nin whom you more reasonably place trust assured you of it? Even if I\r\nexecute my purpose, what injury is done? Your prejudices will call it\r\nby that name, but it merits it not. I was impelled by a sentiment that\r\ndoes you honor; a sentiment, that would sanctify my deed; but, whatever\r\nit be, you are safe. Be this chimera still worshipped; I will do nothing\r\nto pollute it.\" There he stopped.\r\n\r\nThe accents and gestures of this man left me drained of all courage.\r\nSurely, on no other occasion should I have been thus pusillanimous. My\r\nstate I regarded as a hopeless one. I was wholly at the mercy of this\r\nbeing. Whichever way I turned my eyes, I saw no avenue by which I might\r\nescape. The resources of my personal strength, my ingenuity, and my\r\neloquence, I estimated at nothing. The dignity of virtue, and the force\r\nof truth, I had been accustomed to celebrate; and had frequently vaunted\r\nof the conquests which I should make with their assistance.\r\n\r\nI used to suppose that certain evils could never befall a being in\r\npossession of a sound mind; that true virtue supplies us with energy\r\nwhich vice can never resist; that it was always in our power to\r\nobstruct, by his own death, the designs of an enemy who aimed at less\r\nthan our life. How was it that a sentiment like despair had now invaded\r\nme, and that I trusted to the protection of chance, or to the pity of my\r\npersecutor?\r\n\r\nHis words imparted some notion of the injury which he had meditated. He\r\ntalked of obstacles that had risen in his way. He had relinquished his\r\ndesign. These sources supplied me with slender consolation. There was no\r\nsecurity but in his absence. When I looked at myself, when I reflected\r\non the hour and the place, I was overpowered by horror and dejection.\r\n\r\nHe was silent, museful, and inattentive to my situation, yet made no\r\nmotion to depart. I was silent in my turn. What could I say? I was\r\nconfident that reason in this contest would be impotent. I must owe my\r\nsafety to his own suggestions. Whatever purpose brought him hither, he\r\nhad changed it. Why then did he remain? His resolutions might fluctuate,\r\nand the pause of a few minutes restore to him his first resolutions.\r\n\r\nYet was not this the man whom we had treated with unwearied kindness?\r\nWhose society was endeared to us by his intellectual elevation and\r\naccomplishments? Who had a thousand times expatiated on the usefulness\r\nand beauty of virtue? Why should such a one be dreaded? If I could have\r\nforgotten the circumstances in which our interview had taken place, I\r\nmight have treated his words as jests. Presently, he resumed:\r\n\r\n\"Fear me not: the space that severs us is small, and all visible succour\r\nis distant. You believe yourself completely in my power; that you stand\r\nupon the brink of ruin. Such are your groundless fears. I cannot lift\r\na finger to hurt you. Easier it would be to stop the moon in her course\r\nthan to injure you. The power that protects you would crumble my sinews,\r\nand reduce me to a heap of ashes in a moment, if I were to harbour a\r\nthought hostile to your safety. Thus are appearances at length solved.\r\nLittle did I expect that they originated hence. What a portion is\r\nassigned to you? Scanned by the eyes of this intelligence, your path\r\nwill be without pits to swallow, or snares to entangle you. Environed by\r\nthe arms of this protection, all artifices will be frustrated, and all\r\nmalice repelled.\"\r\n\r\nHere succeeded a new pause. I was still observant of every gesture and\r\nlook. The tranquil solemnity that had lately possessed his countenance\r\ngave way to a new expression. All now was trepidation and anxiety.\r\n\r\n\"I must be gone,\" said he in a faltering accent. \"Why do I linger here?\r\nI will not ask your forgiveness. I see that your terrors are invincible.\r\nYour pardon will be extorted by fear, and not dictated by compassion. I\r\nmust fly from you forever. He that could plot against your honor, must\r\nexpect from you and your friends persecution and death. I must doom\r\nmyself to endless exile.\"\r\n\r\nSaying this, he hastily left the room. I listened while he descended the\r\nstairs, and, unbolting the outer door, went forth. I did not follow him\r\nwith my eyes, as the moon-light would have enabled me to do. Relieved by\r\nhis absence, and exhausted by the conflict of my fears, I threw myself\r\non a chair, and resigned myself to those bewildering ideas which\r\nincidents like these could not fail to produce.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter X\r\n\r\n\r\nOrder could not readily be introduced into my thoughts. The voice still\r\nrung in my ears. Every accent that was uttered by Carwin was fresh in my\r\nremembrance. His unwelcome approach, the recognition of his person, his\r\nhasty departure, produced a complex impression on my mind which no words\r\ncan delineate. I strove to give a slower motion to my thoughts, and to\r\nregulate a confusion which became painful; but my efforts were nugatory.\r\nI covered my eyes with my hand, and sat, I know not how long, without\r\npower to arrange or utter my conceptions.\r\n\r\nI had remained for hours, as I believed, in absolute solitude. No\r\nthought of personal danger had molested my tranquillity. I had made\r\nno preparation for defence. What was it that suggested the design of\r\nperusing my father's manuscript? If, instead of this, I had retired\r\nto bed, and to sleep, to what fate might I not have been reserved? The\r\nruffian, who must almost have suppressed his breathing to screen himself\r\nfrom discovery, would have noticed this signal, and I should have\r\nawakened only to perish with affright, and to abhor myself. Could I have\r\nremained unconscious of my danger? Could I have tranquilly slept in the\r\nmidst of so deadly a snare?\r\n\r\nAnd who was he that threatened to destroy me? By what means could he\r\nhide himself in this closet? Surely he is gifted with supernatural\r\npower. Such is the enemy of whose attempts I was forewarned. Daily I had\r\nseen him and conversed with him. Nothing could be discerned through the\r\nimpenetrable veil of his duplicity. When busied in conjectures, as to\r\nthe author of the evil that was threatened, my mind did not light, for\r\na moment, upon his image. Yet has he not avowed himself my enemy? Why\r\nshould he be here if he had not meditated evil?\r\n\r\nHe confesses that this has been his second attempt. What was the scene\r\nof his former conspiracy? Was it not he whose whispers betrayed him? Am\r\nI deceived; or was there not a faint resemblance between the voice of\r\nthis man and that which talked of grasping my throat, and extinguishing\r\nmy life in a moment? Then he had a colleague in his crime; now he\r\nis alone. Then death was the scope of his thoughts; now an injury\r\nunspeakably more dreadful. How thankful should I be to the power that\r\nhas interposed to save me!\r\n\r\nThat power is invisible. It is subject to the cognizance of one of my\r\nsenses. What are the means that will inform me of what nature it is?\r\nHe has set himself to counterwork the machinations of this man, who had\r\nmenaced destruction to all that is dear to me, and whose cunning had\r\nsurmounted every human impediment. There was none to rescue me from\r\nhis grasp. My rashness even hastened the completion of his scheme, and\r\nprecluded him from the benefits of deliberation. I had robbed him of the\r\npower to repent and forbear. Had I been apprized of the danger, I should\r\nhave regarded my conduct as the means of rendering my escape from it\r\nimpossible. Such, likewise, seem to have been the fears of my invisible\r\nprotector. Else why that startling intreaty to refrain from opening the\r\ncloset? By what inexplicable infatuation was I compelled to proceed?\r\n\r\nYet my conduct was wise. Carwin, unable to comprehend my folly, ascribed\r\nmy behaviour to my knowledge. He conceived himself previously detected,\r\nand such detection being possible to flow only from MY heavenly friend,\r\nand HIS enemy, his fears acquired additional strength.\r\n\r\nHe is apprized of the nature and intentions of this being. Perhaps he\r\nis a human agent. Yet, on that supposition his atchievements are\r\nincredible. Why should I be selected as the object of his care; or, if\r\na mere mortal, should I not recognize some one, whom, benefits imparted\r\nand received had prompted to love me? What were the limits and duration\r\nof his guardianship? Was the genius of my birth entrusted by divine\r\nbenignity with this province? Are human faculties adequate to\r\nreceive stronger proofs of the existence of unfettered and beneficent\r\nintelligences than I have received?\r\n\r\nBut who was this man's coadjutor? The voice that acknowledged an\r\nalliance in treachery with Carwin warned me to avoid the summer-house.\r\nHe assured me that there only my safety was endangered. His assurance,\r\nas it now appears, was fallacious. Was there not deceit in his\r\nadmonition? Was his compact really annulled? Some purpose was, perhaps,\r\nto be accomplished by preventing my future visits to that spot. Why was\r\nI enjoined silence to others, on the subject of this admonition, unless\r\nit were for some unauthorized and guilty purpose?\r\n\r\nNo one but myself was accustomed to visit it. Backward, it was hidden\r\nfrom distant view by the rock, and in front, it was screened from all\r\nexamination, by creeping plants, and the branches of cedars. What\r\nrecess could be more propitious to secrecy? The spirit which haunted it\r\nformerly was pure and rapturous. It was a fane sacred to the memory\r\nof infantile days, and to blissful imaginations of the future! What a\r\ngloomy reverse had succeeded since the ominous arrival of this stranger!\r\nNow, perhaps, it is the scene of his meditations. Purposes fraught with\r\nhorror, that shun the light, and contemplate the pollution of innocence,\r\nare here engendered, and fostered, and reared to maturity.\r\n\r\nSuch were the ideas that, during the night, were tumultuously revolved\r\nby me. I reviewed every conversation in which Carwin had borne a part.\r\nI studied to discover the true inferences deducible from his deportment\r\nand words with regard to his former adventures and actual views. I\r\npondered on the comments which he made on the relation which I had given\r\nof the closet dialogue. No new ideas suggested themselves in the course\r\nof this review. My expectation had, from the first, been disappointed\r\non the small degree of surprize which this narrative excited in him. He\r\nnever explicitly declared his opinion as to the nature of those voices,\r\nor decided whether they were real or visionary. He recommended no\r\nmeasures of caution or prevention.\r\n\r\nBut what measures were now to be taken? Was the danger which threatened\r\nme at an end? Had I nothing more to fear? I was lonely, and without\r\nmeans of defence. I could not calculate the motives and regulate the\r\nfootsteps of this person. What certainty was there, that he would not\r\nre-assume his purposes, and swiftly return to the execution of them?\r\n\r\nThis idea covered me once more with dismay. How deeply did I regret the\r\nsolitude in which I was placed, and how ardently did I desire the return\r\nof day! But neither of these inconveniencies were susceptible of remedy.\r\nAt first, it occurred to me to summon my servant, and make her spend the\r\nnight in my chamber; but the inefficacy of this expedient to enhance my\r\nsafety was easily seen. Once I resolved to leave the house, and retire\r\nto my brother's, but was deterred by reflecting on the unseasonableness\r\nof the hour, on the alarm which my arrival, and the account which I\r\nshould be obliged to give, might occasion, and on the danger to which I\r\nmight expose myself in the way thither. I began, likewise, to consider\r\nCarwin's return to molest me as exceedingly improbable. He had\r\nrelinquished, of his own accord, his design, and departed without\r\ncompulsion. \"Surely,\" said I, \"there is omnipotence in the cause that\r\nchanged the views of a man like Carwin. The divinity that shielded me\r\nfrom his attempts will take suitable care of my future safety. Thus to\r\nyield to my fears is to deserve that they should be real.\"\r\n\r\nScarcely had I uttered these words, when my attention was startled by\r\nthe sound of footsteps. They denoted some one stepping into the piazza\r\nin front of my house. My new-born confidence was extinguished in a\r\nmoment. Carwin, I thought, had repented his departure, and was hastily\r\nreturning. The possibility that his return was prompted by intentions\r\nconsistent with my safety, found no place in my mind. Images of\r\nviolation and murder assailed me anew, and the terrors which succeeded\r\nalmost incapacitated me from taking any measures for my defence. It was\r\nan impulse of which I was scarcely conscious, that made me fasten the\r\nlock and draw the bolts of my chamber door. Having done this, I threw\r\nmyself on a seat; for I trembled to a degree which disabled me from\r\nstanding, and my soul was so perfectly absorbed in the act of listening,\r\nthat almost the vital motions were stopped.\r\n\r\nThe door below creaked on its hinges. It was not again thrust to, but\r\nappeared to remain open. Footsteps entered, traversed the entry, and\r\nbegan to mount the stairs. How I detested the folly of not pursuing the\r\nman when he withdrew, and bolting after him the outer door! Might he not\r\nconceive this omission to be a proof that my angel had deserted me, and\r\nbe thereby fortified in guilt?\r\n\r\nEvery step on the stairs, which brought him nearer to my chamber, added\r\nvigor to my desperation. The evil with which I was menaced was to be at\r\nany rate eluded. How little did I preconceive the conduct which, in an\r\nexigence like this, I should be prone to adopt. You will suppose that\r\ndeliberation and despair would have suggested the same course of action,\r\nand that I should have, unhesitatingly, resorted to the best means of\r\npersonal defence within my power. A penknife lay open upon my table. I\r\nremembered that it was there, and seized it. For what purpose you will\r\nscarcely inquire. It will be immediately supposed that I meant it for my\r\nlast refuge, and that if all other means should fail, I should plunge it\r\ninto the heart of my ravisher.\r\n\r\nI have lost all faith in the stedfastness of human resolves. It was thus\r\nthat in periods of calm I had determined to act. No cowardice had been\r\nheld by me in greater abhorrence than that which prompted an injured\r\nfemale to destroy, not her injurer ere the injury was perpetrated, but\r\nherself when it was without remedy. Yet now this penknife appeared to\r\nme of no other use than to baffle my assailant, and prevent the crime\r\nby destroying myself. To deliberate at such a time was impossible; but\r\namong the tumultuous suggestions of the moment, I do not recollect that\r\nit once occurred to me to use it as an instrument of direct defence. The\r\nsteps had now reached the second floor. Every footfall accelerated the\r\ncompletion, without augmenting, the certainty of evil. The consciousness\r\nthat the door was fast, now that nothing but that was interposed between\r\nme and danger, was a source of some consolation. I cast my eye towards\r\nthe window. This, likewise, was a new suggestion. If the door should\r\ngive way, it was my sudden resolution to throw myself from the window.\r\nIts height from the ground, which was covered beneath by a brick\r\npavement, would insure my destruction; but I thought not of that.\r\n\r\nWhen opposite to my door the footsteps ceased. Was he listening whether\r\nmy fears were allayed, and my caution were asleep? Did he hope to take\r\nme by surprize? Yet, if so, why did he allow so many noisy signals to\r\nbetray his approach? Presently the steps were again heard to approach\r\nthe door. An hand was laid upon the lock, and the latch pulled back. Did\r\nhe imagine it possible that I should fail to secure the door? A slight\r\neffort was made to push it open, as if all bolts being withdrawn, a\r\nslight effort only was required.\r\n\r\nI no sooner perceived this, than I moved swiftly towards the window.\r\nCarwin's frame might be said to be all muscle. His strength and activity\r\nhad appeared, in various instances, to be prodigious. A slight exertion\r\nof his force would demolish the door. Would not that exertion be made?\r\nToo surely it would; but, at the same moment that this obstacle should\r\nyield, and he should enter the apartment, my determination was formed to\r\nleap from the window. My senses were still bound to this object. I gazed\r\nat the door in momentary expectation that the assault would be made. The\r\npause continued. The person without was irresolute and motionless.\r\n\r\nSuddenly, it occurred to me that Carwin might conceive me to have fled.\r\nThat I had not betaken myself to flight was, indeed, the least probable\r\nof all conclusions. In this persuasion he must have been confirmed on\r\nfinding the lower door unfastened, and the chamber door locked. Was\r\nit not wise to foster this persuasion? Should I maintain deep silence,\r\nthis, in addition to other circumstances, might encourage the belief,\r\nand he would once more depart. Every new reflection added plausibility\r\nto this reasoning. It was presently more strongly enforced, when I\r\nnoticed footsteps withdrawing from the door. The blood once more flowed\r\nback to my heart, and a dawn of exultation began to rise: but my joy was\r\nshort lived. Instead of descending the stairs, he passed to the door of\r\nthe opposite chamber, opened it, and having entered, shut it after him\r\nwith a violence that shook the house.\r\n\r\nHow was I to interpret this circumstance? For what end could he have\r\nentered this chamber? Did the violence with which he closed the door\r\ntestify the depth of his vexation? This room was usually occupied by\r\nPleyel. Was Carwin aware of his absence on this night? Could he be\r\nsuspected of a design so sordid as pillage? If this were his view there\r\nwere no means in my power to frustrate it. It behoved me to seize the\r\nfirst opportunity to escape; but if my escape were supposed by my\r\nenemy to have been already effected, no asylum was more secure than the\r\npresent. How could my passage from the house be accomplished without\r\nnoises that might incite him to pursue me?\r\n\r\nUtterly at a loss to account for his going into Pleyel's chamber, I\r\nwaited in instant expectation of hearing him come forth. All, however,\r\nwas profoundly still. I listened in vain for a considerable period, to\r\ncatch the sound of the door when it should again be opened. There was\r\nno other avenue by which he could escape, but a door which led into the\r\ngirl's chamber. Would any evil from this quarter befall the girl?\r\n\r\nHence arose a new train of apprehensions. They merely added to the\r\nturbulence and agony of my reflections. Whatever evil impended over her,\r\nI had no power to avert it. Seclusion and silence were the only means of\r\nsaving myself from the perils of this fatal night. What solemn vows did\r\nI put up, that if I should once more behold the light of day, I would\r\nnever trust myself again within the threshold of this dwelling!\r\n\r\nMinute lingered after minute, but no token was given that Carwin had\r\nreturned to the passage. What, I again asked, could detain him in this\r\nroom? Was it possible that he had returned, and glided, unperceived,\r\naway? I was speedily aware of the difficulty that attended an enterprize\r\nlike this; and yet, as if by that means I were capable of gaining any\r\ninformation on that head, I cast anxious looks from the window.\r\n\r\nThe object that first attracted my attention was an human figure\r\nstanding on the edge of the bank. Perhaps my penetration was assisted\r\nby my hopes. Be that as it will, the figure of Carwin was clearly\r\ndistinguishable. From the obscurity of my station, it was impossible\r\nthat I should be discerned by him, and yet he scarcely suffered me to\r\ncatch a glimpse of him. He turned and went down the steep, which, in\r\nthis part, was not difficult to be scaled.\r\n\r\nMy conjecture then had been right. Carwin has softly opened the door,\r\ndescended the stairs, and issued forth. That I should not have overheard\r\nhis steps, was only less incredible than that my eyes had deceived me.\r\nBut what was now to be done? The house was at length delivered from this\r\ndetested inmate. By one avenue might he again re-enter. Was it not wise\r\nto bar the lower door? Perhaps he had gone out by the kitchen door. For\r\nthis end, he must have passed through Judith's chamber. These entrances\r\nbeing closed and bolted, as great security was gained as was compatible\r\nwith my lonely condition.\r\n\r\nThe propriety of these measures was too manifest not to make me struggle\r\nsuccessfully with my fears. Yet I opened my own door with the utmost\r\ncaution, and descended as if I were afraid that Carwin had been still\r\nimmured in Pleyel's chamber. The outer door was a-jar. I shut, with\r\ntrembling eagerness, and drew every bolt that appended to it. I then\r\npassed with light and less cautious steps through the parlour, but was\r\nsurprized to discover that the kitchen door was secure. I was compelled\r\nto acquiesce in the first conjecture that Carwin had escaped through the\r\nentry.\r\n\r\nMy heart was now somewhat eased of the load of apprehension. I returned\r\nonce more to my chamber, the door of which I was careful to lock. It was\r\nno time to think of repose. The moon-light began already to fade before\r\nthe light of the day. The approach of morning was betokened by the usual\r\nsignals. I mused upon the events of this night, and determined to take\r\nup my abode henceforth at my brother's. Whether I should inform him\r\nof what had happened was a question which seemed to demand some\r\nconsideration. My safety unquestionably required that I should abandon\r\nmy present habitation.\r\n\r\nAs my thoughts began to flow with fewer impediments, the image of\r\nPleyel, and the dubiousness of his condition, again recurred to me. I\r\nagain ran over the possible causes of his absence on the preceding day.\r\nMy mind was attuned to melancholy. I dwelt, with an obstinacy for which\r\nI could not account, on the idea of his death. I painted to myself his\r\nstruggles with the billows, and his last appearance. I imagined myself\r\na midnight wanderer on the shore, and to have stumbled on his corpse,\r\nwhich the tide had cast up. These dreary images affected me even to\r\ntears. I endeavoured not to restrain them. They imparted a relief which\r\nI had not anticipated. The more copiously they flowed, the more did\r\nmy general sensations appear to subside into calm, and a certain\r\nrestlessness give way to repose.\r\n\r\nPerhaps, relieved by this effusion, the slumber so much wanted might\r\nhave stolen on my senses, had there been no new cause of alarm.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter XI\r\n\r\n\r\nI was aroused from this stupor by sounds that evidently arose in the\r\nnext chamber. Was it possible that I had been mistaken in the figure\r\nwhich I had seen on the bank? or had Carwin, by some inscrutable means,\r\npenetrated once more into this chamber? The opposite door opened;\r\nfootsteps came forth, and the person, advancing to mine, knocked.\r\n\r\nSo unexpected an incident robbed me of all presence of mind, and,\r\nstarting up, I involuntarily exclaimed, \"Who is there?\" An answer was\r\nimmediately given. The voice, to my inexpressible astonishment, was\r\nPleyel's.\r\n\r\n\"It is I. Have you risen? If you have not, make haste; I want three\r\nminutes conversation with you in the parlour--I will wait for you\r\nthere.\" Saying this he retired from the door.\r\n\r\nShould I confide in the testimony of my ears? If that were true, it was\r\nPleyel that had been hitherto immured in the opposite chamber: he whom\r\nmy rueful fancy had depicted in so many ruinous and ghastly shapes: he\r\nwhose footsteps had been listened to with such inquietude! What is man,\r\nthat knowledge is so sparingly conferred upon him! that his heart should\r\nbe wrung with distress, and his frame be exanimated with fear, though\r\nhis safety be encompassed with impregnable walls! What are the bounds\r\nof human imbecility! He that warned me of the presence of my foe refused\r\nthe intimation by which so many racking fears would have been precluded.\r\n\r\nYet who would have imagined the arrival of Pleyel at such an hour? His\r\ntone was desponding and anxious. Why this unseasonable summons? and why\r\nthis hasty departure? Some tidings he, perhaps, bears of mysterious and\r\nunwelcome import.\r\n\r\nMy impatience would not allow me to consume much time in deliberation: I\r\nhastened down. Pleyel I found standing at a window, with eyes cast\r\ndown as in meditation, and arms folded on his breast. Every line in\r\nhis countenance was pregnant with sorrow. To this was added a certain\r\nwanness and air of fatigue. The last time I had seen him appearances\r\nhad been the reverse of these. I was startled at the change. The first\r\nimpulse was to question him as to the cause. This impulse was supplanted\r\nby some degree of confusion, flowing from a consciousness that love had\r\ntoo large, and, as it might prove, a perceptible share in creating this\r\nimpulse. I was silent.\r\n\r\nPresently he raised his eyes and fixed them upon me. I read in them an\r\nanguish altogether ineffable. Never had I witnessed a like demeanour\r\nin Pleyel. Never, indeed, had I observed an human countenance in which\r\ngrief was more legibly inscribed. He seemed struggling for utterance;\r\nbut his struggles being fruitless, he shook his head and turned away\r\nfrom me.\r\n\r\nMy impatience would not allow me to be longer silent: \"What,\" said I,\r\n\"for heaven's sake, my friend, what is the matter?\"\r\n\r\nHe started at the sound of my voice. His looks, for a moment, became\r\nconvulsed with an emotion very different from grief. His accents were\r\nbroken with rage.\r\n\r\n\"The matter--O wretch!--thus exquisitely fashioned--on whom nature\r\nseemed to have exhausted all her graces; with charms so awful and\r\nso pure! how art thou fallen! From what height fallen! A ruin so\r\ncomplete--so unheard of!\"\r\n\r\nHis words were again choaked by emotion. Grief and pity were again\r\nmingled in his features. He resumed, in a tone half suffocated by sobs:\r\n\r\n\"But why should I upbraid thee? Could I restore to thee what thou hast\r\nlost; efface this cursed stain; snatch thee from the jaws of this fiend;\r\nI would do it. Yet what will avail my efforts? I have not arms with\r\nwhich to contend with so consummate, so frightful a depravity.\r\n\r\n\"Evidence less than this would only have excited resentment and scorn.\r\nThe wretch who should have breathed a suspicion injurious to thy honor,\r\nwould have been regarded without anger; not hatred or envy could have\r\nprompted him; it would merely be an argument of madness. That my eyes,\r\nthat my ears, should bear witness to thy fall! By no other way could\r\ndetestible conviction be imparted.\r\n\r\n\"Why do I summon thee to this conference? Why expose myself to thy\r\nderision? Here admonition and entreaty are vain. Thou knowest him\r\nalready, for a murderer and thief. I had thought to have been the first\r\nto disclose to thee his infamy; to have warned thee of the pit to\r\nwhich thou art hastening; but thy eyes are open in vain. O foul and\r\ninsupportable disgrace!\r\n\r\n\"There is but one path. I know you will disappear together. In thy ruin,\r\nhow will the felicity and honor of multitudes be involved! But it must\r\ncome. This scene shall not be blotted by his presence. No doubt thou\r\nwilt shortly see thy detested paramour. This scene will be again\r\npolluted by a midnight assignation. Inform him of his danger; tell him\r\nthat his crimes are known; let him fly far and instantly from this spot,\r\nif he desires to avoid the fate which menaced him in Ireland.\r\n\r\n\"And wilt thou not stay behind?--But shame upon my weakness. I know\r\nnot what I would say.--I have done what I purposed. To stay longer, to\r\nexpostulate, to beseech, to enumerate the consequences of thy act--what\r\nend can it serve but to blazon thy infamy and embitter our woes? And\r\nyet, O think, think ere it be too late, on the distresses which thy\r\nflight will entail upon us; on the base, grovelling, and atrocious\r\ncharacter of the wretch to whom thou hast sold thy honor. But what\r\nis this? Is not thy effrontery impenetrable, and thy heart thoroughly\r\ncankered? O most specious, and most profligate of women!\"\r\n\r\nSaying this, he rushed out of the house. I saw him in a few moments\r\nhurrying along the path which led to my brother's. I had no power to\r\nprevent his going, or to recall, or to follow him. The accents I had\r\nheard were calculated to confound and bewilder. I looked around me to\r\nassure myself that the scene was real. I moved that I might banish the\r\ndoubt that I was awake. Such enormous imputations from the mouth of\r\nPleyel! To be stigmatized with the names of wanton and profligate! To\r\nbe charged with the sacrifice of honor! with midnight meetings with a\r\nwretch known to be a murderer and thief! with an intention to fly in his\r\ncompany!\r\n\r\nWhat I had heard was surely the dictate of phrenzy, or it was built\r\nupon some fatal, some incomprehensible mistake. After the horrors of the\r\nnight; after undergoing perils so imminent from this man, to be summoned\r\nto an interview like this; to find Pleyel fraught with a belief that,\r\ninstead of having chosen death as a refuge from the violence of this\r\nman, I had hugged his baseness to my heart, had sacrificed for him my\r\npurity, my spotless name, my friendships, and my fortune! that even\r\nmadness could engender accusations like these was not to be believed.\r\n\r\nWhat evidence could possibly suggest conceptions so wild? After the\r\nunlooked-for interview with Carwin in my chamber, he retired. Could\r\nPleyel have observed his exit? It was not long after that Pleyel himself\r\nentered. Did he build on this incident, his odious conclusions? Could\r\nthe long series of my actions and sentiments grant me no exemption from\r\nsuspicions so foul? Was it not more rational to infer that Carwin's\r\ndesigns had been illicit; that my life had been endangered by the fury\r\nof one whom, by some means, he had discovered to be an assassin and\r\nrobber; that my honor had been assailed, not by blandishments, but by\r\nviolence?\r\n\r\nHe has judged me without hearing. He has drawn from dubious appearances,\r\nconclusions the most improbable and unjust. He has loaded me with all\r\noutrageous epithets. He has ranked me with prostitutes and thieves. I\r\ncannot pardon thee, Pleyel, for this injustice. Thy understanding must\r\nbe hurt. If it be not, if thy conduct was sober and deliberate, I can\r\nnever forgive an outrage so unmanly, and so gross.\r\n\r\nThese thoughts gradually gave place to others. Pleyel was possessed by\r\nsome momentary phrenzy: appearances had led him into palpable errors.\r\nWhence could his sagacity have contracted this blindness? Was it not\r\nlove? Previously assured of my affection for Carwin, distracted with\r\ngrief and jealousy, and impelled hither at that late hour by some\r\nunknown instigation, his imagination transformed shadows into monsters,\r\nand plunged him into these deplorable errors.\r\n\r\nThis idea was not unattended with consolation. My soul was divided\r\nbetween indignation at his injustice, and delight on account of the\r\nsource from which I conceived it to spring. For a long time they would\r\nallow admission to no other thoughts. Surprize is an emotion that\r\nenfeebles, not invigorates. All my meditations were accompanied\r\nwith wonder. I rambled with vagueness, or clung to one image with an\r\nobstinacy which sufficiently testified the maddening influence of late\r\ntransactions.\r\n\r\nGradually I proceeded to reflect upon the consequences of Pleyel's\r\nmistake, and on the measures I should take to guard myself against\r\nfuture injury from Carwin. Should I suffer this mistake to be detected\r\nby time? When his passion should subside, would he not perceive the\r\nflagrancy of his injustice, and hasten to atone for it? Did it not\r\nbecome my character to testify resentment for language and treatment so\r\nopprobrious? Wrapt up in the consciousness of innocence, and confiding\r\nin the influence of time and reflection to confute so groundless a\r\ncharge, it was my province to be passive and silent.\r\n\r\nAs to the violences meditated by Carwin, and the means of eluding them,\r\nthe path to be taken by me was obvious. I resolved to tell the tale to\r\nmy brother, and regulate myself by his advice. For this end, when the\r\nmorning was somewhat advanced, I took the way to his house. My sister\r\nwas engaged in her customary occupations. As soon as I appeared, she\r\nremarked a change in my looks. I was not willing to alarm her by the\r\ninformation which I had to communicate. Her health was in that condition\r\nwhich rendered a disastrous tale particularly unsuitable. I forbore a\r\ndirect answer to her inquiries, and inquired, in my turn, for Wieland.\r\n\r\n\"Why,\" said she, \"I suspect something mysterious and unpleasant has\r\nhappened this morning. Scarcely had we risen when Pleyel dropped among\r\nus. What could have prompted him to make us so early and so unseasonable\r\na visit I cannot tell. To judge from the disorder of his dress, and\r\nhis countenance, something of an extraordinary nature has occurred. He\r\npermitted me merely to know that he had slept none, nor even undressed,\r\nduring the past night. He took your brother to walk with him. Some\r\ntopic must have deeply engaged them, for Wieland did not return till\r\nthe breakfast hour was passed, and returned alone. His disturbance was\r\nexcessive; but he would not listen to my importunities, or tell me\r\nwhat had happened. I gathered from hints which he let fall, that your\r\nsituation was, in some way, the cause: yet he assured me that you were\r\nat your own house, alive, in good health, and in perfect safety. He\r\nscarcely ate a morsel, and immediately after breakfast went out again.\r\nHe would not inform me whither he was going, but mentioned that he\r\nprobably might not return before night.\"\r\n\r\nI was equally astonished and alarmed by this information. Pleyel had\r\ntold his tale to my brother, and had, by a plausible and exaggerated\r\npicture, instilled into him unfavorable thoughts of me. Yet would not\r\nthe more correct judgment of Wieland perceive and expose the fallacy of\r\nhis conclusions? Perhaps his uneasiness might arise from some insight\r\ninto the character of Carwin, and from apprehensions for my safety. The\r\nappearances by which Pleyel had been misled, might induce him likewise\r\nto believe that I entertained an indiscreet, though not dishonorable\r\naffection for Carwin. Such were the conjectures rapidly formed. I was\r\ninexpressibly anxious to change them into certainty. For this end\r\nan interview with my brother was desirable. He was gone, no one knew\r\nwhither, and was not expected speedily to return. I had no clue by which\r\nto trace his footsteps.\r\n\r\nMy anxieties could not be concealed from my sister. They heightened\r\nher solicitude to be acquainted with the cause. There were many reasons\r\npersuading me to silence: at least, till I had seen my brother, it would\r\nbe an act of inexcusable temerity to unfold what had lately passed. No\r\nother expedient for eluding her importunities occurred to me, but that\r\nof returning to my own house. I recollected my determination to become a\r\ntenant of this roof. I mentioned it to her. She joyfully acceded to this\r\nproposal, and suffered me, with less reluctance, to depart, when I told\r\nher that it was with a view to collect and send to my new dwelling what\r\narticles would be immediately useful to me.\r\n\r\nOnce more I returned to the house which had been the scene of so\r\nmuch turbulence and danger. I was at no great distance from it when\r\nI observed my brother coming out. On seeing me he stopped, and after\r\nascertaining, as it seemed, which way I was going, he returned into the\r\nhouse before me. I sincerely rejoiced at this event, and I hastened to\r\nset things, if possible, on their right footing.\r\n\r\nHis brow was by no means expressive of those vehement emotions with\r\nwhich Pleyel had been agitated. I drew a favorable omen from this\r\ncircumstance. Without delay I began the conversation.\r\n\r\n\"I have been to look for you,\" said I, \"but was told by Catharine that\r\nPleyel had engaged you on some important and disagreeable affair. Before\r\nhis interview with you he spent a few minutes with me. These minutes he\r\nemployed in upbraiding me for crimes and intentions with which I am by\r\nno means chargeable. I believe him to have taken up his opinions on\r\nvery insufficient grounds. His behaviour was in the highest degree\r\nprecipitate and unjust, and, until I receive some atonement, I shall\r\ntreat him, in my turn, with that contempt which he justly merits:\r\nmeanwhile I am fearful that he has prejudiced my brother against me.\r\nThat is an evil which I most anxiously deprecate, and which I shall\r\nindeed exert myself to remove. Has he made me the subject of this\r\nmorning's conversation?\"\r\n\r\nMy brother's countenance testified no surprize at my address. The\r\nbenignity of his looks were no wise diminished.\r\n\r\n\"It is true,\" said he, \"your conduct was the subject of our discourse. I\r\nam your friend, as well as your brother. There is no human being whom I\r\nlove with more tenderness, and whose welfare is nearer my heart. Judge\r\nthen with what emotions I listened to Pleyel's story. I expect and\r\ndesire you to vindicate yourself from aspersions so foul, if vindication\r\nbe possible.\"\r\n\r\nThe tone with which he uttered the last words affected me deeply. \"If\r\nvindication be possible!\" repeated I. \"From what you know, do you deem a\r\nformal vindication necessary? Can you harbour for a moment the belief of\r\nmy guilt?\"\r\n\r\nHe shook his head with an air of acute anguish. \"I have struggled,\" said\r\nhe, \"to dismiss that belief. You speak before a judge who will profit by\r\nany pretence to acquit you: who is ready to question his own senses when\r\nthey plead against you.\"\r\n\r\nThese words incited a new set of thoughts in my mind. I began to suspect\r\nthat Pleyel had built his accusations on some foundation unknown to me.\r\n\"I may be a stranger to the grounds of your belief. Pleyel loaded me\r\nwith indecent and virulent invectives, but he withheld from me the facts\r\nthat generated his suspicions. Events took place last night of which\r\nsome of the circumstances were of an ambiguous nature. I conceived that\r\nthese might possibly have fallen under his cognizance, and that, viewed\r\nthrough the mists of prejudice and passion, they supplied a pretence\r\nfor his conduct, but believed that your more unbiassed judgment would\r\nestimate them at their just value. Perhaps his tale has been different\r\nfrom what I suspect it to be. Listen then to my narrative. If there be\r\nany thing in his story inconsistent with mine, his story is false.\"\r\n\r\nI then proceeded to a circumstantial relation of the incidents of the\r\nlast night. Wieland listened with deep attention. Having finished,\r\n\"This,\" continued I, \"is the truth; you see in what circumstances an\r\ninterview took place between Carwin and me. He remained for hours in my\r\ncloset, and for some minutes in my chamber. He departed without haste or\r\ninterruption. If Pleyel marked him as he left the house, and it is\r\nnot impossible that he did, inferences injurious to my character might\r\nsuggest themselves to him. In admitting them, he gave proofs of less\r\ndiscernment and less candor than I once ascribed to him.\"\r\n\r\n\"His proofs,\" said Wieland, after a considerable pause, \"are different.\r\nThat he should be deceived, is not possible. That he himself is not the\r\ndeceiver, could not be believed, if his testimony were not inconsistent\r\nwith yours; but the doubts which I entertained are now removed. Your\r\ntale, some parts of it, is marvellous; the voice which exclaimed against\r\nyour rashness in approaching the closet, your persisting notwithstanding\r\nthat prohibition, your belief that I was the ruffian, and your\r\nsubsequent conduct, are believed by me, because I have known you from\r\nchildhood, because a thousand instances have attested your veracity, and\r\nbecause nothing less than my own hearing and vision would convince me,\r\nin opposition to her own assertions, that my sister had fallen into\r\nwickedness like this.\"\r\n\r\nI threw my arms around him, and bathed his cheek with my tears. \"That,\"\r\nsaid I, \"is spoken like my brother. But what are the proofs?\"\r\n\r\nHe replied--\"Pleyel informed me that, in going to your house, his\r\nattention was attracted by two voices. The persons speaking sat beneath\r\nthe bank out of sight. These persons, judging by their voices, were\r\nCarwin and you. I will not repeat the dialogue. If my sister was the\r\nfemale, Pleyel was justified in concluding you to be, indeed, one of the\r\nmost profligate of women. Hence, his accusations of you, and his efforts\r\nto obtain my concurrence to a plan by which an eternal separation should\r\nbe brought about between my sister and this man.\"\r\n\r\nI made Wieland repeat this recital. Here, indeed, was a tale to fill me\r\nwith terrible foreboding. I had vainly thought that my safety could be\r\nsufficiently secured by doors and bars, but this is a foe from whose\r\ngrasp no power of divinity can save me! His artifices will ever lay my\r\nfame and happiness at his mercy. How shall I counterwork his plots, or\r\ndetect his coadjutor? He has taught some vile and abandoned female to\r\nmimic my voice. Pleyel's ears were the witnesses of my dishonor. This\r\nis the midnight assignation to which he alluded. Thus is the silence\r\nhe maintained when attempting to open the door of my chamber, accounted\r\nfor. He supposed me absent, and meant, perhaps, had my apartment been\r\naccessible, to leave in it some accusing memorial.\r\n\r\nPleyel was no longer equally culpable. The sincerity of his anguish, the\r\ndepth of his despair, I remembered with some tendencies to gratitude.\r\nYet was he not precipitate? Was the conjecture that my part was played\r\nby some mimic so utterly untenable? Instances of this faculty are\r\ncommon. The wickedness of Carwin must, in his opinion, have been\r\nadequate to such contrivances, and yet the supposition of my guilt was\r\nadopted in preference to that.\r\n\r\nBut how was this error to be unveiled? What but my own assertion had I\r\nto throw in the balance against it? Would this be permitted to outweigh\r\nthe testimony of his senses? I had no witnesses to prove my existence\r\nin another place. The real events of that night are marvellous. Few, to\r\nwhom they should be related, would scruple to discredit them. Pleyel is\r\nsceptical in a transcendant degree. I cannot summon Carwin to my bar,\r\nand make him the attestor of my innocence, and the accuser of himself.\r\n\r\nMy brother saw and comprehended my distress. He was unacquainted,\r\nhowever, with the full extent of it. He knew not by how many motives\r\nI was incited to retrieve the good opinion of Pleyel. He endeavored\r\nto console me. Some new event, he said, would occur to disentangle the\r\nmaze. He did not question the influence of my eloquence, if I thought\r\nproper to exert it. Why not seek an interview with Pleyel, and exact\r\nfrom him a minute relation, in which something may be met with serving\r\nto destroy the probability of the whole?\r\n\r\nI caught, with eagerness, at this hope; but my alacrity was damped by\r\nnew reflections. Should I, perfect in this respect, and unblemished as\r\nI was, thrust myself, uncalled, into his presence, and make my felicity\r\ndepend upon his arbitrary verdict?\r\n\r\n\"If you chuse to seek an interview,\" continued Wieland, \"you must make\r\nhaste, for Pleyel informed me of his intention to set out this evening\r\nor to-morrow on a long journey.\"\r\n\r\nNo intelligence was less expected or less welcome than this. I had\r\nthrown myself in a window seat; but now, starting on my feet, I\r\nexclaimed, \"Good heavens! what is it you say? a journey? whither? when?\"\r\n\r\n\"I cannot say whither. It is a sudden resolution I believe. I did not\r\nhear of it till this morning. He promises to write to me as soon as he\r\nis settled.\"\r\n\r\nI needed no further information as to the cause and issue of this\r\njourney. The scheme of happiness to which he had devoted his thoughts\r\nwas blasted by the discovery of last night. My preference of another,\r\nand my unworthiness to be any longer the object of his adoration, were\r\nevinced by the same act and in the same moment. The thought of utter\r\ndesertion, a desertion originating in such a cause, was the prelude to\r\ndistraction. That Pleyel should abandon me forever, because I was blind\r\nto his excellence, because I coveted pollution, and wedded infamy, when,\r\non the contrary, my heart was the shrine of all purity, and beat only\r\nfor his sake, was a destiny which, as long as my life was in my own\r\nhands, I would by no means consent to endure.\r\n\r\nI remembered that this evil was still preventable; that this fatal\r\njourney it was still in my power to procrastinate, or, perhaps, to\r\noccasion it to be laid aside. There were no impediments to a visit: I\r\nonly dreaded lest the interview should be too long delayed. My brother\r\nbefriended my impatience, and readily consented to furnish me with a\r\nchaise and servant to attend me. My purpose was to go immediately to\r\nPleyel's farm, where his engagements usually detained him during the\r\nday.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter XII\r\n\r\n\r\nMy way lay through the city. I had scarcely entered it when I was seized\r\nwith a general sensation of sickness. Every object grew dim and swam\r\nbefore my sight. It was with difficulty I prevented myself from sinking\r\nto the bottom of the carriage. I ordered myself to be carried to Mrs.\r\nBaynton's, in hope that an interval of repose would invigorate and\r\nrefresh me. My distracted thoughts would allow me but little rest.\r\nGrowing somewhat better in the afternoon, I resumed my journey.\r\n\r\nMy contemplations were limited to a few objects. I regarded my success,\r\nin the purpose which I had in view, as considerably doubtful. I\r\ndepended, in some degree, on the suggestions of the moment, and on the\r\nmaterials which Pleyel himself should furnish me. When I reflected on\r\nthe nature of the accusation, I burned with disdain. Would not truth,\r\nand the consciousness of innocence, render me triumphant? Should I not\r\ncast from me, with irresistible force, such atrocious imputations?\r\n\r\nWhat an entire and mournful change has been effected in a few hours! The\r\ngulf that separates man from insects is not wider than that which severs\r\nthe polluted from the chaste among women. Yesterday and to-day I am the\r\nsame. There is a degree of depravity to which it is impossible for me\r\nto sink; yet, in the apprehension of another, my ancient and intimate\r\nassociate, the perpetual witness of my actions, and partaker of my\r\nthoughts, I had ceased to be the same. My integrity was tarnished\r\nand withered in his eyes. I was the colleague of a murderer, and the\r\nparamour of a thief!\r\n\r\nHis opinion was not destitute of evidence: yet what proofs could\r\nreasonably avail to establish an opinion like this? If the sentiments\r\ncorresponded not with the voice that was heard, the evidence was\r\ndeficient; but this want of correspondence would have been supposed by\r\nme if I had been the auditor and Pleyel the criminal. But mimicry might\r\nstill more plausibly have been employed to explain the scene. Alas! it\r\nis the fate of Clara Wieland to fall into the hands of a precipitate and\r\ninexorable judge.\r\n\r\nBut what, O man of mischief! is the tendency of thy thoughts? Frustrated\r\nin thy first design, thou wilt not forego the immolation of thy victim.\r\nTo exterminate my reputation was all that remained to thee, and this my\r\nguardian has permitted. To dispossess Pleyel of this prejudice may be\r\nimpossible; but if that be effected, it cannot be supposed that thy\r\nwiles are exhausted; thy cunning will discover innumerable avenues to\r\nthe accomplishment of thy malignant purpose.\r\n\r\nWhy should I enter the lists against thee? Would to heaven I could\r\ndisarm thy vengeance by my deprecations! When I think of all the\r\nresources with which nature and education have supplied thee; that thy\r\nform is a combination of steely fibres and organs of exquisite ductility\r\nand boundless compass, actuated by an intelligence gifted with infinite\r\nendowments, and comprehending all knowledge, I perceive that my doom\r\nis fixed. What obstacle will be able to divert thy zeal or repel thy\r\nefforts? That being who has hitherto protected me has borne testimony to\r\nthe formidableness of thy attempts, since nothing less than supernatural\r\ninterference could check thy career.\r\n\r\nMusing on these thoughts, I arrived, towards the close of the day, at\r\nPleyel's house. A month before, I had traversed the same path; but how\r\ndifferent were my sensations! Now I was seeking the presence of one who\r\nregarded me as the most degenerate of human kind. I was to plead the\r\ncause of my innocence, against witnesses the most explicit and unerring,\r\nof those which support the fabric of human knowledge. The nearer I\r\napproached the crisis, the more did my confidence decay. When the chaise\r\nstopped at the door, my strength refused to support me, and I threw\r\nmyself into the arms of an ancient female domestic. I had not courage to\r\ninquire whether her master was at home. I was tormented with fears that\r\nthe projected journey was already undertaken. These fears were removed,\r\nby her asking me whether she should call her young master, who had just\r\ngone into his own room. I was somewhat revived by this intelligence, and\r\nresolved immediately to seek him there.\r\n\r\nIn my confusion of mind, I neglected to knock at the door, but entered\r\nhis apartment without previous notice. This abruptness was altogether\r\ninvoluntary. Absorbed in reflections of such unspeakable moment, I had\r\nno leisure to heed the niceties of punctilio. I discovered him standing\r\nwith his back towards the entrance. A small trunk, with its lid raised,\r\nwas before him in which it seemed as if he had been busy in packing\r\nhis clothes. The moment of my entrance, he was employed in gazing at\r\nsomething which he held in his hand.\r\n\r\nI imagined that I fully comprehended this scene. The image which he held\r\nbefore him, and by which his attention was so deeply engaged, I doubted\r\nnot to be my own. These preparations for his journey, the cause to which\r\nit was to be imputed, the hopelessness of success in the undertaking on\r\nwhich I had entered, rushed at once upon my feelings, and dissolved me\r\ninto a flood of tears.\r\n\r\nStartled by this sound, he dropped the lid of the trunk and turned. The\r\nsolemn sadness that previously overspread his countenance, gave\r\nsudden way to an attitude and look of the most vehement astonishment.\r\nPerceiving me unable to uphold myself, he stepped towards me without\r\nspeaking, and supported me by his arm. The kindness of this action\r\ncalled forth a new effusion from my eyes. Weeping was a solace to\r\nwhich, at that time, I had not grown familiar, and which, therefore,\r\nwas peculiarly delicious. Indignation was no longer to be read in the\r\nfeatures of my friend. They were pregnant with a mixture of wonder and\r\npity. Their expression was easily interpreted. This visit, and these\r\ntears, were tokens of my penitence. The wretch whom he had stigmatized\r\nas incurably and obdurately wicked, now shewed herself susceptible of\r\nremorse, and had come to confess her guilt.\r\n\r\nThis persuasion had no tendency to comfort me. It only shewed me, with\r\nnew evidence, the difficulty of the task which I had assigned myself. We\r\nwere mutually silent. I had less power and less inclination than ever to\r\nspeak. I extricated myself from his hold, and threw myself on a sofa.\r\nHe placed himself by my side, and appeared to wait with impatience and\r\nanxiety for some beginning of the conversation. What could I say? If my\r\nmind had suggested any thing suitable to the occasion, my utterance was\r\nsuffocated by tears.\r\n\r\nFrequently he attempted to speak, but seemed deterred by some degree of\r\nuncertainty as to the true nature of the scene. At length, in faltering\r\naccents he spoke:\r\n\r\n\"My friend! would to heaven I were still permitted to call you by that\r\nname. The image that I once adored existed only in my fancy; but though\r\nI cannot hope to see it realized, you may not be totally insensible to\r\nthe horrors of that gulf into which you are about to plunge. What heart\r\nis forever exempt from the goadings of compunction and the influx of\r\nlaudable propensities?\r\n\r\n\"I thought you accomplished and wise beyond the rest of women. Not a\r\nsentiment you uttered, not a look you assumed, that were not, in\r\nmy apprehension, fraught with the sublimities of rectitude and the\r\nilluminations of genius. Deceit has some bounds. Your education could\r\nnot be without influence. A vigorous understanding cannot be utterly\r\ndevoid of virtue; but you could not counterfeit the powers of invention\r\nand reasoning. I was rash in my invectives. I will not, but with life,\r\nrelinquish all hopes of you. I will shut out every proof that would tell\r\nme that your heart is incurably diseased.\r\n\r\n\"You come to restore me once more to happiness; to convince me that you\r\nhave torn her mask from vice, and feel nothing but abhorrence for the\r\npart you have hitherto acted.\"\r\n\r\nAt these words my equanimity forsook me. For a moment I forgot the\r\nevidence from which Pleyel's opinions were derived, the benevolence of\r\nhis remonstrances, and the grief which his accents bespoke; I was filled\r\nwith indignation and horror at charges so black; I shrunk back and\r\ndarted at him a look of disdain and anger. My passion supplied me with\r\nwords.\r\n\r\n\"What detestable infatuation was it that led me hither! Why do I\r\npatiently endure these horrible insults! My offences exist only in\r\nyour own distempered imagination: you are leagued with the traitor who\r\nassailed my life: you have vowed the destruction of my peace and honor.\r\nI deserve infamy for listening to calumnies so base!\"\r\n\r\nThese words were heard by Pleyel without visible resentment. His\r\ncountenance relapsed into its former gloom; but he did not even look at\r\nme. The ideas which had given place to my angry emotions returned, and\r\nonce more melted me into tears. \"O!\" I exclaimed, in a voice broken by\r\nsobs, \"what a task is mine! Compelled to hearken to charges which I feel\r\nto be false, but which I know to be believed by him that utters them;\r\nbelieved too not without evidence, which, though fallacious, is not\r\nunplausible.\r\n\r\n\"I came hither not to confess, but to vindicate. I know the source\r\nof your opinions. Wieland has informed me on what your suspicions are\r\nbuilt. These suspicions are fostered by you as certainties; the tenor\r\nof my life, of all my conversations and letters, affords me no security;\r\nevery sentiment that my tongue and my pen have uttered, bear testimony\r\nto the rectitude of my mind; but this testimony is rejected. I am\r\ncondemned as brutally profligate: I am classed with the stupidly and\r\nsordidly wicked.\r\n\r\n\"And where are the proofs that must justify so foul and so improbable\r\nan accusation? You have overheard a midnight conference. Voices have\r\nsaluted your ear, in which you imagine yourself to have recognized\r\nmine, and that of a detected villain. The sentiments expressed were\r\nnot allowed to outweigh the casual or concerted resemblance of voice.\r\nSentiments the reverse of all those whose influence my former life had\r\nattested, denoting a mind polluted by grovelling vices, and entering\r\ninto compact with that of a thief and a murderer. The nature of these\r\nsentiments did not enable you to detect the cheat, did not suggest to\r\nyou the possibility that my voice had been counterfeited by another.\r\n\r\n\"You were precipitate and prone to condemn. Instead of rushing on the\r\nimpostors, and comparing the evidence of sight with that of hearing, you\r\nstood aloof, or you fled. My innocence would not now have stood in\r\nneed of vindication, if this conduct had been pursued. That you did not\r\npursue it, your present thoughts incontestibly prove. Yet this conduct\r\nmight surely have been expected from Pleyel. That he would not hastily\r\nimpute the blackest of crimes, that he would not couple my name with\r\ninfamy, and cover me with ruin for inadequate or slight reasons, might\r\nreasonably have been expected.\" The sobs which convulsed my bosom would\r\nnot suffer me to proceed.\r\n\r\nPleyel was for a moment affected. He looked at me with some expression\r\nof doubt; but this quickly gave place to a mournful solemnity. He fixed\r\nhis eyes on the floor as in reverie, and spoke:\r\n\r\n\"Two hours hence I am gone. Shall I carry away with me the sorrow that\r\nis now my guest? or shall that sorrow be accumulated tenfold? What is\r\nshe that is now before me? Shall every hour supply me with new proofs of\r\na wickedness beyond example? Already I deem her the most abandoned and\r\ndetestable of human creatures. Her coming and her tears imparted a gleam\r\nof hope, but that gleam has vanished.\"\r\n\r\nHe now fixed his eyes upon me, and every muscle in his face trembled.\r\nHis tone was hollow and terrible--\"Thou knowest that I was a witness of\r\nyour interview, yet thou comest hither to upbraid me for injustice! Thou\r\ncanst look me in the face and say that I am deceived!--An inscrutable\r\nprovidence has fashioned thee for some end. Thou wilt live, no doubt, to\r\nfulfil the purposes of thy maker, if he repent not of his workmanship,\r\nand send not his vengeance to exterminate thee, ere the measure of thy\r\ndays be full. Surely nothing in the shape of man can vie with thee!\r\n\r\n\"But I thought I had stifled this fury. I am not constituted thy judge.\r\nMy office is to pity and amend, and not to punish and revile. I deemed\r\nmyself exempt from all tempestuous passions. I had almost persuaded\r\nmyself to weep over thy fall; but I am frail as dust, and mutable as\r\nwater; I am calm, I am compassionate only in thy absence.--Make this\r\nhouse, this room, thy abode as long as thou wilt, but forgive me if I\r\nprefer solitude for the short time during which I shall stay.\" Saying\r\nthis, he motioned as if to leave the apartment.\r\n\r\nThe stormy passions of this man affected me by sympathy. I ceased to\r\nweep. I was motionless and speechless with agony. I sat with my hands\r\nclasped, mutely gazing after him as he withdrew. I desired to detain\r\nhim, but was unable to make any effort for that purpose, till he had\r\npassed out of the room. I then uttered an involuntary and piercing\r\ncry--\"Pleyel! Art thou gone? Gone forever?\"\r\n\r\nAt this summons he hastily returned. He beheld me wild, pale, gasping\r\nfor breath, and my head already sinking on my bosom. A painful dizziness\r\nseized me, and I fainted away.\r\n\r\nWhen I recovered, I found myself stretched on a bed in the outer\r\napartment, and Pleyel, with two female servants standing beside it. All\r\nthe fury and scorn which the countenance of the former lately expressed,\r\nhad now disappeared, and was succeeded by the most tender anxiety. As\r\nsoon as he perceived that my senses were returned to me, he clasped his\r\nhands, and exclaimed, \"God be thanked! you are once more alive. I had\r\nalmost despaired of your recovery. I fear I have been precipitate and\r\nunjust. My senses must have been the victims of some inexplicable and\r\nmomentary phrenzy. Forgive me, I beseech you, forgive my reproaches. I\r\nwould purchase conviction of your purity, at the price of my existence\r\nhere and hereafter.\"\r\n\r\nHe once more, in a tone of the most fervent tenderness, besought me to\r\nbe composed, and then left me to the care of the women.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter XIII\r\n\r\n\r\nHere was wrought a surprizing change in my friend. What was it that\r\nhad shaken conviction so firm? Had any thing occurred during my fit,\r\nadequate to produce so total an alteration? My attendants informed me\r\nthat he had not left my apartment; that the unusual duration of my fit,\r\nand the failure, for a time, of all the means used for my recovery, had\r\nfilled him with grief and dismay. Did he regard the effect which his\r\nreproaches had produced as a proof of my sincerity?\r\n\r\nIn this state of mind, I little regarded my languors of body. I rose\r\nand requested an interview with him before my departure, on which I was\r\nresolved, notwithstanding his earnest solicitation to spend the night\r\nat his house. He complied with my request. The tenderness which he had\r\nlately betrayed, had now disappeared, and he once more relapsed into a\r\nchilling solemnity.\r\n\r\nI told him that I was preparing to return to my brother's; that I had\r\ncome hither to vindicate my innocence from the foul aspersions which he\r\nhad cast upon it. My pride had not taken refuge in silence or distance.\r\nI had not relied upon time, or the suggestion of his cooler thoughts, to\r\nconfute his charges. Conscious as I was that I was perfectly guiltless,\r\nand entertaining some value for his good opinion, I could not prevail\r\nupon myself to believe that my efforts to make my innocence manifest,\r\nwould be fruitless. Adverse appearances might be numerous and specious,\r\nbut they were unquestionably false. I was willing to believe him\r\nsincere, that he made no charges which he himself did not believe; but\r\nthese charges were destitute of truth. The grounds of his opinion were\r\nfallacious; and I desired an opportunity of detecting their fallacy.\r\nI entreated him to be explicit, and to give me a detail of what he had\r\nheard, and what he had seen.\r\n\r\nAt these words, my companion's countenance grew darker. He appeared\r\nto be struggling with his rage. He opened his lips to speak, but his\r\naccents died away ere they were formed. This conflict lasted for some\r\nminutes, but his fortitude was finally successful. He spoke as follows:\r\n\r\n\"I would fain put an end to this hateful scene: what I shall say, will\r\nbe breath idly and unprofitably consumed. The clearest narrative will\r\nadd nothing to your present knowledge. You are acquainted with the\r\ngrounds of my opinion, and yet you avow yourself innocent: Why then\r\nshould I rehearse these grounds? You are apprized of the character of\r\nCarwin: Why then should I enumerate the discoveries which I have made\r\nrespecting him? Yet, since it is your request; since, considering the\r\nlimitedness of human faculties, some error may possibly lurk in those\r\nappearances which I have witnessed, I will briefly relate what I know.\r\n\r\n\"Need I dwell upon the impressions which your conversation and\r\ndeportment originally made upon me? We parted in childhood; but our\r\nintercourse, by letter, was copious and uninterrupted. How fondly did I\r\nanticipate a meeting with one whom her letters had previously taught\r\nme to consider as the first of women, and how fully realized were the\r\nexpectations that I had formed!\r\n\r\n\"Here, said I, is a being, after whom sages may model their transcendent\r\nintelligence, and painters, their ideal beauty. Here is exemplified,\r\nthat union between intellect and form, which has hitherto existed only\r\nin the conceptions of the poet. I have watched your eyes; my attention\r\nhas hung upon your lips. I have questioned whether the enchantments of\r\nyour voice were more conspicuous in the intricacies of melody, or the\r\nemphasis of rhetoric. I have marked the transitions of your discourse,\r\nthe felicities of your expression, your refined argumentation, and\r\nglowing imagery; and been forced to acknowledge, that all delights were\r\nmeagre and contemptible, compared with those connected with the\r\naudience and sight of you. I have contemplated your principles, and been\r\nastonished at the solidity of their foundation, and the perfection of\r\ntheir structure. I have traced you to your home. I have viewed you in\r\nrelation to your servants, to your family, to your neighbours, and to\r\nthe world. I have seen by what skilful arrangements you facilitate\r\nthe performance of the most arduous and complicated duties; what daily\r\naccessions of strength your judicious discipline bestowed upon\r\nyour memory; what correctness and abundance of knowledge was daily\r\nexperienced by your unwearied application to books, and to writing.\r\nIf she that possesses so much in the bloom of youth, will go on\r\naccumulating her stores, what, said I, is the picture she will display\r\nat a mature age?\r\n\r\n\"You know not the accuracy of my observation. I was desirous that others\r\nshould profit by an example so rare. I therefore noted down, in writing,\r\nevery particular of your conduct. I was anxious to benefit by an\r\nopportunity so seldom afforded us. I laboured not to omit the slightest\r\nshade, or the most petty line in your portrait. Here there was no other\r\ntask incumbent on me but to copy; there was no need to exaggerate or\r\noverlook, in order to produce a more unexceptionable pattern. Here was\r\na combination of harmonies and graces, incapable of diminution or\r\naccession without injury to its completeness.\r\n\r\n\"I found no end and no bounds to my task. No display of a scene like\r\nthis could be chargeable with redundancy or superfluity. Even the colour\r\nof a shoe, the knot of a ribband, or your attitude in plucking a\r\nrose, were of moment to be recorded. Even the arrangements of your\r\nbreakfast-table and your toilet have been amply displayed.\r\n\r\n\"I know that mankind are more easily enticed to virtue by example than\r\nby precept. I know that the absoluteness of a model, when supplied by\r\ninvention, diminishes its salutary influence, since it is useless, we\r\nthink, to strive after that which we know to be beyond our reach. But\r\nthe picture which I drew was not a phantom; as a model, it was devoid\r\nof imperfection; and to aspire to that height which had been really\r\nattained, was by no means unreasonable. I had another and more\r\ninteresting object in view. One existed who claimed all my tenderness.\r\nHere, in all its parts, was a model worthy of assiduous study, and\r\nindefatigable imitation. I called upon her, as she wished to secure and\r\nenhance my esteem, to mould her thoughts, her words, her countenance,\r\nher actions, by this pattern.\r\n\r\n\"The task was exuberant of pleasure, and I was deeply engaged in it,\r\nwhen an imp of mischief was let loose in the form of Carwin. I admired\r\nhis powers and accomplishments. I did not wonder that they were admired\r\nby you. On the rectitude of your judgement, however, I relied to keep\r\nthis admiration within discreet and scrupulous bounds. I assured myself,\r\nthat the strangeness of his deportment, and the obscurity of his life,\r\nwould teach you caution. Of all errors, my knowledge of your character\r\ninformed me that this was least likely to befall you.\r\n\r\n\"You were powerfully affected by his first appearance; you were\r\nbewitched by his countenance and his tones; your description was ardent\r\nand pathetic: I listened to you with some emotions of surprize. The\r\nportrait you drew in his absence, and the intensity with which you mused\r\nupon it, were new and unexpected incidents. They bespoke a sensibility\r\nsomewhat too vivid; but from which, while subjected to the guidance of\r\nan understanding like yours, there was nothing to dread.\r\n\r\n\"A more direct intercourse took place between you. I need not apologize\r\nfor the solicitude which I entertained for your safety. He that gifted\r\nme with perception of excellence, compelled me to love it. In the midst\r\nof danger and pain, my contemplations have ever been cheered by your\r\nimage. Every object in competition with you, was worthless and trivial.\r\nNo price was too great by which your safety could be purchased. For\r\nthat end, the sacrifice of ease, of health, and even of life, would\r\ncheerfully have been made by me. What wonder then, that I scrutinized\r\nthe sentiments and deportment of this man with ceaseless vigilance;\r\nthat I watched your words and your looks when he was present; and that I\r\nextracted cause for the deepest inquietudes, from every token which you\r\ngave of having put your happiness into this man's keeping?\r\n\r\n\"I was cautious in deciding. I recalled the various conversations in\r\nwhich the topics of love and marriage had been discussed. As a woman,\r\nyoung, beautiful, and independent, it behoved you to have fortified\r\nyour mind with just principles on this subject. Your principles were\r\neminently just. Had not their rectitude and their firmness been attested\r\nby your treatment of that specious seducer Dashwood? These principles,\r\nI was prone to believe, exempted you from danger in this new state of\r\nthings. I was not the last to pay my homage to the unrivalled capacity,\r\ninsinuation, and eloquence of this man. I have disguised, but could\r\nnever stifle the conviction, that his eyes and voice had a witchcraft\r\nin them, which rendered him truly formidable: but I reflected on the\r\nambiguous expression of his countenance--an ambiguity which you were the\r\nfirst to remark; on the cloud which obscured his character; and on the\r\nsuspicious nature of that concealment which he studied; and concluded\r\nyou to be safe. I denied the obvious construction to appearances. I\r\nreferred your conduct to some principle which had not been hitherto\r\ndisclosed, but which was reconcileable with those already known.\r\n\r\n\"I was not suffered to remain long in this suspence. One evening, you\r\nmay recollect, I came to your house, where it was my purpose, as usual,\r\nto lodge, somewhat earlier than ordinary. I spied a light in your\r\nchamber as I approached from the outside, and on inquiring of Judith,\r\nwas informed that you were writing. As your kinsman and friend, and\r\nfellow-lodger, I thought I had a right to be familiar. You were in your\r\nchamber, but your employment and the time were such as to make it no\r\ninfraction of decorum to follow you thither. The spirit of mischievous\r\ngaiety possessed me. I proceeded on tiptoe. You did not perceive\r\nmy entrance; and I advanced softly till I was able to overlook your\r\nshoulder.\r\n\r\n\"I had gone thus far in error, and had no power to recede. How\r\ncautiously should we guard against the first inroads of temptation! I\r\nknew that to pry into your papers was criminal; but I reflected that\r\nno sentiment of yours was of a nature which made it your interest to\r\nconceal it. You wrote much more than you permitted your friends to\r\nperuse. My curiosity was strong, and I had only to throw a glance upon\r\nthe paper, to secure its gratification. I should never have deliberately\r\ncommitted an act like this. The slightest obstacle would have repelled\r\nme; but my eye glanced almost spontaneously upon the paper. I caught\r\nonly parts of sentences; but my eyes comprehended more at a glance,\r\nbecause the characters were short-hand. I lighted on the words\r\nSUMMER-HOUSE, MIDNIGHT, and made out a passage which spoke of the\r\npropriety and of the effects to be expected from ANOTHER interview.\r\nAll this passed in less than a moment. I then checked myself, and made\r\nmyself known to you, by a tap upon your shoulder.\r\n\r\n\"I could pardon and account for some trifling alarm; but your\r\ntrepidation and blushes were excessive. You hurried the paper out of\r\nsight, and seemed too anxious to discover whether I knew the contents to\r\nallow yourself to make any inquiries. I wondered at these appearances\r\nof consternation, but did not reason on them until I had retired. When\r\nalone, these incidents suggested themselves to my reflections anew.\r\n\r\n\"To what scene, or what interview, I asked, did you allude? Your\r\ndisappearance on a former evening, my tracing you to the recess in the\r\nbank, your silence on my first and second call, your vague answers and\r\ninvincible embarrassment, when you, at length, ascended the hill, I\r\nrecollected with new surprize. Could this be the summerhouse alluded to?\r\nA certain timidity and consciousness had generally attended you, when\r\nthis incident and this recess had been the subjects of conversation.\r\nNay, I imagined that the last time that adventure was mentioned, which\r\nhappened in the presence of Carwin, the countenance of the latter\r\nbetrayed some emotion. Could the interview have been with him?\r\n\r\n\"This was an idea calculated to rouse every faculty to contemplation.\r\nAn interview at that hour, in this darksome retreat, with a man of this\r\nmysterious but formidable character; a clandestine interview, and one\r\nwhich you afterwards endeavoured with so much solicitude to conceal! It\r\nwas a fearful and portentous occurrence. I could not measure his power,\r\nor fathom his designs. Had he rifled from you the secret of your love,\r\nand reconciled you to concealment and noctural meetings? I scarcely ever\r\nspent a night of more inquietude.\r\n\r\n\"I knew not how to act. The ascertainment of this man's character\r\nand views seemed to be, in the first place, necessary. Had he openly\r\npreferred his suit to you, we should have been impowered to make\r\ndirect inquiries; but since he had chosen this obscure path, it seemed\r\nreasonable to infer that his character was exceptionable. It, at\r\nleast, subjected us to the necessity of resorting to other means of\r\ninformation. Yet the improbability that you should commit a deed of such\r\nrashness, made me reflect anew upon the insufficiency of those grounds\r\non which my suspicions had been built, and almost to condemn myself for\r\nharbouring them.\r\n\r\n\"Though it was mere conjecture that the interview spoken of had taken\r\nplace with Carwin, yet two ideas occurred to involve me in the most\r\npainful doubts. This man's reasonings might be so specious, and\r\nhis artifices so profound, that, aided by the passion which you had\r\nconceived for him, he had finally succeeded; or his situation might be\r\nsuch as to justify the secrecy which you maintained. In neither case did\r\nmy wildest reveries suggest to me, that your honor had been forfeited.\r\n\r\n\"I could not talk with you on this subject. If the imputation was false,\r\nits atrociousness would have justly drawn upon me your resentment, and\r\nI must have explained by what facts it had been suggested. If it were\r\ntrue, no benefit would follow from the mention of it. You had chosen\r\nto conceal it for some reasons, and whether these reasons were true or\r\nfalse, it was proper to discover and remove them in the first place.\r\nFinally, I acquiesced in the least painful supposition, trammelled as it\r\nwas with perplexities, that Carwin was upright, and that, if the reasons\r\nof your silence were known, they would be found to be just.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter XIV\r\n\r\n\r\n\"Three days have elapsed since this occurrence. I have been haunted by\r\nperpetual inquietude. To bring myself to regard Carwin without terror,\r\nand to acquiesce in the belief of your safety, was impossible. Yet to\r\nput an end to my doubts, seemed to be impracticable. If some light could\r\nbe reflected on the actual situation of this man, a direct path would\r\npresent itself. If he were, contrary to the tenor of his conversation,\r\ncunning and malignant, to apprize you of this, would be to place you in\r\nsecurity. If he were merely unfortunate and innocent, most readily would\r\nI espouse his cause; and if his intentions were upright with regard to\r\nyou, most eagerly would I sanctify your choice by my approbation.\r\n\r\n\"It would be vain to call upon Carwin for an avowal of his deeds. It was\r\nbetter to know nothing, than to be deceived by an artful tale. What he\r\nwas unwilling to communicate, and this unwillingness had been repeatedly\r\nmanifested, could never be extorted from him. Importunity might be\r\nappeased, or imposture effected by fallacious representations. To the\r\nrest of the world he was unknown. I had often made him the subject of\r\ndiscourse; but a glimpse of his figure in the street was the sum of\r\ntheir knowledge who knew most. None had ever seen him before, and\r\nreceived as new, the information which my intercourse with him in\r\nValencia, and my present intercourse, enabled me to give.\r\n\r\n\"Wieland was your brother. If he had really made you the object of his\r\ncourtship, was not a brother authorized to interfere and demand from him\r\nthe confession of his views? Yet what were the grounds on which I had\r\nreared this supposition? Would they justify a measure like this? Surely\r\nnot.\r\n\r\n\"In the course of my restless meditations, it occurred to me, at length,\r\nthat my duty required me to speak to you, to confess the indecorum of\r\nwhich I had been guilty, and to state the reflections to which it had\r\nled me. I was prompted by no mean or selfish views. The heart within my\r\nbreast was not more precious than your safety: most cheerfully would\r\nI have interposed my life between you and danger. Would you cherish\r\nresentment at my conduct? When acquainted with the motive which\r\nproduced it, it would not only exempt me from censure, but entitle me to\r\ngratitude.\r\n\r\n\"Yesterday had been selected for the rehearsal of the newly-imported\r\ntragedy. I promised to be present. The state of my thoughts but little\r\nqualified me for a performer or auditor in such a scene; but I reflected\r\nthat, after it was finished, I should return home with you, and should\r\nthen enjoy an opportunity of discoursing with you fully on this topic.\r\nMy resolution was not formed without a remnant of doubt, as to its\r\npropriety. When I left this house to perform the visit I had promised,\r\nmy mind was full of apprehension and despondency. The dubiousness of\r\nthe event of our conversation, fear that my interference was too late to\r\nsecure your peace, and the uncertainty to which hope gave birth, whether\r\nI had not erred in believing you devoted to this man, or, at least, in\r\nimagining that he had obtained your consent to midnight conferences,\r\ndistracted me with contradictory opinions, and repugnant emotions.\r\n\r\n\"I can assign no reason for calling at Mrs. Baynton's. I had seen her\r\nin the morning, and knew her to be well. The concerted hour had nearly\r\narrived, and yet I turned up the street which leads to her house, and\r\ndismounted at her door. I entered the parlour and threw myself in a\r\nchair. I saw and inquired for no one. My whole frame was overpowered\r\nby dreary and comfortless sensations. One idea possessed me wholly;\r\nthe inexpressible importance of unveiling the designs and character of\r\nCarwin, and the utter improbability that this ever would be effected.\r\nSome instinct induced me to lay my hand upon a newspaper. I had perused\r\nall the general intelligence it contained in the morning, and at the\r\nsame spot. The act was rather mechanical than voluntary.\r\n\r\n\"I threw a languid glance at the first column that presented itself.\r\nThe first words which I read, began with the offer of a reward of three\r\nhundred guineas for the apprehension of a convict under sentence of\r\ndeath, who had escaped from Newgate prison in Dublin. Good heaven! how\r\nevery fibre of my frame tingled when I proceeded to read that the name\r\nof the criminal was Francis Carwin!\r\n\r\n\"The descriptions of his person and address were minute. His stature,\r\nhair, complexion, the extraordinary position and arrangement of his\r\nfeatures, his aukward and disproportionate form, his gesture and gait,\r\ncorresponded perfectly with those of our mysterious visitant. He had\r\nbeen found guilty in two indictments. One for the murder of the Lady\r\nJane Conway, and the other for a robbery committed on the person of the\r\nhonorable Mr. Ludloe.\r\n\r\n\"I repeatedly perused this passage. The ideas which flowed in upon my\r\nmind, affected me like an instant transition from death to life. The\r\npurpose dearest to my heart was thus effected, at a time and by means\r\nthe least of all others within the scope of my foresight. But what\r\npurpose? Carwin was detected. Acts of the blackest and most sordid\r\nguilt had been committed by him. Here was evidence which imparted to\r\nmy understanding the most luminous certainty. The name, visage, and\r\ndeportment, were the same. Between the time of his escape, and his\r\nappearance among us, there was a sufficient agreement. Such was the\r\nman with whom I suspected you to maintain a clandestine correspondence.\r\nShould I not haste to snatch you from the talons of this vulture? Should\r\nI see you rushing to the verge of a dizzy precipice, and not stretch\r\nforth a hand to pull you back? I had no need to deliberate. I thrust the\r\npaper in my pocket, and resolved to obtain an immediate conference with\r\nyou. For a time, no other image made its way to my understanding. At\r\nlength, it occurred to me, that though the information I possessed\r\nwas, in one sense, sufficient, yet if more could be obtained, more was\r\ndesirable. This passage was copied from a British paper; part of it\r\nonly, perhaps, was transcribed. The printer was in possession of the\r\noriginal.\r\n\r\n\"Towards his house I immediately turned my horse's head. He produced the\r\npaper, but I found nothing more than had already been seen. While busy\r\nin perusing it, the printer stood by my side. He noticed the object\r\nof which I was in search. \"Aye,\" said he, \"that is a strange affair. I\r\nshould never have met with it, had not Mr. Hallet sent to me the paper,\r\nwith a particular request to republish that advertisement.\"\r\n\r\n\"Mr. Hallet! What reasons could he have for making this request? Had\r\nthe paper sent to him been accompanied by any information respecting\r\nthe convict? Had he personal or extraordinary reasons for desiring its\r\nrepublication? This was to be known only in one way. I speeded to\r\nhis house. In answer to my interrogations, he told me that Ludloe had\r\nformerly been in America, and that during his residence in this\r\ncity, considerable intercourse had taken place between them. Hence a\r\nconfidence arose, which has since been kept alive by occasional letters.\r\nHe had lately received a letter from him, enclosing the newspaper from\r\nwhich this extract had been made. He put it into my hands, and pointed\r\nout the passages which related to Carwin.\r\n\r\n\"Ludloe confirms the facts of his conviction and escape; and adds, that\r\nhe had reason to believe him to have embarked for America. He describes\r\nhim in general terms, as the most incomprehensible and formidable among\r\nmen; as engaged in schemes, reasonably suspected to be, in the highest\r\ndegree, criminal, but such as no human intelligence is able to unravel:\r\nthat his ends are pursued by means which leave it in doubt whether he be\r\nnot in league with some infernal spirit: that his crimes have hitherto\r\nbeen perpetrated with the aid of some unknown but desperate accomplices:\r\nthat he wages a perpetual war against the happiness of mankind, and sets\r\nhis engines of destruction at work against every object that presents\r\nitself.\r\n\r\n\"This is the substance of the letter. Hallet expressed some surprize\r\nat the curiosity which was manifested by me on this occasion. I was too\r\nmuch absorbed by the ideas suggested by this letter, to pay attention to\r\nhis remarks. I shuddered with the apprehension of the evil to which our\r\nindiscreet familiarity with this man had probably exposed us. I burnt\r\nwith impatience to see you, and to do what in me lay to avert the\r\ncalamity which threatened us. It was already five o'clock. Night was\r\nhastening, and there was no time to be lost. On leaving Mr. Hallet's\r\nhouse, who should meet me in the street, but Bertrand, the servant whom\r\nI left in Germany. His appearance and accoutrements bespoke him to have\r\njust alighted from a toilsome and long journey. I was not wholly without\r\nexpectation of seeing him about this time, but no one was then more\r\ndistant from my thoughts. You know what reasons I have for anxiety\r\nrespecting scenes with which this man was conversant. Carwin was for a\r\nmoment forgotten. In answer to my vehement inquiries, Bertrand produced\r\na copious packet. I shall not at present mention its contents, nor the\r\nmeasures which they obliged me to adopt. I bestowed a brief perusal on\r\nthese papers, and having given some directions to Bertrand, resumed\r\nmy purpose with regard to you. My horse I was obliged to resign to my\r\nservant, he being charged with a commission that required speed. The\r\nclock had struck ten, and Mettingen was five miles distant. I was\r\nto Journey thither on foot. These circumstances only added to my\r\nexpedition.\r\n\r\n\"As I passed swiftly along, I reviewed all the incidents accompanying\r\nthe appearance and deportment of that man among us. Late events have\r\nbeen inexplicable and mysterious beyond any of which I have either read\r\nor heard. These events were coeval with Carwin's introduction. I am\r\nunable to explain their origin and mutual dependance; but I do not, on\r\nthat account, believe them to have a supernatural origin. Is not this\r\nman the agent? Some of them seem to be propitious; but what should\r\nI think of those threats of assassination with which you were lately\r\nalarmed? Bloodshed is the trade, and horror is the element of this man.\r\nThe process by which the sympathies of nature are extinguished in\r\nour hearts, by which evil is made our good, and by which we are made\r\nsusceptible of no activity but in the infliction, and no joy but in the\r\nspectacle of woes, is an obvious process. As to an alliance with evil\r\ngeniuses, the power and the malice of daemons have been a thousand times\r\nexemplified in human beings. There are no devils but those which are\r\nbegotten upon selfishness, and reared by cunning.\r\n\r\n\"Now, indeed, the scene was changed. It was not his secret poniard\r\nthat I dreaded. It was only the success of his efforts to make you a\r\nconfederate in your own destruction, to make your will the instrument by\r\nwhich he might bereave you of liberty and honor.\r\n\r\n\"I took, as usual, the path through your brother's ground. I ranged\r\nwith celerity and silence along the bank. I approached the fence, which\r\ndivides Wieland's estate from yours. The recess in the bank being near\r\nthis line, it being necessary for me to pass near it, my mind being\r\ntainted with inveterate suspicions concerning you; suspicions which were\r\nindebted for their strength to incidents connected with this spot; what\r\nwonder that it seized upon my thoughts! \"I leaped on the fence; but\r\nbefore I descended on the opposite side, I paused to survey the scene.\r\nLeaves dropping with dew, and glistening in the moon's rays, with no\r\nmoving object to molest the deep repose, filled me with security\r\nand hope. I left the station at length, and tended forward. You were\r\nprobably at rest. How should I communicate without alarming you, the\r\nintelligence of my arrival? An immediate interview was to be procured.\r\nI could not bear to think that a minute should be lost by remissness\r\nor hesitation. Should I knock at the door? or should I stand under your\r\nchamber windows, which I perceived to be open, and awaken you by my\r\ncalls?\r\n\r\n\"These reflections employed me, as I passed opposite to the\r\nsummer-house. I had scarcely gone by, when my ear caught a sound unusual\r\nat this time and place. It was almost too faint and too transient to\r\nallow me a distinct perception of it. I stopped to listen; presently\r\nit was heard again, and now it was somewhat in a louder key. It was\r\nlaughter; and unquestionably produced by a female voice. That voice was\r\nfamiliar to my senses. It was yours.\r\n\r\n\"Whence it came, I was at first at a loss to conjecture; but this\r\nuncertainty vanished when it was heard the third time. I threw back my\r\neyes towards the recess. Every other organ and limb was useless to me.\r\nI did not reason on the subject. I did not, in a direct manner, draw\r\nmy conclusions from the hour, the place, the hilarity which this sound\r\nbetokened, and the circumstance of having a companion, which it no less\r\nincontestably proved. In an instant, as it were, my heart was invaded\r\nwith cold, and the pulses of life at a stand.\r\n\r\n\"Why should I go further? Why should I return? Should I not hurry to a\r\ndistance from a sound, which, though formerly so sweet and delectable,\r\nwas now more hideous than the shrieks of owls?\r\n\r\n\"I had no time to yield to this impulse. The thought of approaching and\r\nlistening occurred to me. I had no doubt of which I was conscious. Yet\r\nmy certainty was capable of increase. I was likewise stimulated by a\r\nsentiment that partook of rage. I was governed by an half-formed and\r\ntempestuous resolution to break in upon your interview, and strike you\r\ndead with my upbraiding.\r\n\r\n\"I approached with the utmost caution. When I reached the edge of the\r\nbank immediately above the summer-house, I thought I heard voices from\r\nbelow, as busy in conversation. The steps in the rock are clear of\r\nbushy impediments. They allowed me to descend into a cavity beside\r\nthe building without being detected. Thus to lie in wait could only be\r\njustified by the momentousness of the occasion.\"\r\n\r\nHere Pleyel paused in his narrative, and fixed his eyes upon me.\r\nSituated as I was, my horror and astonishment at this tale gave way to\r\ncompassion for the anguish which the countenance of my friend betrayed.\r\nI reflected on his force of understanding. I reflected on the powers of\r\nmy enemy. I could easily divine the substance of the conversation that\r\nwas overheard. Carwin had constructed his plot in a manner suited to the\r\ncharacters of those whom he had selected for his victims. I saw that the\r\nconvictions of Pleyel were immutable. I forbore to struggle against the\r\nstorm, because I saw that all struggles would be fruitless. I was calm;\r\nbut my calmness was the torpor of despair, and not the tranquillity of\r\nfortitude. It was calmness invincible by any thing that his grief and\r\nhis fury could suggest to Pleyel. He resumed--\r\n\r\n\"Woman! wilt thou hear me further? Shall I go on to repeat the\r\nconversation? Is it shame that makes thee tongue-tied? Shall I go on? or\r\nart thou satisfied with what has been already said?\"\r\n\r\nI bowed my head. \"Go on,\" said I. \"I make not this request in the hope\r\nof undeceiving you. I shall no longer contend with my own weakness. The\r\nstorm is let loose, and I shall peaceably submit to be driven by its\r\nfury. But go on. This conference will end only with affording me a\r\nclearer foresight of my destiny; but that will be some satisfaction, and\r\nI will not part without it.\"\r\n\r\nWhy, on hearing these words, did Pleyel hesitate? Did some unlooked-for\r\ndoubt insinuate itself into his mind? Was his belief suddenly shaken\r\nby my looks, or my words, or by some newly recollected circumstance?\r\nWhencesoever it arose, it could not endure the test of deliberation. In\r\na few minutes the flame of resentment was again lighted up in his bosom.\r\nHe proceeded with his accustomed vehemence--\r\n\r\n\"I hate myself for this folly. I can find no apology for this tale. Yet\r\nI am irresistibly impelled to relate it. She that hears me is apprized\r\nof every particular. I have only to repeat to her her own words. She\r\nwill listen with a tranquil air, and the spectacle of her obduracy will\r\ndrive me to some desperate act. Why then should I persist! yet persist I\r\nmust.\"\r\n\r\nAgain he paused. \"No,\" said he, \"it is impossible to repeat your avowals\r\nof love, your appeals to former confessions of your tenderness, to\r\nformer deeds of dishonor, to the circumstances of the first interview\r\nthat took place between you. It was on that night when I traced you to\r\nthis recess. Thither had he enticed you, and there had you ratified an\r\nunhallowed compact by admitting him--\r\n\r\n\"Great God! Thou witnessedst the agonies that tore my bosom at that\r\nmoment! Thou witnessedst my efforts to repel the testimony of my ears!\r\nIt was in vain that you dwelt upon the confusion which my unlooked-for\r\nsummons excited in you; the tardiness with which a suitable excuse\r\noccurred to you; your resentment that my impertinent intrusion had\r\nput an end to that charming interview: A disappointment for which you\r\nendeavoured to compensate yourself, by the frequency and duration of\r\nsubsequent meetings.\r\n\r\n\"In vain you dwelt upon incidents of which you only could be conscious;\r\nincidents that occurred on occasions on which none beside your own\r\nfamily were witnesses. In vain was your discourse characterized by\r\npeculiarities inimitable of sentiment and language. My conviction was\r\neffected only by an accumulation of the same tokens. I yielded not but\r\nto evidence which took away the power to withhold my faith.\r\n\r\n\"My sight was of no use to me. Beneath so thick an umbrage, the darkness\r\nwas intense. Hearing was the only avenue to information, which the\r\ncircumstances allowed to be open. I was couched within three feet\r\nof you. Why should I approach nearer? I could not contend with your\r\nbetrayer. What could be the purpose of a contest? You stood in no need\r\nof a protector. What could I do, but retire from the spot overwhelmed\r\nwith confusion and dismay? I sought my chamber, and endeavoured to\r\nregain my composure. The door of the house, which I found open, your\r\nsubsequent entrance, closing, and fastening it, and going into your\r\nchamber, which had been thus long deserted, were only confirmations of\r\nthe truth.\r\n\r\n\"Why should I paint the tempestuous fluctuation of my thoughts between\r\ngrief and revenge, between rage and despair? Why should I repeat my vows\r\nof eternal implacability and persecution, and the speedy recantation of\r\nthese vows?\r\n\r\n\"I have said enough. You have dismissed me from a place in your esteem.\r\nWhat I think, and what I feel, is of no importance in your eyes. May\r\nthe duty which I owe myself enable me to forget your existence. In a\r\nfew minutes I go hence. Be the maker of your fortune, and may adversity\r\ninstruct you in that wisdom, which education was unable to impart to\r\nyou.\"\r\n\r\nThose were the last words which Pleyel uttered. He left the room, and\r\nmy new emotions enabled me to witness his departure without any apparent\r\nloss of composure. As I sat alone, I ruminated on these incidents.\r\nNothing was more evident than that I had taken an eternal leave of\r\nhappiness. Life was a worthless thing, separate from that good which had\r\nnow been wrested from me; yet the sentiment that now possessed me had no\r\ntendency to palsy my exertions, and overbear my strength. I noticed that\r\nthe light was declining, and perceived the propriety of leaving this\r\nhouse. I placed myself again in the chaise, and returned slowly towards\r\nthe city.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter XV\r\n\r\n\r\nBefore I reached the city it was dusk. It was my purpose to spend the\r\nnight at Mettingen. I was not solicitous, as long as I was attended by\r\na faithful servant, to be there at an early hour. My exhausted strength\r\nrequired me to take some refreshment. With this view, and in order to\r\npay respect to one whose affection for me was truly maternal, I stopped\r\nat Mrs. Baynton's. She was absent from home; but I had scarcely entered\r\nthe house when one of her domestics presented me a letter. I opened and\r\nread as follows:\r\n\r\n\r\n\"To Clara Wieland,\r\n\r\n\"What shall I say to extenuate the misconduct of last night? It is my\r\nduty to repair it to the utmost of my power, but the only way in which\r\nit can be repaired, you will not, I fear, be prevailed on to adopt. It\r\nis by granting me an interview, at your own house, at eleven o'clock\r\nthis night. I have no means of removing any fears that you may entertain\r\nof my designs, but my simple and solemn declarations. These, after what\r\nhas passed between us, you may deem unworthy of confidence. I cannot\r\nhelp it. My folly and rashness has left me no other resource. I will\r\nbe at your door by that hour. If you chuse to admit me to a conference,\r\nprovided that conference has no witnesses, I will disclose to you\r\nparticulars, the knowledge of which is of the utmost importance to your\r\nhappiness. Farewell.\r\n\r\n\"CARWIN.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat a letter was this! A man known to be an assassin and robber; one\r\ncapable of plotting against my life and my fame; detected lurking in\r\nmy chamber, and avowing designs the most flagitious and dreadful, now\r\nsolicits me to grant him a midnight interview! To admit him alone into\r\nmy presence! Could he make this request with the expectation of my\r\ncompliance? What had he seen in me, that could justify him in admitting\r\nso wild a belief? Yet this request is preferred with the utmost gravity.\r\nIt is not accompanied by an appearance of uncommon earnestness. Had\r\nthe misconduct to which he alludes been a slight incivility, and the\r\ninterview requested to take place in the midst of my friends, there\r\nwould have been no extravagance in the tenor of this letter; but, as it\r\nwas, the writer had surely been bereft of his reason.\r\n\r\nI perused this epistle frequently. The request it contained might be\r\ncalled audacious or stupid, if it had been made by a different person;\r\nbut from Carwin, who could not be unaware of the effect which it must\r\nnaturally produce, and of the manner in which it would unavoidably be\r\ntreated, it was perfectly inexplicable. He must have counted on the\r\nsuccess of some plot, in order to extort my assent. None of those\r\nmotives by which I am usually governed would ever have persuaded me to\r\nmeet any one of his sex, at the time and place which he had prescribed.\r\nMuch less would I consent to a meeting with a man, tainted with the\r\nmost detestable crimes, and by whose arts my own safety had been so\r\nimminently endangered, and my happiness irretrievably destroyed. I\r\nshuddered at the idea that such a meeting was possible. I felt some\r\nreluctance to approach a spot which he still visited and haunted.\r\n\r\nSuch were the ideas which first suggested themselves on the perusal of\r\nthe letter. Meanwhile, I resumed my journey. My thoughts still dwelt\r\nupon the same topic. Gradually from ruminating on this epistle, I\r\nreverted to my interview with Pleyel. I recalled the particulars of the\r\ndialogue to which he had been an auditor. My heart sunk anew on viewing\r\nthe inextricable complexity of this deception, and the inauspicious\r\nconcurrence of events, which tended to confirm him in his error. When\r\nhe approached my chamber door, my terror kept me mute. He put his ear,\r\nperhaps, to the crevice, but it caught the sound of nothing human. Had\r\nI called, or made any token that denoted some one to be within, words\r\nwould have ensued; and as omnipresence was impossible, this discovery,\r\nand the artless narrative of what had just passed, would have saved me\r\nfrom his murderous invectives. He went into his chamber, and after some\r\ninterval, I stole across the entry and down the stairs, with\r\ninaudible steps. Having secured the outer doors, I returned with less\r\ncircumspection. He heard me not when I descended; but my returning steps\r\nwere easily distinguished. Now he thought was the guilty interview at\r\nan end. In what other way was it possible for him to construe these\r\nsignals?\r\n\r\nHow fallacious and precipitate was my decision! Carwin's plot owed its\r\nsuccess to a coincidence of events scarcely credible. The balance was\r\nswayed from its equipoise by a hair. Had I even begun the conversation\r\nwith an account of what befel me in my chamber, my previous interview\r\nwith Wieland would have taught him to suspect me of imposture; yet, if\r\nI were discoursing with this ruffian, when Pleyel touched the lock of my\r\nchamber door, and when he shut his own door with so much violence, how,\r\nhe might ask, should I be able to relate these incidents? Perhaps he\r\nhad withheld the knowledge of these circumstances from my brother, from\r\nwhom, therefore, I could not obtain it, so that my innocence would have\r\nthus been irresistibly demonstrated.\r\n\r\nThe first impulse which flowed from these ideas was to return upon my\r\nsteps, and demand once more an interview; but he was gone: his parting\r\ndeclarations were remembered.\r\n\r\nPleyel, I exclaimed, thou art gone for ever! Are thy mistakes beyond\r\nthe reach of detection? Am I helpless in the midst of this snare?\r\nThe plotter is at hand. He even speaks in the style of penitence. He\r\nsolicits an interview which he promises shall end in the disclosure of\r\nsomething momentous to my happiness. What can he say which will avail to\r\nturn aside this evil? But why should his remorse be feigned? I have\r\ndone him no injury. His wickedness is fertile only of despair; and the\r\nbillows of remorse will some time overbear him. Why may not this event\r\nhave already taken place? Why should I refuse to see him?\r\n\r\nThis idea was present, as it were, for a moment. I suddenly recoiled\r\nfrom it, confounded at that frenzy which could give even momentary\r\nharbour to such a scheme; yet presently it returned. At length I even\r\nconceived it to deserve deliberation. I questioned whether it was\r\nnot proper to admit, at a lonely spot, in a sacred hour, this man of\r\ntremendous and inscrutable attributes, this performer of horrid deeds,\r\nand whose presence was predicted to call down unheard-of and unutterable\r\nhorrors.\r\n\r\nWhat was it that swayed me? I felt myself divested of the power to will\r\ncontrary to the motives that determined me to seek his presence. My mind\r\nseemed to be split into separate parts, and these parts to have\r\nentered into furious and implacable contention. These tumults gradually\r\nsubsided. The reasons why I should confide in that interposition which\r\nhad hitherto defended me; in those tokens of compunction which this\r\nletter contained; in the efficacy of this interview to restore its\r\nspotlessness to my character, and banish all illusions from the mind of\r\nmy friend, continually acquired new evidence and new strength.\r\n\r\nWhat should I fear in his presence? This was unlike an artifice intended\r\nto betray me into his hands. If it were an artifice, what purpose would\r\nit serve? The freedom of my mind was untouched, and that freedom would\r\ndefy the assaults of blandishments or magic. Force was I not able to\r\nrepel. On the former occasion my courage, it is true, had failed at the\r\nimminent approach of danger; but then I had not enjoyed opportunities of\r\ndeliberation; I had foreseen nothing; I was sunk into imbecility by my\r\nprevious thoughts; I had been the victim of recent disappointments\r\nand anticipated ills: Witness my infatuation in opening the closet in\r\nopposition to divine injunctions.\r\n\r\nNow, perhaps, my courage was the offspring of a no less erring\r\nprinciple. Pleyel was for ever lost to me. I strove in vain to assume\r\nhis person, and suppress my resentment; I strove in vain to believe in\r\nthe assuaging influence of time, to look forward to the birth-day of new\r\nhopes, and the re-exaltation of that luminary, of whose effulgencies I\r\nhad so long and so liberally partaken.\r\n\r\nWhat had I to suffer worse than was already inflicted?\r\n\r\nWas not Carwin my foe? I owed my untimely fate to his treason. Instead\r\nof flying from his presence, ought I not to devote all my faculties to\r\nthe gaining of an interview, and compel him to repair the ills of\r\nwhich he has been the author? Why should I suppose him impregnable\r\nto argument? Have I not reason on my side, and the power of imparting\r\nconviction? Cannot he be made to see the justice of unravelling the maze\r\nin which Pleyel is bewildered?\r\n\r\nHe may, at least, be accessible to fear. Has he nothing to fear from\r\nthe rage of an injured woman? But suppose him inaccessible to such\r\ninducements; suppose him to persist in all his flagitious purposes; are\r\nnot the means of defence and resistance in my power?\r\n\r\nIn the progress of such thoughts, was the resolution at last formed. I\r\nhoped that the interview was sought by him for a laudable end; but, be\r\nthat as it would, I trusted that, by energy of reasoning or of action, I\r\nshould render it auspicious, or, at least, harmless.\r\n\r\nSuch a determination must unavoidably fluctuate. The poet's chaos was\r\nno unapt emblem of the state of my mind. A torment was awakened in my\r\nbosom, which I foresaw would end only when this interview was past, and\r\nits consequences fully experienced. Hence my impatience for the arrival\r\nof the hour which had been prescribed by Carwin.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, my meditations were tumultuously active. New impediments\r\nto the execution of the scheme were speedily suggested. I had apprized\r\nCatharine of my intention to spend this and many future nights with her.\r\nHer husband was informed of this arrangement, and had zealously approved\r\nit. Eleven o'clock exceeded their hour of retiring. What excuse should\r\nI form for changing my plan? Should I shew this letter to Wieland, and\r\nsubmit myself to his direction? But I knew in what way he would decide.\r\nHe would fervently dissuade me from going. Nay, would he not do more?\r\nHe was apprized of the offences of Carwin, and of the reward offered\r\nfor his apprehension. Would he not seize this opportunity of executing\r\njustice on a criminal?\r\n\r\nThis idea was new. I was plunged once more into doubt. Did not equity\r\nenjoin me thus to facilitate his arrest? No. I disdained the office of\r\nbetrayer. Carwin was unapprized of his danger, and his intentions were\r\npossibly beneficent. Should I station guards about the house, and\r\nmake an act, intended perhaps for my benefit, instrumental to his own\r\ndestruction? Wieland might be justified in thus employing the knowledge\r\nwhich I should impart, but I, by imparting it, should pollute myself\r\nwith more hateful crimes than those undeservedly imputed to me. This\r\nscheme, therefore, I unhesitatingly rejected. The views with which\r\nI should return to my own house, it would therefore be necessary to\r\nconceal. Yet some pretext must be invented. I had never been initiated\r\ninto the trade of lying. Yet what but falshood was a deliberate\r\nsuppression of the truth? To deceive by silence or by words is the same.\r\n\r\nYet what would a lie avail me? What pretext would justify this change in\r\nmy plan? Would it not tend to confirm the imputations of Pleyel? That\r\nI should voluntarily return to an house in which honor and life had so\r\nlately been endangered, could be explained in no way favorable to my\r\nintegrity.\r\n\r\nThese reflections, if they did not change, at least suspended my\r\ndecision. In this state of uncertainty I alighted at the HUT. We gave\r\nthis name to the house tenanted by the farmer and his servants, and\r\nwhich was situated on the verge of my brother's ground, and at a\r\nconsiderable distance from the mansion. The path to the mansion was\r\nplanted by a double row of walnuts. Along this path I proceeded alone.\r\nI entered the parlour, in which was a light just expiring in the socket.\r\nThere was no one in the room. I perceived by the clock that stood\r\nagainst the wall, that it was near eleven. The lateness of the hour\r\nstartled me. What had become of the family? They were usually retired\r\nan hour before this; but the unextinguished taper, and the unbarred\r\ndoor were indications that they had not retired. I again returned to the\r\nhall, and passed from one room to another, but still encountered not a\r\nhuman being.\r\n\r\nI imagined that, perhaps, the lapse of a few minutes would explain\r\nthese appearances. Meanwhile I reflected that the preconcerted hour had\r\narrived. Carwin was perhaps waiting my approach. Should I immediately\r\nretire to my own house, no one would be apprized of my proceeding. Nay,\r\nthe interview might pass, and I be enabled to return in half an hour.\r\nHence no necessity would arise for dissimulation.\r\n\r\nI was so far influenced by these views that I rose to execute this\r\ndesign; but again the unusual condition of the house occurred to me, and\r\nsome vague solicitude as to the condition of the family. I was nearly\r\ncertain that my brother had not retired; but by what motives he could\r\nbe induced to desert his house thus unseasonably I could by no means\r\ndivine. Louisa Conway, at least, was at home and had, probably, retired\r\nto her chamber; perhaps she was able to impart the information I wanted.\r\n\r\nI went to her chamber, and found her asleep. She was delighted and\r\nsurprized at my arrival, and told me with how much impatience and\r\nanxiety my brother and his wife had waited my coming. They were fearful\r\nthat some mishap had befallen me, and had remained up longer than the\r\nusual period. Notwithstanding the lateness of the hour, Catharine would\r\nnot resign the hope of seeing me. Louisa said she had left them both in\r\nthe parlour, and she knew of no cause for their absence.\r\n\r\nAs yet I was not without solicitude on account of their personal safety.\r\nI was far from being perfectly at ease on that head, but entertained no\r\ndistinct conception of the danger that impended over them. Perhaps to\r\nbeguile the moments of my long protracted stay, they had gone to\r\nwalk upon the bank. The atmosphere, though illuminated only by the\r\nstar-light, was remarkably serene. Meanwhile the desirableness of an\r\ninterview with Carwin again returned, and I finally resolved to seek it.\r\n\r\nI passed with doubting and hasty steps along the path. My dwelling, seen\r\nat a distance, was gloomy and desolate. It had no inhabitant, for my\r\nservant, in consequence of my new arrangement, had gone to Mettingen.\r\nThe temerity of this attempt began to shew itself in more vivid colours\r\nto my understanding. Whoever has pointed steel is not without arms; yet\r\nwhat must have been the state of my mind when I could meditate, without\r\nshuddering, on the use of a murderous weapon, and believe myself secure\r\nmerely because I was capable of being made so by the death of another?\r\nYet this was not my state. I felt as if I was rushing into deadly toils,\r\nwithout the power of pausing or receding.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter XVI\r\n\r\n\r\nAs soon as I arrived in sight of the front of the house, my attention\r\nwas excited by a light from the window of my own chamber. No appearance\r\ncould be less explicable. A meeting was expected with Carwin, but that\r\nhe pre-occupied my chamber, and had supplied himself with light, was not\r\nto be believed. What motive could influence him to adopt this conduct?\r\nCould I proceed until this was explained? Perhaps, if I should proceed\r\nto a distance in front, some one would be visible. A sidelong but feeble\r\nbeam from the window, fell upon the piny copse which skirted the bank.\r\nAs I eyed it, it suddenly became mutable, and after flitting to and fro,\r\nfor a short time, it vanished. I turned my eye again toward the window,\r\nand perceived that the light was still there; but the change which I had\r\nnoticed was occasioned by a change in the position of the lamp or candle\r\nwithin. Hence, that some person was there was an unavoidable inference.\r\n\r\nI paused to deliberate on the propriety of advancing. Might I not\r\nadvance cautiously, and, therefore, without danger? Might I not knock at\r\nthe door, or call, and be apprized of the nature of my visitant before I\r\nentered? I approached and listened at the door, but could hear nothing.\r\nI knocked at first timidly, but afterwards with loudness. My signals\r\nwere unnoticed. I stepped back and looked, but the light was no longer\r\ndiscernible. Was it suddenly extinguished by a human agent? What purpose\r\nbut concealment was intended? Why was the illumination produced, to be\r\nthus suddenly brought to an end? And why, since some one was there, had\r\nsilence been observed?\r\n\r\nThese were questions, the solution of which may be readily supposed\r\nto be entangled with danger. Would not this danger, when measured by a\r\nwoman's fears, expand into gigantic dimensions? Menaces of death; the\r\nstunning exertions of a warning voice; the known and unknown attributes\r\nof Carwin; our recent interview in this chamber; the pre-appointment of\r\na meeting at this place and hour, all thronged into my memory. What was\r\nto be done?\r\n\r\nCourage is no definite or stedfast principle. Let that man who shall\r\npurpose to assign motives to the actions of another, blush at his\r\nfolly and forbear. Not more presumptuous would it be to attempt the\r\nclassification of all nature, and the scanning of supreme intelligence.\r\nI gazed for a minute at the window, and fixed my eyes, for a second\r\nminute, on the ground. I drew forth from my pocket, and opened, a\r\npenknife. This, said I, be my safe-guard and avenger. The assailant\r\nshall perish, or myself shall fall. I had locked up the house in the\r\nmorning, but had the key of the kitchen door in my pocket. I, therefore,\r\ndetermined to gain access behind. Thither I hastened, unlocked and\r\nentered. All was lonely, darksome, and waste. Familiar as I was with\r\nevery part of my dwelling, I easily found my way to a closet, drew forth\r\na taper, a flint, tinder, and steel, and, in a moment as it were, gave\r\nmyself the guidance and protection of light.\r\n\r\nWhat purpose did I meditate? Should I explore my way to my chamber, and\r\nconfront the being who had dared to intrude into this recess, and had\r\nlaboured for concealment? By putting out the light did he seek to hide\r\nhimself, or mean only to circumvent my incautious steps? Yet was it\r\nnot more probable that he desired my absence by thus encouraging the\r\nsupposition that the house was unoccupied? I would see this man in spite\r\nof all impediments; ere I died, I would see his face, and summon him\r\nto penitence and retribution; no matter at what cost an interview was\r\npurchased. Reputation and life might be wrested from me by another, but\r\nmy rectitude and honor were in my own keeping, and were safe.\r\n\r\nI proceeded to the foot of the stairs. At such a crisis my thoughts\r\nmay be supposed at no liberty to range; yet vague images rushed into my\r\nmind, of the mysterious interposition which had been experienced on the\r\nlast night. My case, at present, was not dissimilar; and, if my angel\r\nwere not weary of fruitless exertions to save, might not a new warning\r\nbe expected? Who could say whether his silence were ascribable to the\r\nabsence of danger, or to his own absence?\r\n\r\nIn this state of mind, no wonder that a shivering cold crept through\r\nmy veins; that my pause was prolonged; and, that a fearful glance was\r\nthrown backward.\r\n\r\nAlas! my heart droops, and my fingers are enervated; my ideas are\r\nvivid, but my language is faint: now know I what it is to entertain\r\nincommunicable sentiments. The chain of subsequent incidents is drawn\r\nthrough my mind, and being linked with those which forewent, by turns\r\nrouse up agonies and sink me into hopelessness.\r\n\r\nYet I will persist to the end. My narrative may be invaded by inaccuracy\r\nand confusion; but if I live no longer, I will, at least, live to\r\ncomplete it. What but ambiguities, abruptnesses, and dark transitions,\r\ncan be expected from the historian who is, at the same time, the\r\nsufferer of these disasters?\r\n\r\nI have said that I cast a look behind. Some object was expected to be\r\nseen, or why should I have gazed in that direction? Two senses were at\r\nonce assailed. The same piercing exclamation of HOLD! HOLD! was uttered\r\nwithin the same distance of my ear. This it was that I heard. The airy\r\nundulation, and the shock given to my nerves, were real. Whether the\r\nspectacle which I beheld existed in my fancy or without, might be\r\ndoubted. I had not closed the door of the apartment I had just left. The\r\nstair-case, at the foot of which I stood, was eight or ten feet from\r\nthe door, and attached to the wall through which the door led. My view,\r\ntherefore, was sidelong, and took in no part of the room.\r\n\r\nThrough this aperture was an head thrust and drawn back with so much\r\nswiftness, that the immediate conviction was, that thus much of a form,\r\nordinarily invisible, had been unshrowded. The face was turned towards\r\nme. Every muscle was tense; the forehead and brows were drawn into\r\nvehement expression; the lips were stretched as in the act of shrieking,\r\nand the eyes emitted sparks, which, no doubt, if I had been unattended\r\nby a light, would have illuminated like the coruscations of a meteor.\r\nThe sound and the vision were present, and departed together at the\r\nsame instant; but the cry was blown into my ear, while the face was many\r\npaces distant.\r\n\r\nThis face was well suited to a being whose performances exceeded the\r\nstandard of humanity, and yet its features were akin to those I had\r\nbefore seen. The image of Carwin was blended in a thousand ways with the\r\nstream of my thoughts. This visage was, perhaps, pourtrayed by my fancy.\r\nIf so, it will excite no surprize that some of his lineaments were now\r\ndiscovered. Yet affinities were few and unconspicuous, and were lost\r\namidst the blaze of opposite qualities.\r\n\r\nWhat conclusion could I form? Be the face human or not, the intimation\r\nwas imparted from above. Experience had evinced the benignity of that\r\nbeing who gave it. Once he had interposed to shield me from harm, and\r\nsubsequent events demonstrated the usefulness of that interposition. Now\r\nwas I again warned to forbear. I was hurrying to the verge of the same\r\ngulf, and the same power was exerted to recall my steps. Was it possible\r\nfor me not to obey? Was I capable of holding on in the same perilous\r\ncareer? Yes. Even of this I was capable!\r\n\r\nThe intimation was imperfect: it gave no form to my danger, and\r\nprescribed no limits to my caution. I had formerly neglected it, and yet\r\nescaped. Might I not trust to the same issue? This idea might possess,\r\nthough imperceptibly, some influence. I persisted; but it was not merely\r\non this account. I cannot delineate the motives that led me on. I now\r\nspeak as if no remnant of doubt existed in my mind as to the supernal\r\norigin of these sounds; but this is owing to the imperfection of my\r\nlanguage, for I only mean that the belief was more permanent, and\r\nvisited more frequently my sober meditations than its opposite. The\r\nimmediate effects served only to undermine the foundations of my\r\njudgment and precipitate my resolutions.\r\n\r\nI must either advance or return. I chose the former, and began to ascend\r\nthe stairs. The silence underwent no second interruption. My chamber\r\ndoor was closed, but unlocked, and, aided by vehement efforts of my\r\ncourage, I opened and looked in.\r\n\r\nNo hideous or uncommon object was discernible. The danger, indeed, might\r\neasily have lurked out of sight, have sprung upon me as I entered, and\r\nhave rent me with his iron talons; but I was blind to this fate, and\r\nadvanced, though cautiously, into the room.\r\n\r\nStill every thing wore its accustomed aspect. Neither lamp nor candle\r\nwas to be found. Now, for the first time, suspicions were suggested as\r\nto the nature of the light which I had seen. Was it possible to have\r\nbeen the companion of that supernatural visage; a meteorous refulgence\r\nproducible at the will of him to whom that visage belonged, and\r\npartaking of the nature of that which accompanied my father's death?\r\n\r\nThe closet was near, and I remembered the complicated horrors of which\r\nit had been productive. Here, perhaps, was inclosed the source of my\r\nperil, and the gratification of my curiosity. Should I adventure once\r\nmore to explore its recesses? This was a resolution not easily formed. I\r\nwas suspended in thought: when glancing my eye on a table, I perceived a\r\nwritten paper. Carwin's hand was instantly recognized, and snatching up\r\nthe paper, I read as follows:--\r\n\r\n\"There was folly in expecting your compliance with my invitation. Judge\r\nhow I was disappointed in finding another in your place. I have\r\nwaited, but to wait any longer would be perilous. I shall still seek an\r\ninterview, but it must be at a different time and place: meanwhile,\r\nI will write this--How will you bear--How inexplicable will be this\r\ntransaction!--An event so unexpected--a sight so horrible!\"\r\n\r\nSuch was this abrupt and unsatisfactory script. The ink was yet moist,\r\nthe hand was that of Carwin. Hence it was to be inferred that he had\r\nthis moment left the apartment, or was still in it. I looked back, on\r\nthe sudden expectation of seeing him behind me.\r\n\r\nWhat other did he mean? What transaction had taken place adverse to my\r\nexpectations? What sight was about to be exhibited? I looked around\r\nme once more, but saw nothing which indicated strangeness. Again I\r\nremembered the closet, and was resolved to seek in that the solution\r\nof these mysteries. Here, perhaps, was inclosed the scene destined to\r\nawaken my horrors and baffle my foresight.\r\n\r\nI have already said, that the entrance into this closet was beside my\r\nbed, which, on two sides, was closely shrowded by curtains. On that side\r\nnearest the closet, the curtain was raised. As I passed along I cast my\r\neye thither. I started, and looked again. I bore a light in my hand, and\r\nbrought it nearer my eyes, in order to dispel any illusive mists that\r\nmight have hovered before them. Once more I fixed my eyes upon the bed,\r\nin hope that this more stedfast scrutiny would annihilate the object\r\nwhich before seemed to be there.\r\n\r\nThis then was the sight which Carwin had predicted! This was the event\r\nwhich my understanding was to find inexplicable! This was the fate\r\nwhich had been reserved for me, but which, by some untoward chance, had\r\nbefallen on another!\r\n\r\nI had not been terrified by empty menaces. Violation and death awaited\r\nmy entrance into this chamber. Some inscrutable chance had led HER\r\nhither before me, and the merciless fangs of which I was designed to\r\nbe the prey, had mistaken their victim, and had fixed themselves in HER\r\nheart. But where was my safety? Was the mischief exhausted or flown? The\r\nsteps of the assassin had just been here; they could not be far off; in\r\na moment he would rush into my presence, and I should perish under the\r\nsame polluting and suffocating grasp!\r\n\r\nMy frame shook, and my knees were unable to support me. I gazed\r\nalternately at the closet door and at the door of my room. At one of\r\nthese avenues would enter the exterminator of my honor and my life. I\r\nwas prepared for defence; but now that danger was imminent, my means\r\nof defence, and my power to use them were gone. I was not qualified, by\r\neducation and experience, to encounter perils like these: or, perhaps,\r\nI was powerless because I was again assaulted by surprize, and had not\r\nfortified my mind by foresight and previous reflection against a scene\r\nlike this.\r\n\r\nFears for my own safety again yielded place to reflections on the scene\r\nbefore me. I fixed my eyes upon her countenance. My sister's well-known\r\nand beloved features could not be concealed by convulsion or lividness.\r\nWhat direful illusion led thee hither? Bereft of thee, what hold on\r\nhappiness remains to thy offspring and thy spouse? To lose thee by a\r\ncommon fate would have been sufficiently hard; but thus suddenly to\r\nperish--to become the prey of this ghastly death! How will a spectacle\r\nlike this be endured by Wieland? To die beneath his grasp would not\r\nsatisfy thy enemy. This was mercy to the evils which he previously made\r\nthee suffer! After these evils death was a boon which thou besoughtest\r\nhim to grant. He entertained no enmity against thee: I was the object of\r\nhis treason; but by some tremendous mistake his fury was misplaced. But\r\nhow comest thou hither? and where was Wieland in thy hour of distress?\r\n\r\nI approached the corpse: I lifted the still flexible hand, and kissed\r\nthe lips which were breathless. Her flowing drapery was discomposed.\r\nI restored it to order, and seating myself on the bed, again fixed\r\nstedfast eyes upon her countenance. I cannot distinctly recollect the\r\nruminations of that moment. I saw confusedly, but forcibly, that every\r\nhope was extinguished with the life of CATHARINE. All happiness and\r\ndignity must henceforth be banished from the house and name of Wieland:\r\nall that remained was to linger out in agonies a short existence; and\r\nleave to the world a monument of blasted hopes and changeable fortune.\r\nPleyel was already lost to me; yet, while Catharine lived life was not\r\na detestable possession: but now, severed from the companion of my\r\ninfancy, the partaker of all my thoughts, my cares, and my wishes, I\r\nwas like one set afloat upon a stormy sea, and hanging his safety upon a\r\nplank; night was closing upon him, and an unexpected surge had torn him\r\nfrom his hold and overwhelmed him forever.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter XVII\r\n\r\n\r\nI had no inclination nor power to move from this spot. For more than an\r\nhour, my faculties and limbs seemed to be deprived of all activity.\r\nThe door below creaked on its hinges, and steps ascended the stairs. My\r\nwandering and confused thoughts were instantly recalled by these sounds,\r\nand dropping the curtain of the bed, I moved to a part of the room\r\nwhere any one who entered should be visible; such are the vibrations of\r\nsentiment, that notwithstanding the seeming fulfilment of my fears,\r\nand increase of my danger, I was conscious, on this occasion, to no\r\nturbulence but that of curiosity.\r\n\r\nAt length he entered the apartment, and I recognized my brother. It was\r\nthe same Wieland whom I had ever seen. Yet his features were pervaded by\r\na new expression. I supposed him unacquainted with the fate of his wife,\r\nand his appearance confirmed this persuasion. A brow expanding into\r\nexultation I had hitherto never seen in him, yet such a brow did he now\r\nwear. Not only was he unapprized of the disaster that had happened,\r\nbut some joyous occurrence had betided. What a reverse was preparing to\r\nannihilate his transitory bliss! No husband ever doated more fondly, for\r\nno wife ever claimed so boundless a devotion. I was not uncertain as to\r\nthe effects to flow from the discovery of her fate. I confided not at\r\nall in the efforts of his reason or his piety. There were few evils\r\nwhich his modes of thinking would not disarm of their sting; but here,\r\nall opiates to grief, and all compellers of patience were vain. This\r\nspectacle would be unavoidably followed by the outrages of desperation,\r\nand a rushing to death.\r\n\r\nFor the present, I neglected to ask myself what motive brought him\r\nhither. I was only fearful of the effects to flow from the sight of the\r\ndead. Yet could it be long concealed from him? Some time and speedily\r\nhe would obtain this knowledge. No stratagems could considerably or\r\nusefully prolong his ignorance. All that could be sought was to take\r\naway the abruptness of the change, and shut out the confusion of\r\ndespair, and the inroads of madness: but I knew my brother, and knew\r\nthat all exertions to console him would be fruitless.\r\n\r\nWhat could I say? I was mute, and poured forth those tears on his\r\naccount, which my own unhappiness had been unable to extort. In the\r\nmidst of my tears, I was not unobservant of his motions. These were of\r\na nature to rouse some other sentiment than grief or, at least, to mix\r\nwith it a portion of astonishment.\r\n\r\nHis countenance suddenly became troubled. His hands were clasped with a\r\nforce that left the print of his nails in his flesh. His eyes were fixed\r\non my feet. His brain seemed to swell beyond its continent. He did not\r\ncease to breathe, but his breath was stifled into groans. I had never\r\nwitnessed the hurricane of human passions. My element had, till lately,\r\nbeen all sunshine and calm. I was unconversant with the altitudes and\r\nenergies of sentiment, and was transfixed with inexplicable horror by\r\nthe symptoms which I now beheld.\r\n\r\nAfter a silence and a conflict which I could not interpret, he lifted\r\nhis eyes to heaven, and in broken accents exclaimed, \"This is too much!\r\nAny victim but this, and thy will be done. Have I not sufficiently\r\nattested my faith and my obedience? She that is gone, they that have\r\nperished, were linked with my soul by ties which only thy command would\r\nhave broken; but here is sanctity and excellence surpassing human. This\r\nworkmanship is thine, and it cannot be thy will to heap it into ruins.\"\r\n\r\nHere suddenly unclasping his hands, he struck one of them against his\r\nforehead, and continued--\"Wretch! who made thee quicksighted in the\r\ncouncils of thy Maker? Deliverance from mortal fetters is awarded to\r\nthis being, and thou art the minister of this decree.\"\r\n\r\nSo saying, Wieland advanced towards me. His words and his motions were\r\nwithout meaning, except on one supposition. The death of Catharine was\r\nalready known to him, and that knowledge, as might have been suspected,\r\nhad destroyed his reason. I had feared nothing less; but now that I\r\nbeheld the extinction of a mind the most luminous and penetrating that\r\never dignified the human form, my sensations were fraught with new and\r\ninsupportable anguish.\r\n\r\nI had not time to reflect in what way my own safety would be effected by\r\nthis revolution, or what I had to dread from the wild conceptions of a\r\nmadman. He advanced towards me. Some hollow noises were wafted by the\r\nbreeze. Confused clamours were succeeded by many feet traversing the\r\ngrass, and then crowding intO the piazza.\r\n\r\nThese sounds suspended my brother's purpose, and he stood to listen. The\r\nsignals multiplied and grew louder; perceiving this, he turned from me,\r\nand hurried out of my sight. All about me was pregnant with motives to\r\nastonishment. My sister's corpse, Wieland's frantic demeanour, and, at\r\nlength, this crowd of visitants so little accorded with my foresight,\r\nthat my mental progress was stopped. The impulse had ceased which was\r\naccustomed to give motion and order to my thoughts.\r\n\r\nFootsteps thronged upon the stairs, and presently many faces shewed\r\nthemselves within the door of my apartment. These looks were full of\r\nalarm and watchfulness. They pryed into corners as if in search of\r\nsome fugitive; next their gaze was fixed upon me, and betokened all the\r\nvehemence of terror and pity. For a time I questioned whether these were\r\nnot shapes and faces like that which I had seen at the bottom of the\r\nstairs, creatures of my fancy or airy existences. My eye wandered from\r\none to another, till at length it fell on a countenance which I well\r\nknew. It was that of Mr. Hallet. This man was a distant kinsman of my\r\nmother, venerable for his age, his uprightness, and sagacity. He had\r\nlong discharged the functions of a magistrate and good citizen. If any\r\nterrors remained, his presence was sufficient to dispel them.\r\n\r\nHe approached, took my hand with a compassionate air, and said in a low\r\nvoice, \"Where, my dear Clara, are your brother and sister?\" I made no\r\nanswer, but pointed to the bed. His attendants drew aside the curtain,\r\nand while their eyes glared with horror at the spectacle which they\r\nbeheld, those of Mr. Hallet overflowed with tears.\r\n\r\nAfter considerable pause, he once more turned to me. \"My dear girl,\r\nthis sight is not for you. Can you confide in my care, and that of Mrs.\r\nBaynton's? We will see performed all that circumstances require.\"\r\n\r\nI made strenuous opposition to this request. I insisted on remaining\r\nnear her till she were interred. His remonstrances, however, and my own\r\nfeelings, shewed me the propriety of a temporary dereliction. Louisa\r\nstood in need of a comforter, and my brother's children of a nurse. My\r\nunhappy brother was himself an object of solicitude and care. At length,\r\nI consented to relinquish the corpse, and go to my brother's, whose\r\nhouse, I said, would need mistress, and his children a parent.\r\n\r\nDuring this discourse, my venerable friend struggled with his tears, but\r\nmy last intimation called them forth with fresh violence. Meanwhile,\r\nhis attendants stood round in mournful silence, gazing on me and at each\r\nother. I repeated my resolution, and rose to execute it; but he took my\r\nhand to detain me. His countenance betrayed irresolution and reluctance.\r\nI requested him to state the reason of his opposition to this measure.\r\nI entreated him to be explicit. I told him that my brother had just been\r\nthere, and that I knew his condition. This misfortune had driven him\r\nto madness, and his offspring must not want a protector. If he chose,\r\nI would resign Wieland to his care; but his innocent and helpless babes\r\nstood in instant need of nurse and mother, and these offices I would by\r\nno means allow another to perform while I had life.\r\n\r\nEvery word that I uttered seemed to augment his perplexity and distress.\r\nAt last he said, \"I think, Clara, I have entitled myself to some regard\r\nfrom you. You have professed your willingness to oblige me. Now I call\r\nupon you to confer upon me the highest obligation in your power. Permit\r\nMrs. Baynton to have the management of your brother's house for two or\r\nthree days; then it shall be yours to act in it as you please. No matter\r\nwhat are my motives in making this request: perhaps I think your\r\nage, your sex, or the distress which this disaster must occasion,\r\nincapacitates you for the office. Surely you have no doubt of Mrs.\r\nBaynton's tenderness or discretion.\" New ideas now rushed into my mind.\r\nI fixed my eyes stedfastly on Mr. Hallet. \"Are they well?\" said I. \"Is\r\nLouisa well? Are Benjamin, and William, and Constantine, and Little\r\nClara, are they safe? Tell me truly, I beseech you!\"\r\n\r\n\"They are well,\" he replied; \"they are perfectly safe.\"\r\n\r\n\"Fear no effeminate weakness in me: I can bear to hear the truth. Tell\r\nme truly, are they well?\"\r\n\r\nHe again assured me that they were well.\r\n\r\n\"What then,\" resumed I, \"do you fear? Is it possible for any calamity to\r\ndisqualify me for performing my duty to these helpless innocents? I\r\nam willing to divide the care of them with Mrs. Baynton; I shall be\r\ngrateful for her sympathy and aid; but what should I be to desert them\r\nat an hour like this!\"\r\n\r\nI will cut short this distressful dialogue. I still persisted in my\r\npurpose, and he still persisted in his opposition. This excited my\r\nsuspicions anew; but these were removed by solemn declarations of their\r\nsafety. I could not explain this conduct in my friend; but at length\r\nconsented to go to the city, provided I should see them for a few\r\nminutes at present, and should return on the morrow.\r\n\r\nEven this arrangement was objected to. At length he told me they were\r\nremoved to the city. Why were they removed, I asked, and whither? My\r\nimportunities would not now be eluded. My suspicions were roused, and no\r\nevasion or artifice was sufficient to allay them. Many of the audience\r\nbegan to give vent to their emotions in tears. Mr. Hallet himself seemed\r\nas if the conflict were too hard to be longer sustained. Something\r\nwhispered to my heart that havoc had been wider than I now witnessed.\r\nI suspected this concealment to arise from apprehensions of the\r\neffects which a knowledge of the truth would produce in me. I once\r\nmore entreated him to inform me truly of their state. To enforce my\r\nentreaties, I put on an air of insensibility. \"I can guess,\" said I,\r\n\"what has happened--They are indeed beyond the reach of injury, for they\r\nare dead! Is it not so?\" My voice faltered in spite of my courageous\r\nefforts.\r\n\r\n\"Yes,\" said he, \"they are dead! Dead by the same fate, and by the same\r\nhand, with their mother!\"\r\n\r\n\"Dead!\" replied I; \"what, all?\"\r\n\r\n\"All!\" replied he: \"he spared NOT ONE!\"\r\n\r\nAllow me, my friends, to close my eyes upon the after-scene. Why should\r\nI protract a tale which I already begin to feel is too long? Over this\r\nscene at least let me pass lightly. Here, indeed, my narrative would be\r\nimperfect. All was tempestuous commotion in my heart and in my brain. I\r\nhave no memory for ought but unconscious transitions and rueful sights.\r\nI was ingenious and indefatigable in the invention of torments. I would\r\nnot dispense with any spectacle adapted to exasperate my grief. Each\r\npale and mangled form I crushed to my bosom. Louisa, whom I loved with\r\nso ineffable a passion, was denied to me at first, but my obstinacy\r\nconquered their reluctance.\r\n\r\nThey led the way into a darkened hall. A lamp pendant from the ceiling\r\nwas uncovered, and they pointed to a table. The assassin had defrauded\r\nme of my last and miserable consolation. I sought not in her visage, for\r\nthe tinge of the morning, and the lustre of heaven. These had vanished\r\nwith life; but I hoped for liberty to print a last kiss upon her lips.\r\nThis was denied me; for such had been the merciless blow that destroyed\r\nher, that not a LINEAMENT REMAINED!\r\n\r\nI was carried hence to the city. Mrs. Hallet was my companion and my\r\nnurse. Why should I dwell upon the rage of fever, and the effusions\r\nof delirium? Carwin was the phantom that pursued my dreams, the giant\r\noppressor under whose arm I was for ever on the point of being crushed.\r\nStrenuous muscles were required to hinder my flight, and hearts of steel\r\nto withstand the eloquence of my fears. In vain I called upon them to\r\nlook upward, to mark his sparkling rage and scowling contempt. All I\r\nsought was to fly from the stroke that was lifted. Then I heaped upon my\r\nguards the most vehement reproaches, or betook myself to wailings on the\r\nhaplessness of my condition.\r\n\r\nThis malady, at length, declined, and my weeping friends began to look\r\nfor my restoration. Slowly, and with intermitted beams, memory revisited\r\nme. The scenes that I had witnessed were revived, became the theme\r\nof deliberation and deduction, and called forth the effusions of more\r\nrational sorrow.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter XVIII\r\n\r\n\r\nI had imperfectly recovered my strength, when I was informed of the\r\narrival of my mother's brother, Thomas Cambridge. Ten years since, he\r\nwent to Europe, and was a surgeon in the British forces in Germany,\r\nduring the whole of the late war. After its conclusion, some connection\r\nthat he had formed with an Irish officer, made him retire into Ireland.\r\nIntercourse had been punctually maintained by letters with his sister's\r\nchildren, and hopes were given that he would shortly return to his\r\nnative country, and pass his old age in our society. He was now in an\r\nevil hour arrived.\r\n\r\nI desired an interview with him for numerous and urgent reasons. With\r\nthe first returns of my understanding I had anxiously sought information\r\nof the fate of my brother. During the course of my disease I had never\r\nseen him; and vague and unsatisfactory answers were returned to all my\r\ninquires. I had vehemently interrogated Mrs. Hallet and her husband, and\r\nsolicited an interview with this unfortunate man; but they mysteriously\r\ninsinuated that his reason was still unsettled, and that his\r\ncircumstances rendered an interview impossible. Their reserve on the\r\nparticulars of this destruction, and the author of it, was equally\r\ninvincible.\r\n\r\nFor some time, finding all my efforts fruitless, I had desisted from\r\ndirect inquiries and solicitations, determined, as soon as my strength\r\nwas sufficiently renewed, to pursue other means of dispelling my\r\nuncertainty. In this state of things my uncle's arrival and intention to\r\nvisit me were announced. I almost shuddered to behold the face of this\r\nman. When I reflected on the disasters that had befallen us, I was half\r\nunwilling to witness that dejection and grief which would be disclosed\r\nin his countenance. But I believed that all transactions had been\r\nthoroughly disclosed to him, and confided in my importunity to extort\r\nfrom him the knowledge that I sought.\r\n\r\nI had no doubt as to the person of our enemy; but the motives that urged\r\nhim to perpetrate these horrors, the means that he used, and his present\r\ncondition, were totally unknown. It was reasonable to expect some\r\ninformation on this head, from my uncle. I therefore waited his coming\r\nwith impatience. At length, in the dusk of the evening, and in my\r\nsolitary chamber, this meeting took place.\r\n\r\nThis man was our nearest relation, and had ever treated us with the\r\naffection of a parent. Our meeting, therefore, could not be without\r\noverflowing tenderness and gloomy joy. He rather encouraged than\r\nrestrained the tears that I poured out in his arms, and took upon\r\nhimself the task of comforter. Allusions to recent disasters could not\r\nbe long omitted. One topic facilitated the admission of another. At\r\nlength, I mentioned and deplored the ignorance in which I had been\r\nkept respecting my brother's destiny, and the circumstances of our\r\nmisfortunes. I entreated him to tell me what was Wieland's condition,\r\nand what progress had been made in detecting or punishing the author of\r\nthis unheard-of devastation.\r\n\r\n\"The author!\" said he; \"Do you know the author?\"\r\n\r\n\"Alas!\" I answered, \"I am too well acquainted with him. The story of\r\nthe grounds of my suspicions would be painful and too long. I am not\r\napprized of the extent of your present knowledge. There are none but\r\nWieland, Pleyel, and myself, who are able to relate certain facts.\"\r\n\r\n\"Spare yourself the pain,\" said he. \"All that Wieland and Pleyel can\r\ncommunicate, I know already. If any thing of moment has fallen within\r\nyour own exclusive knowledge, and the relation be not too arduous for\r\nyour present strength, I confess I am desirous of hearing it. Perhaps\r\nyou allude to one by the name of Carwin. I will anticipate your\r\ncuriosity by saying, that since these disasters, no one has seen or\r\nheard of him. His agency is, therefore, a mystery still unsolved.\"\r\n\r\nI readily complied with his request, and related as distinctly as\r\nI could, though in general terms, the events transacted in the\r\nsummer-house and my chamber. He listened without apparent surprize\r\nto the tale of Pleyel's errors and suspicions, and with augmented\r\nseriousness, to my narrative of the warnings and inexplicable vision,\r\nand the letter found upon the table. I waited for his comments.\r\n\r\n\"You gather from this,\" said he, \"that Carwin is the author of all this\r\nmisery.\"\r\n\r\n\"Is it not,\" answered I, \"an unavoidable inference? But what know you\r\nrespecting it? Was it possible to execute this mischief without witness\r\nor coadjutor? I beseech you to relate to me, when and why Mr. Hallet was\r\nsummoned to the scene, and by whom this disaster was first suspected\r\nor discovered. Surely, suspicion must have fallen upon some one, and\r\npursuit was made.\"\r\n\r\nMy uncle rose from his seat, and traversed the floor with hasty steps.\r\nHis eyes were fixed upon the ground, and he seemed buried in perplexity.\r\nAt length he paused, and said with an emphatic tone, \"It is true; the\r\ninstrument is known. Carwin may have plotted, but the execution was\r\nanother's. That other is found, and his deed is ascertained.\"\r\n\r\n\"Good heaven!\" I exclaimed, \"what say you? Was not Carwin the assassin?\r\nCould any hand but his have carried into act this dreadful purpose?\"\r\n\r\n\"Have I not said,\" returned he, \"that the performance was another's?\r\nCarwin, perhaps, or heaven, or insanity, prompted the murderer; but\r\nCarwin is unknown. The actual performer has, long since, been called\r\nto judgment and convicted, and is, at this moment, at the bottom of a\r\ndungeon loaded with chains.\"\r\n\r\nI lifted my hands and eyes. \"Who then is this assassin? By what means,\r\nand whither was he traced? What is the testimony of his guilt?\"\r\n\r\n\"His own, corroborated with that of a servant-maid who spied the murder\r\nof the children from a closet where she was concealed. The magistrate\r\nreturned from your dwelling to your brother's. He was employed in\r\nhearing and recording the testimony of the only witness, when the\r\ncriminal himself, unexpected, unsolicited, unsought, entered the hall,\r\nacknowledged his guilt, and rendered himself up to justice.\r\n\r\n\"He has since been summoned to the bar. The audience was composed of\r\nthousands whom rumours of this wonderful event had attracted from the\r\ngreatest distance. A long and impartial examination was made, and the\r\nprisoner was called upon for his defence. In compliance with this call\r\nhe delivered an ample relation of his motives and actions.\" There he\r\nstopped.\r\n\r\nI besought him to say who this criminal was, and what the instigations\r\nthat compelled him. My uncle was silent. I urged this inquiry with new\r\nforce. I reverted to my own knowledge, and sought in this some basis to\r\nconjecture. I ran over the scanty catalogue of the men whom I knew; I\r\nlighted on no one who was qualified for ministering to malice like this.\r\nAgain I resorted to importunity. Had I ever seen the criminal? Was it\r\nsheer cruelty, or diabolical revenge that produced this overthrow?\r\n\r\nHe surveyed me, for a considerable time, and listened to my\r\ninterrogations in silence. At length he spoke: \"Clara, I have known thee\r\nby report, and in some degree by observation. Thou art a being of no\r\nvulgar sort. Thy friends have hitherto treated thee as a child. They\r\nmeant well, but, perhaps, they were unacquainted with thy strength. I\r\nassure myself that nothing will surpass thy fortitude.\r\n\r\n\"Thou art anxious to know the destroyer of thy family, his actions, and\r\nhis motives. Shall I call him to thy presence, and permit him to confess\r\nbefore thee? Shall I make him the narrator of his own tale?\"\r\n\r\nI started on my feet, and looked round me with fearful glances, as if\r\nthe murderer was close at hand. \"What do you mean?\" said I; \"put an end,\r\nI beseech you, to this suspence.\"\r\n\r\n\"Be not alarmed; you will never more behold the face of this criminal,\r\nunless he be gifted with supernatural strength, and sever like threads\r\nthe constraint of links and bolts. I have said that the assassin was\r\narraigned at the bar, and that the trial ended with a summons from the\r\njudge to confess or to vindicate his actions. A reply was immediately\r\nmade with significance of gesture, and a tranquil majesty, which denoted\r\nless of humanity than godhead. Judges, advocates and auditors were\r\npanic-struck and breathless with attention. One of the hearers\r\nfaithfully recorded the speech. There it is,\" continued he, putting a\r\nroll of papers in my hand, \"you may read it at your leisure.\"\r\n\r\nWith these words my uncle left me alone. My curiosity refused me a\r\nmoment's delay. I opened the papers, and read as follows.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter XIX\r\n\r\n\r\n\"Theodore Wieland, the prisoner at the bar, was now called upon for his\r\ndefence. He looked around him for some time in silence, and with a mild\r\ncountenance. At length he spoke:\r\n\r\n\"It is strange; I am known to my judges and my auditors. Who is there\r\npresent a stranger to the character of Wieland? who knows him not as an\r\nhusband--as a father--as a friend? yet here am I arraigned as criminal.\r\nI am charged with diabolical malice; I am accused of the murder of my\r\nwife and my children!\r\n\r\n\"It is true, they were slain by me; they all perished by my hand.\r\nThe task of vindication is ignoble. What is it that I am called to\r\nvindicate? and before whom?\r\n\r\n\"You know that they are dead, and that they were killed by me. What more\r\nwould you have? Would you extort from me a statement of my motives? Have\r\nyou failed to discover them already? You charge me with malice; but your\r\neyes are not shut; your reason is still vigorous; your memory has not\r\nforsaken you. You know whom it is that you thus charge. The habits of\r\nhis life are known to you; his treatment of his wife and his\r\noffspring is known to you; the soundness of his integrity, and the\r\nunchangeableness of his principles, are familiar to your apprehension;\r\nyet you persist in this charge! You lead me hither manacled as a felon;\r\nyou deem me worthy of a vile and tormenting death!\r\n\r\n\"Who are they whom I have devoted to death? My wife--the little ones,\r\nthat drew their being from me--that creature who, as she surpassed\r\nthem in excellence, claimed a larger affection than those whom natural\r\naffinities bound to my heart. Think ye that malice could have urged me\r\nto this deed? Hide your audacious fronts from the scrutiny of heaven.\r\nTake refuge in some cavern unvisited by human eyes. Ye may deplore your\r\nwickedness or folly, but ye cannot expiate it.\r\n\r\n\"Think not that I speak for your sakes. Hug to your hearts this\r\ndetestable infatuation. Deem me still a murderer, and drag me to\r\nuntimely death. I make not an effort to dispel your illusion: I utter\r\nnot a word to cure you of your sanguinary folly: but there are probably\r\nsome in this assembly who have come from far: for their sakes, whose\r\ndistance has disabled them from knowing me, I will tell what I have\r\ndone, and why.\r\n\r\n\"It is needless to say that God is the object of my supreme passion.\r\nI have cherished, in his presence, a single and upright heart. I have\r\nthirsted for the knowledge of his will. I have burnt with ardour to\r\napprove my faith and my obedience.\r\n\r\n\"My days have been spent in searching for the revelation of that will;\r\nbut my days have been mournful, because my search failed. I solicited\r\ndirection: I turned on every side where glimmerings of light could be\r\ndiscovered. I have not been wholly uninformed; but my knowledge has\r\nalways stopped short of certainty. Dissatisfaction has insinuated\r\nitself into all my thoughts. My purposes have been pure; my wishes\r\nindefatigable; but not till lately were these purposes thoroughly\r\naccomplished, and these wishes fully gratified.\r\n\r\n\"I thank thee, my father, for thy bounty; that thou didst not ask a less\r\nsacrifice than this; that thou placedst me in a condition to testify my\r\nsubmission to thy will! What have I withheld which it was thy pleasure\r\nto exact? Now may I, with dauntless and erect eye, claim my reward,\r\nsince I have given thee the treasure of my soul.\r\n\r\n\"I was at my own house: it was late in the evening: my sister had gone\r\nto the city, but proposed to return. It was in expectation of her return\r\nthat my wife and I delayed going to bed beyond the usual hour; the rest\r\nof the family, however, were retired.\r\n\r\n\"My mind was contemplative and calm; not wholly devoid of apprehension\r\non account of my sister's safety. Recent events, not easily explained,\r\nhad suggested the existence of some danger; but this danger was\r\nwithout a distinct form in our imagination, and scarcely ruffled our\r\ntranquillity.\r\n\r\n\"Time passed, and my sister did not arrive; her house is at some\r\ndistance from mine, and though her arrangements had been made with a\r\nview to residing with us, it was possible that, through forgetfulness,\r\nor the occurrence of unforeseen emergencies, she had returned to her own\r\ndwelling.\r\n\r\n\"Hence it was conceived proper that I should ascertain the truth by\r\ngoing thither. I went. On my way my mind was full of these ideas\r\nwhich related to my intellectual condition. In the torrent of fervid\r\nconceptions, I lost sight of my purpose. Some times I stood still;\r\nsome times I wandered from my path, and experienced some difficulty, on\r\nrecovering from my fit of musing, to regain it.\r\n\r\n\"The series of my thoughts is easily traced. At first every vein beat\r\nwith raptures known only to the man whose parental and conjugal love\r\nis without limits, and the cup of whose desires, immense as it is,\r\noverflows with gratification. I know not why emotions that were\r\nperpetual visitants should now have recurred with unusual energy. The\r\ntransition was not new from sensations of joy to a consciousness of\r\ngratitude. The author of my being was likewise the dispenser of every\r\ngift with which that being was embellished. The service to which a\r\nbenefactor like this was entitled, could not be circumscribed. My social\r\nsentiments were indebted to their alliance with devotion for all their\r\nvalue. All passions are base, all joys feeble, all energies malignant,\r\nwhich are not drawn from this source.\r\n\r\n\"For a time, my contemplations soared above earth and its inhabitants.\r\nI stretched forth my hands; I lifted my eyes, and exclaimed, O! that I\r\nmight be admitted to thy presence; that mine were the supreme delight of\r\nknowing thy will, and of performing it! The blissful privilege of direct\r\ncommunication with thee, and of listening to the audible enunciation of\r\nthy pleasure!\r\n\r\n\"What task would I not undertake, what privation would I not cheerfully\r\nendure, to testify my love of thee? Alas! thou hidest thyself from my\r\nview: glimpses only of thy excellence and beauty are afforded me. Would\r\nthat a momentary emanation from thy glory would visit me! that some\r\nunambiguous token of thy presence would salute my senses!\r\n\r\n\"In this mood, I entered the house of my sister. It was vacant. Scarcely\r\nhad I regained recollection of the purpose that brought me hither.\r\nThoughts of a different tendency had such absolute possession of my\r\nmind, that the relations of time and space were almost obliterated from\r\nmy understanding. These wanderings, however, were restrained, and I\r\nascended to her chamber.\r\n\r\n\"I had no light, and might have known by external observation, that\r\nthe house was without any inhabitant. With this, however, I was\r\nnot satisfied. I entered the room, and the object of my search not\r\nappearing, I prepared to return.\r\n\r\n\"The darkness required some caution in descending the stair. I stretched\r\nmy hand to seize the balustrade by which I might regulate my steps.\r\nHow shall I describe the lustre, which, at that moment, burst upon my\r\nvision!\r\n\r\n\"I was dazzled. My organs were bereaved of their activity. My eye-lids\r\nwere half-closed, and my hands withdrawn from the balustrade. A nameless\r\nfear chilled my veins, and I stood motionless. This irradiation did not\r\nretire or lessen. It seemed as if some powerful effulgence covered me\r\nlike a mantle.\r\n\r\n\"I opened my eyes and found all about me luminous and glowing. It was\r\nthe element of heaven that flowed around. Nothing but a fiery stream was\r\nat first visible; but, anon, a shrill voice from behind called upon me\r\nto attend.\r\n\r\n\"I turned: It is forbidden to describe what I saw: Words, indeed, would\r\nbe wanting to the task. The lineaments of that being, whose veil was now\r\nlifted, and whose visage beamed upon my sight, no hues of pencil or of\r\nlanguage can pourtray.\r\n\r\n\"As it spoke, the accents thrilled to my heart. \"Thy prayers are heard.\r\nIn proof of thy faith, render me thy wife. This is the victim I chuse.\r\nCall her hither, and here let her fall.\"--The sound, and visage, and\r\nlight vanished at once.\r\n\r\n\"What demand was this? The blood of Catharine was to be shed! My wife\r\nwas to perish by my hand! I sought opportunity to attest my virtue.\r\nLittle did I expect that a proof like this would have been demanded.\r\n\r\n\"My wife! I exclaimed: O God! substitute some other victim. Make me\r\nnot the butcher of my wife. My own blood is cheap. This will I pour\r\nout before thee with a willing heart; but spare, I beseech thee, this\r\nprecious life, or commission some other than her husband to perform the\r\nbloody deed.\r\n\r\n\"In vain. The conditions were prescribed; the decree had gone forth, and\r\nnothing remained but to execute it. I rushed out of the house and across\r\nthe intermediate fields, and stopped not till I entered my own parlour.\r\n\"My wife had remained here during my absence, in anxious expectation of\r\nmy return with some tidings of her sister. I had none to communicate.\r\nFor a time, I was breathless with my speed: This, and the tremors\r\nthat shook my frame, and the wildness of my looks, alarmed her. She\r\nimmediately suspected some disaster to have happened to her friend, and\r\nher own speech was as much overpowered by emotion as mine.\r\n\r\n\"She was silent, but her looks manifested her impatience to hear what I\r\nhad to communicate. I spoke, but with so much precipitation as scarcely\r\nto be understood; catching her, at the same time, by the arm, and\r\nforcibly pulling her from her seat.\r\n\r\n\"Come along with me: fly: waste not a moment: time will be lost, and the\r\ndeed will be omitted. Tarry not; question not; but fly with me!\r\n\r\n\"This deportment added afresh to her alarms. Her eyes pursued mine, and\r\nshe said, \"What is the matter? For God's sake what is the matter? Where\r\nwould you have me go?\"\r\n\r\n\"My eyes were fixed upon her countenance while she spoke. I thought\r\nupon her virtues; I viewed her as the mother of my babes: as my wife:\r\nI recalled the purpose for which I thus urged her attendance. My heart\r\nfaltered, and I saw that I must rouse to this work all my faculties. The\r\ndanger of the least delay was imminent.\r\n\r\n\"I looked away from her, and again exerting my force, drew her towards\r\nthe door--'You must go with me--indeed you must.'\r\n\r\n\"In her fright she half-resisted my efforts, and again exclaimed, 'Good\r\nheaven! what is it you mean? Where go? What has happened? Have you found\r\nClara?\"\r\n\r\n\"Follow me, and you will see,\" I answered, still urging her reluctant\r\nsteps forward.\r\n\r\n\"What phrenzy has seized you? Something must needs have happened. Is she\r\nsick? Have you found her?\"\r\n\r\n\"Come and see. Follow me, and know for yourself.\"\r\n\r\n\"Still she expostulated and besought me to explain this mysterious\r\nbehaviour. I could not trust myself to answer her; to look at her; but\r\ngrasping her arm, I drew her after me. She hesitated, rather through\r\nconfusion of mind than from unwillingness to accompany me. This\r\nconfusion gradually abated, and she moved forward, but with irresolute\r\nfootsteps, and continual exclamations of wonder and terror. Her\r\ninterrogations Of \"what was the matter?\" and \"whither was I going?\" were\r\nceaseless and vehement.\r\n\r\n\"It was the scope of my efforts not to think; to keep up a conflict and\r\nuproar in my mind in which all order and distinctness should be lost;\r\nto escape from the sensations produced by her voice. I was, therefore,\r\nsilent. I strove to abridge this interval by my haste, and to waste all\r\nmy attention in furious gesticulations.\r\n\r\n\"In this state of mind we reached my sister's door. She looked at the\r\nwindows and saw that all was desolate--\"Why come we here? There is no\r\nbody here. I will not go in.\"\r\n\r\n\"Still I was dumb; but opening the door, I drew her into the entry. This\r\nwas the allotted scene: here she was to fall. I let go her hand, and\r\npressing my palms against my forehead, made one mighty effort to work up\r\nmy soul to the deed.\r\n\r\n\"In vain; it would not be; my courage was appalled; my arms nerveless:\r\nI muttered prayers that my strength might be aided from above. They\r\navailed nothing.\r\n\r\n\"Horror diffused itself over me. This conviction of my cowardice, my\r\nrebellion, fastened upon me, and I stood rigid and cold as marble. From\r\nthis state I was somewhat relieved by my wife's voice, who renewed her\r\nsupplications to be told why we came hither, and what was the fate of my\r\nsister.\r\n\r\n\"What could I answer? My words were broken and inarticulate. Her fears\r\nnaturally acquired force from the observation of these symptoms; but\r\nthese fears were misplaced. The only inference she deduced from my\r\nconduct was, that some terrible mishap had befallen Clara.\r\n\r\n\"She wrung her hands, and exclaimed in an agony, \"O tell me, where is\r\nshe? What has become of her? Is she sick? Dead? Is she in her chamber? O\r\nlet me go thither and know the worst!\"\r\n\r\n\"This proposal set my thoughts once more in motion. Perhaps what my\r\nrebellious heart refused to perform here, I might obtain strength enough\r\nto execute elsewhere.\r\n\r\n\"Come then,\" said I, \"let us go.\"\r\n\r\n\"I will, but not in the dark. We must first procure a light.\"\r\n\r\n\"Fly then and procure it; but I charge you, linger not. I will await for\r\nyour return.\r\n\r\n\"While she was gone, I strode along the entry. The fellness of a gloomy\r\nhurricane but faintly resembled the discord that reigned in my mind. To\r\nomit this sacrifice must not be; yet my sinews had refused to perform\r\nit. No alternative was offered. To rebel against the mandate was\r\nimpossible; but obedience would render me the executioner of my wife. My\r\nwill was strong, but my limbs refused their office.\r\n\r\n\"She returned with a light; I led the way to the chamber; she looked\r\nround her; she lifted the curtain of the bed; she saw nothing.\r\n\r\n\"At length, she fixed inquiring eyes upon me. The light now enabled her\r\nto discover in my visage what darkness had hitherto concealed. Her\r\ncares were now transferred from my sister to myself, and she said in\r\na tremulous voice, \"Wieland! you are not well: What ails you? Can I do\r\nnothing for you?\"\r\n\r\n\"That accents and looks so winning should disarm me of my resolution,\r\nwas to be expected. My thoughts were thrown anew into anarchy. I spread\r\nmy hand before my eyes that I might not see her, and answered only by\r\ngroans. She took my other hand between her's, and pressing it to her\r\nheart, spoke with that voice which had ever swayed my will, and wafted\r\naway sorrow.\r\n\r\n\"My friend! my soul's friend! tell me thy cause of grief. Do I not merit\r\nto partake with thee in thy cares? Am I not thy wife?\"\r\n\r\n\"This was too much. I broke from her embrace, and retired to a corner\r\nof the room. In this pause, courage was once more infused into me. I\r\nresolved to execute my duty. She followed me, and renewed her passionate\r\nentreaties to know the cause of my distress.\r\n\r\n\"I raised my head and regarded her with stedfast looks. I muttered\r\nsomething about death, and the injunctions of my duty. At these words\r\nshe shrunk back, and looked at me with a new expression of anguish.\r\nAfter a pause, she clasped her hands, and exclaimed--\r\n\r\n\"O Wieland! Wieland! God grant that I am mistaken; but surely something\r\nis wrong. I see it: it is too plain: thou art undone--lost to me and\r\nto thyself.\" At the same time she gazed on my features with intensest\r\nanxiety, in hope that different symptoms would take place. I replied to\r\nher with vehemence--\r\n\r\n\"Undone! No; my duty is known, and I thank my God that my cowardice is\r\nnow vanquished, and I have power to fulfil it. Catharine! I pity the\r\nweakness of thy nature: I pity thee, but must not spare. Thy life is\r\nclaimed from my hands: thou must die!\"\r\n\r\n\"Fear was now added to her grief. 'What mean you? Why talk you of death?\r\nBethink yourself, Wieland: bethink yourself, and this fit will pass. O\r\nwhy came I hither! Why did you drag me hither?'\r\n\r\n\"I brought thee hither to fulfil a divine command. I am appointed thy\r\ndestroyer, and destroy thee I must.\" Saying this I seized her wrists.\r\nShe shrieked aloud, and endeavoured to free herself from my grasp; but\r\nher efforts were vain.\r\n\r\n\"Surely, surely Wieland, thou dost not mean it. Am I not thy wife? and\r\nwouldst thou kill me? Thou wilt not; and yet--I see--thou art Wieland\r\nno longer! A fury resistless and horrible possesses thee--Spare\r\nme--spare--help--help--\"\r\n\r\n\"Till her breath was stopped she shrieked for help--for mercy. When\r\nshe could speak no longer, her gestures, her looks appealed to my\r\ncompassion. My accursed hand was irresolute and tremulous. I meant\r\nthy death to be sudden, thy struggles to be brief. Alas! my heart was\r\ninfirm; my resolves mutable. Thrice I slackened my grasp, and life kept\r\nits hold, though in the midst of pangs. Her eye-balls started from their\r\nsockets. Grimness and distortion took place of all that used to bewitch\r\nme into transport, and subdue me into reverence.\r\n\r\n\"I was commissioned to kill thee, but not to torment thee with the\r\nforesight of thy death; not to multiply thy fears, and prolong thy\r\nagonies. Haggard, and pale, and lifeless, at length thou ceasedst to\r\ncontend with thy destiny.\r\n\r\n\"This was a moment of triumph. Thus had I successfully subdued the\r\nstubbornness of human passions: the victim which had been demanded was\r\ngiven: the deed was done past recal.\r\n\r\n\"I lifted the corpse in my arms and laid it on the bed. I gazed upon\r\nit with delight. Such was the elation of my thoughts, that I even broke\r\ninto laughter. I clapped my hands and exclaimed, 'It is done! My sacred\r\nduty is fulfilled! To that I have sacrificed, O my God! thy last and\r\nbest gift, my wife!'\r\n\r\n\"For a while I thus soared above frailty. I imagined I had set myself\r\nforever beyond the reach of selfishness; but my imaginations were false.\r\nThis rapture quickly subsided. I looked again at my wife. My joyous\r\nebullitions vanished, and I asked myself who it was whom I saw?\r\nMethought it could not be Catharine. It could not be the woman who had\r\nlodged for years in my heart; who had slept, nightly, in my bosom; who\r\nhad borne in her womb, who had fostered at her breast, the beings who\r\ncalled me father; whom I had watched with delight, and cherished with a\r\nfondness ever new and perpetually growing: it could not be the same.\r\n\r\n\"Where was her bloom! These deadly and blood-suffused orbs but ill\r\nresemble the azure and exstatic tenderness of her eyes. The lucid stream\r\nthat meandered over that bosom, the glow of love that was wont to sit\r\nupon that cheek, are much unlike these livid stains and this hideous\r\ndeformity. Alas! these were the traces of agony; the gripe of the\r\nassassin had been here!\r\n\r\n\"I will not dwell upon my lapse into desperate and outrageous sorrow.\r\nThe breath of heaven that sustained me was withdrawn and I sunk into\r\nMERE MAN. I leaped from the floor: I dashed my head against the wall:\r\nI uttered screams of horror: I panted after torment and pain. Eternal\r\nfire, and the bickerings of hell, compared with what I felt, were music\r\nand a bed of roses.\r\n\r\n\"I thank my God that this degeneracy was transient, that he deigned once\r\nmore to raise me aloft. I thought upon what I had done as a sacrifice to\r\nduty, and WAS CALM. My wife was dead; but I reflected, that though this\r\nsource of human consolation was closed, yet others were still open. If\r\nthe transports of an husband were no more, the feelings of a father had\r\nstill scope for exercise. When remembrance of their mother should excite\r\ntoo keen a pang, I would look upon them, and BE COMFORTED.\r\n\r\n\"While I revolved these ideas, new warmth flowed in upon my heart--I was\r\nwrong. These feelings were the growth of selfishness. Of this I was\r\nnot aware, and to dispel the mist that obscured my perceptions, a new\r\neffulgence and a new mandate were necessary.\r\n\r\n\"From these thoughts I was recalled by a ray that was shot into the\r\nroom. A voice spake like that which I had before heard--'Thou hast done\r\nwell; but all is not done--the sacrifice is incomplete--thy children\r\nmust be offered--they must perish with their mother!--'\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter XX\r\n\r\n\r\nWill you wonder that I read no farther? Will you not rather be\r\nastonished that I read thus far? What power supported me through such a\r\ntask I know not. Perhaps the doubt from which I could not disengage\r\nmy mind, that the scene here depicted was a dream, contributed to my\r\nperseverance. In vain the solemn introduction of my uncle, his appeals\r\nto my fortitude, and allusions to something monstrous in the events\r\nhe was about to disclose; in vain the distressful perplexity, the\r\nmysterious silence and ambiguous answers of my attendants, especially\r\nwhen the condition of my brother was the theme of my inquiries, were\r\nremembered. I recalled the interview with Wieland in my chamber, his\r\npreternatural tranquillity succeeded by bursts of passion and menacing\r\nactions. All these coincided with the tenor of this paper.\r\n\r\nCatharine and her children, and Louisa were dead. The act that destroyed\r\nthem was, in the highest degree, inhuman. It was worthy of savages\r\ntrained to murder, and exulting in agonies.\r\n\r\nWho was the performer of the deed? Wieland! My brother! The husband\r\nand the father! That man of gentle virtues and invincible benignity!\r\nplacable and mild--an idolator of peace! Surely, said I, it is a dream.\r\nFor many days have I been vexed with frenzy. Its dominion is still felt;\r\nbut new forms are called up to diversify and augment my torments.\r\n\r\nThe paper dropped from my hand, and my eyes followed it. I shrunk back,\r\nas if to avoid some petrifying influence that approached me. My tongue\r\nwas mute; all the functions of nature were at a stand, and I sunk upon\r\nthe floor lifeless. The noise of my fall, as I afterwards heard, alarmed\r\nmy uncle, who was in a lower apartment, and whose apprehensions had\r\ndetained him. He hastened to my chamber, and administered the assistance\r\nwhich my condition required. When I opened my eyes I beheld him before\r\nme. His skill as a reasoner as well as a physician, was exerted to\r\nobviate the injurious effects of this disclosure; but he had wrongly\r\nestimated the strength of my body or of my mind. This new shock brought\r\nme once more to the brink of the grave, and my malady was much more\r\ndifficult to subdue than at first.\r\n\r\nI will not dwell upon the long train of dreary sensations, and the\r\nhideous confusion of my understanding. Time slowly restored its\r\ncustomary firmness to my frame, and order to my thoughts. The images\r\nimpressed upon my mind by this fatal paper were somewhat effaced by my\r\nmalady. They were obscure and disjointed like the parts of a dream. I\r\nwas desirous of freeing my imagination from this chaos. For this end I\r\nquestioned my uncle, who was my constant companion. He was intimidated\r\nby the issue of his first experiment, and took pains to elude or\r\ndiscourage my inquiry. My impetuosity some times compelled him to have\r\nresort to misrepresentations and untruths.\r\n\r\nTime effected that end, perhaps, in a more beneficial manner. In the\r\ncourse of my meditations the recollections of the past gradually became\r\nmore distinct. I revolved them, however, in silence, and being no longer\r\naccompanied with surprize, they did not exercise a death-dealing\r\npower. I had discontinued the perusal of the paper in the midst of\r\nthe narrative; but what I read, combined with information elsewhere\r\nobtained, threw, perhaps, a sufficient light upon these detestable\r\ntransactions; yet my curiosity was not inactive. I desired to peruse the\r\nremainder.\r\n\r\nMy eagerness to know the particulars of this tale was mingled and abated\r\nby my antipathy to the scene which would be disclosed. Hence I employed\r\nno means to effect my purpose. I desired knowledge, and, at the same\r\ntime, shrunk back from receiving the boon.\r\n\r\nOne morning, being left alone, I rose from my bed, and went to a drawer\r\nwhere my finer clothing used to be kept. I opened it, and this fatal\r\npaper saluted my sight. I snatched it involuntarily, and withdrew to a\r\nchair. I debated, for a few minutes, whether I should open and read. Now\r\nthat my fortitude was put to trial, it failed. I felt myself incapable\r\nof deliberately surveying a scene of so much horror. I was prompted to\r\nreturn it to its place, but this resolution gave way, and I determined\r\nto peruse some part of it. I turned over the leaves till I came near the\r\nconclusion. The narrative of the criminal was finished. The verdict of\r\nGUILTY reluctantly pronounced by the jury, and the accused interrogated\r\nwhy sentence of death should not pass. The answer was brief, solemn, and\r\nemphatical.\r\n\r\n\"No. I have nothing to say. My tale has been told. My motives have\r\nbeen truly stated. If my judges are unable to discern the purity of my\r\nintentions, or to credit the statement of them, which I have just made;\r\nif they see not that my deed was enjoined by heaven; that obedience was\r\nthe test of perfect virtue, and the extinction of selfishness and error,\r\nthey must pronounce me a murderer.\r\n\r\n\"They refuse to credit my tale; they impute my acts to the influence of\r\ndaemons; they account me an example of the highest wickedness of which\r\nhuman nature is capable; they doom me to death and infamy. Have I power\r\nto escape this evil? If I have, be sure I will exert it. I will not\r\naccept evil at their hand, when I am entitled to good; I will suffer\r\nonly when I cannot elude suffering.\r\n\r\n\"You say that I am guilty. Impious and rash! thus to usurp the\r\nprerogatives of your Maker! to set up your bounded views and halting\r\nreason, as the measure of truth!\r\n\r\n\"Thou, Omnipotent and Holy! Thou knowest that my actions were\r\nconformable to thy will. I know not what is crime; what actions are\r\nevil in their ultimate and comprehensive tendency or what are good. Thy\r\nknowledge, as thy power, is unlimited. I have taken thee for my guide,\r\nand cannot err. To the arms of thy protection, I entrust my safety. In\r\nthe awards of thy justice, I confide for my recompense.\r\n\r\n\"Come death when it will, I am safe. Let calumny and abhorrence pursue\r\nme among men; I shall not be defrauded of my dues. The peace of virtue,\r\nand the glory of obedience, will be my portion hereafter.\"\r\n\r\nHere ended the speaker. I withdrew my eyes from the page; but before I\r\nhad time to reflect on what I had read, Mr. Cambridge entered the\r\nroom. He quickly perceived how I had been employed, and betrayed some\r\nsolicitude respecting the condition of my mind.\r\n\r\nHis fears, however, were superfluous. What I had read, threw me into a\r\nstate not easily described. Anguish and fury, however, had no part in\r\nit. My faculties were chained up in wonder and awe. Just then, I was\r\nunable to speak. I looked at my friend with an air of inquisitiveness,\r\nand pointed at the roll. He comprehended my inquiry, and answered me\r\nwith looks of gloomy acquiescence. After some time, my thoughts found\r\ntheir way to my lips.\r\n\r\nSuch then were the acts of my brother. Such were his words. For this\r\nhe was condemned to die: To die upon the gallows! A fate, cruel and\r\nunmerited! And is it so? continued I, struggling for utterance, which\r\nthis new idea made difficult; is he--dead!\r\n\r\n\"No. He is alive. There could be no doubt as to the cause of these\r\nexcesses. They originated in sudden madness; but that madness continues.\r\nand he is condemned to perpetual imprisonment.\"\r\n\r\n\"Madness, say you? Are you sure? Were not these sights, and these\r\nsounds, really seen and heard?\"\r\n\r\nMy uncle was surprized at my question. He looked at me with apparent\r\ninquietude. \"Can you doubt,\" said he, \"that these were illusions? Does\r\nheaven, think you, interfere for such ends?\"\r\n\r\n\"O no; I think it not. Heaven cannot stimulate to such unheard-of\r\noutrage. The agent was not good, but evil.\"\r\n\r\n\"Nay, my dear girl,\" said my friend, \"lay aside these fancies. Neither\r\nangel nor devil had any part in this affair.\"\r\n\r\n\"You misunderstand me,\" I answered; \"I believe the agency to be external\r\nand real, but not supernatural.\"\r\n\r\n\"Indeed!\" said he, in an accent of surprize. \"Whom do you then suppose\r\nto be the agent?\"\r\n\r\n\"I know not. All is wildering conjecture. I cannot forget Carwin. I\r\ncannot banish the suspicion that he was the setter of these snares. But\r\nhow can we suppose it to be madness? Did insanity ever before assume\r\nthis form?\"\r\n\r\n\"Frequently. The illusion, in this case, was more dreadful in its\r\nconsequences, than any that has come to my knowledge; but, I repeat that\r\nsimilar illusions are not rare. Did you never hear of an instance which\r\noccurred in your mother's family?\"\r\n\r\n\"No. I beseech you relate it. My grandfather's death I have understood\r\nto have been extraordinary, but I know not in what respect. A brother,\r\nto whom he was much attached, died in his youth, and this, as I have\r\nheard, influenced, in some remarkable way, the fate of my grandfather;\r\nbut I am unacquainted with particulars.\"\r\n\r\n\"On the death of that brother,\" resumed my friend, \"my father was seized\r\nwith dejection, which was found to flow from two sources. He not only\r\ngrieved for the loss of a friend, but entertained the belief that his\r\nown death would be inevitably consequent on that of his brother. He\r\nwaited from day to day in expectation of the stroke which he predicted\r\nwas speedily to fall upon him. Gradually, however, he recovered his\r\ncheerfulness and confidence. He married, and performed his part in\r\nthe world with spirit and activity. At the end of twenty-one years it\r\nhappened that he spent the summer with his family at an house which he\r\npossessed on the sea coast in Cornwall. It was at no great distance\r\nfrom a cliff which overhung the ocean, and rose into the air to a great\r\nheight. The summit was level and secure, and easily ascended on the land\r\nside. The company frequently repaired hither in clear weather, invited\r\nby its pure airs and extensive prospects. One evening in June my father,\r\nwith his wife and some friends, chanced to be on this spot. Every one\r\nwas happy, and my father's imagination seemed particularly alive to the\r\ngrandeur of the scenery.\r\n\r\n\"Suddenly, however, his limbs trembled and his features betrayed alarm.\r\nHe threw himself into the attitude of one listening. He gazed earnestly\r\nin a direction in which nothing was visible to his friends. This lasted\r\nfor a minute; then turning to his companions, he told them that his\r\nbrother had just delivered to him a summons, which must be instantly\r\nobeyed. He then took an hasty and solemn leave of each person, and,\r\nbefore their surprize would allow them to understand the scene, he\r\nrushed to the edge of the cliff, threw himself headlong, and was seen no\r\nmore.\r\n\r\n\"In the course of my practice in the German army, many cases, equally\r\nremarkable, have occurred. Unquestionably the illusions were maniacal,\r\nthough the vulgar thought otherwise. They are all reducible to one\r\nclass, [*] and are not more difficult of explication and cure than most\r\naffections of our frame.\"\r\n\r\nThis opinion my uncle endeavoured, by various means, to impress upon me.\r\nI listened to his reasonings and illustrations with silent respect. My\r\nastonishment was great on finding proofs of an influence of which I\r\nhad supposed there were no examples; but I was far from accounting for\r\nappearances in my uncle's manner. Ideas thronged into my mind which I\r\nwas unable to disjoin or to regulate. I reflected that this madness,\r\nif madness it were, had affected Pleyel and myself as well as Wieland.\r\nPleyel had heard a mysterious voice. I had seen and heard. A form had\r\nshowed itself to me as well as to Wieland. The disclosure had been\r\nmade in the same spot. The appearance was equally complete and equally\r\nprodigious in both instances. Whatever supposition I should adopt, had\r\nI not equal reason to tremble? What was my security against influences\r\nequally terrific and equally irresistable?\r\n\r\nIt would be vain to attempt to describe the state of mind which this\r\nidea produced. I wondered at the change which a moment had affected\r\nin my brother's condition. Now was I stupified with tenfold wonder in\r\ncontemplating myself. Was I not likewise transformed from rational and\r\nhuman into a creature of nameless and fearful attributes? Was I not\r\ntransported to the brink of the same abyss? Ere a new day should come,\r\nmy hands might be embrued in blood, and my remaining life be consigned\r\nto a dungeon and chains.\r\n\r\nWith moral sensibility like mine, no wonder that this new dread was more\r\ninsupportable than the anguish I had lately endured. Grief carries its\r\nown antidote along with it. When thought becomes merely a vehicle of\r\npain, its progress must be stopped. Death is a cure which nature or\r\nourselves must administer: To this cure I now looked forward with gloomy\r\nsatisfaction.\r\n\r\nMy silence could not conceal from my uncle the state of my thoughts.\r\nHe made unwearied efforts to divert my attention from views so\r\npregnant with danger. His efforts, aided by time, were in some measure\r\nsuccessful. Confidence in the strength of my resolution, and in the\r\nhealthful state of my faculties, was once more revived. I was able\r\nto devote my thoughts to my brother's state, and the causes of this\r\ndisasterous proceeding.\r\n\r\nMy opinions were the sport of eternal change. Some times I conceived the\r\napparition to be more than human. I had no grounds on which to build a\r\ndisbelief. I could not deny faith to the evidence of my religion;\r\nthe testimony of men was loud and unanimous: both these concurred\r\nto persuade me that evil spirits existed, and that their energy was\r\nfrequently exerted in the system of the world.\r\n\r\nThese ideas connected themselves with the image of Carwin. Where is the\r\nproof, said I, that daemons may not be subjected to the controul of men?\r\nThis truth may be distorted and debased in the minds of the ignorant.\r\nThe dogmas of the vulgar, with regard to this subject, are glaringly\r\nabsurd; but though these may justly be neglected by the wise, we are\r\nscarcely justified in totally rejecting the possibility that men may\r\nobtain supernatural aid.\r\n\r\nThe dreams of superstition are worthy of contempt. Witchcraft, its\r\ninstruments and miracles, the compact ratified by a bloody signature,\r\nthe apparatus of sulpherous smells and thundering explosions, are\r\nmonstrous and chimerical. These have no part in the scene over which the\r\ngenius of Carwin presides. That conscious beings, dissimilar from human,\r\nbut moral and voluntary agents as we are, some where exist, can scarcely\r\nbe denied. That their aid may be employed to benign or malignant\r\npurposes, cannot be disproved.\r\n\r\nDarkness rests upon the designs of this man. The extent of his power is\r\nunknown; but is there not evidence that it has been now exerted?\r\n\r\nI recurred to my own experience. Here Carwin had actually appeared upon\r\nthe stage; but this was in a human character. A voice and a form were\r\ndiscovered; but one was apparently exerted, and the other disclosed, not\r\nto befriend, but to counteract Carwin's designs. There were tokens of\r\nhostility, and not of alliance, between them. Carwin was the miscreant\r\nwhose projects were resisted by a minister of heaven. How can this be\r\nreconciled to the stratagem which ruined my brother? There the agency\r\nwas at once preternatural and malignant.\r\n\r\nThe recollection of this fact led my thoughts into a new channel. The\r\nmalignity of that influence which governed my brother had hitherto been\r\nno subject of doubt. His wife and children were destroyed; they had\r\nexpired in agony and fear; yet was it indisputably certain that their\r\nmurderer was criminal? He was acquitted at the tribunal of his own\r\nconscience; his behaviour at his trial and since, was faithfully\r\nreported to me; appearances were uniform; not for a moment did he lay\r\naside the majesty of virtue; he repelled all invectives by appealing to\r\nthe deity, and to the tenor of his past life; surely there was truth in\r\nthis appeal: none but a command from heaven could have swayed his will;\r\nand nothing but unerring proof of divine approbation could sustain his\r\nmind in its present elevation.\r\n\r\n\r\n     * Mania Mutabilis. See Darwin's Zoonomia, vol. ii. Class III.\r\n     1.2. where similar cases are stated.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter XXI\r\n\r\n\r\nSuch, for some time, was the course of my meditations. My weakness, and\r\nmy aversion to be pointed at as an object of surprize or compassion,\r\nprevented me from going into public. I studiously avoided the visits of\r\nthose who came to express their sympathy, or gratify their curiosity.\r\nMy uncle was my principal companion. Nothing more powerfully tended to\r\nconsole me than his conversation.\r\n\r\nWith regard to Pleyel, my feelings seemed to have undergone a total\r\nrevolution. It often happens that one passion supplants another. Late\r\ndisasters had rent my heart, and now that the wound was in some degree\r\nclosed, the love which I had cherished for this man seemed likewise to\r\nhave vanished.\r\n\r\nHitherto, indeed, I had had no cause for despair. I was innocent of that\r\noffence which had estranged him from my presence. I might reasonably\r\nexpect that my innocence would at some time be irresistably\r\ndemonstrated, and his affection for me be revived with his esteem. Now\r\nmy aversion to be thought culpable by him continued, but was unattended\r\nwith the same impatience. I desired the removal of his suspicions,\r\nnot for the sake of regaining his love, but because I delighted in the\r\nveneration of so excellent a man, and because he himself would derive\r\npleasure from conviction of my integrity.\r\n\r\nMy uncle had early informed me that Pleyel and he had seen each other,\r\nsince the return of the latter from Europe. Amidst the topics of their\r\nconversation, I discovered that Pleyel had carefully omitted the mention\r\nof those events which had drawn upon me so much abhorrence. I could\r\nnot account for his silence on this subject. Perhaps time or some new\r\ndiscovery had altered or shaken his opinion. Perhaps he was unwilling,\r\nthough I were guilty, to injure me in the opinion of my venerable\r\nkinsman. I understood that he had frequently visited me during\r\nmy disease, had watched many successive nights by my bedside, and\r\nmanifested the utmost anxiety on my account.\r\n\r\nThe journey which he was preparing to take, at the termination of our\r\nlast interview, the catastrophe of the ensuing night induced him to\r\ndelay. The motives of this journey I had, till now, totally mistaken.\r\nThey were explained to me by my uncle, whose tale excited my\r\nastonishment without awakening my regret. In a different state of mind,\r\nit would have added unspeakably to my distress, but now it was more\r\na source of pleasure than pain. This, perhaps, is not the least\r\nextraordinary of the facts contained in this narrative. It will excite\r\nless wonder when I add, that my indifference was temporary, and that the\r\nlapse of a few days shewed me that my feelings were deadened for a time,\r\nrather than finally extinguished.\r\n\r\nTheresa de Stolberg was alive. She had conceived the resolution of\r\nseeking her lover in America. To conceal her flight, she had caused the\r\nreport of her death to be propagated. She put herself under the conduct\r\nof Bertrand, the faithful servant of Pleyel. The pacquet which the\r\nlatter received from the hands of his servant, contained the tidings of\r\nher safe arrival at Boston, and to meet her there was the purpose of his\r\njourney.\r\n\r\nThis discovery had set this man's character in a new light. I had\r\nmistaken the heroism of friendship for the phrenzy of love. He who\r\nhad gained my affections, may be supposed to have previously entitled\r\nhimself to my reverence; but the levity which had formerly characterized\r\nthe behaviour of this man, tended to obscure the greatness of his\r\nsentiments. I did not fail to remark, that since this lady was still\r\nalive, the voice in the temple which asserted her death, must either\r\nhave been intended to deceive, or have been itself deceived. The latter\r\nsupposition was inconsistent with the notion of a spiritual, and the\r\nformer with that of a benevolent being.\r\n\r\nWhen my disease abated, Pleyel had forborne his visits, and had lately\r\nset out upon this journey. This amounted to a proof that my guilt was\r\nstill believed by him. I was grieved for his errors, but trusted that my\r\nvindication would, sooner or later, be made.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, tumultuous thoughts were again set afloat by a proposal\r\nmade to me by my uncle. He imagined that new airs would restore my\r\nlanguishing constitution, and a varied succession of objects tend to\r\nrepair the shock which my mind had received. For this end, he proposed\r\nto me to take up my abode with him in France or Italy.\r\n\r\nAt a more prosperous period, this scheme would have pleased for its own\r\nsake. Now my heart sickened at the prospect of nature. The world of man\r\nwas shrowded in misery and blood, and constituted a loathsome spectacle.\r\nI willingly closed my eyes in sleep, and regretted that the respite it\r\nafforded me was so short. I marked with satisfaction the progress of\r\ndecay in my frame, and consented to live, merely in the hope that\r\nthe course of nature would speedily relieve me from the burthen.\r\nNevertheless, as he persisted in his scheme, I concurred in it merely\r\nbecause he was entitled to my gratitude, and because my refusal gave him\r\npain.\r\n\r\nNo sooner was he informed of my consent, than he told me I must make\r\nimmediate preparation to embark, as the ship in which he had engaged\r\na passage would be ready to depart in three days. This expedition was\r\nunexpected. There was an impatience in his manner when he urged the\r\nnecessity of dispatch that excited my surprize. When I questioned him as\r\nto the cause of this haste, he generally stated reasons which, at\r\nthat time, I could not deny to be plausible; but which, on the review,\r\nappeared insufficient. I suspected that the true motives were concealed,\r\nand believed that these motives had some connection with my brother's\r\ndestiny.\r\n\r\nI now recollected that the information respecting Wieland which had,\r\nfrom time to time, been imparted to me, was always accompanied with airs\r\nof reserve and mysteriousness. What had appeared sufficiently explicit\r\nat the time it was uttered, I now remembered to have been faltering\r\nand ambiguous. I was resolved to remove my doubts, by visiting the\r\nunfortunate man in his dungeon.\r\n\r\nHeretofore the idea of this visit had occurred to me; but the horrors\r\nof his dwelling-place, his wild yet placid physiognomy, his neglected\r\nlocks, the fetters which constrained his limbs, terrible as they were in\r\ndescription, how could I endure to behold!\r\n\r\nNow, however, that I was preparing to take an everlasting farewell of my\r\ncountry, now that an ocean was henceforth to separate me from him, how\r\ncould I part without an interview? I would examine his situation with my\r\nown eyes. I would know whether the representations which had been made\r\nto me were true. Perhaps the sight of the sister whom he was wont\r\nto love with a passion more than fraternal, might have an auspicious\r\ninfluence on his malady.\r\n\r\nHaving formed this resolution, I waited to communicate it to Mr.\r\nCambridge. I was aware that, without his concurrence, I could not hope\r\nto carry it into execution, and could discover no objection to which\r\nit was liable. If I had not been deceived as to his condition, no\r\ninconvenience could arise from this proceeding. His consent, therefore,\r\nwould be the test of his sincerity.\r\n\r\nI seized this opportunity to state my wishes on this head. My suspicions\r\nwere confirmed by the manner in which my request affected him. After\r\nsome pause, in which his countenance betrayed every mark of perplexity,\r\nhe said to me, \"Why would you pay this visit? What useful purpose can it\r\nserve?\"\r\n\r\n\"We are preparing,\" said I, \"to leave the country forever: What kind of\r\nbeing should I be to leave behind me a brother in calamity without even\r\na parting interview? Indulge me for three minutes in the sight of him.\r\nMy heart will be much easier after I have looked at him, and shed a few\r\ntears in his presence.\"\r\n\r\n\"I believe otherwise. The sight of him would only augment your distress,\r\nwithout contributing, in any degree, to his benefit.\"\r\n\r\n\"I know not that,\" returned I. \"Surely the sympathy of his sister,\r\nproofs that her tenderness is as lively as ever, must be a source\r\nof satisfaction to him. At present he must regard all mankind as his\r\nenemies and calumniators. His sister he, probably, conceives to partake\r\nin the general infatuation, and to join in the cry of abhorrence that\r\nis raised against him. To be undeceived in this respect, to be assured\r\nthat, however I may impute his conduct to delusion, I still retain all\r\nmy former affection for his person, and veneration for the purity of his\r\nmotives, cannot but afford him pleasure. When he hears that I have left\r\nthe country, without even the ceremonious attention of a visit, what\r\nwill he think of me? His magnanimity may hinder him from repining, but\r\nhe will surely consider my behaviour as savage and unfeeling. Indeed,\r\ndear Sir, I must pay this visit. To embark with you without paying it,\r\nwill be impossible. It may be of no service to him, but will enable me\r\nto acquit myself of what I cannot but esteem a duty. Besides,\" continued\r\nI, \"if it be a mere fit of insanity that has seized him, may not my\r\npresence chance to have a salutary influence? The mere sight of me, it\r\nis not impossible, may rectify his perceptions.\"\r\n\r\n\"Ay,\" said my uncle, with some eagerness; \"it is by no means impossible\r\nthat your interview may have that effect; and for that reason, beyond\r\nall others, would I dissuade you from it.\"\r\n\r\nI expressed my surprize at this declaration. \"Is it not to be desired\r\nthat an error so fatal as this should be rectified?\"\r\n\r\n\"I wonder at your question. Reflect on the consequences of this error.\r\nHas he not destroyed the wife whom he loved, the children whom he\r\nidolized? What is it that enables him to bear the remembrance, but the\r\nbelief that he acted as his duty enjoined? Would you rashly bereave him\r\nof this belief? Would you restore him to himself, and convince him\r\nthat he was instigated to this dreadful outrage by a perversion of his\r\norgans, or a delusion from hell?\r\n\r\n\"Now his visions are joyous and elate. He conceives himself to have\r\nreached a loftier degree of virtue, than any other human being. The\r\nmerit of his sacrifice is only enhanced in the eyes of superior beings,\r\nby the detestation that pursues him here, and the sufferings to which he\r\nis condemned. The belief that even his sister has deserted him, and\r\ngone over to his enemies, adds to his sublimity of feelings, and his\r\nconfidence in divine approbation and future recompense.\r\n\r\n\"Let him be undeceived in this respect, and what floods of despair and\r\nof horror will overwhelm him! Instead of glowing approbation and serene\r\nhope, will he not hate and torture himself? Self-violence, or a phrenzy\r\nfar more savage and destructive than this, may be expected to succeed. I\r\nbeseech you, therefore, to relinquish this scheme. If you calmly reflect\r\nupon it, you will discover that your duty lies in carefully shunning\r\nhim.\"\r\n\r\nMr. Cambridge's reasonings suggested views to my understanding, that had\r\nnot hitherto occurred. I could not but admit their validity, but they\r\nshewed, in a new light, the depth of that misfortune in which my brother\r\nwas plunged. I was silent and irresolute.\r\n\r\nPresently, I considered, that whether Wieland was a maniac, a faithful\r\nservant of his God, the victim of hellish illusions, or the dupe of\r\nhuman imposture, was by no means certain. In this state of my mind it\r\nbecame me to be silent during the visit that I projected. This visit\r\nshould be brief: I should be satisfied merely to snatch a look at him.\r\nAdmitting that a change in his opinions were not to be desired, there\r\nwas no danger from the conduct which I should pursue, that this change\r\nshould be wrought.\r\n\r\nBut I could not conquer my uncle's aversion to this scheme. Yet I\r\npersisted, and he found that to make me voluntarily relinquish it, it\r\nwas necessary to be more explicit than he had hitherto been. He took\r\nboth my hands, and anxiously examining my countenance as he spoke,\r\n\"Clara,\" said he, \"this visit must not be paid. We must hasten with the\r\nutmost expedition from this shore. It is folly to conceal the truth\r\nfrom you, and, since it is only by disclosing the truth that you can be\r\nprevailed upon to lay aside this project, the truth shall be told.\r\n\r\n\"O my dear girl!\" continued he with increasing energy in his accent,\r\n\"your brother's phrenzy is, indeed, stupendous and frightful. The soul\r\nthat formerly actuated his frame has disappeared. The same form remains;\r\nbut the wise and benevolent Wieland is no more. A fury that is rapacious\r\nof blood, that lifts his strength almost above that of mortals, that\r\nbends all his energies to the destruction of whatever was once dear to\r\nhim, possesses him wholly.\r\n\r\n\"You must not enter his dungeon; his eyes will no sooner be fixed upon\r\nyou, than an exertion of his force will be made. He will shake off his\r\nfetters in a moment, and rush upon you. No interposition will then be\r\nstrong or quick enough to save you.\r\n\r\n\"The phantom that has urged him to the murder of Catharine and her\r\nchildren is not yet appeased. Your life, and that of Pleyel, are exacted\r\nfrom him by this imaginary being. He is eager to comply with this\r\ndemand. Twice he has escaped from his prison. The first time, he no\r\nsooner found himself at liberty, than he hasted to Pleyel's house. It\r\nbeing midnight, the latter was in bed. Wieland penetrated unobserved\r\nto his chamber, and opened his curtain. Happily, Pleyel awoke at the\r\ncritical moment, and escaped the fury of his kinsman, by leaping from\r\nhis chamber-window into the court. Happily, he reached the ground\r\nwithout injury. Alarms were given, and after diligent search, your\r\nbrother was found in a chamber of your house, whither, no doubt, he\r\nhad sought you. His chains, and the watchfulness of his guards, were\r\nredoubled; but again, by some miracle, he restored himself to liberty.\r\nHe was now incautiously apprized of the place of your abode: and had not\r\ninformation of his escape been instantly given, your death would have\r\nbeen added to the number of his atrocious acts.\r\n\r\n\"You now see the danger of your project. You must not only forbear to\r\nvisit him, but if you would save him from the crime of embruing his\r\nhands in your blood, you must leave the country. There is no hope that\r\nhis malady will end but with his life, and no precaution will ensure\r\nyour safety, but that of placing the ocean between you.\r\n\r\n\"I confess I came over with an intention to reside among you, but\r\nthese disasters have changed my views. Your own safety and my happiness\r\nrequire that you should accompany me in my return, and I entreat you to\r\ngive your cheerful concurrence to this measure.\"\r\n\r\nAfter these representations from my uncle, it was impossible to retain\r\nmy purpose. I readily consented to seclude myself from Wieland's\r\npresence. I likewise acquiesced in the proposal to go to Europe; not\r\nthat I ever expected to arrive there, but because, since my principles\r\nforbad me to assail my own life, change had some tendency to make\r\nsupportable the few days which disease should spare to me.\r\n\r\nWhat a tale had thus been unfolded! I was hunted to death, not by\r\none whom my misconduct had exasperated, who was conscious of illicit\r\nmotives, and who sought his end by circumvention and surprize; but by\r\none who deemed himself commissioned for this act by heaven; who\r\nregarded this career of horror as the last refinement of virtue; whose\r\nimplacability was proportioned to the reverence and love which he felt\r\nfor me, and who was inaccessible to the fear of punishment and ignominy!\r\n\r\nIn vain should I endeavour to stay his hand by urging the claims of\r\na sister or friend: these were his only reasons for pursuing my\r\ndestruction. Had I been a stranger to his blood; had I been the most\r\nworthless of human kind; my safety had not been endangered.\r\n\r\nSurely, said I, my fate is without example. The phrenzy which is charged\r\nupon my brother, must belong to myself. My foe is manacled and guarded;\r\nbut I derive no security from these restraints. I live not in a\r\ncommunity of savages; yet, whether I sit or walk, go into crouds,\r\nor hide myself in solitude, my life is marked for a prey to inhuman\r\nviolence; I am in perpetual danger of perishing; of perishing under the\r\ngrasp of a brother!\r\n\r\nI recollected the omens of this destiny; I remembered the gulf to which\r\nmy brother's invitation had conducted me; I remembered that, when on the\r\nbrink of danger, the author of my peril was depicted by my fears in\r\nhis form: Thus realized, were the creatures of prophetic sleep, and of\r\nwakeful terror!\r\n\r\nThese images were unavoidably connected with that of Carwin. In\r\nthis paroxysm of distress, my attention fastened on him as the grand\r\ndeceiver; the author of this black conspiracy; the intelligence that\r\ngoverned in this storm.\r\n\r\nSome relief is afforded in the midst of suffering, when its author is\r\ndiscovered or imagined; and an object found on which we may pour out\r\nour indignation and our vengeance. I ran over the events that had taken\r\nplace since the origin of our intercourse with him, and reflected on the\r\ntenor of that description which was received from Ludloe. Mixed up with\r\nnotions of supernatural agency, were the vehement suspicions which I\r\nentertained, that Carwin was the enemy whose machinations had destroyed\r\nus.\r\n\r\nI thirsted for knowledge and for vengeance. I regarded my hasty\r\ndeparture with reluctance, since it would remove me from the means by\r\nwhich this knowledge might be obtained, and this vengeance gratified.\r\nThis departure was to take place in two days. At the end of two days\r\nI was to bid an eternal adieu to my native country. Should I not pay a\r\nparting visit to the scene of these disasters? Should I not bedew with\r\nmy tears the graves of my sister and her children? Should I not explore\r\ntheir desolate habitation, and gather from the sight of its walls and\r\nfurniture food for my eternal melancholy?\r\n\r\nThis suggestion was succeeded by a secret shuddering. Some disastrous\r\ninfluence appeared to overhang the scene. How many memorials should I\r\nmeet with serving to recall the images of those I had lost!\r\n\r\nI was tempted to relinquish my design, when it occurred to me that I\r\nhad left among my papers a journal of transactions in shorthand. I\r\nwas employed in this manuscript on that night when Pleyel's incautious\r\ncuriosity tempted him to look over my shoulder. I was then recording my\r\nadventure in THE RECESS, an imperfect sight of which led him into such\r\nfatal errors.\r\n\r\nI had regulated the disposition of all my property. This manuscript,\r\nhowever, which contained the most secret transactions of my life, I was\r\ndesirous of destroying. For this end I must return to my house, and this\r\nI immediately determined to do.\r\n\r\nI was not willing to expose myself to opposition from my friends,\r\nby mentioning my design; I therefore bespoke the use of Mr. Hallet's\r\nchaise, under pretence of enjoying an airing, as the day was remarkably\r\nbright.\r\n\r\nThis request was gladly complied with, and I directed the servant to\r\nconduct me to Mettingen. I dismissed him at the gate, intending to use,\r\nin returning, a carriage belonging to my brother.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter XXII\r\n\r\n\r\nThe inhabitants of the HUT received me with a mixture of joy and\r\nsurprize. Their homely welcome, and their artless sympathy, were\r\ngrateful to my feelings. In the midst of their inquiries, as to my\r\nhealth, they avoided all allusions to the source of my malady. They were\r\nhonest creatures, and I loved them well. I participated in the tears\r\nwhich they shed when I mentioned to them my speedy departure for Europe,\r\nand promised to acquaint them with my welfare during my long absence.\r\n\r\nThey expressed great surprize when I informed them of my intention to\r\nvisit my cottage. Alarm and foreboding overspread their features, and\r\nthey attempted to dissuade me from visiting an house which they firmly\r\nbelieved to be haunted by a thousand ghastly apparitions.\r\n\r\nThese apprehensions, however, had no power over my conduct. I took an\r\nirregular path which led me to my own house. All was vacant and forlorn.\r\nA small enclosure, near which the path led, was the burying-ground\r\nbelonging to the family. This I was obliged to pass. Once I had intended\r\nto enter it, and ponder on the emblems and inscriptions which my uncle\r\nhad caused to be made on the tombs of Catharine and her children; but\r\nnow my heart faltered as I approached, and I hastened forward, that\r\ndistance might conceal it from my view.\r\n\r\nWhen I approached the recess, my heart again sunk. I averted my eyes,\r\nand left it behind me as quickly as possible. Silence reigned through\r\nmy habitation, and a darkness which closed doors and shutters produced.\r\nEvery object was connected with mine or my brother's history. I passed\r\nthe entry, mounted the stair, and unlocked the door of my chamber.\r\nIt was with difficulty that I curbed my fancy and smothered my fears.\r\nSlight movements and casual sounds were transformed into beckoning\r\nshadows and calling shapes.\r\n\r\nI proceeded to the closet. I opened and looked round it with\r\nfearfulness. All things were in their accustomed order. I sought and\r\nfound the manuscript where I was used to deposit it. This being secured,\r\nthere was nothing to detain me; yet I stood and contemplated awhile the\r\nfurniture and walls of my chamber. I remembered how long this apartment\r\nhad been a sweet and tranquil asylum; I compared its former state with\r\nits present dreariness, and reflected that I now beheld it for the last\r\ntime.\r\n\r\nHere it was that the incomprehensible behaviour of Carwin was witnessed:\r\nthis the stage on which that enemy of man shewed himself for a moment\r\nunmasked. Here the menaces of murder were wafted to my ear; and here\r\nthese menaces were executed.\r\n\r\nThese thoughts had a tendency to take from me my self-command. My feeble\r\nlimbs refused to support me, and I sunk upon a chair. Incoherent and\r\nhalf-articulate exclamations escaped my lips. The name of Carwin was\r\nuttered, and eternal woes, woes like that which his malice had entailed\r\nupon us, were heaped upon him. I invoked all-seeing heaven to drag to\r\nlight and to punish this betrayer, and accused its providence for having\r\nthus long delayed the retribution that was due to so enormous a guilt.\r\n\r\nI have said that the window shutters were closed. A feeble light,\r\nhowever, found entrance through the crevices. A small window illuminated\r\nthe closet, and the door being closed, a dim ray streamed through\r\nthe key-hole. A kind of twilight was thus created, sufficient for the\r\npurposes of vision; but, at the same time, involving all minuter objects\r\nin obscurity.\r\n\r\nThis darkness suited the colour of my thoughts. I sickened at the\r\nremembrance of the past. The prospect of the future excited my loathing.\r\nI muttered in a low voice, Why should I live longer? Why should I drag a\r\nmiserable being? All, for whom I ought to live, have perished. Am I not\r\nmyself hunted to death?\r\n\r\nAt that moment, my despair suddenly became vigorous. My nerves were no\r\nlonger unstrung. My powers, that had long been deadened, were revived.\r\nMy bosom swelled with a sudden energy, and the conviction darted through\r\nmy mind, that to end my torments was, at once, practicable and wise.\r\n\r\nI knew how to find way to the recesses of life. I could use a lancet\r\nwith some skill, and could distinguish between vein and artery. By\r\npiercing deep into the latter, I should shun the evils which the future\r\nhad in store for me, and take refuge from my woes in quiet death.\r\n\r\nI started on my feet, for my feebleness was gone, and hasted to the\r\ncloset. A lancet and other small instruments were preserved in a\r\ncase which I had deposited here. Inattentive as I was to foreign\r\nconsiderations, my ears were still open to any sound of mysterious\r\nimport that should occur. I thought I heard a step in the entry. My\r\npurpose was suspended, and I cast an eager glance at my chamber door,\r\nwhich was open. No one appeared, unless the shadow which I discerned\r\nupon the floor, was the outline of a man. If it were, I was authorized\r\nto suspect that some one was posted close to the entrance, who possibly\r\nhad overheard my exclamations.\r\n\r\nMy teeth chattered, and a wild confusion took place of my momentary\r\ncalm. Thus it was when a terrific visage had disclosed itself on a\r\nformer night. Thus it was when the evil destiny of Wieland assumed the\r\nlineaments of something human. What horrid apparition was preparing to\r\nblast my sight?\r\n\r\nStill I listened and gazed. Not long, for the shadow moved; a foot,\r\nunshapely and huge, was thrust forward; a form advanced from its\r\nconcealment, and stalked into the room. It was Carwin! While I had\r\nbreath I shrieked. While I had power over my muscles, I motioned with\r\nmy hand that he should vanish. My exertions could not last long; I sunk\r\ninto a fit.\r\n\r\nO that this grateful oblivion had lasted for ever! Too quickly I\r\nrecovered my senses. The power of distinct vision was no sooner restored\r\nto me, than this hateful form again presented itself, and I once more\r\nrelapsed.\r\n\r\nA second time, untoward nature recalled me from the sleep of death.\r\nI found myself stretched upon the bed. When I had power to look up, I\r\nremembered only that I had cause to fear. My distempered fancy fashioned\r\nto itself no distinguishable image. I threw a languid glance round me;\r\nonce more my eyes lighted upon Carwin.\r\n\r\nHe was seated on the floor, his back rested against the wall, his knees\r\nwere drawn up, and his face was buried in his hands. That his station\r\nwas at some distance, that his attitude was not menacing, that his\r\nominous visage was concealed, may account for my now escaping a shock,\r\nviolent as those which were past. I withdrew my eyes, but was not again\r\ndeserted by my senses.\r\n\r\nOn perceiving that I had recovered my sensibility, he lifted his head.\r\nThis motion attracted my attention. His countenance was mild, but sorrow\r\nand astonishment sat upon his features. I averted my eyes and feebly\r\nexclaimed--\"O! fly--fly far and for ever!--I cannot behold you and\r\nlive!\"\r\n\r\nHe did not rise upon his feet, but clasped his hands, and said in a\r\ntone of deprecation--\"I will fly. I am become a fiend, the sight of whom\r\ndestroys. Yet tell me my offence! You have linked curses with my name;\r\nyou ascribe to me a malice monstrous and infernal. I look around; all\r\nis loneliness and desert! This house and your brother's are solitary and\r\ndismantled! You die away at the sight of me! My fear whispers that some\r\ndeed of horror has been perpetrated; that I am the undesigning cause.\"\r\n\r\nWhat language was this? Had he not avowed himself a ravisher? Had not\r\nthis chamber witnessed his atrocious purposes? I besought him with new\r\nvehemence to go.\r\n\r\nHe lifted his eyes--\"Great heaven! what have I done? I think I know\r\nthe extent of my offences. I have acted, but my actions have possibly\r\neffected more than I designed. This fear has brought me back from my\r\nretreat. I come to repair the evil of which my rashness was the cause,\r\nand to prevent more evil. I come to confess my errors.\"\r\n\r\n\"Wretch!\" I cried when my suffocating emotions would permit me to speak,\r\n\"the ghosts of my sister and her children, do they not rise to accuse\r\nthee? Who was it that blasted the intellects of Wieland? Who was it\r\nthat urged him to fury, and guided him to murder? Who, but thou and the\r\ndevil, with whom thou art confederated?\"\r\n\r\nAt these words a new spirit pervaded his countenance. His eyes once more\r\nappealed to heaven. \"If I have memory, if I have being, I am innocent. I\r\nintended no ill; but my folly, indirectly and remotely, may have caused\r\nit; but what words are these! Your brother lunatic! His children dead!\"\r\n\r\nWhat should I infer from this deportment? Was the ignorance which these\r\nwords implied real or pretended?--Yet how could I imagine a mere human\r\nagency in these events? But if the influence was preternatural or\r\nmaniacal in my brother's case, they must be equally so in my own. Then\r\nI remembered that the voice exerted, was to save me from Carwin's\r\nattempts. These ideas tended to abate my abhorrence of this man, and to\r\ndetect the absurdity of my accusations.\r\n\r\n\"Alas!\" said I, \"I have no one to accuse. Leave me to my fate. Fly from\r\na scene stained with cruelty; devoted to despair.\"\r\n\r\nCarwin stood for a time musing and mournful. At length he said, \"What\r\nhas happened? I came to expiate my crimes: let me know them in their\r\nfull extent. I have horrible forebodings! What has happened?\"\r\n\r\nI was silent; but recollecting the intimation given by this man when he\r\nwas detected in my closet, which implied some knowledge of that power\r\nwhich interfered in my favor, I eagerly inquired, \"What was that voice\r\nwhich called upon me to hold when I attempted to open the closet? What\r\nface was that which I saw at the bottom of the stairs? Answer me truly.\"\r\n\r\n\"I came to confess the truth. Your allusions are horrible and strange.\r\nPerhaps I have but faint conceptions of the evils which my infatuation\r\nhas produced; but what remains I will perform. It was my VOICE that you\r\nheard! It was my FACE that you saw!\"\r\n\r\nFor a moment I doubted whether my remembrance of events were not\r\nconfused. How could he be at once stationed at my shoulder and shut up\r\nin my closet? How could he stand near me and yet be invisible? But if\r\nCarwin's were the thrilling voice and the fiery visage which I had heard\r\nand seen, then was he the prompter of my brother, and the author of\r\nthese dismal outrages.\r\n\r\nOnce more I averted my eyes and struggled for speech. \"Begone! thou man\r\nof mischief! Remorseless and implacable miscreant! begone!\"\r\n\r\n\"I will obey,\" said he in a disconsolate voice; \"yet, wretch as I am,\r\nam I unworthy to repair the evils that I have committed? I came as a\r\nrepentant criminal. It is you whom I have injured, and at your bar am\r\nI willing to appear, and confess and expiate my crimes. I have deceived\r\nyou: I have sported with your terrors: I have plotted to destroy your\r\nreputation. I come now to remove your errors; to set you beyond the\r\nreach of similar fears; to rebuild your fame as far as I am able.\r\n\r\n\"This is the amount of my guilt, and this the fruit of my remorse. Will\r\nyou not hear me? Listen to my confession, and then denounce punishment.\r\nAll I ask is a patient audience.\"\r\n\r\n\"What!\" I replied, \"was not thine the voice that commanded my brother to\r\nimbrue his hands in the blood of his children--to strangle that angel of\r\nsweetness his wife? Has he not vowed my death, and the death of Pleyel,\r\nat thy bidding? Hast thou not made him the butcher of his family;\r\nchanged him who was the glory of his species into worse than brute;\r\nrobbed him of reason, and consigned the rest of his days to fetters and\r\nstripes?\"\r\n\r\nCarwin's eyes glared, and his limbs were petrified at this intelligence.\r\nNo words were requisite to prove him guiltless of these enormities: at\r\nthe time, however, I was nearly insensible to these exculpatory tokens.\r\nHe walked to the farther end of the room, and having recovered some\r\ndegree of composure, he spoke--\r\n\r\n\"I am not this villain; I have slain no one; I have prompted none to\r\nslay; I have handled a tool of wonderful efficacy without malignant\r\nintentions, but without caution; ample will be the punishment of my\r\ntemerity, if my conduct has contributed to this evil.\" He paused.--\r\n\r\nI likewise was silent. I struggled to command myself so far as to listen\r\nto the tale which he should tell. Observing this, he continued--\r\n\r\n\"You are not apprized of the existence of a power which I possess. I\r\nknow not by what name to call it. [*] It enables me to mimic exactly the\r\nvoice of another, and to modify the sound so that it shall appear to\r\ncome from what quarter, and be uttered at what distance I please.\r\n\r\n\"I know not that every one possesses this power. Perhaps, though a\r\ncasual position of my organs in my youth shewed me that I possessed\r\nit, it is an art which may be taught to all. Would to God I had died\r\nunknowing of the secret! It has produced nothing but degradation and\r\ncalamity.\r\n\r\n\"For a time the possession of so potent and stupendous an endowment\r\nelated me with pride. Unfortified by principle, subjected to poverty,\r\nstimulated by headlong passions, I made this powerful engine subservient\r\nto the supply of my wants, and the gratification of my vanity. I shall\r\nnot mention how diligently I cultivated this gift, which seemed capable\r\nof unlimited improvement; nor detail the various occasions on which\r\nit was successfully exerted to lead superstition, conquer avarice, or\r\nexcite awe.\r\n\r\n\"I left America, which is my native soil, in my youth. I have been\r\nengaged in various scenes of life, in which my peculiar talent has been\r\nexercised with more or less success. I was finally betrayed by one who\r\ncalled himself my friend, into acts which cannot be justified, though\r\nthey are susceptible of apology.\r\n\r\n\"The perfidy of this man compelled me to withdraw from Europe. I\r\nreturned to my native country, uncertain whether silence and obscurity\r\nwould save me from his malice. I resided in the purlieus of the city. I\r\nput on the garb and assumed the manners of a clown.\r\n\r\n\"My chief recreation was walking. My principal haunts were the lawns\r\nand gardens of Mettingen. In this delightful region the luxuriances\r\nof nature had been chastened by judicious art, and each successive\r\ncontemplation unfolded new enchantments.\r\n\r\n\"I was studious of seclusion: I was satiated with the intercourse of\r\nmankind, and discretion required me to shun their intercourse. For\r\nthese reasons I long avoided the observation of your family, and chiefly\r\nvisited these precincts at night.\r\n\r\n\"I was never weary of admiring the position and ornaments of THE\r\nTEMPLE. Many a night have I passed under its roof, revolving no pleasing\r\nmeditations. When, in my frequent rambles, I perceived this apartment\r\nwas occupied, I gave a different direction to my steps. One evening,\r\nwhen a shower had just passed, judging by the silence that no one\r\nwas within, I ascended to this building. Glancing carelessly round, I\r\nperceived an open letter on the pedestal. To read it was doubtless an\r\noffence against politeness. Of this offence, however, I was guilty.\r\n\r\n\"Scarcely had I gone half through when I was alarmed by the approach\r\nof your brother. To scramble down the cliff on the opposite side\r\nwas impracticable. I was unprepared to meet a stranger. Besides\r\nthe aukwardness attending such an interview in these circumstances,\r\nconcealment was necessary to my safety. A thousand times had I vowed\r\nnever again to employ the dangerous talent which I possessed; but such\r\nwas the force of habit and the influence of present convenience, that I\r\nused this method of arresting his progress and leading him back to the\r\nhouse, with his errand, whatever it was, unperformed. I had often caught\r\nparts, from my station below, of your conversation in this place, and\r\nwas well acquainted with the voice of your sister.\r\n\r\n\"Some weeks after this I was again quietly seated in this recess. The\r\nlateness of the hour secured me, as I thought, from all interruption.\r\nIn this, however, I was mistaken, for Wieland and Pleyel, as I judged by\r\ntheir voices, earnest in dispute, ascended the hill.\r\n\r\n\"I was not sensible that any inconvenience could possibly have flowed\r\nfrom my former exertion; yet it was followed with compunction, because\r\nit was a deviation from a path which I had assigned to myself. Now\r\nmy aversion to this means of escape was enforced by an unauthorized\r\ncuriosity, and by the knowledge of a bushy hollow on the edge of the\r\nhill, where I should be safe from discovery. Into this hollow I thrust\r\nmyself.\r\n\r\n\"The propriety of removal to Europe was the question eagerly discussed.\r\nPleyel intimated that his anxiety to go was augmented by the silence\r\nof Theresa de Stolberg. The temptation to interfere in this dispute was\r\nirresistible. In vain I contended with inveterate habits. I disguised to\r\nmyself the impropriety of my conduct, by recollecting the benefits which\r\nit might produce. Pleyel's proposal was unwise, yet it was enforced\r\nwith plausible arguments and indefatigable zeal. Your brother might be\r\npuzzled and wearied, but could not be convinced. I conceived that\r\nto terminate the controversy in favor of the latter was conferring a\r\nbenefit on all parties. For this end I profited by an opening in the\r\nconversation, and assured them of Catharine's irreconcilable aversion to\r\nthe scheme, and of the death of the Saxon baroness. The latter event\r\nwas merely a conjecture, but rendered extremely probable by Pleyel's\r\nrepresentations. My purpose, you need not be told, was effected.\r\n\r\n\"My passion for mystery, and a species of imposture, which I deemed\r\nharmless, was thus awakened afresh. This second lapse into error made my\r\nrecovery more difficult. I cannot convey to you an adequate idea of\r\nthe kind of gratification which I derived from these exploits; yet I\r\nmeditated nothing. My views were bounded to the passing moment, and\r\ncommonly suggested by the momentary exigence.\r\n\r\n\"I must not conceal any thing. Your principles teach you to abhor a\r\nvoluptuous temper; but, with whatever reluctance, I acknowledge this\r\ntemper to be mine. You imagine your servant Judith to be innocent as\r\nwell as beautiful; but you took her from a family where hypocrisy, as\r\nwell as licentiousness, was wrought into a system. My attention was\r\ncaptivated by her charms, and her principles were easily seen to be\r\nflexible.\r\n\r\n\"Deem me not capable of the iniquity of seduction. Your servant is not\r\ndestitute of feminine and virtuous qualities; but she was taught that\r\nthe best use of her charms consists in the sale of them. My nocturnal\r\nvisits to Mettingen were now prompted by a double view, and my\r\ncorrespondence with your servant gave me, at all times, access to your\r\nhouse.\r\n\r\n\"The second night after our interview, so brief and so little foreseen\r\nby either of us, some daemon of mischief seized me. According to my\r\ncompanion's report, your perfections were little less than divine. Her\r\nuncouth but copious narratives converted you into an object of worship.\r\nShe chiefly dwelt upon your courage, because she herself was deficient\r\nin that quality. You held apparitions and goblins in contempt. You took\r\nno precautions against robbers. You were just as tranquil and secure in\r\nthis lonely dwelling, as if you were in the midst of a crowd. Hence a\r\nvague project occurred to me, to put this courage to the test. A woman\r\ncapable of recollection in danger, of warding off groundless panics,\r\nof discerning the true mode of proceeding, and profiting by her best\r\nresources, is a prodigy. I was desirous of ascertaining whether you were\r\nsuch an one.\r\n\r\n\"My expedient was obvious and simple: I was to counterfeit a murderous\r\ndialogue; but this was to be so conducted that another, and not\r\nyourself, should appear to be the object. I was not aware of the\r\npossibility that you should appropriate these menaces to yourself. Had\r\nyou been still and listened, you would have heard the struggles and\r\nprayers of the victim, who would likewise have appeared to be shut up in\r\nthe closet, and whose voice would have been Judith's. This scene would\r\nhave been an appeal to your compassion; and the proof of cowardice\r\nor courage which I expected from you, would have been your remaining\r\ninactive in your bed, or your entering the closet with a view to assist\r\nthe sufferer. Some instances which Judith related of your fearlessness\r\nand promptitude made me adopt the latter supposition with some degree of\r\nconfidence.\r\n\r\n\"By the girl's direction I found a ladder, and mounted to your closet\r\nwindow. This is scarcely large enough to admit the head, but it answered\r\nmy purpose too well.\r\n\r\n\"I cannot express my confusion and surprize at your abrupt and\r\nprecipitate flight. I hastily removed the ladder; and, after some pause,\r\ncuriosity and doubts of your safety induced me to follow you. I found\r\nyou stretched on the turf before your brother's door, without sense or\r\nmotion. I felt the deepest regret at this unlooked-for consequence of\r\nmy scheme. I knew not what to do to procure you relief. The idea of\r\nawakening the family naturally presented itself. This emergency was\r\ncritical, and there was no time to deliberate. It was a sudden thought\r\nthat occurred. I put my lips to the key-hole, and sounded an alarm which\r\neffectually roused the sleepers. My organs were naturally forcible, and\r\nhad been improved by long and assiduous exercise.\r\n\r\n\"Long and bitterly did I repent of my scheme. I was somewhat consoled by\r\nreflecting that my purpose had not been evil, and renewed my fruitless\r\nvows never to attempt such dangerous experiments. For some time I\r\nadhered, with laudable forbearance, to this resolution.\r\n\r\n\"My life has been a life of hardship and exposure. In the summer I\r\nprefer to make my bed of the smooth turf, or, at most, the shelter of a\r\nsummer-house suffices. In all my rambles I never found a spot in which\r\nso many picturesque beauties and rural delights were assembled as at\r\nMettingen. No corner of your little domain unites fragrance and secrecy\r\nin so perfect a degree as the recess in the bank. The odour of its\r\nleaves, the coolness of its shade, and the music of its water-fall,\r\nhad early attracted my attention. Here my sadness was converted into\r\npeaceful melancholy--here my slumbers were sound, and my pleasures\r\nenhanced.\r\n\r\n\"As most free from interruption, I chose this as the scene of my\r\nmidnight interviews with Judith. One evening, as the sun declined, I was\r\nseated here, when I was alarmed by your approach. It was with difficulty\r\nthat I effected my escape unnoticed by you.\r\n\r\n\"At the customary hour, I returned to your habitation, and was made\r\nacquainted by Judith, with your unusual absence. I half suspected the\r\ntrue cause, and felt uneasiness at the danger there was that I should be\r\ndeprived of my retreat; or, at least, interrupted in the possession\r\nof it. The girl, likewise, informed me, that among your other\r\nsingularities, it was not uncommon for you to leave your bed, and walk\r\nforth for the sake of night-airs and starlight contemplations.\r\n\r\n\"I desired to prevent this inconvenience. I found you easily swayed\r\nby fear. I was influenced, in my choice of means, by the facility and\r\ncertainty of that to which I had been accustomed. All that I forsaw was,\r\nthat, in future, this spot would be cautiously shunned by you.\r\n\r\n\"I entered the recess with the utmost caution, and discovered, by your\r\nbreathings, in what condition you were. The unexpected interpretation\r\nwhich you placed upon my former proceeding, suggested my conduct on\r\nthe present occasion. The mode in which heaven is said by the poet, to\r\ninterfere for the prevention of crimes, [**] was somewhat analogous to my\r\nprovince, and never failed to occur to me at seasons like this. It\r\nwas requisite to break your slumbers, and for this end I uttered the\r\npowerful monosyllable, \"hold! hold!\" My purpose was not prescribed by\r\nduty, yet surely it was far from being atrocious and inexpiable. To\r\neffect it, I uttered what was false, but it was well suited to my\r\npurpose. Nothing less was intended than to injure you. Nay, the evil\r\nresulting from my former act, was partly removed by assuring you that in\r\nall places but this you were safe.\r\n\r\n\r\n     * BILOQUIUM, or ventrilocution. Sound is varied according to\r\n     the variations of direction and distance. The art of the\r\n     ventriloquist consists in modifying his voice according to\r\n     all these variations, without changing his place. See the\r\n     work of the Abbe de la Chappelle, in which are accurately\r\n     recorded the performances of one of these artists, and some\r\n     ingenious, though unsatisfactory speculations are given on\r\n     the means by which the effects are produced. This power is,\r\n     perhaps, given by nature, but is doubtless improvable, if\r\n     not acquirable, by art. It may, possibly, consist in an\r\n     unusual flexibility or exertion of the bottom of the tongue\r\n     and the uvula. That speech is producible by these alone must\r\n     be granted, since anatomists mention two instances of\r\n     persons speaking without a tongue. In one case, the organ\r\n     was originally wanting, but its place was supplied by a\r\n     small tubercle, and the uvula was perfect. In the other, the\r\n     tongue was destroyed by disease, but probably a small part\r\n     of it remained.\r\n\r\n     This power is difficult to explain, but the fact is\r\n     undeniable. Experience shews that the human voice can\r\n     imitate the voice of all men and of all inferior animals.\r\n     The sound of musical instruments, and even noises from the\r\n     contact of inanimate substances, have been accurately\r\n     imitated. The mimicry of animals is notorious; and Dr.\r\n     Burney (Musical Travels) mentions one who imitated a flute\r\n     and violin, so as to deceive even his ears.\r\n\r\n\r\n     **--Peeps through the blanket of the dark, and cries Hold!\r\n     Hold!--SHAKESPEARE.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter XXIII\r\n\r\n\r\n\"My morals will appear to you far from rigid, yet my conduct will fall\r\nshort of your suspicions. I am now to confess actions less excusable,\r\nand yet surely they will not entitle me to the name of a desperate or\r\nsordid criminal.\r\n\r\n\"Your house was rendered, by your frequent and long absences, easily\r\naccessible to my curiosity. My meeting with Pleyel was the prelude to\r\ndirect intercourse with you. I had seen much of the world, but your\r\ncharacter exhibited a specimen of human powers that was wholly new to\r\nme. My intercourse with your servant furnished me with curious details\r\nof your domestic management. I was of a different sex: I was not your\r\nhusband; I was not even your friend; yet my knowledge of you was of that\r\nkind, which conjugal intimacies can give, and, in some respects, more\r\naccurate. The observation of your domestic was guided by me.\r\n\r\n\"You will not be surprized that I should sometimes profit by your\r\nabsence, and adventure to examine with my own eyes, the interior of your\r\nchamber. Upright and sincere, you used no watchfulness, and practised\r\nno precautions. I scrutinized every thing, and pried every where. Your\r\ncloset was usually locked, but it was once my fortune to find the key on\r\na bureau. I opened and found new scope for my curiosity in your books.\r\nOne of these was manuscript, and written in characters which essentially\r\nagreed with a short-hand system which I had learned from a Jesuit\r\nmissionary.\r\n\r\n\"I cannot justify my conduct, yet my only crime was curiosity. I\r\nperused this volume with eagerness. The intellect which it unveiled, was\r\nbrighter than my limited and feeble organs could bear. I was naturally\r\ninquisitive as to your ideas respecting my deportment, and the mysteries\r\nthat had lately occurred.\r\n\r\n\"You know what you have written. You know that in this volume the key to\r\nyour inmost soul was contained. If I had been a profound and malignant\r\nimpostor, what plenteous materials were thus furnished me of stratagems\r\nand plots!\r\n\r\n\"The coincidence of your dream in the summer-house with my exclamation,\r\nwas truly wonderful. The voice which warned you to forbear was,\r\ndoubtless, mine; but mixed by a common process of the fancy, with the\r\ntrain of visionary incidents.\r\n\r\n\"I saw in a stronger light than ever, the dangerousness of that\r\ninstrument which I employed, and renewed my resolutions to abstain from\r\nthe use of it in future; but I was destined perpetually to violate my\r\nresolutions. By some perverse fate, I was led into circumstances in\r\nwhich the exertion of my powers was the sole or the best means of\r\nescape.\r\n\r\n\"On that memorable night on which our last interview took place, I\r\ncame as usual to Mettingen. I was apprized of your engagement at your\r\nbrother's, from which you did not expect to return till late. Some\r\nincident suggested the design of visiting your chamber. Among your books\r\nwhich I had not examined, might be something tending to illustrate\r\nyour character, or the history of your family. Some intimation had been\r\ndropped by you in discourse, respecting a performance of your father, in\r\nwhich some important transaction in his life was recorded.\r\n\r\n\"I was desirous of seeing this book; and such was my habitual attachment\r\nto mystery, that I preferred the clandestine perusal of it. Such\r\nwere the motives that induced me to make this attempt. Judith had\r\ndisappeared, and finding the house unoccupied, I supplied myself with a\r\nlight, and proceeded to your chamber.\r\n\r\n\"I found it easy, on experiment, to lock and unlock your closet door\r\nwithout the aid of a key. I shut myself in this recess, and was busily\r\nexploring your shelves, when I heard some one enter the room below. I\r\nwas at a loss who it could be, whether you or your servant. Doubtful,\r\nhowever, as I was, I conceived it prudent to extinguish the light.\r\nScarcely was this done, when some one entered the chamber. The footsteps\r\nwere easily distinguished to be yours.\r\n\r\n\"My situation was now full of danger and perplexity. For some time, I\r\ncherished the hope that you would leave the room so long as to afford\r\nme an opportunity of escaping. As the hours passed, this hope gradually\r\ndeserted me. It was plain that you had retired for the night.\r\n\r\n\"I knew not how soon you might find occasion to enter the closet. I was\r\nalive to all the horrors of detection, and ruminated without ceasing, on\r\nthe behaviour which it would be proper, in case of detection, to adopt.\r\nI was unable to discover any consistent method of accounting for my\r\nbeing thus immured.\r\n\r\n\"It occurred to me that I might withdraw you from your chamber for a few\r\nminutes, by counterfeiting a voice from without. Some message from your\r\nbrother might be delivered, requiring your presence at his house. I was\r\ndeterred from this scheme by reflecting on the resolution I had formed,\r\nand on the possible evils that might result from it. Besides, it was\r\nnot improbable that you would speedily retire to bed, and then, by the\r\nexercise of sufficient caution, I might hope to escape unobserved.\r\n\r\n\"Meanwhile I listened with the deepest anxiety to every motion from\r\nwithout. I discovered nothing which betokened preparation for\r\nsleep. Instead of this I heard deep-drawn sighs, and occasionally an\r\nhalf-expressed and mournful ejaculation. Hence I inferred that you were\r\nunhappy. The true state of your mind with regard to Pleyel your own pen\r\nhad disclosed; but I supposed you to be framed of such materials, that,\r\nthough a momentary sadness might affect you, you were impregnable to any\r\npermanent and heartfelt grief. Inquietude for my own safety was, for a\r\nmoment, suspended by sympathy with your distress.\r\n\r\n\"To the former consideration I was quickly recalled by a motion of yours\r\nwhich indicated I knew not what. I fostered the persuasion that you\r\nwould now retire to bed; but presently you approached the closet, and\r\ndetection seemed to be inevitable. You put your hand upon the lock. I\r\nhad formed no plan to extricate myself from the dilemma in which the\r\nopening of the door would involve me. I felt an irreconcilable aversion\r\nto detection. Thus situated, I involuntarily seized the door with a\r\nresolution to resist your efforts to open it.\r\n\r\n\"Suddenly you receded from the door. This deportment was inexplicable,\r\nbut the relief it afforded me was quickly gone. You returned, and I once\r\nmore was thrown into perplexity. The expedient that suggested itself was\r\nprecipitate and inartificial. I exerted my organs and called upon you TO\r\nHOLD.\r\n\r\n\"That you should persist in spite of this admonition, was a subject of\r\nastonishment. I again resisted your efforts; for the first expedient\r\nhaving failed, I knew not what other to resort to. In this state, how\r\nwas my astonishment increased when I heard your exclamations!\r\n\r\n\"It was now plain that you knew me to be within. Further resistance was\r\nunavailing and useless. The door opened, and I shrunk backward. Seldom\r\nhave I felt deeper mortification, and more painful perplexity. I did\r\nnot consider that the truth would be less injurious than any lie which I\r\ncould hastily frame. Conscious as I was of a certain degree of guilt,\r\nI conceived that you would form the most odious suspicions. The truth\r\nwould be imperfect, unless I were likewise to explain the mysterious\r\nadmonition which had been given; but that explanation was of too great\r\nmoment, and involved too extensive consequences to make me suddenly\r\nresolve to give it. I was aware that this discovery would associate\r\nitself in your mind, with the dialogue formerly heard in this closet.\r\nThence would your suspicions be aggravated, and to escape from these\r\nsuspicions would be impossible. But the mere truth would be sufficiently\r\nopprobrious, and deprive me for ever of your good opinion.\r\n\r\n\"Thus was I rendered desperate, and my mind rapidly passed to the\r\ncontemplation of the use that might be made of previous events. Some\r\ngood genius would appear to you to have interposed to save you from\r\ninjury intended by me. Why, I said, since I must sink in her opinion,\r\nshould I not cherish this belief? Why not personate an enemy, and\r\npretend that celestial interference has frustrated my schemes? I must\r\nfly, but let me leave wonder and fear behind me. Elucidation of the\r\nmystery will always be practicable. I shall do no injury, but merely\r\ntalk of evil that was designed, but is now past.\r\n\r\n\"Thus I extenuated my conduct to myself, but I scarcely expect that\r\nthis will be to you a sufficient explication of the scene that followed.\r\nThose habits which I have imbibed, the rooted passion which possesses me\r\nfor scattering around me amazement and fear, you enjoy no opportunities\r\nof knowing. That a man should wantonly impute to himself the most\r\nflagitious designs, will hardly be credited, even though you reflect\r\nthat my reputation was already, by my own folly, irretrievably ruined;\r\nand that it was always in my power to communicate the truth, and rectify\r\nthe mistake.\r\n\r\n\"I left you to ponder on this scene. My mind was full of rapid\r\nand incongruous ideas. Compunction, self-upbraiding, hopelesness,\r\nsatisfaction at the view of those effects likely to flow from my new\r\nscheme, misgivings as to the beneficial result of this scheme took\r\npossession of my mind, and seemed to struggle for the mastery.\r\n\r\n\"I had gone too far to recede. I had painted myself to you as an\r\nassassin and ravisher, withheld from guilt only by a voice from heaven.\r\nI had thus reverted into the path of error, and now, having gone thus\r\nfar, my progress seemed to be irrevocable. I said to myself, I must\r\nleave these precincts for ever. My acts have blasted my fame in the eyes\r\nof the Wielands. For the sake of creating a mysterious dread, I have\r\nmade myself a villain. I may complete this mysterious plan by some new\r\nimposture, but I cannot aggravate my supposed guilt.\r\n\r\n\"My resolution was formed, and I was swiftly ruminating on the means for\r\nexecuting it, when Pleyel appeared in sight. This incident decided my\r\nconduct. It was plain that Pleyel was a devoted lover, but he was, at\r\nthe same time, a man of cold resolves and exquisite sagacity. To deceive\r\nhim would be the sweetest triumph I had ever enjoyed. The deception\r\nwould be momentary, but it would likewise be complete. That his delusion\r\nwould so soon be rectified, was a recommendation to my scheme, for I\r\nesteemed him too much to desire to entail upon him lasting agonies.\r\n\r\n\"I had no time to reflect further, for he proceeded, with a quick\r\nstep, towards the house. I was hurried onward involuntarily and by a\r\nmechanical impulse. I followed him as he passed the recess in the bank,\r\nand shrowding myself in that spot, I counterfeited sounds which I knew\r\nwould arrest his steps.\r\n\r\n\"He stopped, turned, listened, approached, and overheard a dialogue\r\nwhose purpose was to vanquish his belief in a point where his belief\r\nwas most difficult to vanquish. I exerted all my powers to imitate your\r\nvoice, your general sentiments, and your language. Being master,\r\nby means of your journal, of your personal history and most secret\r\nthoughts, my efforts were the more successful. When I reviewed the tenor\r\nof this dialogue, I cannot believe but that Pleyel was deluded. When I\r\nthink of your character, and of the inferences which this dialogue was\r\nintended to suggest, it seems incredible that this delusion should be\r\nproduced.\r\n\r\n\"I spared not myself. I called myself murderer, thief, guilty of\r\ninnumerable perjuries and misdeeds: that you had debased yourself to the\r\nlevel of such an one, no evidence, methought, would suffice to convince\r\nhim who knew you so thoroughly as Pleyel; and yet the imposture\r\namounted to proof which the most jealous scrutiny would find to be\r\nunexceptionable.\r\n\r\n\"He left his station precipitately and resumed his way to the house. I\r\nsaw that the detection of his error would be instantaneous, since, not\r\nhaving gone to bed, an immediate interview would take place between\r\nyou. At first this circumstance was considered with regret; but as time\r\nopened my eyes to the possible consequences of this scene, I regarded it\r\nwith pleasure.\r\n\r\n\"In a short time the infatuation which had led me thus far began to\r\nsubside. The remembrance of former reasonings and transactions was\r\nrenewed. How often I had repented this kind of exertion; how many evils\r\nwere produced by it which I had not foreseen; what occasions for the\r\nbitterest remorse it had administered, now passed through my mind. The\r\nblack catalogue of stratagems was now increased. I had inspired you with\r\nthe most vehement terrors: I had filled your mind with faith in shadows\r\nand confidence in dreams: I had depraved the imagination of Pleyel:\r\nI had exhibited you to his understanding as devoted to brutal\r\ngratifications and consummate in hypocrisy. The evidence which\r\naccompanied this delusion would be irresistible to one whose passion\r\nhad perverted his judgment, whose jealousy with regard to me had already\r\nbeen excited, and who, therefore, would not fail to overrate the force\r\nof this evidence. What fatal act of despair or of vengeance might not\r\nthis error produce?\r\n\r\n\"With regard to myself, I had acted with a phrenzy that surpassed\r\nbelief. I had warred against my peace and my fame: I had banished myself\r\nfrom the fellowship of vigorous and pure minds: I was self-expelled\r\nfrom a scene which the munificence of nature had adorned with unrivalled\r\nbeauties, and from haunts in which all the muses and humanities had\r\ntaken refuge.\r\n\r\n\"I was thus torn by conflicting fears and tumultuous regrets. The night\r\npassed away in this state of confusion; and next morning in the gazette\r\nleft at my obscure lodging, I read a description and an offer of reward\r\nfor the apprehension of my person. I was said to have escaped from\r\nan Irish prison, in which I was confined as an offender convicted of\r\nenormous and complicated crimes.\r\n\r\n\"This was the work of an enemy, who, by falsehood and stratagem, had\r\nprocured my condemnation. I was, indeed, a prisoner, but escaped, by the\r\nexertion of my powers, the fate to which I was doomed, but which I did\r\nnot deserve. I had hoped that the malice of my foe was exhausted; but\r\nI now perceived that my precautions had been wise, for that the\r\nintervention of an ocean was insufficient for my security.\r\n\r\n\"Let me not dwell on the sensations which this discovery produced. I\r\nneed not tell by what steps I was induced to seek an interview with\r\nyou, for the purpose of disclosing the truth, and repairing, as far as\r\npossible, the effects of my misconduct. It was unavoidable that this\r\ngazette would fall into your hands, and that it would tend to confirm\r\nevery erroneous impression.\r\n\r\n\"Having gained this interview, I purposed to seek some retreat in the\r\nwilderness, inaccessible to your inquiry and to the malice of my foe,\r\nwhere I might henceforth employ myself in composing a faithful narrative\r\nof my actions. I designed it as my vindication from the aspersions that\r\nhad rested on my character, and as a lesson to mankind on the evils of\r\ncredulity on the one hand, and of imposture on the other.\r\n\r\n\"I wrote you a billet, which was left at the house of your friend,\r\nand which I knew would, by some means, speedily come to your hands. I\r\nentertained a faint hope that my invitation would be complied with. I\r\nknew not what use you would make of the opportunity which this proposal\r\nafforded you of procuring the seizure of my person; but this fate I was\r\ndetermined to avoid, and I had no doubt but due circumspection, and the\r\nexercise of the faculty which I possessed, would enable me to avoid it.\r\n\r\n\"I lurked, through the day, in the neighbourhood of Mettingen: I\r\napproached your habitation at the appointed hour: I entered it in\r\nsilence, by a trap-door which led into the cellar. This had formerly\r\nbeen bolted on the inside, but Judith had, at an early period in our\r\nintercourse, removed this impediment. I ascended to the first floor, but\r\nmet with no one, nor any thing that indicated the presence of an human\r\nbeing.\r\n\r\n\"I crept softly up stairs, and at length perceived your chamber door\r\nto be opened, and a light to be within. It was of moment to discover by\r\nwhom this light was accompanied. I was sensible of the inconveniencies\r\nto which my being discovered at your chamber door by any one within\r\nwould subject me; I therefore called out in my own voice, but so\r\nmodified that it should appear to ascend from the court below, 'Who is\r\nin the chamber? Is it Miss Wieland?\"\r\n\r\n\"No answer was returned to this summons. I listened, but no motion could\r\nbe heard. After a pause I repeated my call, but no less ineffectually.\r\n\r\n\"I now approached nearer the door, and adventured to look in. A light\r\nstood on the table, but nothing human was discernible. I entered\r\ncautiously, but all was solitude and stillness.\r\n\r\n\"I knew not what to conclude. If the house were inhabited, my call would\r\nhave been noticed; yet some suspicion insinuated itself that silence was\r\nstudiously kept by persons who intended to surprize me. My approach had\r\nbeen wary, and the silence that ensued my call had likewise preceded it;\r\na circumstance that tended to dissipate my fears.\r\n\r\n\"At length it occurred to me that Judith might possibly be in her own\r\nroom. I turned my steps thither; but she was not to be found. I passed\r\ninto other rooms, and was soon convinced that the house was totally\r\ndeserted. I returned to your chamber, agitated by vain surmises and\r\nopposite conjectures. The appointed hour had passed, and I dismissed the\r\nhope of an interview.\r\n\r\n\"In this state of things I determined to leave a few lines on your\r\ntoilet, and prosecute my journey to the mountains. Scarcely had I taken\r\nthe pen when I laid it aside, uncertain in what manner to address you.\r\nI rose from the table and walked across the floor. A glance thrown upon\r\nthe bed acquainted me with a spectacle to which my conceptions of horror\r\nhad not yet reached.\r\n\r\n\"In the midst of shuddering and trepidation, the signal of your presence\r\nin the court below recalled me to myself. The deed was newly done:\r\nI only was in the house: what had lately happened justified any\r\nsuspicions, however enormous. It was plain that this catastrophe was\r\nunknown to you: I thought upon the wild commotion which the discovery\r\nwould awaken in your breast: I found the confusion of my own thoughts\r\nunconquerable, and perceived that the end for which I sought an\r\ninterview was not now to be accomplished.\r\n\r\n\"In this state of things it was likewise expedient to conceal my being\r\nwithin. I put out the light and hurried down stairs. To my unspeakable\r\nsurprize, notwithstanding every motive to fear, you lighted a candle and\r\nproceeded to your chamber.\r\n\r\n\"I retired to that room below from which a door leads into the cellar.\r\nThis door concealed me from your view as you passed. I thought upon the\r\nspectacle which was about to present itself. In an exigence so\r\nabrupt and so little foreseen, I was again subjected to the empire\r\nof mechanical and habitual impulses. I dreaded the effects which this\r\nshocking exhibition, bursting on your unprepared senses, might produce.\r\n\r\n\"Thus actuated, I stept swiftly to the door, and thrusting my head\r\nforward, once more pronounced the mysterious interdiction. At that\r\nmoment, by some untoward fate, your eyes were cast back, and you saw\r\nme in the very act of utterance. I fled through the darksome avenue at\r\nwhich I entered, covered with the shame of this detection.\r\n\r\n\"With diligence, stimulated by a thousand ineffable emotions, I pursued\r\nmy intended journey. I have a brother whose farm is situated in the\r\nbosom of a fertile desert, near the sources of the Leheigh, and thither\r\nI now repaired.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter XXIV\r\n\r\n\r\n\"Deeply did I ruminate on the occurrences that had just passed. Nothing\r\nexcited my wonder so much as the means by which you discovered my being\r\nin the closet. This discovery appeared to be made at the moment when you\r\nattempted to open it. How could you have otherwise remained so long in\r\nthe chamber apparently fearless and tranquil? And yet, having made\r\nthis discovery, how could you persist in dragging me forth: persist in\r\ndefiance of an interdiction so emphatical and solemn?\r\n\r\n\"But your sister's death was an event detestable and ominous. She had\r\nbeen the victim of the most dreadful species of assassination. How, in a\r\nstate like yours, the murderous intention could be generated, was wholly\r\ninconceivable.\r\n\r\n\"I did not relinquish my design of confessing to you the part which I\r\nhad sustained in your family, but I was willing to defer it till the\r\ntask which I had set myself was finished. That being done, I resumed the\r\nresolution. The motives to incite me to this continually acquired\r\nforce. The more I revolved the events happening at Mettingen, the more\r\ninsupportable and ominous my terrors became. My waking hours and my\r\nsleep were vexed by dismal presages and frightful intimations.\r\n\r\n\"Catharine was dead by violence. Surely my malignant stars had not made\r\nme the cause of her death; yet had I not rashly set in motion a machine,\r\nover whose progress I had no controul, and which experience had shewn me\r\nwas infinite in power? Every day might add to the catalogue of horrors\r\nof which this was the source, and a seasonable disclosure of the truth\r\nmight prevent numberless ills.\r\n\r\n\"Fraught with this conception, I have turned my steps hither. I find\r\nyour brother's house desolate: the furniture removed, and the walls\r\nstained with damps. Your own is in the same situation. Your chamber is\r\ndismantled and dark, and you exhibit an image of incurable grief, and of\r\nrapid decay.\r\n\r\n\"I have uttered the truth. This is the extent of my offences. You tell\r\nme an horrid tale of Wieland being led to the destruction of his wife\r\nand children, by some mysterious agent. You charge me with the guilt\r\nof this agency; but I repeat that the amount of my guilt has been truly\r\nstated. The perpetrator of Catharine's death was unknown to me till now;\r\nnay, it is still unknown to me.\"\r\n\r\nAt that moment, the closing of a door in the kitchen was distinctly\r\nheard by us. Carwin started and paused. \"There is some one coming. I\r\nmust not be found here by my enemies, and need not, since my purpose is\r\nanswered.\"\r\n\r\nI had drunk in, with the most vehement attention, every word that he\r\nhad uttered. I had no breath to interrupt his tale by interrogations\r\nor comments. The power that he spoke of was hitherto unknown to me: its\r\nexistence was incredible; it was susceptible of no direct proof.\r\n\r\nHe owns that his were the voice and face which I heard and saw. He\r\nattempts to give an human explanation of these phantasms; but it is\r\nenough that he owns himself to be the agent; his tale is a lie, and his\r\nnature devilish. As he deceived me, he likewise deceived my brother, and\r\nnow do I behold the author of all our calamities!\r\n\r\nSuch were my thoughts when his pause allowed me to think. I should have\r\nbad him begone if the silence had not been interrupted; but now I feared\r\nno more for myself; and the milkiness of my nature was curdled into\r\nhatred and rancour. Some one was near, and this enemy of God and\r\nman might possibly be brought to justice. I reflected not that the\r\npreternatural power which he had hitherto exerted, would avail to rescue\r\nhim from any toils in which his feet might be entangled. Meanwhile,\r\nlooks, and not words of menace and abhorrence, were all that I could\r\nbestow.\r\n\r\nHe did not depart. He seemed dubious, whether, by passing out of the\r\nhouse, or by remaining somewhat longer where he was, he should most\r\nendanger his safety. His confusion increased when steps of one barefoot\r\nwere heard upon the stairs. He threw anxious glances sometimes at the\r\ncloset, sometimes at the window, and sometimes at the chamber door, yet\r\nhe was detained by some inexplicable fascination. He stood as if rooted\r\nto the spot.\r\n\r\nAs to me, my soul was bursting with detestation and revenge. I had\r\nno room for surmises and fears respecting him that approached. It was\r\ndoubtless a human being, and would befriend me so far as to aid me in\r\narresting this offender.\r\n\r\nThe stranger quickly entered the room. My eyes and the eyes of Carwin\r\nwere, at the same moment, darted upon him. A second glance was not\r\nneeded to inform us who he was. His locks were tangled, and fell\r\nconfusedly over his forehead and ears. His shirt was of coarse stuff,\r\nand open at the neck and breast. His coat was once of bright and fine\r\ntexture, but now torn and tarnished with dust. His feet, his legs, and\r\nhis arms were bare. His features were the seat of a wild and tranquil\r\nsolemnity, but his eyes bespoke inquietude and curiosity.\r\n\r\nHe advanced with firm step, and looking as in search of some one. He saw\r\nme and stopped. He bent his sight on the floor, and clenching his hands,\r\nappeared suddenly absorbed in meditation. Such were the figure and\r\ndeportment of Wieland! Such, in his fallen state, were the aspect and\r\nguise of my brother!\r\n\r\nCarwin did not fail to recognize the visitant. Care for his own safety\r\nwas apparently swallowed up in the amazement which this spectacle\r\nproduced. His station was conspicuous, and he could not have escaped the\r\nroving glances of Wieland; yet the latter seemed totally unconscious of\r\nhis presence.\r\n\r\nGrief at this scene of ruin and blast was at first the only sentiment\r\nof which I was conscious. A fearful stillness ensued. At length Wieland,\r\nlifting his hands, which were locked in each other, to his breast,\r\nexclaimed, \"Father! I thank thee. This is thy guidance. Hither thou hast\r\nled me, that I might perform thy will: yet let me not err: let me hear\r\nagain thy messenger!\"\r\n\r\nHe stood for a minute as if listening; but recovering from his attitude,\r\nhe continued--\"It is not needed. Dastardly wretch! thus eternally\r\nquestioning the behests of thy Maker! weak in resolution! wayward in\r\nfaith!\"\r\n\r\nHe advanced to me, and, after another pause, resumed: \"Poor girl!\r\na dismal fate has set its mark upon thee. Thy life is demanded as\r\na sacrifice. Prepare thee to die. Make not my office difficult by\r\nfruitless opposition. Thy prayers might subdue stones; but none but he\r\nwho enjoined my purpose can shake it.\"\r\n\r\nThese words were a sufficient explication of the scene. The nature of\r\nhis phrenzy, as described by my uncle, was remembered. I who had sought\r\ndeath, was now thrilled with horror because it was near. Death in\r\nthis form, death from the hand of a brother, was thought upon with\r\nundescribable repugnance.\r\n\r\nIn a state thus verging upon madness, my eye glanced upon Carwin. His\r\nastonishment appeared to have struck him motionless and dumb. My life\r\nwas in danger, and my brother's hand was about to be embrued in my\r\nblood. I firmly believed that Carwin's was the instigation. I could\r\nrescue me from this abhorred fate; I could dissipate this tremendous\r\nillusion; I could save my brother from the perpetration of new horrors,\r\nby pointing out the devil who seduced him; to hesitate a moment was\r\nto perish. These thoughts gave strength to my limbs, and energy to my\r\naccents: I started on my feet. \"O brother! spare me, spare thyself:\r\nThere is thy betrayer. He counterfeited the voice and face of an angel,\r\nfor the purpose of destroying thee and me. He has this moment confessed\r\nit. He is able to speak where he is not. He is leagued with hell, but\r\nwill not avow it; yet he confesses that the agency was his.\"\r\n\r\nMy brother turned slowly his eyes, and fixed them upon Carwin. Every\r\njoint in the frame of the latter trembled. His complexion was paler than\r\na ghost's. His eye dared not meet that of Wieland, but wandered with an\r\nair of distraction from one space to another.\r\n\r\n\"Man,\" said my brother, in a voice totally unlike that which he had\r\nused to me, \"what art thou? The charge has been made. Answer it.\r\nThe visage--the voice--at the bottom of these stairs--at the hour of\r\neleven--To whom did they belong? To thee?\"\r\n\r\nTwice did Carwin attempt to speak, but his words died away upon his\r\nlips. My brother resumed in a tone of greater vehemence--\r\n\r\n\"Thou falterest; faltering is ominous; say yes or no: one word will\r\nsuffice; but beware of falsehood. Was it a stratagem of hell to\r\noverthrow my family? Wast thou the agent?\"\r\n\r\nI now saw that the wrath which had been prepared for me was to be\r\nheaped upon another. The tale that I heard from him, and his present\r\ntrepidations, were abundant testimonies of his guilt. But what if\r\nWieland should be undeceived! What if he shall find his acts to have\r\nproceeded not from an heavenly prompter, but from human treachery! Will\r\nnot his rage mount into whirlwind? Will not he tare limb from limb this\r\ndevoted wretch?\r\n\r\nInstinctively I recoiled from this image, but it gave place to another.\r\nCarwin may be innocent, but the impetuosity of his judge may misconstrue\r\nhis answers into a confession of guilt. Wieland knows not that\r\nmysterious voices and appearances were likewise witnessed by me. Carwin\r\nmay be ignorant of those which misled my brother. Thus may his answers\r\nunwarily betray himself to ruin.\r\n\r\nSuch might be the consequences of my frantic precipitation, and these,\r\nit was necessary, if possible, to prevent. I attempted to speak, but\r\nWieland, turning suddenly upon me, commanded silence, in a tone furious\r\nand terrible. My lips closed, and my tongue refused its office.\r\n\r\n\"What art thou?\" he resumed, addressing himself to Carwin. \"Answer me;\r\nwhose form--whose voice--was it thy contrivance? Answer me.\"\r\n\r\nThe answer was now given, but confusedly and scarcely articulated. \"I\r\nmeant nothing--I intended no ill--if I understand--if I do not mistake\r\nyou--it is too true--I did appear--in the entry--did speak. The\r\ncontrivance was mine, but--\"\r\n\r\nThese words were no sooner uttered, than my brother ceased to wear the\r\nsame aspect. His eyes were downcast: he was motionless: his respiration\r\nbecame hoarse, like that of a man in the agonies of death. Carwin seemed\r\nunable to say more. He might have easily escaped, but the thought which\r\noccupied him related to what was horrid and unintelligible in this\r\nscene, and not to his own danger.\r\n\r\nPresently the faculties of Wieland, which, for a time, were chained\r\nup, were seized with restlessness and trembling. He broke silence. The\r\nstoutest heart would have been appalled by the tone in which he spoke.\r\nHe addressed himself to Carwin.\r\n\r\n\"Why art thou here? Who detains thee? Go and learn better. I will meet\r\nthee, but it must be at the bar of thy Maker. There shall I bear witness\r\nagainst thee.\"\r\n\r\nPerceiving that Carwin did not obey, he continued; \"Dost thou wish me\r\nto complete the catalogue by thy death? Thy life is a worthless thing.\r\nTempt me no more. I am but a man, and thy presence may awaken a fury\r\nwhich may spurn my controul. Begone!\"\r\n\r\nCarwin, irresolute, striving in vain for utterance, his complexion\r\npallid as death, his knees beating one against another, slowly obeyed\r\nthe mandate and withdrew.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter XXV\r\n\r\n\r\nA few words more and I lay aside the pen for ever. Yet why should I not\r\nrelinquish it now? All that I have said is preparatory to this scene,\r\nand my fingers, tremulous and cold as my heart, refuse any further\r\nexertion. This must not be. Let my last energies support me in the\r\nfinishing of this task. Then will I lay down my head in the lap of\r\ndeath. Hushed will be all my murmurs in the sleep of the grave.\r\n\r\nEvery sentiment has perished in my bosom. Even friendship is extinct.\r\nYour love for me has prompted me to this task; but I would not have\r\ncomplied if it had not been a luxury thus to feast upon my woes. I have\r\njustly calculated upon my remnant of strength. When I lay down the pen\r\nthe taper of life will expire: my existence will terminate with my tale.\r\n\r\nNow that I was left alone with Wieland, the perils of my situation\r\npresented themselves to my mind. That this paroxysm should terminate in\r\nhavock and rage it was reasonable to predict. The first suggestion of my\r\nfears had been disproved by my experience. Carwin had acknowledged his\r\noffences, and yet had escaped. The vengeance which I had harboured had\r\nnot been admitted by Wieland, and yet the evils which I had endured,\r\ncompared with those inflicted on my brother, were as nothing. I thirsted\r\nfor his blood, and was tormented with an insatiable appetite for his\r\ndestruction; yet my brother was unmoved, and had dismissed him in\r\nsafety. Surely thou wast more than man, while I am sunk below the\r\nbeasts.\r\n\r\nDid I place a right construction on the conduct of Wieland? Was the\r\nerror that misled him so easily rectified? Were views so vivid and faith\r\nso strenuous thus liable to fading and to change? Was there not reason\r\nto doubt the accuracy of my perceptions? With images like these was\r\nmy mind thronged, till the deportment of my brother called away my\r\nattention.\r\n\r\nI saw his lips move and his eyes cast up to heaven. Then would he listen\r\nand look back, as if in expectation of some one's appearance. Thrice he\r\nrepeated these gesticulations and this inaudible prayer. Each time the\r\nmist of confusion and doubt seemed to grow darker and to settle on his\r\nunderstanding. I guessed at the meaning of these tokens. The words\r\nof Carwin had shaken his belief, and he was employed in summoning the\r\nmessenger who had formerly communed with him, to attest the value of\r\nthose new doubts. In vain the summons was repeated, for his eye met\r\nnothing but vacancy, and not a sound saluted his ear.\r\n\r\nHe walked to the bed, gazed with eagerness at the pillow which had\r\nsustained the head of the breathless Catharine, and then returned to\r\nthe place where I sat. I had no power to lift my eyes to his face: I was\r\ndubious of his purpose: this purpose might aim at my life.\r\n\r\nAlas! nothing but subjection to danger, and exposure to temptation,\r\ncan show us what we are. By this test was I now tried, and found to be\r\ncowardly and rash. Men can deliberately untie the thread of life, and of\r\nthis I had deemed myself capable; yet now that I stood upon the brink\r\nof fate, that the knife of the sacrificer was aimed at my heart, I\r\nshuddered and betook myself to any means of escape, however monstrous.\r\n\r\nCan I bear to think--can I endure to relate the outrage which my heart\r\nmeditated? Where were my means of safety? Resistance was vain. Not even\r\nthe energy of despair could set me on a level with that strength which\r\nhis terrific prompter had bestowed upon Wieland. Terror enables us to\r\nperform incredible feats; but terror was not then the state of my mind:\r\nwhere then were my hopes of rescue?\r\n\r\nMethinks it is too much. I stand aside, as it were, from myself; I\r\nestimate my own deservings; a hatred, immortal and inexorable, is my\r\ndue. I listen to my own pleas, and find them empty and false: yes, I\r\nacknowledge that my guilt surpasses that of all mankind: I confess that\r\nthe curses of a world, and the frowns of a deity, are inadequate to my\r\ndemerits. Is there a thing in the world worthy of infinite abhorrence?\r\nIt is I. What shall I say! I was menaced, as I thought, with death, and,\r\nto elude this evil, my hand was ready to inflict death upon the menacer.\r\nIn visiting my house, I had made provision against the machinations of\r\nCarwin. In a fold of my dress an open penknife was concealed. This I\r\nnow seized and drew forth. It lurked out of view: but I now see that my\r\nstate of mind would have rendered the deed inevitable if my brother\r\nhad lifted his hand. This instrument of my preservation would have been\r\nplunged into his heart.\r\n\r\nO, insupportable remembrance! hide thee from my view for a time; hide\r\nit from me that my heart was black enough to meditate the stabbing of a\r\nbrother! a brother thus supreme in misery; thus towering in virtue!\r\n\r\nHe was probably unconscious of my design, but presently drew back.\r\nThis interval was sufficient to restore me to myself. The madness, the\r\niniquity of that act which I had purposed rushed upon my apprehension.\r\nFor a moment I was breathless with agony. At the next moment I recovered\r\nmy strength, and threw the knife with violence on the floor.\r\n\r\nThe sound awoke my brother from his reverie. He gazed alternately at me\r\nand at the weapon. With a movement equally solemn he stooped and took\r\nit up. He placed the blade in different positions, scrutinizing it\r\naccurately, and maintaining, at the same time, a profound silence.\r\n\r\nAgain he looked at me, but all that vehemence and loftiness of spirit\r\nwhich had so lately characterized his features, were flown. Fallen\r\nmuscles, a forehead contracted into folds, eyes dim with unbidden\r\ndrops, and a ruefulness of aspect which no words can describe, were now\r\nvisible.\r\n\r\nHis looks touched into energy the same sympathies in me, and I poured\r\nforth a flood of tears. This passion was quickly checked by fear, which\r\nhad now, no longer, my own, but his safety for their object. I watched\r\nhis deportment in silence. At length he spoke:\r\n\r\n\"Sister,\" said he, in an accent mournful and mild, \"I have acted poorly\r\nmy part in this world. What thinkest thou? Shall I not do better in the\r\nnext?\"\r\n\r\nI could make no answer. The mildness of his tone astonished and\r\nencouraged me. I continued to regard him with wistful and anxious looks.\r\n\r\n\"I think,\" resumed he, \"I will try. My wife and my babes have gone\r\nbefore. Happy wretches! I have sent you to repose, and ought not to\r\nlinger behind.\"\r\n\r\nThese words had a meaning sufficiently intelligible. I looked at the\r\nopen knife in his hand and shuddered, but knew not how to prevent the\r\ndeed which I dreaded. He quickly noticed my fears, and comprehended\r\nthem. Stretching towards me his hand, with an air of increasing\r\nmildness: \"Take it,\" said he: \"Fear not for thy own sake, nor for mine.\r\nThe cup is gone by, and its transient inebriation is succeeded by the\r\nsoberness of truth.\r\n\r\n\"Thou angel whom I was wont to worship! fearest thou, my sister, for\r\nthy life? Once it was the scope of my labours to destroy thee, but I was\r\nprompted to the deed by heaven; such, at least, was my belief. Thinkest\r\nthou that thy death was sought to gratify malevolence? No. I am pure\r\nfrom all stain. I believed that my God was my mover!\r\n\r\n\"Neither thee nor myself have I cause to injure. I have done my duty,\r\nand surely there is merit in having sacrificed to that, all that is dear\r\nto the heart of man. If a devil has deceived me, he came in the habit\r\nof an angel. If I erred, it was not my judgment that deceived me, but\r\nmy senses. In thy sight, being of beings! I am still pure. Still will I\r\nlook for my reward in thy justice!\"\r\n\r\nDid my ears truly report these sounds? If I did not err, my brother was\r\nrestored to just perceptions. He knew himself to have been betrayed to\r\nthe murder of his wife and children, to have been the victim of infernal\r\nartifice; yet he found consolation in the rectitude of his motives. He\r\nwas not devoid of sorrow, for this was written on his countenance; but\r\nhis soul was tranquil and sublime.\r\n\r\nPerhaps this was merely a transition of his former madness into a new\r\nshape. Perhaps he had not yet awakened to the memory of the horrors\r\nwhich he had perpetrated. Infatuated wretch that I was! To set myself up\r\nas a model by which to judge of my heroic brother! My reason taught\r\nme that his conclusions were right; but conscious of the impotence of\r\nreason over my own conduct; conscious of my cowardly rashness and my\r\ncriminal despair, I doubted whether any one could be stedfast and wise.\r\n\r\nSuch was my weakness, that even in the midst of these thoughts, my\r\nmind glided into abhorrence of Carwin, and I uttered in a low voice, O!\r\nCarwin! Carwin! What hast thou to answer for?\r\n\r\nMy brother immediately noticed the involuntary exclamation: \"Clara!\"\r\nsaid he, \"be thyself. Equity used to be a theme for thy eloquence.\r\nReduce its lessons to practice, and be just to that unfortunate man. The\r\ninstrument has done its work, and I am satisfied.\r\n\r\n\"I thank thee, my God, for this last illumination! My enemy is thine\r\nalso. I deemed him to be man, the man with whom I have often communed;\r\nbut now thy goodness has unveiled to me his true nature. As the\r\nperformer of thy behests, he is my friend.\"\r\n\r\nMy heart began now to misgive me. His mournful aspect had gradually\r\nyielded place to a serene brow. A new soul appeared to actuate his\r\nframe, and his eyes to beam with preternatural lustre. These symptoms\r\ndid not abate, and he continued:\r\n\r\n\"Clara! I must not leave thee in doubt. I know not what brought about\r\nthy interview with the being whom thou callest Carwin. For a time, I was\r\nguilty of thy error, and deduced from his incoherent confessions that I\r\nhad been made the victim of human malice. He left us at my bidding, and\r\nI put up a prayer that my doubts should be removed. Thy eyes were shut,\r\nand thy ears sealed to the vision that answered my prayer.\r\n\r\n\"I was indeed deceived. The form thou hast seen was the incarnation of\r\na daemon. The visage and voice which urged me to the sacrifice of my\r\nfamily, were his. Now he personates a human form: then he was invironed\r\nwith the lustre of heaven.--\r\n\r\n\"Clara,\" he continued, advancing closer to me, \"thy death must come.\r\nThis minister is evil, but he from whom his commission was received is\r\nGod. Submit then with all thy wonted resignation to a decree that cannot\r\nbe reversed or resisted. Mark the clock. Three minutes are allowed to\r\nthee, in which to call up thy fortitude, and prepare thee for thy doom.\"\r\nThere he stopped.\r\n\r\nEven now, when this scene exists only in memory, when life and all its\r\nfunctions have sunk into torpor, my pulse throbs, and my hairs uprise:\r\nmy brows are knit, as then; and I gaze around me in distraction. I was\r\nunconquerably averse to death; but death, imminent and full of agony as\r\nthat which was threatened, was nothing. This was not the only or chief\r\ninspirer of my fears.\r\n\r\nFor him, not for myself, was my soul tormented. I might die, and no\r\ncrime, surpassing the reach of mercy, would pursue me to the presence\r\nof my Judge; but my assassin would survive to contemplate his deed, and\r\nthat assassin was Wieland!\r\n\r\nWings to bear me beyond his reach I had not. I could not vanish with a\r\nthought. The door was open, but my murderer was interposed between\r\nthat and me. Of self-defence I was incapable. The phrenzy that lately\r\nprompted me to blood was gone; my state was desperate; my rescue was\r\nimpossible.\r\n\r\nThe weight of these accumulated thoughts could not be borne. My sight\r\nbecame confused; my limbs were seized with convulsion; I spoke, but my\r\nwords were half-formed:--\r\n\r\n\"Spare me, my brother! Look down, righteous Judge! snatch me from this\r\nfate! take away this fury from him, or turn it elsewhere!\"\r\n\r\nSuch was the agony of my thoughts, that I noticed not steps entering my\r\napartment. Supplicating eyes were cast upward, but when my prayer was\r\nbreathed, I once more wildly gazed at the door. A form met my sight: I\r\nshuddered as if the God whom I invoked were present. It was Carwin that\r\nagain intruded, and who stood before me, erect in attitude, and stedfast\r\nin look! The sight of him awakened new and rapid thoughts. His recent\r\ntale was remembered: his magical transitions and mysterious energy of\r\nvoice: Whether he were infernal or miraculous, or human, there was no\r\npower and no need to decide. Whether the contriver or not of this spell,\r\nhe was able to unbind it, and to check the fury of my brother. He had\r\nascribed to himself intentions not malignant. Here now was afforded a\r\ntest of his truth. Let him interpose, as from above; revoke the\r\nsavage decree which the madness of Wieland has assigned to heaven, and\r\nextinguish for ever this passion for blood!\r\n\r\nMy mind detected at a glance this avenue to safety. The recommendations\r\nit possessed thronged as it were together, and made but one impression\r\non my intellect. Remoter effects and collateral dangers I saw not.\r\nPerhaps the pause of an instant had sufficed to call them up. The\r\nimprobability that the influence which governed Wieland was external or\r\nhuman; the tendency of this stratagem to sanction so fatal an error, or\r\nsubstitute a more destructive rage in place of this; the sufficiency of\r\nCarwin's mere muscular forces to counteract the efforts, and restrain\r\nthe fury of Wieland, might, at a second glance, have been discovered;\r\nbut no second glance was allowed. My first thought hurried me to action,\r\nand, fixing my eyes upon Carwin I exclaimed--\r\n\r\n\"O wretch! once more hast thou come? Let it be to abjure thy malice; to\r\ncounterwork this hellish stratagem; to turn from me and from my brother,\r\nthis desolating rage!\r\n\r\n\"Testify thy innocence or thy remorse: exert the powers which pertain to\r\nthee, whatever they be, to turn aside this ruin. Thou art the author\r\nof these horrors! What have I done to deserve thus to die? How have I\r\nmerited this unrelenting persecution? I adjure thee, by that God whose\r\nvoice thou hast dared to counterfeit, to save my life!\r\n\r\n\"Wilt thou then go? leave me! Succourless!\"\r\n\r\nCarwin listened to my intreaties unmoved, and turned from me. He seemed\r\nto hesitate a moment: then glided through the door. Rage and despair\r\nstifled my utterance. The interval of respite was passed; the pangs\r\nreserved for me by Wieland, were not to be endured; my thoughts rushed\r\nagain into anarchy. Having received the knife from his hand, I held it\r\nloosely and without regard; but now it seized again my attention, and I\r\ngrasped it with force.\r\n\r\nHe seemed to notice not the entrance or exit of Carwin. My gesture and\r\nthe murderous weapon appeared to have escaped his notice. His silence\r\nwas unbroken; his eye, fixed upon the clock for a time, was now\r\nwithdrawn; fury kindled in every feature; all that was human in his face\r\ngave way to an expression supernatural and tremendous. I felt my left\r\narm within his grasp.--\r\n\r\nEven now I hesitated to strike. I shrunk from his assault, but in\r\nvain.--\r\n\r\nHere let me desist. Why should I rescue this event from oblivion? Why\r\nshould I paint this detestable conflict? Why not terminate at once this\r\nseries of horrors?--Hurry to the verge of the precipice, and cast myself\r\nfor ever beyond remembrance and beyond hope?\r\n\r\nStill I live: with this load upon my breast; with this phantom to pursue\r\nmy steps; with adders lodged in my bosom, and stinging me to madness:\r\nstill I consent to live!\r\n\r\nYes, I will rise above the sphere of mortal passions: I will spurn at\r\nthe cowardly remorse that bids me seek impunity in silence, or comfort\r\nin forgetfulness. My nerves shall be new strung to the task. Have I not\r\nresolved? I will die. The gulph before me is inevitable and near. I will\r\ndie, but then only when my tale is at an end.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter XXVI\r\n\r\n\r\nMy right hand, grasping the unseen knife, was still disengaged. It was\r\nlifted to strike. All my strength was exhausted, but what was sufficient\r\nto the performance of this deed. Already was the energy awakened,\r\nand the impulse given, that should bear the fatal steel to his heart,\r\nwhen--Wieland shrunk back: his hand was withdrawn. Breathless with\r\naffright and desperation, I stood, freed from his grasp; unassailed;\r\nuntouched.\r\n\r\nThus long had the power which controuled the scene forborne to\r\ninterfere; but now his might was irresistible, and Wieland in a moment\r\nwas disarmed of all his purposes. A voice, louder than human organs\r\ncould produce, shriller than language can depict, burst from the\r\nceiling, and commanded him--TO HOLD!\r\n\r\nTrouble and dismay succeeded to the stedfastness that had lately been\r\ndisplayed in the looks of Wieland. His eyes roved from one quarter to\r\nanother, with an expression of doubt. He seemed to wait for a further\r\nintimation.\r\n\r\nCarwin's agency was here easily recognized. I had besought him to\r\ninterpose in my defence. He had flown. I had imagined him deaf to my\r\nprayer, and resolute to see me perish: yet he disappeared merely to\r\ndevise and execute the means of my relief.\r\n\r\nWhy did he not forbear when this end was accomplished? Why did his\r\nmisjudging zeal and accursed precipitation overpass that limit? Or meant\r\nhe thus to crown the scene, and conduct his inscrutable plots to this\r\nconsummation?\r\n\r\nSuch ideas were the fruit of subsequent contemplation. This moment\r\nwas pregnant with fate. I had no power to reason. In the career of my\r\ntempestuous thoughts, rent into pieces, as my mind was, by accumulating\r\nhorrors, Carwin was unseen and unsuspected. I partook of Wieland's\r\ncredulity, shook with his amazement, and panted with his awe.\r\n\r\nSilence took place for a moment; so much as allowed the attention to\r\nrecover its post. Then new sounds were uttered from above.\r\n\r\n\"Man of errors! cease to cherish thy delusion: not heaven or hell, but\r\nthy senses have misled thee to commit these acts. Shake off thy phrenzy,\r\nand ascend into rational and human. Be lunatic no longer.\"\r\n\r\nMy brother opened his lips to speak. His tone was terrific and faint. He\r\nmuttered an appeal to heaven. It was difficult to comprehend the theme\r\nof his inquiries. They implied doubt as to the nature of the impulse\r\nthat hitherto had guided him, and questioned whether he had acted in\r\nconsequence of insane perceptions.\r\n\r\nTo these interrogatories the voice, which now seemed to hover at his\r\nshoulder, loudly answered in the affirmative. Then uninterrupted silence\r\nensued.\r\n\r\nFallen from his lofty and heroic station; now finally restored to the\r\nperception of truth; weighed to earth by the recollection of his own\r\ndeeds; consoled no longer by a consciousness of rectitude, for the\r\nloss of offspring and wife--a loss for which he was indebted to his own\r\nmisguided hand; Wieland was transformed at once into the man OF SORROWS!\r\n\r\nHe reflected not that credit should be as reasonably denied to the last,\r\nas to any former intimation; that one might as justly be ascribed to\r\nerring or diseased senses as the other. He saw not that this discovery\r\nin no degree affected the integrity of his conduct; that his motives had\r\nlost none of their claims to the homage of mankind; that the preference\r\nof supreme good, and the boundless energy of duty, were undiminished in\r\nhis bosom.\r\n\r\nIt is not for me to pursue him through the ghastly changes of his\r\ncountenance. Words he had none. Now he sat upon the floor, motionless in\r\nall his limbs, with his eyes glazed and fixed; a monument of woe.\r\n\r\nAnon a spirit of tempestuous but undesigning activity seized him.\r\nHe rose from his place and strode across the floor, tottering and at\r\nrandom. His eyes were without moisture, and gleamed with the fire\r\nthat consumed his vitals. The muscles of his face were agitated by\r\nconvulsion. His lips moved, but no sound escaped him.\r\n\r\nThat nature should long sustain this conflict was not to be believed.\r\nMy state was little different from that of my brother. I entered, as it\r\nwere, into his thought. My heart was visited and rent by his pangs--Oh\r\nthat thy phrenzy had never been cured! that thy madness, with its\r\nblissful visions, would return! or, if that must not be, that thy scene\r\nwould hasten to a close! that death would cover thee with his oblivion!\r\n\r\nWhat can I wish for thee? Thou who hast vied with the great preacher\r\nof thy faith in sanctity of motives, and in elevation above sensual and\r\nselfish! Thou whom thy fate has changed into paricide and savage! Can I\r\nwish for the continuance of thy being? No.\r\n\r\nFor a time his movements seemed destitute of purpose. If he walked; if\r\nhe turned; if his fingers were entwined with each other; if his hands\r\nwere pressed against opposite sides of his head with a force\r\nsufficient to crush it into pieces; it was to tear his mind from\r\nself-contemplation; to waste his thoughts on external objects.\r\n\r\nSpeedily this train was broken. A beam appeared to be darted into his\r\nmind, which gave a purpose to his efforts. An avenue to escape presented\r\nitself; and now he eagerly gazed about him: when my thoughts became\r\nengaged by his demeanour, my fingers were stretched as by a mechanical\r\nforce, and the knife, no longer heeded or of use, escaped from my grasp,\r\nand fell unperceived on the floor. His eye now lighted upon it; he\r\nseized it with the quickness of thought.\r\n\r\nI shrieked aloud, but it was too late. He plunged it to the hilt in his\r\nneck; and his life instantly escaped with the stream that gushed from\r\nthe wound. He was stretched at my feet; and my hands were sprinkled with\r\nhis blood as he fell.\r\n\r\nSuch was thy last deed, my brother! For a spectacle like this was it\r\nmy fate to be reserved! Thy eyes were closed--thy face ghastly with\r\ndeath--thy arms, and the spot where thou liedest, floated in thy life's\r\nblood! These images have not, for a moment, forsaken me. Till I am\r\nbreathless and cold, they must continue to hover in my sight.\r\n\r\nCarwin, as I said, had left the room, but he still lingered in the\r\nhouse. My voice summoned him to my aid; but I scarcely noticed his\r\nre-entrance, and now faintly recollect his terrified looks, his broken\r\nexclamations, his vehement avowals of innocence, the effusions of his\r\npity for me, and his offers of assistance.\r\n\r\nI did not listen--I answered him not--I ceased to upbraid or accuse. His\r\nguilt was a point to which I was indifferent. Ruffian or devil, black\r\nas hell or bright as angels, thenceforth he was nothing to me. I was\r\nincapable of sparing a look or a thought from the ruin that was spread\r\nat my feet.\r\n\r\nWhen he left me, I was scarcely conscious of any variation in the scene.\r\nHe informed the inhabitants of the hut of what had passed, and they flew\r\nto the spot. Careless of his own safety, he hasted to the city to inform\r\nmy friends of my condition.\r\n\r\nMy uncle speedily arrived at the house. The body of Wieland was removed\r\nfrom my presence, and they supposed that I would follow it; but no, my\r\nhome is ascertained; here I have taken up my rest, and never will I go\r\nhence, till, like Wieland, I am borne to my grave.\r\n\r\nImportunity was tried in vain: they threatened to remove me by\r\nviolence--nay, violence was used; but my soul prizes too dearly this\r\nlittle roof to endure to be bereaved of it. Force should not\r\nprevail when the hoary locks and supplicating tears of my uncle were\r\nineffectual. My repugnance to move gave birth to ferociousness and\r\nphrenzy when force was employed, and they were obliged to consent to my\r\nreturn.\r\n\r\nThey besought me--they remonstrated--they appealed to every duty that\r\nconnected me with him that made me, and with my fellow-men--in vain.\r\nWhile I live I will not go hence. Have I not fulfilled my destiny?\r\n\r\nWhy will ye torment me with your reasonings and reproofs? Can ye restore\r\nto me the hope of my better days? Can ye give me back Catharine and her\r\nbabes? Can ye recall to life him who died at my feet?\r\n\r\nI will eat--I will drink--I will lie down and rise up at your\r\nbidding--all I ask is the choice of my abode. What is there unreasonable\r\nin this demand? Shortly will I be at peace. This is the spot which I\r\nhave chosen in which to breathe my last sigh. Deny me not, I beseech\r\nyou, so slight a boon.\r\n\r\nTalk not to me, O my revered friend! of Carwin. He has told thee his\r\ntale, and thou exculpatest him from all direct concern in the fate of\r\nWieland. This scene of havock was produced by an illusion of the senses.\r\nBe it so: I care not from what source these disasters have flowed; it\r\nsuffices that they have swallowed up our hopes and our existence.\r\n\r\nWhat his agency began, his agency conducted to a close. He intended, by\r\nthe final effort of his power, to rescue me and to banish his illusions\r\nfrom my brother. Such is his tale, concerning the truth of which I care\r\nnot. Henceforth I foster but one wish--I ask only quick deliverance from\r\nlife and all the ills that attend it.--\r\n\r\nGo wretch! torment me not with thy presence and thy prayers.--Forgive\r\nthee? Will that avail thee when thy fateful hour shall arrive? Be thou\r\nacquitted at thy own tribunal, and thou needest not fear the verdict\r\nof others. If thy guilt be capable of blacker hues, if hitherto thy\r\nconscience be without stain, thy crime will be made more flagrant by\r\nthus violating my retreat. Take thyself away from my sight if thou\r\nwouldest not behold my death!\r\n\r\nThou are gone! murmuring and reluctant! And now my repose is coming--my\r\nwork is done!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter XXVII\r\n\r\n\r\n[Written three years after the foregoing, and dated at Montpellier.]\r\n\r\n\r\nI imagined that I had forever laid aside the pen; and that I should\r\ntake up my abode in this part of the world, was of all events the least\r\nprobable. My destiny I believed to be accomplished, and I looked forward\r\nto a speedy termination of my life with the fullest confidence.\r\n\r\nSurely I had reason to be weary of existence, to be impatient of every\r\ntie which held me from the grave. I experienced this impatience in its\r\nfullest extent. I was not only enamoured of death, but conceived, from\r\nthe condition of my frame, that to shun it was impossible, even though\r\nI had ardently desired it; yet here am I, a thousand leagues from my\r\nnative soil, in full possession of life and of health, and not destitute\r\nof happiness.\r\n\r\nSuch is man. Time will obliterate the deepest impressions. Grief the\r\nmost vehement and hopeless, will gradually decay and wear itself out.\r\nArguments may be employed in vain: every moral prescription may be\r\nineffectually tried: remonstrances, however cogent or pathetic, shall\r\nhave no power over the attention, or shall be repelled with disdain;\r\nyet, as day follows day, the turbulence of our emotions shall subside,\r\nand our fluctuations be finally succeeded by a calm.\r\n\r\nPerhaps, however, the conquest of despair was chiefly owing to an\r\naccident which rendered my continuance in my own house impossible. At\r\nthe conclusion of my long, and, as I then supposed, my last letter to\r\nyou, I mentioned my resolution to wait for death in the very spot which\r\nhad been the principal scene of my misfortunes. From this resolution my\r\nfriends exerted themselves with the utmost zeal and perseverance to make\r\nme depart. They justly imagined that to be thus surrounded by memorials\r\nof the fate of my family, would tend to foster my disease. A swift\r\nsuccession of new objects, and the exclusion of every thing calculated\r\nto remind me of my loss, was the only method of cure.\r\n\r\nI refused to listen to their exhortations. Great as my calamity was, to\r\nbe torn from this asylum was regarded by me as an aggravation of it. By\r\na perverse constitution of mind, he was considered as my greatest enemy\r\nwho sought to withdraw me from a scene which supplied eternal food to my\r\nmelancholy, and kept my despair from languishing.\r\n\r\nIn relating the history of these disasters I derived a similar species\r\nof gratification. My uncle earnestly dissuaded me from this task; but\r\nhis remonstrances were as fruitless on this head as they had been on\r\nothers. They would have withheld from me the implements of writing; but\r\nthey quickly perceived that to withstand would be more injurious than\r\nto comply with my wishes. Having finished my tale, it seemed as if the\r\nscene were closing. A fever lurked in my veins, and my strength was\r\ngone. Any exertion, however slight, was attended with difficulty, and,\r\nat length, I refused to rise from my bed.\r\n\r\nI now see the infatuation and injustice of my conduct in its true\r\ncolours. I reflect upon the sensations and reasonings of that period\r\nwith wonder and humiliation. That I should be insensible to the claims\r\nand tears of my friends; that I should overlook the suggestions of duty,\r\nand fly from that post in which only I could be instrumental to the\r\nbenefit of others; that the exercise of the social and beneficent\r\naffections, the contemplation of nature and the acquisition of wisdom\r\nshould not be seen to be means of happiness still within my reach, is,\r\nat this time, scarcely credible.\r\n\r\nIt is true that I am now changed; but I have not the consolation to\r\nreflect that my change was owing to my fortitude or to my capacity for\r\ninstruction. Better thoughts grew up in my mind imperceptibly. I cannot\r\nbut congratulate myself on the change, though, perhaps, it merely argues\r\na fickleness of temper, and a defect of sensibility.\r\n\r\nAfter my narrative was ended I betook myself to my bed, in the full\r\nbelief that my career in this world was on the point of finishing. My\r\nuncle took up his abode with me, and performed for me every office of\r\nnurse, physician and friend. One night, after some hours of restlessness\r\nand pain, I sunk into deep sleep. Its tranquillity, however, was of no\r\nlong duration. My fancy became suddenly distempered, and my brain was\r\nturned into a theatre of uproar and confusion. It would not be easy to\r\ndescribe the wild and phantastical incongruities that pestered me.\r\nMy uncle, Wieland, Pleyel and Carwin were successively and momently\r\ndiscerned amidst the storm. Sometimes I was swallowed up by whirlpools,\r\nor caught up in the air by half-seen and gigantic forms, and thrown upon\r\npointed rocks, or cast among the billows. Sometimes gleams of light\r\nwere shot into a dark abyss, on the verge of which I was standing, and\r\nenabled me to discover, for a moment, its enormous depth and hideous\r\nprecipices. Anon, I was transported to some ridge of AEtna, and made a\r\nterrified spectator of its fiery torrents and its pillars of smoke.\r\n\r\nHowever strange it may seem, I was conscious, even during my dream, of\r\nmy real situation. I knew myself to be asleep, and struggled to break\r\nthe spell, by muscular exertions. These did not avail, and I continued\r\nto suffer these abortive creations till a loud voice, at my bed side,\r\nand some one shaking me with violence, put an end to my reverie. My eyes\r\nwere unsealed, and I started from my pillow.\r\n\r\nMy chamber was filled with smoke, which, though in some degree luminous,\r\nwould permit me to see nothing, and by which I was nearly suffocated.\r\nThe crackling of flames, and the deafening clamour of voices without,\r\nburst upon my ears. Stunned as I was by this hubbub, scorched with heat,\r\nand nearly choaked by the accumulating vapours, I was unable to think or\r\nact for my own preservation; I was incapable, indeed, of comprehending\r\nmy danger.\r\n\r\nI was caught up, in an instant, by a pair of sinewy arms, borne to the\r\nwindow, and carried down a ladder which had been placed there. My\r\nuncle stood at the bottom and received me. I was not fully aware of my\r\nsituation till I found myself sheltered in the HUT, and surrounded by\r\nits inhabitants.\r\n\r\nBy neglect of the servant, some unextinguished embers had been placed in\r\na barrel in the cellar of the building. The barrel had caught fire;\r\nthis was communicated to the beams of the lower floor, and thence to the\r\nupper part of the structure. It was first discovered by some persons\r\nat a distance, who hastened to the spot and alarmed my uncle and the\r\nservants. The flames had already made considerable progress, and my\r\ncondition was overlooked till my escape was rendered nearly impossible.\r\n\r\nMy danger being known, and a ladder quickly procured, one of the\r\nspectators ascended to my chamber, and effected my deliverance in the\r\nmanner before related.\r\n\r\nThis incident, disastrous as it may at first seem, had, in reality, a\r\nbeneficial effect upon my feelings. I was, in some degree, roused from\r\nthe stupor which had seized my faculties. The monotonous and gloomy\r\nseries of my thoughts was broken. My habitation was levelled with the\r\nground, and I was obliged to seek a new one. A new train of images,\r\ndisconnected with the fate of my family, forced itself on my attention,\r\nand a belief insensibly sprung up, that tranquillity, if not happiness,\r\nwas still within my reach. Notwithstanding the shocks which my frame had\r\nendured, the anguish of my thoughts no sooner abated than I recovered my\r\nhealth.\r\n\r\nI now willingly listened to my uncle's solicitations to be the companion\r\nof his voyage. Preparations were easily made, and after a tedious\r\npassage, we set our feet on the shore of the ancient world. The memory\r\nof the past did not forsake me; but the melancholy which it generated,\r\nand the tears with which it filled my eyes, were not unprofitable. My\r\ncuriosity was revived, and I contemplated, with ardour, the spectacle of\r\nliving manners and the monuments of past ages.\r\n\r\nIn proportion as my heart was reinstated in the possession of its\r\nancient tranquillity, the sentiment which I had cherished with regard to\r\nPleyel returned. In a short time he was united to the Saxon woman,\r\nand made his residence in the neighbourhood of Boston. I was glad that\r\ncircumstances would not permit an interview to take place between us. I\r\ncould not desire their misery; but I reaped no pleasure from reflecting\r\non their happiness. Time, and the exertions of my fortitude, cured me,\r\nin some degree, of this folly. I continued to love him, but my passion\r\nwas disguised to myself; I considered it merely as a more tender species\r\nof friendship, and cherished it without compunction.\r\n\r\nThrough my uncle's exertions a meeting was brought about between Carwin\r\nand Pleyel, and explanations took place which restored me at once to\r\nthe good opinion of the latter. Though separated so widely our\r\ncorrespondence was punctual and frequent, and paved the way for that\r\nunion which can only end with the death of one of us.\r\n\r\nIn my letters to him I made no secret of my former sentiments. This\r\nwas a theme on which I could talk without painful, though not without\r\ndelicate emotions. That knowledge which I should never have imparted to\r\na lover, I felt little scruple to communicate to a friend.\r\n\r\nA year and an half elapsed when Theresa was snatched from him by death,\r\nin the hour in which she gave him the first pledge of their mutual\r\naffection. This event was borne by him with his customary fortitude. It\r\ninduced him, however, to make a change in his plans. He disposed of his\r\nproperty in America, and joined my uncle and me, who had terminated\r\nthe wanderings of two years at Montpellier, which will henceforth, I\r\nbelieve, be our permanent abode.\r\n\r\nIf you reflect upon that entire confidence which had subsisted from our\r\ninfancy between Pleyel and myself; on the passion that I had contracted,\r\nand which was merely smothered for a time; and on the esteem which was\r\nmutual, you will not, perhaps, be surprized that the renovation of our\r\nintercourse should give birth to that union which at present subsists.\r\nWhen the period had elapsed necessary to weaken the remembrance of\r\nTheresa, to whom he had been bound by ties more of honor than of love,\r\nhe tendered his affections to me. I need not add that the tender was\r\neagerly accepted.\r\n\r\nPerhaps you are somewhat interested in the fate of Carwin. He saw,\r\nwhen too late, the danger of imposture. So much affected was he by the\r\ncatastrophe to which he was a witness, that he laid aside all regard to\r\nhis own safety. He sought my uncle, and confided to him the tale which\r\nhe had just related to me. He found a more impartial and indulgent\r\nauditor in Mr. Cambridge, who imputed to maniacal illusion the conduct\r\nof Wieland, though he conceived the previous and unseen agency of\r\nCarwin, to have indirectly but powerfully predisposed to this deplorable\r\nperversion of mind.\r\n\r\nIt was easy for Carwin to elude the persecutions of Ludloe. It was\r\nmerely requisite to hide himself in a remote district of Pennsylvania.\r\nThis, when he parted from us, he determined to do. He is now probably\r\nengaged in the harmless pursuits of agriculture, and may come to think,\r\nwithout insupportable remorse, on the evils to which his fatal talents\r\nhave given birth. The innocence and usefulness of his future life may,\r\nin some degree, atone for the miseries so rashly or so thoughtlessly\r\ninflicted.\r\n\r\nMore urgent considerations hindered me from mentioning, in the course of\r\nmy former mournful recital, any particulars respecting the unfortunate\r\nfather of Louisa Conway. That man surely was reserved to be a monument\r\nof capricious fortune. His southern journies being finished, he returned\r\nto Philadelphia. Before he reached the city he left the highway, and\r\nalighted at my brother's door. Contrary to his expectation, no one came\r\nforth to welcome him, or hail his approach. He attempted to enter the\r\nhouse, but bolted doors, barred windows, and a silence broken only by\r\nunanswered calls, shewed him that the mansion was deserted.\r\n\r\nHe proceeded thence to my habitation, which he found, in like manner,\r\ngloomy and tenantless. His surprize may be easily conceived. The rustics\r\nwho occupied the hut told him an imperfect and incredible tale. He\r\nhasted to the city, and extorted from Mrs. Baynton a full disclosure of\r\nlate disasters.\r\n\r\nHe was inured to adversity, and recovered, after no long time, from\r\nthe shocks produced by this disappointment of his darling scheme. Our\r\nintercourse did not terminate with his departure from America. We have\r\nsince met with him in France, and light has at length been thrown upon\r\nthe motives which occasioned the disappearance of his wife, in the\r\nmanner which I formerly related to you.\r\n\r\nI have dwelt upon the ardour of their conjugal attachment, and mentioned\r\nthat no suspicion had ever glanced upon her purity. This, though\r\nthe belief was long cherished, recent discoveries have shewn to be\r\nquestionable. No doubt her integrity would have survived to the present\r\nmoment, if an extraordinary fate had not befallen her.\r\n\r\nMajor Stuart had been engaged, while in Germany, in a contest of\r\nhonor with an Aid de Camp of the Marquis of Granby. His adversary had\r\npropagated a rumour injurious to his character. A challenge was sent;\r\na meeting ensued; and Stuart wounded and disarmed the calumniator. The\r\noffence was atoned for, and his life secured by suitable concessions.\r\n\r\nMaxwell, that was his name, shortly after, in consequence of succeeding\r\nto a rich inheritance, sold his commission and returned to London. His\r\nfortune was speedily augmented by an opulent marriage. Interest was his\r\nsole inducement to this marriage, though the lady had been swayed by a\r\ncredulous affection. The true state of his heart was quickly discovered,\r\nand a separation, by mutual consent, took place. The lady withdrew to\r\nan estate in a distant county, and Maxwell continued to consume his time\r\nand fortune in the dissipation of the capital.\r\n\r\nMaxwell, though deceitful and sensual, possessed great force of mind and\r\nspecious accomplishments. He contrived to mislead the generous mind of\r\nStuart, and to regain the esteem which his misconduct, for a time, had\r\nforfeited. He was recommended by her husband to the confidence of Mrs.\r\nStuart. Maxwell was stimulated by revenge, and by a lawless passion, to\r\nconvert this confidence into a source of guilt.\r\n\r\nThe education and capacity of this woman, the worth of her husband, the\r\npledge of their alliance which time had produced, her maturity in\r\nage and knowledge of the world--all combined to render this attempt\r\nhopeless. Maxwell, however, was not easily discouraged. The most perfect\r\nbeing, he believed, must owe his exemption from vice to the absence of\r\ntemptation. The impulses of love are so subtile, and the influence of\r\nfalse reasoning, when enforced by eloquence and passion, so unbounded,\r\nthat no human virtue is secure from degeneracy. All arts being tried,\r\nevery temptation being summoned to his aid, dissimulation being carried\r\nto its utmost bound, Maxwell, at length, nearly accomplished his\r\npurpose. The lady's affections were withdrawn from her husband and\r\ntransferred to him. She could not, as yet, be reconciled to dishonor.\r\nAll efforts to induce her to elope with him were ineffectual. She\r\npermitted herself to love, and to avow her love; but at this limit she\r\nstopped, and was immoveable.\r\n\r\nHence this revolution in her sentiments was productive only of despair.\r\nHer rectitude of principle preserved her from actual guilt, but could\r\nnot restore to her her ancient affection, or save her from being the\r\nprey of remorseful and impracticable wishes. Her husband's absence\r\nproduced a state of suspense. This, however, approached to a period,\r\nand she received tidings of his intended return. Maxwell, being likewise\r\napprized of this event, and having made a last and unsuccessful effort\r\nto conquer her reluctance to accompany him in a journey to Italy,\r\nwhither he pretended an invincible necessity of going, left her to\r\npursue the measures which despair might suggest. At the same time she\r\nreceived a letter from the wife of Maxwell, unveiling the true character\r\nof this man, and revealing facts which the artifices of her seducer\r\nhad hitherto concealed from her. Mrs. Maxwell had been prompted to this\r\ndisclosure by a knowledge of her husband's practices, with which his own\r\nimpetuosity had made her acquainted.\r\n\r\nThis discovery, joined to the delicacy of her scruples and the anguish\r\nof remorse, induced her to abscond. This scheme was adopted in haste,\r\nbut effected with consummate prudence. She fled, on the eve of her\r\nhusband's arrival, in the disguise of a boy, and embarked at Falmouth in\r\na packet bound for America.\r\n\r\nThe history of her disastrous intercourse with Maxwell, the motives\r\ninducing her to forsake her country, and the measures she had taken\r\nto effect her design, were related to Mrs. Maxwell, in reply to her\r\ncommunication. Between these women an ancient intimacy and considerable\r\nsimilitude of character subsisted. This disclosure was accompanied with\r\nsolemn injunctions of secrecy, and these injunctions were, for a long\r\ntime, faithfully observed.\r\n\r\nMrs. Maxwell's abode was situated on the banks of the Wey. Stuart was\r\nher kinsman; their youth had been spent together; and Maxwell was in\r\nsome degree indebted to the man whom he betrayed, for his alliance with\r\nthis unfortunate lady. Her esteem for the character of Stuart had never\r\nbeen diminished. A meeting between them was occasioned by a tour which\r\nthe latter had undertaken, in the year after his return from America,\r\nto Wales and the western counties. This interview produced pleasure and\r\nregret in each. Their own transactions naturally became the topics of\r\ntheir conversation; and the untimely fate of his wife and daughter were\r\nrelated by the guest.\r\n\r\nMrs. Maxwell's regard for her friend, as well as for the safety of her\r\nhusband, persuaded her to concealment; but the former being dead,\r\nand the latter being out of the kingdom, she ventured to produce Mrs.\r\nStuart's letter, and to communicate her own knowledge of the treachery\r\nof Maxwell. She had previously extorted from her guest a promise not to\r\npursue any scheme of vengeance; but this promise was made while ignorant\r\nof the full extent of Maxwell's depravity, and his passion refused to\r\nadhere to it.\r\n\r\nAt this time my uncle and I resided at Avignon. Among the English\r\nresident there, and with whom we maintained a social intercourse, was\r\nMaxwell. This man's talents and address rendered him a favorite both\r\nwith my uncle and myself. He had even tendered me his hand in marriage;\r\nbut this being refused, he had sought and obtained permission to\r\ncontinue with us the intercourse of friendship. Since a legal marriage\r\nwas impossible, no doubt, his views were flagitious. Whether he had\r\nrelinquished these views I was unable to judge.\r\n\r\nHe was one in a large circle at a villa in the environs, to which I had\r\nlikewise been invited, when Stuart abruptly entered the apartment.\r\nHe was recognized with genuine satisfaction by me, and with seeming\r\npleasure by Maxwell. In a short time, some affair of moment being\r\npleaded, which required an immediate and exclusive interview, Maxwell\r\nand he withdrew together. Stuart and my uncle had been known to each\r\nother in the German army; and the purpose contemplated by the former in\r\nthis long and hasty journey, was confided to his old friend.\r\n\r\nA defiance was given and received, and the banks of a rivulet, about\r\na league from the city, was selected as the scene of this contest. My\r\nuncle, having exerted himself in vain to prevent an hostile meeting,\r\nconsented to attend them as a surgeon.--Next morning, at sun-rise, was\r\nthe time chosen.\r\n\r\nI returned early in the evening to my lodgings. Preliminaries being\r\nsettled between the combatants, Stuart had consented to spend the\r\nevening with us, and did not retire till late. On the way to his hotel\r\nhe was exposed to no molestation, but just as he stepped within the\r\nportico, a swarthy and malignant figure started from behind a column.\r\nand plunged a stiletto into his body.\r\n\r\nThe author of this treason could not certainly be discovered; but the\r\ndetails communicated by Stuart, respecting the history of Maxwell,\r\nnaturally pointed him out as an object of suspicion. No one expressed\r\nmore concern, on account of this disaster, than he; and he pretended\r\nan ardent zeal to vindicate his character from the aspersions that were\r\ncast upon it. Thenceforth, however, I denied myself to his visits; and\r\nshortly after he disappeared from this scene.\r\n\r\nFew possessed more estimable qualities, and a better title to happiness\r\nand the tranquil honors of long life, than the mother and father of\r\nLouisa Conway: yet they were cut off in the bloom of their days; and\r\ntheir destiny was thus accomplished by the same hand. Maxwell was the\r\ninstrument of their destruction, though the instrument was applied to\r\nthis end in so different a manner.\r\n\r\nI leave you to moralize on this tale. That virtue should become the\r\nvictim of treachery is, no doubt, a mournful consideration; but it will\r\nnot escape your notice, that the evils of which Carwin and Maxwell were\r\nthe authors, owed their existence to the errors of the sufferers. All\r\nefforts would have been ineffectual to subvert the happiness or shorten\r\nthe existence of the Stuarts, if their own frailty had not seconded\r\nthese efforts. If the lady had crushed her disastrous passion in the\r\nbud, and driven the seducer from her presence, when the tendency of\r\nhis artifices was seen; if Stuart had not admitted the spirit of absurd\r\nrevenge, we should not have had to deplore this catastrophe. If Wieland\r\nhad framed juster notions of moral duty, and of the divine attributes;\r\nor if I had been gifted with ordinary equanimity or foresight, the\r\ndouble-tongued deceiver would have been baffled and repelled.",
