He has resolutely shut his eyes to the allurements of\r\nthe many by-paths that constantly beckoned away from the historical\r\nhighway he was appointed to tread; and he has endeavored to keep this\r\nobject constantly in mind--to trace the development of the forces and\r\ntendencies from which have sprung the various musical forms that have\r\ngone to make up the literature of choral and church music as century\r\nfollowed century. In this volume, therefore, the great personalities\r\nof musical history will receive far less attention than the particular\r\nmusical forms and art-tendencies that flowed from their, oft-times,\r\ncombined creative activities.\r\n\r\nWhile a large number of choral and organ works of every class have been\r\nanalyzed with much detail and a still larger number given definite\r\nclassification, it is hoped that the historical summaries and the\r\ndiscussions of styles and periods, scattered throughout this volume,\r\nwill be even more helpful to the reader in enabling him to place\r\nany given musical work in its true musical, as well as historical,\r\nperspective. It is a matter of some regret that from sheer lack\r\nof space several interesting and wholly relevant topics--such as\r\nhymnology, contemporaneous church music, the whole relation of music to\r\nthe present-day church, etc.--must be left untouched. In the chapters\r\non contemporaneous choral music, it was necessary for the same reason\r\nto shut out of consideration the whole field of short cantata (for\r\nchurch choirs, and for female and male chorus), though the number of\r\nreally fine works here is quite amazing. Contemporaneous choral music\r\nis fully discussed in three chapters and a large number of works are\r\nadequately described, though for obvious reasons critical estimates are\r\nin the main impossible from the very propinquity of these works.\r\n\r\nGrateful acknowledgment is here made to Mr. Frederick H. Martens and to\r\nMr. Reginald L. McAll for the contribution of the comprehensive chapter\r\non the history of the organ (Chapter XIV), at the end of which their\r\ninitials will be found; also to Mr. Wilhelm Middelschulte, organist\r\nof the Chicago Symphony Orchestra, for many critical suggestions,\r\nespecially on the organ-works of Bach, Widor and Reger. In this\r\nconnection the author wishes to give full and grateful recognition to\r\nthe valuable assistance of his wife in gathering and verifying much\r\nhistorical material.\r\n\r\n                                              ROSSETTER G. COLE.\r\n\r\nChicago, August, 1915.\r\n\r\n\r\n                        CHORAL AND CHURCH MUSIC\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                             INTRODUCTION\r\n\r\n\r\n“And suddenly there was with the Angel a multitude of the heavenly\r\nhost praising God and saying, Glory to God in the highest and on earth\r\npeace, good will toward men.”\r\n\r\nThis choir of angels (for can we conceive of a multitude of angels\r\nannouncing this message otherwise than in well-ordered song?) typifies\r\nthe mission of choral singing.\r\n\r\nWhenever human beings unite in expressing noble thoughts in noble\r\nmusic, their message also is one of good will. Their speech is rendered\r\nin rhythmic cadence, intoned in harmonious concord and made expressive\r\nby melody; they are bound together in amicable union for a common\r\npurpose; they willingly submit to the discipline of a controlling mind;\r\ntheir object is to put beauty into the world and the peace and harmony\r\nwhich are required to make their work effective are communicated to\r\nthose who hear them and whose souls they cause to vibrate in unison\r\nwith their music.\r\n\r\nIt is not to be wondered at, therefore, that the practice of choral\r\nsinging dates back to very early times. Not, of course, in the way in\r\nwhich we understand the term to-day, as an art-form, but in cruder\r\nforms of singing or chanting in unison such as may still be heard among\r\nuncivilized or half-civilized tribes.\r\n\r\nThe desire to unite in the performance of religious rites, in prayers\r\nfor rain or in praise of the deity; in the mutual encouragement to do\r\nbattle against a common foe; in the celebration of seasonal changes,\r\nin rejoicing over the gifts of nature or the fruits of their toil at\r\nharvest time--all these common feelings induce a common expression and\r\nstimulate choral singing.\r\n\r\nThe development from these crude forms to the art-forms of the present\r\nhas not only extended over a long period, but has been affected and\r\ninfluenced by many and various factors. For purposes of discussion we\r\nmay divide these into two main classes: the Church and the Folk-song.\r\nThese two factors have brought to the evolution of choral singing\r\ncertain elements which, though diametrically opposed, yet most happily\r\ncomplement each other, namely, obedience to law and freedom of\r\nexpression.\r\n\r\nIn the nature of things music in the Church--the Roman Catholic and\r\nthe Greek Orthodox--had to adapt itself to the strict canons of the\r\nLiturgy. As the service became more and more elaborate and it was\r\nrealized that music exerted a strong spiritualizing influence, its use\r\nwas extended until it became one of the principal features in the Mass\r\nand required the participation of not only the regular clergy, but of\r\nnumerous trained auxiliaries. Thus it came to pass that the Church, to\r\nsatisfy its need for canonic music--that is, for music which met the\r\nliturgic requirements, preserved the dignity of the text and enhanced\r\nthe devotional attitude--stimulated the efforts toward greater beauty,\r\nvariety, and dignity of expression. Every monastery, every cathedral\r\ncontributed something to this evolutionary process until this primary\r\nstage of choral development culminated in the work of Palestrina. This\r\nwas accomplished by slow stages. The art of counterpoint, which forms\r\nthe basis of this art-form, grew very gradually from the combination\r\nof two voices to that of three, four, or more and incidentally caused\r\nto be discovered certain art-forms, such as the canon and the fugue,\r\nbased upon the principle of imitation, which have been employed by all\r\nthe great masters of musical composition to the present day.\r\n\r\nLet us now, for a moment, leave this field of choral development and\r\ngo into a small village in Russia. It is evening. The villagers are\r\nassembled under the spreading branches of an old linden tree whose\r\nblossoms perfume the still air as the moon rises above the forest.\r\nPresently one of the villagers intones a song. It is known to all, has\r\nbeen handed down from generation to generation. No one knows whence\r\nit came--it seems always to have been there and it is interwoven with\r\nthe memories and emotions of all the people of the village and of the\r\nwhole countryside. In a word--it is a folk-song. One after another\r\nthe villagers join in, some in unison with the tune, but others,\r\nfinding the range too high, endeavor to find tones which sound in\r\npleasing consonance, and so, gradually, there is evolved a full harmony\r\naccompanying the melody of the song. Has anyone taught the villagers\r\nthe science of harmony? Of course not, but, just as the beautiful\r\nmelody grew out of the people’s hearts and in the course of generations\r\nmolded itself into a perfect tune, so gradually the sense for good\r\nharmony grew and caused the elimination of unpleasing progressions.\r\nSometimes such a song tells a story which is developed in many stanzas.\r\nThen a ‘foresinger’ will chant the stanzas and the villagers will sing\r\na choral refrain, thus taking active part in the recital.\r\n\r\nThis, then, is the other source of choral singing which, meeting the\r\nstream coming from the church, soon united with it and helped to create\r\nand to develop this form of musical art.\r\n\r\nIn order to obtain a survey of the whole field of choral music as it\r\nhas grown from these two principal sources, let us enumerate it under\r\nthree divisions:\r\n\r\n1. As an expression of popular emotions and\r\nthoughts.\r\n\r\n    a.  Folk-songs and refrains.\r\n    b.  Dance songs.\r\n    c.  Marching and war songs.\r\n    d.  Work songs.\r\n    e.  National songs.\r\n\r\n\r\n2. For religious purposes.\r\n\r\n    a.  Masses, motets, chorales, and other church-music.\r\n    b.  Cantatas and oratorios.\r\n\r\n3. Miscellaneous forms for choral art.\r\n\r\n    a.  Part-songs, glees, madrigals, etc.\r\n    b.  Secular cantatas.\r\n    c.  As adjuncts to symphonic music.\r\n    d.  As component parts of the opera.\r\n\r\n\r\nThis shows the wide scope of choral singing and its possibilities for\r\ncoming into close relationship to every phase of human life.\r\n\r\nWhenever men come together for a common purpose involving the\r\nexpression of deep feelings or of their ideals, ordinary speech seems\r\ninadequate and recourse to united musical expression, that is, choral\r\nsinging, seems most appropriate. Hence, the choral folk-songs and\r\ndance-songs found in Russia, Scandinavia, Germany, and many other\r\nnations and races; the marching and war-songs which cause the heart to\r\nbeat faster and to enliven the spirits, which would otherwise droop\r\nfrom physical fatigue and hardships. Even where no spiritual element\r\nseems in evidence on the surface, as in the work in the fields, in the\r\nhauling of barges against the current of a great river, such as the\r\nVolga in Russia, in the cigar factories in Florida and in Cuba, or\r\nin heaving on a rope aboard ship, the mere working together of many\r\nin a common task causes them to lighten their labor by utterance of\r\nunited song. There is little doubt that labor is better done with\r\nthe accompaniment of singing by happy and contented workers. No\r\ndiscontented workman is inclined to sing. And when a great assemblage\r\nof people unites in the national hymn of its country, it must be a\r\ncallous soul and cold heart that does not try to join with ardor and\r\nenthusiasm.\r\n\r\nAll these manifestations of musical expression by popular singing\r\nmay be executed by comparatively untrained individuals. Even some\r\nquite unusual and interesting harmonic progressions, the result of\r\ngenerations of experiment and selection, as for instance in Finland,\r\nScandinavia, and among our Southern negroes, are not the result of\r\nindividual training, but part of the general racial instinct for\r\nmusical expression. The other classes of choral singing which we\r\nhave enumerated above require considerable training of individuals\r\nin order to produce satisfactory results. In other words, whereas\r\nthe folk-songs, dance, marching, and national songs were either the\r\nspontaneous expression of the people themselves or composed in the\r\nstyle of the people’s or folk-song whose chief centre of interest\r\nis the tune or melody while its harmonization is of secondary\r\nimportance, the choral art-songs, to which belong part-songs, glees,\r\nmadrigals, motets, cantatas, and all larger forms of choral music,\r\nemploy a much more elaborate style of composition. The different\r\nvoice-parts--soprano, alto, tenor, and bass--and their subdivisions\r\noften progress in rhythmic independence of each other. The voice-parts\r\nmay enter the song at different times, in different sequence, in\r\ndifferent metrical and rhythmical figures; they may sing different\r\nwords simultaneously and therefore give different expression; sometimes\r\none voice-part requires dynamic prominence, sometimes another, while\r\nthe other voices subordinate themselves. All this requires that the\r\nindividual singer must have a musical voice and true ear and a good\r\nsense of rhythm; that he should understand the rudimentary science of\r\nmusic and of notation; and that his eye should be able to recognize\r\nthe symbols which indicate the pitch and time value of sounds and\r\ntranslate them instantly into the sounds themselves. Also, it requires\r\nthat the individuals submit to the strictest discipline in obeying\r\nthe directions of the leader. Only complete, intelligent, and instant\r\nobedience to the director on the part of every member of the chorus\r\nwill produce good results. In other words, only team-work of the\r\nhighest type secures mastery.\r\n\r\nEfficiency in the performance of choral works of art, therefore,\r\ndemands the following conditions: First, a leader who is a thorough,\r\ntrained musician; cultured and well-educated; of good character and\r\nwith high ideals and noble aims; of good personality, courteous but\r\nstrict in discipline; critical but not discouraging; energetic and\r\nenthusiastic, but always within the limits of dignity. Second, a\r\nchorus composed of singers who sing because they love to sing (paid or\r\nunpaid), who are gladly willing to obey the leader’s direction, and\r\nwho will concentrate themselves upon their work throughout the period\r\nof rehearsal or performance. Their degree of vocal excellence, musical\r\nqualities, individual musical knowledge and training will determine the\r\nmagnitude of the task upon which the leader may direct their efforts\r\nand also the degree of excellence which their performance can attain.\r\n\r\nIn the United States there exist innumerable organizations devoted\r\nto the study of choral music in its various forms, and it may be of\r\ninterest to enumerate some of the principal kinds.\r\n\r\n\r\n1. The church congregation which sings hymns either in unison\r\n   or in four-part harmony in a more or less happy-go-lucky\r\n   fashion.\r\n\r\n2. The church choir composed of male and female voices or\r\n   of boys’ and men’s voices.\r\n\r\n3. The societies devoted to the study of oratorios and cantatas.\r\n\r\n4. The societies devoted to the study of unaccompanied choral\r\n   singing (_a cappella_, as it is called), such as madrigals,\r\n   glees, motets, etc.\r\n\r\n5. Male choruses, such as the German singing societies and the\r\n   glee clubs.\r\n\r\n6. Choruses of women’s voices.\r\n\r\n7. Opera choruses.\r\n\r\n8. Choruses of school-children.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe great majority of these organizations consists of amateurs,\r\nthat is, of people who love music and who find in choral singing an\r\nopportunity to gratify their desire to take an active part in its\r\nperformance.\r\n\r\nEven those whose voices are of mediocre quality and have had little or\r\nno training can learn to do excellent work in large choruses in which\r\nthe individual voice is merged in the mass. An example of this may be\r\nfound in the People’s Singing Classes and in the People’s Choral Union\r\nof New York. Applicants to the former are admitted without vocal or\r\nmusical examination. They are taught to sing from notes, to follow the\r\nbâton of the leader, to phrase and enunciate correctly, and to produce\r\na musical quality of tone. After two seasons they are promoted into the\r\nChoral Union and are capable of singing the choruses of the oratorios\r\nby Handel, Mendelssohn, and the modern masters. Their work has been\r\nhighly praised by the principal music critics and they have given and\r\nare still giving pleasure to thousands of people at their concerts.\r\n\r\nSocieties like the Oratorio Society of New York, the Handel and Haydn\r\nof Boston, the Apollo Club of Chicago, and numerous similar ones in\r\nnearly every city are also composed of amateurs, but admission is\r\nobtained only after proof of good vocal material and ability to sing at\r\nsight has been given. This enables such organizations to perform with a\r\nhigh degree of artistic finish and to produce a number of large works\r\nevery season.\r\n\r\nThe male societies, such as glee clubs and _Deutsche Gesangvereine_,\r\ncultivate a lighter class of music, but they sometimes reach a high\r\ndegree of vocal excellence and finish in diction and phrasing. They\r\nafford a welcome relief from work, business cares, and mental strain to\r\nmany men who like to sing and who enjoy the weekly rehearsals and the\r\nsocial intercourse with congenial men which usually follows the drill.\r\n\r\nThe women’s choruses are not as numerous nor as popular as the\r\nmen’s, but seem to be growing more so every year. It is difficult to\r\nunderstand why male choral singing should have developed more quickly\r\nand more widely, as women are usually more interested in music than the\r\naverage man. Perhaps there is a psychological reason for it!\r\n\r\nChoruses of children’s voices are among the most delightful\r\nmanifestations in the realm of music when they are well trained. Our\r\npublic schools throughout the country have the best possible machinery\r\nfor their development, and wherever this is guided by a good musician\r\nand competent organizer the results are very beautiful. It is a great\r\npity, therefore, that the start in the direction of choral singing\r\ngiven in the schools to hundreds of thousands of children every year\r\nshould not be systematically followed up by providing municipal evening\r\nsinging classes, either in the school buildings or in other suitable\r\nhalls provided by the city. Such classes would tend enormously to\r\nuplift the young people who are just beginning life by giving them\r\nopportunity to meet their friends under clean and pleasant conditions,\r\nto enjoy the study of beautiful music and thereby to put into their\r\nlives something which will help to lift them above the purely material\r\nthoughts and commonplace existence which are so often the lot of the\r\nwage-earner.\r\n\r\nThere remains only the consideration of the various kinds of\r\nprofessional choruses. Of these, the church choir is the most\r\nfrequently met with. As a rule, it is little better than the average\r\namateur chorus, the members receiving a nominal fee, chiefly in order\r\nto insure their regular attendance at rehearsals and services. But\r\nthere are some notable exceptions in the case of wealthy congregations\r\nwho spend whatever may be necessary to secure a highly gifted\r\nand thoroughly competent choir-master, good voices, and frequent\r\nrehearsals. In some cases there have been established richly endowed\r\nchoir schools in which boys gifted with good voices receive not only\r\nmusical training, but an excellent general education sufficient to\r\nprepare them for college.\r\n\r\nThe grand opera choruses have, until recently, been largely recruited\r\nfrom Italy and Germany, but now they include many young American men\r\nand women whose fresh voices and intelligent application are looked\r\nupon as welcome additions both by the conductors and the public. As\r\ninterest in opera grows and as operatic institutions are established in\r\na larger number of cities, this career will attract many young people\r\nwhose voices are not of such quality as to promise success as soloists,\r\nbut who are musical and prefer work along artistic lines to the more\r\nmechanical business or trade occupations.\r\n\r\nFinally, mention must be made of a kind of choral singing which, at its\r\nbest, is to vocal music what chamber music is to instrumental, namely,\r\n_a cappella_ singing.\r\n\r\nDating from the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries, when the old\r\nItalian and Flemish masters of church music laid the foundations of\r\ntheir wonderful contrapuntal style which culminated in the work of\r\nPalestrina, this form of unaccompanied choral singing has flourished\r\nto the present day, producing exquisite blossoms in every succeeding\r\nage and in nearly every country which has cultivated a love of music.\r\nMuch of this class of music requires highly skilled singers, thorough\r\nmusical training and expert leadership, and it is therefore desirable\r\nto secure professional singers when this is possible. The Musical\r\nArt Society of New York and other societies with similar aims devote\r\nthemselves to this type of choral singing. Their choirs usually consist\r\nof professional singers and their programs embrace works by Palestrina,\r\nOrlando di Lasso, and their contemporaries and successors--Bach,\r\nGibbons, Morley, Wilbye, and other English madrigalists; the masters\r\nof the German romantic school; Russian, Scandinavian, and Celtic\r\npart-songs; Cornelius, Brahms, and the modern composers of all nations.\r\n\r\nFrom the foregoing recital of the wide scope of this important branch\r\nof musical art and its general practice by all classes of people, it\r\nwould appear that choral singing is that form of music which is best\r\nadapted to popular use and that it is one of the easiest and best means\r\nto promote the love and culture of good music in the community.\r\n\r\nThrough the musical experience gained in the study of choral works\r\nand because of the pleasure it gives to the participants, interest is\r\naroused in other forms of musical art. Those who are engaged in trying\r\nto awaken the American people to the appreciation of music by means\r\nof recitals by singers, pianists, and violinists; by chamber music,\r\nsymphony concerts, and opera, will find more ready response from people\r\nwho have entered the field of music apprehension through choral singing\r\nthan through any other medium except the thorough training of a good\r\nmusic school, and this contingent is, as yet, comparatively small. It\r\nis to be hoped that, as the value of choral singing as a community\r\nasset becomes more generally recognized, public education boards and\r\ncivic societies will give the fullest encouragement to its practice by\r\nthe people at large. It is not too much to say that twenty per cent.\r\nof the adults of every city could become qualified to take part in\r\nchoral singing, and this opens up marvellous possibilities.\r\n\r\nSuch civic choruses could assist in the celebration of the national\r\nholidays, of festivities in memory of great events, in exercises\r\ndesigned to honor a famous man; in short, they would be a true people’s\r\nvoice expressing a people’s emotions, aspirations, and ideals.

The earliest music of which we have any knowledge is\r\nmonophonic, a single melody sung by a single voice, or by a number\r\nof voices in unison or in octaves. This characteristic prevails not\r\nonly in the music of primitive races, ancient or modern, but also in\r\nthe music of those ancient nations that attained a high degree of\r\ncivilization--Greeks, Romans, Egyptians, Assyrians, Hebrews. The Greeks\r\nand Egyptians understood thoroughly the theory of intervals and they\r\npossessed an adequate comprehension of intervals in the melodic sense,\r\nwhere tone follows tone. But it seems never to have occurred to them to\r\napply this knowledge of intervals to sounds of different pitch heard\r\nsimultaneously, certainly never seriously enough to lead them to make\r\nexperiments in the use of these intervals for the purpose of evolving\r\ntwo or more independent melodies or voice-parts sounding at the same\r\ntime. Even the crude device of having two melodies move in parallel\r\nfifths or fourths, as in the _organum_ of Hucbald, was not employed\r\nuntil the tenth century of the Christian era. And, the principle of\r\ndiscant or added parts to a given melody having been once established,\r\nit required nearly six centuries more of constant experimentation\r\nwith vocal part-writing before there emerged any clear or conscious\r\nfeeling for what we call harmony or a progression of chord-units. Since\r\nthe sixteenth century, however, musical progress has unfolded with\r\nconstantly accelerated pace.\r\n\r\nUntil about the beginning of the seventeenth century, when secularity\r\nentered the domain of music and received such important consideration\r\nin the development of dramatic and instrumental music, practically the\r\nwhole creative energy of art-music had been expended in the interest\r\nof religion. From the earliest times the most important music of\r\nthe Greeks, Egyptians, Assyrians, and Hebrews was associated with\r\ntheir respective religious rites and ceremonies. Roman civilization\r\ncontributed nothing of importance to the musical knowledge or practices\r\nof its time, for militant Rome was far more interested in assimilating\r\nfrom the culture of conquered countries than in originating and\r\ndeveloping practices of her own. Even the dawn of the Christian era,\r\nwith the tremendous dynamics of its new moral and ethical ideals and\r\nits prophecy of intellectual freedom, did not usher in any essential\r\ndeparture from the old musical usages. The early Christians merely\r\nselected from current musical systems and contemporaneous melodies\r\nthose elements that were best suited to the services of the new\r\nreligion and to the religious home life of its adherents. Until the\r\nperiod of open persecution set in, the converts to the new religion\r\ndid not in general follow a social or economic life that differed in\r\nany essential respects from that of their neighbors who still paid\r\nhomage to the old forms and trod the old paths of religious worship.\r\nThe believers in the new and the old forms of religion mingled freely\r\nin the daily rounds of their various duties and pleasures. Just as the\r\nearly Christian art did not differ in principle from the best Pagan\r\nmodels, so the music of the early Christian congregations was absorbed\r\ninto their services from the musical practices of the communities from\r\nwhich the converts came. Those in the East naturally turned for their\r\nmusical material to the noble melodies of the Hebrew synagogue and to\r\nthe more chaste Greek melodies whose association was farther removed\r\nfrom sensual Pagan rites. Those in the West borrowed freely from\r\ncurrent Græco-Roman music, employing, of course, only those melodies\r\nthat were purest and most refined in character and association.\r\n\r\nFrom this point of contact with the old civilization, the music of\r\nthe early Christian worship gradually developed along the line of its\r\nown inherent and individual needs and kept pace with the internal\r\nunfoldment of the liturgic idea that at an early date imbedded itself\r\nfirmly in all branches of the church services. The line of continuity\r\nin passing from the old to the new, however, was unbroken. Public\r\nceremonials and priestly sacrifices have always produced conditions\r\nexceedingly favorable to the development of rituals and liturgies.\r\nThis was conspicuously true of the Hebrew religion, as well as the\r\nPagan religions which were practised in the opening centuries of the\r\nChristian era. It is not altogether surprising, then, that many Pagan\r\nideas, forms, and ceremonials were incorporated into the ritual and\r\nliturgy of the early church, especially after the third century, when\r\nChristianity was received into the favor of the State.\r\n\r\nWhile the organization of the early Christian church was still\r\nsimple and its government more or less democratic in character,\r\nthe congregation took an active part in the musical portion of the\r\nservice. But the gradual development of elaborate liturgies and\r\nceremonies, the transformation of the clergy from representatives of\r\nthe people to mediatorial functionaries, and the general hierarchical\r\ntendencies of the times--all contributed in bringing about a condition\r\ndistinctly unfavorable to free congregational singing. Indeed, this was\r\nspecifically forbidden in all liturgical services by the Council of\r\nLaodicea (343-381), and while the transfer of the office of song from\r\nthe people to the clergy was not immediately effective, congregational\r\nsinging in the apostolic sense passed out of existence in the fourth\r\ncentury. It is true that in private worship and in non-liturgical\r\nservices the singing of hymns and psalms by the general body of\r\nworshippers was permitted, but the rapid growth of sacerdotalism\r\nirresistibly led to the corresponding withdrawal of initiative from the\r\nindividual worshippers, until the clergy in all liturgical services\r\nfinally assumed all the offices of public worship, inclusive of song,\r\nwhich was regarded as an integral part of the office of prayer.\r\n\r\nThe establishment of the priestly liturgic chant marks the real\r\nbeginning of the history of music in the Christian church, for music\r\nafter that event became a matter of special qualifications and\r\npreparation on the part of the performers, and of rigid adherence to\r\nprescribed formulas and regulations in all details of performance. It\r\nfollowed with utmost logic from the doctrine of the universality and\r\nimmutability of the church that its liturgy, rites, and ceremonies\r\nshould not only remain unchanged from age to age, but should be uniform\r\nin all countries and localities where her authority was recognized.\r\n\r\nIn the study of the Roman Catholic liturgy its alliance with music\r\nmust be kept constantly in mind, for in inception and in development it\r\nwas and always has been a musical liturgy. In working out the problems\r\nof securing the desired uniformity in respect to musical settings for\r\ndifferent localities and of handing down to succeeding generations\r\nthe musical forms that had gained the sanction of church authority,\r\nthe church fathers were confronted with difficulties the magnitude\r\nof which it is not easy for us to comprehend. It was not until the\r\neleventh century that a system of staff notation was devised whereby\r\nthe exact pitch of notes could be accurately represented, and a full\r\ncentury elapsed after this vital invention before an adequate system of\r\nmeasured music was evolved whereby the exact relative duration of notes\r\ncould be represented. A detailed account of the slow and laborious\r\ndevelopment of the elementary material out of which the fair edifice of\r\nmodern music was finally to be reared will be found in Vol. I of this\r\nseries. It will suffice here to say that the authorized versions of the\r\nvarious chants, as the liturgy was gradually taking definite and final\r\nshape during the fourth, fifth, and sixth centuries, had to be taught\r\nand preserved by ‘word of mouth,’ this process being somewhat aided,\r\nthrough visual association, by means of a kind of musical shorthand\r\ncalled ‘neumes,’ consisting of dots, short lines and combinations\r\nof lines written over the syllables to be sung, which indicated the\r\ngeneral direction of the melody but not the exact intervals between\r\nits tones as it fluctuated up and down in pitch. Even this crude\r\nsystem of representing pitch relations by visual symbols was of great\r\nassistance to the singers, for in principle it sought to serve the same\r\npurpose that our modern notation accomplishes in suggesting to the\r\neve the outline of the melody. Indefinite as it was in not indicating\r\nexact intervallic relations, it greatly aided in recalling to mind the\r\nmelodies already memorized, assistance which was greatly appreciated\r\nby the singers, for as many as a thousand different melodies were used\r\nduring the church year, many of them for a single occasion only.\r\n\r\nTo eliminate conflicting traditions and to bring about uniformity in\r\nall branches of the service, singing schools were established by order\r\nand under the direction of ecclesiastical authorities (the first one in\r\n314 at Rome by Pope Sylvester), in which the clerical singers received\r\nthorough instruction and training not only in the exact forms of all\r\nthe chants to be used, but also in all matters of intonation, qualities\r\nof tone suited to different chants, enunciation, etc. These schools\r\n(_scholæ cantorum_) brought about as much uniformity and permanency\r\nas were possible in the absence of more exact notational means. But\r\neven with these great handicaps, a wealth of musical material was\r\naccumulated even before the twelfth century, whose plenitude and\r\naffluent beauty it would seem have never been rightly appreciated\r\nor exploited by the Catholic Church itself. The difficulties in\r\ndeciphering the vague neumes in the mediæval manuscripts have\r\nundoubtedly operated to keep these treasures hidden away in their\r\noriginal depositories; yet the results of the labors of occasional\r\nenthusiasts in translating some of them into modern notation would\r\nindicate that here are unexplored channels for the permanent enrichment\r\nof the literature of Catholic music. In his _motu propria_ of November\r\n22, 1903, Pope Pius X turned the attention of the Catholic world back\r\nto the glories of the mediæval Gregorian music and, indirectly, to the\r\nold manuscripts, treasure-stores of long forgotten melodies of the\r\nold church singers that are still hidden away in the monasteries and\r\nabbeys of Europe and northern Africa, as well as in the more accessible\r\nmuseums and libraries of Europe.\r\n\r\nThe earliest known manuscripts date from the eighth, possibly the\r\nsixth, century. But aside from the traditional music of the liturgy,\r\nhanded down from generation to generation by word of mouth and\r\npreserved intact, in Rome at least, by the severe discipline of the\r\nsinging schools, we possess very few examples of music whose origin can\r\nwith certainty be placed before the eleventh century, when our present\r\nstaff notation came into being. Yet even with so little actual music\r\nof the period at hand we know with great definiteness the character of\r\necclesiastical music from contemporary writings, edicts, and decrees.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                   II\r\n\r\nWhen early Christian music finally freed itself from the influence\r\nof Pagan models in the interest of its own internal necessities, it\r\nopened the way for the first time in history for the development of a\r\npurely vocal art, dispensing with the assistance of the instruments\r\nthat formed such an essential part of the musical practices allied with\r\nPagan religious rites and ceremonies. For the first fifteen centuries\r\nof the Christian era almost the only art-music was that which was\r\ncultivated by and for the church, and since the church during this\r\nperiod persistently frowned upon the use of instruments, the history of\r\nthe music of the period is the history of choral music.\r\n\r\nBut while in Italy the use of instruments was rigidly forbidden and\r\nany deviation from prescribed practices was a punishable offense,\r\ngreater difficulty was experienced in enforcing this church law in\r\nthose countries of Europe, now known as France, Germany, and England,\r\nwhich had more recently been won to the standard of Christianity by\r\nthe militant missionaries of Rome, but which still retained a rugged\r\nindependence that clung tenaciously to many local customs. In some of\r\nthese localities instruments were freely used and in the monastery\r\nof St. Gall in Switzerland festival occasions were graced by a band\r\nof harps, flutes, cymbals, a seven-stringed psaltery, and an organ.\r\nNotwithstanding a few noteworthy exceptions, the music of the Roman\r\nChurch can be characterized as pure vocal music until near the end of\r\nthe sixteenth century at least. And when instruments were occasionally\r\nused--the organ more and more toward the end of the sixteenth\r\ncentury--it was for the purpose of doubling the voice-parts in order to\r\ngain greater sonority.\r\n\r\nAfter the office of song was restricted to specially trained\r\nclericals, thus bringing music within the domain of culture and\r\nlaying the foundation for its development as an art, the first name\r\nof importance among those who strove to bring order and increased\r\neffectiveness into the chaotic conditions of liturgical music was St.\r\nAmbrose, Bishop of Milan (340?-397). Much that was attributed to him\r\nuntil a few decades ago has been proved to be apocryphal and legendary.\r\nWe may with much certainty, however, affirm that his enthusiastic\r\ninterest in the music of the liturgy resulted (1) in carefully sifting\r\nthe material that had been gradually accumulating, and (2) in bringing\r\ninto the ritual of the Western church from the Eastern three elements\r\nof great value to its further development--antiphonal singing of psalms\r\nby two alternating choirs, responsorial singing, and Greek hymnody. His\r\ngreat interest in the last-named field led him not only to translate\r\nmany of the finest Greek hymns into Latin, but inspired him to write\r\nnew Latin hymns to be sung, probably to simple melodies, after the\r\nGreek fashion. Among the hymns (about ten in number) from his own pen\r\nmay be named _Veni Redemptor Gentium_ and _Eterna Christi Munera_\r\n(‘Hymnal Noted,’ Nos. 12 and 36).\r\n\r\nSt. Ambrose’s innovations soon found favor elsewhere. Antiphonal\r\npsalmody was introduced into the service at Rome by Pope Celestine\r\n(pope from 422 to 432), and in a short time was quite generally adopted\r\nthroughout the domains of the church. St. Augustine (354-430), who\r\nwas a friend of St. Ambrose and a collaborator with him, and who is\r\nsaid to have made a collection of Ambrosian melodies for the use of\r\nthe church, bears touching testimony to their emotional effect: ‘How\r\nI wept at thy hymns and canticles, pierced to the quick by the voices\r\nof thy melodious church! Those voices flowed into my ears, and the\r\ntruth distilled into my heart, and thence there streamed forth a\r\ndevout emotion, and my tears ran down, and happy was I therein.’ (St.\r\nAugustine, ‘Confessions,’ Book 9, chap. 6.)\r\n\r\nThe so-called Ambrosian collection vied in importance with the\r\nGregorian for several centuries and many of its finest features\r\nwere undoubtedly incorporated into the later and more comprehensive\r\ncollection. So important a place does St. Ambrose fill in the history\r\nof ecclesiastical music that the term Ambrosian is still applied to\r\nusages, both liturgical and musical, of the Church of Milan, which\r\ndistinguish its service in certain respects from the Roman service, and\r\nwhich are supposed to have been originated by the great Milanese bishop.\r\n\r\nAfter St. Ambrose the next prelate to impress himself profoundly on\r\nthe course of development of church-music was Pope Gregory the Great\r\n(pope from 590 to 604). While recent research[1] has proved beyond\r\ndoubt that a multitude of reforms and innovations attributed to him\r\nby mediæval legends and repeated by later history belong in reality\r\nto a much later period, it is well established that he manifested an\r\nenthusiastic and well-directed interest in the music of the service,\r\nthat he introduced many corrective measures to curb the growing\r\ndanger of secularizing church-music through the use of unauthorized\r\nembellishments and licenses in singing the chants, and that he brought\r\nabout a thorough and far-reaching reorganization of the singing\r\nschools. When he became pope in 590, the liturgy was practically\r\ncompleted as far as its actual material was concerned. Since the\r\nearliest practices of the church had encouraged a musical liturgy,\r\nhe found in actual use a vast number of chants and musical settings\r\nfor various parts of the services. These musical settings differed\r\nin different localities. In conformity with his definitely conceived\r\npolicy of establishing in reality one universal church for all peoples\r\nand races, with centralized power and highly-organized form of\r\ngovernment, he set about to accomplish a definite systematization and\r\nan authoritative organization of all liturgic functions, together with\r\nthe necessarily similar regulation of the music associated with the\r\nliturgy. This reform was in the nature of a codification of existing\r\nmaterial, and while he did not finish the great work, he brought it\r\nwithin the bounds of uniformity as regards both liturgy and musical\r\nsettings, and gave to these results of his labors all the permanency\r\nthat the solemn law of the church could command. The liturgical portion\r\nwas called _Sacramentarium Gregorianum_ and the musical portion\r\n_Antiphonarium Gregorianum_, and from the seventh century these two\r\nbooks are always met with side by side.\r\n\r\nThe interesting and fanciful stories of Pope Gregory’s labors as\r\ncomposer of chants and as teacher in the _Schola Cantorum_ must be\r\ndiscarded as wholly unproven legends, and to the same category belongs\r\nthe tradition that after compiling the Antiphonary he caused a copy\r\nof it to be chained to the altar of St. Peter’s, as containing the\r\nonly music authorized by the church. One of the direct results of his\r\nreorganization of the singing school, however, was the establishment\r\non a permanent basis of the Sistine Chapel,[2] or papal choir, at\r\nRome. This organization, the oldest choral body in the world, was\r\nfor centuries the court of final resort in all matters pertaining to\r\nthe traditions of Gregorian chant and it maintained a practically\r\ncontinuous existence from that far-off age until the temporal power of\r\nthe pope came to an end in 1870, when it was practically disbanded.\r\nSince that date, however, its members have from time to time been\r\ncalled together to sing in the Sistine Chapel on occasions of special\r\nsignificance.\r\n\r\nThe Gregorian collection or antiphonary, which was the musical law\r\nof the Roman Church until the Renaissance period, was probably not\r\nsettled in final form until the time of Gregory II (pope 715-731) or\r\nGregory III (pope 731-741). However much Gregory the Great may have\r\naccomplished in establishing methods of permanency and universality\r\nin the ritual-music, the processes of selection, accretion, and\r\nassimilation went on for more than a century after his death. This\r\ncollection, which was written in the vague neumes of the period, became\r\nthe most important factor in the music of the Western church and by\r\nthe end of, the eleventh century had practically superseded all other\r\nbodies of ritual-music--such as the African, Celtic, Gallican, and\r\nSpanish[3] (Mozarabic)--which had previously gained ascendency in the\r\nvarious countries which acknowledged spiritual allegiance to Rome.\r\n\r\nThe historic collection of Gregorian music divides itself into two\r\nlarge groups--(1) the music of the Mass, together with that of the\r\nbaptismal, burial, and other occasional services, corresponding with\r\nthe modern Missal, and (2) the music of the daily Hours of Divine\r\nService, corresponding with the modern Breviary. There are about\r\n630 compositions in the first large group, in which only scriptural\r\nwords appear, classified as follows: about 150 Introits (_Antiphonæ\r\nad introitum_), about 150 Communions (_Antiphonæ ad communionem_),\r\n110 Graduals, 100 Alleluias, 23 Tracts, and 102 Offertories. In the\r\nmusic of the second large division (the Hours of Divine Service) there\r\nis much less variety than in the music of the Mass. As this group of\r\nservices did not have the same official position as the Mass, less\r\nrestraint was exercised in regard to modifications. In this collection\r\nare to be found some 2,000 antiphons and about 800 Greater Responds,\r\nbesides many Lesser Responds, Invitatories, and Versicles.\r\n\r\nIt is now quite generally believed that there were no essential\r\ndifferences between Ambrosian and Gregorian music. If any differences\r\nexisted, they were in such compositions as the Ambrosian hymn, which\r\nwas written for the use of the congregation and was more measured and\r\nstately in its swing than its Gregorian counterpart, which was sung by\r\nthe trained choirs and therefore capable of much more rhythmic freedom\r\nand melodic embellishment.\r\n\r\nThe Roman singing school (_Schola Cantorum_) played a large and\r\nimportant part both in the labor of codifying the great collection\r\nsince known as Gregorian music, and in spreading the Gregorian chant\r\namong the faithful in other lands. This latter task was greatly\r\nfacilitated by the establishment of numerous singing schools, modelled\r\nafter the Roman school, in England, France, and Germany, under the\r\nauspices of monastic orders or powerful prelates. Among the most famous\r\nof these schools were the one at Metz, founded by Bishop Chrodegang,\r\nwhich maintained great prestige up to the twelfth century; the one at\r\nOxford, founded by Alfred the Great; the monastic school of Fulda,\r\nwhich held the foremost place in Germany; and the one at St. Gall,\r\nSwitzerland, whose fame and achievements eclipsed all the others and\r\nwhich was celebrated far and near for the elaborateness and excellence\r\nof its musical service and for the devotion and enthusiasm of its\r\nmonks in the advancement of ecclesiastical music during the eighth,\r\nthe ninth, and especially the tenth century. England became acquainted\r\nwith Gregorian chant during the lifetime of Gregory the Great, when St.\r\nAugustine (not to be confused with the Latin father) was commissioned\r\nin 597 as an apostle to carry Christianity to the island across the\r\nchannel. In France and Germany (Franconia and Allemania) Pepin,[4]\r\nand especially Charlemagne, gave energetic and active support to the\r\nmovement to bring about uniformity with Rome, and by the beginning of\r\nthe ninth century the Gregorian chant had supplanted the old Gallican\r\nchant in all the domains of the great emperor. Spain, however, did not\r\naccept the Gregorian chant until the eleventh century, during the reign\r\nof Pope Gregory VII.\r\n\r\nThe inexact system of notation (neumes) in which the Gregorian\r\nantiphonary was written necessarily laid great emphasis on the oral\r\ntransmission of the melodies, hence it was hardly possible to attain\r\nperfect uniformity in different countries and in different periods. Yet\r\nit is believed that the singers of the Roman school, who were subject\r\nto severe penalties for even slight infractions of the traditions of\r\nthe Gregorian procedure, succeeded in preserving through the Middle\r\nAges not only the great body of Gregorian chant but their traditional\r\nperformance with a wonderful degree of purity and inviolability.\r\nBut away from Rome, while the general principles of procedure were\r\npreserved intact, modifications in details undoubtedly crept in, some\r\nunconsciously and some in deference to the various national or local\r\npredilections. Thus in Gaul and the northern countries generally, the\r\noriental style of ornamentation, retained from earlier periods in many\r\nof the Roman melodies, met with scant favor. To satisfy these sturdy\r\nand independent singers the ornate qualities were frequently softened\r\nor eliminated altogether.\r\n\r\nAdditions to the original ritual music of the Gregorian service\r\nappeared about the beginning of the tenth century under the names\r\nof sequences and tropes. The sequence was a melody of hymn-like\r\nstructure which derived its name from its position in the Mass, being a\r\ncontinuation or sequence of the Gradual and Alleluia. It had long been\r\na custom, introduced from the East, to prolong the final vowel of the\r\nAlleluia-chant, sung between the Epistle and the Gospel, into a free\r\nmelody or vocal flourish without words, called jubilation, originally a\r\nkind of ecstatic improvisation. French musicians in the ninth century\r\nadded words to these melodies. They thus became separate compositions\r\nto which at first the name ‘prose’ was given, since the words adapted\r\nto the music were without meter. Later, when these compositions became\r\nthoroughly independent, texts in metrical form were written for them,\r\nthe name ‘prose’ was dropped as no longer appropriate, and the new\r\nname ‘sequence’ assumed. This change in name and character is credited\r\nto the St. Gall monk, Notker Balbulus (died 912). Sequences became\r\nvery popular from the eleventh to the fifteenth centuries and mediæval\r\noffice-books abound in fine specimens, many of them of extreme beauty\r\nand originality. During the tenth and eleventh centuries the monastery\r\nof St. Gall remained the chief centre of activity in the composition\r\nof sequences and Notker found a multitude of followers, mainly in\r\nGermany. Quite independent of the St. Gall influence, a second centre\r\nof activity appeared at the monastery of St. Martial in Limoges,\r\nculminating in the twelfth century in Adam of St. Victor in Paris.\r\nThese sequences, patterned after the Greek model, approached more and\r\nmore the form of the hymn, in which they finally disappeared.\r\n\r\nIn the sequences the vernacular, as well as Latin, was employed\r\nand they were freely used in the Mass, becoming ‘a sort of people’s\r\nsong.’ But since they were in reality extra-liturgical, they were\r\nall suppressed, except five, when the Council of Trent revised the\r\nRoman liturgy in the sixteenth century. The five at present in use\r\nare: _Victimæ Paschali_, appointed for Easter Sunday, written by Wipo\r\nearly in the eleventh century, the oldest of the five and the only one\r\nsimilar in structure to Notker’s sequences; _Veni Sancte Spiritus_\r\nfor Whitsunday, written probably by Innocent III at the end of the\r\ntwelfth century, called ‘the Golden Sequence’ by mediæval writers;\r\n_Lauda Sion_ for the festival Corpus Christi, written by St. Thomas\r\nAquinas supposedly about the year 1261; _Stabat Mater_, sung since\r\n1727 on the Friday in Passion Week, of uncertain authorship; and _Dies\r\nIrae_, sung on All Souls’ Day and in the Requiem or Mass for the Dead,\r\nwritten by Thomas of Celano late in the twelfth century or early in\r\nthe thirteenth century. In the thirteenth century the poetry of the\r\nLatin Church attained its period of greatest brilliance and amid the\r\nrich efflorescence of this wonderful epoch the _Dies Irae_ stands\r\nincomparable, the finest example of rhymed Latin poetry of the Middle\r\nAges. Second to it in poetic beauty is the _Stabat Mater_. It should be\r\nadded that the authors of the above sequences were combined poets and\r\ncomposers, as poetry and music were twin-born arts during the Middle\r\nAges.\r\n\r\nAnother of the many illustrations of the readiness with which the\r\nchurches of the West accepted the musical practices of the East was\r\nthe ‘trope,’ which was adopted among the Franks in the ninth and\r\ntenth centuries from the many Byzantine musicians who came into the\r\nWest during this period. The trope was not unlike the sequence in its\r\ndevelopment. The name was originally given to any succession of tones\r\nwithout text that occurred in the florid chants. Tuotilo of St. Gall\r\n(died 915) developed the tropes into quasi-independent compositions\r\nby setting words to them and interpolating them among the chants\r\nof the Mass, thus thrusting them into the Gregorian liturgy. These\r\ninterpolations, some very extensive and ornate, found their way into\r\nall the Mass-chants except the Credo, which was considered too sacred\r\nto violate. But since the tropes were regarded by the Council of Trent\r\nas weakening accretions to the venerable structure of church-music,\r\nthey, as well as the sequences, were banished from the liturgy in its\r\nfinal revision.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                   III\r\n\r\nThe tendency of ecclesiasticism has always been to curb and discourage\r\nindividual effort toward progress in all matters pertaining to the\r\ndevelopment of ritual-music. This was not altogether strange, for\r\nuntil modern times music existed in the church solely for liturgical\r\npurposes. It was not desired that its effectiveness should be\r\nconsidered apart from the religious idea with which it was so\r\nintimately associated in the liturgy. So completely were text and music\r\nmerged into one artistic unity that the church authorities consistently\r\nand persistently resented any effort to glorify music for its own\r\nsake or at the expense of the liturgic idea. The state of immobility\r\nin which ritual music existed was the natural sequence to the church\r\ndoctrine of immutability. Notwithstanding constant temptation to\r\nexperiment and introduce innovations, the efforts of the Roman singers\r\nwere rigidly restricted to the problems of perfecting the performance\r\nof the ritual music as prescribed by church law and tradition. From\r\nthe standpoint of the liturgy (from which standpoint alone this music\r\nshould be judged) the Roman singers must have attained a standard of\r\nideal perfection in beauty and expressiveness of tonal utterance, and\r\nin preserving the original liturgical significance of the music in the\r\nservice.\r\n\r\nSo conservative was Rome and so fettered was Italy by the venerated\r\ntraditions of the Papal Chapel that no change in musical methods was\r\npossible in this field. Outside of Italy, however, conditions were\r\nmore favorable to progress. In the triumphant march of Christianity\r\nover Western Europe under the leadership of Rome many concessions were\r\nmade to local customs and usages. The independent northerners steadily\r\nrefused to accept with unquestioning allegiance the traditions of\r\nRome in all matters pertaining to ritual-music, and thus stagnation\r\nwas prevented and the hope of further progress for music in time\r\nbecame a reality. Out of the experiments and occasional innovations of\r\nthe venturesome singers of the northern countries there were slowly\r\nand laboriously laid the foundations on which it became possible to\r\nconstruct the succeeding system of ecclesiastical polyphonic music.\r\nBut when, in the fullness of time and with infinite patience and toil,\r\nthis stately edifice was reared, how appropriate and fitting it was\r\nthat the Roman Palestrina, himself associated for many years with\r\nthe Sistine Chapel, should have been the one to lay on its altar the\r\nrichest treasures of religious music that the Roman Church possesses,\r\nthe purest, most complete and perfect expression of the spirit of the\r\nRoman liturgy!\r\n\r\nBefore the Carlovingian era the practice of music was restricted to\r\nthe singing schools founded for the preservation and propagation of\r\nGregorian chant. But with the great impetus given to learning under\r\nCharlemagne the consideration of liturgic music passed to the monastery\r\nstudy. Music became a compulsory subject in the curriculum of the\r\ncathedral and monastery schools, and its theory as well as its practice\r\nreceived the attention of the learned monks and scholars. It was from\r\nthis direction that the next recorded advances in musical art appeared.\r\n\r\nIn the writings of these ecclesiastical musicians and scholars we\r\nfind accounts of the clumsy, yet persistent efforts of the singers\r\nand theorists to break away from the prevailing monophony or unison\r\nchanting of Gregorian music and to improve upon current systems of\r\nnotation. The Flemish monk Hucbald (who died about 930), in his _Musica\r\nenchiriadis_, described the earliest known efforts at polyphony,\r\nwhich he called Organum or Diaphony (See Vol. I, pp. 161 ff). Guido\r\nd’Arezzo (died about 1050), sometimes called ‘the father of music’\r\nand undoubtedly the most impressive musical personality in the early\r\npart of the Middle Ages, probably originated the four-lined staff for\r\nindicating pitch relationships and invented solmization, a system of\r\nreading music through the association of tones with syllables that is\r\nthe direct ancestor of our present-day systems of reading music by\r\nsyllables (‘Tonic Sol-fa,’ ‘Movable Do,’ ‘Fixed Do’). He is credited\r\nby later writers with many innovations and discoveries which possibly\r\nbelonged rightfully to talented and ingenious contemporaries who,\r\nhowever, did not succeed in stamping themselves on their own age\r\nas vividly as did this great singer and teacher. Franco of Cologne\r\n(died about 1200), in his famous treatise on Measured Music, gives a\r\nvoluminous account of his own and contemporary thought about intervals,\r\nconsonances and dissonances, time-values of notes, etc.\r\n\r\nBy the beginning of the thirteenth century the science of music had\r\nreached the point where music could be accurately notated as regards\r\nboth pitch and time relationships and its further development became\r\ncorrespondingly accelerated. The organization of music on the twofold\r\nbasis of regularity of stress or accent and of fixed proportions in the\r\ndivision of time-units was hastened by the growing desire of singers\r\nto add a new voice-part to the old Gregorian chant. This practice of\r\npart-singing, at first called ‘organum,’ later ‘discant,’ undoubtedly\r\nhad its origin in the study-rooms of the choirs and singing schools.\r\nThe choristers were naturally chosen because of their unusual aptitude\r\nfor music. The larger part of their time was given up not only to the\r\nperfecting of means for the most effective performance of the church\r\nmusic, but also to the study of the theory and practice of music\r\nin all its then known phases. The creative instinct more and more\r\nseized upon them. Notwithstanding ecclesiastical restrictions the\r\nsingers were too much under the seductive spell of the inner spirit\r\nof their art not to yield to the ready temptation of delving into the\r\ninfinite possibilities of new tonal combinations and devices that lay\r\nso close at hand. When the idea of singing two melodies at the same\r\ntime was once grasped (we have no definite knowledge how it was first\r\nsuggested), the singers took it up with avidity.\r\n\r\nAt first experiments were restricted to two voices or parts. While\r\none chorister was singing a familiar chant-melody another would sing\r\na second melody an octave or a fourth or a fifth below it, usually\r\njoining it at the end in unison. The progression of two voices or parts\r\nmoving in parallel octaves was known to the Greeks and was called by\r\nthem ‘magadizing’--from the magadis, a stringed instrument. The singing\r\nof two concurrent parts in parallel fourths or fifths did not offend\r\nmediæval ears as it does modern ears, probably because of the exact\r\nparallelism of such melodic movement, which is merely a different kind\r\nof unison.[5] The earliest parallel movement was evidently in fourths,\r\nnot in fifths, as usually stated in musical histories. (See Weinmann,\r\n‘History of Church Music,’ page 74.)\r\n\r\nVarious kinds of organum soon came into vogue. Three-part organum\r\nresulted from doubling the lower of the two parts an octave higher, and\r\nfour-part organum from adding to these three parts the original upper\r\npart an octave lower, thus producing simultaneously moving octaves,\r\nfourths, and fifths. Such a progression of parts, quite obnoxious\r\nto ears accustomed to harmony, impressed Hucbald as ‘a delightful\r\nconcord.’[6] As the experiments increased, the accompanying voice\r\n(the discant) was added above as well as below the chant (the _cantus\r\nfirmus_, or fixed voice). The monotony of exclusive parallelism was\r\nbroken by sometimes sustaining the same tone in one part while the\r\nother part moved up or down (oblique motion) or by letting the two\r\nparts move in contrary direction, and lastly, by mixing these three\r\nkinds of tone movement, thus producing greater variety in the intervals\r\nused. When this freer movement of parts was recognized as essential to\r\nmore pleasing vocal effects, the word discant came to be applied to it\r\nto distinguish it from the more primitive form of movement--organum--in\r\nparallel fourths, fifths, and octaves. Until the thirteenth century the\r\nintervals most used in all styles of part-writing were fourths, fifths,\r\noctaves, and unisons. Thirds and sixths, though occasionally permitted,\r\nwere regarded as dissonances until the period when harmony came to be a\r\nconscious element of musical thought.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: The Playing Angels]\r\n_Altar piece by Hubert and Jan van Eyck_\r\n\r\n\r\nUntil a definite system of notation was devised, the discanting parts\r\nto the chants were extemporized by the singers. But when the staff was\r\ninvented and notes or points were employed to indicate the exact pitch\r\nof the tones of the melodies, the name counterpoint (_punctus contra\r\npunctum_, note against note) was given to the part or parts added to\r\nthe chant (_cantus firmus_). The term counterpoint[7] displaced discant\r\nin the thirteenth century, and from this time the art of counterpoint\r\ndeveloped as the number of added parts increased and the various kinds\r\nof intervallic relationships among the interdependent parts were\r\nrecognized and systematized.\r\n\r\nThe foundation of all the art-music of the Middle Ages was the chant;\r\nand the science of music concerned itself wholly with the addition of\r\nmore or less free and independent parts to the chant-melodies. Musical\r\ninvention, however, was limited entirely to these accompanying parts.\r\nUntil probably the fourteenth century or even later, composers as such\r\nwere unknown. Since music in the church was never considered apart\r\nfrom the liturgy to which it was wedded, not only did the melodic\r\nform of the chants themselves (that is, their rising and falling\r\ninflections of pitch) follow quite closely the natural rhetorical\r\nutterance of the words of the liturgy, being an intensification of the\r\nnatural values of forceful speech, but for several centuries after\r\nthe principle of polyphony was thoroughly recognized the intricate\r\nchurch compositions, such as the masses and motets, were constructed\r\nby using the liturgic chants as subjects and adding free parts to\r\nthese. At first the principal melody (subject) was taken from the\r\nchant books; but in course of time secular songs of the day found\r\ntheir way into the choral parts, either as the principal melody to\r\nwhich other parts were supplied or as an accompanying part to a given\r\nplain-song melody. The secular words, frequently of questionable moral\r\nquality, were often carried along with the melodies into the sacred\r\ncompany of actual ritual-music and the singers found such a combination\r\nneither irreverent nor incongruous. It was quite analogous to the\r\ncustom, common among the early painters, of painting the portraits of\r\nsuch ordinary mortals as wealthy purchasers or patrons on the same\r\ncanvas with saints or apostles, or even with the Madonna. The church\r\nauthorities frowned upon mingling secular and sacred elements in\r\necclesiastical music in this manner, and the practice, so common in the\r\nfourteenth and fifteenth centuries, led to such gross abuses that it\r\nwas finally suppressed.\r\n\r\nThe important rôle which the church singers themselves played in the\r\ndevelopment of music in this formative period is worthy of passing\r\nnotice. Foremost in importance is to be noted that the choirs were\r\nin fact training-schools for composers. Almost without exception the\r\nchurch composers were graduated, so to speak, from the choirs into\r\nthe more exalted and distinguished sphere of creative work, having\r\nfirst gained their practical training and experience as choristers.\r\nBut the humbler singers themselves were not without a good measure\r\nof influence. In their experiments in the study-rooms, as well as in\r\nthe actual singing of written compositions, they served to counteract\r\nthe pedantic rules of theorists by following the dictates of the\r\near as against mere rule. Thus chromatic tones not indicated in the\r\nscore were frequently sung by the experienced choristers who followed\r\ntheir natural musical feeling, and later theory sanctioned what they\r\nintuitively felt. In this way natural musical impulse (which Wagner\r\nhas so beautifully symbolized in Walther in _Die Meistersinger von\r\nNürnberg_) many times softened the austerity and harshness of musical\r\npractices dictated by mediæval theory.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                   IV\r\n\r\nWhile, under the guidance of scholasticism, the stream of church song\r\nwas thus gradually gaining artistic momentum and expressive beauty\r\nand power through the upbuilding of a complicated science of melodic\r\ninterweaving, a second stream of song, unfettered by rule or tradition,\r\nwas modestly and quietly flowing along, gushing from the hearts of\r\nthe people and fed from secular emotions and experiences. Until\r\nthe humanistic movement in the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries\r\ndiscovered points of contact and mutual interdependence, these two\r\nstreams of religious and secular song seldom touched in their onward\r\nflow, for they sprang from widely divergent sources and were guided\r\nby widely differing principles of artistic utterance. In the history\r\nof Western Europe ecclesiastical music has exercised a remarkably\r\nsmall and disproportionate influence on the nature and development of\r\nsecular music; on the contrary, it has frequently weakened and changed\r\nits own standards under the impact of secular ideals and styles. Many\r\nfolk-songs doubtless imitated melodic and modal characteristics of\r\nthe chant-melodies, but there has always existed a certain antipathy\r\nbetween these two forms. The early indifference of the popular mind\r\nto church music is easily traceable to the facts that this music was\r\ncultivated exclusively by ecclesiastics, that it was sung in Latin, a\r\nlanguage which the people neither understood nor cared for, and that\r\nthe people had no part in church song outside the few non-liturgical\r\nhymns.\r\n\r\nThe discussion of secular music in the Middle Ages is necessarily\r\nbeset with difficulties of large proportions, since very few authentic\r\nexamples of folk-melodies of this period have been preserved. Musical\r\nlearning was confined almost exclusively to monks and ecclesiastics who\r\nhad no real interest in the preservation of these wild-flower products.\r\nThose that were pressed into service as parts of polyphonic church\r\nmusic undoubtedly underwent melodic and rhythmic alterations to suit\r\ntheir new environment. In all of them words and music were twin-born;\r\nbut, while many of the beautiful mediæval and earlier poems are extant,\r\ntheir melodies seem to be irretrievably lost.[8]\r\n\r\nThe secular music of the Middle Ages had no direct or immediate\r\nbearing on the development of musical art, but the courtly troubadours\r\nand minnesingers and, later, the mastersingers of humbler origin,\r\nserved to keep alive the practice of solo singing with instrumental\r\naccompaniment and thus maintained the idea of individual expression\r\nwhich had been banished from the church in the early centuries. The\r\nfirst outburst of popular song that attained the significance of a\r\ndistinct movement occurred in southeastern France among the nobles\r\nof sunny, contented, and cheerful Provence. These troubadours, who\r\nflourished throughout southern France, Italy, and Spain from about 1100\r\nto 1300, were concerned largely with the deeds of chivalry, especially\r\nthat phase of the idea of knightliness that glorified the love of some\r\nbeautiful or good woman as the inspiration of, or the reward for,\r\ndeeds of adventure or valor. In the intense feeling and strong lyric\r\nimpulse of these courtly poet-singers is to be found the beginning of\r\nthe modern art of lyric poetry. They showed great ingenuity in the\r\ninvention and elaboration of verse-forms[9] and coupled with this gift\r\nwas a musical inventiveness of marked power which in time developed a\r\nstyle quite divorced from the influence of plain-song. The melodies,\r\nfollowing the rhythmical swing of the verse, frequently approximated\r\nthe structure and feeling of the modern phrase and phrase-group. The\r\ndevelopment of this feeling for the organization of melodic units later\r\nled to most important results when the secular impulse seized upon the\r\nperfected methods of scholastic music.\r\n\r\nIn the north of France and in England the trouvères (both ‘trouvère’\r\nand ‘troubadour’ mean ‘an inventor or finder’) followed close upon\r\nthe troubadours, whom they freely imitated both in style and poetic\r\nthemes. In their artistic activities, however, they were more closely\r\nassociated with ecclesiastical poets and musicians than were the\r\ntroubadours, there was less divergence from the church style in their\r\nmelodies, and hence their efforts entered more directly as a shaping\r\nforce in the succeeding epoch of musical development in Flanders and\r\nEngland. They were also more frequently of humble origin than were\r\nthe troubadours. Adam de la Hále (about 1230 to 1287), probably the\r\nmost conspicuously gifted in the long line of worthy trouvères, was of\r\nhumble birth, the son of a well-to-do burgher of Arras, in Picardy. He\r\nwas a master of the _chanson_, sixteen of which are preserved written\r\nin three parts and in rondeau form. These are among the oldest known\r\nexamples of secular compositions in more than two parts. In the same\r\nmanuscript with these _chansons_ are preserved six Latin motets in\r\nflorid counterpoint. His name looms large in musical history, however,\r\nfrom the fact that his dramatic pastoral play called _Le jeu de Robin\r\net Marion_ (written for the French court at Naples, where the first\r\nperformance was given in 1285) is the earliest example of what we now\r\ncall comic opera. It is written in dialogue and grouped into scenes;\r\nairs, couplets, and pieces for two voices singing in alternation but\r\nnever together are scattered through the play, during the performance\r\nof which eleven personages appear. This quaint song-play, which is a\r\ndevelopment or expansion of the earlier _pastourelle_, was given in\r\nArras in 1896 during the festival in commemoration of the composer.\r\nAdam’s task seems, however, to have been little more than that of a\r\ncompiler, since the most of the songs were not of his own composition.\r\nNevertheless he is altogether one of the most interesting personalities\r\nin the pre-Netherland period.\r\n\r\nParallel with the impulse given to secular song and poetry by the\r\ntroubadours and trouvères, but beginning a little later, was the growth\r\nof the minnesingers, or love-singers, of Germany. This movement,\r\nextending through the twelfth and thirteenth centuries, was limited\r\nalmost exclusively to men of noble birth and aristocratic rank and was\r\nassociated with the pomp of courtly life. Its influence on the general\r\ntrend of musical development was, therefore, less marked than that of\r\nthe corresponding movement in France, particularly in northern France.\r\nRelatively fewer of the minnesongs reached or impressed the popular\r\near, because of the greater exclusiveness of the minnesingers and\r\nthe less pleasing outlines of their melodies, especially the earlier\r\nones. The range of their themes was wider than that of their French\r\ncontemporaries, including nature, qualities of character, patriotism,\r\nand piety, as well as love and chivalrous deeds. The minnesongs on the\r\nwhole display more seriousness than is found in the songs of France,\r\nprimary emphasis always being given to the words. At first modelled\r\nafter the declamatory style of Gregorian chant, their melodies lacked\r\nthe easy flow of the troubadour songs, but the later ones are marked\r\nby strongly modern feeling for rhythm, phrase structure, and definite\r\nkey, and display the delightful naïveté of the German folk-song. Many\r\nof them undoubtedly passed into folk-melodies and from thence into the\r\nchorale literature of the German Reformation period.\r\n\r\nThe mastersingers followed in the wake of the declining minnesingers.\r\nDrawn entirely from the burgher or artisan classes and organizing\r\nthemselves into guilds after the manner of the contemporary\r\ntrades-union, they strove to imitate the methods of their aristocratic\r\nforerunners, without, however, sharing their artistic and lyric\r\nendowments. At a time when their social and economic superiors were\r\nentirely engrossed in the political and religious turmoils of the\r\ntimes, they succeeded in keeping alive a real love for music in the\r\nhearts of the common people and in preserving a wholesome reverence\r\nfor the dignity and worth of the art. Aside from this important\r\nfunction, they did nothing directly to advance the art of music. In\r\n_Die Meistersinger von Nürnberg_ Wagner gives an historically accurate\r\npicture of their hopelessly pedantic methods and reactionary spirit,\r\nwhich were indeed far removed from the nature of real folk-music. The\r\nvast bulk of their melodies were weak imitations of church chants or\r\npopular folk-songs. At long intervals a mastersinger such as Hans\r\nSachs, the quaint and lovable cobbler of Nuremberg (1494-1576), would\r\nmanifest a spark of real lyric genius. The first guild is supposed to\r\nhave been established at Mayence on the Rhine in 1311 by Heinrich von\r\nMeissen, called Frauenlob, himself a distinguished minnesinger, the\r\nlast of that order. The guilds multiplied and were especially active\r\nfrom the fourteenth to the sixteenth century. After 1600 the movement\r\nlost its significance and the guilds dropped by the wayside one by one,\r\nthough a few lingered on until the nineteenth century, the last one\r\nhaving been disbanded at Ulm in 1839.\r\n\r\nThe special historical significance of the troubadours, trouvères,\r\nand minnesingers is to be found in the fact that these secular\r\npoet-musicians of both high and low degree composed their melodies\r\nunder the impulsion of natural, spontaneous musical feeling rather\r\nthan prescribed theoretical law. If they followed the feeling for\r\nchurch modes at all, this feeling instinctively led them to construct\r\ntheir melodies more and more in those modes corresponding to our\r\nmodern major and minor scales. Naumann, in his ‘History of Music,’[10]\r\ngives a number of these melodies in full. One of them, _L’autrier par\r\nla matinée_, by Thibaut, King of Navarre (1201-1253), a celebrated\r\ntroubadour, moves entirely in the key of G major. Another is ‘The\r\nLoveliness of Woman’ (_Tritt ein reines Weib daher_), a proverb[11]\r\nby the minnesinger Spervogel, dating from the middle of the twelfth\r\ncentury, a refined melody clearly in the key of D major, employing\r\nevery tone of the scale. A third, ‘Broken Faith,’ a beautiful and\r\ntouching minnesong by Prince Witzlav, is modern enough in key feeling\r\nand melodic structure to have flowed from the pen of Schubert. In all\r\nof those quoted the phrases are clearly outlined, a sense of design and\r\nmelodic cohesion is manifested in the frequent repetition of phrases,\r\nand through them all there breathes the spirit of free lyric invention\r\nthat differentiates them sharply from all existing church models and\r\nmakes them close kin to the developed songs of the eighteenth century\r\nand later. The gradual development of such an untrammelled feeling\r\nfor free melody among the people explains the comparative rapidity\r\nwith which art-music, after its secession from the church modes and\r\necclesiastical methods early in the seventeenth century, developed new\r\nforms and expanded into new paths that led to a popular appreciation\r\nnever before accorded to music.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                   V\r\n\r\nThe secular impulse from whence sprang the simple melodies of\r\nthe minnesingers and troubadours soon found a channel for fuller\r\nexpression in the art-music of the period immediately following the\r\ndecay of chivalrous song. It was inevitable that the tendency toward\r\nsecularization, already strongly developing in the other arts--notably\r\npainting and architecture--should extend to music also. The beneficent\r\nalliance of music and poetry both in the service of the church and\r\nin the less pretentious effusions of the secular poet-musicians of\r\ncourtly estate naturally led thought to a desire that music should be\r\nthe helpful companion of poetry in all her wanderings, in the domain\r\nof secular experiences as well as religious. As soon as the spirit\r\nof polyphony had been firmly established in ecclesiastical music,\r\nthe church composers began to turn their attention to the rapidly\r\nwidening field of secular poetry for material on which to exploit\r\ntheir newly-found contrapuntal skill. The first application of the\r\nprinciples of polyphony to secular art-music manifested itself in\r\nthe French _chanson_ and the Italian _frottola_. Both of these were\r\nmerely popular melodies brought within the domain of the contrapuntal\r\nprinciple. The _frottola_ seems to have been always set for four voices\r\nin very simple movement, the _chanson_ for either three or four voices.\r\nThese two forms soon merged into the madrigal, which expanded its scope\r\nso as to include almost any lyric composition of delicate texture\r\ndealing with thoughts of rustic humor, sentiment, or passion, couched\r\nin the language of everyday life. The madrigal in time developed into\r\na special department of composition, having a brilliant history of\r\nits own and engaging the interested attention of nearly every noted\r\ncomposer from the fourteenth to the sixteenth century. The word, whose\r\nderivation is hopelessly entangled in a maze of disputed sources,\r\nappears as early at least as the fourteenth century in connection with\r\npastoral or rustic poems of amorous character, and very naturally the\r\nname was soon transferred to the music to which the words were set.\r\n\r\nFew madrigals whose composition antedate the invention of printing\r\nhave been preserved. But all authorities agree that even in its earlier\r\nstages it was composed for three or more voices in the prevailing\r\nchurch modes. Throughout its best period, which closed practically\r\nwith the sixteenth century, it maintained the characteristic of\r\nbeing sung without instrumental accompaniment of any kind.[12] The\r\nassociation of concurrent parts with plain-song undoubtedly suggested\r\nsimilar treatment for secular melodies, and the troubadours and\r\ntrouvères were probably the first to put this suggestion into practice.\r\nBut they passed out of existence before the art of discant had\r\nprogressed beyond its first stage of infancy and further development\r\nof polyphonic secular music was left in the more skilled hands of\r\nthe scientifically trained musicians of the church. The madrigal, or\r\nmore strictly speaking its predecessors, was forthwith adopted by the\r\nchurch composers, who treated it with much tenderness and lavished\r\non it all the learning and technical skill they could command. Since\r\nthese composers, however, were so thoroughly imbued by training and\r\nexperience with the characteristics and idioms of church music, we find\r\nno essential differences, as far as the music is concerned, between the\r\nmadrigal and its ecclesiastical counterpart, the motet (see Chapter\r\nII). These two forms have maintained an almost exact correspondence\r\nwith each other in each successive stage of their musical development.\r\nThe only real difference lay in the nature of the words employed, those\r\nof the madrigal being always secular, those of the motet, sacred. While\r\nthe madrigal was just as polyphonic as the motet and followed the same\r\ngeneral laws of musical construction, it was in lighter vein and in\r\nsimpler style to suit the secular spirit of the words. The ponderous\r\nand solemn character of the motet was avoided, the contrapuntal parts\r\nbecame more plastic and expressive in conformity with the sentiment of\r\nthe words. These freer and more expressive qualities in the madrigal\r\nwere eagerly seized upon by the dramatic composers of the seventeenth\r\ncentury, during which period the madrigal was a regular feature of the\r\nopera. Dr. Stainer enumerates the following essential qualities of the\r\ntrue madrigal: themes suitable in character to the words, variety of\r\nrhythm, short melodic phrases, imitation and counterpoint.\r\n\r\nThe original home of the true madrigal is undoubtedly Flanders. It is\r\nmentioned here as early as the first part of the fifteenth century,\r\nwhen it was already a well established form of polyphonic writing\r\npopular with both Flemish and Netherland composers. It was regarded by\r\nthem as second only in importance to the mass and motet. In a period\r\nwhen the musical leadership of Europe was located in the Low Countries,\r\nits cultivation by these learned masters insured its transmission to\r\nother countries and, more important still to the development of musical\r\nart, marked the first practical alliance of popular song and science.\r\nThe offspring of this union was destined to achieve important results\r\nin the art-revolution of the seventeenth century.\r\n\r\nAny narrative of early secular music would be peculiarly incomplete\r\nwithout extended mention of the oldest example of secular polyphonic\r\nmusic known to exist, the famous English canon or round, ‘Sumer is\r\nicumen in,’ an ancient manuscript copy of which is among the richest\r\ntreasures of the British Museum. The first mention of this celebrated\r\npiece, hidden away in the Harleian collection of manuscripts, was\r\nmade in the first decade of the eighteenth century. Until the middle\r\nof the nineteenth century the date of the manuscript was assigned to\r\nthe fifteenth century. But after most minute and laborious research,\r\nthe English historian, William Chappell, discovered internal evidence\r\n(which succeeding investigators have accepted) to prove that this\r\nvenerable manuscript was written between 1226 and 1240 at the abbey of\r\nReading in Berkshire by a monk named John of Fornsete. The manuscript\r\nis, of course, the work of a copyist; no clew has been found to the\r\ncomposer’s name.\r\n\r\nThe rustic character of the words would seem to ally it to the\r\nmadrigal, but its musical form is that of the rota or round, very\r\ndifferent from the free structure of the madrigal. In the manuscript\r\nare also Latin words addressed to the Virgin, indicating its occasional\r\nuse for worship purposes. The old English words are as follows:\r\n\r\n      ‘Sumer is icumen in, Lhude sing cuccu;\r\n      Groweth sed and bloweth med, And springth the wode nu;\r\n      Awe bleteth after lomb, Lhouth after calve cu;\r\n      Bulluc sterteth, bucke verteth, Murie sing cuccu.\r\n        Wel singes thu cuccu; Ne swik thu naver nu.’\r\n\r\nThe Latin directions on the manuscript for singing the round indicate\r\nthat the theme is to be sung in exact imitation by four voices of\r\nequal compass which enter, each four measures after the preceding one.\r\nAccompanying this strict four-part canon throughout are two additional\r\nparts, called a ‘pes’ or ground-bass. This two-voiced burden consists\r\nof a four-measure group which monotonously repeats itself over and over\r\nagain, the two parts exchanging places in regular alternation.\r\n\r\nThe extreme antiquity of the piece would alone make it an object of\r\nreverent interest, for it is the earliest example of a canon, it is the\r\nfirst recorded use of the ground-bass or _basso ostinato_, and it is\r\nthe only known piece in six real parts before the fifteenth century.\r\nBut the wonder grows when we consider the musical quality of this\r\nremarkable melody of unknown parentage, ‘born out of due season.’ It is\r\nsweet and joyous in character, fitting the pastoral mood of the words;\r\nit flows along in graceful outline with a wonderful amount of melodic\r\nvariety; it maintains an easy rhythmic swing in definite three-pulse\r\nmeasure; it has an unmistakably modern feeling for key--the key of F\r\nmajor--made all the more definite by clearly defined tonic and dominant\r\nharmonies which pulsate back and forth in alternate measures. In\r\nmusical feeling and expression it is ‘immeasurably in advance of any\r\npolyphonic music of earlier date than the Fa-las peculiar to the later\r\ndecades of the sixteenth century’ (Rockstro). Its formal structure\r\ndisplays full knowledge of the contrapuntal devices of the times and\r\nalso remarkable freedom in handling them.\r\n\r\nThe apparition of this warm-blooded melody amid the arid scholasticism\r\nof the thirteenth century seems utterly incongruous. Yet Rockstro’s\r\nexplanation[13] seems plausible enough. He points out that some\r\nfolk-songs of greatest antiquity possess the same qualities of\r\ningenious grace that shine so resplendently in this melody. The words\r\nare evidently Northumbrian; what could be more natural than that some\r\ntrained monkish ear caught the melody and words as they fell from the\r\nuntutored but inspired lips of some north-countryman, rubbed off a\r\nrough place here and there, detected its adaptability for use as a\r\n‘round’ theme (a quality quite common in folk-songs), and worked it out\r\nwith his clerical companions in extempore fashion after the custom of\r\nthe times?\r\n\r\nThe inference is irresistible that such a fragrant folk-song, if this\r\nbe a folk-song, could not have existed as an isolated specimen. The few\r\nmelodies of undoubted antiquity we possess demonstrate the presence of\r\nunrecognized Schuberts and Mozarts, geniuses ‘born to blush unseen,’\r\namong the humble but inspired singers even of those far-off centuries.\r\nThe devout and sincere monks who laid the formal foundations of the\r\nart of music were too much under the thraldom of authority and theory\r\nto perceive the spirit, or recognize the invaluable aid, of such free,\r\nspontaneous song in working out the problems they set themselves to\r\nsolve. In many respects it was a real misfortune and a hindrance in\r\nthe development of art-music that more of its early steps of progress\r\ncould not have been taken under the stimulating influence of the\r\nfolk-song, instead of exclusively under the influence and guidance of\r\necclesiasticism and the strict and deadening formalism of the early\r\nchurch. The oft-repeated argument that it was necessary to evolve\r\ncomplex musical forms before expressive musical utterance could exist,\r\nfalls to the ground, shattered by a single phrase of this inspired\r\nNorthumbrian lay. It would scarcely be maintained that the manufacture\r\nof carriages preceded the creation of man or that man acquired an\r\nextensive vocabulary before he became conscious of ideas surging within\r\nhim for utterance.\r\n\r\nThe religious thought of the monk-musicians of the early centuries was\r\ncentred on forms and externals, and the character of their religious\r\nthought dominated all their mental activities. They were not ready to\r\nbe led by ‘a little child’; they had no ears attuned to the ‘still,\r\nsmall voice’ of free-born, inspired song. The free spirit of the song,\r\nwhich even in remotest periods insisted on choosing its own appropriate\r\nform, did not find real lodgment in art-music until the Romanticism\r\nof the nineteenth century conclusively demonstrated the inalienable\r\nright of every musical thought to determine the nature of the musical\r\nform through which it should be expressed, unfettered by tradition\r\nor theoretical law. The growth of this principle of emancipation in\r\nmusic has kept pace through all the centuries with the growth of the\r\nsame spirit of freedom in the individual consciousness of man. At the\r\nbeginning of the twentieth century we are for the first time in the\r\nhistory of musical art beginning to breathe in an atmosphere of full\r\nfreedom in respect to the relation of musical thought to musical form.\r\nIf wild extravagances have occasionally resulted from the realization\r\nof this full freedom, they are possibly the inevitable consequences\r\nof a youthful overjoy at kicking loose from the old harness of\r\nstereotyped forms--an exuberance of feeling that the present period of\r\nnecessary readjustment and orientation will temper and direct into real\r\nconstructive channels.\r\n\r\n\r\n                              FOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[1] Especially Gevaert, _La Mélopée antique dans le Chant de l’Église\r\nlatine_.\r\n\r\n[2] The name ‘Sistine Chapel’ was not given to this organization until\r\nthe Pontificate of Sixtus IV (1471-1484); it was derived from the\r\n_Cappella Sistina_ built by this pope.\r\n\r\n[3] Practically all the music of these ancient collections has been\r\nlost, excepting the Spanish or Mozarabic or Visigothic. Recent\r\ndiscoveries have disclosed a considerable portion of the music of\r\nthis branch of the Church, so that we have some definite information\r\nconcerning at least three ancient ecclesiastical dialects of\r\nritual-music--the Gregorian, the Ambrosian, and the Visigothic or\r\nMozarabic. In a few Spanish churches the Mozarabic rites and music\r\nstill survive.\r\n\r\n[4] Pope Paul in 760 sent copies of the _Antiphonarium_ and\r\n_Responsoriale_ to King Pepin.\r\n\r\n[5] Alert teachers of ear-training have frequently observed that\r\ncertain students will sing tones given them by dictation a fifth above\r\nor below the given tone under the impression that they are singing in\r\nunison with it. (See also Parry, ‘The Evolution of the Art of Music,’\r\nChap. 4.)\r\n\r\n[6] Such an expression of pleasure can be explained only when it is\r\nremembered that the monastic mind was thoroughly accustomed to being\r\nabsolutely submissive to authority. Mediæval ecclesiastical authority\r\ndictated what was good or bad in musical theory and procedure, just as\r\nit did in the realms of morals, ethics, and religion; and authority\r\ndecreed that only perfect intervals--fourths, fifths, and octaves--were\r\nusable, therefore they were pleasing. It took several centuries of the\r\nactual ‘practice’ of music to overcome the ban placed by ‘theory’ on\r\nthe interval of the third in certain cadences.\r\n\r\n[7] The development of the technical material of composition,\r\nimitation, canon, fugue, etc., is fully described in Vol. I.\r\n\r\n[8] The melody of the celebrated ‘Lament’ over the death of\r\nCharlemagne, composed in 814 and sung by both Franks and Germans, is\r\nfortunately preserved to us. This remarkable melody (quoted by Naumann\r\nin his ‘History of Music,’ Vol. I, p. 199) has a compass of practically\r\nonly three tones, yet in its simple outlines there is eloquent and\r\ndignified expression of the popular love for the great emperor. The\r\nmelody of the more famous ‘Roland’s Song,’ also of Charlemagne’s\r\ntime, has not survived, although it was sung as late as the battle of\r\nPoictiers in 1356.\r\n\r\n[9] Among the favorite forms were the _canzonet_ or _chanson_, a\r\nlove-song addressed to some courtly dame, the _serenade_ or evening\r\nsong, the _aubade_ or day song, the _servante_, extolling the virtues\r\nof some prince, the _tenzone_ or dialogue song, the _roundelay_, with\r\nthe same refrain repeated again and again, and the _pastourelle_,\r\ndescriptive of ‘Arcadian love in idyllic nature.’\r\n\r\n[10] Chap. 8 of Vol. I is devoted to an unusually full and illuminating\r\ndiscussion of the whole secular song movement of this period.\r\n\r\n[11] As noted above, the melodies of the minnesongs were from the\r\nbeginning dependent on the metrical and poetical structure of the\r\nstrophe. The three principal kinds are the song (_Lied_), the lay\r\n(_Lerch_), and the proverb (_Spruch_).\r\n\r\n[12] The word madrigal was used at various periods to apply to two\r\nother forms in addition to the one here described: (1) the solo\r\nmadrigal or _madrigale concertate con il basso continuo_, and (2) the\r\nmadrigal with accompaniment for several instruments, ‘apt for viols and\r\nvoyces,’ as the old English song books have it.\r\n\r\n[13] Grove’s ‘Dictionary of Music and Musicians,’ Vol. IV, Art. ‘Sumer\r\nis icumen in.’\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                               CHAPTER II\r\n\r\n                         THE POLYPHONIC PERIOD\r\n\r\n     The Gallo-Belgic School; the Netherlanders; the Mass\r\n     and its liturgical significance; the use of secular\r\n     subjects--Conditions that fostered continuity of development:\r\n     the ‘Mass of Tournay’; Dufay and Okeghem; Hobrecht’s\r\n     _Parce Domine_; Josquin des Prés’ masses and motets; his\r\n     expressive style--The motet as an extra-liturgical form; its\r\n     development; its later characteristic style; distinction\r\n     between sacred and secular music--Orlandus Lassus: his\r\n     ‘Penitential Psalms’; his tendency toward a simpler style;\r\n     his _Gustate et Videte_ and other compositions--Palestrina’s\r\n     reforms, methods, and style; his masses, _Papæ Marcelli_,\r\n     _Brevis_, and _Assumpta est Maria_; his motets and other\r\n     compositions: Vittoria and others--Madrigal writers of the\r\n     sixteenth century: Festa, Arcadelt, Willaert, Byrd, Morley,\r\n     etc.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                   I\r\n\r\nUntil about 1550 practically all art-music in western Europe was\r\nchoral. Though the first important steps in the development of music\r\nwere taken in Italy, devotion to the principles of unison Gregorian\r\nchant kept the polyphonic idea from gaining a foothold there until\r\nthe fourteenth century. As we have seen, vocal counterpoint was the\r\noffspring of northern musicians, and under their care and guidance it\r\ndeveloped into its most complex and perfected form. The first centre of\r\nactivity was Paris, during the twelfth and thirteenth centuries. From\r\nthis point the art was gradually disseminated to the northward and its\r\ndevelopment was continued through the experimentation and theorizing\r\nof the musicians of northern France and Flanders (the Gallo-Belgic\r\nSchool, 1360-1460). After these zealous apprentices had made ready\r\nthe crude tools of composition, there appeared real masters who\r\nstrove earnestly to convert the elaborate technical forms and devices\r\nof vocal counterpoint into vehicles for the expression of musical\r\nfeeling and religious devotion. These masters were the Netherlanders\r\n(from 1400 to 1550), whose mission it was to perfect the forms and\r\nmaterial of musical composition, and, working from the standpoint\r\nof musical science, to compel these forms to serve the expressional\r\npurposes of the art. So well did they accomplish these two ends that\r\nfor nearly two centuries all of western Europe gave musical allegiance\r\nto the Netherlanders and looked to them for teachers, composers, and\r\nchoir leaders. During this period the Low Countries were the musical\r\nheadquarters of Europe.\r\n\r\nIn the first period of polyphony the singers had followed the\r\ninspiration of the moment and certain general rules of intervallic\r\nmovement in improvising their discant to the Gregorian chant. In the\r\nfourteenth century these unsystematic efforts gradually gave way to the\r\ndefinite writing of all the parts to be sung. In the fifteenth century\r\nthe Netherlanders began systematically to develop and perfect the forms\r\ncrudely outlined by their predecessors in the fields of both church and\r\nsecular music. The forms of church choral music that held their chief\r\nattention were masses, motets, psalms, and hymns. Among the secular\r\nforms we find _chansons_ and madrigals. Of all these the mass, with its\r\nseparate parts, was destined to become the form on which the composer\r\nexpended his greatest care and skill and through which he sought to\r\nexpress his noblest thoughts. It was to the Netherland period and to\r\nthe Roman Church composers thereafter what the sonata and the symphony\r\nwere to the composers of the nineteenth century and the decades just\r\npreceding. In such reverence and respect was this form held that in the\r\npreface of a mass published in 1539 by Grapheus in Nuremberg it could\r\nbe confidently asserted, ‘he who is not acquainted with the masses\r\nof the old masters is ignorant of true music.’ The great importance\r\nattached to the mass by composers was inevitable from its commanding\r\nposition in the church service. At this point it may be opportune to\r\ndiscuss some of the essential features of the mass from the standpoint\r\nof the liturgy.\r\n\r\nAmong the several offices of the Roman Catholic Church the mass is\r\nthe most fundamental and solemn--the chief doctrinal cornerstone on\r\nwhich is reared the whole superstructure of Catholic faith and worship.\r\nIt was evolved from the dogma of the eucharist, to which was added at\r\nan early period the Jewish idea of sacrifice, which formed so vital a\r\npart of the old dispensation. Little by little it grew into the fair\r\nproportions of a great religious poem, magnificent in outline and\r\ntexture, and breathing the religious ecstasies of the devout and holy\r\nteachers and leaders and saints of the church. Scriptural lessons,\r\nprayers, hymns, and responses are woven into the liturgic texture, all\r\nbeing brought into harmonious unity under the sway of the controlling\r\nidea of consecration and oblation. To the Roman Catholic the mass is\r\n‘the permanent channel of grace ever kept open between God and his\r\nchurch.’ As often as the eucharistic elements of bread and wine are\r\npresented at the altar with certain prescribed prayers and formulas,\r\nthe atoning sacrifice of Christ is repeated through the miracle of\r\ntransubstantiation, ‘by which the bread and wine are transmuted into\r\nthe very body and blood of Christ.’[14] The following sentences from\r\nCardinal Gibbons’ ‘The Faith of Our Fathers’ make this central dogma\r\nof the Catholic faith still more clear: ‘The sacrifice of the mass is\r\nidentical with that of the cross, both having the same victim and high\r\npriest--Jesus Christ. The only difference consists in the manner of the\r\noblation. Christ was offered upon the cross in a bloody manner; in the\r\nmass he is offered up in an unbloody manner. On the cross he purchased\r\nour ransom, and in the eucharistic sacrifice the price of that ransom\r\nis applied to our souls.’\r\n\r\nThe mass is not the product of any one individual or council or\r\nhierarchical body, but, rather, is a gradual evolution,[15] a growth\r\nfrom the richest and holiest experiences of generations of pious and\r\ndevout priests and monks, whose whole lives were dedicated to the\r\nservice of the Most High and to the upbuilding of his visible kingdom\r\non earth. Furthermore, in the mass the words of the liturgic text are\r\nnot to be dissociated from the musical tones in which they are uttered\r\nby priest or choir. The spirit and meaning of the words so completely\r\nsaturate the musical forms chosen for their expression that word and\r\ntone constitute an indissoluble artistic unit. And, while the aim of\r\nthe church has always been to restrict the function of music in the\r\nservice to a purely secondary place--to keep it in bondage to the\r\nritual--the enormous value of music as an effective reinforcement of\r\nthe poetic text was recognized from the very inception of liturgic\r\nforms.\r\n\r\nIn explaining the potent influence which the ceremonies and rites of\r\nthe Roman Catholic Church have always exerted over the minds of men,\r\nwhether believers in that faith or not, one must take into account the\r\ncomposite character of the appeal that is made. Exalted poetic text and\r\nalluring tone are by no means the only agencies employed. Through every\r\navenue of approach and by means of a multitude of artistic agencies,\r\nthe mind and heart of the worshipper are assailed with the one object\r\nin view to compel undivided attention to, and contemplation of, the\r\nsupreme mysteries of religious faith which the Roman liturgy sets\r\nforth. The solemn magnificence of the ceremonial rites, with gorgeous\r\nvestments and dignified gesture and the grace of swinging censers, is\r\nenhanced by the grandeur of architectural proportions and decorations.\r\nEvery resource of artistic genius that painter can throw upon glowing\r\ncanvas or sculptor can chisel into marble forms is found on wall or\r\nniche or altar. Long before the Florentine reformers stumbled upon\r\nthe principle of the union of all the arts in dramatic representation\r\nand centuries before Wagner gave such insistent reiteration to this\r\nprinciple, the Roman Church had given practical proof of the efficacy\r\nof the perfect union of all the arts as an aid in the expression of\r\nthe religious idea. No one art existed for its own sake, nor did\r\nit measure its effectiveness by the merits and value of its own\r\nindividual impressiveness; but each art borrowed something from its\r\nassociation with the other arts and with the time-honored forms and\r\nthe hallowed memories which their universality and supposed divine\r\nnature always evoked. Thus, as has been frequently pointed out, there\r\nis much ecclesiastical art to which a largely fictitious value has been\r\nattached because of its sacred and revered association.\r\n\r\nBut whatever may be said about the intrinsic artistic ineffectiveness\r\nof much ecclesiastical plastic and pictorial art, no one can deny the\r\ninherent beauty, power, and appropriateness of the music to which the\r\nRoman Catholic liturgy is wedded. Of all the arts that were called into\r\nthe service of the church, music was best suited by its very nature to\r\nrespond to the new ideals of Christianity. The pictorial and plastic\r\narts were used to appeal to eye and imagination as reinforcements to\r\nthe inherent symbolism of ceremonial and ritual. But music, which has\r\nno recourse to symbols or imagery and which has in its vocabulary\r\nno suggestion of the material world outside of man, was far better\r\nequipped, even in the infancy of the art, to lay hold of the essential\r\nspirit of the liturgy and express it in terms that not only acted\r\ndirectly and powerfully on the hearts and minds of the worshippers,\r\nbut threw a glamour and fascination over all its allied agencies of\r\nexpression. The spiritual and emotional appeals of the sublime ideals\r\nof the Gospel struck a note in human consciousness which responded\r\nin an outburst of artistic rapture that was unknown to pre-Christian\r\nperiods, and music, as the freest and least material of the arts, was\r\nthe first to develop a form of expression that was a fitting embodiment\r\nof the indwelling religious motive and idea. So wonderfully did the\r\nancient creators of the religious melodies known as plain-song do their\r\nwork, and so perfectly did they blend word and tone in priestly chant\r\nor choral response, that these melodies have not only been held in\r\nreverence by the church ever since that far-off time, but they are now\r\nthe only musical forms permitted for certain important portions of the\r\nliturgy.\r\n\r\nAlthough the word ‘mass’[16] is, strictly speaking, applicable only\r\nto the eucharistic service in its entirety, it has been used from\r\nthe early centuries of Roman Church history to designate certain\r\nportions of the liturgy to which unusually solemn and impressive music\r\nhas been set. With the growth of counterpoint the opportunities for\r\nincreasing the impressiveness and elaborateness of these settings were\r\nobviously multiplied. The parts of the service which were thus subject\r\nto special musical elaboration were the _Kyrie_, the _Gloria_, the\r\n_Credo_, the _Sanctus_, the _Benedictus_, and the _Agnus Dei_. These\r\nsix movements together comprise what was known as the ‘mass,’ and they\r\nstill constitute, with slight variations, the essential portions in\r\nall musical masses, whether written for church or concert performance.\r\nDuring the period under consideration it was an almost universal custom\r\nto have one subject (_cantus firmus_) do service for all the movements\r\nof a mass, which accordingly took its name from this subject. These\r\nsubjects, particularly in the earlier periods of polyphonic music,\r\nwere plain-song melodies, whence we have such names for masses as\r\n_Missa Iste confessor_, _Missa Tu es Petrus_, and _Missa Veni sponsa\r\nChristi_. But, as has already been mentioned, sacred melodies were\r\nnot the only ones chosen. Composers frequently invaded the domain of\r\npopular song for subjects for their masses. Such ardent love-songs\r\nas _Adieu, mes amours_ (‘Farewell, my love’) and _Baisez-moi_ (‘Kiss\r\nme’) seem strangely out of place in such surroundings, but these and\r\nsimilar names appear in the titles of many a mass of this period. The\r\nmost famous of all the popular songs thus used was the old French\r\nlove-song, _L’homme armé_ (‘The Armed Man’), which nearly every\r\nNetherland master from Dufay[17] to Palestrina wove with infinite skill\r\ninto the texture of at least one mass, Josquin des Prés, indeed, into\r\ntwo. If the composer wished to conceal the source of his subject, for\r\nthe ecclesiastical authorities naturally frowned upon the practice\r\nof using secular melodies, or if he invented an original subject, as\r\nhe occasionally ventured to do, he affixed the title _sine nomine_\r\nto his mass. If it had some uniform peculiarity of construction it\r\nwas called _Missa ad fugam_ or _Missa ad canones_. Sometimes it would\r\ntake its name from the number of voices for which it was written, as\r\n_Missa quatuor vocum_, or from the mode in which it was composed, as\r\n_Missa secundi toni_, or _Missa octavi toni_. Occasionally the subject\r\nwould be constructed upon the six tones of the hexachord and the work\r\nentitled _Missa ut, re, mi, fa, sol, la_; or upon some practice-phrase\r\nfrom the choir-room, as Josquin’s _Missa la, sol, fa, re, mi_.\r\n\r\n                      [Illustration: Music score]\r\n                          _L’homme armé_\r\n\r\nThe Netherlanders have been severely reproached for their frequent use\r\nof non-ecclesiastical subjects for their church compositions, and at\r\nfirst thought such a practice would seem to be entirely indefensible\r\nand reprehensible. The censure was undoubtedly merited when the secular\r\nwords accompanied the folk-melodies in their forced journeys into\r\nsuch sacred regions. It was equally merited in the early periods when\r\nthe meagre art of the discanters possessed so few resources either to\r\nconceal the identity of the secular tune or to expunge its secularity\r\nby rhythmic alterations. The case was quite different, however, with\r\nthe complicated polyphonic structures into which the later masters of\r\nthe ‘new art’ (_ars nova_) injected the secular melodies. With the\r\nearly discanters ‘the _tenor_ (the voice that carried the subject)\r\nformed the foundation of the arches, now it became one of the arches\r\nwhich, united in harmonious structure, formed the bridge.’[18] With the\r\ncontrapuntists the subject itself became more plastic and submitted\r\nto whatever rhythmic changes were desirable in the working out of\r\ntheir contrapuntal purposes; each part became entirely independent\r\nin its melodic and rhythmic movement. In the complex interweavings\r\nof voice-parts the identity of the subject itself became practically\r\nlost. The ear could no longer identify it in performance as a complete\r\nmelody, though the eye could recognize it on the printed page. In\r\nsuch a case the secularity of its origin became a largely negligible\r\nelement, swallowed up by the purely ecclesiastical manner in which\r\nthe subject was handled. In an era when it was not the custom for\r\ncomposers to invent their own subjects, this practice of using merely\r\nthe melodies of secular songs for church compositions was no more\r\ncensurable than the later employment of folk-songs as the basis of many\r\nof the splendid chorales of the German Protestant movement. Moreover,\r\nit must be borne in mind, in justice to the Netherlanders, that during\r\nthis whole period there were no essential differences of style or\r\ntreatment to distinguish secular from sacred compositions.\r\n\r\nBut it should be further noticed that in the relation of text to music\r\nthere is revealed the most glaring weakness of the Netherlanders.\r\nUntil the brilliant close of this period was nearly reached, the text\r\nwas of quite secondary importance. Starting from a basis of theory\r\nand science, counterpoint, in all its evolutionary processes, became\r\nlargely a matter of mathematical calculation in which the sound, not\r\nthe word, governed. So deeply were composers absorbed in working out\r\nthe problems of pure sound-combinations and so little importance\r\ndid they attach to the text that they did not deem it necessary to\r\nwrite down more than the opening word of each movement of the mass,\r\nas _Sanctus_ or _Benedictus_, leaving it to the intelligence of the\r\ntrained singers to fill in the remainder of the familiar texts as they\r\nsaw fit. This laxness in respect to the text invited many abuses,\r\nsuch as the mixing of secular and sacred words, the interpolation of\r\nunauthorized words, the blending of texts from various parts of the\r\nliturgy, to the danger of errors in dogma, which eventually placed the\r\nwhole structure of polyphonic music under the reproach of the church\r\nauthorities.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                   II\r\n\r\nNotwithstanding faults due to the immaturity of the art and a certain\r\nfalse perspective, the church composers of this period displayed,\r\nup to their light, a rare devotion to the one supreme purpose of\r\nenhancing the impressiveness of the religious rites and their liturgic\r\nsignificance, thus making possible a line of unbroken continuity in\r\nthe development of the art of unaccompanied vocal polyphony, which was\r\ndestined to become the peculiar glory of the Netherland era. Trained\r\nin cloisters and choirs, acknowledging the church as their only patron\r\nand master to whose service they dedicated all their powers, these men\r\nwere far removed from worldly affairs and especially protected from\r\nthe distracting and corrupting influences of the savage strife and\r\nturmoil of the times. Every important ecclesiastical establishment\r\nmaintained its own staff of composers, for, until the founding of\r\nmusical publishing houses soon after 1500 made the multiplication\r\nand circulation of musical scores easy, the labor and expense of\r\ncopying the manuscripts prevented any extensive exchange of musical\r\ncompositions among the thousands of ecclesiastical establishments that\r\ndotted western Europe and each establishment was compelled to depend\r\nlargely on its own resources for its more elaborate ritual-music.\r\nFor the most part the ecclesiastical musicians passed their lives in\r\nthe absorbing routine of their official duties, close to the heart\r\nof their religion and living constantly in an atmosphere permeated\r\nwith austere ecclesiastical traditions. Thus the best Catholic music\r\nof the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries, unaffected by the external\r\nconditions and influences that brought weakness and decline to some of\r\nthe other arts, preserved its serene course of development toward its\r\nculminating point in the sublime creations of Palestrina. But before\r\nthis zenith of the second great period of musical art was reached,\r\nthere were two centuries of artistic yearning and searching, a period\r\nthat Parry calls ‘the youth of modern music--a period most pure,\r\nserene, and innocent--when mankind was yet too immature in things\r\nmusical to express itself in terms of passion or of force, but used\r\nforms and moods of art which are like tranquil dreams and communings of\r\nman with his inner self, before the sterner experiences of life have\r\nquite awakened him to its multiform realities and vicissitudes.’[19]\r\n\r\nThe Netherland period was one of quite astonishing musical activity.\r\nThe number of musicians actually engaged in the composition of\r\nritual-music constitutes an imposing array (the names of nearly 400 are\r\nrecorded) and their actual output both in bulk and quality measures\r\nnot at all unworthily with that of the other arts of this period, the\r\nnames of whose masterpieces are household words. That the equally great\r\nmasterpieces of polyphonic vocal art are not familiar, indeed, are\r\nalmost wholly unknown even to musicians, is inevitable from the very\r\nlimitations imposed upon music by the matter of performance, and from\r\nthe inavailability of this music outside its special home--the church.\r\nIts speech was always idiomatic, a kind of developed specialty, and,\r\nfor about two centuries after its culminating point was reached, it\r\nbecame archaic even in the church from whose bosom it sprang, so that\r\nthe avenues to a wide public acquaintance with its peculiar beauties\r\nwere largely closed soon after its greatest masterpieces were written.\r\n\r\nThe masses and motets of the period reflect all the changing phases\r\nof the gradually advancing musical art. They express the deep and\r\nserious things of the art; the madrigals and _chansons_ are the\r\nemanations of the composers’ lighter moments of relaxation, incidental\r\ndeviations from the main course of artistic endeavor, written mostly\r\nfor the entertainment of noble and wealthy patrons. The oldest known\r\nmass is the celebrated ‘Mass of Tournay,’[20] which Coussemaker\r\nascribes to the thirteenth century. It is written in three parts\r\nwith the subject (_cantus_) in the middle; one of the added parts\r\nmoves almost constantly in parallel fourths or fifths with either\r\nthe subject or the third part, while this third part generally has a\r\ncontrary movement to one of the other parts. Historically it forms an\r\ninteresting transitional link between the primitive organum and the\r\ncrude counterpoint of the thirteenth and fourteenth centuries.\r\n\r\nIt is customary for musical historians to distinguish two Netherland\r\nschools. The first was occupied with pioneer work; its music was severe\r\nand unmelodious, simple and unpretentious when compared with that of\r\nthe succeeding school, with only faint attempts to attain euphonic\r\nbeauty; yet earnestness of purpose coupled with much contrapuntal\r\nscience and ingenuity are everywhere in evidence. William Dufay\r\n(1400-1474) was the principal master of this school, although the\r\nmass _Ecce Ancilla_, by Antoine Busnois (1440-1492), is regarded by\r\nNaumann as ‘the most important musical historical monument up to the\r\nyear 1475.’[21] In this period the several movements of the mass\r\nbegan to take on a certain definiteness and individuality of form\r\ncorresponding to the natural subdivisions of the texts, making several\r\nmovements within each movement. Likewise certain modes of treatment\r\ncame to be associated with certain movements. Thus, in the _Agnus Dei_,\r\nwhich was divided into two parts, the composer was expected to employ\r\nthe utmost resources of his contrapuntal skill; the second part was\r\nusually written in canon or in intricate fugue and frequently with a\r\nlarger number of voices than in the other movements of the mass. The\r\n_Benedictus_ came to be regarded as a composition for two, three, or\r\nfour solo voices, usually followed by a choral _Osanna_. And so the\r\nvarious movements gradually assumed quite definite outlines as to form\r\nand character, which remained in force for a century and a half.\r\n\r\nWith Joannes Okeghem (about 1430-1495 or 6) the second Netherland\r\nschool was ushered in. This master, to whom the laudatory title of\r\n‘Prince of Music’ was given, appears to have carried the possibilities\r\nof contrapuntal ingenuity and contrivance to extremest limits.\r\nComparatively few of his works are extant, and most of these display\r\nwonderful technical skill in handling musical problems rather than\r\nattempts at expression. Among those preserved is the famous _Missa\r\ncujusvis toni_ (mass in any tone or mode), which seems to have been\r\ncomposed as an intellectual exercise for the highly trained choristers\r\nof his time, demanding in its rendition perfect mastery of all the\r\nchurch modes and ability to transpose from one mode to another. He was\r\nrather a great teacher and theorist than a great church composer. His\r\npupils carried the art of polyphony into all countries and Kiesewetter\r\nmaintains that through these students he became ‘the founder of all\r\nschools from his own to the present age.’[22] One of the most prominent\r\nof Okeghem’s contemporaries was Jacob Hobrecht or Obrecht (1430-1505 or\r\n6), who was a most devoted disciple and admirer, though not a pupil,\r\nof the learned master. He left many masses, motets, and _chansons_, in\r\nsome of which, notably in the motet _Parce Domine_ for three voices, he\r\nattains a high degree of real expressive power. This fine work exerted\r\na powerful influence on Josquin des Prés and reveals its creator as\r\npossibly the first composer to make polyphony bend to the necessity of\r\nmusical expression as we understand it.\r\n\r\nOkeghem’s most celebrated pupil was Josquin des Prés (about 1450-1521),\r\nwho eclipsed his master’s fame in musical learning and wealth of\r\ningenuity and became the most brilliant exponent of the musical art\r\nof the Netherlanders. He was the most popular composer and celebrated\r\nmusician of his time, the spread of his music as well as his fame being\r\ngreatly aided, no doubt, by the newly-invented process of printing\r\nmusic from movable type, which appeared at the very moment when he\r\nwas at the height of his power. In his best works (he was a most\r\nprolific writer) we can detect a more flowing and emotional style and\r\ncatch glimpses of a quality of sublime seriousness joined with fervid\r\nbeauty that still makes a strong appeal to modern taste. Ambros well\r\ncharacterizes him as ‘the first musician who impresses us as having\r\ngenius.’ His printed works consist of 19 masses (32 are extant), more\r\nthan 150 motets, and about 50 secular works. Of his masses the most\r\nbeautiful and the most advanced in style are the _Ad fugam_, the\r\n_De Beata Virgine_, the _Da pacem_, and the _La, sol, fa, re, mi_.\r\nIn Naumann’s judgment, no master of modern times has surpassed the\r\ngrandeur of the _Incarnatus_ from the _Missa Da pacem_. When not in\r\na trifling or humorous mood, he rises above form and technique into\r\nthe realm of expression where, among vocal contrapuntists, he is\r\nexcelled only by Lassus and Palestrina. The music of Dufay and his\r\ncontemporaries was frequently beautiful, but it was helpless to reflect\r\nthe character of the words. Whether the words were gay or mournful, the\r\nmusic conveyed the same impression to the listener. But Josquin knew\r\nhow to unlock the expressive power of music and henceforward music more\r\nand more assumed the function of definite delineation of mood and word.\r\n\r\nBut Josquin evidently possessed a light-heartedness and vivacity that\r\nwould not always brook restraint and that led him to introduce bits of\r\nquaint humor into his church music that, to say the least, displayed\r\na lack of reverence and marred an otherwise admirable style. It is\r\nrelated that he much desired to receive a church benefice from Louis\r\nXII of France, at whose court he held an appointment, but as often as\r\nhe applied to the proper official he received only the answer, _Lascia\r\nfare mi_. At length Josquin wearied of the delay and, seizing upon the\r\nmusical sound of the courtier’s words, composed a mass on the subject\r\n_La, sol, fa, re, mi_, which appeared again and again, mimicking the\r\nofficial’s curt and oft-repeated answer. The musician’s wit pleased the\r\nking and won his promise of a benefice, which promise, however, was\r\nstraightway forgotten. But the composer was in nowise discouraged. He\r\ndedicated to the king a motet for which he took the text from the 119th\r\nPsalm (118th in the Vulgate), _Memor esto verbi tui servo tuo, in quo\r\nmihi spem dedisti_ (‘Remember the word unto thy servant, upon which\r\nthou hast caused me to hope’), thinking thereby to quicken the memory\r\nof his royal master. Louis was evidently dull of understanding, for\r\nyet a second time the musical joker dedicated to him a motet, _Portio\r\nmea non est in terra viventium_ (‘My portion is not in the land of\r\nthe living’), which evidently won the object of his desire, for still\r\nanother motet, _Bonitatem fecisti cum servo tuo_, is generally regarded\r\nas a polite thank-offering for the appointment. It is further related\r\nthat the king, who was wholly unmusical and who possessed a very feeble\r\nvoice, requested the great musician to compose a piece in which his\r\nMajesty could join. The sagacious Josquin forthwith wrote a canon for\r\ntwo boys’ voices, supplemented by a part for the king consisting of\r\none note sustained throughout.[23] In his celebrated _Missa Hercules\r\nDux Ferrariae_, a quaint conceit prompted him to build his subject,\r\n_Re ut re ut re fa mi re_, on the succession of syllables whose vowels\r\ncorrespond to the vowels in the words _Hercules Dux Ferrariae_.\r\nThese were innocent pranks, but he carried his musical trifling to\r\nunpardonable extremes in his _Missa didadi_ (‘Dice’ Mass), in which\r\nhe set himself the profane task of solving a dice-problem in terms of\r\nmusical technique. But the faults of Josquin were in large measure\r\nthe faults of his period. In common with Okeghem and others, he was\r\nexceedingly fond of inventing riddle-canons and other musical puzzles.\r\nSo much did this practice, especially in connection with ecclesiastical\r\nmusic, arouse the indignation of Martin Agricola that this worthy\r\nscholar even threatened the composers with the terrors of the last day\r\n‘when all will certainly not go well with the outrageous riddle-makers.’\r\n\r\nThe modernity of Josquin’s art, his ability to interest us by intensity\r\nof expression in depicting the meaning of the words, is finely\r\nillustrated in his two motets _Planxit autem David_ and _Absolon fili\r\nmi_. In the latter especially he attains an expression of pathos, an\r\neffect of extreme sadness, which at times becomes poignant. In the\r\nclosing measures there occurs a remarkably daring use of the augmented\r\nfifth, a dissonance whose introduction is ‘terribly effective.’ His\r\npsalm _Laudate pueri_, in contrasting mood, is pervaded by a persistent\r\nfeeling of joy. The music, which moves happily along through a chain of\r\npure concords without a disturbing dissonance, exhibits tranquillity\r\nand joyful confidence throughout.\r\n\r\nBy a strange perversion the mass, although the most solemn and sacred\r\nportion of the Roman service, was treated by church composers in their\r\nmusical settings of it up to the middle of the sixteenth century as\r\nthe proper parade-ground for all conceivable forms of musical riddles\r\nand extravagances that would display their technical learning and\r\ningenuity. But these aberrations are found much less frequently in\r\nthe motets and madrigals. Here the composer was governed by no such\r\nfancied necessity; he felt a much greater sense of freedom to follow\r\nmusical impulses. Hence these forms were the first to profit from the\r\nremarkable awakening of the musical understanding that took place\r\nat the close of the fifteenth century and to be enriched with the\r\naccompanying first flashes of the dawning sense of harmonic propriety\r\nand characterization.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                   III\r\n\r\nThe motet[24] occupies a place in ecclesiastical music next in\r\nimportance to the mass. It has always been extra-liturgical; the\r\nwords, though not prescribed, are generally selected from the Bible\r\n(the Psalms, antiphons, etc.) or the office-books. In the Roman Church\r\nservice it is intended to be sung at high mass, usually after or in\r\nplace of the plain-song offertorium for the day to fill out the time\r\nwhile the priest is preparing the oblations and presenting them at the\r\naltar. The great antiquity of the motet is attested by the fact that\r\nFranco of Cologne in his epochal work on Measured Music gives it place\r\nin one of the three classes[25] of choral compositions in use in his\r\ntime. The characteristic features of the early motet were separate\r\ntexts for each voice and a subject (_tenor_) made up of some short\r\nphrase or group of motives repeated several or many times, according to\r\nthe length of the composition.\r\n\r\nThese phrases were borrowed from either plain-song or secular\r\nmelodies. Like the mass, the early motet was not an original\r\ncomposition, but the combination of existing chants or secular songs.\r\nFrequently it was frankly secular; more frequently all the texts were\r\nsacred, but sometimes, as in the mass, secular texts and melodies were\r\nmingled with the sacred. When the texts in the motet were various,\r\nthey always bore some kind of mental relation to each other,[26]\r\na condition which was by no means always present in the mass when\r\ndifferent texts were used. The practice of providing each voice-part\r\nwith a separate text, while it tended to confuse the listener, served,\r\non the other hand, to emphasize the musical independence of the parts\r\nand so threw stress on a quality of utmost benefit to the advancement\r\nof contrapuntal methods.\r\n\r\nA few motets by Philip of Vitry,[27] written about 1300, are the most\r\nancient purely church motets of which we have authentic record. We are\r\ninformed by Morley that this composer’s motets ‘were for some time\r\nof all others best esteemed and most used in the church.’ Beginning\r\nprobably in France and cultivated with marked success by the great\r\nNetherlanders, the motet reached its highest point of perfection under\r\nPalestrina in Rome. It was adopted, with important modifications, into\r\nthe services of the two great branches of the Protestant Church from\r\ntheir very beginning. In England, until the ‘full’ anthem finally\r\nsuperseded it, and in Germany from Luther until after Bach’s time, it\r\nheld a high place in ecclesiastical music, but the words were almost\r\ninvariably in the vernacular, while in the Roman service they were\r\nalways in Latin.\r\n\r\nIn the period represented by Okeghem there may be noticed the\r\nbeginning of a distinctive style for motet-music differing quite\r\nmaterially from that of the mass. It has been already stated that the\r\ndisfiguring extravagances and learned complexities which composers\r\nfelt in duty bound to lavish on the music of the mass, were more and\r\nmore avoided in the motet. A solemnity, dignity, and breadth of style,\r\nof which one finds but few examples in the masses of the period, were\r\nencouraged in the motet. This different viewpoint led composers to\r\nfocus their interest and attention on the portrayal of the meaning of\r\nthe words rather than on the working of contrapuntal miracles and the\r\nchurch composers of the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries left a rich\r\nlegacy of compositions in this form appropriate to their appointed\r\nuse and permeated with the spirit of devotion and reverence. After\r\nthe compelling genius of Des Prés had once revealed the expressive\r\ncapabilities of music, this new power was evoked with so much\r\nenthusiasm by all his great contemporaries and successors among the\r\nNetherlanders that the richest period of motet writing is to be found\r\nbetween the years 1500 and 1600.\r\n\r\nAs soon as the text became a matter of solicitous care on the part\r\nof composers, there can be discovered a number of distinct groups of\r\nmotets, distinguished from each other by the character of the texts\r\nemployed, each group possessing certain individual peculiarities. There\r\nwas a numerous class based on selections from the Gospels dealing with\r\nthe various parables, as the Pharisee and Publican. The Passion of our\r\nLord as given in the different Gospels formed the basis of another\r\nlarge group. One of the earliest of these Passion motets is Hobrecht’s,\r\na work filled with deep pathos and tender sadness. The Passion motets\r\nof Loyset Compère (about 1450-1518) are spoken of as possessing\r\nextraordinary beauty. The Magnificat was frequently treated in motet\r\nform, the oldest known example of which is Dufay’s. A vast number of\r\ntexts were drawn from the Book of Canticles, while the Lamentations\r\nof Jeremiah inspired the writing of numberless compositions in motet\r\nstyle. Carpentrasso’s Lamentations were sung in the Sistine Chapel\r\nonce each year until 1587, when they were superseded by Palestrina’s\r\nsuperb compositions. Several of the sequences were also set as motets,\r\namong which must be especially noted two by Josquin des Prés--a\r\n_Victimæ Paschali_, in which he used parts of the old plain-song\r\nmelody intermingled with two popular airs, and a _Stabat Mater_, the\r\nsubject for which he borrowed from a secular air of the time, _Comme\r\nfemme_. Less interesting were the laudatory motets inscribed to princes\r\nand nobles by the composers attached to their individual courts, and\r\nthe countless motets written for the greater festivals and special\r\noccasions in the church calendar.\r\n\r\nReverence for the Virgin-mother inspired some of the most beautiful\r\nof all motets and a multitude of these fine compositions, delicate in\r\ntexture and of impressive beauty, might be cited; such are Dufay’s\r\n_Ave Regina, Salve Virgo_, and _Flos florum, fons amorum_; Brassart’s\r\n_Ave Maria_; Bianchoys’ _Beata Dei genetrix_; Arcadelt’s _Ave Maria_,\r\nwhich is now probably one of the best known of sixteenth-century motets\r\nand which sounds wonderfully modern with its compact chords, sweet\r\ntunefulness, and simple pathos; Gombert’s _Vita dulcedo_; Josquin’s\r\n_Ave vera virginitas_. There remains to be mentioned the large group\r\nof funeral motets or _Næniæ_, comprising some of the finest examples\r\nof the pure motet style. One of the most celebrated of these is the\r\ndirge written by Josquin in memory of his friend and teacher Okeghem,\r\nwhich is scarcely exceeded in beauty by anything which this master has\r\nproduced.\r\n\r\nAbout 1500 the triad was recognized as a musical factor of importance\r\nand close upon this recognition came the discovery of modal harmony.\r\nChord progressions, groups of closely-knit harmonies, appropriate to\r\nthe church mode employed, now became common and in the relation of\r\nthis new factor to musical expression is to be found the basis of\r\ndistinction between secular and sacred music, a distinction which\r\nrapidly grew more marked as the harmonic sense unfolded and developed.\r\nFrom Josquin’s time secular music strove after the representation\r\nof specific moods of feeling suggested by the words, in which\r\nrepresentation the new element of harmony was summoned to give warmth\r\nand color and dramatic significance, while sacred music sought to\r\nexpress only the general mood of the text, representing an unvariable\r\nand fixed aspiration, with little or no attempt at detailed delineation.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                   IV\r\n\r\nThe last great Netherlander, and indeed the greatest of them all, was\r\nOrlandus Lassus or Orlando di Lasso (1532-1594), who spent nearly the\r\nwhole of the best creative period of his life outside the boundaries\r\nof his native land in Munich in the service of the art-loving Duke\r\nAlbert V and his son Duke William of Bavaria. Next to Palestrina the\r\ngreatest genius of the sixteenth century, he left a deep impress on the\r\ndevelopment of Germanic art. Though not so ideal in purely ritual-music\r\nas his great contemporary, he displayed a greater fertility, a wider\r\nsympathy, and a warmer human feeling. Proske’s estimate of him is\r\nnoteworthy: ‘Lassus is a universal genius.... No one resembles so\r\nclosely the great Handel, and, as in the latter, the German, Italian,\r\nand English genius of the eighteenth century were found blended, so\r\nin Lassus the entire glory of contemporary Germanic and Latin art was\r\ncommingled in a single mighty personality.’ (_Musica Divina_, Vol. I,\r\np. 52.)\r\n\r\nLassus was probably the most prolific composer of all time, having\r\nleft the enormous number of nearly 2,500 separate compositions. As\r\nhis master, Duke Albert, was a staunch and devout Catholic, by far\r\nthe larger part of his creative energy was expended in the field\r\nof pure church-music, of which he wrote no less than 1,200 motets\r\nand _sacræ cantiones_, 51 masses, about 180 Magnificats, and over\r\n150 lamentations, psalms, hymns, Requiems, Ave Marias, antiphons,\r\netc. The most celebrated of his works and, according to Ambros,[28]\r\nthe only other work of the sixteenth century worthy to stand beside\r\nPalestrina’s _Missa Papæ Marcelli_, are the ‘Penitential Psalms,’\r\nwhich were composed at the duke’s suggestion prior to 1565, though\r\nnot published until 1584. The establishment of the date of their\r\ncomposition definitely upsets the familiar legend that they were\r\nwritten for Charles IX of France to solace his troubled conscience\r\nafter the horrors of the massacre of St. Bartholomew. It may well\r\nbe, however, that they were sung before this unhappy monarch, for\r\nLassus spent some time at the court of France at Charles’ invitation.\r\nLassus’ masterpiece, though written comparatively early in his career,\r\npossesses in a marked degree all the qualities of strength, grandeur,\r\ndignity, repose, and especially impersonality and absence of what\r\nwould now be called dramatic effects, that are the distinguishing\r\ncharacteristics of the maturest period of ritual-music of the great\r\nNetherlander and his Italian compeer, Palestrina. The ‘Penitential\r\nPsalms’ (the 6th, 32d, 38th, 51st, 102d, 130th, and 143d) were set\r\nfor from two to six voices, according to the suggestion of the text,\r\nand the style of expression varies from the extreme simplicity of the\r\nopening chords to the massive and intricate tone-structures by means\r\nof which he depicts the remorse and fear of the penitent sinner. But,\r\nwhile a note of sorrow and wailing runs throughout, the master has with\r\nequal genius portrayed the strong consolation of sincere repentance and\r\nthe sure hope of pardon from a loving God.\r\n\r\nIn all of Lassus’ works there is a noticeable breaking away from\r\nthe intricacies and complicated forms of Josquin and the older\r\nNetherlanders in favor of a more direct and simple style. Secular music\r\nmay well have exerted an indirect influence to produce such a result,\r\nbut a more direct cause must be sought in the religious movements of\r\nhis period. Lassus, like Palestrina, was a man of strong and sincere\r\nreligious convictions. Zealous Catholics in Rome were seeking to reform\r\nthe abuses in ecclesiastical government and procedure that had started\r\nthe Reformation and given such astonishing strength to its progress.\r\nThe court at Munich, in which Lassus was such a prominent figure, was\r\nthe first in Europe to espouse the cause of this counter-reformation.\r\nSimplicity of style and directness of expression were the natural\r\nand logical consequences of the earnestness of purpose and religious\r\nconviction that breathes in the music of both Lassus and Palestrina and\r\nthat sought to grasp the essential spirit of the Roman liturgy and body\r\nit forth in vitalizing tones. Indeed, the tendency toward a simpler\r\nand less ornate style was well under way before the Council of Trent\r\nundertook to discuss the defects in the prevalent church style.\r\n\r\nOf Lassus’ 1,200 compositions of the motet type 429 were called\r\n_sacræ cantiones_, a term that is rather vague as to its inclusion\r\nand exact application. The most famous of the motets is the masterly\r\n_Gustate et Videte_, to which additional interest is attached from a\r\npretty story related by Heinrich Delmotte, one of the most reliable of\r\nLassus’ biographers, to the effect that, during the festival of Corpus\r\nChristi in 1584, the singing of this motet, as the solemn procession\r\nheaded by the choir emerged from the church, caused the sun to shine\r\nforth brightly in the midst of a terrific thunder-storm, permitting the\r\nprocession to traverse its accustomed course through the city. But when\r\nthe procession returned to the church and the singing ceased, the storm\r\nburst forth again in all its fury. The multitude cried ‘A miracle,’ and\r\nfor many years thereafter the singing of this motet always accompanied\r\nthe offering up of prayers for fine weather. Though one might select\r\na score of his fine motets for special mention, three may be spoken\r\nof here in addition to the _Gustate_, namely, _Dixit autem Maria_,\r\n_Improperium expectabit cor meum_, and _Timor et Tremor_ in six parts,\r\nreplete with wonderful vocal effects. His simple, direct, and earnest\r\nstyle is well set forth in the _Adoramus te Christe_, a short chorale\r\nfor four male voices, utterly devoid of contrapuntal artifice, yet\r\nbreathing a spirit of humble adoration that maintains throughout an\r\natmosphere of solemn tenderness. His motets were written for from two\r\nto twelve voices and the masses for four and five voices.\r\n\r\nBut Lassus had an open heart also for secular inspiration. The genius\r\nthat could thrill us with the solemnity and pathos of religious\r\naspirations and sentiments was also moved to expression by the\r\npleasantries of human experience; no other composer of his century was\r\nso prolific in humorous works. One is a setting of the Psalm _Super\r\nflumina Babylonis_, in which the separate letters and syllables are\r\nsung in the fashion of a spelling-lesson, ‘S-U--Su--P-E-R--per--Super,’\r\nevidently parodying the ridiculous handling of words by the older\r\nmasters. It takes two movements of this comic procedure to get through\r\nthe first verse. In some of his German songs his humor rises to the\r\nheight of hilarious joy, though most of them are the expression of a\r\nsimple naïveté. In one of his Italian villanellas he makes a German\r\ninfantry captain sing a grotesque serenade to his lady-love. But he was\r\nespecially famous for his drinking songs, one of the most celebrated of\r\nwhich was a setting of Walter Mapes’ convivial song _Si bene perpendi,\r\ncausæ sunt quinque bibendi_, to which Dean Aldrich has given the\r\nfollowing well-known translation:\r\n\r\n      ‘If all be true that I do think,\r\n      There are five reasons we should drink:\r\n      Good wine, a friend, or being dry,\r\n      Or lest you should be by and by,\r\n      Or any other reason why.’\r\n\r\nThe remainder of his secular compositions comprise 233 madrigals,\r\n34 Latin songs,[29] 370 French songs, and 59 canzonets, which\r\nformidable list reveals him as a lyric writer of great versatility.\r\nNotwithstanding his great fame during his lifetime and the succeeding\r\ngeneration, the last half of the seventeenth century witnessed a great\r\ndecline in his popularity and his music fell into almost complete\r\noblivion, from which it has been happily rescued by the recent revival\r\nof interest in the old masters and especially by the publication by\r\nBreitkopf & Haertel of a complete edition of his works which will\r\ncomprise about sixty volumes.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                   V\r\n\r\nWe are now face to face with one of the greatest geniuses of all\r\ntime, Palestrina,[30] or to give his real name, Giovanni Pierluigi\r\n(1526-1594). Into his hands it was given not only to restore to Italy,\r\nfor a time at least, its leadership in the domain of musical art, but\r\nalso to carry to completion the magnificent structure of polyphonic\r\necclesiastical music founded and fashioned into stately proportions\r\nby the Netherlanders, and to utter the final words in the art of\r\nunaccompanied vocal counterpoint. Thus the cycle of development in\r\nRoman ritual-music was consummated on the very spot where just ten\r\ncenturies before it had found its first definite formulation under\r\nthe guiding hand of Gregory the Great and in perfect consonance with\r\nthe spirit and best traditions of the great liturgy around which\r\nChristian worship had centred through all the intervening centuries,\r\nuntil Luther’s momentous break with Rome had caused a deflection\r\nin the current of religious thought. He summed up all the best\r\nqualities in the art of his predecessors. He added nothing new to\r\nits technique, but, child as he was of the land whose peculiar gift\r\nis melody, he crowned this art with a radiant richness of melodious\r\ncharm and graceful movement which none of his masters could achieve.\r\nPalestrina’s peculiar greatness seems to lie in the supreme fact that,\r\nthrough a perfect sympathy with and understanding of the mysteries of\r\nthe Roman system of worship and through an unequalled mastery of the\r\nNetherlanders’ art of contrapuntal expression, he was able to restore\r\nmusic to its proper relation to the service as established by the Early\r\nChurch, a relation that had been lost by the incongruous and disturbing\r\nintricacies of the musical forms which by their very elaborateness had\r\nso overlaid the text as to render it unintelligible and thus obliterate\r\nthe religious significance of the words and warp the whole function\r\nof music in the larger organism of the mass. This reform was brought\r\nabout by a return to the simpler methods of the ancient church. While\r\nthe musical world around him was teeming with signs of the new spirit\r\nof impending change and progress, his genius, the richest of them\r\nall, was satisfied to dwell within the sanctuary of tradition. While\r\nall his contemporaries were facing forward, filled with the rapture\r\nof discovery and innovation, ‘the Palestrina style belonged rather\r\nto the mediæval world, with its emphasis upon monastic reveries and\r\ncontemplation.’[31] What has been termed ‘the Palestrina style’ had\r\nexisted before his time in isolated church compositions, but, since\r\nhis whole life was dedicated with singular fidelity and purity of\r\npurpose to the development of an exalted and chaste style that would\r\nperfectly reflect the inner spirit of the church ceremonies, his name\r\nhas become attached to a type which is peculiarly his. Its external\r\ncharacteristics are the repudiation of mere intellectual cleverness,\r\nthe avoidance of secularity either in form or in spirit, and the\r\nemployment of an unaffected, indescribable simplicity of expression as\r\nthe best means of preserving the liturgic significance of the text and\r\nenforcing the impressiveness of the music on the worshipper’s mind.\r\nFor its greatest effect this music must be heard in the particular\r\nreligious environment for which it was created. ‘No sensuous melodies,\r\nno dissonant, tension-creating harmonies, no abrupt rhythms distract\r\nthe thoughts and excite the sensibilities. Chains of consonant chords\r\ngrowing out of the combination of smoothly-flowing, closely-interwoven\r\nparts, the contours of which are all but lost in the maze of tones,\r\nlull the mind into that state of submission to indefinite impressions\r\nwhich makes it susceptible to the mystic influence of the ceremonial\r\nand turns it away from worldly things.’[32]\r\n\r\nIn analyzing music of this type it will be found that each\r\nvoice-part is equal in independence and importance with every other\r\nvoice-part; that the voices enter, intertwine, and drop out with\r\nabsolute freedom of movement; that one key is maintained throughout\r\nthe whole composition, with no modulations in the modern sense; that\r\nthe beginnings and endings of the melodic phrases usually occur at\r\ndifferent points in different voices, producing a constant shifting in\r\nthe rhythmical flux that baffles aural analysis and creates a feeling\r\nof vagueness and indefiniteness of design. The changes in dynamics or\r\nin speed are never startling or abrupt, but are accomplished through\r\nalmost imperceptible gradations. Furthermore, certain values entered\r\ninto the construction of these wonderfully plastic creations that were\r\nalmost wholly dependent upon a perfect understanding of purely vocal\r\neffects. ‘The distribution of the components of a chord in order to\r\nproduce the greatest sonority; the alternation of the lower voices\r\nwith the higher; the elimination of voices as a section approached its\r\nclose, until the harmony was reduced at the last syllable to two higher\r\nvoices in _pianissimo_, as though the strain were vanishing into the\r\nupper air; the resolution of tangled polyphony into a sunburst of open\r\ngolden chords; the subtle intrusion of veiled dissonances into the\r\nfluent gleaming concord; the skillful blending of the vocal registers\r\nfor the production of exquisite contrasts of light and shade--these\r\nand many other devices were employed for the attainment of delicate\r\nand lustrous sound tints, with results to which modern chorus writing\r\naffords no parallel.’[33]\r\n\r\nIt is quite characteristic of the inherent and unostentatious\r\ngreatness of Palestrina that the _Missa Papæ Marcelli_, the singing\r\nof which before the Commission of Cardinals in the Sistine Chapel\r\non the nineteenth of June, 1565, caused this mass to be chosen as a\r\nmodel in style and in structure of what all future music of the Roman\r\nliturgy should be, was written several years before that event as an\r\nordinary item of routine loyalty in the service of the church which\r\nhe so devoutly loved.[34] It did not come into being, as has been\r\npersistently proclaimed by legend and history,[35] at the request of\r\nthe Commission nor as a specific answer to the warning of the Council\r\nof Trent that all figured or polyphonic music would be excluded from\r\nthe Roman service because of the current abuses. The name by which this\r\nfamous mass has been known was not given to it until 1567. The Pope\r\nto whom it was dedicated, Marcellus II, had died in 1555, ten years\r\nbefore fame and immortality had been accorded to this composition by\r\nthe award of the Cardinal Commission, but, though he had reigned only\r\ntwenty-three days, Palestrina did not forget his earnest efforts in\r\nbehalf of church-music while he was a Cardinal. This mass stands by\r\nuniversal consent as an unrivalled monument to the piety, depth of\r\nfeeling, and intensity of expression, as well as the technical skill,\r\nof its creator. All technical contrivances, the devices of fugue and\r\ncanon, are in complete subjection to the demands of expression, and\r\nthe listener is never for a moment conscious of the consummate art\r\nwith which the parts are fashioned. Its subjects are all original and\r\nall are of great simplicity, but treated with infinite variety. It is\r\nwritten for six voices--soprano, alto, two tenors of equal compass,\r\nand two equal basses--which are so grouped as constantly to suggest\r\nthe effects of antiphonal choirs. Though an atmosphere of solemnity\r\npervades the whole, each movement has individual characterization.\r\nBaini, Palestrina’s biographer, calls the Kyrie devout, the Gloria\r\nanimated, the Credo majestic, the Sanctus angelic, and the Agnus Dei\r\nprayerful.\r\n\r\nPalestrina wrote in all ninety-three masses for four, five, six,\r\nand eight voices, many of them of surpassing beauty, but only a\r\ncomparatively few are sung outside the Sistine Chapel. The six-part\r\n_Assumpta est Maria_, composed in 1585 for the Papal Choir, is\r\naccounted by many critics to be even more beautiful than the celebrated\r\n_Missa Papæ Marcelli_. It possesses all the fine qualities of the\r\nlatter and is certainly its equal. The _Missa Brevis_[36] was composed\r\nupon subjects taken from the plain-song melody _Audi filia_, upon which\r\nGoudimel had written a fine mass of earlier date. The mass _L’homme\r\narmé_ is one of the very few of his church compositions into which he\r\nintroduced secular melodies. It is quite possible that he took this\r\nmeans of demonstrating that he could excel the Netherlanders on their\r\nown ground, for it is apparently conceived throughout in the Netherland\r\nstyle and is tremendously difficult and elaborate.\r\n\r\nAmong the most superb of his church compositions must be named the\r\nmotets, of which 179 for from four to twelve voices appear in the\r\ncomplete critical edition published by Breitkopf & Haertel in 33\r\nvolumes. Some of these are as unapproachable in their beauty as are\r\nthe masses which gave Palestrina his title of _Musicæ Princeps_. Among\r\nthe finest may be mentioned _Peccantem me quotidie_, filled with an\r\nindescribable sweetness and tenderness of feeling, and _Super flumina\r\nBabylonis_, written soon after the death of his wife Lucrezia, in\r\nwhich can be detected the expression of the pathetic grief of ‘the\r\nheart-broken composer mourning by the banks of the Tiber’ for his lost\r\nwife. His other church compositions include 45 Hymns for the whole\r\nyear, 68 Offertories, and a large number of Lamentations, Magnificats,\r\nVesper-psalms, and Litanies. His setting of the _Stabat Mater_, for\r\nwhich Dr. Burney had a boundless admiration, is one of the most\r\neffective in existence and one of his most celebrated works. The fine\r\n_Improperia_, which are still among the greatest treasures of the Papal\r\nChoir, probably reflect the experiences of his inner life during the\r\nanxious period following his dismissal from the Papal Choir by Paul\r\nIV in 1555, when physical and mental ills attacked the over-sensitive\r\nmaster.\r\n\r\nThe second half of the sixteenth century has been aptly called ‘The\r\nGolden Age of Ecclesiastical Music.’ Further progress was impossible\r\nalong the line of vocal counterpoint brought to such astounding\r\nperfection by Palestrina, yet the Palestrina style found zealous\r\nimitators for a half-century at least after the passing of the great\r\nRoman master. But the spirit of the Renaissance, now rampant in every\r\nfield of human thought, refused to be held in check by church doors,\r\nand the glories of the ‘Golden Age,’ the products of an art rejoicing\r\nin the full maturity of its power, were almost immediately followed\r\nby a period of decadence, in which secular sentimentality was mingled\r\nin strange fellowship with what remained of the majestic devotional\r\nstyle of the old masters. The triumphant progress of secular music,\r\ninstrumental as well as operatic, soon broke down the opposition of\r\nthe ecclesiastical purists, and after Allegri the Palestrina style\r\npractically disappeared. Gregorio Allegri (about 1580-1652) is\r\nremembered now almost wholly by his celebrated _Miserere_ for nine\r\nvoices in two choirs, which is considered to be one of the finest\r\ncompositions ever conceived for the Roman service. Until recently\r\nat least, it has been sung annually during Holy Week at the Sistine\r\nChapel, where it was prized as so rare a treasure that to copy it was\r\npunishable with excommunication.[37] Up to the year 1770 only three\r\ncopies are known to have been legally made. In that year, it will be\r\nrecalled, the fourteen-year-old Mozart wrote it down with marvellous\r\naccuracy from the memory of a single performance. Much of the ineffable\r\nsadness of this piece, which, as it is performed in the Sistine Chapel,\r\nhas always aroused the unbounded enthusiasm of musicians, is said to\r\nbe due to certain traditional embellishments or florid passages which\r\nwere introduced in the form of elaborate four-part cadenzas to take the\r\nplace of the simple endings of some of the verses. Mendelssohn, in a\r\nletter to Zelter during his Italian journey in 1831, described in great\r\ndetail the music of these beautiful _abbellimenti_. Of one of these he\r\nsays: ‘It is often repeated, and makes so deep an impression that when\r\nit begins an evident excitement pervades all present.... The soprano\r\nintones the high C in a pure, soft voice, allowing it to vibrate for a\r\ntime, and slowly gliding down, while the alto holds its C steadily, so\r\nthat at first I was under the delusion that the high C was still held\r\nby the soprano. The skill, too, with which the harmony is gradually\r\ndeveloped is truly marvellous.’\r\n\r\nIt must not be supposed that Palestrina was the only great church\r\ncomposer of his period. There were others during his lifetime and\r\nimmediately following, whose genius would have been proclaimed of\r\nthe first magnitude had it not been for the greater effulgence of\r\nPalestrina’s. Giovanni Maria Nanino (about 1545-1607) ranks as second\r\nonly to Palestrina among the Italian church composers, as witness his\r\nmotet for six voices, _Hodie nobis cœlorum rex_, annually sung in the\r\nSistine Chapel on Christmas morning; his mass, _Vestiva i colli_, for\r\nfive voices; and particularly his Lamentations set in simple melodious\r\nstyle for four male voices. His brother, Giovanni Bernardino Nanino\r\n(about 1560-about 1618), wrote a remarkable _Salve Regina_ for twelve\r\nvoices in which the new spirit of striving for unusual effects is\r\nnoticeable. Viadana (about 1564-1645) introduced into church music\r\nthe _concerti ecclesiastici_, which were a kind of monodic chant or\r\nsong for from one to four voices with organ accompaniment indicated\r\nby a _basso continuo_, or figured bass. Most of his church music,\r\nhowever, was written in the old contrapuntal style. Following the\r\ntrend of the times, Francesco Soriano or Suriano (1549-about 1621)\r\npermitted the dramatic style of the monodists to enter very perceptibly\r\ninto his ‘Passions for Holy Week,’ probably his best work. Among\r\nthe greatest of Palestrina’s contemporaries was Tomasso da Vittoria\r\n(about 1540-about 1613), sometimes called ‘the Spanish Palestrina.’\r\nHis greatest masterpiece is the elaborate six-part Requiem Mass,\r\ncomposed for the obsequies of the Empress Maria, widow of Maximilian\r\nII. Next to Palestrina’s Mass for the Dead, this is the most important\r\nand profoundly moving among the many settings of this office as pure\r\nritual-music. Its subjects are all taken from plain-song melodies, yet\r\nit has an astonishingly modern quality, due to Vittoria’s employment of\r\npowerful, sonorous chords and especially to a warmer and more direct\r\nand personal mode of expressing his religious emotions than composers\r\nof the polyphonic school were wont to assume. Palestrina’s religious\r\nmusic is the music of a soul of immaculate purity, as though, to use\r\nAmbros’ figure, his strains were messengers from a higher world;\r\nVittoria’s music was the responsive utterance of a saintly soul on\r\nearth, struggling amid poignantly human emotions for a heavenly estate.\r\nAmong his other works, the _Improperia_ gained great renown for their\r\npurity of church style and warmth and tenderness of expression.\r\n\r\nBefore leaving the field of church music of this period, something\r\nmust be said of the worthy rival to the Roman school that had sprung up\r\nand flourished mightily in Venice. Here in the midst of the prosperity,\r\nluxury, and splendor of this cultured ‘Queen of the Seas’ was a group\r\nof earnest musicians who did not fear to loosen the bands of tradition\r\nor to accept new ideals and venture on untrodden paths that led in new\r\ndirections; so that the products of the Venetian school, rather than\r\nthe Roman, formed the natural bridge between the mediæval and modern\r\nconceptions of religious music. The masters of Venetian music, Willaert\r\nand the two Gabrielis, seemed to borrow for their music something of\r\nthe brilliant coloring of the Venetian painters. Luxuriant harmonies,\r\nmassive and bold chord-effects, the employment of numerous chromatic\r\ntones which assisted powerfully in changing the old modal system into\r\nthe modern key system, a desire for greater sonority and contrast in\r\ncolor and expression--all these qualities, with their emphasis upon\r\nindividual characterization, opposed themselves strikingly to the\r\ncalmness, the delicacy, and the impersonality of the Palestrina style.\r\nAll the great Venetian masters occupied the post of chapel-master at\r\nSt. Mark’s, then one of the most important musical appointments in\r\nEurope. The use of several choirs, which was introduced by Adrian\r\nWillaert (about 1480-1562) and became a characteristic feature of\r\nVenetian church music, owed its origin to the architectural structure\r\nof this church, which contains two opposing choir lofts, each with\r\nits own organ. Andrea and Giovanni Gabrieli added a third choir and\r\nwith this elaborate mechanism produced unprecedented choral effects by\r\ningenious groupings of voices, heard now as separate choirs, now in\r\nanswering alternation, now as selected voices from each choir, and now\r\nin magnificent masses of tone. A twelve-part psalm, _Deus misereatur\r\nnostri_, written by G. Gabrieli (1557-1612) for three choirs--one\r\nconsisting of deep voices, one of higher, and the third of the usual\r\nfour parts--is one of the most imposing examples of this type of\r\ngrandiose many-choired music. He is one of the few church composers\r\nwho have left no masses. His most famous work, two volumes of _Sacræ\r\nSymphoniæ_, consisted of motets for from six to sixteen voices, to\r\nwhich he added free accompaniments written for various combinations\r\nof orchestral instruments with organ. In thus broadening the scope\r\nof church music to include instrumental groupings and effects in\r\ncombination with voices, he stands as the pioneer of a dawning movement\r\nfraught with greatest possibilities for the future development of both\r\necclesiastical music and independent instrumental music. The chief work\r\nof Andrea Gabrieli (1510-1586), uncle of Giovanni, was, according to\r\nhis own testimony, the six-part ‘Penitential Psalms,’ though this was\r\noutdone in magnificence and tonal beauty by his many compositions for\r\nseveral choirs. One of the most notable and popular of the Venetian\r\ncomposers was Giovanni Croce (about 1560-1609), whose masses, written\r\nin a style of noble simplicity, are still favorites with Catholic\r\nchurch choirs.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                   VI\r\n\r\nThe century which culminated in the ‘Golden Age of Ecclesiastical\r\nMusic’ was also the period of greatest glory for the madrigal. In the\r\nfirst half of the century its leading exponents were Jacques Arcadelt\r\n(about 1514-about 1555), Philippe Verdelot (dates of birth and death\r\nunknown), Huberto Waelrant (about 1518-1595), and especially Adrian\r\nWillaert (about 1480-1562), in the madrigals of all of whom there are\r\nrevealed a lucidity of style, a graceful melodic flow, and, when the\r\ncharacter of the words demanded, a simplicity of treatment, which\r\ntogether constituted the true sixteenth-century madrigalian style.\r\nArcadelt, a Netherlander by birth and education, lived for many years\r\nin Italy, where his madrigals became so popular that his First Book,\r\npublished in Venice in 1538, passed through sixteen editions in eighty\r\nyears, the first to win marked success. Though he wrote much church\r\nmusic, his fame rests on his charming madrigals, only a few of which,\r\nunfortunately, are accessible in modern form. Waelrant’s _Vorrei\r\nmorire_ (published with English words ‘Hard by a fountain,’ which,\r\nhowever, have no relation to the Italian text) is a beautiful example\r\nof this type. Orlandus Lassus was the last of the great Netherland\r\nmadrigalists and he left many books of splendid compositions in this\r\nstyle.\r\n\r\nIn art-loving Venice an especially brilliant group of madrigalists\r\nappeared who brought added renown and honor to this centre of culture\r\nand learning. Adrian Willaert, one of the many gifted migratory\r\nNetherlanders, was the first to make the Venetians acquainted with\r\nthis form, of distinctly northern origin, and its popularity quickly\r\nspread all over Italy. Under Italian influences the severity of its\r\nmelodic outlines softened and it readily responded to the national\r\nlove of color and warmth. While Willaert can no longer be called the\r\n‘Father of the Madrigal,’ he was one of the first strong writers in\r\nthe madrigal-form, and his transplantation of it from Flanders to\r\nsunny Italy gave to it just the genial quality needed to bring it to\r\nfull maturity. He was especially influential in developing a freer\r\nstyle and a taste for chromaticism. This tendency found strongest\r\naccentuation in the ‘Chromatic Madrigals’[38] of Ciprian de Rore\r\n(1516-1565). He published five books of these and, while many were\r\nin the nature of experiments, they served to prepare the way for the\r\nmastery of chromatic elements so conspicuous in later composers. His\r\nmadrigals, written in an original and genial style of great richness,\r\nenjoyed enormous popularity. Giovanni Croce paid homage to the spirit\r\nof the times in a notable collection of humorous part-songs (_Triaca\r\nmusicale_, _Capricci_) for from four to seven voices. The Gabrielis\r\nwere also generous contributors to the development of the madrigal,\r\nwhich, in its adopted home in Italy, attained its fairest and most\r\nluxuriant flowering.\r\n\r\nThe earliest of the Italians to achieve notable success in\r\nmadrigal-writing was the Roman, Constanzo Festa (died 1545). One\r\nof his madrigals, ‘Down in a flowery vale’ (_Quando ritrovo la mia\r\npastorella_), attained the distinction of being for a long time\r\nthe most widely-known piece of its class in England. Palestrina\r\nshowed his supreme command over all styles by freeing the madrigal\r\nfrom Flemish influences and contributing in goodly measure to the\r\nliterature of this fascinating form. Among them are many _madrigali\r\nspirituali_--compositions midway in seriousness between the motet and\r\nthe light _chanson_, which aimed to bring into church music more of\r\nthe warmth and grace of the best secular music. In the new style of\r\nmadrigal-writing Palestrina was followed with splendid results by his\r\nsuccessor in office as ‘composer to the Papal Choir,’ Felice Anerio,\r\nby Francesco Anerio, brother of the preceding, by the Naninis, and, in\r\nparticular, by Luca Marenzio (about 1560-1599), who devoted himself\r\nespecially to the advancement of secular art and whose madrigals were\r\nof such captivating beauty and expressive power that he earned for\r\nhimself the title of ‘the sweetest swan of Italy.’ His reputation was\r\nfar-extended and his popularity[39] in England was so great that Dr.\r\nBurney not only places him among the greatest of all madrigal writers,\r\nbut traces the passion for this form of secular music that spread over\r\nEngland beginning about 1590, directly to the wide appreciation of his\r\nhighly-perfected madrigal style.\r\n\r\nThe madrigal was carried to Germany by Netherlanders and German\r\nstudents of the Venetians, but it never succeeded in making much\r\nheadway against the national fondness for the folk-song (_Volkslied_),\r\nfrom which it radically differed. Neither was it seriously valued in\r\nFrance, although here the _chanson_ had long enjoyed great popularity\r\nand had furnished the type from which the early Flemish madrigals\r\nwere evolved. English soil, however, was especially favorable to its\r\ndevelopment, and it was no sooner transplanted thither from Italy\r\nand Flanders than it took deep root and flourished with a luxuriance\r\nthat did not lose its splendor beside the best works of Rome or\r\nVenice. Richard Edwards (1523-1566) and William Byrd (1543-1623),\r\nthe latter the greatest English composer of the sixteenth century,\r\nhad both written polyphonic secular songs of the madrigal type that\r\nhad achieved wide fame, but the national love of part-songs received\r\nan extraordinary stimulus from the publication in 1588 of _Musica\r\nTransalpina_,[40] a collection of over fifty madrigals selected from\r\nthe best Flemish and Italian composers of the time and adapted to\r\nEnglish words. These were received with such astonishing favor that\r\nthe madrigal at once leaped into the importance almost of a national\r\ninstitution, fostered by a numerous school of composers who devoted\r\nthemselves almost wholly to perfecting it. All the best English\r\ncomposers delighted in producing madrigals in countless profusion.\r\nBetween the years of 1590 and 1630 no less than 2,000 pieces in this\r\nform were published, so that at the beginning of the seventeenth\r\ncentury the madrigal stands out as the clearest expression of the\r\ncontemporary English national taste, the favorite of composers and\r\npublic alike. The flowering period of the English madrigal was the\r\nfirst two decades of the seventeenth century, when a truly brilliant\r\ngalaxy of native composers developed characteristics that distinguish\r\nit quite clearly from its continental relatives and place it on a\r\nsecure vantage-ground where it need fear no rival. In delicacy,\r\nsimplicity, and a delicious naïveté, some of the English madrigals of\r\nthis period are unapproachable. During the Elizabethan era English\r\nchurch-music reached a high standard, but it sounds restrained and\r\nalmost perfunctory beside the joyous, fresh, spontaneous flow of these\r\nmadrigals.\r\n\r\nChief in importance among the English madrigalists was Thomas Morley\r\n(1557-about 1602), whose music revels in irrepressible cheerfulness\r\nand sweet tunefulness. He showed an especial fondness for the light\r\ncanzonets and ballets, or fa-las, in which latter form, introduced by\r\nhim into England, he is unrivalled. His contemporary, John Dowland\r\n(1563-1626), was equally successful in his canzonets and ‘Songes or\r\nAyres of foure parts.’ But the inspired pieces of John Wilbye (dates\r\nof birth and death unknown) are universally considered to be the\r\nbest representatives of the English madrigal in its purest and most\r\ncharacteristic and comprehensive form. Other great masters of this\r\nform were George Kirbye (died 1634), Thomas Weelkes (about 1575-1623),\r\nJohn Bennet (dates unknown), Michael Este (dates unknown), Thomas\r\nRavenscroft (about 1582-about 1635), and Orlando Gibbons (1583-1625).\r\nThere can be no doubt that the splendor of this era of madrigal-writing\r\nwas made more lustrous by the sympathetic interest taken in this\r\npopular form by many of the best poets of the brilliant Elizabethan\r\nperiod. The works of many of the inspired makers of these sweet old\r\nmelodies are still sung with delight and dearly prized by the numerous\r\nchoral societies and clubs that zealously cultivate unaccompanied\r\nvocal part-music. Since madrigal-writing has experienced somewhat of\r\na revival in recent years, it will be of interest to enumerate some\r\nof the most beautiful and most famous of these old compositions which\r\nstill retain an imperishable charm and undying appeal. Among such will\r\nbe found the following: Dowland’s ‘Awake, sweet Love,’ ‘Come again,’\r\nand ‘Now, oh! now, I needs must part’; Weelkes’ ‘In pride of May,’\r\n‘The Nightingale,’ and the bold ‘Like two proud armies’; Wilbye’s ‘The\r\nLady Oriana’ (in praise of Queen Elizabeth), ‘Flora gave me fairest\r\nflowers,’ ‘Lady, when I behold,’ ‘Down in a valley,’ ‘Draw on, sweet\r\nNight,’ and ‘But Sweet take heed’; and Bateson’s ‘In Heaven lives\r\nOriana.’\r\n\r\nSome of the English madrigalists of this period, as Edwards and\r\nGibbons, were close kin to the Netherlanders in style and feeling. Many\r\nof the madrigals of Byrd, Weelkes, Wilbye, and Kirbye are elaborate in\r\ndesign and display ingenious and delightful imitation, but in general\r\nthere is discoverable a clear tendency to discard the burdensome rules\r\nof ecclesiastical writing. With the development of this tendency the\r\npassing of the madrigal proper began, for the prime essentials of\r\na true madrigal, no matter what it may be called, are that it must\r\nconform to the general feeling of some ecclesiastical mode and must\r\nbe written in accordance with contrapuntal procedure. Without these\r\nqualities the madrigal flavor is lost. After 1620 it began to merge\r\ninto the simpler and lighter glee and part-song, which forms will be\r\nconsidered in Chapter IV.\r\n\r\n\r\n                              FOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[14] Dickinson, ‘Music in the History of the Western Church,’ p. 83.\r\n\r\n[15] The largest contributions to the mass were made by the Eastern\r\nChurch during the first four centuries and were translated into Latin\r\nby the Church of Rome.\r\n\r\n[16] From the Latin _missa_ in the sentence, _Ite, missa est_ (‘Depart,\r\nthe assembly is dismissed’), sung by the deacon immediately before the\r\nclose of the service.\r\n\r\n[17] The practice of thus displacing the authorized Gregorian chants\r\nwith folk-songs was inaugurated by Dufay.

Haberl’s _Die Kardinal-Kommission von 1564 und\r\nPalestrina’s Missa Papæ Marcelli_.\r\n\r\n[36] _Missa Brevis_ was a name given to a mass of moderate length and\r\nnot intended for festival occasions of great solemnity.\r\n\r\n[37] It was published for the first time with the Pope’s permission by\r\nDr. Burney. It is given in almost complete form in Grove’s ‘Dictionary\r\nof Music and Musicians,’ Art. ‘Miserere.’\r\n\r\n[38] The most famous of these, set to Petrarch’s _Vergini_, have in\r\nrecent years been published by Breitkopf and Haertel.\r\n\r\n[39] Of the 57 madrigals in _Musica Transalpina_, published in London\r\nin 1588, ten were by him, and of the twenty-eight numbers in Watson’s\r\n‘Italian Madrigals Englished,’ published in 1590, twenty-three were\r\nfrom his pen.\r\n\r\n[40] Rockstro avers that the word ‘madrigal’ appears for the first\r\ntime in England in the preface to this volume.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                               CHAPTER III\r\n\r\n             THE FIRST CENTURY OF PROTESTANT CHURCH MUSIC\r\n\r\n     Martin Luther; the chorale as the nucleus of German\r\n     Protestant church music--Early Reformation composers:\r\n     Walther, Eccard, Prætorius; influence of church choir schools\r\n     in Germany during the Reformation period--English Protestant\r\n     music, music of the Anglican liturgy: the anthem, its early\r\n     history and style--The spread of congregational song; psalms\r\n     and hymns.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                   I\r\n\r\nChristian art in its general outlines has followed upon the heels of\r\nChristian thought and doctrine with the fidelity and persistence of\r\na shadow. Ever since it first learned definite articulation, it has\r\nresponded with childlike obedience to the varying conditions which\r\nthe church has experienced in its endeavors to win and to hold the\r\nallegiance of humanity to its spiritual leadership. Music, the youngest\r\nof the arts, strikingly illustrates this attitude of dependence.\r\nConsequent on the doctrine of the universality of the church, a marked\r\nsameness and uniformity existed in the ritual-music of French, Italian,\r\nSpanish, German, and English church composers, as long as the supremacy\r\nof the church was undisputed. This absence of variation in style,\r\nform, and expression, this suppression of national and individual\r\ncharacteristics, was the natural manifestation of the doctrine of the\r\ncomplete surrender of the individual, which governed all his relations\r\nto the church. The workings of the forces of humanistic thought in the\r\nsixteenth century brought about some deviations, even in sacred music,\r\nfrom this uniform mode of expression, and in Italy we can easily find\r\npoints of differentiation between the music of Venetian, Roman, and\r\nNeapolitan composers, though all were loyal adherents of the same faith.\r\n\r\nBut when Luther struck the mighty blow at the spiritual and political\r\npower of Rome which loosened a large part of northern Europe from\r\nits grasp and changed the whole current of the world’s religious\r\nthought, it was quite natural that there was a resounding echo in the\r\nmusical methods and forms of expression that accompanied the manifold\r\ndevelopments of this new religious movement. In the discussion of this\r\nmovement as it relates to the subject in hand, two facts need constant\r\nreaffirmation--(1) that even before Luther’s time there had been many\r\nevidences of the impending change in religious thought, evidences that\r\nrun back with more or less frequency even to the Middle Ages,[41] and\r\n(2) that Luther was first of all a reformer, not a destroyer, of the\r\nancient church and her modes of worship. For a full understanding of\r\nthe music of the Reformation it must be kept in mind that the doctrinal\r\npoints back of Luther’s revolt included the denial of the mediatorial\r\nfunction of the priest, the declaration of the universal priesthood of\r\nbelievers, and the stout insistence on the inalienable right of the\r\nindividual believer not only to freedom of reason and conscience, but\r\nto direct access in prayer to Deity at all times. The whole character\r\nand color of Protestant music is derived from this recognition of the\r\nindividual, and his duties and privileges in the direct worship of\r\nGod. This freer, more spontaneous and democratic conception of worship\r\nthrew the emphasis upon the congregation, and Luther’s form of public\r\nworship was built up around this central fact. The two changes most\r\nresponsive to this new conception were the substitution of the people’s\r\nvernacular for Latin as the official language of the service[42]\r\nand the restoration to the people of the office of song, which had\r\nbeen withdrawn from them at the very beginning of the development\r\nof elaborate liturgic forms. This newly-found liturgic use for the\r\npeople’s song caused a prompt development of the singularly rich and\r\nimpressive hymnody of the early German Protestant Church and Luther, in\r\nthe order of services which he prepared for the Wittenberg churches in\r\n1526 (the _Deutsche Messe_), gave especial prominence to this element.\r\n\r\nLuther’s fervent desire was to bring all elements of the church\r\nservice within the comprehension of the whole congregation; it was to\r\nbe a people’s service. The congregational hymns, so conspicuous in his\r\nscheme of public worship, were not only sung in the mother-tongue,\r\nbut many of them were sung to melodies whose origin was equally close\r\nand dear to the people’s heart. Luther was the founder of German\r\nProtestant hymnody (though not of German hymnody, as we shall see), and\r\nin furnishing tunes to the multitude of hymns which he and his helpers\r\nwrote, translated, or adapted, to give voice to the new religious\r\naspirations and ideals of the Protestant faith, recourse was had to two\r\npopular sources, the rich treasury of religious folk-song that had been\r\nin existence for centuries[43] and contemporary secular folk-song of\r\nthe more noble and sedate type. In thus transferring the familiar and\r\nbeloved melodies of home and social life to the use of the sanctuary,\r\nan intimate and personal relation of the congregation to the church\r\nservice was established that was wholly lacking in the old church\r\nassociations. A third source of Luther’s melodies was Gregorian chant\r\nand the stately Catholic hymns. Many of the melodies were original, and\r\nthis was more and more the case as time went on, but the musician of\r\nthis period, as has been pointed out in the discussion of Netherland\r\nmusic, was thoroughly accustomed to borrowing his melodies (subjects)\r\neither from popular song or plain-song. The name ‘chorale’ was soon\r\ngiven to these hymn-melodies, from whatever source they were derived,\r\nand the chorale, from its importance in the Lutheran liturgy, promptly\r\nbecame the nucleus of the whole Lutheran musical system, in exactly\r\nthe same sense that plain-song was of the Roman musical system. Its\r\nclose relation to the sturdy folk-song gave to the chorale and to the\r\nentire literature of religious music evolved from it a virility and\r\nvitality that made it, of all the artistic products of the sixteenth\r\nand seventeenth centuries, alone comparable with the superb creations\r\nof Palestrina and his school. The origin of probably more than half of\r\nthe melodies of the Lutheran chorale-books may be traced to folk-songs\r\nof some kind or period. Moreover, in wedding his hymns to music Luther\r\nwas careful to provide strongly rhythmical melodies, which naturally\r\nmade a more lively appeal to the people than did the unrhythmical Latin\r\nmusic of the Roman service, a fact whose significance has been largely\r\noverlooked by historians. The militant and assertive ring of many of\r\nthe early chorales, contrasting strongly with the calm, contemplative\r\nmood of so many of the Catholic hymns, finds at least partial\r\nexplanation in this fact.\r\n\r\nThe place of Luther in German religious music is quite easy\r\nto estimate now, though it has required over three centuries to\r\ndisentangle the great reformer’s actual achievement in this field\r\nfrom the gross exaggerations and inaccuracies of partisan bias in\r\nboth attack and defence. But if it now seems to be well established\r\nthat Luther actually composed only a few[44] of the 137 melodies once\r\nattributed to him, and that only five of the thirty-six hymns which he\r\nwrote are entirely original, this does not detract one whit from his\r\ngreatness or his wisdom as a leader in pointing musical aspirations in\r\na new direction, for his real significance in German music, whether he\r\ncomposed melodies or not, lies, not in new forms, but in the new spirit\r\nthat he gave to his followers and infused into sacred music. He had no\r\nthought of breaking with the past. In preserving intact the line of\r\ncontinuity, he was wise enough to retain many forms and practices in\r\nthe old Church that he regarded as vital and permanent and to build\r\nthem firmly into the structure of his new liturgy. Realizing the\r\nimportance of having an abundance of hymns for his followers, Luther\r\nonce said to Spalatin, ‘We are looking everywhere for poets,’ and in a\r\nshort time his wish was more than realized in the thousands of original\r\nhymns that were poured forth. But in addition to these he and his\r\ncollaborators did not hesitate to look in other directions. As he had\r\nfreely utilized existing material for his hymn-melodies, so he borrowed\r\nliberally from the magnificent store of religious poetry that had\r\ngradually accumulated during the centuries. The principal sources thus\r\ndrawn upon were (1) old Latin hymns which were translated and modified\r\n(as _Verleih uns Frieden gnädiglich_ from _Da pacem Domine_, a sixth-or\r\nseventh-century antiphon; _Der du bist drei_ from _O Lux beata_, a\r\nfifth-century Epiphany hymn; and _Herr Gott, dich loben wir_ from the\r\n_Te Deum_); (2) early German translations of Latin hymns which were\r\namplified; (3) early German hymns which were corrected or arranged; and\r\n(4) Latin Psalms and other Biblical passages which were translated and\r\nparaphrased in metrical German verse. A fifth and prolific source must\r\nnot be overlooked--secular songs, favorite songs of love and praise of\r\nNature, which were recast into religious hymns by the simple device of\r\naltering a few words or lines.\r\n\r\n\r\n          [Illustration: Luther in the Circle of His Family]\r\n              _After the painting by E. Spangenberg_\r\n\r\n\r\nThe importance of music in the Lutheran service was greatly enhanced\r\nby Luther’s relentless war on the worship of images and pictures. The\r\narts of painting and sculpture practically disappeared from the church\r\nedifices or were put under almost prohibitive restrictions. Music thus\r\nbecame almost the sole artistic accessory to religion in the service\r\nof the Reformed Church. But in music Luther recognized that there was\r\nno real conflict between Protestant and Catholic ideals; hence he\r\nretained the principal features of the musical system of the ancient\r\nChurch, and readjusted them in accordance with his altered conception\r\nof worship. We have observed how he exalted the German hymn, which\r\nhad existed in pre-Reformation times only as an occasional religious\r\nutterance and then always in extra-liturgical services, to a place\r\nof chief importance in congregational worship. In his enthusiasm for\r\ncongregational song, however, there was no antagonism to the choir;\r\non the contrary, he made ample provision for it and urged every\r\nencouragement of the use of contrapuntal music. Luther introduced\r\nonly one real innovation into his musical system--the congregational\r\nchorale; for the rest it was based squarely on existing methods,\r\nadopting with no essential changes the three chief features of the\r\nRoman system: (1) the principles of the old polyphony as developed\r\nby the Netherlanders and Italians; (2) the use of borrowed subjects\r\n(_canti firmi_) as the basis of the church polyphony, the subjects\r\nbeing taken from chorales, however, instead of from plain-song as in\r\nthe Roman system; and (3) a few Gregorian melodies and priestly chants\r\nfor certain parts of the service. Until the church-cantata developed as\r\na distinguishing feature under Bach’s guiding hands, the motet, with\r\nLatin or German words and identical in form and style with the motet\r\nof the old Church, was the chief representative of contrapuntal vocal\r\nmusic in the Reformed Church. The important place which contrapuntal\r\norgan music occupied in the service will be treated in the chapter in\r\nwhich the early organ masters are discussed.\r\n\r\nThe first result of Luther’s efforts to bring about a reform in the\r\nliturgy was the _Formula Missæ_ of 1523. In reality this was simply an\r\nabridged form of the Roman Mass and was intended only as a temporary\r\nexpedient; everything repugnant to the fundamental principles of\r\nthe new faith was omitted, but Latin was retained as the language\r\nof worship. In the _Deutsche Messe_ of 1526 he completed his long\r\ncontemplated and carefully thought out revision of the liturgy, in\r\nwhich the process of simplification was carried still further and the\r\nmother-tongue substituted for Latin in nearly all the offices.\r\n\r\nTwo years before this (1524) he had published the first Protestant\r\nhymn-book (_Geystliche Gesangk Buchleyn_, for four voices), with the\r\nassistance of his friend and musical adviser, Johann Walther. In 1525\r\nWalther published another and larger one, with a preface by Luther.\r\nChorale-books now multiplied with such astonishing rapidity that at\r\nthe time of Luther’s death in 1546 there were no less than sixty\r\ncollections in use, including the various editions. The very first\r\nhymn-melodies sung by the congregation were not harmonized at all. Soon\r\nsimple contrapuntal settings were given to these melodies, and in all\r\nthe early chorale-books the melody, following the contemporary usage\r\nin contrapuntal writing, was placed in the tenor, the congregation\r\nsinging it in unison while the choir supplied the contrapuntal\r\nparts. But by the end of the sixteenth century harmonic feeling had\r\nprogressed far enough to permit the melody to pass to the treble,[45]\r\nwhere it naturally belonged in the people’s song. Henceforth it is\r\ngenerally found there, supported by solid chord-movement, and its early\r\ncontrapuntal character becomes transformed into a simpler harmonic\r\nstyle. The development of the organ in Germany during the closing\r\ndecades of the sixteenth century made it possible for this instrument\r\nto take the place of the choir as an accompaniment to the unison\r\ncongregational song, the choir after 1600 finding ample scope for its\r\npowers in the elaborate motet.\r\n\r\nThe brutal devastation of the Thirty Years’ War was followed by a\r\nweakening of religious faith and vigor, and after the middle of the\r\nseventeenth century interest in the chorale waned and the steady stream\r\nof chorales slackened and soon came to a full stop. The sturdy militant\r\nenthusiasm of the early years of the Reformation was superseded by\r\nreligious apathy which had a corresponding influence on church music.\r\nThe rhythmical freedom and variety of the early chorales gradually\r\ndisappeared and their vigorous character became tamed down to the type\r\nas now sung, in which the tones of the melody assumed a uniform length.\r\nWhile this style is undoubtedly dignified and imposing, it represents a\r\ndistinct loss of energy and vigor, as compared with the original free\r\nform. But the chorale had already passed into the larger arteries of\r\nGerman secular art-music, and here its tremendous powers of stimulation\r\nwere no longer dependent on the spiritual pulse of the church.\r\n\r\nThe historical importance of the chorale can scarcely be\r\noverestimated. Musically speaking, it forms the basis of a large and\r\nsignificant portion of the literature of German music, both vocal and\r\ninstrumental; religiously speaking, it was the effective instrument\r\nthrough which the intensely devout faith of the German people found\r\nits readiest and most expressive voice for their emotions of joy and\r\nthanksgiving in the newly-found office of direct communion with God;\r\npolitically speaking, it was recognized by friend and foe alike as\r\nthe most powerful agency for the spread of the new doctrines. Whole\r\ntowns were said to have been won over to Protestantism by Luther’s\r\nhymns. An irate priest exclaimed: ‘Luther’s songs have damned more\r\nsouls than all his books and speeches.’ Furthermore, the Protestant\r\nhymn exercised an immediate and wholesome influence on the Roman\r\nCatholic hymn. Realizing the popularity and devotional value of\r\nthe Lutheran hymn-singing, the Catholic authorities reversed their\r\ntraditional attitude toward the congregational hymn and strove to stem\r\nthe inroads made by this alluring propaganda on their congregations by\r\nproviding hymn-books of their own in the language of the people. The\r\nfirst German Catholic collection (_Ein New Gesangbüchlin Geystlicher\r\nLieder_) appeared in 1537 in Leipzig, the work of the Dominican monk,\r\nMichael Vehe, of Halle. It contained fifty-two hymns and forty-seven\r\nmelodies, many of which, in altered form, were borrowed from the\r\nProtestant hymn-books, as Luther had borrowed from the best Catholic\r\nhymns. Thus these religious opponents sought to square musical accounts\r\nby freely appropriating each other’s treasures of sacred song. The\r\nsecond Catholic hymn-book (_Geistliche Lieder und Psalmen_) did not\r\nappear until 1567. It was edited by Johann Leisentrit of Bautzen and\r\ncomprised 147 melodies and 250 texts, among which were no less than\r\nsixty-six hymns by Protestant poets, four, indeed, by Luther himself!\r\nThereafter similar hymn-books multiplied rapidly, and the history\r\nof the development and subsequent decline of the Catholic German\r\nhymn coincides quite largely with that of the Lutheran hymn and with\r\nnearly the same contributing causes, political and religious. It is\r\nof interest to note that about 1600 the hymn found its way for a time\r\neven into the office of the Holy Mass. In the eighteenth century the\r\nCatholic hymn sank back into its pre-Reformation status of unimportance\r\nin public worship, but retained its position in the parochial schools,\r\nwhere it was permanently placed early in the seventeenth century.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                   II\r\n\r\nJust as a veritable swarm of religious poets had responded to\r\nLuther’s Macedonian call for hymn-writers, so there soon appeared\r\namong his followers a numerous array of musicians, eager and competent\r\nto furnish the music for the new service. Johann Walther (1496-1570)\r\nwas one of the first composers in the Reformed Church--first in\r\nimportance as well as chronologically. Luther had summoned him to\r\nWittenberg in 1524 to assist him in arranging the musical part\r\nof the German Mass, and, as already mentioned, he played a most\r\nimportant part in arranging and editing the first chorale-books. He\r\nwas the first[46] to harmonize the hymn-melodies after the manner\r\nof secular part-songs, that is, in simple four-part harmony, note\r\nagainst note, which form has characterized the congregational hymn\r\nsince his time. He was the composer of many well-known chorales and\r\nmotets, and there are a few historians who even attribute to him the\r\nauthorship of the melody of the famous _Ein’ feste Burg_. Johann\r\nEccard (1553-1611), a prominent pupil of Orlandus Lassus, appeared\r\nsoon enough after Luther’s passing to be under the direct influence\r\nof the great reformer. He enjoyed great popularity on account of his\r\nsimple and graceful part-songs, chorales, and motets. His chief work\r\nwas _Geistliche Lieder_ (‘A Collection of Fifty-five Sacred Melodies\r\nfor Feast-days and Holy-days’). Another important work was _Preussische\r\nFest-lieder_ (‘Prussian Festival Songs for the Whole Year’) for five\r\nto eight voices. These were somewhat in the nature of a new form,\r\noccupying a place midway in simplicity between the chorale and the\r\nmotet--akin to the chorale in having the melody in the highest part\r\nand possessing a certain folk-song flavor, and approaching the motet\r\nin having the melody contrapuntally dependent on the other parts and\r\ntherefore not to be sung alone. Michael Prætorius (1571-1621) was a\r\nprolific writer of motets, psalms, chorales, and choir-pieces, some of\r\nthe last-named being compositions for several choirs in the Venetian\r\nstyle for as many as thirty voices. From 1605 to 1610 he issued his\r\n_Musæ Sioniæ_, a huge collection of sacred part-songs, including many\r\nof his own, in sixteen volumes, five with Latin words, the remainder\r\nwith German. The name of Johann Crüger (1598-1662) is inseparably\r\nconnected with Lutheran church-song. He was one of the last great\r\ncomposers of chorales--and one of the most prolific--and is remembered\r\nnow chiefly for the large number of these chorales that have remained\r\nfavorites during all the intervening years. Among the best-known are\r\n_Nun danket alle Gott_; _Jesu meine Zuversicht_; _Schmücke dich, O\r\nliebe Seele_; and _Jesu meine Freude_. Most of his chorales were\r\nwritten in the rhythmically regular and subdued form which later was\r\naccepted as the modern idea of the chorale. Other Protestant composers\r\nwho gained distinction as writers of Lutheran church-music before\r\nBach were Joachim von Burck or Moller (1541-1610), celebrated for his\r\n_Odæ sacræ_ or part-songs; Bartholomäus Gesius (about 1555-1613);\r\nMelchior Franck (about 1573-1639); Hermann Schein (1586-1630), known\r\nchiefly by his _Cantional_, published in 1627, consisting of over\r\n200 chorale-melodies, inclusive of about 80 original ones, which he\r\nharmonized, mostly note against note, retaining the old irregular\r\nrhythm of the earliest chorale melodies; and Andreas Hammerschmidt\r\n(1612-1675), who, in his _Musikalische Andachten_ (‘Musical Devotions’)\r\nin five volumes and ‘Dialogues between God and a Faithful Soul’ in two\r\nvolumes, pointed to a new and freer style in sacred composition and\r\nmade a deep impression on contemporary music of the Lutheran service.\r\nWith Heinrich Schütz, who will be discussed in a succeeding chapter,\r\nHammerschmidt constitutes the important connecting link between the\r\nsixteenth-century ecclesiastical style and the perfected forms of\r\nSebastian Bach.\r\n\r\nIn retaining the trained choir for the performance of the more\r\nelaborate choral music of the service, Luther was forced to make\r\nspecial provision for the education of the choristers, for with\r\nthe Reformation came the suppression of the abbeys and monasteries\r\nthat formerly had been the chief supporters of the choir-schools,\r\nand the complete transformation of the choristers from their former\r\nsemi-clerical to a laic status. As early as 1524 he had aroused\r\nProtestant Germany to the imperative need of public education as the\r\nonly means of securing the success and permanence of Protestant ideals,\r\nby addressing a stirring appeal to the councilors of German cities. In\r\nall Protestant centres schools were founded and actively maintained\r\nby municipal, private, and parochial endowment. Music was an integral\r\npart of Luther’s scheme of public education, and in connection with\r\nthe larger institutions he urged the appointment of precentors or\r\ncantors[47] who should have charge of the training of the choristers\r\nand the selection and singing of the church music. These precentorships\r\nbecame a powerful element in the development of Protestant sacred music\r\nand in the diffusion of choral culture. The most famous one was that\r\nof the _Thomasschule_ or School of St. Thomas in Leipzig, where a long\r\nline of illustrious musicians from Schein, Kuhnau, and Sebastian Bach\r\ndown to Moritz Hauptmann, E. F. Richter, and Wilhelm Rust (died 1892)\r\nenjoyed brilliant careers as cantors. Here a choir of about sixty boys\r\nserved four churches--St. Thomas, St. Nicholas, St. Peter, and the\r\nNew-Church. The lay character of the choirs and the close relation\r\nbetween the religious life of the church and the home aided greatly in\r\nthe general movement of popular musical education.\r\n\r\nAnother influential factor in the spread of choral culture was the\r\nwandering choirs, or _currendi_. The ancient custom of pupils from the\r\nmonastic schools going about town on certain festival days and singing\r\nfor alms was utilized in the Reformation period for the twofold purpose\r\nof spreading the new doctrines and strengthening the popular love of\r\nsacred song. The members of these _currendi_ belonged to the lower\r\ngrades of the parochial and cathedral schools, and to them was assigned\r\nthe duty of singing choral responses and chorales in the service.\r\nOn week-days they passed from house to house singing canticles, and\r\nsoon became so much of a public institution that their services were\r\nin demand, at a small fee, for all sorts of home and semi-religious\r\noccasions, such as birthdays, weddings, and baptisms. The older members\r\nof the choirs were recruited in the higher or Latin schools from the\r\n_alumni_ or boys who were given a home in the school buildings and who\r\nin return obligated themselves to serve in the church choir and church\r\norchestra. They received the best vocal and instrumental instruction\r\nand were therefore well equipped to perform the florid and difficult\r\nmusic of the polyphonic masters. The interest of these choristers\r\nin choral music continued after their connection with the choirs as\r\n_alumni_ and _currendani_ (members of the _currendi_) had ceased,\r\nand, as students in seminaries and universities or as plain citizens,\r\nthey exerted a wide influence on choral music either by individually\r\nsupplementing the local choirs or by establishing choruses which were\r\nindependent of the churches but which were used to augment the choirs\r\non important church festivals.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                   III\r\n\r\nWhile the remarkable fermentation caused by Luther’s doctrines was\r\nworking such significant readjustments in the religious, intellectual,\r\nand artistic life of Germany, with echoing responses in adjacent\r\ncontinental countries, a similar movement of revolt and reconstruction\r\ngathered headway in England, generated by the same fundamental causes\r\nbut starting some years later, and resulting in a complete separation\r\nfrom Rome and in the establishment of the Church of England. But the\r\nAnglican Church, like the Lutheran Church, did not stand upon a wholly\r\nindependent basis of its own. Both proclaimed themselves purifiers and\r\nreformers, not destroyers, of the ancient church, hence both retained\r\na large portion of the liturgy of the parent church from which they\r\nrevolted. The Reformation in England, however, developed along quite\r\ndifferent lines from Luther’s energetic movement in Germany. On the\r\ncontinent the revolt from Rome was from first to last a religious\r\nmovement; in England its first outward manifestation was political.\r\nThe incentive which led Henry VIII to break with Pope Clement VII was\r\nnot an unalterable religious conviction such as buttressed Luther at\r\nthe Diet of Worms, but was personal pique at the refusal of the Pope\r\nto recognize the validity of his marriage with Anne Boleyn. In the\r\nAct of Supremacy of 1534 the King and his successors were declared to\r\nbe ‘protector and supreme head on earth of the church and clergy of\r\nEngland,’ but no doctrinal changes were involved and the immediate\r\nresult was merely a change in the name of the church. Yet Henry’s\r\nsecession soon had the result of forming a distinct line of cleavage\r\nfor those who had been secretly sympathizing with the religious ideals\r\nof Luther and Zwingli on the continent and in whose Anglo-Saxon hearts\r\nthe right to independent thought and a liberated reason was deeply\r\ncherished.\r\n\r\nThe real reconstruction of the liturgy for the new national Church in\r\nconformity to fundamental Protestant doctrine began under Edward VI,\r\nwho authorized two forms of the Book of Common Prayer in succession\r\n(1549 and 1552). In 1559 Elizabeth authorized a third form, which\r\nremained in use for over a century. The revision of the Book of Common\r\nPrayer in 1662 under Charles II practically completed the restatement\r\nof doctrine begun by Edward VI.\r\n\r\nThe entire ritual of the Church of England is contained in this Book of\r\nCommon Prayer, and, as far as the ordinary congregational worship is\r\nconcerned, is divided into Matins and Evensong (or Morning Prayer and\r\nEvening Prayer) and the office of Holy Communion. The ritual-music in\r\nall three consists of chants, hymns, anthems, and certain free musical\r\nsettings of the canticles and other constant portions of the liturgy\r\ntechnically called ‘services.’ In all matters of style and construction\r\nthe ‘service’ has closely followed the development of the anthem, the\r\nearly stages of which we shall now trace.\r\n\r\nThe anthem was recognized as a regular part of divine service early\r\nin Elizabeth’s reign, but the word was not actually used in the Prayer\r\nBook until the revision of 1662, which simply states after the third\r\ncollect, ‘In quires and places where they sing here followeth the\r\nanthem.’ A few years after Elizabeth issued the ‘Injunctions’ granting\r\npermission to use ‘a hymn or such like song in churches,’ the word\r\nanthem appears in the second edition of Day’s choral collection,\r\nentitled ‘Certain Notes set forth in four and five Parts to be sung\r\nat the Morning and Evening Prayer and Communion.’ The high place\r\nthat church music has occupied in the thought of English musicians\r\nis amply evidenced by the fact that practically every composer that\r\nEngland has produced has given his most serious efforts to this form.\r\nThe actual output of anthems has been enormous; and, while it may be\r\nsaid with much truth that the qualities of pedantry and dryness are\r\ntoo much in evidence to permit the use of the terms ‘inspiring’ or\r\n‘inspired’ for the bulk of them, it may be maintained with equal truth\r\nthat in no other class of church music, except the mighty individual\r\ncontributions of Palestrina and Bach, has the element of secularity\r\nbeen so rigorously excluded as in the English anthem and its allied\r\nforms. While the religious music of Protestant Germany and Catholic\r\nItaly and France suffered a lamentable relapse in the seventeenth and\r\neighteenth centuries under the insinuating influence of the operatic\r\nstyle, the music of the English cathedral service maintained on the\r\nwhole a serenity and certain austerity of style entirely consistent\r\nwith ecclesiastical ideals and dignity. The best examples of this\r\nstyle--and they are numerous--give to the music of the Anglican Church\r\nan honorable place in the literature of the worship music of the four\r\ngreat historic branches of the church universal, notwithstanding its\r\naverage mediocrity and the absence of really great names among English\r\nchurch composers.\r\n\r\nThe anthem is the culminating point of the ritual-music of the\r\nAnglican Church, as the cantata was of the early Lutheran Church. In\r\nits more extended form it has much the same general musical structure\r\nas the cantata, comprising choruses, solos, duets, etc., but it has\r\nnever attained the large dimensions of its German analogue. Like the\r\nchurch cantata, it made use of the vernacular from the beginning,\r\nand, thus established on the basis of a direct verbal appeal to the\r\ncongregation, it in time evolved a musical type of its own, clearly\r\ndifferentiated from other distinctive types of church-music and\r\nembodying the essential qualities of the church from whose innermost\r\nbeing it blossomed.\r\n\r\nThe word ‘anthem’ (from the Greek _Antiphona_, through the changing\r\nforms, _antefne_, _antem_, _anthem_) naturally suggests the idea of\r\nantiphonal or responsive music, and it originally had this application,\r\nbut not since the restriction of its use to a specific and distinctive\r\nform of church music. Its text is usually taken from the Psalms or\r\nother portions of the Bible, or from the liturgy. The anthem has never\r\nbeen a real part of the liturgy in the same sense as musical portions\r\nof the ‘service,’ for its words have never been authoritatively\r\nprescribed for the various days of the church calendar, a wide latitude\r\nbeing allowed in this respect.\r\n\r\nFour kinds of anthems are recognized and named according to the vocal\r\nforces employed in performance. They are called ‘full’ when written\r\nfor chorus throughout; ‘verse’ when written for chorus and various\r\ngroupings of solo voices, the chorus being of secondary importance;\r\n‘solo’ when written for chorus and one solo voice; and ‘double’ when\r\nwritten for a double choir singing antiphonally. The ‘full’ anthem\r\nis the natural successor to the earlier Latin motet; the ‘verse’ and\r\n‘solo’ anthems clearly show the influence of Italian solo-forms applied\r\nto the problems of church-music. The utmost freedom of form is now\r\npermitted in the anthem and its dimensions vary from those of a simple\r\nhymn-tune to extended compositions in several movements constructed\r\nwith elaborate contrapuntal skill and employing independent organ, and\r\nsometimes orchestral, accompaniment. In this larger form it approaches\r\nclosely the character of the cantata, although not so individualized in\r\nits parts.\r\n\r\nThe earliest anthems date from the beginning of Elizabeth’s long reign\r\n(1558-1603) and the cultivation of this form has gone on from this\r\nperiod in unbroken continuity, save for the brief ascendency of Puritan\r\nideals during the Commonwealth. The literature of Anglican Church music\r\ndivides itself into four periods of quite distinctive characteristics:\r\n\r\n       I. (1550-1660) in the contrapuntal style of the unaccompanied\r\n          motet;\r\n\r\n      II. (1660-1720) the beginning of the modern free style;\r\n\r\n     III. (1720-1850) middle modern; and\r\n\r\n      IV. 1850 to the present.\r\n\r\nThe peculiar character of the English Reformation in its early stages\r\nwas reflected in the ritual-music of the newly-founded national\r\nchurch. The leaders of the Protestant movement on the continent were\r\nmostly men who sprang from the ranks of the common people. It was in\r\nlarge measure a democratic and popular movement. It was only natural\r\nthat the music of the people should find an echoing response in the\r\nmusic of the church which sprang from such a foundation, and thus the\r\nchorale, adapted from or closely related to folk-music, forced its way\r\ninto the Lutheran ritual-music and exercised a profound influence on\r\nall aspects of the worship-music of German Protestantism. The English\r\nReformation had no such popular basis. The various stages of its\r\nprogress were in the main determined by royal edicts or by acts of\r\nparliaments subservient to the royal will. No channel was open through\r\nwhich the music of the people could exert any appreciable influence on\r\nthe figured music of the Anglican Church. The fragrance of the English\r\nfolk-song may be detected in many an example of English hymnology, but\r\nno such aroma ever penetrated into the atmosphere of the anthem or the\r\n‘service.’\r\n\r\nWhen the break with Rome came and the reorganized Church became an\r\nestablished fact, an astonishingly small number of changes were made,\r\nconsidering the momentous nature of the revolt, either in the general\r\nbody of ecclesiastical officers of the Church or among the church\r\nmusicians. For the first century of its existence the figured music\r\nof the Anglican service was almost identical in character with the\r\ncorresponding portions of the Roman Catholic service. The style and\r\nstructure of the anthem with English words differed in no respect from\r\nthe Latin motet. The traditions of English church-music, traditions\r\nwhose effects are still to be felt in the choral portions, were firmly\r\nlaid by men deeply skilled in polyphonic writing, men whose learning\r\nand musicianship made them worthy compeers of the great continental\r\ncontrapuntists, Lassus and Palestrina.\r\n\r\nAmong the greatest of the church composers of this early period were\r\nsuch men as Thomas Tallis (1529?-1585), whose anthems ‘I Call and\r\nCry’ and ‘All People that on Earth do Dwell’ are fine examples of the\r\nold contrapuntal style; William Byrd (1538?-1623), with his masterful\r\n‘Bow Thine Ear’ and ‘Sing Joyfully’; and Orlando Gibbons (1583-1625),\r\nthe ‘English Palestrina,’ whose ‘Hosanna,’ ‘Lift up your Heads,’ ‘O\r\nClap your Hands together,’ and ‘Almighty and Everlasting God’ have\r\nnot yet ceased to excite admiration and reverence for their solemnity\r\nand dignity. Most of the anthems of this period are ‘full,’ though\r\noccasional ‘verse’ anthems are also to be found. All were essentially\r\n_a cappella_ and relied wholly upon purely vocal effects. Small\r\nportable organs were in common use in many churches, but when they\r\nwere employed as accompaniment they, as well as occasional orchestral\r\ninstruments, merely reinforced the voice-parts or filled out the vocal\r\n‘rests.’\r\n\r\n\r\n                                   IV\r\n\r\nSince the Reformation in all countries was fundamentally democratic,\r\nthough in varying degrees of expression, it was inevitable that the\r\npeople’s song should be given substantial recognition in all forms\r\nof the Protestant service. In Germany the chorale was at once the\r\nutterance of profoundest religious conviction in the sanctuary, in\r\nthe home, and on the battlefield; and the incitement to creative\r\nenergy in more elaborate musical forms. But in respect to its alliance\r\nwith higher forms of art-music, the chorale has no analogue in the\r\nritual-music of other Protestant services. In France, Switzerland,\r\nand the Netherlands, the only form of religious song tolerated by the\r\nReformed Church was Calvin’s austere psalmody, which was the beginning\r\nand end of worship-music in all churches under his leadership. His\r\nintolerant antipathy to everything that even suggested the elaborate\r\nand beautiful forms of the Roman ritual rigidly excluded all polyphonic\r\nor figured music as well as all forms of instrumental accompaniment.\r\nThe Genevan Psalter, published in various editions from 1542 to 1562\r\nwhen it appeared in its complete form, consisted of the metrical\r\ntranslations of the Psalms by Clement Marot and Theodore Beza set, for\r\nthe most part, to adaptations of popular secular French songs, though\r\nmany of the finest tunes have been variously attributed, but without\r\nconclusive proof, to Louis Bourgeois, Guillaume Franc, and Claude\r\nGoudimel. Many of the fine melodies of the Genevan Psalter, such as\r\n‘Old Hundredth’ or the long-metre doxology and ‘Toulon,’ have persisted\r\nin popularity during the centuries and have been permanently enshrined\r\nin Protestant hymnology. Although many editions of the most popular of\r\nthe psalm-tunes appeared for four voices (the melody at first in the\r\ntenor), finely harmonized by Bourgeois, Goudimel and others, no other\r\nthan plain unisonal singing of the tunes was permitted in the church\r\nservice for over two centuries.\r\n\r\nThe movement in favor of congregational song quickly passed to\r\nEngland, where, however, complex conditions prevented the development\r\nof any such uniform type as the chorale. The establishment of the\r\nChurch of England, with its revised liturgy and musical service, had\r\nscarcely been effected when it came into collision with opposition\r\nwithin the Protestant fold far more intense and bitter than any\r\nencountered from its Roman Catholic foes. The Puritan party, in its\r\nexcessive repugnance to all forms of ritualism or ceremonial and in its\r\ninvincible conviction that everything artistic in worship was sinful,\r\nfiercely attacked the Anglican Church as an insincere compromise with\r\npopery. Following Calvin’s leadership, Puritanism threw overboard the\r\nwhole structure of formal worship in the historic church and permitted\r\nin the service no music at all except the congregational singing of the\r\nmetrical psalms. In this wholly democratic conception of worship-music\r\nthere was obviously no incentive to any higher form of musical\r\nexpression. The only contribution of the Dissenters, therefore, to the\r\nliterature of church-music was their hymnody, or rather psalmody, for\r\nthe words, even though many times rewritten and reparaphrased, were\r\nrigidly limited to the Psalms. The first complete English metrical\r\nPsalter[48] was the famous one by Sternhold and Hopkins in 1562, which\r\nheld sway among Puritan congregations for nearly two centuries and a\r\nhalf and was likewise supreme in the Anglican Church for at least a\r\ncentury and a half. The new version of the Psalter by Tate and Brady,\r\npublished in 1696, remained in favor till a still later date or till\r\nabout the middle of the nineteenth century, but the popularity of\r\nboth was seriously challenged by the splendid version of Isaac Watts\r\nin 1719. The origin of the sixty-five different psalm-tunes in the\r\nSternhold and Hopkins collection has been open to much controversy. It\r\nseems highly probable that most of them were of English composition,\r\nthough many were doubtless written in imitation of hymn-tunes that were\r\nfavorites among the French, Swiss, and German Protestants.\r\n\r\nThe congregational song of the Anglican Church in the first century\r\nand a half of its existence likewise kept close to the Psalter. Hymns,\r\nin the German sense of spontaneous expression of individual religious\r\nsentiment, were practically unknown in English religious song until\r\njust before the period of Watts and the Wesleys. The idea that nothing\r\nshould be used in public worship that was not strictly Scriptural\r\ndominated the services of Conformists and Non-conformists alike. To be\r\nsure, a few ancient hymns, such as the _Te Deum_ and _Veni Creator_,\r\ntogether with some canticles and ‘spiritual songs,’ were admitted into\r\nthe Appendix to the Psalter, to be sung in private devotions, but\r\nit was not until the closing years of the seventeenth century that\r\nthe hymn emerged from the protecting care of the Psalms and asserted\r\nitself as an independent form in the service. The first successful\r\ncollection in which it assumed a place of its own was ‘Select Psalms\r\nand Hymns’ for St. James’s, Westminster, 1697. A new and glorious era\r\nfor English hymnody was at hand, in which the hard, prosaic lines of\r\nthe old psalmody were to be laid aside for more spontaneous, inspired\r\nreligious utterance. But if the verses of the old poets of an austere,\r\nunloving religion were to be discarded and gradually forgotten, many of\r\nthe melodies to which they were sung have lived to be joined to words\r\nof sweeter comfort and more joyous hope than the English religionists\r\nof those olden days permitted themselves. Most of the early tunes were\r\nwritten in the then prevalent church modes, many were undoubtedly\r\nadapted from English folk-songs and continental melodies, but the names\r\nof many of the greatest English composers of this period--Tye, Tallis,\r\nGibbons, Byrd--lived on in their inspired church tunes and are still\r\nto be found in nearly every modern hymnal in use, whether prepared for\r\nliturgical or non-liturgical services.\r\n\r\n\r\n                              FOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[41] In the ‘Thuringian Mystery, or the Parable of the Ten Virgins,’\r\nwritten evidently by monks and performed for the first time at\r\nEisenach, Thuringia, on April 24, 1322, the futility of intercessory\r\nprayers to saints or even to the Virgin is asserted.\r\n\r\n[42] This substitution was not entirely accomplished during Luther’s\r\nlifetime, however, as a few Latin motets were retained for a long time.\r\n\r\n[43] Philip Wackernagel in his collection of old German hymns (_Das\r\ndeutsche Kirchenlied_) gives 1,448 examples of these, dating from 868\r\nto 1518.\r\n\r\n[44] Only two can with certainty be ascribed to him--_Jesaia dem\r\nPropheten das geschah_ and _Ein’ feste Burg ist unser Gott_--while five\r\nmore are probably by him.\r\n\r\n[45] The first chorale-book to adopt this as a fixed principle was the\r\none published in 1586 at Nuremberg by Lucas Osiander, ‘Fifty Sacred\r\nSongs and Psalms, arranged contrapuntally for four voices, so that a\r\nwhole Christian congregation may unite in the singing of them.’\r\n\r\n[46] _Cf._ Naumann, ‘The History of Music’ (Eng. trans.), Vol. I, p.\r\n473.\r\n\r\n[47] Cantors, however, had existed from early times in the\r\necclesiastical establishments and singing schools (_scholæ cantorum_).\r\n\r\n[48] Sternhold’s first incomplete collection of nineteen psalms was\r\npublished in 1549, the year of his death.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                               CHAPTER IV\r\n\r\n THE EARLY ITALIAN SECULAR CANTATA, THE GERMAN CLASSICAL CANTATA, THE\r\n             ENGLISH ANTHEM, AND OTHER SHORT CHORAL FORMS\r\n\r\n     The entrance of dramatic tendencies into music--Carissimi\r\n     and the early cantata; Rossi, Cesti, and Legrenzi--A.\r\n     Scarlatti, the culminating point in cantata-writing in\r\n     Italy; later developments of the Italian cantata--The German\r\n     church cantata and its relation to the Lutheran service;\r\n     cantata-texts of Neumeister and others--Bach in the service\r\n     of the church; his church cantatas--G.

By a strange\r\ncoincidence this year witnessed the performance of the first oratorio,\r\nCavalieri’s ‘The Representation of Body and Soul,’ in Rome and the\r\nfirst public performance[49] of opera, Peri’s _Euridice_, in Florence.\r\nThese events were of tremendous import in that they not only emphasized\r\nand gave direction to the newly-developed dramatic tendencies, but\r\nmade necessary the further and more complete development of two\r\nclosely-related but subordinate activities--independent instrumental\r\nmusic and pure vocal art. The entrance of a consciously dramatic\r\nelement into musical composition meant a comprehensive widening of\r\nthe area of musical expression. Heretofore music had served its\r\nchief purpose and had found its justification in the service of the\r\nchurch. Though there are portions of the Roman Catholic liturgy\r\nthat are essentially dramatic in their spiritual significance, the\r\navowedly impersonal character of the whole liturgy had excluded the\r\npossibility of utilizing these situations for dramatic treatment, even\r\nin those parts specifically given over to elaborate musical settings.\r\nHad such a dramatic treatment been in consonance with the spirit of\r\nthis liturgy, some of the many opportunities would certainly have\r\nbeen seized upon by such a genius as Palestrina, for there are many\r\nstriking examples in his masses and motets of his wonderful ability to\r\ndelineate the sentiment and mood of the text and reinforce the meaning\r\nand significance of a word by some expressive chord or dissonance.\r\nThese instances serve to suggest how deeply he sensed the genius of the\r\nRoman liturgy and under what admirable artistic restraint he must have\r\nlabored in not exploiting the dramatic possibilities which lay even in\r\nthe limited musical vocabulary of his period. But this restraint was no\r\nlonger necessary in the new secular fields of composition opened up by\r\nthe disciples of ‘the new music’ (_nuove musiche_).\r\n\r\nThe first results of the infusion of this consciously new factor into\r\nmusical speech was an intense activity in all fields of composition\r\nthat offered opportunity for the employment of the _musica parlante_\r\nor _stilo rappresentativo_, as the new form of musical declamation or\r\nrecitative was called that formed the distinguishing characteristic\r\nof the works of Peri, Cavalieri and other early composers of the new\r\nmovement. This new form of musical speech was not intended by the\r\nFlorentine reformers as an invention, but merely as a revival of the\r\nancient manner of declaiming tragedy, using varying degrees of vocal\r\ninflection in accordance with the demands of the rhetorical utterance\r\nof the text, with no reference whatever to melodic structure or design.\r\n\r\nWhile the use of the recitative was at first confined to the\r\nopera,[50] it was only natural that experiments should be made in other\r\nforms, less pretentious, in which it was desired to clothe a poetic\r\ntext with the expressive strength and beauty of musical tones.\r\n\r\nThe term ‘cantata’ came to be used by composers in the early part of\r\nthe seventeenth century (first probably not far from 1650) to designate\r\nsome of these short secular compositions for the chamber, usually\r\ndramatic in character, which were written for a single voice with\r\na simple accompaniment for one instrument, generally a lute. These\r\nsecular compositions were called _cantate da camera_. They were given\r\nwithout action and at first were sung in unbroken recitative, imitating\r\nthe style employed with such success in the operas of Caccini, Peri,\r\nand Monteverdi. But the monotony of this style soon led to the\r\nintroduction of the air or sustained melody, which recurred several\r\ntimes during the progress of the recitative, but with a different text\r\neach time.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                   I\r\n\r\nThe cantata as a distinct musical form was assiduously cultivated by\r\nnearly all of the important Italian composers during the seventeenth\r\ncentury and its form soon began to crystallize along the lines which,\r\nfor the following century, characterized it. In this work of definition\r\nand crystallization, Giacomo Carissimi (born probably 1604, died 1674)\r\nhad a most distinguished part. He also transferred the cantata from the\r\nchamber to the church and wrote prolifically in both secular and sacred\r\nforms. A more detailed analysis of Carissimi’s influence on choral\r\nwriting will be reserved for the discussion of early oratorio, but it\r\nmay be said here that, though he cannot be credited with the invention\r\nof the sacred cantata, he was the first musician of large calibre to\r\nadopt this form and to lavish on it his best thought and most profound\r\nskill. He is generally admitted to have exerted more influence on\r\nthe perfecting of the recitative than any of his contemporaries and\r\nhe firmly established in sacred music those elements of pathos and\r\ndramatic fervor which had proved to be so effective in the opera\r\nand for which the public had acquired so keen an appetite. This\r\nenrichment of the purely musical means of expression in church music\r\nin the interest of greater dramatic realism was by no means a healthy\r\naccretion from the standpoint of pure ecclesiastical music, for, with\r\nthe introduction of the dramatic element and the employment of the solo\r\nvoice with all the possibilities for virtuosity and the temptations for\r\ndisplay, the period of decadence in the music of the Roman Church began.\r\n\r\nAll of Carissimi’s cantatas were for one voice or at most for two and\r\nall were written with accompaniment for a single instrument--lute,\r\nharpsichord, ‘cello, etc. His accompaniments were simple, but displayed\r\nunusual lightness and variety for his period. He left a vast amount\r\nof completed work behind him, but little of it is now available.\r\nDr. Charles Burney,[51] writing near the close of the eighteenth\r\ncentury, when actual performances of Carissimi’s works were not such\r\na matter of ancient history as now, gives warm praise to the beauty\r\nand musical effectiveness of his cantatas and liberally reproduces\r\nmusical extracts. In speaking of a collection of twenty-two of his\r\ncantatas, preserved in Christ Church, Oxford, Burney says: ‘There is\r\nnot one which does not offer something that is still new, curious, and\r\npleasing; but most particularly in the recitatives, many of which seem\r\nthe most expressive, affecting, and perfect that I have seen. In the\r\nairs there are frequently sweet and graceful passages, which more than\r\na hundred years have not impaired.’ His secular cantatas were both\r\nlyric and dramatic. Only one was suggested by a special event, the\r\ndeath of Mary Queen of Scots.\r\n\r\nThe cantata of the seventeenth century was evidently as diverse in\r\nstyle and character as were its descendants in the eighteenth and\r\nnineteenth centuries. It dealt with subjects that were sacred, profane,\r\nheroic, comic, and sometimes ludicrous. The wider range of subjects\r\navailable for the secular or chamber cantata made this form especially\r\nappealing to composers. Then, too, the voice was the most perfectly\r\ndeveloped medium of musical expression that the age provided--the\r\nheritage of centuries of training in the service of the church. While\r\nthe violins of the last half of the century approached the most\r\nperfect specimens that the great Cremona violin-makers produced, this\r\ninstrument was at a disadvantage as compared with the voice, because\r\ninstrumental forms were still very crude and in the making, and the\r\ninstruments on which the violin depends for accompanying harmonic\r\nbackground (the harpsichord and the clavichord) were inadequate,\r\nunsatisfactory, and very limited in their range of musical expression.\r\nAvoidance of a set or arbitrary form was one of the characteristics of\r\nthe seventeenth-century chamber cantata as a whole. This freedom in\r\nform (that is, in the order and kind of arias, etc.) offered greatest\r\nscope for the imagination and intellectual capacities of the composer.\r\nThe period of vocal virtuosity and degeneracy had not yet set in and\r\nthe singers themselves were not only the best trained in everything\r\npertaining to musical science, but were the most intellectual of\r\nmusicians and represented the best phases of musical art and culture.\r\nThe intimacy of the chamber and the absence of scenery and action in\r\nperformance gave the highest incentive and best opportunity to both\r\ncomposer and singer to subordinate everything to the higher demands\r\nof artistic expression. Hence the composers of the seventeenth and\r\nfirst half of the eighteenth centuries regarded the chamber cantata\r\nmuch in the same light that Beethoven and Brahms in the nineteenth\r\ncentury regarded the pianoforte sonata and the violin sonata--the most\r\nintimate and intellectual form of music that the age could produce. All\r\nthe great composers up to and including Handel practised in this form\r\nas Bach did in fugue, and in its exploitation they worked out many a\r\nproblem of thematic development, of contrast in melodic forms, and of\r\ninteresting harmonic structure and key-relationships, thereby enriching\r\nthe vocabulary of the art for succeeding generations. Mention will\r\nhere be made of the more important of Carissimi’s contemporaries and\r\nimmediate successors who gained distinction as writers of cantata and\r\nwho aided in its further development.\r\n\r\nThe elaborate cantatas of Luigi Rossi (born near the end of the\r\nsixteenth century, died about 1650) for a single voice--_a voce\r\nsola_--are among the very earliest examples of this form and are\r\nnoteworthy illustrations of how quickly the vague and indefinite\r\nrecitative of the Florentine monodies began to show tendencies to\r\nformal organization and a pleasing, fluent style for the solo voices.\r\nA fine example of the newly-awakened tendency toward definite form in\r\nsecular music is found in his cantata _Gelosia_, which Burney quotes in\r\nfull in his History and in which Parry[52] finds the following definite\r\nformal scheme, which had evidently been carefully thought out by the\r\ncomposer:\r\n\r\n     A^1. 4/4, declamatory recitative of 23 measures and close.\r\n\r\n     B^1. 3/4, tuneful--nine measures.\r\n\r\n     C^1. 4/4, declamatory recitative of 19 measures.\r\n\r\n     A^2. Same bass as A^1, but different words and varied\r\n            voice-part.\r\n\r\n     B^2. 3/4, same bass as B^1, but different words and different\r\n            voice-part.\r\n\r\n     C^2. 4/4, recitative. Same bass as C^1, but different words\r\n            and different voice-part.\r\n\r\n     A^3. Same music as A^1, but different words.\r\n\r\n     B^3. 3/4, same as B^1, with different words.\r\n\r\n     C^3. Same bass and almost the same voice-part as C^1 till\r\n          last three measures, which are varied to give effect to the\r\n          conclusion.\r\n\r\nMarc’ Antonio Cesti (about 1620-1669) was a pupil of Carissimi and\r\nwent far beyond the efforts of his teacher in the formal construction\r\nof his melodies. His great popularity attests the increasing fondness\r\nof Italian taste for tuneful formality. One of his cantatas, _O cara\r\nlibertà_, is said to have been one of the most famous of the century.\r\nMany of his melodies approximate the characteristic forms in which\r\nlater vocal arias were cast, including the forms consisting of two\r\ncontrasted parts (A B) and of three parts with the contrasted section\r\nin the middle (A B A). In the latter form the third part is a varied or\r\nfree repetition of the first part.\r\n\r\nGiovanni Legrenzi (about 1625-1690), though only five years younger\r\nthan Cesti, made a much larger contribution to the development of his\r\nart, especially on the instrumental side of vocal music. He is credited\r\nwith being one of the first composers to display a real instinct for\r\ninstrumental music, and he is said to have reorganized the orchestra\r\nused to supplement the organ at St. Mark’s, Venice, increasing it to 34\r\nperformers--8 violins, 11 violette (small viola), 2 viole da braccia,\r\n2 viole da gamba, 1 violone (bass viol), 4 theorbos, 2 cornets, 1\r\nbassoon, and 3 trombones. His accompaniments show great vivacity and in\r\ngeneral a variety of style in strong contrast to those of most of his\r\nco-workers. He published many cantatas in which the music runs along\r\nuninterruptedly from beginning to end. The succession of recitatives,\r\nmelodious passages, and what might be called arias varies in each\r\ncantata according to the demands of the texts. A great variety is also\r\nnoticeable in the form of the arias, which are remarkably free in\r\nrhythm and declamatory flow. His cantatas are among the best types of\r\nthis seventeenth-century form.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                   II\r\n\r\nAlessandro Scarlatti (1659-1725) undoubtedly looms largest among the\r\nfigures in Italian music of the seventeenth century and the first half\r\nof the eighteenth century, with especially marked influence in the\r\nfields of opera and cantata. One of the most prolific composers of all\r\nages, he completed 115 operas, many masses (at least 10 survive), 8\r\noratorios, and a vast number of cantatas[53] (500 have come down to\r\nus), besides quantities of music in other forms. The extraordinary\r\nnumber of his chamber cantatas that survive him is strong evidence\r\nof his estimate of and affection for this form, examples of which\r\ncover every period of his life and reflect as faithfully as do\r\nBeethoven’s sonatas the various phases and stages of the composer’s\r\nartistic unfolding. Scarlatti was the greatest of the writers of\r\nchamber-cantatas and only a few of his successors approached him in\r\nexcellence in this field. Indeed, the popularity of this form seems to\r\nhave spent its force in Italy soon after the middle of the eighteenth\r\ncentury. Many of his cantatas bear internal evidence that he regarded\r\nthem as ‘carefully designed studies in composition,’[54] in the\r\nworking out of which he brought to bear his best musicianship. One of\r\nthe finest examples of this careful and beautiful workmanship is the\r\ncantata _Andata a miei sospiri_, two settings of which he wrote for and\r\nsent to his composer-friend, Gasparini, in 1712.\r\n\r\nBut the very fertility of his invention and the ease and rapidity with\r\nwhich his musical thoughts flowed from his pen generated a tendency\r\ntoward the adoption of a stereotyped style, influenced as he was by\r\nthe growing inclination of his pleasure-loving Neapolitan audiences\r\nto demand triviality more than dramatic seriousness, tuneful melody\r\nand vocal display more than sincerity of expression. He did not\r\npossess the rugged tenacity of artistic purpose that drove Gluck, a\r\nhalf-century later, to insist on the primacy of the dramatic intent and\r\nthe complete subordination of the musical element to the dramatic. So\r\nwe find that under his hand the cantata, as well as the opera, became\r\nconventionalized in form. The vocal element, on which he lavished\r\ngreatest care, became predominant and the aria, as the chief means\r\nof vocal utterance, fell under the same spell of conventionality.\r\nBut in the cantatas, especially in the essentially musical parts,\r\nthere are comparatively few evidences of the spirit of triviality\r\nthat he so freely admitted into his operas. It is not true, as is\r\nfrequently asserted, that Scarlatti invented the stereotyped forms\r\nof the aria that were the chief stock in trade of his successors in\r\nItalian opera until the middle of the nineteenth century. Nearly all\r\nof these aria-forms, including the commonest and most banal operatic\r\nform, the one with the indispensable _da capo_, may be found in the\r\ncantatas and operas of the composers already mentioned, among whom the\r\ninclination toward definite organization in melodic form was already\r\nwell developed before Scarlatti had more than begun his career as\r\ncomposer. The incredible number of arias that he wrote and their easy\r\nclassification as to form certainly made this common error of statement\r\na very pardonable one. From his position as the greatest composer of\r\nhis period, however, he gave to their use an authority and an impetus\r\nwhose force was not fully spent for a century and a quarter after his\r\ndeath.\r\n\r\nBut if Scarlatti’s contributions to the cantata and opera were\r\nmainly along the line of the glorification of the purely musical and\r\nvocal elements, in one direction certainly he contributed richly to\r\nthe permanent progress of musical art. In Carissimi’s cantatas the\r\naccompaniments were very simple, written usually with figured bass\r\nonly, which was left to the performers to fill in at their discretion.\r\nAfter Carissimi the accompaniment began to assume a more elaborate\r\ncharacter, but many of Scarlatti’s show utmost care in working out.\r\nMost of these were for violin or ‘cello. Some of those for ‘cello\r\nrequired such large technical equipment that ability to play them was\r\nlooked upon as a mark of distinguished musicianship. Indeed, it was not\r\nuncommon in that age, which was far more superstitious than our own,\r\nfor audiences, deeply impressed with the beauty of tone and marvellous\r\nskill of the performers, to believe and declare that angels had assumed\r\nthe form of men.\r\n\r\nCantata-writing in Italy reached its highest point in A. Scarlatti\r\nand seems to have been, for a period extending, roughly speaking,\r\nfrom 1650 to 1750, almost the only form of vocal music used for\r\nprivate or chamber purposes. As Parry points out, ‘it is certainly\r\ncreditable to the taste of the prosperous classes that a branch of art\r\nwhich had such distinguished qualities should have been so much in\r\ndemand; for the standard of style, notwithstanding obvious defects,\r\nis always high.’[55] But the decline in the standards of opera had an\r\ninevitable effect on the character of its closely allied form, the\r\nchamber-cantata. Though composers continued industriously to employ\r\nit, the finest examples are to be found among the composers already\r\nmentioned. In addition to the above, Giovanni Battista Bassani (about\r\n1657-1716) published numerous cantatas on love themes for one, two,\r\nor three voices with instruments and maintained a noble style in both\r\nvocal and instrumental parts, his handling of the instrumental parts\r\nbeing distinctly an advance over previous composers.\r\n\r\n\r\nIt is to be noted that few, if any, distinguishing or personal marks\r\ncan be discovered in the works of the various Italian composers of\r\nthis period, particularly those whose names follow. All say the same\r\nelegant, suave things in much the same elegant, suave manner. Francesco\r\nGasparini (1668-1727) had such a high reputation in his time that\r\nAlessandro Scarlatti sent his son, Domenico, to study with him. Later\r\na curious rivalry sprang up between Gasparini and the elder Scarlatti,\r\nwhich took the strange guise of a cantata-correspondence in which\r\neach sought to puzzle and outdo the other. Gasparini’s fame, however,\r\nrested on a treatise upon accompaniment, published in 1708, which\r\nremained a standard work in Italy until well along in the nineteenth\r\ncentury. Benedetto Marcello (1686-1739), celebrated for his settings\r\nof 50 psalms for one, two, three, and four voices with accompaniment,\r\npublished 26 cantatas for different voices with accompaniment for\r\nvarious instruments. The Royal Library at Dresden contains copies of\r\ntwo of his cantatas--_Timotheus_, to his own Italian translation of\r\nDryden’s poem, and _Cassandra_--both of which were famous in their\r\ntime. Emanuele Astorga (1681-1736) is remembered now almost entirely by\r\nhis beautiful cantatas for solo voices (soprano or contralto), of which\r\nabout 100 are extant, and for two voices, all with accompaniment in\r\nfigured bass for the harpsichord. Ten of these duets (for soprano and\r\ncontralto) are published in Peters’ Edition and also by Leuckhart with\r\naccompaniment arranged for pianoforte.\r\n\r\nDomenico Scarlatti (1685-1757), son of Alessandro Scarlatti and\r\nespecially famous as a harpsichord player and composer for this\r\ninstrument, wrote many cantatas in which the form became more\r\nextended, comprising various movements. In this extension of form\r\nScarlatti was followed by Pergolesi (1710-1736), whose cantata _Orfeo\r\ned Euridice_, written in the composer’s last illness, was the most\r\nfamous of the period. Giovanni Battista Bononcini (about 1660-about\r\n1750), remembered now as the defeated rival of the great Handel in the\r\nfamous London opera-writing duel, was one of the most prolific of all\r\ncantata writers, though the music was quite mediocre. Other well-known\r\nItalian composers of the eighteenth century who employed the extended\r\ncantata-form were Antonio Caldara (1678-1763) and Niccola Porpora\r\n(1686-1766 or 1767). The great Handel himself wrote many cantatas for\r\nsingle voice in the prevalent fashion and in many of them used for\r\nhis accompaniment such combinations of instruments as strings and\r\noboes. After Handel’s time the cantata of the Italian type described\r\nabove lost favor and was gradually superseded by the concert aria,\r\na form which Mozart, Beethoven, and Mendelssohn have used with fine\r\nresults.[56] Mozart gave the name cantata to a composition for three\r\nsolo voices, chorus, and orchestra in three movements, written about\r\n1783 (Koëchel No. 429). The distinction of having used the chorus in\r\nthe cantata for the first time, however, probably rests with Giovanni\r\nPaësiello (1741-1816), who, in an attempt to revive the waning interest\r\nin this form, sought to give greater vocal effectiveness by contrasting\r\nchoral with solo effects. In this formal respect at least, several\r\nof his cantatas (as _Dafne ed Alceo_ and _Retour de Persée_) are\r\nprototypes of the present-day form.\r\n\r\nThus far in the consideration of the cantata we have been concerned\r\nmainly with its secular form and with its development in Italy. The\r\nsecular cantata in Italian style does not seem to have gained any\r\npermanent popularity outside the land of its birth, certainly not\r\nenough to attract the attention of the best composers either in France,\r\nwhich had developed a dramatic style of its own along different\r\nprinciples from those of the Italians, or in Germany and England, in\r\nboth of which countries the influence of Italian opera predominated. In\r\nFrance only unimportant composers cared to employ it. In England native\r\ncomposers of the seventeenth century found two worthy substitutes for\r\nthe cantata in the masque and the ode.\r\n\r\nIn the very beginning of its career the cantata was successfully placed\r\nwithin the domain of church music by Carissimi, and during his lifetime\r\nand later the church-cantata in Italy had much the same form as that of\r\nthe oratorio, to which it was so closely allied in spirit and function.\r\nBut in Germany, under the influence of the intense religious feeling\r\nengendered by the stormy days of the Reformation, it took on the\r\ncharacter almost of a national religious institution. Here it developed\r\ninto a form of such magnificent proportions and significant influence\r\nthat an extended exposition of some of the contributing causes and\r\naccompanying conditions may be pertinent.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                   III\r\n\r\nGerman choral music, which in its early history means German\r\nchurch music, cannot be considered apart from certain fundamental\r\nnational traits which are present in some degree even in the earliest\r\nfolk-music of this nation and in the effusions of the mediæval\r\nminnesingers--traits which instinctively turned their artistic\r\nattention toward sincerity of poetic thought and utterance rather\r\nthan sensuous beauty of melodic expression. An instinct for grasping\r\nfundamentals, a fervid devotion, and a rugged tenacity in following\r\naccepted ideals--these were qualities that made Germany a fit cradle\r\nfor the Reformation and the German people the foremost defenders and\r\nstoutest preachers of the religious emancipation of the individual\r\nwhich Luther proclaimed with such far-sounding tones. The contrapuntal\r\nskill that German musicians had learned, along with the rest of\r\nEurope, from the Netherland masters, they did not use so much for\r\nthe glorification of music or for æsthetic and formal considerations\r\nas for the enrichment and elucidation of the ideas and sentiments of\r\nthe words. When the rest of Europe had capitulated to the ravishing\r\nsweetness and allurements of Italian melody, Germany listened somewhat\r\nincredulously, and even when this charmer was finally admitted into the\r\ninner courts of its musical household, it was compelled to assume a\r\npurified and chastened form.\r\n\r\nThe essential characteristics of German musical art are well\r\nillustrated by the condition of music in Germany in the seventeenth\r\ncentury as compared with that of Italy. The secular impulse that had\r\nwrought such a revolution in Italian music and musical methods had\r\nmade itself felt in Germany at an even earlier period, but in a very\r\ndifferent manner. In the southern country it brought about an intense\r\ndevelopment of the dramatic element. This almost immediately reacted\r\nupon church music and left upon it an indelible impression, sadly\r\nweakening the Palestrina ideal of impersonality with the impingement of\r\nthe strong personal, human element which the introduction of the solo\r\ninevitably emphasized, and which led, as has been pointed out, to a\r\nperiod of deterioration in Catholic church music.\r\n\r\nThe change in German music can also be traced to a secular source,\r\nbut not only were the immediate results of this change, in terms of\r\nactual music, vastly different from those in Italy, but the controlling\r\nmotive which molded its varied manifestations was alike different.\r\nThe German Protestants were at once summoned to test the strength\r\nand sincerity of their new-found faith in the crucible of physical\r\ncombat, and they were stirred as was possibly no other nation engaged\r\nin the complicated succession of religious wars of the sixteenth and\r\nseventeenth centuries. As it was religious fervor that led them to take\r\nup the sword in defence, so it was religious sentiment and devotion\r\nthat furnished the motive that lies back of the entire scheme of German\r\nmusical art of the seventeenth century. To the rather austere German\r\ncomposers of this period music seemed to be too lovely and pure a thing\r\nto be used for histrionic tricks and trappings. So the most sincere\r\nand important utterances of German musical art of the seventeenth\r\ncentury are to be found in the field of religious music. It has been\r\npointed out (page 79) that the chorale was the basis of the music which\r\nsprang into being as the natural expression of the Protestant movement\r\nin Germany. Since the rich mass of folk-song supplied such abundant\r\nmaterial for the chorales used in the Lutheran service, the secular\r\nelement through this channel entered into the very warp and woof of\r\nGerman music, and carried into it the quality of simple and fervid\r\nsincerity that in a marked degree has always characterized the German\r\nfolk-song and the art-music that sprang from it.\r\n\r\nThe secular element had wrought a complete change in Italian music\r\nwithin the short space of a half century and the impetuous Italians\r\nhad given themselves over to the new tendency so whole-heartedly\r\nthat the boundaries of the old ecclesiastical art were almost wholly\r\nobliterated. An unexpected caution and conservatism, however,\r\nmanifested itself among the Germans and an entire century elapsed\r\nbefore a definite and distinctive art-fabric was evolved from the\r\nmaterial at hand. Composers, now almost wholly forgotten, but who\r\nmight have won more frequent historic mention had they chosen to tread\r\nthe more brilliant path of histrionic art, worked contentedly and\r\nwith pious enthusiasm to make chorales for the church service or to\r\nconstruct motets by using the chorale tunes as subjects and weaving\r\nvoice-parts around them in expressive counterpoint or in imitative\r\nfigures, with all the polyphonic skill they possessed.\r\n\r\nOut of this religious zeal finally emerged the German church cantata,\r\nwhich found its culminating point, as did so many other musical forms\r\nassociated with German church music, in Johann Sebastian Bach. In\r\nItaly and elsewhere in connection with Roman Catholic music, the\r\nchurch cantata never possessed any liturgical significance, though\r\nit was freely employed for purposes of religious entertainment and\r\ninstruction. But almost immediately after its introduction into\r\nGermany through the gifted German students who had studied in Italian\r\nart-centres, notably in Venice, the church cantata became a part of the\r\nregular order of the German Protestant church worship and thus became\r\nthe object of solicitous attention on the part of Protestant German\r\ncomposers. Encouraged by the church and firmly imbedded in its liturgy,\r\nit needed only the touch of Bach’s genius to cause it to grow into\r\nfull artistic stature and stand as the most precious musical gift of\r\nGerman Protestantism to the world. In the seventeenth century it was\r\nfrequently called ‘spiritual concerto’ or ‘spiritual dialogue,’[57]\r\nand consisted of Biblical passages and church or devotional hymns.\r\nDuring this period its rather crude musical form usually followed this\r\norder--an instrumental introduction, a ‘spiritual aria’ (a simple\r\nstrophic song for one or more voices), one or two vocal solos, and a\r\nchorale or two.\r\n\r\nWhile German religious music was cautiously feeling its way toward\r\nindividual self-expression, there were not wanting among German\r\nmusicians those who felt that the forms of Italian dramatic music,\r\nsuch as the recitative and aria with their obvious possibilities for\r\nthe expression of impassioned human feeling, should be fully utilized\r\nin the structure of their new religious art, and who argued that the\r\nqualities of brilliance, variety, and personal utterance should be\r\npresent in ecclesiastical art as well as in secular. On the other hand\r\nwere those who were in favor of banishing from the church service\r\nall vocal music except that based on the austere chorale and motet\r\n(analogous to the Latin motet of the sixteenth century), and who would\r\nrestrict all church music to the more abstract, objective, and liturgic\r\nconception derived from ecclesiastical traditions. Standing on middle\r\nground between these two extreme ideals, Bach, with the insight born of\r\ngenius, retained all that was best and most serviceable in each--the\r\nsimple strength and sturdy devotion of the chorale, together with the\r\ncontrapuntal chorus, as the collective expression of exalted religious\r\nsentiment, and the recitative and Italian aria, chastened and stripped\r\nof its histrionic shallowness and insincerity, as the individual\r\npersonal utterance of the more subjective moods of meditation and\r\nintrospection.\r\n\r\nThe Lutheran Church retained in its liturgy many of the prominent\r\nfeatures of the Roman liturgy. Among them were portions of the mass,\r\nthe custom of chanting certain parts of the service, the singing of\r\nancient hymns and traditional tunes, and the observance of special\r\nchurch days and festivals. The calendar of the church year was largely\r\nthe same in the two faiths, and in the Lutheran Church, as in the\r\nRoman, the order and character of the different portions of the service\r\nwere carefully prescribed by church law. Each Sunday and special day\r\nhad its own appropriate Bible lesson, versicles and prayers, and its\r\nown chorales, the words of which would illustrate the Bible texts\r\nof the day, commenting upon them and applying their lessons to the\r\ncommon experience of the devout worshippers. This intimate relation of\r\nchorales to a definite church-day was of obvious advantage to composers\r\nin that it enabled them to construct, around the chorales as central\r\npoints, compositions which would amplify the sentiment of the stanzas\r\nof the chorales and serve as musical commentaries on the religious\r\nsignificance of the various days of the church calendar. The cantata\r\nthus became the chief musical feature of the Lutheran liturgy, and the\r\nwords brought to the attention of the congregation some particular\r\nfeature of the religious thought that received special emphasis in the\r\norder of the day.\r\n\r\nThe great popularity of the cantata with both church authorities\r\nand congregation in Germany was undoubtedly due in part to the many\r\nopportunities it offered for satisfying the universal craving for\r\ngreater individualization, for freer utterance of individual emotion\r\nand sentiment. The opera of the period, which consisted largely of\r\nsolo-singing, gave free rein to the expression of personal feeling, as\r\nthe spirit of the times demanded. Yet nothing that was really permanent\r\nor artistic could arise from this foundation, since the subjects of\r\nopera were drawn almost exclusively from far-removed classical and\r\nmythological sources. These subjects held little or no real interest\r\nfor the masses, and the singers who impersonated the legendary\r\ncharacters were actuated almost solely by professional vanity. The\r\nopera was thus inevitably surrounded with an atmosphere of insincerity\r\nand moral indifference. While the people applauded, they remained\r\nuntouched except on the surface, and only partly satisfied. When the\r\nelement of personal expression was transferred to church performances,\r\nthe situation was radically changed. Their religious experiences were\r\nreal and vital and tangible. The important part that the congregation\r\nwas encouraged to take in the singing of hymns and chorales gave to\r\nthe zealous worshippers a feeling of individual responsibility in the\r\nservices. Even in those more elaborate musical portions assigned to\r\nthe choir, they could follow, in fancied participation, the religious\r\nemotions set forth in a language that they could readily understand and\r\nthat was intensified by the expressive power of appropriate music. The\r\nintensely subjective, sometimes even sentimental, nature of the texts\r\nmade a deep appeal to the warm Protestant piety of the German people.\r\n\r\nPoetical texts of a semi-dramatic character, suited in more or less\r\ndefinite way to the different church days, soon came to be in great\r\ndemand. The first to supply such cantata texts of real literary merit\r\nwas Erdmann Neumeister (1671-1756), a preacher-poet of Sorau and\r\nHamburg, who wrote no less than five complete cycles of texts for the\r\nchurch calendar. Though a host of other poets followed him in writing\r\nsimilar cantata texts, Neumeister seems to have been unexcelled and\r\nto have had a large influence by the sheer literary excellence of his\r\npoetry and the moving power of his pious eloquence. Both Telemann and\r\nMattheson were appreciative collaborators with him, and among the\r\ncantatas which Bach wrote with such incredible industry for his choir\r\nat St. Thomas’ Church are several with Neumeister’s fine texts.\r\n\r\nNeumeister’s cycles of cantatas were published between the years 1704\r\nand 1716. In the preface to the first of these cycles he frankly stated\r\nthat ‘a cantata has the appearance of a piece taken out of an opera.’\r\nThe publication of these cycles of cantata texts brought on a fierce\r\ncontroversy between his adherents among churchmen and musicians on the\r\none side and the Pietists and those who were swayed by an instinctive\r\nantipathy to theatrical music of any kind on the other. Even the older\r\nand more severe cantatas had been accused of worldliness, but the very\r\nidea of using in the worship of God the recitative and aria, which\r\nwere the chief vehicles of musical expression in the profane opera,\r\nwas repugnant to the pietistic mind. The innovators were charged with\r\nbringing into the church all sorts of ‘singable stuff’ and gay and\r\ndance-like tunes. To this Mattheson, who was chief among the musicians\r\nof his period who could wield a pen in defence of their art-theories,\r\nreplied that of course a distinction must be made between a sacred and\r\nan operatic recitative, and that intelligent musicians knew well enough\r\nhow to treat it in the spirit of the church service and thus preserve\r\na true church style which would be at the same time an independent\r\nstyle.[58] And so the question as to what constitutes the true church\r\nstyle, as to what is pure church music, has been hotly discussed, with\r\ngreater or less absence of brotherly love, in every generation for\r\nthe last two centuries, and, it is to be observed, with much the same\r\narguments as weapons in each succeeding generation.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                   IV\r\n\r\nIn simplest definition church music, as Spitta has concisely said, is\r\nmusic ‘that has grown up within the bosom of the church’[59] and, he\r\nmight have added, that best expresses the essence and spirit of its\r\ndistinctive creedal beliefs. It took centuries for Roman Catholicism\r\nto produce a Palestrina. But, when he did appear, he acted as genius\r\nhas always acted; while the learned theologians of the Council of\r\nTrent were speculating on the true character of church music and\r\nfulminating against abuses, he was quietly creating those wonderful\r\nmasses and motets that have ever since been regarded as the loftiest\r\nmusical embodiment of the spirit of the Roman Catholic liturgy and\r\nwhich, therefore, needed no edict of council or pontiff to establish\r\ntheir supremacy. And so, while lesser musicians were busily engaged\r\nin defending the new ideas, Johann Sebastian Bach (1685-1750), with\r\nall the quiet confidence of genius, was steadily producing works for\r\nthe church service that stand in the same relation to the Lutheran\r\nliturgy and to the spirit of the Lutheran Church of his period that\r\nPalestrina’s music stands to the Roman liturgy.\r\n\r\nThe whole creative energy of Bach’s genius seemed to centre around\r\nhis deeply religious nature. The great majority of his works were\r\nwritten either expressly for the Lutheran Church service or in forms\r\nappropriate to the spirit of this service. He consciously set himself\r\nthe task not only to regenerate church music, which even in his time\r\nhad fallen into melancholy ways, but especially to take the forms\r\nwhich he found already technically developed and to apply them to the\r\nutterance of the exalted ideas of religious life and experience as\r\ninterpreted through the German Protestant faith. Bach was the only\r\none of the eighteenth-century German composers who was completely\r\nequipped for so worthy a task. Springing from sturdy peasant stock,\r\nbred and educated entirely in his own beloved Thuringia and wholly in\r\naccordance with German traditions and Protestant ideals, and never\r\ndeeming it necessary to go abroad for those superficial refinements\r\nwhich his nation lacked, Bach was essentially and peculiarly the\r\nproduct of a culture that was purely German Protestant. He was endowed\r\nwith an intellectual force of truly gigantic proportions and with a\r\ncatholicity wide and wise enough to assimilate whatever was vital and\r\nvigorous in the various musical forms and styles with which the air was\r\nfilled. He was absolute master of organ music, which throughout the\r\nseventeenth century was the only branch of art to develop real splendor\r\nas an indigenous product of the Lutheran Church. Although in thought\r\nand feeling a thoroughgoing churchman, he had the wit to discern that\r\neven the opera, the worldly antipode of the churchly ideal, contained\r\nelements that could be rendered valuable in reverent service to purely\r\nreligious purposes. In Bach’s hands these operatic elements lost their\r\nemotional sensuality, washed clean in the pure impersonal flow of his\r\norgan music. Thus he reconciled the two seemingly dissimilar styles and\r\nfused them into one, which so perfectly expressed the essential being\r\nof the Church he so deeply loved and so loyally served that, as Spitta\r\nasserts, he ‘has remained to this day the last church composer.’[60]\r\n\r\nDuring all his years of musical activity Bach was a church organist and\r\nchoir director. In these positions it was a part of his official duties\r\nto compose music for the various services of the church calendar. The\r\nzeal and fidelity with which he performed this part of his task is\r\nclearly evidenced by the following list of his more important church\r\nworks, vocal and instrumental: about 20 large fantasias, preludes\r\nand fugues, a passacaglia, several toccatas, and a large number of\r\nchorale-preludes and elaborations, about 300 cantatas, 5 Passions, 3\r\noratorios for Christmas, Easter, and Ascension, 5 large masses and\r\nseveral shorter ones, many motets, 2 Magnificats, 5 Sanctuses, etc.\r\n\r\nBy far the largest single group of his compositions consists of\r\nchurch cantatas. Of these he wrote five series for the Sundays and\r\nfestivals of the church year, 295 cantatas in all, of which 266 were\r\nwritten while he was director of music at the Thomas and Nicolai\r\nChurches in Leipzig, which post he held from 1723 until his death\r\nin 1750. They easily take rank among the master’s best works, and,\r\nnotwithstanding the rather astounding fact that for over four years\r\nhe wrote a cantata each week for the following Sunday’s service in\r\naddition to other compositions, they contain many of the finest and\r\nloftiest examples of accompanied church music of his own or any other\r\nperiod, and give unmistakable evidence of the scholarly care and loving\r\nthought he bestowed upon them. As a group they are excelled only by\r\nthe Passions and the great B minor Mass, and some of their choruses\r\nare not surpassed even by these wonderful creations. Not one of them\r\nwas published during his life and many have been lost. The manuscripts\r\nremained almost forgotten for nearly a century after his death, but\r\nthe Bach-Gesellschaft has published about two hundred of them in its\r\nauthoritative edition of the master’s works (1851-1899), comprising\r\nover fifty volumes and forming an enduring monument to the master’s\r\ngenius.\r\n\r\nAn interesting and illuminating light is thrown upon Bach’s attitude\r\ntoward the composition of his church music, especially the cantatas,\r\nwhen we remember that they were all written, not for universal fame\r\nor popular acclaim, but for the use of his own choir and for the\r\nedification of that particular congregation for whom it was his\r\nbusiness to write music. He wrote them, exactly as the minister\r\nwrote his sermons, as personal contributions to the effectiveness\r\nand completeness of individual church services and occasions. There\r\nis little evidence to show that the congregation looked upon these\r\nmasterly compositions in any other light than as regular and necessary\r\nparts of the ordinary routine of service, little dreaming that a future\r\ncentury would give them such lofty valuation.\r\n\r\nThe church cantatas[61] reveal an astonishing versatility and range\r\nof expression which show how completely he surrendered his merely\r\ntechnical musicianship to the guidance of the sentiment and mood of\r\nthe texts, and the needs of their liturgic environment. In these\r\ncantatas he has bequeathed to his church and nation ‘a treasury\r\nof religious song compared with which, for magnitude, diversity,\r\nand power, the creative work of any other church composer that may\r\nbe named--Palestrina, Gabrieli, or whoever he may be--sinks into\r\ninsignificance.’[62]\r\n\r\nIn length they vary from four to seven movements, frequently with an\r\ninstrumental prelude or overture. The shortest consume about twenty\r\nminutes in performance and the longest an hour or so. They are all\r\nwritten with accompaniment for organ and, usually, some solo instrument\r\nor group of instruments. The vocal numbers consist of recitatives,\r\narias, duets, and choruses. In no other eighteenth-century composer\r\ndoes the recitative assume such qualities of expressive and fluent\r\nmelody as in Bach. The arias vary greatly in form, ranging from the use\r\nof the _da capo_, which in his hands loses its Italian superficiality\r\nand conventionality, to the utmost freedom of melodic design. In the\r\nchoruses he found full opportunity for indulging his characteristic\r\nfondness for elaborate and complex polyphonic structures. His\r\nconception of the relation of the voice-parts to the whole tonal scheme\r\ndiffered radically from contemporary usage. To him the solo part was\r\nnot a thing complete in and of itself, but rather a contrapuntal\r\ndetail of a larger tonal unit. Hence the accompaniment usually rises\r\nto melodic importance coordinate with the voice-part. Sometimes,\r\nindeed, the voice-part sinks to secondary consideration, and merely\r\nconcertizes with a more significant theme assigned to the organ or\r\nsome solo instrument. Bach’s whole mode of thought was so essentially\r\ninstrumental in its coloring and expressional devices that he\r\nfrequently produces results that are hardly consonant with what might\r\nbe called vocal idiom. Such a mode of treatment easily lapses into\r\nmonotony and over-austerity, of which there are occasional instances in\r\nall of his vocal works. But there are more than enough counterbalancing\r\nexamples of arias in his cantatas to show how plastic this form could\r\nbecome in his hands for the expression of the deepest and tenderest\r\nsentiments and for the musical delineation of the subtlest details in\r\nthe changing thought of the texts.\r\n\r\nThe chorale, as already mentioned, played a most important rôle in\r\nthe constructional plan of Bach’s cantatas. Since each church day had\r\nits especially appointed chorale (_Hauptlied_), he made it an almost\r\nuniversal practice to introduce this, either in whole or in modified\r\nform, as material for contrapuntal treatment in the voice-parts or in\r\nthe accompaniments of at least several of the movements. In some of\r\nthe cantatas, such as _Wer nur den lieben Gott_ and especially the\r\nfamous _Ein’ feste Burg_, chorales appear in some guise or other in\r\nevery movement, whether recitative, aria, or chorus. There are but\r\nvery few of the cantatas, among them the well-known _Ich hatte viel\r\nBekümmerniss_, in which no chorale-melody appears. The Bach cantata\r\nregularly closed with a chorale in a plain and unornamented four-part\r\nform, but richly harmonized.\r\n\r\nIt is a real misfortune that the profound beauties of these rare\r\nexamples of ecclesiastical art are now practically unknown to any\r\nexcept the occasional student. But there are at least three things\r\nthat have conspired to keep them away from the general knowledge and\r\nappreciation of the present-day public--(1) the Lutheran service, which\r\nin the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries usually lasted for four\r\nhours at least, has been much shortened and the cantata is no longer a\r\nnecessary component, hence at present it is rarely heard even in its\r\noriginal home, the Lutheran service; (2) the organ was such a central\r\nand dominating part of Bach’s whole scheme of musical utterance that\r\nthe cantata cannot be performed with any other accompaniment without\r\na large shrinkage in artistic effectiveness; (3) these works are so\r\ncompletely saturated with the spirit and meaning of the particular\r\ntype of church worship for which they were created that when performed\r\nin the concert room, even with the organ, they lose in large measure,\r\nmerely from the changed perspective and environment. Many of the\r\ncantatas are available for study in Peters’ Edition and, in English\r\ntranslation, in the Novello Edition.\r\n\r\nBach’s vocal polyphony, as illustrated by the intricate choruses of\r\nhis cantatas, was built squarely on his conception of instrumental\r\npolyphony as applied to the church service. All the finest qualities of\r\nhis organ style--the inexhaustible wealth of invention, the masterful\r\nuse of every contrapuntal device for exploiting the thematic material,\r\nthe majestic sweep of massive bodies of closely knit melodies--all\r\nare found in these choruses in a profusion and affluence that show\r\nat once the marvellous fecundity of his genius and the reverent love\r\nand patient care with which his task was wrought. Of the nearly fifty\r\ncantatas that are published with German and English texts, many might\r\njustly be chosen for analysis that would closely approach in excellence\r\nthe few here presented. These few, however, are recognized as among the\r\ngreatest and are thoroughly representative of Bach’s cantata style.\r\nIn addition to these there may also be enumerated _Wer nur den lieben\r\nGott_ (‘If Thou but Sufferest God to Guide Thee’), _Jesu, meine Freude_\r\n(‘Jesu, Priceless Treasure’), _Aus tiefer Noth schrei’ ich zu Dir_\r\n(‘From Depths of Woe I Call on Thee’), and the Ascension cantata _Wer\r\nda glaubet und getauft wird_ (‘Whoso Believeth and Is Baptized’).\r\n\r\n_Ich hatte viel Bekümmerniss_ (‘My Heart was Full of Heaviness’).--This\r\nwork was Bach’s first sacred cantata. He composed it in 1714 at Weimar\r\nwhile still depressed over his difficulties with the elders of the\r\n_Liebfrauenkirche_ at Halle about an organ position; the music is\r\nstrongly colored by this mental condition. It was written for the third\r\nSunday after Trinity and contains eleven numbers. The first part,\r\nwhich is mournful in character, consists of a quiet opening chorus, a\r\nbeautiful aria for soprano accompanied by oboe and strings, a tender\r\nrecitative and aria full of intense sorrow, and a closing chorus\r\ntinged with deep pathos, ‘Why, my Soul, art thou vexed?’ Part II is\r\nmore cheerful. A duet for soprano and bass, who represent the soul and\r\nChrist, is followed by a richly harmonized chorus introducing a chorale\r\nmelody. Then comes a pleasing tenor aria with graceful accompaniment,\r\n‘Rejoice, O my Soul, change weeping to smiling,’ leading to a final\r\nchorus. The words ‘The Lamb that for us is slain, to Him will we\r\nrender power and glory,’ are uttered majestically by the full choir;\r\nthe solo bass gives out the words ‘Power and glory and praise be unto\r\nHim forevermore,’ leading to the final ‘Hallelujah,’ poured forth with\r\ntremendous effect by the combined choir and orchestra.\r\n\r\n_Gottes Zeit ist die allerbeste Zeit_ (‘God’s time is the best of\r\nall’) is usually called the _Actus Tragicus_, and occasionally the\r\n‘Mourning Cantata,’ as it was evidently written to commemorate the\r\ndeath of some aged man. This work, too, was composed at Weimar in\r\nBach’s younger days. The introduction is quiet and tender, introducing\r\nsome themes used later in the body of the cantata. The opening chorus\r\n(‘God’s own time is the best of all. In Him we live, move, and have\r\nour being, as long as He wills. And in Him we die at His good time’)\r\nis at first slow and solemn, but changes to a quick fugue and ends in\r\na strain of mournful beauty, befitting the last part of the text. Next\r\ncomes a tenor solo, ‘O Lord, incline us to consider that our days are\r\nnumbered,’ the text being continued in a mournful aria for bass, ‘Set\r\nin order thine house, for thou shalt die and not live.’ The choir then\r\nsings ‘It is the old decree, Man, thou art mortal,’ the lower voices\r\nforming a double fugue, while the soprano repeats the words ‘Yea, come,\r\nLord Jesus,’ and the orchestra intones the melody of an old hymn, ‘I\r\nhave cast all my care on God.’ The words spoken on the cross, ‘Into\r\nThy hands my spirit I commend,’ are rendered by the alto, the bass\r\nanswering ‘Thou shalt be with Me to-day in Paradise.’ A chorale sung by\r\nthe alto mingles with the last of the bass arioso. The work closes with\r\na chorus, using the so-called Fifth Gloria,\r\n\r\n      ‘All glory, praise, and majesty\r\n      To Father, Son, and Spirit be,\r\n      The holy, blessed Trinity,’ etc.\r\n\r\n_Ein’ feste Burg._--This cantata, one of the strongest of the\r\nremarkable series of church works composed by Bach, is constructed on\r\nLuther’s immortal hymn, the battle-hymn of the Reformation. Historians\r\ndiffer as to the exact time of its composition, but all agree that it\r\nwas when Bach was at the height of his creative power, the occasion\r\nprobably being either the Reformation Festival of 1730 or the\r\nbicentenary of Protestantism in Saxony, May 17, 1739. It is laid out in\r\ntruly grand proportions and is permeated from first to last with the\r\nbold spirit of triumphant confidence that made the old Reformation days\r\nsuch a stirring memory in every German heart. The cantata opens with a\r\nstupendous fugue based on Luther’s melody and using the first stanza\r\nof the hymn, than which Bach never wrote anything grander. Following\r\nthis comes a duet for soprano and bass, the text including the second\r\nstanza. A bass recitative and a soprano aria lead to the second great\r\nchorus, in which the chorale is sung in unison and with mighty effect,\r\namid a whirl of wildly leaping figures in the orchestra, to the third\r\nstanza of the hymn, ‘And were the world all devils o’er And watching\r\nto devour us.’ The sixth number, a tenor recitative, leads to a duet\r\nfor alto and tenor, ‘How blessed then are they who still on God are\r\ncalling.’ The chorale is heard again in the final chorus, this time\r\nsung without accompaniment to the last stanza of the hymn--a thrilling\r\nending to a colossal work.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                   V\r\n\r\nHandel (1685-1759), one of the few great masters of choral writing, was\r\na man in whose life strange contrasts jostled each other. He was born a\r\nGerman, but died a naturalized Englishman and was buried in Westminster\r\nAbbey among England’s most illustrious sons; he was intended by his\r\nparents to be a lawyer, but by nature to be a musician; the greater\r\npart of his life was spent in writing operas, popular in his day but\r\nnow forgotten, while his fame now rests almost entirely on the great\r\noratorios that he wrote after he was fifty years old and had been\r\npractically driven from the operatic stage by intrigues and cabals. He\r\ntowers above all his contemporaries except Bach; while his greatest\r\nmasterpieces are his oratorios, his smaller choral works in secular\r\ncantata-form display his fine instinct for gracious melody, dramatic\r\ncoloring, and characteristic choral effects.\r\n\r\n‘Acis and Galatea.’--This cantata or pastoral (the composer calls it\r\na serenata, under which title it had its first London performance in\r\n1732) was composed by Handel in 1720, while he was chapel-master to\r\nthe Duke of Chandos, and was performed at Cannons the following year.\r\nIn writing it, following a custom very much in vogue among composers\r\nof his time, he drew upon an earlier work composed in 1708 during his\r\nsojourn in Italy. Most of the text was written by the poet John Gay,\r\nthough certain fragments were borrowed from Dryden, Hughes, and Pope.\r\n\r\nThe nymph Galatea deeply loved the shepherd Acis, but in turn was\r\nadored by Polyphemus, the one-eyed Cyclops of Ætna. One day, while she\r\nwas reclining in Acis’ embrace, the giant, believing himself alone,\r\npoured out his story of hopeless love, ending in a burst of jealousy\r\nagainst his rival, when, spying the lovers, he hurled an immense rock\r\nat Acis and crushed him. His blood, gushing forth, became a purling\r\nstream.\r\n\r\nA graceful overture, pastoral in style, leads to a chorus depicting\r\nthe pleasures of rustic life. Galatea enters, seeking her lover, and\r\nsings a recitative, ‘Ye verdant plains and woody mountains,’ followed\r\nby a sweet melody, ‘Hush, ye pretty warbling choir!’ Acis responds with\r\nan aria of exquisite grace and beauty, one of Handel’s finest, ‘Love in\r\nher eyes sits playing and sheds delicious death.’ Galatea replies with\r\nthe famous ‘As when the dove laments her love,’ after which the first\r\npart closes with a sparkling duet and chorus, ‘Happy we.’ Part II opens\r\nwith a chorus of alarm, expressing fear of the love-sick giant and\r\ndescribing the phenomena of Nature at his angry approach. Then follows\r\na recitative by the Cyclops, ‘I melt, I rage, I burn,’ and after it the\r\nwell-known aria, ‘O ruddier than the cherry!’ Acis’ plaintive song,\r\n‘Love sounds the alarm,’ follows in marked contrast. Galatea begs him\r\nto trust the gods and is joined by the other two in the trio, ‘The\r\nflocks shall leave the mountain.’ The Cyclops in a rage then seizes\r\na fragment of Mt. Ætna and crushes the unhappy lover. Galatea’s sad\r\nlament follows, ‘Must I my Acis still bemoan?’ and the work closes with\r\na consolatory chorus of the shepherds and shepherdesses, ‘Galatea, dry\r\nthy tears.’\r\n\r\n‘Alexander’s Feast.’--The text for this work is Dryden’s famous poem,\r\nthe full title of which is ‘Alexander’s Feast or the Power of Music, a\r\nSong in Honour of St. Cecilia’s Day, 1697.’ Handel composed the music\r\nin 1736, completing the first part January 5th, the second January\r\n17th. The work came to its first performance at Covent Garden Theatre,\r\nFebruary 19th, 1736, and met with remarkable success, winning a lasting\r\npopularity which even at the present time makes it one of the five\r\nbest-known of Handel’s choral works. The chief solos are the stormy\r\naria ‘\"Revenge, Revenge!\" Timotheus cries,’ and the great descriptive\r\nrecitative, ‘Give the vengeance due to the valiant crew.’ Some of the\r\nchoruses are among Handel’s finest, equalling those of the ‘Messiah’ or\r\n‘Israel in Egypt.’ They are ‘Behold Darius great and good,’ ‘Break his\r\nbands of sleep asunder,’ ‘Let old Timotheus yield the prize,’ and ‘The\r\nmany rend the skies with loud applause.’\r\n\r\n_L’Allegro._--The full title of this work is _L’Allegro, il Penseroso\r\ned il Moderato_, Milton’s two descriptive poems, _L’Allegro_ and _Il\r\nPenseroso_, supplying the text for the first two movements; but instead\r\nof being preserved as separate poems in the musical work, they are\r\nmade to alternate in sixteen contrasting strophes and anti-strophes.\r\nAllegro, represented by the tenor, sings the praises of pleasure and\r\nlight-heartedness; Penseroso, a soprano, following each time with\r\nthe regularity of a shadow, advocates meditation and seriousness and\r\nmelancholy. The Moderato was an addition supplied by Handel and his\r\nlibrettist, Charles Jennens, and represented chiefly by a chorus, whose\r\npurpose it was to counsel both Allegro and Penseroso to adhere to a\r\nmiddle course as the safest; but this third part is rarely given. The\r\nwork is in Handel’s best style--the Allegro is spirited, the Penseroso\r\nserious and tender, and the Moderato calm and sedate. The music was\r\ncomposed in the seventeen days between January 19th and February 6th,\r\n1740, and was first performed on February 27th of the same year at the\r\nRoyal Theatre, Lincoln’s Inn Fields, London.\r\n\r\nHaydn’s (1732-1809) life-work was indissolubly associated with\r\ninstrumental forms. The parentage and early development of the sonata\r\nand the modern orchestra can be traced directly to him. He wrote\r\ncomparatively little in choral forms and the best of this was in the\r\nfield of oratorio and church music.\r\n\r\nIn 1785 Haydn was commissioned to write ‘The Seven Words of Jesus on\r\nthe Cross,’ sometimes called ‘The Passion,’ as music for the Good\r\nFriday service for the cathedral of Cadiz. As first written it was an\r\ninstrumental work of seven slow movements, which the composer later\r\nproduced in London under the name _Passione Instrumentale_. Later still\r\nhe introduced numbers for solo voices and chorus and, by inserting in\r\nthe middle a _largo_ movement for wind instruments, divided it into two\r\nparts. In this form it was first presented at Vienna in 1796 and was\r\npublished in 1801. The work is simple in structure and a similarity of\r\nmood and character pervades the various movements. It opens with an\r\nimpressive orchestral number, after which each of the Seven Words is\r\nsuccessively stated in the form of a chorale followed by a chorus. In\r\nconclusion comes a descriptive chorus in rapid movement, ‘The Veil of\r\nthe Temple was rent in twain,’ which pictures vividly the darkness, the\r\nearthquake, the rending tombs, and the raising of the saints. Haydn\r\nfrequently expressed a great fondness for this work, and by many of his\r\ncontemporaries it was regarded as one of his most sublime creations.\r\n\r\n_Ariadne auf Naxos._--This cantata, written for a solo voice (soprano)\r\nand orchestra, is dated 1782. It is one of the most perfect examples\r\nof the original cantata form, the Italian _cantata da camera_ already\r\ndescribed. The story is that of Ariadne, daughter of Minos, king of\r\nCrete, who, desperately in love with Theseus, son of Ægeus, king of\r\nAthens, aids him with a thread to escape from the labyrinth after\r\nslaying the Minotaur, and accompanies him on his return to Athens. She\r\nawakens on the island of Naxos to find herself abandoned by her lover,\r\nand here the cantata opens. The music pictures her awakening, her\r\ngradual realization of Theseus’ perfidy, her anxiety, her anger, and\r\nher despair. The vocal score is intricate, demanding not only facility\r\nin execution, but also a noble style of musical declamation, great\r\nmusical intelligence, and refinement of sentiment.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nOutside of the instrumental forms in which his universal genius made\r\nhim so preëminent, Mozart’s natural artistic instinct led him most\r\nstrongly to dramatic music. He sought the opera as an opportunity for\r\nhighest artistic endeavor; but other vocal forms he employed, not so\r\nmuch from choice as from the demands of special occasions. Like Haydn,\r\nhe paid but passing attention to the cantata.\r\n\r\n‘King Thamos.’--The foundation of this work by Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart\r\n(1756-91) was an historical drama, ‘Thamos, King of Egypt,’ written\r\nby Freiherr von Gebler. To this Mozart composed the incidental music,\r\nconsisting of five entr’actes and three majestic choruses. The music\r\nwas written in 1779 and 1780 at Salzburg; the work was presented a few\r\ntimes there under the direction of Boehm and Schikaneder and then was\r\nshelved. However, Mozart utilized some of the music by setting the\r\nchoruses to Latin and German words, in which form they were used in the\r\nchurch service as hymns and motets. They are known to musicians now\r\nby the names _Splendente te Deus_, _Deus tibi laus et honor_, and _Ne\r\npulvis et cinis_. Though a feeling of great solemnity pervades them,\r\ntheir original theatrical purpose cannot be entirely concealed behind\r\ntheir adopted sacred words.\r\n\r\n_Davidde Penitente._--This cantata originated in Mozart’s vow, made\r\nbefore his marriage with Constance Weber, to write a mass to celebrate\r\nher arrival at Salzburg as his wife. The ‘half-mass’ which he actually\r\nwrote for this occasion comprised only the Kyrie, Gloria, Sanctus, and\r\nBenedictus, the rest being supplied from an earlier mass. The work\r\nwas given in this form at St. Peter’s Church, August 25, 1783, his\r\nwife taking the solo part. Early in 1785 Mozart received a commission\r\nto write a cantata for a Viennese festival; being short of time, he\r\ntook the Kyrie and Gloria from the above mass, expanded them into five\r\nmovements, added four new ones, and fitted them all out with Italian\r\ntexts selected from the Psalms of David. In this form the work was\r\npresented at the Burg Theater, March 13th, under the title _Davidde\r\nPenitente_. It contains ten numbers, consisting of choruses, soprano\r\nand tenor arias and a terzetto, the tenth number, a final chorus and\r\nfugue, being called the ‘queen of vocal fugues’ by the critics of\r\nthe time. This cantata is regarded as one of the finest examples of\r\nMozart’s church style, notwithstanding the brilliant character of the\r\nsolo parts, especially the bravura aria for soprano (_Fra le oscure\r\nombre_).\r\n\r\nThe Masonic Cantatas.--Mozart became a Mason soon after he arrived in\r\nVienna in 1784 and he entered into the activities of the fraternity\r\nwith great ardor. The following year he composed a small cantata, _Die\r\nMaurerfreude_ (‘The Mason’s Joy’), for tenor and chorus, in honor of\r\nthe master of his lodge, Herr Born. The second Masonic cantata,[63]\r\n_Lob der Freundschaft_ (‘Praise of Friendship’), was finished November\r\n15th, 1791, only three weeks before his death. This work, which is on\r\na larger scale than its predecessor, but less earnest in spirit, is\r\npleasing and popular and consists of six numbers--two choruses, two\r\nrecitatives, a tenor aria, and a duet. It was Mozart’s last completed\r\ncomposition. Two days after its performance at his lodge his last\r\nillness attacked him.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                   VI\r\n\r\nIn the second period of Anglican Church music, beginning after the\r\nrestoration of the Stuarts in 1660, a distinct change in the character\r\nof anthem-writing is discernible. This was inaugurated by Pelham\r\nHumfrey (1647-1674), whose foreign study under Lulli and later in Italy\r\nbrought him in touch with the greater freedom of the operatic style.\r\nIn his church music and that of his immediate successors there is\r\nnoticeable greater variety of plan and detail, more daring harmonies,\r\nmore easy grace in the flow of voice-parts, and in general a faint\r\necho at least of the brilliance reflected from the stage. The Italian\r\nart of solo-singing began to force its way into the domain of church\r\nmusic, adding relief and contrast to the severity of the old motet type\r\nof ‘full’ anthem. This style culminated in Henry Purcell (1658-1695),\r\nprobably the most gifted and certainly the most versatile genius that\r\nEnglish music has produced. In his hands the modern form of the anthem,\r\nas differentiated from the old motet, became clearly defined. Purcell,\r\ntrained in the Chapel Royal and himself a ‘most distinguished singer,’\r\ngave large emphasis to the ‘verse’ and ‘solo’ anthems, and these grew\r\nrapidly in favor. Although an operatic composer of profound ability,\r\nin many respects far in advance of his time, his religious music shows\r\nno trace of undue influence from this secular source, and many of his\r\nanthems[64] and ‘services’ are still cherished as among the finest\r\nexamples of English church music of any period.\r\n\r\nDuring the latter part of the seventeenth century instrumental music\r\nin England took on new importance, and its influence was felt in all\r\nbranches of the art. Orchestral instruments were frequently employed in\r\nthe ritual-music in addition to the organ, which instrument, it should\r\nbe added, was far behind the German organ of this period in mechanical\r\ndevelopment and technical possibilities. Purcell wrote trumpet parts\r\nto his celebrated Te Deum and composed as many as twenty anthems\r\nwith orchestra (besides over thirty with organ). His instrumental\r\naccompaniments began to assume quite independent outlines and his\r\nchoruses were of such fine workmanship that Handel, who was thoroughly\r\nacquainted with his church music, gladly acknowledged his indebtedness\r\nto him. Other noted composers of anthems of this period were Dr. John\r\nBlow (1648-1708), William Croft (1678-1727), and Jeremiah Clarke\r\n(1670-1707), all of whom were choristers in the Chapel Royal and were\r\nbrought up and trained in the atmosphere of the cathedral service.\r\n\r\nNo accession to the form of the anthem has been made since the\r\nbeginning of the eighteenth century. All the forms now in use--the\r\nfull, the verse, the solo--were well established in the public esteem\r\nand the old unaccompanied style had been permanently abandoned in favor\r\nof instrumental accompaniment. The eighteenth century was a period\r\nof general religious and intellectual apathy and this condition of\r\nthought brooded over English church-music. After the spontaneous and\r\nmelodious Purcell, the compositions of the best church musicians of the\r\neighteenth and first half of the nineteenth centuries (constituting\r\nthe third period of English church-music) sound dry and perfunctory,\r\nalthough admirable in construction and solid and worthy in content.\r\nIf we except the Te Deums and anthems of Handel, this period presents\r\nnothing of striking worth. The composers of this period, the best of\r\nwhose anthems are still to be found in the repertory of present-day\r\nchoirs, include Maurice Greene (1696?-1755), William Hayes (1706-1777),\r\nWilliam Boyce (1710-1779), and Jonathan Battishill (1738-1801), whose\r\n‘Call to Remembrance’ is a work of eminent beauty, modern in conception\r\nbeyond its time.\r\n\r\nEnglish psalmody of the eighteenth century, both among the\r\nNon-conformists and in the Established Church, had likewise fallen\r\ninto melancholy ways. Although the good old solid psalm-tunes were\r\nstill in the Psalters, the interest in them declined, the number in\r\nactual use gradually dwindled, the singing became dry and perfunctory,\r\nand the curious custom of ‘lining out’ the psalms became general.\r\nEspecially in the Non-conformist services frivolous tunes were employed\r\nwhich smacked of the Italian opera style; and vocal flourishes were\r\nintroduced in which several tones would be sung to a single syllable.\r\nBut in the Church of England the gradual rise of the hymn to an\r\nindependent place in the Psalter at the very beginning of the century\r\nserved to keep alive the pure flame of sacred song and to inaugurate\r\nthe long-delayed period of real English hymnody, a full century and a\r\nhalf after the corresponding outburst of sacred song among the Germans.\r\nGawthorn’s _Harmonica Perfecta_ of 1730 included a large portion of\r\nthe fine psalm-tunes of the Ravenscroft Psalter, together with some\r\nolder ones and many new ones. These new hymn-tunes were in the main\r\nas solid and satisfying as the best of the old psalm-tunes, yet with\r\nmore rhythmic freedom. The Church of England, however, was slow to\r\ngive full recognition to the hymn, the first church hymn-book for\r\ngeneral use (Madan’s ‘Collection of Psalms and Hymns,’ better known\r\nas the Lock Hospital Collection) not being published until 1769. The\r\ndevotional hymns of Watts and Doddridge were just beginning to reach\r\nthe public heart, when they received a magnificent accession from\r\nthe Wesleyan movement, which, starting in the middle of the century,\r\ntook full advantage of the liberty of worship newly conferred upon\r\nnon-conformists and brought into English religious life something\r\nof the enthusiasm of the old German Reformation days. A revival of\r\nspiritual life took place in sections of England that let loose a great\r\ncreative force of sacred verse and song, which operated not only to\r\nswell the ranks of Methodism with converts whose hearts were filled\r\nwith exuberant song, but to bring into England real congregational\r\nsinging and into English hymnody some of its richest gems of sacred\r\nlyrics. Thus the century closed with a distinct uplift in the religious\r\nsong of the people, which did not bear full fruit in the Church of\r\nEngland, however, till the dawning years of the next century.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                   VII\r\n\r\nAfter the glories of the Palestrina epoch, in which all forms of\r\necclesiastical music attained their highest point of perfection, the\r\nmotet led a rather checkered existence. The English contemporaries of\r\nthe great Roman had cultivated it with such success that the _cantiones\r\nsacræ_ (collections of Latin motets) of Tallis and Byrd are held to be\r\nsecond only to those of Palestrina himself. We have seen that the full\r\nanthem with English words superseded the Latin motet in the service of\r\nthe Anglican Church, but, though the name was changed, the true motet\r\nstyle persisted until the Restoration; indeed, many of the anthems\r\nwere actually written as Latin motets and afterward adapted to English\r\nwords, as, for example, Byrd’s _Civitas sancti tui_, which is always\r\nsung to the words ‘Bow thine ear, O Lord.’ The last of the great motet\r\nwriters in the Roman school were Vittoria, Morales, the two Anerios,\r\nthe two Naninis, Luca Marenzio, and Suriano, all of whom closely\r\napproached the excellence of Palestrina’s superb motets; Orlandus\r\nLassus sustained the reputation of the Netherlanders throughout his\r\nlong career; while in Venice Willaert, de Rore, the two Gabrielis, and\r\nGiovanni Croce, the greatest of this school, produced compositions\r\nof wonderful delicacy and beauty. But after the first quarter of the\r\nseventeenth century the splendor of motet-writing disappeared. The\r\nsolidity and grandeur of the old style of mass, motet, and madrigal\r\nwere thoroughly undermined by the secularity of the monodic style,\r\nwhich now became all-pervasive. The same influences, in slightly\r\nvarying degrees, crept into Catholic and Protestant church music\r\nalike. The rapid development of instrumental music toward the latter\r\npart of this century brought about the abandonment of unaccompanied\r\nmotets in favor of those with instrumental accompaniment, and at the\r\nsame time the modern major and minor keys gradually supplanted the\r\nold ecclesiastical modes. In Italy the best composers--Alessandro\r\nScarlatti, Pergolesi, Durante, Leo, and others--strove earnestly to\r\nreconcile the new style with church ideals and succeeded in producing\r\neffective works, though by no means always churchly.\r\n\r\nThe strongest motet writing of the eighteenth century, however,\r\nflourished in Germany. Many of the motets of the early German\r\nProtestant composers were simple polyphonic adaptations of chorales,\r\nand in the seventeenth century a simple, often trivial, style\r\nprevailed, but in the opening years of the eighteenth century a group\r\nof composers appeared who strove to revive the solid, elaborate style\r\nof the earlier masters. Beginning with Reinhard Keiser (1674-1739) and\r\ncontinued by Karl Heinrich Graun (1701-1759) and Johann Adolph Hasse\r\n(1699-1783), a Catholic composer of attractive style, this movement\r\nculminated in Sebastian Bach (1685-1750), who clothed the motet in all\r\nthe dignity and elaborateness of the old sixteenth century period.\r\nHis motets represent the most perfect type of unaccompanied music in\r\nthe Protestant church-service, as Palestrina’s do in the Roman, and\r\nin their way are quite as incomparable. Bach wrote about 200 motets,\r\namong the best-known of which are _Komm, Jesu, komm_ (‘Come, Jesu,\r\ncome’), _Jesu, meine Freude_ (‘Jesu, priceless treasure’), _Nun ist\r\ndas Heil_ (‘Now shall the grace’), and _Singet dem Herrn_ (‘Sing ye to\r\nthe Lord’). A score of others equally fine might easily be mentioned.\r\nThe motets of Handel, which have only in recent years been snatched\r\nfrom obscurity by the German Handel Society, are works of transcendent\r\nbeauty, full of youthful vigor and strength, and worthy of his best\r\nperiod.\r\n\r\nThe madrigal also participated in the common ruin that befell the\r\nold polyphonic style, and after 1620 the true madrigal practically\r\ndisappeared. In Italy it was displaced by the interest in the new\r\nchamber-cantata; it was wholly forgotten in Flanders and France;\r\nin England it merged into the glee; and in Germany the rise of the\r\npart-song compensated somewhat for its disappearance.\r\n\r\n\r\n      [Illustration: St. Thomas’ Church, Leipzig, in Bach’s Time]\r\n                       _From on old print_\r\n\r\n\r\nThe glee[65] is a form peculiar to England, having a certain\r\nnative folk-song flavor and quite impossible of transplantation; no\r\nother country except, to a degree, America, has bestowed on it any\r\nattention at all. A whole century separates its appearance from the\r\ndecline of the madrigal. The intervening transitional style is well\r\nillustrated by the lovely canzonets of Thomas Ford (about 1580-1648),\r\nsuch as ‘Since first I saw your face’ and ‘There is a Ladie sweete and\r\nkind,’ which breathe something of the spirit of both madrigal and glee.\r\nUnlike the madrigal, the glee is always sung by solo voices, usually\r\nmale, of which there are at least three, but, like the madrigal, it is\r\nalways unaccompanied. The first glees were produced in the early years\r\nof the eighteenth century, and the period of its finest achievement\r\nincludes the years between 1750 and 1825, a period which is almost\r\nexactly contemporaneous with the long life of the greatest master\r\nof this form, Samuel Webbe (1740-1816). The more obvious traits of\r\nthe glee that distinguish it from the madrigal are (1) the modern\r\nmajor and minor system of keys instead of ecclesiastical modes, (2)\r\nabsence of conscious contrapuntal development in the treatment of the\r\nvoice-parts and the consequent frequent employment of chord-masses,\r\n(3) short phrases with frequent full cadences, and (4) greater freedom\r\nin changes of rhythm and rate of speed. Notwithstanding these general\r\ncharacteristics, there are many real glees, such as Stevens’ ‘Ye\r\nspotted snakes,’ that exhibit a high quality of melodic development,\r\nsustained power, and constructional design. While not intended to be\r\ncontrapuntal, the glee maintains a high degree of melodic independence\r\namong the parts, so that the impression given is that of several\r\ninterweaving melodies. Among the finest specimens of glees are ‘When\r\nwinds breathe soft,’ ‘The mighty conqueror,’ ‘Come live with me,’ and\r\n‘Hence, all ye vain delights’ by Samuel Webbe; ‘Ye spotted snakes,’\r\n‘Blow, blow, thou winter wind,’ and ‘Sigh no more, ladies’ by Richard\r\nStevens (1757-1837); ‘By Celia’s arbour,’ ‘Mine be a cot,’ and ‘Cold is\r\nCadwallo’s tongue’ by William Horsley (1774-1858). In addition to the\r\nabove the principal glee composers are: John Wall Calcott (1766-1821),\r\nThomas Attwood (1765-1838), Jonathan Bittishill (1738-1801), Benjamin\r\nCooke (1734-1793), John Danby (1757-1798), Reginald Spoffarth\r\n(1770-1827), and Sir Henry Bishop (1786-1855).\r\n\r\nWhile in a strict sense all the vocal forms thus far mentioned are\r\npart-songs, in choral literature this term is restricted to apply only\r\nto those unaccompanied vocal compositions in which one melody stands\r\nout conspicuously, all the others being more in the nature of harmonic\r\nbackground. In this respect it differs sharply from the glee, though in\r\ngeneral musical mood the two forms may be very similar. The part-song\r\nhas its origin in Germany, where from early times the custom prevailed\r\nof giving simple harmonic setting to the folk-songs,[66] usually note\r\nagainst note. Modelled largely after the harmonized folk-songs, secular\r\npart-songs in profusion were written by German composers, particularly\r\nafter the decline of the madrigal. As an importation from Germany the\r\npart-song was heartily welcomed in England, where it was cultivated\r\nside by side with the madrigal, the two forms often presenting many\r\npoints of similarity and constantly reacting on each other. The great\r\nmadrigalists wrote many such compositions (which they frequently called\r\ncanzonets) on the borderland between the two forms. Such are Morley’s\r\n‘My bonny lass she smileth’ and ‘Now is the month of Maying,’ and\r\nthe canzonets of Thomas Ford mentioned above. The eighteenth-century\r\npart-song in England is, on the whole, unimportant; in Germany its\r\nchief value after 1800 lay in the incentive and impetus it gave to the\r\nformation of numerous choral societies and in the resultant diffusion\r\nof choral culture. The real glories of the part-song belong to the\r\nnineteenth century. Before that period the three principal secular _a\r\ncappella_ vocal forms may be thus briefly characterized: the madrigal,\r\nas the secular counterpart of the motet, is modal and contrapuntal; the\r\nglee is harmonic, devoid of strict counterpoint, but all the voices are\r\nmelodically interesting; the part-song is harmonic, but concentrates\r\nthe melodic interest in one part, usually the highest.\r\n\r\nBefore passing to the consideration of nineteenth-century choral\r\nmusic, it remains to give brief mention to two other forms, the masque\r\nand the ode, both of which are characteristically English and belong\r\nessentially to the seventeenth century. The masque occupied a place\r\nmidway between the cantata and the opera, and enjoyed great popularity\r\nat court and among the aristocratic classes as a kind of private\r\nentertainment from the time of the early Tudors to the Civil War.\r\nOriginally an importation from Italy, it received special development\r\nat the hands of the best English poets--Ben Jonson, Fletcher, Chapman,\r\nCampion, Milton, and others. It was an elaborate dramatic entertainment\r\nbased on some mythological or allegorical subject, calling for\r\ndialogue, declamation, airs, madrigals, much dancing, and gorgeous\r\nscenery and costume, and performed for the most part by personages of\r\nhigh rank in disguise, whence the name. The best English composers of\r\nthe seventeenth century gave their talents to the writing of masque\r\nmusic--Nicholas Lanier, Matthew Locke, Pelham Humfrey, Henry Purcell,\r\nJohn Eccles, and, in the next century, Dr. Thomas Arne. The ode also\r\nfound much favor with the English seventeenth and eighteenth-century\r\npoets, such as Milton, Dryden, Gray, and Collins, but the composer\r\nwhose name is most closely allied with it is Henry Purcell (about\r\n1658-1695), who alone wrote twenty-nine odes and welcome songs for\r\nvarious public and royal occasions, among them four for St. Cecilia’s\r\nDay festivals and four in consecutive years (1690-1693) for Queen\r\nMary’s birthday. Handel wrote four--‘Alexander’s Feast,’ ‘Ode for St.\r\nCecilia’s Day,’ ‘Birthday Ode,’ and _L’Allegro ed il Penseroso_,[67]\r\ntwo of which have been already analyzed.\r\n\r\n\r\n                              FOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[49] Peri’s first opera, _Dafne_, composed in collaboration with\r\nCaccini, had been privately performed in Florence in 1597 (1594?).\r\n\r\n[50] The success of Cavalieri’s _La Rappresentazione_ was apparently\r\nswallowed up by the greater interest in the success of opera, so that\r\ntwenty years elapsed before a second oratorio was written.\r\n\r\n[51] ‘History of Music,’ Vol. IV, p. 144.\r\n\r\n[52] ‘Oxford History of Music,’ Vol. III, p. 153.\r\n\r\n[53] The library of the Paris Conservatoire alone possesses eight\r\nvolumes of his cantatas in MS.\r\n\r\n[54] Grove’s ‘Dictionary of Music and Musicians,’ Art. ‘Scarlatti,’ by\r\nE.

The Netherland period of vocal polyphony spanned\r\ntwo full centuries; the next century and a half was concerned with the\r\nfirst stage in the development of dramatic music and oratorio, and\r\nwith the application of polyphonic principles to instrumental forms;\r\nthe period of seventy-five years between 1750 and 1825 was memorable\r\nchiefly by the appearance and swift development of the sonata and\r\nsymphony from Haydn to Beethoven, with occasional premonitions of\r\nimpending revolutionary changes; the half-century from 1825 to 1875\r\nwitnessed the rise and full flowering of the remarkable movement of\r\nnineteenth-century romanticism; in the years since 1875 new ideas and\r\ntendencies, unfolded from the preceding period, have crowded upon the\r\nmusical arena in such profusion and with such swiftness and persistence\r\nthat intelligent orientation is beset with perplexing difficulties. The\r\n‘youngest of the arts,’ so backward and slow of speech in its infancy,\r\ncertainly displays unmistakable symptoms of precocity with advancing\r\nyears.\r\n\r\nFrom the above statement of the approximate duration of the general\r\nperiods of musical progress it will be noted that the nineteenth\r\ncentury is divisible into three periods, the first of which merely\r\ncarried to completion the classical methods of the preceding century.\r\nBut, while instrumental music responded promptly and vigorously and\r\nwith far-reaching results to the novel ideals of romanticism, choral\r\nmusic was far more conservative. It exhibited the utmost reserve toward\r\nthe new influences, and for several decades after these had brought\r\nenrichment and expansion to instrumental forms, it admitted them only\r\nwith a certain timidity, so that on the whole the effective invasion\r\nof choral music by romanticism was delayed a full half-century after\r\nit had taken possession of instrumental fields. This retardation of\r\nchoral progress is due largely to the natural limitations of the human\r\nvoice, which is confronted with obvious difficulties when attempting\r\nto adopt for its own peculiar purposes the instrumental standpoint\r\nof unrestrained liberty in the use of melodic intervals and harmonic\r\nprogressions. Choral forms have generally proved to be far less\r\nelastic than instrumental forms, and have had to contend with the\r\ntendency toward inertia inherited from their early association with\r\necclesiastical traditions--traditions from which the development\r\nof instrumental music has been notably free. Hence, a much longer\r\nperiod was required in choral music than in instrumental music for\r\nreadjustment to the new viewpoint which nineteenth-century romanticism\r\ninjected into the whole fabric of art-methods, and the choral\r\nliterature of the century falls into only two periods. The great\r\nmajority of the choral works--particularly the smaller choral works--of\r\nthe first two thirds of the century at least are characterized by\r\ngeneral conformity with the classical methods of Handel, Haydn,\r\nand Mozart; where romantic influences are admitted they express\r\nthemselves in terms of greater harmonic warmth and richness, freer\r\nmelodic outlines, and a more marked avoidance of the older special\r\ncontrapuntal devices in favor of more direct mood-painting and detailed\r\ncharacterization of the text, but the classical forms and methods are\r\nquite uniformly retained.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                   I\r\n\r\nBeethoven’s (1770-1827) contribution to the literature of choral music\r\nwas relatively small and the most significant part of it was made in\r\nthe larger forms, as might be expected of a composer possessed of\r\nsuch mighty intellectual endowments. Of the smaller works, two only\r\nare selected for detailed comment. The others include ‘Calm Sea and\r\nProsperous Voyage’ (to Goethe’s poem) for mixed chorus and orchestra,\r\nwritten in 1815, and ‘King Stephen, Hungary’s First Benefactor,’ a\r\nprologue in one act with overture and choruses, the music for which was\r\ncomposed in 1811 to the text by Kotzebue for the same occasion as ‘The\r\nRuins of Athens.’\r\n\r\n‘The Ruins of Athens.’--The music to an allegorical poem with this\r\ntitle by Kotzebue was written in 1811 for the opening of a new theatre\r\nat Pesth, Hungary, which took place February 9, 1812. The story of the\r\npoem is as follows: Minerva, having incurred the wrath of Jove, has\r\nbeen fettered by him with chains ever since the Golden Age within a\r\nrock through which neither the inquiry of man nor the wisdom of the\r\ngoddess could penetrate. Finally Jove relents and releases the goddess.\r\nMinerva then hastens to her beloved Athens, only to find it in ruins\r\nand her art debased. She turns sadly away and proceeds to Pesth, where\r\nshe establishes her temple in the new theatre and presides over a\r\ntriumphal procession in honor of the emperor, its patron, who is to\r\nrestore again the Golden Age. The work was presented a second time in\r\nBeethoven’s lifetime at the opening of a new theatre in Vienna in 1822.\r\nThis time it was with a new text by Carl Meisl entitled _Die Weihe des\r\nHauses_ (‘Dedication of the House’), and it was for this occasion that\r\nBeethoven composed the overture, which is still frequently performed.\r\nThe music consists of eight numbers. The overture is very light and\r\ndeemed even by his friends to be unworthy of the master. The weird,\r\nfervid chorus of the Dervishes for male voices in unison and the\r\nstirring Turkish March are strongly Oriental in color and treatment.\r\nThey are strong and effective numbers, as is also the triumphal march\r\nand chorus ‘Twine ye a garland.’\r\n\r\n‘The Glorious Moment.’--September, 1814, brought to Vienna many\r\npotentates and distinguished statesmen for the Vienna Congress, which\r\nmet to adjust the claims of the European states after the allies had\r\nentered Paris. The occasion was a momentous one and was celebrated\r\nwith great pomp by the Viennese authorities. Beethoven was requested\r\nto write for the greeting of the royal guests a cantata, the words of\r\nwhich had been written by Dr. Aloys Weissenbach of Salzburg. It was\r\ncalled _Der glorreiche Augenblick_ or _Der heilige Augenblick_ (‘The\r\nGlorious Moment’). The time for writing this work was short in itself\r\nand this was much curtailed by disputes between composer and poet,\r\nas Beethoven made every effort to have the atrocious text altered so\r\nas to lend itself better to a musical setting. The work was begun in\r\nSeptember and performed at a concert given for Beethoven’s benefit on\r\nNovember 29th, before a remarkable audience of 6,000 persons. This\r\nconcert, at which was performed also the recently-composed Seventh\r\nSymphony, was a most brilliant affair, and the audience was wildly\r\nenthusiastic, especially for ‘The Glorious Moment,’ which was hailed as\r\nsymbolical of the moment when Europe was to be freed from Napoleonic\r\ndomination. Incidentally, it may be recorded that the composer reaped\r\nmuch substantial advantage from this great occasion, in that, as a\r\nresult, he was able to invest 20,000 marks in shares of the Bank of\r\nAustria. The cantata, which for obvious reasons is not one of his\r\nstrongest, is in six numbers. In 1836 it appeared with a new title,\r\n_Preis der Tonkunst_ (‘The Praise of Music’), with a new poetical text\r\nby Friedrich Rochlitz.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nAmong the composers of the first quarter of the nineteenth century\r\nAndreas Romberg (1767-1821) occupies a worthy place, though not one of\r\nlarge importance. He is the composer of five operas, ten symphonies,\r\ntwenty violin concertos, etc., now forgotten, much church music, and\r\nseveral cantatas. The ‘Lay of the Bell’ (_Das Lied von der Glocke_) was\r\nthe most widely known of all his works, and at present is nearly the\r\nonly one of them to retain any public notice.\r\n\r\n‘The Lay of the Bell.’--Schiller’s famous poem with this title forms\r\nthe text to which Romberg composed the music of this cantata in 1808.\r\nDuring the last half of the nineteenth century it enjoyed great\r\npopularity with the smaller choruses in England, Germany, and America,\r\nand is still frequently heard. The work rehearses the various steps in\r\nthe making of the bell, from lighting the furnace-fire and mixing the\r\nmetals to the casting of the bell and the breaking of the mold by the\r\nmaster. Each step is used as the basis for the description of scenes\r\nwhich the bell will witness in its life among the people--scenes of\r\nyouth, young manhood, and old age, of joy and love and sorrow--all the\r\nintimate experiences that make up human life. The music is written for\r\nmixed chorus, with soprano, tenor, and bass solos, and, while it lacks\r\nthe harmonic warmth and variety of the cantatas written later under\r\nthe glow of the romantic spirit, it is full of interest and animation,\r\nthough light in style throughout.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                   II\r\n\r\nAs the founder of the German romantic movement, Weber (1786-1826) was\r\nan intense nationalist, and his stirring music, folk-song in character\r\nand wholly German in feeling, had a profound political influence in\r\nfanning the flame of national and patriotic sentiment that sprang into\r\nexistence during the period of Napoleonic oppression. His inspiring\r\nsettings of the patriotic poems in Körner’s _Leyer und Schwert_, for\r\nmale voices, made him the idol of the students and young nationalists,\r\nand _Der Freischütz_, the first German opera, created a perfect furor\r\nof patriotic feeling. His first cantata was _Der erste Ton_, written in\r\n1808 for declamation, chorus, and orchestra. Other choral works were\r\nthe cantata _Natur und Liebe_ (‘Nature and Love’) for two sopranos, two\r\ntenors, and two basses with pianoforte accompaniment, composed in 1818,\r\nand the hymn _In seiner Ordung schafft der Herr_ (‘In constant order\r\nworks the Lord’) for solos, chorus, and orchestra, written in 1812.\r\n\r\n‘Jubilee Cantata.’--Weber was commissioned by Count Vitzthum in 1818\r\nto write a grand jubilee cantata for a court concert commemorating\r\nthe fiftieth anniversary of the reign of Friedrich August, king of\r\nSaxony, on the 20th of September. The text was written by the poet\r\nFriedrich Kind. Before it was completed, however, he was informed\r\nthat the work would not be required and that other plans had been\r\nmade. It has been intimated that this change came about through the\r\nintrigues of his Italian rivals (he was then Court Musical Director at\r\nDresden). The cantata, however, was given in the Neustadt church for\r\nthe benefit of the needy peasants in the Hartz Mountains, with Weber\r\nhimself as conductor. While it is said that a _Jubel_ overture by\r\nWeber was performed at the court concert, it is believed by the best\r\nauthorities that the famous _Jubel_ overture, now known the world over,\r\nwas entirely independent of the cantata and of later composition. As\r\nthe original text dealt with events in the life of the king, the work\r\nwas unsuited for general performance, hence a second text was later\r\nsupplied by Amadeus Wendt and the title changed to _Ernte-Cantate_\r\n(‘Harvest Cantata’). This is the version in common use at the present\r\ntime. Still another text was made by Hampdon Napier, and this was given\r\nin London under the title of ‘The Festival of Peace’ shortly before\r\nWeber’s death, the composer himself conducting. The cantata is written\r\nfor four solo voices, chorus, and orchestra. Joy at the fullness of the\r\nharvest alternates with solemn thanksgiving and praise to the Giver\r\nof all good for His bounty. A devotional spirit prevails throughout,\r\nexcept in the ‘storm’ chorus, where a dramatic style appears. The\r\nbeautiful number for quartet and chorus, ‘Wreathe into garlands the\r\ngold of the harvest,’ is frequently detached from the cantata and\r\nperformed separately.\r\n\r\n_Kampf und Sieg_ (‘Battle and Victory’).--While Weber was in Munich\r\nin June, 1815, the victory of the allies at Waterloo was announced.\r\nThe city was at once filled with rejoicing and a large crowd gathered\r\nat St. Michael’s Church to hear a _Te Deum_. Weber, who was present,\r\nconceived the idea of a grand cantata to commemorate the victory and\r\nhe laid the matter before the poet Wohlbrück, whom he had met the same\r\nday. Wohlbrück at once shared the composer’s enthusiasm and by the\r\nfirst of August the text was ready. The cantata was brought to a first\r\nperformance in Prague on December 22d and made a deep impression, not\r\nso much by its musical worth as by its appeal to patriotic ardor and by\r\nthe stirring military character of its vivid battle-descriptions. Weber\r\nresorted to the same elements of rather vulgar realism which Beethoven\r\ninvoked in his ‘Wellington’s Victory’--the noises and crash of battle\r\nand national melodies to designate the fighting hosts. Amid the roar of\r\ncannon, the cries of the wounded, and the shouts of the soldiers can\r\nbe heard the revolutionary melody _Ça ira_ from the advancing French,\r\n‘God save the King’ from the English, while the stirring strains of\r\nthe Austrian and Prussian grenadier marches and the refrain from\r\nWeber’s own patriotic song, _Lützow’s wilde Jagd_, swell the volume of\r\ntumultuous sound from the victorious allies. The cantata is written for\r\nfour solo voices, chorus, and orchestra. Faith (bass), Love (soprano),\r\nand Hope (tenor) appear in the lyrical portions of the work; the middle\r\nsection is given over entirely to the battle scene and the whole closes\r\nwith a stately chorus, _Herr Gott, Dich loben wir_.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nWhile Franz Schubert (1797-1828) essayed nearly every musical form,\r\nit is as the creator and perfecter of the German art-song that he\r\ntakes his place among the great and mighty ones of music. His supreme\r\ngift as a melodist and song-writer is at once apparent in all of his\r\nworks. In choral fields he wrote considerable church music and several\r\nsmaller works, of which the only one of large importance is _Miriam’s\r\nSiegesgesang_ (‘The Song of Miriam’). Among the others are the\r\nNinety-second Psalm for baritone solo and mixed chorus (written in 1828\r\nfor the synagogue at Vienna); the Twenty-third Psalm for four voices\r\n(quartet, or male or female chorus) with pianoforte accompaniment,\r\neasy, grateful and song-like in character; two hymns, _Herr unser Gott_\r\nand _An dem Heiligen Geist_, the latter for eight-part male chorus\r\nand orchestra; and _Glaube, Hoffnung und Liebe_ (‘Faith, Hope, and\r\nCharity’) for mixed chorus and wood-wind instruments, written in 1816.\r\n\r\n_Miriam’s Siegesgesang._--This noble cantata, known in English as\r\n‘The Song of Miriam’ or ‘Miriam’s War Song,’ was composed by Schubert\r\nin March, 1828, the last year of his short life. It was written for\r\nsoprano solo and chorus to Grillparzer’s lines paraphrasing the part of\r\nthe sixteenth chapter of Exodus that sets forth Miriam’s thanksgiving\r\nfor the escape of the Israelites and the people’s song of triumph\r\nas they rejoice over their own deliverance and the destruction of\r\nthe pursuing Egyptians. Schubert left it with only a pianoforte\r\naccompaniment, though intending to score it for orchestra. What death\r\nprevented him from doing was supplied a year or two later by his friend\r\nFranz Lachner, who at the time was kapellmeister at the Kärnthnerthor\r\nTheatre in Vienna. The date of its first performance is in doubt.\r\nNottebohm gives it as January 30, 1829, the occasion being a benefit\r\nconcert to raise funds for a monument in memory of the composer. A\r\nspirited solo and chorus (‘Strike the cymbals’) opens the work. This\r\nis followed by a graceful song in which the Lord is described as a\r\nshepherd leading his people out of Egypt. In the next number the awe of\r\nthe Israelites is depicted as they pass unharmed through the divided\r\nwaters, while Pharaoh’s hosts are engulfed behind them. The sea becomes\r\ncalm again and the first chorus is repeated, closing with a majestic\r\nfugue (‘Mighty is the Lord at all times’). Though the cantata is short,\r\nit is replete with passages of enduring charm.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nLudwig Spohr (1784-1859), the celebrated violinist and composer of\r\ninstrumental music and operas in a style intermediate between the old\r\nclassical and the new romantic schools, left much choral music which,\r\nhowever, has quite largely lost its early vogue. In the shorter forms\r\nare three psalms for solos and double chorus; the Twenty-fourth Psalm\r\nfor solos and chorus with pianoforte; the One Hundred and Twenty-eighth\r\nPsalm for solos and chorus with organ or pianoforte; the Eighty-fourth\r\nPsalm (Milton) for solos, chorus, and orchestra; two hymns--‘St.\r\nCecilia’ for soprano solo and chorus, and ‘God, thou art great’ (_Gott,\r\ndu bist gross_) for solos, chorus, and orchestra; and a patriotic\r\ncantata, _Das befreite Deutschland_ (‘Free Germany’).\r\n\r\n\r\n                                   III\r\n\r\nFelix Mendelssohn-Bartholdy (1809-1847) was the first composer since\r\nHandel to rival him in the mastery of choral forms. Gifted and genial\r\nas he is in other fields, it is here that he has left the most enduring\r\nevidence of his genius. His fine contrapuntal training and his splendid\r\nmastery over all the technical resources of polyphonic writing made\r\nchoral forms especially agreeable to his natural and developed gifts.\r\nIn general form his choral works follow Handelian models, but his\r\nmelodies are far more glowing and his harmonies far richer and of\r\nwarmer texture. Most of his smaller choral works fall under the head\r\nof church music. These comprise several anthems and other ritual-music\r\nfor the Anglican service, the fruit of his long and intimate relations\r\nwith English musical life, some fine motets (especially the three\r\nfor female voices written in 1830 for the convent of _Trinità de’\r\nMonti_ in Rome, namely, _Veni Domine_, _Laudate Pueri_, and _Surrexit\r\nPastor_, and the great eight-part motet, ‘Judge me, O God’), several\r\ncompositions for the Berlin Cathedral, hymns, and nine psalms. He is\r\nthe first composer in the nineteenth century to give to the psalm the\r\nsame breadth and seriousness of treatment accorded to the larger choral\r\nforms. They rise to the dignity of important works, though all are not\r\nequally beautiful. They are: Psalms 115 (‘Not unto us, O Lord’) and 95\r\n(‘O come let us worship’) for solos, chorus, and orchestra; Psalm 114\r\n(‘When Israel out of Egypt came’) for eight-part chorus and orchestra;\r\nPsalm 98 (‘Sing to the Lord’) for eight-part chorus and orchestra,\r\nwritten for the festival service in the Berlin Cathedral on New Year’s\r\nDay, 1844; Psalm 42 (‘As the hart pants’) for soprano solo, chorus,\r\nand organ; Psalms 2, 22, and 47 for eight-part _a cappella_ chorus,\r\nwritten for the Berlin Cathedral; and Psalm 13 (‘Lord, how long wilt\r\nThou forget me’) for alto solo and chorus. The 42d and 95th are the\r\nfinest of the psalms; the others are seldom performed now. The hymn,\r\n‘Hear my prayer,’ for soprano solo, chorus, and organ, closing with\r\nthe familiar ‘O for the wings of a dove,’ is one of the most beautiful\r\nof Mendelssohn’s devotional inspirations, and has enjoyed, and still\r\nenjoys, great popularity with both choirs and choral societies.\r\n\r\n‘The First Walpurgis Night.’--While Mendelssohn was travelling in\r\nItaly in 1831 he composed music to Goethe’s poem ‘The First Walpurgis\r\nNight,’ the dramatic intensity of which made a deep impression on the\r\nyoung composer; but it was not until February 2, 1843, that it was\r\npublicly performed at Leipzig, and then much altered from the original\r\ndraft. St. Walpurgis, to whom May-day eve was dedicated, was an early\r\nmissionary who had brought Christianity to the Druids of Saxony.\r\nThe scene of the cantata is the summit of the Brocken and the time\r\nMay-day eve, when the Druids, taking advantage of the old Northern\r\nmyth that on this eve the witches hold high revels here, gather to\r\ncelebrate their rites, while their sentinels, disguised as demons,\r\nscare away the Christians with wild gesticulations, clashes of arms,\r\nand hideous noises. The music belongs to Mendelssohn’s most important\r\nand significant work. The overture, graphically depicting the passage\r\nfrom winter to spring, is followed by a tenor solo and a chorus of\r\nDruids, breathing the atmosphere of spring. Next comes a dramatic\r\nalto solo, uttering a warning, and after it a stately exhortation by\r\nthe Druid priest. There ensues a whispering chorus, portraying the\r\nsentinels as they quietly take their places. A guard then discloses\r\nthe plan for frightening away intruders. This leads to a chorus in\r\nwhich the composer uses most grotesque musical effects, both vocal and\r\ninstrumental, to picture the infernal scene. This weird chaos gives way\r\nto an impressive hymn for bass solo and chorus. Following this comes\r\nthe terrified cry of the Christians, who are driven away, while the\r\nDruids and their priest chant a closing hymn of praise.\r\n\r\n‘As the Hart Pants.’--Mendelssohn’s setting of the Forty-second Psalm\r\nwas first presented at a Gewandhaus concert in Leipzig in 1838. It is\r\nsmaller in form than the ‘Walpurgis Night,’ but is symmetrical and\r\nartistic. A sustained introduction leads to a chorus, tender and full\r\nof passionate longing, ‘As the hart pants after the water brooks, so\r\npanteth my soul for Thee, O God,’ in which the highest point among\r\nthe choral portions of the work is reached. A beautiful adagio melody\r\nis given out by the oboe and repeated as a soprano solo, ‘For my soul\r\nthirsteth for God.’ The third number, ‘My tears have been my meat,’\r\ngiven as a soprano recitative, leads to a march-like chorus for women’s\r\nvoices, ‘For I had gone with the multitude.’ The male voices then sing\r\nin unison ‘Why, my soul, art thou cast down?’ and the female voices\r\nanswer, ‘Trust thou in God.’ A pathetic soprano recitative follows,\r\nbeginning ‘O my God! My soul is cast down within me.’ The eighth number\r\nis sung by a male quartet with string accompaniment, ‘The Lord will\r\ncommand His loving-kindness in the daytime,’ a beautiful response full\r\nof hope and consolation; while through it is heard the saddening strain\r\nof the soprano. The closing full chorus repeats the fourth number,\r\n‘Trust thou in God,’ more elaborately developed, and ending in a pæan\r\nof praise to God. This Psalm-cantata is one of the finest as well as\r\nmost frequently performed of Mendelssohn’s shorter choral works and\r\nbreathes throughout a deeply religious feeling couched in terms of\r\nrefined romantic sentiment.\r\n\r\n‘Come Let Us Sing’ (95th Psalm).--The first performance of this psalm,\r\nwhich is written for tenor solo, chorus, and orchestra, took place at\r\nLeipzig on February 21, 1839. It opens with a solo, ‘O come, let us\r\nworship,’ the theme of which is immediately taken up and developed by\r\nthe chorus in jubilant tone, but which sinks at the end to a quiet\r\nmood. A solo soprano voice then enunciates the words, ‘Come, let us\r\nsing to the Lord,’ and this theme is treated fugally by the chorus\r\nin a joyous allegro movement, closing with a strong two-part canon\r\nin the octave for the male and female voices. The third number is a\r\ngraceful duet, ‘In His hands,’ for two sopranos, which is followed by\r\na stately fugal chorus, ‘For His is the sea,’ at the end of which the\r\nopening section of the first chorus appears with antiphonal phrases\r\nfor the tenor solo. The original setting closes with the fifth number,\r\n‘Henceforth, when ye hear His voice,’ for solo and chorus, a movement\r\nof fine contrapuntal workmanship, closing with softest tones to the\r\npleading words, ‘Turn not deaf ears and hard hearts.’ An additional\r\nnumber was left by Mendelssohn, written a few weeks after the first\r\nperformance, with the evident purpose of bringing the psalm to a more\r\ncomplete finish. It consists of another choral setting of the words,\r\n‘For His is the sea,’ in which the theme from the first number again\r\nplays an important part and an atmosphere of joy and majestic power is\r\nmaintained throughout.\r\n\r\n_Lauda Sion_ (‘Praise Jehovah’), one of Mendelssohn’s most beautiful\r\ncantatas, for four solo voices, chorus, and orchestra, was written for\r\nthe celebration of the Festival of Corpus Christi by the Church of St.\r\nMartin at Liège, where it was performed June 11, 1846, the composer\r\nhimself being present. The _Lauda Sion_ is a sequence (see page 15)\r\nwritten by Thomas Aquinas about 1264 and is regularly sung at High Mass\r\non this Feast. There is a short introduction and the announcement of\r\nthe theme _Lauda Sion_ leads to a chorus _Laudis thema_, of devotional\r\ncharacter. In the _Sit laus plena_, phrases sung by the soprano are\r\nrepeated by the chorus. Then follows a beautiful quartet, _In hac\r\nmensa_. A solemn chorale in unison leads to a charming soprano arioso,\r\n_Caro cibus_. The seventh and last number is an intensely dramatic solo\r\nand chorus, set to the closing lines of the well-known hymn. This is\r\nMendelssohn’s only excursion into the Catholic liturgy.\r\n\r\n‘The Gutenberg Festival Cantata.’--Mendelssohn wrote this short\r\nfestival cantata for the fourth centennial celebration of the invention\r\nof printing, observed at Leipzig, June 24, 1840, by the unveiling\r\nof Gutenberg’s statue in the public square. The text was written by\r\nAdolphus Prölsz, a teacher in the Gymnasium at Freiberg. A stately\r\nchorale leads to ‘Fatherland! within thy confines,’ a song[68] written\r\nin memory of Gutenberg. Next comes a spirited melody for tenors, ‘And\r\nGod said, \"Let there be Light,\"’ followed by a closing chorale, ‘Now,\r\nthank God all.’\r\n\r\n‘Antigone.’--The incidental music to Sophocles’ _Antigone_ was\r\ncomposed in 1841 in the short space of eleven days, and was privately\r\npresented at Potsdam before William IV of Prussia and his court,\r\nOctober 28. Its first public performance was at Leipzig, March 5, 1842.\r\nIt was written for male chorus and orchestra and consists of seven\r\nnumbers. Although built along modern lines, Mendelssohn’s felicitous\r\nmusic faithfully represents the spirit of the ancient Greek tragedy.\r\n\r\n‘Œdipus at Colonos.’--At the command of the king of Prussia, from whom\r\nMendelssohn had received the commission of chapel-master in 1841, the\r\nmusic to this tragedy by Sophocles was composed in 1843 and its first\r\npresentation took place at Potsdam November 1, 1845. The music, sung by\r\ntwo male choruses antiphonally, embraces nine choral numbers, preceded\r\nby a short introduction. The third number, closing with an invocation\r\nto Neptune by the united choruses, is the gem of the work and has few\r\nequals in effective choral writing. It is frequently heard in detached\r\nform on the concert stage.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                   IV\r\n\r\nThe early romantic movement attracted to itself no more enthusiastic\r\ndisciple and energetic exponent than Hector Berlioz (1803-1869).\r\nIndeed, he was one of the earliest and at the same time one of the most\r\nextreme of the romanticists. Eccentric, impatient of formalism of any\r\nkind, but gifted with an intensely vivid imagination and a prodigious\r\nsense of color, he possessed a creative force of great originality\r\nand spontaneity, whose effectiveness, however, was frequently marred\r\nby its extravagance of expression. Endowed with an insatiable desire\r\nto interline all music with some kind of a descriptive or narrative\r\npurpose, he gave a tremendous impetus to ‘program music.’ In attempting\r\nto find an effective medium for descriptive effort in striving after\r\nthe fantastic, he mightily developed the resources of the orchestra\r\nand became the real founder of the modern science of orchestration;\r\nmoreover, he used his orchestra as eloquently in his choral\r\nmasterpiece, ‘The Damnation of Faust,’ as in his symphonic works.\r\nHis choral-writing came under the same romantic spell of liberation\r\nfrom formalism as did his instrumental inspirations. His ‘Faust’ is\r\nnot only the first choral work, but almost the only one until near\r\nthe end of the nineteenth century, in which the romantic ideal wholly\r\ndominates both choral and instrumental forces. If some of the choral\r\nnumbers suffer in comparison with present-day choral treatment, this\r\nis not because of any difference of viewpoint, but because of the\r\ninadequacy, which one sometimes feels, of the purely musical vocabulary\r\nat his command to express fully what he felt. He frequently used the\r\nchorus, as did Beethoven in the ‘Ninth Symphony,’ as an adjunct to his\r\nsymphonic works, but in distinctly choral forms, he left, in addition\r\nto the ‘Faust’ and the works mentioned in Chapter VIII, the cantata\r\n_La mort de Sardanapale_, which was completed amid the uproar of the\r\nJuly Revolution, 1830, and with which he won the Grand Prix de Rome\r\nthe same year; the cantata _Le cinq mai_ for bass solo, chorus, and\r\norchestra, written in 1834 for the anniversary of Napoleon’s death; the\r\ncantata _L’Impériale_, written in 1855 for the Paris Exhibition; _Sara\r\nla Baigneuse_, a choral ballad; three youthful cantatas, _La révolution\r\ngrecque_ (1826), _Herminie_ (1828), and _La mort de Cléopatre_ (1829);\r\nand a few occasional choruses and choral ballads.\r\n\r\n‘The Damnation of Faust.’--This ‘dramatic legend,’ as the composer\r\ncalls it, is the aftermath of an early and immature work, ‘Eight Scenes\r\nfrom Faust’ (published in 1829 as opus 1), and was composed in 1845\r\nand ‘46, part of it here and there while on a concert tour in Austria\r\nand Hungary, the rest in Paris. Its first performance took place at\r\nthe Opéra-Comique, Paris, December 6, 1846, under the direction of\r\nthe composer, before a wretchedly small audience and without success.\r\nIn Germany it was produced at the Royal Opera House, Berlin, June\r\n19, 1847, Berlioz conducting. Though parts of it were frequently\r\ngiven in England, the first complete performance did not take place\r\nuntil February 5, 1880, at the Free Trade Hall in Manchester, when\r\nCharles Hallé conducted it. In New York a few days later, on February\r\n12th, it had its first American hearing under the direction of Dr.\r\nLeopold Damrosch with the combined Oratorio and Arion Societies. ‘The\r\nDamnation of Faust’ is undoubtedly Berlioz’s masterpiece and sums\r\nup the best qualities of his exuberant and fantastic style. Both\r\ninstrumental and choral parts are overlaid with a wealth of romantic\r\nand poetic coloring, the orchestration is dazzling, and the chorus is\r\nbrilliantly handled. Many of its most beautiful and effective numbers\r\nwere retained almost without alteration from his earlier ‘Eight Scenes\r\nfrom Faust’--the work of a youth of twenty-five years. These include\r\nthe scene where Faust is lulled to sleep by the sylphs, the peasants’\r\nsong, the songs of the rat and the flea, the King of Thule ballad, and\r\nMephistopheles’ serenade.\r\n\r\nThe work, which has the dimensions of an oratorio, is divided into\r\nfour parts, the first of which contains three scenes, the second\r\nfive, the third six, and the fourth six, concluding with a short\r\nepilogue and the apotheosis of Marguerite. The persons represented are\r\nMarguerite (mezzo-soprano), Faust (tenor), Mephistopheles (bass), and\r\nBrander (bass). The story does not closely follow Goethe’s version,\r\nas the opening scene discloses Faust alone at sunrise on a plain in\r\nHungary, where Berlioz places him in order to have the opportunity of\r\nintroducing the Hungarian national march. He sings in tender strain\r\nof the joys of spring and the delights of nature, but his reverie is\r\ndisturbed by a rollicking chorus and dance of peasants. From another\r\npart of the plain come warlike sounds of an advancing army to the\r\nstirring and brilliant music of the Rákóczy March. The troops pass and\r\nFaust retires, unmoved by the scene. The second part opens with Faust\r\nin North Germany, alone in his study. He voices his discontent with\r\nthe world; as he is on the point of drowning his sorrow with poison,\r\nthe tones of the Easter Hymn (‘Christ is risen from the dead’) strike\r\nhis ear. He listens in wonderment to the joyful strains and at the\r\nend joins in the stately chorus. Repentant and exalted, he resolves\r\nto begin anew, when Mephistopheles suddenly appears and mockingly\r\nexclaims, ‘Sweet sentiments indeed and fit for any saint!’ Faust is\r\nentrapped by his promises and they disappear. The next scene finds\r\nthem in Auerbach’s cellar in Leipzig amid a band of carousing students\r\nwho sing a lusty drinking song (‘Oh, it is rare when winter’s storms\r\nare loudly roaring’). There follows the drunken Brander’s song of the\r\nrat, at the end of which the irreverent students improvise an ironical\r\nfugue on the word ‘Amen’ to a motive from the theme of Brander’s song.\r\nMephistopheles adds to the reckless merriment with the song of the flea\r\n(‘Once on a time a king, sirs, loved a flea passing well’). Amid the\r\nheavy bravos of the drunken students, Faust and Mephistopheles vanish,\r\nto appear again in the next scene, the seventh, on the wooded meadows\r\non the banks of the Elbe. Mephistopheles sings a delightful melody\r\n(‘Within these bowers’) and summons the spirits of earth and of air to\r\nlull his companion to sleep. Faust slumbers while the gnomes and sylphs\r\nsing a chorus of ravishing beauty (‘Dream, happy Faust’), closing with\r\nan exquisitely delicate orchestral number in waltz-measure, the dance\r\nof the sylphs. As they disappear, Faust wakes and relates his vision\r\nof Marguerite. Mephistopheles agrees to lead him to her chamber and\r\non the way thither they join a band of jovial soldiers and students\r\nmarching along the street. The last scene of this part consists of\r\na lively soldiers’ chorus (‘Tower and wall may bar our way’) and a\r\ncharacteristic Latin student-song (_Jam nox stellata_), the two being\r\ncleverly combined at the end.\r\n\r\nThe action of the third part takes place in Marguerite’s chamber.\r\nFaust enters and sings passionately of his love for her (‘Oh, come,\r\ncalm breathing twilight’). Mephistopheles warns him of her approach\r\nand hides him behind a curtain. She enters and in detached phrases\r\ntells of her vision of Faust and her love for him. While preparing\r\nfor slumber, she sings the pathetic ballad, ‘Once in far Thule.’ As\r\nits sad strains die away, Mephistopheles summons the evil spirits\r\nand the will-o’-the-wisps to encircle her dwelling and lure her to\r\nher doom. Then follows the lovely dance of the will-o’-the-wisps, an\r\norchestral minuet which Berlioz has enriched with many a masterly touch\r\nof tonal realism. Mephistopheles sings his sardonic serenade (‘Why,\r\nfair maid, wilt thou linger’), with frequent choral accompaniment\r\nby the will-o’-the-wisps, each stanza closing with a derisive ‘Ha!’\r\nA trio (‘O purest maid’) of great dramatic power and passion brings\r\nthis part to a close. Faust and Marguerite avow their mutual love,\r\nMephistopheles warns them of approaching danger, while a chorus of\r\nneighbors in the street taunts the hapless maiden. As the fourth part\r\nopens, Marguerite, alone in her chamber, sings a sad, sweet romance,\r\n‘Alone and heavy-hearted’ (Goethe’s familiar _Meine Ruh’ ist hin_),\r\nat the end of which distant strains of the songs of the soldiers and\r\nstudents are heard. The next scene is Faust’s solemn and powerful\r\ninvocation to Nature (‘Mysterious Nature! vast and relentless power!’).\r\nMephistopheles appears on the rocky scene, relates Marguerite’s crime\r\nand imprisonment, and, playing upon Faust’s desire to rescue her,\r\nmakes him sign the contract that binds his soul to the Evil One. The\r\n‘Ride to the Abyss’ now begins and Berlioz’s furious music, which\r\nonly for one short moment relaxes its impetuous galloping rhythm,\r\npictures with relentless realism the terrible scenes as the riders\r\npass horror-stricken peasants praying at the roadside, as they\r\ndraw into their train monstrous birds, hideous beasts, and leering\r\nskeleton-phantoms. With a shout of triumph from Mephistopheles and a\r\ncry of horror from Faust, they fall into the abyss, where they are\r\ngreeted by a chorus of devils (male voices), who sing in a language\r\ninvented for them by the imaginative Berlioz (_Has! Irimiru Karabrao_,\r\netc.). The glee and triumph of this fiendish host are uttered in\r\nsnarling tones of harshest discord, ‘the hellish laugh of fiends\r\nexulting in their torture.’ These sounds of pandemonium are followed\r\nby a short epilogue ‘On Earth,’ leading into an equally short one ‘In\r\nHeaven,’ in which the seraphim plead for Marguerite. The whole work\r\ncloses with the ‘Apotheosis of Marguerite,’ in which the celestial\r\nchorus (‘Thou ransomed soul, rest from thy sorrow!’) with joyful tones\r\nwelcomes the pardoned maiden to the realms of everlasting light.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                   V\r\n\r\nThe achievements of Robert Schumann (1810-1856) in other fields\r\nfar outshone his choral works, yet the latter are by no means\r\ninconsiderable in number or unimportant in quality and influence. But\r\nhe never mastered the technical details of effective choral-writing as\r\ndid Mendelssohn. Sonorous and glowing as many of his choruses are, his\r\nchoral works, even the finest one, ‘Paradise and the Peri,’ make their\r\nstrongest appeal through the beauty and melodic charm of the solos and\r\ntheir orchestral accompaniments. He wrote nothing that could strictly\r\nbe called church-music though his compositions include a Mass and a\r\nRequiem. Several of his works besides these, however, can be classed\r\nas sacred music. They are the ‘Advent Hymn,’ ‘New Year’s Song,’ and a\r\nmotet (_Verzweifle nicht_) for double male chorus and organ (1849).\r\nHis secular choral works are numerous, the most important of which are\r\ngiven detailed mention below. In addition there are the two ballads by\r\nUhland for solos, chorus, and orchestra, ‘The King’s Son’ and ‘The Luck\r\nof Edenhall’ (for male voices); ‘The Page and the King’s Daughter,’ a\r\nballad by Geibel written for solos, chorus, and orchestra; a beautiful\r\nsetting of Hebbel’s ‘Song of Night’ for chorus and orchestra; and a\r\nnumber of romances and ballads, among the best-known of which is ‘Gypsy\r\nLife.’ He also wrote incidental music to Byron’s ‘Manfred’ and a set\r\nof scenes (grouped into three parts) from Goethe’s ‘Faust,’ the latter\r\nintended, not for stage performance, but for concert. Some portions of\r\nhis ‘Faust’ music are quite equal to ‘Paradise and the Peri’ in melodic\r\nbeauty and in freshness and sustained power of invention, but the work\r\nis uneven, the third part being by far the best.\r\n\r\n‘Paradise and the Peri’ was Schumann’s first venture in the field of\r\nchoral forms with orchestra, yet it is not only his finest choral\r\nwork, but it marks the real beginning of the secular or ‘romantic’\r\noratorio as a form of equal worth and importance with the sacred\r\noratorio. He published it, however, without giving any classifying\r\nname to its form. The constant use of a narrator seems to ally it to\r\npassion-music, as far as its form is concerned, but in other respects,\r\nnotwithstanding its length, it resembles the dramatic secular cantata.\r\nIn treating the narrative parts, however, Schumann abandons the older\r\nform of recitative and gives to these connecting links almost the same\r\nmelodic importance as to the main events of the story themselves, thus\r\nsacrificing an opportunity for much needed contrast among the vocal\r\nelements.\r\n\r\n‘Paradise and the Peri’ was written in 1843 and was given its first\r\nperformance at the Gewandhaus, Leipzig, on December 4th of the same\r\nyear with the composer conducting. England heard the work for the\r\nfirst time June 23d, 1856, with Mme. Jenny Lind-Goldschmidt singing\r\nthe part of the Peri and Sterndale Bennett conducting. Schumann found\r\nhis text in the second poem of Thomas Moore’s ‘Lalla Rookh,’ which he\r\nfollowed very closely. This deals with the beautiful Hindoo legend of\r\nthe fallen Peri, banished from paradise, who is promised readmission\r\nif she succeeds in finding the gift ‘most dear to Heaven.’ She brings\r\nin succession the last drop of blood shed by a hero fighting for his\r\ncountry’s liberty, the last sigh of a devoted maiden who sacrificed\r\nherself to die by the side of her plague-stricken lover, and the tear\r\nof a repentant sinner--which last precious gift alone can move the\r\ncrystal bar that closes the gate of light. These three quests for\r\nthe coveted gift constitute the three parts into which the work is\r\ndivided. The music has many touches of oriental color, but it breathes\r\nthroughout the warm romantic sentiment, in melody and harmony, which\r\nwas an inseparable part of Schumann’s individual style. The work\r\ndiscloses some fine choral-writing, but the composer of _Frauenliebe\r\nund-Leben_ and _Dichterliebe_ is conspicuously apparent in many an\r\nexquisite song, the peers of anything Schumann has written. The persons\r\nrepresented are the Peri (soprano), the angel (alto), the King of Gazna\r\n(bass), the youth (tenor), the maiden (soprano), and the horseman\r\n(baritone); the part of the narrator is distributed among various\r\nvoices. There are choruses of Hindoos, angels, houris, and genii of the\r\nNile.\r\n\r\nAn expressive orchestral introduction is followed by the narrator\r\n(alto), who describes the forlorn Peri at the gate of heaven. The\r\nPeri sings a beautiful melody (‘How blest seem to me, banished child\r\nof air!’), full of tender longing; the angel tells her how she may\r\nagain be admitted (‘One hope is thine’) and the Peri departs on her\r\nquest, singing ‘I know the wealth hidden in every urn.’ The narrator\r\nhere introduces a quartet (‘Oh, beauteous land’), which is immediately\r\nfollowed by a full chorus (‘But crimson now her rivers ran’). A\r\nstirring march-like movement foretells the approach of the tyrant of\r\nGazna; choruses of Hindoos and the conquerors shout defiance at each\r\nother; the narrator (tenor) tells of the solitary youth left fighting\r\nfor his native land; the tyrant and the youth face each other and utter\r\nshort defiant phrases; the youth shoots his last arrow, it misses its\r\nmark and he is slain; and an eight-part chorus cries out in agonized\r\ntones, ‘Woe! for false flew the shaft.’ The Peri saw the deed and flew\r\nto catch the last drop of blood shed for liberty by the youthful hero.\r\nThe part closes with a chorus (‘For blood must be holy’), vigorous,\r\nbroad, exultant, in which the Peri finally joins.\r\n\r\nThe second part opens with a tenderly expressive strain which\r\naccompanies the narrator (tenor) as he tells of the return of the\r\nPeri to heaven’s gate with her gift. A short solo for the angel\r\nfollows (‘Sweet is our welcome’), and the narrator describes the\r\ndisappointment of the Peri. Without any break in the music the scene\r\nsuddenly shifts to the banks of the Nile; the spirits of the river\r\nin a pianissimo chorus weave their dainty strains around the lament\r\nof the Peri (‘O Eden, how longeth for thee my heart’) which rises\r\never higher and higher. The narrator (tenor) describes at length the\r\npestilence that afflicts Egypt’s land. The Peri weeps at the scene and\r\na solo quartet in beautiful phrases sings the magic power of tears.\r\nFrom this point to the end of the second part there is an unbroken\r\nstream of exquisite melody, as the pathetic scene is unfolded of the\r\nfaithful love of the maiden who gladly dies beside her plague-stricken\r\nlover. It contains two of Schumann’s finest lyric inspirations--the\r\nsolo of the mezzo-soprano narrator (‘Poor youth, thus deserted’) and\r\nthe deeply-moving love-song of the dying maiden (‘Oh, let me only\r\nbreathe the air, love!’). The Peri sings a calm, sweet lament over\r\nthe bodies of the lovers (‘Sleep on’), in which the chorus joins, and\r\nthis beautiful part is brought to a reposeful close. A graceful chorus\r\nof houris (‘Wreathe ye the steps to great Allah’s throne’) opens the\r\nthird part, in which chorus a pleasing canon for the first and second\r\nsopranos is given an important place. The narration is taken up by the\r\ntenor (‘Now morn is blushing in the sky’) in very melodious strain. The\r\nangel in a short solo again announces that the gift must be far holier.\r\nThe Peri, full of anguish and disappointment but still not despairing,\r\nin a long aria (‘Rejected and sent from Eden’s door’) voices her\r\ndetermination to find the acceptable gift. The narrator, this time a\r\nbaritone, sings a lengthy but graceful melody (‘And now o’er Syria’s\r\nrosy plain’), followed by a beautiful quartet of Peris (‘Say, is it\r\nso?’). The baritone resumes the narrative, and, after a short solo by\r\nthe Peri, this is continued by a tenor who in a long and stirring song\r\ndescribes a scene in Baalbec’s valley--an innocent child playing amid\r\nthe flowers, a weary, sin-stained horseman who pauses to drink from the\r\nnear-by fountain. The alto narrator pictures the vesper call to prayer\r\nand the child’s instant response. The tenor dwells on the childhood\r\nmemories aroused in ‘the man of sin’ at the sight. The horseman in a\r\nshort but heartfelt strain (‘There was a time, thou blessed child’)\r\nis touched to repentance. A quartet and chorus (‘Oh, blessed tears of\r\ntrue repentance’) take up the theme in simple, full harmony. The Peri\r\nand the tenor narrator describe the scene as the man and the child\r\nkneel side by side in prayer. In the final number the Peri in exultant\r\ntones (‘Joy, joy forever! My work is done’) sings her happiness at\r\nhaving found the acceptable gift, and from a chorus of the blest there\r\nresounds a glad welcome to the redeemed Peri (‘Oh, welcome mid the\r\nblest!’).\r\n\r\n‘The Pilgrimage of the Rose’ was written for solos, chorus, and\r\norchestra in the spring of 1851 and first performed at Düsseldorf, May\r\n6, 1852. It is founded on a fairy tale by Moritz Horn, the uninspiring\r\nand weak text of which is probably responsible for the infrequent\r\nperformance of this cantata, though individual numbers are occasionally\r\ngiven. The narrative calls for eight personages distributed among\r\nthe various voices and there are twenty-four numbers. The rather\r\ncommonplace story relates the wanderings of a rose, who, transformed\r\ninto a lovely maiden, tastes the joys of pure happiness among mortals.\r\nThe rose, which she must always carry with her, she finally gives to\r\nher infant babe, and, as she dies, she is carried away by angels. Among\r\nthe most interesting numbers are the opening song in canon-form for\r\ntwo sopranos (‘Of loving will the token’), the chorus of fairies (‘In\r\ndancing’), a spirited male chorus (‘In the thick wood hast wandered’),\r\nthe duet (‘In the smiling valley’), and the two bridal choruses (‘Why\r\nsound the horns so gaily?’ and ‘And now at the miller’s’).\r\n\r\n‘The Minstrel’s Curse,’ a work for solo voices, chorus, and orchestra,\r\nwas written and first performed in 1852. It presents the familiar\r\nUhland ballad of the same name, adapted for the composer by Richard\r\nPohl. The original text is not closely followed and several other poems\r\nby Uhland are introduced, such as _Die drei Lieder_, _Entsagung_, and\r\n_Hohe Liebe_, the singing of which last-named song is made the occasion\r\nthat leads to the tragedy. The cantata opens with a description of\r\nthe castle and the proud king by the narrator, after which an alto\r\nsolo announces the advent of the minstrels. The youth sings a graceful\r\nProvençal song and a chorus follows. The stern king angrily objects\r\nto the tender themes chosen by the youth and the harper sings in\r\nsterner mood. The queen plaintively requests more songs and the youth\r\nand the harper again sing of spring and pleasure. The youth then\r\nsings passionately of love and the harper and the queen join him in a\r\npowerful trio that precedes the tragedy, after which the chorus carries\r\nthe narration to the end.\r\n\r\n‘Advent Hymn.’--This setting of a devotional hymn by Friedrich Rückert\r\nfor soprano solo, chorus, and orchestra, was made in 1848. It is a\r\nshort work with only seven numbers, but is broad and impressive in\r\nstyle and is finely illustrative of Schumann’s best choral-writing. The\r\nfirst number is a melodious solo (‘In lowly guise thy King appeareth’)\r\nfor soprano with answering passages for female chorus, which leads\r\ninto a strong five-part chorus (‘O King indeed, though no man hail\r\nThee’). This is followed by a soprano solo (‘When Thou the stormy sea\r\nart crossing’), concluding with a quiet chorus for female voices.\r\nThe fourth number is introduced by a short section for male voices\r\n(‘Thou Lord of grace and truth unfailing’), which is taken up at once\r\nby full chorus in delicate pianissimo and interspersed with frequent\r\nfive-pulse measures. The fifth number is given to a quartet (‘Need is\r\nthere for Thyself, returning’), written in free imitative style. The\r\nlast two numbers are elaborate choruses to which a solo quartet is very\r\neffectively joined. The close is massive and stately--a prayer that\r\nChrist will quench all strife and bring peace and unity to the peoples\r\nof the earth.\r\n\r\nFriedrich Rückert’s ‘New Year’s Hymn’ was set to music by Schumann\r\nin 1849 for chorus and orchestra, with incidental solos for soprano,\r\nalto, and bass. The theme is the familiar one of solemn retrospection\r\nover the Old Year and hopeful anticipation for the New. The solo work\r\nis slight, the weightier utterances being confided to the chorus. The\r\nfinal chorus (‘O prince, waking throned for a year as of right’) is\r\nparticularly effective. Beginning in full, pianissimo harmony, it rises\r\nto a jubilant close, in which appears the chorale ‘Now thank we all our\r\nGod,’ at first in the bass contrapuntally treated and then with all the\r\nvoices in unison.\r\n\r\n‘Mignon’s Requiem’ is a cantata of slight and delicate texture, but of\r\nrich and varied musical beauty. Very different from many of the texts\r\nwhich Schumann chose for choral settings, this one was especially\r\nwritten for music. It is taken from Goethe’s ‘Wilhelm Meister,’ from\r\nthe scene in which the obsequies of Mignon occur. The score is full of\r\npoetic and mystical touches from the first quiet chorus (‘Who comes to\r\njoin our silent assembly?’) to the last triumphant chorus (‘Children,\r\nhaste into life to return’). The work was composed in 1849 for solos,\r\nchorus, and orchestra, but the duties of the soloists are light.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                   VI\r\n\r\nThe list of choral works of Ferdinand Hiller (1811-1885) is an\r\nextensive one. The style in which many of them were written is now\r\nobsolete, however, and only one, ‘A Song of Victory,’ has retained its\r\nearlier popularity. Next in importance to this is the dramatic cantata,\r\n‘Nala and Damayanti,’ founded on an ancient Hindoo poem and written in\r\n1871. Other choral works are the two oratorios, ‘The Destruction of\r\nJerusalem’ (1839) and ‘Saul’ (1858), and the cantatas _O weint um sie_\r\n(1839), ‘Israel’s Song of Victory’ (1841), ‘Song of the Spirits over\r\nthe Water’ (1842), ‘Prometheus’ (1843), ‘Rebecca’ (1843), ‘Heloise’\r\n(1844), ‘Loreley’ (1845), and ‘Prince Papagei’ (1872).\r\n\r\n‘A Song of Victory.’--The triumph of the German arms in the\r\nFranco-Prussian war of 1870 was the occasion that prompted the\r\ncomposition of this cantata, and joy and gratitude for victory are\r\nits dominant moods. It was written for soprano solo, chorus, and\r\norchestra, and the Cologne Festival of 1871 was the scene of its first\r\nperformance. The work opens with a powerful chorus (‘The Lord great\r\nwonders for us hath wrought’) beginning with sustained chords, then\r\nchanging to a movement of great animation. The soprano voice takes up\r\nthe second number (‘Praise, O Jerusalem, praise the Lord’) and, as the\r\nopening phrases are repeated, the chorus adds a soft accompaniment.\r\nThis is followed by a vigorous and dramatic chorus (‘The heathen are\r\nfallen in the pit’), describing the terrors of war and, in contrast,\r\nthe strong confidence of true believers in the protection of the\r\nLord. A short soprano solo (‘See, it is written in the book of the\r\nrighteous’), lamenting for the slain, leads into a beautiful three-part\r\nchorus for female voices (‘He in tears that soweth’), to which the\r\nsoprano obbligato is most effectively added. The sixth number (‘Mighty\r\nis our God’) is a sustained chorus with massive chords. The last two\r\nnumbers are for solo and chorus and return to the exultant mood with\r\nwhich the work begins, the last chorus (‘Praise the Lord for His great\r\nwonders’) closing with an outburst of joy and hallelujah.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe first important contribution which Denmark made to the literature\r\nof music in the larger forms came from the pen of Niels Wilhelm Gade\r\n(1817-1890). Although his music shows strong traces of the influence\r\nof Schumann and Mendelssohn, especially the latter, his best works\r\nare virile, individual, and plainly affected by the harmonies and\r\ncadences of the Scandinavian folk-song. Some of his most forceful and\r\ncharacteristic utterances are to be found in choral forms and here\r\nhe followed Schumann’s example in choosing romantic subjects drawn\r\nlargely from imaginative and fanciful legends and folklore. Several of\r\nthe cantatas are chosen for analysis; the remaining ones are ‘Spring\r\nFantasy’ (1850), ‘Kalamus’ (1853), ‘Spring’s Message’ (1853) for chorus\r\nand orchestra, and ‘Psyche’ (1856) for solos, chorus, and orchestra.\r\n\r\n‘The Crusaders’ is the first[69] secular choral work after ‘Paradise\r\nand the Peri’ to compare in importance and in richness of content and\r\ntreatment with Schumann’s fine composition. It easily takes rank among\r\nthe strongest and most beautiful of nineteenth-century cantatas. It was\r\nwritten in 1866 and performed in Copenhagen the same year. In 1876 Gade\r\nconducted this work as well as his ‘Zion’ at the Birmingham Festival,\r\nEngland. The central motive of the poem by Carl Andersen (much of whose\r\nmaterial is drawn from Tasso’s ‘Jerusalem Delivered’) is the temptation\r\nof the brave crusader Rinaldo d’Este by the sorceress Armida and her\r\nsirens and his triumph over the powers of evil. The personages are\r\nthree in number, Rinaldo (tenor), Armida (mezzo-soprano), and Peter\r\nthe Hermit (bass); and the work is divided into three parts--(1) In\r\nthe desert, (2) Armida, and (3) Towards Jerusalem. The first part\r\nopens with a chorus of pilgrims and women from the crusaders’ host,\r\ndepicting the long, weary march and the sufferings in the struggle\r\nto gain the distant goal. The encouraging voice of Peter the Hermit\r\nis heard (‘Soon our God success will send us’) and Rinaldo sings the\r\nstirring Crusaders’ Song (‘Shine, holy sun, shine on my trusty sword’),\r\nto each stanza of which the chorus adds a vigorous, war-like refrain.\r\nThe Hermit leads the crusaders in an evening prayer of impressive\r\nstrength, beauty, and exalted devotion, and thus the first part\r\ncloses. The second part begins with a long orchestral introduction,\r\ndescriptive of the direful influence of Armida’s magic charms. The\r\nspirits of darkness appear and, as they dance, sing a weird pianissimo\r\nchorus (‘Silent, creeping so light’). In a fine dramatic solo Armida\r\noutlines her plans for the ensnarement of Rinaldo. The sirens, in a\r\nthree-part chorus, sing a melody of truly wonderful sensuous beauty\r\n(‘The wave sweeps my breast’) and their enticing voices are frequently\r\nheard in the tumultuous music of the temptation scene that follows.\r\nArmida sings in seductive tones ‘O Rinaldo, come to endless joy and\r\nrest.’ The brave knight’s senses are enthralled and he is on the point\r\nof yielding when he hears a strain of the Crusaders’ Song as from the\r\ndistance. A powerful concerted number is built up from this point.\r\nRinaldo wavers, the sturdy Crusaders’ Song and the voluptuous music of\r\nthe sirens and Armida struggle for the mastery. The former becomes more\r\ninsistent, the magic spell of the sorceress is broken, and Rinaldo,\r\nnow thoroughly roused, joins fervently in the crusaders’ refrain, ‘Of\r\nheaven the faithful soldier am I ever.’ Like Wagner’s ‘Parsifal,’ with\r\nwhich this cantata has many points in common, the first and third parts\r\nof ‘The Crusaders’ build a religious frame for the vividly contrasting\r\ntemptation scene of the middle part. The third part is introduced by a\r\ncalm and devotional morning hymn of the crusaders, their faces fixed\r\ntoward Jerusalem. The penitent Rinaldo again vows allegiance to the\r\ncross (‘With holy thoughts seek holy things’). His solo leads into\r\nthe choral March of Pilgrims (‘Forward! O weary feet’), stirring,\r\nconfident, and exalted. Jerusalem appears in the distance; the Hermit\r\ncalls the hosts to final combat, the Crusaders’ Song again resounds\r\ntriumphantly and the work closes with a brilliant choral climax (‘To\r\nwar! God wills it, up, arouse thee!’).\r\n\r\n‘The Erl-King’s Daughter.’--Gade composed the music for this cantata\r\nin 1852, the text being founded on Danish legends quite different from\r\nthe one made famous by Goethe’s familiar poem. The knight, Sir Oluf,\r\nhas been bewitched by the Erl-King’s daughters as he slept in the\r\ntwilight on a mound in the forest. Notwithstanding the warning of his\r\nmother, he fares forth on the eve of his wedding-day to seek again the\r\nalluring maidens. They invite him with enticing songs to join their\r\nmoonlight revels and offer him a silken robe for his bride and a silver\r\ncuirass for himself. He refuses to dance with the fairest of them,\r\nshe lays her hand upon his brow and predicts his death. He jumps on\r\nhis steed and madly rushes home, where his mother tremblingly awaits\r\nhim. In the morning light she sees him riding desperately through the\r\nfields without plume or shield; he draws rein at the castle door,\r\nbriefly greets his terrified mother, and falls dead from his steed. A\r\nshort epilogue draws a moral that youths who ride through the woods at\r\nnight should turn aside from the Erl-King’s mound, for ‘danger will\r\never him betide who heeds the Erl-maidens’ singing!’ There are three\r\nsolo voices--the Erl-King’s daughter (soprano), Sir Oluf (baritone),\r\nand Oluf’s mother (alto). The music throughout is very melodious,\r\ngraceful, and pleasing. The most interesting numbers are the chorus of\r\nErl-maidens, the enticing song of the Erl-King’s daughter, the morning\r\nhymn (‘The sun now mounts the eastern sky’) which opens the third part,\r\nand the dramatic finale, a concerted number of much vigor and animation.\r\n\r\n‘Christmas Eve’ is a short meditation on the Nativity (poem by\r\nAugust von Platen), set in cantata-form for alto solo, eight-part\r\nchorus, and orchestra in 1851. A strongly devotional style is\r\nmaintained throughout. In the opening number a seraph (alto) bids\r\nthe hosts of angels to carry earthward the glad tidings of Christ’s\r\ncoming. The second number is a double chorus of seraphim (‘Behold,\r\na star appeareth’) and shepherds (‘Angelic hosts surround us’),\r\nthe two uniting in rich and varied combinations. The seraph, in a\r\nsolo of rare beauty (‘O! with pure devotion’), summons the world to\r\nworship the Child, and the chorus softly sings its ‘praise to the\r\nnewly-born.’ The double chorus is handled antiphonally with great\r\nskill and effectiveness. The final number (‘But now a cheerful morning\r\no’er-spreads the weary earth’) is a flowing, hymn-like melody for alto\r\nsolo, repeated in elaborated form for full eight-part chorus, but\r\nsinking quietly to a reposeful close.\r\n\r\n‘Comala,’ the earliest of Gade’s choral works, was first performed at\r\nLeipzig through Mendelssohn’s influence on March 3, 1843. The dramatic\r\npoem to which the music is written follows Ossian and relates the story\r\nof the Scottish princess Comala, daughter of Sarno, king of Innistore,\r\nwhose ardent passion for Fingal, king of Morven, was as ardently\r\nreturned. Disguised as a youth (in the manner of old Italian opera)\r\nshe follows him on an expedition against Caracul, king of Lochlin.\r\nThe royal lovers part before the battle, Fingal promising to return\r\nvictorious in the evening. Filled with sad forebodings, the princess\r\nwith her maidens awaits him on a height from which she can witness the\r\nbattle. A furious storm arises and amid its roaring blasts the spirits\r\nof the warriors’ ancestors sweep by to guide home the souls of the\r\nslain. Comala imagines that the battle is lost and her lover killed.\r\nOvermastered by her grief, she dies, and Fingal, returning with his\r\nvictorious warriors, hears from the weeping maidens the news of the\r\ntragedy. He sorrowfully calls upon the bards to sing her praises, and,\r\nwith the maidens, they chant a farewell hymn to her as her departing\r\nsoul is borne to the mansions of her fathers. Music and poetry alike\r\nare tinged with the darksome northern colors.\r\n\r\nThe solo work is distributed among four personages--Comala (soprano),\r\nher two maidens Dersagrena and Malicoma (mezzo-sopranos), and Fingal\r\n(bass). The graceful and, in the main, obvious character of the music\r\nhas made this cantata a great favorite for more than a half-century.\r\nMany characteristic touches of northern harmony and melody are brought\r\nto view, as in the orchestral introduction and in the songs of Comala\r\nand the ballads sung by her maids to cheer her (‘There, lonely, sits\r\nComala’ and ‘One day there came from Lochlin’). The parting duet\r\nbetween Fingal and Comala is melodious and sincere; but the main charm\r\nof the work springs from the choruses, which are about equally divided\r\nbetween Fingal’s warriors and Comala’s maidens. Of the male choruses\r\nthe one accompanying Fingal’s victorious return (‘Far fled is the foe’)\r\nis particularly stately and forceful. The female chorus is used with\r\nfine effect in the agitated scene of Comala’s fatal forebodings and\r\nsubsequent death. The chorus of spirits (‘Our pathway is the storm’) is\r\nweird and sepulchral, but becomes dramatic as the frightened princess\r\nraises her voice in supplication to spare her lover. The cantata closes\r\nwith a full chorus of bards and maidens (‘In the darkness of clouds’),\r\nwho, in imposing and majestic unison strains, rich in the sombre hues\r\nof the northern splendor, commend the soul of ‘the sweet loving maiden’\r\nto the spirits of the fathers.\r\n\r\n‘Zion’ is a sacred cantata for baritone solo, chorus, and orchestra,\r\nwritten in 1860 when Gade was at the height of his creative powers.\r\nIt consists of an introduction (‘Hear, O my flock Israel’) in which\r\nthe chorus relates how the Lord God heard the groanings and cries of\r\nthe children of Israel and wrought great wonders in their behalf. This\r\nis followed by two choruses--the first describing the departure from\r\nEgypt and closing with a tranquil fugal section (‘Like as a flock He\r\nhath gently led His people’), and the second portraying the captivity\r\nin Babylon. The final number, entitled ‘The Return,’ relates the\r\nprophecy of the New Jerusalem. The baritone solo takes up the theme\r\nin a dignified aria, followed by a female chorus and closing with an\r\nanimated full chorus (‘Never shall thy sun be setting’) in impressive,\r\nsonorous phrases. The whole work is conceived in a broad oratorio style\r\nin which the influence of both Handel and Mendelssohn may be detected.\r\n\r\n‘Spring’s Message,’ for chorus and orchestra, is based on a poem by\r\nGeibel which depicts Spring as the season of hope, particularly of the\r\nChristian’s hope. This mood is maintained throughout and the composer’s\r\ngift of tuneful melody has thrown over voice-parts and accompaniment\r\nalike a charm that well befits this joyous season. This short work was\r\nwritten in 1853.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                   VII\r\n\r\nFélicien David (1810-1876) was a prominent French composer of the\r\nnineteenth century who attained his maximum popularity in the fifties.\r\nThough he wrote numerous operas and compositions in various other\r\nfields, he is one of those composers whom posterity has remembered\r\nalmost entirely by a single work, in this case, ‘The Desert,’ a\r\ncomposition of singular beauty and charm. While a comparatively\r\nyoung man David had sojourned for several years in the East, in\r\nConstantinople, Egypt, and the Holy Land, and his experiences there\r\nmade an indelible impression upon his talents. The form of ‘The Desert’\r\nis rather hard to classify. The composer calls it a ‘symphonic ode.’\r\nIt consists of orchestral numbers, male choruses, and tenor solos,\r\ngrouped into three parts and interspersed with short descriptive\r\nrecitations. The poem by Auguste Colin, which forms the text of the\r\nwork, made an instant appeal to David and the very spontaneous music\r\nfor it was composed in three months. When it was first performed in\r\nthe hall of the Conservatoire, December 8, 1844, it was received with\r\nenormous applause and was repeated to crowded houses for a month. The\r\npopular estimate then placed upon it has been largely confirmed by its\r\nlong-continued popularity. David wrote three other choral works--the\r\noratorio ‘Moses on Sinai’ (1846), a second symphonic ode, ‘Christopher\r\nColumbus’ (1847), and ‘Eden,’ a ‘mystery’ in two parts, performed at\r\nthe Grand Opéra in 1848--but none of these received popular approval.\r\n\r\n‘The Desert.’--The theme of the work on which David’s fame\r\nchiefly rests is the desert with its silent vastness, its gloom, and\r\nits grandeur. The human interest is centred on a caravan in various\r\nsituations, in the description of which the composer, with remarkable\r\nsuccess, invokes genuine local color; his Arabs are no mere disguised\r\nFrenchmen. Throughout the orchestral introduction a sustained C\r\nsymbolizes the dreary monotony of the boundless stretches of sand; a\r\nfantastic hymn of homage to Allah is sung; the march of the caravan is\r\nbrilliantly depicted, first by the orchestra and then by the chorus;\r\nthe caravan battles with a fierce simoon; calm is restored and the\r\nmarch is resumed until evening halts it. The second part, entitled\r\n‘Night,’ opens with a charming tenor solo (‘O night, O lovely night’),\r\nafter which the orchestra plays an ‘Arab Fantasia’ and a ‘Dance of the\r\nDancing Girls.’ The chorus sings of freedom in the desert and the tenor\r\nindulges in an evening meditation, to an accompaniment in Oriental\r\nrhythm. The third part (‘Sunrise’) begins with a chant of the muezzin,\r\nfounded on a real Arabian melody, calling the faithful to prayer, and\r\nthen the caravan departs on its journey, to the choral music heard in\r\nthe first part. The opening hymn to Allah, with some modifications,\r\nbrings the work to a close. The Oriental atmosphere is preserved\r\nthroughout to an astonishing degree.\r\n\r\n\r\n       [Illustration: Cantata Writers of the Nineteenth Century:\r\n               Top: Ferdinand Hiller and Félicien David\r\n            Bottom: Niels W. Gade and W. Sterndale Bennett]\r\n\r\n\r\nIt will be observed that the Germans have been given by far the most\r\nnumerous representation among the choral works thus far mentioned,\r\nthere being among them compositions by only three composers of other\r\nnationalities--Gade, a Dane, and Berlioz and David, both Frenchmen.\r\nThis numerical difference represents a fair statement of the relative\r\nimportance of choral music in continental countries in the period\r\nunder present discussion (that is, from 1800 to about 1870). In France\r\nchoral music was entirely overshadowed in artistic significance by the\r\nopera, as, indeed, were all other forms of music. The list of German\r\ncomposers of cantatas and shorter choral works might be even still\r\nfurther extended by the inclusion of Robert Franz (1815-1892), the\r\nwriter of exquisitely refined songs, who also composed the 117th Psalm\r\nfor double chorus _a cappella_, a Kyrie for four-part chorus and solos\r\n_a cappella_, and a Liturgy for the Evangelical service; and Franz Abt\r\n(1819-1885), chiefly known by ballads of a folk-song character and a\r\nlarge number of cantatas for female voices and male voices, all written\r\nin an easy, flowing, popular style.\r\n\r\nIn England, cantatas, especially those based on some story or legend,\r\nhave long been exceedingly popular. The love of choral music has been a\r\nnational characteristic of the English people for over two centuries.\r\nAs early as the seventeenth century choral festivals were organized\r\nby various cathedral choirs acting conjointly. The celebration of St.\r\nCecilia’s day was made the occasion of some of the earliest of these\r\nfestivals and ‘The Musical Society’ was organized in London in 1683 in\r\norder to conduct them on a more artistic basis. Musical festivals and\r\nassociations were later formed in the provinces and grew into great\r\nfavor. As time went on these assumed large dimensions and exerted\r\nan artistic influence as in no other country. Some of those now in\r\nexistence are extremely old, as the ‘Festivals of the Three Choirs’\r\nof Gloucester, Worcester, and Hereford, organized in 1724, and the\r\nBirmingham Festival, begun in 1768 by a series of concerts made up\r\nalmost exclusively of Handel’s works. The tremendous popularity of\r\nHandel’s choral works in England not only resulted in the extension of\r\nthe Handel worship which continued unabated until the frequent visits\r\nof Mendelssohn attracted much of its enthusiasm to his own superb\r\noratorios, but caused a substantial increase in the number of choral\r\nsocieties throughout the kingdom. These societies have been unusually\r\ngenerous in giving native works abundant hearing and English composers\r\nwere not slow to take advantage of the opportunities thus offered.\r\nEnglish choral works, therefore, constitute a formidable array. From\r\nthe time of Purcell until the present generation of composers, however,\r\nvery few works have been produced that rise much above the general\r\nlevel of mere respectability or amiable reflection of Handelian and\r\nMendelssohnian models that seems to be the chief characteristic of\r\nEnglish choral music of the period thus bounded. Indeed, English choral\r\nworks produced in this period before 1850 are practically a negligible\r\nquantity in the literature of this branch of musical art. But among\r\nEnglish composers who were active in this field in the third quarter of\r\nthe nineteenth century there are several who deserve special mention;\r\nthese are Sir Julius Benedict, Sir Michael Costa, Sir George A.\r\nMacfarren, Sir William Sterndale Bennett, and Henry Smart.\r\n\r\nJulius Benedict (1804-1885), an eminent German who made England his\r\nhome during the last fifty years of his life, contributed frequently\r\nand successfully to the Norwich Festivals, of which he was the\r\nconductor from 1845 to 1878, inclusive. Here in 1860 his beautiful\r\ncantata ‘Undine’ was performed, in which the famous singer Clara\r\nNovello made her last public appearance. In 1863 at the same festival\r\nhis cantata ‘Richard Cœur de Lion’ was produced and in 1866 ‘The\r\nLegend of St. Cecilia.’ The cantata ‘Graziella,’ intended for the\r\nNorwich Festival of 1881 but not completed in time, was produced at\r\nthe Birmingham Festival of 1882. Of these cantatas, ‘The Legend of\r\nSt. Cecilia’ is the most important. The poem, written by the English\r\ncritic and author Henry F. Chorley, presents four characters--Cecilia\r\n(soprano), her husband, Valerianus (tenor), the Prefect of Rome (bass),\r\nand a Christian Woman (contralto)--and choruses of Roman citizens,\r\nChristians, and angels. It sets forth the wedding festivities, the\r\nconversion of Valerianus to Christianity by the angelic vision through\r\nCecilia’s prayers, the discovery of his defection by the angry prefect\r\nof Rome who had just joined them in wedlock, his trial, the parting and\r\nfinally the death of the pair--Valerianus by being beheaded and Cecilia\r\nby the slow martyrdom of the stake.\r\n\r\nMichael Costa (1808-1884), an Italian composer and conductor who lived\r\nin England after 1830, was closely identified with English choral\r\nmusic as conductor of the Birmingham Festivals from 1849 to 1882, as\r\nconductor of the Sacred Harmonic Society and the Handel Festivals\r\nfrom 1857 to 1880, in which latter capacity he wrote additional\r\naccompaniments to most of Handel’s oratorios, and as composer of two\r\nimportant oratorios which will be mentioned in a later chapter, and\r\nof several shorter choral works. His serenata, ‘The Dream,’ which was\r\nwritten to a poem by William Bartholomew for the marriage festivities\r\nof the Princess Royal of England to Prince Frederick William of\r\nPrussia, afterward Emperor Frederick, is a short and delightfully\r\nmelodious composition for four solo voices, chorus, and orchestra.\r\nOberon (bass) commands the fairies to prepare a car for Queen Mab\r\n(alto), who charms the eyes and ears of The Lady (soprano) so that\r\nshe may in her dreams see the form and hear the tones of adoration of\r\n‘her beloved lover’ (tenor). The principal numbers are a dainty and\r\nbright chorus of fairies (‘Make the car of a golden king-cup’), an\r\nimpassioned serenade by the lover (‘O the joy of truly loving’), and a\r\nclosing choral serenade (‘Lady, arise! look forth and see’), tuneful\r\nand sparkling.\r\n\r\nGeorge Alexander Macfarren (1813-1887) was one of the most\r\ndistinguished and scholarly English musicians of the nineteenth\r\ncentury. He was a prolific composer in many fields and in none was he\r\nmore successful than in choral-writing. His operas, oratorios, and\r\ncantatas are numerous, and in the last-named group his important works\r\nare ‘Leonora,’ composed in 1851; ‘May-Day,’ written for the Bradford\r\nFestival, 1856; ‘Christmas,’ written in 1859 and first performed at a\r\nconcert of the Musical Society of London on May 9, 1860; ‘The Lady of\r\nthe Lake,’ founded on Scott’s poem and produced at the Glasgow Musical\r\nFestival, November 15, 1876; ‘Songs in a Cornfield,’ written in 1868\r\nfor female voices to words by Christina Rossetti; and ‘Outward Bound’\r\n(1877). John Oxenford, a popular librettist of the period, furnished\r\nthe texts for ‘Christmas,’ ‘May-Day,’ and ‘Outward Bound.’\r\n\r\n‘May-Day,’ for soprano solo, chorus, and orchestra, is a brief cantata\r\nfull of the jollity of this old-time festival, with its ancient\r\nceremony of choosing the May-Queen and the accompanying rustic revels.\r\nIt contains many examples of the quaint style of part-writing prevalent\r\nin the preceding century, among them the delightful part-song ‘The\r\nHunt’s up.’[70] ‘The Lady of the Lake’ is a work of large dimensions\r\ndemanding five solo voices--Ellen, the Lady of the Lake (soprano),\r\nBlanche of Devan (contralto), James FitzJames, the Knight of Snowdoun\r\n(tenor), Roderick Dhu (baritone), and James, Earl of Douglas (bass).\r\nThe most interesting music in this cantata is assigned to the chorus,\r\nand here the composer demonstrates his fine ability in effective\r\npart-writing, at the same time introducing many touches borrowed from\r\nthe idiom of Scottish folk-melodies.\r\n\r\nHenry Smart (1813-1879) was one of the earliest of the modern English\r\ncomposers to come under the influence of the romantic movement. He\r\nis most widely known for his part-songs, organ music, and anthems\r\nand other Anglican ritual-music, but his best work is the cantata\r\n‘The Bride of Dunkerron.’ He produced several other cantatas of less\r\nmerit--‘King René’s Daughter’ (1871) and ‘The Fishermaidens,’ both for\r\nfemale voices, and the sacred cantata ‘Jacob,’ written for the Glasgow\r\nFestival and performed there November 10th, 1873.\r\n\r\n‘The Bride of Dunkerron’ was written for the Birmingham Festival of\r\n1864. The poem by Frederick Enoch is founded on a legend concerning a\r\nLord of Dunkerron, whose castle was on the coast of Kerry, who fell in\r\nlove with a sea-maiden and followed her to her watery home. She seeks\r\nthe Sea-King’s consent to their union, which he not only refuses to\r\ngive but condemns her to death for loving a mortal and drives her lover\r\nfrom his realm by a tempest which casts his body upon the shores. There\r\nare solo parts for the Sea-Maiden (soprano), Dunkerron (tenor), and\r\nthe Sea-King (bass). The solos are numerous and uniformly grateful,\r\nthe most conspicuous ones being Dunkerron’s simple but charming song\r\nas he waits on the seashore for the maiden’s appearing (‘The full moon\r\nis beaming’), the Sea-King’s aria (‘Oh, the earth is fair in plain\r\nand glade’), and the maiden’s graceful song (‘Our home shall be on\r\nthis bright isle’) which she sings as she departs to win the consent\r\nof the Sea-King. The chorus has important work to do and Smart shows\r\nconspicuous skill in handling this factor. The opening number is in\r\nreality a double chorus of peasants who tell of Dunkerron’s nightly\r\nwatch by the sea, and sea-maidens who sing the enticing songs that\r\nprove to be his undoing. After the long love-duet between Dunkerron\r\nand the maiden, there ensues a brisk and stirring chorus which\r\ndepicts the journey of the lovers through the waters to the maiden’s\r\ndwelling-place. The sea-maidens sing several attractive choruses and a\r\nchorus of storm-spirits (‘Roar, wind of the tempest, roar’) foretells\r\nthe impending tragedy and leads to a dramatic trio for the three\r\ncharacters. The king’s angry edict dooms the lovers and the double\r\nchorus of peasants and sea-maidens closes the work as it began it, but\r\nthe mood is now one of sad lament over the tragic dénouement.\r\n\r\n‘King René’s Daughter’ is a cantata for female voices, written in\r\n1871. The poem by Frederick Enoch is based on a lyric drama by Henrik\r\nHertz. King René, of Provence, had betrothed his infant daughter\r\nIolanthe to the son of the Count of Vaudemont. She became suddenly\r\nblind before she had emerged from babyhood, and, in order to keep from\r\nher the realization of her loss, her father brought her up without\r\nany knowledge of what sight means. A magician offered to restore her\r\nsight, making only the one condition that she first be told of the\r\nlost faculty, but this her father refused to do. One day her betrothed\r\npassed through the valley where she dwelt, singing his troubadour\r\nsongs. He beheld Iolanthe for the first time and was fascinated by\r\nher beauty. Through the song which he sang to her of the lovely rose\r\nshe realized the existence of the lost sense, and, this having been\r\ndisclosed to her and the magician’s condition thus fulfilled, she\r\nwas healed. There are thirteen numbers in the cantata and the solo\r\nparts are Iolanthe (soprano), Martha (mezzo-soprano), and Beatrice\r\n(contralto), though other solo voices are added in a trio and later\r\nin a quartet which, as narrator, tells of the troubadour’s song to\r\nIolanthe. The entire work is written in a melodious, graceful style and\r\ncloses with a chorus of exuberant joy at the restoration of sight to\r\n‘King René’s daughter the fair.’\r\n\r\nSterndale Bennett (1816-1875) has not infrequently been called ‘the\r\nEnglish Mendelssohn,’ not because he was a conscious imitator of his\r\ngreat German contemporary and intimate friend, but because his music\r\nexemplifies the same qualities of polished refinement and exquisite\r\nworkmanship, although of far less inspirational value and emotional\r\ncontent. Bennett was a ‘shy and reticent’ composer in point of the\r\nnumber of his works, and of these (there are only 46 opera in all) only\r\nthree were in extended choral forms, namely, an ‘Ode for the Opening\r\nof the International Exhibition,’ 1862, to words by Tennyson, ‘The\r\nMay Queen,’ a pastoral cantata, and ‘The Woman of Samaria,’ a sacred\r\ncantata usually classed as an oratorio.\r\n\r\n‘The May Queen’ was written for the Leeds Festival of 1858 and,\r\nnotwithstanding the poorly-written libretto by Henry F. Chorley, is\r\nreplete with musical beauties of striking power. The solo parts are\r\nassigned to the May Queen (soprano), the Queen (alto), the Lover\r\n(tenor), and the Captain of the Foresters, as Robin Hood (bass). The\r\nstory relates the celebration of May-Day in ancient times on the banks\r\nof the Thames, which is interrupted by a quarrel between the jealous\r\nand despondent lover of the May Queen and Robin Hood, who enters at the\r\nhead of a band of rollicking foresters and openly makes love to the May\r\nQueen. The Queen enters, the lover is arrested for having struck the\r\nforester, the May Queen intercedes for his release and thereby reveals\r\nher affection for him, the forester is banished for having stooped\r\nto woo a peasant girl, the Queen orders the wedding of the May Queen\r\nand her lover on the following morning, and everything ends happily.\r\nThe music (there are ten numbers in the cantata) is characterized\r\nthroughout by utmost refinement and grace of expression and is\r\ndistinctly individualized in respect to the different personages. The\r\nfinest solos are the lament of the disconsolate lover (‘O meadow, clad\r\nin early green’) and the forester’s robust song (‘Tis jolly to hunt\r\nin the bright moonlight’). The chorus-writing is scholarly, always\r\neffective without over-taxing the singers, bright, spirited, and\r\nspontaneous. This cantata is to be numbered among the most beautiful\r\ncompositions of this class.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                   VIII\r\n\r\nAnglican ritual-music of the nineteenth century falls into two natural\r\ngroups. The first group comprises the compositions up to about 1850\r\nwhich complete the third period of English church-music (see page\r\n93) overlapping from the preceding century; the second group begins\r\nwith the evidences of new life that crept into English church-music\r\nabout the middle of the century and brought to it refreshing vigor and\r\nregeneration. Most of the anthems and ‘services’ of the first half of\r\nthe century repeat the colorless and listless style of the preceding\r\ncentury, yet several composers produced music of real worth, dignity,\r\nand solidity. Such were William Crotch (1775-1847); Thomas Attwood\r\n(1765-1838), a pupil of Mozart and a close friend of Mendelssohn (to\r\nwhom the latter dedicated his three preludes and fugues for organ),\r\nwhose ‘I was glad,’ written for the coronation of George IV with\r\nfull orchestral accompaniment, is a remarkably fine work of imposing\r\nbreadth; and Thomas Attwood Walmisley (1814-1856). Among the most\r\nrepresentative examples of the work of this group of composers will be\r\nfound the following anthems: Attwood’s ‘Withdraw not Thou’ and ‘Grant\r\nwe beseech Thee,’ Walmisley’s ‘Remember, O Lord’ and ‘O give thanks.’\r\nWith the melodious music of Sir John Goss (1800-1880) and the notable\r\nseries of anthems and ‘services’ by Rev. S. S. Wesley (1810-1876) and\r\nSir George A. Macfarren (1813-1887), what might be called the middle\r\nmodern school of English anthem-music comes to an end. On the whole\r\nacademic and respectable rather than inspired, the religious music of\r\nthis period is only the outward expression of the drowsy and apathetic\r\ninner life of the Church.\r\n\r\nThe motets of the nineteenth century and the decades just preceding\r\nhave, in the main, far closer kinship to the sacred cantata than to\r\nthe typical form whose name they assume. Beautiful as the motets of\r\nHaydn, Mozart, and Cherubini are as music, they are far removed from\r\nthe old motet in spirit, even though they were written to be sung\r\nat High Mass. The best motets written for the German Evangelical\r\nservice were attempts to revive the glories of Bach’s motet style.\r\nIn this field Mendelssohn achieved noteworthy success (see page 151)\r\nand the well-known motets of Moritz Hauptmann (1792-1868), cantor of\r\nthe Thomasschule at Leipzig for over twenty years, attest how deeply\r\nhe imbibed the spirit of his great predecessor. The motets of these\r\ntwo composers represent the best examples of this form in the period\r\ncovered by this chapter. But as the years move on, the old motet is\r\nbecoming more and more archaic.\r\n\r\nThe nineteenth-century part-song had a brilliant history. The\r\nenthusiasm with which it was cultivated in Germany under certain\r\npatriotic stimuli, later spread to England and France with happy\r\nresults. The first German choral society made up wholly of amateur\r\nsingers was the Berlin _Singakademie_, founded on May 27th, 1791,\r\nby Karl Christian Fasch (1736-1800). Male choruses, as much social\r\nas musical in nature, had existed in Germany since the seventeenth\r\ncentury, but they did not attain much popularity or influence until\r\nCarl Friedrich Zelter (1758-1832) established the first _Liedertafel_\r\nin Berlin in 1808, composed of twenty-four men from the _Singakademie_.\r\nThe political effect of Weber’s stirring part-songs, especially his\r\nsetting of the patriotic songs in Körner’s _Leyer und Schwert_, as,\r\nfor example, ‘Bright sword of liberty’ and ‘Lützow’s wild hunt,’ has\r\nbeen already mentioned. The love of choral singing became contagious,\r\nand, stimulated by the new feeling of nationalism, both male choruses\r\n(_Liedertafeln_) and choral societies (_Gesangvereine_) began to\r\nmultiply rapidly, especially after 1818. Though much of the part-music\r\nwritten for their consumption was weak and tasteless, many of the\r\ngreat composers bountifully contributed of their best ideas. Schubert\r\nwrote some fifty pieces of this class, twenty-two of which are for\r\nunaccompanied male voices. Among these seldom-sung pieces are many\r\nof astonishing beauty, as his setting of _Nur wer die Sehnsucht\r\nkennt_. Schumann wrote about a dozen part-songs for male voices and\r\nsome twenty for mixed voices, many of them as poetic and charmingly\r\nmelodic as his songs. Mendelssohn’s part-songs, however, exerted an\r\noverpowering influence not only in his own country but especially in\r\nEngland, where he was imitated _ad nauseam_ for nearly fifty years by\r\nnative composers. Here, however, they were instrumental in creating\r\nsuch a revival of choral singing among the people, well-nigh dead\r\nsince the old madrigal days, that singing societies were established\r\nfar and wide throughout the land, even in remote communities. So many\r\nof these part-songs of Mendelssohn are familiar household songs in\r\nGermany, England, and America that it will be unnecessary to name\r\nany here. Among the German part-song writers of less importance are\r\nIgnaz Seyfried (1776-1841), Julius Otto (1804-1877), Friedrich Kücken\r\n(1810-1882), Friedrich Truhn (1811-1886), Ferdinand Hiller (1811-1885),\r\nRobert Franz (1815-1892), Carl Wilhelm (1815-1873), composer of _Die\r\nWacht am Rhein_, Franz Abt (1819-1885), and Joachim Raff (1822-1882).\r\n\r\nThough Mendelssohn’s part-songs set the prevailing style in England for\r\nmany years, many native compositions of sterling worth were produced.\r\nSterndale Bennett wrote only three, but they are fine examples of this\r\nclass, especially ‘Come, live with me.’ John L. Hatton (1809-1886),\r\nHenry Smart (1813-1879), Sir George A. Macfarren (1813-1887), Henry\r\nLeslie (1822-1896), Ciro Pinsuti (1829-1888), and other composers in\r\nEngland have written fine part-songs that have been deservedly popular.\r\nBut Robert L. de Pearsall (1795-1856), who wrote almost exclusively in\r\nthis form, succeeded in a remarkable degree in combining the quaintness\r\nof the old madrigal with the freedom and grace of the more modern\r\nstyle. He published about sixty madrigals and part-songs, a large\r\nproportion of which will remain a permanent part of the literature of\r\nthis field. Among the finest of these may be mentioned the ten-part\r\nsong ‘Sir Patrick Spens,’ probably the most elaborate and successful\r\npart-song in existence, the genuinely humorous ‘Who shall win my lady\r\nfair,’ the melodious ‘When last I strayed,’ ‘Purple glow,’ and ‘O who\r\nwill o’er the downs so free,’ and others equally masterly.\r\n\r\nAbout 1835 a general movement was started in France for the\r\nestablishment of singing societies called _Orphéon_. These were\r\norganized in the communal schools, among working people, and at the\r\nuniversities, but were for male singers only. They became very popular\r\nand spread with great rapidity. The corporation of Paris recognized\r\ntheir importance and made choral singing one of its municipal\r\ndepartments, in 1852 placing Gounod at the head of the _Orphéon_.\r\nAnnual contests and festivals were instituted which attracted choral\r\nsocieties from every part of France. In 1867 these choral societies\r\nnumbered 3,243 with a membership of 147,500. The rapid increase\r\nin interest in choral singing naturally led to the composition of\r\nnumberless unaccompanied part-songs, which were on the whole more\r\nelaborate than the English part-songs and which admitted the dramatic\r\nelement very frequently. Among French composers who wrote expressly for\r\nthese societies were Halévy, Adolphe Adam, Félicien David, Ambroise\r\nThomas, Gounod, Delibes, Massenet, Dubois, Bazin, and particularly\r\nLaurent de Rillé, whose compositions in this form number over a hundred.\r\n\r\n\r\n                              FOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[68] An adaptation of this melody is associated in England and America\r\nwith Charles Wesley’s Christmas hymn, ‘Hark! the herald angels sing.’\r\n\r\n[69] Though most of Berlioz’s ‘Damnation of Faust’ was written in\r\n1845-6, it really antedated Schumann’s work both in inception and in\r\nthe actual composition of many of its finest numbers (see page 158).\r\n\r\n[70] Any morning song of a lively, spirited nature, even a love-song,\r\nwas called a ‘Hunt’s-up’ in olden English times.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                               CHAPTER VI\r\n\r\n                          THE MODERN CANTATA\r\n\r\n     Wagner: ‘The Love Feast of the Apostles’; Liszt: ‘The Bells\r\n     of Strassburg,’ ‘Prometheus’--Brahms: ‘Song of Triumph,’\r\n     ‘Song of Destiny’--Max Bruch; ‘Frithjof,’ ‘Fair Ellen,’ ‘The\r\n     Cross of Fire,’ ‘The Lay of the Bell,’ etc.--Rheinberger;\r\n     Dvořák; Hofmann; Goetz--Grieg; Gounod; Sullivan: ‘The Golden\r\n     Legend’; Barnby; Gaul; Stainer; Cowen--Parry; Mackenzie;\r\n     Stanford--Elgar: ‘King Olaf’; ‘Caractacus’; ‘The Black\r\n     Knight’--Coleridge-Taylor: ‘Hiawatha’ cycle--Dudley Buck:\r\n     ‘The Golden Legend’; ‘The Light of Asia’; Horatio Parker and\r\n     other cantata writers in the United States.\r\n\r\n\r\nTeutonic genius was supreme in the field of cantata-writing until the\r\nlast quarter of the nineteenth century, when there appeared numerous\r\nand worthy rivals. While the Germans have consistently retained their\r\nlove for this form and have maintained a numerical lead in actual\r\nproduction, England, France, Scandinavia, and America have produced\r\nchoral works that challenge comparison with the best German standards,\r\nand in some instances have struck out original lines of development\r\nthat mark points of notable departure from the older models. The\r\nperiod covered by this chapter includes the works produced in the last\r\nquarter, or at most the last third, of the nineteenth century, with\r\nsome flexibility at either boundary.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                   I\r\n\r\nThe most notable exception to the above chronological grouping is\r\nRichard Wagner (1813-1883), who belongs to the preceding chapter as far\r\nas dates are concerned. But so many of the prominent composers here\r\nconsidered were so strongly influenced, consciously or unconsciously,\r\nby the Bayreuth master’s art-methods and followed them in such a direct\r\nline of succession, that this seems the more fitting place to mention\r\nhis brief connection with this field of musical literature.\r\n\r\n‘The Love Feast of the Apostles’ (_Das Liebesmahl der Apostel_) was\r\nWagner’s one and only cantata. It was written in 1843, the same year\r\nas Schumann’s ‘Paradise and Peri’ and three years before Berlioz\r\ncompleted his ‘Damnation of Faust.’ Wagner had already written ‘The\r\nFlying Dutchman’ and ‘Rienzi’ had been performed in Dresden the summer\r\npreceding the composition of this cantata. The thirty-year-old composer\r\nput into this work much of the dramatic power already hinted at in\r\n‘The Flying Dutchman’ and displayed with such overwhelming power in\r\nhis later works. It was written for a great _Männersängerfest_ held in\r\nDresden in July, 1843, and was first performed under his own direction\r\non the 6th of the month in the _Frauenkirche_, the orchestra and chorus\r\nnumbering one thousand performers. The subject of this Scriptural Scene\r\nwas suggested by the fourth chapter of the Acts of the Apostles and\r\nWagner wrote his own words, as he did in all of his dramatic works.\r\n\r\nThe opening chorus represents the disciples, drawn together by\r\npersecution, offering consolation to one another. After a few quiet\r\nmeasures of greeting the voices divide into three choruses, when the\r\nmovement accelerates and leads to a powerful climax, ending pianissimo.\r\nThe apostles (twelve bass voices) then enter with a hearty greeting,\r\nwhile the disciples sing softly _Wir sind versammelt im Namen Jesu\r\nChristi_ (‘We are assembled in the name of Jesus Christ’), after which\r\nthe united chorus swells forth in a majestic passage, invoking the\r\nblessing of the Holy Spirit, beginning with the words _Allmächt’ger\r\nVater, der du hast gemacht Himmel und Erd’ und Alles was darin_\r\n(‘Almighty Father, Thou that did’st create Heaven and the Earth and all\r\nthat in them is’). Voices from above (as in the last act of ‘Parsifal’)\r\nare then heard singing _Seid getrost, ich bin euch nah_ (‘Peace be\r\nyours, I am at hand’). To this the disciples respond with renewed\r\nvigor, while the apostles counsel unswerving consecration to God. The\r\nwork closes with a mighty chorale, _Denn ihm ist alle Herrlichkeit von\r\nEwigkeit zu Ewigkeit_ (‘To Him all praise and glory be forever and\r\nforever’), its dramatic effect being greatly heightened by the rich\r\norchestral accompaniment. The orchestra has remained silent until the\r\nfinal number.\r\n\r\nFranz Liszt (1811-1886) was an artist of amazing versatility and\r\ntremendous creative energy. Greatest as a virtuoso and a composer of\r\ninstrumental music of striking originality and picturesque romanticism,\r\nhe yet wrote liberally in various choral forms. In addition to notable\r\nchurch works, large and small, and three oratorios, Liszt wrote\r\nseveral cantatas and shorter choral works--‘The Bells of Strassburg,’\r\n‘St. Cecilia’ (for mezzo-soprano, chorus, and orchestra), _An die\r\nKünstler_ (for solos, male chorus, and orchestra), _Zur Säcular-Feier\r\nBeethoven’s_ (for solos, chorus, and orchestra), _Festalbum_ for\r\nGoethe’s centenary (1849), ‘Prometheus,’ Psalm 13 (for tenor solo,\r\nchorus, and orchestra), Psalm 18 (for male chorus, orchestra, and\r\norgan), Psalm 23 (for tenor or soprano solo with harp and organ), Psalm\r\n137 (for solo and female chorus with violin, harp, piano, and organ),\r\nand a large number of male choruses.\r\n\r\n‘The Bells of Strassburg.’--Liszt composed this work (_Die Glocken\r\ndes Strassburger Münsters_) in 1874 and dedicated it to Longfellow.\r\nThe text is a mere fragment from this poet’s ‘Christus’--the prologue\r\nto ‘The Golden Legend’--and deals with the futile effort of the prince\r\nof darkness and his legions, during a furious night tern nest, to cast\r\ndown the cross surmounting the cathedral tower. The work is written\r\nfor baritone solo (Lucifer), mixed chorus, and orchestra. It opens\r\nwith a short prelude entitled ‘Excelsior,’ consisting of this word\r\nsung several times by the chorus with ever-increasing power, ending\r\nfortissimo. The main movement, called ‘The Bells,’ begins with a\r\nponderous introduction by the bells, trumpets, and horns, after which\r\nLucifer hurls forth his first command, exhorting his band of spirits\r\nto tear down the cross. The chorus of spirits (sopranos, altos, and\r\ntenors) replies to this (‘Oh, we cannot, for around it’) and then the\r\ntenors and basses, representing the bells, sing a Latin chant. These\r\nvoices continue in the same order, Lucifer’s exhortation and the cry\r\nof helplessness from the evil spirits becoming more and more vehement\r\nas the chant of the bells ever replies in tones of calm trust in the\r\nprotecting power. Lucifer’s fourth and last appeal is given with the\r\nfull strength of voice and orchestra. In the reply of the chorus the\r\nfemale voices unite, producing a fine effect with the first and second\r\ntenors. At length Satan, defeated, gives the order to retreat, and the\r\nwork closes with the Gregorian chant,\r\n\r\n      _Nocte surgentes\r\n      Vigilemus omnes!\r\n      Laudemus Deum verum_,\r\n\r\ngiven by the combined chorus, organ, and orchestra.\r\n\r\n_Prometheus._--This cantata, founded on Herder’s poem of the same\r\nname, was composed by Liszt in 1850. He utilizes several of Herder’s\r\nprologues, which describe the situations in words and serve to\r\nintroduce the various choral numbers. The first prologue depicts\r\nPrometheus, the Titan, bound to a stake and about to suffer torture for\r\nhaving stolen fire from heaven. This leads to a chorus of sea-nymphs\r\n(female voices), expressing sorrow and fear. The second prologue\r\ndescribes the anger of Oceanus at the children of earth for disturbing\r\nhis waters and gives Prometheus’ reply. This is followed by a spirited\r\nmixed chorus of Tritons and a lovely melodious chorus of Oceanides\r\nfor female voices, closing with a full double chorus, ‘Holy and grand\r\nand free is the gift of Heaven.’ The third prologue introduces the\r\ngoddess Gæa with her train of wood-nymphs, loudly weeping. The chorus\r\nof Dryads follows, in the midst of which occurs a very dramatic alto\r\nsolo, ‘Deserted stand the Gods’ sacred altars in the old forest.’ In\r\nthe dialogue following Gæa upbraids Prometheus, who stoutly defends\r\nhimself. The number closes with a mixed chorus of gleaners, which is\r\nfull of graceful melody. In the next prologue Bacchus builds an arbor\r\nto soften the Titan’s suffering and a male chorus of vine-dressers\r\nfollows. At length an _Allegro moderato_ for orchestra introduces\r\nHercules, who with an arrow kills the vulture which is about to devour\r\nPrometheus and frees him, bidding him ‘Go hence unto thy mother’s\r\nthrone.’ This leads to a stately male chorus, ‘All human foresight\r\nwanders in deepest night.’ The last prologue pictures the pardon of\r\nPrometheus at the throne of Themis, and the work closes with a chorus\r\nof the Muses.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                   II\r\n\r\nThe genius of Johannes Brahms (1833-1897) touched many fields and\r\nhe was great in every field that he entered--orchestral, pianoforte,\r\nchamber, song and choral. Several of his choral works, notably the\r\n_Deutsches Requiem_, the _Schicksalslied_ and the _Triumphlied_, are\r\namong the great things of choral literature and enjoy undisputed\r\npopularity. Even those that are modest in dimensions are equally\r\nserious with the larger ones in conception and in treatment and spring\r\nfrom the deep places of the composer’s soul. In all of them, as in\r\nhis symphonies, he reached a point of sublimity that had seldom been\r\ntouched, if at all, since Beethoven. All of his published compositions\r\nbetween his opus 40 and opus 60, with two exceptions, were vocal works,\r\nsongs or choral. The ‘Requiem’ was opus 45 and his period of greatest\r\nactivity as a writer of choral works followed soon after. Of these\r\nonly ‘Rinaldo,’ the first one written after the ‘Requiem,’ can really\r\nbe called a cantata; the others partake more of the character of the\r\node or the choral ballad. They are _Rhapsodie_, founded on fragments\r\nfrom Goethe’s _Harzreise_ for alto solo, male chorus and orchestra;\r\n_Schicksalslied_ (‘Song of Destiny’) for chorus and orchestra;\r\n_Triumphlied_ (‘Song of Triumph’) for eight-part chorus and orchestra;\r\n_Naenie_ for chorus and orchestra and _Gesang der Parzen_ (‘Song of\r\nthe Fates’) for six-part chorus and orchestra, the last two of which\r\nwere later compositions in the form of short choral ballads like\r\nthe _Schicksalslied_. He wrote liberally in forms approximating the\r\npart-song. In many of the early _Marienlieder_, male choruses and mixed\r\nchoruses, he adopts the form of the simple harmonized melody, while\r\nin others, as the two motets, opus 29, he is the direct descendant\r\nof Bach, the contrapuntist. In some of his little known _a cappella_\r\nchoruses, as the lovely _Vineta_ from his opus 42 and two from his\r\nopus 104, he produces strange and wonderful effects through a masterly\r\nhandling of harmonic changes and melodic interweavings.\r\n\r\n‘Song of Triumph.’--Brahms wrote his _Triumphlied_ in 1871 to\r\ncommemorate the German victories and the consequent establishment\r\nof the German empire, and he dedicated it to Wilhelm I. Its first\r\nperformance was at Vienna in 1872; a repetition occurred at Cologne\r\nin 1873 at the fifty-first Festival of the Lower Rhine. The text was\r\nadapted by the composer from the nineteenth chapter of Revelation. The\r\nwork, consisting of three movements, was written for double chorus,\r\norchestra and organ, together with two short baritone solos. A lively\r\nyet solemn prelude introduces the first number, at the close of which\r\nboth choirs enter with the words ‘Hallelujah! Praise the Lord!’\r\nThe principal theme of this movement is founded on an old German\r\nsong, _Heil dir im Siegerkranz_. This part closes with a tremendous\r\ncontrapuntal climax of Handelian proportions. The second part, like\r\nthe first, has its prelude, followed by a short fugue, after which a\r\nnew melody is introduced and sung antiphonally by the two choirs. The\r\nstrongest climax occurs in the third movement. After a brief orchestral\r\nintroduction a baritone solo is heard, ‘And behold then the heavens\r\nopened wide,’ to which the choruses reply, ‘And yonder a snow-white\r\nhorse.’ Then the baritone sings, ‘And lo! a great name hath He\r\nwritten,’ following which the choruses utter the stately phrase, ‘King\r\nof Kings and Lord of Lords,’ sung antiphonally with ever-increasing\r\nfervor and ending with the full power of voices, organ and orchestra,\r\nthe stately effect of which is beyond description.\r\n\r\nThe _Schicksalslied_ (‘Song of Destiny’) for chorus and orchestra,\r\nwith text by Hölderlin, is a noble and expressive work, which received\r\nits first performance Oct. 18, 1871, at a concert given by the\r\nCarlsruhe Philharmonic Society, the composer conducting. The two ideas\r\nof death and eternal life are placed in juxtaposition and although\r\nthese dominant ideas are dramatically balanced against each other,\r\nthe close dispels the clouds and lets in a flood of light. Indeed the\r\ncomposer seems to open heaven itself to his hearers and to usher them\r\nin. While the poet morbidly depicts the existence of immortals on the\r\none hand and suffering humanity on the other, Brahms, by introducing an\r\norchestral prelude of great beauty, injects a new idea, namely, that\r\nthere is hope for man and that he is not to be ruthlessly chained to\r\nuncertainty or lured by the Unknown. After dramatically setting forth\r\nthe two conflicting ideas, in the development of which Brahms closely\r\nfollows the poet in the music, he returns once more to the beautiful\r\nmusic of the introduction, which brings the hearers safely back again\r\ninto an atmosphere of peace and hope and solace. It is a striking\r\nexample of the power of instrumental music to change the effect\r\nproduced by the poetic text.\r\n\r\n_Rinaldo._--This cantata is written for tenor solo and male chorus\r\nto a text by Goethe and its value lies in the beauty of the choruses\r\nand in the intimate solos, expressive of the love which has filled\r\nthe heart of the hero Rinaldo for the enchantress Armida. The poetic\r\ntext, however, is rather vague and leaves too much to the imagination\r\nof the hearer. Armida, the heroine, does not appear at all nor does\r\nthe ‘diamond shield,’ to which is assigned such an important function\r\nin rousing the enamored Rinaldo from his shame, and the music is not\r\nsufficiently definite to supply the hearer with the missing links.\r\nEspecially effective is the closing chorus, which depicts Rinaldo,\r\nfreed from the wiles of the enchantress and safe with the crusaders on\r\ntheir homeward journey.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                   III\r\n\r\nThe mastery of Max Bruch (b. 1838) over concert choral forms has won\r\nhim a foremost place among German choral writers of the nineteenth\r\ncentury and his works are known and valued wherever choral music is\r\ncultivated. He combines fluent, pleasing melody with rare skill in\r\nhandling and grouping his orchestral and vocal forces. His choral\r\nwriting is always broad, dignified, impressive and vocally grateful.\r\nThe list of his choral works is quite imposing. His larger works\r\ncomprise the two oratorios _Moses_, opus 67, and _Gustav Adolf_, opus\r\n73, both late compositions, and three epic cantatas, a form to which he\r\ngave especial attention. These three, which are frequently classed as\r\nsecular oratorios, are _Odysseus_, opus 41, _Arminius_, opus 43, and\r\n_Achilleus_, opus 50. In addition he has produced a number of shorter\r\ncompositions in cantata and choral ballad form. They are, in the order\r\nof their composition, ‘Frithjof Scenes’ for solos, male chorus and\r\norchestra; ‘Fair Ellen’ for solos, chorus and orchestra; ‘Salamis, a\r\nTriumph-song of the Greeks,’ poem by H. Lingg, for solos, male chorus\r\nand orchestra; ‘Frithjof at His Father’s Grave’ for baritone solo,\r\nfemale chorus and orchestra; _Normannenzug_ for baritone, male chorus\r\nand orchestra; _Römische Leichenfeier_, text by Lingg, for chorus and\r\norchestra; ‘The Lay of the Bell’ (_Das Lied der Glocke_) for solos,\r\nchorus and orchestra; ‘The Cross of Fire’ (_Das Feuerkreuz_) for solos,\r\nchorus and orchestra; and ‘Leonidas’ for male chorus and orchestra. He\r\nhas also written several very attractive short sacred choruses, among\r\nthem the _Jubilate, Amen_, opus 3, for soprano, chorus and orchestra,\r\nand ‘The Flight of the Holy Family’ for chorus and orchestra.\r\n\r\n_Frithjof_, for baritone and mezzo-soprano solo voices, male chorus and\r\norchestra, is one of his finest productions and was his first work to\r\nachieve a signal success. It was written at Mannheim in 1863, when he\r\nwas only twenty-five years old, and the extraordinary favor with which\r\nit was received caused this masterwork of the youthful composer to\r\nbecome the prototype of a numerous group of dramatic cantatas for male\r\nvoices that followed in its wake. The text comprises six scenes taken\r\nfrom Bishop Tegner’s far-famed _Frithjofsaga_.\r\n\r\nA lively orchestral introduction, entitled ‘Frithjof’s Return,’ leads\r\nto a beautiful baritone aria, ‘How bravely o’er the floods so bright,’\r\naccompanied by an attractive chorus, ‘O ‘tis delight when the land afar\r\nappeareth.’ The second scene depicts Princess Ingeborg, whom Frithjof\r\nhas come home to wed, being led to the altar by King Ring, the result\r\nof a plot by Ingeborg’s brothers against Frithjof. A brief wedding\r\nmarch is followed by the bridal chorus, ‘Sadly the skald walks before\r\nthe train,’ and Ingeborg’s lament, ‘My heart with sorrow overflowing.’\r\nThe next scene, ‘Frithjof’s Revenge,’ intensely dramatic both in the\r\nvocal score and the rich instrumentation, opens with a chorus of\r\npriests, ‘Midnight sun on the mountain burns,’ in the midst of which\r\nis heard Frithjof’s cry, ‘Go to Hela’s dark abode,’ and after it his\r\nrugged aria, ‘Where my father rests.’ As he sings this, he fires the\r\ntemple and flees to his ship, amid the dramatic and descriptive cries\r\nof the people and Frithjof’s followers, and the curses of the priests.\r\nThis chorus is a work of great tonal beauty, portraying vividly the\r\ndramatic action of the text. The fourth number, entitled ‘Frithjof’s\r\nDeparture from the Northland,’ opens with a male quartet of exceptional\r\ncharm, followed by Frithjof’s powerful solo, ‘World’s grandest region,\r\nthou mighty North!’ In the fifth scene occurs ‘Ingeborg’s Lament,’ a\r\nsorrowful and pathetic heart-cry to her lost lover, ‘Storms wildly\r\nroar,’ after which comes the finale, a spirited chorus sung by Frithjof\r\nand his men as they sail away in the good ship ‘Ellida’ in quest of\r\nfurther adventures.\r\n\r\nThe story of Bruch’s ‘Fair Ellen’ is laid at Lucknow, British India,\r\nand the story is founded on an incident said to have occurred during\r\nthe famous siege of this city in 1857, when a Scotch girl, fair Ellen,\r\nheard, above the din of battle, the shrill bagpipes of the Macgregors\r\nin the far distance, as the relief party approached, playing ‘The\r\nCampbells are Coming.’ Her inspired words of hope and encouragement\r\nstirred the despairing defenders to renewed resistance, beating off\r\nthe besiegers until rescue was at hand. The cantata, the text of which\r\nis Emanuel Geibel’s ballad of the same name, was written in 1869. It\r\nis of modest dimensions, embracing solos for soprano and baritone,\r\nand five chorus numbers. The music, following Bruch’s style, is rich\r\nin instrumentation, while the choruses are full of fine melody. The\r\nScotch tune, ‘The Campbells are Coming,’ is introduced many times\r\nin the orchestral score, and at the close the composer makes a fine\r\nclimax by broadening out the joyous march-melody into a devout hymn of\r\nthanksgiving.\r\n\r\n‘The Cross of Fire,’ a dramatic cantata founded on incidents in Sir\r\nWalter Scott’s ‘Lady of the Lake,’ was composed in 1888 and is one of\r\nthe finest of Bruch’s later choral works. It was an ancient custom\r\nin the Highlands of Scotland, when one clan declared war on another,\r\nto call the clansmen to arms by means of a ‘cross of fire.’ After\r\nsolemn consecration at the altar, this war-signal was carried with all\r\npossible speed from post to post by noble messengers and in its wake\r\nthe men-at-arms assembled. Bruch’s librettist, Heinrich Bulthaupt,\r\nopens the cantata at the point in Scott’s familiar poem where Norman,\r\na noble Highlander, is proudly leading his bride Mary, a noble maiden,\r\nto a near-by mountain chapel to celebrate the wedding ceremony. The\r\nwedding train approaches the church to the festal sounds of organ and a\r\nwedding anthem. As the ceremony is about to begin, Angus, a messenger,\r\nrushes in with the cross of fire and hurriedly hands it to Norman with\r\nthe chieftain’s command to bear it to the nearest post. Norman bids\r\na heart-broken farewell to his bride and hurries off followed by his\r\nwarriors. Poet and composer now describe the feelings of Norman on his\r\nrapid journey, battling between duty and love. The rising of the clan\r\nin response to the war-signal is given vivid portrayal. Then follows\r\nthe best-known number of the cantata, the beautiful _Ave Maria_, in\r\nwhich the despairing Mary expresses her emotions at being left alone.\r\nThe stirring war-song, ‘Clan Alpin! Clan Alpin!’ in which Norman rouses\r\nhis warriors to a high pitch of bravery, is an impressive number, and\r\nBruch with fine effect uses an old Scotch battle-song. The final number\r\nis a masterly concerted piece. Mary and her maidens anxiously watch\r\nthe ebb and flow of battle from a neighboring hill-top. The cry goes\r\nup that Norman has fallen, but shouts of victory are soon heard, the\r\nvaliant Norman appears and rapturously throws himself in Mary’s arms,\r\nand joy and happiness reign. This number is massive, full of life,\r\nvigor, and effective contrast, and furnishes a brilliant climax to the\r\nwhole work.\r\n\r\nSchiller’s ‘Lay of the Bell’ has furnished inspiration to numerous\r\ncomposers. Romberg’s cantata has already been described and this\r\ncalled forth several rivals. Bruch’s is the most pretentious of them\r\nand approaches closely to the oratorio form. The poem loses in musical\r\nsetting through its over-abundance of rapidly-passing scenes--there\r\nare twenty-seven numbers grouped into two parts--but the music abounds\r\nin moments of great beauty, especially in such choral numbers as the\r\nfinal one in the first part, ‘One blest assurance yet is granted,’\r\nthe funeral chorus in the second part (‘From the steeple, sad and\r\nslow’), the chorus, ‘Hallowed Order, child of Heaven,’ which is one\r\nof the most elaborate of the work, and the finale with preceding bass\r\nsolo, ‘Heave it, brothers, heave it high!’ Near the close a charming\r\ntrio for soprano, alto and tenor voices appears (‘Peace benignant,\r\ngentle Concord’) into the accompaniment of which Bruch has skilfully\r\nand effectively interwoven the melody of the familiar Christmas song,\r\n‘Silent night, hallowed night!’\r\n\r\nFor each of his great epic cantatas Bruch chose a warrior\r\nhero--Frithjof the Viking, Arminius the German liberator, Odysseus\r\nand Achilles, the Greek chieftains. _Odysseus_ was first performed\r\nin Bremen in 1873. It was written to the poem of Wilhelm Paul Graff,\r\nwhich, like the ‘Frithjof,’ consists of a series of scenes or episodes.\r\nThese are grouped into two parts, the first containing four scenes and\r\nthe second six, drawn from the adventurous and picturesque life of the\r\nKing of Ithaca. Arminius, equally epic in feeling and treatment, was\r\nwritten in 1875 to a poem by F. Cueppers. The scene is laid in Germany,\r\nthe time being from 9 to 13 A. D. when Arminius (Latin for Hermann)\r\nlaid the foundations of the political league of the Germanic tribes\r\nby uniting them for the time being against the common Roman foe and\r\nthrowing off the Roman yoke. The work is in four parts--‘Introduction,’\r\n‘In the Sacred Forest,’ ‘The Insurrection,’ and ‘The Battle’--and\r\ncloses with an inspiring patriotic hymn of stately proportions,\r\n‘Germany’s sons shall be renowned.’ The part of Arminius (baritone)\r\nis particularly fine throughout. Both of these cantatas are equally\r\npopular and they were followed in 1885 by another on the same general\r\nlines, _Achilleus_, to the poem by H. Bulthaupt, the motives of which\r\nare drawn from Homer’s _Iliad_. This is in many respects a greater work\r\nthan its predecessors; it is laid out on broader lines, the orchestral\r\npart seeks greater recognition and the composer frequently and with\r\ntremendous effect employs the double chorus in building up massive\r\npolyphonic climaxes.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                   IV\r\n\r\nJoseph Rheinberger (1839-1901) is a prolific composer who has\r\ncontributed most liberally to choral literature. In this field and\r\nthat of organ he is at his best. _Christophorus_, sometimes called an\r\noratorio, was written in 1880 and is based on the mediæval legend of\r\nthe giant who, notwithstanding his mighty strength, sought a master\r\nto serve who was most powerful on earth and who knew no fear. But he\r\nfound that the mightiest earthly monarch feared Satan and that Satan\r\nshrank in terror before the Cross, so he gladly became the servant of\r\nthe Lord of the Cross. The composer mingles sacred and secular elements\r\nin a masterly manner; portions of the work, particularly the closing\r\nnumbers of the first part, belong to the richest and most beautiful\r\nchoral writing of the last half of the nineteenth century. ‘The Star\r\nof Bethlehem,’ a Christmas cantata, possesses sustained beauty and is\r\nconceived in a lofty vein. _Das Thal des Espingo_, a choral ballad for\r\nmale voices and orchestra (poem by Paul Heyse), is one of the finest\r\nexamples of its kind. ‘Clarice of Eberstein,’ ‘Toggenburg,’ ‘Montfort,’\r\n_Die Rosen von Hildesheim_ for male chorus and wind instruments, and\r\n_Wittekind_ are among the finest of his secular compositions.\r\n\r\nAntonin Dvořák (1841-1904) is the one representative Bohemian\r\ncomposer who has given serious attention to the larger choral forms.\r\nHis greatest compositions in this field, however, were written,\r\nnot for performance in his native land, but for the great English\r\nfestivals--the _Stabat Mater_, composed in 1876 and performed March\r\n10th, 1883, by the London Musical Society, the ‘Spectre’s Bride,’\r\nwritten for the Birmingham Festival of 1885, ‘St. Ludmila’ (oratorio)\r\nfor the Leeds Festival of 1886, and the Requiem Mass for the Birmingham\r\nFestival of 1891. England did valiant service in calling the world’s\r\nattention to Dvořák’s unique genius.\r\n\r\n‘The Spectre’s Bride.’--This well-known cantata is founded upon an old\r\nlegend, current among all Slavic nations, about a maiden, who, deserted\r\nby her lover and awaiting his return, was enticed away at midnight by\r\na spectre, only to be led over hill and dale, amid grewsome horrors,\r\nto the graveyard. There she took refuge in a tiny house where she was\r\nbeset by spectres, and the moonlight revealed, lying on a plank, a\r\nrevivified corpse, which rose up and glared at her. Her fervent prayers\r\nto the Virgin finally ended the hideous spell. A cock crew, dawn came,\r\nand the girl wended her way home in the peaceful morning. When the work\r\nwas performed at Birmingham it was received with great enthusiasm and,\r\ndespite its horrible story, it is a masterpiece of dramatic narrative\r\nand descriptive realism.\r\n\r\nThe cantata consists of eighteen numbers. Eleven of these are allotted\r\nto the narrator (baritone), who, with the choral responses and\r\nsupported by vividly descriptive instrumentation, gives a realistic\r\nportrayal of the frightful scenes. The weirdness of the music increases\r\nin intensity up to the entrance of the maiden in the house of the\r\ndead. In the seven remaining numbers other solo voices are heard. The\r\nlament of the maiden (soprano) for her lost lover and, at the close,\r\nher fervent appeal to the Virgin are fascinating in their beauty.\r\nThere are also four duets sung by the bride and the spectre (tenor),\r\ntogether with one in which the chorus participates. As Hadow says in\r\nhis ‘Studies in Modern Music’ (Vol. II, p. 206): ‘There is too much\r\nmonotony of suffering; there is too much gloom and terror and pain;\r\na tragedy so unrelieved comes near to overstraining the sympathy\r\nof the spectator.’ Yet the musical appeal, through the composer’s\r\ninexhaustible resources of rhythmic, harmonic and melodic effects,\r\ngarbed in gorgeous orchestral colors, softens the horrors and lightens\r\nthe prevailing darkness of the poem.\r\n\r\nHeinrich Karl Johann Hofmann (1842-1902) had the good fortune to win\r\npublic recognition in different fields in rapid succession. In three\r\nsuccessive years his ‘Hungarian Suite’ for orchestra (1873), his\r\n‘Frithjof’ symphony (1874), and his cantata ‘Melusina’ (1875) achieved\r\nsuch instant favor that he soon became one of the best-known of the\r\ncontemporary German composers. While these successes were somewhat\r\nephemeral and while he manifested a tendency to sacrifice individuality\r\nof expression to sensuous charm and formal beauty, the ‘Melusina’\r\ndeserves long life. He followed the lead of Schumann in choosing\r\nlegends and fairy tales as subjects for his most successful cantatas.\r\nThese are, in addition to the one just mentioned, _Aschenbrödel_\r\n(‘Cinderella’), _Nornengesang_ (‘Song of the Norns’) for female chorus,\r\nand _Waldfräulein_.\r\n\r\nThe ‘Legend of the Fair Melusina’ was composed in 1875. Melusina, a\r\nfountain nymph, becomes betrothed to Count Raymond and marries him\r\nunder the agreement that she may go her own way one day in every seven,\r\nwithout question or hindrance on his part. In these intervals she again\r\nbecomes a mermaid and bathes with her nymphs in her native fountain.\r\nLater, urged by his mother Clotilda and his uncle Sintram, who are\r\nconsumed with jealousy and curiosity, Raymond invades her privacy.\r\nDoomed by this violation of his compact to eternal separation, he\r\nembraces Melusina for the last time and dies in her arms. The weeping\r\nnymph returns to her former element. The music is not difficult and\r\nis replete with melody of captivating charm. The melodious prologue,\r\nthe rollicking hunting song, the rapturous love-duet, the chorus of\r\nnymphs at the fountain with Melusina, the dramatic choral accusation of\r\nthe people against Melusina, the final duet with choral accompaniment\r\nleading to the tragic dénouement--all these have contributed to make\r\nthis one of the most musically effective of the more unpretentious\r\ncantatas.\r\n\r\nHermann Goetz (1840-1876) was cut off too early in his career to have\r\ngiven full expression to his undeniably great talent, yet he has left\r\nat least one choral work that demonstrated love for, and ability in,\r\nthis form. In his setting of Schiller’s _Nänia_ (_Auch das Schöne muss\r\nsterben_) for chorus and orchestra, as well as the 137th Psalm (‘By the\r\nWaters of Babylon’) for soprano, chorus and orchestra, he reveals a\r\nclose kinship to both Schumann and Brahms in his effective handling of\r\nvoices and instruments.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                   V\r\n\r\nEdvard Hagerup Grieg (1843-1907), the greatest of the Scandinavian\r\ncomposers, chose musical forms of modest mold and outline--such as\r\nhis altogether charming songs and piano pieces--for many of his most\r\nfragrant and characteristic thoughts. He wrote only three choral\r\npieces--all in the smaller forms, but all individual, brilliant and\r\nfull of his peculiarly charming idiom. They are _Vor der Klosterpforte_\r\n(‘At the Convent Door’) for solo, female voices and orchestra, the\r\nwell-known and vigorous _Landerkennung_ (‘Land Discovery’) for male\r\nchorus and orchestra and the Scenes from Björnson’s unfinished drama,\r\n_Olaf Trygvasson_, for solos, chorus and orchestra. The last is the\r\nlargest and most elaborate of the three and has for its subject-matter\r\nthe efforts of Olaf, a descendant of Harold Haarfagar (the first king\r\nof Norway) but brought up in banishment, to conquer Norway and convert\r\nits people from Paganism to Christianity.\r\n\r\nFor fully thirty years after the middle of the nineteenth century had\r\nbeen passed, French composers were still too firmly wedded to the\r\noperatic stage to give more than fleeting attention to choral forms of\r\nthe cantata type, and few French names of this period, therefore, will\r\nfind place here.\r\n\r\nCharles Gounod (1818-1893), who turned his thoughts almost exclusively\r\nto religious music in the later years of his life, wrote several\r\noratorios which will be mentioned in detail in Chapter VIII. His\r\nsmaller works--the 137th Psalm (‘By Babylon’s Wave’), the 129th\r\nPsalm (‘Out of Darkness’), and especially the motet, ‘Gallia,’ with\r\nsoprano solo--evidence a fund of pleasing melody that, while not\r\necclesiastical in feeling, lies close enough to the apprehension of the\r\naverage listener to make his music deeply prized by lovers of sweet\r\nmelody. The ‘Gallia’ (to words from the Lamentations of Jeremiah) is\r\na lamentation over the disaster that befell his country in the war of\r\n1870; it was written for soprano, chorus and orchestra and was first\r\nproduced at the Albert Hall, London, May 1, 1871, at the opening of\r\nthe International Exhibition. Théodore Dubois (born 1837), who was\r\none of the many winners of the coveted _Prix de Rome_, on his return\r\nfrom Italy produced an important choral work, ‘The Seven Last Words of\r\nChrist’ (_Les sept Paroles du Christ_), on Good Friday, 1867, at St.\r\nClotilde’s, of which he was then choir-master. The writer of melodious\r\nopera-music, Jules Massenet (1842-1912), has written one charming\r\ncantata, _Narcisse_ (‘Narcissus’), for chorus and orchestra, that was\r\nproduced in 1877. After 1880, however, choral works in the smaller\r\nforms became more numerous in France.\r\n\r\nAt the beginning of the last quarter of the nineteenth century elements\r\nof distinctive individuality began to creep into English cantata-music\r\nand assert themselves more and more. Out of the mass of cantatas that\r\ncame into being to feed the choral appetites of the vast number of\r\nEnglish singing societies and festivals, works of impressive beauty\r\nand fine workmanship appeared that would reflect credit on the choral\r\nliterature of any nation. English composers have seized upon the\r\nballad, the legend and the fairy-tale, upon scenes from secular and\r\nsacred history, and have exercised especial industry in using them as\r\nmaterial for choral works. Their number is so great that but a few can\r\nbe named.\r\n\r\nArthur Seymour Sullivan (1842-1900) is best known in the field of\r\ncantata by the ‘Golden Legend,’ though it was preceded by two others,\r\n‘Kenilworth,’ written in 1864 for the Birmingham Festival, and ‘The\r\nMartyr of Antioch,’ in 1875, for the Leeds Festival.\r\n\r\n‘The Golden Legend’ received its first presentation at the Leeds\r\nMusical Festival in 1886. The text consists of those portions of\r\nLongfellow’s poem which concern Elsie and Prince Henry. Joseph Bennett,\r\nwho acted as librettist, has arranged these into six scenes with a\r\nprologue and epilogue. The prologue describes the attempts of Lucifer\r\nand his spirits to tear down the cross from the spire of Strassburg\r\nCathedral, Lucifer being a baritone, his spirits sopranos and altos,\r\nand the bells tenors and basses. In the opening scene of the legend\r\nPrince Henry in his chamber sings ‘I cannot sleep.’ This is followed by\r\nthe temptation duet with Lucifer, which ends with an angels’ chorus. In\r\nScene II Ursula, Elsie’s mother, sits before her cottage and sings an\r\nevening song and the villagers are heard in a beautiful choral hymn, ‘O\r\ngladsome light.’ In the following dialogue Elsie discloses her decision\r\nto offer her life for the prince and then sings the beautiful prayer,\r\n‘My Redeemer and my Lord.’\r\n\r\nScene III is on the road to Salerno; Henry and Elsie sing a graceful\r\nduet, ‘Sweet is the air with budding haws’; pilgrims pass, intoning a\r\nLatin hymn, and Lucifer, among them, utters his mocking lines, ‘Here\r\nam I, too, in the pious band’; the prince’s song of greeting to the\r\nsea is heard, and also a sweet song by Elsie, ‘The night is calm and\r\ncloudless,’ effectively repeated with full chorus. Scene IV is at the\r\nMedical School at Salerno. Lucifer, disguised as Friar Angelo, leads\r\nElsie away to her sacrifice, but she is rescued by the repentant\r\nprince. The music to this dramatic scene is most stirring. In Scene V,\r\nbefore Ursula’s cottage, a messenger recites the prince’s miraculous\r\ncure and Elsie’s safety; after which Ursula’s prayer of thanksgiving\r\nis heard, ‘Virgin, who lovest the poor and lowly.’ The last scene is\r\nat the Castle of Vautsberg on the Rhine, on the evening of the wedding\r\nday. After a joyous duet by Prince Henry and his bride (now the Lady\r\nAlicia), there follows a choral epilogue, rising at the end to a great\r\nfugal climax.\r\n\r\nJoseph Barnby’s (1838-1896) part-songs and church-music and his long\r\nexperience as conductor of important choral societies gave him a large\r\ninfluence with an important section of English lovers of choral music.\r\nHis choral pieces include the melodious psalm, ‘The Lord is King,’\r\nwritten for the Leeds Festival of 1883, and the cantata ‘Rebekah,’\r\nwhich he characterizes as a ‘sacred idyll.’\r\n\r\n‘Rebekah’ was written in 1870 and is undoubtedly his finest work. It\r\ndeals with the wooing of Rebekah by Isaac as related in the Scriptures\r\nand done into verse by Arthur Matthison. The first and last choruses\r\ndisclose some effective modern fugue-writing that is melodious and\r\nexpressive as well as contrapuntally interesting. The last chorus,\r\nespecially, builds up to a massive and vocally brilliant climax.\r\nProbably the best-known number is Isaac’s solo, the favorite tenor\r\naria, ‘The soft southern breeze plays around me.’\r\n\r\nAlfred Robert Gaul (1837-1913) is the composer of many pleasing and\r\npopular cantatas, mostly on sacred subjects, the most widely known of\r\nwhich are ‘The Holy City,’ ‘Ruth,’ ‘The Ten Virgins’ and ‘Joan of Arc.’\r\n\r\nSir John Stainer (1840-1901) writes in a more serious style, but yet\r\nmore suited to church choirs than to large choral bodies. ‘The Daughter\r\nof Jairus,’ ‘The Crucifixion’ (A Meditation for Passion Week), and ‘St.\r\nMary Magdalen’ are his more familiar cantatas.\r\n\r\nFrederic Hymen Cowen (born 1852) has been a prolific writer of\r\ncantatas, no fewer than seven having come from his pen. They are ‘The\r\nRose Maiden’ (1870), ‘The Corsair’ (1876), ‘St. Ursula’ (1881), ‘The\r\nSleeping Beauty’ (1885), ‘St. John’s Eve’ (1889), ‘The Water Lily’\r\n(1893), and ‘The Transfiguration’ (1895). Some of these, particularly\r\n‘The Rose Maiden,’ have attained wide popularity because of their easy,\r\nfluent melody and pleasing part-writing.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                   VI\r\n\r\nIt remained for three Englishmen, all born within five years of each\r\nother--Mackenzie (1847), Parry (1848) and Stanford (1852)--to break\r\naway from the traditions of English choral music and to venture to say\r\ntheir musical thoughts in their own way. The point of departure from\r\nthe old to the new paths bases itself squarely on the work of this\r\ntrio. Cowen and Cordor (both born in 1852) added nothing of importance\r\nto the musical means of expression employed by this trio, but Elgar\r\n(born in 1857) has carried forward English choral music to heights\r\nnever before attained. The decade between 1847 and 1857, therefore,\r\nis memorable in English musical history in having witnessed the birth\r\nof the men who are most responsible for the remarkable revolution in\r\nthe character of English choral music witnessed in the last quarter of\r\nthe nineteenth century. It is a curious coincidence that the ode, a\r\nform cultivated with such industrious zeal by early English composers,\r\nshould have appealed with great force to all of the trio mentioned\r\nabove, as a musical form worthy of revival. No less than fourteen odes\r\ncame from their pens.\r\n\r\nWhen the first important choral work of Charles Hubert H. Parry (b.\r\n1848), scenes from Shelley’s ‘Prometheus Unbound,’ was produced at\r\nthe Gloucester Festival of 1880, its new tone of confident assertion\r\nwas recognized as the beginning of a new era in English music, though\r\nits success with the public was very small. Works of impressive\r\nsignificance followed in quick succession and he became a figure of\r\ndominant importance in English musical life. In addition to three\r\noratorios and several works combining symphonic and choral forms, he\r\nhas written an imposing list of shorter choral works. The ordinary form\r\nof the cantata has little appeal for him, and none of his choral works\r\nis so named. ‘The Pied Piper of Hamelin,’ however, is really a cantata\r\nin feeling, even though it requires very slight solo work. He reaches\r\nsuperb heights of sustained expression in some of his odes--he wrote\r\nten in all--that stamp his choral writing with qualities of superlative\r\nexcellence, among which are perfect accentuation, mastery of expressive\r\ncounterpoint and remarkable handling of large tonal masses so as to\r\nproduce the greatest effects of sonority and breadth. These qualities\r\nappear with conspicuous force in his famous ‘Blest Pair of Sirens,’\r\nan ode by John Milton, set for eight-part chorus and orchestra, and\r\nfirst sung in 1887 by the Bach Choir. Other choral works before 1900\r\nthat added greatly to his reputation are ‘The Glories of Our Blood and\r\nState,’ a funeral ode by James Shirley, produced at the Gloucester\r\nFestival of 1883, ‘Ode on St. Cecilia’s Day’ (poem by Pope) at Leeds,\r\n1889, _L’Allegro ed il Penseroso_ (poem by Milton) at Norwich, 1890,\r\n‘Invocation to Music’ (ode in memory of Purcell by Robert Bridges) at\r\nLeeds, 1895, and ‘The Lotus-Eaters,’ a choral song, 1892.\r\n\r\nWith the exception of ‘The Witch’s Daughter,’ performed at the\r\nLeeds Festival of 1904, all of the cantatas and shorter choral works\r\nof Alexander Campbell Mackenzie (born 1847) fall within the period\r\ncovered by the present chapter. Attention was first attracted to his\r\nfine command of choral technique by ‘The Bride,’ a cantata founded on\r\na poem by the German poet, Hamerling, and performed at the Gloucester\r\nFestival of 1881. Possibly his highest point of artistic effectiveness\r\nis reached in his fine _Veni, Creator Spiritus_, set to Dryden’s\r\nparaphrase and produced at the Birmingham Festival, 1891. Burns’ ‘The\r\nCotter’s Saturday Night’ furnished inspiration for one of his most\r\ncharacteristic works (for chorus only) and naturally appealed strongly\r\nto his national feeling and idiom. His other cantatas include ‘Jason’\r\n(Bristol Festival, 1882), ‘The Story of Sayid’ (Leeds, 1886), founded\r\non Edwin Arnold’s ‘Pearls of the Faith,’ and the ‘Dream of Jubal’\r\n(Liverpool Philharmonic, 1889). In the last-named cantata he employs a\r\nreciter in addition to soloists and chorus.\r\n\r\nThe cumulative effect of the artistic activity of the notable trio\r\nnamed above may find partial explanation in the fact that together\r\nthey represent the three dominant national branches of the United\r\nKingdom--Parry the Englishman, Mackenzie the Scotchman and Stanford\r\nthe Irishman. The works of these three brilliant exponents of British\r\nmusic reveal many idioms traceable to their respective racial\r\ncharacteristics. In the two choral ballads of Charles Villiers Stanford\r\n(born 1852)--‘The Voyage of Maeldune’ (Leeds Festival, 1889), poem by\r\nTennyson, and ‘Phaudrig Crohoore’ (Norwich Festival, 1896), poem by J.\r\nS. Le Fanu--traits of Irish folk-song appear on many a page and lend to\r\nthe music individuality and a fragrant beauty. Indeed, he has achieved\r\nsome of his greatest successes in his choral ballads. His splendid\r\nsetting of Tennyson’s ‘The Revenge’ (Leeds Festival, 1896), with its\r\nsnappy, breezy and, withal, brilliant style, tempted him to set another\r\nnautical ballad, Campbell’s ‘The Battle of the Baltic,’ which, however,\r\nis hardly as effective. His style is more eclectic than that of his two\r\ngreat contemporaries, combining some of the best German and English\r\nqualities with his own individual mode of utterance. His oratorios will\r\nbe mentioned in another place. He has made very notable contributions\r\nto sacred and church music, especially liturgical music.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                   VII\r\n\r\nSir Edward Elgar’s[71] position as not only the leader among English\r\ncomposers of the present, but as one of the greatest of contemporary\r\ncreative musicians, is amply buttressed by a series of works in\r\norchestral and choral fields, which, though not conspicuous by its\r\nlength, is remarkable for the strength and originality of their\r\nmusical ideas, the vigor of treatment and the supreme command which\r\nthe composer displays over the technical means of expression. Most of\r\nhis greatest works are discussed in other sections of this series, yet\r\nit was in the field of cantata that his name first rose to prominence\r\nand the English festivals furnished the occasion, as in the case\r\nof so many other English composers. ‘The Black Knight’ had found a\r\nrespectful hearing at the Worcester Festival of 1893 and the ‘Scenes\r\nfrom the Bavarian Highlands’ at the same Festival in 1896, but the\r\nproduction of the ‘Scenes from the Saga of King Olaf’ at the North\r\nStaffordshire Festival at Hanley in 1896 created a profound impression\r\nand its remarkable success raised his name at once to a place among the\r\ngreat ones of music. ‘The Banner of St. George’ followed in 1897 and\r\n‘Caractacus,’ the finest of his cantatas, in 1898.\r\n\r\n‘The Black Knight,’ for chorus and orchestra, is a setting of\r\nLongfellow’s translation of Uhland’s poem, _Der schwarze Ritter_, and\r\nthe music with virile urgency sets forth the dramatic incidents of\r\nthis ballad of the mysterious ‘sable knight,’ whose visit at the court\r\nfestivities of an ancient king caused the sudden death of the king’s\r\ntwo children. Elgar’s maturer style is clearly foreshadowed in this\r\nearly work.\r\n\r\n‘The Banner of St. George,’ a ballad for chorus and orchestra, with\r\ntext by Shapcott Wensley, was inspired by the occasion of the Diamond\r\nJubilee of Queen Victoria in 1897 and was performed the same year.\r\nThe poem is divided into two scenes, dealing with the deliverance of\r\na princess from the dragon by the valiant Saint George of Sabra, and\r\nan epilogue in which Elgar makes characteristic use of a stirring\r\n‘marching’ melody, to words of patriotic sentiment, in building up a\r\nrousing choral climax.\r\n\r\n‘Scenes from the Saga of King Olaf’ is a setting of Longfellow’s words\r\nwith additions and connecting passages by H. A. Acworth. The vigorous\r\nand individual style of the preceding works here finds full fruition\r\nand Elgar stands forth as a matured creator, full armed and conscious\r\nof his strength. The poetical selections are grouped into eight scenes\r\nwith introduction and epilogue. These include the remarkably strong and\r\ndramatic ‘Challenge of Thor,’ as the Norse god hurls defiance at the\r\nChristian religion; King Olaf’s return to Norway and his acceptance of\r\nthe challenge; the breaking of the image of Thor and the conversion\r\nof Olaf’s subjects; ‘The Wraith of Odin,’ a stirring choral ballad\r\nrelating the mysterious visit of the spirit of Odin to the banquet\r\nhall; the wooing of Sigrid, queen of Svithiod, by King Olaf, which is\r\npreceded by a charming chorus of the minstrel maids of the queen; the\r\nchoral ballad of Thyri, sister of Svend, the Danish king, who flees\r\nfrom her betrothed to King Olaf’s court for protection--one of the\r\nfinest parts of the cantata--followed by the lovely duet of Thyri and\r\nOlaf; and the death of Olaf in the fierce sea-battle with the Danes,\r\nthrillingly related by the chorus. In the epilogue the efficacy of\r\nChristian love in converting the world is contrasted with that of the\r\nsword and gives occasion to Elgar for constructing a choral climax,\r\nbeginning _a cappella_ with the words, ‘As torrents in summer, half\r\ndried in their channels,’ that for simple beauty and sustained power of\r\nexpression has few equals in choral literature. Three solo voices are\r\nadded to the choral forces at the end.\r\n\r\n‘Caractacus,’ written to the poem by H. A. Acworth for the Leeds\r\nMusical Festival of 1898, stands in the natural progressive order\r\nof his secular cantatas as the strongest of the series and, in many\r\nrespects, the most remarkable of its class in any country or period.\r\nElgar, in this and later choral works, appears in the double rôle\r\nof symphonist and choral writer, for the orchestra frequently rises\r\ninto momentary preëminence and overshadows the choral machinery as a\r\nmedium of expression. ‘Caractacus’ must be thought of in its orchestral\r\ncoloring in order to grasp its full strength and beauty, for Elgar is a\r\nmaster of all modern orchestral resources.\r\n\r\nThis cantata was written at the composer’s home at Malvern in the\r\nimmediate environment of the stirring scenes related in its score and\r\nenacted in ancient times by the heroic defenders of British freedom,\r\nfor it was at Malvern Hills on the Welsh frontier that Caractacus\r\nmade his final stand against the legions of Rome. The work is in six\r\nscenes, the first depicting Caractacus and his warriors in his British\r\ncamp at Malvern Hills at night. It opens after a short orchestral\r\nintroduction with the stirring chorus, ‘Watchmen, alert!’ The king’s\r\ndaughter Eigen and her betrothed Orbin break in upon the sad reveries\r\nof the disheartened monarch and their recital of the warning of the\r\nDruid maiden ushers in the beautiful trio sung by Eigen, Orbin and\r\nCaractacus, ‘At eve to the greenwood we wandered away.’ As they\r\ndepart, the Spirits of the Hills sing a calm benediction, ‘Rest,\r\nweary monarch,’ one of the loveliest choral portions of the work,\r\nscored with consummate skill for both chorus and orchestra. The second\r\nscene shifts the action to the sacred oak grove and deals with the\r\nrites of the Druids as they cast the omens. There is a mystic dance\r\nof the Druid-maidens, ‘Tread the measure left and right,’ which is\r\nan inspiration of enthralling beauty and rhythmic grace but which\r\nnever loses a certain solemn dignity. As the dance ceases, there\r\nfollows the impassioned invocation to Taranis. The king enters, the\r\nArch-Druid deceives him as to the omens, Orbin protests, but is cursed\r\nand driven forth by the Druids. The close of the scene is built up\r\naround the vigorous soldiers’ chorus, ‘Leap to the light, my brand\r\nof fight,’ and the contrasting chorus of Druids as they call down\r\ncurses on Orbin. The third scene pictures the parting of the lovers as\r\nOrbin joins the force of Caractacus. It opens with a graceful rustic\r\nchorus of youths and maidens who are with Eigen, twining wreaths of\r\nflowers, ‘Come beneath our woodland bow’rs.’ The scene closes with\r\nthe beautiful duet of the parting lovers. The fourth scene is again\r\non Malvern Hills and Eigen and her maidens anxiously discuss the\r\nrumors of distant battle. The return of Caractacus and the remnants\r\nof his defeated army brings this part to a close with the impressive\r\nlament of Caractacus (in 7-pulse measure) accompanied by the chorus of\r\nwarriors. Soon afterwards Caractacus and his family are betrayed to\r\nthe enemy and scene five, which is short, relates the embarking of the\r\nBritish captives in Roman galleys. The final scene is the triumphal\r\nprocession in Rome, beginning with a pompous orchestral march followed\r\nby full chorus and dramatic solos by the captives--Caractacus, Eigen\r\nand Orbin. Their bold independence and intrepid defense before the\r\ntribunal of the emperor, Claudius, win pardon and an honored home in\r\nRome. The subject is one that might well appeal to a British composer,\r\nand Elgar, with magnificent effect, seizes the opportunity to add a\r\nstirring epilogue--‘The clang of arms is over’--which unfolds, as it\r\ndevelops, some pages of patriotic sentiment (‘Britons, alert!’) that\r\nare thrilling in their majestic power.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                   VIII\r\n\r\nMusical history has often been called upon to record the fact that a\r\ngifted composer’s firstling has been his best. In the case of Samuel\r\nColeridge-Taylor (1875-1912) his creative imagination never again\r\nreached such fine heights of inspired effort as those attained in its\r\nfirst flight. His greatest work is undoubtedly the cantata, ‘Hiawatha’s\r\nWedding Feast’--the first of the ‘Hiawatha’ trilogy--performed\r\nNovember 11, 1898, at the Royal College of Music, London, while the\r\ncomposer was still a student at this institution. The second part of\r\nthe trilogy, ‘The Death of Minnehaha,’ was brought out in 1899 at the\r\nNorth Staffordshire Festival, and the third, ‘Hiawatha’s Departure,’\r\nmade its first public appearance at a concert of the Royal Choral\r\nSociety, at Albert Hall, March 22, 1900. Two months later the overture\r\nto the entire work received its initial performance. The text for\r\nthe whole trilogy is selected from Longfellow’s familiar ‘The Song\r\nof Hiawatha.’ This poem, which handles with childlike simplicity and\r\ndirectness the emotions and experiences of a primitive race, seems to\r\nhave struck deep into the soul of this Anglo-African composer and he\r\nhas imbued the score, especially of the first part, with an atmosphere\r\nof individuality possessed by none of its successors. He touched a new\r\nvein here which he was not able to inject with equal success into his\r\nother works. The score abounds in concise, characteristic and striking\r\nthemes, many of which are treated in the manner of ‘leading-motives.’\r\n\r\n‘Scenes from the Song of Hiawatha.’--The first part of the trilogy\r\nis ‘Hiawatha’s Wedding-Feast,’ for tenor solo, chorus and orchestra.\r\n‘Sumptuous was the feast Nakomis made at Hiawatha’s wedding’ and the\r\ndetailed description includes not only the banquet itself but the\r\nentertainment which followed, how Pau-Puk-Keewis danced,\r\n\r\n      ‘How the gentle Chibiabos,\r\n      He the sweetest of musicians,\r\n      Sang his songs of love and longing;\r\n      How Iagoo, the great boaster,\r\n      Told his tales of strange adventure.’\r\n\r\nChibiabos’ song, the beautiful tenor solo, ‘Onaway, awake, beloved!’ is\r\none of the gems of the whole trilogy.\r\n\r\nThe second part--‘The Death of Minnehaha,’ for soprano and baritone\r\nsolos, chorus and orchestra--begins with the description of the ‘long\r\nand dreary winter! the cold and cruel winter!’ and continues with the\r\npathetic story of the wasting famine and the fever, how Minnehaha\r\nshuddered at the words of the two uninvited guests, ‘lay down on her\r\nbed in silence,’ how Hiawatha plunged into the forest in search of\r\nfood only to return ‘empty-handed, heavy-hearted.’ Then follows the\r\ndeath and burial of Minnehaha and the lament of Hiawatha. The pathos of\r\nthe words is given striking setting in the music, particularly in the\r\nopening chorus, ‘O the long and dreary winter!’ and in Hiawatha’s noble\r\nlament, ‘Farewell, O Minnehaha!’ which the chorus gently echoes after\r\nhim. The chief share of the work is allotted to the chorus.\r\n\r\nThe third part--‘Hiawatha’s Departure,’ for soprano, tenor and\r\nbaritone solos, chorus and orchestra--is the longest of the three\r\nand has more opportunity for varied effects. Reminiscences of themes\r\nfrom the preceding parts give pleasing thematic unity to the whole\r\nwork. It begins with the return of spring and with it Iagoo, the great\r\ntraveller, ‘full of new and strange adventures.’ He relates to an\r\nincredulous audience how he saw a water ‘bigger than the Big-Sea-Water’\r\nand on it a tall canoe with great wings, ‘bigger than a grove of\r\npine-trees,’ in which were warriors ‘painted white.’ Hiawatha, of\r\nall the listeners, laughed not, for he had seen the same things in a\r\nvision. He tells them of the coming of the white men and prophesies\r\ntheir achievements and the downfall of the Indian race. Then follows,\r\nin simple narrative, Hiawatha’s welcome to the white men and the\r\nmissionary priest who came with them to tell the message of the\r\nSaviour; Hiawatha’s touching farewell to Nakomis and his people (‘I am\r\ngoing, O my people, on a long and distant journey. To the portals of\r\nthe Sunset, to the regions of the home-wind’); and his departure in the\r\nbirch canoe as he ‘sailed into the fiery sunset, To the Islands of the\r\nBlessed, to the land of the Hereafter!’ Musically the third part is\r\nunequal to the others in the strength of its appeal, yet at the close,\r\nHiawatha’s tender words of parting and the answering farewell of the\r\npeople are written in the virile and characteristic mood of the first\r\npart. The solo voices assume a larger share of work than in the other\r\nparts.\r\n\r\nColeridge-Taylor’s other choral works were of course in demand after\r\nthe success of his first one, but, though received with favor, they do\r\nnot measure up to the first, nor did they make the deep impression of\r\nthe ‘Hiawatha’ music.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                   IX\r\n\r\nThe United States did not enter the list of cantata and oratorio\r\nproducing nations until the last quarter of the nineteenth century.\r\nBefore that time W. B. Bradbury, J. A. Butterfield, A. Hamerik, George\r\nF. Root and others had prepared the way for their successors by choral\r\nworks of a simple, popular character suited to the musical conditions\r\nof their time. On account of the number, musical quality, size and\r\nextensive influence of his choral works, Dudley Buck may justly be\r\naccorded the honor of being the first important choral writer in\r\nAmerica.\r\n\r\nThe influence of Dudley Buck (1839-1909) in the field of church-music\r\nwas probably stronger and more fundamental and lasting than in that\r\nof concert choral music, for the needs of American church-music could\r\nnot be met, as could those of choral societies, by mere importation of\r\nforeign-made music. Yet his concert choral works are quite numerous.\r\nThey include the 46th Psalm, written for the Boston Handel and Haydn\r\nSociety, 1872; ‘Don Munio,’ a dramatic cantata written in 1874, whose\r\nstory is taken from Washington Irving’s Spanish papers and deals with\r\nthe wars and loves of the Moorish period; four cantatas for male\r\nvoices--‘King Olaf’s Christmas,’ ‘The Nun of Nidaros’ (1878), ‘The\r\nVoyage of Columbus’ (1885) and ‘Paul Revere’s Ride’; ‘The Centennial\r\nMeditation of Columbia,’ written for the Centennial Exposition and\r\nperformed at Philadelphia, May 10, 1876; ‘The Golden Legend,’ to\r\nwhich was awarded the prize offered by the Cincinnati May Festival\r\nAssociation for the best work by an American and which received its\r\ninitial performance at the Festival in 1880; and his largest and most\r\npretentious choral work, ‘The Light of Asia.’\r\n\r\n‘The Golden Legend’ is, like Sullivan’s cantata of the same name, a\r\nsetting of a portion of Longfellow’s ‘Christus.’ The text is divided\r\ninto a prologue, twelve scenes and an epilogue. The story is identical\r\nwith that of Sullivan’s cantata already mentioned and the music on\r\nthe whole rises to a higher plane of excellence. Especially effective\r\nand deservedly well-known is Elsie’s prayer in the fifth scene (‘My\r\nRedeemer and my Lord’), an aria breathing a deep religious feeling\r\nand filled with calm beauty. Buck is at his best in such numbers as\r\nthe simple hymn for unaccompanied quartet (‘O gladsome light of the\r\nFather’), Elsie’s charming aria in the ninth scene (‘The night is calm\r\nand cloudless’ with a choral refrain of _Kyrie eleison_), and the\r\nlove-duet between Elsie and Prince Henry in the twelfth scene.\r\n\r\n‘The Light of Asia’ was written in 1886, published in London and\r\nperformed there for the first time in St. James’s Hall, March 19,\r\n1889. The well-known poem by Sir Edwin Arnold naturally lends itself\r\nto elaborate treatment and the composer has done it full justice,\r\nconstructing on its strong lines a work that approaches the dimensions\r\nand character of an oratorio. The initial fugal chorus (‘Below the\r\nhighest sphere four regents sit’), foretelling the birth of the child\r\nBuddha who ‘shall deliver men from ignorance,’ establishes at once the\r\nbroad massive outlines of the work. After the King has conferred with\r\nhis ministers as to a remedy for the seriousness of Prince Siddârtha\r\nand, on their advice, has summoned a court of pleasure at which the\r\nmost beautiful maidens are to teach him love, there follows a lovely\r\nduet describing the meeting and recognition of the Prince and the fair\r\nYasôdhara, and the part closes with a jubilant wedding chorus, ‘Enter,\r\nthrice happy!’ The second part--‘The Renunciation’--describes the\r\nsensuous life of the Orient, the awakening of Siddârtha from this life\r\nof love and joy to his mission, his six long years of wandering, his\r\nvictorious struggles with the varied temptations of ‘the fiends who\r\nwar with Wisdom and the Light.’ The third part--‘The Return’--relates\r\nthe sorrows of the lonely Yasôdhara and the return of the wandering\r\nSiddârtha as a Buddha, dressed in the yellow garb of a hermit, begging\r\nalms, yet greeted by his people with glad acclaim. The epilogue and\r\nfinal chorus (‘Before beginning and without an end’) is the choral\r\nclimax of the whole work, constructed with fine musicianship and\r\nmajestic in its effect. Important solo duties are assigned to the\r\nPrince, his wife Yasôdhara and his father, the King.\r\n\r\nDr. Leopold Damrosch (1832-1885), who occupied a position of great\r\ninfluence in the musical life of New York City, wrote two important\r\nchoral works that were published in this country--‘Ruth and Naomi’\r\n(1870), a Scriptural idyl, and ‘Sulamith’ (The Song of Songs), which\r\nwas performed for the first time by the Oratorio Society, New York,\r\nin April, 1882. Other short choral works written by Americans in\r\nthe period now under consideration were ‘Prayer and Praise,’ the\r\nForty-sixth Psalm (Cincinnati Festival prize, 1882), and ‘The Rose,’\r\nby William Wallace Gilchrist (born 1846); ‘The Culprit Fay’ (1879) and\r\n‘Praise of Harmony’ (1886) by Frederick Grant Gleason (1848-1903);\r\n‘Phœbus Arise’ (1882), ‘The Nativity’ (1883) and ‘The Realm of Fancy’\r\n(1884) by John Knowles Paine (1839-1906); ‘The Tale of the Viking’\r\n(1879) and ‘Henry of Navarre’ (1885) by George Elbridge Whiting (born\r\n1842).\r\n\r\nThe choral works from the pen of Arthur Foote (b. 1853) are not\r\nnumerous, but they are fine in musical quality and workmanship.\r\nThere are only three of them and all are settings of poems by\r\nLongfellow--‘The Farewell of Hiawatha’ (1879), a ballad for baritone\r\nsolo, male chorus and orchestra, ‘The Wreck of the Hesperus’ for mixed\r\nvoices and ‘The Skeleton in Armor.’\r\n\r\nGeorge Whitfield Chadwick (b. 1854) has written more voluminously in\r\nthe smaller choral forms, all of his writing being distinguished by\r\na keen feeling for vocal values and a rich harmonic sense. His chief\r\nworks in cantata form are ‘The Viking’s Last Voyage’ for baritone\r\nsolo, male chorus and orchestra, 1880 (Boston Apollo Club, 1881);\r\n‘Lovely Rosabelle’ for solos, mixed chorus and orchestra, 1889\r\n(Boston Orchestral Club, 1890); _Phœnix Expirans_, 1891 (Springfield\r\nFestival, 1892); ‘Columbian Ode,’ 1892, written for the dedication\r\nof the buildings of the World’s Fair, Chicago, May, 1893; ‘The Lily\r\nNymph,’ 1895 (Springfield Festival, 1896); and _Ecce jam noctis_, 1897,\r\nwritten for the commencement exercises of Yale University, 1897, on the\r\noccasion of his receiving from Yale the honorary degree of Master of\r\nArts.\r\n\r\nHoratio William Parker (b. 1863) has been a prolific writer of choral\r\nworks, both before 1900 and since that date, and, through his skilful\r\nhandling of vocal masses and a superb contrapuntal technique, has won\r\nfor himself a foremost place among living masters of choral writing.\r\nWhile a student under Rheinberger at Munich, two of his choral works,\r\n‘The Ballad of a Knight and his Daughter’ (1884) and ‘King Trojan’\r\n(1885), were given public performance there and were later published.\r\n‘The Ballad of the Normans’ (_Normannenzug_) for male chorus and\r\norchestra appeared in 1889; ‘The Kobolds’ (poem by Arlo Bates) for\r\nchorus and orchestra was performed at the Springfield (Mass.) Festival\r\nin May, 1891; ‘Harold Harfagar’ for chorus and orchestra was performed\r\nin 1891 in New York; ‘The Dream-King and his Love’ (poem by Geibel)\r\nfor tenor solo, chorus and orchestra won a prize in 1893 offered by\r\nthe National Conservatory of Music in New York City, of which Dvořák\r\nwas then director and in which the composer was a teacher; ‘The Holy\r\nChild,’ a Christmas cantata, was published in 1893; and ‘A Wanderer’s\r\nPsalm’ was written for and performed at the Hereford Festival, England,\r\nin 1900. A composition which finely illustrates his great ability in\r\nhandling problems of vocal counterpoint is his motet for double chorus\r\n_a cappella_, _Adstant angelorum chori_ (poem by Thomas à Kempis),\r\nwhich won the prize given by the Musical Art Society of New York City\r\nin 1898.\r\n\r\nMrs. H. H. A. Beach (b. 1867) has written several small choral works\r\nthat have found well-merited favor, among them ‘The Minstrel and the\r\nKing’ for tenor and baritone solos, male chorus and orchestra, ‘The\r\nRose of Avontown,’ a ballad for soprano solo and female chorus, ‘The\r\nChambered Nautilus’ for female chorus, and ‘Sylvania’ for mixed chorus.\r\n\r\nAmong other small choral works of serious content and fine workmanship\r\nbelonging to this period must be mentioned a fine motet by Arthur\r\nWhiting (b. 1861) for double chorus _a cappella_, ‘O God, my heart is\r\nready’ (words selected from the Psalms).\r\n\r\n\r\n                              FOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[71] Born 1857.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                               CHAPTER VII\r\n\r\n                     EARLY AND CLASSICAL ORATORIOS\r\n\r\n     Origin of oratorio in the sacred drama of Italy--Cavalieri:\r\n     ‘The Representation of Soul and Body’--Carissimi:\r\n     ‘Jephthah’--Scarlatti; Stradella; other early oratorio\r\n     writers--Development of oratorio in Germany; Passion-music\r\n     and its development; Schütz: ‘The Seven Last Words of\r\n     Christ’; ‘The Passion Oratorio’; ‘The Resurrection’--J.\r\n     S.

It always dealt with sacred\r\nsubjects (the modern oratorio, however, frequently concerns itself\r\nwith secular themes), it was almost always dramatic and its musical\r\napparatus consisted of the usual four solo voices and the chorus with\r\ninstrumental accompaniment.\r\n\r\nIn the liturgic drama of the Roman Church must be sought the origin\r\nof the oratorio, which, in a musically coherent form, appeared at\r\nabout the same time with the opera, as the spiritual counterpart of\r\nits secular companion, making a devotional and intellectual appeal in\r\nplace of the sensual. In the mediæval church two forms of the mass were\r\nin use side by side: the Roman office, which was mainly celebrated by\r\nthe priest, and the Gallican Mass, a freer form, in which the people\r\nlargely participated. Quite naturally the divergence between the two\r\nbecame marked and during the twelfth century the Gallican Mass was\r\nreformed with regard to lay participation. In order, however, that the\r\npeople, who were attached to a form in which they took so direct a\r\npart, might be compensated for this exclusion, dramatic representations\r\nwere devised, based on the Scriptures, all with reference to the great\r\nchurch festivals, especially that of Holy Week. In these the germ of\r\nthe idea of the oratorio is to be found. These dramatic representations\r\ntook the form of mysteries and miracle plays--dramatic versions of\r\nScriptural episodes, with music, both sacred and secular, introduced\r\nto heighten their effect--as well as moralities, in which Christian\r\nvirtues and mental qualities were treated allegorically. They included\r\nprocessionals of the type of the ancient _Festum Asinorum_ (‘The Ass’s\r\nFestival’), commemorating the flight of the Holy Family into Egypt,\r\nwhich was annually celebrated at Beauvais and Sens as early as the\r\ntwelfth century, and in which the celebrated carol, _Prose de l’Ane_\r\n(‘Hymn of the Ass’), still preserved, was the central feature.\r\n\r\nWith the monodic revolution which was inaugurated at the close of the\r\nsixteenth century and which marked the beginning of opera, the history\r\nof oratorio as a distinctly musical rather than a liturgic art-form may\r\nbe said to begin. The sacred musical drama was generally staged in the\r\nvestry or vestibule of church or convent--its ‘oratory’--and in course\r\nof time the term oratorio was applied to this music. In the oratory\r\nof St. Filippo Neri’s church in Rome (_S. Girolamo della Charità_)\r\nAnimuccia’s settings of _laudi spirituali_ (sacred songs of praise) had\r\nalready been sung in the sixteenth century; and the fact that these\r\nhymns were often used in connection with Biblical recitations is not\r\nwithout direct influence on the development of the form.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                   I\r\n\r\nYet it was not until the performance of Emilio del Cavalieri’s\r\n_Rappresentazione di anima e di corpo_ (Rome, in February, 1600), in\r\nwhich Time, Life, The World, Pleasure, Intellect, The Soul and The Body\r\nappeared, that the first actual oratorio was heard in germinal shape,\r\nduring the same year that witnessed the world _première_ of all opera\r\nwith Peri’s _Euridice_, which took place in Florence in December.\r\n\r\nThere was practically no difference in form between the first operas\r\nand the earliest oratorios, a statement borne out by the fact that\r\nDomenico Mazzocchi’s _Querimonia di S. Maria Maddelena_ rivalled\r\nMonteverdi’s _Lamento d’Arianna_ in popularity. Both opera and\r\noratorio were constructed, musically, in the self-same way. Both were\r\nmade up of recitative and arias, of choral and instrumental numbers,\r\nand both began with an overture. The angelic choruses of the first\r\noratorios were musically synonymous with the bacchic choruses of the\r\nearly operas. The difference between them lay only in the choice of\r\nsubject-matter. And throughout the seventeenth century this continued\r\nto be the case, speaking generally, despite a certain divergence\r\nof viewpoint which had already made itself felt. How ‘operatic’ in\r\ncharacter Cavalieri’s sacred score was, is proven by its composer’s\r\nemployment of children as _dramatis personæ_, by the division of his\r\nwork into acts, and by the use of worldly intermezzos, pantomimes\r\nand ballets. Interesting is the composer’s anticipation of Wagner at\r\nBayreuth in his stage directions relegating his orchestra to a place\r\n‘behind the scenes’ and out of sight. This orchestra, primitive in\r\ncharacter, consisted of a double lyre, a harpsichord, a large guitar\r\nand two flutes. The use of the violin was recommended, though it was\r\nnot insisted upon.\r\n\r\nCavalieri’s stage directions for the performance of his sacred drama\r\nare so interesting and throw so much light on the dramatic character of\r\nthe early oratorio that they are quoted here, nearly in full, from Dr.\r\nBurney’s ‘History of Music’:\r\n\r\n(1) ‘The words should be printed, with verses correctly arranged, the\r\nscenes numbered, and the characters of interlocutors specified.\r\n\r\n(2) ‘Instead of the Overture or Symphony to modern musical drama, a\r\nmadrigal is recommended, as a full piece, with all the parts doubled,\r\nand a greater number of instruments.\r\n\r\n(3) ‘When the curtain rises, two youths, who recite the Prologue,\r\nappear on the stage; and when they have done, Time, one of the\r\nCharacters in the Morality, comes on, and has the note with which he is\r\nto begin given him by the instrumental performers behind the scenes.\r\n\r\n(4) ‘The Chorus are to have a place allotted to them on the stage, part\r\nsitting and part standing, in sight of the principal characters; and,\r\nwhen they sing, they are to rise and be in motion, with proper gestures.\r\n\r\n(5) ‘Pleasure, another imaginary character, and two companions, are to\r\nhave instruments in their hands, on which they are to play while they\r\nsing and perform ritornelles.\r\n\r\n(6) ‘_Il Corpo_, the Body, when these words are uttered, _Si che hormia\r\nalma mia_, etc., may throw away some of his ornaments, as his gold\r\ncollar, feather from his hat, etc.\r\n\r\n(7) ‘The World and Human Life in particular, are to be gaily and richly\r\ndressed; and when they are divested of their trappings, to appear very\r\npoor and wretched, and at length dead carcasses.\r\n\r\n(8) ‘The Symphonies and Ritornelles may be played by a great number of\r\ninstruments; and, if a violin should play the principal part, it would\r\nhave a good effect.\r\n\r\n(9) ‘The performance may be finished with or without a dance. If\r\nwithout, the last chorus is to be doubled in all its parts, vocal and\r\ninstrumental; but, if a dance is preferred, a verse beginning thus:\r\n_Chiostri altissimi e stellati_, is to be sung, accompanied sedately\r\nand reverently by the dance. These shall succeed other grave steps and\r\nfigures of the solemn kind. During the ritornelles, the four principal\r\ndancers are to form a ballet, _saltato con capriole_, enlivened with\r\ncapers or _entrechats_, without singing, and thus, after each stanza,\r\nalways varying the steps of the dance; and the four principal dancers\r\nmay sometimes use the _galiard_, sometimes the _canary_, and sometimes\r\nthe _courant_ step, which will do very well in the ritornelles.\r\n\r\n(10) ‘The stanzas of the ballet are to be sung and played by all\r\nperformers within and without.’\r\n\r\nAs a matter of fact Cavalieri’s work was in reality a sacred opera,\r\nnot an oratorio. Contemporaries of Cavalieri, Agostino Manni\r\n(_Rappresentazione del Figliuol Prodigo_), Anerio (_Teatro armonico\r\nspirituale_), Pietro della Valle (_Esther_, _La Purificazione_) and,\r\nsomewhat later, Domenico Mazzocchi, Luigi Rossi, Ludovico Bellanda,\r\nVittorio Loreto (_La Pellegrina Constante_, _Sacre d’Abramo_),\r\nFrancesco Balducci (_La Fede_) and others, represent tentative gropings\r\ntoward a more artistically satisfying formal and musical development of\r\nthe oratorio.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                   II\r\n\r\nThe slow revival of choral art quite naturally found in sacred\r\nsubjects the material best suited to treatment, not alone because of\r\nearlier sixteenth century associations, but also because such subjects\r\ndid not over-encourage dramatic realism. Yet even Carissimi (1604-1674)\r\nhad but little success in his efforts to establish a loftier spiritual\r\nstandard in oratorio. He did much to perfect the recitative, and\r\nto add charm and variety to the instrumental accompaniment; he set\r\naside the theatrical presentation, often gave dramatic details to a\r\n‘narrator’ and laid more weight on the choral element. His music has\r\nreal quality and beauty; yet the secular idea persists in his works and\r\ndefeats his attempts to turn Scriptural dramatic representations into\r\ngenuine church-music. Despite this, his work is valuable as a stepping\r\nstone--he was the first to write music which held out hopes of a future\r\nfor the oratorio as a distinct art-form.\r\n\r\nGiacomo Carissimi, from 1628 to the time of his death choir-master of\r\nthe _Appolinare_ Church in Rome, was already renowned as a teacher and\r\ncomposer in 1650. It was in this year that Athanasius Kirchner, in\r\nhis celebrated _Musurgia universalis_, a quaint mixture of scientific\r\nknowledge and childish hearsay, introduced Carissimi, with an analysis\r\nof his _Jephta_, to a wider circle as the perfect oratorio-composer.\r\nNor is it without reason that Carissimi has been termed the Handel\r\nof the seventeenth century. His oratorios _Jonas_, _Jephta_, _Job_,\r\n_Diluvium universalis_, etc., he called _historie_, and the Biblical\r\ntext on which they were founded was liberally interspersed with poetic\r\nsupplementary matter to allow for the introduction of little arias and\r\nmartial, elegiac or popular incidental choruses. The text was still\r\nLatin, though after Carissimi’s time the _oratorio volgare_, so called\r\nbecause it was sung in Italian and was thus distinguished from the\r\nLatin oratorio, supplanted the latter in popular favor.\r\n\r\n_Jephta_ is, perhaps, Carissimi’s most characteristic work. It employs\r\na Biblical subject, like all his other works of the kind, for Carissimi\r\nadhered strictly to this conception of oratorio, though many of his\r\ncontemporaries shaped their cantatas and oratorios around the life\r\nof some saint. In _Jephta_, too, as in all the composer’s oratorios,\r\nthe musical stress is laid on the choruses. These are not written in\r\nthe style of the polyphonic madrigal, but in a simple chordal setting\r\nwhose rhythm is conditioned by the word-accents. The fugue is absent,\r\nimitation and canon are suggested only in the duets. In nearly all\r\ncases the chorus serves to develop the dramatic idea. In the oratorio\r\nof the time, chorus is, in general, opposed to chorus, with the\r\noccasional relief of solo voices. Yet Carissimi secures considerable\r\nmovement and variety by dividing more extended portions of his text\r\ninto short sections, first sung by one or more solo voices and then\r\ntaken up by the choruses _en masse_. Excellent examples of this\r\nprocedure are to be found in his _Diluvium universalis_ and _Dives\r\nmalus_.\r\n\r\nNaturally, the harmonic structure of _Jephta_ and the companion\r\noratorios of Carissimi seems almost pathetically simple to the\r\nmodern ear, accustomed to the richness of chromatic harmonization.\r\nHis modulations, save in a few instances, such as the chorus _Abit\r\nin montes_ of _Jephta_, are restricted to the keys of the upper and\r\nlower dominant. This lack, however, was not perceptible to listeners\r\nof the composer’s own generation. They enjoyed the rhythmic vitality\r\nand dramatic truth of his works, the vivid descriptive quality of\r\nthe shipwreck music in _Jonas_, the idyllic charm of the two-voice\r\nmovements to which the playmates of Jephthah’s daughter dance their\r\nrounds. And in _Jephta_ the composer often gained a depth of pathos\r\nworthy of a really great singer’s rendering. Such a number is the\r\n_Plorate colles_, a model of expressive writing. It was from this\r\n_Plorate_ that Handel borrowed twelve measures to use in ‘Hear, Jacob’s\r\nGod,’ in his ‘Samson.’\r\n\r\nAll in all, Carissimi may be held to have laid down the lines along\r\nwhich the Handelian oratorio was later to develop. As a contrapuntal\r\nwriter his great merit lay in the adaptation of the polyphonic idea\r\nto the new conceptions of tonality. He stands for the introduction of\r\na more serious musicianship in oratorio work, and his influence was\r\nnoticeably great and made itself felt in the works of his successors\r\nup to Handel’s time. Among these men who carried on his work (though\r\noften they were mainly active in the operatic or instrumental fields),\r\ntwo in particular stand forth, Alessandro Stradella (d. 1681) and\r\nAlessandro Scarlatti (d. 1725). These two men, in a manner, sum up\r\nthe activity of many others, of Provencale, Vitali, Colonna, Leonardo\r\nLeo, G. B. Bononcini, Bassani, Ristocchi and Polaroli in Italy; of the\r\nItalian musicians in Vienna--Bertali, Draghi, Ariosto, Badia and M. A.\r\nBononcini; and in Munich, Pietro Tosi. All of these composers wrote\r\noratorios between the years 1650 and 1750 and developed in them the\r\nprinciples of Carissimi with more or less originality and success.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                   III\r\n\r\nAlessandro Scarlatti, born in 1659 in Trapani, Sicily, the greatest\r\nrepresentative of the Neapolitan school, was, it is asserted, a pupil\r\nof Carissimi. He wrote operas, cantatas, vocal and instrumental pieces\r\nby the hundred, and his oratorios alone number fourteen. Their titles\r\nshow that he departed from his master’s strict adherence to Biblical\r\nsubjects for his textual material. We have a _Maddalena penitente_,\r\na _Sacrificio d’Abramo_, _Agar et Ismaele esiliati_, it is true,\r\nbut also a _San Casimiro, rè di Polonia_, and a _S. Filippo Neri_.\r\nLike Carissimi he subordinated strict thematic counterpoint to the\r\nexigencies of a free and unconstrained leading of the voices, and with\r\nan added richness and elaboration of effect. He gave the aria a more\r\ndefinite structure, and made large use of rhythmic melody, in the\r\nmanner of Gluck, to bring out the dramatic value of highly impassioned\r\nscenes, which in spoken drama would have appeared as monologue. Where\r\nlesser depths of feeling were to be plumbed, he used accompanied\r\nrecitative and the _recitativo secco_ mainly for the development of the\r\nnarrative itself. This general scheme of arrangement has been followed\r\nby later composers down to our own day.\r\n\r\nPerhaps his oratorio _Il trionfo della grazia_, composed in 1685, which\r\nwas a favorite as late as the early years of the eighteenth century,\r\ngives us as good a general idea of his sacred music as any other. It\r\nwas also known under the title of _La Conversione di Maddalena_, as in\r\nit the Magdalen makes her appearance as a species of apple of discord\r\nbetween ‘Youth’ and ‘Penitence.’ In clever contrast such opposites\r\nas Gravity and Heedlessness, The World’s Curse and The Joy of Life,\r\nare used to enhance the moral and musical effect of the work. The\r\nsecond section of the oratorio takes up the conversion of the penitent\r\nsinner, and the music which the Magdalen now sings, full of pathos and\r\ngravity, offers a piquant contrast to the jolly melodies, embroidered\r\nwith coloratura and shakes, which were her part before. Particularly\r\nbeautiful is an instrumental symphony (in the older sense of the word)\r\nwhich, after the heroine has said the words, ‘A penitent and faithful\r\nheart shall see the heavens open,’ is wonderfully suggestive of the\r\nkneeling of the penitent woman. Schering calls it a musical pendant to\r\nRibera’s celebrated picture of St. Agnes, in the Dresden galleries.\r\n\r\nIn another of Scarlatti’s oratorios, _Sedecia, rè di Gerusalemme_[72]\r\n(1706), we meet with a splendidly effective use of orchestral\r\nmeans--always remembering that the orchestra of that day was not our\r\npresent one. The introductory _sinffonie_ is here nothing more or less\r\nthan a violin concerto[73] in disguise, and the orchestra--consisting\r\nof obbligato and second violins, trumpets, tympani (especially\r\nprominent in the military music in Part I of the work) and oboes--takes\r\nan important part in the musical development from beginning to end.\r\nAmong the vocal numbers might be instanced a particularly expressive\r\nduo between Anna and her son Ishmael (accompanied by an obbligato\r\noboe); an aria of Ishmael’s, accompanied by two solo violins, and\r\nSedecia’s two arias in Part II.\r\n\r\nIn this oratorio in particular, Scarlatti speaks with the accents of\r\na master who is consciously striving toward the realization of a new\r\nideal. It offers striking proof of the fact of how great Scarlatti\r\nmight have become as a composer of oratorio had not opera so largely\r\npreëmpted his best efforts. The closing movement of _Sedecia_, a\r\nfive-part chorus on broad lines, with incidental solo-quartet sections,\r\nrecalls in its style the magnificent triumphal choruses of Handel’s\r\noratorios. _S. Casimiro, rè di Polonia_ (1713) also contains arias of\r\ngreat beauty; and written during the master’s last period of creative\r\nactivity, _La Vergine addolorata_ (1717) must be considered one of\r\nhis finest works. A ‘Lament of Mary’ printed by Raf. Carreras in his\r\n_El Oratorio Musical_ (1906), p. 188, approaches Bach in power and\r\nexpressiveness.\r\n\r\nThe austere and serious power which Scarlatti infused into his sacred\r\nmusic was not attained by his immediate successors and contemporaries.\r\nBut the master’s predilection for brilliancy and effect, when we\r\ncompare his music with that of Purcell, though its greater dramatic\r\ninterest and movement is incontestable, brought about, perhaps, a\r\nless degree of emotional expression and a less intimate touch in the\r\nportrayal of mood pictures.\r\n\r\nAlessandro Stradella, born in Naples about 1645, was not as prolific a\r\nwriter as Scarlatti, yet he left over 150 works (among them ten operas\r\nand eight oratorios) at the time of his early death--he is supposed\r\nto have been murdered in Genoa in 1681. He has much in common with\r\nScarlatti. In Stradella’s works we find the same recurring suggestion\r\nof Handelian breadth and strength, and in general that freedom and\r\ngrandeur of conceptive outlook which stamps the great composer.\r\n\r\nStradella’s best known oratorio is his _S. Giovanni Battista_ (about\r\n1676). Its great artistic merit lies in its plastic musical portrayals\r\nof the characters of Herod and his daughter, and in the happy use\r\nof fiery, dramatic melody to limn them in tone; for as a musical\r\ncharacter-painter Stradella may be said to have been Scarlatti’s\r\nsuperior, although his influence on the development of the form was\r\nnot so great as was that of his contemporary. The romantic details\r\nregarding his personal life, many of them undoubtedly apocryphal, which\r\nrecur in every biography, do not seem to call for consideration here.\r\nIt is his contribution to the music of the oratorio only with which we\r\nare concerned, and in this respect he deserves a place beside Scarlatti.\r\n\r\nThe numerous composers of oratorio who lead from Carissimi, through\r\nScarlatti and Stradella, to Handel and his more immediate German\r\npredecessors, have nothing especially new to offer. Scarlatti and\r\nStradella accomplished much in the direction of both musical and purely\r\nformal development, but they were unable to establish a distinct\r\nline of demarcation between oratorio and opera. Italian oratorio was\r\npractically not distinguishable from the Italian _opera seria_ until as\r\nlate as Mozart’s boyhood.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                   IV\r\n\r\nItalian oratorio, by reason of its descent from the sacred church\r\ndramas and its close association with opera, has never been wholly able\r\nto break away from the element of recreation that was so conspicuous\r\nin its early use as a means of attracting people to attend church. And\r\nthe complete separation between the recreational and religious elements\r\ndid not take place until the oratorio passed out of the land of its\r\nbirth into Germany, when it fused with the spirit of Passion-music and\r\nemerged a distinctly religious art-form. The connecting link between\r\nItalian oratorio and Germany was Giovanni Gabrieli, who, as the teacher\r\nof Heinrich Schütz, the greatest German musician of the seventeenth\r\ncentury, transmitted to his great pupil not only his technical mastery\r\nof the best of Netherland and Italian art-methods, but his own\r\nremarkable artistic sincerity and religious earnestness. It was Schütz\r\nwho, from the different standpoint of Protestant faith as nurtured by\r\nthe Lutheran Reformation, laid the foundations of modern oratorio.\r\n\r\nBefore tracing the influence of Schütz in shaping the future course\r\nof oratorio, it will be in place to sketch the origin and development\r\nof the Passion-music. The quasi-dramatic musical presentation of the\r\nPassion[74] is even more deeply rooted in the liturgy of the Roman\r\nChurch than is the oratorio. It represents the artistic amplification\r\nof the reading of the Passion of our Lord, according to the evangels\r\nas prescribed by the church during Holy Week: on Palm Sunday the\r\nPassion according to St. Matthew, on Tuesday, St. Mark, on Wednesday,\r\nSt. Luke, and on Good Friday, St. John. At an early period it had\r\nbecome customary to assign the narrative text and the words of Christ,\r\nof the Apostles, the High Priest and other individual characters to\r\nvarious singers, instead of having them read. During the period of the\r\nsupremacy of Gregorian plain-song this mode of rendering this part of\r\nthe liturgy resulted in the Passion chant (_cantus passionis_). This\r\ncontinued to be the only form used until the principles of polyphony\r\nwere sufficiently developed to substitute a more elaborate form.\r\nSince the year 1200 and probably much earlier, the texts to be sung\r\nwere divided among three priests, called ‘Deacons of the Passion,’ as\r\nfollows: one chanted the words of Christ, another the narration of\r\nthe Evangelist and a third the words of the apostles, the crowd, or\r\nothers whose words are recorded. Passion-music, it will be observed, is\r\nmuch older than the oratorio and at the time that the latter began to\r\nassume shape and coherence, it already could boast of a considerable\r\nliterature. When the monodic revolution brought about the development\r\nof the oratorio along lines similar to those of opera and encouraged\r\nthe use of legends of the saints and Christian allegory as text matter,\r\nthe Passion remained strictly bound to its original Biblical text,\r\nalthough the musical treatment of certain text portions in motet form\r\n(Passion Motets) was permitted. Not until the second half of the\r\nseventeenth century did Passion and oratorio in Italy draw near to each\r\nother, and only in the last quarter of the century was the story of\r\nthe Passion utilized for the first time as subject-matter for a great\r\noratorio.\r\n\r\nAttilio Ariosti’s _Passione_ (1693) is probably the first work of\r\nits kind in Italy to present this subject with due dramatic emphasis\r\nand the use of musically adequate popular choruses. G. A. Perti’s\r\n_Passione_ (1685), on the other hand, is one of the type known\r\nas _sepolcros_, intended for devotional performance at a richly\r\ndecorated Holy Sepulchre and serving principally as an excuse for\r\ntearfully exaggerated scenes of sorrow between Mary Magdalene and the\r\ndisciples. After Ariosti’s _Passione_ Italian Passion music in its best\r\nmanifestations may be said to have been taken over into the oratorio\r\nproper, with little but its text to distinguish it from the latter.\r\n\r\nWhen Luther constructed the liturgy of the Church which followed his\r\nreligious leadership, he borrowed from the Roman ritual, among other\r\nthings, the custom of singing to musical accompaniment the story of the\r\ntrial and death of the Saviour. About the middle of the seventeenth\r\ncentury German composers[75] injected into the existing Italian form\r\na new spiritual and musical fervor, and an emotional expressiveness\r\nwhich was eventually to culminate in the great Passions of Johann\r\nSebastian Bach. By the end of the seventeenth century the Passion\r\nexisted in three distinct forms--the chant, the motet and the oratorio.\r\nSchütz cultivated particularly the last two forms with wonderful\r\nresults considering the musical vocabulary of his period, but the\r\nPassion-oratorio, with its greater musical and dramatic possibilities,\r\nwas best adapted to serve the deep religious fervor of Bach’s\r\ninspiration and to attain its final development at his hands.\r\n\r\nHeinrich Schütz (1585-1672), of Dresden, was the greatest of Bach’s\r\npredecessors as a composer of church-music. Familiar with the best\r\nmusic of Italy and a master of religious writing, he laid the\r\nfoundation of the modern German oratorio. His ‘Resurrection,’ ‘Seven\r\nLast Words,’ and four ‘Passions’ represent the culmination of the\r\nform before Bach. Schütz, who has been called ‘the father of German\r\nmusic,’ was one of the greatest Psalm-writers of all times, though\r\nfew of these compositions are so named but appear under such titles\r\nas ‘spiritual concertos,’ ‘sacred symphonies,’ motets, and ‘sacred\r\nchoral music.’ Though his work was based on the Italian style, he was\r\ngreatly influenced by Scandellus, one of his predecessors in Dresden as\r\nchapel-master of the Elector Johann Georg of Saxony. His finest choral\r\nworks are the six mentioned above, all of which come under the general\r\nclassification of oratorios. One of his greatest works, _Historia der\r\nfröhlichen und siegreichen Auferstehung unseres einigen Erlösers und\r\nSeligmachers Jesu Christi_, or ‘Resurrection,’ was written in 1623,\r\nfor Easter service, it being the custom then, as now, in some of the\r\nimportant churches of Saxony, to sing the Resurrection on Easter day\r\nbefore the sermon, just as the Passion was sung on Good Friday. The\r\nvocal parts are accompanied by the organ and four _viole da gamba_, and\r\nthe chorus is frequently in six and eight parts. The works of Schütz\r\nare characterized by simplicity of themes, which are always expressive\r\nand full of color. At times he becomes dramatic, but he is always\r\ndevotional and reverential, and though he abandons the liturgical\r\nforms of Scandellus, many of his themes, though original, are based\r\non liturgical melody or Gregorian chant. All trace of the Italian\r\nrecreational element disappears; there is no suggestion of the stage\r\nor of ‘attractive’ effects and the only object before the composer’s\r\nmind is evidently to faithfully portray in music the solemnity and\r\npious grandeur of the texts. This was the point of departure for German\r\nProtestant oratorio.\r\n\r\nAnother important work of Schütz was his setting of the ‘Seven Words\r\nof Jesus,’ written and performed in 1645. This departs even more from\r\nthe liturgical chant, and the part of the Evangelist, instead of being\r\nchanted, is treated as a recitative, first for alto, then for tenor,\r\nthen for soprano and tenor accompanied by the other two voices, thus\r\nbringing it into quartet form. The first and last choruses are in five\r\nparts and each is called ‘Chorus of the Congregation.’ After the first\r\nchorus and before the last (therefore separating the actual scenes from\r\nthe chorus of the people), an instrumental number called _symphonia_ is\r\ninserted, thereby giving more dramatic force to the narration. These\r\ntwo symphonias are in five parts and while the instruments are not\r\nindicated, they were probably played by the strings. Parts of the work\r\nare very touching and beautifully expressive. For some unknown reason\r\nthis work was not published until 1873 (228 years after its first\r\nproduction), edited by Carl Riedel.\r\n\r\nPossibly his greatest work is his setting of the four Passions entitled\r\n_Historia des Leidens und Sterbens unseres Herrn und Heylandes Jesu\r\nChristi_ and following the text of the four Evangelists. This was\r\nwritten in 1665-66 but was not published during his lifetime and only\r\nthe ‘St. John Passion’ exists in manuscript, but a complete copy of\r\nthe four Passions was made by Grundig in 1690, comparatively soon\r\nafter the death of Schütz. These Passions are built up largely with\r\nshort choruses which, though conceived in deep devotion, are at times\r\nvery dramatic. The parts not given to the chorus are recitatives in\r\nliturgical form, sometimes accompanied[76] and sometimes for the voice\r\nalone. The texts of some of the choruses were taken from well-known\r\nchurch hymns. The ‘St. Matthew Passion’ is the most fluent melodically.\r\nThese settings of the Passion comprised the composer’s last works and\r\nin them lay the kernel of what was later perfected by Bach and Handel,\r\nboth of whom completed in their respective lines what Schütz had begun.\r\nIt has been regarded significant that the year of his birth was exactly\r\none hundred years before that of Bach and Handel.\r\n\r\nSchütz was still much under the influence of the Gregorian modes\r\nand did not attempt to break away from them in passages of simple\r\nrecitative, but he also employed for simple harmonized passages many\r\nof the chorale melodies that were so popular all over Protestant\r\nGermany. But after Schütz plain-song practically disappears from German\r\nPassion and oratorio music and the influence of the chorale becomes\r\nmore distinct and insistent. During the seventeenth and eighteenth\r\ncenturies Passion music was extensively cultivated in Germany and\r\nall her best composers gave it marked attention. Johann Sebastiani\r\nin 1672 produced a Passion at Königsberg, in which the narration is\r\nset entirely to original music and in which chorales, simply and\r\neffectively harmonized, are given more prominence. Thenceforward German\r\nchurch-music, freed from its allegiance to the old modal system, struck\r\nout paths of its own, and rapid progress was made. In 1673 Theile’s\r\n_Deutsche Passion_ was performed at Lübeck with extraordinary success\r\nand Reinhard Keiser, the Hamburg opera-composer, created renewed\r\ninterest in this form by his setting of the Passion in 1704, which\r\ncontained an innovation followed by all subsequent German writers of\r\nPassion-music. This consisted in what he called _soliloquia_, which\r\nvoiced devout reflections on the solemn events of the Gospel narrative.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                   V\r\n\r\nBach’s extraordinary and single-hearted devotion to the cause of\r\nchurch-music led him very naturally to the door of Passion-music and\r\noratorio, and he brought to the composition of these elaborate forms\r\nan unequalled mastery over all the technical devices of contrapuntal\r\nwriting and a marvellous fertility of invention. A deeply religious\r\nand devout nature enriched the natural nobility of his musical speech,\r\nand scattered through the four oratorios from his pen that are\r\npreserved to us are some of his sublimest thoughts. These four are a\r\nChristmas-oratorio and three Passion-oratories--St. Matthew, St. John,\r\nand St. Luke (now regarded as genuine, though for many years considered\r\nspurious). Through the carelessness of his son Friedemann a St. Mark\r\nPassion and probably still another have been lost, for he is known to\r\nhave written five Passions.\r\n\r\n‘Christmas Oratorio.’--This work, written in 1723 and performed a\r\nyear later, consists of six parts (in reality six separate cantatas)\r\nintended for the first, second and third days of the Christmas service,\r\nfor New Year’s Day, New Year’s Sunday and Epiphany. While these belong\r\ntogether liturgically and are connected by chorales, there have been\r\nvery few single performances of the entire work because of its very\r\ngreat length. The parts given most frequently are the first two, which\r\nare the strongest. The text, the story of the Nativity, is taken from\r\nMatthew and Luke, but is elaborated by passages taken from two of his\r\nsecular works. This was a common procedure in the eighteenth century\r\nand as Bach had just written festival music for the birthday of the\r\nQueen of Poland and for other court festivities, parts of these joyful\r\ncompositions easily adapted themselves to the joy of the Christmas\r\nseason.\r\n\r\nThe first part opens with a sort of fanfare of trumpets accompanied\r\nby drums, which gives a distinct festival atmosphere as the people\r\nassemble for the first service; it is followed at once by the chorus\r\n_Jauchzet, frohlocket, auf, preisset die Tage_. The solo tenor narrates\r\nthe part of the Evangelist and brings the attention of the worshippers\r\nto the joy of this specific festival. But Bach sees beyond the Nativity\r\nand anticipates the sacrifice and suffering of the Saviour, therefore\r\nthe words of the Advent hymn, _Wie soll ich dich empfangen_, are set to\r\nthe Passion chorale, _O Haupt voll Blut und Wunden_. This first part\r\ncontains beautiful, simple melodies interspersed with chorales. An\r\natmosphere, almost of Advent sorrow, pervades the part as a whole and\r\nis strongly contrasted with the second part which brings in the real,\r\ngenerally-accepted Christmas atmosphere. The second part opens with the\r\nwell-known ‘Pastoral Symphony,’ so often played on orchestral programs\r\nand so charmingly idyllic, simple and naïve. It is built on two themes,\r\none typical of the shepherds, the other of the angels. At the close\r\nof this the Evangelist continues his narrative, which is frequently\r\ninterrupted by lyric passages and by chorales, such as _Brich an, du\r\nschönes Morgenlicht_. The beautiful tenor solo, _Frohe Hirten eilt_,\r\nfollowing a bass recitative, is one of the most compelling numbers, but\r\nprobably the finest from both a vocal and an orchestral standpoint is\r\nthe lovely alto solo, _Schlafe, mein Liebster_. The part closes with\r\na massive chorus of praise to God in the highest, sung by the angels,\r\nshepherds and the congregation.\r\n\r\nAs the other four parts are rarely performed, no detailed analysis is\r\ngiven here; however, these parts have been given together and are about\r\nas long as the combined first two parts. One of the most effective\r\nchoruses in the last four parts is one in the fifth, _Ehre sei dir Gott\r\ngesungen_.\r\n\r\n‘Passion According to St. Matthew.’--This stupendous work, now\r\nuniversally considered the finest work of its kind, was written in 1729\r\nand performed on April 15th of the same year at the afternoon service\r\nof Good Friday in the St. Thomas Church, Leipzig, but was later altered\r\nand extended so that it was not completed in its present form until\r\n1740. While it was frequently performed in Leipzig until the end of\r\nthe eighteenth century, it was practically forgotten by the outside\r\nworld until 1829, just one hundred years after its first production,\r\nwhen it was given on March 11th, in the _Singakademie_, Berlin, under\r\nthe direction of Mendelssohn. This generous artist is deserving of\r\nthe deepest gratitude for his untiring enthusiasm in compelling the\r\nworld to recognize the grandeur of this work and the greatness of\r\nits half-forgotten creator. He was evidently deeply struck with the\r\nstrangeness of his own relation to the rescuing of the great work from\r\noblivion, for, in commenting on the performance, he made the following\r\nreference to his own nationality--the only recorded instance of this\r\nkind: ‘It was an actor[77] and a Jew who restored this great Christian\r\nwork to the people.’ It was not performed in London until April 6th,\r\n1854. The first American performance was by the Handel and Haydn\r\nSociety in Boston in 1874.\r\n\r\nThe story of the ‘Passion according to St. Matthew’ was already\r\nembodied in the service at Leipzig and it was sung on Palm Sunday each\r\nyear in choral form. The fact that the Passions were regularly given\r\nat church services, added to his own interest in the subject itself,\r\nprobably inspired Bach to give artistic musical expression to the\r\ndifferent versions of the Gospel narratives. While Bach wrote five\r\nPassions, four on the four Gospels and one by Picander, the greatest\r\nand last was the ‘Matthew Passion.’ The ‘Passion according to St. Luke’\r\nis by many authorities not attributed entirely to Bach, for even though\r\nit were a youthful work, there are parts that cannot be reconciled with\r\nhis general style of that period, though others bear his unmistakable\r\nstamp. Of the ‘Passion according to St. Mark’ only five lyric pieces\r\nare preserved in the Funeral Ode on the death of Queen Christiane\r\nEberhardine. The Picander Passion is lost. The ‘Passion according\r\nto St. John’ was first performed at St. Thomas’ Church on April\r\n7th, 1724, and is musically not much inferior to the great ‘Matthew\r\nPassion,’ but in the latter work Bach developed to a larger extent\r\nthe element characteristic of the oratorio and united more closely\r\nthe ecclesiastical and the folk-song quality. The fact that he was\r\naccustomed to the simple choral setting probably prevented him from\r\ngiving anything like conscious dramatic effect, yet the complexity\r\nof his natural musical expression often led him to a dramatic climax\r\nof which he was not conscious, for his Passions were written for the\r\nchurch service only. As Bach was above all a devout Lutheran, he\r\ndoubtless was imbued with the spirit of offsetting the grandeur of\r\nthe Roman Mass with the combination of simple and complex forms in\r\nwhich the congregation could take part in the well-known chorales\r\ninterspersed so artistically. Arthur Mees[78] speaks of Bach’s Passions\r\nas ‘the expression of the religious devotion of his own individual self\r\nas representative of his fellow-believers. Even the dramatic portions\r\nare not the utterances of actors in a drama, but those of the Christian\r\ncongregation which is carried away in its contemplation of the events\r\nto the point of identifying itself with the actual participants in the\r\nscene.’\r\n\r\nBetween the two parts of the Passion it was customary in Bach’s time\r\nto have the sermon, as in the days of St. Philip Neri at Rome. As the\r\nperformance of the Passion consumed more than two hours and the sermon\r\nlasted at least two hours, the Good Friday service was a most serious\r\nand weighty church event.\r\n\r\nThe first part of the ‘Matthew Passion’ is divided into three\r\nprincipal sections--Jesus with his disciples and the institution of\r\nthe Last Supper, Jesus at Gethsemane, and the seizure of Jesus. The\r\nsecond part is divided into four sections--Jesus before the High\r\nPriest, Jesus before Pilate, the Crucifixion, and the last, consisting\r\nof madrigal-like elaborations of Bible texts. This part contains the\r\nfamous bass aria, _Am Abend als es kühle ward_, which with its refined\r\ninstrumentation is one of the most beautiful in the entire work, almost\r\nromantic in atmosphere and remarkably lyric. Among the many notable\r\ncharacteristics of this work is the accompanying of the words of Jesus\r\nby the orchestra in place of the usual _continuo_. The Daughter of\r\nZion, whose words were given by other composers to a definite voice,\r\nno longer appears as an individual, but her words are sung in turn by\r\nalto, soprano, tenor and bass solos, in duets and in choral form.\r\n\r\nWhile a large part of the text (from chapters XXVI and XXVII of\r\nMatthew’s Gospel) was doubtless compiled by Bach himself, he had able\r\nassistance from the poet Picander (whose real name was Friedrich\r\nHenrici), who wrote many of the hymns and who has already been referred\r\nto as the poet of the lost Passion, considered of little value because\r\nof the inadequacy of the text.\r\n\r\nWith Bach’s ‘Matthew Passion’ the development of the Protestant Church\r\nmusic in this form came to an abrupt close for the simple reason that\r\nno one since Bach’s time has possessed the necessary technical and\r\nmusical equipment for further progress. In this glorious work, which\r\nnext to his own ‘B minor Mass’ is probably his most sublime utterance,\r\nhe seems to have completely grasped the touching pathos and the\r\npoignant sorrow of the scenes unfolded in the Gospel narratives of the\r\nPassion and, in interpreting them through the religious experience of a\r\ndevout believer, to have exhausted the vocabulary of music appropriate\r\nto the liturgy of which this Scriptural narrative forms an impressive\r\npart. However, other Passions were written after Bach’s settings were\r\nmade and the most famous of them is Graun’s _Der Tod Jesu_, which\r\nis spoken of in some detail below. Handel made two settings of the\r\nPassion, one of which (‘The Passion of Christ’ to a poem by B. H.\r\nBrockes of Hamburg) is in existence. It was written probably about 1716\r\nand the composer introduced no fewer than twenty of its numbers into\r\nlater works, some altered, some transferred bodily. Haydn’s Passion\r\n(‘The Seven Words of Our Saviour’) has already been spoken of under\r\ncantatas (Chapter IV). An interesting example of later Passion music\r\nis Gounod’s unaccompanied Passion-motet, ‘The Seven Last Words of Our\r\nSaviour’ (_Filiæ Jerusalem_), written from the standpoint of the Roman\r\nChurch service in the style of Palestrina.\r\n\r\nKarl Heinrich Graun (1701-1759), a contemporary of Bach, was the\r\nlast great writer of Passion music. Indeed, the greatest of his works\r\nwas the Passion-cantata ‘The Death of Jesus,’ text by Ramler, which\r\nmet with the most monumental success and has been a favorite up to\r\nthe present day. Performed for the first time on March 26th, 1763, in\r\nthe Cathedral of Berlin (four years after the death of the composer),\r\nit was published immediately and both orchestral and piano scores\r\npassed through edition after edition, and the work obtained a very\r\nwide hearing. In many places an annual performance of it was given\r\nand it was as well known as the ‘Messiah,’ ‘The Creation’ and the\r\nMozart _Requiem_. Although Graun was first of all a contrapuntist,\r\nhis harmony was rich and expressive and his style often dramatic. As\r\nhe was himself an opera singer of splendid attainments, he understood\r\nhow to produce the best vocal effects. His melodies, if judged from\r\nthe standpoint of the time in which they were written, are very\r\nexpressive, though present-day standards would not pronounce them\r\nalways forceful. This may be partly due to the text, which, though\r\nsuited to the demands of the time, is not always pliable. Graun, like\r\nall German Passion composers of this period, made frequent use of the\r\nchorale, sometimes for purposes of narration and sometimes to express\r\nthe thought of the people. The _dramatis personæ_ are not well defined\r\nin the text, hence it is difficult to discern who is speaking, since\r\nchorus, solos and chorales serve for different functions. Frederick\r\nthe Great somewhat humorously spoke of this work as ‘Graun’s best\r\nopera’ and there is considerable justification for the statement,\r\nespecially when considered in connection with the two principal bass\r\narias--one, which comes near the close, ‘Now suddenly by anguish long\r\nrestrained,’ and the other, which is by far the highest dramatic point\r\nin the work, ‘Jerusalem, for slaughter thirsting.’ The latter is most\r\neffective, even judged by present-day standards, and has an elaborate\r\naccompaniment. This is followed by the chorus, ‘Christ unto us hath\r\nleft an example,’ in double fugue, the vocal effects of which have made\r\nit successful in spite of the commonplace themes employed. This is so\r\nwell-known that it is often sung by choirs as a separate composition.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                   VI\r\n\r\nThe law of compensation has seldom operated so magnificently to the\r\nadvantage of a great artist defeated in a cherished life enterprise,\r\nas in the case of Handel. Rejoicing in the reputation of being one of\r\nthe greatest opera composers of his time, he might easily have spent\r\nthe whole productive period of his life in winning the applause of the\r\npleasure-loving opera audiences who regarded the glitter and tinsel of\r\nItalian opera as the _summum bonum_ of artistic expression. Fortunately\r\nfor Handel himself and for the art of music, he was compelled to\r\ngive up his career as an opera composer and manager because of the\r\njealousy of rivals, the cabals and intrigues of court-cliques and the\r\nfinancial embarrassments brought about by combinations of unpleasant\r\ncircumstances. It was only after he was fifty years old that he\r\nbegan to write the works that have immortalized him. Several of his\r\nearly oratorios--‘Esther’ (1718 and 1732), ‘Deborah’ (1733) and\r\n‘Athaliah’ (1733)--had met with great success and popular approval,\r\npart of which was no doubt attributable to the unbounded admiration\r\naroused by his performances on the organ between the parts of his\r\noratorios. Practically driven from the operatic stage by adverse\r\ncircumstances--and all of his operas are forgotten now--he eagerly\r\nturned to the more appreciative English oratorio audiences. It was\r\nthis English love for the sacred drama that encouraged Handel to\r\nabandon stage composition (1741) and to give full expression to the\r\ndeeper things of his rugged, independent, sincere nature through the\r\nhighest forms of religious music. The result was the production of the\r\nstupendous series of oratorios on which his fame now almost wholly\r\nrests. ‘Saul’ and ‘Israel in Egypt’ were both performed in 1739, and\r\nin 1742 the immortal ‘Messiah’ was given to the world. The enthusiasm\r\nwith which this great work was received stimulated him to renewed\r\nactivity along the same line and after the ‘Messiah’ came ‘Samson’ and\r\nthe ‘Dettingen Te Deum,’ performed in 1743; ‘Semele’ and ‘Joseph,’\r\nperformed in 1744; ‘Belshazzar’ and ‘Heracles’ in 1745; the ‘Occasional\r\nOratorio’ and ‘Judas Maccabæus’ in 1747; ‘Joshua’ in 1748, ‘Solomon’\r\nand ‘Susannah’ in 1749, ‘Theodora’ in 1750, ‘The Choice of Hercules’\r\nin 1750, and ‘Jephthah,’ his last oratorio, in 1752. During the\r\ncomposition of ‘Jephthah,’ his failing eyesight became so troublesome\r\nthat he submitted to several operations for cataract, which, however,\r\nwere unsuccessful and total blindness ensued.\r\n\r\nDuring the period of about twenty years in which Handel’s oratorios\r\nwere written, the oratorio itself passed through practically all\r\nthe phases of development from the simple form in which Carissimi\r\nleft it to the massive structure of his (Handel’s) later oratorios.\r\nDuring this period he had practically no competition; indeed, in\r\nthe field of concert oratorio there is no one between Carissimi and\r\nHaydn who approaches him in greatness. The early Italian oratorio\r\n(including Handel’s earliest ones) consisted largely of vocal solos\r\nin the prevalent Italian operatic style. Scant attention was given\r\nto the chorus. As Handel delivered himself more and more in this\r\nform, he drew the line of demarcation more clearly between oratorio\r\nand opera. He elevated the chorus to an exalted position as the most\r\neffective and characteristic medium for the utterance of the sublime\r\nand epic thoughts so appropriate to the oratorio, and this feature\r\nhas been largely maintained in oratorio since Handel’s time. To be\r\nsure, he frequently employed a distinctly operatic style (as in the\r\nfamiliar aria ‘Rejoice greatly’ from the ‘Messiah’), but in general\r\nhe differentiated between the two forms and firmly established the\r\npermanent lines on which modern oratorio has developed. It should be\r\nborne in mind that oratorio is not, and never has been, church-music,\r\nbut concert-music. Its first use, though frequently associated with\r\nchurch services, was distinctly extra-liturgical. It is not even\r\nnecessarily religious music and it is worthy of note in this connection\r\nthat the majority of Handel’s choral works are secular. Several of\r\nhis early oratorios--‘Esther’ and ‘Deborah,’ as well as the serenata,\r\n‘Acis and Galatea’--were performed, as was the early custom in Italy,\r\nwith costume and stage scenery and action. English church authorities\r\nfrowned on this practice, however, and Handel discontinued it, but\r\nhe retained the dramatic element throughout all of his career as an\r\noratorio writer; in fact ‘Samson’ possesses so much real dramatic\r\naction that it might well be staged for full operatic performance.\r\n\r\nHandel’s oratorio style differed sharply from Bach’s in that it\r\nwas less severe and more distinctly vocal. His long experience in\r\nwriting for the stage led him instinctively to assume a more direct\r\nand intimate form of musical speech than that adopted by the great\r\nCantor in his church-music. Next to Bach he was the greatest master\r\nof counterpoint of his time and many of his choruses are perfect\r\nexamples of vocal fugue, but he depended far more than did Bach upon\r\nsolid chord-movement for some of his most massive and grandiose\r\neffects. His general choral style represents a happy combination of the\r\nhomophonic and contrapuntal principles, both operating in the immediate\r\ninterests of expressive dramatic utterance, as witness the magnificent\r\n‘Hallelujah’ chorus in the ‘Messiah.’ Deeply expressive arias, often\r\nwith folk-song simplicity of melody, and massive, highly organized and\r\noften elaborately constructed contrapuntal choruses are the two salient\r\nmusical features of his best oratorio style.\r\n\r\n‘Messiah.’--Probably no other musical composition is held in such\r\nuniversal affection as is Handel’s ‘Messiah’ and its popularity (in the\r\nbest sense of the word) seems to increase with the years. Performances\r\nof it have steadily become more and more frequent during the last fifty\r\nyears and with many choral societies in America, England and Germany,\r\nit has become an annual musical event at the Christmas season, though\r\njust why this particular season should have been chosen, it would\r\nbe hard to say. Not only was Handel in many respects the greatest\r\nof oratorio writers, but this oratorio was his greatest work, free\r\nfrom traditions or limitations. It was written to a text which he\r\nhimself selected from the Bible, though it was arranged by Charles\r\nJennens, who had previously collaborated with him on _L’Allegro_.\r\nThe very conception of the work itself is one of the sublimest that\r\ncould engage the attention of the human mind--the great events in the\r\nlife of the Saviour--and it struck down into the depths of his deeply\r\nreligious nature. Volumes of sermons and criticisms have been preached\r\nand written upon the ‘Messiah’ from every conceivable religious and\r\nartistic angle. In England it has taken a place of devout veneration\r\nthat is almost a fetich. Yet Ernest Walker, the English critic,\r\ndeclares that ‘if it was necessary for us blindly to bow the knee for\r\nall time to one single work, no doubt the \"Messiah\" was our wisest\r\nchoice.’\r\n\r\nThis monumental work was begun on the 22nd of August, 1741, and\r\nfinished on September 14th, therefore in the short space of\r\ntwenty-three days. It was performed first in Dublin on April 13th,\r\n1742, and it won immediate success. In London it was given for the\r\nfirst time on March 23rd, 1743, and at this performance King George\r\nthe Second was so stirred during the singing of the words, ‘For the\r\nLord God Omnipotent reigneth,’ that he rose to his feet and the whole\r\naudience followed his reverent example. From this incident sprang the\r\nfamiliar custom of rising during the singing of the Hallelujah Chorus.\r\nThe work was given thirty-four times during Handel’s lifetime and he\r\nhimself directed it for the last time on April 6th, 1759, only a week\r\nbefore his death. The first really adequate performance of it was given\r\nin Westminster Abbey in 1784, when it was given by the largest mass of\r\nperformers ever assembled up to that time, the orchestra numbering 242\r\nand the chorus 267. This was, however, eclipsed by the performance in\r\nthe Crystal Palace at the centenary of the composer’s death, when an\r\norchestra of 460 and a choir of 2,700 performed the work.\r\n\r\nIt is in three parts, the first containing the prophecy of the coming\r\nof the Messiah and the narrative of the nativity. It opens after\r\na noble orchestral introduction with a tenor recitative and aria,\r\n‘Comfort ye my people’ and ‘Every valley shall be exalted.’ This, like\r\nmany of the Handel arias, is very ornate and requires a flexible vocal\r\ntechnique, single syllables being used for long florid passages. A\r\nsimilar illustration of this is found in the bass recitative, ‘Thus\r\nsaith the Lord,’ and in the middle part of the following pastoral aria,\r\n‘But who may abide,’ where the demands upon a fluent vocal delivery are\r\nexceedingly great, especially for the naturally slow-moving bass voice.\r\nThese vocal demands, however, are not confined to the solos, but appear\r\nwith equal force in some of the choruses as well, a good illustration\r\nof which is the brilliant fugal chorus, ‘And he shall purify.’ This\r\nis followed by the favorite contralto solo, ‘O Thou that tellest good\r\ntidings to Zion,’ which is taken up at its close and developed by the\r\nchorus. One of the most magnificent choruses in the first part is ‘For\r\nunto us a child is born’ and this is followed by the exquisite pastoral\r\nsymphony which precedes the narration of the shepherds. The contralto\r\nand soprano arias, ‘He shall feed his flock’ and ‘Come unto Him all ye\r\nthat labor,’ are among the most beautiful lyric melodies of oratorio\r\nliterature and these are followed by the fugal chorus which closes the\r\nfirst part, ‘His yoke is easy.’\r\n\r\nThe second part, depicting the Saviour’s suffering, death and triumph,\r\nbegins with a noble chorus, ‘Behold the Lamb of God,’ after which\r\nthe alto sings one of the most expressively beautiful arias ever\r\nwritten, ‘He was despised.’ When Mrs. Cibber sang this aria at the\r\nfirst performance in Dublin, the Reverend Mr. Delany, friend of Dean\r\nSwift, who cherished a prejudice against all public singers, was so\r\ntransported by the pathos of the music that he rapturously exclaimed:\r\n‘Woman, for this be all thy sins forgiven.’ It is followed by the\r\ndramatically expressive choruses, ‘Surely He hath borne our griefs,’\r\n‘And with His stripes’ and ‘All we, like sheep, have gone astray,’ the\r\nlast closing with a stately chorale, ‘And the Lord hath laid on Him the\r\niniquity of us all.’ One of the most effective choruses in this part is\r\nthe joyous ‘Lift up your heads, O ye gates,’ but the real climax of the\r\npart, and indeed of the whole work, is the ‘Hallelujah’ chorus, of such\r\nwondrous power and sustained beauty that everything after it must of\r\nnecessity take on something of the nature of an anticlimax.\r\n\r\nThe short third part forms, as it were, a Credo, as expressed by the\r\ngreat soprano aria, ‘I know that my Redeemer liveth.’ The work closes\r\nwith two of Handel’s finest choruses--‘Worthy is the Lamb,’ of great\r\ndignity and nobility, and the triumphant ‘Amen’ fugue, overpowering in\r\nits majestic sweep of contrapuntal movement. Speaking of the impression\r\nthat this deeply religious epic has always produced on audiences in\r\nevery country, Mr. F. J. Crowest, in ‘The Great Tone Poets,’ exclaims:\r\n‘Where is the prelate who can move our souls as they are moved by\r\nHandel’s \"Messiah\"?’ And what can be added to such praise?\r\n\r\n\r\n                                   VII\r\n\r\n‘Israel in Egypt.’--This work, the most perfect example of the\r\nchoral oratorio, containing some of the most colossal choruses ever\r\nwritten (twenty-eight double choruses), was composed in October, 1738,\r\nin the short interval of twenty-seven days. In addition to the choruses\r\nthere are only five arias, three duets and some short recitatives,\r\nwhich serve as connecting links in the massive choral chain. The second\r\npart (the Exodus) was written first and had evidently been planned\r\nas a cantata; however, Handel doubtless realized the possibilities\r\nof the vast material at hand and added the first part, which thus\r\nbecame an historical introduction to the work already written. Its\r\nfirst performance took place on April 4th, 1739, at the King’s\r\nTheatre, London, and on the 11th it was given again but with some\r\nalterations, caused by insertion of songs, and at the third performance\r\non April 17th, the ‘Funeral Anthem’ in memory of Queen Caroline was\r\ninterpolated. For some reason this excellent work was not successful\r\nand was given only nine times during Handel’s lifetime. It was again\r\nbrought to light in 1849 by the Sacred Harmonic Society of London,\r\nwhen it was peformed as originally written, and in this form it is now\r\ngiven. The text, credited to Handel, was really taken literally from\r\nthe Bible and arranged by him so as to form a very dramatic narrative.\r\n\r\n\r\n           [Illustration: Facsimile of Handel’s Manuscript:\r\n                    the Last Page of ‘The Messiah’]\r\n\r\n\r\nIt opens, without an overture, with a few measures of tenor recitative\r\n(‘Now there arose a King in Egypt who knew not Joseph’), leading at\r\nonce to the lament of the Israelites over the cruelties of the Egyptian\r\nbondage (‘And the children of Israel sighed’), a double chorus of\r\ngreat dramatic power leading up to the words, ‘And their cry came up\r\nunto God.’ After another short recitative for tenor, there follows the\r\nseries of choruses descriptive of the plagues, in which the composer\r\nuses almost modern descriptive means. Thus, the first of the choruses\r\ndescribing the plague of the water turning to blood (‘They loathed\r\nto drink of the river’), is fugal and depicts the nauseating effects\r\nof the water upon the Egyptians; the hopping of the frogs is naïvely\r\nimitated in the accompaniment of the following aria for mezzo-soprano\r\n(‘Their land brought forth frogs’); and the plague of insects, a double\r\nchorus with a buzzing, restless orchestral accompaniment, is remarkably\r\ndescriptive of insect motion. Before the dramatic double chorus,\r\n‘He gave them hailstones for rain,’ the orchestra introduces the\r\napproaching storm, which, beginning gradually, develops into tremendous\r\nforce as if the elements had been let loose. After the storm, comes\r\nthe gloom of the darkness that fell over the land and vague, uncertain\r\ntones grope about as the chorus sings, ‘He sent a thick darkness over\r\nall the land.’ Then, in the savage fury of righteous retribution, a\r\nchorus of unexampled energy (‘He smote all the first-born of Egypt’)\r\ndescribes the swift vengeance of the Most High. The English critic\r\nChorley calls it ‘a fiercely Jewish’ chorus, with ‘a touch of Judith,\r\nof Jael, of Deborah in it--no quarter, no delay, no mercy for the\r\nenemies of the Most High.’ The passage of the Red Sea follows these\r\nstormy descriptive choruses, and another dramatic but jubilant chorus\r\n(‘But the waters overwhelmed their enemies’) is succeeded by two short\r\nchoruses of a devotional character which bring the first part to a\r\nclose.\r\n\r\nThe second part, ‘The Song of Moses,’ after a short orchestral\r\nintroduction, is ushered in by a chorus (‘Moses and the children of\r\nIsrael sang this song’), after which comes the sublime fugal chorus, a\r\nmighty song of praise to the Lord (‘For He hath triumphed gloriously’).\r\nIn this part is also the famous declamatory duet for two basses, ‘The\r\nLord is a Man of War,’ and the great tenor aria, ‘The enemy said \"I\r\nwill pursue.\"’ After the exultant song of Miriam, the prophetess, there\r\ncomes a magnificent triumphal double chorus, splendidly supported\r\nby the orchestra--a piling up of voice upon voice, instrument upon\r\ninstrument, in a pæan of exultation and triumph, which brings the work\r\nto a climactic close of tremendous dramatic effectiveness.\r\n\r\n‘Judas Maccabæus.’--This oratorio was written at the request of the\r\nPrince of Wales for the celebration of the victory of Culloden (April\r\n16th, 1746) and the work, written in thirty-two days (July 9th to\r\nAugust 11th, 1746), was performed on April first, 1747, the festal\r\nday celebrating the return of the victorious Duke of Cumberland. The\r\ntext was prepared by the Reverend Thomas Morell, D.D., who selected\r\nthe material concerning the events surrounding the Hebrew warrior from\r\nthe First Book of Maccabees and from Josephus. The first performance\r\nat Covent Garden was so successful that the work was repeated six\r\ntimes that year. Handel himself conducted it thirty-eight times, and\r\nit gained steadily in popularity, which was further augmented by the\r\nenthusiasm of the Jews, who delighted in it because it extolled a proud\r\nevent in their national history.\r\n\r\nThe first part (the time is the second century B. C.) opens with the\r\nlament of the Israelitish men and women over the death of their leader\r\nMattathias (father of Judas Maccabæus and his brother Simon), who had\r\ninspired the Jews to withstand the tyranny of Antiochus Epiphanes, king\r\nof Syria, in his effort to deprive them of their freedom and their\r\nreligious worship. The first chorus, ‘Mourn, ye afflicted children,’\r\nand, after a duet, the chorus ‘For Zion lamentation make,’ establish at\r\nonce the sombre mood of the whole work. Simon’s militant, ringing aria,\r\n‘Arm, arm, ye brave,’ which is still an effective solo greatly beloved\r\nof bass singers, is followed by a short but rousing chorus, ‘We come in\r\nbright array.’ The first part closes with one of the most massive and\r\nimposing choruses from Handel’s pen, ‘Hear us, O Lord.’\r\n\r\nThe second part opens with an instrumental prelude descriptive of the\r\nbattle scenes and the celebration of the initial victories, and leads\r\ninto the finest chorus in the work, a powerful song of triumph, ‘Fallen\r\nis the foe.’ The war of liberation is renewed, Judas rouses the courage\r\nof his depressed people and his army departs to meet the enemy, while\r\nthose who remain behind voice their denunciation of the idolatries\r\nof the heathen. The second part closes dramatically with the chorus,\r\n‘We never will bow down to the rude stock or sculptured stone,’ which\r\ndevelops into a vigorous chorale in which is heard the repeated phrase,\r\n‘We worship God alone.’\r\n\r\nThe third part begins with a prayer, ‘Father of heaven, from Thy\r\neternal throne,’ which is sung by the priest in the recovered and\r\nrestored temple of Jerusalem. A messenger announces the victory of\r\nJudas and, as the youths and maidens go out to meet the returning\r\nvictor, they sing the world-famous jubilant chorus, ‘See the conquering\r\nhero comes,’ which, by the way, was originally composed for ‘Joshua’\r\nas a tribute to Othniel on his return from the capture of Debir, and\r\nwas later transferred to ‘Judas Maccabæus.’ The oratorio appropriately\r\ncloses with a Hallelujah chorus which at once celebrates the return of\r\npeace and serves as the joyous expression of national thanksgiving.\r\n\r\n‘Samson.’--Although this work was written almost at the same time as\r\nthe ‘Messiah’ (1741), it was not performed until February 18th, 1743,\r\nwhen it was given in London at Covent Garden. Its success was instant.\r\nEight consecutive performances were given--a far more eloquent tribute\r\nin Handel’s time than in our own to the popular appreciation with which\r\nit was received. Handel himself regarded the work with deep affection,\r\nand, when urged to express a preference for either the ‘Messiah’ or\r\n‘Samson,’ declared he was unable to choose between them. During his\r\nlifetime ‘Samson’ shared almost equal popularity with the ‘Messiah’\r\nand ‘Judas Maccabæus’--the three most frequently performed. The text,\r\narranged by Newburg Hamilton from Milton’s poem, ‘Samson Agonistes,’\r\nalthough based upon the Bible narrative of the powerful Samson, does\r\nnot follow it absolutely. The principal characters are Samson; Micah,\r\nhis friend; Manoah, his father; Delilah, his wife; and Harapha, a giant\r\nof Gath. The scene is laid before the prison of Gaza.\r\n\r\nA brilliant overture, stately at first and gradually developing into\r\nminuet rhythm, opens the work, which at once reveals the blind captive,\r\nSamson, temporarily released from his menial toil because of the\r\nfeast of Dagon, and lamenting his deplorable plight as he hears the\r\nfiery chorus of the priests, ‘Awake the trumpet’s lofty sound.’ His\r\nfather and his friend come to lament with him just after his touching\r\ntenor song (‘Torments, alas!’), and as they ask which of his sorrows\r\nis greater, blindness or captivity, Samson sings one of the noblest\r\nlaments ever written, ‘Total eclipse: no sun, no moon, all dark amidst\r\nthe blaze of noon,’ a song which touched Handel so deeply in his latter\r\ndays of blindness that he wept at the performance, as did the audience\r\nwith him. Samson nobly tells his friends that his punishment is\r\ndeserved and that there is no hope for him; but at times he furiously\r\ndenounces his foes, especially in the dramatic outburst, ‘Why does the\r\nGod of Israel sleep?’ which is followed by an elaborate choral fugue\r\n(‘Then shall they know’) on two subjects, one given by the altos, the\r\nother by the tenors. The first part closes with a beautiful chorus in\r\nwhich his friends point his thought to the joys of a future life for\r\ncompensation for all his earthly sorrows.\r\n\r\nThe second part discloses Delilah trying again to entice her husband,\r\nbut he now understands her treachery and answers her sensuous song\r\nwith the emphatic ‘Your charms to ruin led the way.’ He then has\r\na visitation from the giant Harapha who taunts him on his present\r\ncondition. The colloquy between the giants produces two of the finest\r\narias of the oratorio--Harapha’s dashing and boastful bass aria, ‘Honor\r\nand arms scorn such a foe,’ and Samson’s proud answer, ‘My strength is\r\nfrom the living God.’ Micah finally bids Harapha to call on Dagon to\r\n‘dissolve the magic spells that gave our hero strength,’ after which\r\nis heard the broad, devout six-part chorus of the Israelites, ‘Hear,\r\nJacob’s God.’ The part closes with a massive double chorus--in which\r\nIsraelites and Philistines, in choral strife, extol their respective\r\ndeities.\r\n\r\nIn the third part, Harapha notifies Samson that he must appear at the\r\nfeast of Dagon to exhibit his strength and, though he refuses at first,\r\nhe finally yields because he believes it to be God’s will. Samson calls\r\nupon the Spirit which led him formerly and goes to the temple. He\r\ntakes in each hand one of the pillars which support the roof and with\r\na mighty effort pulls down the temple, crushing the Philistines and\r\nburying himself with them. A tender, expressive funeral march is played\r\nas Samson is borne away by his people. For this march Handel afterwards\r\nsubstituted the Dead March from ‘Saul’ and both marches now appear in\r\nthe score. Manoah exhorts the people to lay aside their sorrow and\r\npraise God, and this brings the famous trumpet aria, ‘Let the bright\r\nSeraphim,’ which is so grateful for both voice and instrument. The\r\nbrilliant chorus, ‘Let their celestial concerts,’ brings this imposing\r\noratorio to a triumphant close.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                   VIII\r\n\r\nMost of the great composers have frankly built on the achievements of\r\ntheir predecessors, carrying to completion or at least to higher stages\r\nof development the forms handed down to them, without much conscious\r\ninfluence from contemporary composers. Some, like Wagner and Schubert,\r\nhave struck out new lines whose discovery and development cannot be\r\nexplained wholly as resulting from the operation of preceding artistic\r\nforces and principles. Comparatively few of the really great composers\r\nhave acknowledged their indebtedness to contemporary genius. Such a\r\none, however, was ‘Papa’ Haydn. The youthful Mozart had opened up new\r\nvisions in symphonic and orchestral music and compelled the veteran\r\nHaydn[79] to new effort. And when Haydn heard the ‘Messiah’ for the\r\nfirst time in Westminster Abbey during his first visit to England\r\nin 1791, he was so moved by the majesty of the ‘Hallelujah’ chorus\r\nthat it inspired him to the composition of what is undoubtedly his\r\ngreatest work, the ‘Creation.’ This work joins with its great artistic\r\ninspirer, Handel’s ‘Messiah,’ and with Mendelssohn’s ‘Elijah’ in\r\nforming a trio of the world’s most popular oratorios. Of his other two\r\noratorios--the ‘Seasons’ and ‘The Return of Tobias’--only the former\r\nclaims present-day performance and that far less frequently than its\r\npredecessor, the ‘Creation.’ One misses in Haydn’s choral works the\r\nmassive grandeur of effect and complexity of structure of the Handel\r\noratorios. Haydn was a deeply religious man, but it was not in accord\r\nwith his happy, sunny, optimistic nature to sound the depths of human\r\nemotion. The great charm of the ‘Creation’ lies in the freshness, the\r\nartless simplicity, and the evident spontaneity of its melody, and the\r\nnaturalness and direct expressive power of its choruses.\r\n\r\nThe ‘Creation’ was begun in 1795, to a libretto given the composer\r\nby the London manager, Salomon, and compiled by Lidley from Milton’s\r\n‘Paradise Lost’ and from Genesis. It was completed in 1798, when Haydn\r\nwas sixty-six years old, and the first performance took place at the\r\nSchwarzenberg Palace on the 29th and 30th of April, 1798, with the\r\ntext translated and much altered by Baron von Swieten. It was first\r\npublicly produced at the National Theatre, Vienna, March 19, 1799, and\r\nwas received with greatest enthusiasm. It soon made its way to the\r\nmusic-centres of Europe, having its first London performance on March\r\n28th, 1800, and its first Paris performance on Dec. 24th, of the same\r\nyear. Napoleon I was on his way to attend the latter performance when\r\nhe narrowly escaped death by an infernal machine in the Rue Nicaise.\r\nStructurally one is impressed with the large number of arias and the\r\ncorrespondingly small number of choruses, as compared with Handel’s\r\nlater oratorios. In this respect Haydn was undoubtedly influenced by\r\nthe form of the Italian concert oratorio, then very popular in Vienna.\r\n\r\nIt is constructed in the usual three parts, the first two of which\r\nare the strongest. The overture is a quaint bit of tone painting; at\r\nfirst monotonous and barren of melody, it attempts to depict chaos;\r\nbut gradually form begins to appear in the music and the various\r\ninstruments speak out more clearly, until harmony is established. The\r\nfirst voice is that of Raphael (bass) in a short recitative, ‘In the\r\nbeginning,’ followed by a chorus which gently whispers the words, ‘And\r\nthe Spirit of God moved upon the face of the waters,’ closing with a\r\njoyous outburst on the words, ‘And there was light.’ The separation\r\nof light from darkness follows, Satan and his legions ‘sink into the\r\ndeep abyss’ and the quiet chorus appears, ‘A new created world springs\r\nup.’ The first four days of creation are described in a series of\r\nrecitatives, arias and choruses, many of which are familiar the world\r\nover--the inspiring chorus with soprano obbligato, ‘The marvellous\r\nwork’; the fine bass aria, ‘Rolling in foaming billows,’ with its\r\nlovely limpid refrain, ‘Softly purling’; and the well-known ‘With\r\nverdure clad,’ a soprano aria on which Haydn lavished the utmost care,\r\nhaving altered it three times before it entirely satisfied him--all\r\nleading up to the magnificent final chorus of the first part, ‘The\r\nheavens are telling,’ in which a trio of voices (Gabriel, Uriel and\r\nRaphael) is finely contrasted with the majestic choral passages.\r\n\r\nThe second part describes the creation of animate life on the earth.\r\nBeginning with birds, it enumerates the various classes, rising in\r\nthe scale until the crowning glory of creation is reached in man. The\r\nopening aria, ‘On mighty pens’ (Gabriel), pictures the eagle, the\r\nlark, the dove and the nightingale, each bird being depicted in a\r\ncharacteristic musical phrase in the accompaniment. One of the most\r\ninteresting numbers is the description of the roaring lions, with\r\ndeep growls of the double bassoons, the ‘flexible tiger’ with rapid\r\nstring passages, the alertness of the stag with a _presto_ movement,\r\nthe neighing and prancing of the horse, the fluttering and buzzing\r\nof swarming insects in the air--in all of which the humor of Haydn\r\nis naïvely expressed in comical musical mimicry. The creation of man\r\nbrings the beautiful tenor aria, ‘In native worth’ (Uriel). The final\r\nchorus is the superb fugue, ‘Achieved is the glorious work,’ in the\r\nmidst of which is set a trio, ‘On Thee each living soul awaits,’ and,\r\nafter a return to the fugue, closing with a Gloria and Hallelujah\r\nof singularly beautiful and majestic outlines. The third part opens\r\nwith an orchestral introduction picturing the first morning of the\r\ncompleted creation, in which the flutes and horns contribute some\r\nbeautiful effects. A tender dialogue between Adam and Eve is followed\r\nby a charming duet, ‘Graceful consort.’ The closing chorus, ‘Sing the\r\nLord, ye voices all,’ opens in a strain of solemn majesty and gradually\r\nunfolds until it leads into a massive fugue, ‘Jehovah’s praise forever\r\nshall endure.’ It closes with a mighty pæan of praise, given by the\r\ncombined chorus, solo voices and orchestra with telling effect.\r\n\r\n‘The Seasons.’--Haydn’s last oratorio, ‘The Seasons,’ the words for\r\nwhich were based on Thomson’s poem of the same name and arranged by\r\nBaron von Swieten, was written between April, 1798, and April, 1801,\r\nand first presented at the Schwarzenberg Palace, Vienna, on April 24th,\r\n1801. Three performances were given in close succession. This work can\r\nscarcely be called a real oratorio; it partakes more of the character\r\nand form of the sacred cantata, but is more frequently given the first\r\nnamed classification. The ‘Seasons’ represents a distinct decline in\r\nthe composer’s powers, but it is not to be wondered at, for he was\r\nsixty-nine years old when it was completed, and during its composition\r\nwas greatly harassed and irritated by the nonsensical demands and\r\ncaprices of the librettist. The characters are Simon, a farmer; Jane,\r\nhis daughter; and Lucas, a young countryman. These personages do not\r\nhave any dramatic significance, though the work contains a love scene\r\nbetween Lucas and Jane. That the scene is laid in the country is easily\r\nimagined from the subject, and the chorus represents the country-folk.\r\n\r\nThe first scene depicts early spring and opens with a lively overture\r\nand with recitatives from the three principals, expressing joy at the\r\napproach of the balmy season, at once followed by the first chorus,\r\n‘Come, gentle spring.’ After the farmer’s aria comes a trio and a fugal\r\nchorus, ‘Be propitious, bounteous heaven.’ The chorus, ‘Spring, her\r\nlovely charms unfolding,’ is almost redolent with the odor of waxen\r\nbuds and early blossoms. Following this is the closing fugal chorus,\r\n‘God of light.’\r\n\r\n‘Summer’ is introduced with a short prelude leading to a beautiful\r\naria by Simon, ‘From out the fold the shepherd drives,’ and at the\r\nappearance of the early sunrise the trio and chorus chant a song of\r\nwelcome, ‘Hail, O glorious sun!’ The various numbers picture the\r\nprogress of the day, and after the overwhelming heat of noon, an\r\nominous silence tells of the coming storm. The drums give forth a peal\r\nof thunder, followed by a storm-chorus, ‘Hark the deep, tremendous\r\nvoice.’ The driving rain, the thunder and the lightning-flashes are\r\nvividly pictured in the music. With the trio and chorus, ‘Now cease the\r\nconflicts,’ the music becomes tranquil again as the night approaches,\r\nwith the droning of insects, the croaking of the frogs, the song of the\r\nquail and the peals from a distant bell-tower--and darkness and slumber\r\ndrop over the land.\r\n\r\nThe third part, ‘Autumn,’ depicting the ‘kind rewards’ of Nature,\r\ncontains the song of Simon, ‘Behold, along the dewy grass,’ which is\r\nfollowed by the famous hunting chorus, ‘Hark! the mountains resound,’\r\na vivid tonal picture of the chase. A recitative, praising the rich\r\nvintage, leads to a scene of revelry, closing with the lively rustic\r\nchorus, ‘Joyful the liquor flows,’ in which a rollicking drinking-song,\r\na well-known Austrian dance-melody with suggestions of bagpipe and\r\nfiddle, is happily introduced.\r\n\r\n‘Winter’ is prefaced by a slow prelude indicative of the fogs creeping\r\nin. After the recitative of Simon and Jane’s cavatina, both picturing\r\nthe approach of the icy season, there is a realistic musical picture of\r\nthe wayfarer lost in the snow-storm. Simon moralizes on the changing\r\nseasons and offers as his conclusion that ‘nought but truth remains.’\r\nA prayer to Heaven for divine guidance brings the pastoral scene to a\r\nclose.\r\n\r\nThe eighteenth century came to an end with Handel as the great\r\noutstanding figure in oratorio and Haydn just appearing on the scene.\r\nEngland led Europe in its devotion to this form of choral art, though\r\nGermany was soon to awaken to its importance. Bach’s magnificent choral\r\nworks were slumbering on dusty shelves and Italian oratorio was still\r\nfatuously allied with operatic ideals, while France gave little heed to\r\nthe form at all. But another half-century was to witness a more even\r\ndistribution of interest in large choral forms.\r\n\r\n\r\n                              FOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[72] Score in the Royal Library, Dresden.\r\n\r\n[73] Fétis proves in his _Biographie universelle_ how materially\r\nScarlatti influenced a more extended branching out of violin technique.\r\n\r\n[74] The first ecclesiastic who is known to have used a dramatic\r\npresentation of the Passion is St. Gregory Nazianzen (330-390).\r\n\r\n[75] Winterfeld, in _Der Evangelische Kirchengesang_, states that the\r\nearliest known Passion-music composed by a Protestant was published in\r\nKeuchenthal’s book (Wittenberg, 1573), which contained a German version\r\nof the Passion with four-part music for the recitation and choruses.\r\n\r\n[76] Though no accompaniment at all is indicated in the score of any\r\nof these Passion-oratorios, it is very probable that organ was used to\r\naccompany some parts.\r\n\r\n[77] Édouard Devrient, Mendelssohn’s friend and helper in the Bach\r\nrevival.\r\n\r\n[78] Arthur Mees, ‘Choirs and Choral Music,’ p. 103.\r\n\r\n[79] Haydn (1732-1809) was Mozart’s senior by 24 years and was,\r\ntherefore, fifty-six years old when the thirty-two-year-old Mozart\r\nwrote his greatest symphonies--the ‘Jupiter,’ the ‘Apollo’ and the one\r\nin E-flat major.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                               CHAPTER VIII\r\n\r\n                 THE ORATORIO FROM BEETHOVEN TO BRAHMS\r\n\r\n     Beethoven: ‘The Mount of Olives’; Spohr: ‘The Last Judgment’\r\n     and ‘Calvary’--Mendelssohn: ‘St. Paul’--‘Elijah’ and ‘Hymn of\r\n     Praise’--Liszt: ‘St. Elizabeth’ and ‘Christus’--Oratorio in\r\n     England; Sterndale Bennett: ‘The Woman of Samaria’; Costa’s\r\n     ‘Eli’--Oratorio in France; Lesueur; Berlioz’s _L’enfance du\r\n     Christ_--Gounod: ‘The Redemption’; _Mors et Vita_.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                   I\r\n\r\nWith the early years of the nineteenth century came many forces which\r\nfed the awakening desire for choral song. The dawning consciousness of\r\nnational life in the Teutonic nations and the grateful sense of relief\r\nfrom Napoleonic oppression, with the accompanying train of intellectual\r\nactivities which the new sense of freedom let loose--all contributed\r\nto develop, in Germany particularly, a new attitude toward choral song\r\nas an outlet for the expression of the newly-awakened sense of new\r\nrelationships. Hence in Germany we will find the most important centre\r\nof choral activities in the first half of this century. Here many\r\nof that remarkable group of German composers who assumed undisputed\r\nleadership of the musical world during this period, gave to the\r\noratorio their richest thoughts and maturest attention--among them\r\nBeethoven, Spohr, Mendelssohn and Liszt.\r\n\r\n‘Christ on the Mount of Olives’ (_Christus am Oelberge_) was\r\nBeethoven’s only oratorio. It was begun in 1800 at a period when he was\r\nstill under the influence of Haydn and Mozart. It was finished in 1801\r\nand first performed at Vienna, April 5th, 1803. Its first production in\r\nEngland was in 1814 under Sir George Smart during the Lenten oratorios\r\nat Drury Lane. Huber’s text, which was written in fourteen days,\r\nhas been universally condemned as lacking in solemnity and failing\r\nin the essential dramatic requirements. Several attempts have been\r\nmade to substitute texts for the original one that would remove its\r\nincongruities, but without satisfactory results.\r\n\r\nThe work calls for three solo voices, Jesus, Peter, and the Seraph.\r\nThe introduction is an orchestral _adagio_ movement, very dramatic\r\nin character, depicting the agony in the Garden. This is followed\r\nby a recitative and aria for Jesus (tenor), ‘All my soul within me\r\nshudders,’ a sweet, pathetic number, in spite of its incongruity.\r\nThere ensues a scene and aria by the Seraph, ‘Praise the Redeemer’s\r\ngoodness,’ and joined to it a buoyant, joyous _obbligato_ with chorus,\r\n‘O triumph, all ye ransomed!’ This is followed by a duet between Jesus\r\nand the Seraph, ‘On Me then fall thy heavy judgment,’ which, like\r\nJesus’ first aria, offends through verging on the dramatic. After a\r\nshort recitative in which Jesus welcomes death, there follows a strong\r\nand properly dramatic number, a chorus of soldiers in march-time, ‘We\r\nsurely here shall find Him,’ in which are heard the shouts of the\r\nrabble and the grief of the apostles. Next comes a dialogue between\r\nJesus and Peter, ‘Not unchastised shall this audacious band,’ and\r\nfollowing this, a passage which again strains one’s sense of propriety,\r\ncomes a trio between Jesus, Peter and the Seraph, with chorus, ‘O\r\nsons of men, with gladness.’ The last number, a chorus of angels,\r\n‘Hallelujah, God’s Almighty Son,’ begins with a short but powerful\r\norchestral introduction which is followed by a joyous outburst; and\r\nthis in turn merges into a massive fugue, enriched and strengthened\r\nby a splendid orchestral accompaniment such as only Beethoven could\r\nconceive.\r\n\r\nHad Beethoven written another oratorio, as he evidently contemplated,\r\nhe doubtless would have enriched this form out of the tragic\r\nexperiences of his later life, as he so bountifully did the more\r\ncongenial forms of instrumental speech.\r\n\r\nSpohr (1784-1859) was a prolific composer in instrumental and vocal\r\nforms. His ‘Jessonda’ was regarded as one of the strongest early\r\nromantic operas and two of his three oratorios enjoyed a large measure\r\nof popularity during his lifetime and in subsequent years, particularly\r\nin England. His style was melodious, exceedingly chromatic and\r\nmodulatory, but his musical powers lacked the ability for sustained\r\nflights. While his musicianship charms, one feels a certain discrepancy\r\nbetween the grandeur of some of his oratorio themes and his musical\r\nmode of handling them. The Handelian breadth and massiveness is absent.\r\nHis three oratorios are ‘The Last Judgment,’ ‘Calvary’ and ‘The Fall of\r\nBabylon,’ the last named written for the Norwich (England) Festival of\r\n1842.\r\n\r\n‘The Last Judgment’ (_Die letzten Dinge_)--not to be confounded\r\nwith an earlier, crude oratorio, _Das jüngste Gericht_, written in\r\n1812--was composed in 1825 and first performed on Good Friday, 1826,\r\nat the Lutheran Church at Cassel. The first large performance was\r\nat the Rhenish Festival at Düsseldorf of the same year. Its first\r\nhearing in England was at the Norwich Festival, September 30th, 1830,\r\nand in America, at Boston, March 20th, 1843, when it was presented by\r\nthe Handel and Haydn Society. The English title of the oratorio is\r\nmisleading and was a mistranslation, confused with Spohr’s earlier\r\nwork, of similar name but different meaning. There is no suggestion\r\nof the terrors of the last judgment in this oratorio. The text of the\r\nfirst part is given over wholly to the general thought of praise ‘unto\r\nHim that sitteth upon the throne and unto the Lamb forever.’ The second\r\npart is concerned with those portions of Revelation that describe the\r\nsigns of the last day, closing with St. John’s vision of a new heaven\r\nand a new earth.\r\n\r\nThe first part contains among other numbers the well-known chorus, ‘All\r\nglory to the Lamb that died’; the admirable tenor solo and chorus,\r\n‘Blessing, honor, glory and power,’ with a tranquil beginning and\r\nending, but expanding into a well-written fugue in the middle; and the\r\nclosing number, a beautiful quartet and chorus, ‘Lord God of Heaven\r\nand Earth.’ The second part begins with an orchestral introduction\r\nwhich graphically portends the signs and wonders of the last day. These\r\nare dramatically related in the following long bass recitative with\r\nvigorous, agitated accompaniment. After the powerful chorus, ‘Destroyed\r\nis Babylon,’ the vision of a new heaven and earth is proclaimed by the\r\nsoprano, and three transitional numbers lead to the last movement,\r\na majestic chorus, ‘Great and wonderful are all Thy works,’ which\r\nconsists of a smooth introduction, a lively fugue, still another fugue\r\n(‘Thine is the kingdom’), followed by an exultant outburst of praise\r\nand the final Amen.\r\n\r\n‘Calvary’ was first performed at Cassel on Good Friday, 1835. Four\r\nyears later it was given in England at the Norwich Festival, the\r\ncomposer himself conducting. While it met with considerable criticism\r\nbecause of ecclesiastical prejudice against the introduction of the\r\npersonality of Jesus among the singing characters (Beethoven’s ‘Mount\r\nof Olives’ occasioned the same offense), the work was a signal success.\r\nThe text was by Rochlitz.\r\n\r\nThe work deals with scenes connected with the crucifixion and abounds\r\nin beautiful, expressive melody, both in the choruses (sung by the\r\nfriends of Jesus) and in the ariosos of Mary and the recitatives of\r\nJohn. The beautiful chorus, ‘Gentle night, O descend,’ following a\r\nvery grave and somewhat protracted overture, is an example of this\r\nexpressive melody. The work becomes more impressive toward the close;\r\nespecially so is the cry of Jesus, ‘My God, my God, O why hast Thou\r\nforsaken me?’ followed by the fervent prayer of the disciples, ‘In\r\nthis dread hour of death,’ and another beautiful number sung by the\r\ndisciples, ‘His earthly race is run,’ set for a quartet of solo voices\r\naccompanied by the chorus. A highly dramatic number is the chorus of\r\npriests and people, as they express their consuming fear aroused by the\r\nconvulsions of nature attendant upon the crucifixion. The final number\r\nis a beautiful, sustained chorus of the disciples, ‘Beloved Lord, Thine\r\neyes we close.’\r\n\r\n\r\n                                   II\r\n\r\nThe world waited fifty-six years after the first performance of\r\nHandel’s ‘Messiah’ (1742) before Haydn presented his ‘Creation,’ the\r\nfirst oratorio after Handel’s death that is comparable with his great\r\nmasterpiece. After a lapse of thirty-eight years another oratorio\r\nappeared--Mendelssohn’s ‘St. Paul’--which rose above the ‘Creation’\r\nand revealed its composer as one on whose shoulders the mantle of both\r\nHandel and Bach had descended with power. Versatile as Mendelssohn\r\nwas in many forms, vocal polyphony seemed most congenial of all, and\r\nhe will undoubtedly live longest in his great choral masterpieces,\r\n‘St. Paul’ and ‘Elijah,’ the latter of which reaches a point of\r\ngrandeur of conception and effective dramatic expression that remains\r\nas yet unsurpassed by any subsequent choral work. One of the most\r\nskillful contrapuntists since Bach, a perfect master of orchestration\r\nand possessed of exquisite sense of formal values, Mendelssohn was\r\nsplendidly equipped to take advantage of the tremendous strides that\r\nhad been made in the musical means of expression since the time of\r\nHandel and Haydn. He absorbed the devotional intensity of Bach’s choral\r\nmusic and reinstated the chorale as an integral element of German\r\noratorio; from Handel he borrowed massiveness of choral structure and\r\nbrilliance of vocal writing. Like Handel, his mode of musical speech\r\nwas direct and intimate and its appeal was couched in terms of even\r\nmore suave beauty. The immediate success of Mendelssohn’s oratorios was\r\nwithout doubt greatly aided by the favorable condition of the popular\r\nreligious thought, as well as by the great acceleration in the interest\r\nin choral singing that had resulted from the immense popularity of\r\nHaydn’s ‘Creation’ in Germany. The appeal of this oratorio (‘Creation’)\r\nwas doubly strong on account of its simplicity of conception and\r\nmusical expression, so that in all directions choral societies were\r\nformed for the express purpose of producing it. A wide demand for\r\nchoral works was created, but nothing of permanent value came in\r\nresponse until Mendelssohn’s ‘St. Paul.’ On the whole Mendelssohn’s\r\noratorio-arias suffer from a lack of forcefulness due to the remarkable\r\nease with which he invented sensuously charming melodies, so that\r\nmany of them lack depth; but in choral writing his extraordinary\r\narchitectonic skill led him firmly to a style which carries him close\r\nto the height where Handel dwelt.\r\n\r\n‘St. Paul’ was the first of Mendelssohn’s great oratorios.\r\nIt was written at the request of the Cecilia Society of\r\nFrankfort-on-the-Main--begun in Düsseldorf and completed at Leipzig,\r\nwhen the composer was in his twenty-sixth year. The text was written by\r\nthe composer with the assistance of his friends Fürst and Schubring,\r\nafter A. B. Marx had declined to write it on the ground that the\r\nintroduction of chorales would be unsuited to the period of the\r\nnarrative. The work is developed from three main themes--the martyrdom\r\nof St. Stephen, the conversion of St. Paul and the latter’s career\r\nafter this event. Lampadius calls the work ‘the glorification of\r\nChristianity with its humility, its joy in living and dying for the\r\nLord, in contrast to the blind self-righteousness of Judaism and the\r\nmore sensuous morality of the heathen schools. It is the contrast, or\r\nrather the struggle, of the last two with the first, and the victory\r\nof the light and love of the Gospel. This thought is made incarnate in\r\nthe persons of Stephen, Paul and Barnabas; and is concentrated in the\r\nreally central point of interest of the whole oratorio--the conversion\r\nof St. Paul.’\r\n\r\nThe first performance of this work took place on May 22, 1836, on the\r\noccasion of the Lower Rhine Festival at Düsseldorf, the Cecilia Society\r\nof Frankfort having been compelled to forego its production because\r\nof the illness of its conductor. On Oct. 3rd, 1836, the first English\r\nperformance was given at Liverpool. In the meantime, notwithstanding\r\nits success, Mendelssohn had revised the work and shortened it by\r\nomitting ten numbers. The enthusiasm with which ‘St. Paul’ was received\r\nwas unprecedented, in Germany alone one hundred and fifty performances\r\nbeing given within eighteen months of its first production at\r\nDüsseldorf.\r\n\r\nThe rather long and expressive overture is followed directly by the\r\nfirst chorus, ‘Lord! Thou alone art God!’ which is very massively\r\nscored and expresses great exultation. The mood of this chorus changes,\r\nas it approaches its middle section, to the more excited and restless\r\ntheme, ‘The heathen furiously rage’; but soon returns to the mood\r\nwith which it opens and passes on directly to the chorale, ‘To God on\r\nHigh.’ This nobly beautiful melody is the beloved old German chorale,\r\n‘_Allein Gott in der Höh’ sei Ehr_.’ The next part marks the martyrdom\r\nof Stephen. A powerful choral recitative for the basses accuses him of\r\nblasphemy and the multitude takes up the cry, ‘Now this man ceaseth\r\nnot to utter blasphemous words.’ Stephen replies to this in a very\r\nexpressive solo, ‘Men, Brethren and Fathers!’ but the people again give\r\nway to their anger in the strong chorus, ‘Take him away!’ The soprano\r\nsolo, ‘Jerusalem, thou that killest the prophets,’ is a most eloquent\r\nadmonition, but uttered in vain. The people in a tumult of frenzy\r\ndemand his death (‘Stone him to death’). The pathetic tenor recitative\r\ntells of the tragic deed. Then follows a beautiful chorale of complete\r\nresignation, ‘To Thee, O Lord, I yield my spirit.’ Following this\r\nchorale, comes the calm and comforting chorus, ‘Happy and blest are\r\nthey,’ with its fluent, expressive melodies. The fiery, threatening\r\naria for bass, ‘Consume them all,’ brings Saul upon the scene. ‘But\r\nthe Lord is mindful of His own’ follows and offers a complete contrast\r\nin its quiet and lovely melody for alto. Now occurs the most vital\r\npoint of interest in the oratorio, the conversion. A voice from heaven\r\n(effectively represented by a soprano choir) is heard in the words,\r\n‘Saul, Saul, why persecutest thou Me?’ An orchestral interlude leads\r\nwith gradually growing crescendo to the powerful chorus, ‘Rise up!\r\narise!’ This is succeeded by the chorale, ‘Sleepers, wake! a voice\r\nis calling,’ in which the effect is greatly enhanced by the trumpet\r\nfigure following each choral line. The general mood grows more profound\r\nand serious as Saul offers up a prayer, ‘O God, have mercy upon me.’\r\nForgiveness and mercy are offered by Ananias and Saul’s sight is\r\nrestored to him and he is baptized as Paul the apostle. The first part\r\ncomes to a conclusion with the strong, exultant chorus, ‘O great is the\r\ndepth of the riches of wisdom.’\r\n\r\nA noble and dignified fugue, ‘The nations are now the Lord’s,’ opens\r\nthe second part of the oratorio. There soon follows the chorus, ‘How\r\nlovely are the messengers that preach us the gospel of peace,’ one\r\nof the most beautifully melodious numbers in the whole work. It is\r\nsucceeded by the soprano aria, ‘I will sing of Thy great mercies.’\r\nBut the scorn and rage of the Jews are aroused by the cures which\r\nPaul works in the name of the very prophet whose disciples he once so\r\ncruelly persecuted. The angry chorus, ‘Is this he who in Jerusalem,’\r\nis followed by another chorale, ‘O Thou the true and only light,’ a\r\nfervent prayer of the Church for divine guidance. Paul and Barnabas\r\ndepart for Lystra. Paul heals the cripple at Lystra and the multitude\r\nis deeply stirred. At this point Mendelssohn brings the three types of\r\nreligion--Greek, Christian and Jewish--in fine contrast in the three\r\nchoruses--‘O be gracious, ye immortals,’ full of Pagan sensuousness,\r\n‘But our God abideth in heaven,’ with its calm assurance of Christian\r\nfaith, and ‘This is Jehovah’s temple,’ in which the uncompromising\r\nintolerance of the Jews is angrily voiced. Paul bids a sorrowful\r\nfarewell to his brethren (‘Be thou faithful unto death’) and the\r\ncongregation tenderly responds, ‘Far be it from thy path.’ Two of\r\nthe finest choruses of the work are the final numbers, ‘See what\r\nlove hath the Father’ and ‘Now only unto Him.’ Two of the ‘St. Paul’\r\nchoruses--the beautiful chorale ‘To Thee, O Lord, I yield my spirit’\r\nand the melodious ‘Happy and blest are they’--were chosen to be sung at\r\nMendelssohn’s obsequies.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                   III\r\n\r\n‘Elijah.’--Mendelssohn waited a full ten years after the performance\r\nof ‘St. Paul’ before he produced another oratorio on such broad lines\r\nand when ‘Elijah’ appeared in 1846, the world recognized that it\r\nwas an event that transcended in importance any similar event since\r\nHandel’s ‘Messiah.’ ‘Elijah’ is certainly Mendelssohn’s finest and most\r\nsustained flight and there are not wanting those critics who stoutly\r\nmaintain that it is unsurpassed in the whole literature of oratorio. In\r\nit the composer enters new paths. He gives full rein to the intensely\r\ndramatic side of the text and freely departs from the conventional form\r\nof oratorio--so much so that the work might safely be called a sacred\r\nopera. ‘Elijah’ was long in the composer’s mind and he worked on it\r\ncarefully and with profoundest affection and sympathy, for although\r\nhe had embraced Christianity, there was something about the heroic\r\ncharacter of the old Hebrew militant prophet that struck deep into\r\nthe fibres of his being. Work on it was begun as early as 1840, but\r\nhe did not earnestly begin the composition of the music (the text he\r\ncompiled largely himself) until 1845. It was first performed at the\r\nBirmingham Festival on August 26th, 1846, when Mendelssohn conducted it\r\nbefore an enormous audience which extended to the composer one of the\r\nmost thrilling ovations ever enjoyed by a musician. Though its success\r\nwas most extraordinary, Mendelssohn was not deterred from carefully\r\nrevising it. It is interesting to note that the universally popular\r\n‘angels’ trio’ (‘Lift thine eyes’) was originally written for only two\r\nvoices.\r\n\r\nThe most startling innovation of the whole oratorio is the short,\r\nimpressive bass recitative which precedes the overture--Elijah’s\r\ndramatic prophecy of the drought. Then follows the sombre, gloomy\r\noverture portraying the results of the curse as the drought settles\r\nover the land and dries up the waters. It leads without pause into the\r\nopening chorus, ‘Help, Lord,’ which voices the anguished appeal of the\r\ndrought--and famine-stricken people. This dramatic supplication leads\r\ninto a second chorus, ‘Lord, bow Thine ear to our prayer,’ with a duet\r\nfor two sopranos, supported by a unison chorus, the theme of which is\r\nbased on an old Hebrew chant and is intoned first by the male and then\r\nby the female voices. The succeeding tenor aria (Obadiah), ‘If with all\r\nyour hearts,’ is of great beauty. The people are not consoled and again\r\nburst forth into vehement complaint, ‘Yet doth the Lord see it not,’\r\nwhich changes toward the end into a lovely chorale, ‘For He the Lord\r\nour God.’ An angel’s voice then calls Elijah to the waters of Cherith.\r\nA beautiful double quartet follows, whose simple melody is worked up\r\nwith fine effect, ‘For He shall give His angels charge over thee,’\r\nElijah is now bidden by the angel to the widow’s house at Zarephath.\r\nThe raising of her son follows in a dramatic scene consisting of\r\nthe mother’s passionate cry, ‘What have I to do with thee,’ and the\r\nprophet’s ‘Give me thy son.’ The scene then closes with the chorus,\r\n‘Blessed are the men who fear Him,’ The next scene is one of the most\r\ndramatic portions of the work--the appearance of the prophet before\r\nAhab, his defiant challenge to the priests of Baal to the sacrifice\r\non Mount Carmel, and the thrilling trial by fire. This part includes\r\nthe truly Pagan choruses, ‘Baal, we cry to thee’ and ‘Hear our cry,\r\nO Baal’; Elijah’s taunt, ‘Call him louder’; the prophet’s dignified\r\nappeal, ‘Lord God of Abraham,’ followed by the simple chorale, ‘Cast\r\nthy burden on the Lord’; the summoning of fire from heaven upon the\r\naltars, and the picturesque and descriptive chorus, ‘The fire descends\r\nfrom heaven.’ The priests are doomed to destruction by Elijah in an\r\nexcited recitative. Following a choral response, Elijah sings the\r\nhighly dramatic and difficult aria, ‘Is not His word like a fire?’\r\nAnother aria, ‘Woe unto them,’ for alto voice, succeeds Elijah’s and\r\nthe rain scene begins. In answer to Obadiah’s appeal to help the\r\npeople, Elijah sings his expressive invocation for rain, ‘Look down\r\nfrom heaven,’ and after several choral responses, together with the\r\nexclamations of Elijah and the youth who is sent ‘to look toward the\r\nsea,’ the signs of rain appear. Then follows the most thrilling climax\r\nof the whole work. As the clouds grow black with rain and the storm\r\ngathers force, the people begin to voice their thanks, the orchestra\r\ndescribes the rushing waters, and finally the whole chorus joins in a\r\ntumultuous outburst of thanksgiving (‘Thanks be to God’) which brings\r\nthe first part to a magnificent close.\r\n\r\nAn effective soprano solo, ‘Hear ye, Israel,’ opens the second part.\r\nThis leads into the strong, majestic chorus, ‘Be not afraid,’ one of\r\nMendelssohn’s finest choral efforts, in which the regular musical\r\nforces are augmented by the organ. Elijah needs the encouragement of\r\nthis admonition, for he again confronts Ahab and condemns the worship\r\nof Baal. The queen, Jezebel, accuses him of working to destroy Israel\r\nand the people in wrath shout, ‘Let the guilty prophet perish.’ Obadiah\r\nbids him fly to the wilderness. The next scene reveals the persecuted\r\nprophet alone and discouraged. In a pathetic plaint, ‘It is enough,’\r\nhe resigns himself to death and, wearied with flight, he falls asleep\r\nunder the juniper tree ‘and the angels encamp round about him.’ This\r\nleads directly to what is undoubtedly the most exquisitely beautiful\r\nvocal trio in existence--the pure and serene ‘Lift thine eyes,’ sung\r\n_a cappella_ by the watching angels. Without pause there follows the\r\nbeautiful chorus, ‘He watching over Israel.’ The angel then awakens\r\nElijah, who complains pathetically, ‘O Lord, I have labored in vain.’\r\n‘O rest in the Lord,’ sung by the angel, offers Elijah consolation.\r\nThe encouraging chorus, ‘He shall endure to the end,’ brings the scene\r\nto a majestic close. The following scene reveals a changed Elijah. He\r\nyearns now for the divine presence instead of for death. In a sudden\r\noutburst the chorus exclaims, ‘Behold, God the Lord passed by.’ A\r\nsudden _pianissimo_ works up into an impressive _crescendo_, and once\r\nmore appears a _pianissimo_ as the chorus impressively exclaims, ‘The\r\nLord was not in the tempest.’ The earthquake and the tempest and the\r\nfire follow. ‘And there came a still, small voice ... and in that\r\nstill, small voice onward came the Lord.’ Elijah was transformed by\r\nthe experience and went on his way ‘in the strength of the Lord.’ His\r\nstrong, confident aria follows, ‘For the mountains shall depart.’ A\r\npowerful chorus states that ‘Then did Elijah the prophet break forth\r\nlike a fire’ and there follows the dramatic choral narrative of the\r\nprophet’s ascent into heaven in a fiery chariot. The fine tenor aria,\r\n‘Then, then shall the righteous shine,’ and the melodious quartet,\r\n‘Oh! come, every one that thirsteth,’ lead over into the final choral\r\nnumber--a magnificent fugue (‘Lord, our Creator’), introduced by the\r\nmajestic phrase, ‘And then shall your light break forth.’\r\n\r\n‘Hymn of Praise.’--This symphony-cantata was composed to commemorate\r\nthe fourth centennial of the invention of the art of printing, held at\r\nLeipzig, in June, 1840. A second performance followed at Birmingham,\r\nMendelssohn conducting, a few months later, Sept. 23rd. Dramatically\r\nit has no very great significance, being designed purely as a ‘tribute\r\nof praise’ for the manifold gifts of the Lord, among them being the\r\nart of printing--which the text, based upon the Scriptures, carefully\r\nelucidates.\r\n\r\nThe symphony, or instrumental prelude, is divided into three parts,\r\nopening with a majestic trombone passage which clearly anticipates\r\nthe mood of the ensuing cantata. The real ‘Hymn of Praise’ is given\r\nout in the opening chorus, ‘All that has life and breath,’ based upon\r\nthe motive heard in the opening measure of the prelude. The work then\r\nmoves on in a majestic manner, reaching its climax with the entrance\r\nof the impressive chorus, ‘The night is departing.’ A final chorus,\r\n‘Ye nations, offer to the Lord,’ is in fugal form and is inspiring in\r\nits massiveness. The choral motive, ‘All that has life and breath,’\r\nis again given out _fortissimo_ and brings the work to an impressive\r\nclose. The duet for two sopranos, ‘I waited for the Lord,’ is one of\r\nthe most beautiful numbers in this work.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                   IV\r\n\r\nThe dazzling achievements of Liszt (1811-86) as a pianoforte virtuoso\r\nand the popularity and originality of his instrumental compositions\r\nhave put his choral work in an unfortunate perspective; and they have\r\nby no means received the attention they richly merit. Two of the finest\r\nexamples of oratorio of this period are from the brilliant Abbé’s pen,\r\nboth written in the full maturity of his powers and with the employment\r\nof all his immense resources of dramatic and emotional expression.\r\nThey are ‘Christus’ and ‘The Legend of the Holy Elizabeth.’ The latter\r\nlegend, familiar to English readers through Canon Kingsley’s dramatic\r\npoem, ‘The Saint’s Tragedy,’ deals with the life of the daughter of\r\nKing Andreas II of Hungary, born in 1207, who at the age of four was\r\nsent to the Wartburg to be brought up as the affianced bride of Ludwig,\r\nson of the Landgrave Hermann of Thuringia. After their marriage in 1220\r\nwonderful tales were told of her devotion to the poor, of her pious\r\nChristian life, and, after Ludwig’s death, of the cruel hardships which\r\nthe hatred of her mother-in-law brought upon her. She died in 1231 and\r\nwas canonized at Marburg in 1235 by command of Pope Gregory IX.\r\n\r\n‘The Legend of Saint Elizabeth’ was composed in 1864 and received its\r\nfirst performance in Budapest on August 15, 1865, which event marked\r\nthe twenty-fifth anniversary of the establishment of the Budapest\r\nConservatory. The composition, however, was really undertaken at the\r\nrequest of the Duke of Weimar for a festival held at the Wartburg on\r\nAug. 28, 1867, commemorating both the eighth centenary of its founding\r\nand also the restoration of the romantic old castle which was so\r\nintimately associated with the legend of St. Elizabeth. The text by\r\nOtto Roquette was inspired by the six magnificent frescoes by Moritz\r\nvon Schwind which adorn the walls of the Wartburg, and it is divided\r\ninto six scenes corresponding to the six frescoes.\r\n\r\nThe first scene opens with an orchestral introduction which sets forth\r\nthe Elizabeth motive, taken from an old ecclesiastical melody. The\r\nmusic grows animated as it leads into the first chorus, which joyfully\r\nwelcomes the child Elizabeth, who as the affianced bride of Ludwig,\r\nson of the Landgrave of Thuringia, comes to the Wartburg, where she\r\nis brought up side by side with her future husband. The second scene\r\nreveals the happy matron Elizabeth, now for some years the wife of\r\nLudwig. One of the most beautiful parts of the whole work is the duet\r\nbetween Elizabeth and Ludwig as he surprises her in her alms-deeds\r\nwhich she tries to conceal from him because of her mother-in-law’s\r\nfierce disapproval of them. Especially dramatic and beautiful is the\r\nportion dealing with the ‘Rose Miracle.’ The quaint story of this\r\nepisode is as follows: Elizabeth, having dismissed her ladies in order\r\nthat she may secretly bring bread and wine to some of her poor, sick\r\nsubjects, suddenly meets her husband in the deep forest far from the\r\nWartburg. Ludwig’s suspicions are aroused and when he asks what her\r\nbasket contains, she tells him that she has been gathering roses.\r\nLudwig, who does not believe her, seizes the basket, when she hastily\r\nconfesses that it is bread and wine, and behold! the contents of the\r\nbasket have been turned into roses! Liszt was very desirous of having\r\nthis very mysterious and ethereal and indicated in the score that the\r\norchestra should in this part ‘sound fairly transfigured’ and that the\r\nconductor should ‘scarcely mark the rhythm’ in order not to imperil the\r\neffect. The penitent Ludwig begs her forgiveness and as she asks, ‘Is\r\nit a dream?’ the chorus responds, ‘A wonder hath the Lord performed.’\r\n\r\nScene three opens with the stately chorus of crusaders (‘In Palestine,\r\nthe Holy Land’) with dignified march accompaniment, which leads to\r\nLudwig’s farewell to his wife on his departure for the Holy Wars.\r\nThen ensues Elizabeth’s passionate entreaty, ‘Oh tarry! O shorten not\r\nthe hour,’ followed by the pathetic ‘With grief my spirit wrestles,’\r\nafter which the stirring chorus and march of the crusaders closes the\r\nscene. Scene four, with its short, sombre orchestral prelude, announces\r\nthe death of Ludwig, the bitter antagonism of Landgravine Sophie,\r\nElizabeth’s mother-in-law, who drives the sorrowing, broken-hearted\r\nyoung widow from her home. Especially dramatic are the dialogues,\r\nin the midst of which is Elizabeth’s aria, ‘O day of mourning, day\r\nof sorrow,’ in which she pours out her grief as she fares forth in\r\nthe storm. Scene five discloses Elizabeth on her death-bed in a\r\nhospital founded by herself, where she has forgotten her own sorrow in\r\nministering unto others. Her last words (‘Unto mine end Thy love has\r\nled me’), after a gradual _decrescendo_ in the orchestra, are followed\r\nby a chorus of angels, ‘All grief is o’er,’ closing with the celestial\r\nstrains of harps. An orchestral interlude, in which are developed the\r\nmain themes of the work, leads to the last scene, which depicts the\r\ncanonization of Elizabeth at Marburg in the presence of the Emperor.\r\nThis ceremony closes the work with a chorus of the people mourning her\r\ndeath, choruses of the crusaders, of the church choristers and bishops,\r\nand finally an imposing six-part chorus, the Latin hymn, _Tu pro nobis,\r\nmater pia_.\r\n\r\n_Christus_ was composed in 1866 during Liszt’s residence in Rome, just\r\nafter he had been appointed Abbé by his friend, Archbishop Hohenlohe,\r\nand at a time when, it is said, he entertained high hopes of being\r\nappointed chapel-master of the Papal Choir. But, though he was in high\r\nfavor with the Catholic hierarchy, nothing came of it. The _Christus_\r\nwas written soon after the ‘Legend of St. Elizabeth,’ but, while both\r\nare deeply imbued with the spirit of Roman Catholicism, the former\r\nreflects the deep interest which he took in religious matters at the\r\ntime far more than does the latter. Liszt compiled the text, which is\r\nin Latin, entirely from the Bible and from the Roman liturgy. There are\r\nthree divisions to the work--(1) ‘The Nativity,’ (2) ‘After Epiphany,’\r\ndealing with the Lord’s life and ministry, and (3) ‘The Passion and\r\nthe Resurrection.’ The first fragmentary performance of ‘Christus’\r\ntook place July 6, 1867, at the Sala Dantesca, in Rome, and another in\r\nVienna in 1871. The first complete production was at Weimar in 1873\r\nunder the direction of the composer.\r\n\r\nThe first part, containing five numbers, opens with an orchestral\r\nprelude built on an ancient plain-song melody, _Rorate cœli_, in\r\nIsaiah’s prophecy. This leads into a quaint Pastoral, after which\r\ncomes the angels’ announcement of Jesus’ birth and a _Gloria in\r\nexcelsis_. A devotional setting of the old Latin hymn, _Stabat mater\r\nspeciosa_, leads into two orchestral movements of great beauty--‘The\r\nSong of the Shepherds at the Manger,’ a lovely pastoral, and ‘The\r\nMarch of the Three Kings,’ an elaborate number in which the high tones\r\nof the violins and flutes typify the Star of Bethlehem. The second\r\npart contains ‘The Beatitudes’ for baritone and six-part chorus, the\r\nLord’s Prayer, a part entitled ‘The Founding of the Church’ (_Tu es\r\nPetrus_), ‘The Miracle’ (Jesus calming the storm), again treated\r\norchestrally, and ‘The Entry into Jerusalem,’ a brilliantly scored\r\ntone-picture, mainly instrumental, save for two vocal passages--a\r\nHosanna for chorus and a Benedictus for mezzo-soprano and chorus. The\r\nthird part opens with the pathetic solo _Tristis est anima mea_ (‘My\r\nsoul is sorrowful’), in which the Christ pours out his soul to Peter\r\nand his companions on the way to Gethsemane. The orchestra plays a most\r\nimportant part in the expression of this tragic struggle, after which\r\nthe ancient Latin hymn, _Stabat mater dolorosa_, is given with combined\r\norchestral and choral forces. Of all the settings of this celebrated\r\nliturgic text, Liszt’s is the most powerful and impressive, though it\r\nis too overwhelming in its effect for use in the church-service. This\r\nlengthy and elaborate number is contrasted strongly with the following\r\nsimple and quaint Easter hymn, _O filii et filiæ_, which prepares the\r\nlistener for the majestic _Resurrexit_ (‘Resurrection’) which follows\r\nand builds up a final climax, with the combined resources of chorus and\r\norchestra, that is really commensurate with the grandeur of the theme.\r\n\r\nLiszt himself regarded the _Christus_ as his best work--‘my musical\r\nwill and testament’--and in works of its class it certainly stands\r\nunique in the intensity of its expression and in the unusual\r\ncombination of mediæval church atmosphere and modern musical\r\nresources--a powerful fusing of the old and the new. It is scarcely\r\nan oratorio in the usual understanding of the term, but rather a kind\r\nof liturgic mystery, such as Lesueur strove to build up but did not\r\ncomplete. It cannot be considered apart from the religious faith of\r\nits composer and from this point of view it stands as the highest\r\nrepresentative of Roman Catholic oratorio.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                   V\r\n\r\nThe influence of England on oratorio is by no means to be measured\r\nby the number of original works of this class produced by Englishmen.\r\nNo other country in the world has such a record of long and unbroken\r\nloyalty to this musical form and no other country has so freely opened\r\nits doors to composers of other nationalities. When one recalls that\r\nHandel’s series of magnificent oratorios was written for English\r\nappreciation, that Haydn’s ‘Creation’ drew its inspiration from London,\r\nthat Mendelssohn’s ‘Elijah,’ Gounod’s ‘Redemption’ and _Mors et Vita_,\r\nand many other oratorios of less worth were written for, and received\r\ntheir initial performances before, English festival audiences, one can\r\nform some estimate of what English love of choral art has done for its\r\ndevelopment.\r\n\r\nEnglish composers of this period were still using the musical\r\nphraseology of Handel and Mendelssohn, so that not much can be said\r\nof the individual works produced, though several were worthy and held\r\na certain popularity for a long time. Among the more notable English\r\noratorios of the period were Sir Julius Benedict’s ‘St. Peter’ (1870),\r\nGeorge Alexander Macfarren’s ‘St. John the Baptist,’ which was received\r\nenthusiastically at the Bristol Festival of 1873, William Sterndale\r\nBennett’s ‘The Woman of Samaria,’ and Sir Michael Costa’s ‘Eli’ and\r\n‘Naaman’ (Birmingham Festival, 1864).\r\n\r\n‘The Woman of Samaria,’ a ‘sacred cantata’ by W. Sterndale Bennett\r\n(1816-75), was first performed at Birmingham August 27, 1867. The\r\nstory, taken from the fourth chapter of St. John’s Gospel, follows\r\nliterally the Bible narrative--Jesus’ journey to Samaria, his rest at\r\nthe well, and the entrance of the Samaritan woman. This is interspersed\r\nwith choral and solo passages, the former enacting the part of\r\nmoralist, commenting upon the situations as they occur by means of\r\nappropriate scriptural selections. The part of the Woman of Samaria is\r\nsung by the soprano, while the declamatory parts are assigned to the\r\ncontralto. The tenor has but one aria and the bass acts almost entirely\r\nas narrator, the Saviour’s words being always related in the third\r\nperson. In a single instance the chorus assumes the rôle of narrator,\r\n‘Now we believe,’ where the words are part of the story.\r\n\r\nA short instrumental prelude leads to the chorale, ‘Ye Christian\r\npeople now rejoice,’ for sopranos only. The melody used is an old one,\r\nhaving appeared in the _Geistliche Lieder_ (Wittenberg) in 1535. The\r\nchorale is interestingly treated by means of opposing rhythm in the\r\norchestral part. The recitative for contralto, ‘Then cometh Jesus to a\r\ncity of Samaria,’ opens the oratorio proper. After a chorus, ‘Blessed\r\nbe the Lord God of Israel,’ and short recitatives for bass, contralto\r\nand soprano, which are again followed by a chorus, there ensues the\r\nconversation between the Saviour and the woman, during which Jesus\r\ntells her of her past life. She replies in the beautiful contralto\r\nsolo, ‘O Lord, Thou hast searched me out,’ which is full of tender\r\nexpression. During the dialogue, the divine nature of Jesus is revealed\r\nto the woman and there follows the six-part chorus, ‘Therefore they\r\nshall come and sing,’ and this in turn is succeeded by the deeply\r\ndevotional and well-known quartet, ‘God is a Spirit,’ sung by the\r\nsolo voices _a cappella_. A soprano solo, ‘I will love Thee, O Lord,’\r\nwas introduced into the oratorio after the death of the composer,\r\namong whose manuscripts it was found. This was done for two reasons,\r\nto indicate the conversion of the woman and also to interrupt the\r\nseries of choruses. Among the remaining numbers are a lovely chorale,\r\n‘Abide with me, fast falls the eventide,’ and the fine chorus, ‘Now\r\nwe believe.’ The work is brought to a close with a majestic fugue,\r\n‘Blessed be the Lord God of Israel.’ An atmosphere of devotion pervades\r\nthe work and, while the composer recognizes the worldly character of\r\nthe woman, he sees also the possibilities of her intuitive religious\r\nfeeling, which the Master needed only to awaken.\r\n\r\nCosta’s ‘Eli’ was first produced at the Birmingham Festival, August\r\n29, 1855, under the direction of the composer. The text follows the\r\nscriptural narrative in the first book of Samuel and was arranged by\r\nWilliam Bartholomew. In a rather disconnected manner, and with the\r\nstory of young Samuel as a central point, it deals with the service of\r\nEli the priest, the carousals of his dissolute sons, the sorrows of\r\nElkanah and Hannah, and the exploits of the warlike Philistines. Some\r\nof the finer numbers of the oratorio are Eli’s sombre invocation, ‘Hear\r\nmy prayer, O Lord’; Hannah’s joyful song, ‘I will extol Thee, O Lord’;\r\nthe elaborate fugal chorus, ‘Hosanna in the highest,’ which closes the\r\nfirst part; the familiar orchestral march of the Israelites; Samuel’s\r\ndevout evening prayer, ‘This night I lift my heart to Thee,’ followed\r\nby the beautiful female chorus of angels with harp accompaniment, ‘No\r\nevil shall befall thee’; and the vigorous chorus, ‘Woe unto us, we are\r\nspoiled,’ sung by the Israelites when their crushing defeat by the\r\nPhilistines is announced.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                   VI\r\n\r\nThe oratorio in France had a slow beginning and has throughout its\r\ndevelopment displayed traits distinctly traceable to two sources, the\r\nfirst of which is the national fondness for theatrical settings for\r\nall dramatic works. Even _La nativité_ by Gossec (1734-1829) probably\r\ngained wide attention when given at the Tuileries Cathedral, because\r\nthe composer had a chorus of angels concealed in the dome, thereby\r\ngiving a more picturesquely dramatic effect. Concert-oratorio, in\r\nwhich the sources of enjoyment are largely limited to pure choral\r\neffects, divorced from dramatic content, has never made a wide appeal\r\nin France. The second source of the characteristics of French oratorio\r\nis to be found in the influence which the liturgy of the Roman Church\r\nhas exercised over this art-form. French oratorio has preserved a\r\nclose connection with the old Gallican liturgic drama of the Middle\r\nAges--so much so that the word ‘mystery’ has almost entirely superseded\r\n‘oratorio’ as a title or sub-title for this form of composition. Its\r\nline of descent from the mediæval mysteries is still further identified\r\nin the subject-matter itself, which usually concerns itself with the\r\nmysteries of Christian faith and church doctrine. The titles most\r\nfrequently subjoined by the composers are ‘sacred drama,’ ‘biblical\r\nscene,’ etc., rather than ‘oratorio.’ Here lies the distinct line of\r\ndemarcation between oratorio from the Protestant and Roman Catholic\r\npoints of view.\r\n\r\nThe first of the French composers to write a series of oratorios[80]\r\nwas François Lesueur (1760-1837) and the strongest of these is his\r\n‘Christmas Oratorio’ written in 1826, which is a combination of drama\r\nand churchly office. Lesueur was of the opinion that ecclesiastical\r\nmusic must of necessity be liturgical and therefore based on the\r\nGregorian chant and accent. This work is really an adaptation of the\r\nChristmas Mass treated as an oratorio-text, the parts of which are\r\ndistributed as solos, choruses and ensemble passages among the persons\r\nassembled around the manger. Most of these lightly scored passages are\r\nbuilt upon old liturgical melodies or upon old French Christmas songs,\r\nand the harp is very lavishly used in the instrumentation. The text is\r\nin Latin, taken from the Vulgate. After the _Kyrie_, accompanied by\r\nstring quartet, there follows the appearance of the angels, closing\r\nwith a short instrumental coda. After this comes a _Gloria in excelsis_\r\nand a pastoral instrumental passage (Shepherds on the Fields of\r\nBethlehem) scored for violas and horns. Two holy women sing as a duet\r\nthe _Gratias agimus tibi_ and the closing number consists of a pastoral\r\nhymn to the words, _Jam desinant suspiria_.\r\n\r\nOne of the most important of the French romantic oratorios is Hector\r\nBerlioz’s sacred trilogy, _L’enfance du Christ_ (‘The Childhood of\r\nChrist’), which was written in 1854 and performed in Paris and Brussels\r\nthe same year. This oratorio, dealing with the flight of the Holy\r\nFamily, is really an enlargement of an earlier cantata, _Fuite en\r\nEgypt_ (‘The Flight into Egypt’), and shows traces of the influence\r\nof Lesueur, whose pupil, Berlioz, caught the operatic spirit that was\r\nassociated with his master’s work. The oratorio, the text of which\r\nis by the composer, consists of three rather short parts--The Dream\r\nof Herod, The Flight into Egypt and The Arrival in Sais. The first\r\npart depicts Herod, tormented by awful dreams and influenced by the\r\nsoothsayers to kill the first-born men-children. The music is sombre,\r\nbut in the Herod passages takes on the operatic style referred to\r\nabove. In strong contrast to this is the second part, which deals\r\nentirely with the Holy Family and reveals qualities of loveliness and\r\nnaïveté as it depicts the babe Jesus greeted by the chorus of angels.\r\nThe most elaborate part is the third, especially the portion which\r\nreveals Joseph demanding shelter where he has been refused. Here the\r\nmusic assumes a dramatic and brilliant development.\r\n\r\nAlthough Charles Gounod (1818-93) after the extraordinary success\r\nof his masterpiece, ‘Faust,’ was firmly established as one of the\r\nforemost opera-composers of Europe, he never lost touch with religious\r\nmusic and finally abandoned the stage entirely for the style that lay\r\nclosest to his real ambition, becoming the greatest, if not indeed the\r\nonly great, composer of oratorio in France during this period. As a\r\nwinner of the _Grand Prix de Rome_ he had studied ecclesiastical music,\r\nespecially the works of Palestrina; during a visit to Vienna in 1842\r\nhe had produced a Requiem in the church of St. Charles, which created\r\na profound impression, and soon after returning to Paris he had even\r\nseriously thought of taking holy orders. Wide attention was first\r\nattracted to him by the London performance of portions of his _Messe\r\nsolennelle_, and even during the period of his greatest fame from his\r\nstage-works, he constantly reverted to the composition of sacred music.\r\nHis two great oratorios--‘The Redemption’ and _Mors et Vita_--strike\r\nout a somewhat new path for this art-form. Here he abandons entirely\r\nthe contrapuntal and fugal character of the chorus as being artificial\r\nand unessential, thus departing completely from Handelian and\r\nMendelssohnian models, and adopts from the Wagnerian music-drama the\r\nsystem of ‘leading motives,’ of which he makes limited use to designate\r\nimportant and representative religious or dramatic themes. Both of\r\nthese oratorios were composed for English audiences, and Gounod’s\r\nresidence in London after the Franco-Prussian War and his acquaintance\r\nwith the English festival oratorio undoubtedly colored the compositions\r\nto such an extent that they might almost be called English oratorios.\r\n\r\n‘The Redemption.’--This work was originally intended as the first\r\npart of a ‘Sacred Trilogy,’ as he styled it, only the second of which\r\n(_Mors et Vita_) was ever completed; the composition of the third was\r\nprevented by his death. The seriousness with which Gounod approached\r\nthis work is evidenced by the inscription--‘the work of my life’--which\r\nhe wrote on the opening page of the first of the great works, ‘The\r\nRedemption.’ This had been begun in 1867 in Rome, where the composer\r\nwrote his text and set a few numbers of the music, but it was not\r\ncompleted until twelve years later and the first performance took place\r\non August 30, 1882, at the Birmingham Festival. It was heard in Paris,\r\nMay 22nd, 1886, and for the first time in America in the winter of\r\n1883-1884 under the direction of Theodore Thomas. It is dedicated to\r\nQueen Victoria.\r\n\r\nIn the preface of his work Gounod states: ‘This work is a lyrical\r\nsetting forth of the three great facts on which depends the existence\r\nof the Christian Church. These facts are: 1. The Passion and the Death\r\nof the Saviour. 2. His glorious life on earth from His Resurrection\r\nto His Ascension. 3. The spread of Christianity in the world through\r\nthe mission of the Apostles.’ This trilogy is preceded by a ‘Prologue\r\non the creation, the fall of our first parents and the promise of the\r\nRedeemer.’ The work is divided in accordance with the above as follows:\r\n\r\nPrologue--The Creation.\r\n\r\nPart I.--Calvary.\r\n\r\nPart II.--From the Resurrection to the Ascension.\r\n\r\nPart III.--The Pentecost.\r\n\r\nThe personages are Jesus, Mary and two narrators. The composition,\r\nwhich by some is pronounced the finest of modern oratorios, is a\r\ncurious mixture of old and new ways of musical treatment. While Gounod,\r\nevidently influenced by Wagner, made use of ‘leading motives,’ he\r\nalso used the narrator in the same manner as did Bach and in like\r\nmanner treats the chorale. After a short instrumental introduction,\r\ndescriptive of chaos, and the narrator’s recitative concerning the\r\nfall of man, the Redemption theme is heard and it appears wherever the\r\natonement is thought of. This beautiful leading motive is heard nine\r\ntimes during the course of the work and is most effectively introduced\r\nin the first chorus, ‘The earth is my possession.’ Its most touching\r\nuse is where Jesus tells the dying malefactor, ‘To-day shalt thou be\r\nwith Me in Paradise,’ and its most impressively triumphant appearance\r\nis in the orchestral part at the close of the splendid chorus, ‘Unfold,\r\nye portals everlasting.’\r\n\r\nThe first part treats of the condemnation of Jesus, the crucifixion,\r\nMary at the foot of the cross and Jesus’ conversation with the two\r\nthieves. It contains some finely written solos and choruses, and\r\nthe two instrumental numbers--‘The March to Calvary’ and the number\r\ndescriptive of the darkness that fell over the earth as Jesus uttered\r\nhis last words. The second part includes the events in the period\r\nbetween the Resurrection and the Ascension. Among the beautiful\r\nnumbers in this part are the trio of Holy Women (two sopranos and a\r\ncontralto) ‘The Lord, He is risen again,’ and the lovely chorus with\r\nsoprano obbligato, ‘From Thy love as a Father.’ Possibly the strongest\r\nchorus in the whole work is ‘Unfold, ye portals everlasting,’ which\r\nis so often sung as a separate chorus number. The third part with\r\nits beautiful orchestral introduction has for its first chorus the\r\nmelodious ‘Lovely appear over the mountains,’ followed by one of the\r\nmost exquisite portions of the whole work, the soprano solo, ‘Over\r\nthe barren wastes.’ After a repetition of the preceding chorus, there\r\nfollow the impressive events of the day of Pentecost, the Apostles at\r\nprayer (for orchestra alone), the descent of the Spirit and the singing\r\nof the Beatitudes. The close is a repetition of the majestic apostles’\r\nhymn in unison, with the whole chorus, orchestra and organ massed in a\r\nmagnificent structure with grandiose effect.\r\n\r\n_Mors et Vita_ is the second of his contemplated ‘sacred trilogy,’ of\r\nwhich ‘The Redemption’ was the first. The Latin text is compiled from\r\nthe Catholic liturgy and from the Vulgate, and the work is dedicated\r\nto Pope Leo XIII. The first performance took place at the Birmingham\r\nFestival, August 26, 1885, under the direction of Richter, and the\r\nfirst performance in Paris, in May, 1886. Gounod writes in the preface:\r\n‘It will perhaps be asked why, in the title, I have placed death before\r\nlife. It is because in the order of eternal things death precedes life,\r\nalthough in the order of temporal things life precedes death.’ He also\r\nrefers to his use of ‘leading motives,’ which are also employed in\r\n‘The Redemption.’ There are four of these, the first of which, a theme\r\nmade up of four tones (a sequence of three major seconds), is supposed\r\nto express ‘the terror inspired by the sense of the inflexibility of\r\nJustice and, in consequence, by that of the anguish of punishment. Its\r\nsternness gives expression both to the sentences of Divine Justice and\r\nthe sufferings of the condemned, and is found in combination throughout\r\nthe whole work with melodic forms which express sentiments altogether\r\ndifferent, as in the _Sanctus_ and the _Pie Jesu_ of the _Requiem_\r\nwhich forms the first part.’ The second, the motive of sorrow and\r\ntears, is, by the alteration of one tone, changed into a motive of joy.\r\nOf the fourth, Gounod writes: ‘By means of a threefold superposition,\r\nit results in the interval of an augmented fifth and announces the\r\nawakening of the dead at the terrifying call of the angelic trumpets,\r\nof which St. Paul speaks in one of his epistles to the Corinthians.’\r\n\r\nA short Prologue leads to the first part, _Mors_ (Death), which is a\r\n_Requiem_ expanded by interpolated texts of a reflective character.\r\nThe second part, called _Judicium_ (Last Judgment), contains six\r\nsubdivisions, as follows: The Sleep of the Dead, The Trumpets at the\r\nLast Judgment, The Resurrection of the Dead, The Judge, The Judgment of\r\nthe Elect, The Judgment of the Rejected. The third part, _Vita_ (Life),\r\nusing the text of St. John’s vision in the Apocalypse, describes the\r\njoys of the Holy City, New Jerusalem, closing with an exultant _Hosanna\r\nin excelsis_.\r\n\r\nAmong the finest choruses of the oratorio are the _Quid sum miser_\r\n(‘Ah! What shall we then be pleading’) and the _Lacrymosa dies illa_\r\n(‘Day of weeping, day of mourning’) from the _Dies iræ_. Probably the\r\ngreatest aria of the work is the soprano solo, _Beati qui lavant_ (‘The\r\nrighteous shall enter into Glory Eternal’).\r\n\r\nThe theme which Gounod has chosen presents opportunities for orchestral\r\neffects which such a master of orchestration as he was would naturally\r\nseize upon, and several of the numbers are for orchestra alone--The\r\nEpilogue to the first part, in which the various leading motives are\r\ndeveloped, The Judge, and The Heavenly Jerusalem.\r\n\r\n\r\n                              FOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[80] These oratorios were, in addition to the one named, ‘Deborah,’\r\n‘Rachel,’ ‘Ruth and Naomi,’ ‘Ruth and Boaz,’ and the three ‘Coronation\r\nOratorios’ written for the three days’ coronation ceremonies of\r\nNapoleon in 1804 (in reality three masses expanded so as to include the\r\nspecial ceremonies).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                               CHAPTER IX\r\n\r\n                          THE MODERN ORATORIO\r\n\r\n     Brahms: ‘German Requiem’; Dvořák: ‘St. Ludmila’--César\r\n     Franck: ‘The Beatitudes’--Tinel: ‘Franciscus’; Benoît:\r\n     ‘Lucifer’--Saint-Saëns: ‘Christmas Oratorio’; ‘The Deluge’;\r\n     Massenet: _Ève_; _Marie Madeleine_; Dubois: ‘Paradise\r\n     Lost’--Oratorio in England; Mackenzie: ‘The Rose of Sharon’;\r\n     ‘Bethlehem’; Parry: ‘Judith’; ‘Job’; ‘King Saul’--Stanford:\r\n     ‘The Three Holy Children’; ‘Eden’; Sullivan: ‘The Prodigal\r\n     Son’; ‘The Light of the World’; Cowen--Oratorio in America;\r\n     Paine: ‘St. Peter’; Horatio Parker: _Hora Novissima_; ‘The\r\n     Legend of St. Christopher.’\r\n\r\n\r\n                                   I\r\n\r\n‘The German Requiem’ is the largest of Brahms’ several choral works\r\nand was the first of his compositions to bring him fame and to verify\r\nSchumann’s enthusiastic prophecy concerning him. The work, consisting\r\nof seven numbers, is mainly choral, though there are baritone and\r\nsoprano solos, and it was first heard in its entirety at Bremen on Good\r\nFriday, 1868. Its first English performance was in 1873 and it was\r\nheard for the first time in America at the Cincinnati May Festival in\r\n1884 under Theodore Thomas’ direction.\r\n\r\nThe title ‘Requiem’ is in a measure misleading, as it has nothing\r\nin common with the setting of the Catholic Mass for the Dead. It is\r\nmuch broader in scope than the customary use of this term as a form\r\nof religious music would imply. While it points out the emptiness and\r\nvanity of material life, its dominant note is one of consolation,\r\nexpanding into joy and leading to the ultimate triumph over death and\r\nthe grave. The composition of the ‘German Requiem’ was suggested by the\r\ndeath of the composer’s mother in 1865 and the work itself is generally\r\nregarded as Brahms’ masterpiece, Maitland going so far as to call it\r\n‘the greatest achievement of modern sacred music in Germany.’\r\n\r\nThe first chorus, ‘Blessed are they that go mourning,’ is a beautiful\r\ncomposition, its charm being greatly enhanced by its rich orchestral\r\naccompaniment. No. 2, the Funeral March, is written in triple time,\r\nwhich through Brahms’ magic is made to express vividly the measured\r\ntread of the mourners. No. 3, ‘Lord, make me to know the measure of\r\nmy days on earth,’ consists of a baritone solo followed by two choral\r\nfugues which are very effective though of great difficulty. No. 4,\r\na chorus (‘How lovely is Thy dwelling-place, O Lord of Hosts’), is\r\nslower than its predecessor and is charmingly melodious. No. 5, ‘Ye\r\nnow are sorrowful, grieve not,’ for soprano solo and chorus, has\r\nrich passages of melody and discloses the composer’s great ability\r\nin song-writing. No. 6, for baritone solo and chorus (‘Here on earth\r\nwe have no continuing place, we seek now a heavenly one’), pictures\r\nthe resurrection of the dead in intricate fugal passages of wonderful\r\npower. No. 7, the finale (‘Blessed are the faithful who in the Lord are\r\nsleeping’), in contrast with the tumultuous strains which precede it,\r\noffers a calm and sweetly serious close to this remarkable work.\r\n\r\nDvořák’s ‘St. Ludmila’ is sometimes classed as a sacred cantata, but\r\nits breadth rather suggests its inclusion among oratorios. The poem,\r\nby Jaroslav Vrchlicky, is based on a Bohemian legend and sets forth\r\nthe worship of the heathen goddess Bába, the destruction of her statue\r\nby the Christian teacher Ivan, the conversion of Princess Ludmila and\r\nher future husband, Prince Bořivoy, and their baptism, which ushered\r\nin the Christianization of Bohemia. The work was written for the Leeds\r\nFestival, where it had its first presentation in 1886. While there\r\nare many suggestions of national folk-song and national idiom in the\r\nscore, Dvořák, in writing the music, doubtless had in mind English\r\nconditions, demands and tastes, in that he gave special prominence to\r\nthe choral parts and strove to develop charming and original melodies\r\nwith strongly rhythmic features.\r\n\r\nThe composition is in three parts. The first scene is laid in the\r\ncourtyard of Melnik Castle, where the people are gathered about the\r\nstatue of the goddess Bába in worship of Bohemian Pagan deities. An\r\nintroductory orchestral number depicts the dawn, following which are\r\nseveral solos and choruses of women and priests, in which the dawning\r\nday and the laughing springtime are joyously proclaimed. Ludmila enters\r\nwith an invocation to the goddess for blessings on the fatherland,\r\nclosing with the charming passage, ‘I long with childlike longing,’\r\nto which the chorus adds, ‘The gods are ever near.’ With the approach\r\nof Ivan, the serene music changes abruptly, as he implores them in\r\na strong, declamatory aria, ‘Give ear, ye people, one is our God.’\r\nAfter the destruction of the heathen statue by Ivan amid scenes of\r\ngreat confusion, Ludmila proclaims her faith in the doctrine which\r\nIvan preaches, and the part closes with choruses of lament and alarm\r\nby the people. The second part, after an orchestral prelude, discloses\r\nSvatava aiding her mistress in finding Ivan, whom they finally discover\r\nemerging from a cave. After Ludmila and Svatava have both declared\r\ntheir faith in Christianity, the music suddenly changes. The religious\r\nmood gives way to the merry sound of the hunt and the hunters’ chorus.\r\nPrince Bořivoy enters and relates how Ivan miraculously healed the\r\nwounded hind. As he sees Ludmila, he declares his love for her. Ivan\r\nexpounds his doctrine to the prince and the hunters, and Bořivoy is\r\nalso converted. When he again pours out his love for Ludmila, she\r\nat first replies, ‘To thee the pleasure of the chase belongs,’ but\r\nIvan urges her to bestow her hand upon the prince, and a quartet and\r\na chorus close the part. The scene of the third part is laid in the\r\ncathedral of Velehrad. The royal lovers are baptized, and the noble\r\nchorus, ‘Mighty Lord, to us be gracious,’ creates an exalted religious\r\natmosphere. At the conclusion of the ceremony the orchestra enters with\r\ntrumpet fanfares, followed by solos by Svatava and Ivan with choral\r\nresponses; and a powerful contrapuntal chorus, a final ‘Alleluia,’\r\nimpressively closes the work.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                   II\r\n\r\nThough Franck’s list of works is small compared with those of some\r\nof his fellow-composers, he touched every field of serious music and\r\nleft the impress of his powerful individuality. _Les Béatitudes_ (‘The\r\nBeatitudes’) is probably his finest work, though, after hearing his\r\nnoble D minor symphony or his striking piano quintet, one is reluctant\r\nto pass over either of these superb creations in naming Franck’s\r\nmasterpiece. He wrote five large choral works, though, in common with\r\nother French composers, he seldom used the title ‘oratorio.’ The first\r\none in oratorio-form was ‘Ruth and Boaz,’ written in 1845, which he\r\ndesignates _Églogue biblique_ and in which he is evidently struggling\r\nfor new harmonic effects, although he had not yet found the idiom\r\nwhich characterizes his later works. He follows the form of French\r\noratorios of this period, which were usually short, possibly because\r\nthis temperamental nation was not inclined to hear a long religious\r\nwork which, without any dramatic action, would occupy a whole evening.\r\nThe naïveté and simplicity of this youthful work won much admiration\r\nwhen it was first performed at the Conservatoire at Paris on January\r\n4, 1846. The picturesque orchestral prelude, the chorus of Moabites,\r\nRuth’s beautiful aria in the first part, the duet between Ruth and\r\nBoaz in the second part, the charming and original chorus of reapers\r\nwith its suggestion of an old French folk-song--these are some of\r\nthe beauties of this simple sacred idyl. _La Rédemption_, which the\r\ncomposer calls a _poème symphonique_, was finished Nov. 7, 1872, and\r\nwas first performed at the Concert National on April 10, 1873, under\r\nthe direction of Colonne. Franck’s mysticism becomes more apparent in\r\nthis work. While it is by no means on a level with the ‘Beatitudes,’\r\nsuch passages as the angels’ choruses, the arias of the archangel, the\r\nmusic expressing the joy of mankind at Christ’s advent, reveal the\r\ntender grace and purity of Franck’s inspirations. _Rébecca_, a Biblical\r\nidyl (_scène biblique_) on a poem by Paul Collin, dates from 1881,\r\nand is written in the simple style of his earlier ‘Ruth.’ An Oriental\r\natmosphere pervades the work and gives color to its harmonies and\r\nmodulations, as witness the opening chorus and the picturesque chorus\r\nof camel-drivers. In _Psyché_ Franck reaches his mature style. Written\r\nin 1887-88 and first performed at the _Concerts du Châtelet_ under\r\nColonne, Feb. 23, 1890, this quite lengthy work possesses many passages\r\nof ravishing beauty and elusive charm--such as the _Sommeil de Psyché_,\r\na prelude ‘full of mysterious language,’ and the music accompanying the\r\nscene where Psyché reposes among the flowers.\r\n\r\n‘The Beatitudes’ is a work in which Franck’s best and most\r\ncharacteristic qualities of thought and workmanship are displayed in\r\na wonderful degree. Of a deeply religious nature, profoundly earnest\r\nand sincere, working wholly for himself and his art-ideals, and wholly\r\noblivious of the indifference with which an unappreciative generation\r\nreceived his great works, Franck translated into music his own inner\r\nself to a degree that has been vouchsafed to very few composers. The\r\ngrandeur and religious significance of the underlying thoughts of this\r\ngreat theme struck deep into his gentle, tender nature and he was\r\nable to sustain a noble mode of musical speech from beginning to end\r\nwithout flagging. Three characteristics stand out prominently in his\r\nmusic--(1) a mysticism that throws a glamour of delicious vagueness of\r\noutline over all his modes of artistic expression, a mysticism that\r\nroots itself deep in the hidden things of the religious faith he so\r\nconsistently held, (2) a complex and intricate polyphony that rivals\r\nBach’s in its nobility and expressiveness, and (3) an astounding wealth\r\nof novel harmonies that elude analysis and enthrall the listener by\r\ntheir very elusiveness.\r\n\r\n‘The Beatitudes’ was begun in 1870 and was published ten years\r\nlater. Parts of it were performed in Paris from time to time, but the\r\nentire work did not come to public hearing until one year after the\r\ncomposer’s death--at Dijon in 1891 at the Commemoration Festival of\r\nSt. Bernard. Its first Paris performance was March 19, 1893, under\r\nColonne, and France at last awoke to the recognition of the greatness\r\nof her departed adopted son. The text is a poetic paraphrase of the\r\nSermon on the Mount, made by Madame Colomb. It is not altogether\r\nadequate and is interspersed with philosophical episodes that at times\r\nsuggest spiritualism and other irrelevant matter. Curiously enough it\r\nwas frequently these extraneous parts that touched Franck most deeply\r\nand occasioned some of his finest outbursts of religious rapture. The\r\nstrongest musical parts of the oratorio are the fine choral writing and\r\nthe skillful handling of the orchestra in exploiting and illustrating\r\nthe poetic and dramatic meaning of the text. In the orchestral numbers\r\nhis most brilliant style is revealed. His treatment of the various\r\ncharacters--Satan, the Voice of Christ, Mater Dolorosa--is often\r\nvery dramatic, almost theatrical: other characters are the Angel of\r\nForgiveness and the Angel of Death. The central theme which runs\r\nthrough the whole work is the perpetual conflict between good and evil,\r\nand ‘terrestrial’ and ‘celestial’ choruses are frequently used to\r\nillustrate these opposing forces.\r\n\r\nThe musical numbers of the oratorio naturally group themselves into\r\neight parts (preceded by a prologue) corresponding to the Gospel\r\nnarrative. The Christ motive is introduced in the music of the prologue\r\n(for tenor and celestial chorus) which establishes at once the mood of\r\nthe whole work. Of exquisite beauty and tenderness are the passages\r\nassigned to the voice of Christ (baritone) in the first part (‘Blessed\r\nhe, who, from earth’s dreams awaking’) and in the third and fourth\r\nparts. The celestial choruses are notable throughout for their tender\r\nnote of consolation and admonition, especially in the fifth part.\r\nFranck’s treatment of the whole of the third beatitude--‘Blessed\r\nare they that mourn’--is forceful and impressive, beginning with\r\nthe chorus, ‘Grief over all creatures,’ the strongest in the whole\r\noratorio. The most dramatic moments of the work are in the seventh\r\npart--‘Blessed are the peacemakers.’ His Satan, as the arch-inspirer\r\nof all strife and discord, appears as a figure of Miltonic grandeur.\r\nOpposed to his bitter denunciations and taunts are the gentle strains\r\nof the Christ voice (‘Blessed are they who, with voice beseeching’),\r\nwhich touch even Satan to a penitent mood (‘Ah! that voice’) and lead\r\ninto one of the most beautiful portions of the entire work, the famous\r\nquintet of peacemakers (‘Evil cannot stay’). The eighth part--‘Blessed\r\nare they which are persecuted for righteousness’ sake’--rivals the\r\nseventh in dramatic intensity and force. Satan, ‘not yet defeated,’\r\nagain hurls defiance at Christ. He is rebuked by the chorus of the just\r\nand finally gives way before the voice of the _Mater Dolorosa_ who\r\nsings a sublime song (‘Stricken with sorrow’). Satan recognizes his\r\ndoom, the voice of Christ is heard for the last time, and the celestial\r\nchorus responds with a triumphant Hosanna which brings the work to a\r\nclose.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                   III\r\n\r\n_Franciscus_ was the first work to bring Edgar Tinel (1854-1912)\r\ninternational fame. While preceding works had brought him success, the\r\nsound musicianship of this oratorio, its beauties of contrapuntal and\r\norchestral structure, won for its composer a wide recognition beyond\r\nthe boundaries of his native Belgium as one of the ablest contemporary\r\nchoral writers. He has written much church-music and has evinced strong\r\ninterest in the reform of Gregorian chant and ecclesiastical music\r\nwhich has stirred the Roman Church since the middle of the nineteenth\r\ncentury. It was while he was director of the Institute for Sacred Music\r\nat Malines that he composed ‘Franciscus,’ generally regarded as his\r\nmasterpiece, and it was produced there, August 22, 1888. It was one of\r\nthe works performed at the Lower Rhine Festival in 1894 and was heard\r\nfor the first time in England in 1895 at the Cardiff Festival. Before\r\neither German or English performance, however, it had been brought out\r\nin New York City in 1893. The librettist, Lodemijk de Koninck, has\r\nwoven into the lines of his poem all the salient features of the life\r\nof St. Francis of Assisi (1181-1226), ‘the adorable mediæval mystic who\r\ninvited all beings and all things to divine love,’ and who became the\r\nfounder of the great mendicant order of Franciscan monks.\r\n\r\nThe oratorio is divided into three parts. The first--‘Francis’\r\nWorldly Life and his Renunciation’--opens with a sonorous prelude\r\ndeveloped from a theme of stately character and discloses a brilliant\r\nscene of court life at Assisi, where knights and ladies hold high feast\r\namid the beauty of an Italian night. There is dancing and merriment and\r\nthe gay Francis is called upon for a song. He astonishes the guests by\r\nsinging the Ballad of Poverty, which, with its quaint unaccompanied\r\nchoral refrains, forms one of the most delightful musical passages\r\nin the work. On his way home after the festivities he hears a voice\r\nspeaking his name. Later in his chamber he hears the same heavenly\r\nvoice and sees a vision of a magnificent hall, hung with cross-bedecked\r\narmor, wherein a noble maiden, Poverty, walks. The heavenly voice\r\ntells him that Poverty shall be his bride, his weapon the cross, and\r\nhis mission to convert the world. The second part pictures ‘Francis’\r\nMonastic Life’ and teems with the fantastic episodes with which\r\nmediæval legends allegorically associated the lives of the church\r\nfathers and saints. It introduces the angels of Hope, of Love, and\r\nof Peace, against whom the spirits of War and of Hate wage battle.\r\nFrancis, worn with fasting, bare-foot and clad in a monk’s gray garb,\r\ncomes from his cell. His former companions no longer know him, and\r\njeer him as he tells them of his lovely bride, Poverty. He sings the\r\nbeautiful, pathetic Song of Poverty, _Erbarm’ Dich meiner Noth, O\r\nHerr!_ (‘Have mercy on my need, O Lord!’). Taught by him they learn\r\nthe meaning of brotherly love and peace reigns on earth. Francis’\r\nHymn to the Sun with choral accompaniment, the deeply expressive Song\r\nof Love and the closing chorus of celestial voices, are among the\r\nrarest gems of the work. The third part deals with ‘Francis’ Death and\r\nGlorification,’ the finest numbers of which are the angelus chorus\r\nwhich he hears at evening as he lies on his death-bed; the double\r\nchorus in the church scene (_Lux æterna_), in which the solemn tones\r\nof the organ join with contrasting celestial and earthly choirs; the\r\nimposingly heroic funeral march; and the final scene, in which the\r\ncomposer masses chorus on chorus with tremendous cumulative effect,\r\nclosing with the words, ‘Triumph! Glory be to God!’\r\n\r\nPierre Léopold Benoît (b. 1834), a consistent propagandist for Flemish\r\nmusic, has been foremost in the movement to establish a national school\r\nof music distinct from French and German schools. In aiding this\r\nmovement he has himself been a prolific writer in many fields. His\r\nchoral works include the six oratorios--_Lucifer_ (1866), _Die Schelde_\r\n(1869), _Prometheus_ (1868), _Der Krieg_ (1880), _Der Rhein_ (1889)\r\nand the ‘Children’s Oratorio’--a choral symphony (‘The Mowers’), and\r\nin addition many cantatas, among them one for children’s voices (‘Into\r\nthe World’), of great beauty and practical value for school purposes.\r\nIn style Benoît is influenced sometimes by Franck and sometimes by\r\nSchumann and the later Germans; there are few traces of a strongly\r\nindividual style.\r\n\r\n_Lucifer_, Benoît’s most important composition and one of the best\r\nof its period, was written in 1865 and first performed in Brussels in\r\n1866. The text is by Emanuel Hiel. It shows distinctly the presence of\r\na progressive spirit in Belgium and France, though the former country\r\nwelcomed the oratorio more heartily than did the latter. The subject is\r\nthe thrice-attempted effort of Satan to gain victory over a divinely\r\nprotected humanity; but the text is so allegorical and so unskillfully\r\nput together that it no longer takes hold of the listener’s interest.\r\nPortions of the work, especially the agitated passages, are\r\ncharacterized by unrestrained emotional expression. The solos are\r\ngenerally pleasing and lyric, though not deep--the whole affording\r\ncontrasts which hold the attention. The orchestration is brilliant for\r\nthe period and the choral-writing skillful. The employment of leading\r\nmotives, to which the composer himself called attention (though as a\r\nwhole they are not very characteristic), stamped the work as being very\r\nmodern in style at the time it was written. It no doubt had a large\r\ninfluence on Benoît’s contemporaries, especially on Franck, whose later\r\noratorios, though constructed with vastly greater skill and genius,\r\nshow many similar traits.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                   IV\r\n\r\nThe ‘Christmas Oratorio’ (_Noël_) of Charles Camille Saint-Saëns (born\r\n1835), although constructed in the oratorio style, scarcely exceeds the\r\ndimensions of a cantata. It calls for five soloists, and is scored for\r\nstrings, organ and, in one number, the harp. While the text is based on\r\nthe story of the Nativity, only two numbers mention the birth of Jesus\r\nand these at the beginning of the work, the remainder being liturgical\r\nmatter, such as the Magnificat, Benedictus and Gloria Patri, and the\r\ntriumph of the Church--all appropriate to the Christmas season. A\r\nquaint and melodious pastoral introduction of some length leads into a\r\nrecitative, ‘And there were shepherds,’ after which the announcement to\r\nthe shepherds is apportioned among three solo voices, closing with the\r\nchorus, ‘Glory to God in the highest.’ The most dramatic chorus in the\r\nwork is ‘Wherefore are the nations raging,’ to which the accompaniment\r\nin itself furnishes an atmosphere of wild unrest. A portion of the\r\nopening pastoral prelude is heard again in the next to the last number,\r\nbefore the quintet takes up the words, ‘Arise now, Daughter of Zion,’\r\nwhich, especially in the ‘Alleluia’ portion, contains some beautiful\r\nwriting for the solo voices. A final chorus, written in majestic hymn\r\nstyle and also closing with an oft-repeated ‘Alleluia,’ concludes the\r\noratorio. The composition, though short, is exceedingly beautiful, not\r\nonly in its graceful and melodious voice-parts, but in its delicate and\r\nstriking accompaniments.\r\n\r\n‘The Deluge,’ a biblical scene which Saint-Saëns wrote in 1875, has\r\nsteadily maintained its place in the choral repertoire. It is an\r\neffective, artistic work, nobly conceived and true to the scriptural\r\nnarrative. The orchestra takes a leading part in the vivid portrayal\r\nof the commotions of Nature--the approaching rain, gradually bursting\r\ninto torrents, the rising of the flood, the buoyancy of the ark as\r\nit ‘floated upon the mournful ocean,’ the darkness, and finally the\r\nreceding waters. The narration of the most important events is given to\r\nthe chorus, while the minor incidents are delegated to the soloists,\r\nlargely in recitative. Especially effective is the passage at the\r\nbeginning of the second part in which it is related that ‘the sun\r\ndisappeared’ and ‘the rains from heaven poured,’ where the choral parts\r\nhave little melodic movement, dwelling much on one tone, as though awed\r\nat the magnitude of the calamity, while the storm-tossed accompaniment\r\nvividly depicts the fierce force of the elements. One of the finest\r\nnumbers is the fugal chorus, ‘This race will I blot out forever.’\r\nIn striking contrast to this is the delicately scored scene of the\r\ndeparting and the returning dove and the rainbow-music. The work closes\r\nwith a massive contrapuntal chorus, in which the solo quartet joins,\r\n‘Now increase, grow and multiply.’\r\n\r\nJules Massenet (1842-1912) has made several excursions into the field\r\nof choral music, but has never been quite able to throw off his\r\ntheatrical associations. His oratorios are _Ève_ (1875), _La Vierge_\r\n(‘The Holy Virgin’), a sacred legend in four scenes (1880), and _La\r\nterre promise_ (‘The Promised Land,’ 1900). In addition is a four-act\r\nsacred drama, _Marie Madeleine_ (1873), which is utterly theatrical.\r\n\r\n_Ève_, a mystery which Massenet wrote in 1875, though not deeply\r\nconceived, is full of beautiful color. It is in three parts, the first\r\nbeing ‘The Birth of Woman.’ At the beginning of the part the composer\r\nhas written in the score: ‘Serene Nature round Man in his sleep. A pure\r\nlight is spread over Creation, and from the new-born Earth light vapors\r\nillumined by the Sun rise on the horizon. A soft breeze undulates the\r\nflowers of the field and the waves of the sea.’ Part second, ‘Eve in\r\nSolitude’ (The Temptation), bears this superscription: ‘Starlit sky.\r\nA balmy night. In the forest solitude Eve walks in deep thought far\r\nfrom Adam. Trembling and enchanted she listens to the voices of the\r\nnight which murmur around her.’ In these surroundings she sings an\r\naria of narcotic sweetness, _O nuit, douce nuit_ (‘O night! gentle\r\nnight’), which discloses how receptive she is to the alluring voices\r\nof sweet temptation. The third part is ‘The Fall.’ It is impossible\r\nto think of Massenet’s character of Eve with any degree of sympathy,\r\nas she is depicted simply as an easily tempted Parisienne, with all\r\nthe characteristics of a frail and sentimental woman. According to the\r\ntext, she plucks from the tree, not the fruit of the knowledge of good\r\nand evil, but of love, which is here styled ‘the forbidden fruit.’ The\r\neating of the fruit brings on a rapturous love-duet (_con passione_) in\r\ntrue theatrical style, and the happy pair are banished from Eden--for\r\nloving!\r\n\r\n_Marie Madeleine_, a work which Massenet calls a sacred drama, was\r\nwritten in 1873 and performed at the Odéon Théâtre, Paris, the same\r\nyear. It consists of three acts, (1) Magdalen at the Fountain,\r\n(2) Jesus before Mary Magdalene, (3) Golgotha, including the\r\nscenes, ‘Magdalen at the Cross,’ ‘At the Tomb of Jesus,’ and the\r\n‘Resurrection.’ The persons represented are Mary Magdalene, Martha,\r\nJesus and Judas, together with choruses of disciples, Pharisees,\r\nscribes, publicans, soldiers, servants, holy women and people.\r\n\r\nOne who is in sympathy with the inspiring Bible narrative, so\r\nbeautifully treated in dramatic literature, finds it difficult to\r\nbecome reconciled to the extraneous, irrelevant material brought into\r\nthe text and elaborated in the music--for example, the introduction of\r\nJudas as a lover of the Magdalen and a chorus of women who taunt her.\r\nThe music abounds in dramatic, Oriental coloring and rich melody. The\r\ntwo tableaux in the third act are very realistic, the first presenting\r\nthe ‘Crucifixion,’ and the second, the ‘Ascension.’\r\n\r\nThéodore Dubois (b. 1837) has worked much in the field of choral music.\r\nBesides many pieces of church-music and five cantatas, he has written\r\nthree oratorios--‘The Seven Last Words of Christ’ (1867), a short and\r\neasy setting of the familiar Passion-scene; ‘Paradise Lost,’ which is\r\ngiven some space below; and _Nôtre-Dame de la Mer_ (1897).\r\n\r\n‘Paradise Lost’ (_Le Paradis perdu_), for the composition of which\r\nDubois won the City of Paris prize in 1878, is a dramatic oratorio in\r\nfour parts. The text, by Édouard Bau, is based on Milton’s great poem.\r\nIt is a fresh, spontaneous work, and abounds in striking tone-pictures,\r\nthe most unique of which is the fierce struggle in Part I between the\r\nforces of Heaven and of Hell (the faithful and the rebellious angels).\r\nThe superscription of the orchestral introduction is a commentary on\r\nthe sombre nature of the music: ‘Before the Creation of our Earth,\r\nwhile Chaos yet reigned ... the host of angels, called from the ends\r\nof Heaven, assembled before the throne of the Almighty.’ This prelude\r\nis at once followed by the chorus of seraphim and the recitative of\r\nthe Archangel. The first two parts, ‘The Revolt’ and ‘Hell,’ portray\r\nthe contest of Satan and his angels against the archangels and the\r\nfaithful, and the condition of the lost angels in their new abode of\r\ntorment. The third part, ‘Paradise,’ includes the temptation and the\r\nfall of man, and the fourth, ‘The Judgment,’ tells of the upheaval\r\non the earth, the despair of Adam and Eve and their expulsion from\r\nParadise. Among the best portions of the work might be named the\r\nopening of Part III, a beautiful picture of a morning in Paradise\r\n(ushered in by the orchestra and taken up chorally by the spirits who\r\nguard Eden); the simple, devout prayer of Adam and Eve (in duet form);\r\nand a grandiose concerted piece, ‘O God, avenging and righteous,’ which\r\nis sung by Adam, Eve, the Archangel and the chorus of seraphim. The\r\ncharacterization of Satan is particularly strong throughout the work.\r\nInteresting is the French viewpoint, which depicts the chivalrous Adam\r\nunwilling to allow the blame for the first sin to rest upon his spouse:\r\n‘Pardon the woman.... I ‘twas who led her astray!’ he pleads before the\r\nArchangel who passes sentence upon the guilty pair. Many pages of the\r\nmusic approach closely to the boundaries of sentimentality.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                   V\r\n\r\nIn the field of English oratorio we find the same contributing\r\ncomposers as in the cantata-form of this period and the same\r\nprogressive spirit and virile qualities that sought out and found\r\nindividual forms of expression (see Chapter VI). The principal oratorio\r\nwriters of the period in the United Kingdom are Mackenzie, Parry,\r\nStanford, Sullivan and Cowen.\r\n\r\n‘The Rose of Sharon,’ a dramatic oratorio by Alexander Campbell\r\nMackenzie (born 1847), was first produced at the Norwich Festival,\r\nOct. 16. 1884, the composer conducting. Mackenzie speaks of the\r\nproduction of this work as the ‘turning point’ of his career. The\r\nfirst performance met with enormous success and it was received in\r\nall parts of the United Kingdom with extraordinary marks of approval.\r\nThe text by Joseph Bennett is based upon the Song of Solomon and the\r\npersons represented are the Sulamite (the Rose of Sharon), a woman (the\r\nnarrator), the Beloved and Solomon, the chorus being variously made\r\nup of princes, nobles, officers of the court, elders, villagers and\r\nsoldiers. It is in four parts in addition to a prologue which indicates\r\nthe parabolic character of the drama and an epilogue which points\r\nits moral. The four parts are: (1) Separation, (2) Temptation, (3)\r\nVictory, and (4) Reunion. The principal motive of the work is revealed\r\nin the words which the Sulamite sings--‘Love is strong as death and\r\nunconquerable as the grave.’\r\n\r\nThe story relates how the Sulamite is seen by Solomon, who at once\r\nbecomes enamored of her and tears her away from her Beloved, placing\r\nher in his own harem, where, although surrounded by every luxury which\r\nroyal favor can devise, she still remains loyal to her Beloved. After\r\nevery effort on the part of Solomon, the nobles and the women of the\r\ncourt, the Sulamite continues to sing ‘My Beloved pastures his flock\r\namong the lilies’ and she is finally restored to him, after which they\r\nreturn together to the vineyards. The score is heavily loaded with\r\nbeautiful passages--lyric, pastoral and dramatic--for choral and solo\r\nparts alike. The composer uses with great skill and effectiveness four\r\nmotives--the Love motive associated with the above quotation and a\r\nmotive associated with each of the three principal characters. Some\r\nof the loveliest parts of the work are the long dialogue between the\r\nSulamite and her Beloved in the first part; the simple ‘The Lord is my\r\nShepherd’ which the Sulamite, alone in Solomon’s palace, devoutly sings\r\nas she longingly remembers the scenes from which she has been parted;\r\nthe stately chorus, ‘Make a joyful noise unto the Lord,’ accompanying\r\nthe procession of the ark; the chorus of shepherds and vine-dressers;\r\nthe jubilant chorus, ‘Sing, O Heavens! be joyful, O Earth!’ as the\r\nvillagers greet the returning lovers, which chorus leads into a\r\nrapturous duet that prepares the way for a chorale-like finale in which\r\nall join.\r\n\r\n‘Bethlehem’ is a mystery in two acts, Mackenzie here using this term in\r\npreference to ‘oratorio’ as better indicating the nature of the work,\r\nwhich preserves a quaintness of narrative style throughout. The text is\r\nby Joseph Bennett and the work made its appearance in 1894. The events\r\nof the first act or part take place in the fields of Bethlehem, where\r\nangels appear to the shepherds, comforting them with good news and\r\nsinging an anthem of praise to God, returning to heaven and leaving the\r\nshepherds astounded at the vision. They talk together of the wondrous\r\nsight and, as dawn appears, the people of Bethlehem gather together\r\nand they all rejoice and sing a carol. The scene of the second act is\r\nBethlehem. A host of ‘arméd cherubim’ guard the new-born King as the\r\nblessed mother sweetly sings to her babe. But the shepherds with some\r\npeople of Bethlehem seek the Holy Babe through the city to worship Him;\r\nlikewise certain kings from the East, whose salutations the blessed\r\nmother answers. As the kings marvel and offer gifts, all join in humble\r\nand devout adoration of the Holy Child. The quaintness of style is\r\npreserved in the music also, yet without sacrificing its dignity.\r\n\r\n‘Judith’ (‘The Regeneration of Manasseh’) was the first oratorio\r\nof Parry (b. 1848), although he had already written several of the\r\nlong series of choral works that mark him as one of England’s great\r\ncomposers. It was produced at the Birmingham Festival of 1888. The\r\npersons in the action are Manasseh, king of Israel; Meshullemeth, his\r\nwife; his children; Judith; a High Priest of Moloch; and a messenger of\r\nHolofernes. The text, by the composer, is in two acts. In the first,\r\nthe priests of Moloch demand the children of Manasseh for sacrifice,\r\nbut as they are about to be offered up, Judith appears and endeavors\r\nto save them. She is herself saved from the wrath of the people only\r\nby the coming of the Assyrians, who lay Jerusalem in ruins and carry\r\noff Manasseh a prisoner to Babylon. But the captive king repents of\r\nhis sins against God and is permitted to return to Jerusalem. In the\r\nsecond act, while the Jews are lamenting over the desolation of their\r\ncity, a messenger from the Assyrian general, Holofernes, arrives and\r\ndemands new terms of submission and tribute. Here Judith comes to the\r\nrescue; she exhorts the Jews to have confidence in God’s help, makes\r\nher way to the Assyrian camp and to the tent of Holofernes and strikes\r\nhim down with her own hand. The Israelites, fired by her heroism,\r\nfall upon their bewildered enemies and scatter them, returning to\r\nJerusalem and praising the God of Israel. The Moloch choruses are very\r\ncharacteristic, some of them fierce and barbaric, while the march\r\nof the Assyrian host at the close of the first part is stately and\r\nmajestic. One of the loveliest parts is the scene between Meshullemeth\r\nand her children as she sings, in answer to their questions, the\r\nsimple, pathetic ballad of Israel’s ancient escape from Egypt and the\r\nRed Sea.\r\n\r\n‘Job’ was written for the Gloucester Festival of 1892 and is much\r\nshorter than the preceding oratorio. Parry’s treatment of the familiar\r\nstory of the patriarch’s misfortunes is at once individual and poetic.\r\nHe groups the events into four scenes, opening the first one with a\r\nnoble, serene theme in the orchestra, associated with the ‘perfect\r\nand upright man that feared God,’ and appropriately using it again to\r\nbring the whole work to a close. The narrator is given an important\r\nrôle, but the climax of the work is Job’s lengthy lament for his losses\r\nin the third scene. The music is noble and of sustained dignity and\r\nimpressiveness.\r\n\r\n‘King Saul,’ Parry’s third oratorio, was performed at the Birmingham\r\nFestival of 1894. It relates, in a series of ten scenes grouped into\r\nfour acts, the main events in the picturesque life of this king\r\nof Israel. The prophet Samuel and the youthful shepherd David are\r\nprominent persons in the narrative, while the introduction of the Witch\r\nof Endor scene gives opportunity for music of vividly descriptive\r\ncharacter. Among many fine lyric passages are the love-duet of David\r\nand Michal and David’s devotional psalm after the battle with the\r\nPhilistines (‘Let us lift up our eyes unto the mountains, whence cometh\r\nour help’). The choral-writing throughout is marked by unerring skill\r\nand noteworthy effectiveness.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                   VI\r\n\r\n‘The Three Holy Children,’ by Sir Charles Villiers Stanford (born\r\n1852), was written for the Birmingham Festival of 1885. The words\r\nare taken in the main from those parts of the Old Testament and\r\nthe Apocrypha that deal with the captivity of the Jews under\r\nNebuchadnezzar, king of Babylon. This king had erected a great image of\r\nBel in the valley of Dura and commanded that all his subjects worship\r\nit under penalty of death by fire. A company of Jewish women, by the\r\nwaters of Babylon, are mourning over their captivity, when they are\r\ntaunted by some Assyrian soldiers on their way to worship Bel and\r\nthey reply with songs of their beloved country and with imprecations\r\non their enemies. Ananias, Azarias and Misael, three prominent Jews,\r\ndenounce the worship of idols and refuse to bow down to Bel. They are\r\ndragged before the king and cast into the fiery furnace; but the flames\r\ndo them no harm and the amazed king releases them and joins with the\r\nmultitude in praising God ‘that hath sent His angel and delivered His\r\nservants that trusted in Him.’\r\n\r\n‘Eden,’ a dramatic oratorio, is a strong setting of Robert Bridges’\r\npoem and found first presentation, as have several others of Stanford’s\r\nchoral works, at the Birmingham Festival, this one in 1891. The poem\r\nis an elaborate epic of large dimensions, involving in its action many\r\ncharacters (Adam, Eve, Satan, Michael, Angels of Earth, Sun, Music,\r\nPoetry, etc.) and for its choral elements, calling upon angels, devils,\r\nfuries, all-seers, etc. With this complicated dramatic machinery\r\nStanford has built an imposing musical structure--grand, terrible in\r\nplaces, of ravishing beauty in others--always skillfully fashioned\r\nand of compelling appeal, especially in the choral parts. The poem is\r\ndivided into three acts: I, Heaven; II, Hell; III, Earth (Part 1, The\r\nFall; Part 2, Adam’s Vision). In the first and third acts the composer\r\ndrops into the old ecclesiastical modal style for pages at a time with\r\nbeautiful effect. Indeed, he takes for some of his most important\r\nthematic material two phrases of the plain-song melody _Sanctorum\r\nmeritis_ (from the _Sarum Missal_) and weaves them into choral passages\r\nwith the skill of a sixteenth-century church-contrapuntist. Especially\r\nbeautiful, among such portions, are the opening six-part chorus of all\r\nangels (‘God of might! God of love!’) and a five-part _a cappella_\r\nchorus (‘Flames of pure love are we’)--the latter in the pure style of\r\na _Madrigale spirituale_.\r\n\r\n‘The Prodigal Son,’ which is the first of Sullivan’s oratorios,\r\nreceived its first performance at the Worcester Festival, Sept.\r\n3, 1869, for which occasion it was written. The text, compiled by\r\nthe composer, is based on the well-known parable, the shortness of\r\nwhich, however, has necessitated the introduction of other Scriptural\r\nmaterial; so that only six of the eighteen numbers deal directly\r\nwith the narrative, while the other twelve reflect on the lessons it\r\nteaches. In a preface to the work, Sullivan explains his conception of\r\nthe Prodigal as ‘a buoyant, restless youth, tired of the monotony of\r\nhome, and anxious to see what lay beyond the confines of his father’s\r\nfarm, going away in the confidence of his own simplicity and ardor, and\r\nled gradually away into the follies and sins which at the outset would\r\nhave been distasteful to him.’\r\n\r\nThe musical treatment is melodious, opening, after a short orchestral\r\nprelude, with the joyous, though reflective, chorus, ‘There is joy in\r\nthe presence of the angels of God,’ preceded by a brief soprano solo.\r\nThe parable then opens with tenor recitative and aria, ‘A certain man\r\nhad two sons,’ and armed with the good counsel of his father, the\r\nprodigal son starts away. He is heard from in the chorus of revelry,\r\n‘Let us eat and drink; to-morrow we die.’ The admonishing contralto\r\nsolo, ‘Love not the world,’ is well known, having found its way to\r\nconcert programs. After an orchestral prelude the soprano declaims in\r\nrecitative the Prodigal’s experience as a swineherd and his struggle\r\nwith famine, closing with the aria, ‘O that thou had’st harkened.’\r\nThe repentance of the Prodigal is beautifully expressed in the tenor\r\naria, ‘How many hired servants of my father.’ A chorus, ‘The sacrifices\r\nof God,’ is followed by the Prodigal’s return--the joy of the father\r\nbeing expressed in the bass aria, ‘For this my son was dead.’ One of\r\nthe finest choruses in the work, ‘O that men would praise the Lord,’\r\nis soon followed by the unaccompanied quartet, ‘The Lord is nigh,’ and\r\nthe final chorus, ‘Thou, O Lord, art our Father,’ closes with a joyous\r\n‘Hallelujah.’\r\n\r\n‘The Light of the World,’ the second of Sullivan’s oratorios and much\r\nlonger than the first, was written for the Birmingham Festival and\r\nperformed there on August 27, 1873. The composer’s plan is set forth in\r\nthe preface as follows: ‘The work has been laid out in scenes dealing\r\nrespectively, in the first part, with the nativity, preaching, healing\r\nand prophesying of our Lord, ending with the triumphal entry into\r\nJerusalem; and in the second part with the utterances which, containing\r\nthe avowal of himself as the Son of Man, excited to the utmost the\r\nwrath of his enemies, and led the rulers to conspire for his betrayal\r\nand death; the solemn recital by the chorus of his sufferings, and\r\nthe belief in his final reward; the grief of Mary Magdalene at the\r\nsepulchre; and the consolation and triumph of the disciples at the\r\nresurrection of their Lord and Master.’\r\n\r\nThe first part is divided into four scenes--‘Bethlehem,’ ‘Nazareth,’\r\n‘Lazarus’ and ‘The Way to Jerusalem.’ The second part contains\r\ntwo--‘Jerusalem’ and ‘At the Sepulchre.’ The first scene, dealing\r\nwith the narrative of the shepherds, the announcement by the angel\r\nand the Magnificat sung by Mary, is introduced by a pastoral prelude\r\nwhich establishes the atmosphere of the scene. In the second scene,\r\n‘Nazareth,’ are two very dramatic choruses, ‘Whence hath this man\r\nhis wisdom?’ and ‘Is not this Jesus?’ It contains also an effective\r\nquintet, ‘Doubtless thou art our Father,’ and a well-written chorus,\r\n‘He maketh the sun to rise,’ which is one of the finest in the\r\nwork. The ‘Lazarus’ scene is darksome throughout, while ‘The Way to\r\nJerusalem,’ strongly contrasted with the preceding, is festive in\r\ncharacter and contains a beautiful three-part chorus for children’s\r\nvoices, ‘Hosanna to the Son of David.’ The first part closes with a\r\nmassive ‘Hosanna’ chorus combined with a trio for female solo voices.\r\nThe anger and dissension caused by the Lord’s sojourn in Jerusalem are\r\ndramatically depicted in an introduction which opens the second part\r\nand which is followed by an expressive baritone solo, ‘When the Son of\r\nMan shall come.’ This scene also contains a charming chorus for women’s\r\nvoices, ‘The hour is come,’ and the expressive farewell of Jesus,\r\n‘Daughters of Jerusalem.’ The crucifixion is not brought into the work\r\nexcept by indirect mention in a chorus and the work closes with the\r\nscene ‘At the Sepulchre,’ in which an angel tells the waiting Mary\r\nMagdalene that Christ has risen. This leads, after a tenor solo, to the\r\nfinal fugal chorus, ‘Him hath God exalted.’\r\n\r\nFrederic Hymen Cowen (born 1852) wrote two oratorios that fall within\r\nthis period--‘The Deluge’ (1878), and ‘Ruth,’ written for the Worcester\r\nFestival of 1887. The incidents of the familiar story of ‘Ruth’\r\n(here called a dramatic oratorio) are grouped into two parts by the\r\nlibrettist, Joseph Bennett, and the composer has given throughout a\r\npleasing, though not deep, musical setting to the text.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                   VII\r\n\r\nOratorio by native American composers is a very young product and\r\npractically dates from the composition of Paine’s ‘St. Peter,’ though\r\nseveral works with the title of oratorio had been written before this.\r\nPaine, however, was the first American to approach his task with an\r\nadequate equipment of ripe musicianship and knowledge of technical\r\nmeans of expression. As yet he has been followed in this field by\r\ncomparatively few American composers, though many worthy works in\r\ncantata-form have been written.\r\n\r\n‘St. Peter,’ by John K. Paine (1839-1906), received its first\r\nperformance in Portland, Maine, in June, 1873, under the direction of\r\nthe composer. Its second performance took place in Boston on May 9,\r\n1874, by the Handel and Haydn Society. The main theme of the oratorio\r\nis the establishment of Christianity, as illustrated by the four\r\nmain events in the life of St. Peter. It consists of two parts--(1)\r\nThe Divine Call, followed by the denial of Peter and his repentance,\r\nand (2) The Ascension and Pentecost. The work abounds in strong,\r\nwell-written choruses and beautiful arias, which, where the text\r\ndemands it, become at times touching (as, for example, in the aria,\r\n‘Let not your hearts be troubled’) and at times dramatic, as is the\r\nscene of the emphatic denials of Peter and the accusations of the\r\npeople. A noble chorus, ‘Awake, thou that sleepest,’ closes the first\r\npart. Probably the most beautiful choral number, however, is in the\r\nsecond part, ‘The voice of the Lord,’ which follows the description of\r\nthe Pentecostal miracle; though it is not massive, as is the majestic\r\nclosing chorus, ‘Great and marvellous are Thy works.’\r\n\r\nHoratio Parker’s _Hora Novissima_, the most ambitious and finely\r\nconceived choral work by an American, was written in 1892, while the\r\ncomposer was associated with Dvořák as teacher of counterpoint in the\r\nNational Conservatory of Music in New York, and received its first\r\nhearing on May 3, 1893, when it was given by the Church Choral Society\r\nof New York under the direction of the composer. Soon after it was\r\ngiven in Boston and at the Festivals of Cincinnati and Worcester,\r\nMass. In 1899 it was the chief novelty at the Three Choirs Festival\r\nin Worcester, England (also conducted by the composer), and bears the\r\ndistinction of being the first work of an American to be performed\r\nunder these historic auspices.\r\n\r\nThe subject of the oratorio deals with the New Jerusalem and the\r\ntext, selected from a Latin poem of the twelfth century by the monk\r\nBernard de Morlaix entitled ‘The Rhythm of the Celestial Country,’ has\r\nbeen most skillfully translated by the composer’s mother, Isabella G.\r\nParker. The oratorio consists of eleven numbers grouped into two parts,\r\nand the larger portion of it is choral, there being only four numbers\r\nfor solo voices. The opening chorus, following the instrumental prelude\r\nin which the principal motives are set forth, begins with the words,\r\n_Hora novissima_ (‘Cometh earth’s latest hour’), which at once reveals\r\nthe composer’s dignified style of choral writing. The most effective\r\nportion of the first part, however, is the fugal chorus. _Pars mea,\r\nrex meus_ (‘Most Mighty, most Holy’), which is built up on massive\r\nlines. Another very broad and truly splendid number is the joyous\r\ndouble chorus, _Stant Syon atria_ (‘There stand those walls on high’),\r\nwhich is in the second part. An _a cappella_ chorus, _Urbs Syon unica_\r\n(‘City of high renown’), is finely developed in strict fugal form and\r\nleads over into the final number--broad and again fugally treated--for\r\nquartet and chorus, _Urbs Syon inclyta_ (‘Thou city great and high’),\r\nwhich forms a majestic close to a noble work, conceived on broad lines\r\nand constructed with conspicuous skill and scholarship. Among the solo\r\nportions the lovely soprano aria, _O bone patria_ (‘O country, bright\r\nand fair’), is especially distinguished by graceful, dignified and\r\nappealing melody.\r\n\r\n‘The Legend of St. Christopher,’ a dramatic oratorio on a theme that\r\nhas often been chosen by composers, was written soon after the _Hora\r\nNovissima_ and was published in 1898. In September, 1902, Parker\r\nconducted the third part of this oratorio at the Worcester (England)\r\nFestival and in October of the same year the entire work was performed\r\nat the Bristol Festival. The text, as in the case of many of the\r\ncomposer’s choral works, is by his mother, Isabella G. Parker. It\r\npresents in attractive poetic form the main features of the familiar\r\nlegend and requires the following characters: Offerus, the King, the\r\nQueen, the Hermit and Satan. The chorus frequently assumes the burden\r\nof narration. The legend relates how the giant Offerus sought the\r\nmightiest earthly monarch, that he might serve him with his great\r\nstrength and stature. But he finds that the king to whom he attaches\r\nhimself is not the mightiest on earth, for he fears Satan, whom the\r\ngiant straightway seeks to serve. Satan in turn trembles as they pass\r\na cross by the roadside before which women are singing a hymn to the\r\nLord of Heaven. Offerus finally finds a hermit who serves this Lord of\r\nHeaven and who teaches him the meaning of service. During a furious\r\nstorm at night a child with a quiet light upon its head piteously begs\r\nto be carried across the raging stream. Offerus heeds the cry and\r\ncarries the child in his strong arms, only to find, when he reaches\r\nthe further shore, that it was the Christ-child he bore; the hermit\r\nexclaims ‘Christopher be now thy name, thine henceforth by rightful\r\nclaim.’\r\n\r\nThe musical handling of the theme shows the composer’s marked skill\r\nand preference for choral-writing. The choral portions of the work\r\nare the strongest, though there are not wanting lyric solo-passages\r\nof great beauty, as witness the melodies assigned to the Queen and\r\nthe Hermit, and the fine trio in the last part (an Angel, the Hermit\r\nand Offerus). It would be difficult to find among modern works a more\r\nexquisite piece of effective unaccompanied part-writing than Parker has\r\ngiven in his setting of the Latin hymn, _Jam sol recedit igneus_, which\r\nfollows immediately after the above trio.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                               CHAPTER X\r\n\r\n                            THE MODERN MASS\r\n\r\n     The adaptation of liturgical forms to extra-liturgical\r\n     purposes; Mass; Requiem Mass--Stabat Mater; Magnificat; Te\r\n     Deum--Musical masses and the Roman service--Bach: ‘B minor\r\n     Mass’--Bach’s ‘Magnificat in D’; Pergolesi’s _Stabat Mater_;\r\n     Handel’s Te Deums; Graun’s ‘Prague Te Deum’; Haydn’s church\r\n     music--Mozart: the _Requiem_ and other masses--Cherubini:\r\n     _Requiem_ and other masses; Schubert’s masses--Beethoven:\r\n     _Missa Solemnis_; Weber’s masses--Berlioz: _Requiem_; _Te\r\n     Deum_; Rossini’s _Stabat Mater_; Liszt: ‘Graner Mass’ and\r\n     ‘Hungarian Coronation Mass’--Gounod: ‘St. Cecilia Mass’ and\r\n     other masses; Dvořák: _Requiem_ and _Stabat Mater_; Verdi:\r\n     ‘The Manzoni Requiem’--The masses of Rheinberger, Henschel\r\n     and others.\r\n\r\n\r\nAs polyphonic music developed with the expanding possibilities of the\r\ncontrapuntal art and the increasing splendor of the Roman liturgical\r\nservice, the old church composers seized upon certain portions of\r\nthe liturgy as being especially adapted for musical exploitation\r\nand elaboration. The masters of the fifteenth and sixteenth century\r\necclesiastical vocal counterpoint made the musical settings of these\r\nparts of the holy office the object of their deepest consideration\r\nand lavished on them their utmost artistic skill and profundity. The\r\nparts of the holy office thus selected were those that were constant,\r\ninvariable from day to day; they were six in number and in the\r\nfollowing order: _Kyrie_ (in three parts, _Kyrie eleison!_ _Christe\r\neleison!_ _Kyrie eleison!_), _Gloria_ (Doxology), _Credo_, _Sanctus_,\r\n_Benedictus_ and _Agnus Dei_. Since these were the principal musical\r\nportions of the eucharistic office sung by the choir, they came to be\r\nspoken of together as one composition, as Palestrina’s ‘Mass of Pope\r\nMarcellus,’ Gounod’s ‘St. Cecilia Mass,’ and so on. In all musical\r\nmasses, ancient or modern, the same number and order of movements is\r\npreserved, since the holy office itself is universal and unchangeable.\r\nWith the development of instrumental music in the seventeenth and\r\neighteenth centuries, opportunities were offered for combining various\r\ninstruments with the voices, and the mass with orchestral accompaniment\r\narose. When sacred music finally broke loose from ecclesiastical\r\ncontrol and came to be considered independent of the Church, composers\r\ntook advantage of the great poetic suggestiveness of the missal text\r\nfor constructing elaborate choral works with the combined resources of\r\ninstruments and voices. While many of the modern masses here considered\r\nwere written as liturgical music for actual church performance,\r\nmany must be considered apart from any ecclesiastical use, as pure\r\nconcert-music. The most prominent of these are probably Bach’s great ‘B\r\nminor Mass’ and Beethoven’s ‘Mass in D.’\r\n\r\nAmong the liturgical forms that have been most employed for\r\nextra-liturgical purposes as concert-music are the mass (_Missa\r\nSolemnis_, consisting of the six numbers given above), the _Requiem_\r\n(_Missa pro Defunctis_), _Stabat Mater_, _Te Deum_ and _Magnificat_.\r\nThese great religious poems of the Middle Ages and earlier, which were\r\neither adopted into or were associated with the liturgy of the Roman\r\nChurch, have never ceased to stir the imagination of composers, some\r\nof whom have been of the Protestant faith. The Protestant Church did\r\nnot adopt the Mass into its liturgy, though the early Lutheran Church\r\nborrowed a modified form from the Roman Church and the Anglican Church\r\nstill retains many of the same musical texts (such as the Gloria, Te\r\nDeum, Benedictus, and others) that were used in various parts of the\r\nRoman service. The _Kyrie_ and _Gloria_ were formerly frequently used\r\ntogether in the Lutheran service as the so-called short mass (_Missa\r\nbrevis_).\r\n\r\nThe Requiem Mass (_Missa pro Defunctis_) takes its name from the\r\nbeginning of the Introit, _Requiem æternam dona eis, Domine_, and\r\nconsists of the holy office celebrated in memory of the departed.\r\nIt may take place any day before burial, especially the third, or\r\non the seventh or the thirtieth day after death, or on the first or\r\nany subsequent anniversary of the death. It is also celebrated on\r\nAll Souls’ Day, November 2, in memory of all the faithful departed.\r\nAs a form of musical composition, the Requiem consists of nine\r\nparts: (1) The Introit--_Requiem æternam_; (2) _Kyrie_; (3) the\r\nGradual and Tract--_Requiem æternam_ and _Absolve, Domine_; (4) The\r\nSequence or Prose--_Dies iræ_; (5) The Offertorium--_Domine Jesu\r\nChristi_; (6) _Sanctus_; (7) _Benedictus_; (8) _Agnus Dei_; and\r\n(9) the Communio--_Lux æterna_. In addition to these the following\r\nare sometimes added: (10) Responsorium--_Libera me_; and (11) the\r\nLectio--_Tædet animam meam_.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                   I\r\n\r\nThe _Stabat Mater_ is a beautiful mediæval poem, whose authorship is\r\ngenerally ascribed to a Franciscan monk, Jacobus de Benedictis, though\r\nsome believe it to have been written by Pope Innocent III and still\r\nothers by St. Bonaventure. It was not a part of the liturgy and was\r\nnot at first used with music. It did not come into any large use as a\r\ndevotional poem until about the thirteenth century and gradually found\r\nits way into the liturgy as a ‘sequence,’ though it did not even appear\r\nin the Roman Missal until 1727, and was not sanctioned as a hymn until\r\nsome time after that. It is one of the finest and most popular of the\r\nold Latin poems and has lent itself so well to musical setting that\r\nmany composers from Des Prés to Rossini have been inspired to set it.\r\nIt depicts the sorrowing mother, Mary, as she stood at the foot of the\r\ncross and the desire of humanity to share with her this sorrow. The\r\ninitial words of the poem are\r\n\r\n      _Stabat mater dolorosa\r\n      Juxta crucem lacrymosa_,\r\n\r\na free translation of which is--‘The weeping, mournful mother stood\r\nclose to the cross.’\r\n\r\nThe _Magnificat_ is the Song of the Blessed Mary, _Magnificat anima\r\nmea Dominum_ (‘My soul doth magnify the Lord’), and appears as the\r\ncentral point of musical interest in the Vesper service. During the\r\nperiod of the exclusively vocal service, it was sung antiphonally,\r\nsometimes as a plain-song melody, with choral response in several\r\nvoices. In the second half of the sixteenth century, however, this was\r\ndiscontinued and only the first versicle was intoned by one voice,\r\nand the other eleven were sung by the choir. This was finally changed\r\ninto the antiphonal singing of two choirs. With the development of the\r\norgan, this instrument began to take a place in alternating with the\r\nvoices, giving a different antiphonal effect. Thus from the sixteenth\r\nto the eighteenth century we find many so-called ‘Organ Magnificats.’\r\nLater a deterioration began by combining the plain-song with secular or\r\nirrelevant matter, and this custom gradually led to the substitution of\r\na good secular melody as a _cantus_, in place of the plain-song chant.\r\nIn this style Orlandus Lassus produced some of the most charming _a\r\ncappella_ compositions extant. In the Anglican Church, the Magnificat\r\nalso assumed free and elaborate proportions and it consists of combined\r\nsolo and chorus passages with organ and, sometimes, orchestral\r\naccompaniment. Bach, Mendelssohn and other modern composers have\r\ntreated the Magnificat in elaborate oratorio style with orchestral\r\naccompaniment and complex voice-writing.\r\n\r\nThe _Te Deum Laudamus_ (‘We praise Thee, O God’) seems to owe its\r\norigin to Nicetas, Bishop of Remesiana in Dacia (about A. D. 400), and\r\nit was at once used as an important part of the Nocturns or Matins.\r\nMusic was used with it from the beginning, in fact the words were used\r\nwith chants already existent. It is in three parts or sections. The\r\npraise of the Trinity occupies all of the first section; ‘Thou art the\r\nKing of Glory’ begins the second section, which ends with two verses\r\nof prayer, ‘We therefore pray Thee’ and ‘Make them to be numbered.’\r\nThe third section begins with ‘O Lord, save Thy people and bless Thine\r\nheritage.’ It was at first sung to a free chant but was later developed\r\ninto complex settings for solos, chorus and elaborate accompaniment.\r\nWhile it is a part of the service of both the Roman and the Anglican\r\nChurches, the finest examples of this great canticle seem to come from\r\nEngland, that by Purcell, written for St. Cecilia’s Day, 1694, and\r\npublished in 1697, being one of the earliest large ones, and indeed one\r\nof the greatest Te Deums. This was doubtless the model for Handel’s\r\n‘Utrecht Te Deum,’ written in 1712, which is even a nobler work than\r\nthat by Purcell. These, together with the ones of Macfarren and\r\nSullivan, that of Dvořák in 1896, Stanford’s, performed at the Leeds\r\nFestival in 1898, and Parry’s, performed at the Hereford Festival of\r\n1900, are the most famous Te Deums of modern times.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                   II\r\n\r\nThe decadence in church-music that began to set in early in the\r\nseventeenth century and that soon caused the glories of the ‘Palestrina\r\nstyle’ to disappear, may be traced, not so much to the monodic\r\nrevolution and the consequent change in the style of writing it\r\nentailed, but primarily to the fact that the composers of church music\r\nin the main wrote at the same time for church and theatre. Blinded\r\nby the greater brilliance of the stage, they were not able to keep\r\nseparate these two widely divergent styles and the operatic mode of\r\nspeech soon found entrance into the church service, and later there was\r\nvery little to distinguish the one style from the other. This condition\r\ncontinued uninterrupted until the movement for the restoration of\r\nCatholic Church music was started near the middle of the nineteenth\r\ncentury by Kaspar Ett (1788-1847) and Karl Proske (1794-1861), and\r\nfurther developed by Franz Witt (1834-1888) and the Cecilian Society.\r\n\r\nBefore this period of reform set in (and it is by no means carried\r\nto full fruition as yet) a few great composers wrote masses of solid\r\nmusical worth for the Roman Church service, though seldom in the real\r\nspirit of the liturgy. Haydn wrote 13 masses and much other church\r\nmusic, but we miss the ecclesiastical note in his bright, sunny music.\r\nMozart composed the great Requiem, 15 masses, 4 Kyries, 9 Offertories,\r\na Te Deum, and other pieces. But of his church music, Dr. Heinrich\r\nReimann, in a criticism of Jahn’s ‘Life of Mozart’ says: ‘His masses\r\nare unequal in value, but even the best are, in spite of manifold\r\nexcellences in other respects, so narrowly conceived, so entirely\r\nadapted, not merely to certain local conditions, but also to the taste\r\nof individual clerical dignitaries and general convention, that the\r\ncomposer who otherwise knew so well how to fit the tone to the word,\r\nhere often appears thoughtless, so little does he trouble to render the\r\nmeaning of the text in his music.’ Franz Witt, certainly a competent\r\nauthority from the standpoint of their adaptability to the Roman\r\nservice, rather severely says: ‘Whoever desires to serve Art (where\r\ninstrumental music is in use), let him perform Mozart’s 8th and 9th\r\nMasses (in F and D, Köchel Nos. 192 and 194) and let him disregard\r\n_all_ the rest!’ From the same standpoint, Dr. Karl Weinmann, in his\r\n‘History of Church Music’ (p. 192), judges Beethoven’s two Masses in\r\nC and D as too secular and extravagant in expression for the church\r\nservice and adds (p. 193): ‘Whoever has penetrated deeper into the\r\nspirit of the Catholic liturgy, within whose framework the performance\r\nmust after all take place, will see that between the seriousness of\r\nthe liturgic act and the gaiety of these compositions (of Mozart,\r\nHaydn, and Beethoven), an abyss yawns which is not to be bridged!’\r\nCherubini’s masses, of which we possess eleven, likewise come under the\r\ncondemnation of being un-ecclesiastical in character, notwithstanding\r\nall their inherent qualities of nobility and dignity as sacred music.\r\nAnd here again we encounter the distinction, to which attention has\r\nbeen called in an earlier chapter, between church-music and religious\r\nmusic.\r\n\r\nAmong the earlier composers whose music was well adapted to the Roman\r\nservice, Dr. Weinmann mentions Michael Haydn (1737-1806), brother\r\nof Joseph, as the one who ‘approached perhaps most nearly to the\r\nrequirements of church art, at least in his works written without an\r\norchestra, of which the _Tenebræ_ and the two _Missæ Quadragesimales_\r\nare the most famous.’ Under the influence of the Cecilian Society\r\nmovement, Catholic composers, such as Moritz Brosig (1815-1887) and\r\nJoseph Rheinberger (1839-1901), have made noteworthy contributions to a\r\nregenerated church-art.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                   III\r\n\r\nPossibly the finest illustration of the essential difference between\r\nchurch-music and religious music is to be found in Bach’s incomparable\r\nB minor Mass. It is church-music in no sense of the word, for it was\r\nwritten without any reference to the liturgic significance of the\r\ntext or to the fitness of the music for church service, and it has\r\nnever been used as real liturgic music. It is the expression of Bach’s\r\nindividual conception of the tremendous religious meaning of the\r\nwords, expressed in musical terms that are wholly emancipated from all\r\necclesiastical restraint or ritualistic consideration. Though he used\r\nthe same words that are found in the Roman Mass, Bach, as a devout\r\nLutheran, was wholly out of sympathy with the Roman service itself, of\r\nwhich these words form so vital a part. And yet as a piece of religious\r\nmusic, it probably has no equal among choral masterpieces, unless it be\r\nBeethoven’s ‘Mass in D.’ It touches the most exalted religious emotions\r\nand voices the common spiritual hopes and aspirations of humanity; it\r\nis religious music, but it is non-sectarian.\r\n\r\nThis colossal work was written between 1733 and 1738, the _Kyrie_\r\nand the _Gloria_ having been completed in 1733 and the other parts\r\nby 1738. The work was conceived on stupendous lines which outclassed\r\nany previous effort either of his own or of any other composer of\r\nmasses. Bach gave one or two parts of this mass now and then at some\r\nof the regular services at Leipzig and these occupied as much time as\r\ncould be allotted to the musical portion of the service, for, indeed,\r\nin this work each portion had in itself the dimensions of a cantata.\r\nUnimportant texts were developed into large arias or complicated fugal\r\nchoruses, and the variety and abundance of musical material used is\r\nincredible.\r\n\r\nEntirely apart from its complexity, stands the fact that Bach’s\r\nmusical structure is most expressive, and even if the hearer loses a\r\nword here and there, he cannot fail to catch the spirit, especially in\r\nsuch passages as the joyous _Gloria_ and the calm _Et in terra pax_. It\r\nis true that Bach’s works, in his own time as now, required a somewhat\r\ntrained listener, but his themes are so characteristic of the verbal\r\nideas expressed in the text that they are in themselves an eloquent,\r\nyet simple, commentary on it. The _Kyrie_ alone consists of three\r\nelaborate parts, the first of which ends in a five-part fugal chorus.\r\nThe second part, _Christe eleison_, is a duet sung by two sopranos.\r\nIt has a simple, childlike quality of entreaty and is followed by the\r\nthird part, _Kyrie eleison_, again fugally treated in four parts. The\r\nfollowing number, the _Gloria_, which, with the _Credo_, stands at the\r\nsummit of choral-writing, consists of eight musically complete parts,\r\nthe last of which, _Cum sancto spiritu_, written for five-part chorus,\r\nis one of the most powerful and exalted of the entire work. The _Credo_\r\nis set on the same vast lines as the _Gloria_. Beginning with a theme\r\ntaken from a Gregorian chorale, the composer develops it fugally after\r\nit has been announced by tenors, basses and altos. The _Credo_ also\r\nconsists of eight parts, the choral first part being followed by a most\r\nelaborate soprano and alto duet (_Et in unum Dominum_), after which\r\nfollows the five-part fugal chorus (_Et incarnatus_). The _Crucifixus_\r\nis one of the most remarkable portions of the entire work. The bass\r\ntheme, appearing thirteen times in succession, gives a remarkable\r\nbackground, and with the other choral parts, which move freely over it,\r\ncreates an atmosphere of mingled pain, sorrow and consecration. _Et\r\nresurrexit_ is taken up by the five-part fugal chorus, which is full\r\nof joy. _Et in spiritum sanctum_ is a bass aria introduced by the oboe\r\nd’amour and the _Confiteor unum baptisma_ closes this group with an\r\nintricate five-part double fugue. The _Sanctus_ is a massive six-part\r\nchorus, the _Osanna_ is an eight-part chorus, the _Benedictus_ is a\r\ntenor solo with violin obbligato, and the _Agnus Dei_ an alto solo. The\r\nlast chorus (_Dona nobis pacem_) is in four parts and this brings this\r\nmonumental work to a close. Its great difficulty has militated against\r\nits being as frequently performed as it certainly merits. Complete\r\nperformances of it have been given at intervals since its complete\r\nproduction at the Berlin Singakademie in 1835. Its first performance in\r\nAmerica was the one given at Bethlehem, Pennsylvania, in 1900, at the\r\nBach Festival under direction of J. Frederick Wolle.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                   IV\r\n\r\nBach’s ‘Magnificat in D.’--The first performance of this great work\r\n(called the ‘Great Magnificat’) was given on Christmas, 1723, at the\r\nevening service in the Thomas Church at Leipzig. It is characterized\r\nby powerful choruses which are elaborated with all of Bach’s technical\r\nresources. It calls for a five-part chorus with accompaniment of organ\r\nand orchestra and, in its feeling of largeness, foreshadows the future\r\nwork of this wonderful genius.\r\n\r\nThe _Stabat Mater_ of Pergolesi (1710-1736) is supposed to have been\r\nwritten at Pozzuoli, where he went in 1736 because of ill health, and\r\nat the request of the Brotherhood of Saint Luigi de Palazzo to replace\r\nthe work of A. Scarlatti which had been performed there regularly on\r\nGood Friday. Some writers, however, think it was written much earlier,\r\nin fact, soon after leaving the Conservatory at Naples in 1729. The\r\ndate 1736, however, seems the more authentic and it is likely that he\r\nwrote it while living in the monastery at Pozzuoli, where, however,\r\nhe did not devote himself by any means wholly to sacred writing, but\r\nto his favorite _opera buffa_ as well. While the work is not rich in\r\nlarge ideas--rather is it made up of many short though melodious themes\r\nwhich, like all of Pergolesi’s, border on the sentimental--it has\r\nalways held a high place in Italy.\r\n\r\nHandel’s Te Deums.--The _Utrecht Te Deum_, written in 1712 to\r\ncelebrate the signing of the peace of Utrecht, was avowedly composed\r\nin the same form as Purcell’s, though Handel’s work was characterized\r\nby greater brilliancy, especially in the orchestral coloring. The work\r\nantagonized his patron, the Grand Duke of Hanover, whose affairs were\r\nby no means furthered by the council of Utrecht, and it therefore\r\nrecalls a rather dark hour in Handel’s history. The _Dettingen Te\r\nDeum_, on the contrary, brought outwardly more gratifying results. The\r\nunexpected victory of George II over the French at Dettingen brought\r\ngreat joy and gratitude to the English people and Handel, who then\r\nwas at the Chapel Royal, was requested to write a Te Deum for the\r\nthanksgiving service to be held Nov. 27, 1743, in St. James’s Chapel.\r\nIt was begun July 17th and completed some time before the 30th of that\r\nmonth. The work is rated as one of the greatest by this composer and\r\nthe joy and thanksgiving of the whole nation is depicted in a style\r\nthat is more grandioso, but less rich in contrapuntal resources, than\r\nthe _Utrecht Te Deum_. He achieved his massive effects, not through any\r\ntheatrical means, but by combining the note of triumph and exultant\r\njoy with a measured dignity, the effect of which is most compelling.\r\nThe fanfare of trumpets and drums which ushers in the opening chorus\r\nhas never been surpassed in its magnificence for the expression of\r\nthanksgiving.\r\n\r\nGraun’s ‘Prague Te Deum.’--Though he had written some very acceptable\r\nmusic for church service while a mere boy, Graun (1701-1759) achieved\r\nhis first fame as a composer of operas. This led to his appointment as\r\nchapel-master to Frederick the Great, and not long before his death he\r\nwrote two sacred works which have established his permanent fame, the\r\n‘Passion’ and the so-called _Prague Te Deum_. The latter was written\r\nto commemorate his royal patron’s victory at Prague in 1756, but was\r\nnot performed until 1762 at Charlottenburg, at the close of the Seven\r\nYears’ War. It was, therefore, really performed as a peace celebration.\r\nIt is one of the finest Te Deums in existence and certainly the most\r\ncelebrated of Continental settings.\r\n\r\nThe first important work that proclaimed Joseph Haydn a vocal writer\r\nwas the _Stabat Mater_, written in 1771. It follows the prevalent\r\nItalian style and reminds somewhat of Pergolesi, with only a few\r\nsuggestions of the Haydn that was revealed in the ‘Creation.’ The\r\nsecond of his two Te Deums (written in 1800) is a noble composition\r\nwhich is still much used in church service. Though Haydn’s masses (he\r\nwrote thirteen) are not conceived in the real spirit of the Roman\r\nliturgy and are lacking in dignity and austerity, they are still among\r\nthe most frequently used by German Catholic choirs. The freshness and\r\ncheerfulness which pervade his church as well as his secular music\r\ncannot be attributed to lack of seriousness on Haydn’s part, but rather\r\nto fundamental traits of character which looked at God and His whole\r\nuniverse through eyes that saw only joy and hope. He is said to have\r\nconfided to his friend Carpani that at the thought of God his heart\r\nleaped for joy, and he could not help his music doing the same. Among\r\nthe most famous of his masses are No. 2 in C (the numbering follows\r\nthe Novello edition); the _Paukenmesse_ (_in tempore belli_); No. 3 in\r\nD, the ‘Imperial’; No. 4 in B-flat, ‘The Creation’; and the _Theresien\r\nMesse_ in B-flat.\r\n\r\nHermann Kretzschmar[81] says that ‘between Mozart’s last mass and his\r\n\"Requiem\" there lies a whole lifetime,’ and indeed this noble work, the\r\ncompletion of which was cut off by the master’s death, is considered\r\none of the great choral compositions of all time. Doubtless its wide\r\nappeal is due somewhat to the pathetic and romantic circumstances\r\nsurrounding the period of its composition. One never thinks of it\r\nwithout recalling the mysterious, long black figure of the stranger\r\nwho commissioned Mozart to write it, and the apprehension of the sick\r\nand discouraged composer and his pathetic desire to live to see its\r\ncompletion. The mysterious stranger was later revealed as Count Franz\r\nvon Walsegg of Ruppach, who was possessed with the idea of posing as a\r\ncomposer and who desired to perform a Requiem in memory of his wife who\r\nhad died a short time before. It was his plan, which he later carried\r\nout, to let this Requiem be known as his own. Mozart died on Dec. 5,\r\n1791, before completing this work, which occupied his thoughts up to\r\nhis last conscious moments. His widow, who was most anxious to have the\r\n‘Requiem’ ready for delivery on the day that it was due, commissioned\r\nSüssmayer to complete the work. Süssmayer was a composer of some\r\nrepute and, as a close friend and a pupil of Mozart, was intimately\r\nacquainted with the composer’s ideas regarding the ‘Requiem’; then,\r\ntoo, his handwriting was so much like Mozart’s that the widow was the\r\nmore ready to entrust the completion of the task to him, since he could\r\npreserve the external resemblance to the fragments. So successful was\r\nSüssmayer in writing in his master’s style that for many years the\r\n_Benedictus_, which was entirely his own work, was considered the gem\r\nof the whole. The parts that were written in Mozart’s own hand were the\r\n_Requiem_ and the _Kyrie_ complete, the voice parts, organ and part of\r\nthe accompaniment of _Dies iræ_ (68 measures); _Tuba mirum_ (62); _Rex\r\ntremendæ_ (22); _Recordare_ (130); _Confutatis_ (40); _Lacrymosa_ (8);\r\n_Domine_ (78); and _Hostias_ (54).\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Mozart rehearsing his Requiem (shortly before his death)]\r\n                      _Painting by Munkacsy_\r\n\r\n\r\nThis work, when completed and delivered to Count von Walsegg, was\r\ncopied by him and performed as his own on Dec. 14, 1793, but after\r\nmany years the manuscript, as turned over by Süssmayer, was found\r\nand placed in the _Hofbibliothek_ in Vienna. That Mozart strove to\r\nemphasize the churchly character in his ‘Requiem’ is particularly in\r\nevidence in the Introit (_Requiem æternam_), also in his use of the\r\nGregorian chorale and in the simplicity of his themes. The picturing\r\nof the approach of the Day of Judgment (_Dies iræ_) is dramatic and\r\nreveals a heaviness which is further augmented by the restlessness\r\nof the orchestra; notwithstanding this, however, Mozart introduces\r\na spirit of resignation and the whole passage becomes peaceful and\r\nexpressive. The _Kyrie_ is a beautiful, ornate double fugue developed\r\nfrom the two themes to which the words _Kyrie eleison_ and _Christe\r\neleison_ are set. The _Rex tremendæ_ is another example of elaborate\r\nas well as effective contrapuntal writing--here in four-voiced canon\r\nform. Its close is delicately contrasted with the body of the movement\r\nby the introduction of the prayer, _Salva me, fons pietatis_. The\r\n_Recordare_, sung by a quartet of solo voices with an independent fugal\r\naccompaniment, is one of the most exquisite portions of the work and\r\nby many is considered the finest. It is rich in beautiful melodies and\r\nis worked out in most delicate detail. The touching _Confutatis_, sung\r\nantiphonally by men’s and women’s voices, is another effective portion\r\nof this great work, which Jahn speaks of as ‘the true and legitimate\r\nexpression of his (Mozart’s) artistic nature at its highest point of\r\nfinish--his imperishable monument.’\r\n\r\nMasses.--Mozart had mastered this form of composition, according to\r\nthe standards of the time, while still a mere boy; but probably his\r\nbest mass, the one ranking closest to the ‘Requiem,’ is the sixth,\r\nthe Mass in F, which is very contrapuntal and contains some masterly\r\nwriting. In the _Credo_ of this mass he used material from the\r\n‘Jupiter’ Symphony, as he did also in the _Sanctus_ of the B-flat or\r\n‘Credo’ Mass. The Mass in D is a close second to the one in F above\r\nmentioned and in these two he expressed himself freely, while in the\r\nfollowing five, which are unfortunately his best known, he was obliged\r\nto write more artificially in order to satisfy his display-loving\r\npatron, the Archbishop of Salzburg.\r\n\r\nMost of the sixteen masses in the Breitkopf and Härtel complete edition\r\nof Mozart’s works are supposed to have been youthful compositions,\r\nwhich, though suggestive of other works of the master, fall far short\r\nof his usual skill. According to Köchel, however, the masses published\r\nby Novello are not all genuine; such are those in E-flat (Novello, Nos.\r\n13 and 16), and in C (No. 17). Jahn and Köchel both agree in believing\r\nthat the one in B-flat (No. 7, Novello, but published originally by\r\nPeters) is not Mozart’s and base their contention not only on the use\r\nof the clarinets, which were not present in his Salzburg orchestra,\r\nbut on the fact that Mozart’s widow credited Süssmayer with being the\r\ncomposer of the work. Other doubtful ones are two short masses in C\r\nand G (Novello, Nos. 8 and 9), one in G (Novello, No. 12) and a short\r\nRequiem in D minor which Köchel discards because of his certainty that\r\nMozart never wrote but one Requiem, his last, unfinished work.\r\n\r\nThe fact that Mozart’s compositions were circulated mostly in\r\nmanuscript form and that few of them were published during his\r\nlifetime, may be largely responsible for the error of attributing these\r\nmasses to him and composers of small attainments may have used this\r\nmeans for getting a hearing for their works. A Mass in C, known as the\r\n‘Coronation Mass’ (why this name, is not known) was evidently patched\r\ntogether from his opera _Cosi fan tutte_, though some authorities\r\nbelieve that he himself compiled the opera from the mass. The\r\nincomplete Mass in C minor is known to be genuine, though he afterwards\r\nused a large part of it in his _Davidde penitente_. This mass was begun\r\nin 1782 and was intended for performance as a sort of thank-offering\r\nupon his marriage to Constance Weber and it had one performance on\r\nAug. 25, 1783, in St. Peter’s Church, Salzburg. He did not complete\r\nit for the ceremony, however, and the missing numbers were supplied\r\nby him with material from his other works. The work is uneven in\r\nquality, some of it being very immature and almost trivial, while other\r\nparts, such as the _Kyrie_ and _Gratias_, do not fall far below the\r\n‘Requiem.’ Aloys Schmitt endeavored to complete the work in order to\r\nmake it available for church-service. As the _Agnus Dei_ was missing,\r\nhe repeated the music of the _Kyrie_ and, to complete the unfinished\r\n_Credo_, he inserted unfamiliar sacred compositions of Mozart’s, thus\r\nusing the composer’s own material and inserting his own harmonies, here\r\nand there, merely to connect the parts.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                   V\r\n\r\nCherubini’s Requiem Mass in C minor was composed in 1816 at the request\r\nof Louis XVIII for a memorial service for Louis XVI, but it did not\r\ngain much more than passing recognition until it was again performed\r\nat the funeral service of Méhul in 1818. It was by all means the best\r\nRequiem Mass produced in France in many years and one which deserved\r\nnot merely local but general recognition. The work is soulful and\r\nexpressive, though Cherubini was restrained in his utterance. He was\r\ngiven to using short, simple themes, which, however, are not only\r\nbeautiful, but artistically expressive. The general tone of the work\r\nis gloomy and sadly resigned, dwelling on the thought of death as\r\nman’s inevitable destiny. The first ray of hope or light comes with\r\nthe words--_ad te omnis caro veniet_, but on the whole the dark tints\r\nprevail throughout this masterful and artistic work and give it a\r\npeculiar force which few other ‘masses for the dead’ have attained.\r\n\r\nCherubini’s second _Requiem_ in D minor, written in 1836, though not\r\nunlike the first both as to musical material and coloring, is a far\r\nless important work. The fact that it was written entirely for male\r\nvoices makes it somewhat individual in character, but although numerous\r\nRequiems have appeared for male voices, they are no longer performed.\r\nThis one has been arranged for the usual mixed voices.\r\n\r\nMasses.--The ‘D minor Mass,’ composed in 1821, is the best of his\r\nmasses and can easily be classed with his two famous Requiems. It is\r\ndignified, impressive, and at times tinged with deep sorrow. As in\r\nthe Requiems, so also here, there is much impressive fugal writing,\r\nso characteristic of Cherubini. There are also more passages for solo\r\nvoices, which at times employ a form of intonation which is almost\r\nrecitative. The work is not given as frequently as it deserves. A\r\nfragment of another mass written in 1806 and known as the ‘Eight-voiced\r\nCredo’ (_a cappella_) is heard much more frequently of late, though\r\nit has by no means the power of the preceding. The close, _Et vitam\r\nventuri sæculi_, is a masterpiece of contrapuntal writing which more\r\nthan compensates for the lack of content in the other numbers. The fact\r\nthat the form of liturgy used at the French court was peculiar to that\r\nenvironment accounts for the fragments left by Cherubini, which were\r\nevidently used in place of an entire mass.\r\n\r\nWith his usual fluency Schubert (1797-1828) wrote the first three of\r\nhis seven masses in one year (1814) and the finest of these is the one\r\nin G, which is still used in the Roman Church, and of which the _Credo_\r\nis particularly fine. These masses were heard, in Schubert’s time,\r\nonly in suburban Vienna churches, as the composer’s prestige was not\r\nsufficient for a larger hearing. Two later masses by Schubert are given\r\nnow in concert form--the one in A-flat written in 1822 and the one in\r\nE-flat written in 1828. These works were revived by Herbeck and Brahms\r\nin Vienna and belong without doubt to the very best examples of this\r\nstyle of writing--in fact, some authorities pronounce them the greatest\r\nworks of this mighty genius, excepting only the D minor Quartet.\r\nUnfortunately the parts are not all equally great. The ‘Mass in E-flat’\r\nhas a larger instrumental development than the others, the orchestra\r\noften announcing, augmenting, completing, or commenting on the text of\r\nthe choral parts, as is the case with Beethoven. Schubert’s tendency in\r\nall his masses was to use themes which approach closely to the form of\r\nthe _Lied_ as he conceived it. The _Gloria_ of this mass, as also of\r\nthe one in A-flat, is the most magnificent part of the work.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                   VI\r\n\r\nOf the two masses which Beethoven wrote, the first in C major, opus\r\n80, is overshadowed by the second in D major, opus 123. While the\r\n‘C major Mass,’ which was Beethoven’s first large choral work in an\r\necclesiastical form, may be lacking in some respects, it is by no means\r\nan unimportant or unworthy composition. Owing to the fact that he\r\ndeparted from the style of Haydn and Mozart and approached the subject\r\nfrom an entirely different standpoint, it did not find immediate favor.\r\nConflicting accounts are given as to the date of first performance\r\nwhich took place in the chapel of Count Esterhazy, the occasion being\r\nthe birthday of the Countess. Kretzschmar gives the date as Sept. 15,\r\n1807, while Grove names Sept. 8, 1807, both agreeing, however, that it\r\nwas in honor of the Countess’ birthday.\r\n\r\nThe _Missa Solemnis_, already referred to as the ‘D major Mass,’\r\nbelongs to Beethoven’s third period and is, therefore, characterized by\r\nremarkable freedom of treatment and by depth and richness of musical\r\ncontent. Although it was begun in 1818 and planned for the installation\r\nof the Archduke Rudolph, his pupil (to whom he was very devoted), as\r\nArchbishop of Olmütz on March 20, 1820, it was not completed until\r\n1823, three years after the event for which it was intended. It is\r\na sort of spiritual relative of the ‘Ninth Symphony,’ sketches of\r\nwhich had been begun as early as 1815. The two works are in the same\r\nkey and grew side by side in the composer’s thought. Three movements\r\nof the mass occupied a place on the program of the memorable concert\r\n(May 7, 1824, in Vienna) at which the ‘Ninth Symphony’ received its\r\nfirst performance, when the audience went into ecstasies of enthusiasm\r\nat the sublime grandeur of the music and the pathetic figure of the\r\ndeaf creator of such moving sounds. The mass was not performed entire\r\nuntil 1824 in Petrograd. An illustration of his habit of making the\r\nform subservient to the thought-content is the introduction of warlike\r\nmusic into the _Agnus Dei_, in order to afford contrast to the thought\r\nof peace around which the other thoughts are centred. The _Credo_ is\r\nexceedingly difficult for the singers, because of the excessively\r\nhigh range of the voice-parts and the complicated interweaving of the\r\nthemes. The _Benedictus_ is one of the most beautiful ever written\r\nand is made particularly effective by the use of the solo violin,\r\ndescending from the highest register, in a melody of beautiful\r\nsimplicity--a movement whose loveliness is still more enhanced by\r\nthe subdued chorus and accompaniment. The difficulty of the work\r\nas a whole prevents its frequent performance. The least difficult\r\nparts are the _Kyrie_ and the _Sanctus_, and the former is given a\r\nunique effect through the accompaniment, which is for organ and brass\r\ninstruments only. This work, like Bach’s ‘B minor Mass,’ requires\r\nstrong adjectives for a just valuation and when W. H. Hadow[82] speaks\r\nof it as ‘gigantic, elemental, Mount Athos hewn into a monument, scored\r\nat the base with fissure and landslip, rising through cloud and tempest\r\nbeyond the reach of human gaze,’ he merely sums up graphically the\r\ngeneral critical estimate of this great work, which, like the great\r\nBach Mass to which alone it can be compared, must be regarded, not as\r\nchurch-music or liturgical music merely, but as religious music in a\r\nuniversal sense.\r\n\r\nWeber’s masses, like many others of this early period, are now seldom\r\ngiven, though there is much good writing in them. The one in E-flat\r\nmajor, known as the _Jubelmesse_, was performed at Dresden in 1818,\r\nwhich was the fiftieth year of the reign of the king of Saxony, and, as\r\nit was an occasional work, it embodied the pomp and importance of this\r\nfestal event. The one in G, written a year later for a family festival\r\nin the King’s household, was more intimate in character. Weber wrote to\r\nRochlitz: ‘I mean to keep before me the idea of a happy family-party\r\nkneeling in prayer and rejoicing before the Lord as His children.’ Both\r\nworks manifest a devotional spirit.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                   VII\r\n\r\nHector Berlioz’ ‘Requiem,’ written during 1836-37 at the request of\r\nthe French government, was performed Dec. 5, 1837, in the Invalides\r\nin Paris at the memorial services for General Damrémont and the\r\nsoldiers who had perished in the storming of Constantina in Algiers,\r\nthe government paying the composer four thousand francs for the work.\r\nThe original purpose of the commission, however, was to have been a\r\nmemorial for those who had fallen in the July Revolution of 1830.\r\nBerlioz had completed his work and rehearsals had begun, when the\r\nMinister of the Interior who had commissioned Berlioz was succeeded\r\nby one who was of a different mind and the July festival took place\r\nwithout music. But the taking of Constantina offered Berlioz a second\r\nchance for his work. Berlioz arranged performances of it in several\r\ncities of Germany, but its wide hearing came only recently. The work\r\nis colossal, but so realistic, so almost savage in its coloring that\r\nthe hearer is fairly awed. It is also so complicated and makes such\r\ntremendous demands upon both the orchestra and the singers, that only\r\nfew organizations can give it adequate presentation and then only by a\r\nlarge addition of instruments to the full orchestra and by arranging\r\nthem in groups in various parts of the auditorium. The directions call\r\nfor four brass bands and sixteen drums in addition to the regular\r\norchestra. Extraordinary and often well-nigh impossible demands are\r\nmade upon the human voice, but, notwithstanding these drawbacks, it\r\nremains the composer’s most mature work, full of originality and\r\ncoloring.\r\n\r\nThe most remarkable part of the work--the most original and\r\ntheatrically impressive--is the _Dies iræ_, in which the composer\r\nhas used every possible tonal resource to picture the terrors of the\r\nDay of Judgment. After the choral passage beginning with _Quantus\r\ntremor est futurus_ has twice reached a forceful climax, the orchestra\r\nsoftens down for a few measures, when it suddenly bursts out with a\r\ncrash like a thunder-bolt, coming not only from the main orchestra on\r\nthe stage, but from the above mentioned bands in various parts of the\r\nauditorium. A more vivid and theatrical description of the awful day\r\ncannot be imagined, and at the climax the basses thunder out the _Tuba\r\nmirum_ amidst a new outburst from the orchestra, strengthened by many\r\nkettle-drums. So overwhelming is this volume of sound that it became\r\nthe butt of the ridicule of the critics, who declared that no such\r\noutburst of noise had been heard in Paris since the storming of the\r\nBastile! A great sense of relief comes with the quiet _Quid sum miser_,\r\nwhich Berlioz directed in the score should be sung ‘with an expression\r\nof humility and awe.’ _Rex tremendæ_ again brings in the voice-parts\r\n_fortissimo_, accompanied by crashing thunderbolts in the orchestra.\r\nThis continues up to the last few measures, _Salva me_, which are sung\r\nalmost in a whisper. One of the finest portions of the work is the\r\n_Lacrymosa_, which also abounds in striking contrasts, and contains\r\nbroad, massive harmonies and flowing melodies.\r\n\r\nA _Te Deum_ was written by Berlioz in 1835 as a fragment of a larger\r\nwork planned in honor of Napoleon. In writing it the composer pictured\r\nto himself the hero, returning from the victorious Italian campaign, at\r\nthe moment when his entry at Nôtre Dame would open the service. This\r\nheroic picture and the possibilities of the great cathedral inspired\r\nBerlioz to use, besides orchestra and organ, three choirs, including a\r\nlarge male chorus and three hundred children. In the theatrical, not\r\nto say spectacular, plan of the whole, Berlioz lost the import of the\r\nwords and thought only of tremendous effects; hence it became even\r\nmore sensational than the _Requiem_. From the standpoint of musical\r\ncolor-effects, it is a remarkable work, which is given oftener now than\r\nduring the first decades after its birth. Although written in 1835, it\r\nhad to wait until 1853 for its first performance, which took place in\r\nLondon. Thirty years later (in 1883) it had its second performance,\r\nthis time in Bordeaux--the first time in France.\r\n\r\nRossini’s _Stabat Mater_ belongs to the large class of eighteenth\r\nand nineteenth century church-music that was dominated by operatic\r\nmodels and in which the devotional and serious spirit was almost wholly\r\nabsent. The _Stabat Mater_ was written in 1832 at the request of a\r\nSpanish friend and dedicated to the Abbé Valera with no thought of\r\nits being published. However, when some rather romantic circumstances\r\nbrought it before the public in 1841, Rossini revised it and since\r\nthen, unfortunately, it has been one of the most popular of sacred\r\nworks--‘unfortunately,’ because it is almost wholly irreligious in\r\nfeeling and theatrical in mode of expression. As music, divorced\r\nfrom its text, its melodies are gay, brilliant, sensuously beautiful\r\noperatic pieces, but wholly out of place with sacred texts. The most\r\nfamous of these misplaced melodies are the _Quis est homo_ for soprano,\r\nthe _Inflammatus_ for soprano obbligato and chorus, and the _Cujus\r\nanimam_ for tenor. The nearest approach to the religious spirit is the\r\nbass aria, _Pro peccatis_.\r\n\r\nThe _Missa Solemnis_ (‘Graner Mass’) of Liszt, who seemed to love\r\ncomposition of sacred music above all else, brought to his conception\r\nof the mass a consecration which, even had he been less of a genius,\r\nwould have assured devotional music. The so-called ‘Graner Mass’ was\r\nwritten for the dedication of the Cathedral of Gran, which took place\r\non August 31, 1856. A noble atmosphere pervades the entire work and it\r\nis made especially interesting through the use of leading motives, the\r\nfirst instance of the kind in the history of the mass. It is not the\r\n‘leading motive’ of the later Wagner type, but rather the employment\r\nof themes, transformed according to context and varied connection,\r\nas Liszt had developed it in _Les Préludes_ and his piano concertos.\r\nThus the trumpet-like phrase at the beginning of the _Gloria_,\r\nreappears in the _Resurrexit_, the _Hosanna_, and the _Dona nobis_. The\r\norchestration is rich and the music always appropriate to the text.\r\nLiszt spoke of the music as having been ‘rather prayed than composed.’\r\nWhile the work shows the influence of Beethoven, it is more akin to\r\nWagner, in that the instrumental accompaniment has a larger share in\r\nthe action; this and his unusual use of thematic material give to the\r\nwork added historical importance. The performance of the mass caused\r\na controversy as to its merits and tendencies that raged for several\r\ndecades. Liszt, in all that he attempted, was a reformer. His object in\r\nthe field of church music was to bring about ‘an ecclesiastical musical\r\nstyle that should bring the liturgy of the Roman Church nearer to an\r\nintellectual and emotional expression of the age, should be in closer\r\nsympathy with existing artistic ideals as they were actually manifested\r\nin music.’[83]\r\n\r\n‘Hungarian Coronation Mass.’--This work, which Liszt wrote in 1867,\r\nthough also beautiful and interesting, is by no means as fine as the\r\n‘Graner Mass.’ Possibly it was written more hurriedly; certainly it is\r\nnot as strong as the earlier work. Both masses contain unusual effects,\r\nthrough the frequent employment of unison vocal parts.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                   VIII\r\n\r\nIn addition to the religious music already mentioned and much liturgic\r\nmusic, Gounod wrote four masses, of which the first _(Messe solennelle\r\nà Sainte Cecile_) is the most important and the most popular. The\r\nsecond (_Angeli custodes_) was written in 1882; the third (_Messe à\r\nJeanne d’Arc_) was performed at the Cathedral of Rheims in 1887 and the\r\nfourth appeared in 1888. The ‘St. Cecilia Mass’ was an early work and\r\nits unusually enthusiastic reception by the English public when several\r\nmovements were performed at a concert in London on January 13, 1851,\r\nfirst called the attention of the musical world to the young composer’s\r\ngreat ability. It was not performed entire in Paris, however, until\r\nNov. 22, 1855, at one of the annual St. Cecilia celebrations at the\r\nchurch of St. Eustache. The London success was repeated at the Paris\r\nperformance and this mass, among Gounod’s religious music, shares the\r\nsame popularity as does his ‘Faust’ among his operas. It is pervaded\r\nby an atmosphere of simplicity that offsets the dramatic painting\r\nof Berlioz. In addition it possesses grace, nobility and charm,\r\nthough its melodies are frequently cloying with their sweetness. The\r\nfinest numbers are the devotional _Kyrie_, the powerful _Credo_, the\r\nfamiliar _Sanctus_ with its fine tenor melody which recurs at the\r\nclose, delivered with full chorus in pompous, jubilant tone; and the\r\n_Benedictus_, which is treated in old ecclesiastical chant style for\r\nsoprano solo and organ accompaniment, which is later softly repeated by\r\na six-part chorus.\r\n\r\nDvořák’s _Requiem_ was written for and performed at the Birmingham\r\nFestival in 1891. The most beautiful portion is the _Agnus Dei_, but,\r\nwhile the music throughout is sad and soulful and shows excellent\r\nworkmanship, it is not as strong as the composer’s _Stabat Mater_,\r\nrevealing much imitation of Berlioz. Throughout the score (in vocal and\r\norchestral parts) he makes frequent use of a short, poignantly incisive\r\nmotive compressed within the compass of a diminished third, sometimes\r\nwith soul-shattering effect.\r\n\r\nThe _Stabat Mater_, written in 1876 and performed by the London\r\nMusical Society on March 10, 1883, on the other hand expresses much\r\nmore the strongly individual style of the composer and in consequence\r\nhas found a much stronger hold and bids fair to continue long in public\r\nfavor. It begins with a breadth and force which distinguish it from all\r\nother settings of this poem. It is conceived from a modern romantic\r\nviewpoint and is full of effective tone-painting. The portrayal of the\r\nsorrowing Mary at the foot of the cross is touchingly but majestically\r\ndrawn, and the opening quartet and chorus, _Stabat mater dolorosa_, has\r\na certain dramatic force. The composer then turns away from the dark\r\ntones--the lament and sorrow--and lets the music fittingly express the\r\nloveliness of the mother of the Saviour. The _Eia, mater_ suggests a\r\nfuneral march, with the principal motive in the bass; and the _Fac me\r\nvere tecum flere_, for tenor solo and chorus preceded by a forceful\r\norchestral introduction, is one of the most dramatic portions of the\r\nwork. The last number, _Quando corpus morietur_, is quite similar\r\nto the opening number, and the Amen, artistically wrought in double\r\ncounterpoint, brings the whole to an effective close.\r\n\r\nVerdi’s ‘Manzoni Requiem.’--On May 22nd, 1874, the City of Milan\r\nheld a memorial service at St. Mark’s Cathedral, commemorating the\r\nfirst anniversary of the death of the great poet Alessandro Manzoni,\r\nand commissioned Italy’s greatest composer, Verdi, to write a Requiem\r\nfor the occasion. The work was written mostly during the summer of\r\n1873 while the composer was in France, Verdi utilizing for its last\r\nnumber the _Libera me_ which he had five years previously written for\r\nthe projected Requiem for Rossini, in collaboration with twelve other\r\nItalian composers, a project which was finally abandoned. A gentle,\r\ndevout and thoroughly ecclesiastical spirit pervades the work, which\r\nis, however, conceived in the Italian style, therefore in lighter vein\r\nthan is the case with most of the great Requiems of history; yet its\r\norchestration and use of musical material show clearly the modern trend\r\ninstituted by Wagner. Although it had a number of hearings in Europe\r\nand in America, it is, unfortunately, seldom given now. It is conceived\r\nin the mood in which most of the great Italian composers in this form\r\nhave viewed death. There is the simple, childlike faith peculiar to the\r\nItalian people, mingled with a combination of sadness and peace--yet\r\nit is strong, expressive, and at times intensely dramatic, and always\r\nconstructed with the master’s unerring intuition for fine musical\r\neffects. While the unsympathetic German, Hans von Bülow, condemned\r\nit as ‘an opera in ecclesiastical costume,’ the world generally\r\nacknowledges that it is sincere, lovely, though dramatically strong and\r\neffective, music. The Italian wealth of melody is everywhere present.\r\nIt opens with a quiet Introit in elegiac mood (_Requiem æternam_),\r\nwhich suddenly changes in the _Te decet_, where, with an unexpected\r\nshift of key, the basses give out a fugal theme which gradually\r\nleads over to the _Kyrie_, which is sung by quartet and chorus. One\r\nof the strongest numbers is the _Dies iræ_, which is a chorus of\r\nalmost startling power, whose effects, however, are obtained through\r\nlegitimate musical means. Notably strong is the _Tuba mirum_ which\r\nenters dramatically and works up to a tremendous climax. In striking\r\ncontrast is the beautiful trio, _Quid sum miser_; it begins softly\r\nwith luscious melody and maintains its subdued tone throughout, until\r\nsuddenly interrupted by the _Rex tremendæ_, which with quartet and\r\nchorus rises through sharply contrasting _pianissimo_ and _fortissimo_\r\npassages to a most dramatic climax, continuing through the _Salva\r\nme_. In the _Agnus Dei_ an original and unique effect is obtained by\r\nletting the soprano and mezzo-soprano solo voices sing the same melody\r\nan octave apart throughout. The solo voices enter unaccompanied and\r\nthe chorus joins in here and there. The most powerful number in the\r\nentire work is the _Libera me_, which begins with a soprano solo in the\r\nfree, unmeasured intonation of old ecclesiastical psalmody, repeated\r\nin like manner by the chorus in full harmony. The solo soon leads\r\ninto the _Dies iræ_ and the introductory _Requiem æternam_, which are\r\nfollowed by a magnificent fugue in strict form on the words _Libera\r\nme_. After this there is a repetition of the solo chant and the closing\r\nunison tones in the chorus are sung with softest possible tone (marked\r\n_pppp_), leaving an effect of absolute peace and repose.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                   IX\r\n\r\nJoseph Rheinberger, whose work includes almost every form of musical\r\ncomposition, wrote twelve masses, one of which, the ‘Mass in E-flat’\r\nfor double choir dedicated to Pope Leo XIII, obtained for the composer\r\nthe order of knighthood of Gregory the Great. He wrote also a _Stabat\r\nMater_, a _De Profundis_ and much other music for the church service.\r\nAll of these, and especially the masses, are beautiful both as music\r\nand as examples of the best modern liturgical writing, and a deep\r\nreligious fervor pervades them. His appointment in 1877 as director of\r\nthe Court Church music at Munich inspired him to write prolifically for\r\nthe service of the Roman Church, to which he has contributed some of\r\nits finest modern numbers, thoroughly liturgical in spirit and in mode\r\nof treatment. For this reason they are extensively used in the Roman\r\nChurch and are not well known to the concert-goer.\r\n\r\nHenschel’s _Requiem_, opus 59, had its initial performance in Boston in\r\nFebruary, 1903, and has since been frequently heard both in Europe and\r\nAmerica. It was written in memory of his wife, Lillian Bailey Henschel,\r\nwho was one of his most distinguished pupils and who concertized with\r\nhim with signal success, especially in duet-singing. It is a grateful\r\nwork, adapted everywhere to the voices and at times strongly influenced\r\nby the song-form. It begins in deep sorrow, which is gradually lifted\r\nthrough the comfort of the church. Especially strong is the first part,\r\nwhich is an artistic masterpiece.\r\n\r\nHenschel’s _Stabat Mater_ was brought out at the Birmingham Festival\r\nin 1894, on which occasion the composer also sang the part of Saul in\r\nthe oratorio of this name by Parry, thus appearing in two important\r\ncapacities at the festival, that of composer and interpretative artist.\r\nBesides the _Stabat Mater_ and the above mentioned _Requiem_, he wrote\r\na number of sacred works in large form, among them a Te Deum, opus 52.\r\nAll are grateful and effective compositions.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe number of masses written for liturgic and concert use is very\r\nlarge, and extended enumeration of them here would be futile for\r\npresent purposes. Several notable ones, however, might well be added\r\nto our list. Among these will be found the easy and much-used ‘Mass in\r\nB-flat’ by Henry Farmer (1819-1891), a self-taught English musician;\r\n‘Mass in C’ by the Dutch pianist and composer, Eduard Silas (born\r\n1827), which won a prize of a gold medal and one thousand francs in\r\nan international competition of sacred music held in Belgium in 1866,\r\nin which there were seventy-six competitors of twelve nationalities;\r\n‘Requiem Mass’ by Robert Schumann (1810-1856), melodious and\r\nnon-liturgical in spirit; ‘Requiem Mass’ by Charles V. Stanford (born\r\n1852), in memory of Lord Leighton, produced at the Birmingham Festival\r\nof 1897 and thoroughly ecclesiastical in style and feeling; and the\r\n‘Mass in G,’ a Stabat Mater, and a Te Deum by the same composer.\r\n\r\n\r\n                              FOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[81] Kretzschmar, _Führer durch den Konzertsaal, Kirchliche Werke_, p.\r\n266.\r\n\r\n[82] ‘Oxford History of Music,’ Vol. V, p. 168.\r\n\r\n[83] Richard Aldrich in the Preface to the Schirmer edition of the\r\n‘Graner Mass.’\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                               CHAPTER XI\r\n\r\n                CONTEMPORANEOUS CHORAL MUSIC IN GERMANY\r\n\r\n     Contemporaneous Choral Music in Germany--Richard Strauss:\r\n     _Wanderers Sturmlied_; _Taillefer_; Motets--Taubmann:\r\n     _Eine Deutsche Messe_; _Sängerweihe_; Georg Schumann:\r\n     _Ruth_; _Totenklage_ and other works--Max Reger’s choral\r\n     compositions; Schönberg: _Gurrelieder_; ‘Transfigured Night’;\r\n     _Pierrot lunaire_--Other choral writers of the present;\r\n     Felix Draeseke’s _Christus_; Wolfrum’s _Weinachtsmysterium_;\r\n     Albert Fuchs; Wilhelm Platz; August Bungert’s _Warum?

And so some reader twenty-five years\r\nhence may chance to read these chapters on present-day music as seen\r\nthrough present-day eyes and may wonder that this or that composer is\r\nbarely mentioned by name or by work. Yet this method of mere tabulation\r\nmust of necessity be resorted to where works have only recently been\r\npublished and have as yet found but small public recognition; for\r\nthis volume is primarily a volume of record, not of prophecy. In each\r\ncountry, however, present musical conditions are nourished by the\r\nsurvival of tendencies and styles from the last generation and by new\r\nforces that at present appear in the guise of mere individualism.\r\n\r\nContemporaneous choral music in Germany largely represents the negation\r\nof older traditions, Handelian and Mendelssohnian, in thought and\r\nconstruction; the after-development and carrying over into the oratorio\r\nand cantata field of the principle of the Wagnerian leading-motive;\r\nand, especially, the florescence of the modern spirit of unconstrained\r\nfreedom of individual expression within very broadly defined artistic\r\nlimitations.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                   I\r\n\r\nAs Debussy in France, so Richard Strauss in Germany might be said to\r\nbe the best-known of all creative musicians who are identified with the\r\ndevelopment of choral composition along its present individualistic\r\nlines. And like Debussy, Strauss has done his most important work\r\nin the dramatic and symphonic forms, rather than in the choral. Yet\r\nhe made frequent invasions into the choral field, and always with\r\nnotable success. His _Wanderers Sturmlied_, opus 14 (composed 1883-84\r\nafter a text by Goethe), a product of his first period of creative\r\nactivity in Munich, is still a repertory number of the larger German\r\nchoral associations. It is written for six-part mixed chorus and full\r\norchestra, and though a work of the master’s youth, fascinates by\r\nreason of the strongly individual flavor of its inspiration and its\r\npower of emotional delineation. Strauss’ treatment of the poem, which\r\nwas the outcome of Goethe’s sorrow at parting with Friederike Brion in\r\nthe fall of 1771, is strongly subjective and akin to that of Brahms\r\nin the latter’s _Nänie_ and ‘Song of Fate.’ It is a moot question\r\nwhether what Romain Rolland[84] calls its ‘affected thought and style’\r\nis not rather an intimate musical sympathy with the Wertherian ideals\r\nof its eighteenth century poem. Technically far more difficult and\r\nmaking demands with which only a few of the greater German choral\r\nbodies are able to comply, are two _a cappella_ choruses, opus 34, for\r\nsixteen-part mixed chorus, composed in 1897. Not without a suggestion\r\nof Brahmsian influence is _Der Abend_ (Schiller), rich in serious\r\nbeauty, harmonious in formal and poetic working out. Rückert’s _Hymne_,\r\nits companion-piece, is conceived antiphonally, its counterpoint\r\neffortless and flowing and suggestive of Lassus at his best.\r\n\r\nDuring the first years of Strauss’ activity in Berlin (1898-1905)\r\nhe also wrote some shorter numbers, lyric and spontaneous, for male\r\nchorus: opus 42, _Liebe_ and _Altdeutscher Schlachtgesang_ (Old German\r\nBattlesong) and opus 49, _Schlachtgesang_ (Battle Hymn), _Lied der\r\nFreundschaft_ (Song of Friendship), and _Der Brauttanz_ (The Bridal\r\nDance). In 1903, however, came his splendid choral ballad _Taillefer_,\r\na setting of Uhland’s poem for mixed chorus, solos and full orchestra,\r\ndedicated to the Philosophical Faculty of the University of Heidelberg,\r\nthe dedication representing the composer’s acknowledgment of the\r\ndoctorate which the University had bestowed upon him _honoris causa_.\r\nThe solo parts are small--one, tenor, for Taillefer; another, bass, for\r\nWilliam of Normandy.\r\n\r\nThere is a great deal of rhythmically direct unison passage-work\r\nthroughout the score, which serves to throw the four-part sections into\r\nhigh relief, notably in the interlude music descriptive of the battle\r\nof Hastings, in which the masses of choral tone are handled with great\r\npower. When Strauss conducted the work at its _première_ in Heidelberg\r\n(Oct. 26, 1903), the epic ‘Song of Roland’ in particular made a deep\r\nappeal by reason of its primitive force. As much as any of his works,\r\n_Taillefer_ shows that Strauss is a poet as well as a composer. It\r\nmight almost be considered a choral pendant, circumscribed by its more\r\ndefinite textual and historical program, of the composer’s symphonic\r\n_Heldenleben._\r\n\r\nWhat is practically Strauss’ only contributions to the literature of\r\nsacred choral music, the _Deutsche Motette_ (German Motets), opus 62,\r\nafter Friederich Rückert’s words, for sixteen-part mixed chorus and\r\nfour solo voices, were completed June 22, 1913; while the composer was\r\nat the same time occupied by his ballet _Légende de Joseph_ and his\r\n‘Alpine Symphony.’\r\n\r\nStrauss’ _Deutsche Motette_ are his nearest approach to oratorio.\r\nBut if this form has not appealed to him, it has to others among\r\nhis contemporaries. In the same category as Brahms’ _Deutsches\r\nRequiem_ belongs Taubmann’s _Deutsche Messe_, first performed at the\r\n_Tonkünstlerversammlung_ in Dortmund, 1898, and given in New York in\r\n1913 by the Oratorio Society. But where the music of Brahms’ _Requiem_\r\nrepresents the deep outpouring of genuine sorrow and, owing to its\r\nconsequent lyric character and exploitation of a single mood, moves\r\nwithin a more limited circle of expression and employs an idiom\r\ncomparatively simple, Taubmann’s ‘Mass’ rings the changes of a richly\r\nvaried succession of impressions. Though the lyric element is by no\r\nmeans forgotten, the dramatic note predominates. Its beauty is cast in\r\na massive mold, and notable are the masterly choral fugues, far beyond\r\nanything the ‘German Requiem’ can show. The easily flowing, plastically\r\ncontrapuntal development of the work is wonderfully varied, and at the\r\nsame time serves primarily as an underlying river-bed above which a\r\npowerful emotional current pulses, often moving with genuine emotional\r\nstrength.\r\n\r\nTaubmann has written other choral works: a setting of ‘Psalm XIII’\r\nfor solos, chorus and orchestra; _Tauwetter_ (‘Thawing-Time’) for\r\nmale chorus and orchestra; and a _Sängerweihe_ (‘Bardal Dedication’),\r\na choral drama, which provides for a chorus and organ in the body of\r\nthe concert-hall to stimulate ‘ideal participation on the part of the\r\naudience’; yet _Eine Deutsche Messe_ will probably continue to be\r\nconsidered his greatest work, as well as one of the greatest glories of\r\nmodern German choral composition.\r\n\r\nAnother ranking work in the choral music of contemporaneous Germany\r\nis Georg Schumann’s biblical oratorio _Ruth_, for soprano, alto and\r\nbaritone solos, chorus of mixed voices and orchestra. It is a far\r\ncry to this work from Mendelssohn’s _Elijah_. Schumann, like Bossi\r\nand Wolf-Ferrari, handles his sacred text (extended by much poetic\r\nmaterial) from a secular point of view, yet with great mastery of means\r\nand undeniable effect. There is not much that is inherently sacred in\r\nthe Old Testament idyl and hence it lends itself, like the ‘Song of\r\nSongs,’ to a freer and less narrowly religious musical interpretation.\r\nOld Hebrew melodies are gracefully introduced in connection with\r\nthe composer’s own thematic material and, like César Franck in his\r\n_Rébecca_, Schumann employs every rhythmic and harmonic means, not\r\nforgetting a brilliant and individual orchestration, to give his work\r\na quasi-oriental atmosphere. As regards polyphonic handling Schumann\r\nwrites in the manner of Bach and Brahms, but identifies himself with\r\nthe present-day South German composers with respect to a rich and\r\nglowing tonal color. His choral movement is at all times plastic and\r\nexceedingly varied.\r\n\r\n_Ruth_ is undoubtedly Schumann’s most important accomplishment in the\r\nchoral field; yet he has composed other works which call for mention.\r\nHis _Totenklage_ (‘Elegiac Lament’), opus 33, and his _Sehnsucht_\r\n(‘Yearning’), opus 40, for chorus, in themselves are of such marked\r\ninspiration and artistry that they would serve to establish his\r\nreputation had _Ruth_ never been written. His _Drei Geistliche Gesänge_\r\n(‘Three Sacred Songs’), opus 31, for chorus, also testify to a daring\r\ninspiration which makes itself felt within the limitations of the _a\r\ncappella_ religious song.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                   II\r\n\r\nIn this field, too, Max Reger, a Bavarian and a brilliant member of\r\nthat South German group of composers among which Richard Strauss is\r\nthe most prominent figure, has done notable work, though his creative\r\nactivity has been displayed mainly along instrumental lines. A\r\ngrandiose setting of ‘Psalm 100’ for mixed chorus, orchestra and organ;\r\n‘12 Religious Folk-Songs of Germany’ for mixed chorus; three six-part\r\n_a cappella_ mixed choruses (opus 39) and a five-part _a cappella_\r\n‘Palm-Sunday Morning,’ to say nothing of his forty easy four-part songs\r\nfor service use, and his choral cantatas for the great festivals of the\r\nEvangelical church year--all testify to his interest in choral music.\r\nReger is a lover of elaborate counterpoint and recondite harmonic\r\ndevice and he, like Schumann, has been influenced largely by J. S. Bach\r\nand Brahms. From the former he has taken over the cult of traditional\r\nforms, from the latter he has learned to make use of the abounding\r\ntreasure of folk-song inspiration, how to pour the wine of new ideas\r\ninto the old formal bottles, and how to venture even into metaphysics\r\nin his search for exact expression. This is very evident in his secular\r\nchoral works, in _An den Gesang_ (‘To the Genius of Song’), opus 21,\r\nfor male chorus and orchestra; the _Gesang der Verklärten_ (‘The Song\r\nof the Glorified’), opus 75, for five-part chorus and orchestra; _Die\r\nNonne_ (‘The Nun’), opus 112, for mixed chorus, orchestra and organ;\r\nand the imposing _Weihe der Nacht_ (‘The Consecration of Night’),\r\nopus 119, for alto solo, male chorus and orchestra, and _Römischer\r\nTriumphgesang_ ‘Roman Triumphal Song’, opus 126, for male chorus and\r\norchestra.\r\n\r\nReger, even in his earlier works, shows a tendency toward extreme\r\ncomplexity in structure and an excess of technical elaboration which is\r\nnot counterbalanced by that strong control of imagination which makes\r\nfor ultimate clarity. On the contrary, he heaps Pelion upon Ossa in\r\nharmonic daring and arbitrary modulation. And still his is not to be\r\nconsidered the last word in this respect in choral composition, for he\r\nhas been out-Heroded by the Viennese composer Arnold Schönberg.\r\n\r\nSchönberg is the head of a school of younger Viennese musical\r\nimpressionists and independents, including Karl Horwitz, Heinrich\r\nJalowetz, Alban Berg, Anton von Webern, Egon Wellesz, who have\r\nabandoned the more romantic and classic tenets of Bruckner and Hugo\r\nWolf to follow this ultra-modern leader. One of the very few modern\r\ncomposers the performance of whose works has, on occasion, aroused the\r\nactive hostility of his audiences, he has written symphonic music (the\r\nsuite _Pelléas et Mélisande_), chamber music, songs, piano pieces, and\r\na highly original and interesting text-book on harmony. This composer,\r\n‘whose every chord is the outcome of an emotion’ and who, to quote\r\nJames Huneker, ‘has the courage of his chromatics,’ has made various\r\ncontributions to choral music, first among which is _Gurrelieder_, for\r\nsolos, chorus and orchestra, composed to a text by the Danish poet Jens\r\nPeter Jacobsen, translated into German by Robert Franz Arnold. This\r\nchoral cycle, written somewhere between 1901 and 1908, belongs in the\r\nsecond stage of the composer’s development and not in the third period\r\n(from 1908 on), during which Schönberg ‘throws over almost everything\r\nhitherto accepted, i. e., consonance, tonality, thematic use, form,\r\neven program; and retains only rhythm and color, boldly calling this\r\nmusic a mere emanation of himself, which has no relation to the\r\nreceptivities of his hearers.’[85]\r\n\r\nThe _Gurrelieder_ were heard in part, with piano accompaniment, in\r\nLondon, in 1910. In 1913 a complete performance with the enormous\r\norchestra called for by the score (including 8 flutes, 5 oboes, 7\r\nclarinets, 10 horns, 5 trumpets, 7 trombones, 6 kettle-drums, a number\r\nof other instruments of percussion, 4 harps, celesta and strings with\r\nas many individual players as possible) took place in Vienna. Opinion\r\nis still largely divided as to the ultimate value of Schönberg’s work.\r\nIt is worthy of note, however, that Ernest Newman, in ‘The Musical\r\nTimes,’ January, 1914, speaks warmly of the _Gurrelieder_, which he\r\ncalls ‘the finest musical love-poem since \"Tristan and Isolde.\"’\r\n\r\nIn addition to the _Gurrelieder_ we have from Schönberg’s pen the\r\nsextet, opus 4, ‘Transfigured Night’ (First Period), which, although\r\nnot a choral work, is conceived chorally for the strings, and is a work\r\nof exceeding beauty and original tonal combination worked out along\r\nnormal lines--an entire contrast to the _Pierrot lunaire_, a series of\r\nmelodramas of the most cataclysmic futurity, consisting of ‘three times\r\nseven poems’ by Albert Giraud, with titles such as ‘The Red Mass,’\r\n‘The Sick Moon,’ ‘A Beheading,’ ‘Gallows Song,’ ‘The Dandy,’ set for a\r\nnarrator, piano, flute (also piccolo), clarinet (also bass clarinet),\r\nviolin (also viola), and ‘cello.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                   III\r\n\r\nThough we have now considered those great figures which tower above\r\nthe general creative level in present-day choral writing in Germany,\r\nthere still remain a number of their contemporaries whose claims to\r\nrecognition cannot well be ignored.\r\n\r\nAmong them we find a group of composers who, like Reynaldo Hahn\r\nand Gabriel Pierné in France, have chosen the Christmas legend for\r\nmusical treatment. And like Hahn, some of them have essayed to\r\ndevelop text and music along lines of the mediæval mystery. Felix\r\nDraeseke’s oratorio-tetralogy, _Christus_ (published 1905), a work\r\nof splendid scope, falls short, in spite of much incidental beauty,\r\nbecause of lack of dramatic movement and interest. More successful\r\nhas been Philip Wolfrum’s _Weinachtsmysterium_ (1898), an attempt to\r\nrevive the old German Christmas miracle-play, and partially employing\r\nmediæval song and choral music as thematic material. The work shows\r\ntrue musicianship, contrapuntal skill, and tact and intelligence in\r\nwelding together its ancient and modern component elements. Other less\r\npretentious ‘mysteries’ are Albert Fuchs’ _Selig sind, die in dem Herrn\r\nsterben_ ‘Blessed are they who die in the Lord’, published in 1907;\r\nand _Das tausendjährige Reich_ ‘The Millennial Kingdom’, published\r\nin 1909. The first may be considered as belonging to the type of\r\n_Traumdichtung_[86] (dream-poem) we owe to Elgar. Its music is modern,\r\nimaginative and full of effect. Even more dramatic is ‘The Millennial\r\nKingdom,’ a succession of richly colored choral mood-pictures\r\nportraying the believers of the year 999 looking forward to the last\r\nday. This work, though essentially German, still shows the influence of\r\nPierné’s ‘Children’s Crusade,’ as does Wilhelm Platz’ _Gottes Kinder_\r\n(‘God’s Children’), an emotional and effective cantata (1907).\r\n\r\nAugust Bungert, in a larger choral three-part ‘mystery’ published in\r\n1908, _Warum? Woher? Wohin?_ ‘Why? Whence? Whither?’, is not especially\r\nhappy in a semi-religious text that smacks of theological disquisition.\r\nHis scores contain some fine solos as well as choral movements, but are\r\nnot especially well balanced, and, despite the composer’s confessed\r\nendeavor to make it another ‘German Requiem,’ it falls short of real\r\ngreatness.\r\n\r\nFelix Woyrsch, however, whose secular oratorio _Tolentanz_, opus 50\r\n(‘Dance of Death’), attains such a high level of individual expression,\r\nshows but little originality in his early work, _Geburt Christi_\r\n(‘Birth of Christ’), opus 18. It is evident, consulting the list of\r\nhis compositions, that it is the secular rather than the sacred that\r\nappeals to him. Aside from a Passion Oratorio (opus 45), ‘The Birth\r\nof Christ’ seems to be his only essay in church-music. We have on the\r\nother hand: ‘Sapphic Ode to Aphrodite’ (soprano, women’s voices and\r\norchestra); a ‘German Hosting’ (solos, male chorus and orchestra); a\r\nnumber of individual secular choruses and, lastly, ‘The Dance of Death.’\r\n\r\n‘The Dance of Death’ is written for solos, chorus, orchestra and\r\norgan, and is called a ‘mystery.’ Conceived as a great oratorio, it\r\nstands for a distinct breaking away from older oratorio tradition and\r\nis set to a text which strings together scenes from human life in\r\neffective contrast. Its music is essentially modern in spirit, full\r\nof tonal color and beauty, and logical despite excessive rhythmic\r\nelaboration. Yet it does not keep to the level of inspiration\r\nestablished by its best moments, and many sections voice a distinctly\r\npopular appeal through a thin veil of musical modernism. In the case\r\nof this work the titular use of the word _Mysterium_ is ‘merely a\r\nbeauty-plaster borrowed from the French mode,’[87] and the introduction\r\nof humorous and other elements, which are not in keeping with the\r\nserious and exalted style of the oratorio proper, tends to give it, in\r\nspite of greater length and elaboration, the character of a cantata.\r\nIn this form, or rather in that of a programmatic choral ballad with\r\norchestra, Wilhelm Berger’s _Totentanz_, after Goethe’s poem, is\r\nconceived. It is remarkably effective musically, and was one of the\r\nnumbers performed at the _Tonkünstlerfest_ at Frankfurt-on-the-Main in\r\n1914.\r\n\r\nKarl Adolf Lorenz’s oratorio _Das Licht_ (1907), a fine example\r\nof restrained modernism and beautifully wrought choral writing,\r\nand Friedrich E. Koch’s _Von den Jahreszeiten_ (‘Of the Seasons’),\r\nessentially music written for effect, though attractive in much of\r\nits detail, should also be instanced here. Some mention, too, should\r\nbe made of various prominent composers who, while their attention has\r\nprincipally been held by other forms of composition, have nevertheless\r\ncontributed incidentally to modern German choral literature.\r\n\r\nLudwig Thuille, the late gifted composer of _Lobetanz_, wrote a\r\nnumber of fine choruses for both male and female voices; Oscar Fried\r\nhas composed an _Erntelied_ (text by Metsche), opus 15, for male\r\nchorus and orchestra, a work of intense, elemental power. Engelbert\r\nHumperdinck, also, has written the choral ballads _Das Glück von\r\nEdenhall_ (‘The Luck of Edenhall’) and ‘The Pilgrimage to Keevlar,’\r\nthe last a work of much simple beauty and charm. Gustav Mahler is\r\nrepresented by his extended choral work, _Das klagende Lied_ ‘The\r\nSorrowing Song’; and Arnold Mendelssohn has created distinctive works,\r\nboth sacred and secular--the ‘Evening Cantata’ eight-part mixed chorus,\r\nsolo and orchestra, ‘Our Lord’s Sufferings’ (1900) and, in the same\r\nyear, ‘Resurrection.’ His secular choral works include a delightful\r\n_Neckreigen_ (‘Teasing Round’) for mixed chorus and orchestra;\r\n‘Spring’s Consecration,’ a hymn for solos, mixed chorus and orchestra;\r\nand ‘The Tailor in Hell,’ a drastically humorous ballad for tenor solo,\r\nchorus and orchestra.\r\n\r\nSiegmund von Hausegger, too, has written various choruses with\r\norchestra accompaniment: ‘Voices of Evening,’ ‘Sunrise,’ ‘Reaper’s\r\nSong’ (mixed), ‘New Wine Song,’ ‘Grief the Smith’ and ‘Dead March’\r\n(male), and a ‘Nature Symphony’ (1911). Hugo Kaun is the author of\r\na ‘Norseman’s Farewell’--a larger choral work for baritone solo,\r\nmale chorus and orchestra--as well as of choruses for mixed and\r\nfemale voices. And finally Hans Huber (a Swiss composer, it is true,\r\nbut educated in Leipzig, a representative of Teutonic ideals, and\r\ninfluenced by Brahms) has created beautiful music in his ‘Songs\r\nof Spring and Love,’ opus 72, for mixed chorus, solo quartet, and\r\nfour-hand piano accompaniment, and in his four-part settings from\r\nGoethe’s _Westöstlichem Divan_, opus 69.\r\n\r\nThis study of contemporaneous choral composition in Germany might\r\nfittingly conclude with a reference to the Dutch composers who have\r\nbeen influenced, creatively, by the modern German spirit in choral\r\ncomposition. Prominent among them are: Samuel de Lange, with an\r\noratorio in the grand style, ‘Moses’ (1889), original in idea but\r\ntraditional in form; ‘The Tear of a King,’ a ballad for soprano, mixed\r\nchorus and orchestra (1913), as well as various shorter cantatas to his\r\ncredit; and G. H. G. von Brucken-Fock, composer of the introspective\r\nchoral oratorio, _De Wederkomst van Christus of het naderende Godsryk_\r\n(1900). It contains a notable _Dies iræ_, ending with a double chorus\r\nafter the manner of those in Bach’s motets. The Belgian composers of\r\nchoral music, whose artistic affiliations are in general French rather\r\nthan German, will be considered elsewhere.\r\n\r\n\r\n                              FOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[84] _Musiciens d’Aujourd’hui_, Paris, 1908.\r\n\r\n[85] _Zeitschrift der Internationalen Musik-Gesellschaft_, Feb., 1914,\r\nLondon Notes, C.

This series has been augmented during the first decade of\r\nthe century by works of such splendid proportions and such already\r\nrecognized importance that at least some of them may be regarded as\r\nalready occupying places of permanency for some time to come. As the\r\nresult of this leadership, there is discernible a distinct tendency to\r\nregard Elgar as a kind of standard of measurement for British musical\r\nvalues. So much is this true that we already hear of Elgarians and\r\npost-Elgarians--for Elgar has by no means said the last word in British\r\nmusic and a school of young composers is developing that is surely\r\ndestined to accomplish great things for musical England.\r\n\r\nElgar’s most important choral works since 1900 belong to the class of\r\nreligious music and all are deeply permeated with the same spirit of\r\nmysticism that characterizes the religious music of Franck and other\r\ndevout modern adherents of the Roman Church; indeed, the Roman point of\r\nview in interpreting the teachings of the Bible and the deep things of\r\nlife, is especially discernible in ‘The Apostles’ and ‘The Kingdom,’ as\r\nwell as in ‘The Dream of Gerontius.’\r\n\r\nElgar’s mode of musical speech is remarkable, even among present-day\r\ncolorists, for its wealth of color and its richness of tonal effects.\r\nYet he is no impressionist of the Debussy type; every detail of poetic\r\nand imaginative suggestion is worked out with careful reference to\r\nits own effectiveness as well as that of the larger units to which\r\nit may belong. In his treatment of voice-parts there is a remarkable\r\nfluency and independence that suggests the old ecclesiastical\r\nmethods. There is perfect correspondence, in all matters of verbal\r\naccentuation, between melodic setting and rhetorical delivery. In\r\nhis marked preference for long lines of indefinite melodic structure\r\n(absence of definite phrases), he closely allies himself not only with\r\nthe ‘Palestrina style’ but with the Wagnerian method of continuous\r\n‘melos.’ His kinship with Wagner is further emphasized by the elaborate\r\nemployment of ‘leading motives’ in his largest works. In these motives,\r\nhowever, he is not as fortunate as was Wagner in casting them in\r\ndistinct, individual, and easily-distinguishable forms. This defect\r\nmay be inevitable, perhaps, in treating sacred themes subject to so\r\nmany purely spiritual ramifications as Elgar indulges in. As in the\r\nWagnerian scheme, so in the Elgarian, the orchestra assumes a rôle\r\nof utmost importance, frequently overtopping the choral forces and\r\nappropriating for its own purposes the composer’s choicest melodies.\r\nBut Elgar’s mode of treating the orchestra on the whole differs\r\nradically from Wagner’s because of the different points from which they\r\napproached their tasks in their respective vocal works--Wagner from\r\nthe standpoint of dramatic effect, Elgar from the standpoint of pure\r\nchurch-music. Hence in the three works above mentioned one finds, for\r\nlong stretches at a time, a spirit of lofty impersonality, an absence\r\nof sensuous melodies, which tends to lull the mind of the listener into\r\na passive condition for receiving the impressions of the text, which is\r\nby no means unlike the mental condition produced by listening to actual\r\nliturgic music.\r\n\r\n‘The Light of Life’ is Elgar’s first work in oratorio style and is\r\nshort--not as long as many sacred cantatas; yet its exceedingly serious\r\nstyle precludes its being called a cantata. It received its initial\r\nhearing at the Worcester Festival in September, 1896. The text by Rev.\r\nE. Capel-Cure relates the gospel story of the man, blind from his\r\nbirth, whom Jesus healed. The persons represented are the mother of the\r\nblind man (soprano), the narrator (contralto), the blind man (tenor)\r\nand the Master (baritone).\r\n\r\nAfter a meditative and melodious orchestral introduction the first\r\nchorus, ‘Seek Him,’ is sung, by the Levites (male voices) in the Temple\r\ncourts. The blind man’s prayer for light is followed by a recitative\r\nby the narrator. The disciples ask ‘Who did sin?’ which is directly\r\nanswered in an expressive aria sung by the mother, who asserts that\r\nhe has not been made to suffer this affliction because of the sins of\r\nothers. The Master then explains, ‘Neither hath this man sinned,’ after\r\nwhich a broad, forcible chorus, ‘Light out of darkness,’ follows. The\r\neyes of the blind man are now anointed, he washes in the Pool of Siloam\r\nand comes forth healed; then he is asked by his incredulous neighbors\r\nand towns-people how this healing came. In the heated discussion\r\nwhich follows, the music becomes very dramatic. After the blind man\r\nhas related his story, the Pharisees again enter into discussion, the\r\nstrife between those approving and those condemning the man being\r\ndescribed in a characteristic choral setting. Especially effective is\r\nthe orchestration in the scene in which the Jews question the mother\r\nand the blind man. The strongest and most beautiful part of the work is\r\na solo sung by the Master, ‘I am the good shepherd,’ which soon leads\r\nto the final chorus, ‘Light of the world,’ which, though short, is\r\npermeated by a strongly triumphant feeling.\r\n\r\n‘The Dream of Gerontius’ was written by Edward Elgar upon commission of\r\nthe Birmingham Festival Committee and performed on the morning of Oct.\r\n3, 1900, at the Birmingham Triennial Festival. Although it was finished\r\nfor this particular occasion, it had been in the composer’s mind for\r\nyears and was, therefore, not thought out in haste, as has been the\r\ncase with many other occasional works. The poem by Cardinal Newman\r\nrelates the dream of Gerontius as he lies on his death-bed, the flight\r\nof his soul to the realm of the unseen, its awakening with ‘a strange\r\nrefreshment’ as it is safely piloted before the Judge by the Angel, or\r\nSoul’s Guardian Spirit, amid the hubbub of demons and the reassuring\r\nvoices of the angels--not, however, before it has been purified in the\r\nwaters of purgatory. This poem had made a profound impression upon\r\nElgar and the words and the music are so closely wedded that they seem\r\nlike twin-expressions of the same thought, both poet and composer\r\nhaving approached their tasks from the standpoint of devout Catholics.\r\n\r\nThe work calls for only three soloists, mezzo-soprano, tenor and\r\nbass, besides chorus and unusually large orchestra, the latter being\r\naugmented by double bassoon, organ, gong and glockenspiel. The string\r\nsection is often divided into many parts, sometimes fifteen and even\r\ntwenty. Elgar employs many leading motives, characteristic of the\r\nverbal ideas with which they are associated, the orchestral prelude\r\nalone giving out ten important ones that foreshadow the scheme of the\r\nwork. In the work itself, as in all of Elgar’s later choral works,\r\nall traces of the classical oratorio disappear and solo, choral and\r\norchestral parts follow each other without pause and with utmost\r\nfreedom of movement within clearly defined scenes or parts. His\r\npart-writing is beautifully contrapuntal, but it rarely even approaches\r\nfugal writing.\r\n\r\nThe first part reveals Gerontius (tenor) on his death-bed. As the\r\nprelude closes, he sings ‘Jesu Maria, I am near to death,’ after which\r\na semi-chorus chants the _Kyrie eleison_. Gerontius is again heard\r\nin the words ‘Rouse thee, my fainting soul,’ when a second chorus\r\nresponds in tender strains, ‘Be merciful.’ The holy man then sings with\r\ndeep feeling a longer solo, _Sanctus fortis_, and after an effective\r\norchestral interlude resumes with the words, ‘I can no more,’ in\r\nwhich he expresses fear and horror at his own hallucinations. This is\r\nfollowed by a short chorus, ‘Rescue him, O Lord,’ sung by the attendant\r\npriests. Gerontius then sings his dying song, _Novissima hora est_,\r\nand the following full chorus, ‘Go forth upon thy journey,’ brings the\r\nfirst part to a close. The prelude to the second part pictures the\r\nsoul’s journey. Gerontius’ first utterance is in a dreamy solo, ‘I went\r\nto sleep and now I am refreshed,’ after which the Guardian Angel sings\r\na lovely melody called the ‘Alleluia’--‘My work is done, my task is\r\no’er.’ After a dialogue between the Angel and the Soul, their flight\r\namid howling demons of darkness to the throne of God is pictured in a\r\nvividly dramatic scene. The two again engage in dialogue, followed by\r\nan impressive chorus of the Angelicals. The Angel then sings ‘We have\r\nnow passed the gate,’ and after further dialogue the chorus is heard\r\nin ‘Glory to Him.’ Further passages between the Soul and the chorus\r\nensue, when the Angelicals join in an exultant chorus, ‘Praise to the\r\nHoliest in the height.’ In the silence following, the Soul hears the\r\ndistant voices of men on earth. The Angel’s explanation of this is\r\ninterrupted by a virile bass solo sung by the Angel of Agony, ‘Jesu,\r\nby that shuddering dread.’ The Angel then repeats the ‘Alleluia’ given\r\nin Part I and continues, amid the choruses of Angelicals and souls in\r\npurgatory, in a beautiful melody, ‘Softly and gently, dearly ransomed\r\nsoul,’ after which the work closes with the diminishing strains of the\r\nchorus of the Angelicals, ‘Praise to the Holiest in the height.’\r\n\r\n\r\n                                   II\r\n\r\n‘The Apostles.’--This, the second of Elgar’s large oratorios and\r\ncertainly one of his best, was heard for the first time at the\r\nBirmingham Festival, on Oct. 3, 1903. That Elgar had in mind the\r\nwriting of a trilogy, of which ‘The Apostles’ is the first part, is\r\nevidenced by his statement in the preface of this work that he had long\r\ndesired ‘to compose an oratorio which should embody the calling of the\r\nApostles, their teaching (schooling) and their mission, culminating in\r\nthe establishment of the Church among the Gentiles. The present work\r\ncarries out the first portion of the scheme; the second portion remains\r\nfor a future occasion.’ The text is an unusually good one, Elgar\r\nhimself having spent years on its compilation from the Scriptures and\r\nthe Apocrypha. The personages represented are the Virgin and the Angel,\r\nsoprano; Mary Magdalene, alto; St. John, tenor; Jesus, St. Peter and\r\nJudas, basses. The tenor acts also as narrator. The leading motive is\r\neven more extensively used than in ‘The Dream of Gerontius,’ and the\r\norchestra, which is large and augmented by the shofar (ancient Hebrew\r\ntrumpet), presents the most important of the themes in the prelude,\r\nthus making it a sort of musical epitome of the whole work. The text is\r\ngrouped into two large parts, with three scenes in the first part and\r\nfour in the second.\r\n\r\nIn the first scene of Part I, ‘The Calling of the Apostles,’ after the\r\nstatement that Jesus had spent the night in prayer on the mountain,\r\nthere follows the dawn, proclaimed by the watchers on the roof of the\r\nTemple. The shofar, which announces the daybreak in Jewish synagogues,\r\nat this point is heard in the orchestra. From within the Temple comes\r\nthe response, ‘It is a good thing to give thanks.’ The calling of\r\nthe apostles now follows and closes the scene. The second scene, ‘By\r\nthe Wayside,’ discloses Jesus teaching the people the Beatitudes.\r\nThe third scene, ‘By the Sea of Galilee,’ depicts the repentance and\r\nregeneration of Mary Magdalene, which is one of the finest portions\r\nof the work. It also sets forth Jesus’ calming of the storm and his\r\nwalking on the water. The second part begins with the fourth scene,\r\n‘The Betrayal,’ which includes the scenes in Gethsemane, in the palace\r\nof the High Priest and without the Temple. No other composer has\r\ntreated the betrayal at such length and it contains some of the most\r\ntouching passages of the whole work, among them the short chorus, ‘And\r\nthe Lord looked upon Peter and he went out and wept bitterly.’ In the\r\nfifth scene, ‘Golgotha,’ Jesus’ words, ‘_Eli, Eli, lama sabachthani?_’\r\nare not spoken, but their meaning is poignantly expressed in a few\r\nintroductory measures by the orchestra, after which follows a short,\r\nimpressive choral phrase of four measures, ‘Truly this was the Son of\r\nGod.’ The sixth is a short scene ‘At the Sepulchre’ and the seventh\r\nand last, ‘The Ascension,’ is characterized by remarkable ensemble\r\npassages of great sonority, the voices being grouped as follows: ‘In\r\nHeaven’ (mystic chorus of female voices in two groups) and ‘On Earth’\r\n(four solo voices and male chorus of the apostles). This section is\r\nquite long and elaborate and leads to a mighty ‘Alleluia,’ gradually\r\ndiminishing to a _pianissimo_ close.\r\n\r\n‘The Kingdom,’ which Elgar wrote for and produced at the Birmingham\r\nFestival, Oct. 3, 1906, is the second portion of the trilogy\r\nanticipated in the composer’s preface to ‘The Apostles’--the third\r\nportion, though promised, has not yet appeared. In order to set forth\r\nthe relation of the two works to each other, they were performed at\r\nthis festival in the order in which they were conceived. Much of the\r\n‘leading motive’ material of ‘The Apostles’ is also used in ‘The\r\nKingdom,’ thereby establishing a close unity between the two works.\r\nThe oratorio, the religious theme of which is the establishment of the\r\nChurch at Jerusalem, consists of five divisions: (1) In the Upper Room;\r\n(2) At the Beautiful Gate (The Morn of Pentecost); (3) Pentecost (In\r\nthe Upper Room. In Solomon’s Porch); (4) The Sign of Healing (At the\r\nBeautiful Gate. The Arrest); (5) The Upper Room (In Fellowship. The\r\nBreaking of Bread. The Prayers). The persons represented are The Virgin\r\nMary, soprano; Mary Magdalene, alto; St. John, tenor; and St. Peter,\r\nbass; the chorus represents the disciples, the holy women and the\r\npeople.\r\n\r\nAfter a long orchestral introduction, in which the important themes\r\nare stated and developed, comes the opening chorus of disciples and\r\nholy women together with the quartet of soloists, ‘Seek first the\r\nKingdom of God,’ as they are all gathered in the Upper Room. After\r\nPeter leads in the celebration of the Eucharist by the breaking of\r\nbread, they sing a hymn of praise and there follows a discussion, led\r\nby Peter, as to the choosing of a successor to fill Judas’ place. The\r\nsecond division opens with a duet of the two Marys at the Beautiful\r\nGate, leading directly into section three, ‘Pentecost,’ which is the\r\nlongest of the work and is ushered in by a tenor solo, stating that\r\nthey were ‘all with one accord in one place.’ The chorus of disciples\r\nalternates with the mystic chorus of female voices, in a description of\r\nthe descent of the Holy Ghost, the music, with the added organ in the\r\naccompaniment, being very effective. ‘In Solomon’s Porch’ sets forth\r\nthe ‘speaking in other tongues’ and Peter’s admonition, ‘Repent and be\r\nbaptized.’ The fourth section deals with the healing of the lame man\r\nat the Beautiful Gate, after which Peter and John are arrested because\r\nthey preached the resurrection of Jesus, and here the music becomes\r\nvery dramatic. It closes with Mary’s lovely meditation, ‘The sun goeth\r\ndown,’ in which two old Hebrew hymns are used. The fifth section, with\r\nthe disciples and holy women again gathered in the Upper Room, opens\r\nwith a joyful, almost triumphant chorus, ‘The voice of joy is in the\r\ndwelling of the righteous,’ after which follows ‘The Breaking of Bread’\r\nand ‘The Lord’s Prayer.’ A quiet closing chorus, ‘Thou, O Lord, art our\r\nFather,’ is sung by chorus and soloists.\r\n\r\n‘The Music Makers,’ Elgar’s opus 69, published in 1912, is a setting\r\nof an ode by Arthur O’Shaughnessy for contralto solo, chorus and\r\norchestra, the chorus bearing the brunt of the vocal work. An idea of\r\nthe content is given in the first stanza:\r\n\r\n      ‘We are the music makers,\r\n        And we are the dreamers of dreams,\r\n      Wandering by the lone sea-breakers,\r\n        And sitting by desolate streams;--\r\n      Word-losers and world-forsakers,\r\n        On whom the pale moon gleams;\r\n      Yet we are the movers and shakers\r\n        Of the world for ever, it seems,’\r\n\r\nafter which the achievements of the Music Makers are recited in the\r\nbuilding of ‘the world’s great cities’ and the fashioning of ‘an\r\nempire’s glory.’ Especially significant is the stanza beginning:\r\n\r\n      ‘A breath of our inspiration\r\n        Is the life of each generation’;\r\n\r\nand concluding with:\r\n\r\n      ‘Till our dream shall become their present,\r\n        And their work in the world be done.’\r\n\r\nThe work opens with an orchestral prelude, very melodious and noble in\r\nstyle, which, after a strong climax, leads into the first chorus, ‘We\r\nare the music makers.’ This enters softly and rises to tremendous force\r\nat the words, ‘and shakers of the world for ever.’ The composition\r\nabounds in striking contrasts of dynamics and rhythm, and while\r\nportions of it are sung in a narrative manner, there are exceedingly\r\ndramatic passages and in these Elgar calls the orchestra to his aid\r\nmost effectively. The whole work is grateful for singers and full of\r\ncolor. Possibly the loveliest part of it is the section comprising\r\nthe fourth and fifth stanzas, beginning with the above quotation, ‘A\r\nbreath of our inspiration,’ and including the first contralto solo and\r\nobbligato.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                   III\r\n\r\nThe elder composers, who first set the stream of English music in the\r\ndirection of original forms of expression, have not been idle in the\r\nyears since 1900. Alexander C. Mackenzie (born 1847) contributed to\r\nthe Leeds Festival of 1904 a cantata, ‘The Witch’s Daughter,’ adapted\r\nfrom Whittier; Henry Coward (born 1852) composed ‘Gareth and Linet,’ a\r\nmusical romance of large proportions based on Malory’s _Morte D’Arthur_\r\nfor the Sheffield Festival of 1902; and Frederick H. Cowen (born 1852)\r\nwrote for the Cardiff Festival of 1900 an oratorio, ‘The Veil,’ the\r\ntext of which is taken from Robert Buchanan’s deeply mystical poem,\r\n‘The Book of Orm,’ an apologia for the vindication of the ways of God\r\nto man, justifying death and sorrow and evil. The work is divided into\r\nthe following sections: 1, The Veil Woven; 2, Earth the Mother; 3, The\r\nDream of the World without Death; 4, The Soul and the Dwelling; 5,\r\nSongs of Seeking; 6, The Lifting of the Veil.\r\n\r\nThe veteran composer, C. Hubert H. Parry (born 1848), has been\r\nthe most active of this group, no less than three important choral\r\ncompositions having come from his pen in the first decade of the\r\ncentury. ‘War and Peace’ (1903) is a symphonic ode (text by the\r\ncomposer) in ten numbers, in which ‘the fallen angels, Pride and\r\nHate,’ are pictured as the arch-instigators of all strife. The\r\nrecompense comes after these furies have ‘drunk the lust of blood.’\r\nNumbers entitled ‘Comradeship,’ ‘Home-Coming,’ ‘Song of Peace,’ and\r\n‘Home,’ lead to a stirring and noble ‘Marching Song of Peace’ and a\r\nfinal prayer, ‘Grant us Thy peace, Lord.’ The Norfolk and Norwich\r\nFestival of 1905 brought out his setting in cantata form of Browning’s\r\nwell-known ‘The Pied Piper of Hamelin.’ Here the scholarly writer of\r\ndignified choral counterpoint becomes genuinely humorous as the tale\r\nunfolds how the rats ravaged ‘Hamelin town by famous Hanover city,’ a\r\ncharacteristic little figure being used to portray the gnawing of the\r\nrats. It is rather simple in style and an atmosphere of folk-melody\r\nand legend pervades the work. ‘The Vision of Life,’ a symphonic poem\r\nfor soprano and bass solos, chorus and orchestra, received its first\r\nperformance at the Cardiff Festival, 1907. The poem by the composer\r\npresents a vision of the course of man. Beginning with the savage\r\nand cave-dweller, it pictures Greek culture with its worship of the\r\nbeautiful, the might of Rome with its passion for power which in time\r\ngives way to the teachings of Christianity; then comes the mad fury of\r\nthe French Revolution, the oppression of the slave and the domination\r\nof pride--and all finally ‘yields to the spirit of love and of truth’\r\nand the vision pictures a future of peace when\r\n\r\n      ‘Hope and helpfulness unwearied\r\n      Make all the path a radiant mead;\r\n      And brother sees in the eyes of brother\r\n      The trust that makes toil’s best reward.’\r\n\r\nThe solo voices are The Dreamer and The Spirit of the Vision, and the\r\nmusical treatment of solo and choral parts is noble and masterful.\r\n\r\nThe untimely death of Samuel Coleridge-Taylor in 1912 (he was born\r\nin 1875) cut short a career that began with unusual promise. Though\r\nnone of his later works possesses the spontaneity and musical charm\r\nof the ‘Hiawatha’ cantatas, he has produced several fine choral works\r\nsince 1900. ‘The Blind Girl of Castél Cuillé,’ written for the Leeds\r\nFestival of 1901, is a setting of Longfellow’s translation of a Gascon\r\npoem which relates the story of a blind girl who was deserted by her\r\nlover for another maiden and who, heart-broken, dies at the latter’s\r\nwedding. ‘Meg Blane’ (a Rhapsody of the Sea by Robert Buchanan)\r\nfollowed in 1902 and was first performed at the Sheffield Musical\r\nFestival of the same year. The text weirdly describes the terrors of\r\nthe sea. ‘The Atonement,’ which closely follows the sequence of the\r\nGospel narratives of the Passion, was given at the Hereford Festival,\r\n1903, and ‘Kubla Khan,’ by the Handel Society in 1906. The ‘Bon-Bon\r\nSuite,’ which appeared in 1908, is a setting of six poems by Thomas\r\nMoore for baritone solo, chorus and orchestra. The poems are ‘The Magic\r\nMirror,’ ‘The Fairy Boat,’ ‘To Rosa,’ ‘Love and Hymen,’ ‘The Watchman,’\r\nand ‘Say, What Shall We Dance?’ The words of these poems have little\r\nrelationship to each other, though the key to the whole is probably in\r\nthe first poem, ‘The Magic Mirror.’ ‘Endymion’s Dream,’ for soprano and\r\ntenor solos, chorus and orchestra, was published in 1910. The words are\r\nby C. R. B. Barrett and are based on the ancient legend of Endymion,\r\noriginally a name for the Sun as he sinks into the sea. In the later\r\nlegend, Endymion, a priest of Jove, while sacrificing, prayed for\r\neverlasting youth. This was granted, but coupled with eternal sleep.\r\nMercury carried him to Mount Latmos and Selene, the Moon Goddess,\r\nnightly gazed down upon him lovingly. Coleridge-Taylor’s last cantata\r\nwas ‘A Tale of Old Japan,’ poem by Alfred Noyes, which was published\r\nin 1911. It is the quaint, sad story of the unrequited love of little\r\nKimi for the great painter Sawara, and the music, which is rhapsodical\r\nin character, is full of charming touches of ‘local color.’ Solo voices\r\ntake an important share of the work.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                   IV\r\n\r\nGranville Bantock, born Aug. 7, 1868, in London, is usually classed\r\nas one of the ‘middle group’ of modern English composers, to which Sir\r\nEdward Elgar belongs, in distinction to the so-called ‘post-Elgarians.’\r\nBantock is a composer endowed with vivid imagination and a strong and\r\ndistinct musical personality, exemplified in a number of important\r\nworks. He has written much for orchestra, notably the symphonic poems:\r\n‘Thalaba the Destroyer’ (after Southey), given in London, 1902; ‘Dante\r\nand Beatrice’ (Birmingham, 1903); the comedy-overture ‘The Pierrot of\r\nthe Minute,’ and the symphonic drama ‘Fifine at the Fair’ (Birmingham,\r\n1912), and, aside from a number of other works, the two orchestral\r\nscenes ‘Processional’ and ‘Yaga-Naut,’ fragments of a monster cycle,\r\n‘The Curse of Kehama,’ never completed.\r\n\r\nBantock’s leaning toward Orientalism in his music is shown in his great\r\nchoral works as well as in his symphonic compositions. To say nothing\r\nof his one-act opera ‘The Pearl of Iran,’ his six books of Oriental\r\nsongs (Arabian, Japanese, Egyptian, Persian, Indian, Chinese), his\r\n‘Ferishtah’s Fancies’ (Browning), for soprano and orchestra, and the\r\n‘Five Ghazals of Hafiz,’ for baritone and orchestra, we have his choral\r\nworks, ‘The Fire Worshippers’ and ‘Omar Khayyam,’ both constructed on\r\nlarge lines.\r\n\r\n‘The Fire Worshippers’ is a dramatic cantata in six scenes for chorus,\r\nsolos and orchestra, a work of considerable extent and making many\r\ndemands on the singers, whose story is laid in the ancient Persia of\r\nthe Magi. Its overture was performed, singly, in 1892, at a Royal\r\nCollege of Music concert, but the work was not given in its entirety\r\nuntil 1910. Though ‘rich in feeling and sumptuous in tissue, with a\r\ncurious blend of sensuousness and spirituality,’ it has never secured\r\nthe meed of favor accorded the composer’s ‘Omar Khayyam.’\r\n\r\nIn this work, ‘a union of inspired poetry with inspired music,’ to\r\nquote Rosa Newmarch, we have the composer at his best. It presents\r\nin a musical setting no less than 54 stanzas of ‘The Rubaiyat,’\r\nabout half the book, for a tremendous chorus, three solo voices and\r\na large orchestra. In his music Bantock has given these Epicurean\r\ndrinking-songs of Mohammedan Persia their inner spiritual significance.\r\nHe emphasizes their dramatic quality as songs of revolt against Koranic\r\nlaw and idealizes them as a defiance of reason and nature against\r\nreligious bigotry. The work is inordinately long, judged by ordinary\r\nstandards, and difficult of performance; yet the composer’s tendency\r\ntoward frequent modulation is always balanced by a sure sense of beauty\r\nand proportion. From the muezzin’s call to prayer at sunset ‘the work\r\nmoves on from mood to mood, from contrast to contrast--conflict and\r\nrepose, love and death, regnant glory and the dust of oblivion--in\r\na wonderful and strenuous comment on human existence.’ The more\r\ndirectly lyric stanzas are assigned to the Poet (tenor) and the Beloved\r\n(contralto); the philosophical reflections on the eternal ‘Yea and\r\nNay’ of human existence are placed in the mouth of the Philosopher\r\n(baritone). The love duets, especially ‘When you and I behind the\r\nveil,’ are rich in haunting charm, and the choruses glow with vivid\r\ncolor. Bantock’s musical Orientalism is not a mere matter of externals,\r\nof rhythms, of vocal arabesques and percussion-effects. It goes far\r\ndeeper and interprets the soul of the Orient as Pierre Loti has done\r\nin his prose poems. And on hearing Bantock’s ‘Rubaiyat’ it seems, as\r\nMrs. Newmarch beautifully puts it, ‘as though the northern wind had\r\nscattered a fresh shower of rose leaves upon the grave of Omar Khayyam.’\r\n\r\nNor has Bantock been insensible to the appeal of the myths of ancient\r\nHellas. A ‘choral symphony’ set to Swinburne’s beautiful ‘Atalanta\r\nin Calydon,’ in twenty parts, _a cappella_, performed 1912 at the\r\nManchester Festival, bears witness to the fact. It is said to be the\r\nmost difficult work ever written for unaccompanied chorus, the final\r\nmovement in particular taxing the voices to the utmost. In it the\r\ncomposer has blazed new paths of choral effect by means of groupings\r\nof variously constituted choirs, and among other of its movements a\r\n_scherzo_ for female voices is especially praised. Bantock’s other\r\nsecular choral works include: ‘The Time Spirit,’ a rhapsody for chorus\r\nand orchestra (first heard at Gloucester Festival, 1904); three\r\n‘Cavalier Tunes’ for male chorus, ‘God Save the King,’ for chorus and\r\norchestra, and various choruses for female and mixed voices, among\r\nwhich might be mentioned ‘On Himalay,’ all fine examples of original\r\nand harmonious part-writing.\r\n\r\nIn the field of sacred music Bantock has also been active. A ‘Mass\r\nin B-flat major’ for male voices (1893), an anthem, a setting of the\r\n82d Psalm, and the two oratorios ‘Christ in the Desert’ (Gloucester\r\nFestival, 1907) and ‘Gethsemane,’ should be mentioned. Of these the\r\nlatter is the more important and was given at the Gloucester Festival\r\nof 1910. An episode from the life of Christ, it has been written for\r\nbaritone solo, chorus, orchestra and organ to biblical words. A richly\r\nornamented orchestral prelude in A-flat is succeeded by a species of\r\nsymphony for baritone, orchestra and chorus in four sections: ‘In the\r\nGarden,’ ‘The Agony,’ ‘The Prayer,’ ‘Betrayal.’ Rhythmic in movement\r\nand clear in expression, its music is especially dramatic in the\r\n‘Betrayal Scene,’ which leads over to a chorus followed by a short solo\r\nand an eight-part choral finale.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                   V\r\n\r\nIn Joseph Holbrooke, born July 6, 1878, in Croydon, we have, in\r\ncontrast to Bantock, a member of that ultra-modern English school of\r\ncomposition of which Cyril Scott, ‘the English Debussy,’ is perhaps the\r\nbest known exponent. Holbrooke has attracted wide attention because\r\nof his daring individuality and his boldness of invention, as well as\r\nthe disregard for convention shown in his brilliantly colored mode of\r\nscoring for orchestra. He has chosen Edgar Allan Poe as his poet _par\r\nexcellence_ and his most important choral and orchestral works (among\r\nthe latter ‘The Raven’ (1900), ‘Ulalume,’ ‘The Haunted Palace,’ ‘The\r\nMasque of the Red Death’) are associated with the verse of the American\r\npoet.\r\n\r\nAt the Birmingham Festival of 1906 ‘The Bells,’ ‘the Mohammedan-hated\r\nBells’ of Poe and Holbrooke, jostled Bantock’s ‘Omar Khayyam,’ when\r\nheard for the first time. With remarkable breadth of tonal laying-out,\r\nand an incessant employment of chords of the eleventh and thirteenth,\r\nthe resonant clamor of the bells is brought out in the work with\r\nclever programmatic effect, in perfect accord with Poe’s words. A\r\nlong orchestral prelude leads weirdly over into the first chorus, in\r\nA minor. Following this come four choral numbers, ‘Sledge-Bells,’\r\n‘Wedding-Bells’ (female voices), ‘Alarm Bells’ and ‘Iron Bells,’ each\r\nringing the changes on the titular suggestion in appropriate tonal\r\ninflections. Holbrooke’s choral effects throughout are incisive and are\r\nheightened by a remarkable fidelity to his text.\r\n\r\n‘Byron’ (Poem No. 6) for chorus and orchestra, given at Leeds,\r\nDec. 7, 1904, is a setting of Keats’ ‘Sonnet to Byron,’ beginning\r\n‘Byron, how sweetly sad thy melody.’ As regards form it is modelled\r\nsomewhat on Beethoven’s ‘Choral Symphony,’ but the orchestra is more\r\ncontinuously active and its relation to the poem more intimate. The\r\norchestra section, in fact, is about half the work and it may be played\r\nseparately as a symphonic poem without its choral complement, a _coda_\r\nbeing provided for the purpose. There is some beautiful passage-work\r\nfor the clarinet in the orchestral score and the part-writing is worthy\r\nof all praise.\r\n\r\n‘Queen Mab’ (Poem No. 5) for chorus and orchestra, also heard at\r\nLeeds (1904), is only incidentally choral and interest is largely\r\ncentred in the orchestral part. The ‘Dramatic Choral Symphony’\r\n(homage to E. A. Poe), written around quotations from Poe’s writings\r\nand philosophical in trend, may be said to suffer to some extent\r\nfrom the difficulty of effectively setting philosophical reflection\r\nto music. This disadvantage is even more marked in ‘Apollo and the\r\nSeaman,’ a ‘Dramatic Symphony with Choral Ending for Male Choir,’\r\nwhich was produced in Queen’s Hall, London, in 1908. To quote a French\r\ncritic:[88] ‘Mr. Holbrooke, eager to show his originality, had this\r\n“illuminated symphony” given in quite a special way. Scriabine had\r\nalready added chord projections of light to his orchestra, and thought\r\nof joining perfumes to them in his future scores. Mr. Holbrooke was\r\ncontent with a projection of the magic-lantern kind. Queen’s Hall\r\nwas plunged into obscurity and the text of Mr. Trench’s poem was\r\nprojected on the sheet, Mr. Holbrooke’s chords sounding forth in the\r\nmeantime. Then, announced by the stroke of a gong, there appeared an\r\nenormous head of Apollo and, after a long pedal-point suggesting the\r\nbeginning of _Rheingold_, the seance went on, proving conclusively\r\nthat there is nothing less musical (save possibly Nietzsche) than this\r\ndialogue between a sailor and Apollo, disguised as a merchant, upon the\r\nimmortality of the soul and other poetic topics.’\r\n\r\nJoseph Holbrooke has written a number of individual anthems and\r\nchoruses in addition to these larger works, among them the ‘dramatic\r\nchoral song (No. 2)’ entitled ‘To Zanthe’ (words by Poe), not to forget\r\nthe choruses in his opera ‘The Children of Don and Dylan.’ That his is\r\na great talent is not to be denied; yet the consensus of opinion seems\r\nto agree that he has not as yet ‘found’ himself.\r\n\r\nBefore passing on to a consideration of the work of Henry Walford\r\nDavies, whose musical sympathies are those of the Elgarian school\r\nrather than those of the English modernists, we will refer, briefly, to\r\nthe choral compositions of the younger English followers of Scott and\r\nHolbrooke.\r\n\r\nGustav von Holst, born 1874, in Cheltenham, a pupil of Stanford,\r\nhas written some notable works: an _Ave Maria_ for eight-part female\r\nchorus; female choruses with orchestra in the masque ‘The Vision of\r\nDame Christian’ (1909); various cantatas and a fine tetralogy of\r\nsettings from the sacred books of India, the hymns from the Rig-Veda,\r\nfor chorus and orchestra.\r\n\r\nPercy Grainger, born July 8, 1882, at Brighton, near Melbourne,\r\nAustralia, has also contributed some charming lighter numbers, in\r\nunusual combinations, to modern English choral literature. Among them\r\nare his Kipling Choruses: the ‘Father and Daughter,’ the old Faröe\r\nIsland ballad, arranged for five solo voices (male), chorus, strings,\r\nbrass, mandolins and guitars; and the sparkling ‘Strathspey,’ combined\r\nwith several jigs and the fine old sea chanty, ‘What shall we do with\r\na drunken sailor,’ sung by male quartet to the accompaniment of eight\r\nstrings, two guitars, xylophone, flute, oboe, clarinet, bassoon and\r\nconcertina.\r\n\r\nRalph Vaughan Williams, born at Down Amprey, Oct. 12, 1872, supplies,\r\nas it were, a connecting link between the Elgarians and the\r\npost-Elgarians, the more academic and the more revolutionary among\r\npresent-day English composers. His principal choral works are: ‘Willow\r\nWood,’ a cantata (Liverpool, 1909), and two extended compositions for\r\nvoices and orchestra, ‘A Sea Symphony’ and ‘Toward the Unknown Regions’\r\n(Leeds Festival, 1907), both to poems by Walt Whitman, who with\r\nWilliams seems to take the place that Poe does with Holbrooke.\r\n\r\nIn Henry Walford Davies, born Sept. 6, 1869, at Ostwestry, we have\r\nanother composer of serious choral music along traditional lines,\r\nyet one not unaffected by modern tendencies. His music is rich in\r\nexpression, artistic conscientiousness and idealism, and his two\r\nmost important works are undoubtedly the oratorio ‘The Temple,’ and\r\n‘Everyman,’ a musical setting of a mediæval morality, the original\r\nsuggestion for which, like that of similar choral works in modern\r\nGermany, no doubt came from France. The text, with few exceptions, has\r\nbeen taken from the old English morality play: God commands Death to\r\nbring Everyman (that is, Man in general) before Him for judgment. In\r\nvain Everyman seeks companions among his servants, friends and ‘the\r\nrich’ for a journey whence none return; yet at length finds ready to\r\naccompany him (after lengthy moral disquisitions) comrades in the shape\r\nof ‘Good Deeds,’ ‘Knowledge,’ ‘Discretion,’ ‘Strength,’ ‘Beauty’ and\r\n‘Five Wits.’ The choral music throughout is spontaneous, vivid and\r\nrealistic. ‘Everyman’ was composed for the Leeds Festival of 1904,\r\nat which it scored a marked success. A short prelude of thirty-two\r\nmeasures is the keynote to the entire work and leads directly to a\r\nprologue (addressed to the audience), delivered by bass, contralto,\r\nsoprano and tenor. The chorus of ‘laughing, feasting rich men,\r\nreclining upon their cushions, is a splendid bit of musical realism,\r\nwhich shows better than any theoretical disquisition how standards\r\nof taste in English oratorio have satisfactorily rid themselves of\r\nPuritanic influences in the course of years.’[89] Davies’ biblical\r\noratorio, ‘The Temple’ (Worcester Festival, 1902), is an oratorio\r\npure and simple, austerely beautiful and rather complex in its choral\r\nwriting, but lacking, perhaps, the inspirational freshness of its more\r\ndramatic successor. ‘The Song of Thanksgiving’ is generally considered\r\nthe finest single number in the score.\r\n\r\nDavies has also composed: ‘Hervé Riel’ (Browning) for baritone solo,\r\nchorus and orchestra (Royal College of Music, 1895); ‘Four Songs\r\nof Innocence’ (part-songs for female voices, 1894); ‘Ode to Time’\r\n(baritone solo, chorus and orchestra) and ‘Noble Numbers’ (a cycle of\r\n18 songs for solo voices, chorus and orchestra); ‘The Three Jovial\r\nHuntsmen’ (cantata with orchestra, 1900); a ‘Morning and Evening\r\nService’ and a ‘Cathedral Service’ and ‘Lift up your hearts’ (Hereford\r\nMusic Festival, 1906).\r\n\r\nAmong other names which seem to call for mention in connection with\r\nrecent English choral writing are: Bradley Rootham (a fine cantata\r\nto Charles Kingsley’s ‘Andromeda,’ for solos, chorus and orchestra);\r\nAlexander M. McLean (a cantata, ‘The Annunciation,’ influenced by\r\nReger, 1909); Henry Wood (‘Elijah,’ 1902); Alfred Herbert Brewer\r\n(‘The Holy Innocents,’ oratorio, 1904, ‘Emmaus’); Harvey Lohr, F. W.\r\nHumberston and C. Lee Williams.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                   VI\r\n\r\nConditions in contemporaneous American choral writing are quite\r\nanalogous to those in England. Several of our most prominent choral\r\nwriters had already won substantial recognition before the twentieth\r\ncentury opened. Foremost among these elder composers who have continued\r\nto write in the concert forms of oratorio and cantata are George\r\nW. Chadwick (born 1854) and Horatio W. Parker (born 1863). But a\r\nhost of younger composers has arisen to seek artistic preferment in\r\nthis field. This augmented interest is no doubt due in part to the\r\nremarkable increase in the number of choral societies in the United\r\nStates beginning in the last decade of the nineteenth century and the\r\nconsequent increase in the demand for choral novelties; but it is due\r\nin still larger part to the increased interest in composition itself\r\nin the United States, an interest that has been fostered and nourished\r\nby a noticeably greater willingness on the part of the American public\r\nin the most recent years to receive with some favor really meritorious\r\nworks by native composers. This meed of home recognition, the greatest\r\npossible stimulus to all creative purpose, will no doubt increase in\r\nmeasure with the years.\r\n\r\nHoratio Parker has added several to his already long list of choral\r\nworks given in Chapter VI: ‘King Gorm the Grim’ (1908), a fiery choral\r\nballad on a Danish theme (words after Theodor Fontane); ‘The Leap of\r\nRoushan Beg’ (1913), a ballad for men’s voices with tenor solo (poem\r\nby Longfellow); ‘Alice Brand’ (1913), a short cantata for three-part\r\nfemale chorus with solos (poem by Sir Walter Scott); and ‘A Song of\r\nTimes,’ a short cantata for chorus and orchestra.\r\n\r\nIn ‘Morven and the Grail,’ Parker has produced his largest choral\r\nwork since the _Hora Novissima_ and ‘Legend of St. Christopher.’\r\nThis oratorio was written for the Centenary Festival of the Handel\r\nand Haydn Society of Boston, April 11-15, 1915. It calls for four\r\nsoloists--Morven, baritone; Sigurd, tenor; St. Cecilia, soprano; Our\r\nLady, alto; Angels of the Grail, a second solo quartet. The poem by\r\nBrian Hooker is a work of unusual charm and has accompanying it a\r\nquaint synopsis of the story, relating how ‘Morven, seafaring upon\r\nthe quest of the Grail, heareth the Angels thereof calling to him,\r\nand will follow the world’s dream even unto the end of the world. He\r\ncometh to Avalon, the heaven of Pleasure, and there for a time abideth\r\nin bliss.’ But hearing Sigurd, the Volsung, riding against the Dragon\r\nand realizing that man can not be content forever in joy, he departeth\r\nand cometh to Valhalla of the Old Gods, where he abideth in glory\r\nuntil, ‘hearing in his soul as it were the voice of St. Cecilia hymning\r\nChrist her Lord,’ he proceedeth to the Saints in Paradise, the heaven\r\nof holiness, where again for a time he abideth in peace. In spirit he\r\nheareth ‘Our Lady communing with her child new-born into the world’ and\r\nlearneth that man may not forever content himself at rest and that the\r\ndesire of the soul is not to be found in Paradise, nor in any place,\r\nbut that it followeth everywhere; ‘wherefore he will depart out of that\r\nheaven to be born again and become as a little child.’ The heavens\r\nbeing then opened to him, in a vision he heareth the song of the Grail\r\nand the Angels singing of man, living on ‘between Hell and Heaven in\r\nwonder everlasting.’ The closing argument is as follows: ‘And forasmuch\r\nas God of His own heart so imagineth all things that they die and\r\nrise again, therefore shall the earth declare the glory of God, world\r\nwithout end.’\r\n\r\nGeorge W. Chadwick has written in nearly all the larger forms of\r\nchoral, orchestral and chamber music. In the opening years of the\r\ncentury he wrote two choral works of large dimensions, ‘Judith’ and\r\n‘Noël,’ both in oratorio form, though the action of the first is so\r\nintense and dramatic that it could well be performed with full operatic\r\nmachinery. Both are conceived in the form of the classical oratorio,\r\nthough Chadwick’s musical vocabulary is clearly modern, his harmony\r\nbeing rich, warm and distinctly individual. ‘Judith’ is a work of\r\nmassive proportions, one of the few great choral works yet produced\r\nin America. ‘Noël’ is simpler in structure, yet contains numbers of\r\ncompelling beauty.\r\n\r\n‘Judith,’ a lyric drama in three acts, was published in 1901.\r\nThe persons represented are Judith, mezzo-soprano; Achior, tenor;\r\nHolofernes, baritone; Ozias, bass; and Sentinel, tenor. The text by\r\nWilliam Chauncey Langdon is cast in three acts. The first, in Bethulia,\r\npictures the sorrows of Israel beset by Asshur’s host, to which the\r\nIsraelites are about to yield when the entreaties of Ozias persuade\r\nthem to trust the Lord five days longer. Judith relates her vision, in\r\nwhich her departed husband directs her to save her people by destroying\r\nHolofernes. The second act brings her to the camp of Holofernes, who\r\nis completely infatuated with her beauty. She insists upon becoming\r\nhis cup-bearer, and after he has partaken too freely of wine, she\r\n(still responding to the vision) slays him with his own sword and\r\nconceals his head in the folds of her dress as she passes the guards,\r\nwhom Holofernes had commanded to let her pass freely in and out. The\r\nthird act begins with her return to Bethulia just as Ozias once more\r\nkneels at the wall, praying for deliverance. As she shows the head of\r\nHolofernes there is great rejoicing and the victory of the Israelites\r\nover the Assyrians is proclaimed.\r\n\r\n‘Noël,’ a Christmas pastoral for four solos, chorus and orchestra,\r\nwas written for the Litchfield County (Conn.) University Club and\r\npublished in 1909. The text is compiled from various sources, most\r\nof which are named. The work consists of twelve numbers, besides an\r\norchestral prelude entitled ‘The Star.’ No. 1 is a chorus, ‘This is the\r\nmonth’ (words by Milton); No. 2, ‘From the eastern mountains’ (words by\r\nThwing), depicts the journey of the Wise Men; No. 3, ‘Long and darksome\r\nwas the night,’ is an alto solo (words by Ray Palmer, 1830); No. 4 is\r\na chorus for female voices, _Parvum quando cerno Deum_, the authorship\r\nof the Latin text being unknown; No. 5 is a bass solo, ‘I was a foe to\r\nGod,’ words by Torsteegen, 1731; and No. 6 a chorus of praise, ‘Praise\r\nHim, O ye heaven of heavens,’ with words by Prudentius, A. D. 405.\r\nNo. 7 begins the second part with ‘While to Bethlehem we are going,’\r\nfor alto solo and chorus, words by Violante de Ceo, 1601; No. 8 is a\r\nsoprano solo, ‘Hark! a voice from yonder manger,’ words by Gerhardt,\r\n1656; No. 9 is a carol from the Latin of the fourteenth century, ‘A\r\nchild is born in Bethlehem,’ which can be sung unaccompanied; No. 10\r\nis a tenor solo, ‘O holy Child, Thy manger streams,’ words from the\r\nDanish; No. 11, a quartet, ‘Hither come ye heavy-hearted,’ words by\r\nGerhardt, 1656; and the last number, ‘How lovely shines the morning\r\nstar,’ words by Nikolai, 1597, is a stately chorale and fugue for\r\nchorus and quartet.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                   VII\r\n\r\nHenry K. Hadley (born 1871) is prominent among the group of younger\r\nAmericans who have assiduously cultivated choral writing, having\r\npublished seven or eight choral works of varying size, up to the\r\npresent time (1915). His first cantata was ‘In Music’s Praise,’\r\nwhich won the prize offered in 1901 by the Oliver Ditson Company,\r\nmusic-publishers. This was followed in 1904 by ‘A Legend of Granada,’\r\na cantata for women’s voices with soprano and baritone solos (words\r\nby Ethel Watts Mumford). Four other cantatas for women’s voices with\r\nvarious solo parts succeeded this one--‘The Fate of Princess Kiyo’\r\n(1907), a legend of Japan (words by Edward Oxenford); ‘The Golden\r\nPrince’ (1914); ‘The Nightingale and the Rose’ (1911); and ‘The\r\nPrincess of Ys.’\r\n\r\nHadley’s longest choral work is the lyric drama ‘Merlin and Vivian’\r\n(1907), to the poem by Ethel Watts Mumford, an ambitious composition\r\ncalling for the full resources of solo, choral and orchestral forces.\r\nIt is in three parts, whose scenes are laid respectively on the ‘Isle\r\nof Avalon,’ at King Arthur’s court, and at Castle Joyousguard. The\r\ncharacters are Morgan-le-Fay, the enchantress, Queen of Avalon; Vivian,\r\nthe sorceress; King Arthur; Merlin, the enchanter, Arthur’s councilor;\r\nAdrihim, the spirit of the architect of King Suleiman; and Ariel, the\r\nspirit of music and light.\r\n\r\nFrederick Shepherd Converse (born 1871), after several orchestral\r\nworks in the larger forms, entered the choral field with a composition\r\nof oratorio dimensions, ‘Job,’ a dramatic poem for solos, chorus and\r\norchestra, which was composed for the fiftieth annual festival of\r\nthe Worcester (Mass.) Musical Association in 1907. The text is taken\r\nfrom Job and the Psalms in the Vulgate. accompanied with an English\r\nparaphrase. The characters represented are Job, tenor; his Friend,\r\nbaritone; a woman of Israel, mezzo-soprano; and the voice of Jehovah,\r\nbass; the chorus represents the voices of prayer and adoration. A\r\npreface to the work points out that ‘the dramatic motive of the poem\r\nis the development of the moods of Job, distress under suffering,\r\nrebellion, doubt, and final submissive understanding of the will\r\nof God. In emotional contrast with him is the Woman of Israel, who\r\nrepresents the spirit of unquestioning faith. The Friend stands, like\r\nthe three friends of the Bible story, for the spirit of conventional\r\npiety. The chorus represents superhuman voices, which declare the glory\r\nof God; against their sustained mood of adoration and praise beats\r\nthe contest of human emotions. The impersonal universal spirit of the\r\nchorus is conveyed in the music by simple diatonic harmonies, the warp\r\nupon which the solo parts are woven in modern chromatic design.’\r\n\r\nOther choral compositions by Converse are a ‘Serenade’ (1908) for\r\nsoprano and tenor solos, male chorus and small orchestra (text by John\r\nMacy) and ‘The Peace Pipe’ (1915), a cantata for baritone solo, mixed\r\nchorus and orchestra to text from Longfellow’s ‘Song of Hiawatha.’\r\nLongfellow, who has probably furnished more texts for cantatas and\r\nchoral ballads than any other one poet, is also drawn upon by Carl\r\nBusch for his cantata, ‘The Four Winds’ (1907) (again from ‘The Song\r\nof Hiawatha’), a lengthy work calling for soprano and tenor solos with\r\nchorus.\r\n\r\nRossetter Gleason Cole (born 1866), in his lyrical idyl, ‘The Passing\r\nof Summer’ (1902), written to a libretto by Elsie Jones Cooley,\r\npresents a pastoral scene in which two lovers go forth at the dawning\r\nof summer’s last day and witness gracious Summer’s farewell to all\r\nher children--the summer winds, the falling leaves, the soft-hued\r\nflowers--but as evening falls they rejoice that love’s flower, which\r\nSummer had planted in their hearts, dies not. The score, which is\r\nquite lengthy, demands soprano, tenor and contralto solos, chorus and\r\norchestra.\r\n\r\nDavid Stanley Smith (born 1877) appears among the list of choral\r\nwriters with two short works--‘The Logos’ (The Word is Made Flesh),\r\npublished in 1908, which is a Christmas cantata for three solo voices\r\n(The Logos, the Angel Gabriel and Mary) and chorus of angelic voices\r\nand voices from earth; and ‘God our Life’ (1906), a sacred cantata for\r\ngeneral use.\r\n\r\n\r\n                              FOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[88] _Les Post-Elgariens_, par X.-M.

In particular the oratorio and sacred cantata may be\r\nsaid to represent the larger fruition of what Romain Rolland calls\r\n‘the new religious art which has sprung up since the death of César\r\nFranck, around the memory of that great musician.’ Pierné, d’Indy,\r\nSchmitt--some of the most distinctive composers of modern France--have\r\nbeen influenced by the Belgian master in a greater or less degree.\r\nHence it is not strange that the best-known French choral works of the\r\npresent day in the larger forms are of a religious or quasi-religious\r\nnature.\r\n\r\nThus, even in the case of Debussy (less directly influenced by\r\nFranck than any of his contemporaries), we find that two of his three\r\nprincipal choral works, the lyric scene _L’enfant prodigue_ and the\r\n‘mystery’ _Le martyre de Saint-Sébastien_, are developments of Biblical\r\nand hagiographic text-motives. And even in his _Damoiselle élue_, a\r\ncantata for female voices with solos, the heroine of Rossetti’s famous\r\npoem (to a French paraphrase of which Debussy has written his score)\r\nlooks down from the ramparts of her pre-Raphaelite paradise.\r\n\r\nIn _L’enfant prodigue_ (Roman Prize, 1884), its composer does not\r\nas yet inaugurate those radical changes which were to find complete\r\nexpression in his later works. It may be briefly described as a simple\r\nand expressive miniature oratorio, including duets, trios, a cleverly\r\nwritten _cortège_ and dance, whose frequent recitative anticipates the\r\nmelodic declamation employed in _Pelléas et Mélisande_.\r\n\r\nBut when Debussy sent in his _Damoiselle élue_ (first published in\r\n1887) from Rome, the departure, from accepted standards was more\r\nmarked. Its music is rich in delicate imagery and attention to detail,\r\norchestral and vocal, yet despite its subtle expression of the yearning\r\nof the translated for the one left behind on earth--the chorus of\r\nsopranos descending in flexible, fluid cadences as the Blessed Damozel\r\n‘leans out from the gold bars of Heaven’ and ‘casts her arms along the\r\ngolden barriers’--the customary public hearing accorded ‘works sent\r\nfrom Rome’ was denied it in Paris. Since then, however, its composer\r\nhas not had to complain of a lack of performances.\r\n\r\nIt is the five-act mystery _Le martyre de Saint-Sébastien_, given\r\nin 1911 at the _Châtelet_ theatre in Paris, which is Debussy’s most\r\nambitious and individual contribution to the literature of the\r\nnewer French choral art, though the music is really incidental to\r\nD’Annunzio’s drama. In general, the greatest French critics paid\r\ntribute to the merits of the work. Alfred Bruneau spoke of ‘its\r\nclarity, serenity and strength,’ insisting that while the composer had\r\nhitherto given his attention mainly to the instrumental forms, he had\r\nattained new power in the choral portions of _Le martyre_. He dwells\r\non the beauty of the lament of the women at Sébastien’s death, and the\r\n‘vast and magnificent’ final _alleluia_. Pierre Laloy does not share\r\nBruneau’s enthusiasm for the choral close. He admits its ‘occasional\r\nPalestrinian character,’ but deprecates the intrusion of trifling\r\nmotives evidently used for effect alone. Robert Broussel counts the\r\nfour Preludes, hieratic and voluptuous, among Debussy’s most finished\r\npages. Reynaldo Hahn laments a lack of continuity in the score. Yet all\r\ncritics agree, in the main, on the interest and artistry of the score,\r\nin which the religious feeling is strongly and definitely marked.\r\n\r\nThis concludes the tale of the composer’s choral compositions of a\r\nreligious nature, but no mention of Debussy’s activity in the choral\r\nfield would be complete without a reference to his lovely _a cappella_\r\nchoruses, _Chansons de Charles d’Orleans_, practically the only secular\r\nmusic for chorus which he has written, but music well worth careful\r\nstudy.\r\n\r\nNotwithstanding the religious expressiveness which permeates _Le\r\nmartyre_, as witness the musical treatment of its last scene in which\r\nparadise unfolds its gates amid a golden glory of angel hosts, it\r\nis Gabriel Pierné whose scores are the most successful examples of\r\noratorio composition in modern France. Reynaldo Hahn, it is true, in\r\na manner anticipated Pierné’s _Enfants de Bethlehem_ in 1901, with a\r\nChristmas oratorio, _Pastorale de Noël_, written upon the text of one\r\nof the great passion-mysteries of the thirteenth century, using the\r\nactual mediæval words and thus projecting the liturgic drama of the\r\nMiddle Ages into the present day. Yet his work has never attained that\r\nwider public recognition accorded Pierné’s oratorios.\r\n\r\nOn these rest the latter’s fame, though he has written a secular\r\ncantata, _Edith_ (1882), and a prize symphony for chorus and orchestra,\r\n_L’an mil_. _La croisade des enfants_ (known throughout this country\r\nas ‘The Children’s Crusade’), _Les enfants de Bethlehem_ and, finally,\r\n_Les fioretti de Saint-François d’Assisi_, are his chief works.\r\n\r\nThe ‘Children’s Crusade’ and the ‘Children of Bethlehem’ are\r\n‘mysteries,’ but not in the sense of Debussy’s impressionistic\r\n_Martyre_, or Hahn’s mediæval Christmas ‘Miracle.’ The ‘Children’s\r\nCrusade’ has been set to a libretto after Marcel Schwob’s poetic story;\r\nthe ‘Children at Bethlehem,’ to a poem by Gabriel Nigond. Both scores\r\nare musically full of color and rich in pictorial detail, employing the\r\nfolk-song thematically. Their great effect lies in the introduction of\r\nthe children’s chorus as a strong factor in the musical development\r\nof the oratorio. The criticism has been made,[90] in particular with\r\nregard to the ‘Children’s Crusade,’ that the picturesque mingling\r\nof male choruses, female choruses, solo voices, humming choruses,\r\necho choruses, voices from above and from the distance, together\r\nwith the choruses of children and full orchestra in a succession of\r\nnerve-stimulating episodes, seems due to deliberate calculation,\r\nspeculating on the emotional and nervous sensibility of the general\r\npublic, and that as a consequence the music lacks genuine intimacy\r\nand warmth. Be this as it may, the composer has been superlatively\r\nsuccessful in creating works whose performance awakens widespread\r\npleasure and appreciation.\r\n\r\nIn _Saint-François d’Assisi_, set to a poem by Gabriel Nigond after\r\n‘The Little Flowers of St. Francis,’ Pierné again uses Christian\r\nlegendary material. His music portrays, with less of austere dignity\r\nand serious depth than Tinel’s famous ‘Franciscus,’ yet with a more\r\nmelodious facility of touch, the life-cycle of the sermonizer of\r\nthe birds and founder of the order which bears his name. Like its\r\npredecessors, it has much spiritual charm and delicacy of expression;\r\nas in them, the standpoint of tonal effect is kept well in view\r\nand--another resemblance--the score has been successful, though not,\r\nperhaps, in the same degree as the others. Still, Pierné’s writing has\r\nnot the dramatic power and individual flavor to be found in the works\r\nof some of his _confrères_.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                   II\r\n\r\nNotable among these is Florent Schmitt, a pupil of Gabriel Fauré (who,\r\nby the way, has contributed to French choral literature some charming\r\nshorter works--_La naissance de Vénus_, _Les Djinns_, and _Madrigal_).\r\n_Danse des Devadesis_ is especially notable for brilliant color and\r\nsubtly suggestive rhythms. Florent Schmitt’s _Tragédie de Salomé_ in\r\nits symphonic form is well known to the American concert-goer, but the\r\nsame cannot be said of his ‘Psalm XLVII,’ for orchestra, organ, chorus\r\nand solo voices, though it exists in an edition with English text, and\r\nis a musically distinctive and original work. Its keynote is praise and\r\njoy, and it bids ‘the people clap their hands’ and proclaims that ‘the\r\nfields of the earth belong to the Lord’ with real dramatic effect and\r\nvigor.\r\n\r\nIt is in the work of Vincent d’Indy, principal heritor of the musical\r\nand spiritual legacy of César Franck, that a more conservative\r\nstandpoint makes itself felt. And this is only natural, when we\r\nconsider that the counterpoint of the sixteenth century is the point\r\nof departure of the composer’s own creative activity. He stands for\r\nthe classic tradition persisting along modern lines of development.\r\nHis sympathies are with Wagner rather than Debussy, and in his operas\r\nor, as he terms them, ‘dramatic actions,’ _Fervaal_ and _L’Etranger_,\r\nhe merges Wagnerian practice and his individual concept with effective\r\nresults, though with a rejection of all that atmospheric vagueness\r\nwhich makes the charm of _Pelléas_.\r\n\r\nHis best known choral work is _Le chant de la cloche_ (‘Song of the\r\nBell’), awarded a prize by the City of Paris in 1885. This is a\r\ndramatic legend, opus 18, for chorus, solos and orchestra, broad in\r\noutline, rich in detail, Wagnerian in structure, yet the composer’s own\r\nin thematic content. The orchestra is handled with great brilliancy. A\r\nlater work, opus 23, _Sainte-Marie Magdeleine_, a cantata for two solo\r\nvoices, female chorus and accompaniment of harmonium and piano, is a\r\nwork of the type of Debussy’s _Enfant prodigue_, a miniature oratorio\r\nintended to form part of an evening’s concert-program. It is needless\r\nto add that, musically, it shows no semblance to Massenet’s oratorio\r\nof the same name. We have also by d’Indy _La Chévauchée du Cid_, a\r\nHispano-Moorish scene for baritone, chorus and orchestra; a ‘Festival\r\nCantata’ for inaugural purposes; an _Ode à Valence_, for solo, chorus\r\nand orchestra; and _L’Art et le Peuple_, for four-part male chorus.\r\n\r\nFor some time d’Indy has been working upon a dramatic choral work on\r\nan extended scale, _La légende de Saint-Christophe_ (a subject which\r\nRheinberger and Horatio Parker have already treated in oratorio form),\r\nand it is said to be nearing completion. It will be looked forward\r\nto with interest, especially as it represents one of the composer’s\r\nperiodical returns from symphonic to choral composition.\r\n\r\nWhile the works of the composers already discussed may be said to\r\nrepresent the most important achievements in contemporary French\r\nchoral writing, a number of others have been more or less active in\r\nthe same field. Among these are: Gustave Charpentier (tone-drama, _La\r\nvie du poete_, 1892), the late Augusta Holmès (_Hymne à Apollon_,\r\ndramatic scene, and _Nocturne_, both for baritone solo and chorus.\r\n_Danse d’Almées_, for contralto solo and chorus, and ‘The Vision\r\nof the Queen,’ scene for solos and female chorus); C. de Grandval\r\n(_Sainte Agnes_, dramatic cantata, 1892); Bourgault-Ducoudray (_Esprit\r\nde la France_, for mixed chorus) and others; but in general the\r\nultra-modernists, Ravel, Dukas, Magnard, and others have neglected the\r\ndomain of choral for that of symphonic composition.\r\n\r\nIn Belgium contemporary choral composition since Peter Benoît has\r\nbeen influenced by the Neo-French school. We have G. L. Huberti’s _De\r\nlaatste Zonnestraal_ (1892) and (in manuscript) _Verlichtung_ (1882),\r\n_Bloemardinne_ and ‘Death of William of Orange,’ A greater tone-poet\r\nis Émile Mathieu, with three secular choral works, _Le Hoyoux_, _Le\r\nSorbier_ and _Freyhir_ (1893). Jan Blockx’s cantatas are mostly founded\r\non national episodes. Among them are: _Vredezang_, _Het droom van’t\r\nparadies_, _Clokke Roelandt_, _Scheldezang_ (1903). The ‘Roland’\r\ncantata is his best-known choral number. Edgar Tinel’s dramatic\r\noratorio, _Franciscus_ (1888), is the greatest choral work the Flemish\r\nschool has produced. It has been more fully noted in Chapter IX.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                   III\r\n\r\nIn Italy the renaissance of choral composition might be said to\r\nbegin in 1898, with Don Lorenzo Perosi’s appointment as director of\r\nthe Sistine Chapel in Rome. In his sacred trilogy, _La Passione di\r\nCristo_, comprising (a) _La Cena del Signore_, (b) _L’Orazione del\r\nMonte_, (c) _La Morte del Redentore_ (performed for the first time\r\nat Milan, 1899, at the Italian Congress of Sacred Music), and in his\r\noratorios, _La Transfigurazione del Nostro Signor Gesù Cristo_ (1898),\r\n_La Risurrezione di Lazaro_ (1898), _Il Natale del Redentore_ (1899),\r\n_Mosè_, and _Il Giudizio Universale_ (1903), all written in a style\r\n‘made up of all styles and ranging from the Gregorian chant to the\r\nmost modern modulations,’[91] he shows deep melodic instinct, richness\r\nof melodic invention, and a strong dramatic veritism which has done\r\nmuch to make them popular in Italy. ‘Each of the oratorios,’ to quote\r\nagain the great French critic, ‘is really a descriptive mass, which\r\nfrom beginning to end traces out one dominating thought.’ Critics in\r\ngeneral are still divided as to the ultimate value of his music; but\r\nits sincerity and strength of purpose are unquestioned.\r\n\r\nOf greater importance than Perosi’s disciples Giovanni Tebaldini\r\n(_Le Nozze de Cecilia_), and Alfredo Ambrogio (_L’Entrata di Cristo\r\nin Gerusalemme_), is Enrico Bossi. The latter’s oratorios, _Canticum\r\ncanticorum_ (1900) and _Il Paradiso perduto_ (1903), are distinctly\r\nconcert oratorios in the grand style, more strongly individual and\r\nless mystically religious than Perosi’s. His treatment of Solomon’s\r\nglowing ‘Song of Songs’ is musically sensuous rather than symbolic,\r\nand at times suggestive, in its passion, of Massenet. It is a work\r\nrich in imaginative development and, again in contrast to Perosi,\r\nthe weight is laid on its choral rather than its solo portions. The\r\nsecular trend is even more marked in _Il Paradiso perduto_, and some\r\nof its movements are to be reckoned among the finest in modern choral\r\nliterature. In both these works, as in his secular cantata _Giovanna\r\nd’Arca_, and his symphonic poem _Il Cieco_, with tenor solo and chorus,\r\nBossi has infused the spirit of modernism into the Italian oratorio,\r\nand developed it beyond the purely ecclesiastical concept represented\r\nby Perosi.\r\n\r\nIn this direction the influence of Ermanno Wolf-Ferrari, better\r\nknown, perhaps, as a composer of opera than of oratorio, has also\r\nbeen noteworthy. His cantata, _Talitha kumi_ (‘Maiden, arise’), on\r\nthe favorite subject of the daughter of Jairus, written in 1900, was\r\nfollowed by the oratorio _Sulamith_, which, if not dramatically as\r\nstrong as Bossi’s _Canticum_, betrays melodic charm and warm orchestral\r\ncoloring.\r\n\r\nHis greatest choral work, however, is undoubtedly his _La Vita Nuova_,\r\nopus 9, in which, using Dante’s text, he has woven together incidents\r\nof the love-life of Dante and Beatrice in a succession of idyllic and\r\nlyric mood-pictures. The suggestive power of the work is remarkable;\r\ndramatic effect, rhythmic variety, harmonic subtlety are combined in\r\nwell-nigh perfect expressional unity. The composer has followed his own\r\ninspiration throughout, and that with the happiest artistic results.\r\nThere need be no hesitation in affirming that this choral work marks\r\nthe apex of attainment in modern Italian choral composition, and it\r\nmay be considered the most valuable individual product of the Italian\r\nchoral revival.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                   IV\r\n\r\nTurning from Italy to Scandinavia, we find that in general little\r\ncreative work is done in the choral forms at the present day.\r\nIn Finland, as in Denmark, the cantata after the Handelian or\r\nMendelssohnian model is still in vogue. Even Sibelius has done little\r\nin the way of choral writing--only a ‘Festival Cantata’ and some\r\nchoruses; nor has anything of importance been written in Norway in this\r\ngenre since the death of Grieg; while oratorio, though largely given in\r\nconcert in Sweden, has not stimulated original composition.\r\n\r\nIn Russia more has been done. The Neo-Russians turn more naturally\r\nto symphonic and operatic composition than to the choral forms, and\r\nalthough quite a few of the great contemporaries are identified with\r\nchoral compositions, collectively there has not been a great deal\r\nwritten, with the exception of music for the liturgic services of the\r\nGreek Catholic Church, to which Tschaikowsky, Bortniansky, and others\r\nhave made notable contributions. This liturgic music does not call for\r\nconsideration here, as it is discussed elsewhere. The folk-music of\r\nRussia, which plays such a prominent part as thematic material in the\r\nworks of the Neo-Russian school, is chorally more identified with the\r\noperatic vocal ensemble, which is also outside the scope of the present\r\nchapter.\r\n\r\nThe original choral compositions of contemporary Russia stand high,\r\nqualitatively. Moussorgsky is represented by his virile ‘Destruction\r\nof Sennacherib’ (1866) for chorus and orchestra, and a choral number\r\nfrom his opera, _Salâmmbo_, revised, polished and enlarged as a chorus\r\nfor mixed voices and solo under the title of ‘Joshua,’ one of the few\r\nof the composer’s works which show a strong Oriental flavor. Nor has\r\nRimsky-Korsakoff, the friend and editor of Moussorgsky, written much\r\nmore. There is a cantata for tenor, bass, male chorus and orchestra,\r\n‘The Doom of Olga’ (Newcastle-on-Tyne, 1909); another, _Switezianka_,\r\nfor soprano, tenor, chorus and orchestra, a cantata entitled\r\n_Doubmouchka_ and a ‘Gloria’ for orchestra and chorus; as well as\r\nfifteen folk-songs arranged for mixed voices.\r\n\r\nGlazounoff, the symphonist, a pupil of Rimsky-Korsakoff, is the author,\r\njointly with Liadow, of a cantata in memory of the celebrated Russian\r\nsculptor Antokolsky, for tenor solo, chorus and orchestra, written\r\nafter his defection from the ranks of the national school; and Liadow\r\nhimself has set forty-five folk-songs for female voices and composed a\r\nmusical setting, for mixed voices and orchestra, of the last scene from\r\nSchiller’s ‘Bride of Messina.’\r\n\r\nArensky has given us a fine choral number--‘The Fountain of\r\nBachtchissarai,’ after a Pushkin poem, for solo voices, chorus and\r\norchestra; while Rachmaninoff’s spirited and plastically written choral\r\nballad, ‘Springtide,’ after a poem by Nekrassoff, composed in 1901\r\nfor dramatic baritone, mixed chorus and orchestra, has already been\r\nheard in this country. A new choral work by Rachmaninoff, set to E.\r\nA. Poe’s poem ‘The Bells,’ was given at Petrograd in the recent past\r\nwith great success. Glière has to his credit a choral suite for female\r\nvoices, with the four seasons as its textual basis; Ippolitoff-Ivanoff\r\nhas written three cantatas, Oriental in coloring, each in memory of a\r\nRussian poet; Akimenko has composed choruses for mixed voices; Georges\r\nCatoire for female voices; and Alexander Tanejew has set two groups of\r\ntwelve poems each, for four and five-part chorus respectively, while\r\nhis better-known nephew, Sergius Ivanovitch, who died this year in\r\nPetrograd (1915), is the composer of a cantata, ‘St. John of Damascus’\r\n(1884). Stravinsky, too, has a cantata to his credit, composed in 1911,\r\nand this practically completes the tale of contemporary Russian choral\r\ncomposition.\r\n\r\nIn concluding this study of contemporary choral music there only remain\r\nto be mentioned, in Poland, Felix Nowowiejski, author of several\r\n‘concert-dramas,’ ‘The Prodigal Son’ (1901), ‘The Discovery of the Holy\r\nCross’ (1906) and _Quo Vadis_ (1907)--rich in theatrical effect; and in\r\nHungary, Mauritius Vavrineoz, with an oratorio, _Christus_. In Spain\r\nand Portugal choral music, in the modern sense of the word, is hardly\r\nwritten. Felipe Pedrell’s dramatic cantata _Comte Arnau_, a score\r\ndistinctly modern in style and treatment, and Grignón’s _La Nit de\r\nNadal_, for chorus, solos and orchestra, are about the only ones that\r\ncome to mind.\r\n\r\n\r\n                              FOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[90] Schering: _Geschichte des Oratoriums_, p. 546.\r\n\r\n[91] Romain Rolland: _Musiciens d’Aujourd’hui_, Paris.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER XIV\r\n\r\n           THE ORGAN FROM THE EARLIEST TIMES TO THE PRESENT\r\n\r\n     The ancestor of the modern organ; pneumatic and hydraulic\r\n     organs of classical antiquity--The organ in early mediæval\r\n     times--The tenth and eleventh centuries: cloister and minster\r\n     organs; the twelfth and thirteenth centuries: introduction\r\n     of the ‘portative’ organ and balanced keys; the fourteenth\r\n     century: chromatic keyboard; pedals; organ blowing--Fifteenth\r\n     and sixteenth centuries; cathedral and church organs;\r\n     the _Rückpositiv_; the Spanish _partida_; builders--The\r\n     seventeenth century: mechanical development; tuning;\r\n     union of manuals; the eighteenth century: the ‘Swell’;\r\n     English builders; the Silbermanns--_Rococo_ adornment of\r\n     cases; the nineteenth century and the birth of the modern\r\n     instrument--Pneumatic action; electric action; the Universal\r\n     Air Chest; duplex stop control; tonal improvements--The\r\n     chamber organ; the concert organ; conclusion.\r\n\r\n\r\nFar back in the mist of ages some primal prototype of civilized man\r\nfound that by blowing a hollow reed he produced a pleasing sound. This\r\nwas probably the first step in the long process of evolution which\r\nhas resulted in the concert organ of to-day. From the single reed of\r\nantediluvian times to the grouped reeds of the dawn of history was a\r\nlogical transition; the early peoples of the Orient, the Egyptians, the\r\nIndians and the Chinese had accomplished it; but classical antiquity\r\nis, perhaps, our most definite point of contact, and it might be said\r\nthat the bucolic Pan’s pipes or Syrinx of the Theocritan shepherd is\r\nthe ancestor of the ‘king of instruments.’\r\n\r\nThe _Syrinx_ of pastoral Greece consisted of a series of reeds (tubes)\r\nwithout sound-holes, of graduated length and blown across the ends,\r\neach tube giving forth one note of the diatonic scale. In the course\r\nof time men hit upon the idea of allowing a bellows to take the place\r\nof the human lungs and thus produce sound by artificial instead of\r\nnatural wind-pressure. Hence, even before the second century B. C. we\r\nhave the first pneumatic organ--a series of variously tuned pipes, with\r\nmouthpieces, placed upon a box or chest, into which the air was pumped\r\nby bellows, the pipes sounding when the player opened the primitive\r\nvalves which admitted the air to each pipe.\r\n\r\nFollowing the pneumatic came the hydraulic organ, in which\r\nwater-pressure[92] took the place of wind-pressure. The invention of\r\nthis _organon hydraulicon_ is ascribed to the Alexandrian mechanician\r\nKtesibos, who flourished during the second century B. C. The\r\ndescription[93] left of the instrument by the inventor’s pupil Heron\r\nhas been corroborated in its essentials by the discovery of a small\r\nbaked clay model of an hydraulic organ, found in the ruins of Carthage\r\nin 1885 and preserved in the _Musée Lavigérie_ at Carthage. This model,\r\n7-1/16 by 2-3/4 inches (which it is estimated would represent an actual\r\ninstrument 10 feet high and 4 feet across), was made by the potter\r\nPossessoris, whose name is engraved on it, about 120 A. D., and is\r\nimportant as verifying the fact that a primitive keyboard was in use at\r\nthe beginning of our era.\r\n\r\nIt is clear that both forms of the organ, pneumatic and hydraulic,\r\nexisted side by side for centuries--the hydraulic principle being\r\nbest adapted to the construction of large instruments, powerful in\r\ntone, for permanent placing in amphitheatre, palace or coliseum, and\r\nthe pneumatic better suited to smaller ones, easily carried about\r\nand enjoying, perhaps, a more general popularity. The stationary and\r\nmoveable organs of the Roman empire thus anticipate the ‘positive’ and\r\n‘portative’ instruments of a later day.\r\n\r\nYet it is the hydraulic organ which is principally associated with the\r\npalmy days of Roman imperial rule. Though the poet Cornelius Severus\r\n(28 B. C.) celebrates the organ (_cortina_) which, ‘so rich in its\r\nvaried strains under the master’s skill, with liquid sound makes music\r\nin the vast theatre,’ evidence tends to prove that the Romans were,\r\nmusically, not a highly advanced people--their ideal was quantity and\r\nloudness of sound rather than quality, an ideal which the hydraulic\r\norgan might realize better than the pneumatic. Hence the _organon\r\nhydraulicon_, or _hydraulus_, was a luxury in vogue among the wealthy\r\npatricians of the empire. Nero, whose musical attainments history views\r\nwith such grave suspicion, possessed two hydraulic organs. That they\r\nwere heard in the Coliseum we know by the testimony of Petronius, the\r\n_arbiter elegantiarum_ of Nero’s Augustinian circle, who speaks of\r\ngladiators struggling to the sound of the water-organ. It is strange\r\nto note that among later Roman emperors the depraved and degenerate\r\nHeliogabalus (A. D. 219-222) and his immediate successor, the good and\r\nnoble Alexander Severus, were both good performers on the water-organ.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                   I\r\n\r\nWith the universal spread of the Christian faith the organ found its\r\nway into the service of the Church, and even during the decline of the\r\nempire and the dawn of western civilization the art of organ-building\r\nnever altogether died out. And this, despite the fact that originally\r\nthe instrument had come under the ban of the Church because of its\r\nheritage of evil associations with the gladiatorial combats, saturnalia\r\nand theatrical representations of Pagan Rome; possibly, also, because\r\nthe emperor Julian the Apostate was the owner of a fine _hydraulus_.\r\nYet this prejudice was ere long overcome, for the Spanish bishop,\r\nJulianus, in the fifth century, asserts that organs were commonly used\r\nin the churches throughout Spain.\r\n\r\nAnd such is the esteem in which the finer examples of the builder’s art\r\nare held that they are considered a gift fit for kings. The Emperor\r\nKonstantine Kopronymus presents one to Pepin, king of the Franks, in\r\nthe year 757; and another Byzantine emperor sends one to Charlemagne in\r\n812, of which the chronicle says: ‘Its bellows were of hide, its pipes\r\nof bronze, its tones as loud as thunder and sweet as the sound of lyre\r\nand psaltery.’ A pneumatic organ (as distinct from the hydraulic one\r\ninstalled in his palace) was secured by the son of Charlemagne, Louis\r\nle Debonnaire, for the royal chapel at Aix-la-Chapelle. And before\r\nthe tenth century the use of the organ in church and monastery was\r\nwell-nigh universal. Three treatises on organ-building written during\r\nthe tenth century testify to the fact. No doubt these early hydraulic\r\ninstruments had stops of some kind, but if so, their secret has\r\nperished with them.\r\n\r\nThe tenth century (as well as the eleventh) was one of great activity\r\nin organ-building. Numerous small organs were made in France, England\r\nand Germany for use in cloister schools, where they supported the\r\nsinging of the Gregorian melodies. They usually consisted of a series\r\nof from eight to, at the most, twenty-two pipes, tuned in the scale\r\nof C major, from the tenor C upward. The pipes resembled the modern\r\ndiapasons in construction and stood behind a species of manual with\r\nsmall keys (upright at first, but later horizontal) which allowed the\r\nwind to enter the pipes when they were pressed down. Into these organs\r\nthe wind was pumped by bellows and water-power was not used to regulate\r\nthe pressure.\r\n\r\nThe passion for cathedral building which had broken out even before\r\nthis time conditioned the building of great organs in keeping with\r\nthe size and splendor of the ministers. These large organs were all\r\nbuilt on the hydraulic principle. In England we find a monster organ\r\n(described in verse by St. Wolstan) installed in Bishop Alphege’s\r\nchurch at Winchester about 980 A. D. It had four hundred pipes of\r\nbronze, twenty-six bellows and two manuals (for two players) of twenty\r\nkeys (or rather levers) each, every key governing ten pipes. These\r\npipes were probably tuned in octaves of different pitch or, perhaps,\r\nwith fifths. The instrument required the services of some seventy\r\nmen to pump the wind! William of Malmesbury mentions ‘a fair organ\r\nwith pipes of copper, mounted in gilded frames,’ which St. Dunstan\r\npresented to his monastery in the chronicler’s native town. And in\r\nthe _Vita S. Oswaldi_ we are informed that the Saxon Earl Elwin gave\r\nthe Convent of Ramsay an organ of spiral form, having copper pipes,\r\nwhich ‘on feast-days emitted a sweet melodie and a clangour resounding\r\na long way.’ Large organs were also installed in Cologne, and in the\r\nchurches and monasteries of many other German and French cities during\r\nthis century. The ‘clangour’ of the Ramsay organ mentioned by the\r\nchronicler we may take for granted, for in these instruments no special\r\ndistinction of tone-quality was sought, power and sonority being the\r\nfirst essentials.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                   II\r\n\r\nPrior to the tenth and eleventh centuries, with their monster\r\ninstruments, the organ had been comparatively easy to play. But with\r\nthe enormous increase in size and a correspondingly complicated\r\nmechanism the organist had to be somewhat of an athlete, so great was\r\nthe actual physical exertion required to depress the broad levers which\r\nproduced the tone (no actual keyboard existed before 1200 A. D.).[94]\r\nThe clenched fist was used and originated the mediæval term _organum\r\npulsare_, to ‘beat’ the organ. During this century and the succeeding\r\none the compass of the organ was enlarged from one to three octaves,\r\nand progress in organ-building was also made in other directions.\r\n\r\nIn the twelfth century the pipes were first divided into registers and\r\nstops, and the small ‘portative’ organs, easily carried, came into\r\nuse. Not until a hundred years later did the balanced keys, _depressa\r\nlamina_, a genuine keyboard, appear in connection with the portative\r\norgans, and in the fourteenth century their use was general in the\r\nlarger organs as well. Before the introduction of the keyboard, the\r\nperformer had ‘beaten’ levers or pulled out stop-like sliders to\r\nproduce the tone, and the great exertion entailed by the ‘beating’ of\r\nthe levers in the great organs is supposed to have led to the invention\r\nof ‘mixtures’ some time after 1300.\r\n\r\nThe fourteenth century also offers the first instance of the use of a\r\nchromatic keyboard, that of the organ at Halberstadt, built in 1361\r\nand restored in 1495, in which an inscription on the keyboard states\r\nthat it formed part of the original organ, which had the semi-tonal\r\narrangement of keys. During this century organ-building received a\r\ntemporary check owing to both the Greek and Roman churches declaring\r\nagainst the use of the instrument in public worship. It was soon\r\nrestored in the Roman Church, but has never been reintroduced in the\r\nGreek.\r\n\r\n\r\n             [Illustration: Handel’s Organ in Whitchurch]\r\n                       _From a photograph_\r\n\r\n\r\nDuring the fourteenth century the ‘positives’ and ‘regals,’[95]\r\nsmall stationary organs, were perfected; and the organ pedals, said\r\nto have been invented by Ludwig van Valbeke, an organist of Brabant,\r\nabout 1300, were first introduced. The change from broad to narrow\r\nand more easily played keys in the larger organs is also supposed\r\nto have taken place at this time. The ‘blowers’ of these days, and\r\nfor centuries to come, however, did not have an easy time of it. In\r\nmany of the large organs the wind was pumped by continual shifting\r\nof weights of lead or stone. This was not the case with the bellows\r\nat Magdeburg and Halberstadt. Here each blower manipulated two heavy\r\nbellows, pressing down the upper plate of one while he raised the other\r\nwith a foot shod with an iron shoe. These blowers were appropriately\r\nenough termed ‘tramplers.’ Another method of pumping was in use in the\r\nSeville Cathedral up to comparatively recent times. Here the blower\r\nwalked continually from one to the other end of a fifteen-foot plank,\r\non the principle of a see-saw, alternately raising and depressing the\r\nfeeders as he reached either end. The ‘portatives’ of this time usually\r\nconsisted of a small wind-chest between two standards, planted with two\r\nranks of keys, of eight pipes each, and with a clavier of eight flat\r\ndiatonic keys, with single bellows like the ordinary domestic article.\r\nThe smaller ‘portatives’ may be said to have furnished the reed stops\r\nfor the organ proper.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                   III\r\n\r\nIn the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries organs of great beauty and\r\nvariety of tone, and rich in external adornment (there is a legend of\r\nan organ with pipes of pure silver erected by Philip II, king of Spain,\r\nin the _Escorial_), were built throughout Europe, the Germans enjoying\r\nthe greatest reputation as builders. In France (Amiens Cathedral,\r\nChurch of St. Bernard of Comminges, Chartres Cathedral); in Italy\r\n(Basilica di San Petronio, Bologna; Orvieto Cathedral, Church of St.\r\nJohn Lateran); in Spain (cathedrals of Salamanca, Zaragoza, Tarragona,\r\nBarcelona), and in Germany (churches and minsters in Vienna, Erfurt,\r\nBrunswick, Strassburg, Salzburg, Bamberg, Nürnberg) are still to be\r\nfound organs and cases which excite admiration. In England small\r\norgans were principally used in the churches during the fifteenth\r\ncentury, though toward its close and during the sixteenth larger organs\r\nwere imported from the Continent. During the sixteenth century the\r\n_Rückpositiv_ (back positive), a small portable organ for liturgic\r\nceremonies, located at the organist’s back and communicating with a\r\nkeyboard in the principal organ by means of trackers running under his\r\nfeet, was invented and used until well into the nineteenth century,\r\nespecially in France.\r\n\r\nA curious feature of the sixteenth-century cathedral organ of Spain,\r\nand one which influenced Spanish religious composition, was the\r\n_partida_, or division. All the stops were divided into two groups,\r\neach one acting on half the keyboard, the stops on one side sounding\r\nin the treble half, those on the other in the bass. Thus a Spanish\r\ncathedral organ with 120 stops in reality controlled only 60 sets\r\nof pipes. Compositions for these organs were called _partidas_, one\r\nhand playing full organ with all the reeds, the other using only flue\r\nstops. The part written for full organ was always _glosada_, or rich in\r\nbrilliant passage-work and ornamentation. Organ builders in the earlier\r\ndays were usually monks and priests, as all creative cultural activity\r\nwas then concentrated in the church and especially in the monasteries.\r\nDuring the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries the lay builder, in\r\ncontrast to the ecclesiastic, makes his appearance.\r\n\r\nAmong these builders were, in England: William Wotton, who flourished\r\nin 1487, Chamberlyn (1509), Duddyington (1519), Perrot (1526) and White\r\n(1531); in Germany: Compenius, Schnitzker, Hildebrandt, Schmid, André,\r\nKranz, Lobsinger, and the Trampeli; in Italy: the Attengnati family,\r\nLorenzo di Giacomo, Luca Blasi, Vincenzo Columbi. It may be said that\r\nduring the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries the organ assumed a form\r\nwhose essentials--plurality of keyboards (manuals) and wind-chests,\r\narrangement of stop action and pedals--have remained unchanged during\r\nsucceeding centuries. Interesting as an incident in the development\r\nof the increasing secular use of the instrument is its introduction\r\n(in the smaller form) in the orchestra of Peri’s _Euridice_ (1600),\r\nthe first opera, in which _un regalo_ and _Duoi organi di legno_\r\n(portatives with wooden pipes) were employed.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                   IV\r\n\r\nDuring the seventeenth century many mechanical devices intended to\r\nsecure rapidity, ease and precision in organ playing were invented or\r\nperfected. The custom of tuning the organ according to the ‘unequal\r\ntemperament,’ which made practicable the use of only sixteen keys,\r\npersisted throughout this century, and did not die out on the Continent\r\nuntil the next. The wind-gauge, invented in 1675 by Chr. F. Förner,\r\nwas important, as it made possible the proper regulation of the\r\nwind-power in the various wind-chests and in the registers above them.\r\nIn general, this century as well as that following are notable because\r\nof the addition of many new flute and reed-tone stops, and a general\r\nenrichment of the tone-color of the instrument; as well as the first\r\ngeneral application of a thoroughly modern idea, the union of several\r\ndistinct organs, each having a keyboard of its own, into one single\r\ninstrument, though more than one manual had been used before this.\r\n\r\nEarly in the eighteenth century the ‘swell’ is invented to vary the\r\nloudness of the organ tone, by an English organ-builder named Jordans\r\n(1712); and during the course of the century the softest sounding\r\nmanual in the majority of English organs (known as the ‘echo’) is\r\nchanged into a swell. On the other hand the pedal is practically\r\nunknown in England until the nineteenth century. Father Smith,\r\nThomas, René Harris and Avery were prominent English organ-builders\r\nof the eighteenth century, as well as Samuel Green, who invented the\r\nhorizontal bellows in 1789. The Silbermanns were the great German\r\nbuilders of the time, and from 1714 to 1817 various members of this\r\nfamily built remarkably fine organs, renowned for their tone quality\r\nand constructive excellence, in a number of German cities. One of the\r\nfinest of the Silbermann organs is that of the Freiberg minster, built\r\nby Gottfried, in 1714; another is that of the Catholic Royal Chapel in\r\nDresden.\r\n\r\nA curious development of the _rococo_ spirit of the age was the\r\namount of money spent on the tasteless external embellishment of the\r\ninstrument--angels posturing on the organ-cases, who by means of a\r\nmechanism beat kettle-drums and cymbals and blew trumpets, and ‘cymbal\r\nstars’ which jingled as they revolved on wires. Yet such errors in\r\njudgment represented no more than a temporary aberration of taste, and\r\nthe century as a whole is one of continual mechanical progress with\r\ncorresponding musical results.\r\n\r\nIt is in the nineteenth century, however, that the great advance\r\nin the mechanics of organ-building, which has culminated in the\r\npresent perfected instrument of to-day, begins. Cavaillé-Col (b.\r\n1811) introduced separate wind-chests, with varying pressures for the\r\nhigher, middle and lower parts of the keyboard, and added _flutes\r\noctaviantes_ to the register. In 1832 C. S. Barker (England) invented\r\ncomposition pedals, making easier the handling of groups of stops,\r\nand the pneumatic lever. And, finally, with the improvements of H. W.\r\nWillis and the electro-pneumatic action of Péschard (1866) (electricity\r\nhad already been applied to the key-action by Dr. Gauntlett in 1850),\r\nthe history of the ancient organ comes to an end and that of the modern\r\ninstrument begins.\r\n\r\n      F. H. M.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                   V\r\n\r\nThe processes by which the organ has developed from its clumsy\r\nprototypes to the magnificent yet sensitive and delicate instrument\r\nof to-day are parallel to those to be found in other products of\r\nman’s ingenuity. Practical science has contributed step by step to\r\nthis evolution, and no one can understand the modern organ who is not\r\nfamiliar with the latest inventions of electro-pneumatics.\r\n\r\nThe first step was the introduction of pneumatic mechanism to open the\r\npallets in the old open slide chests, thus equalizing the touch of the\r\nkey-action. This also made it possible to greatly increase the number\r\nof stops served by a single pallet. The next problem was to avoid\r\nincreasing the weight of the key-touch when the couplers were drawn,\r\nand this was accomplished by an extension of the pneumatic system in\r\nthe key-desk, which in this case was connected by action-tubing to the\r\nchests. The resulting combination of an entirely pneumatic key-action\r\nwith the pneumatic operation of the pallets constituted tubular\r\npneumatic action.\r\n\r\nAn improved form of chest was at this time constructed in which each\r\nstop was supplied with wind separately and the single pallet for each\r\nnote was replaced by a small pneumatic valve for each pipe of each\r\nstop on the chest. Hilborne L. Roosevelt and C. S. Haskell developed\r\nthis system (1885) and at first employed it in connection with tracker\r\nkey-action. Many an old organ of this type is in perfect condition\r\nto-day. Most American organs contain chests built on this plan, with\r\ncountless modifications. Among its advantages are greater steadiness\r\nof wind, and independent control of the wind as it enters each\r\nstop-chamber. The latter feature is closely related in its operation to\r\nthe French ventils by which whole sections of stops are cut off from\r\nthe wind at the player’s will. Thus the modern organ combines tubular\r\npneumatic action with pneumatic chests, as practically all chests,\r\nwhether open or individual, are pneumatic in their operation.\r\n\r\nAn important advance must be credited to Mr. Roosevelt, in the\r\norigination of adjustable combination action, which was applied by him\r\nin 1882.\r\n\r\nIt is impossible to record adequately the revolution which the use of\r\nelectricity has wrought in organ building. In 1886 Henry Willis erected\r\na large four-manual electric organ in Canterbury Cathedral, where the\r\nstorage batteries filled a good-sized room (which was the old singing\r\nschool room), and their amperage was enormous. The successful audacity\r\nof this achievement deserves recognition. Here was a large key desk\r\nplaced behind the choir stalls, and connected only by cables, 120 feet\r\nlong, with the organ, which was entirely concealed in the Triforium.\r\nThis is exactly what has become a commonplace in the organ of to-day.\r\nThe progress of electricity has, however, enabled us to use much\r\nsmaller magnets, and to apply their action to the pneumatic chests with\r\ngreat simplicity. For it must be remembered that so-called electric\r\norgans merely add electrical control to the existing pneumatic action\r\nof the pipe valves. In some organs this element is proportionately\r\nquite small, in others it is very large; but in any case the chest\r\naction is pneumatic.\r\n\r\nIn one form of chest the action, while electro-pneumatic and designed\r\nto control each stop separately, is exposed and constitutes the\r\nceiling of a highly developed modern open chest. Though originated\r\nby Randebrock, the chief credit for this combination of the two\r\nfundamental systems of chest structure is due to John T. Austin (1895).\r\nHe has named it the ‘Universal Air Chest.’\r\n\r\nThe separate stop-chest made it possible to operate a stop from\r\nmore than one keyboard, or at more than one octave, a process which\r\nis called duplex, multiple or unit stop control. Noted builders\r\nare applying the idea in great variety. The principle is not new.\r\nIt was brought out in Belgium by L. Dryvers, and described by H.\r\nV. Couwenbergh in 1887. One of his schemes comprised an organ of\r\nsix units, from which a three-manual organ of forty-six registers\r\nwas formed. For instance, a Bourdon stop of 104 pipes yielded ten\r\nregisters, of the following variety of nomenclature--_Bourdon_,\r\n_Sous-Basse_, _Flûte Bouchée_, _Flûte Douce_, _Flûte Champêtre_. The\r\ningenious prophet, however, added to this scheme a _Récit_ organ\r\nof eleven absolutely separate solo stops, built on the _système\r\nordinaire_, and expressive, thereby showing a commendable sense of the\r\nweakness of his own system!\r\n\r\nAll modern organs employ the principle of duplex mechanism to some\r\nextent, and, legitimately used, it is of enormous value. The example\r\ngiven above is the _reductio ad absurdam_ of the idea, and also\r\nindicates the deceptive habit of renaming the stops thus derived.\r\n\r\nThe success of the modern organ has depended in large measure on the\r\nuse of really effective swell chambers. Not only are they effective,\r\nbut the proportion of stops that are enclosed has been greatly\r\nincreased. The organ has thereby been liberated from its old lack of\r\nflexibility. We even find two expressive divisions playable from one\r\nmanual. An interesting adaptation of this idea is the grouping of all\r\nthe stops of each tone family in separate swell chambers. This has been\r\ndone on some large concert organs, as well as on those of the unit\r\ntype. Mention must here be made of the conspicuous service rendered by\r\nRobert Hope-Jones both in his insistence on effective expression, with\r\nthe stops arranged in ‘families’ of tone, and in his advocacy of the\r\nunit organ. However, he was often obliged to modify his own theories in\r\npractice. He was the first to leather the lips of Diapason pipes.\r\n\r\nTonally, the modern organ has also made great strides. It cannot be\r\nsaid that voicers are more skillful in their art, nor that the quality\r\nof the materials used is better than in the past. We must, however,\r\nnote the great advantage of being able to supply and control wind of\r\nany pressure desired in the modern wind chest. It is quite common to\r\nvoice the chorus solo reeds on a wind pressure of twenty-five inches,\r\nfor which the scales used, the thickness and weight of the metal, and\r\nthe voicing, are greatly modified. The Diapasons and Flutes have not\r\nchanged so much as the chorus and solo reeds, and the stops of string\r\ntone. Artistic voicing has completely changed the character of these\r\nstops, and has adjusted itself to the new conditions of expression. A\r\nfew men have achieved fame in this direction, though their work has not\r\nalways received the recognition it deserves. Among them were George and\r\nCharles Englefried and others, whose work was found on many Roosevelt\r\norgans; John W. Whiteley, of the English family of organ builders;\r\nand W. E. Haskell, whose development of string tones and especially\r\nthe allied flue stops of reed character has attracted attention. The\r\ninventions of Robert Hope-Jones have given a great stimulus to the\r\nhigh-pressure reeds, and he also introduced the Diaphone (1894).\r\nAmong American builders the names of George S. Hutchings, Hilborne L.\r\nRoosevelt and Ernest M. Skinner are conspicuous for their high ideals\r\nin artistic voicing, while in Europe the noble instruments constructed\r\nby Henry Willis and Aristide Cavaillé-Coll are most conspicuous.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                   VI\r\n\r\nNo account of the modern organ would be complete without reference to\r\nthree new developments of the instrument. Its origin and traditions are\r\necclesiastical, but our civilization has at first hesitatingly, and\r\nnow boldly, appropriated the organ for other uses. It was introduced\r\ninto various private residences, and the resulting type is known as\r\nthe Chamber Organ. Then, particularly in England, it was employed as a\r\nmeans of public instruction and entertainment in town halls and other\r\npublic buildings. Notable examples are the organs at Liverpool (St.\r\nGeorge’s Hall), London (Albert Hall, etc.), and Sydney, N. S. W. These\r\ninstruments are known as Concert Organs.

Moreover,\r\nastute theatrical managers have seized on this favorite kind of\r\nentertainment and are featuring organs in the theatre. There is no\r\nsettled form of theatre scheme, but the process of evolution is going\r\non, and worthy instruments are being constructed for this purpose.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately this development has resulted in the construction\r\nof numerous hybrid instruments. The bewildering possibilities of\r\nduplication have led to the installation of concert instruments with no\r\nindependent pedal foundation and with additional manuals which, instead\r\nof preserving their own character, control only a rearrangement of\r\nstops already perfectly accessible. The tendency to let mere mechanism\r\nreplace independent tones is most flagrantly displayed in this class of\r\ninstruments.\r\n\r\nThere is no doubt that the organ is now beginning to ‘find itself.’\r\nThe organ of the future will be as much like an organ as ever--only\r\nmore so, if possible! We shall still regard mechanism as a means to\r\nan end, and not as an end in itself. We shall insist on simplicity\r\nof control, at the key desk, however vast and sonorous the tonal\r\nappointments. Finally, we shall honor and encourage the master voicers\r\nin their efforts to use the best methods of the past, and to adapt them\r\nto the new mechanical conditions. For in the last analysis the sense to\r\nwhich the organ makes its true appeal is not that of touch, through the\r\nplayer’s fingers, nor that of sight, through the impressive appearance\r\nof tracery and noble towers of pipes, but that of hearing, for the\r\near is the most marvellous acoustic instrument ever conceived and is\r\ncapable of appreciating the most refined as well as the noblest organ\r\ntones.\r\n\r\n      R.

Here water flowing from one\r\njar to another, through the medium of a cross-channel, forced the\r\nair through a whistle set over the mouth of the second jar, with a\r\nresulting musical note. The inverse tipping of the jar drew in the air\r\nagain through the whistle.\r\n\r\n[93] Vitruvius, the Roman engineer and architect, who lived in the\r\nreign of Augustus, has also described the hydraulic organ of Ktesibos\r\nin his _De Arch._ lib.

The earliest\r\nexisting information we possess regarding organists and organ-playing\r\ncomes from Italy and reaches far back into the fourteenth century.\r\nFrancesco Landino (1325-1390) of Florence is the first celebrated\r\nrepresentative of Italian organists’ art. A contemporary writer gives\r\nthe following enthusiastic account of his playing: ‘The whole assembly\r\nis excited by his organ-playing, the young dance and sing, the old hum\r\nwith him; all are enchanted. He draws wonders from the little organ;\r\nthe birds cease their song and in their astonishment draw near to\r\nlisten.’[96]\r\n\r\nThe instrument with which Landino produced such astonishing effects\r\nand gained such a reputation was not the church organ (_organum\r\nmagnum_), which was altogether too clumsy, but the little house organ,\r\nprobably the ‘portative’ organ, called _ninfale_ in Italy (see Chapter\r\nXIV). In the Library of St. Lorenzo at Florence is a miniature which\r\nrepresents Landino seated, playing on a _ninfale_ which rests on his\r\nknees. He was called _Il Cieco_ from the fact that he was blind, and\r\nhis great skill as a performer gave him the name Francesco _degli\r\nOrgani_. He was generally recognized as the most prominent organist and\r\nmusician of his time, and, as he was of noble family and grew up in an\r\natmosphere of culture and refinement, it is not astonishing to find\r\nthat he was not less celebrated as a philosopher and poet. None of his\r\ncompositions for the organ have been preserved; probably most of his\r\nplaying was improvisation, as his infirmity would render it difficult\r\nfor him to make use of the imperfect notation of his time. Several of\r\nhis vocal works have come down to us, however, and Fétis considered\r\nthem far in advance of the art of his period.\r\n\r\nThere were, of course, many organists before Landino, but none of them\r\nseem to have gained any special excellence in the practice of their\r\nart. Until about the time of Landino the professions of organ-playing\r\nand organ-building, certainly as far as church-music was concerned,\r\nseem to have been more commonly than otherwise combined in the same\r\nperson. But after Landino organ-playing became more of a specialized\r\ndepartment of musical art. Early in the next century Antonio\r\nSguarcialupo achieved much fame for his performances and in 1435 was\r\nappointed organist at the newly-dedicated Cathedral of Santa Maria at\r\nFlorence. He was of noble birth and was a man of refined and scholarly\r\nattainments. He evidently held the double position of church organist\r\nand court organist to Lorenzo the Magnificent, and his playing was so\r\nexceptional that it attracted people to Florence from far and near to\r\nlisten to it. Lorenzo treated him as a friend, and so highly did he\r\nesteem him that at his death he wrote a sonnet eulogizing the musician,\r\nin which Death is made to say, ‘I have taken him in order that Heaven\r\nmay be made more joyful with his music.’ No compositions of his for\r\neither organ or voices have come down to us, but he left a valuable\r\ncollection of older Italian compositions, thirteen in number, the only\r\nexisting examples of Italian musical art of that far-off time. This\r\ncollection is now in the Library of St. Lorenzo in Florence.\r\n\r\nThe Netherlanders, who were the musical masters of Europe during this\r\nperiod, were the founders of the first real school of organ-playing\r\nin Italy. The two men who gave this movement its first impetus and\r\ndirection were Adrian Willaert (about 1480-1562), who was _maestro\r\ndi cappella_ of St. Mark’s at Venice from 1527 till his death, and\r\nJacques Buus (born in Flanders about 1510), who was second organist at\r\nSt. Mark’s from 1541 to 1551. They cultivated with special zeal and\r\npreference the so-called _ricercare_, one of the most important of the\r\nearly instrumental forms. Willaert’s creative interest naturally lay\r\nmore in the direction of composing for the fine choral establishment\r\nwhich St. Mark’s maintained, but Buus seems to have made at least the\r\nbeginning of a type of instrumental music that was conceived for the\r\norgan and not merely transcribed from vocal music, thus paving the way\r\nfor real organ music.\r\n\r\nFor a better understanding of early organ music it will be\r\nnecessary here to describe briefly some of the most important and\r\nfrequently-employed instrumental forms of the period. The earliest\r\nuse of the organ in the church service was merely to strengthen the\r\nvoice parts by duplication. When the organ was developed sufficiently\r\nto be used alone for artistic playing, the organist merely played\r\nwell-known motets and other church compositions and sometimes even\r\nfavorite secular madrigals and _chansons_. For a long time these\r\nwere purely transcriptions of the choral parts with no attempt at\r\nvariation and many of the compositions of the period were frankly\r\nwritten ‘either to be sung or played.’ Little by little organists\r\nventured to introduce free passages of their own to embellish the\r\nvoice parts, but such compositions remained essentially choral works.\r\nThe _ricercare_ (from _ricercare_, ‘to search out’) was one of the\r\nearliest forms of strictly instrumental music, though the term was\r\nsometimes applied also to the madrigal.[97] It dates from early in the\r\nfifteenth century and was an elaborate and scholarly form into which\r\nevery known contrapuntal artifice and device was introduced, and which,\r\ntherefore, was least cultivated. Originally the _ricercare_ did not\r\nadhere to the same subject throughout, but, like the motet, progressed\r\nafter a short elaboration to a new subject. This lacked conciseness,\r\nwhich, however, was won in the seventeenth century when it assumed\r\npractically the same form as the simple fugue, and for a long time\r\nthese two terms were interchangeable. The _ricercare_ was sometimes in\r\nthe form of a _fantasia_ on some popular melody or song and in this way\r\nmany secular tunes crept into organ music as they had earlier found a\r\nsurreptitious place in the old masses. A somewhat later form was the\r\n_canzona Francese_, an invention borrowed from the French _chanson_,\r\ncontrapuntal in character but less elaborate than the _ricercare_ and\r\nfreed from pedantry. Its first three notes were almost invariably a\r\nquarter and two eighths, thus establishing a characteristic rhythmical\r\nmovement. Its song-like character made it a favorite form. The\r\n_toccata_ (from _toccare_, ‘to play’) was a third and still later form.\r\nThis required brilliant execution and was in the nature of a fantastic\r\nimprovisation to display the technical skill of the performer. Later it\r\nwas frequently employed to precede a fugue and was built largely on the\r\ndevelopment of a single figure.\r\n\r\nPieces called _intonazioni d’organo_ (‘Intonations’) were short\r\npreludes, from five to twenty measures long, in the nature of free\r\nimprovisations; they were used to precede the larger organ pieces in\r\nthe services of the Roman Church. The _fantasia_ was a form of very\r\nrespectable age, probably as old as the _ricercare_. It seems to have\r\nbeen descended from the accompanied madrigal, in which the instruments\r\nplayed the same parts with the voices. Hawkins in his History speaks of\r\nfantasias as abounding ‘in fugues and little responsive passages and\r\nall those elegances observable in the structure and contrivance of the\r\nmadrigal.’ Usually they were utterly free in form, differing radically\r\nfrom the more formal structure of later fantasias, such as those by\r\nMozart and Beethoven.\r\n\r\nSt. Mark’s at Venice was destined to play such a distinguished part\r\nin the development of organ-music that a word of historical comment\r\nwill here be appropriate. Venice was a republic until 1797, its\r\ngovernment being vested in the hands of a Doge, or Duke, and a Council\r\nmade up of representatives of the nobility. From very early times\r\nthis Council took the greatest pride in the music of the grand-ducal\r\nchapel, later known as St. Mark’s Cathedral (San Marco). As early as\r\n1318 they commissioned Zucchetti to build a new organ for the chapel\r\nand, when it was completed, appointed him organist and choir-master. A\r\nsecond organ was built about 1370 and the position of second organist\r\ncreated in 1389. These two positions were co-equal in duties, salary,\r\nand official importance and the organists, like the consuls of old\r\nRome, were supposed to be men of equal calibre. They were chosen with\r\nthe greatest care from many candidates after the stiffest kind of\r\nexamination conducted before the magistrates and St. Mark’s grew to be\r\none of the most coveted musical appointments in Europe. A _maestro di\r\ncappella_ was added to the two organists in 1491. His position was the\r\nmost important of the three and his salary[98] was larger than that of\r\nthe organists. He composed the special music, trained and conducted the\r\nchoirs and orchestra, and had general supervision over all the church\r\nmusic. This position became so important that later a second _maestro_\r\nwas appointed with rank and duties coordinate with the first. In these\r\npositions a long line of illustrious musicians served St. Mark’s for\r\nseveral centuries.\r\n\r\nOnce started in a new direction, the Italians soon took from the hands\r\nof their Netherland masters the development of this branch of the art\r\nand native organists began to write copiously for their instrument. In\r\naddition to Venice, Rome, Florence, Naples, Bologna, Parma, and many\r\nother Italian cities boasted of excellent musicians and organists who\r\nworked earnestly and enthusiastically for the advancement of the art of\r\norgan music. They did not employ counterpoint merely for its own sake,\r\nas did many of the Netherland masters, but imagination and feeling\r\nwere given consideration. Harmonically and melodically much progress\r\nwas also made and chromatic tones were much more freely and frequently\r\nbrought into use. The forms chiefly cultivated were those mentioned\r\nabove. Brief mention will be made of the more famous of these early\r\nmasters.\r\n\r\nClaudio Merulo (1533-1604) at the age of twenty-four was chosen out of\r\nten competitors to fill the position of second organist at St. Mark’s\r\nin Venice, and from 1566 to 1586 he was first organist there. One of\r\nthe greatest organists of his time, he is credited by Fétis with being\r\nthe first to write really independent compositions for the organ.\r\nHe wrote three volumes of _ricercari_ and _canzoni_ and two volumes\r\nof toccatas. His fame as composer rests chiefly on the fact that he\r\nadvanced the toccata-form. His reputation was overshadowed by the\r\ngreater genius of the two Gabrielis, who were associated with him at\r\nSt. Mark’s.\r\n\r\nAndrea Gabrieli (1510-1586), a pupil of Willaert and the successor of\r\nMerulo as second organist at St. Mark’s in 1566, was one of the most\r\neminent representatives of the brilliant Venetian school. He exerted\r\na large influence not only as composer and performer, but also as\r\nteacher. Among his distinguished pupils were his nephew Giovanni and\r\nthe German Hans Leo Hassler of Nuremberg. His organ works include\r\nchiefly _ricercari_, _canzoni_, and _intonazioni_. A characteristic\r\nwork of his is the _Fantasia allegra_, founded on a popular French\r\n_chanson_ by Crequillon, which is quoted by Ritter in his _Geschichte\r\ndes Orgelspiels_. It has three themes or subjects which are developed\r\nin the style of the _ricercare_. The second subject is a free\r\n‘inversion’ of the first and the third is formed from the second by\r\n‘diminution,’ with ornamentation in rapid passages.\r\n\r\nGiovanni Gabrieli (1557-1612), nephew and pupil of Andrea, was likewise\r\ncelebrated as organist, teacher, and composer. From 1575 to 1579 he\r\nwas at the court in Munich. In 1585 he succeeded Merulo as first\r\norganist at St. Mark’s, a position which he held until his death.\r\nHeinrich Schuetz and Michael Prætorius were among his famous pupils.\r\nAs composer he stood at the head of the Venetian school, being,\r\nlike his uncle, a great master of vocal forms and showing a special\r\npreference for compositions for double and triple chorus. For organ\r\nhe left preludes, a _toccata_, and several _ricercari_ and _canzoni_.\r\nA valuable and attractive work of his is the _Sonata pian e forte_\r\nin eight independent parts (quoted in Wasielewski’s _Geschichte der\r\nInstrumentalmusik_).\r\n\r\nThe two Gabrielis occupy a place of large importance in the early\r\ndevelopment of organ music and may be said to be the first real\r\norgan composers. Their _ricercari_ mark a distinct advance over\r\nthe compositions of their predecessors, especially in their fugal\r\nconstruction.\r\n\r\nGiovanni Pierluigi da Palestrina (1526-1594), _maestro di cappella_ of\r\nSt. Peter’s at Rome from 1571 until his death, and the greatest master\r\nof the unaccompanied polyphonic choral style, wrote some for the organ,\r\nincluding eight _ricercari_. The character of his music is quiet,\r\nserious, and dignified, contrasting favorably with the often dull and\r\nmeaningless _ricercari_ of the older Netherlanders. Wasielewski’s\r\nestimate of these older compositions is: ‘The impression they produce\r\nis essentially wearisome, dry, and monotonous. They are generally of\r\ngreat length and they sound like troubled, uneasy successions of notes,\r\nwanting in contrast of subjects and strength of ideas; the eye is more\r\nsatisfied than the ear.’[99]\r\n\r\nLuzzasco Luzzaschi (1545-1607) was organist of the Cathedral of\r\nFerrara. Merulo conferred upon him the title of ‘first organist of\r\nItaly.’ A good organ number is his Toccata in the fourth tone.\r\n\r\nGioseffo Guami (about 1550-1611) enjoyed an excellent reputation as\r\norganist and composer. He was organist first at Munich, then at St.\r\nMark’s, and finally at the cathedral in Lucca, his native town. His\r\n_canzona_ ‘_La Guamina_’ (quoted by Ritter) is a valuable composition\r\nand shows him as a master of form, gifted with refreshing inventive\r\npowers.\r\n\r\nGirolamo Diruta, born about 1560 at Perugia, was a pupil of Merulo and\r\norganist of the cathedral at Chioggia, near Venice. He was the author\r\nof a famous instruction book (published in 1597), ‘_Il Transilvano_’--a\r\ndialogue on the true method of playing organs: in which work a\r\nknowledge of everything connected with the keyboard is easily and\r\nrapidly taught. Also how to use the hands in Diminution (which means\r\nhere the ornamentation of a subject by rapid notes) and the method of\r\nunderstanding the Tablature, proving the truth and necessity of the\r\nrules given, by examples of Toccatas by divers excellent organists.\r\nA work newly made, most useful and necessary to professors of the\r\norgan.’ The book contains the following rules for playing the organ\r\n‘with gravity and ease.’ The organist must sit before the middle of the\r\nkeyboard and must not make unnecessary movements, but must hold himself\r\nupright and in graceful position. The fingers must be placed equally\r\nabove the keys, somewhat bent but not stiff; the fingers must press,\r\nnot strike, the keys. The scale is to be played by the fingers alone,\r\nwithout the thumb, which is to be used only in a _salto cattivo_ (that\r\nis, a leap from an accented to an unaccented note), thus:\r\n\r\n\r\n                      [Illustration: Music score]\r\n\r\n\r\nThe prejudice against the use of the thumb remained in force until\r\nSebastian Bach revolutionized the whole method of fingering by using\r\nthe thumb equally with the other fingers. _Il Transilvano_ also\r\ncontains some interesting directions for registration for the eight\r\necclesiastical modes, for example: ‘For the First Tone, which requires\r\nfull-sounding quality, the Double Open Diapason, the Open Diapason,\r\nand the Flute or Principal. To give expression to the melancholy\r\nfeeling of the Second Tone, the Double Open Diapason and Tremulant are\r\nrequired....’\r\n\r\nConstanzo Antegnati, born in Brescia in 1557, was an organist and\r\norgan-builder, as his ancestors had been for several generations. In\r\n1608 he published an instruction book called _L’Arte Organica_, which\r\nis of more than passing interest since it gives some insight into the\r\nsize and structure of contemporary organs, their tone-qualities and\r\nmode of playing. It would seem that Italian organ-builders did not\r\nstrive after variety of tone-quality, but built their instruments\r\nalmost exclusively of diapasons from 32-foot pitch to highest audible\r\npitch through octaves and fifths, with only a small proportion of flute\r\nstops and rarely a reed stop. The Italian organists seldom, if ever,\r\nchanged registration during performance. The effects which were then\r\nso much wondered at were produced more by dexterity of execution and\r\ncommand of counterpoint.\r\n\r\nGirolamo Frescobaldi (1583-1644), Italy’s greatest master of the organ\r\nand the most distinguished organist of the seventeenth century, was\r\nthe first to infuse expressive power into organ music. He was complete\r\nmaster of the contrapuntal and harmonic art of his period and his work\r\nbears the stamp of genius that would tolerate no rule, whether old or\r\nnew. ‘Understand me who can; I understand myself,’ he wrote as a motto\r\nover one of his works. So great was his fame, as Baini relates, that at\r\nhis first appearance at St. Peter’s in Rome in 1614 he had an audience\r\nof 30,000 listeners. The organ on which he played was an instrument of\r\nfourteen stops with one manual and a short-compass pedal-board. He was\r\norganist of St. Peter’s from 1614 until his death, except from 1628 to\r\n1633 when he was court-organist at Florence. Instrumental music was\r\nstill in a crude, formative period, yet his harmonies are frequently\r\nstartling in their boldness and romantic suggestion; his music shows\r\nalmost complete emancipation from the sway of ecclesiastical modes;\r\nand in the vigor and force of his subjects as well as in the freedom\r\nwith which he treated them and the expressive qualities he employed, he\r\nwas far in advance of his age. His contributions to organ literature\r\nwere numerous and important. They consisted of _ricercari_, _canzoni_,\r\n_toccatas_, and _capriccios_, many of which have been reprinted in\r\nmodern notation in various collections of old masters.[100] He was\r\ncareful to give very specific directions, many of which are exceedingly\r\ninteresting, as to just how he wished his compositions performed.\r\n\r\nThe culmination of Italian organ music was reached in Frescobaldi and\r\nthe supremacy in this field was soon transferred to Germany, whither\r\nzealous and gifted German students had carried the fruits of their\r\nItalian study. Very little progress was made in Italy, in either\r\norgan-playing or organ-building, from the time of Frescobaldi until\r\nnear the close of the nineteenth century, so completely was Italy under\r\nthe domination of the particular kind of opera so dearly prized by that\r\nmelody-loving country. A few important Italian names, however, remain\r\nto be mentioned.\r\n\r\nGiovanni Battista Fasolo, a Franciscan born at Asti, lived at Venice\r\nand was known mainly by a work (published in 1645) which supplied the\r\norganist with suitable material for the different services throughout\r\nthe whole church-year.\r\n\r\nGiovanni Battista Bassini (1657-1716), a famous violinist and organist,\r\nwas chapel-master of the Cathedral of Bologna from 1680 to 1685, when\r\nhe went to Ferrara. Of interest is his _Sonata da Organo_ in F, in\r\nwhich he makes use of the ‘circle of keys’ in modulating away from and\r\nback to the principal key.\r\n\r\nVincenzo Abrici (1631-1696) was born at Rome, but was converted to\r\nLutheranism and in 1664 was appointed chapel-master to the Elector of\r\nSaxony at Dresden, probably the only Italian Protestant organist of\r\nhis time. He wrote excellent church music and while at Dresden was the\r\nteacher of Kuhnau.\r\n\r\nBernardo Pasquini (1637-1710) was born in Tuscany and became the most\r\ncelebrated Italian organist of the second half of the seventeenth\r\ncentury, his fame spreading to many foreign countries. Most of his life\r\nwas spent at Rome where he was long organist at Santa Maria Maggiore,\r\nfrom which position he was elevated to a post that was evidently\r\ncreated especially for him--Organist of the Senate and People of Rome.\r\n\r\nDomenico Zipoli (born about 1675) was organist of the Jesuit Church at\r\nRome about 1716 and during his lifetime was recognized as one of the\r\nforemost composers for the organ. He published sonatas for organ and\r\ncembalo consisting of short pieces for ritual use. Several of these are\r\navailable in modern editions and, especially a Canzona in G minor and a\r\nPastorale in C major, are pleasing enough to have been written by Bach\r\nor Handel.\r\n\r\nPadre Giambattista Martini (1706-1784), a celebrated theorist and\r\nhistorian, published in 1738 sonatas for the organ and cembalo, which\r\nwere sets of short pieces hardly suitable for church use. He was\r\nconsidered the highest authority on theoretical matters and was always\r\nready to help and encourage young musical talent. His Gavotte in F\r\n(from one of the above sonatas) has often figured on popular organ\r\nprograms.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                   II\r\n\r\nOrgan-playing in Germany was nearly a century later in starting\r\nits serious development than in Italy. As the first impetus to the art\r\nin Italy came from foreign sources--from the Netherlanders Willaert\r\nand Buus who had settled in Venice--so the first definite stimulus\r\nin the development of German organ-playing came from Italy and the\r\nNetherlands, where the art had already reached a higher plane of\r\ndevelopment. Amsterdam and Venice were the two chief centres from which\r\nradiated the strongest influences in shaping the development of German\r\norgan art. In the former city Sweelinck became the teacher of most of\r\nthe organists who later laid the foundations of the North German school\r\nof organ-playing, while many of the great South German organists were\r\ntrained in Venice or Rome.\r\n\r\n\r\n                 [Illustration: Early Organ Masters:]\r\n          Top: Girolamo Frescobaldi and Jan Pieters Sweelinck\r\n             Bottom: Samuel Scheidt and  Hans Leo Hassler\r\n\r\n\r\nThe first Germans to develop the art were Conrad Paumann of Nuremberg,\r\nPaulus Hofhaimer of Vienna, and Arnold Schlick of Heidelberg, all\r\nSouth Germans. The circumstances surrounding the life of the first\r\nrepresentative of German organ music, Conrad Paumann, were strangely\r\nsimilar to those of the first great Italian organist, Landino. Both\r\nwere blind (Paumann was born blind), both were of noble family, and\r\nboth mastered nearly every known instrument. Paumann (1410-1473)\r\naroused great enthusiasm by his playing, he travelled much, and his\r\nfame spread to other countries. For many years he was organist at St.\r\nSebald’s Church in Nuremberg, but spent his last years in Munich. He\r\nwas the author of _Fundamentum Organizandi_, the oldest extant work on\r\nthe art of extempore organ-playing; for ‘organizing’ at that period\r\nstill meant adding a counterpoint or organum to a given subject.\r\n\r\nPaulus Hofhaimer (1459-1537), born at Radstadt, was court organist to\r\nEmperor Maximilian I at Vienna. So famous was he that he was knighted\r\nby both the Emperor and the King of Hungary; poets praised him and\r\nLucas Cranach painted his portrait. His contemporary, the organist\r\nLuscinius, described his playing as being ‘full of angelic warmth and\r\npower ... no one has surpassed, no one has even equalled him.’\r\n\r\nOnly the important churches in the larger towns possessed organs in\r\nthe fifteenth century. In the following century, however, interest in\r\norgan-playing and especially in organ-building increased greatly and\r\norganists multiplied rapidly. Among the first of them to gain eminence\r\nwas another famous blind organist, Arnold Schlick, born in Bohemia\r\nabout 1460 and organist to the Elector Palatine at Heidelberg. He was\r\nthe author of the oldest printed German tablature book (1512); in this\r\nindependent pedal parts were used throughout, a great advance over\r\nprevious organ composers.\r\n\r\nIn some of the compositions of Leonhard Kleber (1490-1556) there\r\nappeared the first signs of what later became known as the German\r\nschool of Colorists. This school made its appearance shortly before the\r\nmiddle of the sixteenth century and took its name from the effort of\r\ncomposers to overload their compositions with ornamental rapid passages\r\n(_coloratura_). Many of Kleber’s compositions display all the stability\r\nand earnestness of the Bach period, but the habit of ‘coloring’ the\r\nparts with meaningless ornaments soon took possession of organists\r\nand for a period in the latter part of the century the misuse and\r\nabuse of the art of _coloratura_ caused German organ music to become\r\nutterly mechanical and conventional. The greatest of the colorists were\r\nAmmerbach, organist at St. Thomas’ Church, Leipzig (1560-1571), the\r\nfamous Strasburg organists, Bernard Schmid (father and son), Jacob Paix\r\n(1550-1590), and Johann Woltz.\r\n\r\nAs the seventeenth century dawned, the fashionable art of _coloratura_\r\nwaned and the old solid style of organ-playing inaugurated by Schlick\r\nand continued faithfully by his followers, which had really never\r\nbeen lost by the more obscure musicians, was gradually revived and\r\ngained new strength. A new life-giving element of greatest importance\r\nto organ music was the Lutheran chorale; from it the inane art of the\r\n‘colorists’ received its real death-blow. Its introduction into the\r\nchurch-service and the important place it held there opened up a new\r\nperspective for German organists and offered an artistic opportunity\r\nwhich finally they began to take advantage of. The people loved not\r\nonly to sing the chorales but to hear them played on the organ; the\r\norganists naturally desired to please their listeners, and out of\r\nthe custom of organists to render the chorales about to be sung with\r\nall the resources of their art, gradually arose the _Choralvorspiel_\r\nor prelude. The more abstract contrapuntal treatment or elaboration\r\nof chorale-melodies was abandoned and a new method of treatment\r\nadopted that even up to the present time has failed to exhaust their\r\npossibilities. The great plasticity of these chorale-preludes was\r\nfirst revealed by Pachelbel; the elaboration of them was brought\r\nto the highest perfection of expression and poetry by the immortal\r\ngenius of Sebastian Bach and their present-day possibilities have been\r\ngrandly demonstrated in the _Choral-fantasias_ of Max Reger. In the\r\nchorale-prelude is to be found the basis of the solidity of style that\r\nafter Scheidt’s time has characterized German organ music, and in the\r\ncultivation of this form the German organist has found the most ample\r\nand satisfying opportunity for the exercise of his highest artistic\r\nabilities. The Lutheran service gave far greater opportunities to the\r\norganist than did the Roman service; in this fact is to be found one\r\npowerful reason, among others, why German organ music advanced rapidly\r\nwhile Italian organ music remained at a standstill.\r\n\r\nThe new change in German organ art is strikingly indicated by the\r\n_Tabulatura Nova_, published at Hamburg in 1624 by Samuel Scheidt\r\n(1587-1654) of Halle. The music in this important work is entirely free\r\nfrom the pernicious influence of _coloratura_ and for the first time\r\nchorales are treated as pure organ music. Scheidt, who was a pupil of\r\nthe great Dutch organist and teacher Sweelinck and a contemporary of\r\nFrescobaldi, was one of the three great S’s of the seventeenth century\r\n(the other two being Schütz of Dresden and Schein of Leipzig, all\r\nthree being born about the same time). He was one of the most famous\r\norganists of the century and did much to set the seal of permanence\r\non the forms of organ music that henceforth were chiefly cultivated\r\nby German organ composers. These forms were the figured chorale,\r\nthe prelude and fugue, the canzona, the toccata, and the fantasia.\r\nScheidt’s importance lies in his artistic treatment of the chorale,\r\nan idea that was taken up with such success a hundred years later by\r\nthe great Bach. By the middle of the seventeenth century German organ\r\nmusic had attached itself firmly to the solid ideals it has ever since\r\nmaintained.\r\n\r\nNuremberg, the old home of German art in South Germany, was also one\r\nof the principal nurseries of early German organ art and held its\r\nleading position until the beginning of the eighteenth century. The\r\nfirst of the celebrated Nuremberg organists was Hans Leo Hassler\r\n(1564-1612), one of the real founders of German music. He was organist\r\nto the fabulously wealthy Fuggers in Augsburg in 1585 and after\r\npassing several years in Venice as court-musician to Emperor Rudolph,\r\nhe accepted a position as court-organist at Dresden in 1608, where he\r\ndied. He was the composer of the melody to the chorale _Herzlich tut\r\nmich verlangen_, which was such a favorite with Bach that he used it\r\nin many of his chorale-preludes and also in the ‘St. Matthew Passion.’\r\nHis organ works were only three in number, but Ritter maintains that\r\nhe bore the same important relation to German music that the Gabrielis\r\nbore to Italian.\r\n\r\nErasmus Kindermann (1610-1655) spent most of his life in Nuremberg. In\r\nhis _Harmonia Organica_ (published in 1645), consisting of preludes in\r\nthe twelve tones, he composed several strictly in the modern keys (C\r\nmajor, D major, F major) and treated the pedal with great freedom.\r\n\r\nThe greatest of the Nuremberg organists and one of the most celebrated\r\nof the seventeenth century was Johann Pachelbel (1653-1706). After\r\nholding the position of organist at various places (among them Erfurt\r\nin 1676, where he taught Christopher Bach, Sebastian’s older brother\r\nand first teacher), he returned to his native city in 1695 as organist\r\nat St. Sebald’s. His organ compositions were very important and\r\ninfluential, among them seventy-eight chorale-preludes--many of merit\r\nand long-standing popularity--several chaconnes, brilliant toccatas,\r\nand chorale-fugues. He was the inventor of this last-named form, the\r\nsubject being the first line of a chorale in diminution. This form was\r\nperfected by Sebastian Bach and in the present day has inspired Max\r\nReger to the composition of his great _chorale-fantasias_, for example,\r\n_Wachet auf, ruft uns die Stimme_.\r\n\r\nAugsburg became the chief centre of activity among the South German\r\nCatholic organists as Nuremberg was the most influential centre of\r\nthe Protestant branch. Christian Erbach (1573-1628), organist of the\r\nAugsburg Cathedral, wrote organ pieces in the style of Merulo and\r\nGabrieli, but in his ritual-music was much influenced by the Protestant\r\nchorale-preludes, except that he employed modal harmonies. An important\r\nAugsburg publication was _Ars magna Consoni et Dissoni_ (‘The Great\r\nArt of Consonance and Dissonance’) by Johann Speth, the cathedral\r\norganist, containing the best contemporary toccatas and magnificats,\r\nand some important airs with variations. The first great name of this\r\ngroup is Johann Jacob Froberger (about 1610-1667), who passed much of\r\nhis life in Vienna as court-organist. Ferdinand III sent him to Rome\r\n(1637-1641) to study under Frescobaldi and he became one of the most\r\nfamous German organists and instrumental composers of the century. His\r\norgan works--25 toccatas, 8 fantasias, 6 canzonas, fugues, etc.--are\r\nimportant largely because of their great influence on J. S. Bach’s\r\ndevelopment; his music sounds now more archaic than its date of\r\ncomposition would indicate. Johann Kaspar Kerl (1621-1693), through\r\nthe munificence of Emperor Ferdinand III, likewise was sent to Rome to\r\nstudy under Frescobaldi and Carissimi and exerted a wide influence as\r\norganist and composer at Munich and Vienna. His published organ works\r\nwere largely toccatas and canzonas in the Italian style.\r\n\r\nThe most excellent and at the same time the last of the great German\r\nCatholic organists until the nineteenth century was Georg Muffat\r\n(about 1645-1704). This really great artist deserves a much deeper\r\nappreciation than history has yet accorded him. His great work,\r\n_Apparatus Musico Organisticus_ (1690), consisting of toccatas, a\r\nchaconne, a passacaglia, and other pieces, displays as fine a quality\r\nof artistic feeling as is to be found in the period before Bach.\r\n‘There is a human feeling about the music of Muffat, which removes it\r\nabove mere counterpoint or exhibition of skill, and appeals to the\r\nheart more than any of the earlier compositions.’[101] Ritter, in his\r\n_Geschichte des Orgelspiels_, says of him: ‘In the toccata he surpasses\r\nall previous German masters except Buxtehude. Inexhaustible in the\r\ninvention of new forms and possessing absolute mastery to express them,\r\nhe is the first who leads the hearer from the realm of mere sound into\r\nthat of real soul-inspired music.’\r\n\r\nWhile organ music was thus developing in South Germany, a vigorous\r\nschool was formed in North Germany, which waxed strong largely under\r\ninfluences that radiated from the great Dutch organist, teacher, and\r\ncomposer, Jan Pieter Sweelinck (1560-1621), at Amsterdam. So many of\r\nthe leading organists[102] of the next generation in North Germany were\r\nhis pupils that he earned the title of ‘Organist-maker’ and virtually\r\nbecame the founder of the North German school of organ-playing.\r\nHis organ works are the most important products of his genius as a\r\ncomposer. He was the first to use the pedal as an integral part of the\r\nfugue and was the inventor of the organ-fugue as a form evolved from\r\none subject with the gradual addition of countersubjects leading up to\r\nan elaborate finale--a form which Bach especially perfected.\r\n\r\nHamburg was one of the most important centres of activity in the\r\nprogress of North German organ music. Here Heinrich Scheidemann\r\n(about 1596-1663), who came of a family of organists, was the first\r\nto attain distinction. He was followed as organist of St. Catherine’s\r\nChurch by his more famous pupil Johann Adam Reinken (1623-1722),\r\nwho had also studied with Sweelinck. Few of his organ compositions\r\nhave remained and these have no marks of special excellence, but he\r\ngained a great reputation as a performer. He had a large four-manual\r\norgan at St. Catherine’s and his great ability in performance and\r\nin improvisation on chorales attracted people from distant places.\r\nHe was organist there for sixty years, retaining his full faculties\r\nuntil his death at the remarkable age of ninety-nine. Sebastian Bach\r\ntwice journeyed on foot from Lüneberg to hear him play and was thereby\r\ngreatly impressed and influenced. On a later visit (1720), after Bach\r\nhimself had improvised for a half-hour on one of Reinken’s favorite\r\nchorales, the Nestor of German organists, then ninety-seven years old,\r\nexclaimed enthusiastically to the younger artist, ‘I thought this art\r\nwould die with me, but I perceive that it lives in you.’ The chief\r\ncharacteristics of his organ-playing were unusual dexterity of foot and\r\nfinger and ingenious combinations of stops.\r\n\r\nDietrich Buxtehude (1637-1707), a Dane born at Helsingör, was the\r\ngreatest of the North German group of organists and exerted a still\r\nmore profound and stimulating influence on Bach. He was organist of\r\nthe Marienkirche at Lübeck from 1667 till his death. With one of\r\nthe finest organs in Germany at his disposal (three manuals with\r\nfifty-three stops, of which fifteen were on the pedal), he made Lübeck\r\nfamous for its music. In 1673 he started an innovation in church-music\r\nthat attracted international attention. This was a series of sacred\r\nconcerts, called _Abendmusiken_, in connection with the Sunday\r\nafternoon services during November and December of each year, at which\r\nfamous singers and players assisted. These performances were continued\r\nuntil early in the nineteenth century. In 1705 Sebastian Bach, then a\r\nyouth of twenty years, walked fifty miles from Arnstadt to hear him\r\nin one of these performances and in 1703 Handel visited Lübeck for\r\nthe same purpose. Buxtehude left many works for organ, the greatest\r\nof which are his fugues. Two volumes (edited by Spitta) contain most\r\nvaluable music--in all about seventy works, consisting of passacaglias,\r\nchaconnes, three toccatas, fifteen fugues, and a large number of\r\nchorale-preludes. Many of these disclose the fact that he had brought\r\norgan music to a point of development that needed only the touch of\r\nBach’s overpowering genius for consummation. Among the lesser figures\r\nthat surround the giant Bach, Buxtehude towers highest. He modulated\r\nfreely into all keys as Bach did, his harmonies were often as bold,\r\nand he welded the old threefold North German fugue into a close-knit,\r\norganically developed unity that clearly foreshadowed Bach’s more solid\r\nand compact form.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                   III\r\n\r\nBetween the sturdy schools of North and South Germany there grew the\r\nSaxon or Thuringian, in which the best influences of both schools\r\ninterlocked. Here in central Germany, especially in Thuringia where\r\n‘every peasant knows music’ (as an old proverb runs), there flourished\r\na school that ultimately was the greatest of them all and that gave\r\nto the world Johann Sebastian Bach (1685-1750), not only the greatest\r\nmaster of organ music, but one of the greatest master-minds of all time.\r\n\r\nAn analysis of the special qualities of mind and heart that raised Bach\r\nto such a lofty pinnacle of inspired effort will be found in another\r\nvolume of this series. Our present purpose is concerned only with his\r\norgan works. These are both numerous and epoch-making. They carry to\r\nthe highest point of perfection in workmanship and expression all the\r\ninstrumental forms that had been in the making for a century and a half\r\nbefore his hand of magic touched them with its transforming power; and\r\ntheir naturalness, spontaneity, grandeur, and nobility of content and\r\nform have been at once the despair and inspiration of nearly every\r\ngreat musician since his time. The organ was the central point in\r\nBach’s art, as the orchestra was in Beethoven’s; it was his natural\r\nvoice, his most sympathetic medium of expression. No matter what form\r\nhe chose to write in, the organist’s mode of thought and expression\r\nis apparent--as much in his choral works as in those for clavier.\r\nRobert Schumann says: ‘Most wonderful and bold in his primal element\r\nis Bach at his organ. Here he knows no bounds and works for centuries\r\nahead. The majority of his fugues are characteristic pieces of the\r\nhighest order, often truly poetic creations, each one demanding its own\r\ncharacteristic expression and its own color and light.’ Goethe ventures\r\nthe bold assertion that ‘in listening to Bach’s music it seems as if\r\ndivine harmony were intercoursing with itself, as might have happened\r\nin the bosom of God before the creation of the world.’\r\n\r\nBoth of his parents died when Sebastian was ten years old and the boy\r\nwas brought up and educated by his elder brother Johann Christian,\r\na pupil of Pachelbel and organist and school-master at Ohrdruf. His\r\norgan training was of the most meagre description, but he was an\r\nindefatigable worker and thinker. His first organ position was at\r\nArnstadt in 1704, in 1707 he removed to Mühlhausen, from 1708 to 1717\r\nhe was court-organist at Weimar, from 1717 to 1723 court chapel-master\r\nat Cöthen, and from 1723 till his death cantor of the Thomas School at\r\nLeipzig. His organ works number about 150, of which only a small number\r\nwere published during his lifetime. Of the total number about ninety\r\nare chorale-preludes (great and small). The remaining works comprise\r\nnineteen large preludes and fugues, eight little preludes and fugues,\r\nfive toccatas and fugues, two fantastias and fugues, seven independent\r\nfugues, four fantasias, a passacaglia, six sonatas, four concertos, and\r\nseveral shorter pieces.\r\n\r\nIn his early productions Bach leaned strongly toward his predecessors\r\nin art--Pachelbel, Buxtehude, Frescobaldi, Couperin--a period of\r\nearly dependence that is to be observed in the lives of all the great\r\nmasters. He learned alike from German, Italian, and French masters,\r\nassimilated their best influences, and acquired all their resources,\r\nthus enlarging his own field of vision before disclosing his own\r\nindividuality. Incredibly versatile as he is and unapproachable in many\r\nfields, the forms that he endowed with unusual sublimity and grandeur\r\nare the chorale-prelude, the toccata, and the fugue. Of these the\r\nfugue reveals the most characteristic elements of his greatness. The\r\nmanner in which he treated the form of the fugue is unique, without\r\nprecedent or parallel in the history of musical art. This form, as Bach\r\nfound it, was mainly characterized by stiffness, monotony, and lack of\r\nexpression. Under his hands, the greatest contrapuntist of the world,\r\nit acquired elasticity and flexibility; he made the seemingly dry and\r\nhard form so serve his imagination that he was able to produce real\r\ncharacteristic pieces, even musical poems, which reflect his innermost\r\nfeeling in all its different nuances.\r\n\r\nThe Toccata in F shows Bach’s genius in its most resplendent light.\r\nThis piece, with its imposing and truly modern pedal solos, its\r\nintricate contrapuntal structure, its titanic energy, and its startling\r\nmodulations, excited the boundless admiration of Mendelssohn: ‘It\r\nsounded as if the walls of the church might tumble down; what a giant\r\nthat Cantor was!’[103] Three of the other toccatas are powerful\r\ncompositions--the one in C major in the form of an Italian concerto,\r\nand the two in D minor, one of which is sometimes called the ‘Dorian’\r\nbecause there is no B-flat in the signature and the other, majestic and\r\nbrilliant.\r\n\r\nOf the rich treasure of preludes and fugues that he left, the great\r\nLeipzig pieces, written in the full maturity of his power, deserve\r\nspecial mention. They are the ones in C minor, G minor, A minor, E\r\nminor, and B minor--all ‘stupendous creations,’ as Spitta designates\r\nthem. The E minor Prelude and Fugue is called a ‘symphony’ by Spitta.\r\nThe Fugue, with its ‘wedge’ theme, is the longest of Bach’s fugues--231\r\nmeasures--but the interest never flags for a moment. That Bach not\r\nonly ‘violated’ rules but made his own, is shown by the fact that he\r\nintroduces into his fugue a _da capo_--from measure 172 repeating\r\nthe beginning part. The lofty B minor Prelude and Fugue is replete\r\nwith glowing beauties. Of the highest type of perfection and full\r\nof expressive eloquence is the E-flat major Prelude and Fugue. The\r\nFugue, which is sometimes called ‘the St. Anne Fugue’ from the chance\r\nresemblance of its subject to the first line of an English hymn-tune of\r\nthat name, is built on the model of the old Italian threefold fugue,\r\nin the last sections of which the subjects are combined and interwoven\r\nwith consummate skill.\r\n\r\nThe Fantasia in G minor is one of the most majestic works in the entire\r\nliterature of music. The Fugue associated with it is not as great as\r\nthe Fantasia, but is an exceedingly effective concert piece and a\r\nmasterful composition. It is a favorite not only with organists but\r\nwith all musicians, and has been transcribed for pianoforte by Liszt\r\nand for orchestra by Abert. Its popularity with the general public is\r\ndue not a little to the unusually pleasing character of the subject\r\nitself, which possesses all the jollity and grace of a dance-theme.\r\nBach’s fugue-subjects (and fugue-subjects in general) are seldom\r\ninteresting or pleasing as individual melodies. Their value is almost\r\nwholly architectonic. The master architect will rear a structure of\r\nsignificant beauty and imposing grandeur out of a mass of individually\r\nuninteresting and meaningless brick and stone. In much the same way,\r\nthe composer views his fugue-subject mainly as a constructional item.\r\nHis interest is centred on the structure itself and the process of\r\nconstruction. Notwithstanding this objective, impersonal point of view,\r\nit is undeniably true that those fugues that have made the deepest\r\npopular impression are constructed on subjects that are in themselves\r\nmelodically interesting, such as this G minor Fugue, the C minor\r\nFugue from the ‘Well-tempered Clavichord,’ and the C minor Fugue from\r\nMendelssohn’s Three Preludes and Fugues for organ.\r\n\r\nIn a class by itself is the wonderful Passacaglia in C minor, which\r\nBach wrote as an advanced exercise (a practice piece!) for the\r\ntwo-manual and pedal clavichord. It consists of twenty variations on a\r\n_basso ostinato_ of eight measures. The theme is announced by the pedal\r\nalone _pianissimo_ and is repeated over and over again in one voice or\r\nanother while the other parts build up a structure of ever-increasing\r\nelaborateness and magnificence, the whole concluding with a fugue whose\r\nsubject is derived from the _basso ostinato_.\r\n\r\nThe eight ‘Little Preludes and Fugues,’ so familiar to organ students\r\nthe world over, were composed probably for his own numerous pupils.\r\n\r\nThe six sonatas (or trios) of Bach were not written for the organ but\r\nfor the pedal-clavier for the use of his son Friedemann. However,\r\nthe wonderful three-part writing makes them especially suitable for\r\nreproduction on the organ and affords excellent opportunity for color\r\nand contrast in registration. They contain a wealth of musical ideas of\r\nvarying moods, character, and deep expression, full of soul and life,\r\nand clothed in attractive and often playful technique, the highest\r\nof Bach’s art--a constant source of inspiration to the organist that\r\nwill take the time to delve into their depths. They are not sonatas,\r\nof course, in the modern sense of the word. Of special value may be\r\nmentioned the following numbers from them: the first Allegro of Sonata\r\nNo. 1 in E-flat, the elaboration of which approaches the modern sonata;\r\nthe Largo and Finale (in reality a masterful fugue) of the Second\r\nSonata in C minor; the whole of the Third Sonata in D minor, the Adagio\r\nbeing of especial beauty; the Andante and Allegro (Finale) of the\r\nFourth Sonata in E minor, in the Andante the harmonic effects being so\r\nfull and complete that one forgets that only three voices furnish the\r\nmaterial; the Largo of Sonata No. 5 with its rich figuration work; and\r\nthe first Allegro and the Largo of the Sixth Sonata in G major.\r\n\r\nThe real soul of Bach’s organ art is to be found in that numerous\r\ngroup of his organ works that take the chorale for basis and\r\ninspiration. Many of these are short compositions intended for use in\r\nthe church service, but many are long and elaborate and written for\r\nconcert use. They appear in three forms, the chorale-prelude (figured\r\nand fugal), the chorale-fantasia, and the chorale-variation. The\r\nsignification of the chorale in the services of the Church to which\r\nBach had dedicated the full strength of his artistic powers sank deep\r\ninto his soul and the heart-beat of religious sentiment and devotion\r\nconstantly furnished stimulus and direction to his imagination and\r\nintellect. His chorales frequently speak to us in a language suggestive\r\nof words, but which words cannot express, the secret remaining in\r\nthe music. Inexhaustible are the forms that thus find characteristic\r\nexpression, born of the poetical suggestion. In the chorale ‘Through\r\nAdam’s fall we all are doomed’ the fall into sin is suggested by the\r\never-recurrence of the interval of a seventh in the bass. In _Christ,\r\nunser Herr, zum Jordan kam_ the rushing waters of the river Jordan\r\nare portrayed by the swift notes of the bass in the left hand with\r\n16-foot tone, while the subject is played by the pedal with 8-foot\r\ntone. In the variations on the chorale _Vom Himmel hoch da komm’ ich\r\nher_ in canon-form, Bach astonishes with his almost superhuman mastery\r\nof contrapuntal devices, but the expressive power never suffers, the\r\nmathematical element and the musical fantasy joining in harmonious and\r\npoetical union.\r\n\r\nSo many of Bach’s works have been transcribed for other\r\ninstruments[104] that the following comment by Busoni[105] will have\r\ninterest: ‘One finds among the master’s organ works pieces of a more\r\npianistic character, as one finds among the piano fugues some that show\r\nthe type of organ pieces. The technical manner of Bach’s writing is in\r\nits essence the same for both instruments. The transcription of his\r\nworks from the organ to the piano (or _vice versa_) cannot, therefore,\r\nbe regarded as wrong, esthetically considered.’\r\n\r\n\r\n                                   IV\r\n\r\nThe early organ masters in France were neither as numerous nor as\r\nimportant as in either Italy or Germany, and no significant advance\r\ncame from France in this field. The organ was late in getting a\r\nfoothold in this country, there being no record of any church-organ\r\nthere before the twelfth century; no school of French composers for\r\nthe instrument appeared until the sixteenth century. In 1530 and 1531,\r\nhowever, a five-volume collection of organ pieces was published in\r\nParis by the printer Pierre Attaignant, though no composers’ names are\r\ngiven. This book gives a trustworthy indication of the French art of\r\norgan-playing at that time. The collection consists of (1) original\r\norgan music--preludes, (2) vocal music arranged for the organ--motets,\r\nTe Deums, Kyries, and Magnificats in the eight modes, and (3) secular\r\nsongs and dance music intended for the house-organ or clavier. In\r\nFrance, as elsewhere, no distinction was made in writing for clavier\r\nand organ, though the latter enjoyed the preference, as it was also a\r\nhouse instrument. The early French masters had a true understanding\r\nof the nature of the organ. Their playing was neither frivolous nor\r\nover-serious, but natural and free. A tendency to emphasize effective\r\nand ingenious registration rather than the worth of the composition\r\nmanifested itself among French organists as early as the sixteenth\r\ncentury and this has been a prominent characteristic of French\r\norgan-music ever since. French organists of the sixteenth century,\r\nhowever, seem to have possessed greater facility on the pedals than\r\ntheir German contemporaries.\r\n\r\nIn 1626 Jean Titelouze (1563-1633), a priest of St. Omer, and canon\r\nand organist of the Cathedral of Rouen, published at Paris ‘Magnificats\r\nin all the Tones, with Versets, for Organ.’ His organ compositions\r\nare of considerable merit and he may be regarded as the founder of\r\nFrench organ-playing. The school of Titelouze produced two excellent\r\norganists--Nicolas Gigault[106] (born 1645), who, as Fétis says, was\r\n‘one of the good French organists of the seventeenth-century school,\r\nwhich was superior to that of the eighteenth century’; and André Raison\r\n(born about 1650), organist of the abbey of St. Geneviève in Paris,\r\npublished in 1688 his _Livre d’Orgue_ containing masses, an offertoire,\r\nand a piece imitating Froberger’s descriptive music entitled _Vive le\r\nRoy_, written for the festival which commemorated the recovery of Louis\r\nXIV from illness. It was stated that the purpose of the book was ‘to\r\nshow organists, both male and female, who are shut up in provincial\r\ncloisters, how to make use of the excellent novelties and the increase\r\nin the number of keyboards introduced by modern organ-builders.’\r\nRaison’s music shows, in the indicated stops to be used, that the\r\nFrench preference for reed stops had already manifested itself.\r\n\r\nJacques Champion de Chambonnières (the last part of which name he\r\nassumed when he married the heiress of an estate of that name)\r\nwas first chamber clavecinist to Louis XIII. His influence on the\r\ndevelopment of organ music was almost entirely through his famous\r\npupils, of whom, like Sweelinck, he had many, among them Le Bègue,\r\nd’Anglebert, and the elder Couperins. He died in 1670, but left no\r\ncontributions to the literature of the organ.\r\n\r\nNicolas Antoine le Bègue (1630-1702), organist to the king, in 1676\r\npublished three books of _Pièces d’Orgue_. He was a very skillful\r\norganist and a thorough contrapuntist. His book contains offertories,\r\nsymphonies (the same in form that Handel later employed for his\r\novertures), Noëls, elevations, mass music, magnificats, preludes, solos\r\nfor various stops, trios for two manuals and pedal, and dialogues for\r\ntwo manuals.\r\n\r\nJean Henri d’Anglebert, chamber clavecinist to Louis XIV, published in\r\n1689 _Pièces de Claveçin_, with a supplement of some organ music. This\r\ncontains among other things a quartet for three manuals and pedal, two\r\nof the parts to be played with one hand on two keyboards, which would\r\nhave been impossible on any organ of this period outside of France on\r\naccount of the distance between the keyboards. By the beginning of\r\nthe eighteenth century France possessed many large organs with three,\r\nfour, and sometimes even five manuals. The largest instruments had an\r\nEcho organ, and the _Voix Humaine_ and Tremulant were as popular then\r\nas now. The pedal-board had a much larger compass than on present-day\r\norgans, extending from F below the present lowest C to thirty-six\r\nnotes; but the pedal had no 16-foot stops, only 8-and 4-foot, the pedal\r\nbeing used, not for bass as now, but for carrying the tenor or subject.\r\nIt was later reduced to thirty notes, beginning with the lowest C as at\r\npresent.\r\n\r\nThe Couperin family played much the same important part in the\r\ndevelopment of French music as the Bach family did in Germany and both\r\nin the same field, that of instrumental music. For several generations\r\nthe Couperins were distinguished musicians; the post of organist of\r\nSt. Gervais remained in the family as a kind of ‘living’ from about\r\n1650 until 1815. The most important and renowned member of this\r\nfamily was François (1668-1733), called _Couperin le Grand_ because\r\nof his acknowledged superiority in organ and claveçin-playing. He was\r\norganist at St. Gervais in 1698, but was soon promoted to the position\r\nof clavecinist and organist to the king. Notwithstanding his great\r\nreputation as a performer on the organ, he wrote nothing especially\r\nfor that instrument. His paramount interest as a composer lay in the\r\ndevelopment of the claveçin or harpsichord and his work indicates\r\nthe point of historical development where the organ and the keyboard\r\ninstruments of the claveçin or harpsichord type parted, each to travel\r\nits own path independent of the other. His part in the creation of the\r\nmodern pianoforte school is discussed in another volume.\r\n\r\nLouis Nicolas Clérambault (1676-1749), a pupil of André Raison and his\r\nsuccessor at St. Jacques, later at St. Sulpice, composed much organ\r\nmusic, some of which has been newly edited by Guilmant in his _Archives\r\ndes Maîtres de l’Orgue_.\r\n\r\nLouis Marchand (1669-1732) belonged to a family that was celebrated\r\nin the annals of French music, mostly in the field of stringed\r\ninstruments. He published a volume of organ music, some of which has\r\nbeen edited by Guilmant in the work just mentioned. He had a great\r\nreputation as a player, but his compositions betray the trivial and\r\nsuperficial musician. He was appointed court organist at Versailles and\r\nfor a time was very much the fashion as a teacher. But as a man he was\r\neccentric in manner and dissipated in habits--so much so that the king\r\nis said to have insisted on paying half of his salary to his wife. This\r\nincensed the musician, and one day he stopped playing in the middle of\r\na mass and walked out of the church. When the king indignantly called\r\nhim to account for his unusual behavior, he replied: ‘Sire, if my wife\r\ngets half my salary, she may play half the service.’ In punishment he\r\nwas banished for a time and went to Germany. While in Dresden in 1717\r\nhe met Sebastian Bach and a contest between the two on the organ was\r\narranged, but to avoid inevitable defeat at the hands (and feet) of the\r\ngreat German he suddenly left Dresden and returned to Paris, and the\r\ncontest never took place.\r\n\r\nFar more important than Marchand as a musician was Jean Philippe\r\nRameau (1683-1764). While his chief fame rests on his operas,\r\ntheoretical works, and claveçin music, he won a great reputation as an\r\norganist (in Clermont, Lille, and Paris), especially as an extempore\r\nplayer, and was considered the greatest French organist of his time. He\r\npublished no music written especially for organ, however.\r\n\r\nDom Jean François Bedos de Celles (about 1714-1797), a Benedictine\r\nmonk, deserves mention here, not as an organist, but as a builder. His\r\nbook _L’Art du Facteur d’Orgues_ contains much valuable information\r\nabout the condition of French organs in the eighteenth century and\r\nindicates that a great advance in organ-building was taking place.\r\nThe author gives much advice for effective combinations of registers\r\nsuitable for certain kinds of pieces; he finally says: ‘The more an\r\norganist understands how to exhibit the resources of his organ, the\r\nmore will he please the public and himself.’\r\n\r\nFrench keyboard music of the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries\r\nshowed a marked preference for instruments of the harpsichord and\r\nclavichord type. During the eighteenth century French composers for,\r\nand performers on, these instruments were supreme in Europe, but\r\norgan-music west of the Rhine has been, on the whole, quite unimportant\r\nfrom early times until nearly the middle of the nineteenth century.\r\n\r\nOrgan-music in Spain and Portugal followed Italian and French models\r\nand until about 1700 maintained a place of equal importance and worth\r\nwith that of Italy. It is worthy of mention that the first musician\r\nto raise the standard of revolt against the mediæval system of tuning\r\nand to advocate a system of ‘temperament’ was a Spaniard, Ramis de\r\nPareja, born in Andalusia about 1440. There are a few prominent names\r\namong Spanish organists, such as Félix Antonio Cabezón (1510-1566),\r\nThomas de Santa Maria (died 1570), and Pablo Nassare (born 1664), but\r\nno noteworthy progress was made here, organ music exhibiting the same\r\nstate of lethargy that was apparent in all Catholic countries during\r\nthe period from Frescobaldi until the middle of the nineteenth century.\r\n\r\nWith the Reformation the Netherlands divided along the line of\r\nreligious sympathies. Belgium remained true to the Roman Church and\r\nher organ-music developed, as in France, according to the needs of the\r\nRoman ritual. Holland, however, embraced Lutheranism and Calvinism,\r\nand, as soon as Spanish rule was overthrown in 1581, took a prominent\r\nlead, through her great organists, Sweelinck (whose work has been\r\nalready noted) and Anthony van Noordt (middle of seventeenth century),\r\nin developing an organ style responsive to the needs of the Protestant\r\nritual.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                   V\r\n\r\nIn England peculiar conditions have prevailed from very early times\r\nin respect to organ-music. Early English musicians were easily the\r\npeers of those of any continental country. Some of the oldest and most\r\nfamous organs were built in England and the house organ was cultivated\r\nthere with as much zeal and artistic energy as in any other country.\r\nBut, even after the Reformation, the choir has always dominated English\r\nchurch-music and until very recent years the organ has been regarded as\r\nwholly secondary in importance. All great English church-music up to\r\nthe present generation has been vocal. We find in the Anglican service\r\nno counterpart of the chorale-prelude in the Lutheran service or the\r\ncanzona and toccata in the Roman. The organ in the Anglican service\r\nhas been employed consistently and primarily as accompaniment for the\r\nhighly-trained choirs and its independent use has been confined almost\r\nexclusively to playing before and after the services.\r\n\r\nHandicapped as it was by lack of appreciation within the Church,\r\norgan-music was further retarded in its development by the curious\r\nreluctance of English builders to adopt pedals and to give up the old\r\nsystem of tuning. Until well into the nineteenth century very few\r\nEnglish organs possessed pedals and in these few the pedal-board rarely\r\nexceeded an octave and a half in compass. In the matter of tuning, the\r\nsystem of ‘equal temperament’ was not adopted for English organs until\r\nmore than a century after it had been firmly established in practical\r\nuse on the continent. Here again the domination of the voices in the\r\nservice is apparent. Whether this mechanical inferiority of the organ\r\nwas related to its secondary position in English church-music as cause\r\nor effect, is not germane to our purpose to discuss.\r\n\r\nSo unimportant was the organ considered in early English church-music\r\nthat no cathedrals maintained organists until the time of the\r\nReformation, the singers taking turns at playing the instrument. Henry\r\nAbington, a priest who died in 1497, is the first Englishman mentioned\r\nas having possessed proficiency as an organist (at Wells in 1447 and\r\nMaster of the Chapel Royal after 1465), and his fame in this respect\r\nrests wholly on his epitaph at Stonyhurst: ‘He was the best singer\r\namongst thousands, and besides this, he was the best organist.’\r\n\r\nBut organ music flourished in the palaces of kings and wealthy\r\nnoblemen, where organists and organ-makers were installed as regular\r\nmembers of the households. The greatest epoch of English music was\r\nalso the most brilliant of English organ-playing. Prepared during the\r\nreigns of Henry VIII and Queen Mary, it reached its culminating point\r\nin Queen Elizabeth’s long reign (1558-1603). No examples of organ-music\r\nprior to Elizabeth’s time have been preserved. The organ compositions\r\nof the great Elizabethan organists were written for the house organ\r\nrather than the church organ and are, therefore, scattered through the\r\nnumerous collections of music for the virginal,[107] for they were\r\nplayable on either instrument. Collections of music written for the\r\nchurch organ, so common on the Continent, were unknown in England until\r\nrecent times.\r\n\r\nWhen England espoused the cause of Protestantism, many of her Catholic\r\nmusicians escaped to the Continent, but many remained and were\r\nprotected by the Court from being molested as long as they kept their\r\nprivate religious views to themselves. Among the latter were some of\r\nthe most famous organists and musicians of Elizabeth’s reign--Tye,\r\nTallis, Blitheman, Byrd, and Bull.\r\n\r\nDr. Christopher Tye (about 1515-1572) was organist at Ely from 1541,\r\nand later became organist of the Chapel Royal. He was highly respected\r\nfor his great musical ability and brilliant education, and his style\r\nof writing was scholarly, though singularly unaffected. According to\r\nAnthony Wood he was ‘a peevish and humorsome man, especially in his\r\nlater days,’ and it is related that while he was playing one day in the\r\nchapel of Queen Elizabeth, with whom he was a great favorite, ‘she sent\r\nthe verger to tell him that he played out of tune; whereupon he sent\r\nword that her ears were out of tune.’ With him the most brilliant epoch\r\nof English music begins.\r\n\r\nThomas Redford (died before 1559) was organist and choir-master at St.\r\nPaul’s, London, about 1535. He had the reputation of being one of the\r\nablest instrumental writers of his time and left many organ-pieces.\r\n\r\nThomas Tallis (about 1510-1585) received his first appointment as\r\norganist at Waltham Abbey. At the Dissolution he became one of the\r\norganists of the Chapel Royal, which position he held until 1577\r\nthrough the shifting religious changes of the troublous reigns of\r\nHenry, Edward, Mary, and Elizabeth. He faithfully served the church of\r\nhis adoption by writing some of its finest early anthems, canticles,\r\nand hymn-tunes. Though a famous organist, but few of his organ works\r\nhave remained.\r\n\r\nWilliam Byrd (1543-1623), one of the foremost composers of his period\r\nand distinguished in all the forms then current, was a pupil of, and\r\nworthy successor to, Thomas Tallis, whom he surpassed in everything\r\n‘except in happy speculations.’ He served as organist of Lincoln\r\nCathedral from 1563 and became Gentleman of the Chapel Royal in 1569,\r\ndividing with Tallis the duties of organist. The excellence of his art\r\nis attested by his numerous church compositions and the instrumental\r\npieces, many of which are for organ, contained in the ‘Fitzwilliam\r\nVirginal Book,’ the ‘Virginal Book of Queen Elizabeth,’ and ‘Lady\r\nNevill’s Virginal Book.’\r\n\r\nDr. John Bull (1563-1628) was the most famous virtuoso on the organ and\r\nvirginal of the latter part of the Elizabethan era. He was organist at\r\nHereford in 1582 and in 1591 followed his master Blitheman as organist\r\nof the Chapel Royal. On Queen Elizabeth’s recommendation he was\r\nappointed professor of music at Gresham College in 1596, which position\r\nhe held for eleven years. In 1613 he was compelled to ‘go beyond the\r\nseas without license,’ as was the euphonious phrase for running away.\r\nHe became the Archduke’s organist at Brussels and four years later went\r\nto Antwerp where he was cathedral organist until his death. He was a\r\ncurious personality, but a most excellent artist, exhibiting marvellous\r\ncontrapuntal skill and originality. In his preludes and fantasias,\r\nnotably in a Fantasia on the hexachord, his modulations and complicated\r\nrhythms display a strong modern feeling.\r\n\r\nOne of the greatest names in the history of English church-music is\r\nthat of Orlando Gibbons (1583-1625), the last of the early school of\r\nEnglish church composers. In 1623 he became organist at Westminster\r\nAbbey and was one of the most renowned organists of his time, but\r\npublished only a few pieces for keyed instruments--some dances and a\r\nfantasia. All the great English composers of this period were also\r\ngreat organists, for the chief musicians at the cathedral and Chapel\r\nRoyal were all organists. All excelled as extempore performers,\r\nand, when solo work was required, they exercised their skill in\r\nimprovisation and felt small necessity for writing what they played.\r\n\r\nAt the beginning of the seventeenth century the musical art of the\r\nEnglish Church received a staggering blow from the fanatical ideas and\r\niconoclastic acts of the Puritans. Their misdirected zeal was aimed at\r\nall art; choirs were abolished, paintings and organs were destroyed,\r\nand priceless treasures were wantonly burned. After the restoration of\r\nthe monarchy in 1660 more liberal views prevailed and there quickly\r\nfollowed a revival of musical activity. But only a few musicians\r\nsurvived the years of artistic darkness under Puritan domination--they\r\nhad either emigrated or chosen other professions. The destroyed organs\r\nwere rebuilt with utmost haste and foreign organ-builders were summoned\r\nto give aid. Among these were two Germans by the name of Schmidt, one\r\nof whom became famous as Father Smith. These organs were still in a\r\nprimitive form, the pedal not being considered necessary and, indeed,\r\nnot being added until Handel in his concertos insisted on their use.\r\nWith the new era came also an influx of new ideas from the Continent.\r\nPelham Humfrey infused a more modern style into the music of the\r\ncathedral service and the organ for a time was permitted to assume\r\nthe importance of a solo instrument.[108] Furthermore, the organ soon\r\nbecame a feature of theatre and concert performances and the area of\r\nits influence was thus widened.\r\n\r\nJohn Blow (1648-1708) was one of the first of the noted musicians of\r\nthe ‘new school.’ He was chosen organist of Westminster Abbey at the\r\nage of twenty-one. Eleven years later his pupil, Purcell, was appointed\r\nto this office at Blow’s request, but at Purcell’s death Blow was\r\nreinstated. He also held the post of organist and composer to the king.\r\nHe was a voluminous composer, writing a vast amount of church-music\r\nand also a considerable number of voluntaries for the organ, of which\r\nrelatively little has been published. His style is strong, healthy,\r\nand, in harmonic progression, frequently in advance of his time. One\r\nof his organ pieces is a ‘Voluntary for ye Cornet stop,’ beginning\r\nwith a short fugal passage which introduces the solo. It is dignified\r\nand effective, but the popularity of such solo effects led in the next\r\ncentury to a style that brought about a debasement of organ-music that\r\nwas far-reaching in its effects.\r\n\r\nWilliam Croft (1677-1727), though a distinguished composer and\r\norganist, did not exert as wide an influence on organ-music as some of\r\nhis contemporaries. He was a pupil of Blow and after his master’s death\r\nsucceeded him as organist of Westminster Abbey. He wrote twelve organ\r\nvoluntaries, but they are not published.\r\n\r\nMaurice Greene (1696-1755) was organist at St. Paul’s, London, in\r\n1718, and succeeded Croft as organist and composer to the Chapel Royal\r\nin 1727. In 1730 he was appointed professor of music at Cambridge\r\nUniversity. He was a prolific and able composer and rendered most\r\nvaluable service to English cathedral music. He also published several\r\norgan voluntaries, in which he departed from the serious and fugal\r\nstyle of his choral music and employed such ear-tickling solo stops as\r\nthe Cornet and Vox Humana to an excess that brought into existence a\r\nhost of tawdry and vulgar imitations.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                   VI\r\n\r\nThere remain to be mentioned the two most distinguished names in\r\nEnglish music--Purcell and Handel--the one, who undoubtedly would\r\nhave founded a school of real English music had not his life been cut\r\noff at so untimely an age, the other, who, though a German, actually\r\ndid found a great English school a half-century later on the lines so\r\nbrilliantly suggested by his English predecessor. The year 1658 may\r\nbe said to mark the beginning of a new era in English music; in it\r\noccurred the death of Cromwell, who, with all his greatness, stood for\r\nPuritan ideas of artistic repression, and the birth of Henry Purcell\r\n(1658-1695), who raised the musical fame of England to a height it had\r\nnever before attained. Though he died at the age of only thirty-seven,\r\nlike Mozart and Schubert he wrote with amazing swiftness and produced\r\nan astonishing quantity of music in every form, far in advance of his\r\nEnglish, and most of his continental, contemporaries in quality and\r\nworkmanship. His music that falls within the scope of the present\r\ninquiry consists of some four-part sonatas and suites for organ or\r\nharpsichord. One of the most excellent of these is a Toccata in A,\r\nwhich possesses such unusual musical qualities for that period that it\r\nwas for a long time considered to be one of Sebastian Bach’s earlier\r\nworks. The modern feeling for key seems to be fully established in\r\nPurcell’s music. In this respect and in the fluency and expressional\r\npower of his counterpoint he anticipated Bach by fully three decades.\r\nPurcell was organist of Westminster Abbey in 1680 and of the Chapel\r\nRoyal in 1682.\r\n\r\nGeorge Frederick Handel (1685-1759) was the greatest representative\r\nof English music in the eighteenth century and one of the most\r\nbrilliant organists of his time; his influence in both choral and organ\r\nfields was supreme in England until the advent of Mendelssohn. Handel’s\r\norgan-playing brought him fame earlier than did his operas. In 1703 he\r\nvisited Lübeck with his friend Mattheson and listened with deep respect\r\nto Buxtehude at the _Marienkirche_. One purpose of the visit was to\r\nlook into the possibilities of succeeding the venerable organist, but\r\none condition of the succession was that the person who accepted the\r\nappointment should also marry the daughter of the retiring organist.\r\nAfter looking over the situation both Handel and Mattheson declined the\r\nhonor. During his Italian visit (1706-1709) he met Domenico Scarlatti,\r\nwho was only two years his senior, and together they journeyed from\r\nFlorence to Rome, forming a friendship that lasted throughout their\r\nlong careers. In Rome Cardinal Ottoboni arranged a sort of competition\r\nbetween them. The contest was undecided on the harpsichord, but when\r\nHandel had played on the organ, Scarlatti was the first to acknowledge\r\nhis friend’s superiority, saying that he had not believed such playing\r\nas Handel’s was possible. His London experience began in 1711, when he\r\ncreated a great sensation by the production of his opera _Rinaldo_,\r\nwritten in fourteen days by piecing together arias and choruses of\r\nearlier composition. The _Utrecht Te Deum_ in 1713 further increased\r\nhis fame in England and in 1719 he was appointed director of the Royal\r\nAcademy of Music, which became the scene of his operatic triumphs and\r\ntrials. Later in life he turned his attention wholly to the composition\r\nof religious works and produced in quick succession the sublime\r\noratorios that brought him immortality. It was in connection with these\r\noratorios that his organ concertos came into existence. Handel had a\r\ngreat reputation as an organist, especially as an extempore player.\r\nThis reputation he was wise enough to capitalize and, as a means of\r\nattracting larger audiences to hear his oratorios, he exhibited his\r\nskill as performer between the acts, to the great delight of his\r\nlisteners. He was not always in a mood for extemporizing, however, and\r\nhis thirty-three concertos for organ (most of them with orchestra) were\r\nwritten for such occasions, many being merely transcriptions of his\r\nconcertos for various other instruments. They are cast in the form of\r\neither the Italian concerto or the French overture. Since they were not\r\nwritten for use in church, but in the theatre, they are for the most\r\npart in light and flowing vein, brilliant in character but free from\r\ntriviality, and serve as excellent display pieces. They contain fine\r\nmusic and must be regarded as good works of art. The most important\r\nare No. 1 in G minor, No. 4 in F major, and No. 10 in D minor. These\r\nworks became so popular that Burney says,[109] ‘public players on keyed\r\ninstruments totally subsisted on these concertos for nearly thirty\r\nyears.’\r\n\r\nSir John Hawkins[110] gives a glowing account of Handel’s\r\norgan-playing. ‘As to his performance on the organ,’ he says, ‘the\r\npowers of speech are so limited that it is almost a vain attempt to\r\ndescribe it otherwise than by its effects. A firm and delicate touch,\r\na volant finger, and a ready delivery of passages the most difficult,\r\nare the praise of inferior artists; they were not noticed in Handel,\r\nwhose excellences were of a far superior kind, and his amazing command\r\nof the instrument, the fullness of his harmony, the grandeur and\r\ndignity of his style, the fertility of his invention, were qualities\r\nthat absorbed every inferior attainment. When he gave a concerto, his\r\nmethod in general was to introduce it with a voluntary movement on the\r\nDiapasons, which stole on the ear in a slow and solemn progression; the\r\nharmony close-wrought and as full as could possibly be expressed; the\r\npassages concatenated with stupendous art, the whole at the time being\r\nperfectly intelligible and carrying the appearance of great simplicity.\r\nThis kind of prelude was succeeded by the concerto itself, which he\r\nexecuted with a degree of spirit and firmness that no one could pretend\r\nto equal. Such, in general, was the manner of his performance; but who\r\nshall describe its effects upon the enraptured auditory? Silence, the\r\ntruest applause, succeeded the instant that he addressed himself to the\r\ninstrument, and that so profound that it checked respiration and seemed\r\nto control the functions of nature, while the magic of his touch kept\r\nthe attention of his hearers awake only to those enchanting sounds to\r\nwhich it gave utterance.’\r\n\r\n\r\n                              FOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[96] Quoted in _Sammelbände der Intern.

Johann\r\nJoachim Quantz, in his book, _Versuch einer Anweisung die Flöte zu\r\nspielen_ (1752), expresses the fear that after his (Bach’s) death the\r\nart of organ-playing, which he had brought to the highest perfection,\r\nmight deteriorate or possibly disappear, ‘as there are only a few\r\nthat cultivate it.’ He complains that ‘good organists are very rare,’\r\nbut intimates that one reason is that they receive very little\r\nencouragement, since the majority of them are paid ‘such miserably\r\nsmall salaries.’ But while Bach’s creative genius had said the last\r\nword in organ music in the particular forms which he employed, he\r\nhanded down his wonderful art of playing to a galaxy of brilliant\r\npupils and especially to his oldest son, Wilhelm Friedemann.\r\n\r\nFor a century after Bach’s death, however, the attention of musical\r\nEurope was absorbed in following other lines of development and his\r\ninfluence was not immediately apparent. He was so far in advance of\r\nhis age that the essence of his art had to wait several generations\r\ntill the world had progressed enough to perceive it and in a few years\r\nafter he had passed he became only a tradition. The organ was soon\r\novershadowed in importance by new media of musical expression; the\r\norchestra and the rapidly developing pianoforte, the opera and the\r\noratorio, the symphony and the sonata, offered novel and more alluring\r\nopportunities for the imagination and creative fancy of composers\r\nthan did the sombre, polyphonic forms that seemed best suited both to\r\nthe church services themselves and to the organ of the period as an\r\ninterpreting instrument. And neither the organ nor organ-music was\r\nrescued from the secondary and unimportant position into which both\r\nfell after Bach’s time, until organ-builders in the last half of the\r\nnineteenth century began to introduce mechanical improvements which\r\nmade the instrument capable of meeting the modern requirements in\r\nexpressional power.\r\n\r\nThough the instrument itself lagged pitiably behind other instruments\r\nin development, Germany, France, and England continued to bring forth\r\ngreat organists. Wilhelm Friedemann Bach (1710-1784), the special\r\nfavorite of his father, was exceedingly talented as a performer and was\r\nconsidered the finest organist in Germany after his father’s death.\r\nHe was organist of the _Sophienkirche_ in Dresden (1733-1747) and of\r\nthe _Marienkirche_ in Halle (1747-1764). He had a great reputation\r\nfor improvisation, of which he was especially fond, and he wrote very\r\nlittle for the organ--chorale-preludes, trios, canons, and some fugues,\r\nof which the one in F major is especially notable.\r\n\r\nSeveral of Sebastian Bach’s pupils were famous organists in their\r\ntime and good composers. Johann Philip Kirnberger (1721-1783) wrote\r\nchorale-preludes and fugues, but is best known to the musical world by\r\nhis theoretical work, _Die Kunst des reinen Satzes_. Johann Frederick\r\nDoles (1715-1797) was cantor of the Thomas school in Leipzig from\r\n1756 to 1789. He wrote in rather popular vein and, strange indeed\r\nfor a pupil and successor of the great Cantor, actually demanded the\r\nbanishment of the fugal form from the church service. Johann Ludwig\r\nKrebs (1713-1780), whom Bach playfully called ‘_der einzige Krebs in\r\nmeinem Bache_’ (‘the only crab in my brook’), was considered by Bach to\r\nbe his best pupil. He wrote chorale-fugues, preludes, and fugues. His\r\nfugue in G major is still an attractive concert piece. Johann Schneider\r\n(1702-1787), organist at St. Nicholas’, Leipzig, gained great fame as\r\nan improvisator on the organ. Johann Christian Kittel (1732-1809),\r\nthe last pupil of Sebastian Bach, who brought his master’s traditions\r\ninto the nineteenth century, was organist at Erfurt from 1756 till his\r\ndeath. He was a famous player and teacher and an excellent composer.\r\nAmong his celebrated pupils were M. G. Fischer and J. C. H. Rinck.\r\n\r\nJohann Georg Albrechtsberger (1736-1809), famous as a theoretical\r\nwriter, composer, and teacher, was court-organist in Vienna (1772) and\r\nkapellmeister at St. Stephen’s (1792). For the organ he wrote eleven\r\nsets of fugues and three of preludes, but the vast majority of his 261\r\ncompositions are unpublished. His fame lingered longest as a theorist\r\nand among his pupils were names that later became celebrated--Seyfried,\r\nHummel, and Beethoven. Beethoven studied counterpoint with him, but he\r\nexpressed only a poor opinion of his pupil’s talent.\r\n\r\nGeorg Joseph Vogler (1749-1814), best known as Abbé Vogler and\r\nimmortalized in Robert Browning’s well-known poem of that name, was a\r\npupil of Padre Martini in Bologna and of Vilotti in Padua. After going\r\nto Rome he entered the priesthood, later returning to Germany and\r\nsojourning a few years in each of various places. He invented a system\r\nof simplification for the organ and applied it to a portable instrument\r\nwhich he called ‘orchestrion,’ with which he travelled over Europe as\r\nconcert-organist. One of his inventions was the so-called ‘resultant’\r\n16-foot tone, produced by uniting an 8-foot pipe with a 5-1/3-foot\r\n(‘quint’) pipe. This device gave rise to the ‘resultant’ 32-foot tone\r\nstill employed by some organ-builders. He also advocated discarding\r\nmixtures altogether. His compositions no longer possess interest. His\r\npresumption and self-confidence are well illustrated by the fact that\r\nhe published (Peters’, Leipzig, 1810) twelve chorales by Sebastian\r\nBach ‘corrected’ (_umgearbeitet_) by himself and analyzed by C. M. von\r\nWeber, who at that time was his pupil at Darmstadt.\r\n\r\nJohann Christian Heinrich Rinck (1770-1846) was a voluminous writer\r\nfor the organ. His compositions show fluent melody and clear form, and\r\nhis style is dignified and simple, but his ideas lack musical depth.\r\nHe was wise enough not to attempt to follow Bach in fugue writing,\r\nrecognizing, as he said to Fétis, that if he were ‘to succeed in\r\ncomposing anything worthy of approval, it must be on different lines\r\nfrom his (Bach’s).’ Rinck’s ‘Organ School’ is still well-known in\r\nEngland and America.\r\n\r\nMichael Gotthard Fischer (1773-1829), organist at Erfurt, was a\r\nmost excellent player and a composer of many organ-works--preludes,\r\nfantasias, chorale-preludes--that even to-day have not lost their\r\nattractiveness.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                   II\r\n\r\nJohann Gottlob Schneider (1789-1864) was one of the greatest German\r\norgan virtuosi of the nineteenth century and did a great deal to\r\npopularize organ-music by his many concert tours. His few published\r\nworks--fugues, fantasias, preludes--occupy an honorable place. Like so\r\nmany of the great organists of the earlier periods, he was famous for\r\nhis improvisation.\r\n\r\nAdolf Friedrich Hesse (1809-1863), organist of St. Bernard’s, Breslau,\r\nwas another celebrated and much admired organ virtuoso. He created a\r\nsensation by his performances, especially his pedal-playing, at the\r\ninauguration of the new organ at St. Eustache, Paris, in 1844. When\r\nlater he concertized in England (1852) he protested vigorously against\r\nthe unequal temperament of the English organs. He wrote preludes,\r\nfugues, fantasias, études--mostly practical works in clear form, with\r\nsmooth-flowing melody and simple, popular content.\r\n\r\nAugust Gottfried Ritter (1811-1885), organist of the cathedral in\r\nMagdeburg, was one of the greatest German organ masters of the last\r\ncentury, famous alike for his wonderful improvisation and as a\r\nvirtuoso. He wrote four fine sonatas for the organ, of which opus 19 in\r\nE minor and especially opus 23 in A minor (dedicated to Liszt) are of\r\ngreat value. Other works are chorale-preludes, fugues, and variations.\r\nOf greatest value are his _Kunst des Orgelspiels_, an instruction book\r\nin two volumes, and _Geschichte des Orgelspiels im 14-18 Jahrhunderts_,\r\nan admirable and scholarly scientific treatise, which has been freely\r\ndrawn upon, since its publication in 1884, by most writers on organ\r\nhistory.\r\n\r\nKarl August Haupt (1810-1891), organist of the Parochialkirche, Berlin\r\n(1849), and director of the Royal Academy of Church Music (1869),\r\nwas an organ master of the first rank, equally great as virtuoso and\r\nextempore player in the style of Bach, for whose works he was ever an\r\nenthusiastic propagandist. He published the organ works of Thiele,\r\nhis friend and predecessor at the Parochialkirche. He drew a host\r\nof American students to him. One of these, Mr. E. E. Truette in the\r\n_Étude_, is authority for the statement that they numbered over 150 and\r\nhe mentions the names of Eugene Thayer, Clarence Eddy, J. K. Paine,\r\nGeorge W. Morgan, Arthur Bird, and Philip Hale.\r\n\r\nFelix Mendelssohn-Bartholdy (1809-1847) was an organist of fine\r\nattainments and wrote most gratefully for the instrument. Himself a\r\nBach enthusiast and gifted with extraordinary contrapuntal facility,\r\nMendelssohn was the first composer for the organ after Bach to approach\r\nhim in the happy combination of nobility of musical ideas and technical\r\nfinish of workmanship. He has earned the gratitude of organists by his\r\nthree preludes and fugues (of which the ones in G major and C minor\r\nare possibly the best) and six sonatas, all free from pedantry and\r\nfull of refreshing melodic invention, romantic warmth of harmony, and\r\nin attractive technical garb. The preludes are less valuable than the\r\nsonatas. Four of the six sonatas have chorales for their principal\r\nthematic material and these are the most valuable of the six. In the\r\nuse of the chorale in his organ sonatas and his oratorios, Mendelssohn\r\nshows his close artistic kinship with the great Cantor; the chorale\r\nmade a deep appeal to him and stirred the flight of his imagination to\r\nfinest effort. These are sonatas only in name, the strict sonata-form\r\nnot being observed. In the powerful first movement of No. 1 (F minor),\r\nthe chorale _Was mein Gott will, gscheh allzeit_ (‘What my God wills,\r\nbe always done!’) is beautifully interwoven. The simple, expressive\r\nAdagio is followed by a very attractive Recitativo which leads into\r\nthe brilliant and dashing Finale. The Adagio of No. 2 (C minor) is of\r\nfinest beauty and the best movement of this sonata, which is clear\r\nin form and melodious, as Mendelssohn always is. No. 3 (A minor) has\r\nonly two movements, the first of grand effect, presenting an excellent\r\ndouble fugue on the chorale _Aus tiefer Not schrei ich zu dir_ (‘In\r\ndeep distress I cry to Thee’). No. 4 (B-flat major) is constructed\r\nwith four movements and is a brilliant, effective concert sonata,\r\nthe Allegretto (F major) being especially attractive and written in\r\nMendelssohn’s typical fluent manner. No. 5 (D major) is a beautiful\r\nwork throughout. In No. 6 (D minor) Mendelssohn uses the chorale _Vater\r\nunser im Himmelreich_ as the basis of four variations built up to a\r\ngreat climax and a fugue constructed on the first line of the chorale.\r\nThe Finale (D major) almost breathes vocal expression.\r\n\r\nRobert Schumann (1810-1856) was never an organist, but his interest in\r\ncontrapuntal study led him to write six fugues on the name B-A-C-H,\r\nof which No. 5, the little staccato fugue, is the most original. The\r\ncanons which he wrote as studies for pedal-piano are also suitable and\r\neffective for organ. Of these the B minor Canon is best known as an\r\neffective concert-piece.\r\n\r\nFranz Liszt (1811-1886) contributed very original and effective music\r\nfor the organ, most of which inclines towards orchestral effects\r\nand some of which opened up new possibilities for the organ, as his\r\ncompositions for piano did for that instrument. In addition he wrote\r\nmany smaller pieces (including transcriptions) for organ or harmonium,\r\nthat are harmonically most piquant. His best works for organ are:\r\nVariations on a Basso Ostinato (_Crucifixus_ of the B minor Mass\r\nby Bach), Prelude and Fugue on B-A-C-H, _Evocation à la Chapelle\r\nSixtine_, Litany: _Ora pro nobis_, and Fantasia and Fugue on _Ad nos,\r\nad salutarem undam_ (theme by Meyerbeer), this last being his greatest\r\nwork for organ.\r\n\r\nJohann Friedrich Ludwig Thiele (1816-1848) was organist of the\r\nParochialkirche, Berlin, from 1839 to 1848. Although his early\r\ndeath at the age of thirty-two prevented the full development of\r\nhis extraordinary genius, Thiele has left several very important\r\norgan-works--‘Chromatic Fantasy,’ written at the age of seventeen;\r\nthree concert-pieces, all majestic compositions; Theme and Variations\r\nin A-flat major and in C major, both brilliant and effective\r\nconcert-pieces.\r\n\r\nImmanuel Gottlob Friedrich Faisst (1823-1894), organist in Stuttgart\r\nand director of the Stuttgart Conservatory, published several organ\r\npieces; his Sonata in E major is a masterly work.\r\n\r\nThe career of Julius Reubke (1834-1858), the son of an organ-builder\r\nand a fine pianist and organist, was cut short by death when he was\r\nonly twenty-four years old. His only organ-work, a sonata entitled\r\n‘The 94th Psalm,’ is one of the grandest and most powerful works that\r\nhave ever been written for the instrument; its position in literature\r\nis really unique. It reveals the inexhaustible fantasy, the profound\r\ndepth, and the impetuous temperament of the young composer, who with\r\nsure hand molded his own form by breaking the old sonata-form. This\r\nmagnificent sonata introduced a new epoch, the orchestral treatment of\r\nthe organ. The early death of Reubke and Thiele was the most serious\r\nblow to modern progressive organ-music in Germany.\r\n\r\nGustav Adolf Merkel (1827-1885), a pupil of Johann Schneider and\r\norganist of the Kreuzkirche and Hofkirche in Dresden, was one of the\r\ngreatest organists and organ-composers of his period and he has left\r\nworks of great beauty and value, though much of his writing sounds dry\r\nand pedantic now. He wrote nine sonatas, one of them for two performers\r\nand double pedal. Of these sonatas the best are opus 42 in G minor and\r\nopus 118 in D minor. Other works are fantasias, preludes, and études.\r\nMerkel was a masterly contrapuntist and falls in the direct line of\r\nsuccession to Bach and Mendelssohn. His sonatas are on the whole the\r\nbest works of this class between Mendelssohn and Rheinberger.\r\n\r\nJohannes Brahms (1833-1897), the great master of German song and\r\nsymphony, gave a few valuable works to the organ: the very scholarly\r\nFugue in A-flat minor, Chorale-Prelude and Fugue on _O Traurigkeit, O\r\nHerzeleid_, and eleven chorale-preludes (his last work), of which two\r\ndeserve especial mention--_Es ist ein Ros’ entsprungen_ and _O Welt,\r\nich muss dich lassen_.\r\n\r\n\r\n                [Illustration: Modern Organ Composers:]\r\n           Top: Alexandre Guilmant and Charles Marie Widor\r\n               Bottom: Joseph Rheinberger and Max Reger\r\n\r\n\r\nJoseph Gabriel Rheinberger (1839-1901) easily takes rank as one\r\nof the best German organists and teachers of the latter part of the\r\nnineteenth century and at the same time one of the greatest organ\r\ncomposers of the century. From 1867 he was professor of composition\r\nand organ-playing in the Munich Conservatory and in 1877 was appointed\r\ndirector of the Court Church music in Munich. He has exerted a marked\r\ninfluence on music in America through his numerous pupils, among\r\nwhom may be mentioned Horatio W. Parker and George W. Chadwick. His\r\nmany-sided genius expressed itself in various fields--orchestral,\r\nchoral, church, chamber, pianoforte, and organ. In all of these\r\nfields he showed himself in close sympathy with modern harmonic\r\ndevelopment and tendencies, but, strange to say, not with Wagner’s\r\nmethods and theories; yet he combined with a progressive modern spirit\r\na mastery of fugal and contrapuntal forms equalled by none of his\r\ncontemporaries. While he avoided treating the organ orchestrally,\r\nhe was among the first to employ in organ-forms the rich harmonic\r\nvocabulary of the romantic composers who had already given to the\r\nliterature of the pianoforte and the orchestra so many masterpieces\r\nof warm and glowing tone-color. His organ compositions are pure music\r\nof an elevated type, equal in their own individual way with the best\r\norchestral art of his period. In most of Rheinberger’s music, however,\r\nthere is present a certain quality of reserve that never permits the\r\nexpression of exuberance of feeling or exalted enthusiasm. They reveal\r\nan astonishing variety, a fertile imagination, deep earnestness, and\r\ncomplete mastery of form and style. The most important of these works\r\nare two concertos for organ with orchestra in F major (opus 137) and\r\nG minor (opus 177), and twenty sonatas, which alone constitute a\r\nmonumental contribution to organ literature. Rheinberger seems to have\r\nattempted for the organ-sonata something of the same task of setting\r\nfree from the trammels of tradition and of developing along the line\r\nof its own inherent needs that Beethoven solved so successfully for\r\nthe pianoforte-sonata. These two forms of the sonata, however, have\r\nvery little in common and Rheinberger, in his remarkable series, gave\r\nthe strongest impetus to the development of the organ-sonata as a\r\ndistinct music-form since Mendelssohn’s noble works. The particular\r\nform which he seemed to adopt for it as a kind of type was in three\r\nmovements, the first being in the nature of a prelude, the last a fugue\r\nor some distinctly contrapuntal form, and the intervening movement an\r\nintermezzo in slow tempo. Most of his sonatas are constructed in this\r\nform, though occasionally he employs four movements, as in the Sonata\r\nin E minor, No. 8, where a Scherzoso appears between the Intermezzo\r\nand the final movement. He frequently uses with telling effect the\r\nmodern device of unifying the movements through the employment in the\r\nlast movement of themes heard in the first. In the Pastoral Sonata,\r\nNo. 3, the Eighth Gregorian Psalm Tone, upon which the opening\r\nmovement (Pastorale) is constructed, appears again with fine effect\r\nas a contrasting subject to the fugal theme in the last movement.\r\nPlain-song melodies frequently appear in his earlier sonatas. Many of\r\nthe sonatas--especially No. 8 (opus 132) in E minor, No. 9 (opus 142)\r\nin B-flat minor (dedicated to Guilmant), No. 12 (opus 154) in B-flat\r\nmajor, No. 14 (opus 165) in C major, and No. 20 (opus 196) in F--are\r\namong the noblest examples of organ-music. Among his shorter organ\r\ncompositions of large value are Twelve Characteristic Pieces, many\r\ntrios for two manuals and a pedal, besides several pieces for organ and\r\nviolin.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                   III\r\n\r\nFrench organ-music presents very little interesting material for the\r\nhistorian to dwell upon until after the middle of the nineteenth\r\ncentury, when a new stimulus broke in upon the dreary triviality which\r\nhad been so long its chief characteristic. The most important French\r\norganist of the last half of the eighteenth century was Nicolas Séjan\r\n(1745-1819), who was appointed organist of Nôtre Dame in 1772, of St.\r\nSulpice in 1783, of the Invalides in 1789, and of the Chapel Royal in\r\n1814. Carlyle in his ‘French Revolution’ relates a thrilling experience\r\nthrough which this organist passed at the hands of the revolutionists\r\nin 1793, when they seized the church of Nôtre Dame and made it the\r\nscene of a sacrilegious orgy of unusually revolting character.\r\nDemoiselle Candeille, a dancer from the Opéra, was established at\r\nthe altar as the Goddess of Reason and La Harpe harangued the crowd,\r\ndeclaring all religion abolished. As a crowning defiance to traditional\r\nreligion this was followed by a ball, at which Séjan was forced to play\r\ndance-music on the great cathedral organ as the howling rabble danced\r\nand shouted street songs.\r\n\r\nAlexandre Pierre François Boëly (1785-1858) was a musician of most\r\nserious aims and made persistent efforts to acquaint Frenchmen with\r\nthe works of Bach and other great composers for the organ, but with no\r\nsuccess. For several years he was organist at St. Germain l’Auxerrois,\r\nParis, but his zeal in serving his own high artistic ideals cost him\r\nhis position. He wrote four offertories and many other pieces for organ.\r\n\r\nFrançois Benoist (1794-1878), organist of the Royal Chapel and\r\nprofessor of organ-playing at the Conservatoire from 1819, left twelve\r\nbooks of organ works entitled _Bibliothèque de l’Organiste_. Pieces\r\nfrom this collection that have been reprinted, presumably the best, are\r\nin the prevailing sentimental and trivial style of this period. He was\r\nthe organ-teacher of Saint-Saëns.\r\n\r\nJust before the middle of the nineteenth century a movement for the\r\nrestoration of Catholic church-music was inaugurated in Bavaria\r\nby Dr. Karl Proske (1794-1861), and Ratisbon became the centre of\r\nthis movement. A collateral movement for the reform of plain-song\r\nwas started by the ‘Benedictines of Solesmes,’ an order of the\r\n‘Congregation of France’ founded at this monastery in 1833 by Dom\r\nProsper Guéranger. Two French organists who had taken holy orders\r\nallied themselves to this latter movement and aided greatly in the\r\nreformation of church-music, especially by their writings on the\r\nrelation of the organ to plain-song and on other aspects of Gregorian\r\nmusic. These were Louis Lambillotte (1797-1857) and Théodore Nisard,\r\nthe pen name of Abbé Xavier Normand (born in 1812).\r\n\r\nThe first of the modern French organists to have any perceptible\r\ninfluence on present-day organists was Louis James Alfred Lefébure-Wély\r\n(1817-1869), who was organist at the Madeleine, Paris, from 1847 to\r\n1858 and of St. Sulpice from 1863 till his death. He was a thorough\r\nmusician, a skillful performer on the organ and piano, and a composer\r\nin many fields. He was regarded as possessing marvellous powers of\r\nimprovisation and his compositions for a time enjoyed great popularity\r\n(‘The Monastery Bells’ was the best known of his salon-music for\r\npianoforte). Much of his organ-music partakes of the nature of his\r\n‘fashionable’ pianoforte-music; it is light, if not trivial, and is\r\nvery melodious, but, despite its former great popularity, devoid of\r\nartistic value. However, his name frequently appears on present-day\r\norgan recital programs.\r\n\r\nAntoine Édouard Batiste (1820-1876), organist of St. Nicolas des Champs\r\n(1842-1854) and of St. Eustache (1854-1876), was a fine teacher,\r\none of the best performers of his time, and a prolific composer of\r\norgan music, much of which, however, is of the popular, tuneful,\r\near-tickling, and easy-to-play variety. Several of his nearly 300\r\ncompositions rise above this level and, though showy and somewhat\r\nsentimental, are excellent for their type. Few organ compositions have\r\nhad such widespread popularity as some of Batiste’s, as, for example,\r\nthe Communion in G, the Offertory in E, and several of the ‘Grand\r\nOffertories,’ including the St. Cecilia Offertories, among the best\r\nknown of which are the ones in D minor, C minor, and F. The vogue of\r\nBatiste is by no means full-spent, but the gradually widening demand\r\nfor organ-music of a more serious nature and a finer workmanship is\r\nautomatically lessening the appeal of such music, which is merely\r\nsensuously pleasing.\r\n\r\nMuch more serious in artistic purpose and effective in healthy\r\ninfluence was Nicolas Jacques Lemmens (1823-1881), an eminent Belgian\r\norganist and composer who early came under the influence of German\r\norgan-music while a student of Adolph Hesse at Breslau, whither he\r\nwas sent at government expense. Here he spent a year in study (1846),\r\ncultivating a deep love for Sebastian Bach and acquiring the traditions\r\nof his great organ-works. When he returned to Belgium, he carried\r\nwith him a testimonial from his teacher, stating that he could play\r\nBach as well as he himself did. As professor of organ-playing at the\r\nBrussels Conservatory (1849-1858) he exerted a wide influence and in\r\n1879 founded a school at Malines, Belgium, under the auspices of the\r\nBelgian clergy for the training of Catholic organists and choirmasters.\r\nAmong his famous pupils were Guilmant and Widor. He wrote many\r\nexcellent organ compositions, about sixty in all, including sonatas\r\n(especially the Sonata Pontificale), offertories, fantasias, etc.,\r\nand his instruction book _École d’Orgue_ was adopted in the Paris and\r\nBrussels Conservatoires and in other schools; but his chief influence\r\nwas in laying the foundations of a more serious style of organ-music in\r\nFlanders and France. He was far more successful than Boëly in arousing\r\ninterest in Bach and he astonished the French by his fine playing of\r\nthe great German master’s organ works. His example in this direction\r\nwas followed by many of the most distinguished French organists,\r\nas Franck, Saint-Saëns, Widor, Guilmant, Salomé--all of whom were\r\nenthusiastic worshippers of the genius of the Leipzig cantor. The most\r\nwidely known of Lemmens’ organ pieces, though by no means the best, is\r\nprobably the Fantasia in D minor, popularly called ‘The Storm.’\r\n\r\nJan Albert van Eijken or Eyken (1823-1868), a distinguished Dutch\r\norganist in Amsterdam and later in Elberfeld, received his musical\r\neducation at the Leipzig Conservatory and later, at Mendelssohn’s\r\nsuggestion, under Johann Schneider at Dresden. He wrote important\r\nworks of great merit for the organ, including three sonatas, of which\r\nthe third in A minor deserves special mention, twenty-five preludes,\r\na large number of chorale-preludes, a toccata and fugue on B-A-C-H,\r\nand other pieces, all in the elevated style of German Protestant\r\norgan-music.\r\n\r\nSamuel de Lange (born 1840) is another Dutch organist and composer who\r\nwas celebrated in Germany, Austria, France, and England as a concert\r\nperformer. He taught successively in the Music Schools of Rotterdam\r\nand Basel, and in the Conservatories of Cologne (1876) and Stuttgart\r\n(1893). He wrote seven organ-sonatas and many smaller pieces--all\r\ncontaining valuable music.\r\n\r\nThree modern Belgian organists have achieved substantial reputations.\r\nAlphonse Jean Ernest Mailly (born 1833), ‘first organist to the King,’\r\nbecame known as a brilliant virtuoso and teacher (in the Brussels\r\nConservatory from 1868), and the composer of many compositions for the\r\norgan, among them fantasias, characteristic pieces, and a much-played\r\nsonata. His pupil, Edgar Tinel (1854-1912), wrote one valuable work\r\nfor the organ, Sonata in G minor, of which the Finale is especially\r\nvigorous in content and treatment. In 1881 he succeeded Lemmens as\r\ndirector of the Institute for Sacred Music at Malines and in 1896\r\naccepted an appointment as teacher of counterpoint and fugue in the\r\nBrussels Conservatory. His fame as composer rests more largely on\r\nhis choral and church music. Joseph Callaerts (1838-1901), a native\r\nof Antwerp and a pupil of Lemmens at the Brussels Conservatory, was\r\norganist of the Cathedral of Antwerp and teacher of organ in the Music\r\nSchool from 1867. Some of his organ-music borders on the popular, yet\r\nmuch of it possesses dignity, if not great depth of thought.\r\n\r\nThe greatest figure in French organ-music is César Auguste Franck\r\n(1822-1890). What Sebastian Bach is to German musical art, Franck is to\r\nFrench--the great Gothic cathedral architect in tones. By virtue of his\r\nworks, which in many respects overshadow everything before or after him\r\nin French organ literature, and the beneficent effect of his personal\r\ninfluence, which included within its radius many of the greatest of\r\npresent-day French composers, Franck was an epoch-making personality\r\nand the spiritual head of a new French school which has powerfully\r\neffected French music since his time. A deep sincerity, religious in\r\nits intensity, coupled with a certain indefinable mysticism, pervades\r\nall of his compositions. Never writing for effect or applause and\r\npossessing a Bach-like fondness and capacity for intricate polyphonic\r\nstructure joined with an extremely modern freedom in his use of\r\nharmonies, Franck created works of sublime beauty that will live long\r\nafter the works of many of his now famous contemporaries are forgotten.\r\nHis abilities as an organist (he had the reputation of being a fine\r\none) were overshadowed by his compositions, but he was professor of\r\norgan-playing at the Paris Conservatoire and organist at St. Clotilde\r\nfrom 1872 till his death.\r\n\r\nHis organ works are not numerous, but they are exceedingly important,\r\nconsisting of three sets of pieces.[111] In the first set of six\r\npieces, No. 2, _Grande Pièce Symphonique_ in F-sharp minor, is\r\nappropriately called symphonic. Its themes are noble and full of\r\ndeepest expression, and are developed with consummate mastery, while\r\nthe harmonic scheme is always novel and fascinating. No. 3--Prelude,\r\nFugue, and Variations in B minor--is a work of the first rank and\r\ndisplays to fine advantage his mastery of the resources of the organ\r\nand the technical means of expression. The Pastorale in E major, No. 4,\r\nis an especially interesting and grateful concert-piece and the Finale,\r\nNo. 6, is brilliantly built up to a powerful climax. In a second set,\r\nconsisting of three chorales, though all are valuable, the best are the\r\nfirst one in E major with its beautiful melodic lines and its ingenious\r\nharmonic effects, and the third one in A minor, which is Bach-like in\r\nits imposing dignity. The third set comprises three effective concert\r\nnumbers--Fantasia in C major, which again reveals his indebtedness\r\nto Bach in the skill with which he superimposes a most expressive\r\ntheme upon a delicately constructed canon, Cantabile in B major, and\r\n_Pièce Héroique_. Of these the best is the Cantabile with its rich and\r\ninteresting harmonies and expressive melodies. Despite the marvellous\r\nbeauty and noble power of Franck’s musical thoughts, one cannot refrain\r\nfrom the occasional wish that he had exercised more conciseness in\r\ntheir development. At the organ he was a dreamer of seraphic visions\r\nand he sometimes forgot that his listeners were apt to be uninspired\r\nmortals.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                   IV\r\n\r\nThe reluctance of English organ-builders, referred to in a previous\r\nchapter, to adopt the mechanical improvements introduced into\r\nContinental organs, naturally retarded the progress of English\r\norgan-music. After Handel, although England had good organists, little\r\nof value was produced in organ composition until almost the present\r\ngeneration. Excellent compositions were written in the style of Handel\r\nand, later, of Mendelssohn, but originality in musical material or\r\ntreatment was almost wholly absent.\r\n\r\nThe best English organists and organ-composers of the eighteenth\r\ncentury were the following: Dr. Thomas Arne (1710-1778), William Boyce\r\n(1710-1779), John Stanley (1713-1786), a remarkable organist who\r\nwas blind from the age of two and yet who distinguished himself as\r\ncomposer, performer, and teacher; James Nares (1715-1783), Benjamin\r\nCooke (1734-1793), in one of whose fugues the pedal takes the subject,\r\nan unusual procedure in English organ-music of this century; Thomas\r\nSanders Dupuis (1733-1796), one of the best organists of his time;\r\nJonathan Battishill (1738-1801), a remarkable extempore performer; John\r\nChristmas Beckwith (1751-1809), also famous for his improvisations; and\r\nCharles Wesley (1756-1834), a nephew of the great Methodist leader. The\r\nmusical forms employed by these organist-composers (all of the above\r\nwrote more or less for the organ except Boyce, Arnold, and Battishill)\r\nwere chiefly concertos and fugues in the style of Handel, and\r\nvoluntaries. In the time of Dupuis a form of voluntary came into vogue\r\nthat soon became stereotyped, conventional, and banal. It consisted\r\nof three or four movements usually in this order--a slow movement in\r\nthree-pulse rhythm for the diapasons, a solo for cornet or trumpet with\r\naccompaniment of bass only, and closing with a fugue. The first two\r\nmovements were almost invariably uninteresting and dull, but the fugues\r\nshowed that English composers of the period could acquit themselves\r\ncreditably in forms that demanded learning rather than originality and\r\nmusical feeling.\r\n\r\nSamuel Wesley (1766-1837), brother of the Charles Wesley mentioned\r\nabove, was the foremost English organist of his time and the first\r\nreally great figure in English organ-music. He was a fine extempore\r\nplayer, the composer of much excellent organ-music (11 concertos and\r\na large number of voluntaries, interludes, preludes, and fugues),\r\nand a close student and ardent admirer of Bach. From 1800 he was a\r\nmost zealous and persistent propagandist for the German master’s\r\nworks and especially excelled as a performer of his fugues. As he was\r\nan excellent violinist, Bach’s violin works also received frequent\r\nperformances in public concerts at his hands. The first English edition\r\nof the ‘Well-tempered Clavichord’ was published by him in 1810 in\r\ncollaboration with C. F. Horn and he was instrumental in procuring the\r\npublication of an English translation of Forkel’s life of Bach. His\r\nmusic is more serious than the prevalent style and while he is not a\r\ngreat composer, judged by Continental standards, his influence was\r\nfar-reaching and of utmost importance to English musical life, in that\r\nhe gave substantial dignity to the organ as an interpreting instrument\r\nand induced a widespread interest in more solid organ-music, especially\r\nin Bach.\r\n\r\nEarly in the nineteenth century ‘arrangements’ began to be made for\r\norgan from other works, vocal and instrumental, chiefly of German and\r\nItalian classical composers. One of the earliest to start this custom\r\nwas John Clarke-Whitfeld (1770-1836), organist of Hereford Cathedral\r\nand professor of music at Cambridge University. His arrangements were\r\nfrom the vocal works of Handel (1809), and as a substitute for the\r\nability to create original music, they presented worthy compositions\r\nof a contrapuntal character suitable for organists to perform. But the\r\narranging of pieces for the organ soon extended to other kinds of vocal\r\nmusic, to symphonies and forms of instrumental music quite foreign to\r\nthe nature and idiom of the instrument, and this practice developed\r\ninto a craze for arrangements and adaptations which lasted throughout\r\nthe nineteenth century and which still persists, especially in England\r\nand America.\r\n\r\nWilliam Crotch (1775-1847) was a prominent organist and composer whose\r\nappointments were mostly at Oxford. He wrote concertos for organ with\r\norchestral accompaniment and fugues for the organ alone, and made many\r\nadaptations of Handel’s oratorios for the organ. He was evidently a\r\nscholarly composer, for some of his themes were carefully phrased,\r\nan unusual procedure for his time. Crotch was one of the earliest to\r\nindicate the exact tempo he desired for his music by such mechanical\r\nmeans as a swinging pendulum. In a footnote to an Introduction and\r\nFugue on a subject by Muffat, written in 1806, he says: ‘A pendulum of\r\ntwo feet length will give the time of a crotchet (quarter-note).’ About\r\ntwenty-five years later Maelzel’s metronome was beginning to be known\r\nin England, and, when he published some fugues and canons in 1835, he\r\nindicated the tempo by such comments as ‘Crotchet equals a pendulum of\r\nsixteen inches; Maelzel’s metronome, 92.’\r\n\r\nIt will be of interest in this connection to note an earlier method of\r\ndetermining the tempo of a piece by the ingenious device of comparison\r\nwith the duration of the pulse-beat. Johann Joachim Quantz (the music\r\nteacher of Frederick the Great), in his _Anweisung die Floete zu\r\nspielen_ (1752), gives the following interesting table for determining\r\nthe rate of speed:\r\n\r\n‘In ordinary time (measure),\r\n\r\n_Allegro assai_, for every half-measure, the time of one beat of the\r\npulse,\r\n\r\n_Allegretto_, for every quarter-note, the time of one beat of the pulse,\r\n\r\n_Adagio cantabile_, for every eighth-note, the time of one beat of the\r\npulse,\r\n\r\n_Adagio assai_, for every eighth-note, the time of two beats of the\r\npulse.’\r\n\r\nVincent Novello (1781-1861), the founder of the well-known publishing\r\nhouse of Novello and a celebrated organist and composer, wrote no\r\norgan-music, but his name became familiar to every English organist\r\nthrough his ‘Cathedral Voluntaries,’ These were motets and anthems\r\nby the old English church writers, such as Gibbons, Blow, and Tye,\r\narranged for organ use, much as the early Venetian organists arranged\r\nthe motets and sacred madrigals of their time for keyboard instruments.\r\n\r\nEnglish organ-music continued to be either obvious imitation of\r\nHandel, Mozart, Haydn, and, after 1845, Mendelssohn, or arrangements\r\nand adaptations of German classical music. Thomas Adams (1785-1858),\r\nnoted for his improvisations; Sir John Goss (1800-1880), the greatest\r\nchurch musician of his time and organist of St. Paul’s Cathedral for\r\nthirty-four years; Samuel Sebastian Wesley (1810-1876), son of Samuel\r\nWesley mentioned above, who, like his father, was an enthusiastic\r\nadmirer of Bach’s works and an exceptionally fine extempore player,\r\nand who for a time was considered the finest organist in England--all\r\nwrote voluntaries, interludes, fugues, and andantes for organ in this\r\nstyle, though some of their anthems and ‘services,’ particularly those\r\nof Wesley, belong to the finest examples of English church-music of any\r\nperiod.\r\n\r\nHenry Smart (1813-1879), who became blind about 1864 and henceforth\r\nwas compelled to dictate his compositions to an assistant, was\r\nan exceptional organist and a composer who displayed many modern\r\nqualities of interesting harmony in advance of most of his English\r\ncontemporaries. He wrote voluminously for the organ--fifty preludes\r\nand interludes, andantes (especially the one in A major), marches,\r\nvariations, and postludes.\r\n\r\nEdward John Hopkins (1818-1901), for nearly sixty years organist of\r\nTemple Church, London, possessed the sterling qualities of the best\r\nEnglish organists and exerted a wide influence through his church-music\r\nand particularly his book, ‘The Organ: Its History and Construction,’\r\nwritten in conjunction with Dr. E. F. Rimbault (1816-1876), which has\r\nlong enjoyed the distinction of being a standard work on this subject.\r\n\r\nWilliam Spark (1823-1897), a pupil of S. S. Wesley, was a celebrated\r\nrecitalist and from 1860 organist of Leeds Town Hall. While holding\r\nan appointment at St. George’s, Leeds, he had organized the People’s\r\nConcerts, the popularity of which had led to the erection of the Town\r\nHall. A magnificent instrument of four manuals and 110 stops was\r\ninstalled in it and dedicated in 1859, and soon thereafter Dr. Spark\r\nreceived the appointment of borough organist and for years he gave two\r\npublic recitals on it each week. He was a noted lecturer and writer\r\non musical subjects and from 1869 till his death was editor of ‘The\r\nOrganists’ Quarterly Journal,’ devoted to original compositions. His\r\ncompositions (a Fantasia, a Sonata in D minor, and other pieces) were\r\nstrongly influenced by Mendelssohn, whose music was now the model for\r\nall English musicians as Handel’s had been in the years preceding\r\nMendelssohn’s advent.\r\n\r\nSir Frederick Arthur Gore Ouseley (1825-1889) presents the unusual\r\nspectacle of an amateur musician rising to the important position\r\nof professor of music at Oxford University and becoming one of the\r\nmost influential musicians in the United Kingdom. Though an excellent\r\norganist and composer for organ, he never held a position as organist.\r\nHe devoted a considerable fortune to the founding and maintenance of a\r\nchurch[112] in which the musical service was of the highest order and a\r\ncollege for the special training of choristers. Through these channels\r\nand his Oxford professorship he wielded a large influence on the young\r\nchurch musicians of his time. His organ compositions--eighteen preludes\r\nand fugues, a sonata, three andantes, etc.--were for the most part in\r\nthe style of Mendelssohn.\r\n\r\nThe first place among English concert-organists was long held by\r\nWilliam Thomas Best (1826-1897), who was one of the greatest virtuosos\r\nof the nineteenth century. For nearly forty years (from 1855 to\r\n1894) he was organist of St. George’s Hall, Liverpool, where his\r\nrecitals became a feature of the city’s musical life and gained for\r\nhim an international reputation. An event in his life that attracted\r\nworld-wide notice was his journey in 1890 to Sydney, Australia, where\r\nhe inaugurated the mammoth organ in the new Town Hall with a series of\r\ntwelve recitals. This organ, the largest in the world, has five manuals\r\nand 126 speaking stops. He published several valuable contributions\r\nto organ-literature--six concert-pieces, a Sonata in D, a Toccata\r\nin A, several fantasias and fugues on English Psalm-tunes, and many\r\npreludes on Psalm-tunes in the style of Bach’s chorale-preludes, etc.\r\nHe was best known, however, through his admirable ‘Organ Arrangements\r\nfrom the Great Masters,’ his editions of Handel’s organ-concertos and\r\nMendelssohn’s and Bach’s organ-works, and his two text-books, ‘The Art\r\nof Organ-Playing’ and ‘Modern School for the Organ.’\r\n\r\nOf recent years composers in England have been less exclusively\r\noccupied with choral and church music, for the so-called musical\r\nrenaissance, which is now bringing England once more to the forefront\r\nof musical nations, is due largely to the deeper interest composers\r\nhave been taking in the modern orchestral idiom, the impressionistic\r\ntendencies of contemporary instrumental music and the nationalistic\r\nexpression which owes its impulse to the recent folk-song revival\r\nmovement. Nevertheless meritorious works for the organ continue to\r\nbe produced by most of the present-day English composers, and more\r\nespecially by men like Alan Gray, A. M. Goodhart, Ernest Halsey, James\r\nLyon, T. Tertius Noble, C. B. Rootham and W. Wolstenholme.\r\n\r\n\r\n                              FOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[111] Edition Durand, Paris.\r\n\r\n[112] The college and church of St. Michael and All Angels, Tenbury,\r\nWorcestershire, of which he was rector in addition to his Oxford\r\nprofessorship, were dedicated in 1856.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                             CHAPTER XVII\r\n\r\n                          MODERN ORGAN MUSIC\r\n\r\n     Supremacy of modern French organ music; Saint-Saëns;\r\n     Guilmant: sonatas and smaller works--Widor: organ symphonies;\r\n     Dubois; Gigout and other French organ-writers--German\r\n     organ composers; Piutti; Klose; Reger: chorale-fantasias;\r\n     Karg-Elert and others--Organ music in Italy; Capocci; Bossi;\r\n     Busoni and others--English organ composers since 1850--Organ\r\n     music in the United States; early history; Dudley Buck;\r\n     Frederick Archer and Clarence Eddy; contemporary American\r\n     organ composers.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                   I\r\n\r\nIt is always an interesting and fruitful task to dive beneath the\r\nsurface of historical events and discover the contributing causes that\r\nhave led to the supremacy of certain nations at certain periods in\r\ncertain departments of musical activity. For the past three decades\r\nat least, French organ-music has occupied a position of supremacy\r\nin certain important respects, among which may be named brilliance\r\nof technical finish, glowing variety of tone-colors as expressed in\r\nskillfully thought-out registration, interesting and piquant rhythmical\r\nfiguration and melodic outline, combined with modernity of harmonic\r\ntreatment. A group of elder composers, of whom Saint-Saëns, Guilmant,\r\nWidor and Dubois are the chief ornaments, laid the solid foundation\r\nof this school into which they were careful to build a deep and\r\nintelligent appreciation of Bach’s organ art, which had only recently\r\nbeen transplanted into France. Rooted in such a fertile soil French\r\nvivacity and lightness of feeling took on a deeper color and a richer\r\nluxuriance that combined substance with beauty of external expression.\r\nIn this genial and healthy atmosphere the younger generation of French\r\norganists have lived and from its stimulating nourishment they have\r\ndeveloped many fascinating traits of strong and virile individualism.\r\n\r\nCharles Camille Saint-Saëns (born 1835), the Nestor of French\r\ncomposers, has demonstrated an unusual versatility in composition\r\nand has contributed to nearly every field of musical activity. He is\r\nnot only a great pianist but also an organist of great ability and\r\nfrom 1858 to 1870 was the organist at the Madeleine, Paris, where\r\nhe became famous for his improvisations and his many excellences as\r\na performer. Under the spell of his imagination the organ becomes a\r\nflexible and elastic instrument of which he demands pianistic lightness\r\nand orchestral richness of color. In this respect the few organ\r\nworks of Saint-Saëns stand at the head of all French contributions\r\nto organ literature. Freedom from all scholastic tradition and the\r\nimprovisation-like character of most of his organ works make them\r\nhighly interesting. The Fantaisie in D-flat major (opus 101), his best\r\nwork, is appropriately named, for it is music without prearranged\r\nplan and is harmonically most piquant, especially the ending with its\r\ndescending harmonies over an organ-point. His three Rhapsodies are all\r\nbrilliant and attractive concert-pieces, as are also his Preludes.\r\nOnly in the Fugues associated with these Preludes does Saint-Saëns, in\r\ncommon with all French composers except César Franck, fall short--the\r\nfugue is essentially the property of German art.\r\n\r\nFelix Alexandre Guilmant (1837-1911), one of the most celebrated\r\nFrench organ composers and virtuosos, extended his fame by many concert\r\ntours throughout Europe and two in the United States (in 1893 and\r\n1903). The larger part of his compositions is for organ. These show\r\nrich, fluent melody, always clear form and a rare skill in utilizing\r\nthe possibilities of organ tone-color. The popularity of his works\r\namong organists is enhanced by the moderate technical demands required\r\nfor their performance. Guilmant possessed astonishing facility in\r\nimprovisation (an interesting feature on most of his concert programs)\r\nand won the admiration and respect of musicians of all countries by his\r\npropaganda for the classical masters. His historical recitals at the\r\nTrocadéro during the Paris Exposition of 1878 attracted international\r\nnotice and later he published a large and valuable collection entitled\r\n_Archives des maîtres de l’orgue_. From 1871 to 1902 he was organist at\r\nLa Trinité, Paris, which position he gained by his remarkable playing\r\nat the inauguration of the organs at St. Sulpice and Nôtre Dame. His\r\norgan compositions are numerous and highly original. The most important\r\nof them are the eight sonatas. Of these the first sonata in D minor,\r\nopus 42, is the favorite one among organists and the finest in breadth\r\nof conception and unity of construction. It is grateful, effective\r\nconcert music, very clear in form and typically French in invention.\r\nThe first movement is powerful and majestic, the Pastorale tender and\r\nmost expressive, and the Finale a brilliant display-piece with its\r\ntoccata-like motive. This sonata is also published as a symphony for\r\norgan and orchestra--a most impressive work. Sonata No. 3 in C minor,\r\nopus 56, is a fine work with an excellent Finale (Fugue). Sonata No.\r\n5 in C minor, opus 80, possesses a strong, passionate first movement,\r\nan effective Scherzo with its ingenious little staccato fugato and a\r\nFinale that is one of Guilmant’s best and most forceful movements.\r\nThe sonata is dedicated to Clarence Eddy and in the last movement\r\nthe composer ingeniously and tactfully builds his theme from the\r\ninitials of his own name and that of the American organist--C-G-E-A.\r\nThe sixth sonata, opus 86. is a beautiful work in all its movements.\r\nSonata No. 8 in A major, opus 91--he calls it ‘Symphony for organ and\r\norchestra’--has an especially attractive Scherzo and the Finale is\r\nbrilliant and strong.\r\n\r\nBesides the sonatas, Guilmant has written prolifically in smaller\r\nforms and in various styles, in all of which he makes excellent\r\npractical use of the possible effects of the instrument for which his\r\nmusic is so well adapted. The ‘Fugue in D’ is one of the strongest\r\nFrench fugues and shows how deeply he had lived into Bach’s favorite\r\nform. The ‘Religious March’ is cleverly constructed on a theme from\r\nHandel’s ‘Messiah’ and is built up with an original secondary subject\r\n(a smooth, brilliant fugato) to an imposing climax. The ‘Funeral March\r\nand Seraphic Song’ enjoys deserved popularity. The Finale (‘Seraphic\r\nSong’) is especially notable with its double pedal effect (the melody\r\nbeing played with the right foot) and sparkling harp-like arpeggios\r\non the manuals. In all his writings Guilmant reveals a fanciful\r\nimagination and is always sure of good effect. In ‘Lamentation,’ for\r\nexample, he displays his artistic resourcefulness in transforming the\r\nsad march-like theme (in the pedal) of the first part into a theme of\r\nreligious consolation at the end (Hymn: _Jerusalem convertere_).\r\n\r\n\r\n                                   II\r\n\r\nCharles Marie Widor (born 1845), organist of St. Sulpice in Paris\r\nsince 1870, is the most distinguished of the living French organists\r\nand organ composers. Having succeeded César Franck as professor of\r\norgan-playing at the Conservatoire in 1890 and Dubois as professor\r\nof composition in 1896, he occupies a position of extraordinary\r\nimportance in contemporary French organ-music as composer, teacher\r\nand performer. While he is known in America almost exclusively by his\r\nactivities associated with the organ, he has written extensively for\r\nthe pianoforte, the voice and the orchestra (two symphonies, three\r\nconcertos, etc.) and much in chamber-music forms. His best writings for\r\norgan are ten symphonies which together constitute one of the noblest\r\ngifts that any composer has ever made to organ literature. In these\r\nworks he shows himself a thoroughly representative French composer,\r\ncombining all the brilliant qualities of the modern French school.\r\nInfluenced somewhat by Liszt and Berlioz in his earlier works (the\r\nfirst series of symphonies), he represents the finest progress in the\r\nFrench art of organ-playing in the last three decades.\r\n\r\nHis first eight organ symphonies (in reality sonatas) were published\r\nin two series--opus 13 (Nos. 1-4) and opus 42 (Nos. 5-8). These are\r\nin a class by themselves and deserve especial attention and study.\r\nThe title ‘symphony’ is often justified in the enlarged form used\r\nand in the elaborate development of individual movements. Most of\r\nthem contain from four to six movements. In the first symphony in C\r\nminor the best movements are the first, second and fifth. The first\r\ntwo movements of the second in D are the most attractive. No. 3 in E\r\n(a kind of suite, consisting of Prelude, Minuet, March, Canon, Fugue\r\nand a brilliant Finale) is the easiest of the symphonies and of less\r\nimportance than the others. No. 4 is excellent throughout, the first\r\nand fourth being possibly the best movements. The first of the second\r\nseries of symphonies--No. 5 in F--is probably the most popular of the\r\nten among organists, since it possesses the double merit of being fine,\r\ninspiring music and at the same time offering excellent opportunity\r\nto display both the performer and the resources of the modern organ\r\nto good advantage--especially in the first movement (_Allegro vivace_\r\nin variation form), in the second (_Allegro cantabile_) and in the\r\n_Finale_ (Toccata) with its brilliant staccato technique. No. 6 is\r\nmusically far superior to No. 5 and is one of the most masterly works\r\nin the entire organ literature, the first movement being particularly\r\nimposing in its breadth and grandeur of conception, and the second\r\nrich in noble sentiment. In No. 7 the fourth and last movements are\r\nespecially interesting. No. 8 is one of the most beautiful of Widor’s\r\nworks--the first movement being of brilliant effect and the second full\r\nof musical warmth.\r\n\r\nIn addition to these eight, Widor has written the _Symphonie Gothique_\r\nin C minor, opus 70, and the _Symphonie Romane_ in B minor, opus 73.\r\nThe former is one of his most notable compositions; in the first\r\nmovement sombre-hued, suppressed emotion is portrayed in a most\r\ninteresting harmonic garb, while the fine melodic line of the second\r\nmovement forms effective contrast, and the Finale displays brilliant\r\ntechnical features. In the first movement of the _Symphonie Romane_\r\nthere is a very ingenious and original elaboration of a Gregorian chant\r\nused as theme. The Cantilena (third movement) is lovely music and the\r\nFinale brilliant and dashing. The _Symphonia Sacra_, opus 83, is a\r\nmassive work for organ and orchestra constructed on a theme borrowed\r\nfrom the melody of the old Latin hymn of St. Ambrose (fourth century),\r\n_Veni redemptor gentium_, a hymn which Martin Luther translated for\r\nJohann Walther’s _Gesangbuch_ (1524) under the title of _Nun komm der\r\nHeiden Heiland_. Upon this chorale (which Bach has also used in several\r\nof his organ preludes) Widor builds up a mighty Gothic cathedral in\r\ntones, in the construction of which organ and orchestra vie with each\r\nother in supplying vital plastic material. The employment of the\r\nchorale in this modern French work, coming as it does contemporaneously\r\nwith Reger’s remarkable Chorale-Fantasias in Germany, is evidence that\r\nthe resources of the old church-chorale have not been exhausted and\r\nthat the classic circle beginning with Pachelbel and Bach has expanded\r\nits circumference to embrace congenial masters from any country; and\r\nhere the modern Frenchman, Widor, touches elbows with the German,\r\nReger. This interesting work was given its first American performance\r\nby Wilhelm Middelschulte with the Chicago Symphony Orchestra in\r\nFebruary, 1911.\r\n\r\nClément François Théodore Dubois (born 1837), organist at the\r\nMadeleine from 1877 to 1896 (succeeding Saint-Saëns) and director of\r\nthe Conservatoire, after Ambroise Thomas’ death, from 1896 to 1905,\r\noccupies a respected position as an organ composer. Much of his best\r\ncomposition, however, is in other fields. His shorter organ pieces\r\nare numerous and generally effective, especially for church use.\r\nHis melodies are mostly noble and fluent and his harmony modern and\r\ninteresting, inclining toward orchestral effects. The pedal part\r\nfrequently lacks independence. These compositions are so well known\r\nthat it would be superfluous to name more than a few of the more\r\nfamiliar ones: _Messe de Marriage_, _Fiat Lux_, ‘Hosanna,’ ‘March\r\nof the Magi’ (with the highest B held through the entire piece,\r\nrepresenting the star in the East), and _In Paradisum_.\r\n\r\nEugène Gigout (born 1844), organist of St. Augustin and director of an\r\norgan school in Paris, is one of the first names among French writers\r\nfor organ. He inclines more to the classical style than do most of\r\nhis French colleagues. Among his best pieces are _Prière en form de\r\nPrélude_, _Pèlerinage_, _Andante varié_, _Marche religieuse_, _Marche\r\nfunèbre_, _Andante Symphonique_.\r\n\r\nThéodore César Salomé (1834-1896), for many years second organist at La\r\nTrinité, is best known by his Sonata in C minor, an effective work.\r\n\r\nSamuel Alexandre Rousseau (1853-1904), pupil of César Franck and\r\nchapel-master of St. Clotilde, Paris, wrote valuable compositions for\r\nthe organ that show much creative power. Of these the _Double Thème\r\nvarié_ is the best.\r\n\r\nLeon Boëllmann (1862-1897) was a fine organist in Paris, the full\r\ndevelopment of whose artistic powers was prevented by his early death.\r\nHe was nearly equally successful in all styles of composition, leaving\r\nno less than sixty-eight published works. The _Suite Gothique_ in\r\nC minor is his most popular organ work. He also wrote a _Fantaisie\r\ndialoguée_ for organ and orchestra.\r\n\r\nFerdinand de la Tombelle (born 1854), a pupil of Guilmant and Dubois\r\nat the Conservatoire at Paris, has written much organ music that has\r\nenjoyed a measure of popularity both in England and America.\r\n\r\nThe school of younger French organ composers shows a well-defined\r\ntendency to adopt an impressionistic style, without losing, however,\r\nthe characteristically French brilliance, grace and melodic charm.\r\nAmong its leaders will be found Joseph Bonnet (born 1884 at Bordeaux),\r\norganist at St. Eustache and Guilmant’s successor at the Paris\r\nConservatoire. Other young French composers are A. Maquaire, a pupil\r\nof Widor, whom he assists at St. Sulpice; Charles Quef, organist at La\r\nTrinité; J. Ermand Bonnal, and others.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                   III\r\n\r\nGermany always has been, and still is, the special champion of\r\nintellectual organ music, as France has been of brilliant, melodious\r\nand colorful organ music. Bach and the churchly function of the organ\r\nhave been the two factors in German organ music that have determined\r\nits lines of development almost up to the present. The concert organ\r\nplaced in public halls, that has been such a prominent element in the\r\ndevelopment of organ music and its popular appreciation in France,\r\nEngland and America through the giving of concerts or recitals, has\r\nonly recently made its appearance in Germany. There the organ is\r\nstill a church, not a recital, instrument. Then, too, modern German\r\norgan-builders have been much slower than either French, English or\r\nAmerican builders in adopting mechanical improvements. Until very\r\nrecently an organ suitable for the adequate performance of a monochrome\r\nBach fugue has been the ideal of the German builder, and at the opening\r\nof the twentieth century there were hundreds of such organs in large\r\nGerman churches, with eighteenth-century mechanical appliances. The\r\n‘swell-box’ was not adopted until late in the nineteenth century; and\r\nthe wonderful development in nineteenth-century German orchestral art\r\nfound echoes only here and there in German organ music. In the past\r\nthree decades, however, some magnificent modern instruments have been\r\ninstalled in Germany and there are already abundant evidences that a\r\nprogressive spirit has taken firm hold upon its organ-builders and its\r\norgan-music. At present Germany possesses but few composers for the\r\norgan whose works have exerted large influence, but these are very\r\nimportant in their relation to the development of organ music.\r\n\r\nCarl Piutti (1846-1902) was born in Elgersburg, Thuringia, and educated\r\nat the Leipzig Conservatory, where he taught from 1875 until his death.\r\nAfter 1880 he was organist at the Thomas Church. Of his comparatively\r\nfew organ compositions, his Sonata in G minor, opus 22, deserves\r\nspecial mention; it is imposing in its proportions and is one of the\r\nmost brilliant examples of modern German organ art.\r\n\r\nErnst Hans Fährmann (born 1860), organist of the Johanneskirche in\r\nDresden, is an excellent composer for his instrument. His best work is\r\nSonata in C major, opus 22; the Sonata in A minor, opus 18, is also a\r\nbrilliant and effective work.\r\n\r\nFriedrich Klose (born 1862 in Karlsruhe, lives in Munich) has written\r\nmuch for orchestra with organ, but has contributed one important\r\nwork for organ alone--Prelude, Double Fugue and Chorale (Chorale at\r\nthe conclusion for 4 trumpets and 4 trombones). This work, which is\r\ndedicated to Anton Bruckner, had its origin in an improvisation by\r\nBruckner in Bayreuth. Klose, an enthusiastic admirer of the Viennese\r\nmaster, uses the theme of Bruckner in building up an imposing, powerful\r\nwork--very impressive in the introduction and majestic in its great\r\nclimax (over an organ-point of thirty measures).\r\n\r\nMax Reger (born 1873 at Brand, Bavaria) is the greatest living master\r\nof organ composition. Astounding mastery over the technical side of\r\ncomposition (he is probably the greatest contrapuntist since Bach),\r\nwonderful richness in his harmonic formations, and a phenomenal power\r\nof expression, are some of his admirable traits. He is the leader\r\nof the ultra-modern German school and, though still a comparatively\r\nyoung man, is one of the most prolific writers in all musical history.\r\nOf his first hundred opuses, twenty-two are for organ, each ranging\r\nin size from a set of from four to ten pieces to a sonata or a\r\nchorale-fantasia. He is a distinct innovator in his harmonic scheme,\r\nbut is often accused of lacking warmth. Intensely modern in his\r\nharmonic feeling, his novel harmonies do not spring so much from chord\r\nmovement in the ordinary sense as from the happy sounding together of\r\nindependently moving melodies. The influence of his exuberant polyphony\r\nis everywhere felt in his writings. He is clearly an intellectualist\r\nand his art appears at its highest in the most complicated structures,\r\nsuch as the chorale-fantasias and variations, where he presents\r\nmovements of sublimest beauty and greatest depths, as only a great\r\nmaster can.\r\n\r\nThe chorale-fantasias of Reger cultivate a new field, suggested,\r\nhowever, by Sebastian Bach in his one example, _O Lamm Gottes,\r\nunschuldig_, where he composes three verses, not variations. The\r\ncharacteristic is that each verse, according to the poetic suggestion\r\nof the text, assumes an entirely original form, but all are organically\r\nmolded into one whole. At the end there usually appears a colossal\r\nfugue, where the melody of the chorale is interwoven with the themes\r\nof the fugue. His great chorale-fantasias are: _Ein’ feste Burg_;\r\n_Freu’ dich sehr, O meine Seele_; _Wie schön leuchtet der Morgenstern_;\r\n_Straf mich nicht in deinem Zorn_; _Alle Menschen müssen sterben_;\r\n_Wachet auf, ruft uns die Stimme_. Next in importance come the Fantasia\r\non B-A-C-H, opus 46, and the Symphonic Fantasia and Fugue, opus 57.\r\nThere are two sonatas--opus 33 in F-sharp minor and opus 60 in D\r\nminor--and several sets of short pieces. Among the latter group several\r\nof the Monologues (opus 63), and several of both opus 59 (Benedictus\r\nand Pastorale in particular) and opus 69 are favorite numbers with\r\nrecitalists.\r\n\r\nSigfrid Karg-Elert (born 1878, lives in Leipzig), though a young man,\r\nis an important figure in German music of to-day. He has already\r\npublished over a hundred works and they bear the stamp of talent of the\r\nhighest order. He is a modernist of pronounced, sometimes extravagant,\r\ntype in his harmonic feeling and combines with this a brilliant style\r\nof expression. His Passacaglia in E-flat minor is a scholarly work;\r\nthe Sonatina No. 1 in A minor, opus 74, is built on large lines,\r\nnotwithstanding the title; of his groups of smaller pieces, some of\r\nthe better known are Three Impressions, opus 72 (‘Moonlight,’ ‘Night’\r\nand ‘Harmonies of Evening’), and Ten Characteristic Pieces, opus 86\r\n(_Prologus Tragicus_, ‘Impression,’ ‘Canzona,’ etc.).\r\n\r\nThe most prominent of living Danish composers for the organ is\r\nOtto Malling (born 1848, living in Copenhagen), whose works are\r\nboth numerous and strikingly individual. The majority of his organ\r\ncompositions take the form of mood-pictures inspired by biblical\r\nsubjects, most of which centre around the life and times of Christ, as\r\nthe ‘Holy Virgin’ suite of six pieces, opus 70 (‘The Annunciation,’\r\n‘Mary visits Elizabeth and praises God,’ ‘The Holy Night,’ etc.).\r\n\r\n\r\n                                   IV\r\n\r\nUntil the last quarter of the nineteenth century organ music in Italy\r\nhad remained practically where Frescobaldi had left it. Very little\r\nprogress had been made during the intervening two centuries either\r\nin organ music or in organ-building. Musical Italy was almost wholly\r\nabsorbed in vocal music and the opera. Church music had sunk to\r\nlamentable depths of triviality and secularity. Independent organ music\r\nreceived only the slightest attention and absolute stagnation reigned.\r\nWhen Guilmant, in the eighties of the last century, opened the new\r\norgan in the church of St. Louis des Français in Rome by giving daily\r\nrecitals for two weeks, he gave many of the well-known Bach and Handel\r\nworks their first performance in Italy! Even now there are very few\r\nmodern organs in Italy. The names of Italian organists, therefore, are\r\nvery few in number, even when the present generation is reached.\r\n\r\nIn the eighteenth century only one Italian organist stands out with any\r\nprominence, Francesco Antonio Vallotti (1697-1780), chapel-master of\r\nthe Church of San Antonio in Padua. He was recognized as a great writer\r\nof church-music and Tartini, his contemporary, spoke in warmest terms\r\nof his playing. He was the teacher of the famous Abbé Vogler.\r\n\r\nMarco Santucci (1762-1843), _maestro_ of the cathedral at Lucca, wrote\r\n12 fugued sonatas for organ and Vincenzo Antonio Petrali (1832-1889)\r\nhad a great reputation as an improvisator and virtuoso.\r\n\r\nOf the living Italian organists the most prominent and influential\r\nare Capocci and Bossi, both of whom have striven valiantly to bring\r\nItalian organ-art back to the place of eminence it occupied in the\r\nearly centuries. The elder of these musicians, Filippo Capocci (born\r\n1840), has been the organist of St. John Lateran in Rome since 1875\r\nand his organ is said to be the finest in Italy. He is not only a\r\nfine performer, but also a gifted composer of serious aims. He has\r\nwritten six sonatas and twelve volumes of original organ-pieces, mostly\r\nattractive and valuable. The sonatas are his best works, in which he\r\nfollows classical lines.\r\n\r\nEnrico Marco Bossi (born 1861) was organist of the Cathedral of Como\r\nfrom 1881 to 1891, in 1896 he was appointed director of the _Liceo\r\nBenedetto Marcello_ in Venice, in which institution he also taught\r\norgan and advanced composition, and since 1902 he has been director of\r\nthe _Liceo Musicale_ in Bologna. He is Italy’s greatest organist to-day\r\nand has also been a prolific writer in many fields--organ as well as\r\nchoral, orchestral and chamber music. His fine inventive genius, bold\r\nharmonic feeling and originality of design, coupled with a certain\r\nseverity of style, are well illustrated in his best works--a concerto\r\nfor organ and orchestra, opus 100 (especially the first movement of\r\nwhich is built up to a powerful climax), two sonatas (opus 60 and\r\nopus 77), and a large number of compositions in smaller forms, such\r\nas Marche Héroique, Étude Symphonique, Toccata, Romanza, Idylle, Hora\r\nMystica, Scherzo in G minor, etc. In 1893 with Tebaldini he published\r\n‘A School of Modern Organ-Playing,’ which is a standard work.\r\n\r\nOreste Ravanello (born 1871), organist of St. Mark’s, Venice (1892),\r\nand director of music of Antonius Basilica in Padua (1898), is to be\r\nnamed among the best Italian writers of the present. His Fantasia in F\r\nminor is an effective concert number.\r\n\r\nLorenzo Perosi (born 1872) was appointed by Pope Leo XIII musical\r\ndirector of the Sistine Chapel in 1898 and has written trios and\r\npreludes for the organ.\r\n\r\nFerruccio Benvenuto Busoni (born 1865 at Florence), the profound\r\nBach scholar, has made the most important contribution to modern\r\norgan literature by an Italian--the _Fantasia contrapuntistica_ (on a\r\nfragment by Sebastian Bach). Bach’s last unfinished work was intended\r\nas a fugue with four themes, but only the first, second and part of\r\nthe third fugues were left. What the fourth theme was to be, remained\r\na mystery until the well-known theorist Bernhard Ziehn (1845-1912)\r\nof Chicago solved it convincingly, thus showing the possibilities of\r\nBach’s fragment. With this suggestion Busoni has accomplished the\r\ngigantic task with admirable result. The work really consists of seven\r\nfugues, three of them being variations (a new idea in this form) of the\r\npreceding fugues. It exists in three versions: for piano by Busoni;\r\nfor organ, transcribed by Wilhelm Middelschulte; and for orchestra\r\nand organ, transcribed by Frederick Stock, conductor of the Chicago\r\nSymphony Orchestra. As an organ piece it is the most difficult work in\r\nthe entire organ literature.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                   V\r\n\r\nAbout 1850 the widespread dissatisfaction of English organists\r\nwith the crude and incomplete instruments of the period began to\r\nhave an appreciable effect on English organ-builders. In the years\r\nsoon following the middle of the century notable improvements were\r\nmade--larger and more complete organs were built, pedals were more\r\ncommon in church organs and complete pedal-boards were introduced, the\r\nobsolete ‘unequal temperament’ system of tuning was generally discarded\r\nand the ‘swell to tenor G’ half-keyboard was discontinued. When these\r\nnecessary improvements were made, English organ art advanced rapidly\r\nand an array of eminent organists came into view whose united labors as\r\nperformers and composers brought the organ into its present position of\r\ngreat influence in England and made possible the fine achievements of\r\nthe present generation of younger British organists and organ-composers.\r\n\r\nProminent in this group are the names of Sir Herbert Stanley Oakley\r\n(1830-1903), professor of music at Edinburgh University from 1865\r\nto 1891 and regarded as a player of exceptional ability and a good\r\ncomposer; George Mursell Garrett (1834-1891), organist to Cambridge\r\nUniversity and the composer of much church and organ music; Edmund\r\nHart Turpin (born 1835), for many years regarded as one of England’s\r\ngreatest concert organists; Sir John Stainer (1840-1901), one of the\r\nmost prominent English musicians of his day, organist at St. Paul’s,\r\nLondon (1872-1888), professor of music at Oxford University from 1889\r\nand composer of many sacred cantatas and much church and organ music\r\nof serious character; Sir Walter Parratt (born 1841), since 1883\r\nprofessor of organ at the Royal College of Music and since 1893 master\r\nof music to the royal household; Albert Lister Peace (born 1844), a\r\nfine organ-virtuoso, the successor (1897) of W. T. Best as organist\r\nof St. George’s Hall, Liverpool, which is regarded as one of the best\r\nappointments in the United Kingdom; Sir John Frederick Bridge (born\r\n1844), organist of Westminster Abbey from 1882, composer of much good\r\nchurch music and the author of text-books on counterpoint and organ\r\naccompaniment; and Sir George C. Martin (born 1844), organist of St.\r\nPaul’s Cathedral, London, after 1888 and a distinguished writer of\r\ndignified music for the church service.\r\n\r\nThe best known of the younger generation of English organists and\r\norgan-composers in America is Edwin Henry Lemare (born 1865), who is\r\ngenerally regarded as Best’s legitimate successor in the organ-concert\r\nfield. He first attracted large notice by his recitals while organist\r\nof St. Margaret’s, London. His reputation in the United States\r\nwas greatly increased during his two years’ tenure of the post of\r\norganist of Carnegie Institute, Pittsburg (1902-1904), and by several\r\nextended concert tours before and after that appointment. In his organ\r\ncompositions, which are very numerous, he cultivates mostly a ‘light’\r\nor ‘popular’ style, though his writing reveals a facile command of the\r\nmeans of musical expression. His Symphony in D minor is his largest\r\nwork and it is a brilliant, strong composition.\r\n\r\nWilliam Wolstenholme (born 1865), though blind from birth, has attained\r\na high place for himself both as a performer (he made a short tour in\r\nthe United States in 1908) and as a composer of exquisite invention.\r\nOver sixty of his compositions for organ are published, including two\r\nsonatas. Alfred Hollins (born 1865) is also a blind organist, whose\r\ncompositions for the organ have the same qualities of lovely melody and\r\ninteresting harmony. He lives in Edinburgh, Scotland.\r\n\r\nWilliam Faulkes, organist of St. Margaret’s church, Anfield, Liverpool,\r\nEngland, is a prolific writer of organ music of the ‘attractive’ type.\r\n\r\nSir Edward Elgar (born 1857) has written very little for the organ. His\r\nSonata in G, opus 28, is important, however. The ‘Pomp and Circumstance\r\nMarch,’ so popular with organists, is an arrangement from a march for\r\nmilitary band written for the festivities of the Coronation of Edward\r\nVII, played for the first time at the Promenade Concert, London, Oct.\r\n22, 1901.\r\n\r\nBasil Harwood (born 1859) is a composer of serious aims and ample\r\ntechnical equipment. His organ works include a Sonata in C-sharp minor\r\nand ‘Pæan.’ Other prominent English organ composers of the present\r\ngeneration are Julius Harrison, now living in London, Hugh Blair and\r\nPurcell J. Mansfield.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                   VI\r\n\r\nThe history of organ music in the United States is difficult of\r\ncomparison with that of European countries, for its development\r\nhere has been so recent. Organ-building on a large scale did not\r\nbegin until about 1850 and organ-music of intrinsic value by native\r\ncomposers did not appear until a couple of decades later. But since\r\nthen progress in every branch of organ art has been truly remarkable,\r\nand this cumulative development has atoned in large measure for earlier\r\nbackwardness and slowness. In the quality of both organ-building and\r\norgan-music produced in this country at the present time, American\r\nachievement need not shun comparison with the best contemporary\r\nEuropean efforts.\r\n\r\nThe rapidly increasing popularity of the organ as a recital instrument\r\nin America is traceable to several causes. At the foundation, of\r\ncourse, is the widely diffused public appreciation of good music\r\nof all kinds, fostered and stimulated by the annual flood of\r\nconcerts--orchestral, choral and chamber-music--and by the recitals\r\nof individual artists in every field that are given even in cities of\r\ncomparatively small size. But two causes have contributed particularly\r\nto the appreciation of organ music: (1) the rapid progress that has\r\nbeen made in the last twenty-five years by American organ-builders in\r\nall matters pertaining to mechanical appliances and tone-quality, with\r\nthe result that magnificent instruments are now to be found in almost\r\nevery city in the land, some of which are in public halls, municipally\r\nowned and maintained for purposes of public culture; and (2) a notable\r\nimprovement in the standards of organ-playing and general musicianship\r\namong organists themselves. A factor of large importance in this\r\nmovement has been the activity of the American Guild of Organists,\r\nmodelled after the Royal College of Organists in London and founded\r\nin 1896 in New York City ‘to raise the standard of efficiency of\r\norganists by examinations in organ playing, in the theory of music and\r\nin general musical knowledge; and to grant certificates of Fellowship\r\nand Associateship to members of the Guild who pass such examinations.’\r\n(Excerpt from the Constitution of this Guild.) This Guild now (1915)\r\nnumbers among its members over 1600 prominent organists in the United\r\nStates and Canada. Part of its regular propaganda is the giving of\r\npublic services and organ recitals of high musical quality.\r\n\r\nThe first organ in America was the famous old Brattle organ, imported\r\nand left by Thomas Brattle, treasurer of Harvard College, by his\r\nwill in 1713 to the Brattle Square Church, Boston. But since the\r\nchurch voted that it was not proper ‘to use said organ in the public\r\nworship of God,’ it was erected in King’s Chapel, Boston, in 1714,\r\nwhere it remained until 1756. For eighty years after this date it was\r\nin constant use in St. Paul’s Church, Newbury. It was then sold to\r\nSt. John’s Church, Portsmouth, New Hampshire. It was in existence in\r\n1901, when it was displayed at an exhibition of musical instruments\r\nin Horticultural Hall, Boston. This historically interesting old\r\ninstrument had only six stops.\r\n\r\nJohn Clemm is said to have erected the first American built organ in\r\nTrinity Church, New York, in 1737. This organ had three manuals and 26\r\nstops and was followed eight years later by a two-manual organ built\r\nby Edward Bromfield in Boston. Until the days of the Revolution it was\r\nin the Old South Church, but was burned during the siege of Boston.\r\nMany other small organs were built or imported for the larger churches,\r\nbut organ-building in America may properly be said to begin with the\r\nerection in 1853 of the large four-manual organ with seventy stops and\r\n3096 pipes, by Hook and Hastings in Tremont Temple, Boston. This was\r\nan organ of concert proportions and others soon followed in the large\r\ncities; chief among these early large organs were the one erected in\r\nBoston Music Hall (completed in 1863) and the one in the Cincinnati\r\nMusic Hall in 1878.\r\n\r\nAmerican organists of the eighteenth and first half of the nineteenth\r\ncenturies have no particular interest for us, save as mere historical\r\nreference. About the middle of the last century, however, coincident\r\nwith the widespread awakening of popular interest in musical matters,\r\nthere appeared a number of young organists, all of them with European\r\ntraining (mostly at Leipzig), who were well-equipped to handle a large\r\norgan and to play the organ music of the classical masters. Among these\r\npioneers appear prominently the names of James Cutler Dunn Parker (born\r\n1828), Benjamin Johnson Lang (1837-1909), and Samuel Parkman Tuckerman\r\n(1819-1890), among the group of Boston organists; George Washbourne\r\nMorgan (1823-1892), an Englishman who came to New York in 1853 and\r\nwho was considered the first concert-organist in America; John Henry\r\nWillcox (1827-1875), a native of Georgia, educated at Trinity College,\r\nHartford, Conn., and for the rest of his life an organist in Boston;\r\nEugene Whitney Thayer (1838-1889), for many years organist at Music\r\nHall, Boston; George William Warren (1828-1902), a self-taught musician\r\nwho was for thirty years organist of St. Thomas’s in New York; and John\r\nKnowles Paine (1839-1906), from 1876 professor of music at Harvard\r\nUniversity, who was one of the first, if not the first, American\r\nconcert-organist who measured up to German standards of classical organ\r\nplaying.\r\n\r\nAmerican organ music, however, begins with Dudley Buck (1839-1909),\r\nfor he was not only a performer of finest attainments, but was the\r\nfirst American composer to gain general recognition, and among his best\r\ncompositions are some large works for organ. For three years preceding\r\nthe great Chicago fire of Oct. 9, 1871, he was organist of St. James’s\r\nChurch in that city and for twenty-five years (1877-1902) he was\r\norganist of Holy Trinity Church, Brooklyn. His organ compositions show\r\nthe influence of classical models, expressed in fluent, pleasing melody\r\nand attractive harmony with an always clear sense of form. His best\r\norgan-works include two sonatas (in E-flat, opus 22, and in G minor,\r\nopus 77), Concert Variations on ‘The Star Spangled Banner,’ and many\r\nsmaller pieces, such as the familiar Idylle, ‘At Evening.’ In addition\r\nhe wrote a great deal of church music with organ accompaniment. From\r\nthe pedagogical side his work was equally valuable, including ‘18\r\nPedal-Phrasing Studies’ and ‘Illustrations in Choir-Accompaniment, with\r\nHints on Registration,’ the latter of which is still of great practical\r\nvalue to organists.\r\n\r\nThe number of fine concert-organists increased so rapidly since those\r\nnamed above that no attempt will be made here even to enumerate them.\r\nThe field of concert-organists cannot be passed over, however, without\r\nmention of two of their number whose influence, especially in the\r\ntransitional years of the last two decades of the last century, was\r\nenormous in creating an interest in, and love for, good organ music.\r\nThese organists are Frederick Archer (1838-1901) and Clarence Eddy\r\n(born 1851), both organ-virtuosos of the first rank, whose numerous\r\nand extended recital tours brought them into every part of the United\r\nStates. Archer, who gained his first laurels as organist at Alexandra\r\nPalace, London, came to America in 1880 and became organist in Boston,\r\nBrooklyn, Chicago, and finally (1896) in Pittsburg where he served as\r\ncity organist and musical director of Carnegie Music Hall. Clarence\r\nEddy’s playing has brought him an international fame; he now (1915)\r\nresides in Chicago as concert-organist, teacher and writer.\r\n\r\nPassing to the group of organ-composers, the endeavor will be made\r\nto name some of those--and a few important ones will doubtless be\r\nomitted where a choice must be made from a list that is increasing so\r\nrapidly--who have made substantial contributions to organ literature\r\nin the larger and more serious forms. This will of necessity leave\r\nuntouched a multitude of worthy organ pieces of lighter vein that have\r\nalready found much favor with organists.\r\n\r\nIn the front rank of American composers who have written worthily for\r\nthe organ Arthur Foote (born 1853) must be named. His compositions\r\nin this field are not many, but they are important for their solid\r\nmusicianship, clear form and eloquent melodic and harmonic expression.\r\nThey include a much-played Suite in D and many short characteristic\r\npieces. Arthur Foote has always lived in Boston.\r\n\r\nHoratio Parker (born 1863), who has made such large contributions\r\nto choral and vocal fields, has written also for the organ, but\r\nalmost exclusively in larger forms: Concerto in E-flat for organ and\r\norchestra, Sonata in E-flat, and five sets of concert pieces.\r\n\r\nHomer N. Bartlett (born 1845) is one of the most prolific of American\r\ncomposers in many fields and among his most important compositions are\r\nseveral organ works. His Suite in C, opus 205, is not only his most\r\nimportant organ composition, but it may well be named among the best\r\nAmerican organ compositions. He has been for many years a prominent\r\norganist of New York City.\r\n\r\nHorace Wadhams Nicholl (born 1848), an Englishman who came to America\r\nin the seventies, wrote 12 Symphonic Preludes and Fugues for organ,\r\nalso a symphonic poem called ‘Life’ in six movements, which display\r\nscholarly attainments and command of intricate forms of writing.\r\n\r\nJames Hotchkiss Rogers (born 1857), who has lived in Cleveland since\r\n1881, has written several notable things for his instrument, including\r\ntwo sonatas, a concert overture, and many small pieces.\r\n\r\nWilliam H. Dayas (1864-1903), though born in New York, went abroad when\r\na young man and, after studying with Haupt in Berlin, succeeded Busoni\r\nin Helsingfors and later moved to England where he died. He left two\r\nbrilliant organ sonatas--opus 5 in F major and opus 7 in C major.\r\n\r\nForemost among foreign-born organists and organ-composers who have\r\nmade America their home, must be named Wilhelm Middelschulte (born in\r\nWestphalia, 1863), who has been the organist of the Chicago Symphony\r\nOrchestra since 1894. His compositions are all in large contrapuntal\r\nforms and display complete mastery of Bach’s intricate art. They\r\ninclude a Passacaglia in D minor, a Concerto for organ and orchestra,\r\nCanonic Fantasie and Fugue on four themes by J. S. Bach, and Canons and\r\nFugue on the chorale _Vater Unser im Himmelreich_.\r\n\r\nAmong the large works of the earlier American composers that still\r\nsurvive are Eugene Thayer’s Sonata No. 5 in C minor, George E.\r\nWhiting’s Sonata in A minor and Henry M. Dunham’s two sonatas in F\r\nminor and G minor.\r\n\r\nThe number of organ works of really imposing proportions and\r\nsolid musical worth by American composers is quite significant of\r\nthe powerful undercurrents that are silently shaping the future of\r\nAmerican music. If one were to select the living composers who are\r\nrepresentative of the best present tendencies in organ composition\r\nin large forms in America, the following names, in addition to those\r\nmentioned above, would undoubtedly be among them: Mark Andrews,\r\nNew York; René Becker, St. Louis; Felix Borowski (born 1872, lives\r\nin Chicago); Rossetter Cole (born 1866, lives in Chicago); Gaston\r\nM. Dethier (born 1875 in Belgium, lives in New York); Gottfried H.\r\nFederlein, New York; Ralph Kinder (born 1876, lives in Philadelphia);\r\nWill C. Macfarlane (born 1870, city organist of Portland, Maine);\r\nRussell King Miller, Philadelphia; and Harry Rowe Shelley (born 1858,\r\nlives in New York).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                       LITERATURE FOR VOLUME VI\r\n\r\n                             _In English_\r\n\r\n     G.
