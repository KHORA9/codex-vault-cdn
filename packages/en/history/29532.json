Cowan, Esq.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_INTRODUCTORY_\r\n\r\n\r\nSo far as it concerns pictures painted upon panel or canvas in tempera\r\nor oils, the history of painting begins with Cimabue, who worked in\r\nFlorence during the latter half of the thirteenth century. That the art\r\nwas practised in much earlier times may readily be admitted, and the\r\nlife-like portraits in the vestibule at the National Gallery taken from\r\nGreek tombs of the second or third century are sufficient proofs of it;\r\nbut for the origin of painting as we are now generally accustomed to\r\nunderstand the term we need go no further back than to Cimabue and his\r\ncontemporaries, from whose time the art has uninterruptedly developed\r\nthroughout Europe until the present day.\r\n\r\nOddly enough it is to the Christian Church, whose early fathers put\r\ntheir heaviest ban upon all forms of art, that this development is\r\nalmost wholly due. The reaction against paganism began to die out when\r\nthe Christian religion was more firmly established, and representations\r\nof Christ and the Saints executed in mosaic became more and more to be\r\nregarded as a necessary, or at any rate a regular embellishment of the\r\nnumerous churches which were built. For these mosaics panel paintings\r\nbegan in time to be substituted; but it was long before any of the human\r\nfeeling of art was to be found in them. The influence of S. Francis of\r\nAssisi was needed to prepare the way, and it was only towards the close\r\nof the thirteenth century that the breath of life began to be infused\r\ninto these conventional representations, and painting became a living\r\nart.\r\n\r\nAs it had begun in Italy, under the auspices of the Church, so it\r\nchiefly developed in that country; at first in Florence and Siena, later\r\nin Rome, whither its greatest masters were summoned by the Pope, and in\r\nVenice, where, farther from the ecclesiastical influence, it flourished\r\nmore exuberantly, and so became more capable of being transplanted to\r\nother countries. In Germany, however, and the Low Countries it had\r\nappeared early enough to be considered almost as an independent growth,\r\nthough not till considerably later were the northern schools capable of\r\nsustaining the reputation given them by the Van Eycks and Roger Van der\r\nWeyden.\r\n\r\nBut for the effects of the Renaissance in Italy in the fifteenth century\r\nit is questionable whether painting would ever have spread as it did in\r\nthe sixteenth and seventeenth to Spain and France. But by the close of\r\nthe fifteenth century such enormous progress had been made by the\r\nItalian painters towards the realisation of human action and emotion in\r\npictures, that from being merely an accessory of religious\r\nestablishments, painting had become as much a part of the recognised\r\nmeans of intellectual enjoyment of everyday life as music, sculpture, or\r\neven the refinements of food and clothing.\r\n\r\nPortraiture, in particular, had gradually advanced to a foremost place\r\nin painting. Originally it was used exclusively for memorials of the\r\ndead--as we have seen in the case of the paintings from the Greek\r\ntombs--and on coins and medals. But gradually the practice arose, as\r\npainters became more skilful in representing the appearance of the\r\nmodel, of introducing the features and figures of actual personages into\r\nreligious pictures, in the character of \"donors,\" and as these increased\r\nin importance, the sacred personages were gradually relegated to the\r\nbackground, and ultimately dispensed with altogether. At the beginning\r\nof the sixteenth century we find Hans Holbein (as an example)\r\nrecommended by Erasmus to Sir Thomas More as a portrait painter who\r\nwished to try his fortunes in England; and during the rest of his life\r\npainting practically nothing but portraits.\r\n\r\nBy the end of the sixteenth century, if not earlier, painting had become\r\nalmost as much a business as an art, not only in Italy but in most other\r\ncountries in Europe, and was established in each country more or less\r\nindependently. So that making every allowance for the various foreign\r\ninfluences that affected each different country, it is convenient to\r\ntrace the development of painting in each country separately, and we\r\narrange our chapters accordingly under the titles of Tuscan and Venetian\r\n(the two main divisions of Italian painting), Spanish, Flemish, Dutch,\r\nGerman, French, and British Schools. In each country, as might be\r\nexpected--and especially in Italy--there are subdivisions; but, broadly\r\nspeaking, the lover of pictures will be quite well enough equipped for\r\nthe enjoyment of them if he is able to recognise their country, and\r\nroughly their period, without troubling about the particular district or\r\npersonal influence of their origin.\r\n\r\nFor while it is undoubtedly true that the more one knows about the\r\nhistory of painting in general the greater will be the appreciation of\r\nthe various excellences which tend to perfection, it is absolutely\r\nridiculous to suppose that only the learned in such matters are capable\r\nof deriving enjoyment from a beautiful picture, or of expressing an\r\nopinion upon it. In the first place, the picture is intended for the\r\npublic, and the public have therefore the best right to say whether it\r\npleases them or not--and why. And it may be noted as a positive fact\r\nthat whenever the public, in any country, have a free choice in matters\r\nof art, that choice generally turns out to be right, and is ultimately\r\nendorsed by the best critics. Most of the vulgar art to be found in\r\nadvertisements and the illustrated papers is put there by ignorant and\r\nvulgar providers, who imagine that the whole public are as ignorant and\r\nvulgar as themselves; whereas whenever a better standard of taste is\r\ngiven an opportunity, it never fails to find a welcome. Until Sir Henry\r\nWood inaugurated the present régime, the Promenade Concerts at Covent\r\nGarden were popularly supposed to represent the national taste in music.\r\nUntil the Temple Classics and Every Man's Library were published it was\r\ncommonly supposed that the people at large cared for nothing but Bow\r\nBells, the Penny Novelette, or such unclassical if alluring provender.\r\nIn the domain of painting, the Royal Academy has such a firm and ancient\r\nhold on the popular imagination of the English that its influence is\r\ndifficult to dispel; but there are many signs that its baneful\r\nascendency is at length on the decline; and it is well known that the\r\nNational Gallery is attracting more and more visitors and Burlington\r\nHouse less and less as the years go on.\r\n\r\nIn the following attempt at a general survey of the history of\r\npainting--imperfect or ill-proportioned as it may appear to this or that\r\nspecialist or lover of any particular school--I have thought it best to\r\nassume a fair amount of ignorance of the subject on the part of the\r\nreader, though without, I hope, taking any advantage of it, even if it\r\nexists; and I have therefore drawn freely upon several old histories and\r\nhandbooks for both facts and opinions concerning the old masters and\r\ntheir works. In some cases, I think, a dead lion is decidedly better\r\nthan a live dog.\r\n\r\nR. D.\r\n\r\nCHELSEA, 1914.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_TUSCAN SCHOOLS_\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI\r\n\r\nGIOVANNI CIMABUE\r\n\r\n\r\nBy the will of God, in the year 1240, we are told by Vasari, GIOVANNI\r\nCIMABUE, of the noble family of that name, was born in the city of\r\nFlorence, to give the first light to the art of painting. Vasari's\r\n\"Lives of the Painters\" was first published in Florence in 1550, and\r\nwith all its defects and all its inaccuracies, which have afforded so\r\nmuch food for contention among modern critics, it is still the principal\r\nsource of our knowledge of the earlier history of painting as it was\r\nrevived in Italy in the thirteenth century.\r\n\r\nMaking proper allowance for Vasari's desire to glorify his own city, and\r\nto make a dignified commencement to his work by attributing to Cimabue\r\nmore than was possibly his due, we need not be deterred by the very\r\nlatest dicta of the learned from accepting the outlines of his life of\r\nCimabue as an embodiment of the tradition of the time in which he\r\nlived--two centuries and a quarter after Cimabue--and, until\r\ncontradicted by positive evidence, as worthy of general credence. In the\r\npopular mind Cimabue still remains \"The Father of modern painting,\" and\r\nthough his renown may have attracted more pictures and more legends to\r\nhis name than properly belong to him, it is certain that Dante, his\r\ncontemporary, wrote of him thus:--\r\n\r\n    Credette Cimabue nella pintura\r\n    Tener lo campo, ed ora ha Giotto il grido\r\n    Si che la fama di colui s'oscura.\r\n\r\nThis is at least as important as anything written by a contemporary of\r\nWilliam Shakespeare; and even if we are required to believe that some of\r\nhis most important works are by another hand, his influence on the\r\nhistory of art is beyond question. Let us then follow Vasari a little\r\nfurther, and we shall find, at any rate, what is typical of the\r\ndevelopment of genius.\r\n\r\n\"This youth,\" Vasari continues, \"being considered by his father and\r\nothers to give proof of an acute judgment and a clear understanding, was\r\nsent to Santa Maria Novella to study letters under a relation who was\r\nthen master in grammar to the novices of that convent. But Cimabue,\r\ninstead of devoting himself to letters, consumed the whole day in\r\ndrawing men, horses, houses, and other various fancies on his books and\r\ndifferent papers--an occupation to which he felt himself impelled by\r\nnature.\"\r\n\r\nThis is exactly what is recorded of Reynolds, it may be noted, and very\r\nmuch the same as in the case of Gainsborough, Benjamin West--and many a\r\nmodern painter.\r\n\r\n\"This natural inclination was favoured by fortune, for the governors of\r\nthe city had invited certain Greek (probably Byzantine) painters to\r\nFlorence, for the purpose of restoring the art of painting, which had\r\nnot merely degenerated but was altogether lost. These artists, among\r\nother works, began to paint the chapel of the Gondi in Santa Maria\r\nNovella, and Cimabue, often escaping from the school, and having\r\nalready made a commencement of the art he was so fond of, would stand\r\nwatching these masters at their work. His father, and the artists\r\nthemselves, therefore concluded that he must be well endowed for\r\npainting, and thought that much might be expected from him if he devoted\r\nhimself to it. Giovanni was accordingly, much to his delight, placed\r\nwith these masters, whom he soon greatly surpassed both in design and\r\ncolouring. For they, caring little for the progress of art, executed\r\ntheir works not in the excellent manner of the ancient Greeks, but in\r\nthe rude modern style of their own day. Wherefore, though Cimabue\r\nimitated them, he very much improved the art, relieving it greatly from\r\ntheir uncouth manner and doing honour to his country by the name that he\r\nacquired and by the works which he performed. Of this we have evidence\r\nin Florence from the pictures which he painted there--as for example the\r\nfront of the altar of Saint Cecilia and a picture of the Virgin, in\r\nSanta Croce, which was and still is (_i.e._ in 1550) attached to one of\r\nthe pilasters on the right of the choir.\"\r\n\r\nUnfortunately the very first example cited pulls us up short alongside\r\nthe official catalogue of the Uffizi Gallery (where the picture was\r\nplaced in 1841), in which it is catalogued (No. 20) as \"Unknown ...\r\nVasari erroneously attributes it to Cimabue.\"\r\n\r\nTiresome as it may seem to be thus distracted, at the very outset, by\r\nthe question of authenticity, it is nevertheless desirable to start with\r\na clear understanding that in surveying in a general way the history and\r\ndevelopment of painting, it will be quite hopeless to wait for the final\r\nword on the supposed authorship of every picture mentioned. In this\r\ninstance, as it happens, there is no reason to question the modern\r\ncatalogue, though that is by no means the same thing as denying that\r\nCimabue painted the picture which existed in the church of S. Cecilia in\r\nVasari's time. Is it more likely, it may be asked, that Vasari, who is\r\naccused of unduly glorifying Cimabue, would attribute to him a work not\r\nworthy of his fame, or that during the three centuries since Vasari\r\nwrote a substitution was effected? The other picture, the _Madonna and\r\nChild Enthroned_, which found its way into our National Gallery in 1857,\r\nis still officially catalogued as the work of Cimabue, and it is to be\r\nhoped that this precious relic, together with the Madonnas in the\r\nLouvre, the Florence Academy, and in the lower church at Assisi, may be\r\nlong spared to us by the authority of the critics as \"genuine\r\nproductions\" of the beloved master.\r\n\r\nOn the general question, however, let me reassure the reader by stating\r\nthat so far as possible I have avoided the mention of any pictures, in\r\nthe following pages, about which there is any grave doubt, save in a few\r\ncases where tradition is so firmly established that it seems heartless\r\nto disturb it until final judgment is entered--of which the following\r\nexamples of Cimabue's reputed work may be taken as types. The latest\r\ncriticism seeks to deprive him of every single existing picture he is\r\nbelieved to have painted; those mentioned by Vasari which have perished\r\nmay be considered equally unauthentic, but, as before mentioned, his\r\naccount of them gives us as well as anything else the story of the\r\nbeginnings of the art.\r\n\r\nHaving afterwards undertaken, Vasari continues, to paint a large picture\r\nin the Abbey of the Santa Trinità in Florence for the monks of\r\nVallombrosa, he made great efforts to justify the high opinion already\r\nformed of him and showed greater powers of invention, especially in the\r\nattitude of the Virgin, whom he depicted with the child in her arms and\r\nnumerous angels around her, on a gold ground. This is the picture now in\r\nthe Accademia in Florence. The frescoes next described are no longer in\r\nexistence:--\r\n\r\n\"Cimabue next painted in fresco at the hospital of the Porcellana at the\r\ncorner of the Via Nuova which leads into the Borgo Ogni Santi. On the\r\nfront of this building, which has the principal door in the centre, he\r\npainted the Virgin receiving the Annunciation from the angel, on one\r\nside, and Christ with Cleophas and Luke on the other, all the figures\r\nthe size of life. In this work he departed more decidedly from the dry\r\nand formal manner of his instructors, giving more life and movement to\r\nthe draperies, vestments and other accessories, and rendering all more\r\nflexible and natural than was common to the manner of those Greeks whose\r\nwork were full of hard lines and sharp angles as well in mosaic as in\r\npainting. And this rude unskilful manner the Greeks had acquired not so\r\nmuch from study or settled purpose as from having servilely followed\r\ncertain fixed rules and habits transmitted through a long series of\r\nyears by one painter to another, while none ever thought of the\r\namelioration of his design, the embellishment of his colouring, or the\r\nimprovement of his invention.\"\r\n\r\nAfter describing Cimabue's activities at Pisa and Assisi with equal\r\ncircumstance, Vasari passes to the famous _Rucellai Madonna_, now\r\nsupposed to be by the hand of Duccio of Siena. However doubtful the\r\nstory may appear in the light of modern criticism, historical or\r\nartistic, it certainly forms part of the history of painting--for its\r\nspirit if not for its accuracy--and as such it can never be too often\r\nquoted:--\r\n\r\n\"He afterwards painted the picture of the Virgin for the Church of\r\nSanta Maria Novella, where it is suspended on high between the chapel of\r\nthe Rucellai family and that of the Bardi. This picture is of larger\r\nsize than any figure that had been painted down to those times, and the\r\nangels surrounding it make it evident that although Cimabue still\r\nretained the Greek manner, he was nevertheless gradually approaching the\r\nmode of outline and general method of modern times. Thus it happened\r\nthat this work was an object of so much admiration to the people of that\r\nday--they having never seen anything better--that it was carried in\r\nsolemn procession, with the sound of trumpets and other festal\r\ndemonstration, from the house of Cimabue to the Church, he himself being\r\nhighly rewarded and honoured for it. It is further reported, and may be\r\nread in certain records of old painters, that while Cimabue was painting\r\nthis picture in a garden near the gate of S. Pietro, King Charles the\r\nElder of Anjou passed through Florence, and the authorities of the city,\r\namong other marks of respect, conducted him to see the picture of\r\nCimabue. When this work was thus shown to the King, it had not before\r\nbeen seen by anyone; wherefore all the men and women of Florence\r\nhastened in great crowds to admire it, making all possible demonstration\r\nof delight.\"\r\n\r\nNow whether or not Vasari was right in crediting Cimabue with these\r\nhonours in Florence instead of Duccio in Siena, makes little difference\r\nin the story of the origin and early development of the art of painting.\r\nOne may doubt the accuracy of the mosaic account of the Creation, the\r\nauthorship of the Fourth Gospel or the Shakespearean poems, or the list\r\nof names of the Normans who are recorded to have fought with William the\r\nConqueror. But what if one may? The Creation, the poems and plays of\r\nShakespeare and the battle of Hastings are all of them historic facts,\r\nand neither science, nor literature, nor history is a penny the worse\r\nfor the loose though perfectly understandable conditions under which\r\nthese facts have been handed down to us. When we come down to times\r\nnearer to our own the accuracy of data is more easily ascertainable,\r\nthough the confusion arising out of them often obscures their real\r\nsignificance; but in looking for origins we are content to ignore the\r\ndetails, provided we can find enough general information on which to\r\nform an idea of them. To these first chapters of Vasari, then, we need\r\nnot hesitate to resort for the main sources of the earlier history of\r\npainting. Even so far as we have gone we have learnt several important\r\nfacts as to the nature of the foundations on which the glorious\r\nstructure was to be raised.\r\n\r\nFirst of all, it is apparent that the practice of painting, though\r\nstrictly forbidden by the earliest Fathers of the Church, was used by\r\nthe faithful in the Eastern churches for purposes of decoration, and was\r\nintroduced into Italy--we may safely say Tuscany--for the same purpose.\r\n\r\nSecond, that being transplanted into this new soil, it put forth such\r\nwonderful blossoms that it came to be cultivated with much more regard;\r\nand from being merely a necessary or conventional ornament of certain\r\nportions of the church, was soon accounted its greatest glory.\r\n\r\nThird, that it was accorded popular acclamation.\r\n\r\nFourth, that its most attractive feature in the eyes of beholders was\r\nits life-like representation of the human form and other natural\r\nobjects.\r\n\r\nProsaic as these considerations may appear, they are nevertheless the\r\nfundamental principles that underlie the whole of the subsequent\r\ndevelopment of painting; and unless every picture in the world were\r\ndestroyed, and the art of painting wholly lost for at least a thousand\r\nyears, there could not be another picture produced which would not refer\r\nback through continuous tradition to one or every one of them. First,\r\nthe basis of religion. Second, the development peculiar to the soil.\r\nThird, the imitation of nature. Fourth, the approbation of the\r\npublic--there we have the four cardinal points in the chart of painting.\r\n\r\nIt would be easy enough to contend that painting had nothing whatever to\r\ndo with religion--if only by reference to the godless efforts of some of\r\nthe modernists; but such a contention could only be based on the\r\nimperfect recognition of what religion actually means. In Italy in the\r\nthirteenth century, as in Spain in the seventeenth, it meant the Church\r\nof Rome. In Germany of the sixteenth, as in England in the eighteenth,\r\nit meant something totally different. To put it a little differently,\r\nall painting that is worth so calling has been done to the glory of God;\r\nand after making due allowance for human frailties of every variety, it\r\nis hard to say that among all the hundreds of great and good painters\r\nthere has ever been one who was not a good man.\r\n\r\nAs for the influence of environment, or nationality, this is so\r\nuniversally recognised that the term \"school\" more often means locality\r\nthan tuition. We talk generally of the French, English, or Dutch\r\nschools, and more particularly of the Paduan, Venetian, or Florentine.\r\nIt is only when we hesitate to call our national treasure a Botticelli\r\nor a Bellini that we add the words \"school of\" to the name of the master\r\nwho is fondly supposed to have inspired its author. The difference\r\nbetween a wood block of the early eighteenth century executed in\r\nEngland and Japan respectively may be cited as an extreme instance of\r\nthe effect of locality on idea, when the method is identical.\r\n\r\nWith reference to the imitation of nature, at the mere mention of which\r\nmodernists become so furious, it is worth recalling that the earliest\r\nstory about painting relates to Zeuxis, who is said to have painted a\r\nbunch of grapes with such skill that the birds ignored the fruit and\r\npecked at the picture. In later times we hear of Rembrandt being the\r\nbutt of his pupils, who, knowing his love of money, used to paint coins\r\non the floor; and there are plenty of stories of people painting flies\r\nand other objects so naturally as to deceive the unwary spectator.\r\nVasari is continually praising his compatriots for painting \"like the\r\nlife.\"\r\n\r\nLastly, the approbation, or if possible the acclamation, of the public\r\nhas seldom if ever been unconsidered by the artist. Where it has, it has\r\nonly been the greatest genius that has been able to exist without it. A\r\nman who has anything to say must have somebody to say it to; and though\r\na painter may seem to be wasting the best part of his life in trying to\r\nmake the people understand what he has to say in his language instead of\r\ntalking to them in their own common tongue, it is rarely that he fails\r\nin the end, even if, alas for him, the understanding comes too late to\r\nbe of any benefit to himself.\r\n\r\nCimabue's last work is said to be a figure, which was left unfinished,\r\nof S. John, in mosaic, for the Duomo at Pisa. This was in 1302, which is\r\nsupposed to be the date of his death, though Vasari puts it two years\r\nearlier, at the time he was engaged with the architect Arnolfo Lapi in\r\nsuperintending the building of the Duomo in Florence, where he is\r\nburied.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nII\r\n\r\nGIOTTO DI BONDONE\r\n\r\n\r\nWhile according all due honour, and probably more, to Cimabue as the\r\noriginator of modern painting, it is to his pupil, GIOTTO, that we are\r\naccustomed to look for the first developments of its possibilities. Had\r\nCimabue's successors been as conservative as his instructors, we might\r\nstill be not very much better off than if he had never lived. For much\r\nas there is to admire in Cimabue's painting, it is only the first flush\r\nof the dawn which it heralded, and though containing the germ of the\r\nfuture development of the art, is yet without any of the glory which in\r\nthe fulness of time was to result from it.\r\n\r\nTo Giotto, Vasari considers, \"is due the gratitude which the masters in\r\npainting owe to Nature, seeing that he alone succeeded in resuscitating\r\nart and restoring her to a path that may be called the true one; and\r\nthat the art of design, of which his contemporaries had little if any\r\nknowledge, was by his means effectually recalled to life.\" This seems to\r\ndetract in some degree from his eulogies of Cimabue; but it is to the\r\nlast sentence that our attention should be directed, which implies that\r\nin profiting by the master's example he succeeded in extending the\r\npossibilities of the new art beyond its first limits. Cimabue, we may\r\nbelieve, drew his Virgins and Saints from living models, whereas his\r\npredecessors had merely repeated formulas laid down for them by long\r\ntradition. Giotto went further, and extended his scope to the world at\r\nlarge. For the plain gold background he substituted the landscape, thus\r\nbreaking down, as it were, a great wall, and seeing beyond it. Nor was\r\nthis innovation merely a technical one--it was the man's nature that\r\neffected it and made his art a living thing.\r\n\r\nGiotto, who was born in 1276, was the son of a simple husbandman, who\r\nlived at Vespignano, about fourteen miles from Florence. Cimabue chanced\r\nupon the boy when he was only about ten years old, tending his father's\r\nsheep, and was astonished to find that he was occupied in making a\r\ndrawing of one of them upon a smooth piece of rock with a sharp stone.\r\nHe was so pleased with this that he asked to be allowed to take him back\r\nto Florence, and the boy proved so apt a pupil that before very long he\r\nwas regularly employed in painting.\r\n\r\nHis influence was not confined to Florence, or even to Tuscany, but the\r\nwhole of Italy was indebted to him for a new impulse in art, and he is\r\nsaid to have followed Pope Clement V. to Avignon and executed many\r\npictures there. Giotto was not only a painter, but his name is also\r\nfamous in the history of architecture: the wonderful Campanile adjoining\r\nthe Duomo in Florence was designed by him, and the foundations laid and\r\nthe building erected under his instructions. On sculpture too he\r\nexercised a considerable influence, as may be seen in the panels and\r\nstatues which adorn the lower part of the tower, suggested if not\r\nactually designed by Giotto, and carved by Andrea Pisano.\r\n\r\nChief of the earlier works of Giotto are his frescoes in the under\r\nchurch at Assisi, and in these may be seen the remarkable fertility of\r\ninvention with which he endowed his successors. Instead of the\r\nconventional Madonna and Child, and groups of saints and angels, we have\r\nhere whole legends represented in a series of pictures of almost\r\ndramatic character. In the four triangular compartments of the groined\r\nvaulting are the three vows of the Franciscan Order, namely, Poverty,\r\nChastity, and Obedience, and in the fourth the glorification of the\r\nsaint. In the first, the Vow of Poverty, it is significant to find that\r\nhe has taken his subject from Dante. Poverty appears as a woman whom\r\nChrist gives in marriage to S. Francis: she stands among thorns; in the\r\nforeground are two youths mocking her, and on either side a group of\r\nangels as witnesses of the holy union. On the left is a youth, attended\r\nby an angel, giving his cloak to a poor man; on the right are the rich\r\nand great, who are invited by an angel to approach, but turn scornfully\r\naway. The other designs appear to be Giotto's own invention. Chastity,\r\nas a young woman, sits in a fortress surrounded by walls, and angels pay\r\nher devotion. On one side are laymen and churchmen led forward by S.\r\nFrancis, and on the other Penance, habited as a hermit, driving away\r\nearthly love and impurity. S. Francis in glory is more conventional, as\r\nmight be expected from the nature of the subject.\r\n\r\nIn the ancient Basilica of S. Peter in Rome Giotto made the celebrated\r\nmosaic of the _Navicella_, which is now in the vestibule of S. Peter's.\r\nIt represents a ship, in which are the disciples, on a stormy sea.\r\nAccording to the early Christian symbolisation the ship denoted the\r\nChurch. In the foreground on the right the Saviour, walking on the\r\nwaves, rescues Peter. Opposite sits a fisherman in tranquil expectation,\r\ntypifying the confident hope of the simple believer. This mosaic has\r\nfrequently been moved, and has undergone so much restoration that only\r\nthe composition can be attributed to Giotto.\r\n\r\nOf the paintings of scriptural history attributed to Giotto very few\r\nremain, and the greater part of those have in recent times been\r\npronounced to be the work of his followers. Foremost, however, among the\r\nundoubted examples are paintings in the Chapel of the Madonna dell'Arena\r\nat Padua, which was erected in 1303. In thirty-eight pictures, extending\r\nin three rows along the wall, is contained the life of the Virgin. The\r\nground of the vaulting is blue studded with gold stars, among which\r\nappear the heads of Christ and the prophets, while above the arch of the\r\nchoir is the Saviour in a glory of angels. Combined with these sacred\r\nscenes and personages are introduced fitting allusions to the moral\r\nstate of man, the lower part of the side walls containing, in medallions\r\npainted in monochrome, allegorical figures of the virtues and vices--the\r\nformer feminine and ideal, the latter masculine and individual--while\r\nthe entrance wall is covered with the wonderful _Last Judgment_.\r\n\r\nHere, as in his allegorical pieces, Giotto appears as a great innovator,\r\na number of situations suggested by the Scriptures being now either\r\nrepresented for the first time or seen in a totally new form. Well-known\r\nsubjects are enriched with numerous subordinate figures, making the\r\npicture more truthful and more intelligible; as in the Flight into\r\nEgypt, where the Holy Family is accompanied by a servant, and three\r\nother figures are introduced to complete the composition. In the Raising\r\nof Lazarus, too, the disciples behind the Saviour on the one side and\r\nthe astonished multitude on the other form two choruses, an arrangement\r\nwhich is followed, but with considerable modification, in Ouwater's\r\nunique picture of the same subject now in the Kaiser Friedrich Museum at\r\nBerlin. This approach to dramatic reality sometimes assumes a character\r\nwhich, as Kugler puts it, oversteps the strict limits of the higher\r\necclesiastical style. It is worth noting, however, that the early\r\nNetherlandish school--as we shall see in a later chapter--developed this\r\ncharacteristic to a far greater extent, continuing the tradition handed\r\ndown, quite independently of Giotto, through illuminated manuscripts,\r\nand with less of that expression of the highest religious or moral\r\nfeeling which is so evident in Giotto.\r\n\r\nThe few existing altar-pieces of Giotto are less important than his\r\nfrescoes, inasmuch as they do not admit of the exhibition of his higher\r\nand most original gifts. Two signed examples are a _Coronation of the\r\nVirgin_ in Santa Croce at Florence, and a _Madonna_, with saints and\r\nangels on the side panels, originally in S. Maria degli Angeli at\r\nBologna, and now in the Brera at Milan. The latter, however, is not now\r\nrecognised as his. The earliest authentic example is the so-called\r\nStefaneschi altar-piece, painted in 1298 for the same patron who\r\ncommissioned the _Navicella_. Giotto's highest merit consists especially\r\nin the number of new subjects which he introduced, in the life-like and\r\nspiritual expression with which he heightened all familiar occurrences\r\nand scenes, and in the choice of the moment of representation. In all\r\nthese no earlier Christian painter can be compared with him. Another and\r\nscarcely less important quality he possessed is in the power of\r\nconveying truth of character. The faces introduced into some of his\r\ncompositions bear an inward guarantee of their lively resemblance to\r\nsome living model, and this characteristic seems to have been eagerly\r\nseized upon by his immediate followers for emulation, as is noticeable\r\nin two of the principal works--in the Bargello at Florence, and in the\r\nchurch of the Incoronata at Naples--formerly attributed to him but now\r\nrelegated to his pupils. The portrait of Dante in a fresco on the wall\r\nof the Bargello shows a deep and penetrating mind, and in the\r\n_Sacraments_ at Naples we find heads copied from life with obvious\r\nfidelity and such a natural conception of particular scenes as brings\r\nthem to the mind of the spectator with extraordinary distinctness.\r\n\r\nOf Giotto's numerous followers in the fourteenth century it is\r\nimpossible in the present work to give any particular account, but of\r\nhis influence at large on the practice as on the treatment and\r\nconception of painting at this stage of its development, one or two\r\nexamples may be cited as typical of the progress he urged, such as the\r\nfrescoes in the Campo Santo at Pisa. This wonderful cloister, which\r\nmeasures four hundred feet in length and over a hundred in\r\nwidth--traditionally the dimensions of Noah's ark--was founded by the\r\nArchbishop Ubaldo, before 1200, on his return from Palestine bringing\r\nfifty-three ships laden with earth from the Holy Land. On this soil it\r\nwas erected, and surrounded by high walls in 1278. The whole of these\r\nwalls were afterwards adorned with paintings, in two tiers.\r\n\r\nSo far as concerns the history of painting, the question of the\r\nauthorship of these frescoes--which are by several distinct hands--is\r\naltogether subordinate to that of the subjects depicted and the manner\r\nin which they are treated, and we shall learn more from a general survey\r\nof them than by following out the fortunes of particular painters. The\r\nearliest are those on the east side, near the chapel, but more important\r\nare those on the north, of about the middle of the fourteenth century,\r\nwhich show a decided advance, both in feeling and execution, beyond\r\nGiotto. The first is _The Triumph of Death_, in which the supernatural\r\nis tempered with representations of what is mortal to an extent that\r\nalready shows that painting was not to be confined to religious uses\r\nalone. All the pleasures and sorrows of life are here represented, on\r\nthe earth; it is only in the sky that we see the demons and angels. On\r\none side is a festive company of ladies and cavaliers, with hawks and\r\ndogs, seated under orange trees, with rich carpets at their feet, all\r\nsplendidly dressed. A troubadour and a singing girl amuse them with\r\nsongs, _amorini_ flutter around them and wave their torches. On the\r\nother side is another group, also a hunting party, on splendidly\r\ncaparisoned horses, and accompanied by a train of attendants. On the\r\nmountains in the background are several hermits, who in contrast to the\r\nvotaries of pleasure have attained in a life of contemplation and\r\nabstinence the highest term of human existence. Many of the figures are\r\ntraditionally supposed to be portraits.\r\n\r\nThe centre foreground is devoted to the less fortunate on earth, the\r\nbeggars and cripples, and also corpses of the mighty; and with these we\r\nmay turn to the allegorical treatment of the subject. To the first group\r\ndescends the angel of death, swinging a scythe, and to her the\r\nunfortunate are stretching out their arms in supplication for an end to\r\ntheir sorrows. The second group, it will be seen, are tracing a path\r\nwhich leads to three open coffins in which lie the bodies of three\r\nprinces in different stages of decay, while a monk on crutches--intended\r\nfor S. Macarius--is pointing to them. The air is filled with angels and\r\ndemons, some of whom receive the souls of the dead.\r\n\r\nA second picture is _The Last Judgment_, and a third _Hell_, the\r\nresemblance between which and the great altar-piece in the Strozzi\r\nChapel in Santa Maria Novella at Florence, painted by Andrea Orcagna in\r\n1357, was formerly considered proof of the same authorship. They are\r\nnow attributed to an unknown disciple of Pietro Lorenzetti, who was\r\npainting in Siena between 1306 and 1348, and is assumed to have been a\r\npupil of Duccio.\r\n\r\nThe fourth picture, apparently by another hand--possibly that of\r\nLorenzetti himself--is _The Life of the Hermits_ in the wilderness of\r\nThebais, composed of a number of single groups in which the calm life of\r\ncontemplation is represented in the most varied manner. In front flows\r\nthe Nile, and a number of hermits are seen on its banks still subjected\r\nto earthly occupations; they catch fish, hew wood, carry burdens to the\r\ncity, etc. Higher up, in the mountains, they are more estranged from the\r\nworld, but the Tempter follows them in various disguises, sometimes\r\nfrightful, sometimes seducing. As a whole this composition is\r\nconstructed in the ancient manner--as in Byzantine art--several series\r\nrising one above the other, each of equal size, and without any\r\npretension to perspective: the single groups, at the same time, are\r\nexecuted with much grace and feeling.\r\n\r\nNext to this are six pictures of the history of S. Ranieri, and as many\r\nof the lives of S. Efeso and S. Potito. The latter are known to have\r\nbeen painted in 1392 by Spinello of Arezzo, or Spinello Aretino as he is\r\ncalled, of whose work we have some fragments in the National\r\nGallery--alas too few! Two of these fragments are from his large fresco\r\n_The Fall of the Rebellious Angels_, painted for the church of S. Maria\r\ndegli Angeli at Arezzo, which after being whitewashed over were rescued\r\non the conversion of the church to secular uses. Vasari relates that\r\nwhen Spinello had finished this work the devil appeared to him in the\r\nnight as horrible and deformed as in the picture, and asked him where he\r\nhad seen him in so frightful a form, and why he had treated him so\r\nignominiously. Spinello awoke from his dream with horror, fell into a\r\nstate of abstraction, and soon afterwards died.\r\n\r\nOn the third part of the south wall is represented the history of Job,\r\nin a series of paintings which were formerly attributed to Giotto\r\nhimself, though it is now recognised that they cannot be of an earlier\r\ndate than about 1370.\r\n\r\nThe _Temptation of Job_ is by Taddeo Gaddi, and the others, painted in\r\n1372, are probably by Francesco da Volterra--not to be confused with the\r\nsixteenth century painter Daniele da Volterra.\r\n\r\nThe paintings on the west wall are of inferior workmanship, while those\r\non the north were the crowning achievement of Benozzo Gozzoli a century\r\nlater.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIII\r\n\r\nTHE EARLIER QUATTROCENTISTS\r\n\r\n\r\nCOMING to the second period in the development of the new art--roughly,\r\nthat is to say, from 1400 to 1450--Vasari observes that even where there\r\nis no great facility displayed, yet the works evince great care and\r\nthought; the manner is more free and graceful, the colouring more varied\r\nand pleasing; more figures are employed in the compositions, and the\r\ndrawing is more correct inasmuch as it is closer to nature. It was\r\nMasaccio, he says, who during this period superseded the manner of\r\nGiotto in regard to the painting of flesh, draperies, buildings, etc.,\r\nand also restored the practice of foreshortening and brought to light\r\nthat modern manner which has been followed by all artists. More natural\r\nattitudes, and more effectual expression of feeling in the gestures and\r\nmovements of the body resulted, as art seeking to approach the truth of\r\nnature by more correct drawing and to exhibit so close a resemblance to\r\nthe face of the living person that each figure might at once be\r\nrecognised. _Thus these masters constantly endeavoured to reproduce what\r\nthey beheld in nature and no more; their works became consequently more\r\ncarefully considered and better understood._ This gave them courage to\r\nlay down rules for perspective and to carry the foreshortenings\r\nprecisely to the point which gives an exact imitation of the relief\r\napparent in nature and the real form. Minute attention to the effects of\r\nlight and shade and to various technical difficulties ensued, and\r\nefforts were made towards a better order of composition. Landscapes also\r\nwere attempted; tracts of country, trees, shrubs, flowers, clouds, the\r\nair, and other natural objects were depicted with some resemblance to\r\nthe realities represented; insomuch that the art might be said not only\r\nto have become ennobled, but to have attained to that flower of youth\r\nfrom which the fruit afterwards to follow might reasonably be looked\r\nfor.\r\n\r\nForemost among the painters of this period was FRA ANGELICO, or to give\r\nhim his proper title, Frate Giovanni da Fiesole, who was born in 1387\r\nnot far from Florence, and died in 1455. When he was twenty years old he\r\njoined the order of the preaching friars, and all his painting is\r\ndevoted to religious subjects. He was a man of the utmost simplicity,\r\nand most holy in every act of his life. He disregarded all worldly\r\nadvantages. Kindly to all, and temperate in all his habits, he used to\r\nsay that he who practised the art of painting had need of quiet, and\r\nshould live without cares and anxious thoughts; adding that he who would\r\ndo the work of Christ should perpetually remain with Christ. He was most\r\nhumble and modest, and in his painting he gave evidence of piety and\r\ndevotion as well as of ability, and the saints that he painted have more\r\nof the air of sanctity than have those of any other master.\r\n\r\nIt was the custom of Fra Angelico to abstain from retouching or\r\nimproving any painting once finished. He altered nothing, but left all\r\nas it was done the first time, believing, as he said, that such was the\r\nwill of God. It is also affirmed that he would never take his brushes in\r\nhand until he had first offered a prayer, and he is said never to have\r\npainted a crucifix without tears streaming from his eyes, and in the\r\ncountenance and attitude of his figures it is easy to perceive proof of\r\nhis sincerity, his goodness, and the depth of his devotion to the\r\nreligion of Christ.\r\n\r\nThis is well seen in the picture of the _Coronation of the Virgin_,\r\nwhich is now in the Louvre (No. 1290). \"Superior to all his other\r\nworks,\" Vasari says of this masterpiece, \"and one in which he surpassed\r\nhimself, is a picture in the Church of San Domenico at Fiesole; in this\r\nwork he proves the high quality of his powers as well as the profound\r\nintelligence he possessed of the art he practised. The subject is the\r\nCoronation of the Virgin by Jesus Christ; the principal figures are\r\nsurrounded by a choir of angels, among whom are a vast number of saints\r\nand holy personages, male and female. These figures are so numerous, so\r\nwell executed in attitudes, so various, and with expressions of the head\r\nso richly diversified, that one feels infinite pleasure and delight in\r\nregarding them. Nay, one is convinced that those blessed spirits can\r\nlook no otherwise in heaven itself, or, to speak under correction, could\r\nnot if they had forms appear otherwise; for all the saints male and\r\nfemale assembled here have not only life and expression most delicately\r\nand truly rendered, but the colouring also of the whole work would seem\r\nto have been given by the hand of a saint or of an angel like\r\nthemselves. It is not without sufficient reason therefore that this\r\nexcellent ecclesiastic is always called Frate Giovanni Angelico. The\r\nstories from the life of Our Lady and of San Domenico which adorn the\r\npredella, moreover, are in the same divine manner; and I for myself can\r\naffirm with truth that I never see this work but it appears something\r\nnew, nor can I ever satisfy myself with the sight of it or have enough\r\nof beholding it.\"\r\n\r\nNo less beautiful are the five compartments of the predella to the\r\naltar-piece still in San Domenico at Fiesole--which were purchased for\r\nthe National Gallery in 1860 at the then alarming price of £3500--with\r\nno less than two hundred and sixty little figures of saintly personages,\r\n\"so beautiful,\" as Vasari says, \"that they appear to be truly beings of\r\nParadise.\"\r\n\r\nFRA FILIPPO LIPPI, born in Florence about 1406, and dying there in 1469,\r\nwas the exact antithesis of Fra Angelico, both in his private life and\r\nin the method of his painting. He was just as earthly in both respects\r\nas Fra Angelico was heavenly. As a child he was put with the Carmelites,\r\nand as he showed an inclination for drawing rather than for study, he\r\nwas allowed every facility for studying the newly painted chapel of the\r\nBranacci, and followed the manner of Masaccio so closely that it was\r\nsaid that the spirit of that master had entered into his body. It is\r\nonly fair to Masaccio to add that this means his artistic spirit, for\r\nFilippo's moral character was by no means exemplary. The story of one of\r\nhis best-known works, _The Nativity_, which is now in the Louvre (No.\r\n1343), is thus related by Vasari:--\"Having received a commission from\r\nthe nuns of Santa Margherita, at Prato, to paint a picture for the high\r\naltar of their church, he chanced one day to see the daughter of\r\nFrancesco Buti, a citizen of Florence, who had been sent to the convent\r\nas a novice. Filippo, after a glance at Lucrezia--for that was her\r\nname--was so taken with her beauty that he prevailed upon the nuns to\r\nallow him to paint her as the Virgin. This resulted in his falling so\r\nviolently in love with her that he induced her to run away with him.\r\nResisting every effort of her father and of the nuns to make her leave\r\nFilippo, she remained with him, and bore him a son who lived to be\r\nalmost as famous a painter as his father. He was called Filippino\r\nLippi.\"\r\n\r\nThe picture of S. John and six saints in the National Gallery (No. 677)\r\nalso recalls the story of his wildness, inasmuch as it came from the\r\nPalazzo Medici, where Filippo worked for the great Cosimo di Medici. It\r\nwas well known that Filippo paid no attention to his work when he was\r\nengaged in the pursuit of his pleasures, and so Cosimo shut him up in\r\nthe palace so that he might not waste his time in running about while\r\nworking for him. But Filippo after a couple of days' confinement made a\r\nrope out of his bed clothes, and let himself down from the window, and\r\nfor several days gave himself up to his own amusements. When Cosimo\r\nfound that he had disappeared, he had search made for him, and at last\r\nFilippo returned; after which Cosimo was afraid to shut him up again in\r\nview of the risk he had run in descending from the window.\r\n\r\nVasari considers that Filippo excelled in his smaller pictures--\"In\r\nthese he surpassed himself, imparting to them a grace and beauty than\r\nwhich nothing finer could be imagined. Examples of this may be seen in\r\nthe predellas of all the works painted by him. He was indeed an\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PLATE I.--FILIPPO LIPPI\r\n\r\nTHE ANNUNCIATION\r\n\r\n_National Gallery, London_]\r\n\r\nartist of such power that in his own time he was surpassed by none;\r\ntherefore it is that he has not only been always praised by\r\nMichelangelo, but in many particulars has been imitated by him.\"\r\n\r\nAs a contributor to the progress of the art of painting he is credited\r\nby Vasari with two innovations, which may be seen in his paintings in\r\nthe church of San Domenico at Prato, namely (1) the figures being larger\r\nthan life, and thereby forming an example to later artists for giving\r\ntrue grandeur to large figures; and (2) certain figures clothed in\r\nvestments but little used at that time, whereby the minds of other\r\nartists were awakened and began to depart from that sameness which\r\nshould rather be called obsolete monotony than antique simplicity.\r\n\r\nIt is noticeable that despite his bad character--which is said to have\r\nbeen the cause of his death by poison--all his work was in religious\r\nsubjects. He was painting the chapel in the Church of Our Lady at\r\nSpoleto when, in 1469, he died.\r\n\r\nPAOLO UCCELLO, as he was called, was born at Florence in 1397, and died\r\nthere in 1475. His real name was Paolo di Dono, but he was so fond of\r\npainting animals and birds--especially the latter--that he officially\r\nsigned himself as Paolo Uccello. He devoted so much of his time,\r\nhowever, to the study of perspective, that both his life and his work\r\nsuffered thereby. His wife used to relate that he would stand the whole\r\nnight through beside his writing table, and when she entreated him to\r\ncome to bed, would only say, \"Oh, what a delightful thing is this\r\nperspective!\" Donatello, the sculptor, is said to have told him that in\r\nhis ceaseless study of perspective he was leaving the substance for the\r\nshadow; but Donatello was not a painter.\r\n\r\nBefore his time the painters had not studied the question of\r\nperspective scientifically. Giotto had made no attempt at it, and\r\nMasaccio only came nearer to realising it by chance. Brunelleschi, the\r\narchitect, laid down its first principles, but it was Uccello who first\r\nput these principles into practice in painting, and thereby paved the\r\nway for his successors to walk firmly upon.\r\n\r\nHow he struggled with the difficulties of this vitally important subject\r\nmay be seen in the large battle-piece at the National Gallery, and\r\nhowever crude and absurd this fine composition may seem at first sight\r\nto those who are only accustomed to looking at modern pictures, it must\r\nbe remembered that Uccello is here struggling, as it were, with a savage\r\nmonster which to succeeding painters has, through his efforts, been a\r\nsubmissive slave.\r\n\r\nThis picture is one of four panels executed for the Bartolini family.\r\nOne of the others is in the Louvre, and a third in the Uffizi.\r\nAnother--or indeed almost the only other--work of Uccello which is now\r\nto be seen is the colossal painting in monochrome (_terra-verde_) on the\r\nwall of the cathedral at Florence. Strangely enough, this equestrian\r\nportrait commemorates an Englishman, Sir John Hawkwood, whose name is\r\nItalianized in the inscription into Giovanni Acuto. He was born at Sible\r\nHedingham in Essex, the son of a tanner, and adventuring under Edward\r\nIII. into France, found his way to Florence, where he served the State\r\nso well that they interred him, on his death in 1393, at the public\r\nexpense, and subsequently commissioned Uccello to execute his monument.\r\n\r\nWith all his devotion to science, the artist has committed the strange\r\nmistake of making the horse stand on two legs on the same side, the\r\nother two being lifted.\r\n\r\nTO MASACCIO, born in or about 1400, and dying in 1443, we owe a great\r\nstep in art towards realism. It was he, says Vasari, who first attained\r\nthe clear perception that _painting is only the close imitation, by\r\ndrawing and colouring simply, of all the forms presented by nature\r\nshowing them as they are produced by her, and that whoever shall most\r\nperfectly effect this may be said to have most nearly approached the\r\nsummit of excellence_. The conviction of this truth, he adds, was the\r\ncause of Masaccio's attaining so much knowledge by means of perpetual\r\nstudy that he may be accounted among the first by whom art was in a\r\nmeasure delivered from rudeness and hardness; it was he who led the way\r\nto the realisation of beautiful attitudes and movements which were never\r\nexhibited by any painter before his day, while he also imparted a life\r\nand force to his figures, with a certain roundness and relief which\r\nrender them truly characteristic and natural. Possessing great\r\ncorrectness of judgment, Masaccio perceived that all figures not\r\nsufficiently foreshortened to appear standing firmly on the plane\r\nwhereon they are placed, but reared up on the points of their feet, must\r\nneeds be deprived of all grace and excellence in the most important\r\nessentials. It is true that Uccello, in his studies of perspective, had\r\nhelped to lessen this difficulty, but Masaccio managed his\r\nforeshortenings with much greater skill (though doubtless with less\r\nscience) and succeeded better than any artist before him. Moreover, he\r\nimparted extreme softness and harmony to his paintings, and was careful\r\nto have the carnations of the heads and other nude parts in accordance\r\nwith the colours of the draperies, which he represented with few and\r\nsimple folds as they are seen in real life.\r\n\r\nMasaccio's principal remaining works are his frescoes in the famous\r\nBranacci Chapel at the Carmine convent in Florence. The work of\r\ndecorating the chapel was begun by Masolino, but finished by Masaccio\r\nand Filippo Lippi. Vasari states it as a fact that all the most\r\ncelebrated sculptors and painters had become excellent and illustrious\r\nby studying Masaccio's work in this chapel, and there is good reason to\r\nbelieve that Michelangelo and Raphael profited by their studies there,\r\nwithout mentioning all the names enumerated by Vasari. Seeing how\r\nimportant the influence of Masaccio was destined to become, I have\r\nventured to italicise Vasari's opinions on the causes which operated in\r\ncreating the Florentine style and in raising the art of painting to\r\nheights undreamt of by its earliest pioneers.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIV\r\n\r\nTHE LATER QUATTROCENTISTS\r\n\r\n\r\nTHREE names stand out conspicuously from the ranks of Florentine\r\npainters in the latter half of the fifteenth century. But progress being\r\none of the essential characteristics of the art at this period, as in\r\nall others, it is not surprising that the order of their fame coincides\r\n(inversely) pretty nearly with that of their date. First, ANTONIO\r\nPOLLAIUOLO; second, SANDRO BOTTICELLI; and lastly, LEONARDO DA VINCI.\r\n\r\nIt is important to note that Pollaiuolo was first apprenticed to a\r\ngoldsmith, and attained such proficiency in that craft that he was\r\nemployed by Lorenzo Ghiberti in the carving of the gates of the\r\nBaptistry, and subsequently set up a workshop for himself. In\r\ncompetition with Finiguerra he \"executed various stories,\" says Vasari,\r\n\"wherein he fully equalled his competitor in careful execution, while he\r\nsurpassed him in beauty of design. The guild of merchants, being\r\nconvinced\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PLATE II.--SANDRO BOTTICELLI (?)\r\n\r\nTHE VIRGIN AND CHILD\r\n\r\n_National Gallery, London_]\r\n\r\nof his ability, resolved to employ him to execute certain stories in\r\nsilver for the altar of San Giovanni, and he performed them so\r\nexcellently that they were acknowledged to be the best of all those\r\npreviously executed by various masters.... In other churches also in\r\nFlorence and Rome, and other parts of Italy, his miraculous enamels are\r\nto be seen.\"\r\n\r\nNow whether or not Antonio, like others, continued to exercise this\r\ncraft, the account given by Vasari, as follows, of his learning to paint\r\nis extremely significant as showing how painting was regarded in\r\nrelation to the kindred arts so widely practised in\r\nFlorence:--\"Eventually, considering that this craft did not secure a\r\nlong life to the work of its masters, Antonio, desiring for his labours\r\na more enduring memory, resolved to devote himself to it no longer; and\r\nhis brother Piero being a painter, he joined himself to him for the\r\npurpose of learning the modes of proceeding in painting. He then found\r\nthis to be an art so different from that of the goldsmith that he wished\r\nhe had never addressed himself to it. But being impelled by shame rather\r\nthan any advantage to be obtained, he acquired a knowledge of the\r\nprocesses used in painting in the course of a few months, and became an\r\nexcellent master.\"\r\n\r\nAs early as 1460 he had painted the three large canvases of _Hercules_\r\nfor Lorenzo de'Medici, now no longer existing, but probably reflected in\r\nthe two small panels of the same subject in the Uffizi. These alone are\r\nenough to mark him as one of the greatest artists of his time. The\r\nmagnificent _David_, at Berlin, soon followed, and the little _Daphne\r\nand Apollo_ in our National Gallery. These were all accomplished\r\nunaided, but a little later he worked in concert with his brother Piero,\r\nto whom we are told to attribute parts of the painting of the large _S.\r\nSebastian_ in the National Gallery, painted in 1475 for Antonio Pucci,\r\nfrom whose descendant it was purchased. \"For the chapel of the Pucci in\r\nthe church of San Sebastian,\" says Vasari, \"Antonio painted the\r\naltar-piece--a remarkable and wonderfully executed work with numerous\r\nhorses, many nude figures, and singularly beautiful foreshortenings.\r\nAlso the portrait of S. Sebastian taken from life, that is to say, from\r\nGino di Ludovico Capponi. This picture has been more extolled than any\r\nby Antonio. He has evidently copied nature to the utmost of his power,\r\nas we see more especially in one of the archers, who, bending towards\r\nthe ground, and resting his bow against his breast, is employing all his\r\nforce to prepare it for action; the veins are swelling, the muscles\r\nstrained, and the man holds his breath as he applies all his strength to\r\nthe effort. All the other figures in the diversity of their attitudes\r\nclearly prove the artist's ability and the labour he has bestowed on the\r\nwork.\"\r\n\r\nIt is in his superb rendering of the figure, especially in the nude,\r\nthat Antonio Pollaiuolo marks a decisive step in the progress of\r\npainting, and is entitled to be regarded as \"the first modern artist to\r\nmaster expression of the human form, its spirit, and its action.\" But\r\nfor him we should miss much of the strength and vigour that\r\ndistinguishes the real from the false Botticelli.\r\n\r\n\"In the same time with the illustrious Lorenzo de Medici, the elder,\"\r\nVasari writes, \"which was truly an age of gold for men of talent, there\r\nflourished a certain Alessandro, called after our custom Sandro, and\r\nfurther named di Botticello, for a reason which we shall presently see.\r\nHis father, Mariano Filipepi, a Florentine citizen, brought him up with\r\ncare; but although the boy readily acquired whatever he had a mind to\r\nlearn,\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PLATE III.--SANDRO BOTTICELLI\r\n\r\nPORTRAIT OF A YOUNG MAN\r\n\r\n_National Gallery, London_]\r\n\r\nyet he was always discontented, nor would he take any pleasure in\r\nreading, writing, or accounts; so that his father turned him over in\r\ndespair to a friend of his called Botticello, who was a goldsmith.\r\n\r\n\"There was at that time a close connection and almost constant\r\nintercourse between the goldsmiths and the painters, wherefore Sandro,\r\nwho had remarkable talent and was strongly disposed to the arts of\r\ndesign, became enamoured of painting and resolved to devote himself\r\nentirely to that vocation. He acknowledged his purpose forthwith to his\r\nfather, who accordingly took him to Fra Filippo. Devoting himself\r\nentirely to the vocation he had chosen, Sandro so closely followed the\r\ndirections and imitated the manner of his master, that Filippo conceived\r\na great love for him, and instructed him so effectually that Sandro\r\nrapidly attained a degree in art that none could have predicted for\r\nhim.\"\r\n\r\nThe influence of the Giottesque tradition which was thus handed on to\r\nthe youthful Botticelli by Filippo Lippi is traceable in the beautiful\r\nlittle _Adoration of the Magi_--the oblong, not the _tondo_--in the\r\nNational Gallery (No. 592). This was formerly attributed to Filippino\r\nLippi, but is now universally recognised as one of Sandro's very\r\nearliest productions, when still under the immediate influence of\r\nFilippo, and prior to the _Fortitude_, painted before 1470, which is now\r\nin the Uffizi, and is the first picture mentioned by Vasari,\r\nthus--\"While still a youth he painted the figure of Fortitude among\r\nthose pictures of the virtues which Antonio and Pietro Pollaiuolo were\r\nexecuting in the Mercatanzia or Tribunal of Commerce in Florence. In\r\nSanto Spirito (Vasari continues, naming a picture which is probably _The\r\nVirgin Enthroned_, now at Berlin (No. 106)), he painted a picture for\r\nthe Bardi family; this work he executed with great diligence, and\r\nfinished it very successfully, depicting the olive and palm trees with\r\nextraordinary care.\"\r\n\r\nThe influence of Pollaiuolo is more evident in his two next productions,\r\nthe two small panels of _Holofernes_ and the _Portrait of a Man with a\r\nMedal_, in the Uffizi, and again in the _S. Sebastian_ now at Berlin,\r\nwhich was painted in 1473.\r\n\r\nAbout 1476 the second _Adoration of the Magi_ in the National Gallery\r\nwas painted, and a year or two later the famous and more splendid\r\npicture of the same subject which is in the Uffizi. With this he\r\nestablished his reputation, showing himself unmistakably as an artist of\r\nprofound feeling and noble character besides being a skilful painter. It\r\nwas commissioned for the church of Santa Maria Novella. \"In the face of\r\nthe oldest of the kings,\" says Vasari, \"there is the most lively\r\nexpression of tenderness as he kisses the foot of the Saviour, and of\r\nsatisfaction at the attainment of the purpose for which he had\r\nundertaken his long journey. This figure is the portrait of Cosimo\r\nde'Medici, the most faithful and animated likeness of all now known of\r\nhim. The second of the kings is the portrait of Giuliano de' Medici,\r\nfather of Pope Clement VII., and he is presenting his gift with an\r\nexpression of the most devout sincerity. The third, who is likewise\r\nkneeling, seems to be offering thanksgiving as well as adoration; this\r\nis the likeness of Giovanni, the son of Cosimo.\r\n\r\n\"The beauty which Sandro has imparted to these heads cannot be\r\nadequately described; all the figures are in different attitudes, some\r\nseen full face, others in profile, some almost entirely turned away,\r\nothers bent down; and to all the artist has given an appropriate\r\nexpression, whether old or young, showing numerous peculiarities, which\r\nprove the mastery he possessed over his art. He has even distinguished\r\nthe followers of each king, so that one can see which belong to one and\r\nwhich to another. It is indeed a most wonderful work; the composition,\r\nthe colouring, and the design are so beautiful that every artist to-day\r\nis amazed at it, and at the time it acquired so great a fame for Sandro\r\nthat Pope Sixtus IV. appointed him superintendent of the painting of the\r\nchapel he had built in Rome.\"\r\n\r\nThe visit to Rome was in 1481, and meantime Botticelli had produced the\r\nwayward _Primavera_, and the more stern and harsh _S. Augustine_ in the\r\nchurch of Ognissanti. Of his frescoes in the Pope's chapel nearly all\r\nhave survived, including _Moses slaying the Egyptian_, _The Temptation_,\r\nand _The Destruction of Korah's Company_, besides such of the heads of\r\nthe Popes as were not painted by Domenico Ghirlandaio and his other\r\nassistants in the work.\r\n\r\nReturning to Florence in 1482, he was for twenty years without a rival\r\nin the city--after the departure of Leonardo to Milan--and he appears to\r\nhave been subjected to no new influences, but steadily to have developed\r\nthe immense forces within him. Before 1492 may be dated the two examples\r\nin the National Gallery, the _Portrait of a Youth_ and the fascinating\r\n_Mars and Venus_, which was probably intended as a decoration for some\r\nlarge piece of furniture. The beautiful and extraordinarily life-like\r\nfrescoes in the Louvre (the only recognised works of the master in that\r\nGallery) from the Villa Lemmi, representing Giovanna Tornabuoni with\r\nVenus and the Graces, and Lorenzo Tornabuoni with the Liberal Arts, are\r\nassigned to 1486. Of this period are also the more familiar _Birth of\r\nVenus_; _The Tondo of the Pomegranate_ and the _Annunciation_ in the\r\nUffizi, and the San Marco altar-piece, the _Coronation of the Virgin_\r\nin the Florence Academy.\r\n\r\nTo the influence of Savonarola, however great or little that may have\r\nbeen, is attributed the seriousness of his latest work. Professor Muther\r\ncharacterises Botticelli as \"the Jeremiah of the Renaissance,\" but\r\nwhether or not this is a rhetorical overstatement, the \"tendency to\r\nimpassioned and feverish action, so evident in the famous _Calumny of\r\nApelles_, reflects, no doubt, the agitation of his spiritual stress.\"[1]\r\n\r\nThis is the latest of Sandro's works which are in public galleries, and\r\nthere is every probability that the last years of his life were not very\r\nproductive. \"This master is said to have had an extraordinary love for\r\nthose whom he knew to be zealous students in art,\" Vasari tells us, \"and\r\nis affirmed to have gained considerable sums of money, but being a bad\r\nmanager and very careless, all came to nothing. Finally, having become\r\nold, unfit for work, and helpless, he was obliged to go on crutches,\r\nbeing unable to stand upright, and so died, after long illness and\r\ndecrepitude, in his seventy-eighth year. He was buried at Florence, in\r\nthe church of Ognissanti in the year 1510.\"\r\n\r\nThe large and beautiful _Assumption of the Virgin_, with the circles of\r\nsaints and angels, in the National Gallery, which has only of late years\r\nbeen taken out of the catalogue of Botticelli's works, is now said to\r\nhave been executed by his early pupil FRANCESCO BOTTICINI (_c._\r\n1446-1497) in 1470 or thereabouts. \"In the church of San Pietro,\" Vasari\r\nwrites of Botticelli, \"he executed a picture for Matteo Palmieri, with a\r\nvery large number of figures. The subject is the Assumption of our Lady,\r\nand the zones or circles of heaven are\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PLATE IV.--SANDRO BOTTICELLI\r\n\r\nTHE NATIVITY\r\n\r\n_National Gallery, London_]\r\n\r\nthere painted in their order. The patriarchs, prophets, apostles,\r\nevangelists, martyrs, confessors, doctors, virgins, and the hierarchies;\r\nall of which was executed by Sandro according to the design furnished to\r\nhim by Matteo, who was a very learned and able man. The whole work was\r\nconducted and finished with the most wonderful skill and care; at the\r\nfoot were the portraits of Matteo and his wife kneeling. But although\r\nthis picture is exceedingly beautiful, and ought to have put envy to\r\nshame, yet there were certain malevolent and censorious persons who, not\r\nbeing able to fix any other blame upon it, declared that Matteo and\r\nSandro had fallen into grievous heresy.\" It is apparent that the picture\r\nhas suffered intentional injury, and it is known that in consequence of\r\nthis supposed heresy the altar which it adorned was interdicted and the\r\npicture covered up.\r\n\r\nIn view of all the circumstances it is certain that it was designed by\r\nBotticelli, and very possibly executed under his immediate supervision\r\nand with some assistance from him. If we do not see the real Botticelli\r\nin it, we see his influence and his power far more clearly than in the\r\nnumerous _tondi_ of Madonna and Child that have been assigned to him in\r\nless critical ages than our own. For the real Botticelli was something\r\nvery real indeed, and though it was easy enough to imitate his\r\nmannerisms, neither the style nor the spirit of his work were ever\r\nwithin reach of his closest followers.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nV\r\n\r\nLEONARDO DA VINCI\r\n\r\n\r\nTwelve years younger than Botticelli was LEONARDO DA VINCI (1452-1520),\r\nwhose career as a painter commenced in the workshop of Andrea\r\nVerrocchio, goldsmith, painter, and sculptor. That so extraordinary a\r\ngenius should have fixed upon painting for his means of expression\r\nrather than any of his other natural gifts is the most telling evidence\r\nof the pre-eminence earned for that art by the efforts of those whose\r\nworks we have been considering. For once we may go all the way with\r\nVasari, and accept his estimate of him as even moderate in comparison\r\nwith those of modern writers. \"The richest gifts,\" he writes, \"are\r\nsometimes showered, as by celestial influence, on human creatures, and\r\nwe see beauty, grace, and talent so united in a single person that\r\nwhatever the man thus favoured may turn to, his every action is so\r\ndivine as to leave all other men far behind him, and to prove that he\r\nhas been specially endowed by the hand of God himself, and has not\r\nobtained his pre-eminence by human teaching. This was seen and\r\nacknowledged by all men in the case of Leonardo da Vinci, in whom, to\r\nsay nothing of the beauty of his person, which was such that it could\r\nnever be sufficiently extolled, there was a grace beyond expression\r\nwhich was manifested without thought or effort in every act and deed,\r\nand who besides had so rare a gift of talent and ability that to\r\nwhatever subject he turned, however difficult, he presently made himself\r\nabsolute master of it. Extraordinary strength was in him joined with\r\nremarkable facility, a mind of regal boldness and magnanimous daring.\r\nHis gifts were such that his fame extended far and wide, and he was held\r\nin the highest estimation not in his own time only, but also and even to\r\na greater extent after his death; and this will continue to be in all\r\nsucceeding ages. Truly wonderful indeed and divinely gifted was\r\nLeonardo.\"\r\n\r\nTo his activities in directions other than painting, I need not allude\r\nexcept to say that they account in a great measure for the scarcity of\r\nthe pictures he has left us, and to emphasise the significance of his\r\nhaving painted at all. To a man of such supreme genius the circumstances\r\nin which he found himself, rather than any particular technical\r\nfacility, determined the course of his career, and in another age and\r\nanother country he might have been a Pheidias or a Newton, a Shakespeare\r\nor a Beethoven.\r\n\r\nBut if the pictures he has left us are few in number--according to the\r\npresent estimate not more than a dozen--they are altogether greater than\r\nanything else in the realm of painting, and with their marvellous beauty\r\nand subtlety have probably had a wider influence, both on painters and\r\non lovers of painting, than those of any other master. They seem to be\r\nendowed with a spirit of something beyond painting itself, and in the\r\npresence of _The Last Supper_ or the _Mona Lisa_ the babble of\r\nconflicting opinions on questions of style, technique, and what not is\r\nsilenced.\r\n\r\nSimilarly, in writing of Leonardo's pictures, every one of which is a\r\nmasterpiece, it seems superfluous to say even a word about what the\r\nwhole world already knows so well. All that can be usefully added is a\r\nlittle of the tradition, where it is sufficiently authenticated,\r\nrelating to the circumstances under which they came into existence, and\r\nsuch of the circumstances of his life as concern their production.\r\n\r\nWhen still quite a youth Leonardo was apprenticed to Andrea Verrocchio,\r\nand the story goes that it was the marvellous painting of the angel, by\r\nthe pupil, in the master's _Baptism_ in the Academy at Florence, that\r\ninduced Verrocchio to abandon painting and devote himself entirely to\r\nsculpture. This angel has been attributed to the hand of Leonardo from\r\nthe earliest times, but can hardly be taken, at any rate in its present\r\ncondition, as a decided proof of the genius that was to be displayed in\r\nmanhood. More certain are the _S. Jerome_ in the Vatican, and the\r\n_Adoration of the Kings_ in the Uffizi, though neither is carried beyond\r\nthe earlier stages of \"under-painting.\" A few finished portraits are now\r\nassigned with tolerable certainty to his earlier years; but for his\r\nfamous masterpieces we must jump to the year 1482, when he left Florence\r\nand went to Milan, where for the next sixteen years he was\r\nintermittently engaged in the execution of the great equestrian statue,\r\nwhich was destroyed by the French mercenaries before it was actually\r\ncompleted.\r\n\r\nIt appears that he was recommended by Lorenzo de'Medici to Lodovico il\r\nMoro, Duke of Milan, probably for the very purpose of executing this\r\nstatue. However that may be, it is now certain that in 1483 he was\r\ncommissioned by the Franciscan monks to paint a picture of the Virgin\r\nand Child for their church of the Conception, and that between 1491 and\r\n1494 Leonardo and his assistant, Ambrogio di Predis, petitioned the Duke\r\nfor an arbitration as to price. This was the famous _Virgin of the\r\nRocks_, now in the Louvre, and the similar, and though not precisely\r\nidentical, composition in our National Gallery is generally supposed to\r\nbe a replica, painted by Ambrogio under the supervision of, and possibly\r\nwith some assistance from, Leonardo himself.\r\n\r\nBetween 1495 and 1498 Leonardo was engaged on the painting of _The Last\r\nSupper_. In the Forster Library at the Victoria and Albert Museum is a\r\nnotebook which contains his first memoranda for the wonderful design of\r\nthis masterpiece. At Windsor are studies for the heads of S. Matthew, S.\r\nPhilip, and\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PLATE V.--LEONARDO DA VINCI\r\n\r\nTHE VIRGIN OF THE ROCKS\r\n\r\n_National Gallery, London_]\r\n\r\nJudas, and for the right arm of S. Peter. That of the head of the Christ\r\nin the Brera at Milan has been so much \"restored\" that it can hardly be\r\nregarded as Leonardo's work. Vasari's account of the delays in the\r\ncompletion of the painting is better known, and probably less\r\ntrustworthy, than one or two notices of about the same date, quoted by\r\nMr H. P. Horne, in translating and commenting on Vasari. In June 1497,\r\nwhen the work had been in progress over two years, Duke Lodovico wrote\r\nto his secretary \"to urge Leonardo, the Florentine, to finish the work\r\nof the Refectory which he has begun, ... and that articles subscribed by\r\nhis hand shall be executed which shall oblige him to finish the work\r\nwithin the time that shall be agreed upon.\" Matteo Bandello, in the\r\nprologue to one of his _Novelle_, describes how he saw him actually at\r\nwork--\"Leonardo, as I have more than once seen and observed him, used\r\noften to go early in the morning and mount the scaffolding (for _The\r\nLast Supper_ is somewhat raised above the ground), and from morning till\r\ndusk never lay the brush out of his hand, but, oblivious of both eating\r\nand drinking, paint without ceasing. After that, he would remain two,\r\nthree, or four days without touching it: yet he always stayed there,\r\nsometimes for one or two hours, and only contemplated, considered, and\r\ncriticised, as he examined with himself the figures he had made.\"\r\n\r\nVasari's story of the Prior's head serving for that of Judas is related\r\nwith less colour, but probably more truth, in the Discourses of G. B.\r\nGiraldi, who says that when Leonardo had finished the painting with the\r\nexception of the head of Judas, the friars complained to the Duke that\r\nhe had left it in this state for more than a year. Leonardo replied that\r\nfor more than a year he had gone every morning and evening into the\r\nBorghetto, where all the worst sort of people lived, yet he could never\r\nfind a head sufficiently evil to serve for the likeness of Judas: but he\r\nadded, \"If perchance I shall not find one, I will put there the head of\r\nthis Father Prior who is now so troublesome to me, which will become him\r\nmightily.\"\r\n\r\nIn 1500 Leonardo was back again in Florence, and his next important work\r\nwas the designing, though probably not the actual painting, of the\r\nbeautiful picture in the Louvre, _The Virgin and Child with S. Anne_,\r\nthe commission for which had been given to Filippino Lippi, but resigned\r\nby him on Leonardo's return. In 1501 Isabella d'Este wrote to know\r\nwhether Leonardo was still in Florence, and what he was doing, as she\r\nwished him to paint a picture for her in the palace at Mantua, and in\r\nthe reply of the Vicar-General of the Carmelites we have a valuable\r\naccount of the artist and his work. \"As far as I can gather,\" he writes,\r\n\"the life of Leonardo is extremely variable and undetermined. Since his\r\narrival here he has only made a sketch in a cartoon. It represents a\r\nChrist as a little child of about a year old, reaching forward out of\r\nhis mother's arms towards a lamb. The mother, half rising from the lap\r\nof S. Anne, catches at the child as though to take it away from the\r\nlamb, the animal of sacrifice signifying the Passion. S. Anne, also\r\nrising a little from her seat, seems to wish to restrain her daughter\r\nfrom separating the child from the lamb; which perhaps is intended to\r\nsignify the Church, that would not wish that the Passion of Christ\r\nshould be hindered. These figures are as large as life, but they are all\r\ncontained in a small cartoon, since all of them sit or are bent; the\r\nfigure of the Virgin is somewhat in front of the other, turned towards\r\nthe left. This sketch is not yet finished. He has not executed any\r\nother work, except that his two assistants paint portraits and he, at\r\ntimes, lends a hand to one or another of them. He gives profound study\r\nto geometry, and grows most impatient of painting.\"\r\n\r\nThe history of this cartoon--as indeed of the Louvre picture--is\r\nsomewhat obscure, but it is certain that the beautiful cartoon of the\r\nsame subject in the possession of the Royal Academy is not the one above\r\ndescribed.\r\n\r\nLastly, there is the famous--or, may we say, now more famous than\r\never--portrait of _Mona Lisa_. \"Whoever wishes to know how far art can\r\nimitate nature,\" Vasari writes, \"may do so in this head, wherein every\r\ndetail that could be depicted by the brush has been faithfully\r\nreproduced. The eyes have the lustrous brightness and watery sheen that\r\nis seen in life, and around them are all those rosy and pearly tints\r\nwhich, like the eyelashes too, can only be rendered by means of the\r\ndeepest subtlety; the eyebrows also are painted with the closest\r\nexactitude, where fuller and where more thinly set, in a manner that\r\ncould not be more natural. The nose, with its beautiful and delicately\r\nroseate nostrils, seems to be alive. The mouth, wonderful in its\r\noutline, shows the lips perfectly uniting the rose tints of their colour\r\nwith that of the face, and the carnation of the cheek appears rather to\r\nbe flesh and blood than only painted. Looking at the pit of the throat\r\none can hardly believe that one cannot see the beating of the pulse, and\r\nin truth it may be said that the whole work is painted in a manner well\r\ncalculated to make the boldest master tremble.\r\n\r\n\"Mona Lisa was exceedingly beautiful, and while Leonardo was painting\r\nher portrait he kept someone constantly near her to sing or play, to\r\njest or otherwise amuse her, so that she might continue cheerful, and\r\nkeep away the melancholy that painters are apt to give to their\r\nportraits. In this picture there is a smile so pleasing that the sight\r\nof it is a thing that appears more divine than human, and it has ever\r\nbeen considered a marvel that it is not actually alive.\"\r\n\r\nIt is worth observing that while these rapturous expressions of wonder\r\nat the life-like qualities of the portrait may seem somewhat tame and\r\nchildish in comparison with the appreciation accorded to Leonardo's work\r\nin these times--notably that of Walter Pater in this case--they are in\r\nreality at the root of all criticism. If Vasari, as I have already\r\npointed out, pitches upon this quality of life-likeness and direct\r\nimitation of nature for his particular admiration, it is only because\r\nthe first and foremost object of the earlier painters was in fact to\r\nrepresent the life; and though in the rarefied atmosphere of modern talk\r\nabout art these naïve criticisms may seem out of date, it is significant\r\nthat between Vasari and ourselves there is little, if any, difference of\r\nopinion as to which masters were the great ones, and which were not.\r\n\"Truly divine\" is a phrase in which he sums up the impressions created\r\nin his mind by the less material qualities of some of the greatest, but\r\nbefore even the greatest could create such an impression they must have\r\nlearnt the rudiments of the art in the school of nature.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nVI\r\n\r\nMICHELANGELO BUONARROTI\r\n\r\n\r\nIN the opening years of the sixteenth century the art of painting had\r\nattained such a pitch of excellence that unless carried onward by a\r\nsupreme genius it could hardly hope to escape from the common lot of\r\nall things in nature, and begin to decline. After Botticelli and\r\nLeonardo, the works of Andrea del Sarto, \"the perfect painter\" as he has\r\nbeen called, fall rather flat; and no less a prodigy than Michelangelo\r\nwas capable of excelling his marvellous predecessors, or than Raphael of\r\nrivalling them.\r\n\r\nVasari prefaces his life to ANDREA DEL SARTO (1486-1531) with something\r\nmore definite than his usual rhetorical flourishes. \"At length we have\r\ncome,\" he says, \"after having written the lives of many artists\r\ndistinguished for colour, for design, or for invention, to that of the\r\ntruly excellent Andrea del Sarto, in whom art and nature combined to\r\nshow all that may be done in painting when design, colouring, and\r\ninvention unite in one and the same person. Had he possessed a somewhat\r\nbolder and more elevated mind, had he been distinguished for higher\r\nqualifications as he was for genius and depth of judgment in the art he\r\npractised, he would beyond all doubt have been without an equal. But\r\nthere was in his nature a certain timidity of mind, a sort of diffidence\r\nand want of strength, which prevented those evidences of ardour and\r\nanimation which are proper to the highest characters from ever appearing\r\nin him which, could they have been added to his natural advantages,\r\nwould have made him truly a divine painter, so that his works are\r\nwanting in that grandeur, richness, and force which are so conspicuous\r\nin those of many other masters.\r\n\r\n\"His figures are well drawn, and entirely free from errors, and perfect\r\nin all their proportions, and for the most part are simple and chaste.\r\nHis airs of heads are natural and graceful in women and children, while\r\nboth in youth and old men they are full of life and animation. His\r\ndraperies are marvellously beautiful. His nudes are admirably executed,\r\nsimple in drawing, exquisite in colouring--nay, they are truly divine.\"\r\n\r\nAnd yet? Well, let us turn to Michelangelo.\r\n\r\n\"While the best and most industrious artists,\" says Vasari, \"were\r\nlabouring by the light of Giotto and his followers to give the world\r\nexamples of such power as the benignity of their stars and the varied\r\ncharacter of their fantasies enabled them to command, and while desirous\r\nof imitating the perfection of Nature by the excellence of Art, they\r\nwere struggling to attain that high comprehension which many call\r\nintelligence, and were universally toiling, but for the most part in\r\nvain, the Ruler of Heaven was pleased to turn the eyes of his clemency\r\ntowards earth, and perceiving the fruitlessness of so many labours, the\r\nardent studies pursued without any result, and the presumptuous\r\nself-sufficiency of men which is farther from truth than is darkness\r\nfrom light, he resolved, by way of delivering us from such great errors,\r\nto send to the world a spirit endowed with universality of power in each\r\nart, and in every profession, one capable of showing by himself alone\r\nwhat is the perfection of art in the sketch, the outline, the shadows,\r\nor the lights; one who could give relief to painting and with an upright\r\njudgment could operate as perfectly in sculpture; nay, who was so highly\r\naccomplished in architecture also, that he was able to render our\r\nhabitations secure and commodious, healthy and cheerful,\r\nwell-proportioned, and enriched with the varied ornaments of art.\"\r\n\r\nA more prosaic passage follows presently, occasioned by the innuendoes\r\nof Condivi as to Vasari's intimacy with Michelangelo and his knowledge\r\nof the facts of his life at first hand. Vasari meets this accusation by\r\nquoting the following document relating to the apprenticeship of\r\nMichelangelo to Domenico Ghirlandaio when fourteen years old. \"1488. I\r\nacknowledge and record this first day of April that I, Lodovico di\r\nBuonarroti, have engaged Michelangelo my son to Domenico and David di\r\nTommaso di Currado for the three years next to come, under the following\r\nconditions: That the said Michelangelo shall remain with the above named\r\nall the said time, to the end that they may teach him to paint and to\r\nexercise their vocation, and that the above named shall have full\r\ncommand over him paying him in the course of these three years\r\ntwenty-four florins as wages....\"\r\n\r\nBesides this teaching in his earliest youth, it is considered probable\r\nthat in 1494, when he visited Bologna, he came under influences which\r\nresulted in the execution at about that time of the unfinished\r\n_Entombment_ and the _Holy Family_, which are two of our greatest\r\ntreasures in the National Gallery. As he took to sculpture, however,\r\nbefore he was out of Ghirlandaio's hands, there are few traces of any\r\nactivity in painting until 1506, when he was engaged on the designs for\r\nthe great battle-piece for the Council Hall at Florence. The one easel\r\npicture of which Vasari makes any mention, the _tondo_ in the Uffizi, is\r\nthe only one besides those already noted which is known to exist. \"The\r\nFlorentine citizen, Angelo Doni,\" Vasari says, \"desired to have some\r\nwork from his hand as he was his friend; wherefore Michelangelo began a\r\ncircular painting of Our Lady for him. She is kneeling, and presents the\r\nDivine Child to Joseph. Here the artist has finely expressed the delight\r\nwith which the Mother regards the beauty of her Son, as is clearly\r\nmanifest in the turn of her head and fixedness of her gaze; equally\r\nevident is her wish that this contentment shall be shared by that pious\r\nold man who receives the babe with infinite tenderness and reverence.\r\nNor was this enough for Michelangelo, since the better to display his\r\nart he has grouped several undraped figures in the background, some\r\nupright, some half recumbent, and others seated. The whole work is\r\nexecuted with so much care and finish that of all his pictures, which\r\nindeed are but few, this is considered the best.\"\r\n\r\nAfter relating the story of the artist's quarrel with his friend over\r\nthe price of this masterpiece (for which he at first only asked sixty\r\nducats), Vasari goes on to describe the now lost cartoons for the great\r\nfresco in the Council Hall at Florence, in substance as follows:--\r\n\r\n\"When Leonardo was painting in the great hall of the Council, Piero\r\nSoderini, who was then Gonfaloniere, moved by the extraordinary ability\r\nwhich he perceived in Michelangelo [he calls him in a letter a young man\r\nwho stands above all his calling in Italy; nay, in all the world],\r\ncaused him to be entrusted with a portion of the work, and our artist\r\nbegan a very large cartoon representing the Battle of Pisa. It\r\nrepresented a vast number of nude figures bathing in the Arno, as men do\r\non hot days, when suddenly the enemy is heard to be attacking the camp.\r\nThe soldiers spring forth in haste to arm themselves. One is an elderly\r\nman, who to shelter himself from the heat has wreathed a garland of ivy\r\nround his head, and, seated on the ground, is labouring to draw on his\r\nhose, hindered by his limbs being wet. Hearing the sound of the drums\r\nand the cries of the soldiers he struggles violently to get on one of\r\nhis stockings; the action of the muscles and distortion of the mouth\r\nevince the zeal of his efforts. Drummers and others hasten to the camp\r\nwith their clothes in their arms, all in the most singular attitudes;\r\nsome standing, others kneeling or stooping; some falling, others\r\nspringing high into the air and exhibiting the most difficult\r\nforeshortenings.... The artists were amazed as they realised that the\r\nmaster had in this cartoon laid open to them the very highest resources\r\nof art; nay, there are some who still declare that they have never seen\r\nanything to equal it, either from his hand or any other, and they do not\r\nbelieve that genius will ever more attain to such perfection. Nor is\r\nthis an exaggeration, for all who have designed from it and copied\r\nit--as it was the habit for both natives and strangers to do--have\r\nbecome excellent in art, amongst whom were Raphael, Andrea del Sarto,\r\nFranciabigio, Pontormo, and Piero del Vaga.\"\r\n\r\nIn 1508 Michelangelo began to prepare the cartoons for the ceiling of\r\nthe Sistine Chapel. Space forbids me to attempt any description of\r\nthese, but the story of their completion as related by Vasari can hardly\r\nbe omitted. \"When half of them were nearly finished,\" he says, \"Pope\r\nJulius, who had gone more than once to see the work--mounting the\r\nladders with the artist's help--insisted on having them opened to public\r\nview without waiting till the last touches were given, and the chapel\r\nwas no sooner open than all Rome hastened thither, the Pope being first,\r\neven before the dust caused by removing the scaffold had subsided. Then\r\nit was that Raphael, who was very prompt in imitation, changed his\r\nmanner, and to give proof of his ability immediately executed the\r\nfrescoes with the Prophets and Sibyls in the church of the Pace.\r\nBramante (the architect) also laboured to convince the Pope that he\r\nwould do well to entrust the second half to Raphael.... But Julius, who\r\njustly valued the ability of Michelangelo, commanded that he should\r\ncontinue the work, judging from what he saw of the first half that he\r\nwould be able to improve the second. Michelangelo accordingly finished\r\nthe whole in twenty months, without help. It is true that he often\r\ncomplained that he was prevented from giving it the finish he would have\r\nliked owing to the Pope's impatience, and his constant inquiries as to\r\nwhen it would be finished, and on one occasion he answered, \"It will be\r\nfinished when I shall have done all that I believe necessary to satisfy\r\nart.\" \"And we command,\" replied Julius, \"that you satisfy our wish to\r\nhave it done quickly,\" adding finally that if it were not at once\r\ncompleted he would have Michelangelo thrown headlong from the\r\nscaffolding. Hearing this, the artist, without taking time to add what\r\nwas wanting, took down the remainder of the scaffolding, to the great\r\nsatisfaction of the whole city, on All Saints' Day, when the Pope went\r\ninto his chapel to sing Mass.\"\r\n\r\nMichelangelo had much wished to retouch some portions of the work _a\r\nsecco_, as had been done by the older masters who had painted the walls;\r\nand to add a little ultramarine to some of the draperies, and gild other\r\nparts, so as to give a richer and more striking effect. The Pope, too,\r\nwould now have liked these additions to be made, but as Michelangelo\r\nthought it would take too long to re-erect the scaffolding, the pictures\r\nremained as they were. The Pope would sometimes say to him, \"Let the\r\nchapel be enriched with gold and bright colours; it looks poor.\" To\r\nwhich Michelangelo would reply, \"Holy Father, the men of those days did\r\nnot adorn themselves with gold; those who are painted here less than\r\nany; for they were none too rich. Besides, they were holy men, and must\r\nhave despised riches and ornaments.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nVII\r\n\r\nRAFFAELLO DI SANTI\r\n\r\n\r\nThe character and the influence of RAPHAEL are well expressed in the\r\nfollowing sentences with which Vasari concludes his biography:--\"O happy\r\nand blessed spirit! every one speaks with interest of thee; celebrates\r\nthy deeds; admires thee in thy works! Well might Painting die when this\r\nnoble artist ceased to live; for when his eyes were closed she remained\r\nin darkness. For us who survive him it remains to imitate the excellent\r\nmethod which he has left for our guidance; and as his great qualities\r\ndeserve, and our duty bids us, to cherish his memory in our hearts, and\r\nkeep it alive in our discourse by speaking of him with the high respect\r\nwhich is his due. For through him we have the art in all its extent\r\ncarried to a perfection which could hardly have been looked for; and in\r\nthis universality let no human being ever hope to surpass him. And,\r\nbeside this benefit which he conferred on Art as her true friend, he\r\nneglected not to show us how every man should conduct himself in all the\r\nrelations of life. Among his rare gifts there is one which especially\r\nexcites my wonder; I mean, that Heaven should have granted him to infuse\r\na spirit among those who lived around him so contrary to that which is\r\nprevalent among professional men. The painters--I do not allude to the\r\nhumble-minded only, but to those of an ambitious turn, and many of this\r\nsort there are--the painters who worked in company with Raphael lived in\r\nperfect harmony, as if all bad feelings were extinguished in his\r\npresence, and every base, unworthy thought had passed from their minds.\r\nThis was because the artists were at once subdued by his obliging\r\nmanners and by his surpassing merit, but more than all by the spell of\r\nhis natural character, which was so full of affectionate kindness, that\r\nnot only men, but even the very brutes, respected him. He always had a\r\ngreat number of artists employed for him, helping them and teaching them\r\nwith the kindness of a father to his children, rather than as a master\r\ndirecting his scholars. For which reason it was observed he never went\r\nto court without being accompanied from his very door by perhaps fifty\r\npainters who took pleasure in thus attending him to do him honour. In\r\nshort, he lived more as a sovereign than as a painter. And thus, O Art\r\nof Painting! thou too, then, could account thyself most happy, since an\r\nartist was thine, who, by his skill and by his moral excellence exalted\r\nthee to the highest heaven!\"\r\n\r\nRaphael was the son of Giovanni Sanzio, or di Santi, of Urbino. He\r\nreceived his first education as an artist from his father, whom,\r\nhowever, he lost in his eleventh year. As early as 1495 probably, he\r\nentered the school of Pietro Perugino, at Perugia, where he remained\r\ntill about his twentieth year.\r\n\r\nThe \"Umbrian School,\" in which Raphael received his first education, and\r\nin which he is accordingly placed, is distinguished from the Florentine,\r\nof which it may be said to have been an offshoot, by several\r\nwell-defined characteristics. Chief of these are, first, the more\r\nsentimental expression of religious feeling, and second, the greater\r\nattention paid to distance as compared with the principal figures; both\r\nof which are explainable on the ground of local circumstances. They\r\nreflect the difference between the bustling intellectual activity of\r\nFlorence and the dreamy existence but broader horizon of the dwellers\r\nin the upper valley of the Tiber. In the beautiful _Nativity_ of PIERO\r\nDELLA FRANCESCA (No. 908 in the National Gallery) we see something akin\r\nto the Florentine pictures, and yet something more besides. Piero shared\r\nwith Paolo Uccello the eager desire to discover the secrets of\r\nperspective; but in addition he seems to have been influenced by the\r\nstudy of nature herself, in the open air, as Uccello never was. His\r\npupil, LUCA SIGNORELLI (1441-1523), was more formal and less\r\nnaturalistic, as may be seen by a comparison between the _Circumcision_\r\n(No. 1128 in the National Gallery) and Piero's _Baptism of Christ_ on\r\nthe opposite wall. PIETRO PERUGINO (1446-1523)--his real name was\r\nVannucci--was influenced both by Signorelli and by Verrocchio. In the\r\nstudio of the latter he had probably worked with Leonardo and Lorenzo di\r\nCredi, so that in estimating the influences which went to form the art\r\nof Raphael we need not insist too strongly on the distinction between\r\n\"Umbrian\" and \"Florentine.\"\r\n\r\nRaphael's first independent works (about 1500) are entirely in\r\nPerugino's style. They bear the general stamp of the Umbrian School, but\r\nin its highest beauty. His youthful efforts are essentially youthful,\r\nand seem to contain the earnest of a high development. Two are in the\r\nBerlin Museum. In the one (No. 141) called the _Madonna Solly_, the\r\nMadonna reads in a book; the Child on her lap holds a goldfinch. The\r\nother (No. 145), with heads of S. Francis and S. Jerome, is better.\r\nSimilar to it, but much more finished and developed, is a small round\r\npicture, the _Madonna Casa Connestabile_, now at St. Petersburg.\r\n\r\nA more important picture of this time is the _Coronation of the\r\nVirgin_, painted for the church of S. Francesco at Perugia in 1503, but\r\nnow in the Vatican. In the upper part, Christ and the Madonna are\r\nthroned on clouds and surrounded by angels with musical instruments;\r\nunderneath, the disciples stand around the empty tomb. In this lower\r\npart of the picture there is a very evident attempt to give the figures\r\nmore life, motion, and enthusiastic expression than was before attempted\r\nin the school.\r\n\r\nAfter this, Raphael appears to have quitted the school of Perugino, and\r\nto have commenced an independent career: he executed at this time some\r\npictures in the neighbouring town of Città di Castello. With all the\r\nfeatures of the Umbrian School, they already show the freer impulse of\r\nhis own mind,--a decided effort to individualize. The most excellent of\r\nthese, and the most interesting example of this first period of\r\nRaphael's development, is the _Marriage of the Virgin_ (Lo Sposalizio),\r\ninscribed with his name and the date 1504, now in the Brera at Milan.\r\nWith much of the stiffness and constraint of the old school, the figures\r\nare noble and dignified; the countenances, of the sweetest style of\r\nbeauty, are expressive of a tender, enthusiastic melancholy, which lends\r\na peculiar charm to this subject.\r\n\r\nIn 1504 Raphael painted the two little pictures in the Louvre, _S.\r\nGeorge_ and _S. Michael_ (Nos. 1501-2) for the Duke of Urbino. _The\r\nKnight Dreaming_, a small picture, now in the National Gallery (No.\r\n213), is supposed to have been painted a year earlier.\r\n\r\nIn the autumn of 1504 Raphael went to Florence. Tuscan art had now\r\nattained its highest perfection, and the most celebrated artists were\r\nthere contending for the palm. From this period begins his\r\nemancipation\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PLATE VI.--PIETRO PERUGINO\r\n\r\nCENTRAL PORTION OF ALTAR-PIECE\r\n\r\n_National Gallery, London_]\r\n\r\nfrom the confined manner of Perugino's school; the youth ripens into\r\nmanhood and acquires the free mastery of form.\r\n\r\nTo this time belong the celebrated _Madonna del Granduca_, now in the\r\nPitti Gallery, and another formerly belonging to the Duke of Terra\r\nNuova, and now at Berlin (No. 247a). In the next year we find him\r\nemployed on several large works in Perugia; these show for the first\r\ntime the influence of Florentine art in the purity, fullness, and\r\nintelligent treatment of form; at the same time many of the motives of\r\nthe Peruginesque school are still apparent. The famous _Cowper Madonna_,\r\nrecently sold to an American for £140,000, also belongs to the year\r\n1505, when the blending of the two influences resulted in a picture\r\nwhich has been extolled by the sanest of critics as \"the loveliest of\r\nRaphael's Virgins.\" An altar-piece, executed for the church of the\r\nServiti at Perugia, inscribed with the date 1506, is the famous _Madonna\r\ndei Ansidei_, purchased for the National Gallery from the Duke of\r\nMarlborough. Besides the dreamy religious feeling of the School of\r\nPerugia, we perceive here the aim at a greater freedom, founded on\r\ndeeper study.\r\n\r\nRaphael was soon back in Florence, where he remained until 1508. The\r\nearly paintings of this period betray, as might be expected, many\r\nreminiscences of the Peruginesque school, both in conception and\r\nexecution; the later ones follow in all essential respects the general\r\nstyle of the Florentines.\r\n\r\nOne of the earliest is the _Virgin in the Meadow_, in the Belvedere\r\nGallery at Vienna. Two others show a close affinity with this\r\ncomposition; one is the _Madonna del Cardellino_, in the Tribune of the\r\nUffizi, in which S. John presents a goldfinch to the infant Christ. The\r\nother is the so-called _Belle Jardinière_, inscribed 1507, in the\r\nLouvre.\r\n\r\nIt is interesting to observe Raphael's progress in the smaller pictures\r\nwhich he painted in Florence--half-figures of the Madonna and Child.\r\nHere again the earliest are characterised by the tenderest feeling,\r\nwhile a freer and more cheerful enjoyment of life is apparent in the\r\nlater ones. The _Madonna della Casa Tempi_, at Munich, is the first of\r\nthis series. In the picture from the Colonna Palace at Rome, now in the\r\nBerlin Museum (No. 248), the same childlike sportiveness, the same\r\nmaternal tenderness, are developed with more harmonious refinement. A\r\nlarger picture, belonging to the middle time of his Florentine period,\r\nis in the Munich Gallery--the _Madonna Canignani_, which presents a\r\npeculiar study of artificial grouping, in a pyramidal shape. Among the\r\nbest pictures of the latter part of this Florentine period are the _S.\r\nCatherine_, now in the National Gallery, formerly in the Aldobrandini\r\nGallery at Rome, and two large altar-pieces. One of these is the\r\n_Madonna del Baldacchino_, in the Pitti Gallery. The other, _The\r\nEntombment_, painted for the church of S. Francesco at Perugia, is now\r\nin the Borghese Gallery at Rome. This is the first of Raphael's\r\ncompositions in which an historical subject is dramatically developed;\r\nbut in this respect the task exceeded his powers. The composition lacks\r\nrepose and unity of effect; the movements are exaggerated and mannered;\r\nbut the figure of the Saviour is extremely beautiful, and may be placed\r\namong the greatest of the master's creations.\r\n\r\nAbout the middle of the year 1508, when only in his twenty-fifth year,\r\nRaphael was invited by Pope\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PLATE VII.--RAPHAEL\r\n\r\nTHE ANSIDEI MADONNA\r\n\r\n_National Gallery, London_]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PLATE VIII.--RAPHAEL\r\n\r\nLA BELLE JARDINIÈRE\r\n\r\n_Louvre, Paris_]\r\n\r\nJulius II. to decorate the state apartments in the Vatican. With these\r\nworks commences the third period of his development, and in these he\r\nreached his highest perfection. The subjects, more important than any in\r\nwhich he had hitherto been occupied, gave full scope to his powers; and\r\nthe proximity of Michelangelo, who at this time began the painting of\r\nthe Sistine Chapel, excited his emulation.\r\n\r\nAt this period, just before the Reformation, the Papal power had reached\r\nits proudest elevation. To glorify this power--to represent Rome as the\r\ncentre of spiritual culture--were the objects of the paintings in the\r\nVatican. They cover the ceilings and walls of three chambers and a large\r\nsaloon, which now bear the name of the \"Stanze of Raphael.\"\r\n\r\nThe execution of these paintings principally occupied Raphael to the\r\ntime of his death, and were only completed by his scholars.\r\n\r\nIn 1513 and 1514 Raphael also executed designs for the ten tapestries\r\nintended to adorn the Sistine Chapel, representing events from the lives\r\nof the apostles. Seven of these magnificent cartoons are now in the\r\nSouth Kensington Museum.\r\n\r\nBeside these important commissions executed for the Papal court, during\r\ntwelve years, many claims were made on him by private persons. Two\r\nfrescoes executed for Roman churches may be mentioned. One, in S. Maria\r\ndella Pace, represents four Sibyls surrounded by angels, which it is\r\ninteresting to compare with the Sibyls of Michelangelo. In each we find\r\nthe peculiar excellence of the two great masters; Michelangelo's figures\r\nare grand, sublime, profound, while the fresco of the Pace exhibits\r\nRaphael's serene and ingenious grace. In a second fresco, the prophet\r\nIsaiah and two angels, in the church of S. Agostino at Rome, the\r\ncomparison is less favourable to Raphael, the effort to rival the\r\npowerful style of Michelangelo being rather too obvious.\r\n\r\nLike all other artists, Raphael is at his best when, undisturbed by\r\noutside influences, he follows the free original impulse of his own\r\nmind. His peculiar element was grace and beauty of form, in so far as\r\nthese are the expression of high moral purity.\r\n\r\nThe following works of his third period are especially deserving of\r\nmention.\r\n\r\nThe _Aldobrandini Madonna_, now in the National Gallery--in which the\r\nMadonna is sitting on a bench, and bends down to the little S. John, her\r\nleft arm round him. The _Madonna of the Duke of Alba_, in the Hermitage\r\nat St. Petersburg. _La Vierge au voile_, in the Louvre; the Madonna is\r\nseated in a kneeling position, lifting the veil from the sleeping Child\r\nin order to show him to the little S. John. The _Madonna della\r\nSeggiola_, in the Pitti at Florence (painted about 1516), a circular\r\npicture. The _Madonna della Tenda_ at Munich; a composition similar to\r\nthe last, except that the Child is represented in more lively action,\r\nand looking upwards.\r\n\r\nA series of similar, but in some instances more copious compositions,\r\nbelong to a still later period; they are in a great measure the work of\r\nhis scholars, painted after his drawings, and only partly worked upon by\r\nRaphael himself. Indeed many pictures of this class should perhaps be\r\nconsidered altogether as the productions of his school, at a time when\r\nthat school was under his direct superintendence, and when it was\r\nenabled to imitate his finer characteristics in a remarkable degree.\r\n\r\nIn this class are the _Madonna dell'Impannata_, in the Pitti, which\r\ntakes its name from the oiled-paper window in the background. The large\r\npicture of a _Holy Family_ in the Louvre, painted in 1518, for Francis\r\nI., is peculiarly excellent. The whole has a character of cheerfulness\r\nand joy: an easy and delicate play of graceful lines, which unite in an\r\nintelligible and harmonious whole. Giulio Romano assisted in the\r\nexecution.\r\n\r\nWith regard to the large altar-pieces of his later period in which\r\nseveral Saints are assembled round the Madonna, it is to be observed\r\nthat Raphael has contrived to place them in reciprocal relation to each\r\nother, and to establish a connection between them; while the earlier\r\nmasters either ranged them next to one another in simple symmetrical\r\nrepose, or disposed them with a view to picturesque effect.\r\n\r\nOf these the _Madonna di Foligno_, in the Vatican, is the earliest. In\r\nthe upper part of the picture is the Madonna with the Child, enthroned\r\non the clouds in a glory, surrounded by angels. Underneath, on one side,\r\nkneels the donor, behind him stands S. Jerome. On the other side is S.\r\nFrancis, kneeling, while he points with one hand out of the picture to\r\nthe people, for whom he entreats the protection of the Mother of Grace;\r\nbehind him is S. John the Baptist, who points to the Madonna, while he\r\nlooks at the spectator as if inviting him to worship her.\r\n\r\nThe second, the _Madonna del Pesce_ has much more repose and grandeur as\r\nwhole, and unites the sublime and abstract character of sacred beings\r\nwith the individuality of nature in the happiest manner. It is now in\r\nMadrid, but was originally painted for S. Domenico at Naples, about\r\n1513. It represents the Madonna and Child on a throne; on one side is\r\nS. Jerome; on the other the guardian angel with the young Tobias who\r\ncarries a fish (whence the name of the picture). The artist has imparted\r\na wonderfully poetic character to the subject. S. Jerome, kneeling on\r\nthe steps of the throne, has been reading from a book to the Virgin and\r\nChild, and appears to have been interrupted by the entrance of Tobias\r\nand the Angel. The infant Christ turns towards them, but at the same\r\ntime lays his hand on the open book, as if to mark the place. The Virgin\r\nturns towards the Angel, who introduces Tobias; while the latter\r\ndropping on his knees, looks up meekly to the Divine Infant. S. Jerome\r\nlooks over the book to the new-comers, as if ready to proceed with his\r\noccupation after the interruption.\r\n\r\nBut the most important is the famous _Madonna di San Sisto_, at Dresden.\r\nHere the Madonna appears as the queen of the heavenly host, in a\r\nbrilliant glory of countless angel-heads, standing on the clouds, with\r\nthe eternal Son in her arms; S. Sixtus and S. Barbara kneel at the\r\nsides. Both of them seem to connect the picture with the real\r\nspectators. This is a rare example of a picture of Raphael's later time,\r\nexecuted entirely by his own hand.\r\n\r\nTwo large altar pictures still claim our attention; they also belong to\r\nRaphael's later period. One is the _Christ Bearing the Cross_, in\r\nMadrid, known by the name of _Lo Spasimo di Sicilia_, from the convent\r\nof Santa Maria dello Spasimo at Palermo, for which it was painted. Here,\r\nas in the tapestries, we again find a finely conceived development of\r\nthe event, and an excellent composition. The other is the\r\n_Transfiguration_, now in the Vatican, formerly in S. Pietro at\r\nMontorio.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PLATE IX.--RAPHAEL\r\n\r\nPORTRAIT OF BALDASSARE CASTIGLIONE\r\n\r\n_Louvre, Paris_]\r\n\r\nThis was the last work of the master (left unfinished at his death); the\r\none which was suspended over his coffin, a trophy of his fame, for\r\npublic homage.\r\n\r\n\"I cannot believe myself in Rome,\" wrote Count Castiglione, on the death\r\nof the master, \"now that my poor Raphael is no longer here.\" Men\r\nregarded his works with religious veneration as if God had revealed\r\nhimself through Raphael as in former days through the prophets. His\r\nremains were publicly laid out on a splendid catafalque, while his last\r\nwork, the _Transfiguration_, was suspended over his head. He was buried\r\nin the Pantheon, under an altar adorned by a statue of the Holy Virgin,\r\na consecration offering from Raphael himself. Doubts having been raised\r\nas to the precise spot, a search was made in the Pantheon in 1833, and\r\nRaphael's bones were found; the situation agreeing exactly with Vasari's\r\ndescription of the place of interment. On the 18th of October, in the\r\nsame year, the relics were reinterred in the same spot with great\r\nsolemnities.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe schools of Lombardy and the Emilia, which derive their\r\ncharacteristics from Florentine rather than from Venetian influences,\r\nmay here be briefly mentioned before turning to the consideration of the\r\nVenetian School. In 1482, it will be remembered, Leonardo went to Milan,\r\nwhere he remained till the end of the century; and the extent of his\r\ninfluence may be judged from many of the productions of BERNADINO LUINI\r\n(1475-1532) and GIOVANNI ANTONIO BAZZI, known as SODOMA (1477-1549). Of\r\nAMBROGIO DI PREDIS we have already heard in connection with the painting\r\nof our version of Leonardo's _Virgin of the Rocks_. GIOVANNI ANTONIO\r\nBOLTRAFFIO (1467-1516) was a pupil of VINCENZO FOPPA, but he soon\r\nabandoned the manner of the old Lombard School, and came under the\r\ninfluence of the great Florentine, of whom he became a most enthusiastic\r\ndisciple.\r\n\r\nMore independent--indeed, he is officially characterised as \"an isolated\r\nphenomenon in Italian Art\"--was ANTONIO ALLEGRI, commonly called\r\nCORREGGIO, from the place of his birth. In 1518 he settled at Parma,\r\nwhere he remained till 1530, so that he is usually catalogued as of the\r\nSchool of Parma, which for an isolated phenomenon serves as well as any\r\nother. Of late years his popularity has been somewhat diminished by the\r\nincreasing demands of private collectors for works which are\r\npurchasable, and most of Correggio's are in public galleries. At Dresden\r\nare some of the most famous, notably the _Nativity_, called \"La Notte,\"\r\nfrom its wonderful scheme of illumination, and two or three large\r\naltar-pieces. The _Venus Mercury and Cupid_ in our National Gallery,\r\nthough sadly injured, is still one of his masterpieces. It was purchased\r\nby Charles I. with the famous collection of the Duke of Mantua. Our\r\n_Ecce Homo_ is entitled to rank with it, as is also the little _Madonna\r\nof the Basket_.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PLATE X.--CORREGGIO\r\n\r\nMERCURY, CUPID, AND VENUS\r\n\r\n_National Gallery, London_]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_VENETIAN SCHOOLS_\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI\r\n\r\nTHE VIVARINI AND BELLINI\r\n\r\n\r\nIn Venice the Byzantine style appears to have offered a more stubborn\r\nresistance to the innovators than in Tuscany, or, in fact, in any other\r\npart of Italy. Few, if any, of the allegorical subjects with which\r\nGiotto and his scholars decorated whole buildings are to be found here,\r\nand the altar pictures retain longer than anywhere else the gilt\r\ncanopied compartments and divisions, and the tranquil positions of\r\nsingle figures. It was not until a century after the death of Cimabue\r\nand Duccio that the real development of the Venetian School was\r\nmanifested, so that when things did begin to move the conditions were\r\nnot the same, and the results accordingly were something substantially\r\ndifferent.\r\n\r\nThe influence of the Byzantine style still hangs heavily over the work\r\nof NICOLO SEMITECOLO, who was working in Venice in the middle of the\r\nfourteenth century, as may be seen in the great altar-piece ascribed to\r\nhim in the Academy--the Coronation of the Virgin with fourteen scenes\r\nfrom the life of Christ. In this work there is little of the general\r\nadvancement visible in other parts of Italy. It corresponds most nearly\r\nwith the work of Duccio of Siena, though without attaining his\r\nexcellence; while the gold hatchings and olive brown tones are still\r\nByzantine.\r\n\r\nAn altar-piece, by MICHELE GIAMBONO, also in the Academy, painted during\r\nthe first half of the fifteenth century, shows a more decided advance,\r\nand even anticipates some of the later excellences of the Venetian\r\nSchool. The drapery is in the long and easy lines which we see in the\r\nTuscan pictures of the period, and what is especially significant, in\r\nview of the subsequent development of Venetian painting, the colouring\r\nis rich, deep, and transparent, and the flesh tints unusually soft and\r\nwarm. This is signed by Giambono, and is one of his most important\r\nworks, as well as the most complete, as it exists in its original state\r\nas an _ancona_ or altar-piece divided into compartments by canopies of\r\njoiners' work. It is unusual in form, inasmuch as the central panel,\r\nthough slightly larger than the pair on either side, contains but a\r\nsingle figure. This figure was generally supposed to be the Saviour, but\r\nit has recently been pointed out that it is S. James the Great, the\r\nothers being SS. John the Evangelist, Philip Benizi, Michael, and Louis\r\nof Toulouse. Some of Giambono's finest work was in mosaic, and the walls\r\nand roof of the Cappella de'Mascoli in S. Mark's may be regarded as the\r\nhighest achievement in mosaic of the early Venetian School. While this\r\nspecies of decoration had given place to fresco painting elsewhere, it\r\nwas here, in 1430, brought to a pitch of perfection by Giambono which\r\nentitles this work to a prominent place in the history of painting.\r\n\r\nBut the two chief pioneers of the early fifteenth century were Giovanni,\r\nor JOHANNES ALAMANUS, and ANTONIO DA MURANO. The former appears from his\r\nsurname to have been of German origin, the latter belonged to the family\r\nof VIVARINI, and they used to work together on the same pictures. Two\r\nexcellent examples of this combination are in the Academy at Venice.\r\nThe one, dated 1440, is a Coronation of the Virgin, with many figures,\r\nincluding several boys, and numerous saints seated. In the heads of the\r\nsaints we may trace the hand of Alamanus, in the Germanic type of\r\ncountenance which recalls the style of Stephen of Cologne. A repetition\r\nof this, if it is not actually the original, is in S. Pantalone at\r\nVenice. The other picture, dated 1446, of enormous dimensions,\r\nrepresents the Virgin enthroned, beneath a canopy sustained by angels,\r\nwith the four Fathers of the Church at her side. The colouring is fully\r\nas flowing and splendid as that of Giambono.\r\n\r\nWe do not recognise here, as Kugler rightly observes, the influence of\r\nthe school of Giotto, but rather the types of the Germanic style\r\ngradually assuming a new character, possibly owing to the social\r\ncondition of Venice itself. There was something perhaps in the nature of\r\na rich commercial aristocracy of the middle ages calculated to encourage\r\nthat species of art which offered the greatest splendour and elegance to\r\nthe eye; and this also, if possible, in a portable form; thus preferring\r\nthe domestic altar or the dedication picture to wall decorations in\r\nchurches. The contemporary Flemish paintings, under similar conditions,\r\nexhibit analogous results. With regard to colour, the depth and\r\ntransparency observable in the works of the old Venetian School had long\r\nbeen a distinguishing feature in the Byzantine paintings on wood, and\r\nmay therefore be traceable to this source without assuming an influence\r\non the part of Padua, or from the north through Giovanni Alamanus.\r\n\r\nThe two side panels of an altar-piece, representing severally SS. Peter\r\nand Jerome, and SS. Francis and Mark, now in the National Gallery (Nos.\r\n768 and 1284), are ascribed to Antonio Vivarini alone, though the centre\r\npanel, the Virgin and Child, now in the Poldi Pezzoli collection at\r\nMilan is said to be the joint work of Alamanus and Antonio. However that\r\nmay be, there is no longer any dispute about the fascinating Adoration\r\nof the Kings in the Kaiser Friedrich Museum at Berlin, formerly supposed\r\nto be the work of Gentile da Fabriano, but now catalogued as that of\r\nAntonio.\r\n\r\nIn 1450 the name of Alamanus disappears altogether, and that of\r\nBARTOLOMMEO VIVARINI, Antonio's younger brother, replaces it in an\r\ninscription upon the great altar-piece commissioned by Pope Nicholas V.\r\nin commemoration of Cardinal Albergati, now in the Pinacoteca of\r\nBologna. The change is noticeable as introducing the Paduan influence of\r\nSquarcione, under whom Bartolommeo had studied, instead of the northern\r\ninfluence of Alamanus, into Antonio's workshop, and while this work of\r\n1450, as might be supposed, bears a general resemblance to that of 1446,\r\nthe change of partnership is at least perceptible, and had a determining\r\ninfluence on the development of the Venetian style.\r\n\r\nA slightly earlier work of Bartolommeo alone is a Madonna and Child\r\nbelonging to Sir Hugh Lane, signed and dated 1448. An altar-piece in the\r\nVenice Academy is dated 1464, a Madonna and Four Saints, in the Frari,\r\n1482, and S. Barbara, in the Academy, 1490. Bartolommeo is supposed to\r\nhave died in 1499.\r\n\r\nALVISE, or LUIGI, VIVARINI was the son of Antonio, and though he worked\r\nunder him and his uncle Bartolommeo, as well as under Giovanni Bellini,\r\nthe Paduan influence is apparent in his work. He was born in 1447, and\r\nhis first dated work is an altar-piece at Montefiorentino, in 1475. In\r\nthe Academy at Venice is a Madonna dated 1480, and at Naples a Madonna\r\nwith SS. Francis and Bernard, 1485. Another Madonna at Vienna is dated\r\n1489, and the large altar-piece in the Basilica at the Kaiser Friedrich\r\nMuseum in Berlin is assigned to about the same time. This is the first\r\nof his works in which the influence of Bellini rather than that of his\r\nfamily is traceable, while of the \"Redentore\" Madonna at Venice, of\r\nabout five years later, Mr Bernhard Bernson says that, \"As a composition\r\nno work of the kind by Giovanni Bellini even rivals it.\" In 1498 he had\r\nadvanced so far as to be spoken of as anticipating Giorgione and Titian,\r\nin the effect of light and in the roundness and softness of the figures\r\nof the _Resurrection_, at Bragora. His last work, the altar-piece at the\r\nFrari, was completed after his death in 1504 by his pupil Basaiti.\r\nBartolommeo Montagna, Jacopo da Valenza and Lorenzo Lotto were the chief\r\nof his other pupils.\r\n\r\nIn connection with the Vivarini must be mentioned CARLO CRIVELLI, who\r\nstudied with Bartolommeo under Antonio and Squarcione. But there was\r\nsomething fierce and uncongenial about Crivelli which takes him out of\r\nthe main body of Venetian painters, and seems to have given him more\r\npride in being made a knight than in his pictorial achievements,\r\nremarkable as they were. In his ornamentation of every detail with gold\r\nand jewels he recalls the style of Antonio Vivarini, but while the\r\nmaster used it as accessory merely, Crivelli positively revelled in it.\r\nAn inventory of the precious stones, ornaments, fruits and flowers, and\r\nother detached items in the great \"Demidoff Altar-Piece\" in the National\r\nGallery would fill several pages. Of the eight examples in this gallery\r\nthe earliest is probably the _Dead Christ_, presumably painted in 1472.\r\nThe Demidoff altar-piece is dated 1476. The _Annunciation_ (No. 739),\r\nwhich may be considered his masterpiece, was ten years later. In 1490\r\nCrivelli was knighted by Prince Ferdinand of Capua, and from that date\r\nonward he was careful to add to his signature the title _Miles_--as\r\nappears in our _Madonna and Child Enthroned_, with SS. Jerome and\r\nSebastian--called the Madonna della Rondine:----\r\n\r\nCAROLUS CRIVELLUS VENETUS MILES PINXIT. This was painted for the Odoni\r\nChapel in S. Francesco at Matelica, the coat of arms of the family being\r\npainted on the step.\r\n\r\nOur _Annunciation_ was executed for the convent of the Santissima\r\nAnnunziata at Ascoli, and is dated 1486. Three coats of arms on the\r\nfront of the step at the bottom of the picture are those of the Bishop\r\nof Ascoli, Pope Innocent VII., the reigning Pontiff, and the City of\r\nAscoli. Between these are the words _Libertas Ecclesiastica_, in\r\nallusion to the charter of self-government given in 1482 by the Pope to\r\nthe citizens of Ascoli. The patron saint of the city, S. Emidius, is\r\nrepresented as a youth kneeling beside the Archangel, holding in his\r\nhands a model of it. The Virgin is seen through the open door of a\r\nhouse, and in an open loggia above are peacocks and other birds. Amid\r\nall the rich detail, the significance of the group of figures at the top\r\nof a flight of steps must not be missed, amongst which a child and a\r\npoet are the only two who are represented as noticing the mystic event.\r\n\r\nAnother painter of the earlier half of the fourteenth century may be\r\nmentioned here, though as he was more famous as a medallist his\r\ninfluence on the main course of painting is not observable. VITTORE\r\nPISANO, called PISANELLO, was born in Verona before 1400, and died in\r\n1455. Of the few pictures attributed to him we are fortunate in having\r\ntwo such beautiful examples as the _SS. Anthony and George_ and _The\r\nVision of S. Eustace_ in the National Gallery. Both exhibit his two most\r\nnoticeable characteristics, namely, the minute care and exquisite\r\nfeeling that made him the most famous of medallists, and his wonderful\r\ndrawing of animals. The latter, it is worth remarking, was attributed by\r\na former owner to Albert Dürer. The other is signed \"Pisanus\"; in the\r\nframe are inserted casts of two of his medals, representing Leonello\r\nd'Este, his patron, and a profile of himself.\r\n\r\nAnother very considerable factor in the development of Venetian painting\r\nwas the influence of GENTILE DA FABRIANO (_c._ 1360-1430), who settled\r\nin Venice in the latter part of his life, and there formed the closest\r\nintimacy with Antonio Vivarini. The remarkable _Adoration of the Kings_\r\nin the Berlin Museum was until lately given to Gentile, though it is now\r\ncatalogued as the work of Antonio. Of Gentile's education little is\r\nknown, and of the numerous works which he executed at Fabriano, in Rome\r\nand in Venice very few have survived. From those that exist, however, we\r\ncan form an estimate of his talents and of the difference between his\r\nearlier and later styles. To the first belong a fresco of the Madonna in\r\nthe Cathedral at Orvieto, and the beautiful picture of the Madonna and\r\nsaints which is now in the Kaiser Friedrich Museum at Berlin. Also the\r\nfine _Adoration of the Kings_, inscribed with his name and the date\r\n1423, formerly in the sacristy of S. Trinità at Florence, and now in the\r\nAccademia. This, his masterpiece, is one of the finest conceptions of\r\nthe subject as well as one of the most excellent productions of the\r\nschools descended from Giotto. Of his later period the _Coronation of\r\nthe Virgin_ (called the _Quadro della Romita_) in the Brera gallery at\r\nMilan is one of the finest. In many respects his work is like that of\r\nFra Angelico, and was aptly characterised by Michelangelo when he said\r\nthat \"Gentile's pictures were like his name.\" Apart from the influence\r\nof the Paduan School, which will next be noticed, the Venetian owed most\r\nto Gentile da Fabriano, if only as the master of Jacopo Bellini, whose\r\nson, Giovanni Bellini, may be regarded as the real head of the Venetian\r\nSchool as developed by his pupils Giorgione and Titian at the opening of\r\nthe sixteenth century.\r\n\r\nWhether or not Giotto left any actual pupils in Padua after completing\r\nthe frescoes in the chapel of the arena there, it must be admitted that\r\nthe older school of painting in Padua, which centred round the church\r\ncontaining the body of S. Anthony, was an offshoot of the Florentine,\r\nand that as Giotto was the great leader in Florence he must be\r\nconsidered the same here; though his followers differ so much from each\r\nother in style that beyond their indebtedness to their founder they have\r\nno distinctive feature in common. But with the opening of the fifteenth\r\ncentury one particular tendency was developed under the fostering\r\ninfluence of FRANCESCO SQUARCIONE, born in 1394, which affected in a\r\nvery sensible degree the style of the great painters of the next\r\ngeneration in Venice. This, in a word, was the cult of the antique.\r\n\r\nAmong the Florentines, as we have seen, the study of form was chiefly\r\npursued on the principle of direct reference to nature, the especial\r\nobject in view being an imitation in two dimensions of the actual\r\nappearances and circumstances of life existing in three. In the Paduan\r\nSchool it now came to be very differently developed, namely, by the\r\nstudy of the masterpieces of antique sculpture, in which the common\r\nforms of nature were already raised to a high ideal of beauty. This\r\nschool has consequently the merit, as Kugler points out, of applying the\r\nrich results of an earlier, long-forgotten excellence in art to modern\r\npractice. Of a real comprehension of the idealising principle of classic\r\nart there does not appear any trace; what the Paduans borrowed from the\r\nantique was limited primarily to mere outward beauty. Accordingly in the\r\nearliest examples we find the drapery treated according to the antique\r\ncostume, and the general arrangement more resembling bas-relief than\r\nrounded groups. The accessories display in like manner a special\r\nattention to antique models, particularly in the architecture, and the\r\nfrequent introduction of festoons of fruit; while the exaggerated\r\nsharpness in the marking of the forms due to the combined influence of\r\nthe study of the antique and the naturalising tendency of the time,\r\nsometimes borders on excess.\r\n\r\nThe immediate cause of this almost sudden outbreak of the cult of the\r\nantique--whatever natural forces were behind it--was the visit of\r\nSquarcione to Greece, and Southern Italy, to collect specimens of the\r\nremains of ancient art. On his return to Padua his collection soon\r\nattracted a great number of pupils anxious to avail themselves of the\r\nadvantages it offered; and by these pupils, who poured in from all parts\r\nof Italy, the manner of the school was afterwards spread throughout a\r\ngreat portion of the country. Squarcione himself is better known as a\r\nteacher than as an artist, the few of his remaining works being of no\r\ngreat importance. There is no example in the National Gallery, but of\r\nthe work of his great pupil, Mantegna, we have as much, at any rate, as\r\nwill serve to commemorate the master.\r\n\r\nANDREA MANTEGNA was born at Vicenza in 1431, and when no more than ten\r\nyears old was inscribed in the guild of Padua as pupil and adopted son\r\nof Squarcione. As early as 1448 he had painted an altar-piece for Santa\r\nSophia, now lost, and in 1452 the fresco in San Antonio. In 1455 he was\r\nengaged with Nicolo Pizzolo (Donatello's assistant), and others, on the\r\nsix frescoes in the Eremitani Church at Padua. The whole of the left\r\nside of the chapel of SS. James and Christopher--the life of S.\r\nJames--and the martyrdom of S. Christopher are his, and in these, his\r\nearliest remaining works, we already see the result of pedantic\r\nantiquarianism combined with his extraordinary individuality.\r\n\r\nIn 1460 he went to Mantua, where he remained for the greater part of his\r\nlife, visiting Florence in 1466 and Rome in 1488.\r\n\r\nAmong his earlier works are the small _Adoration of the Kings_ in the\r\nUffizi at Florence, the _Death of the Virgin_ and the _S. George_ in the\r\nVenice Academy. From 1484 to 1494 he was intermittently engaged on the\r\nnine great cartoons of _The Triumph of Cæsar_, which are now at Hampton\r\nCourt, having been acquired by Charles I. with many other gems from the\r\nDuke of Mantua's collection. On the completion of these he painted the\r\ncelebrated _Madonna della Vittoria_, now in the Louvre--a large\r\naltar-piece representing a Madonna surrounded by saints, with Francesco\r\nGonzaga, Duke of Mantua, and his wife, kneeling at her feet. It is a\r\ndedication picture for a victory obtained over Charles VIII. of France\r\nin 1495. It is no less remarkable for its superb execution than for a\r\nsofter treatment of the flesh than is usual in Mantegna's work. Two\r\nother pictures in the Louvre are, however, distinguished by similar\r\nqualities--the _Parnassus_, painted in 1497, and the _Triumph of\r\nVirtue_.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PLATE XI.--ANDREA MANTEGNA\r\n\r\nTHE MADONNA DELLA VITTORIA\r\n\r\n_Louvre, Paris_]\r\n\r\nIn our own collection we have _The Agony in the Garden_, painted in\r\n1459--to which I shall refer presently--two monochrome paintings (Nos.\r\n1125 and 1145), the beautiful _Virgin and Child Enthroned_, with SS.\r\nMary Magdalen and John the Baptist, which is comparable with the more\r\nfamous Louvre _Madonna_, and, lastly, the _Triumph of Scipio_, in\r\nmonochrome, painted for Francesco Cornaro, a Venetian nobleman,\r\ncompleted in 1506, only a few months before the painter's death. In this\r\nwe see that Mantegna's antiquarianism was not simply a youthful phase,\r\nbut lasted till the very end of his career. The subject is the reception\r\nof the Phrygian mother of the gods among the recognised divinities of\r\nthe Roman State, as is indicated on the plinth by the inscription. In\r\nthe centre is Claudia Quinta about to kneel before the bust of the\r\ngoddess. Behind is Scipio, and in the background are monuments to his\r\nfamily. The composition includes twenty-two figures. It is significant\r\nthat the subject and its treatment are so entirely classic as only to be\r\nappreciated by references to Latin literature.\r\n\r\nAnother significance attaches to the _Agony in the Garden_ above\r\nmentioned, which is one of the very earliest, as the _Scipio_ is the\r\nvery latest, of Mantegna's pictures, being painted before he left Padua\r\nto go to Mantua. In this we find that the original suggestion for the\r\ndesign appears to have been taken from a drawing in the sketch-book of\r\nhis father-in-law, Jacopo Bellini, which is now in the British Museum;\r\nand the same design appears to have served Giovanni Bellini in the\r\ncomposition of the picture in our gallery (No. 726). This takes us back\r\nto Venice, and accounts for the Paduan influence traceable in the works\r\nof the Bellini family and their pupils.\r\n\r\nJACOPO BELLINI, whose considerable talents have been somewhat obscured\r\nby the fame of his two sons, Gentile and Giovanni, was originally a\r\npupil of Gentile da Fabriano, after whom he named his eldest son. He was\r\nworking in Padua in the middle of the fifteenth century, in rivalry with\r\nSquarcione, and in 1453 his daughter Nicolosia married Andrea Mantegna.\r\nThus it happened that both of his sons came under the influence of\r\nMantegna, and evidently, too, of the sculptor Donatello, when working at\r\nPadua between 1450 and 1460.\r\n\r\nVery few authentic pictures by Jacopo are known to us. _A Crucifixion_\r\n(much repainted) was in the sacristy of the Episcopal Palace at Verona;\r\nand another, which recalls the treatment of his master, Gentile da\r\nFabriano, at Lovere, near Bergamo. In the sketch-book above mentioned,\r\nthe contents of which consist of sacred subjects, and studies from the\r\nantique, both in architecture and in costume, we see the peculiar\r\ntendency of the Paduan School expressed in the most complete and\r\ncomprehensive manner. These drawings constitute the most remarkable link\r\nof connection between Mantegna and the sons of Jacopo Bellini, all three\r\nof whom must have studied from them. The book was inherited by Gentile\r\non his mother's death, and bequeathed by him to his brother on condition\r\nthat he should finish the picture of _S. Mark_, on which Gentile was\r\nengaged at the time of his death.\r\n\r\nGIOVANNI BELLINI was born in 1428 or 1430 and lived to 1516. Albert\r\nDürer, writing from Venice in 1506, says that \"he is very old, but is\r\nstill the best in painting.\"\r\n\r\nThe greater number of Bellini's pictures are to be found in the\r\ngalleries and churches in Venice, all of those which are dated being\r\nthe work of his old age. Of his earlier pictures we are fortunate in\r\nhaving two fine examples in the National Gallery, _Christ's Agony in the\r\nGarden_ (No. 726) and _The Blood of the Redeemer_ (No. 1233). In both of\r\nthese the influence of his famous brother-in-law Andrea Mantegna, is\r\ntraceable,--the former being till lately attributed to him. Both\r\nGiovanni and Gentile worked in Padua, where Mantegna was established, in\r\n1460 or thereabouts, and where another influence, that of the sculptor\r\nDonatello, must have had its effect on the young brothers. Similar in\r\ncharacter, and even more beautiful in some respects, is the _Redeemer_,\r\na single half figure in a landscape, recently acquired for the\r\nLouvre--the first authentic example of the master in that collection.\r\n\r\nIn 1464, Giovanni had returned to Venice, and it was some years before\r\nthe severe Paduan influence melted before \"the sensuous feeling of the\r\ntrue Venetian temperament.\" In 1475, however, the arrival of Antonello\r\nda Messina in Venice, bringing with him the practice of painting in oil,\r\neffected a revolution, in which Giovanni, if not one of the foremost,\r\nwas certainly one of the most successful in adopting the new method. His\r\nlater works, so far from showing any diminution of power, may be said to\r\nanticipate the Venetian style of the sixteenth century in the clearest\r\nmanner. One of the chief, dated 1488, is the large altar-piece in the\r\nsacristy of S. Maria di Frari, a _Madonna Enthroned_ with two angels and\r\nfour saints. The two little angels are of the utmost beauty; the one is\r\nplaying on a lute, and listens with head inclined to hear whether the\r\ninstrument is in tune; the other is blowing a pipe. The whole is\r\nperfectly finished and of a splendid effect of colour. To the year 1486\r\nbelongs a _Madonna Enthroned with Six Saints_, now in the Academy at\r\nVenice. The famous head of the Doge Loredano in the National Gallery\r\nmust have been painted in or after 1501. In 1507, he completed the large\r\npicture of _S. Mark Preaching at Alexandria_, now in the Brera Gallery\r\nat Milan, begun by his brother Gentile. Within three years of his death,\r\nnamely in 1513, he could produce such a masterwork as the altar-piece in\r\nS. Giovanni Crisostomo. His last work, the landscape in which was\r\nfinished by Titian, is dated 1514. This is the famous _Bacchanal_ now in\r\nthe collection of the Duke of Northumberland.\r\n\r\nThe influence of Bellini on the Venetian School was paramount, and his\r\nnoble example helped more than anything else to develop the excellences\r\nobservable in the works of Cimada Conegliano, Vincenzo Catena, Lorenzo\r\nLotto, Palma Vecchio and Basaiti, to say nothing of his great pupils\r\nTitian and Giorgione. It is impossible to conjecture what course the\r\ngenius of this younger generation would have taken without his guidance,\r\nbut when we consider that in 1500 Bellini was seventy years old, and had\r\nstored within his mind the experience of his early association with his\r\nbrother-in-law Andrea Mantegna in Padua, the introduction of the use of\r\noil paints by Antonello da Messina in 1475, since which date he had\r\nsedulously developed the new practice; when we also take into account\r\nthe dignity and gravity of his own works, and the indication they afford\r\nof the man himself, it is not difficult to judge how much his pupils and\r\nsuccessors owed to him.\r\n\r\nThe works of GENTILE BELLINI, the elder brother of Giovanni, are of less\r\nimportance, but of considerable interest, especially in view of his\r\njourney to Constantinople in 1479 at the request of the Sultan, whose\r\nportrait he painted there in the following year. A replica\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PLATE XII.--GIOVANNI BELLINI\r\n\r\nTHE DOGE LOREDANO\r\n\r\n_National Gallery, London_]\r\n\r\nof this portrait has been bequeathed to the National Gallery by Sir\r\nHenry Layard, and it is to be hoped that the difficulties raised by the\r\nItalian government as to its removal from Venice will shortly be\r\novercome. The picture of _S. Mark Preaching at Alexandria_ already\r\nmentioned as having been finished by Giovanni, is remarkable for the\r\nOriental costumes of all the figures in it. Gentile's pictures are often\r\nascribed to his brother; in two examples at the National Gallery (Nos.\r\n808 and 1440) there is actually a false signature on a cartellino. In\r\nthe latter instance Messrs Ludwig and Molmenti are still of opinion that\r\nthe picture is the work of Giovanni.\r\n\r\nVINCENZO CATENA (_c._ 1470-1530) is not known to have been a pupil of\r\nBellini, but he began by so modelling his style upon him that one of his\r\nworks in the National Gallery was until quite lately officially ascribed\r\nto him, namely the _S. Jerome in his Study_. Another, a later work, _A\r\nWarrior Adoring the Infant Christ_ was similarly ascribed to Giorgione.\r\nThis is a proof that Catena was very susceptible to various influences,\r\nand was \"an artist of extraordinary suppleness of mind, never too old to\r\nlearn or to appreciate new ideals and new sentiments.\" In a manner more\r\nhis own is the _Madonna with Four Saints_ in the Berlin Gallery (No.\r\n19). The _S. Jerome_ and the _Warrior_ are among the most popular\r\npictures in the National Gallery--partly perhaps on account of their\r\nsupposed illustrious parentage, but by no means entirely. A painter who\r\ncould so absorb the characteristics of two such masters must needs be a\r\nmaster himself.\r\n\r\nCIMA DA CONEGLIANO, so called from his birthplace in Friuli--the rocky\r\nheight of which serves as a background in some of his pictures--settled\r\nin Venice in 1490, when he was about thirty years old. The influence of\r\nBellini may be seen in the temperamental as well as the technical\r\nqualities of his work, which is distinguished by sound drawing and\r\nproportion, fine and brilliant colour, as well as by sympathetic types\r\nof countenance. One of his best and earliest pictures is the _S. John\r\nthe Baptist_ with four other saints, in Santa Maria del Orto in Venice.\r\nAnother is the _Madonna with S. Jerome and S. Louis_, now in the Vienna\r\nGallery. A smaller but peculiarly attractive piece is the _S. Anianus of\r\nAlexandria_ healing a shoemaker's wounded hand, at Berlin, distinguished\r\nfor its beautiful clear colours and the life-like character of the\r\nheads.\r\n\r\nANDREA PREVITALI, born in Bergamo in 1480, came to Venice to study under\r\nBellini, whom he succeeded in imitating with remarkable success. _The\r\nMystic Marriage of S. Catherine_ (No. 1409) in the National Gallery was\r\nformerly attributed to Bellini. If he had not the originality to carry\r\nthe art any farther, his pictures are nevertheless a decided and very\r\nagreeable proof of the advance that was being made in it at the\r\nbeginning of the sixteenth century, before the full splendour of\r\nGiorgione and Titian had unfolded.\r\n\r\nMARCO BASAITI, though probably not a pupil of Bellini, nevertheless\r\nacquired many of his characteristics. The picture in the National\r\nGallery known as _The Madonna of the Meadow_ was until lately assigned\r\nto Bellini, and another of his, in the Giovanelli Palace at Venice,\r\nwhich is identical in technique, tone, and general effect with this one,\r\nis still so ascribed. Whether or not he learnt from Bellini, he was\r\ncertainly an assistant to Alvise Vivarini, on whose death he completed\r\nthe large altar-piece in the Church of S. Maria de Friari at Venice,\r\nrepresenting _S. Ambrose surrounded by Saints_. His _Christ on the Mount\r\nof Olives_ and _The Calling of Zebedee_, both dated 1510, are now in the\r\nAcademy at Venice, and together with the _Portrait of a Man_, dated\r\n1521, in the Bergamo Gallery, and _The Assumption_ in S. Pietro Martire\r\nat Murano, may be considered his best performances.\r\n\r\nMore remote from Bellini, yet not so far as to be entirely free from his\r\ninfluence in some of their more important compositions, was the school\r\nformed by LAZZARO DI BASTIANI or SEBASTIANI, of which the chief ornament\r\nwas Vittore Carpaccio, and among the lesser ones Giovanni Mansueti and\r\nBenedetto Diana. The history of this independent group of painters has\r\nonly of late years been elucidated; Kugler, after a page devoted to\r\nCarpaccio, dismissed them with the remark that Mansueti and Bastiani\r\nwere both pupils of Carpaccio, and that Benedetto Diana was \"less\r\ndistinguished.\" Our national collection was without any example until\r\n1896, when Mansueti's _Symbolic representation of the Crucifixion_ was\r\npurchased. In 1905 the National Art-Collections Fund secured Bastiani's\r\n_Virgin and Child_, and in 1910 Sir Claude Phillips presented Diana's\r\n_Christ Blessing_. Alas! that we are still without anything from the\r\nhand of Vittore Carpaccio. Seven portraits by Moroni do not fill a gap\r\nlike this.\r\n\r\nThe name of Lazzaro de Bastiani first occurs in Venice as a witness to\r\nhis brother's will in 1449, and as early as 1460 he was painting an\r\naltar-piece for the Church of San Samuele. Ten years later, the brothers\r\nof the Scuolo di San Marco ordered a picture of the _Story of David_\r\nfrom him, promising him the same payment as they gave to Jacobo Bellini,\r\nwho had been working for them with his two sons Gentile and Giovanni.\r\nIn 1474, another proof of his rank and repute as a painter is afforded\r\nby a letter from a gentleman in Constantinople, asking for a picture by\r\nhim, but that Giovanni Bellini should paint it in the event of Bastiani\r\nbeing already dead. He was thus, it would seem, preferred to Bellini,\r\nthough it will be remembered that five years later, when the Sultan\r\nexpressed the wish that a distinguished portrait-painter should be sent\r\nhim from Venice, it was Gentile Bellini who was nominated. All the same,\r\nGentile was a portrait-painter, and Bastiani was not; and it is fairly\r\nevident that the latter was at least in the front rank. One of his\r\nbest-known pictures the _Vergine dai begli occhi_ in the Ducal Palace at\r\nVenice used to be attributed to Giovanni Bellini; but though he appears\r\nto have drawn inspiration for his larger and more important compositions\r\nfrom Jacobo Bellini, his style was chiefly developed through that of\r\nGiambono. His most important work is now in the Academy at Vienna--an\r\naltar-piece painted for the Church of Corpus Domini, Venice, _S.\r\nVeneranda Enthroned_. In the Imperial Gallery at Vienna are a _Last\r\nCommunion_ and _Funeral of S. Girolamo_. In the Academy at Venice are\r\n_S. Anthony of Padua_, seated between the branches of a walnut-tree,\r\nwith Cardinal Bonaventura and Brother Leo on either side, a large\r\npicture of a _Miracle of the Holy Cross_, and a remarkable rendering of\r\n_The Madonna Kneeling_, the child being laid under an elaborate canopy.\r\nAn _Entombment_ in the Church of S. Antonino at Venice is reminiscent of\r\nGiovanni Bellini at his best.\r\n\r\nIn 1508, the name of VITTORE CARPACCIO occurs with that of Bastiani in\r\nconnection with the frescoes of Giorgione upon the façade of the Fondaco\r\nde Tedeschi, about which there was a dispute. To Carpaccio we are\r\nindebted for the most vivid realization of the contemporary life of\r\nVenice; for although his subjects were nominally taken from sacred\r\nhistory or legend, they are treated in a thoroughly secular fashion,\r\ngiving the clearest idea of the buildings, people, and costume of the\r\nVenice of his time, with the greatest variety and richest development.\r\nHis object is not only to represent single events, but a complete scene,\r\nand while we observe this characteristic in one or two pictures by the\r\nBellini, Carpaccio not only shows it much oftener, but carries it to a\r\nmuch fuller development--possibly influenced by the Netherlandish\r\nmasters.\r\n\r\nMany of his works are in the Academy at Venice; eight large pictures,\r\npainted between 1490 and 1495, represent the history of S. Ursula and\r\nthe eleven thousand virgins. Such a wealth of charming material might\r\nhave embarrassed a less capable painter, but \"the monotonous incident\r\nwhich forms the groundwork of many of them,\" as Kugler coldly puts it,\r\n\"is throughout varied and elevated by a free style of grouping and by\r\nhappy moral allusions.\" Another series is that of the _Miracles of the\r\nHoly Cross_, among which may be especially noticed the cure of a man\r\npossessed by a devil; the scene is laid in the loggia of a Venetian\r\npalace, and is watched from below by a varied group of figures on the\r\nCanal and its banks. Larger and broader treatment may be seen in the\r\n_Presentation in the Temple_, painted in 1510, which is also in the\r\nAcademy, and in the altar-piece of _S. Vitale_, dated 1514. This last\r\nbrings Carpaccio into closer comparison with the later Venetian\r\npainters, being in the nature of a _Santa Conversazione_, where the holy\r\npersonages are grouped in some definite relation to each other, and not\r\nindependent figures.\r\n\r\nPALMA VECCHIO (1480-1528), so called to distinguish him from Giacomo\r\nPalma the younger--Palma Giovane,--was so much influenced by Giorgione\r\nand Titian that his indebtedness to Bellini appears to have been\r\ncomparatively slight. The beautiful _Portrait of a Poet_ in the National\r\nGallery has been attributed both to Giorgione and to Titian.\r\n\r\nThe number of pictures which are now permitted by the experts to be\r\ncalled Giorgione's is so small, that we may learn more about him as an\r\ninfluence on the work of other painters--especially Titian--than from\r\nthe meagre materials available for his own biography. The only\r\nunquestioned examples of his work are three pictures at the Uffizi, _The\r\nTrial of Moses_, _The Judgment of Solomon_, and _The Knight of Malta_;\r\nthe _Venus_ at Dresden; _The Three Philosophers_ at Vienna; and the\r\nfamous _Concert Champêtre_ in the Louvre. But until the critics deprive\r\nhim even of these, we are able to agree that \"his capital achievement\r\nwas the invention of the modern spirit of lyrical passion and romance in\r\npictorial art, and his magical charm has never been equalled.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nII\r\n\r\nTIZIANO VECELLIO\r\n\r\n\r\nTITIAN occupies almost, if not quite, as important a place in the\r\nhistory of painting as does Shakespeare in that of literature. His fame,\r\nhis popularity, the wide range as well as the immense quantity of his\r\nworks, entitle him to be ranked with our poet, if only for the\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PLATE XIII.--GIORGIONE\r\n\r\nVENETIAN PASTORAL\r\n\r\n_Louvre, Paris_]\r\n\r\nenormous influence they have both exercised on posterity: and without\r\ncarrying the parallel farther than the limits imposed by the difference\r\nof their circumstances and their method of expression, it may fairly be\r\nsaid that Titian, in painting, stands for us to-day much as Shakespeare\r\nstands for in letters. \"Titian,\" says M. Caro Delvaille,[2] \"is the\r\nfather of modern painting. As the blood of the patriarchs of old infused\r\nthe veins of a whole race, so the genius of the most productive of\r\npainters was destined to infuse those of artists through all the ages\r\neven to the present day. He bequeathed, in his enormous _oeuvre_, a\r\nheritage in which generations of painters have participated.\"\r\n\r\nNot only was he the father of modern painting, but he was himself the\r\nfirst modern painter, just as Shakespeare was, to all present intents\r\nand purposes, the first modern writer. Among a thousand readers of\r\nShakespeare, there is possibly not more than one who has ever read a\r\nline of Chaucer, or who has ever heard of any of his other predecessors.\r\nSo it is with Titian. To the connoisseur, Titian is one of the latest\r\npainters; to the public he is the earliest. \"In certain of his\r\nportraits,\" we read in the National Gallery Catalogue, \"he ranks with\r\nthe supreme masters; in certain other aspects he is seen as the greatest\r\nacademician, as perhaps he was the first.\"\r\n\r\nAs it happens, too, Titian stands in much the same relation to Giorgione\r\nas Shakespeare did to Marlowe. Giorgione was really the great innovator,\r\nand Giorgione died young, leaving Titian to carry on the work. It has\r\nalways been supposed that Titian and Giorgione, like Marlowe and\r\nShakespeare, were born within the same year; but in this respect the\r\nparallel is no longer admissible, as Mr Herbert Cook has shown to the\r\nverge of actual proof that the story of Titian being born in 1577, and\r\nhaving lived to be ninety-nine years old, is unworthy of acceptance. If\r\nthis were merely a question of biography, it would not be worth dwelling\r\nupon; but as it seriously affects the whole study of early Venetian\r\npainting, it is necessary to point out that the probability, according\r\nto a critical study of all the evidence available, is that Titian was\r\nnot born till 1488 or 1489, and was thus really the pupil rather than\r\nthe contemporary of Giorgione, and therefore more slightly influenced by\r\nGiovanni Bellini than has been generally supposed.\r\n\r\nWithout going into all the evidence adduced by Mr Cook (_Reviews and\r\nAppreciations,_ Heinemann, 1913) it is nevertheless pretty evident that\r\nin the account given by his friend and contemporary, Lodovico Dolce,\r\npublished in 1557, we have the most authentic story of Titian's early\r\nyears, and from this it is quite clear that Titian was considerably\r\nyounger than Giorgione. \"Being born at Cadore,\" he writes, \"of\r\nhonourable parents, he was sent, when a child of nine years old, by his\r\nfather to Venice, to the house of his father's brother, in order that he\r\nmight be put under some proper master to study painting; his father\r\nhaving perceived in him even at that tender age strong marks of genius\r\ntowards the art.... His uncle directly carried the child to the house of\r\nSebastanio, father of the _gentilissimo_ Valerio and of Francesco\r\nZuccati (distinguished masters of the art of mosaic, ...) to learn the\r\nprinciples of the art. From them he was removed to Gentile Bellini,\r\nbrother of Giovanni, but much inferior to him, who at that time was at\r\nwork with his brother in the Grand Council Chamber. But Titian, impelled\r\nby nature to greater excellence and perfection in his art, could not\r\nendure following the dry and laboured manner of Gentile, but designed\r\nwith boldness and expedition. Whereupon Gentile told him he would make\r\nno progress in painting because he diverged so much from the old style.\r\nThereupon Titian left the stupid Gentile and found means to attach\r\nhimself to Giovanni Bellini; but not perfectly pleased with his manner,\r\nhe chose Giorgio da Castel Franco. Titian, then, drawing and painting\r\nwith Giorgione, as he was called, became in a short time so accomplished\r\nin art that when Giorgione was painting (in 1507-8) the façade of the\r\nFondaco de'Tedeschi, or Exchange of the German merchants, which looks\r\ntowards the Grand Canal, Titian was allotted the other side which faces\r\nthe market place, being at the time scarcely twenty years old. Here he\r\nrepresented a Judith of wonderful design and colour, so remarkable\r\nindeed, that when the work came to be uncovered it was commonly thought\r\nto be the work of Giorgione, and all the latter's friends congratulated\r\nhim (Giorgione) as being by far the best thing he had produced.\r\nWhereupon Giorgione, in great displeasure, replied that the work was\r\nfrom the hand of his pupil, who showed already how he could surpass his\r\nmaster and (what is more) Giorgione shut himself up for some days at\r\nhome, as if in despair, seeing that a young (_i.e._ younger) man knew\r\nmore than he did.\"\r\n\r\nAgain, in speaking of the famous altar-piece--the _Assumption_, now in\r\nthe Academy at Venice--painted by Titian in 1516, Dolce mentions him\r\ntwice as \"giovinetto.\" \"Not long afterwards he was commissioned to paint\r\na large picture for the high altar of the Church of the Frate Minori,\r\nwhere Titian, quite a young man, painted in oil the Virgin ascending to\r\nHeaven.... This was the first public work which he painted in oil, and\r\nhe did it in a very short time, and while still a young man.\"\r\n\r\nVasari's account of Titian's early years is substantially the same, but\r\nunfortunately opens with the statement that he was \"born in the year\r\n1480.\" This might easily have been a slip of the pen or a printer's\r\nmistake for 1488 or 1489, and subsequent passages in the life bear out\r\nthis supposition. But partly because Titian was a Venetian and not a\r\nFlorentine, and partly, no doubt, because he was still alive, and had\r\nbeen producing picture after picture for over sixty years at the time\r\nVasari published his second edition in 1568, the whole account is so\r\nconfused and inaccurate that its credit has been severely shaken by\r\nmodern critics, with the result that it is hardly nowadays considered\r\nauthentic in any respect. The following extracts, however, there seems\r\nno reason to question:----\r\n\r\n\"About the year 1507, Giorgione not being satisfied [with the\r\nold-fashioned methods of Bellini and others] began to give his works an\r\nunwonted softness and relief, painting them in a very beautiful manner.\"\r\nAnd a little later \"Having seen the manner of Giorgione, Titian early\r\nresolved to abandon that of Gian Bellino, although well grounded\r\ntherein. He now, therefore, devoted himself to this purpose, and in a\r\nshort time so closely imitated Giorgione that his pictures were\r\nsometimes taken for those of this master, as will be related below.\r\nIncreasing in age, judgment and facility of hand, our young artist\r\nexecuted numerous works in fresco.... At the time when he began to adopt\r\nthe manner of Giorgione, being then not more than eighteen, he took the\r\nportrait of a gentleman of the Barberigo family, who was his friend, and\r\nthis was considered very beautiful, the colouring being true and\r\nnatural, the hair so distinctly painted that each one could be counted,\r\nas might also the stitches in a satin doublet painted in the same work;\r\nin a word, it was so well and carefully done that it would have been\r\ntaken for a work of Giorgione if Titian had not written his name on the\r\ndark ground.\"\r\n\r\nWith this we may leave the question of Titian's birth date, and consider\r\nthe exceptional interest attaching to the question of this Barberigo\r\nportrait. According to Mr. Cook, and also, under reserve, to several\r\nother eminent authorities, it is no other than the so-called _Ariosto_,\r\nwhich was purchased for the National Gallery in 1904. The chief\r\ndifficulties in deciding the question are, first, whether it is possible\r\nthat a youth of eighteen could have painted such a masterpiece, second,\r\nthat the signature _Titianus_ is supposed not to have been used by the\r\nartist before about 1520, and lastly, that the head, at any rate, is\r\ndecidedly more in the manner of Giorgione than that of Titian. This\r\nlast, of course, did not trouble Vasari, and his testimony is therefore\r\nall the more valuable; but all difficulties vanish if we accept Mr.\r\nCook's theory that the portrait was begun by Giorgione in 1508, was left\r\nincomplete at his sudden death in 1510, and finished by Titian in 1520.\r\nThat is to say, the head and general design is that of Giorgione, the\r\nmarvellous finish of the sleeve and other parts that of Titian.\r\n\r\nOf works left unfinished at a master's death and completed by a pupil\r\nthere are numerous instances; the famous _Bacchanal_ at Alnwick is one\r\nwhich takes us a step further in Titian's career. This was begun by\r\nGiovanni Bellini, and Titian was invited by the Duke of Ferrara, in\r\n1516, to finish it. The landscape is entirely his. To complete the\r\ndecoration of the apartment in which the picture was hung, he was\r\ncalled upon to paint two others of the same size, one the _Triumph of\r\nBacchus_, or as it is usually called _Bacchus and Ariadne_ (now in the\r\nNational Gallery) and the other a similar subject, the _Bacchanal_, now\r\nin the Prado (No. 418, formerly 450).\r\n\r\nRidolfi, in his life of Titian characterises our picture as one to whose\r\nunparalleled merits he is inadequate to do justice; \"There is,\" he says,\r\n\"such a graceful expression in the figure of Ariadne, such beauty in the\r\nchildren--so strongly marked both in the looks and attitudes is the\r\njoyous character of the licentious votaries of Bacchus--the roundness\r\nand correct drawing of the man entwined with snakes, the magnificence of\r\nthe sky and landscape, the sporting play of the leaves and branches of\r\nthe most vivid tints, and the detailed herbage on the ground tending to\r\nenliven the scene, and the rich tone of colour throughout, form\r\naltogether such a whole that hardly any other work of Titian can stand\r\nin competition with it.\"\r\n\r\nIn the composition of the second picture, _The Bacchanal_ at Madrid, a\r\nnumber of the votaries of Bacchus are assembled on the bank of a\r\nrivulet, flowing with red wine from a hill in the distance; some of them\r\nare distributing the liquor to their associates, while a nymph and two\r\nmen are dancing. The nymph is supposed to be a portrait of Violante,\r\nTitan's mistress, as he has painted, in allusion to her name, a violet\r\non her breast and his own name round her arm. Her light drapery is\r\nraised by the breeze, and discovers the beautiful form and _morbidezza_\r\nof her limbs. In the foreground Ariadne lies asleep, her head resting on\r\na rich vase in place of a pillow.[3]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PLATE XIV.--TITIAN\r\n\r\nPORTRAIT SAID TO BE OF ARIOSTO\r\n\r\n_National Gallery, London_]\r\n\r\nCumberland says that Raphael Mengs, who lived long at Madrid at the time\r\nwhen this picture was in the reception room of the New Palace, was of\r\nopinion that Titian's superior taste was nowhere more strikingly\r\ndisplayed, and remarks that he himself could never pass by it without\r\nsurprise and admiration, more particularly excited by the beauty of the\r\nsleeping Ariadne in the foreground.\r\n\r\nRespecting the merits of both pictures the testimony of Agostino\r\nCarracci should not be omitted; when he viewed them in the possession of\r\nthe Duke of Ferrara he declared that he considered them the first in the\r\nworld, and that no one could say he was acquainted with the most\r\nmarvellous works of art without having seen them.\r\n\r\nCommenting upon another picture of Titian's early period, Sir Joshua\r\nReynolds delivers himself of the following criticisms on Titian as\r\ncompared with Raphael, \"It is to Titian that we must turn,\" he says, \"to\r\nfind excellence in regard to colour, and light and shade in the highest\r\ndegree. He was both the first and the greatest master of this art; by a\r\nfew strokes he knew how to mark the general image and character of\r\nwhatever object he attempted, and produced by this alone a truer\r\nrepresentation of nature than his master, Giovanni Bellini, or any of\r\nhis predecessors, who finished every hair. His greatest object was to\r\nexpress the general colour, to preserve the masses of light and shade,\r\nand to give by opposition the idea of that solidity which is inseparable\r\nfrom natural objects....\r\n\r\n\"Raphael and Titian seemed to have looked at nature for different\r\npurposes; they both had the power of extending their view to the whole,\r\nbut one looked only at the general effect as produced by form, the\r\nother as produced by colour. We cannot refuse Titian the merit of\r\nattending to the general form of the object, as well as colour; but his\r\ndeficiency lay--a deficiency at least when he is compared with\r\nRaphael--in not possessing the power, like him, of correcting the form\r\nof his model by any general idea of beauty in his own mind. Of this his\r\n_St. Sebastian with other Saints_ (in the Vatican) is a particular\r\ninstance. This figure appears to be a most exact representation both of\r\nthe form and colour of the model which he then happened to have before\r\nhim, and has all the force of nature, and the colouring of flesh itself;\r\nbut unluckily the model was of a bad form, especially the legs. Titian\r\nhas with much care preserved these defects, as he has imitated the\r\nbeauty and brilliancy of the colouring....\"\r\n\r\nOf the Sebastian, Vasari says very much the same as Reynolds. \"He is\r\nnude,\" he writes, \"and has been exactly copied from the life without the\r\nslightest admixture of art, no efforts for the sake of beauty have been\r\nsought in any part--trunk or limbs; all is as nature left it, so that it\r\nmight seem to be a sort of cast from the life. It is nevertheless\r\nconsidered very fine, and the figure of our Lady with the infant in her\r\narms, whom all the other figures are looking at, is also accounted most\r\nbeautiful.\"\r\n\r\nTwo more of the pictures of Titian's earliest period are in the National\r\nGallery--the _Christ appearing to Mary Magdalen_ (No. 270), and the\r\n_Holy Family_ (No. 4). The former is ascribed to about the year 1514,\r\npartly on the ground that the group of buildings in the landscape is\r\nidentical, line for line, with that in the Dresden _Venus_ painted by\r\nGiorgione but completed by Titian after his death. The same landscape\r\nalso occurs in the beautiful little _Cupid_ in the Vienna\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PLATE XV.--TITIAN\r\n\r\nTHE HOLY FAMILY\r\n\r\n_National Gallery, London_]\r\n\r\nAcademy, and, as Mr Herbert Cook suggests, possibly represents some\r\ncherished spot in Titian's memory connected with his mountain home at\r\nPieve di Cadore.\r\n\r\nThe _Holy Family_, above mentioned, is a most charming example of the\r\n_sacra conversazione_ as developed by Titian from the somewhat formal\r\nand austere conception of Bellini and his contemporaries into something\r\neminently characteristic of the secular side of his genius. The very\r\ntitles of two of his most beautiful and most famous pictures of this\r\nsort proclaim the hold they have taken on the popular mind. The one is\r\nthe _Madonna of the Cherries_, in the Vienna Gallery. The other is the\r\n_Madonna with the Rabbit_, in the Louvre. In our picture the\r\ndistinguishing feature is the kneeling shepherd, with his little\r\nwater-cask slung on his belt, who puts us at once in touch with the\r\nwhole scene by the simple appeal to our common human experience. Raphael\r\ncould move our religious feelings to revere the godhead in the child,\r\nbut could seldom, like Titian, stir our human emotions and bring home to\r\nus that Christ was born on earth for our sakes.\r\n\r\nIf this particular characteristic of Titian were confined to the\r\npastoral setting of these Holy Conversations, it might be taken as\r\nmerely accidental, and without further significance than should be\r\naccorded to a youthful fancy. But in the wonderful _Entombment_, now in\r\nthe Louvre, in which he displays \"the full splendour of his early\r\nmaturity,\" the human element is such an important factor in the\r\npresentment of the divine tragedy that even a painter, M.\r\nCaro-Delvaille, must postpone his description of the picture to\r\nsentences like these:--\"Sur un ciel tourmenté,\" he writes, in phrases\r\nwhich it is impossible to render adequately in English, \"se profile le\r\ngroupe tragique. Aucun geste superflu; le drame est intérieur. La\r\nDouleur plane dans l'air alourdi du crépuscule, comme une aile\r\nfatale--Jésus est mort! Le grand cadavre livide, que les apôtres\r\nangoissés soutiennent, n'a rien dans sa robustesse inerte de la\r\ndépouille émaciée des Christs mystiques. Le fils de Dieu semble un\r\npatriarche douloureusement frappé par le décret d'en haut.\r\n\r\n\"Une âpreté primitive, où les larmes se cachent comme une faiblesse,\r\ncommunique a l'oeuvre un pathétique si poignant que le mystère de la\r\nmort s'étend jusqu'à nous.\r\n\r\n\"La Vierge et la Madeleine sont là. Elle, la Mère, doute de la réalité,\r\ntant elle souffre! Son regard fixe sur le corps chéri, elle ne peut\r\ncroire que tout est consommé. La pécheresse pitoyable la prend dans ses\r\nbras pour essayer de l'arracher à l'horreur de cette vision.\r\n\r\n\"Drame humain et divin! ne sont-ce point des fils qui ramènent le\r\ncadavre de leur père à la poussière? Tous ceux qui passèrent par ces\r\népreuves se souviennent de ce deuil qui semble se prolonger dans la\r\nnature entière.\"\r\n\r\nTitian's first period may be said to end in 1530, by which time he had\r\ncompleted the famous _Peter Martyr_, which was destroyed by fire in\r\n1867. In 1530, too, Titian's wife died. This event of itself need not be\r\nsupposed to have greatly influenced his career, as there is no evidence\r\nof her having appealed to his artistic nature as did his daughter\r\nLavinia. As it happened, however, a more certain influence was nearly\r\ncoincident with this event--the arrival in Venice of the notorious\r\nAretine, who, chiefly as it appears, with an eye to business, entered\r\ninto the most intimate relations with Titian. The accession of the\r\nsculptor\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PLATE XVI.--TITIAN\r\n\r\nTHE ENTOMBMENT\r\n\r\n_Louvre, Paris_]\r\n\r\nSansovino to the comradeship earned for the group the name of the\r\nTriumvirate.\r\n\r\nSo far from Titian being corrupted by the society of Aretine, there is\r\ndirect evidence in one of the poet's letters to him that he was not.\r\n\"You must come to our feast to-night,\" he writes, \"but I may as well\r\nwarn you that you had better leave early, as I know how particular you\r\nare about certain things.\" Nor is there anything in the artist's works\r\nof this next period--which we may roughly date from 1530 to 1550, that\r\nbetrays a more serious devotion to the sensual side of life than can be\r\naccounted for by the demands of the high and mighty patrons that Aretine\r\nwas soon to find for him. As an artist he looked upon woman as a\r\nbeautiful creature, as a man he most probably never troubled about her,\r\nor was troubled by her. There is no proof that any of his pictures are\r\nrightly called \"Titian's mistress,\" and we may conclude that he was as\r\ngood a husband and a father as was Rubens, who revelled in painting\r\nwoman, or Velasquez, who seems to have frankly disliked it. Like\r\nRowlandson, whom the general public only know as a caricaturist, but who\r\nwhen he once got away from London was the most pure minded and poetical\r\nartist, so Titian, when once dissociated from the demands of corrupt\r\npatrons, like Philip II., never reveals himself as having fallen under\r\nthe influence of Aretine--if indeed at all. The _Danaë_ and the _Venus\r\nand a Musician_ at the Prado are the only examples it is possible to\r\ncite--unless it be the _Venus_, to which popular opinion would hardly\r\ndeny its place of honour in the Tribune at the Uffizi.\r\n\r\nAt the same time the difference in circumstances, the fuller, richer\r\nlife that he must have led in these years of patronage and prosperity,\r\naccounts for a certain \"shallowness and complacency\" which\r\ndistinguishes his work during this period as sharply from that which\r\npreceded as from that which followed it; and fine as is his\r\naccomplishment during these years, especially in portraiture, it\r\nincludes fewer of those masterpieces which appeal to the heart as much\r\nas to the eye.\r\n\r\nTo 1538 belongs the large and beautiful picture of the _Presentation of\r\nthe Virgin Mary in the Temple_, painted for the Scuola della Carità in\r\nVenice, which is now occupied by the Academy, where it still hangs, as\r\nis said, in its original place. It is twenty-two feet in length, and\r\ncontains several portraits, among which are those of his daughter\r\nLavinia (the Virgin, as is supposed), Andrea Franchescini, grand\r\nchancellor of Venice, in a scarlet robe; next him, in black, Lazzaro\r\nCrasso, a lawyer, and certain monks of the convent following them.\r\n\r\nWe now find Titian employed by the Duke of Urbino on some of the\r\nprincipal works of this period. Among these were the Uffizi _Venus_,\r\nsaid to be a portrait of the Duchess herself. The _Girl in a Fur Mantle_\r\nat Vienna, portraits of the Duke and of the Duchess (1537), and the\r\nso-called _La Bella_ at the Uffizi. The so-called _Duke of Norfolk_ at\r\nthe Pitti, supposed to represent the young Duke Guidobaldo of Urbino.\r\nAlso the _Isabella d'Este_ at Vienna, and somewhat earlier, the\r\n_Cardinal Ippolito_ in Hungarian dress, at the Pitti; and the _Daughter\r\nof Robert Strozzi_, at Berlin.\r\n\r\nThe large _Ecce Homo_ in the Vienna Gallery, dated 1543, measuring 11\r\nft. 3 in. by 7 ft. 7 in. was for some years in London, and with better\r\nfortune might still be in this country if not in our national\r\ncollection. It was one of the nineteen pictures by Titian in the\r\nwonderful collection of Rubens, which the Duke of Buckingham persuaded\r\nhim to sell to him for a fabulous price. The collection was shipped to\r\nEngland in 1625, when the pictures were taken to York House in the\r\nStrand, and the statues and gems to Chelsea. In 1649 a portion of the\r\ncollection was sold at Brussels, and the _Ecce Homo_ was purchased there\r\nby the Archduke Leopold for his gallery at Prague, which now forms part\r\nof that at Vienna. The Earl of Arundel offered the Duke of Buckingham\r\n£7000 for it--an unheard of price, especially when we remember the\r\ngreater value of money at that time.\r\n\r\nWith another masterpiece--fortunately still preserved in the Prado,\r\nthough not entirely uninjured by fire--we may close the second period.\r\nThis is the magnificent equestrian portrait of _The Emperor Charles V._\r\nwhich was painted at Augsburg in 1548. A few years later the Emperor\r\nabdicated in favour of his egregious son, Philip II., of whom Titian\r\npainted three portraits in succession. The second of these, now in the\r\nPrado, has an especial interest for us, inasmuch as it was painted for\r\nthe benefit or the enticement of Queen Mary before her marriage to\r\nPhilip. As might be expected, it is a highly flattering likeness,--in\r\nwhite and gold, in half armour. To quote M. Caro-Delvaille, this king of\r\n_auto da fés_ and sunken galleys is here nothing more than a gallant\r\ncavalier--neurasthenic but elegant. For England was also painted the\r\n_Venus and Adonis_, in 1554; but unfortunately the original is now in\r\nMadrid, and only a copy in our National Gallery. However, the remains of\r\nPhilip are there too, and not in Westminster Abbey!\r\n\r\nA copy of another famous picture painted by Titian for the Emperor\r\nCharles V. was also in the collection of the Duke of Buckingham, who\r\nprobably brought it with him when he returned from his madcap expedition\r\nwith Prince Charles to Madrid. It is described in his catalogue as \"One\r\ngreat Piece of the Emperor Charles, a copy called Titian's Glory, being\r\nthe principal in Spain, now in the Escurial.\" This was the great\r\n_Paradise_, or Apotheosis of Charles V. which Charles took with him into\r\nSpain at the time of his abdication and placed in the monastery of St.\r\nJuste, in Estramadura, to which he retired. After his death it was\r\nremoved by Philip II. to Madrid.\r\n\r\nOf the two versions of _The Crowning with Thorns_, the earlier one at\r\nthe Louvre, painted in 1560, is more familiar to, and probably more\r\npopular with, the general public than the much later one at Munich\r\npainted in 1571. But for the real merits of the two we need not hesitate\r\nto accept M. Caro-Delvaille's judgment, since if he had any bias it\r\nwould be in favour of his own country's treasure. The former he\r\ncharacterises as an incoherent composition, in which useless\r\ngesticulation diminishes the dramatic effect, while striving to force\r\nit; and adds that all the false romanticism of painting comes from this\r\nsort of theatrical pathos. Of the other he writes \"It was the picture at\r\nthe Louvre which shocked me with its violent declamation and its forced\r\nblows that never hit anything. But here at Munich a mystery so profound\r\nbroods over the drama that the melodramatic element disappears. The\r\nscene becomes tragic, lamentable, hopelessly sad. The great artist with\r\na brush that trembles in his aged hands paints but the sentiment of it,\r\nto exhale from his work like a plaintive sigh. The veil of death\r\ndescends and spreads over life.... Titian might seem to have painted it\r\nas an offering to Rembrandt when he, too, should feel the approach of\r\ndeath.\"\r\n\r\nAnother of his latest pictures, the _Adam and Eve in Paradise_, is in\r\nthe Prado (No. 429, formerly 456). This was copied, or one might almost\r\nsay travestied, by Rubens when he was at Madrid in 1629, and his work\r\nwas hung in the same room with it. As the colouring is of a lower tone\r\nthan is usual with Titian, and the attitudes of the figures extremely\r\nsimple and natural, the contrast is all the more marked, and was well\r\nexpressed by Cumberland, who said that \"when we contemplate Titian's\r\npicture of Adam and Eve we are convinced they never wore clothes; turn\r\nto the copy, and the same persons seem to have laid theirs aside.\"\r\n\r\nA more generous comparison between these two painters is made by\r\nReynolds in a note on du Fresnoy's poem on Painting respecting the\r\nqualities of regularity and uniformity. \"An instance occurs to me where\r\nthose two qualities are separately exhibited by two great painters,\r\nRubens and Titian: the picture of Rubens is in the Church of S.\r\nAugustine at Antwerp, the subject (if that may be called a subject where\r\nno story is represented) is the Virgin and Infant Christ placed high in\r\nthe picture on a pedestal with many saints about them and as many below\r\nthem, with others on the steps to serve as a link to unite the upper and\r\nlower part of the picture. The composition of this picture is perfect in\r\nits kind; the artist has shown the greatest skill in composing and\r\ncontrasting more than twenty figures without confusion and without\r\ncrowding; the whole appearing as much animated and in motion as it is\r\npossible where nothing is to be done.\r\n\r\n\"The picture of Titian which we would oppose to this is in the Church\r\nof the S. Frari at Venice (the \"Pesaro Madonna,\" where the two donors\r\nkneel below the Virgin enthroned). One peculiar character of this piece\r\nis grandeur and simplicity, which proceed in a great measure from the\r\nregularity of the composition, two of the principal figures being\r\nrepresented kneeling directly opposite to each other, and nearly in the\r\nsame attitude. This is what few painters would have had the courage to\r\nventure; Rubens would certainly have rejected so unpicturesque a mode of\r\ncomposition had it occurred to him. Both these pictures are excellent in\r\ntheir kind, and may be said to characterize their respective authors.\r\nThere is a bustle and animation in the work of Rubens, a quiet solemn\r\nmajesty in that of Titian. The excellence of Rubens is the picturesque\r\neffect he produces; the superior merit of Titian is in the appearance of\r\nbeing above seeking after any such \"artificial excellence.\"\r\n\r\nThe most important artist besides Titian who was a pupil of Giorgione\r\nwas SEBASTIANO DEL PIOMBO, as he was called--his father's name was\r\nLUCIANI. But as two other notable influences determined his career, he\r\nis not to be taken as typical of the Venetian School in general or that\r\nof Giorgione in particular. Born in Venice about the year 1485, he first\r\nstudied under Giovanni Bellini, as appears from the signature as well as\r\nfrom the style of a _Pietà_ by him in the Layard collection, which we\r\nmay hope soon to see in the National Gallery. Of his Giorgionesque\r\nperiod there is only one important picture known to us, the beautiful\r\naltar-piece in S. Giovanni Crisostomo in Venice, which is not far\r\nremoved from the richness of Titian's earlier work. The picture\r\nrepresents the mild and dignified S. Chrysostom seated, reading aloud at\r\na desk in an open hall; S. John the Baptist leaning on his cross is\r\nlooking attentively at him; behind him are two male and on the left two\r\nfemale saints listening devoutly, and in the foreground the Virgin\r\nlooking majestically out of the picture at the spectator--a splendid\r\ntype of the full and grand Venetian ideal of female beauty of that time.\r\nThe true expression of a _Santa Conversazione_ could not be more\r\nworthily given than in the relation in which the listeners stand to the\r\nreader, and in glow of colour this work is not inferior to the best of\r\nGiorgione's or Titian's.\r\n\r\nAs early as 1510, however, he not only left Venice, but also his\r\nVenetian manner. He was invited to Rome by the rich banker and patron of\r\nthe arts, Agostino Chigi, where he met Raphael, and with astonishing\r\nversatility succeeded as well in emulating the excellences of that\r\nmaster as he had those of Bellini and Giorgione. The half-length\r\n_Daughter of Herodias_ bequeathed to the National Gallery by George\r\nSalting is dated 1510, and in 1512 he painted the famous _Fornarina_ in\r\nthe Uffizi, which until the middle of the last century was supposed to\r\nbe a _chef d'oeuvre_ of Raphael. To this period also belongs the _S.\r\nJohn in the Desert_, at the Louvre.\r\n\r\nWithin the next seven years a still mightier influence found him, that\r\nof Michelangelo, and how far he was capable of responding to it may be\r\njudged by our great _Raising of Lazarus_, painted at Rome in 1517-19 for\r\nGiulio de'Medici, afterwards Pope Clement VII., to be placed with\r\nRaphael's _Transfiguration_ in the Cathedral of Narbonne. Both pictures\r\nwere publicly exhibited in Rome, and by some people Sebastiano's was\r\npreferred to Raphael's. According to Waagen the whole composition was\r\ndesigned by Michelangelo, with whom Sebastiano had entered into the\r\nclosest intimacy; and Kugler states that the group of Lazarus and those\r\naround him was actually drawn by the master. However that may be, we can\r\nhardly fail to see how entirely the Venetian influence is obscured by\r\nthat of the great Florentine, and to recognise the extraordinary genius\r\nof a painter who could do something more than imitate from such masters\r\nas Bellini, Giorgione, Raphael and Michelangelo.\r\n\r\nThe last traces of the Vivarini influence are to be seen in the earlier\r\nworks of LORENZO LOTTO(1480-1556), who was a pupil of Alvise, though his\r\npictures after 1508, when he had left Venice, Treviso and Reccanti,\r\nwhere he had been employed, show the effect of his changed surroundings.\r\nTo this date is assigned the _Portrait of a Young Man_, at Hampton\r\nCourt. At Rome in 1509 he was painting with Raphael in the Vatican, and\r\nin his next dated work, the _Entombment_, at Jesi, the echoes of\r\nRaphael's Disputation and the _School of Athens_ are clear. The Dresden\r\n_Madonna and Child with S. John_ was probably painted at Bergamo in\r\n1518, and the _Madonna and Saints_, lately bequeathed to the National\r\nGallery, is dated 1521.\r\n\r\nAt Madrid is a picture by him of _A Bride and Bridegroom_ dated 1523, to\r\nwhich year probably belongs the _Family Group_ in the National Gallery.\r\nThese are early instances of the comparatively rare inclusion of more\r\nthan a single figure in a pure portrait. In our example the father and\r\nmother and two children are composed into a delightful picture, in which\r\nfor once we may see the actual people of the time in something like\r\ntheir natural surroundings, instead of being posed, however effectively,\r\nto assist in the representation of some historic or legendary scene.\r\n\r\nIn 1527 Lotto was back again in Venice, and was probably influenced by\r\nPalma Vecchio when he painted the superb portrait of the sculptor\r\n_Odoni_, which is at Hampton Court. A little later the influence of\r\nTitian is more visible. Two other portraits are in our National Gallery,\r\nthose of the Protonotary Juliano and of Agostino and Niccolo della\r\nTorre.\r\n\r\nBONIFAZIO DI PITATI (1487-1553), sometimes called Bonifazio Veronese or\r\nVeneziano, was born at Verona, but studied in Venice under Palma\r\nVecchio. The influence of his native city distinguishes his work in some\r\ndegree from the pure Venetian, as it did that of the more famous Paolo\r\nin later years; but the atmosphere created by Giorgione was so strong as\r\nto cause Bonifazio's masterpiece (if we except the _Dives and Lazarus_\r\nat the Academy in Venice) to be attributed until quite lately to\r\nGiorgione. It is thus described by Kugler:--\"A picture in the Brera in\r\nMilan, very deserving of notice, is perhaps one of Giorgione's most\r\nbeautiful works; it is historic in subject, but romantic in conception.\r\nThe subject is the finding of Moses; all the figures are in the rich\r\ncostume of Giorgione's time. In the centre the princess sits under a\r\ntree, and looks with surprise at the child who is brought to her by a\r\nservant. The seneschal of the princess, with knights and ladies, stand\r\naround. On one side are seated two lovers on the grass, on the other\r\nside musicians and singers, pages with dogs, a dwarf with an ape, etc.\r\nIt is a picture in which the highest earthly splendour and enjoyment are\r\nbrought together, and the incident from Scripture only gives it a more\r\npleasing interest. The costume, however inappropriate to the story,\r\ndisturbs the effect as little as in other Venetian pictures of the same\r\nperiod, since it refers more to a poetic than to a mere historic truth,\r\nand the period itself was rich in poetry; its costume too assists the\r\ndisplay of a romantic splendour. This picture, with all its glow of\r\ncolour, is softer than the earlier works of the master, and reminds us\r\nof Titian....\"\r\n\r\nThe beautiful _Santa Conversazione_ in the National Gallery, again,\r\nwhich was formerly in the Casa Terzi at Bergamo, was there attributed to\r\nPalma Vecchio. Here the Virgin in a rose-coloured mantle is the centre\r\nof the composition, with the Child on her knee, whose foot the little S.\r\nJohn is bending to kiss. On the right is S. Catherine and on the left S.\r\nJames the Less and S. Jerome. In the landscape are seen a shepherd lying\r\nbeside his flock, while other shepherds are fleeing from a lion who has\r\nseized their dog. A copy of this composition is in the Academy at\r\nVenice.\r\n\r\nOddly enough it was a pupil of Bonifazio who employed the grand Venetian\r\nmanner in the humbler and more commonplace walks of life, and neglecting\r\nalike the _Sacra Conversazione_ and the pompous scenes of festivity,\r\ndeveloped into the first Italian painter of _genre_. This was JACOPO DA\r\nPONTE, called from his birthplace BASSANO, who was working in Venice\r\nunder Bonifazio as early as 1535. He afterwards returned to Bassano, and\r\nselecting those scenes in which he could most extensively introduce\r\ncottages, peasants, and animals, he connected them with events from\r\nsacred history or mythology. A peculiar feature by which his pictures\r\nmay be known is the invariable and apparently intentional hiding of the\r\nfeet of his figures, for which purpose sheep and cattle and household\r\nutensils are introduced. He confines himself to a bold, straightforward\r\nimitation of familiar objects, united, however, with pleasing\r\ncomposition, colour, and chiaroscuro. His colours, indeed, sparkle like\r\ngems, particularly the greens, in which he displays a brilliancy quite\r\npeculiar to himself. His lights are boldly infringed on the objects,\r\nand are seldom introduced except on prominent parts of the figures. In\r\naccordance with this treatment his handling is spirited and peculiar,\r\nsomewhat in the manner of Rembrandt; and what on close inspection\r\nappears dark and confused, forms at a distance the very strength and\r\nmagic of his colouring. The picture of the _Good Samaritan_ in the\r\nNational Gallery is a good example, and was formerly in the collection\r\nof Reynolds, who it is said always kept it in his studio. The _Portrait\r\nof a Man_ (No. 173) is excelled by that of an _Old Man_ at Berlin.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIII\r\n\r\nPAOLO VERONESE AND IL TINTORETTO\r\n\r\n\r\nIt cannot be said that the Venetian artists of the second half of the\r\nsixteenth century equalled in their collective excellence the great\r\nmasters of the first, but in single instances they are frequently\r\nentitled to rank beside them. At the head of these is JACOPO ROBUSTI\r\n(1518-1594), called IL TINTORETTO (the dyer), in allusion to his\r\nfather's trade. He was one of the most vigorous painters in all the\r\nhistory of art; one who sought rather than avoided the greatest\r\ndifficulties, and who possessed a true feeling for animation and\r\ngrandeur. If his works do not always charm, it should be imputed to the\r\nforeign and non-Venetian element which he adopted, but never completely\r\nmastered; and also to the times in which he lived, when Venetian art had\r\nfallen somewhat into the mistaken way of colossal and rapid\r\nproductiveness. His off-hand style, as Kugler calls it, is always full\r\nof grand and significant detail, and with a few patches of colour he\r\nsometimes achieves the liveliest forms and expressions. But he fails in\r\nthat artistic arrangement of the whole and in that nobility of motives\r\nin the parts which are necessary exponents of a really high ideal. His\r\ncompositions are achieved less by finely studied degrees of\r\nparticipation in the principal action than by great masses of light and\r\nshade. Attitudes and movements are taken immediately from common life,\r\nnot chosen from the best models. With Titian the highest ideal of\r\nearthly happiness in existence is expressed by beauty; with Tintoretto\r\nin mere animal strength, sometimes of an almost rude character.\r\n\r\nFor a short time he was a pupil of Titian, but for some unknown reason\r\nhe soon left him, and struck out for himself. In the studio which he\r\noccupied in his youth he had inscribed, as a definition of the style he\r\nprofessed, \"The drawing of Michelangelo, the colouring of Titian.\" He\r\ncopied the works of the latter, and also designed from casts of\r\nFlorentine and antique sculpture, particularly by lamplight--as did\r\nRomney a couple of centuries later--to exercise himself in a more\r\nforcible style of relief. He also made models for his works, which he\r\nlighted artificially, or hung up in his room, in order to master\r\nperspective. By these means he united great strength of shadow with the\r\nVenetian colouring, which gives a peculiar character to his pictures,\r\nand is very successful when limited to the direct imitation of nature.\r\nBut apart from the impossibility of combining two such totally different\r\nexcellences as the colouring of Titian and the drawing of Michelangelo,\r\nit appears that Tintoretto's acquaintance with the works of the latter\r\nonly developed his tendency to a naturalistic style. That which with\r\nMichelangelo was the symbol of a higher power in nature was adopted by\r\nTintoretto in its literal form. Most of his defects, it is probable,\r\narose from his indefatigable vigour, which earned for him the nickname\r\nof _Il Furioso_. Sebastian del Piombo said that Tintoretto could paint\r\nas much in two days as would occupy him two years. Other sayings were\r\nthat he had three brushes, one of gold, one of silver, and a third of\r\nbrass, and that if he was sometimes equal to Titian he was often\r\ninferior to Tintoretto! In this last category Kugler puts two of his\r\nearliest works, the enormous _Last Judgment_, and _The Golden Calf_, in\r\nthe church of S. Maria dell'Orto, while on his much later _Last Supper_\r\nhe is still more severe. \"Nothing more utterly derogatory,\" he writes,\r\n\"both to the dignity of art and to the nature of the subject can be\r\nimagined. S. John is seen with folded arms, fast asleep, while others of\r\nthe Apostles with the most burlesque gestures are asking, 'Lord, is it\r\nI?' Another Apostle is uncovering a dish which stands on the floor\r\nwithout remarking that a cat has stolen in and is eating from it. A\r\nsecond is reaching towards a flask; a beggar sits by, eating. Attendants\r\nfill up the picture. To judge from an overthrown chair the scene appears\r\nto have been a revel of the lowest description. It is strange that a\r\npainter should venture on such a representation of this subject scarcely\r\na hundred years after the creation of Leonardo da Vinci's _Last\r\nSupper_.\"\r\n\r\nIt was in 1548, when but thirty years old, that Tintoretto first became\r\nfamous, with the large _Miracle of S. Mark_, now in the Venice Academy.\r\nThis is perhaps his finest as well as his most celebrated work; but the\r\ngreatest monument to his industry and general ability is the Scuola\r\ndi'San Rocco, where he began to work in 1560 under a contract to produce\r\nthree pictures a year for an annuity of a hundred ducats. In all there\r\nare sixty-two of his pictures in this building, the greater part of\r\nthem very large, the figures throughout being of the size of life. _The\r\nCrucifixion_, painted in 1565, is the most extensive of them, and on the\r\nwhole the most perfect. In 1590, four years before his death, he\r\ncompleted the enormous _Paradise_ in the Sala del Gran Consiglio,\r\nmeasuring seventy-four feet in length and thirty in height.\r\n\r\nIn the National Gallery we have three characteristic examples,\r\nfortunately on a smaller scale, namely, the _S. George_ on a white\r\nhorse, which, with its greyish flesh tones and the blue of the\r\nprincess's mantle, is cooler in tone than the generality of his\r\npictures; _Christ washing the Disciples' Feet_, and the very beautiful\r\nand radiant _Origin of the Milky Way_, purchased from Lord Darnley in\r\n1890. At Hampton Court a still finer example, _The Nine Muses_, is so\r\ndiscoloured by age and hung in such a difficult light that it is\r\nimpossible to enjoy its full beauty.\r\n\r\nPAOLO CALIARI, better known as VERONESE, was born ten years later than\r\nTintoretto, and died six years before him (1528-1588). He studied in his\r\nnative city of Verona till he was twenty, and after working for some\r\ntime at Mantua he came to Venice in 1555, where he was quickly\r\nrecognised by Titian and by Sansovino, the sculptor and Director of\r\nPublic Buildings, and was commissioned in that year to paint a\r\n_Coronation of the Virgin_ and other works in the church of S.\r\nSebastian. The _Martyrdom of S. Giustino_, now in the Uffizi, and the\r\n_Madonna and Child_ in the Louvre are also among his earlier works. As\r\nearly as 1562 he was at work on the enormous _Feast at Cana_, now in the\r\nLouvre, and a similar work at Dresden is of the same date. In 1564 he\r\nwent to Rome, where he studied the works of Raphael and Michelangelo. On\r\nhis return to Venice in\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PLATE XVII.--TINTORETTO\r\n\r\nST GEORGE AND THE DRAGON\r\n\r\n_National Gallery, London_]\r\n\r\n1565--after visiting Verona, where he painted in his parish church, and\r\nalso married--he was employed to decorate the Ducal Palace, but much of\r\nhis best work there was destroyed by fire. Two of his most important\r\nworks completed before 1573 are in the Academy at Venice, _The Battle of\r\nLepanto_ and the _Feast in the House of Levi_. In this last he incurred\r\nstrictures from the Inquisition more severe than those of Kugler upon\r\nTintoretto's _Last Supper_, and possibly with as much reason, it being\r\nobjected that the introduction of German soldiery, buffoons, and a\r\nparrot was \"irreligious.\" His _Family of Darius_, now in the National\r\nGallery, was one of his latest works.\r\n\r\nVeronese, even more than Titian, whom in colouring he sought to emulate,\r\nand Tintoretto, whom in this respect he certainly excelled, expresses\r\nthe spirit of the Venetians of his time--a powerful and noble race of\r\nhuman beings, as Kugler calls them, elate with the consciousness of\r\nexistence, and in full enjoyment of all that renders earth attractive.\r\nBy the splendour of his colour, assisted by rich draperies and other\r\nmaterials, by a very clear and transparent treatment of the shadows, he\r\ninfused a magic into his great canvases which surpasses almost all the\r\nother masters of the Venetian School. Never had the pomp of colour, on a\r\nlarge scale, been so exalted and glorified as in his works. This, his\r\npeculiar quality, is most decidedly and grandly developed in scenes of\r\nworldly splendour; he loved to paint festive subjects for the\r\nrefectories of rich convents, suggested of course from particular\r\npassages in the Scriptures, but treated with the greatest freedom,\r\nespecially as regards the costume, which is always of his own time.\r\nInstead, therefore, of any religious sentiment, we are presented with a\r\ndisplay of the most cheerful human scenes and the richest worldly\r\nsplendour. That which distinguishes him from Tintoretto, and which in\r\nhis later period, after the death of Titian and Michelangelo, earned for\r\nhim the rank of the first living master, was that beautiful vitality,\r\nthat poetic feeling, which as far as it was possible he infused into a\r\ndeclining period of art. At the same time it becomes more and more\r\nevident, as our attention is turned to the deeper and nobler spirit of\r\nthe earlier masters in Venice, that the beauty of his figures is more\r\naddressed to the senses than to the soul, and that his naturalistic\r\ntendencies are often allowed to run wild.\r\n\r\nThe most celebrated, and as it happens the most historically\r\ninteresting, of his great pictures is the _Feast at Cana_, in the\r\nLouvre, measuring thirty feet wide and twenty feet high. This was\r\nformerly in the refectory of S. Giorgio Maggiore in Venice. The scene is\r\na brilliant atrium, surrounded by majestic pillars. The tables at which\r\nthe guests are seated form three sides of a parallelogram. The guests\r\nare supposed to be almost entirely contemporary portraits, so that the\r\nfigures of Christ and His mother, of themselves insignificant enough,\r\nlose even more in the general interest of the subject. Servants occupy\r\nthe foreground, while on the raised balustrades and the balconies of\r\ndistant houses are innumerable onlookers. The most remarkable feature of\r\nthe whole composition is a group of musicians in the centre of the\r\nforeground, which are portraits of the artist himself and Tintoretto,\r\nplaying on violon-cellos, and Titian, in a red robe, with the\r\ncontra-bass.\r\n\r\n_Christ in the House of Simon_, the Magdalen washing His feet, is\r\nanother scarcely less gigantic picture in the Louvre; but it is much\r\nsimpler in arrangement, and is distinguished by the fineness of the\r\nheads, especially that of the Christ. An interesting piece of technical\r\ncriticism on the _Feast at Cana_ occurs in Reynolds's Eighth\r\nDiscourse:--\r\n\r\n\"Another instance occurs to me,\" he says, \"where equal liberty may be\r\ntaken in regard to the management of light. Though the general practice\r\nis to make a large mass about the middle of the picture surrounded by\r\nshadow, the reverse may be practised, and the spirit of rule may still\r\nbe preserved.... In the great composition of Paul Veronese, the\r\n_Marriage at Cana_, the figures are for the most part in half shadow;\r\nthe great light is in the sky; and indeed the general effect of this\r\npicture, which is so striking, is no more than what we often see in\r\nlandscapes, in small pictures of fairs and country feasts; but those\r\nprinciples of light and shadow, being transferred to a large scale, to a\r\nspace containing near a hundred figures as large as life, and conducted\r\nto all appearance with as much facility and with an attention as\r\nsteadily fixed upon the _whole together_ as if it were a small picture\r\nimmediately under the eye, the work justly excites our admiration; the\r\ndifficulty being increased as the extent is enlarged.\"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nWith the death of the great Venetians, Titian, Tintoretto, and Paul\r\nVeronese, in the last quarter of the sixteenth century, the history of\r\nItalian painting of the first rank comes to an end. In Florence, the\r\nimitation of Michelangelo was the chief object striven after, and, as\r\nmight be expected, the attempt was not eminently successful. The greater\r\nnumber of the Italian painters of the early seventeenth century who\r\nattained any fame are known by the name of Eclectics, from their having\r\nendeavoured, instead of imitating any one of their great predecessors,\r\nto select and unite the best qualities of each, without, however,\r\nexcluding the direct study of nature. The fallacy of this aim, when\r\ncarried to an extreme, is, of course, that the greatness of the earlier\r\nmasters consisted really in their individual and peculiar qualities, and\r\nto endeavour to unite characteristics essentially different involves a\r\ncontradiction.\r\n\r\nThe most important of the Eclectic schools was that of the Carracci, at\r\nBologna, which was founded by LODOVICO CARRACCI (_c_. 1555-1619), a\r\nscholar of Prospero Fontana and Passignano at Florence. In his youth he\r\nwas nicknamed \"the ox,\" partly from his slowness, but possibly also for\r\nhis study of long-forgotten methods, by which he arrived at the decision\r\nthat reform was necessary to counteract the independence of the\r\nmannerists. He therefore obtained the assistance of his two nephews,\r\nAGOSTINO and ANNIBALE CARRACCI, sons of a tailor, and in concert with\r\nthem opened an academy at Bologna in 1589. This he furnished with casts,\r\ndrawings, and engravings, and provided living models and gave\r\ninstruction in perspective, anatomy, etc. In spite of opposition this\r\nacademy became more and more popular, and before long all the other\r\nschools of art in Bologna were closed.\r\n\r\nThe principles of their teaching was succinctly expressed in a sonnet\r\nwritten by Agostino, in substance as follows:--\"Let him who wishes to be\r\na good painter acquire the design of Rome, Venetian action and\r\nchiaroscuro, the dignified colouring of Lombardy (that is to say, of\r\nLeonardo da Vinci), the terrible manner of Michelangelo, Titian's truth\r\nand nature, the sovereign purity of Correggio, and the perfect symmetry\r\nof Raphael. The decorum and well-grounded study of Tibaldi, the\r\ninvention of the learned Primaticcio, and a _little_ of the grace of\r\nParmigiano.\"\r\n\r\nThis \"patchwork ideal,\" as Kugler calls it, was, however, but a\r\ntransition step in the history of the Carracci and their art. In the\r\nprime of their activity they threw off a great deal of their\r\neclecticism, and attained an independence of their own. The merit of\r\nLodovico is chiefly that of a reformer and a teacher, and the pictures\r\nby Agostino are few and of no great account. But in Annibale we find\r\nmuch more than imitation of the characteristics of great masters. In his\r\nearlier works there are rather obvious traces of Correggio and Paul\r\nVeronese, but under the influence of the works of Raphael and\r\nMichelangelo and of the antique, as he understood it, he developed a\r\nstyle of his own. Though in recent years he is a little out of fashion\r\nwith the public, there is no question about his having a place among the\r\ngreater artists. To show how opinion can change, I venture to quote a\r\npassage from a letter written to me on the subject of Carracci's _The\r\nThree Maries_, lately presented to the National Gallery by the Countess\r\nof Carlisle:--\"I saw the gallery at Castle Howard in 1850. _The Three\r\nMaries_ was then still regarded as one of _the_ great pictures of the\r\nworld; and they told the story of how Lord Carlisle and Lord Ellesmere\r\nand Lord----, who shared the Paris purchases [after the Peace of 1815]\r\nbetween them, had to cast lots for this, because it was thought to be\r\nworth more than all the rest of the spoil.\"\r\n\r\nThe most important, or at any rate one of the most popular, of the\r\npupils of Carracci was DOMENICO ZAMPIERI, commonly called DOMENICHINO\r\n(1581-1641). If we are less enthusiastic about him at the present, it\r\nmay still be remembered that Constable particularly admired him, but it\r\nis significant that the four examples in the National Gallery are\r\nnumbered 48, 75, 77 and 85--there is no more recent acquisition. He had\r\ngreat facility, and his compositions--not always original--are treated\r\nwith great charm if with no real depth. His most famous picture, the\r\n_Communion of S. Jerome_, now in the Vatican, is closely imitated from\r\nAgostino Carracci's.\r\n\r\nGUIDO RENI (1575-1642), even more popular in the eighteenth and early\r\nnineteenth centuries than Domenichino, was as skilful in some respects,\r\nbut hardly as admirable. The _Ecce Homo_, bequeathed by Samuel Rogers to\r\nthe National Gallery, is an excellent example of his ability to charm\r\nthe sentimentalist, and if ever there should be a popular revival of\r\ntaste in the direction of the now neglected school of the Carracci, he\r\nwill possibly resume all the honour formerly paid to him. The same can\r\nhardly be predicted for the far inferior Carlo Maratti, Guercino, and\r\nCarlo Dolce.\r\n\r\nSpace forbids me more than the bare mention in these pages of the\r\nbrilliant revival of painting in Venice during the earlier part of the\r\neighteenth century by ANTONIO CANALE (1697-1768), GIOVANNI BATTISTA\r\nTIEPOLO (1692-1769), PIETRO LONGHI (1702-1785), and FRANCESCO GUARDI\r\n(1712-1793). Charming as their excellent accomplishments were, they must\r\ngive place to more important claims awaiting our attention in other\r\ncountries.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_SPANISH SCHOOL_\r\n\r\n\r\nOne of the sensations of the Exhibition of Spanish Old Masters at the\r\nGrafton Gallery in the autumn of 1913 was an altar panel, dated 1250,\r\nwhich was acquired by Mr Roger Fry in Paris, and catalogued as of the\r\n\"Early Catalan School.\" In view of the fact that this picture is\r\n\"certainly to be regarded as one of the very oldest of primitive\r\npictures painted on wood in any country ... a decade earlier than the\r\npicture by Margaritone in the National Gallery,\" it seems somewhat\r\ndogmatic to assert that while retaining a strongly Byzantine character\r\n\"the style is distinctly that of Catalonia.\" What was the style of\r\nCatalonia?\r\n\r\nSo far as the history of the art is concerned, the chapter on Spain is,\r\nwith one exception, a very short and a singularly uninteresting one,\r\nwhether Mr Fry's panel was painted in Catalonia or whether it was not;\r\nand in spite of every effort to find in this uncongenial country that\r\nexpansion of painting that might reasonably have been expected to flow\r\nfrom Italy and moisten its barren soil for the production of so\r\nwonderful a genius as Velasquez, there is positively nothing earlier\r\nthan Velasquez, and not very much after him, that has more than what we\r\nmay call a documentary interest. While in Italy or the Netherlands the\r\nnames of scores of painters earlier than the seventeenth century are\r\nendeared to us by the recollection of the works they have left us, the\r\nenumeration of those of the few Spaniards of whom we have any knowledge\r\nawakens no such thrill, and if we have ever heard of them, their works\r\nmean little more to us than their names. Only when we come within touch\r\nof Velasquez does our interest awaken--as in the case of Ribera and\r\nZurbaran--and that is less because of them than because of Velasquez. El\r\nGreco was not a Spaniard by birth, but a Cretan; and if he were ranged\r\nwith the Italians, to whom he more properly belongs, he would scarcely\r\nbe more famous than some Bolognese masters whose names are now--or\r\nperhaps we ought to say, at the present moment--almost forgotten. The\r\nannouncement that one of his portraits has been sold to an American for\r\n£30,000 is of commercial rather than of artistic interest.\r\n\r\nIf one had to sum up the career and the art of Velasquez in a sentence,\r\nit might be done by calling him a Court painter who never flattered.\r\nAfter recording his life from the time when he left his master Pacheco\r\nto enter the service of Philip IV. to the day that he died in it, we\r\nshall find that only a bare percentage of his work was not commissioned\r\nby the king; and in all his pictures which were not simply portraits\r\nthere is little if anything to be found which is not as literal and\r\ntruthful a presentment of the model in front of him as the life-like\r\nrepresentations of Philip and those about his Court, of which the\r\nsupreme quality is that of living resemblance, or to put it in more\r\ngeneral terms, vivid realism. Gifted as he must have been with an\r\nextraordinary vision and a still rarer, if not unique, ability to put\r\ndown on canvas what he saw, he confined himself entirely within the\r\nlimits of actuality, and thereby attained to heights which his great\r\ncontemporaries Rubens and Rembrandt in their noblest flights of\r\nimagination never reached.\r\n\r\nVelasquez was baptised on the 6th of June 1599, in the church of S.\r\nPeter at Seville. He was the son of well-to-do parents; his father, a\r\nnative of Seville, was named Juan Rodriguez de Silva, his mother\r\nGeronima Velasquez. At thirteen years old he had displayed so strong an\r\ninclination towards painting that he was put to study under Francisco de\r\nHerrera, then the most considerable painter in Spain (his son, also\r\nFrancisco, was the painter of the _Christ Disputing with the Doctors_,\r\nin the National Gallery), but owing to Herrera's violent temper\r\nVelasquez was shortly transferred to the studio of Francisco Pacheco,\r\nwhose daughter he eventually married.\r\n\r\nPacheco who was, besides being an accomplished artist, a man of literary\r\ntastes, and much sought after in Seville by the more intellectual class\r\nof society, was exceedingly proud of his pupil, and said of him that he\r\nwas induced to bestow the hand of his daughter upon him \"by the\r\nrectitude of his conduct, the purity of his morals, and his great\r\ntalents, and from the high expectation he entertained of his natural\r\nabilities and transcendent genius,\" adding that the honour of having\r\nbeen his instructor was far greater than that of being his\r\nfather-in-law, and that he felt it no demerit to be surpassed by so\r\nbrilliant a pupil.\r\n\r\nIn 1649 Pacheco published a book on painting, in which we are told that\r\nthe first attempts of Velasquez were studies in still life, or simple\r\ncompositions of actual figures, called _bodegones_ in Spanish, of which\r\nwe have a fair example at the National Gallery in the _Christ at the\r\nHouse of Martha_. Sir Frederick Cook, at Richmond, has another, an _Old\r\nWoman Frying Eggs_, and the Duke of Wellington two more, of which _The\r\nWater Carrier of Seville_ is probably the summit of the young painter's\r\nachievement before he left Seville, in 1623, and entered the service of\r\nPhilip IV. as Court painter.\r\n\r\nHis first portrait of the king was the magnificent whole length in the\r\nPrado Gallery, now numbered 1182, standing in front of a table with a\r\nletter in his right hand. No. 1183 is the head of the same portrait,\r\npossibly done as a study for it. Philip was so pleased with this that he\r\nordered all existing portraits of himself to be removed from the palace,\r\nand appointed Velasquez exclusively as his painter.\r\n\r\nAnother of his earliest successes at Court was the whole length portrait\r\nof the king's brother, Don Carlos, holding a glove in his right hand;\r\nand the picture now in the Museum at Rouen of _A Geographer_ is probably\r\nof this date.\r\n\r\nIn 1628, when Velasquez was still quite young, and had fallen under no\r\ninfluence save that of Pacheco and the school of Seville, he was charged\r\nby the king to entertain Rubens, who came to the Spanish Court on a\r\ndiplomatic mission, and show him all the treasures in the palace. If any\r\none could influence Velasquez, we might suppose it would have been\r\nRubens, who was not only a great painter, but a man of the most\r\ncaptivating manners and disposition, ever ready to help younger artists.\r\nBut not only did he have no perceptible effect on the style of\r\nVelasquez, but in the picture of _The Topers_, which must have been\r\npainted while Rubens was at Madrid, or very shortly after he left, we\r\ncan almost see a determination not to be influenced by him; for the\r\nsubject was a favourite one of Rubens's, and yet there is nothing in\r\nthis most realistic presentment of\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PLATE XVIII.--VELAZQUEZ\r\n\r\nTHE INFANTE PHILIP PROSPER\r\n\r\n_Imperial Gallery, Vienna_]\r\n\r\nactual figures under the title of Bacchus and his votaries which has\r\nanything at all in common with the florid and imaginative compositions\r\nof the Flemish painter. Velasquez had begun as a realist, and a realist\r\nhe was to continue till the end of his days.\r\n\r\nShortly after painting this picture he left his native country for the\r\nfirst time, and visited Venice and Rome. At Venice he made copies of\r\nTintoretto's _Last Supper_ and _Crucifixion_; but little if any of\r\nTintoretto's influence is to be seen in the two pictures he painted in\r\nRome--_The Forge of Vulcan_ and _Joseph's Coat_, both of which are still\r\nas realistic as ever in treatment, though showing great advances in\r\ntechnical skill. Soon after his return to Spain in 1631, he probably\r\npainted the magnificent whole length _Philip IV._ in the National\r\nGallery, which compares so well, on examination with the more popular\r\nand showy _Admiral Pulido Pareja_ purchased some years ago from Longford\r\nCastle. Senor Beruete, who has studied the work of Velasquez more\r\nclosely and more intelligently than any one else, considers that whereas\r\nthere is not a single touch upon the former that is not from the brush\r\nof Velasquez, the latter cannot be properly attributed to him at\r\nall--any more than can another popular favourite, the _Alexandro del\r\nBorro_ in the Berlin Gallery, now given to Bernard Strozzi.\r\n\r\nTo this period may be also assigned the _Christ at the Column_ in the\r\nNational Gallery, a picture which though not at first sight attractive,\r\nis nevertheless as fine in technique, and in sentiment, as any other\r\npicture in the Spanish room, and deserves far more attention than is\r\nusually given to it. Its simple realism and its pathetic sweetness are\r\nqualities which are wanting in many a more showy or sensational\r\ncomposition, and the more it is studied the nearer we find we are\r\ngetting to the real excellences that distinguish Velasquez from any\r\npainter who has ever lived. The _Crucifixion_ at the Prado is perhaps\r\nmore wonderful, but the familiar subject helps the imagination of the\r\nspectator to admire it, whereas the unfamiliar setting of our picture is\r\napt at first sight to repel.\r\n\r\nThe most important composition undertaken by Velasquez in this middle\r\nperiod of his career--that is to say between his two visits to Italy in\r\n1629 and 1649--is the famous _Surrender of Breda_, or, as it is\r\nsometimes called, _The Lances_. Soon after his arrival in Madrid he had\r\nonce painted an historical subject, _The Expulsion of the Moors_, in\r\ncompetition with his rivals who had asserted that he could paint nothing\r\nbut heads. In this competition the prize was awarded to him, but as the\r\npicture has perished we are unable to judge of its merits for ourselves.\r\nBut apart from this, and such unimportant groups of figures as we have\r\nmentioned, he had been occupied wholly in painting single portraits, and\r\nit is a marvellous proof of his genius that he should produce such a\r\nmasterpiece of composition as _The Lances_ with so little practice in\r\nthis branch of his art. Here, at least, we might have expected to trace\r\nthe influence of Rubens, but there is actually no sign of it; and if he\r\nsought any inspiration at all from other painters, it was from what he\r\nrecalled of Tintoretto's work which he had seen and studied in Venice.\r\n\r\nIn the king's eldest boy, _Baltazar Carlos_, who was born in 1629,\r\nVelasquez found a model for two or three of his most charming pictures.\r\nOne is at Castle Howard; a second the equestrian portrait, on a\r\ngalloping pony, at the Prado; and a third the full length hunting\r\nportrait, also at the Prado, in which we see the little prince standing\r\nunder a tree, gun in hand, with an enormous dog lying beside him.\r\nAnother is at Vienna, representing him as of about eleven years old,\r\nfull length, with his hand resting on the back of a chair. All of these\r\nowe some of their charm to the youth and attractive personality of the\r\nsubject; but if we want to see the power of Velasquez without any\r\noutside element to help us to appreciate it, there is the portrait of\r\nthe sculptor _Martinez Montanes_ at the Prado. \"The head is wonderful in\r\nits colour and its modelling,\" writes Senor Beruete; \"and what a lesson\r\nin technique! The eyes, lightly touched with colour, are set deep in\r\ntheir sockets, and surmounted by a strongly marked forehead. The high\r\nlights are of a rich _impasto_, manipulated with extraordinary skill;\r\nthe greyer tones of the flesh, so true and so delicate, are painted in a\r\nway that brings out with marvellous truth, both the soft parts of the\r\ncheeks and the harder structure of the face, under which one can follow\r\nthe bones of the nose and forehead.... Everything in the picture is\r\nspontaneous, and one can see that it is a pledge of friendship given by\r\none artist to another; there is nothing here of that artificial\r\narrangement that spoils commissioned portraits even when they are the\r\nwork of a painter as independent as Velasquez was. One feels here the\r\nassurance of an artist who knows that his work will be understood by his\r\nfriend in the spirit in which it was executed.\" M. Lefort, the French\r\ncritic, is even more enthusiastic. \"Ah! these redoubtable neighbours,\"\r\nhe exclaims, seeing it surrounded by the works of other painters at the\r\nPrado. \"This canvas makes them look like mere imitations--dead\r\nconventional likenesses. Van Dyck is dull, Rubens oily, Tintoret yellow;\r\nit is Velasquez alone who can give us the illusion of life in all its\r\nfulness!\"\r\n\r\nIn 1649 Velasquez paid his second visit to Rome, where he painted the\r\nfamous portrait of His Holiness, _Pope Innocent X._ which is now in the\r\nDoria palace. This is exceptional in treatment, inasmuch as it is the\r\nonly portrait by Velasquez in which the subject is seated--excepting of\r\ncourse equestrian portraits--and instead of the usual quiet tones of\r\ngrey and brown which he was so fond of employing, the picture of the\r\nPope is a radiant harmony of rose red and white. In its realism it is\r\neven more surprising than most of the other portraits, considering how\r\nugly the face had to be made to resemble nature, although the sitter was\r\nof a still higher rank than Velasquez's royal master.\r\n\r\nReturning to Madrid in 1651, Velasquez never again left Spain, and the\r\nremaining twenty years of his life may be considered the third period of\r\nhis artistic development, inasmuch as no special influence was exerted\r\nupon him outside the ordinary and somewhat tedious course of his\r\nemployment at the Court. To this period are assigned twenty-six\r\npictures--Senor Beruete only admits the authenticity of eighty-three in\r\nall, it may be mentioned--twelve of which are royal portraits, seven\r\nthose of buffoons and dwarfs, three mythological and two sacred\r\nsubjects, and the two famous pieces of real life, _Las Meninas_ and _Las\r\nHilanderas_.\r\n\r\nOf the royal portraits those of the _Infanta Margarita_ are among the\r\nmost fascinating, no less from their technical excellence than on\r\naccount of the youthful charm of the little Princess. The one at Vienna\r\nrepresents her as about three years old, dressed in red, standing by a\r\nlittle table. Of this, Senor Beruete says that it is \"one of the most\r\nbeautiful inspirations of Velasquez, and perhaps one that reveals better\r\nthan any other his power as a colourist; it is a flower, perfumed with\r\nevery infantine grace.\" Another standing portrait, though only a half\r\nlength, when she was not many years older, is that in the Salon Carré at\r\nthe Louvre, which is more familiar to us being nearer home and more\r\noften reproduced. M. de Wyczewa praises it thus:--\"The perfect\r\n_chefs-d'oeuvre_ collected in this glorious salon pale in the presence\r\nof this child portrait; not one of them can bear comparison with this\r\nsimple yet powerful painting, which seems to aim only at external\r\nresemblance and without other effort to attain a mysterious beauty of\r\nform and colour.\" At Frankfort again is a charming picture of the little\r\nPrincess, whole length, at the age of six or seven--a replica of which\r\nis at Vienna. She is dressed in greyish white with trimmings of black,\r\nand her hoop skirt is so enormous that her arms have to be stretched out\r\nstraight to allow her hands to reach the edge of her coat.\r\n\r\nOf the three mythological subjects two are in the Prado, namely the\r\n_Mars_ and the _Mercury and Argus_, while the third and most beautiful\r\nis the _Venus at the Mirror_ recently purchased for our national\r\ncollection. These were all of them painted for the decoration of the\r\nroyal palaces, and we may therefore suppose that the artist was not\r\nentirely at liberty either in the choice of his subject or in his method\r\nof treating it. Certainly he does not seem to have been fond of painting\r\nthe nude, unless with men, and it is noticeable that he has posed his\r\nmodel in this case with more modesty and reserve than is to be observed\r\nin the pictures of Rubens and Titian. The Holy Church was sternly averse\r\nto this class of painting, in which, accordingly, none of the Spanish\r\nschool indulged; but at the same time the royal galleries did not\r\nexclude the most exuberant fancies of Rubens, Titian, Tintoretto, and\r\nothers, and Velasquez was in all probability commissioned by Philip to\r\npaint this Venus--and another which has perished--along with the Mars\r\nand Mercury without regard to the ecclesiastical authorities. But it is\r\nhardly surprising if Velasquez availed himself less fully of the\r\nprivilege than a Flemish or Italian painter would no doubt have done,\r\nand has given us so chaste and beautiful a realisation of the goddess.\r\nHaving regard to the scepticism with which this masterpiece was received\r\nin England at the time of its purchase for the nation it is worth\r\nquoting Senor Beruete's remarks upon it in that connection. \"The\r\nauthenticity of this work,\" he writes \"has found numerous doubters in\r\nSpain, less on account of its subject--being the only nude female figure\r\nin the whole _oeuvre_ of Velasquez--than because so few people ever\r\nsuspected its existence; but after it was exhibited at Manchester in\r\n1857 and in London in 1890, it was recognised that its attribution to\r\nVelasquez was well founded. At the sight of the canvas all doubt\r\nvanishes. There, indeed, is the style, the inimitable technique of\r\nVelasquez.\"\r\n\r\nThis, from the connoisseur who has devoted years of study to the work of\r\nthe master, and who rejects such well established examples as the\r\nDulwich _Philip IV._ and the _Admiral Pulido Pareja_, is surely more\r\nconclusive than the academic pedantry of ignorance masquerading as\r\nauthority.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nBARTOLOMÉ ESTÉBAN MURILLO (1617-1682) has always been accounted the most\r\npopular of the Spanish painters, and it is only in recent times that his\r\npopularity has faded into comparative insignificance on the fuller\r\nrecognition and understanding of the genius of Velasquez. The intensely\r\nAnglican feeling in this country during the eighteenth and nineteenth\r\ncenturies\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PLATE XIX.--VELAZQUEZ\r\n\r\nTHE ROKEBY VENUS\r\n\r\n_National Gallery, London_]\r\n\r\nseems to have found peculiar relief in the sentimental aspirations of\r\nthe followers of Raphael in the rendering of religious subjects from the\r\nRomish point of view. At the present time we are readier to estimate\r\nMurillo's justly high place in the annals of painting by such a picture\r\nas his own portrait, lent by Lord Spencer to the recent Exhibition, than\r\nto allow it on the strength of our recollection of the Madonnas and Holy\r\nFamilies, Immaculate Conceptions and Assumptions, of which there exist\r\nso many copies in the dining rooms of country rectories. The _Boy\r\nDrinking_, which is here reproduced, if it is the least \"important\" of\r\nthe four examples in the National Gallery, is certainly not the least\r\nexcellent.\r\n\r\nFrom the miserable state into which Spain had fallen by the end of the\r\nseventeenth century, it could hardly be expected that anything further\r\nin the nature of art would result, and it was not until towards the end\r\nof the eighteenth that another genius arose, in the person of FRANCISCO\r\nGOYA (1746-1828). Of this extraordinary phenomenon in the firmament of\r\nart it is impossible to say more than a very few words in this place.\r\nLike a meteor, he is rather to be pointed at than talked about, when\r\nthere are so many stars and planets whose regular courses have to be\r\nobserved and recorded. He was like a sharp knife drawn across the face\r\nof Spain, gashing it here and there, but for the most part just touching\r\nit lightly enough to sting and to leave a mark. As a Court painter he\r\nwas an unqualified success, his salary under Charles IV. rising in ten\r\nyears from 15,000 to 50,000 reals; but his official productions are not\r\nthe less devoid of interest on that account, and are sometimes the more\r\nsatirical from the necessity for concealment. In his more outspoken\r\nworks, such as the _Disasters of War_, and the series of prints called\r\n_Los Caprichos_ and _Tauromachia_, he is too brutal not to affect the\r\nordinary observer's judgment upon his artistic qualities. Velasquez\r\nhimself could scarcely stop short enough, when painting dwarfs and\r\nidiots and cripples, to let us admire his genius unhampered by shivers\r\nof repulsion. Goya, being exactly the opposite of Velasquez in\r\ntemperament, had no scruples about expressing the utmost of his subject;\r\nand even in decorating a church was reproved for \"falling short of the\r\nstandard of chastity\" required. But between the extremes of brutality\r\nand conventionalism there is such a wide expanse of pure joy of painting\r\nthat nothing can diminish the reputation of Goya, however much it is\r\nlikely to be enhanced. To the modern Spanish painter he is probably as\r\nfixed a beacon as Velasquez.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PLATE XX.--MURILLO\r\n\r\nA BOY DRINKING\r\n\r\n_National Gallery, London_]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_FLEMISH SCHOOL_\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI\r\n\r\nHUBERT AND JAN VAN EYCK\r\n\r\n\r\nIn 1383, on the death of Louis de Maele, his son-in-law Philip the\r\nHardy, Duke of Burgundy, assumed the government of Flanders. In the same\r\nyear Philip founded the Carthusian Convent at Dijon and employed a\r\nFlemish painter named Melchin Broederlam to embellish two great shrines\r\nwithin it. To the strong-handed policy of Philip and his successors\r\nduring the ensuing century may be attributed the rise of Netherlandish\r\nart which, though existing before their time, required their vigorous\r\nrepression of intestine feuds to give it an opportunity of developing.\r\nUnder Louis and his predecessors Flanders and its cities had risen to\r\ngreat commercial importance, but its rulers had neither the strength nor\r\nthe prestige to keep the turbulent spirit of their subjects in due\r\nbounds. The school of painting which now arose so rapidly to perfection\r\nunder the Dukes of Burgundy thus owed a portion of its progress to the\r\nwealth and independence of the commercial classes. The taste, power, and\r\ncultivation of a Court gave it an additional spur; and the clergy\r\nthrowing in their weight, added their support in aid of art.\r\n\r\nTwo wings of one of the Dijon shrines are still preserved in the museum\r\nthere, and in these Messrs Crowe and Cavalcaselle observe the\r\ncharacteristics of much that was to follow:--\"Although Melchior's style\r\nwas founded on the study of the painters of the Rhine, his composition\r\nwas similar to the later productions of the Flemish school. A tendency\r\nto realism already marks this early Fleming, and is the distinctive\r\nfeature of a manner in which the painter strives to imitate nature in\r\nits most material forms. Idealism and noble forms are lacking, but\r\nBroederlam is a fair imitator of the truth. Distinctive combination and\r\nchoice of colours in draperies, and vigorous tone, characterise him as\r\nthey do the early works at Bruges and other cities of the Netherlands\r\nwhich may be judged by his standard.\" And again, \"the painter evidently\r\nstruggled between the desire to give a material imitation, and the\r\ninspirations of graceful teachers like those of Cologne.... Penetrated\r\nwith similar ideas the early Flemings might under similar circumstances\r\nhave risen to a sweet and dignified conception of nature; and if we fail\r\nto discover that they attained this aim we must attribute the failure to\r\ncauses peculiar to Flanders. Amongst these we may class the social\r\nstatus of the Flemish painters, whose positions in the household of\r\nprinces subjected them perhaps to caprices unfavourable to the\r\ndevelopment of high aspirations, or the contemplation and free communion\r\nwith self which are the soul of art.\"\r\n\r\nIt is interesting to compare these observations, so far as they refer to\r\nthe realism which characterises Netherlandish painting, with those of Dr\r\nWaagen, who it will be seen explains it on the broader grounds of\r\nnational temperament. \"Early Netherlandish painting,\" he contends, \"in\r\nits freedom from all foreign influence, exhibits the contrast between\r\nthe natural feeling of the Greek and the German races respectively in\r\nthe department of art--these two races being the chief representatives\r\nof the cultivation of the ancient and the modern world. In this\r\ncircumstance consists the high significance of this school when\r\nconsidered in reference to the general history of art. While it is\r\ncharacteristic of the Greek feeling--from which was derived the\r\nItalian--to idealise,--and to idealise, be it observed, not only the\r\nconceptions of the ideal world but even such material objects as\r\nportraits,--by the simplification of forms and the prominence given to\r\nthe more important parts of a work of art, the early Netherlanders, on\r\nthe other hand, conferred a portrait-like character upon the most ideal\r\npersonifications of the Virgin, the Apostles, Prophets, and Martyrs, and\r\nin actual portraiture aimed at rendering even the most accidental\r\npeculiarities of nature, like warts and wrinkles, with excruciating\r\nfidelity.\r\n\r\n\"While the Greeks expressed the various features of outward nature--such\r\nas rivers, fountains, hills, trees, etc.--under abstract human forms,\r\nthe Netherlanders endeavoured to express them as they had seen them in\r\nnature, and with a truth which extended to the smallest details.\r\n\r\n\"In opposition to the ideal, and what may be called the personifying\r\ntendency of the Greeks, the Netherlanders developed a purely realistic\r\nand landscape school.\r\n\r\n\"In this respect the other Teutonic nations are found to approach them\r\nmost nearly, the Germans first, and then the English.\"\r\n\r\nBut whatever may have been the causes which produced the distinguishing\r\nfeatures of Netherlandish painting, we have still to enquire the origin\r\nfrom which the practice of painting in northern Europe proceeded. For\r\nin taking Melchior Broederlam as a starting-point we are only going as\r\nfar back--with the exception of certain rude wall paintings--as the\r\nearliest examples take us; and having seen how in Italy the whole\r\nhistory of the art is traceable to Cimabue, Duccio, and Giotto, through\r\nthe Byzantines, at least a century before Broederlam comes under our\r\nnotice, we might naturally conclude that it was from Italy that it\r\nspread to Cologne, and from Cologne to the Netherlands. So far as is\r\nknown, however, this was not the case, and we must look elsewhere than\r\nto Italy for the influences which formed this school. Nevertheless it\r\nwas a collateral branch of the same stock--Byzantine art--and the family\r\nresemblance comes out none the less strongly from the two branches\r\nhaving developed under different circumstances. In Italy, as we have\r\nseen, the Byzantine seed, sown in such fertile soil, attained suddenly a\r\ngreat luxuriance. In the north, transplanted by Charlemagne to\r\nAix-la-Chapelle in the ninth century, it grew slowly and more timidly,\r\nbut none the less surely, under the cover of Monasticism, in the\r\nmanuscripts illuminated with miniatures; and thus when it did burst\r\nforth into fuller blossom, the boldness of the Italian masters, who\r\nworked at large in fresco, was wanting, and a detailed and almost\r\nmeticulous realism was its chief characteristic. Another point worth\r\nnoticing is that though primarily introduced for religious purposes, as\r\nin Italy, namely the decoration of the cathedral erected by Charlemagne\r\nat Aix-la-Chapelle, the paintings in his palace showed forth events in\r\nhis own life, such as his campaigns in Spain, seiges of towns and feats\r\nof arms by Frankish warriors. At Upper Ingelheim, likewise, his chapel\r\nwas adorned with scenes from the Old and New Testaments, while the\r\nbanqueting hall exhibited on one wall the deeds of great Pagan rulers,\r\nsuch as Cyrus, Hannibal, and Alexander, and on the other those of\r\nConstantine and Theodosius, the seizure of Acquitaine by Pepin, and\r\nCharlemagne's own conquest over the Saxons and finally himself enthroned\r\nas conqueror. Although no trace remains of these paintings, contemporary\r\nmanuscripts executed by his order are still in existence in the\r\nlibraries of Paris, Trèves, and elsewhere from which we can form some\r\nidea of the style in which they were rendered and of the source from\r\nwhich they were derived.\r\n\r\nOf these we need only mention the Vulgate decorated by JOHN OF BRUGES,\r\npainter to King Charles V. of France, in 1371, which contains a portrait\r\nof the king in profile with a figure kneeling before him, and a few\r\nsmall historical subjects. From these it is evident that the art of\r\npainting, at any rate in little, had made considerable progress in the\r\nNetherlands at that date, and the express designation of _pictor_\r\napplied to John of Bruges, while the ordinary miniaturist was called\r\n_illuminator_, shows the probability of his having painted pictures on a\r\nlarger scale. The high development of realistic feeling as it first\r\nappears to us in the pictures of Hubert and Jan van Eyck is thus partly\r\naccounted for, especially when we also consider the wholesale\r\ndestruction of larger works of art that took place in the disturbed\r\ncondition of the Netherlands in the sixteenth century. The main points,\r\nhowever, to be borne in mind is that whereas Cimabue and Duccio started\r\npainting on walls under the influence of Byzantine teachers, Hubert van\r\nEyck, a century later, began painting on wooden panels under that of\r\nilluminators and painters in books.\r\n\r\nTo these, nevertheless, there must be added another scarcely less\r\nimportant, namely, that the early Italians were ignorant of the use of\r\nwhat we now call oil paints, and worked entirely in tempera--that is to\r\nsay, there was no admixture of oil or varnish with their pigments. To\r\nHubert van Eyck is attributed the invention of the modern practice, as\r\nVasari relates with more colour than historic truth in his life of\r\nAntonello da Messina, who is supposed to have carried it into Italy. Be\r\nthat as it may, the works of the van Eycks and their successors are all\r\nin oils, and there is no doubt that the employment of this medium from\r\nthe first considerably influenced the style, colour, and execution of\r\nall the works of this school.\r\n\r\nHUBERT VAN EYCK who according to the common acceptation was born in the\r\nyear 1366 at Maaseyck, a small town not far from Maestricht, must have\r\nbeen settled before the year 1412 in Bruges, when we hear of him as a\r\nmember of the Brotherhood of the Virgin with Rays.\r\n\r\nThere can be little doubt that Hubert van Eyck was acquainted with the\r\nwork of this John of Bruges, and that it had a considerable influence on\r\nhim. But while on the one hand he carried the realistic tendencies of\r\nsuch works to an extraordinary pitch of excellence, it is evident that\r\nin many essential respects he was actuated by a more ideal feeling and\r\nimparted to the realism of his contemporaries, by means of his far\r\nricher powers of representation, greater distinctness, truth to nature,\r\nand variety of expression. Throughout his works is seen an elevated and\r\nhighly energetic conception of the stern import of his labours in the\r\nservice of the Church.\r\n\r\nThe prevailing arrangement of his subjects is symmetrical, holding fast\r\nto the earliest rules of ecclesiastical art. His heads appear to aim at\r\nan ideal beauty and dignity only combined with actual truth to nature.\r\nHis draperies exhibit the purest taste and softness of folds, the\r\nrealistic principle being apparent in that greater attention to detail\r\nwhich a delicate indication of the material of the drapery necessitates.\r\nNude figures are studied from nature with the utmost fidelity; undraped\r\nportions of figures are also given with much truth, especially the\r\nhands. But what is the principal distinguishing characteristic of his\r\nart is the hitherto unprecedented power, depth, transparency and harmony\r\nof his colouring. Whatever want of exact truth there may be in the story\r\nas related by Vasari's story of the discovery of oil painting, there is\r\nno doubt that Hubert Van Eyck succeeded in preparing so transparent a\r\nvarnish that he could apply it without disadvantage to all colours.\r\n\r\nThe chief work by Hubert Van Eyck is the large altar-piece painted for\r\nthe cathedral of S. Bavon at Ghent;--parts of this have been removed and\r\nare now in the Berlin Gallery, and supplemented with excellent copies of\r\nthe rest, the whole of the wonderful composition may there be well\r\nstudied; a large photograph of the whole altar piece may also be seen in\r\nthe library at the Victoria and Albert Museum, which shows how the work\r\nwas originally designed. It was painted for Jodocus Vyts, Burgomaster of\r\nGhent, and his wife Elizabeth, for their mortuary chapel in the\r\ncathedral.\r\n\r\nThe subject of the three central panels of the upper portion is the\r\nDeity seated between _the Virgin and S. John the Baptist_. Underneath\r\nthese, of the same width, is the famous _Adoration of the Lamb_. These\r\ntogether formed the back of the altar-piece, and were covered by wings\r\nwhich opened out on hinges on either side.\r\n\r\nThe three large figures of the upper part are designed with all the\r\ndignity and statuesque repose belonging to an earlier style, and they\r\nare painted on a ground of gold and tapestry, as was constantly the\r\npractice in earlier times: but united with the traditional type we\r\nalready find a successful representation of life and nature in all their\r\ntruth. They stand as it were on the frontier of two different styles,\r\nand from the excellence of both form a wonderful and most impressive\r\nwhole. The Heavenly Father sits directly fronting the spectator, in all\r\nthe solemnity of ancient dignity, His right hand raised to give the\r\nbenediction to the Lamb and to all the multitude of figures below; in\r\nHis left hand is a crystal sceptre; on His head the triple crown, the\r\nemblem of the Trinity. The features are such as are ascribed to Christ\r\nby the traditions of the Church, but noble and well proportioned; the\r\nexpression is forcible, though passionless.\r\n\r\nThe tunic and the mantle of this figure are of a deep red, the latter\r\nbeing fastened over the breast by a clasp, and falling down in ample\r\nfolds over the feet. Behind, as high as the head, is a hanging of green\r\ntapestry which is ornamented with a golden pelican--a symbol of the\r\nRedeemer. Behind the head the ground is gold, and on it in a semicircle\r\nare three inscriptions describing the Trinity as almighty, all-good, and\r\nall-bountiful. The figures of S. John and of the Virgin display equal\r\nmajesty; both are reading holy books, as they turn towards the centre\r\nfigure. The countenance of S. John expresses ascetic seriousness, but in\r\nthat of the Virgin we find a serene grace and a purity of form which\r\napproach very nearly to the happier effects of Italian art.\r\n\r\nThe arrangement of the lower central picture, the worship of the Lamb,\r\nis strictly symmetrical, as the mystic nature of the allegorical subject\r\nmight seem to\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PLATE XXI.--JAN VAN EYCK\r\n\r\nJAN ARNOLFINI AND HIS WIFE\r\n\r\n_National Gallery, London_]\r\n\r\nhave demanded; but there is such beauty in the landscape, in the pure\r\natmosphere, in the bright green of the grass, in the masses of trees and\r\nflowers--even in single figures which stand out from the four principal\r\ngroups--that we no longer perceive either hardness or severity in this\r\nsymmetry.\r\n\r\nThe landscape of this composition and that part of it containing the\r\npatriarchs and prophets are generally supposed to have been completed by\r\nJAN VAN EYCK (_c._ 1385-1441), whose name till within a comparatively\r\nrecent period had almost obscured that of Hubert. For although there is\r\nlittle doubt that the elder brother was the first to develop the new\r\nmethod of painting, yet the fame of it did not extend beyond Belgium and\r\nacross the Alps until after the death of Hubert, when the celebrity it\r\nso speedily acquired throughout Europe was transferred to Jan Van Eyck.\r\nWithin fifteen years after his death, 1455, Jan was commemorated in\r\nItaly as the greatest painter of the century, while the name of Hubert\r\nwas not even mentioned. It was Jan van Eyck to whom Antonello da Messina\r\nis said by Vasari to have resorted in Bruges in order to learn the new\r\nstyle of painting; he alone also is mentioned in Vasari's first edition\r\nof 1550, Hubert not until the second edition in 1568, and then only\r\nincidentally.\r\n\r\nFortunately there are in existence various authentic pictures by Jan Van\r\nEyck in which his original powers are more easily recognised than in the\r\npart he took in the execution of the great altar-piece at Ghent, in\r\nwhich he doubtless accommodated himself with proper fraternal piety both\r\nto the composition and to the style of his elder brother--who was also\r\nhis master. In these we can see that he possessed neither the enthusiasm\r\nfor the rich imagery and symbolism of the ecclesiastical art of the\r\nMiddle Ages, nor that feeling for beauty in human forms or in drapery\r\nwhich belonged to his elder brother. His feeling, on the other hand, led\r\nhim to the closest and truest conception of individual nature. Where he\r\nhad to paint portraits only--a task which was most congenial to the\r\ntendency of his mind--he attained a life-like truth of form and\r\ncolouring in every part, extending even to the minutest details, such as\r\nno other artist of his time could rival, and which art in general has\r\nseldom produced. In his actual brush work he shows greater facility than\r\nwas ever attained by Hubert, by which he was enabled to render the\r\nmaterial of every substance with marvellous fidelity.\r\n\r\nWhat little we know of the personal history of Jan Van Eyck is of\r\nexceptional interest, inasmuch as we find him employed on diplomatic\r\nerrands to foreign countries, like his great successor Rubens; and as it\r\nhappens he landed in England, though not intentionally, in the course of\r\none of these voyages, being driven into Shoreham and Falmouth by adverse\r\nweather. It was in 1425 that he was taken into the service of Philip\r\nIII., Duke of Burgundy, as painter and \"varlet de chambre,\" shortly\r\nafter which he went to Lille. In the following year he was sent on a\r\npilgrimage as the Duke's proxy, and again on two secret missions. In\r\n1428 he went with the Duke's Embassy to the King of Portugal which was\r\nto sue for the hand of Isabella, the Portuguese princess. It was on this\r\noccasion that he was driven on to our shores. Arriving at Lisbon he\r\npainted two portraits of Isabella, one of which was sent home by sea and\r\nthe other overland. After a happy and successful career he died in 1441\r\nat Bruges, where he had married and settled down on his return from\r\nPortugal.\r\n\r\nThe most beautiful example of Jan Van Eyck's work in England is the\r\nportrait of Jean Arnolfini and Jeanne de Chenany his wife, now in the\r\nNational Gallery (No. 186). This is dated with the charming inscription,\r\n\"Johannes de Eyck fuit hic 1434\"--that is to say, instead of simply\r\nsigning the picture, he writes, \"Jan Van Eyck was here, 1434.\" No other\r\npicture shows so high a development of the master's extraordinary power\r\nand charm. Besides every other quality peculiar to him, we observe here\r\na perfection of tone and of chiaroscuro which no other specimen of this\r\nwhole period affords. It is recorded that Princess Mary, sister of\r\nCharles V. and Governess of the Netherlands, purchased this picture from\r\na barber to whom it belonged at the price of a post worth a hundred\r\ngulden a year. Among its subsequent possessors were Don Diego de\r\nGuevara, majordomo of Joan, Queen of Castile, by whom it was presented\r\nto Margaret of Austria. In 1530 it was acquired by Mary of Hungary, and\r\nlater it returned to Spain. In 1789 it was in the palace at Madrid, and\r\nsoon after it was taken by one of the French Generals, in whose quarters\r\nMajor-General Hay found it after the battle of Waterloo.\r\n\r\nTwo other portraits in the National Gallery bear the signature of Jan\r\nVan Eyck. No. 222, An elderly man, head and shoulders, on the frame of\r\nwhich is the painter's motto, \"als ich can,\" and his signature,\r\n\"Johannes de Eyck me fecit anno 1433, 21 Octobris.\" The other, No. 290,\r\nis a younger man, half length, standing inside an open window, on the\r\nsill of which is inscribed \"[Greek: Timotheos],\" and \"Léal Souvenir,\"\r\nand below the date and signature, \"Actum anno domini 1432, 10 die\r\nOctobris a Iohanne de Eyck.\"\r\n\r\nAmong the Netherlandish scholars and followers of the Van Eycks of whom\r\nany record has been preserved some appear to have been gifted with\r\nconsiderable powers, though none attained the excellence of their great\r\nprecursors. Although a number of works representing this school still\r\nexist in the various countries of Europe, yet compared with the actual\r\nabundance of them at one time they constitute but a scanty remnant.\r\n\r\nThough not actually a pupil of Jan Van Eyck, ROGER VAN DER WEYDEN\r\nacquired after him the greatest celebrity. As early as 1436 he filled\r\nthe honourable post of official painter to the city of Brussels. The\r\nchief work executed by him in this capacity was an altar-piece for the\r\nChamber of Justice in Hôtel de Ville. According to the custom of the\r\ntime, it set forth in the most realistic fashion examples of stern\r\nobservance of the law for the admonition of those placed in authority.\r\nThe principal picture showed how Herkenbald, a judge in the eleventh\r\ncentury, executed his own nephew (convicted of a grave crime, but who\r\nwould otherwise have escaped the penalty of the law) with his own hands;\r\nand how the sacramental wafer which, on the plea of murder, was denied\r\nto him by the priest, reached the lips of the upright judge by means of\r\na miracle. The wings contained an example of the justice of the Emperor\r\nTrajan. These pictures are unfortunately no longer in existence, having\r\nprobably been burned when Brussels was besieged in 1695.\r\n\r\nIn the Museum of the Hospital at Beaune is one of the most important of\r\nhis works still in existence, _The Last Judgment_, though in this it is\r\ngenerally supposed he was assisted by Dirk Bouts and Hans Memling. It\r\ncontains several portraits, notably those of the Pope, Eugenius IV., who\r\nstands behind the Apostles in the right wing, and next to him Philip the\r\nGood. The crowned female in the opposite wing is probably Philip's\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PLATE XXII.--JAN VAN EYCK\r\n\r\nPORTRAIT OF THE PAINTER'S WIFE\r\n\r\n_Town Gallery, Bruges_]\r\n\r\nsecond wife, Isabella of Portugal, whose portrait Jan Van Eyck went to\r\nLisbon to paint before her marriage. On the outer sides are excellently\r\npainted portraits of the founder of the Hospital, Nicolas Rolin, and his\r\nwife. This work has been classed with the Van Eycks' _Adoration of the\r\nLamb_, and the _Adoration of the Shepherds_ by Hugo Van der Goes, as\r\ncrystallizing the finest expression of early northern painting.\r\n\r\nIn 1450 he visited Italy, where he painted the beautiful little\r\naltar-piece which is now in the Städel Institute at Frankfort, for Piero\r\nand Giovanni de'Medici.\r\n\r\nAnother very fine example of his work is the triptych, now in the Berlin\r\nMuseum, executed for Pierre Bladelin. In the centre is the Nativity,\r\nwith a portrait of Bladelin kneeling, and angels. On the one side is the\r\nannunciation of the Redeemer to the ruler of the West--the Emperor\r\nAugustus--by the agency of the Tiburtine Sibyl; on the other to those of\r\nthe East--the Three Kings--who are keeping watch on a mountain, where\r\nthe child appears to them in a star.\r\n\r\nOne of the largest as well as of the finest of the master's works is a\r\ntriptych in the Munich Gallery--the _Adoration of the Kings_, with the\r\n_Annunciation_ and the _Presentation in the Temple_ in the wings. The\r\nfigure of the Virgin in the _Presentation_ is particularly pleasing for\r\nits simple and unaffected realism. _S. Luke painting the Virgin_, also\r\nin the Munich Gallery, is ascribed to Roger.\r\n\r\nNo painter of this school, the Van Eycks even not excepted, exercised so\r\ngreat and widely extended an influence as Roger Van der Weyden. Not only\r\nwere Hans Memling--the greatest master of the next generation in\r\nBelgium--and his own son, also named Roger, his pupils, but innumerable\r\nworks other than pictures were produced, such as miniatures,\r\nblock-books, and engravings, in which his form of art is recognisable.\r\nIt was under his auspices that the realistic tendency of the Van Eycks\r\npervaded all Germany; for it was only after the death of Jan Van Eyck,\r\nin 1441, that the widespread fame of Roger Van der Weyden induced\r\nGermans to visit his studio at Brussels. Martin Schongauer, one of the\r\ngreatest German masters of the sixteenth century, is known to have been\r\nhis pupil, and it is certain that there must have been many others.\r\n\r\nIt is in HANS MEMLING (_c._ 1435-1494), whom Vasari states to have been\r\nthe pupil of Roger, that the early Netherlandish School attains the\r\nhighest delicacy of artistic development. His poetical and profoundly\r\nhuman qualities had a special attraction for the \"Pre-Raphaelite\r\nBrotherhood\" inaugurated by Rossetti and Holman Hunt in the middle of\r\nthe nineteenth century. This unusual tenderness of feeling is probably\r\nalso the origin of the legend that Memling was taken into the Hospital\r\nof S. John at Bruges--where he painted most of his masterpieces--as a\r\nsick soldier after the battle of Nancy. In feeling for beauty and grace\r\nhe was more gifted than any painter except Hubert Van Eyck, and this\r\nquality, conspicuous amid the somewhat ugly realism of most of his\r\ncontemporaries, has ensured him perhaps a little more popularity than is\r\nrightly his share. Compared with the works of his master, Roger Van der\r\nWeyden, his figures are certainly of better proportions and less\r\nmeagreness of form; his hands and feet truer to nature; the heads of his\r\nwomen are sweeter, and those of his men less severe. His outlines are\r\nsofter, and in the modelling of his flesh parts more delicacy of half\r\ntones is observable. His colours are still more luminous and\r\ntransparent. On the other hand he is inferior to Van der Weyden in the\r\ncarrying out of detail, such as the materials of his draperies or the\r\nrendering of the full brilliancy of gold.\r\n\r\nIn 1467 Memling was a master painter at Bruges, and painted the portrait\r\nof the medallist, Nicolas Spinelli, which is now in the Royal Museum at\r\nAntwerp, and a small altar-piece now at Chatsworth. His most famous\r\nworks, those in the Hospital at Bruges, belong to a somewhat later date,\r\nthe _Shrine of S. Ursula_ not being completed till 1489. The _Adoration\r\nof the Kings_ and the altar-piece were some ten years earlier. The\r\nfamous shrine of S. Ursula is about four feet in length, and the whole\r\nof the outside is adorned with painting. On each side of the cover are\r\nthree medallions, a large one in the centre and two smaller at the\r\nsides. The latter contain angels playing on musical instruments; in the\r\ncentre on one side is a Coronation of the Virgin, on the other the\r\nGlorification of S. Ursula and her companions, with two figures of\r\nBishops. On the gable-ends are the Virgin and Child with two sisters of\r\nthe hospital kneeling before them, and S. Ursula with the arrow, the\r\ninstrument of her martyrdom, and virgins seeking protection under her\r\nmantle. On the longer sides of the reliquary itself, in six rather\r\nlarger compartments, is painted the history of S. Ursula.\r\n\r\nOf about the same period, possibly a little earlier, is the _Marriage of\r\nS. Catherine_, which is also in S. John's Hospital at Bruges. The\r\ncentral figure is that of the Virgin, seated under a porch, with\r\ntapestry hanging down behind it; two angels hold a crown over her head:\r\nbeside her is S. Catherine kneeling, whose head is one of the finest\r\never painted by Memling. Behind her is an angel playing on the organ,\r\nand further back S. John the Baptist. On the other side kneels S.\r\nBarbara, reading: behind her another angel holds a book to the Virgin,\r\nand still further back is S. John the Evangelist, a figure of great\r\nbeauty, and of a singularly mild and thoughtful character. Through the\r\narcades of the porch we look out, on either side of the throne, on a\r\nrich landscape, in which are represented scenes from the lives of the\r\ntwo S. Johns. The panel on the right contains the beheading of the\r\nBaptist, on the left the Evangelist in the Isle of Patmos, where the\r\nvision of the Apocalypse appears to him--the Almighty on a throne in a\r\nglory of dazzling light, encompassed with a rainbow.\r\n\r\nThe whole forms a work strikingly poetical and most impressive in\r\ncharacter; it is highly finished, both in drawing and composition.\r\n\r\nIAN GOSSAERT (_c._ 1472-1535), called JAN VAN MABUSE from his native\r\ntown of Maubeuge, was the son of a bookbinder who worked for the Abbey\r\nof Sainte-Aldegonde. It is possible therefore that he might have formed\r\nan early acquaintance with illuminated manuscripts before studying the\r\nart of painting in the studio of a master. Memling, Gerard, David, and\r\nQuentin Massys have been suggested as his instructors, but it is not\r\nknown for certain that he was actually a pupil of any of them. In 1508\r\nhe went to Italy, where he appears to have been greatly influenced both\r\nby the work of the Renaissance painters and by the antique. The\r\n_Adoration of the Kings_, which was lately purchased from Castle Howard\r\nfor the National Gallery for £40,000, was painted before he went to\r\nItaly.\r\n\r\nTowards the end of the fifteenth century, in consequence of the transfer\r\nof commerce from Bruges to Antwerp, this latter city first became and\r\nlong continued the centre of art, and especially of Netherlandish\r\npainting. Here it is that we find QUENTIN MASSYS, the greatest Belgian\r\npainter of this later time. He was born\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PLATE XXIII.--JAN MABUSE\r\n\r\nPORTRAIT OF JEAN CARONDELET\r\n\r\n_Louvre, Paris_]\r\n\r\nprobably in 1466. His father is said to have been a blacksmith and\r\nclockmaker, and there is a tradition that Quentin only forsook the\r\nhammer for the brush at instigation of a tender passion for a beautiful\r\nlady. Be that as it may, he is an important figure in the history of\r\nBelgian art. He distinguishes, broadly speaking, the close of the last\r\nperiod and the beginning of the next. A number of pictures representing\r\nsacred subjects exhibit, with little feeling for real beauty of form,\r\nsuch delicacy of features, beauty and earnestness of feeling, tenderness\r\nand clearness of colouring and skill in finish, as worthily recall the\r\nreligious painting of the Middle Ages, though at the very end of them.\r\nIn his draperies, especially, we observe a charm which is peculiar to\r\nMassys. At the same time, in the subordinate figures introduced into\r\nsacred subjects, such as the executioners, etc., he seems to take\r\npleasure in coarse and tasteless caricatures.\r\n\r\nIn subjects taken from common life, such as money changers, loving\r\ncouples, or ugly old women, he uses his brush with evident zest, and\r\nwith great success. The pictures of his later period are also\r\ndistinguished from those of other painters by the large size of the\r\nfigures, which for the first time in his country are of three-quarters\r\nor even actual life size.\r\n\r\nAmong his most original and attractive pictures are the half-length\r\nfigures of Christ and the Virgin. These must have been very popular in\r\nhis own time, for he has left several repetitions of them. Two heads of\r\nthis class are at Antwerp, and two others of equal beauty are in the\r\nNational Gallery in one frame (No. 295).\r\n\r\nThe most celebrated of his subject pictures is that known by the name of\r\n_The Misers_, or _The Money Changers_, at Windsor Castle--of which there\r\nare numerous copies, and this is not supposed to be the original. _The\r\nMoney Changer and His Wife_ at the Louvre is undoubtedly his.\r\n\r\nLUCAS VAN LEYDEN, as he was called (his real name being Luc Jacobez),\r\nwas born in 1494, and died in 1533. He was a pupil of a little known\r\nartist, Cornelis Engelbrechstein, who was a follower if not a pupil of\r\nMemling. Lucas was an artist of multifarious powers and very early\r\ndevelopment. He painted admirably--though his authenticated works are\r\nvery scarce--drew, and engraved. He pursued the path of realism in the\r\ntreatment of sacred subjects, but with less beauty or elevation of mind.\r\nHis heads are generally of a very ugly character. At the same time his\r\nform of expression found sympathy in the feeling of the period, and by\r\nthe skill with which it was expressed, especially in his engravings,\r\nattracted a number of followers. In scenes from common life he is full\r\nof truth and delicate observation of nature, though showing now and then\r\na somewhat coarse sense of humour. One of his most important works is a\r\nlarge composition of _The Last Judgment_, which is at Leyden.\r\n\r\nVery early in the sixteenth century--beginning in fact, as we have seen,\r\nwith Jan Mabuse in 1508--the Netherlandish and German artists made it\r\nthe fashion to repair to Italy, attracted by the reputation of the great\r\nmasters; so that from this time onwards their work ceases to exhibit the\r\npurely northern characteristics of their predecessors. For it appears\r\nthat precisely those qualities most opposed to their own native feeling\r\nfor art made the deepest impression on their minds; more especially such\r\ngeneral qualities as grandeur, beauty, simplicity of forms, drawing of\r\nthe nude, unrestrained freedom, boldness, and grace of movement--in\r\nshort, all that is comprised in art under the term \"ideal.\"\r\n\r\nBut the attempt to appropriate all these qualities could lead to no\r\nsuccessful result. Being based on no inherent want on the part of their\r\nown original feeling for art, it became only the outward imitation of\r\nsomething foreign to themselves, and they never therefore succeeded in\r\nmastering the complete understanding of form, or in adopting the true\r\nfeeling for beauty of line or grace of movement; and in aiming at them\r\nthey only degenerated into artificiality, exaggeration in drawing, and\r\nviolence in attitude. The pictures of this class, even of religious\r\nsubjects, have accordingly but little to attract the eye, and when they\r\nselected scenes from ancient mythology, and allegories decked out with\r\nan ostentation of learning, the result is positively disagreeable.\r\n\r\nThe most satisfactory productions of this period will be found in the\r\ndepartment of portrait painting, which, by its nature, threw the artist\r\nupon the exercise of his own original feeling for art. As in every other\r\nrespect this epoch is far more important as a link in the chain of\r\nhistory than from any pleasure arising from its own works, it will be\r\nsufficient to mention only the more important painters and a few of\r\ntheir principal pictures.\r\n\r\nThe first painter who deserted his native style of art was, as before\r\nmentioned, Jan Mabuse. After the large _Adoration of the Kings_ in the\r\nNational Gallery the most important picture of his pre-Italian period is\r\nthe _Christ in the Garden of Gethsemane_ at Berlin. Nearly all his works\r\nsubsequent to 1512, by which time he had settled in Brussels, are\r\ncharacterised by all the faults above mentioned. Their redeeming quality\r\nis their masterly treatment. Among those of religious subjects the\r\nsmallest are as a rule the best. The _Ecce Homo_ at Antwerp, so\r\nfrequently copied by contemporary painters, is a specimen of masterly\r\nmodelling and vigorous colour. He is less successful with his life-size\r\n_Adam and Eve_, of which there are repetitions at Brussels, Hatfield,\r\nHampton Court and Berlin. But his most unpleasing efforts are the\r\nmythological subjects such as the _Danaë_ at Munich, and the _Neptune\r\nand Amphitrite_ at Berlin. On the other hand, his portraits are\r\nattractive both from being more original, and less influenced by his\r\nacquired mannerisms of style Four of these are in the National Gallery,\r\nand the _Girl weighing Gold Pieces_, in the Berlin gallery, is also\r\nworthy of mention.\r\n\r\nBERNARD VAN ORLEY, born at Brussels in 1471, is characterised in the\r\ncatalogue of the National Gallery as \"taking his place after Massys and\r\nMabuse on the downward slope of Netherlandish painting.\" He has been\r\nimmortalised by the fine portrait head of him by Albert Dürer which is\r\nnow in the Dresden Gallery. He was Court painter to Margaret of Austria,\r\nGoverness of the Low Countries, and retained the same post under her\r\nsuccessor, Mary of Hungary. He is said to have visited Rome in 1509, and\r\nthere made the acquaintance of Raphael, whose influence is certainly\r\napparent, though hardly his inspiration, in the _Holy Family_ in the\r\nLouvre. A more Netherlandish work, both in feeling and in treatment, is\r\nthe _Pietà_ in the Gallery at Brussels.\r\n\r\nIAN SCOREL, born in 1495, was a pupil of Mabuse, and appears to have\r\nbeen the first to introduce the Italian style into his native\r\ncountry--Holland. When on a pilgrimage to Palestine he happened to pass\r\nthrough Rome at the time his countryman was raised to the papal dignity\r\nas Adrian VI., and after painting his portrait he was appointed overseer\r\nof the art treasures of the Vatican. Returning to Utrecht, where he\r\ndied, he painted the picture of the _Virgin and Child_, with donors,\r\nwhich is now in the Town Hall.\r\n\r\nA fine portrait by Scorel of Cornelius Aerntz van der Dussen is in the\r\nBerlin Gallery.\r\n\r\nThe decided and strongly realistic style in which Quentin Massys had\r\npainted scenes from common life, as for instance the Misere or Money\r\nChangers, became the model for various painters in their treatment of\r\nsimilar subjects. First among these was his son, JAN MASSYS, born about\r\n1500, who followed closely but rather clumsily in his father's\r\nfootsteps, and need only be mentioned for carrying on the tradition.\r\nMore interesting were the Breughels, namely, PIETER BREUGHEL the elder,\r\nborn about 1520, called Peasant Breughel, and his two sons Pieter and\r\nJan. Old Breughel is best studied at Vienna, where there are good\r\nexamples of his various subjects, notably a _Crucifixion_ and _The Tower\r\nof Babel_--both dated 1563--and secular scenes like _A Peasant Wedding_\r\nand a _Fight between Carnival and Lent_, which are full of clever and\r\ndroll invention.\r\n\r\nHis elder son, Pieter, was called Hell Breughel, from his choice of\r\nsubject. He is far inferior to his father or to his younger brother Jan,\r\ncalled Velvet Breughel, born in 1568. Though more especially a landscape\r\npainter, Jan also takes an important place in the development of subject\r\npictures, which, though seldom rising above a somewhat coarse reality,\r\nare of a lively character, and worthy forerunners of the more\r\naccomplished productions of Teniers, Ostade, and Brouwer.\r\n\r\nIt is in portrait painting, however, that the Netherlandish School\r\nchiefly distinguished itself during its decline in the seventeenth\r\ncentury, and had all its sons remained in the country to enhance its\r\nglory, it is probable that the effect on the general practice of\r\npainting would have been more than beneficial. But portrait painters\r\nhave not always been content to sit at home and wait for sitters to come\r\nto them, especially when the state of society in which they happen to\r\nfind themselves makes waiting rather a long and tedious process. From\r\nthe Reformation onwards, for over two centuries, there was a steady\r\ndemand for portrait painters in England, and after the foundation of a\r\nreally English school of painting by Reynolds in the middle of the\r\neighteenth century, the stream of foreign, especially Netherlandish,\r\ntalent never entirely ceased to flow. But confining ourselves for the\r\npresent to the sixteenth century, we find that all the considerable\r\nNetherlandish portrait painters were employed for the most part outside\r\ntheir own country.\r\n\r\nTypical of these is JOOS VAN CLEEF, of Antwerp, who died in 1540.\r\nAccording to Vasari he visited Spain and painted portraits for the Court\r\nof France. At all events it is certain that he worked for a time in\r\nEngland, where the great success of Sir Antonio Mor is said to have\r\ndisordered his brain. The few pictures that can be assigned to him with\r\nany certainty thoroughly justify the high reputation he enjoyed in his\r\ntime--the two male portraits for example at Berlin and Munich, the\r\nportraits of himself and his wife at Windsor, and his own at Althorp.\r\nHis style may be classed as between that of Holbein and Antonio Mor. His\r\nwell-drawn forms are decided without being hard, and his warm and\r\ntransparent colouring recalls the great masters of the Venetian School.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nII\r\n\r\nPETER PAUL RUBENS\r\n\r\n\r\nDr Waagen thus summarises the history of painting in the Netherlands\r\nduring the interval of about a century and a half that elapsed between\r\nthe death of Jan van Eyck in 1440 and the birth of PETER PAUL RUBENS in\r\n1577.\r\n\r\n\"The great school of the brothers van Eyck,\" he writes, \"which united\r\nwith a profound and genuine enthusiasm for religious subjects a pure and\r\nhealthy feeling for nature, and a talent for portraying her minutest\r\ndetails with truth and fidelity, had continued till the end of the\r\nfifteenth century, and in some instances even later, to produce the most\r\nadmirable works, combining the utmost technical perfection in touch and\r\nfinish with most vivid and beautiful colouring. To this original school,\r\nhowever, had succeeded a perverted rage for imitating the Italian\r\nmasters, which had been introduced into the Netherlands by a few\r\npainters of talent, particularly by Jean Mabuse and Bernard van Orley.\r\nTo display their science by throwing their figures into forced and\r\ndifficult positions and strongly marking the muscles, by which they\r\nthought to emulate the grandeur of Michel Angelo, and to exhibit their\r\nlearning by the choice of mythological and allegorical subjects, became\r\nthe aim of succeeding painters, and before these false and artificial\r\nviews of art, the spirit of religious enthusiasm and the pure, naïve\r\nperception of the truth and beauty of nature gradually disappeared.\r\n\r\n\"In proportion as the Flemish painters lost the proper conception of\r\nform, and the feeling for delicacy and beauty of outline, it followed\r\nof course that they became more and more removed from nature in their\r\ndesire to rival each other in the forced attitudes of their figures, and\r\nin the exhibition of nudity, until at last such disgusting caricatures\r\nwere produced as we find in the works of Martin Heemskirk or Franz\r\nFloris, artists who were even deficient in good colouring, the old\r\ninheritance of the school.\r\n\r\n\"Some few painters, however, whose feeling for truth and nature repelled\r\nthem instinctively from a path so far removed from both, took to\r\nportraying scenes of real life with considerable humour and vivacity; or\r\nthey delineated nature in her commonest aspects with great minuteness of\r\ndetail; and thus _tableaux de genre_ and landscape originated. Although\r\na few isolated efforts to introduce a better state of things were\r\nvisible towards the end of the sixteenth century, it was reserved for a\r\nmind of no common power to bring about a complete revolution.\"\r\n\r\nThat Rubens was possessed of a \"mind of no common power\" will be readily\r\nadmitted. He was an extraordinary person, in whom were combined such a\r\nvariety of excellent qualities that there seems to have been no room\r\nleft in him for any of the inferior ones which are usually necessary, as\r\none must almost admit, for an alloy that will harden the finer metal for\r\nthe practical purposes of success. With all his feeling for religion, he\r\nwas seldom prudish; his amazing vitality never led him into excess or\r\nintemperance. His intense patriotism was all for peace; classical\r\nlearning never made him dry or bumptious, nor the favour of kings\r\nservile. As fine a gentleman as Buckingham, he had no enemies.\r\n\r\nSomething more than temperament and natural ability, however, was\r\nnecessary to make Rubens exactly what he turned out to be, and that was\r\nenvironment. Had he remained in Flanders all his life we should have\r\nbeen deprived of much that is most characteristic in his art. He was too\r\nbig, that is to say, for the flower pot. He needed to be bedded out, so\r\nthat his exuberant natural genius might have the proper opportunities\r\nfor expanding under suitable conditions. It was in Venice and Mantua, in\r\nFlorence and Rome that he found himself, and took his measure from the\r\ngiants.\r\n\r\nRubens was born in 1577 at Cologne, where his father, a jurist of\r\nconsiderable attainments, had taken refuge from the disturbances at\r\nAntwerp in 1566. He was christened Peter Paul in honour of the saints on\r\nwhose festival his birthday fell--29th June. At the age of sixteen he\r\nwas placed as a page in the household of the widowed Countess of\r\nLalaing, but as he showed a remarkable love for drawing he was\r\napprenticed first to Tobias Verhaegt, a landscape painter, and then to\r\nAdam Van Oort. The latter was so unsuitable a master, however, that\r\nRubens was soon committed to the care of Otto Vennius, at that time\r\nCourt painter to the Infanta Isabella and the Archduke Albert, her\r\nhusband; he prospered so well that in 1600 Vennius advised him to go to\r\nItaly to finish his education as a painter.\r\n\r\nRubens was now in his twenty-third year, and besides being proficient in\r\npainting he was so well grounded in the classics and in general\r\neducation and manners that he was recommended by the Archduke to\r\nVincenzio, Duke of Gonzaga, whose palace at Mantua was famous for\r\ncontaining an immense collection of art treasures, a great part of which\r\nwithin the next quarter of a century were purchased by King Charles, the\r\nDuke of Buckingham, and the Earl of Arundel. The influence exerted on\r\nthe young painter by surroundings like these is exemplified in a note by\r\nWaagen:--\r\n\r\n\"Rubens during his residence at Mantua was so pleased with the _Triumph\r\nof Julius Cæsar_ by Mantegna (the large cartoons now at Hampton Court\r\nPalace), that he made a free copy of one of them. His love for the\r\nfantastic and pompous led him to choose that with the elephants carrying\r\nthe candelabra; but his ardent imagination, ever directed to the\r\ndramatic, could not be contented with this. Instead of a harmless sheep,\r\nwhich, in Mantegna, is walking by the side of the foremost elephant,\r\nRubens has introduced a lion and a lioness, which growl angrily at the\r\nelephant. The latter is looking furiously round, and is on the point of\r\nstriking the lion a blow with his trunk.\"\r\n\r\nThat Rubens should have been so specially attracted by Mantegna may seem\r\na little surprising, until we remember that both were lovers and\r\nstudents of classical antiquities--a fact that is often forgotten in\r\nrecalling only the principal achievements of either. But it is important\r\nto know what sort of foundations underlie the most splendid erections if\r\nwe wish to understand how they came into existence and what their place\r\nis in the history of the arts. A glance through Lemprière's _Dictionary_\r\nmay furnish a modern Academician with a subject for a popular\r\npicture,--but that is stucco rather than foundation. The roots of tall\r\ntrees go deep. Rubens when he was in Rome studied the antiquities of the\r\nplace with the utmost diligence and zeal, as is evidenced by a book\r\npublished by his brother Philip in 1608.\r\n\r\nIt was in the autumn of this year that he received the news, when at\r\nGenoa, of his mother's illness, which induced him to return to Antwerp\r\nforthwith. On his arrival he found she had died before the messenger\r\nhad reached Genoa.\r\n\r\nAfter four months of mourning he was ready to return to Flanders; his\r\nsojourn of eight years in Italy had so far influenced him that he might\r\nhave remained there indefinitely had it not been for the Archduke and\r\nthe Infanta pressing him to remain at Brussels and attach himself to\r\ntheir Court. Another circumstance may possibly have weighed with him;\r\nfor within a year we find him married to Elizabeth Brant, the daughter\r\nof a magistrate of Antwerp, and it was not at Brussels, but at Antwerp,\r\nthat he took up his quarters. Here he proceeded to build a wonderful\r\nhouse--said to have cost him 60,000 florins--after designs of his own in\r\nthe Italian style, which he filled with the treasures he had collected\r\nin Italy.\r\n\r\nRubens's first pictures were nearly all of them religious subjects.\r\nBefore he went to Italy he had painted an _Adoration of the Kings_, a\r\n_Holy Trinity_, and the _Dead Christ in the Arms of God the Father_,\r\nwhich was engraved by Bolswert. When Vincenzio sent him to Rome to copy\r\npictures there for him, he found time to execute a commission which he\r\nreceived from the Archduke Albert to paint three pictures for the Church\r\nof Santa Croce di Gerusalamme, namely, the _Crowning with Thorns_, the\r\n_Crucifixion_, and the _Finding of the Cross_. A year later--after\r\nreturning from a journey to Madrid--he painted the altar-piece for the\r\nChurch of Santa Maria in Vallicella, in which the influence of Paul\r\nVeronese is conspicuous. At Genoa, he painted the Circumcision and S.\r\nIgnatius for the church of the Jesuits.\r\n\r\nOne of the first pictures which he painted on his return to Antwerp was\r\nan altar-piece for the private chapel of the Archduke Albert, of the\r\nHoly Family. This picture was so much admired that the members of the\r\nfraternity of S. Ildefonso, at the head of which was the Archduke\r\nAlbert, commissioned him to paint an altar-piece for the Chapel of the\r\nOrder of S. James near Brussels. This picture, which is now at Vienna,\r\nrepresents the Virgin enthroned, surrounded by four female saints,\r\nputting the Cloak of the Order on the shoulders of S. Ildefonso. On the\r\nwings are the portraits of the Archduke and Isabella, with their patron\r\nsaints.\r\n\r\nThus we find that, like the earliest painters in his own country as well\r\nas in Italy, the beginning of Rubens's art was under the influence of\r\nthe Church. Further, we find that the most celebrated work of his\r\nearlier period, the _Descent from the Cross_, in the cathedral at\r\nAntwerp, was undertaken in circumstances which abundantly show how\r\nthoroughly he was imbued with the principles of the religion he\r\nprofessed. The story is that when preparing the foundations of his new\r\nhouse he had unwittingly trespassed upon a piece of ground belonging to\r\nthe Company of Arquebusiers at Antwerp. A lawsuit was threatened, and\r\nRubens, with all the vivacity of his nature, prepared measures of\r\nresistance. But when his friend Rockox, a lawyer, had proved him that he\r\nwas in the wrong, he immediately drew back, and offered to paint a\r\npicture by way of compensation. The offer was accepted, and the\r\nArquebusiers asked for a representation of their patron, S. Christopher,\r\nto be placed in his chapel in the cathedral. In the magnificent spirit\r\nwhich always distinguished the man, he presented to his adversaries not\r\nmerely the figure of the great Saint, but an elaborate and significant\r\nillustration of his name (Christ-bearer). Thus, in the centre, the\r\ndisciples are lifting the Saviour from the Cross; in the wings the\r\nVisitation--S. Simeon with Christ in his arms, S. Christopher with\r\nChrist on his shoulders, and an old hermit bearing a light.\r\n\r\nAmong the earlier examples of secular pictures one of the most famous is\r\nthe portrait of himself and his bride, which is now in the Munich\r\nGallery. This was painted in 1609, when Rubens was over thirty years\r\nold.\r\n\r\nIn 1627 Rubens went to Madrid on a diplomatic errand, but still as a\r\npainter, as we shall see when discussing his relations with Velasquez.\r\n\r\nTowards the end of the year 1629 he was sent on another diplomatic\r\nmission, this time to England. The choice of an ambassador could not\r\nhave fallen on anyone better calculated to suit the personal character\r\nof Charles I., who was a passionate lover of art and easily captivated\r\nby men of cultivated intellect and refined manners. Rubens therefore, in\r\nwhom the most admirable and attractive qualities were united to the\r\nrarest genius as an artist, soon succeeded in winning the attention and\r\nregard of the king. At Paris, too, Rubens had made friends with\r\nBuckingham, who had purchased his whole collection of statues,\r\npaintings, and other works of art for about ten thousand pounds.\r\n\r\nIt was during his stay in London that he painted the picture now in the\r\nNational Gallery, called _Peace and War_ (No. 46). This was intended as\r\nan allegory representing the blessings of peace and the horrors of war,\r\nwhich he presented to the king as a tangible recommendation of the\r\npacific measures which he had come to propose. After the dispersion of\r\nthe Royal Collection during the Commonwealth this picture was acquired\r\nby the Doria family at Genoa, where it was called, oddly enough,\r\n_Rubens's Family_. As a matter of fact the children are those of\r\nBalthazar Gerbier. He also painted the _S. George and the Dragon_,\r\nwhich is now at Windsor Castle, and made the sketches for the nine\r\npictures on the ceiling of the Banqueting Hall--now the United Service\r\nInstitution Museum--in Whitehall. It was on this occasion, too, that he\r\nreceived the honour of knighthood from Charles I., who is said to have\r\npresented him with his own sword.\r\n\r\nIn the following year, 1630, Rubens married his second wife, Helena\r\nFourment, who was only sixteen years old--he was now fifty-two or\r\nfifty-three. She belonged to one of the richest and most respectable\r\nfamilies in Antwerp, and was by no means unworthy of the compliment of\r\nbeing painted in the character of the Virgin receiving instruction from\r\nS. Anne, in the picture which is still at Antwerp.\r\n\r\nIn 1633 his painting was again interrupted by a diplomatic mission, this\r\ntime to Holland; and his remaining years were subject to more\r\ndistressing interruptions, from the gout, to which he finally succumbed\r\nin 1640.\r\n\r\nWhen we come to consider the English School of painting we shall see how\r\nmuch of its revival in the middle of the eighteenth century was due to\r\nthe personality as well as to the genius of Sir Joshua Reynolds. In the\r\nNetherlands, likewise, it was not merely a great painter that was\r\nrequired to raise the art to life, but a great personality as well; and\r\nto the influence of Rubens may be attributed much if not all of the\r\nextraordinary fertility of the Flemish and Dutch Schools of the\r\nseventeenth century. Making every allowance for the difference in the\r\ntimes in which the Van Eycks and Rubens were working, there is no doubt\r\nthat the former lived in too rarefied an atmosphere ever to influence\r\ntheir fellows, and with the exception of Hans Memling they left no\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PLATE XXIV.--RUBENS\r\n\r\nPORTRAIT OF HÉLÈNE FOURMENT, THE ARTIST'S SECOND WIFE, AND TWO CHILDREN\r\n\r\n_Louvre, Paris_]\r\n\r\none worthy to carry on their tradition. Rubens showed his contemporaries\r\nthat art was a mistress who could be served in many ways that were yet\r\nunthought of, and that she did not by any means disdain the tribute of\r\nother than religious votaries. Beginning, as we have pointed out, with\r\nsacred subjects, Rubens soon turned to the study of the classics, and\r\nfound in them not so much the classical severity that Mantegna had\r\nsought for as the pagan spirit of fulness and freedom. \"I am convinced\r\nthat to reach the highest perfection as a painter,\" he himself writes\r\n\"it is necessary, not only to be acquainted with the ancient statues,\r\nbut we must be inwardly imbued with the thorough comprehension of them.\r\nAn insight into the laws which pertain to them is necessary before they\r\ncan be turned to any real account in painting. This will prevent the\r\nartist from transferring to the canvas that which in sculpture is\r\ndependent on the material employed--marble, for instance. Many\r\ninexperienced and indeed experienced painters do not distinguish the\r\nmaterial from the form which it expresses--the stone from the figure\r\nwhich is carved in it; that which the artist forces from the dead\r\nmarble, from the universal laws of art which are independent of it.\r\n\r\n\"One leading rule may be laid down, that inasmuch as the best statues of\r\nantiquity are of great value for the painter, the inferior ones are not\r\nonly worthless but mischievous: for while beginners fancy they can\r\nperform wonders if they can borrow from these statues, and transfer\r\nsomething hard, heavy, with sharp outlines and an exaggerated anatomy to\r\ntheir canvas, this can only be done by outraging the truth of nature,\r\nsince instead of representing flesh with colours, they do but give\r\ncolour to marble.\r\n\r\n\"In studying even the best of the antique statues, the painter must\r\nconsider and avoid many things which are not connected with the art of\r\nthe sculptor, but solely with the material in which he worked. I may\r\nmention particularly the difference in the shading. In nature, owing to\r\nthe transparency of the flesh, the skin, and the cartilages, the shading\r\nof many parts is moderated, which in sculpture appear hard and abrupt,\r\nfor the shadows become doubled, as it were, owing to the natural and\r\nunavoidable thickness of the stone. To this must be added that certain\r\nless important parts which lie on the surface of the human body, as the\r\nveins, folds of the skin, etc., which change their appearance with every\r\nmovement, and which owing to the pliancy of the skin become easily\r\nextended or contracted, are not expressed at all in the works of\r\nsculptors in general--though it is true that sculptors of high talent\r\nhave marked them in some degree. The painter, however, must never omit\r\nto introduce them--with proper discretion.\r\n\r\n\"In the manner in which lights fall, too, statues are totally different\r\nfrom nature; for the natural brilliancy of marble, and its own light,\r\nthrows out the surface far more strongly than in nature, and even\r\ndazzles the eye.\"\r\n\r\nI have quoted rather more of this passage (from Mrs Jameson's\r\ntranslation) than I at first intended, because it discloses one of the\r\nmost important secrets of the successful painting of figures, by other\r\nartists besides Rubens himself--George Romney for example. The\r\nadvantages of a \"classical education\" at our English public schools and\r\nuniversities are questioned, and there can be no doubt that for the bulk\r\nof the pupils they are questionable. But Rubens shows that the case is\r\nexactly the same for painters studying classical art as for scholars\r\nacquainting themselves with classical literature. A superficial study of\r\nthe antique, just because it is antique, is of no use at all, but rather\r\na hindrance. But if the study is properly undertaken, there is no surer\r\nfoundation, in art or literature, on which to build. It makes no\r\ndifference what is built; the foundation is there, beneath the surface,\r\nand whatever is placed upon it will stand for all time.\r\n\r\nThe remarkable freedom and originality of Rubens's treatment of\r\nclassical subjects is thus accounted for. Under the surface is his\r\nfamiliarity with the antique, but instead of carrying this above ground,\r\nhe builds on it a palace in accordance with the times and circumstances\r\nin which he lived. The principles of classical art underlie the modern\r\nstructure. Among his numerous works of classical mythology the picture\r\nat Munich of _Castor and Pollux_ carrying off the daughters of Leucippus\r\nis worthy of being first mentioned. The Dioscuri mounted on spirited\r\nsteeds, one of which is wildly rearing, are in the act of capturing the\r\ntwo damsels. The calm expression of strength in the male, and the\r\nviolent but fruitless resistance of the female figures, form a striking\r\ncontrast. Although the former are merely represented as two coarse and\r\npowerful men, and the women have only common and rather redundant forms\r\nand Flemish faces, yet the picture produces as a whole such a striking\r\neffect, owing to the admirable manner in which the subject is conceived,\r\nthe power of imagination which it displays, and the exquisite colouring\r\nand tone, that it would never occur to any unprejudiced spectator to\r\nregret the absence of antique forms and character.\r\n\r\nTwo other pictures of this class are singled out for description by\r\nWaagen as masterpieces. One is the _Rape of Proserpine_, at\r\nBlenheim,--Pluto in his car, drawn by fiery brown steeds, is carrying\r\noff the goddess, who is struggling in his arms. The other is the _Battle\r\nof the Amazons_, in the Munich Gallery, which was painted by Rubens for\r\nVan der Geest. With great judgment he has chosen the moment when the\r\nAmazons are driven back by the Greeks over the river Thermodon: the\r\nbattle takes place upon a bridge, and thus the horror of the scene is\r\ncarried to the highest pitch.\r\n\r\nBoth in Flanders and in Italy Rubens had been brought into close contact\r\nwith all the magnificence and splendour which belonged to those gorgeous\r\ntimes, and he delighted in representing the pomp of worldly state and\r\neverything connected with it. Of all sacred subjects none afforded such\r\na rich field for display as the _Adoration of the Kings_; he has painted\r\nthis subject no less than twelve times, and his fancy appears quite\r\ninexhaustible in the invention of the rich offerings of the eastern\r\nsages. Among the subjects of a secular character the history of Marie\r\nde'Medici, the triumph of the Emperor Charles V., and the Sultan at the\r\nhead of his Army, gave him abundant opportunities of portraying Oriental\r\nand European pageantry, with rich arms and regalia, and all the pomp and\r\ncircumstance of war. Profusion--pouring forth of abundance, that was one\r\nof Rubens's most salient characteristics. Exuberance, plenty, fatness.\r\n\r\nAs a painter of animals, again, Rubens opened out a new field for the\r\nenergy of his fellow-countrymen, which was tilled so industriously by\r\nFrans Snyders and Jan Fyt, and in a lesser degree by the Dutchmen Jan\r\nWeenix, father and son, and Hondecoeter. That the naïve instincts,\r\nagility, and vivacity of animals must have had a great attraction for\r\nRubens is easily understood. Those which are remarkable for their\r\ncourage, strength, intelligence, swiftness--as lions, tigers, wild\r\nboars, wolves, horses, dogs--particularly interested him. He paid\r\nspecial attention to animals, seized every opportunity of studying them\r\nfrom nature, and attained the most wonderful skill and facility in\r\npainting them. It is related that he had a remarkably fine and powerful\r\nlion brought to his house in order to study him in every variety of\r\nattitude, and that on one occasion observing him yawn, he was so pleased\r\nwith the action that he wished to paint it. He therefore desired the\r\nkeeper to tickle the animal under the chin to make him repeatedly open\r\nhis jaws: at length the lion became savage at this treatment, and cast\r\nsuch furious glances at his keeper, that Rubens attended to his warning\r\nand had the beast removed. The keeper is said to have been torn to\r\npieces by the lion shortly afterwards: apparently the animal had never\r\nforgotten the affront put upon him.\r\n\r\nBy such means--though it is to be hoped not always with such lamentable\r\nresults--Rubens succeeded in seizing and portraying the peculiar\r\ncharacter and instinct of animals--their quick movements and\r\nmanifestations of strength--with such perfect truth and energy that not\r\none among the modern painters has approached him in this\r\nrespect--certainly not Landseer, as Mrs Jameson would ask us to believe.\r\n\r\nThe celebrated _Wolf Hunt_, in the collection of Lord Ashburton, was one\r\nof the earliest, painted in 1612 for the Spanish General Legranes only\r\nthree years after Rubens's return from Italy. In this picture, his bold\r\ncreative fancy and dramatic turn of mind are remarkably\r\nconspicuous--even at this early stage in his career. Catherine Brant,\r\nhis first wife, on a brown horse, with a falcon in her hand, is near her\r\nhusband; a second huntsman on horseback, three on foot, another old\r\nwolf and three young ones, with several dogs, complete the composition,\r\nwhich is most carefully painted in a clear and powerful tone throughout.\r\n\r\nOf scenes of peasant life, one of his earliest, and yet the most famous,\r\nis the _Kermesse_, which is now in the Louvre. A boisterous, merry party\r\nof about seventy persons are assembled in front of a country ale-house;\r\nseveral are wildly dancing in a circle, others are drinking and\r\nshouting; others, again, are making love.\r\n\r\n_The Garden of Love_, equally famous, was one of Rubens's latest\r\npictures. Of this there are several versions in existence, of which\r\nthose at Dresden and Madrid may be considered as originals. Several\r\nloving couples in familiar conversation are lingering before the\r\nentrance of a grotto, the front of which is ornamented with a rustic\r\nportico. Amongst them we recognise the portraits of Rubens and his\r\nsecond wife, his pupil Van Dyck, and Simon de Vos.\r\n\r\nAs Rubens united to such great and various knowledge the disposition to\r\ncommunicate it to others in the most friendly and candid manner, it was\r\nnatural that young painters of talent who were admitted into his atelier\r\nshould soon attain a high degree of skill and cultivation.\r\n\r\nAt \"the House in the Wood,\" not far from the Hague, there is a salon\r\ndecorated entirely by the pupils of Rubens. The principal picture, which\r\nis one of the largest oil paintings in the world, is by Jacob Jordaens,\r\nand represents the triumph of Prince Frederick Henry--the object of the\r\nwhole scheme being the glorification of the House of Orange, in 1649.\r\nMost of the other pictures are of Theodore van Thulden, who in these\r\nworks has emulated his illustrious master in the force and brilliance of\r\nhis colouring.\r\n\r\nBut it is not in any particular salon or palace that we must look for\r\nthe effects of Rubens' influence; it was far wider than to be able to be\r\ncontained within four walls. In portraiture he gave us Van Dyck; in\r\nhistorical subjects, Jacob Jordaens; in animal painting and still life,\r\nFrans Snyders, Jan Fyt, and the brothers Weenix. In pictures of everyday\r\nlife he gave us Adrian Brouwer and David Teniers; in landscape,\r\nEverdingen, Ruisdael and Waterloo. \"Thus was the art of painting in the\r\nNetherlands remodelled in every department,\" says Waagen in the\r\nconcluding sentence of his memoir, \"by the energies of a single great\r\nand gifted mind. Thus was Rubens the originator of its second great\r\nepoch, to which we are indebted for such numerous and masterly\r\nperformances in every branch of the art.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIII\r\n\r\nTHE PUPILS OF RUBENS\r\n\r\n\r\nDAVID TENIERS the elder, who was born at Antwerp in 1582, received the\r\nfirst rudiments of his art from Rubens, who soon perceived in him the\r\nhappy advances towards excelling in his profession that raised him to\r\nthe head of his school. The prejudice in favour of his son, David\r\nTeniers the younger, is so great that the father is generally esteemed\r\nbut a middling painter; and his pictures not worth the inquiry of a\r\ncollector. His hand is so little distinguished, however, that the\r\npaintings of the father are often taken for those of the son. The father\r\nwas certainly the inventor of the manner, which the son, who was his\r\npupil, only improved with what little was wanting to perfection.\r\n\r\nRubens was astonished at his early success, and though he followed the\r\nmanner of Adrian Brouwer, looked on him as his most deserving pupil by\r\nthe brightness of genius that he showed. He soon saved enough money to\r\nundertake the journey to Italy, and when at Rome he established himself\r\nwith Adam Elsheimer, who was then in great vogue. In Elsheimer's manner\r\nhe soon became a perfect master, without neglecting at the same time the\r\nstudy of other and greater masters, endeavouring to penetrate into the\r\ndeepest mysteries of their practice. An abode of ten years in Italy, and\r\nthe influence of Elsheimer combined with that of Rubens, formed him into\r\nwhat he became.\r\n\r\nWhen he returned to his own country he employed himself entirely in\r\npainting small pictures filled with figures of people drinking and\r\nmerry-making, and numbers of peasants and country women. He displayed so\r\nmuch taste in these that the demand for them was universal. Even Rubens\r\nthought them an ornament to his collection.\r\n\r\nTeniers drew his own character in his pictures, and in the subjects he\r\nusually expressed everything tends to joy and pleasure. Always employed\r\nin copying after nature whatsoever presented itself, he taught his two\r\nsons, David and Abraham, to follow his example, and accustomed them to\r\npaint nothing but from that infallible model, by which means they both\r\nbecame excellent painters. These were his only disciples, and he died at\r\nAntwerp in 1649.\r\n\r\nThe only distinction between his works and those of his son, David\r\nTeniers the younger, is that in the latter you discover a finer touch, a\r\nfresher brush, a greater choice of attitudes, and a better disposition\r\nof the figures. The father, too, retained something of the tone of\r\nItaly in his colouring, which was stronger than his son's; but his\r\npictures have less harmony and union--though to tell the truth, when the\r\nfather took pains to finish his picture, he very nearly resembled his\r\nson.\r\n\r\nThe latter, DAVID TENIERS the younger, was born in 1610. He was\r\nnicknamed the Ape of painting, from his powers of imitation. The\r\nArchduke Leopold William made him a gentleman of his bedchamber, and he\r\nmade copies of all his pictures. He came to England to buy several\r\nItalian pictures for Count Fuensaldegna, who on his return heaped\r\nfavours upon him. Don John of Austria and the King of Spain set so great\r\na value upon his pictures that they built a gallery set apart to\r\npreserve them--there are no less than fifty-two in the Prado Gallery\r\nto-day.\r\n\r\nHis principal talent was landscape adorned with small figures. He\r\npainted men drinking and smoking, alchemists, corps de garde,\r\ntemptations of S. Anthony, and country fairs and merry-makings. His\r\nsmall pictures are superior to his large ones. His execution displays\r\nthe greatest ease; the leafing of his trees is light, his skies are\r\nadmirable: his small figures have an exquisite expression and a most\r\nlively touch, and the characters are marked out with the greatest truth.\r\nFrom the thinness of the colours his works seem to have been finished at\r\nonce; they are generally clear in all their parts, and Teniers had the\r\nart, without dark shades, to relieve his lights by other lights, so well\r\nmanaged as to produce the effect he wanted, an art which few besides\r\nhimself have attained. He died at Antwerp in 1694.\r\n\r\nFRANS SNYDERS was born at Antwerp in the year 1587, ten years later,\r\nthat is to say, than Rubens. He received his first instruction in the\r\nart of painting from Henry van Balen. His genius at first displayed\r\nitself only in painting fruit. He afterwards attempted animals, in\r\nwhich kind of study he succeeded so well that he surpassed all that had\r\never excelled before him. He stayed for some time in Italy, and the\r\nworks he met with there by Castiglione proved a spur to his genius to\r\nattempt outdoing him in painting animals. When he returned to Flanders\r\nhe fixed his ordinary abode at Brussels, where he was made painter to\r\nthe Archduke and Duchess, and became attached to the house of Spain.\r\nTwenty-two of his pictures are in the Prado Gallery.\r\n\r\nWhen Snyders required large figures in his compositions both Rubens and\r\nJordaens took pleasure in assisting him, and Rubens in turn borrowed the\r\nassistance of Snyders to paint the ground of his pictures; thus they\r\nmutually assisted each other in their labours, while Snyders' manly and\r\nvigorous manner was quite able to hold its own even when joined with\r\nthat of the great master.\r\n\r\nANTHONY VAN DYCK was born at Antwerp in 1599, less than three months\r\nbefore Velasquez at Seville. Both became so famous in their capacity of\r\nCourt painters that the rest of their achievement is popularly regarded\r\nas little more than a bye-product.\r\n\r\nIn the case of Van Dyck there is the more excuse for the English public,\r\ninasmuch as, like Holbein before him, he was exclusively employed while\r\nin this country in the production of portraits; and as \"his works are so\r\nfrequent in England,\" as Horace Walpole observes in the opening sentence\r\nof his memoir in the \"Anecdotes of Painting,\" \"that the generality of\r\nour people can scarce avoid thinking him their countryman,\" it is easy\r\nenough to forget that he only spent the last nine years of his life\r\nhere.\r\n\r\nAgain, the insatiable craze of the English and American public for\r\nportraits has helped to obscure the extent of Van Dyck's capabilities in\r\nother directions, and while the National Gallery contains not a single\r\nsubject-piece from his hand, more and more thousands are continually\r\nspent in the acquisition of more and more portraits. The bewitching\r\n_Cupid and Psyche_ in Queen Mary's closet at Hampton Court, painted a\r\nyear before his death, is scarcely known to exist!\r\n\r\nAt the same time it would be useless to deny that Van Dyck's principal\r\nclaim to his place among the greatest masters rests chiefly upon\r\nportraiture. The point I wish to make is that portrait painting never\r\nyet made a great master, but that none but a great master ever became a\r\ngreat portrait painter; and so long as we are only permitted to see the\r\nparticular achievement of the artist in our public galleries, so long is\r\nit likely that we shall continue to be flooded with mediocre likenesses\r\nof fashionable people by painters whose highest or whose only\r\nachievement they constitute. Anyone can write a \"short story\" for the\r\ncheaper sort of modern journal; only writers like Hardy, Stevenson, or\r\nKipling can give us a masterpiece in little.\r\n\r\nIt was said that Rubens advised Van Dyck to devote himself to\r\nportraiture out of jealousy: but that is hardly in accordance with what\r\nwe know of his generous nature. If the advice was given at all we may be\r\nsure that it was given in a friendly spirit. But there was something in\r\nthe temperament of Van Dyck which peculiarly fitted him for the Court,\r\napart from any question as to his excellence in any particular branch of\r\nhis art, and it is evident that the personality of Rubens, and his\r\nconnection with the rich and mighty of the earth, influenced him almost\r\nas much as did his art. How much he owed to Rubens, and how much Rubens\r\nowed to him in painting is a matter that is arguable. He had been\r\nseveral years with Van Balen before he entered the studio of Rubens,\r\nwhen eighteen years old, not as a pupil but as an assistant. Here he not\r\nonly had the practical task of painting Rubens's compositions for him,\r\nin company with numerous others, but had also the advantage of studying\r\nthe works of Titian and other of the great Italian masters in Rubens's\r\nfamous collection. If the hand of Van Dyck is traceable in some of the\r\npictures of Rubens at this period, so the spirit of Rubens is very\r\nobvious in those of Van Dyck. The chief thing to be remembered is that\r\nin these early days he was not painting portraits. His earliest works,\r\nin which the influence of Titian is perceptible as well as that of\r\nRubens, are the _Christ bearing the Cross_, in S. Paul's at Antwerp,\r\npainted in 1618; the _S. Sebastian_ at Munich, and the _Christ Mocked_,\r\nat Berlin. The familiar portrait of _Cornelius van der Geest_ in the\r\nNational Gallery, is one of his very earliest, probably before 1620.\r\nAgain, on his first visit to Genoa, in 1621, on the advice of Rubens,\r\nhis ambition was not to paint portraits, as on his second visit some\r\nyears later, but to rival Rubens in the composition of great historical\r\npieces. It was not until 1627, when he left behind him in Genoa the\r\nsuperb series of Balbi, Brignole-Sala, Cattaneo, and Lomellini\r\nportraits, and returned to Antwerp to undertake those such as the _Le\r\nRoys_ at Hertford House, or the _Beatrice de Cusance_ at Windsor, that\r\nhe had really become a portrait painter. Even then, he was still\r\ndetermined not to yield to Rubens at Antwerp, and painted, amongst other\r\nsubjects, the _Rinaldo and Armida_ for Charles I. It was only at the\r\nsolicitation of George Geldorp, a schemer as well as a painter, that he\r\nconsented at length, in 1632, to come to England; and it was only the\r\nwelcome afforded to him by Charles that induced him to settle here.\r\n\r\nTwo considerations of personal vanity may be suggested as actuating\r\nCharles to be specially indulgent to Van Dyck--an indulgence of which\r\nthe results posterity should not omit to credit to the sad account of\r\nthe martyr--first, that his father had failed to retain the painter in\r\nhis service, and second, that Velasquez, who had made a sketch of him on\r\nhis mad visit to Madrid in 1623, was then immortalising Philip.\r\nVelasquez being out of the question, why not Van Dyck! An excellent\r\nidea! Especially when instead of dwarfs, buffoons, and idiots, the\r\nEnglish Court contained some exceedingly fine material besides the royal\r\nfamily for the artist to exercise his talent upon.\r\n\r\nAfter this, Flanders knew Van Dyck no more, save for a year or two's\r\nsojourn from 1633-1635 when he painted one or two magnificent portraits,\r\nand then returned to England, where he died in 1641. With the death of\r\nRubens the year before, Flemish painting had suffered another eclipse;\r\nand though Snyders lived till 1657, and Jordaens and the younger Teniers\r\ncontinued till late in the century, no fresh seedlings appeared, and the\r\nsoil again became barren. Rubens and Van Dyck were both too big for the\r\nlittle garden--their growth overspread Europe.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_DUTCH SCHOOL_\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI\r\n\r\nFrans Hals\r\n\r\n\r\nMeantime we must turn our attention to Holland, where FRANS HALS, who\r\nwas born only three years later than Rubens, namely in 1580, was the\r\nforerunner of Rembrandt, Van der Helst, Bol, Lely, and a host more of\r\ngreater or less painters, who made their country as famous in the\r\nseventeenth century for art as their fathers had made it in the\r\nsixteenth for arms. Without going into the complications of the\r\npolitical history of the Netherlands at this period, it is important\r\nnevertheless to remember that while the Flemish provinces remained\r\nCatholic under Spain, the northern states, after heroic struggles,\r\nformed themselves into a Republic; so that while it is difficult to draw\r\na hard and fast line between what was Dutch and what was Flemish in\r\nestimating the influence of one particular painter upon another, there\r\nis no question at all as to vital difference between the conditions\r\nwhich led to the production of the pictures of the two schools. The\r\nFlemish pictures were for the Church and for the Court, the Dutch for\r\nthe house, the Guildhall, or the bourgeoisie. The former were\r\naristocratic, the latter democratic. Rubens and Van Dyck were\r\naristocrats, Hals and Rembrandt democrats. Rubens painted altar-pieces,\r\nfor the great churches or cathedrals or for the chapels of his patrons.\r\nRembrandt painted Bible stories for whoever would purchase them. Van\r\nDyck painted the portraits of kings and nobles. Hals painted the rough\r\nsoldiers and sailors, singly, or in the great groups into which they\r\nformed themselves as Guilds. For the first time in the history of\r\npainting, neither Church nor Court were its patrons.\r\n\r\nIn any age or under any circumstances Frans Hals would have seemed a\r\nremarkable painter, but to measure his extraordinary genius to its full\r\nheight we must try to realise what those times and those circumstances\r\nwere. In Florence and Venice, as we have seen, there were great schools\r\nof painting, and in Florence especially, the whole city existed in an\r\natmosphere of art. There was no escape from it. In Haarlem, where Hals\r\nspent his youth (he was born in Antwerp), there was no such state of\r\naffairs. There were no chapels to be decorated, no courtiers to be\r\nflattered. The country was seething with the effects of war, and the\r\nwhole population were ready for it again at a moment's notice. There\r\nwere plenty of heroes--every man was one--but not of the romantic sort.\r\nThey were all bluff, hardy fellows, who wanted to get on with their\r\nbusiness. Who would have thought that they wanted to have their\r\nportraits painted? And who, accordingly, could have induced them to do\r\nso except a bluff, roystering genius like Hals, who slashed them down on\r\ncanvas before they had time to stop him? Once it got wind that Hals was\r\nsuch a good fellow, and that he dashed off a portrait to the life in as\r\nlittle time as it took to pass the time of day with him, he had plenty\r\nof business, and from painting single portraits he was commissioned to\r\nglorify the Guilds by depicting their banquets, which he did with\r\nalmost as much speed and considerably more fidelity than the limelight\r\nman at a City dinner in these times. His first great group--_The Archers\r\nof S. George_, at Haarlem--has all the appearance of being painted\r\ninstantaneously as the banqueters stood around the table before\r\ndispersing.\r\n\r\nWhen we think of the cultured Rubens, brought up in the atmosphere of\r\nCourts, and studying for years among the finest paintings and painters\r\nin Italy, and compare him with this low, ignorant fellow, who had never\r\nbeen outside the Netherlands, do we not find his genius still more\r\namazing? Nowadays we see a portrait by Hals surrounded with the finest\r\nworks of the greatest painters in all times and in all lands, and see\r\nhow well it stands the comparison. But our admiration must be increased\r\na hundredfold, when we know that he was without any of the training or\r\ntradition of a great artist, and that it must have been by sheer\r\ncharacter and genius alone that he forced his art upon his commercial,\r\nthough heroic public.\r\n\r\nOne thing especially it is interesting to notice about the Dutch\r\nportraits of the early Republican period, namely, that they are\r\nobviously inspired by the pleasure of having a living, speaking likeness\r\nrather than by pride and ostentation. Bluff and swaggering as some of\r\nHals's portraits of men appear to be--notably _The Laughing Cavalier_,\r\nat Hertford House--that is only because the subjects were bluff and\r\nswaggering fellows--swaggering, that is to say, in the consciousness of\r\ntheir ability and their readiness to defend their country and their\r\nhomes again, if need be, against the tyrant. But these swaggerers are\r\nthe exception, and the prevailing impression conveyed is that of\r\nhonest, if determined, bluffness. They are not posing, these jolly\r\nDutchmen, they are sitting or standing, for Hals to paint them just as\r\nthey would sit or stand to be measured for a suit of clothes. Look at\r\nthe heads of the man and the woman in the National Gallery. Could\r\nanything be more natural and unassuming? Look at the _Laughing\r\nCavalier_, and ask if it is not the man himself, as Hals saw and knew\r\nhim, not a faked up hero? Hals caught him in his best clothes, that is\r\nall. He did not put them on to be painted in--he was out on a jaunt.\r\nLook at Hals's women, how pleased they are to be painted, just as they\r\nare.\r\n\r\nPoor Hals, he was a good, honest fellow, though sadly given to drink and\r\nlow company. But for sheer genius he has never had an equal. The vast\r\nnumber of his paintings--many of which now only exist in copies--shows\r\nthat with every predilection to ease and comfort, he could not help\r\npainting--it simply welled out of him. It was a natural gift which seems\r\nto have needed no labour and no study.\r\n\r\nIt is certain that this fecundity was a very potent factor in the\r\ndevelopment of the Dutch School of painting. Had Hals confined his\r\ntalent to painting the portraits of the highest in the land, which would\r\nnever have been seen by the public at large, it is improbable that such\r\na business-like community would have produced many painters. But Hals\r\nmust have popularised painting much more than we generally suppose. An\r\nexample occurs to me in the picture of _The Rommelpot Player_, of which\r\nno less than thirteen versions are enumerated by De Groot, none of which\r\ncan claim to be the original. One is at Wilton, another in Sir Frederick\r\nCook's gallery at Richmond, and a third at Arthingworth Hall in\r\nNorthamptonshire.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PLATE XXV.--FRANS HALS\r\n\r\nPORTRAIT OF A LADY\r\n\r\n_Louvre, Paris_]\r\n\r\nThe subject is an old beggar man playing in front of the door of a\r\ncottage on a ridiculous instrument consisting of an earthen pot covered\r\nover like a jampot with a lid of parchment, on which he makes a rude\r\nnoise with a stick, to the intense delight of a group of children. A\r\npicture like this, then, it is evident, instead of hanging in solitary\r\nconfinement in the house of a great person, was so widely popular that\r\nit was copied on all sides, and must have been seen by thousands of\r\npeople.\r\n\r\nNext to Hals, in point of time, was HENDRIK GERRITZ POT, who was born,\r\nprobably at Haarlem, in 1585. It is to him rather than to Ostade, who\r\nwas a quarter of a century later, that we must trace the origin of\r\nsmaller _genre_ pictures of the Dutch School which in later years became\r\nits principal product. Pot's works are neither very important nor very\r\nnumerous, but as a portrait painter he is represented in the Louvre by a\r\nportrait of Charles I., which was probably painted when he was in\r\nEngland in 1631 or thereabouts; while at Hampton Court is a beautiful\r\nlittle piece by him which is catalogued under the title of _A Startling\r\nIntroduction_. This belonged to Charles I., for his cypher is branded on\r\nthe back of the panel on which it is painted, and it was sold by the\r\nCommonwealth as \"a souldier making a strange posture to a Dutch lady by\r\nBott.\" The painter's monogram H.P. appears on the large chimney piece\r\nbefore which the \"soldier\" is standing.\r\n\r\nGERARD HONTHORST, born at Utrecht in 1590, can hardly be said to belong\r\nto the Dutch School at all. When he was only twenty he went to Rome,\r\nwhere his devotion to painting effects of candle-light earned him the\r\nsobriquet of \"Gherardo della Notte.\" In 1628 he was elected Dean of the\r\nGuild of St. Luke at Utrecht, but he was in no sense a national painter,\r\nand neither took nor gave anything in the way of national influence. He\r\nwas in England for a few months in 1628, to which chance we are indebted\r\nfor the picture of the Duke of Buckingham and his family which is in the\r\nNational Portrait Gallery, and another group of the Cavendish family\r\nwhich is at Chatsworth. Pictures of the nobility, or of celebrities like\r\nHarvey, the discoverer of the circulation of the blood, were more in his\r\nline than those of his republican patriots, and consequently he plays no\r\npart in the development of the school we are now considering.\r\n\r\nBARTHOLOMEW VAN DER HELST, born in Amsterdam, 1613, died there 1670. He\r\nis by far the most renowned of the Dutch portrait-painters of this\r\nperiod. Although nothing is known as regards the master under whom he\r\nstudied, it is probable that if Hals was not actually his teacher, his\r\nworks were the models whence Van der Helst formed himself. We see this\r\nin the portrait of Vice-Admiral Kortenaar at Amsterdam, where the\r\nconception of forms, and the unscumbled character of the strokes of the\r\nbrush, recall Hals. The same may be observed in two larger pictures with\r\narchers in the Town Hall at Haarlem, where the inartistic arrangement\r\nand monotony of the otherwise warm flesh tones point to the earlier time\r\nof the painter. By about the year 1640 his character was more fully\r\ndeveloped. His arrangement of portrait-pieces with numerous figures\r\nbecame very artistic and easy, his tone excellent, and his drawing\r\nmasterly. This standard of excellence he retained till about 1660. The\r\nfollowing are principal pictures of this period:--A scene from the\r\nArchery Guild of Amsterdam in 1639, including thirty figures. The\r\ncelebrated picture inscribed 1648, an Archery Festival commemorating the\r\nPeace of Westphalia, and consisting of a party of twenty-four persons,\r\nat Amsterdam. The chief charm of this work consists in the strong and\r\ntruthful individuality of every part, both in form and colour; in the\r\ncapital drawing, which is especially conspicuous in the hands; in the\r\npowerful and clear colouring; and finally, in a kind of execution which\r\nobserves a happy medium between decision and softness. In 1657 he\r\nexecuted the picture of the Archery Guild known by the name \"het\r\nDoelenstück\" at Amsterdam Gallery. This work represents three of the\r\noverseers of the Guild, with golden prize vases, and a fourth supposed\r\nto be the painter himself. It is almost surpassed by a replica on a\r\nsmaller scale executed in the following year, which is now in the\r\nLouvre. At all events, this picture is in better preservation, and\r\noffers one of the most typical examples of portrait-painting that the\r\nDutch School produced.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nII\r\n\r\nREMBRANDT VAN RYN\r\n\r\n\r\nBut the greatest of all the Dutch painters, in some ways the greatest\r\npainter that has ever lived, was REMBRANDT VAN RYN (1606-1669). Beside\r\nhim all the rest seem merely commonplace, and their works the product of\r\nthis or that demand, according to their different times and\r\ncircumstances, executed with more or less skill. For Rembrandt there\r\nseems no place among them all--he must stand somewhere alone; and there\r\nis no standard by which to judge his perfections and imperfections\r\nexcept the man himself.\r\n\r\nPerhaps the greatest difference between Rembrandt and any other painter\r\nis that he never seems to have tried to please the public, but only\r\npainted to please himself. It is for this reason, no doubt, that he was\r\nnever popular with the public, and is never likely to be; but just as\r\nBeethoven is only understandable by the really musical soul, so\r\nRembrandt's appeal is to those who have the feeling for something in\r\npainting beyond the mere representation of familiar or heroic scenes and\r\npersons on canvas. For the public it is enough that one of his\r\nlandscapes should be sold for £100,000, and they all flock to see it;\r\nbut put a fine Rembrandt portrait in a shop-window without a name to it,\r\nand there would be little fear of the pavement being blocked.\r\n\r\nThis failure of Rembrandt to please the public of his own day brings out\r\nthe truth that the practice of painting had up to then subsisted only so\r\nlong as it supplied a popular demand; and when we come to consider what\r\nthat demand was, we find that it is for nothing else but a pleasing\r\nrepresentation of natural objects, which may or may not embody some\r\nsentimental or historical association, but must first and foremost be a\r\nfair representation of more or less familiar things.\r\n\r\nThe oldest story about pictures is that of Zeuxis and the bunch of\r\ngrapes, which relates that he painted the fruit so like nature that the\r\nbirds came and pecked at the painting--some versions, I believe, adding\r\nthat the fruit itself was there but they preferred the painting. Similar\r\nstories with innumerable variations are told of later artists. Rembrandt\r\nhimself is said to have been deceived by his pupils who, knowing he was\r\ncareful about collecting money in small quantities, however extravagant\r\nhe might be in spending it, painted coins on the floor of the studio,\r\nand enjoyed the joke of seeing him stoop to pick them up. We have heard,\r\ntoo, of flies painted with surprising skill in conspicuous places to\r\ndeceive the unwary. But apart from these little pleasantries, one has\r\nonly to remember how the earlier writers on painting have expressed\r\nthemselves to see how much importance, consciously or unconsciously, was\r\nattached to life-like resemblance to the object painted. Vasari is\r\nconstantly using phrases in which he extols the painter for having made\r\na figure look like the life, as though that were the real thing to be\r\naimed at. We remember Ben Jonson's lines under Shakespeare's\r\nportrait----\r\n\r\n    \"Wherein the graver had a strife\r\n    With nature to outdo the life.\"\r\n\r\nAnd though Ben Jonson was not a critic, and if he had been there was\r\nlittle enough art in his time in England for him to criticize, still he\r\nexpresses the general feeling of the public for any work of art.\r\n\r\nWith the Dutch people this was most certainly the case, and the\r\npopularity of the painters of scenes of everyday life is a proof of it.\r\nThat Hals, Brouwer, or Ostade were great painters was not half so\r\nimportant to them, if indeed they thought of it all, as that they were\r\ncapable of turning out pictures which reflected their everyday life like\r\na mirror.\r\n\r\nSo long as Rembrandt painted portraits like those of the Pellicornes and\r\ntheir offspring--the two pictures at Hertford House--or a plain\r\nstraightforward group like Dr Tulp's _Anatomy Lesson_ (though in this he\r\nwas already getting away from convention), he was tolerated. And it was\r\nnot so much his freedom in living and his extravagant notions of the\r\npleasures of life that brought about his downfall, as his failure to\r\nrealize that when he took the money subscribed for the group of Captain\r\nBanning Cocq's Company, the subscribers expected something else for\r\ntheir money than a picture (_The Night Watch_) which might be a\r\nmasterpiece according to the painter's notions, but was certainly not a\r\nportrait group of the subscribers.\r\n\r\nHere, then, for the first time in the history of painting, we find an\r\nartist definitely at issue with the public. I do not say that this was\r\nthe first time that an artist had failed to please the public, but it is\r\nthe first occasion on which it was decided that if a painter was to\r\nundertake commissions, he must consider the wishes of the patron, or\r\nstarve. It was something new for a painter of Rembrandt's repute to be\r\ntold that not he, but the persons who commissioned the work, were to be\r\nthe judges of whether or not it was satisfactory.\r\n\r\nThe consequences were important. For Rembrandt, instead of taking the\r\nmatter as a man of business, devoted the rest of his life to being an\r\nartist, and leaving the business of painting to men like Backer, Helst,\r\nand others, betook himself seriously to developing his art irrespective\r\nof what the public might or might not think of it. As a result, we have\r\nin the later work of Rembrandt something that the world--I mean the\r\nartistic part of it--would be very sorry to do without. Now the meaning\r\nof this is, not that Rembrandt was ill-advised in deserting his patrons,\r\nor in suffering them to desert him, but that for the first time in the\r\nhistory of painting an artist had the personality--I will not say the\r\nconscious determination--to realize that his art was something quite\r\napart from the affairs of this world, and that what he could express on\r\ncanvas was _not_ merely a representation of natural objects designed to\r\nplease his contemporaries, but something more than human, something that\r\nwould appeal to humanity for all time. That many before him had felt\r\nthat of their art, to a lesser or greater degree, is unquestionable--but\r\nnone of them had ever realised it. Dürer, certainly, may be cited as an\r\nexception, especially when contrasted with his phlegmatic and\r\nbusiness-like compatriot Holbein. But then Dürer, a century before, and\r\nin totally different circumstances, was never assured of regular\r\npatronage as was Rembrandt.\r\n\r\nRembrandt was the son of a miller named Harmann Geritz, who called\r\nhimself Van Ryn, from the hamlet on the arm of the Rhine which runs\r\nthrough Leyden. His mother was the daughter of a baker. He was entered\r\nas a student at the University of Leyden, his parents being comfortably\r\noff; but he showed so little taste for the study of the law, for which\r\nthey intended him, that he was allowed to follow his own bent of\r\npainting, in the studio of a now forgotten painter, Jacob van\r\nSwanenburg. Here he studied for about three years, after which he went\r\nto Amsterdam and was for a short time with another painter named\r\nLastman, who was a clever but superficial imitator of the Italian School\r\nthen flourishing in Rome.\r\n\r\nReturning to Leyden, Rembrandt set up his easel and remained there\r\npainting till 1631, when he went to Amsterdam. His works during this\r\nfirst period are not very well known in this country, but at Windsor and\r\nat Edinburgh are portraits of his mother, which must belong to it.\r\n\r\nThe next decade was the happiest and most prosperous in Rembrandt's\r\ncareer. At Amsterdam he soon found favour with wealthy patrons, and his\r\nhappiness and success were completed by his marrying Saskia van\r\nUlenburgh, the sister of a wealthy connoisseur and art dealer, with whom\r\nRembrandt had formed an intimate friendship. To this period belong the\r\nnumerous portraits of himself and Saskia, alone or together, most of\r\nwhich are characterized by a barbaric splendour of costume, utterly\r\ndifferent from the profusion of Rubens, but far more intense. Living\r\namong the wealthiest Jews in Amsterdam, he seems to have been strongly\r\nattracted by their orientalism, and while Rubens gloried in natural\r\nabundance of every sort, and painted the bounty of nature in the full\r\nsunlight, Rembrandt chose out the treasures of art, and painted costume\r\nand jewels gleaming out of the darkness. The portraits of himself in a\r\ncap at Hertford House (No. 52), and of the Old Lady in the National\r\nGallery (No. 775), both painted in 1634, are notable examples of this\r\nperiod, though they have none of the orientalism to be seen in the\r\nvarious portraits of Saskia, or in _The Turk_ at Munich. The two double\r\nportraits at Hertford House of Jean Pellicorne and his wife with their\r\nson and daughter respectively, were among the commissions which he\r\nreceived after he set up at Amsterdam, and are therefore less\r\ninteresting as self-revelations. Prosperity is not always the best\r\ncondition under which to produce the highest work, and the temperament\r\nof Rembrandt was so peculiar that there is little wonder that the prim\r\nDutchmen were not entirely captivated by his exuberant sensuality, or\r\nthat we ourselves reserve our admiration principally for the more sombre\r\nand mysterious products of his later years after misfortune began to\r\nfall upon him.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PLATE XXVI.--REMBRANDT\r\n\r\nPORTRAIT OF HENDRICKJE STOFFELS\r\n\r\n_Louvre, Paris_]\r\n\r\nIn 1642 the beloved Saskia died, leaving an only child, Titus, whose\r\nfeatures are familiar to us in the portrait at Hertford House. As though\r\nthis were not affliction enough, Rembrandt had the mortification of\r\noffending his patrons over the commission to paint Captain Banning\r\nCocq's Company. From this time onward, as the world and Rembrandt\r\ndrifted farther and farther apart, his work becomes more and more\r\nwonderful.\r\n\r\nDr Muther, in his _History of Painting_, observes that perhaps it is\r\nonly possible to understand Rembrandt by interpreting his pictures not\r\nas paintings but as psychological documents. \"A picture by Rembrandt in\r\nthe Dresden Gallery,\" he says, \"represents _Samson Putting Riddles to\r\nthe Philistines_; and Rembrandt's entire activity, a riddle to the\r\nphilistines of his time, has remained puzzling to the present day.... As\r\nno other man bore his name, so the artist, too, is something unique,\r\nmocks every historical analysis, and remains what he was, a puzzling,\r\nintangible, Hamlet nature--Rembrandt.\" The author's theory of the\r\npsychological document is hardly a solution of the admitted puzzle,\r\nthough it is interesting to follow him in tracing it out in Rembrandt's\r\nreligious pictures, from the _Samson_ already mentioned to his last\r\ndated work, in 1668, the Darmstadt _Crucifixion_. What distinguishes\r\nRembrandt from all painters up to, and considerably later than his time,\r\nand in particular from those of his own school, is the mental, as\r\ncompared with the physical activity that his pictures represent. Perhaps\r\nthis is only another way of stating Dr Muther's theory of the\r\npsychological documents, but it enables us to test that theory by\r\ncomparing his work with that of others. In technical skill Beruete\r\nclaims a far higher place for Velasquez, going so far as to say that\r\nthe _Lesson in Anatomy_ is not a lesson in painting. But the difference\r\nbetween the two is not as great as that in technique, though infinitely\r\nwider in the mental process which led to the production of a picture. A\r\nreproduction of the _Portrait of an Old Pole_, at S. Petersburg, is in\r\nfront of me, as it happens, as I am writing; and I see in this no\r\ninferiority in firmness and precision, in truth and vigour, to any\r\nportrait by Velasquez.\r\n\r\nIn their technical ability to present the life-like portrait of a real\r\nman, we can place Rembrandt, Velasquez, Hals, and Van Dyck on pretty\r\nmuch of a level; if we had _Van der Geest_, _Montanes_, the _Old Pole_\r\nand the _Laughing Cavalier_ all in a row, we should find there was not\r\nmuch to choose between them for downright realization. But while in the\r\nwork of Velasquez we see the working of a fine and sensitive\r\nappreciation of his friend's personality, and the most exquisite\r\nrealization of what was before him, in that of Rembrandt we seem to see\r\nless of the Pole and more of Rembrandt himself. It is as though he were\r\nsinging softly to himself while he was painting, thinking his own\r\nthoughts: while Velasquez was simply concerned with the appearance and\r\nthe thoughts of his model.\r\n\r\nThat Rembrandt's pictures are self-revelations, or psychological\r\ndocuments, is certainly true; and a proof of it is in the extraordinary\r\nnumber of portraits of himself. The famous Dresden picture of himself\r\nwith Saskia on his knee can only be regarded in that light, and that\r\nbrings into the category all the numerous pictures of Saskia and of\r\nHendrike Stoffels, who formed so great a part of his life. If to these\r\nwe add, with Dr Muther, his Biblical subjects, we find that there is\r\nnot so very much left, and when we turn to the life's work of Rubens,\r\nTitian, Velasquez, or in fact any of the great painters, the difference\r\nis at once apparent. So that in the pictures of Rembrandt we may expect\r\nto find less of what we look for in those of others in the way of\r\ndisplay, but infinitely more of the qualities which, to whatever extent\r\nthey exist in other artists, are bound to be sacrificed to display. When\r\nwe are asked to a feast, we find the room brilliantly lit, and our host\r\nthe centre of an assemblage for whom he has felt it his duty to make a\r\ndisplay consistent with his means and his station. If we were to peep\r\ninto his house one night we might find him in a room illumined only with\r\nhis reading-lamp, absorbed in his favourite study; but instead of only\r\nexchanging a few conventional phrases with him, and passing on to mingle\r\nwith his guests and to enjoy his hospitality, we might sit and talk with\r\nhim into the small hours. That is the difference between the success of\r\nHals with his _Feast of S. George_, and the failure of Rembrandt with\r\n_The Night Watch_. Hals was at the feast, and of it. Rembrandt was\r\nwrapped up in himself, and didn't enter into the spirit of the\r\ncompany--he was carried away by his own. That is why his pictures are so\r\ndark--not of deliberate technical purpose, like those of the\r\n_Tenebrosi_, but because to him a subject was felt within him rather\r\nthan seen as a picture on so many square feet of canvas. When we call up\r\nin our own minds the recollection of some event of more than usually\r\ndeep significance in our past, we only see the deathbed, the two\r\ncombatants, the face of the beloved, or whatever it may be; the\r\naccessories are nothing, unless our imagination is stronger than the\r\nsentiment evoked, and sets to work to supply them. It is this\r\ncharacteristic which so sharply distinguishes the work of Rembrandt\r\nfrom that of his closest imitators. There is a large picture in the\r\nNational Gallery, _Christ Blessing the Children_, catalogued as \"School\r\nof Rembrandt,\" in which we see as near an approach to his manner as to\r\njustify the attribution, but that is all. I do not know why it has never\r\nbeen suggested that this is the work of NICOLAS MAES, who was actually\r\nhis pupil, and who was one of the few Dutch artists to paint life-sized\r\ngroups, as he is known to have done in his earlier days when still under\r\nthe influence of Rembrandt. _The Card Players_, close beside it, has\r\nmarked affinities in style, and especially in the very natural\r\ncharacterization of the faces, which is also apparent in that of the\r\nchild in the other picture, and another on the extreme left of the\r\npicture. That it cannot be Rembrandt's is quite evident; the grouping\r\nand the lighting of it proclaim the picture seen on the canvas, and not\r\nfelt within the artist's own consciousness.\r\n\r\nThe realistic tendency which, as has already been pointed out, was so\r\ncharacteristic of the whole art of the Netherlands, showed the most\r\nremarkable and original results in the work of an idealist like\r\nRembrandt. Sandrart, one of the earliest writers on painting, says that\r\nRembrandt \"usually painted things of a simple and not thoughtful\r\ncharacter, but which were pleasing to the eyes, and\r\npicturesque\"--_schilderachtig_, as the Netherlanders called it. This\r\ncombination of realism and picturesqueness, assisted by his marvellous\r\ntechnical power, put him far above and apart from all his compeers. In\r\nthe absence of any pictures by his masters Van Swanenburg and Pinas, it\r\nis difficult to ascertain what, if anything, he learnt from them. From\r\nPeter Lastman we may be sure he learnt nothing in the way of technique.\r\nKugler--who in these paragraphs is my principal authority--suggests that\r\nit is highly probable that in this respect he formed himself from the\r\npictures of Frans Hals, with which he must have been early acquainted in\r\nthe neighbouring town of Haarlem. At all events unexampled freedom,\r\nspirit, and breadth of his manner is comparable with that of no other\r\nearlier Dutch master. But all these admirable qualities would offer no\r\nsufficient compensation for the ugly and often vulgar character of his\r\nheads and figures, and for the total subversion of all the traditional\r\nrules of art in costume and accessory, and would fail to account for the\r\ngreat admiration which his works enjoy, if he had not been possessed,\r\nbesides, of an intensely artistic individuality.\r\n\r\nIn his earliest pictures his touch is already masterly and free, but\r\nstill careful, while the colour of the flesh is warm and clear and the\r\nlight full. _Dr Tulp's Anatomy_, painted in 1632, is the most famous of\r\nthis period. In _The Night Watch_, at Amsterdam, dated 1642, the light\r\nis already restricted, falling only on isolated objects; the local tone\r\nof the flesh is more golden; the touch more spirited and distinct.\r\nLater, that is to say from about 1654 onwards, the golden flesh tones\r\nbecome still more intense, passing sometimes into a brown of less\r\ntransparency, and accompanied frequently with grey and blackish shadows\r\nand sometimes with rather cool lights. The chief picture of this epoch,\r\ndated 1661, is _The Syndics_, also at Amsterdam, a group of six men.\r\nThis, in the depth of the still transparent golden tone, in the\r\nanimation of the heads, and in body and breadth of handling, is a true\r\nmasterpiece.\r\n\r\nWith respect to his treatment of Biblical subjects, two older writers,\r\nKolloff and Guhl, accord him an honour which, as we shall see, Kugler\r\ngives to Dürer a century earlier, namely that of being the painter of\r\nthe true spirit of the Reformed Church. Though it is certain, Kugler\r\nadmits, that no other school of painting in Rembrandt's time--neither\r\nthat of Rubens, nor that of the Carracci, nor the French nor Spanish\r\nschools--rendered the spiritual import of Biblical subjects with the\r\npurity and depth exhibited by the great Dutch master. Here the kindly\r\nelement of deep sentiment combines most happily with his feeling for\r\ncomposition, as in the _Descent from the Cross_, at Munich, in _The Holy\r\nFamily_, in the Louvre, and above all in _The Woman taken in Adultery_,\r\nin the National Gallery. In this last, a touching truthfulness and depth\r\nof feeling, with every other grand quality peculiar to Rembrandt, are\r\nseen in their highest perfection. Of hardly less excellence, also, is\r\nour _Descent from the Cross_.\r\n\r\nEndowed with so many admirable qualities, it follows that Rembrandt was\r\na portrait painter of the highest order, while his peculiar style of\r\nlighting, his colouring and treatment, distinguish his portraits from\r\nthose by all other masters. Even the works of his most successful\r\npupils, who followed his style in this respect, are far behind him in\r\nenergy of conception and execution. The number of his admirable\r\nportraits is so large that it is difficult to know which to mention as\r\nmost characteristic. No other artist ever painted his own portrait so\r\nfrequently, and some of these may first be mentioned. That in the\r\nLouvre, dated 1633, represents him in youthful years, fresh and full of\r\nhope. It is spiritedly painted in the bright tone of his earlier period.\r\nAnother in the same gallery, of the year 1660, painted with\r\nextraordinary breadth and certainty of hand of that later period, shows\r\na man weighed down with the cares of life, with grey hair and deeply\r\nfurrowed forehead.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PLATE XXVII.--REMBRANDT\r\n\r\nPORTRAIT OF AN OLD LADY\r\n\r\n_National Gallery, London_]\r\n\r\nThe one at Hertford House, already mentioned, and two in the National\r\nGallery, fall between these extremes. Of other portraits we have already\r\nmentioned the two Pellicorne groups in the Wallace Collection; and\r\nanother of this earliest period, the very popular _Old Woman_, in the\r\nNational Gallery, dated 1634. This is of greater interest as showing, if\r\nanything does, whether it is fair to attribute any of his training to\r\nthe influence of Hals. At any rate this picture is a highly important\r\nproof that at the early age of twenty-six, the painter was already in\r\nthe full possession of that energy and animation of conception, and of\r\nthat decision of the \"broad and marrowy touch\" which are so\r\ncharacteristic of him. Of his later period--probably about 1657--a fine\r\nexample is _The Jewish Rabbi_, and of his latest the _Old Man_, both in\r\nthe National Gallery.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIII\r\n\r\nPAINTERS OF GENRE\r\n\r\n\r\nThe painters of _genre_, by the number, quality, and diversity of whose\r\npictures the Dutch School is specially distinguished, may be roughly\r\ndivided into three classes; namely, those who studied the upper, the\r\nmiddle, and the lower classes respectively. But as Holland was a\r\nrepublic, and the great stream of its art welled up from the earth and\r\nwas not showered upon it from above, it will be found convenient to\r\nreverse the social order in considering them, and begin with the\r\nimmediate successors of Frans Hals, whose influence was without doubt a\r\nvery considerable factor in the development of Adrian Brouwer and Adrian\r\nand Isaac Ostade.\r\n\r\nADRIAN BROUWER, now generally classed under the Flemish School, was\r\nborn at Oudenarde in 1606. But he went early to Haarlem, and it was not\r\nuntil about 1630 that he settled at Antwerp, where he died in 1641. He\r\nwas a pupil of Frans Hals, and acquired from him not only his spirited\r\nand free touch, but also a similar mode of life. His pictures, which for\r\nthe most part represent the lower orders eating and drinking, often in\r\nfurious strife, are extraordinary true and life-like in character, and\r\ndisplay a singularly delicate and harmonious colouring, which inclines\r\nto the cool scale, an admirable individuality, and a _sfumato_ of\r\nsurface in which he is unrivalled; so that we can well understand the\r\nhigh esteem in which Rubens held them. Owing to his mode of life, and to\r\nits early close, the number of his works is not large, and they are now\r\nseldom met with. No gallery is so rich in them as Munich, which\r\npossesses nine, six of which are masterpieces. _A Party of Peasants at a\r\nGame of Cards_, affords an example of the brightness and clearness of\r\nthose cool tones in which he evidently became the model of Teniers.\r\n_Spanish Soldiers Throwing Dice_, is equally harmonious, in a subdued\r\nbrownish tone. _A Surgeon Removing the Plaster from the Arm of a\r\nPeasant_ is not only most masterly and animated in expression, but is a\r\ntype of his bright, clear, and golden tone, and is singularly free and\r\nlight in touch. _Card-players Fighting_, is in every respect one of his\r\nbest pictures. The momentary action in each figure, all of them being\r\nindividualized with singular accuracy even as regards the kind of\r\ncomplexion, is incomparable, the tenderness of the harmony astonishing,\r\nand the execution of extraordinary delicacy. The only example in the\r\nNational Gallery is the _Three Boors Drinking_, bequeathed by George\r\nSalting in 1910; and at Hertford House the _Boor Asleep_, though of\r\nthis we may without hesitation accept the description in the catalogue,\r\n\"our painting is of the highest quality, and in the audacity of its\r\nrealism rises almost to grandeur.\"\r\n\r\nADRIAN VAN OSTADE, said to have been born at Lubeck, was baptized in\r\n1610 at Haarlem, where he studied under Frans Hals, and he formed a very\r\ngood taste in colouring. Nature guided his brush in everything he\r\nundertook; he devoted himself almost entirely to painting peasants and\r\ndrunkards, whose gestures and most trifling actions were the subject of\r\nhis most serious meditation. The subjects of his little pictures are not\r\nmore elevated than those of Brouwer, and considerably less than those of\r\nTeniers--they are nearly always alehouses or kitchens. He is perhaps one\r\nof the Dutch masters who best understood chiaroscuro. His figures are\r\nvery lively, and he sometimes put them into the pictures of the best\r\npainters among his countrymen. Nothing can excel his pictures of\r\nstables, in which the light is spread so judiciously that all one could\r\nwish is a lighter touch in his drawing, and a little more height in his\r\nfigures. Many of his brother Isaak's pictures are improperly attributed\r\nto him, which, though painted in the same manner, are never of the real\r\nexcellence of Adrian's.\r\n\r\nThe _Interior with Peasants_ at Hertford House, and _The Alchymist_ at\r\nthe National Gallery are a characteristic pair of his pictures, which\r\nwere sold in the collection of M. de Jully in 1769 for £164, the former\r\nbeing purchased by the third Marquess of Hertford and the latter passing\r\ninto the Peel Collection. _Buying Fish_, at Hertford House, dated\r\n1669--when the artist was nearly sixty years old, is remarkable for its\r\nbreadth of effect and brilliancy of colour.\r\n\r\nJAN STEEN, born at Leyden about the year 1626, died 1679. He first\r\nreceived instruction under Nicolas Knupler; and afterwards it is said\r\nworked with Jan van Goyen, whose daughter he married. An extraordinary\r\ngenius for painting was unfortunately co-existent in Jan Steen with\r\njovial habits of no moderate kind. The position of tavern-keeper in\r\nwhich he was placed by his family, gave both the opportunity of\r\nindulging his propensities and also that of depicting the pleasures of\r\neating and drinking, of song, card-playing and love-making directly from\r\nnature. He must have worked with amazing facility, for in spite of the\r\ntime consumed in this mode of life, to which his comparatively early\r\ndeath may be attributed, the number of his pictures is very great. His\r\nfavourite subjects were groups like the _Family Jollification_; the\r\n_Feast of the Bean King_; and that form of diversion illustrating the\r\nproverb, \"_So wie die Alten sungen, so pfeifen auch die Jungen_\"; fairs,\r\nweddings, etc.; he also treated other scenes, such as the Doctor's\r\nVisit, the Schoolmaster with a generally very unmanageable set of\r\nboys--of which is a charming example at Dublin. The ludicrous ways of\r\nchildren seem especially to have attracted him; accordingly, he depicts\r\nwith great zest the old Dutch custom on St. Nicholas's Day, September\r\n3rd, of rewarding the good, and punishing the naughty child; or shows a\r\nmischievous little urchin teasing the cat, or stealing money from the\r\npockets of their, alas!--drunken progenitors.\r\n\r\nJan Steen is the most genial painter of the whole Dutch School. His\r\nhumour has made him so popular with the English, that at least\r\ntwo-thirds of his pictures are in their possession.\r\n\r\nA peculiar cluster of masters, belonging to the Dutch\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PLATE XXVIII.--TERBORCH\r\n\r\nTHE CONCERT\r\n\r\n_Louvre, Paris_]\r\n\r\nSchool, was formed by Gerard Dou. However careful in execution were such\r\npainters as Terburg, Metsu, and Netscher, yet Gerard Dou and his\r\nscholars and imitators surpassed them in the development of that\r\ntechnical finish with which they rendered the smallest detail with\r\nmeticulous exactitude.\r\n\r\nGERARD DOU was born at Leyden on the 7th April 1613, died there 1680. He\r\nentered Rembrandt's school at fifteen years of age, and in three years\r\nhad attained the position of an independent artist. He devoted himself\r\nat first to portraiture, and, like his master, made his own face\r\nfrequently his subject. Afterwards he treated scenes from the life\r\nchiefly of the middle classes. He took particular pleasure in the\r\nrepresentation of hermits; he also painted scriptural events and\r\noccasionally still life. His lighting is frequently that of lanterns and\r\ncandles. Most of his pictures contain only from one to three figures,\r\nand do not exceed about 2 ft. high and 1 ft. 3 in. wide, being often\r\nsmaller. His pictures seldom attain even an animated moral import, and\r\nmay be said to be limited usually to a certain kindliness of sentiment.\r\nOn the other hand, he possessed a trace of his master's feeling for the\r\npicturesque, and for chiaroscuro. Notwithstanding the incalculable\r\nminuteness of his execution, the touch of his brush is free and soft,\r\nand his best pictures look like Nature seen through the camera-obscura.\r\nHis works were so highly estimated in his own time, that the President\r\nvan Spiring, at the Hague, offered him 1000 florins a year for the right\r\nof pre-emption of his pictures. Considering the time which such finish\r\nrequired, and the early age at which he died, the number of his\r\npictures--Smith enumerates about 200--is remarkable. In the Louvre are\r\nthe following:--An old woman seated at a window, reading the Bible to\r\nher husband; this is one of the best among the many representations by\r\nDou of a similar kind, being of warm sunny effect, and marvellous\r\nfinish. Also the _Woman with the Dropsy_, which is accounted his\r\n_chef-d'oeuvre_.\r\n\r\nAmong the scholars of Gerard Dou, FRANS VAN MIERIS, born at Leyden 1635,\r\ndied 1681, takes the first place. In chiaroscuro, and in delicacy of\r\nexecution he is not inferior to his master. Although his pictures are\r\ngenerally very small, yet with their extraordinary minuteness of\r\nexecution it is surprising that, in a life extended only to forty-six\r\nyears, he should have produced so many. The Munich Gallery has most,\r\nthen Dresden, Vienna, Florence, and St. Petersburg. The date, 1656, on a\r\npicture in the Vienna Gallery, _The Doctor_, shows the painter to have\r\nattained the summit of his art at twenty-one years of age. Another dated\r\n1660, in the same gallery, executed for the Archduke Leopold, is one of\r\nhis best. The scene is a shop with a young woman showing a gentleman,\r\nwho has taken her by the chin, various handkerchiefs and stuffs. In the\r\nMunich Gallery is _A Soldier_, dated 1662, of admirable transparency and\r\nsoftness. Also _A Lady_ in a yellow satin dress fainting in the presence\r\nof the doctor. In the Hague Gallery is _A Boy Blowing Soap-bubbles_,\r\ndated 1663. This is a charming little picture of great depth of the\r\nbrownish tone. Also _The Painter and His Wife_, whose little shock dog\r\nhe is teasing; very naïve and lively in the heads, and most delicately\r\ntreated in a subdued but clear tone. In the Dresden Gallery are Mieris\r\nagain and his wife before her portrait. This is one of his most\r\nsuccessful pictures for chiaroscuro, tone, and spirited handling.\r\n\r\nNICOLAS MAES, already mentioned, born at\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PLATE XXIX.--GABRIEL METSU\r\n\r\nTHE MUSIC LESSON\r\n\r\n_National Gallery, London_]\r\n\r\nDordrecht 1632, died 1693, was actually a pupil of Rembrandt. His much\r\nprized and rare _genre_ pictures treat very simple subjects, and consist\r\nseldom of more than two or three figures, generally of women. The\r\nnaïvete and homeliness of his feeling, with the addition sometimes of a\r\ntrait of kindly humour; the admirable lighting, and a touch resembling\r\nRembrandt in impasto and vigour, render his pictures very attractive. In\r\nthe National Gallery, besides _The Card Players_, are _The Cradle_, _The\r\nDutch Ménage_, dated 1655; and _The Idle Servant_: all these are\r\nadmirable, and the last-named a _chef-d'oeuvre_.\r\n\r\nPETER DE HOOGH (1629-1677) decidedly belongs to the numerous artistic\r\nposterity of Rembrandt, possibly through Karel Fabritius, and stands\r\nnearer to Vermeer and to Maes, than to any other painter. His biography\r\ncan only be gathered from the occasional dates on his pictures,\r\nextending from 1658 to 1670. Although he impresses the eye by the same\r\neffects as Maes, yet he is also very different from him. He has not his\r\nhumour, and seldom his kindliness, and his figures, which are either\r\nplaying cards, smoking or drinking, or engaged in the transaction of\r\nsome household duty,--with faces that say but little--have generally\r\nonly the interest of a peaceful or jovial existence. If Maes takes the\r\nlead in warm lighting, Peter de Hoogh may be considered _par excellence_\r\nthe painter of full and clear sunlight. If, again, Maes shows us his\r\nfigures almost exclusively in interiors, Peter de Hoogh places them most\r\nfrequently in the open air--in courtyards. In the representation of the\r\npoetry of light, and in that marvellous brilliancy and clearness with\r\nwhich he calls it forth in various distances till the background is\r\nreached, which is generally illumined by a fresh beam, no other master\r\ncan compare with him. His prevailing local colour is red, repeated with\r\ngreater delicacy in various planes of distance. This colour fixes the\r\nrest of the scale. His touch is of great delicacy; his impasto\r\nadmirable.\r\n\r\nGERARD TERBURG, born at Zwol 1608, died 1681, learned painting under his\r\nfather, and when still young visited Germany and Italy, painting\r\nnumerous portraits on a small scale, and occasionally the size of life.\r\nBut his place in the history of art is owing principally to a number of\r\npictures, seldom representing more than three, and often only one\r\nfigure, taken from the wealthier classes, in which great elegance of\r\ncostume, and of all accompanying circumstances, is rendered with the\r\nfinest keeping, and with a highly delicate but by no means over-smooth\r\nexecution. He may be considered as the originator of this class of\r\npictures, in which, after his example, several other Dutch painters\r\ndistinguished themselves. With him the chief mass of light is generally\r\nformed by the white satin dress of a lady, which gives the tone for the\r\nprevailing cool harmony of the picture. Among his pictures we\r\noccasionally find some which, taken successively, represent several\r\ndifferent moments of one scene. Thus in the Dresden Gallery, there are\r\ntwo good pictures: the one of an officer writing a letter, while a\r\ntrumpter waits for it; the other of a girl in white satin washing her\r\nhands in a basin held before her by a maid-servant; while at Munich, is\r\nanother fine work, in which the trumpeter is offering the young lady the\r\nletter, who owing to the presence of the maid, who evidently\r\ndisapproves, is uncertain whether to take the missive. Finally, in the\r\nAmsterdam Gallery, the celebrated picture known by the title of _Conseil\r\npaternel_, furnishes\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PLATE XXX.--PIETER DE HOOCH\r\n\r\nINTERIOR OF A DUTCH HOUSE\r\n\r\n_National Gallery, London_]\r\n\r\nthe closing scene. The maid has betrayed the affair to the father, and\r\nhe is delivering a lecture to the young lady, in whom by turning her\r\nback on the spectator, the painter has happily expressed the feeling of\r\nshame; good repetitions are in the Berlin Museum, and in the Bridgewater\r\nGallery. But Terburg's perfection as regards the clearness and harmony\r\nof his silvery tone is shown in a picture at Cassel, representing a\r\nyoung lady in white satin sitting playing the lute at a table.\r\n\r\nJAN VERMEER OF DELFT (1632-1675) was certainly a pupil of Fabritius, and\r\nthus \"grandson\" of Rembrandt. To class him with painters of _genre_\r\nseems almost a profanation of the exquisite sense of beauty with which,\r\nalmost alone among the Dutch painters, he seems to have been endowed. It\r\nis like classing Walter Pater with art critics. But as Vermeer had to\r\nexpress himself in some form, it is perhaps fortunate that the school\r\nhad developed this kind of poetic portraiture, under Terburg, Metsu and\r\nothers, to a point where a genius like Vermeer could use it as the\r\nvehicle of his fascinating self-revelations. In landscape we have the\r\n_View of Delft_, at the Hague, which has shown the nineteenth century\r\npainters more than they could ever see in their more famous\r\npredecessors; but it is in the simple compositions like _The Letter\r\nReader_ at Amsterdam, _The Proposal_, at Dresden, or the _Lady at the\r\nVirginals_, in the National Gallery, that he displays his greatest power\r\nand charm.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIV\r\n\r\nPAINTERS OF ANIMALS\r\n\r\n\r\nAs a link between the painters of _genre_ and the landscapists, we may\r\nhere mention some of the numerous artists who either made landscape the\r\nbackground for groups of figures and animals, or peopled their\r\nlandscapes with groups--it matters not which way we put it. Among these\r\nwe shall find several of the most famous, or at any rate the most\r\npopular artists of the Dutch School.\r\n\r\nPHILIPS WOUVERMAN (1619-1668), whose reputation during the last century\r\nwas greater than that of almost any of the Dutch painters except\r\nRembrandt and Dou, is said to have studied under Hals, but it is more\r\ncertain that the master from whom he learnt most, if not all, was Jan\r\nWynants at Haarlem, whose whole manner in landscape he quickly succeeded\r\nin acquiring, and surpassed him in his facility with horsemen and other\r\nfigures.\r\n\r\nWouverman's works have all the excellences that may be expected from\r\nhigh finishing, correctness, agreeable composition and colouring. It\r\ndoes not appear that he was ever in Italy, or even quitted the city of\r\nHaarlem, though it would seem probable that his more elaborate\r\ncompositions owed something to other influences than those of Hals or\r\nWynants. In his earlier pictures there are no horses, but later in his\r\ncareer he generally subordinated his landscapes to the groups or\r\nsubjects for which he is most famous. In the National Gallery, among\r\neleven examples, are a _Halt of Officers_, _Interior of a Stable_, _A\r\nBattle_, _The Bohemians_, and _Shoeing a Horse_, all of which contain\r\nnumerous figures, mounted and unmounted--and there is nearly always a\r\nwhite horse.\r\n\r\nWith all his success, he died a poor man, and it is related that in his\r\nlast hours he burned a box filled with his studies and drawings, saying,\r\n\"I have been so ill repaid for all my labours, that I would not have\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PLATE XXXI.--JAN VERMEER\r\n\r\nTHE LACE MAKER\r\n\r\n_Louvre, Paris_]\r\n\r\nthose designs engage my son to embrace so miserable a profession as\r\nmine.\" This son followed his advice, and became a Chartreux friar. Peter\r\nand Jan Wouverman were his brothers. The former painted hawking scenes,\r\nand his horses, though well designed, were not equal to those of\r\nPhilips. The latter is represented in the National Gallery by a\r\nlandscape in which the spirit of Wynant's, rather than that of\r\nPhilips's, is discernible.\r\n\r\nAt Hertford House, out of seven examples, two are of more than usual\r\nexcellence, and well represent his earlier and later manners. _The\r\nAfternoon Landscape with a White Horse_ (No. 226 in Room XIII), which\r\nSmith (in his Catalogue Raisonné), characterizes as possessing unusual\r\nfreedom of pencilling, and powerful effect, dates from the transition\r\nfrom the early to the middle period, and is a very effective picture, as\r\nwell as being very characteristic. The _Horse Fair_ (No. 65, in Room\r\nXVI), is not only much larger than the other--it measures 25 x 35\r\ninches--but is a really important picture. Lord Hertford paid £3200 for\r\nit in 1854. It was engraved by Moyrean, for his series of a hundred\r\nprints after Wouverman, under the title of _Le Grand Marché aux\r\nChevaux_. It is thus described by Smith:--\"This very capital picture\r\nexhibits an open country divided in the middle distance by a river whose\r\ncourse is lost among the distant mountains. The principal scene of\r\nactivity is represented along the front and second grounds, on which may\r\nbe numbered about twenty-four horses, exhibiting that noble animal in\r\nevery variety of action, and nearly fifty persons. On the right of the\r\npicture is a coach, drawn by four fine grey horses, and in front of this\r\nobject are a grey and a bay horse, on the latter of which are mounted a\r\nman and a boy. In advance of them is a group of four horses and several\r\npersons, among whom may be noticed a cavalier and a lady observing the\r\npaces of a horse which a jockey and his master are showing off. A\r\ngentleman on a black horse seems also to be watching the action of the\r\nanimal. Near this person is a mare lying down, and a foal standing by it\r\nwhich a boy is approaching. On the opposite side of the picture is a\r\ngentleman on a cream-coloured horse, near two spirited greys, one of\r\nwhich is kicking, and a woman, a man and a boy are escaping from its\r\nheels. From thence the eye looks over an open space occupied by men and\r\nhorses, receding in succession to the bank of the river, along which are\r\nhouses and tents concealed in part by trees. This picture is painted\r\nthroughout with great care and delicacy in what is termed the last\r\nmanner of the master, remarkable for the prevalent grey or silvery hues\r\nof colouring.\"\r\n\r\nALBERT CUYP, born at Dortrecht 1620, died there about 1672. Of the life\r\nof this great painter little more is known with any certainty than that\r\nhe was the scholar of his father, Jacob Gerritsz Cuyp. Cattle form a\r\nprominent feature in many of his works, though never so highly finished\r\nas in those of Paul Potter or Adrian van de Velde; indeed, in many of\r\nCuyp's pictures, they are quite subordinate. His favourite subjects, a\r\nlandscape with a river, with cattle lying or standing on its banks, and\r\nlandscapes with horsemen in the foreground, were suggested to him no\r\ndoubt by the country about Dortrecht and the river Maas: but he also\r\npainted winter landscapes, and especially views of rivers where the\r\nbroad extent of water is animated by vessels. Sometimes, too, with great\r\nperfection, fowls as large as life, hens, ducks, etc., and still life.\r\nHe also painted portraits, though less successfully. However great the\r\nskill displayed in the composition of his works, their principal charm\r\nlies in the beauty and truthfulness of their peculiar lighting. No other\r\npainter, with the exception of Claude, has so well understood the cool\r\nfreshness of morning, the bright but misty light of a hot noon, or the\r\nwarm glow of a clear sunset. The effect of his pictures is further\r\nenhanced by the skill with which he avails himself of the aid of\r\ncontrasts; as for example, dark, rich colours of the reposing cattle as\r\nseen against the bright sky. In his own country no picture of his, till\r\nthe year 1750, ever sold for more than thirty florins. Indeed, Kugler\r\nwas informed by a Dutch friend, that in past times, when a picture found\r\nno bidder, the auctioneer would offer to throw in \"a little Cuyp\" in\r\norder to induce a sale. The merit of having first given him his due rank\r\nbelongs to the English, who as early as 1785, gave at the sale of Linden\r\nvan Slingelandt's collection at Dortrecht high prices for Cuyp's works;\r\nAbout nine-tenths of his pictures are consequently to be found in\r\nEngland.\r\n\r\nOne of his finest works is the landscape, in bright, warm, morning\r\nlight, with two cows reposing in the foreground, and a woman conversing\r\nwith a horseman, in the National Gallery (No. 53). The whole picture\r\nbreathes a cheerful and rural tranquillity. In his mature time, these\r\nadmirable qualities are seen in higher development. In the Louvre (No.\r\n104), is another fine example--a scene with six cows, a shepherd blowing\r\nthe horn, and two children listening to him. This is admirably arranged,\r\nof greater truthfulness as regards the form and colouring of the cattle\r\nthan usual, and with the warm lighting of the sky executed with equal\r\ndecision and softness. This picture is one of the master's chief\r\nproductions, being also about 4 ft. high by 6 ft. wide. Another with\r\nthree horsemen, and a servant carrying partridges, and in the centre a\r\nmeadow with cattle, is also in the Louvre. This is less attractive in\r\nsubject, but ranks equally high as a work of art. In Buckingham Palace\r\nare two pictures, one with three cows reposing, and one standing by a\r\nclear stream, near them a herdsman and a woman; other cows are in water\r\nnear the ruins of a castle. In this picture, we see Cuyp in every\r\nrespect at his culminating point of excellence. Not less fine, and of\r\nsingular force of colour, is the landscape, with a broad river running\r\nthrough it, and a horseman under a tree in conversation with a\r\ncountryman.\r\n\r\nPAUL POTTER, born at Enckhuysen 1625, died at Amsterdam 1654. Although\r\nthe scholar of his father, Pieter Potter, who was but a mediocre\r\npainter, he made such astonishing progress as to rank at the age of 15\r\nas a finished artist. He removed very early to the Hague, where his\r\ntalents met with universal recognition, including that of Prince Maurice\r\nof Orange, and where he married. In the year 1652, however, he removed\r\nto Amsterdam at the instance of one of his chief patrons, the\r\nBurgomaster Tulp. Of the masters who have striven pre-eminently after\r\ntruth he is, beyond all question, one of the greatest that ever lived.\r\nIn order to succeed in this aim, he acquired a correctness of drawing, a\r\nkind of modelling which imparts an almost plastic effect to his animals,\r\nan extraordinary execution of detail in the most solid impasto, and a\r\ntruth of colouring which harmonises astonishingly with the time of day.\r\nIn his landscapes, which generally consist of a few willows in the\r\nforeground, and of a wide view over meadows, the most delicate\r\ngraduation of aërial perspective is seen. With few exceptions, his\r\nanimals are small, and his pictures proportionately moderate in size. By\r\nthe year 1647 he had attained his full perfection. Of this date is the\r\ncelebrated group called _The Young Bull_, in the Hague Gallery. All the\r\nfigures in this are as large as life, and so extraordinarily true to\r\nnature as not only to appear real at a certain distance, but even to\r\nkeep up the illusion when seen near.\r\n\r\nA picture dated 1649, now in Buckingham Palace, of two cows and a young\r\nbull in a pasture, combines with his customary fidelity to nature a more\r\nthan common power of effect, and breadth and freedom of treatment. To\r\nthe same year belongs also The _Farmyard_, formerly in the Cassel\r\nGallery, now in that of S. Petersburg, which, according to Smith, fully\r\ndeserves its celebrity both for the clearness and warmth of the sunset\r\neffect, as well as for its masterly execution. To 1650 belongs the\r\npicture of _Orpheus_, charming the animal world by the strains of his\r\nlyre, in the Amsterdam Museum. Here we see that the master had also\r\nstudied wild animals. He is most successful in the bear. In the same\r\ngallery is another _chef-d'oeuvre_ of the same year--a hilly landscape\r\nwith a shepherdess singing to her child, a shepherd playing on the\r\nbagpipe, and oxen, sheep, and goats around.\r\n\r\nThe names of Weenix and Hondecoeter are so inseparably associated in the\r\npopular mind as painters of birds, whose respective works are not\r\nreadily distinguishable moreover by the casual observer, that a short\r\nexcursion into their family histories is advisable, for the purpose of\r\nshowing how it was that this particular branch of the art was so\r\nsuccessfully practised by the two. Moreover, as there were three\r\nHondecoeters and two Weenixes who were painters, it is necessary to say\r\nsomething about each of them.\r\n\r\nMELCHIOR HONDECOETER, the best known, was of an ancient and noble\r\nfamily. He was instructed till the age of seventeen by his father\r\nGysbert, who was a tolerable painter. Giles Hondecoeter, his\r\ngrandfather, painted live birds admirably, but chiefly cocks and hens in\r\nthe taste of Savery and Vincaboom. Melchior was born in 1636, and\r\nstudied for a time with his father; but meantime his aunt Josina had\r\nmarried Jan Baptist Weenix, and a son was born to them, Jan Weenix, who\r\ninherited from old Giles Hondecoeter, his grandfather, his talent for\r\npainting poultry, and from his father, Jan Baptist Weenix, he acquired\r\nthe benefit of several influences which were not shared by his cousin\r\nMelchior.\r\n\r\nJAN BAPTIST WEENIX, who was nicknamed \"Rattle,\" was born at Amsterdam\r\nabout 1621. His father was an architect, who bred his son up to that\r\nprofession, but he was afterwards put to study painting under Abraham\r\nBloemart. Soon after his marriage with Josina he was seized with the\r\ndesire to visit Italy, and he set off alone to Rome, promising to return\r\nin four months. In Rome, however, he was so well received that he stayed\r\nthere four years, and Italianized himself to an extent that may be seen\r\nin a picture in the Wallace Collection, a _Coast Scene with Classic\r\nRuins_, which he signs _Gio. Batta. Weenix_. Though he returned to\r\nHolland and settled near Utrecht, his manner was sensibly modified by\r\nhis sojourn in Rome.\r\n\r\nJAN WEENIX, who was born at Amsterdam in 1649, though he succeeded in so\r\nfar assimilating his father's style that his earlier works are often\r\nconfused with those of \"Giovanni Battista,\" did not acquire the energy\r\nor the dramatic force displayed by Melchior Hondecoeter in representing\r\nlive birds and animals, though he sometimes surpassed him in the finish\r\nand the harmony of his decorative arrangements of dead game and still\r\nlife. Accordingly the one usually painted dead and the latter live\r\nbirds. In other respects there is not much to distinguish their works.\r\n\r\nNICHOLAS BERCHEM was the only other pupil of Jan Baptist Weenix of whom\r\nwe know anything. Berchem had other masters, beginning with his father,\r\nwho was a painter of fish and tables covered with plates, china dishes,\r\nand such like. Having given his son the first rudiments of his art he\r\nfound himself unequal to the task of cultivating the excellent\r\ndisposition he observed in him, and therefore placed him with Van Goyen,\r\nNicholas Moyaert, Peter Grebber, Jan Wils, and lastly with Jan Baptist\r\nWeenix, all of whom had the honour of assisting to form so excellent a\r\npainter. Indefatigable at his easel, Berchem acquired a manner both easy\r\nand expeditious; to see him work, painting appeared a mere diversion to\r\nhim.\r\n\r\nHis wife was the daughter of his instructor, Jan Wils, and was so\r\navaricious that she allowed him no rest. Busy as he was by nature, she\r\nused to sit under his studio, and when she neither heard him sing nor\r\nstir, she struck upon the ceiling to rouse him. She got from him all the\r\nmoney he earned by his labour, so that he was obliged to borrow from his\r\nscholars when he wanted money to buy prints that were offered him, which\r\nwas the only pleasure he had. _The Musical Shepherdess_ at Hertford\r\nHouse is a good example of his style, and the description of it in\r\nSmith's catalogue shows in what estimation the artist was held in early\r\nVictorian days:--\"This beautiful pastoral scene represents a bold rocky\r\ncoast under the appearance of the close of day. The rustics have ended\r\ntheir labours and are recreating with music and dancing. A group\r\ncomposed of two peasants and a like number of women occupies the\r\nforeground; one of the latter, attired in a blue mantle, is gaily\r\nstriking a tambourine, and dancing to the music; her companion in a\r\nyellow dress sits near her; the shepherds also are seated, and one of\r\nthem appears to have just ceased playing a pipe which he holds. The\r\ngoats are browsing near them. Painted in the artist's most fascinating\r\nstyle.\"\r\n\r\nThat Berchem had been to Italy is pretty certain, and though no\r\nauthentic account of his visit is recorded, there is a story that when\r\nJacob Ruisdael went to Rome as a young man, Nicholas Berchem was the\r\nfirst acquaintance he met, and that their friendship was of long\r\nstanding. Their frequent walks round about Rome gave them the\r\nopportunity of working together from Nature, and one day a cardinal\r\nseeing them at work, inquired what they were doing. His eminence was\r\nagreeably impressed with their drawings, and invited them to visit him\r\nin Rome. The painters returned to their work, where they met with a\r\nsecond _rencontre_ of a very different nature; a gang of thieves robbed\r\nand stripped them of their clothes. They returned in their shirts to the\r\ncity, and called on the cardinal, who took pity upon them, ordered them\r\nclothes, and afterwards employed them in several considerable works in\r\nhis palace.\r\n\r\nBerchem at one time took up his abode in the Castle of Bentheim, and as\r\nboth he and Ruisdael have left several pictures of this castle it may be\r\ninferred that they worked there together, as at Rome.\r\n\r\nApart from personal friendship there is nothing to connect Berchem with\r\nRuisdael, the popularity of the former being derived from qualities of a\r\ntotally different nature from those which raise Ruisdael far above any\r\nof his contemporaries as a landscape painter.\r\n\r\nJAN VAN HUYSUM was born at Amsterdam in 1682. His father, Justus Van\r\nHuysum, who dealt in pictures, was himself a middling painter in most\r\nkinds of painting. He taught his son to paint screens, figures and vases\r\non wood, landscape, and sometimes flowers; but the son being arrived at\r\na reasoning age perceived that to work in every branch of his art was\r\nthe way to excel in none, therefore he confined himself to flowers,\r\nfruit, and landscape, and quitting his father's school set up for\r\nhimself.\r\n\r\nNo one before Van Huysum attained so perfect a manner of representing\r\nthe beauty of flowers and the down and bloom of fruit; for he painted\r\nwith greater freedom than Velvet Breughel and Mignon, with more\r\ntenderness and nature than Mario di Fiori, Andrea Belvedere, Michel de\r\nCampidoglio or Daniel Seghers; with more mellowness than de Heem, and\r\nwith more vigour of colouring than Baptist Monoyer.\r\n\r\nHis pictures of flowers and fruit pleasing an English gentleman, he\r\nintroduced them into his own country, where they came into vogue and\r\nyielded a high price. To express the motions of the smallest insects\r\nwith justice he used to contemplate them through the microscope with\r\ngreat attention. At the times of the year when the flowers were in\r\nbloom, and the fruit in perfection, he used to design them in his own\r\ngarden, and the Sieur Gulet and Voorhelm sent him the most beautiful\r\nproductions in those kinds they could pick up.\r\n\r\nHis reputation rose to such a height that all the curious in painting\r\nsought his works with great eagerness, which encouraged him to raise his\r\nprices so high that his pictures at last grew out of the reach of any\r\nbut princes and men of the greatest fortune. He was the first flower\r\npainter that ever thought of laying them on light grounds, which\r\nrequires much greater art than to paint them on dark ones.\r\n\r\nVan Huysum died at Amsterdam in 1749. He never had any pupil but a young\r\nwoman named Haverman, and his brother Michael. Two other brothers have\r\ndistinguished themselves in painting, one named Justus, who painted\r\nbattles, and died at twenty-two years old, the other named James, who\r\nended his days in England in 1740. He copied the pictures of his brother\r\nJohn so well as to deceive the connoisseurs: he had usually £20 for each\r\ncopy. For the originals, it may be noted, from a thousand to fourteen\r\nhundred florins was paid.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nV\r\n\r\nPAINTERS OF LANDSCAPE\r\n\r\n\r\nComing now to the landscape painters we find that JAN VAN GOYEN, born at\r\nLeyden in 1596, was destined to exert a really powerful influence,\r\ninasmuch as he was the founder, as is generally acknowledged, of the\r\nDutch school of homely native landscape. Beginning with figure subjects,\r\nhe discovered in their landscape backgrounds his real _métier_, and\r\nseems only to have realized his great gifts when he looked further into\r\nnature than was possible when painting a foreground picture. He appears\r\nto have been by nature or by inclination long-sighted, and he is never\r\nso happy as when painting distance, either along the banks of a river or\r\nlooking out to sea. This extended gaze taught him something of\r\natmosphere that few painters beside himself ever acquired, and helped\r\nhim to the mastery of tone which appears to have influenced so many of\r\nhis followers, as for example Van de Velde in the painting of\r\nsea-pieces.\r\n\r\nJAN WYNANTS, born at Haarlem about 1620, and still living in 1677, was\r\nthe first master who applied all the developed qualities of the Dutch\r\nSchool to the treatment of landscape painting. In general his prevailing\r\ntone is clear and bright, more especially in the green of his trees and\r\nplants, which in many cases, merges into blue. One of his\r\ncharacteristics is a fallen tree trunk in the foreground, as may be seen\r\nin three out of the six examples in the National Gallery. The\r\ncarefulness of his execution explains how it was that in so long a life\r\nhe only produced a moderate number of pictures. Smith's catalogue\r\ncontains about 214. These differ much according to their different\r\nperiods. In his first manner peasants' cottages or ruins play an\r\nimportant part, and the view is more or less shut in by trees of a heavy\r\ndark green, the execution solid and careful. In his middle time he\r\ngenerally paints open views of a rather uneven country, diversified by\r\nwood and water. That Wynants retained his full skill even in advanced\r\nlife is proved by a picture dated 1672, in the Munich Gallery,\r\nrepresenting a road leading to a fenced wood and a sandhill, near which\r\nin the foreground are some cows (by Lingelbach) being driven along. In\r\nhis last manner a heavy uniformly brown tone is often observable.\r\n\r\nIt is his genuine feeling for nature that makes Wynant's pictures so\r\npopular in England, where we meet with a considerable number of his best\r\nworks.\r\n\r\nJACOB RUISDAEL (born at Haarlem 1628, died there 1682) is supposed to\r\nhave developed under the influence of a school there that was opposing\r\nVan Goyen's tone treatment by local colour. Though not always the most\r\ncharming, Ruisdael is certainly the greatest and the most profound of\r\nthe Dutch landscape painters. His wide expanses of sky, earth or sea,\r\nwith their tender gradations of aërial perspective, diversified here and\r\nthere by alternations of sunshine and shadow, attract us as much by the\r\npathos as by the picturesqueness of their character. His scenes of\r\nmountainous districts with foaming waterfalls; or bare piles of rock and\r\nsombre lakes are imbued with a feeling of melancholy. Ruisdael's work\r\nmay be well studied in the six examples at Hertford House, and the\r\nfourteen in the National Gallery. Among his finer works in Continental\r\ncollections the following are some of those selected by Kugler for\r\ndescription. At the Hague is one of his wide expanses--a view of the\r\ncountry around Haarlem, the town itself looking small on the horizon,\r\nunder a lofty expanse of cloudy sky in the foreground a bleaching-ground\r\nand some houses reminding us, by the manner in which they are\r\nintroduced, of Hobbema. The prevailing tone is cool, the sky singularly\r\nbeautiful, and the execution wonderfully delicate. A flat country with a\r\nroad leading to a village, and fields with wheatsheaves, is in the\r\nDresden Gallery. This is temperate in colouring and beautifully lighted.\r\nEqually fine is an extensive view over a hilly but bare country, through\r\nwhich a river runs; in the Louvre. The horseman and beggar on a bridge\r\nare by Wouvermans: here the grey-greenish harmony of the tone is in fine\r\naccordance with the poetic grandeur of the subject. A hill covered with\r\noak woods, with a peasant hastening to a hut to escape the gathering\r\nshower, is in the Munich Gallery. The golden warmth of the trees and\r\nground, and the contrast between the deep clear chiaroscuro and soft\r\nrain-clouds, and the bright gleam of sunshine, render this picture one\r\nof the finest by this master.\r\n\r\nThe peculiar charm which is seen in Holland by the combination of lofty\r\ntrees and calm water is fully represented in the following works:--_The\r\nChase_; in the Dresden Gallery. Here in the still water in the\r\nforeground--through which a stag-hunt (by Adrian van de Velde) is\r\npassing--clouds, warm with morning sunlight, appear reflected. In this\r\npicture, remarkable as it is for size, being 3 ft. 10-1/2 in. high, by 5\r\nft. 2 in. wide, the sense even of the fresh morning is not without a\r\ntinge of gentle melancholy. A noble wood of oaks, beeches and elms,\r\nabout the size of the last-mentioned picture, is in the Louvre. In the\r\ncentre, through an opening in the woods, are seen distant hills. The\r\ncattle and figures upon a flooded road are by Berchem. In power, warmth,\r\nand treatment, this is also nearly allied to the preceding work. Of his\r\nwaterfalls, the most remarkable are--A picture at the Hague, which is\r\nparticularly striking for its warm lighting, and careful execution.\r\nAnother with Bentheim Castle, so often repeated by Ruisdael, is at\r\nAmsterdam. In the same collection is a landscape, with rocks, woods, and\r\na larger waterfall. This has a grandly poetic character which, with the\r\nbroad and solid handling, plainly shows the influence of Everdingen. The\r\nsame remark may be applied to the waterfall, No. 328, in the Munich\r\nGallery. Here the dark, rainy sky, enhances the sublime impression made\r\nby the foaming torrent that rushes down the rocky masses. Another work\r\nworthy to rank with the fore-going is _The Jewish Cemetry_, in the\r\nDresden Gallery: a pallid sunbeam lights up some of the tombstones,\r\nbetween which a torrent impetuously flows.\r\n\r\nThe _Landscape with Waterfall_ at Hertford House is a good example; the\r\n_Landscape with a Farm_ in the same collection is another, though in\r\nthis the figures and cattle are by Adrian Van der Velde. Ostade and\r\nWouverman are also said to have helped him with his figures, and it is\r\npossible that one or other of them ought to have some of the credit for\r\nthe beautiful _View on the Shore at Scheveningen_ in the National\r\nGallery (No. 1390). The _Landscape with Ruins_ (No. 746) is perhaps the\r\nfinest of the others there.\r\n\r\nWILLEM VAN DE VELDE, the younger, born at Amsterdam 1633, died at\r\nGreenwich 1707. His first master was his father, Willem van de Velde the\r\nelder, but his principal instructor was Simon de Vlieger. The earlier\r\npart of his professional life was spent in Holland, where, besides\r\nnumerous pictures of the various aspects of marine scenery, he painted\r\nseveral well-known sea-fights in which the Dutch had obtained the\r\nvictory over the English. He afterwards followed his father to England,\r\nwhere he was greatly patronized by Charles II. and James II. for whom,\r\nin turn, he painted the naval victories of the English over the Dutch.\r\nHe was also much employed by amateurs of art among the English nobility\r\nand gentry. There is no question that Willem van de Velde the younger is\r\nthe greatest marine painter of the whole Dutch School. His perfect\r\nknowledge of lineal and aërial perspective, and the incomparable\r\ntechnique which he inherited from his school, enabled him to represent\r\nthe sea and the sky with the utmost truth of form, atmosphere and\r\ncolour, and to enliven the scene with the purest feeling for the\r\npicturesque, with the most natural incidents of sea-faring life.\r\n\r\nTwo of his pictures at Amsterdam are particularly remarkable;\r\nrepresenting the English flagship _The Prince Royal_ striking her\r\ncolours in the fight with the Dutch fleet of 1666; and its companion,\r\nfour English men-of-war brought in as prizes at the same fight. Here the\r\npainter has represented himself in a small boat, from which he actually\r\nwitnessed the battle. This accounts for the extraordinary truth with\r\nwhich every particular of the scene is rendered in such small pictures,\r\nwhich, combined with their delicate greyish tone, and the mastery of the\r\nexecution, render them two of his finest works. A view of the city of\r\nAmsterdam, dated 1686, taken from the river, is an especially good\r\nspecimen of his large pictures. It is about 5 ft. high by 10 ft. wide.\r\nThe vessels in the river are arranged with great feeling for the\r\npicturesque, and the treatment of details is admirable. His greatest\r\nsuccesses, however, are in the representation of calm seas, as may be\r\nseen in a small picture at Munich. In the centre of the middle distance\r\nis a frigate, and in the foreground smaller vessels. The fine silvery\r\ntone in which the whole is kept finds a sufficient counter-balance of\r\ncolour in the yellowish sun-lit clouds, and in the brownish vessels and\r\ntheir sails. Nothing can be more exquisite than the tender reflections\r\nof these in the water. Of almost similar beauty is a picture of about\r\nthe same size, with four vessels, in the Cassel Gallery, which is signed\r\nand dated 1653. As a contrast to this class of works, may be mentioned\r\n_The Gathering Tempest_, in the Munich Gallery. This is brilliantly\r\nlighted, and of great delicacy of tone in the distance, though the\r\nforeground has somewhat darkened.\r\n\r\nMEINDERT HOBBEMA (1638-1709) was a friend as well as a pupil of Jacob\r\nRuisdael. The fact that such distinguished painters as Adrian van de\r\nVelde, Wouvermans, Berchem, and Lingelbach, executed the figures and\r\nanimals in his pictures proves the esteem in which he was held by his\r\ncontemporaries; nevertheless it is evident that the public was slow in\r\nconceding to him the rank which he deserved, for his name is not found\r\nfor more than a century after his death in any even of the most\r\nelaborate dictionaries of art, while the catalogues of the most\r\nimportant picture sales in Holland make no mention of him at all up to\r\nthe year 1739; when a picture by him, although much extolled, was sold\r\nfor only 71 florins, and even in 1768 one of his masterpieces only\r\nfetched 300 florins. The English were the first to discover his merits.\r\n\r\nThe peculiar characteristics of this master, who next to Ruisdael, is\r\nconfessedly at the head of landscape painters of the Dutch School, will\r\nbe best appreciated by comparing him with his rival. In two most\r\nimportant qualities--fertility of inventive genius, and poetry of\r\nfeeling--he is decidedly inferior: the range of his subjects being far\r\nnarrower. His most frequent scenes are villages surrounded by trees,\r\nsuch as are frequently met with in the districts of Guelderland, with\r\nwinding pathways leading from house to house. A water-mill occasionally\r\nforms a prominent feature. Often, too, he represents a slightly uneven\r\ncountry, diversified by groups or rows of trees, wheat-fields, meadows,\r\nand small pools. Occasionally he gives us a view of part of a town, with\r\nits gates, canals with sluices, and quays with houses; more rarely, the\r\nruins of an old castle, with an extensive view of a flat country, or\r\nsome stately residence. In the composition of all these pictures,\r\nhowever, we do not find that elevated and picturesque taste which\r\ncharacterises Ruisdael; on the contrary they have a thoroughly\r\nportrait-like appearance, decidedly prosaic, but always surprizingly\r\ntruthful. The greater number of Hobbema's pictures are as much\r\ncharacterized by a warm and golden tone as those of Ruisdael by the\r\nreverse; his greens being yellowish in the lights and brownish in the\r\nshadows--both of singular transparency. In pictures of this kind the\r\ninfluence of Rembrandt is perhaps perceptible, and they are superior in\r\nbrilliancy to any work by Ruisdael. While these works chiefly present us\r\nwith the season of harvest and sunset-light, there are others in a cool,\r\nsilvery, morning lighting, and with the bright green of spring, that\r\nsurpass Ruisdael's in clearness. His woods also, owing to the various\r\nlights that fall on them, are of greater transparency.\r\n\r\nAs almost all the galleries on the Continent were formed at a period\r\nwhen the works of Hobbema were little prized (Ticcozzi's _Dictionary_,\r\nin 1818, does not include his name), they either possess no specimens,\r\nor some of an inferior class, so that no adequate idea can be formed of\r\nhim. The most characteristic example to be met with on the Continent is\r\na landscape in the Berlin Museum, No. 886, an oak wood, with scattered\r\nlights, a calm piece of water in the foreground, and a sun-lit village\r\nin the distance. Of the eight pictures in the National Gallery from his\r\nhand, most are good, and one world-famous--_The Avenue, Middelharnis_,\r\nwhich may be called his masterpiece. This was painted in 1689, when he\r\nhad reached the age of fifty. His diploma picture, painted in 1663, is\r\nat Hertford House, together with four other interesting examples, all of\r\nwhich repay careful study.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nGERMAN SCHOOLS\r\n\r\n\r\nThe origins of the German Schools of painting are obscure, but it is\r\nfairly certain that Cologne was the first place in which the art was\r\nsoonest established to any considerable extent. Here, as in the\r\nNetherlands, we cannot find any traces of immediate Italian influences.\r\nThe first painter who can be identified with any certainty is WILHELM\r\nVON HERLE, called MEISTER WILHELM, whose activity is not traceable\r\nearlier than about 1358. Most of the pictures formerly attributed to him\r\nhave, however, been assigned to his pupil HERMANN WYNRICH VON WESEL, who\r\non the death of his master in 1378 married his widow and continued his\r\npractice, until his death somewhere about 1414. His most important works\r\nwere six panels of the High Altar of the Cathedral, the so-called\r\n_Madonna of the Pea Blossoms_ and two _Crucifixions_ at Cologne, and the\r\n_S. Veronica_ at Munich, dated 1410.\r\n\r\nMore important was STEPHEN LOCHNER, who died at Cologne in 1451. His\r\ninfluence was widespread and his school apparently numerous, until, in\r\n1450, Roger van der Weyden, returning from Italy, stopped at Cologne and\r\npainted his large triptych, which eclipsed Lochner. From this time\r\nonwards the school of Cologne is represented by painters whose names are\r\nnot known, and who are accordingly distinguished by the subjects of\r\ntheir works; such as _The Master of the Glorification of the Virgin_,\r\n_The Master of S. Bartholomew_, etc., until we come to Bartel Bruyn\r\n(_c._ 1493-1553), a portrait painter who is represented at Berlin, and\r\nby a picture of Dr Fuchsius bequeathed to the National Gallery by George\r\nSalting.\r\n\r\nIn other parts of Germany, particularly in Nuremberg, Ulm, Augsburg, and\r\nBasle, various names of painters of the latter half of the fourteenth\r\ncentury have survived, but their works are of little interest except to\r\nthe connoisseur as showing the influence under which the two great\r\nartists of the sixteenth century, Albert Dürer and Hans Holbein, and one\r\nor two lesser lights like Lucas Cranach, Albert Altdorfer, and Adam\r\nElsheimer, were formed.\r\n\r\nIn Germany the taste for the fantastic in art peculiar to the Middle\r\nAges, though it engendered clever and spirited works such as those of\r\nQuentin Massys and Lucas van Leyden, was still unfavourable to the\r\ncultivation of pure beauty, scenes from the Apocalypse, Dances of Death,\r\netc., being among the favourite subjects for art. On the other hand, the\r\npictorial treatment of antique literature, a world so suggestive of\r\nbeautiful forms, was so little comprehended by the German mind that they\r\nonly sought to express it through the medium of those fantastic ideas\r\nwith very childish and even tasteless results. We must also remember\r\nthat that average education of the various classes of society which the\r\nfine arts require for their protection stood on a very low footing in\r\nGermany. In Italy the favour with which works of art was regarded was\r\nfar more widely extended. This again gave rise to a more elevated\r\npersonal position on the part of the artist, which in Italy was not only\r\none of more consideration, but of incomparably greater independence. In\r\nthis latter respect Germany was so\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PLATE XXXII.\r\n\r\n\"THE MASTER OF ST BARTHOLOMEW\"\r\n\r\nTWO SAINTS\r\n\r\n_National Gallery, London_]\r\n\r\ndeficient that the genius of Albert Dürer and Holbein was miserably\r\ncramped and hindered in development by the poverty and littleness of\r\nsurrounding circumstances. It is known that of all the German princes no\r\none but the Elector Frederick the Wise ever gave Albert Dürer a\r\ncommission for pictures, while a writing addressed by the great painter\r\nto the magistracy of Nuremberg tells us that his native city never gave\r\nhim employment even to the value of 500 florins. At the same time his\r\npictures were so meanly paid, that for the means of subsistence, as he\r\nsays himself, he was compelled to devote himself to engraving. How far\r\nmore such a man as Dürer would have been appreciated in Italy or in the\r\nNetherlands is further evidenced in the above-mentioned writing, where\r\nhe states that he was offered 200 ducats a year in Venice and 300\r\nPhilips-gulden in Antwerp, if he would settle in either of those cities.\r\nAnd Holbein fared still worse: there is no evidence whatever that any\r\nGerman prince ever troubled himself at all about the great painter while\r\nat Basle, and his art was so little cared for that necessity compelled\r\nhim to go to England, where a genius fitted for the highest undertakings\r\nof historical painting was limited to the sphere of portraiture. The\r\ncrowning impediments finally, which hindered the progress of German art,\r\nand perverted it from its true aim, were the Reformation, which narrowed\r\nthe sphere of ecclesiastical works, and the pernicious imitation of the\r\ngreat Italian masters which ensued.\r\n\r\nLUCAS CRANACH, born in 1472, received his first instructions in art from\r\nhis father, his later teaching probably from Matthew Grunewald. In some\r\ninstances he attained to the expression of dignity, earnestness and\r\nfeeling, but generally his characteristics are a naïve and childlike\r\ncheerfulness and a gentle and almost timid grace. The impression\r\nproduced by his style of representation reminds one of the \"Volksbücher\"\r\nand \"Volkslieder.\" Many of his church pictures have a very peculiar\r\nsignificance: in these he stands forth properly speaking as the painter\r\nof the Reformation. Intimate both with Luther and Melanchthon, he seizes\r\non the central aim of their doctrine, viz., the insufficiency of good\r\nworks and the sole efficacy of faith. His mythological subjects appeal\r\ndirectly to the eye like real portraits; and sometimes also by means of\r\na certain grace and naïveté of motive. We may cite as an instance the\r\nDiana seated on a stag in a small picture at Berlin, No. 564. _The\r\nFountain of Youth_, also at Berlin, No. 593, is a picture of peculiar\r\ncharacter; a large basin surrounded by steps and with a richly adorned\r\nfountain forms the centre. On one side, where the country is stony and\r\nbarren, a multitude of old women are dragged forward on horses, waggons\r\nor carriages, and with much trouble are got into the water. On the other\r\nside of the fountain they appear as young maidens splashing about and\r\namusing themselves with all kinds of playful mischief; close by is a\r\nlarge pavilion into which a herald courteously invites them to enter and\r\nwhere they are arrayed in costly apparel. A feast is prepared in a\r\nsmiling meadow, which seems to be followed by a dance; the gay crowd\r\nloses itself in a neighbouring grove. The men unfortunately have not\r\nbecome young, and retain their grey beards. The picture is of the year\r\n1546, the seventy-fourth of Cranach's age.\r\n\r\nALBERT ALTDORFER was born 1488 at Altdorf, near Landshuth, in Bavaria,\r\nand settled at Ratisbon, where he died 1528. He invested the fantastic\r\ntendency of the time with a poetic feeling--especially in\r\nlandscape--and he developed it so as to attain a perfection in this\r\nsort of romantic painting that no other artist had reached. In his later\r\nperiod he was strongly influenced by Italian art. Altdorfer's principal\r\nwork is in the Munich Gallery, and is thus described by Schlegel:--\r\n\r\n\"It represents the Victory of Alexander the Great over Darius; the\r\ncostume is that of the artist's own day, as it would be treated in the\r\nchivalrous poems of the middle ages--man and horse are sheathed in plate\r\nand mail, with surcoats of gold or embroidery; the chamfrons upon the\r\nheads of the horses, the glittering lances and stirrups, and the variety\r\nof the weapons, form altogether a scene of indescribable splendour and\r\nrichness.... It is, in truth, a little world on a few square feet of\r\ncanvas; the hosts of combatants who advance on all sides against each\r\nother are innumerable, and the view into the background appears\r\ninterminable. In the distance is the ocean, with high rocks and a rugged\r\nisland between them; ships of war appear in the offing and a whole fleet\r\nof vessels--on the left the moon is setting--on the right the sun\r\nrising--both shining through the opening clouds--a clear and striking\r\nimage of the events represented. The armies are arranged in rank and\r\ncolumn without the strange attitudes, contrasts, and distortions\r\ngenerally exhibited in so-called battle-pieces. How indeed would this\r\nhave been possible with such a vast multitude of figures? The whole is\r\nin the plain and severe, or it may be the stiff manner of the old style.\r\nAt the same time the character and execution of these little figures is\r\nmost masterly and profound. And what variety, what expression there is,\r\nnot merely in the character of the single warriors and knights, but in\r\nthe hosts themselves! Here crowds of black archers rush down troop after\r\ntroop from the mountain with the rage of a foaming torrent; on the\r\nother side high upon the rocks in the far distance a scattered crowd of\r\nflying men are turning round in a defile. The point of the greatest\r\ninterest stands out brilliantly from the centre of the whole--Alexander\r\nand Darius both in armour of burnished gold; Alexander on Bucephalus\r\nwith his lance in rest advances before his men and presses on the flying\r\nDarius, whose charioteer has already fallen on his white horses, and who\r\nlooks back upon his conqueror with all the despair of a vanquished\r\nmonarch.\"\r\n\r\nALBERT DÜRER (1471-1528), by his overpowering genius, may be called the\r\nsole representative of German art of his period. He was gifted with a\r\npower of conception which traced nature through all her finest shades,\r\nand with a lively sense, as well for the solemn and the sublime, as for\r\nsimple grace and tenderness; above all, he had an earnest and truthful\r\nfeeling in art united with a capacity for the most earnest study. These\r\nqualities were sufficient to place him by the side of the greatest\r\nartists whom the world has ever seen.\r\n\r\nOne of the earliest portraits by Albert Dürer known to us is that of his\r\nfather, Albert Dürer, the goldsmith, dated 1497, in our National\r\nGallery. In the year 1644, another version of this picture, which was\r\nengraved by Hollar, was in the collection of the Earl of Arundel, and is\r\nnow in that of the Duke of Northumberland, at Syon House. Of about the\r\nsame time--that is to say, before 1500--are the portraits of Oswald\r\nKrell, at Munich, of Frederick the Wise, at Berlin, and of himself, at\r\nthe Prado.\r\n\r\nSeveral of Albert Dürer's pictures of the year 1500 are known to us. The\r\nfirst and most important is his own portrait in the Munich Gallery,\r\nwhich represents him full face with his hand laid on the fur trimming\r\nof his robe.\r\n\r\nHis finest picture of the year 1504 is an _Adoration of the Kings_,\r\noriginally painted for Frederick the Wise, Elector of Saxony,\r\nsubsequently presented by the Elector Christian II. to the Emperor\r\nRudolph II., and finally, on the occasion of an exchange of pictures,\r\ntransferred from Vienna to Florence, where it now hangs in the Tribune\r\nof the Uffizi. The heads are of thoroughly realistic treatment; the\r\nVirgin a portrait from some model of no attractive character; the second\r\nKing a portrait of the painter himself. The landscape background exactly\r\nresembles that in the well-known engraving of S. Eustace, the period of\r\nwhich is thus pretty nearly defined. It is carefully painted in a fine\r\nbody of colour.\r\n\r\nIn 1505 Dürer made a second journey into Upper Italy, and remained a\r\nconsiderable time at Venice. Of his occupations in this city the letters\r\nwritten to his friend Wilibald Pirckheimer which have come down to us\r\ngive many interesting particulars. He there executed for the German\r\nCompany a picture known as _The Feast of Rose Garlands_, which brought\r\nhim great fame, and by its brilliant colouring silenced the assertion of\r\nhis envious adversaries \"that he was a good engraver, but knew not how\r\nto deal with colours.\" In the centre of a landscape is the Virgin seated\r\nwith the Child and crowned by two angels; on her right is a Pope with\r\npriests kneeling; on her left the Emperor Maximilian I. with knights;\r\nvarious members of the German Company are also kneeling; all are being\r\ncrowned with garlands of roses by the Virgin, the Child, S.\r\nDominick--who stands behind the Virgin--and by angels. The painter and\r\nhis friend Pirckheimer are seen standing in the background on the\r\nright; the painter holds a tablet with the inscription, \"Albertus Dürer\r\nGermanus, MDVI.\" This picture, which is one of his largest and finest,\r\nwas purchased from the church at a high price by the Emperor Rudolph II.\r\nfor his gallery at Prague, where it remained until sold in 1782 by the\r\nEmperor Joseph II. It then became the property of the Præmonstratensian\r\nmonastery of Stratow at Prague, where it still exists, though in very\r\ninjured condition and greatly over-painted. In the Imperial Gallery at\r\nVienna may be seen an old copy which conveys a better idea of the\r\npicture than the original.\r\n\r\nWith these productions begins the zenith of this master's fame, in which\r\na great number of works follow one another within a short period. Of\r\nthese we first notice a picture of 1508, in the Imperial Gallery at\r\nVienna, painted for Duke Frederick of Saxony, and which afterwards\r\nadorned the gallery of the Emperor Rudolph II. It represents _The\r\nMartyrdom of the Ten Thousand Saints_. In the centre of the picture\r\nstand the master and his friend Pirckheimer as spectators, both in black\r\ndresses. Dürer has a mantle thrown over his shoulder in the Italian\r\nfashion, and stands in a firm attitude. He folds his hands and holds a\r\nsmall flag, on which is inscribed, \"Iste faciebat anno domini 1508\r\nAlbertus Dürer Alemanus.\" There are a multitude of single groups\r\nexhibiting every species of martyrdom, but there is a want of general\r\nconnection of the whole. The scenes in the background, where the\r\nChristians are led naked up the rocks, and are precipitated down from\r\nthe top, are particularly excellent. The whole is very minute and\r\nminiature-like; the colouring is beautifully brilliant, and it is\r\npainted (the accessories particularly) with extraordinary care.\r\n\r\nTo 1511 belongs also one of his most celebrated pictures, _The Adoration\r\nof the Trinity_, which is also at Vienna, painted for the chapel of the\r\nLandauer Brüderhaus in Nuremberg. Above in the centre of the picture are\r\nseen the First Person, who holds the Saviour in his arms, while the Holy\r\nSpirit is seen above; some angels spread out the priestly mantle of the\r\nAlmighty, whilst others hover near with the instruments of Christ's\r\npassion. On the left hand a little lower down is a choir of females with\r\nthe Virgin at their head; on the right are the male saints with St John\r\nthe Baptist. Below all these kneel a host of the blessed of all ranks\r\nand nations extending over the whole of this part of the picture.\r\nUnderneath the whole is a beautiful landscape, and in a corner of the\r\npicture the artist himself richly clothed in a fur mantle, with a tablet\r\nnext him with the words, \"Albertus Dürer Noricus faciebat anno a\r\nVirginis partu, 1511.\" It may be assumed beyond doubt that he held in\r\nparticular esteem those pictures into which he introduced his own\r\nportrait.\r\n\r\nIn the Vienna Gallery is also a picture of the year 1512, the Virgin\r\nholding the naked Child in her arms. She has a veil over her head and\r\nblue drapery. Her face is of the form usual with Albert Dürer, but of a\r\nsoft and maidenly character; the Child is beautiful--the countenance\r\nparticularly so. It is painted with exceeding delicacy of finish.\r\n\r\nTwo altar-pieces of his earliest period must be mentioned. One is in the\r\nDresden Gallery, consisting of three pictures painted in tempera on\r\ncanvas, representing the Virgin, S. Anthony, and S. Sebastian\r\nrespectively. Although this is probably one of his very earliest works,\r\nit is remarkable for the novelty of its treatment and its independence\r\nof tradition.\r\n\r\nThe other, a little later, is in the Munich Gallery (Nos. 240-3),\r\npainted at the request of the Paumgartner family, for S. Catherine's\r\nChurch at Nuremberg, was brought to Munich in 1612 by Maximilian I. The\r\nsubject of the middle picture is the Nativity; the Child is in the\r\ncentre, surrounded by little angels, whilst the Virgin and Joseph kneel\r\nat the side. The wings contain portraits of the two donors under the\r\nform of S. George and S. Eustace represented as knights in steel armour,\r\neach with his standard, and the former holding the slain dragon.\r\n\r\nThe year 1526 was distinguished by the two pictures of the four\r\nApostles: John and Peter, Mark and Paul; the figures are the size of\r\nlife. These, which are the master's grandest work, and the last of\r\nimportance executed by him, are now in the Munich Gallery. We know with\r\ncertainty that they were presented by Albert Dürer himself to the\r\ncouncil of his native city in remembrance of his career as an artist,\r\nand at the same time as conveying to his fellow-citizens an earnest and\r\nlasting exhortation suited to that stormy period. In the year 1627,\r\nhowever, the pictures were allowed to pass into the hands of the Elector\r\nMaximilian I. of Bavaria. The inscriptions selected by the painter\r\nhimself might have given offence to a Catholic prince, and were\r\ntherefore cut off and joined to the copies by John Fischer, which were\r\nintended to indemnify the city of Nuremberg for the loss of the\r\noriginals. These copies are still in the collection of the Landauer\r\nBrüderhaus at Nuremberg.\r\n\r\nThese pictures are the fruit of the deepest thought which then stirred\r\nthe mind of Albert Dürer, and are executed with overpowering force.\r\nFinished as they are, they form the first complete work of art produced\r\nby Protestantism. As the inscription taken from the Gospels and\r\nEpistles of the Apostles contains pressing warnings not to swerve from\r\nthe word of God, nor to believe in the doctrines of false prophets, so\r\nthe figures themselves represent the steadfast and faithful guardians of\r\nthat holy Scripture which they bear in their hands. There is also an old\r\ntradition, handed down from the master's own times, that these figures\r\nrepresent the four temperaments. This is confirmed by the pictures\r\nthemselves; and though at first sight it may appear to rest on a mere\r\naccidental combination, it serves to carry out more completely the\r\nartist's thought, and gives to the figures greater individuality. It\r\nshows how every quality of the human mind may be called into the service\r\nof the Divine Word. Thus in the first picture, we see the whole force of\r\nthe mind absorbed in contemplation, and we are taught that true\r\nwatchfulness in behalf of the Scripture must begin by devotion to its\r\nstudy.\r\n\r\nS. John stands in front, the open book in his hand; his high forehead\r\nand his whole countenance bear the impress of earnest and deep thought.\r\nThis is the melancholic temperament, which does not shrink from the most\r\nprofound inquiry. Behind him S. Peter bends over the book, and gazes\r\nearnestly at its contents--a hoary head, full of meditative repose. This\r\nfigure represents the phlegmatic temperament, which reviews its own\r\nthoughts in tranquil reflection. The second picture shows the outward\r\noperation of the conviction thus attained and its relation to daily\r\nlife. S. Mark in the background is the man of sanguine temperament; he\r\nlooks boldly round, and appears to speak to his hearers with animation,\r\nearnestly urging them to share those advantages which he has himself\r\nderived from the Holy Scriptures. S. Paul, on the contrary, in the\r\nforeground, holds the book and sword in his hands; he looks angrily and\r\nseverely over his shoulder, ready to defend the Word, and to annihilate\r\nthe blasphemer with the sword of God's power. He is the representative\r\nof the choleric temperament.\r\n\r\nWe know of no important work of a later date than that just described.\r\nHis portrait in a woodcut of the year 1527 represents him earnest and\r\nserious in demeanour, as would naturally follow from his advancing age\r\nand the pressure of eventful times. His head is no longer adorned with\r\nthose richly flowing locks, on which in his earlier days he had set so\r\nhigh a value, as we learn from his pictures and from jests still\r\nrecorded of him. With the departure of Hans Holbein to England in 1528\r\nand the death of Albert Dürer in the same year, that excellence to which\r\nthey had raised German art passed away, and centuries saw no sign of its\r\nrevival.\r\n\r\nOf HANS HOLBEIN, born at Augsburg in 1498, we shall have more to say in\r\na later chapter, when considering the origins of English portraiture.\r\nBut as in the case of Van Dyck, and in fact of every great portrait\r\npainter, his excellence in this particular branch of his art was but one\r\nresult of his being a born artist and first exercising his talents in a\r\nmuch wider field. In Holbein the realistic tendency of the German School\r\nattained its highest development, and he may, next to Dürer, be\r\npronounced the greatest master in it. While Dürer's art exhibits a close\r\naffinity with the religious ideas of the Middle Ages, Holbein appears to\r\nhave been imbued with more modern and more material sentiments, and\r\naccordingly we find him excelling Dürer in closeness and delicacy of\r\nobservation in the delineation of nature. A proof of this is afforded by\r\nthe evidence of Erasmus, who said that as regards the portraits painted\r\nof him by both these artists, that by Holbein was the most like. In\r\nfeeling for beauty of form, also in grace of movement, in colouring, and\r\nin the actual art of painting--in which his father had thoroughly\r\ninstructed him--Holbein is to be placed above Dürer. That he did not\r\nrival the great Italians of his time in \"historical\" painting can only\r\nbe ascribed to the circumstances of his life in Germany, where such\r\nsubjects were not in fashion.\r\n\r\nOf his pictures executed before he left his native country the greater\r\nnumber are at Basle and Augsburg, and are therefore less familiar to the\r\ngeneral public than his later works. A notable exception is the famous\r\n_Meyer Madonna_, the original of which is at Darmstadt, but a version\r\nnow relegated, somewhat harshly, to the \"copyist\" is in the Dresden\r\nGallery, and certainly exhibits as much of the spirit of the master as\r\nwill serve for an example of his powers. It represents the Virgin as\r\nQueen of Heaven, standing in a niche, with the Child in her arms, and\r\nwith the family of the Burgomaster Jacob Meyer of Basle kneeling on\r\neither side of her. With the utmost life and truth to nature, which\r\nbrings these kneeling figures actually into our presence, says Kugler,\r\nthere is combined in a most exquisite degree an expression of great\r\nearnestness, as if the mind were fixed on some lofty object. This is\r\nshown not merely by the introduction of divine beings into the circle of\r\nhuman sympathies, but particularly in the relation so skilfully\r\nindicated between the Holy Virgin and her worshippers, and in her\r\nmanifest desire to communicate to those who are around her the sacred\r\npeace and tranquillity expressed in her own countenance and attitude,\r\nand implied in the infantine grace of the Saviour. In the direct union\r\nof the divine with the human, and in their reciprocal harmony, there is\r\ninvolved a devout and earnest purity of feeling such as only the older\r\nmasters were capable of representing.\r\n\r\nAnother of his most beautiful pictures painted in Germany is the\r\nportrait of Erasmus, dated 1523. This was sent by Erasmus to Sir Thomas\r\nMore, at Chelsea, with a letter recommending Holbein to his care, and as\r\nit is still in this country--in the collection of the Earl of Radnor at\r\nLongford Castle--it is not perhaps too much to hope that it may one of\r\nthese days find its way into the National Gallery--perhaps when the\r\nalterations to the front entrance are completed. This picture has for a\r\nvery long time been regarded as one of Holbein's very finest portraits.\r\nMr W. Barclay Squire, in the sumptuous catalogue of the Radnor\r\ncollection compiled by him, quotes the opinion of Sir William Musgrave,\r\nwritten in 1785, \"I am not sure whether it is not the finest I have\r\nseen\"; and that of Dr Waagen, \"Alone worth a pilgrimage to Longford.\r\nSeldom has a painter so fully succeeded in bringing to view the whole\r\ncharacter of so original a mind as in this instance. In the mouth and\r\nsmall eyes may be seen the unspeakable studies of a long life ... the\r\nface also expresses the sagacity and knowledge of a life gained by long\r\nexperience ... the masterly and careful execution extends to every\r\nportion ... yet the face surpasses everything else in delicacy of\r\nmodelling.\"\r\n\r\nCruel, indeed, was England to have transplanted the one artist who might\r\nhave saved Germany from the artistic destitution from which she has\r\nsuffered ever since!\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PLATE XXXIII.--HANS HOLBEIN\r\n\r\nPORTRAIT OF CHRISTINA, DUCHESS OF MILAN\r\n\r\n_National Gallery, London_]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_FRENCH SCHOOL_\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI\r\n\r\nTHE SEVENTEENTH CENTURY\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen we consider the peculiar beauty of the architecture and\r\necclesiastical sculpture in France during the Middle Ages and the period\r\nof the renaissance, and of the enamels, ivories, and other small works\r\nof art, it is wrong to regret that painting was not also practised by\r\nthe French as assiduously as it was in Italy. For there can be no doubt\r\nthat in being confined to one channel the artistic impulses of a people\r\ncut deeper than if dissipated in various directions. We may suppose,\r\nindeed, that if those of the French had found their outlet in painting\r\nalone, we should have pictures of wonderful beauty, of a beauty moreover\r\nof a markedly different kind from that of the Italian or Spanish or\r\nNetherlandish pictures. But on the other hand we should have perhaps\r\nlost the amazing fascination of Chartres, and the delights of Limoges\r\nenamel and ivories.\r\n\r\nAs it happens, the earliest mention to be made of painting in France is\r\nthe arrival of Leonardo da Vinci at Amboise in 1516, whither he had come\r\nfrom Milan in the train of the young king François I. Unfortunately he\r\nwas by this time sixty-four years old, and in less than three years he\r\ndied. At about the same time there was a court painter in the employment\r\nof François--under the official designation of _varlet de\r\nchambre_--named JEHAN CLOUET, who is supposed to have been of Flemish\r\nextraction. Nothing very definite is known about him or his work, but he\r\nhad a son FRANÇOIS CLOUET, who seems to have been born at about the time\r\nof Leonardo's arrival, and who succeeded to his father's office. At the\r\nfuneral of François I. in 1547 he was ordered to make an _effige du dict\r\nfeu roy_, and he continued to be the official court painter to Henri II.\r\n(whose posthumous portrait he was also ordered to paint), François II.,\r\nand Charles IX. He died in 1572. Every portrait of this period is\r\nattributed to him, just as was the case with Holbein in England. Neither\r\nof the two examples at the National Gallery can be safely ascribed to\r\nhim. The little head of the Emperor Charles V., king of Spain, at\r\nHereford House, is identical in style and in dimensions with that of\r\nFrancis I., king of France, in the Museum at Lyons, which is attributed\r\nto Jean Clouet. Both may have been painted when Charles V. passed\r\nthrough Paris in 1539, but whether by Jean or one of his disciples\r\ncannot be said with certainty.\r\n\r\nNot until the very end of the sixteenth century were born Claude Gellée\r\nand Nicholas Poussin, the only two Frenchmen who were painters of\r\nconsiderable importance before the close of the seventeenth. Nor did\r\neither of these two contribute anything to the glory of their country by\r\npractice or by precept within its confines, both of them passing most of\r\ntheir lives and painting their best works in Italy and under Italian\r\ninfluence.\r\n\r\nNICHOLAS POUSSIN was born at Villiers near Les Andelys on the banks of\r\nthe Seine, in 1594, where he studied for some time under Quentin Varin\r\ntill he was eighteen. After this he was in Paris, but in 1624 he went to\r\nRome where he lived with Du Quesnoy. His first success was obtained by\r\nthe execution of two historical pieces which were commissioned by\r\nCardinal Barberini on his return from an Embassy to France. These were\r\n_The Death of Germanicus_ and _The Capture of Jerusalem_. His next works\r\nwere _The Martyrdom of S. Erasmus_, _The Plague at Ashdod_, of which a\r\nreplica is in the National Gallery, and _The Seven Sacraments_ now at\r\nBelvoir Castle. By these he acquired such fame that on his return to\r\nParis in 1640, Louis XIII. appointed him royal painter, and in order to\r\nkeep him at home provided him with apartments in the Tuileries and a\r\nsalary of £120 a year. Within two years, however, Poussin was back in\r\nRome, and after twenty-three years' unbroken success died there in 1665\r\nin his seventy-second year.\r\n\r\nPoussin was a most conscientious painter, devoting himself seriously in\r\nhis earlier years to the study both of the antique and of practical\r\nanatomy. Besides being the intimate friend of Du Quesnoy, he was a\r\ndevout pupil of Domenichino, for whom he had the greatest reverence. It\r\nis not surprising therefore to find in his earlier works, such as the\r\n_Plague at Ashdod_, a certain academic dulness and lack of spontaneity.\r\nHe was not the forerunner of a new epoch, but one of the last upholders\r\nof the old. He was trying to arrest decay, to infuse a healthier spirit\r\ninto a declining art, so that he errs on the side of correctness. The\r\ninfluence of Titian, however, was too strong for him to remain long\r\nwithin the narrowest limits, as may be seen in the _Bacchanalian Dance_,\r\nNo. 62 in the National Gallery, which was probably one of a series\r\npainted for Cardinal Richelieu during the short time that Poussin was in\r\nParis in 1641. In this and in No. 42, the _Bacchanalian Festival_ as\r\nwell as in _The Shepherds in Arcadia_, in the Louvre, we get a\r\nsurprisingly strong reminiscence of Titian, more especially in the\r\nbrown tones of the flesh and the deep blue of the sky.\r\n\r\nAs the result of conscientious study of the human body the figures in\r\nthese pictures are full of life--for correctness of drawing is the first\r\nrequisite of lively painting without which all the others are useless.\r\nThe fact that over two hundred prints have been engraved after his\r\npictures is a proof of his popularity at one time or another, and though\r\nat the present time his reputation is not as widely recognised as in\r\nformer years, it is certainly as high among those whose judgment is\r\nindependent of passing fashions. As evidence of the soundness of his\r\nprinciples, the following is perhaps worth quoting:--\r\n\r\n\"There are nine things in painting,\" Poussin wrote in a letter to M. de\r\nChambrai, the author of a treatise on painting, \"which can never be\r\ntaught and which are essential to that art. To begin with, the subject\r\nof it should be noble, and receive no quality from the person who treats\r\nit; and to give opportunity to the painter to show his talents and his\r\nindustry it must be chosen as capable of receiving the most excellent\r\nform. A painter should begin with disposition (or as we should say,\r\ncomposition), the ornament should follow, their agreement of the parts,\r\nbeauty, grace, spirit, costume, regard to nature and probability; and\r\nabove all, judgment. This last must be in the painter himself and cannot\r\nbe taught. It is the golden bough of Virgil that no one can either find\r\nor pluck unless his lucky star conducts him to it.\"\r\n\r\nGASPAR POUSSIN, whose name was really Gaspard Dughet, was brother-in-law\r\nof Nicholas, and acquired his name from being his pupil. He was nineteen\r\nyears his junior, and survived him by ten years. He was born in Rome of\r\nFrench parents, and died there in 1675, and though he travelled a good\r\ndeal in Italy he never appears to have visited France. His Italian\r\nlandscapes are very beautiful, and we are fortunate in the possession of\r\none which is considered his best, No. 31 in the National Gallery,\r\n_Landscape with Figures_, _Abraham and Isaac_. Scarcely less fine is the\r\n_Calling of Abraham_, No. 1159, especially in the middle and far\r\ndistance. The sacred figures, it may as well be said, are of little\r\nconcern in the compositions, though useful for purposes of identifying\r\nthe pictures.\r\n\r\nCLAUDE GELLÉE, nowadays usually spoken of as Claude, was born at\r\nChamagne in Lorraine in 1600. Accordingly he has been styled Claude\r\nLorraine, le Lorraine, de Lorrain, Lorrain, or Claudio Lorrenese with\r\nwonderful persistency through the ages, though there was no mystery\r\nabout his surname and it would have served just as well. He was brought\r\nup in his father's profession of pastrycook, and in that capacity he\r\nwent to Rome seeking for employment. As it happened he found it in the\r\nhouse of a landscape painter, Agostino Tassi, who had been a pupil of\r\nPaul Bril, and he not only cooked for him but mixed his colours as well,\r\nand soon became his pupil. Later he was studying under a German painter,\r\nGottfried Wals, at Naples. A more important influence on him, however,\r\nwas that of Joachim Sandrart, one of the best of the later German\r\npainters, whom he met in Rome.\r\n\r\nClaude's earliest pictures of any importance were two which were painted\r\nfor Pope Urban VII. in 1639, when he was just upon forty years old.\r\nThese are the _Village Dance_ and the _Seaport_, now in the Louvre. The\r\n_Seaport at Sunset_ and _Narcissus and Echo_ in the National Gallery\r\n(Nos. 5 and 19) are dated 1644--the former on the canvas and the latter\r\non the sketch for it in the _Liber Veritatis_, where it is stated that\r\nit was painted for an English patron.\r\n\r\nThe _Liber Veritatis_, it should be observed, is the title given to a\r\nportfolio of over two hundred drawings in pen and bistre, or Indian ink,\r\nwhich is now in the possession of the Duke of Devonshire. Most of these\r\nwere made from pictures which had been painted, not as sketches or\r\ndesigns preparatory to painting them, and in some instances there are\r\nnotes on the back of them giving the date, purchaser, and other\r\nparticulars relating to them. So great was the vogue for Claude's\r\nlandscapes in England during the eighteenth century that as early as\r\n1730 or 1740 a good many of his drawings, which had been collected by\r\nJonathan Richardson, Dr. Mead and others, were engraved by Arthur Pond\r\nand John Knapton; and in 1777 a series of about two hundred of the Duke\r\nof Devonshire's drawings was published by Alderman Boydell, which had\r\nbeen etched and mezzotinted by Richard Earlom, under the title of _Liber\r\nVeritatis_. This was the model on which Turner founded the publication\r\nof his own sketches under the title of _Liber Studiorum_. Thus, if\r\nClaude exerted little influence on the art of his own country, it can\r\nhardly be said that he exerted none elsewhere, for Turner was by no\r\nmeans the first Englishman to fall under his spell. Richard Wilson, the\r\nfirst English landscape painter, was undoubtedly influenced by him, both\r\nfrom an acquaintance with his drawings in English collections and from\r\nthe study of his works when in Rome.\r\n\r\nIn this connection we may consider the two landscapes, numbered 12 and\r\n14 in the National Gallery Catalogue, as our most important examples by\r\nthis master, for Turner bequeathed to the nation his two most important\r\npictures _The Sun Rising Through a Vapour_ and _Dido Building Carthage_,\r\non condition that they should be hung between these two by Claude. The\r\nCourt of Chancery could annul the condition, but they could not nullify\r\nthe effect of Claude's influence on Turner or alter the judgment of\r\nposterity with regard to the relations of the two painters to each other\r\nand to art in general, and the Director has wisely observed the wishes\r\nof Turner in still hanging the four pictures together, the Court of\r\nChancery notwithstanding. Both of Claude's are inscribed, besides being\r\nsigned and dated, as follows:\r\n\r\n     No. 12. Mariage d'Isaac avec Rebeca, Claudio Gil. inv. Romae 1648.\r\n\r\n     No. 14. La Reine de Saba va trover Salomon. Clavde Gil. inv. faict\r\n     pour son altesse le duc de Buillon à Roma 1648.\r\n\r\nBoth pictures are familiar in various engravings of them, and though the\r\npresent fashion leads many people in other directions, there can be no\r\ndoubt that the appreciation of Claude in this country is never likely to\r\ndie out, and is only waiting for a turn of the wheel to revive with\r\nincreased vigour.\r\n\r\nMeantime, however, France was not entirely destitute of painters, and\r\nthough without Claude, Poussin or Dughet, who preferred to exercise\r\ntheir art in Rome, she anticipated England by over a century in that\r\nmost important step, the foundation of an Academy of Painting. Not many\r\nof the names of its original members ever became famous--as may be said\r\nin our own country--but among them was SEBASTIEN BOURDON (1616-1671),\r\nwhose work was so much admired by Sir Joshua Reynolds. Bourdon, also,\r\nwandered away from France; within four years after the foundation of\r\nthe Academy, namely, in 1652, he went to Stockholm, and was appointed\r\nprincipal painter to Queen Christina. On her abdication, however, in\r\n1663, he returned to Paris, and enjoyed a great success in painting\r\nlandscapes, and historical subjects. _The Return of the Ark from\r\nCaptivity_, No. 64 in the National Gallery Catalogue, was presented by\r\nthat distinguished patron of the arts, Sir George Beaumont, to whom it\r\nwas bequeathed by Sir Joshua Reynolds, as being one of his most\r\ntreasured possessions. \"I cannot quit this subject,\" he writes in the\r\nfourteenth Discourse, alluding to poetry in landscape, \"without\r\nmentioning two examples, which occur to me at present, in which the\r\npoetical style of landscape may be seen happily executed; the one is\r\n_Jacob's Dream_, by Salvator Rosa, and the other, _The Return of the Ark\r\nfrom Captivity_, by Sebastian Bourdon. With whatever dignity those\r\nhistories are presented to us in the language of scripture, this style\r\nof painting possesses the same power of inspiring sentiments of grandeur\r\nand sublimity, and is able to communicate them to subjects which appear\r\nby no means adapted to receive them. A ladder against the sky has no\r\nvery promising appearance of possessing a capacity to excite any heroic\r\nideas, and the Ark in the hands of a second-rate master would have\r\nlittle more effect than a common waggon on the highway; yet those\r\nsubjects are so poetically treated throughout, the parts have such a\r\ncorrespondence with each other, and the whole and every part of the\r\nscene is so visionary, that it is impossible to look at them without\r\nfeeling in some measure the enthusiasm which seems to have inspired the\r\npainters.\"\r\n\r\nEUSTACHE LE SUEUR, born in the same year as Sebastien Bourdon (1616),\r\nwas another of the original members of the Academy, and was employed by\r\nthe King at the Louvre. His most famous work was the decorations of the\r\ncloister at the monastery of La Chartreuse (now in the Louvre) of which\r\nHorace Walpole speaks so ecstatically in the preface to the last volume\r\nof the _Anecdotes of Painting_. \"The last scene of S. Bruno expiring\"\r\n(he writes) \"in which are expressed all the stages of devotion from the\r\nyoungest mind impressed with fear to the composed resignation of the\r\nPrior, is perhaps inferior to no single picture of the greatest master.\r\nIf Raphael died young, so did Le Sueur; the former had seen the antique,\r\nthe latter only prints from Raphael; yet in the Chartreuse, what airs of\r\nheads! What harmony of colouring! What aërial perspective! How Grecian\r\nthe simplicity of architecture and drapery! How diversified a single\r\nquadrangle though the life of a hermit be the only subject, and devotion\r\nthe only pathetic!\"\r\n\r\nPHILIPPE DE CHAMPAIGNE was another of the original members. He was born\r\nat Brussels in 1602, and did not come to Paris till 1621, where he was\r\nsoon afterwards employed in the decoration of the Luxembourg Palace. But\r\nhe was chiefly a portrait painter, his principal works being the fine\r\nfull-length of Cardinal Richelieu, and another of his daughter as a nun\r\nof Port Royal, both of which are in the Louvre. There are four in the\r\nWallace Collection, but perhaps the most familiar to the English public\r\nis the canvas at the National Gallery (No. 798), painted for the Roman\r\nsculptor Mocchi, to make a bust from, with a full face and two profiles\r\nof Richelieu. As a portrait this is exceedingly interesting, the more so\r\nfrom having an inscription over one of the heads, \"de ces deux profiles\r\ncecy est le meilleur.\" The full length of the Cardinal presented by Mr.\r\nCharles Butler in 1895 (No. 1449), is a good example, which cannot\r\nhowever but suffer by juxtaposition with more accomplished works.\r\n\r\nBut it was not until the close of the seventeenth century that portrait\r\npainting in France became anything like a fine art, and even then it did\r\nnot get beyond being formal and magnificent. The two principal exponents\r\nwere HYACINTHE RIGAUD and NICOLAS LARGILLIÈRE, both of whose works have\r\na sort of grandeur but little subtlety or charm.\r\n\r\nRigaud was born in 1659, at Perpignan in the extreme south of France,\r\nand studied at Montpelier in his youth, then at Lyons on his way to\r\nParis--much as a Scottish artist might have studied first at Glasgow,\r\nthen at Birmingham on his way to London. On the advice of Lebrun he\r\ndevoted himself specially to portrait painting, which he did with such\r\nsuccess that in 1700 he was elected a member of the Academy. He painted\r\nLouis XIV. more often than Largillière or any other painter, and in his\r\nlater years (he lived till 1743) Louis XV. his great-grandson. He is\r\nsaid to have shared with Kneller the distinction, such as it may be, of\r\nhaving painted at least five monarchs.\r\n\r\nRigaud is best known in these days by the fine prints after his\r\nportraits by the French engravers. Of his brushwork we are only able to\r\njudge by the two doubtful versions at the National Gallery and the\r\nWallace Collection respectively, of the fine portrait at Versailles of\r\n_Cardinal Fleury_. The group of _Lulli and the Musicians of the French\r\nCourt_, which was purchased for the National Gallery in 1906 is not by\r\nhim, and it is difficult to understand why the public money should have\r\nbeen wasted on it, or at least on the inscription attributing it to\r\nhim.\r\n\r\nNicolas de Largillière was three years older than Rigaud and survived\r\nhim by another three. He was born in Paris in 1656 and died six months\r\nbefore completing his ninetieth year. Early in life he went as a pupil\r\nto Antwerp, under Antoine Goubeau, and he is said to have worked in\r\nEngland as an assistant to Sir Peter Lely during the later years of that\r\nmaster. On his return to France he was received into the Royal\r\nAcademy--in 1686.\r\n\r\nIn the Wallace Collection is an interesting example of his work, the\r\nlarge group of the French Royal Family, in which four living generations\r\nare portrayed and the bronze effigies of two more. Henri IV. and Louis\r\nXIII., the grandfather and father of the reigning monarch, Louis XIV.,\r\nthe Dauphin his son, the Duc de Bourgogne his grandson, and the Duc\r\nd'Anjou, his great-grandson--afterwards Louis XV., are all included in\r\nthis formal group, which is a useful lesson in history as well as in\r\npainting.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nII\r\n\r\nTHE EIGHTEENTH CENTURY\r\n\r\n\r\nANTOINE WATTEAU was born at Valenciennes in 1684, and died near there\r\nabout thirty-seven years later of consumption. Valenciennes really\r\nbelonged to Flanders, and had only lately been annexed to France, so\r\nthat Watteau owed something of his art to Flemish rather than to French\r\nsources. At the same time it cannot be said that his development would\r\nhave been the same if he had gone to Brussels or Antwerp instead of to\r\nParis to study, for though the works of Rubens and Van Dyck were from\r\nhis earliest years his chief attraction, the influence of the French\r\nartist Claude Gillot, as well as that of Audran, the keeper of the\r\nLuxembourg Palace, without doubt exerted a very decided help in\r\ndetermining the future course of his work.\r\n\r\nWhen living with Audran, Watteau had every opportunity for studying the\r\nworks of the older masters, especially those of Rubens, whose\r\ndecorations, executed for Marie de Medici, had not at that time been\r\nremoved to the Louvre. Besides copying from these older pictures,\r\nWatteau was employed by Audran in the execution of designs for wall\r\ndecorations, etc.\r\n\r\nWatteau's two earliest pictures still in existence are supposed to be\r\nthe _Départ de Troupe_ and the _Halte d'Armée_, which were the first of\r\na series of military pictures on a small scale. To an early period also\r\nbelong the _Accordée de Village_, at the Soane Museum in Lincoln's Inn\r\nFields, the _Mariée de Village_ at Potsdam, and the _Wedding\r\nFestivities_ in the Dublin National Gallery.\r\n\r\nIn 1712 other influences began to work upon him. In this year he came\r\ninto contact with Crozat, the famous collector, in whose house he became\r\nfamiliar with a fresh batch of the Flemish and Italian masterpieces. It\r\nwas at this time that he was approved by the Royal Academy, though he\r\ntook five years over his Diploma picture, \"_Embarquement pour l'Île de\r\nCythère_,\" which is now in the Louvre. Meantime the influence of Rubens\r\nand the Italian masters--especially the Venetians, had greatly widened\r\nand deepened his art, and these influences, acting on his peculiarly\r\nsensitive temperament and poetical spirit, had a magical effect,\r\ntransforming the actual scenes of Paris and Versailles, which he painted\r\ninto enchanted places in\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PLATE XXXIV.--ANTOINE WATTEAU\r\n\r\nL'INDIFFÉRENT\r\n\r\n_Louvre, Paris_]\r\n\r\nfairyland, as he transformed the formal actual painting of the period of\r\nLouis XIV. into the romantic school of the eighteenth century in France.\r\nThe setting of the famous pictures in the Wallace Collection, catalogued\r\nas _The Music-Party_ or _Les Charnes de la Vie_ (No. 410), is a view of\r\nthe Champs Elysées taken from the gallery of the Tuileries. Who would\r\nhave thought it? And what does it matter, except to show how entirely\r\nWatteau revolutionized the pompous and prosaic methods of his time by\r\ninvesting the actual with poetry and romance.\r\n\r\nTwo other pictures at Hertford House, Nos. 389 and 391, were painted in\r\nthe Champs Elysées, and the figures are, for the most part, the same in\r\nboth, all three of these pictures are fine examples of the artist's\r\npower of broad and spirited treatment, combined with extreme delicacy\r\nand refinement of conception.\r\n\r\nThree other pictures at Hertford House are equally delightful examples\r\nof another class of subject, namely groups of figures dressed in the\r\nparts of actors in Italian comedy. From a note in the Catalogue we learn\r\nthat a company of Italian comedians were in Paris in the sixteenth\r\ncentury, but were banished by Louis Quatorze in 1697 for a supposed\r\naffront to Madame de Maintenon. In 1716, however, they were recalled by\r\nthe Regent, the Duc d'Orléans, and became once more the delight of\r\nParis. Several of the figures in the Italian comedy had already passed\r\ninto French popular drama, and in Watteau's time there seems to have\r\nbeen a fluctuating company, according as one actor or actress or another\r\ndeveloped a part, and to Pantalone, Arlecchino, Dottore and Columbina\r\nwere now added Pierrot--or Gilles--Mezetin, a sort of double of Pierrot,\r\nScaramouche and Scapin. The vague web of courtship, dalliance, intrigue\r\nand jealousy called up by these characters attracted Watteau to employ\r\nthem in his compositions, and to make them also the medium of the more\r\nsincere sentiments of conjugal love and friendship,--as in _The Music\r\nLesson_, _Gilles and his Family_ and _Harlequin and Columbine_, at\r\nHertford House. All of these three were engraved in Watteau's life-time\r\nor shortly after his death, and the verses sub-joined to the engravings\r\nare a charming rendering of the sentiment underlying the pictures.\r\n\r\nIn _The Music Lesson_ we see the half length figures of a lady, seated,\r\nreading a music book, and of a man playing a lute opposite to her.\r\nAnother man looks at the book over the lady's shoulder, and two little\r\nchildren's faces appear at her knee. The verses are as follows:--\r\n\r\n    Pour nous prouver que cette belle\r\n    Trouve l'hymen un noeud fort doux\r\n    Le peintre nous la peint fidelle\r\n    À suivre le ton d'un Époux.\r\n\r\n    Les enfants qui sont autour d'elle\r\n    Sont les fruits de son tendre amour\r\n    Dont ce beau joueur de prunelle\r\n    Pouvait bien goûter quelque jour.\r\n\r\nIn _Gilles and his Family_ we have a three-quarter length full-face\r\nportrait of le Sieur de Sirois, a friend of Watteau, with these verses\r\nunder the engraving:--\r\n\r\n    Sous un habit de mezzetin\r\n    Ce gros brun au riant visage\r\n    Sur la guitarre avec sa main\r\n    Fait un aimable badinage.\r\n\r\n    Par les doux accords de sa voix\r\n    Enfants d'une bouche vermeille\r\n    Du beau sexe tant à la fois\r\n    Il charme les yeux et l'oreille.\r\n\r\nIn the little _Lady at her Toilet_ (No. 439) we see the influence of\r\nPaul Veronese, though it is probable that this was not painted until he\r\nvisited London in the later part of his short life. For there is a\r\nsimilar piece called _La Toilette du Matin_ which was engraved by a\r\nFrench artist who had settled in England, Philip Mercier, and on whose\r\nwork the influence of Watteau is very noticeable.\r\n\r\n_Le Rendez-vous de Chasse_ (No. 416), which is of the same size, and in\r\ncharacter similar to _Les Amusements Champêtres_ (No. 391), is the last\r\nby Watteau of which we have any certain knowledge. It was painted in\r\n1720, the year before his death, when his health prevented him from\r\nmaking any sustained effort. It is said to have been a commission from\r\nhis friends M. and Mme. de Julienne, in whose shooting-box at Saint\r\nMaur, between the woods of Vincennes and the river, he went to repose\r\nfrom time to time.\r\n\r\nNICHOLAS LANCRET was only by six years Watteau's junior, so that he can\r\nhardly be considered as a pupil or even a disciple, but only as an\r\nimitator of Watteau. He was the pupil of Claude Gillot, and afterwards\r\nhis assistant, and it was not unnatural that a close friendship should\r\nhave been formed between Lancret and Watteau, or that it should have\r\nbeen dissolved by the deliberate imitation by the former of the latter's\r\nstyle--seeing how successful the imitation was. Two of the pictures by\r\nLancret at Hertford House, Nos. 422, _Conversation Galante_ and 440,\r\n_Fête in a Wood_, are fair examples of how close, at one period of his\r\ncareer, the imitation became. The latter is the _Bal dans un Bois_ which\r\nwas exhibited at the Place Dauphiné, and was complained of by Watteau on\r\naccount of its close resemblance to his own work.\r\n\r\nAnother in the Wallace Collection belongs to the same early period of\r\nWatteau's influence. The _Italian Comedians by a Fountain_ (No. 465),\r\nbeing attributed to Watteau in the sale, in 1853, at which it was bought\r\nfor Lord Hertford. His lordship was particularly anxious to secure this\r\npicture, \"Between _you_ and _I_,\" he writes, with the quaint\r\nregardlessness of grammar peculiar to the Victorian nobility, \"(and to\r\nno other person but you should I make this _confidence_), I must have\r\nthe Lancret called Watteau in the Standish Collection. So I depend upon\r\nyou for _getting it for me_. I need not beg you not to mention a word\r\nabout this to _anybody_, either _before_ or _after_ the sale.\" And\r\nagain, \"I _depend_ upon your getting the Lancret (Watteau in the\r\nCatalogue) for me. I have no doubt it will sell for a good sum, most\r\nlikely more than it is worth, but we _must_ have it ... I leave it to\r\nyou, but I must have it, unless by some unheard of chance it was to go\r\nbeyond 3000 guineas.\" He was fortunate indeed in getting it for £735.\r\n\r\n_Mademoiselle Camargo Dancing_ (No. 393), and _La Belle Grecque_ (No.\r\n450), in the Wallace Collection, are good examples of the Comedian\r\nmotive treated with more actuality, yet with no less grace. The four\r\nlittle allegorical pieces in the National Gallery, _The Four Ages of\r\nMan_, are more lively if less romantic, being composed more for the\r\ncharacters illustrating the subject than for poetical setting.\r\n\r\nJEAN BAPTISE JOSEPH PATER was actually a pupil of Watteau. He was ten\r\nyears his junior, but was equally unhappy on account of his health, and\r\ndied at forty. Like Lancret, he incurred Watteau's displeasure for a\r\nsimilar reason, though in his case it was rather the fear of what he\r\nwould do than what he did that was the cause of Watteau's displeasure.\r\nAt the same time, the names of both Lancret and Pater are inseparable\r\nfrom that of Watteau in the history of painting, and, both in their\r\nchoice of subject and their treatment of it, they are hardly\r\ndistinguishable to the casual observer. Watteau, it need hardly be said,\r\nwas far above the other two, but it was fortunate indeed that his\r\nromantic genius had two such gifted imitators as Lancret and Pater--or\r\nto put it the other way, that they had such a master to imitate, without\r\nwhom neither their work nor their influence would have been nearly as\r\ngreat as it was.\r\n\r\nFRANÇOIS BOUCHER, though doubtless influenced by Watteau, more\r\nespecially at the outset of his brilliant career, was nevertheless\r\nindependent of him in carrying forward the art painting in his country,\r\nchoosing rather to revert to the patronage of the Court like his\r\npredecessors Le Brun, Rigaud, and Largillière than to devote himself to\r\nthe expression of his own ideas and feelings. Being a pupil of François\r\nLe Moine, whose principal work was the decoration of Versailles, it is\r\nnot unnatural that Boucher should have succumbed to the influence of\r\nRoyalty, especially when exerted in his favour by as charming and as\r\npowerful an agent as Madame de Pompadour. Another early influence which\r\nshaped his artistic tendencies as well as his fortunes was that of Carle\r\nvan Loo, in whose honour his countrymen coined the verb _vanlotiser_--to\r\nfrivol agreeably--- on account of the popularity which he achieved as a\r\npainter of elegant trifles. There is a picture by Carle van Loo in the\r\nWallace Collection entitled _The Grand Turk giving a Concert to his\r\nMistress_ (No. 451), painted in 1737, which is a fair example of his\r\nproficiency in this direction, and there are one or two portraits\r\nscattered about the country which he painted when over here for a few\r\nmonths towards the end of his life. He died in Paris on the 15th July\r\n1765, and Boucher was immediately appointed his successor as principal\r\npainter to Louis XV.\r\n\r\nMadame de Pompadour was more than a patron to him, she was a matron! She\r\nmade an intimate friend and adviser of him, and it is to her that he\r\nowed most of his advancement at Court, which continued after her death.\r\nThe full-length portrait of her at Hertford House (No. 418) was\r\ncommissioned by her in 1759, and remained in her possession till her\r\ndeath in 1764. It was purchased by Lord Hertford in 1868 for 28,000\r\nfrancs. In the Jones Collection at the South Kensington Museum is\r\nanother portrait of her, and a third in the National Gallery at\r\nEdinburgh, not to mention those in private collections. The two\r\nmagnificent cartoons on the staircase at Hertford House, called the\r\n_Rising and Setting of the Sun_, she begged from the king. These were\r\nordered in 1748 as designs to be executed in tapestry at the Manufacture\r\nRoyale des Gobelins, by Cozette and Audran, according to the catalogue\r\nof the Salon in 1753 when they were exhibited. They are characterised by\r\nthe brothers de Goncourt as _le plus grand effort du peintre, les deux\r\ngrandes machines de son oeuvre_; and the writer of the catalogue of\r\nMadame de Pompadour's pictures when they were sold in 1766 testifies\r\nthus to the artist's own opinion of them: \"J'ai entendu plusieurs fois\r\ndire par l'auteur qu'ils étaient du nombre de ceux dont il était le plus\r\nsatisfait.\" They were then sold for 9800 livres, and Lord Hertford paid\r\n20,200 francs for them in 1855.\r\n\r\nEven without these _chefs d'oeuvre_ the Wallace Collection is richer\r\nthan any other gallery in the works of Boucher, with twenty-four\r\nexamples (in all), of which few if any are of inferior quality. But it\r\nmust be confessed that the abundance of Boucher's work does not enhance\r\nits artistic value, and we have to think of him, in comparison with\r\nWatteau and his school, rather as a great decorator than a great\r\npainter. With all his skill and charm, that is to say, there is not one\r\nof his canvases that we could place beside a picture by Watteau on\r\nanything like equal terms. Superficially it may be equally or possibly\r\nmore attractive, but inwardly there is no comparison. Let us hear what\r\nSir Joshua Reynolds has to say of him:--\r\n\r\n\"Our neighbours, the French, are much in this practice of extempore\r\ninvention, and their dexterity is such as even to excite admiration, if\r\nnot envy; but how rarely can this praise be given to their finished\r\npictures! The late Director of their Academy, Boucher, was eminent in\r\nthis way. When I visited him some years since in France, I found him at\r\nwork on a very large picture without drawings or models of any kind. On\r\nmy remarking this particular circumstance, he said, when he was young,\r\nstudying his art, he found it necessary to use models, but he had left\r\nthem off for many years.... However, in justice, I cannot quit this\r\npainter without adding that in the former part of his life, when he was\r\nin the habit of having recourse to nature, he was not without a\r\nconsiderable degree of merit--enough to make half the painters of his\r\ncountry his imitators: he had often grace and beauty, and good skill in\r\ncomposition, but I think all under the influence of a bad taste; his\r\nimitators are, indeed, abominable.\"\r\n\r\nTwenty-one years elapsed between the birth of Boucher and the next\r\npainter of anything like his ability, namely, JEAN BAPTISTE GREUZE. He\r\nwas a native of Tournous, near Macon, and lived to see the century out,\r\ndying in 1805, at the age of seventy-eight. His popularity is nowadays\r\ndue chiefly to his heads of young girls, which he painted in his later\r\nlife with admirable skill, but with a sentimentality that almost repels.\r\nThe famous example in the National Gallery is more free from the sickly\r\nsweetness that spoils most of them, and reminds us that he could paint\r\nmore serious works, and paint them exceedingly well. He first came into\r\nnotice by pictures like _La Lecture du Bible_, _La Malédiction\r\nPaternelle_, or _Le Fils Puni_, which are now to be seen--though\r\ngenerally passed by--at the Louvre, and his style was imitated in later\r\nyears in England by Wheatley and others of that school with more or less\r\nsuccess. It was a great blow to him, and one which seriously affected\r\nhis career when the Academy censured his Diploma picture, _The Emperor\r\nSeverus reproaching Caracalla_. But for this we might have had more than\r\nthese sentimental young ladies from a hand that was undoubtedly worthy\r\nof better things. However, as Lord Hertford admired them sufficiently to\r\ninclude no less than twenty-one of them in his collection, we ought not\r\nto be severe in criticising them, and we may quote the description of\r\n_The Souvenir_ (No. 398) given by John Smith, in his Catalogue Raisonné\r\nin 1837, as showing the esteem in which it was held.\r\n\r\n\"_The Souvenir._ An interesting female, about fifteen years of age,\r\npressing fondly to her bosom a little red and white spaniel dog; the pet\r\nanimal appears to remind her of some favourite object, for whose safety\r\nand return she is breathing an earnest wish; her fair oval countenance\r\nand melting eyes are directed upwards, and her ruby lips are slightly\r\nopen; her light hair falls negligently on her shoulder, and is\r\ntastefully braided\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PLATE XXXV.--JEAN-BAPTISTE GREUZE\r\n\r\nTHE BROKEN PITCHER\r\n\r\n_Louvre, Paris_]\r\n\r\nwith a crimson riband and pearls. She is attired in a morning dress,\r\nconsisting of a loose gown and a brownish scarf, the latter of which\r\nhangs across her arm. Upon a tree behind her is inscribed the name of\r\nthe painter. This beautiful production of art abounds in every\r\nattractive charm which gives interest to the master's works.\"\r\n\r\nVery different, and far superior to Greuze, was JEAN HONORÉ FRAGONARD,\r\nborn at Grasse, in the Alpes Maritimes, in 1732. In England his name was\r\nalmost unknown until within quite recent years, and the National Gallery\r\nhas only one picture by him, which was bequeathed by George Salting in\r\n1910. Fortunately he is well represented in the Wallace Collection,\r\nthree at least of the nine examples being in his most brilliant manner.\r\n\r\nFragonard's father was a glover. In 1750 the family moved to Paris, and\r\nthe boy was put into a notary's office. The usual signs of\r\ndisinclination for office work and a passion for art having duly\r\nappeared, he was sent to Boucher, who advised him to go and study under\r\nChardin. This he did for a short time, but finding it dull--for Chardin\r\nwas not as great a teacher as he was a painter--he went back to Boucher\r\nas an assistant. In 1752 he won the Prix de Rome, although he had never\r\nattended the Academy Schools, and in 1756 started for Italy.\r\n\r\nReynolds had just returned from Rome at the date of Fragonard's capture\r\nof the opportunity of going there, and we know from the _Discourses_ how\r\nhe spent his time there and what direction his studies took. Fragonard\r\npursued an exactly opposite course, being advised thereto by Boucher,\r\nwho said to him, \"If you take Michelangelo and Raphael seriously, you\r\nare lost.\" Feeling that the advice was suitable to himself, if not\r\nsound on general principles, Fragonard devoted himself to the lighter\r\nand more sparkling works of Tiepolo and others of the seventeenth and\r\neighteenth centuries. He also made a tour in South Italy and Sicily with\r\nHubert Robert, the landscape painter, and the Abbé Saint Non, the latter\r\nof whom published a number of etchings he made after Fragonard's\r\ndrawings, under the title of _Voyages de Naples et de Sicile_.\r\n\r\nOn returning to Paris in 1761 his first success was the large\r\ncomposition of _Callirhoé and Coresus_, which was exhibited at the Salon\r\nin 1765, and is now in the Louvre. But he soon abandoned the grand\r\nstyle, chiefly, it is probable, owing to the patronage of the idle or\r\nindustrious rich who showered commissions upon him, for smaller and more\r\nsociable pictures with which to adorn and enliven their houses. The\r\nbeautiful, but exceedingly improper picture at Hertford House, called\r\n_The Swing_--or in French, _Les Hazards heureux de l'Escarpolette_,\r\nappears to have been commissioned by the Baron de St. Julien, within the\r\nnext year or two, for in the memoirs of Cotté a conversation is recorded\r\nwhich shows that the Baron had asked another painter, Doyen, to paint\r\nit. \"Who would have believed,\" says the indignant Doyen, \"that within a\r\nfew days of my picture of Ste. Geneviéve being exhibited at the Salon, a\r\nnobleman would have sent for me to order a picture on a subject like\r\nthis.\" He then goes on to relate how the Baron explained to him exactly\r\nwhat he required. We cannot entirely acquit Fragonard of all blame in\r\naccepting such a commission, but he was a young man, just starting as a\r\nprofessional artist, with the example of Boucher before him, and it\r\nwould hardly have seemed wise to begin his career by offending a noble\r\npatron. The whole incident throws a glaring light on the conditions\r\nunder which the art of France flourished in the Louis Quinze period,\r\nwhen Boucher was everybody and Chardin nobody.\r\n\r\nFor the real Fragonard we may turn to _Le Chiffre d'Amour_, or the \"Lady\r\ncarving an initial,\" as the prosaic diction of the Wallace Collection\r\nhas it (No. 382). In this the equal delicacy of the sentiment and of the\r\npainting combine to effect a little masterpiece of Louis Quinze art. It\r\nis simple and natural, and entirely free from the besetting sins of so\r\nslight a picture triviality, affectation, empty prettiness, or simply\r\nsilliness. In its way it is perfect, and for that perfection is for ever\r\nreserved the popularity which we find temporarily accorded to pictures\r\nlike Frith's _Dolly Varden_ or Millais' _Bubbles_.\r\n\r\nAnother of the Hertford House examples, the portrait of a Boy as\r\nPierrot, is equally entitled to be popular for all time, and like\r\nReynolds's _Strawberry Girl_, might well be called \"one of the\r\nhalf-dozen original things\" which no artist ever exceeded in his life's\r\nwork. A comparison between the two pictures, which were probably painted\r\nwithin a few years of each other, will serve to show the difference\r\nbetween the English and French Schools at this period. On the one\r\nhand--to put it very shortly indeed--we see Fragonard influenced by\r\nTiepolo, France, and Louis XV.; on the other, Sir Joshua, influenced by\r\nMichelangelo and Raphael, England, and George III.\r\n\r\nThe mention of JEAN BAPTISTE SIMEON CHARDIN among this brilliant and\r\nfrivolous galaxy seems almost out of place. \"He is not so much an\r\neighteenth-century French artist,\" Lady Dilke says of him, \"as a French\r\nartist of pure race and type. Though he treated subjects of the\r\nhumblest and most unpretentious class, he brought to their rendering not\r\nonly deep feeling and a penetration which divined the innermost truths\r\nof the simplest forms of life, but a perfection of workmanship by which\r\neverything he handled was clothed with beauty.\" That the Wallace\r\nCollection includes no work from his hand is perhaps regrettable, but\r\ntruly Chardin was someone apart from all the magnificence that dazzles\r\nus there. His was the treasure of the humble.\r\n\r\nThe effects of the Revolution upon French painting were as surprising as\r\nthey were great. That the gay and frivolous art of Boucher and Fragonard\r\nshould have suddenly ceased might have been considered inevitable; but\r\nwhereas in Holland, when the Spanish yoke had been thrown off, and a\r\nRepublic proclaimed, a vigorous democratic school arose under Frans\r\nHals; and in England during the Commonwealth the artistic influence\r\nwhich was beginning to be spread by Charles I. and Buckingham utterly\r\nceased; in France an artistic Dictator arose, as we may well call him,\r\nin the person of JACQUES LOUIS DAVID, who not only made painting a part\r\nof the revolutionary propaganda, but succeeded under the Emperor\r\nNapoleon also in maintaining his position as painter to the Government,\r\nand thereby imposing on his country a style of art which had a great\r\ninfluence on the whole course of French painting for many years to come.\r\nBut the most remarkable thing was that it was to the classics that this\r\nrevolutioniser went for inspiration. The explanation is to be found in\r\nthe fact that he was bitterly aggrieved by the attitude of the Academy\r\nto him as a young man, and in the accident of his famous picture of\r\nBrutus synchronising with the events of 1789. He was at once hailed as a\r\ndeliverer, and made, as it were, painter to the Revolution.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PLATE XXXVI.--FRAGONARD\r\n\r\nL'ÉTUDE\r\n\r\n_Louvre, Paris_]\r\n\r\nBut what was even more important in the influence he exerted at this\r\ntime was his actual appointment as President of the Convention, which\r\ngave him the power to revenge himself upon the Academy, which he did by\r\nextinguishing it in 1793, and to remove any inconvenient rivals by\r\nindicting them as aristocrats. Of the older painters, Fragonard and\r\nGreuze were the only important ones left, and as they could not under\r\nthe altered circumstances be considered as rivals to the classical\r\nDavid, they both saw the century out. Fragonard simply ceased painting\r\nfor want of patrons, and David was good enough to procure him a post in\r\nthe Museum des Arts, or he would have starved. Unfortunately he\r\nattempted to adapt himself to the new style, and was promptly ejected\r\nfrom his post--ostensibly on his previous connection with royalty--and\r\nwas wise enough to fly to his native town in the south.\r\n\r\nDuring the first quarter of the nineteenth century the dictatorship of\r\nDavid was supreme. How it was finally overthrown we shall see in another\r\nchapter.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_THE ENGLISH SCHOOL_\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI\r\n\r\nTHE EARLY PORTRAIT PAINTERS\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the preface to the _Anecdotes of Painting_ written in 1762, Horace\r\nWalpole observes that this country had not a single volume to show on\r\nthe works of its painters. \"In truth,\" he continues, \"it has very rarely\r\ngiven birth to a genius in that profession. Flanders and Holland have\r\nsent us the greatest men that we can boast. This very circumstance may\r\nwith reason prejudice the reader against a work, the chief business of\r\nwhich must be to celebrate the art of a country which has produced so\r\nfew good artists. This objection is so striking, that instead of calling\r\nit _The Lives of English Painters_, I have simply given it the title of\r\n_Anecdotes of Painting in England_.\"\r\n\r\nAs Walpole's work was merely a compilation from the voluminous notes of\r\nGeorge Vertue, a painstaking antiquary who had collected every scrap of\r\ninformation he could acquire in the early years of the eighteenth\r\ncentury, his conclusions can hardly be questioned, and the foundation of\r\nthe English school of painting is therefore generally assumed to have\r\nbeen effected by Reynolds. But as Wren's Cathedral replaced an older one\r\nwhich was destroyed by the fire of London, and as that was reared on\r\nthe foundation of a Roman temple, so we find that the art of painting in\r\nEngland was certainly practised in earlier times, and but for certain\r\ncircumstances much more of it would have survived than is now to be\r\nfound.\r\n\r\nIn other countries, as we have seen, the Church was in earlier times the\r\ngreatest if not the only patron of the arts, and there is plenty of\r\nevidence to show that in England, too, from the reign of Henry III.\r\nonwards till the Reformation, our churches were decorated with frescoes.\r\nThis evidence is of two kinds; first, entries in royal and other\r\naccounts, directing payment for specified work; and secondly, the\r\nremains of fresco painting in our cathedrals and churches. The former is\r\nof little interest except to the antiquary. The latter has suffered so\r\nmuch from neglect or actual destruction as to be considered unworthy of\r\nthe attention of either the artist in search of inspiration or the\r\ncritic in pursuit of anything to criticise; but when every\r\ninconsiderable production in the little world of English art has had its\r\nbulky quarto written upon it, it is curious that no one has yet\r\ndiscovered what a splendid harvest awaits the investigation of these old\r\nfrescoes all over the country.\r\n\r\nAs it is, we have only to note that as religion was so important an\r\ninfluence on painting in other countries so was it in England, only\r\nunfortunately as a destroying and not a cherishing influence. Granting\r\nthe probability that there were few, if any, of our English frescoes\r\nwhich would be comparable in artistic interest with those in Italy,\r\nwhere the art was so sedulously cultivated, it must nevertheless be\r\nremembered that only a fragment remains here and there out of all the\r\nwork which must have been produced, and that after the Reformation even\r\nthose works which did survive were treated with positive as well as\r\nnegative obloquy, so that where they have been preserved at all it is\r\nonly by having been whitewashed over or otherwise hidden and damaged.\r\n\r\nEven worse than the Reformation in 1530, was the Puritan outburst a\r\ncentury later, which not only destroyed works of art, but extinguished\r\nall hope of their being created. Is it to be wondered at, then, that the\r\nfoundation of the English School of painting should have been postponed\r\nfor a century more?\r\n\r\nAt the same time it is interesting to note that the little painting\r\nwhich did creep into England in the sixteenth century, was of the very\r\nkind that formed the chief feature of the English School when it was\r\nfinally established, namely portraiture. Here again we see the influence\r\nof religion; for to the reformed church, at least as interpreted by the\r\nEnglish temperament, the second commandment was and is still second only\r\nin number, not in importance. To Protestant or Puritan the idea of a\r\npicture in a church was anathema. As late as 1766, when Benjamin West\r\noffered to decorate St. Paul's Cathedral with a painting of Moses\r\nreceiving the tables of the law on Mount Sinai, the Bishop exclaimed, \"I\r\nhave heard of the proposition, and as I am head of the Cathedral of the\r\nMetropolis, I will not suffer the doors to be opened to introduce\r\npopery.\"\r\n\r\nThe painting of a portrait, however, was a very different matter, and\r\nfrom the earliest times appears to have appealed with peculiar strength\r\nto the vanity of Britons. Loudly as they protested against the iniquity\r\nof bowing down to and worshipping the likeness of anything in heaven\r\nabove or in the earth beneath or in the waters under the earth, they\r\nwere never averse to giving others an opportunity of bowing down to and\r\nworshipping the likenesses of themselves; and while religion fostered\r\nthe arts in other countries, self-importance kept them alive in this.\r\nThe portrait of Richard II. in Westminster Abbey, if not actually an\r\ninstance of this, certainly happens to seem like one.\r\n\r\nWith the exception of Jan de Mabuse, who is said to have been in England\r\nfor a short time during the reign of Henry VII., the first painter of\r\nany importance in this country was Hans Holbein. Hearing that money was\r\nto be made by painting portraits at the English Court, he forsook his\r\nnative town, his religious art, and his wife, and came to stay with Sir\r\nThomas More at Chelsea, with an introduction from Erasmus. Arriving in\r\n1527, he started business by making a sketch in pen and ink of More's\r\nentire family, with which marvellous work, still preserved in the Museum\r\nat Basle, the history of modern English painting may fairly be said to\r\nhave begun; for though it was long before a native of England was\r\nforthcoming who was of sufficient force to carry on the tradition, the\r\nseed was sown, and in due course the plant appeared, and after many\r\nvicissitudes, at last flourished.\r\n\r\nThe immediate effect may be noted by mentioning here the names of\r\nGUILLIM STREETES, who was possibly English born, and JOHN BETTES who\r\ncertainly was. To the former is attributed the large whole-length\r\nportrait at Hampton Court of Thomas Howard, Earl of Surrey, in a suit of\r\nbright red. Another portrait of Howard belongs to the Duke of Norfolk,\r\nhaving been presented to his ancestor by Sir Robert Walpole. Both were\r\nexhibited at the Tudor Exhibition in 1892. Streetes was painter to King\r\nEdward VI., and according to Stype he was paid fifty marks, in 1551,\r\n\"for recompense of three great tables whereof two were the pictures of\r\nhis Highness sent to Sir Thomas Hoby and Sir John Mason (ambassadors\r\nabroad), the third a picture of the late Earl of Surrey attainted, and\r\nby the Councils' commandment fetched from the said Guillim's house.\"\r\nHorace Walpole was under the impression that this was the Duke of\r\nNorfolk's picture, but the Hampton Court Catalogue claims the other one\r\nas the work of Streetes.\r\n\r\nIn the National Gallery is a bust portrait of Edmund Butts, physician to\r\nHenry VIII., which is inscribed _faict par Johan Bettes Anglois_, and\r\nwith the date 1545. In this the influence of Holbein is certainly\r\ndiscernible, though not all pervading. There were two brothers, THOMAS\r\nand JOHN BETTES who are mentioned by Meres with several other English\r\npainters in _Palladis Tamia_, published in 1598--\"As Greece had moreover\r\ntheir painters, so in England we have also these, William and Francis\r\nSegar, brethren, Thomas and John Bettes, Lockie, Lyne, Peake, Peter\r\nCole, Arnolde, Marcus (Mark Garrard),\" etc. Walpole, quoting this, adds,\r\n\"I quote this passage to prove to those who learn one or two names by\r\nrote that every old picture you see is not by Holbein.\" At the same time\r\nit must be admitted that until some considerable fund of information\r\nconcerning these early days of painting is brought to light, there is\r\nvery little to be said about any one except Holbein till almost the end\r\nof the sixteenth century.\r\n\r\nThat Holbein was \"a wonderful artist,\" as More wrote to Erasmus, is not\r\nto be denied. But in placing him among the very greatest, we must not\r\nforget that his range was somewhat limited. We might nowadays call him a\r\nspecialist, for in England he painted nothing but portraits, and very\r\nfew of his pictures contained anything besides the single figure, or\r\nhead, of the subject. The famous exception is the large picture called\r\n_The Ambassadors_, which was purchased at an enormous price from the\r\nLongford Castle collection, and is now in the National Gallery.\r\nImportant and interesting as this is as showing us how Holbein could\r\nfill a large canvas, there is no doubt that he is far happier in simple\r\nportraiture, and that the £60,000 expended on _Christina Duchess of\r\nMilan_ was, relatively, a better investment for the nation. In the\r\nfamous half-lengths like the _George Gisze_ at Berlin (which was painted\r\nin London) and the _Man with the Hawk_, where the portrait is surrounded\r\nby accessories, Holbein is perhaps at his very best; but it is as a\r\npainter of heads, simply, that he influenced the English School, and set\r\nan example which, alas! has never been attainable since.\r\n\r\nFor one thing, which is apart altogether from talent or genius,\r\nHolbein's method was never followed in later times, namely, the practice\r\nof making carefully finished drawings in crayon before painting a\r\nportrait in oils. He was a wonderful draughtsman, and in the series of\r\nover eighty drawings at Windsor we have even more life-like images of\r\nthe persons represented than their finished portraits. I am not aware\r\nthat any portrait drawings exists of Holbein's contemporaries or\r\nsuccessors in England earlier than one or two by Van Dyck. There are a\r\ngood many belonging to the seventeenth century, but with one or two\r\nexceptions they are little more than sketches. And though sketches have\r\nonly survived by accident, as it were, not being intended for anything\r\nmore than the artist's own purposes, finished drawings would have been\r\nkept, like Holbein's, with much greater care.\r\n\r\nIn a word, then, Holbein's first and chief business was in rendering the\r\nlikeness of the sitter. Being a\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PLATE XXXVII.--HANS HOLBEIN\r\n\r\nANNE OF CLEVES\r\n\r\n_Louvre, Paris_]\r\n\r\nborn genius, he accomplished far more than this; but it is important in\r\ntracing the development of the English School of painting to remember\r\nthat its origin was not in the idealization of religious sentiment, but\r\nin the realization of the human features. From the time of the first\r\ngreat genius to that of the next, exactly a century later, there is\r\nhardly a portrait in existence that is valued for anything but its\r\nhistoric or personal interest. Between Holbein and Van Dyck is a great\r\ngap, in which the only names of Englishmen are those of the\r\nminiaturists, Hilliard and Oliver, who were veritably of the seed of\r\nHolbein, but only in little.\r\n\r\nVan Dyck struck deeper into the English soil, and loosened it\r\nsufficiently for the growth of larger stuff, if still somewhat coarse,\r\nlike the work of William Dobson and Robert Walker. To Van Dyck succeeded\r\nPeter Lely, who boldly and worthily assumed the mantle of Van Dyck, and\r\nkept English portraiture alive throughout the dismal period of the\r\nCommonwealth. After the Restoration he was still in power, and under him\r\nflourished one or two painters of English birth, like Greenhill and\r\nRiley, who in turn gave way to others under Kneller without ceding the\r\nmonopoly to foreigners. From these came Jervas, Richardson, and, most\r\nimportant, Hudson, who was Reynolds's master, and so we arrive at the\r\nbeginning of what is now generally known as the English School.\r\n\r\nAnother source, however, must here be mentioned as joining the main\r\nstream, and contributing a solid body of water to it, chiefly below the\r\nsurface, namely the art of WILLIAM HOGARTH. Being essentially English,\r\nand without any artistic forefathers, it is not surprising that he left\r\nless perceptible impressions on his immediate successors than the more\r\naccomplished and educated Reynolds; but the solid force of his\r\ncharacter, as exemplified in his career and his works, is hardly a less\r\nimportant factor in the development of the English School, while from\r\nhis outspoken opinions on the state of the arts in his time he is one of\r\nthe most valuable sources of its history.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nII\r\n\r\nWILLIAM HOGARTH\r\n\r\n\r\nWILLIAM HOGARTH occupies a curious position in the history of English\r\npainting. There was nothing ever quite like him in any country--except\r\nGreuze in France; for though a comparison between two such opposites,\r\nseems at first sight absurd, it must be remembered that French and\r\nEnglish painting in the middle of the eighteenth century were no less\r\nfar apart. Both Greuze and Hogarth, in their own fashion, tried to\r\npreach moral lessons in paint, the one in the over-refined atmosphere of\r\nFrench surroundings, the other in the coarse language of England in his\r\ntime.\r\n\r\nHogarth's chief characteristic was his blunt, honest, bull-dog\r\nEnglishness, which at the particular moment of his appearance on the\r\nartistic stage was a quality which was eminently serviceable to English\r\npainting. Though of humble parents, his honest and forceful character\r\nwon for him the daughter of Sir James Thornhill in marriage (by\r\nelopement) and his sturdy talent in painting secured for him his\r\nfather-in-law's forgiveness and encouragement. Thornhill came of a good,\r\nold Wiltshire family, and had been knighted by George I. for his\r\nsterling merits as much as for his skill in painting and decorating the\r\nroyal palaces and the houses of noblemen. His place among English\r\nartists is not a very high one, but he deserves the credit of having\r\nstood out against the monopoly that was being established by foreigners\r\nin this country in every department of artistic work, and in this sense\r\nhe is a still earlier forerunner of the great English painters, than his\r\nmore forcible son-in-law.\r\n\r\nIf Hogarth had been content to follow the beaten track of portraiture as\r\nhis main pursuit, and let the country's morals take care of themselves,\r\nhe would in all probability have attained much greater heights as a\r\npainter. But his nature would not allow him to do this. His character\r\nwas too strong and his originality too uncontrollable. There is enough\r\nevidence among the works which have survived him, especially in those\r\nwhich were never finished, to show that his accomplishments in oil\r\npainting were of a very high order indeed. I need only refer to the\r\nfamous head in the National Gallery known as _The Shrimp Girl_ to\r\nexplain what I mean. In this surprisingly vivacious and charming sketch\r\nwe see something that is not inferior to Hals, in its broad truth and\r\nits quick seizure of the essentials of what had to be rendered. In\r\nanother unfinished piece, which is now in the South London Art Gallery\r\nat Camberwell, we see the same powerful qualities differently exhibited,\r\nfor it is not a single head this time, but a sketch of a ballroom where\r\neverybody is dancing, except one gentleman who is even more vivid than\r\nthe rest, in the act of mopping his head at the open window. There is\r\nnothing grotesque in this picture, but it is all perfectly life-like and\r\nwonderfully sketched in.\r\n\r\nIn his finished pictures Hogarth does not appear to such great\r\nadvantage--I mean as a painter; but it must be remembered that in his\r\nday there was little example for him to follow in the higher departments\r\nof his art. Nor had he ever been out of England to see fine pictures on\r\nthe Continent. Not only this, but as his work was intended especially to\r\nappeal to ordinary people, it is hardly to be expected that he would\r\nexpress himself in terms other than might most quickly appeal to them.\r\nHis most famous works, indeed, were executed as well as designed for the\r\nengraver, namely _The Harlot's Progress_, _The Rake's Progress_,\r\n_Marriage à la Mode_, and _The Election_, each of which consisted of a\r\nseries of several minutely finished pictures. In portraiture he showed\r\nfiner qualities, it is true; but even in these he was thinking more of\r\ngetting the most out of his model, according to his forcible character,\r\nthan of any technical refinements for which he might be handed down to\r\nposterity as a great painter.\r\n\r\nIt was easy enough for Reynolds to sneer at Hogarth for his vulgarity,\r\nwhen he was trying to impress upon his pupils the importance of painting\r\nin the grand style. \"As for the various departments of painting,\" he\r\nsays in his third Discourse, \"which do not presume to make such high\r\npretensions, they are many. None of them are without their merit, though\r\nnone enter into competition with this universal presiding idea of the\r\nart. The painters who have applied themselves more particularly to low\r\nand vulgar characters, and who express with precision the various shades\r\nof passion as they are exhibited by vulgar minds (such as we see in the\r\nworks of Hogarth), deserve great praise; but as their genius has been\r\nemployed on low and confined subjects, the praise which we must give\r\nmust be as limited as its object.\" And yet it was in following an\r\nexample set by Hogarth in portrait painting that Reynolds gained his\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PLATE XXXVIII.--WILLIAM HOGARTH\r\n\r\nTHE SHRIMP GIRL\r\n\r\n_National Gallery, London_]\r\n\r\nfirst success in that art. I mean the full-length portrait of Captain\r\nKeppel, painted in 1752. This originality and boldness in disregarding\r\nthe tame but universal convention in posing the sitter was peculiarly\r\nHogarth's own. With him it amounted almost to perverseness. He would not\r\nlet anybody \"sit\" to him, if he could help it. When he did, as in the\r\nportraits of Quinn, the actor, and Hoadly, Bishop of Winchester, in the\r\nNational Gallery, the result is not the happiest; for, with all their\r\nforce, these portraits lack the grace that a conventional pose requires\r\nto render it acceptable in the terms of its convention. If a man must\r\nput on the accepted evening dress of his time, he must see that it\r\nconforms in the spirit as well as in the letter of the fashion, or he\r\nwill only look like a dressed-up greengrocer. Hogarth was too sturdy and\r\ntoo wilful to put on court clothes. If he had to, he struggled with\r\nthem.\r\n\r\nHogarth's father was a man of literary tastes, and a scholar. He had\r\nwritten a supplement to Littleton's Latin Dictionary, but was unable to\r\nget it published. \"I saw the difficulties,\" writes the artist, \"under\r\nwhich my father laboured; the many inconveniences he endured from his\r\ndependence, living chiefly on his pen, and the cruel treatment he met\r\nwith from booksellers and printers. I had before my eyes the precarious\r\nsituation of men of classical education; it was therefore conformable to\r\nmy wishes that I was taken from school and served a long apprenticeship\r\nto a silver-plate engraver.\" This is printed in Allan Cunningham's _Life\r\nof Hogarth_, together with many more extracts from autobiographical\r\nmemoranda, from which we may learn at first hand a great deal of\r\ninformation bearing on the state of painting at this period, and the\r\ncircumstances under which it received such a stimulus from Hogarth,\r\nbefore the sun had fully risen (in the person of Reynolds) to illumine\r\nthe whole period of British art.\r\n\r\n\"As I had naturally a good eye and fondness for drawing,\" Hogarth\r\ncontinues, \"_shows_ of all sorts gave me uncommon pleasure when young,\r\nand mimicry, common to all children, was remarkable in me. An early\r\naccess to a neighbouring painter drew my attention from play, and I was\r\nat every possible opportunity engaged in making drawings.... My\r\nexercises at school were more remarkable for the ornaments which adorned\r\nthem than for the exercise itself. In the former I soon found that\r\nblockheads with better memories would soon surpass me, but for the\r\nlatter I was particularly distinguished.\r\n\r\n\"The painting of St. Paul's and Greenwich Hospital, which were at that\r\ntime going on, ran in my head, and I determined that silver-plate\r\nengraving should be followed no longer than necessity obliged me to it.\r\nEngraving on copper was, at twenty years of age, my utmost ambition. To\r\nattain that it was necessary that I should learn to draw objects\r\nsomething like nature, instead of the monsters of heraldry, and the\r\ncommon methods of study were much too tedious for one who loved his\r\npleasure and came so late to it.... This led me to consider whether a\r\nshorter road than that usually travelled was not to be found.... I had\r\nlearned by practice to copy with tolerable correctness in the ordinary\r\nway, but it occurred to me that there were many disadvantages attending\r\nthis method of study, as having faulty originals, etc.; and even when\r\nthe prints or pictures to be imitated were by the best masters, it was\r\nlittle more than pouring water out of one vessel into another. Many\r\nreasons led me to wish that I could find a shorter path--fix forms and\r\ncharacters in my mind--and, instead of copying the lines, try to read\r\nthe language, and if possible find the grammar of the art, by bringing\r\ninto one focus the various observations I had made, and then trying by\r\nmy power on the canvas how far my plan enabled me to combine and apply\r\nthem to practice....\r\n\r\n\"I had one material advantage over my competitors, viz., the early habit\r\nI acquired of retaining in my mind's eye, without coldly copying on the\r\nspot, whatever I intended to imitate.... Instead of burdening the memory\r\nwith musty rules, or tiring the eye with copying dry or damaged\r\npictures, I have ever found studying from nature the shortest and safest\r\nway of obtaining knowledge in my art....\"\r\n\r\n\"I entertained some thoughts,\" he writes again, \"of succeeding in what\r\nthe puffers in books call the great style of history painting, so that,\r\nwithout having had a stroke of this grand business before, I quitted\r\nsmall portraits and familiar conversations, and with a smile at my own\r\ntemerity commenced history painter, and on a great staircase at St.\r\nBartholomew's Hospital painted two Scripture stories, _The Pool of\r\nBethesda_ and _The Good Samaritan_, with figures seven feet high. These\r\nI presented to the charity, and thought that they might serve as a\r\nspecimen to show that, were there an inclination in England for\r\nencouraging historical pictures, such a first essay might prove the\r\npainting them more easily attainable than is generally imagined. But as\r\nReligion, the great promoter of this style in other countries, rejected\r\nit in England, and I was unwilling to sink into a\r\nportrait-manufacturer--and still ambitious of being singular, I soon\r\ndropped all expectations of advantage from that source, and returned to\r\nthe pursuit of my former dealings with the public at large.\"\r\n\r\nFew seemed disposed to recognise, in any of Hogarth's works, a higher\r\naim than that of raising a laugh. Somerville, the poet, dedicated his\r\n_Rural Games_ to Hogarth in these words--\"Permit me, Sir, to make choice\r\nof you for my patron, being the greatest master in the burlesque way.\r\nYour province is the town--leave me a small outride in the country, and\r\nI shall be content.\" Fielding had a different opinion of his merits: \"He\r\nwho would call the ingenious Hogarth a burlesque painter would in my\r\nopinion do him very little honour, for sure it is much easier, much less\r\nthe subject of admiration, to paint a man with a nose, or any other\r\nfeature of a preposterous size, or to expose him in some absurd or\r\nmonstrous attitude, than to express the affections of man on canvas. It\r\nhath been thought a vast commendation of a painter to say his figures\r\nseem to breathe, but surely it is a much greater and nobler applause\r\nthat they appear to think.\"\r\n\r\nIn answer to criticism of his _Analysis of Beauty_, Hogarth writes:\r\n\"Among other crimes of which I am accused, it is asserted that I have\r\nabused the 'Great Masters'; this is far from being just. So far from\r\nattempting to lower the ancients, I have always thought, and it is\r\nuniversally admitted, that they knew some fundamental principles in\r\nnature which enabled them to produce works that have been the admiration\r\nof succeeding ages; but I have not allowed this merit to those\r\nleaden-headed imitators, who, having no consciousness of either symmetry\r\nor propriety, have attempted to mend nature, and in their truly ideal\r\nfigures, gave similar proportions to a Mercury and a Hercules.\"\r\n\r\nAnother and a better spirit influenced him in the following passage--he\r\nis proposing to seek the principles of beauty in nature instead of\r\nlooking for them in mere learning. His words are plain, direct, and\r\nconvincing. \"Nature is simple, plain, and true in all her works, and\r\nthose who strictly adhere to her laws, and closely attend to her\r\nappearances in their infinite varieties are guarded against any\r\nprejudicial bias from truth; while those who have seen many things that\r\nthey cannot well understand, and read many books which they do not fully\r\ncomprehend, notwithstanding all their parade of knowledge, are apt to\r\nwander about it and about it; perplexing themselves and their readers\r\nwith the various opinions of other men. As to those painters who have\r\nwritten treatises on painting, they were in general too much taken up\r\nwith giving rules for the operative part of the art, to enter into\r\nphysical disquisitions on the nature of the objects.\"\r\n\r\nAfter this it would be unfair to withhold the praise of Benjamin West\r\n(who succeeded Reynolds as President of the Royal Academy)--a painter,\r\nprudent in speech, and frugal in commendation. \"I remember, when I was a\r\nlad,\" says Smith, in his account of Nollekens, \"asking the late\r\nvenerable President West what he thought of Hogarth's _Analysis of\r\nBeauty_, and his answer was, 'It is a work of the highest value to\r\neveryone studying the art. Hogarth was a strutting consequential little\r\nman, and made himself many enemies by that book; but now that most of\r\nthem are dead, it is examined by disinterested readers, unbiassed by\r\npersonal animosities, and will be more and more read, studied and\r\nunderstood.'\"\r\n\r\nIn his memoranda respecting the establishment of an Academy of Art in\r\nEngland, Hogarth writes well and wisely. Voltaire asserts that after\r\nthe establishment of the French Academy not one work of genius appeared,\r\nfor all the painters became mannerists and imitators. Hogarth agrees\r\nwith him, declaring that \"the institution will serve to raise and\r\npension a few bustling and busy men, whose whole employment will be to\r\ntell a few simple students when a leg is too long, or an arm too short.\r\nMore will flock to the study of art than genius sends; the hope of\r\nprofit, or the thirst of distinction, will induce parents to push their\r\noffspring into the lecture-room, and many will appear and but few be\r\nworthy. The paintings of Italy form a sort of ornamental fringe to their\r\ngaudy religion, and Rome is the general storeshop of Europe. The arts\r\nowe much to Popery, and Popery owes much of its universality to the\r\narts. The French have attained to a sort of foppish magnificence in art;\r\nin Holland, selfishness is the ruling passion, and in England vanity is\r\nunited with selfishness. Portrait-painting, therefore, has succeeded,\r\nand ever will succeed better in England than in any other country, and\r\nthe demand will continue as new faces come into the market.\r\n\r\n\"Portrait painting is one of the ministers of vanity, and vanity is a\r\nmunificent patroness; historical painting seeks to revive the memory of\r\nthe dead, and the dead are very indifferent paymasters. Paintings are\r\nplentiful enough in England to keep us from the study of nature; but\r\nstudents who confine their studies to the works of the dead, need never\r\nhope to live themselves; they will learn little more than the names of\r\nthe painters: true painting can only be learnt in one school, and that\r\nis kept by Nature.\"\r\n\r\nHogarth disliked a formal school, says Cunningham, because he was the\r\npupil of nature, and foresaw that students would flock to it from the\r\nfeeling of trade rather than the impulse of genius, and that it become a\r\nmanufactory for conventional forms and hereditary graces. Opulent\r\ncollectors were filling their galleries with the religious paintings of\r\nthe Romish Church, and vindicating their purchases by representing these\r\nworks as the only patterns of all that is noble in art and worthy of\r\nimitation. Hogarth perceived that all this was not according to the\r\nnatural spirit of the nation; he well knew that our island had not yet\r\npoured out its own original mind in art, as it had done in poetry; and\r\nhe felt assured that such a time would come, if native genius were not\r\noverlaid systematically by mock patrons and false instructors.\r\n\r\n\"As a painter,\" says Walpole, \"Hogarth has slender merit.\" \"What is the\r\nmerit of a painter?\" Cunningham concludes. \"If it be to represent\r\nlife--to give us an image of man--to exhibit the workings of his\r\nheart--to record the good and evil of his nature--to set in motion\r\nbefore us the very beings with whom earth is peopled--to shake us with\r\nmirth--to sadden us with woeful reflection--to please us with natural\r\ngrouping, vivid action, and vigorous colouring--Hogarth has done all\r\nthis--and if he that has done so be not a painter, who will show us\r\none?\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIII\r\n\r\nSIR JOSHUA REYNOLDS AND THOMAS GAINSBOROUGH\r\n\r\n\r\nWhether or not SIR JOSHUA REYNOLDS is entitled to be ranked among the\r\nvery greatest painters, there can be no question that he has a place\r\namong the most famous, not only on account of his actual painting, but\r\nalso because of the influence exerted by his whole-hearted devotion to\r\nhis art, and his strong character in forming, out of such unpromising\r\nelements, a really vigorous school of painting in this country. The\r\nexample he set in the strenuous exercise of his profession, the precepts\r\nhe laid down for the guidance of students, and the dignity with which he\r\ninvested the whole practice of painting which, until he came, had\r\ndegenerated into a mere business, were of incalculable benefit to his\r\nown and succeeding ages, and Edmund Burke was paying him no empty\r\ncompliment but only stating the bare truth when he said that Sir Joshua\r\nReynolds was the first Englishman who added the praise of the elegant\r\narts to the other glories of his country.\r\n\r\nJoshua Reynolds was born at Plympton in Devonshire on the 16th July\r\n1723; the son of the Rev. Samuel Reynolds and his wife Theophila Potter.\r\nHe was on every side connected with the Church, for both his father and\r\nhis grandfather were in holy orders, his mother was the daughter of a\r\nclergyman, and his maternal grandmother also. His father's elder\r\nbrother, too, was a clergyman, a fellow of Eton College and Canon of St.\r\nPeter's, Exeter. So that here, as in Italy, we start with a basis of\r\nreligion.\r\n\r\nThe young artist's first essays were made in copying several little\r\nthings done by his elder sisters, and he afterwards took great delight\r\nin copying such prints as he met with in his father's books,\r\nparticularly those in Plutarch's _Lives_, and in Jacob Cats's _Book of\r\nEmblems_, which his great-grandmother by his father's side, a Dutch\r\nwoman, had brought from Holland. When he was only eight years old he\r\nread with great avidity a book called _The Jesuits Perspective_, an\r\narchitectural, not a religious work, and made himself so completely\r\nmaster of it that he never afterwards had occasion to study any other\r\ntreatise on the subject. In fact, a drawing which he then made of\r\nPlympton School so filled his father with wonder that he said to him,\r\n\"Now this exemplifies what the author of the _Perspective_ says in his\r\npreface--that by observing the rules laid down in his book a man may do\r\nwonders, for this is wonderful!\"\r\n\r\nFrom these attempts he proceeded to draw likenesses of his friends and\r\nrelations with tolerable success. But what most strongly confirmed him\r\nin his love of the art was Richardson's _Treatise on Painting_, the\r\nperusal of which so delighted and inflamed his mind, that Raphael\r\nappeared to him superior to the most illustrious names of ancient or\r\nmodern times--a notion which he loved to indulge all the rest of his\r\nlife.\r\n\r\nBefore he was eighteen years old his father placed him as a pupil with\r\nThomas Hudson, who was then the most distinguished portrait-painter in\r\nEngland; but having some disagreement with his master, the young man\r\nreturned to Devonshire, where he practised portrait painting with more\r\nor less success until in 1749 he accompanied Admiral Keppel to the\r\nMediterranean, and remained for two or three years studying the old\r\nmasters in Italy.\r\n\r\nAs this period of Reynold's career had so determining an influence not\r\nonly on himself but on the whole course of the history of painting in\r\nEngland--inasmuch as it formed the greater part of the groundwork of his\r\ndiscourses when President of the Royal Academy, it is worth having an\r\naccount of it at first hand from the painter himself. \"It has frequently\r\nhappened,\" he says, \"as I was informed by the Keeper of the Vatican,\r\nthat many of those whom he had conducted through the various apartments\r\nof that edifice when about to be dismissed, have asked for the works of\r\nRaphael, and would not believe that they had already passed through the\r\nroom where they are preserved, so little impression had those\r\nperformances made on them. One of the first painters now in France once\r\ntold me that this circumstance happened to himself, though he now looks\r\non Raphael with that veneration which he deserves from all painters and\r\nlovers of the art. I remember very well my own disappointment when I\r\nfirst visited the the Vatican: but on confessing my feelings to a\r\nbrother student, of whose ingenuousness I had a high opinion, he\r\nacknowledged that the works of Raphael had the same effect on him, or\r\nrather that they did not produce the effect which he expected. This was\r\na great relief to my mind, and on inquiry further of other students I\r\nfound that those persons only who from natural imbecility appeared to be\r\nincapable of ever relishing those divine performances, made pretensions\r\nto instantaneous raptures on first beholding them.\r\n\r\n\"In justice to myself, however, I must add that though disappointed and\r\nmortified at not finding myself enraptured with the works of this great\r\nmaster, I did not for a moment conceive or suppose that the name of\r\nRaphael, and those admirable paintings in particular, owed their\r\nreputation to the ignorance and prejudice of mankind; on the contrary,\r\nmy not relishing them as I was conscious I ought to have done was one of\r\nthe most humiliating circumstances that ever happened to me. I found\r\nmyself in the midst of works executed upon principles with which I was\r\nunacquainted: I felt my ignorance, and stood abashed. All the indigested\r\nnotions of painting which I had brought with me from England where the\r\nart was in the lowest state it had ever been in (it could not indeed be\r\nlower) were to be totally done away and eradicated from my mind. It was\r\nnecessary, as it is expressed on a very solemn occasion, that I should\r\nbecome _as a little child_.\r\n\r\n\"Notwithstanding my disappointment, I proceeded to copy some of those\r\nexcellent works. I viewed them again and again; I even affected to feel\r\ntheir merit and to admire them more than I really did. In a short time a\r\nnew taste and new perceptions began to dawn upon me, and I was convinced\r\nthat I had originally formed a false opinion of the perfection of art,\r\nand that this great painter was well entitled to the high rank which he\r\nholds in the estimation of the world.\"\r\n\r\n\"When I was at Venice,\" he writes in a note on Du Fresnoy's _Art of\r\nPainting_ about the chiaroscuro of Titian, Paul Veronese and Tintoretto,\r\n\"the method I took to avail myself of their principles was this. When I\r\nobserved an extraordinary effect of light and shade in any picture, I\r\ntook a leaf of my pocket-book and darkened every part of it in the same\r\ngradation of light and shade as the picture, leaving the white paper\r\nuntouched to represent the light, and this without any attention to the\r\nsubject or to the drawing of the figures. After a few experiments I\r\nfound the paper blotted nearly alike; their general practice appeared to\r\nbe to allow not above a quarter of the picture for the light, including\r\nin this portion both the principal and secondary lights; another quarter\r\nto be as dark as possible, and the remaining half kept in mezzotint or\r\nhalf shadow.\r\n\r\n\"Rubens appears to have admitted rather more light than a quarter, and\r\nRembrandt much less, scarce an eighth; by this conduct Rembrandt's light\r\nis extremely brilliant, but it costs too much, the rest of the picture\r\nis sacrificed to this one object.\"\r\n\r\nThe results of these studies in Rome and Venice were at once observable\r\non his return to England in the beautiful portrait of _Giuseppe Marchi_,\r\none of the treasures belonging to the Royal Academy. It was altogether\r\ntoo much for the ignorant British artists, and it excited lively\r\ncomment. What chiefly attracted the public notice, however, was the\r\nwhole-length portrait which he painted of his friend and patron Admiral\r\nKeppel. On the appearance of this Reynolds was not only universally\r\nacknowledged to be at the head of his profession, but to be the greatest\r\npainter that England had seen since Van Dyck. The whole interval, as\r\nMalone observes, between the time of Charles I. and the conclusion of\r\nthe reign of George II. seemed to be annihilated, and the only question\r\nwas whether the new painter or Van Dyck were the more excellent.\r\nReynolds very soon saw how much animation might be obtained by deviating\r\nfrom the insipid manner of his immediate predecessors, and instead of\r\nconfining himself to mere likeness he dived, as it were, into the minds\r\nand habits and manners of those who sat to him, and accordingly the\r\nmajority of his portraits are so appropriate and characteristic that the\r\nmany illustrious persons whom he has delineated are almost as well known\r\nto us as if we had seen and conversed with them.\r\n\r\nVery soon after his return from Italy his acquaintance with Dr Johnson\r\ncommenced, and their intimacy continued uninterrupted to the time of\r\nJohnson's death. How much he profited thereby, especially in the\r\npractice of art, he has recorded in a paper which was intended to form a\r\npart of one of his discourses. \"I remember,\" he writes, \"Mr Burke\r\nspeaking of the _Essays_ of Sir Francis Bacon, said he thought them the\r\nbest of his works. Dr Johnson was of opinion 'that their excellence and\r\ntheir value consisted in being the observations of a strong mind\r\noperating upon life; and in consequence you find there what you seldom\r\nfind in other books,' It is this kind of excellence which gives a value\r\nto the performances of artists also.... The observations which he made\r\non poetry, on life, and on everything about us, I applied to our art;\r\nwith what success others must judge. Perhaps an artist in his studies\r\nshould pursue the same conduct, and instead of patching up a particular\r\nwork on the narrow plan of imitation, rather endeavour to acquire the\r\nart and power of thinking.\"\r\n\r\nIn another passage from his memoranda, quoted by Malone, Sir Joshua lets\r\nus into some more of the secrets of his pre-eminence in his art, both of\r\npainter and preceptor: for we are to remember that the British School of\r\npainting owes more to the influence of Reynolds than perhaps any other\r\nschool to the example of one man:--\r\n\r\n\"I considered myself as playing a great game,\" he writes, \"and instead\r\nof beginning to save money, I laid it out faster than I got it in,\r\npurchasing the best examples of art that could be procured; for I even\r\nborrowed money for this purpose. The possessing portraits by Titian, Van\r\nDyck, Rembrandt, etc., I considered as the best kind of wealth. By\r\nstudying carefully the works of great masters, this advantage is\r\nobtained--we find that certain niceties of expression are capable of\r\nbeing executed, which otherwise we might suppose beyond the reach of\r\nart. This gives us a confidence in ourselves, and we are thus incited to\r\nendeavour at not only the same happiness of execution but also at other\r\ncongenial excellencies. Study indeed consists in learning to see nature,\r\nand may be called the art of using other men's minds. By this kind of\r\ncontemplation and exercise we are taught to think in their way, and\r\nsometimes to attain their excellence. Thus, for instance, if I had never\r\nseen any of the works of Correggio, I should never perhaps have remarked\r\nin nature the expression which I find in one of his pieces; or if I had\r\nremarked it I might have thought it too difficult, or perhaps impossible\r\nto be executed.\r\n\r\n\"My success and continual improvement in my art (if I may be allowed\r\nthat expression), may be ascribed in a good measure to a principle which\r\nI will boldly recommend to imitation; I mean the principle of honesty;\r\nwhich in this as in all other instances is according to the vulgar\r\nproverb certainly the best policy: I always endeavoured to do my best.\r\n\r\n\"My principal labour was employed on the whole together, and I was never\r\nweary of changing and trying different modes and different effects. I\r\nhad always some scheme in my mind, and a perpetual desire to advance. By\r\nconstantly endeavouring to do my best, I acquired a power of doing that\r\nwith spontaneous facility that which at first was the effort of my whole\r\nmind.\"\r\n\r\n\"I had not an opportunity of being early initiated in the principles of\r\ncolouring\"; he continues, \"no man indeed could teach me. If I have never\r\nbeen settled with respect to colouring, let it at the same time be\r\nremembered that my unsteadiness in this respect proceeded from an\r\ninordinate desire to possess every kind of excellence that I ever saw in\r\nthe works of others, without considering that there are in colouring, as\r\nin style, excellencies which are incompatible with each other.... I\r\ntried every effect of colour, and by leaving out every colour in its\r\nturn, showed every colour that I could do without it. As I alternately\r\nleft out every\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PLATE XXXIX.--SIR JOSHUA REYNOLDS\r\n\r\nLADY COCKBURN AND HER CHILDREN\r\n\r\n_National Gallery, London_]\r\n\r\ncolour, I tried every new colour; and often, as is well known,\r\nfailed.... My fickleness in the mode of colouring arose from an eager\r\ndesire to attain the highest excellence.\"\r\n\r\nIn the year 1759 Reynolds began to write, and three of his essays were\r\nprinted in the _Idler_, which was conducted by Dr. Johnson. Northcote\r\nrecords that at the same time he committed to paper a variety of remarks\r\nwhich afterwards served him as hints for his discourses. One or two of\r\nthese will give us as good an idea as we are likely to get from\r\nelsewhere of what are the first requisites of a successful painter.\r\n\r\n\"It is absolutely necessary that a painter, as the first requisite,\r\nshould endeavour as much as possible to form to himself an idea of\r\nperfection not only of beauty, but of what is perfection in a picture.\r\nThis conception he should always have fixed in his view, and unless he\r\nhas this view we shall never see any approaches towards perfection in\r\nhis works; for it will not come by chance.\r\n\r\n\"If a man has nothing of that which is called genius, that is, if he is\r\nnot carried away, if I may so say, by the animation, the fire of\r\nenthusiasm, all the rules in the world will never make him a painter.\r\n\r\n\"He who possesses genius is enabled to see a real value in those things\r\nwhich others disregard and overlook. He perceives a difference in cases\r\nwhere inferior capacities see none; as the fine ear for music can\r\ndistinguish an evident variation in sounds which to another ear more\r\ndull seem to be the same. This example will also apply to the eye in\r\nrespect to colouring.\"\r\n\r\nIn the beginning of the year 1760, Reynolds moved into the house on the\r\nwest side of Leicester Square which he occupied for the rest of his\r\nlife. It is now tenanted by Messrs. Puttick & Simpson, the Auctioneers.\r\nNorthcote has usefully recorded the following details his studio. His\r\npainting-room was of an octagonal form, about twenty feet long and about\r\nsixteen in breath. The window which gave the light to this room was\r\nsquare, and not much larger than one half the size of a common window in\r\na private house, whilst the lower part of this window was nine feet four\r\ninches from the floor. The chair for his sitters was raised eighteen\r\ninches from the floor, and turned round on castors. His palettes were\r\nthose which are held by a handle, not those held on the thumb. The\r\nsticks of his pencils (brushes) were long, measuring about nineteen\r\ninches. He painted in that part of the room nearest the window, and\r\nnever sat down when he worked. As the actual methods of a great artist\r\nare possibly of more value in a history of painting than the subjects,\r\nor even the prices, of his pictures, I venture to quote the following\r\nextracts from various parts of Sir Joshua's own memoranda:--\r\n\r\nNever give the least touch with your pencil (_i.e._ brush) till you have\r\npresent in your mind a perfect idea of your future work.\r\n\r\nPaint at the greatest possible distance from your sitter, and place the\r\npicture ... near to the sitter, or sometimes under him, so as to see\r\nboth together.\r\n\r\nIn beautiful faces keep the whole circumference about the eye in a\r\nmezzotinto, as seen in the works of Guido and the best of Carlo Maratti.\r\n\r\nEndeavour to look at the subject or sitter from which you are painting,\r\nas if it was a picture. This will in some degree render it more easy to\r\nbe copied.\r\n\r\nIn painting consider the object before you, whatever it may be, as more\r\nmade out by light and shadow than by lines.\r\n\r\nA student should begin his career by a careful finishing and making out\r\nthe parts; as practice will give him freedom and facility of hand: a\r\nbold and unfinished manner is commonly the habit of old age.\r\n\r\nOn painting a head--\r\n\r\nLet those parts which turn or retire from the eye be of broken or mixed\r\ncolours, as being less distinguished and nearer the borders.\r\n\r\nLet all your shadows be of one colour: glaze them till they are so.\r\n\r\nUse red colours in the shadows of the most delicate complexions, but\r\nwith discretion.\r\n\r\nContrive to have a screen with red or yellow colour on it, to reflect\r\nthe light on the shaded part of the sitter's face.\r\n\r\nAvoid the chalk, the brick dust, and the charcoal, and think on a pearl\r\nand a ripe peach.\r\n\r\nAvoid long continued lines in the eyes, and too many sharp ones.\r\n\r\nTake care to give your figure a sweep or sway.\r\n\r\nOutlines in waves, soft, and almost imperceptible against the\r\nbackground.\r\n\r\nNever make the contour too coarse.\r\n\r\nAvoid also those outlines and lines which are equal, which make\r\nparallels, triangles, etc.\r\n\r\nThe parts which are nearest to the eye appear most enlightened, deeper\r\nshadowed, and better seen.\r\n\r\nKeep broad lights and shadows, and also principal lights and shadows.\r\n\r\nWhere there is the deepest shadow it is accompanied by the brightest\r\nlight.\r\n\r\nLet nothing start out or be too strong for its place.\r\n\r\nSquareness has grandeur; it gives firmness to the forms; a serpentine\r\nline in comparison appears feeble and tottering.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nOne is apt to forget in these enlightened days how greatly the art of\r\npainting benefited by the establishment of public exhibitions.\r\nFarington's observations on this point, occasioned by the inauguration\r\nof the exhibitions at the Society of Arts from 1760, until the\r\nfoundation of the Royal Academy in 1768, are both instructive and\r\namusing.\r\n\r\n\"The history of our exhibitions,\" he says \"affords the strongest\r\nevidence of their impressive effect upon public taste. At their\r\ncommencement, though men of enlightened minds could distinguish and\r\nappreciate what was excellent, the admiration of the _many_ was confined\r\nto subjects either gross or puerile, and commonly to the meanest efforts\r\nof intellect; whereas at this time (1819) the whole train of subjects\r\nmost popular in the earlier exhibitions have disappeared. The loaf and\r\ncheese that could provoke hunger, the cat and canary bird, and the dead\r\nmackerel on a deal board, have long ceased to produce astonishment and\r\ndelight; while truth of imitation now finds innumerable admirers though\r\ncombined with the highest qualities of beauty, grandeur and taste.\r\n\r\n\"To our public exhibitions, and to arrangements that followed in\r\nconsequence of their introduction this change must be chiefly\r\nattributed. The present generation appears to be composed of a new and,\r\nat least with respect to the arts, a superior order of beings. Generally\r\nspeaking, their thoughts, their feelings and language, differ entirely\r\nfrom what they were sixty years ago. The state of the public mind,\r\nincapable of discriminating excellence from inferiority proved\r\nincontrovertibly that a right sense of art in the spectator can only be\r\nacquired by long and frequent observation, and that without proper\r\nopportunities to improve the mind and the eye, a nation would continue\r\ninsensible of the true value of the fine arts.\"\r\n\r\nIn view of these very pertinent observations it is worth inquiring a\r\nlittle as to the origin of exhibitions in England, and the stimulus\r\ngiven by them to British art before the institution of the Royal\r\nAcademy. From the introduction to book written by Edward Edwards, in\r\ncontinuation of Walpole's \"Anecdotes of Painters,\" and published in\r\n1808, I extract the following account of them, as far as possible using\r\nhis own quaint phraseology.\r\n\r\nAlthough the study of the human form had long been cultivated and\r\nencouraged in Italy and France by national schools or academies, yet in\r\nEngland until the eighteenth century such seminaries were unknown; and\r\nit is therefore difficult to trace the origin or ascertain the precise\r\nperiod when those nurseries of art were first attempted in this country,\r\nespecially as every establishment of that kind was, at first, of a\r\nprivate and temporary nature, depending chiefly upon the protection of\r\nsome artist of rank and reputation in his day. The first attempt towards\r\nthe establishment of an academy is mentioned by Walpole as having been\r\nformed by several artists under Sir Godfrey Kneller in 1711. Afterwards\r\nwe find, by other accounts in the same author, which are corroborated by\r\nauthentic information, that Sir James Thornhill formed an academy in his\r\nown house, in the Piazza, Covent Garden. But this was not of long\r\nduration, for it commenced in 1724 and died in 1734; which reduced the\r\nartists again to seek some new seminary; for the public of that day were\r\nso little acquainted with the use of such schools, that they were even\r\nsuspected of being held for immoral purposes.\r\n\r\nAfter the death of Thornhill a few of the artists (chiefly foreigners),\r\nfinding themselves without the necessary example of the living model,\r\nformed a small society and established their regular meetings of study\r\nin a convenient apartment in Greyhound Court, Arundel Street. The\r\nprincipal conductor of this school was Michael Moser, who when the Royal\r\nAcademy was established was appointed keeper. Here they were visited by\r\nartists such as Hogarth, Wills, and Ellis, who were so well pleased with\r\nthe propriety of their conduct, and so thoroughly convinced of the\r\nutility of the institution, that a general union took place, and the\r\nmembers thereby becoming numerous, they required and sought for a more\r\nconvenient situation and accommodation for their school. By the year\r\n1739 they were settled in Peter's Court, St Martin's Lane, where the\r\nstudy of the human figure was carried on till 1767, when they removed to\r\nPall Mall.\r\n\r\nBut a permanent and conspicuous establishment was still wanting, and on\r\nthis account the principal artists had several meetings with a view to\r\nforming a public academy. This they did not succeed in doing; but they\r\nwere so far from being discouraged that they continued their meetings\r\nand their studies, and the next effort they made towards acquiring the\r\nattention of the public was connected with the Foundling Hospital. This\r\ninstitution was incorporated in 1739, and a few years later the present\r\nbuilding was erected; but as the income of the charity could not, with\r\npropriety, be expended upon decorations, many of the principal artists\r\nof that day voluntarily exerted their talents for the purpose of\r\nornamenting several apartments of the Hospital which otherwise must\r\nhave remained without decoration. The pictures thus produced, and\r\ngenerously given, were permitted to be seen by any visitor upon proper\r\napplication. The spectacle was so new that it made a considerable\r\nimpression upon the public, and the favourable reception these works\r\nexperienced impressed the artists with an idea of forming a public\r\nexhibition, which scheme was carried into full effect with the help of\r\nthe Society for the Encouragement of Arts, Manufactures and Commerce,\r\nwho lent their great room for the purpose.\r\n\r\nThe success of this, the first, public display of art was more than\r\nequal to the general expectation. Yet there were some circumstances,\r\nconsequent to the arrangement of the pictures, with which the artists\r\nwere very justly dissatisfied; they were occasioned by the following\r\nimproprieties. The Society in the same year had offered premiums for the\r\nbest painting of history and landscape, and it was one of the conditions\r\nthat the pictures produced by the candidates should remain in their\r\ngreat room for a certain time; consequently they were blended with the\r\nrest, and formed part of the exhibition. As soon as it was known which\r\nperformances had obtained the premiums, it was naturally supposed, by\r\nsuch persons who were deficient in judgment, that those pictures were\r\nthe best in the room, and consequently deserved the chief attention.\r\nThis partial, though unmerited, selection gave displeasure to the\r\nartists in general. Nor were they pleased with the mode of admitting the\r\nspectators, for every member of the Society had the discretionary\r\nprivilege of introducing as many persons as he chose, by means of\r\ngratuitous tickets; and consequently the company was far from being\r\nselect, or suited to the wishes of the exhibition. These circumstances,\r\ntogether with the interference of the Society in the concern of the\r\nexhibition, determined the principal artists to withdraw themselves,\r\nwhich they did in the next year.\r\n\r\nEncouraged by the success of their first attempt, they engaged the great\r\nroom in Spring Garden, and their first exhibition at that place opened\r\non the 9th May 1761. Here they found it necessary to change their mode\r\nof admission, which they did by making the catalogue the ticket of\r\nadmission; consequently one catalogue would admit a whole family in\r\nsuccession, for a shilling, which was its price; but this mode of\r\nadmittance was still productive of crowd and disorder, and it was\r\ntherefore altered the next year. This exhibition, which was the second\r\nin this country, contained several works of the best English artists,\r\namong which many of the pictures were equal to any masters then living\r\nin Europe; and so strikingly conspicuous were their merits, and so\r\nforcible was the effect of this display of art, that it drew from the\r\npen of Roubilliac, the sculptor, the following lines, which were stuck\r\nup in the exhibition room, and were also printed in the _St James's\r\nChronicle_:--\r\n\r\n    Prétendu Connoiseur qui sur l'Antique glose,\r\n    Idolatrant le hom, sans connoitre la Chose,\r\n    Vrai Peste des beaux Arts, sans Gout sans Equité,\r\n    Quitez ce ton pedant, ce mépris affecté,\r\n    Pour tout ce que le Tems n'a pas encore gaté.\r\n\r\n    Ne peus tu pas, en admirant\r\n    Les Maitres de la Grece, ceux d l'Italie\r\n    Rendre justice également\r\n    A ceux qu'a nourris ta Patrie?\r\n\r\n    Vois ce Salon, et tu perdras\r\n    Cette prévention injuste,\r\n    Et bien étonné conviendras\r\n    Qu'il ne faut pas qu'un Mecenas\r\n    Pour revoir le Siècle d'Auguste.\r\n\r\n\"In the following season,\" says Edwards, \"they ventured to fix the price\r\nof _admission_ at one shilling each person, but had the precaution to\r\naffix a conciliatory preface to their catalogue, which was given\r\ngratis,\" As it is becoming more and more usual of late years to preface\r\na catalogue with a signed article, or, as in a recent instance, a\r\nfacsimile letter, it is interesting to know that this \"conciliatory\r\npreface\" was written by Dr Johnson. As a document its value in the\r\nhistory of the British School of Painting demands its reproduction here\r\nin full:--\r\n\r\n\"The public may justly require to be informed of the nature and extent\r\nof every design for which the favour of the public is openly solicited.\r\nThe artists who were themselves the first promoters of an exhibition in\r\nthis nation, and who have now contributed to the following catalogue,\r\nthink it therefore necessary to explain their purpose, and justify their\r\nconduct. An exhibition of the works of art being a spectacle new in this\r\nkingdom, has raised various opinions and conjectures among those who are\r\nunacquainted with the practice in foreign nations. Those who set their\r\nperformances to general view, have been too often considered as the\r\nrivals of each other; as men actuated, if not by avarice, at least by\r\nvanity, and contending for superiority of fame, though not for a\r\npecuniary prize. It cannot be denied or doubted, that all who offer\r\nthemselves to criticism are desirous of praise; this desire is not only\r\ninnocent but virtuous, while it is undebased by artifice, and unpolluted\r\nby envy; and of envy or artifice those men can never be accused, who\r\nalready enjoying all the honours and profits of their profession are\r\ncontent to stand candidates for public notice, with genius yet\r\nunexperienced, and diligence yet unrewarded; who without any hope of\r\nincreasing their own reputation or interest, expose their names and\r\ntheir works, only that they may furnish an opportunity of appearance to\r\nthe young, the diffident, and the neglected. The purpose of this\r\nexhibition is not to enrich the artist, but to advance the art; the\r\neminent are not flattered with preference, nor the obscure insulted with\r\ncontempt; whoever hopes to deserve public favour, is here invited to\r\ndisplay his merit. Of the price put upon this exhibition some account\r\nmay be demanded. Whoever sets his work to be shewn, naturally desires a\r\nmultitude of spectators; but his desire defeats its own end, when\r\nspectators assemble in such numbers as to obstruct one another.\r\n\r\n\"Though we are far from wishing to diminish the pleasures, or to\r\ndepreciate the sentiments of any class of the community, we know,\r\nhowever, what every one knows, that all cannot be judges or purchasers\r\nof works of art. Yet we have already found by experience, that all are\r\ndesirous to see an exhibition. When the terms of admission were low, our\r\nroom was throng'd with such multitudes, as made access dangerous, and\r\nfrightened away those, whose approbation was most desired.\r\n\r\n\"Yet because it is seldom believed that money is got but for the love of\r\nmoney, we shall tell the use which we intend to make of our expected\r\nprofits. Many artists of great abilities are unable to sell their works\r\nfor their due price; to remove this inconvenience, an annual sale will\r\nbe appointed, to which every man may send his works, and send them, if\r\nhe will, without his name. These works will be reviewed by the committee\r\nthat conduct the exhibition; a price will be secretly set on every\r\npiece, and registered by the secretary; if the piece exposed for sale is\r\nsold for more, the whole price shall be the artist's; but if the\r\npurchasers value it at less than\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PLATE XL.--SIR JOSHUA REYNOLDS\r\n\r\nTHE AGE OF INNOCENCE\r\n\r\n_National Gallery, London_]\r\n\r\nthe committee, the artist shall be paid the deficiency from the profits\r\nof the exhibition.\"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThis mode of admission was found to answer all the wished-for purposes,\r\nand the visitors, who were highly respectable, were also perfectly\r\ngratified with the display of art, which, for the first time, they\r\nbeheld with ease and pleasure to themselves.\r\n\r\nThe exhibition, thus established, continued at Spring Garden Room, under\r\nthe direction and management of the principal artists by whom it was\r\nfirst promoted, and they were soon also joined by many of those who had\r\ncontinued to exhibit in the Strand (_i.e._ at the Society of Arts,\r\netc.), which party being mostly composed of young men, and others who\r\nchose to become candidates for the premiums given by the Society,\r\nthought it prudent to remain under their protection. But the Society\r\nfinding that those who continued with them began to diminish in their\r\nnumbers, and that the exhibition interfered with their own concerns, no\r\nlonger indulged them with the use of their room, and the exhibitions at\r\nthat place terminated in 1764. These artists, who were mostly the\r\nyounger part of the profession at that time, thereupon engaged a large\r\nroom in Maiden Lane, where they exhibited in 1765 and 1766. But this\r\nsituation not being favourable, they engaged with Mr Christie, in\r\nbuilding his room near Pall Mall, and the agreement was that they should\r\nhave it for their use during one month every year, in the spring. Here\r\nthey contrived to support a feeble exhibition for eight years, when\r\ntheir engagements interfering with Mr Christie's auctions, he purchased\r\ntheir share of the premises, and they made their last removal to a room\r\nin S. Alban's Street, where they exhibited the next season, but never\r\nafter attempted to attract public notice. It may be observed that while\r\nthis Society continued there were annually three exhibitions of the\r\nworks of English artists, namely, the Royal Academy, the Chartered\r\nSociety, and that last mentioned, the members of which styled themselves\r\nthe Free Society of Artists. Their exhibition was considerably inferior\r\nto those of their rivals. By the Chartered Society, Edwards means the\r\nartists who formed the exhibition at the Spring Garden Room, who in 1765\r\nobtained a Charter from the king. Owing partly to internal\r\ndisagreements, but more no doubt to the foundation of the Royal Academy\r\nin 1768, this Society gradually diminished in importance, until Edwards\r\ncould write of their exhibition in 1791 that \"the articles they had then\r\ncollected were very insignificant, most of which could not be considered\r\nas works of art; such as pieces of needlework, subjects in human hair,\r\ncut paper, and such similar productions as deserve not the\r\nrecommendation of a public exhibition,\"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nTo the first exhibition of the Royal Academy, which was opened on the\r\n2nd of January 1769, Reynolds sent three pictures:--\r\n\r\n_The Duchess of Manchester and her son, as Diana disarming Cupid._\r\n\r\n_Lady Blake, as Juno receiving the Cestus of Venus._\r\n\r\n_Miss Morris as Hope nursing Love._\r\n\r\nThat all of them were, so to speak, \"fancy portraits\" is not entirely\r\nwithout significance. Portraiture, the painters bread and butter, was\r\napparently deemed hardly suitable for the occasion, and among a list of\r\nthe pictures which attracted most attention Northcote only includes the\r\nportraits of the _King and Queen_ by Nathaniel Dance, _Lady Molyneux_ by\r\nGainsborough, and the _Duke of Gloucester_ by Cotes. The rest are as\r\nfollows:--_The Departure of Regulus from Rome_, and _Venus lamenting the\r\nDeath of Adonis_, by Benjamin West; _Hector and Andromache_, and _Venus\r\ndirecting Aeneas and Achates_, by Angelica Kauffmann; _A Piping Boy_,\r\nand _A Candlelight Piece_, by Nathaniel Hone; _An Altar-Piece_ of the\r\nAnnunciation by Cipriani; _Hebe_, and _A Boy Playing Cricket_, by Cotes;\r\nA landscape by Barrett, and _Shakespeare's Black-smith_, by Penny.\r\n\r\nIn all, Reynolds exhibited two hundred and fifty-two pictures during the\r\nthirty-two years of his life in which exhibitions existed, namely from\r\n1760 to 1791; of which two hundred and twenty-eight went to the Royal\r\nAcademy.\r\n\r\nOf these, or most of them, ample records and criticisms may be found in\r\nthe copious literature which has grown up around his name. For our\r\npresent purpose a glance at his influence, his methods, and his\r\ncircumstances has seemed to me to be more in point, and as a succinct\r\nestimate of the man and his work from one of his most illustrious\r\ncontemporaries, the following passage may be added by way of\r\nconclusion:--\r\n\r\n\"Sir Joshua Reynolds,\" wrote Edmund Burke six years after the painter's\r\ndeath, \"was on very many accounts one of the most memorable men of his\r\ntime. He was the first Englishman who added the praise of the elegant\r\narts to the other glories of his country. In taste, in grace, in\r\nfacility, in happy invention, and in the richness and harmony of\r\ncolouring, he was equal to the great masters of the renowned ages. In\r\nportraiture he went beyond them, for he communicated to that description\r\nof the art, in which English artists are the most engaged, a fancy and a\r\ndignity derived from the higher branches, which even those who\r\nprofessed, them in a superior manner, did not always preserve when they\r\ndelineated individual nature. His portraits remind the spectator of the\r\ninvention of history and the amenity of landscape. In painting portraits\r\nhe appeared not to be raised upon that platform, but to descend to it\r\nfrom a higher sphere. His paintings illustrate his lessons, and his\r\nlessons seem to be derived from his paintings. He possessed the theory\r\nas perfectly as the practice of his art. To be such a painter, he was a\r\nprofound and penetrating philosopher.\"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nTHOMAS GAINSBOROUGH (1727-1788), whose name we can seldom help thinking\r\nof whenever we hear that of Reynolds, was in many ways the very\r\nantithesis of his more illustrious rival. In his private life he most\r\ncertainly was, and so far as his practical influence on his\r\ncontemporaries is concerned, he is altogether overshadowed by the first\r\nPresident of the Royal Academy. With respect to their works there is a\r\ndiversity of opinion, and it is largely a matter of personal feeling\r\nwhether we prefer those of the one or of the other. Both were great\r\nartists, and on the common ground of portraiture they contended so\r\nequally, and in some cases with such similarity of method, that it is\r\nimpossible to say impartially which was the greater. How is it possible\r\nto decide except on the ground of individual taste, as to whether we\r\nwould rather lose Gainsborough or Reynolds as a portrait painter,\r\nwithout considering for a moment that the former was a great landscape\r\npainter as well? And, putting aside Wilson, whose landscape was\r\nessentially Italian, whether executed in Italy or not, the first\r\nlandscape painter in England was Gainsborough. We are so accustomed to\r\nbracket him with Reynolds as a great portrait painter, so thrilled over\r\nthe sale of a Gainsborough portrait for many thousands of pounds, that\r\nwe are apt to forget him altogether as a landscape painter. And yet two\r\nor three of his best works in the National Gallery are landscapes, and\r\ntwo of them at least famous ones--_The Market Cart_ and _The Watering\r\nPlace_. How many more beautiful landscapes by him there must be in\r\nexistence it is impossible to say, but there can be no doubt that there\r\nare not a few which are only waiting their turn for a fashionable\r\nmarket, but are now reposing unappreciated in private hands. In the\r\nMetropolitan Museum at New York is a splendid example, the like of which\r\nI have never seen in this country, but which is so much closer in\r\nfeeling to his numerous drawings and sketches in chalk or pencil that it\r\nis impossible to believe that no similar examples exist. If we could\r\nonly bring them to light!\r\n\r\nThe fact is that the state of society in the middle of the eighteenth\r\ncentury was, with all its brilliance and intellect, the cause of\r\nhampering the natural development of the three great painters of that\r\nperiod. Reynolds came back from his stay in Italy an ardent disciple of\r\nthe grand style, burning to follow the example of Raphael and\r\nMichelangelo. Romney, too, was all for Italian art, but looked further\r\nback, and worshipped the classics. Gainsborough was a born landscape\r\npainter, and his whole time was devoted, when he was not executing\r\ncommissions for portraits, to making sketches and studies of woods and\r\nvalleys and trees. But so bent on having their likenesses handed about\r\nwere the brilliant personages of their time, that Reynolds, Gainsborough\r\nand Romney were compelled in spite of themselves to turn their\r\nattention to portraiture, to the exclusion of every other branch of\r\ntheir art, and as portrait painters they have made themselves and their\r\ncountry famous.\r\n\r\nIn the numerous sketches and studies that Gainsborough has left us, we\r\ncan see how much we have lost in gaining his wonderful portraits. He\r\nloved landscape, from his earliest youth to his dying day. Loved it for\r\nitself. For among all the drawings of his which I have ever seen, I do\r\nnot remember one which can be identified as any particular place. In the\r\neighteenth century there was a perfect mania among the smaller fry for\r\nmaking topographical drawings, in pencil or water-colour, views of some\r\ntown or mountain or castle. But with Gainsborough the place was\r\nnothing--it was the spirit of it that charmed him. A cottage in a wood,\r\na glade, a country road, a valley, was to him a beautiful scene,\r\nwhatever it was called or wherever it happened to be, and out of it\r\naccordingly he made a beautiful picture, or at least a drawing. That his\r\npictures of landscape are so extraordinarily few while his drawings are\r\nso numerous, may be accounted for in a great measure by the exigences of\r\nportrait painting, but not entirely; and the probability is that there\r\nare many more which are now forgotten.\r\n\r\nFor an estimate of Thomas Gainsborough both in regard to his place in\r\nthe story of the English School and to the abilities and methods by\r\nwhich he attained it, it is needless to look elsewhere than to that of\r\nSir Joshua Reynolds, contained in the discourse delivered shortly after\r\nGainsborough's death:--\r\n\r\n\"When such a man as Gainsborough rises to great fame without the\r\nassistance of an academical education, without travelling to Italy, or\r\nany of those preparatory studies which have been so often recommended,\r\nhe is produced\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PLATE XLI.--THOMAS GAINSBOROUGH\r\n\r\nTHE MARKET CART\r\n\r\n_National Gallery, London_]\r\n\r\nas an instance how little such studies are necessary, since so great\r\nexcellence may be acquired without them. This is an inference not\r\nwarranted by the success of any individual, and I trust that it will not\r\nbe thought that I wish to make this use of it.\r\n\r\n\"It must be remembered that the style and department of art which\r\nGainsborough chose, and in which he so much excelled, did not require\r\nthat he should go out of his own country for the objects of his study;\r\nthey were everywhere about him; he found them in the streets, and in the\r\nfields; and from the models thus accidentally found he selected with\r\ngreat judgment such as suited his purpose. As his studies were directed\r\nto the living world principally, he did not pay a general attention to\r\nthe works of the various masters, though they are, in my opinion, always\r\nof great use even when the character of our subject requires us to\r\ndepart from some of their principles. It cannot be denied that\r\nexcellence in the department of the art which he professed may exist\r\nwithout them, that in such subjects and in the manner that belongs to\r\nthem the want of them is supplied, and more than supplied, by natural\r\nsagacity and a minute observation of particular nature. If Gainsborough\r\ndid not look at nature with a poet's eye, it must be acknowledged that\r\nhe saw her with the eye of a painter; and gave a faithful, if not a\r\npoetical, representation of what he had before him.\r\n\r\n\"Though he did not much attend to the works of the great historical\r\npainters of former ages, yet he was well aware that the language of the\r\nart--the art of imitation--must be learned somewhere; and as he knew he\r\ncould not learn it in an equal degree from his contemporaries, he very\r\njudiciously applied himself to the Flemish school, who are undoubtedly\r\nthe greatest masters of one necessary branch of art, and he did not\r\nneed to go out of his country for examples of that school; from _that_\r\nhe learned the harmony of colouring, the management and disposition of\r\nlight and shadow, and every means of it which the masters practised to\r\nornament and give splendour to their works. And to satisfy himself, as\r\nwell as others, how well he knew the mechanism and artifice which they\r\nemployed to bring out that tone of colour which we so much admire in\r\ntheir works, he occasionally made copies from Rubens, Teniers and Van\r\nDyck, which it would be no disgrace to the most accurate connoisseur to\r\nmistake at the first sight for the works of those masters. What he thus\r\nlearned he applied to the originals of nature, which he saw with his own\r\neyes, and imitated not in the manner of those masters but in his own.\r\n\r\n\"Whether he most excelled in portraits, landscapes, or fancy pictures,\r\nit is difficult to determine; whether his portraits were most admirable\r\nfor exact truth of resemblance, or his landscapes for a portrait-like\r\nrepresentation of nature, such as we see in the works of Rubens,\r\nRuisdael, or others of those schools. In his fancy pictures, when he had\r\nfixed on his object of imitation, whether it was the mean and vulgar\r\nform of the woodcutter, or a child of an interesting character, as he\r\ndid not attempt to raise the one, so neither did he lose any of the\r\nnatural grace and elegance of the other; such a grace and such an\r\nelegance as are more frequently found in cottages than in courts. This\r\nexcellence was his own, the result of his particular observation and\r\ntaste; for this he was certainly not indebted to the Flemish school, nor\r\nindeed to any school; for his grace was not academic, or antique, but\r\nselected by himself from the great school of nature....\r\n\r\n\"Upon the whole we may justly say that whatever he attempted he carried\r\nto a high degree of excellence. It is to the credit of his good sense\r\nand judgment that he never did attempt that style of historical painting\r\nfor which his previous studies had made no preparation.\r\n\r\n\"The peculiarity of his manner or style,\" Reynolds continues a little\r\nlater, \"or we may call it the language in which he expressed his ideas,\r\nhas been considered by many as his greatest defect.... A novelty and\r\npeculiarity of manner, as it is often a cause of our approbation, so\r\nlikewise it is often a ground of censure, as being contrary to the\r\npractice of other painters, in whose manner we have been initiated, and\r\nin whose favour we have perhaps been prepossessed from our infancy: for\r\nfond as we are of novelty, we are upon the whole creatures of habit.\r\nHowever, it is certain that all those odd scratches and marks which on a\r\nclose examination are so observable in Gainsborough's pictures, and\r\nwhich even to experienced painters appear rather the effect of accident\r\nthan design; this chaos, this uncouth and shapeless appearance, by a\r\nkind of magic, at a certain distance assumes form, and all the parts\r\nseem to drop into their proper places; so that we can hardly refuse\r\nacknowledging the full effect of diligence under the appearance of\r\nchance and hasty negligence.\r\n\r\n\"That Gainsborough himself considered this peculiarity in his manner,\r\nand the power it possesses of exciting surprise, as a beauty in his\r\nworks, I think may be inferred from the eager desire which we know he\r\nalways expressed, that his pictures at the exhibition should be seen\r\nnear as well as at a distance.\r\n\r\n\"The slightness which we see in his best works cannot always be imputed\r\nto negligence. However they may appear to superficial observers,\r\npainters know very well that a steady attention to the general effect\r\ntakes up more time and is much more laborious to the mind than any mode\r\nof high finishing or smoothness without such attention. His handling,\r\nthe manner of leaving the colours, or, in other words, the methods he\r\nused for producing the effect, had very much the appearance of the work\r\nof an artist who had never learnt from others the usual and regular\r\npractice belonging to the art; but still, like a man of strong intuitive\r\nperception of what was required, he found a way of his own to accomplish\r\nhis purpose.\"\r\n\r\nTo Reynolds's opinion of this technique as applied to portraits, we may\r\nlisten with even more attention. \"It must be allowed,\" he continues,\r\n\"that this hatching manner of Gainsborough did very much contribute to\r\nthe lightness of effect which is so eminent a beauty in his pictures;\r\nas, on the contrary, much smoothness and uniting the colours is apt to\r\nproduce heaviness. Every artist must have remarked how often that\r\nlightness of hand which was in his dead-colour (or first painting)\r\nescaped in the finishing when he had determined the parts with more\r\nprecision; and another loss which he often experiences, which is of\r\ngreater consequence: while he is employed in the detail, the effect of\r\nthe whole together is either forgotten or neglected. The likeness of a\r\nportrait, as I have formerly observed, consists more in preserving the\r\ngeneral effect of the countenance than in the most minute finishing of\r\nthe features or any of the particular parts. Now, Gainsborough's\r\nportraits were often little more in regard to finishing or determining\r\nthe form of the features, than what generally attends a first painting;\r\nbut as he was always attentive to the general effect, or whole\r\ntogether, I have often imagined that this unfinished manner contributed\r\neven to that striking resemblance for which his portraits are so\r\nremarkable.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIV\r\n\r\nTHE CLOSE OF THE EIGHTEENTH CENTURY\r\n\r\n\r\nNot until the year of Gainsborough's death, 1788, was there born another\r\nlandscape painter. This was JOHN CROME, and he too came from the east of\r\nEngland, nearest to Holland, being born in Norfolk, the neighbouring\r\ncounty to Gainsborough's native Suffolk. Within ten years more, two\r\nstill greater landscapists were born, also in the east, Constable in\r\nEssex, still closer to Sudbury, and Turner in London.\r\n\r\nJohn Crome--Old Crome, as he is usually called to distinguish him from\r\nhis less distinguished son, John Bernay Crome--was born at Norwich, and\r\nhad to support himself most of his life by teaching drawing, not to\r\nprofessional pupils unfortunately; but incidentally he founded \"The\r\nNorwich School\" of landscape painters, who loyally carried forward the\r\ntraditions he had inculcated. But having to spend his time as a\r\ndrawing-master, he was not free like the old Dutch painters to put out\r\npictures when and as often as he would, and his work in oils is\r\ntherefore comparatively scarce. The three examples at the National\r\nGallery are typical of his varied powers, _The Slate Quarries_,\r\n_Household Heath_, and _Porringland Oak_ are all of them masterpieces.\r\n\r\nJOHN SELL COTMAN, born in 1782, was, after Crome, the most considerable\r\nof the Norwich School. He, too, was compelled to earn a livelihood by\r\nbeing a drawing-master, for there was not as yet a sufficient market,\r\nnor for some time later, for landscape pictures, to support existence,\r\nhowever humble. Cotman devoted much of his energies to water-colours,\r\nand he is better known in this branch of the art than in painting; that\r\nis the only excuse for the National Gallery in having purchased as his\r\nthe very inferior picture called _A Galliot in a Gale_. The other\r\nexample, _Wherries on the Yare_, is more worthy of him, though it by no\r\nmeans exhibits all his wonderful power and fascination.\r\n\r\nIn GEORGE MORLAND (1763-1804) we have something more and something less\r\nthan a landscape painter. Landscape to him was not what it was to\r\nWilson, Gainsborough or Crome,--the only end in view; nor was it merely\r\na background for his subjects. But, as it generally happened, it was\r\nboth. To Morland, the landscape and the figures were one and the same\r\nthing. Out of the fulness of his heart he painted pictures of _Boys\r\nRobbing an Orchard_, _Horses in a Stable_, or a _Farmer on Horseback_\r\nstaying to talk to a group of gypsies beside a wood, and whether or not\r\nthe picture might be classed as a landscape depended entirely on the\r\nnature of the scene itself. Whatever he saw or chose to see he painted\r\nwith equal skill and with equal charm; and as his choice of vision lay\r\nin the simple everyday life that surrounded him, his variety is not the\r\nleast of his attractions.\r\n\r\nThe fact that his mother was a Frenchwoman (his father was Henry\r\nMorland, the painter of the delightful pair of half-lengths, _The\r\nLaundry Maids_) suggests to my mind the wild surmise that she may have\r\nbeen the daughter of Chardin. For in the technique as well as in the\r\ntemperament of Morland,--making allowance for difference of\r\ncircumstances,--there is something remarkably akin to those of the great\r\nFrenchman. Both eschewed the temptation to become fashionable, both\r\npainted the humble realities of middle-class life with a zest that could\r\nnot possibly have been affected, and both painted them with much the\r\nsame extraordinary charm. At his best, Morland is not much inferior to\r\nChardin, and but for his unfortunate wildness and his susceptibility to\r\nthe temptations of strong drink, he might easily have excelled the\r\nother. The feeling exhibited in two such different subjects as Lord\r\nGlenconner's _Boys Robbing an Orchard_, and _The Interior of a Stable_,\r\nin the National Gallery, certainly equals that of Chardin's most famous\r\npieces, I mean the feeling for the particular scene he is depicting. The\r\nnearest, in fact the only, approach that Morland made to portrait\r\npainting was in such pieces as _The Fortune Teller_ in the National\r\nGallery, which brings to mind the \"Conversation Pieces,\" introduced by\r\nHogarth and Highmore into English painting, but which were never widely\r\nattempted. In the Portfolio monograph \"English Society in the Eighteenth\r\nCentury\" I tried to collect as many examples as I could of this form of\r\nart, but found it difficult to fill even a small volume, so entirely was\r\nthe single figure portrait the vogue. A few notable instances are worth\r\nmentioning, if only as exceptions to the general rule. Gainsborough's\r\n_Ladies Walking in the Mall_, belonging to Sir Audley Neeld; Reynolds's\r\nlarge group of _The Marlborough Family_ at Blenheim, and a very early\r\ngroup of _The Elliott Family_, consisting of eleven figures, belonging\r\nto Lord St Germans; John Singleton Copley's _Children of Francis\r\nSitwell, Esq._, at Renishaw; and lastly Zoffany's _Family Party_, at\r\nPanshanger.\r\n\r\nFor life-like representation of the English people we look to Hogarth\r\nand Morland, and yet nothing could be more different than the motives\r\nwhich inspired the two, and the way they went to work upon their\r\nsubject. Hogarth was above all things theatrical, Morland natural.\r\nHogarth first conceived his idea, then laid his scene, and lastly\r\npeopled it with actual characters as they appeared--individually--before\r\nhim. Morland simply looked about him and painted what he happened to see\r\nat the precise moment when what he saw coincided with his natural\r\ninclination, or we may even say inspiration, to paint it. It was much\r\nthe same difference as between the work of Zola and that of Thomas\r\nHardy. The one had a moral to preach, the other a story to tell.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nWhen the most we hear of GEORGE ROMNEY nowadays is the price that has\r\nbeen paid for one of his portraits at Christie's, it is refreshing as\r\nwell as informative to turn to the criticism of one of his greatest\r\nthough not in these times so highly priced contemporaries, I mean John\r\nFlaxman. \"When Romney first began to paint,\" he writes, \"he had seen no\r\ngallery of pictures nor the fine productions of ancient sculpture; but\r\nthen women and children were his statues, and all objects under the\r\ncanopy of heaven formed his school of painting. The rainbow, the purple\r\ndistance, or the silver lake, taught him colouring; the various actions\r\nand passions of the human figure, with the forms of clouds, woods, and\r\nmountains or valleys, afforded him studies of composition. Indeed, his\r\ngenius bore a strong resemblance to the scenes he was born in; like\r\nthem, it partook of the grand and beautiful; and like them also, the\r\nbright sunshine and enchanting prospects of his fancy were occasionally\r\noverspread with mist and gloom. On his arrival in Italy he was witness\r\nto new scenes of art and sources of study of which he could only have\r\nsupposed previously that something\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PLATE XLII.--GEORGE ROMNEY\r\n\r\nTHE PARSON'S DAUGHTER\r\n\r\n_National Gallery, London_]\r\n\r\nof the kind might exist; for he there contemplated the purity and\r\nperfection of ancient sculpture, the sublimity of Michelangelo's Sistine\r\nChapel, and the simplicity of Cimabue and Giotto's schools. He perceived\r\nthose qualities distinctly, and judiciously used them in viewing and\r\nimitating nature; and thus his quick perception and unwearied\r\napplication enabled him, by a two years' residence abroad, to acquire as\r\ngreat a proficiency in art as is usually attained by foreign studies of\r\na much longer duration.\r\n\r\n\"After his return, the novelty and sentiment of his original subjects\r\nwere universally admired. Most of these were of the delicate class, and\r\neach had its peculiar character. Titania with her Indian votaries was\r\narch and sprightly; Milton dictating to his daughters, solemn and\r\ninteresting. Several pictures of Wood Nymphs and Bacchantes charmed by\r\ntheir rural beauty, innocence, and simplicity. The most pathetic,\r\nperhaps, of all his works was never finished--Ophelia with the flowers\r\nshe had gathered in her hand, sitting on the branch of a tree, which was\r\nbreaking under her, whilst the moody distraction in her lovely\r\ncountenance accounts for the insensibility to danger. Few painters have\r\nleft so many examples in their works of the tender and delicate\r\naffections; and several of his pictures breathe a kindred spirit with\r\nthe _Sigismonda_ of Correggio. His cartoons, some of which have\r\nunfortunately perished, were examples of the sublime and terrible, at\r\nthat time perfectly new in English art. As Romney was gifted with\r\npeculiar powers for historical and ideal painting, so his heart and soul\r\nwere engaged in the pursuit of it whenever he could extricate himself\r\nfrom the importunate business of portrait painting. It was his delight\r\nby day and study by night, and for this his food and rest were often\r\nneglected. His compositions, like those of the ancient pictures and\r\nbasso-relievos, told their story by a single group of figures in the\r\nfront, whilst the background is made the simplest possible, rejecting\r\nall unnecessary episode and trivial ornament, either of secondary groups\r\nor architectural subdivision. In his compositions the beholder was\r\nforcibly struck by the sentiment at the first glance: the gradations and\r\nvarieties of which he traced through several characters, all conceived\r\nin an elevated spirit of dignity and beauty, with a lively expression of\r\nnature in all the parts. His heads were various--the male were decided\r\nand grand, the female lovely. His figures resembled the antique--the\r\nlimbs were elegant and finely formed. His drapery was well understood,\r\neither forming the figure into a mass with one or two deep folds only,\r\nor by its adhesion and transparency discovering the form of the figure,\r\nthe lines of which were finely varied with the union or expansion of\r\nspiral or cascade folds, composing with or contrasting the outline and\r\nchiaroscuro. Few artists since the fifteenth century have been able to\r\ndo so much in so many different branches; for besides his beautiful\r\ncompositions and pictures, which have added to the knowledge and\r\ncelebrity of the English School, he modelled like a sculptor, carved\r\nornaments in wood with great delicacy, and could make an architectural\r\ndesign in a fine taste, as well as construct every part of the\r\nbuilding.\"\r\n\r\nAfter the death of Reynolds and the retirement of Romney, in the last\r\ndecade of the eighteenth century, the field of portraiture was left\r\nvacant--in London at least--for JOHN HOPPNER, whose name is now\r\ngenerally included with those of Lawrence and Raeburn among the first\r\nsix portrait painters of the British\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PLATE XLIII.--GEORGE ROMNEY\r\n\r\nMRS ROBINSON--\"PERDITA\"\r\n\r\n_Hertford House, London_]\r\n\r\nSchool. His fame in recent years has certainly exceeded his merits, but\r\nit is due to him to say that he was a conscientious artist, and a firm\r\nupholder of the tradition of Reynolds, so far as in him lay. The old\r\nKing had always disliked Reynolds, and Hoppner was not well enough\r\nadvised to hold his tongue on the subject of the master: worse than\r\nthis, he openly accepted the patronage of the Prince of Wales, and by so\r\ndoing opened the door for the admission of Lawrence as royal painter\r\nmuch sooner than was at all necessary. The story of their rivalry is\r\nthus--in substance--sketched by Allan Cunningham, their\r\ncontemporary:--The light of the Prince of Wales's countenance was of\r\nitself sufficient to guide the courtly and beautiful to Hoppner's easel.\r\nSuffice it to say that before he was forty years of age (he was born in\r\n1759), he had been enabled to exhibit no less than fifteen ladies of\r\nquality--for so are they named in the catalogues--a score of ladies of\r\nlower degree, and noblemen unnumbered. But by this time another star had\r\narisen, destined to outshine that of Hoppner; though some at that\r\nperiod, willing to flatter the older practitioner, called it a meteor\r\nthat would but flash and disappear--we allude to Lawrence. Urged upon\r\nthe Academy by the King and Queen, and handed up to public notice by\r\nroyal favour, this new aspirant rose rapidly in the estimation of the\r\npublic; and by the most delicate flattery, both with tongue and pencil,\r\nbecame a formidable rival to the painter whom it was the Prince's\r\npleasure to befriend. The factions of Reynolds and Romney seemed revived\r\nin those of Hoppner and Lawrence. If Hoppner resided in Charles Street,\r\nat the gates of Carlton House, and wrote himself \"portrait painter to\r\nthe Prince of Wales,\" Lawrence likewise had his residence in the Court\r\nend of the town, and proudly styled himself--and that when only\r\ntwenty-three years old--\"portrait painter in ordinary to His Majesty.\"\r\nIn other respects, too, were honours equally balanced between them; they\r\nwere both made Royal Academicians, but in this, youth had the start of\r\nage--Lawrence obtained that distinction first. Nature, too, had been\r\nkind--some have said prodigal--to both; they were men of fine address,\r\nand polished by early intercourse with the world and by their trade of\r\nportrait painting could practise all the delicate courtesies of\r\ndrawing-room and boudoir; but in that most fascinating of all flattery,\r\nthe art of persuading, with brushes and fine colours, very ordinary\r\nmortals that beauty and fine expression were their portions, Lawrence\r\nwas soon without a rival.\r\n\r\nThe preference of the King and Queen for Lawrence was for a time\r\nbalanced by the affection of the Prince of Wales for Hoppner; the Prince\r\nwas supposed to have the best taste, and as he kept a court of his own\r\nfilled with the young nobility, and all the wits of that great faction\r\nknown by the name of Whig, Hoppner had the youth and beauty of the land\r\nfor a time; and it cannot be denied that he was a rival in every way\r\nworthy of contending with any portrait-painter of his day. The bare list\r\nof his exhibited portraits will show how and by whom he was supported.\r\nIt is well said by Williams, in his _Life of Lawrence_, that \"the more\r\nsober and homely ideas of the King were not likely to be a passport for\r\nany portrait-painter to the variety of ladies, and hence Mr. Hoppner for\r\na long time almost monopolised the female beauty and young fashion of\r\nthe country.\"\r\n\r\nThis rivalry continued for a time in the spirit of moderation--but only\r\nfor a time. Lawrence, the gentler and the smoother of the two, kept\r\nsilence longest; the warm nature of Hoppner broke out at last. \"The\r\nladies of Lawrence,\" he said, \"show a gaudy dissoluteness of taste, and\r\nsometimes trespass on moral as well as professional decorum.\" For his\r\nown he claimed, by implication, purity of look as well as purity of\r\nstyle. This sarcastic remark found wings in a moment, and flew through\r\nall the coteries and through both courts; it did most harm to him who\r\nuttered it; all men laughed, and then began to wonder how Lawrence,\r\nlimner to perhaps the purest court in Europe, came to bestow indecorous\r\nlooks on the meek and sedate ladies of quality of St. James's and\r\nWindsor, while Hoppner, limner to the court of a gallant young prince,\r\nwho loved mirth and wine, the sound of the lute and the music of ladies'\r\nfeet in the dance, should to some of its gayest and giddiest ornaments\r\ngive the simplicity of manner and purity of style which pertained to the\r\nQuaker like sobriety of the other. Nor is it the least curious part of\r\nthe story that the ladies, from the moment of the sarcasm of Hoppner,\r\ninstead of crowding to the easel of him who dealt in the loveliness of\r\nvirtue, showed a growing preference for the rival who \"trespassed on\r\nmoral as well as on professional decorum.\" After this, Lawrence had\r\nplenty of the fairest sitters.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_THE NINETEENTH CENTURY_\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI\r\n\r\nTHE SPIRIT OF REVOLT\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the preceding chapters we have traced the development of painting for\r\nfive centuries--from the beginning of the fourteenth, that is to say, to\r\nthe end of the eighteenth--in Italy, in the Netherlands, in Germany, in\r\nSpain, and lastly in France and England. In the nineteenth the story is\r\nconfined to the last two alone, as with one or two minute exceptions the\r\nart of painting had by this time entirely ceased to be worth\r\nconsideration in any of the others. Only in France and England, where it\r\nhad been most recently established, was it to continue; and besides\r\ncontinuing, reach out with the most astonishing vigour to snatch at and\r\ngrasp fruits that no one before would have dreamt of being within its\r\nreach.\r\n\r\nBetween France and England--if by the latter we may be taken to mean\r\nGreat Britain, and include within its artists those who have\r\nacclimatised themselves within her shores--the honours of the\r\nachievement are pretty equally divided, though it will have to be left\r\nto individual choice to decide exactly on which side the balance of\r\ncredit is due. A mere list of the greatest names is not sufficient to\r\napportion the praise, though as a preliminary step it may be of value in\r\nclearing the issue. Let us take a dozen on either side, and see how they\r\nlook.\r\n\r\n_England._\r\n\r\nLawrence.\r\nConstable.\r\nTurner.\r\nDe Wint.\r\nNasmyth.\r\nStevens.\r\nWhistler.\r\nCotman.\r\nCox.\r\nWatts.\r\nRossetti.\r\nHunt.\r\n\r\n_France._\r\n\r\nDavid.\r\nGéricault.\r\nIngres.\r\nDelacroix.\r\nCorot.\r\nMillet.\r\nDaubigny.\r\nCourbet.\r\nDaumier.\r\nDecamps.\r\nManet.\r\nDegas.\r\n\r\nAmong these Turner stands out conspicuously from the rest, and he would\r\nbe included by anyone in a list of twenty, or perhaps a dozen, of the\r\ngreatest painters in the world. But oddly enough his influence on the\r\nart in general has been comparatively small, if we are to judge by its\r\neffects on other painters up to the present, while that of Constable has\r\nbeen considerably greater. Manet, again, and Delacroix, have\r\naccomplished far more for the history of painting than any other two in\r\nour lists--and yet their names are scarcely known outside the circle of\r\nthose who know anything at all about painting.\r\n\r\nFor the English public at large an entirely different list would\r\nprobably prove the superiority of their own race to their complete\r\nsatisfaction--in spite of Meissonier, Doré, and Bouguereau on the other\r\nside. But that is only because the British public, owing to the\r\nmonopoly\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PLATE XLIV.--JACQUES LOUIS DAVID\r\n\r\nPORTRAIT OF MME. RÉCAMIER\r\n\r\n_Louvre, Paris_]\r\n\r\nenjoyed by the Royal Academy, have never had a chance of judging for\r\nthemselves what they approve of and what they do not, and their taste\r\nhas been vitiated for generations by the exhibition of what this\r\nself-constituted authority, no doubt unconsciously, conceives to be best\r\nfor them--and which, as might be expected, is usually found to coincide\r\npretty nearly with the sort of thing they are capable of producing\r\nthemselves. Hogarth's predictions at the time the Academy was instituted\r\nhave in a great measure come perfectly true, and the only benefit that\r\nit has been to the English School of painting is that it has kept it\r\ngoing. How far this may be called a benefit is at least arguable, but in\r\nthe main it is probable that if so many bad pictures had not been\r\npainted, there would not have been so many good ones. On the other hand,\r\nthe removal of a man like Sir Lawrence Alma-Tadema from his native\r\nsphere of influence is quite enough to account for the unlooked-for\r\nflowering of blossoms like the brothers Maris, Bosboom, Israels, and\r\nMauve in the Dutch garden, and if that is so, one need not grudge him\r\nhis interment amongst Nelson, Wellington, and other heroes of our own.\r\n\r\nIn a word, the history of painting in the nineteenth century is Revolt.\r\nWhat it is going to be in the twentieth I am fortunately not called upon\r\nto say; but if I may throw out an opinion based upon what is already\r\nhappening, I should say that no word has yet been coined which will\r\nadequately express it.\r\n\r\nIn the last century the issues were simple, and can be easily expressed.\r\nOn the one side was the complacent body of practitioners following to\r\nthe best of their ability the practice of painting as handed down to\r\nthem in a variety of different forms, just as the Byzantine craftsmen\r\nearned their living when they were so rudely disturbed by Cimabue and\r\nhis school. On the other was a small but ever-increasing number of\r\nindividuals who, like Cimabue, began to think things out for themselves,\r\nbut, unlike him, did not succeed in effecting a popular triumph\r\nwithout--if at all--first raising both the painters and the public to a\r\npitch of fury. It is indeed curious to read Vasari and modern historians\r\nside by side, and to wonder if, after all, Vasari knew or told\r\neverything, in his desire to glorify the art, or whether Giotto and\r\nother innovators were not in fact burnt at the stake. Probably not.\r\nGallileo, as we know, and Savonarola suffered for their crimes. But they\r\nwere working against the Church, and the artists were working for it.\r\n\r\nIn the nineteenth century, painting had altogether broken away from the\r\nChurch, and so it had to fight its own battles out in the street, or in\r\nthe law courts. That is what has given it such a swagger and strength.\r\nIt no longer looks to its protector, it will hit you in the face before\r\nyou know where you are. The feeble kind, only, looks to Academies for\r\nsupport, and thereby becomes feebler still.\r\n\r\nIn the present chapter, accordingly, we shall hear no more of the\r\nMadonnas, the Holy Families, and all the sacred and profane subjects on\r\nwhich the old masters exercised their genius. Five centuries of painting\r\nhad established the art in a position of independence; and in a\r\nsixth--that is to say, the nineteenth--it began to assert itself, and to\r\nprove that its education was not in itself an end, but only a means to\r\nvarious ends. Instead of following out the fortunes of each painter,\r\ntherefore, and attempting to set in any sort of order the reputations of\r\nartists before sufficient time has elapsed for them to cool, I propose\r\nto confine myself in the remaining pages to the broad issues raised\r\nduring this period between the painters, the critics, and the public.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nII\r\n\r\nEUGÈNE DELACROIX\r\n\r\n\r\nThe man who began all this street fighting was a Frenchman--Eugène\r\nDelacroix. While still a youth he was bullied, and the bully was such a\r\nredoubtable giant that it took somebody with the grit and genius of\r\nDelacroix to tackle him, but tackle him he did. The story of the fight,\r\nwhich is a long and glorious one, is so admirably told in Madame Bussy's\r\nlife of Delacroix, that I have obtained permission to give the essence\r\nof it in her own words.\r\n\r\nIn the Salon of 1822 was exhibited Delacroix's picture of _Dante and\r\nVirgil_, which is now in the Louvre, and evoked the first of those\r\nclamours of abuse which were barely stilled before the artist's death.\r\nFor nearly thirty years all French painters, with the exception of Gros\r\nand Prudhon; had shown themselves unquestioning disciples of the school\r\nfounded by Jacques Louis David, whose masterful character and potent\r\npersonality had reduced all art to a system; and Delacroix himself spoke\r\nof him with sympathy and admiration. The chief dogma of David's school\r\nwas that the nearest approach to the _beau ideal_ permitted to the human\r\nrace had been attained by the Greeks, and that all art must conform as\r\nclosely as possible to theirs. Unfortunately, the chief specimens of\r\nGreek art known at that time were those belonging to a decadent\r\nperiod--neither the Elgin marbles nor the Venus of Milo were accessible\r\nbefore 1816--so that the works from which they drew their inspiration\r\nwere without character in themselves, or merely the feeble and\r\nattenuated copies of ancient Rome. In the pictures of this school,\r\naccordingly, we find only the monotonous perfection of rounded and\r\nwell-modelled limbs, classical features and straight noses. Colour, to\r\nthe sincere Davidian, was a vain and frivolous accessory, serving only\r\nto distract attention from the real purpose of the work, which was to\r\naim at moral elevation as well as at ideal beauty. Everything in the\r\npicture was to be equally dwelt upon; there was no sacrifice, no\r\nmystery. \"These pictures,\" says Delacroix, \"have no epidermis ...they\r\nlack the atmosphere, the lights, the reflections which blend into an\r\nharmonious whole, objects the most dissimilar in colour.\"\r\n\r\nBy the untimely death of Géricault, whose _Raft of the Medusa_ had\r\nalready caused a flutter in 1819, Delacroix was left at the head of the\r\nrevolt against this pseudo-classicism; and amid the storm that greeted\r\nthe _Dante and Virgil_ it is interesting to find Thiers writing of him\r\nin the following strain:--\"It seems to me that no picture [in the Salon]\r\nreveals the future of a great painter better than M. Delacroix's, in\r\nwhich we see an outbreak of talent, a burst of rising superiority which\r\nrevives the hopes that had been slightly discouraged by the too moderate\r\nmerits of all the rest.... I think I am not mistaken; M. Delacroix has\r\ngenius; let him go on with confidence, and devote himself to immense\r\nlabour, the indispensable condition of talent.\" Delécluze, by the by,\r\nthe critic-in-chief of the Davidian School, had characterised the\r\npicture as _une véritable tartouillade_.\r\n\r\nIn 1824 the Salon included two pictures which may be regarded as\r\nimportant documents in the history of painting. One of these was\r\nConstable's _Hay Wain_--now\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PLATE XLV.--EUGÈNE DELACROIX\r\n\r\nDANTE AND VIRGIL\r\n\r\n_Louvre, Paris_]\r\n\r\nin our National Gallery--which had been purchased by a Frenchman; the\r\nother was Delacroix's _Massacre of Scio_, the first to receive the\r\nenlightenment afforded by the Englishman's methods, which spread so\r\nwidely over the French School. It was said that Delacroix entirely\r\nrepainted his picture on seeing Constable's; but his pupil, Lassalle\r\nBordes, is probably nearer the truth in saying that the master being\r\ndissatisfied with its general tone, which was too chalky, transformed it\r\nby means of violent glazings. The critics were no less noisy over this\r\npicture than the last. \"A painter has been revealed to us,\" said one,\r\n\"but he is a man who runs along the housetops.\" \"Yes,\" answered\r\nBaudelaire, \"but for that one must have a sure foot, and an eye guided\r\nby an inward light.\"\r\n\r\nWhen the Salon opened again in 1827, after an interval of three years,\r\nthe public were astonished to find how large a number of painters had\r\nabandoned Davidism and openly joined the ranks of the enemy. Delacroix\r\nhimself exhibited the _Marino Faliero_ (now at Hertford House) and\r\neleven others. The gauntlet was flung down, and war began in deadly\r\nearnest between the opposing parties. It was at this time that the terms\r\nRomanticism and Romantic came into common use. Delacroix always resented\r\nbeing labelled as a Romantic, and would only acknowledge that the term\r\nmight be justly applied to him when used in its widest signification.\r\n\"If by my Romanticism,\" he wrote, \"is meant the free expression of my\r\npersonal impressions, my aversion from the stereotypes invariably\r\nproduced in the schools, and my repugnance to academic receipts, then I\r\nmust admit I am Romantic.\"\r\n\r\nHere we have the plain truth about the painting of the nineteenth\r\ncentury--and after! The critics were unanimous in their violent\r\ncondemnation of Delacroix's works: \"the compositions of a sick man in\r\ndelirium,\" \"the fanaticism of ugliness,\" \"barbarous execution,\" \"an\r\nintoxicated broom\"--such are some of the terms of abuse showered upon\r\nhim. The gentlest among them commiserate the talent which here and there\r\ncan be seen \"struggling with the systematic _bizarrerie_ and the\r\ndisordered technique of the artist, just as gleams of reason and\r\nsometimes flashes of genius may be seen pitiably shining through the\r\nspeech of a madman.\" The final touch to Delacroix's disgrace was given\r\nby the Directeur des Beaux Arts sending for him and recommending him to\r\nstudy drawing from casts, warning him at the same time that unless he\r\ncould change his style he must expect neither commissions nor\r\nrecognition from the State!\r\n\r\nThe year 1830 has given its name to that brilliant generation of poets,\r\nnovelists, painters and philosophers which, as Théophile Gautier says\r\nwith just pride, \"will make its mark on the future and be spoken of as\r\none of the climacteric epochs of the human mind.\" The revolution of July\r\ninspired Delacroix with one of his most interesting pictures. _Le 28\r\nJuillet_ is the only one of his works in which he depicts modern life,\r\nand was a striking refutation to those who complained that modern\r\ncostume is too ugly or prosaic to be treated in painting. \"Every old\r\nmaster,\" Baudelaire usefully pointed out, \"has been modern in his day.\r\nThe greater number of fine portraits of former times are dressed in the\r\ncostume of their period. They are perfectly harmonious because the\r\ncostumes, the hair, and even the attitude and expression (each period\r\nhas its own), form a whole of complete vitality.\" _Le 28 Juillet_ gives\r\nus the very breath and spirit of modern street fighting. Though the\r\npublic\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PLATE XLVI.--JOHN CONSTABLE\r\n\r\nTHE HAY WAIN\r\n\r\n_National Gallery, London_]\r\n\r\nremained hostile and the jury bestowed none of its prizes, as before,\r\nthe Government acknowledged the artist's talent and politics by making\r\nhim a Chevalier of the Legion of Honour. Further, from 1833 to 1853 he\r\nwas intermittently employed in decorating the Chamber of Deputies, the\r\nSenate, and other public buildings. In 1855 he showed at the Great\r\nExhibition a series of thirty-five of his most important pictures, the\r\neffect of which was immense. For the first and only time in his life he\r\nenjoyed a triumph, none the less great because his life-long rival\r\nIngres also took the opportunity of exhibiting a selection of his works\r\nin the same building. But in spite of this success, and in spite of his\r\nbeing elected an Academician in 1857, the critics remained incorrigible.\r\nHis pictures in the Salon of 1859 once more called forth one of those\r\nstorms of abuse that Delacroix had the gift of arousing. Weary and\r\ndisheartened--\"All my life long I have been livré aux bêtes,\" was his\r\nbitter exclamation--he vowed to exhibit no more, and kept his word.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIII\r\n\r\nRUSKIN AGAINST THE PHILISTINES\r\n\r\n\r\nIN England, meantime, great things were being accomplished amid peaceful\r\nsurroundings. In portraiture Lawrence soon became supreme, and what\r\nexcellence he possessed was accentuated on his death in 1830 by the\r\nappointment of Sir Martin Archer Shee as his successor in the Presidency\r\nof the Royal Academy. That was the end of portraiture in England until a\r\nnew school arose. But it was in landscape that our country occupied the\r\nfield in the first half of the nineteenth century, and tilled it with\r\nthe astonishing results that are usually the effect of doing much and\r\nsaying little. The work accomplished by Turner, Constable, and Cotman,\r\nin the first half of the century, to say nothing of Crome and one or two\r\nof the older men who were still alive, has never been equalled in any\r\ncountry, and yet less was heard about the execution of it than would\r\nkeep a modern journalist in bread and cheese for a week. Turner, who\r\nwouldn't sell his pictures, and Constable, who couldn't, between them\r\nfilled up the measure of English art without any other aid than that of\r\nthe materials with which they recorded their gorgeous communion with\r\nnature. When Ruskin stepped in with the \"Modern Painters,\" originally\r\ndesigned as a vindication of Turner against certain later-day critics,\r\nTurner's comment was, \"He knows a great deal more about my pictures than\r\nI do. He puts things into my head and points out meanings in them that I\r\nnever intended.\" That was in 1843, when Turner was well on in his third\r\nmanner--within eight years of his death. But let us go back to the\r\nbeginning.\r\n\r\nUntil he developed his latest manner, Turner was about the most popular\r\nartist that ever lived. His pictures were not above the comprehension of\r\nthe public, educated or otherwise, and no effort was either needed or\r\ndemanded to understand them. In the diary of a provincial amateur,\r\nThomas Greene, are recorded an impression of Turner's work as early as\r\n1797:--\"Visited the Royal Exhibition. Particularly struck with a\r\nsea-view by Turner ...the whole composition bold in design and masterly\r\nin execution. I am entirely unacquainted with the artist, but if he\r\nproceeds as he has begun, he cannot fail to become the first in his\r\ndepartment.\" And again in 1799:--\"Was again struck and delighted with\r\nTurner's landscapes.... Turner's views are not mere ordinary transcripts\r\nof nature,--he always throws some peculiar and striking _character_ into\r\nthe scene he represents.\"\r\n\r\nBrought up as a topographical draughtsman, he made no departure till\r\nquite late in life from the conventional method of depicting scenery;\r\nbut being a supremely gifted artist, he was capable of utilising this\r\nmethod as no other before or since has ever succeeded in doing. The\r\naccepted method was good enough for him, and he laid his paint upon the\r\ncanvas as anybody else had done before him, and as many of our\r\npresent-day painters would do well to do after him--if only they had the\r\ngenius in them to \"make the instrument speak.\" The impressions created\r\non our mind by Turner's earlier pictures are not conveyed by dots,\r\ncubes, streaks, or any device save that of pigment laid upon the canvas\r\nin such a manner as seemed to the artist to reproduce what he saw in\r\nnature. That he did this with surprising and altogether exceptional\r\nskill is the proof of his genius. Unflagging energy and devotion to his\r\nart enabled him to realise, not all, but a wonderful number of the\r\nbeauties he saw in the world, with an experience that few beside him\r\nhave ever taken the trouble to acquire. When barely thirty years old--in\r\n1805--he was already considered as the first of living landscape\r\npainters, and was thus noticed by Edward Dayes (the teacher of\r\nGirtin):--\"Turner may be considered as a striking instance of how much\r\nmay be gained by industry, if accompanied with perseverance, even\r\nwithout the assistance of a master. The way he acquired his professional\r\npowers was by borrowing when he could a drawing or picture to copy; or\r\nby making a sketch of any one in the exhibition early in the morning and\r\nfinishing it up at home. By such practice, and a patient perseverance,\r\nhe has overcome all the difficulties of the art.\" Turner himself used to\r\nsay that his best academy was \"the fields and Dr Monro's parlour\"--where\r\nGirtin and other young artists met and sketched and copied the drawings\r\nin the doctor's collection. Burnet, in his notice of \"Turner and his\r\nWorks,\" suggests that John Robert Cozens had paved the way for both\r\nGirtin and Turner in striking out a broad effect of light and shade.\r\n\"The early pictures of Turner,\" he observes, \"possess the breadth, but\r\nare destitute of the brilliant power of light and colour afterwards\r\npervading his works, and ultimately carried to the greatest extreme in\r\nhis last pictures. Breadth of light seems to have been latterly his\r\nchief aim, supported by the contrast of hot and cold colour; two of his\r\nunfinished pictures exemplified the principle; they were divided into\r\nlarge masses of blue where the water or sky was to come and the other\r\nportions laid out in broad orange yellow, falling into delicate brown\r\nwhere the trees and landscapes were to be placed. This preparation,\r\nwhile it secured the greatest breadth, would have shone through the\r\nother colours when finished, giving the luminous quality observable in\r\nhis pictures. In many instances his works sent for exhibition to the\r\nBritish Institution had little more than this brilliant foundation,\r\nwhich was worked into detail and completed in the varnishing days,\r\nTurner being the first in the morning and the last to leave; his\r\ncertainty in the command over his colour, and the dexterity in his\r\nhandling, seemed to convert in a few hours 'an unsubstantial pageant'\r\ninto a finished landscape. These _ad captandum_ effects, however, are\r\nnot what his fame will depend on for perpetuity; his finest pictures are\r\nthe production of great study in their composition, careful and repeated\r\npainting in the detail, and\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PLATE XLVII.--J. M. W. TURNER\r\n\r\nCROSSING THE BROOK\r\n\r\n_National Gallery of British Art, London_]\r\n\r\na natural arrangement of the colour and breadth of the chiaroscuro.\"\r\n\r\nWhether or not we agree with all of Burnet's opinions, we shall be more\r\nlikely to learn the truth about Turner from prosaic contemporaries of\r\nhis earlier years than from all the rhapsodies of later days. How\r\nsignificant, when stripped of its amusing circumstances, is the simple\r\nfact related thus by Leslie:--\"In 1839, when Constable exhibited his\r\n_Opening of Waterloo Bridge_, it was placed in one of the small rooms\r\nnext to a sea-piece by Turner--a grey picture, beautiful and true, but\r\nwith no positive colour in any part of it. Constable's picture seemed as\r\nif painted with liquid gold and silver, and Turner came several times\r\nwhile he was heightening with vermilion and lake the decorations and\r\nflags of the city barges. Turner stood behind him looking from the\r\n_Waterloo Bridge_ to his own picture, and at last brought his palette\r\nfrom the great room where he was touching another picture, and putting a\r\nround daub of red lead, somewhat bigger than a shilling, on his grey\r\nsea, went away without saying a word. The intensity of this red lead,\r\nmade more vivid by the coolness of his picture, caused even the\r\nvermilion and lake of Constable to look weak. I came into the room just\r\nafter Turner had left it. \"He has been here,\" said Constable, \"and fired\r\na gun.\" On the opposite wall was a picture by Jones of Shadrach Meshach\r\nand Abednego in the Furnace. \"A coal,\" said Cooper, \"has bounced across\r\nthe room from Jones's picture and set fire to Turner's sea.\" Turner did\r\nnot come in again for a day and a half, and then in the last moment\r\nallowed for painting, he glazed the scarlet seal he had put on his\r\npicture, and shaped it into a buoy.\"\r\n\r\nIt was in 1835, after an unbroken popular triumph lasting over thirty\r\nyears, that the critics openly rounded on him. The occasion seized by\r\n_Blackwood's Magazine_ was the exhibition of his first Venetian picture\r\nexhibited in that year--it is now in the Metropolitan Museum in New\r\nYork. \"What is Venice in this picture?\" wrote Blackwood's critic. \"A\r\nflimsy, whitewashed, meagre assemblage of architecture, starting off\r\nghost-like into unnatural perspective, as if frightened at the affected\r\nblaze of some dogger vessels (the only attempt at richness in the\r\npicture). The greater part of the picture is white, disagreeable white,\r\nwithout light or transparency, and the boats with their red worsted\r\nmasts are as gewgaw as a child's toy which he may have cracked to see\r\nwhat it is made of. As to Venice, nothing can be more unlike its\r\ncharacter.\"\r\n\r\nRuskin was then only sixteen years old, but eight years later appeared\r\nin print the first volume of \"Modern Painters,\" \"by an undergraduate of\r\nOxford,\" as the result of his growing indignation at this and subsequent\r\nattacks on Turner. Without following Ruskin into the dubious regions\r\nwhither the pursuit of his romantic fancies ultimately led him, we may\r\nin fairness quote the opening sentence of his second chapter, \"Of Truth\r\nof Colour,\" which will help us, moreover, in understanding the\r\nconditions under which painting was being conducted at this period.\r\n\"There is nothing so high in art,\" he says, \"but that a scurrile jest\r\ncan reach at, and often the greater the work the easier it is to turn it\r\ninto ridicule. To appreciate the science of Turner's colour would\r\nrequire the study of a life; but to laugh at it requires little more\r\nthan the knowledge that the yolk of egg is yellow and spinage green; a\r\nfund of critical information on which the remarks of most of our\r\nleading periodicals have been of late years exclusively based. We\r\nshall, however, in spite of the sulphur and treacle criticisms of our\r\nScotch connoisseurs, and the eggs and spinage of our English ones,\r\nendeavour to test the works of this great colourist by a knowledge of\r\nnature somewhat more extensive than is to be gained by an acquaintance,\r\nhowever formed, with the apothecary's shop or the dinner table.\"\r\n\r\nSo much for the critics. For the artist, if Ruskin said more than Turner\r\nhimself could understand, he has summed up his achievement in a few\r\npassages which may possibly outlast the works themselves. \"There has\r\nbeen marked and constant progress in his mind; he has not, like some few\r\nartists, been without childhood; his course of study has been as\r\nevidently as it has been swiftly progressive; and in different stages of\r\nthe struggle, sometimes one order of truth, sometimes another, has been\r\naimed at or omitted. But from the beginning to the present height of his\r\ncareer he has never sacrificed a greater truth to a less. As he\r\nadvanced, the previous knowledge or attainment was absorbed in what\r\nsucceeded, or abandoned only if incompatible, and never abandoned\r\nwithout a gain: and his present works present the sum and perfection of\r\nhis accumulated knowledge, delivered with the impatience and passion of\r\none who feels too much, and has too little time to say it in, to pause\r\nfor expression or ponder over his syllables.\" And again of his latest\r\nworks--\"There is in them the obscurity, but the truth, of prophecy; the\r\ninstinctive and burning language, which would express less if it uttered\r\nmore; which is indistinct only by its fulness, and dark with its\r\nabundant meaning. He feels now, with long-trained vividness and keenness\r\nof sense, too bitterly, the impotence of the hand and the vainness of\r\nthe colour to catch one shadow or one image of the glory which God has\r\nrevealed to him. He has dwelt and communed with Nature all the days of\r\nhis life: he knows her now too well, he cannot falter over the material\r\nlittlenesses of her outward form: he must give her soul, or he has done\r\nnothing, and he cannot do this with the flax, the earth, and the oil. 'I\r\ncannot gather the beams out of the east, or I would make _them_ tell you\r\nwhat I have seen; but read this, and interpret this, and let us remember\r\ntogether. I cannot gather the gloom out of the night sky, or I would\r\nmake that teach you what I have seen; but read this, interpret this, and\r\nlet us feel together. And if you have not that within you which I can\r\nsummon to my aid, if you have not the sun in your spirit, and the\r\npassion in your heart, which my words may awaken, though they be\r\nindistinct and swift, leave me; for I will give you no patient mockery,\r\nno laborious insult of that glorious Nature, whose I am and whom I\r\nserve. Let other servants imitate the voice and the gesture of their\r\nmaster, while they forget his message. Hear that message from me; but\r\nremember that the teaching of Divine truth must still be a mystery.'\"\r\n\r\nWithin a very few years Ruskin was performing a more useful service for\r\nthe English School of painting than that of gilding the fine gold of its\r\ngreatest genius. Whether or not he was aware of the fact, young Holman\r\nHunt had borrowed a copy of \"Modern Painters,\" which, he says, entirely\r\nchanged his opinions as to the views held by society at large concerning\r\nart, and in 1849 there were exhibited Hunt's _Rienzi_, Rossetti's\r\n_Girlhood of Mary Virgin_, and Millais' _Lorenzo and Isabella_, each\r\ninscribed with the mystic letters \"P.R.B.,\" meaning \"Pre-Raphaelite\r\nBrotherhood.\" It is interesting to note that this alliance was formed\r\nwhen the three young artists were looking over a book of engravings of\r\nthe frescoes in the Campo Santo at Pisa.\r\n\r\nIn the following year Hunt exhibited the _British Family_, Millais, _The\r\nCarpenter's Shop_, and Rossetti the _Ecce Ancilla Domini_, and in 1851\r\nwere Hunt's _Two Gentlemen of Verona_ and three by Millais. The fury of\r\nthe critics had now reached a point at which some notice had to be taken\r\nof it--as of a man in an apopleptic fit. That of the Times in\r\nparticular:--\"These young artists have unfortunately become notorious by\r\naddicting themselves to an antiquated style, false perspective, and\r\ncrude colour of remote antiquity. We want not to see what Fuseli termed\r\ndrapery \"snapped instead of folded,\" faces bloated into apoplexy, or\r\nextenuated into skeletons; colour borrowed from the jars in a druggist's\r\nshop, and expression forced into caricature. That morbid infatuation\r\nwhich sacrifices truth, beauty, and genuine feeling to mere eccentricity\r\ndeserves no quarter at the hands of the public.\" It was in disapproval\r\nof the tone of this outburst that the author of \"Modern Painters\"\r\naddressed his famous and useful letter to the _Times_, vindicating the\r\nartists, and following it up with another in which he wishes them all\r\n\"heartily good speed, believing in sincerity that if they temper the\r\ncourage and energy which they have shown in the adoption of their\r\nsystems with patience and discretion in framing it, and if they do not\r\nsuffer themselves to be driven by harsh and careless criticism into\r\nrejection of the ordinary means of obtaining influence over the minds of\r\nothers, they may, as they gain experience, lay in our England the\r\nfoundation of a school of art nobler than the world has seen for three\r\nhundred years.\"\r\n\r\nIf any one of this strenuous young band had been a painter of the first\r\nrank, this prediction might have been abundantly verified. But it must\r\nbe owned that none of them was. Holman Hunt came nearest to being, and\r\nMillais probably thought he was, when he had abandoned his early\r\nprinciples and shaped for the Presidency of the Academy. Rossetti had\r\nmore genius in him than the others, but it came out in poetry as well as\r\nin painting, and perhaps in more lasting form. As it was, the effects of\r\nthe revolution were widespread and entirely beneficial; but those\r\neffects must not be looked for in the works of any one particular\r\nartist, but rather in the general aspect of English art in the\r\nsucceeding half century, and perhaps to-day. It broke up the soil. The\r\nflowers that came up were neither rare nor great, but they were many,\r\nvaried, and pleasing, and in every respect an improvement on the\r\nevergreens and hardy annuals with which the English garden had become\r\nmore and more encumbered from want of intelligent cultivation. More than\r\nthis, the freedom engendered of revolt had now encouraged the young\r\nartist to feel that he was no longer bound to paint in any particular\r\nfashion. People's eyes were opened to possibilities as well as to\r\nactualities; and though they were prone to close again under the\r\nsoporific influence of what was regular and conventional, they were\r\ncapable of opening again, perhaps with a start, but without the\r\nnecessity for a surgical operation. In 1847, for example, George\r\nFrederick Watts had offered to adorn, free of charge, the booking-hall\r\nof Euston Station, and had been refused--Watts, by the by, was quite\r\nindependent of the Pre-Raphaelites--whereas in 1860 the Benchers of\r\nLincoln's Inn accepted his _School of Legislature_, and in 1867 he was\r\nelected an academician.\r\n\r\nTwo somewhat remarkable effects of the movement are attributed to it by\r\nMr Edmund Gosse (in a note on the work of Alfred Hunt, written in\r\n1884), which are probably typical of many more. The Liverpool Academy,\r\nfounded in 1810, had an annual grant of £200 from the Corporation. In\r\n1857 it gave a prize to Millais' _Blind Girl_ in preference to the most\r\npopular picture of the year (Abraham Solomon's _Waiting for the\r\nVerdict_), and so great was the public indignation that pressure was\r\nbrought to bear on the Corporation, the grant was withdrawn, and the\r\nAcademy ruined.\r\n\r\nIn the other instance we may not go the whole way with Mr Gosse, when in\r\nspeaking of the Pre-Raphaelite principle he says that \"the school of\r\nTurnerian landscape was fatally affected by them,\" or that all the\r\nlandscape painters, except Alfred Hunt, \"accepted the veto which the\r\nPre-Raphaelites had tacitly laid upon composition or a striving after an\r\nartificial harmony of forms in landscape.\" But to a certain extent their\r\ninfluence undoubtedly was prejudicial in that respect. In suggesting\r\nanother reason for the cessation of Turner s influence he is quite as\r\nnear the mark, namely, the action of the Royal Academy in admitting no\r\nlandscape painters to membership. At Turner's death in 1851 there were\r\nonly three, among whom was Creswick. \"This popular artist,\" says Mr\r\nGosse, \"was the Upas tree under whose shadow the Academical patronage of\r\nlandscape died in England. From his election as an associate in 1842 to\r\nthat of Vicat Cole in 1869, no landscape painter entered the doors of\r\nthe Royal Academy.\" Of this august body we shall have something to say\r\nlater on.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIV\r\n\r\nMANET AND WHISTLER AGAINST THE WORLD\r\n\r\n\r\nLet us now cross the channel again, and see what is going on there, in\r\n1863. Evidently there is something on, or there would not be so much\r\nexcitement. As we approach the Capital we are aware of one name being\r\nprominent in the general uproar--that of ÉDOUARD MANET.\r\n\r\nManet's revolt against tradition began before he became an artist, as\r\nwas in fact necessary, or he would never have been allowed to become\r\none. The traditions of the Bourgoisie were sacred, and their power and\r\nimportance since the revolution of 1848 not to be lightly set aside. But\r\nyoung Manet was so determined that he was at last allowed by his\r\nbourgeois parents to have his way, and was sent to study under that very\r\nrough diamond Couture. Now again his \"revolting\" qualities showed\r\nthemselves, this time in the life class. Théodore Duret, his friend and\r\nbiographer, puts it so amusingly that a quotation, untranslated, is\r\nimperative:--\"Cette repulsion qui se développe chez Manet pour l'art de\r\nla tradition,\" he says, \"se manifeste surtout par le mépris qu'il\r\ntémoigne aux modèles posant dans l'atelier et à l'étude du nu telle\r\nqu'elle était alors conduite. Le culte de l'antique comme on le\r\ncomprenait dans la première moitié du XIXe siècle parmi les peintres\r\navait amené la recherche de modèles speciaux. On leur demandait des\r\nformes pleines. Les hommes en particulier devaient avoir une poitrine\r\nlarge et bombée, un torse puissant, des membres musclés. Les individus\r\ndoués des qualités requises qui posaient alors dans les ateliers,\r\ns'etaient habitués à prendre des attitudes prétendues expressive et\r\nheroïques, mais toujours tendues et conventionelles, d'où l'imprévu\r\nétait banni. Manet, porté vers le naturel et épris de recherches,\r\ns'irritait de ces poses d'un type fixe et toujours les mêmes. Aussi\r\nfaisait-il tres mauvais ménage avec les modèles. Il cherchait à en\r\nobtenir des poses contraires à leurs habitudes, auxquelles ils se\r\nrefusaient. Les modèles connus qui avaient vu les morceaux faits d'après\r\nleurs torses conduire certains élèves à l'école de Rome, alors la\r\nsuprême récompense, et qui dans leur orgueil s'attribuaient presqu'une\r\npart du succès, se revoltaient de voir un tout jeune homme ne leur\r\ntémoigner aucun respect. Il paraît que fatigué de l'eternelle étude du\r\nnu, Manet aurait essayé de draper et même d'habiller les modèles, ce qui\r\naurait causé parmi eux une véritable indignation.\"\r\n\r\nIt was in 1863 that the storm of popular fury burst over Manet's head,\r\non the exhibition of his first important picture, painted three years\r\nbefore, generally known as _Le Déjeuner sur l'herbe_. This wonderful\r\ncanvas was something so new and so surprising that it was rejected by\r\nthe jury of the Salon. But in company with less conspicuous though\r\nequally unacceptable pieces by such men as Bracquemond, Cazin,\r\nFantin-Latour, Harpignies, Jongkind, J. P. Laurens, Le Gros, Pissarro,\r\nVollon, and Whistler, it was accorded an exhibition, alongside the\r\nofficial Salon, which was called _le Salon des refusés_. Being the\r\nlargest and most conspicuous work shown, it attracted no less attention\r\nthan if it had been officially hung, and probably much more. \"Ainsi ce\r\nDéjeuner sur l'herbe,\" says M. Duret, \"venait-il faire comme une énorme\r\ntache. Il donnait la sensation de quelquechose outré. Il heurtait la\r\nvision. Il produisait, sur les yeux du public de ce temps, l'effet de la\r\npleine lumière sur les yeux du hibou.\"\r\n\r\nThere was more than one reason for this remarkable picture surprising\r\nand shocking the sensibilities of the public. It represents a couple of\r\nmen in everyday bourgeois costume, one sitting and the other reclining\r\non the grass under trees, while next to one of them is seated a young\r\nwoman, her head turned to the spectator, in no costume at all. A\r\nprofusion of _articles de déjeuner_ is beside her, and it is evident\r\nthat they are only waiting to arrange the meal till a second young\r\nwoman, who is seen bathing in the near background, is ready to join\r\nthem. The subject and composition are reminiscent of Giorgione's\r\nbeautiful and famous _Fête Champêtre_, in the Louvre, and Manet quite\r\nfrankly and in quite good faith pleaded Giorgione as his precedent when\r\nassailed on grounds of good taste. But unfortunately he had not put his\r\nmale figures in \"fancy dress,\" and the public could hardly be expected\r\nto realise that Giorgione had not, either. As for the painting, it was a\r\nrevelation. He had broken every canon of tradition--and yet it was a\r\nmarvellous success!\r\n\r\nAnother outburst greeted the appearance of the wonderful _Olympia_ in\r\n1865, this time in the official catalogue. This is now enshrined in the\r\nLouvre. It was painted in 1863, but fortunately, perhaps, Manet had not\r\nthe courage to exhibit it then--for who can tell to what length the fury\r\nof the Philistines might not have been goaded by two such shocks? As it\r\nwas, this second violation of the sacred traditions of the nude, which\r\nhad been exclusively reserved for allegorical subjects, was considered\r\nan outrage; and the innocent, natural model, of by no means voluptuous\r\nappearance, was regarded as a disgraceful intrusion into the chaste\r\ncategory of nymphs and goddesses. As a painter, however, Manet had shown\r\nhimself unmistakably as the great figure of\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PLATE XLVIII.--ÉDOUARD MANET\r\n\r\nOLYMPIA\r\n\r\n_Louvre, Paris_]\r\n\r\nthe age, and if we have to go to Paris or to New York to catch a glimpse\r\nof any of his work, it is partly because we are too backward in seizing\r\nopportunities so eagerly snapped up by others.\r\n\r\nThe next great storm in the artistic world followed in the wake of one\r\nof Manet's companions in adversity at the _Salon des Refusés_--JAMES\r\nM'NEILL WHISTLER, who left Paris and settled with his mother in Chelsea\r\nin the late 'sixties. That he should have existed for fifteen whole\r\nyears without breaking forth into strife is so extraordinary that we are\r\nalmost tempted to attribute it to the influence of his mother, who used\r\nto bring him to the old church on Sundays, as the present writer dimly\r\nremembers. In this case it was not the public, but the critic, John\r\nRuskin, who so deftly dropped the fat into the fire. Having, as we saw,\r\ntaken up the cudgels for poor Turner against the public in 1843, and for\r\nthe Pre-Raphaelite Brotherhood in 1850, he now, in 1877, ranged himself\r\non the other side, and accused Whistler of impertinence in \"flinging a\r\npot of paint in the face of the public.\" The action for libel which\r\nWhistler commenced in the following year resulted in strict fact in a\r\nverdict of one farthing damages for the libelled one; but in reality the\r\nresults were much farther reaching. The artist had vindicated not only\r\nhimself, but his art, from the attacks of the ignorant and bumptious.\r\n\"Poor art!\" Whistler wrote, \"What a sad state the slut is in, an these\r\ngentlemen shall help her. The artist alone, by the way, is to no purpose\r\nand remains unconsulted; his work is explained and rectified without\r\nhim, by the one who was never in it--but upon whom God, always good\r\nthough sometimes careless, has thrown away the knowledge refused to the\r\nauthor, poor devil!\" This recalls Turner's comment on Ruskin's\r\neulogies--which Whistler had probably never heard of--and making every\r\nallowance for Whistler's fiery, combative nature, and sharp pen, there\r\nis much truth, and truth that needed telling, in his contention. \"Art,\"\r\nhe continues, \"that for ages has hewn its own history in marble, and\r\nwritten its own comments on canvas, shall it suddenly stand still, and\r\nstammer, and wait for wisdom from the passer-by? For guidance from the\r\nhand that holds neither brush nor chisel? Out upon the shallow conceit!\"\r\n\r\nOf the hopeless banality of the critics during this period there are\r\nplenty of examples to be found without looking very far. Several of the\r\nmost amusing have been embodied in a little volume of \"Whistler\r\nStories,\" lately compiled by Mr Don C. Seitz of New York. Here we find\r\n_The Standard's_ little joke about Whistler paying his costs in the\r\naction--apart from those allowed on taxation, that is to say--\"But he\r\nhas only to paint, or, as we believe he expresses it 'knock off' three\r\nor four 'symphonies' or 'harmonies'--or perhaps he might try his hand at\r\na Set of Quadrilles in Peacock Blue?--and a week's labour will set all\r\nsquare.\" Then there is this priceless revelation of his art when\r\nquestioning his class in Paris. \"Do you know what I mean when I say\r\ntone, value, light, shade, quality, movement, construction, etc.?\"\r\n_Chorus_, \"Oh, yes, Mr Whistler!\" \"I'm glad, for it's more than I do\r\nmyself.\" More serious was the verdict of Sir George Scharf, keeper of\r\nthe National Gallery, when (in 1874) there was a proposal to purchase\r\nthe portrait of Carlyle. \"Well,\" he said, icily, on looking at the\r\npicture, \"and has painting come to this!\"\r\n\r\nHigh place, it would seem, did not always conduce to an appreciation of\r\nhigh art. Here is the opinion of Sir Charles Eastlake, F.R.I.B.A., also\r\nkeeper of the\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PLATE XLIX.--J. M. WHISTLER\r\n\r\nLILLIE IN OUR ALLEY\r\n\r\n_In the possession of John J. Cowan, Esq._]\r\n\r\nNational Gallery, published in 1883, on one of Rembrandt's pictures in\r\nthe Louvre:--\r\n\r\n\"_The Bath_, a very ugly and offensive picture, in which the principal\r\nobject is the ill-proportioned figure of a naked woman, distinguished by\r\nflesh tones whose colour suggests the need of a bath rather than the\r\nfact that it has been taken. The position of the old servant wiping the\r\nwoman's feet is not very intelligible, and the drawing of the bather's\r\nlegs is distinctly defective. The light and shade of the picture, though\r\nobviously untrue to natural effect, are managed with the painter's usual\r\ndexterity.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nV\r\n\r\nTHE ROYAL ACADEMY\r\n\r\n\r\nThe last revolt of the nineteenth century was effected in a peaceable\r\nand business-like, but none the less successful manner, by the\r\nestablishment, in 1886, of the New English Art Club as a means of\r\ndefence against the mighty _vis inertiæ_ of the Royal Academy. As an\r\nexample of the disadvantage under which any artist laboured who did not\r\nbow down to the great Idol, I venture to quote a few sentences from the\r\nreport of the Select Committee of the House of Lords appointed to\r\ninquire into the administration of the Chantrey Trust, in 1904:----\r\n\r\n\"With five exceptions, all the works in the collection have been bought\r\nfrom summer exhibitions of the Royal Academy.\"\r\n\r\n\"It is admitted by those most friendly to the present system that the\r\nChantrey collection regarded as a national gallery of modern British art\r\nis incomplete, and in a large degree unrepresentative. The works of\r\nmany of the most brilliant and capable artists who worked in the last\r\nquarter of the nineteenth century are missing from the gallery, and the\r\nendeavour to account for these omissions has formed one main branch of\r\nthe inquiry.\"\r\n\r\n\"It has been stated that while containing some fine works of art, it is\r\nlacking in variety and interest, and while failing to give expression to\r\nmuch of the finest artistic feeling of its period, it includes not a few\r\nworks of minor importance. Full consideration of the evidence has led\r\nthe Committee to regard this view as approximately correct.\"\r\n\r\nUp to 1897, when the collection was handed over to the nation, little\r\nshort of £50,000 had been spent upon it. And with five exceptions,\r\namounting to less than £5000, the whole of that money had been expended\r\non such works alone as were permitted by the Academy to be exhibited on\r\ntheir walls.\r\n\r\nOf the £5000, it may be noted, £2200 was well laid out on Watts's\r\n_Psyche_; but with regard to the very first purchase made, in 1877, for\r\n£1000,--Hilton's _Christ Mocked_, which had been painted as an\r\naltar-piece for S. Peter's, Eaton Square, in 1839, the following\r\nquestion and answer are full of bitter significance for the poor artist\r\nof the time:----\r\n\r\n     Lord Ribblesdale.--Was Mr Hilton's picture offered by the Vicar and\r\n     Churchwardens?\r\n\r\n     The Secretary to the Royal Academy.--Yes, it was offered by\r\n     them--one of the Churchwardens was the late Lord Maghermorne--he\r\n     was then Sir James M'Garrell Hogg--he was a great friend of Sir\r\n     Francis Grant who was the President, and he offered it to him for\r\n     the Chantrey Collection.\r\n\r\nWhen repeatedly pressed by the Committee for the reasons why so few\r\npurchases were made outside the Academy exhibitions, the President, Sir\r\nEdward Poynter, repeatedly pleaded the impossibility of a Council of\r\nTen, all of whom must see pictures before they are bought, travelling\r\nabout in search of them. In view of this apparent--but obviously\r\nunreal--difficulty, the following questions were then put by the Earl of\r\nLytton:----\r\n\r\n420. Without actually changing the terms of the will, has the question\r\nof employing an agent for the purpose of finding out what pictures were\r\navailable and giving advice upon them ever been suggested?--No.\r\n\r\n421. That would come within the term of the will, would it not, the\r\nfinal voting being, as it is now, in the hands of the Academy; it would\r\nbe open to the Council to appoint an agent, as was suggested just now,\r\nof going to Scotland, and going about the country making suggestions as\r\nto pictures which in his opinion might be bought?--The question has\r\nnever arisen.\r\n\r\n422. But that could be done, could it not?--I suppose that could be done\r\nunder the terms of the will, but I do not suppose that the Academy would\r\never do it.\r\n\r\nAs a comment on this let us turn to the \"Autobiography of W. P. Frith R.\r\nA.\" (Chapter xl.):--\"A portion of the year ... was spent in the service\r\nof the winter Exhibition of Old Masters. My duties took me into strange\r\nplaces.... One of my first visits was paid to a huge mansion in the\r\nNorth.... I visited thirty-eight different collections of old masters\r\nand named for selection over three hundred pictures.... The pictures of\r\nReynolds are so much desired for the winter Exhibition that neither\r\ntrouble nor expense are spared in searching for them; so hearing of one\r\ndescribed to me as of unusual splendour, I made a journey into Wales\r\nwith the solitary Reynolds for its object.\"\r\n\r\nHere, where it is not a question of a Trust for the benefit of the\r\npublic and for the encouragement of artists, there appears to have been\r\nno trouble or expense spared. But the real reason for the Academic\r\nselection leapt naïvely from the mouth of the President a little later,\r\nin reply to question 545.--\"The best artists come into the Academy\r\nultimately. I do not say that there have been no exceptions, but as a\r\ngeneral rule all the best artists ultimately become Academicians. It is\r\nnatural, if we want the best pictures that we should go to the best\r\nartists.\"\r\n\r\nOn this point the answer to a question put by Lord Lytton to one of the\r\nforty, Sir William Richmond, K.C.B., is of value, as showing that the\r\ngrievances of \"the outsiders\" were not imaginary:--\r\n\r\n767. I just want to ask you one more question. When you said that in\r\nyour opinion the walls of the Academy have had priority of claim in the\r\npast, have you any particular reason for that statement?--Yes. I may\r\nmention this to show that I am consistent. Before I was an Associate of\r\nthe Royal Academy, I fought hard for what are called, in rather\r\nundignified language, the outsiders, and I was anxious that men should\r\nbe elected Associates of the Royal Academy not necessarily because they\r\nexhibit on the Royal Academy walls, but because they are competent\r\npainters. That was my fight upon which I stood; and I refused to send a\r\npicture to the Royal Academy on the understanding that if I did I should\r\nprobably be elected Associate that year, and also that my picture would\r\nbe bought by the Chantrey Fund. My answer to that was, \"If my picture is\r\ngood enough to be purchased for the Chantrey Bequest my picture can be\r\npurchased from the walls of the Grosvenor Gallery as well as from the\r\nwalls of the Royal Academy. That seems to me to be justice.\"\r\n\r\nThe \"New English,\" then, had some justification for their establishment;\r\nand although they did not make very much headway before the close of the\r\nnineteenth century, they find themselves at the opening of the twentieth\r\nin a position to determine to a very considerable extent what the future\r\nof English painting is to be, just as the Academy succeeded in\r\ndetermining it before they came into existence.\r\n\r\nFor the Academy everything that was vital in English art in the last\r\nhalf century had no existence--was simply ignored. For the New English,\r\nit was the seed that flowered, under their gentle influence, into the\r\nmany varieties of blossoms with which our garden is already filled. To\r\nthe Academy there was no such thing as change or development--their ears\r\nwere deaf to any innovation, their eyes were blind to any fresh beauty.\r\nTo others, every new movement foretold its significance, and the century\r\nclosed with the recognition of the fact that art must live and develop\r\nif it is to be anything but a comfortable means of subsistence for a\r\nself-constituted authority of forty and their friends.\r\n\r\nLet me be allowed to conclude this chapter, and my imperfect efforts to\r\nindicate the energies of six centuries of art in so small a space, with\r\na passage from a lecture delivered in 1882 by Mr Selwyn Image, now Slade\r\nProfessor at Oxford, which embodies the spirit in the air at that time,\r\nand foreshadows what was to come. \"I do not feel that we have come here\r\nto sing a requiem for art this afternoon,\" he said. \"As a giant it will\r\nrenew its strength and rejoice to run its course. I am not a prophet, I\r\ncannot tell you just what that course is going to be. Nor is it possible\r\nto estimate what is around us with the same security, with the same\r\nvalue, that we estimate what has passed--you must be at a certain\r\ndistance to take things in. But in contemporary art we can notice some\r\ncharacteristics, which are quite at one with what we call the modern\r\nspirit; and extremely suggestive--for they seem to indicate movement,\r\nand therefore life, in this imaginative sphere, just as there is\r\nmovement and life in the sphere of science or of social interests. For\r\ninstance, in modern representative work ... I think anyone comparing it\r\nas a whole with the work of the old masters, will be struck as against\r\ntheir distinctness, containedness, simplicity and serenity; with its\r\ncomplexity, restlessness, and vagueness, and emotion, and suggestiveness\r\nin place of delineation, and impressionism in place of literal\r\ntranscription--and this alike in execution and motive. I do not mean to\r\nsay that these qualities are better than the qualities that preceded\r\nthem, or worse--but only that they are different, only that they are of\r\nthe modern spirit--only that they indicate movement and life; and so far\r\nthat is hopeful--is it not?\"\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE END\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_INDEX_\r\n\r\n\r\nAcademy of Painting, the French, 231\r\n\r\n---- the Royal, 279, 286,
