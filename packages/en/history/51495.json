M:\r\n\r\n_My dears_,\r\n\r\nThese letters were all written for you; scratched down on odds and ends\r\nof writing paper, in a rare spare moment at the canteen; at night, at my\r\nbillet, by candle-light; in the mornings, perched in front of Madame’s\r\nfireplace with my toes tucked up on an ornamental _chaufrette_\r\nfoot-warmer. Why were they never sent? Simply because all letters mailed\r\nfrom France in those days, must of course pass under the eyes of the\r\nCensor. And as the Censor was likely to be a young man who sat opposite\r\nyou at the mess-table, it meant that one mustn’t say the things one\r\ncould, and one couldn’t say the things one would. So, after my first\r\nfortnight over there I decided to write my letters to you just as I\r\nwould at home, putting down everything I saw and thought and did, quite\r\nbrazenly and shamelessly, and then keep them,—under lock and key if need\r\nbe,—until I could give them to you in person.\r\n\r\nWritten with the thought of you in my mind, these letters are first of\r\nall for you, and after that for whoever they may concern, being a true\r\nrecord of one girl’s experience with the A. E. F. in France during the\r\nGreat War.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER I: BOURMONT—COMPANY A\r\n\r\n\r\nBourmont, France, Nov. 24, 1917.\r\n\r\nMy village has red roofs. When I first came to France and saw that the\r\nvillages were two kinds; those with red roofs and those with grey, I\r\nprayed _le bon Dieu_ that mine should be a red-roofed one. Heaven was\r\nkind. Every little house in town is covered with rose-colored tiles. We\r\ncame here yesterday from Paris. Our orders, which were delivered to us\r\nin great secrecy, read: Report to Mr. T——, Divisional Secretary,\r\nBourmont, Haute Marne; then followed a schedule of trains. That was all\r\nwe knew except that some one told us that at Bourmont it had rained\r\nsteadily all fall.\r\n\r\n“It cleared off for several hours once,” concluded our informant. “But\r\nthat was in the middle of the night when nobody was awake to see.”\r\n\r\nBourmont is a city set upon a hill, a hill that rises so sharply, so\r\nsuddenly, that no motor vehicle is allowed to take the straight road up\r\nits side, but must follow the roundabout route at the back. Already we\r\nhave heard tales about our hill; one of them being of a lad belonging to\r\na company of engineers stationed here, who in a spendthrift mood, being\r\ndisinclined to climb the hill one night after having dined at the café\r\nat its foot, bribed an old Frenchman with a fifty franc note to wheel\r\nhim to the summit in a wheelbarrow. The Frenchman, for whose powers one\r\nmust have great respect, achieved the feat eventually, the spectators\r\nagreeing the ride a bargain at the price.\r\n\r\nTwo-thirds of the way up the hill on the steep street called grandiosely\r\n_Le Faubourg de France_ we have our billet, at the home of Monsieur and\r\nMadame Chaput. These are an adorable old couple; Madame a stately yet\r\nlovably gentle soul, Monsieur le Commandant, a veteran of the\r\nFranco-Prussian War and member of the _Légion d’Honneur_. His wonderful\r\nold uniforms with their scarlet trousers and gold epaulets rub elbows\r\nwith my whipcord in the wardrobe.\r\n\r\nOutside, the Maison Chaput resembles all the other houses which, built\r\none adjoining another, present a solid grey plaster front on each side\r\nof the street. Like all the rest it has two doors, one opening into the\r\nhouse and one into the stable, and like every other house on the street\r\nthe doors bear little boards with the billeting capacity of house and\r\nstable stenciled on them, so many _Hommes_, so many _Off._ (for\r\n_Officiers_). It is told how one lad after walking the length of the\r\nstreet exclaimed;\r\n\r\n“Gee! Looks as if this were Dippyville. There’s one or two off in every\r\nhouse!”\r\n\r\nAnother boy gazing ruefully at the sign on his billet door, groaned;\r\n\r\n“Twelve homes! Why, there ain’t one there!”\r\n\r\nOne stable door nearby wears the legend in large scrawling letters;\r\n“Sherman was right.” At first the owner was furious at this defacement\r\nof his property, but when someone explained the significance of the\r\nwords to him, he became mollified and even took a pride in them.\r\n\r\n“Where are you stopping?” asks one boy of another.\r\n\r\n“Me? Oh, at the Hotel de Barn, four manure-heaps straight ahead and two\r\nto the right.”\r\n\r\nThe distinguishing feature of the Maison Chaput is the corner-stone.\r\nThis shows as a white stone tablet at one side of the door. On it is\r\ncarved “Laid by the hand of Emil Chaput, aged one year. Anno. 1842.” It\r\nis the same Emil Chaput who with his tiny baby hand “laid” the\r\ncorner-stone who is now our genial host.\r\n\r\n“It is droll,” said Madame; “When strangers come to town they must\r\nalways stop and read the corner-stone. They think the tablet is placed\r\nthere to mark the birthplace of some famous man.”\r\n\r\nThe Gendarme and I,—Madame has christened G—— my companion the Gendarme\r\non account of her vigorous brisk bearing,—live in the _Salle des\r\nAssiettes_, at least that is what I have named it, for the walls of the\r\nroom which evidently in more pretentious days served as a _salle à\r\nmanger_, are literally covered with the most beautiful old plates. Not\r\nbeing a connoisseur I don’t know what their history is nor what might be\r\ntheir value; I only know that they are altogether lovely. The designs\r\nare delicious; flowers, insects, birds, little houses, Chinamen fishing\r\nin tiny boats, interspersed with spirited representations of the Gallic\r\ncock in rose and scarlet. I exclaimed over them to Madame, whereat\r\nMonsieur, candle in hand, bustled across the room and called on me to\r\nregard one in particular.\r\n\r\n“_Ça coute_,” he averred proudly, “_quarante francs!_”\r\n\r\nSince that moment I have been vaguely uneasy. What if, in a moment of\r\nexasperation, I should throw an ink-bottle at the Gendarme’s head,\r\nand—shatter a plate worth forty francs!\r\n\r\nOur room is the third one back. The front room is kitchen, dining and\r\nliving room. The in-between room is quite bare of furniture, lined all\r\nabout with panelled cupboards, and quite without light or air except\r\nthat which filters in through the opened doors. In one of these\r\ncupboards Monsieur le Commandant spends his nights. When the hour for\r\nretiring comes, he opens a little panelled door and climbs into the hole\r\nin the wall thus revealed, leaving the door a crack open after him. When\r\nwe pass through on our way to breakfast we hurry by the cupboard with\r\naverted faces. The family Chaput are not early risers.\r\n\r\nAlready Madame has taken us into her warm heart. She will be our mother\r\nwhile we are in France, she tells us. Everything about us is of\r\nabsorbing interest. When the Gendarme exhibited her wardrobe trunk, she\r\nwas fairly overcome.\r\n\r\n“_Ah, vive l’Amérique_,” she cried, clapping her old hands, and, “_Vive\r\nl’Amérique!_” again.\r\n\r\nBourmont, it seems, is army Divisional Headquarters. It is also\r\nheadquarters for this division of the Y. There is a hut here, a\r\nwarehouse, and headquarters offices, employing a personnel of sixteen or\r\nseventeen. By tomorrow the Gendarme and I will know what our work is to\r\nbe.\r\n\r\n\r\nBourmont, November 28.\r\n\r\nI have a canteen; the Gendarme, who has had some business training, is\r\nto work in the office. My canteen is in Saint Thiebault, the village\r\nnext door. In the morning I go down the hill, past the grey houses built\r\nlike steps on either side—some with odd pear trees, their branches\r\ntrained gridiron-wise flat against the fronts,—over the river Meuse,\r\nhere a sleepy little stream, to Saint Thiebault. On the way I pass lads\r\nin olive drab with whom I exchange a smile and a hello, villagers\r\nbare-headed, in sabots, and poilus in what was once horizon blue. In\r\nParis the uniforms were all so beautiful and bright, but here at\r\nBourmont one sees the real hue, faded, discolored, muddy, worn. The\r\nsoldiers, middle-aged men for the most part, slouch about, occupied with\r\nhomely, simple tasks, chopping wood and drawing water. One feels there\r\nis something painfully improper in the fact that they should be in\r\nuniform; they should, each and every one, be propped comfortably in\r\nfront of their own hearthsides reading _l’Echo de Paris_, in felt\r\nslippers while their wooden shoes rest on the sill outside. And yet\r\nthese very ones, I think as I look at them, may be the defenders of\r\nVerdun, the victors of the Marne, the veterans of a hundred battles!\r\n\r\nThe Bourmontese, who are proud and haughty folk, and call themselves a\r\ncity though they number only a few hundred souls, look with disdain on\r\nthe smaller village of Saint Thiebault, _Saint Thiebault des Crapauds_\r\nthey call it, Saint Thiebault of the Toads. Approaching Saint Thiebault\r\none sees two unmistakable signs of American occupancy; first, a large\r\nheap of empty tin cans and then the Stars and Stripes fluttering from a\r\nflag pole in the centre of the village. For Saint Thiebault is\r\nRegimental Headquarters and it is the boast of the old Colonel that\r\nwherever the regiment has gone that flag has gone too. Down the main\r\nstreet of the town I go, past the drinking fountain placarded; “Do not\r\ndrink, good only for animals,” but at which, nevertheless, the doughboys\r\nfrequently refresh themselves, cheerfully risking death, not to mention\r\na court-martial, in order to get a drink of unmedicated water; and out\r\nalong the Rue Dieu until I turn off the highway just beyond the village\r\nwash-house. The wash-house, known to the French as _la Fontaine_, is a\r\nbeautiful little building like a tiny stone chapel, with tall arched\r\nwindows filled with iron grills. Through the centre runs a long oblong\r\npool; at its brim the women kneel to do their scrubbing, handsome\r\npeasant wenches many of them, with fresh, high coloring. Often one sees\r\na soldier leaning against the grill, engaged in some attempt at\r\ngallantry through the bars. Sometimes one even glimpses a form in olive\r\ndrab kneeling by the side of one of the peasant girls, he scrubbing his\r\nsocks, and she her stays, while she gives him a lesson in French and in\r\nlaundering _à la Française_. When the Americans first came to Saint\r\nThiebault they had only a small-sized guard-house. Then came one\r\nhistoric payday when after months of penury the troops were paid. That\r\nnight the accommodations at “the brig” proved inadequate and the\r\nwash-house had to be requisitioned for the over-flow. This was well\r\nenough until the lodgers fell to fighting among themselves and so fell\r\nheadlong into the pool. Then such a hullabaloo broke loose that the\r\nwhole camp turned out to see who had been murdered.\r\n\r\nBack of the wash-house lies a group of long French barracks, and here\r\nlives Company A of the —— Regiment, infantry and “regulars.” Beyond the\r\nmess-hall is the hut, a French _abri_ tent with double walls. Ducking\r\nunder the fly, one finds oneself in a long rectangular canvas room,\r\nlighted by a dozen little isinglass windows. The room is filled with\r\nfolding wooden chairs and long ink-stained tables over which are\r\nscattered writing materials, games and well-worn magazines. Opposite the\r\ndoor, at the far end, is the canteen counter, a shelf of books at one\r\nside, a victrola and a bulletin board, to which cartoons and clippings\r\nare tacked, on the other. Back of the counter on the wall, held in place\r\nby safety pins, are the hut’s only decorations, four of the gorgeous\r\nFrench war posters brought with me from Paris. There are two stoves\r\nresembling umbrella-stands for heating in the main part of the hut and\r\nbehind the counter another, about the size and shape of a man’s derby\r\nhat, on which I must make my hot chocolate. For lights at night I am\r\ntold that occasionally one can procure a few quarts of kerosene and then\r\nthe lamps that stand underneath the counter are brought out and for a\r\nfew days we shine; but usually we manage as our ancestors did with\r\ncandle-light. Our candlesticks form a quaint collection; some are real\r\ntin _bourgeois_ brought from Paris, some strips of wood, some\r\nchewing-gum boxes, while others are empty bottles, “dead soldiers” as\r\nthe boys call them. As for the bottles, I am particular about the sort\r\nthat I employ and none of mine are labeled anything but Vittel Water.\r\nOthers I observe are not so circumspect,—yesterday I chanced in at a\r\ncanteen in a neighboring village kept by a Y man; on a shelf three “dead\r\nsoldier” candlesticks stood in a row and their labels read; Champagne,\r\nCognac, Benedictine! For the rest, the hut is equipped with a wheezy old\r\npiano, a set of parlor billiards, and a man secretary. It is invariably\r\ndense with smoke, part wood and part tobacco, and usually crowded with\r\nboys.\r\n\r\nThe first night after the Chief had taken me over to call at my canteen\r\nand I had had one cursory glance at them, I came back feeling that my\r\nhut contained the roughest, toughest set of young ruffians that I had\r\never laid eyes on. The second night I came home and fairly cried myself\r\nto sleep over them—they seemed so young, so pitiful and so puzzled\r\nunderneath their air of bravery, so far away from anything they really\r\nunderstood and everybody that was dear to them. It was Cummings in\r\nparticular I think who did it for me. He owns to seventeen but I would\r\nput fifteen as an outside estimate. A mere boy who hasn’t got his growth\r\nyet, with soft unformed features and a voice as shrill as a child’s, I\r\nam sure he ran away from home to go to war just as another lad might\r\nhave run away to see the circus. Although the regiment is a regular army\r\norganization, a large part of the men were raw recruits only last\r\nsummer, a fact which causes the old-timers, whose service dates from\r\nBorder days or before, no little regret.\r\n\r\n“This Man’s Army ain’t what it used to be,” they complain; “it’s getting\r\ntoo mixed.”\r\n\r\nThe “veterans” have a stock saying which they employ to put the\r\nyoungsters in their places: “Call yourself a soldier do you? Why I’ve\r\nstood parade rest longer than you’ve been in the army!”\r\n\r\nThis is sometimes varied, when the speaker happens to be the tough sort,\r\nby; “Huh! I’ve put more time in the guard-house than you have in the\r\narmy!”\r\n\r\nTonight a boy came up to the counter and asked: “Goin’ to serve hot\r\nchocolate tonight?”\r\n\r\n“Sure thing!”\r\n\r\n“Then I guess I won’t go out and get drunk.”\r\n\r\nIt’s going to be hot chocolate or die in that hut every night after\r\nthis!\r\n\r\n\r\nBourmont, November 31.\r\n\r\nI don’t like my uniform. I don’t like women in uniform anyway. I suppose\r\nit is because one is so used to the expression of a woman’s personality\r\nin dress that when she dons regulation garb she seems to lose so much.\r\nAnd then to really carry off a uniform requires a flair, a dash, a\r\nswagger, and such are rarely feminine possessions. The consensus of\r\nopinion seems to bear me out.\r\n\r\n“Of course I think women in uniforms look very snappy,” confided a lad\r\nto me today; “but somehow they don’t look like women to me!”\r\n\r\n“_Pas joli_,” says Monsieur le Commandant severely, referring to my hat.\r\n“_Pas joli!_” But when I put on my old blue civilian coat he fairly goes\r\ninto raptures.\r\n\r\n“Be-u-ti-ful!” he ejaculates. “Be-u-ti-ful! _Toilette de ville. Pas\r\ntoilette de Y. M. C. A.!_”\r\n\r\nBesides the suit and cape I had made in Paris, they gave me two canteen\r\naprons, aprons such as French working women wear, voluminous, beplaited,\r\nmade in Mother Hubbard style. Now there is one point on which I am\r\nresolved. They can court martial me, they can send me home, or they can\r\nlead me out and shoot me at sunrise, but they cannot make me wear those\r\naprons! What’s more, the very first minute that I have to myself I’m\r\ngoing to cut them up and make them into canteen dish-cloths.\r\n\r\n\r\nBourmont, December 3.\r\n\r\nThis French money is the very plague; not because it is French but\r\nbecause it is so flimsy. It may perhaps measure up to the national\r\nstandards, but it fails utterly to meet American requirements; the\r\ndifference lying chiefly in the fact that the French don’t shoot craps.\r\nIt comes into the canteen in all stages of disintegration.\r\n\r\n“She’s kinder feeble. Will she pass?” inquires a lad anxiously.\r\n\r\n“With care maybe, and the help of a little sticking plaster,” I reply;\r\nand getting out the roll of gummed paper kept handily in the\r\ncash-drawer, I proceed to patch up the tattered bill.\r\n\r\n“Guess this one must have been up to the front; it’s all shot to\r\npieces,” another lad apologizes; then, at my casual references to\r\nshooting craps, grins guiltily. “But say now, ain’t it the rottenest\r\nmoney you ever did see?” “The United States ought to teach these\r\nFrenchies how to make paper money,” remarks a third; while still another\r\nadds; “When I’m to home I write to my girl on better paper than that.”\r\n\r\nSometimes the bills come in as a mere mass of crumpled tatters; then one\r\nmust play picture-puzzle piecing it together. Sometimes they are beyond\r\nrepair; for at times you will receive two halves of different notes\r\npasted neatly together, or at other times one with the corner bearing an\r\nessential number lacking. The French banks refuse to pay a cent on their\r\npaper money unless it is just so.\r\n\r\n“I’m sorry, but that bill’s no good,” you will occasionally have to tell\r\na boy. Usually he will grin cheerfully as he stuffs it back into his\r\npocket.\r\n\r\n“Oh well, I’ll pass it along in a crap game.”\r\n\r\nThen too, the boys have no respect for foreign money and so handle it\r\ncarelessly with an obvious contempt that is irritating to the French.\r\n\r\n“Tain’t real money,” they declare.\r\n\r\nThe paper francs and half-francs they call “soap coupons.”\r\n\r\n“Why, you might just as well be spendin’ the label off a stick o’\r\nchewin’ gum!” they jeer.\r\n\r\nNext to the paper money that comes to pieces in their fingers, the boys\r\ndetest the big one and two cent coppers. Known to the navy as\r\n“bunker-plates,” in the army they pass as “clackers.” “You get a\r\npocket-full o’ them things and you think you’ve got some money, and all\r\nthe time it ain’t more than ten cents altogether,” they grumble.\r\n\r\n“I can’t be bothered carryin’ that stuff around,” they declare when I\r\nbeg them to pay me in coppers. “I always throw ’em away or give ’em to\r\nthe kids.” A prejudice which greatly complicated the matter of making\r\nchange until I had an inspiration. Now I give them their small change in\r\nboxes of matches or sticks of chewing gum.\r\n\r\nThen there is the annoyance of the local money. Since the war, the\r\ncities of France have taken to issuing their own paper francs and\r\nhalf-francs. We accept all this local money in the canteens and send it\r\nto Paris to be redeemed. But the French tradespeople in general refuse\r\nto honor these bills except in the city that issues them or its\r\nimmediate vicinity. Many a puzzled doughboy has been driven to indignant\r\nprotest or even to “chucking the stuff away” in his exasperated disgust\r\nwhen told by the shopkeepers that his paper money was _pas bon_. But the\r\ngrievance is not quite all on one side: no small amount of worthless\r\nMexican money, brought over by Border veterans, I am told, was palmed\r\noff on shopkeepers at the port when the Americans first landed!\r\n\r\nIn contrast to their disdain for this foreign currency the boys cherish\r\nto a degree that is half funny, half pathetic, any specimens of “real\r\nmoney” that they are lucky enough to possess.\r\n\r\n“Say, I had an American dollar bill in my hand the other day,—I felt\r\njust as if the old flag was waving over me!” And another lad; “Saw a U.\r\nS. Dollar bill today. Oh boy! but it looked a mile long to me!”\r\n\r\nIf anyone displays an American greenback at the counter a little riot is\r\nsure to ensue. All the boys nearby crowd about, feast their eyes on it,\r\ntouch it, pat it, kiss it even.\r\n\r\n“Lemme see!” “Ain’t she a beauty?” “That’s the real stuff!” “Say, how\r\nmuch will you sell her for?”\r\n\r\nEven the half-dollars, quarters and dimes are precious.\r\n\r\n“You don’t get that one,” they say as they pull a handful of change from\r\ntheir pockets. “That’s my lucky piece. I’m savin’ that there little ol’\r\nnickel to spend on Broadway.”\r\n\r\nFrench money, Belgian money, Swiss money, English money, Spanish money,\r\nItalian money, Greek money, Canadian money, Luxembourg money,\r\nIndo-Chinese money, money from Argentine Republic, and yesterday a\r\nGerman mark even, all come across the counter and go into the till\r\nwithout comment. But when any American money comes in I always feel\r\nbadly over it. For, be it a crisp five dollar bill, an eagle quarter or\r\nonly a buffalo nickel I know it signifies just one thing,—bankruptcy.\r\n\r\n\r\nBourmont, December 7.\r\n\r\nTo be a corporal in the Ninth Infantry, it is said, a man must be able\r\nto speak eight languages, one for each soldier in his squad. The same\r\ncould be said with almost equal truth of our regiment. I don’t know\r\nwhether it is this mixture of many nationalities that gives my family\r\nits flavour; be that as it may, Company A has more color, more\r\ncharacter, more individuality to the square inch than I had dreamed any\r\nsuch group could possess. And they are so funny, so engaging in their\r\ninfinite variety and their child-like naivete!\r\n\r\nFirst there are Gatts and Maggioni; Gatts, lean, tall, honest-eyed, with\r\na grin that won’t come off and a quaint streak of humour,—Gatts who\r\nlooks pure Yankee, but is, if the truth were told, three-quarters\r\nGerman,—Gatts who hangs about my counter hour after hour; and by his\r\nside sticks little Maggioni, who told the recruiting officer that he was\r\nseventeen but whose head just tops the canteen shelf, and who looks,\r\nwith his pink cheeks and his great dark eyes, like nothing in the world\r\nbut an Italian cupid in the sulks. The two have struck up the oddest\r\ncomradeship.\r\n\r\n“Me an’ Gatts, we’re goin ’to stick side by side,” explains Maggioni,\r\n“an’ if I see a crowd o’ Germans pilin’ onto him, why I’ll just go right\r\nafter ’em, an’ if too many of ’em come for me ter oncet, why Gatts here,\r\nhe’ll just lay right into ’em.”\r\n\r\nAnd Gatts nods, looking down at Maggioni with a parent’s indulgent eye.\r\n\r\n“He thinks he’s a tough guy for sich a little feller,” he comments\r\nreflectively; “but he’s the only one in the regiment that knows it.”\r\n\r\n“You all think I’m mighty little!” snaps the cupid. “When I joined at\r\nSyracuse everybody said to me ‘Baby, where’d you leave your cradle?’ But\r\nlemme tell you, I’ve growed since I’ve been in the army!”\r\n\r\n“Waal I do believe there’s one part of him that’s growed;” Gatts is very\r\nsolemn.\r\n\r\n“What’s that?” I ask.\r\n\r\n“His feet.”\r\n\r\nPrivate Gatts has promised me one of the Kaiser’s ears!\r\n\r\nThen there is Brady, “Devil Brady” the little black Irish coal-miner\r\nfrom Oklahoma, who spends his days trying to get put in the guard-house,\r\nso he won’t have to drill.\r\n\r\n“I’m plumb disgusted,” he confided to me today. “I never worked so hard\r\nin my life as I did the other night gettin’ drunk, an’ then the guard\r\nwas so much drunker than I was, I had to carry him to the guard-house. I\r\nthought sure they’d give me thirty days at least, but they only kept me\r\ntwenty-four hours and then out!”\r\n\r\n“Hard luck,” I sympathized.\r\n\r\n“I just knew how it would be,” he mourned. “It was Friday the thirteenth\r\nwhen I joined the army; there were just thirteen of us fellers, and the\r\nthirteenth was a nigger.”\r\n\r\nHe tells me the most wonderful yarns about the miners and their pet\r\nrats, about explosions and disasters and rescue parties. Last night he\r\ntold me the story of one mine-horror that will stick in my memory.\r\n\r\n“And we shoveled the last three men and a mule into one bag,” he\r\nfinished.\r\n\r\nNow and then I catch a glimpse of Jenicho the Russian giant, but he is\r\nvery shy. A huge lumbering fellow, sluggish, and seemingly stupid, with\r\nlittle pig eyes that are quite lost to sight when he smiles, Jenicho is\r\nthe butt of the Company. When he joined the regiment last summer, they\r\ntell me, he knew no word of English. The first phrase that he acquired\r\nwas; “You no bodder me.” For the boys can’t resist the temptation to\r\nplague Jenicho, and though his strength is such that if he once should\r\nget his hands on his tormentors he could break them into bits, he is so\r\nslow withal that they always can elude him. Not long ago Jenicho was\r\nwalking post one night when the Officer of the Day hailed him and\r\nannounced himself. To which Jenicho lustily responded; “Me no give damn.\r\nMe walk post, gun loaded, bay’net fixed. You no bodder me. Me shoot!”\r\nAnd the Officer of the Day discreetly walked on.\r\n\r\nThen there is little Philip R. who plays our decrepit old piano quite\r\nbrilliantly by ear, and who is, he tells me, half Greek and half\r\nEgyptian. Philip R. is the pet of a French family in one of the\r\nneighboring villages. He stopped at a house to ask for a drink of water\r\nwhen out walking one day. Madame asked him in, pressed him to stay to\r\nsupper. The family made much of him, and all because forsooth he was the\r\nfirst “American” they had ever seen. Since then he has been a constant\r\nwelcome visitor.\r\n\r\nThere is St. Mary too. If you can conceive of a cherub eating watermelon\r\nyou have a perfect picture of St. Mary. St. Mary converses entirely in\r\nwords of one syllable and very few at that. He makes smiles serve for\r\nspeech. St. Mary loses everything he owns; not long ago he lost his\r\novercoat, now he has lost his bayonet. Yet St. Mary is the best natured\r\nboy in the company; he needs to be. When St. Mary helps me stir the\r\nchocolate it seems as if half the company lined up on the other side of\r\nthe counter to shout; “St. Mary! Take your dirty hands out er that there\r\nchocolate!” and St. Mary never says a word but grins until his eyes are\r\nnothing but little slits and ducks his head until only the curls on top\r\nare visible.\r\n\r\n“St. Mary, he’s kind o’ simple,” explains Private Gatts. “But there\r\nain’t anybody in camp that’s got a better heart.”\r\n\r\nAnd there is Bruno, Angelo Bruno, a little grinning goblin of a man, but\r\nstrong, they say, as a gorilla. Bruno gives the non-coms no end of\r\ntrouble; he’s a “tough nut to manage.” Whenever he is told to do\r\nanything that does not suit his tastes, he merely shrugs his shoulders,\r\n“No capish,” and that’s the end of it. The other day while on guard he\r\nwas interrogated by the Officer of the Day.\r\n\r\n“What’s your name?”\r\n\r\n“Bruno.”\r\n\r\n“What are your general orders?”\r\n\r\n“Angelo.”\r\n\r\nThe Officer gasped, thought he would try again. “What are your special\r\norders?”\r\n\r\nBruno saw a light. “They’re ina my pock!”\r\n\r\nWhen I first came to Saint Thiebault I was puzzled by the silver\r\nhalf-francs in my cash drawer which were bent in the middle, some of\r\nthem so far as almost to form a right-angle. Then the boys explained.\r\nBruno was once a strong man in a circus sideshow. He did things with his\r\nteeth. The crooked half-francs were the results of his exhibiting his\r\nprowess to the boys. So now when damaged half-francs appear I know that\r\nour little Angelo has been trying his teeth again. At present our social\r\nintercourse with Bruno is limited. He is serving thirty days in the\r\nguard-house. But every day or two he slips into the hut to do his\r\nshopping, the kind-hearted guard standing at the door, as he does so, a\r\nsheepish look on his face. If there is one military duty which the\r\ndoughboy hates above all others, it is this job of “chasing prisoners,”\r\nand when you meet a file of guard-house habitués escorted by a rifle in\r\nthe rear, it is invariably the guard, and not the prisoners, who looks\r\nthe culprit! The interest of Bruno’s visits lies largely in seeing what\r\nis his latest acquisition in the way of jewelry. For Bruno has a pretty\r\ntaste for finery and enlivens the dull evenings of his captivity by\r\nwinning away the ornaments of his fellow prisoners. Already he has come\r\ninto the canteen decked out with seven large rings and a fat watch and\r\nchain. Today he appeared with his latest prize, a pair of gold-rimmed\r\neye glasses. They are hideously unbecoming, they pinch his nose so that\r\nit hurts, moreover he can’t more than half see out of them, and yet it\r\nis quite evident those eyeglasses are the pride of his heart.\r\n\r\nLast week our Secretary conceived a big idea. He would educate A\r\nCompany. He would teach them to read, write and speak English. He\r\nstarted a class. On the first night there was a large crowd, eager and\r\ninterested; the second night there were six, the pupils when sought out\r\ncomplaining they were “tired” or “busy;” the third night there was Saint\r\nMary who made one; the fourth night the class died an easy death. I am\r\nafraid Company A is going to continue uneducated. As Brady said:\r\n\r\n“There were just two things I learned in school; one was to throw a spit\r\nball, the other was to bend a pin convenient for somebody to sit on.”\r\nAnd it looks as if it would have to go at that.\r\n\r\n“Why, those birds don’t even understand their own names,” complain the\r\nofficers; “except on payday, and then they’ll answer no matter _how_ you\r\npronounce them.”\r\n\r\n\r\nBourmont, December 9.\r\n\r\nThere is something queer about me. I don’t mind the mud, I don’t mind\r\nthe rain, I don’t mind the hill, I don’t even mind the mess. Of course I\r\nadmit that the food isn’t quite what one is used to, and the\r\nsurroundings are a trifle unsavoury, but it is, after all, so much\r\nbetter than the state of semi-starvation that I was led to half\r\nanticipate, that I for one am quite content.\r\n\r\nOur mess is held at the house of an old couple who live a little way\r\nabove our billet on the hill. The house was differentiated from the\r\nothers in the row by a spindling and discouraged tree which stood in a\r\ngreen tub outside; as this was the only tree in front of a house on the\r\nwhole street it has always been easy to pick out our otherwise\r\nundistinguished entrance. Last night however, the weather waxing colder,\r\nthe tree moved indoors. This morning the whole Y. personnel wandered\r\ndistractedly up and down the hill trying to identify the mess-house\r\ndoor, until some kindly villagers, sensing the situation, came out on\r\ntheir front steps and pointed us to the place.\r\n\r\nThe house, like most of the village dwellings, consists, downstairs, of\r\njust two rooms. In the front room the family cooks, eats and spends its\r\ndays. In the back room the family sleeps, and here we have our mess. The\r\ndrawback of this arrangement is that one has to pass through the kitchen\r\nin order to reach the dining-room and this is likely to spoil one’s\r\npleasure in the meal that follows. As for me, I go on the principle that\r\nwhat one doesn’t know won’t take one’s appetite away, and so hurry\r\nthrough the kitchen with one eye shut and the other fixed on the door\r\nahead of me.\r\n\r\nSaid my right-hand neighbor to my left-hand neighbor at supper the other\r\nday, as he offered him the _pièce de résistance_ of the meal:\r\n\r\n“You aren’t taking rice tonight?”\r\n\r\n“Thanks no. Saw the old lady picking ’em out this noon.”\r\n\r\n“That’s nothing. I saw the old man picking ’em out of the beans\r\nyesterday.”\r\n\r\nBut why should people come to war if they are going to be so squeamish?\r\n\r\nA few days ago one rash soul among us conceived a hankering for salad.\r\nShe went to Madame and, being ignorant of the French word, demanded\r\nsimply.\r\n\r\n“_Avez-vous_ lettice?”\r\n\r\nMadame shook her head uncomprehending, but finally as the words were\r\nrepeated a light dawned.\r\n\r\n“_Ah oui, oui, oui!_”\r\n\r\nShe turned and hurried upstairs, descending triumphantly a moment later\r\nwith a large bundle of old letters! In just what form she expected us to\r\nhave them served I have not yet been able to ascertain.\r\n\r\nThe mess-room is so crowded that to reach a seat often requires\r\nconsiderable manœuvering. In one corner stands an ancient dressmaker’s\r\ndummy—by popular vote awarded as sweetheart to the most bashful man at\r\ntable; in the corner opposite is the bed of Madame and Monsieur. The men\r\nwho get up for early breakfast, swallow their bread and jam and coffee\r\nwith Monsieur watching from his couch of ease. Today Madame was\r\nindisposed and when we came to supper we found that she had retired\r\nalready. All through the meal she lay there, under the red feather-bed,\r\nlooking like a dingy, weazened old corpse, staring at the ceiling, her\r\nmouth wide open.\r\n\r\nFor the last few days we have had a visiting clergyman with us. To all\r\nappearances a meek and long-suffering little man, he has been giving\r\nspecial revivalistic discourses at the huts and eating at our mess. This\r\nmorning he was asked to say grace. In the middle of a long and earnest\r\nexhortation I was startled to hear these words: “Oh Lord, Thou knowest\r\nwe are apt to grow lean and to starve in Thy service!” I fairly had to\r\nstuff one of the one franc canteen handkerchiefs, which serve as napkins\r\nat the mess, into my mouth to keep from laughing.\r\n\r\n\r\nBourmont, December 12.\r\n\r\nIn Paris a man who lectured to us said: “Get the fellows who have\r\ninfluence with you, and you can swing the crowd.” Sometimes I think that\r\nif Pat were our enemy instead of our friend we might almost as well shut\r\nup the hut. For Pat the sharp-shooter, Pat the dare-devil, Pat, who in\r\ncompany phrase “has Harry Lauder and George Cohen stopped in a hundred\r\nplaces,” Pat the happy-go-lucky adventurer is one of the leading spirits\r\nin Company A. He has served, it seems, already in the war with the\r\nCanadian army.\r\n\r\n“But how did you get out of it?” I asked.\r\n\r\nWhereupon Pat regaled me with a wonderful rigmarole involving an\r\nextraordinary case—his own—of shell-shock out of which I could make\r\nneither head nor tail. Later, from one of the Secretaries who had been\r\nat Saint Thiebault before I came, I learned the truth. When America had\r\ndeclared war, Pat had deserted from the Canadian in order to enlist in\r\nthe American army. Pat had showed him a letter from one of his old-time\r\nfriends; it ended:\r\n\r\n“Of course I wouldn’t think of splitting on an old pal like you, Pat,\r\nbut I do need twenty dollars like hell.”\r\n\r\n“What did you do?” asked the Secretary.\r\n\r\n“Sure an’ I sent him the money,” grinned Pat.\r\n\r\nShortly after I first became acquainted with him, Pat, who is naturally\r\ngallant, with a tongue inclined to blarney, extracted a promise from me.\r\nSome day, after the war, if we should happen to meet, say, strolling\r\ndown Fifth Avenue, Pat “dressed in a nice blue serge suit” is going to\r\n“take me away from the other feller” and take me out to dinner. It was\r\nafter solemly pledging my word to this agreement that I learned that Pat\r\nhad formerly been a saloon keeper and had had an extensive police-court\r\nrecord. Immediately I began to hope that Pat would forget that post-war\r\nparty, but not he. Instead, he is constantly reminding me of it, always\r\nbefore an audience, dwelling on it and elaborating it, until now I find\r\nit has grown from a mere dinner, to dinner, the theatre and a dance!\r\n\r\nLithe, wiry, lean-faced with close-cropped hair, pale blue gimlet eyes\r\nand an almost unvarying expression of intense seriousness on his face,\r\nPat, when present, is the life of the hut. Forever at his clowning, you\r\nwould never dream from his demeanour that Pat’s domestic affairs are in\r\na state little short of catastrophic. His wife, according to her\r\nphotograph a handsome, sullen, passionate type, half Mexican, ran away\r\nabout a year ago, taking with her all his money that happened to be\r\nhandy, together with his new automobile. Encountering some of Pat’s\r\nfriends, she had explained her apparently care-free single state by\r\ntelling them that Pat was dead. Now she has discovered that Pat is in\r\nFrance, she is all for reconciliation. She has written him a letter in\r\nwhich she addresses him as her dear husband about six times to each\r\nsheet, informing him that she needs money, and inquiring of him what he\r\nwished her to do with his clothes.\r\n\r\n“What did you answer?” I asked, for Pat, who must always share his\r\ncorrespondence, had shown me the letter.\r\n\r\n“I told her,” grinned Pat, “she cu’d keep the clothes and maybe she’d\r\nfind another man to fit ’em.”\r\n\r\nBut there is another and more serious side to the matter. It seems that\r\nthe lady in the case has written to the Captain of A Company, requesting\r\nhim to forward a large proportion of Pat’s pay to his deserving and\r\nindigent wife. Whether or not this will be done is still uncertain. Pat\r\nrefuses to discuss the possibilities, but from the glint in his eyes I\r\nhave a premonition that if next pay day Pat finds any considerable\r\ndeduction made from his pay, that that night one wild Irishman will run\r\namuck in Saint Thiebault.\r\n\r\nOccasionally in the midst of Pat’s racy discourses I overhear things not\r\nmeant for my ears, such as his remarking how in Rochester once he “went\r\non a seven day’s pickle in company with a female dreadnut.” But usually\r\nhe is very careful to only “pull gentle stuff” in my hearing. The other\r\nday he delivered himself of a wonderful dissertation on the\r\ndeceitfulness of pious people, ending with this gem;\r\n\r\n“So whenever I see one of these guys comin’ towards me with a gold crown\r\non his bean, looking’ as if he couldn’t sin if he had to, why I nip\r\ntight on to my pocketbook and I cross to the other side of the street!”\r\n\r\nToday Pat came into the canteen with a newspaper clipping and a letter\r\nto show me. The letter was from the Chief of Police of K——, one of the\r\nmany cities in which Pat has resided during his short but crowded life,\r\nthe clipping from the K—— Daily Sheet. The clipping was comprised of a\r\nletter which Pat had written to the Chief of Police giving in humorous\r\nphrase his version of life in France and an accompanying paragraph\r\nstating that though the writer had given the police force no little\r\nanxiety during his residence in K——, still he had been in spite of all,\r\na good-hearted and likable rascal, and now that he had gone to war for\r\nhis country, bygones should be bygones and K—— must be proud of him. The\r\nletter from the Chief was in much the same vein.\r\n\r\n“Yes,” ruminated Pat; “I kept the old feller pretty busy, though me an’\r\nhim were friends just the same. But it sure would get the old man’s\r\ngoat, just after he’d had me up and fined me, to come home and see me\r\nsettin’ at his dinner-table alongside of his pretty daughter.”\r\n\r\n\r\nBourmont, December 14.\r\n\r\nBecause it took too much time right in the most important part of the\r\nday to climb Bourmont Hill for mess at night, I have arranged to take my\r\nsuppers with two little old ladies here in Saint Thiebault. The suppers\r\nare to consist of a bowl of cocoa and a slice of bread with jam. The\r\nlittle ladies supply the bread and milk for the cocoa and I supply the\r\nrest, paying them one franc a day.\r\n\r\nAt half-past five I put on my things, light my little candle-lantern and\r\nset forth. The boys, coming in after mess, will be crowding the hut; a\r\nchorus of anxious voices queries.\r\n\r\n“You’re comin’ back sure, ain’t you?”\r\n\r\nAnd, “What time is that hot chocolate goin’ to be ready?”\r\n\r\nI pick my way down the slippery duck-boards to the highway. Trudging\r\nalong the muddy road, friendly voices hail me from the dark. I am known\r\nby the little light I carry. At number two Rue Dieu I rap and enter,\r\ntrying desperately to leave some of the mud from my boots on the\r\ndoor-step, for in this land of wooden shoes scrapers are as unknown as\r\nthey are unnecessary. Once inside I have to fairly strain my eyes in\r\norder to be able to see anything, for all the light in the room is\r\nsupplied by the embers on the hearth and one tiny gasolene lamp with a\r\nflame not much bigger than the point of a lead pencil. Kerosene is\r\nunobtainable for civilian use; the price of candles is prohibitive.\r\n\r\n“_C’est la guerre. Cest la misère_,” say the little old ladies. “One\r\nmust sit in the dark—“_Cest triste comme ça._”\r\n\r\nMy candle doubles the illumination, yet in spite of that, so strong is\r\nthe instinct for economy, they will not rest easy until they have blown\r\nit out.\r\n\r\nThe little old ladies are cousins. The elder of the two, “Madame,” is\r\nlame and has snow-white hair. She sits by the fire always in the\r\nself-same spot. The younger, “Mademoiselle,” is a tiny dwarfish creature\r\nwith a back that is not quite straight. Over her dark dress she wears a\r\njaunty little scarlet apron sewn with black polka dots. I am grateful\r\nfor that apron; it makes the one bit of color in the sombre room.\r\n\r\nI sit in front of the fire at the round table and sip my chocolate. The\r\ntable has an oil-cloth cover on which is printed a map of France, so as\r\nI eat my supper I can take a lesson in geography. It is a pre-war\r\ntablecloth I fancy; over at one edge shows a slice of Germany. The\r\nlittle old ladies point to that side of the table with scorn, “_Les\r\nsales Bodies sont là!_” they explain.\r\n\r\nI wonder that it doesn’t give them heart-burn to look down and see the\r\ncaptive and devastated districts of France lying beneath their tea cups.\r\nThink of setting your salt-cellar on the city of Lille or your mustard\r\npot on the sacred citadel of Verdun!\r\n\r\nAs I sup I endeavour to converse politely, but as my French is little\r\nmore than camouflage, this is a dubious proceeding. Whenever I prove\r\nparticularly stupid, out of the corner of my eye I catch Madame shaking\r\nher old head at Mademoiselle despairingly.\r\n\r\n“_Elle ne comprend pas!_” she murmurs sotto voce, pityingly; “_elle ne\r\ncomprend pas!_”\r\n\r\nAt odd times they turn an honest penny by doing a little sewing for the\r\nvillagers. But life is very difficult these days: the prices of\r\neverything have gone so high. Why, wooden shoes that cost five francs\r\nbefore the war now fetch fifteen!\r\n\r\nTonight I noticed an item in a Parisian Journal lying by my plate. It\r\nwas to the effect that at the Madeleine that day Mlle. X had married\r\nLieut. Z., a veteran of the war who had lost both arms and both legs. I\r\nshowed it to the little ladies.\r\n\r\n“_Ah oui!_” sighed Mademoiselle with a shiver. “_Elle a beaucoup de\r\ncourage, celle-là!_”\r\n\r\nAnd Madame shook her white head and echoed. “_Oui, elle a beaucoup de\r\ncourage!_”\r\n\r\nUpstairs an American officer is billeted. I fancy his presence supplies\r\na certain dash of romance to the little old ladies’ lives. The Americans\r\nare nice, they say, and make little noise in the village; when the\r\nRussians were here it was different.\r\n\r\n“It will be lonely when the Americans are gone,” sighs Mademoiselle.\r\n“The houses will seem empty.”\r\n\r\n\r\nBourmont, December 18.\r\n\r\nYesterday I explored the top of Bourmont Hill. It is here that the\r\nQuality Folk live, and here are some stately old houses with beautiful\r\ncarved doorways and even an occasional gargoyle. Here too the general\r\ncommanding the Division lives, and I have often observed with glee\r\ncorpulent colonels and rotund majors puffing and blowing and growing red\r\nin the face as they climbed the hill to Headquarters. At the top of the\r\nhill there are two churches. Some two weeks ago, it is whispered, a spy\r\nwas caught signaling from the tower of Notre Dame. His signals, it is\r\nsaid, were flashed to another spy stationed on the hills to the east,\r\nwho in turn sent the messages on to the lines. The Curé of Notre Dame is\r\nbeing held under suspicion of complicity.\r\n\r\nFrom Notre Dame an avenue bordered by magnificent old trees sweeps\r\naround to the Calvary, a tall wooden cross surmounting a curious\r\nstructure of rough stone, ringed about with shallow steps—the Mecca of\r\nmany pilgrimages. Beyond the Calvary one comes to the Mystery of\r\nBourmont. A faded sign declares _Défense d’éntrée_, but one looks the\r\nother way and slips by. For once past the gate you are in an atmosphere\r\nof enchantment. No one seems to know just what it is, nor how it came\r\nabout; I can get no intelligent explanation from Madame or Monsieur. To\r\nme it seems like the forgotten playground of an old mad king in some\r\nfantastic legend. For here among the trees are stone stairs, walls and\r\nterraces, and, cut in the curiously cleft rocks, are niches and\r\ntunnelled passage-ways, all mantled over now with green moss and ivy,\r\nthe whole making one think of a dream garden out of Mæterlinck.\r\n\r\nComing down Bourmont Hill afterwards I was startled by the beating of a\r\ndrum; looking back I saw a woman, bare-headed, her blue apron fluttering\r\nin the wind, descending the street after me; from her shoulders was\r\nslung the drum which she was beating with a martial vim. It was the\r\ntown-crier, _le tambour_ as the French put it. Arrived at an appropriate\r\nspot, she stopped, pulled out a paper, cried “_Avis!_” and began to read\r\nin a rapid high official monotone. The wash-house was to be closed\r\nbetween two and four o’clock the following afternoon on account of the\r\nnew water system the Americans were installing. Certain requisitions of\r\ngrain were to be levied.... The villagers were notified to call at the\r\nMayory for their bread cards, without which, after such a date, no bread\r\ncould be obtained.... One or two women came to the doors of the houses\r\nand listened. She took no notice of them. The reading over, she rolled\r\nthe paper up with a quick decisive gesture, and resumed her march, the\r\nsharp rub-a-dub-dub of her drum pursuing me all the way to Saint\r\nThiebault.\r\n\r\nOf late the air has become fairly vibrant with disquieting rumours: one\r\ndoes not know what to believe, what to reject.\r\n\r\nThe Germans are massing for a gigantic drive on Nancy. In three weeks,\r\nsome say, the offensive is to begin; three days, say others. Nancy is to\r\nbe another Verdun. If they break through they will pass this way. The\r\nAmerican troops are being withdrawn from this neighborhood: any day the\r\norder may come for us to leave. At Paris the political situation is\r\ndark. Some people even fear a popular uprising against the government. I\r\nhinted at this to Monsieur, he shook his old head hopelessly. But yes,\r\nthings were in a bad way. Now if France only had _Veelson_ at her head!\r\nFrance and _Veelson_! His gesture indicated the grandeur of such a\r\ncontingency. As it was, France lacked a leader. And underneath all this\r\nruns another rumour, still darker, still more disquieting. The French,\r\nthe gallant French, they say, are “laying down.” They are ready to make\r\npeace at any price. They are played out, sick to death of it all!\r\n\r\n“Forty-two months in the trenches!” cried a sergeant _en-permission_\r\nlast night; “It is enough! I am through. Let the Americans do it!”\r\n\r\nAnd this feeling, they tell us, is wide-spread. The people see our\r\nsoldiers day after day, in the training camps, inactive. “What are they\r\nhere for?” they are asking. “Why don’t they fight? Are they going to\r\nwait until it is all over?”\r\n\r\nWill our soldiers, half-trained as they are, and a mere handful, be\r\nforced, to satisfy them, into the trenches?\r\n\r\nIn the canteen I look into the boys’ faces and smile, but my heart turns\r\nsick within me.\r\n\r\n\r\nBourmont, December 20.\r\n\r\nSuch a strange, incredible thing has happened,—a thing that has upset\r\nall my preconceived ideas of human nature. It began with Malotzzi.\r\nMalotzzi as his name betrays is a “wop;” he is also the smallest fellow\r\nin the company which contains many small men. Nor is he only small, but\r\nwith his thin olive-tinted face and his slender body, he looks so\r\ndelicate, so ethereal that you feel a breath of wind might fairly blow\r\nhim away. To the company he is “a good kid, quiet, never makes any\r\ntrouble.” To me he has always seemed an elfin, changeling creature, a\r\nstrayed pixie, whose impishness has turned to gentleness. Child of the\r\ntenements that he is, he is possessed of the most exquisite\r\nold-fashioned courtesy that I have ever yet encountered; and he has the\r\nstarriest eyes of any mortal born.\r\n\r\nNot long ago he came to the counter to show me a post-card from his\r\nsweetheart. It had an ugly picture of a red brick city block upon it,\r\nand the message scrawled in an unformed hand beneath contained little\r\nexcept the simple declaration that when he came home she would go with\r\nhim to the photographer’s over the candy store at the corner and they\r\nwould have their pictures taken together. Yet no flaming and lyric\r\nlove-letter could have rendered him more naively proud. Malotzzi with a\r\nsweetheart! It was absurd, he was nothing but a child! I can well\r\nbelieve that Malotzzi wouldn’t make a very “snappy” soldier.\r\n\r\nThis afternoon when the company was out for drill, a certain Second\r\nLieutenant discovered that Malotzzi hadn’t got his pack rolled up right.\r\nThis was not the first time he had offended in this manner. The\r\nLieutenant had warned him. He was angry. He took Malotzzi over to the\r\nbath-house, stripped off his blouse, tied his hands so he couldn’t\r\nstruggle, and beat him with a gunstrap until he fainted.\r\n\r\nThe story flashed around the camp. When I came back from supper I found\r\nthe boys at white-heat with indignation. They fairly seethed with anger.\r\nI think if the Lieutenant had happened in, they might have killed him.\r\nPresently a little crowd carried Malotzzi in. They rolled back his\r\nsleeves and showed me the great purple welts upon his arms. His back was\r\nall like that, they said. He had to be held up in order to keep his\r\nfeet.\r\n\r\n“You had better take him to the hospital,” I told them.\r\n\r\nThey carried him out again. He is at the hospital now, where he is\r\nlikely to stay for some time. His lungs are delicate and the beating\r\ncaused congestion. The medical officer made a report and the Lieutenant\r\nhas been placed under arrest.\r\n\r\nI have never met the Lieutenant to know him, but curiously, the\r\nSecretary, who messes with the officers, asserts that of all the men\r\nthere this Lieutenant has always appeared as the most clean-spoken, the\r\nmost cultured, the most gentlemanly. And the boys have always considered\r\nhim a very decent sort. The whole thing is absolutely and blankly\r\nincomprehensible to me. There is one explanation the boys offer; which\r\nis that the Lieutenant, having a yellow streak, has lost his nerve at\r\nthe prospect of going to the front, and has done this as a desperate\r\nexpedient, in the hope of being dishonorably discharged. The only other\r\npossible explanation which I can come upon is that the Lieutenant has a\r\nGerman name.\r\n\r\n\r\nBourmont, December 23.\r\n\r\nThe burning question that is on every lip: Will the Christmas turkeys\r\ncome?\r\n\r\nWe had been promised turkey. What’s more I had been promised some of\r\nthat turkey too, at Company A’s mess table. Now uncertainty holds us in\r\ntorment. Every sort of a rumor is rife. Some darkly insinuate that\r\nneighboring organizations have sidetracked those turkeys. Others declare\r\nthat the turkeys, having been smuggled in by night, are now actually in\r\ncamp among us.\r\n\r\n“Huh!” snorts my friend the Tall Kentuckian. “Funny turkeys they have in\r\nthis army! I done heard those turkeys had four legs and a pair of\r\nhorns!”\r\n\r\nOf course Christmas won’t be Christmas without the turkeys, but anyway\r\nwe have done our best to bring Christmas into the hut. The question of\r\nChristmas trees was taken up in the Bourmont office some days ago. An\r\napplication was made to the Mayor; the Mayor referred the matter to the\r\nrepresentative of the Bureau of Forestry. The Bureau of Forestry proved\r\nto be a good scout. He ruminated a while, “Mademoiselle,” said he, “this\r\nmatter is so tied up with red tape, that if one were to unwind it all,\r\nit would be New Year’s before you got your tree. My advice is that you\r\nselect your tree, wait until after dark, then go out, cut it down close\r\nto the ground, and cover the place carefully with snow.”\r\n\r\nTonight when the subject of Christmas trees came up in the canteen I\r\nrepeated this anecdote to the boys. It was then growing dusky. Several\r\nboys immediately disappeared. In an hour they were back again, dragging\r\nnot one, but two beautiful hemlocks. We set up the more perfect one, and\r\ncut the other up for trimmings. With flags, paper festoons, Japanese\r\nlanterns, tinsel which the French call “angel’s hair,” and tree\r\nornaments the hut was transformed in a twinkling as if by magic. Now it\r\nis no longer a muddy-floored tent, but a green bower threaded with\r\nmyriad bits of bright color, and I have really never seen anything of\r\nthe sort that was any prettier.\r\n\r\nYesterday several cases of free tobacco from the Sun Tobacco Fund\r\narrived in camp. The boys in the orderly room opened the cases last\r\nnight and hunted through and through them, trying to find packages which\r\nbore the names of unmarried lady donors. Unfortunately the Misses who\r\ncontributed were few and far between, but hope dies hard.\r\n\r\n“Say, mightn’t Asa be a girl?” the lads are asking me eagerly today.\r\n\r\n“Lucien ain’t a man’s name, is it?”\r\n\r\nEnclosed in each package is a postal-card on which one may, if so\r\ninclined, return thanks to the giver. The boys who are taking the\r\ntrouble to write are doing it frankly with the hope that this may\r\nencourage the recipient to repetition. How to tactfully suggest this\r\nwithout seeming greedy is a problem whose delicacy proves difficult.\r\n\r\n“You tell me how to say it,” they tease.\r\n\r\n“Say, won’t you write it for me, please ma’am?”\r\n\r\nI saw one postal-card accomplished after an evening of concentrated\r\neffort; “Your precious and admired gift,” it began.\r\n\r\nAlready Santa Claus in the person of Mr. Gatts has presented me with a\r\nbeautiful white silk apron embroidered with large bunches of life-like\r\nviolets.\r\n\r\n\r\nBourmont, Christmas Day.\r\n\r\n_Joyeux Noël!_\r\n\r\nAs I came in last night there was a great log burning on the hearth.\r\n\r\n“_C’est la bouche de Noël_,” said Madame and explained how it would burn\r\nall night, then Christmas morning she would take the little end that was\r\nleft and put it away in the loft until the next Christmas: it would\r\nprotect the house from lightning; it was a very ancient custom.\r\n\r\nBack in the _Salle des Assiettes_ I found our table spread as for a\r\nlittle fête with a wonderful cake and a bottle tied up with a bouquet of\r\nchrysanthemums and long ribbon streamers of red white and blue. I was so\r\ninnocent that I supposed at first that the chrysanthemums were in the\r\nbottle, an improvised vase, but Madame quickly enlightened me: “_C’est\r\nle vin blanc_,” she explained to my embarrassment.\r\n\r\nThe Gendarme and I took counsel together as to how we could best express\r\nour feelings on this occasion toward the Family Chaput, the household\r\nhaving been increased over night by the arrival of the married daughter\r\nand her small boy and girl. After various projects had been considered\r\nand abandoned, we finally took the little stand from our room, dressed\r\nit with evergreen and tinsel, then heaped it with nuts, candies,\r\nchocolate bars, and little jars of jam all from the canteen, together\r\nwith a few small toys, and carried it in and placed it in front of the\r\nhearth. The family appeared delighted. We observed, however, that after\r\nthe first toot, baby Max’s whistle was swiftly and silently confiscated.\r\nLater when _La Petite_, the little maid-of-all-work who takes care of\r\nour rooms, came in, we had a few trinkets dug from the depths of our\r\ntrunks to bestow on her. Later still I carried chocolates and\r\n_confiture_ to my little old ladies of the Rue Dieu.\r\n\r\nThis Christmas day I fancy will be long remembered by the inhabitants of\r\nthis part of France; for in every one of the villages about, our\r\nsoldiers have given the French children a Christmas tree. I went to see\r\nthe tree at Saint Thiebault. The ancient church, its chill interior\r\nablaze with light, was crowded with villagers all dressed in their fête\r\nday best. The old people were just as excited and eager as the children;\r\nnot one had ever seen a Christmas tree before. They stood on the pews in\r\norder to get a better view. The tree which was very large and beautiful\r\nstood just outside the altar rail. It bore a gift for every child in\r\nSaint Thiebault. While the tree was slowly being unburdened of its load,\r\nthe band-master’s choir, high up in the choir-loft, sang an\r\naccompaniment. Some of the selections were of a sacred character, others\r\nfrankly secular, such as Drink To Me Only With Thine Eyes; but as one of\r\nthe choristers remarked;\r\n\r\n“As long as we sing them slow and solemn the Frenchies won’t know the\r\ndifference.”\r\n\r\nAfter the Christmas tree I went around to the little local hospital to\r\ntake some gifts to the patients. There were half a dozen of them lying\r\non cots in the bare barracks room, a dreary set in a drearier setting.\r\nIn one corner lay a boy who muttered incoherently. He had just been\r\nbrought in, they told me, and was very ill: the doctors were puzzled to\r\nknow what was the matter with him. I left some little gifts for him when\r\nhe should be better.\r\n\r\nIt was half-past four when I reached the hut. Suddenly it popped into my\r\nhead that we ought to have a Santa Claus. At half-past six Santa walked\r\nin through the door. It was Pat in a big red nose, a red peaked cap,\r\nmuch white cotton-batting beard and whiskers, rubber boots, the Chief’s\r\nfur coat, covered over for the night with turkey-red bunting, and a fat\r\npack slung over one shoulder. I had just dressed him in the mess hall,\r\nand for an impromptu Santa Claus, I flatter myself he was quite\r\neffective. The boys whooped. When they discovered who it was behind that\r\nnose, they yelped like terriers.\r\n\r\n“Ain’t he the beauty! Oh you whiskers! Say Pat, kiss me quick!”\r\n\r\nWe got Santa safely behind the counter and then opened the pack. It was\r\nfull of foolish little things; tricks, puzzles, games, mottoes,\r\nwhistles, tin trumpets, paper “hummers”. The boys went wild. It was the\r\nmusical instruments that made the hit. For two hours that hut shrieked\r\npandemonium. Every last man in the company tootled and squawked as if\r\nhis life depended on it, and every last one of them was tootling a\r\ndifferent tune.\r\n\r\n“_C’est des grands gosses!_” Truly, as Madame Chaput says, they’re\r\nnothing after all but so many big little boys.\r\n\r\nAfter the stuff was distributed the Secretary and I invited the boys to\r\npartake of hot chocolate and sandwiches. But to our disappointment they\r\nonly took a languid interest in the treat. Instead of the five and six\r\ncups apiece which many often swallow, not one of them consumed more than\r\na cup and three-quarters. Too late we realized; they had already gorged\r\nthemselves on the contents of their Christmas boxes from home.\r\n\r\nReports coming in from the village stated that one American Christmas\r\ncustom had made a strong appeal to the feminine portion at least of the\r\npopulation. Quantities of mistletoe grow hereabouts. The French,\r\nalthough averring that it brings good-luck, consider it a pest and let\r\nit go at that. It took the American doughboys to enlighten the\r\n_Mademoiselles_ as to its Anglo-Saxon significance. It would be curious,\r\nI have been thinking, if the adoption of this ancient privilege should\r\nprove one of the lasting evidences of the American troops in France!\r\n\r\nAs I left the canteen I learned that the boy who had been so sick at the\r\nhospital was dead.\r\n\r\n\r\nBourmont, December 26.\r\n\r\nLast night was a wild night in the barracks. This morning the hut was\r\nfull of echoes of it. Company A indeed wore a jaded look. They had had\r\nvery little sleep it was explained. And it was all on account of the\r\nChristmas hummers.\r\n\r\n“I ain’t got nothin’ against you people, but I shore don’t think you\r\ngave A Company a square deal,” remarked my friend the Tall Kentuckian as\r\nhe lit his cigarette at the counter.\r\n\r\n“Why, didn’t you like the present that Santa Claus brought you?” I\r\nteased.\r\n\r\n“Huh! I would shore have singed the ol’ gentleman’s whiskers for him\r\nlast night if I could have caught him!” He went on to explain; “We’d\r\njust get settled down good to sleep when some guy or other would start\r\nup a-squawkin’ on one of them things. An’ Sergeant ——, well he’d had\r\njust enough to make him fightin’ mad, an’ he shore would rare around\r\nthat there barracks tryin’ to find them fellers. Why, half the corporals\r\nin the outfit was marchin’ up and down the place most all the night\r\nlong, shyin’ hob-nailed shoes in what they guessed was the direction of\r\nthem noises.”\r\n\r\nI began to discern what a night of terror it had been.\r\n\r\n“Yes suh!” declared the Kentuckian. “There was one feller with a hummer\r\nwe couldn’t get. He kept blowin’ Tipperary. He must have blowed it for\r\ntwo hours steady, on an’ off. I guess he had every last hob-nailed shoe\r\nin the hull barracks throwed at him.”\r\n\r\nNor is this all. It seems I have committed a ghastly _faux pas_. I have\r\ngotten the Y. in dreadfully dutch with the officers. It is all along of\r\nthe Christmas calendars. The Christmas calendars arrived at the canteen\r\njust the day before Christmas. They were designed to be sold to the boys\r\nfor five cents apiece in order that they might have something to send to\r\nthe folks at home as a Christmas greeting. But since they reached us so\r\nvery late the Secretary and I decided we didn’t have the face to put\r\nthem on sale.\r\n\r\n“Let’s give them away,” I suggested, and on his agreeing, laid them in\r\nheaps on the counter and invited the boys to help themselves. The boys\r\nweren’t bashful. They helped themselves with enthusiasm and zeal. They\r\ncame back for more and more. For the rest of the day no one did a thing\r\nat the hut but sit at the tables and address envelopes. One boy, I\r\nlearned later, sent off as many as thirty-five. I was awfully pleased to\r\nhave the boys appreciate the calendars so. And I never once for a moment\r\nthought of the censors; but presently I heard from them. The company\r\ncensors, two of the younger lieutenants, had been looking forward, it\r\nseems, to some leisurely care-free hours at Christmas. When the stacks\r\nof calendars started coming in they saw their holiday vanish into thin\r\nair, nay more, they saw themselves sitting up nights for weeks to come\r\ncensoring those precious calendars. And they were swearing, raving mad.\r\nThey were going to run the Y. out of the town! They were going to shut\r\ndown the hut! Finally they compromised the matter with their consciences\r\nby censoring half and chucking the other half into the stove. But even\r\nthen they couldn’t stop fussing and fuming over it. Tonight just to top\r\nthe matter off, we received a sharp reprimand from the Business Manager\r\nat Bourmont for being so extravagant as to give the calendars away,\r\nunauthorized. Was there ever such a tragedy of good intentions?\r\n\r\n\r\nBourmont, December 27.\r\n\r\nToday we buried the lad who died on Christmas night. I had never seen a\r\nmilitary funeral before and I had never dreamed that such a ceremony\r\ncould be so thrillingly beautiful.\r\n\r\nThe company formed at three o’clock in the road in front of the canteen,\r\nthen filed slowly through the streets of the little grey age-old\r\nvillage. The band marching at the head of the procession played the\r\n_Marche Funèbre_ of Chopin. After the band came the officers of the\r\ncompany and then the firing squad of eight sharp-shooters, followed by\r\nan ambulance carrying the boy’s coffin covered with a great flag.\r\nBehind, marched the whole of Company A and after them crowded a throng\r\nof villagers. All the men in town, with the innate respect that the\r\nFrench have for death, stood uncovered as we passed, while many of the\r\nwomen watched with tears streaming down their faces.\r\n\r\nWe passed through the village and down the road to the little\r\ngrey-walled cemetery, ringed around with evergreens and now deep in\r\nfreshly fallen snow. All about stretched virgin shining snowfields and\r\nover them to the east rose Bourmont like a dream city, etched as\r\ndelicately as by a silver-point against the soft dove-colored sky.\r\n\r\nThe majestic phrases of the Catholic burial service rang out clearly on\r\nthe frosty air:\r\n\r\nEternal rest grant him, O Lord,\r\n\r\nAnd let perpetual light shine upon him!\r\n\r\nThe coffin with the great flag burning in blue and scarlet was lowered\r\ninto the grave. Slowly, with perfect expression, a bugler blew the\r\npoignant, unforgettable notes of Taps. The rifles of the firing squad\r\ncracked sharply; three volleys, it was over.\r\n\r\n“Will they leave him there?” An old Frenchwoman asked one of the boys\r\nafterwards.\r\n\r\n“’Till the war is over, then likely they will send him home.”\r\n\r\n“But why? He won’t be lonely here. There will always be some one to put\r\nflowers on his grave.”\r\n\r\nTonight I was talking to the Supply Sergeant about the lad.\r\n\r\n“I think he died of a broken heart as much as anything,” he told me.\r\n“They wouldn’t let his mother see him at the dock when we sailed. She\r\ncame to say good-bye but it was against the rules. He never could get\r\nover that; he kept brooding all the time and fretting for her. I read\r\nsome of her letters to him. They seemed more like a sweetheart’s than a\r\nmother’s.”\r\n\r\nThe doctors, however, diagnosed his disease as spinal meningitis. They\r\nhave ordered the barracks in which he slept to be quarantined. Already a\r\nhalf a dozen boys in quarantine have taken to their beds, but this we\r\nhope is largely due to over-stimulated imaginations. Even if the disease\r\ndoesn’t spread, however, I am wondering what will become of ninety-seven\r\nlively boys bottled up for two weeks in one barracks. Already various\r\nones have eluded the guard and come sneaking furtively into the canteen\r\nto buy their cigarettes and chocolates. Whenever one of these\r\nunfortunates is recognized a regular howl goes up all over the hut.\r\n\r\n“Outside! You’re one of the crumby ones!” they jeer, or; “Convict! Get\r\nback to your cell!”\r\n\r\n\r\nBourmont, December 28.\r\n\r\nThe worst of my job is playing dragon to the French children. In view of\r\nthe fact that if allowed in the hut at all they swarm in, in such\r\nnumbers as to fairly overrun it, and pester the boys with their\r\ninsatiable appeals for “goom” and chocolate, it has seemed best to make\r\na strict rule against their admission. (Besides which I don’t approve of\r\ngiving them gum, for in the face of anything one can do or say they will\r\ninsist on swallowing it, which is, I’m sure, not at all good for their\r\ntummies!) But in spite of this prohibition the place holds an\r\nirresistible attraction for them. At night one can often see their faces\r\npressed flat against the isinglass windows as they peer inside; while\r\nchiefly on Saturday and Sunday afternoons they will slip slyly in, and\r\nthen if the dragon isn’t on the jump to explain to each and every one in\r\nher very best French, that she is so sorry but it really is forbidden,\r\nwhy in a twinkling the hut becomes full of them. And they are so\r\npicturesque, so appealing, so full of shy wonder at the gramophone with\r\nthe wheel that “marches by itself” that it is very hard to turn them\r\nout.\r\n\r\nSince Christmas I have been kept busy by a tiny tad of a ragamuffin with\r\na funny round cropped black head and a face as solemnly expressionless\r\nas a little carved Buddha. He slips in among the tables and he is\r\npositively too small to be seen. The Christmas tree with its shining\r\nornaments is his stealthy objective. In vain I explain matters politely\r\nto him; without a sound, without the hint of a flicker in his little\r\nbeady black eyes, he turns and clumps out in his ridiculous _sabots_,\r\nonly to presently slip in again. And now it seems he has lain low and\r\nsagaciously observed my habits; for returning to the hut after mess this\r\nnoon, I met him trudging along the Rue Dieu, his eyes encountering mine\r\nblandly without embarrassment, his absurd little figure bulging all over\r\nwith purloined Christmas tree ornaments. In the hut I found our poor\r\ntree stripped to a height of four feet from the floor of all its finery.\r\n\r\nThese last few evenings the hut has been given over to writing Christmas\r\nthank-you letters home. The official writer of love letters for the\r\ncompany has been working overtime; not that his clients cannot write\r\nthemselves, but because they feel he is more able to do justice to the\r\nsubject. Every night now I see him sitting out in front of the counter,\r\nhis Jewish profile bent low over the table as he covers sheet after\r\nsheet with his fine and fanciful handwriting, while next him perches\r\nanxiously the interested party, watching developments and occasionally\r\nproffering a suggestion. When it is done they must bring it to me for my\r\napproval.\r\n\r\n“That’s a real classy letter, ain’t it?” the lover will query proudly\r\nand I assure him that it is indeed.\r\n\r\n“When she gets that, I bet she’ll come across with that sweater she told\r\nme she was makin’ for me, all right!”\r\n\r\n“Say do you think that ought to be good for a _cartoon_ of cigarettes?”\r\nanother one inquires.\r\n\r\nOf course there are many who, no matter what the effort, prefer to write\r\ntheir own. Sometimes when cleaning up the canteen tables I come upon\r\nspecimens of such, first drafts discarded on account of blots. One such\r\nlove letter, classic in its brevity, picked up the other day, ran:\r\n\r\n    Dear Sweetheart,\r\n\r\n    I am writing you a few interesting lines which I hope will be\r\n    the same to you wishing you a merry Xmas and a happy New Year\r\n\r\n    Your loving friend\r\n\r\n    Pvt. ——\r\n\r\nOf late I have been moved to speculate wonderingly on the mental\r\nprocesses of the American public. I have been going through the stacks\r\nof magazines in the warehouse sent from the States for one cent per to\r\nprovide amusement for the doughboys’ leisure moments. Among the rest I\r\nfound the Upholsterer’s Monthly, The Hardware Dealer’s Journal, The\r\nMother’s Magazine, Fancy Work and The Modern Needleworker. I showed some\r\nof these prizes to one of the boys; “Gee, but that’s the kind of snappy\r\nstuff to send a feller over the top!” was his comment. That numbers of\r\nthe Undertaker’s Journal have also been discovered among the donations\r\nfrom home I have heard asserted on excellent authority, but as yet I\r\nhave not personally come across any.\r\n\r\nJust as we were closing tonight, Pat came up to the counter, solemnly\r\nleaned across it:\r\n\r\n“Have you seen the new shoes they’re issuin’? he demanded. “They’ve got\r\npitchers on them so a feller can’t see his own feet!”\r\n\r\n\r\nBourmont, January 2, 1918.\r\n\r\nOnce a week our peripatetic movie-machine makes its appearance among us.\r\nLouis, the sixteen year old French operator, unpacks the big cases, sets\r\nup the apparatus, and, if our luck holds, we have a show. Owing to the\r\nshort range of the little machine the screen must be hung in the middle\r\nof the hut. This means that half the audience must view the pictures\r\nfrom the back, the essential difference being that the lettering is then\r\nreversed; “The Jewish Picture Show,” the boys call this. But then as\r\nhalf of us can’t read anyway, why should we mind?\r\n\r\nThe joy of the show lies in the audience. Just as soon as the lights are\r\nput out the fun begins: “Everbody watch their pocketbooks!” goes up the\r\nshout and from that moment we are never still.\r\n\r\nThe curly-headed heroine makes her coquettish entrance.\r\n\r\n“Ooo la la! Oooo la la!” rises the enthusiastic welcome.\r\n\r\nA bottle is displayed; “Cognac!” the yell shakes the roof.\r\n\r\nThe neglected wife begins to waver in response to the tempter’s wiles;\r\n“Now don’t forget your general orders, little lady!” admonishes an\r\nearnest voice.\r\n\r\nLovers indulge in a prolonged embrace; “Aw quit! Quit it! Yer make me\r\nhomesick!” goes up the agonized appeal.\r\n\r\nThe enraptured lover stands registering ecstasy; “Hit him again, he’s\r\ncoming to!” comes the derisive shout.\r\n\r\nAnd so it goes. The actors aren’t on the screen, they’re in the house,\r\nand truly there isn’t a dull moment on the programme!\r\n\r\nLast night, however, instead of the joyous chorus of running comment a\r\nsubdued and decorous silence reigned, broken only by a few half-hearted\r\nsallies. What was the matter? I racked my brain to find the cause. All\r\nthe joy had gone from the show. The evening was stale, flat and\r\nunprofitable. When the lights were lit again the mystery was immediately\r\nmade plain. At one end of the counter stood an officer. I wonder if he\r\ndreamed what a spoil-sport he had been?\r\n\r\nOnce a week also a lady comes from the Bourmont office to give us a\r\nFrench lesson; not that Company A betrays any burning desire to learn to\r\n_parlez-vous_, but just that it seems obviously the proper thing to do\r\nunder the circumstances, so French they must be taught willy-nilly.\r\nThere were two lessons to be sure in which they took a degree of\r\ninterest; the lesson about buying and counting money, and the lesson\r\nabout food and drink. But when they had once learned to ask the price of\r\nthings and to understand the answer, and had learned the words for eggs,\r\nbread, butter, beer, ham, beefsteak, chicken and French fried potatoes,\r\ntheir interest lapsed until it became positive boredom. Of late it has\r\nseemed to me that it was only the boys with French blood that learned\r\nanything and they, of course, knew it all already.\r\n\r\nFor entertainment Company A can upon occasion furnish its own show. This\r\nwas demonstrated by an impromptu programme staged in the hut the other\r\nnight; there’s no use we have discovered in planning things beforehand,\r\nif one does, as sure as fate, all the star performers “catch guard” that\r\nday! Pat by request acted as stage-manager and master of ceremonies. To\r\nstimulate the artists we announced prizes.\r\n\r\nPrivate Dostal opened the programme; a large red-faced lad with a bland\r\nand simple cast of countenance, he is the comic balladist of the\r\ncompany. His first contribution was a selection popularly known among us\r\nas _Beside the dyin’ boxcar, the empty hobo lay_, a piece with a vast\r\nnumber of verses in which the dying hobo repents an ill-spent life,\r\nonly, in the last line, to “jump up and hop the train.” For an encore we\r\nhad _Papa Eating Noodle Soup_ which could best be described as a\r\n“gleesome, gluesome” recitative, the chorus of each of numerous verses\r\nconsisting of a realistic imitation of Papa partaking of the Soup. Mr.\r\nGatts gave us a jig. Then Bruno who, as the boys say; “Could sing pretty\r\ngood, only he don’t sing nothin’ but wop,” favored us with _Oh Maria_,\r\nprefacing his performance with the earnest admonition, “No laffin!\r\nnobody!” and after that with an Italian folk dance in which he looked\r\nmore like a grotesque little punchinello than ever. Our light-weight\r\nboxing champion then gave us _Love’s Old Sweet Song_ and the\r\nheavy-weight champion popularly known as _Magulligan_, together with Mr.\r\nBruno rendered _Bye low my Baby_, antiphonal fashion. The last number\r\nwas furnished by a poilu who had wandered in, in company with one of the\r\nboys. He sang a long dramatic ballad, entitled _The Last Cuirassier_,\r\ndepicting some incident in the Franco-Prussian War. Just what the boys\r\nmade of it I don’t know, but to me it was intensely thrilling, not on\r\naccount of the words for I couldn’t catch them, but on account of the\r\nfervor, the imaginative sympathy, the martial spirit which that old\r\nfellow in his faded trench coat threw into his tones.\r\n\r\nWhen the show was over Pat stood up on the counter and announced that as\r\nlong as all the performances had been of such superlative merit, it was\r\nimpossible for the judges to decide between them. So we handed out a\r\ncouple of packages of “smoking” to each one of the artists, and\r\neverybody was satisfied.\r\n\r\nOnce too we had a party, an athletic stunt party. There were\r\npotato-races and sack-races, string-eating contests, three-legged and\r\nobstacle-races; but the sensational, the crowning event was, of course,\r\nthe pie-race. The pies which were of French manufacture had only been\r\narranged after difficulties: consulting the _boulangère_ at Bourmont I\r\nhad discovered that the calendar now only allows two pie-days per week,\r\nSunday and Wednesday; since the party was to be Friday, pie was\r\nunlawful, unless—and here the law, like all good laws allowed a\r\nloop-hole—unless the pie be made with commissary flour! The pie-race was\r\nthe “dark horse” on the programme. Fearing that if the boys learned\r\nbeforehand of the prospective pie not only would we be mobbed by\r\nwould-be contestants but also that their interest in the rest of the\r\nprogramme would suffer, we had kept the pie-race a profound secret.\r\nSmuggled in when the hut was empty those pies had reposed serenely under\r\nthe counter all afternoon and contrary to my fears not a boy had sniffed\r\nthem! When the proper moment came the pies were placed on a board in the\r\nmiddle of the floor, the contestants, of whom Pat was one, knelt with\r\ntheir hands tied behind them. At the word _go!_ they fell to. The hut\r\nhowled. Then it was discovered that Corporal G. laboured under a cruel\r\nhandicap; _his_ pie was a cherry pie and every cherry had a stone in it.\r\nHalf-way through his pie, Pat, jerking one hand loose, seized a large\r\npiece, plastered it on the head of his opponent opposite; the race ended\r\nin a riot. Strangely enough, when peace was restored not a trace of pie\r\ncould be found anywhere,—nowhere, that is, except in the back hair of\r\nthe contestants.\r\n\r\n\r\nBourmont, January 6.\r\n\r\nNow I know how the prince in the fairy tale felt when he was bidden to\r\nclimb the mountain of glass. For Bourmont Hill is sheeted with ice, and\r\nit is fairly as much as one’s life is worth to attempt to go up or down.\r\nEvery morning I stand and look at that dizzying slide aghast, and wonder\r\nif I may possibly reach the foot alive; then assistance comes, sometimes\r\nin the shape of a French lad in _sabots_, sometimes as a stalwart\r\ndoughboy with a sharp-pointed staff, and together the two of us go\r\nslipping, slithering down the hill-side. In the middle of the road\r\nyelling doughboys, seated on cakes of ice, whiz by at a mad rate of\r\nspeed; long before they reach the bottom of the slope, the ice-cake\r\nsplinters into bits, but the doughboy shoots on downward, sprawling,\r\nspinning like a top, while you hold your breath and gape to see that his\r\nneck isn’t broken. For the French people all this supplies the sensation\r\nof a life-time; they crowd their front doors and their front yards\r\nlaughing, shrieking warning or encouragement, as they watch the progress\r\nof the mad Americans up and down the hill.\r\n\r\n“If one could only have a movie of Bourmont Hill on a day like this!”\r\nsighs the Gendarme.\r\n\r\nThe other day I encountered a sergeant of engineers on the hill-side.\r\n\r\n“You ought to have a sled, Little Girl,” he told me.\r\n\r\n“Well why don’t the engineers make me one?” I unthinkingly retorted.\r\n\r\n“Sure and they will!” he answered.\r\n\r\nSince then I have gone in terror. If the sergeant should have that sled\r\nmade for me, as he likely will, why I shall have to use it. And as for\r\nstarting down Bourmont Hill on a sled, I would just as soon attempt\r\nNiagara in a barrel.\r\n\r\nEver since Christmas it has been cold, bitter cold. At the canteen I\r\nwash my chocolate cups with the dishpan on the stove in order to keep\r\nthe water fluid; hanging the dish-cloth up to dry at the corner of the\r\ncounter, in a few minutes I find it stiff with ice. At night the\r\nink-bottles freeze and then burst, spreading black ruin all around them.\r\nWhat to do with the still unfrozen ones is a vexing problem; I might I\r\nsuppose take them home each night with me and sleep with them underneath\r\nmy pillow. In the little umbrella-stand stoves the green wood, which\r\ncomes in so freshly cut, that the logs have ivy still unwithered twined\r\naround them, simply will not burn, and the stoves will smoke, _mon\r\nDieu_, how they will smoke! Every time the wind blows, the stove-pipes,\r\nsecured shakily by the canvas walls, become disjointed, parting company\r\nwith the stoves, and then the clouds pour forth as if we housed a\r\ncaptive Etna.\r\n\r\nIn the barracks the boys tell me their shoes freeze to the floor over\r\nnight. They have taken to sleeping two in one bunk for the sake of\r\nwarmth. Blanket-stealing has been elevated to the rank of a deadly\r\ncrime. Even the problem of keeping warm by day is an acute one. The boys\r\nwho have money to burn are spending it to purchase extravagantly priced\r\nfur-lined gloves. The boys who can’t afford them, wait until they see\r\nsomebody lay a pair down.\r\n\r\nThe taking of baths has become an act of heroism.\r\n\r\n“Took a bath today,” growls a lad. “Think I ought to get a service\r\nstripe for that.”\r\n\r\nWhile another boy grins; “Gee but I’m feelin’ rich! Took a bath today\r\nand found two pair o’socks and three shirts I didn’t know I had!”\r\n\r\n“Now ain’t you sorry you cut off the bottom of your coat!” a long-coated\r\ndoughboy taunts an abbreviated one. “I told you not to. First, you’re\r\nout of luck at Reveille ’cause the Top Kick can see you ain’t got no\r\nleggin’s on. An’ now before you know it, you’ll be havin’ chilblains in\r\nyour knees.”\r\n\r\n“You should worry,” growls back the short-coated one. “I couldn’t stand\r\nthat thing flappin’ ’round my feet no longer. An’ most of the other guys\r\ndone it too.”\r\n\r\nWhich is true. Before this cold spell set in, half the boys in the\r\ncompany had taken a slice off the bottom of their overcoats, a procedure\r\nwhich leads to an odd effect _en masse_ as each has chosen his own\r\nlength which means everything from knees to ankles, and drives the\r\nexasparated Loots to demanding; “D’you want to know what you look like?\r\nWell, you look like _hell_!”\r\n\r\nIn the village streets snow-ball fights are in order. As soon as the\r\nboys start an offensive, all the inhabitants of the _Faubourg de France_\r\nrun out and put up their shutters. Better to sit in the dark while the\r\nbattle rages than to risk a pane of precious window-glass! Yesterday out\r\nat Iloud the boys caught the Y Secretary, a meek and mild little man, in\r\nthe road and started to give him a thorough pelting. He ran for the hut,\r\nthey chased him, he gained his refuge, locked the door after him; they\r\nproceeded to heap about half a ton of snow against it, making it\r\nimmovable. The unhappy man had to remove a window frame and crawl out\r\nthrough the opening, then spend the rest of the afternoon digging out\r\nhis hut door.\r\n\r\nHere at our billet our little pea-green porcelain stove with the\r\nlavender thistles growing over it has proved to be more ornamental then\r\nuseful. Since the Gendarme is one of your naturally efficient souls, I\r\nfeel that such practical details as building fires belong to her. If she\r\nwishes to coax and cozen the wretched thing for an hour on end, well and\r\ngood. As for me I prefer to go and hug the cook stove in Madame’s\r\nparlor. French fires don’t burn the way American fires do, I tell\r\nMadame. But to her the matter is quite simple. The stove, she says,\r\ndoesn’t understand English.\r\n\r\nToday I met the sergeant of engineers. Some imp impelled me to question\r\njovially;\r\n\r\n“Where’s that sled you promised me?”\r\n\r\n“It’s almost done.” My knees went weak beneath me.\r\n\r\nTonight I confided my apprehensions to the Gendarme. She looked at me\r\nwith an unpitying eye.\r\n\r\n“The more goose you, for encouraging him,” was her cold comfort. “What\r\nare you going to do about it?”\r\n\r\n“I’m going to pray for a thaw,” I told her.\r\n\r\n\r\nBourmont, January 8.\r\n\r\nLife at the Maison Chaput doesn’t flow quite so peacefully these days as\r\nit did before Christmas. The disturbing factor is four-year old Max,\r\nleft by his mother to visit his grandparents. Max is a spoiled child\r\naccording to the Chaput point of view. He is expected to walk a chalk\r\nline with his little red felt toes, and failing this, he is spanked\r\nearly and often. It is unlucky for him that the fagots by the hearth\r\nafford a continual supply of handy switches.\r\n\r\n“The little Jesus will never bring you anything again at Christmas,”\r\nwarns Grandmamma; “never again! And neither will the _Père Nicolas_!”\r\nThen she appeals to me; “All the little children in America are always\r\nwell-behaved, are they not?”\r\n\r\n“But yes, certainly!” I reply, avoiding Max’s eye.\r\n\r\nComing home in the evening I often stop on my way back to the chilly\r\n_Salle des Assiettes_, in response to an urgent invitation, to warm\r\nmyself at the fireplace. Old Monsieur will be sitting on one side of the\r\nhearth and I on the other, while Baby Max toasts his toes in their\r\nscarlet slippers on a stool between us. Sometimes they will sing for me.\r\nMonsieur had a fine voice when he was young and even now he sings with a\r\ndelightful air, a sort of indescribable old gallantry that is a joy to\r\nme. When he and Max sing together the effect is irresistible.\r\n\r\n“Now we will sing _Le Drapeau de la France_,” cries Monsieur. “We must\r\nstand for this!” And Monsieur in his gay red neck cloth and little Max\r\nin his blue checked pinafore stand up before the fire and sing with\r\ntheir hearts in the words “_Saluons le drapeau de la France._” When they\r\ncome to that line, Monsieur le Commandant veteran of 1870 and baby Max\r\nsalute together.\r\n\r\nThen, “_Vive la France!_” I cry, and “_Vive la France!_” they echo.\r\n\r\nWhen new troops pass through town Max must always run to the door to cry\r\n“_Bonjour les Américans!_” a salutation which is often followed I fear\r\nby a request for cigarettes, for Max, baby that he is, enjoys a smoke,\r\nmuch to his grandparents’ amusement.\r\n\r\nAmong the china-ware at the Maison Chaput there is a funny little jug\r\nwhich the Gendarme and I use for fetching hot water. It is made in the\r\nshape of a fat frog with a blue waistcoat and a pipe in one of his\r\nwebbed feet. I had thought it was the famous frog who would a-wooing go,\r\nbut Monsieur has his own explanation. It is the original St. Thiebault\r\ntoad he declares, to tease me. Every time I come to draw a little hot\r\nwater from the stove he must crack the self-same joke.\r\n\r\n“_C’est le crapaud de Saint Thiebault_,” he cries and baby Max pipes up;\r\n“_Il a soif!_”\r\n\r\nYesterday as I was passing through the front room on my way to the\r\ncanteen Monsieur stopped me to draw me into conversation. There were\r\nseveral neighbors present. They gathered in a ring around me. I could\r\nsee they had some weighty question to put to me. After a moment’s\r\nhesitation it came out:\r\n\r\n“_Pourquoi_,” they demanded, “_pourquoi_, does the American soldier blow\r\nhis nose with his fingers?”\r\n\r\nI stared, taken aback. In order to make their meaning quite clear they\r\nillustrated with expressive gestures.\r\n\r\n“Why,” I stammered, “does the poilu never do such a thing?”\r\n\r\n“But never!” they declared in chorus. “The poilu always uses his\r\nhandkerchief!” And again they illustrated in pantomime.\r\n\r\nI labored to explain; the French climate had given the boys colds, and\r\nthe question of laundry and clean handkerchiefs presented\r\ndifficulties....\r\n\r\n“But,” declared old Monsieur sagely, “in America I have heard it is the\r\ncustom. There all the _haut monde_, it is said, lawyers, doctors,\r\nministers, statesmen, blow their noses in that manner!”\r\n\r\nThis was too much. I hurried from the room.\r\n\r\nThis morning Monsieur accused me of being a coquette. Hotly I denied the\r\ncharge. But why then, he rejoined triumphantly, had I asked for a\r\nlooking-glass in my bed-room?\r\n\r\n\r\nBourmont, January 9.\r\n\r\nCompany A is going to China! Somebody heard somebody say that somebody\r\ntold him that the Chaplain had said so. The boys are all excitement over\r\nthe idea.\r\n\r\n“Won’t that be jolly! You’ll all be coming home with little shiny\r\npigtails hanging down your backs!” I tease them.\r\n\r\n“Yes sir! an’ we’ll learn to eat our chow with chopsticks!” I have\r\nsolemnly promised the boys that if Company A goes to China I will go\r\ntoo. What’s more I will learn to make Chop Suey for them. I have always\r\nwanted to visit China.\r\n\r\nThus does the army rumor make sport of us. Reports of this sort\r\nincessantly spring up among us, flourish for a day, to be forgotten on\r\nthe morrow. It is just a sign I suppose of the restlessness that is rife\r\namong the boys, the nostalgia, the rebellion at the grinding monotony of\r\ntheir lives. Half the men in the company, it seems, have gone to their\r\nofficers begging to be transferred into one of the two divisions that\r\nhave already been in the lines.\r\n\r\n“I’m sick o’ this kind o’ life; what I came over here for was to fight,”\r\nthey growl.\r\n\r\nIn the canteen they look at the French National Loan poster which has\r\nthe Statue of Liberty on it, and speculate as to their chances of ever\r\nseeing her again.\r\n\r\n“Oh boy! but I bet there’ll be some noise on board ship when we catch\r\nsight o’ that ol’ gal again!”\r\n\r\n“They wouldn’t be breakin’ my heart if they gave out orders tonight to\r\nstart for home termorrer.” The chorus groans assent. “No sir!” speaks up\r\nPrivate Gatts, “I don’t want to go home until I’ve killed some of them\r\nGermans.”\r\n\r\n“Aw, come off,” rises the incredulous jeer; “you know, if they’d let\r\nyou, you’d start out to walk to Saint Nazaire tonight if you had to\r\ncarry your full pack an’ your rife an’ your extra shoes.”\r\n\r\nTo beguile the tedium they indulge in what appears to be, next to\r\ncrap-shooting, the most popular indoor sport of the A. E. F.—mustache\r\nraising. I don’t believe there’s a man in the company outside of\r\nCummings and Maggioni who hasn’t tried his luck at it. Sometimes it\r\nseems as though an epidemic of young mustaches will break out overnight\r\nas it were. The second lieutenants jeer and witticize in vain. There is\r\none squad who have solemnly pledged themselves to remain mustachioed\r\nuntil they “can the Kaiser;” but for the most part, the little\r\n“Charlies” are fleeting affairs that come and go according to their\r\nowner’s whim. This makes it quite confusing for me, because no sooner\r\nhave I got to know a lad with a mustache by sight, than he shaves it off\r\nand alters his appearance so that I have to learn him all over again.\r\nBut even the excitement of raising a mustache and having your picture\r\ntaken and sending it back home to your best girl and then waiting to\r\nhear what she will say about it, affords only a brief diversion. And\r\nwhen that is done, we are face to face again with the stark sheer\r\nstupidity of drilling and hiking, hiking and drilling, day after day,\r\nweek in and week out, in the slush, the mud, and the rain.\r\n\r\n“Another day, another dollar,” remarks my friend Mr. Brady with\r\nphilosophic resignation as he comes in from walking post at night,\r\n“Betsy the Toad-sticker,” as he familiarly terms his rifle, over his\r\nshoulder.\r\n\r\n“I sure was strong on the patriotic stuff when I enlisted,” mourns a lad\r\ncast in a less stoic mould, “but since I got over here I’ll tell the\r\nworld my patriotism is all shot to pieces.”\r\n\r\n“Who called this here land _Sunny France_, I’d like to know?” is the\r\nindignant question which someone is bound to propose at least once a\r\nday.\r\n\r\n“I’ve only seen the sun twice since I’ve been here,” complained one lad,\r\n“and then it was kind of mildewed.”\r\n\r\n“It stopped raining for three hours the other day,” remarked another,\r\n“an’ I wrote home to my folks an’ told ’em what a long dry spell we’d\r\nbeen having.”\r\n\r\nAltogether we are inclined to take a very pessimistic view at present of\r\nour surroundings.\r\n\r\n“This land is a thousand years behind the times,” is the reiterated\r\ncomment, and who can blame them, having seen nothing of France but these\r\ntiny primitive mud-and-muck villages? “It ain’t worth fightin’ for. Why\r\nif I owned this country I’d give it to the Germans and apologize to\r\n’em.”\r\n\r\n“It ain’t the country, it’s the people in it,” asserted another lad\r\ndarkly.\r\n\r\nWhile the Tall Kentuckian declared, “When I came to France, the height\r\nof my ambition was to kill a German. Now the height of my ambition is to\r\nkill a Frenchman.”\r\n\r\nWhat can one say to them? I try fatuously to comfort by reminding them\r\nof the good time coming when we all get home again. I paint rosy\r\npictures of a grand parade of the division up Fifth Avenue, but they are\r\nsceptical.\r\n\r\n“Huh! That won’t be for us! All the fuss will be for the National Guard\r\nand the draft guys. The reg’lars don’t never get no credit.”\r\n\r\nThen someone will start to hum the song which goes;\r\n\r\n  “O why didn’t I wait to be drafted?\r\n  Why didn’t I wait to be cheered?”\r\n\r\n“Well I’ll tell the world that you deserve the credit!”\r\n\r\nAnyway Company A has settled one point: if they ever march up Fifth\r\nAvenue I am to march with them.\r\n\r\n\r\nBourmont, January 11.\r\n\r\nThe “convicts” are out of quarantine, and none the worse it seems for\r\nthe experience. Yet my family is still depleted. Forty boys from the\r\ncompany have been sent out on a wood-chopping detail. Detachments from\r\neach of the four companies in rotation are being sent out into the\r\nforest to cut fuel for the use of the First Battalion and now it is our\r\nturn.\r\n\r\nThe boys, we learn, are billeted in a twelfth century fortress in a tiny\r\nvillage at the forest’s edge. From time to time some of them hike the\r\nfour miles in to Saint Thiebault after the day’s work is done, in order\r\nto get a cup of hot chocolate and to tease a candle out of me. For the\r\nchateau boasts none of the modern luxuries of heat and light.\r\n\r\n“What do you do in the evenings?” I asked Mr. Gatts.\r\n\r\n“Sit in the _café_. It’s the only place there is to go.”\r\n\r\n“I’m sorry.”\r\n\r\n“Well you needn’t worry about the boys drinkin’. They ain’t none of them\r\ngot no money. All they can do is to sit and watch the Frenchies.”\r\n\r\nIndeed such a long time has passed since our last payday that the whole\r\ncompany is feeling the pinch of poverty. Canteen sales have narrowed\r\ndown to the three essentials; chocolate, cigarettes and chewing gum. I\r\nam running accounts on my personal responsibility, giving them “jawbone”\r\nas the boys say, a proceeding at which our Secretary looks with a\r\ndisapproving eye. To be sure the air is full of rumours of impending\r\npayday but meanwhile there is no disguising the fact that the great\r\nmajority is “dead broke.”\r\n\r\nSays Sergeant X to Sergeant Z, a boy with a curious cast of countenance;\r\n“Say, Bill, do you remember the time I paid ten cents to see you in a\r\ncage at Barnum’s? Well I want that dime back now.”\r\n\r\nAnother lad in answer to the appeal of “got a cent?” replies with\r\nfeeling; “One cent? Why man, if I had a cent I’d go to Paris!”\r\n\r\nThey have court-martialed the lieutenant who beat Malotzzi. His\r\npunishment is to be transferred to another regiment.\r\n\r\n\r\nBourmont, January 14.\r\n\r\nMadame is sick and I am worried. It isn’t so much that she is\r\ndangerously ill as that she is dangerously old. She lies in the big blue\r\nroom upstairs, looking like a patient aged Madonna, without a fire, and\r\nwith no one to look after her. Monsieur it seems has made up his mind to\r\nher demise and piously resigned himself. I called in an army doctor.\r\n\r\n“She’s pretty low,” he said, “but it isn’t medicine she needs so much as\r\nnursing.”\r\n\r\nI informed Monsieur. He must get a woman to come in and take care of\r\nher. But there was no such woman. He must try to find one. But no, it\r\nwas impossible! “Well at least, you can make a fire in her room,” I told\r\nhim. As for _La Petite_, she has proved herself a broken reed. Lacking\r\nMadame’s rigid eyes upon her, she has become lazy and negligent.\r\nMoreover she is indubitably in love with some doughty doughboy, the\r\nproof being that she spends the time when she should be gathering the\r\nharvest of dust from the _Salle des Assiettes_ in copying English\r\nphrases from our books on to the Gendarme’s pink blotting-paper.\r\nYesterday we found “Welcome Americans” scrawled all over it. Meanwhile\r\nMonsieur seems to consider himself as qualifying for a martyr’s crown\r\nbecause he gets his own meals and washes his own dishes. “_Mais,\r\nregardez Mademoiselle!_” he calls to me as I pass through the\r\nliving-room, and flourishes the dish-cloth at me with a tragic air. So\r\nbetween excursions to the canteen I am trying to play nurse to Madame,\r\nand a pretty poor one I make, I fear. Worse still, I must act as\r\ninterpreter for the Doctor, whose French is absolutely nil, at every\r\nvisit and since my scanty stock of French phrases hardly includes a\r\nsick-room vocabulary I am often absolutely at a loss. But we muddle\r\nthrough somehow and the Doctor gets his reward when we stop to speak to\r\nMonsieur in the front-room afterwards, for then Monsieur must bring out\r\na bottle of champagne and together they sit in front of the fire and\r\ntoast each other.\r\n\r\nYesterday the Doctor prescribed fresh eggs. I told Monsieur. But there\r\nwere none in Bourmont he declared.\r\n\r\n“Very well,” I said, “then I’ll get them.”\r\n\r\nI started out to search. I knew of course that eggs in France these days\r\nwere difficult. In some places the Americans have been forbidden, on\r\naccount of the scarcity, to buy either eggs or chickens; a ruling which\r\nofficers have been known to evade by the simple expedient of renting\r\nlaying hens. But no such prohibition exists at present in Saint\r\nThiebault. Just the other day a lad told me he had consumed twelve fried\r\neggs at one sitting.\r\n\r\n“Yes and Corporal G. ate more than I did.”\r\n\r\n“How many did he eat?”\r\n\r\n“Oh, just thirteen.”\r\n\r\n“No wonder,” I observed, “that the French talk about _la famine_!” I\r\nstarted a house-to-house canvas of Saint Thiebault only to be met by a\r\nshake of the head and “_Pas des oeufs_” everywhere I went. Finally back\r\nat the canteen I put the question in despair to the boys. “Have you been\r\nto the tobacco shop?” they inquired. So to the tobacco shop I hurried\r\nand sure enough there they were, all one wanted at the rate of seven\r\nfrancs a dozen.\r\n\r\nLast night Madame had an egg-nogg and this morning an omelette. Now the\r\nDoctor says that she is better.\r\n\r\n\r\nBourmont, January 17.\r\n\r\nIf my fairy god-mother should lend me her magic wand, the very first\r\nthing I would wish for would be a dinner, a real dinner just like Mother\r\nused to cook, for Company A. It would start with turkey and cranberry\r\nsauce and end with several kinds of pie, ice-cream and chocolate layer\r\ncake. There would be no soup on the menu. Such a meal I am sure would do\r\nmore to raise the morale of Company A than the news of a smashing allied\r\nvictory. It is the everlasting sameness, the perpetual reiteration of a\r\ncertain few articles of food, I suppose, that makes the boys’ “chow” so\r\ndepressing.\r\n\r\n“I’ve eaten so much bacon since I’ve been in the army,” remarked one boy\r\nmournfully,” that I’m ashamed to look a pig in the face.”\r\n\r\nThere is one question which the whole A. E. F. would like to have\r\nanswered. They’ve “got the bacon,” but what became of the ham?\r\n\r\nFar more hated than the bacon, however, is the “slum,” a word which Pat\r\ninforms me is derived from the “slumgullion” of the hobo. It is this\r\n“slum” that gives the doughboy his horror of anything like soup.\r\n\r\n“When I get back to New York,” said a lad to me the other day, “I’m\r\ngoing to go into a real swell hotel and order a big dish o’ slum. Then\r\nI’m going to order a regular dinner, beefsteak and oysters and all the\r\nfixings, and then I’m going to sit and laugh at the slum.”\r\n\r\nPat came in with a whoop after dinner yesterday. “We had a change\r\ntoday,” he sang out, “they put a pickle in the beans!” This noon he\r\nbounced in again. “We had a change today,” he shouted, “they cut the\r\nbeans lengthwise instead of cuttin’ them acrosst.”\r\n\r\nI made a fatal error. “Don’t you like beans?” I asked. “Why I’m very\r\nfond of them. I wish they’d give them to us at our mess once in a\r\nwhile.”\r\n\r\nPat looked at me with his sharp eyes narrowing. “D’you mean it?”\r\n\r\n“Why of course I do!”\r\n\r\nHe turned and walked out of the hut. Two minutes later he returned with\r\na hunk of bread and a mess-kit brimfull of beans; he laid them on the\r\ncounter in front of me. I gasped but did my best to rise to the\r\noccasion. I was delighted to see those beans, I assured him. I had just\r\nbeen starting out to go to mess; a little bird had told me they were to\r\nhave roast pork, French fries, and peach pie for dinner, but now I would\r\nstay at the hut and eat beans instead. Then I tasted the beans. They\r\nwere as hard as bullets, they stuck in my throat; I had never known\r\nanything could be quite so awful. But Pat’s eyes were upon me. There was\r\nnothing for it but to swallow those beans. So swallow them I did, every\r\nlast one, and there were positively at least a thousand. Then I washed\r\nthe mess-kit and returned it to friend Pat with effusive thanks. At\r\nleast, I complimented myself, I had been game. Tonight, just as I was\r\nstarting out for my supper of toast and chocolate with the little old\r\nladies of the Rue Dieu, Pat suddenly appeared on the other side of the\r\ncounter.\r\n\r\n“We had ’em again tonight,” he announced joyfully, “and I thought since\r\nyou were so fond of ’em,”—he pushed another mess-kit full of beans\r\nacross the counter. I glared at him. I had vainly been trying to recover\r\nfrom the dinner beans all afternoon.\r\n\r\n“Take those things away,” I snapped, “I don’t want to lay eyes on\r\nanother bean as long as ever I live!” Pat had called my bluff.\r\n\r\nFor the last week Company A has had guests in the mess-hall. Several\r\nFrench soldiers have been sent here to instruct the boys in some special\r\ndrill; it was arranged that they eat and sleep with the Americans.\r\nDreary as the boys find their chow, it proved a treat to the poilus who\r\nevidently spread the news of their good fortune among their friends in\r\nthe vicinity, for day by day the number of Frenchmen messing with\r\nCompany A was mysteriously increased.\r\n\r\n“Yes sir!” the indignant Mess Sergeant declared to me. “They started in\r\nwith five and now they’ve grown to be fifteen. I can’t tell one from\r\nt’other because all these frogs look alike to me, and they know as how I\r\ncan’t sling their lingo. That’s a nice thing for them to be putting over\r\non me!”\r\n\r\nBut yesterday he got his chance to get even. He caught one of the\r\nFrenchmen putting a piece of bread in his pocket. It is of course a\r\nmilitary offense to carry food out of the mess-hall.\r\n\r\n“I just sailed right into that guy”—the Mess Sergeant is a large and\r\nhusky specimen—“and I sure did wipe up the floor some with him. And\r\nsince then the whole gang of ’em has been scared stiff. Those frogs just\r\nwatch me all the time. There ain’t a minute when I’m in the mess-hall\r\nthat one of ’em takes his eyes off me.”\r\n\r\nThe other day, they tell me, one of the boys in the company, possessed\r\nof a practical turn, employed his newly-issued “tin derby” as a kettle\r\nin which to boil some eggs. The delicacy proved dear. Betrayed by the\r\nblackened helmet, he was tried and fined twenty dollars.\r\n\r\n\r\nBourmont, January 20.\r\n\r\nI’m off for Paris! My eyes have been in a horrid state for the last\r\nweek. I have had all the doctors in the neighborhood treating them and\r\nthey only get worse and worse. The Chief is going up to Paris tomorrow\r\nand has decided that the best thing to do is to take me along to see a\r\nspecialist.\r\n\r\nMadame is so much better that I don’t feel uneasy at leaving her. But I\r\nhate to desert the boys, especially as the hut is in such a state.\r\nYesterday we had a storm and the wind almost wrecked our tent. There was\r\none moment while I was out at dinner, when such a gust hit it, that, as\r\nthe boys said, “She sure seemed a goner.” At that moment there was a\r\nstampede for the door, the boys shooting out of the tent “just like\r\nseeds from an orange when you squeeze it.” But thanks to the Secretary\r\nand a crowd of boys who got out and hung for dear life on to the guy\r\nropes, the tent came through damaged but still standing. When I returned\r\nafter mess I found our hut with two great gaping rents torn in the outer\r\nwalls and the inner lining all ripped loose and hanging down from the\r\nceiling, so that one felt exactly as if one were inside a punctured\r\nzeppelin.\r\n\r\nReports coming in this morning from other points on the division state\r\nthat two tents actually did collapse during the tempest, and that one\r\nman, caught beneath the wreckage, had his collarbone broken. So we can\r\ncount ourselves lucky.\r\n\r\nTonight I said _au ’voir_ to Company A, telling them that if payday\r\nshould occur during my absence, I hoped they all would be very, very\r\ngood. Some of the boys lugubriously predicted that I would never return,\r\nwhile others darkly insinuated that they suspected I was “goin’ to Paris\r\nto git married.” To show them what my intentions honestly were, I\r\ninquired if there were any errands I could do for them in the city.\r\nCorporal G. looked at me, stammered, hesitated. There was something he\r\nwould like, only he didn’t want to bother me. What was it? He paused,\r\ngrew red, then blurted it out.\r\n\r\n“If it ain’t too much trouble, could you send me a picture post-card\r\nwhile you’re away? I ain’t never had a post-card from Paris.”\r\n\r\n\r\nHôpital Claude-Bernard, Porte D’Aubervilliers\r\n\r\nParis, January 25.\r\n\r\nThis is a hideous hospital. They wake you up in the middle of the night\r\nto wrap you in a mustard poultice. They wake you up in the wee sma’\r\nhours and order you to brush your teeth. And nobody in the whole\r\nestablishment from head-doctor to scrub-lady knows a word of English;\r\nexcept the night-nurse and she knows “mumpsss!” like that she says it,\r\n“MUMPSSSSS!” Not that I have them; I have the measles. I don’t know\r\nwhere I got them. They were, so far as I am aware, almost the only known\r\nmalady which we didn’t have at Bourmont. Probably some lad who was\r\npassing through the town and stopped in at the canteen gave them to me.\r\nIt was undoubtedly the measles that were affecting my eyes; sometimes it\r\nseems they act that way.\r\n\r\nThey sent me to this hospital because it was the only hospital in Paris\r\nadmitting women that had room for me: known officially as the city\r\nhospital for contagious diseases, among Americans it passes as “the\r\npest-house.”\r\n\r\nThey think I’m a weird one here, because I want my window open.\r\nTwenty-nine times a day at least an _infirmière_ will come hurrying in\r\nand bang it shut and twenty-nine times a day I crawl out of bed and open\r\nit again.\r\n\r\nThe nursing here is all done by _infirmières_, or untrained women under\r\nthe direction of two real nurses, one in charge of this wing during the\r\nday, the other during the night. Some of these _infirmières_ go about in\r\ncurl papers, others wear sabots. They mean well enough, but they are\r\noverworked, and frankly peasant types, with little education and almost\r\nno notion of cleanliness or of much else that is supposed to pertain to\r\nnursing. Last night a fat old soul without many teeth came waddling into\r\nmy room to have a look at that interesting curiosity, _la pauvre petite\r\nDame Américaine_. When she saw my open window she was so overcome with\r\nastonishment that she hurried out and fetched a companion to regard the\r\nphenomenon. The two of them stood and stared at it and discussed the\r\nmatter between themselves for quite a while, then the fat one turned to\r\nme and remarked with a toothless but engaging smile; it was very warm in\r\nAmerica where I lived, was it not? When I replied that, instead, it was\r\nmuch colder in winter there than here in Paris, they looked aghast and\r\nflatly incredulous. Their only explanation of the matter had been, it\r\nseemed, that I was accustomed to living in the tropics and just didn’t\r\nhave sense enough to suit my habits to the atmosphere.\r\n\r\nJust outside the hospital there is a munitions factory. At night the\r\nlight over the front door shines into my room and day and night the\r\nmachinery keeps up an incessant thudding hum that says as plain as words\r\nover and over and over: _Kill the Boches. Kill the Boches. Kill the\r\nBoches._ Once in a long while the machines stop for a few moments in\r\norder, I suppose, to catch their breath and then I grow dreadfully\r\nworried, for I know that if someone doesn’t keep on killing the Boches\r\nevery second, they will be breaking through the lines and pouring in\r\nover France in great drowning grey waves.\r\n\r\nJanuary 27. I haven’t got the measles after all; I have the German\r\nmeasles, only they don’t call it that in French I am glad to say. At\r\nfirst I was so very red and speckled that they thought I had the\r\n_rougeole_, but now they have decided it is only the _rubeole_ after\r\nall. A concourse of doctors considered me yesterday morning and\r\npronounced the verdict. “But then,” I demanded, “if it’s only the\r\n_rubeole_ can’t I be leaving _tout de suite_?” For the French do not\r\nconsider quarantine necessary for the rubeole. “Eight days,” they\r\nanswered, and when I expostulated they turned on their collective heels\r\nand marched callously out the door, each one holding up eight fingers\r\napiece as a parting rejoinder.\r\n\r\nLast night I resisted a great temptation. This place is full of doors\r\nwith little glass panes in them. As I lay awake in bed in the middle of\r\nthe night, a wild desire grew on me to seize my big green bottle of\r\nmineral water by the neck and see how many panes of glass I could\r\naccount for before they nabbed me. I had a perfect vision of myself,\r\nflying down the hall in my little flour-sack chemise of a night-gown,\r\nlong legs stretching out beneath, going zip, bang, right and left into\r\nthose window panes. I have seldom wanted to do anything quite so badly.\r\nAnd then just to top off with I was going to wring the interne’s neck.\r\nHe is a little shrimp of a man—that interne, with no chin and a sort of\r\nscrawny picked-chicken neck, a neck that gets on one’s nerves.\r\n\r\nWhen they sent me to this hospital I comforted myself with the thought\r\nthat I would at least learn a little French while staying here, but the\r\nonly thing I have learned so far is that _gargariser_ means gargle and\r\nany goose might have guessed that.\r\n\r\n                    *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nJanuary 28. The Chief has sent me a rose-pink cyclamen. It is a lovely\r\nthing and very elaborately done up with pink crêpe paper and a large bow\r\nof shell-pink ribbon. Now I am no longer an object of any interest.\r\nEvery last doctor, nurse, interne and _infirmière_ who comes into my\r\nroom to take a look at _la petite Mees_, immediately turns his or her\r\nback on me and admires the cyclamen instead. I gather such objects are\r\nrare in French hospitals, for they examine and discuss it at the\r\ngreatest length, always winding up with the remark that it must have\r\n“cost very dear.”\r\n\r\nNot having anything else to do I lie with my eyes shut and think. And of\r\ncourse I have been thinking chiefly about Company A. I have thought\r\namong other things of a play, or rather a dramatic charade in three\r\nacts, which we might give in the hut. It is to be entitled _Slum_. In\r\nthe first act,—_Bill_— three doughboys hit on a plan to encompass the\r\nKaiser’s death and so become rich by gaining the proffered reward:—they\r\nwill send him a dish of slum! The second act,—_et_—shows a room in the\r\nPotsdam palace with Kaiser Bill and His Side Whiskers, the Lord High\r\nChancellor, discussing the food situation. The slum appears; the Kaiser\r\npartakes of it and falls writhing to the floor. The last act shows a\r\ntypical barn-loft billet, with rats squeaking, chickens clucking et\r\ncetera, where the Soldiers Three of the first act have their lodging.\r\nThey receive the tidings of the Kaiser’s death; wild rejoicings ensue,\r\nas in fancy they spend their fortunes; only to be cut short by the\r\ndiscovery that the cook who made the slum has already claimed the\r\nreward. I think we can stage it successfully, though the costumes for\r\nthe Kaiser and His Side Whiskers present some difficulties. One thing\r\nonly troubles me; will it hurt the Mess Sergeant’s feelings?\r\n\r\n                    *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nJanuary 30. They have relented. They have shortened my stay. I am to be\r\nlet out tomorrow, but I must _reposer_ a few days before going back to\r\nwork. Bother! I haven’t heard anything from Bourmont for ten days and I\r\nam full of uneasy apprehensions. Since I have been in the hospital the\r\ncyclamen has been the only word I have had from the outside world. I\r\nhave been cut off as completely as if I were in a tomb. Ah well, some\r\nday I’ll get back to the hut again I suppose, and when I do, if those\r\nboys aren’t almost half as glad to see me as I am to see them, why I’ll\r\nknow that some other canteen lady has been surreptitiously stealing\r\ntheir affections, and I shall put poison in her soup.\r\n\r\n\r\nHôpital Claude-Bernard\r\n\r\nParis, January 31.\r\n\r\nI have been in a big air raid; this is just how it all happened:\r\n\r\nIt was a white night in the hospital for me. I had lain for hours, it\r\nseemed, in the little blue room watching through the glass panes of my\r\ndoor the coiffed head of a young _infirmière_ bent over her embroidery.\r\nShe sat outside my door because there was a light in the hall just\r\nthere. Suddenly my drowsy ears were pierced by a long weird hoot. In an\r\ninstant the girl had leaped to her feet and switched off the light, then\r\nshe turned and ran down the hall. A moment later and the building was in\r\ndarkness. I jumped from my bed and ran to the window. The light in front\r\nof the munitions factory was out, there seemed an uncanny silence, the\r\nmachinery had been stopped. I hurried to the door. The corridor was full\r\nof hastening forms, _infirmières_, their loose white robes showing dimly\r\nin the grey light.\r\n\r\n“_Qu’est ce qui arrive?_” I demanded.\r\n\r\n“_Les Boches!_”\r\n\r\nThe night nurse was peering from my window.\r\n\r\n“It’s the first warning,” she whispered. “See! the lights of Paris still\r\nshine.”\r\n\r\nBut even as we looked, the light across the sky that was Paris\r\nflickered, dimmed, flashed out. At the same moment two great golden\r\nstars rose over the munitions factory.\r\n\r\n“_Les avions!_” cried the night nurse.\r\n\r\nAnd all the time the sirens kept up their ghostly wailing, like nothing\r\none could imagine except a vast host of lost souls. Then the guns began.\r\nA moment later a crashing thud told that a bomb had fallen in our\r\nneighborhood. The night nurse drew me hurriedly into the hall.\r\n\r\n“Lie down against the wall,—close—like this,” she ordered.\r\n\r\nUp and down the corridor every space by the wall was occupied by the\r\nhuddled form of an _infirmière_ buried beneath a mattress. The night\r\nnurse, who had a whole heap of mattresses to herself, pushed one across\r\nto me. I lay on the top, finding it more comfortable that way.\r\n\r\nThe bombs were falling nearer. A child in one of the wards woke up and\r\nbegan to wail fretfully. No one heeded her. There was a flash and then a\r\ntearing thud that shook the hospital. I had one ghastly moment, a thrill\r\nof panic terror at our utter helplessness as we lay there awaiting what\r\nseemed the inevitable coming of destruction. The moment passed. I got up\r\nand slipped down the side corridor to the glass door. The sky was full\r\nof moving lights; some burned with a steady brilliancy, some flickered\r\nand went out like fireflies, a few flashed red. There was no telling\r\nwhich was friend or foe. They seemed to be proceeding in all directions\r\nwithout plan or purpose. The air pulsated with the humming drone of\r\ntheir motors. They were like a swarm of angry hornets I thought. Across\r\nthe road, standing on the top of a high wall, in sharp silhouette\r\nagainst the sky, three poilus stood to watch. Every now and then an\r\n_infirmière_, curiosity outweighing caution, would leave her\r\nhiding-place and creep to the door beside me only to burrow like a bug,\r\na moment later, underneath her mattress once more.\r\n\r\n“_Mees! N’avez-vous pas peur?_”\r\n\r\n“_Mais non!_”\r\n\r\n“_Ah, vous êtes un soldat!_”\r\n\r\nI went back to my room and climbed out on the window-sill. At first I\r\nthought the lights of Paris had been turned on again, but this time they\r\nwere color of rose. As I looked the pink flush deepened, grew ruddy,\r\nflamed across the sky. I called the night nurse.\r\n\r\n“_C’est une incendie_,” she wailed staccato. “_Quel malheur!_”\r\n\r\nSo Paris was on fire.\r\n\r\nAs we watched two big puffs of white smoke rose over the munitions\r\nfactory, spread into a cloud, drifted slowly toward us. The night nurse\r\nsniffed, then shut the window hurriedly.\r\n\r\n“_La gaz_,” she whispered. I questioned it but left the window shut.\r\n\r\nAn aeroplane swung low over the munitions factory, so near that it\r\nlooked like a great lazy fish with the rose light from below shining on\r\nits belly. Was it friend or enemy?\r\n\r\nThe bombs were dropping close again. One could see the flashes and feel\r\nthe jar of the explosions which made the windows rattle.\r\n\r\n“_Oh les sales Boches!_”\r\n\r\n“_Oh la la!_”\r\n\r\nThe agonized wails sounded half stifled from beneath the mattresses.\r\n\r\n“_Taisez! Écoutez!_” It was the night nurse’s voice.\r\n\r\nThe front door slammed. A fat _infirmière_ in a badly shattered state of\r\nnerves stumbled down the hall weeping out unintelligible woes. At my\r\nmattress she came to a standstill, then ducked and tried to crawl\r\nbeneath it; failing, she sat down on top of me. I ventured a polite\r\nprotest,—in vain. The night nurse heard me. She emerged from beneath her\r\nheap. Followed a scene dramatic, unforgettable. Mattresses scattered to\r\neach side of her, heedless of the falling bombs, with Gallic passion she\r\nproceeded to point out to the sobbing _infirmière_ the shortcomings of\r\nher behaviour. But the fat lady proved unrepentant, her terror at the\r\nbombs superseding even her awe of the night nurse. She sat tight,\r\nholding her ground. She even ventured to answer back. The scene grew\r\nmore intense. After I had heard the night nurse discharge the\r\n_infirmière_ some six times over, feeling a trifle out of place, I\r\nmanaged to crawl from beneath and made my way back to the window. No\r\nmore bombs were falling but the guns still barked. As I watched, a\r\nburning plane looking like a great tinsel ball seared its way through\r\nthe sky, falling just to the right of Paris.\r\n\r\n“Pray God it is a Boche!” I thought.\r\n\r\nA round-eyed _infirmière_ peered in at the door, staring curiously at\r\nme.\r\n\r\n“_Mees! Vous allez retourner en Amerique?_”\r\n\r\n“_Mais oui! A près la guerre!_”\r\n\r\nThe red glare over Paris was fading out. The machines in the munitions\r\nfactory began to throb once more. In the grey light at the window I\r\nlooked at my watch. It was fifteen minutes past one. I turned to crawl\r\ninto bed feeling cold and very sleepy. Some one touched my sleeve; it\r\nwas the night nurse. She was staring out the window with eyes that saw\r\nnothing.\r\n\r\n“And how many little children will be dead in the morning do you think?”\r\nshe asked.\r\n\r\n\r\nBourmont, February 5.\r\n\r\nThe blow that I somehow dimly apprehended while I was in the hospital\r\nhas fallen. Last night late I arrived from Paris. The first thing I\r\nlearned was, that with the addition of some new workers a general\r\nshuffle of the women at Headquarters was to take place. This morning the\r\nChief called us together and gave us our new assignments. The Gendarme\r\nand I are to leave Bourmont. Since I have been away regimental\r\nHeadquarters have been moved from Saint Thiebault to Goncourt, a town\r\nabout two miles to the south, and the whole regiment with the exception\r\nof the First Battalion concentrated there. The Y. at Goncourt has had a\r\nhard time of it. Originally it occupied a barracks; then the regimental\r\nmachine-gun company moved in and the Y. must move out. So the Y. settled\r\nitself in an old stone mill by the Meuse, only to have the military\r\nauthorities decide that they needed that mill for a guard-house. So once\r\nmore the Y. moved, this time to a little old house in the centre of the\r\nvillage; and here according to last reports it still is, for the simple\r\nreason that nobody else has any use for the little old house. Meanwhile,\r\nhowever, they are putting up a Big Hut which is to be ready in from one\r\nto three weeks, all according to who is making the estimate. It is to\r\nGoncourt that the Gendarme and I have been assigned. According to the\r\nChief this is a “promotion.”\r\n\r\n“It’s the largest, the most important place on the division now,” he\r\ndeclared; “I’m sending you there because you made good at Saint\r\nThiebault.”\r\n\r\nBut this little piece of taffy doesn’t seem to help matters a bit. The\r\nonly way to look at it is that it’s a case of the greatest good for the\r\ngreatest number, and of course numerically Goncourt is about ten times\r\nas important as Saint Thiebault. And anyway it wouldn’t do the least\r\ngood to kick against the pricks because when all is said and done one is\r\nunder orders like a soldier. After all it isn’t as if I were going to\r\nGreenland or to Timbuctoo. And yet at even only two miles distance, so\r\ntied to the work one must be, one might almost as well be in a different\r\nplanet.\r\n\r\nAs for Saint Thiebault, they are going to have to do with just a man\r\nsecretary there. The place is too small, the Chief says, to be allowed\r\nmore than one worker.\r\n\r\nWe won’t be moving for several days yet. I’m not going to say a word\r\nabout it to Company A until the very last moment. I hate partings.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II: GONCOURT—THE DOUGHBOYS\r\n\r\n\r\nGoncourt, February 11.\r\n\r\nThe little old house which now harbors the Y. formerly served, it seems,\r\nas guard-house. To some it must have a strangely familiar air.\r\nDownstairs there are two small rooms; the front one stone-paved, with a\r\ndark carved cupboard in one corner which formerly enclosed the family\r\nbed, and a huge fireplace; the back one with a dirt floor over which\r\nuncertain boards have shakily been laid. The front room we use for the\r\ncanteen, the back, with four rough tables, serves as a make-shift\r\nwriting room. The walls are dim with smoke and grime, the windows in\r\nboth rooms lack half their panes, yet the odd little place has an\r\natmosphere, a charm all its own. Upstairs soldiers are billeted. When\r\nthe din of business dies down in the canteen, one can hear the crisp\r\nrattle of dice as the boys shoot craps on the floor overhead.\r\n\r\nIn accordance with military regulations here we cannot open the canteen\r\nuntil four in the afternoon. But a large part of the morning is easily\r\nspent in cleaning out the hut and arranging the stock for the afternoon\r\nand evening onslaught. At Saint Thiebault the detail that “policed up”\r\nthe camp in the morning swept out our tent for us, but here one wields\r\none’s own broom and shovel,—for first of all one must shovel out the mud\r\nthat’s on the floor! Cleaning the canteen, however, I find, though a\r\ndirty, is quite a remunerative job, for in the heaps of litter on the\r\nfloor money lurks. According to the ethics of the game if money is found\r\nback of the counter it belongs in the till, but if in front it goes to\r\nthe finder. Sometimes the find is five centimes, sometimes fifty and\r\nonce it was five francs! The litter—chocolate wrappers, orange peels and\r\ncigarette boxes—is all swept into the fireplace and then touched off\r\nwith a match; a regular bonfire ensues. This morning we had left the\r\nfront door open; immediately the fire was started a throng of villagers\r\ncrowded around to look in. They were scandalized at the conflagration.\r\nThe house was old, they cried; we would set the chimney on fire, we\r\nwould burn up the building, we would burn down the whole town! One\r\nancient and portly dame in a frenzy of protest dashed into the room and\r\nfairly danced about the hearth, shaking her apron at the flames and\r\ncalling for ashes to cover them. But before she could get her ashes the\r\nfire died down and the excitement with it.\r\n\r\nThe Gendarme and I are billeted in a tiny house just at the village\r\nedge. Our low second story looks down upon the street, so narrow that it\r\nseems one could almost reach out and touch hands with the houses\r\nopposite. But what a street it is! Underneath our low window the whole\r\nworld goes by; American officers on horseback, French officers in\r\nlimousines, American mule teams, French wood teams with three white\r\nhorses harnessed one in front of the other, and always the troops; going\r\nby at dawn in the semi-darkness, their rhythmic incessant tramp weaving\r\nitself into one’s waking dreams, passing by at noon, swinging back down\r\nthe hill as it grows dusk, singing snatches of song as they tramp. As I\r\nlie a-bed in the morning before getting up to peer out the window into\r\nthe yellow misty atmosphere I can always calculate the exact state of\r\nthe weather by the amount of squelch which those marching boots make in\r\nthe muddy road.\r\n\r\nCompany H is billeted on this same street with us. The first morning\r\nafter we arrived the Gendarme and I were startled out of sleep by First\r\nCall blown directly underneath our window. Hardly had the last note\r\nsounded when a shout fit to wake the dead went up.\r\n\r\n“Get to hell up, all of you! Rise and shine!”\r\n\r\nFollowed a tremendous banging and kicking at all the stable doors along\r\nthe street accompanied by a torrent of vivid and spicy admonitions. The\r\nGendarme and I gasped and chuckled. This was rich. Were we always to be\r\nawakened in so picturesque a fashion? But the next morning we listened\r\nin vain. First Call was blown at the far end of the street and followed\r\nby a solemn silence; and so it has been ever since. Now that American\r\nladies are known to be living on the street Company H must get up\r\ndecorously.\r\n\r\n\r\nGoncourt, February 12.\r\n\r\nThe fireplace is easily the feature of our funny little hut. Around this\r\nat night the lads crowd perched on packing-boxes to smoke, chew gum and\r\ngossip. As the first mad rush of business at the canteen dies down a\r\nlittle I edge up towards the fireplace in order to get a wee share in\r\nthe conversation.\r\n\r\nThey have caught a spy! One of the cooks in F Company. He was a deserter\r\nfrom the German Army some one said. They caught him putting dope in the\r\nslum. The doctors were analyzing it now. It’s a wonder the whole company\r\nwasn’t poisoned. Yes, and they found plans of the camp in his pocket\r\ntoo. He hasn’t eaten a thing since they arrested him. All he does is\r\njust to walk up and down the guard-house. Seems as if he were kind of\r\ncrazy.\r\n\r\nAnd so they gossip. A sad-eyed bugler remarks to me that he’d be a rich\r\nman if he only had all the hob-nailed shoes that had been thrown at him.\r\nAnother boy wonders what he’d do if he had “both arms shot off and then\r\nthe gas alarm sounded.” And always they must be rowing about their\r\nrespective states.\r\n\r\n“Neebraska! Where’s Neebraska? Is that in the United States or Canada?”\r\n\r\n“Noo Hampshire! Huh! There ain’t nothin’ but mountains there. Why my old\r\nman told me that when they let the cows out to grass there they had to\r\nput stilts on one side of ’em so they won’t fall off’n the pasture.”\r\n\r\nThen they turn on me.\r\n\r\n“Boston! When you get ten miles from Boston you can smell the beans\r\nbakin’.”\r\n\r\n“But I don’t come from Boston,” I protest.\r\n\r\n“Well there ain’t nothin’ much in Massachusetts outsider Boston. Why the\r\nstate of Noo Hampshire is goin’ to rent the rest o’ Massachusetts for a\r\nduck-yard.”\r\n\r\nAnd so it goes.\r\n\r\n“Gee! but it’s good to get into one shop where you don’t have to talk\r\nfrog talk!” exclaimed one lad tonight.\r\n\r\n“I’ve just heard the greatest compliment for you,” another lad declares\r\nsolemnly, “the greatest compliment that could possibly be paid any\r\nwoman.”\r\n\r\n“Why, what was it?”\r\n\r\n“I just heard a feller say; ‘My! don’t she look different from the\r\nFrench girls!’”\r\n\r\nA flushed-faced lad leans over my end of the counter;\r\n\r\n“You know to talk to an American girl like this again, it’s like, it’s\r\nlike—”\r\n\r\nAgain and again he tries only to become helplessly inarticulate. Then\r\npulling a large bunch of letters “from lady friends” from his pocket,\r\nnothing will do but he must tell me about each one. Finally in a fit of\r\nprodigal generosity he bestows a handful on me, “Because I’m an American\r\nand you’re one too.” As he makes the presentation something falls to the\r\nfloor with a little click. We search among the litter on the floor, the\r\nlad on all fours; finally the lost is found,—a broken bit of comb about\r\ntwo inches and a quarter long. This is a happy chance, he explains, for\r\nhe is company barber and with the company comb gone E Company would be\r\nout of luck.\r\n\r\nAlways our presence here is something that seems so strange to them as\r\nto be almost incredible.\r\n\r\n“Will you please tell me,” asked a serious-looking lad tonight, “what\r\nconsideration could possibly induce two American girls to come to a\r\nplace like this?”\r\n\r\nContinually I am encountering boys who are sure that they’ve “seen me\r\nsomewhere.”\r\n\r\n“Say, didn’t you use to live in Milwaukee?”\r\n\r\n“Haven’t I seen you in Seattle? Well, if it warn’t you, it was somebody\r\nthat looked just like you!”\r\n\r\nI suppose it is simply because I look American that I look familiar to\r\nthem. But the facts in the case seem to be that I have been observed by\r\nsome member of the A. E. F. in practically every one of the large cities\r\nof the U. S. A. One boy nearly started a fight in camp the other night\r\nby declaring that in spite of the evidence of my nose he knew I was of\r\nHebraic origin. He had seen me, he solemnly insisted, “goin’ with a Jew\r\nfeller in Philadelphia.”\r\n\r\nUndoubtedly it is because they have so little to think about in these\r\ndrab days that they are so pathetically curious. Every little thing you\r\nsay or do is repeated, discussed all over camp. Sometimes curiosity gets\r\nhold of one of the bolder spirits to such an extent that he ventures the\r\nquestion;\r\n\r\n“How much do you get paid for smiling at the soldiers?”\r\n\r\nAnd when they learn that you are a volunteer and are paying for the\r\nprivilege of being there, their amazement is so blank as to be\r\npositively ludicrous.\r\n\r\n\r\nGoncourt, February 13.\r\n\r\nOne of the nicest things about Goncourt is our mess. This we have at the\r\nHouse Across the Street, which is next to the House of the Madonna. We\r\nmess _en famille_ with the family Peirut, the Gendarme, Mr. K. and I,\r\nand we eat the family fare which consists chiefly of soup, boiled meat\r\nand carrots, supplemented by various additions such as sugar, cocoa, jam\r\nand canned corn from the commissary. I can never quite decide which is\r\nquainter, the family or the setting.\r\n\r\nIn America we have the phrase _living-room_, in France they have it. In\r\nthis one high-ceilinged room the daily life of the family is complete.\r\nHere is the kitchen stove and the dinner table, here are the beds of\r\nMadame and Monsieur, Madame’s in one corner hung with dim flowered\r\nchintz, Monsieur’s in another brave with a beautiful old red India\r\nshawl. Here is the broad stone sink under the window, with the drain\r\nrunning out into the street, where the family makes its morning toilet.\r\nHere are the great dark armoires which hold clothing, china-ware and\r\nstores of all sorts. Here is the littered desk where the family\r\ncorrespondence is carried on; and here is the larder, a huge slab of\r\npork and a ham hanging from the beams over one’s head, while on a stick\r\nin front of the fireplace a row of little fishes hang by their tails in\r\ndumb expectation of a Friday. And here too is the family shrine, a\r\nlittle wooden Madonna in red and blue, found as Madame tells us in the\r\nancient city of La Mothe, which, destroyed in 1645, now exists as a\r\nwonderful ruin crowning a hill some two miles to the west.\r\n\r\nIf the stove-wood is found lacking at meal-time, Monsieur rises from his\r\nchair and saws an armful beside the dinner-table. If Madame decides\r\nwhile we are eating our soup that a piece of ham will improve the menu\r\nshe stands upon her chair and cuts a slice in the air over our heads. On\r\nwash days one picks one’s way to the table past the pails which hold the\r\nfamily linen in soak, and later eats one’s soupe _à pain_ under a brave\r\narray of drying garments slung from wall to wall.\r\n\r\nThe family, which consists of Monsieur, Madame and Mademoielle, the two\r\nsons being in service, are the most hospitable souls alive. Continually\r\nthey urge, “_Mangez, mangez!_” and then, “_Vous êtes timide!_” Their\r\nfeelings are dreadfully hurt if each one of us refuses to eat enough for\r\ntwo. They seem somehow to have acquired the idea that Americans need a\r\nvast deal of sweetening, so they offer you sugar, commissary sugar, with\r\neverything, and they are gently but definitely disappointed when you\r\ndecline to heap it on your mashed potato.\r\n\r\nMile. Jeane, clear-skinned, bright-eyed, capable, energetic yet\r\npossessed of a warm charm withal, is forewoman of the little glove\r\nfactory in town.\r\n\r\n“Are there many employees?” I asked.\r\n\r\n“But no. Eight only. Since the Americans came to town all the women have\r\ndeserted the factory in order to wash the Americans’ clothes.”\r\n\r\nMonsieur, it appears, is a wood-cutter by profession. He comes home from\r\na hard day’s chopping looking like a genus of the woods himself with his\r\nworn brown velour suit, his wrinkled brown skin and his ragged brown\r\nbeard which resembles exactly those bundles of fine twigs which the\r\nFrench burn in their fireplaces. When Monsieur was ten years old the\r\nGermans occupied the town and sixteen of them slept in this very room.\r\nThey were perfect pigs, he says, and ate everything they could lay their\r\nhands on; “But,” he adds, “they didn’t like our bread!”\r\n\r\nSunday mornings all the men in town, including the Man With One Leg, and\r\nall the dogs start off together, the men armed with guns and each\r\ncarrying a musette bag or knapsack. Papa puts on his shooting coat with\r\nthe fancy buttons each depicting a different bird or beast of the chase,\r\ntakes down his old shot-gun from the wall, and joins them. At dusk they\r\ncome back again, empty-handed, but seemingly well content. Their modus\r\noperandi, I gather, is to proceed to a comfortable spot in the woods,\r\nthen all sit down, drink vin rouge and wait for the game. Indeed one\r\ndoughboy declares, that passing by one of those open alleys which\r\nintersect the forests here, he once saw an old Frenchman standing with\r\nhis gun in a drizzling rain, patiently waiting for a shot while by his\r\nside stood another “old frog” holding an umbrella over him.\r\n\r\n\r\nGoncourt, February 14.\r\n\r\nThe woman who lives in the House of the Madonna is an unconscionable old\r\nscalawag. Not that you would ever suspect it to look at her, for with\r\nher round rosy face, her smooth parted hair and her comfortably rotund\r\nfigure she resembles nothing so much as somebody’s genial and respected\r\ngrandmother. Yet the facts in the case remain. She sells doped wine to\r\nthe soldiers at ruinous prices and she sells at forbidden hours.\r\nMoreover we have reason to suspect that at odd times she carries on an\r\nutterly illicit commerce. According to our hostess, when the time from\r\nthe last pay day grows too long, certain soldiers are not above\r\nsmuggling in their extra shoes and shirts to her, and she pays them back\r\nin drinks.\r\n\r\nThis morning while I was at breakfast she came bouncing in and proceeded\r\nto fill the house with lamentations. Last night a tipsy soldier had\r\nstolen the key to her front door! Then she delved into history for my\r\nbenefit, recounting how, some weeks before, two soldiers, having sent\r\nher out of the room on an errand, had proceeded to rob her till, the sum\r\namounting to almost three hundred francs!\r\n\r\n“_Oh! Ils sont des monstres, des cochons!_” she wailed.\r\n\r\nWhereat I, with some asperity, remarked that if the French people\r\nwouldn’t sell drink to the Americans, the soldiers wouldn’t become\r\n_zig-zag_ and do such things. Immediately she became conciliatory. Of\r\ncourse, everyone knew that there were good people and bad people in\r\nevery nation, but certainly! Then she changed the subject abruptly,\r\ndemanding; why, why in the name of common sense did I do anything so\r\ncontrary to all the dictates of reason as to sleep with my window open?\r\n\r\nLast night, as Mr. K. and I were coming home from the canteen, the door\r\nof the cafe opposite was suddenly opened and a man’s figure appeared,\r\nhalf pushed, half thrown outside. The door slammed shut,—it was long\r\nafter closing hour for the cafe,—the figure fell like a log to the\r\nground. We watched a minute to see the fellow pick himself up, but he\r\nlay motionless. It was a freezing night. Mr. K. went over to\r\ninvestigate. The man was in a drunken stupor.\r\n\r\n“You go along,” he called to me, “I’ve got to get this fellow home.”\r\n\r\nI left reluctantly. Subsequently Mr. K. told me the night’s history.\r\nAfter considerable coaxing, he had finally succeeded in extracting the\r\ninformation that the boy belonged to F Company. So to F Company\r\nbarracks, a good half-mile north of the canteen, they had proceeded, Mr.\r\nK. half dragging, half carrying the fellow who was head and shoulders\r\ntaller than he, and broad to boot.\r\n\r\nWhen they had nearly reached their journey’s end, Mr. K. by this time\r\nfairly in a state of collapse, his burden suddenly baulked. The barracks\r\nevidently didn’t look like home to him. Mr. K. began to have a sickening\r\nsense of something gone wrong. At last the wretch drowsily recalled the\r\nfact that he didn’t belong to F Company at all, but to I Company far on\r\nthe other side of town. So around they turned and back through town they\r\ncrawled until finally they arrived at I Company’s abiding-place; and\r\nthis time the derelict was satisfied.\r\n\r\nIndeed a walk home from the canteen at night with Mr. K. at any time is\r\nlikely to prove an adventure. For should we meet a boy who has had more\r\nthan is “good for him” and is in an irritable mood, we must stop and\r\ntalk with him, in order, as Mr. K’s theory puts it, to divert his mind.\r\n“Get them thinking about something else,” is his slogan. The other night\r\nwe stood out in the sleety drizzle until my feet fairly froze solid into\r\nthe freezing mud, carrying on polite conversations with two boys who had\r\njust been put out of the House of the Madonna and were in a state of\r\nmind to wreck the town. One of them Mr. K. got started on the subject of\r\ntaking French lessons. He was ambitious to study French he explained and\r\nwould Mr. K. kindly arrange for a teacher and a course of lessons? I\r\nlistened with one ear; here was the first man I had found in France who\r\nexpressed an earnest desire to learn French and he was tipsy! The other\r\none, evidently ashamed, explained to me at length how he hadn’t wanted\r\nto get drunk, the trouble was that he was just naturally “dishgushted\r\nwith this country, just dishgushted.” And that it seems to me is the\r\nwhole thing in two words. The boys are “just dishgushted.” Considering\r\nit all, who can blame them?\r\n\r\n\r\nGoncourt, February 15.\r\n\r\nThe M. P.s who live in the second story of the Guard-House are my good\r\nfriends. They help sweep out the hut often in the mornings and when they\r\nmake taffy in their mess kits they bring me some. These M. P.s are in\r\nreality cavalrymen detached from their regiment for the time being in\r\norder to do police duty. As far as I can see, there seems to be no\r\nspecial hard feeling between them and the doughboys.\r\n\r\nOne slim young M. P. in particular is a crony of mine. He keeps me\r\ninformed as to the gossip of the town. He tells me how the French women\r\nwho run cafes, our neighbor of the House of the Madonna among them, seek\r\nto curry favor with the law in Goncourt, by bringing him out coffee and\r\nsandwiches as he walks his beat in the middle of the night; and how, the\r\nother night after closing hour, he put his head inside the door of one\r\nof these cafes to be greeted by a frantic shriek of “_Feenish!\r\nFeenish!_” from the hostess, only to find, when he insisted on entering,\r\na crowd of doughboys making merry in the back-room; how he took their\r\nnames and then was inspired to look at their “dog tags” in confirmation\r\nand found that not one of the names agreed! He tells me about the cross\r\nold Frenchman whose beehives have been stealthily, inexplicably,\r\ndisappearing one by one, in spite of the fact that the Frenchman had\r\ntied his unfortunate and much suffering dog underneath the hives to\r\nguard them; until now the old gentleman had taken to sitting up nights\r\nwith a shot-gun in order to watch the remaining ones. “He’s a kind o’\r\nsnoopy old man and nobody likes him. I reckon the boys are taking his\r\nbeehives just to spite him.” He tells me about the old lady who wants to\r\nmarry him to her daughter; but chiefly he tells me,—under the strictest\r\noath of secrecy,— the latest development in the case of the old woman\r\nwhom he suspects of being a spy. I advise him to hand the matter over to\r\nthe Intelligence Officer, but no, he must have the honor of catching her\r\nred-handed himself. It’s quite like reading a detective story in\r\ninstallments.\r\n\r\nThe other night while I was talking to one of the M. P.s in the canteen,\r\nwe heard a shot up the street. The next moment another M. P. appeared at\r\nthe door. After the exchange of a few whispered words, the two of them\r\nran out of the hut, and as they went, I saw them both draw their\r\nrevolvers. Fifteen minutes later the doughboys coming into the canteen\r\nbrought a ghastly tale. There had been a fight between the M. P.s and\r\nthe soldiers. The M. P.s had shot and killed two. “Yes, so-help-me-God,\r\nit’s the truth!” The narrator had himself seen the two slain doughboys\r\nlying in the street; one had been shot through the head, the other\r\nthrough the heart. So the story went around. We went to bed that night\r\nwith a dull sense of horror hanging over us.\r\n\r\nThe next morning I confronted my friend the M. P. with the story. Then I\r\nlearned the true version. He had been on his beat not far from the\r\nchurch, when down a dark alley he had heard sounds of a tremendous\r\nfracas. In spite of the fact that he didn’t have his stick with him he\r\nhad plunged down the alley to come upon “a bunch of wops beating each\r\nother over the head with beer bottles.” When they caught sight of the M.\r\nP. they had quickly abandoned their family disagreement in order to turn\r\nupon the intruder. He had shot his revolver into the air and this had\r\nbeen enough to frighten them into taking to their heels. The two fellows\r\nwho had been seen lying on the ground were the casualties resulting from\r\nthe bottle-fight: they had been stunned and gashed so badly as to bleed\r\na good deal, but were later patched up with complete success at the\r\nhospital.\r\n\r\nIndeed life at Goncourt is seldom unrelieved by incident. Last night I\r\nwas sitting by our open window reading—the Gendarme was out—after my\r\nreturn from the hut, when I heard an angry voice snarl something abusive\r\ndirectly beneath me; a moment later a fusillade began. I jumped for the\r\ncandle, blew it out, then stood close against the wall. After a minute\r\nthe shots ceased; immediately excited people began to pour into the\r\nstreet. I heard the M. P.s pounding on the door of the House Across the\r\nWay, demanding information; I leaned from the window and told them what\r\nI knew. All the French people in the neighborhood stood out in the\r\nstreet and chattered excitedly for hours afterward it seemed. This\r\nmorning Madame told us what had happened. In the house next door lives a\r\ntall and handsome girl. A sergeant suitor of hers, crazy with jealousy\r\nand cognac, had shot wildly at a rival entering her door, emptying his\r\nautomatic, fortunately without effect.\r\n\r\n\r\nGoncourt, February 16.\r\n\r\nTwice a week each one of us goes to pay a visit at the local hospital.\r\nThis is a depressing place—two large dingy rooms in what was once, to\r\njudge from the inscription over the door, some sort of ecclesiastical\r\nschool. We take the boys magazines and newspapers, oranges and jam. This\r\nweek I had a new idea. I would read aloud to them. In the Bourmont\r\nwarehouse I came across a volume of W. W. Jacobs’ short stories. Here\r\nwas just the thing, I thought, such simple slap-stick humour must appeal\r\nto the most unsophisticated understanding.\r\n\r\nI hurried to the hospital with my prize. The orderlies, not expecting a\r\nlady visitor, were in the midst of a Black Jack game. Red and flustered,\r\none lad tried to hide the little heaps of money on the floor by standing\r\non them; I pretended not to see. Yes, they thought it would be all right\r\nif I should read to the patients. They went ahead to the ward to\r\nannounce me. All the cots were full, making sixteen invalids in all. I\r\nselected a story—an old favorite, I was sure it would prove\r\nirresistible—and started to read. The story tells of an eccentric\r\nskipper with a fad for doctoring. One by one, his crew, realizing his\r\nweakness, develop mysterious maladies. They are excused from duty, put\r\nto bed, petted and cossetted. Finally the mate becomes desperate. He\r\nguarantees that he will cure them all; the skipper is sceptical but\r\nallows him a free hand. The mate sets to work to compound some\r\n“medicine,” a wonderful and fearful brew made of ink, vinegar, kerosene\r\nand bilge-water. After a few doses, presto! the crew is hale and hearty\r\nonce again.\r\n\r\nI read with all the animation I could muster, and to me the story had\r\nnever appeared funnier, but try my hardest, I couldn’t seem to “get it\r\nover.” Not a chuckle, not a grin lightened my solemn audience. They were\r\nutterly, blankly, unresponsive. I began to wonder if it were possible\r\nthat not one of them could understand English. At last I ended. As I\r\nclosed the book a whoop of delight went up from the orderlies;\r\n\r\n“That’s you all over, Johnny!”\r\n\r\n“Gee, that guy must have wrote that story about you, Slim.”\r\n\r\n“Say, Miss, can’t you let us have the recipe for that medicine? We need\r\nit in our business.”\r\n\r\nThe invalids grinned sulkily. In one awful moment I realized what I had\r\ndone.\r\n\r\n“Of course,” I stammered, “this wasn’t meant to have any personal\r\napplication!” But the mischief was already done. There was nothing to do\r\nbut to retire with dignity.\r\n\r\nHowever, I couldn’t bear to give up my scheme entirely. Today I went\r\nagain; this time having carefully selected my story. To my astonishment\r\nthe ward proved empty, all except for three boys who were crouching on\r\nthe floor shooting craps; I drew back.\r\n\r\n“Perhaps they would rather not be disturbed.”\r\n\r\n“They ought to be in bed anyway,” growled the orderly, and chased the\r\npatients back to their cots.\r\n\r\nI read to them; there was no way out of it. They listened politely to\r\nthe end, but all the while I felt they were longing to resume their\r\ninterrupted game. Tonight I expressed my surprise over the deserted ward\r\nto Captain X. He roared at my innocence.\r\n\r\n“You didn’t expect to find any fellows in hospital _today_ did you? Why,\r\nthis is Saturday, and there isn’t any drill tomorrow!”\r\n\r\n\r\nGoncourt, February 18.\r\n\r\nEvery day we must go to see how the new hut is progressing. This\r\ninvolves wading through a wilderness of mud. I had thought that Bourmont\r\nhad taught me everything that one could learn about French mud this side\r\nof the trenches, but Goncourt has shown me that it has possibilities\r\nhitherto undreamed.\r\n\r\nThe new hut is on the far edge of the town, on the east bank of the\r\nMeuse. Near it are grouped the barracks of the Milk Battalion, so called\r\nnot because, as I first supposed, it is composed of heavy drinkers, but\r\nbecause it is comprised of Companies I, K, L, and M. These barracks,\r\nwhich were bequeathed to us by the French, are, the boys tell me,\r\ninfested with vermin. In the mess-hall of Company M we hold our weekly\r\nmovie-shows and our occasional concerts.\r\n\r\nThe hut, which is very large, and shipped here in sections, goes up\r\nslowly. Army details are proverbial in their ability to consume time.\r\nThen we are constantly being held back by shortage of materials; lumber\r\nand nails and such things being desperately hard to obtain in France at\r\npresent. Not long ago the divisional Construction Man, who is a young\r\nfellow with poor eyes and considerable initiative, was driven to the\r\ndesperate resort of appropriating French Army lumber. For a while all\r\nwent well, then the thefts grew too bold, and the Construction Man was\r\nsummoned before the French colonel in command. As the colonel knew\r\nEnglish, and so could not be put off by any “no compris” bluff, the\r\nConstruction Man had a pretty bad quarter hour of it, but in the end was\r\nlet off with a warning.\r\n\r\nThe window frames of the hut are to be filled in with _vitex_, a curious\r\nglass substitute, which looks like a thin celluloid glaze over very fine\r\nmeshed wire. It is only slightly transparent, rather fragile and very\r\ncostly but it does admit the light, in this respect being far better\r\nthan the oiled cloth in use in most barracks. When the _vitex_ is cut to\r\nfit the frames, many odd scraps are left over and these I have been\r\ndistributing among the boys so they can substitute them for the old\r\nnewspapers or sacking now in vogue for billet windows.\r\n\r\nIf they only could hurry up that hut!\r\n\r\n“You wait and see,” say the boys; “just as soon as that hut is finished\r\nwe’ll be moving. That’s always the way with this regiment. Sure as you\r\nlive, when that hut’s done, we’ll be off for the front.”\r\n\r\nAnd it begins to look as if this might come true.\r\n\r\n“Do you really think so?” I asked Mr K. today.\r\n\r\n“There’s no telling,” he replied. “Perhaps. But anyway the boys will\r\nknow we did our best.”\r\n\r\nMeanwhile the state of the men is worse than ever. An order has been\r\nissued in Goncourt that no soldier may enter a civilian house without a\r\nspecial permit. The reason given is that certain of the townspeople have\r\nbeen illegally selling the men strong drink. The soldiers, however,\r\ndeclare bitterly that the real reason is that the officers wish to have\r\na clear field with the village damsels.\r\n\r\n\r\nGoncourt, February 21.\r\n\r\nWe have had our first taste of the trenches; these are not real trenches\r\nto be sure but simply practice trenches which lie on the hilly uplands\r\nwest of Goncourt. For two days we have been in a tumult with a dress\r\nrehearsal of manœuvers at the front. The whole brigade in battle array\r\nhas passed under our window. Colonels and soup-kitchens, mules and\r\nmajors, supply trains, ambulances, machine-guns, everything. Yesterday\r\nas Company F was starting on its hike to the trenches, word came that\r\nthe mules who pulled their field-kitchen were indisposed. Company F had\r\nno mind to eat corn-willy and hard bread for dinner. They seized the\r\nsoup wagon and pulled it by hand, all the way up the hills. Meeting\r\ntheir major on the way, they shouted in unison; “The mules went on sick\r\nreport and got marked quarters. We went on sick report and they marked\r\nus duty.” But they got their dinner hot.\r\n\r\nTonight I heard the sad tale of Mr. B. the new secretary at Saint\r\nThiebault. Company A had marched off to spend the day in the trenches.\r\nMr. B. had an inspiration; he filled a large suit-case full of chocolate\r\nand cigarettes: hailed a passing ambulance and set out to carry first\r\naid to Company A in its ordeal in the trenches. Unluckily neither Mr. B.\r\nnor the driver knew just where the field of operations lay. Two miles\r\nnorth of Goncourt Mr. B. got out and started to “cut across lots.” It\r\nwas raining; he waded through swamps, he scratched through thickets, he\r\nwallowed in ploughed fields, with that suit case which must have weighed\r\na good eighty pounds growing heavier at every step. There being no sun\r\nto guide him, he got lost and wandered about in circles. Finally, after\r\nseveral hours, he arrived in a state of collapse at the field of\r\nmanœuveurs. Then instead of A Company he encountered another company, a\r\nperfectly strange company; they demanded chocolate and he didn’t have\r\nthe heart to deny them. After the last cake of chocolate and the last\r\npackage of cigarettes had disappeared an officer came up, an officer\r\nfrom still another company, and proceeded to tell Mr. B. in very plain\r\nlanguage what he thought of him for leaving his men out. And when that\r\nofficer had done with Mr. B. an officer from the company which had been\r\nfed came up in an awful temper and “bawled out” Mr. B. because forsooth\r\nhis men had made such a mess, throwing away the chocolate wrappers that\r\nwhen the others left, his company would have to stay behind to “police\r\nup” the trenches!\r\n\r\nPoor Mr. B! My heart goes out to him.\r\n\r\nThis evening as we were about to close the canteen, my friend, the\r\nmule-skinner from Texas appeared in the hut. He had a sort of a\r\nweak-in-the-knees expression on his face.\r\n\r\n“What’s the matter?”\r\n\r\n“Met the Old Man,” he answered ruefully,—the “Old Man” is the general in\r\ncommand of the division—“Gee! but he sure did give me some bawlin’ out!”\r\n\r\n“But why?”\r\n\r\nHe explained that his sergeant had misunderstood orders and told him to\r\ngo out in his usual rig. The general, encountering the mule-skinner\r\nwithout his proper war-paint, had expressed his mind to him on the\r\nmatter.\r\n\r\n“Jumpin’ Jupiter! but the langwidge that that old bird used! I sure will\r\nhand it to him! Why, my ears ain’t done burnin’ yet!” And he shook his\r\nhead like a man half dazed.\r\n\r\n“What did he say?”\r\n\r\nThe mule-skinner grew red as a beet, stared at me horrified.\r\n\r\n“I couldn’t repeat it, ma’am! I couldn’t repeat nary word of it!”\r\n\r\nThat a general should so scandalize a mule-skinner, and a Texas\r\nmule-skinner at that, by his address, was so intriguing to my fancy that\r\nI laughed all the way home.\r\n\r\nWe have a new colonel; he has declared that the regiment is not fit for\r\nthe front, and so has laid out a two weeks’ programme of gruelling hikes\r\nand intensive training, in order at the eleventh hour to try to jack us\r\nup to standard.\r\n\r\nThe Gendarme leaves tomorrow to go _en permission_.\r\n\r\n\r\nGoncourt, February 25.\r\n\r\nIf I were God I would lay a blight on every grape-vine in France; then I\r\nwould sink every still, wine press, distillery and brewery to the bottom\r\nof the sea.\r\n\r\nWe have had payday. It happened Friday. The total results didn’t make\r\nthemselves evident immediately; it was instead a cumulative effect, a\r\ncrescendo, beginning Friday and reaching its climax yesterday. On these\r\nthree days, out of the twenty-five hundred men stationed here,\r\ntwenty-four hundred and ninety-three, I could take my oath, have come\r\ninto the canteen and leaned over the counter, drunk;—that is to say,\r\nvisibly and undeniably under the influence of liquor. When a lad, as\r\nsome half dozen did,—those composing the regular attendance in the group\r\nabout the fire,—came into the canteen entirely and unmistakably sober,\r\none welcomed him as a drowning man does a spar. For a moment one had\r\ncome in touch with something stable in a reeling world.\r\n\r\nOut of a company of two hundred and fifty last night ninety were capable\r\nof standing Retreat.\r\n\r\nI have learned to gauge the stages. When a man looks you squarely in the\r\neye and declares vociferously, “Never took a drink in all my life!” he\r\nis very drunk indeed. And there is always someone nearby to wink and\r\ncomment; “He must have joined the gang that pours it down with a\r\nfunnel.”\r\n\r\nSaturday night a very red-faced lad came up to the counter and insisted\r\non conversing; from each pocket in his raincoat protruded a long-necked\r\nbottle. I stood it for a few minutes, then:\r\n\r\n“Please,” I said, “won’t you take those bottles out of here? I just hate\r\nto see them.”\r\n\r\n“Bottles!” he expostulated. “What do you mean, _bottles_!”\r\n\r\n“I mean just those.” I pointed.\r\n\r\n“Why I ain’t got a bottle on me!” he burst out indignantly, fairly\r\nglaring at me. Seeing it was hopeless, I edged away toward the other end\r\nof the counter, leaving him standing there, a perfect picture of\r\noutraged and insulted virtue, with those bottles bristling all over him.\r\n\r\nThe whole town is pervaded by a warm glow of geniality. Boys that used\r\nto nod shyly in answer to your “Good morning” now lean from their loft\r\nwindows as you pass to call a greeting. Last night, my friend the M. P.\r\ntells me, he heard a racket in one of the sheepfolds up on our street.\r\nGoing to investigate he met a “bunch o’ drunken wops” coming out of the\r\ndoor, every man of them carrying a struggling sheep under each arm. He\r\nshouted at them; they dropped the sheep and fled.\r\n\r\nThe French find it all vastly amusing. “_Beaucoup zig zag_,” they cry.\r\nIt means, I suppose, riches for them.\r\n\r\nAnd yet in all this orgy I have not yet encountered a single word of\r\ndisrespect, nor heard one objectionable expression uttered. Last night I\r\ncaught an angry splutter from the crowd in front of the counter. One\r\nboy, evidently a shade less tipsy, had admonished another boy apparently\r\na shade more so, to be careful of his language out of respect for me.\r\n“Whu’d ’you think? D’you think I ain’t got sense enough to know how to\r\ntalk when there’s an American lady present?” For a moment it looked as\r\nif there might be a fight.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile the guard-house, the real guard-house, is so crowded that they\r\nhave had to put duck-boards across the rafters for the prisoners to\r\nsleep on.\r\n\r\nFrom a nearby town where part of another regiment is stationed come even\r\nmore startling stories. Certain officers there went so wild that they\r\nstarted to blow up the town with hand grenades. And one of them coming\r\ninto the Y. held up the secretary at the point of his pistol until he\r\nsold him—instead of the ordinary allowance of one or two\r\npackages—several cartons of his favorite brand of cigarettes.\r\n\r\nThe new colonel is said to be horrified. But what could he expect? Take\r\nan odd lot of twenty-five hundred boys, remove them from every decent\r\nrestraining influence, hike them all day through the interminable mud\r\nand rain until they drop by the roadside, bring them back at night to\r\ndark, cold, damp, filthy, vermin-ridden lofts and stables, add the nerve\r\nstrain of the imminent prospect of their first time at the front, close\r\nevery door to them except the door of the café, give them money;—what\r\ncould anyone expect?\r\n\r\n\r\nGoncourt, February 27.\r\n\r\nMy friend Pat is in the hospital; not the local hospital, but Base 18\r\nsituated at Bazoilles, some six miles to the north of Goncourt. This\r\nafternoon, having our time free between one and four, Mr. K. and I\r\ndecided to go to call on him.\r\n\r\n“Are we going to walk?” I asked.\r\n\r\n“Oh we’ll get a lift; one always does.”\r\n\r\nBut the lift didn’t heave in sight until we were half way there; then it\r\nwas an ambulance that slowed down in answer to our signals.\r\n\r\n“Give us a ride?”\r\n\r\n“Sure, if you aren’t afraid of the mumps.”\r\n\r\nI was, dreadfully afraid. But Mr. K. wasn’t, he had already had them, on\r\nboth sides. I hesitated, then decided to take a chance. We rode into\r\nBazoilles in an ambulance full of mumps.\r\n\r\nAs for Pat, we hadn’t an idea in what sort of shape we might find him.\r\nOnce, Mr. K. told me, he had come upon Pat in one of his visits to the\r\nSaint Thiebault infirmary. Pat was lying on a cot with his eyes closed\r\nand a sanctified look of patient suffering upon his face.\r\n\r\n“Why what’s wrong with you, Pat?”\r\n\r\n“Ssh!” Pat squinted about to see that neither doctor nor orderly was\r\nwithin ear-shot, then an Irish grin spread over his impudent features.\r\n“Nothin’ at all,” he whispered joyously, “just nothin’ at all!”\r\n\r\nBut this time we found Pat’s ailment real enough. He was in the “bone\r\nward” with a badly broken wrist.\r\n\r\n“How did it happen?” we inquired.\r\n\r\n“Sure an’ it happened this way,” and he told us both the official and\r\nthe confidential versions. Confidentially, Pat’s wrist had been broken\r\nby a blow from an M. P.’s billy in an after-payday argument at Saint\r\nThiebault. Officially it had been broken two days later in the barracks\r\nby an accidental knock from a gun-barrel. _Pat had hiked and drilled\r\nwith a broken wrist for two solid days in order to be able to claim that\r\nhe had been disabled in the line of duty!_ After the second day,\r\nconvinced that the encounter with the M. P. was sufficiently a matter of\r\npast history to be discredited, Pat had reported at Sick Call with his\r\ntrumped-up tale and had as usual gotten by. Now as he lay on his cot he\r\nwas occupying himself by conjuring up visions of the party to which he\r\nand his buddy were going to treat that M. P. just as soon as he (Pat)\r\nshould get his hospital discharge.\r\n\r\nAs we talked I noticed a lad who was walking about the ward with his\r\nright hand done up in bloody bandages. He looked self-conscious and\r\nembarrassed as if he half hoped, half feared to be recognized. I caught\r\nPat’s eye, his voice dropped to a whisper.\r\n\r\n“That’s Philip R. Don’t you remember him?”\r\n\r\nOf course! I smiled at Philip, but he turned away and wouldn’t come to\r\nspeak to me. Mr. K. went over to him; they talked for a long while in\r\nundertones. Later I heard the whole pitiful story. He had been drinking,\r\nthe terror that was haunting him had suddenly gripped. He had taken his\r\nrifle and shot himself through his right hand, mutilating it, in order\r\nthat he might not be sent to the front. Placed under arrest on\r\nsuspicion, his nerve had utterly given way. He had made a full\r\nconfession. It was likely to go hard with him.\r\n\r\nWhile Mr. K. was listening to Philip, Pat was telling me about the\r\nregiment of southern negro engineers who had come to Bazoilles to help\r\nbuild the new hospital. Every time there was an air-raid alarm, Pat\r\ndeclared, they knelt down and prayed by companies.\r\n\r\nI emptied out my _musette_ bag onto Pat’s cot. Pat looked at the\r\noranges, dates, chocolates and cigarettes that we had brought, then took\r\na squint along the hungry-looking ward.\r\n\r\n“Well, I guess I’ll get a taste,” he said.\r\n\r\nHe was “in soft” he told us. The nurses let him help serve the meals. He\r\nhad free run of the kitchen and all the milk that he wanted to drink.\r\nYet he was already chafing at the restraint and in his wicked head he\r\nwas scheming schemes. Some day in the not-too-distant future he was\r\ngoing to give the hospital guards the slip, make a night of it, and\r\npaint “Bazooie” red.\r\n\r\nTonight word reached us that a Y. M. C. A. woman worker has been killed\r\nin Paris in an air-raid. She was sick and they had sent her to the\r\nHôpital Claude-Bernard. This time the bombs found it.\r\n\r\n\r\nGoncourt, March 2.\r\n\r\nThe new hut is opened. Finished or unfinished, we made up our minds that\r\nwe would open that hut Saturday night, and open it we did. The last two\r\ndays have been fairly frantic. Yesterday we washed up; today we dried\r\nout and decorated. The cleaning was the worst of it. The hut, as I have\r\nhinted, is a sort of island in a sea of mud. Consequently as the\r\nbuilding went up, the floor, walls, counter, ceiling, everything was\r\nsplotched, streaked and plastered with dirt. Thursday night as I looked\r\naround the hut my heart sank. The place was a sight.\r\n\r\n“You can’t do anything about it,” they told me.\r\n\r\n“But something has got to be done!”\r\n\r\nFriday morning arrived a detail of eight prisoners from the guard-house.\r\nThey had come to scrub. The guard in charge took his stand, leaning\r\nagainst one of the pillars, his loaded rifle in his hands; to see that\r\nno one escaped was his only responsibility, the rest was up to me. My\r\ndetail proved a sullen, stubborn lot, slouching, cursing under their\r\nbreath, all their self-respect turned to a smouldering rebellion; after\r\nthe first few minutes I saw just how much work left to themselves they\r\nwould be likely to accomplish. So I told them in a matter-of-fact way\r\njust how things stood: that we had promised to open the hut the next\r\nday, that it was, as they could see, in a frightful mess, that I\r\nrealized they were up against a stiff job, but I did _so_ hope that we\r\ncould put it through. Then I got a pail and a scrubbing-brush and went\r\nout and scrubbed side by side with them. It is of course strictly\r\nagainst the rules to talk to prisoners, but all the while I worked I\r\n“jollied” my “jail-birds” for all my wits were worth. I admired\r\necstatically the spots which they had scrubbed, I moaned in despair over\r\nthe unscrubbed places. Inside of an hour the prisoners were all grinning\r\ncheerfully as they worked like beavers. When the guard was looking the\r\nother way I sneaked them cigarettes. By night the hut was very damp and\r\nsomewhat streaky, but it would pass, at least by candle-light. I didn’t\r\ncare though my arms were so lame I could hardly lift them, and my hands\r\nin ruins.\r\n\r\n“I congratulate you,” said the new Secretary, “I never thought it could\r\nbe done.”\r\n\r\n“If only nobody looks at the ceiling!”\r\n\r\nFor the ceiling was beyond our reach, and back and forth over every one\r\nof its boards had tramped the hob-nailed boots of the A. E. F. and every\r\nstep had left its muddy print. As I looked I thought; if we only had the\r\nsignatures to put beside each footprint, what a fascinating autograph\r\ncollection it would make!\r\n\r\nToday we spent in a mad tear, making the hut beautiful and moving our\r\neffects over from the “Guard-House.” The moving was accomplished by the\r\naid of the Wall-Eyed Boy and his donkey. These are two of Goncourt’s\r\nleading citizens, the donkey, an ancient moth-eaten beast, being\r\nparticularly intimately known to a certain group of doughboys who would\r\njoyfully murder him. His stable is directly beneath the loft in which\r\nthey are billeted and every morning, prompt as an alarm clock, at 4 A.\r\nM. that donkey brays, and brays until the soundest sleeper is awakened.\r\nThe Wall-Eyed Boy’s name is Martin, and as a donkey in France is\r\nslangily called _un Martin_, as we call a mule “Maud,” the two go under\r\nthe title of _Les Deux Martins_. When _les Deux Martins_ and I went\r\ntrudging along the muddy streets of Goncourt, side by side, with the\r\nlittle tippy cart loaded with canteen truck bumping along behind, the M.\r\nP.s thought it a rare joke. “I wish Sister Susy could see you now,”\r\ncalled one.\r\n\r\nThe last few hours were spent frantically decorating. Our color scheme\r\nis red and blue. This came about through accident rather than intention.\r\nWe had a bolt of turkey-red cotton bunting for curtains, only to\r\ndiscover that this did not darken the lighted windows sufficiently to\r\ncomply with the now strictly enforced aeroplane regulations. So I asked\r\na secretary starting for Paris to bring me a bolt of black cambric in\r\norder to make a set of inner supplementary curtains. The secretary\r\nreturning, brought bright blue; black, on account of the demand for\r\nmourning, had proved too expensive. At first I was non-plussed, but then\r\ndiscovered that the bright red and blue made rather a jolly combination.\r\nSo each one of our many windows is now giddy with red and blue draperies\r\nand the seat that runs all around our writing room is brave with blue\r\nand red cushions (stuffed, if the truth must be told, with shavings!)\r\nBetween each two windows is tacked one of my stunning big French war\r\nposters, the long counter is covered with red-checked oil-cloth, a\r\nbouquet of flags flies from the proscenium arch over the stage which,\r\nfor the occasion, is banked beautifully with evergreens. Altogether we\r\npresent rather the appearance of a perpetual Fourth of July celebration,\r\nbut then who cares? If one can’t be aesthetic one can at least be gay,\r\nand it’s anything to take one’s mind off the mud!\r\n\r\nThe Gendarme came back from her leave tonight just in time for the Grand\r\nOpening. This took place at seven o’clock. The hall was packed to the\r\nlast inch. As one boy said; “There’s plenty of room for me, but there\r\nain’t none for the buttons on my coat.” There was a reason for this. The\r\nnew colonel was to make a speech and he had advised all the officers and\r\nnon-coms, in the whole regiment to be present. I caught a glimpse of\r\nCompany A wedged in among the suffocating mass. Everything, I\r\nunderstand, went off very nicely; there was much music by the band and\r\nsomebody sang Danny Deever very thrillingly, but I was too busy in the\r\nkitchen to pay much attention. The new Secretary had wanted me to sit on\r\nthe platform, but after a three days’ debate, he had finally agreed to\r\nlet me off, and luckily, for the minute the last note of the S. S. B.\r\nhad sounded we were ready to start handing out the hot chocolate and\r\ncookies over the counter to the mob. When everyone else had been fed the\r\ncolonel himself appeared back of the counter, to graciously accept a cup\r\nof chocolate, and make himself generally charming.\r\n\r\nWhen the last guest had gone and we were getting ready to shut up the\r\nhut for the night, the Chief who had come over from Bourmont for the\r\noccasion drew me aside, looking solemn.\r\n\r\n“I have a question to put to you.”\r\n\r\n“What is it?”\r\n\r\n“The division leaves for the front within a short while. Do you wish to\r\ngo with them?”\r\n\r\n“Of course!” said I.\r\n\r\n\r\nGoncourt, March 8.\r\n\r\nThis week has gone by in a whirl. Because it was our first and\r\npresumably our last week in the big hut we wanted to make it just as\r\nnice as was humanly possible. And this hasn’t been an easy task because\r\nwith the regiment putting on the last touches before they go to the\r\nfront, there hasn’t been a bit of spare man-power available to help us;\r\nand the mere problem of keeping that huge place anything like clean has\r\nalmost swamped us. After mess at night, to be sure, we have no lack of\r\nassistance. The boys swarm into the little kitchen in droves, eager to\r\nhelp stir the chocolate, or cut the bread for the sandwiches. If only\r\nten out of every dozen would be content to stay the other side of the\r\ncounter, it would simplify matters, but much as they may be underfoot\r\none hasn’t the heart to turn them out. Those who can’t get into the\r\nkitchen hang about the doors, looking in, teasing for a “hand-out” of\r\nbread and jam. “I’m just so hungry,” sighed a lad plaintively today,\r\nlooking at me out of the corner of his eyes, “I could eat the jamb off\r\nthe door!”\r\n\r\nWe have a Frenchwoman to help us in the kitchen. She is a treasure, shy\r\nand bright-eyed as a brown bird, and so tiny that we have to set a\r\npacking-box by the stove for her to stand on when she stirs the\r\nchocolate. She is deaf and speaks _patois_, so between her strange\r\nFrench and mine still stranger we have droll times making each other\r\nunderstand. Yet, none the less, she and the boys manage to keep up a\r\nrunning fire of badinage and when they become too rowdy, the tiny thing\r\nturns ridiculously bellicose and threatens to whip them all with her\r\nchocolate paddle. At night we all go home together and one tall lad must\r\nalways come along in order to help Madame over the road of a thousand\r\nmud holes that leads from the hut to the highway, lest she be drowned in\r\ntransit. She carries a funny little gasolene lamp that gives about as\r\nmuch light as an ambitious fire-fly and all the way to the main road one\r\ncan hear her moaning; “_Mon Dieu, quel chemin! Mon Dieu, quel chemin!_”\r\n\r\nThis has been our week’s programme:\r\n\r\n    Sunday.       Hot chocolate and cookies\r\n                  Religious Service with special music\r\n                  Song Service. More chocolate\r\n\r\n    Monday.       French Classes\r\n                  Hot chocolate and jam sandwiches\r\n\r\n    Tuesday.      Boxing and Wrestling Matches\r\n                  Hot chocolate and sardine sandwiches\r\n\r\n    Wednesday.    Band Concert\r\n                  Hot chocolate and jam sandwiches\r\n\r\n    Thursday.     Movies\r\n                  Hot chocolate and cookies\r\n\r\n    Friday.       Sing Fest with Solos\r\n                  Hot chocolate and jam sandwiches\r\n\r\n    Saturday.     Stunt Programme\r\n                  Canned fruit and cookies\r\n\r\nThe hut has been filled every night, hundreds and hundreds of soldiers,\r\nthe auditorium packed and the writing-room holding at least a hundred\r\nmore, while the chocolate line, coiling and curling about like a monster\r\nsnake, has for hours seemed absolutely endless. We have worked out a\r\nsystem for the chocolate serving—the Gendarme is cashier, taking the\r\nmoney and making change, fifty centimes or nine cents for a cup of\r\nchocolate and a sandwich, or six spice cookies, or four fig ones. One\r\nboy ladles out the chocolate. I push the cups over the counter, another\r\nboy hands out the cookies, a third gathers up the dirty cups and carries\r\nthem to the kitchen, where three or four others are busy washing and\r\nwiping them, while Heaven only knows how many more are around the stove,\r\nhelping Madame stir the next kettleful, opening milk cans, or dipping\r\nwater into a third container. Thus we keep the line merrily wagging\r\nalong.\r\n\r\nLast night, quite unknown to the men, Pershing himself came to town,\r\nwhirled in after dark in his big limousine and whirled away again as\r\nsuddenly and secretly as he had arrived. He came to give the officers\r\nfinal instructions as to their conduct at the front.\r\n\r\nThe first faint wistful scents of Spring are in the air. This morning\r\nMadame brought to our room a tiny bouquet of snow-drops. And one hears\r\nfrom Saint Thiebault a rumour of early violets.\r\n\r\n\r\nGoncourt, March 10.\r\n\r\nThis morning shortly after I reached the hut, one of the men from the\r\nBourmont office came in with a note for me, it read:\r\n\r\n    My dear Miss ——\r\n\r\n    I am glad to be able to tell you more or less confidentially\r\n    that you will probably go to the front very shortly. You had\r\n    better have everything ready so you could leave on short notice\r\n    any time after tomorrow noon.\r\n\r\n    Very sincerely yours, ——\r\n\r\nEnclosed in the envelope was a little slip headed _Suggestions for Men\r\ngoing to the Front_. It began “Go light, take no trunk,” and ended “We\r\nprovide helmets, gas masks, etc.” The note was dated yesterday.\r\n\r\nI left the canteen and hurried back here to my billet to pack, while the\r\nGendarme, who does not wish to go with the division but prefers to stay\r\nback and be reassigned, remained at the hut. What with sorting and\r\nmending things, the packing took all afternoon. What to leave behind in\r\nstorage and what to take is no end of a question. Unfortunately the\r\n_Suggestions_ were compiled with a view strictly to masculine\r\nnecessities.\r\n\r\nIt has been a grey dismal afternoon. A melancholy donkey in somebody’s\r\nback-yard has kept up an incessant braying. “He does not please himself\r\nat Goncourt,” explained Madame. “He is a Saint Thiebault donkey.”\r\nMeanwhile half the regiment, it seems, has strayed by under my open\r\nwindow. I never knew before how consistently and persistently profane\r\nthe A. E. F. could be when left to its own devices. The amazing part of\r\nit is;—since this seems to be their natural style of expression, how do\r\nthey manage to slough it all and talk with such perfect prunes and\r\nprisms propriety in the canteens?\r\n\r\nAt supper time we were surprised by a Concert Party which had arrived\r\ntoday unexpectedly in this area. We were particularly glad to have them\r\nas the nervous tension among the boys is marked enough to make us\r\nwelcome anything to divert their attention. We could have the regular\r\nSunday evening service first, we decided, and then the concert to finish\r\noff with. The Concert Party came to supper at our mess. There was an\r\nornamental Russian violinist, male, an American accompanist, also male,\r\nand a little French actress-singer. The minute we laid eyes on her we\r\nknew that the concert would be a success. She was all frills and\r\nfrippery; lace, pink-rose buds and pale blue silk, with yellow curls and\r\ngreat blue eyes peering from beneath a quaint little rose-wreathed poke\r\nbonnet; an amazing vision of femininity to appear suddenly in the mud\r\nand dingy squalor of Goncourt!\r\n\r\nThe family Peirut was in a great state of mind over such distinguished\r\nvisitors. They brought out food enough to feed the company a week, and\r\nkept hovering about the table, urging the dishes on our guests and\r\nemitting little wails of dismay when any one of the artists refused to\r\neat enough for all three.\r\n\r\nI stayed at our billet to finish up my packing, and went over to the hut\r\nlate in the evening. The concert was half finished. As we anticipated,\r\nthe little singer had made a hit. She gave some French songs,\r\naccompanying them with clever pantomine. Then she sang _Huckleberry\r\nFinn_ and _Oh Johnny!_ As the phrase has it, she “got them going.” She\r\nproved a past-mistress in the art of using her eyes. They winked at her\r\nand she winked back. Every last man in the first six rows was flirting\r\nwith her, and every one was convinced that he was making a hit all his\r\nown. Several, it was confided to me afterwards, developed matrimonial\r\naspirations on the spot. Then a tragic thing occurred. For the closing\r\nnumber they must give the Star Spangled Banner. Everybody rose, and\r\neverybody in duty bound removed their hats. The little singer took one\r\nwild survey of the audience, gasped, choked, then retreated\r\nprecipitately in order to conceal her giggles. A week ago an order was\r\npublished that the regiment should have their hair shaved off before\r\ngoing to the front;—every head in the whole auditorium, thus suddenly\r\nlaid bare, was bald as an egg!\r\n\r\nFrom latest advices it appears that the troops will start entraining the\r\nmiddle of the week. We are going on ahead in order to be there to serve\r\nthem hot chocolate when they detrain after the journey. Every one has a\r\ndifferent idea where that will be, but the best guess seems to be the\r\nLunéville sector. What sort of conditions we will find at the front I\r\nhaven’t the least idea. I missed the special conference held at Bourmont\r\nthe other day, in which instructions and information to the personnel\r\nbound for the front were given. The driver who was to call for us,\r\nfailed to do so; I set out to walk, only to find on arriving at Bourmont\r\nthat the conference had been cut short, and was already over. Nobody has\r\ntold me a word except to tease me by telling me that I will have to have\r\nmy hair cut off in order to wear a gas-mask. Mr. K. amuses himself by\r\npredicting cellars and cooties. The Peiruts shake their heads and talk\r\nabout my _courage_, but I can see that they mean folly. As for the\r\nGendarme’s friends, Lieutenant Z. warns: “Take my advice, stay out of\r\nit. It’s a man’s game out there.” While Captain X. splutters; “Sending\r\nyou to the front without any gas-drill, it’s nothing short of\r\ncold-blooded murder.” Thus do our friends encourage us.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III: RATTENTOUT—THE FRONT\r\n\r\n\r\nBar-le-Duc, March 12.\r\n\r\nIt’s not to be the Lunéville sector after all, it’s to be the sector\r\njust south of Verdun!\r\n\r\nWe arrived here at Bar-le-Duc last night after a six-hour trip by motor\r\ncar. Mr. K. came by motor-cycle; most of the other men travelled by\r\ntruck, sitting perched on top of a load of luggage, canvas cots, and\r\nchocolate boilers. The truck broke down somewhere _en route_ and never\r\nreached Bar-le-Duc until this morning, when it rolled in carrying a\r\nrather weary-looking lot of passengers.\r\n\r\nTomorrow we go on to our station behind the lines. Today we have spent\r\nshopping for supplies. We have bought writing paper; materials to make\r\nhot chocolate, paying two francs and a half apiece or almost fifty cents\r\nfor a small-sized can of condensed milk; and dozens of gross of little\r\njars of confiture. Ever since I was a child _Bar-le-Duc_ has meant just\r\nthe one thing to me,—those little glasses of delectable currant preserve\r\nwhich bear its label. We went around to the wholesale houses which\r\nhandle the famous _Confitures Fins de Bar-le-Duc_. The sight of all\r\nthose gleaming rows of glass jars filled with deep crimson or\r\namber-colored currants was one that I shan’t easily forget.\r\n\r\nBar-le-Duc is a city which shows the wounds of war. Time and again,\r\nunfortified, defenceless as she is, she has known _the terror that\r\nflieth by night_. Last summer several blocks in the very heart of the\r\ncity were completely demolished by bombs and the wilderness of ruins\r\nlies there untouched. All over the city great black signs are painted on\r\nthe houses; _Cave, Cave voutée_,—vaulted cellar,—_Place Pour 40\r\nPersonnes_. At the end of the afternoon we climbed, Mr. K and I, to the\r\ntop of the ancient clock-tower which stands on the edge of the\r\nfortress-citadel of the Dukes of Bar, overlooking the city. Just above\r\nthe clock we came upon a tiny platform transformed for the time being\r\ninto light-housekeeping apartments for two poilus who night and day keep\r\nwatch there for enemy aircraft. As we stood on the little balcony\r\noutside and looked down on the house-tops of the city spread beneath us,\r\nwith the little children playing in the streets, a telephone bell in the\r\ntower tingled. A moment later one of the poilus announced; “A squadrille\r\nof Gothas has just crossed the lines, headed for Paris.”\r\n\r\nAlas, poor Paris! Yet the news brought a feeling of relief with it. The\r\nlittle children of Bar-le-Duc are safe for the night, it seems. The\r\navions are out after bigger game.\r\n\r\n\r\nRattentout, March 14.\r\n\r\nOut from Bar-le-Duc one swings into a separate world, the\r\nWorld-Behind-the-Lines. Here one is at the back door of the war, as it\r\nwere. Passing through the half-abandoned villages one sees war in its\r\n_déshabille_; you get no sense of the thrill of it, nor even of its\r\nhorrors; only the weary disgust, the stultifying stupidity, the\r\nunutterable ennui.\r\n\r\nHere everything that moves or lives, it seems, is blue; faded blue,\r\ndingy blue, purplish or greenish blue perhaps, but blue nevertheless.\r\nEverywhere the color insists. It streaks along the roads in long, broken\r\nlines, the meagre trodden villages are blotched and patched with it.\r\nIndeed the whole horizon, at this season of the year, might be expressed\r\nin just two tones; the almost uniform grey-yellow tint that washes over\r\nthe fields, the rolling hills, the dusty roads, the squalid villages,\r\nand the ever-insistent poilu-blue.\r\n\r\nYou pass by tilled fields labeled _Culture Militaire_; great grey-green\r\naerodromes with flocks of little planes resting in rows beside them, in\r\ntheir gay paint resembling nothing in the world so much as dicky birds\r\nfresh from the toy shop; and always dotted here and there over the open\r\nfields, the little lonely graves, sometimes hedged in by fences made of\r\nsticks and always marked by a grey wooden cross on which hangs, in\r\npainted tin, the tricolor. Farther on you come to the world where men\r\nlive underground, burrowing in the earth like hunted animals. Scattered\r\nalong the roadside, or in rows under the shelter of a hill-slope,\r\neverywhere you look, are dugouts, some with the entrances covered with\r\npine-boughs, others thatched with sticks, still others hidden beneath\r\nearth-colored camouflages.\r\n\r\nWe arrived here last night about dusk. The poilus as we passed stared at\r\nus as if we were so many lunatics. Rattentout is on the right bank of\r\nthe Meuse, about six miles from the trenches. This means for one thing\r\nthat you must carry a gas-mask with you wherever you go. One even sees\r\nthe little children, what few of them are left, trudging about with\r\nsmall-sized masks slung over their shoulders. The Y. here is short of\r\nmasks and as yet M.—the only canteen worker besides myself to come with\r\nthe advance guard—and I have none. This morning when the Chief went out\r\nhe hung his mask on a peg in the hall. “If anything happens,” he said to\r\nM. and me, “you two can settle it between you, which shall have it.”\r\n\r\nOur home here is in a lordly mansion, evidently the Big House of the\r\nvillage. French officers were living here before we came. The regiment\r\nto which they belonged moving out just as we arrived, they graciously\r\nmade over the house to us. The officers had started a vegetable garden\r\nin the back-yard and this they relinquished with deep regret, one young\r\nlieutenant fairly having tears in his eyes as he took a last survey of\r\nhis rows of tiny lettuce and young cabbages.\r\n\r\nToday is to be given over to house-cleaning, and getting settled.\r\nTomorrow the troops are due to begin detraining at the two points\r\nLandrecourt and Dugny and we are to be there to serve them hot\r\nchocolate.\r\n\r\nLast night we took our supper at the dingy little house next door, a\r\nsurprisingly delicious meal, bread and butter, omelette, salad and\r\ncocoa. The house next door is one of the half-dozen or so in town still\r\ninhabited by civilians. The family consists of grandmother, mother and\r\nlittle girl of five; the husband is in the trenches. The child Pauline\r\nis half sick with a feverish cold. They could get no medicine, the\r\nmother fretted; we promised some from Bar-le-Duc. The house itself is\r\npainfully unkempt and dirty, yet Pauline is always fresh in a spotless\r\nwhite pinafore, her glossy hair immaculately brushed. This morning we\r\nwent to the house next door again for bread and coffee.\r\n\r\n“Did you sleep last night?” asked Madame.\r\n\r\n“But yes,—and you?”\r\n\r\nShe shook her head. “I was afraid of the Boche aeroplanes. I could hear\r\nthem overhead.”\r\n\r\n“But I should think you would be used to them by now.”\r\n\r\n“Ah! But that makes no difference!”\r\n\r\nWhat consideration keeps her here, clinging to the very door-step of the\r\nwar, as it were, hounded as she is, by terrors? Just the one reason, I\r\nsuppose,—that she has nowhere else to go.\r\n\r\n\r\nRattentout, March 15.\r\n\r\n_Lafayette, nous voilà!_ The first battalions of the division have\r\narrived.\r\n\r\nThe car called for us early this morning to take us to Dugny-Est where\r\nhalf the men are to detrain. We followed along the east bank of the\r\nMeuse running parallel to the _Canal de L’Est_. The canal was a dismal\r\nsight, filled with an endless line of empty abandoned barges, many of\r\nthem settling slowly down as if water-logged, a few, already sunk,\r\nleaving nothing but a bit of prow protruding above the water’s surface.\r\nWe ran along the bank for about three miles, then swung across the Meuse\r\nto Dugny. Dugny-Est is a half mile north of Dugny proper,—the terminus\r\nof a strip of railway taken over and run by American engineers. Viewed\r\nfrom the detraining tracks the landscape was bleak enough; the morasses\r\nof the Meuse, strung with barbed-wire beyond, an austere\r\ndeserted-looking church in the foreground, and, dreariest of all, right\r\nunder the boys’ feet as they detrained, almost, a large military\r\ngrave-yard.\r\n\r\nArriving at the little stone station-house made over to us for the\r\noccasion, we found the chocolate already made. Four of the Y. men had\r\nspent the night there and by dint of stoking the fires all night long,\r\nas they declared, they had gotten the five huge containers hot. The\r\nequipment assembled in haste at Bar-le-Duc was evidently proving none\r\ntoo satisfactory.\r\n\r\nI had just time to suspend a small American flag from the front of the\r\nstation-house before the first train puffed up the track. Nothing I\r\nthink has ever looked quite so good to me as that old American\r\nlocomotive. It was the first one I had seen in France. I wanted to throw\r\nmy arms around it and hug it. As one of the boys said afterwards: “Why,\r\nyou’d be happy just to lie down on the track and let the darned thing\r\nrun over you.”\r\n\r\nI stood under the flag and waved frantically, first to the American\r\ntrain crew and then, oh joy! to my Company A! There they all were,\r\ncrowded in the open doors of their box cars, “Side-door Pullmans” as\r\nthey call them, Magulligan the prize fighter, comically conspicuous with\r\nhis head done up in a sort of night-cap made from a large white\r\nhandkerchief. The train pulled by, slowed down, came to a standstill up\r\nthe track. We hustled the chocolate cans out by the roadside. Company A,\r\nthe first off the train, came marching down the road; each man held out\r\nhis mess-cup and got a dipperful of cocoa.\r\n\r\n“Where are we?” they demanded.\r\n\r\n“Four miles south of Verdun. How do you like the scenery?”\r\n\r\n“All right except the grave-yard. That’s too handy.”\r\n\r\n“Say,” spoke up one of the boys, “I heard the mud out here in the\r\ntrenches was pretty deep.”\r\n\r\n“Is that so?”\r\n\r\n“Yes they said a feller went in over his ankles there the other day.”\r\n\r\n“I wouldn’t call that very deep!” I bit.\r\n\r\n“Mm, but he went in head-first!”\r\n\r\nI asked one of the corporals how things were going.\r\n\r\n“We were feelin’ kind o’ lost,” he confessed. “Then we looked out and\r\nsaw the old flag and you. After that it seemed just like home somehow.”\r\n\r\nThey marched off down the road looking very business-like and military.\r\nNext came the other companies belonging to the first battalion, and the\r\nregimental machine-gun company. These were not permitted to stop by the\r\nstation-house on account of the danger of being observed by enemy\r\naircraft, but were halted at a distance down the road. We picked up the\r\nchocolate cans and chased after them.\r\n\r\nWhen every man in the First Battalion had had a drink, we hurried back\r\nto the stone-house to get ready for the next trainload. As I stirred the\r\nchocolate on one of the little stoves set up outside, several of the\r\ntrain crew came to talk to me. I was the first “real honest-to-God\r\nAmerican girl” they had seen in months they told me; and they were just\r\nas excited over me as I had been over their engine.\r\n\r\nIf the history of America in the Great War should ever be written down\r\nin detail, surely one chapter should be given over to a Little Iliad of\r\nthe “Six Bit Railway” that runs from Sommeil to Dugny-Est, five\r\nkilometers south of Verdun; how, as I had it from the lips of one of\r\nthose engineers, the English took it over from the French and tried to\r\nrun it and failed, how the Canadians took it after them and failed too,\r\nhow then the —— Engineers fell heir to it. How they lived with the\r\nFrench, eating French rations which were gall and wormwood to them. How\r\nthey struggled with an alien tongue and finally reduced it to a weird\r\nunholy gibberish which was yet somehow intelligible both to the French\r\nand to themselves. How they came through shell-fire and gas and bombing\r\nraids, seemingly bearing charmed lives. And how they worked forty-eight\r\nhours at a stretch whenever the big drives and shifts were on.\r\n\r\nTonight one of the secretaries told us that, as he was standing by the\r\nroadside watching while we ladled out the chocolate, one of the boys\r\nsaid to him:\r\n\r\n“I’m thinking of a toast.”\r\n\r\n“And what might that be?”\r\n\r\n“God bless American women,” the boy answered him.\r\n\r\n\r\nRattentout, March 16.\r\n\r\nWhen we reached the station-house this morning we found everyone agog\r\nover the night’s events. The detraining had gone on all night; at first\r\nwithout incident. All precautions had been taken, no one was allowed to\r\nso much as light a match. About midnight one of the marine soup-kitchens\r\nhad been unloaded and rolled down the road puffing sparks and scattering\r\ncoals. Some enterprising mess sergeant had evidently planned that his\r\nmen should have a hot meal. The French spectators in consternation had\r\nfollowed the soup-kitchen down the road, extinguishing the trailing\r\nembers, but the mischief was already done. There were German planes\r\nscouting overhead, they noted, evidently, the sparks, and signaled the\r\nrange to the German gunners. Fifteen minutes later a six inch shell\r\nexploded a few hundred yards from the little stone-house, then another\r\nand another. One shell had fallen in the very center of the grass-plot\r\nwhere Company D had lined up to eat their luncheon of cold corn-willy\r\nsandwiches and hot chocolate. The gas-alarm had been sounded. A mule\r\nteam had become frantic and bolted, encountering the marine band’s big\r\nbase drum, had made toothpicks of it. Meanwhile confusion, it seemed,\r\nhad reigned in the little stone-house. One secretary, seizing an article\r\nof underwear and putting it on his head in mistake for a helmet, had\r\ndashed madly up and down the road as the shells fell, and ended by\r\nbursting, in his _déshabille_, into the private dugout of a French\r\ncolonel.\r\n\r\nNo Americans were hurt, but one poilu had been injured and another\r\nkilled.\r\n\r\n“They have our range now,” said everybody. “And look at those Boche\r\nballoons, will you?”\r\n\r\nWe looked to the northeast; three German observation balloons were\r\nhanging just above the hills.\r\n\r\nWe stirred the chocolate and served it to whatever boys happened to be\r\nabout, boys on detail, drivers of mule-teams. One can, having been kept\r\nwarm all night, had turned. Some bright soul suggested that it was the\r\nconcussion of the shelling that had soured the milk, just as\r\nthunderstorms sometimes do. Two poilus leaned in at the window.\r\n\r\n“What are you doing?” they asked curiously. We explained; they shook\r\ntheir heads. “You spoil your soldiers.” Then, “Was anyone killed last\r\nnight?”\r\n\r\n“Yes, one Frenchman.”\r\n\r\n“Oh that’s nothing!” (_Ça ne fait rien._) They strolled away.\r\n\r\nThe friendly interpreter came in and told us that they were about to\r\nhold the poilu’s funeral.\r\n\r\nA troop-train pulled in. It was loaded with soldiers from my own\r\nregiment, the Second Battalion. The chocolate was ready, smelt\r\ndelicious.\r\n\r\n“You can’t serve it,” they told us. “On account of last night’s\r\nshelling, the troops won’t be allowed to stop until they’re well beyond\r\nthe town.”\r\n\r\n“Isn’t there _some_ way we can manage?” we teased.\r\n\r\n“No, they’ve got our range.”\r\n\r\n“Well at least we can say hello to them!”\r\n\r\nWe went down to the tracks where the men were spilling out of the box\r\ncars. They were gathering up their equipment and forming in companies in\r\ndouble time. One red-in-the-face sergeant was furiously demanding who in\r\nblazes had stolen his revolver on him; it was evident that he found the\r\npresence of ladies sadly hampering to his flow of language. Three\r\ncompanies marched off. The last to go was H Company, the company that\r\nhad been billeted on the same street with us at Goncourt. We waved and\r\nthey smiled back at us. They marched down the road, disappeared over the\r\nbrow of the hill.\r\n\r\nWe stood chatting with two boys who were on a billeting detail.\r\n\r\nThere was a dull heavy detonation beyond the hills. A moment later a\r\nstrange whistling screech shrilled over our heads. I stared into the\r\nair, trying to see—I knew of course it was a shell, but I had never\r\nthought one would travel so slowly or be quite so noisy about it. The\r\nwhistling shriek passed over us, changed to a dropping whine. Down the\r\nstreet there was a thunderous explosion followed instantly by a\r\nshattering crash. Timbers, tiles, stones, a mass of debris splashed for\r\na moment up against the sky. The shell had fallen at the cross-roads. I\r\nstared at M. I was cold all over.\r\n\r\n“It must have got them,” I heard myself whispering. “My God! it must\r\nhave got them!”\r\n\r\nWe stared down the road. Everywhere figures in poilu blue and some in\r\nkhaki, were running like rabbits towards the dugouts. It seemed to me\r\nthe uncertainty was more than I could bear.\r\n\r\n“I’m going to go and see.”\r\n\r\n“I’ll go with you,” said M.\r\n\r\nWe stopped at the station-house and put on our helmets; then we started\r\ndown the road. Just beyond the station-house we passed a little cortege\r\nof poilus carrying the body of their comrade on a stretcher-bier. They\r\nwere on their way to the church. When the first shell came over I had\r\nseen the funeral procession waver, hesitate, seem uncertain for a few\r\nmoments whether to proceed or to seek shelter, now, their indecision\r\nconquered, they were continuing their march with what seemed an added\r\ndignity. A limousine drew up behind us, stopped. In the back seat sat an\r\nAmerican major.\r\n\r\n“Give you a lift?”\r\n\r\nWe climbed in. Half way down the hill another shell shrieked over our\r\nheads, burst in front of us. We reached the cross-roads.\r\n\r\n“Let us out, please.”\r\n\r\nThe major stared, then stopped the car. We scrambled out. The car\r\nwhirled off. Two houses lay, crushed heaps of stone. In the road were\r\nthree dead horses and an automobile with a crumpled radiator. That was\r\nall. Another shell struck, sending us cowering against the nearest\r\nhouse-wall. As far as we could see the place was utterly deserted. There\r\nwas nothing to do but go back. Half-way up the hill we met a poilu, he\r\nwas carrying an O. D. blouse. He asked us where the wounded American\r\nwas; he had been carried into some house nearby; this was his coat. We\r\ncould of course tell him nothing. The wind which had been strong all\r\nmorning, was filling the air with blinding clouds of yellow dust. The\r\nshells were coming over at regular intervals, so many minutes between\r\nthem; they were all falling, it seemed, in the vicinity of the\r\ncross-roads. A little further up the hill and we began to meet mule\r\nteams from the supply train driving down. The mule-skinners on their\r\nhigh seats looked calm enough, but a number of the mules were becoming\r\nquite unmanageable. I recognized the slim lad of seventeen with whom I\r\nhad driven into Bourmont from Goncourt once after a load of canteen\r\nsupplies. As each team passed, we waved our hands and wished them luck;\r\nbut all the time I kept repeating to myself:\r\n\r\n“They’re going right down into it. God help them! Why does it have to\r\nbe?”\r\n\r\nA French officer encountered us, asked us politely if we wouldn’t like\r\nto step down into a dugout. I was amused at his manner which was as\r\ncasual as if he were offering us an umbrella in a shower. There were\r\nsome excellent dugouts up on the hill-side he assured us. “But I don’t\r\nwant to go into a dugout!” “_Mademoiselle a beaucoup d’esprit_,” he\r\nobserved, “_mais ce n’est pas prudent_.” Obediently we climbed the hill,\r\nto come upon a little group of Americans gathered about the entrance to\r\na dugout, watching the shells as they came over. Taking a peep into the\r\ndugout I found it had already been patronized by several poilus. We sat\r\non the ground and watched the shelling. On the other side of the town we\r\ncould see Company H flung out in skirmish line, marching over the open\r\nfields.\r\n\r\nPresently a boy in olive drab came panting and laughing up the hill. The\r\ngroup welcomed him with a shout. He was one of the billeting detail.\r\nThey had been staying in a house at the cross-roads. When the others had\r\ngone out this morning he had been left to clean up and get dinner. He\r\nhad washed all the dishes, he told us, and had just gone out and bought\r\na basketful of eggs to make an omelette for dinner, when crash! the\r\nfirst shell had fallen demolishing the house next to theirs. He had\r\nstepped out to look at the ruins and returned, when bang! went the house\r\non the other side of him! He began to think it might be time for him to\r\nmove, when, oh boy! zowie! a shell had wrecked the upper story of the\r\nbillet over him. Then he had left. But he was feeling very badly about\r\nthose eggs. Corporal G. also of the billeting detail looked at him with\r\nwidened eyes. “And I was half a mind to stay upstairs in bed and not get\r\nup this morning!” he remarked. The boys found solace for the loss of the\r\nomelette in the thought that all the effects of the very unpopular\r\ncaptain billeted next door must surely have been annihilated.\r\n\r\nAfter an hour or so the shelling stopped. One by one blue forms emerged\r\nfrom the dugouts. The Chief had ordered the flivver to report at eleven.\r\nIt was noon and it hadn’t appeared.\r\n\r\n“We must walk to Rattentout,” said the Chief. “No use our staying here.”\r\n\r\nIt was hot and dusty and my helmet weighed like a mountain on my head,\r\nbut at last we made it. Some two miles or so from Dugny we passed two\r\nmarines sitting in discouraged postures by the roadside.\r\n\r\n“What’s the matter?”\r\n\r\n“He’s had a fit,” growled one of the warriors, jerking his thumb in the\r\ndirection of his comrade’s back.\r\n\r\n“He has ’em. They never ought ter let him come.”\r\n\r\nThere was nothing we could offer them but sympathy.\r\n\r\n\r\nRattentout, March 17.\r\n\r\nHere I am sitting on a bench in the little garden back of our billet,\r\nsoaked in spring sunshine. Over my head the lilacs are leafing out\r\nagainst a sky of Italian blue, at my feet are golden crocuses and the\r\nfirst pale primroses. But the sky, as one gazes at it, has an odd trick\r\nof breaking out in little puffy dots of white like nothing so much as\r\nkernels of corn in a corn-popper. These are of course the bursting\r\nshells fired by French anti-aircraft batteries at the enemy aviators\r\noverhead; sometimes you can see the plane itself, skimming like a gnat\r\namong the smoke puffs. “They don’t seem to get ’em often,” as a boy\r\nremarked to me. “But golly they do make ’em move!”\r\n\r\nEver since the Americans began to arrive the German planes have been\r\nconstantly overhead. They are taking photographs; they say. Where, oh\r\nwhere are our American aviators?\r\n\r\nIn my ears as I sit here is a curious sound, a sound like the pounding\r\nof tremendous breakers on a stormy shore: it is the guns of Verdun, Les\r\nEparges and St. Mihiel. At rhythmic intervals this sound is punctuated\r\nby heavy crashing thuds nearer at hand. They are shelling Dugny again.\r\nAll the civilians fled yesterday. A driver, coming in last night, told\r\nus how they went, empty-handed, creeping along the edges of the roads\r\nunder the cover of trees or brush, fearing to step out in the open lest\r\nthey be spied and bombed by the German aeroplanes overhead. The church\r\nwhere they held the poilu’s funeral has already been struck by a shell\r\nand the steeple demolished.\r\n\r\nIn front of the house the street is quiet. All through the day the town\r\nseems a sleepy deserted place, but at night it is a different matter;\r\nthen the real business of the day begins. Carts and camions may straggle\r\npast at odd intervals during the daylight hours, but with darkness, the\r\ntraffic starts to pour by in a perfectly unbroken stream. One lies awake\r\nand listens, it seems for hours, to the absolutely incessant rattle of\r\ncarts, trucks, caissons and gun carriages passing along the road, until\r\nit seems as if the whole French Army must be on the move.\r\n\r\nLittle Pauline is better today. She has just come running into the\r\ngarden through the back gate, in company with a big curly dog.\r\nRattentout they tell us is the “Dog Town” for this sector; every dog\r\npicked up near the front, lost mascots, faithful beasts looking for\r\ntheir masters, strays of every sort, are sent back here for keeping.\r\n\r\nPresently I must go in and help M. get the supper. Our food, over and\r\nbeyond what we brought from Bar-le-Duc in tins and sacks, is furnished\r\nus by the French Army. Every morning a dapper little corporal calls to\r\ntake our orders. When the official interpreter is out it falls to me to\r\ndo the parleying. The corporal is patient and very military and oh so\r\npolite! He brings us fresh butter, fresh eggs, even so much as a quart\r\nof fresh milk, and the most delicious fresh French bread I have ever\r\ntasted. The first day he came he was dreadfully distressed; he had no\r\nfresh meat to offer us. This morning he shone with smiles. There was\r\nplenty of fresh beef now, plenty! We ordered some and ate it stewed for\r\ndinner. It was dark and tough and stringy. I could dare swear that I saw\r\nthat “beef” freshly slaughtered yesterday at Dugny cross-roads.\r\n\r\nA French _liaison_ officer called here this afternoon. He told me that\r\nit was quite true that a certain regiment of French infantry had gone\r\ninto battle, each man carrying with him the wooden cross which was to\r\nmark his grave if he fell. To earn _le croix de bois_ is the current\r\nslang phrase among the French to designate dying a soldier’s death.\r\n\r\nYesterday noon a detachment of marines arrived in Rattentout. During the\r\nday they must keep under cover, but last night after sundown they came\r\nout and played baseball in the street. When I looked out my window and\r\nsaw those lads in olive drab nonchalantly throwing and catching a\r\nbaseball under my window, I felt as if something safe and sane had\r\nsomehow appeared in the midst of a strange nightmare world.\r\n\r\n\r\nRattentout, March 18.\r\n\r\nI have said; “Good-bye, Good luck!” to my boys.\r\n\r\nToday we received word that the first battalion of my regiment was to\r\ntake its place in the trenches by Les Eparges at twelve o’clock tonight,\r\nleaving Genicourt where they have been billeted, at eight. I breathed a\r\npiteous appeal to the Chief. At five o’clock the car called for us.\r\n\r\nEarlier in the afternoon there had been an air battle over Genicourt. I\r\nheard the soft _whut_, _whut_ of the anti-aircraft guns, and later the\r\nstaccato rattle of machine-guns in the air. Looking out I could see the\r\nplanes, one German and two French darting among the shrapnel puffs, the\r\nGerman escaping, sad to say, unharmed. Now a French observation balloon\r\nwas floating over Genicourt, a curious-looking thing shaped like a huge\r\nram’s head, and a dull green in color. As we neared the town they\r\nstarted to haul the balloon in: it came down with astonishing rapidity.\r\n\r\nWe rolled into Genicourt, a sodden desolate village clinging under the\r\nlea of a low hill, just now alive with suppressed vitality. The boys had\r\nbeen ordered to keep their billets until the last moment, as any unusual\r\nnumber of men about might be observed by an enemy aeroplane.\r\nNevertheless there were plenty of stragglers in the streets, while out\r\nof the windows were leaning several hundred more, craning their necks in\r\norder to get a glimpse of the descending balloon.\r\n\r\nWe went to the _Foyer du Soldat_, a bright clean barracks, the walls\r\ncovered with posters in vivid hues. It was full of our boys. They\r\nlaughed, joked, played checkers and pounded the piano, some were dancing\r\ntogether. Yet through all the gaiety one had a sense of tension, of\r\nnervous strain. Some of the boys asked us to sing, one lad evidently in\r\na more solemn mood repeatedly requested “My Country ’Tis of Thee.” We\r\nsang the “Long, Long Trail” and “Keep the Home Fires Burning.” Then we\r\nwent out in the street again. The French, we gathered, were quite\r\nastonished at the high spirits of the Americans. “Ah, but it’s their\r\nfirst time,” they said. “After four years it will be different.”\r\n\r\nIn the public square they had been holding some sort of ceremony, an\r\ninterchange of formal greetings between the French and American\r\nofficers. A French military band had just finished its programme. As we\r\npassed they played the Marseillaise and the Star Spangled Banner; we all\r\nstood at attention.\r\n\r\nWe came to the street where Company A was billeted. The boys leaned out\r\nof the windows and waved and called to me. Everywhere it was the same\r\nquestion:\r\n\r\n“What shall I bring you from the trenches?”\r\n\r\n“Do you want a live Boche for a souvenir? I’ll get you one!” They\r\nthought my gas-mask was a lovely joke. “What’s that strap across your\r\nshoulder for?” they teased.\r\n\r\n“That? Oh that’s my new Sam Browne belt!”\r\n\r\n“Say! Bet you don’t know how to put it on!” Then they would yell “Gas!”\r\njust to frighten me.\r\n\r\nIn the street a little crowd of boys were tossing coppers. Everybody was\r\nanxious to get rid of his “clackers,” in order not to have to carry all\r\nthat useless weight into the trenches with him. They invited me to join.\r\nI tried one penny while the boys all cheered, only to miss by a good\r\nyard. Lieut. B. came by: “Will you take tea with me in my dugout?” he\r\nasked.\r\n\r\nThe order was given for the companies to form. The streets filled up;\r\ndusk was gathering. The Chief said that it was time to go. We found the\r\ncar in the public square. Slowly we moved out of town. I shall never\r\nforget those long brown files drawn up against the dim grey houses. Five\r\nhours hence and those very boys would be in the front line trenches,\r\nface to face with the enemy. We passed Company A. I called out to them\r\nto be sure not to stick their heads up over the top, and not to dare to\r\ntake off their gas-masks before they were ordered to. Never before did I\r\nrealize how much those boys meant to me. Each face I saw flashed some\r\nvivid unforgettable association to my mind. “When you come back,” I\r\ncalled, “I’ll be waiting for you with the hot chocolate ready.” They\r\nsmiled and waved Good-bye to me. Some of them held up their fingers to\r\nshow how many Germans they were going to account for. A turn in the road\r\nshut it all from sight. On the way back to Rattentout we passed the\r\nThird Battalion, who were marching in on their very heels to take over\r\ntheir billets.\r\n\r\nIt’s eleven o’clock now. They must be almost in. They are marching, I\r\nknow, in darkness and silence; not a cigarette is to be lighted, not a\r\nword spoken above a whisper. One hour more and the relief will be\r\ncompleted.\r\n\r\n\r\nRattentout, March 19.\r\n\r\nI am to be sent to Paris for reassignment. I have, it seems, been guilty\r\nof conduct unbecoming a lady under shell-fire. This sentence has been\r\nhanging over me ever since that day at Dugny. I knew of course that I\r\nwas in disgrace but never dreamed that it would come to this.\r\n\r\nIt seems, what no one had troubled to hint to me, that we have been\r\nallowed to go farther front than any women of any of the Allied Nations\r\nin France have been permitted to go to work before. Moreover that the\r\nFrench, whose guests we are in this sector, were very much opposed to\r\nthe presence of women here, and only finally, after much persuasion,\r\nallowed us to come here on trial. Now the Chief says that he is afraid\r\nthat my indiscreet action at Dugny in going down to the cross-roads\r\ninstead of into a dugout may have shocked the French. In order to\r\nforestall any possible protest by our Allies I am to be made an example\r\nof the discipline of the organization.\r\n\r\n\r\nEtretat, Normandy. March 28.\r\n\r\nI have been here a week on leave. Tomorrow I start back for Paris once\r\nmore. Where I am to go after that is uncertain.\r\n\r\nIt seems strange to be in France and not be wading through seas of mud,\r\nbut to have firm turf and dry roads beneath one’s feet. The hamlets\r\nhere, while picturesque, are quite spruce and tidy, amazingly different\r\nfrom the quaint but indescribably dirty little mudpie muck-heap villages\r\nto which I have been used.\r\n\r\nThis pretty little coast town, once a fishing village, then a summer\r\nresort, is now chiefly a hospital. All the large hotels have been taken\r\nover for wards and nurses’ quarters, the big casino filled with row on\r\nrow of iron cots. It is an American hospital with American doctors,\r\nnurses and orderlies, but attached to the B. E. F. and filled of course\r\nwith British patients. As in all the English hospitals, as soon as a\r\npatient is able to get out of bed he is dressed in a “suit of blues;”\r\ntrousers and jumper blouse of bright blue cotton, white shirt, scarlet\r\ntie and handkerchief to match, making him look exactly like a grown-up\r\nGreenaway boy. The men hate them, they tell me, but I for one am\r\ngrateful to the designer as the bright blue and scarlet makes wonderful\r\nsplotches of color in the landscape.\r\n\r\nThere may be a more disgusted set of boys in France than these here in\r\nthe hospital corps at Base No. 2, but if so I have yet to meet them. One\r\nof the first units to come across, landing in May of 1917, every man\r\nenlisted, so they tell me, because he thought it was the quickest means\r\nof getting to the front in field hospital service and most of them\r\nenlisted to do some form of specialized work; but, medical students,\r\ncollege professors, and motor experts, they each and all were given the\r\njob of hospital orderly which means scrubbing floors, washing windows,\r\nshovelling coal, doing the hard and dirty work of a hospital, and, most\r\ngalling I fancy of all,—taking orders from girls with whom you are not\r\nallowed to associate or even speak except in the line of business. The\r\nX-ray expert has been delegated to the job of keeping the hospital pigs.\r\nI saw him in a pair of grimy overalls trundling a well-worn wheelbarrow\r\ndown the street. The man who speaks eight languages, and enlisted as\r\ninterpreter, spends his days checking up clothes in the laundry. And\r\nhere as hospital orderlies in spite of their frantic efforts to get\r\ntransferred, it seems likely that they will stay.\r\n\r\nBut these are dark days for us all just now, with the news that comes in\r\nevery day of the German drive. “What do the officers in the hospital\r\nthink? What do they say about it?” I tease the nurses.\r\n\r\n“They think that we will hold them,” they reply, but none too hopefully.\r\n\r\nAt the hotel where I am staying there is a French officer _en\r\npermission_, with his wife and apparently unlimited offspring. With them\r\nis an English governess. She is a little nervous thing all a-twitter\r\nthese days with excitement and apprehension. Will the Germans get\r\nthrough to Paris? Monsieur’s aged mother is there. He is thinking of\r\ngoing back to get her, together with a few essential household\r\ntreasures. She herself had fled with the family from Paris in 1914. It\r\nwas a dreadful experience; fourteen people crowded in a coach for six,\r\nand nothing to eat. Oh dear! wasn’t it all just too terrible!\r\n\r\nThere is also an old French lady here who frankly fled from Paris to\r\nescape the air-raids; now someone has taken all the joy out of life for\r\nher by suggesting that Etretat might be shelled from the sea by a German\r\nsubmarine.\r\n\r\nThe Tommies in the hospitals, they say, flatly refuse to believe that\r\nParis is being shelled. It isn’t possible, they declare, for a gun to\r\nshoot as far as that, and to them that is the end of it. But tonight a\r\nlittle crowd of the hospital boys who had gone on pass to Paris came\r\nback as eye-witnesses. One of the first shells had fallen very close to\r\nthem, killing a number of people who were sitting drinking in a sidewalk\r\ncafé. The boys had gone up to the Church of Sacré Cœur on Montmartre and\r\nfrom the tower there had watched the shelling of the city. It had been a\r\nbeautiful clear day: they could see where each shell struck. One of the\r\nboys brought back with him for a souvenir a piece of a French\r\nlieutenant’s skull, picked up, after the shell had wrecked the café,\r\nfrom the sidewalk.\r\n\r\nTonight there was a concert at the Y hut here. The hall was crowded; the\r\nconcert party, a group of pretty girls, had just completed, to much\r\napplause, the first number, when a horn sounded in the distance.\r\nEverybody started up. The Y man stepped forward and announced the\r\nprogramme over. In a few minutes the hut was deserted. “The convoy is\r\nin,” they said, which meant that a train load of wounded had arrived at\r\nthe station.\r\n\r\n\r\nParis, Easter Sunday.\r\n\r\nOn the way here from Etretat I saw a sight which brought the war closer\r\nto me somehow than anything before; at the junction station connecting\r\nthe line to Le Havre with the line to Amiens, a string of box cars full\r\nof women, little children and decrepit old men, packed in like cattle,\r\nfleeing before the German drive, many of them empty-handed, others with\r\na few pathetic futile treasures, a hen or two, a copper cooking-pot,\r\nsnatched up evidently in a moment of half-witless panic haste.\r\n\r\nNor is Paris itself without its refugees. The German advance, the\r\nair-raids, the shelling, culminating in the Good Friday horror, have\r\ncombined to render the city half deserted.\r\n\r\n“Paris? We call Paris ‘the front’ now-a-days,” one Frenchman on the\r\njourney had remarked to me.\r\n\r\nYesterday I went shopping. Everywhere it was the same reply. Nothing\r\ncould be made to order for an indefinite period, the workrooms were all\r\ndeserted, the workers fled. As for those who remain, they seem to take\r\nlife calmly enough; what else can they do? When, as yesterday, every\r\nsixteen minutes a tremendous jarring crash tells you that a shell has\r\nfallen somewhere in the city,—and the concussion is so great that it\r\nalways sounds as if it had fallen in the next block!—you see people turn\r\ntheir heads as they walk, staring in the direction of the explosion;\r\nothers come out on the balconies to see what they can see and that is\r\nall.\r\n\r\nOf course the danger of all this lies in its effect on the civilian\r\nmorale. In connection with this I learned an interesting thing today.\r\nWhile the hospitals outside are overcrowded, the hospitals in Paris with\r\ntheir splendid equipment and staffs are left half empty, because they\r\ndare not show the people of Paris too many wounded. And when convoys are\r\nbrought into the city, they are often detained outside, sometimes for\r\nhours, in order that the wounded may be transferred to the hospitals at\r\nnight.\r\n\r\nYesterday at Brentano’s I got talking with a boy who belonged to the\r\nAmerican Ambulance Section which is attached to the French. He told me\r\nan incident which struck my fancy:\r\n\r\nOne night, at the front, after a hard day’s work, he had just dropped\r\noff to sleep when he was awakened. There was a _blessé_ to be taken back\r\nto the hospital, he was in bad shape, they had placed him in an\r\nambulance. The boy rolled out of his blankets, started up the car. It\r\nwas a bitter night. Once he was on his way everything went wrong; the\r\nwater had frozen in the radiator, he had to get out and crawl along the\r\nditches on his hands and knees, trying, in the dark to find a pool that\r\nwas still unfrozen. And all the while he was tortured by the thought\r\nthat the life of the wounded man in the car depended probably on his\r\nspeed in reaching the hospital, and this urged him to an agony of haste.\r\nFinally, as the dawn was breaking, he reached his goal. They came to\r\ncarry the blesse in. The wounded man was dead; he had been dead, it was\r\nevident, some while before the boy started. At the front, he explained,\r\nthey hate to take the time and trouble to bury bodies. So whenever it is\r\npossible they work this method of passing on the task to someone else.\r\nYou have to be constantly on the look-out for such tricks. This time\r\nthey had fooled him.\r\n\r\nLast night there was an air-raid. It was a mild affair. I was awakened\r\nby the sirens. They make what is to me quite the most fascinatingly\r\nhorrible sound I have ever heard. That long agonized wail, now sinking\r\nto a shuddering whimper, now rising to a banshee screech, flashes\r\nvividly to my mind’s eye a myriad little demons sitting on the roofs of\r\nParis, cowering, shivering, crying out their abject terror. I went to\r\nthe window and looked out, but although my room is on the top floor of\r\nthe hotel, I could see nothing and so went back to bed again. The\r\nanti-aircraft guns put up a tremendous barrage; they have them mounted\r\non trucks now so they can quickly be shifted from point to point about\r\nthe city. I am sure there was a whole battery just in front of the\r\nhotel. Today the papers inform us that the Gothas were driven back after\r\nreaching the suburbs.\r\n\r\nThis morning I went to service at Notre Dame, entering through piles of\r\nsand bags heaped so as to hide the carvings about the doorways. In that\r\nvast cathedral only a few were present, a fair share of the congregation\r\nbeing comprised of Americans.\r\n\r\nTonight an ambulance driver attached to one of the Paris hospitals came\r\nto the hotel for dinner. He spread a startling tale. Every ambulance in\r\nthe city has been ordered to be in readiness; for tomorrow, it has been\r\nlearned, twenty-seven long-range guns are to be turned at once on Paris!\r\n\r\n\r\nAix-les-Bains, April 6.\r\n\r\nWhen they said “Leave Area” to me my heart sank. The Lady in the Office\r\nexplained to me how very important she considered the work, and the\r\nassignment, she added, need not be permanent. “Very well” I said, “I’m\r\nwilling to go there temporarily.”\r\n\r\nI left Paris Tuesday, taking the night train. Getting off was something\r\nof an ordeal. The lighting at the stations, as on the streets, has been\r\nreduced almost to the vanishing point. The great Gare de Lyon was filled\r\nwith a mass of distraught humanity over whom the few violet-blue bulbs\r\ncast a ghostly glimmer. There were no porters to take one’s luggage; a\r\nnumber of women had possessed themselves of the baggage trucks and were\r\npushing them, heaped high with bags and household stuff, recklessly\r\nthrough the crowds. I could find no officials anywhere about. All the\r\nFrench orderliness and red tape seemed to have been swept clean away and\r\nthe result was chaos. Somehow, I don’t know quite how, I found my train\r\nand reached my seat.\r\n\r\nThree very fat old gentlemen and one old lady occupied the compartment\r\nwith me. The fat gentlemen had one little spoiled dog between them which\r\nthey kept passing from one to the other, in order that each in turn\r\nmight kiss him. The old lady had a bird in a cage; presently she opened\r\nher hand-bag and brought out her supper, a loaf of bread, unwrapped,\r\ntogether with a good-sized turtle. For a moment; such were her raptures\r\nover her pet, I thought that she was going to kiss the turtle. The first\r\nminute that one of my companions entered the compartment, each informed\r\nall the rest that he or she was _not_ running away from the air-raids or\r\nthe long range guns. “I? I am not afraid of the Kaiser’s Gothas! I laugh\r\nat them!” A few minutes later however they began: Ah, what a fearful\r\nnight, last night had been! Five hours in the _Caves_! No sleep at all!\r\nOne might as well be a mole and take up one’s dwelling underground. What\r\na life! Oh it was terrible, terrible! Then one old gentleman turned\r\nproudly to the little fat canine. “But of a verity, my little Toto is\r\npossessed of a sagacity extraordinary. The moment that he hears the\r\nsirens, he will run down into the cellar, and nothing can induce him to\r\ncome up again until the ‘all clear’ has sounded!”\r\n\r\nWe pulled into Aix soon after dawn as the rising sun was touching the\r\ntops of the mountains and the morning mists were hovering over the lake.\r\nWhatever the work may prove to be like here, the place is surpassingly\r\nlovely. It is too early for the summer resort pleasure seekers. The\r\nFrench don’t care for it here until it grows really hot, they tell us.\r\nBut to me the season is at its most appealing moment. One glimpses pink\r\npeach blossoms against the blue lake over which stand purple mountains\r\nwith snow still lying on their summits. Several of the large hotels and\r\ncasinos have been requisitioned for French convalescent hospitals, but\r\nthe largest of all has been taken over by the Y. From this canteen\r\nexcursions are constantly setting out, motor-boats on the lake, motor\r\ncars to Chambery, the cog-wheel railway up Mt. Revard, picnics, hikes\r\nand fishing parties, yet many of the boys seem to find it pleasantest to\r\ndo nothing,—just to sit around in lazy comfort all day long, watching\r\nthe others playing billiards, listening to the orchestra in the\r\nafternoon Beneath the gold mosaic casino dome, sitting luxuriously in a\r\nbox at the vaudeville in the evening, gaining a maximum of pleasure with\r\na minimum of exertion. Many of the boys came here with their heads full\r\nof pessimistic expectations.\r\n\r\n“They told us it would be Reveille and Retreat and one day’s K. P. for\r\neach of us,” confided one lad to me.\r\n\r\nSome brought their mess-kits and some even their blankets. When they\r\nfind themselves guests in hotels that are among the finest in Europe,\r\nlodged in comfortable rooms, eating real food off tables furnished with\r\nchina-ware and linen, at first they are fairly dazed.\r\n\r\n“I’m feared somebody’ll pinch me an’ I’ll wake up,” declared one lad\r\ntoday.\r\n\r\nMore than one has told me, that the first night he got here, he could\r\nnot go to sleep in bed at all and only finally achieved slumber by\r\nrolling himself in blankets on the floor.\r\n\r\nThere are no troops from the line here at present; only boys from\r\nforestry regiments, motor mechanics and a few lads from medical\r\ndetachments. They are holding up the leaves of all combatant troops on\r\naccount of the drive. It may be that presently they will hold up all\r\nleaves altogether. Then we will have to shut up shop here temporarily.\r\n\r\nIt is the pleasant custom here for the Y ladies to go down to the train\r\nevery night to see the boys off.\r\n\r\n“It’s a shame you can’t stay longer,” we say to them.\r\n\r\n“I’ll say it is!”\r\n\r\n“I’m awfully sorry you have to go.”\r\n\r\n“You ain’t half so sorry as I am, Lady.”\r\n\r\n“Maybe some day you’ll be coming back again.”\r\n\r\n“I’ll tell the world one thing; I’m going to be good as gold when I get\r\nback to camp, so they’ll let me.”\r\n\r\nOne of the Y women tonight repeated what one boy on leaving had confided\r\nto her:\r\n\r\n“If I said to you that this had been my happiest week since I joined the\r\narmy it wouldn’t mean much,” he told her, “but that’s not what I’m going\r\nto say. What I’m going to say is that this has been the happiest week of\r\nall my life.”\r\n\r\nSo far I have found just one man who wasn’t enjoying himself here. He\r\nhad been stationed for six months at Paris. Aix, he declared, “Weren’t\r\nno town at all, nothin’ but a one-horse place.” He evidently had no soul\r\nfor the beauties of nature.\r\n\r\n\r\nParis, April 22.\r\n\r\nThey held the leaves up. The boys kept leaving; fewer and fewer came,\r\nthen finally none. Last week they disbanded the force of workers at Aix;\r\na few stayed to look after things until such time as the crowds should\r\nstart to pour in again; the rest were sent back to Paris to be\r\nreassigned.\r\n\r\nIf I thought the trip down was a chore, it wasn’t a patch on the trip\r\nback. We waited half the night for the train at the Aix railway station.\r\nWhen it finally pulled in, I found my seat was in a compartment which\r\nwas full, and had evidently been so for hours, of French people. Now\r\nlife in France tends to cure you of belief in several popular\r\nsuperstitions; one is the idea that it is dangerous to have wet feet,\r\nand another that there is anything in the germ theory; but there is one\r\nnotion to which I still cling, an obstinate belief in the desirability\r\nof fresh air. I put my head in the compartment, then withdrew, shutting\r\nthe door. For the twelve hours it took to reach Paris I stood up outside\r\nin the corridor.\r\n\r\nArrived in Paris, they assigned me temporarily to the Avenue Montaigne\r\nClub House. This is a beautiful building, the home of one of Napoleon’s\r\ngenerals; but the best thing about it is the tea-room restaurant, for\r\nhere they serve apple-pie, chocolate cake and ice-cream. Since the\r\nlatest food restrictions were issued, forbidding the French to make\r\ndesserts employing milk, cream, sugar, eggs or flour, such dainties have\r\nbeen unobtainable anywhere else in Paris; but the Americans drawing\r\nsupplies from their own commissary, are of course untouched by such\r\nregulations. Indeed the saddest sign in France these days I often think\r\nis that over the deserted shops which reads _Patisserie_. To be sure\r\nsome of these stores still make a show at doing business, filling their\r\nwindows with raisins, dried prunes and other prosaic edibles, together\r\nwith heaps of pseudo-chocolates wrapped gayly in tin-foil, but which\r\nwhen purchased proved to be nothing but what one boy termed “the same\r\nold camouflage,”—an unappetizing paste of dried fruits and ground nuts.\r\nYesterday a curly-headed lad, who looked about sixteen, came into the\r\ncanteen carrying a big bunch of pink carnations. These were for the\r\nwaitresses, he said, because they were the first American ladies that he\r\nhad seen in France. We each pinned a spray to the front of our pink\r\naprons, and then, since he pretended famine, let him have\r\n“seconds”,—quite against the rules—on everything, with all the ice-cream\r\nand cake that he could swallow.\r\n\r\nYesterday I saw Mr. T. who was with us for a while at Goncourt. He told\r\nme that French troops _en repos_ were occupying that area at present.\r\nThey had asked for the use of our hut and of course it had been granted\r\nthem. A Y man, happening by the other day, had stopped in. They had\r\nconverted our beautiful hut into a regular French _Cantine_ with three\r\nmen to hand the bottles over the counter “and a smell enough to knock\r\nyou down.” Who shall say that this is the least of life’s little\r\nironies?\r\n\r\nThis morning I met N. who had reached Rattentout the day I left. She\r\ntells me that all the villages occupied by our troops in the sector\r\nhave, one by one, been shelled. Rattentout was shelled and two\r\nFrenchwomen killed. Because of the constant shelling all the Y women\r\nworkers had been withdrawn from the canteens and sent back to safety at\r\nSouilly where they have nothing to do but sit and possess their souls in\r\npatience.\r\n\r\nTonight they gave me my new assignment. It is at Gondrecourt. I leave\r\ntomorrow. I am glad, so glad over the prospect of being back on a real\r\njob once more! Here at the Avenue Montaigne as in the gilded casino at\r\nAix I have been desperately homesick, to be back in a real hut again!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IV: GONDRECOURT—THE ARTILLERY\r\n\r\n\r\nGondrecourt, April 28.\r\n\r\nGondrecourt is quite a place. It boasts a brewery, a hotel, a mediœval\r\ntower and a number of little stores. Each one of these stores contains\r\nat least one pretty girl on its selling force and the ratio between the\r\nsales of goods and the charms of the ladies is, I fancy, quite exact.\r\nFrom the military point of view Gondrecourt is important as being the\r\nsite of the First Army Corps Training Schools. But to me the really\r\ndistinguishing feature of Gondrecourt is the fact that it boasts a\r\nbath-tub. If anybody had said bath-tub to me the day before I arrived\r\nhere, I would have said with the doughboy that,—short of Paris—“there\r\nain’t no such animal.” But now I have beheld it with my own eyes, a\r\nwhite-enamelled bath-tub, a Y. M. C. A. bath-tub, in the basement at\r\nHeadquarters. The tub is supposed to be a strictly family affair,—on the\r\ndoor are posted hours for the Lady Secretaries and hours for the Men\r\nSecretaries,—but in spite of the plain English before their eyes, it\r\nseems that army officers occasionally slip in and steal a bath off us,\r\nyes, even impinging on the sacred bath hours of the ladies!\r\n\r\nMy first day here they sent me to “The Café.” This was once a very wild\r\nplace indeed. When the Y. first came to Gondrecourt it tried to buy the\r\nproprietor out, but the proprietor refused; he was doing too profitable\r\na business. Then one night Providence sent some Boche planes wandering\r\nin this direction. There was a panic among the populace; the proprietor,\r\nwith visions of his place wrecked by a bomb, sold out in a hurry and\r\nleft town. Since then the Cafe has led a reformed and decorous existence\r\nbut the old name still clings. My second day I spent at the “Double\r\nHut,” the big hut built up on the hill close by the Infantry School. The\r\nthird day I was introduced to my own canteen.\r\n\r\nAccording to directions, I climbed the hill by my billet, went past the\r\nathletic field, past the warehouse and out along the edge of the rolling\r\nopen upland. About half a mile out of town I came to a group of seven\r\nFrench barracks, covered with black tar paper, built at the edge of the\r\nrailway cut. This was the Artillery School. I crossed the field, entered\r\nthe nearest barracks which bore a Y. sign at one end, and found myself\r\nin a Greenwich Village Tea House. I stood and stared. Some modern-school\r\ninterior decorator had been at work. The place was a riot of red,\r\nyellow, salmon-color and black, worked out from a nasturtium motif. In\r\nthe wall panels were paintings, some conventionalized fruits and\r\nflowers, evidently done by the decorator; others, landscapes, Japanese\r\nscenes and some rather awful Indians just as evidently executed by the\r\nboys. The whole effect to be sure was a bit sketchy and in spots frankly\r\nunfinished, and yet to one used to such simplicity in the huts as I, the\r\n_ensemble_ was startling. Back of the black and orange partition which\r\nscreens the canteen and the kitchen from the hut proper, I found the\r\nstaff, secretary and canteen worker. The lady whom I am to replace, it\r\nappears, belongs in reality to the Motor Transport Section. She turned\r\ncanteen worker to help out in a pinch, and now is anxious to return\r\nagain.\r\n\r\nWhen dinnertime came the Motor Transport girl told me that we had been\r\ninvited to dine at the camp. We went over to the mess-hall. “Let’s help\r\nfeed the chow-line for a lark!” said the M. T. girl. So we stood behind\r\nthe serving-bench and ladled out big spoonfuls of mashed potato and\r\ngravy. This amused the boys immensely; and as they passed they would\r\nsing out:\r\n\r\n“When did they put _you_ on K. P?”\r\n\r\n“What have _you_ done to deserve this?”\r\n\r\nThe kitchen was white-washed and specklessly clean, the earth floor was\r\ncovered with cinders. These cinders which are in use for floors and\r\nwalks in all the camps about, come, I am told, from a great heap down by\r\nthe river which marks the site of one of Napoleon’s cannon foundries.\r\n\r\n“Why are the boxers in a company always found on the kitchen force?” I\r\nasked one of the cooks.\r\n\r\n“That’s so they can handle the boys when they come back for seconds.”\r\n\r\nAs soon as the chow-line had been fed, the M. T. girl and I had ours\r\nwith the Top Sergeant. After dinner the Top Sergeant, who had formerly\r\nbeen mess sergeant, was moved to unburden his soul as to the sorrows of\r\na mess sergeant.\r\n\r\n“When I was mess sergeant,” he reminisced, “I sure got to know the way\r\nto a man’s heart all right. Why, the days when I gave them a good dinner\r\nthere wasn’t a man in camp who wouldn’t positively beam at me; but if\r\nsomething had gone wrong and the chow wasn’t up to scratch, half the\r\nfellers in the company wouldn’t speak to me the rest of the day.”\r\n\r\nThen he grinned. “I wouldn’t want Mother to know the way I used to get\r\nstuff for the boys last winter.”\r\n\r\nHe went on to tell us. French freight trains have no brakemen and the\r\nconductor rides in a caboose directly behind the coal car. Trains\r\npulling into town from the north hit a grade curve close to the camp, up\r\nwhich they must pull very slowly. The camp guard kept a lookout; when a\r\nfreight train with flat cars was sighted, word was immediately passed to\r\nthe mess sergeant who with a number of K. P.s hurried to the tracks and\r\nboarded the slow-moving train; if the cars proved to hold anything of\r\nvalue for the mess,—be it coal or cabbages,—all the way up the grade the\r\nsergeant and his assistants were busy, hastily throwing or shoveling\r\nwhat they could over the sides of the cars. At the top of the grade they\r\nwould jump off and returning along the tracks, gather up the spoils.\r\n\r\nTomorrow the Motor Transport girl departs and I “take over” the canteen.\r\n\r\n\r\nGondrecourt, May 4.\r\n\r\nThe Artillery School consists of some few hundred officers and non-coms\r\nenrolled for each four-weeks’ course, in addition to the two batteries\r\nwho are here for demonstration work; Battery D from a regiment of “75s”\r\nand Battery A from a regiment of the big “155s.” Selected for this\r\nexhibition work on account of their exceptional ability, they are, I\r\nsuppose, the equal of any batteries in the world. When the boys enlisted\r\nthese batteries were declared to be about to be “motorized,” but at\r\npresent the motor power is being supplied by a particularly unresponsive\r\nset of French cart horses, whose daily care is the greatest trial of the\r\nboys’ lives. Last night we had a movie-show; one reel gave the story of\r\na discontented boy on the farm—showing him at one moment disgustedly\r\ngrooming Dobbin. For a full minute it seemed as if the roof of the hut\r\nwas going to be lifted right off.\r\n\r\nThe officers’ quarters and the class-rooms lie across the railroad track\r\nfrom the camp, in the grounds of the Château. Here they have a canteen\r\nof their own, a cool little place in cream color and blue presided over\r\nby a most refreshing and delightful English lady. The Château itself was\r\npartially destroyed by fire a few years ago and though the lower story\r\nis available for offices, the upper story stands roofless, with empty\r\nwindows staring against the sky. Every now and then a rumour goes the\r\nrounds:—Pershing is going to move his headquarters to Gondrecourt,—the\r\nChâteau is to be repaired for his use! The Château and the school\r\nbuildings stand on high ground. To the south the ground falls away\r\nsuddenly; below is “off limits” and is Fairyland. Here are meadows warm\r\nwith the color of spring flowers, here are groves such as one sees in\r\nthe pictures of Eighteenth Century shepherds and shepherdesses, and here\r\nis the river flowing so placidly that its waters seem to form still\r\nlagoons, white-flecked with swans and arched with rustic bridges. Here\r\nwhile the boys are at their mess, I have been stealing to eat my picnic\r\nsupper; an orange, a sandwich and a piece of chocolate. The guard\r\nwalking post at the foot of the embankment shuts one eye as I go\r\npast,—and usually gets half of my supper! For that matter I gather he is\r\nthere largely for the sake of appearance, for there’s not a boy in camp\r\nI’m sure who hasn’t explored those groves, fed the swans, and angled for\r\nfish in the river. And the only reason, I’m certain, that they don’t\r\nsurreptitiously go in swimming there is that the water, fed by springs,\r\nis cold as ice! Nor is the touch of romance that should go with such a\r\nsetting absent. One of the cooks in the officers’ mess kitchen is deep\r\nin an affair with Lucile, the caretaker’s daughter, a girl like a wild\r\nrose, shy, slender, freshly-tinted. Every other night when he is off\r\nduty he carries her chocolate from the canteen and she “gives him a\r\nFrench lesson.”\r\n\r\n“Serious?” I asked inquisitively.\r\n\r\n“Fat chance!” he glowered at me frankly. “She tells me that she’s\r\nengaged to twelve fellows now already and that twelve’s enough.”\r\n\r\nThe proprietor of the Château, Monsieur S., has the distinction of being\r\nthe father of ten girls. I like to fancy that the spirits of the ten\r\nlovely daughters,—for lovely they must be, as no Frenchman, I am sure,\r\nwould have the courage to father ten homely ones!—haunt the Château\r\ngardens.\r\n\r\nThe boys, however, don’t have to rely on phantoms for thrills of this\r\nsort. Yesterday, they tell me, that during the progress of an exciting\r\nball-game on the Y. athletic field a beautiful lady dressed _à la\r\nParisienne_ strolled by. The batter dropped his bat, the pitcher forgot\r\nhis ball; the game came to a dead halt until the beautiful lady had\r\npassed out of sight.\r\n\r\n\r\nGondrecourt, May 13.\r\n\r\nThe Secretary is sick. He lies in his little bed-room office and reads\r\nthe latest magazines and gossips with his visitors while I attempt to\r\nrun the hut single-handed. At times during this last week I have been\r\nstrongly tempted to get sick myself. Indeed I think I probably would\r\nhave done so if it hadn’t been for Snow. Snow, Snowball or Ivory as he\r\nis variously called, is Battery D’s albino cook. “Say, ain’t I the\r\nwhitest-haired beggar you ever did see?” he asked me the other day in a\r\nsort of naive wonder at himself. “Anyway, nobody ever had a\r\ncleaner-looking cook,” remarked the Top Sergeant, ex-Mess Sergeant. Snow\r\nhas the sweetest disposition in the world. “If Snow was starving to\r\ndeath,” declared one of the boys to me today, “and somebody gave him a\r\nsandwich, and he thought you were the least bit hungry, he’d give you\r\nthat sandwich.” Ever since the Secretary has been sick, Snow has been\r\nbringing him toast and eggs and things while he has brought me lemon\r\npies, the most wonderful lemon pies that ever I tasted. Already Snow has\r\ncome to be looked upon by the boys as an authority on all things\r\npertaining to the canteen and has to stand a battery of searching\r\nquestions, such as, whether he thinks that my hair is really all my own?\r\n\r\nJust to add to all our other troubles this week we have run amuck of the\r\nMajor. This I suspect was all my fault. I was furious because when he\r\ncame into the hut he made the boys stand at attention. This was\r\nsomething I had never seen done before and is, I am sure, contrary to\r\nall the rules. I was so angry that when the Major came up to the counter\r\nI stood and glared at him.\r\n\r\n“You will find the Secretary in his office,” I said and turned and\r\nwalked out the back door. It was the Major’s turn to be angry then. He\r\nstalked out behind the counter, looking for trouble, and began to hold\r\nan inspection in the kitchen. The Secretary appeared, the Major let\r\nloose. That kitchen, he declared, was not up to army standards in\r\ncleanliness. This was a matter of utmost importance. Hereafter the\r\nmedical officer would inspect the kitchen daily. Then he proceeded to\r\nprescribe a schedule of canteen hours outside of which nothing at all\r\nmust be sold.\r\n\r\nNow I admit that kitchen hasn’t been quite all it might be. It is a\r\nsmall, overcrowded place, built of rough dirty boards and there are no\r\nshelves, nor of course running water, nor conveniences of any kind.\r\nMoreover, the Major, I learn, has the reputation of being a tartar in\r\nthis respect; “Major Mess Kit” they call him because of the rigour of\r\nhis inspections.\r\n\r\nThe next morning the medical officer arrived at the crack of dawn. He\r\nfound the chocolate cups from the night before unwashed. He was shocked.\r\nHe too read the Secretary a lecture. Then he departed to do the\r\nsensible, the saving thing, which was to recommend to the Major that we\r\nbe allowed a detail. So it all worked out for the best in the end.\r\n“Neddy” as we have christened the detail is now a part of the family. A\r\nshy, dreamy lad, he is at hand to help from early morning until closing\r\ntime at nine at night, and I actually have to shoo him out to his meals.\r\nThe only trouble with Neddy is that he is so good I am sure that he is\r\ngoing to die young. And besides Neddy I now have a pet bugaboo. This has\r\nproved so useful these last few days that I don’t know how I ever kept a\r\ncanteen without one. Now any time that officers come to my kitchen door\r\nto tease for cigarettes out of selling hours I can gleefully tell them:\r\n\r\n“Oh, but I wouldn’t dare! The Major, you know! He’s expressly forbidden\r\nit! If I did and he learned about it, he would surely have me\r\ncourt-martialed!”\r\n\r\nOf course when the boys come out of hours that is quite a different\r\nmatter.\r\n\r\nThen, too, as the Major is detested by the men, this furnishes a common\r\nbond of sympathy. This morning a boy came to my back door to borrow our\r\naxe in order to chop up the Major’s wood.\r\n\r\n“You can have it on one condition,” I told him.\r\n\r\n“What’s that?”\r\n\r\n“That you chop off the Major’s head with it too.”\r\n\r\n\r\nGondrecourt, May 24.\r\n\r\nI have always cherished a secret longing to have pets in my canteen: I\r\nhave heard of huts that kept kittens and canaries, and once I visited in\r\none where an ant-eater, if not an _habitué_, was at least a frequent and\r\nhonoured guest and sat in the ladies’ laps at the movie-shows. At\r\nvarious times I have considered and regretfully abandoned the project of\r\nrabbits, a puppy, goldfish and a goat. But till recently the nearest I\r\nhave come to realizing my dreams was when I found two large snails with\r\nblack and yellow shells by the roadside. I carried them into the canteen\r\nand set them on a flowering branch in a vase. For two days the boys took\r\na casual interest. They nicknamed them Bill and Daisy.\r\n\r\n“The French eat snails you know,” I told them.\r\n\r\n“You don’t say!”\r\n\r\n“Yes and I had some myself the other day.”\r\n\r\n“Aw shucks! You didn’t _really_, did you? Why, before I’d eat them\r\nthings! Say, what did they taste like anyway?”\r\n\r\n“They would have tasted pretty good,” I answered, “if only while you\r\nwere eating them you could have stopped thinking what they were!”\r\n\r\nOne boy staring at my pets asked innocently;\r\n\r\n“Will butterflies come but of those?”\r\n\r\nAfter the snails our only livestock for a while was the canteen rat,\r\nwhom I have never met myself, but of whom I have heard large rumours.\r\nThe other day however I received a present of two real pets. One of the\r\nY. drivers had been out to a wood-cutting camp in the forest. There an\r\nItalian lad had given him two young birds in a beautiful cage he had\r\nmade himself with nothing but a pen-knife and a hot wire, and the driver\r\nbrought the birds to me. I don’t know what sort they were but they were\r\ntame and most amusing. To feed them was the immediate question. I asked\r\nthe boys to dig me some earth worms, but this they seemed to consider\r\nbeneath their dignity. Finally Neddy went out with a can, only to return\r\nwormless. He couldn’t find any, he declared. I considered the\r\nadvisability of asking the Top Sergeant for a worm-digging detail, but\r\ndecided against it. Then I confided my troubles to my friend, the\r\nWarehouse Man.\r\n\r\n“I know,” he said, “I’ll ask Pierre.”\r\n\r\nNow Pierre is a little orphan refugee from the devastated district. He\r\nlives with one of the families on the edge of the town and I am afraid\r\nis none too well treated. When he isn’t herding the cows over the\r\nmeadows, he is usually hanging about the warehouse. A handsome, rather\r\nwild looking lad, dressed in a brown cap and an old brown suit, I always\r\nthink of him as Peter Pan. The next morning Pierre appeared at my\r\nkitchen door with a can full of long fat wriggly angleworms and had his\r\npockets filled with chocolate by way of recompense. Later I learned that\r\nthe Warehouse Man, not being able to pronounce the French word for\r\nbirds, had told Pierre that I wanted the worms for fishing, and Pierre\r\nafter taking one look at the bird-cage had gone straight back and told\r\nthe Warehouse Man that he was a liar. But cunning as my pets were, I\r\ncouldn’t quite reconcile myself to the idea of keeping wild birds in a\r\ncage. This morning I looked at Neddy:\r\n\r\n“Let’s let them out.”\r\n\r\n“Let’s,” he answered.\r\n\r\nNow the only pet I have in prospect is the baby wild boar which a boy\r\nfrom one of the aviation camps nearby has promised me.\r\n\r\n\r\nGondrecourt, June 2.\r\n\r\nNight before last, at half-past ten, as I was sitting here in my billet\r\ntrying to write a letter, I heard a voice calling me from the street\r\nbelow.\r\n\r\n“What is it?”\r\n\r\n“It’s Sergeant B——. I’ve brought you a gas-mask.”\r\n\r\n“What!”\r\n\r\n“There’s a bunch of German planes headed in this direction. They’re\r\nafraid of gas bombs. We got the alarm out at the school.”\r\n\r\nI went down to the door. The sergeant gave me two gas-masks. I gave one\r\nto the English lady who has the room across the hall from me. Then I sat\r\nup waiting for the fun to begin. Nothing happened. I went to sleep with\r\nthe gas-mask lying on the pillow beside me.\r\n\r\nThe next morning the Chief declared that all the Y. personnel here must\r\ngo to gas drill and have masks issued to them. Last night they rounded\r\nus up for a lesson. We stood in a big circle at the Gas School over on\r\nthe hill while the gas instructors instructed us and the boys looked on\r\nand grinned. Gas drill consists of learning how to put on and take off\r\nyour mask in the prescribed and formal manner. It is all done by count.\r\nIf you can’t do it in six seconds you are a casualty. As we popped our\r\nmasks on and pulled them off again the hair of all the ladies present\r\nproceeded to slowly but relentlessly fall down their backs. The English\r\nLady stood next to me. “It’s all stuff and nonsense,” I could hear her\r\nmuttering; “stuff and nonsense!”\r\n\r\nThe noncom instructors walked around and informed each and all of us\r\nthat if we didn’t change the style of our coiffures we certainly would\r\nget gassed.\r\n\r\n“And now,” said the instructor cheerfully, “I am going to send you\r\nthrough the gas-house.”\r\n\r\nI looked desperately for a chance to sneak away, but there wasn’t any;\r\nbesides, several boys from my batteries were watching.\r\n\r\n“Oh this is nothing, nothing at all,” declared the instructor. “We’ve\r\nonly got the tear gas on tonight. You will go through once with your\r\nmasks on, and then a second time without them.” We put our masks on and\r\nmarched in a long line into the gas-house. There was a table in the\r\nmiddle with candles burning on it, which gleamed golden through the\r\nthick yellowish clouds of gas. We marched around the table and out\r\nagain. There was nothing to it; the masks were a perfect protection.\r\n\r\n“Now,” said the instructor,” you will go through without your masks.\r\nThis is to give you confidence in them.” The idea being that discovering\r\nhow very nasty it was without one, you would be taught to appreciate the\r\nblessing of a mask. I had an inspiration. I would shut my eyes and hang\r\non to the man in front of me! But alas, for my pretty plan, the line was\r\ntoo long; as I was about to enter: “Break the line here!” shouted the\r\ninstructor. I had to lead the second line into the gas house. I made\r\ndouble-quick time around that table. Just as I was about to dart out the\r\ndoor an English noncom instructor seized my arm and, halting me, started\r\nto explain something.\r\n\r\n“Yes, yes,” I choked. “It’s all very interesting, but I don’t feel like\r\nstopping now!” I pulled away and made a break out the door. I was\r\nweeping horribly. My eyes felt as if someone had rubbed onion juice on\r\nthem. They stung and burned for hours afterward.\r\n\r\n“The next time,” said the instructor genially, “we’ll put you through\r\nthe mustard gas.”\r\n\r\nNow in the mustard gas lesson a fellow must walk into the gas-house\r\nwithout his mask, and put it on after he has entered. If he fails to\r\nhold his breath long enough, or is nervous and clumsy and so doesn’t get\r\nhis mask on quickly enough, why it means a trip to the hospital for him.\r\nThe mustard gas test is an ordeal which causes the boys considerable\r\napprehension.\r\n\r\n“Oh thank you! You’re very kind,” I said.\r\n\r\nAs we took our departure down the hill I noticed a darky doughboy in a\r\ngroup who were drilling. He was in an awful fix; every time he tried to\r\nfasten the nose-clip on his nostrils, it would slip right off again!\r\n\r\nWhen the next lesson is held I have decided to be among the missing.\r\n\r\n\r\nGondrecourt June 9.\r\n\r\nWe have a new detail. His name is Jones. About six weeks ago he was\r\nkicked by a mule and had three of his ribs broken. He was sent to the\r\nhospital at Neufchateau. Learning that there was a chance that his\r\nbattery might be sent to the front shortly, he pestered the docters\r\nuntil they let him go, his besetting fear being that he might become\r\nseparated from his outfit. He returned three days ago. The next day he\r\nwent out on the range as one of a gun crew. Yesterday he came into the\r\nhut and collapsed. The Secretary put him on his bed where he spent the\r\nrest of the day. Moved by purely altruistic motives, the Secretary then\r\nwent to his captain and asked that Jones be assigned to the Y. as a\r\nsupplementary detail. Now this is very nice for Jones, but I am not so\r\nsure whether it is nice for the Y. Jones, it seems, goes by the nickname\r\nof “Mildred.” At one period of his past life he was engaged in selling\r\nsoap, a fact which inspires the boys to shout at frequent intervals:\r\n“Three cheers for Jones! Soap! Soap! Soap!” He brings echoes of his\r\ncommercial training to the canteen counter. No east-side shopkeeper was\r\never more anxious to make sales than he. If a boy asks for tooth-paste\r\nwhen we happen to be out of it, he is sure to answer:\r\n\r\n“No, but we have some very fine shoe polish.”\r\n\r\nOr if somebody wants talcum powder when talcum there is none:\r\n\r\n“I’m sorry we’re out of it today, but can’t I interest you in some\r\ntomato ketchup?”\r\n\r\nSome day I think I shall write on essay on the psychology of suggestion\r\nas demonstrated in canteen sales. Nothing, it seems, ever really wins\r\nthe boys’ approval unless it bears the label; “Made in the U. S.\r\nA.”—nothing that is, with the possible exception of eggs. Anything\r\noriginating in Europe, from mustard to matches, is looked upon with a\r\ncertain amount of suspicion, while goods coming from America are hailed\r\nwith an enthusiasm often quite inconsistent with their quality. The\r\nother day we put a case of “Fig Newtons” on sale. The news flashed all\r\nover town. As one of the boys said; “Why it was just as if General\r\nPershing or somebody’s mother had come to camp.”\r\n\r\nLately we have had for sale quantities of fat French cookies. Some of\r\nthe boys are mean enough to suggest that these were baked before the\r\nwar.\r\n\r\n“Those cookies ought to wear service stripes,” one boy declared.\r\n\r\nSo “Service Stripe Cookies” they have been ever since.\r\n\r\n“They’re all right for eating,” observed another customer solemnly, “but\r\nthe Lord help you if you drop one on your toe!” This morning when I\r\nreached the hut I found Jones languidly washing dishes.\r\n\r\n“Where’s Neddy?”\r\n\r\n“Neddy? Why he’s in the guard-house.”\r\n\r\nFor a moment I was goose enough to believe it, then I learned that\r\nNeddy, with a lieutenant and some twenty other boys, had all gone off,\r\nthe day being Sunday, on single mounts to Domremy to visit the\r\nbirthplace of Jeanne D’Arc. Late in the afternoon the little cavalcade\r\nreturned.\r\n\r\n“Neddy,” I teased, “I hear you’ve been in the guard-house.”\r\n\r\nTo my astonishment Neddy’s mouth twitched, his eyes filled. “I wish I’d\r\nnever gone!” he blurted out.\r\n\r\n“Why, what’s the matter?”\r\n\r\nThen the whole pitiful tale was unfolded. Neddy hadn’t any money, not a\r\nclacker, and being too shy to ask for a loan, he had gone on the trip\r\nwith empty pockets. He hadn’t been able to buy himself a bite of dinner.\r\nBut that wasn’t what hurt. What hurt was that he couldn’t purchase any\r\nsouvenirs for his girl, and there had been so many enticing ones!\r\n\r\n“Gee,” he moaned, “but that’s an awful place for a feller to go who\r\nhasn’t any money.”\r\n\r\nThen, just as the last straw of misery, his horse had been taken sick on\r\nthe way home!\r\n\r\nWe are going through one of those painful periods of pecuniary depletion\r\nwhich are periodic in the army, the inevitable prelude to payday. In\r\nBattery A there are two lads whom I have privately dubbed Tweedledum and\r\nTweedledee. They are both short, roly-poly and always smiling and they\r\nare absolutely inseparable. When either of them buys anything at the\r\ncanteen he always buys double; two packets of cigarettes, two “bunches”\r\nof gum, two cups of hot chocolate “one for me and one for my friend” as\r\nthe stock phrase goes. This morning I received a shock. Tweedledum asked\r\nfor _one_ bar of chocolate and _one_ package of cigarettes.\r\n\r\n“What’s the matter?” I asked, thinking alarmedly of how in the immortal\r\npoem “Tweedledum and Tweedledee agreed to have a battle,”—“You and your\r\nbuddy haven’t quarrelled, have you?”\r\n\r\n“No ma’am, oh no indeed ma’am! It’s just that it’s an awful long ways\r\nfrom payday!”\r\n\r\nLater I saw them carefully dividing the purchases between them. I leaned\r\nover the counter, beckoned to Tweedledee.\r\n\r\n“You boys go around to the back door, but don’t let anybody see you!”\r\n\r\nAt the back door I gave them each a slice of Snow’s latest lemon pie.\r\n\r\nTonight the Major suddenly made his appearance in the kitchen to find\r\nSnow, Neddy and myself all sitting on the floor sorting out rotten\r\noranges. Snow and Neddy faded away out the back door, but I stood my\r\nground. For once his Majorship was pleased to be gracious. He\r\ncomplimented me on the improvement in the appearance of my kitchen.\r\nIndeed we did look pretty fine, Neddy having just covered the shelves\r\nwith newspapers whose edges he had cut into beautiful fancy scalloping.\r\n\r\n“What do you do with those over-ripe oranges?”\r\n\r\n“Put them in a box outside the back door.”\r\n\r\n“Well? What then?”\r\n\r\n“The French children do the rest, sir.”\r\n\r\nBut the boys are more incensed than ever against the Powers That Be.\r\nThey have been writing too many letters of late for the censor’s\r\ncomfort. So yesterday at Retreat the order was read out that no boy\r\nmight write more than two letters and one postal card per week!\r\n\r\n\r\nGondrecourt, June 13.\r\n\r\nThe School has closed. It is common knowledge that the two batteries\r\nwill soon join their respective regiments at the front. Curiously\r\nenough, here with the artillery I have never had that same feeling of\r\ncloseness to the war which I had when I was with the doughboys. The\r\nattitude of the men here is so much more detached, impersonal. I fancy\r\nthis is because, however dangerous their work may be, they do not look\r\nforward to any actual physical conflict. It is the imaginative image of\r\n“Heinie” with a bayonet thrusting at his breast which makes the front so\r\nvivid in anticipation to the doughboy.\r\n\r\nBut now with the news from Château Thierry there is a certain tenseness\r\neverywhere. One feels that the hour is close at hand when every man that\r\nUncle Sam has in France may be needed. The barking of the guns at\r\npractice has taken on a new significance. Yesterday indeed it just\r\nmissed implying tragedy. Shortly after the jarring thunder of the “75s”\r\nhad started our dishes in the kitchen to rattling, came a frantic\r\nmessage by telephone. A party of engineers were surveying for the\r\nnarrow-gauge railway just beyond the hill over which the battery was\r\nshooting. One shell had narrowly missed them.\r\n\r\nToday an aviator in a little Spad machine came down at our back door. He\r\nhad lost his way, exhausted his gas, and was forced to descend. He had\r\nthought he was over Germany so his relief on finding himself among\r\nfriendly faces may be imagined. But aviation doesn’t mean what it used\r\nto any more to us. We have lost our aviator. Shortly after I came to\r\nGondrecourt we began to have an aerial visitor. Every few days about\r\nsundown he would appear; flashing up over the eastern hill horizon, to\r\ncircle the big open drill ground, dipping, soaring, playing all manner\r\nof madcap tricks just for the sheer joy of it, now he would sweep so low\r\nas almost to touch the ridgepole of the hut, then up, up again with a\r\nrush, waving his hand to us below as we waved and shouted with all our\r\nmight up at him. The whole camp would turn out to see; it was one of the\r\nevents of the day. “It’s Lufberry,” some one told me. Not long ago we\r\nread in the paper that Major Lufberry had been killed. We waited in\r\nsuspense. Had it really been he? Would our aviator never come again?\r\nNight after night we watched for him; he never came.\r\n\r\nThe fields about, which have been golden with buttercups and primroses,\r\nwhite with daisies, and purple with flowers whose names I do not know,\r\nare now crimsoning with poppies. “Artillery flowers,” the boys call\r\nthem. They pick them and stick them jauntily in their overseas caps, or\r\nin great bunches, bring them to me to brighten the canteen.\r\n\r\nSince the boys are going soon I have been trying desperately to make\r\nthem extra special goodies; candy, stuffed dates, frosted cookies,\r\nand—what pleases them as much as anything—hard-boiled eggs. It has been\r\na revelation to me here in France, the American appetite for eggs. The\r\nboys will walk miles to get them; they will cheerfully pay as high as\r\ntwo dollars a dozen for them. I buy twelve dozen at a time, carry them\r\nout to the canteen and boil them in the dishpan. Placed on sale they\r\ndisappear in the winking of an eye, and then the cry is always, “Ain’t\r\nyou got no more?” Sometimes I take Neddy with me on my shopping\r\nexpeditions; Neddy carries my market basket, smokes his pipe and looks\r\nas pleased as Punch. Today in our quest we stopped in at a store kept by\r\ntwo extremely pretty _Mademoiselles_. As we entered we were greeted by\r\npeals of girlish laughter. In a chair in the corner sat a tired M. P.\r\nfast asleep, his mouth wide-open; between his lips one of the pretty\r\ngirls had just at that moment popped a round ripe strawberry.\r\n\r\n\r\nGondrecourt, June 18.\r\n\r\nBesides the American Camp Hospital there is a French Hospital at\r\nGondrecourt, a place with a hint of old-world flavour to it, the nursing\r\nbeing done by Sisters of Charity. Here through some freak of chance a\r\nweek ago arrived sixteen Tommies from the English front, after having\r\ntravelled half over the map of France. They were none too pleased to\r\nfind themselves in a French Hospital and several, being walking cases,\r\nstraightway deserted and sneaked over to the American Hospital only to\r\nbe regretfully returned again. They have a little Algerian in a red fez\r\nwith them whom they have nicknamed “Charlie Chaplin.” Although\r\nintercourse between them is restricted entirely to sign language, the\r\nTommies have adopted Charlie as their mascot and Charlie follows them\r\nabout just like a dog.\r\n\r\nMy friend the English Lady, having little to do in her canteen since the\r\nSchool closed, has appointed herself as a sort of foster-mother to the\r\nwhole cockney brood. She acts as interpreter and sometimes as\r\nintercessor, for the Tommies are impatient of the hospital discipline\r\nand cause the authorities frequent anxiety, helps the Sisters out in\r\nnursing them and, best of all, makes them tea at four o’clock or\r\nthereabouts, accompanying it with bread and butter sandwiches. Frankly,\r\nthe Tommies think that they are little short of starved on the French\r\nHospital rations, and the tea helps. When they can they sneak over to\r\nthe American Hospital and beg a meal there, but such excursions are\r\nfrowned upon by those in authority.\r\n\r\nYesterday the English Lady gave a tea party for the Tommies in her\r\ncanteen. She arranged to have a truck go fetch them. To her\r\nastonishment, instead of one, two trucks appeared and instead of just\r\nthe Englishmen, the whole hospital that was able to stand on two legs or\r\none arrived with them; big black Algerians and Moroccans in every shade\r\nof duskiness and poilus by the half score. The hut was crowded, there\r\nweren’t enough chairs to go around. The English Lady sent out a hurry\r\ncall to bring up the reserves in refreshments. Neddy and I came over\r\nfrom our hut with our arms full of cups; more water was put on to boil\r\nfor the tea, new packages of biscuits opened. Then while the water\r\nheated the English Lady took all the liveliest ones out for a walk\r\nthrough the Château grounds, while “Skipper”, her detail, who is a\r\nclever pianist, entertained the rest with music. During the playing one\r\nenormous Algerian, as black as night, stared fascinated at the piano,\r\nthen edged slowly nearer and nearer to finally lay one incredulous\r\nfinger, with infinite caution on one of the end keys. He had evidently\r\nnever seen such a thing before, and more than half suspected it was all\r\nmagic.\r\n\r\nThen the water boiled and we made the tea and carried cups and bowls of\r\nit around with canned milk and commissary sugar. The Frenchmen, true to\r\ntype, with the scarcity of sugar in mind would only take one lump, until\r\nyou invited them to have another, when each, with evident pleasure, took\r\na second. As we could only muster six teaspoons between our two canteens\r\nto supply the whole company, we had to pass the spoons from guest to\r\nguest allowing each man just long enough for a good stir and then on to\r\nthe next. The men with wounded arms got their neighbors to stir for\r\nthem. With the tea we served sandwiches; these were a special treat to\r\nthe poilus because they were made with American army bread. Now to my\r\nmind our white army bread is very poor and tasteless stuff in comparison\r\nwith the grey well-flavored French war-bread, but the French, probably\r\non account of the novelty, prize highly any scraps of the _pain\r\nAméricaine_ that they can obtain. “Why, they eat it just like cake!” one\r\nboy said to me. Besides the sandwiches, there were little cookies and\r\ncandies and cigarettes and finally, the gift of an American officer who\r\nhappened in, an orange for each man to take home with him.\r\n\r\nWhen the tea was finished it was time for the guests to go. Crowded into\r\nthe trucks they rolled out through the Château gates, the poilus smiling\r\nand waving their good hands, while the Tommies raised a ragged cheer.\r\n\r\nAs Neddy and I returned to our canteen we paused at the door of one of\r\nthe barracks to listen to the band producing pandemonium within. This\r\nband is the pet project of Battery D, the dearest hope of Corporal R.\r\nwho is theatrical producer, impresario, librettist, base soloist, and\r\nband leader for the battery. The instruments were finally assembled some\r\nten days ago. The one thing required of a member seemed to be that he\r\nhad never played that particular sort of an instrument before. For the\r\nlast ten days the band has been practicing, mostly in the Y. They have\r\nalways played the same tune, yet I have never been able to decide what\r\nthat tune was. Now that the battery is going to the front, the\r\ninstruments must be put in store and our budding band disbanded almost\r\nbefore it had begun. The instruments are to be interned at Abainville,\r\nthe town next door. When the day comes to relinquish them the band is\r\ngoing to march all the way from Gondrecourt to Abainville in state,\r\nplaying their one tune over and over.\r\n\r\nTonight Corporal R. sat on a barrel in the kitchen polishing his French\r\nhorn with the Secretary’s pink tooth-paste. It made excellent\r\nbrass-polish he had discovered.\r\n\r\n“It’s too bad you can’t take that band of yours up front,” remarked\r\nSnow.\r\n\r\n“What for?”\r\n\r\n“’Cause it sure would make the boys feel like fighting.”\r\n\r\n\r\nGondrecourt June 22.\r\n\r\nThe boys have gone! We saw the last battery off on the train tonight.\r\nThe guns were loaded on flat cars, horses and men lodged together in the\r\nbox cars, the boys sleeping under the horses’ very noses and in danger\r\nof being nipped, it seemed to me, by an ill-tempered beast. The boys who\r\nwere to sleep with the guns on the flat cars would be much better off I\r\nthought; they had made themselves cozy little nests of straw underneath\r\nthe gun-carriages. Some of the boys in the box cars, I was pained to\r\nobserve, had smuggled in bottles with them.\r\n\r\nThe English Lady and I had arrived at the station none too soon. We had\r\nno more than walked the length of the train, inspecting each car and\r\nwishing every boy Good-bye and Good-luck when the engine whistled and\r\nwas off. We stood on the platform and waved to the boys who leaned from\r\ntheir cars and waved back until a curve in the track cut off our sight.\r\n\r\nThese last few days have been hectic. Wednesday was my birthday. Neddy\r\nfound it out and told the boys. They had observed that I didn’t have any\r\nraincoat; indeed rainy nights I was always embarrassed by the offer of\r\nhalf a dozen different rubber coats and ponchos to go home in; so they\r\ndecided,—bless them!—to supply this lack. A crowd of non-coms went\r\ndowntown; they took along one boy with them as a cloak model because he\r\nwas about my height and “looked like a girl”; and they made him try on\r\nevery raincoat in Gondrecourt. Finally they selected one, brought it\r\nback and made a ceremonious presentation. The raincoat is a beauty, and\r\never since I have worn it every day, rain or shine, just to show them\r\nhow much I thought of it.\r\n\r\nIt was hard to part with little Neddy. The Secretary presented him with\r\na farewell pipe. I clasped around his neck a chain bearing a little\r\nsilver cross; it was to keep him safe, body and soul from harm. He was\r\nalmost moved to tears. The Secretary and I, he told me, had been “like a\r\nlittle papa and a daddy to him,” and then, flushing, joined in my\r\nlaughter.\r\n\r\nAt the last moment one of the D Battery cooks came stealthily to the\r\nback door.\r\n\r\n“Me an the other fellers in the kitchen,” he confided _sotto voce_, “we\r\nwanted to do something to show you folks how much we thought of you. So\r\nwe just made up our minds to send yer this.”\r\n\r\n_This_ was a ten pound can of issue bacon.\r\n\r\nThe Secretary leaves tomorrow for Paris. He is going in order to buy\r\nhimself some new clothes. It seems that all his belongings entrusted to\r\nthe local laundresses disappeared one by one until he found himself\r\nreduced to a single set. Last night he washed these out himself and put\r\nthem in the oven to dry. When he remembered them this morning it was to\r\nfind nothing left but a little cinder heap.\r\n\r\nThe camp, for the present at least, is to be abandoned; the hut, for the\r\narmy wishes to use the barracks elsewhere, torn down. In a few days the\r\nlittle Artillery School Canteen will be nothing but a memory.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER V: ABAINVILLE—THE ENGINEERS\r\n\r\n\r\nAbainville July 1.\r\n\r\n“Abainville is going to be bombed off the face of the map.” Every time\r\nanyone has mentioned Abainville in my hearing during the last six weeks\r\nthey have wound up with some such prophecy as this. Abainville is an\r\nengineering camp, Abainville is the starting-point for the narrow-gauge\r\nsystem that is to supply a certain sector of the American front. Already\r\nthe great car shops have been built and stand gaunt and staring with\r\nmore glass in their glittering sides than I have seen on this side of\r\nthe Atlantic. It is these shops in particular that are held to be such\r\nshining marks for enemy aircraft. Anyway we have this comfort that if\r\nthe Boche gets us we will all go together, for the town is so tiny that\r\nif a bomb hit it anywhere, it would wreck the major part of the village\r\nand there isn’t a single cellar in the whole vicinity!\r\n\r\nJust at present Abainville is in a state of suspense. There is some\r\nquestion among those in high places as to whether after all the site,\r\nfor such extensive operations as have been planned, is well selected.\r\nWork on the narrow-gauge goes on, but the work on the shops has been\r\nsuspended. Everyone is anxiously awaiting the decision.\r\n\r\nThe hut, which is on the far edge of the camp, is a huge empty shell,\r\nfor work on this too has been stopped pending developments. Up till the\r\nday I arrived the Y. was doing business in a tent near the highway, but\r\nbeing notified that the engineers were going to run a railway through\r\nthat spot the next day, they had moved out and over to the unfinished\r\nhut in a hurry.\r\n\r\nMy billet has a fine central location,—at the corner of La Grande Rue\r\nand the national highway that runs through the town. My window overlooks\r\nwhat approximates the town square, an open dusty space, bounded on the\r\nsouth by the principal café, on the east by the butcher’s shop, on the\r\nwest by manure-heaps and on the north by my billet. In this square, it\r\nappears, all the village pig-killings take place. It is incredible and\r\npainful how many pigs of a marketable maturity a town no larger than\r\nAbainville can produce. Arguing from the frequency of the pig-killings I\r\nam convinced that if a census were taken Abainville would be found to\r\ncontain more pigs than people.\r\n\r\nFurther down la Grande Rue one comes to the church and the town-hall.\r\nUpstairs in the Mairie my co-worker, Miss S., has her billet. Downstairs\r\nis the village school and the living apartments of the schoolmaster’s\r\nfamily, refugees from the invaded territory. I peeped in at the empty\r\nschoolroom yesterday: on the wall was a large pictorial chart designed\r\nto impress upon the infant mind the advantages of drinking beer, cider\r\nand wine, rather than the more potent alcohols; a lesson vividly\r\ndemonstrated by a series of cuts portraying a pair of guinea pigs. The\r\nguinea pig who indulged in cognac and kindred beverages was depicted in\r\nsuccessive stages of inebriation until at the end he is shown expiring\r\nin all the horrors of delirium, while the prudent guinea pig who took\r\nnothing stronger than _vin_, _biére et cidre_ is pictured first in a\r\nstate of mild and genial intoxication, and then the “morning after” with\r\nall the zest of a good digestion and a clear conscience, breakfasting on\r\na sober cabbage leaf.\r\n\r\nThe church next door to the Mairie is remarkable for nothing except the\r\npeculiar sound like a wheezing snore which may be heard every evening\r\nissuing from the belfry. At first this sound was a mystery to us. I\r\ninquired of Madame; she was blank.\r\n\r\n“Perhaps,” I suggested remembering how in medieval lore evil spirits\r\nwere reputed to haunt church towers, “perhaps it is the devil in the\r\nbelfry.”\r\n\r\n“But no!” cried Madame scandalized. “The devil doesn’t live in\r\nAbainville!”\r\n\r\n“To be sure,” I amended hastily, “the devil is a Boche! He lives at\r\nBerlin.”\r\n\r\n“_Mais, oui, oui, oui!_”\r\n\r\nBut now the riddle has been read. The devil in the belfry is in reality\r\nan ancient owl, _une chouette_, who has inhabited the church tower time\r\nout of mind.\r\n\r\nThere is a Salvation Army hut here, the first one I have seen. It is\r\ndown by the main road; the canteen occupies one end of a barracks, which\r\nis used as a store-house, then there is an ell containing the kitchen.\r\nThe staff comprises one man and two women; they are pleasant people,\r\n“real home folks.” Two or three times a week, for supplies are hard to\r\nobtain, they make pie or cake or doughnuts. On these nights, passing the\r\nhut on our way back from mess, one sees a long line stretching down the\r\nroad, waiting patiently for the chance to get a piece of pie “like\r\nMother used to make.” Our relationships are cordial. We help each other\r\nout in the matter of change. They come to our hut for sweet chocolate\r\nand movies; we go to them, when our consciences will permit, for\r\ndoughnuts. I only wish that one of their huts could be in every camp in\r\nFrance.\r\n\r\n\r\nAbainville, July 8.\r\n\r\nBy courtesy of a group of officers we are messing at a house with a\r\nparticularly noisome front-door gutter and the Most Beautiful Girl in\r\nFrance to wait on us. La Belle Marguerite, as I always think of her, is\r\ntall and stately with a lovely gracious bearing and a sensitive,\r\nresponsive face; what’s more, she only paints a little. She affects to\r\nspeak no English but I suspect she understands a good deal. At meal\r\ntimes when we are present the officers never look twice at her, but any\r\nevening that one happens past the house one can see two cigarette ends\r\ngleaming from the darkness just inside the mess-room window: the\r\nofficers are making up for lost time. Yesterday La Belle looked so pale\r\nand _distraite_ at dinnertime that I was quite distressed, fancying\r\nheart-break. “Mademoiselle Marguerite is sad,” I told Madame my hostess.\r\nMadame immediately went forth on a Visit of investigation. “Mademoiselle\r\nhas the tooth-ache!” she announced on her return. Today at dinner,\r\nhaving finished our salade, we waited in vain for dessert. La Belle\r\nMarguerite, usually so prompt and so efficient, simply did not appear.\r\nAfter waiting until I grew tired I gave it up and left. Passing by the\r\nkitchen door I glanced inside. In front of the hearth stood Marguerite\r\nand a handsome Russian officer, and oh! the coquetry of her eyes, the\r\nseduction of her smiling, scarlet lips! It was evident that the mess in\r\nthe next room was wiped as clean from her mind as if it never had been!\r\nWhether my messmates ever got their dessert or not I haven’t heard.\r\n\r\nBesides La Belle Marguerite, the one unique feature of our mess is a\r\ncertain set of plates. These are French picture plates with jokes on\r\nthem. The jokes are all of a gustatory nature and pertain to things\r\nwhich most people would prefer not to think about while they are eating.\r\nOne rather striking design represents the proprietor of a Swiss resort\r\nhotel delicately sniffing a platter of fish as he says to the waitress:\r\n\r\n“These trout are passe. Keep them for the customers who have colds in\r\ntheir heads.”\r\n\r\nOn another an irate diner is exclaiming over an item on his bill:\r\n\r\n“Three francs for a chicken! What’s that?”\r\n\r\n“Why that was the little chicken that Monsieur found in his egg!”\r\n\r\nThere is always an anxious moment of suspense whenever a guest comes to\r\ndinner, a moment in which one peeps furtively out of the corners of\r\none’s eyes to see whether the newcomer has noticed the picture on his\r\nplate, and if so, whether he has got the point. Sometimes the guest will\r\nask to have the text translated for him and then there is an awkward\r\npause.\r\n\r\nThe question of what to serve at the canteen is a vexed one these days\r\nas it is quite too hot for chocolate. By scouring the country we managed\r\nto procure several cases of lemons, and then found our work for the day\r\nlaid out,—just squeezing them. A few days ago, however, a shipment of\r\nbottled fruit juices arrived at the warehouse; by mixing this syrup with\r\nwater and a small amount of lemon a delicious drink can be obtained. The\r\nboys have dubbed it a dozen different names, “_Camouflage vin rouge_”\r\nbeing one of them, but “_pink lemonade_” is the title it commonly passes\r\nunder. Already it has become famous and every drunk in camp if\r\nquestioned as to how he came to be in that condition will unblushingly\r\nassert that it was through drinking “that Y. M. C. A. pink lemonade.”\r\n\r\nIf we could only get ice! Yesterday I investigated the possibilities, to\r\nfind that if one were very ill and in desperate need of it, could\r\nproduce a certificate to that effect signed by half a dozen doctors,\r\napproved by the Sanitary Inspector, passed upon by the local Board of\r\nHealth and sealed by the Mayor with the sanction of the Town Council,\r\none could, by means of this document, procure at the brewery at\r\nGondrecourt a piece of ice about as large as a small-sized egg. Somehow\r\nit doesn’t seem quite worth the trouble.\r\n\r\nLacking ice, we do our best with freshly-drawn water which comes\r\npleasantly cool from the deep wells drilled by American engineers to\r\nsupply the camp,—when it does come. But often just when the thirsty ones\r\nare crowding thickest you make a frantic dash to the faucet only to find\r\nthat the supply has been cut off: there is not enough water in the\r\nwells, it seems, to supply all the engines and pink lemonade besides for\r\nthe whole camp. Then there is nothing to do but to take a pail and set\r\nout. After climbing over a couple of freight trains and ploughing\r\nthrough a dozen cinder heaps one comes at last to the pump-house, where\r\none may, by assuming an ingratiating manner, beg a pailful,—strictly\r\nagainst the regulations,—from the man at the pump. And then, after all,\r\nwhat use is a mere pailful of lemonade in a thirsty camp?\r\n\r\n\r\nAbainville, July 10.\r\n\r\nWe have stopped fighting the war and have gone into the movie business.\r\nFor two days all work has been suspended while the camp has posed before\r\nthe camera. They are making a big propaganda film for use in the States,\r\nentitled “America’s Answer to the Hun” and Abainville and the\r\nAbainville-Sorcy narrow-gauge is to be part of that answer. “Camouflage\r\npictures” sneer the boys, and camouflage pictures I blush to say they\r\nfrankly are. For on the screen the peaceful valley through which the\r\nnarrow-gauge is being built is to masquerade as a field of battle.\r\nCamouflaged engineers, armed and equipped as infantry will march\r\nvaliantly across the landscape, while other engineers in helmets, with\r\ntheir gas-masks at the alert, are plying their picks and shovels amid\r\nthe smoke of camouflage shrapnel; the climax being attained when the\r\nhelmeted engineers effect a lightning repair feat by bridging over a\r\ncarefully dug camouflage shell-hole.\r\n\r\nYesterday I saw a photograph cut from the Sunday Supplement of one of\r\nAmerica’s best known and most respected newspapers. Underneath the\r\npicture ran the text, “American boys playing baseball on a field in\r\nFrance where shells fall daily.” To my certain knowledge the only shells\r\nthat have ever fallen on that field or within many miles of it are\r\npeanut shells. For the field in the picture is most plainly and\r\nindisputably the Y. athletic field at Gondrecourt. Will I ever, I\r\nwonder, recover my pre-war faith in newspapers and photographs and\r\nmovies and such things?\r\n\r\nBut now we have done our turn before the camera, it’s back to work again\r\nand very hard work at that, for the officers are determined to set a\r\nrecord for all the world in laying track. Already the little railway has\r\nshot ahead at an amazing rate; though whether track laid in such a hurry\r\nis really going to make for speed in the long run is a question on which\r\nthe trainmen, sipping their pink lemonade at the canteen counter, have\r\ntheir own opinions. For no train, it seems, can make the run at present\r\nwithout leaving the track at least once during the journey.\r\n“Sun-trouble” say the officers, which means, being interpreted, that the\r\nheat of the sun’s rays has warped the rails. “Sun trouble nothin,’”\r\ngrunt the men. “It’s just not takin’ the time to do the job decent.”\r\nWhen the “sun trouble” doesn’t serve to throw a train off the track, the\r\nFrench children see to it that the same effect is produced by the simple\r\nexpedient of dropping spikes in between the ends of adjoining rails.\r\n\r\nYesterday I was talking with an engineer from Tours. He and his fireman\r\nhad just brought a Belgian engine up from that city for use in the\r\nAbainville yards. The attitude of the train crew who received it was\r\nplainly “thank-you-for-nothing-sirs!”, Belgian engines being none too\r\npopular with A. E. F. railroad men. The two crews sat in the hut for a\r\nlong while holding a symposium over the Belgian engine’s oddities; at\r\nlast the home crew departed, looking very glum. In the course of my\r\nsubsequent conversation with the visiting engineer I happened to ask:\r\n\r\n“Would you vote for Pershing for president?”\r\n\r\n“No sir!” he answered emphatically. “All the railroad men over here have\r\ngot it in for him.” He went on to explain.\r\n\r\nFrench railroad engineers are allowed a certain amount of coal and oil\r\nwith which to make their runs; for anything that they can save out of\r\nthis, they are reimbursed. This idea appealed to the American train\r\ncrews who were attached to the French. They set to work and saved,—far\r\nmore than the French were able to! The French proceeded to depreciate\r\nthe quality of coal allowed them, instead of giving them half dust and\r\nhalf briquets, they gave them three-quarters dust and finally all dust\r\nyet still the Americans were able to beat the French at saving. And each\r\nman in fancy was rolling up a tidy little sum for himself.\r\n\r\n“And then,” continued my informant, “Pershing came out and said that we\r\nweren’t here to make money off the French, but to help them, so we\r\nweren’t to get the money for all the coal and oil we had saved after\r\nall. And that’s why there isn’t a railroad man in France who has any use\r\nfor him.”\r\n\r\nHow much of politics could be reduced, I wonder, to a mere question of\r\npocketbook?\r\n\r\nHe went on to tell me among other things that although a French\r\nconductor would be furious if you stopped a train in the middle of a run\r\nfor any other reason, if you just said; “Come on, ol’ top, and have a\r\nbottle of _vin rouge_ on me,” he was all beaming acquiescence. “Just\r\nimagine,” he concluded disgustedly, “stopping a main-line train in\r\nAmerica so the crew could go into a saloon and get a drink!”\r\n\r\n\r\nAbainville, July 14.\r\n\r\nThe Bastille has fallen! We celebrated its fall today with much\r\nenthusiasm. Ostensibly in order to signalize the Franco-American\r\nAlliance, the festivities in reality were planned as propaganda of a\r\ndifferent sort. Surreptitiously but quite definitely the end and aim of\r\nthem was to flatter the Major.\r\n\r\nNow the Major in command of the camp at Abainville is what—if he weren’t\r\na major—one would be tempted to term a “hard-boiled guy.” Being of the\r\nbid school he looks with a jaundiced eye at all welfare organizations,\r\nparticularly, I gather, at the feminine element in them. He calls the\r\ncollege men in the regiment “sissy boys” and believes in treating them\r\nto an extra dose of pick and shovel. What’s more, it is an open secret\r\nthat he would like to swap the whole outfit of them for a regiment of\r\nMexican desperadoes, with whom he has had considerable experience. As\r\nthe boys say, he speaks three languages, English, Mexican and Profane,\r\nand of the three he is the most proficient in the last.\r\n\r\nSo in view of all this, the Fourteenth of July celebration was gotten up\r\nchiefly in order to give the Major a chance to appear in all his glory\r\nand make a speech, this being, it is claimed, one of the surest ways to\r\ntickle the vanity and so win the heart of a man.\r\n\r\nWe decorated the half-finished hut with flags and bunting, screening the\r\nyawning cavern back of the stage with broad strips of red, white and\r\nblue cheesecloth. Then we officially invited the whole town to attend.\r\nThe whole town, from grandmother to baby, came dressed in their Sunday\r\nbest. The programme started with an informal concert by an impromptu\r\njazz orchestra varied by some Harry Lauder impersonations delivered by\r\nan unexpected youth who somehow strayed on to the stage. For a few\r\nmoments we were painfully uncertain as to whether the effect produced\r\nwas due just to Harry Lauder or to _vin rouge_, finally deciding that a\r\nshare at least of the credit should be allowed the latter. Fortunately\r\nHarry’s appearance on the stage was short; he left us fondly hoping that\r\nthe French hadn’t realized anything was amiss.\r\n\r\nThe Major of course opened the formal programme. He read his speech. It\r\nwasn’t a bad speech, representing, as it did, the combined efforts of\r\none captain, two lieutenants and the clerk in the Headquarters office,\r\nand was sufficiently fiery in its reference to the Germans to be quite\r\nin keeping with the Major’s character. The Major sat down amid\r\nthunderous applause. The Secretary had vainly tried to arrange to have a\r\nlittle girl present him with a bouquet at the end of his speech: perhaps\r\nit was just as well the way it was,—a bouquet might have proved\r\nembarrassing to the Major. When the applause had died down the Major’s\r\ninterpreter stepped out and gave a brief summary of the address in\r\nFrench for the benefit of the villagers. Then we had the Mayor of\r\nAbainville and after him the Cure, looking very handsome in his\r\nbeautiful French officer’s uniform. They both delivered flowery\r\nspeeches, enlarging upon the mutual affections of the two nations, which\r\nwere translated briefly into English by the interpreter for the benefit\r\nof the Americans.\r\n\r\nAfter the speeches the school children, who had been fidgeting about\r\nlike so many little crickets in their front-row seats, swarmed up on the\r\nstage and, standing in a long line with flag-bearers at each end, sang\r\nthe Marseillaise in their funny shrill little voices. Then we all sang\r\nthe Star Spangled Banner, and after that there was a movie. As luck\r\nwould have it, instead of an adventure of the western plains, fate had\r\nsent us a romance of high finance. We had asked the interpreter to\r\nannounce the titles of the pictures in French for the benefit of the\r\nvillagers but when he discovered that this meant making clear the\r\nintricacies of the New York Stock Exchange to the mind of the French\r\npeasant, he baulked and bolted. It must have been just about as\r\nintelligible to them as Coptic, yet they sat tight and at least looked\r\ninterested.\r\n\r\nEverybody considers the affair a success. The Secretary was in high\r\nspirits over the evening.\r\n\r\n“The Major was pleased, I’m sure,” he declared. “As for the French, it\r\nwas an occasion which they will always remember. Why it was just like\r\ntransplanting the whole village there. The grandmother and the babies,\r\nthe mayor, the priest, the school-teacher and his scholars; every\r\nvillage institution was represented!”\r\n\r\n“Everything,” I said—I was tired, “but the pig-killings.”\r\n\r\n\r\nAbainville, July 20.\r\n\r\nI have just established what I think must be the smallest “hut” in\r\nFrance, and such fun as it was doing it!\r\n\r\nThere is a detachment of about a hundred engineers stationed, while they\r\nbuild the narrow-gauge railway, at a little village about ten miles to\r\nthe north, called Sauvoy. The other day I went with the Athletic\r\nDirector in a side-car to take them some baseball equipment. The boys I\r\nfound were billeted in dark dingy lofts and had to eat their meals, rain\r\nor shine, sitting just anywhere in the streets of the village. The\r\nthought came to me; why shouldn’t they too have a Y? I approached the\r\nFrench Town Major, taking the barber-interpreter with me to lend me both\r\nmoral and lingual support. After some uncertainty he admitted that there\r\nwas a room which might be made to serve, a room over a stable to be\r\nsure, but a good room for all that; the rent would be thirteen sous a\r\nday,—I snapped it up.\r\n\r\nYesterday with all my materials assembled I started out for Sauvoy\r\nagain. We began work a little before noon, myself and four engineers.\r\nBefore the afternoon was over we had changed a filthy loft, its grimy\r\nwalls covered with obscene scrawls, into as cunning a little\r\npocket-edition Y. as one could find I think in France. Sweeping the dust\r\nand cobwebs from the rafters, we calcimined the ceiling and walls a\r\npretty creamy yellow; filled in the missing panes with vitex; hung\r\ncurtains of beautiful blue and green chintz at the windows; laid runners\r\nof the same across the tables lent with the benches by the _Major du\r\nCantonment_; decorated the walls, half-dry as they were, with stunning\r\nFrench posters; built shelves in the alcove corner where the built-in\r\nbed had been, filled them with books, games and writing materials; hung\r\ntwo big green Japanese lanterns from the beam in the center; and last of\r\nall put bowls of the loveliest flowers, larkspurs and snapdragons,\r\nbegged by the boys from the village gardens, on the shelves and tables,\r\ntogether with heaps of fresh magazines and the company victrola. In the\r\nmidst of all the scurry and hurry a red-faced frowsy Frenchwoman marched\r\nin upon us. She stalked across the room and tried the door which led\r\ninto the hay-loft: we had nailed it fast. We must open that door\r\nimmediately, she declared, otherwise she could not get the hay to feed\r\nthe horse downstairs. I saw my pretty room used as a passage-way by a\r\nbeery old termagant and my heart sank. After some discussion, however,\r\nour visitor proposed an alternative. If we would supply her with a\r\nladder, she could climb up into the loft from below. But how, I asked\r\nhelplessly, was I to get a ladder? One of the boys winked at me and\r\ndisappeared; ten minutes later he was back dragging a ladder after him.\r\nOur French friend was satisfied.\r\n\r\n“But how did you get it?” I asked wonderingly.\r\n\r\nHe looked at me reprovingly. “In this Man’s Army,” he remarked, “you\r\nshould learn not to ask such questions.”\r\n\r\nWhen the last touch had been bestowed there was still an hour before the\r\ntruck which was to take me home was slated for departure. Someone\r\nsuggested a visit to the Château. So the Top Sergeant, the\r\nbarber-interpreter, the Town Major and I all set out together.\r\n\r\nThe Château at Sauvoy is a fifteenth century Château, cut out of an old\r\npicture-book, surrounded by a high wall and just about big enough for\r\ntwo. One enters, oddly enough, through the kitchen which is enormous and\r\nlike a Dutch _genre_ painter’s “Interior,” with a cobble-stone floor, an\r\neight-foot fireplace, dried herbs and vegetables hanging from the\r\nrafters and everywhere on the long shelves, the soft gleam of pewter and\r\nthe mellow tones of old china-ware. From the kitchen one steps into a\r\ntiny dining-room paneled in dark carved wood with a bird-cage, empty\r\nnow, built into the wall. Beyond this is the _salon_ with a wonderful\r\nold tapestry stretched across one of its walls and some exquisite Louis\r\nQuinze chairs in which kings and queens might have sat.\r\n\r\nBut the best thing about the Château is the Chatelain, an old French\r\ngentleman, eighty-nine years of age, the last of his family, who lives\r\nall alone, except for one antique serving-woman, in this beautiful dim\r\nold mansion, wears _sabots_, keeps bees for a living, and every day of\r\nhis life cuts from the _journal_ the little daily English lesson, pastes\r\nit in a tiny note-book, and then his poor old eyes an inch from the\r\npaper, cons the words over and over, reading them aloud with _such_ a\r\npronunciation!\r\n\r\n“In three months,” he told us proudly, “I am going to be an American.”\r\n\r\nHe related to us how in 1870 the town was invaded by the Germans and he\r\ntaken prisoner. But the Germans were gentlemen then and treated him\r\nhumanely; he couldn’t understand what had changed them to such savage\r\nbeasts. He took us out and showed us his precious bees. We went through\r\nthe garden, a charming place with little box hedges and rose bushes and\r\ncurrant bushes and gooseberries all growing together in the true French\r\nstyle. Beyond we came to an open oblong of greensward edged by trees\r\nwith fifty hives ranged around it, the hives,—of all quaint\r\nconceits—being made like little Chinese houses, each one different from\r\nthe rest, each painted red and blue, a bit shabby and worn by time, but\r\nstill gay and jaunty nevertheless. Monsieur guaranteed us that the bees\r\nwouldn’t sting, they weren’t bad bees he said, so we consented to be led\r\nabout to each hive in turn and peered in through the little glass\r\nwindows at the bees making honey. Sad to say, this is a bad year for\r\nsweets and instead of hundreds of pounds of honey, there will be\r\nscarcely one to sell.\r\n\r\nWe went back through the garden and here Monsieur must gather a bouquet\r\nfor me. Around and about the garden he hurried, going to every bush in\r\nturn, putting his poor dim eyes down into the very leaves of each,\r\nsearching for just what he wanted; and finally it was done, pink and\r\nwhite roses, red geraniums, camomile and white pinks, made up in a\r\nlittle stiff bunch and tied with a bit of scarlet string. Then he must\r\npresent it with a deep bow and a gallant speech “from an old Frenchman\r\nto _une jolie Américaine_”, while all the rest, including the ancient\r\nmaid-servant who had just returned from the fields with an apron full of\r\nclover for the rabbits, stood about and applauded and cried “Vive la\r\nFrance!” and then “Vive l’ Amérique!” in a quite truly stage manner.\r\n\r\nWe left the little Y. in charge of a boy from the Medical Corps. He has\r\nlittle to do except dispense pills to the French people, so he was\r\nwilling to look after it.\r\n\r\nThis morning word came in from Sauvoy that the Germans bombed it last\r\nnight. Luckily the bombs, evidently aimed at the railroad, fell just\r\noutside the village and did no harm; but poor old Monsieur must have\r\ngotten a bad fright.\r\n\r\n\r\nAbainville, August 1.\r\n\r\nAbainville’s future is at last assured. Work upon the hut has been\r\nresumed. The buzz of barracks-building fills all the place, the railroad\r\nyards gradually but relentlessly encroach; little by little they are\r\nruining the most beautiful poppy field in all the world.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile our family too has grown. A few days ago three new companies\r\nof engineers arrived in town. These are draft troops from Texas and\r\nOklahoma, in camp for only a few weeks in the States, shipped here\r\ndirectly from the base port, and so green to France that they don’t even\r\nknow what _oui oui_ means. On the trip here one of these boys, they\r\ntell, after gazing out the door of his “side-door pullman” in silence\r\nhalf the morning, remarked disgustedly;\r\n\r\n“This is a hell of a country!”\r\n\r\n“What’s the matter?”\r\n\r\n“Why all the stations have got the same name!”\r\n\r\n“The hell they have! What’s the name?”\r\n\r\n“_Sortie!_”\r\n\r\nThe Major in command of the new arrivals proves to be an old and none\r\ntoo amicable acquaintance of our Major’s, their mutual esteem having\r\nbeen obscured by a law-suit some time in the past which resulted in our\r\nMajor’s being forced to part with a considerable sum of money. To make\r\nhimself more welcome the new Major has introduced innovations. Up till\r\nnow, in accordance with our Major’s theories, we have been a strictly\r\nbusiness community, our energies concentrated chiefly upon what the boys\r\ncall P. and S.—pick and shovel. But now with the coming of the new\r\ndetachment we have blossomed out with all sorts of military frills.\r\nArmed sentinels marching their beats in a military manner fairly\r\nencumber the camp. One is halted and challenged a half-dozen times on\r\none’s way home from the canteen at ten o’clock in the evening. I am\r\nstartled out of my dreams in the middle of the night by shouts of,\r\n“Corporal of the Guard, Post Number Four!” under my very window. And the\r\nbest part of it is that these “Long Boys,” never having had so much as\r\nthe A-B-C of military training, make the drollest imitations of real\r\nsoldiers that ever were. The atmosphere at Headquarters has of late, I\r\ngather, been slightly tinged with electricity. But the boys belonging to\r\nthe older organizations in camp have been enjoying themselves to an\r\nunholy degree “stuffing” the new arrivals with ghastly tales of\r\nair-raids, gas bombs, and Serial machine-gun barrages.\r\n\r\nAs in all huts, we have a big map of France tacked to the wall where the\r\nboys can have easy access to it. After one of these maps has been up a\r\nshort while, it is always a simple matter when glancing at it, to locate\r\none’s self—one has only to look for a dirty spot; a little later,\r\ncountless more grimy fingers having in the meantime been applied, one\r\nlooks for the hole. Yesterday one of our new friends came to me and\r\nasked:\r\n\r\n“Please, Ma’am, could you tell me where that there place, ‘No Man’s\r\nLand’ that they talk about in the papers is? I’ve been a-lookin’ an’\r\na-lookin’ an’ I can’t find it on the map nowhere.”\r\n\r\nAlong with the new engineers Nanny arrived in town. Nanny is an Alabama\r\ngoat, smuggled on board the transport wrapped up in one of the boys’\r\novercoats. Her fleece is pure white and she is fat as a little\r\nbutter-ball. Already she is one of our most distinguished citizens.\r\nPossessed of an adventurous spirit, she makes herself free of every\r\nhouse in town, being particularly fond of climbing stairs and appearing\r\nat unsuspected moments in odd corners of one’s billet. Madame explains\r\nthe attraction here: “She smells an American, you see!” which is a\r\nquaint thought. Nanny is the pet detestation of the Adjutant, for she\r\nhas a _penchant_ for straying into his office and nibbling at every\r\npaper within reach. Already several valuable documents have disappeared\r\ndown her greedy little throat. Last night, in revenge, one of the boys\r\nin the Adjutant’s office, armed with a pot of bright red paint, painted\r\nNanny in “dazzle” designs. Today she is a sight.\r\n\r\nThis morning I was puzzled to observe that a considerable number of the\r\nnewcomers were wearing pink tickets in their hats.\r\n\r\n“What’s that?” I asked.\r\n\r\n“Them? Them’s meal tickets!” They explained; the report had gone around\r\nthat the chow of one of the companies was of superior quality;\r\nimmediately the chow line of that same company had assumed an inordinate\r\nlength. The mess sergeant, unable, since the company was so new, to\r\ndistinguish his own men from the self-invited guests, had found it\r\nnecessary to attach tags to the company.\r\n\r\nWith the coming of the new engineers, the sale of one article in stock\r\nhas swelled to unprecedented quantities. One member of the force is\r\nfairly kept busy from morning until night cutting off chunks of chewing\r\ntobacco. Texas and Oklahoma, it seems, have unlimited capacities for\r\nthis commodity. Now with all due respect to the honourable American\r\ntribe of chewers, this indulgence raises a very delicate question for\r\nthe canteen lady in whose charge rests the appearance of the hut. The\r\nscrap-boxes are already in a bad way, I frankly advocate spittoons, but\r\nour detail, who is a very superior lad, known among his cronies as “The\r\nInfant” because of his pink cheeks and innocently solemn air, flatly\r\nrefuses. There are some things, he declares, to which he will not stoop,\r\nand he grows very stiff and red in the face if I hint at it.\r\n\r\n“I have discussed the matter,” he told me yesterday, “with several very\r\neminent chewers, and they all agree that there isn’t the slightest\r\nnecessity for their behaviour!”\r\n\r\nThere may not be any necessity,—how am I to judge? But there is a very\r\nactual and urgent state of affairs. And what is one to do about it?\r\n\r\n\r\nAbainville, August 13.\r\n\r\nThe hut is finished. Now if at any time Marshal Foch or General Pershing\r\nor President Poincaré should happen this way, we could say: Come in,\r\ngentlemen, and behold us; don’t we look nice?\r\n\r\nThe main part of the hut, the big auditorium, is done in creamy yellow\r\nand brown with rafters of bright blue, the windows hung with curtains of\r\nsumptuous orange chintz. The writing-room is blue and yellow too, with\r\ngreen and yellow curtains on which, in a bower of branches, black-birds\r\nperch; runners of the same material lie across the writing tables, the\r\npractical advantage of this pattern being that whenever anyone spills a\r\nbottle of ink on a runner, it merely gives the effect of one more\r\nblack-bird. In each window of the writing-room is a little pot with a\r\nscarlet geranium, while the walls of both writing-room and auditorium\r\nare bright with beautiful French posters.\r\n\r\nBut the best of all the hut, to my mind at least, is the Tea\r\nRoom,—so-called until we think of something better to name it,—for the\r\nTea Room was my own particular pet scheme. According to the plans, the\r\nell behind the canteen counter was cut up into half a dozen little\r\nrooms. By eliminating part of the central hall, the “mess-room” and the\r\n“ladies’ room” and moving the office out to an unused corner by the\r\nmovie machine booth, we got space for a fair-sized room connected by a\r\nserving-window with the kitchen. Our matched lumber having run short we\r\nused rough lumber and covered it with burlap; each strip was a different\r\nweave and texture, to be sure, but all the same it was burlap! The\r\nwoodwork and little tables we painted a bright green, hung vivid green\r\ncurtains at the windows, then, taking the covers of chewing tobacco\r\nboxes, stained these green too, pasted in the centre of each a bright\r\nlittle water-color reproduction cut from an English art magazine, tacked\r\nthem up on the walls, and _voilà!_ as pretty a little room as could be\r\nfound short of Paris!\r\n\r\nIn the Tea Room we serve pink lemonade, hot chocolate, jam sandwiches,\r\ncookies and canned fruit. The boys are living on a diet of what they\r\ncall “goat’s meat” at present;—whenever it is time for a chow line to\r\nform you can hear a chorus of bleats and baas half across the camp,—and\r\nso sick of this have they become that many will sup off chocolate and\r\nsandwiches in the Tea Room by preference. Yesterday I took a chance and\r\ntried making a ten gallon boiler full of raspberry tapioca pudding,\r\nusing the bottled fruit juice. At first the boys were inclined to be\r\ncautious.\r\n\r\n“What do you call that?”\r\n\r\n“How would raspberry slum do?”\r\n\r\n“Well, I’ll try anything once!”\r\n\r\nBut after the first taste it went all too fast.\r\n\r\n“Say, are there any seconds on this?”\r\n\r\n“Lady,” said one lad solemnly to me, “with pudding like that I could\r\nstay four years more in the army.”\r\n\r\nOne of the divisions from the lines arrived in this area, a few days\r\nago, for a short period of rest. A number of the men are encamped up on\r\nthe hill near the old Artillery School and they come straying down to\r\nour hut. Poor lads, it is pitiful to see how wonderful it seems to them\r\nto be in a place that is clean and pretty.\r\n\r\n“This looks like a bit of heaven to me,” declared one boy.\r\n\r\nAnother, sitting in the Tea Room stirring his chocolate, commented,\r\n“Gee, this is a swell place in here. You ought ter get some fancy name\r\nfor it.”\r\n\r\n“What would you suggest?”\r\n\r\n“Well I should think,” he looked around, “you might call it Canary\r\nCottage.”\r\n\r\nYet occasionally I wonder if it really all pays, as when I pick out the\r\ncigar butts which, in spite of the trash boxes beneath the tables, the\r\nboys will persist in sticking in the vases of flowers and planting in\r\nthe geranium pots, or when, as last night, I catch a fellow using one of\r\nthe beautiful chintz runners from the tables with which to wipe the mud\r\noff his boots.\r\n\r\n\r\nAbainville, August 21.\r\n\r\n  Talk kills men.\r\n  Don’t talk. The walls have ears.\r\n  Keep mum, let the guns talk for you.\r\n\r\nThus are we placarded. Every hut, every café, every garage, every place\r\nof any sort where the A. E. F. may meet together and indulge in\r\nconversation, now bears a board with some such legend printed on it and\r\nafter each terse warning is the terser admonition; Read G. O. 39. A\r\ncampaign of silence is on foot. These catchy phrases, American\r\nvariations on the classic French line: _Taisez vous, méfiez vous, les\r\noreilles ennemies vous ecoutent!_—Be still, beware, the ears of the\r\nenemy are listening!—are to be perpetual reminders to us that we are all\r\ntoo prone to gossip indiscreetly.\r\n\r\nAs to just what one may say and mustn’t say, I for one confess, not\r\nhaving read G. O. 39, that I am in a quandary. I find myself hesitating\r\nbefore mentioning the fact that we had baked beans for dinner. As for\r\ntalking about the weather, why that leads naturally to the subject of\r\nmoonlight nights, and moonlight nights, as every one knows, now imply\r\nnot romance but air-raids and air-raids are of course a tabooed topic.\r\nIndeed I am beginning to have a sneaking conviction that perhaps it\r\nwould be better to discard speech entirely and take to conversing in\r\ndumb show.\r\n\r\nSometimes some small thing that comes to one’s attention will\r\ncrystallize a difference between two races so sharply as to be\r\nstartling. This was impressed on me the other day by two posters. Both\r\nthe French and American authorities have recently issued warnings to\r\ntheir soldiers concerning the practice of riding on the tops of railroad\r\ncars, since this habit has led to a number of casualties. The French\r\nposter reads something like this:\r\n\r\nWhereas it has been brought to the attention of the Commissioner of\r\nRailroads, that various accidents have occurred resulting from the\r\npractice indulged in by soldiers of obtruding a portion or the whole of\r\ntheir bodies beyond the limits of the car; it is urgently requested that\r\nthe soldiers in transit upon the railroad should henceforth restrict\r\nthemselves to the interior of the cars.\r\n\r\nThe American sign runs thus:\r\n\r\n“If you want to see the next block, keep yours inside! Your head may be\r\nhard but it’s not as hard as concrete!” Pithily it states the number of\r\ncasualties resulting from this trick, explains that the French bridges\r\nand tunnels only allow six inches clearance above the top of the cars,\r\nand ends;\r\n\r\n“Your life may not be worth anything to you, but it may cost your\r\ncountry $10,000.”\r\n\r\nBut the triumph of American sign art, a specimen of which hangs in the\r\nAdjutant’s office, is the gas-defense poster. It starts off with the Gas\r\nSchool slogan:\r\n\r\n“There are two classes of men in a gas attack, the quick and the dead,”\r\nproceeds to poetry:\r\n\r\n  “The hard-boiled guy said gas was bunk,\r\n  It couldn’t hurt you, only stunk....\r\n  The hard-boiled guy went up the line,\r\n  Fritz spilled the mustard good and fine;\r\n  And now some people wonder why\r\n  It’s flowers for the hard-boiled guy,”\r\n\r\nand ends with the admonition that seems a little ironical to one who\r\nmust struggle to make green wood burn in a broken-down French range;\r\n“Cook with it, don’t croak with it.”\r\n\r\nToday we put up a sign fill of our own over the counter. For some\r\nreason, transportation probably, there has been a most distressing lack\r\nof supplies in this area recently. Not only are we suffering, but the\r\nSalvation Army and even the sales commissaries have all been stricken\r\nwith the same famine. Indeed I was told of one commissary which bore the\r\nwarning; “We have salt, mustard and baking powder. That’s all.” Tired of\r\nreplying several hundred times a day; “I’m awfully sorry but we haven’t\r\nany so-and-so,” I made a sign which was a list of all the “haven’t gots”\r\nand tacked it up over the counter. Thinking to be funny I included\r\nstrawberry ice-cream among the rest, to be promptly punished by an\r\ninnocent-eyed youth who inquired hopefully; “What kind of ice-cream\r\n_have_ you got?”\r\n\r\nAnother boy read through the list once, twice, then looked up at the\r\nInfant disgustedly.\r\n\r\n“Why don’t you put ‘Hell!’ at the bottom of it?” he queried.\r\n\r\n“’Pears to me it would be easier to make a list of the things you _have_\r\ngot,” suggested another.\r\n\r\nA little while longer and if no help comes, we shall be doing this. I\r\ncan see that sign in my mind’s eye now. It will read something like\r\nthis:\r\n\r\n                                We have\r\n                            chewing tobacco\r\n                           indelible pencils\r\n                                  and\r\n                            shaving brushes\r\n\r\n\r\nAbainville, September 2.\r\n\r\nOnce a month, according to schedule, the whole personnel of the division\r\nis summoned to Y. Headquarters at Gondrecourt for a conference. Formerly\r\nthese conferences were largely religious in significance, consisting of\r\nmuch righteousness with a slight leaven of business. Each one in turn\r\nwas looked forward to as a pious but unprofitable duty and evaded when\r\npossible,—which wasn’t often. Now with a change in the directorship the\r\nconferences have taken on an almost entirely practical tone.\r\nIncidentally they have gained amazingly in popularity. For now one can\r\nattend a conference with confidence that during its progress one will\r\nsurely glean more than one quaint bit of human comedy.\r\n\r\nToday it was the Aviation Camp Secretary who supplied most of the spice.\r\nThis is an odd but very earnest little man whom I shall always remember\r\nas I saw him at the Gondrecourt railway station last May, starting for\r\nParis dressed up in a “tin hat” and a gas mask. Whether this was in\r\norder to bluff Paris into thinking that he had come straight from the\r\nfront, or whether this was to protect himself against the assaults of\r\nBig Bertha while in the city, I could not determine, but never since\r\nhave I been able to take the gentleman quite seriously.\r\n\r\nThe Aviation Secretary created the first sensation by rising suddenly to\r\nhis feet and reading a motion to the effect that the Gondrecourt\r\nDivision of the Y. M. C. A. should go on record as registering a protest\r\nagainst “the wicked state of the Paris streets,” citing Mr. Edward Bok\r\nand his action in the case of the streets of Liverpool. For a moment no\r\none said a word, then a secretary arose and requested that the motion be\r\namended to read more clearly, as in its present form it might be taken\r\nto refer to the condition of the paving, or the criminal recklessness of\r\nthe taxi drivers. The Warehouse Man then solemnly proposed that in view\r\nof Mr. Bok a ruling should be passed that while in Paris all secretaries\r\nshould be required to travel by the subway or in a cab. I wanted to ask\r\nif it wouldn’t do just as well if special prayers should be offered for\r\neach secretary on his departure for the wicked city, but refrained.\r\n\r\nNo sooner had the excitement over the Paris streets subsided, than the\r\nAviation Secretary was on his feet again with a second resolution. This\r\nwas in effect a petition to the Paris office that they send us\r\nproportionately less tobacco and more sweets for sale in the canteens.\r\nThis precipitated a fiery argument, the smokers lined up against the\r\nnon-smokers. Listening to the non-smokers you became convinced that the\r\nmanhood of America was on its way to ruin through excessive cigarettes;\r\nlistening to the smokers you became equally certain that the war would\r\nbe won by tobacco smoke. The situation became so tense one could almost\r\nsee the sparks in the air. In the end the smokers had it.\r\n\r\nThe next thrill was caused by one of the women workers who in the course\r\nof a speech took occasion to deprecate the housekeeping abilities of the\r\nmen secretaries. On Fourth of July, she declared, when the chocolate\r\ncups from all over the area had been sent into Gondrecourt for the\r\ncelebration there, some of them had been discovered to be in a shocking\r\nstate. These had later been traced to a hut where there was no woman\r\nworker. Instantly the Aviation Secretary was up again. This charge was a\r\npersonal matter, he declared, as the cups in question had been his.\r\nHowever he denied the implication. The cups had been perfectly clean\r\nwhen they left the hut, they must have become soiled en route. And so\r\nthe conference comedy is played out.\r\n\r\nAt the town of X. there is a secretary who declares he is devoting his\r\nlife to the service of the Lord. Some years ago he found himself\r\nbecoming deaf. So he told the Lord that if He would restore his hearing\r\nhe would spend the rest of his days in performing good works. He was\r\ncured. Last week he created a corner on eggs in this vicinity by buying\r\none hundred and twenty-five dozen at five francs per. Now he is\r\nreselling them for six. Wanting eggs badly to make custard for some sick\r\nboys here, and not being able to obtain them any other way, I walked\r\nover to X. and bought two dozen. When I got home I counted them, there\r\nwere just twenty-three. Surely the Lord got the worst of that bargain!\r\n\r\n\r\nAbainville, September 9.\r\n\r\nSomething is going to happen.\r\n\r\nWe have been used to seeing the French Army go by; interminable lines of\r\ncamions, so many feet apart, rolling through the town for hours on end.\r\nSometimes we have seen a section pass through on its way to the front,\r\nonly to return again some ten days later. Once seen, a French camion\r\ntrain is never forgotten, for each automobile section bears painted on\r\nits sides the distinctive insignia of the unit. These are sometimes\r\ndroll, sometimes sentimental, but always cleverly designed and usually\r\nstriking,—a poilu drinking _pinard_ from his canteen, a pelican, a polar\r\nbear, a dancing monkey, a soldier embracing a peasant girl, a grinning\r\nAlgerian’s head in ear rings and a red fez, a gendarme holding up a\r\nthreatening club.\r\n\r\nBut now by day, by night, it is the Americans who are passing through,\r\ntheir faces set toward the front, on troop-trains, in camions, on foot.\r\nComing home from the canteen in the evening one hears the heavy rattle\r\nthat means artillery on the move, and standing by the roadside peering\r\nthrough the darkness one can just discern horses and caissons,\r\nslat-wagons, supply-wagons and, looming ominously in the dim light, the\r\nformidable bulk of the great guns.\r\n\r\nNight before last I was awakened by the sound of troops passing, a\r\nregiment of infantry on the march. I lay and listened; the tramp, tramp,\r\ntramp of the rhythmic feet was unvarying, incessant, then came a break.\r\nThe order had been given to halt for a rest. The boys were evidently\r\nsitting down by the edge of the road. But though they rested they were\r\nby no means still.\r\n\r\n“_Oh Mademoiselle!_” they entreated the dark and unresponsive houses,\r\n“_Oh, Mademoiselle! Deux vin rouge toot sweet s’il vous plaît,\r\nMademoiselle!_”\r\n\r\nThey swore genially. They sang snatches of _Hail, hail the gang’s all\r\nhere_ and _Tipperary_. One boy had a mouth organ which he played with\r\nvim. Someone introduced a barnyard motif and they were off, crowing and\r\ncackling, mooing and bleating, imitating every animal known to domestic\r\nlife. They sounded like schoolboys off for a holiday and my God! they\r\nwere soldiers on the march to the front, their faces set to the battle!\r\n\r\nTonight as we came home from the hut, we were startled by a strange\r\nsight. The sky was clear, except for one dark mass shaped like a cloud\r\nof smoke which hung above the horizon to the north. As we looked,\r\nsuddenly the under side of the cloud turned an angry crimson, then in a\r\nmoment grew dark again. A minute later the red glow showed again only to\r\nfade but and be repeated. We knew that the angry light must be the glare\r\nreflected from the flashes of the guns which were belching red death\r\nacross the lines. All at once the battle-field seemed very near.\r\n\r\n\r\nAbainville, September 14.\r\n\r\nWe have taken the Saint Mihiel salient! The news came in yesterday over\r\nthe wires. At first we couldn’t believe it. We have heard so many\r\nwonderful but alas! too hopeful things over those wires! But now the\r\nnewspapers have proved it, with their maps showing the salient cut off\r\nas clean as by a knife. And if we wanted concrete proof, why we have\r\nthat too. They have sent for a detail of engineers from Abainville to\r\nbuild hurry-up prison pens. They simply haven’t any place to put the\r\nthousands of captive Germans. The detail set out in high spirits looking\r\nforward to doing a brisk business in souvenirs; already reports have\r\ncome in to the effect that buttons and shoulder-straps may be had in\r\nexchange for a cigarette, and a ring for a sack of five-cent “smoking.”\r\n\r\nThe inhabitants of Saint Mihiel, they say, were terror-stricken at the\r\nsight of the Americans. When our troops first entered the town they\r\nbelieved the city had been retaken. The Americans, they thought, were\r\nAustrians. No one in Saint Mihiel had ever seen an American; they hadn’t\r\neven known America was in the war!\r\n\r\nBut even in Saint Mihiel I don’t believe that there was any greater joy\r\nthan the joy that was here in our own kitchen. Madame who helps us with\r\nthe dishes at the hut is the daughter of the refugee schoolmaster, a\r\nshy, sensitive, appealing little woman, girl-like in spite of her\r\nhalf-grown daughter. When we told her that the salient had been taken\r\nshe went white and trembled. And what of Vieville? she begged; Vieville,\r\nher own little village? We got the map and showed it to her. Sure\r\nenough, there was Vieville and the new line stretching the other side of\r\nit! It was true past doubting. Madame shivered. “I don’t know whether to\r\nlaugh or to cry,” she told us and there were sobs in her voice while she\r\nsmiled at us. She tried to go on with scrubbing the floor, but she\r\ncouldn’t. Would we mind if she ran home for a minute? She must tell the\r\nnews to Papa and Maman. But certainly, stay as long as you like! we told\r\nher. In an hour she was back again, to go about her work in a dazed\r\nuncertain fashion, smiling tremulously while the tears stood in her\r\neyes. We must get someone to take her place at the canteen, she told\r\nus,—they would be going back to Vieville right away. It was plain to see\r\nthat she would have liked to start that very moment. We said nothing. Of\r\ncourse it was impossible. Vieville though liberated was close to the\r\nlines. When I looked at Madame so happy, so confidently eager to return\r\nto her home, I sickened to think of the ruin that probably awaited her.\r\nHow do they have the courage to face it, these French people? I thought\r\nof the words of the old schoolmaster: “We are living under tension now,\r\nit is the strain that keeps us up. When the war is over there will be a\r\nterrible reaction.” They have been brave, so brave, these peasant\r\nvillagers, but how will they bear the future? Where will they be swept\r\nwhen they are caught in the fearful ebb of that reaction?\r\n\r\nAlready odd-looking little German narrow-gauge engines and freight cars\r\nhave begun to appear in the yards, part of the Saint Mihiel booty. It\r\ndoes the eyes good to look at them.\r\n\r\nOne doesn’t want to hope too greatly, but is it possible that this may\r\nbe the beginning of the end?\r\n\r\n\r\nAbainville, September 18.\r\n\r\nLast night they bombed Gondrecourt. We were startled out of our sleep by\r\nthe explosions. Lying in bed I could hear the angry growling gr-gr-gr\r\nwhich distinguishes the German plane, as it flew over Abainville headed\r\nback towards the lines. Would it drop another bomb? It seemed to take an\r\ninterminable time to pass over us. Finally the growling hum grew faint,\r\ndied away. Then the real excitement of the night began. Swarming into\r\nthe streets, men, women and children, they proceeded to turn the\r\noccasion into a social event. Standing in the square in the moonlight,\r\nall talking at once and all talking at the top of their voices, they\r\ndiscussed, narrated, compared, commented, sympathized, while high above\r\nall the din I could hear Madame’s voice in semi-hysterical outbursts of\r\nemotion. How they could find so much to say about it I can’t imagine. If\r\nHindenburg’s whole army had suddenly appeared in Gondrecourt they\r\ncouldn’t have been more excited. I went to sleep and left them still\r\nbusy analyzing, as I took it, their psychological reactions.\r\n\r\nThis morning we learned that the bombs, falling at the edge of the town,\r\nhad injured nothing except a few trees.\r\n\r\n“What would you do if they should start to bomb Abainville?” I asked\r\nMadame when she brought me my morning toast and chocolate.\r\n\r\n“I? I would go to the church.”\r\n\r\n“What you, the infidel! You who never go to mass!”\r\n\r\n“I know.” Madame smiled a little sheepishly. “And yet all the same, one\r\nwould feel safer there.”\r\n\r\nAt the canteen a lieutenant who was just finishing his course at\r\nGondrecourt came in.\r\n\r\n“Nobody can imagine who should have wanted to bomb the school,” he\r\ndeclared, “unless it was some former pupil.”\r\n\r\n“Why I was told that the Gondrecourt School was the ranking school of\r\nFrance!” I exclaimed.\r\n\r\n“Made a mistake in the last syllable,” he responded sourly, “it should\r\nhave been spelled e-s-t.”\r\n\r\nBut if the inhabitants of Abainville have experienced no losses through\r\nair-raids yet, they have nevertheless, suffered a minor casualty.\r\nVictor, the town simpleton, the genial, harmless Victor, was knocked\r\ndown by a passing automobile yesterday and became separated from his\r\nleft ear in the ensuing confusion. Poor wretch! I saw him this morning\r\nhobbling down the street with a cane, his head swathed in bandages, but\r\nthe same old cheerful smile on his half-wit face, as he cocked one eye\r\nwarily on the look-out for approaching autos. Meanwhile a heated\r\ncontroversy is being waged between the medical officers of Abainville as\r\nto whether or not that ear might after all have been saved.\r\n\r\n\r\nSaint Malo, Brittany, September 23.\r\n\r\nToday I took tea with a Baroness, not only I, but about eighty odd\r\nmembers of the A. E. F. here _en permission_ like myself. Our hostess\r\nwas an American lady, the widow of a French Baron; the tea a weekly\r\nparty held at her Château out in the country, to which all boys on leave\r\nin this Brittany area are invited.\r\n\r\nWe took the funny little narrow-gauge train from Saint Malo, a “mixed”\r\ntrain and so crowded by the tea party that the boys must ride in the\r\nbaggage car and on the flat freight cars, and started our journey out to\r\nChâteauneuf. The feature of the train trip was the blackberries. Here in\r\nBrittany these grow all along the roadsides, the bushes topping the\r\nnarrow earth-covered walls like dykes that serve for fences. Strangely\r\nenough in this land of thrift, the blackberries go untouched, untasted.\r\nA Frenchman who lectured to us last spring declared that as a child he\r\nwas warned not to eat them: they would give him lice, he was told. This,\r\nhe explained, was the method which French parents took to dissuade their\r\nchildren from eating berries which, growing along the roadsides, would\r\nbe full of dust—a quaint scruple to find among people ordinarily so\r\nsuperior to sanitary considerations! But the Americans had no such\r\nsuperstitions; at every cross-roads stop we made, the boys swarmed off\r\nthe cars and fell upon the wayside bushes. I tasted some that one of the\r\nboys brought back for me. Compared to our blackberries at home they were\r\nflat and flavorless, but anyway they were fruit and they were free and\r\nthat was all the A. E. F. demanded.\r\n\r\nArrived at Châteauneuf, we must first file through the reception room\r\nwhere each and all of us shook hands with the Baroness, a gracious,\r\nstately old lady dressed in black, and then out upon the lawn beyond the\r\nlong ivy-covered, many-gabled house, to sit upon the grass and drink our\r\ntea. But tea was a misnomer unless it might have been the sort which the\r\nEnglish call “high tea,” it was a supper; salad, sandwiches, buttermilk\r\nand fruit punch served on real china plates and in dainty goblets. Many\r\na covetous eye I saw fixed on the silver forks with the coronets\r\nengraved on them, while the whispered word “souvenir” caught my ear, but\r\nto the boys’ credit I am glad to say that, as far as I know, they one\r\nand all resisted this temptation.\r\n\r\nAfter supper the boys sang and then we were invited to go through the\r\nhouse and wander about the grounds and garden. Coming back to the house\r\nafter having made the rounds, the boy who was with me suddenly stopped\r\nstock-still.\r\n\r\n“Well I’ll be darned!”\r\n\r\nBefore us wound a tiny stream and perched on its bank an old, old\r\npeasant woman was busy scrubbing what was evidently the Château wash.\r\nThe boy turned and looked at me despairingly, “And for all that’s such a\r\nfine house,” he groaned, “I suppose there ain’t so much as a speck of\r\nplumbing in the whole blamed building!”\r\n\r\nOn the lawn we found games were in progress. All the youngsters from the\r\nneighborhood had assembled to watch the Americans at the tea party. At\r\nfirst they had hung shyly on the outskirts, but now a lad from the air\r\nservice had started them to romping. Taking hold of hands a long line of\r\nthese little gamin would pursue a soldier victim, encircle him, bring\r\nhim to earth, then pile on him, holding him a helpless prisoner until he\r\nbought his liberty with a ransom of cigarettes, gum or coppers. It was a\r\nwonderful game for the children but I could not help but watch with\r\napprehension, every time there was a pig-pile, to see where all those\r\nwooden shoes would land.\r\n\r\nComing home, we walked to the little fishing village next door and took\r\nthe train there. As this visit to the village is also a weekly affair,\r\nall the inhabitants were on their door-steps to greet us, the women with\r\ntheir red cheeks, dressed invariably in black dresses and little stiffly\r\nstarched net caps. We went into the church with its array of votive\r\nofferings in the shape of tiny models of fishing boats and then, on our\r\nway to the station, stopped to view, over the hedge, the picture-book\r\ngarden of one old fisherman in which the trees and shrubs were all\r\nclipped and trained into the quaintest shapes—peacocks and animals and\r\nlittle ships. As the crowd moved on I lingered. An old man leaning on a\r\ncane, who had been watching from the roadside, stepped forward and spoke\r\nto me. He was the owner of the garden. He wanted to express to me his\r\ngratitude to America, America who had saved France! “_Ah! Vive\r\nl’Amérique!_” The old fellow’s tribute, unsolicited and unpremeditated\r\nevidently, touched me deeply.\r\n\r\n\r\nAbainville, October 4.\r\n\r\nWhile I was away it seems several things occurred. For one, we lost\r\nNanny. Whether some enterprising mess sergeant thought the day’s menu\r\nwould be improved by the addition of kid pie, whether some French family\r\nlured her away to be interned in their back yard, or whether, as one\r\nmight more darkly suspect, the Adjutant had something to do with the\r\nmatter; nobody knows. The bare fact confronts us: Nanny has disappeared.\r\n\r\nWe have also lost one of our most picturesque customers. This was a\r\nhandsome young Greek with a beautiful curled mustache, named Niccolo. He\r\nused to hold up the chocolate line, while, his eyes fairly shooting\r\nfire, he rolled up his sleeves and showed me the scars of the bayonet\r\nwounds which he received fighting the Turks. “The German, he just the\r\nsame the Turk! I tella the Captain he letta me go front, killa ten,\r\ntwenty, hundred Germans!” Why such a bloodthirsty soul as his should be\r\ncribbed, cabined and confined in an engineer regiment, he never\r\nexplained. Just before I went away on leave a detail of prisoners from\r\nthe guard-house arrived at the hut one morning to scrub the floor. To my\r\nregret I noticed Noccolo was among them. Niccolo, however, did not seem\r\nto mind, he was quite happily occupied with telling the others how the\r\nwork should be done.\r\n\r\n“That feller’s nuts,” complained a fellow-prisoner to me, “he spends all\r\nhis time when he’s in the brig, tryin’ to read the Bible to us.”\r\n\r\nWhile I was away they sent him to the Gondrecourt hospital on suspicion\r\nof insanity. The other night he escaped and made his way back to\r\nAbainville clad in his hospital pajamas, only to be caught and taken\r\nback again. Poor Niccolo with his beautiful mustache and his fiery\r\nspirit! I am sorry he never had the chance to get those Germans.\r\n\r\nWorst of all, the Y. is in disgrace with the officers. It came about\r\nthrough the matter of seats at the movies. The officers wanted to come\r\nto the shows and they also wanted seats reserved for them; naturally\r\nthey wanted the best seats. Now this is always a vexed and delicate\r\nproblem in a hut, for if the officers ask for reserved seats one can’t\r\nvery well refuse them, and yet to grant them is to raise resentment\r\namong the men. When I left the matter was hanging at loose ends. Shortly\r\nafterwards our Secretary, who is more distinguished for sentimentality\r\nthan tact, had an inspiration; he would put it up to the men.\r\nUndoubtedly when the case was laid before them, their nobler natures\r\nwould be touched and they would discern that it was their patriotic duty\r\nto voluntarily relinquish the best seats in the house to their military\r\nsuperiors. So one night just as the show was due to start the Secretary\r\nwalked out onto the stage and made his little speech, ending with the\r\nappeal:\r\n\r\n“And now boys, where shall we put the officers?”\r\n\r\nA perfect roar answered him. “Put ’em on the roof! Put ’em on the roof!”\r\n\r\nIt was frightfully embarrassing. The officers were furious. They\r\nwithdrew and called a mass-meeting to consider the matter. What the\r\nexact statute that covered the case was I don’t know. I suppose the\r\ncrime was one of a sort of military _lèse Majesté_. Anyway the Secretary\r\nhad indisputably laid himself liable to a court-martial. In the end,\r\nhowever, the officers decided that as long as the case was one of\r\nstupidity rather than malice, they would let the Secretary go with a\r\nwarning.\r\n\r\nAnd now they have stationed spotters among us! The hut, it seems, has\r\nproved to possess an all too potent charm for boys who should by rights\r\nbe engaged at “pick and shovel” and other uninviting but necessary\r\noccupations. In view of this the authorities have taken drastic action;\r\npasses must now be issued to the boys to allow them to enter the hut\r\nduring work hours, and alas for the unhappy lad who ventures in without\r\na permit, the lynx-like eye of the amateur detective detail is sure to\r\nlight upon him!\r\n\r\n\r\nAbainville, October 11.\r\n\r\nNanny has returned! She was found tethered in a back-yard in a nearby\r\nvillage. Since the French household which claimed her as their lawful\r\nproperty refused to relinquish her peacefully, she was taken by storm.\r\nThere was a scrimmage, the neighbors rallied to their friends’\r\nassistance. But the two lads who had been the discoverers managed to\r\nbreak away bearing the struggling Nanny with them and, followed by the\r\nwhole village shouting “Stop thief!” gained their truck and rolled\r\ntriumphantly away. No longer, however, does Nanny wander at large,\r\ninnocently trimming the villagers’ cabbage rows, or slipping slyly into\r\nthe Adjutant’s office to sample his latest orders. Nanny is under guard.\r\nThe engineers are taking no chances.\r\n\r\nYesterday we acquired a kitten,—a wild-eyed yellow scrap brought in last\r\nnight by a lad as an offering. The boys immediately christened her “The\r\nO. D. Cat.” Every time I give her a caress some one of the boys leaning\r\nover the counter is sure to remark: “Gee, wish I was a cat!”\r\n\r\n“But what shall I feed her?” I questioned, thinking of the difficulty of\r\nfresh milk.\r\n\r\n“Corn willy and cognac! What else would you give an O. D. cat?” they\r\nchorused.\r\n\r\n“And where shall she spend the night?”\r\n\r\n“I’ll keep her for you ma’am,” volunteered a brawny Texan. “She’ll sleep\r\nright in the bunk longside o’ me.”\r\n\r\nThis morning the canteen was full of tales of the night. “Yes sir! he\r\ntied her up to a post with a rope as big around as your arm! An’ the\r\npore cat nearly hanged herself. She hollered all night long!”\r\n\r\nThis the Texan emphatically denied; he had a tale all of his own to tell\r\nhowever.\r\n\r\n“There was a mouse last night in the barracks. It was the littlest mouse\r\nyou ever seen, but it chased that cat all around them barracks. Yes\r\nma’am, it sure did run that cat ragged!”\r\n\r\n“Did you give her any breakfast?” I asked, disdaining any comment on his\r\nstory.\r\n\r\n“Sure ma’am! I gave her a saucerful of cognac.”\r\n\r\n“You never did!”\r\n\r\n“Yes, an’ it did that cat good, it did. Soon’s she’d lapped up that\r\nsaucer; ‘Bring on your mouse!’ she says.” He shook his head\r\nreflectively. “My, but that cat sure was feelin’ its strength this\r\nmornin’!”\r\n\r\n“Waste cognac on a cat! That’s a likely story for that guy to be\r\ntelling!” was the single comment of the bystanders.\r\n\r\nRight here I wish to record a formal apology to the Secretary at X who\r\nsold me the six-franc eggs a month ago. Today I was talking to the Top\r\nSergeant whom I encountered on my way home and who carried my basket for\r\nme. From something he let fall I now more than suspect it was he who\r\naccounted for that twenty-fourth egg!\r\n\r\n\r\nAbainville, October 16.\r\n\r\nHis real name, of course, is Horace but since Madame refers to him as\r\n’Oreece, as ’Oreece he must go,—’Oreece is our new detail. He is\r\ncautious, conscientious and slow. If ’Oreece ever showed signs of having\r\nspunk enough to do something that was really bad, I would feel that\r\nthere was hope for him. Madame, who adores the Infant, is very cold to\r\n’Oreece. The other day she requested him to save her all the cigar stubs\r\nhe found while sweeping. She wanted them for an old derelict of a\r\nFrenchman who is a sort of scavenger around camp. Poor old papa could\r\nsmoke the butts nicely in his pipe she declared. But ’Oreece was so\r\ndisobliging as to turn his nose up at their proposal. Anyway ’Oreece\r\ncuts the bread for the jam-sandwiches very, very nicely.\r\n\r\nThree nights ago we had an air-raid alarm. The evening’s programme was\r\nover but the hut was still full of boys. Suddenly without any warning,\r\nall the lights went out. We looked out the door, the camp was in total\r\ndarkness. In the machine-gun pit nearby we could hear quick excited\r\norders interspersed with curses,—the gunners were getting ready to stand\r\noff the aeroplanes. The boys left the hut. We waited for a while and\r\nthen, getting tired of the dark, went home. The planes didn’t show up; I\r\nwent to bed feeling that it had been a case of Hamlet without Hamlet.\r\n\r\nLast night we were in the middle of a movie show when a shattering\r\nexplosion sounded outside. Back in the kitchen where I was serving hot\r\nchocolate to the Tea Room line, everyone started and stared. Was it a\r\nraid? Surely that was a bomb! There was another explosion. Then the\r\nlights went out. So it was the real thing! I seized the Cash-box and\r\nstood pat. Another crash; instantly outside there was a stampede. In the\r\ndark it was impossible to see just what was happening, but from the\r\nsounds it appeared that about seven hundred pairs of hob-nailed shoes\r\nwere doing double-quick time out the doors. In less time than one could\r\nbelieve the auditorium was empty. I heard Madame’s voice behind me in\r\nstaccato exclamations. Somebody scratched a match and lit a candle, a\r\nlittle group of boys were still standing at the window waiting for their\r\nchocolate, their faces looked a bit white I thought. Then the Infant put\r\nhis head out the kitchen door:\r\n\r\n“Why, the lights in camp are all on!” he exclaimed.\r\n\r\nA boy came up to the window. “They’re practising at the school,” he told\r\nus. “I heard the other day that they were going to pull some stunts in\r\nthe trenches tonight.”\r\n\r\n“So that was it!”\r\n\r\nThe lights flashed on.\r\n\r\n“But why did they go out?” I asked confused. Nobody could explain it.\r\n\r\nAt that moment ’Oreece drifted into the kitchen, he wore a very pale and\r\napologetic grin.\r\n\r\n“’Oreece!” I gasped, “Did you—”\r\n\r\n“I turned the lights off,” he admitted. “I knew where the switch was. I\r\nthought it was a raid.”\r\n\r\nI glared disgusted: “And a nice night’s work you’ve done!”\r\n\r\nMy friend the Texan strolled up to the deserted counter.\r\n\r\n“I met ’em all coming down the road,” he remarked. “Gee, but it was like\r\nthe retreat of a whole division!”\r\n\r\nToday the boys have been asking to tease me: “Where were _you_ in the\r\nGreat Air-Raid?”\r\n\r\n“I? Oh, I was under the kitchen-table,” I reply.\r\n\r\n\r\nAbainville, October 23.\r\n\r\nThe Chief has just brought me great news. I am to have a hut all of my\r\nown. I am to be head cook, bottle-washer, and grand high secretary all\r\nin one. And I am to go out into the wilds of France and start a new hut\r\nalone.\r\n\r\nIt seems there is an ordnance depot at a village called Mauvages about\r\nsix miles north of here. The camp itself is small, some two hundred men,\r\nbut the town has a large billeting capacity and additional bodies of\r\ntroops will be stationed there from time to time. The C. O. of the\r\nAmmunition Reclamation Camp,—that is its official title,—has requested\r\nthat a hut be established there. With the personnel in its present state\r\nno man secretary, says the Chief, can be spared, but if I care to\r\nundertake the job on my own I am welcome to it. And if after two months\r\nor so of solitary confinement “out in the sticks,” as the boys say, I\r\nget to hankering too badly for the flesh-pots of civilization, why they\r\nwill arrange to have me relieved. Need I say that I snapped up the offer\r\non the spot? I had asked to be transferred from Abainville some while\r\nago, as the conditions here have been none too congenial, but to have a\r\nhut all of my own is beyond any luck that I had dared dream.\r\n\r\nI would like to sling my old kit bag over my shoulder, tuck a chocolate\r\ncontainer under one arm and a case of cigarettes under the other, and\r\ncatch the first truck that passes bound northward for Mauvages. But it\r\nseems they won’t let me go until a New Lady comes here to take my place.\r\nThey have telegraphed to the office at Nancy. If the New Lady doesn’t\r\ncome quick, I have a good mind to go A. W. O. L. and start my canteen\r\nwilly-nilly.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile I am planning plans. Because of the grey chill days of winter\r\nI am going to paint my hut inside the brightest sunshiny yellow I can\r\nfind, hang it with orange curtains, and then in honor of the ordnance,\r\nchristen it the Pumpkin Shell!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VI: MAUVAGES—THE ORDNANCE\r\n\r\n\r\nAbainville, October 26.\r\n\r\nI have been to Mauvages; a reconnoitering expedition. As regards the\r\ntown the most striking feature about it is the Egyptian Fountain. A\r\nsomewhat startling structure to come upon in a little French mudpie\r\nvillage, it stands in the centre of the town and consists of the façade\r\nof a temple in front of which towers an ancient God of the Nile—or so I\r\ntake him—in dull green bronze, pouring from pitchers held in either hand\r\nclear streams of water into a broad semi-circular basin. Behind the\r\ncolumns is another pool, this one for the village washerwomen: a\r\ncleverly conceived arrangement, for every passing stranger must stop to\r\nstare at the fountain and this in turn affords the washerwomen the\r\nopportunity to stare at him.\r\n\r\nAround two sides of the town curves the canal along whose placid surface\r\nthe slow barges occasionally pass. They tell me that some very beautiful\r\nwomen go by on these canal boats, but I suspect that the reason that\r\nthey seem so beautiful is just that they do go by—the lure of the\r\nunobtainable. At the south end of the town the canal disappears into a\r\nhill-side, four miles to the southwest it appears again; a rather\r\nremarkable, and in view of the fact that in the most piping times of\r\npeace the traffic on the canal never exceeded four barges each way a\r\nday, inexplicably extravagant feat of engineering. Every now and then a\r\nlittle crowd of ordnance boys will take a notion to walk through the\r\ntunnel which has a path cut at one side, an excursion which must be\r\nunspeakably dreary as the whole length is quite unlighted and the air\r\ndamp and close beyond anything. More than once on these excursions a boy\r\nhas fallen into the canal and had to be fished out again.\r\n\r\nMy hut-to-be is on the further edge of town in the centre of a beautiful\r\nopen green field like a lawn. Just behind it is a large ruined stone\r\nhouse which the boys use as a background against which to take pictures\r\n“at the front” and on one side is a lovely tall wayside cross and a tiny\r\nchapel, the smallest I have ever seen, almost hidden in a little grove\r\nof bushes. The hut is a French recreation barracks; long, low, covered\r\nwith black tar paper, the windows filled with grimy cloth, it is\r\ncomprised of four walls, a roof, a tiny stage and a mud floor,—a good\r\nmud floor, the best mud floor, I am assured, in this part of France.\r\n\r\nAs for my billet, I am to lodge, it seems, with Monsieur le Curé. He was\r\nout when I called but the Major du Cantonment and Madame the Caretaker\r\nsettled things between them. What Monsieur le Curé will say when he come\r\nhome and discovers that _une demoiselle Américaine_ is to live _chez\r\nlui_, I don’t know, but as Monsieur le Major himself suggested it, it\r\nmust be in accordance with the clerical proprieties.\r\n\r\nThe Curé’s mansion is a rather stately, gloomy square house set back\r\nfrom the street with a rose-garden edging the path in front. My room has\r\na Juliet balcony with a view of the Egyptian Fountain, the ancient\r\nchurch and a scrap of rolling hills beyond. Breakfasts I have arranged\r\nto take with Madame the Caretaker who lives several doors down the\r\nstreet, dinners and suppers I am to eat by courtesy of the C. O. at the\r\ncamp.\r\n\r\nWhen I returned tonight I told my landlady of my plans. Her eyes fairly\r\ndanced with mischievous glee.\r\n\r\n“Oh la la! You and the Curé!” she cried. “_Le diable avec le bon Dieu!_\r\nIt will be necessary for you to become a good Catholic, say your\r\nprayers, and go to mass every morning. Who knows? Perhaps you may end by\r\nbecoming a _religieuse_.”\r\n\r\n\r\nMauvages, November 2.\r\n\r\nWe are building. This proves to be a painful process, consisting largely\r\nof discovering what you can’t have and what you will have to do without.\r\nFor instance, it appears that there is not enough lumber to be had in\r\nFrance to furnish me a complete floor, and I had set my heart on having\r\na nice, whole, _sweepable_ floor! French barracks, one should note in\r\npassing, are constructed of sections; the upper part of the walls\r\ncontaining the window sections being vertical, the lower sloping outward\r\nat an angle of about thirty-five degrees. By a process of begging,\r\nborrowing and salvaging—nobody says _steal_ any more these days,—I have\r\nvisions of getting the floor in the centre all filled in, but for the\r\nedges, under the sloping sides, I am afraid there is no hope. But I’m\r\nnot going to mind, I tell the boys; I shall start a series of war\r\ngardens in the little mud-plots, cabbages in number one, brussels\r\nsprouts in number two, and violets just for my own satisfaction in\r\nthree. And the boys can take turns hoeing them.\r\n\r\nFor the rest, we have cut a door in the side for general entrance, the\r\noriginal one being reserved for cooks, colonels and K. P.s, and across\r\nthe front end opposite the stage we have constructed our store-room,\r\nkitchen and canteen. A lattice is all that separates the kitchen from\r\nthe counter; this is so, in order to facilitate social intercourse\r\nbetween the cook and the customers, and also to enable the secretary, no\r\nmatter if she is engaged in stirring the chocolate or washing the\r\ndishes, to keep a weather eye on what is going on outside. But the\r\ntriumph of my hut-plan is the window-seat. Half-way down the hut we have\r\na stove, a stove which looks as big as an engine-boiler, a stove which\r\nmakes the eyes of all beholders fairly pop with admiration. “That’s a\r\nreal stove,” say the boys. “That ain’t no frog stove I’ll tell the\r\nworld!” And back of the stove we have a seat three sections long against\r\nthe wall. Wonderful to say that seat is comfortable and what’s more it\r\nhas sofa-cushions. “What are those pillers for?” demanded one boy\r\nsuspiciously. “Are they for the officers to sit on?”\r\n\r\n“D’you know what this is?” asked a boy today as he luxuriously stretched\r\nhis length on the window-seat. “This is the Lounge Lizard’s Roost.” So\r\nthe Lounge Lizard’s Roost it is.\r\n\r\nThe yellow curtains are already up in place. They give a rather stunning\r\neffect against the black tar paper when the æroplane camouflage curtains\r\nare let down. In each space between the windows we have tacked one of\r\nthat gorgeous series of French railway posters, so my hut is brave with\r\ncolor, tawny orange, sharp blues, and shadowy purples.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile the whole French populace has called, singly or in crowds, in\r\norder to see just what is going on. As for the children, I am sure they\r\nmust have declared a school holiday in honor of us. The whole concern is\r\nevidently a bit puzzling to the French mind; but they have solved the\r\nriddle by terming the hut a “_coopératif_,” and so I let it rest.\r\n\r\nBut you will be wondering how _le diable_ is contriving to live with _le\r\nbon Dieu_.\r\n\r\nMonsieur le Curé is quite old. There is something stern and something\r\ntragic in his face, with all his urbane graciousness. He is a refugee\r\nfrom the devastated area and like myself a lodger in the house, whose\r\nowners have fled this zone of armies. Monsieur le Curé was a captive for\r\nsix months with the Germans and the desolate confinement wrought a\r\nlittle on his mind; “At times he is absent,” says Madame the Caretaker.\r\nThis morning I stopped and chatted with him at his door downstairs, he\r\ncalled me in to show me “a souvenir of his captivity,” a little\r\ndirty-white tin basin out of which as prisoner he ate. “I learned to\r\nsmoke then,” he told me. “There was nothing to do the whole day long but\r\nsit and smoke and wait for the clock to strike.” Tonight I am going to\r\ntake him a little gift of American tobacco.\r\n\r\nI am planning a house-warming with which to formally open the hut.\r\n\r\n\r\nMauvages, November 6.\r\n\r\nWe didn’t have that house-warming. Even as we were finishing the hut all\r\nhands came down with the flu. Curiously enough it hit the camp all in a\r\nheap after dinner. Thirty per cent of the boys, the two officers, the\r\nbuilding detail and myself were all laid low between one and six\r\no’clock. Fortunately it was the lightest sort of an epidemic, a mere\r\n_soupçon_ as it were, in every case. I merely retired to my bed for a\r\nday and a half and refused to eat. On the third day, which was\r\nyesterday, I crawled back to the canteen. It was a case of pipe all\r\nhands on deck and stand to the counter. Two companies of engineers had\r\narrived in the night. They were back from an advanced station just\r\nbehind the lines and they were starved for chocolate and cigarettes. Two\r\nmonths ago they left Abainville, green troops, just over, now they are\r\nseasoned veterans, in proof of which they carry souvenirs salvaged from\r\nGerman dugouts. I heard all about these souvenirs, as I was taking\r\nbreakfast, from the lips of an excited Neighbor Woman. From the list of\r\nunwarlike trophies which she rattled off I gleaned umbrellas and a\r\nwall-clock; but the best was reserved for me when I reached the canteen.\r\nOne of the boys had met one of these same engineers toiling up the hill\r\nfrom the railroad with a large upholstered armchair on his back.\r\n\r\n“You can’t imagine,” he complacently replied to his gaping questioners,\r\n“how nice it is, at the end of a hard day’s work, to be able to sit down\r\nand smoke one’s pipe in real comfort.”\r\n\r\nUp and down the street are heaps of pale-green cabbages. The field\r\nkitchens by the fountain are busy cooking them. The town is fairly\r\nsteeped in the odor of boiling cabbages. These are the famous German\r\ncabbages captured in the Saint Mihiel drive, and for the past two\r\nmonths, the engineers, they tell me, have had them boiled for dinner,\r\nfor supper and for breakfast, until it seems that they hate the Germans\r\nfor those cabbages as much as they hate them for the rape of Belgium and\r\nthe sinking of the Lusitania.\r\n\r\nAt the corner by the fountain this noon a lady stopped to speak to me.\r\nShe was tall and white-haired and bore herself with gracious dignity.\r\nShe had heard, she told me, that these men had just returned from\r\nHattonchatel. She was very anxious to learn something of the fate of a\r\nnearby town, Haumont by the lakes, where her aged sister had lived.\r\nSince the German invasion four years ago she had heard absolutely no\r\nword of her. Was the town in such a state that it was possible her\r\nsister might still be there, or had the inhabitants been herded off to\r\nGermany? I questioned several boys, finally I found a lad who spoke\r\nFrench. Yes he knew the town to which she referred. He had often\r\nobserved it from the height of a nearby hill,—it had been daily under\r\nshell-fire. Very sadly, but with her gracious sweetness undisturbed, the\r\nlady turned away.\r\n\r\n\r\nMauvages, November 9.\r\n\r\nLife is just one breathless bustle now-a-days. Hardly had we got our\r\nminds adjusted to the engineers when a whole battalion of\r\nmachine-gunners marched into town. From the moment they arrived it has\r\nbeen one interminable line from morning until night, demanding the Three\r\nC.s,—chocolate, cookies, and cigarettes. Luckily my closet was well\r\nstocked and so has stood the strain.\r\n\r\nAnd speaking of closets, I have acquired a skeleton in mine. It came\r\nabout through a sick soldier, an accommodating captain and an egg-nogg.\r\nThe sick boy I discovered in Madame the Caretaker’s stable while\r\nbreakfasting this morning. He was very miserable, Madame told me, and\r\nhad been quite unable to eat a thing for days. I stopped in at the\r\nstable and verified her words. The boy looked wretched.\r\n\r\n“Come to the canteen at ten o’clock and I’ll have something for you to\r\neat,” I told him. Then I begged a cup of fresh milk from Madame.\r\n\r\nThe Captain I discovered in front of my canteen counter, and knowing him\r\nto be a southerner and a gentleman, I summoned my courage and whispered\r\na petition for a few drops of something, from the flask he carried in\r\nhis pocket, to put in the egg-nogg for the sick boy. The Captain, who\r\nwas corpulent and dignified, in some embarrassment replied that he was\r\nunfortunately without anything at present, but that the lack would be\r\nimmediately supplied. He disappeared, returning to produce before my\r\nstartled eyes, from beneath his coat, a life-sized bottle labeled\r\ncognac. Then he invited himself into the kitchen to help make the\r\negg-nogg. He proved expert. I quaked fearing the customers would sniff\r\nthe cognac through the lattice-work. The sick boy came, turned out to be\r\none of the Captain’s own men. The Captain cocked an unsympathetic eye.\r\n\r\n“What’s the matter with you, Smith?” he questioned, “been drunk again?”\r\n\r\n“Captain,” I scolded horrified, “I won’t have any rough talk like that\r\nin my kitchen!”\r\n\r\nSmith indignantly denied the charge. He drank his egg-nogg and left\r\nlooking three shades happier.\r\n\r\n“Captain,” said I, “did you ever make an egg-nogg for one of your men\r\nbefore?”\r\n\r\n“Never,” replied the Captain with decision. He drained his own bowl and\r\ntook his departure. “I will leave the bottle behind,” he told me.\r\n\r\n“But I don’t want it!”\r\n\r\n“You might need it again,” he declared. And nothing could induce him to\r\nchange his mind.\r\n\r\nThat bottle weighs on my conscience like a crime. I have hidden the\r\nguilty thing in a corner of the store-room shelf behind some perfectly\r\ninnocent-looking bundles of stationery and a pile of safety razor\r\nblades. But out of sight it continues to haunt my mind. I feel as if I\r\nwere giving sanctuary to the devil. And, worst of all, I have a vision\r\nof coming into the hut some day to find that the bottle has been\r\ndiscovered and the whole Y. M. C. A. is on a jag.\r\n\r\n\r\nMauvages, November 11.\r\n\r\nIt isn’t true. It isn’t real. It can’t be that the war is really ended.\r\n\r\nThis morning I awoke to the sound of the most tremendous barrage I have\r\never heard. At this distance however it was almost more like a sensation\r\nthan a sound, a sort of incessant thrilling, throbbing vibration.\r\n\r\nThe question was on everybody’s lips: “Do you suppose they really _will_\r\nsign the armistice?” “It don’t sound much like peace this morning!”\r\nwould come the dubious reply. We have heard rumours just since\r\nyesterday, but in rumours we have so long ceased to put any faith! As\r\nthe morning wore on our skepticism grew. The almost unbroken\r\nreverberation frayed the nerves. As eleven o’clock drew near the tension\r\nbecame torture. Would the guns cease? Could they? It seemed as if they\r\nmust go on forever. The clock in the old grey church tower began to\r\nstrike the hour. I flung open the kitchen door. We all stood breathless,\r\nfrozen, listening. Ding-dong, ding-dong; through the notes of the bell\r\nwe could still hear the throbbing of the great guns. Eleven times the\r\nslow bell chimed, there was a heavy boom, one more, and then absolute\r\nsilence. We stared at each other blankly incredulous. “They’ve signed,”\r\nsaid a boy.\r\n\r\nI walked down the little lane that leads to the ammunition dump and\r\npicked a bunch of orange-scarlet berries. I wanted to be alone, to\r\nlisten. It was a day all pearl and lavender, a violet mist hung over the\r\nbrown hill-sides. No one passed on the road, there was not a sound of\r\nany sort that reached me, the world seemed to be asleep. The stillness\r\nwas terrifying. I waited, tense, not able to believe, expecting every\r\nmoment to have the silence broken by the resumption of the cannonade.\r\nThen as the minutes passed and still my strained ears could not catch so\r\nmuch as a whisper, I turned back and entered the little roadside Chapel\r\nin the Bush. There in its dim blue and silver solitude I knelt down\r\nbefore the little statue of Jeanne d’Arc and prayed.\r\n\r\nAt noon someone started the old church bell to ringing, it jangled\r\nfrantically for hours.\r\n\r\nI think we are all a little dazed. I for one have a curious feeling as\r\nif I had come up suddenly against a blank wall.\r\n\r\n\r\nMauvages, November 12.\r\n\r\nLast night we celebrated. The whole ordnance camp got out and set off\r\nflares and signal rockets from the dump, while two of the boys put over\r\na barrage with the machine-gun on the hill. And there was much\r\nchampagne. This morning the street is hung with flags,—I never knew\r\nbefore how thrilling the tricolor could be until I saw it like this,\r\nagainst the stone-grey of the old houses.\r\n\r\nA company of French cavalry is just passing through town. They are very\r\nbeautiful to look at, with their bright blue uniforms, their bright bay\r\nhorses, and the long slim lances which they carry in one hand, each with\r\na tiny pennant at the end. As each one comes into view down the street I\r\nthink; “Thank God, for one more Frenchman left alive.”\r\n\r\nThe boys have already begun to argue about the date on which they will\r\nreach home. But though the fighting may be over, there are long months\r\nstill ahead of us here I am sure. And now with the strain and the\r\nexcitement gone, France is bound to look greyer and muddier and more\r\nwhats-the-use to the boys than ever before. May Heaven help us all!\r\n\r\n\r\nMauvages, November 17.\r\n\r\nI want to make you acquainted with Bill and Nick, my two invaluable\r\nassistants. Bill is my official detail formally assigned. Nick is a\r\nvolunteer, his services a free-will offering proferred at such times as\r\nhe is not required in his regular capacity as guardian of the\r\nbath-house.\r\n\r\nBill is a lame tame giant six feet two and up. He slipped a cog in his\r\nknee one time while shuffling shells last summer and never got quite\r\nstraightened out again. Bill is my salvation. He redeems what would\r\notherwise be a desperate situation. For Bill has a Business Brain. If it\r\nweren’t for that, I believe I should be driven to the mad-house trying\r\nto balance the francs and centimes at the end of each week. Besides\r\nhaving a head for figures, Bill is an all round handy man with a turn\r\nfor inventions. When I come back to the hut after a morning expedition\r\nto Gondrecourt in quest of suppplies, I may or I may not find last\r\nnight’s dishes washed but I am pretty sure to find some wonderful new\r\ncontrivance added to my hut equipment. Bill has made me a stove-pipe out\r\nof a German powder can. Bill has installed an automatic closing\r\nattachment for the main door, which consists of a rope, a pulley, a\r\nstove grate and an excruciating squeak; the chief advantage of this\r\ninvention being the squeak which always betrays the sneak who tries to\r\nescape undetected in the middle of a prayer. Sometimes I think it hurts\r\nBill’s pride to have to take orders from a lady, especially one with\r\nsuch an unmathematical brain as I. Occasionally he lapses into a\r\nyou’re-only-a-little-girl-after-all sort of attitude and then I have to\r\nput on all my dignity and read the riot act to him. But when I hand in\r\nmy weekly cash sheets at Headquarters and the cashier there tells me\r\nthat my accounts are the best in the whole area, why Bill could have the\r\nwhole hut and everything in it.\r\n\r\nAs for Nick, if Bill is right hand man, why Nick makes a quite\r\nindispensable left, and this in spite of the fact that the poor fellow\r\nis almost blind. He got a crack in the back of his head from the corner\r\nof a case of “75s,” while unloading ammunition some two months ago,\r\nwhich affected the optic nerve. And though the doctor promises a partial\r\nrestoration of his sight, at present he must grope about in dark glasses\r\nand semi-darkness. Nick has a history. An orphan, educated for the\r\npriesthood, he ran away at the age of sixteen and started on the career\r\nof a cowboy. After having broken every bone in his body in the course of\r\nhis broncho-busting he rose to the heights of his profession and joined\r\nBuffalo Bill’s Wild West Show. Here he met his wife, a lasso and pistol\r\nexpert. While riding an “outlaw” in Madison Square Garden, he was thrown\r\nand had one of his legs badly smashed, which forced him to retire from\r\npublic life. After this he spent a couple of years as a bar-tender in\r\nNew York. In his spare moments, aided by his ecclesiastical Latin, he\r\nlearned practical chemistry from an old German druggist who kept shop\r\nnext door. Now in his civilian capacity Nick is consulting chemist for a\r\nBrooklyn laundry concern, while his wife conducts successfully a French\r\nmillinery store in Flatbush. So much for romance!\r\n\r\nNick is, I am quite sure, the politest Irishman in France. Moreover he\r\nis the darling of the feminine portion of the town. Partly by reason of\r\nhis blindness, which appeals to the quick sympathies of the Frenchwomen,\r\nand partly because of his unvarying courtesy, his kindliness and his\r\nquaint humour, he is the most sought-after man in Mauvages. He knows, I\r\nshould judge, some six words of French, but with these he manages to\r\n“get by.” And he is forever being invited out to supper.\r\n\r\nEvery morning between sweeping up and washing the dishes and waiting on\r\nthe counter we hold a coffee party in the kitchen; Bill and Nick and\r\nmyself and whoever else happens to be around. The party consists of\r\ncoffee with plenty of sugar and canned milk,—always a treat in the army\r\nas in the messes you must drink it plain;—and K. P. cookies. Now K. P.\r\ncookies, you must understand, are cookies from the end of the package\r\nthat the mouse didn’t eat. As there is considerable activity on the part\r\nof the mice these days there are any number of K. P. cookies. And yet I\r\nhave done my best. Pricked on by conscience I said to Nick day before\r\nyesterday, “Nick do you suppose you could get me a trap?”\r\n\r\n“Certainly Ma’am, I’ll buy one at the store.”\r\n\r\n“But wait a minute, do you know the word for mouse-trap?”\r\n\r\n“Don’t worry. That’s not in the least necessary.” And he set out for the\r\n_General Store Articles Militaire_ down the street.\r\n\r\nBut for once his sign language failed him. He was offered everything in\r\nthe store from a screw-driver to an egg-beater and only achieved the\r\ntrap finally by stumbling over one on the floor. It was a French trap to\r\nbe baited with flour and sewed up with thread; I looked at it\r\nskeptically, but the next morning we had caught a mouse. However today\r\nit was K. P. cookies as usual.\r\n\r\n“Bill,” I said, “you’ll have to borrow Iodine.” Iodine is the Medical\r\nSergeant’s cat.\r\n\r\n“Aw shucks,” says Bill, “Iodine is a frog cat. She wouldn’t look at a\r\nmouse unless you served it to her on a platter dressed with garlic.”\r\n\r\nBill says no home is complete without a dog. I quite agree with him.\r\nOnly, I say, we must catch him young so we can bring him up in the way\r\nhe should go. These French dogs for the most part seem to have neither\r\nmanners nor morals. So Bill is keeping an eye out for a likely puppy.\r\n\r\n“But,” he said, “when we close up here, the only way we’ll be able to\r\nsettle it between us will be to make him into sausages.”\r\n\r\nIf we ever do get a dog I think I shall call him “Tin Hat” just because\r\nevery other dog in the A. E. F. is named “Cognac.”\r\n\r\n\r\nMauvages, November 20.\r\n\r\nOur relations to the French populace are enough to try a diplomat.\r\nHardly a day passes in the hut but what some delicate social or ethical\r\nproblem arises.\r\n\r\nFirst, there is Louis, a most disreputable old scamp if there ever was\r\none. He keeps the café across the street and so is my deadly rival. The\r\nother day the old rascal appeared at my counter grinning from ear to\r\near, and demanded “_bonbons pour le rheum_,” producing, in witness of\r\nhis urgent need, a feeble and patently artificial cough. When I answered\r\nthat unfortunately we had none, he instantly substituted chocolate in\r\nhis request. Unable to resist the rapscallion’s grin I gave him a\r\nhandful, whereat in beaming gratitude he immediately invited me over to\r\nthe café to have a glass of wine at his expense. And when I hastily\r\ninformed him that I didn’t care for wine he genially amended the\r\ninvitation so that it stood, “glass of beer.” And now I am told by the\r\nboys that he has announced that I, forsooth, am his “fiancée!”\r\n\r\nBut chiefly there is Rebecca. We call her Rebecca because when Bill goes\r\nto the well to get a pail of water he usually happens to meet her there.\r\nRebecca is thin and dark and lively. Her English vocabulary includes\r\nsuch phrases as “beeg steef” and “Mek eet snappee!” She is, as the boys\r\nput it, “full of pep.” Rebecca has a little black and villainous-looking\r\nhusband who occasionally appears in town from the trenches, but for the\r\nmost part she is free to follow where her fancy leads. If it should ever\r\nlead her to confession I am afraid she would make the old Curé’s\r\neyebrows curl.\r\n\r\nBill’s acquaintance with Rebecca is entirely on business lines he wants\r\nme to understand. She does his laundry for him. “It’s all very well,” I\r\nsay, “to take her your washing, but why must you take her chocolates?”\r\nHe knows I disapprove. When he lingers too long on the water detail I\r\neye him severely on his return.\r\n\r\n“Bill, have you been hobnobbing with Rebecca?”\r\n\r\nBill grins admission.\r\n\r\nRebecca lives in a white little one story door-and-window house just\r\naround the corner on the Rue d’Eglise which I must pass going to my\r\ncanteen. And Rebecca keeps tab on the precise hour and minute at which I\r\nreturn to my billet under Bill’s escort every night. Going home one\r\nstormy night I took Bill’s arm. The next day Bill informed me that\r\nRebecca had advised him that such conduct, according to French notions,\r\nwas not quite _comme il faut_.\r\n\r\nBill, I find, is able to make an astonishing amount of conversation with\r\nhis “nigger French” that takes absolutely no account of moods, tenses,\r\nconjugations, declinations or any of the other stuff in grammar books.\r\nAnd I am afraid he understands a great deal that it would be just as\r\nwell he didn’t.\r\n\r\n“How did you learn it all?” I asked him.\r\n\r\nHe looked at me side-wise. “Rebecca gave me lessons,” he answered\r\ngrinning.\r\n\r\nLast night, as we passed Rebecca’s house, I noticed that her door was\r\nthe least bit ajar.\r\n\r\nAs Bill left me at my gate I admonished him; “Now don’t you stop to say\r\ngood-night to Rebecca.”\r\n\r\n“Gosh, no!” said Bill, “if I did I’m afraid I might have to hurry or I’d\r\nbe late for breakfast.”\r\n\r\nWhenever I meet Rebecca on the street she always bows to me most\r\nurbanely.\r\n\r\nNor is Rebecca all my concern in relation to Big Bill. There is also the\r\npretty girl who lives down the street who undoubtedly would not be\r\naverse to accompanying him to America. Bill stops at her house every\r\nnight in order to get a quart of fresh milk for the C. O.’s breakfast. I\r\nbid him be wary of these Franco-American alliances, citing horrible\r\nexamples I have known, such as the machine-gunner, for instance, who, in\r\norder to be in harmony with his future family-in-law, felt it incumbent\r\non him to appear at his wedding wearing a pair of wooden shoes; and of\r\nthe doughboy who married a widow with two children, and, since he knew\r\nno French and she no English, persuaded his company commander to detail\r\nan interpreter to live in the house with them for the first three days\r\nafter their marriage.\r\n\r\nNot many days ago a girl came to my kitchen door in company with a\r\nsoldier. She had a United States paymaster’s cheque which she wished to\r\nhave cashed. Afterwards I questioned Bill. It seems a lieutenant had\r\nmarried and afterwards divorced her. She was still drawing his\r\nallotment. She looked so thoroughly the peasant, bare-headed, in a shawl\r\nand shoddy skirt, with nothing to particularly distinguish her pretty\r\nbut inexpressive face, that I voiced my wonder to the boys.\r\n\r\n“Oh but you ought to see her when she gets dressed up!” they said.\r\n\r\n“Fine feathers don’t make fine birds,” I remind severely. “Bill, be\r\nwarned!”\r\n\r\n“Yes, but there’s Gaby,” Bill suggests. “What about her?” Now Gaby is\r\nthe little chauffeuse who has been driver for a French general three\r\nyears and who turns up periodically in town. She is quaint as a wood-cut\r\nand solemn as an owl, with her shock of bobbed hair and her great\r\nstaring child-like eyes. She sits at the mess table and never says a\r\nword but draws your glance irresistibly. Always she wears an odd little\r\nstraight-cut dress hanging just below her knees and a _croix de guerre_\r\npinned to her breast. Gaby killed a man with her car not long since and\r\nwas held a prisoner at Ligny-en-Barrois for ten days in consequence.\r\nGaby and one of the sergeants at the A. R. are undergoing all the woe\r\nand wonder of love’s young dream.\r\n\r\n“Oh well,” I say, “Gaby is different.”\r\n\r\nThis afternoon Rebecca appeared at the canteen and asked for Bill. She\r\nwas so elegantly attired that at first I didn’t know her. After a parley\r\nat the door, Bill, with an odd expression on his face, takes his\r\nsecond-best raincoat from the peg and hands it to her. I looked my\r\ninquiries. An old doughboy sweetheart of the lady’s, it appears, had\r\nreturned on leave and they were going travelling together.\r\n\r\n“Going off on a honey-moon with another feller, in my raincoat! Gosh,\r\nit’s a cruel war!” grinned Bill.\r\n\r\n\r\nMauvages, November 24.\r\n\r\nNow that the time is drawing on toward Christmas the boys,—bless\r\nthem!—are all wanting to send some remembrance to mothers, sisters,\r\nwives and sweethearts at home. But what to send has been the desperate\r\nquestion. One sort of goods and one only is offered for such purposes by\r\nthe French stores in this locality, a line of flimsy silk stuff,\r\nhandkerchiefs, scarfs and little aprons, machine-embroidered with gay\r\nflowers and each bearing the legend “Souvenir de France.” They are\r\nfragile slazy things, absurdly high-priced, inappropriate and often\r\nhideous. But to the boys they are altogether beautiful. After many\r\nrequests and inquiries I gave in. I went to Gondrecourt and purchased\r\nwhat I could find that was the least tawdry, the least exorbitant. I\r\nbrought them to the canteen; they proved so popular that three days\r\nafterward I had to make another trip to town to buy some more. Now we\r\ncarry a regular stock of fancy silk handkerchiefs and aprons in addition\r\nto the chewing tobacco and cigarettes. But here one is faced with a\r\ndelicate problem. Each handkerchief is embroidered with some such\r\nspecific legend as _To my Sweetheart_, _To My Dear Wife_, _To my Darling\r\nDaughter_,—I refused to consider the bit of lacy frippery marked _To my\r\nDear Son!_—and this complicates matters immensely I find. Somehow we\r\nalways manage to have a supply of Sweethearts on hand when a man is in\r\nquest of a Dear Wife and vice versa. In vain I artfully suggest that it\r\nwould be a pretty compliment to call one’s wife “Dear Sweetheart,” to\r\ntheir minds there seems to be something essentially compromising in such\r\na notion. Occasionally the reverse will work however, and a boy,\r\ngrinning and abashed, will select a handkerchief marked “Dear Wife” to\r\nsend to his sweetheart. Sometimes during these sales one’s faith in the\r\nsingle heartedness of Young America receives a shock, as when an\r\ninnocent-looking lad will blandly select half a dozen “Dear Sweethearts”\r\nand put each in a separate envelope to send to a different girl!\r\n\r\nSpeaking of souvenirs, there is a boy who acts as fireman on the dinky\r\nlittle engine that pulls the work-train on the narrow-gauge between\r\nMauvages and Sauvoy. He belongs to a regiment of engineers who served\r\nwith the British in Flanders for some eight months. While there he dug\r\nup enough dead Germans,—“You could always tell where they were buried\r\nbecause the grass grew so much greener there,” he explained,—and picked\r\nenough gold fillings out of their teeth, to make a whole match box full.\r\nHe was going to take it home and have a dentist put the gold in his\r\nteeth “for a souvenir,” but unluckily in the spring drive he lost all\r\nhis possessions and the match box with them. Now this, as Kipling would\r\nsay, is a true story.\r\n\r\n\r\nMauvages, November 30.\r\n\r\nLet me recount to you the gentle tale of the German prisoners and the\r\nThanksgiving movies, an incident which I consider a sort of sermon in a\r\nnutshell and a Warning to the Nations.\r\n\r\nUnluckily there is in this division a secretary who is a sentimentalist.\r\nHe has an idea that an important part of his object in France is “to\r\nenliven the long evenings of the French villagers,” and particularly\r\ndoes he consider it his Christian duty to do something to demonstrate\r\nhow much we love the poor German prisoners, those gentlemen who wear the\r\nbig P. G. for _Prisonnier de Guerre_ on their backs and “ought,” as the\r\nboys say, “to have an I in the middle.” There are several hundred of\r\nthem in a camp at Gondrecourt and they are, it is said, just as well\r\nhoused and fed as our boys, and not made to work nearly as hard.\r\n\r\nNow, as there was no other sort of entertainment available, I had set my\r\nheart on having movies in my hut on Thanksgiving. I had presented my\r\nrequest at the Headquarters office and understood the matter settled.\r\nBut the Sentimental Secretary it seems had made up his mind that the\r\npoor dear German prisoners must have a treat and, other schemes falling\r\nthrough, he also put in a request for the movies. There was only one\r\nportable machine in working order. Through some misunderstanding or\r\nsomething in the office, the P. G.s got the movies. To enlarge upon my\r\nsentiments when the news was broken to me Thursday morning or to record\r\nthe opinions expressed by the boys in regard to the matter, is not to\r\nthe purpose of this tale.\r\n\r\nFailing our show, all that I could manage in the way of celebration was\r\na little box of nuts and raisins tied up with a bit of red, white and\r\nblue ribbon for every man in camp. The mess sergeant, however, outdid\r\nhimself. Our Thanksgiving dinner was nothing less than a feast. For days\r\nthe A. R. jitney had been scouring the country for poultry. At last the\r\nsergeant had succeeded in getting enough for all. He did this by\r\nassembling specimens of the whole feathered tribe; turkey, duck, chicken\r\nand goose. And I had a slice of each. But for all that I didn’t enjoy\r\nthat dinner worth six-pence. Those movies were on my mind. I tried to\r\nthink of the touching gratitude of the German prisoners. Perhaps after\r\nall if one should pursue them with delicate attentions it might lead\r\nthem to see the error of their ways. Perhaps giving them a movie show\r\nwould inculcate, by example, a beautiful lesson of Christian charity and\r\nforgiveness. Who could tell what uplifting moral influence Charlie\r\nChaplin or Mutt and Jeff might exert?\r\n\r\nLast night was our regular movie-night. In the midst of preparing for\r\nthe show, Georges, the French operator, who was getting the machine\r\nready, Georges the little dandy, always nonchalant and blasé, came\r\ncharging back to the counter, his eyes as big as arc-lights. He thrust\r\nhis hands, which were full of cartridges, beneath my nose, fairly\r\ndancing on tip-toe in his excitement. He had found them in the carbide;\r\nwhen the carbide had gotten hot, “_Poof!_” he dramatized the wrecking of\r\nthe hut with explosive gestures. “_C’est les Boches!_ _Les cochons!_”\r\nNever again would he take his machine there, never, never!\r\n\r\nAs the machine had been left at the German Prison Camp after the\r\nThanksgiving show and then brought directly from there to Mauvages there\r\nseems little room for doubt that the prisoners had placed the shells\r\nthere. Of course, if there were any poetic justice in things, the\r\nSentimental Secretary himself would have been blown up by the Germans’\r\ncartridges, but unfortunately in real life things don’t happen that way.\r\n\r\n\r\nMauvages, December 3.\r\n\r\nThe French Army is in possession of Mauvages. A regiment of artillery\r\nmoved in on us yesterday afternoon. There seemed a never-ending line of\r\nthem as they crawled into town, the horses just barely able to drag the\r\nheavy pieces. There must have been a shocking shortage of fodder in the\r\nFrench Army; the poor beasts look wretched beyond words. The big guns\r\nare lined up all along the street. They look like great spotted lizards\r\nin their green and brown and yellow coats of camouflage. Each piece has\r\na girl’s name carved on the muzzle. The one in front of my canteen is\r\nMarthe, further up the street stand Lucile and Marie. We watched them as\r\nthey brought the guns into place, unhitched the teams and made their\r\npreparations to settle down and stay. Once settled, our perplexities\r\nbegan. Immediately they started to trickle into the canteen in search of\r\ncigarettes. To the first comers in a weak moment I slipped a few\r\npackages. That was enough. Thereafter it was just like flies to the\r\nmolasses jar, and then of course I had to harden my heart and say no.\r\nBut they wouldn’t take no for an answer. They begged, pleaded and\r\ncajoled. I posted a polite sign at the end of the counter explaining how\r\nthe canteen supplies had been brought into France without payment of any\r\nduty, under the strict agreement with the French Government that they\r\nwould be sold only to Americans. But they refused to read the sign. One\r\nhandsome brigadier stopped me on the street in order to present his\r\npetition. And at the canteen a little poilu with a round cherubic face,\r\nafter being refused some nine or ten times over at the counter, followed\r\nme out into the kitchen to urge his piteous plea. It was dreadful, it\r\nwas harrowing. I have never felt quite so mean about anything in all my\r\nlife.\r\n\r\nIn the evening we had billed a stereoptican lecture on London. Forseeing\r\nthat the poilus would form a large proportion of the audience, I tried\r\nto get an interpreter to explain the pictures in French to them but at\r\nthe last minute the interpreter failed me. Notwithstanding, the\r\nFrenchmen remained courteously quiet while the lecture lasted. But once\r\nit was finished the atmosphere of the hut underwent a change. The\r\nblue-coated figures who were swarming into the canteen now had evidently\r\nspent the earlier part of the evening in the cafés. I went out into the\r\ncentre of the hut to see what was going on; all about me stretched a\r\nswarm of poilus in a genial mood. The door squeaked open, a little\r\nsoldier came skipping into the hut. To my horror I saw he carried in one\r\nhand a tall tumbler and in the other a large bottle of Benedictine. The\r\nvictrola was jigging out a rag on the counter. Posing for a minute in an\r\nattitude reminiscent of the great Isadora, the little poilu proceeded to\r\ndance in time to the music, pirouetting on one toe as he waved the\r\nbottle and the tumbler above his head with Bacchanalian gestures. Then\r\nsuddenly he sat down at one of the tables and started to pour himself a\r\nglass. I swooped down upon him. It was _défendu_ I explained, strictly\r\nand absolutely _défendu_ to drink in this hut. He stared incredulous. I\r\nreiterated with emphasis. Finally he nodded sulkily and, slipping the\r\nbottle underneath his arm, turned away. Two minutes later I caught him\r\noffering a red-nosed friend a drink square in front of my counter. I\r\nflew to the attack again. I told him it was against the rules to so much\r\nas _bring_ wine into the hut. He held his ground defiantly. I wanted to\r\ntake the little wretch by his coat collar and march him out the door; I\r\nfelt I could have done it. Instead I plead, expostulated and commanded.\r\nA score of grinning poilus crowded about us: it was evidently as good as\r\na show to them. I entreated the little poilu please, _please_ to carry\r\nthe bottle out of the hut! “_Dehors!_ _Dehors!_ Outside!” they chorused\r\ngleefully. I exhausted my vocabulary, apparently without effect. The\r\nlittle poilu wasn’t used to taking orders from a girl, especially one\r\nwho spoke French so badly, but finally I won. “_Bon!_” he snapped\r\nexplosively, turned on his heel and marched out. I fled precipitately to\r\nthe kitchen and stayed there until closing time. I didn’t feel equal to\r\ncoping with any more tipsy poilus.\r\n\r\nIt’s curious how the whole character of a dwelling-place can change.\r\nWhen the priest and the cat and I are keeping house together, the old\r\nmansion is the dimmest, most decorous place imaginable. At night I let\r\nmyself in the dark front door, locking it carefully behind me,—Monsieur\r\nscolded me for leaving it unlocked once; I had left him, he said, at the\r\nmercy of the passersby!—then grope my way down the cold unlighted hall\r\nand up the steep stairs to my chilly room and to bed by one flickering\r\ncandle’s light. The place is as silent and lifeless as a tomb. Then new\r\ntroops come into town and suddenly everything is changed. The lower\r\nfloor is taken over for an officers’ mess and often too, for\r\nHeadquarters. Savory odors of cooking, warm smells mount up the dim\r\nstairway, candles gutter in niches in the passage-ways, smart-looking\r\nofficers in khaki or horizon-blue as the case may be, meet and salute\r\none in the hall. The tramp of booted feet, the ring of spurs, the clink\r\nof glasses, laughter, song, the piano played tumultuously sometimes late\r\ninto the night,—everything from Madelon to Mozart—and most startling,\r\nand incredible of all, the jangle of a telephone bell, installed for the\r\noccasion; for a few days we live in a strange bustling vivid world, then\r\non they move and we are left again to our silence and solitude.\r\n\r\nTonight as I was washing up for supper I was startled by a rap on my\r\ndoor. There stood Monsieur le Curé and a French officer. I had a bad\r\nmoment wondering what the cause of such a visitation might be. Was he\r\ngoing to turn me out of my billet perhaps? Or was he going to complain\r\nabout the treatment his men had received in the Y.? Monsieur le Curé was\r\nambling through a long and elaborate peroration. At first I could make\r\nno sense out of it, then suddenly I caught on. Monsieur le Capitaine was\r\na stamp collector. He wanted to know if I perhaps had some stamps _des\r\nÉtats-Unis_ which I could spare him!\r\n\r\nReports have come in tonight of friction between the French and American\r\nsoldiers in town, resulting in a number of scrimmages. The whole trouble\r\nsprings, I gather, from the eternal feminine and the native jealousy of\r\nthe male; the Fair Sex of Mauvages having made quite evident to the\r\npoilus their decided preference for the doughboys.\r\n\r\n\r\nMauvages, December 6.\r\n\r\nThe theatrical season at Mauvages has been inaugurated. The carpenters\r\nwere busy in the hut all day yesterday, hammering and sawing, making us\r\na roll curtain out of roofing paper, manufacturing foot-lights from\r\ncommissary candles and tin reflectors cut from the lining of tobacco\r\ncases. When the stage was done it was very gay. We had a red curtain\r\nacross the back, bright yellow wings, red and yellow draperies around\r\nthe proscenium arch, festoons of little flags strung across the top, and\r\na large American flag draped centre back. It wasn’t what we wanted, it\r\nwas just what, by hook or crook we could get, and the effect really\r\nwasn’t half as bad as it sounds.\r\n\r\nThe programme might be classed in two parts, rehearsed and impromptu.\r\nFor a starter we dropped a tear over Baby’s Prayer, that bit of\r\nninety-nine one-hundredths pure sentimentality, without which no\r\nprogramme in the A. E. F. is complete these days; after which we were\r\nadjured to “Pray for sunshine, But always be prepared for rain,”—a quite\r\nsuperfluous admonition in this part of France at this season of the\r\nyear!\r\n\r\n  “Put all your pennies on the shelf,\r\n  The almighty dollar will take care of itself.”\r\n\r\n“Humph!” grunted the boy next me, “I’ll bet it was a Jew wrote that.”\r\n\r\nFollowing the songs we heard Barney, the Poet Laureate of the Camp,\r\ncelebrate the deeds of the ordnance detachment in verse. At least we\r\nsupposed that was what it was, for Barney has a brogue all his own and\r\nif you get one word in ten you’re lucky. As the C. O. says, it is much\r\neasier to “_compree_” a Frenchman than it is to understand Barney.\r\n\r\nAfter Barney we had a sermon, a burlesque darky sermon preached by a\r\nblack-face comedian. As luck would have it, two real darkies from a\r\nlabor camp up the line slipped in at the back of the hut just as the\r\npreacher began. They took it all in deadly earnest, and warmed, I\r\nsuspect, by a glass at the corner café, they presently began to respond\r\nto the preacher’s exhortations with genuine religious fervor.\r\n\r\n“Dat’s so! You tell ’em bruder! Hallelujah! Bless de Lord!”\r\n\r\nThe audience up front, hearing a commotion and unluckily not catching\r\nthe comedy, hissed indignantly and the darkies, abashed, slunk out.\r\n\r\nOf course at the last moment some of our headliners failed to come\r\nacross. The mumps claimed our dramatic reader and our buck-and-wing\r\ndancer sent word, just as the curtain was going up, that in all the\r\ncamp, no shoes outside of hob-nails, large enough for him could be\r\nfound. But we made up for these defections by our impromptu acts. The\r\nmost surprising of these was the Little Fat Poilu. He popped up suddenly\r\nfrom Heaven knows where, a round rosy dumpling of a man with a shiny\r\nnose and a fat black beard, and offered his services. On his first\r\nappearance he played the violin with vim and spirit. Then in answer to\r\nthe applause he dropped his violin, seized the tall hat from the head of\r\nthe darky preacher, clapped it on his own, and bounced back onto the\r\nstage. The transformation was amazing. In an instant, instead of a poilu\r\nhe had become a jolly little bourgeois shopkeeper out for a stroll on\r\nthe boulevard. He proceeded to sing a comic song, a song with an\r\ninterminable number of verses, unquestionably very funny and in all\r\nprobability quite scandalous. The French portion of the audience was\r\ncharmed, they joined vociferously in the jiggy choruses, and when he had\r\ndone they insisted on another and another. For a while it looked as if\r\nFrance was going to run away with the programme, but finally the little\r\npoilu came to the end of his repertoire,—or of his breath maybe, and\r\nAmerica once more took the stage.\r\n\r\nToday we are living in an atmosphere of theatrical enterprise. Already\r\nthere are three or four “bigger and better” rival shows in process of\r\nincubation. What’s more, Barney is writing a play. He sits at one of the\r\ncanteen tables surrounded by a group of admiring would-be actors and\r\neach sheet, as he finishes it, is gravely handed around the crowd. So\r\nfar it seems to contain just three characters; Rose the beautiful\r\nstenographer, the villain landlord and the office boy. I am waiting in\r\nsuspense to see whether Barney’s masterpiece is going to turn out a\r\nmelodrama, a problem play or a dramatic treatise on the social and\r\npolitical wrongs of Ireland.\r\n\r\nThe French troops are moving tomorrow. Tonight the Little Fat Poilu came\r\nto bid us good-bye. When no one was looking I filled his pockets up with\r\ncigarettes.\r\n\r\n\r\nMauvages, December 9.\r\n\r\nA very regrettable incident occurred last night. The day being Sunday we\r\nwere due for a religious service at seven-fifteen. At seven-ten the\r\nReverend Gentleman, who was to instruct my flock in the way wherein they\r\nshould go, arrived in company with the Business Manager from\r\nGondrecourt. Now it happened that the Reverend Gentleman on this\r\noccasion was none other than my friend the Sentimental Secretary. He\r\nsurveyed the congregation; there were nine boys in the hut. He sat down\r\nand waited for the audience to arrive. But the audience didn’t. Instead\r\none wretch surreptitiously sneaked out the door. At last I felt it\r\nnecessary to come forward with apologies and explanations; my flock at\r\npresent was small to start with, the sheep had all gone to Domremy on an\r\nexcursion, the goats were deep in an after-payday poker game.\r\n\r\n“Do you wish me to hold the meeting?” the R. G. questioned grimly.\r\n\r\n“If you will.”\r\n\r\nThe Reverend Gentleman, a bit tight about the lips, laid on. It was a\r\ncold night; we gathered by the fire. I tried to make myself look as\r\nlarge as possible, but stretch the congregation as you might, we only\r\nreached two-thirds of the way around the stove.\r\n\r\n“Well,” said the Business Manager when it was all over with, “how soon\r\nwill you be ready to close out this hut?”\r\n\r\nI reminded him that after all it would have only taken ten righteous to\r\nsave Sodom, so might not eight save Mauvages?\r\n\r\nOf course just as soon as the Reverend Gentleman and the Business\r\nManager had shaken our dust off their feet and disappeared, a whole\r\ncrowd of boys came streaming into the hut. I accused them of having\r\nwaited just around the corner until they had seen the Religious Service\r\ndepart. As for Big Bill I consider him nothing short of a slacker, he\r\nsat in the kitchen all evening and wrote a letter to his girl. I tell\r\nhim that as hut detail it is obviously his duty to attend all services\r\nbut he explains that “it makes him homesick.”\r\n\r\nIn a town on the road between Mauvages and Gondrecourt there is a labor\r\ncamp of Chinese coolies. These are the laziest folk in Europe I am sure.\r\nThey are supposed to be working on the road, which needs it badly\r\nenough, resembling, as one boy declared, “the top of a stove when all\r\nthe lids are taken off.” All day long they squat by the roadside, or\r\nstand idle watching the traffic go by. “They’d rather be caught dead\r\nthan caught working,” as one boy said. The story goes that if one of\r\nthem dies the French Government must pay the Chinese Government thirty\r\nfrancs. They come dear at that. Moreover, they are unconscionable\r\nthieves. Up on the hill back of the town where they are billeted there\r\nis an American aviation field. The camp was abandoned after the\r\narmistice, but twelve boys from the air service were detailed to stay\r\nand guard the property. These boys find that the chief end of their life\r\nis to chase the Chinks out of the stores; they are quite persistent and\r\nperfectly unabashed. More than that, if the Chinks catch one of the\r\nguards by himself, they are likely to attack in force armed with sticks\r\nand as our boys are not allowed to carry weapons, such an attack is no\r\nlaughing matter. The trouble began, the boys tell me, in the days when\r\nthe camp was populated; two mechanics had once thought it a good joke to\r\ngive one of the Chinks a bath by ducking him in the horse-trough.\r\n\r\nOne of these heathen, I am told, came to church here at Mauvages\r\nyesterday and almost broke up the meeting. It pleased him to sing all\r\nthe way through the service, a wierd sing-song chant all his own, and as\r\nif that were not bad enough, in the middle of a prayer he had turned\r\nsquare about and started to play with the rosary of the scandalized\r\nMadame behind him! The most pious-minded could scarcely keep their\r\nthoughts on the priest’s dissertation. There was “_beaucoup\r\ndistraction_” as one Mademoiselle phrased it.\r\n\r\nThis morning I went down to Gondrecourt.\r\n\r\n“Well, and how are your eight men?” asked the Business Manager.\r\n\r\n“One of them has gone to the hospital with the mumps,” I answered. “So\r\nnow I have seven.”\r\n\r\n\r\nMauvages, December 12.\r\n\r\nI have been A. W. O. L. I have been on a joy ride. For the first time\r\nsince I came to France I have taken a real day off. I got a chance to go\r\nup to the old battle front on a “speeder.” I didn’t mention the matter\r\nto the office, but I took the chance. I knew I could safely trust the\r\nhut to the management of Bill and Nick for one day.\r\n\r\nWe started out shortly after six A. M., on the narrow-gauge bound for\r\nMont Sec. There were five of us on the speeder which is, you must know,\r\na little flat car something like a hand-car, only that instead of being\r\npropelled by hand power, it is run by a gasolene motor. Speeders are the\r\njolliest possible way of travelling and they can go like the wind: they\r\npossess just two disadvantages, their propensity for having engine\r\ntrouble, and the ease with which they jump the track at the slightest\r\nprovocation. It is told how in Abainville the other day a speeder jumped\r\nthe rails, the engineer, after turning a half a dozen somersaults,\r\npicked himself up, squared off, demanded; “Who in hell put the pebble on\r\nthe track?”\r\n\r\nFrom Mauvages we followed the A. and S. to Sorcy. There we switched onto\r\nthe line which the boys at Abainville used to declare “ran through the\r\ntrenches.” They would tell me wonderful tales of the trips they had\r\ntaken on this line; the smoke-stack of the engine protruded over the\r\ntop, they explained, and “Gosh, you could hear the bullets just\r\nsplatterin’ against it!”\r\n\r\nA short ways out from Sorcy we passed the last inhabited village. Ahead\r\nof us we could see the barren sinister outline of Mont Sec, that little\r\nGibraltar of the land which the Germans had captured and fortified early\r\nin the war, which the French had endeavored to retake in 1915 with the\r\nmost fearful losses, but which had remained impregnable, commanding,\r\nlooking down in contempt on our men in their muddy lowland trenches of\r\nthe Toul Sector, until, on September twelfth, the American Army had\r\ntaken it along with the rest of the Saint Mihiel salient.\r\n\r\nAs we neared Mont Sec we began to pass devastated villages, some of them\r\nmere formless ruins, others from a distance holding the shape and\r\noutline of habitable dwelling-places but on approach revealing\r\nthemselves as mere groups of riddled house-shells. Across the open\r\nplaces stretched interminable grey swathes of rusting tangled wire,\r\n“barbed-wire enough to fence Texas,” as one boy put it. On sidings we\r\npassed long lines of cars full of salvage, all the junk of war tossed\r\ncarelessly together. Along the tracks were scattered empty shells and\r\nhere and there piles of unexploded ammunition. In a shell-hole by the\r\nroadside, half filled with water, lay a hob-nailed shoe,—prosaic but\r\npitiful witness of some tragedy. It was the loneliest land, the most\r\nforsaken I have ever seen. Far and wide as one looked over the empty\r\nplain there was no living, moving creature anywhere.\r\n\r\nAt the foot of Mont Sec we stopped. There in the woods were the remains\r\nof a German camp; it had been a jolly little place fixed up like a beer\r\ngarden underneath the trees, with fancy “rustic” work and chairs and\r\ntables. We left the speeder there, and tramping across the fields,\r\nclimbed Mont Sec. Near the top we found the entrances to the dugouts.\r\nThe hill was tunneled through from side to side, all the corridors and\r\nrooms walled, roofed and floored with the heaviest oak lumber.\r\nEverywhere through the passage-ways ran a perfect network of electric\r\nwires. Long stairs led to the different levels. No furnishings were left\r\nexcept the bunks and some rough tables. We ate our luncheon of bread,\r\njam and corn willy in what had evidently been the officers’ quarters;\r\nthe room was nicely finished with cement, there was a fancy moulded\r\npattern in bas relief over the doorway, a pipe-hole showed where a stove\r\nhad been.\r\n\r\nAfter lunch we inspected the concrete machine-gun pill-boxes which\r\ndotted the hill-top. Then we went down the steep eastern slope to the\r\nvillage of Mont Sec. About the town, to judge from the ploughed and\r\npitted vineyards, the fighting must have been the fiercest. The village\r\nwas a village of the dead. We went inside the church; part of the tower,\r\nsome of the walls, a little of the roof was left, beyond that nothing.\r\nNear the door a French officer had scrawled “_Maudite soit le boche qui\r\ndétruit les églises_,”—cursed be the Hun who destroys the churches. In\r\nthis church, Madame the Caretaker tells me, the Germans commanded all\r\nthe male inhabitants of Mont Sec to assemble. Here they were kept\r\nprisoners for three days and nights. On the fourth day they were marched\r\noff at the bayonet’s point into Germany, and no one has ever heard a\r\nword from them since.\r\n\r\nJust outside the village in the little cemetery, ploughed with\r\nshell-holes, we found French, American and German graves. The German\r\ninscriptions all commemorated “heroes dead for the Fatherland;” one of\r\nthem vowed, with the help of God, vengeance on the enemy.\r\n\r\nWe went back to the speeder. As it was early in the afternoon we decided\r\nto go on. Rounding Mont Sec, we passed into German occupied territory.\r\nWe saw the famous cabbage patches which fed our soldiers after the Saint\r\nMihiel drive, and, on a hillock beside the road, one memorable scarecrow\r\ndressed from head to foot as a German soldier, “feldgrau” uniform,\r\ncartridge belt, helmet and all. At Hattonchatel we looked down on the\r\nGerman barracks from the hill-side but didn’t have time to stop. It was\r\ngrowing late, so we must turn about-face. Once headed for home our\r\ntroubles began. The rain which had been teasing us all day as a faint\r\ndrizzle, settled down to business. A few hundred yards down the\r\nhill-side the speeder jumped the track. Fortunately we weren’t running\r\nfast and the speeder jumped on the right side, if it had jumped on the\r\nleft we might have gone over the edge of the mountainous hill-side. As\r\nit was no real harm resulted beyond a violent bumping and shaking up; I\r\njumped and got a lame wrist. “The chances are, that whatever happens,\r\nshe won’t turn over,” the boys told me, “so hang on after this.” So I\r\nhung tight. The engine, which had worked like a charm all the way up,\r\nbegan to sulk and balk by fits. Presently it grew dark. We had one\r\nlantern, we lighted it and the boy who sat at the front end held it so\r\nthe light would fall on the rails. Every now and then the wind would\r\nblow it out. At each station along the track we would stop and ask the\r\nengineer operators whether the block ahead was clear. When we came to\r\nthe last station before the long forest stretches about Mont Sec the\r\noperator who came out to speak to us was quite angry; there were three\r\ntrains, he said, somewhere on the track ahead; we were doing a very\r\ndangerous thing, running after dark. We went on, straining our eyes as\r\nwe entered the woods in order to discern the dark mass on the track\r\nahead which would mean a train, for the trains, in memory of war days, I\r\nsuppose, carry absolutely no lights. A week ago a speeder ran head-on\r\ninto a train at night just above Sauvoy; of its three passengers, two\r\nwere killed, the other fearfully injured. We held ourselves tense, ready\r\nthe moment we had made out a train, and the speeder slowed down, to\r\njump, and, lifting the car, push it to one side off the tracks until the\r\ntrain had passed. Once we were lucky enough to make a siding just at the\r\ncritical moment. Sometimes we ran at the edge of high embankments,\r\nsometimes we would cross, on a trestle, a wide marshy stream; then the\r\nthought would come to me, _What if the speeder should jump here?_ And\r\nshe did jump twice more on the way back, but luckily both times in\r\nwell-selected places. The worst feature of these acrobatics was that the\r\njar had an unhealthy effect upon the engine and after each occasion the\r\nmechanics in the crowd had to delve and tinker before the speeder could\r\nbe coaxed to speed again. Also it was wet. The rain soaked through my\r\nraincoat, through my sweater, into my leather jacket; my skirt was a\r\ndripping rag, the water oozed from my gloves, raindrops dripped from my\r\nnose, my “waterproof” shoes were like sponges. You felt, as one of the\r\nboys put it, exactly like a figure in a fountain.\r\n\r\nBetween Mont Sec and Sorcy we got a tow. In the dark we came upon the\r\nrear end of a salvage train, tied ourselves up to it, and bumped merrily\r\nalong behind until the train turned off on a branch line and we had to\r\ncut loose and make our own way with the increasingly contrary engine.\r\nFortunately, from that point most of the way was down hill; on the\r\nup-grades we got off and walked; the last part of the way the boys\r\nsimply had to push the car. We reached home at half-past ten, tired,\r\nsoaked to the skin, but happy.\r\n\r\n\r\nMauvages, December 16.\r\n\r\nAfter this, Mauvages is going to be on the map! Mauvages is to be\r\nheadquarters for the —— Artillery Brigade, with seventeen hundred men in\r\ntown and thousands more in the villages about. Wonderful to say, this is\r\nthe very brigade to which my two batteries from the Artillery School\r\nbelong and though neither of these will be here in town, still they will\r\nbe near enough so I can get a glimpse of my old boys, I am sure.\r\n\r\nAlready we have an ammunition train and a crowd of “casuals” waiting\r\nhere for their outfits. The hut, which has of late been rather empty\r\nmornings, is now filled all day. These casuals are for the most part\r\nreplacements, shipped here directly from the ports, after a ten days’\r\nresidence in France. They have nothing to do at present but sit in the\r\nhut and think how miserable they are. It is funny to hear them talk.\r\nTheir opinion of Mauvages is inexpressible in polite terms. They are\r\nquite convinced that they have come to the Very Last Hole on Earth. In\r\nvain I assure them that Mauvages is quite a fine town, as French towns\r\ngo, in vain I draw their attention to its beauties and advantages. They\r\nare absolutely certain that nothing could be worse!\r\n\r\nMeanwhile I have been busy making frantic trips into Gondrecourt to\r\ndemand, in view of the coming crowds, a new hut, an electric lighting\r\nsystem, an addition to the old hut, anything or everything, except a man\r\nsecretary! But Gondrecourt takes the situation very calmly.\r\n\r\nJust to pass the time away, one of the new arrivals went fishing in the\r\ncanal yesterday. He bestowed his catch on me; it measured about six\r\ninches by one and a quarter. As it was still wriggling faintly I put the\r\npoor thing in the water-pail, only to find later that Big Bill in\r\ndisgust had thrown water and fish out into the back yard. Whereupon I\r\nraised such an outcry that Bill must go out in the dark and feel through\r\nthe wet grass for that fish until he found it. I carried it down to\r\ncamp, inviting the K. P.s to prepare it for the C. O.’s dinner. At\r\ndinner it appeared elegantly garnished with parsley in the center of a\r\nhuge platter. Just to pay me back they made me eat it, while the rest\r\ndined on steak.\r\n\r\n“How do you suppose he caught it?” asked the C. O. I said nothing.\r\nFishing with hand-grenades is strictly against the law.\r\n\r\n\r\nMauvages, December 18.\r\n\r\nMauvages is in disgrace. Mauvages is the black sheep in the Y. fold.\r\nMauvages is in wrong all the way around. And it’s all because of one Old\r\nGentleman and his ill-timed opinions.\r\n\r\nThe Old Gentleman came out to talk to us yesterday evening. We weren’t\r\nexpecting him. We were expecting a lecture on the Man Without a\r\nCountry,—whoever that may be, Jack Johnson or the Kaiser! as the boys\r\nsay,—by the Educational Department. But then we have almost given up\r\nexpecting to get what we expect. This is only the third time we have\r\nbeen fooled on the Man Without a Country who appears to be our Old Man\r\nof the Sea.\r\n\r\nThe Old Gentleman was brought out in state in the best Y. car by the Big\r\nChief, the Entertainment Department and a driver. The Entertainment\r\nDepartment immediately ensconced himself by the cook-stove with a Sunday\r\nPicture Supplement; the driver retired to a secluded corner to play a\r\ngame of checkers with one of the boys; while the Big Chief took his\r\nstand out front. I for once back-slid scandalously, and, instead of\r\noccupying a front seat with a deeply interested expression spread upon\r\nmy countenance, sat in the kitchen and ate jam and waffles, the waffles\r\nwhich were heart-shaped and crisp and heavenly, having been brought by\r\nNick from his latest supper party.\r\n\r\nThe Old Gentleman stood out by the stove, the stage proving too chilly.\r\nThere was a crowd in the hut. He put his foot in it at the start. He\r\nannounced himself as an intimate friend of ex-President Roosevelt. The\r\nboys, sniffing politics, grew suspicious, even hostile. He began on the\r\nscandal of America’s unpreparedness, from that passed by degrees to the\r\nview that Germany was not yet defeated and as a climax called upon the\r\nboys to rise and put themselves on record as being willing to stay in\r\nFrance until Kingdom come, if necessary, in order to do the job up\r\nbrown. The boys did not rise. Instead they heckled the Old Gentleman\r\nuntil he grew as red as a turkey-cock and so indignant as to fairly wax\r\nspeechless. One of the ammunition train boys, a husky lad who, they tell\r\nme, is an old guard house standby, led the opposition. Out in the\r\nkitchen you could have heard a pin drop. The Entertainment Department\r\nand I sat and stared at each other.\r\n\r\nThe whole trouble as I saw it, was that the Old Gentleman had slipped up\r\non his dates. He was giving them a Before-November-Eleventh speech when\r\nit was after the eleventh. It was as if he had quite failed to\r\ncomprehend that at eleven o’clock on that date the whole psychological\r\noutlook of the American doughboy underwent an instantaneous change. His\r\nentire mental horizon became forthwith concentrated to one burning\r\npoint,—the desire which he expresses simply but adequately in the words;\r\n“I want to go home!” And not ex-President Roosevelt, nor President\r\nWilson, nor General Pershing, nor anybody else could make him interested\r\nin anything that was not remotely, at least, related to that issue.\r\n\r\nAt last the agony was over. The Old Gentleman came back to the kitchen\r\nmopping his brow. When he had finished expressing his opinion of\r\nMauvages, the driver went out to crank the car. The car was gone. Of\r\ncourse then, everyone remembered having heard a car drive off in the\r\nmiddle of the lecture,—every one that is, but I, I had been too\r\ninterested in the waffles,—but of course no one had really thought that\r\nit could be, etc. A search party was recruited which scoured highway and\r\nbyway. The M. P.s at Gondrecourt were notified by ’phone. Meanwhile it\r\nwas ten o’clock, a bleak night and four indignant gentlemen were\r\nstranded six miles from home. An ambassador was elected to go and lay\r\nthe case before the A. R. C. O. The C. O. on his way to bed, instructed\r\nthe emissary where billets for the night might possibly be had. But the\r\nOld Gentleman, upon receiving the information, flatly and finally\r\nrefused to stay in any billet in town; he would sleep in his own bed or\r\nno other. After a nervous interval the ambassador again approached the\r\nC. O., this time suggesting the loan of his car and chauffeur. The C.\r\nO., aroused a second time from bed, acceeded shortly, the ambassador\r\nreturned to despatch the unfortunate Bill to camp to break the news to\r\nthe chauffeur. The chauffeur, who was in the midst of an after-hours\r\npoker game, when he recovered from his astonishment, replied\r\n(expurgated) that he’d come when he got good and ready, and settled back\r\nto his game.\r\n\r\nIn the meantime my four guests by the kitchen-stove discussed in part\r\nthe peculiarities of the Japanese language, but chiefly the shortcomings\r\nof Mauvages. The Chief, however, showed himself a gentleman. He washed\r\nthe dishes up! And considering that he was a man and a minister and that\r\nthe light was dim and the water cold, he washed them pretty well.\r\n\r\nAt a quarter to eleven the A. R. chauffeur having presumably forced all\r\nthe others into bankruptcy, or gone bankrupt himself, drove up to the\r\ndoor and I said farewell to my friends.\r\n\r\nThis morning a rescue expedition was sent out from Gondrecourt. It\r\nfinally discovered the lost car, none the worse for its joy-ride, in a\r\nditch half-way to Sauvoy. Information has reached me on the side that it\r\nwas a little group of “hard-boiled guys” from the ammunition train who\r\nstole the auto. They were displeased with the Old Gentleman’s opinions,\r\nand they made up their minds that he should walk home.\r\n\r\nSo this is how matters stand: I and my hut are in discredit at\r\nHeadquarters, because my boys stole their car. The Old Gentleman has\r\nopenly declared that Mauvages is the most unpatriotic spot in France.\r\nThe A. R. C. O. is disgusted because he was routed twice out of bed in\r\none night. The chauffeur is so incensed at me and mine at having to\r\ndrive into town at eleven P. M. that he persistently forgets to stop for\r\nmy daily papers. And the boys are all sore and touchy on account of the\r\nopinions expressed by the Old Gentleman in and after his lecture. Such\r\nis the happy lot of a hut secretary.\r\n\r\n\r\nMauvages, December 23.\r\n\r\nThe Big Push is here. Our lawn has turned into a gun park with limbers\r\nand caissons elbowing each other under our very eaves. All day the\r\nlittle hut is crowded to its capacity and at night it becomes so full\r\nthat I am literally afraid it will burst out at the seams. Colonels and\r\ncaptains are forever bobbing up like so many Jack-in-the-Boxes in my\r\nkitchen which I was used to consider as a refuge and a sanctum. They\r\nhave the best intentions in the world; they offer me advice on every\r\nsubject under the sun from the building of new shelves in the canteen to\r\nthe frequency with which I should require Big Bill to shave. And quite\r\nunsolicited they have given me a detail,—a detail of such proportions\r\nthat I am swamped. I don’t know how many there are. They never stand\r\nstill long enough for me to count them. Sometimes there appear to be ten\r\nand sometimes twenty. Like the Old Woman who lived in the shoe, I have\r\nso many details I don’t know what to do. They are the nicest boys that\r\never were, if only they didn’t take up quite so much room! Now when I am\r\nminded to sit down for a moment to think, my only course is to go into\r\nthe store-room and sit on a packing-box, and the store-room is very\r\ncold. And the worst of it is that they all, from colonel to K. P., have\r\nthe beautiful idea in their heads that I am not to do any work, but just\r\nto be a sort of parlor ornament, and a sweet influence; that I will, in\r\nshort, like the old man who was afraid of the cow, “sit on the stile and\r\ncontinue to smile,” while the army runs my hut. Which is not at all my\r\nnotion of things.\r\n\r\nIn the meantime we have been busy making such preparations for Christmas\r\nas we could. Chiefly we have decorated the hut. I begged two boxes full\r\nof lanterns, flags, tinsel and festoons, from the office, then I merely\r\nmentioned the fact that I wanted a tree and lots of branches to trim\r\nwith and the boys did the rest. I don’t know where those greens came\r\nfrom, I don’t want to know. But there is one spectre that keeps haunting\r\nme; the apparition of an indignant Frenchman at my canteen door, with a\r\nbill half a metre long for damages.\r\n\r\nThis new outfit has brought a heathen custom to town with them. The band\r\nplays for Reveille! We had been so peaceful, so unmilitary here in town\r\nwith not so much as a bugle note to make a ripple in our slumbers! But\r\nnow at some unimagined hour before daylight a brazen clangour bursts\r\nsuddenly forth. Down the street and past under my window in the dark\r\nthey go, making the grand tour of the three streets in town, thumping\r\nand tooting as if their lives depended on it. I never knew a band could\r\nmake such an amazing racket, nor could sound quite so joyously impudent.\r\nA bucketful of cold water couldn’t dispel sleep any more effectively. I\r\nfeel like jumping out of bed. But I don’t, for it is pitch dark and cold\r\nand very damp. There is a fireplace to be sure in my room but after one\r\nor two fruitless attempts at making it produce a little heat I abandoned\r\nthe idea and decided to spend all my time between my bed and the\r\ncanteen. But when I desire to view my countenance in the mirror, I have\r\nto take a towel and wipe off the moisture that collects on it to trickle\r\ndown in little streams.\r\n\r\nI have received my first Christmas present. Bill and Nick—the\r\ndears!—have presented me a beautiful silk umbrella. I think they did it\r\nlargely for the honor of the family. As long as my old faithful only had\r\nits handle gone, they could overlook it, but when the ribs took to\r\nparting company with the covering, they evidently thought that something\r\nshould be done about it. Nick went to Gondrecourt to buy it; coming\r\nback, he managed to fall off the truck, was picked up and given first\r\naid by a kindly Frenchwoman, and reached home in slightly damaged shape\r\nbut with the precious umbrella safe. I have been suggesting to Bill that\r\nhe set a two franc piece in the handle and then I will have his and\r\nNick’s initials carved on it, but he doesn’t wax enthusiastic.\r\n\r\n\r\nMauvages, December 25.\r\n\r\nWe sat up half the night packing Christmas boxes,—seventeen hundred of\r\nthem, one for every man in Mauvages. Two packages of cigarettes, a\r\ncigar, two bars of chocolate and a can of “smoking” went into each\r\nlittle cardboard box labelled in red “A Merry Xmas from the folks at\r\nhome through the Y;” that is, theoretically they went in, practically it\r\nwas discovered that no human ingenuity could so arrange the pesky things\r\nas to make them fit the box. So finally we decided to treat the\r\n“smoking” as a separate affair. I wanted badly to have Santa Claus hand\r\nthe boxes to the boys underneath the Christmas tree, but the boys\r\nfinally convinced me that the difficulties, including the danger of\r\n“repeaters” ad lib, were too great, so we fitted the boxes into\r\npacking-cases and shipped a case to each company and let each of the top\r\nsergeants play that he was Santa Claus.\r\n\r\nIt was half past twelve by the time I passed the church on my way back\r\nto the billet. They were celebrating midnight mass. The light of the\r\naltar-candles illumined the old windows with a soft radiance. They were\r\nY. M. C. A. candles. Monsieur le Curé had begged them from me in the\r\nafternoon; he could get no others, he said, and was in great distress.\r\n\r\n_Chez nous_ there was much activity. I stopped inside the door to chat\r\nwith the cooks. They were up plucking the Colonel’s goose and expected\r\nto make a night of it.\r\n\r\nSounds of gaiety were ringing from the dining-room. A young lieutenant,\r\nslightly touseled, thrust his head out of the door. I wished him a Merry\r\nChristmas; in return he asked me in to partake of an anchovy sandwich. I\r\ntook one look inside the door at the array of empty bottles, declined\r\nwith thanks, and climbed the stairs to bed. For a long while afterwards\r\nsomeone downstairs kept mewing like a cat. It might have been the\r\nslightly touseled lieutenant.\r\n\r\nToday it has been raw and damp and chill and grey and drizzly. I had a\r\nnotion that I might ask the French kiddies in this afternoon to see the\r\ntree and receive some little gifts of cookies and chocolate but when I\r\nreached the hut this morning and saw how packed it was I quickly gave up\r\nthe project. Not for all the children in ten villages would I turn the\r\nboys out into the rain.\r\n\r\nTonight there is to be some sort of show, arranged by the entertainment\r\nofficer.\r\n\r\nJust before dinner time the Second Lieutenant from the A. R. came in,\r\nlooking full of mysterious importance. “The C. O. leaves this noon,” he\r\nsaid. “He’s ordered to report at Souilly by twelve tonight. I’ll tell\r\nyou all about it later.” Later I learned. Inspectors had been visiting\r\nthe dump. They had found it in a very dangerous state indeed. The wet\r\nweather has affected the explosives so that should the sun come out for\r\na day or two the chemical change ensuing would in all probability cause\r\nan explosion which would set off the whole dump with its millions of\r\ndollars worth of high explosives. In which case little Mauvages would of\r\ncourse go higher than Halifax. The C. O. has been removed and the Second\r\nLieutenant left in charge. The work of destroying the dangerous\r\nexplosives is to be pursued at top speed. In the meanwhile we will pray\r\nfor continued rain.\r\n\r\nI received two gifts today that touched me deeply. One was a pretty pink\r\nembroidered scarf from the boys at the aviation field. The lad who\r\nbrought it to me had walked twelve miles, into Gondrecourt and back\r\nagain in the sleety rain, to buy it! The other was a package labeled;\r\n“Wishing you a Mary Xmas from the Operators at A. S. No. 9, and may the\r\nnext one be in the States.” Inside were two boxes of chocolates, their\r\nChristmas candy issue!\r\n\r\nAs for me, I am ashamed—I have been so busy and so bothered that I just\r\ncouldn’t seem to manage a gift for anyone, not for Bill nor Nick nor\r\neven Monsieur le Curé.\r\n\r\n\r\nMauvages, December 28.\r\n\r\nNeddy has come back! His battery has just arrived at Rosières and last\r\nnight he got off and walked over here to see me.\r\n\r\nWe sat and talked by the kitchen-stove and I found him just the same\r\nshy, slow-spoken dreamy lad. The long months at the front have seemingly\r\ninstilled nothing bitter in him, nor left any scars on his spirit, no\r\nmatter if he is wearing a wonderful belt quite covered with German\r\nbuttons all “cut off of dead ones.” He dug out of his pockets for me two\r\nodd little picture frames made cleverly out of rings from German fuses,\r\nwith pieces of celluloid cut from the eye-holes of German gas-masks for\r\nglass, and held together with surgeon’s plaster. Then of course there\r\nwere the latest pictures of his girl to show me.\r\n\r\nHe told me about the battery. On the whole their casualties have been\r\nlight. Jones was gassed, and is in hospital somewhere; it seems just\r\nlike Jones, somehow, to get gassed! The boys, he told me, had been\r\nfairly homesick for the little old Artillery School Hut,—most of all, he\r\nsaid, they had missed my hot chocolate.\r\n\r\nThen just to make the occasion perfect, who should walk in but Snow!\r\nSnow’s battery is at Delouze, two towns away; but Snow has been on leave\r\ndown on the Riviera, having the time of his young life.\r\n\r\n“I never could see what there was in this country worth fighting for,”\r\nhe told me, “until I went down there. But now I know.”\r\n\r\nHe had just returned from his furlough this very afternoon. He hadn’t a\r\nthing to eat all day, being of course, “dead broke.” I got the best\r\nimpromptu supper I could and we all three sat in the kitchen and ate it.\r\nThe menu was: crackers and canned milk; sardines and crackers;\r\ncracker-pudding and cocoa; crackers and jam. The boys gossiped and\r\nswapped yarns like two old veterans. Neddy related how the gunners at\r\nthe front when loading would pat and even kiss a shell as they adjured\r\nit not to be a dud! Snow told me how ——, the talented, the brilliant,\r\nhad gone to pieces at the front and had been sent back to the S. O. S.\r\nThis must have been hard on Snow for the two were close friends. “I said\r\nto him one day,” recounted Snow, “——, you must have done something\r\nawfully wicked in your life to make you so afraid to die.” Undoubtedly\r\nthe poor fellow’s failure was due, not so much to lack of courage, as to\r\nover-sensitiveness and too much imagination. The pity of it is that this\r\nwill surely prove a bad blow to his self-respect.\r\n\r\nWhen it was time for Neddy to go I saw there was something he wanted to\r\nsay to me. At last it came out. Around his neck, it seems, he is still\r\nwearing the chain with the little cross which I gave him when he went to\r\nthe front. And he has the unshakable notion in his quaint head that it\r\nwas the cross which kept him safe!\r\n\r\n\r\nMauvages, December 29.\r\n\r\nTonight we gave a party: hot chocolate and cookies for the whole camp.\r\nEvery Sunday before the Big Push came I had been serving hot chocolate\r\nfree but I had been staggered by the thought of trying to make chocolate\r\nfor seventeen hundred men on my little stove that is just big enough to\r\nsit on, over a fire which has to be coaxed with German powder sticks and\r\ncandle ends before it will burn, and serving it in our sixty odd cocoa\r\nbowls. This morning, however, I had an inspiration. I consulted the\r\ndetail, they approved. Accordingly we sent requests to three of the\r\nbattery mess-kitchens, asking that they should each furnish us, at\r\nfive-thirty, the largest container they possessed full of hot water.\r\nThen we asked the mess sergeants to announce the party at supper and\r\ntell the boys to bring their mess-cups. The sentry at the street corner\r\nwas also instructed to let no one pass without his mess-cup. Then we\r\nstarted in, heating all the water we could manage, making chocolate\r\npaste, opening whole cases full of canned milk.\r\n\r\nAt six o’clock the fun, per schedule, began. The boys lined up from the\r\ncounter to the stage. But instead of a single line, it soon became\r\nevident we had two, one coming and one going, which together formed an\r\nendless chain like a giant wheel which kept slowly but surely revolving.\r\nAfter the second or third time around a boy would begin to acquire a\r\nslightly sheepish look and endeavor to avoid my eye, but when they found\r\nthat all they got was a grin and “I’m glad you like it!” they grinned\r\nback unashamed.\r\n\r\n“I can’t stop,” joyfully explained one lad to me, “I’m in the line and I\r\ncan’t get out; I just gotter keep on coming round.”\r\n\r\n“Oh boy! but that’s the best thing I’ve had in France!” declared\r\nanother.\r\n\r\nWhile a third announced; “Gee, but I’m full all the way up! If I drink\r\nanother drop I sure will bust”—a confession which may have contained\r\nmore fact than fancy, for some of the boys did drink so much that they\r\ngot sick right then and there. It was an orgy. And when the last of the\r\nfour huge containers had been drained to a drop, why everyone, I\r\nbelieve, for once had had enough.\r\n\r\n“You’ve got all the business in town right here tonight,” one of the\r\nboys informed me. “I just took a look in at the cafés. Every one of them\r\nis empty.”\r\n\r\nPersonally I feel that the party was a Great Success. We shall have to\r\nhave one just like it every Sunday.\r\n\r\n\r\nMauvages, January 1, 1919.\r\n\r\n_Mes meilleurs voeux de Bonne Année!_ or, as the boys say; “Bun Annie!”\r\nWe welcomed the new Year in _con molto giubilo_. Downstairs at my billet\r\nthere was music until late and after that sounds as of a repetition of\r\nthe Christmas party. At twelve o’clock by the old church bell, the band,\r\nwhich I had imagined long since safe and sound in bed, burst forth into\r\nmusic and straggled down the street playing “_There’ll be a hot time in\r\nthe old town tonight_,” and all the rest of the most rakish airs in its\r\nrepertoire. I stepped out on my Juliet balcony. The boys were setting\r\noff pyrotechnics of all sorts “salvaged” from the dump; flares, colored\r\nlights, and rockets. The street burned out of the darkness in\r\nrose-colored mist against which showed black silhouettes of soldiers who\r\nwaved their arms and shouted and sang; while from the edge of the\r\nvillage sounded a sharp tattoo of rifle shots. Just as the light was\r\nbeginning to fade out I heard an emphatic bang of the front door below\r\nme and looking down saw two figures; a little brisk bustling one and a\r\ntall, lean one go hurrying down the path and out the gate. It was our\r\nColonel and an attendant officer. Retribution, I knew, was bearing down\r\nupon the revellers. Sure enough, this morning I learned that the\r\nColonel, sallying forth, had struck right and left, leaving a trail of\r\narrests all over town.\r\n\r\nBut even with the Colonel’s sortie, quiet did not descend on Mauvages\r\nfor some time. The party below-stairs was not confined to the mess-hall\r\nthis time but was also being celebrated in the kitchen. At about one\r\no’clock a K. P. stumbled up the stairs and knocked on the door of the\r\nCuré’s chamber just across from me. He had some champagne for the Curé,\r\nhe explained in thick and execrable French. The Curé must drink it in\r\nhonor of the New Year. It was good champagne. I could hear the Curé\r\nreplying from his bed in rapid deprecating sentences, but the K. P. held\r\nto his point; he had set his heart on the old man’s joining the\r\ncelebration. “_Champagne bun_,” he kept repeating, “_Vous camarade. Bun\r\nannie._” For a long time they carried on the argument, but finally, as\r\nthe priest implacably refused to open his door, the genial K. P. gave up\r\nin disgust, confiding to his friends as he reached the floor that the\r\nCuré was, after all, nothing but a dried up old fish.\r\n\r\nThis morning I went down to Headquarters to turn in my accounts. Alas,\r\nfor the vanity of human intentions! At Christmas I had sent little boxes\r\nof fudge to several of the men at the office, hoping thereby to curry\r\nfavour for my canteen and counteract any bad impressions which our\r\ndelinquencies in the matter of attending Sunday Services and\r\nappropriating other people’s autos might have caused. Now I find I have\r\nmade more enemies among the ones that I left out, than I made friends of\r\nthe ones I favoured.\r\n\r\nIn spite of this sad condition of affairs I managed to tease one driver\r\ninto agreeing to take me to Vaucouleurs. At Vaucouleurs I had been told\r\nthat there was a commissary where one could purchase candles, and the\r\nboys are desperately anxious for candles. At first I did not quite\r\nunderstand so burning a desire as they exhibited, but now I am wise.\r\nThey want them—poor wretches!—so they can “read their shirts,” before\r\nthey go to bed! I stayed down in Gondrecourt, missing dinner, and then\r\nset out for Vaucouleurs with my heart full of hope and my pockets\r\ncrammed with currency. It was a long, cold trip in the driving, drizzly\r\nrain. Arrived at Vaucouleurs we found that, being the first of the\r\nmonth, the commissary was closed for inventory.\r\n\r\n\r\nMauvages, January 3.\r\n\r\nEverybody has a little pet trouble of his own these days. The A. R. has\r\nits share and more of them. Lieutenant C. recounted some of his tonight.\r\nHe had been carrying the dangerous explosives over beyond the woods to\r\nthe west of the town where they were being blown off. Then the French\r\nTown Major had called.\r\n\r\nIt wouldn’t do, he said, to blow off the ammunition there any more;\r\nthere were sick people in the town and the explosions fairly made them\r\njump right up out of their beds. And really one couldn’t blame them. So\r\nthen the Lieutenant had switched to the north, over beyond the\r\nnarrow-gauge, only to be promptly visited by a furious delegation of\r\nengineers. Whether it was because proper precautions hadn’t been taken\r\nor what I don’t know, whatever the case, in the course of the explosions\r\na large rock had made a gaping hole in the roof of A. S. No. 9 and\r\nnarrowly missed one of my good friends the operators. The complaint of\r\nthe engineers was shortly followed by an indignant ultimatum from the\r\nCaptain at Abainville who is in charge of the railway. Unless the\r\nexplosions were forthwith stopped, he threatened, no more trains would\r\nbe run on the road. On top of all this the Colonel of artillery must\r\ncall the Lieutenant to account. The boys whom he arrested New Year’s\r\nnight had been shooting off their rifles. The shells must have come from\r\nthe dump. Since it was Lieutenant C.’s dump, it was his business to keep\r\nhis shells in their proper places. Therefore Lieutenant C. was\r\nresponsible for the shooting.\r\n\r\nI don’t know just how the matter has been arranged with the Captain at\r\nAbainville, but the explosions beyond the tracks have been going on all\r\nday. Latest reports testify that that roof of A. S. No. 9 is riddled\r\nlike a sieve with stone-holes and that the cook, who never was known to\r\nbe a religious man, spends all his time beneath the table praying.\r\n\r\nTwo of the ordnance boys have been badly burned while setting off the\r\nexplosions, and the whole detachment is sore and disheartened because\r\nthey are being worked so hard in the mud and rain and their Sunday\r\nholiday denied them. Special details from the artillery are being sent\r\nto work at the dump every day in order to hasten the work of\r\ndestruction, but these boys, too, are sullen and rebellious. They have\r\nbeen used to handling shells at the front, they say, and they consider\r\nit an indignity to have to handle them here in the dump as if they,\r\nforsooth, belonged to the ordnance! And so the work goes none too\r\nquickly. Everyone has been instructed to keep a particular lookout for\r\nGerman delay fuses, those deadly little infernal machines, which can be\r\nset, according to the strength of the acid which eats through the\r\nspring, to explode any time between a week and six months. They are\r\ndisguised cleverly to look exactly like ordinary percussion fuses, the\r\nonly betraying mark being a tiny six pointed star on the nose. Several\r\nhave already been found planted in dumps which contained captured German\r\nammunition, and the tale runs through camp that some have been\r\ndiscovered here, although this I rather suspect is just another army\r\nrumor.\r\n\r\nTonight one of the ordnance boys hobbled into the hut, his left foot\r\nswathed in bandages; a shell had fallen on a toe and crushed it. I\r\nattempted to sympathize.\r\n\r\n“Don’t waste any of your sympathy on me,” he retorted, “I’m the luckiest\r\nfeller you know. There ain’t a man in camp who don’t envy me.”\r\n\r\nAs for me, I am having a few pet troubles too. One of these is concerned\r\nwith the army dentist at Gondrecourt. And this is all in consequence of\r\nthe kind operators at A. S. No. 9 and their Christmas chocolates, for\r\namong those chocolates was a caramel and,—well that candy was made in\r\nSwitzerland and so was probably pro-German anyway.\r\n\r\nYesterday I had to witness the harrowing spectacle of a stalwart\r\ndoughboy being separated from a tooth. When the ghastly business was\r\nover he shook himself.\r\n\r\n“I’ve been over the top,” he declared, “and got filled up with\r\nmachine-gun bullets,”—he was wearing two wound stripes,—“but I’ll tell\r\nthe world them bullets weren’t nothin’ to that tooth!”\r\n\r\nBut the chief of my troubles is the hut lighting problem. So far, I have\r\nnot been able to get any response to my petition for an electric\r\nlighting system. Our fine carbide lamps are a frank fizzle, our candles\r\nare all gone, we have nothing but a few lanterns and small oil lamps.\r\nEvery day someone breaks my heart by breaking another lamp chimney, and\r\nnew ones, alas! are not to be had for love or money in this part of\r\nFrance. Moreover the boys have developed a most inconvenient habit of\r\nwalking off with the lamps. At first I said in exasperation; “Well, let\r\nthem take them! As soon as the oil burns out they’ll find the lamps\r\naren’t any use to them.” But I didn’t reckon on their Yankee ingenuity.\r\nThey are smart enough, it seems, to bring back the empty ones, and\r\nexchange them for filled ones, every evening!\r\n\r\n\r\nMauvages, January 5.\r\n\r\nMauvages is in a state of mind for mutiny, and it’s all over a little\r\npiece of cloth about two inches square. The case is this; the ——\r\nArtillery Brigade, having served six months continuously at the front,\r\nhaving participated in all the big offensives, and having won an\r\nenviable reputation, was attached, on coming to this area, for the sake\r\nof military convenience, to the —— Division already stationed here, a\r\ndraft organization which had never been to the front at all. The\r\nartillery were far from pleased over the arrangement, but they managed\r\nto swallow their pride and put a good face on the matter. A few days\r\nago, however, the order came out that they were to abandon the insignia\r\nof their old division and appear—every last man of them,—with the\r\ninsignia of the new division on his arm. The men were furious. The\r\nbatteries stationed at Rosières made a bonfire and burned the detestable\r\ninsignia publicly, for which they got two weeks restriction to camp and\r\na new set of little red patches. One boy sewed his “clover-leaf,” as\r\nthey call them, to the seat of his breeches. Raincoats have become all\r\nthe wear, even in the best of weather, for under these the hated symbol\r\nis hidden. Indeed the feeling was so intense that in some places both\r\nofficers and men tore off their service-stripes before putting on the\r\nnew insignia.\r\n\r\nI alone in the town am wearing the insignia of the old division and this\r\nis a wonderful and weird affair cut out of turkey red bunting and pinned\r\nto my sweater sleeve in a moment of reminiscent loyalty by my indignant\r\ndetail. But the band keeps on lustily proclaiming the brigade’s undying\r\nallegiance, for every morning for Reveille, as it makes the grand tour\r\nof the town it brays forth defiantly the war march of the old division.\r\n\r\n“We haven’t got orders to stop _that!_” says the leader.\r\n\r\nSince the spirit of rebellion is abroad I have been managing a little\r\nmutiny of my own. It came about in the matter of Sunday movies. Up till\r\nthe present we had been accustomed to having a service every Sunday\r\nnight, but since the artillery moved in we have been furnished with a\r\nfull-fledged morning service by the regimental chaplain, in view of\r\nwhich I had set my heart on having movies in the evening rather than a\r\nsecond service. I based my position on the grounds that, since to my\r\nnotion at least, the main end of the work over here is simply to keep\r\nthe boys away from the things that would hurt them, on Sunday night, the\r\nmost dangerous night of all the week, this could best be done by drawing\r\nthem to the hut with a movie show; always provided that their “religious\r\nneeds” had been supplied earlier in the day.\r\n\r\nThe movie machine was at the hut, I had found an operator in one of the\r\nbatteries, a little Jewish boy who bragged of long experience in the\r\nstates; all I wanted was a film. I went with my request to the office.\r\nMy logic it seemed to me was unassailable. But the office couldn’t see\r\nit that way. After much debate we agreed to disagree in theory. In\r\npractice I carried off my film. But I did it with a sinking of the\r\nheart. My relations with the office have always been quite cordial, this\r\nwas the first incident to cast a gloom over them. Anyway, I thought,\r\nwe’re going to have those movies! I advertised the show extensively.\r\n\r\nSunday night came. The hut was thronged. I was feeling rather\r\nparticularly pleased with things. We had ministered to the boys’ souls\r\nin the morning, fortified the inner man with free hot chocolate at six\r\no’clock, now we were going to finish out the day by satisfying their\r\nromantic cravings with a film drama of love and adventure.\r\n\r\nBut oh! for the pride that goes before the stumbling-block! When it came\r\nto the test it seemed that the little operator, for all his bragging,\r\ncouldn’t make the movie machine go. Perhaps it was because the lad\r\ndidn’t understand the foreign make, perhaps it was because the machine\r\nneeded to be talked to in French, or perhaps it was just because the\r\nproject had been unblessed from the beginning; I don’t know. We had half\r\nthe camp ganged around the machine, offering to take a hand. Everybody\r\nwas criticizing and advising, which, I suppose, added the last touch to\r\nthe little operator’s confusion. After waiting an interminable time in\r\nthe dark we witnessed a few feeble flickers on the screen and then\r\ndarkness once more. The audience dribbled disgustedly away. They\r\nprobably made up for their disappointment in the cafés.\r\n\r\nThis morning the driver stopped at the hut to take the machine away.\r\n“Have a good show, last night?” he asked.\r\n\r\n“Umm hm,” said I, grinning cheerfully.\r\n\r\nI am praying that the truth about that show never reaches the office!\r\n\r\n\r\nMauvages, January 10.\r\n\r\nTonight I leave Mauvages. Two weeks more and I shall be “homeward\r\nbound.” I am so tired that it has seemed to me for some time that the\r\nonly thing I can do is to go home. There isn’t any room in France these\r\ndays for anyone who isn’t perfectly strong, perfectly rested. A week ago\r\nI went to Nancy and persuaded the lady in charge of the women workers of\r\nthis division, after some argument, to let me go. I have already\r\noverstayed my contract by eight months. Now they have telegraphed from\r\nParis that they have a sailing for me. The man secretary is here to take\r\nover this hut.\r\n\r\nBecause I hate leave-takings I tried to keep the fact that I was going\r\ndark until the very last minute but at the end word got around. The boys\r\ncame flocking into my kitchen with messages and missives for the states.\r\nBoys whom I had never to my knowledge seen before pledged me to call up\r\ntheir wives on the long distance telephone as soon as I should land. One\r\nboy gave me two German fuses weighing a number of pounds apiece to carry\r\nhome. If I would take one for him, I might keep the other one, he said.\r\n\r\n“Say hello to the Statue of Liberty for me!”\r\n\r\n“Give my regards to Broadway.”\r\n\r\n“Say Lady, can’t you take me in your trunk?” they chorused.\r\n\r\nAs for Nick, he has instructed me to go to Brooklyn, pick out the best\r\nhat in his wife’s millinery store, “And tell the missus it’s on me.”\r\n\r\nI have taken my last agonized inventory, turned in my last\r\naccounts,—balanced by Big Bill. This afternoon I went to take my last\r\nlook at the little hut. It is all torn to pieces, they have begun to\r\nbuild that addition which I started begging for a month ago; I slipped\r\none of my canteen tea-cups into my bag just for old times sake.\r\n\r\nNeddy came in to say Good-bye. At the last moment he shyly placed a\r\nlittle box in my hand. In it was a pretty gilt Lorraine cross. He had\r\nwalked all the way into Gondrecourt to get it. He would have bought me a\r\nchain too, he explained with a flush, only he was “pecuniarily\r\nembarrassed.” Dear little Neddy! If he only knew how much better I liked\r\nit without the chain.\r\n\r\nMy luggage is all packed and Bill has strapped it up for me. I have said\r\nadieu to the Curé and the Colonel. Madame the Caretaker has kissed me on\r\nboth cheeks and dropped a tear over me. Now I am waiting for the A. R.\r\njitney to come and take me to the station.\r\n\r\nA horrid thought has just occurred to me. The captain’s cognac must be\r\nstill in the corner of the store-room shelf. What _will_ the secretary\r\nthink?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VII: VERDUN—THE FRENCH\r\n\r\n\r\nParis, January 12.\r\n\r\nIt is fortunate that the world looks tolerantly on a certain instability\r\nin the feminine mind. When I left Mauvages there was just one thought in\r\nmy head,—to go straight home. I have been twenty-four hours in Paris;\r\nalready my resolution is wavering. It’s all on account of what they said\r\nto me at the Headquarters office.\r\n\r\nParis is truly a different city from the one I last saw in September on\r\nmy way back from Saint Malo; the streets thronged with people, and\r\nbrightly lighted at night, the shop windows gay and inviting, freed from\r\ntheir patterned lattices of paper strips which formerly protected the\r\nglass from the concussions caused by shells and bombs. In the Place de\r\nla Concorde the statue representing the City of Strasbourg, divested of\r\nthe mourning wreaths which it has worn ever since 1870, now smiles\r\ntriumphantly above a mass of flags and flowers; and, most thrilling of\r\nall, the crouched grey guns of Germany, like so many dumb impotent\r\nmonsters, throng the Place de la Concorde, stretch in a double line\r\nalong the Champs Elysées all the way to the Arc de Triomphe.\r\n\r\nEverywhere the shop windows display a picture; a woman’s form, heroic,\r\nbearing a great sword, with wide spread wings which are at the same time\r\nwings and American flags; before her the bent and cowering form of the\r\nEmperor; while beyond, a sea of khaki, illimitable hosts of warriors\r\nmelting away in waves against the horizon; and underneath the words:\r\n\r\n“But what tremendous fleet could have brought hither such an army?”\r\n\r\n“The _Lusitania_.”\r\n\r\nThe Patisserie shops are full of enticing little cakes once more; but,\r\nsad to say, the quality one finds has depreciated while the prices have\r\ngone sky-rocketing. I thought I would economise this noon and, instead\r\nof eating a five franc luncheon at the hotel, substitute a cup of cocoa\r\nand some little cakes at a tea-shop. When I came to pay my bill it was\r\nseven francs fifty! While I was partaking of my frugal repast a French\r\nRed Cross nurse came into the shop leading two blind poilus. She bought\r\nthem each some cakes as if they had been two little boys and they stood\r\nthere eating them. The poilu nearest me, a tall fine-looking fellow,\r\ntasted his, “_Ah!_” he exclaimed, “_c’est une vrai Madeleine!_” He lied.\r\nIt was no more like a pre-war Madeleine than chalk is like cheese, but\r\nif it had been made of India-rubber I suppose he would have said the\r\nsame thing, and said it with just the same grave and gracious courtesy.\r\n\r\nNow that the war is over, one feels sorrier than ever for the French\r\nofficers who haven’t medals.\r\n\r\n“The Frenchies are issuing the _croix de guerre_ with their rations\r\nnow,” the boys used to say. And indeed when one sees a French officer\r\nwithout some sort of decoration one feels instinctively that something\r\nmust be the matter with him.\r\n\r\nTo go or not to go? I am thinking of a compromise. I will postpone my\r\nsailing, take the furlough that is due to me. At the end of two weeks I\r\ncan calmly make up my mind.\r\n\r\n\r\nCauterets, January 20.\r\n\r\n“There’s only one poor feature about this place;” declared a boy today,\r\n“they won’t let you stay long enough.”\r\n\r\nThis is a representative but not a universal sentiment. Some of the boys\r\ndon’t like the snow, for Cauterets being high in the Pyrenees, is deep\r\nin snow at present. A few complain that they don’t get enough to eat. It\r\nis the breakfasts chiefly that fail to satisfy. The French having been\r\nused, time out of mind, to a _petit déjeuner_ of rolls and coffee,\r\nutterly fail to comprehend the American need for heartier sustenance.\r\nWhen the contracts with the hotels were made it was carefully stipulated\r\nthat eggs, meat or fish should be served at breakfast in addition to the\r\ncontinental menu, but the quantities were not stated and to a hearty\r\ndoughboy on a cold morning _one_ egg is a mere tantalization, if not an\r\ninsult. Every morning you may see them flocking in swarms to the Y. in\r\norder to round out their unsatisfactory breakfasts with hot chocolate\r\nand bread and jam. Yesterday I overheard some indignant splutterings\r\nfrom a little crowd at one of the canteen tables.\r\n\r\n“What’s the matter, boys?”\r\n\r\n“They gave us fish this morning for breakfast!”\r\n\r\n“They did?”\r\n\r\n“Yep! One sardine to each man!”\r\n\r\nYet in spite of a few such inharmonious notes, Cauterets, like Saint\r\nMalo and Aix-les-Bains, is instinct with the spirit of the American\r\nsoldier on leave. And the American soldier on leave is the Playboy of\r\nthe Western World. When the last doughboy has walked up the gang-plank\r\nof the last west-bound transport, I think the railway officials,\r\ngate-keepers, station agents, and train conductors all over France will\r\nsettle back in their chairs and draw a deep breath of relief.\r\n\r\nThe French poilu and the English Tommy have both questioned often and\r\nbitterly why it was that while they must ride third class, the American\r\nsoldier habitually traveled second and first; the answer being that you\r\nsimply can’t keep the doughboys out! It is the idea of the social\r\ndistinction implied by the _classes_ I fancy that makes half the\r\ntrouble. However that may be, it is absolutely against the rules of the\r\ngame for any doughboy to ride third class if there are any second class\r\ncoaches, and equally disgraceful to ride second class if there is a\r\nfirst. I myself have seen an American buck private with third class\r\ntransportation in his pocket stretching his legs in a luxurious first\r\nclass compartment seat, while a French general stood up outside in the\r\ncorridor! At another time I took a journey in a first class compartment\r\nbuilt for six, in which three English officers, an English titled Lady,\r\nher companion, two muddy doughboys and myself were all crowded. This was\r\nan anxious trip for me, for not only was I worried lest an indignant\r\nconductor should eject the doughboys, but I was also guiltily conscious\r\nof having paid only a second class fare myself!\r\n\r\nOne joyous company of eight lads on leave whom I encountered on the way\r\ndown here counted in their number one sergeant with a well-worn second\r\nclass pass. Things arranged themselves very simply. In the line-up at\r\nthe gate or in the car, the sergeant, heading the file, presented his\r\npass first, then, as it was handed back to him, slipped it behind his\r\nback to the next man and so on down the line. Once in a second class\r\ncompartment it was usually an easy matter to transfer to first. This\r\nsame crowd related to me how, when locked out of an empty first class\r\ncompartment by an irate conductor they merely waited until the next\r\nstop, then getting out climbed through the window on the off side of the\r\ntrain into the forbidden seats.\r\n\r\n“Golly, but that old frog got a shock when he looked in through the\r\nglass door and saw us sitting there!”\r\n\r\nThey were overcome with chagrin because at the last change one member of\r\nthe party allowed himself to be bullied by a hard-boiled M. P. into\r\nleaving the first class car.\r\n\r\n“He’s broken our record,” they mourned; “he’s disgraced the family!” And\r\nhalf their pleasure in the remainder of the trip was spoiled it was\r\nevident.\r\n\r\nIrrepressible, curious of all things, awed by nothing, the doughboy\r\ncares not a snap of his fingers for the whole of French Officialdom. An\r\nofficer told me how, when standing on a station platform the other day,\r\nan irate and husky doughboy sailed by him, headed for the baggage-room\r\nin search of somebody’s luggage.\r\n\r\n“If you hear a noise, Major,” he remarked in transit, “you’ll know that\r\nI’m stepping on a frog.”\r\n\r\nThe French railway system affords him a never-failing topic for\r\namusement. And truly it has its quaint points. On the trip down we\r\npassed over one line where the heating system for the cars consisted\r\nentirely of long flat metal cans filled with hot water which were shoved\r\nin under our feet, so that, no matter how chilly the rest of us might\r\nbe, our toes at least could travel in comfort; while on the walls of\r\neach coach, we observed with glee, was an official notice requesting the\r\npassengers to refrain from throwing objects such as _empty bottles_ out\r\nthe windows as numerous casualties among the employees had resulted from\r\nthis practice!\r\n\r\nThe doughboy passes everywhere by virtue of the magic words, “_no\r\ncompree_.” Traveling he develops a stupidity that is absolute and\r\nunshakable.\r\n\r\n“I never understand anything they say,” chuckled one youngster joyously,\r\n“until they begin to talk about something to eat”.\r\n\r\nWonderful tales are told of escapades and adventures; such as the story\r\nof the boy who started out to spend his leave at Aix-les-Bains and\r\ntraveled half over Italy before he came back, all on the the strength of\r\nthe pass-word “onion-stew” and an unidentified document that happened to\r\nhave a red seal attached. Common rumour has it that the official report\r\nrecords sixty thousand A. W. O. L.s at the present date in the A. E. F.\r\nin France. I don’t know whether this is correct, but I rather hope it\r\nis. Now that the war is won I am glad that in spite of Provost Marshals\r\nand M. P.s some of the boys at least are on the way to discovering that\r\nthere is something more to France than just “mud and kilometers.”\r\n\r\n\r\nParis, February 7.\r\n\r\nI’m going to stay. If I went home now I would feel like a quitter all\r\nthe rest of my life. I don’t know where I’m going. They asked me if I\r\nwould like to go to Germany but I said no, I didn’t want to look at\r\nGermans. I shall have to stay here in Paris for a week or so anyway in\r\norder to get that wretched business of a broken tooth, which the\r\nChristmas caramel at Mauvages began, straightened out. In the meantime,\r\nI am doing what I can in a perfectly amateur and impromptu way to help\r\nyoung America see Paris.\r\n\r\nParis is the lodestar of France for the A. E. F. From every part of the\r\ncountry it draws them like a magnet. When on leave, no matter from what\r\nportion of France they may have come or what corner they may be bound\r\nfor, they always contrive to get there by way of Paris. If the R. T. O.\r\ninstructs them to change to another line before they reach the city,\r\nthey arrive there just the same, to explain blandly to the M. P. that\r\nthey went to sleep on the train: “and when I woke up, why here I was in\r\nParis!” What dodges the doughboys haven’t worked in order to circumvent\r\nthe M. P.s and get into Paris without official permission, or once in\r\nParis to stay longer than the short time allotted them, would be beyond\r\nhuman imagination. There is one story current, for whose truth though, I\r\ncannot vouch, of an American private who passed a week in the forbidden\r\ncity in the uniform of his cousin, a lieutenant in the French Army. At\r\nthe time of the signing of the armistice, for several days the M. P.s’\r\nvigilance was relaxed and boys from all over France swarmed to the city\r\nto participate in the festivities, but since then the penalties for the\r\nunlucky ones who are caught have grown more and more severe.\r\n\r\nYesterday by request I took two boys to the Louvre. We wandered through\r\nthe galleries of Greek and Roman sculptures. One boy, looking at the\r\nyellowed and discolored surfaces, declared himself bitterly\r\ndisappointed. He had heard that the statues were all real marble here,\r\nbut it was perfectly plain that they were nothing but plaster\r\nimitations! The other boy asked naïvely if the mutilated statues were\r\n“meant to represent people who had had their heads chopped off.” After\r\nabout half an hour they consulted their watches, announced that we had\r\njust time to get to a movie show, and wouldn’t I go with them?\r\n\r\nBut if the finer points of Greek art are lost on many, there are plenty\r\nof other things which they do appreciate.\r\n\r\n“Can you climb to the top of the Eiffel tower?”\r\n\r\n“Where is the church that the shell struck on Good Friday?”\r\n\r\n“What would you advise me to buy to send home to Mother?”\r\n\r\n“How often does the Ferris Wheel go?”\r\n\r\n“Is there any place in Paris where one can get ice-cream soda?”\r\n\r\nThese are some of the questions that they ask you. Some go to the Opera,\r\nsitting invariably in the best seats to the amazement of the French\r\npeople. Yesterday I stopped at the box-office to buy some tickets. A boy\r\nstanding just inside the door spoke to me.\r\n\r\n“I beg your pardon, were you going to buy a seat for this afternoon?”\r\n\r\n“No,” I said; “for Saturday.”\r\n\r\n“I have an extra ticket. I’d be glad to have you use it.”\r\n\r\nHe went on to tell me that he was taking the six o’clock train, that he\r\nhad bought tickets for himself and a friend for the matinee as a last\r\npleasure, but that his friend had failed him. I hesitated, uncertain.\r\n“What’s the opera?” I asked, just because it was something to say.\r\n\r\n“It’s La Bohème,” he said. I fell.\r\n\r\n“I’m mighty glad,” he told me, “I was just about to go out and pick up a\r\nchicken on the street, when you came in.”\r\n\r\nThe opera was a dream of loveliness. I felt as if I must have done\r\nsomething very good indeed in some previous existence to be thus\r\nrewarded.\r\n\r\nToday I encountered two boys who told me how they had “done” Paris.\r\n\r\n“We stopped at a store and bought a bunch of post cards, all the famous\r\nbuildings and everything. Then we got a taxi. After that all we’d do was\r\nto show the chauffeur a post card and he’d drive us to it,—then we’d\r\nshow him another one, and so we kept a-goin’ until we’d seen most all of\r\nParis. But gee! That taxi bill was a fright!”\r\n\r\nThis afternoon, coming down the “Boulevard de Wop,” as the boys call the\r\nBoulevard des Italiens, I paused beside a fiacre, attached to a\r\nparticularly wretched looking old nag, which was drawn up by the\r\nsidewalk. Into it were piling merrily some eight or nine doughboys, the\r\ncabman fairly dancing on his seat as he uttered frantic but perfectly\r\nunheeded expostulations. Finally as the cabby appeared to be developing\r\napoplexy, I spoke up.\r\n\r\n“Boys, you know that _really_ that broken-down old beast never _could_\r\npull all of you!”\r\n\r\nWhereupon half of them immediately piled out again. One of the remaining\r\nones leaned out of the fiacre.\r\n\r\n“Say Lady, can you talk French?” he demanded earnestly.\r\n\r\n“Why a little.”\r\n\r\n“Well tell that old guy for me, will you,” he indicated the still\r\ndisgruntled _cocher_ who, like the rest of his tribe, was crowned with\r\nan ornamental “stove-pipe,” “that I want him to lend me his hat.”\r\n\r\nTonight I met a girl I know who is in the Hut Equipment Department. She\r\nhas just returned from an extended tour of inspection. I told her I\r\ndidn’t know where my next assignment was to be.\r\n\r\n“Why don’t you go to Verdun?” she asked. “The conditions about there are\r\nworse than any other place in France. Men are commiting suicide there\r\nevery day.”\r\n\r\nSo I wrote a note to the Office asking that I be sent to Verdun.\r\n\r\n\r\nBar-le-Duc, February 16.\r\n\r\nSomewhere here in Bar-le-Duc there is an extraordinary thing. It is the\r\nMausoleum of René of Chalons, prince of Orange, and designed in\r\naccordance with his wishes. Against an ermine mantle, under a rich\r\narmorial crest, stands a skeleton or rather the rotting carcass of a\r\nman, half bone and half disintegrating tissue, holding aloft in one\r\nghastly hand, his heart, an offering, so the story goes, to his lady\r\nwife.\r\n\r\nEvery time I am in Bar-le-Duc, even if it is only an hour between\r\ntrains, I go hunting for that skeleton; but the nearest I have come so\r\nfar, is to find it on a picture post card. Once I thought I had surely\r\nrun it to earth when I came upon a strange old church built so as to\r\nbridge a narrow moat-like canal, and so low that it seemed as if the\r\nwater must ooze up through the stone slabs of the floor, but no.\r\n\r\nI am here at Bar-le-Duc for a few days because it seems that after all\r\nit isn’t quite certain whether I had better go to Verdun or to Souilly.\r\nWhile my fate is being decided, I am acting as a sort of errand-girl,\r\nspecial messenger and Jack-of-all-jobs here at Headquarters.\r\n\r\nThis morning I went out in a flivver to do an errand. The driver told me\r\nhow, a few days ago, he had carried a young French girl all over the\r\ncountry-side looking for her aviator-lover’s grave. Finally with the\r\nhelp of a French officer they had found it. The girl had placed a wreath\r\non the grave, said a little prayer and turned away. He showed me the\r\nplace, three grey wooden crosses, one with a china wreath on it, marking\r\nthe field where a large aviation camp had once been and now quite the\r\nloneliest and most deserted spot in the world.\r\n\r\nComing back, I was sent to the Provost Marshal’s office to telephone.\r\nWhile I waited for my connection two M. P.s brought in a prisoner. He\r\nbelonged to the —— Division which reached France in September. Two days\r\nafter he landed he went A. W. O. L. and had been missing ever since. By\r\nsome unknown means he had managed to acquire a typewriter and all\r\nwinter, it appeared, he had been living in the woods supporting himself\r\nby typing faked travel orders and selling them to the soldiers. He was a\r\nheavy-set fellow, sullen and taciturn under their questioning. They went\r\nthrough his pockets and turned out the collection on the table; chewing\r\ngum, tobacco, a shaving-set, old newspapers, screws and nails, buttons\r\nand string and matches and pins, pencils, and post cards, a knife and\r\nthree toothbrushes.\r\n\r\nBar-le-Duc I understand does a thriving business in A. W. O. L.s. One of\r\nthe M. P.s told me of a lad who, when asked for his papers, took to his\r\nheels and was promptly pursued.\r\n\r\n“I chased him all over town, and finally I ran him into the canal,” he\r\nnarrated joyfully. “He stood out there with the water up to his waist\r\nwhile I stood on the bank and shied stones at him. And he had on a serge\r\nuniform too.”\r\n\r\n“How did it end?” I asked.\r\n\r\n“Oh I let him go; I figured if he wanted to get away that bad he had a\r\nright to.”\r\n\r\nUp this same canal a few weeks ago came a flotilla of French submarines\r\nbound for the Rhine, the sailors startling the inhabitants by their\r\nsudden appearance in the streets in their naval uniforms and their\r\ncasual references to their ships close at hand. Somebody was unkind\r\nenough to declare that the subs had started their journey from the coast\r\non Armistice Day, but I am sure this must be a libel.\r\n\r\nThis afternoon I asked if I might work in the canteen. This is in a\r\nFrench house, a few doors beyond the beautiful Officers’ Club, the home\r\nof one of the wealthy manufacturers of the _Confiture de Bar-le-Duc_,\r\nlent by him, rent-free for the use of the Americans during the war. In\r\nthe course of the afternoon I became the possessor of a puppy-dog\r\npresented me by a motor-truck driver, who, following some careless\r\nremark of mine about wishing I had a puppy, dropped the scared little\r\nblack thing in my arms and fled. As soon as I could collect my senses I\r\nflew around the counter and out the door after him, calling on him to\r\ntake his dog back. But when I reached the street, motor-truck and driver\r\nboth had vanished. I would have loved to keep the little beggar, but\r\nhere I am, a transient traveller bound for nobody knows where; what\r\ncould I do? I explained my dilemma to the grinning crowd in the canteen.\r\nOne of the boys spoke up.\r\n\r\n“I’ll take him and give him to my French girl,” he said. I relinquished\r\nthe little fellow regretfully. I hope Mademoiselle makes him a good\r\nfoster-mother.\r\n\r\nA little while later I noticed a boy at the counter who wore three\r\nservice stripes and two wound stripes. “What’s your division?” I asked.\r\nHe told me. He belonged to my old regiment! He had been in the Milk\r\nBattalion at Goncourt, and he remembered me. He was a Class B man now\r\nand in the post office at Bar-le-Duc.\r\n\r\n“What of the rest?” I asked.\r\n\r\n“They’re mostly dead,” he answered, and he told me how, after one\r\ncharge, out of the whole Company M six men and the captain had come\r\nback.\r\n\r\nI broke down and cried; I couldn’t help it. The boy, embarrassed, drew\r\naway. He is the only man I have seen out of my regiment since last\r\nMarch, and all he could say was, “They’re mostly dead!” Dead at\r\nChâteau-Thierry, dead on the Marne, dead by Soissons, dead in honor,\r\ndead with glory. America, will you ever forget?\r\n\r\n\r\nBar-le-Duc, February 18.\r\n\r\nEveryone here is incensed this morning over the action of the French\r\ntroops in the matter of the theatre. It seems that the Americans had\r\narranged a schedule of movies and shows to be given at the local theatre\r\na month in advance. A soldier show was billed for tonight, the company\r\nhad reached town, the audience was beginning to gather from the nearby\r\nvillages, when the French troops who began to arrive in town yesterday\r\nannounced that they had their own exclusive and immediate uses for the\r\nbuilding. All efforts to arbitrate the matter have so far failed. And\r\nnow word comes that a French lieutenant in order to be ready to repel\r\nany possible move on the part of the Americans to take possession of the\r\ntheatre for the night has had his bed made up in one of the boxes!\r\n\r\nIt is the greatest of pities that there should be this wretched element\r\nof friction between the two allies. If every American could have been\r\nmiraculously whisked out of France the day after the armistice was\r\nsigned the doughboy would likely have been to this day a bit of a\r\npopular French idol. It is this hanging about with no ostensible end in\r\nview that frays nerves on both sides and leads to a mutual stepping on\r\neach other’s toes. No two nationalities I am convinced could be thrown\r\ninto such an intimate and trying relationship and produce perfect\r\nharmony. There must inevitably be a clash of temperaments. The case in\r\nthis instance, as I see it, is complicated to an extraordinary degree,\r\nwith human foibles and failings a-plenty on both sides.\r\n\r\nWe Americans have undoubtedly been guilty of bad manners. Quite openly\r\nand persistently the doughboy has called the Frenchman “frog” to his\r\nface and this the French have by no means enjoyed. The odd part of the\r\nthing is that the doughboy can give no explanation of the nickname.\r\n\r\n“But why do you call them frogs?” I ask the boys. Usually they look\r\nquite blank.\r\n\r\n“It’s ’cause they sound like frogs when they talk,” explained one lad.\r\n\r\n“’Cause they jump around like frogs when they get excited,” offered\r\nanother.\r\n\r\nNot one of them suspects that this nickname is a curious survival of the\r\nold term of contempt “Frog-eaters” applied to the French by the English\r\nin the days when they were enemies instead of allies!\r\n\r\nUndoubtedly too the feminine factor, leading as it has to jealousy, has\r\nplayed its share in arousing antagonism.\r\n\r\n“The chief victories of the Americans in France,” declared a French\r\nofficer bitterly the other day, “are his conquests over the feminine\r\nheart!”\r\n\r\nIndeed from the start it has been an open secret that the\r\n“Mademoiselles” have taken a prodigious fancy to the American soldier.\r\nThis is partly because he possesses the charm of novelty, partly because\r\nhe has money and can procure chocolate and cigarettes and partly just\r\nbecause he is himself.\r\n\r\n“There are three thousand men in this town and three girls,” ran a\r\npostal addressed by a joyous youngster on leave to his lieutenant; “I’m\r\ngoing with one of them and Abe has the other two.”\r\n\r\nAnd who can blame the poilu for a certain amount of resentment, when,\r\ncoming back from the trenches he has discovered that a dashing American\r\nstationed at an engineering camp in his home town has supplanted him in\r\nthe affections of his sweetheart?\r\n\r\nOn the American side there is of course the old grievance of the\r\novercharging.\r\n\r\n“D’you know why you don’t see any Jews in France?” asked a lad of me the\r\nother day, “It’s because they couldn’t make a living.”\r\n\r\nIn part, this sense of grievance, as I see it, is justifiable. An\r\nofficer told me not long ago that he had recently been left behind when\r\nhis outfit moved out from a village, as “Mop Up Officer” to settle the\r\nclaims of the townspeople for damage done by the soldiers during their\r\nstay,—a pane of glass, a truss of straw, the tine of a pitchfork.\r\nHearing a commotion in the town square he looked out; the town crier was\r\nannouncing to the populace that now the Americans had gone the price of\r\nwine would be cut from five francs a bottle to two. But in part this\r\nsense of grievance is unjustifiable, for the American has in no small\r\nmeasure brought this state of affairs upon himself. From the start the\r\ndoughboy’s disgust with the flimsy paper bills and the puzzling tricky\r\nscheme of the francs, sous and centimes engendered a carelessness toward\r\nFrench money which the tradespeople took as a delightful indication of\r\nunlimited wealth. “But everyone is rich in America!” I have heard them\r\ndeclare with childish conviction. So prices began to rise and presently,\r\nwith the prices, the doughboy’s resentment, and then the poilu’s; for\r\nthe rise automatically put all luxuries out of the French soldier’s\r\nreach and this of course he in turn blamed bitterly on the “rich”\r\nAmerican. Indeed the sending of a large body of men paid at the rate of\r\na dollar a day into a country where the native troops were paid at the\r\nrate of five cents a day was a social-economic error which somehow, say\r\nby some system of reserve pay such as the Australians have, should have\r\nbeen avoided.\r\n\r\nThen too, the American won’t haggle. The Frenchman, as a rule, won’t buy\r\nunless he can. Prices are fixed with the expectation of a compromise\r\nafter bargaining. Not easily shall I forget a dramatic scene witnessed\r\nat the “Rag Fair” at the Porte Maillot in Paris between a prosperous\r\nhouseholder and a “rag” seller over a second-hand padlock. The seller\r\nremained firm in demanding six cents for the padlock. The householder\r\nwas equally determined not to pay more than five. Finally the\r\nhouseholder with great dignity withdrew, only to be called back by a\r\ndespairing yelp from the seller. He had capitulated. To the American\r\nsuch a performance seems both tedious and undignified; he either takes\r\nthe article at the first price asked or leaves it.\r\n\r\nNor can it be denied that the doughboy tends to be a bit of a prodigal.\r\nChief of his spendthrift weaknesses are two; he will pay almost any\r\nprice for sweets, sink almost any sum in a present for his girl. Then\r\ntoo the universal custom of gambling in the army, leading to swollen\r\nfortunes for the favoured ones, has helped to establish standards of\r\nextravagance. An officer in charge of a company belonging to a negro\r\nlabor regiment told me of seeing two of his boys in a café sit down to a\r\ntwenty-five franc bottle of champagne and then, the taste for some\r\nreason not quite suiting their fancies, walk out leaving the bottle\r\npractically untouched behind!\r\n\r\nIn the light of such incidents as this, who can blame the French people\r\nfor regarding the American as a sort of gift from God beneficently\r\nallowed them at the time of their greatest national impoverishment, for\r\nthe replenishing of their depleted pocketbooks?\r\n\r\n\r\nVerdun, February 20.\r\n\r\nThe little narrow-gauge train pulled us in here from Bar-le-Duc at ten\r\no’clock last night, a thirty mile run and six hours to make it! When I\r\nasked for a first class fare at the station I noticed an odd expression\r\non the ticket-seller’s face. “They’re all the same,” he said; “all\r\nsecond class.” Arrived at the train I understood. The coaches were\r\nfilthy and furnished with straight-backed wooden benches; a heap of\r\nrubbish surrounded the rickety stove in the centre. Shortly after we\r\ncrawled out of Bar-le-Duc it began to rain. Half the windows were\r\ninnocent of glass. The rain beat in through the empty sashes. Presently\r\nit grew dark. Several of the passengers, American, reached in their\r\npockets and brought out a few grimy candle-ends. We made little\r\ngrease-spots on the benches and stuck the candles there, but the gusts\r\nof wind from the empty windows kept blowing them out, so half the time\r\nwe jogged along in darkness.\r\n\r\nAmong the passengers was a little old Frenchman with one arm. He was\r\nreturning to his native village in the devastated area the other side of\r\nVerdun, after an absence of four years. With him was his young son, an\r\nimmature lad of seventeen.\r\n\r\n“_J’ai tine passion_,” declared the old man with startling fervour;\r\n“_j’ai une passion véritable de revoir le village de ma naissance!_”\r\n\r\nIn all probability he was returning to nothing but a crumbled heap of\r\nstones.\r\n\r\n“You are very brave,” I told him.\r\n\r\nAh but it was for them, the old, to set an example for the young! It was\r\nthey who should lead the way! It was they who should rebuild France! His\r\nfrail old body fairly shook with the strength of his emotion. What a\r\nstrange, thrilling, tragic pilgrimage!\r\n\r\nVerdun resembled nothing but a ruin mercifully wrapped in darkness as we\r\npassed through the gate and made our way up the hill. We had found,\r\nluckily, a guide who had a lantern; nowhere else in all the city was so\r\nmuch as a gleam of light to be seen. In places, as we passed, the shells\r\nof houses still stood, staring down with empty eyes at us, in other\r\nplaces there were nothing but rubble mounds with here and there a narrow\r\njagged bit of wall or a naked chimney standing out like a lonely\r\nmonolith.\r\n\r\nHeadquarters offices are at the Château on the summit of the hill close\r\nto the Cathedral, one of the few buildings left undamaged in this part\r\nof town, a rambling, ungainly, rather gloomy structure. The second story\r\nconsists almost entirely of a series of great empty barren loft-like\r\nstore-rooms. In one of these, known as the Ladies, Cold Storage, I have\r\nmy habitation. Supposed to be a sort of one-night-stand dormitory for\r\nfemale tourists,—nurses chiefly,—who are touring the battle-fields, the\r\nLadies, Cold Storage is a large dusty garret with grimy rough-plastered\r\nwalls, without a window or as much as a crack to let in any light or air\r\nexcept for a few small slits in the roof where the rain leaks in. A\r\nstove, a long row of cots and a tin basin on a shelf surmounted by a\r\nbroken piece of looking-glass are its only furnishings. However, the L.\r\nC. S. boasts one luxury, it is equipped with electric lights. This\r\nhelps—when the current is turned on!—when it isn’t, we light a candle\r\nstub and stick it in an old milk can. The electricity is generated\r\nunderground in the Citadel. When the Americans first came to Verdun some\r\nenterprising electricians tapped the wires and had forty lights working\r\nbefore the French knew anything about it. Upon discovery the French cut\r\noff the Americans, only to find shortly afterwards that another\r\nconnection had been made. This absurd performance was repeated no less\r\nthan seven times. After the seventh time the French gave up.\r\n\r\nWe were fairly frightened out of bed this morning by a most horrible\r\nhubbub,—a Klaxon gas-alarm which is used to call the guests to\r\nbreakfast. Having heard it I am quite convinced that if Gabriel wishes\r\nto do the job efficiently on the last day, he will scrap his trumpet and\r\ntake a Klaxon.\r\n\r\nAfter breakfast we newcomers hurried out to get a glimpse of the town.\r\nThere were plenty of others likewise occupied as Verdun is a veritable\r\nmagnet for A. E. F. tourists. The Cathedral is closed to visitors but we\r\nhappened upon two French officers who kindly took us through. The roof\r\nis badly damaged and the stained glass of the windows shattered to bits,\r\nbut beyond that the Cathedral is comparatively unharmed. I was much\r\nembarrassed when the officers informed me that the _sacrés pierres_, the\r\nsacred stones from the altar, had been stolen and presumably sent as\r\nsouvenirs to America. At first I pretended not to understand, but they\r\ntook such pains to explain, finally taking me to the altar and showing\r\nme where the little marble slabs had been dug out, that I finally had to\r\nadmit I understood. The two nurses who were with us were anxious to\r\nclimb the clock-tower, but this, we found, was strictly _défendu_. All\r\nthrough the war, we learned afterwards, the clock in the tower had been\r\nkept going by the faithful verger who refused to leave his post, and\r\nwhat’s more, it had kept time. But a short while ago the clock had\r\nstarted “skipping.” A party of American boys had just visited the tower.\r\nUpon investigation it proved that one of the wheels was missing!\r\nSometimes I think the French are very patient with us.\r\n\r\nEverywhere we went we came upon German prisoners engaged in the most\r\nleisurely fashion in cleaning up. There are several thousands of them\r\nhere and more to come. Verdun is to rise from her ruins and live once\r\nmore. Yet she can never be in any sense the stately city that once she\r\nwas; for while the business and poorer portions of the city below the\r\nhill are not irreparably damaged, the finer part with its stately\r\nmansions and exquisite specimens of mediæval architecture is wrecked\r\nbeyond repair. The most serious obstacle in the way of making at least\r\nsome small portions of the city habitable at present lies in the great\r\ndifficulty of obtaining window-glass.\r\n\r\nFrom the Cathedral we went to the Canteen-in-the-Convent. How the nuns\r\nwould stare, I thought, if they could see their virgin precincts in\r\npossession of a mob of boys in khaki, white and black, interspersed with\r\nthe blue-coated poilus! Across the back of the building runs a wide\r\nterrace, once worn by pious feet of patient sisters engaged in holy\r\nmeditations. Here among the lounging boys stand life-sized carved and\r\ncolored images of saints and angels. Their size of course prevents them\r\nfrom traveling to America as souvenirs, but even so they must stand\r\nwitness to the irreverence of young America, for the Angel Gabriel is\r\nhideous in a German gas-mask!\r\n\r\nAfter dinner we went on a trip through the Citadel, that vast\r\nunderground soldier-city with its miles of corridors and rooms enough to\r\nharbor a whole army, a little world deep underneath the earth. We saw\r\nthe bakery which bakes bread not only for the whole garrison but for all\r\nthe troops in the vicinity; the Foyer, a writing and recreation hall,\r\nnamed in honor of President Wilson; the movie theatre; and the hospital\r\nwith its wards and operating room,—what a nightmare horror I thought to\r\nbe sick in those damp and dimly-lighted subterranean caverns! But we\r\nwere not allowed to see more than the outer door of the chapel which\r\nthey say is sumptuous, since it is enriched by all the costly\r\nfurnishings and precious images moved there for safety’s sake from the\r\nCathedral. Nor were we shown the underground café where, I have been\r\ntold, an unusually good brand of beer is sold.\r\n\r\nFrom the Citadel, rumour has it, tunnels lead out to the circle of forts\r\nthat form the defences of Verdun, but if you ask a Frenchman if this is\r\nso, he only looks wise and keeps mum.\r\n\r\n\r\nVerdun, February 25.\r\n\r\nI don’t believe there is another canteen quite like my canteen in the\r\nwhole of France. It is a canteen for French civilians. The one-time\r\ninhabitants of Verdun and the devastated area beyond are allowed by the\r\ngovernment, it seems, just twenty-four hours in which to visit their\r\nformer homes, after which they must return as there is no food for them\r\nhere and very little shelter. In return for many favours the French\r\nauthorities asked the Y. to co-operate with them in running a sort of\r\nrest-room for these refugees; they supplying a detail, and we supplying\r\nthe materials to make hot chocolate which is given away, and a secretary\r\nto take charge. The canteen is in the Collège Buvignier at the foot of\r\nthe hill. There is a _dortoir_ in the building also, in charge of the\r\nman who was once manager of the principal hotel in the city; two long\r\nhalls full of cots with straw mattresses where the refugees may pass the\r\nnight. My assignment to this canteen is only to be temporary.\r\n\r\nThe room where my canteen is must have once been quite beautiful,\r\nhigh-ceilinged with wainscot panelling below and embossed leather\r\ncovering the walls above. Even now in its state of dingy disrepair, with\r\nhalf the panes in the tall arched windows replaced by dirty cloth, it\r\nkeeps something of its old dignity and charm. Beyond the main room is\r\nanother smaller one, connected by two doors, in which the detail lives\r\nand in which we make our chocolate.\r\n\r\nWhen I took over the canteen from the man who had been in charge of it,\r\nit was absolutely bare except for four tables and some backless wooden\r\nbenches. My first act on assuming charge was to clean house, my second\r\nwas to persuade the detail to make the very watery chocolate richer.\r\nAfter that we proceeded to refurnish and adorn. We ran a frieze of\r\nwar-pictures in color, taken from a child’s pictorial _Histoire de la\r\nGuerre_ around the top of the wainscoting, hung French and American\r\nflags from the chandeliers, teased the French authorities into bringing\r\nus some nice upholstered armchairs for the old ladies to sit in, and,\r\nfinally, put a little pot of primroses or snow-drops, dug with a broken\r\ntile from a ruined garden, in the centre of each table. Then a kind\r\nsecretary bound for Bar-le-Duc was persuaded to go shopping for us and\r\nbrought back an array of French magazines, hand-picked, and an\r\nassortment of toys to amuse the kiddies who must often wait here with\r\ntheir families between trains, though so far, it must be confessed, it\r\nis chiefly the detail who have been amused by them. And now I am\r\nwondering what there is to do next.\r\n\r\nBesides the hot chocolate, we carry on a trade in bread, a huge sackfull\r\nof which is brought us fresh every day from the underground bakery on\r\nthe back of a little round-faced poilu; and we do a brisk business in\r\nchecking parcels, without checks. Yesterday a rabbit was left all day in\r\nour care. I was sorry for the poor beast cooped up in the little box and\r\nwanted to give it a drink of water, but the poilus insisted that this\r\nwould be fatal. Whether this might possibly be a zoölogical fact, or is\r\njust part of the national prejudice against water, I can’t determine.\r\n\r\nAt first, remembering my difficulties with the French Army at Mauvages,\r\nI was a little apprehensive as to how my two poilus, Emil and Guillaume\r\nand I might get along. But though I am sure they think me the oddest\r\ncreature in the world, and my presence here unconventional beyond words,\r\nyet their behaviour could not possibly be more courteous, considerate\r\nand deferential. They won’t even allow me to wash the chocolate cups.\r\n\r\n“Mademoiselle will soil her hands!”\r\n\r\nAnd they are forever telling me that I am working too hard. “But\r\nMademoiselle will be fatigued!” Which is so absurd as to fairly\r\nexasperate me.\r\n\r\nBesides Emil and Guillaume we have four soldier friends-of-the-family,\r\nas it were, who also frequent the back room. The canteen is supposed to\r\nbe a strictly civilian affair, but we make an exception in favour of the\r\nfour _camarades_, and they repay us by helping chop the stove-wood which\r\nis stacked in a great pile outside the door and is nothing more or less\r\nthan the stakes to which were once fastened barbed-wire entanglements.\r\nEach stake still bears two little rings of wire around it and every few\r\ndays one has to clear out the accumulation of barbed-wire entanglements\r\nfrom the chocolate-stove. _Les défences de Verdun_ the poilus call the\r\nwood-pile. The poilus are all artillerymen from a regiment of “75s.”\r\nGuillaume has brought down three Boche planes, he tells me, and Emil\r\nfive. One of the poilus is a handsome brigadier, or corporal, who wears\r\nwooden shoes. I said something about _sabots_ the other day. But don’t\r\nthey wear _sabots_ in America? The poilus were astonished to learn that\r\nwooden shoes were unknown among us! There is also a sergeant who is the\r\naristocrat of our little circle, a dreamy looking lad, a student of\r\narchitecture at the Beaux Arts. Yesterday he shyly proffered me an\r\nenvelope; in it was a pretty pen-and-ink sketch of two little girls, one\r\nin the costume of Alsace, the other of Lorraine, proffering bouquets,\r\nand underneath was written, “Souvenir of a Frenchman who thanks America\r\nfor having given the victory more quickly.” Our poilu friends are\r\nconstantly straying into the back room in order to read the newspapers\r\nhere and to get a cup of hot chocolate. Every now and then they all get\r\ntogether and hold a _vin rouge_ tea party. On these occasions it is\r\nevidently a mystery to them why, though I join them in eating bread and\r\ncheese, I always refuse the _vin rouge_!\r\n\r\nThe politeness of the poilus is equalled by that of the clientele. They\r\nare extraordinarily grateful for what little we do for them. Today an\r\nold lady, in spite of anything I could say, insisted on tipping me with\r\na two franc piece! I spent it buying chocolates and cigarettes for the\r\npoilus at the Canteen-in-the-Convent. Every class of society flows into\r\nmy little canteen from gently bred ladies under the escort of immaculate\r\nofficers to old men who resemble nothing but the forlornest vagabonds.\r\nThe cheerfulness and courage of the refugees in general is astonishing.\r\nOne would think that a room full of people engaged in such a mournful\r\nmission would be a gloomy place, but on the contrary, although\r\noccasionally you see a woman quietly sobbing, at most times we fairly\r\nbuzz with pleasant sociability. The women come in with faces bright with\r\nexcitement. “Oh the poor Cathedral!” they cry.\r\n\r\n“Did you find anything of your home?” I ask. For a moment the tears swim\r\nin their brave eyes. “_Rien_” they answer shaking their heads.\r\n“Nothing!”\r\n\r\nToday an old man in a long white apron smock was the centre of attention\r\nhere. He was busy searching the ruins of his house for buried treasure.\r\nEvery little while he would come back to the canteen with the fruits of\r\nhis pathetic salvaging,—a few silver spoons, some paint brushes, a bolt\r\nof black velvet ribbon,—place them in a basket and then return to look\r\nfor more. Two German prisoners were digging for him. Finally he came\r\nback with six unbroken champagne glasses and a face scored with tragedy.\r\nHe had been hoping against hope to recover the treasures in his wine\r\ncellar but he was too late, not a bottle was there left!\r\n\r\n\r\nVerdun, February 28.\r\n\r\nThis morning I went out on a truck to Fort Douaumont. This is the fort\r\nwhich was captured by the Germans, held by them for five months, and\r\nthen retaken by the French and marks the enemy’s nearest approach to the\r\ncity. Oddly enough the French were the gainers through this occupation\r\nto the extent of a splendid electric lighting system introduced by the\r\nGermans into the fort!\r\n\r\nA modern fort does not resemble in the least the idea that one has of a\r\n“fort.” Viewed from outside it is nothing more or less than a hole in\r\nthe ground. Once inside we had the sense of being in a monster ant-hill\r\nas we followed our guide through a network of tunnelled corridors. We\r\nsaw the room of the Commandant with its wonderful relief maps both\r\nFrench and German of the Verdun hills, we saw the war-museum, the Foyer,\r\nthe store-rooms and engine-rooms, the magazine rooms where the big\r\nshells were stacked like cord wood, and we climbed up into the turrets\r\nof the disappearing guns. In this strange fort which has been both\r\nfriend and enemy we looked through one empty doorway into a pit of ruins\r\nopen to the sky, under the wreckage sixteen Germans lay, they said; it\r\nwas here that a French shell had broken through. We passed by another\r\ndoor which bore a sign on it announcing that this was the tomb of five\r\nFrench mitrailleurs who had been killed by a German shell in the room\r\nwithin; instead of burying the bodies they had simply sealed up the door\r\nand left them. Then we ducked through a little low door and climbed up\r\nover the hillock which forms the roof of the fort as it were. All about\r\nus stretched the abomination of desolation of the battle-fields, wracked\r\ntortured earth, seared and scarred into a yellow-grey desert waste. Here\r\nand there lay bones, human bones, sometimes scattered loose, sometimes\r\ngathered in a little heap with a rusty helmet and a broken rifle lying\r\nclose beside them. Only a few hundred feet from the road, the man who\r\nguided the party told us, he came yesterday upon two unburied bodies.\r\n\r\nTo the northeast we could just discern a large wooden cross. A French\r\nofficer who was stationed at the fort pointed it out to us. Here, he\r\nsaid, lay buried no less than twelve hundred French soldiers. They had\r\nbeen given a line of trench to hold, the officers were taken from them,\r\nthey were to expect no reinforcements or relief. They were left there\r\nknowing it was only a question of days or hours. When the French finally\r\nreached the line again every man was dead. So they left them where they\r\nlay and filled the trench in over them, but each man’s rifle they took\r\nand planted upright in the earth beside him. There is a heroic theme for\r\na poet!\r\n\r\nWhen I reached the canteen again I found a ragged disconsolate old soul\r\noccupying one of the benches. On seeing me he began a sad recital of\r\nsore feet, ending with the petition that I procure him a pair of rubber\r\nboots and emphasizing the point by taking off his shoes then and there\r\nand exhibiting his troubles,—which weren’t pretty,—to me. I was\r\nperplexed, not knowing what to do, when the friendly M. P. on the beat\r\nhappened in; so I put the case up to him. He told me that there was a\r\nsalvage dump at the station. We set out together and succeeded in\r\nfinding an enormous pair of rubber overshoes, and, what’s more, in\r\ngetting away with them. The old man was pleased as Punch, put them on\r\nand hobbled off in them. Tonight someone told me a melancholy tale. An\r\nM. P. stationed upon the hill had spied an old Frenchman going by in a\r\npair of American overshoes and had straightway held him up and ordered\r\nhim to relinquish what was Government property. And the old man perforce\r\nhad to sit down in the street and take off his shoes.\r\n\r\nSpeaking of boots reminds me of the tale told me by a doughboy the other\r\nday; a tale of a pair of tan shoes, handsome, shiny, new tan shoes which\r\nwas sold to every man in turn in his whole company only to be finally\r\npurchased as a bargain at thirty-five francs by an unsuspecting\r\nFrenchman. They were beautiful shoes, the boy assured me, the only\r\ntrouble was that they both happened to be for the left foot.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VIII: CONFLANS—PIONEERS, M.P.’s AND OTHERS\r\n\r\n\r\nJarny, March 2.\r\n\r\nI am living in a hospital. Being in the occupied territory, the hospital\r\nhas been for the last four years, of course, a German hospital. Over the\r\ndoorways are painted such pious mottoes as “_Gruss Gott!_” and the\r\ntheatre, for there is an amusement hall in the building, is adorned with\r\na back-drop on which a Siegfried-esque hero overlooks an ideal German\r\nlandscape wherein a picture-book castle perches on the top of an\r\nimpossible mountain. At the other end of the hall is painted an enormous\r\niron cross. The masterpiece of the collection, though, is on the wall of\r\nthe basketball court and is, naturally, a portrait of His Late Imperial\r\nMajesty, although one indentifies him rather by inference than\r\nrecognition, for the countenance having recently served for a pistol\r\ntarget is battered almost out of human semblance. The main part of the\r\nhospital is occupied by the Y.; in the wings some two hundred ordnance\r\nboys are quartered; we ladies find comfortable lodging in the operating\r\nroom. There are five of us here at present, two American girls, besides\r\nmyself, and two Englishwomen. These latter are ladies of high degree, I\r\ngather, being related to bishops and other such personages. They go\r\nunder the unvarying title of the “British Army, First and Second\r\nBattalions.” According to report they were sent over here from England\r\nto do propaganda work, that is, to create a pleasant impression on young\r\nAmerica and thus help to forge another link between the two nations\r\netc., but this they indignantly deny. However that may be, the boys\r\nderive a rather wicked joy from teasing and arguing with the good\r\nladies, and particularly from filling them full of amazing tales about\r\n“The States.” Even the Secretary can’t resist the temptation to “rag”\r\nthem, and though they are usually very patient under his plaguing, today\r\nat dinner we received a shock. In response to one of his more daring\r\nsallies, the Bishop’s sister, fixing the Secretary with an icy eye,\r\nlifted one patrician hand to her august nose, and thumbed it! Which only\r\ngoes to show that even an English Lady of Quality has human moments. And\r\nif we on our side must laugh a bit at them, it is plain to see that\r\nthey, in their turn, find us infinitely amusing. In fact I half suspect,\r\nsince they spend hours every day covering sheets of paper with close,\r\nfine handwriting, that the good ladies are engaged upon writing a book\r\nconcerning the peculiarities of their American cousins when seen at\r\nclose range. And in view of all the wonderful material the boys have\r\nfurnished them, that book should make rich reading.\r\n\r\nThere are three Y.s here in a little triangle each a mile apart, all\r\nunder the same management; Jamy, Conflans and Labry. Within this\r\ntriangle, besides the ordnance detachment, there is a regiment of\r\nengineers, two companies of pioneer infantry, a telegraph battalion and\r\na detachment of negro labor troops.\r\n\r\nWhen the Americans came here last November, the town, they tell us, was\r\nan indescribable mess, the roads choked with abandoned military material\r\nand litter of all sorts. To the Americans as usual fell the pleasant\r\ntask of cleaning up. Sometimes I think that if France doesn’t come out\r\nof this war as clean as the classic Spotless Town it will only be\r\nbecause the Americans weren’t here long enough. And yet, funnily enough,\r\nFrance being cleaned up by America has often provided a spectacle\r\nanalogous to a little boy having his face washed against his will. At\r\nBourmont, when the Americans sought to make the town sanitary by a\r\nliberal use of disinfectants, a frantic protest went up from the\r\ninhabitants: their wells, they claimed, had all been ruined! At\r\nGondrecourt the Mayor presented a formal complaint; the Americans were\r\nwearing away the streets, he said, by too much cleaning! And on the\r\nother hand this sort of work proves none too pleasant a pill for\r\nAmerican pride to swallow. Today a young New York Jew came into the\r\ncanteen. He was a handsome fellow and in civilian life evidently\r\nsomething of a dandy. He belonged to the pioneers and he had been\r\nengaged all day, I gathered, in following about at the tail of a dump\r\ncart, picking up tin cans and rubbish.\r\n\r\n“My God!” he suddenly burst out. “If my wife could see me now! My God!\r\nif she could see me!”\r\n\r\nOne day last fall going down a street I passed a boy who was engaged in\r\na particularly dirty sort of cleaning. He looked up, caught my eye,\r\nstood grinning sheepishly at me a moment. Then he drawled, half\r\nhumourously, half-bitterly:\r\n\r\n“And my mother thinks I’m in the trenches!”\r\n\r\n\r\nConflans, March 10.\r\n\r\nAfter so many weeks of wandering, I have settled down to a job again.\r\nThe last six “huts” in which I have been were in a barracks, a casino, a\r\nprivate house, a convent, a college and a hospital. This “hut” is in a\r\nhotel. The hotel is situated directly back of the Conflans-Jamy railroad\r\nstation. Before the war the hotel was a prosperous and pleasant place,\r\njudging from the photograph which Madame showed us; its windows filled\r\nwith real lace curtains all matching! as she pointed out; the broad\r\nterrace in front on sunny days filled with little tables and crowded\r\nwith well-dressed people. Now, after four years of German occupation, it\r\nis a melancholy spectacle; ragged, dingy, half the panes gone from the\r\nwindows, its front painted over with staring German signs. There are two\r\nentrances, one into the hall leading to the rooms given over to the Y.\r\nthe other into what we call the “Annex,” a little café kept by Madame\r\nand Monsieur, the proprietors of the place. Next to our red triangle\r\nsign stares a board announcing brazenly in red and yellow _Vin et\r\nBière_; but the irony of the juxtaposition is quite lost on the French;\r\nindeed yesterday Madame asked me if I couldn’t get her the loan of a\r\ntruck to go to Nancy for a load of beer!\r\n\r\nMadame and Monsieur have been here all through the German occupation.\r\nThe Germans weren’t bad, Madame told me, if one were very meek and never\r\nsaid a word, but did just exactly as they said,—she had had some\r\ndifficulty to be sure, reducing her more temperish spouse to the proper\r\nattitude of meek submission!—but they had made a clean sweep of\r\neverything of value; all her linen that she had carefully hidden, her\r\ncopper utensils, everything.\r\n\r\nThe Y. consists of a canteen room, a reading and writing room,\r\nstore-room, kitchen and office. When I first saw the place it was as\r\nuninviting as anything could well be; dark, dirty, ill-smelling, the\r\nwalls covered with soiled ragged paper. But now it is very nice; the\r\ndirty cloth in the window frames has been replaced by vitex, the windows\r\nhung with pretty curtains, new electric lights have been added, and best\r\nof all, the walls entirely covered with German camouflage cloth and\r\ndecorated with bright posters. This camouflage cloth is a Godsend; woven\r\nof finely twisted strands of paper, it comes in three colors, a soft\r\nbrown, a yellowish green and a dark blue, resembling, when on the walls,\r\na loosely woven burlap. It was used by the Germans to conceal and\r\ndisguise military objects and was left here in large quantities when\r\nthey evacuated. The Americans hereabouts use it for every imaginable\r\npurpose; for covering unsightly walls, for curtains, for officers’ mess\r\ntable-cloths. Then there are the ammunition bags made of paper cloth\r\nwhich the boys use for laundry bags. “When in doubt, camouflage,” is the\r\nmotto. I chose brown for my canteen and now it is on the walls I feel\r\nthat no millionaire could ask for anything prettier. Only I wonder; will\r\nthey ask me to join the paper-hangers’ union when I get home?\r\n\r\nBesides running the dry canteen, we serve hot chocolate free every night\r\nfor all comers here, filling up their canteens so the boys can take it\r\naway with them, and run a free lodging-house. Every day we have boys\r\ncoming into the canteen asking for a bed. So after nine-fifteen we stack\r\nall the chairs and tables at one end of the writing-room, and bring out\r\ncanvas-cots and blankets from the store-room for our lodgers. There is\r\nonly one unfortunate feature of this scheme; the lodgers become so\r\nattached to their blankets that they are all too apt to carry them away\r\nwith them the next morning!\r\n\r\nA man secretary and I are to run the hut together; a minister in the\r\nstates, here he answers to the unvarying title of “Chief.” The “Chief” I\r\nfind at present chiefly remarkable for his trousers. These are garments\r\nwith a past apparently and a present of such a sort that in the company\r\nof ladies he is only rendered at ease by assuming a sitting posture. If\r\ncompelled to rise he backs out of your presence as if you were royalty\r\nor goes with the gesture of the little boy who has been chastised.\r\nOutside the house, no matter how fine the day may be, he goes discreetly\r\nclad in a raincoat.\r\n\r\n“I must,” declares the Chief at least six times a day, “go to Toul and\r\nget a new uniform.”\r\n\r\n“Amen,” say I under my breath.\r\n\r\nBesides the outfits stationed in town there are some twenty more in the\r\nneighborhood which draw their rations here at the railhead and then\r\nthere are the leave trains on their way to or from Germany, whose\r\npassing, like a visitation of locusts, leaves the canteen stripped and\r\nbare. The negro labor troops in the vicinity supply quite a new element.\r\nSometimes this takes the form of a bit of humour. Last night I had drawn\r\nseveral cups of cocoa ahead of the demand when a darky lad came shyly up\r\nto the counter and pointed to one.\r\n\r\n“Please ma’am,” he asked, “am dat cup occupied?”\r\n\r\nThere is one fat and genial little darky who is a constant customer,\r\nalways he comes in munching a sandwich or an orange or some other edible\r\nbought from a street-vendor.\r\n\r\n“Eating again, Jo?” asked the Chief today.\r\n\r\n“Why Boss,” expostulated Jo, “I only eats one meal a day! But dat,” he\r\ngrinned, “am all de time!”\r\n\r\n“Shines” the boys invariably call them.\r\n\r\nTonight we were amused to see a negro corporal, who, not content with\r\nthe chevrons on his sleeve, had sewed an additional pair on his overseas\r\ncap!\r\n\r\n\r\nConflans, March 14.\r\n\r\nMy family at the hut consists of the Chief, Harry, Jerry and Slim. Harry\r\nand Jerry are as nice lads as one could find anywhere, but Slim is the\r\nbird that hatched out of the cuckoo’s egg. Lean, uncouth, according to\r\nhis own claim, “the tallest man that Uncle Sam’s got in his army,” with\r\nan inordinately long neck and an Adam’s apple so prominent as to give\r\nhim the appearance of an ostrich in the act of swallowing a perpetual\r\norange, “Slim Old Horse” as the boys call him, seems to me at times more\r\nlike an animated caricature of the middle west “Long Boy” than a being\r\nof flesh and blood and bone. How he ever became attached to the Y. is a\r\npoint on which nobody seems certain, but here he is and here he sticks\r\nin spite of every effort to dislodge him. I fancy his “Top Kick” was\r\nonly too glad to get rid of him and when he discovered Slim’s\r\ninclination toward the Y. simply let him go and washed his hands of him.\r\nSlim’s health is uncertain. Most of the time he only feels well enough\r\nto sit in the office and eat or “chaw.”\r\n\r\n“I started in ter chaw terbaccer,”—he talks with a nasal twang which is\r\nimpossible to reproduce,—“when I was a kid four years old; when my daddy\r\nan’ my mammy found it out, they sure did start ter raise hell with me,\r\nbut I says to ’em; ‘All right, have it your way, but then it will be\r\nwhisky and rum fer mine, when I’m twenty-one!’ So my mammy says ‘Let ’im\r\nchaw.’ An’ I’ve chawed ever sence.”\r\n\r\n“I’ve only got one lung,” he remarked the other day, “and that’s a\r\nlittle one.”\r\n\r\n“Slim,” I urged, “I’m worried about you. You oughtn’t to be here. You\r\nought to be in the hospital where you could be properly cared for. Go to\r\nyour medical officer and tell him from me that he must send you to the\r\nhospital.”\r\n\r\nSlim reluctantly departed. I dared to hope we had seen the last of him.\r\nBut before the afternoon was over he was back on his old perch. He had\r\nbrought some little pills back with him. Just wait, I thought, until I\r\nmeet that medical officer!\r\n\r\nSlim seldom feels attracted to the meals at the mess-hall. So he sits in\r\nthe office and lives chiefly upon cheese, Y. M. C. A. cheese purchased\r\nto make sandwiches for the canteen at a cost of a dollar and a quarter a\r\npound. Sometimes he fries himself eggs, taking whatever mess-kit,\r\nHarry’s or Jerry’s or mine, happens to be handy and never, in spite of\r\nanything I can say, will he wash it up after him! Sometimes Harry and\r\nJerry and I decide that instead of going to mess we would like to have a\r\nsupper-party at the canteen ourselves, and then the question is, how to\r\nget rid of Slim?\r\n\r\n“Slim, it’s getting near chow-time,” we say, “I’ll bet they’re going to\r\nhave mashed potatoes and brown gravy tonight. Isn’t that ‘Soupy’ I hear\r\ngoing now?”\r\n\r\nBut Slim refuses to budge any more than a bump on a log, so we usually\r\nhave to end by inviting him. But if I find Slim a burden, how must the\r\nChief feel toward him? For Slim has appropriated the extra cot in the\r\noffice, which also serves as the Chief’s bed-room, and so has fairly\r\ncamped down on him. And the Chief is a gentleman of nerves and delicate\r\nperceptions.\r\n\r\n“He gets up in the middle of the night,” confided the Chief to me today\r\nin an almost awe-struck voice, “and he goes for the water-bucket and\r\ndrinks a half a pail without stopping. He makes a noise just like a\r\nhorse swallowing it.”\r\n\r\nI have given up trying to do anything with Slim. Nothing that I can say\r\nseems to make the least impression on him. Slim is a married man, yet\r\nyesterday I caught him embracing Louise, Madame’s cross-eyed maid of all\r\nwork, in the passage-way. I undertook to reprove him.\r\n\r\n“Why that ain’t nawthin!” he turned a blameless and unabashed eye upon\r\nme. “That’s jest a man’s nature.”\r\n\r\nThis is the first time that I have eaten regularly from a mess-kit and I\r\nam learning things. I have learned that the aluminum mess-cup draws the\r\nheat from the hot coffee so that it is impossible to drink out of one\r\nuntil the liquid has become half-way cold, and that it is most\r\nunappetizing to have to wash one’s mess-kit afterwards in a pail of\r\ngreasy soap suds in which a hundred odd other mess-kits have already\r\nbeen bathed. I used to tease the boys with their mess-cups in the\r\nchocolate line by telling them that I could tell just how recently they\r\nhad had inspection by the shine on their mess-cups, but now whenever I\r\nlook at the state of my own cup I think I won’t have the face to ever\r\ntease them that way again! I have also learned that cold “gold fish” or\r\n“sewer carp,” as the boys call their canned salmon, is just as bad as\r\nthey say it is, and that slum made of hunks of bacon, potatoes, onions\r\nand unlimited water is no easy thing to swallow. But this sounds\r\nungrateful and I don’t mean to be, for the cooks are nice as can be and\r\nnever say a word no matter how late I may be. While as for the boys,\r\nthey put on all their company manners for me.\r\n\r\nHere at the hut we are busy building an addition in order to enlarge our\r\nrestaurant business. This is in the shape of a room on the terrace. The\r\nGermans had kindly built a roof over one end, a detail from the ordnance\r\ndetachment at Jarny is enclosing the sides; we are to have three real\r\nglass windows looking out onto the street and a door connecting the\r\nterrace-room with the present canteen. This afternoon the detail ran out\r\nof lumber; the Chief managed to get the loan of a truck to fetch some\r\nmore. He asked Slim to go with the truck. The afternoon wore away,\r\nneither Slim nor the truck appeared, the detail, disgusted, sat and\r\ntwiddled their thumbs. Nobody could understand what had happened as the\r\nlumber yard was just around the corner! Jerry went out to search. There\r\nwas no trace of Slim or the truck to be found. About five o’clock he\r\nturned up. He had gone to Mars-la-Tour he told us coolly. We had been\r\ntalking of going to the commissary at Mars-la-Tour for canteen supplies,\r\nand that great goose had gotten into his head that the _lumber_ was to\r\nbe obtained there! At least that is his explanation. But Harry and Jerry\r\ninsinuate darker things:\r\n\r\n“We didn’t know you had a girl in Mars-la-Tour before,” they tease. “Oh\r\nSlim, you old devil, you!”\r\n\r\nI wonder now, just what _was_ he up to in Mars-la-Tour all afternoon?\r\n\r\n\r\nConflans, March 19.\r\n\r\nWhy is it that all the world loves a rascal? What is the secret of the\r\nfascination that outlaw and free-booter have exercised from Robin Hood\r\ndown to Captain Kidd? Is it because each one of us, in our secret\r\nhearts, would like to go and do likewise, if we only dared? Of all the\r\nminor piracies committed by the A. E. F. in France, none, I think, are\r\nso picturesque as those of the — Engineers.\r\n\r\nThe — Engineers are a railroad regiment. My first acquaintance with them\r\nwas last summer. A company of these engineers was located at a station\r\non the Paris line just north of us. It was a point at which supplies for\r\nthe American front were transferred from the standard gauge to the\r\nAmerican narrow gauge; in order to effect these transfers the —\r\nEngineers had a switch of their own. Now freight trains in France are\r\nquite unguarded and so at the mercy of marauders. Indeed the losses in\r\ntransit have been so serious that since the armistice it has been the\r\ncustom to have cars containing American goods “convoyed” to their\r\ndestination by soldier guards. Last summer of course the men could not\r\nbe spared for convoy duty. So it was the easiest thing in the world for\r\nthe — Engineers to “cut out” a Y. or a Red Cross car, side-track it, and\r\nlighten the load at their leisure.\r\n\r\n“I went through their company store-house while I was there,” a Q. M.\r\nsergeant told me, “and it was as well stocked with delicacies as the\r\nstore-rooms of a big hotel back in the States.”\r\n\r\nNo wonder there was such a dearth of supplies at Abainville last summer!\r\n\r\nBut it was after the — Engineers moved into the occupied area here\r\nfollowing the armistice that they performed their most notorious\r\nexploits. Assigned to run a stretch of railway in cooperation with the\r\nFrench, a certain amount of friction was inevitable from the start, the\r\nred tape in the French railway system exasperating the Americans as much\r\nas our more direct methods scandalized the French. Finally the French\r\nprotests at the Americans’ disregard for the formalities of railroading\r\nmoved the engineer officers to stricter discipline. “I’ll _hang_ the\r\nnext man of you who runs a train out of the yards without a pilot!”\r\ndeclared one captain. After that things went more smoothly,—on the\r\nsurface. Then came the Dance.\r\n\r\nNow unfortunately for the — Engineers there is an extra large M. P.\r\nforce here at Conflans under a Major whose greatest delight in life is\r\nthe detection and punishment of both major and minor infractions of the\r\nlaw.\r\n\r\nThe Dance was quite an affair over which the — Engineers had spread\r\nthemselves and to which the French fair sex was generally invited. When\r\nthe party was about to begin, however, it became evident that the\r\nfeminine partners afforded locally were all too few. Some bold soul had\r\na bright idea; a train-crew forthwith hurried down to the yards,\r\ncommandeered an engine and a couple of cars, and, in spite of the\r\nhorrified protests of the French railroad men, ran it to a nearby town.\r\nHere they filled up the train with girls from the village and were about\r\nto start back again when a detachment of M. P.s, rushed up in autos from\r\nConflans, broke in upon the scene. A sanguine scrimmage ensued,\r\nresulting in a victory for law and order.\r\n\r\nIn the meanwhile, back at the dance hall the engineers were waiting in\r\nimpatient expectation for partners. Among the invited guests were two\r\nfriendly M. P.s, old soldiers, with genial dispositions and several\r\nwound stripes to their credit. When word reached the party that the M.\r\nP.s had prevented the arrival of the “Mademoiselles” the engineers were\r\nfurious. “Kill the M. P.s!” went up the cry. Catching sight of the\r\nred-arm bands on their two innocent guests the crowd started for them\r\nwith the evident intention of making a beginning then and there. Heaven\r\nonly knows what would have happened if the two M. P.s, by affecting an\r\nexit at the double-quick, hadn’t immediately made their escape, unharmed\r\nbut badly scared.\r\n\r\nThe most notable exploit of the — Engineers occurred not long\r\nafterwards. It is referred to as the Affair of the Serge Uniforms. One\r\nfine day, not very long ago, it was noised abroad that a car full of\r\ntailored serge uniforms, consigned to and paid for by officers of the\r\nArmy of Occupation in Luxembourg, was standing down in the yards. The\r\nidea of going home in an officer’s serge uniform from which, of course,\r\nthe braid on the cuffs had been discreetly ripped, made a strong appeal\r\nto the boys’ imaginations. When the time came for that car to be sent to\r\nLuxembourg it was found to be quite empty. But for once the Engineers\r\nhad gone too far. The M. P. Major took the war-path. Word flew around\r\nthe camp that a strict search was being conducted. The possessors of the\r\nincriminating uniforms must get rid of them and get rid of them quick.\r\nSome hid them in out-of-the-way places, between the floors and ceilings\r\nin the half-ruined houses; others frantically ripped the uniforms to\r\npieces and burned them in the barracks stoves. The camp, they tell me,\r\nwas full of the stench of scorching woolen. Still others got rid of them\r\nby planting them among the possessions of their innocent neighbors. One\r\ncompany postal clerk, a most upright and blameless lad, to his horror\r\ndiscovered one of the fatal uniforms stuffed in a mail-bag lying at his\r\nfeet. Before the search party had made its rounds most of those serge\r\nuniforms had been safely disposed of; a few, a very few were found.\r\n\r\nBut now, having been baulked in his attempt to bring the culprits to\r\njustice, it is common rumour, that the M. P. Major is lying low, waiting\r\nto “fix” the — Engineers.\r\n\r\n\r\nConflans, March 23.\r\n\r\nThe — Engineers have left. They are on their way to Le Mans, presumably\r\nthe first stage of their journey home. Their departure was not unmarked\r\nby incident. At the last moment, when they had all entrained and were\r\nready to pull out of the station, the M. P. Major sallied forth,\r\ncourt-martials in his eye, to search the trains for contraband. But he\r\nhad reckoned without the Colonel of the engineers who flatly refused to\r\nallow any such procedure. Being outranked by the Colonel, the M. P.\r\nMajor was seemingly helpless. Then, however, the Colonel made a bad\r\nmistake. There were two train loads. The Colonel left with the first.\r\nThe second, being left without any protector of sufficiently high rank,\r\nfell an easy prey to the Major. He searched to his heart’s content,\r\ndiscovering several articles of unlawful loot and, one unfortunate clad\r\nin one of the notorious serge uniforms! The train was held in the yards\r\nwhile the M. P. Major indulged in an orgy of court-martials.\r\n\r\nOn the morning of the departure the captain of the motor unit where we\r\nhad messed stopped in to speak to me. He came by request of the boys to\r\nbring an apology for any careless language which might have been uttered\r\nunwittingly in my hearing! Then the captain of another unit called to\r\ntell us, sub rosa, that, forced by shortage of transportation, he was\r\nleaving behind an over supply of rations which would be ours for the\r\nfetching. We fetched accordingly and found that we had fallen heir to\r\ndozens of loaves of bread, sugar, coffee, canned meat, canned tomatoes,\r\nhard bread, soap and unlimited beans. What to do with these\r\nsurreptitious stores is now the embarrassing question. One simply can’t\r\noffer the boys hard bread, tomatoes plain or scalloped, in the canteen,\r\nno matter if one should dress them with all the sauces of Epicurus and\r\nserve them on gold-plate. Yet they mustn’t be wasted. What’s more, the\r\nfact that they are in our possession must be kept absolutely dark, lest\r\nwe get the kind captain into trouble. I feel something like the man who\r\nwas presented with a million dollar check and then found he couldn’t\r\ncash it.\r\n\r\nWith the — Engineers went Harry, Jerry, and Slim. I couldn’t believe\r\nuntil the last moment that Slim was actually going. His departure almost\r\ncompensated for the loss of Harry and Jerry. But though gone, he is not\r\nforgotten. This morning a lad came into the canteen. He would like his\r\nwatch please, he said. I looked blankly at him. He explained; several\r\ndays ago, just as he was leaving on a long truck-trip, he had broken the\r\nstrap of his wrist watch. Happening to be in front of the Y. just then,\r\nhe had brought it in and left it for safe-keeping “with the Y. man in\r\nthe office.” The Chief knew nothing of it.\r\n\r\n“What did the Y. man look like?” I questioned.\r\n\r\nHe described him. It was Slim. We have searched every nook and cranny of\r\nthat office, hoping to come upon the missing watch, in vain.\r\n\r\n“I’ll come in again,” said the boy. “Perhaps by that time you will have\r\nfound it.”\r\n\r\nBut personally I am sure that that watch is now on its way to Le Mans,\r\nen route for the States. Was there ever anything more wretchedly\r\nembarrassing?\r\n\r\n\r\nConflans, March 27.\r\n\r\nThis is a curious world. Six “Relief Trains” pass through here every day\r\nbound east, loaded with food for Germany. Meanwhile in the little\r\nhalf-ruined hamlets within a stone’s throw of the tracks the French\r\nvillagers, for whom no provision has been made, are famine-stricken.\r\n\r\nLieutenant A. came in from the little town of Pierrefond which lies\r\nbetween Conflans and Verdun yesterday.\r\n\r\n“They have nothing to eat there,” he told me, “but the weeds they dig up\r\nin the fields for _salade_ and the frogs they catch in the marshes. When\r\nthe days are cold the frogs bury themselves so deep in the mud that they\r\ncan’t be caught. There is one old gentleman who told me today that he\r\nhad existed for weeks entirely on a diet of turnips. They come to me and\r\nbeg pitifully for a bite of something from the mess-kitchen, but I don’t\r\ndare let them have it, as that would be, of course, strictly against\r\nregulations.”\r\n\r\nI thought of those bushels of beans in the store-house. It was taking a\r\nchance of course, because after all it was government property and\r\nnothing else, but I told the Lieutenant that if he was willing to run\r\nthe risk, I was; then I put it up to the Chief.\r\n\r\nThis morning the Lieutenant came in with a flivver. We drove over to the\r\nstore-house and loaded it up with army beans, issue coffee, sugar, rice,\r\nonions, potatoes and soap. Then we filled a special sack with canned\r\nsoup, “gold fish,” corn meal, canned tomatoes and corn syrup for the old\r\ngentleman who had lived on turnips. I felt he had a special claim on our\r\nsympathy.\r\n\r\nWe reached Pierrefond after a long drive in a stinging rain. It was a\r\nquaint pathetic village with a pretty little church whose tower had been\r\nsliced off as neatly as by a knife. Was it a German or a French shell\r\nwhich had done it, I wondered. We drew up in front of the Mayor’s house.\r\nHe came out to greet us, showed me a list of the seventy-three\r\ninhabitants of the town; men, women and infants in arms. All the\r\nsupplies were to be duly weighed and measured and distributed, so much\r\nper capita. While they were unloading the flivver we stopped in at\r\nMadame C.’s for coffee and compliments, and to dry out by her hospitable\r\nfire. Everyone made pretty speeches, of course, and Madame bestowed on\r\nme a delectable bouquet of wall-flowers and daffodils. Poor things! It’s\r\nlittle enough one can do for them. This will keep the wolf from the door\r\nfor a short while perhaps, but after that, what then?\r\n\r\nPierrefond, like Conflans, was occupied by the Germans for four years.\r\nNow there is a young half-German population growing up, even as many as\r\nthree to one family. The villagers accept the situation with tolerant\r\nhumour; “Souvenirs Boches,” they call the children.\r\n\r\nAs for the rest of the rations, I made jam sandwiches with the bread and\r\nbestowed them together with hot chocolate on a hungry leave train. What\r\nto do with the “Charlie Horse,” as the boys call the canned roast beef,\r\nwas a puzzle. Finally I made a paste of it mixed with bread crumbs,\r\ntomato soup, a few weenies and some ham scraps, pickles, parsley, onion\r\nand an egg,—we had six assistants in the kitchen and each added an\r\ningredient,—put it between slices of bread and christened the result\r\n“Liberty Sandwiches. Guaranteed to contain neither Gold Fish nor Corn\r\nWilly.” The boys ate and wondered and came back for more.\r\n\r\n\r\nConflans, March 30.\r\n\r\nIn our back yard a detail of German prisoners is busy cleaning up;\r\nalready they have made quite a transformation. Madame must have a\r\ngarden. I wonder, as I watch them, what their state of mind may be;\r\ntheir phlegmatic faces give no hint. Did some of these very ones,\r\nperhaps, make merry in this self same café, only six months ago, when\r\nthey were conquerors?\r\n\r\nMadame tells me how, when the German officers were living here at the\r\nhotel, they ate off priceless old French plates, which, apparently quite\r\nignorant of their value, they had carried off as loot. Madame, coveting\r\nthese treasures, tried to arrange an exchange with the mess orderly,\r\noffering a number of modern dishes in return for one antique; but the\r\nmess orderly, fearing that some officer might notice the substitution,\r\nhesitated and before they could come to an agreement the precious\r\nplates, with the rough handling accorded them, had all been broken to\r\nbits.\r\n\r\nSome of the boys seem to think that the French don’t give their\r\nprisoners enough to eat. The Germans, they say, when they get the\r\nchance, will wait outside the mess-hall door and seize eagerly the\r\nleavings in the mess-kits that the boys are about to throw away.\r\n\r\n“Maybe it’s just because they’re greedy,” I say. “Surely they look fat\r\nenough!” And then a picture comes back to my mind, the picture of a Red\r\nCross train seen while waiting at Pagny on my way to Paris last January,\r\na train full of French prisoners who were being brought back from\r\nGermany, so weak from starvation that they lay on stretchers or sat\r\npressing against the windows faces as wan and white as spectres.\r\n\r\nThe German prisoners, according to the boys’ repeated stories, are by no\r\nmeans a humble or repentant lot. They’re not beaten for good, the\r\nprisoners invariably declare. Just as soon as the Americans have gone\r\nand things have calmed down a bit, they are coming back to France again,\r\nthey say, and this time they will settle matters with the French for\r\ngood and all!\r\n\r\nLast night a train load of German prisoners in box cars pulled into\r\ntown. When the doors of the cars were opened it was found that one of\r\nthe prisoners had died on the way. The dead man was wrapped in a blanket\r\nand left lying on the freight station platform. A “shine” from the labor\r\nbattalion happened along in the dark, tripped and fell flat over the\r\nbody. He came into the canteen in a state of nerves, quite prepared,\r\nevidently, to see a ghost in every corner.\r\n\r\n\r\nConflans, April 2.\r\n\r\nThe latest member of our household is something quite new in the way of\r\ndetails. He is a Salvation Army man and a very nice fellow indeed. A\r\nyear or so ago he was beating a big drum in front of Gimbel’s Store;\r\nthen he was drafted to come to France with the pioneers; now he has\r\napplied for a discharge in order to join his organization over here; and\r\nwhile waiting for his release he is proving himself an invaluable aid in\r\nthe canteen. Now more than ever, since The Salvation Army, as everybody\r\ncalls him, has joined our force, I have been longing to realize a dream\r\nwhich I have cherished ever since I came to France,—to make doughnuts\r\nfor the A. E. F. I have the recipe, I can get the materials, the stove\r\nis the sticking-point. At present our cooking equipment consists of a\r\nhot water boiler and a wretched German range which is really fit for\r\nnothing but the scrap-heap. As the boys say, I have lost more religion\r\nthan I ever thought I had over that stove! So while we hope and hunt for\r\na doughnut-stove we are specializing in sandwiches and puddings. The\r\npuddings are my special pride as I worked out the ideas for them myself\r\nand, as far as I know, they are served in no other canteen. There are\r\nfour of them; Coffee Jelly, Raspberry Jelly (made with the\r\n“pink-lemonade” fruit juice) Chocolate Bread Pudding, and Blackberry\r\nBread Pudding. The bread-puddings are baked for us, by kindness of the\r\ncooks, at a nearby mess-kitchen. The only trouble with the puddings is,\r\nthat there never is enough! But lest anyone should think that I take\r\nthis as a compliment to my culinary skill, I must explain that the boys\r\nwould eat anything you offered them, I believe, just as long as it was\r\nsweet and was a change. And then there is perhaps a quaint psychological\r\nfactor too.\r\n\r\n“A man don’t like to eat food that’s cooked by a man,” a lad confided to\r\nme the other day. “Anything that’s cooked by a woman tastes better.”\r\n\r\nSo if a boy does leave any scraps of pudding on his plate it bothers me\r\nunreasonably.\r\n\r\n“Somebody didn’t like his pudding,” I remark mournfully to the S. A. as\r\nI pick up the dishes. This amuses him. Last night as we were clearing up\r\nbefore we closed he marched up to the counter, deposited a tiny wad\r\nfound on one of the tables in front of me.\r\n\r\n“Somebody,” he declared in a tragic tone, “didn’t like his chewing-gum!”\r\n\r\nNor can I boast, as a cook, of a record of unvarying success. On more\r\nthan one occasion I must admit to having scorched the cocoa, and once,\r\nnot many days ago—to my shame be it said!—I ruined a ten gallon can by\r\nputting in salt instead of sugar!\r\n\r\nHere at Conflans we have an unusual amount of competition in the light\r\nlunch line. The other day a French fried potato booth, like a hot-dog\r\nbooth at a country fair at home, established itself on the terrace just\r\noutside our door. Now a hungry doughboy can take the edge off his\r\nappetite with a paper full of hot French fries in return for a franc at\r\nany hour of the day.\r\n\r\nAlso in the street below the terrace are many little stands where\r\noranges and sandwiches made of rolls and slices of sausage are on sale.\r\nThe rivalry between these stands, it appears, is acute. Yesterday,\r\nhearing a hubbub, I looked out to see a comic battle in progress, the\r\nproprietors of two neighboring stands, a fat frowsy old woman and a\r\nlittle ragged man like a weasel, pelting each other for all they were\r\nworth with rotten oranges while half the A. E. F., it seemed, stood\r\naround and cheered. Nor did matters settle down to calm until a gendarme\r\nand intervention appeared on the scene.\r\n\r\nThis morning I stopped in at the little French store around the corner\r\nto buy half a dozen eggs to make a custard sauce for my chocolate bread\r\npudding. When the man gave me my change I noticed he had overcharged me\r\nby twenty-five centimes.\r\n\r\n“Why’s that?” I asked.\r\n\r\n“That,” returned the shopkeeper, “is because you picked them out by\r\nhand.”\r\n\r\nSome canteen ladies can cook and wait on the counter and open milk-cans\r\nand wash the chocolate cups and yet keep spotlessly and specklessly\r\nclean. But I have come to the conclusion that as long as I live in\r\nConflans, with its air full of smoke and soot from the train yards, and\r\nits water so hard that it curdles the soap,—and sometimes the milk in\r\nthe cocoa too, that I will have to content myself with being godly and\r\nleave the cleanliness till a happier day. We have been having a regular\r\nplague of inspectors and investigators of late. Last night just as I had\r\nmy final bout with the last chocolate container, a major and a\r\nlieutenant colonel wandered in, evidently in search of scandal. The\r\nlieutenant colonel fixed a piercing eye on me.\r\n\r\n“So you are the only ‘white woman’ in this part of the world at\r\npresent?”\r\n\r\n“Well,” I said looking at my fingers smudged with cocoa, “tonight I\r\nshould say that I was a pale chocolate-colored woman.”\r\n\r\n“I noticed that your face was dirty,” coolly returned the gentleman. I\r\nhurriedly excused myself in order to consult a looking-glass. Sure\r\nenough, there on my nose was a large smudge of soot! I must have got it\r\nthe last time I stoked the chocolate-stove.\r\n\r\n\r\nConflans, April 7.\r\n\r\nThe M. P.s live in the hotel next door. Naturally we see a good deal of\r\nthem. I try to treat them extra nicely because I feel sorry for them.\r\nThey can’t help being M. P.s any more than they can help being\r\nunpopular. And though many of them go about with a chip on their\r\nshoulders and an attitude of I-don’t-give-a-tinker’s-damn, still to know\r\nthat you are anathema to the major portion of the A. E. F., to be\r\npublicly referred to as Misery Providers, Mademoiselle Promenades, and\r\nMilitary Pests, besides being made the subject of songs such as; _Mother\r\ntake down your service flag, Your son is only an M. P._, must be galling\r\nto the most insensitive.\r\n\r\nJust as soon as the armistice was signed the doughboys started in to\r\npester the M. P.s with the classic taunt:\r\n\r\n“Who won the war?—The M. P.s!”\r\n\r\nFor a long while the M. P.s could think of no more crushing rejoinder\r\nthan the time-honored;\r\n\r\n“Aw, go to hell!”\r\n\r\nBut lately some bright soul has hit upon a bit of repartee that goes far\r\nto salve the M. P.s’ self-respect. Now if a soldier is so rash as to\r\njeer; “Who won the war? The M. P.s!” the response comes instantly:\r\n\r\n“Yep! They chased the doughboys up front!”\r\n\r\nThere are two M. P.s from the detachment next door who have lately\r\njoined themselves to our family. Like Slim, they came unsolicited, and\r\nlike Slim, they stick. They are known respectively as the Littlest M. P.\r\nand the Fattest M. P.\r\n\r\nThe Littlest M. P. is a pest. I feel sorry for him because he is so\r\nyoung and has no mother; otherwise there would be no tolerating him. He\r\nhangs about the canteen from morning until late at night under pretence\r\nof assisting us, and eats and eats and eats and eats. The other day I\r\nheard him proudly averring that he hadn’t taken a meal in the mess-hall\r\nfor two weeks, and I believed him. Yet when you ask him to do any\r\nparticular piece of work, like filling up the wood box or fetching a\r\npail of water, in return for his board, he always has some perfectly\r\ngood reason for not doing it. Besides which, he has no morals. The other\r\nday he confided to me triumphantly that the reason that they didn’t put\r\nhim on guard work was that they knew he would take money to let men into\r\ncafés at prohibited hours. He went on to tell me about the town of S.\r\n\r\n“That was a good place, you could get twenty-five francs for lettin’ a\r\nfeller into a café out of hours there.”\r\n\r\nI have tried to find out what he does in return for Uncle Sam’s dollar a\r\nday and have discovered that his job is sweeping out the halls in the M.\r\nP. Hotel.\r\n\r\n“But I skip about twenty feet at each end every time, so it don’t take\r\nme more’n ten minutes.”\r\n\r\nYesterday morning he came in with an air of righteousness rewarded.\r\n\r\n“I told ’em I’d got to have help on that job,” he announced, “so they\r\nput another feller on too.”\r\n\r\nThis morning I got so exasperated with him that I told him in\r\nunmistakable terms that we could dispense with his company. He\r\ndisappeared, and I congratulated myself that we were rid of him. But at\r\nsupper-time he bobbed serenely up again.\r\n\r\n“Some fellers would have got sore if you’d spoke like that to them,” he\r\ntold me with a magnanimous air, “but I just took it as a joke.”\r\n\r\nNow what is one to do with anybody like that?\r\n\r\nThe Fattest M. P. is the most unleavened lump of good-nature I have ever\r\nknown. He is, I understand, a notorious poker-player and his breath, to\r\nmy embarrassment, betrays the fact that he has a weakness for Conflans\r\nbeer. Besides which, he really takes up quite too much room behind the\r\ncounter. Yet in spite of all this, he is such a simple soul and is so\r\nanxious to help that one hasn’t the heart to send him away.\r\n\r\nYesterday I thought I was going to be arrested by an M. P. I had gone\r\nover to Verdun in an army flivver to get some stock. Turning the corner\r\ninto Conflans on our way home we were halted by the upraised billy of\r\nthe M. P. on duty.\r\n\r\n“Sorry, Buddy!” he called to the driver, “but you can’t do that!”\r\n\r\nThen, approaching, he got a closer view, turned red as fire and\r\nstammered;\r\n\r\n“Beg your pardon, Miss. Made a mistake. That’s all right, driver, you\r\ncan go on.”\r\n\r\nLater he sent apologies to me at the canteen. It is, of course, against\r\nregulations to allow civilian women to use army transportation. The M.\r\nP., catching sight of a skirt, had taken me for a Mademoiselle on a\r\njoy-ride.\r\n\r\n\r\nConflans, April 7.\r\n\r\nWe must start an Orphans’ Annex here, the boys tell me. Three nights ago\r\nas it was drawing on toward closing time the Chief called me into the\r\noffice. By the table stood two young boys, about fourteen and sixteen I\r\njudged them; each carried on his shoulder a little sack which evidently\r\ncontained all his worldly possessions. They were German boys from Metz;\r\nthey had just come in on the train. Why had they come? we asked them.\r\nThey had come to join the American army. But they were too young! He was\r\neighteen, declared the elder. He dug into his pockets and produced\r\ndocuments. I looked at two of the papers, they appeared to be the birth\r\ncertificates of his father and mother. Had his parents given their\r\nconsent? He nodded. “And you really are eighteen?”, “_Ja! Ja wohl!_” It\r\nwas hard to believe,—he was so small. We stared at them a bit\r\nhelplessly. Then, finding our German not quite adequate to the occasion,\r\nwe called an interpreter. But to all the interpreter’s questioning the\r\nboy returned the same unvarying answer. He had come to join the American\r\narmy! As for the younger one, he merely stood and smiled and looked as\r\nguileless as a young angel. Whatever the elder one’s intention might be,\r\nI was sure I could divine the younger’s. _He_, I am certain, had set his\r\nheart on being an American “mascot.” And he, for all his innocent and\r\nengaging air, had most patently run away from home!\r\n\r\nWe told the boys that we would put them up for the night. I busied\r\nmyself in getting them some supper and then—another waif appeared! A\r\nlittle French lad of thirteen, with a peg-leg and a crutch, he came\r\nshyly hobbling into the office, and the face he lifted to us was one of\r\nthe sweetest, the most sensitive and appealing that I have ever seen.\r\nSilently he tendered us a letter. It had been written by an American\r\nlieutenant; the bearer, it stated, was an orphan of the war; he had been\r\nshot by German machine-gunners near Verdun; his right leg had been\r\namputated at the thigh. I looked at the crippled child in apprehension.\r\nHow would he take the presence of the Germans? But my question was\r\nalready answered. The little German lad and the French _mutilé_ had\r\ndrawn close together, seemingly drawn instantly to each other by a bond\r\nof childish understanding. Although neither could speak the other’s\r\nspeech they appeared to be communicating in some shy wordless way.\r\nLater, as we were getting the cots ready for the lodgers, passing the\r\nempty canteen room, I glanced inside. Somebody had started the victrola\r\non the counter to playing a waltz, and to its music the German boys were\r\ndancing while the little French lad gaily kept time with his crutch!\r\n\r\nWe fed the three of them and put them up for the night. The next morning\r\nthe French lad took his leave. Later he came back to see us dressed in a\r\nlittle American uniform; he had been adopted by one of the companies\r\nhere. The German lads stayed with us, or rather, they slept and ate with\r\nthe M. P.s next door and spent the rest of the day with us in the\r\ncanteen. They loved to help about the counter; they were quick and deft\r\nand willing. The only trouble with the arrangement was that I fairly\r\nwent distracted trying to talk three languages at once!\r\n\r\nTwo days afterwards, the M. P.s having taken the matter in hand, the\r\nGerman boys were sent back to Metz. But the French lad comes in often to\r\nvisit us. We see him playing ball with the soldiers in the street in\r\nfront of the hotel. This morning the S. A. and I stood watching him.\r\n\r\n“I wouldn’t mind it so much somehow,” the S. A. remarked, “if he didn’t\r\nhave that wrap-legging wound so tight around that pitiful little\r\npeg-stick!”\r\n\r\nThe tenderness toward little children which the war has shown forth so\r\nvividly has been a revelation of an inherent sweetness in the boys’\r\nnatures; this fondness for children other than their own, being, I\r\nbelieve a distinctive characteristic of our American men. Any number of\r\ncompanies have mascots, little French boys, orphans usually, whom they\r\ndress in miniature uniforms, take about from place to place with them,\r\nand, of course, spoil quite shamelessly. And in every unit that\r\npossesses a mascot you find boys whose dearest wish is to adopt the\r\nlittle fellow as his own and take him back home; but this the French law\r\nforbids.\r\n\r\n“That’s the best part of France, the little kids,” remarked a boy to me\r\nas we passed a group of little tots by the roadside.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately though, this petting has another side. Spoiled by the\r\nsoft-hearted soldiers, the French gamins have developed into a brood of\r\nbrazen little beggars. They have come to regard all Americans, it seems,\r\nas perambulating slot machines for “goom” and chocolate with whom,\r\nhowever, the purchasing penny is quite superfluous. I shall never forget\r\nbeing held up, as I was walking with a doughboy through the streets of\r\nLourdes, by a tiny lad who demanded pathetically;\r\n\r\n“_Une cigarette pour moi, et une pour Papa, et une pour Maman qui est\r\nmalade!_”\r\n\r\nNor the fifteen year old conductor on a suburban tram line near Paris,\r\nwho took up our tickets with a forbidding scowl, and then, his rounds\r\nmade, hurried back down the car to confront us with the wistful childish\r\nplea: “’Ave you goom?”\r\n\r\nFor some while there has been a red-headed urchin of perhaps thirteen\r\nyears hanging about the hut. As he was dressed in an O. D. blouse,\r\nbreeches and leggings, I concluded that he was somebody’s mascot. He\r\nkept coming into the canteen to buy gum and cigarettes; presently I\r\ndiscovered he was purchaser for a little gang of ragamuffins who would\r\nwait for him just outside the door. I asked the boys in the canteen if\r\nthey knew anything about the red-head, but no one seemed to know who he\r\nwas or to what outfit he belonged. The boy himself seemed stupid and\r\nsullen when I questioned him. Finally I told him that I could sell him\r\nnothing more. Tonight my friend the M. P. Sergeant asked casually;\r\n\r\n“Do you remember that red-headed kid that used to hang around? Well\r\nwe’ve got him and eight others.”\r\n\r\n“Why, what for?”\r\n\r\n“They’re Propaganda Kids. They came over here from Germany; they’ve been\r\nstealing American uniforms and smuggling them to the German prisoners so\r\nthey could escape in them.”\r\n\r\n\r\nConflans, April 15.\r\n\r\nOf all the roads over which I have ever passed, the road from Conflans\r\nto Verdun will remain, I think, most sharply etched upon my memory.\r\n\r\nLeaving Conflans, as one passes through the occupied territory, the\r\npredominant impression made upon one’s mind is of signs. German military\r\nsigns. These are everywhere, painted in great staring letters on the\r\nsides of buildings, covering bill-boards set at the road’s edge, or hung\r\nsuspended from the branches of trees over the truck drivers’ heads. Here\r\nin this German sector behind the lines every movement was timed, ordered\r\nand regulated. No one could possibly go astray, no one could lose a\r\nmoment in hesitation as to where he should go, in what manner and at\r\nwhat rate. Half-way between Conflans and the lines you come upon two\r\ngreat bill-boards at the highway’s edge, one duplicating the other, in\r\norder that, marching past, what might have been missed on the first\r\nboard, could be supplied by the second. They are headed “Under Enemy\r\nObservation!” and give in strict detail the order of procedure from that\r\npoint forward, both by day and night, just what strength the marching\r\ngroups should be and how many metres should intervene between them. The\r\nGerman thoroughness, the German system! Everything has been thought of,\r\neverything provided for, everything possible done to reduce the\r\nindividual to an automaton, a mere senseless cog in a vast machine. And\r\nyet among all these signs there is one that lacks, a sign that is\r\nnotable by its absence; it is the sign that should read _Nach Verdun_.\r\n\r\nOnce across the lines on the French side you are struck by the startling\r\ndifference; here the only signs that one sees are two, poignant in their\r\nsimplicity and directness. They are _Poste de Secours_ and _Blessés à\r\nPied_.\r\n\r\nEvery time I approach Verdun by this road I thrill when I think of the\r\nenormous energy that poured along it, directed, it must have seemed,\r\nirresistibly, over-poweringly against the city in the hills; a thrill\r\nonly surpassed by the emotion that one must feel when he traverses the\r\n_Sacra Via_ on the other side of Verdun, the “Holy Way” over which men\r\nand munitions flowed incessantly to the defense of the beleaguered city.\r\n\r\nEverywhere one sees the ineffaceable scars of struggle, the aftermath of\r\ndestruction. The stately trees bordering the roadside, the trees that\r\nNapoleon ordered planted along the highways of France, are barked with\r\ngreat ugly gashes where mines had been placed, the exploding of which\r\nwould have felled the great trees across the road, blocking the\r\npursuer’s way. Others bear platforms high up in the branches where\r\nmachine-guns were placed. Rotting camouflages of every sort, paper\r\nstrips woven like lattice, curtains of branches woven through wire which\r\nonce screened the road for miles from the enemy’s observation, now lie\r\ndisintegrating in the ditches. Shell holes pit the fields, concrete\r\n“pill-boxes” lurk in unsuspected places, every mound is shelter for a\r\ndugout, walls are riddled with ragged holes cut for machine-guns.\r\nFurther on, one comes to the trenches zigzagging in what seems erratic\r\nand aimless patterns and the interminable barbed-wire entanglements,\r\nlike the devil’s brier patches.\r\n\r\nHalf across the open plain that lies before the hills of Verdun you come\r\nupon a German tank defence, a long line of heavy concrete pillars with\r\nenormous cables, once highly electrified, looped between. A little\r\nfarther and the road crosses an impromptu bridge thrown hastily over the\r\ngreat gaping crater torn by an exploding mine. And always here and there\r\nover the plain, little heaps of glimmering whitish stones which mark the\r\nplaces where once were villages. Starting to ascend the hills, one looks\r\ndown upon a ghost city, a city where many of the walls still stand,\r\nmaking you think of nothing but a huddled host of tombstones, a city\r\nchalk-white, naked, as if the flesh were all picked away from its dead\r\nbones; the most haunted, the most wraith-like, the most desolate of any.\r\n\r\nClimbing the hills, sweeping around one slow curve after another, one\r\nbeholds suddenly before him, a lesser hill ringed by higher ones,\r\nVerdun, scarred, wounded, but victorious, like the Winged Victory of\r\nSamothrace, mutilated yet triumphant!\r\n\r\nWhen I first made the trip from Verdun to Conflans there were still good\r\npickings for the souvenir-hunter by the way; shell-cases, helmets, gas\r\nmasks lying along the roadside; but lately it has looked as if these\r\ntrophies had been thoroughly gleaned. Nor does one wonder where they\r\nhave gone when one sees the flivvers piled high with homeward bound\r\nsouvenirs pulling in at the post office around the corner. But will they\r\nreach home, is the question? Ominous rumours are abroad that salvage\r\nplants have been established at the base ports for the particular\r\npurpose of confiscating shell-cases on their way to America, and thereby\r\nsaving the Allies a fortune in brass. Some of the boys are inclined to\r\ntry to carry their trophies with them rather than entrust them to Uncle\r\nSam’s mail service, but this entails some trouble to prevent their\r\nseizure during inspections. Nowadays, passing by, one can tell when an\r\ninspection is in progress within, by all the junk which is hanging out\r\nof the barracks windows! Homeward-bound troops have already discovered a\r\nuse for gas masks not mentioned in the Drill Manual: the cases provide\r\nan excellent receptacle in which surreptitiously one may carry\r\nphotographs and post-cards! When I first came to Conflans, camouflaged\r\nGerman helmets were a prize so rare as to be much sought after by the\r\nsouvenir enthusiast; but now camouflaged helmets may be had for the\r\nasking; an enterprising bugler possessed of a knack with a paint-brush\r\nhas gone into the business of camouflaging them while you wait.\r\n\r\nYesterday, after having returned from Verdun, I noticed a post-card in a\r\nJarny shop. It showed a black cat and a white cat silhouetted against\r\nthe moon, perched on the skeleton beams of a half-demolished house,\r\npeering disconsolately about them. Underneath the sentence ran; _Où\r\nest-il le toit de nos amours?_ Where is the roof of our love? Could any\r\nnation but the French thus make light of such tragedy?\r\n\r\n\r\nParis, April 21.\r\n\r\nI am on my way home at last. I am waiting here for my sailing. This time\r\nI am really going all the way through. Now that I am on the brink of the\r\n_retour au civil_, as the French say, it seems very odd. For eighteen\r\nmonths I haven’t worn white gloves, or silk stockings, or a veil, no,\r\nnor even powdered my nose. And the worst of it is, these things don’t\r\nseem to matter any more. Even a uniform, and a homely uniform at that,\r\nhas tremendous advantages as part of a working scheme of life. As one\r\ngirl remarked;\r\n\r\n“You don’t have to spend any time thinking: Shall I put on the pink or\r\nthe blue tonight? The only question is, Do I or do I not need a clean\r\ncollar?”\r\n\r\nSomehow I feel a little unfitted to go back to a civilian existence once\r\nmore. The same feeling one finds expressed continually among the boys.\r\n\r\n“When I get back home, if I see a line anywhere I’ll go and stand in it\r\njust from force of habit,” remarked one boy, grinning ruefully.\r\n\r\nBut most often this feeling takes the form of a pathetic and wistful\r\nfear.\r\n\r\n“I’m afraid I’ll shock Mother when I get home.”\r\n\r\n“They won’t know what to make of us, back home, the way we’ll behave.”\r\n\r\n“I reckon I’ve forgotten how to act civilized.”\r\n\r\nAnd over and again they confess to a shame-faced apprehension lest they\r\nshould unguardedly relapse into the language of the army and so frighten\r\ntheir women folk!\r\n\r\nA famous French surgeon confided to my friend, the English Lady:\r\n\r\n“In that first year of the war when we were allowed no _permissions_ we\r\nbecame like savages. The first time that I returned home I was afraid. I\r\nwas afraid all the while, afraid before my wife, before my\r\nchildren,—afraid that I would act the beast.”\r\n\r\nIf by coming to France, we women who have had this privilege have\r\ndiscovered the American doughboy, the American doughboy, by coming to\r\nFrance, has discovered America. I don’t know who first said; “After I\r\nget back, if the Statue of Liberty ever wants to see my face again,\r\nshe’ll have to turn around,” but whoever did, uttered a sentiment which\r\nhas been echoed and re-echoed all over France. The doughboy has been to\r\nParis, “the City of Light,” he has amused himself in the playgrounds of\r\nprinces along the Riviera, he has visited the châteaux and palaces of\r\nkings and queens. And though he admits it is all mighty fine, in the\r\nface of everything he holds staunchly to his declaration of loyalty;\r\n“I’ll tell the world the little old U. S. A. is good enough for me!”\r\n\r\nAt times perhaps his patriotic enthusiasm has outweighed his manners.\r\nAgain and again a French villager, evidently echoing some doughboy’s\r\ndissertation, has asked me a little wistfully;\r\n\r\n“America _bon_, goode! France _pas bon_, no goode! _Hein?_”\r\n\r\n“Anyway the war has done one good thing,” I used to say to the lads in\r\nthe canteens, “it has taught you to appreciate your homes.”\r\n\r\n“I used to want to get away from home,” confided one boy to me, “but\r\nwhen I get back there again I’m just going to tie myself so tight to\r\nMother’s apron-strings that she’ll never get the knot undone.”\r\n\r\n“Say, when I get back,” declared another lad as he helped me wipe the\r\ndishes, “my mother’s going to find I’m just the best little K. P. she\r\never knew.”\r\n\r\n“When I get home, I’m going to lock myself in the house and then I’m\r\ngoing to lose the key and stay right there for a month,” announced\r\nanother.\r\n\r\n“Who’s in your house?”\r\n\r\n“Just Mother. She’s good enough for me.”\r\n\r\nSometimes I have thought that three things have stood as concrete\r\nsymbols of all that was desirable to the American boy through his ordeal\r\nover here: a dollar-bill, the Statue of Liberty, his mother’s face. And\r\nonly a shade less touching than the doughboy’s realization of all that\r\nis implied by “Mother;” is his attitude of chivalrous idealism toward\r\nthe American girl. Once I ventured to say something in praise of the\r\nwomen of France.\r\n\r\n“But they’re not as fine as our girls!” came the instant jealous\r\nrejoinder.\r\n\r\n“No _Mademoiselles françaises_ for me, thank you. I’ve got a little girl\r\nof my own back home!”\r\n\r\n“Our American girls, they’re as different from these French girls,”\r\ndeclared a tall Virginian, “as day is from night!”\r\n\r\n“I’ve laid off of lovin’ while I’ve been over here,” confided one little\r\nengineer, “but, oh boy! my girl’s goin’ to get an awful huggin’ when I\r\nget home!”\r\n\r\nThe most pitiful and hopeless cases that I have seen over here were boys\r\nwho had taken to drink because their girls at home had proved\r\ninconstant. “That man never touched a drop,” confided the buddy of one\r\nof these to me, “until he got that letter from his girl telling him that\r\nshe was married to a slacker.”\r\n\r\nNot that the doughboy’s conduct has always been above reproach. “Single\r\nmen in barracks,” as Kipling once remarked, “don’t grow into plaster\r\nsaints;” and he has been sorely tempted. But in his heart he has kept an\r\nideal. It has stood between him and utter darkness. In this ideal he has\r\nput all his faith. If he loses it, he loses everything. Those women back\r\nhome, I wonder, do they really understand?",
