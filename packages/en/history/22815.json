Fisher Unwin\r\n                          1, Adelphi Terrace.\r\n                                 MCMVI\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPrinted and bound by Hazell, Watson and Viney, LD., London and\r\nAylesbury.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPreface to the First Edition\r\n\r\n\r\nIt would be surprising if the concerns of an interesting Colony\r\nlike the _Philippine Islands_ had not commanded the attention of\r\nliterary genius.\r\n\r\nI do not pretend, therefore, to improve upon the able productions of\r\nsuch eminent writers as Juan de le Concepcion, Martinez Zuniga, Tomas\r\nde Comyn and others, nor do I aspire, through this brief composition,\r\nto detract from the merit of Jagor's work, which, in its day, commended\r\nitself as a valuable book of reference. But since then, and within\r\nthe last twenty years, this Colony has made great strides on the\r\npath of social and material progress; its political and commercial\r\nimportance is rapidly increasing, and many who know the Philippines\r\nhave persuaded me to believe that my notes would be an appreciated\r\naddition to what was published years ago on this subject.\r\n\r\nThe critical opinions herein expressed are based upon personal\r\nobservations made during the several years I have travelled in and\r\nabout all the principal islands of the Archipelago, and are upheld\r\nby reference to the most reliable historical records.\r\n\r\nAn author should be benevolent in his judgement of men and manners\r\nand guarded against mistaking isolated cases for rules. In matters\r\nof history he should neither hide the truth nor twist it to support\r\na private view, remembering how easy it is to criticize an act when\r\nits sequel is developed: such will be my aim in the fullest measure\r\nconsistent.\r\n\r\nBy certain classes I may be thought to have taken a hypercritical view\r\nof things; I may even offend their susceptibilities--if I adulated\r\nthem I should fail to chronicle the truth, and my work would be a\r\ndeliberate imposture.\r\n\r\nI would desire it to be understood, with regard to the classes and\r\nraces in their collectedness, that my remarks apply only to the large\r\nmajority; exceptions undoubtedly there are--these form the small\r\nminority. Moreover, I need hardly point out that the native population\r\nof the capital of the Philippines by no means represents the true\r\nnative character, to comprehend which, so far as its complicacy can\r\nbe fathomed, one must penetrate into and reside for years in the\r\ninterior of the Colony, as I have done, in places where extraneous\r\ninfluences have, as yet, produced no effect.\r\n\r\nThere may appear to be some incongruity in the plan of a work which\r\ncombines objects so dissimilar as those enumerated in the Contents\r\npages, but this is not exclusively a History, or a Geography, or an\r\nAccount of Travels--it is a concise review of all that may interest\r\nthe reader who seeks for a general idea of the condition of affairs\r\nin this Colony in the past and in the present.\r\n\r\nJ. F.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPreface to the Third Edition\r\n\r\n\r\nThe success which has attended the publication of the Second Edition\r\nof this work has induced me to revise it carefully throughout, adding\r\nthe latest facts of public interest up to the present period.\r\n\r\nLong years of personal acquaintance with many of the prime movers in\r\nthe Revolutionary Party enabled me to estimate their aspirations. My\r\nassociations with Spain and Spaniards since my boyhood helped me,\r\nas an eye-witness of the outbreak of the Rebellion, to judge of the\r\nopponents of that movement. My connection with the American Peace\r\nCommission in Paris afforded me an opportunity of appreciating the\r\nnoble desire of a free people to aid the lawful aspirations of millions\r\nof their fellow-creatures.\r\n\r\nMy criticism of the regular clergy applies only to the four religious\r\nconfraternities in their lay capacity of government agents in these\r\nIslands and not to the Jesuit or the Paul fathers, who have justly\r\ngained the respect of both Europeans and natives: neither is it\r\nintended, in any degree, as a reflection on the sacred institution\r\nof the Church.\r\n\r\nI take this opportunity of acknowledging, with gratitude, my\r\nindebtedness to Governor-General Luke E. Wright, Major-General Leonard\r\nWood, Colonel Philip Reade, Major Hugh L. Scott, Captain E. N. Jones,\r\nCaptain C. H. Martin, Captain Henry C. Cabell, Captain George Bennett,\r\nCaptain John P. Finley, Dr. David P. Barrows, Mr. Tobias Eppstein,\r\nand many others too numerous to mention, who gave me such valuable\r\nand cordial assistance in my recent investigations throughout the\r\nArchipelago.\r\n\r\nThis book is not written to promote the interests of any person or\r\nparty, and so far as is consistent with guiding the reader to a fair\r\nappreciation of the facts recorded, controversial comment has been\r\navoided, for to pronounce a just dictum on the multifarious questions\r\ninvolved would demand a catholicity of judgement never concentrated\r\nin the brain of a single human being.\r\n\r\nI am persuaded to believe that the bare truth, unvarnished by flattery,\r\nwill be acceptable to the majority, amongst whom may be counted all\r\nthose educated Americans whose impartiality is superior to their\r\npersonal interest in the subject at issue.\r\n\r\nIt is therefore confidently hoped that the present Edition may merit\r\nthat approval from readers of English which has been so graciously\r\naccorded to the previous ones.\r\n\r\nJ.

Whatever may have\r\nbeen the incentive which impelled the Spanish monarchs to encourage\r\nthe conquest of these Islands, there can, at least, be no doubt as to\r\nthe earnestness of the individuals entrusted to carry out the royal\r\nwill. The nerve and muscle of chivalrous Spain ploughing through a\r\nwide unknown ocean in quest of glory and adventure, the unswerving\r\ndevotion of the ecclesiastics to the cause of Catholic supremacy,\r\neach bearing intense privations, cannot fail to excite the wonder of\r\nsucceeding generations. But they were satisfied with conquering and\r\nleaving unimproved their conquests, for whilst only a small fraction\r\nof this Archipelago was subdued, millions of dollars and hundreds\r\nof lives were expended in futile attempts at conquest in Gamboge,\r\nSiam, Pegu, Moluccas, Borneo, Japan, etc.--and for all these toils\r\nthere came no reward, not even the sterile laurels of victory. The\r\nManila seat of government had not been founded five years when the\r\nGovernor-General solicited royal permission to conquer China!\r\n\r\nExtension of dominion seized them like a mania. Had they followed up\r\ntheir discoveries by progressive social enlightenment, by encouragement\r\nto commerce, by the concentration of their efforts in the development\r\nof the territory and the new resources already under their sway, half\r\nthe money and energy squandered on fruitless and inglorious expeditions\r\nwould have sufficed to make high roads crossing and recrossing the\r\nIslands; tenfold wealth would have accrued; civilization would have\r\nfollowed as a natural consequence; and they would, perhaps even\r\nto this day, have preserved the loyalty of those who struggled for\r\nand obtained freer institutions. But they had elected to follow the\r\nprinciples of that religious age, and all we can credit them with\r\nis the conversion of millions to Christianity and the consequent\r\ncivility at the expense of cherished liberty, for ever on the track\r\nof that fearless band of warriors followed the monk, ready to pass\r\nthe breach opened for him by the sword, to conclude the conquest by\r\nthe persuasive influence of the Holy Cross.\r\n\r\nThe civilization of the world is but the outcome of wars, and probably\r\nas long as the world lasts the ultimate appeal in all questions will\r\nbe made to force, notwithstanding Peace Conferences. The hope of ever\r\nextinguishing warfare is as meagre as the advantage such a state of\r\nthings would be. The idea of totally suppressing martial instinct in\r\nthe whole civilized community is as hopeless as the effort to convert\r\nall the human race to one religious system. Moreover, the common\r\ngood derived from war generally exceeds the losses it inflicts on\r\nindividuals; nor is war an isolated instance of the few suffering\r\nfor the good of the many. \"_Salus populi suprema lex_.\" \"Nearly\r\nevery step in the world's progress has been reached by warfare. In\r\nmodern times the peace of Europe is only maintained by the equality\r\nof power to coerce by force. Liberty in England, gained first by an\r\nexhibition of force, would have been lost but for bloodshed. The great\r\nAmerican Republic owes its existence and the preservation of its unity\r\nto this inevitable means, and neither arbitration, moral persuasion,\r\nnor sentimental argument would ever have exchanged Philippine monastic\r\noppression for freedom of thought and liberal institutions.\r\n\r\nThe right of conquest is admissible when it is exercised for the\r\nadvancement of civilization, and the conqueror not only takes upon\r\nhimself, but carries out, the moral obligation to improve the condition\r\nof the subjected peoples and render them happier. How far the Spaniards\r\nof each generation fulfilled that obligation may be judged from these\r\npages, the works of Mr. W. H. Prescott, the writings of Padre de las\r\nCasas, and other chroniclers of Spanish colonial achievements. The\r\nhappiest colony is that which yearns for nothing at the hands of\r\nthe mother country; the most durable bonds are those engendered by\r\ngratitude and contentment. Such bonds can never be created by religious\r\nteaching alone, unaccompanied by the twofold inseparable conditions\r\nof moral and material improvement. There are colonies wherein equal\r\njustice, moral example, and constant care for the welfare of the\r\npeople have riveted European dominion without the dispensable adjunct\r\nof an enforced State religion. The reader will judge the merits of\r\nthat civilization which the Spaniards engrafted on the races they\r\nsubdued; for as mankind has no philosophical criterion of truth, it is\r\na matter of opinion where the unpolluted fountain of the truest modern\r\ncivilization is to be found. It is claimed by China and by Europe, and\r\nthe whole universe is schismatic on the subject. When Japan was only\r\nknown to the world as a nation of artists, Europe called her barbarous;\r\nwhen she had killed fifty thousand Russians in Manchuria, she was\r\nproclaimed to be highly civilized. There are even some who regard\r\nthe adoption of European dress and the utterance of a few phrases in\r\na foreign tongue as signs of civilization. And there is a Continental\r\nnation, proud of its culture, whose sense of military honour, dignity,\r\nand discipline involves inhuman brutality of the lowest degree.\r\n\r\nJuan de la Concepcion, [1] who wrote in the eighteenth century,\r\nbases the Spaniards' right to conquest solely on the religious\r\ntheory. He affirms that the Spanish kings inherited a divine right\r\nto these Islands, their dominion being directly prophesied in Isaiah\r\nxviii. He assures us that this title from Heaven was confirmed by\r\napostolic authority, [2] and by \"the many manifest miracles with\r\nwhich God, the Virgin, and the Saints, as auxiliaries of our arms,\r\ndemonstrated its unquestionable justice.\" Saint Augustine, he states,\r\nconsidered it a sin to doubt the justice of war which God determines;\r\nbut, let it be remembered, the same _savant_ insisted that the world\r\nwas flat, and that the sun hid every night behind a mountain!\r\n\r\nAn apology for conquest cannot be rightly based upon the sole desire\r\nto spread any particular religion, more especially when we treat of\r\nChristianity, the benign radiance of which was overshadowed by that\r\ndebasing institution the Inquisition, which sought out the brightest\r\nintellects only to destroy them. But whether conversion by coercion\r\nbe justifiable or not, one is bound to acknowledge that all the\r\nurbanity of the Filipinos of to-day is due to Spanish training,\r\nwhich has raised millions from obscurity to a relative condition\r\nof culture. The fatal defect in the Spanish system was the futile\r\nendeavour to stem the tide of modern methods and influences.\r\n\r\nThe government of the Archipelago alone was no mean task.\r\n\r\nA group of islands inhabited by several heathen races--surrounded\r\nby a sea exposed to typhoons, pirates, and Christian-hating\r\nMussulmans--had to be ruled by a handful of Europeans with inadequate\r\nfunds, bad ships, and scant war material. For nearly two centuries\r\nthe financial administration was a chaos, and military organization\r\nhardly existed. Local enterprise was disregarded and discouraged so\r\nlong as abundance of silver dollars came from across the Pacific. Such\r\na short-sighted, unstable dependence left the Colony resourceless\r\nwhen bold foreign traders stamped out monopoly and brought commerce\r\nto its natural level by competition. In the meantime the astute\r\necclesiastics quietly took possession of rich arable lands in many\r\nplaces, the most valuable being within easy reach of the Capital\r\nand the Arsenal of Cavite. Landed property was undefined. It all\r\nnominally belonged to the State, which, however, granted no titles;\r\n\"squatters\" took up land where they chose without determined limits,\r\nand the embroilment continues, in a measure, to the present day.\r\n\r\nAbout the year 1885 the question was brought forward of granting\r\nGovernment titles to all who could establish claims to land. Indeed,\r\nfor about a year, there was a certain enthusiasm displayed both by the\r\napplicants and the officials in the matter of \"Titulos Reales.\" But\r\nthe large majority of landholders--among whom the monastic element\r\nconspicuously figured--could only show their title by actual\r\npossession. [3] It might have been sufficient, but the fact is that\r\nthe clergy favoured neither the granting of \"Titulos Reales\" nor the\r\nestablishment of the projected Real Estate Registration Offices.\r\n\r\nAgrarian disputes had been the cause of so many armed risings against\r\nthemselves in particular, during the nineteenth century, that they\r\nopposed an investigation of the land question, which would only have\r\nrevived old animosities, without giving satisfaction to either native\r\nor friar, seeing that both parties were intransigent. [4]\r\n\r\nThe fundamental laws, considered as a whole, were the wisest devisable\r\nto suit the peculiar circumstances of the Colony; but whilst many of\r\nthem were disregarded or treated as a dead letter, so many loopholes\r\nwere invented by the dispensers of those in operation as to render\r\nthe whole system a wearisome, dilatory process. Up to the last every\r\npossible impediment was placed in the way of trade expansion; and in\r\nformer times, when worldly majesty and sanctity were a joint idea,\r\nthe struggle with the King and his councillors for the right of\r\nlegitimate traffic was fierce.\r\n\r\nSo long as the Archipelago was a dependency of Mexico (up to 1819)\r\nnot one Spanish colonist in a thousand brought any cash capital to\r\nthis colony with which to develop its resources. During the first\r\ntwo centuries and a quarter Spain's exclusive policy forbade the\r\nestablishment of any foreigner in the Islands; but after they did\r\nsettle there they were treated with such courteous consideration\r\nby the Spanish officials that they could often secure favours with\r\ngreater ease than the Spanish colonists themselves.\r\n\r\nEverywhere the white race urged activity like one who sits behind a\r\nhorse and goads it with the whip. But good advice without example\r\nwas lost to an ignorant class more apt to learn through the eye\r\nthan through the ear. The rougher class of colonist either forgot,\r\nor did not know, that, to civilize a people, every act one performs,\r\nor intelligible word one utters, carries an influence which pervades\r\nand gives a colour to the future life and thoughts of the native,\r\nand makes it felt upon the whole frame of the society in embryo. On\r\nthe other hand, the value of prestige was perfectly well understood by\r\nthe higher officials, and the rigid maintenance of their dignity, both\r\nin private life and in their public offices, played an important part\r\nin the moral conquest of the Filipinos. Equality of races was never\r\ndreamed of, either by the conquerors or the conquered; and the latter,\r\nup to the last days of Spanish rule, truly believed in the superiority\r\nof the white man. This belief was a moral force which considerably\r\naided the Spaniards in their task of civilization, and has left its\r\nimpression on the character of polite Philippine society to this day.\r\n\r\nChristianity was not only the basis of education, but the symbol of\r\ncivilization; and that the Government should have left education\r\nto the care of the missionaries during the proselytizing period\r\nwas undoubtedly the most natural course to take. It was desirable\r\nthat conversion from paganism should precede any kind of secular\r\ntuition. But the friars, to the last, held tenaciously to their old\r\nmonopoly; hence the University, the High Schools, and the Colleges\r\n(except the Jesuit Schools) were in their hands, and they remained as\r\nstumbling-blocks in the intellectual advancement of the Colony. Instead\r\nof the State holding the fountains of knowledge within its direct\r\ncontrol, it yielded them to the exclusive manipulation of those who\r\neked out the measure as it suited their own interests.\r\n\r\nSuccessful government by that sublime ethical essence called \"moral\r\nphilosophy\" has fallen away before a more practical _regime_. Liberty\r\nto think, to speak, to write, to trade, to travel, was only partially\r\nand reluctantly yielded under extraneous pressure. The venality of the\r\nconqueror's administration, the judicial complicacy, want of public\r\nworks, weak imperial government, and arrogant local rule tended to\r\ndismember the once powerful Spanish Empire. The same causes have\r\nproduced the same effects in all Spain's distant colonies, and to-day\r\nthe mother country is almost childless. Criticism, physical discovery\r\nof the age, and contact with foreigners shook the ancient belief\r\nin the fabulous and the supernatural; the rising generation began\r\nto inquire about more certain scientific theses. The immutability\r\nof Theology is inharmonious to Science--the School of Progress;\r\nand long before they had finished their course in these Islands the\r\nfriars quaked at the possible consequences. The dogmatical affirmation\r\n\"_qui non credit anathema sit_,\" so indiscriminately used, had lost\r\nits power. Public opinion protested against an order of things which\r\nchecked the social and material onward movement of the Colony. And,\r\nstrange as it may seem, Spain was absolutely impotent, even though\r\nit cost her the whole territory (as indeed happened) to remedy the\r\nevil. In these Islands what was known to the world as the Government\r\nof Spain was virtually the Executive of the Religious Corporations, who\r\nconstituted the real Government, the members of which never understood\r\npatriotism as men of the world understand it. Every interest was made\r\nsubservient to the welfare of the Orders. If, one day, the Colony\r\nmust be lost to _them_, it was a matter of perfect indifference into\r\nwhose hands it passed. It was their happy hunting-ground and last\r\nrefuge. But the real Government could not exist without its Executive;\r\nand when that Executive was attacked and expelled by America, the\r\nreal Government fell as a consequence. If the Executive had been\r\nstrong enough to emancipate itself from the dominion of the friars\r\nonly two decades ago, the Philippines might have remained a Spanish\r\ncolony to-day. But the wealth in hard cash and the moral religious\r\ninfluence of the Monastic Orders were factors too powerful for any\r\nnumber of executive ministers, who would have fallen like ninepins\r\nif they had attempted to extricate themselves from the thraldom of\r\nsacerdotalism. Outside political circles there was, and still is in\r\nSpain, a class who shrink from the abandonment of ideas of centuries'\r\nduration. Whatever the fallacy may be, not a few are beguiled into\r\nthinking that its antiquity should command respect.\r\n\r\nThe conquest of this Colony was decidedly far more a religious\r\nachievement than a military one, and to the _friars of old_ their\r\nnation's gratitude is fairly due for having contributed to her glory,\r\nbut that gratitude is not an inheritance.\r\n\r\nProsperity began to dawn upon the Philippines when restrictions\r\non trade were gradually relaxed since the second decade of last\r\ncentury. As each year came round reforms were introduced, but\r\nso clumsily that no distinction was made between those who were\r\neducationally or intellectually prepared to receive them and those who\r\nwere not; hence the small minority of natives, who had acquired the\r\nhabits and necessities of their conquerors, sought to acquire for _all_\r\nan equal status, for which the masses were unprepared. The abolition of\r\ntribute in 1884 obliterated caste distinction; the university graduate\r\nand the herder were on a legal equality if they each carried a _cedula\r\npersonal_, whilst certain Spanish legislators exercised a rare effort\r\nto persuade themselves and their partisans that the Colony was ripe for\r\nthe impossible combination of liberal administration and monastic rule.\r\n\r\nIt will be shown in these pages that the government of these Islands\r\nwas practically as theocratic as it was civil. Upon the principle of\r\nreligious pre-eminence all its statutes were founded, and the reader\r\nwill now understand whence the innumerable Church and State contentions\r\noriginated. Historical facts lead one to inquire: How far was Spain\r\never a _moral_ potential factor in the world's progress? Spanish\r\ncolonization seems to have been only a colonizing mission preparatory\r\nto the attainment, by her colonists, of more congenial conditions\r\nunder other _regimes_; for the repeated struggles for liberty,\r\ngeneration after generation, in all her colonies, tend to show that\r\nSpain's sovereignty was maintained through the inspiration of fear\r\nrather than love and sympathy, and that she entirely failed to render\r\nher colonial subjects happier than they were before.\r\n\r\nOne cannot help feeling pity for the Spanish nation, which has let\r\nthe Pearl of the Orient slip out of its fingers through culpable\r\nand stubborn mismanagement, after repeated warnings and similar\r\nexperiences in other quarters of the globe. Yet although Spain's\r\nlethargic, petrified conservatism has had to yield to the progressive\r\nspirit of the times, the loss to her is more sentimental than real,\r\nand Spaniards of the next century will probably care as little about\r\nit as Britons do about the secession of their transatlantic colonies.\r\n\r\nHappiness is merely comparative: with a lovely climate--a continual\r\nsummer--and all the absolute requirements of life at hand, there is not\r\none-tenth of the misery in the Philippines that there is in Europe, and\r\nnone of that forlorn wretchedness facing the public gaze. Beggary--that\r\nconstant attribute of the highest civilization--hardly exists,\r\nand suicide is extremely rare. There are no ferocious animals,\r\ninsects, or reptiles that one cannot reasonably guard against; it\r\nis essentially one of those countries where \"man's greatest enemy is\r\nman.\" There is ample room for double the population, and yet a million\r\nacres of virgin soil only awaiting the co-operation of husbandman\r\nand capitalist to turn it to lucrative account. A humdrum life is\r\nincompatible here with the constant emotion kept up by typhoons,\r\nshipwrecks, earthquakes, tidal waves, volcanic eruptions, brigands,\r\nepidemics, devastating fires, etc.\r\n\r\nIt is a beautiful country, copiously endowed by Nature, where the\r\neffulgent morning sun contributes to a happy frame of mind--where the\r\ncolonist's rural life passes pleasantly enough to soothe the longing\r\nfor \"home, sweet home.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n    \"And yet perhaps if countries we compare\r\n    And estimate the blessings which they share,\r\n    Though patriots flatter, yet shall wisdom find\r\n    An equal portion dealt to all mankind.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nSuch is America's new possession, wherein she has assumed the moral\r\nresponsibility of establishing a form of government on principles\r\nquite opposite to those of the defunct Spanish _regime_: whether\r\nit will be for better or for worse cannot be determined at this\r\ntentative stage. Without venturing on the prophetic, one may not\r\nonly draw conclusions from accomplished facts, but also reasonably\r\nassume, in the light of past events, what might have happened under\r\nother circumstances. There is scarcely a Power which has not, in\r\nthe zenith of its prosperity, consciously or unconsciously felt the\r\n\"divine right\" impulse, and claimed that Providence has singled it\r\nout to engraft upon an unwilling people its particular conception of\r\nhuman progress. The venture assumes, in time, the more dignified name\r\nof \"mission\"; and when the consequent torrents of blood recede from\r\nmemory with the ebbing tide of forgetfulness, the conqueror soothes\r\nhis conscience with a profession of \"moral duty,\" which the conquered\r\nseldom appreciate in the first generation. No unforeseen circumstances\r\nwhatever caused the United States to drift unwillingly into Philippine\r\naffairs. The war in Cuba had not the remotest connexion with these\r\nIslands. The adversary's army and navy were too busy with the task\r\nof quelling the Tagalog rebellion for any one to imagine they could\r\nbe sent to the Atlantic. It was hardly possible to believe that\r\nthe defective Spanish-Philippine squadron could have accomplished\r\nthe voyage to the Antilles, in time of war, with every neutral port\r\n_en route_ closed against it. In any case, so far as the ostensible\r\nmotive of the Spanish-American War was concerned, American operations\r\nin the Philippines might have ended with the Battle of Cavite. The\r\nTagalog rebels were neither seeking nor desiring a change of masters,\r\nbut the state of war with Spain afforded America the opportunity,\r\ninternationally recognized as legitimate, to seize any of the enemy's\r\npossessions; hence the acquisition of the Philippines by conquest. Up\r\nto this point there is nothing to criticize, in face of the universal\r\ntacit recognition, from time immemorial, of the right of might.\r\n\r\nAmerican dominion has never been welcomed by the Filipinos. All the\r\nprincipal Christianized islands, practically representing the whole\r\nArchipelago, except Moroland, resisted it by force of arms, until,\r\nafter two years of warfare, they were so far vanquished that those\r\nstill remaining in the field, claiming to be warriors, were, judged\r\nby their exploits, undistinguishable from the brigand gangs which have\r\ninfested the Islands for a century and a half. The general desire was,\r\nand is, for sovereign independence; and although a pro-American party\r\nnow exists, it is only in the hope of gaining peacefully that which\r\nthey despaired of securing by armed resistance to superior force. The\r\nquestion as to how much nearer they are to the goal of their ambition\r\nbelongs to the future; but there is nothing to show, by a review of\r\naccomplished facts, that, without foreign intervention, the Filipinos\r\nwould have prospered in their rebellion against Spain. Even if they\r\nhad expelled the Spaniards their independence would have been of\r\nshort duration, for they would have lost it again in the struggle\r\nwith some colony-grabbing nation. A united Archipelago under the\r\nMalolos Government would have been simply untenable; for, apart\r\nfrom the possible secessions of one or more islands, like Negros,\r\nfor instance, no Christian Philippine Government could ever have\r\nconquered Mindanao and the Sulu Sultanate; indeed, the attempt might\r\nhave brought about their own ruin, by exhaustion of funds, want of\r\nunity in the hopeless contest with the Moro, and foreign intervention\r\nto terminate the internecine war. Seeing that Emilio Aguinaldo had to\r\nsuppress two rivals, even in the midst of the bloody struggle when\r\nunion was most essential for the attainment of a common end, how\r\nmany more would have risen up against him in the period of peaceful\r\nvictory? The expulsion of the friars and the confiscation of their\r\nlands would have surprised no one cognizant of Philippine history. But\r\nwhat would have become of religion? Would the predominant religion\r\nin the Philippines, fifty years hence, have been Christian? Recent\r\nevents lead one to conjecture that liberty of cult, under native rule,\r\nwould have been a misnomer, and Roman Catholicism a persecuted cause,\r\nwith the civilizing labours of generations ceasing to bear fruit.\r\n\r\nNo generous, high-minded man, enjoying the glorious privilege of\r\nliberty, would withhold from his fellow-men the fullest measure of\r\nindependence which they were capable of maintaining. If America's\r\nintentions be as the world understands them, she is endeavouring to\r\nbreak down the obstacles which the Filipinos, desiring a lasting\r\nindependence, would have found insuperable. America claims (as\r\nother colonizing nations have done) to have a \"mission\" to perform,\r\nwhich, in the present case, includes teaching the Filipinos the art of\r\nself-government. Did one not reflect that America, from her birth as an\r\nindependent state, has never pretended to follow on the beaten tracts\r\nof the Old World, her brand-new method of colonization would surprise\r\nher older contemporaries in a similar task. She has been the first to\r\nteach Asiatics the doctrine of equality of races--a theory which the\r\nproletariat has interpreted by a self-assertion hitherto unknown, and\r\na gradual relinquishment of that courteous deference towards the white\r\nman formerly observable by every European. This democratic doctrine,\r\nsuddenly launched upon the masses, is changing their character. The\r\npolite and submissive native of yore is developing into an ill-bred,\r\nup-to-date, wrangling politician. Hence rule by coercion, instead\r\nof sentiment, is forced upon America, for up to the present she\r\nhas made no progress in winning the hearts of the people. Outside\r\nthe high-salaried circle of Filipinos one never hears a spontaneous\r\nutterance of gratitude for the boon of individual liberty or for the\r\nsuppression of monastic tyranny. The Filipinos craving for immediate\r\nindependence, regard the United States only in the light of a useful\r\nmedium for its attainment, and there are indications that their\r\nfuture attachment to their stepmother country will be limited to an\r\nunsentimental acceptance of her protection as a material necessity.\r\n\r\nMeasures of practical utility and of immediate need have been set\r\naside for the pursuit of costly fantastic ideals, which excite more\r\nthe wonder than the enthusiasm of the people, who see left in abeyance\r\nthe reforms they most desire. The system of civilizing the natives\r\non a curriculum of higher mathematics, literature, and history,\r\nwithout concurrent material improvement to an equal extent, is like\r\nfeeding the mind at the expense of the body. No harbour improvements\r\nhave been made, except at Manila; no canals have been cut; few new\r\nprovincial roads have been constructed, except for military purposes;\r\nno rivers are deepened for navigation, and not a mile of railway\r\nopened. The enormous sums of money expended on such unnecessary works\r\nas the Benguet road and the creation of multifarious bureaux, with a\r\nsuperfluity of public servants, might have been better employed in\r\nthe development of agriculture and cognate wealth-producing public\r\nworks. The excessive salaries paid to high officials seem to be out of\r\nall proportion to those of the subordinate assistants. Extravagance in\r\npublic expenditure necessarily brings increasing taxation to meet it;\r\nthe luxuries introduced for the sake of American trade are gradually,\r\nand unfortunately, becoming necessities, whereas it would be more\r\nconsiderate to reduce them if it were possible. It is no blessing to\r\ncreate a desire in the common people for that which they can very\r\nwell dispense with and feel just as happy without the knowledge\r\nof. The deliberate forcing up of the cost of living has converted\r\na cheap country into an expensive one, and an income which was\r\nonce a modest competence is now a miserable pittance. The infinite\r\nvexatious regulations and complicated restrictions affecting trade\r\nand traffic are irritating to every class of business men, whilst\r\nthe Colony's indebtedness is increasing, the budget shows a deficit,\r\nand agriculture--the only local source of wealth--is languishing.\r\n\r\nInnovations, costing immense sums to introduce, are forced upon the\r\npeople, not at all in harmony with their real wants, their instincts,\r\nor their character. What is good for America is not necessarily good\r\nfor the Philippines. One could more readily conceive the feasibility of\r\n\"assimilation\" with the Japanese than with the Anglo-Saxon. To rule and\r\nto assimilate are two very different propositions: the latter requires\r\nthe existence of much in common between the parties. No legislation,\r\nexample, or tuition will remould a people's life in direct opposition\r\nto their natural environment. Even the descendants of whites in the\r\nPhilippines tend to merge into, rather than alter, the conditions of\r\nthe surrounding race, and _vice versa_. It is quite impossible for\r\na race born and living in the Tropics to adopt the characteristics\r\nand thought of a Temperate Zone people. The Filipinos are not an\r\nindustrious, thrifty people, or lovers of work, and no power on earth\r\nwill make them so. The Colony's resources are, consequently, not a\r\nquarter developed, and are not likely to be by a strict application\r\nof the theory of the \"Philippines for the Filipinos.\" But why\r\nworry about their lethargy, if, with it, they are on the way to\r\n\"perfect contentment\"?--that summit of human happiness which no one\r\nattains. Ideal government may reach a point where its exactions tend\r\nto make life a burden; practical government stops this side of that\r\npoint. White men will not be found willing to develop a policy which\r\noffers them no hope of bettering themselves; and as to labour--other\r\nwilling Asiatics are always close at hand. Uncertainty of legislation,\r\nconstantly changing laws, new regulations, the fear of a tax on\r\ncapital, and general prospective insecurity make large investors pause.\r\n\r\nDemocratic principles have been too suddenly sprung upon the\r\nmasses. The autonomy granted to the provinces needs more control\r\nthan the civil government originally intended, and ends in an\r\nappeal on almost every conceivable question being made to one\r\nman--the Gov.-General: this excessive concentration makes efficient\r\nadministration too dependent on the abilities of one person. There\r\nare many who still think, and not without reason, that ten years of\r\nmilitary rule would have been better for the people themselves. Even\r\nnow military government might be advantageously re-established in Samar\r\nIsland, where the common people are not anxious for the franchise,\r\nor care much about political rights. A reasonable amount of personal\r\nfreedom, with justice, would suffice for them; whilst the trading class\r\nwould welcome any effective and continuous protection, rather than have\r\nto shift for themselves with the risk of being persecuted for having\r\ngiven succour to the _pulajanes_ to save their own lives and property.\r\n\r\nCivil government, prematurely inaugurated, without sufficient\r\npreparation, has had a disastrous effect, and the present state of\r\nmany provinces is that of a wilderness overrun by brigand bands too\r\nstrong for the civil authority to deal with. But one cannot fail to\r\nrecognize and appreciate the humane motives which urged the premature\r\nestablishment of civil administration. Scores of nobodies before the\r\nrebellion became somebodies during the four or five years of social\r\nturmoil. Some of them influenced the final issue, others were mere\r\nshow-figures, really not more important than the _beau sabreur_ in\r\ncomic opera. Yet one and all claimed compensation for laying aside\r\ntheir weapons, and in changing the play from anarchy to civil life\r\nthese actors had to be included in the new cast to keep them from\r\nfurther mischief.\r\n\r\nThe moral conquest of the Philippines has hardly commenced. The\r\nbenevolent intentions of the Washington Government, and the\r\nirreproachable character and purpose of its eminent members who wield\r\nthe destiny of these islanders, are unknown to the untutored masses,\r\nwho judge their new masters by the individuals with whom they come into\r\nclose contact. The hearts of the people cannot be won without moral\r\nprestige, which is blighted by the presence of that undesirable class\r\nof immigrants to whom Maj.-General Leonard Wood refers so forcibly in\r\nhis \"First Report of the Moro Province.\" In this particular region,\r\nwhich is ruled semi-independently of the Philippine Commission,\r\nthe peculiar conditions require a special legislation. But, apart\r\nfrom this, the common policy of its enlightened Gov.-General would\r\nserve as a pattern of what it might be, with advantage, throughout\r\nthe Archipelago.\r\n\r\nSo much United States money and energy have been already expended\r\nin these Islands, and so far-reaching are the pledges made to their\r\ninhabitants, that American and Philippine interests are indissolubly\r\nassociated for many a generation to come. It does not necessarily\r\nfollow that the fullest measure of national liberty will create real\r\npersonal liberty. Such an idea does not at all appeal to Asiatics,\r\naccording to whose instinct every man dominates over, or is dominated\r\nby, another. If America should succeed in establishing a permanently\r\npeaceful independent Asiatic government on democratic principles,\r\nit will be one of the unparalleled achievements of the age.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER I\r\n\r\nGeneral Description of the Archipelago\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Philippine Islands, with the Sulu Protectorate, extend a little\r\nover 16 degrees of latitude--from 4 deg. 45' to 21 deg. N., and longitude\r\nfrom 116 deg. 40' to 126 deg. 30' E.--and number some 600 islands, many of\r\nwhich are mere islets, besides several hundreds of rocks jutting out\r\nof the sea. The 11 islands of primary geographical importance are\r\nLuzon, Mindanao, Samar, Panay, Negros, Palauan (Paragua), Mindoro,\r\nLeyte, Cebu, Masbate, and Bojol. Ancient maps show the islands and\r\nprovinces under a different nomenclature. For example: (old names in\r\nparentheses) Albay (Ibalon); Batangas (Comintan); Basilan (Taguima);\r\nBulacan (Meycauayan); Capis (Panay); Cavite (Cauit); Cebu (Sogbu);\r\nLeyte (Baybay); Mindoro (Mait); Negros (Buglas); Rizal (Tondo; later\r\non Manila); Surigao (Caraga); Samar (Ibabao); Tayabas (Calilayan).\r\n\r\nLuzon and Mindanao united would be larger in area than all the rest\r\nof the islands put together. Luzon is said to have over 40,000 square\r\nmiles of land area. The northern half of Luzon is a mountainous region\r\nformed by ramifications of the great cordilleras, which run N. to\r\nS. All the islands are mountainous in the interior, the principal\r\npeaks being the following, viz.:--\r\n\r\n\r\n                                        Feet above sea level\r\n\r\n        Halcon (Mindoro)                        8,868\r\n        Apo [5] (Mindanao)                      8,804\r\n        Mayon (Luzon)                           8,283\r\n        San Cristobal (Luzon)                   7,375\r\n        Isarog (Luzon)                          6,443\r\n        Banajao (Luzon)                         6,097\r\n        Labo (Luzon)                            5,090\r\n        South Caraballo (Luzon)                 4,720\r\n        Caraballo del Baler (Luzon)             3,933\r\n        Maquiling (Luzon)                       3,720\r\n\r\n\r\nMost of these mountains and subordinate ranges are thickly covered\r\nwith forest and light undergrowth, whilst the stately trees are gaily\r\nfestooned with clustering creepers and flowering parasites of the most\r\nbrilliant hues. The Mayon, which is an active volcano, is comparatively\r\nbare, whilst also the Apo, although no longer in eruption, exhibits\r\nabundant traces of volcanic action in acres of lava and blackened\r\nscoriae. Between the numberless forest-clad ranges are luxuriant plains\r\nglowing in all the splendour of tropical vegetation. The valleys,\r\ngenerally of rich fertility, are about one-third under cultivation.\r\n\r\nThere are numerous rivers, few of which are navigable by sea-going\r\nships. Vessels drawing up to 13 feet can enter the Pasig River,\r\nbut this is due to the artificial means employed.\r\n\r\nThe principal Rivers are:--In _Luzon Island_ the Rio Grande de Cagayan,\r\nwhich rises in the South Caraballo Mountain in the centre of the\r\nisland, and runs in a tortuous stream to the northern coast. It has two\r\nchief affluents, the Rio Chico de Cagayan and the Rio Magat, besides\r\na number of streams which find their way to its main course. Steamers\r\nof 11-feet draught have entered the Rio Grande, but the sand shoals\r\nat the mouth are very shifty, and frequently the entrance is closed\r\nto navigation. The river, which yearly overflows its banks, bathes\r\nthe great Cagayan Valley,--the richest tobacco-growing district in\r\nthe Colony. Immense trunks of trees are carried down in the torrent\r\nwith great rapidity, rendering it impossible for even small craft--the\r\n_barangayanes_--to make their way up or down the river at that period.\r\n\r\nThe Rio Grande de la Pampanga rises in the same mountain and flows\r\nin the opposite direction--southwards,--through an extensive plain,\r\nuntil it empties itself by some 20 mouths into the Manila Bay. The\r\nwhole of the Pampanga Valley and the course of the river present a\r\nbeautiful panorama from the summit of Arayat Mountain, which has an\r\nelevation of 2,877 feet above the sea level.\r\n\r\nThe whole of this flat country is laid out into embanked rice fields\r\nand sugar-cane plantations. The towns and villages interspersed are\r\nnumerous. All the primeval forest, at one time dense, has disappeared;\r\nfor this being one of the first districts brought under European\r\nsubjection, it supplied timber to the invaders from the earliest days\r\nof Spanish colonization.\r\n\r\nThe Rio Agno rises in a mountainous range towards the west coast\r\nabout 50 miles N.N.W. of the South Caraballo--runs southwards as\r\nfar as lat. 16 deg., where it takes a S.W. direction down to lat. 15 deg.\r\n48'--thence a N.W. course up to lat. 16 deg., whence it empties itself by\r\ntwo mouths into the Gulf of Lingayen. At the highest tides there is\r\na maximum depth of 11 feet of water on the sand bank at the E. mouth,\r\non which is situated the port of Dagupan.\r\n\r\nThe Bicol River, which flows from the Bato Lake to the Bay of San\r\nMiguel, has sufficient depth of water to admit vessels of small\r\ndraught a few miles up from its mouth.\r\n\r\nIn _Mindanao Island_ the Butuan River or Rio Agusan rises at a distance\r\nof about 25 miles from the southern coast and empties itself on the\r\nnorthern coast, so that it nearly divides the island, and is navigable\r\nfor a few miles from the mouth.\r\n\r\nThe Rio Grande de Mindanao rises in the centre of the island and\r\nempties itself on the west coast by two mouths, and is navigable\r\nfor some miles by light-draught steamers. It has a great number of\r\naffluents of little importance.\r\n\r\nThe only river in _Negros Island_ of any appreciable extent is the\r\nDanao, which rises in the mountain range running down the centre of\r\nthe island, and finds its outlet on the east coast. At the mouth it\r\nis about a quarter of a mile wide, but too shallow to permit large\r\nvessels to enter, although past the mouth it has sufficient depth\r\nfor any ship. I went up this river, six hours' journey in a boat,\r\nand saw some fine timber near its banks in many places. Here and\r\nthere it opens out very wide, the sides becoming mangrove swamps.\r\n\r\nThe most important Lakes are:--In _Luzon Island_ the Bay Lake or\r\nLaguna de Bay, supplied by numberless small streams coming from the\r\nmountainous district around it. Its greatest length from E. to W. is\r\n25 miles, and its greatest breadth N. to S. 21 miles. In it there\r\nis a mountainous island--Talim,--of no agricultural importance, and\r\nseveral islets. Its overflow forms the Pasig River, which empties\r\nitself into the Manila Bay. Each wet season--in the middle of the\r\nyear--the shores of this lake are flooded. These floods recede as the\r\ndry season approaches, but only partially so from the south coast,\r\nwhich is gradually being incorporated into the lake bed.\r\n\r\nBombon Lake, in the centre of which is a volcano in constant activity,\r\nhas a width E. to W. of 11 miles, and its length from N. to S. is\r\n14 miles. The origin of this lake is apparently volcanic. According\r\nto tradition it was formed by the terrific upheaval of a mountain\r\n7,000 or 8,000 feet high, in the year 1700. It is not supplied by any\r\nstreams emptying themselves into it (further than two insignificant\r\nrivulets), and it is connected with the sea by the Pansipit River,\r\nwhich flows into the Gulf of Balayan at lat. 13 deg. 52' N.\r\n\r\nCagayan Lake, in the extreme N.E. of the island, is about 7 miles\r\nlong by 5 miles broad.\r\n\r\nLake Bato, 3 miles across each way, and Lake Buhi, 3 miles N. to S. and\r\n2 1/2 miles wide, situated in the eastern extremity of Luzon Island,\r\nare very shallow.\r\n\r\nIn the centre of Luzon Island, in the large valley watered by\r\nthe above-mentioned Pampanga and Agno Rivers, are three lakes,\r\nrespectively Canarem, Mangabol, and Candava; the last two being\r\nlowland meres flooded and navigable by canoes in the rainy season only.\r\n\r\nIn _Mindoro Island_ there is one lake called Naujan, 2 1/2 miles from\r\nthe N.E. coast. Its greatest width is 3 miles, with 4 miles in length.\r\n\r\nIn _Mindanao Island_ there are the Lakes Maguindanao or Boayan, in\r\nthe centre of the island (20 miles E. to W. by 12 N. to S.); Lanao,\r\n18 miles distant from the north coast; Liguasan and Buluan towards\r\nthe south, connected with the Rio Grande de Mindanao, and a group of\r\nfour small lakes on the Agusuan River.\r\n\r\nThe Lanao Lake has great historical associations with the struggles\r\nbetween Christians and Moslems during the period of the Spanish\r\ndominion, and is to this day a centre of strife with the Americans.\r\n\r\nIn some of the straits dividing the islands there are strong currents,\r\nrendering navigation of sailing vessels very difficult, notably in\r\nthe San Bernadino Straits separating the Islands of Luzon and Samar,\r\nthe roadstead of Yloilo between Panay and Guimarras Islands, and the\r\npassage between the south points of Cebu and Negros Islands.\r\n\r\nMost of the islets, if not indeed the whole Archipelago, are of\r\nvolcanic origin. There are many volcanoes, two of them in frequent\r\nintermittent activity, viz. the Mayon, in the extreme east of\r\nLuzon Island, and the Taal Volcano, in the centre of Bombon Lake,\r\n34 miles due south of Manila. Also in Negros Island the Canlauan\r\nVolcano--N. lat. 10 deg. 24'--is occasionally in visible eruption. In\r\n1886 a portion of its crater subsided, accompanied by a tremendous\r\nnoise and a slight ejection of lava. In the picturesque Island of\r\nCamiguin a volcano mountain suddenly arose from the plain in 1872.\r\n\r\nThe _Mayon Volcano_ is in the north of the Province of Albay;\r\nhence it is popularly known as the Albay Volcano. Around its base\r\nthere are several towns and villages, the chief being Albay, the\r\ncapital of the province; Cagsaua (called Daraga) and Camaling on\r\nthe one side, and Malinao, Tobaco, etc., on the side facing the east\r\ncoast. The earliest eruption recorded is that of 1616, mentioned by\r\nSpilbergen. In 1769 there was a serious eruption, which destroyed the\r\ntowns of Cagsaua and Malinao, besides several villages, and devastated\r\nproperty within a radius of 20 miles. Lava and ashes were thrown out\r\nincessantly during two months, and cataracts of water were formed. In\r\n1811 loud subterranean noises were heard proceeding from the volcano,\r\nwhich caused the inhabitants around to fear an early renewal of its\r\nactivity, but their misfortune was postponed. On February 1, 1814,\r\n[6] it burst with terrible violence. Cagsaua, Badiao, and three other\r\ntowns were totally demolished. Stones and ashes were ejected in all\r\ndirections. The inhabitants fled to caves to shelter themselves. So\r\nsudden was the occurrence, that many natives were overtaken by the\r\nvolcanic projectiles and a few by lava streams. In Cagsaua nearly\r\nall property was lost. Father Aragoneses estimates that 2,200 persons\r\nwere killed, besides many being wounded.\r\n\r\nAnother eruption, remarkable for its duration, took place in 1881-82,\r\nand again in the spring of 1887; but only a small quantity of ashes\r\nwas thrown out, and did very little or no damage to the property in\r\nthe surrounding towns and villages.\r\n\r\nThe eruption of July 9, 1888, severely damaged the towns of Libog\r\nand Legaspi; plantations were destroyed in the villages of Bigaa and\r\nBonco; several houses were fired, others had the roofs crushed in;\r\na great many domestic animals were killed; fifteen natives lost their\r\nlives, and the loss of live-stock (buffaloes and oxen) was estimated\r\nat 500. The ejection of lava and ashes and stones from the crater\r\ncontinued for one night, which was illuminated by a column of fire.\r\n\r\nThe last great eruption occurred in May, 1897. Showers of red-hot\r\nlava fell like rain in a radius of 20 miles from the crater. In\r\nthe immediate environs about 400 persons were killed. In the\r\nvillage of Bacacay houses were entirely buried beneath the lava,\r\nashes, and sand. The road to the port of Legaspi was covered out of\r\nsight. In the important town of Tobaco there was total darkness and\r\nthe earth opened. Hemp plantations and a large number of cattle were\r\ndestroyed. In Libog over 100 inhabitants perished in the ruins. The\r\nhamlets of San Roque, Misericordia, and Santo Nino, with over\r\n150 inhabitants, were completely covered with burning _debris_. At\r\nnight-time the sight of the fire column, heaving up thousands of tons\r\nof stones, accompanied by noises like the booming of cannon afar off,\r\nwas indescribably grand, but it was the greatest public calamity\r\nwhich had befallen the province for some years past.\r\n\r\nThe mountain is remarkable for the perfection of its conic form. Owing\r\nto the perpendicular walls of lava formed on the slopes all around,\r\nit would seem impossible to reach the crater. The elevation of the\r\npeak has been computed at between 8,200 and 8,400 feet. I have been\r\naround the base on the E. and S. sides, but the grandest view is to\r\nbe obtained from Cagsaua (Daraga). On a clear night, when the moon\r\nis hidden, a stream of fire is distinctly seen to flow from the crest.\r\n\r\n_Taal Volcano_ is in the island of the Bombon Lake referred to\r\nabove. The journey by the ordinary route from the capital would be\r\nabout 60 miles. This volcano has been in an active state from time\r\nimmemorial, and many eruptions have taken place with more or less\r\neffect. The first one of historical importance appears to have occurred\r\nin 1641; again in 1709 the crater vomited fire with a deafening noise;\r\non September 21, 1716, it threw out burning stones and lava over the\r\nwhole island from which it rises, but so far no harm had befallen\r\nthe villagers in its vicinity. In 1731 from the waters of the lake\r\nthree tall columns of earth and sand arose in a few days, eventually\r\nsubsiding into the form of an island about a mile in circumference. In\r\n1749 there was a famous outburst which dilacerated the coniform peak\r\nof the volcano, leaving the crater disclosed as it now is. Being\r\nonly 850 feet high, it is remarkable as one of the lowest volcanoes\r\nin the world.\r\n\r\nThe last and most desolating of all the eruptions of importance\r\noccurred in the year 1754, when the stones, lava, ashes, and waves\r\nof the lake, caused by volcanic action, contributed to the utter\r\ndestruction of the towns of Taal, Tanauan, Sala, and Lipa, and\r\nseriously damaged property in Balayan, 15 miles away, whilst cinders\r\nare said to have reached Manila, 34 miles distant in a straight\r\nline. One writer says in his MS., [7] compiled 36 years after the\r\noccurrence, that people in Manila dined with lighted candles at midday,\r\nand walked about the streets confounded and thunderstruck, clamouring\r\nfor confession during the eight days that the calamity was visible. The\r\nauthor adds that the smell of the sulphur and fire lasted six months\r\nafter the event, and was followed by malignant fever, to which half the\r\ninhabitants of the province fell victims. Moreover, adds the writer,\r\nthe lake waters threw up dead alligators and fish, including sharks.\r\n\r\nThe best detailed account extant is that of the parish priest of Sala\r\nat the time of the event. [8] He says that about 11 o'clock at night\r\non August 11, 1749, he saw a strong light on the top of the Volcano\r\nIsland, but did not take further notice. At 3 o'clock the next morning\r\nhe heard a gradually increasing noise like artillery firing, which\r\nhe supposed would proceed from the guns of the galleon expected in\r\nManila from Mexico, saluting the Sanctuary of Our Lady of Cagsaysay\r\nwhilst passing. He only became anxious when the number of shots he\r\nheard far exceeded the royal salute, for he had already counted a\r\nhundred times, and still it continued. So he arose, and it occurred\r\nto him that there might be a naval engagement off the coast. He was\r\nsoon undeceived, for four old natives suddenly called out, \"Father,\r\nlet us flee!\" and on his inquiry they informed him that the island had\r\nburst, hence the noise. Daylight came and exposed to view an immense\r\ncolumn of smoke gushing from the summit of the volcano, and here and\r\nthere from its sides smaller streams rose like plumes. He was joyed\r\nat the spectacle, which interested him so profoundly that he did not\r\nheed the exhortations of the natives to escape from the grand but\r\nawful scene. It was a magnificent sight to watch mountains of sand\r\nhurled from the lake into the air in the form of erect pyramids,\r\nand then falling again like the stream from a fountain jet. Whilst\r\ncontemplating this imposing phenomenon with tranquil delight, a\r\nstrong earthquake came and upset everything in the convent. Then he\r\nreflected that it might be time to go; pillars of sand ascended out\r\nof the water nearer to the shore of the town, and remained erect,\r\nuntil, by a second earthquake, they, with the trees on the islet,\r\nwere violently thrown down and submerged in the lake. The earth\r\nopened out here and there as far as the shores of the Laguna de Bay,\r\nand the lands of Sala and Tanauan shifted. Streams found new beds and\r\ntook other courses, whilst in several places trees were engulfed in\r\nthe fissures made in the soil. Houses, which one used to go up into,\r\none now had to go down into, but the natives continued to inhabit\r\nthem without the least concern. The volcano, on this occasion, was\r\nin activity for three weeks; the first three days ashes fell like\r\nrain. After this incident, the natives extracted sulphur from the\r\nopen crater, and continued to do so until the year 1754.\r\n\r\nIn that year (1754), the same chronicler continues, between nine and\r\nten o'clock at night on May 15, the volcano ejected boiling lava,\r\nwhich ran down its sides in such quantities that only the waters\r\nof the lake saved the people on shore from being burnt. Towards the\r\nnorth, stones reached the shore and fell in a place called Bayoyongan,\r\nin the jurisdiction of Taal. Stones and fire incessantly came from\r\nthe crater until June 2, when a volume of smoke arose which seemed\r\nto meet the skies. It was clearly seen from Bauan, which is on a low\r\nlevel about four leagues (14 miles) from the lake.\r\n\r\nMatters continued so until July 10, when there fell a heavy shower\r\nof mud as black as ink. The wind changed its direction and a suburb\r\nof Sala, called Balili, was swamped with mud. This phenomenon was\r\naccompanied by a noise so great that the people of Batangas and Bauan,\r\nwho that day had seen the galleon from Acapulco passing on her home\r\nvoyage, conjectured that she had saluted the Shrine of Our Lady of\r\nCagsaysay on her way. The noise ceased, but fire still continued to\r\nissue from the crater until September 25. Stones fell all that night;\r\nand the people of Taal had to abandon their homes, for the roofs were\r\nfalling in with the weight upon them. The chronicler was at Taal\r\nat this date, and in the midst of the column of smoke a tempest of\r\nthunder and lightning raged and continued without intermission until\r\nDecember 4.\r\n\r\nThe night of All Saints' day (Nov. 1) was a memorable one, for the\r\nquantity of falling fire-stones, sand, and ashes increased, gradually\r\ndiminishing again towards November 15. Then, on that night, after\r\nvespers, great noises were heard. A long melancholy sound dinned in\r\none's ears; volumes of black smoke rose; an infinite number of stones\r\nfell, and great waves proceeded from the lake, beating the shores with\r\nappalling fury. This was followed by another great shower of stones,\r\nbrought up amidst the black smoke, which lasted until 10 o'clock at\r\nnight. For a short while the devastation was suspended prior to the\r\nlast supreme effort. All looked half dead and much exhausted after\r\nseven months of suffering in the way described. [9] It was resolved\r\nto remove the image of Our Lady of Cagsaysay and put in its place\r\nthe second image of the Holy Virgin.\r\n\r\nOn November 29, from seven o'clock in the evening, the volcano threw\r\nup more fire than all put together in the preceding seven months. The\r\nburning column seemed to mingle with the clouds; the whole of the\r\nisland was one ignited mass. A wind blew. And as the priests and the\r\nmayor (_Alcalde_) were just remarking that the fire might reach the\r\ntown, a mass of stones was thrown up with great violence; thunderclaps\r\nand subterranean noises were heard; everybody looked aghast, and nearly\r\nall knelt to pray. Then the waters of the lake began to encroach\r\nupon the houses, and the inhabitants took to flight, the natives\r\ncarrying away whatever chattels they could. Cries and lamentations\r\nwere heard all around; mothers were looking for their children in\r\ndismay; half-caste women of the Parian were calling for confession,\r\nsome of them beseechingly falling on their knees in the middle of\r\nthe streets. The panic was intense, and was in no way lessened by\r\nthe Chinese, who took to yelling in their own jargonic syllables.\r\n\r\nAfter the terrible night of November 29 they thought all was over,\r\nwhen again several columns of smoke appeared, and the priest went off\r\nto the Sanctuary of Cagsaysay, where the prior was. Taal was entirely\r\nabandoned, the natives having gone in all directions away from the\r\nlake. On November 29 and 30 there was complete darkness around the\r\nlake vicinity, and when light reappeared a layer of cinders about\r\nfive inches thick was seen over the lands and houses, and it was\r\nstill increasing. Total darkness returned, so that one could not\r\ndistinguish another's face, and all were more horror-stricken than\r\never. In Cagsaysay the natives climbed on to the housetops and threw\r\ndown the cinders, which were over-weighting the structures. On November\r\n30 smoke and strange sounds came with greater fury than anything\r\nyet experienced, while lightning flashed in the dense obscurity. It\r\nseemed as if the end of the world was arriving. When light returned,\r\nthe destruction was horribly visible; the church roof was dangerously\r\ncovered with ashes and earth, and the chronicler opines that its not\r\nhaving fallen in might be attributed to a miracle! Then there was\r\na day of comparative quietude, followed by a hurricane which lasted\r\ntwo days. All were in a state of melancholy, which was increased when\r\nthey received the news that the whole of Taal had collapsed; amongst\r\nthe ruins being the Government House and Stores, the Prison, State\r\nwarehouses and the Royal Rope Walk, besides the Church and Convent.\r\n\r\nThe Gov.-General sent food and clothing in a vessel, which was nearly\r\nwrecked by storms, whilst the crew pumped and baled out continually\r\nto keep her afloat, until at length she broke up on the shoals at\r\nthe mouth of the Pansipit River. Another craft had her mast split by\r\na flash of lightning, but reached port.\r\n\r\nWith all this, some daft natives lingered about the site of the town\r\nof Taal till the last, and two men were sepulchred in the Government\r\nHouse ruins. A woman left her house just before the roof fell in\r\nand was carried away by a flood, from which she escaped, and was\r\nthen struck dead by a flash of lightning. A man who had escaped from\r\nMussulman pirates, by whom he had been held in captivity for years,\r\nwas killed during the eruption. He had settled in Taal, and was held\r\nto be a perfect genius, for he could mend a clock!\r\n\r\nThe road from Taal to Balayan was impassable for a while on account\r\nof the quantity of lava. Taal, once so important as a trading centre,\r\nwas now gone, and Batangas, on the coast, became the future capital\r\nof the province.\r\n\r\nThe actual duration of this last eruption was 6 months and 17 days.\r\n\r\nIn 1780 the natives again extracted sulphur, but in 1790 a writer at\r\nthat date [10] says that he was unable to reach the crater owing to\r\nthe depth of soft lava and ashes on the slopes.\r\n\r\nThere is a tradition current amongst the natives that an Englishman\r\nsome years ago attempted to cut a tunnel from the base to the centre\r\nof the volcanic mountain, probably to extract some metallic product\r\nor sulphur. It is said that during the work the excavation partially\r\nfell in upon the Englishman, who perished there. The cave-like entrance\r\nis pointed out to travellers as the _Cueva del Ingles_.\r\n\r\nReferring to the volcano, Fray Gaspar de San Agustin in his History\r\n[11] remarks as follows:--\"The volcano formerly emitted many large\r\nfire-stones which destroyed the cotton, sweet potato and other\r\nplantations belonging to the natives of Taal on the slopes of the\r\n(volcano) mountain. Also it happened that if three persons arrived\r\non the volcanic island, one of them had infallibly to die there\r\nwithout being able to ascertain the cause of this circumstance. This\r\nwas related to Father Albuquerque, [12] who after a fervent deesis\r\nentreating compassion on the natives, went to the island, exorcised\r\nthe evil spirits there and blessed the land. A religious procession was\r\nmade, and Mass was celebrated with great humility. On the elevation of\r\nthe Host, horrible sounds were heard, accompanied by groaning voices\r\nand sad lamentations; two craters opened out, one with sulphur in it\r\nand the other with green water (sic), which is constantly boiling. The\r\ncrater on the Lipa side is about a quarter of a league wide; the other\r\nis smaller, and in time smoke began to ascend from this opening so that\r\nthe natives, fearful of some new calamity, went to Father Bartholomew,\r\nwho repeated the ceremonies already described. Mass was said a second\r\ntime, so that since then the volcano has not thrown out any more fire\r\nor smoke. [13] However, whilst Fray Thomas Abresi was parish priest\r\nof Taal (about 1611), thunder and plaintive cries were again heard,\r\ntherefore the priest had a cross, made of Anobing wood, borne to the\r\ntop of the volcano by more than 400 natives, with the result that\r\nnot only the volcano ceased to do harm, but the island has regained\r\nits original fertile condition.\"\r\n\r\nThe Taal Volcano is reached with facility from the N. side of the\r\nisland, the ascent on foot occupying about half an hour. Looking\r\ninto the crater, which would be about 4,500 feet wide from one border\r\nto the other of the shell, one sees three distinct lakes of boiling\r\nliquid, the colours of which change from time to time. I have been\r\nup to the crater four times; the last time the liquids in the lakes\r\nwere respectively of green, yellow, and chocolate colours. At the\r\ntime of my last visit there was also a lava chimney in the middle,\r\nfrom which arose a snow-white volume of smoke.\r\n\r\nThe Philippine Islands have numberless creeks and bays forming\r\nnatural harbours, but navigation on the W. coasts of Cebu, Negros and\r\nPalauan Islands is dangerous for any but very light-draught vessels,\r\nthe water being very shallow, whilst there are dangerous reefs all\r\nalong the W. coast of Palauan (Paragua) and between the south point\r\nof this island and Balabac Island.\r\n\r\nThe S.W. monsoon brings rain to most of the islands, and the wet\r\nseason lasts nominally six months,--from about the end of April. The\r\nother half of the year is the dry season. However, on those coasts\r\ndirectly facing the Pacific Ocean, the seasons are the reverse of this.\r\n\r\nThe hottest season is from March to May inclusive, except on the coasts\r\nwashed by the Pacific, where the greatest heat is felt in June, July,\r\nand August. The temperature throughout the year varies but slightly,\r\nthe average heat in Luzon Island being about 81 deg. 50' Fahr. In the\r\nhighlands of north Luzon, on an elevation above 4,000 feet, the maximum\r\ntemperature is 78 deg. Fahr. and the minimum 46 deg. Fahr. Zamboanga, which is\r\nover 400 miles south of Manila, is cooler than the capital. The average\r\nnumber of rainy days in Luzon during the years 1881 to 1883 was 203.\r\n\r\nCommencing July 11, 1904, three days of incessant rain in Rizal\r\nProvince produced the greatest inundation of Manila suburbs within\r\nliving memory. Human lives were lost; many cattle were washed away;\r\nbarges in the river were wrenched from their moorings and dashed\r\nagainst the bridge piers; pirogues were used instead of vehicles in\r\nthe thoroughfares; considerable damage was done in the shops and many\r\npersons had to wade through the flooded streets knee-deep in water.\r\n\r\nThe climate is a continual summer, which maintains a rich verdure\r\nthroughout the year; and during nine months of the twelve an alternate\r\nheat and moisture stimulates the soil to the spontaneous production\r\nof every form of vegetable life. The country generally is healthy.\r\n\r\nThe whole of the Archipelago, as far south as 10 deg. lat., is affected\r\nby the monsoons, and periodically disturbed by terrible hurricanes,\r\nwhich cause great devastation to the crops and other property. The\r\nlast destructive hurricane took place in September, 1905.\r\n\r\nEarthquakes are also very frequent, the last of great importance having\r\noccurred in 1863, 1880, 1892, 1894, and 1897. In 1897 a tremendous\r\ntidal wave affected the Island of Leyte, causing great destruction of\r\nlife and property. A portion of Tacloban, the capital of the island,\r\nwas swept away, rendering it necessary to extend the town in another\r\ndirection.\r\n\r\nIn the wet season the rivers swell considerably, and often overflow\r\ntheir banks; whilst the mountain torrents carry away bridges, cattle,\r\ntree trunks, etc., with terrific force, rendering travelling in some\r\nparts of the interior dangerous and difficult. In the dry season long\r\ndroughts occasionally occur (about once in three years), to the great\r\ndetriment of the crops and live-stock.\r\n\r\nThe southern boundary of the Archipelago is formed by a chain of some\r\n140 islands, stretching from the large island of Mindanao as far as\r\nBorneo, and constitutes the Sulu Archipelago, the Sultanate of which\r\nwas under the protection of Spain (_vide_ Chap. xxix.). It is now\r\nbeing absorbed, under American rule, in the rest of the Archipelago,\r\nunder the denomination of Moro Province (q.v.).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II\r\n\r\nDiscovery of the Archipelago\r\n\r\n\r\nThe discoveries of Christopher Columbus in 1492, the adventures and\r\nconquests of Hernan Cortes, Blasco Nunez de Balboa and others in\r\nthe South Atlantic, had awakened an ardent desire amongst those of\r\nenterprizing spirit to seek beyond those regions which had hitherto\r\nbeen traversed. It is true the Pacific Ocean had been seen by Balboa,\r\nwho crossed the Isthmus of Panama, but how to arrive there with his\r\nships was as yet a mystery.\r\n\r\nOn April 10, 1495, the Spanish Government published a general\r\nconcession to all who wished to search for unknown lands. This was a\r\ndirect attack upon the privileges of Columbus at the instigation of\r\nFonseca, Bishop of Burgos, who had the control of the Indian affairs\r\nof the realm. Rich merchants of Cadiz and Seville, whose imagination\r\nwas inflamed by the reports of the abundance of pearls and gold on the\r\nAmerican coast, fitted out ships to be manned by the roughest class\r\nof gold-hunters: so great were the abuses of this common licence that\r\nit was withdrawn by Royal Decree of June 2, 1497.\r\n\r\nIt was the age of chivalry, and the restless cavalier who had won\r\nhis spurs in Europe lent a listening ear to the accounts of romantic\r\nglory and wealth attained across the seas. That an immense ocean washed\r\nthe western shores of the great American continent was an established\r\nfact. That there was a passage connecting the great Southern sea--the\r\nAtlantic--with that vast ocean was an accepted hypothesis. Many had\r\nsought the passage in vain; the honour of its discovery was reserved\r\nfor Hernando de Maghallanes (Portuguese, Fernao da Magalhaes).\r\n\r\nThis celebrated man was a Portuguese noble who had received the most\r\ncomplete education in the palace of King John II. Having studied\r\nmathematics and navigation, at an early age he joined the Portuguese\r\nfleet which left for India in 1505 under the command of Almeida. He\r\nwas present at the siege of Malacca under the famous Albuquerque, and\r\naccompanied another expedition to the rich Moluccas, or Spice Islands,\r\nwhen the Islands of Banda, Tidor, and Ternate were discovered. It\r\nwas here he obtained the information which led him to contemplate\r\nthe voyage which he subsequently realized.\r\n\r\nOn his return to Portugal he searched the Crown Archives to see\r\nif the Moluccas were situated within the demarcation accorded to\r\nSpain. [14] In the meantime he repaired to the wars in Africa, where\r\nhe was wounded in the knee, with the result that he became permanently\r\nlame. He consequently retired to Portugal, and his companions in arms,\r\njealous of his prowess, took advantage of his affliction to assail him\r\nwith vile imputations. The King Emmanuel encouraged the complaints,\r\nand accused him of feigning a malady of which he was completely\r\ncured. Wounded to the quick by such an assertion, and convinced of\r\nhaving lost the royal favour, Maghallanes renounced for ever, by a\r\nformal and public instrument, his duties and rights as a Portuguese\r\nsubject, and henceforth became a naturalized Spaniard. He then\r\npresented himself at the Spanish Court, at that time in Valladolid,\r\nwhere he was well received by the King Charles I., the Bishop of\r\nBurgos, Juan Rodriguez Fonseca, Minister of Indian Affairs, and by\r\nthe King's chancellor. They listened attentively to his narration,\r\nand he had the good fortune to secure the personal protection of His\r\nMajesty, himself a well-tried warrior, experienced in adventure.\r\n\r\nThe Portuguese Ambassador, Alvaro de Acosta, incensed at the success\r\nof his late countryman, and fearing that the project under discussion\r\nwould lead to the conquest of the Spice Islands by the rival kingdom,\r\nmade every effort to influence the Court against him. At the same\r\ntime he ineffectually urged Maghallanes to return to Lisbon, alleging\r\nthat his resolution to abandon Portuguese citizenship required the\r\nsovereign sanction. Others even meditated his assassination to save\r\nthe interests of the King of Portugal. This powerful opposition only\r\nserved to delay the expedition, for finally the King of Portugal\r\nwas satisfied that his Spanish rival had no intention to authorize\r\na violation of the Convention of Demarcation.\r\n\r\nBetween King Charles and Maghallanes a contract was signed in Saragossa\r\nby virtue of which the latter pledged himself to seek the discovery\r\nof rich spice islands within the limits of the Spanish Empire. If\r\nhe should not have succeeded in the venture after ten years from\r\nthe date of sailing he would thenceforth be permitted to navigate\r\nand trade without further royal assent, reserving one-twentieth of\r\nhis net gains for the Crown. The King accorded to him the title\r\nof Cavalier and invested him with the habit of St. James and the\r\nhereditary government in male succession of all the islands he might\r\nannex. The Crown of Castile reserved to itself the supreme authority\r\nover such government. If Maghallanes discovered so many as six islands,\r\nhe was to embark merchandise in the King's own ships to the value of\r\none thousand ducats as royal dues. If the islands numbered only two,\r\nhe would pay to the Crown one-fifteenth of the net profits. The King,\r\nhowever, was to receive one-fifth part of the total cargo sent in the\r\n_first_ return expedition. The King would defray the expense of fitting\r\nout and arming five ships of from 60 to 130 tons with a total crew\r\nof 234 men; he would also appoint captains and officials of the Royal\r\nTreasury to represent the State interests in the division of the spoil.\r\n\r\nOrders to fulfil the contract were issued to the Crown officers in the\r\nport of Seville, and the expedition was slowly prepared, consisting\r\nof the following vessels, viz.: The commodore ship _La Trinidad_,\r\nunder the immediate command of Maghallanes; the _San Antonio_,\r\nCaptain Juan de Cartagena; the _Victoria_, Captain Luis de Mendoza;\r\nthe _Santiago_, Captain Juan Rodriguez Serrano; and the _Concepcion_,\r\nCaptain Gaspar de Quesada.\r\n\r\nThe little fleet had not yet sailed when dissensions arose.\r\n\r\nMaghallanes wished to carry his own ensign, whilst Doctor Sancho\r\nMatienza insisted that it should be the Royal Standard.\r\n\r\nAnother, named Talero, disputed the question of who should be the\r\nstandard-bearer. The King himself had to settle these quarrels by his\r\nown arbitrary authority. Talero was disembarked and the Royal Standard\r\nwas formally presented to Maghallanes by injunction of the King in\r\nthe Church of Santa Maria de la Victoria de la Triana, in Seville,\r\nwhere he and his companions swore to observe the usages and customs\r\nof Castile, and to remain faithful and loyal to His Catholic Majesty.\r\n\r\nOn August 10, 1519, the expedition left the port of San Lucar de\r\nBarrameda in the direction of the Canary Islands.\r\n\r\nOn December 13 they arrived safely at Rio Janeiro.\r\n\r\nFollowing the coast in search of the longed-for passage to the\r\nPacific Ocean, they entered the Solis River--so called because its\r\ndiscoverer, Joao de Solis, a Portuguese, was murdered there. Its name\r\nwas afterwards changed to that of Rio de la Plata (the Silver River).\r\n\r\nContinuing their course, the intense cold determined Maghallanes to\r\nwinter in the next large river, known then as San Julian.\r\n\r\nTumults arose; some wished to return home; others harboured a desire\r\nto separate from the fleet, but Maghallanes had sufficient tact\r\nto persuade the crews to remain with him, reminding them of the\r\nshame which would befall them if they returned only to relate their\r\nfailure. He added that, so far as he was concerned, nothing but death\r\nwould deter him from executing the royal commission.\r\n\r\nAs to the rebellious captains, Juan de Cartagena was already put\r\nin irons and sentenced to be cast ashore with provisions, and a\r\ndisaffected French priest for a companion. The sentence was carried\r\nout later on. Then Maghallanes sent a boat to each of three of the\r\nships to inquire of the captains whom they served. The reply from all\r\nwas that they were for the King and themselves. Thereupon 30 men were\r\nsent to the _Victoria_ with a letter to Mendoza, and whilst he was\r\nreading it, they rushed on board and stabbed him to death. Quesada\r\nthen brought his ship alongside of the _Trinidad_, and, with sword and\r\nshield in hand, called in vain upon his men to attack. Maghallanes,\r\nwith great promptitude, gave orders to board Quesada's vessel. The\r\nnext day Quesada was executed. After these vigorous but justifiable\r\nmeasures, obedience was ensured.\r\n\r\nStill bearing southwards within sight of the coast, on October 28,\r\n1520, the expedition reached and entered the seaway thenceforth known\r\nas the Magellan Straits, dividing the Island of Tierra del Fuego from\r\nthe mainland of Patagonia. [15]\r\n\r\nOn the way one ship had become a total wreck, and now the _San Antonio_\r\ndeserted the expedition; her captain having been wounded and made\r\nprisoner by his mutinous officers, she was sailed in the direction of\r\nNew Guinea. The three remaining vessels waited for the _San Antonio_\r\nseveral days, and then passed through the Straits. Great was the\r\nrejoicing of all when, on November 26, 1520, they found themselves\r\non the Pacific Ocean! It was a memorable day. All doubt was now at\r\nan end as they cheerfully navigated across that broad expanse of sea.\r\n\r\nOn March 16, 1521, the Ladrone Islands were reached. There the ships\r\nwere so crowded with natives that they were obliged to be expelled by\r\nforce. They stole one of the ship's boats, and ninety men were sent on\r\nshore to recover it. After a bloody combat the boat was regained, and\r\nthe fleet continued its course westward until it hove to off an islet,\r\nthen called Jomonjol, now known as Malhou, situated in the channel\r\nbetween Samar and Dinagat Islands (_vide_ map). Then coasting along\r\nthe north of the Island of Mindanao, they arrived at the mouth of the\r\nButuan River, where they were supplied with provisions by the chief. It\r\nwas Easter week, and on this shore the first Mass was celebrated in\r\nthe Philippines. The natives showed great friendliness, in return\r\nfor which Maghallanes took formal possession of their territory in\r\nthe name of Charles I. The chieftain himself volunteered to pilot\r\nthe ships to a fertile island, the kingdom of a relation of his, and,\r\npassing between the Islands of Bojol and Leyte, the expedition arrived\r\non April 7 at Cebu, where, on receiving the news, over two thousand\r\nmen appeared on the beach in battle array with lances and shields.\r\n\r\nThe Butuan chief went on shore and explained that the expedition\r\nbrought people of peace who sought provisions. The King agreed to\r\na treaty, and proposed that it should be ratified according to the\r\nnative formula--drawing blood from the breast of each party, the\r\none drinking that of the other. This form of bond was called by the\r\nSpaniards the _Pacto de sangre_, or the Blood compact (q.v.).\r\n\r\nMaghallanes accepted the conditions, and a hut was built on shore in\r\nwhich to say Mass. Then he disembarked with his followers, and the\r\nKing, Queen, and Prince came to satisfy their natural curiosity. They\r\nappeared to take great interest in the Christian religious rites and\r\nreceived baptism, although it would be venturesome to suppose they\r\nunderstood their meaning, as subsequent events proved. The princes\r\nand headmen of the district followed their example, and swore fealty\r\nand obedience to the King of Spain.\r\n\r\nMaghallanes espoused the cause of his new allies, who were at war with\r\nthe tribes on the opposite coast, and on April 25, 1521, he passed\r\nover to Magtan Island. In the affray he was mortally wounded by an\r\narrow, and thus ended his brief but lustrous career, which fills one\r\nof the most brilliant pages in Spanish annals.\r\n\r\nMaghallanes called the group of islands, so far discovered, the Saint\r\nLazarus Archipelago. In Spain they were usually referred to as the\r\nIslas del Poniente, and in Portugal as the Islas del Oriente.\r\n\r\nOn the left bank of the Pasig River, facing the City of Manila, stands\r\na monument to Maghallanes' memory. Another has been erected on the\r\nspot in Magtan Island, where he is supposed to have been slain on\r\nApril 27, 1521. Also in the city of Cebu, near the beach, there is\r\nan obelisk to commemorate these heroic events.\r\n\r\nIt was perhaps well for Maghallanes to have ended his days out of\r\nreach of his royal master. Had he returned to Spain he would probably\r\nhave met a fate similar to that which befell Columbus after all his\r\nglories. The _San Antonio_, which, as already mentioned, deserted the\r\nfleet at the Magellan Straits, continued her voyage from New Guinea to\r\nSpain, arriving at San Lucar de Barrameda in March, 1521. The captain,\r\nAlvaro Mesquita, was landed as a prisoner, accused of having seconded\r\nMaghallanes in repressing insubordination. To Maghallanes were ascribed\r\nthe worst cruelties and infraction of the royal instructions. Accused\r\nand accusers were alike cast into prison, and the King, unable to\r\nlay hands on the deceased Maghallanes, sought this hero's wife and\r\nchildren. These innocent victims of royal vengeance were at once\r\narrested and conveyed to Burgos, where the Court happened to be,\r\nwhilst the _San Antonio_ was placed under embargo.\r\n\r\nOn the decease of Maghallanes, the supreme command of the expedition in\r\nCebu Island was assumed by Duarte de Barbosa, who, with twenty-six of\r\nhis followers, was slain at a banquet to which they had been invited\r\nby Hamabar, the King of the island. Juan Serrano had so ingratiated\r\nhimself with the natives during the sojourn on shore that his life\r\nwas spared for a while. Stripped of his raiment and armour, he was\r\nconducted to the beach, where the natives demanded a ransom for his\r\nperson of two cannons from the ships' artillery. Those on board saw\r\nwhat was passing and understood the request, but they were loath\r\nto endanger the lives of all for the sake of one--\"_Melius est ut\r\npereat unus quam ut pereat communitas_\" (Saint Augustine)--so they\r\nraised anchors and sailed out of the port, leaving Serrano to meet\r\nhis terrible fate.\r\n\r\nDue to sickness, murder during the revolts, and the slaughter in Cebu,\r\nthe exploring party, now reduced to 100 souls all told, was deemed\r\ninsufficient to conveniently manage three vessels. It was resolved\r\ntherefore to burn the most dilapidated one--the _Concepcion_. At a\r\ngeneral council, Juan Caraballo was chosen Commander-in-Chief of\r\nthe expedition, with Gonzalo Gomez de Espinosa as Captain of the\r\n_Victoria_. The royal instructions were read, and it was decided\r\nto go to the Island of Borneo, already known to the Portuguese\r\nand marked on their charts. On the way they provisioned the ships\r\noff the coast of Palauan Island (Paragua), and thence navigated to\r\nwithin ten miles of the capital of Borneo (probably Brunei). Here\r\nthey fell in with a number of native canoes, in one of which was the\r\nKing's secretary. There was a great noise with the sound of drums\r\nand trumpets, and the ships saluted the strangers with their guns.\r\n\r\nThe natives came on board, embraced the Spaniards as if they were old\r\nfriends, and asked them who they were and what they came for. They\r\nreplied that they were vassals of the King of Spain and wished to\r\nbarter goods. Presents were exchanged, and several of the Spaniards\r\nwent ashore. They were met on the way by over two thousand armed\r\nmen, and safely escorted to the King's quarters. After satisfying\r\nhis Majesty's numerous inquiries, Captain Espinosa was permitted to\r\nreturn with his companions. He reported to Caraballo all he had seen,\r\nand in a council it was agreed that the town was too large and the\r\narmed men too numerous to warrant the safety of a longer stay. However,\r\nbeing in need of certain commodities, five men were despatched to the\r\ntown. As days passed by, their prolonged absence caused suspicion\r\nand anxiety, so the Spaniards took in reprisal the son of the King\r\nof Luzon Island, who had arrived there to trade, accompanied by 100\r\nmen and five women in a large prahu. The prince made a solemn vow to\r\nsee that the five Spaniards returned, and left two of his women and\r\neight chiefs as hostages. Then Caraballo sent a message to the King\r\nof Borneo, intimating that if his people were not liberated he would\r\nseize all the junks and merchandise he might fall in with and kill\r\ntheir crews. Thereupon two of the retained Spaniards were set free,\r\nbut, in spite of the seizure of craft laden with silk and cotton, the\r\nthree men remaining had to be abandoned, and the expedition set sail.\r\n\r\nFor reasons not very clear, Caraballo was deprived of the supreme\r\ncommand and Espinosa was appointed in his place, whilst Juan Sebastian\r\nElcano was elected Captain of the _Victoria_. With a native pilot,\r\ncaptured from a junk which they met on the way, the ships shaped\r\ntheir course towards the Moluccas Islands, and on November 8, 1521,\r\nthey arrived at the Island of Tidor. Thus the essential object of\r\nthe expedition was gained--the discovery of a western route to the\r\nSpice Islands.\r\n\r\nYears previous the Portuguese had opened up trade and still continued\r\nto traffic with these islands, which were rich in nutmegs, cloves,\r\ncinnamon, ginger, sage, pepper, etc. It is said that Saint Francis\r\nXavier had propagated his views amongst these islanders, some of whom\r\nprofessed the Christian faith.\r\n\r\nThe King, richly attired, went out with his suite to receive and\r\nwelcome the Spaniards. He was anxious to barter with them, and\r\nwhen the _Trinidad_ was consequently laden with valuable spices it\r\nwas discovered that she had sprung a leak. Her cargo was therefore\r\ntransferred to the sister ship, whilst the _Trinidad_ remained in\r\nTidor for repairs, and Elcano was deputed to make the voyage home\r\nwith the _Victoria_, taking the western route of the Portuguese in\r\nviolation of the Treaty of Tordesillas. Elcano's crew consisted of\r\nfifty-three Europeans and a dozen natives of Tidor. The _Victoria_\r\nstarted for Spain at the beginning of the year 1522; passed through\r\nthe Sunda Straits at great risk of being seized by the Portuguese;\r\nexperienced violent storms in the Mozambique Channel, and was almost\r\nwrecked rounding the Cape of Good Hope. A few of the crew died--their\r\nonly food was a scanty ration of rice--and in their extreme distress\r\nthey put in at Santiago Island, 350 miles W. of Cape Verd, to procure\r\nprovisions and beg assistance from the Portuguese Governor. It was\r\nlike jumping into the lion's mouth. The Governor imprisoned those who\r\nwent to him, in defence of his Sovereign's treaty rights; he seized\r\nthe boat which brought them ashore; inquired of them where they had\r\nobtained the cargo; and projected the capture of the _Victoria_.\r\n\r\nCaptain Elcano was not slow to comprehend the situation; he raised\r\nanchor and cleared out of the harbour, and, as it had happened several\r\ntimes before, those who had the misfortune to be sent ashore were\r\nabandoned by their countrymen.\r\n\r\nThe _Victoria_ made the port of San Lucar de Barrameda on September\r\n6, 1522, so that in a little over three years Juan Sebastian Elcano\r\nhad performed the most notable voyage hitherto on record--it was the\r\nfirst yet accomplished round the world. It must, however, be borne in\r\nmind that the discovery of the way to the Moluccas, going westward,\r\nwas due to Maghallanes--of Portuguese birth--and that the route thence\r\nto Europe, continuing westward, had long before been determined by\r\nthe Portuguese traders, whose charts Elcano used.\r\n\r\nWhen Elcano and his 17 companions disembarked, their appearance was\r\nmost pitiable--mere skeletons of men, weather-beaten and famished. The\r\nCity of Seville received them with acclamation; but their first\r\nact was to walk barefooted, in procession, holding lighted candles\r\nin their hands, to the church to give thanks to the Almighty for\r\ntheir safe deliverance from the hundred dangers which they had\r\nencountered. Clothes, money, and all necessaries were supplied\r\nto them by royal bounty, whilst Elcano and the most intelligent\r\nof his companions were cited to appear at Court to narrate their\r\nadventures. His Majesty received them with marked deference. Elcano was\r\nrewarded with a life pension of 500 ducats (worth at that date about\r\nL112 10s.), and as a lasting remembrance of his unprecedented feat,\r\nhis royal master knighted him and conceded to him the right of using\r\non his escutcheon a globe bearing the motto, \"_Primus circundedit me_.\"\r\n\r\nTwo of Elcano's officers, Miguel de Rodas and Francisco Alva, were\r\neach awarded a life pension of 50,000 maravedis (worth at that time\r\nabout 14 guineas), whilst the King ordered one-fourth of that fifth\r\npart of the cargo, which by contract with Maghallanes belonged to the\r\nState Treasury, to be distributed amongst the crew, including those\r\nimprisoned in Santiago Island.\r\n\r\nThe cargo of the _Victoria_ consisted of twenty-six and a half tons\r\nof cloves, a quantity of cinnamon, sandal wood, nutmegs, etc. Amongst\r\nthe Tidor Islanders who were presented to the King, one of them was\r\nnot allowed to return to his native home, because he had carefully\r\ninquired the value of the spices in the Spanish bazaars.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile the _Trinidad_ was repaired in Tidor and on her way to\r\nPanama, when continued tempests and the horrible sufferings of the\r\ncrew determined them to retrace their course to the Moluccas. In this\r\ninterval Portuguese ships had arrived there, and a fort was being\r\nconstructed to defend Portuguese interests against the Spaniards,\r\nwhom they regarded as interlopers. The _Trinidad_ was seized, and\r\nthe Captain Espinosa with the survivors of his crew were granted a\r\npassage to Lisbon, which place they reached five years after they\r\nhad set out with Maghallanes.\r\n\r\nThe enthusiasm of King Charles was equal to the importance of the\r\ndiscoveries which gave renown to his subjects and added glory to his\r\nCrown. Notwithstanding a protracted controversy with the Portuguese\r\nCourt, which claimed the exclusive right of trading with the Spice\r\nIslands, he ordered another squadron of six ships to be fitted\r\nout for a voyage to the Moluccas. The supreme command was confided\r\nto Garcia Yofre de Loaisa, Knight of Saint John, whilst Sebastian\r\nElcano was appointed captain of one of the vessels. After passing\r\nthrough the Magellan Straits, the Commander Loaisa succumbed to the\r\nfatigues and privations of the stormy voyage. Elcano succeeded him,\r\nbut only for four days, when he too expired. The expedition, however,\r\narrived safely at the Moluccas Islands, where they found the Portuguese\r\nin full possession and strongly established, but the long series of\r\ncombats, struggles and altercations which ensued between the rival\r\nPowers, in which Captain Andres de Urdaneta prominently figured,\r\nleft no decisive advantage to either nation.\r\n\r\nBut the King was in no way disheartened. A third expedition--the last\r\nunder his auspices--was organized and despatched from the Pacific\r\nCoast of Mexico by the Viceroy, by royal mandate. It was composed of\r\ntwo ships, two transports and one galley, well manned and armed, chosen\r\nfrom the fleet of Pedro Alvarado, the late Governor of Guatemala. Under\r\nthe leadership of Ruy Lopez de Villalobos it sailed on November 1,\r\n1542; discovered many small islands in the Pacific; lost the galley on\r\nthe way, and anchored off an island about 20 miles in circumference\r\nwhich was named Antonia. They found its inhabitants very hostile. A\r\nfight ensued, but the natives finally fled, leaving several Spaniards\r\nwounded, of whom six died. Villalobos then announced his intention\r\nof remaining here some time, and ordered his men to plant maize. At\r\nfirst they demurred, saying that they had come to fight, not to till\r\nland, but at length necessity urged them to obedience, and a small\r\nbut insufficient crop was reaped in due season. Hard pressed for\r\nfood, they lived principally on cats, rats, lizards, snakes, dogs,\r\nroots and wild fruit, and several died of disease. In this plight a\r\nship was sent to Mindanao Island, commanded by Bernado de la Torre,\r\nto seek provisions. The voyage was fruitless. The party was opposed\r\nby the inhabitants, who fortified themselves, but were dislodged\r\nand slain. Then a vessel was commissioned to Mexico with news and to\r\nsolicit reinforcements. On the way, Volcano Island (of the Ladrone\r\nIslands group) was discovered on August 6, 1543. A most important\r\nevent followed. The island, now known as Samar, was called the _Isla\r\nPhilipina_, and a galiot was built and despatched to the group (it\r\nis doubtful which), named by this expedition the _Philippine Islands_\r\nin honour of Philip, Prince of Asturias, the son of King Charles I.,\r\nheir apparent to the throne of Castile, to which he ascended in 1555\r\nunder the title of Philip II. on the abdication of his father.\r\n\r\nThe craft returned from the Philippine Islands laden with abundance of\r\nprovisions, with which the ships were enabled to continue the voyage.\r\n\r\nBy the royal instructions, Ruy Lopez de Villalobos was strictly\r\nenjoined not to touch at the Moluccas Islands, peace having been\r\nconcluded with Portugal. Heavy gales forced him nevertheless to take\r\nrefuge at Gilolo. The Portuguese, suspicious of his intentions in\r\nview of the treaty, arrayed their forces against his, inciting the\r\nKing of the island also to discard all Spanish overtures and refuse\r\nassistance to Villalobos. The discord and contentions between the\r\nPortuguese and Spaniards were increasing; nothing was being gained\r\nby either party. Villalobos personally was sorely disheartened\r\nin the struggle, fearing all the while that his opposition to the\r\nPortuguese in contravention of the royal instructions would only\r\nexcite the King's displeasure and lead to his own downfall. Hence\r\nhe decided to capitulate with his rival and accepted a safe conduct\r\nfor himself and party to Europe in Portuguese ships. They arrived at\r\nAmboina Island, where Villalobos, already crushed by grief, succumbed\r\nto disease. The survivors of the expedition, amongst whom were several\r\npriests, continued the journey home via Cochin China, Malacca and Goa,\r\nwhere they embarked for Lisbon, arriving there in 1549.\r\n\r\nIn 1558 King Charles was no more, but the memory of his ambition\r\noutlived him. His son Philip, equally emulous and unscrupulous,\r\nwas too narrow-minded and subtly cautious to initiate an expensive\r\nenterprise encompassed by so many hazards--as materially unproductive\r\nas it was devoid of immediate political importance. Indeed the basis\r\nof the first expedition was merely to discover a Western route to\r\nthe rich Spice Islands, already known to exist; the second went there\r\nto attempt to establish Spanish empire; and the third to search for,\r\nand annex to, the Spanish Crown, lands as wealthy as those claimed by,\r\nand now yielded to, the Portuguese.\r\n\r\nBut the value of the Philippine Islands, of which the possession was\r\nbut recent and nominal, was thus far a matter of doubt.\r\n\r\nOne of the most brave and intrepid captains of the Loaisa\r\nexpedition--Andres de Urdaneta--returned to Spain in 1536. In former\r\nyears he had fought under King Charles I., in his wars in Italy,\r\nwhen the study of navigation served him as a favourite pastime. Since\r\nhis return from the Moluccas his constant attention was given to the\r\nproject of a new expedition to the Far West, for which he unremittingly\r\nsolicited the royal sanction and assistance. But the King had grown\r\nold and weary of the world, and whilst he did not openly discourage\r\nUrdaneta's pretensions he gave him no effective aid. At length,\r\nin 1553, two years before Charles abdicated, Urdaneta, convinced of\r\nthe futility of his importunity at the Spanish Court, and equally\r\nunsuccessful with his scheme in other quarters, retired to Mexico,\r\nwhere he took the habit of an Augustine monk. Ten years afterwards\r\nKing Philip, inspired by the religious sentiment which pervaded his\r\nwhole policy, urged his Viceroy in Mexico to fit out an expedition\r\nto conquer and christianize the Philippine Islands. Urdaneta, now a\r\npriest, was not overlooked. Accompanied by five priests of his Order,\r\nhe was entrusted with the spiritual care of the races to be subdued\r\nby an expedition composed of four ships and one frigate well armed,\r\ncarrying 400 soldiers and sailors, commanded by a Basque navigator,\r\nMiguel Lopez de Legaspi. This remarkable man was destined to acquire\r\nthe fame of having established Spanish dominion in these Islands. He\r\nwas of noble birth and a native of the Province of Guipuzcoa in\r\nSpain. Having settled in the City of Mexico, of which place he was\r\nelected Mayor, he there practised as a notary. Of undoubted piety,\r\nhe enjoyed reputation for his justice and loyalty; hence he was\r\nappointed General of the forces equipped for the voyage.\r\n\r\nThe favourite desire to possess the valuable Spice Islands still\r\nlurked in the minds of many Spaniards. Amongst them was Urdaneta, who\r\nlaboured in vain to persuade the Viceroy of the superior advantages\r\nto be gained by annexing New Guinea instead of the Philippines, whence\r\nthe conquest of the Moluccas would be but a facile task. However, the\r\nViceroy was inexorable and resolved to fulfil the royal instructions\r\nto the letter, so the expedition set sail from the Mexican port of\r\nNavidad for the Philippine Islands on November 21, 1564.\r\n\r\nThe Ladrone Islands were passed on January 9, 1565, and on the 13th\r\nof the following month the Philippines were sighted. A call for\r\nprovisions was made at several small islands, including Camiguin,\r\nwhence the expedition sailed to Bojol Island. A boat despatched to\r\nthe port of Butuan returned in a fortnight with the news that there\r\nwas much gold, wax, and cinnamon in that district. A small vessel was\r\nalso sent to Cebu, and on its return reported that the natives showed\r\nhostility, having decapitated one of the crew whilst he was bathing.\r\n\r\nNevertheless, General Legaspi resolved to put in at Cebu, which was\r\na safe harbour; and on the way there the ships anchored off Limasana\r\nIsland (to the south of Leyte). Thence, running south-west, the port\r\nof Dapitan (Mindanao Is.) was reached.\r\n\r\nPrince Pagbuaya, who ruled there, was astonished at the sight\r\nof such formidable ships, and commissioned one of his subjects,\r\nspecially chosen for his boldness, to take note of their movements,\r\nand report to him. His account was uncommonly interesting. He related\r\nthat enormous men with long, pointed noses, dressed in fine robes,\r\nate stones (hard biscuits), drank fire, and blew smoke out of their\r\nmouths and through their nostrils. Their power was such that they\r\ncommanded thunder and lightning (discharge of artillery), and that\r\nat meal times they sat down at a clothed table. From their lofty\r\nport, their bearded faces, and rich attire, they might have been\r\nthe very gods manifesting themselves to the natives; so the Prince\r\nthought it wise to accept the friendly overtures of such marvellous\r\nstrangers. Besides obtaining ample provisions in barter for European\r\nwares, Legaspi procured from this chieftain much useful information\r\nrespecting the condition of Cebu. He learnt that it was esteemed a\r\npowerful kingdom, of which the magnificence was much vaunted amongst\r\nthe neighbouring states; that the roadstead was one of great safety,\r\nand the most favourably situated amongst the islands of the painted\r\nfaces. [16]\r\n\r\nThe General resolved, therefore, to filch it from its native king\r\nand annex it to the Crown of Castile.\r\n\r\nHe landed in Cebu on April 27, 1565, and negotiations were entered\r\ninto with the natives of that island. Remembering, by tradition,\r\nthe pretensions of the Maghallanes' party, they naturally opposed\r\nthis renewed menace to their independence. The Spaniards occupied\r\nthe town by force and sacked it, but for months were so harassed by\r\nthe surrounding tribes that a council was convened to discuss the\r\nprudence of continuing the occupation. The General decided to remain;\r\nlittle by little the natives yielded to the new condition of things,\r\nand thus the first step towards the final conquest was achieved. The\r\nnatives were declared Spanish subjects, and hopeful with the success\r\nthus far attained, Legaspi determined to send despatches to the King\r\nby the priest Andres de Urdaneta, who safely arrived at Navidad on\r\nOctober 3, 1565, and proceeded thence to Spain. In a letter written\r\nby Legaspi in 1567 he alluded, for the first time, to the whole\r\narchipelago as the Islas Filipinas.\r\n\r\nThe pacification of Cebu and the adjacent islands was steadily and\r\nsuccessfully pursued by Legaspi; the confidence of the natives was\r\nassured, and their dethroned King Tupas accepted Christian baptism,\r\nwhilst his daughter married a Spaniard.\r\n\r\nIn the midst of the invaders' felicity the Portuguese arrived to\r\ndispute the possession, but they were compelled to retire. A fortress\r\nwas constructed and plots of land were marked out for the building\r\nof the Spanish settlers' residences; and finally, in 1570, Cebu was\r\ndeclared a city, after Legaspi had received from his royal master\r\nthe title of Gov.-General of all the lands which he might be able\r\nto conquer.\r\n\r\nIn May, 1570, Captain Juan Salcedo, Legaspi's grandson, was despatched\r\nto the Island of Luzon to reconnoitre the territory and bring it\r\nunder Spanish dominion.\r\n\r\nThe history of these early times is very confused, and there are\r\nmany contradictions in the authors of the Philippine chronicles,\r\nnone of which seem to have been written contemporaneously with the\r\nfirst events. It appears, however, that Martin de Goiti and a few\r\nsoldiers accompanied Salcedo to the north. They were well received\r\nby the native chiefs or petty kings Lacandola, Rajah of Tondo (known\r\nas Rajah Matanda, which means in native dialect the aged Rajah),\r\nand his nephew the young Rajah Soliman of Manila.\r\n\r\nThe sight of a body of European troops armed as was the custom in\r\nthe 16th century, must have profoundly impressed and overawed these\r\nchieftains, otherwise it seems almost incredible that they should\r\nhave consented, without protest, or attempt at resistance, to (for\r\never) give up their territory, yield their independence, pay tribute,\r\n[17] and become the tools of invading foreigners for the conquest of\r\ntheir own race without recompense whatsoever.\r\n\r\nA treaty of peace was signed and ratified by an exchange of drops of\r\nblood between the parties thereto. Soliman, however, soon repented of\r\nhis poltroonery, and roused the war-cry among some of his tribes. To\r\nsave his capital (then called Maynila) falling into the hands of the\r\ninvaders he set fire to it. Lacandola remained passively watching the\r\nissue. Soliman was completely routed by Salcedo, and pardoned on his\r\nagain swearing fealty to the King of Spain. Goiti remained in the\r\nvicinity of Manila with his troops, whilst Salcedo fought his way\r\nto the Bombon Lake (Taal) district. The present Batangas Province\r\nwas subdued by him and included in the jurisdiction of Mindoro\r\nIsland. During the campaign Salcedo was severely wounded by an arrow\r\nand returned to Manila.\r\n\r\nLegaspi was in the Island of Fanay when Salcedo (some writers say\r\nGoiti) arrived to advise him of what had occurred in Luzon. They at\r\nonce proceeded together to Cavite, where Lacandola visited Legaspi\r\non board, and, prostrating himself, averred his submission. Then\r\nLegaspi continued his journey to Manila, and was received there\r\nwith acclamation. He took formal possession of the surrounding\r\nterritory, declared Manila to be the capital of the Archipelago,\r\nand proclaimed the sovereignty of the King of Spain over the whole\r\ngroup of islands. Gaspar de San Agustin, writing of this period, says:\r\n\"He (Legaspi) ordered them (the natives) to finish the building of\r\nthe fort in construction at the mouth of the river (Pasig) so that\r\nHis Majesty's artillery might be mounted therein for the defence of\r\nthe fort and the town. Also he ordered them to build a large house\r\ninside the battlement walls for Legaspi's own residence--another\r\nlarge house and church for the priests, etc. ... Besides these two\r\nlarge houses, he told them to erect a hundred and fifty dwellings of\r\nmoderate size for the remainder of the Spaniards to live in. All this\r\nthey promptly promised to do, but they did not obey, for the Spaniards\r\nwere themselves obliged to terminate the work of the fortifications.\"\r\n\r\nThe City Council of Manila was constituted on June 24, 1571. On August\r\n20, 1572, Miguel Lopez de Legaspi succumbed to the fatigues of his\r\narduous life, leaving behind him a name which will always hold a\r\nprominent place in Spanish colonial history. He was buried in Manila\r\nin the Augustine Chapel of San Fausto, where hung the Royal Standard\r\nand the hero's armorial bearings until the British troops occupied\r\nthe city in 1763. A street in Manila and others in provincial towns\r\nbear his name. Near the Luneta Esplanade, Manila, there is a very\r\nbeautiful Legaspi (and Urdaneta) monument, erected shortly after the\r\nRebellion of 1896.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n    \"Death makes no conquest of this conqueror,\r\n    For now he lives in fame, though not in life.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n    _Richard III._, Act 3, Sc. 1.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the meantime Salcedo continued his task of subjecting the tribes in\r\nthe interior. The natives of Taytay and Cainta, in the Spanish military\r\ndistrict of Morong, (now Rizal Province) submitted to him on August\r\n15, 1571. He returned to the Laguna de Bay to pacify the villagers,\r\nand penetrated as far as Camarines Norte to explore the Bicol\r\nRiver. Bolinao and the provinces of Pangasinan and Ilocos yielded to\r\nhis prowess, and in this last province he had well established himself\r\nwhen the defence of the capital obliged him to return to Manila.\r\n\r\nAt the same time Martin de Goiti was actively employed in overrunning\r\nthe Pampanga territory with the double object of procuring supplies for\r\nthe Manila camp and coercing the inhabitants on his way to acknowledge\r\ntheir new liege lord. It is recorded that in this expedition Goiti\r\nwas joined by the Rajahs of Tondo and Manila. Yet Lacandola appears to\r\nhave been regarded more as a servant of the Spaniards _nolens volens_\r\nthan as a free ally, for, because he absented himself from Goiti's camp\r\n\"without licence from the _Maestre de Campo_,\" he was suspected by\r\nsome writers of having favoured opposition to the Spaniards' incursions\r\nin the Marshes of Hagonoy (Pampanga coast, N. boundary of Manila Bay).\r\n\r\nThe district which constituted the ancient province of Taal\r\ny Balayan, subsequently denominated Province of Batangas, was\r\nformerly governed by a number of caciques, the most notable of\r\nwhom were Gatpagil and Gatjinlintan. They were usually at war\r\nwith their neighbours. Gatjinlintan, the cacique of the Batangas\r\nRiver (Pansipit?) at the time of the conquest, was famous for his\r\nvalour. Gatsungayan, who ruled on the other side of the river,\r\nwas celebrated as a hunter of deer and wild boar. These men were\r\nhalf-castes of Borneo and Aeta extraction, who formed a distinct\r\nrace called by the natives Daghagang. None of them would submit to\r\nthe King of Spain or become Christians, hence their descendants were\r\noffered no privileges.\r\n\r\nThe Aetas collected tribute. Gabriel Montoya, a Spanish soldier of\r\nLegaspi's legion, partially conquered those races, and supported\r\nthe mission of an Austin friar amongst them. This was probably Fray\r\nDiego Moxica, who undertook the mission of Batangas on its separation\r\nfrom the local administration of Mindoro Island in 1581. The first\r\nGovernor of San Pablo or Sampaloc in the name of the King of Spain was\r\nappointed by the soldier Montoya, and was called Bartolome Maghayin;\r\nthe second was Cristobal Somangalit and the third was Bernabe Pindan,\r\nall of whom had adopted Christianity. Bay, on the borders of the lake\r\nof that name, and four leagues from San Pablo, was originally ruled\r\nby the cacique Agustin Maglansangan. Calilayan, now called Tayabas,\r\nwas founded by the woman Ladia, and subsequently administered by a\r\nnative _Alcalde_, who gave such satisfaction that he was three times\r\nappointed the King's lieutenant and baptized as Francisco de San Juan.\r\n\r\nSan Pablo, the centre of a once independent district, is situated at\r\nthe foot of the mountains of San Cristobal and Banajao, from which\r\nover fourteen streams of fresh water flow through the villages.\r\n\r\nThe system established by Juan Salcedo was to let the conquered lands\r\nbe governed by the native caciques and their male successors so long as\r\nthey did so in the name of the King of Castile. Territorial possession\r\nseems to have been the chief aim of the earliest European invaders,\r\nand records of having improved the condition of the people or of\r\nhaving opened up means of communication and traffic as they went on\r\nconquering, or even of having explored the natural resources of the\r\ncolony for their own benefit, are extremely rare.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III\r\n\r\nPhilippine Dependencies, Up To 1898\r\nThe Ladrones, Carolines and Pelew Islands\r\n\r\n\r\nIn 1521 Maghallanes cast anchor off the Ladrone Islands (situated\r\nbetween 17 deg. and 20 deg. N. lat. by 146 deg. E. long.) on his way to the\r\ndiscovery of those Islands afterwards denominated the Philippines. This\r\ngroup was named by him Islas de las Velas. [18] Legaspi called them\r\nthe Ladrones. [19] Subsequently several navigators sighted or touched\r\nat these Islands, and the indistinct demarcation which comprised them\r\nacquired the name of Saint Lazarus' Archipelago.\r\n\r\nIn 1662 the Spanish vessel _San Damian_, on her course from Mexico\r\nto Luzon, anchored here. On board was a missionary, Fray Diego Luis\r\nde San Victores, who was so impressed with the dejected condition\r\nof the natives, that on reaching Manila he made it his common theme\r\nof conversation. In fact, so importunately did he pursue the subject\r\nwith his superiors that he had to be constrained to silence. In the\r\nfollowing year the Governor, Diego Salcedo, replied to his urgent\r\nappeal for a mission there in terms which permitted no further\r\nsolicitation in that quarter. But the friar was persistent in his\r\nproject, and petitioned the Archbishop's aid. The prelate submitted\r\nthe matter to King Philip IV., and the friar himself wrote to his\r\nfather, who presented a memorial to His Majesty and another to the\r\nQueen beseeching her influence. Consequently in 1666 a Royal Decree\r\nwas received in Manila sanctioning a mission to the Ladrones.\r\n\r\nFray Diego took his passage in the galleon _San Diego_, and having\r\narrived safely in the Viceregal Court of Mexico, he pressed his views\r\non the Viceroy, who declared that he had no orders. Then the priest\r\nappealed to the Viceroy's wife, who, it is said, was entreating her\r\nhusband's help on bended knee, when an earthquake occurred which\r\nconsiderably damaged the city. It was a manifestation from heaven,\r\nthe wily priest avowed, and the Viceroy, yielding to the superstition\r\nof the age, complied with the friar's request.\r\n\r\nTherefore, in March, 1668, Fray Diego started from Acapulco in charge\r\nof a Jesuit mission for the Ladrones, where they subsequently received\r\na pension of P3,000 per annum from Queen Maria Ana, who, meanwhile,\r\nhad become a widow and Regent. To commemorate this royal munificence,\r\nthese Islands have since been called by the Spaniards \"Islas Marianas,\"\r\nalthough the older name--Ladrones--is better known to the world.\r\n\r\nWhen the mission was fairly established, troops were sent there,\r\nconsisting of twelve Spaniards and nineteen Philippine natives,\r\nwith two pieces of artillery.\r\n\r\nThe acquiescence of the Ladrone natives was being steadily gained by\r\nthe old policy of conquest, under the veil of Christianity, when they\r\nsuddenly rebelled against the stranger's religion, which brought with\r\nit restraint of liberty and a social dominion practically amounting\r\nto slavery. Fortunately, Nature came again to the aid of Fray Diego,\r\nfor, whilst the natives were in open revolt, a severe storm levelled\r\ntheir huts to the ground, and the priest having convinced them that\r\nit was a visitation from heaven, peace was concluded.\r\n\r\nFray Diego left the mission for Visayas, where he was killed. After\r\nhis departure the natives again revolted against servile subjection,\r\nand many priests were slain from time to time--some in the exercise\r\nof their sacerdotal functions, others in open warfare.\r\n\r\nIn 1778 a Governor was sent there from Mexico with thirty soldiers,\r\nbut he resigned his charge after two years' service, and others\r\nsucceeded him.\r\n\r\nThe Islands are very poor. The products are Rice, Sago, Cocoanuts,\r\nand Cane-sugar to a small extent; there are also pigs and fowls in\r\nabundance. The Spaniards taught the natives the use of fire. They\r\nwere a warlike people; every man had to carry arms. Their language\r\nis Chamorro, much resembling the Visayan dialect. The population,\r\nfor a hundred years after the Spanish occupation, diminished. Women\r\npurposely sterilised themselves. Some threw their new born offspring\r\ninto the sea, hoping to liberate them from a world of woe, and\r\nthat they would regenerate in happiness. In the beginning of the\r\n17th century the population was further diminished by an epidemic\r\ndisease. During the first century of Spanish rule, the Government\r\nwere never able to exact the payment of tribute. Up to the Spanish\r\nevacuation the revenue of these Islands was not nearly sufficient\r\nto cover the entire cost of administration. About twenty years ago\r\nGovernor Pazos was assassinated there by a rebellious group.\r\n\r\nThere were nine towns with parish priests. All the churches were\r\nbuilt of stone, and roofed with reed thatching, except that of the\r\ncapital, which had an iron roof. Six of the towns had Town Halls made\r\nof bamboo and reed grass; one had a wooden building, and in two of them\r\n(including the capital) the Town Halls were of stone.\r\n\r\nThe Seat of Government was at Agana (called in old official documents\r\nthe \"City of San Ignacio de Agana\"). It is situated in the Island of\r\nGuam, in the creek called the Port of Apra. Ships have to anchor about\r\ntwo miles off Punta Piti, where passengers, stores, and mails are\r\nconveyed to a wooden landing-stage. Five hundred yards from here was\r\nthe Harbour-master's office, built of stone, with a tile roof. From\r\nPunta Piti there was a bad road of about five miles. The situation\r\nof Agana seems to be ill-suited for communication with vessels, and\r\nproposals were ineffectually made by two Governors, since 1835, to\r\nestablish the capital town elsewhere. The central Government took no\r\nheed of their recommendations. In Agana there was a Government House,\r\na Military Hospital and Pharmacy, an Artillery Depot and Infantry\r\nBarracks, a well-built Prison, a Town Hall, the Administrator's Office\r\n(called by the natives \"the shop\"), and the ruins of former public\r\nbuildings. It is a rather pretty town, but there is nothing notable\r\nto be seen.\r\n\r\nThe natives are as domesticated as the Philippine Islanders, and\r\nhave much better features. Spanish and a little English are spoken\r\nby many of them, as these Islands in former years were the resort\r\nof English-speaking whalemen. For the Elementary Education of the\r\nnatives, there was the College of San Juan de Letran for boys, and\r\na girls' school in Agana; and in 7 of the towns there was, in 1888,\r\na total of 4 schools for boys, 5 schools for girls, and 9 schools\r\nfor both sexes, under the direction of 20 masters and 6 mistresses.\r\n\r\nWhen the Ladrone Islands (Marianas) were a dependency of the\r\nSpanish-Philippine General-Government, a subsidized mail steamer left\r\nManila for Agana, and two or three other ports, every three months.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAn island was discovered by one of the Spanish galleon pilots in\r\n1686, and called _Carolina_, in honour of Charles II. of Spain,\r\nbut its bearings could not be found again for years.\r\n\r\nIn 1696 two canoes, with 29 Pelew Islanders, drifted to the coast\r\nof Samar Island, and landed at the Town of Guivan. They were 60\r\ndays on the drift, and five of them died of privations. They were\r\nterror-stricken when they saw a man on shore making signs to them. When\r\nhe went out to them in a boat, and boarded one of the canoes, they all\r\njumped out and got into the other; then when the man got into that,\r\nthey were in utter despair, considering themselves prisoners.\r\n\r\nThey were conducted to the Spanish priest of Guivan, whom they supposed\r\nwould be the King of the Island, and on whom would depend their lives\r\nand liberty. They prostrated themselves, and implored his mercy and\r\nthe favour of sparing their lives, whilst the priest did all he could,\r\nby signs, to reassure them.\r\n\r\nIt happened that there had been living here, for some years, two other\r\nstrange men brought to this shore by currents and contrary winds. These\r\ncame forward to see the novelty, and served as interpreters, so that\r\nthe newcomers were all lodged in native houses in twos and threes,\r\nand received the best hospitality.\r\n\r\nThey related that their Islands numbered 32, and only produced\r\nfowls and sea-birds. One man made a map, by placing stones in the\r\nrelative position of the Islands. When asked about the number of the\r\ninhabitants, one took a handful of sand to demonstrate that they were\r\ncountless. There was a King, they explained, who held his court in\r\nthe Island of Lamurrec, to whom the chiefs were subject. They much\r\nrespected and obeyed him. Among the castaways was a chief, with his\r\nwife--the daughter of the King.\r\n\r\nThe men had a leaf-fibre garment around their loins, and to it\r\nwas attached a piece of stuff in front, which was thrown over the\r\nshoulders and hung loose at the back. The women were dressed the\r\nsame as the men, except that their loin vestment reached to their\r\nknees. The King's daughter wore, moreover, tortoise-shell ornaments.\r\n\r\nThey were afraid when they saw a cow and a dog, their Island having\r\nno quadrupeds. Their sole occupation consisted in providing food for\r\ntheir families. Their mark of courtesy was to take the hand of the\r\nperson whom they saluted and pass it softly over the face.\r\n\r\nThe priest gave them pieces of iron, which they prized as if they\r\nhad been of gold, and slept with them under their heads. Their only\r\narms were lances, with human bones for points. They seemed to be a\r\npacific people, intelligent and well-proportioned physically. Both\r\nsexes wore long hair down to their shoulders.\r\n\r\nVery content to find so much luxury in Samar, they offered to return\r\nand bring their people to trade. The Jesuits considered this a capital\r\npretext for subjecting their Islands, and the Government approved of\r\nit. At the instance of the Pope, the King ordered the Gov.-General,\r\nDomingo Zabalburu, to send out expeditions in quest of these Islands;\r\nand, between 1708 and 1710, several unsuccessful efforts were made\r\nto come across them. In 1710, two islands were discovered, and named\r\nSan Andres. Several canoes arrived alongside of the ship, and the\r\noccupants accepted the Commander's invitation to come on board. They\r\nwere much astonished to see the Spaniards smoke, and admired the\r\niron fastenings of the vessel. When they got near shore, they all\r\nbegan to dance, clapping their hands to beat time. They measured the\r\nship, and wondered where such a large piece of wood could have come\r\nfrom. They counted the crew, and presented them with cocoanuts, fish,\r\nand herbs from their canoes. The vessel anchored near to the shore,\r\nbut there was a strong current and a fresh wind blowing, so that it was\r\nimprudent to disembark. However, two priests insisted upon erecting\r\na cross on the shore, and were accompanied by the quarter-master and\r\nan officer of the troops. The weather compelled the master to weigh\r\nanchor, and the vessel set sail, leaving on land the four Europeans,\r\nwho were ultimately murdered. For a quarter of a century these Islands\r\nwere lost again to the Spaniards.\r\n\r\nIn 1721 two Caroline prahus were wafted to the Ladrone Islands, where\r\nD. Luiz Sanchez was Governor. The Caroline Islanders had no idea\r\nwhere they had landed, and were quite surprised when they beheld the\r\npriest. He forcibly detained these unfortunate people, and handed\r\nthem over to the Governor, whom they entreated, with tears--but\r\nall in vain--to be allowed to return to their homes. There they\r\nremained prisoners, until it suited the Governor's convenience to\r\nsend a vessel with a priest to their Island. The priest went there,\r\nand thence to Manila, where a fresh expedition was fitted out. It\r\nwas headed by a missionary, and included a number of soldiers whom\r\nthe natives massacred soon after their arrival. All further attempt\r\nto subdue the Caroline Islands was necessarily postponed.\r\n\r\nThe natives, at that time, had no religion at all, or were, in a\r\nvague sense, polytheists. Their wise men communicated with the\r\nsouls of the defunct. They were polygamists, but had a horror\r\nof adultery. Divorce was at once granted by the chiefs on proof\r\nof infidelity. They were cannibals. In each island there was a\r\nchief, regarded as a semi-spiritual being, to whom the natives were\r\nprofoundly obedient. Huts were found used as astrological schools,\r\nwhere also the winds and currents were studied. They made cloth of\r\nplantain-fibre--hatchets with stone heads. Between sunset and sunrise\r\nthey slept. When war was declared between two villages or tribes,\r\neach formed three lines of warriors, 1st, young men; 2nd, tall men;\r\n3rd, old men; then the combatants pelted each other with stones and\r\nlances. A man _hors de combat_ was replaced by one of the back file\r\ncoming forward. When one party acknowledged themselves vanquished,\r\nit was an understood privilege of the victors to shower invectives on\r\ntheir retiring adversaries. They lived on fruits, roots and fish. There\r\nwere no quadrupeds and no agriculture.\r\n\r\nMany Spanish descendants were found, purely native in their habits,\r\nand it was remembered that about the year 1566, several Spaniards\r\nfrom an expedition went ashore on some islands, supposed to be these,\r\nand were compelled to remain there.\r\n\r\nThe Carolines (\"Islas Carolinas\") and Pelews (\"Islas Palaos\")\r\ncomprise some 48 groups of islands and islets, making a total of about\r\n500. Their relative position to the Ladrone Islands is--of the former,\r\nS.S.W. stretching to S.E.; of the latter, S.W. Both groups lie due\r\nE. of Mindanao Island (_vide_ map). The principal Pelew Islands\r\nare Babel-Druap and Kosor--Yap and Ponape (Ascencion Is.) are the\r\nmost important of the Carolines. The centres of Spanish Government\r\nwere respectively in Yap and Babel-Druap, with a Vice-Governor\r\nof the Eastern Carolines in Ponape--all formerly dependent on the\r\nGeneral-Government in Manila. The Carolines and Pelews were included\r\nin the Bishopric of Cebu, and were subject, judicially, to the Supreme\r\nCourt of Manila.\r\n\r\nThese Islands were subsequently many times visited by ships of other\r\nnations, and a barter trade gradually sprang up in dried cocoanut\r\nkernels (coprah) for the extraction of oil in Europe and America. Later\r\non, when the natives were thoroughly accustomed to the foreigners,\r\nBritish, American, and German traders established themselves on shore,\r\nand vessels continued to arrive with European and American manufactures\r\nin exchange for coprah, trepang, ivory-nuts, tortoise-shell, etc.\r\n\r\nAnglo-American missionaries have settled there, and a great number\r\nof natives profess Christianity in the Protestant form. Religious\r\nbooks in native dialect, published in Honolulu (Sandwich Is.) by the\r\nHawaiian Evangelical Association, are distributed by the American\r\nmissionaries. I have one before me now, entitled \"Kapas Fel, Puk Eu,\"\r\ndescribing incidents from the Old Testament. A few of the natives\r\ncan make themselves understood in English. Besides coprah (the\r\nchief export) the Islands produce Rice, Yams, Bread-fruit (_rima_),\r\nSugar-cane, etc. Until 1886 there was no Government, except that of\r\nseveral petty kings or chiefs, each of whom still rules over his own\r\ntribe, although the Protestant missionaries exercised a considerable\r\nsocial influence.\r\n\r\nIn 1885 a Spanish naval officer, named Capriles, having been appointed\r\nGovernor of the Islands, arrived at Yap, ostensibly with the object\r\nof landing to hoist the Spanish flag as a signal of possession,\r\nfor it was known in official quarters that the Germans were about\r\nto claim sovereignty. However, three days were squandered (perhaps\r\nintentionally) in trivial formalities, and although two Spanish\r\nmen-o'-war--the _Manila_ and the _San Quintin_--were already anchored\r\nin the Port of Yap, the German warship _Iltis_ entered, landed marines,\r\nand hoisted their national flag, whilst the Spaniards looked on. Then\r\nthe German Commander went on board the _San Quintin_ to tell the\r\nCommander that possession of the Islands had been taken in the name of\r\nthe Emperor of Germany. Neither Capriles, the appointed Governor, nor\r\nEspana, the Commander of the _San Quintin_, made any resistance; and\r\nas we can hardly attribute their inactivity to cowardice, presumably\r\nthey followed their Government's instructions. Capriles and Espana\r\nreturned to Manila, and were both rewarded for their inaction; the\r\nformer being appointed to the Government of Mindoro Island. In Manila\r\nan alarming report was circulated that the Germans contemplated an\r\nattack upon the Philippines. Earthworks were thrown up outside the\r\ncity wall; cannons were mounted, and the cry of invasion resounded\r\nall over the Colony. Hundreds of families fled from the capital and\r\nenvirons to adjacent provinces, and the personal safety of the German\r\nresidents was menaced by individual patriotic enthusiasts.\r\n\r\nIn Madrid, popular riots followed the publication of the incident. The\r\nGerman Embassy was assaulted, and its escutcheon was burnt in the\r\nstreets by the indignant mob, although, probably, not five per\r\ncent. of the rioters had any idea where the Caroline Islands were\r\nsituated, or anything about them. Spain acted so feebly, and Germany\r\nso vigorously, in this affair, that many asked--was it not due to\r\na secret understanding between the respective Ministries, disrupted\r\nonly by the weight of Spanish public opinion? Diplomatic notes were\r\nexchanged between Madrid and Berlin, and Germany, anxious to withdraw\r\nwith apparent dignity from an affair over which it was probably never\r\nintended to waste powder and shot, referred the question to the Pope,\r\nwho arbitrated in favour of Spain.\r\n\r\nBut for these events, it is probable that Spain would never have done\r\nanything to demonstrate possession of the Caroline Islands, and for\r\n16 months after the question was solved by Pontific mediation, there\r\nwas a Spanish Governor in Yap--Sr. Elisa--a few troops and officials,\r\nbut no Government. No laws were promulgated, and everybody continued\r\nto do as heretofore.\r\n\r\nIn Ponape (Ascencion Is.) Sr. Posadillo was appointed Governor. A\r\nfew troops were stationed there under a sub-lieutenant, whilst some\r\nCapuchin friars--European ecclesiastics of the meanest type--were\r\nsent there to compete with the American Protestant missionaries in\r\nthe salvation of natives' souls. A collision naturally took place,\r\nand the Governor--well known to all of us in Manila as crack-brained\r\nand tactless--sent the chief Protestant missionary, Mr. E. T. Doane,\r\na prisoner to Manila on June 16, 1887. [20] He was sent back free to\r\nPonape by the Gov.-General, but, during his absence, the eccentric\r\nPosadillo exercised a most arbitrary authority over the natives. The\r\nchiefs were compelled to serve him as menials, and their subjects\r\nwere formed into gangs, to work like convicts; native teachers were\r\nsuspended from their duties under threat, and the Capuchins disputed\r\nthe possession of land, and attempted to coerce the natives to accept\r\ntheir religion.\r\n\r\nOn July 1 the natives did not return to their bondage, and all the\r\nsoldiers, led by the sub-lieutenant, were sent to bring them in by\r\nforce. A fight ensued, and the officer and troops, to the last man,\r\nwere killed or mortally wounded by clubs, stones and knives. The\r\nastonished Governor fortified his place, which was surrounded by the\r\nenemy. The tribes of the chiefs Nott and Jockets were up in arms. There\r\nwas the hulk _Da. Maria de Molina_ anchored in the roadstead, and the\r\nCapuchins fled to it on the first alarm. The Governor escaped from\r\nhis house on the night of July 4 with his companions, and rushed to\r\nthe sea, probably intending to swim out to the hulk. But who knows? He\r\nand all his partisans were chased and killed by the natives.\r\n\r\nOn September 21 the news of the tragedy reached Manila by the\r\nman-o'-war _San Quintin._ About six weeks afterwards, three men-o'-war\r\nwere sent to Ponape with infantry, artillery, a mountain battery, and\r\na section of Engineers--a total of about 558 men--but on their arrival\r\nthey met an American warship--the _Essex_--which had hastened on to\r\nprotect American interests. The Spaniards limited their operations\r\nto the seizure of a few accused individuals, whom they brought to\r\nManila, and the garrison of Yap was increased to 100 men, under a\r\nCaptain and subordinate officers. The prisoners were tried in Manila\r\nby court-martial, and I acted as interpreter. It was found that they\r\nhad only been loyal to the bidding of their chiefs, and were not\r\nmorally culpable, whilst the action of the late Governor of Ponape\r\nmet with general reprobation.\r\n\r\nAgain, in July, 1890, a party of 54 soldiers, under Lieutenant Porras,\r\nwhilst engaged in felling timber in the forest, was attacked by\r\nthe Malatana (Caroline) tribe, who killed the officer and 27 of his\r\nmen. The news was telegraphed to the Home Government, and caused a\r\ngreat sensation in Madrid. A conference of Ministers was at once held,\r\nand the Canovas del Castillo Ministry cabled to the Gov.-General Weyler\r\ndiscretionary power to punish these islanders. Within a few months\r\ntroops were sent from Manila for that purpose. Instead, however,\r\nof chastising the _Kanakas_, the Government forces were repulsed\r\nby them with great slaughter. The commissariat arrangements were\r\nmost deficient: my friend Colonel Gutierrez Soto, who commanded the\r\nexpedition, was so inadequately supported by the War Department that,\r\nyielding to despair, and crestfallen by reason of the open and adverse\r\ncriticism of his plan of campaign, he shot himself.\r\n\r\nUnder the Treaty of Paris (1898) the Island of Guam (Ladrone group)\r\nwas ceded by Spain to the United States, together with the Philippine\r\nIslands. The remainder of the Ladrone group, the Caroline and the\r\nPelew Islands were sold by Spain to Germany in June, 1899.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IV\r\n\r\nAttempted Conquest by Chinese\r\n\r\n\r\nOn the death of General Legaspi, the Government of the Colony was\r\nassumed by the Royal Treasurer, Guido de Lavezares, in conformity\r\nwith the sealed instructions from the Supreme Court of Mexico, which\r\nwere now opened. During this period, the possession of the Islands\r\nwas unsuccessfully disputed by a rival expedition under the command\r\nof a Chinaman, Li-ma-hong, whom the Spaniards were pleased to term a\r\npirate, forgetting, perhaps, that they themselves had only recently\r\nwrested the country from its former possessors by virtue of might\r\nagainst right. On the coasts of his native country he had indeed been\r\na pirate. For the many depredations committed by him against private\r\ntraders and property, the Celestial Emperor, failing to catch him by\r\ncajolery, outlawed him.\r\n\r\nBorn in the port of Tiuchiu, Li-ma-hong at an early age evinced a\r\nmartial spirit and joined a band of corsairs which for a long time\r\nhad been the terror of the China coasts. On the demise of his chief\r\nhe was unanimously elected leader of the buccaneering cruisers. At\r\nlength, pursued in all directions by the imperial ships of war, he\r\ndetermined to attempt the conquest of the Philippines. Presumably\r\nthe same incentives which impelled the Spanish mariners to conquer\r\nlands and overthrow dynasties--the vision of wealth, glory and\r\nempire,--awakened a like ambition in the Chinese adventurer. It was\r\nthe spirit of the age. [21] In his sea-wanderings he happened to\r\nfall in with a Chinese trading junk returning from Manila with the\r\nproceeds of her cargo sold there. This he seized, and the captive\r\ncrew were constrained to pilot his fleet towards the capital of\r\nLuzon. From them he learnt how easily the natives had been plundered\r\nby a handful of foreigners--the probable extent of the opposition he\r\nmight encounter--the defences established--the wealth and resources\r\nof the district, and the nature of its inhabitants.\r\n\r\nHis fleet consisted of 62 war ships or armed junks, well found,\r\nhaving on board 2,000 sailors, 2,000 soldiers, 1,500 women, a number\r\nof artisans, and all that could be conveniently carried with which\r\nto gain and organize his new kingdom. On its way the squadron cast\r\nanchor off the Province of Ilocos Sur, where a few troops were sent\r\nashore to get provisions. Whilst returning to the junks, they sacked\r\nthe village and set fire to the huts. The news of this outrage was\r\nhastily communicated to Juan Salcedo, who had been pacifying the\r\nNorthern Provinces since July, 1572, and was at the time in Villa\r\nFernandina (now called Vigan). Li-ma-hong continued his course until\r\ncalms compelled his ships to anchor in the roads of Caoayan (Ilocos\r\ncoast), where a few Spanish soldiers were stationed under the orders\r\nof Juan Salcedo, who still was in the immediate town of Vigan. Under\r\nhis direction preparations were made to prevent the enemy entering the\r\nriver, but such was not Li-ma-hong's intention. He again set sail;\r\nwhilst Salcedo, naturally supposing his course would be towards\r\nManila, also started at the same time for the capital with all the\r\nfighting men he could collect, leaving only 30 men to garrison Vigan\r\nand protect the State interests there.\r\n\r\nOn November 29, 1574, the squadron arrived in the Bay of Manila,\r\nand Li-ma-hong sent forward his Lieutenant Sioco--a Japanese--at the\r\nhead of 600 fighting men to demand the surrender of the Spaniards. A\r\nstrong gale, however, destroyed several of his junks, in which about\r\n200 men perished.\r\n\r\nWith the remainder he reached the coast at Paranaque, a village seven\r\nmiles south of Manila. Thence, with tow-lines, the 400 soldiers hauled\r\ntheir junks up to the beach of the capital.\r\n\r\nAlready at the village of Malate the alarm was raised, but the\r\nSpaniards could not give credit to the reports, and no resistance was\r\noffered until the Chinese were within the gates of the city. Martin de\r\nGoiti, the _Maestre de Campo_, [22] second in command to the Governor,\r\nwas the first victim of the attack.\r\n\r\nThe flames and smoke arising from his burning residence were the\r\nfirst indications which the Governor received of what was going\r\non. The Spaniards took refuge in the Fort of Santiago, which the\r\nChinese were on the point of taking by storm, when their attention\r\nwas drawn elsewhere by the arrival of fresh troops led by a Spanish\r\nsub-lieutenant. Under the mistaken impression that these were the\r\nvanguard of a formidable corps, Sioco sounded the retreat. A bloody\r\nhand-to-hand combat followed, and with great difficulty the Chinese\r\ncollected their dead and regained their junks.\r\n\r\nIn the meantime Li-ma-hong, with the reserved forces, was lying in\r\nthe roadstead of Cavite, and Sioco hastened to report to him the\r\nresult of the attack, which had cost the invader over one hundred\r\ndead and more than that number wounded. Thereupon Li-ma-hong resolved\r\nto rest his troops and renew the conflict in two days' time under\r\nhis personal supervision. The next day Juan Salcedo arrived by sea\r\nwith reinforcements from Vigan, and preparations were unceasingly\r\nmade for the expected encounter. Salcedo having been appointed to\r\nthe office of _Maestre de Campo_, vacant since the death of Goiti,\r\nthe organization of the defence was entrusted to his immediate care.\r\n\r\nBy daybreak on December 3 the enemy's fleet hove-to off the capital,\r\nwhere Li-ma-hong harangued his troops, whilst the cornets and drums\r\nof the Spaniards were sounding the alarm for their fighting men to\r\nassemble in the fort.\r\n\r\nThen 1,500 chosen men, well armed, were disembarked under the\r\nleadership of Sioco, who swore to take the place or die in the\r\nattempt. Sioco separated his forces into three divisions. The city\r\nwas set fire to, and Sioco advanced towards the fort, into which\r\nhand-grenades were thrown, whilst Li-ma-hong supported the attack\r\nwith his ships' cannon.\r\n\r\nSioco, with his division, at length entered the fort, and a\r\nhand-to-hand fight ensued. For a while the issue was doubtful. Salcedo\r\nfought like a lion. Even the aged Governor was well to the front\r\nto encourage the deadly struggle for existence. The Spaniards\r\nfinally gained the victory; the Chinese were repulsed with great\r\nslaughter, and their leader having been killed, they fled in complete\r\ndisorder. Salcedo, profiting by the confusion, now took the offensive\r\nand followed up the enemy, pursuing them along the sea-shore,\r\nwhere they were joined by the third division, which had remained\r\ninactive. The panic of the Chinese spread rapidly, and Li-ma-hong,\r\nin despair, landed another contingent of about 500 men, whilst he\r\nstill continued afloat; but even with this reinforcement the _morale_\r\nof his army could not be restored.\r\n\r\nThe Chinese troops therefore, harassed on all sides, made a precipitate\r\nretreat on board the fleet, and Li-ma-hong set sail again for the\r\nwest coast of the island. Foiled in the attempt to possess himself\r\nof Manila, Li-ma-hong determined to set up his capital in other\r\nparts. In a few days he arrived at the mouth of the Agno River, in\r\nthe province of Pangasinan, where he proclaimed to the natives that he\r\nhad gained a signal victory over the Spaniards. The inhabitants there,\r\nhaving no particular choice between two masters, received Li-ma-hong\r\nwith welcome, and he thereupon set about the foundation of his new\r\ncapital some four miles from the mouth of the river. Months passed\r\nbefore the Spaniards came in force to dislodge the invader. Feeling\r\nthemselves secure in their new abode, the Chinese had built many\r\ndwellings, a small fortress, a pagoda, etc. At length an expedition\r\nwas despatched under the command of Juan Salcedo. This was composed\r\nof about 250 Spaniards and 1,600 natives well equipped with small\r\narms, ammunition and artillery. The flower of the Spanish Colony,\r\naccompanied by two priests and the Rajah of Tondo, set out to expel\r\nthe formidable foe. Li-ma-hong made a bold resistance, and refused to\r\ncome to terms with Salcedo. In the meantime, the Viceroy of Fokien,\r\nhaving heard of Li-ma-hong's daring exploits, had commissioned a\r\nship of war to discover the whereabouts of his imperial master's\r\nold enemy. The envoy was received with delight by the Spaniards,\r\nwho invited him to accompany them to Manila to interview the Governor.\r\n\r\nLi-ma-hong still held out, but perceiving that an irresistible\r\nonslaught was being projected against him by Salcedo's party, he\r\nvery cunningly and quite unexpectedly slipped away, and sailed out\r\nof the river with his ships by one of the mouths unknown to his\r\nenemies. [23] In order to divert the attention of the Spaniards,\r\nLi-ma-hong ingeniously feigned an assault in an opposite quarter. Of\r\ncourse, on his escape, he had to abandon the troops employed in this\r\nmanoeuvre. These, losing all hope, and having indeed nothing but\r\ntheir lives to fight for, fled to the mountains. Hence it is popularly\r\nsupposed that from these fugitives descends the race of people in the\r\nhill district north of that province still distinguishable by their\r\noblique eyes and known by the name of Igorrote-Chinese.\r\n\r\n\"_Aide-toi et Dieu t'aidera_\" is an old French maxim, but the Spaniards\r\nchose to attribute their deliverance from their Chinese rivals to\r\nthe friendly intervention of Saint Andrew. This Saint was declared\r\nthenceforth to be the Patron Saint of Manila, and in his honour High\r\nMass was celebrated in the Cathedral at 8 a.m. on the 30th of each\r\nNovember. In Spanish times it was a public holiday and gala-day, when\r\nall the highest civil, military and religious authorities attended\r\nthe _Funcion votiva de San Andres_. This opportunity to assert the\r\nsupremacy of ecclesiastical power was not lost to the Church, and for\r\nmany years it was the custom, after hearing Mass, to spread the Spanish\r\nnational flag on the floor of the Cathedral for the metropolitan\r\nArchbishop to walk over it. However, a few years prior to the Spanish\r\nevacuation the Gov.-General refused to witness this antiquated formula\r\nand it subsequently became the practice to carry the Royal Standard\r\nbefore the altar. Both before and after the Mass, the bearer (_Alferez\r\nReal_), wearing his hat and accompanied by the Mayor of the City,\r\nstood on the altar floor, raised his hat three times, and three times\r\ndipped the flag before the Image of Christ, then, facing the public,\r\nhe repeated this ceremony. On Saint Andrew's Eve the Royal Standard was\r\nborne in procession from the Cathedral through the principal streets\r\nof the city, escorted by civil functionaries and followed by a band\r\nof music. This ceremony was known as the _Paseo del Real Pendon_.\r\n\r\nAccording to Juan de la Concepcion, the Rajahs [24] Soliman and\r\nLacandola took advantage of these troubles to raise a rebellion\r\nagainst the Spaniards. The natives, too, of Mindoro Island revolted\r\nand maltreated the priests, but all these disturbances were speedily\r\nquelled by a detachment of soldiers.\r\n\r\nThe Governor willingly accepted the offer of the commander of the\r\nChinese man-o'-war to convey ambassadors to his country to visit\r\nthe Viceroy and make a commercial treaty. Therefore two priests,\r\nMartin Rada and Geronimo Martin, were commissioned to carry a letter\r\nof greeting and presents to this personage, who received them with\r\ngreat distinction, but objected to their residing in the country.\r\n\r\nAfter the defeat of Li-ma-hong, Juan Salcedo again set out to the\r\nNorthern Provinces of Luzon Island, to continue his task of reducing\r\nthe natives to submission. On March 11, 1576, he died of fever near\r\nVigan (then called Villa Fernandina), capital of the Province of\r\nIlocos Sur. A year afterwards, what could be found of his bones were\r\nplaced in the ossuary of his illustrious grandfather, Legaspi, in the\r\nAugustine Chapel of Saint Fausto, Manila. His skull, however, which had\r\nbeen carried off by the natives of Ilocos, could not be recovered in\r\nspite of all threats and promises. In Vigan there is a small monument\r\nraised to commemorate the deeds of this famous warrior, and there is\r\nalso a street bearing his name in Vigan and another in Manila.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFor several years following these events, the question of prestige\r\nin the civil affairs of the Colony was acrimoniously contested by\r\nthe Gov.-General, the Supreme Court, and the ecclesiastics.\r\n\r\nThe Governor was censured by his opponents for alleged undue exercise\r\nof arbitrary authority. The Supreme Court, established on the Mexican\r\nmodel, was reproached with seeking to overstep the limits of its\r\nfunctions. Every legal quibble was adjusted by a dilatory process,\r\nimpracticable in a colony yet in its infancy, where summary justice\r\nwas indispensable for the maintenance of order imperfectly understood\r\nby the masses. But the fault lay less with the justices than with\r\nthe constitution of the Court itself. Nor was this state of affairs\r\nimproved by the growing discontent and immoderate ambition of the\r\nclergy, who unremittingly urged their pretensions to immunity from\r\nState control, affirming the supramundane condition of their office.\r\n\r\nAn excellent code of laws, called the _Leyes de Indias_, in force\r\nin Mexico, was adopted here, but modifications in harmony with the\r\nspecial conditions of this Colony were urgently necessary, whilst all\r\nthe branches of government called for reorganization or reform. Under\r\nthese circumstances, the Bishop of Manila, Domingo Salazar, [25]\r\ntook the initiative in commissioning an Austin friar, Alonso Sanchez,\r\nto repair firstly to the Viceroy of Mexico and afterwards to the King\r\nof Spain, to expose the grievances of his party.\r\n\r\nAlonso Sanchez left the Philippines with his appointment as\r\nprocurator-general for the Augustine Order of monks. As the execution\r\nof the proposed reforms, which he was charged to lay before His\r\nMajesty, would, if conceded, be entrusted to the control of the\r\nGovernment of Mexico, his first care was to seek the partisanship\r\nof the Viceroy of that Colony; and in this he succeeded. Thence he\r\ncontinued his journey to Seville, where the Court happened to be,\r\narriving there in September, 1587. He was at once granted an audience\r\nof the King, to present his credentials and memorials relative\r\nto Philippine affairs in general, and ecclesiastical, judicial,\r\nmilitary and native matters in particular. The King promised to peruse\r\nall the documents, but suffering from gout, and having so many and\r\ndistinct State concerns to attend to, the negotiations were greatly\r\ndelayed. Finally, Alonso Sanchez sought a minister who had easy access\r\nto the royal apartments, and this personage obtained from the King\r\npermission to examine the documents and hand to him a succinct _resume_\r\nof the whole for His Majesty's consideration. A commission was then\r\nappointed, including Sanchez, and the deliberations lasted five months.\r\n\r\nAt this period, public opinion in the Spanish Universities was\r\nvery divided with respect to Catholic missions in the Indies. Some\r\nmaintained that the propaganda of the faith ought to be purely\r\nApostolic, such as Jesus Christ taught to His disciples, inculcating\r\ndoctrines of humility and poverty without arms or violence; and if,\r\nnevertheless, the heathens refused to welcome this mission of peace,\r\nthe missionaries should simply abandon them in silence without further\r\ndemonstration than that of shaking the dust off their feet.\r\n\r\nOthers held, and amongst them was Sanchez, that such a method was\r\nuseless and impracticable, and that it was justifiable to force their\r\nreligion upon primitive races at the point of the sword if necessary,\r\nusing any violence to enforce its acceptance.\r\n\r\nMuch ill-feeling was aroused in the discussion of these two and\r\ndistinct theories. Juan Volante, a Dominican friar of the Convent\r\nof Our Lady of Atocha, presented a petition against the views of the\r\nSanchez faction, declaring that the idea of ingrafting religion with\r\nthe aid of arms was scandalous. Juan Volante was so importunate that he\r\nhad to be heard in Council, but neither party yielded. At length, the\r\nintervention of the Bishops of Manila, Macao and Malacca and several\r\ncaptains and governors in the Indies influenced the King to put an\r\nend to the controversy, on the ground that it would lead to no good.\r\n\r\nThe King retired to the Monastery of the Escorial, and Sanchez was\r\ncited to meet him there to learn the royal will. About the same time\r\nthe news reached the King of the loss of the so-called Invincible\r\nArmada, sent under the command of the incompetent Duke of Medina\r\nSidonia to annex England. Notwithstanding this severe blow to the\r\nvain ambition of Philip, the affairs of the Philippines were delayed\r\nbut a short time. On the basis of the recommendation of the junta,\r\nthe Royal Assent was given to an important decree, of which the\r\nmost significant articles are the following, namely:--The tribute\r\nwas fixed by the King at ten reales (5s.) per annum, payable by the\r\nnatives in gold, silver or grain, or part in one commodity and part\r\nin the other. Of this tribute, eight reales were to be paid to the\r\nTreasury, one-half real to the bishop and clergy (_sanctorum_ tax),\r\nand one-and-a-half reales to be applied to the maintenance of the\r\nsoldiery. Full tribute was not to be exacted from the natives still\r\nunsubjected to the Crown. Until their confidence and loyalty should\r\nbe gained by friendly overtures, they were to pay a small recognition\r\nof vassalage, and subsequently the tribute in common with the rest.\r\n\r\nInstead of one-fifth value of gold and hidden treasure due to His\r\nMajesty (_real quinto_), he would thenceforth receive only one-tenth\r\nof such value, excepting that of gold, which the natives would be\r\npermitted to extract free of rebate.\r\n\r\nA customs duty of three per cent. _ad valorem_ was to be paid on\r\nmerchandise sold, and this duty was to be spent on the army.\r\n\r\nExport duty was to be paid on goods shipped to New Spain (Mexico), and\r\nthis impost was also to be exclusively spent on the armed forces. These\r\ngoods were chiefly Chinese manufactures.\r\n\r\nThe number of European troops in the Colony was fixed at 400\r\nmen-at-arms, divided into six companies, each under a captain, a\r\nsublieutenant, a sergeant, and two corporals. Their pay was to be\r\nas follows, namely:--Captain P35, sub-lieutenant P20, sergeant P10,\r\ncorporal P7, rank and file P6 per month; besides which, an annual\r\ngratuity of P10,000 was to be proportionately distributed to all.\r\n\r\nRecruits from Mexico, for military service in the Islands, were not\r\nto enlist under the age of 15 years.\r\n\r\nThe Captain-General was to have a body-guard of 24 men (Halberdiers)\r\nwith the pay of those of the line, under the immediate command of a\r\nCaptain to be paid P15 per month.\r\n\r\nSalaries due to State employees were to be punctually paid when due;\r\nand when funds were wanted for that purpose, they were to be supplied\r\nfrom Mexico.\r\n\r\nThe King made a donation of P12,000, which, with another like sum to\r\nbe contributed by the Spaniards themselves, would serve to liquidate\r\ntheir debts incurred on their first occupation of the Islands.\r\n\r\nThe Governor and Bishop were recommended to consider the project\r\nof a refuge for young Spanish women arrived from Spain and Mexico,\r\nand to study the question of dowries for native women married to\r\npoor Spaniards.\r\n\r\nThe offices of Secretaries and Notaries were no longer to be sold,\r\nbut conferred on persons who merited such appointments.\r\n\r\nThe governors were instructed not to make grants of land to their\r\nrelations, servants or friends, but solely to those who should have\r\nresided at least three years in the Islands, and have worked the\r\nlands so conceded. Any grants which might have already been made to\r\nthe relations of the governors or magistrates were to be cancelled.\r\n\r\nThe rent paid by the Chinese for the land they occupied was to be\r\napplied to the necessities of the capital.\r\n\r\nThe Governor and Bishop were to enjoin the judges not to permit\r\ncostly lawsuits, but to execute summary justice verbally, and so far\r\nas possible, fines were not to be inflicted.\r\n\r\nThe City of Manila was to be fortified in a manner to ensure it\r\nagainst all further attacks or risings.\r\n\r\nFour penitentiaries were to be established in the Islands in the most\r\nconvenient places, with the necessary garrisons, and six to eight\r\ngalleys and frigates well armed and ready for defence against the\r\nEnglish corsairs who might come by way of the Moluccas.\r\n\r\nIn the most remote and unexplored parts of the Islands, the Governor\r\nwas to have unlimited powers to act as he should please, without\r\nconsulting His Majesty; but projected enterprises of conversion,\r\npacification, etc., at the expense of the Royal Treasury, were to be\r\nsubmitted to a Council comprising the Bishop, the captains, etc. The\r\nGovernor was authorized to capitulate and agree with the captain and\r\nothers who might care to undertake conversions and pacifications on\r\ntheir own account, and to concede the title of _Maestre de Campo_\r\nto such persons, on condition that such capitulations should be\r\nforwarded to His Majesty for ratification.\r\n\r\nOnly those persons domiciled in the Islands would be permitted to\r\ntrade with them.\r\n\r\nA sum of P1,000 was to be taken from the tributes paid into the Royal\r\nTreasury for the foundation of the Hospital for the Spaniards, and\r\nthe annual sum of P600, appropriated by the Governor for its support,\r\nwas confirmed. Moreover, the Royal Treasury of Mexico was to send\r\nclothing to the value of 400 ducats for the Hospital use.\r\n\r\nThe Hospital for the natives was to receive an annual donation of P600\r\nfor its support, and an immediate supply of clothing from Mexico to\r\nthe value of P200.\r\n\r\nSlaves held by the Spaniards were to be immediately set at liberty. No\r\nnative was thenceforth to make slaves. All new-born natives were\r\ndeclared free. The bondage of all existing slaves from ten years\r\nof age was to cease on their attaining twenty years of age. Those\r\nabove twenty years of age were to serve five years longer, and then\r\nbecome free. At any time, notwithstanding the foregoing conditions,\r\nthey would be entitled to purchase their liberty, the price of which\r\nwas to be determined by the Governor and the Bishop. [26]\r\n\r\nThere being no tithes payable to the Church by Spaniards or natives,\r\nthe clergy were to receive for their maintenance the half-real above\r\nmentioned in lieu thereof, from the tribute paid by each native\r\nsubjected to the Crown. When the Spaniards should have crops, they\r\nwere to pay tithes to the clergy (_diezmos prediales_).\r\n\r\nA grant was made of 12,000 ducats for the building and ornaments of\r\nthe Cathedral of Manila, and an immediate advance of 2,000 ducats\r\non account of this grant was made from the funds to be remitted\r\nfrom Mexico.\r\n\r\nForty Austin friars were to be sent at once to the Philippines, to be\r\nfollowed by missionaries from other corporations. The King allowed\r\nP500 to be paid against the P1,000 passage money for each priest,\r\nthe balance to be defrayed out of the common funds of the clergy,\r\nderived from their share of the tribute.\r\n\r\nMissionaries in great numbers had already flocked to the Philippines\r\nand roamed wherever they thought fit, without licence from the Bishop,\r\nwhose authority they utterly repudiated.\r\n\r\nAffirming that they had the direct consent of His Holiness the Pope,\r\nthey menaced with excommunication whosoever attempted to impede\r\nthem in their free peregrination. Five years after the foundation of\r\nManila, the city and environs were infested with niggardly mendicant\r\nfriars, whose slothful habits placed their supercilious countrymen\r\nin ridicule before the natives. They were tolerated but a short time\r\nin the Islands; not altogether because of the ruin they would have\r\nbrought to European moral influence on the untutored tribes, but\r\nbecause the Bishop was highly jealous of all competition against the\r\nAugustine Order which he assisted. Consequent on the representations\r\nof Alonso Sanchez, His Majesty ordained that all priests who went to\r\nthe Philippines were, in the first place, to resolve never to quit the\r\nIslands without the Bishop's sanction, which was to be conceded with\r\ngreat circumspection and only in extreme cases, whilst the Governor\r\nwas instructed not to afford them means of exit on his sole authority.\r\n\r\nNeither did the Bishop regard with satisfaction the presence of the\r\nCommissary of the Inquisition, whose secret investigations, shrouded\r\nwith mystery, curtailed the liberty of the loftiest functionary, sacred\r\nor civil. At the instigation of Alonso Sanchez, the junta recommended\r\nthe King to recall the Commissary and extinguish the office, but\r\nhe refused to do so. In short, the chief aims of the Bishop were to\r\nenhance the power of the friars, raise the dignity of the Colonial\r\nmitre, and secure a religious monopoly for the Augustine Order.\r\n\r\nGomez Perez Dasmarinas was the next Governor appointed to these\r\nIslands, on the recommendation of Alonso Sanchez. In the Royal\r\nInstructions which he brought with him were embodied all the\r\nabove-mentioned civil, ecclesiastical and military reforms. At\r\nthe same time, King Philip abolished the Supreme Court. He wished\r\nto put an end to the interminable lawsuits so prejudicial to the\r\ndevelopment of the Colony. Therefore the President and Magistrates\r\nwere replaced by Justices of the Peace, and the former returned to\r\nMexico in 1591. This measure served only to widen the breach between\r\nthe Bishop and the Civil Government. Dasmarinas compelled him to\r\nkeep within the sphere of his sacerdotal functions, and tolerated no\r\nrival in State concerns. There was no appeal on the spot against the\r\nGovernor's authority. This restraint irritated and disgusted the Bishop\r\nto such a degree that, at the age of 78 years, he resolved to present\r\nhimself at the Spanish Court. On his arrival there, he explained to\r\nthe King the impossibility of one Bishop attending to the spiritual\r\nwants of a people dispersed over so many Islands. For seven years after\r\nthe foundation of Manila as capital of the Archipelago, its principal\r\nchurch was simply a parish church. In 1578 it was raised to the dignity\r\nof a Cathedral, at the instance of the King. Three years after this\r\ndate the Cathedral of Manila was solemnly declared to be a \"Suffragan\r\nCathedral of Mexico, under the advocation of Our Lady of the Immaculate\r\nConception\"; Domingo Salazar being the first Bishop consecrated. He\r\nnow proposed to raise the Manila See to an Archbishopric, with three\r\nSuffragan Bishops. The King gave his consent, subject to approval\r\nfrom Rome, and this following in due course, Salazar was appointed\r\nfirst Archbishop of Manila, but he died before the Papal Bull arrived,\r\ndated August 14, 1595, officially authorizing his investiture.\r\n\r\nIn the meantime, Alonso Sanchez had proceeded to Rome in May,\r\n1589. Amongst many other Pontifical favours conceded to him, he\r\nobtained the right for himself, or his assigns, to use a die or stamp\r\nof any form with one or more images, to be chosen by the holder, and\r\nto contain also the figure of Christ, the Very Holy Virgin, or the\r\nSaints Peter or Paul. On the reverse was to be engraven a bust portrait\r\nof His Holiness, with the following indulgences attached thereto,\r\nviz.:--\"To him who should convey the word of God to the infidels,\r\nor give them notice of the holy mysteries--each time 300 years'\r\nindulgence. To him who, by industry, converted any one of these,\r\nor brought him to the bosom of the Church--full indulgence for all\r\nsins.\" A number of minor indulgences were conceded for services to\r\nbe rendered to the Pontificate, and for the praying so many Pater\r\nNosters and Ave Marias. This Bull was dated in Rome July 28, 1591.\r\n\r\nPopes Gregory XIV. and Innocent IX. granted other Bulls relating to the\r\nrewards for using beads, medals, crosses, pictures, blessed images,\r\netc., with which one could gain nine plenary indulgences every day\r\nor rescue nine souls from purgatory; and each day, twice over, all\r\nthe full indulgences yet given in and out of Rome could be obtained\r\nfor living and deceased persons.\r\n\r\nSanchez returned to Spain (where he died), bringing with him the\r\nbody of Saint Policarp, relics of Saint Potenciana, and 157 Marytrs;\r\namongst them, 27 popes, for remission to the Cathedral of Manila.\r\n\r\nThe Supreme Court was re-established with the same faculties as\r\nthose of Mexico and Lima in 1598, and since then, on seven occasions,\r\nwhen the Governorship has been vacant, it has acted _pro tem_. The\r\nfollowing interesting account of the pompous ceremonial attending\r\nthe reception of the Royal Seal, restoring this Court, is given by\r\nConcepcion. [27] He says:--\"The Royal Seal of office was received\r\nfrom the ship with the accustomed solemnity. It was contained in a\r\nchest covered with purple velvet and trimmings of silver and gold,\r\nover which hung a cloth of silver and gold. It was escorted by\r\na majestic accompaniment, marching to the sounds of clarions and\r\ncymbals and other musical instruments. The _cortege_ passed through\r\nthe noble city with rich vestments, with leg trimmings and uncovered\r\nheads. Behind these followed a horse, gorgeously caparisoned and\r\ngirthed, upon whose back the President placed the coffer containing\r\nthe Royal Seal. The streets were beautifully adorned with exquisite\r\ndrapery. The High Bailiff, magnificently robed, took the reins in\r\nhand to lead the horse under a purple velvet pall, bordered with\r\ngold. The magistrates walked on either side; the aldermen of the city,\r\nrichly clad, carried their staves of office in the august procession,\r\nwhich concluded with a military escort, standard bearers, etc., and\r\nproceeded to the Cathedral, where it was met by the Dean, holding\r\na Cross. As the company entered the sacred edifice, the Te Deum was\r\nintoned by a band of music.\"\r\n\r\nIn 1886 a Supreme Court, exactly similar to, and independent of,\r\nthat of Manila, was established in the City of Cebu. The question of\r\nprecedence in official acts having been soon after disputed between\r\nthe President of the Court and the Brigadier-Governor of Visayas, it\r\nwas decided in favour of the latter, on appeal to the Gov.-General. In\r\nthe meantime, the advisability of abolishing the Supreme Court of Cebu,\r\nwas warmly debated by the public.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFor many years after the conquest, deep religious sentiment pervaded\r\nthe State policy, and not a few of the Governors-General acquired\r\nfame for their demonstrations of piety. Nevertheless, the conflictive\r\nambition of the State and Church representatives was a powerful\r\nhindrance to the progress of the Colony.\r\n\r\nThe quarrel between Sebastian Hurtado de Corcuera (1635-44) and\r\nthe Archbishop arose from a circumstance of little concern to the\r\nColony. The Archbishop ordered a military officer, who had a slave,\r\neither to sell or liberate her. The officer, rather than yield\r\nto either condition, wished to marry her, but failing to obtain\r\nher consent, he stabbed her to death. He thereupon took asylum in a\r\nconvent, whence he was forcibly removed, and publicly executed in front\r\nof Saint Augustine's Church by order of the Governor. The Archbishop\r\nprotested against the act, which, in those days, was qualified as a\r\nviolation of sanctuary.\r\n\r\nThe churches were closed whilst the dispute lasted. The Jesuits,\r\nalways opposed to the Austin friars, sided with the Governor. The\r\nArchbishop therefore prohibited them to preach outside their churches\r\nin any public place, under pain of excommunication and 4,000 ducats\r\nfine, whilst the other priests agreed to abstain from attending their\r\nreligious or literary _reunions_. Finally, a religious council was\r\ncalled, but a coalition having been formed against the Archbishop,\r\nhe was excommunicated--his goods distrained--his salary stopped,\r\nand he was suspended in his archiepiscopal functions under a penalty\r\nof 4,000 ducats fine. At this crisis, he implored mercy and the\r\nintervention of the Supreme Court. The magistrates decided against the\r\nprelate's appeal, and allowed him twelve hours to comply, under pain\r\nof continued excommunication and a further fine of 1,000 ducats. The\r\nArchbishop thereupon retired to the Convent of Saint Francis, where\r\nthe Governor visited him. The Archbishop subsequently made the most\r\nabject submission in an archiepiscopal decree which fully sets forth\r\nthe admission of his guilt. Such a violent settlement of disputes\r\ndid not long remain undisturbed, and the Archbishop again sought the\r\nfirst opportunity of opposing the lay authority. In this he can only be\r\nexcused--if excuse it be--as the upholder of the traditions of cordial\r\ndiscord between the two great factions--Church and State. The Supreme\r\nCourt, under the presidency of the Governor, resolved therefore to\r\nbanish the Archbishop from Manila. With this object, 50 soldiers\r\nwere deputed to seize the prelate, who was secretly forewarned of\r\ntheir coming by his co-conspirators. On their approach he held the\r\nHost in his hand, and it is related that the sub-lieutenant sent in\r\ncharge of the troops was so horrified at his mission that he placed\r\nthe hilt of his sword upon the floor and fell upon the point, but as\r\nthe sword bent he did not kill himself. The soldiers waited patiently\r\nuntil the Archbishop was tired out and compelled, by fatigue, to\r\nreplace the Host on the altar. Then they immediately arrested him,\r\nconducted him to a boat under a guard of five men, and landed him on\r\nthe desert Island of Corregidor. The churches were at once reopened;\r\nthe Jesuits preached where they chose; terms were dictated to the\r\ncontumacious Archbishop, who accepted everything unconditionally,\r\nand was thereupon permitted to resume his office. The acts of Corcuera\r\nwere inquired into by his successor, who caused him to be imprisoned\r\nfor five years; but it is to be presumed that Corcuera was justified\r\nin what he did, for on his release and return to Spain, the King\r\nrewarded him with the Governorship of the Canary Islands.\r\n\r\nIt is chronicled that Sabiniano Manrique de Lara (1653-63), who\r\narrived in the galleon _San Francisco Xavier_ with the Archbishop\r\nPoblete, refused to disembark until this dignitary had blessed the\r\nearth he was going to tread. It was he too who had the privilege of\r\nwitnessing the expurgation of the Islands of the excommunications\r\nand admonitions of Rome. The Archbishop brought peace and goodwill\r\nto all men, being charged by His Holiness to sanctify the Colony.\r\n\r\nThe ceremony was performed with great solemnity, from an elevation,\r\nin the presence of an immense concourse of people. Later on, the\r\npious Governor Lara was accused of perfidy to his royal master,\r\nand was fined P60,000, but on being pardoned, he retired to Spain,\r\nwhere he took holy orders.\r\n\r\nHis successor, Diego Salcedo (1663-68), was not so fortunate in his\r\nrelations with Archbishop Poblete, for during five years he warmly\r\ncontested his intervention in civil affairs. Poblete found it hard to\r\nyield the exercise of veto in all matters which, by courtesy, had been\r\nconceded to him by the late Governor Lara. The Archbishop refused to\r\nobey the Royal Decrees relating to Church appointments under the Royal\r\npatronage, such preferments being in the hands of the Gov.-General as\r\nvice-royal patron. These decrees were twice notified to the Archbishop,\r\nbut as he still persisted in his disobedience, Salcedo signed an\r\norder for his expulsion to Mariveles. This brought the prelate to his\r\nsenses, and he remained more submissive in future. It is recorded\r\nthat the relations between the Governor and the Archbishop became\r\nso strained that the latter was compelled to pay a heavy fine--to\r\nremain standing whilst awaiting an audience--to submit to contumely\r\nduring the interviews--and when he died, the Governor ordered royal\r\nfeasts to celebrate the joyful event, whilst he prohibited the _de\r\nprofundis_ Mass, on the ground that such would be inconsistent with\r\nthe secular festivities.\r\n\r\nThe King, on being apprised of this, permitted the Inquisition to\r\ntake its course. Diego Salcedo was surprised in his Palace, and\r\nimprisoned by the bloodthirsty agents of the _Santo Oficio_. Some\r\nyears afterwards, he was shipped on board a galleon as a prisoner to\r\nthe Inquisitors of Mexico, but the ship had to put back under stress\r\nof weather, and Salcedo returned to his dungeon. There he suffered\r\nthe worst privations, until he was again embarked for Mexico. On this\r\nvoyage he died of grief and melancholy. The King espoused the cause\r\nof the ecclesiastics, and ordered Salcedo's goods, as well as those\r\nof his partisans, to be confiscated.\r\n\r\nManuel de Leon (1669-77) managed to preserve a good understanding with\r\nthe clergy, and, on his decease, he bequeathed all his possessions\r\nto the Obras Pias (q.v.).\r\n\r\nTroubles with the Archbishop and friars were revived on the Government\r\nbeing assumed by Juan de Nargas (1678-84). In the last year of\r\nhis rule, the Archbishop was banished from Manila. It is difficult\r\nto adequately appreciate the causes of this quarrel, and there is\r\ndoubt as to which was right--the Governor or the Archbishop. On his\r\nrestoration to his See, he was one of the few prelates--perhaps the\r\nonly one--who personally sought to avenge himself. During the dispute,\r\na number of friars had supported the Government, and these he caused\r\nto stand on a raised platform in front of a church, and publicly recant\r\ntheir former acts, declaring themselves miscreants. Juan de Nargas had\r\njust retired from the Governorship after seven years' service, and the\r\nArchbishop called upon him likewise to abjure his past proceedings and\r\nperform the following penance:--To wear a penitent's garb--to place a\r\nrope around his neck, and carry a lighted candle to the doors of the\r\ncathedral and the churches of the Parian, San Gabriel and Binondo,\r\non every feast day during four months. Nargas objected to this\r\ndegradation, and claimed privilege, arguing that the Archbishop had\r\nno jurisdiction over him, as he was a Cavalier of the Military Order\r\nof St. James. But the Archbishop only desisted in his pretensions to\r\nhumiliate Nargas when the new Governor threatened to expel him again.\r\n\r\nFernando Bustamente Bustillo y Rueda (1717-19) adopted very\r\nstringent measures to counteract the Archbishop's excessive claims to\r\nimmunity. Several individuals charged with heinous crimes had taken\r\nchurch asylum and defied the civil power and justice. The Archbishop\r\nwas appealed to, to hand them over to the civil authorities, or allow\r\nthem to be taken. He refused to do either, supporting the claim of\r\nimmunity of sanctuary. At the same time it came to the knowledge of\r\nthe Governor that a movement had been set on foot against him by those\r\ncitizens who favoured the Archbishop's views, and that even the friars\r\nhad so debased themselves as to seek the aid of the Chinese residents\r\nagainst the Governor. Jose Torralba (q.v.), the late acting-Governor,\r\nwas released from confinement by the Governor, and reinstated by him\r\nas judge in the Supreme Court, although he was under an accusation of\r\nembezzlement to the extent of P700,000. The Archbishop energetically\r\nopposed this act. He notified to Torralba his excommunication and\r\necclesiastical pains, and, on his own authority, attempted to seize his\r\nperson in violation of the privileges of the Supreme Court. Torralba,\r\nwith his sword and shield in hand, expelled the Archbishop's messenger\r\nby force. Then, as judge in the Supreme Court, he hastened to avenge\r\nhimself of his enemies by issuing warrants against them. They fled to\r\nChurch asylum, and, with the moral support of the Archbishop, laughed\r\nat the magistrates. There the refugees provided themselves with arms,\r\nand prepared for rebellion. When the Archbishop was officially informed\r\nof these facts, he still maintained that nothing could violate their\r\nimmunity. The Governor then caused the Archbishop to be arrested and\r\nconfined in a fortress, with all the ecclesiastics who had taken an\r\nactive part in the conspiracy against the Government.\r\n\r\nOpen riot ensued, and the priests marched to the Palace, amidst\r\nhideous clamourings, collecting the mob and citizens on the way. It was\r\none of the most revolting scenes and remarkable events in Philippine\r\nhistory. Priests of the Sacred Orders of Saint Francis, Saint Dominic,\r\nand Saint Augustine joined the Recoletos in shouting \"Viva la Iglesia,\"\r\n\"Viva nuestro Rey Don Felipe Quinto.\" [28] The excited rabble rushed\r\nto the Palace, and the Guard having fled, they easily forced their\r\nway in. One priest who impudently dared to advance towards the\r\nGovernor, was promptly ordered by him to stand back. The Governor,\r\nseeing himself encircled by an armed mob of laymen and servants of\r\nChrist clamouring for his downfall, pulled the trigger of his gun,\r\nbut the flint failed to strike fire. Then the crowd took courage\r\nand attacked him, whilst he defended himself bravely with a bayonet,\r\nuntil he was overwhelmed by numbers. From the Palace he was dragged\r\nto the common jail, and stabbed and maltreated on the way. His son,\r\nhearing of this outrage, arrived on horseback, but was run through\r\nby one of the rebels, and fell to the ground. He got up and tried to\r\ncut his way through the infuriated rioters, but was soon surrounded\r\nand killed, and his body horribly mutilated.\r\n\r\nThe populace, urged by the clerical party, now fought for the\r\nliberty of the Archbishop. The prison doors were broken open, and the\r\nArchbishop was amongst the number of offenders liberated. The prelate\r\ncame in triumph to the Palace, and assumed the Government in October,\r\n1719. The mob, during their excesses, tore down the Royal Standard,\r\nand maltreated those whom they met of the unfortunate Governor's\r\nfaithful friends. A mock inquiry into the circumstances of the riot\r\nwas made in Manila in apparent judicial form. Another investigation\r\nwas instituted in Mexico, which led to several of the minor actors in\r\nthis sad drama being made the scapegoat victims of the more exalted\r\ncriminals. The Archbishop held the Government for nine years, and\r\nwas then transferred to the Mexican Bishopric of Mechoacan.\r\n\r\nPedro Manuel de Arandia (1754-59) is said to have expired of\r\nmelancholy, consequent, in a measure, on his futile endeavours to\r\ngovern at peace with the friars, who always secured the favour of\r\nthe King.\r\n\r\nOn four occasions the Supreme State authority in the Colony has been\r\nvested in the prelates. Archbishop Manuel Rojo, acting-Governor at\r\nthe time of the British occupation of Manila in 1763, is said to\r\nhave died of grief and shame in prison (1764) through the intrigues\r\nof the violent Simon de Anda y Salazar (q.v.).\r\n\r\nJose Raon was Gov.-General in 1768, when the expulsion of the Jesuits\r\nwas decreed. After the secret determination was made known to him,\r\nhe was accused of having divulged it, and of having concealed his\r\ninstructions. He was thereupon placed under guard in his own residence,\r\nwhere he expired (_vide_ Simon de Anda y Salazar).\r\n\r\nDomingo Moriones y Murillo (1877-80), it is alleged, had grave\r\naltercations with the friars, and found it necessary to remind the\r\nArchbishop Payo that the supreme power in the Philippines belonged\r\nto the State--not to the Church representative.\r\n\r\nFrom the earliest times of Spanish dominion, it had been the practice\r\nof the natives to expose to view the corpses of their relations\r\nand friends in the public highways and villages whilst conveying\r\nthem to the parish churches, where they were again exhibited to the\r\ncommon gaze, pending the pleasure of the parish priest to perform the\r\nlast obsequies. This outrage on public decorum was proscribed by the\r\nDirector-General of Civil Administration in a circular dated October,\r\n18, 1887, addressed to the Provincial Governors, enjoining them to\r\nprohibit such indecent scenes in future. Thereupon the parish priests\r\nsimply showed their contempt for the civil authorities by simulating\r\ntheir inability to elucidate to the native petty governors the true\r\nintent and meaning of the order. At the same time, the Archbishop\r\nof Manila issued instructions on the subject to his subordinates\r\nin very equivocal language. The native local authorities then\r\npetitioned the Civil Governor of Manila to make the matter clear to\r\nthem. The Civil Governor forthwith referred the matter back to the\r\nDirector-General of Civil Administration. This functionary, in a new\r\ncircular dated November 4, confirmed his previous mandate of October\r\n18, and censured the action of the parish priests, who \"in improper\r\nlanguage and from the pulpit,\" had incited the native headmen to set\r\naside his authority. The author of the circular sarcastically added\r\nthe pregnant remark, that he was penetrated with the conviction that\r\nthe Archbishop's sense of patriotism and rectitude _would deter him\r\nfrom subverting the law_. This incident seriously aroused the jealousy\r\nof the friars holding vicarages, and did not improve the relations\r\nbetween Church and State.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER V\r\n\r\nEarly Relations With Japan\r\n\r\n\r\nTwo decades of existence in the 16th century was but a short period\r\nin which to make known the conditions of this new Colony to its\r\nneighbouring States, when its only regular intercourse with them was\r\nthrough the Chinese who came to trade with Manila. Japanese mariners,\r\ntherefore, appear to have continued to regard the north of Luzon\r\nas \"no-man's-land\"; for years after its nominal annexation by the\r\nSpaniards they assembled there, whether as merchants or buccaneers\r\nit is difficult to determine. Spanish authority had been asserted by\r\nSalcedo along the west coast about as far as lat. 18 deg. N., but in 1591\r\nthe north coast was only known to Europeans geographically. So far,\r\nthe natives there had not made the acquaintance of their new masters.\r\n\r\nA large Spanish galley cruising in these waters met a Japanese vessel\r\noff Cape Bojeador (N.W. point), and fired a shot which carried away the\r\nstranger's mainmast, obliging him to heave-to. Then the galley-men,\r\nintending to board the stranger, made fast the sterns, whilst the\r\nSpaniards rushed to the bows; but the Japanese came first, boarded\r\nthe galley, and drove the Spaniards aft, where they would have all\r\nperished had they not cut away the mizzenmast and let it fall with all\r\nsail set. Behind this barricade they had time to load their arquebuses\r\nand drive back the Japanese, over whom they gained a victory. The\r\nSpaniards then entered the Rio Grande de Cagayan, where they met a\r\nJapanese fleet, between which they passed peacefully. On shore they\r\nformed trenches and mounted cannons on earthworks, but the Japanese\r\nscaled the fortifications and pulled down the cannons by the mouths.\r\n\r\nThese were recovered, and the Spanish captain had the cannon mouths\r\ngreased, so that the Japanese tactics should not be repeated. A\r\nbattle was fought and the defeated Japanese set sail, whilst the\r\nSpaniards remained to obtain the submission of the natives by force\r\nor by persuasion.\r\n\r\nThe Japanese had also come to Manila to trade, and were located in\r\nthe neighbouring village of Dilao, [29] where the Franciscan friars\r\nundertook their conversion to Christianity, whilst the Dominican Order\r\nconsidered the spiritual care of the Chinese their especial charge.\r\n\r\nThe Portuguese had been in possession of Macao since the year 1557,\r\nand traded with various Chinese ports, whilst in the Japanese town\r\nof Nagasaki there was a small colony of Portuguese merchants. These\r\nwere the indirect sources whence the Emperor of Japan learnt that\r\nEuropeans had founded a colony in Luzon Island; and in 1593 he sent\r\na message to the Governor of the Philippines calling upon him to\r\nsurrender and become his vassal, threatening invasion in the event of\r\nrefusal. The Spanish colonies at that date were hardly in a position\r\nto treat with haughty scorn the menaces of the Japanese potentate,\r\nfor they were simultaneously threatened with troubles with the Dutch\r\nin the Moluccas, for which they were preparing an armament (_vide_\r\nChap. vi.). The want of men, ships, and war material obliged them\r\nto seek conciliation with dignity. The Japanese Ambassador, Farranda\r\nKiemon, was received with great honours and treated with the utmost\r\ndeference during his sojourn in Manila.\r\n\r\nThe Governor replied to the Emperor, that being but a lieger of the\r\nKing of Spain--a mighty monarch of unlimited resources and power--he\r\nwas unable to acknowledge the Emperor's suzerainty; for the most\r\nimportant duty imposed upon him by his Sovereign was the defence of\r\nhis vast domains against foreign aggression; that, on the other hand,\r\nhe was desirous of entering into amicable and mutually advantageous\r\nrelations with the Emperor, and solicited his conformity to a treaty\r\nof commerce, the terms of which would be elucidated to him by an envoy.\r\n\r\nA priest, Juan Cobo, and an infantry captain were thereupon accredited\r\nto the Japanese Court as Philippine Ambassadors. On their arrival\r\nthey were, without delay, admitted in audience by the Emperor; the\r\ntreaty of commerce was adjusted to the satisfaction of both parties;\r\nand the Ambassadors, with some Japanese nobles, set sail for Manila\r\nin Japanese ships, which foundered on the voyage, and all perished.\r\n\r\nNeither the political nor the clerical party in Manila was, however,\r\ndismayed by this first disaster, and the prospect of penetrating\r\nJapan was followed up by a second expedition.\r\n\r\nBetween the friars an animated discussion arose when the Jesuits\r\nprotested against members of any other Order being sent to Japan. Saint\r\nFrancis Xavier had, years before, obtained a Papal Bull from Pope\r\nGregory XIII., awarding Japan to his Order, which had been the first to\r\nestablish missions in Nagasaki. Jesuits were still there in numbers,\r\nand the necessity of sending members of rival religious bodies is not\r\nmade clear in the historical records. The jealous feud between those\r\nholy men was referred to the Governor, who naturally decided against\r\nthe Jesuits, in support of the King's policy of grasping territory\r\nunder the cloak of piety. A certain Fray Pedro Bautista was chosen as\r\nAmbassador, and in his suite were three other priests. These embarked\r\nin a Spanish frigate, whilst Farranda Kiemon, who had remained in\r\nManila the honoured guest of the Government, took his leave, and went\r\non board his own vessel. The authorities bade farewell to the two\r\nembassies with ostentatious ceremonies, and amidst public rejoicings\r\nthe two ships started on their journey on May 26, 1593. After 30 days'\r\nnavigation one ship arrived safely at Nagasaki, and the other at a\r\nport 35 miles further along the coast.\r\n\r\nPedro Bautista, introduced by Ferranda Kiemon, was presented to\r\nthe Emperor Taycosama, who welcomed him as an Ambassador authorized\r\nto _negotiate a treaty of commerce, and conclude an offensive and\r\ndefensive alliance for mutual protection._ The Protocol was agreed\r\nto and signed by both parties, and the relations between the Emperor\r\nand Pedro Bautista became more and more cordial. The latter solicited,\r\nand obtained, permission to reside indefinitely in the country and send\r\nthe treaty on by messenger to the Governor of the Philippines; hence\r\nthe ships in which the envoys had arrived remained about ten months in\r\nport. A concession was also granted to build a church at Meaco, near\r\nOsaka, and it was opened in 1594, when Mass was publicly celebrated.\r\n\r\nIn Nagasaki the Jesuits were allowed to reside unmolested and practise\r\ntheir religious rites amongst the Portuguese population of traders\r\nand others who might have voluntarily embraced Christianity. Bautista\r\nwent there to consult with the chief of the Jesuit Mission, who\r\nenergetically opposed what he held to be an encroachment upon the\r\nmonopoly rights of his Order, conceded by Pope Gregory XIII. and\r\nconfirmed by royal decrees. Bautista, however, showed a permission\r\nwhich he had received from the Jesuit General, by virtue of which he\r\nwas suffered to continue his course pending that dignitary's arrival.\r\n\r\nThe Portuguese merchants in Nagasaki were not slow to comprehend that\r\nBautista's coming with priests at his command was but a prelude to\r\nSpanish territorial conquest, which would naturally retard their\r\nhoped-for emancipation from the Spanish yoke. [30] Therefore,\r\nin their own interests, they forewarned the Governor of Nagasaki,\r\nwho prohibited Bautista from continuing his propaganda against the\r\nestablished religion of the country in contravention of the Emperor's\r\ncommands; but as Bautista took no heed of this injunction, he was\r\nexpelled from Nagasaki for contumacy.\r\n\r\nIt was now manifest to the Emperor that he had been basely deceived,\r\nand that under the pretext of concluding a commercial and political\r\ntreaty, Bautista and his party had, in effect, introduced themselves\r\ninto his realm with the clandestine object of seducing his subjects\r\nfrom their allegiance, of undermining their consciences, perverting\r\nthem from the religion of their forefathers, and that all this would\r\nbring about the dismemberment of his Empire and the overthrow of his\r\ndynasty. Not only had Taycosama abstained from persecuting foreigners\r\nfor the exercise of their religious rites, but he freely licensed the\r\nJesuits to continue their mission in Nagasaki and wherever Catholics\r\nhappened to congregate. He had permitted the construction of their\r\ntemples, but he could not tolerate a deliberate propaganda which\r\nforeshadowed his own ruin. [31]\r\n\r\nPedro Bautista's designs being prematurely obstructed, he took his\r\npassage back to Manila from Nagasaki in a Japanese vessel, leaving\r\nbehind him his interpreter, Fray Jerome, with the other Franciscan\r\nmonks. An Imperial Decree was then issued to prohibit foreign priests\r\nfrom interfering with the religion of Japanese subjects; but this law\r\nhaving been set at naught by Bautista's colleagues, one was arrested\r\nand imprisoned, and warrants were issued against the others; meanwhile\r\nthe Jesuits in Nagasaki were in no way restrained.\r\n\r\nThe Governor of Nagasaki caused the Franciscan propagandists to be\r\nconducted on board a Portuguese ship and handed over to the charge\r\nof the captain, under severe penalties if he aided or allowed their\r\nescape, but they were free to go wherever they chose outside the\r\nJapanese Empire. The captain, however, permitted one to return ashore,\r\nand for some time he wandered about the country in disguise.\r\n\r\nPedro Bautista had reached Manila, where the ecclesiastical dignitaries\r\nprevailed upon the Governor to sanction another expedition to Japan,\r\nand Bautista arrived in that country a second time with a number of\r\nFranciscan friars. The Emperor now lost all patience, and determined\r\nnot only to repress these venturesome foreigners, but to stamp out\r\nthe last vestige of their revolutionary machinations. Therefore, by\r\nImperial Decree, the arrest was ordered of all the Franciscan friars,\r\nand all natives who persisted in their adhesion to these missionaries'\r\nteachings. Twenty-six of those taken were tried and condemned to\r\nignominious exhibition and death--the Spaniards, because they had come\r\ninto the country and had received royal favours under false pretences,\r\nrepresenting themselves as political ambassadors and suite--the\r\nJapanese, because they had forsworn the religion of their ancestors\r\nand bid fair to become a constant danger and source of discord in the\r\nrealm. Amongst these Spaniards was Pedro Bautista. After their ears\r\nand noses had been cut off, they were promenaded from town to town\r\nin a cart, finally entering Nagasaki on horseback, each bearing the\r\nsentence of death on a breast-board.\r\n\r\nOn a high ground, near the city and the port, in front of the Jesuits'\r\nchurch, these 26 persons were crucified and stabbed to death with\r\nlances, in expiation of their political offences. It was a sad fate for\r\nmen who conscientiously believed that they were justified in violating\r\nrights and laws of nations for the propagation of their particular\r\nviews; but can one complain? Would Buddhist missionaries in Spain\r\nhave met with milder treatment at the hands of the Inquisitors? [32]\r\n\r\nEach Catholic body was supposed to designate the same road to\r\nheaven--each professed to teach the same means of obtaining the\r\ngrace of God; yet, strange to say, each bore the other an implacable\r\nhatred--an inextinguishable jealousy! If conversion to Christianity\r\nwere for the glory of God only, what could it have mattered whether\r\nsouls of Japanese were saved by Jesuits or by others? For King Philip\r\nit was the same whether his political tools were of one denomination or\r\nthe other, but many of the Jesuits in Japan happened to be Portuguese.\r\n\r\nThe Jesuits in Manila probably felt that in view of their opposition\r\nto the Franciscan missions, public opinion might hold them morally\r\nresponsible for indirectly contributing to the unfortunate events\r\nrelated; therefore, to justify their acts, they formally declared\r\nthat Pedro Bautista and his followers died excommunicated, because\r\nthey had disobeyed the Bull of Pope Gregory XIII.\r\n\r\nThe general public were much excited when the news spread through\r\nthe city, and a special Mass was said, followed by a religious\r\nprocession through the streets. The Governor sent a commission to\r\nJapan, under the control of Luis de Navarrete, to ask for the dead\r\nbodies and chattels of the executed priests. The Emperor showed no\r\nrancour whatsoever; on the contrary, his policy was already carried\r\nout; and to welcome the Spanish lay deputies, he gave a magnificent\r\nbanquet and entertained them sumptuously. Luis de Navarrete having\r\nclaimed the dead bodies of the priests, the Emperor at once ordered\r\nthe guards on the execution ground to retire, and told Navarrete\r\nthat he could dispose as he pleased of the mortal remains. Navarrete\r\ntherefore hastened to Nagasaki, but before he could reach there,\r\ndevout Catholics had cut up the bodies, one carrying away a head,\r\nanother a leg, and so forth. It happened, too, that Navarrete died\r\nof disease a few days after his arrival in Nagasaki. His successor,\r\nDiego de Losa, recovered the pieces of the deceased priests, which\r\nhe put into a box and shipped for Manila, but the vessel and box of\r\nrelics were lost on the way.\r\n\r\nDiego de Losa returned to Manila, the bearer of a polite letter\r\nand very acceptable presents from the Emperor to the Governor of\r\nthe Philippines.\r\n\r\nThe letter fully expatiated on recent events, and set forth a\r\nwell-reasoned justification of the Emperor's decrees against the\r\npriests, in terms which proved that he was neither a tyrant nor a\r\nwanton savage, but an astute politician. The letter stated, that under\r\nthe pretext of being ambassadors, the priests in question had come\r\ninto the country and had taught a diabolical law belonging to foreign\r\ncountries, and which aimed at superseding the rites and laws of his\r\nown religion, confused his people, and destroyed his Government and\r\nkingdom; for which reason he had rigorously proscribed it. Against\r\nthese prohibitions, the religious men of Luzon preached their law\r\npublicly to humble people, such as servants and slaves. Not being\r\nable to permit this persistence in law-breaking, he had ordered their\r\ndeath by placing them on crosses; for he was informed that in the\r\nkingdom where Spaniards dominated, this teaching of their religious\r\ndoctrine was but an artifice and stratagem by means of which the civil\r\npower was deceitfully gained. He astutely asks the Gov.-General if\r\nhe would consent to Japanese preaching their laws in his territory,\r\nperturbing public peace with such novelties amongst the lower classes?\r\n\r\nCertainly it would be severely repressed, argued the Emperor, adding\r\nthat in the exercise of his absolute power and for the good of his\r\nsubjects, he had avoided the occurrence in his dominions of what had\r\ntaken place in those regions where the Spaniards deposed the legitimate\r\nkings, and constituted themselves masters by religious fraud.\r\n\r\nHe explains that the seizure of the cargo of a Spanish ship was only a\r\nreprisal for the harm which he had suffered by the tumult raised when\r\nthe edict was evaded. But as the Spanish Governor had thought fit to\r\nsend another ambassador from so far, risking the perils of the sea,\r\nhe was anxious for peace and mutual good-feeling, but only on the\r\nprecise condition that no more individuals should be sent to teach\r\na law foreign to his realm, and under these unalterable conditions\r\nthe Governor's subjects were at liberty to trade freely with Japan;\r\nthat by reason of his former friendship and royal clemency, he had\r\nrefrained from killing all the Spaniards with the priests and their\r\nservants, and had allowed them to return to their country.\r\n\r\nAs to religion itself, Taycosama is said to have remarked that\r\namong so many professed, one more was of little consequence,--hence\r\nhis toleration in the beginning, and his continued permission\r\nto the Jesuits to maintain their doctrines amongst their own\r\nsectarians. Moreover, it is said that a map was shown to Taycosama,\r\nmarking the domains of the King of Spain and Portugal, and that in\r\nreply to his inquiry: \"How could one man have conquered such vast\r\nterritory?\"--a certain Father Guzman (probably a Portuguese) answered:\r\n\"By secretly sending religious men to teach their doctrine, and when a\r\nsufficient number of persons were so converted, the Spanish soldiery,\r\nwith their aid, annexed their country and overthrew their kings.\" Such\r\nan avowal naturally impressed Taycosama profoundly. [33]\r\n\r\nIn Seville there was quite a tumult when the details of the executions\r\nin Japan were published.\r\n\r\nIn the meantime, the lamentable end of the Franciscan missionaries\r\ndid not deter others from making further attempts to follow their\r\nexample. During the first 20 years of the 17th century, priests\r\nsucceeded in entering Japan, under the pretence of trading, in spite\r\nof the extreme measures adopted to discover them and the precautions\r\ntaken to uproot the new doctrine, which it was feared would become\r\nthe forerunner of sedition. Indeed, many Japanese nobles professing\r\nChristianity had already taken up their residence in Manila, and were\r\nregarded by the Emperor as a constant danger to his realm, hence he\r\nwas careful to avoid communication with the Philippines. During the\r\nshort reigns of Dayfusama and his son Xogusama, new decrees were\r\nissued, not against foreign Christians, but against those who made\r\napostates amongst the Japanese; and consequently two more Spanish\r\npriests were beheaded.\r\n\r\nIn September, 1622, a large number of Spanish missionaries\r\nand Christian Japanese men and children were executed in\r\nNagasaki. Twenty-five of them were burnt and the rest beheaded,\r\ntheir remains being thrown into the sea to avoid the Christians\r\nfollowing their odious custom of preserving parts of corpses as\r\nrelics. Two days afterwards, four Franciscan and two Dominican\r\nfriars with five Japanese were burnt in Omura. Then followed an\r\nedict stating the pains and penalties, civil deprivations, etc.,\r\nagainst all who refused to abandon their apostasy and return to the\r\nfaith of their forefathers. Another edict was issued imposing death\r\nupon those who should conduct priests to Japan, and forfeiture of the\r\nships in which they should arrive and the merchandise with which they\r\nshould come. To all informers against native apostates the culprits'\r\nestates and goods were transferred as a reward.\r\n\r\nA Spanish deputation was sent to the Emperor of Japan in 1622,\r\nalleging a desire to renew commercial relations, but the Emperor was\r\nso exasperated at the recent defiance of his decrees that he refused\r\nto accept the deputies' presents from the Philippine Government,\r\nand sent them and the deputation away.\r\n\r\nStill there were friars in Manila eager to seek martyrdom, but the\r\nPhilippine traders, in view of the danger of confiscation of their\r\nships and merchandise if they carried missionaries, resolved not\r\nto despatch vessels to Japan if ecclesiastics insisted on taking\r\npassage. The Government supported this resolution in the interests of\r\ntrade, and formally prohibited the transport of priests. The Archbishop\r\nof Manila, on his part, imposed ecclesiastical penalties on those of\r\nhis subordinates who should clandestinely violate this prohibition.\r\n\r\nSupplicatory letters from Japan reached the religious communities in\r\nManila, entreating them to send more priests to aid in the spread of\r\nChristianity; therefore the chiefs of the Orders consulted together,\r\nbought a ship, and paid high wages to its officers to carry four\r\nFranciscan, four Dominican and two Recoleto priests to Japan. When\r\nthe Governor, Alonso Fajardo de Tua, heard of the intended expedition,\r\nhe threatened to prohibit it, affirming that he would not consent to\r\nany more victims being sent to Japan. Thereupon representatives of the\r\nreligious Orders waited upon him, to state that if he persisted in\r\nhis prohibition, upon his conscience would fall the enormous charge\r\nof having lost the souls which they had hoped to save. The Governor\r\ntherefore retired from the discussion, remitting the question to the\r\nArchbishop, who at once permitted the ship to leave, conveying the ten\r\npriests disguised as merchants. Several times the vessel was nearly\r\nwrecked, but at length arrived safely in a Japanese port. The ten\r\npriests landed, and were shortly afterwards burnt by Imperial order.\r\n\r\nIn Rome a very disputed inquiry had been made into the circumstances\r\nof the Franciscan mission; but, in spite of the severe ordeal of the\r\n_diaboli advocatus_, cononization was conceded to Pedro Bautista and\r\nhis companions.\r\n\r\nIn 1629 the Papal Bull of Urban VIII., dated September 14, 1627, was\r\npublished in Manila, amidst public feasts and popular rejoicing. The\r\nBull declared the missionaries of Japan to be Saints and Martyrs and\r\nPatron Saints of the second class. Increased animation in favour of\r\nmissions to Japan became general in consequence. Ten thousand pesos\r\nwere collected to fit out a ship to carry 12 priests from Manila,\r\nbesides 24 priests who came from Pangasinan to embark privately. The\r\nship, however, was wrecked off the Ilocos Province coast (Luzon Is.),\r\nbut the crew and priests were saved.\r\n\r\nA large junk was then secretly prepared at a distance from Manila\r\nfor the purpose of conveying another party of friars to Japan; but,\r\njust as they were about to embark, the Governor sent a detachment\r\nof soldiers with orders to prevent them doing so, and he definitely\r\nprohibited further missionary expeditions.\r\n\r\nIn 1633 the final extinction of Christians was vigorously commenced\r\nby the Emperor To-Kogunsama; and in the following year 79 persons\r\nwere executed. The same Emperor sent a ship to Manila with a present\r\nof 150 lepers, saying that, as he did not permit Christians in his\r\ncountry, and knowing that the priests had specially cared for these\r\nunfortunate beings, he remitted them to their care. The first impulse\r\nof the Spaniards was to sink the ship with cannon shots, but finally it\r\nwas agreed to receive the lepers, who were conducted with great pomp\r\nthrough the city and lodged in a large shed at Dilao (now the suburb\r\nof Paco). This gave rise to the foundation of the Saint Lazarus'\r\n(Lepers') Hospital, existing at the present day. [34] The Governor\r\nreplied to the Emperor that if any more were sent he would kill them\r\nand their conductors.\r\n\r\nThe Emperor then convoked a great assembly of his vassal kings and\r\nnobles, and solemnly imposed upon them the strict obligation to fulfil\r\nall the edicts against the entry and permanence of Christians, under\r\nsevere penalties, forfeiture of property, deprivation of dignities,\r\nor death. So intent was this Prince on effectually annihilating\r\nChristianity within his Empire, that he thenceforth interdicted all\r\ntrade with Macao; and when in 1640 his decree was disregarded by\r\nfour Portuguese traders, who, describing themselves as ambassadors,\r\narrived with a suite of 46 Orientals, they were all executed.\r\n\r\nIn the same year the Governor of the Philippines called a Congress of\r\nlocal officials and ecclesiastics, amongst whom it was agreed that to\r\nsend missionaries to Japan was to send them directly to death, and it\r\nwas thenceforth resolved to abandon Catholic missions in that country.\r\n\r\nSecret missions and consequent executions still continued until about\r\nthe year 1642, when the Dutch took Tanchiu--in Formosa Island--from\r\nthe Spaniards, and intercepted the passage to Japan of priests and\r\nmerchants alike. The conquest of Japan was a feat which all the\r\nartifice of King Philip IV.'s favourites and their monastic agents\r\ncould not compass.\r\n\r\nIn 1862, during the Pontificate of Pius IX., 620 missionaries who had\r\nmet with martyrdom in Japan, in the 17th century, were canonized with\r\ngreat pomp and appropriate ceremony in Rome.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VI\r\n\r\nConflicts with the Dutch\r\n\r\n\r\n_Consequent_ on the union of the Crowns of Portugal and Spain\r\n(1581-1640), the feuds, as between nations, diplomatically subsided,\r\nalthough the individual antagonism was as rife as ever.\r\n\r\nSpanish and Portuguese interests in the Moluccas, as elsewhere, were\r\nthenceforth officially mutual. In the Molucca group, the old contests\r\nbetween the once rival kingdoms had estranged the natives from their\r\nancient compulsory alliances. Anti-Portuguese and Philo-Portuguese\r\nparties had sprung up amongst the petty sovereignties, but the\r\nPortuguese fort and factory established in Ternate Island were held\r\nfor many years, despite all contentions. But another rivalry, as\r\nformidable and more detrimental than that of the Portuguese in days\r\ngone by, now menaced Spanish ascendancy.\r\n\r\nFrom the close of the 16th century up to the year of the \"Family\r\nCompact\" Wars (1763), Holland and Spain were relentless foes. To\r\nrecount the numerous combats between their respective fleets during\r\nthis period, would itself require a volume. It will suffice here to\r\nshow the bearing of these political conflicts upon the concerns of the\r\nPhilippine Colony. The Treaty of Antwerp, which was wrung from the\r\nSpaniards in 1609, 28 years after the union of Spain and Portugal,\r\nbroke the scourge of their tyranny, whilst it failed to assuage\r\nthe mutual antipathy. One of the consequences of the \"Wars of the\r\nFlanders,\" which terminated with this treaty, was that the Dutch were\r\nobliged to seek in the Far East the merchandise which had hitherto\r\nbeen supplied to them from the Peninsula. The short-sighted policy\r\nof the Spaniards in closing to the Dutch the Portuguese markets,\r\nwhich were now theirs, brought upon themselves the destruction of\r\nthe monopolies which they had gained by the Union. The Dutch were\r\nnow free, and their old tyrant's policy induced them to establish\r\nindependently their own trading headquarters in the Molucca Islands,\r\nwhence they could obtain directly the produce forbidden to them in\r\nthe home ports. Hence, from those islands, the ships of a powerful\r\nNetherlands Trading Company sallied forth from time to time to meet\r\nthe Spanish galleons from Mexico laden with silver and manufactured\r\ngoods. Previous to this, and during the Wars of the Flanders,\r\nDutch corsairs hovered about the waters of the Moluccas, to take\r\nreprisals from the Spaniards. These encounters frequently took place\r\nat the eastern entrance of the San Bernadino Straits, where the Dutch\r\nwere accustomed to heave-to in anticipation of the arrival of their\r\nprizes. In this manner, constantly roving about the Philippine waters,\r\nthey enriched themselves at the expense of their detested adversary,\r\nand, in a small degree, avenged themselves of the bloodshed and\r\noppression which for over sixty years had desolated the Low Countries.\r\n\r\nThe Philippine Colony lost immense sums in the seizure of its\r\ngalleons from Mexico, upon which it almost entirely depended for\r\nsubsistence. Being a dependency of New Spain, its whole intercourse\r\nwith the civilized world, its supplies of troops and European\r\nmanufactured articles, were contingent upon the safe arrival of the\r\ngalleons. Also the dollars with which they annually purchased cargoes\r\nfrom the Chinese for the galleons came from Mexico. Consequently,\r\nthe Dutch usually took the aggressive in these sea-battles, although\r\nthey were not always victorious. When there were no ships to meet,\r\nthey bombarded the ports where others were being built. The Spaniards,\r\non their part, from time to time fitted out vessels to run down to\r\nthe Molucca Islands to attack the enemy in his own waters.\r\n\r\nDuring the Governorship of Gomez Perez Dasmarinas (1590-93), the\r\nnative King of Siao Island--one of the Molucca group--came to Manila\r\nto offer homage and vassalage to the representative of the King of\r\nSpain and Portugal, in return for protection against the incursions\r\nof the Dutch and the raids of the Ternate natives. Dasmarinas received\r\nhim and the Spanish priests who accompanied him with affability, and,\r\nbeing satisfied with his credentials, he prepared a large expedition\r\nto go to the Moluccas to set matters in order. The fleet was composed\r\nof several frigates, 1 ship, 6 galleys, and 100 small vessels, all\r\nwell armed. The fighting men numbered 100 Spaniards, 400 Pampanga and\r\nTagalog arquebusiers, 1,000 Visaya archers and lancers, besides 100\r\nChinese to row the galleys. This expedition, which was calculated to\r\nbe amply sufficient to subdue all the Moluccas, sailed from Cavite\r\non October 6, 1593. The sailing ships having got far ahead of the\r\ngalleys, they hove-to off Punta de Azufre (N. of Maricaban Is.) to\r\nwait for them. The galleys arrived; and the next day they were able\r\nto start again in company. Meanwhile, a conspiracy was formed by the\r\nChinese galleymen to murder all the Spaniards. Assuming these Chinese\r\nto be volunteers, their action would appear to be extremely vile. If,\r\nhowever, as is most probable, they were pressed into this military\r\nservice to foreigners, it seems quite natural, that being forced to\r\nbloodshed without alternative, they should first fight for their own\r\nliberty, seeing that they had come to the Islands to trade.\r\n\r\nAll but the Chinese were asleep, and they fell upon the Spaniards in\r\na body. Eighteen of the troops and four slaves escaped by jumping\r\ninto the sea. The Governor was sleeping in his cabin, but awoke on\r\nhearing the noise. He supposed the ship had grounded, and was coming\r\nup the companion _en deshabille_, when a Chinaman clove his head with\r\na cutlass. The Governor reached his state-room, and taking his Missal\r\nand the Image of the Virgin in his hand, he died in six hours. The\r\nChinese did not venture below, where the priests and armed soldiers\r\nwere hidden. They cleared the decks of all their opponents, made fast\r\nthe hatches and gangways, and waited three days, when, after putting\r\nashore those who were still alive, they escaped to Cochin China, where\r\nthe King and Mandarins seized the vessel and all she carried. On board\r\nwere found 12,000 pesos in coin, some silver, and jewels belonging\r\nto the Governor and his suite. Thus the expedition was brought to an\r\nuntimely end. The King of Siao, and the missionaries accompanying him,\r\nhad started in advance for Otong (Panay Is.) to wait for the Governor,\r\nand there they received the news of the disaster.\r\n\r\nAmongst the most notable of the successful expeditions of the\r\nSpaniards, was that of Pedro Bravo de Acuna, in 1606, which consisted\r\nof 19 frigates, 9 galleys, and 8 small craft, carrying a total\r\nof about 2,000 men, and provisions for a prolonged struggle. The\r\nresult was that they subdued a petty sultan, friendly to the Dutch,\r\nand established a fortress on his island.\r\n\r\nAbout the year 1607 the Supreme Court (the Governorship being vacant\r\nfrom 1606 to 1608), hearing that a Dutch vessel was hovering off\r\nTernate, sent a ship against it, commanded by Pedro de Heredia. A\r\ncombat ensued. The Dutch commander was taken prisoner with several of\r\nhis men, and lodged in the fort at Ternate, but was ransomed on payment\r\nof P50,000 to the Spanish commander. Heredia returned joyfully to\r\nManila, where, much to his surprise, he was prosecuted by the Supreme\r\nCourt for exceeding his instructions, and expired of melancholy. The\r\nransomed Dutch leader was making his way back to his headquarters\r\nin a small ship, peacefully, and without threatening the Spaniards\r\nin any way, when the Supreme Court treacherously sent a galley and\r\na frigate after him to make him prisoner a second time. Overwhelmed\r\nby numbers and arms, and little expecting such perfidious conduct\r\nof the Spaniards, he was at once arrested and brought to Manila. The\r\nDutch returned 22 Spanish prisoners of war to Manila to ransom him,\r\nbut whilst these were retained, the Dutch commander was nevertheless\r\nimprisoned for life.\r\n\r\nSome years afterwards a Dutch squadron anchored off the south point\r\nof Bataan Province, not far from Punta Mariveles, at the entrance\r\nto Manila Bay. Juan de Silva, the Governor (1609-16), was in great\r\nstraits. Several ships had been lost by storms, others were away,\r\nand there was no adequate floating armament with which to meet the\r\nenemy. However, the Dutch lay-to for five or six months, waiting to\r\nseize the Chinese and Japanese traders' goods on their way to the\r\nManila market. They secured immense booty, and were in no hurry to\r\nopen hostilities. This delay gave de Silva time to prepare vessels to\r\nattack the foe. In the interval he dreamt that Saint Mark had offered\r\nto help him defeat the Dutch. On awaking, he called a priest, whom he\r\nconsulted about the dream, and they agreed that the nocturnal vision\r\nwas a sign from Heaven denoting a victory. The priest went (from\r\nCavite) to Manila to procure a relic of this glorious intercessor,\r\nand returned with his portrait to the Governor, who adored it. In\r\nhaste the ships and armament were prepared. On Saint Mark's day,\r\ntherefore, the Spaniards sallied forth from Cavite with six ships,\r\ncarrying 70 guns, and two galleys and two launches, also well armed,\r\nbesides a number of small, light vessels to assist in the formation\r\nof line of battle.\r\n\r\nAll the European fighting men in Manila and Cavite embarked--over\r\n1,000 Spaniards--the flower of the Colony, together with a large\r\nforce of natives, who were taught to believe that the Dutch were\r\ninfidels. On the issue of this day's events perchance depended\r\nthe possession of the Colony. Manila and Cavite were garrisoned by\r\nvolunteers. Orations were offered in the churches. The Miraculous\r\nImage of Our Lady of the Guide was taken in procession from the\r\nHermitage, and exposed to public view in the Cathedral. The Saints\r\nof the different churches and sanctuaries were adored and exhibited\r\ndaily. The Governor himself took the supreme command, and dispelled\r\nall wavering doubt in his subordinates by proclaiming Saint Mark's\r\npromise of intercession. On his ship he hoisted the Royal Standard,\r\non which was embroidered the Image of the Blessed Virgin, with the\r\nmotto \"_Mostrate esse Matrem_\" and over a beautifully calm sea he\r\nled the way to battle and to victory.\r\n\r\nA shot from the Spanish heavy artillery opened the bloody combat. The\r\nDutch were completely vanquished, after a fierce struggle, which\r\nlasted six hours. Their three ships were destroyed, and their flags,\r\nartillery, and plundered merchandise, to the value of P300,000, were\r\nseized. This famous engagement was thenceforth known as the Battle\r\nof Playa Honda.\r\n\r\nAgain, in 1611, under de Silva, a squadron sailed to the Moluccas\r\nand defeated the Dutch off Gilolo Island.\r\n\r\nIn 1617 the Spaniards had a successful engagement off the Zambales\r\ncoast with the Dutch, who lost three of their ships.\r\n\r\nIn July, 1620, three Mexican galleons were met by three Dutch vessels\r\noff Cape Espiritu Santo (Samar Is.), at the entrance of the San\r\nBernadino Straits, but managed to escape in the dark. Two ran ashore\r\nand broke up; the third reached Manila. After this, the Gov.-General,\r\nAlonso Fajardo de Tua, ordered the course of the State ships to be\r\nvaried on each voyage.\r\n\r\nIn 1625 the Dutch again appeared off the Zambales coast, and Geronimo\r\nde Silva went out against them. The Spaniards, having lost one man,\r\nrelinquished the pursuit of the enemy, and the Commander was brought\r\nto trial by the Supreme Court.\r\n\r\nIn 1626, at the close of the Governorship of Fernando de Silva, a\r\nSpanish Colony was founded on Formosa Island, but no supplies were sent\r\nto it, and consequently in 1642 it surrendered to the Dutch, who held\r\nit for 20 years, until they were driven out by the Chinese adventurer\r\nKoxinga. And thus for over a century and a half the strife continued,\r\nuntil the Dutch concentrated their attention on the development of\r\ntheir Eastern Colonies, which the power of Spain, growing more and\r\nmore effete, was incompetent to impede.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the middle of the 17th century the Tartars invaded China and\r\noverthrew the Min Dynasty--at that time represented by the Chinese\r\nEmperor Yunglic. He was succeeded on the throne by the Tartar\r\nEmperor Kungchi, to whose arbitrary power nearly all the Chinese\r\nEmpire had submitted. Amongst the few Mongol chiefs who held out\r\nagainst Ta-Tsing dominion was a certain Mandarin known by the name of\r\nKoxinga, who retired to the Island of Kinmuen, where he asserted his\r\nindependence and defied his nation's conqueror. Securely established\r\nin his stronghold, he invited the Chinese to take refuge in his\r\nisland and oppose the Tartar's rule. Therefore the Emperor ordered\r\nthat no man should inhabit China within four leagues of the coast,\r\nexcept in those provinces which were undoubtedly loyal to the new\r\nGovernment. The coast was consequently laid bare; vessels, houses,\r\nplantations, and everything useful to man, were destroyed in order to\r\ncut off effectually all communications with lands beyond the Tartar\r\nEmpire. The Chinese from the coast, who for generations had earned a\r\nliving by fishing, etc., crowded into the interior, and their misery\r\nwas indescribable.\r\n\r\nKoxinga, unable to communicate with the mainland of the Empire,\r\nturned his attention to the conquest of Formosa Island, at the time\r\nin the possession of the Dutch. According to Dutch accounts the\r\nEuropean settlers numbered about 600, with a garrison of 2,200. The\r\nDutch artillery, stores, and merchandise were valued at P8,000,000,\r\nand the Chinese, who attacked them under Koxinga, were about 100,000\r\nstrong. The settlement surrendered to the invaders' superior numbers,\r\nand Koxinga established himself as King of the Island. Koxinga had\r\nbecome acquainted with an Italian Dominican missionary named Vittorio\r\nRiccio, whom he created a Mandarin, and sent him as Ambassador to\r\nthe Governor of the Philippines. Riccio therefore arrived in Manila\r\nin 1662, the bearer of Koxinga's despatches calling upon the Governor\r\nto pay tribute, under threat of the Colony being attacked by Koxinga\r\nif his demand were refused.\r\n\r\nThe position of Riccio as a European friar and Ambassador of a\r\nMongol adventurer was as awkward as it was novel. He was received\r\nwith great honour in Manila, where he disembarked, and rode to the\r\nGovernment House in the full uniform of a Chinese envoy, through\r\nlines of troops drawn up to salute him as he passed. At the same time,\r\nletters from Formosa had also been received by the Chinese in Manila,\r\nand the Government at once accused them of conniving at rebellion. All\r\navailable forces were concentrated in the capital; and to increase\r\nthe garrison the Governor published a decree, dated May 6, 1662,\r\nordering the demolition of the forts of Zamboanga, Yligan (Mindanao\r\nIs.), Calamianes and Ternale [35] (Moluccas).\r\n\r\nThe only provincial fort preserved was that of Surigao (then called\r\nCaraga), consequently in the south the Mahometans became complete\r\nmasters on land and at sea for half a year.\r\n\r\nThe troops in Manila numbered 100 cavalry and 8,000\r\ninfantry. Fortifications were raised, and redoubts were constructed\r\nin which to secrete the Treasury funds. When all the armament was in\r\nreadiness, the Spaniards incited the Chinese to rebel, in order to\r\nafford a pretext for their massacre.\r\n\r\nTwo junk masters were seized, and the Chinese population was menaced;\r\ntherefore they prepared for their own defence, and then opened the\r\naffray, for which the Government was secretly longing, by killing\r\na Spaniard in the market-place. Suddenly artillery fire was opened\r\non the Parian, and many of the peaceful Chinese traders, in their\r\nterror, hanged themselves; many were drowned in the attempt to reach\r\nthe canoes in which to get away to sea; some few did safely arrive\r\nin Formosa Island and joined Koxinga's camp, whilst others took\r\nto the mountains. Some 8,000 to 9,000 Chinese remained quiet, but\r\nready for any event, when they were suddenly attacked by Spaniards\r\nand natives. The confusion was general, and the Chinese seemed to\r\nbe gaining ground; therefore the Governor sent the Ambassador Riccio\r\nand a certain Fray Joseph de Madrid to parley with them. The Chinese\r\naccepted the terms offered by Riccio, who returned to the Governor,\r\nleaving Fray Joseph with the rebels; but when Riccio went back with\r\na general pardon and a promise to restore the two junk masters,\r\nhe found that they had beheaded the priest. A general carnage of\r\nthe Mongols followed, and Juan de la Concepcion says [36] that the\r\noriginal intention of the Spaniards was to kill every Chinaman,\r\nbut that they desisted in view of the inconvenience which would have\r\nensued from the want of tradesmen and mechanics. Therefore they made\r\na virtue of a necessity, and graciously pardoned in the name of His\r\nCatholic Majesty all who laid down their arms.\r\n\r\nRiccio returned to Formosa Island, and found Koxinga preparing for\r\nwarfare against the Philippines, but before he could carry out his\r\nintentions he died of fever. The chiefs successor, of a less bellicose\r\nspirit, sent Riccio a second time to Manila, and a treaty was agreed\r\nto, re-establishing commercial relations with the Chinese. Shortly\r\nafter Koxinga's decease a rebellion was raised in Formosa; and\r\nthe Island, falling at length into the hands of a Tartar party,\r\nbecame annexed to China under the new dynasty. Then Riccio was\r\ncalled upon to relate the part he had taken in Koxinga's affairs,\r\nand he was heard in council. Some present were in favour of invading\r\nthe Philippines in great force because of the cruel and unwarranted\r\ngeneral massacre of the Chinese in cold blood; but Riccio took pains\r\nto show how powerful Spain was, and how justified was the action of\r\nthe Spaniards, as a measure of precaution, in view of the threatened\r\ninvasion of Koxinga. The Chinese party was appeased, but had the\r\nTartars cared to take up the cause of their conquered subjects,\r\nthe fate of the Philippines would have been doubtful.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe rule of the Governors-General of the Islands was, upon\r\nthe whole, benignant with respect to the natives who manifested\r\nsubmission. Apart from the unconcealed animosity of the monastic party,\r\nthe Gov.-General's liberty of action was always very much locally\r\nrestrained by the Supreme Court and by individual officials. The\r\nstanding rule was, that in the event of the death or deprivation of\r\noffice of the Gov.-General, the Civil Government was to be assumed\r\nby the Supreme Court, and the military administration by the senior\r\nmagistrate. Latterly, in the absence of a Gov.-General, from any cause\r\nwhatsoever, the sub-inspector of the forces became Acting-Gov.-General.\r\n\r\nUp to the beginning of the last century the authority of the King's\r\nabsolute will was always jealously imposed, and the Governors-General\r\nwere frequently rebuked for having exercised independent action,\r\ntaking the initiative in what they deemed the best policy. But Royal\r\nDecrees could not enforce honesty; the peculations and frauds on the\r\npart of the secular authorities, and increasing quarrels and jealousies\r\namongst the several religious bodies, seemed to annihilate all prospect\r\nof social and material progress of the Colony. As early as the reign\r\nof Philip III. (1598-1621) the procurators of Manila had, during three\r\nyears, been unsuccessfully soliciting from the mother country financial\r\nhelp for the Philippines to meet official discrepancies. The affairs\r\nof the Colony were eventually submitted to a special Royal Commission\r\nin Spain, the result being that the King was advised to abandon this\r\npossession, which was not only unproductive, but had become a costly\r\ncentre of disputes and bad feeling. However, Fray Hernando de Moraga,\r\na missionary from the Philippines, happened to be in the Peninsula\r\nat the time, and successfully implored the King to withhold his\r\nratification of the recommendation of the Commission. His Majesty\r\navowed that even though the maintenance of this Colony should exhaust\r\nhis Mexican Treasury, his conscience would not allow him to consent\r\nto the perdition of souls which had been saved, nor to relinquish\r\nthe hope of rescuing yet far more in these distant regions.\r\n\r\nDuring the first two centuries following the foundation of the Colony,\r\nit was the custom for a Royal Commission to be appointed to inquire\r\ninto the official acts of the outgoing Governor before he could leave\r\nthe Islands--_Hacerle la residencia_, as it was called.\r\n\r\nWhilst on the one hand this measure effectually served as a check\r\nupon a Governor who might be inclined to adopt unjustifiable means\r\nof coercion, or commit defalcations, it was also attended with many\r\nabuses; for against an energetic ruler an antagonistic party was\r\nalways raised, ready to join in the ultimate ruin of the Governor\r\nwho had aroused their susceptibilities by refusing to favour their\r\nnefarious schemes. Hence when a _prima facie_ case was made out\r\nagainst a Governor, his inexperienced successor was often persuaded\r\nto consent to his incarceration whilst the articles of impeachment\r\nwere being investigated.\r\n\r\nSebastian Hurtado de Corcuera (1635-44) had been Governor of Panama\r\nbefore he was appointed to the Philippines. During his term of office\r\nhere he had usually sided with the Jesuits on important questions\r\ntaken up by the friars, and on being succeeded by Diego Fajardo,\r\nhe was brought to trial, fined P 25,000, and put into prison. After\r\nfive years' confinement he was released by Royal Order and returned\r\nto Spain, where the King partially compensated him with the Government\r\nof the Canary Islands.\r\n\r\nJuan Vargas (1678-84) had been in office for nearly seven years,\r\nand the Royal Commissioner who inquired into his acts took four years\r\nto draw up his report. He filled 20 large volumes of a statement of\r\nthe charges made against the late Governor, some of which were grave,\r\nbut the majority of them were of a very frivolous character. This is\r\nthe longest inquiry of the kind on record.\r\n\r\nActing-Governor Jose Torralba (1715-17) was arrested on the\r\ntermination of his Governorship and confined in the Fortress of\r\nSantiago, charged with embezzlement to the amount of P 700,000. He\r\nhad also to deposit the sum of P 20,000 for the expenses of the\r\ninquiry commission. Several other officials were imprisoned with him\r\nas accomplices in his crimes. He is said to have sent his son with\r\npublic funds on trading expeditions around the coasts, and his wife\r\nand young children to Mexico with an enormous sum of money defrauded\r\nfrom the Government. Figures at that date show, that when he took the\r\nGovernment, there was a balance in the Treasury of P 238,849, and\r\nwhen he left it in two years and a half, the balance was P 33,226,\r\nleaving a deficit of P 205,623, whilst the expenses of the Colony\r\nwere not extraordinary during that period. Amongst other charges,\r\nhe was accused of having sold ten Provincial Government licences\r\n(_encomiendas_), many offices of notaries, scriveners, etc., and\r\nconceded 27 months' gambling licences to the Chinese in the Parian\r\nwithout accounting to the Treasury. He was finally sentenced to pay\r\na fine of P 100,000, the costs of the trial, the forfeiture of the\r\nP 20,000 already deposited, perpetual deprivation of public office,\r\nand banishment from the Philippine Islands and Madrid. When the\r\nRoyal Order reached Manila he was so ill that his banishment was\r\npostponed. He lived for a short time nominally under arrest, and was\r\npermitted to beg alms for his subsistence within the city until he\r\ndied in the Hospital of San Juan de Dios in 1736.\r\n\r\nThe defalcations of some of the Governors caused no inconsiderable\r\nanxiety to the Sovereign. Pedro de Arandia, in his dual capacity of\r\nGov.-General and Chief Justice (1754-59), was a corrupt administrator\r\nof his country's wealth. He is said to have amassed a fortune of P\r\n25,000 during his five years' term of office, and on his death he\r\nleft it all to pious works (_vide_ \"Obras pias\").\r\n\r\nGovernor Berenguer y Marquina (1788-93) was accused of bribery,\r\nbut the King absolved him.\r\n\r\nIn the last century a Governor of Yloilo is said to have absconded in\r\na sailing-ship with a large sum of the public funds. A local Governor\r\nwas then also _ex-officio_ administrator; and, although the system\r\nwas afterwards reformed, official extortion was rife throughout the\r\nwhole Spanish administration of the Colony, up to the last.\r\n\r\nA strange drama of the year 1622 well portrays the spirit of the\r\ntimes--the immunity of a Gov.-General in those days, as well as\r\nthe religious sentiment which accompanied his most questionable\r\nacts. Alonso Fajardo de Tua having suspected his wife of infidelity,\r\nwent to the house where she was accustomed to meet her paramour. Her\r\nattire was such as to confirm her husband's surmises. He called\r\na priest and instructed him to confess her, telling him that he\r\nintended to take her life. The priest, failing to dissuade Fajardo from\r\ninflicting such an extreme penalty, took her confession and proffered\r\nher spiritual consolation. Then Fajardo, incensed with jealousy,\r\nmortally stabbed her. No inquiry into the occurrence seems to have\r\nbeen made, and he continued to govern for two years after the event,\r\nwhen he died of melancholy. It is recorded that the paramour, who was\r\nthe son of a Cadiz merchant, had formerly been the accepted _fiance_\r\nof Fajardo's wife, and that he arrived in Manila in their company. The\r\nGovernor gave him time to confess before he killed him, after which\r\n(according to one account) he caused his house to be razed to the\r\nground, and the land on which it stood to be strewn with salt. Juan\r\nde la Concepcion, however, says that the house stood for one hundred\r\nyears after the event as a memorial of the punishment.\r\n\r\nIn 1640 Olivarez, King Philip IV.'s chief counsellor, had succeeded by\r\nhis arrogance and unprecedented policy of repression in arousing the\r\nlatent discontent of the Portuguese. A few years previously they had\r\nmade an unsuccessful effort to regain their independent nationality\r\nunder the sovereignty of the Duke of Braganza. At length, when a call\r\nwas made upon their boldest warriors to support the King of Spain in\r\nhis protracted struggle with the Catalonians, an insurrection broke\r\nout, which only terminated when Portugal had thrown off, for ever,\r\nthe scourge of Spanish supremacy.\r\n\r\nThe Duke of Braganza was crowned King of Portugal under the title\r\nof John IV., and every Portuguese colony declared in his favour,\r\nexcept Ceuta, on the African coast. The news of the separation\r\nof Portugal from Spain reached Manila in the following year. The\r\nGov.-General at that time--Sebastian Hurtado de Corcuera--at once\r\nsent out an expedition of picked men under Juan Claudio with orders\r\nto take Macao,--a Portuguese settlement at the mouth of the Canton\r\nRiver, about 40 miles west of Hongkong. The attempt miserably failed,\r\nand the blue-and-white ensign continued to wave unscathed over the\r\nlittle territory. The Governor of Macao, who was willing to yield,\r\nwas denounced a traitor to Portugal, and killed by the populace. Juan\r\nClaudio, who was taken prisoner, was generously liberated by favour\r\nof the Portuguese Viceroy of Goa, and returned to Manila to relate\r\nhis defeat. [37]\r\n\r\nThe Convent of Santa Clara was founded in Manila in 1621 by Geronima\r\nde la Asuncion, who, three years afterwards, was expelled from the\r\nmanagement by the friars because she refused to admit reforms in the\r\nconventual regulations. The General Council subsequently restored\r\nher to the matronship for 20 years. Public opinion was at this\r\ntime vividly aroused against the superiors of the convents, who,\r\nit was alleged, made serious inroads on society by inveigling the\r\nmarriageable young women into taking the veil and to live unnatural\r\nlives. The public demanded that there should be a fixed limit to\r\nthe number of nuns admitted. An ecclesiastic of high degree made\r\nstrenuous efforts to rescue three nuns who had just been admitted,\r\nbut the abbess persistently refused to surrender them until her\r\nexcommunication was published on the walls of the nunnery.\r\n\r\nIn 1750 a certain Mother Cecilia, who had been in the nunnery of Santa\r\nCatalina since she was 16 years of age, fell in love with a Spaniard\r\nwho lived opposite, named Francisco Antonio de Figueroa, and begged\r\nto be relieved of her vows and have her liberty restored to her. The\r\nArchbishop was willing to grant her request, which was, however,\r\nstoutly opposed by the Dominican friars. On appeal being made to the\r\nGovernor, as viceregal patron, he ordered her to be set at liberty. The\r\nfriars nevertheless defied the Governor, who, to sustain his authority,\r\nwas compelled to order the troops to be placed under arms, and the\r\ncommanding officer of the artillery to hold the cannons in readiness\r\nto fire when and where necessary. In view of these preparations, the\r\nfriars allowed the nun to leave her confinement, and she was lodged in\r\nthe College of Santa Potenciana pending the dispute. Public excitement\r\nwas intense. The Archbishop ordered the girl to be liberated, but as\r\nhis subordinates were still contumacious to his bidding, the Bishop\r\nof Cebu was invited to arbitrate on the question, but he declined\r\nto interfere, therefore an appeal was remitted to the Archbishop of\r\nMexico. In the meantime the girl was married to her lover, and long\r\nafterwards a citation arrived from Mexico for the woman to appear\r\nat that ecclesiastical court. She went there with her husband, from\r\nwhom she was separated whilst the case was being tried, but in the\r\nend her liberty and marriage were confirmed.\r\n\r\nDuring the Government of Nino de Tabora (1626-32), the High Host\r\nand sacred vessels were stolen from the Cathedral of Manila. The\r\nArchbishop was in consequence sorely distressed, and walked barefooted\r\nto the Jesuits' convent to weep with the priests, and therein find\r\na solace for his mental affliction. It was surmised that the wrath\r\nof God at such a crime would assuredly be avenged by calamities on\r\nthe inhabitants, and confessions were made daily. The friars agreed\r\nto appease the anger of the Almighty by making public penance and\r\nby public prayer. The Archbishop subjected himself to a most rigid\r\nabstinence. He perpetually fasted, ate herbs, drank only water,\r\nslept on the floor with a stone for a pillow, and flagellated his own\r\nbody. On Corpus Christi day a religious procession passed through the\r\npublic thoroughfares solemnly exhorting the delinquents to restore\r\nthe body of Our Saviour, but all in vain. The melancholy prelate,\r\nweak beyond recovery from his self-imposed privations, came to the\r\nwindow of his retreat as the _cortege_ passed in front of it, and\r\nthere he breathed his last.\r\n\r\nAs in all other Spanish colonies, the Inquisition had its secret\r\nagents or commissaries in the Philippines. Sometimes a priest would\r\nhold powers for several years to inquire into the private lives and\r\nacts of individuals, whilst no one knew who the informer was. The\r\nHoly Office ordered that its _Letter of Anathema_, with the names in\r\nfull of all persons who had incurred pains and penalties for heresy,\r\nshould be read in public places every three years, but this order\r\nwas not fulfilled. The _Letter of Anathema_ was so read in 1669,\r\nand the only time since then up to the present day was in 1718.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDuring the minority of the young Spanish King Charles II. the regency\r\nwas held by his mother, the Queen-Dowager, who was unfortunately\r\ninfluenced by favourites, to the great disgust of the Court and\r\nthe people. Amongst these sycophants was a man named Valenzuela, of\r\nnoble birth, who, as a boy, had followed the custom of those days,\r\nand entered as page to a nobleman--the Duke del Infantado--to learn\r\nmanners and Court etiquette.\r\n\r\nThe Duke went to Italy as Spanish ambassador, and took Valenzuela\r\nunder his protection. He was a handsome and talented young fellow,\r\nlearned for those times,--intelligent, well versed in all the generous\r\nexercises of chivalry, and a poet by nature. On his return from Italy\r\nwith the Duke, his patron caused him to be created a Cavalier of the\r\nOrder of Saint James. The Duke shortly afterwards died, but through\r\nthe influence of the Dowager-Queen's confessor--the notorious Nitard,\r\nalso a favourite--young Valenzuela was presented at Court, where he\r\nmade love to one of the Queen's maids-of-honour--a German--and married\r\nher. The Prince, Don Juan de Austria, who headed the party against\r\nthe Queen, expelled her favourite (Nitard) from Court, and Valenzuela\r\nbecame Her Majesty's sole confidential adviser. Nearly every night,\r\nat late hours, the Queen went to Valenzuela's apartment to confer\r\nwith him, whilst he daily brought her secret news gleaned from the\r\ncourtiers. The Queen created him Marquis of San Bartolome and of\r\nVilla Sierra, a first-class Grandee of Spain, and Prime Minister. He\r\nwas a most perfect courtier; and it is related of him that when a\r\nbull-fight took place, he used to go to the royal box richly adorned\r\nin fighting attire, and, with profound reverence, beg Her Majesty's\r\nleave to challenge the bull. The Queen, it is said, never refused him\r\nthe solicited permission, but tenderly begged of him not to expose\r\nhimself to such dangers. Sometimes he would appear in the ring as a\r\ncavalier, in a black costume embroidered with silver and with a large\r\nwhite-and-black plume, in imitation of the Queen's half mourning. It\r\nwas much remarked that on one occasion he wore a device of the sun with\r\nan eagle looking down upon it, and the words, \"_I alone have licence_.\"\r\n\r\nHe composed several comedies, and allowed them to be performed at his\r\nexpense for the free amusement of the people. He also much improved\r\nthe city of Madrid with fine buildings, bridges, and many public\r\nworks to sustain his popularity amongst the citizens.\r\n\r\nThe young King, now a youth, ordered a deer hunt to be prepared in\r\nthe Escorial grounds; and during the diversion His Majesty happened\r\nto shoot Valenzuela in the muscle of his arm, whether intentionally or\r\naccidentally is not known. However, the terrified Queen-mother fainted\r\nand fell into the arms of her ladies-in-waiting. This circumstance was\r\nmuch commented upon, and contributed in no small degree to the public\r\nodium and final downfall of Valenzuela in 1684. At length Don Juan de\r\nAustria returned to the Court, when the young King was of an age to\r\nappreciate public concerns, and he became more the Court favourite\r\nthan ever Valenzuela or Nitard had been during the Dowager-Queen's\r\nadministration. Valenzuela fell at once from the exclusive position\r\nhe had held in royal circles and retired to the Escorial, where, by\r\norder of Don Juan de Austria, a party of young noblemen, including Don\r\nJuan's son, the Duke of Medina Sidonia, the Marquis of Valparaiso,\r\nand others of rank, accompanied by 200 horsemen, went to seize the\r\ndisfavoured courtier. He was out walking at the time of their arrival,\r\nbut he was speedily apprised of the danger by his bosom friend, the\r\nPrior of Saint Jerome Monastery. The priest hid him in the roof of the\r\nmonastery, where, being nearly suffocated for want of ventilation,\r\na surgeon was sent up to bleed him and make him sleep. The search\r\nparty failed to find the refugee, and were about to return, when the\r\nsurgeon treacherously betrayed the secret to them, and Valenzuela\r\nwas discovered sleeping with arms by his side. He was made prisoner,\r\nconfined in a castle, degraded of all his honours and rank, and finally\r\nbanished by Don Juan de Austria to the furthermost Spanish possession\r\nin the world--the Philippines,--whilst his family was incarcerated\r\nin a convent at Talavera in Spain.\r\n\r\nWhen the Pope heard of this violation of Church asylum in the Escorial\r\ncommitted by the nobles, he excommunicated all concerned in it;\r\nand in order to purge themselves of their sin and obtain absolution,\r\nthey were compelled to go to church in their shirts, each with a rope\r\naround his neck. They actually performed this penance, and then the\r\nNuncio accredited to the Spanish Court, Cardinal Mellini, relieved\r\nthem of their ecclesiastical pains and penalties.\r\n\r\nValenzuela was permitted to establish a house within the prison of\r\nCavite, where he lived for several years as a State prisoner and\r\nexile. When Don Juan de Austria died, the Dowager-Queen regained\r\nin a measure her influence at Court, and one of the first favours\r\nshe begged of her son, the King, was the return of Valenzuela to\r\nMadrid. The King granted her request, and she at once despatched a\r\nship to bring him to Spain, but the Secretary of State interfered\r\nand stopped it. Nevertheless, Valenzuela, pardoned and liberated,\r\nset out for the Peninsula, and reached Mexico, where he died from\r\nthe kick of a horse.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIn 1703 a vessel arrived in Manila Bay from India, under an Armenian\r\ncaptain, bringing a young man 35 years of age, a native of Turin,\r\nwho styled himself Monseigneur Charles Thomas Maillard de Tournon,\r\nVisitor-General, Bishop of Savoy, Patriarch of Antioch, Apostolic\r\nNuncio and Legate _ad latere_ of the Pope. He was on his way to China\r\nto visit the missions, and called at Manila with eight priests and\r\nfour Italian families.\r\n\r\nFollowing the custom established with foreign ships, the custodian\r\nof the Fort of Cavite placed guards on board this vessel. This act\r\nseems to have aroused the indignation of the exalted stranger, who\r\nassumed a very haughty tone, and arrogantly insisted upon a verbal\r\nmessage being taken to the Governor (Domingo Sabalburco) to announce\r\nhis arrival. In Manila these circumstances were much debated, and\r\nat length the Governor instructed the custodian of Cavite Fort to\r\naccompany the stranger to the City of Manila. On his approach a salute\r\nwas fired from the city battlements, and he took up his residence in\r\nthe house of the Maestre de Campo. There the Governor went to visit him\r\nas the Pope's legate, and was received with great arrogance. However,\r\nthe Governor showed no resentment; he seemed to be quite dumfounded by\r\nthe Patriarch's dignified airs, and consulted with the Supreme Court\r\nabout the irregularity of a legate arriving without exhibiting the\r\n_regium exequatur_. The Court decided that the stranger must be called\r\nupon to present his Papal credentials and the royal confirmation of\r\nhis powers with respect to Spanish dominions, and with this object a\r\nmagistrate was commissioned to wait upon him. The Patriarch treated\r\nthe commissioner with undisguised contempt, expressing his indignation\r\nand surprise at his position being doubted; he absolutely refused to\r\nshow any credentials, and turned out the commissioner, raving at him\r\nand causing an uproarious scandal. At each stage of the negotiations\r\nwith him the Patriarch put forward the great authority of the Pope,\r\nand his unquestionable right to dispose of realms and peoples at his\r\nwill, and somehow this ruse seemed to subdue everybody; the Governor,\r\nthe Archbishop, and all the authorities, civil and ecclesiastical, were\r\noverawed. The Archbishop, in fact, made an unconditional surrender to\r\nthe Patriarch, who now declared that all State and religious authority\r\nmust be subordinate to his will. The Archbishop was ordered by him\r\nto set aside his Archiepiscopal Cross, whilst the Patriarch used his\r\nown particular cross in the religious ceremonies, and left it in the\r\nCathedral of Manila on his departure. He went so far as to cause\r\nhis master of the ceremonies to publicly divest the Archbishop of\r\na part of his official robes and insignia, to all which the prelate\r\nmeekly consented. All the chief authorities visited the Patriarch,\r\nwho, however, was too dignified to return their calls. Here was,\r\nin fact, an extraordinary case of a man unknown to everybody, and\r\nrefusing to prove his identity, having absolutely brought all the\r\nauthority of a colony under his sway! He was, as a matter of fact,\r\nthe legate of Clement XI.\r\n\r\nThe only person to whom he appears to have extended his friendship was\r\nthe Maestre de Campo, at the time under ecclesiastical arrest. The\r\nMaestre de Campo was visited by the Patriarch, who so ingeniously\r\nblinded him with his patronage, that this official squandered\r\nabout P20,000 in entertaining his strange visitor and making him\r\npresents. The Patriarch in return insisted upon the Governor and\r\nArchbishop pardoning the Maestre de Campo of all his alleged misdeeds,\r\nand when this was conceded he caused the pardon to be proclaimed in\r\na public Act. All the Manila officials were treated by the Patriarch\r\nwith open disdain, but he created the Armenian captain of the vessel\r\nwhich brought him to Manila a knight of the \"Golden Spur,\" in a public\r\nceremony in the Maestre de Campo's house in which the Gov.-General\r\nwas ignored.\r\n\r\nFrom Manila the Patriarch went to China, where his meddling with\r\nthe Catholic missions met with fierce opposition. He so dogmatically\r\nasserted his unproved authority, that he caused European missionaries\r\nto be cited in the Chinese Courts and sentenced for their disobedience;\r\nbut he was playing with fire, for at last the Emperor of China, wearied\r\nof his importunities, banished him from the country. Thence he went\r\nto Macao, where, much to the bewilderment of the Chinese population,\r\nhe maintained constant disputes with the Catholic missionaries until he\r\ndied there in 1710 in the Inquisition prison, where he was incarcerated\r\nat the instance of the Jesuits.\r\n\r\nWhen King Philip V. became aware of what had occurred in Manila,\r\nhe was highly incensed, and immediately ordered the Gov.-General\r\nto Mexico, declaring him disqualified for life to serve under the\r\nCrown. The senior magistrates of the Supreme Court were removed from\r\noffice. Each priest who had yielded to the legate's authority without\r\npreviously taking cognisance of the _regium exequatur_ was ordered\r\nto pay P1,000 fine. The Archbishop was degraded and transferred\r\nfrom the Archbishopric of Manila to the Bishopric of Guadalajara in\r\nMexico. In spite of this punishment, it came to the knowledge of the\r\nKing that the ex-Archbishop of Manila, as Bishop of Guadalajara, was\r\nstill conspiring with the Patriarch to subvert civil and religious\r\nauthority in his dominions, with which object he had sent him P1,000\r\nfrom Mexico, and had promised a fixed sum of P1,000 per annum, with\r\nwhatever further support he could afford to give him. Therefore the\r\nKing issued an edict to the effect that any legate who should arrive\r\nin his domains without royal confirmation of his Papal credentials\r\nshould thenceforth be treated simply with the charity and courtesy\r\ndue to any traveller; and in order that this edict should not be\r\nforgotten, or evaded, under pretext of its having become obsolete,\r\nit was further enacted that it should be read in full on certain days\r\nin every year before all the civil and ecclesiastical functionaries.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VII\r\n\r\nBritish Occupation of Manila\r\n\r\n\r\nIn 1761 King George III. had just succeeded to the throne of England,\r\nand the protracted contentions with France had been suspended for\r\na while. It was soon evident, however, that efforts were being made\r\nto extinguish the power and prestige of Great Britain, and with this\r\nobject a convention had been entered into between France and Spain\r\nknown as the \"Family Compact.\" It was so called because it was an\r\nalliance made by the three branches of the House of Bourbon, namely,\r\nLouis XV. of France, Charles III. of Spain, and his son Ferdinand, who,\r\nin accordance with the Treaty of Vienna, had ascended the throne of\r\nNaples. Spain engaged to unite her forces with those of France against\r\nEngland on May 1, 1762, if the war still lasted, in which case France\r\nwould restore Minorca to Spain. Pitt was convinced of the necessity of\r\nmeeting the coalition by force of arms, but he was unable to secure\r\nthe support of his Ministry to declare war, and he therefore retired\r\nfrom the premiership. The succeeding Cabinet were, nevertheless,\r\ncompelled to adopt his policy, and after having lost many advantages\r\nby delaying their decision, war was declared against France and Spain.\r\n\r\nThe British were successful everywhere. In the West Indies the\r\nCaribbean Islands and Havana were captured with great booty by Rodney\r\nand Monckton, whilst a British Fleet was despatched to the Philippine\r\nIslands with orders to take Manila.\r\n\r\nOn September 14, 1762, a British vessel arrived in the Bay of Manila,\r\nrefused to admit Spanish officers on board, and after taking soundings\r\nshe sailed again out of the harbour.\r\n\r\nIn the evening of September 22 the British squadron, composed of 13\r\nships, under the command of Admiral Cornish, entered the bay, and the\r\nnext day two British officers were deputed to demand the surrender\r\nof the Citadel, which was refused. Brigadier-General Draper thereupon\r\ndisembarked his troops, and again called upon the city to yield. This\r\ncitation being defied, the bombardment commenced the next day. The\r\nfleet anchored in front of a powder-magazine, took possession of the\r\nchurches of Malate, Ermita, San Juan de Bagumbayan, and Santiago. Two\r\npicket-guards made an unsuccessful sortie against them. The whole force\r\nin Manila, at the time, was the King's regiment, which mustered about\r\n600 men and 80 pieces of artillery. The British forces consisted of\r\n1,500 European troops (one regiment of infantry and two companies\r\nof artillery), 3,000 seamen, 800 Sepoy fusileers, and 1,400 Sepoy\r\nprisoners, making a total of 6,830 men, including officers. [38]\r\n\r\nThere was no Gov.-General in the Philippines at the time, and the\r\nonly person with whom the British Commander could treat was the\r\nacting-Governor, the Archbishop Manuel Antonio Rojo, who was willing to\r\nyield. His authority was, however, set aside by a rebellious war party,\r\nwho placed themselves under the leadership of a magistrate of the\r\nSupreme Court, named Simon de Anda y Salazar. This individual, instead\r\nof leading them to battle, fled to the Province of Bulacan the day\r\nbefore the capture of Manila in a prahu with a few natives, carrying\r\nwith him some money and half a ream of official stamped paper. [39]\r\nHe knew perfectly well that he was defying the legal authority of\r\nthe acting-Governor, and was, in fact, in open rebellion against his\r\nmandate. It was necessary, therefore, to give an official colour to\r\nhis acts by issuing his orders and proclamations on Government-stamped\r\npaper, so that their validity might be recognized if he subsequently\r\nsucceeded in justifying his action at Court.\r\n\r\nOn September 24 the Spanish batteries of San Diego and San Andres\r\nopened fire, but with little effect. A richly laden galleon--the\r\n_Philipino_--was known to be on her way from Mexico to Manila, but the\r\nBritish ships which were sent in quest of her fell in with another\r\ngalleon--the _Trinidad_--and brought their prize to Manila. Her\r\ntreasure amounted to about P2,500,000. [40]\r\n\r\nA Frenchman resident in Manila, Monsieur Faller, made an attack on\r\nthe British, who forced him to retire, and he was then accused by the\r\nSpaniards of treason. Artillery fire was kept up on both sides. The\r\nArchbishop's nephew was taken prisoner, and an officer was sent with\r\nhim to hand him over to his uncle. However, a party of natives fell\r\nupon them and murdered them. The officer's head having been cut off,\r\nit was demanded by General Draper. Excuses were made for not giving\r\nit up, and the General determined thenceforth to continue the warfare\r\nwith vigour and punish this atrocity. The artillery was increased by\r\nanother battery of three mortars, placed behind the church of Santiago,\r\nand the bombardment continued.\r\n\r\nFive thousand native recruits arrived from the provinces, and out of\r\nthis number 2,000 Pampangos were selected. They were divided into\r\nthree columns, in order to advance by different routes and attack\r\nrespectively the churches of Santiago, Malate, and Ermita, and the\r\ntroops on the beach. At each place they were driven back. The leader of\r\nthe attack on Malate and Ermita--Don Santiago Orendain--was declared\r\na traitor. The two first columns were dispersed with great confusion\r\nand loss. The third column retreated before they had sustained or\r\ninflicted any loss. The natives fled to their villages in dismay,\r\nand on October 5 the British entered the walled city. After a couple\r\nof hours' bombardment, the forts of San Andres and San Eugenio were\r\ndemolished, the artillery overturned, and the defenders' fusileers\r\nand sappers were killed.\r\n\r\nA council of war was now held by the Spaniards. General Draper\r\nsustained the authority of the Archbishop against the war party,\r\ncomposed chiefly of civilians determined to continue the defence\r\nin spite of the opinion of the military men, who argued that a\r\ncapitulation was inevitable. But matters were brought to a crisis\r\nby the natives, who refused to repair the fortifications, and the\r\nEuropeans were unable to perform such hard labour. Great confusion\r\nreigned in the city--the clergy fled through the Puerta del Parian,\r\nwhere there was still a native guard. According to Zuniga, the British\r\nspent 20,000 cannon balls and 5,000 shells in the bombardment of\r\nthe city.\r\n\r\nMajor Fell entered Manila (Oct. 6) at the head of his troops, and\r\nGeneral Draper followed, leading his column unopposed, with two\r\nfield-pieces in the van, whilst a constant musketry fire cleared the\r\nCalle Real (the central thoroughfare) as they advanced. The people\r\nfled before the enemy. The gates being closed, they scrambled up the\r\nwalls and got into boats or swam off.\r\n\r\nColonel Monson was sent by Draper to the Archbishop-Governor to\r\nsay that he expected immediate surrender. This requisition was\r\ndisputed by the Archbishop, who presented a paper purporting to be\r\nterms of capitulation. The Colonel refused to take it, and demanded\r\nan unconditional surrender. Then the Archbishop, a Colonel of the\r\nSpanish troops, and Colonel Monson went to interview the General,\r\nwhose quarters were in the Palace. The Archbishop, offering himself\r\nas a prisoner, presented the terms of capitulation, which provided\r\nfor the free exercise of their religion; security of private\r\nproperty; free trade to all the inhabitants of the Islands, and the\r\ncontinuation of the powers of the Supreme Court to keep order amongst\r\nthe ill-disposed. These terms were granted, but General Draper, on his\r\npart, stipulated for an indemnity of four millions of pesos, and it\r\nwas agreed to pay one half of this sum in specie and valuables and the\r\nother half in Treasury bills on Madrid. The capitulation, with these\r\nmodifications, was signed by Draper and the Archbishop-Governor. The\r\nSpanish Colonel took the document to the Fort to have it countersigned\r\nby the magistrates, which was at once done; the Fort was delivered\r\nup to the British, and the magistrates repaired to the Palace to pay\r\ntheir respects to the conquerors.\r\n\r\nWhen the British flag was seen floating over the Fort of Santiago\r\nthere was great cheering from the British Fleet. The Archbishop\r\nstated that when Draper reviewed the troops, more than 1,000 men\r\nwere missing, including sixteen officers. Among these officers were\r\na Major fatally wounded by an arrow on the first day of the assault,\r\nand the Vice-Admiral, who was drowned whilst coming ashore in a boat.\r\n\r\nThe natives who had been brought from the provinces to Manila were\r\nplundering and committing excesses in the city, so Draper had them\r\nall driven out. Guards were placed at the doors of the nunneries and\r\nconvents to prevent outrages on the women, and then the city was given\r\nup to the victorious troops for pillage during three hours. Zuniga,\r\nhowever, remarks that the European troops were moderate, but that the\r\nIndian contingents were insatiable. They are said to have committed\r\nmany atrocities, and, revelling in bloodshed, even murdered the\r\ninhabitants. They ransacked the suburbs of Santa Cruz and Binondo, and,\r\nacting like savage victorious tribes, they ravished women, and even\r\nwent into the highways to murder and rob those who fled. The three\r\nhours having expired, the troops were called in, but the following\r\nday a similar scene was permitted. The Archbishop thereupon besought\r\nthe General to put a stop to it, and have compassion on the city. The\r\nGeneral complied with this request, and immediately restored order\r\nunder pain of death for disobedience. Some Chinese were in consequence\r\nhanged. General Draper himself killed one whom he found in the act of\r\nstealing, and he ordered that all Church property should be restored,\r\nbut only some priests' vestments were recovered.\r\n\r\nDraper demanded the surrender of Cavite, which was agreed to by the\r\nArchbishop and magistrates, but the Commanding Officer refused to\r\ncomply. The Major of that garrison was sent with a message to the\r\nCommander, but on the way he talked with such freedom about the\r\nsurrender to the British, that the natives quitted their posts and\r\nplundered the Arsenal. The Commander, rather than face humiliation,\r\nretired to a ship, and left all further responsibility to the Major.\r\n\r\nMeasures were now taken to pay the agreed indemnity. However,\r\nthe consequent heavy contributions levied upon the inhabitants,\r\ntogether with the silver from the pious establishments, church\r\nornaments, plate, the Archbishop's rings and breast-cross, only\r\namounted to P546,000. The British then proposed to accept one\r\nmillion at once and draw the rest from the cargo of the galleon\r\n_Philipino_, should it result that she had not been seized by the\r\nBritish previous to the day the capitulation was signed--but the one\r\nmillion was not forthcoming. The day before the capture of Manila a\r\nroyal messenger had been sent off with P111,000, with orders to hide\r\nthem in some place in the Laguna de Bay. The Archbishop now ordered\r\ntheir return to Manila, and issued a requisition to that effect,\r\nbut the Franciscan friars were insubordinate, and armed the natives,\r\nwhom they virtually ruled, and the treasure was secreted in Majayjay\r\nConvent (Tayabas Province). Thence, on receipt of the Archbishop's\r\nmessage, it was carried across country to a place in North Pampanga,\r\nbordering on Cagayan and Pangasinan. The British, convinced that\r\nthey were being duped, insisted on their claim. Thomas Backhouse,\r\ncommanding the troops stationed at Pasig, went up to the Laguna de\r\nBay with 80 mixed troops, to intercept the bringing of the _Philipino_\r\ntreasure. He attacked Tunasan, Vinan and Santa Rosa, and embarked for\r\nPagsanjan, which was then the capital of the Laguna Province. The\r\ninhabitants, after firing the convent and church, fled. Backhouse\r\nreturned to Calamba, entered the Province of Batangas, overran it,\r\nand made several Austin friars prisoners. In Lipa he seized P3,000,\r\nand established his quarters there, expecting that the _Philipino_\r\ntreasure would be carried that way; but on learning that it had been\r\ntransported by sea to a Pampanga coast town, Backhouse returned to\r\nhis post at Pasig.\r\n\r\nIn the capitulation, the whole of the Archipelago was surrendered to\r\nthe British, but the magistrate Simon de Anda determined to appeal to\r\narms. Draper used stratagem, and issued a proclamation commiserating\r\nthe fate of the natives who paid tribute to Spaniards, and assuring\r\nthem that the King of England would not exact it. The Archbishop, as\r\nGovernor, became Draper's tool, sent messages to the Spanish families,\r\npersuading them to return, and appointed an Englishman, married in the\r\ncountry, to be Alderman of Tondo. Despite the strenuous opposition\r\nof the Supreme Court, the Archbishop, at the instance of Draper,\r\nconvened a council of native headmen and representative families,\r\nand proposed to them the cession of all the Islands to the King of\r\nEngland. Draper clearly saw that the ruling powers in the Colony,\r\njudging from their energy and effective measures, were the friars,\r\nso he treated them with great respect. The Frenchman Faller, who\r\nunsuccessfully opposed the British assault, was offered troops to\r\ngo and take possession of Zamboanga and assume the government there,\r\nbut he refused, as did also a Spaniard named Sandoval.\r\n\r\nDraper returned to Europe; Major Fell was left in command of the\r\ntroops, whilst Drake assumed the military government of the city, with\r\nSmith and Brock as council, and Brereton in charge of Cavite. Draper,\r\non leaving, gave orders for two frigates to go in search of the\r\n_Philipino_ treasure. The ships got as far as Capul Island and put into\r\nharbour. They were detained there by a ruse on the part of a half-caste\r\npilot, and in the meantime the treasure was stealthily carried away.\r\n\r\nSimon de Anda, from his provincial retreat, proclaimed himself\r\nGov.-General. He declared that the Archbishop and the magistrates,\r\nas prisoners of war, were dead in the eye of the law; and that\r\nhis assumption of authority was based upon old laws. None of his\r\ncountrymen disputed his authority, and he established himself in\r\nBacolor. The British Council then convened a meeting of the chief\r\ninhabitants, at which Anda was declared a seditious person and\r\ndeserving of capital punishment, together with the Marquis of Monte\r\nCastro, who had violated his _parole d'honneur_, and the Provincial\r\nof the Austin Friars, who had joined the rebel party. All the Austin\r\nfriars were declared traitors for having broken their allegiance to\r\nthe Archbishop's authority. The British still pressed for the payment\r\nof the one million, whilst the Spaniards declared they possessed no\r\nmore. The Austin friars were ordered to keep the natives peaceable\r\nif they did not wish to provoke hostilities against themselves. At\r\nlength, the British, convinced of the futility of decrees, determined\r\nto sally out with their forces, and 500 men under Thomas Backhouse\r\nwent up the Pasig River to secure a free passage for supplies to the\r\ncamp. Whilst opposite to Maybonga, a Spaniard, named Bustos, and his\r\nCagayan troops fired on them. The British returned the fire, and Bustos\r\nfled to Mariquina. The British passed the river, and sent an officer\r\nwith a white flag of truce to demand surrender. Bustos was insolent,\r\nand threatened to hang the officer if he returned. Backhouse's troops\r\nthen opened fire and placed two field-pieces, which completely scared\r\nthe natives, who fled in such great confusion that many were drowned\r\nin the river. Thence the British drove their enemy before them like a\r\nflock of goats, and reached the Bamban River, where the Sultan of Sulu\r\n[41] resided with his family. The Sultan, after a feigned resistance,\r\nsurrendered to the British, who fortified his dwelling, and occupied it\r\nduring the whole of the operations. There were subsequent skirmishes\r\non the Pasig River banks with the armed insurgents, who were driven\r\nas far as the Antipolo Mountains.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, Anda collected troops; and Bustos, as his\r\nLieutenant-General, vaunted the power of his chief through the Bulacan\r\nand Pampanga Provinces. A Franciscan and an Austin friar, having led\r\ntroops to Masilo, about seven miles from Manila, the British went out\r\nto dislodge them, but on their approach most of the natives feigned\r\nthey were dead, and the British returned without any loss in arms\r\nor men.\r\n\r\nThe British, believing that the Austin friars were conspiring against\r\nthem in connivance with those inside the city, placed these friars\r\nin confinement, and subsequently shipped away eleven of them to\r\nEurope. For the same reason they at last determined to enter the\r\nSaint Augustine Convent, and on ransacking it, they found that the\r\npriests had been lying to them all the time. Six thousand pesos\r\nin coin were found hidden in the garden, and large quantities of\r\nwrought silver elsewhere. The whole premises were then searched,\r\nand all the valuables were seized. A British expedition went\r\nout to Bulacan, sailing across the Bay and up the Hagonoy River,\r\nwhere they disembarked at Malolos on January 19, 1763. The troops,\r\nunder Captain Eslay, of the Grenadiers, numbered 600 men, many of\r\nwhom were Chinese volunteers. As they advanced from Malolos, the\r\nnatives and Spaniards fled. On the way to Bulacan, Bustos came out\r\nto meet them, but retreated into ambush on seeing they were superior\r\nin numbers. Bulacan Convent was defended by three small cannons. As\r\nsoon as the troops came in sight of the convent, a desultory fire\r\nof case-shot made great havoc in the ranks of the resident Chinese\r\nvolunteers forming the British vanguard. At length the British brought\r\ntheir field-pieces into action, and pointing at the enemy's cannon, the\r\nfirst discharge carried off the head of their artilleryman Ybarra. The\r\npanic-stricken natives decamped; the convent was taken by assault;\r\nthere was an indiscriminate fight and general slaughter. The _Alcalde_\r\nand a Franciscan friar fell in action; one Austin friar escaped,\r\nand another was seized and killed to avenge the death of the British\r\nsoldiers. The invading forces occupied the convent, and some of the\r\ntroops were shortly sent back to Manila. Bustos reappeared near the\r\nBulacan Convent with 8,000 native troops, of whom 600 were cavalry,\r\nbut they dared not attack the British. Bustos then manoeuvred in the\r\nneighbourhood and made occasional alarms. Small parties were sent\r\nout against him, with so little effect that the British Commander\r\nheaded a body in person, and put the whole of Bustos' troops to\r\nflight like mosquitoes before a gust of wind, for Bustos feared they\r\nwould be pursued into Pampanga. After clearing away the underwood,\r\nwhich served as a covert for the natives, the British reoccupied the\r\nconvent; but Bustos returned to his position, and was a second time\r\nas disgracefully routed by the British, who then withdrew to Manila.\r\n\r\nAt this time it was alleged that a conspiracy was being organized\r\namongst the Chinese resident in the Province of Pampanga with the\r\nobject of assassinating Anda and his Spanish followers. The Chinese\r\ncut trenches and raised fortifications, avowing that their bellicose\r\npreparations were only to defend themselves against the possible attack\r\nof the British; whilst the Spaniards saw in all this a connivance\r\nwith the invaders. The latter no doubt conjectured rightly. Anda,\r\nacting upon the views of his party, precipitated matters by appearing\r\nwith 14 Spanish soldiers and a crowd of native bowmen to commence the\r\nslaughter in the town of Guagua. The Chinese assembled there in great\r\nnumbers, and Anda endeavoured in vain to induce them to surrender to\r\nhim. He then sent a Spaniard, named Miguel Garces, with a message,\r\noffering them pardon in the name of the King of Spain if they would\r\nlay down their arms; but they killed the emissary, and Anda therefore\r\ncommenced the attack. The result was favourable for Anda's party,\r\nand great numbers of the Chinese were slain. Many fled to the fields,\r\nwhere they were pursued by the troops, whilst those who were captured\r\nwere hanged. Such was the inveterate hatred which Anda entertained\r\nfor the Chinese, that he issued a general decree declaring all the\r\nChinese traitors to the Spanish flag, and ordered them to be hanged\r\nwherever they might be found in the provinces. Thus thousands of\r\nChinese were executed who had taken no part whatever in the events\r\nof this little war.\r\n\r\nAdmiral Cornish having decided to return to Europe, again urged for the\r\npayment of the two millions of pesos instalment of the indemnity. The\r\nArchbishop was in great straits; he was willing to do anything,\r\nbut his colleagues opposed him, and Cornish was at length obliged to\r\ncontent himself with a bill on the Madrid Treasury. Anda appointed\r\nBustos _Alcalde_ of Bulacan, and ordered him to recruit and train\r\ntroops, as he still nurtured the hope of confining the British to\r\nManila--perhaps even of driving them out of the Colony.\r\n\r\nThe British in the city were compelled to adopt the most rigorous\r\nprecautions against the rising of the population within the walls,\r\nand several Spanish residents were arrested for intriguing against\r\nthem in concert with those outside.\r\n\r\nSeveral French prisoners from Pondicherry deserted from the British;\r\nand some Spanish regular troops, who had been taken prisoners, effected\r\ntheir escape. The Fiscal of the Supreme Court and a Senor Villa Corta\r\nwere found conspiring. The latter was caught in the act of sending\r\na letter to Anda, and was sentenced to be hanged and quartered--the\r\nquarters to be exhibited in public places. The Archbishop, however,\r\nobtained pardon for Villa Corta on the condition that Anda should\r\nevacuate the Pampanga Province: Villa Corta wrote to Anda, begging him\r\nto accede to this, but Anda absolutely refused to make any sacrifice\r\nto save his friend's life, and at the same time he wrote a disgraceful\r\nletter to the Archbishop, couched in such insulting terms that the\r\nBritish Commander burnt it without letting the Archbishop see it. Villa\r\nCorta's life was saved by the payment of P3,000.\r\n\r\nThe treasure brought by the _Philipino_ served Anda to organize\r\na respectable force of recruits. Spaniards who were living in the\r\nprovinces in misery, and a crowd of natives always ready for pay,\r\nenlisted. These forces, under Lieut.-General Bustos, encamped at\r\nMalinta, about five miles from Manila. The officers lodged in a house\r\nbelonging to the Austin friars, around which the troops pitched their\r\ntents--the whole being defended by redoubts and palisades raised\r\nunder the direction of a French deserter, who led a company. From\r\nthis place Bustos constantly caused alarm to the British troops, who\r\nonce had to retreat before a picket-guard sent to carry off the church\r\nbells of Quiapo. The British, in fact, were much molested by Bustos'\r\nMalinta troops, who forced the invaders to withdraw to Manila and\r\nreduce the extension of their outposts. This measure was followed\r\nup by a proclamation, dated January 23, 1763, in which the British\r\nCommander alluded to Bustos' troops as \"canaille and robbers,\" and\r\noffered a reward of P5,000 for Anda's head, declaring him and his\r\nparty rebels and traitors to their Majesties the Kings of Spain and\r\nEngland. Anda, chafing at his impotence to combat the invading party\r\nby force of arms, gave vent to his feelings of rage and disappointment\r\nby issuing a decree, dated from Bacolor (Pampanga), May 19, 1763,\r\nof which the translated text reads as follows, viz.:--\r\n\r\n\r\n    \"Royal Government Tribunal of these Islands for His Catholic\r\n    Majesty:--Whereas the Royal Government Tribunal, Supreme Government\r\n    and Captain-Generalship of His Catholic Majesty in these Islands\r\n    are gravely offended at the audacity and blindness of those men,\r\n    who, forgetting all humanity, have condemned as rebellious and\r\n    disobedient to both their Majesties, him, who as a faithful\r\n    vassal of His Catholic Majesty, and in conformity with the law,\r\n    holds the Royal Tribunal, Government and Captain-Generalship; and\r\n    having suffered by a reward being offered by order of the British\r\n    Governor in council to whomsoever shall deliver me alive or dead;\r\n    and by their having placed the arms captured in Bulacan at the\r\n    foot of the gallows--seeing that instead of their punishing and\r\n    censuring such execrable proceedings, the spirit of haughtiness\r\n    and pride is increasing, as shown in the proclamation published\r\n    in Manila on the 17th instant, in which the troops of His Majesty\r\n    are infamously calumniated--treating them as blackguards and\r\n    disaffected to their service--charging them with plotting to\r\n    assassinate the English officers and soldiers, and with having\r\n    fled when attacked--the whole of these accusations being false:\r\n    Now therefore by these presents, be it known to all Spaniards and\r\n    true Englishmen, that Messrs. Drake, Smith and Brock who signed the\r\n    proclamation referred to, must not be considered as vassals of His\r\n    Britannic Majesty, but as tyrants and common enemies unworthy of\r\n    human society, and therefore, I order that they be apprehended as\r\n    such, and I offer ten thousand pesos for each one of them alive or\r\n    dead. At the same time, I withdraw the order to treat the vassals\r\n    of His Britannic Majesty with all the humanity which the rights\r\n    of war will permit, as has been practised hitherto with respect\r\n    to the prisoners and deserters.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nAnda had by this time received the consent of his King to occupy the\r\nposition which he had usurped, and the British Commander was thus\r\nenabled to communicate officially with him, if occasion required it:\r\nDrake therefore replied to this proclamation, recommending Anda to\r\ncarry on the war with greater moderation and humanity.\r\n\r\nOn June 27, 1763, the British made a sortie from the city to dislodge\r\nBustos, who still occupied Malinta. The attacking party consisted of\r\n350 fusileers, 50 horsemen, a mob of Chinese, and a number of guns and\r\nammunition. The British took up quarters on one side of the river,\r\nwhilst Bustos remained on the other. The opposing parties exchanged\r\nfire, but neither cared nor dared to cross the water-way. The British\r\nforces retired in good order to Masilo, and remained there until they\r\nheard that Bustos had burnt Malinta House, belonging to the Austin\r\nfriars, and removed his camp to Meycauayan. Then the British withdrew\r\nto Manila in the evening. On the Spanish side there were two killed,\r\nfive mortally wounded, and two slightly wounded. The British losses\r\nwere six mortally wounded and seven disabled. This was the last\r\nencounter in open warfare. Chinamen occasionally lost their lives\r\nthrough their love of plunder in the vicinity occupied by the British.\r\n\r\nDuring these operations the priesthood taught the ignorant natives\r\nto believe that the invaders were infidels--and a holy war was\r\npreached. The friars, especially those of the Augustine Order,\r\n[42] abandoned their mission of peace for that of the sword, and\r\nthe British met with a slight reverse at Masilo, where a religious\r\nfanatic of the Austin friars had put himself at the head of a small\r\nband lying in ambush.\r\n\r\nOn July 23, 1763, a British frigate brought news from Europe of an\r\narmistice, and the preliminaries of peace, by virtue of which Manila\r\nwas to be evacuated (Peace of Paris, February 10, 1763), were received\r\nby the British Commander on August 27 following, and communicated\r\nby him to the Archbishop-Governor for the \"Commander-in-Chief\" of\r\nthe Spanish arms. Anda stood on his dignity, and protested that he\r\nshould be addressed directly, and be styled Captain-General. On this\r\nplea he declined to receive the communication. Drake replied by a\r\nmanifesto, dated September 19, to the effect that the responsibility\r\nof the blood which might be spilt in consequence of Anda's refusal\r\nto accept his notification would rest with him. Anda published\r\na counter-manifesto, dated September 28, in Bacolor (Pampanga),\r\nprotesting that he had not been treated with proper courtesy, and\r\nclaiming the governor-generalship.\r\n\r\nGreater latitude was allowed to the prisoners, and Villa Corta effected\r\nhis escape disguised as a woman. He fled to Anda,--the co-conspirator\r\nwho had refused to save his life,--and their superficial friendship\r\nwas renewed. Villa Corta was left in charge of business in Bacolor\r\nduring Anda's temporary absence. Meanwhile the Archbishop became ill;\r\nand it was discussed who should be his successor in the government\r\nin the event of his death. Villa Corta argued that it fell to him\r\nas senior magistrate. The discussion came to the knowledge of Anda,\r\nand seriously aroused his jealousy. Fearing conspiracy against\r\nhis ambitious projects, he left his camp at Polo, and hastened to\r\ninterrogate Villa Corta, who explained that he had only made casual\r\nremarks in the course of conversation. Anda, however, was restless on\r\nthe subject of the succession, and sought the opinion of all the chief\r\npriests and the bishops. Various opinions existed. Some urged that the\r\ndecision be left to the Supreme Court; others were in favour of Anda,\r\nwhilst many prudently abstained from expressing their views. Anda was\r\nso nervously anxious about the matter that he even begged the opinion\r\nof the British Commander, and wrote him on the subject from Bacolor\r\n(Pampanga) on November 2, 1763.\r\n\r\nMajor Fell seriously quarrelled with Drake about the Frenchman\r\nFaller, whom Admiral Cornish had left under sentence of death for\r\nhaving written a letter to Java accusing him of being a pirate and a\r\nrobber. Drake protected Faller, whilst Fell demanded his execution,\r\nand the dispute became so heated that Fell was about to slay Drake\r\nwith a bayonet, but was prevented by some soldiers. Fell then went\r\nto London to complain of Drake, hence Anda's letter was addressed\r\nto Backhouse, who took Fell's place. Anda, who months since had\r\nrefused to negotiate or treat with Drake, still claimed to be\r\nstyled Captain-General. Backhouse replied that he was ignorant of\r\nthe Spaniards' statutes or laws, but that he knew the Governor was\r\nthe Archbishop. Anda thereupon spread the report that the British\r\nCommander had forged the Preliminaries of Peace because he could no\r\nlonger hold out in warfare. The British necessarily had to send to the\r\nprovinces to purchase provisions, and Anda caused their forage parties\r\nto be attacked, so that the war really continued, in spite of the news\r\nof peace, until January 30, 1764. On this day the Archbishop died,\r\nsorely grieved at the situation, and weighed down with cares. He had\r\nengaged to pay four millions of pesos and surrender the Islands, but\r\ncould he indeed have refused any terms? The British were in possession;\r\nand these conditions were dictated at the point of the bayonet.\r\n\r\nImmediately after the funeral of the Archbishop, Anda received\r\ndespatches from the King of Spain, by way of China, confirming the news\r\nof peace to his Governor at Manila. Then the British acknowledged\r\nAnda as Governor, and proceeded to evacuate the city. But rival\r\nfactions were not so easily set aside, and fierce quarrels ensued\r\nbetween the respective parties of Anda, Villa Corta, and Ustariz\r\nas to who should be Governor and receive the city officially from\r\nthe British. Anda, being actually in command of the troops, held\r\nthe strongest position. The conflict was happily terminated by the\r\narrival at Marinduque Island of the newly-appointed Gov.-General,\r\nfrom Spain, Don Francisco de La Torre. A galley was sent there by\r\nAnda to bring His Excellency to Luzon, and he proceeded to Bacolor,\r\nwhere Anda resigned the Government to him on March 17, 1764.\r\n\r\nLa Torre sent a message to Backhouse and Brereton--the commanding\r\nofficers at Manila and Cavite,--stating that he was ready to take\r\nover the city in due form, and he thereupon took up his residence\r\nin Santa Cruz, placed a Spanish guard with sentinels from that\r\nward as far as the Pontoon Bridge (Puente de Barcas, which then\r\noccupied the site of the present Puente de Espana), where the British\r\nadvance-guard was, and friendly communication took place. Governor\r\nDrake was indignant at being ignored in all these proceedings, and\r\nordered the Spanish Governor to withdraw his guards, under threat of\r\nappealing to force. Backhouse and Brereton resented this rudeness and\r\nordered the troops under arms to arrest Drake, whose hostile action,\r\ndue to jealousy, they declared unwarrantable. Drake, being apprised\r\nof their intentions, escaped from the city with his suite, embarked\r\non board a frigate, and sailed off.\r\n\r\nLa Torre was said to be indisposed on the day appointed for receiving\r\nthe city. Some assert that he feigned indisposition as he did not wish\r\nto arouse Anda's animosity, and desired to afford him an opportunity\r\nof displaying himself as a delegate, at least, of the highest local\r\nauthority by receiving the city from the British, whilst he pampered\r\nhis pride by allowing him to enter triumphantly into it. As the city\r\nexchanged masters, the Spanish flag was hoisted once more on the Fort\r\nof Santiago amidst the hurrahs of the populace, artillery salutes,\r\nand the ringing of the church bells.\r\n\r\nBefore embarking, Brereton offered to do justice to any claims\r\nwhich might legitimately be established against the British\r\nauthorities. Hence a sloop lent to Drake, valued at P4,000,\r\nwas paid for to the Jesuits, and the P3,000 paid to ransom Villa\r\nCorta's life was returned, Brereton remarking, that if the sentence\r\nagainst him were valid, it should have been executed at the time,\r\nbut it could not be commuted by money payment. At the instance of the\r\nBritish authorities, a free pardon was granted and published to the\r\nChinese, few of whom, however, confided in it, and many left with\r\nthe retiring army. Brereton, with his forces, embarked for India,\r\nafter despatching a packet-boat to restore the Sultan of Sulu to\r\nhis throne. In connection with this expedition, 150 British troops\r\ntemporarily remained on the Island of Balambangan, near Balabac Island,\r\nand Anda sent a messenger to inquire about this. The reply came that\r\nthe Moros, in return for British friendliness, invited the hundred\r\nand fifty to a feast and treacherously slew 144 of them.\r\n\r\nDuring this convulsed period, great atrocities were\r\ncommitted. Unfortunately the common felons were released by the British\r\nfrom their prisons, and used their liberty to perpetrate murders and\r\nrobbery in alliance with those always naturally bent that way. So\r\ngreat did this evil become, so bold were the marauders, that in time\r\nthey formed large parties, infested highways, attacked plantations,\r\nand the poor peasantry had to flee, leaving their cattle and all\r\ntheir belongings in their power. Several avenged themselves of the\r\nfriars for old scores--others settled accounts with those Europeans\r\nwho had tyrannized over them of old. The Chinese, whether so-called\r\nChristians or pagans, declared for and aided the British.\r\n\r\nThe proceedings of the choleric Simon de Anda y Salazar were approved\r\nby his Sovereign, but his impetuous disposition drove from him\r\nhis best counsellors, whilst those who were bold enough to uphold\r\ntheir opinions against his, were accused of connivance with the\r\nBritish. Communications with Europe were scant indeed in those days,\r\nbut Anda could not have been altogether ignorant of the causes of\r\nthe war, which terminated with the Treaty of Paris.\r\n\r\nA few months afterwards Anda returned to Spain and was received\r\nwith favour by the King, who created him a Cavalier of the Order of\r\nCharles III. with a pension of 4,000 reales (about L40), and awarded\r\nhim a pension of 3,000 pesos, and on November 6, 1767, appointed\r\nhim a Councillor of Castile. In the course of the next three years\r\nGov.-General Jose Raon, who superseded La Torre, had fallen into\r\ndisgrace, and in 1770 Anda was appointed to the governor-generalship\r\nof the Islands, specially charged to carry out the royal will with\r\nrespect to the expulsion of the Jesuits and the defence of Crown\r\nrights in ecclesiastical matters.\r\n\r\nAnda at once found himself in conflict with the Jesuits, the friars,\r\nand the out-going Gov.-General Raon. As soon as Raon vacated his\r\npost, Anda, as Gov.-General, had his predecessor confined in the Fort\r\nof Santiago, where he died. At the same time he sent back to Spain\r\ntwo magistrates who had sided with Raon, imprisoned other judges,\r\nand banished military officers from the capital. Anda's position\r\nwas a very peculiar one. A partisan of the friars at heart, he had\r\nundertaken the defence of Crown interests against them, but, in a\r\nmeasure, he was able to palliate the bitterness he thus created by\r\nexpelling the Jesuits, who were an eyesore to the friars. The Jesuits\r\nmight easily have promoted a native revolt against their departure,\r\nbut they meekly submitted to the decree of banishment and left the\r\nIslands, taking away nothing but their clothing. Having rid himself of\r\nhis rivals and the Jesuits, Anda was constantly haunted by the fear\r\nof fresh conflict with the British. He had the city walls repaired\r\nand created a fleet of ships built in the provinces of Pangasinan,\r\nCavite, and Zambales, consisting of one frigate of war with 18 cannon,\r\nanother with 32 cannon, besides 14 vessels of different types,\r\ncarrying a total of 98 cannon and 12 swivel guns, all in readiness\r\nfor the British who never reappeared.\r\n\r\nBorn on October 28, 1709, in the Province of Alava, Spain, Simon\r\nde Anda's irascible temper, his vanity, and his extravagant love\r\nof power created enmities and brought trouble upon himself at every\r\nstep. Exhausted by six years of continual strife in his private and\r\nofficial capacities, he retired to the Austin Friars' Hospital of\r\nSan Juan de Dios, in Cavite, where, on October 30, 1776, he expired,\r\nmuch to the relief of his numerous adversaries. The last resting-place\r\nof his mortal remains is behind the altar of the Cathedral, marked by\r\na tablet; and a monument erected to his memory--107 years after his\r\ndeath--stands on the quayside at the end of the Paseo de Santa Lucia,\r\nnear the Fort of Santiago, Manila.\r\n\r\nConsequent on the troubled state of the Colony, a serious rebellion\r\narose in Ylogan (Cagayan Province) amongst the Timava natives, who\r\nflogged the Commandant, and declared they would no longer pay tribute\r\nto the Spaniards. The revolt spread to Ilocos and Pangasinan; in the\r\nlatter province Don Fernando Araya raised a troop of 30 Spaniards\r\nwith firearms, and 400 friendly natives with bows and arrows, and\r\nafter great slaughter of the rebels the ringleaders were caught,\r\nand tranquillity was restored by the gallows.\r\n\r\nA rising far more important occurred in Ilocos Sur. The _Alcalde_\r\nwas deposed, and escaped after he had been forced to give up his\r\nstaff of office. The leader of this revolt was a cunning and wily\r\nManila native, named Diego de Silan, who persuaded the people to cease\r\npaying tribute and declare against the Spaniards, who, he pointed out,\r\nwere unable to resist the English. The City of Vigan was in great\r\ncommotion. The Vicar-General parleyed in vain with the natives; then,\r\nat the head of his troops, he dispersed the rebels, some of whom were\r\ntaken prisoners. But the bulk of the rioters rallied and attacked,\r\nand burnt down part of the city. The loyal natives fled before the\r\nflames. The Vicar-General's house was taken, and the arms in it were\r\nseized. All the Austin friars within a large surrounding neighbourhood\r\nhad to ransom themselves by money payments. Silan was then acknowledged\r\nas chief over a large territory north and south of Vigan. He appointed\r\nhis lieutenants, and issued a manifesto declaring Jesus of Nazareth\r\nto be Captain-General of the place, and that he was His _Alcalde_\r\nfor the promotion of the Catholic religion and dominion of the King\r\nof Spain. His manifesto was wholly that of a religious fanatic. He\r\nobliged the natives to attend Mass, to confess, and to see that their\r\nchildren went to school. In the midst of all this pretended piety,\r\nhe stole cattle and exacted ransoms for the lives of all those who\r\ncould pay them; he levied a tax of P100 on each friar. Under the\r\npretence of keeping out the British, he placed sentinels in all\r\ndirections to prevent news reaching the terrible Simon de Anda. But\r\nAnda, though fully informed by an Austin friar of what was happening,\r\nhad not sufficient troops to march north. He sent a requisition to\r\nSilan to present himself within nine days, under penalty of arrest\r\nas a traitor. Whilst this order was published, vague reports were\r\nintentionally spread that the Spaniards were coming to Ilocos in\r\ngreat force. Many deserted Silan, but he contrived to deceive even\r\nthe clergy and others by his feigned piety. Silan sent presents to\r\nManila for the British, acknowledging the King of England to be his\r\nlegitimate Sovereign. The British Governor sent, in return, a vessel\r\nbearing despatches to Silan, appointing him _Alcalde_. Elated with\r\npride, Silan at once made this public. The natives were undeceived,\r\nfor they had counted on him to deliver them from the British; now, to\r\ntheir dismay, they saw him the authorized magistrate of the invader. He\r\ngave orders to make all the Austin friars prisoners, saying that the\r\nBritish would send other clergy in their stead. The friars surrendered\r\nthemselves without resistance and joined their Bishop near Vigan,\r\nawaiting the pleasure of Silan. The Bishop excommunicated Silan, and\r\nthen he released some of the priests. The christian natives having\r\nrefused to slay the friars, a secret compact was being made, with\r\nthis object, with the mountain tribes, when a Spanish half-caste\r\nnamed Vicos obtained the Bishop's benediction and killed Silan;\r\nand the Ilocos rebellion, which had lasted from December 14, 1762,\r\nto May 28, 1763, ended.\r\n\r\nNot until a score of little battles had been fought were the numerous\r\nriots in the provinces quelled. The loyal troops were divided into\r\nsections, and marched north in several directions, until peace was\r\nrestored by March, 1765. Zuniga says that the Spaniards lost in these\r\nriots about 70 Europeans and 140 natives, whilst they cost the rebels\r\nquite 10,000 men.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe submission made to the Spaniards, in the time of Legaspi, of the\r\nManila and Tondo chiefs, was but of local importance, and by no means\r\nimplied a total pacific surrender of the whole Archipelago; for each\r\ndistrict had yet to be separately conquered. In many places a bold\r\nstand was made for independence, but the superior organization and\r\nscience of the European forces invariably brought them final victory.\r\n\r\nThe numerous revolutionary protests registered in history against\r\nthe Spanish dominion show that the natives, from the days of\r\nLegaspi onwards, only yielded to a force which they repeatedly, in\r\neach generation, essayed to overthrow. But it does not necessarily\r\nfollow that either the motives which inspired the leaders of these\r\nsocial disturbances, or the acts themselves, were, in every case,\r\nlaudable ones.\r\n\r\nThe Pampanga natives were among the first to submit, but a few years\r\nafterwards they were in open mutiny against their masters, who, they\r\nalleged, took their young men from their homes to form army corps,\r\nand busily employed the able-bodied men remaining in the district to\r\ncut timber for Government requirements and furnish provisions to the\r\ncamp and to the Arsenal at Cavite.\r\n\r\nIn 1622 the natives of Bojol Island erected an oratory in the mountain\r\nin honour of an imaginary deity, and revolted against the tyranny of\r\nthe Jesuit missionaries. They proclaimed their intention to regain\r\ntheir liberty, and freedom from the payment of tribute to foreigners,\r\nand taxes to a Church they did not believe in. Several towns and\r\nchurches were burnt, and Catholic images were desecrated, but the\r\nrebels were dispersed by the Governor of Cebu, who, with a considerable\r\nnumber of troops, pursued them into the interior. In the same island\r\na more serious rising was caused in 1744 by the despotism of a Jesuit\r\npriest named Morales, who arrogated to himself governmental rights,\r\nordering the apprehension of natives who did not attend Mass, and\r\nexercising his sacerdotal functions according to his own caprice. The\r\nnatives resisted these abuses, and a certain Dagohoy, whose brother's\r\nbody had been left uninterred to decompose by the priest's orders,\r\norganized a revenge party, and swore to pay the priest in his own\r\ncoin. The Jesuit was captured and executed, and his corpse was left\r\nfour days in the sun to corrupt. Great numbers of disaffected natives\r\nflocked to Dagohoy's standard. Their complaint was, that whilst\r\nthey risked their lives in foreign service for the sole benefit of\r\ntheir European masters, their homes were wrecked and their wives and\r\nfamilies maltreated to recover the tribute. Dagohoy, with his people,\r\nmaintained his independence for the space of 35 years, during which\r\nperiod it was necessary to employ constantly detachments of troops\r\nto check the rebels' raids on private property. On the expulsion of\r\nthe Jesuits from the Colony, Recoleto friars went to Bojol, and then\r\nDagohoy and his partisans submitted to the Government on the condition\r\nof all receiving a full pardon.\r\n\r\nIn 1622 an insurrection was set on foot in Leyte Island against Spanish\r\nrule, and the Governor of Cebu went there with 40 vessels, carrying\r\ntroops and war material, to co-operate with the local Governor against\r\nthe rebels. The native leader was made prisoner, and his head placed\r\non a high pole to strike terror into the populace. Another prisoner\r\nwas garrotted, four more were publicly executed by being shot with\r\narrows, and another was burnt.\r\n\r\nIn 1629 an attempt was made in the Province of Surigao (then called\r\nCaraga), in the east of Mindanao Island, to throw off the Spanish\r\nyoke. Several churches were burnt and four priests were killed\r\nby the rebels, and the rising was only quelled after three years'\r\nguerilla warfare.\r\n\r\nIn 1649 the Gov.-General decided to supply the want of men in the\r\nArsenal at Cavite and the increasing necessity for troops, by pressing\r\nthe natives of Samar Island into the King's service. Thereupon a native\r\nheadman named Sumoroy killed the priest of Ybabao, on the east coast\r\nof Samar, and led the mob who sacked and burnt the churches along\r\nthe coast. The Governor at Catbalogan got together a few men, and\r\nsent them into the mountains with orders to send him back the head\r\nof Sumoroy, but instead of obeying they joined the rebels and sent\r\nhim a pig's head. The revolt increased, and General Andres Lopez\r\nAzaldegui was despatched to the island with full powers from the\r\nGov.-General, whilst he was supported on the coast by armed vessels\r\nfrom Zamboanga. Sumoroy fled to the hills, but his mother was found\r\nin a hut; and the invading party wreaked their vengeance on her by\r\nliterally pulling her to pieces. Sumoroy was at length betrayed by\r\nhis own people, who carried his head to the Spanish Captain, and\r\nthis officer had it exhibited on a pole in the village. Some years\r\nafterwards another rebel chief surrendered, under a pardon obtained\r\nfor him by the priests, but the military authorities imprisoned and\r\nthen hanged him.\r\n\r\nThe riots of 1649 extended to other provinces for the same cause. In\r\nAlbay, the parish priest of Sorsogon had to flee for his life; in\r\nMasbate Island, a sub-lieutenant was killed; in Zamboanga, a priest\r\nwas murdered; in Cebu, a Spaniard was assassinated; and in Surigao\r\n(then called Caraga) and Butuan, many Europeans fell victims to the\r\nfury of the populace. To quell these disturbances, Captain Gregorio de\r\nCastillo, stationed at Butuan, was ordered to march against the rebels\r\nwith a body of infantry, but bloodshed was avoided by the Captain\r\npublishing a general pardon in the name of the King, and crowds of\r\ninsurgents came to the camp in consequence. The King's name, however,\r\nwas sullied, for very few of those who surrendered ever regained their\r\nliberty. They were sent prisoners to Manila, where a few were pardoned,\r\nothers were executed, and the majority became galley-slaves.\r\n\r\nIn 1660 there was again a serious rising in Pampanga, the natives\r\nobjecting to cut timber for the Cavite Arsenal without payment. The\r\nrevolt spread to Pangasinan Province, where a certain Andres Malong\r\nwas declared king, and he in turn gave to another--Pedro Gumapos--the\r\ntitle of \"Count.\" Messages were sent to Zambales and other adjacent\r\nprovinces ordering the natives to kill the Spaniards, under pain of\r\nincurring \"King\" Malong's displeasure.\r\n\r\nThree army-corps were formed by the rebels: one of 6,000 men, under\r\nMelchor de Veras, for the conquest of Pampanga; another of 3,000\r\nmen, led by the titular count Gumapos, to annex Ilocos and Cagayan,\r\nwhilst the so-called King Malong took the field against the Pangasinan\r\npeople at the head of 2,000 followers. Ilocos Province declared in his\r\nfavour, and furnished a body of insurgents under a chief named Juan\r\nManzano, whilst everywhere on the march the titular king's troops\r\nincreased until they numbered about 40,000 men. On the way many\r\nSpaniards--priests and laymen--were killed. The Gov.-General sent by\r\nland to Pampanga 200 Spanish troops, 400 Pampangos and half-breeds,\r\nwell armed and provisioned, and Mount Arayat was fortified and\r\ngarrisoned by 500 men. By sea: two galleys, six small vessels, and\r\nfour cargo launches--carrying 700 Spaniards and half-breeds, and 30\r\nPampangos--went to Bolinao, in Zambales Province. The rebels were\r\neverywhere routed, and their chiefs were hanged--some in Pampanga\r\nand others in Manila.\r\n\r\nAlmost each generation has called forth the strong arm of the conqueror\r\nto extinguish the flame of rebellion in one island or another, the\r\nrevolt being sometimes due to sacerdotal despotism, and at other\r\ntimes to official rapacity.\r\n\r\nIn the last century, prior to 1896, several vain attempts to subvert\r\nSpanish authority were made, notably in 1811 in Ilocos, where the\r\nfanatics sought to establish a new religion and set up a new god. An\r\nattempt was then made to enlist the wild tribes in a plot to murder\r\nall the Spaniards, but it was opportunely discovered by the friars\r\nand suppressed before it could be carried out.\r\n\r\nIn June, 1823, an order was received from Spain to the effect that\r\nofficers commissioned in the Peninsula should have precedence of all\r\nthose appointed in the Colony, so that, for instance, a lieutenant\r\nfrom Spain would hold local rank above a Philippine major. The\r\nPhilippine officers protested against this anomaly, alleging that the\r\ncommissions granted to them in the name of the Sovereign were as good\r\nas those granted in Spain. The Gov.-General refused to listen to the\r\nobjections put forward, and sent Captain Andres Novales and others on\r\nboard a ship bound for Mindanao. Novales, however, escaped to shore,\r\nand, in conspiracy with a certain Ruiz, attempted to overthrow the\r\nGovernment. At midnight all Manila was aroused by the cry of \"Long\r\nlive the Emperor Novales!\" Disaffected troops promenaded the city;\r\nthe people sympathized with the movement; flags were waved as the\r\nrebels passed through the streets; the barrack used by Novales'\r\nregiment was seized; the Cathedral and Town Hall were occupied,\r\nand at 6 o'clock in the morning Andres Novales marched to Fort\r\nSantiago, which was under the command of his brother Antonio. To his\r\ngreat surprise, the brother Antonio stoutly refused to join in the\r\nrising, and Andres' expostulations and exhortations were finally\r\nmet with a threat to fire on him if he did not retire. Meanwhile,\r\nthe Gov.-General remained in hiding until he heard that the fort was\r\nholding out against Andres' assault, when he sent troops to assist\r\nthe defenders. Hemmed in between the fort and the troops outside,\r\nAndres Novales and Ruiz made their escape, but they were soon taken\r\nprisoners. Andres Novales was found hiding underneath the drawbridge\r\nof the _Puerta Real_. The Gov.-General at once ordered Andres Novales,\r\nRuiz, and Antonio Novales to be executed. The Town Council then went\r\nin a body to the Gov.-General to protest against the loyal defender\r\nof Fort Santiago being punished simply because he was Andres Novales'\r\nbrother. The Gov.-General, however, threatened to have shot any one\r\nwho should say a word in favour of the condemned.\r\n\r\nIn a garden of the episcopal palace, near the ancient _Puerta del\r\nPostigo_, the execution of the three condemned men was about to take\r\nplace, and crowds of people assembled to witness it. At the critical\r\nmoment an assessor of the Supreme Court shouted to the Gov.-General\r\nthat to take the life of the loyal defender of the fort, solely\r\non the ground of his relationship to the rebel leader, would be an\r\niniquity. His words found a sympathetic echo among the crowd, and the\r\nGov.-General, deadly pale with rage, yielded to this demonstration of\r\npublic opinion. Antonio Novales was pardoned, but the strain on his\r\nnerves weakened his brain, and he lived for many years a semi-idiot\r\nin receipt of a monthly pension of 14 pesos.\r\n\r\nIn 1827 the standard of sedition was raised in Cebu and a few towns\r\nof that island, but these disturbances were speedily quelled through\r\nthe influence of the Spanish friars.\r\n\r\nIn 1828 a conspiracy of a separatist tendency was discovered, and\r\naverted without bloodshed.\r\n\r\nIn 1835 Feliciano Paran took the field against the Spaniards in Cavite\r\nProvince, and held out so effectually that the Gov.-General came to\r\nterms with him and afterwards deported him to the Ladrone Islands.\r\n\r\nIn 1836 there was much commotion of a revolutionary character, the\r\npeculiar feature of it being the existence of pro-friar and anti-friar\r\nnative parties, the former seeking to subject absolutely the civil\r\ngovernment to ecclesiastical control. [43]\r\n\r\nIn 1841 a student for the priesthood, named Apolinario de la Cruz,\r\naffected with religious mania, placed himself at the head of a\r\nfanatical party in Tayabas, ostensibly for the purpose of establishing\r\na religious sect. Some thousands of natives joined the movement,\r\nand troops had to be sent to suppress the rising. Having assumed the\r\ntitle of King of the Tagalogs, he pretended to have direct heavenly\r\nsupport, telling the ignorant masses that he was invulnerable and that\r\nthe soldiers' bullets would fly from them like chaff before the wind.\r\n\r\nIn 1844, during a rising at Jimamaylan, in Negros Island, the\r\nSpanish Governor was killed. The revolt is said to have been due to\r\nthe Governor having compelled the State prisoners to labour for his\r\nprivate account.\r\n\r\nIn 1854 a Spanish half-caste, named Cuesta, came back from Spain with\r\nthe rank of major, and at once broke out into open rebellion. The cry\r\nwas for independence, and four Luzon provinces rose in his support;\r\nbut the movement was crushed by the troops and Cuesta was hanged.\r\n\r\nIn 1870 a certain Camerino raised rebellion in Cavite province, and\r\nafter many unsuccessful attempts to capture him he came to terms with\r\nthe Gov.-General, who gave him a salaried employment for a couple\r\nof years and then had him executed on the allegation that he was\r\nconcerned in the rising of Cavite Arsenal.\r\n\r\nIn 1871 there existed a Secret Society of reformers who used to\r\nmeet in Santa Cruz (Manila) at the house of the Philippine priest,\r\nFather Mariano. [44] From the house proper a narrow staircase led\r\nto a cistern about 25 feet square, in the side of which there was a\r\ndoor which closed perfectly. The cistern was divided into two unequal\r\nparts, the top compartment being full of water, whilst the lower part\r\nserved as the reformers' conference room, so that if search were made,\r\nthe cistern was, in fact, a cistern.\r\n\r\nAmong the members of this confraternity were Father Agustin Mendoza,\r\nthe parish priest of Santa Cruz; Dr. Jose Burgos, also a native priest;\r\nMaximo Paterno, the father of Pedro A. Paterno; Ambrosio Rianzares\r\nBautista; and others still living (some personally known to me), under\r\nthe presidency of Jose Maria Basa (now residing in Hong-Kong). This\r\nSecret Society demanded reforms, and published in Madrid their organ,\r\n_Eco de Filipinas_, copies of which reached the Islands. The copy for\r\nthe paper was the result of the society's deliberations. The monks,\r\nincensed at its publication, were, for a long time, puzzled to find\r\nout whence the information emanated. Many of the desired reforms\r\nclosely affected the position of the regular clergy, the Philippine\r\npriests, led by Dr. Burgos, urging the fulfilment of the Council of\r\nTrent decisions, which forbade the friars to hold benefices unless\r\nthere were no secular priests available.\r\n\r\nIt appears that the friars, nevertheless, secured these ecclesiastical\r\npreferments by virtue of Papal Bulls of Pius V. and subsequent Popes,\r\nwho authorized friars to act as parish priests, not in perpetuity,\r\nbut so long as secular clergymen were insufficient in number to attend\r\nto the cure of souls. The native party consequently declared that\r\nthe friars retained their incumbencies illegally and by intrusion, in\r\nview of the sufficiency of Philippine secular priests. Had the Council\r\nof Trent enactments been carried out to the letter, undoubtedly the\r\nreligious communities in the Philippines would have been doomed to\r\ncomparative political impotence. The friars, therefore, sought to\r\nembroil Dr. Burgos and his party in overt acts of sedition, in order\r\nto bring about their downfall and so quash the movement. To this end\r\nthey contrived to draw a number of Manila and Cavite natives into a\r\nconspiracy to subvert the Spanish Government. The native soldiers of\r\nthe Cavite garrison were induced to co-operate in what they believed\r\nto be a genuine endeavour to throw off the Spanish dominion. They\r\nwere told that rockets fired off in Manila would be the signal for\r\nrevolt. It happened, however, that they mistook the fireworks of a\r\nsuburban feast for the agreed signal and precipitated the outbreak\r\nin Cavite without any support in the capital. The disaffected\r\nsoldiers seized the Arsenal, whilst others attacked the influential\r\nEuropeans. Colonel Sabas was sent over to Cavite to quell the riot,\r\nand after a short, but stubborn resistance, the rebels were overcome,\r\ndisarmed, and then formed up in line. On Colonel Sabas asking if there\r\nwere any one who would not cry, \"_Viva Espana!_\" one man stepped\r\nforward a few paces out of the ranks. The Colonel shot him dead,\r\nand the remainder were marched to prison.\r\n\r\nThe ruse operated effectually on the lay authorities, who yielded to\r\nthe Spanish monks' demand that the extreme penalty of the law should\r\nbe inflicted upon their opponents. Thereupon, Dr. Jose Burgos (aged\r\n30 years), Father Jacinto Zamora (aged 35 years), and Father Mariano\r\nGomez [45] (a dotard, 85 years of age) were executed (February 28,\r\n1872) on the _Luneta_, the fashionable esplanade outside the walled\r\ncity, facing the sea.\r\n\r\nThe friars then caused a bill of indictment to be put forward\r\nby the Public Prosecutor, in which it was alleged that a\r\nRevolutionary Government had been projected. The native clergy were\r\nterror-stricken. It was decreed that whilst the Filipinos already\r\nacting as parish priests would not be deposed, no further appointments\r\nwould be made, and the most the Philippine novice could aspire to\r\nwould be the position of coadjutor--practically servant--to the friar\r\nincumbent. Moreover, the opportunity was taken to banish to the Ladrone\r\n(Marianas) Islands many members of wealthy and influential families\r\nwhose passive resistance was an eyesore to the friars. Among these\r\nwas the late Maximo Paterno (q.v.), the father of Pedro A. Paterno;\r\nalso Dr. Antonio M. Regidor y Jurado and Jose Maria Basa, who are\r\nstill living. [46]\r\n\r\nIn 1889 I visited a penal settlement--La Colonia Agricola de San\r\nRamon--in Mindanao Island, and during my stay at the director's house\r\nI was every day served at table by a native convict who was said to\r\nhave been nominated by the Cavite rebels to the Civil Governorship of\r\nManila. There was, however, no open trial from which the public could\r\nform an opinion of the merits of the case, and the idea of subverting\r\nthe Spanish Government would appear to have been a fantastic concoction\r\nfor the purposes stated. But from that date there never ceased to\r\nexist a secret revolutionary agitation which culminated in the events\r\nof 1898.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VIII\r\n\r\nThe Chinese\r\n\r\n\r\nLong before the foundation of Manila by Legaspi in 1571 the\r\nChinese traded with these Islands. Their _locus standi_, however,\r\nwas invariably a critical one, and their commercial transactions\r\nwith the semi-barbarous Philippine Islanders were always conducted\r\nafloat. Often their junks were boarded and pillaged by the natives,\r\nbut, in spite of the immense risk incurred, the Chinese lacked nothing\r\nin their active pursuit. Their chief home port was Canton.\r\n\r\nLegaspi soon perceived the advantages which would accrue to his\r\nconquest by fostering the development of commerce with these Islands;\r\nand, as an inducement to the Chinese to continue their traffic,\r\nhe severely punished all acts of violence committed against them.\r\n\r\nIn the course of time the Chinese had gained sufficient confidence\r\nunder European protection, to come ashore with their wares. In 1588,\r\nChinese were already paying rent for the land they occupied. Some\r\nwriters assert that they propagated their religious doctrines as well\r\nas their customs, but nothing can be found to confirm this statement,\r\nand a knowledge of Chinese habits inclines one to think it most\r\nimprobable. In their trading junks they frequently carried their\r\nidols, as a Romish priest carries his missal when he travels. The\r\nnatives may have imitated the Chinese religious rites years before the\r\nSpaniards came. There is no evidence adduced to prove that they made\r\nany endeavour to proselytize the natives as the Spaniards did. On the\r\nother hand, there is reason to believe that some idols, lost by the\r\nChinese in shipwreck and piratical attacks, have been, and still are,\r\nrevered by the natives as authenticated miraculous images of Christian\r\nSaints (_vide_ \"Holy Child of Cebu\" and \"Our Lady of Cagsaysay\").\r\n\r\nThe Chinese contributed, in a large measure, to bring about a state of\r\norder and prosperity in the new Colony, by the introduction of their\r\nsmall trades and industries; and their traffic in the interior, and\r\nwith China, was really beneficial, in those times, to the object which\r\nthe conquerors had in view. So numerous, however, did they become,\r\nthat it was found necessary to regulate the growing commerce and the\r\n_modus vivendi_ of the foreign traders.\r\n\r\nIn the bad weather they were unable to go to and from their junks,\r\nand, fearing lest under such circumstances the trade would fall off,\r\nthe Government determined to provide them with a large building called\r\nthe _Alcayceria_. The contract for its construction was offered to any\r\nprivate person or corporation willing to take it up on the following\r\nterms, viz.:--The original cost, the annual expense of maintenance,\r\nand the annual rents received from the Chinese tenants were to be\r\nequally shared by the Government and the contractor. The contract was\r\naccepted by a certain Fernando de Mier y Noriega, who was appointed\r\nbailiff of the _Alcayceria_ for life, and the employment was to be\r\nhereditary in his family, at a salary of 50 pesos per month. However,\r\nwhen the plan was submitted to the Government, it was considered\r\ntoo extensive, and was consequently greatly reduced, the Government\r\ndefraying the total cost (P 48,000). The bailiff's salary was likewise\r\nreduced to P 25 per month, and only the condition of sharing rent\r\nand expense of preservation was maintained. The _Alcayceria_, was\r\na square of shops, with a back store, and one apartment above each\r\ntenement. It was inaugurated in 1580, in the Calle de San Fernando,\r\nin Binondo, opposite to where is now the Harbour-Master's Office,\r\nand within firing range of the forts. In the course of years this\r\nbecame a ruin, and on the same site Government Stores were built in\r\n1856. These, too, were wrecked in their turn by the great earthquake\r\nof 1863. In the meantime, the Chinese had long ago spread far beyond\r\nthe limits of the _Alcayceria_, and another centre had been provided\r\nfor them within the City of Manila. This was called the _Parian_,\r\nwhich is the Mexican word for market-place. It was demolished by\r\nGovernment order in 1860, but the entrance to the city at that part\r\n(constructed in 1782) still retains the name of _Puerta del Parian_.\r\n\r\nHence it will be seen that from the time of the conquest, and for\r\ngenerations following, the Spanish authorities offered encouragement\r\nand protection to the Chinese.\r\n\r\nDr. Antonio Morga, in his work on the Philippines, p. 349, writes\r\n(at the close of the 16th century): \"It is true the town cannot exist\r\nwithout the Chinese, as they are workers in all trades and business,\r\nand very industrious and work for small wages.\"\r\n\r\nJuan de la Concepcion writes [47] (referring to the beginning of\r\nthe 17th century); \"Without the trade and commerce of the Chinese,\r\nthese dominions could not have subsisted.\" The same writer estimates\r\nthe number of Chinese in the Colony in 1638 at 33,000. [48]\r\n\r\nIn 1686 the policy of fixing the statutory maximum number of Chinese\r\nat 6,000 was discussed, but commercial conveniences outweighed its\r\nadoption. Had the measure been carried out, it was proposed to lodge\r\nthem all in one place within easy cannon range, in view of a possible\r\nrising.\r\n\r\nIn 1755 it was resolved to expel all non-Christian Chinese, but a term\r\nwas allowed for the liquidation of their affairs and withdrawal. By\r\nJune 30, 1755, the day fixed for their departure from Manila, 515\r\nChinamen had been sharp enough to obtain baptism as Christians,\r\nin order to evade the edict, besides 1,108 who were permitted to\r\nremain because they were studying the mysteries and intricacies of\r\nChristianity. 2,070 were banished from Manila, the expulsion being\r\nrigidly enforced on those newly arriving in junks.\r\n\r\nExcept a few Europeans and a score of Western Asiatics, the Chinese who\r\nremained were the only merchants in the Archipelago. The natives had\r\nneither knowledge, tact, energy, nor desire to compete with them. The\r\nChinese were a boon to the Colony, for, without them, living would\r\nhave been far dearer--commodities and labour of all kinds more scarce,\r\nand the export and import trade much embarrassed. The Chinese and\r\nthe Japanese are really the people who gave to the natives the first\r\nnotions of trade, industry, and fruitful work. The Chinese taught them,\r\namongst many other useful things, the extraction of saccharine juice\r\nfrom the sugar-cane, the manufacture of sugar, and the working of\r\nwrought iron. They introduced into the Colony the first sugar-mills\r\nwith vertical stone crushers, and iron boiling-pans.\r\n\r\nThe history of the last 150 years shows that the Chinese, although\r\ntolerated, were always regarded by the Spanish colonists as an\r\nunwelcome race, and the natives have learnt, from example, to despise\r\nthem. From time to time, especially since the year 1763, the feeling\r\nagainst them has run very high.\r\n\r\nThe public clamoured for restrictions on their arrival, impediments\r\nto the traffic of those already established there, intervention of\r\nthe authorities with respect to their dwellings and mode of living,\r\nand not a few urged their total expulsion. Indeed, such influence\r\nwas brought to bear on the Indian Council at Madrid during the\r\ntemporary Governorship of Juan Arechedera, Bishop of Nueva Segovia\r\n(1745-50), that the Archbishop received orders to expel the Chinese\r\nfrom the Islands; but, on the ground that to have done so would have\r\n_prejudiced public interests_, he simply archived the decree. Even up\r\nto the close of Spanish rule, the authorities and the national trading\r\nclass considered the question from very distinct points of view;\r\nfor the fact is, that only the mildest action was taken--just enough\r\nto appease the wild demands of the people. Still, the Chinaman was\r\nalways subject to the ebb and flow of the tide of official goodwill,\r\nand only since 1843 were Chinese shops allowed to be opened on the\r\nsame terms as other foreigners. There are now streets of Chinese shops.\r\n\r\nThe Chinaman is always ready to sell at any price which will leave him\r\na trifling nett gain, whereas the native, having earned sufficient\r\nfor his immediate wants, would stubbornly refuse to sell his wares\r\nexcept at an enormous profit.\r\n\r\nAgain, but for Chinese coolie competition, [49] constant labour\r\nfrom the natives would have been almost unprocurable. The native\r\nday-labourer would work two or three days, and then suddenly\r\ndisappear. The active Chinaman goes day after day to his task\r\n(excepting only at the time of the Chinese New Year, in January or\r\nFebruary), and can be depended upon; thus the needy native was pushed,\r\nby alien competition, to bestir himself. In my time, in the port\r\nof Yloilo, four foreign commercial houses had to incur the expense\r\nand risk of bringing Chinese coolies for loading and discharging\r\nvessels, whilst the natives coolly lounged about and absolutely\r\nrefused to work. Moreover, the exactions of the native create a\r\nserious impediment to the development of the Colony. Only a very\r\nsmall minority of the labouring class will put their hands to work\r\nwithout an advance on their wages, and will often demand it without any\r\nguarantee whatsoever. If a native is commissioned to perform any kind\r\nof service, he will refuse to stir without a sum of money beforehand,\r\nwhilst the Chinese very rarely expect payment until they have given\r\nvalue for it. Only the direst necessity will make an unskilled native\r\nwork steadily for several weeks for a wage which is only to be paid\r\nwhen due. There is scarcely a single agriculturist who is not compelled\r\nto sink a share of his capital in making advances to his labourers,\r\nwho, nevertheless, are in no way legally bound thereby to serve the\r\ncapitalist; or, whether they are or not, the fact is, that a large\r\nproportion of this capital so employed must be considered lost. There\r\nare certain lines of business quite impossible without the co-operation\r\nof Chinese, and their exclusion will be a loss to the Colony.\r\n\r\nTaxes were first levied on the Mongol traders in 1828. In\r\n1852 a general reform of the fiscal laws was introduced, and the\r\nclassification of Chinese dealers was modified. They were then divided\r\ninto four grades or classes, each paying contributions according to\r\nthe new tariff.\r\n\r\nIn 1886 the universal depression, which was first manifest in this\r\nColony in 1884, still continued. Remedies of most original character\r\nwere suggested in the public organs and private circles, and a renewed\r\nspasmodic tirade was directed against the Chinese. A petition, made\r\nand signed by numbers of the retail trading class, was addressed to\r\nthe Sovereign; but it appears to have found its last resting-place\r\nin the Colonial Secretary's waste-paper basket. The Americans in the\r\nUnited States and Mexico were in open riot against the Celestials--the\r\nGovernments of Australia had imposed a capitation tax on their entry\r\n[50]--in British Columbia there was a party disposed to throw off\r\nits allegiance to Great Britain rather than forego its agitation\r\nagainst the Chinese. Why should not the Chinese be expelled from the\r\nPhilippines, it was asked, or at least be permitted only to pursue\r\nagriculture in the Islands? In 1638, around Calamba and along the\r\nLaguna shore, they tilled the land; but the selfishness and jealousy\r\nof the natives made their permanence impossible. In 1850 the Chinese\r\nwere invited to take up agriculture, but the rancorous feeling of the\r\nnatives forced them to abandon the idea, and to seek greater security\r\nin the towns.\r\n\r\nThe chief accusation levelled against the Chinaman is, that he comes as\r\nan adventurer and makes money, which he carries away, without leaving\r\nany trace of civilization behind him. The Chinese immigrant is of the\r\nlowest social class. Is not the dream of the European adventurer, of\r\nthe same or better class, to make his pile of dollars and be off to\r\nthe land of his birth? If he spends more money in the Colony than the\r\nChinaman does, it is because he lacks the Chinaman's self-abnegation\r\nand thriftiness. Is the kind of civilization taught in the colonies\r\nby low-class European settlers superior?\r\n\r\nThe Chinaman settled in the Philippines under Spanish rule was quite\r\na different being to the obstinate, self-willed, riotous coolie in\r\nHong-Kong or Singapore. In Manila he was drilled past docility--in six\r\nmonths he became even fawning, cringing, and servile, until goaded\r\ninto open rebellion. Whatever position he might attain to, he was\r\nnever addressed (as in the British Colonies) as \"Mr.\" or \"Esqre,\" or\r\nthe equivalent, \"Senor D.,\" but always \"Chinaman ----\" (\"Chino ----\").\r\n\r\nThe total expulsion of the Chinese in Spanish times would have been\r\nhighly prejudicial to trade. Had it suited the State policy to\r\ncheck the ingress of the Chinese, nothing would have been easier\r\nthan the imposition of a P50 poll tax. To compel them to take up\r\nagriculture was out of the question in a Colony where there was so\r\nlittle guarantee for their personal safety. The frugality, constant\r\nactivity, and commendable ambition of the Celestial clashes with the\r\ndissipation, indolence and want of aim in life of the native. There\r\nis absolutely no harmony of thought, purpose, or habit between the\r\nPhilippine Malay native and the Mongol race, and the consequence of\r\nChinese coolies working on plantations without ample protection would\r\nbe frequent assassinations and open affray. Moreover, a native planter\r\ncould never manage, to his own satisfaction or interest, an estate\r\nworked with Chinese labour, but the European might. The Chinese is\r\nessentially of a commercial bent, and, in the Philippines at least,\r\nhe prefers taking his chance as to the profits, in the bubble and risk\r\nof independent speculation, rather than calmly labour at a fixed wage\r\nwhich affords no stimulus to his efforts.\r\n\r\nPlantations worked by Chinese owners with Chinese labour might nave\r\nsucceeded, but those who arrived in the Colony brought no capital, and\r\nthe Government never offered them gratuitous allotment of property. A\r\nlaw relating to the concession of State lands existed (\"_Terrenos\r\nbaldios_\" and \"_Colonias agricolas_\"), but it was enveloped in so\r\nmany entanglements and so encompassed by tardy process and intricate\r\nconditions, that few Orientals or Europeans took advantage of it.\r\n\r\nHistory records that in the year 1603 two Chinese Mandarins came to\r\nManila as Ambassadors from their Emperor to the Gov.-General of the\r\nPhilippines. They represented that a countryman of theirs had informed\r\nHis Celestial Majesty of the existence of a mountain of gold in the\r\nenvirons of Cavite, and they desired to see it. The Gov.-General\r\nwelcomed them, and they were carried ashore by their own people\r\nin ivory and gilded sedan-chairs. They wore the insignia of High\r\nMandarins, and the Governor accorded them the reception due to their\r\nexalted station. He assured them that they were entirely misinformed\r\nrespecting the mountain of gold, which could only be imaginary, but,\r\nto further convince them, he accompanied them to Cavite. The Mandarins\r\nshortly afterwards returned to their country. The greatest anxiety\r\nprevailed in Manila. Rumours circulated that a Chinese invasion was\r\nin preparation. The authorities held frequent councils, in which\r\nthe opinions were very divided. A feverish consternation overcame\r\nthe natives, who were armed, and ordered to carry their weapons\r\nconstantly. The armoury was overhauled. A war plan was discussed and\r\nadopted, and places were singled out for each division of troops. The\r\nnatives openly avowed to the Chinese that whenever they saw the\r\nfirst signs of the hostile fleet arriving they would murder them\r\nall. The Chinese were accused of having arms secreted; they were\r\npublicly insulted and maltreated; the cry was falsely raised that\r\nthe Spaniards had fixed the day for their extermination; they daily\r\nsaw weapons being cleaned and put in order, and they knew that there\r\ncould be no immediate enemy but themselves. There was, in short,\r\nevery circumstantial evidence that the fight for their existence\r\nwould ere long be forced upon them.\r\n\r\nIn this terrible position they were constrained to act on\r\nthe offensive, simply to ensure their own safety. They raised\r\nfortifications in several places outside the city, and many an\r\nunhappy Chinaman had to shoulder a weapon reluctantly with tears in\r\nhis eyes. They were traders. War and revolution were quite foreign to\r\ntheir wishes. The Christian rulers compelled them to abandon their\r\nadopted homes and their chattels, regardless of the future. What a\r\nstrange conception the Chinese must have formed of His Most Catholic\r\nMajesty! In their despair many of them committed suicide. Finally,\r\non the eve of Saint Francis' Day, the Chinese openly declared\r\nhostilities--beat their war-gongs, hoisted their flags, assaulted\r\nthe armed natives, and threatened the city. Houses were burnt, and\r\nBinondo was besieged. They fortified Tondo; and the next morning\r\nLuis Perez Dasmarinas, an ex-Gov.-General, led the troops against\r\nthem. He was joined by 100 picked Spanish soldiers under Tomas de\r\nAcuna. The nephew of the Governor and the nephew of the Archbishop\r\nrallied to the Spanish standard nearly all the flower of Castilian\r\nsoldiery--and hardly one was left to tell the tale! The bloodshed was\r\nappalling. The Chinese, encouraged by this first victory, besieged\r\nthe city, but after a prolonged struggle they were obliged to yield,\r\nas they could not provision themselves.\r\n\r\nThe retreating Chinese were pursued far from Manila along the Laguna\r\nde Bay shore, thousands of them being overtaken and slaughtered or\r\ndisabled. Reinforcements met them on the way, and drove them as far\r\nas Batangas Province and into the Morong district (now included in\r\nRizal Province). The natives were in high glee at this licence to shed\r\nblood unresisted--so in harmony with their natural instincts. It is\r\ncalculated that 24,000 Chinese were slain or captured in this revolt.\r\n\r\nThe priests affirm positively that during the defence of the city\r\nSaint Francis appeared in person on the walls to stimulate the\r\nChristians--thus the victory was ascribed to him.\r\n\r\nThis ruthless treatment of a harmless and necessary people--for up\r\nto this event they had proved themselves to be both--threatened to\r\nbring its own reward. They were the only industrious, thriving,\r\nskilful, wealth-producing portion of the population. There were\r\nno other artificers or tradespeople in the Colony. Moreover, the\r\nSpaniards were fearful lest their supplies from China of food for\r\nconsumption in Manila, [51] and manufactured articles for export to\r\nMexico, should in future be discontinued. Consequently they hastened\r\nto despatch an envoy to China to explain matters, and to reassure\r\nthe Chinese traders. Much to their surprise, they found the Viceroy\r\nof Canton little concerned about what had happened, and the junks of\r\nmerchandise again arrived as heretofore.\r\n\r\nNotwithstanding the memorable event of 1603, another struggle was\r\nmade by the Chinese 36 years afterwards. In 1639, exasperated at the\r\nofficial robbery and oppression of a certain doctor, Luis Arias do\r\nMora, and the Governor of the Laguna Province, they rose in open\r\nrebellion and killed these officials in the town of Calamba. So\r\nserious was the revolt that the Gov.-General went out against them in\r\nperson. The rebels numbered about 30,000, and sustained, for nearly\r\na year, a petty warfare all around. The images of the Saints were\r\npromenaded in the streets of Manila; it was a happy thought, for 6,000\r\nChinese coincidentally surrendered. During this conflict an edict\r\nwas published ordering all the Chinese in the provinces to be slain.\r\n\r\nIn 1660 there was another rising of these people, which terminated\r\nin a great massacre.\r\n\r\nThe Spaniards now began to reflect that they had made rather a\r\nbad bargain with the Mongol traders in the beginning, and that the\r\nGovernment would have done better had they encouraged commerce with\r\nthe Peninsula. Up to this time the Spaniards had vainly reposed on\r\ntheir laurels as conquerors. They squandered lives and treasure on\r\ninnumerable fruitless expeditions to Gamboge, Cochin China, Siam,\r\nPegu, Japan, and the Moluccas, in quest of fresh glories, instead of\r\nconcentrating their efforts in opening up this Colony and fostering\r\na Philippine export trade, as yet almost unknown, if we exclude\r\nmerchandise from China, etc., in transit to Mexico. From this period\r\nrestrictions were, little by little, placed on the introduction\r\nof Chinese; they were treated with arrogance by the Europeans and\r\nMexicans, and the jealous hatred which the native to this day feels for\r\nthe Chinaman now began to be more openly manifested. The Chinaman had,\r\nfor a long time past, been regarded by the European as a necessity--and\r\nhenceforth an unfortunate one.\r\n\r\nNevertheless, the lofty Spaniard who by favour of the King had\r\narrived in Manila to occupy an official post without an escudo too\r\nmuch in his pocket, did not disdain to accept the hospitality of\r\nthe Chinese. It was formerly their custom to secure the goodwill and\r\npersonal protection of the Spanish officials by voluntarily keeping\r\nlodging-houses ready for their reception. It is chronicled that these\r\ngratuitous residences were well furnished and provided with all the\r\nrequisites procurable on the spot. For a whole century the Spaniards\r\nwere lulled with this easy-going and felicitous state of things, whilst\r\nthe insidious Mongol, whose clear-sighted sagacity was sufficient to\r\npierce the thin veil of friendship proffered by his guest, was ever\r\nprepared for another opportunity of rising against the dominion of\r\nCastile, of which he had had so many sorry experiences since 1603. The\r\noccasion at last arrived during the British occupation of Manila in\r\n1763. The Chinese voluntarily joined the invaders, but were unable\r\nto sustain the struggle, and it is estimated that some 6,000 of them\r\nwere murdered in the provinces by order of the notorious Simon de Anda\r\n(_vide_ p. 93). They menaced the town of Pasig--near Manila--and Fray\r\nJuan de Torres, the parish priest, put himself at the head of 300\r\nnatives, by order of his Prior, Fray Andres Fuentes, to oppose them,\r\nand the Chinese were forced to retire.\r\n\r\nOn October 9, 1820, a general massacre of Chinese, British,\r\nand other foreigners took place in Manila and Cavite. Epidemic\r\ncholera had affected the capital and surrounding districts; great\r\nnumbers of natives succumbed to its malignant effects, and they\r\naccused the foreigners of having poisoned the drinking-water in\r\nthe streams. Foreign property was attacked and pillaged--even ships\r\nlying in the bay had to sail off and anchor out afar for safety. The\r\noutbreak attained such grave proportions that the clergy intervened\r\nto dissuade the populace from their hallucination. The High Host was\r\ncarried through the streets, but the rioters were only pacified when\r\nthey could find no more victims.\r\n\r\nAmongst other reforms concerning the Chinese which the Spanish\r\ncolonists and Manila natives called for in 1886, through the public\r\norgans, was that they should be forced to comply with the law\r\npromulgated in 1867, which provided that the Chinese, like all other\r\nmerchants, should keep their trade-books in the Spanish language. The\r\ndemand had the appearance of being based on certain justifiable\r\ngrounds, but in reality it was a mere ebullition of spite intended\r\nto augment the difficulties of the Chinese.\r\n\r\nThe British merchants and bankers are, by far, those who give most\r\ncredit to the Chinese. The Spanish and native creditors of the Chinese\r\nare but a small minority, taking the aggregate of their credits, and\r\ninstead of seeking malevolently to impose new hardships on the Chinese,\r\nthey could have abstained from entering into risky transactions with\r\nthem. All merchants are aware of the Chinese trading system, and none\r\nare obliged to deal with them. A foreign house would give a Chinaman\r\ncredit for, say, L300 to L400 worth of European manufactured goods,\r\nknowing full well, from personal experience, or from that of others,\r\nthat the whole value would probably never be recovered. It remained\r\na standing debt on the books of the firm. The Chinaman retailed\r\nthese goods, and brought a small sum of cash to the firm, on the\r\nunderstanding that he would get another parcel of goods, and so he\r\nwent on for years. [52] Thus the foreign merchants practically sunk\r\nan amount of capital to start their Chinese constituents. Sometimes\r\nthe acknowledged owner and responsible man in one Chinese retail\r\nestablishment would have a share in, or own, several others. If matters\r\nwent wrong, he absconded abroad, and only the one shop which he openly\r\nrepresented could be embargoed, whilst his goods were distributed\r\nover several shops under any name but his. It was always difficult\r\nto bring legal proof of this; the books were in Chinese, and the\r\nwhole business was in a state of confusion incomprehensible to any\r\nEuropean. But these risks were well known beforehand. It was only then\r\nthat the original credit had to be written off by the foreigner as a\r\nnett loss--often small when set against several years of accumulated\r\nprofits made in successive operations.\r\n\r\nThe Chinese have guilds or secret societies for their mutual\r\nprotection, and it is a well-ascertained fact that they had to\r\npay the Spanish authorities very dearly for the liberty of living\r\nat peace with their fellow-men. If the wind blew against them from\r\nofficial quarters the affair brought on the _tapis_ was hushed up by\r\na gift. These peace-offerings, at times of considerable value, were\r\nprocured by a tax privately levied on each Chinaman by the headmen of\r\ntheir guilds. In 1880-83 the Gov.-General and other high functionaries\r\nused to accept Chinese hospitality, etc.\r\n\r\nIn December, 1887, the Medal of Civil Merit was awarded to a Chinaman\r\nnamed Sio-Sion-Tay, resident in Binondo, whilst the Government for\r\nseveral years had made contracts with the Chinese for the public\r\nservice. Another Chinaman, christened in the name of Carlos Palanca,\r\nwas later on awarded the Grand Cross of Isabella the Catholic, with\r\nthe title of Excellency.\r\n\r\nMany Chinese have adopted Christianity, either to improve their\r\nsocial standing, or to be enabled thereby to contract marriage with\r\nnatives. Their intercessor and patron is _Saint Nicholas_, since the\r\ntime, it is said, that a Chinaman, having fallen into the Pasig River,\r\nwas in danger of being eaten by an alligator, and saved himself by\r\npraying to that saint, who caused the monster to turn into stone. The\r\nlegendary stone is still to be seen near the left bank of the river.\r\n\r\nThere appears to be no perfectly reliable data respecting the number of\r\nChinese residents in the Archipelago. In 1886 the statistics differed\r\nlargely. One statistician published that there was a total of 66,740\r\nmen and 194 women, of whom 51,348 men and 191 women lived in Manila\r\nand suburbs, 1,154 men and 3 women in Yloilo, and 983 men in Cebu,\r\nthe rest being dispersed over the coast villages and the interior. The\r\nmost competent local authorities in two provinces proved to me that\r\nthe figures relating to their districts were inexact, and all other\r\ninformation on the subject which I have been able to procure tends to\r\nshow that the number of resident Chinese was underrated. I estimate\r\nthat just before the Rebellion of 1896 there were 100,000 Chinese\r\nin the whole Colony, including upwards of 40,000 in and around the\r\ncapital.\r\n\r\nCrowds of Chinese passed to these Islands _via_ Sulu (Jolo), which,\r\nas a free port, they could enter without need of papers. Pretending\r\nto be resident colonists there, they managed to obtain passports to\r\ntravel on business for a limited period in the Philippines, but they\r\nwere never seen again in Sulu.\r\n\r\nIn Spanish times the Chinaman was often referred to as a _Macao_ or\r\na _Sangley_. The former term applied to those who came from Southern\r\nChina (Canton, Macao, Amoy, etc.). They were usually cooks and domestic\r\nservants. The latter signified the Northern Chinaman of the trading\r\nclass. The popular term for a Chinaman in general was a _Suya_.\r\n\r\nIn Manila and in several provincial towns where the Chinese residents\r\nwere numerous, they had their own separate \"Tribunals\" or local\r\ncourts, wherein minor affairs were managed by petty governors of\r\ntheir own nationality, elected bi-annually, in the same manner as\r\nthe natives. In 1888 the question of admitting a Chinese Consulate\r\nin the Philippines was talked of in official circles, which proves\r\nthat the Government was far from seeing the \"Chinese question\" in the\r\nsame light as the Spanish or native merchant class. In the course\r\nof time they acquired a certain consideration in the body politic,\r\nand deputations of Chinese were present in all popular ceremonies\r\nduring the last few years of Spanish rule.\r\n\r\nWherever the Chinese settle they exhibit a disposition to hold their\r\nfooting, if not to strengthen it, at all hazards, by force if need\r\nbe. In Sarawak their Secret Societies threatened to undermine the\r\nprosperity of that little State, and had to be suppressed by capital\r\npunishment. Since the British occupation of Hong-Kong in 1841, there\r\nhave been two serious movements against the Europeans. In 1848 the\r\nChinese murdered Governor Amiral of Macao, and the colonists had to\r\nfight for their lives. In Singapore the attempts of the Chinese to defy\r\nthe Government called for coercive measures, but the danger is small,\r\nbecause the immigrant Chinaman has only the courage to act in mobs.\r\n\r\nIn Australia and the United States it was found necessary to\r\nenact special laws regulating the ingress of Mongols. Under the\r\nSpanish-Philippine Government the most that could be said against\r\nthem, as a class, was that, through their thrift and perseverance,\r\nthey outran the shopkeeping class in the race of life.\r\n\r\nThe Insular Government \"Chinese Exclusion Act,\" at present in\r\noperation, permits those Chinese who are already in the Islands\r\nto remain conditionally, but rigidly debars fresh immigration. The\r\ncorollary is that, in the course of a few years, there will be no\r\nChinese in the Philippines. The working of the above Act is alluded\r\nto in Chapter xxxi.\r\n\r\nUnder a native Government their lot is not likely to be a happy\r\none. One of the aims of the Tagalog Revolutionists was to exclude\r\nthe Chinese entirely from the Islands.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IX\r\n\r\nWild Tribes and Pagans\r\n\r\n\r\nThe population of the Philippines does not consist of one homogeneous\r\nrace; there are Mahometans, Pagans, and Christians, the last being in\r\nthe majority. The one tribe is just as much \"Filipino\" as the other,\r\nand, from the point of view of nationality, they are all equally\r\nfellow-countrymen. [53] So far as tradition serves to elucidate the\r\nproblem of their origin, it would appear that the Filipinos are a\r\nmixed people, descendants of Papuan, Arabian, Hindoo, Malay, Japanese,\r\nChinese, and European forefathers. [54]\r\n\r\nAccording to the last census (1903), the uncivilized population\r\namounted to 8 1/2 per cent. of the whole.\r\n\r\nThe chief of these tribes are the _Aetas_, or _Negritos_, the\r\n_Gaddanes_, _Itavis, Igorrotes, Igorrote-Chinese, Tinguianes,\r\nTagbunuas, Batacs, Manobos_, etc. Also among the southern races of\r\nMindanao Island, referred to in Chapters x. and xxix., there are\r\nseveral pagan tribes interspersed between the Mahometan clans.\r\n\r\nI have used only the generic denominations, for whilst these tribes\r\nare sub-divided (for instance, the _Buquils_ of Zambales, a section\r\nof the _Negritos_; the _Guinaanes_, a sanguinary people inhabiting\r\nthe mountains of the Igorrote district, etc.), the fractions denote\r\nno material physical or moral difference, and the local names adopted\r\nby the different clans of the same race are of no interest to the\r\ngeneral reader. The expression _Bukidnon_, so commonly heard, does\r\nnot signify any particular caste, but, in a general sense, the people\r\nof the mountain (_bukid_).\r\n\r\n_Aetas_, or _Negritos_, numbering 22,000 to 24,000, inhabit\r\nthe mountain regions of Luzon, Panay, Negros, and some smaller\r\nislands. They are dark, some of them being as black as African\r\nnegroes. Their general appearance resembles that of the Alfoor Papuan\r\nof New Guinea. They have curly matted hair, like Astrakhan fur. The\r\nmen cover only their loins, and the women dress from the waist\r\nto the knees. They are a spiritless and cowardly race. They would\r\nnot deliberately face white men in anything like equal numbers with\r\nwarlike intentions, although they would perhaps spend a quiverful of\r\narrows from behind a tree at a retreating foe.\r\n\r\nThe _Aeta_ carries a bamboo lance, a palm-wood bow, and poisoned\r\narrows when out on an expedition. He is wonderfully light-footed,\r\nand runs with great speed after the deer, or climbs a tree like\r\na monkey. Groups of fifty to sixty souls live in community. Their\r\nreligion seems to be a kind of cosmolatry and spirit-worship. Anything\r\nwhich for the time being, in their imagination, has a supernatural\r\nappearance is deified. They have a profound respect for old age and\r\nfor their dead. They are of extremely low intellect, and, although\r\nsome of them have been brought up by civilized families living\r\nin the vicinity of the _Negrito_ mountainous country, they offer\r\nlittle encouragement to those who would desire to train them. Even\r\nwhen more or less domesticated, the _Negrito_ cannot be trusted to\r\ndo anything which requires an effort of judgement. At times his mind\r\nseems to wander from all social order, and an apparently overwhelming\r\neagerness to return to his native haunts disconcerts all one's plans\r\nfor his civilization.\r\n\r\nFor a long time they were the sole masters of Luzon Island, where\r\nthey exercised seignorial rights over the Malay immigrants, until\r\nthese arrived in such numbers, that the _Negritos_ were forced to\r\nretire to the highlands. The taxes imposed upon primitive Malay\r\nsettlers by the _Negritos_ were levied in kind, and when payment was\r\nrefused, they swooped down in a posse, and carried off the head of\r\nthe defaulter. Since the arrival of the Spaniards, the terror of the\r\nwhite man has made them take definitely to the mountains, where they\r\nappear to be very gradually decreasing.\r\n\r\nThe Spanish Government, in vain, made strenuous efforts to implant\r\ncivilized habits among this weak-brained race.\r\n\r\nIn 1881 I visited the Capas Missions in Upper Pampanga. The\r\nauthorities had established there what is called a _real_,--a kind\r\nof model village of bamboo and palm-leaf huts,--to each of which a\r\nfamily was assigned. They were supplied with food, clothing and all\r\nnecessaries of life for one year, which would give them an opportunity\r\nof tilling the land and providing for themselves in future. But they\r\nfollowed their old habits when the year had expired and the subsidy\r\nceased. On my second visit they had returned to their mountain homes,\r\nand I could see no possible inducement for them to do otherwise. The\r\nonly attraction for them during the year was the fostering of their\r\ninbred indolence; and it ought to have been evident that as soon as\r\nthey had to depend on their own resources they would adopt their\r\nown way of living--free of taxes, military service, and social\r\nrestraint--as being more congenial to their tastes.\r\n\r\nBeing in the Bataan Province some years ago, I rode across the\r\nmountain range to the opposite coast with a military friend. On our\r\nway we approached a Negrito _real_, and hearing strange noises and\r\nextraordinary calls, we stopped to consult as to the prudence of riding\r\nup to the settlement. We decided to go there, and were fortunate enough\r\nto be present at a wedding. The young bride, who might have been about\r\nthirteen years of age, was being pursued by her future spouse as she\r\npretended to run away, and it need hardly be said that he succeeded in\r\nbringing her in by feigned force. She struggled, and again got away,\r\nand a second time she was caught. Then an old man with grey hair came\r\nforward and dragged the young man up a bamboo ladder. An old woman\r\ngrasped the bride, and both followed the bridegroom. The aged sire\r\nthen gave them a douche with a cocoa-nut shell full of water, and\r\nthey all descended. The happy pair knelt down, and the elder having\r\nplaced their heads together, they were man and wife. We endeavoured\r\nto find out which hut was allotted to the newly-married couple,\r\nbut we were given to understand that until the sun had reappeared\r\nfive times they would spend their honeymoon in the mountains. After\r\nthe ceremony was concluded, several present began to make their usual\r\nmountain-call. In the lowlands, the same peculiar cry serves to bring\r\nhome straggling domestic animals to their nocturnal resting-place.\r\n\r\nThere is something picturesque about a well-formed, healthy Negrita\r\ndamsel, with jet-black piercing eyes, and her hair in one perfect\r\nball of close curls. The men are not of a handsome type; some of them\r\nhave a hale, swarthy appearance, but many of them present a sickly,\r\nemaciated aspect. A Negrita matron past thirty is perhaps one of the\r\nleast attractive objects in humanity.\r\n\r\nThey live principally on fish, roots, and mountain rice, but they\r\noccasionally make a raid on the neighbouring valleys and carry off\r\nthe herds. So great was their cattle-stealing propensity in Spanish\r\ntimes, that several semi-official expeditions were sent to punish\r\nthe marauders, particularly on the Cordillera de Zambales, on the\r\nwest side of Luzon Island.\r\n\r\nThe husbandry of the Negritos is the most primitive imaginable. It\r\nconsists of scraping the surface of the earth--without clearance of\r\nforest--and throwing the seed. They never \"take up\" a piece of land,\r\nbut sow in the manner described wherever they may happen temporarily\r\nto settle.\r\n\r\nThe _Gaddanes_ occupy the extreme N.W. corner of Luzon Island, and\r\nare entirely out of the pale of civilization. I have never heard that\r\nany attempt has been made to subdue them. They have a fine physical\r\nbearing; wear the hair down to the shoulders; are of a very dark\r\ncolour, and feed chiefly on roots, mountain rice, game, fruits, and\r\nfish. They are considered the only really warlike and aggressively\r\nsavage tribe of the north, and it is the custom of the young men about\r\nto marry to vie with each other in presenting to the sires of their\r\nfuture brides all the scalps they are able to take from their enemies,\r\nas proof of their manly courage. This practice prevails at the season\r\nof the year when the tree, commonly called by the Spaniards \"the\r\nfire-tree,\" is in bloom. The flowers of this tree are of a fire-red\r\nhue, and their appearance is the signal for this race to collect their\r\ntrophies of war and celebrate certain religious rites. When I was in\r\nthe extreme north, in the country of the _Ibanacs_, [55] preparing\r\nmy expedition to the _Gaddanes_ tribe, I was cautioned not to remain\r\nin the Gaddanes country until the fire-tree blossomed. The arms used\r\nby the _Gaddanes_ are frightful weapons--long lances with tridented\r\ntips, and arrows pointed with two rows of teeth, made out of flint\r\nor sea-shells. These weapons are used to kill both fish and foe.\r\n\r\nThe _Itavis_ inhabit the district to the south of that territory\r\noccupied by the _Gaddanes_, and their mode of living and food are\r\nvery similar. They are, however, not so fierce as the _Gaddanes_,\r\nand if assaults are occasionally made on other tribes, it may\r\nbe rather attributed to a desire to retaliate than to a love of\r\nbloodshed. Their skin is not so dark as that of their northern\r\nneighbours--the _Gaddanes_ or the partially civilized _Ibanacs_--and\r\ntheir hair is shorter.\r\n\r\nThe _Igorrotes_ are spread over a considerable portion of Luzon,\r\nprincipally from N. lat. 16 deg. 30' to 18 deg.. They are, in general, a fine\r\nrace of people, physically considered, but semi-barbarous and living\r\nin squalor. They wear their hair long. At the back it hangs down to\r\nthe shoulders, whilst in front it is cut shorter and allowed to cover\r\nthe forehead half-way like a long fringe. Some of them, settled in the\r\ndistricts of Lepanto and El Abra, have a little hair on the chin and\r\nupper lip. Their skin is of a dark copper tinge. They have flat noses,\r\nthick lips, high cheek-bones, and their broad shoulders and limbs\r\nseem to denote great strength, but their form is not at all graceful.\r\n\r\nLike all the wild races of the Philippines, the _Igorrotes_ are\r\nindolent to the greatest degree. Their huts are built bee-hive fashion,\r\nand they creep into them like quadrupeds. Fields of sweet potatoes\r\nand sugar-cane are under cultivation by them. They cannot be forced or\r\npersuaded to embrace the Western system of civilization. Adultery is\r\nlittle known, but if it occurs, the dowry is returned and the divorce\r\nsettled. Polygamy seems to be permitted, but little practised. Murders\r\nare common, and if a member of one hut or family group is killed,\r\nthat family avenges itself on one of the murderer's kinsmen, hence\r\nthose who might have to \"pay the piper\" are interested in maintaining\r\norder. In the Province of La Isabela, the Negrito and Igorrote tribes\r\nkeep a regular _Dr._ and _Cr._ account of heads. In 1896 there were\r\nabout 100,000 head-hunting _Igorrotes_ in the Benguet district. This\r\ntribe paid to the Spaniards a recognition of vassalage of one-quarter\r\nof a peso _per capita_ in Benguet, Abra, Bontoc, and Lepanto.\r\n\r\nTheir aggressions on the coast settlers have been frequent for\r\ncenturies past. From time to time they came down from their mountain\r\nretreat to steal cattle and effects belonging to the domesticated\r\npopulation. The first regular attempt to chastise them for these\r\ninroads, and afterwards gain their submission, was in the time of\r\nGovernor Pedro de Arandia (1754-59), when a plan was concerted to\r\nattack them simultaneously from all sides with 1,080 men. Their ranches\r\nand crops were laid waste, and many _Igorrotes_ were taken prisoners,\r\nbut the ultimate idea of securing their allegiance was abandoned as\r\nan impossibility.\r\n\r\nIn 1881 General Primo de Rivera, at the head of a large armed force,\r\ninvaded their district with the view of reducing them to obedience,\r\nbut the apparent result of the expedition was more detrimental than\r\nadvantageous to the project of bringing this tribe under Spanish\r\ndominion and of opening up their country to trade and enlightened\r\nintercourse. Whilst the expeditionary forces were not sufficiently\r\nlarge or in a condition to carry on a war _a outrance_ successfully,\r\nto be immediately followed up by a military system of government, on\r\nthe other hand, the feeble efforts displayed to conquer them served\r\nonly to demonstrate the impotence of the Europeans. This gave the\r\ntribes courage to defend their liberty, whilst the licence indulged\r\nin by the white men at the expense of the mountaineers--and boasted\r\nof to me personally by many Spanish officers--had merely the effect\r\nof raising the veil from their protestations of goodwill towards\r\nthe race they sought to subdue. The enterprise ignominiously failed;\r\nthe costly undertaking was an inglorious and fruitless one, except\r\nto the General, who--being under royal favour since, at Sagunta,\r\nin 1875, he \"pronounced\" for King Alfonso--secured for himself the\r\ntitle of Count of La Union.\r\n\r\nThe _Igorrotes_ have, since then, been less approachable by Europeans,\r\nwhom they naturally regard with every feeling of distrust. Rightly\r\nor wrongly (if it can be a matter of opinion), they fail to see any\r\nmanifestation of ultimate advantage to themselves in the arrival of a\r\ntroop of armed strangers who demand from them food (even though it be\r\non payment) and perturbate their most intimate family ties. They do not\r\nappreciate being \"civilized\" to exchange their usages, independence,\r\nand comfort for even the highest post obtainable by a native in the\r\nprovinces, which then was practically that of local head servant\r\nto the district authority, under the name of Municipal Captain. To\r\nroam at large in their mountain home is far more enjoyable to them\r\nthan having to wear clothes; to present themselves often, if not to\r\nhabitually reside, in villages; to pay taxes, for which they would\r\nget little return--not even the boon of good highroads--and to act\r\nas unsalaried tax-collectors with the chance of fine, punishment, and\r\nruin if they did not succeed in bringing funds to the Public Treasury.\r\n\r\nAs to Christianity, it would be as hard a task to convince them of what\r\nRoman Catholicism deems indispensable for the salvation of the soul, as\r\nit would be to convert all England to the teachings of Buddha--although\r\nBuddhism is as logical a religion as Christianity. Just a few of\r\nthem, inhabiting the lowlands in the neighbourhood of Vigan and other\r\nchristian towns, received baptism and paid an annual tribute of half\r\na peso from the year 1893 to 1896.\r\n\r\nBeing in Tuguegarao, the capital of Cagayan Province, about 60\r\nmiles up the Rio Grande, I went to visit the prisons, where I saw\r\nmany of the worst types of _Igorrotes_. I was told that a priest\r\nwho had endeavoured to teach them the precepts of Christianity,\r\nand had explained to them the marvellous life of Saint Augustine,\r\nwas dismayed to hear an _Igorrote_ exclaim that no coloured man\r\never became a white man's saint. Nothing could convince him that\r\nan exception to the rule might be possible. Could experience have\r\nrevealed to him the established fact--the remarkable anomaly--that\r\nthe grossest forms of immorality were only to be found in the trail\r\nof the highest order of white man's civilization?\r\n\r\nThe _Igorrotes_ have worked the copper mines of their region for\r\ngenerations past, in their own primitive way, with astonishing\r\nresults. They not only annually barter several tons of copper\r\ningots, but they possess the art of manufacturing pots, cauldrons,\r\ntobacco-pipes, and other utensils made of that metal. They also\r\nunderstand the extraction of gold, which they obtain in very small\r\nquantities by crushing the quartz between heavy stones.\r\n\r\nSpecimens of the different tribes and races of these Islands were on\r\nview at the Philippine Exhibition held in Madrid in 1887. Some of\r\nthem consented to receive Christian baptism before returning home,\r\nbut it was publicly stated that the _Igorrotes_ were among those who\r\npositively refused to abandon their own belief.\r\n\r\nA selection of this tribe was included in the Filipinos on show at\r\nthe San Louis Exhibition (U.S.A.) in 1904, and attracted particular\r\nattention. Some of them liked the United States so much that they\r\ntried hard to break away from their keepers in order to remain there.\r\n\r\nThe _Calingas_ are a branch of the _Igorrotes_, found along the Cagayan\r\nRiver around Ilagan. They are not only head-hunters, but cannibals. A\r\nfriend of mine, an American colonel, was up there some time during\r\nthe war, and explained to me the difficulty he had in convincing a\r\nCalinga chief that a man's head is his personal property, and that\r\nto steal it is a crime.\r\n\r\nThe _Igorrote-Chinese_ are supposed to be the descendants of the\r\nChinese who fled to the hills on the departure of the corsair\r\nLi-ma-hong from Pangasinan Province in 1754 (_vide_ p. 50). Their\r\nintermarriage with the _Igorrote_ tribe has generated a caste of\r\npeople quite unique in their character. Their habits are much the\r\nsame as those of the pure _Igorrotes_, but with their fierce nature is\r\nblended the cunning and astuteness of the Mongol; and although their\r\nintelligence may be often misapplied, yet it is superior to that of\r\nthe pure _Igorrote_. In the Province of Pangasinan there are numbers\r\nof natives of Chinese descent included in the domesticated population,\r\nand their origin is evidently due to the circumstances mentioned.\r\n\r\nThe _Tingulanes_ inhabit principally the district of El Abra\r\n(N.W. coast, Luzon Is.). They were nominally under the control\r\nof the Spanish Government, who appointed their headmen petty\r\ngovernors of villages or ranches on the system adopted in the subdued\r\ndistricts. According to Father Ferrando (63 years ago), the form of\r\noath taken in his presence by the newly-elected headman on receiving\r\nthe staff of office was the following, viz.:--\"May a pernicious wind\r\ntouch me; may a flash of lightning kill me, and may the alligator\r\ncatch me asleep if I fail to fulfil my duty.\" The headman presented\r\nhimself almost when he chose to the nearest Spanish Governor, who gave\r\nhim his orders, which were only fulfilled according to the traditional\r\ncustom of the tribe. Thus, the headman, on his return to the ranche,\r\ndelegated his powers to the council of elders, and according to their\r\ndecision he acted as the executive only. Whenever it was possible,\r\nthey applied their own _lex non scripta_ in preference to acting upon\r\nthe Spanish Code.\r\n\r\nAccording to their law, the crime of adultery is punished by a fine\r\nof 30 pesos value and divorce, but if the adultery has been mutual,\r\nthe divorce is pronounced absolute, without the payment of a fine.\r\n\r\nWhen a man is brought to justice on an accusation which he denies,\r\na handful of straw is burnt in his presence. He is made to hold up an\r\nearthenware pot and say as follows:--\"May my belly be converted into\r\na pot like this, if I have committed the deed attributed to me.\" If\r\nthe transformation does not take place at once, he is declared to\r\nbe innocent.\r\n\r\nThe _Tinguianes_ are pagans, but have no temples. Their gods are\r\nhidden in the mountain cavities. Like many other religionists, they\r\nbelieve in the efficacy of prayer for the supply of their material\r\nwants. Hence if there be too great an abundance of rain, or too little\r\nof it, or an epidemic disease raging, or any calamity affecting the\r\ncommunity in general, the _Anitos_ (images representing the gods or\r\nsaints) are carried round and exhorted, whilst Nature continues her\r\nuninterrupted course. The minister of _Anito_ is also appealed to\r\nwhen a child is to be named. The infant is carried into the woods, and\r\nthe pagan priest pronounces the name, whilst he raises a bowie-knife\r\nover the newborn creature's head. On lowering the knife, he strikes\r\nat a tree. If the tree emits sap, the first name uttered stands good;\r\nif not, the ceremony is repeated, and each time the name is changed\r\nuntil the oozing sap denotes the will of the deity.\r\n\r\nThe _Tinguianes_ are monogamists, and generally are forced by the\r\nparents to marry before the age of puberty, but the bridegroom, or\r\nhis father or elder, has to purchase the bride at a price mutually\r\nagreed upon by the relations. These people live in cabins on posts\r\nor trees 60 to 70 feet from the ground, and defend themselves from\r\nthe attacks of their traditional enemies, the _Guinaanes_, by heaving\r\nstones upon them. Nevertheless, in the more secure vicinities of the\r\nchristian villages, these people build their huts similar to those of\r\nthe domesticated natives. From the doors and window-openings skulls\r\nof buffaloes and horses are hung as talismans.\r\n\r\nPhysically they are of fine form, and the nose is aquiline. They wear\r\nthe hair in a tuft on the crown, like the Japanese, but their features\r\nare similar to the ordinary lowland native. They are fond of music and\r\npersonal ornaments. They tattoo themselves and black their teeth; and\r\nfor these, and many other reasons, it is conjectured that they descend\r\nfrom the Japanese shipwrecked crews who, being without means at hand\r\nwith which to return to their country, took to the mountains inland\r\nfrom the west coast of Luzon. I spent several months with this tribe,\r\nbut I have never seen a _Tinguian_ with a bow and arrow; they carry\r\nthe lance as the common weapon, and for hunting and spearing fish.\r\n\r\nTheir conversion to Christianity has proved to be an impossible\r\ntask. A Royal Decree of Ferdinand VI.. dated in Aranjuez, June 18,\r\n1758, sets forth that the infidels called _Tinguianes, Igorrotes_,\r\nand by other names who should accept Christian baptism, should\r\nbe exempt all their lives from the payment of tribute and forced\r\nlabour. Their offspring, however, born to them after receiving baptism,\r\nwould lose these privileges as well as the independence enjoyed by\r\ntheir forefathers. This penalty to future generations for becoming\r\nChristians was afterwards extended to all the undomesticated races.\r\n\r\nMany of these tribes did a little barter traffic with the Chinese,\r\nbut--with the hope that necessity would bring them down to\r\nthe christian villages to procure commodities, and thus become\r\nsocialized--the Government prohibited this trade in 1886.\r\n\r\nThe _Tinguianes_ appear to be as intelligent as the ordinary subdued\r\nnatives. They are by no means savages, and they are not entirely\r\nstrangers to domestic life. A great many Christian families of El Abra\r\nand Ilocos Sur are of _Tinguian_ origin, and I may mention here that\r\nthe Ilocano dominated natives have the just reputation of being the\r\nmost industrious Philippine people. For this reason, Ilocano servants\r\nand workmen are sought for in preference to most others.\r\n\r\nThe _Basanes_ are a very timid people who inhabit the mountains of\r\nMindoro Island. They have long, lank hair and whitish faces, and do\r\nnot appear to be of one of the original races. They are occasionally\r\nmet with (when they do not hide themselves) in the cordillera which\r\nruns north-west to south-east and then ends off in two spurs, between\r\nwhich, after passing Mount Halcon, there is a large valley leading\r\nto the southern shore. The _Manguianes_, another Mindoro wild tribe,\r\ncome to the coast villages sometimes to barter, and bring pieces of\r\ngold for the purpose. They also wear gold jewellery made of the metal\r\nextracted by themselves.\r\n\r\nThere is another race of people whose source is not distinctly\r\nknown, but, according to tradition, they descend from the Sepoys who\r\nformed part of the troops under British command during the military\r\noccupation of Manila in 1763 (_vide_ p. 88). The legend is, that these\r\n_Hindoos_, having deserted from the British army, migrated up the\r\nPasig River. However that may be, the sharp-featured, black-skinned\r\nsettlers in the Barrio de Dayap, of Cainta Town (Morong district),\r\nare decidedly of a different stock to the ordinary native. The notable\r\nphysical differences are the fine aquiline nose, bright expression,\r\nand regular features. They are Christians--far more laborious than the\r\nPhilippine natives, and are a law-abiding people. I have known many of\r\nthem personally for years. They were the only class who voluntarily\r\npresented themselves to pay the taxes to the Spaniards, and yet,\r\non the ground that generations ago they were intruders on the soil,\r\nthey were more heavily laden with imposts than their fellow-neighbours\r\nuntil the abolition of tribute in 1884.\r\n\r\nThere are also to be seen in these Islands a few types of that class\r\nof tropical inhabitant, preternaturally possessed of a white skin\r\nand extremely fair hair--sometimes red--known as _Albinos_. I leave\r\nit to physiologists to elucidate the peculiarity of vital phenomena\r\nin these unfortunate abnormities of Nature. Amongst others, I once\r\nsaw in Negros Island a hapless young Albino girl, with marble-white\r\nskin and very light pink-white hair, who was totally blind in the\r\nsunny hours of the day.\r\n\r\nThe _Mahometan_ and other tribes, inhabiting the Sulu Sultanate,\r\nMindanao, Palauan (Paragua) and the adjacent islands of the South\r\nconstituting \"Moroland,\" are described in Chapters x. and xxix.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER X\r\n\r\nMahometans and Southern Tribes\r\n\r\n\r\nSimultaneously with the Spanish conquest of the Philippines, two\r\nBorneo chiefs, who were brothers, quarrelled about their respective\r\npossessions, and one of them had to flee. His partisans joined him,\r\nand they emigrated to the Island of Basilan, [56] situated to the\r\nsouth of Zamboanga (Mindanao Is.). The _Moros_, as they are called in\r\nthe Islands, are therefore supposed to be descended from the Mahometan\r\nDyaks of Borneo. They were a valiant, warlike, piratical people, who\r\nadmired bravery in others--had a deep-rooted contempt for poltroons,\r\nand lavished no mercy on the weak.\r\n\r\nIn the suite of this emigrant chief, called Paguian Tindig, catoe his\r\ncousin Adasaolan, who was so captivated by the fertility of Basilan\r\nIsland that he wished to remain there; so Tindig left him in possession\r\nand withdrew to Sulu Island, where he easily reduced the natives\r\nto vassalage, for they had never yet had to encounter so powerful\r\na foe. So famous did Paguian Tindig become that, for generations\r\nafterwards, the Sultans of Sulu were proud of their descent from such\r\na celebrated hero. After the Spaniards had pacified the great Butuan\r\nchief on the north coast of Mindanao, Tindig consented to acknowledge\r\nthe suzerainty of their king, in exchange for undisturbed possession\r\nof the realm which he had just founded.\r\n\r\nAdasaolan espoused the Princess Paguian Goan, daughter of Dimasangcay,\r\nKing of Mindanao, by his wife Imbog, a Sulu woman, and with this\r\nrelationship he embraced the Mahometan faith. His ambition increased\r\nas good fortune came to him, and, stimulated by the promised support\r\nof his father-in-law, he invaded Sulu, attacked his cousin Tindig,\r\nand attempted to murder him in order to annex his kingdom. A short\r\nbut fierce contest ensued. Tindig's fortified dwelling was besieged\r\nin vain. The posts which supported the upper storey were greased\r\nwith oil, and an entrance could not be effected. Wearied of his\r\nfailures, Adasaolan retired from the enterprise, and Tindig, in\r\nturn, declared war on the Basilan king after he had been to Manila\r\nto solicit assistance from his Spanish suzerain's representative,\r\nwho sent two armed boats to support him.\r\n\r\nWhen Tindig, on his return from Manila, arrived within sight of Sulu,\r\nhis anxious subjects rallied round him, and prepared for battle. The\r\ntwo armed boats furnished by the Spaniards were on the way, but, as\r\nyet, too far off to render help, so Adasaolan immediately fell upon\r\nTindig's party and completely routed them. Tindig himself died bravely,\r\nfighting to the last moment, and the Spaniards, having no one to\r\nfight for when they arrived, returned to Manila with their armed boats.\r\n\r\nAdasaolan, however, did not annex the territory of his defeated\r\ncousin. Rajah Bongso succeeded Tindig in the Government of Sulu,\r\nand when old age enfeebled him, he was wont to show with pride the\r\nscars inflicted on him during the war of independence.\r\n\r\nAdasaolan then made alliances with Mindanao and Borneo people,\r\nand introduced the Mahometan religion into Sulu. Since then, Sulu\r\n(called \"Jolo,\" by the Spaniards) has become the Mecca of the Southern\r\nArchipelago. [57]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe earliest records relating to Mindanao Island, since the Spanish\r\nannexation of the Philippines, show that about the year 1594 a\r\nrich Portuguese cavalier of noble birth, named Estevan Rodriguez,\r\nwho had acquired a large fortune in the Philippines, and who had a\r\nwealthy brother in Mexico, proposed to the Governor Perez Dasmarinas\r\nthe conquest of this island. For this purpose he offered his person\r\nand all his means, but having long waited in vain to obtain the\r\nroyal sanction to his project, he prepared to leave for Mexico,\r\ndisgusted and disappointed. He was on the point of starting for\r\nNew Spain; he had his ship laden and his family on board, when the\r\nroyal confirmation arrived with the new Governor, Dr. Antonio Morga\r\n(1595-96). Therefore he changed his plans, but despatched the laden\r\nship to Mexico with the cargo, intending to employ the profits of\r\nthe venture in the prosecution of his Mindanao enterprise. With the\r\ntitle of General, he and his family, together with three chaplain\r\npriests, started in another vessel for the south. They put in at\r\nOtong (Panay Is.) on the way, and left there in April, 1596. Having\r\nreached the great Mindanao River (Rio Grande), the ship went up it\r\nas far as Buhayen, in the territory of the chief Silongan. A party\r\nunder Juan de la Jara, the _Maestre de Campo_, was sent ashore to\r\nreconnoitre the environs. Their delay in returning caused alarm, so the\r\nGeneral buckled on his shield, and, with sword in hand, disembarked,\r\naccompanied by a Cebuano servant and two Spaniards, carrying lances. On\r\nthe way they met a native, who raised his _campilan_ to deal a blow,\r\nwhich the General received on his shield, and cut down the foe to\r\nthe waist. Then they encountered another, who clove the General's\r\nhead almost in two, causing his death in six hours. The Cebuano at\r\nonce ran the native through with a lance. This brave was discovered\r\nto be the youngest brother of the chief Silongan, who had sworn to\r\nMahomet to sacrifice his life to take that of the Castilian invader.\r\n\r\nThe General's corpse was sent to Manila for interment. The expedition\r\nled by the _Maestre de Campo_ fared badly, one of the party being\r\nkilled, another seriously wounded, and the rest fleeing on board. The\r\nnext day it was decided to construct trenches at the mouth of the\r\nriver, where the camp was established. The command was taken by the\r\n_Maestre de Campo_, whose chief exploit seems to have been that he\r\nmade love to the deceased General's widow and proposed marriage to her,\r\nwhich she indignantly rejected. Nothing was gained by the expedition,\r\nand after the last priest died, the project was abandoned and the\r\nvessel returned to Cebu.\r\n\r\nIn 1638 another expedition against the Moros was headed by the\r\nGov.-General Sebastian Hurtado de Corcuera, who made the first landing\r\nof troops in Sulu Island on April 17 of that year. He also established\r\nsome military posts on the coast of Mindanao Island, one of which\r\nwas Sampanilla (now called Malabang) on the Illana Bay shore. Four\r\nyears afterwards it was abandoned until 1891, when General Weyler\r\nwent there and had a fort built, which still exists.\r\n\r\nIt would appear that all over these Islands the strong preyed on\r\nthe weak, and the boldest warrior or oppressor assumed the title\r\nof Sultan, _Datto_, etc., over all the territory he could dominate,\r\nmaking the dignity hereditary. So far as can be ascertained, one of\r\nthe oldest titles was that of Prince of Sibuguey, whose territory\r\nwas situated on the bay of that name which washes the N.E. coast of\r\nZamboanga Province. The title fell into disuse, and the grandson of\r\nthe last prince, the present _Manguiguin_, or Sultan of Mindanao,\r\nresides at Dinas. The sultanate dates from the year 1640, but, in\r\nreality, there never was a sultan with effective jurisdiction over\r\nthe whole island, as the title would seem to imply. The Sultan's heir\r\nis styled the _Rajahmudah_.\r\n\r\nThe alliances effected between the Sulu and Mindanao potentates gave\r\na great stimulus to piracy, which hitherto had been confined to the\r\nwaters in the locality of those islands. It now spread over the whole\r\nof the Philippine Archipelago, and was prosecuted with great vigour\r\nby regular organized fleets, carrying weapons almost equal to those\r\nof the Spaniards. In meddling with the Mahometan territories the\r\nSpaniards may be said to have unconsciously lighted on a hornets'\r\nnest. Their eagerness for conquest stirred up the implacable hatred\r\nof the Mahometan for the Christian, and they unwittingly brought\r\nwoe upon their own heads for many generations. Indeed, if half the\r\nconsequences could have been foreseen, they surely never would have\r\nattempted to gain what, up to their last day, they failed to secure,\r\nnamely, the complete conquest of Mindanao and the Sulu Sultanate.\r\n\r\nFor over two and a half centuries Mahometan war-junks ravaged every\r\ncoast of the Colony. Not a single peopled island was spared. Thousands\r\nof the inhabitants were murdered, whilst others were carried into\r\nslavery for years. Villages were sacked; the churches were looted;\r\nlocal trade was intercepted; the natives subject to Spain were driven\r\ninto the highlands, and many even dared not risk their lives and goods\r\nnear the coasts. The utmost desolation and havoc were perpetrated,\r\nand militated vastly against the welfare and development of the\r\nColony. For four years the Government had to remit the payment of\r\ntribute in Negros Island, and the others lying between it and Luzon, on\r\naccount of the abject poverty of the natives, due to these raids. From\r\nthe time the Spaniards first interfered with the Mahometans there was\r\ncontinual warfare. Expeditions against the pirates were constantly\r\nbeing fitted out by each succeeding Governor. Piracy was indeed an\r\nincessant scourge and plague on the Colony, and it cost the Spaniards\r\nrivers of blood and millions of dollars only to keep it in check.\r\n\r\nIn the last century the Mahometans appeared even in the Bay of\r\nManila. I was acquainted with several persons who had been in\r\nMahometan captivity. There were then hundreds who still remembered,\r\nwith anguish, the insecurity to which their lives and properties were\r\nexposed. The Spaniards were quite unable to cope with such a prodigious\r\ncalamity. The coast villagers built forts for their own defence, and\r\nmany an old stone watch-tower is still to be seen on the islands south\r\nof Luzon. On several occasions the Christian natives were urged, by\r\nthe inducement of spoil, to equip corsairs, with which to retaliate on\r\nthe indomitable marauders. The Sulu people made captive the Christian\r\nnatives and Spaniards alike, whilst a Spanish priest was a choice\r\nprize. And whilst Spaniards in Philippine waters were straining every\r\nnerve to extirpate slavery, their countrymen were diligently pursuing\r\na profitable trade in it between the West Coast of Africa and Cuba!\r\n\r\nOne must admit that, indirectly, the Mahometan attacks had the good\r\npolitical effect of forcing hundreds of Christians up from the coast\r\nto people and cultivate the interior of these Islands.\r\n\r\nDue to the enterprise of a few Spanish and foreign merchants,\r\nsteamers at length began to navigate the waters of the Archipelago,\r\nprovided with arms for defence, and piracy by Mahometans beyond\r\ntheir own locality was doomed. In the time of Gov.-General Norzagaray\r\n(1857-60), 18 steam gunboats were ordered out, and arrived in 1860,\r\nputting a close for ever to this epoch of misery, bloodshed, and\r\nmaterial loss. The end of piracy brought repose to the Colony, and\r\nin no small degree facilitated its social advancement.\r\n\r\nDuring the protracted struggle with the Mahometans, Zamboanga\r\n(Mindanao Is.) was fortified, and became the headquarters of the\r\nSpaniards in the south. After Cavite it was the chief naval station,\r\nand a penitentiary was also established there. [58] Its maintenance\r\nwas a great burden to the Treasury--its existence a great eyesore\r\nto the enemy, whose hostility was much inflamed thereby. About\r\nthe year 1635 its abandonment was proposed by the military party,\r\nwho described it as only a sepulchre for Spaniards. The Jesuits,\r\nhowever, urged its continuance, as it suited their interests to have\r\nmaterial support close at hand, and their influence prevailed in\r\nManila bureaucratic centres.\r\n\r\nIn 1738 the fixed annual expenses of Zamboanga fort and equipment were\r\n17,500 pesos, and the incidental disbursements were estimated at 7,500\r\npesos. These sums did not include the cost of scores of armed fleets\r\nwhich, at enormous expense, were sent out against the Mahometans to\r\nlittle purpose. Each new (Zamboanga) Governor of a martial spirit,\r\nand desiring to do something to establish or confirm his fame for\r\nprowess, seemed to regard it as a kind of duty to premise the quelling\r\nof imaginary troubles in Sulu and Mindanao. Some, with less patriotism\r\nthan selfishness, found a ready excuse for filling their own pockets\r\nby the proceeds of warfare, in making feigned efforts to rescue\r\ncaptives. It may be observed, in extenuation, that, in those days,\r\nthe Spaniards believed from their birth that none but a Christian\r\nhad rights, whilst some were deluded by a conscientious impression\r\nthat they were executing a high mission; myth as it was, it at least\r\nserved to give them courage in their perilous undertakings. Peace\r\nwas made and broken over and over again. Spanish forts were at times\r\nestablished in Sulu, and afterwards demolished. Every decade brought\r\nnew devices to control the desperate foe. Several Governors-General\r\nheaded the troops in person against the Mahometans with temporary\r\nsuccess, but without any lasting effect, and almost every new Governor\r\nmade a solemn treaty with one powerful chief or another, which was\r\nrespected only as long as it suited both parties. This continued\r\ncampaign, the details of which are too prolix for insertion here,\r\nmay be qualified as a religious war, for Roman Catholic priests took\r\nan active part in the operations with the same ardent passion as the\r\nMahometans themselves. Among these tonsured warriors who acquired\r\ngreat fame _out_ of their profession may be mentioned Father Ducos,\r\nthe son of a Colonel, Jose Villanueva, and Pedro de San Agustin, the\r\nlast being known, with dread, by the Mahometans in the beginning of\r\nthe 17th century under the title of the Captain-priest. One of the most\r\nrenowned kings in Mindanao was Cachil Corralat, an astute, far-seeing\r\nchieftain, who ably defended the independence of his territory,\r\nand kept the Spaniards at bay during the whole of his manhood.\r\n\r\nAn interesting event in the Spanish-Sulu history is the visit of the\r\nSultan Mahamad Alimudin to the Gov.-General in 1750, and his subsequent\r\nvicissitudes of fortune. The first royal despatch addressed by the\r\nKing of Spain to the Sultan of Sulu was dated in Buen Retiro, July 12,\r\n1744, and everything, for the time being, seemed to augur a period\r\nof peace. In 1749, however, the Sultan was violently deposed by an\r\nambitious brother, Prince Bantilan, and the Sultan forthwith went to\r\nManila to seek the aid of his suzerain's delegate, the Gov.-General of\r\nthe Philippines, who chanced to be the Bishop of Nueva Segovia. In\r\nManila the Priest-Governor cajoled his guest with presents, and\r\naccompanied him on horseback and on foot, with the design of persuading\r\nhim to renounce his religion in favour of Christianity. The Sultan\r\nfinally yielded, and avowed his intention to receive baptism. Among the\r\nfriars an animated discussion ensued as to the propriety of this act,\r\nspecial opposition being raised by the Jesuits; but in the end the\r\nSultan, with a number of his suite, outwardly embraced the Christian\r\nfaith. The Sultan at his baptism received the name of Ferdinand I. of\r\nSulu; at the same time he was invested with the insignia and grade\r\nof a Spanish Lieut.-General. Great ceremonies and magnificent feasts\r\nfollowed this unprecedented incident. He was visited and congratulated\r\nby all the _elite_ of the capital. By proclamation, the festivities\r\nincluded four days' illumination, three days' procession of the\r\ngiants, [59] three days of bull-fighting, four nights of fireworks,\r\nand three nights of comedy, to terminate with High Mass, a _Te Deum_,\r\nand special sermon for the occasion.\r\n\r\nIn the meantime, the Sultan had requested the Governor to have the\r\nCrown Prince, Princesses, and retainers escorted to Manila to learn\r\nSpanish manners and customs, and on their arrival the Sultan and\r\nhis male and female suite numbered 60 persons. The Bishop-Governor\r\ndefrayed the cost of their maintenance out of his private purse\r\nuntil after the baptism, and thenceforth the Government supported\r\nthem in Manila for two years. At length it was resolved, according to\r\nappearances, to restore the Sultan Ferdinand I. to his throne. With\r\nthat idea, he and his retinue quitted Manila in the Spanish frigate\r\n_San Fernando_, which was convoyed by another frigate and a galley,\r\nuntil the _San Fernando_ fell in with bad weather off Mindoro Island,\r\nand had to make the Port of Calapan. Thence he proceeded to Yloilo,\r\nwhere he changed vessel and set sail for Zamboanga, but contrary winds\r\ncarried him to Dapitan (N.W. coast of Mindanao Is.), where he landed\r\nand put off again in a small Visayan craft for Zamboanga, arriving\r\nthere on July 12, 1751. Thirteen days afterwards the _San Fernando_,\r\nwhich had been repaired, reached Zamboanga also.\r\n\r\nBefore Ferdinand I. left Manila he had (at the instance of the Spanish\r\nGov.-General, Jose de Obando, 1750-54) addressed a letter to Sultan\r\nMuhamad Amirubdin, of Mindanao. The original was written by Ferdinand\r\nI. in Arabic; a version in Spanish was dictated by him, and both were\r\nsigned by him. These documents reached the Governor of Zamboanga by\r\nthe _San Fernando_, but he had the original in Arabic retranslated,\r\nand found that it did not at all agree with the Sultan's Spanish\r\nrendering. The translation of the Arabic runs thus:--\r\n\r\n\"I shall be glad to know that the Sultan Muhamad Amirubdin and all his\r\nchiefs, male and female, are well. I do not write a lengthy letter,\r\nas I intended, because I simply wish to give you to understand, in\r\ncase the Sultan or his chiefs and others should feel aggrieved at my\r\nwriting this letter in this manner, that I do so under pressure, being\r\nunder foreign dominion, and I am compelled to obey whatever they tell\r\nme to do, and I have to say what they tell me to say. Thus the Governor\r\nhas ordered me to write to you in our style and language; therefore,\r\ndo not understand that I am writing you on my own behalf, but because\r\nI am ordered to do so, and I have nothing more to add. Written in\r\nthe year 1164 on the ninth day of the Rabilajer Moon, Ferdinand I.,\r\nKing of Sulu, who seals with his own seal.\"\r\n\r\nThis letter was pronounced treasonable. Impressed with, or feigning,\r\nthis idea, the Spaniards saw real or imaginary indications of a design\r\non the part of the Sultan to throw off the foreign yoke at the first\r\nopportunity. All his acts were thus interpreted, although no positive\r\nproof was manifest, and the Governor communicated his suspicions to\r\nManila. There is no explanation why the Spaniards detained the Sultan\r\nat Zamboanga, unless with the intention of trumping up accusations\r\nagainst him. The Sultan arrived there on July 12, and nothing was known\r\nof the discrepancy between the letters until after July 25. To suppose\r\nthat the Sultan could ever return to reign peacefully as a Christian\r\nover Mahometan subjects was utterly absurd to any rational mind.\r\n\r\nOn August 3 the Sultan, his sons, vassals, and chiefs were all cast\r\ninto prison, without opposition, and a letter was despatched, dated\r\nAugust 6, 1751, to the Governor in Manila, stating the cause. The\r\nSultan was the first individual arrested, and he made no difficulty\r\nabout going to the fort. Even the Prince Asin, the Sultan's brother,\r\nwho had voluntarily come from Sulu in apparent good faith with friendly\r\novertures to the Spaniards, was included among the prisoners. The\r\nreason assigned was, that he had failed to surrender christian captives\r\nas provided.\r\n\r\nThe prisoners, besides the Sultan, were the following, viz.:--\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n    Four sons of the Sultan.\r\n    Prince Asin (brother).\r\n    Prince Mustafa (son-in-law).\r\n    Princess Panguian Banquiling (sister).\r\n    Four Princesses (daughters).\r\n    Datto Yamudin (a noble).\r\n    160 ordinary male and female retainers.\r\n    Five brothers-in-law.\r\n    One Mahometan Cherif.\r\n    Seven Mahometan priests.\r\n    Concubines with 32 female servants.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe political or other crime (if any) attributed to these last is\r\nnot stated, nor why they were imprisoned. The few weapons brought,\r\naccording to custom, by the followers of the Sultan who had come from\r\nSulu to receive their liege-lord and escort him back to his country,\r\nwere also seized.\r\n\r\nA decree of Gov.-General Jose de Obando set forth the following\r\naccusations against the prisoners, viz.:--\r\n\r\n(1) That Prince Asin had not surrendered captives. (2) That whilst\r\nthe Sultan was in Manila, new captives were made by the party who\r\nexpelled him from the throne. (3) That the number of arms brought to\r\nZamboanga by Sulu chiefs was excessive. (4) That the letter to Sultan\r\nMuhamad Amirubdin insinuated help wanted against the Spaniards. (5)\r\nThat several Mahometan, but no christian books were found in the\r\nSultan's baggage. (6) That during the journey to Zamboanga he had\r\nrefused to pray in christian form. (7) That he had only attended Mass\r\ntwice. (8) That he had celebrated Mahometan rites, sacrificing a goat;\r\nand had given evidence in a hundred ways of being a Mahometan. (9)\r\nThat his conversation generally denoted a want of attachment to the\r\nSpaniards, and a contempt for their treatment of him in Manila, [60]\r\nand, (10) that he still cohabited with his concubines, contrary to\r\nchristian usage.\r\n\r\nThe greatest stress was laid on the recovery of the captive Christians,\r\nand the Gov.-General admitted that although the mission of the fleet\r\nwas to restore the Sultan to the throne (which, by the way, does\r\nnot appear to have been attempted), the principal object was the\r\nrescue of christian slaves. He therefore proposed that the liberty\r\nof the imprisoned nobles and chiefs should be bartered at the rate\r\nof 500 christian slaves for each one of the chiefs and nobles,\r\nand the balance of the captives for Prince Asin and the clergy. One\r\nmay surmise, from this condition, that the number of Christians in\r\ncaptivity was very considerable.\r\n\r\nA subsequent decree, dated in Manila December 21, 1751, ordered the\r\nextermination of the Mahometans with fire and sword; the fitting out of\r\nVisayan corsairs, with authority to extinguish the foe, burn all that\r\nwas combustible, destroy the crops, desolate their cultivated land,\r\nmake captives, and recover christian slaves. One-fifth of the spoil\r\n(the _Real quinto_) was to belong to the King, and the natives were\r\nto be exempt from the payment of tribute whilst so engaged.\r\n\r\nBefore giving effect to such a terrible, but impracticable resolution,\r\nit was thought expedient to publish a pamphlet styled a \"Historical\r\nManifest,\" in which the Gov.-General professed to justify his acts\r\nfor public satisfaction. However, public opinion in Manila was averse\r\nto the intended warfare, so to make it more popular, the Governor\r\nabolished the payment of one-fifth of the booty to the King. An\r\nappeal was made to the citizens of Manila for arms and provisions\r\nto carry on the campaign; they therefore lent or gave the following,\r\nviz.:--Twenty-six guns, 13 bayonets, 3 sporting guns, 15 carbines, 5\r\nblunderbusses, 7 braces of pistols, 23 swords, 15 lances, 900 cannon\r\nballs, and 150 pesos from Spaniards, and a few lances and 188 pesos\r\nfrom natives.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, Prince Asin died of grief at his position.\r\n\r\nUnder the leadership of the _Maestre de Campo_ of Zamboanga,\r\nhostilities commenced. With several ships he proceeded to Sulu,\r\ncarrying a large armament and 1,900 men. When the squadron anchored off\r\nSulu, a white and a red flag were hoisted from the principal fort, for\r\nthe Spaniards to elect either peace or war. Several Sulus approached\r\nthe fleet with white flags, to inquire for the Sultan. Evasive answers\r\nwere given, followed by a sudden cannonade.\r\n\r\nNo good resulted to the Spaniards from the attack, for the Sulus\r\ndefended themselves admirably. Tawi Tawi Island was next assaulted. A\r\ncaptain landed there with troops, but their retreat was cut off and\r\nthey were all slain. The Commander of the expedition was so discouraged\r\nthat he returned to Zamboanga and resigned. Pedro Gastambide then\r\ntook command, but after having attacked Basilan Island fruitlessly,\r\nhe retired to Zamboanga. The whole campaign was an entire fiasco. It\r\nwas a great mistake to have declared a war of extermination without\r\nhaving the means to carry it out. The result was that the irate\r\nSulus organized a guerilla warfare, by sea and by land, against all\r\nChristians, to which the Spaniards but feebly responded. The \"tables\r\nwere turned.\" In fact, they were in great straits, and, wearied at\r\nthe little success of their arms, endless councils and discussions\r\nwere held in the capital.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, almost every coast of the Archipelago was energetically\r\nravaged. Hitherto the Spaniards had only had the Sulus to contend\r\nwith, but the licence given by the Gov.-General to reprisal excited\r\nthe cupidity of unscrupulous officials, and, without apparent right\r\nor reason, the _Maestre de Campo_ of Zamboanga caused a Chinese\r\njunk from Amoy, carrying goods to a friendly Sultan of Mindanao, to\r\nbe seized. After tedious delay, vexation, and privation, the master\r\nand his crew were released and a part of the cargo restored, but the\r\n_Maestre de Campo_ insisted upon retaining what he chose for his own\r\nuse. This treachery to an amicable chief exasperated and undeceived the\r\nMindanao Sultan to such a degree that he forthwith took his revenge\r\nby co-operating with the Sulus in making war on the Spaniards. Fresh\r\nfleets of armed canoes replenished the Sulu armadillas, ravaged the\r\ncoasts, hunted down the Spanish priests, and made captives.\r\n\r\nOn the north coast of Mindanao several battles took place. There is a\r\nlegend that over 600 Mahometans advanced to the village of Lubungan,\r\nbut were repulsed by the villagers, who declared their patron, Saint\r\nJames, appeared on horseback to help them. Fray Roque de Santa Monica\r\nwas chased from place to place, hiding in caves and rocks. Being again\r\nmet by four Mahometans, he threatened them with a blunderbuss, and\r\nwas left unmolested. Eventually he was found by friendly natives, and\r\ntaken by them to a wood, where he lived on roots. Thence he journeyed\r\nto Linao, became raving mad, and was sent to Manila, where he died\r\nquite frantic, in the convent of his Order.\r\n\r\nThe Sultan and his fellow-prisoners had been conveyed to Manila\r\nand lodged in the Fortress of Santiago. In 1753 he petitioned the\r\nGov.-General to allow his daughter, the Princess Faatima, and two\r\nslaves to go to Sulu about his private affairs. A permit was granted on\r\ncondition of her returning, or, in exchange for her liberty and that\r\nof her two slaves, to remit 50 captives, and, failing to do either,\r\nthe Sultan and his suite were to be deprived of their dignities\r\nand treated as common slaves, to work in the galleys, and to be\r\nundistinguished among the ordinary prisoners. On these conditions,\r\nthe Princess left, and forwarded 50 slaves, and one more--a Spaniard,\r\nJose de Montesinos--as a present.\r\n\r\nThe Princess Faatima, nevertheless, did return to Manila, bringing\r\nwith her an Ambassador from Prince Bantilan, her uncle and Governor\r\nof Sulu, who, in the meantime, had assumed the title of Sultan\r\nMahamad Miududin. The Ambassador was Prince Mahamad Ismael Datto\r\nMarayalayla. After an audience with the Governor, he went to the fort\r\nto consult with the captive Sultan, and they proposed a treaty with\r\nthe Governor, of which the chief terms were as follows, viz.:--\r\n\r\nAn offensive and defensive alliance.\r\n\r\nAll captives within the Sultanate of Sulu to be surrendered within\r\none year.\r\n\r\nAll articles looted from the churches to be restored within one year.\r\n\r\nOn the fulfilment of these conditions, the Sultan and his people were\r\nto be set at liberty.\r\n\r\nThe treaty was dated in Manila March 3, 1754. The terms were quite\r\nimpossible of accomplishment, for the Sultan, being still in prison,\r\nhad no power to enforce commands on his subjects.\r\n\r\nThe war was continued at great sacrifice to the State and with little\r\nbenefit to the Spaniards, whilst their operations were greatly retarded\r\nby discord between the officials of the expedition, the authorities\r\non shore, and the priests. At the same time, dilatory proceedings\r\nwere being taken against the _Maestre de Campo_ of Zamboanga, who was\r\ncharged with having appropriated to himself others' share of the war\r\nbooty. Siargao Island (off the N.E. point of Mindanao Is.) had been\r\ncompletely overrun by the Mahometans; the villages and cultivated\r\nland were laid waste, and the Spanish priest was killed.\r\n\r\nWhen the Governor Pedro de Arandia arrived in 1754, the Sultan\r\ntook advantage of the occasion to put his case before him. He had,\r\nindeed, experienced some of the strangest mutations of fortune, and\r\nArandia had compassion on him. By Arandia's persuasion, the Archbishop\r\nvisited and spiritually examined him, and then the Sultan confessed\r\nand took the Communion. In the College of Santa Potenciana there was\r\na Mahometan woman who had been a concubine of the Sultan, but who now\r\nprofessed Christianity, and had taken the name of Rita Calderon. The\r\nSultan's wife having died, he asked for this ex-concubine in marriage,\r\nand the favour was conceded to him. The nuptials were celebrated\r\nin the Governor's Palace on April 27, 1755, and the espoused couple\r\nreturned to their prison with an allowance of 50 pesos per month for\r\ntheir maintenance.\r\n\r\nIn 1755 all the Sultan's relations and suite who had been incarcerated\r\nin Manila, except his son Ismael and a few chiefs, were sent back\r\nto Sulu. The Sultan and his chiefs were then allowed to live freely\r\nwithin the city of Manila, after having sworn before the Governor, on\r\nbended knees, to pay homage to him, and to remain peaceful during the\r\nKing's pleasure. Indeed, Governor Arandia was so favourably disposed\r\ntowards the Sultan Mahamad Alimudin (Ferdinand I.) that personally he\r\nwas willing to restore him to his throne, but his wish only brought\r\nhim in collision with the clergy, and he desisted.\r\n\r\nThe British, after the military occupation of Manila in 1763, took up\r\nthe cause of the Sultan, and reinstated him in Sulu. Then he avenged\r\nhimself on the Spaniards by fomenting incursions against them in\r\nMindanao, which the Gov.-General, Jose Raon, was unable to oppose\r\nfor want of resources. The Mahometans, however, soon proved their\r\nuntrustworthiness to friend and foe alike. Their friendship lasted\r\non the one side so long as danger could thereby be averted from the\r\nother, and a certain Datto Teng-teng attacked the British garrison\r\none night at Balambangan and slaughtered all but six of the troops\r\n(_vide_ pp. 92, 98).\r\n\r\nIn 1836 the sovereignty of the Sultan was distinctly recognized in a\r\ntreaty made between him and Spain, whereby the Sultan had the right\r\nto collect dues on Spanish craft entering Jolo, whilst Sulu vessels\r\npaid dues to the Spaniards in their ports as foreign vessels.\r\n\r\nIn 1844 Gov.-General Narciso Claveria led an expedition against the\r\nMoros and had a desperate, but victorious, struggle with them at\r\nthe fort of Balanguigui (an islet 14 miles due east of Sulu Is.),\r\nfor which he was rewarded with the title of Conde de Manila.\r\n\r\nThe town of Sulu (Jolo) was formerly the residence of the Sultan's\r\nCourt. This Sovereign had arrogantly refused to check the piratical\r\ncruisings made by his people against Spanish subjects in the locality\r\nand about the Islands of Calamianes; therefore, on February 11, 1851,\r\nGeneral Antonio de Urbiztondo, Marquis de la Solana (an ex-Carlist\r\nchief), who had been appointed Gov.-General of the Philippines in\r\nthe previous year, undertook to redress his nation's grievances by\r\nforce. The Spanish flag was hoisted in several places. Sulu town, which\r\nwas shelled by the gunboats, was captured and held by the invaders,\r\nand the Sultan Muhamed Pulalon fled to Maybun on the south coast,\r\nto which place the Court was permanently removed. At the close of\r\nthis expedition another treaty was signed (1851), which provided for\r\nthe annual payment of P1,500 to the Sultan and P600 each to three\r\n_dattos_, on condition that they would suppress piracy and promote\r\nmutual trade. Still the Mahometans paid the Spaniards an occasional\r\nvisit and massacred the garrison, which was as often replaced by\r\nfresh levies.\r\n\r\nIn 1876 the incursions of the Mahometans and the temerity of the\r\nchiefs had again attained such proportions that European dominion over\r\nthe Sulu Sultanate and Mindanao, even in the nominal form in which it\r\nexisted, was sorely menaced. Consequent on this, an expedition, headed\r\nby Vice-Admiral Malcampo, arrived in the waters of the Sultanate,\r\ncarrying troops, with the design of enforcing submission. The chief of\r\nthe land forces appears to have had no topographical plan formed. The\r\nexpedition turned out to be one of discovery. The troops were marched\r\ninto the interior, without their officers knowing where they were\r\ngoing, and they even had to depend on Sulu guides. Naturally, they\r\nwere often deceived, and led to precisely where the Mahometans were\r\nawaiting them in ambush, the result being that great havoc was made in\r\nthe advance column by frequent surprises. Now and again would appear\r\na few _juramentados_, or sworn Mahometans, who sought their way to\r\nAllah by the sacrifice of their own blood, but causing considerable\r\ndestruction to the invading party. With a kris at the waist, a javelin\r\nin one hand, and a shield supported by the other, they would advance\r\nbefore the enemy, dart forward and backwards, make zigzag movements,\r\nand then, with a war-whoop, rush in three or four at a time upon a body\r\nof Christians twenty times their number, giving no quarter, expecting\r\nnone--to die, or to conquer! The expedition was not a failure, but\r\nit gained little. The Spanish flag was hoisted in several places,\r\nincluding Sulu (Jolo), where it remained from February 29, 1876,\r\nuntil the Spanish evacuation of the Islands in 1898.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Mahometans (called by the Spaniards _Moros_) now extend over\r\nnine-tenths of Mindanao Island, and the whole of the Sultanate of\r\nSulu, which comprises Sulu Island (34 miles long from E. to W., and\r\n12 miles in the broadest part from N. to S.) and about 140 others,\r\n80 to 90 of which are uninhabited.\r\n\r\nThe native population of the Sulu Sultanate alone would be about\r\n100,000, including free people, slaves, and some 20,000 men-at-arms\r\nunder orders of the _Dattos_. [61] The domains of His Highness reach\r\nwestward as far as Borneo, where, up to 25 years ago, the Sultanate of\r\nBrunei [62] was actually tributary (and now nominally so) to that of\r\nSulu. The Sultan of Sulu is also feudal lord of two vassal Sultanates\r\nin Mindanao Island. There is, moreover, a half-caste branch of these\r\npeople in the southern half of Palauan Island (Paragua) of a very\r\nsubdued and peaceful nature, compared with the Sulu, nominally under\r\nthe Sulu Sultan's rule.\r\n\r\nIn Mindanao Island only a small coast district here and there was\r\nreally under Spanish empire, although Spain (by virtue of an old\r\ntreaty, which never was respected to the letter) claimed suzerainty\r\nover all the territory subject to the Sultan of Sulu. After the Sulu\r\nwar of 1876 the Sultan admitted the claim more formally, and on March\r\n11, 1877, a protocol was signed by England and Germany recognizing\r\nSpain's rights to the Tawi Tawi group and the chain of islands\r\nstretching from Sulu to Borneo. At the same time it was understood\r\nthat Spain would give visible proof of annexation by establishing\r\nmilitary posts, or occupying these islands in some way, but nothing\r\nwas done until 1880, when Spain was stirred into action by a report\r\nthat the Germans projected a settlement there. A convict corps at\r\nonce took possession, military posts were established, and in 1882\r\nthe 6th Regiment of regular troops was quartered in the group at\r\nBongao and Siassi.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, in 1880, a foreign colonizing company was formed in\r\nthe Sultanate of Brunei, under the title of \"British North Borneo\r\nCo.\" (Royal Charter of November 7, 1881). The company recognized the\r\nsuzerain rights of the Sultan of Sulu, and agreed to pay to him an\r\nannual sum as feudal lord. Spain protested that the territory was hers,\r\nbut could show nothing to confirm the possession. There was no flag,\r\nor a detachment of troops, or anything whatsoever to indicate that the\r\ncoast was under European protection or dominion. Notes were exchanged\r\nbetween the Cabinets of Madrid and London, and Spain relinquished\r\nfor ever her claim to the Borneo fief of Brunei.\r\n\r\nThe experience of the unfortunate Sultan Alimudin (Ferdinand I.) taught\r\nthe Sulu people such a sad lesson that subsequent sultans have not\r\ncared to risk their persons in the hands of the Spaniards. There was,\r\nmoreover, a Nationalist Party which repudiated dependence on Spain, and\r\nhoped to be able eventually to drive out the Spaniards. Therefore, in\r\n1885, when the heir to the throne, Mohammad Jamalul Kiram (who was then\r\nabout 15 years old) was cited to Manila to receive his investiture at\r\nthe hands of the Gov.-General, he refused to comply, and the Government\r\nat once offered the Sultanate to his uncle, Datto Harun Narrasid, who\r\naccepted it, and presented himself to the Gov.-General in the capital.\r\n\r\nThe ceremony of investiture took place in the Government House at\r\nMalacanan near Manila on September 24, 1886, when Datto Harun took\r\nthe oath of allegiance to the King of Spain as his sovereign lord,\r\nand received from the Gov.-General, Emilio Terrero, the title of His\r\nExcellency _Paduca Majasari Maulana Amiril Mauminin Sultan Muhamad\r\nHarun Narrasid_, with the rank of a Spanish lieut.-general. The\r\nGov.-General was attended by his Secretary, the Official Interpreter,\r\nand several high officers. In the suite of the Sultan-elect were his\r\nSecretary, _Tuan Hadji Omar_, a priest, _Pandita Tuan Sik Mustafa_,\r\nand several _dattos_. For the occasion, the Sultan-elect was dressed\r\nin European costume, and wore a Turkish fez with a heavy tassel of\r\nblack silk. His Secretary and Chaplain appeared in long black tunics,\r\nwhite trousers, light shoes, and turbans. Two of the remainder of his\r\nsuite adopted the European fashion, but the others wore rich typical\r\nMoorish vestments.\r\n\r\nThe Sultan returned to his country, and in the course of three months\r\nthe Nationalist Party chiefs openly took up arms against the King of\r\nSpain's nominee, the movement spreading to the adjacent islands of\r\nSiassi and Bongao, which form part of the Sultanate. [63]\r\n\r\nThe Mahometans on the Great Mindanao River, from Cottabato [64]\r\nupwards, openly defied Spanish authority; and in the spring of 1886\r\nthe Government were under the necessity of organizing an expedition\r\nagainst them. The Spaniards had ordered that native craft should\r\ncarry the Spanish flag, otherwise they would be treated as pirates or\r\nrebels. In March, 1887, the cacique of the Simonor ranche (Bongao Is.),\r\nnamed Pandan, refused any longer to hoist the christian ensign, and he\r\nwas pursued and taken prisoner. He was conveyed on the gunboat _Panay_\r\nto Sulu, and on being asked by the Governor why he had ceased to use\r\nthe Spanish flag, he haughtily replied that \"he would only answer such\r\na question to the Captain-General,\" and refused to give any further\r\nexplanation. Within a month after his arrest the garrison of Sulu\r\n(Jolo) was strengthened by 377 men, in expectation of an immediate\r\ngeneral rising, which indeed took place. The Spanish forces were led by\r\nMajors Mattos and Villa Abrille, under the command of Brig.-General\r\nSerina. They were stoutly opposed by a cruel and despotic chief,\r\nnamed Utto, who advanced at the head of his subjects and slaves. With\r\nthe co-operation of the gunboats up the river, the Mahometans were\r\nrepulsed with great loss.\r\n\r\nScores of expeditions had been led against the Mindanao natives,\r\nand their temporary submission had usually been obtained by the\r\nSpaniards--on whose retirement, however, the natives always reverted to\r\ntheir old customs, and took their revenge on the settlers. Moreover,\r\nthe petty jealousies existing between the highest officers in the\r\nsouth rendered every peaceful effort fruitless.\r\n\r\nDatto Utto having defiantly proclaimed that no Spaniard should ever\r\nenter his territory, an armed expedition was fitted out; and from the\r\nexample of his predecessor in 1881 (_vide_ p. 124) the Gov.-General,\r\nEmilio Terrero, perchance foresaw in a little war the vision of titles\r\nand more material reward, besides counterbalancing his increasing\r\nunpopularity in Manila, due to the influence of my late friend,\r\nthe Government Secretary Felipe Canga-Argueelles. Following in the\r\nwake of those who had successfully checked the Mahometans in the\r\nprevious spring, he took the chief command in person in the beginning\r\nof January, 1887, to force a recantation of Datto Utto's utterances.\r\n\r\nThe petty Sultans of Bacat, Buhayen and Kudarangan in vain united\r\ntheir fortunes with those of Utto. The stockades of cocoanut trunks,\r\n_palma-bravas_ (q.v.) and earth (_cottas_) were easily destroyed by\r\nthe Spanish artillery, and their defenders fled under a desultory\r\nfire. There were very few casualties on either side. Some of the\r\nChristian native infantry soldiers suffered from the bamboo spikes\r\n(Spanish, _puas_) set in the ground around the stockades, but the\r\nenemy had not had time to cover with brushwood the pits dug for the\r\nattacking party to fall into. In about two months the operations ended\r\nby the submission of some chiefs of minor importance and influence;\r\nand after spending so much powder and shot and Christian blood, the\r\nGeneral had not even the satisfaction of seeing either the man he was\r\nfighting against or his enemy's ally, the Sultan of Kudarangan. This\r\nlatter sent a priest, Pandita Kalibaudang, and Datto Andig to sue for\r\npeace and cajole the General with the fairest promises. Afterwards\r\nthe son and heir of this chief, Rajahmudah Tambilanang, presented\r\nhimself, and he and his suite of 30 followers were conducted to\r\nthe camp in the steam launch _Carriedo_. Utto, whose residence had\r\nbeen demolished, had not deigned to submit in person, but sent, as\r\nemissaries, Dattos Sirungang, Buat and Dalandung, who excused only\r\nthe absence of Utto's prime minister. Capitulations of peace were\r\nhanded to Utto's subordinates, who were told to bring them back signed\r\nwithout delay, for despatches from the Home Government, received four\r\nor five weeks previously, were urging the General to conclude this\r\naffair as speedily as possible. They were returned signed by Utto--or\r\nby somebody else--and the same signature and another, supposed to be\r\nthat of his wife, the Ranee Pudtli (a woman of great sway amongst her\r\npeople) were also attached to a letter, offering complete submission.\r\n\r\nThe Spaniards destroyed a large quantity of rice-paddy, and stipulated\r\nfor the subsequent payment of a war indemnity in the form of cannons\r\n(_lantacas_), buffaloes, and horses.\r\n\r\nThe General gave the emissaries some trifling presents, and they went\r\ntheir way and he his,--to Manila, which he entered in state on March\r\n21, with flags flying, music playing, and the streets decorated with\r\nbunting of the national colours, to give welcome to the conqueror\r\nof the Mahometan chief--whom he had never seen--the bearer of peace\r\ncapitulations signed--by whom? As usual, a _Te Deum_ was celebrated\r\nin the Cathedral for the victories gained over the infidels; the\r\nofficers and troops who had returned were invited by the Municipality\r\nto a theatrical performance, and the Gov.-General held a reception in\r\nthe Palace of Malacanan. Some of the troops were left in Mindanao,\r\nit having been resolved to establish armed outposts still farther\r\nup the river for the better protection of the port and settlement\r\nof Cottabato.\r\n\r\nWhilst the Gov.-General headed this military parade in the Cottabato\r\ndistrict, the ill-feeling of the Sulu natives towards the Spaniards\r\nwas gradually maturing. An impending struggle was evident, and\r\nColonel Juan Arolas, the Governor of Sulu, concentrated his forces in\r\nexpectation. The Sulus, always armed, prepared for events in their\r\n_cottas_; Arolas demanded their surrender, which was refused, and\r\nthey were attacked. Two _cottas_, well defended, were ultimately\r\ntaken, not without serious loss to the Spaniards. In the report\r\nof the slain a captain was mentioned. Arolas then twice asked for\r\nauthority to attack the Mahometans at Maybun, and was each time\r\nrefused. At length, acting on his own responsibility, on April 15,\r\n1887, he ordered a gunboat to steam round to Maybun and open fire at\r\ndaybreak on the Sultan's capital, which was in possession of the party\r\nopposed to the Spanish nominee (Harun Narrasid). At 11 o'clock the\r\nsame night he started across country with his troops towards Maybun,\r\nand the next morning, whilst the enemy was engaged with the gunboat,\r\nhe led the attack on the land side. The Mahometans, quite surprised,\r\nfought like lions, but were completely routed, and the seat of the\r\nSultanate was razed to the ground. It was the most crushing defeat\r\never inflicted on the Sulu Nationalist Party. The news reached Manila\r\non April 29, and great praise was justly accorded to Colonel Arolas,\r\nwhose energetic operations contrasted so favourably with the Cottabato\r\nexpedition. All manner of festivities in his honour were projected\r\nin Manila, but Arolas elected to continue the work of subduing the\r\nMoro country. Notwithstanding his well-known republican tendencies,\r\non September 20, 1887, the Queen-Regent cabled through her Ministry her\r\nacknowledgment of Colonel Arolas' valuable services, and the pleasure\r\nit gave her to reward him with a Brig.-General's commission. [65]\r\n\r\nIn 1895 an expedition against the Mahometans was organized under the\r\nsupreme command of Gov.-General Ramon Blanco. It was known as the\r\nMarahui (or Marauit) Campaign. The tribes around Lake Lanao (ancient\r\nname Malanao) and the Marahui district had, for some time past, made\r\nserious raids on the Spanish settlement at Yligan, which is connected\r\nwith Lake Lanao by a river navigable only by canoes. Indeed, the lives\r\nand property of Christians in all the territory adjoining Yligan were\r\nin great jeopardy, and the Spanish authorities were set at defiance. It\r\nwas therefore resolved, for the first time, to attack the tribes and\r\ndestroy their _cottas_ around the lake for the permanent tranquillity\r\nof Yligan. The Spanish and native troops alike suffered great hardships\r\nand privations. Steam launches in sections (constructed in Hong-Kong),\r\nsmall guns, and war material were carried up from Yligan to the lake by\r\nnatives over very rugged ground. On the lake shore the launches were\r\nfitted up and operated on the lake, to the immense surprise of the\r\ntribes. From the land side their _cottas_ were attacked and destroyed,\r\nunder the command of my old friend Brig.-General Gonzalez Parrado. The\r\noperations, which lasted about three months, were a complete success,\r\nand General Gonzalez Parrado was rewarded with promotion to General\r\nof Division. Lake Lanao, with the surrounding district and the route\r\ndown to Yligan, was in possession of the Spaniards, and in order to\r\nretain that possession without the expense of maintaining a large\r\nmilitary establishment, it was determined to people the conquered\r\nterritory with Christian families from Luzon and the other islands\r\nsituated north of Mindanao. It was the attempt to carry out this\r\ncolonizing scheme which gave significance to the Marahui Expedition\r\nand contributed to that movement which, in 1896, led to the downfall\r\nof Spanish rule in the Archipelago.\r\n\r\nThe last Spanish punitive expedition against the Mindanao Mahometans\r\nwas sent in February, 1898, under the command of General Buille. The\r\noperations lasted only a few days. The enemy was driven into the\r\ninterior with great loss, and one chief was slain. The small gunboats\r\nbuilt in Hong-Kong for the Marahui Campaign--the _General Blanco,\r\nCorcuera_, and _Lanao_--again did good service.\r\n\r\nThere are three branches or tribes of the _Malanao_ Moros around the\r\nLake Lanao:\r\n\r\n(1) _Bayabos_, at the north of the Lake, their centre being Marahui.\r\n\r\n(2) _Onayans_, at the south of the Lake, their centre being Bayan.\r\n\r\n(3) _Macui_ tribe includes the remaining Lake Lanao people, except a\r\nfew independent ranches to the east of the Macui, belonging to the\r\nBayabos. The Macui claim to be the most ancient, although no tribe\r\ncan trace descent farther back than the 13th century. Intermarriage\r\nhas destroyed traces, but there are over a hundred sultans who claim\r\nto be of royal blood.\r\n\r\nThe other principal Mindanao tribes are as follows, viz.:--_Aetas_,\r\nin the regions near Mount Apo (_vide_ p. 121).\r\n\r\n_Bagobos_, on the foothills of Mount Apo. A peaceful people, disposed\r\nto work, and reputed to be human sacrificers.\r\n\r\n_Manobos_, in the valley of the Agusan River. There are also some on\r\nthe Gulf of Davao and in the Cottabato district.\r\n\r\n_Samales_ inhabit the small islands in the Gulf of Davao, but there\r\nis quite a large colony of them at Magay, a suburb of Zamboanga,\r\n(from the neighbouring islets) under Rajahmudah Datto Mandi.\r\n\r\n_Subuanos_ occupy the peninsula of the Zamboanga Province. They\r\nare docile and lazy, and much prone to stealing. They are far\r\nless courageous than the _Samales_, by whom they are overawed. Some\r\nphysiognomists consider them to be of the same caste as the _Manobos_,\r\nthe _Guimbanos_ of Sulu, and the _Samecas_ of Basilan.\r\n\r\n_Tagubans_ live on the north shore of the Gulf of Davao.\r\n\r\n_Tirurayas_ inhabit the mountains to the west of the Rio Grande.\r\n\r\nThere is a large number of smaller tribes.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nA few years ago we were all alarmed on Corpus Christi Day, during the\r\nsolemn procession of that feast in Cottabato, by the sudden attack of\r\na few Mahometans on the crowd of Christians assembled. Of course the\r\nformer were overwhelmed and killed, as they quite expected to be. They\r\nwere of that class known as _juramentados_, or sworn Mahometans, who\r\nbelieve that if they make a solemn vow, in a form binding on their\r\nconsciences, to die taking the blood of a Christian, their souls will\r\nimmediately migrate to the happy hunting-ground, where they will ever\r\nlive in bliss, in the presence of the Great Prophet. This is the most\r\ndangerous sect of Mahometans, for no exhibition of force can suffice\r\nto stay their ravages, and they can only be treated like mad dogs,\r\nor like a Malay who has run _amok_.\r\n\r\nThe face of a Mindanao south coast Moro is generally pleasant, but\r\na smile spoils his appearance; the parting lips disclose a filthy\r\naperture with dyed teeth in a mahogany coloured foam of masticated\r\nbetel-nut. Holes as large as sixpences are in the ears of the women,\r\nwho, when they have no ear-rings, wear a piece of reed with a vermilion\r\ntip. The dress is artistically fantastic, with the _sarong_ and\r\nthe _jabul_ and no trousers visible. Apparently the large majority\r\n(perhaps 70 per cent.) of the Parang-Parang Moros have a loathsome\r\nskin disease. Those who live on shore crop their hair, but the swamp,\r\nriver, and sea people who live afloat let it grow long.\r\n\r\nThe Sulu Islanders, male and female, dress with far greater taste and\r\nascetic originality than the christian natives. The women are fond\r\nof gay colours, the predominant ones being scarlet and green. Their\r\nnether bifurcated garment is very baggy, the bodice is extremely tight,\r\nand, with equally close-fitting sleeves, exhibits every contour of\r\nthe bust and arms. They use also a strip of stuff sewn together at\r\nthe ends called the _jabul_, which serves to protect the head from\r\nthe sun-rays. The end of the _jabul_ would reach nearly down to\r\nthe feet, but is usually held _retrousse_ under the arm. They have\r\na passion for jewellery, and wear many finger-rings of metal and\r\nsometimes of sea-shells, whilst their ear-rings are gaudy and of\r\nlarge dimensions. The hair is gracefully tied in a coil on the top\r\nof the head, and their features are at least as attractive as those\r\nof the generality of Philippine christian women.\r\n\r\nThe men wear breeches of bright colours, as tight as gymnasts'\r\npantaloons, with a large number of buttons up the sides; a kind of\r\nwaistcoat buttoning up to the throat; a jacket reaching to the hips,\r\nwith close sleeves, and a turban. A chief's dress has many adornments\r\nof trinkets, and is quite elegant, a necessary part of his outfit\r\nbeing the _barong_ (sword), which apparently he carries constantly.\r\n\r\nThey are robust, of medium height, often of superb physical\r\ndevelopment; of a dusky bronze colour, piercing eyes, low forehead,\r\nlank hair, which is dressed as a chignon and hangs down the back of\r\nthe neck. The body is agile, the whole movement is rapid, and they\r\nhave a wonderful power of holding the breath under water. They are\r\nof quick perception, audacious, haughty, resolute, zealous about\r\ntheir genealogies; extremely sober, ready to promise everything\r\nand do nothing, vindictive and highly suspicious of a stranger's\r\nintentions. Their bearing towards the Christian, whom they call\r\nthe infidel, is full of contempt. They know no gratitude, and they\r\nwould not cringe to the greatest Christian potentate. They are very\r\nlong-suffering in adversity, hesitating in attack, and the bravest\r\nof the brave in defence. They disdain work as degrading and only\r\na fit occupation for slaves, whilst warfare is, to their minds, an\r\nhonourable calling. Every male over 16 years of age has to carry at\r\nleast one fighting-weapon at all times, and consider himself enrolled\r\nin military service.\r\n\r\nThey have a certain knowledge of the Arts. They manufacture on the\r\nanvil very fine kris daggers, knives, lance-heads, etc. Many of their\r\nfighting-weapons are inlaid with silver and set in polished hardwood\r\nor ivory handles artistically carved.\r\n\r\nIn warfare they carry shields, and their usual arms on land are\r\nthe _campilan_, a kind of short two-handed sword, wide at the tip\r\nand narrowing down to the hilt, the _barong_ for close combat, the\r\nstraight _kris_ for thrusting and cutting, and the waved, serpent-like\r\n_kris_ for thrusting only. They are dexterous in the use of arms,\r\nand can most skilfully decapitate a foe at a single stroke. At sea\r\nthey use a sort of assegai, called _bagsacay_ or _simbilin_, about\r\nhalf an inch in diameter, with a sharp point. Some can throw as many\r\nas four at a time, and make them spread in the flight; they use these\r\nfor boarding vessels. They make many of their own domestic utensils of\r\nmetal, also coats of mail of metal wire and buffalo horn, which resist\r\nhand-weapons, but not bullets. The wire probably comes from Singapore.\r\n\r\nThe local trade is chiefly in pearls, mother-of-pearl, shells,\r\nshark fins, etc. [66] The Sultan, in Spanish times, had a sovereign\r\nright to all pearls found which exceeded a certain size fixed by\r\nSulu law--hence it was very difficult to secure an extraordinary\r\nspecimen. The Mahometans trade at great distances in their small craft,\r\ncalled _vintas_, for they are wonderfully expert navigators. Their\r\nlargest vessels do not exceed seven tons, and they go as far as Borneo,\r\nand even down to Singapore on rare occasions.\r\n\r\nI found that almost any coinage was useful for purchasing in the\r\nmarket-places. I need hardly add that the Chinese small traders have\r\nfound their way to these regions; and it would be an unfavourable\r\nsign if a Chinaman were not to be seen there, for where the frugal\r\nCelestial cannot earn a living one may well assume there is little\r\nprosperity. Small Chinese coins (known as _cash_ in the China Treaty\r\nPorts) are current money there, and I think, the most convenient\r\nof all copper coins, for, having a hole in the centre, they can be\r\nstrung together. Chinese began to trade with this island in 1751.\r\n\r\nThe root of the Sulu language is Sanscrit, mixed with Arabic. Each\r\nFriday is dedicated to public worship, and the faithful are called\r\nto the temple by the beating of a box or hollow piece of wood. All\r\nrecite the Iman with a plaintive voice in honour of the Great Prophet;\r\na slight gesticulation is then made whilst the _Pandita_ reads a\r\npassage from the Mustah. I observed that no young women put in an\r\nappearance at the temple on the occasion of my visit.\r\n\r\nAt the beginning of each year there is a very solemn ceremonial, and,\r\nin the event of the birth or death of a child, or the safe return\r\nfrom some expedition, it is repeated. It is a sort of _Te Deum_ in\r\nconformity with Mahometan rites. During a number of days in a certain\r\nmonth of the year they abstain from eating, drinking, and pleasure\r\nof all kinds, and suffer many forms of voluntary penance. Strangers\r\nare never allowed, I was told, inside the Mosque of the Sultan. The\r\nhigher clergy are represented by the hereditary _Cherif_, who has\r\ntemporal power also. The title of _Pandita_ simply means priest, and\r\nis the common word used in Mindanao as well as in Palauan Island. He\r\nseems to be almost the chief in his district--not in a warlike sense,\r\nlike the _Datto_; but his word has great influence. He performs all\r\nthe functions of a priest, receives the vow of the _juramentados_,\r\nand expounds the mysteries and the glories of that better world whither\r\nthey will go without delay if they die taking the blood of a Christian.\r\n\r\nIn theory, the Moros accept the Koran and the teachings of Mahomet:\r\nin practice, they omit the virtues of their religious system and\r\nfollow those precepts which can be construed into favouring vice;\r\nhence they interpret guidance of the people by oppression, polygamy\r\nby licentiousness, and maintenance of the faith by bloodshed. Relays\r\nof Arabs come, from time to time, under the guise of Koran expounders,\r\nto feed on the people and whet their animosity towards the Christian.\r\n\r\nThe _Panditas_ are doctors also. If a _Datto_ dies, they intone a\r\ndolorous chant; the family bursts into lamentations, which are finally\r\ndrowned in the din of the clashing of cymbals and beating of gongs,\r\nwhilst sometimes a gun is fired. In rush the neighbours, and join in\r\nthe shouting, until all settle down quietly to a feast. The body is\r\nthen sprinkled with salt and camphor and dressed in white, with the\r\nkris attached to the waist. There is little ceremony about placing\r\nthe body in the coffin and burying it. The mortuary is marked by a\r\nwooden tablet--sometimes by a stone, on which is an inscription in\r\nArabic. A slip of board, or bamboo, is placed around the spot, and a\r\npiece of wood, carved like the bows of a canoe, is stuck in the earth;\r\nin front of this is placed a cocoanut shell full of water.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe old native town, or _cotta_ of Sulu (Jolo) was a collection of\r\nbamboo houses built upon piles extending a few hundred yards into the\r\nsea. This was all demolished by the Spaniards when they permanently\r\noccupied the place in 1876, excepting the Military Hospital, which\r\nwas re-constructed of light materials, native fashion. The sea-beach\r\nwas cleared, and the native village put back inland.\r\n\r\nThe site is an extremely pretty little bay on the north of the island,\r\nformed by the points Dangapic and Candea, and exactly in front,\r\nabout four or five miles off, there are several low-lying islets,\r\nwell wooded, with a hill abruptly jutting out here and there, the\r\nwhole forming a picturesque miniature archipelago.\r\n\r\nLooking from the sea, in the centre stands the modern Spanish town of\r\nSulu (Jolo), built on the shore, rising about a couple of yards above\r\nsea-level, around which there is a short stone and brick sea-wall, with\r\nseveral bends pleasantly relieving the monotony of a straight line.\r\n\r\nForming a background to the European town, there are three thickly\r\nwooded hillocks almost identical in appearance, and at each extremity\r\nof the picture, lying farther back inland, there is a hill sloping\r\ndown gradually towards the coast. The slope on the eastern extremity\r\nhas been cleared of undergrowth to the extent of about 50 acres,\r\ngiving it the appearance of a vast lawn. At the eastern and western\r\nextremities are the native suburbs, with huts of light material built a\r\nfew yards into the sea. On the east side there is a big Moro bungalow,\r\nerected on small tree-trunks, quite a hundred yards from the beach\r\nseawards. To the west, one sees a long shanty-built structure running\r\nout to sea like a jetty; it is the shore market. The panorama could\r\nnot be more charming and curious. Still farther west, towering above\r\nevery other, stands the _Bad Tumantangas_ peak (Mount of Tears),\r\nthe last point discernible by the westward-journeying Joloano, who\r\nis said to sigh with patriotic anguish at its loss to view, with all\r\nthe feeling of a Moorish Boabdil bidding adieu to his beloved Granada.\r\n\r\nThe town is uniformly planned, with well-drained streets, running\r\nparallel, crossed at rectangles by lovely avenues of shading\r\ntrees. Here and there are squares, pretty gardens, and a clean and\r\norderly market-place. There is a simple edifice for a church, splendid\r\nbarracks equal to those in Manila when these were built, many houses of\r\nbrick and stone, others of wood, and all roofed with corrugated iron.\r\n\r\nThe neighbourhood is well provided with water from natural streams. The\r\ntown is supplied with drinking-water conducted in pipes, laid for the\r\npurpose from a spring about a mile and a quarter distant, whilst other\r\npiping carries water to the end of the pier for the requirements of\r\nshipping. This improvement, the present salubrity of the town (once a\r\nfever focus), and its latest Spanish embellishments, are mainly due to\r\nthe intelligent activity of its late Governors, Colonel (now General)\r\nGonzalez Parrado, and the late General Juan Arolas.\r\n\r\nThe town is encircled on the land side by a brick loop-holed wall. The\r\noutside (Spanish) defences consisted of two forts, viz:--The \"_Princesa\r\nde Asturias_\" and \"_Torre de la Reina_\" and within the town those of\r\nthe \"_Puerta Blockaus_\", \"_Puerta Espana_\" and the redoubt \"_Alfonso\r\nXII._\"--this last had a Nordenfeldt gun.\r\n\r\nThe Spanish Government of Sulu was entirely under martial law, and\r\nthe Europeans (mostly military men) were constantly on the alert for\r\nthe ever-recurring attacks of the natives.\r\n\r\nThe general aspect of Sulu (Jolo) is cheerful and attractive. The day\r\nscene, enlivened by the Moro, passing to and fro with his lithe gait,\r\nin gay attire, with the _barong_ in a huge sash, and every white man,\r\nsoldier or civilian, carrying arms in self-defence, may well inflame\r\nthe imaginative and romantic mind. One can hardly believe one is\r\nstill in the Philippines. At night, the shaded avenues, bordered by\r\nstately trees, illuminated by a hundred lamps, present a beautiful,\r\npicturesque scene which carries the memory far, far away from the\r\nsurrounding savage races. Yet all may change in a trice. There is\r\na hue and cry; a Moro has run _amok_--his glistening weapon within\r\na foot of his escaping victim; the Christian native hiding away in\r\nfear, and the European off in pursuit of the common foe; there is a\r\ntramping of feet, a cracking of firearms; the Moro is biting the dust,\r\nand the memory is brought abruptly back from imagination's flights\r\nto full realization of one's Mahometan _entourage_.\r\n\r\nBy a decree dated September 24, 1877, all the natives, and other\r\nraces or nationalities settled there, were exempted from all kinds of\r\ncontributions or taxes for 10 years. In 1887 the term was extended for\r\nanother 10 years; hence, no imposts being levied, all the Spaniards\r\nhad to do was to maintain their prestige with peace.\r\n\r\nIn his relations with the Spaniards, the Sultan held the title\r\nof Excellency, and he, as well as several chiefs, received annual\r\npensions from the Government at the following rates:--\r\n\r\n\r\n                                                        Pesos.\r\n        Sultan of Sulu                                  2,400\r\n        Sultan of Mindanao                              1,000\r\n        Datto Beraduren, heir to the Sulu Sultanate       700\r\n        Paduca Datto Alimudin, of Sulu                    600\r\n        Datto Amiral, of Mindanao                         800\r\n        Other minor pensions                              600\r\n                                                        =====\r\n                                                       P6,100\r\n\r\n\r\nand an allowance of 2 pesos for each captive rescued, and 3 pesos\r\nfor each pirate caught, whether in Sulu or Mindanao waters.\r\n\r\nThe Sultan is the _Majasari_ (the stainless, the spotless)--the\r\nPontiff-king--the chief of the State and the Church; but it is said\r\nthat he acknowledges the Sultan of Turkey as the _Padishah_. He is\r\nthe irresponsible lord and master of all life and property among his\r\nsubjects, although in his decrees he is advised by a Council of Elders.\r\n\r\nNevertheless, in spite of his absolute authority, he does not seem to\r\nhave perfect control over the acts of his nobles or chiefs, who are\r\na privileged class, and are constantly waging some petty war among\r\nthemselves, or organizing a marauding expedition along the coast. The\r\nSultan is compelled, to a certain extent, to tolerate their excesses,\r\nas his own dignity, or at least his own tranquillity, is in a great\r\nmeasure dependent on their common goodwill towards him. The chiefs\r\ncollect tribute in the name of the Sultan, but they probably furnish\r\ntheir own wants first and pay differences into the Royal Treasury,\r\nseeing that it all comes from their own feudal dependents.\r\n\r\nThe Sultan claims to be the nominal owner of all the product of Sulu\r\nwaters. In the valuable Pearl Fisheries he claims to have a prior\r\nright to all pearls above a certain value, although the finder is\r\nentitled to a relative bounty from the Sultan. \"Ambal,\" a product found\r\nfloating on the waters and much esteemed by the Chinese as medicine,\r\nis subject to royal dues. The great pearl-fishing centre is Siassi\r\nIsland (in the Tapul group), lying about 20 miles south of Sulu Island.\r\n\r\nThe Sultanate is hereditary under the Salic Law. The Sultan is\r\nsupported by three ministers, one of whom acts as Regent in his absence\r\n(for he might choose to go to Singapore, or have to go to Mecca,\r\nif he had not previously done so); the other is Minister of War,\r\nand the third is Minister of Justice and Master of the Ceremonies.\r\n\r\nSlavery exists in a most ample sense. There are slaves by birth and\r\nothers by conquest, such as prisoners of war, insolvent debtors, and\r\nthose seized by piratical expeditions to other islands. A creole friend\r\nof mine was one of these last. He had commenced clearing an estate for\r\ncane-growing on the Negros coast, when he was seized and carried off\r\nto Sulu Island. In a few years he was ransomed and returned to Negros,\r\nwhere be formed one of the finest sugar haciendas and factories in\r\nthe Colony.\r\n\r\nIn 1884 a Mahometan was found on a desolate isle lying off the Antique\r\ncoast (Panay Is.), and of course had no document of identity, so he\r\nwas arrested and confined in the jail of San Jose de Buenavista. From\r\nprison he was eventually taken to the residence of the Spanish\r\nGovernor, Don Manuel Castellon, a very humane gentleman and a personal\r\nfriend of mine. In Don Manuel's study there was a collection of\r\nnative arms which took the stranger's fancy; one morning he seized\r\na kris and lance, and, bounding into the breakfast-room, capered\r\nabout, gesticulated, and brandished the lance in the air, much to the\r\namusement of the Governor and his guests. But in an instant the fellow\r\n(hitherto a mystery, but undoubtedly a _juramentado_) hurled the lance\r\nwith great force towards the Public Prosecutor, and the missile, after\r\nsevering his watch-chain, lodged in the side of the table. The Governor\r\nand the Public Prosecutor at once closed with the would-be assassin,\r\nwhilst the Governor's wife, with great presence of mind, thrust a\r\ntable-knife into the culprit's body between the shoulder-blade and\r\nthe collar-bone. The man fell, and, when all supposed he was dead,\r\nhe suddenly jumped up. No one had thought of taking the kris out of\r\nhis grasp, and he rushed around the apartment and severely cut two of\r\nthe servants, but was ultimately despatched by the bayonets of the\r\nguards who arrived on hearing the scuffle. The Governor showed me\r\nhis wounds, which were slight, but his life was saved by the valour\r\nof his wife--Dona Justa.\r\n\r\nIt has often been remarked by old residents, that if free licence were\r\ngranted to the domesticated natives, their barbarous instincts would\r\nrecur to them in all vigour. Here was an instance. The body of the\r\nMoro was carried off by an excited populace, who tied a rope to it,\r\nbeat it, and dragged it through the town to a few miles up the coast,\r\nwhere it was thrown on the sea-shore. The priests did not interfere;\r\nlike the Egyptian mummies cast on the Stygian shores, the culprit\r\nwas unworthy of sepulture--besides, who would pay the fees?\r\n\r\nDuring my first visit to Sulu in 1881, I was dining with the Governor,\r\nwhen the conversation ran on the details of an expedition about to be\r\nsent to Maybun, to carry despatches received from the Gov.-General\r\nfor the Sultan, anent the Protectorate. The Governor seemed rather\r\nsurprised when I expressed my wish to join the party, for the journey\r\nis not unattended with risk to one's life. [I may here mention that\r\nonly a few days before I arrived, a young officer was sent on some\r\nmission a short distance outside the town of Jolo, accompanied by a\r\npatrol of two guards. He was met by armed Mahometans, and sent back\r\nwith one of his hands cut off. I remember, also, the news reaching\r\nus that several military officers were sitting outside a cafe in\r\nJolo Town, when a number of _juramentados_ came behind them and cut\r\ntheir throats.] However, the Governor did not oppose my wish--on the\r\ncontrary, he jocosely replied that he could not extend my passport so\r\nfar, because the Sulus would not respect it, yet the more Europeans\r\nthe better.\r\n\r\nOfficials usually went by sea to Maybun, and a gunboat was now and\r\nagain sent round the coast with messages to the Sultan, but there\r\nwas no Government vessel in Jolo at this time.\r\n\r\nOur party, all told, including the native attendants, numbered about\r\n30 Christians, and we started early in the morning on horseback. I\r\ncarried my usual weapon--a revolver--hoping there would be no need to\r\nuse it on the journey. And so it resulted; we arrived, without being\r\nmolested in any way, in about three hours, across a beautiful country.\r\n\r\nWe passed two low ranges of hills, which appeared to run from S.W. to\r\nN.E., and several small streams, whilst here and there was a ranche\r\nof the Sultan's subjects. Each ranche was formed of a group of\r\n10 to 20 huts, controlled by the cacique. Agriculture seemed to\r\nbe pursued in a very pristine fashion, but, doubtless owing to the\r\nexuberant fertility of the soil, we saw some very nice crops of Rice,\r\nIndian Corn, Sugar Cane, and Indigo and Coffee plantations on a small\r\nscale. In the forest which we traversed there were some of the largest\r\nbamboos I have ever seen, and fine building timber, such as Teak,\r\nNarra, Molave, Mangachapuy, and Camagon (_vide_ Woods). I was assured\r\nthat Cedars also flourished on the island. We saw a great number of\r\nmonkeys, wild pigeons, cranes, and parrots, whilst deer, buffaloes,\r\nand wild goats are said to abound in these parts.\r\n\r\nOn our arrival at Maybun, we went first to the bungalow of a\r\nChinaman--the Sultan's brother-in-law--where we refreshed ourselves\r\nwith our own provisions, and learnt the gossip of the place. On\r\ninquiry, we were told that the Sultan was sleeping, so we waited at\r\nthe Chinaman's. I understood this man was a trader, but there were no\r\nvisible signs of his doing any business. Most of our party slept the\r\n_siesta_, and at about four o'clock we called at the Palace. It was\r\na very large building, well constructed, and appeared to be built\r\nalmost entirely of materials of the country. A deal of bamboo and\r\nwood were used in it, and even the roof was made of split bamboo,\r\nalthough I am told that this was replaced by sheet-iron when the\r\nyoung Sultan came to the throne. The vestibule was very spacious,\r\nand all around was pleasantly decorated with lovely shrubs and plants\r\npeculiar to most mid-tropical regions. The entrance to the Palace was\r\nalways open, but well guarded, and we were received by three _Dattos_,\r\nwho saluted us in a formal way, and, without waiting to ask us any\r\nquestion, invited us, with a wave of the hand, to follow them into\r\nthe throne-room. [67] The Sultan was seated on our entering, but when\r\nthe bearer of the despatches approached with the official interpreter\r\nby his side, and we following, he rose in his place to greet us.\r\n\r\nHis Highness was dressed in very tight silk trousers, fastened partly\r\nup the sides with showy chased gold or gilt buttons, a short Eton-cut\r\nolive-green jacket with an infinity of buttons, white socks, ornamented\r\nslippers, a red sash around his waist, a kind of turban, and a kris at\r\nhis side. His general appearance was that of a Spanish bull-fighter\r\nwith an Oriental finish off. We all bowed low, and the Sultan,\r\nsurrounded by his Sultanas, put his hands to his temples, and, on\r\nlowering them, he bowed at the same time. We remained standing whilst\r\nsome papers were handed to him. He looked at them--a few words were\r\nsaid in Spanish, to the effect that the bearer saluted His Highness\r\nin the name of the Governor of Sulu. The Sultan passed the documents\r\nto the official interpreter, who read or explained them in the Sulu\r\nlanguage; then a brief conversation ensued, through the interpreter,\r\nand the business was really over. After a short pause, the Sultan\r\nmotioned to us to be seated on floor-cushions, and we complied. The\r\ncushions, covered with rich silk, were very comfortable. Servants, in\r\nfantastic costumes, were constantly in attendance, serving betel-nut\r\nto those who cared to chew it.\r\n\r\nOne Sultana was fairly pretty, or had been so, but the others were\r\nheavy, languid, and lazy in their movements; and their teeth,\r\ndyed black, did not embellish their personal appearance. The\r\nSultan made various inquiries, and passed many compliments on us,\r\nthe Governor, Gov.-General, etc., which were conveyed to us through\r\nthe interpreter. Meanwhile, the Sultanas chatted among themselves,\r\nand were apparently as much interested in looking at us as we were\r\nin their style, features, and attire. They all wore light-coloured\r\n\"dual garments\" of great width, and tight bodices. Their _coiffure_\r\nwas carefully finished, but a part of the forehead was hidden by an\r\nungraceful fringe of hair.\r\n\r\nWe had so little in common to converse on, and that little had to\r\nbe said through the interpreter, that we were rather glad when we\r\nwere asked to take refreshments. It at least served to relieve the\r\nawkward feeling of glancing at each other in silence. Chocolate and\r\nornamental sweetmeats were brought to us, all very unpalatable. When we\r\nwere about to take our departure, the Sultan invited us to remain all\r\nnight in the Palace. The leader of our party caused to be explained\r\nto him that we were thankful for his gracious offer, but that, being\r\nso numerous, we feared to disturb His Highness by intruding so far\r\non his hospitality. Still the Sultan politely insisted, and whilst\r\nthe interpretation was being transmitted I found an opportunity to\r\nacquaint our chief of my burning curiosity to stay at the Palace. In\r\nany case, we were a large number to go anywhere, so our leader, in\r\nreply to the Sultan, said that he and four Europeans of his suite\r\nwould take advantage of His Highness's kindness.\r\n\r\nWe withdrew from the Sultan's presence, and some of us Europeans\r\nwalked through the town accompanied by functionaries of the royal\r\nhousehold and the interpreter. There was nothing striking in the\r\nplace; it was like most others. There were some good bungalows of\r\nbamboo and thatching. I noticed that men, women, and children were\r\nsmoking tobacco or chewing, and had no visible occupation. Many of\r\nthe smaller dwellings were built on piles out to the sea. We saw a\r\nnumber of divers preparing to go off to get pearls, mother-of-pearl,\r\netc. They are very expert in this occupation, and dive as deep as 100\r\nfeet. Prior to the plunge they go through a grotesque performance of\r\nwaving their arms in the air and twisting their bodies, in order--as\r\nthey say--to frighten away the sharks; then with a whoop they leap\r\nover the edge of the prahu, and continue to throw their arms and legs\r\nabout for the purpose mentioned. They often dive for the shark and\r\nrip it up with a kris.\r\n\r\nFive of us retired to the Palace that night, and were at once conducted\r\nto our rooms. There was no door to my room; it was, strictly speaking,\r\nan alcove. During the night, at intervals of about every hour, as it\r\nseemed to me, a Palace servant or guard came to inquire how the Senor\r\nwas sleeping, and if I were comfortable. \"Duerme el Senor?\" (\"Does\r\nthe gentleman sleep?\") was apparently the limit of his knowledge of\r\nSpanish. I did not clearly understand more than the fact that the man\r\nwas a nuisance, and I regretted there was no door with which to shut\r\nhim out. The next morning we paid our respects to His Highness, who\r\nfurnished us with an escort--more as a compliment than a necessity--and\r\nwe reached Jolo Town again, after a very enjoyable ride through a\r\nsuperb country.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Sultan's subjects are spread so far from the centre of\r\ngovernment--Maybun--that in some places their allegiance is but\r\nnominal. Many of them residing near the Spanish settlements are quick\r\nat learning Castilian sufficiently well to be understood, but the\r\nSpaniards tried in vain to subject them to a European order of things.\r\n\r\nAbout 20 miles up the coast, going north from Zamboanga, the Jesuits\r\nsent a missionary in 1885 to convert the _Subuanos_. He endeavoured\r\nto persuade the people to form a village. They cleared a way through\r\nthe forest from the beach, and at the end of this opening, about\r\nthree-quarters of a mile long, I found a church half built of wood,\r\nbamboo, and palm-leaves. I had ridden to the place on horseback along\r\nthe beach, and my food and baggage followed in a canoe. The opening\r\nwas so roughly cleared that I thought it better to dismount when\r\nI got half way. As the church was only in course of construction,\r\nand not consecrated, I took up my quarters there. I was followed\r\nby a _Subuano_, who was curious to know the object of my visit. I\r\ntold him I wished to see the headman, so this personage arrived\r\nwith one of his wives and a young girl. They sat on the floor with\r\nme, and as the cacique could make himself understood in Spanish,\r\nwe chatted about the affairs of the town _in posse_. The visiting\r\npriest had gone to the useless trouble of baptizing a few of these\r\npeople. They appeared to be as much Christian as I was Mahometan. The\r\ncacique had more than one wife--the word of the _Pandita_ of the\r\nsettlement was the local law, and the _Pandita_ himself of course had\r\nhis seraglio. I got the first man, who had followed me, to direct me\r\nto the _Pandita's_ house. My guide was gaily attired in bright red\r\ntight acrobat breeches, with buttons up the side, and a jacket like\r\na waistcoat, with sleeves so close-fitting that I suppose he seldom\r\ntook the trouble to undress himself. I left the cacique, promising to\r\nvisit his bungalow that day, and then my guide led me through winding\r\npaths, in a wood, to the hut of the _Pandita_. On the way I met a\r\nman of the tribe carrying spring-water in a bamboo, which he tilted\r\nto give me a drink. To my inquiries if he were a Christian, and if\r\nhe knew the _Castilian Pandita_ (Spanish priest), he replied in the\r\naffirmative; continuing the interrogation, I asked him how many gods\r\nthere were, and when he answered \"four,\" I closed my investigation of\r\nhis Christianity. My guide was too cunning to take me by the direct\r\npath to the _Pandita's_ bungalow. He led me into a half-cleared plot\r\nof land facing it, whence the inmates could see us for at least ten\r\nminutes making our approach. When we arrived, and after scrambling up\r\nthe staircase, which was simply a notched trunk of a tree about nine\r\ninches diameter, I discovered that the _Pandita_, forewarned, had fled\r\nto the mountain close by, leaving his wives to entertain the visitor. I\r\nfound them all lounging and chewing betel-nut, and when I squatted\r\non the floor amongst them they became remarkably chatty. Then I went\r\nto the cacique's bungalow. In the rear of this dwelling there was a\r\nsmall forge, and the most effective bellows of primitive make which I\r\nhave ever seen in any country. It was a double-action apparatus, made\r\nentirely of bamboo, except the pistons, which were of feathers. These\r\npistons, working up and down alternately by a bamboo rod in each hand,\r\nsustained perfectly a constant draught of air. One man was squatting\r\non a bamboo bench the height of the bellows' rods, whilst the smith\r\ncrouched on the ground to forge his kris on the anvil.\r\n\r\nThe headman's bungalow was built the same as the others, but with\r\ngreater care. It was rather high up, and had the usual notched\r\nlog-of-wood staircase, which is perhaps easy to ascend with naked\r\nfeet. The cacique and one of his wives were seated on mats on the\r\nfloor. After mutual salutations the wife threw me three cushions, on\r\nwhich I reclined--doing the _dolce far niente_ whilst we talked about\r\nthe affairs of the settlement. The conversation was growing rather\r\nwearisome anent the Spanish priest having ordered huts to be built\r\nwithout giving materials, about the scarcity of palm-leaves in the\r\nneighbourhood, and so forth, so I bade them farewell and went on to\r\nanother hut. Here the inmates were numerous--four women, three or four\r\nmen, and two rather pretty male children, with their heads shaven so\r\nas to leave only a tuft of hair towards the forehead about the size of\r\na crown piece. To entertain me, six copper tom-toms were brought out,\r\nand placed in a row on pillows, whilst another large one, for the bass\r\naccompaniment, was suspended from a wooden frame. A man beat the bass\r\nwith a stick, whilst the women took it in turns to kneel on the floor,\r\nwith a stick in each hand, to play a tune on the series of six. A few\r\nwords were passed between the three men, when suddenly one of them\r\narose and performed a war-dance, quaintly twisting his arms and legs\r\nin attitudes of advance, recoil, and exultation. The dance finished,\r\nI mounted my horse and left the settlement in embryo, called by the\r\nmissionaries Reus, which is the name of a town in Catalonia.\r\n\r\nThe climate of Mindanao and Sulu Islands is healthy and delightful. The\r\nheat of Zamboanga is moderated by daily breezes, and in Sulu, in the\r\nmonth of June, it is not oppressive. A year's temperature readings\r\non the Illana Bay coast (Mindanao Is.) are as follows, viz.:--\r\n\r\n\r\nAverage of    Inside the House,             Outside in the Shade,\r\n                Fahrenheit.

At the beginning\r\nof the 18th century Spaniards had already settled in the north of\r\nit. It had a very sparse population, and a movement was set on foot\r\nto subjugate the natives. In order to protect the Spanish settlers\r\nfrom Mahometan attacks a fort was established at Labo. However, the\r\nsupplies were not kept up, and many of the garrison died of misery,\r\nhunger, and nakedness, until 1720, when it was abandoned.\r\n\r\nSome years afterwards the island was gratuitously ceded to the\r\nSpaniards by the Sultan of Sulu, at their request. Captain Antonio\r\nFabeau was sent there with troops to take formal possession, being\r\nawarded the handsome salary of P50 per month for this service. On\r\nthe arrival of the ships, an officer was sent ashore; the people\r\nfled inland, and the formalities of annexation were proceeded with\r\nunwitnessed. The only signs of possession left there were the corpses\r\nof the troops and sailors who died from eating rotten food, or were\r\nmurdered by Mahometans who attacked the expedition. Subsequently a\r\nfortress was established at Taytay, where a number of priests and\r\nlaymen in a few years succeeded in forming a small colony, which at\r\nlength shared the fate of Labo. The only Spanish settlement in the\r\nisland at the date of the evacuation was the colony of Puerta Princesa,\r\non the east coast. [68]\r\n\r\nBefore starting on my peregrination in Palauan Island, I sought in vain\r\nfor information respecting the habits and nature of the _Tagbanuas_,\r\na half-caste Malay-Aeta tribe, disseminated over a little more than\r\nthe southern half of the island. [69] It was only on my arrival at\r\nPuerta Princesa that I was able to procure a vague insight into the\r\npeculiarities of the people whom I intended to visit. The Governor,\r\nDon Felipe Canga-Argueelles, was highly pleased to find a traveller\r\nwho could sympathize with his efforts, and help to make known, if\r\nonly to the rest of the Archipelago, this island almost unexplored\r\nin the interior. He constantly wrote articles to one of the leading\r\njournals of Manila, under the title of \"Echoes from Paragua\" (Palauan),\r\npartly with the view of attracting the attention of the Government\r\nto the requirements of the Colony, but also to stimulate a spirit of\r\nenterprise in favour of this island, rich in hardwoods, etc.\r\n\r\nPuerta Princesa is a good harbour, situated on a gulf. The soil\r\nwas levelled, trees were planted, and a slip for repairing vessels\r\nwas constructed. There was a fixed white light visible eleven miles\r\noff. It was a naval station for two gunboats, the Commander of the\r\nstation being _ex-officio_ Governor of the Colony. It was also a\r\nPenal Settlement for convicts, and those suspected by the civil or\r\nreligious authorities. To give employment to the convicts and suspects,\r\na model sugar-estate was established by the Government. The locality\r\nsupplied nearly all the raw material for working and preserving the\r\nestablishment, such as lime, stone, bricks, timber, sand, firewood,\r\nstraw for bags, rattans, etc.\r\n\r\nThe aspect of the town is agreeable, and the environs are pretty,\r\nbut there is a great drawback in the want of drinking-water, which,\r\nin the dry season, has to be procured from a great distance.\r\n\r\nThe Governor showed me great attention, and personally took command of\r\na gunboat, which conducted me to the mouth of the Iguajit River. This\r\nis the great river of the district, and is navigable for about three\r\nmiles. I put off in a boat manned by marines, and was rowed about\r\ntwo miles up, as far as the mission station. The missionary received\r\nme well, and I stayed there that night, with five men, whom I had\r\nengaged to carry my luggage, for we had a journey before us of some\r\ndays on foot to the opposite coast.\r\n\r\nMy luggage, besides the ordinary travelling requisites and provisions,\r\nincluded about 90 yards of printed stuffs of bright colours, six dozen\r\ncommon handkerchiefs, and some 12 pounds' weight of beads on strings,\r\nwith a few odds and ends of trinkets; whilst my native bearers were\r\nprovided with rice, dried fish, betel-nut, tobacco, etc., for a week\r\nor more. We set out on foot the next day, and in three days and a\r\nhalf we reached the western shore.\r\n\r\nThe greatest height above the sea-level on our route was about 900\r\nmetres, according to my aneroid reading, and the maximum heat at\r\nmid-day in the shade (month of January) was 82 deg. Fahr. The nights were\r\ncold, comparatively speaking, and at midnight the thermometer once\r\ndescended to 59 deg. Fahr.\r\n\r\nThe natives proved to be a very pacific people. We found some engaged\r\nin collecting gum from the trees in the forest, and others cutting\r\nand making up bundles of rattans. They took these products down to\r\nthe Iguajit River mission station, where Chinese traders bartered\r\nfor them stuffs and other commodities. The value of coin was not\r\naltogether unknown in the mission village, although the difference\r\nin value between copper and silver coinage was not understood. In\r\nthe interior they lived in great misery, their cabins being wretched\r\nhovels. They planted their rice without ploughing at all, and all\r\ntheir agricultural implements were made of wood or bamboo.\r\n\r\nThe native dress is made of the bark of trees, smashed with stones,\r\nto extract the ligneous parts. In the cool weather they make tunics of\r\nbark, and the women wear drawers of the same material. They adorn their\r\nwaists with sea-shell and cocoanut shell ornaments, whilst the fibre\r\nof the palm serves for a waistband. The women pierce very large holes\r\nin their ears, in which they place shells, wood, etc. They never bathe\r\nintentionally. Their arms are bows and arrows, and darts blown through\r\na kind of pea-shooter made of a reed resembling _bojo_ (q.v). They\r\nare a very dirty people, and they eat their fish or flesh raw.\r\n\r\nI had no difficulty whatever in procuring guides from one group of\r\nhuts to the next on payment in goods, and my instructions were always\r\nto lead me towards the coast, the nearest point of which I knew was\r\ndue west or a few points to the north.\r\n\r\nWe passed through a most fertile country the whole way. There\r\nwere no rivers of any importance, but we were well supplied with\r\ndrinking-water from the numerous springs and rivulets. The forests\r\nare very rich in good timber, chiefly _Ipil_ (_Eperma decandria)_,\r\na very useful hardwood (_vide_ Woods). I estimated that many of these\r\ntrees, if felled, would have given clean logs of 70 to 80 feet long. I\r\npresume the felling of timber was not attempted by these natives\r\non account of the difficulties, or rather, total want of transport\r\nmeans. From a plateau, within half a day's journey of the opposite\r\ncoast, the scenery was remarkably beautiful, with the sea to the west\r\nand an interminable grandeur of forest to the east. There were a few\r\nfishermen on the west coast, but further than that, there was not a\r\nsign of anything beyond the gifts of Nature. About half a mile from the\r\ncoast, on the fringe of the forest, there was a group of native huts,\r\ntwo of which were vacated for our accommodation in exchange for goods.\r\n\r\nWith an abundance of fish, we were able to economize our\r\nprovisions. One of my men fell ill with fever, so that we had to\r\nwait two days on the west coast, whilst I dosed him with Eno's fruit\r\nsalt and quinine. In the meantime, I studied the habits of these\r\npeople. Among the many things which astonished them was the use of\r\nmatches, whilst our cooking highly amused them. Such a thing as a\r\nhorse I suppose had never been seen here, although I would gladly have\r\nbought or hired one, for I was very weary of our delay. We all went\r\non the march again, on foot nearly all the way, by the same passes\r\nto the Iguajit River, where we found a canoe, which carried us back\r\nto Puerta Princesa.\r\n\r\nThe island produces many marketable articles, such as beeswax, edible\r\nbird's nests, fine shells, dried shell-fish, a few pearls, bush-rope\r\nor _palasan_ (q.v.) of enormous length, wild nutmegs, ebony, logwood,\r\netc., which the Chinese obtain in barter for knives and other small\r\nmanufactures.\r\n\r\nThe first survey of the Palauan Island coast is said to have been\r\nmade by the British. A British map of Puerta Princesa, with a few\r\nmiles of adjoining coast, was shown to me in the Government House\r\nof this place. It appears that the west coast is not navigable for\r\nships within at least two miles of the shore, although there are a\r\nfew channels leading to creeks. Vessels coming from the west usually\r\npass through the Straits of Balabac, between the island of that name\r\nand the islets off the Borneo Island coast.\r\n\r\nIn the Island of Balabac there was absolutely nothing remarkable to\r\nbe seen, unless it were a little animal about the size of a big cat,\r\nbut in shape a perfect model of a doe. [70] I took one to Manila,\r\nbut it died the day we arrived. No part of the island (which is\r\nvery mountainous and fertile) appeared to be cultivated, and even\r\nthe officials at the station had to obtain supplies from Manila,\r\nwhilst cattle were brought from the Island of Cuyo, one of the\r\nCalamianes group.\r\n\r\nIn the latter years, the Home Government made efforts to colonize\r\nPalauan Island by offering certain advantages to emigrants. By Royal\r\nOrder, dated February 25, 1885, the Islands of Palauan and Mindanao\r\nwere to be occupied in an effectual manner, and outposts established,\r\nwherever necessary, to guarantee the secure possession of these\r\nislands. The points mentioned for such occupation in Palauan Island\r\nwere Tagbusao and Malihut on the east coast, and Colasian and Malanut\r\non the west coast. It also confirmed the Royal Decree of July 30,\r\n1860, granting to all families emigrating to these newly established\r\nmilitary posts, and all peaceful tribes of the Islands who might\r\nchoose to settle there, exemption from the payment of tribute for six\r\nyears. The families would be furnished with a free passage to these\r\nplaces, and each group would be supplied with seed and implements.\r\n\r\nA subsequent Royal Order, dated January 19, 1886, was issued, to the\r\neffect:--That the Provincial Governors of the Provinces of North and\r\nSouth Ilocos were to stimulate voluntary emigration of the natives\r\nto Palauan Island, to the extent of 25 families from each of the two\r\nprovinces per annum. That any payments due by them to the Public\r\nTreasury were to be condoned. That such families and any persons\r\nof good character who might establish themselves in Palauan should\r\nbe exempt from the payment of taxes for ten years, and receive free\r\npassage there for themselves and their cattle, and three hectares of\r\nland gratis, to be under cultivation within a stated period. That two\r\nchupas of rice (_vide_ Rice measure) and ten cents of a peso should\r\nbe given to each adult, and one chupa of rice to each minor each day\r\nduring the first six months from the date of their embarking. That\r\nthe Governor of Palauan should be instructed respecting the highways\r\nto be constructed, and the convenience of opening free ports in that\r\nisland. That the land and sea forces should be increased; and of\r\nthe latter, a third-rate man-o'-war should be stationed on the west\r\ncoast. That convicts should continue to be sent to Palauan, and the\r\nGovernor should be authorized to employ all those of bad conduct in\r\npublic works. That schools of primary instruction should be established\r\nin the island wherever such might be considered convenient, etc.,\r\netc. [71]\r\n\r\nThe Spaniards (in 1898) left nearly half the Philippine Archipelago\r\nto be conquered, but only its Mahometan inhabitants ever persistently\r\ntook the aggressive against them in regular continuous warfare. The\r\nattempts of the Jesuit missionaries to convert them to Christianity\r\nwere entirely futile, for the _Panditas_ and the Romish priests were\r\nequally tenacious of their respective religious beliefs. The last\r\ntreaty made between Spain and Sulu especially stipulated that the\r\nMahometans should not be persecuted for their religion.\r\n\r\nTo overturn a dynasty, to suppress an organized system of feudal\r\nlaws, and to eradicate an ancient belief, the principles of which\r\nhad firmly established themselves among the populace in the course of\r\ncenturies, was a harder task than that of bringing under the Spanish\r\nyoke detached groups of Malay immigrants. The pliant, credulous nature\r\nof the Luzon settlers--the fact that they professed no deeply-rooted\r\nreligion, and--although advanced from the migratory to the settled\r\ncondition--were mere nominal lieges of their puppet kinglings, were\r\nfacilities for the achievement of conquest. True it is that the\r\ndynasties of the Aztecs of Mexico and the Incas of Peru yielded to\r\nSpanish valour, but there was the incentive of untold wealth; here,\r\nonly of military glory, and the former outweighed the latter.\r\n\r\nIf the Spaniards failed to subjugate the Mahometans, or to incorporate\r\ntheir territory in the general administrative system of the Colony,\r\nafter three centuries of intermittent endeavour, it is difficult to\r\nconceive that the Philippine Republic (had it subsisted) would have\r\nbeen more successful. It would have been useless to have resolved\r\nto leave the Moros to themselves, practically ignoring their\r\nexistence. Any Philippine Government must needs hold them in check\r\nfor the public weal, for the fact is patent that the Moro hates the\r\nnative Christian not one iota less than he does the white man.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XI\r\n\r\nDomesticated Natives--Origin--Character\r\n\r\n\r\nThe generally-accepted theory regarding the origin of the composite\r\nrace which may be termed \"domesticated natives,\" is, that their\r\nancestors migrated to these Islands from Malesia, or the Malay\r\nPeninsula. But so many learned dissertations have emanated from\r\ndistinguished men, propounding conflicting opinions on the descent\r\nof the Malays themselves, that we are still left on the field of\r\nconjecture.\r\n\r\nThere is good reason to surmise that, at some remote period,\r\nthese Islands and the Islands of Formosa and Borneo were united,\r\nand possibly also they conjointly formed a part of the Asiatic\r\nmainland. Many of the islets are mere coral reefs, and some of the\r\nlarger islands are so distinctly of coral formation that, regarded\r\ntogether with the numerous volcanic evidences, one is induced to\r\nbelieve that the Philippine Archipelago is the result of a stupendous\r\nupheaval by volcanic action. [72] At least it seems apparent that\r\nno autochthonous population existed on these lands in their island\r\nform. The first settlers were probably the _Aetas,_ called also\r\n_Negritos_ and _Balugas_, who may have drifted northwards from New\r\nGuinea and have been carried by the strong currents through the\r\nSan Bernadino Straits and round Punta Santiago until they reached\r\nthe still waters in the neighbourhood of Corregidor Island, whilst\r\nothers were carried westwards to the tranquil Sulu Sea, and travelling\r\nthence northwards would have settled on the Island of Negros. It is\r\na fact that for over a century after the Spanish conquest, Negros\r\nIsland had no other inhabitants but these mountaineers and escaped\r\ncriminals from other islands.\r\n\r\nThe sturdy races inhabiting the Central Luzon highlands, decidedly\r\nsuperior in physique and mental capacity to the _Aetas,_ may be of\r\nJapanese origin, for shortly after the conquest by Legaspi a Spanish\r\ngalley cruising off the north coast of Luzon fell in with Japanese,\r\nwho probably penetrated to the interior of that island up the Rio\r\nGrande de Cagayan. Tradition tells us how the Japanese used to sail\r\ndown the east coast of Luzon as far as the neighbourhood of Lamon Bay,\r\nwhere they landed and, descending the little rivers which flowed into\r\nthe Lake of Bay, settled in that region which was called by the first\r\nSpanish conquerors Pagsanjan Province, and which included the Laguna\r\nProvince of to-day, with a portion of the modern Tayabas Province.\r\n\r\nEither the Japanese extended their sphere from the Lake of Bay shore,\r\nor, as some assert (probably erroneously), shipwrecked Japanese went\r\nup the Pansipit River to the Bombon Lake: the fact remains that Taal,\r\nwith the Bombon Lake shore, was a Japanese settlement, and even up to\r\nnow the Taalenos have characteristics differing from those of the pure\r\nMalay immigrant descendants. The Philippine patriot, Dr. Jose Rizal,\r\nwas a good Japanese-Malay type.\r\n\r\nThe Tagalogs, who occupy a small portion of Luzon Island, chiefly\r\nthe provinces of Batangas, Laguna, Rizal, and Bulacan, are believed\r\nto be the cross-breed descendants of these Japanese immigrants. At\r\nthe period of the Spanish conquest the _Tao ilog_, that is to say,\r\n\"the man who came by the river,\" afterwards corrupted into the\r\nmore euphonious name of _Tagalog_, occupied only the lands from the\r\nsouth shore of Laguna de Bay southwards. Some traded with the Malay\r\nsettlers at Maynila (as the city on the Pasig River was then called)\r\nand, little by little, radicated themselves in the Manila suburbs of\r\nQuiapo, Sampaloc, and Santa Cruz. [73]\r\n\r\nFrom the West, long before the Spanish conquest, there was a great\r\ninflux of Malays, who settled on the shores and the lowlands and drove\r\nthe first settlers (_Aetas_) to the mountains. Central Luzon and\r\nthe Lake environs being already occupied, they spread all over the\r\nvacant lands and adjacent islands south of Luzon. These expeditions\r\nfrom Malesia were probably accompanied by Mahometan propagandists,\r\nwho had imparted to the Malays some notions, more or less crude,\r\nof their religion and culture, for at the time of Legaspi's arrival\r\nin Manila we find he had to deal with two chiefs, or petty kings,\r\nboth assuming the Indian title of _Rajah_, whilst one of them had the\r\nMahometan Arabic name of Soliman. Hitherto the _Tao ilog,_ or Tagalog,\r\nhad not descended the Pasig River so far as Manila, and the religious\r\nrites of the Tondo-Manila people must have appeared to Legaspi similar\r\nto the Mahometan rites, [74] for in several of his despatches to his\r\nroyal master he speaks of these people as _Moros_. All the dialects\r\nspoken by the Filipinos of Malay and Japanese descent have their root\r\nin the pure Malay language. After the expulsion of all the adult\r\nmale Japanese Lake settlers in the 17th century, it is feasible to\r\nsuppose that the language of the males who took their place in the\r\nLake district and intermarried there, should prevail over the idiom\r\nof the primitive settlers, and possibly this amalgamation of speech\r\naccounts for the difference between the Tagalog dialect and others\r\nof these islands peopled by Malays.\r\n\r\nThe Malay immigration must have taken place several generations\r\nprior to the coming of the Spaniards, for at that period the lowland\r\noccupants were already divided into peoples speaking different\r\ndialects and distinguishing themselves by groups whose names seem to\r\nbe associated with the districts they inhabited, such as Pampanga,\r\nIloco, and Cagayan; these denominations are probably derived from\r\nsome natural condition, such as _Pampang_, meaning a river embankment,\r\n_Ilog_, a river, _Cauayan_, a bamboo, etc.\r\n\r\nIn a separate chapter (x.) the reputed origin of the Mahometans of\r\nthe southern islands is alluded to. They are also believed to be\r\nimmigrants from the West, and at the time of the conquest recent\r\ntraditions which came to the knowledge of the Spaniards, and were\r\nrecorded by them, prove that commercial relations existed between\r\nBorneo and Manila. There is a tradition [75] also of an attempted\r\nconquest of Luzon by a Borneo chief named Lacasama, about 250 years\r\nbefore the Spanish advent; but apparently the expedition came to\r\ngrief near Luzon, off an island supposed by some to be Masbate.\r\n\r\nThe descendants of the Japanese and Malay immigrants were the people\r\nwhom the Spanish invaders had to subdue to gain a footing. To the\r\npresent day they, and the correlative Chinese and Spanish half-castes,\r\nare the only races, among the several in these Islands, subjected,\r\nin fact, to civilized methods. The expression \"Filipino\" neither\r\ndenotes any autochthonous race, nor any nationality, but simply one\r\nborn in those islands named the Philippines: it is, therefore, open to\r\nargument whether the child of a Filipino, born in a foreign country,\r\ncould be correctly called a Filipino.\r\n\r\nThe christianized Filipinos, enjoying to-day the benefits of European\r\ntraining, are inclined to repudiate, as compatriots, the descendants\r\nof the non-christian tribes, although their concurrent existence,\r\nsince the time of their immigrant forefathers, makes them all equally\r\nFilipinos. Hence many of them who were sent to the St. Louis Exhibition\r\nin 1904 were indignant because the United States Government had chosen\r\nto exhibit some types of uncivilized natives, representing about\r\none-twelfth of the Philippine population. Without these exhibits,\r\nand on seeing only the educated Filipinos who formed the Philippine\r\nCommission, the American people at home might well have asked--Is\r\nnot American civilization a superfluity in those islands?\r\n\r\nThe inhabitants of these Islands were by no means savages, entirely\r\nunreclaimed from barbarism before the Spanish advent in the 16th\r\ncentury. They had a culture of their own, towards which the Malay\r\nsettlers themselves appear to have contributed very little. In the\r\nnascent pre-Spanish civilization, Japanese immigrants were almost\r\nthe only agriculturists, mine-workers, manufacturers, gold-seekers,\r\ngoldsmiths, and masters of the industrial arts in general. Pagsanjan\r\n(Laguna) was their great industrial centre. Malolos (Bulacan) was\r\nalso an important Japanese trading base. Whilst working the mines of\r\nIlocos their exemplary industry must undoubtedly have influenced the\r\ncharacter of the Ilocanos. Away down in the Bicol country of Camarines,\r\nthe Japanese pushed their trade, and from their great settlement in\r\nTaal their traffic must have extended over the whole province, first\r\ncalled by the Spaniards Taal y Balayan, but since named Batangas. From\r\nthe Japanese, the Malays learnt the manufacture of arms, and the\r\nIgorrotes the art of metal-working. Along the coasts of the large\r\ninhabited islands the Chinese travelled as traders or middlemen, at\r\ngreat personal risk of attack by individual robbers, bartering the\r\ngoods of manufacturers for native produce, which chiefly consisted\r\nof sinamay cloth, shark-fin, balate (trepang), edible birds'-nests,\r\ngold in grain, and siguey-shells, for which there was a demand in Siam\r\nfor use as money. Every north-east monsoon brought down the junks\r\nto barter leisurely until the south-west monsoon should waft them\r\nback, and neither Chinese nor Japanese made the least attempt, nor\r\napparently had the least desire, to govern the Islands or to overrule\r\nthe natives. Without coercion, the Malay settlers would appear to\r\nhave unconsciously submitted to the influence of the superior talent\r\nor astuteness of the sedulous races with whom they became merged and\r\nwhose customs they adopted, proof of which can be traced to the present\r\nday. [76] Presumably the busy, industrious immigrants had neither time\r\nnor inclination for sanguinary conflicts, for those recorded appear\r\nto be confined to the raids of the migratory mountaineers and an\r\noccasional attack by some ambitious Borneo buccaneer. The reader who\r\nwould wish to verify these facts is recommended to make a comparative\r\nstudy of native character in Vigan, Malolos, Taal, and Pagsanjan.\r\n\r\nIn treating of the domesticated natives' character, I wish it to be\r\nunderstood that my observations apply solely to the _large majority_\r\nof the six or seven millions of them who inhabit these Islands.\r\n\r\nIn the capital and the ports open to foreign trade, where cosmopolitan\r\nvices and virtues obtain, and in large towns, where there is a constant\r\nnumber of domiciled Europeans and Americans, the native has become\r\na modified being. It is not in such places that a just estimate of\r\ncharacter can be arrived at, even during many years' sojourn. The\r\nnative must be studied by often-repeated casual residence in localities\r\nwhere his, or her, domestication is only \"by law established,\" imposing\r\nlittle restraint upon natural inclinations, and where exotic notions\r\nhave gained no influence.\r\n\r\nSeveral writers have essayed to depict the Philippine native character,\r\nbut with only partial success. Dealing with such an enigma, the most\r\neminent physiognomists would surely differ in their speculations\r\nregarding the Philippine native of the present day. That Catonian\r\nfigure, with placid countenance and solemn gravity of feature, would\r\nreadily deceive any one as to the true mental organism within. The\r\nlate parish priest of Alaminos (Batangas)--a Franciscan friar, who\r\nspent half his life in the Colony--left a brief manuscript essay\r\non the native character. I have read it. In his opinion, the native\r\nis an incomprehensible phenomenon, the mainspring of whose line of\r\nthought and the guiding motive of whose actions have never yet been,\r\nand perhaps never will be, discovered.\r\n\r\nThe reasoning of a native and a European differs so largely that\r\nthe mental impulse of the two races is ever clashing. Sometimes a\r\nnative will serve a master satisfactorily for years, and then suddenly\r\nabscond, or commit some such hideous crime as conniving with a brigand\r\nband to murder the family and pillage the house.\r\n\r\nWhen the hitherto faithful servant is remonstrated with for having\r\ncommitted a crime, he not unfrequently accounts for the fact by saying,\r\n\"_Senor_, my head was hot.\" When caught in the act on his first start\r\non highway robbery or murder, his invariable excuse is that he is\r\nnot a scoundrel himself, but that he was \"invited\" by a relation or\r\n_compadre_ to join the company.\r\n\r\nHe is fond of gambling, profligate, lavish in his promises, but _lache_\r\nin the extreme as to their fulfilment. He will never come frankly and\r\nopenly forward to make a clean breast of a fault committed, or even a\r\npardonable accident, but will hide it, until it is found out. In common\r\nwith many other non-European races, an act of generosity or a voluntary\r\nconcession of justice is regarded as a sign of weakness. Hence it\r\nis that the experienced European is often compelled to be more harsh\r\nthan his real nature dictates.\r\n\r\nIf one pays a native 20 cents for a service performed, and that be\r\nexactly the customary remuneration, he will say nothing, but if a\r\nfeeling of compassion impels one to pay 30 cents, the recipient will\r\nloudly protest that he ought to be paid more. [77] In Luzon the native\r\nis able to say \"Thank you\" (_salamat-po_) in his mother-tongue, but\r\nin Panay and Negros there is no way of expressing thanks in native\r\ndialect to a donor (the nearest approach to it is _Dios macbayat_);\r\nand although this may, at first sight, appear to be an insignificant\r\nfact, I think, nevertheless, a great deal may be deduced from it,\r\nfor the deficiency of the word in the Visaya vernacular denotes a\r\ndeficiency of the idea which that word should express.\r\n\r\nIf the native be in want of a trivial thing, which by plain asking he\r\ncould readily obtain, he will come with a long tale, often begin by\r\ntelling a lie, and whilst he invariably scratches his head, he will\r\nbeat about the bush until he comes to the point, with a supplicating\r\ntone and a saintly countenance hiding a mass of falsity. But if\r\nhe has nothing to gain for himself, his reticence is astonishingly\r\ninconvenient, for he may let one's horse die and tell one afterwards\r\nit was for want of rice-paddy, or, just at the very moment one wants\r\nto use something, he will tell one \"_Uala-po_\"--there is not any.\r\n\r\nI have known natives whose mothers, according to their statement,\r\nhave died several times, and each time they have tried to beg the loan\r\nof the burial expenses. The mother of my first servant died twice,\r\naccording to his account.\r\n\r\nEven the best class of natives do not appreciate, or feel grateful\r\nfor, or even seem to understand a spontaneous gift. Apparently,\r\nthey only comprehend the favour when one yields to their asking. The\r\nlowest classes never give to each other, unsolicited, a cent's worth,\r\noutside the customary reciprocal feast-offerings. If a European makes\r\n_voluntary_ gratuities to the natives, he is considered a fool--they\r\nentertain a contempt for him, which develops into intolerable\r\nimpertinence. If the native comes to borrow, lend him a little less\r\nthan he asks for, after a verbose preamble; if one at once lent, or\r\ngave, the full value requested, he would continue to invent a host of\r\npressing necessities, until one's patience was exhausted. He seldom\r\nrestores the loan of anything voluntarily. On being remonstrated with\r\nfor his remissness, after the date of repayment or return of the\r\narticle has expired, he will coolly reply, \"You did not ask me for\r\nit.\" An amusing case of native reasoning came within my experience\r\njust recently. I lent some articles to an educated Filipino, who had\r\nfrequently been my guest, and, at the end of three months, I requested\r\ntheir return. Instead of thanking me for their use, he wrote a letter\r\nexpressing his indignation at my reminder, saying that I \"ought to know\r\nthey were in very good hands!\" A native considers it no degradation\r\nto borrow money: it gives him no recurrent feeling of humiliation or\r\ndistress of mind. Thus, he will often give a costly feast to impress\r\nhis neighbours with his wealth and maintain his local prestige, whilst\r\non all sides he has debts innumerable. At most, with his looseness\r\nof morality, he regards debt as an inconvenience, not as a calamity.\r\n\r\nBefore entering another (middle- or lower-class) native's house, he\r\nis very complimentary, and sometimes three minutes' polite excusatory\r\ndialogue is exchanged between the visitor and the native visited\r\nbefore the former passes the threshold. When the same class of native\r\nenters a European's house, he generally satisfies his curiosity by\r\nlooking all around, and often pokes his head into a private room,\r\nasking permission to enter afterwards.\r\n\r\nThe lower-class native never comes at first call; among themselves it\r\nis usual to call five or six times, raising the voice each time. If\r\na native is told to tell another to come, he seldom goes to him to\r\ndeliver the message, but calls him from a distance. When a native\r\nsteals (and I must say they are fairly honest), he steals only what he\r\nwants. One of the rudest acts, according to their social code, is to\r\nstep over a person asleep on the floor. Sleeping is, with them, a very\r\nsolemn matter; they are very averse to waking any one, the idea being,\r\nthat during sleep the soul is absent from the body, and that if slumber\r\nbe suddenly arrested the soul might not have time to return. When a\r\nperson, knowing the habits of the native, calls upon him and is told\r\n\"He is asleep,\" he does not inquire further--the rest is understood:\r\nthat he may have to wait an indefinite time until the sleeper wakes\r\nup--so he may as well depart. To urge a servant to rouse one, one has\r\nto give him very imperative orders to that effect: then he stands\r\nby one's side and calls \"Senor, senor!\" repeatedly, and each time\r\nlouder, until one is half awake; then he returns to the low note,\r\nand gradually raises his voice again until one is quite conscious.\r\n\r\nIn Spanish times, wherever I went in the whole Archipelago--near the\r\ncapital, or 500 miles from it--I found mothers teaching their offspring\r\nto regard the European as a demoniacal being, an evil spirit, or,\r\nat least, as an enemy to be feared! If a child cried, it was hushed\r\nby the exclamation, \"Castila!\" (European). If a white man approached\r\na poor hut or a fine native residence, the cry of caution, the\r\nwatchword for defence was always heard--\"Castila!\"--and the children\r\nhastened their retreat from the dreaded object. But this is now a\r\nthing of the past since the native crossed swords with the \"Castila\"\r\n(q.v.) and the American on the battle-field, and, rightly or wrongly,\r\nthoroughly believes himself to be a match for either in equal numbers.\r\n\r\nThe Filipino, like most Orientals, is a good imitator, but having no\r\ninitiative genius, he is not efficient in anything. He will copy a\r\nmodel any number of times, but one cannot get him to make two copies\r\nso much alike that the one is undistinguishable from the other. Yet\r\nhe has no attachment for any occupation in particular. To-day he will\r\nbe at the plough; to-morrow a coachman, a collector of accounts,\r\na valet, a sailor, and so on; or he will suddenly renounce social\r\ntrammels in pursuit of lawless vagabondage. I once travelled with a\r\nColonel Marques, acting-Governor of Cebu, whose valet was an ex-law\r\nstudent. Still, many are willing to learn, and really become very\r\nexpert artisans, especially machinists.\r\n\r\nThe native is indolent in the extreme, and never tires of sitting\r\nstill, gazing at nothing in particular. He will do no regular work\r\nwithout an advance; his word cannot be depended upon; he is fertile\r\nin exculpatory devices; he is momentarily obedient, but is averse\r\nto subjection. He feigns friendship, but has no loyalty; he is calm\r\nand silent, but can keep no secret; he is daring on the spur of\r\nthe moment, but fails in resolution if he reflects. He is wantonly\r\nunfeeling towards animals; cruel to a fallen foe; tyrannical over\r\nhis own people when in power; rarely tempers his animosities with\r\ncompassion or pity, but is devotedly fond of his children. He is\r\nshifty, erratic, void of chivalrous feeling; and if familiarity be\r\npermitted with the common-class native, he is liable to presume upon\r\nit. The Tagalog is docile and pliant, but keenly resents an injustice.\r\n\r\nNative superstition and facile credulity are easily imposed upon. A\r\nreport emitted in jest, or in earnest, travels with alarming rapidity,\r\nand the consequences have not unfrequently been serious. The native\r\nrarely sees a joke, and still more rarely makes one. He never reveals\r\nanger, but he will, with the most profound calmness, avenge himself,\r\nawaiting patiently the opportunity to use his bowie-knife with\r\neffect. Mutilation of a vanquished enemy is common among these\r\nIslanders. If a native recognizes a fault by his own conscience,\r\nhe will receive a flogging without resentment or complaint; if he\r\nis not so convinced of the misdeed, he will await his chance to give\r\nvent to his rancour.\r\n\r\nHe has a profound respect only for the elders of his household, and\r\nthe lash justly administered. He rarely refers to past generations\r\nin his lineage, and the lowest class do not know their own ages. The\r\nFilipino, of any class, has no memory for dates. In 1904 not one in\r\na hundred remembered the month and year in which General Aguinaldo\r\nsurrendered. During the Independence war, an esteemed friend of mine,\r\na Philippine priest, died, presumably of old age. I went to his town\r\nto inquire all about it from his son, but neither the son nor another\r\nnear relation could recollect, after two days' reflection, even the\r\nyear the old man passed away. Another friend of mine had his brains\r\nblown out during the Revolution. His brother was anxious to relate\r\nthe tragedy to me and how he had lost 20,000 pesos in consequence,\r\nbut he could not tell me in which month it happened. Families are\r\nvery united, and claims for help and protection are admitted however\r\ndistant the relationship may be. Sometimes the connection of a\r\n\"hanger-on\" with his host's family will be so remote and doubtful,\r\nthat he can only be recognized as \"_un poco pariente nada mas_\"\r\n(a sort of kinsman). But the house is open to all.\r\n\r\nThe native is a good father and a good husband, unreasonably jealous of\r\nhis wife, careless of the honour of his daughter, and will take no heed\r\nof the indiscretions of his spouse committed before marriage. Cases\r\nhave been known of natives having fled from their burning huts,\r\ntaking care to save their fighting-cocks, but leaving their wives\r\nand children to look after themselves.\r\n\r\nIf a question be suddenly put to a native, he apparently loses his\r\npresence of mind, and gives the reply most convenient to save himself\r\nfrom trouble, punishment, or reproach. It is a matter of perfect\r\nindifference to him whether the reply be true or not. Then, as the\r\ninvestigation proceeds, he will amend one statement after another,\r\nuntil, finally, he has practically admitted his first explanation\r\nto be quite false. One who knows the native character, so far as its\r\nmysteries are penetrable, would never attempt to get at the truth of\r\na question by a direct inquiry--he would \"beat about the bush,\" and\r\nextract the truth bit by bit. Nor do the natives, rich or poor, of any\r\nclass in life, and with very few exceptions in the whole population,\r\nappear to regard lying as a sin, but rather as a legitimate, though\r\ncunning, convenience, which should be resorted to whenever it will\r\nserve a purpose. It is my frank opinion that they do not, in their\r\nconsciences, hold lying to be a fault in any degree. If the liar be\r\ndiscovered and faced, he rarely appears disconcerted--his countenance\r\nrather denotes surprise at the discovery, or disappointment at his\r\nbeing foiled in the object for which he lied. As this is one of the\r\nmost remarkable characteristics of the Filipino of both sexes in all\r\nspheres of life, I have repeatedly discussed it with the priests,\r\nseveral of whom have assured me that the habit prevails even in the\r\nconfessional. [78] In the administration of justice this circumstance\r\nis inconvenient, because a witness is always procurable for a few\r\npesos. In a law-case, in which one or both parties belong to the\r\nlowest class, it is sometimes difficult to say whether the false or\r\nthe true witnesses are in majority.\r\n\r\nMen and women alike find exaggerated enjoyment in litigation, which\r\nmany keep up for years. Among themselves they are tyrannical. They have\r\nno real sentiment, nor do they practise virtue for virtue's sake, and,\r\napart from their hospitality, in which they (especially the Tagalogs)\r\nfar excel the European, all their actions appear to be only guided\r\nby fear, or interest, or both.\r\n\r\nThe domesticated Tagalogs of Luzon have made greater progress\r\nin civilization and good manners than the Visayos of Panay and\r\nNegros. The Tagalog differs vastly from his southern brother in\r\nhis true nature, which is more pliant, whilst he is by instinct\r\ncheerfully and disinterestedly hospitable. Invariably a European\r\nwayfarer in a Tagalog village is invited by one or another of the\r\nprincipal residents to lodge at his house as a free guest, for to\r\noffer payment would give offence. A present of some European article\r\nmight be made, but it is not at all looked for. The Tagalog host\r\nlends his guest horses or vehicles to go about the neighbourhood,\r\ntakes him round to the houses of his friends, accompanies him to any\r\nfeast which may be celebrated at the time of his visit, and lends\r\nhim his sporting-gun, if he has one. The whole time he treats him\r\nwith the deference due to the superiority which he recognizes. He is\r\nremarkably inquisitive, and will ask all sorts of questions about\r\none's private affairs, but that is of no consequence--he is not\r\nintrusive, and if he be invited to return the visit in the capital,\r\nor wherever one may reside, he accepts the invitation reluctantly,\r\nbut seldom pays the visit. Speaking of the Tagalog as a host, pure\r\nand simple, he is generally the most genial man one could hope to meet.\r\n\r\nThe Negros and Panay Visayo's cold hospitality is much tempered with\r\nthe prospect of personal gain--quite a contrast to the Tagalog. On\r\nthe first visit he might admit the white traveller into his house\r\nout of mere curiosity to know all about him--whence he comes--why he\r\ntravels--how much he possesses--and where he is going. The basis of\r\nhis estimation of a visitor is his worldly means; or, if the visitor\r\nbe engaged in trade, his power to facilitate his host's schemes would\r\nbring him a certain measure of civility and complaisance. He is fond\r\nof, and seeks the patronage of Europeans of position. In manners, the\r\nNegros and Panay Visayo is uncouth and brusque, and more conceited,\r\narrogant, self-reliant, ostentatious, and unpolished than his northern\r\nneighbour. If remonstrated with for any fault, he is quite disposed\r\nto assume a tone of impertinent retort or sullen defiance. The Cebuano\r\nis more congenial and hospitable.\r\n\r\nThe women, too, are less affable in Panay and Negros, and evince an\r\nalmost incredible avarice. They are excessively fond of ornament,\r\nand at feasts they appear adorned with an amount of gaudy French\r\njewellery which, compared with their means, cost them a lot of money\r\nto purchase from the swarm of Jew pedlars who, before the Revolution\r\nof 1896, periodically invaded the villages.\r\n\r\nIf a European calls on a well-to-do Negros or Panay Visayo, the\r\nwomen of the family saunter off in one direction or another, to\r\nhide themselves in other rooms, unless the visitor be well known to\r\nthe family. If met by chance, perhaps they will return a salutation,\r\nperhaps not. They seldom indulge in a smile before a stranger; have no\r\nconversation; no tuition beyond music and the lives of the Saints, and\r\naltogether impress the traveller with their insipidity of character,\r\nwhich chimes badly with their manifest air of disdain.\r\n\r\nThe women of Luzon (and in a slightly less degree the Cebuanas)\r\nare more frank, better educated, and decidedly more courteous and\r\nsociable. Their manners are comparatively lively, void of arrogance,\r\ncheerful, and buoyant in tone. However, all over the Islands the\r\nwomen are more parsimonious than the men; but, as a rule, they\r\nare more clever and discerning than the other sex, over whom they\r\nexercise great influence. Many of them are very dexterous business\r\nwomen and have made the fortunes of their families. A notable example\r\nof this was the late Dona Cornelia Laochanco, of Manila, with whom\r\nI was personally acquainted, and who, by her own talent in trading\r\ntransactions, accumulated considerable wealth. Dona Cornelia (who died\r\nin 1899) was the foundress of the system of blending sugar to sample\r\nfor export, known in Manila as the _farderia._ In her establishment\r\nat San Miguel she had a little tower erected, whence a watchman\r\nkept his eye on the weather. When threatening clouds appeared a bell\r\nwas tolled and the mats were instantly picked up and carried off by\r\nher Chinese coolie staff, which she managed with great skill, due,\r\nperhaps, to the fact that her three husbands were Chinese.\r\n\r\nThe Philippine woman makes an excellent general servant in native\r\nfamilies; in the same capacity, in European service, she is, as a rule,\r\nalmost useless, but she is a good nursemaid.\r\n\r\nThe Filipino has many excellent qualities which go far to make\r\namends for his shortcomings. He is patient and forbearing in the\r\nextreme, remarkably sober, plodding, anxious only about providing\r\nfor his immediate wants, and seldom feels \"the canker of ambitious\r\nthoughts.\" In his person and his dwelling he may serve as a pattern\r\nof cleanliness to all other races in the tropical East. He has little\r\nthought beyond the morrow, and therefore never racks his brains about\r\nevents of the far future in the political world, the world to come,\r\nor any other sphere. He indifferently leaves everything to happen as\r\nit may, with surprising resignation. The native, in general, will go\r\nwithout food for many hours at a time without grumbling; and fish,\r\nrice, betel-nut, and tobacco are his chief wants. Inebriety is almost\r\nunknown, although strong drink (nipa wine) is plentiful.\r\n\r\nIn common with other races whose lives are almost exclusively passed\r\namid the ever-varying wonders of land and sea, Filipinos rarely express\r\nany spontaneous admiration for the beauties of Nature, and seem little\r\nsensible to any aspect thereof not directly associated with the human\r\ninterest of their calling. Few Asiatics, indeed, go into raptures\r\nover lovely scenery as Europeans do, nor does \"the gorgeous glamour\r\nof the Orient\" which we speak of so ecstatically strike them as such.\r\n\r\nWhen a European is travelling, he never needs to trouble about where\r\nor when his servant gets his food or where he sleeps--he looks after\r\nthat. When a native travels, he drops in amongst any group of his\r\nfellow-countrymen whom he finds having their meal on the roadside,\r\nand wherever he happens to be at nightfall, there he lies down to\r\nsleep. He is never long in a great dilemma. If his hut is about to\r\nfall, he makes it fast with bamboo and rattan-cane. If a vehicle breaks\r\ndown, a harness snaps, or his canoe leaks or upsets, he always has his\r\nremedy at hand. He stoically bears misfortune of all kinds with the\r\ngreatest indifference, and without the least apparent emotion. Under\r\nthe eye of his master he is the most tractable of all beings. He never\r\n(like the Chinese) insists upon doing things his own way, but tries to\r\ndo just as he is told, whether it be right or wrong. A native enters\r\none's service as a coachman, but if he be told to paddle a boat, cook a\r\nmeal, fix a lock, or do any other kind of labour possible to him, he is\r\nquite agreeable. He knows the duties of no occupation with efficiency,\r\nand he is perfectly willing to be a \"jack-of-all-trades.\" Another good\r\nfeature is that he rarely, if ever, repudiates a debt, although he may\r\nnever pay it. So long as he gets his food and fair treatment, and his\r\nstipulated wages in advance, he is content to act as a general-utility\r\nman; lodging he will find for himself. If not pressed too hard, he will\r\nfollow his superior like a faithful dog. If treated with kindness,\r\naccording to _European_ notions, he is lost. The native never looks\r\nahead; if left to himself, he will do all sorts of imprudent things,\r\nfrom sheer want of reflection on the consequences, when, as he puts it,\r\n\"his head is hot\" from excitement due to any cause.\r\n\r\nOn March 15, 1886, I was coming round the coast of Zambales in a small\r\nsteamer, in which I was the only saloon passenger. The captain, whom\r\nI had known for years, found that one of the cabin servants had been\r\nsystematically pilfering for some time past. He ordered the steward\r\nto cane him, and then told him to go to the upper deck and remain\r\nthere. He at once walked up the ladder and threw himself into the sea;\r\nbut the vessel stopped, a boat was lowered, and he was soon picked\r\nup. Had he been allowed to reach the shore, he would have become\r\nwhat is known as a _remontado_ and perhaps eventually a brigand,\r\nfor such is the beginning of many of them.\r\n\r\nThe thorough-bred native has no idea of organization on a large\r\nscale, hence a successful revolution is not possible if confined to\r\nhis own class unaided by others, such as Creoles and foreigners. He\r\nis brave, and fears no consequences when with or against his equals,\r\nor if led by his superiors; but a conviction of superiority--moral\r\nor physical--in the adversary depresses him. An excess of audacity\r\ncalms and overawes him rather than irritates him.\r\n\r\nHis admiration for bravery and perilous boldness is only equalled\r\nby his contempt for cowardice and puerility, and this is really\r\nthe secret of the native's disdain for the Chinese race. Under good\r\nEuropean officers he makes an excellent soldier, and would follow\r\na brave leader to death; however, if the leader fell, he would at\r\nonce become demoralized. There is nothing he delights in more than\r\npillage, destruction, and bloodshed, and when once he becomes master\r\nof the situation in an affray, there is no limit to his greed and\r\nsavage cruelty.\r\n\r\nYet, detesting order of any kind, military discipline is repugnant\r\nto him, and, as in other countries where conscription is the law,\r\nall kinds of tricks are resorted to to avoid it. On looking over the\r\ndeeds of an estate which I had purchased, I saw that two brothers,\r\neach named Catalino Raymundo, were the owners at one time of a portion\r\nof the land. I thought there must have been some mistake, but, on\r\nclose inquiry, I found that they were so named to dodge the Spanish\r\nrecruiting officers, who would not readily suppose there were two\r\nCatalino Raymundos born of the same parents. As one Catalino Raymundo\r\nhad served in the army and the other was dead, no further secret was\r\nmade in the matter, and I was assured that this practice was common\r\namong the poorest natives.\r\n\r\nIn November, 1887, a deserter from the new recruits was pursued\r\nto Langca, a ward of Meycauayan, Bulacan Province, where nearly\r\nall the inhabitants rose up in his defence, the result being that\r\nthe Lieutenant of Cuadrilleros was killed and two of his men were\r\nwounded. When the Civil Guard appeared on the spot, the whole ward\r\nwas abandoned.\r\n\r\nAccording to the Spanish army regulations, a soldier cannot\r\nbe on sentinel duty for more than two hours at a time under any\r\ncircumstances. Cases have been known of a native sentinel having been\r\nleft at his post for a little over that regulation time, and to have\r\nbecome phrenetic, under the impression that the two hours had long\r\nsince expired, and that he had been forgotten. In one case the man\r\nhad to be disarmed by force, but in another instance the sentinel\r\nsimply refused to give up his rifle and bayonet, and defied all who\r\napproached him. Finally, an officer went with the colours of the\r\nregiment in hand to exhort him to surrender his arms, adding that\r\njustice would attend his complaint. The sentinel, however, threatened\r\nto kill any one who should draw near, and the officer had no other\r\nrecourse open to him but to order a European soldier to climb up\r\nbehind the sentry-box and blow out the insubordinate native's brains.\r\n\r\nIn the seventies, a contingent of Philippine troops was sent to\r\nassist the French in Tonquin, where they rendered very valuable\r\nservice. Indeed, some officers are of opinion that they did more to\r\nquell the Tuh Duc rising than the French troops themselves. When in\r\nthe fray, they throw off their boots, and, barefooted, they rarely\r\nfalter. Even over mud and swamp, a native is almost as sure-footed\r\nas a goat on the brink of a quarry. I have frequently been carried\r\nfor miles in a hammock by four natives and relays, through morassy\r\ndistricts too dangerous to travel on horseback. They are great adepts\r\nat climbing wherever it is possible for a human being to scale a\r\nheight; like monkeys, they hold as much with their feet as with their\r\nhands; they ride any horse barebacked without fear; they are utterly\r\ncareless about jumping into the sea among the sharks, which sometimes\r\nthey will intentionally attack with knives, and I never knew a native\r\nwho could not swim. There are natives who dare dive for the caiman and\r\nrip it up. If they meet with an accident, they bear it with supreme\r\nresignation, simply exclaiming \"_desgracia pa_\"--it was a misfortune.\r\n\r\nI can record with pleasure my happy recollection of many a\r\nlight-hearted, genial, and patient native who accompanied me on\r\nmy journeys in these Islands. Comparatively very few thorough-bred\r\nnatives travel beyond their own islands, although there is a constant\r\nflow of half-castes to and from the adjacent colonies, Europe, etc.\r\n\r\nThe native is very slowly tempted to abandon the habits and traditional\r\ncustoms of his forefathers, and his ambitionless felicity may be\r\nenvied by any true philosopher.\r\n\r\nNo one who has lived in the Colony for years could sketch the\r\nreal moral portrait of such a remarkable combination of virtues\r\nand vices. The domesticated native's character is a succession of\r\nsurprises. The experience of each year modifies one's conclusions,\r\nand the most exact definition of such an inscrutable being is, after\r\nall, hypothetical. However, to a certain degree, the characteristic\r\nindolence of these Islanders is less dependent on themselves\r\nthan on natural law, for the physical conditions surrounding them\r\nundoubtedly tend to arrest their vigour of motion, energy of life,\r\nand intellectual power.\r\n\r\nThe organic elements of the European differ widely from those of the\r\nPhilippine native, and each, for his own durability, requires his own\r\nspecial environment. The half-breed partakes of both organisms, but has\r\nthe natural environment of the one. Sometimes artificial means--the\r\nmode of life into which he is forced by his European parent--will\r\ncounteract in a measure natural law, but, left to himself, the tendency\r\nwill ever be towards an assimilation to the native. Original national\r\ncharacteristics disappear in an exotic climate, and, in the course\r\nof time, conform to the new laws of nature to which they are exposed.\r\n\r\nIt is an ascertained fact that the increase of energy introduced into\r\nthe Philippine native by blood mixture from Europe lasts only to the\r\nsecond generation, whilst the effect remains for several generations\r\nwhen there is a similarity of natural surroundings in the two races\r\ncrossed. Moreover, the peculiar physique of a Chinese or Japanese\r\nprogenitor is preserved in succeeding generations, long after the\r\nSpanish descendant has merged into the conditions of his environment.\r\n\r\nThe Spanish Government strove in vain against natural law to\r\ncounteract physical conditions by favouring mixed marriages, [79]\r\nbut Nature overcomes man's law, and climatic influence forces its\r\nconditions on the half-breed. Indeed, were it not for new supplies of\r\nextraneous blood infusion, European characteristics would, in time,\r\nbecome indiscernible among the masses. Even on Europeans themselves,\r\nin defiance of their own volition, the new physical conditions and\r\nthe influence of climate on their mental and physical organisms\r\nare perceptible after two or three decades of years' residence in\r\nthe mid-tropics.\r\n\r\nAll the natives of the domesticated type have distinct Malay, or\r\nMalay-Japanese, or Mongol features--prominent cheek-bones, large\r\nand lively eyes, and flat noses with dilated nostrils. They are,\r\non the average, of rather low stature, very rarely bearded, and of a\r\ncopper colour more or less dark. Most of the women have no distinct\r\nline of hair on the forehead. Some there are with a frontal hairy\r\ndown extending to within an inch of the eyes, possibly a reversion\r\nto a progenitor (the _Macacus radiata_) in whom the forehead had\r\nnot become quite naked, leaving the limit between the scalp and the\r\nforehead undefined. The hair of both males and females stands out from\r\nthe skin like bristles, and is very coarse. The coarseness of the\r\nfemale's hair is, however, more than compensated by its luxuriance;\r\nfor, provided she be in a normal state of health, up to the prime of\r\nlife the hair commonly reaches down to the waist, and occasionally\r\nto the ankles. The women are naturally proud of this mark of beauty,\r\nwhich they preserved by frequent washings with _gogo_ (q.v.) and the\r\nuse of cocoanut oil (q.v.). Hare-lip is common. Children, from their\r\nbirth, have a spot at the base of the vertebrae, thereby supporting the\r\ntheory of Professor Huxley's _Anthropidae_ sub-order--or man (_vide_\r\nProfessor Huxley's \"An Introduction to the Classification of Animals,\"\r\np. 99. Published 1869).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMarriages between natives are usually arranged by the parents of\r\nthe respective families. The nubile age of females is from about\r\n11 years. The parents of the young man visit those of the maiden, to\r\napproach the subject delicately in an oratorical style of allegory. The\r\nresponse is in like manner shrouded with mystery, and the veil is only\r\nthrown off the negotiations when it becomes evident that both parties\r\nagree. Among the poorer classes, if the young man has no goods to\r\noffer, it is frequently stipulated that he shall serve on probation\r\nfor an indefinite period in the house of his future bride,--as Jacob\r\nserved Laban to make Rachel his wife,--and not a few drudge for years\r\nwith this hope before them.\r\n\r\nSometimes, in order to secure service gratis, the elders of the\r\nyoung woman will suddenly dismiss the young man after a prolonged\r\nexpectation, and take another _Catipad_. as he is called, on the\r\nsame terms. The old colonial legislation--\"Leyes de Indias\"--in vain\r\nprohibited this barbarous ancient custom, and there was a modern\r\nSpanish law (of which few availed themselves) which permitted the\r\nintended bride to be \"deposited\" away from parental custody, whilst\r\nthe parents were called upon to show cause why the union should not\r\ntake place. However, it often happens that when Cupid has already\r\nshot his arrow into the virginal breast, and the betrothed foresee\r\na determined opposition to their mutual hopes, they anticipate the\r\nprivileges of matrimony, and compel the bride's parents to countenance\r\ntheir legitimate aspirations to save the honour of the family. _Honi\r\nsoit qui mal y pense_--they simply force the hand of a dictatorial\r\nmother-in-law. The women are notably mercenary, and if, on the part\r\nof the girl and her people, there be a hitch, it is generally on\r\nthe question of dollars when both parties are native. Of course,\r\nif the suitor be European, no such question is raised--the ambition\r\nof the family and the vanity of the girl being both satisfied by the\r\nalliance itself.\r\n\r\nWhen the proposed espousals are accepted, the donations _propter\r\nnuptias_ are paid by the father of the bridegroom to defray the\r\nwedding expenses, and often a dowry settlement, called in Tagalog\r\ndialect \"_bigaycaya_\" is made in favour of the bride. Very rarely\r\nthe bride's property is settled on the husband. I never heard of such\r\na case. The Spanish laws relating to married persons' property were\r\nquaint. If the husband were poor and the wife well-off, so they might\r\nremain, notwithstanding the marriage. He, as a rule, became a simple\r\nadministrator of her possessions, and, if honest, often depended on\r\nher liberality to supply his own necessities. If he became bankrupt\r\nin a business in which he employed also her capital or possessions,\r\nshe ranked as a creditor of the second class under the \"Commercial\r\nCode.\" If she died, the poor husband, under no circumstances, by legal\r\nright (unless under a deed signed before a notary) derived any benefit\r\nfrom the fact of his having espoused a rich wife: her property passed\r\nto their legitimate issue, or--in default thereof--to her nearest blood\r\nrelation. The children might be rich, and, but for their generosity,\r\ntheir father might be destitute, whilst the law compelled him to\r\nrender a strict account to them of the administration of their property\r\nduring their minority. This fact has given rise to many lawsuits.\r\n\r\nA married woman often signs her maiden name, sometimes adding \"_de_\r\n----\" (her husband's surname). If she survives him, she again takes\r\nup her _nomen ante nuptias_ amongst her old circle of friends,\r\nand only adds \"widow of ----\" to show who she is to the public (if\r\nshe be in trade), or to those who have only known her as a married\r\nwoman. The offspring use both the parental surnames, the mother's\r\ncoming after the father's; hence it is the more prominent. Frequently,\r\nin Spanish documents requiring the mention of a person's name in full,\r\nthe mother's maiden surname is revived.\r\n\r\nThus marriage, as I understand the spirit of the Spanish law, seems\r\nto be a simple contract to legitimize and license procreation.\r\n\r\nUp to the year 1844, only a minority of the christian natives had\r\ndistinctive family names. They were, before that date, known by certain\r\nharsh ejaculations, and classification of families was uncared for\r\namong the majority of the population. Therefore, in that year, a list\r\nof Spanish surnames was sent to each parish priest, and every native\r\nfamily had to adopt a separate appellation, which has ever since\r\nbeen perpetuated. Hence one meets natives bearing illustrious names\r\nsuch as Juan Salcedo, Juan de Austria, Rianzares, Ramon de Cabrera,\r\nPio Nono Lopez, and a great many Legaspis.\r\n\r\nWhen a wedding among natives was determined upon, the betrothed went\r\nto the priest--not necessarily together--kissed his hand, and informed\r\nhim of their intention. There was a tariff of marriage fees, but the\r\npriest usually set this aside, and fixed his charges according to the\r\nresources of the parties. This abuse of power could hardly be resisted,\r\nas the natives have a radicate aversion to being married elsewhere than\r\nin the village of the bride. The priest, too (not the bride), usually\r\nhad the privilege of \"naming the day.\" The fees demanded were sometimes\r\nenormous, the common result being that many couples merely cohabited\r\nunder mutual vows because they could not pay the wedding expenses.\r\n\r\nThe banns were verbally published after the benediction following\r\nthe conclusion of the Mass. In the evening, prior to the marriage,\r\nit was compulsory on the couple to confess and obtain absolution from\r\nthe priest. The nuptials almost invariably took place after the first\r\nMass, between five and six in the morning, and those couples who were\r\nspiritually prepared first presented themselves for Communion. Then an\r\nacolyte placed over the shoulders of the bridal pair a thick mantle\r\nor pall. The priest recited a short formula of about five minutes'\r\nduration, put his interrogations, received the muttered responses, and\r\nall was over. To the espoused, as they left the church, was tendered\r\na bowl of coin; the bridegroom passed a handful of the contents to\r\nthe bride, who accepted it and returned it to the bowl. This act was\r\nsymbolical of his giving to her his worldly goods. Then they left the\r\nchurch with their friends, preserving that solemn, stoical countenance\r\ncommon to all Malay natives. There was no visible sign of emotion\r\nas they all walked off, with the most matter-of-fact indifference,\r\nto the paternal abode. This was the custom under the Spaniards,\r\nand it still largely obtains; the Revolution decreed civil marriage,\r\nwhich the Americans have declared lawful, but not compulsory.\r\n\r\nAfter the marriage ceremony the feast called the _Catapusan_ [80]\r\nbegins. To this the vicar and headmen of the villages, the immediate\r\nfriends and relatives of the allied families, and any Europeans who\r\nmay happen to be resident or sojourning, are invited. The table is\r\nspread, _a la Russe_, with all the good things procurable served at\r\nthe same time--sweetmeats predominating. Imported beer, Dutch gin,\r\nchocolate, etc., are also in abundance. After the early repast, both\r\nmen and women are constantly being offered betel-nut to masticate,\r\nand cigars or cigarettes, according to choice.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, the company is entertained by native dancers. Two at\r\na time--a young man and woman--stand _vis-a-vis_ and alternately\r\nsing a love ditty, the burthen of the theme usually opening by\r\nthe regret of the young man that his amorous overtures have been\r\ndisregarded. Explanations follow, in the poetic dialogue, as the\r\nparties dance around each other, keeping a slow step to the plaintive\r\nstrains of music. This is called the _Balitao_. It is most popular\r\nin Visayas.\r\n\r\nAnother dance is performed by a young woman only. If well executed\r\nit is extremely graceful. The girl begins singing a few words in an\r\nordinary tone, when her voice gradually drops to the _diminuendo_,\r\nwhilst her slow gesticulations and the declining vigour of the music\r\ntogether express her forlornness. Then a ray of joy seems momentarily\r\nto lighten her mental anguish; the spirited _crescendo_ notes gently\r\nreturn; the tone of the melody swells; her measured step and action\r\nenergetically quicken--until she lapses again into resigned sorrow,\r\nand so on alternately. Coy in repulse, and languid in surrender,\r\nthe _danseuse_ in the end forsakes her sentiment of melancholy for\r\nelated passion.\r\n\r\nThe native dances are numerous. Another of the most typical, is that\r\nof a girl writhing and dancing a _pas seul_ with a glass of water on\r\nher head. This is known as the _Comitan_.\r\n\r\nWhen Europeans are present, the bride usually retires into the\r\nkitchen or a back room, and only puts in an appearance after repeated\r\nrequests. The conversation rarely turns upon the event of the meeting;\r\nthere is not the slightest outward manifestation of affection between\r\nthe newly-united couple, who, during the feast, are only seen together\r\nby mere accident. If there are European guests, the repast is served\r\nthree times--firstly for the Europeans and headmen, secondly for\r\nthe males of less social dignity, and lastly for the women. Neither\r\nat the table nor in the reception-room do the men and women mingle,\r\nexcept for perhaps the first quarter of an hour after the arrival,\r\nor whilst dancing continues.\r\n\r\nAbout an hour after the mid-day meal, those who are not lodging at the\r\nhouse return to their respective residences to sleep the _siesta_. On\r\nan occasion like this--at a _Catapusan_ given for any reason--native\r\noutsiders, from anywhere, always invade the kitchen in a mob, lounge\r\naround doorways, fill up corners, and drop in for the feast uninvited,\r\nand it is usual to be liberally complaisant to all comers.\r\n\r\nAs a rule, the married couple live with the parents of one or the\r\nother, at least until the family inconveniently increases. In old\r\nage, the elder members of the families come under the protection\r\nof the younger ones quite as a matter of course. In any case, a\r\nnewly-married pair seldom reside alone. Relations from all parts\r\nflock in. Cousins, uncles and aunts, of more or less distant grade,\r\nhang on to the recently-established household, if it be not extremely\r\npoor. Even when a European marries a native woman, she is certain to\r\nintroduce some vagabond relation--a drone to hive with the bees--a\r\ncondition quite inevitable, unless the husband be a man of specially\r\ndetermined character.\r\n\r\nDeath at childbirth is very common, and it is said that 25 per cent. of\r\nthe new-born children die within a month.\r\n\r\nAmong the lowest classes, whilst a woman is lying-in, the husband\r\ncloses all the windows to prevent the evil spirit (_asuan_) entering;\r\nsometimes he will wave about a stick or bowie-knife at the door, or on\r\ntop of the roof, for the same purpose. Even among the most enlightened,\r\nat the present day, the custom of shutting the windows is inherited\r\nfrom their superstitious forefathers, probably in ignorance of the\r\norigin of this usage.\r\n\r\nIn Spanish times it was considered rather an honour than otherwise\r\nto have children by a priest, and little secret was made of it.\r\n\r\nIn October, 1888, I was in a village near Manila, at the bedside\r\nof a sick friend, when the curate entered. He excused himself for\r\nnot having called earlier, by explaining that \"Turing\" had sent him\r\na message informing him that as the vicar (a native) had gone to\r\nManila, he might take charge of the church and parish. \"Is 'Turing'\r\nan assistant curate?\" I inquired. My friend and the pastor were so\r\nconvulsed with laughter at the idea, that it was quite five minutes\r\nbefore they could explain that the intimation respecting the parochial\r\nbusiness emanated from the absent vicar's _bonne amie_.\r\n\r\nConsanguine marriages are very common, and perhaps this accounts for\r\nthe low intellect and mental debility perceptible in many families.\r\n\r\nPoor parents offer their girls to Europeans for a loan of money,\r\nand they are admitted under the pseudonym of sempstress or\r\nhousekeeper. Natives among themselves do not kiss--they smell each\r\nother, or rather, they place the nose and lip on the cheek and draw\r\na long breath.\r\n\r\nMarriages between Spaniards and pure native women, although less\r\nfrequent than formerly, still take place. Since 1899 many Americans,\r\ntoo, have taken pure native wives. It is difficult to apprehend an\r\nalliance so incongruous, there being no affinity of ideas, the only\r\ncondition in common being, that they are both human beings professing\r\nChristianity. The husband is either drawn towards the level of\r\nthe native by this heterogeneous relationship, or, in despair of\r\nremedying the error of a passing passion, he practically ignores\r\nhis wife in his own social connections. Each forms then a distinct\r\ncircle of friends of his, or her, own selection, whilst the woman is\r\nbut slightly raised above her own class by the white man's influence\r\nand contact. There are some exceptions, but I have most frequently\r\nobserved in the houses of Europeans married to native women in the\r\nprovinces, that the wives make the kitchen their chief abode, and are\r\nonly seen by the visitor when some domestic duty requires them to move\r\nabout the house. Familiarity breeds contempt, and these _mesalliances_\r\ndiminish the dignity of the superior race by reducing the birth-origin\r\nof both parents to a common level in their children.\r\n\r\nThe Spanish half-breeds and Creoles constitute a very influential\r\nbody. A great number of them are established in trade in Manila and\r\nthe provinces. Due to their European descent, more or less distant,\r\nthey are of quicker perception, greater tact, and gifted with wider\r\nintellectual faculties than the pure Oriental class. Also, the Chinese\r\nhalf-breeds,--a caste of Chinese fathers and Philippine mothers,--who\r\nform about one-sixth of the Manila population, are shrewder than\r\nthe natives of pure extraction, their striking characteristic being\r\ndistrust and suspicion of another's intentions. It is a curious\r\nfact that the Chinese half-caste speaks with as much contempt of\r\nthe Chinaman as the thorough-bred Filipino does, and would fain\r\nhide his paternal descent. There are numbers of Spanish half-breeds\r\nfairly well educated, and just a few of them very talented. Many\r\nof them have succeeded in making pretty considerable fortunes in\r\ntheir negotiations, as middlemen, between the provincial natives\r\nand the European commercial houses. Their true social position is\r\noften an equivocal one, and the complex question has constantly to\r\nbe confronted whether to regard a Spanish demi-sang from a native or\r\nEuropean standpoint. Among themselves they are continually struggling\r\nto attain the respect and consideration accorded to the superior class,\r\nwhilst their connexions and purely native relations link them to the\r\nother side. In this perplexing mental condition, we find them on the\r\none hand striving in vain to disown their affinity to the inferior\r\nraces, and on the other hand, jealous of their true-born European\r\nacquaintances. A morosity of disposition is the natural outcome. Their\r\ncharacter generally is evasive and vacillating. They are captious,\r\nfond of litigation, and constantly seeking subterfuges. They appear\r\nalways dissatisfied with their lot in life, and inclined to foster\r\ngrievances against whoever may be in office over them. Pretentious\r\nin the extreme, they are fond of pomp and paltry show, and it is\r\ndifficult to trace any popular movement, for good or for evil,\r\nwithout discovering a half-breed initiator, or leader, of one caste\r\nor another. They are locally denominated _Mestizos_.\r\n\r\nThe Jesuit Father, Pedro Murillo Velarde, at p. 272 of his work\r\non this Colony, expressed his opinion of the political-economical\r\nresult of mixed marriages to the following effect:--\"Now,\" he says,\r\n\"we have a querulous, discontented population of half-castes, who,\r\nsooner or later, will bring about a distracted state of society, and\r\noccupy the whole force of the Government to stamp out the discord.\" How\r\nfar the prophecy was fulfilled will be seen in another chapter.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBeing naturally prone to superstitious beliefs, the Islanders accepted,\r\nwithout doubting, all the fantastic tales which the early missionaries\r\ntaught them. Miraculous crosses healed the sick, cured the plague,\r\nand scared away the locusts. Images, such as the _Holy Child of Bangi,_\r\nrelieved them of all worldly sufferings. To this day they revere many\r\nof these objects, which are still preserved.\r\n\r\nThe most ancient miraculous image in these Islands appears to be the\r\n_Santo Nino de Cebu_--the Holy Child of Cebu. It is recorded that on\r\nJuly 28, 1565, an image of the Child Jesus was found on Cebu Island\r\nshore by a Basque soldier named Juan de Camus. It was venerated and\r\nkept by the Austin friars. Irreverent persons have alleged it was a\r\npagan idol. Against this, it may be argued that the heathen Cebuanos\r\nwere not known to have been idolaters. In 1627 a fire occurred\r\nin Cebu city, when the Churches of Saint Nicholas and of the Holy\r\nChild were burnt down. The image was saved, and temporarily placed\r\nin charge of the Recoleto friars. A fire also took place on the site\r\nof the first cross erected on the island by Father Martin de Rada,\r\nthe day Legaspi landed, and it is said that this cross, although made\r\nof bamboo, was not consumed. There now stands an Oratory, wherein\r\non special occasions is exposed the original cross. Close by is the\r\nmodern Church of the Holy Child.\r\n\r\nIn June, 1887, the Prior of the convent conducted me to the strong-room\r\nwhere the wonderful image is kept. The Saint is of wood, about fifteen\r\ninches high, and laden with silver trinkets, which have been presented\r\non different occasions. When exposed to public view, it has the\r\nhonours of field-marshal accorded to it. It is a mystic deity with\r\nebon features--so different from the lovely Child presented to us\r\non canvas by the great masters! During the feast held in its honour\r\n(January 20), pilgrims from the remotest districts of the island and\r\nfrom across the seas come to purify their souls at the shrine of \"The\r\nHoly Child.\" In the same room was a beautiful image of the Madonna,\r\nbesides two large tin boxes containing sundry arms, legs, and heads\r\nof Saints, with their robes in readiness for adjustment on procession\r\ndays. The patron of Cebu City is Saint Vidal.\r\n\r\nThe legend of the celestial protector of Manila is not less\r\ninteresting. It is related that in Dilao (now called Paco), near\r\nManila, a wooden image of Saint Francis de Assisi, which was in the\r\nhouse of a native named Alonso Cuyapit, was seen to weep so copiously\r\nthat many cloths were moistened by its tears. The image, with its hands\r\noutspread during three hours, invoked God's blessing on Manila. And\r\nthen, on closing its hands, it grasped a cross and skull. Vows were\r\nmade to the Saint, who was declared protector of the capital, and\r\nthe same image is now to be seen in the Franciscan Church, under\r\nthe appellation of _San Francisco de las lagrimas_--\"Saint Francis\r\nof Tears.\"\r\n\r\nUp to the seventies of last century, a disgusting spectacle used to be\r\nannually witnessed at the Church of San Miguel (Manila) on December 8;\r\nit was a realistic representation of the Immaculate Conception!\r\n\r\n\"Our Lady of Cagsaysay,\" near Taal (Batangas), has been revered for\r\nmany years both by Europeans and natives. So enthusiastic was the\r\nbelief in the miraculous power of this image, that the galleons,\r\nwhen passing the Batangas coast on their way to and from Mexico,\r\nwere accustomed to fire a salute from their guns (_vide_ pp. 18,\r\n19). This image was picked up by a native in his fishing-net, and\r\nhe placed it in a cave, where it was discovered by other natives,\r\nwho imagined they saw many extraordinary lights around it. According\r\nto the local legend, they heard sweet sonorous music proceeding from\r\nthe same spot, and the image came forward and spoke to a native woman,\r\nwho had brought her companions to adore the Saint.\r\n\r\nThe history of the many shrines all over the Colony would well fill\r\na volume; however, by far the most popular one is that of the Virgin\r\nof Antipolo--_Nuestra Senora de Buen Viaje y de la Paz_, \"Our Lady\r\nof Good Voyage and Peace.\"\r\n\r\nThis image is said to have wrought many miracles. It was first brought\r\nfrom Acapulco (Mexico) in 1626 in the State galleon, by Juan Nino de\r\nTabora, who was appointed Gov.-General of these Islands (1626-32) by\r\nKing Philip IV. The Saint, it is alleged, had encountered numberless\r\nreverses between that time and the year 1672, since which date it has\r\nbeen safely lodged in the Parish Church of Antipolo--a village in the\r\nold Military District of Morong (Rizal Province)--in the custody of\r\nthe Austin friars. In the month of May, thousands of people repair to\r\nthis shrine; indeed, this village of 3,800 inhabitants (diminished to\r\n2,800 in 1903) chiefly depends upon the pilgrims for its existence,\r\nfor the land within the jurisdiction of Antipolo is all mountainous\r\nand very limited in extent. The priests also do a very good trade in\r\nprints of Saints, rosaries, etc., for the sale of which, in Spanish\r\ntimes, they used to open a shop during the feast inside and just in\r\nfront of the convent entrance. The total amount of money spent in the\r\nvillage by visitors during the pilgrimage has been roughly computed\r\nto be P30,000. They come from all parts of the Islands.\r\n\r\nThe legends of the Saint are best described in a pamphlet published\r\nin Manila, [81] from which I take the following information.\r\n\r\nThe writer says that the people of Acapulco (Mexico) were loth to\r\npart with their Holy Image, but the saintly Virgin herself, desirous\r\nof succouring the inhabitants of the Spanish Indies, smoothed all\r\ndifficulties. During her first voyage, in the month of March, 1626,\r\na tempest arose, which was calmed by the Virgin, and all arrived\r\nsafely in the galleon at the shores of Manila. She was then carried\r\nin procession to the Cathedral, whilst the church bells tolled and\r\nthe artillery thundered forth salutes of welcome. A solemn Mass was\r\ncelebrated, which all the religious communities, civil authorities,\r\nand a multitude of people attended.\r\n\r\nSix years afterwards the Gov.-General Juan Nino de Tabora died. By\r\nhis will he intrusted the Virgin to the care of the Jesuits, whilst\r\na church was being built under the direction of Father Juan Salazar\r\nfor her special reception. During the erection of this church, the\r\nVirgin often descended from the altar and exhibited herself amongst the\r\nflowery branches of a tree, called by the natives Antipolo (_Artocarpus\r\nincisa_). The tree itself was thenceforth regarded as a precious relic\r\nby the natives, who, leaf by leaf and branch by branch, were gradually\r\ncarrying it off. Then Father Salazar decreed that the tree-trunk should\r\nserve for a pedestal to the Divine Miraculous Image--hence the title\r\n\"Virgin of Antipolo.\"\r\n\r\nIn 1639 the Chinese rebelled against the Spanish authority (_vide_\r\np. 115). In their furious march through the ruins and the blood of\r\ntheir victims, and amidst the wailing of the crowd, they attacked the\r\nSanctuary wherein reposed the Virgin. Seizing the Holy Image, they\r\ncast it into the flames, and when all around was reduced to ashes,\r\nthere stood the Virgin of Antipolo, resplendent, with her hair,\r\nher lace, her ribbons and adornments intact, and her beautiful body\r\nof brass without wound or blemish! Passionate at seeing frustrated\r\ntheir designs to destroy the deified protectress of the Christians,\r\na wanton infidel stabbed her in the face, and all the resources of\r\nart have ever failed to heal the lasting wound. Again the Virgin\r\nwas enveloped in flames, which hid the appalling sight of her\r\nburning entrails. Now the Spanish troops arrived, and fell upon\r\nthe heretical marauders with great slaughter; then, glancing with\r\ntrembling anxiety upon the scene of the outrage, behold! with glad\r\nastonishment they descried the Holy Image upon a smouldering pile\r\nof ashes--unhurt! With renewed enthusiasm, the Spanish warriors bore\r\naway the Virgin on their shoulders in triumph, and Sebastian Hurtado\r\nde Corcuera, the Gov.-General at the time, had her conveyed to Cavite\r\nto be the patroness of the faithful upon the high seas.\r\n\r\nA galleon arrived at Cavite, and being unable to go into port, the\r\ncommander anchored off at a distance. Then the new Gov.-General,\r\nDiego Fajardo (1644-53), sent the Virgin on board, and, by her help,\r\na passage was found for the vessel to enter.\r\n\r\nLater on, twelve Dutch warships appeared off Mariveles, the\r\nnorthwestern extremity of Manila Bay. They had come to attack Cavite,\r\nand in their hour of danger the Spaniards appealed to the Virgin,\r\nwho gave them a complete victory over the Dutchmen, causing them\r\nto flee, with their commander mortally wounded. During the affray,\r\nthe Virgin had been taken away for safety on board the _San Diego_,\r\ncommanded by Cepeda. In 1650 this vessel returned, and the pious\r\nprelate, Jose Millan Poblete, [82] thought he perceived clear\r\nindications of an eager desire on the part of the Virgin to retire to\r\nher Sanctuary. The people, too, clamoured for the Saint, attributing\r\nthe many calamities with which they were afflicted at that period\r\nto her absence from their shores. Assailed by enemies, frequently\r\nthreatened by the Dutch, lamenting the loss of several galleons,\r\nand distressed by a serious earthquake, their only hope reposed in\r\nthe beneficent aid of the Virgin of Antipolo.\r\n\r\nBut the galleon _San Francisco Xavier_ feared to make the journey\r\nto Mexico without the saintly support, and for the sixth time the\r\nVirgin crossed the Pacific Ocean. In Acapulco the galleon lay at\r\nanchor until March, 1653, when the newly-appointed Gov.-General,\r\nSabiniano Manrique de Lara, Archbishop Miguel Poblete, Father\r\nRodrigo Cardenas, Bishop-elect of Cagayan, and many other passengers\r\nembarked and set sail for Manila. Their sufferings during the voyage\r\nwere horrible. Almost overcome by a violent storm, the ship became\r\nunmanageable. Rain poured in torrents, whilst her decks were washed by\r\nthe surging waves, and all was on the point of utter destruction. In\r\nthis plight the Virgin was exhorted, and not in vain, for at her\r\ncommand the sea lessened its fury, the wind calmed, black threatening\r\nclouds dispersed, all the terrors of the voyage ceased, and under a\r\nbeautiful blue sky a fair wind wafted the galleon safely to the port\r\nof Cavite.\r\n\r\nThese circumstances gained for the Saint the title of \"Virgin of Good\r\nVoyage and Peace\"; and the sailors,--who gratefully acknowledged that\r\ntheir lives were saved by her sublime intercession,--followed by the\r\necclesiastical dignitaries and military chiefs, carried the image to\r\nher retreat in Antipolo (September 8, 1653), where it was intended\r\nshe should permanently remain. However, deprived of the succour of\r\nthe Saint, misfortunes again overtook the galleons. Three of them\r\nwere lost, and the writer of the brochure to which I refer supposes\r\n(Chap. iv.) that perchance the sea, suffering from the number of\r\nfurrows cut by the keels of the ships, had determined to take a fierce\r\nrevenge by swallowing them up!\r\n\r\nOnce more, therefore, the Virgin condescended to accompany a galleon\r\nto Mexico, bringing her back safely to Philippine shores in 1672.\r\n\r\nThis was the Virgin's last sea voyage. Again, and for ever, she was\r\nconveyed by the joyous multitude to her resting-place in Antipolo\r\nChurch, and on her journey thither, there was not a flower, adds the\r\nchronicler, which did not greet her by opening a bud--not a mountain\r\npigeon which remained in silence, whilst the breezes and the rivulets\r\npoured forth their silent murmurings of ecstasy. Saintly guardian\r\nof the soul, dispersing mundane evils!--no colours, the chronicler\r\ntells us, can paint the animation of the faithful; no discourse can\r\ndescribe the consolation of the pilgrims in their adoration at the\r\nShrine of the Holy Virgin of Antipolo.\r\n\r\nYet the village of Antipolo and its neighbourhood was, in Spanish\r\ntimes, the centre of brigandage, the resort of murderous highwaymen,\r\nthe focus of crime. What a strange contrast to the sublime virtues\r\nof the immortal divinity enclosed within its Sanctuary!\r\n\r\nOn November 26, 1904, this miraculous Image was temporarily removed\r\nfrom Antipolo to Manila for the celebration of the feast of the\r\nImmaculate Conception. Carried by willing hands to the place of\r\nembarkation, it made the voyage to the capital, down the Pasig\r\nRiver, in a gorgeously decorated barge, towed by a steam launch,\r\nescorted by hundreds of floating craft and over 20,000 natives,\r\nmarching along the river banks in respectful accompaniment. The next\r\nday a procession of about 35,000 persons followed the Virgin to the\r\nCathedral of Manila, where she was enshrined, awaiting the great event\r\nof December 8. Subsequently she was restored to her shrine at Antipolo.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe most lucrative undertaking in the Colony is that of a shrine. It\r\nyields all gain, without possible loss. Among the most popular of\r\nthese \"Miraculous Saint Shows\" was that of Gusi, belonging to the\r\nlate parish priest of Ilug, in Negros Island. At Gusi, half an hour's\r\nwalk from the Father's parish church, was enthroned San Joaquin,\r\nwho, for a small consideration, consoled the faithful or relieved\r\nthem of iheir sufferings. His spouse, Santa Ana, having taken up\r\nher residence in the town of Molo (Yloilo Province), was said to\r\nhave been visited by San Joaquin once a year. He was absent on the\r\njourney at least a fortnight, but the waters in the neighbourhood of\r\nthe Shrine being sanctified the _clientele_ was not dispersed. Some\r\nsceptics have dared to doubt whether San Joaquin really paid this\r\nvisit to his saintly wife, and alleged that his absence was feigned,\r\nfirstly to make his presence longed for, and secondly to remove the\r\ncobwebs from his hallowed brow, and give him a wash and brush up for\r\nthe year. The Shrine paid well for years--every devotee leaving his\r\nmite. At the time of my pilgrimage there, the holy Father's son was\r\nthe petty-governor of the same town of Ilug.\r\n\r\nShrine-owners are apparently no friends of free trade. In 1888 there\r\nwas a great commotion amongst them when it was discovered that a\r\nwould-be competitor and a gownsman had conspired, in Pampanga Province,\r\nto establish a Miraculous Saint, by concealing an image in a field\r\nin order that it should \"make itself manifest to the faithful,\"\r\nand thenceforth become a source of income.\r\n\r\nIt is notorious that in a church near Manila, a few years ago,\r\nan image was made to move the parts of its body as the reverend\r\npreacher exhorted it in the course of his sermon. When he appealed\r\nto the Saint, it wagged its head or extended its arms, whilst the\r\nfemale audience wept and wailed. Such a scandalous disturbance did\r\nit provoke that the exhibition was even too monstrous for the clergy\r\nthemselves, and the Archbishop prohibited it. But religion has many\r\nwealth-producing branches. In January, 1889, a friend of mine showed\r\nme an account rendered by the Superior of the Jesuits' School for\r\nthe education of his sons, each of whom was charged with one peso as\r\na gratuity to the Pope, to induce him to canonize a deceased member\r\nof their Order. I have been most positively assured by friends, whose\r\ngood faith I ought not to doubt, that San Pascual Bailon really has,\r\non many occasions, had compassion on barren women (their friends)\r\nand given them offspring. Jose Rizal, in his \"Noli me tangere\" hints\r\nthat the real Pascual was a friar.\r\n\r\nTrading upon the credulity of devout enthusiasts by fetishism and\r\nshrine quackery is not altogether confined to the ecclesiastics. A\r\nSpanish layman in Yloilo, some few years ago, when he was an official\r\nof the prison, known as the \"Cotta,\" conceived the idea of declaring\r\nthat the Blessed Virgin and Child Jesus had appeared in the prison\r\nwell, where they took a bath and disappeared. When, at length,\r\nthe belief became popular, hundreds of natives went there to get\r\nwater from the well, and the official imposed a tax on the pilgrims,\r\nwhereby he became possessed of a modest fortune, and owned two of\r\nthe best houses in the Square of Yloilo.\r\n\r\nThe Feast of Tigbauang (near Yloilo), which takes place in January,\r\nis also much frequented on account of the miracles performed by\r\nthe patron Saint of the town. The faith in the power of this minor\r\ndivinity to dispel bodily suffering is so deeply rooted that members\r\nof the most enlightened families of Yloilo and the neighbouring towns\r\ngo to Tigbauang simply to attend High Mass, and return at once. I\r\nhave seen steamers entering Yloilo from this feast so crowded with\r\npassengers that there was only standing room for them.\r\n\r\nAn opprobrious form of religious imposture--perhaps the most\r\ncontemptible--which frequently offended the public eye, before the\r\nAmerican advent, was the practice of prowling about with doll-saints\r\nin the streets and public highways. A vagrant, too lazy to earn an\r\nhonest subsistence, procured a licence from the monks to hawk about a\r\nwooden box containing a doll or print covered by a pane of glass. This\r\nhe offered to hold before the nose of any ignorant passer-by who was\r\nwilling to pay for the boon of kissing the glass!\r\n\r\nDuring Holy Week, a few years ago, the captain of the Civil Guard\r\nin Tayabas Province went to the town of Atimonan, and saw natives\r\nin the streets almost in a state of nudity doing penance \"for the\r\nwounds of Our Lord.\" They were actually beating themselves with\r\nflails, some of which were made of iron chain, and others of rope\r\nwith thongs of rattan-cane. Having confiscated the flails--one of\r\nwhich he gave to me--he effectually assisted the fanatics in their\r\npenitent castigation. Alas! to what excesses will faith, unrestrained\r\nby reason, bring one!\r\n\r\nThe result of tuition in mystic influences is sometimes manifested\r\nin the appearance of native Santones--indolent scamps who roam\r\nabout in remote villages, feigning the possession of supernatural\r\ngifts, the faculty of saving souls, and the healing art, with the\r\nobject of living at the expense of the ignorant. I never happened\r\nto meet more than one of these creatures--an escaped convict named\r\nApolonio, a native of Cabuyao (Laguna), who, assuming the character\r\nof a prophet and worker of miracles, had fled to the neighbourhood\r\nof San Pablo village. I have often heard of them in other places,\r\nnotably in Capis Province, where the Santones were vigorously pursued\r\nby the Civil Guard, and as recently as May, 1904, a notorious humbug\r\nof this class, styling himself _Pope Isio, alias Nazarenong Gala_,\r\nwas arrested in West Negros and punished under American authority.\r\n\r\nThe Spanish clergy were justifiably zealous in guarding the Filipinos\r\nfrom a knowledge of other doctrines which would only lead them to\r\nimmeasurable bewilderment. Hence all the civilized natives were\r\nRoman Catholics exclusively. The strict obedience to _one_ system\r\nof Christianity, even in its grossly perverted form, had the effect\r\ndesired by the State, of bringing about social unity to an advanced\r\ndegree. Yet, so far as I have observed, the native seems to understand\r\nextremely little of the \"inward and spiritual grace\" of religion. He\r\nis so material and realistic, so devoid of all conception of things\r\nabstract, that his ideas rarely, if ever, soar beyond the contemplation\r\nof the \"outward and visible signs\" of christian belief. The symbols\r\nof faith and the observance of religious rites are to him religion\r\nitself. He also confounds morality with religion. Natives go to church\r\nbecause it is the custom. Often if a native cannot put on a clean\r\nshirt, he abstains from going to Mass. The petty-governor of a town\r\nwas compelled to go to High Mass accompanied by his \"ministry.\" In\r\nsome towns the _Barangay Chiefs_ were fined or beaten if they were\r\nabsent from church on Sundays and certain Feast Days. [83]\r\n\r\nAs to the women, little or no pressure was necessary to oblige them\r\nto attend Mass; many of them pass half their existence between private\r\ndevotion and the confessional.\r\n\r\nThe parish priest of Lipa (Batangas) related to a friend of mine that\r\nhaving on one occasion distributed all his stock of pictures of the\r\nSaints to those who had come to see him on parochial business, he\r\nhad to content the last suppliant with an empty raisin-box, without\r\nnoticing that on the lid there was a coloured print of Garibaldi. Later\r\non Garibaldi's portrait was seen in a hut in one of the suburbs with\r\ncandles around it, being adored as a Saint.\r\n\r\nA curious case of native religious philosophy was reported in a\r\nManila newspaper. [84] A milkman, accused by one of his customers of\r\nhaving adulterated the milk, of course denied it at first, and then,\r\nyielding to more potent argument than words, he confessed that he had\r\ndiluted the milk with _holy water from the church fonts_, for at the\r\nsame time that he committed the sin he was penitent.\r\n\r\nUndoubtedly Roman Catholicism appears to be the form of Christianity\r\nmost successful in proselytizing uncivilized races, which are impressed\r\nmore through their eyes than their understanding. If the grandeur of\r\nthe ritual, the magnificence of the processions, the lustre of the\r\nchurch vessels and the images themselves have never been understood\r\nby the masses in the strictly symbolic sense in which they appeal\r\nto us, at least they have had their influence in drawing millions to\r\ncivilization and to a unique uniformity of precept, the practice of\r\nwhich it is beyond all human power to control.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFor Music the native has an inherent passion. Musicians are to be found\r\nin every village, and even among the very poorest classes. Before\r\nthe Revolution there was scarcely a parish, however remote, without\r\nits orchestra, and this natural taste was laudably encouraged by the\r\npriests. Some of these bands acquired great local fame, and were sought\r\nfor wherever there was a feast miles away. The players seemed to enjoy\r\nit as much as the listeners, and they would keep at it for hours at a\r\ntime, as long as their bodily strength lasted. Girls from six years\r\nof age learn to play the harp almost by instinct, and college girls\r\nquickly learn the piano. There are no native composers--they are but\r\nimitators. There is an absence of sentimental feeling in the execution\r\nof set music (which is all foreign), and this is the only drawback to\r\ntheir becoming fine instrumentalists. For the same reason, classical\r\nmusic is very little in vogue among the Philippine people, who prefer\r\ndance pieces and ballad accompaniments. In fact, a native musical\r\nperformance is so void of soul and true conception of harmony that\r\nat a feast it is not an uncommon thing to hear three bands playing\r\nclose to each other at the same time; and the mob assembled seem to\r\nenjoy the confusion of the melody! There are no Philippine vocalists\r\nworth hearing.\r\n\r\nTravelling through the Laguna Province in 1882 I was impressed by\r\nthe ingenuity of the natives in their imitation of European musical\r\ninstruments. Just an hour before I had emerged from a dense forest,\r\nabundantly adorned with exquisite foliage, and where majestic trees,\r\nflourishing in gorgeous profusion, afforded a gratifying shelter from\r\nthe scorching sun. Not a sound was heard but the gentle ripple of a\r\nlimpid stream, breaking over the boulders on its course towards the\r\nravine below. But it was hardly the moment to ponder on the poetic\r\nscene, for fatigue and hunger had almost overcome sentimentality,\r\nand I got as quickly as I could to the first resting-place. This I\r\nfound to be a native cane-grower's plantation bungalow, where quite\r\na number of persons was assembled, the occasion of the meeting being\r\nthe baptism and benediction of the sugar-cane mill. Before I was\r\nnear enough, however, to be seen by the party--for it was nearly\r\nsunset--I heard the sound of distant music floating through the\r\nair. Such a strange occurrence excited my curiosity immensely, and\r\nI determined to find out what it all meant. I soon discovered that\r\nit was a bamboo band returning from the feast of the \"baptism of the\r\nmill.\" Each instrument was made of bamboo on a semi-European model,\r\nand the players were merely farm-labourers.\r\n\r\nPhilippine musicians have won fame outside their own country. Some\r\nyears ago there was a band of them in Shanghai and another in\r\nCochin China on contract. It was reported, too, that the band of the\r\nConstabulary sent to the St. Louis Exhibition in 1904 was the delight\r\nof the people in Honolulu, where they touched _en route_.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSlavery was prohibited by law as far back as the reign of Philip\r\nII.; [85] it nevertheless still exists in an occult form among\r\nthe natives. Rarely, if ever, do its victims appeal to the law\r\nfor redress, firstly, because of their ignorance, and secondly,\r\nbecause the untutored class have an innate horror of resisting\r\nanciently-established custom, and it would never occur to them\r\nto do so. Moreover, in the time of the Spaniards, the numberless\r\n_procuradores_ and _pica-pleitos_--touting solicitors had no interest\r\nin taking up cases so profitless to themselves. Under the pretext\r\nof guaranteeing a loan, parents readily sell their children (male or\r\nfemale) into bondage. The child is handed over to work until the loan\r\nis repaid; but as the day of restitution of the advance never arrives,\r\nneither does the liberty of the youthful victim. Among themselves\r\nit was a law, and is still a practised custom, for the debts of\r\nthe parents to pass on to the children, and, as I have said before,\r\ndebts are never repudiated by them. Slavery, in an overt form, now\r\nonly exists among some wild tribes and the Moros.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEducation was almost exclusively under the control of the friars. Up\r\nto the year 1844 anything beyond religious tuition was reserved\r\nfor the Spanish youth, the half-castes, and the children of\r\nthose in office. Among the many reforms introduced in the time of\r\nGov.-General Narciso Claveria (1844-49), that of extending Education\r\nto the provincial parishes was a failure. In the middle of the reign\r\nof Isabella II. (about 1850) it was the exclusive privilege of the\r\nclasses mentioned and the native petty aristocracy, locally designated\r\nthe _gente ilustrada_ and the _pudientes_ (Intellectuals and people\r\nof means and influence). Education, thus limited, divided the people\r\ninto two separate castes, as distinct as the ancient Roman citizen and\r\nthe plebeian. Residing chiefly in the ports open to foreign trade,\r\nthe Intellectuals acquired wealth, possessed rich estates and fine\r\nhouses artistically adorned. Blessed with all the comforts which\r\nmoney could procure and the refinement resulting from education, they\r\nfreely associated and intermarried with the Spaniards, whose easy grace\r\nand dignified manners they gradually acquired and retain, to a great\r\nextent, to the present day. The other caste--the Illiterates--were\r\ndependents of the Intellectuals. Without mental training, with few\r\nwants, and little expenses, they were as contented, in their sphere,\r\nas the upper class were in theirs. Like their masters, they had their\r\nhopes, but they never knew what misery was, as one understands it in\r\nEurope, and in this felicitous, ambitionless condition, they never\r\nurgently demanded education, even for their children. The movement came\r\nfrom higher quarters, and during the O'Donnell ministry a Royal Decree\r\nwas sent from Madrid establishing schools throughout the provinces.\r\n\r\nOn the banks of the Pasig River there was a training college for\r\nschoolmasters, who were drafted off to the villages with a miserable\r\nstipend, to teach the juvenile rustics. But the governmental system\r\nof centralization fell somewhat hard on the village teacher. For\r\ninstance, I knew one who received a monthly salary of 16 pesos,\r\nand every month he had to spend two of them to travel to Manila and\r\nback to receive the money--an outlay equal to 12 1/2 per cent. of his\r\ntotal income. For such a wretched pittance great things were not to\r\nbe expected of the teacher, even though he had had a free hand in his\r\nwork. Other circumstances of greater weight contributed to keep the\r\nstandard of education among the common townfolk very low; in some\r\nplaces to abolish it totally. The parish priests were _ex-officio_\r\nInspectors of Schools for primary instruction, wherein it was their\r\nduty to see that the Spanish language was taught. The old \"Laws\r\nof the Indies\" provided that christian doctrine should be taught\r\nto the heathen native in Spanish. [86] Several decrees confirming\r\nthat law were issued from time to time, but their fulfilment did\r\nnot seem to suit the policy of the friars. On June 30, 1887, the\r\nGov.-General published another decree with the same object, and sent\r\na communication to the Archbishop to remind him of this obligation\r\nof his subordinates, and the urgency of its strict observance. But it\r\nhad no effect whatever, and the poor-class villagers were only taught\r\nto gabble off the christian doctrine by rote, for it suited the friar\r\nto stimulate that peculiar mental condition in which belief precedes\r\nunderstanding. The school-teacher, being subordinate to the inspector,\r\nhad no voice in the matter, and was compelled to follow the views of\r\nthe priest. Few Spaniards took the trouble to learn native dialects (of\r\nwhich there are about 30), and only a small percentage of the natives\r\ncan speak intelligible Spanish. There is no literature in dialect; the\r\nfew odd compositions in Tagalog still extant are wanting in the first\r\nprinciples of literary style. There were many villages with untrained\r\nteachers who could not speak Spanish; there were other villages with\r\nno schools at all, hence no preparation whatever for municipal life.\r\n\r\nIf the friars had agreed to the instruction of the townfolk through the\r\nmedium of Spanish, as a means to the attainment of higher culture, one\r\ncould well have understood their reluctance to teach it to the rural\r\nlabourers, because it is obvious to any one who knows the character\r\nof this class that the knowledge of a foreign language would unfit\r\nthem for agricultural labour and the lower occupations, and produce\r\na new social problem. Even this class, however, might have been\r\nmentally improved by elementary books translated into dialect. But,\r\nunfortunately, the friars were altogether opposed to the education\r\nof the masses, whether through dialect or Spanish, in order to hold\r\nthem in ignorant subjection to their own will, and the result was\r\nthat the majority grew up as untutored as when they were born.\r\n\r\nHome discipline and training of manners were ignored, even in\r\nwell-to-do families. Children were left without control, and by\r\nexcessive indulgence allowed to do just as they pleased; hence they\r\nbecame ill-behaved and boorish.\r\n\r\nPlanters of means, and others who could afford it, sent their sons and\r\ndaughters to private schools, or to the colleges under the direction\r\nof the priests in Manila, Jaro (Yloilo Province), or Cebu. A few--very\r\nfew--sent their sons to study in Europe, or in Hong-Kong.\r\n\r\nAccording to the Budget of 1888 the State contributed to the expense\r\nof Education, in that year, as follows, viz.:--\r\n\r\n\r\n                                                               P. cts.\r\nSchools and Colleges for high-class education in Manila,\r\nincluding Navigation, Drawing, Painting, Book-keeping,\r\nLanguages, History, Arts and Trades, Natural History\r\nMuseum and Library and general instruction.                 86,450 00\r\nSchool of Agriculture (including 10 schools and model\r\nfarms in 10 Provinces)                                     113,686 64\r\nGeneral Expenses of Public Instruction, including National\r\nSchools in the Provinces                                    38,513 70\r\n                                                           ==========\r\n                                                          P238,650 34\r\n\r\n\r\nThe teaching offered to students in Manila was very advanced, as will\r\nbe seen from the following Syllabus of Education in the Municipal\r\nAthenaeum of the Jesuits:--\r\n\r\n\r\n    Agriculture.            Geometry.           Philosophy.\r\n    Algebra.                Greek.              Physics and Chemistry.\r\n    Arithmetic.             History.            Rhetoric and Poetry.\r\n    Commerce.               Latin.              Spanish Classics.\r\n    Geography.              Mechanics.          Spanish Composition.\r\n    English.                Natural History.    Topography.\r\n    French.                 Painting.           Trigonometry.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the highest Girls' School--the Santa Isabel College--the following\r\nwas the curriculum, viz.:--\r\n\r\n\r\n    Arithmetic.             Geology.            Philippine History.\r\n    Drawing.                Geometry.           Physics.\r\n    Dress-cutting.          History of Spain.   Reading.\r\n    French.                 Music.              Sacred History.\r\n    Geography.              Needlework.         Spanish Grammar.\r\n\r\n\r\nThere were also (for girls) the Colleges of Santa Catalina, Santa\r\nRosa, La Concordia, the Municipal School, etc. A few were sent to\r\nthe Italian Convent in Hong-Kong.\r\n\r\nA college known as Saint Thomas' was founded in Manila by Fray Miguel\r\nde Benavides, third Archbishop of Manila, between the years 1603\r\nand 1610. He contributed to it his library and P 1,000, to which\r\nwas added a donation by the Bishop of Nueva Segovia of P 3,000 and\r\nhis library. In 1620 it already had professors and masters under\r\nGovernment auspices. It received three Papal Briefs for 10 years\r\neach, permitting students to graduate in Philosophy and Theology. It\r\nwas then raised to the status of a University in the time of Philip\r\nIV. by Papal Bull of November 20, 1645. The first rector of Saint\r\nThomas' University was Fray Martin Real de la Cruz. In the meantime,\r\nthe Jesuits' University had been established. Until 1645 it was the\r\nonly place of learning superior to primary education, and conferred\r\ndegrees. The Saint Thomas' University (under the direction of Dominican\r\nfriars) now disputed the Jesuits' privilege to confer degrees, claiming\r\nfor themselves exclusive right by Papal Bull. A lawsuit followed, and\r\nthe Supreme Court of Manila decided in favour of Saint Thomas'. The\r\nJesuits appealed to the King against this decision. The Supreme Council\r\nof the Indies was consulted, and revoked the decision of the Manila\r\nSupreme Court, so that the two Universities continued to give degrees\r\nuntil the Jesuits were expelled from the Colony in 1768. From 1785\r\nSaint Thomas' University was styled the \"Royal University,\" and was\r\ndeclared to rank equally with the Peninsular Universities.\r\n\r\nThere were also the Dominican College of San Juan de Letran, founded\r\nin the middle of the 17th century, the Jesuit Normal School, the\r\nConvent of Mercy for Orphan Students, and the College of Saint\r\nJoseph. This last was founded in 1601, under the direction of the\r\nJesuits. King Philip V. gave it the title of \"Royal College,\" and\r\nallowed an escutcheon to be erected over the entrance. The same king\r\nendowed three professorial chairs with P 10,000 each. Latterly it was\r\ngoverned by the Rector of the University, whilst the administration\r\nwas confided to a licentiate in pharmacy.\r\n\r\nAt the time of the Spanish evacuation, therefore, the only university\r\nin the City of Manila was that of Saint Thomas, which was empowered to\r\nissue diplomas of licentiate in law, theology, medicine, and pharmacy\r\nto all successful candidates, and to confer degrees of LL.D. The\r\npublic investiture was presided over by the Rector of the University, a\r\nDominican friar; and the speeches preceding and following the ceremony,\r\nwhich was semi-religious, were made in the Spanish language.\r\n\r\nIn connection with this institution there was the modern Saint Thomas'\r\nCollege for preparing students for the University.\r\n\r\nThe Nautical School naturally stood outside the sphere of\r\necclesiastical control. Established in 1839 in Calle Cabildo (walled\r\ncity), its purpose was to instruct youths in the science of navigation\r\nand prepare them for the merchant service within the waters of the\r\nArchipelago and the adjacent seas. During the earthquake of 1863 the\r\nschool building was destroyed. It was then re-established in Calle\r\nSan Juan de Letran, subsequently located in Calle del Palacio, and\r\nwas finally (in 1898) removed from the walled city to the business\r\nquarter of Binondo. Special attention was given to the teaching of\r\nmathematics, and considerable sums of money were allocated, from time\r\nto time, for the equipment of this technical centre of learning.\r\n\r\nOne of the most interesting and amusing types of the native was\r\nthe average college student from the provinces. After a course\r\nof two, three, up to eight years, he learnt to imitate European\r\ndress and ape Western manners; to fantastically dress his hair;\r\nto wear patent-leather shoes, jewellery, and a latest-fashioned\r\nfelt hat adjusted carefully towards one side of his head. He went\r\nto the theatre, drove a \"tilbury,\" and attended native _reunions_,\r\nto deploy his abilities before the _beau sexe_ of his class. During\r\nhis residence in the capital, he was supposed to learn, amongst\r\nother subjects, Latin, Divinity, Philosophy, and sometimes Theology,\r\npreparatory, in many cases, to succeeding his father in a sugar-cane\r\nand rice plantation. The average student had barely an outline idea\r\nof either physical or political geography, whilst his notions of\r\nSpanish or universal history were very chaotic. I really think the\r\nManila newspapers--poor as they were--contributed very largely to\r\nthe education of the people in this Colony.\r\n\r\nStill, there are cases of an ardent genius shining as an exception to\r\nhis race. Amongst the few, there were two brothers named Luna--the\r\none was a notably skilful performer on the guitar and violin, who,\r\nhowever, died at an early age. The other, Juan Luna, developed\r\na natural ability for painting. A work of his own conception--the\r\n\"Spoliarium,\" executed by him in Rome in 1884--gained the second prize\r\nat the Madrid Academy Exhibition of Oil Paintings. The Municipality\r\nof Barcelona purchased this _chef d'oeuvre_ for the City Hall. Other\r\nfamous productions of his are \"The Battle of Lepanto,\" \"The Death of\r\nCleopatra,\" and \"The Blood Compact\" (q.v). This last masterpiece\r\nwas acquired by the Municipality of Manila for the City Hall,\r\nbut was removed when the Tagalog Rebellion broke out, for reasons\r\nwhich will be understood after reading Chapter xxii. This artist,\r\nthe son of poor parents, was a second mate on board a sailing ship,\r\nwhen his gifts were recognized, and means were furnished him with\r\nwhich to study in Rome. His talent was quite exceptional, for these\r\nIslanders are not an artistic people. Having little admiration for\r\nthe picturesque and the beautiful in Nature, they cannot depict them:\r\nin this respect they form a decided contrast to the Japanese. Paete\r\n(La Laguna) is the only place I know of in the provinces where there\r\nare sculptors by profession. The Manila Academy was open to all comers\r\nof all nationalities, and, as an ex-student under its Professors Don\r\nLorenzo Rocha and Don Agustin Saez, I can attest to their enthusiasm\r\nfor the progress of their pupils.\r\n\r\nIn the General Post and Telegraph Office in Manila I was shown an\r\nexcellent specimen of wood-carving--a bust portrait of Mr. Morse\r\n(the celebrated inventor of the Morse system of telegraphy)--the work\r\nof a native sculptor. Another promising native, Vicente Francisco,\r\nexhibited some good sculpture work in the Philippine Exhibition, held\r\nin Madrid in 1887: the jury recommended him for a State pension, to\r\nstudy in Madrid and Rome. The beautiful design of the present insular\r\ncoinage (Philippine peso) is the work of a Filipino. The biography\r\nof the patriot martyr Dr. Jose Rizal (q.v.), the most brilliant of\r\nall Filipinos, is related in another chapter.\r\n\r\nThe native of cultivated intellect, on returning from Europe, found a\r\nvery limited circle of friends of his own new training. If he returned\r\na lawyer or a doctor, he was one too many, for the capital swarmed\r\nwith them; if he had learnt a trade, his knowledge was useless outside\r\nManila, and in his native village his technical acquirements were\r\ngenerally profitless. Usually the native's sojourn in Europe made\r\nhim too self-opinionated to become a useful member of society. It\r\nremains to be seen how American training will affect them.\r\n\r\nThe (American) Insular Government has taken up the matter of Philippine\r\neducation very earnestly, and at considerable outlay: the subject is\r\nreferred to in Chapter xxx.\r\n\r\nThe intellectual and spiritual life, as we have it in Europe, does\r\nnot exist in the Philippines. If ever a Filipino studied any subject,\r\npurely for the love of study, without the hope of material or social\r\nadvantage being derived therefrom, he would be a _rara avis_.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe _Disease_ most prevalent among the Filipinos is fever--especially\r\nin the spring: and although, in general, they may be considered a\r\nrobust, enduring race, they are less capable than the European of\r\nwithstanding acute disease. I should say that quite 50 per cent. of\r\nthe native population are affected by cutaneous disease, said to be\r\ncaused by eating fish daily, and especially shell-fish. It is locally\r\nknown as _Sarnas_: natives say that monkey flesh cures it.\r\n\r\nIn 1882 _Cholera morbus_ in epidemic form ravaged the native\r\npopulation, carrying off thousands of victims, the exact number of\r\nwhich has never been published. The preventive recommended by the\r\npriests on this occasion, viz., prayer to Saint Roque, proved quite\r\nineffectual to stay the plague. A better remedy, found in the country,\r\nis an infusion of _Niota tetrapetala_ (Tagalog, _Manungal_). From time\r\nto time this disease reappears. The returns given in the _Official\r\nGazette_ of March 2, 1904, Vol. II., No. 9, show the average monthly\r\nmortality due to _Cholera_, in the 20-1/3 months between March 20,\r\n1902, and December 1, 1903, to be 5,360. Annually, many natives suffer\r\nfrom what is called _Colerin_--a mild form of _Cholera_, but not\r\nepidemic. In the spring, deaths always occur from acute indigestion,\r\ndue to eating too plentifully of new rice. Many who have recovered\r\nfrom _Cholera_ become victims to a disease known as _Beri-Beri_,\r\nsaid to be caused by the rice and fish diet. The first symptom of\r\n_Wet Beri-Beri_ is a swelling of the legs, like dropsy; that of _Dry\r\nBeri-Beri_ is a wasting away of the limbs. _Smallpox_ makes great\r\nravages, and _Measles_ is a common complaint. _Lung_ and _Bronchial_\r\naffections are very rare. The most fearful disease in the Colony is\r\n_Leprosy_. [87] To my knowledge it is prevalent in the Province of\r\nBulacan (Luzon Is.), and in the islands of Cebu and Negros. There is an\r\nasylum for lepers near Manila and at Mabolo, just outside the City of\r\nCebu (_vide_ Lepers), but no practical measures were ever adopted by\r\nthe Spaniards to eradicate this disease. The Spanish authorities were\r\nalways too indifferent about the propagation of leprosy to establish\r\na home on one island for all male lepers and another home, on another\r\nisland, for female lepers--the only effectual way to extirpate this\r\nawful malady. In Baliuag (Bulacan), leper families, personally known\r\nto me, were allowed to mix with the general public. In Cebu and Negros\r\nIslands they were permitted to roam about on the highroads and beg.\r\n\r\nThe Insular Government has taken up the question of the Lepers,\r\nand in 1904 a tract of land was purchased in the Island of Culion\r\n(Calamianes group) to provide for their hygienic isolation. According\r\nto the _Official Gazette_ of March 2, 1904, Vol. II., No. 9, the\r\ntotal number of lepers, of whom the Insular Government had obtained\r\ncognizance, up to December 31, 1903, was 3,343. Besides these there\r\nwould naturally be an unknown number who had escaped recognition.\r\n\r\nThere is apparently little _Insanity_ in the Islands. From the\r\nReport of the Commissioner of Public Health for February, 1904,\r\nit would appear that there were only about 1,415 insane persons in\r\na population of over seven-and-a-half millions.\r\n\r\nSince the American advent (1898) the _Death-rate_ is believed to have\r\nnotably decreased. The Report of the Commissioner of Public Health\r\nfor 1904 states the death-rate per thousand in Manila to have been as\r\nfollows, viz.:--Natives 53.72; Europeans other than Spaniards 16.11;\r\nSpaniards 15.42; and Americans 9.34. The Commissioner remarks that\r\n\"over 50 per cent. of the children born in the city of Manila never\r\nlive to see the first anniversary of their birthday.\" The Board of\r\nHealth is very active in the sanitation of Manila. Inspectors make\r\nfrequent domiciliary visits. The extermination of rats in the month\r\nof December, 1903, amounted to 24,638. House-refuse bins are put into\r\nthe streets at night, and an inspector goes round with a lamp about\r\nmidnight to examine them. Dead animals, market-rubbish, house-refuse,\r\nrotten hemp, sweepings, etc., are all cremated at Palomar, Santa Cruz,\r\nand Paco, and in July, 1904, this enterprising department started\r\nthe extermination of mosquitoes! In the suburbs of Manila there are\r\nnow twelve cemeteries and one crematorium.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XII\r\n\r\nThe Religious Orders\r\n\r\n\r\nHistory attests that at least during the first two centuries of Spanish\r\nrule, the subjugation of the natives and their acquiescence in the\r\nnew order of things were obtained more by the subtle influence of the\r\nmissionaries than by the sword. As the soldiers of Castile carried war\r\ninto the interior and forced its inhabitants to recognize their King,\r\nso the friars were drafted off from the mother country to mitigate\r\nthe memory of bloodshed and to mould Spain's new subjects to social\r\nequanimity. In many cases, in fact, the whole task of gaining their\r\nsubmission to the Spanish Crown and obedience to the dictates of\r\nWestern civilization was confided solely to the pacific medium of\r\npersuasion. The difficult mission of holding in check the natural\r\npassions and instincts of a race which knew no law but individual\r\nwill, was left to the successors of Urdaneta. Indeed, it was but the\r\ngeneral policy of Philip II. to aggrandize his vast realm under the\r\npretence of rescuing benighted souls. The efficacy of conversion was\r\nnever doubted for a moment, however suddenly it might come to pass,\r\nand the Spanish cavalier conscientiously felt that he had a high\r\nmission to fulfil under the Banner of the Cross. In every natural\r\nevent which coincided with their interests, in the prosecution of\r\ntheir mission, the wary priests descried a providential miracle.\r\n\r\nIn their opinion the non-Catholic had no rights in this world--no\r\nprospect of gaining the next. If the Pope claimed the whole world\r\n(such as was known of it) to be in his gift--how much more so heathen\r\nlands! The obligation to convert was imposed by the Pope, and was\r\nan inseparable condition of the conceded right of conquest. It was\r\ntherefore constantly paramount in the conqueror's mind. [88] The\r\nPope could depose and give away the realm of any sovereign prince\r\n\"_si vel paulum deflexerit_.\" The Monarch held his sceptre under the\r\nsordid condition of vassalage; hence Philip II., for the security\r\nof his Crown, could not have disobeyed the will of the Pontiff,\r\nwhatever his personal inclinations might have been regarding the\r\nspread of Christianity. [89] If he desired it, he served his ends with\r\nadvantage to himself--if he were indifferent to it, he secured by its\r\nprosecution a formidable ally in Rome. America had already drained the\r\nPeninsula of her able-bodied men to such an extent that a military\r\noccupation of these Islands would have overtaxed the resources of\r\nthe mother country. The co-operation of the friars was, therefore, an\r\nalmost indispensable expedient in the early days, and their power in\r\nsecular concerns was recognized to the last by the Spanish-Philippine\r\nauthorities, who continued to solicit the aid of the parish priests\r\nin order to secure obedience to decrees affecting their parishioners.\r\n\r\nUp to the Rebellion of 1896 the placid word of the ecclesiastic, the\r\nsuperstitious veneration which he inspired in the ignorant native,\r\nhad a greater law-binding effect than the commands of the civil\r\nfunctionary. The gownsman used those weapons appropriate to his\r\noffice which best touched the sensibilities and won the adhesion of\r\na rude audience. The priest appealed to the soul, to the unknown,\r\nto the awful and the mysterious. Go where he would, the convert's\r\nimagination was so pervaded with the mystic tuition that he came\r\nto regard his tutor as a being above common humanity. The feeling\r\nof dread reverence which he instilled into the hearts of the most\r\ncallous secured to him even immunity from the violence of brigands,\r\nwho carefully avoided the man of God. In the State official the native\r\nsaw nothing but a man who strove to bend the will of the conquered race\r\nto suit his own. A Royal Decree or the sound of the cornet would not\r\nhave been half so effective as the elevation of the Holy Cross before\r\nthe fanatical majority, who became an easy prey to fantastic promises\r\nof eternal bliss, or the threats of everlasting perdition. Nor is this\r\nassertion by any means chimerical, for it has been proved on several\r\noccasions, notably in the raising of troops to attempt the expulsion\r\nof the British in 1763, and in the campaign against the Sultan of Sulu\r\nin 1876. But through the Cavite Conspiracy of 1872 (_vide_ p. 106)\r\nthe friars undoubtedly hastened their own downfall. Many natives,\r\ndriven to emigrate, cherished a bitter hatred in exile, whilst others\r\nwere emerging yearly by hundreds from their mental obscurity. Already\r\nthe intellectual struggle for freedom from mystic enthralment had\r\ncommenced without injury to faith in things really divine.\r\n\r\nEach decade brought some reform in the relations between the\r\nparish priest and the people. Link by link the chain of priestcraft\r\nencompassing the development of the Colony was yielding to natural\r\ncauses. The most enlightened natives were beginning to understand that\r\ntheir spiritual wants were not the only care of the friars, and that\r\nthe aim of the Religious Orders was to monopolize all within their\r\nreach, and to subordinate to their common will all beyond their mystic\r\ncircle. The Romish Church owes its power to the uniformity of precept\r\nand practice of the vast majority of its members, and it is precisely\r\nbecause this was the reverse in political Spain--where statesmen are\r\ndivided into a dozen or more groups with distinct policies--that the\r\nChurch was practically unassailable. In the same way, all the members\r\nof a Religious Order are so closely united that a quarrel with one\r\nof them brings the enmity and opposition of his whole community. The\r\nProgressists, therefore, who combated ecclesiastical preponderance in\r\nthe Philippines, demanded the retirement of the friars to conventual\r\nreclusion or missions, and the appointment of _clerigos_, or secular\r\nclergymen to the vicarages and curacies. By such a change they hoped\r\nto remedy the abuses of collective power, for a misunderstanding with\r\na secular vicar would only have provoked a single-handed encounter.\r\n\r\nThat a priest should have been practically a Government agent in his\r\nlocality would not have been contested in the abstract, had he not,\r\nas a consequence, assumed the powers of the old Roman Censors, who\r\nexercised the most dreaded function of the _Regium Morum_. Spanish\r\nopinion, however, was very much divided as to the political safety of\r\nstrictly confining the friars to their religious duties. It was doubted\r\nby some whether any State authority could ever gain the confidence or\r\nrepress the inherent inclinations of the native like the friar, who led\r\nby superstitious teaching, and held the conscience by an invisible cord\r\nthrough the abstract medium of the confessional. Others opined that\r\na change in the then existing system of semi-sacerdotal Government\r\nwas desirable, if only to give scope to the budding intelligence of\r\nthe minority, which could not be suppressed.\r\n\r\nEmerging from the lowest ranks of society, with no training\r\nwhatever but that of the seminary, it was natural to suppose that\r\nthese Spanish priests would have been more capable than ambitious\r\npolitical men of the world of blending their ideas with those of the\r\nnative, and of forming closer associations with a rural population\r\nengaged in agricultural pursuits familiar to themselves in their\r\nown youth. Before the abolition of monasteries in Spain the priests\r\nwere allowed to return there after 10 years residence in the Colony;\r\nsince then they have usually entered upon their new lives for the\r\nremainder of their days, so that they naturally strove to make the\r\nbest of their social surroundings.\r\n\r\nThe Civil servant, as a rule, could feel no personal interest in\r\nhis temporary native neighbours, his hopes being centred only in\r\nrising in the Civil Service there or elsewhere--Cuba or Porto Rico,\r\nor where the ministerial wheel of fortune placed him.\r\n\r\nThe younger priests--narrow-minded and biased--those who had just\r\nentered into provincial curacies--were frequently the greater\r\nbigots. Enthusiastic in their calling, they pursued with ardour\r\ntheir mission of proselytism without experience of the world. They\r\nentered the Islands with the zeal of youth, bringing with them the\r\nimpression imparted to them in Spain, that they were sent to make\r\na moral conquest of savages. In the course of years, after repeated\r\nrebuffs, and the obligation to participate in the affairs of everyday\r\nlife in all its details, their rigidity of principle relaxed, and they\r\nbecame more tolerant towards those with whom they necessarily came\r\nin contact. They were usually taken from the peasantry and families\r\nof lowly station. As a rule they had little or no secular education,\r\nand, regarding them apart from their religious training, they might be\r\nconsidered a very ignorant class. Amongst them the Franciscan friars\r\nappeared to be the least--and the Austins the most--polished of all.\r\n\r\nThe Spanish parish priest was consulted by the native in all matters;\r\nhe was, by force of circumstances, often compelled to become an\r\narchitect,--to build the church in his adopted village--an engineer,\r\nto make or mend roads, and more frequently a doctor. His word was\r\nparamount in his parish, and in his residence he dispensed with\r\nthat stern severity of conventual discipline to which he had been\r\naccustomed in the Peninsula. Hence it was really here that his\r\nmental capacity was developed, his manners improved, and that the\r\nraw sacerdotal peasant was converted into the man of thought, study,\r\nand talent--occasionally into a gentleman. In his own vicinity,\r\nwhen isolated from European residents, he was practically the\r\nrepresentative of the Government and of the white race as well as\r\nof social order. His theological knowledge was brought to bear upon\r\nthe most mundane subjects. His thoughts necessarily expanded as the\r\nexclusiveness of his religious vocation yielded to the realization\r\nof a social position and political importance of which he had never\r\nentertained an idea in his native country.\r\n\r\nSo large was the party opposed to the continuance of priestly\r\ninfluence in the Colony that a six-months' resident would not fail\r\nto hear of the many misdeeds with which the friars in general were\r\nreproached. It would be contrary to fact to pretend that the bulk of\r\nthem supported their teaching by personal example. I was acquainted\r\nwith a great number of the friars, and their offspring too, in spite\r\nof their vow of chastity; whilst many lived in comparative luxury,\r\nnotwithstanding their vow of poverty.\r\n\r\nThere was the late parish priest of Malolos, whose son, my friend,\r\nwas a prominent lawyer. Father S----, of Bugason, had a whole family\r\nliving in his parish. An Archbishop who held the See in my time had a\r\ndaughter frequently seen on the _Paseo de Santa Lucia_; and in July,\r\n1904, two of his daughters lived in Calle Quiotan, Santa Cruz, Manila,\r\nand two others, by a different mother, in the town of O----. The\r\nlate parish priest of Lipa, Father B----, whom I knew, had a son\r\nwhom I saw in 1893. The late incumbent of Santa Cruz, Father M----\r\nL----, induced his spiritual flock to petition against his being made\r\nprior of his Order in Manila so that he should not have to leave his\r\nwomen. The late parish priest (friar) of Baliuag (Bulacan) had three\r\ndaughters and two sons. I was intimately acquainted with the latter;\r\none was a doctor of medicine and the other a planter, and they bore the\r\nsurname of Gonzalez. At Cadiz Nuevo (Negros Is.) I once danced with\r\nthe daughter of a friar (parish priest of a neighbouring village),\r\nwhilst he took another girl as his partner. I was closely acquainted,\r\nand resided more than once, with a very mixed-up family in the south\r\nof Negros Island. My host was the son of a secular clergyman, his wife\r\nand sister-in-law were the daughters of a friar, this sister-in-law was\r\nthe mistress of a friar, my host had a son who was married to another\r\nfriar's daughter, and a daughter who was the wife of a foreigner. In\r\nshort, bastards of the friars are to be found everywhere in the\r\nIslands. Regarding this merely as the natural outcome of the celibate\r\nrule, I do not criticize it, but simply wish to show that the pretended\r\nsanctity of the regular clergy in the Philippines was an absurdity,\r\nand that the monks were in no degree less frail than mankind in common.\r\n\r\nThe mysterious deaths of General Solano (August 1860) and of Zamora,\r\nthe Bishop-elect of Cebu (1873), occurred so opportunely for Philippine\r\nmonastic ambition that little doubt existed in the public mind as\r\nto who were the real criminals. When I first arrived in Manila, a\r\nquarter of a century ago, a fearful crime was still being commented\r\non. Father Piernavieja, formerly parish priest of San Miguel de\r\nMayumo, had recently committed a second murder. His first victim\r\nwas a native youth, his second a native woman _enceinte_. The public\r\nvoice could not be raised very loudly then against the priests, but\r\nthe scandal was so great that the criminal friar was sent to another\r\nprovince--Cavite--where he still celebrated the holy sacrifice of\r\nthe Eucharist. Nearly two decades afterwards--in January 1897--this\r\nrascal met with a terrible death at the hands of the rebels. He was\r\nin captivity, and having been appointed \"Bishop\" in a rebel diocese,\r\nto save his life he accepted the mock dignity; but, unfortunately for\r\nhimself, he betrayed the confidence of his captors, and collected\r\ninformation concerning their movements, plans, and strongholds for\r\nremittance to his Order. In expiation of his treason he was bound\r\nto a post under the tropical sun and left there to die. See how the\r\npublic in Spain are gulled! In a Malaga newspaper this individual was\r\nreferred to as a \"venerable figure, worthy of being placed high up on\r\nan altar, before which all Spaniards should prostrate themselves and\r\nadore him. As a _religieux_ he was a most worthy minister of the Lord;\r\nas a patriot he was a hero.\"\r\n\r\nWithin my recollection, too, a friar absconded from a Luzon Island\r\nparish with a large sum of parochial funds, and was never heard of\r\nagain. The late parish priests of Mandaloyan and Iba did the same.\r\n\r\nI well remember another interesting character of the monastic\r\nOrders. He had been parish priest in a Zambales province town, but\r\nintrigues with a _soi-disant cousine_ brought him under ecclesiastical\r\narrest at the convent of his Order in Manila. Thence he escaped, and\r\ncame over to Hong-Kong, where I made his acquaintance in 1890. He\r\ntold me he had started life in an honest way as a shoemaker's boy,\r\nbut was taken away from his trade to be placed in the seminary. His\r\nmind seemed to be a blank on any branch of study beyond shoemaking\r\nand Church ritual. He pretended that he had come over to Hong-Kong\r\nto seek work, but in reality he was awaiting his _cousine_, whom he\r\nrejoined on the way to Europe, where, I heard, he became a _garcon\r\nde cafe_ in France.\r\n\r\nIn 1893 there was another great public scandal, when the friars were\r\nopenly accused of having printed the seditious proclamations whose\r\nauthorship they attributed to the natives. The plan of the friars was\r\nto start the idea of an intended revolt, in order that they might be\r\nthe first in the field to quell it, and thus be able to again proclaim\r\nto the Home Government the absolute necessity of their continuance in\r\nthe Islands for the security of Spanish sovereignty. But the plot was\r\ndiscovered; the actual printer, a friar, mysteriously disappeared,\r\nand the courageous Gov.-General Despujols, Conde de Caspe, was,\r\nthrough monastic influence, recalled. He was very popular, and the\r\npublic manifestation of regret at his departure from the Islands was\r\npractically a protest against the Religious Orders.\r\n\r\nIn June, 1888, some cases of personal effects belonging to a friar\r\nwere consigned to the care of an intimate friend of mine, whose guest\r\nI was at the time. They had become soaked with sea-water before he\r\nreceived them, and a neighbouring priest requested him to open the\r\npackages and do what he could to save the contents. I assisted my\r\nfriend in this task, and amongst the friar's personal effects we\r\nwere surprised to find, intermixed with prayer-books, scapularies,\r\nmissals, prints of saints, etc., about a dozen most disgustingly\r\nobscene double-picture slides for a stereoscope. What an entertainment\r\nfor a guide in morals! This same friar had held a vicarage before\r\nin another province, but having become an habitual drunkard, he was\r\nremoved to Manila, and there appointed a confessor. From Manila he\r\nhad just been again sent to take charge of the _cure of souls_.\r\n\r\nI knew a money-grabbing parish priest--a friar--who publicly announced\r\nraffles from the pulpit of the church from which he preached morality\r\nand devotion. On one occasion a 200-peso watch was put up for P500--at\r\nanother time he raffled dresses for the women. Under the pretext of\r\nbeing a pious institution, he established a society of women, called\r\nthe Association of St. Joseph (_Confradia de San Jose_), upon whom\r\nhe imposed the very secular duties of domestic service in the convent\r\nand raffle-ticket hawking. He had the audacity to dictate to a friend\r\nof mine--a planter--the value of the gifts he was to make to him,\r\nand when the planter was at length wearied of his importunities,\r\nhe conspired with a Spaniard to deprive my friend of his estate,\r\nalleging that he was not the real owner. Failing in this, he stirred\r\nup the petty-governor and headmen against him. The petty-governor was\r\nurged to litigation, and when he received an unfavourable sentence,\r\nthe priest, enraged at the abortive result of his malicious intrigues,\r\nactually left his vicarage to accompany his litigious _protege_ to the\r\nchief judge of the province in quest of a reversion of the sentence.\r\n\r\nA priest of evil propensities brought only misery to his parish and\r\naroused a feeling of odium against the Spanish friars in general. As\r\nincumbents they held the native in contempt. He who should be the\r\nparishioner was treated despotically as the subject whose life,\r\nliberty, property, and civil rights were in his sacerdotal lord's\r\npower. And that power was not unfrequently exercised, for if a\r\nnative refused to yield to his demands, or did not contribute with\r\nsufficient liberality to a religious feast, or failed to come to\r\nMass, or protected the virtue of his daughter, or neglected the\r\ngenuflexion and kissing of hands, or was out of the priest's party in\r\nthe municipal affairs of the parish, or in any other trivial way became\r\na _persona non grata_ at the \"convent,\" he and his family would become\r\nthe pastor's sheep marked for sacrifice. As Government agent it was\r\nwithin his arbitrary power to attach his signature to or withhold it\r\nfrom any municipal document. From time to time he could give full vent\r\nto his animosity by secretly denouncing to the civil authorities as\r\n\"inconvenient in the town\" all those whom he wished to get rid of. He\r\nhad simply to send an official advice to the Governor of the province,\r\nwho forwarded it to the Gov.-General, stating that he had reason\r\nto believe that the persons mentioned in the margin were disloyal,\r\nimmoral, or whatever it might be, and recommend their removal from\r\nthe neighbourhood. A native so named suddenly found at his door a\r\npatrol of the Civil Guard, who escorted him, with his elbows tied\r\ntogether, from prison to prison, up to the capital town and thence to\r\nManila. Finally, without trial or sentence, he was banished to some\r\ndistant island of the Archipelago. He might one day return to find\r\nhis family ruined, or he might as often spend his last days in misery\r\nalone. Sometimes a native who had privately heard of his \"denunciation\"\r\nbecame a _remontado_, that is to say he fled to the mountains to lead a\r\nbandits life where the evils of a debased civilization could not reach\r\nhim. Banishment in these circumstances was not a mere transportation\r\nto another place, but was attended with all the horrors of a cruel\r\ncaptivity, of which I have been an eye-witness. From the foregoing\r\nit may be readily understood how the conduct of the regular clergy\r\nwas the primary cause of the Rebellion of 1896; it was not the monks'\r\nimmorality which disturbed the mind of the native, but their Caesarism\r\nwhich raised his ire. The ground of discord was always infinitely more\r\nmaterial than sentimental. Among the friars, however, there were many\r\nexceptional men of charming manners and eminent virtue. If little was\r\ndone to coerce the bulk of the friars to live up to the standard of\r\nthese exceptions, it was said to be because the general interests of\r\nMother Church were opposed to investigation and admonition, for fear\r\nof the consequent scandal destructive of her prestige.\r\n\r\nThe Hierarchy of the Philippines consists of one Archbishop in Manila,\r\nand four Suffragan Bishoprics, respectively of Nueva Segovia, Cebu,\r\nJaro, and Nueva Caceres. [90] The provincials, the vicars-general,\r\nand other officers of the Religious Orders were elected by the\r\nChapters and held office for four years. The first Bishop of Manila\r\ntook possession in 1581, and the first Archbishop in 1598.\r\n\r\nThe Jesuits came to these Islands in 1581, and were expelled therefrom\r\nin 1770 by virtue of an Apostolic Brief [91] of Pope Clement XIV.,\r\nbut were permitted to return in 1859, on the understanding that\r\nthey would confine their labours to scholastic education and the\r\nestablishment of missions amongst uncivilized tribes. Consequently,\r\nin Manila they refounded their school--the Municipal Athenaeum--a\r\nmission house, and a Meteorological Observatory, whilst in many parts\r\nof Mindanao Island they have established missions, with the vain hope\r\nof converting Mahometans to Christianity. [92] The Jesuits, compared\r\nwith the members of the other Orders, are very superior men, and their\r\nfraternity includes a few, and almost the only, learned ecclesiastics\r\nwho came to the Colony. Since their return to the Islands (1859)\r\nin the midst of the strife with the Religious Orders, the people\r\nrecognized the Jesuits as disinterested benefactors of the country.\r\n\r\nSeveral Chinese have been admitted to holy orders, two of them\r\nhaving become Austin Friars. [93] The first native friars date their\r\nadmission from the year 1700, since when there have been sixteen of\r\nthe Order of St. Augustine. Subsequently they were excluded from the\r\nconfraternities, and only admitted to holy orders as vicars, curates\r\nto assist parish vicars, chaplains, and in other minor offices. Up\r\nto the year 1872 native priests were appointed to benefices, but in\r\nconsequence of their alleged implication in the Cavite Conspiracy of\r\nthat year, their church livings, as they became vacant, were given\r\nto Spanish friars, whose headquarters were established in Manila.\r\n\r\nThe _Austin Friars_ were the religious pioneers in these Islands;\r\nthey came to Cebu in 1565 and to Manila in 1571; then followed the\r\n_Franciscans_ in 1577; the _Dominicans_ in 1587, a member of this\r\nOrder having been ordained first Bishop of Manila, where he arrived\r\nin 1581. The _Recoletos_ (unshod Augustinians), a branch of the Saint\r\nAugustine Order, came to the Islands in 1606; the _Capuchins_--the\r\nlowest type of European monk in the Far East, came to Manila in 1886,\r\nand were sent to the Caroline Islands (_vide_ p. 45). The _Paulists_,\r\nof the Order of Saint Vincent de Paul, were employed in scholastic\r\nwork in Nueva Caceres, Jaro, and Cebu, the same as the Jesuits were\r\nin Manila. The _Benedictines_ came to the Islands in 1895. Only the\r\nmembers of the first four Orders above named were parish priests,\r\nand each (except the _Franciscans_) possessed agricultural land;\r\nhence the animosity of the natives was directed against these\r\nfour confraternities only, and not against the others, who neither\r\nmonopolized incumbencies, nor held rural property, but were simply\r\nteachers, or missionaries, whose worldly interests in no way clashed\r\nwith those of the people. Therefore, whenever there was a popular\r\noutcry against \"the friars,\" it was understood to refer solely to\r\nthe Austins, the Franciscans, the Dominicans and the Recoletos. [94]\r\nThere was no Spanish secular clergy in the Islands, except three or\r\nfour military chaplains.\r\n\r\nThe Church was financially supported by the State to the extent of\r\nabout three-quarters of a million pesos per annum.\r\n\r\nThe following are some of the most interesting items taken from\r\n\"The Budget for 1888,\" viz.:--\r\n\r\n\r\n    _Sanctorum_ or Church tax of 18 3/4 cents (i.e., 1 1/2 reales)\r\n    on each _Cedula personal_, say on 2,760,613 Cedulas in 1888,\r\n    less 4 per cent, cost of collection                 P496,910.00\r\n\r\n\r\nThe friars appointed to incumbencies received in former times tithes\r\nfrom the Spaniards, and a Church tax from the natives computed by the\r\namount of tribute paid. Tithe payment (_diezmos prediales_) by the\r\nSpaniards became almost obsolete, and the _Sanctorum_ tax on _Cedulas_\r\nwas paid to the Church through the Treasury (_vide_ p. 55).\r\n\r\nThere were priests in missions and newly-formed parishes where the\r\ndomiciled inhabitants were so few that the _Sanctorum_ tax on the\r\naggregate of the _Cedulas_ was insufficient for their support. These\r\nmissionaries were allowed salaries, and parish priests were permitted\r\nto appropriate from their revenues, as annual stipend, amounts ranging\r\nfrom 500 to 800 pesos, as a rule, with a few exceptions (such as\r\nBinondo parish and others), rated at 1,200 pesos, whilst one, at\r\nleast (the parish priest, or missionary of Vergara, Davao Province),\r\nreceived 2,200 pesos a year. In practice, however, a great many parish\r\npriests spent far more than their allotted stipends.\r\n\r\nA project was under consideration to value the incumbencies, and\r\nclassify them, like the Courts of Justice (_vide_ p. 234), with the\r\nview of apportioning to each a fixed income payable by the Treasury\r\nin lieu of accounting to the Church for the exact amount of the\r\n_Sanctorum_.\r\n\r\nBy decree of Gov.-General Terrero, dated November 23,1885, the\r\nState furnished free labour (by natives who did not pay poll-tax)\r\nfor Church architectural works, provided it was made clear that the\r\ncost of such labour could not be covered by the surplus funds of the\r\n_Sanctorum_. The chief items of Church expenditure were as follows,\r\nviz.:--\r\n\r\n\r\n                    _State outlay for Church._\r\n                                                            P. cts.\r\n\r\nArchbishop's salary                                       12,000 00\r\nOther salaries (Cathedral)                                40,300 00\r\nOther expenses (Cathedral)                                 3,000 00\r\nFour Bishops, each with a salary of P6,000                24,000 00\r\nCourt of Arches (amount contributed by the State [95])     5,000 00\r\nChaplain of Los Banos                                        120 00\r\nSulu Mission                                               1,000 00\r\nMission House in Manila for Capuchin friars                1,700 00\r\n12 Capuchins (State paid) for the Caroline and Pelew\r\nIslands--6 at P300 and 6 at P500 each per annum            4,800 00\r\nTransport of Missionaries estimated at about, per annum   10,000 00\r\nThe anticipated _total_ State outlay for the support of\r\nthe Church, Missions, Monasteries, Convents, etc.,\r\n_including the above and all other items_ for the\r\nfinancial year of 1888 was                              P724,634 50\r\n\r\n\r\nMoreover, the religious Corporations possessed large private\r\nrevenues. The Dominicans' investments in Hong-Kong, derived from\r\ncapitalized income, are still considerable. The Austin, Recoleto,\r\nand Dominican friars held very valuable real estate in the provinces,\r\nwhich was rented to the native agriculturists on conditions which the\r\ntenants considered onerous. The native planters were discontented with\r\nthe treatment they received from these landowners, and their numerous\r\ncomplaints formed part of the general outcry against the regular\r\nclergy. The bailiffs of these corporation lands were unordained\r\nbrothers of the Order. They resided in the Estate Houses, and by\r\ncourtesy were styled \"fathers\" by the natives. They were under certain\r\nreligious vows, but not being entitled to say Mass, they were termed\r\n\"legos,\" or ignorant men, by their own Order.\r\n\r\nThe clergy also derived a very large portion of their incomes from\r\ncommissions on the sale of _cedulas_, sales of Papal Bulls, masses,\r\npictures, books, chaplets and indulgences, marriage, burial and\r\nbaptismal fees, benedictions, donations touted for after the crops\r\nwere raised, legacies to be paid for in masses, remains of wax candles\r\nleft in the church by the faithful, fees for getting souls out of\r\npurgatory, alms, etc. The surplus revenues over and above parochial\r\nrequirements were supposed to augment the common Church funds in\r\nManila. The Corporations were consequently immensely wealthy, and\r\ntheir power and influence were in consonance with that wealth.\r\n\r\nEach Order had its procurator in Madrid, who took up the cudgels in\r\ndefence of his Corporation's interest in the Philippines whenever\r\nthis was menaced. On the other hand, the Church, as a body politic,\r\ndispensed no charity, but received all. It was always begging; always\r\nabove civil laws and taxes; claimed immunity, proclaimed poverty,\r\nand inculcated in others charity to itself.\r\n\r\nMost of the parish priests--Spanish or native--were very hospitable\r\nto travellers, and treated them with great kindness. Amongst them\r\nthere were some few misanthropes and churlish characters who did not\r\ncare to be troubled by anything outside the region of their vocation,\r\nbut on the whole I found them remarkably complaisant.\r\n\r\nIn Spain there were training colleges of the three Communities, in\r\nValladolid, Ocana, and Monte Agudo respectively, for young novices\r\nintended to be sent to the Philippines, the last Spanish Colony where\r\nfriars held vicarages.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe ecclesiastical archives of the Philippines abound with proofs of\r\nthe bitter and tenacious strife sustained, not only between the civil\r\nand Church authorities, but even amongst the religious communities\r\nthemselves. Each Order was so intensely jealous of the others, that\r\none is almost led to ponder whether the final goal of all could have\r\nbeen identical. All voluntarily faced death with the same incentive,\r\nwhilst amicable fellowship in this world seemed an impossibility. The\r\nfirst Bishop (_vide_ p. 56) struggled in vain to create a religious\r\nmonopoly in the Philippines for the exclusive benefit of the\r\nAugustine Order. It has been shown how ardent was the hatred which\r\nthe Jesuits and the other Religious Orders mutually entertained for\r\neach other. Each sacred fraternity laboured incessantly to gain the\r\nascendancy in the conquered territories, and their Divine calling\r\nserved for nothing in palliating the acrimony of their reciprocal\r\naccusations and recriminations, which often involved the civil power.\r\n\r\nFor want of space I can only refer to a few of these disputes.\r\n\r\nThe Austin friars attributed to the Jesuits the troubles with the\r\nMahometans of Mindanao and Sulu, and, in their turn, the Jesuits\r\nprotested against what they conceived to be the bad policy of\r\nthe Government, adopted under the influence of the other Orders in\r\nManila. So distinct were their interests that the Augustine chroniclers\r\nrefer to the other Orders as _different religions_.\r\n\r\nIn 1778 the Province of Pangasinan was spiritually administered by the\r\nDominicans, whilst that of Zambales was allotted to the Recoletos. The\r\nDominicans, therefore, proposed to the Recoletos to cede Zambales\r\nto them, because it was repugnant to have to pass through Recoleto\r\nterritory going from Manila to their own province! The Recoletos\r\nwere offered Mindoro Island in exchange, which they refused, until\r\nthe Archbishop compelled them to yield. Disturbances then arose in\r\nZambales, the responsibility of which was thrown on the Dominicans by\r\ntheir rival Order, and the Recoletos finally succeeded in regaining\r\ntheir old province by intrigue.\r\n\r\nDuring the Governorship of Martin de Urena, Count de Lizarraga\r\n(1709-15), the Aragonese and Castilian priests quarrelled about the\r\necclesiastical preferments.\r\n\r\nAt the beginning of the 18th century the Bishop-elect of Cebu, Fray\r\nPedro Saez de la Vega Lanzaverde, refused to take possession because\r\nthe nomination was _in partibus_. He objected also that the Bishopric\r\nwas merely one in perspective and not yet a reality. The See remained\r\nvacant whilst the contumacious priest lived in Mexico. Fray Sebastian\r\nde Jorronda was subsequently appointed to administer the Bishopric,\r\nbut also refused, until he was coerced into submission by the Supreme\r\nCourt (1718).\r\n\r\nIn 1767 the Austin friars refused to admit the episcopal visits, and\r\nexhibited such a spirit of independence that Pope Benedict XIV. was\r\nconstrained to issue a Bull to exhort them to obey, admonishing them\r\nfor their insubordination.\r\n\r\nThe friars of late years were subject to a visiting priest--the\r\nProvincial--in all matters _de vita et moribus_, to the Bishop of\r\nthe diocese in all affairs of spiritual dispensation, and to the\r\nGov.-General as vice-royal patron in all that concerned the relations\r\nof the Church to the Civil Government. [96]\r\n\r\nAn observant traveller, unacquainted with the historical antecedents\r\nof the friars in the Philippines, could not fail to be impressed by the\r\nestrangement of religious men, whose sacred mission, if genuine, ought\r\nto have formed an inseverable bond of alliance and goodfellowship.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIII\r\n\r\nSpanish Insular Government\r\n\r\n\r\nFrom the days of Legaspi the supreme rule in these Islands was usually\r\nconfided for indefinite periods to military men: but circumstances\r\nfrequently placed naval officers, magistrates, the Supreme Court,\r\nand even ecclesiastics at the head of the local government. During the\r\nlast half century of Spanish rule the common practice was to appoint\r\na Lieut.-General as Governor, with the local rank of Captain-General\r\npending his three-years' term of office. An exception to this rule in\r\nthat period was made (1883-85) when Joaquin Jovellar, a Captain-General\r\nand ex-War Minster in Spain, was specially empowered to establish some\r\nnotable reforms--the good policy of which was doubtful. Again, in 1897,\r\nFernando Primo de Rivera, Marquis de Estella, also a Captain-General\r\nin Spain, held office in Manila under the exceptional circumstances\r\nof the Tagalog Rebellion of 1896, in succession to Ramon Blanco,\r\nMarquis de Pena Plata. Considering that Primo de Rivera, during his\r\nprevious Gov.-Generalship (1880-83), had won great popularity with\r\nthe Filipinos, he was deemed, in Madrid, to be the man most capable\r\nof arresting the revolutionary movement. How far the confidence of\r\nthe Home Government was misplaced will be seen in Chapter xxii.\r\n\r\nSoon after the conquest the Colony was divided and sub-divided into\r\nprovinces and military districts as they gradually yielded to the\r\nSpanish sway. Such districts, called _Encomiendas_, [97] were then\r\nfarmed out to _Encomenderos_, who exercised little scruple in their\r\nrigorous exactions from the natives. Some of the _Encomenderos_\r\nacquired wealth during the terms of their holdings, whilst others\r\nbecame victims to the revenge of their subjects. They must indeed\r\nhave been bold, enterprising men who, in those days, would have taken\r\ncharge of districts distant from the capital. It would appear that\r\ntheir tenure was, in a certain sense, feudal, for they were frequently\r\ncalled upon to aid the Central Government with vessels, men, and arms\r\nagainst the attacks of common enemies. Against Mahometan incursions\r\nnecessity made them warriors,--if they were not so by taste,--civil\r\nengineers to open communications with their districts, administrators,\r\njudges, and all that represented social order. _Encomiendas_ were\r\nsometimes given to Spaniards as rewards for high services rendered\r\nto the commonwealth, [98] although favouritism or (in later years)\r\npurchase-money more commonly secured the vacancies, and the holders\r\nwere quite expected to make fortunes in the manner they thought fit,\r\nwith due regard for the Royal Treasury (_vide_ p. 54).\r\n\r\nThe _Encomenderos_ were, in the course of time, superseded by\r\nJudicial Governors, called _Alcaldes_, who received small salaries,\r\nfrom L60 per annum and upwards, but were allowed to trade. The\r\nright to trade--called \"_indulto de comercio_\"--was sold to the\r\n_Alcalde-Governors_, except those of Tondo, [99] Zamboanga, Cavite,\r\nNueva Ecija, Islas Batanes and Antique, whose trading right was\r\nincluded in the emoluments of office. The Government's object was\r\neconomy.\r\n\r\nIn 1840 Eusebio Mazorca wrote thus [100]:--\"The salary paid to the\r\nchiefs of provinces who enjoy the right of trade is more or less P300\r\nper annum, and after deducting the amount paid for the trading right,\r\nwhich in some provinces amounts to five-sixths of the whole--as in\r\nPangasinan; and in others to the whole of the salary--as in Caraga;\r\nand discounting again the taxes, it is not possible to conceive how\r\nthe appointment can be so much sought after. There are candidates up\r\nto the grade of brigadier who relinquish a P3,000 salary to pursue\r\ntheir hopes and projects in governorship.\"\r\n\r\nThis system obtained for many years, and the abuses went on\r\nincreasing. The _Alcaldes_ practically monopolized the trade of their\r\ndistricts, unduly taking advantage of their governmental position to\r\nhinder the profitable traffic of the natives and bring it all into\r\ntheir own hands. They tolerated no competition; they arbitrarily\r\nfixed their own purchasing prices, and sold at current rates. Due to\r\nthe scarcity of silver in the interior, the natives often paid their\r\ntribute to the Royal Treasury in produce,--chiefly rice,--which was\r\nreceived into the Royal Granaries at a ruinously low valuation, and\r\naccounted for to the State at its real value; the difference being the\r\nillicit profit made by the _Alcalde_. Many of these functionaries\r\nexercised their power most despotically in their own circuits,\r\ndisposing of the natives' labour and chattels without remuneration,\r\nand not unfrequently, for their own ends, invoking the King's name,\r\nwhich imbued the native with a feeling of awe, as if His Majesty were\r\nsome supernatural being.\r\n\r\nIn 1810 Tomas de Comyn wrote as follows:--\"In order to be a chief\r\nof a province in these Islands, no training or knowledge or special\r\nservices are necessary; all persons are fit and admissible.... It is\r\nquite a common thing to see a barber or a Governor's lackey, a sailor\r\nor a deserter, suddenly transformed into an Alcalde, Administrator,\r\nand Captain of the forces of a populous province without any counsellor\r\nbut his rude understanding, or any guide but his passions.\" [101]\r\n\r\nBy Royal Decree of 1844 Government officials were thenceforth strictly\r\nprohibited to trade, under pain of removal from office.\r\n\r\nIn the year 1850 there were 34 Provinces, and two Political Military\r\nCommandancies. Until June, 1886, the offices of provincial Civil\r\nGovernor and Chief Judge of that province were vested in the same\r\nperson--the _Alcalde Mayor_. This created a strange anomaly, for an\r\nappeal against an edict of the Governor had to be made to himself\r\nas Judge. Then if it were taken to the central authority in Manila,\r\nit was sent back for \"information\" to the Judge-Governor, without\r\nindependent inquiry being made in the first instance; hence protest\r\nagainst his acts was fruitless.\r\n\r\nDuring the Regency of Queen Maria Christina, this curious arrangement\r\nwas abolished by a Decree dated in Madrid, February 26, 1886, to take\r\neffect on June 1 following.\r\n\r\nEighteen Civil Governorships were created, and _Alcaldes'_ functions\r\nwere confined to their judgeships; moreover, the Civil Governor was\r\nassisted by a Secretary, so that two new official posts were created\r\nin each of these provinces.\r\n\r\nThe Archipelago, including Sulu, was divided into 19 Civil Provincial\r\nGovernments, four Military General Divisions, 43 Military Provincial\r\nDistricts, and four Provincial Governments under Naval Officers,\r\nforming a total of 70 Divisions and Sub-Divisions.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCOST OF SPANISH ADMINISTRATION\r\n\r\n                                                            P. cts.\r\n\r\nThe Gov.-General received a salary of                   40,000 00\r\n\r\nThe Central Government Office, called \"_Gobierno\r\nGeneral_,\" with its Staff of Officials and all\r\nexpenses                                                43,708 00\r\n\r\nThe General Government Centre was assisted in the\r\nGeneral Administration of the Islands by two other\r\nGoverning Bodies, namely:\r\n\r\n    The General Direction of Civil Administration       29,277 34\r\n\r\n    The Administrative Council                          28,502 00\r\n\r\nThe Chief of the General Direction received a salary of P12,000, with\r\nan allowance for official visits to the Provinces of P500 per annum.\r\n\r\nThe Council was composed of three Members, each at a salary of P4,700,\r\nbesides a Secretary and officials.\r\n\r\nSeventy divisions and sub-divisions as follows, viz.:--\r\n\r\n\r\nCIVIL GOVERNMENTS\r\n\r\n\r\nManila Pce\r\nSalary of Civil Governor P5,000 Total Cost.             20,248 00\r\n\r\nAlday, Batangas, Bulacan, Ilocos Norte, Ilocos Sur,\r\nLa Laguna, Pampanga, Pangasinan.\r\nEight First-Class Govts.:\r\n        Salary of each Civil Gov.

A Civil Governor was the\r\nrepresentative of the Gov.-General, whose orders and decrees he had to\r\npublish and execute at his own discretion. He could not absent himself\r\nfrom his province without permission. He had to maintain order, veto\r\npetitions for arms' licences, hold under his orders and dispose of the\r\nCivil Guard, Carabineers, and local guards. He could suspend the pay\r\nfor ten days of any subordinate official who failed to do his duty,\r\nor he could temporarily suspend him in his functions with justifiable\r\ncause, and propose to the Gov.-General his definite removal. He had to\r\npreside at all municipal elections; to bring delinquents to justice;\r\nto decree the detention on suspicion of any individual, and place him\r\nat the disposal of the chief judge within three days after his capture;\r\nto dictate orders for the government of the towns and villages; to\r\nexplain to the petty-governors the true interpretation of the law\r\nand regulations affecting their districts.\r\n\r\nThe Governor was chief of police, and could impose fines up to P50\r\nwithout the intervention of judicial authority; and in the event of the\r\nmulcted person being unable to pay, he could order his imprisonment\r\nat the rate of one day's detention for each half-peso of the fine;\r\nit was provided, however, that the imprisonment could not exceed\r\n30 days in any case. He had to preside at the ballot for military\r\nconscription, but he could delegate this duty to his Secretary, or,\r\nfailing him, to the Administrator. Where no harbour-master had been\r\nappointed, the Civil Governor acted as such. He had the care of the\r\nprimary instruction; and it was his duty specially to see that the\r\nnative scholars were taught the Spanish language. Land concessions,\r\nimprovements tending to increase the wealth of the province, permits\r\nfor felling timber, and the collection of excise taxes were all\r\nunder his care. He had also to furnish statistics relating to the\r\nlabour poll-tax; draw up the provincial budget; render provincial\r\nand municipal accounts, etc., all of which had to be counter-signed\r\nunder the word _Intervine_ by the Secretary. He was provincial\r\npostmaster-general, chief of telegraph service, prisons, charities,\r\nboard of health, public works, woods and forests, mines, agriculture\r\nand industry. Under no circumstances could he dispose of the public\r\nfunds, which were in the care of the Administrator and Interventor, and\r\nhe was not entitled to any percentages (as _Alcalde-Governors_ formerly\r\nwere), or any emoluments whatsoever further than his fixed salary.\r\n\r\nA Governor had to be a Spaniard over 30 years of age. It is curious to\r\nnote, from its political significance, that among the many classes of\r\npersons eligible for a Civil Governorship were those who had been\r\nMembers of the Spanish Parliament or Senate during one complete\r\nsession.\r\n\r\nUpon the whole, a Provincial Governor passed life very comfortably\r\nif he did not go out of his way to oppress his subjects and create\r\ndiscord. His tranquillity, nevertheless, was always dependent upon his\r\nmaintaining a good understanding with the priesthood of his district,\r\nand his conformity with the demands of the friars. If he had the\r\nmisfortune to cross their path, it brought him a world of woe, and\r\nfinally his downfall. There have been Provincial Governors who in\r\nreality held their posts by clerical influence, whilst others who\r\nexercised a more independent spirit--who set aside Church interests\r\nto serve those of the State, with which they were intrusted--fell\r\nvictims to sacerdotal intrigue; for the subordinates of the hierarchy\r\nhad power to overthrow as well as to support those who were appointed\r\nto their districts. Few improvements appear to have been made in the\r\nprovinces by the initiative of the local Governors, nor did they\r\nseem to take any special interest in commercial and agricultural\r\nadvancement. This lack of interest was somewhat excusable and\r\ncomprehensible, however, seeing that after they were appointed, and\r\neven though they governed well within the strict limitations of their\r\noffice, they were constantly expecting that a ministerial change or the\r\nfall of a single minister might remove them from their posts, or that\r\nthe undermining influence of favouritism might succeed in accomplishing\r\ntheir withdrawal. It was natural, therefore, that they should have\r\nbeen indifferent about the fostering of new agricultural enterprises,\r\nof opening tracks for bringing down timber, of facilitating trade,\r\nor of in any way stimulating the development of the resources of a\r\nprovince when the probability existed that they would never have the\r\npersonal satisfaction of seeing the result of their efforts.\r\n\r\nSome Governors with whom I am personally acquainted have, in spite of\r\nall discouragement, studied the wants of their provinces, but to no\r\npurpose. Their estimates for road-making and mending, bridge-building,\r\nand public works generally were shelved in Manila, whilst the local\r\nfunds (_Fondos locales_), which ought to have been expended in the\r\nlocalities where they were collected, were seized by the authorities\r\nin the capital and applied to other purposes.\r\n\r\nAn annual statement of one province will be sufficient, as an example,\r\nto illustrate the nature of this local tax:--\r\n\r\n\r\nLOCAL FUNDS [103]--ALBAY PROVINCE\r\n\r\n\r\nProvincial Revenue\r\n\r\n                                             P. cts.

If a bridge broke down so it remained for years,\r\nwhilst thousands of travellers had to wade through the river unless\r\na raft were put there at the expense of the very poorest people by\r\norder of the petty-governor of the nearest village. The \"Tribunal,\"\r\nwhich served the double purpose of Town Hall and Dak Bungalow for\r\nwayfarers, was often a hut of bamboo and palm-leaves, whilst others,\r\nwhich had been decent buildings generations gone by, lapsed into\r\na wretched state of dilapidation. In some villages there was no\r\nTribunal at all, and the official business had to be transacted in\r\nthe municipal Governor's house. I first visited Calamba (La Laguna)\r\nin 1880, and for 14 years, to my knowledge, the headmen had to meet\r\nin a sugar-store in lieu of a Tribunal. In San Jose de Buenavista,\r\nthe capital town of Antique Province, the Town Hall was commenced in\r\ngood style and left half finished during 15 years. Either some one\r\nfor pity's sake, or the headmen for their own convenience, went to\r\nthe expense of thatching over half the unfinished structure, which\r\nwas therefore saved from entire ruin, whilst all but the stone walls\r\nof the other half rotted away. So it continued until 1887, when the\r\nGovernment authorized a partial restoration of this building.\r\n\r\nAs to the roads connecting the villages, quite 20 per cent. of them\r\nserve only for travellers on foot, on horse or on buffalo back at\r\nany time, and in the wet season certainly 60 per cent, of all the\r\nPhilippine highways are in too bad a state for any kind of passenger\r\nconveyance to pass with safety. In the wet season, many times I\r\nhave made a sea journey in a prahu, simply because the highroad near\r\nthe coast had become a mud-track, for want of macadamized stone and\r\ndrainage, and only serviceable for transport by buffalo. In the dry\r\nseason the sun mended the roads, and the traffic over the baked clods\r\nreduced them more or less to dust, so that vehicles could pass. Private\r\nproperty-owners expended much time and money in the preservation of\r\npublic roads, although a curious law existed prohibiting repairs to\r\nhighways by non-official persons.\r\n\r\nEvery male adult inhabitant (with certain specified exceptions) had to\r\ngive the State fifteen days' labour per annum, or redeem that labour\r\nby payment. Of course thousands of the most needy class preferred to\r\ngive their fifteen days. This labour and the redemption-money were\r\nonly theoretically employed in local improvements. This system was\r\nreformed in 1884 (_vide_ p. 224).\r\n\r\nThe Budget for 1888 showed the trivial sum of P120,000 to be used\r\nin road-making and mending in the whole Archipelago. It provided\r\nfor a Chief Inspector of Public Works with a salary of P6,500,\r\naided by a staff composed of 48 technical and 82 non-technical\r\nsubordinates. As a matter of fact, the Provincial and District\r\nGovernors often received intimation not to encourage the employment\r\nof labour for local improvements, but to press the labouring-class\r\nto pay the redemption-tax to swell the central coffers, regardless\r\nof the corresponding misery, discomfort, and loss to trade in the\r\ninterior. But labour at the Governor's disposal was not alone\r\nsufficient. There was no fund from which to defray the cost of\r\nmaterials; or, if these could be found without payment, some one must\r\npay for the transport by buffaloes and carts and find the implements\r\nfor the labourers' use. How could hands alone repair a bridge which\r\nhad rotted away? To cut a log of wood for the public service would\r\nhave necessitated communications with the Inspection of Woods and\r\nForests and other centres and many months' delay.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe system of controlling the action of one public servant by\r\nappointing another under him to supervise his work has always found\r\nfavour in Spain, and was adopted in this Colony. There were a great\r\nmany Government employments of the kind which were merely sinecures. In\r\nmany cases the pay was small, it is true, but the labour was often of\r\nproportionately smaller value than that pay. With very few exceptions,\r\nall the Government Offices in Manila were closed to the public\r\nduring half the ordinary working-day,--the afternoon,--and many of\r\nthe Civil Service officials made their appearance at their desks\r\nabout ten o'clock in the morning, retiring shortly after mid-day,\r\nwhen they had smoked their habitual number of cigarettes.\r\n\r\nThe crowd of office-seekers were indifferent to the fact that\r\nthe true source of national vigour is the spirit of individual\r\nself-dependence. Constant clamour for Government employment tends\r\nonly to enfeeble individual effort, and destroys the stimulus, or\r\nwhat is of greater worth, the necessity of acting for one's self. The\r\nSpaniard (except the Basque and the Catalonian) looks to the Government\r\nfor active and direct aid, as if the Public Treasury were a natural\r\nspring at the waters of which all temporal calamities could be washed\r\naway--all material wants supplied. He will tell you with pride rather\r\nthan with abashment that he is an _empleado_--a State dependent.\r\n\r\nNational progress is but the aggregate of personal individual\r\nactivity rightly directed, and a nation weakens as a whole as its\r\ncomponent parts become dormant, or as the majority rely upon the\r\nefforts of the few. The spirit of Caesarism--\"all for the people and\r\nnothing by them\"--must tend not only to political slavery, but to a\r\nreduction in commercial prosperity, national power, and international\r\ninfluence. The Spaniards have indeed proved this fact. The best laws\r\nwere never intended to provide for the people, but to regulate the\r\nconditions on which they could provide for themselves. The consumers\r\nof public wealth in Spain are far too numerous in proportion to the\r\nproducers; hence not only is the State constantly pressed for funds,\r\nbut the busy bees who form the nucleus of the nation's vitality are\r\nheavily taxed to provide for the dependent office-seeking drones. It\r\nis the fatal delusion that liberty and national welfare depend solely\r\nupon good government, instead of good government depending upon united\r\nand co-operative individual exertion, that has brought the Spanish\r\nnation to its present state of deplorable impotence.\r\n\r\nThe Government itself is but the official counterpart of the\r\ngoverned. By the aid of servile speculators, a man in political\r\ncircles struggles to come to the front--to hold a portfolio in the\r\nministry--if it only be for a session, when his pension for life is\r\nassured on his retirement. Merit and ability have little weight, and\r\nthe proteges of the outgoing minister must make room for those of the\r\nnext lucky ministerial pension-seeker, and so on successively. This\r\nColony therefore became a lucrative hunting-ground at the disposal\r\nof the Madrid Cabinet wherein to satisfy the craving demands of their\r\nnumerous partisans and friends. They were sent out with a salary and to\r\nmake what they could,--at their own risk, of course,--like the country\r\nlad who was sent up to London with the injunction from his father,\r\n\"Make money, honestly if you can, but make it.\"\r\n\r\nFrom the Conquest up to 1844, when trading by officials was abolished,\r\nit was a matter of little public concern how Government servants made\r\nfortunes. Only when the jealousy of one urged him to denounce another\r\nwas any inquiry instituted so long as the official was careful not to\r\nembezzle or commit a direct fraud on the _Real Haber_ (the Treasury\r\nfunds). When the _Real Haber_ was once covered, then all that could\r\nbe got out of the Colony was for the benefit of the officials, great\r\nand small. In 1840, Eusebio Mazorca wrote as follows: [104]--\"Each\r\nchief of a province is a real sultan, and when he has terminated his\r\nadministration, all that is talked of in the capital is the thousands\r\nof pesos clear gain which he made in his Government.\"\r\n\r\nEusebio Mazorca further states: [105]--\"The Governor receives payment\r\nof the tribute in rice-paddy, which he credits to the native at two\r\nreales in silver per caban. Then he pays this sum into the Royal\r\nTreasury in money, and sells the rice-paddy for private account at\r\nthe current rate of six, eight or more reales in silver per caban,\r\nand this simple operation brings him 200 to 300 per cent. profit.\"\r\n\r\nThe same writer adds:--\"Now quite recently the Interventor of Zamboanga\r\nis accused by the Governor of that place of having made some P15,000\r\nto P16,000 solely by using false measures ... The same Interventor to\r\nwhom I refer, is said to have made a fortune of P50,000 to P60,000,\r\nwhilst his salary as second official in the Audit Department [106]\r\nis P540 per annum.\" According to Zuniga, the salary of a professor\r\nof law with the rank of magistrate was P800 per annum.\r\n\r\nUp to June, 1886, the provincial taxes being in the custody of the\r\nAdministrator, the Judicial Governor had a percentage assigned to him\r\nto induce him to control the Administrator's work. The Administrator\r\nhimself had percentages, and the accounts of these two functionaries\r\nwere checked by a third individual styled the \"Interventor,\" whose\r\nduties appeared to be to intervene in the casting-up of his superiors'\r\nfigures. He was forbidden to reside with the Administrator. After\r\nthe above date the payment of all these percentages ceased.\r\n\r\nBut for the peculations by Government officials from the highest\r\ncircles downwards, the inhabitants of the Colony would doubtless\r\nhave been a million or so richer per annum. One frequently heard\r\nof officials leaving for Spain with sums far exceeding the total\r\nemoluments they had received during their term of office. Some\r\nprovincial employees acquired a pernicious habit of annexing what\r\nwas not theirs by all manner of pretexts. To cite some instances:\r\nI knew a Governor of Negros Island who seldom saw a native pass the\r\nGovernment House with a good horse without begging it of him; thus,\r\nunder fear of his avenging a refusal, his subjects furnished him\r\nlittle by little with a large stud, which he sold before he left,\r\nmuch to their disgust.\r\n\r\nIn another provincial capital there happened to be a native headman\r\nimprudently vain enough to carry a walking-stick with a chased\r\ngold-knob handle studded with brilliants. It took the fancy of the\r\nSpanish Governor, who repeatedly expressed his admiration of it, hoping\r\nthat the headman would make him a present of it. At length, when the\r\nGovernor was relieved of his post, he called together the headmen to\r\ntake formal leave of them, and at the close of a flattering speech, he\r\nsaid he would willingly hand over his official-stick as a remembrance\r\nof his command. In the hubbub of applause which followed, he added,\r\n\"and I will retain a souvenir of my loyal subordinates.\" Suiting the\r\naction to the word, he snatched the coveted stick out of the hand\r\nof the owner and kept it. A Gov.-General in my time enriched himself\r\nby peculation to such an extent that he was at his wits' end to know\r\nhow to remit his ill-gotten gains clandestinely. Finally, he resolved\r\nto send an army Captain over to Hong-Kong with P35,000 to purchase a\r\ndraft on Europe for him. The Captain went there, but he never returned.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThere were about 725 towns and 23 missions in the Colony. Each town\r\nwas locally governed by a native--in some cases a Spanish or Chinese\r\nhalf-caste--who was styled the petty-governor or _Gobernadorcillo_,\r\nwhilst his popular title was that of _Capitan_. This service was\r\ncompulsory. The elections of _Gobernadorcillos_ and their subordinates\r\ntook place every two years, the term of office counting from the July 1\r\nfollowing such elections. In the few towns where the _Gobernadorcillos_\r\nwere able to make considerable sums, the appointment was eagerly\r\nsought for, but as a rule it was considered an onerous task, and I\r\nknow several who have paid bribes to the officials to rid them of it,\r\nunder the pretext of ill-health, legal incapacity, and so on. The\r\n_Gobernadorcillo_ was supported by what was pompously termed a\r\n\"ministry,\" composed of two lieutenants of the town, lieutenants of\r\nthe wards, the chiefs of police, of plantations, and of live-stock.\r\n\r\nThe _Gobernadorcillo_ was nominally the delegate and practically the\r\nservant of his immediate chief, the Provincial Governor. He was the\r\narbiter of local petty questions, and endeavoured to adjust them,\r\nbut when they assumed a legal aspect, they were remitted to the local\r\nJustice of the Peace, who was directly subordinate to the Provincial\r\nChief Judge. He was also responsible to the Administrator for the\r\ncollection of taxes--to the Chief of the Civil Guard for the capture\r\nof criminals, and to the priest of his parish for the interests of\r\nthe Church. His responsibility for the taxes to be collected sometimes\r\nbrought him imprisonment, unless he succeeded in throwing the burden\r\non the actual collectors--the _Cabezas de Barangay_.\r\n\r\nThe _Gobernadorcillo_ was often put to considerable expense in the\r\ncourse of his two years, in entertaining and supplying the wants of\r\nofficials passing through. To cover this outlay, the loss of his own\r\ntime, the salaries of writers in the Town Hall, presents to his Spanish\r\nchiefs to secure their goodwill, and other calls upon his private\r\nincome, he naturally had to exact funds from the townspeople. Legally,\r\nhe could receive, if he chose (but few did), the munificent salary of\r\nP2 per month, and an allowance for clerks equal to about one-fifth\r\nof what he had to pay them. Some of these _Gobernadorcillos_ were\r\nwell-to-do planters, and were anxious for the office, even if it\r\ncost them money, on account of the local prestige which the title of\r\n\"Capitan\" gave them, but others were often so poor that if they had\r\nnot pilfered, this compulsory service would have ruined them. However,\r\na smart _Gobernadorcillo_ was rarely out of pocket by his service. One\r\nof the greatest hardships of his office was that he often had to\r\nabandon his plantation or other livelihood to go to the provincial\r\ncapital at his own expense whenever he was cited there. Many of them\r\nwho did not speak or understand Spanish had to pay and be at the\r\nmercy of a Secretary (_Directorcillo_), who was also a native.\r\n\r\nWhen any question arose of general interest to the townspeople (such\r\nas a serious innovation in the existing law, or the annual feasts,\r\nor the anticipated arrival of a very big official, etc.) the headmen\r\n(_principalia_) were cited to the Town Hall. They were also expected\r\nto assemble there every Sunday and Great Feast Days (three-cross Saint\r\ndays in the Calendar), to march thence in procession to the church\r\nto hear Mass, under certain penalties if they failed to attend. Each\r\none carried his stick of authority; and the official dress was a\r\nshort Eton jacket of black cloth over the shirt, the tail of which\r\nhung outside the trousers. Some _Gobernadorcillos_, imbued with a\r\nsense of the importance and solemnity of office, ordered a band to\r\nplay lively dance music at the head of the _cortege_ to and from the\r\nchurch. After Mass they repaired to the convent, and on bended knee\r\nkissed the priest's hand. Town affairs were then discussed. Some\r\npresent were chided, others were commended by their spiritual dictator.\r\n\r\nIn nearly every town the people were, and still are, divided into\r\nparties holding divergent views on town affairs, each group being ready\r\nto give the other a \"stab in the back\" when the opportunity offers,\r\nand not unfrequently these differences seriously affect the social\r\nrelations of the individual members.\r\n\r\nFor the direct collection of taxes each township was sub-divided into\r\ngroups of forty or fifty families called _Barangays_: each group had\r\nto pay taxes to its respective head, styled _Cabeza de Barangay_,\r\nwho was responsible to the petty-governor, who in turn made the\r\npayment to the Provincial Administrator for remission to the Treasury\r\n(_Intendencia_) in Manila. This _Barangay chiefdom_ system took its\r\norigin from that established by the natives themselves prior to the\r\nSpanish conquest, and in some parts of the Colony the original title\r\nof _datto_ was still applied to the chief. This position, hereditary\r\namong themselves, continued to be so for many years under Spanish\r\nrule, and was then considered an honourable distinction because it\r\ngave the heads of certain families a birthright importance in their\r\nclass. Later on they were chosen, like all the other native local\r\nauthorities, every two years, but if they had anything to lose, they\r\nwere invariably re-elected. In order to be ranked among the headmen\r\nof the town (the _principalia_), a _Barangay chief_ had to serve for\r\nten years in that capacity unless he were, meanwhile, elected to a\r\nhigher rank, such as lieutenant or _gobernadorcillo_. Everybody,\r\ntherefore, shirked the repugnant obligations of a chiefdom, for\r\nthe Government rarely recognized any bad debts in the collection of\r\nthe taxes, until the chief had been made bankrupt and his goods and\r\nchattels sold to make good the sums which he could not collect from\r\nhis group, whether it arose from their poverty, death, or from their\r\nhaving absconded. I have been present at auction sales of live-stock\r\nseized to supply taxes to the Government, which admitted no excuses\r\nor explanations. Many _Barangay chiefs_ went to prison through\r\ntheir inability or refusal to pay others' debts. On the other hand,\r\nthere were among them some profligate characters who misappropriated\r\nthe collected taxes, but the Government had really little right to\r\ncomplain, for the labour of tax-gathering was a _forced service_\r\nwithout remuneration for expenses or loss of time incurred.\r\n\r\nIn many towns, villages, and hamlets there were posts of the Civil\r\nGuard established for the arrest of criminals and the maintenance of\r\npublic order; moreover, there was in each town a body of guards called\r\n_Cuadrilleros_ for the defence of the town and the apprehension of\r\nbandits and criminals within the jurisdiction of the town only. The\r\ntown and the wards together furnished these local guards, whose\r\nsocial position was one of the humblest and least enviable. There\r\nwere frequent cases of _Cuadrilleros_ passing over to a band of\r\nbrigands. Some years ago the whole muster belonging to the town of\r\nMauban (Tayabas) suddenly took to the mountains; on the other hand,\r\nmany often rendered valuable aid to society, but their doubtful\r\nreliability vastly diminished their public utility.\r\n\r\nFrom the time Philippine administration was first organized up to\r\nthe year 1884, all the subdued natives paid tribute. Latterly it\r\nwas fixed at one peso and ten cents per annum, and those who did not\r\nchoose to work for the Government during forty days in the year, paid\r\nalso a poll-tax (_fallas_) of P3 per annum. But, as a matter of fact,\r\nthousands were declared as workers who never did work, and whilst\r\nroads were in an abominable condition and public works abandoned,\r\nnot much secret was made of the fact that a great portion of the\r\npoll-tax never reached the Treasury. These pilferings were known\r\nto the Spanish local authorities as _caidas_ or droppings; and in a\r\ncertain province I met at table a provincial chief judge, the nephew\r\nof a general, and other persons who openly discussed the value of\r\nthe different Provincial Governments (before 1884) in Luzon Island,\r\non the basis of so much for salary and so much for fees and _caidas_.\r\n\r\nHowever, although the tribute and _fallas_ system worked as well as any\r\nother would under the circumstances, for some reason, best known to the\r\nauthorities, it was abolished. In lieu thereof a scheme was proposed,\r\nobliging _every civilized inhabitant_ of the Philippines, excepting\r\nonly public servants, the clergy, and a few others, _to work for\r\nfifteen days per annum without the right of redeeming this obligation\r\nby payment_. Indeed, the decree to that effect was actually received\r\nin Manila from the Home Government, but it was so palpably ludicrous\r\nthat the Gov.-General did not give it effect. He had sufficient common\r\nsense to foresee in its application the extinction of all European\r\nprestige and moral influence over the natives if Spanish and foreign\r\ngentlemen of good family were seen sweeping the streets, lighting the\r\nlamps, road-mending, guiding buffalo-carts loaded with stones, and so\r\non. This measure, therefore, regarded by some as a practical joke,\r\nby others as the conception of a lunatic theorist--was withdrawn,\r\nor at least allowed to lapse.\r\n\r\nNevertheless, those in power were bent on reform, and the Peninsular\r\nsystem of a document of identity (_Cedula personal_), which works\r\nwell amongst Europeans, was then adopted for all civilized classes\r\nand nationalities above the age of 18 years without exception, its\r\npossession being compulsory. The amount paid for this document, which\r\nwas of nine classes, [107] from P25 value downwards, varied according\r\nto the income of the holder or the cost of his trading-licences. Any\r\nperson holding this document of a value under P3 1/2 was subject to\r\nfifteen days' forced labour per annum, or to pay 50 cents for each\r\nday he failed to work. The holder of a document of P3 1/2 or over\r\npaid also P1 1/2 \"Municipal Tax\" in lieu of labour. The \"_Cedula_\"\r\nthenceforth served as a passport for travelling within the Archipelago,\r\nto be exhibited at any time on demand by the proper authority. No\r\nlegal document was valid unless the interested parties had produced\r\ntheir _Cedulas_, the details of which were inscribed in the legal\r\ninstrument. No petitions would be noticed, and very few transactions\r\ncould be made in the Government offices without the presentation of\r\nthis identification document. The decree relating to this reform,\r\nlike most ambiguous Spanish edicts, set forth that any person was at\r\nliberty to take a higher-valued _Cedula_ than that corresponding to\r\nhis position, without the right of any official to ask the reason\r\nwhy. This clause was prejudicial to the public welfare, because it\r\nenabled thousands of able-bodied natives to evade labour for public\r\nimprovements of imperative necessity in the provinces. The public\r\nlabour question was indeed altogether a farce, and simply afforded\r\na pretext for levying a tax.\r\n\r\nIt would appear that whilst the total amount of taxation in Spanish\r\ntimes was not burdensome, the fiscal system was obviously defective.\r\n\r\nThe (American) Insular Government has continued the issue of the\r\n_Cedula_ on a reasonable plan which bears hard on no one. Forced\r\nlabour is abolished; government work is paid for out of the taxes;\r\nand the uniform cost of the _Cedula_ is one peso for every male\r\nbetween the ages of 18 and 60 years.\r\n\r\nIn 1890 certain reforms were introduced into the townships, most\r\nof which were raised to the dignity of Municipalities. The titles\r\nof _Gobernadorcillo_ and _Directorcillo_ (the words themselves in\r\nSpanish bear a sound of contempt) were changed to _Capitan Municipal_\r\nand _Secretario_ respectively (Municipal Captain and Secretary) with\r\nnominally extended powers. For instance, the Municipal Captains were\r\nempowered to disburse for public works, without appeal to Manila,\r\na few hundred pesos in the year (to be drawn, in some cases, from\r\nempty public coffers, or private purses). The functions of the local\r\nJustices of the Peace were amplified and abused to such a degree\r\nthat these officials became more the originators of strife than\r\nthe guardians of peace. The old-established obligation to supply\r\ntravellers, on payment therefor, with certain necessaries of life\r\nand means of transport was abolished.\r\n\r\nHitherto it had been the custom for a traveller on arriving at a town\r\nwithout knowing any one there, or without letters of introduction,\r\nto alight (by right) at the Tribunal, or Town Hall. Each such\r\nestablishment had, or ought to have had, a tariff of necessary\r\nprovisions and the means of travelling to the next town (such\r\nas ponies, gigs, hammocks, sedan-chairs, etc., according to the\r\nparticular conditions of the locality). Each _Barangay_ or _Cabezeria_\r\nfurnished one _Cuadrillero_ (_vide_ pp. 223, 224) for the service\r\nof the Tribunal, so that the supply of baggage-carriers, bearers,\r\netc., which one needed could not be refused on payment. The native\r\nofficial in charge of this service to travellers, and in control of the\r\n_Cuadrilleros_, was styled the _Alguacil_. Hence the Tribunal served\r\nthe double purpose of Town Hall and casual ward for wayfarers. There\r\nwere all sorts of Tribunales, from the well-built stone and wood\r\nhouse to the poverty-stricken bamboo shanty where one had to pass\r\nthe night on the floor or on the table.\r\n\r\nBy decree of Gov.-General Weyler (1888-91) dated October 17, 1888,\r\nwhich came into force on January 1, 1889, the obligation of the\r\nTribunal officials to supply provisions to travelling civilians had\r\nbeen already abolished, although, under both reforms, civilians could\r\ncontinue to take refuge at the Tribunal as theretofore. Notwithstanding\r\nthe reform of 1890, until the American advent the European traveller\r\nfound it no more difficult than before to procure _en route_ the\r\nrequisite means for provincial travelling.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIV\r\n\r\nSpanish-Philippine Finances\r\n\r\n\r\nThe secession of Mexico from the Spanish Crown in the second decade\r\nof last century brought with it a complete revolution in Philippine\r\naffairs. Direct trade with Europe through one channel or another had\r\nnecessarily to be permitted. The \"Situado,\" or subsidy (_vide_ p. 244),\r\nreceived from Mexico became a thing of the past, and necessity urged\r\nthe home authorities to relax, to a certain extent, the old restraint\r\non the development of Philippine resources.\r\n\r\nIn 1839 the first Philippine Budget was presented in the Spanish\r\nCortes, but so little interest did the affairs of the Colony excite\r\nthat it provoked no discussion. After the amendment of only one\r\nitem the Budget was adopted in silence. It was not the practice\r\nin the earliest years to publish the full Philippine Budget in the\r\nIslands, although allusion was necessarily made to items of it in the\r\n_Gaceta de Manila_. However, it could be seen without difficulty in\r\nMadrid. Considering that the Filipinos had no political rights, except\r\nfor the very brief period alluded to in Chapter xxii. (_vide Cortes de\r\nCadiz_), it is evident that popular discussion of public finance would\r\nhave been undesirable, because it could have led to no practical issue.\r\n\r\nThere is apparently no record of the Philippine Islands having been at\r\nany time in a flourishing financial condition. With few exceptions,\r\nin latter years the collected revenue of the Colony was usually much\r\nless than the estimated yield of taxes. The Budget for 1888 is here\r\ngiven in detail as an example.\r\n\r\n\r\nPHILIPPINE BUDGETS\r\n\r\n\r\n    Financial   Estimated       Income          Difference.\r\n    Year.       Income.

There were some remarkable inconsistencies\r\nin the 1888 Budget. The Inspection of Woods and Forests was an\r\ninstitution under a Chief Inspector with a salary of P6,500,\r\nassisted by a technical staff of 64 persons and 52 non-technical\r\nsubordinates. The total cost for the year was estimated at P165,960,\r\nagainst which the expected income derived from duties on felled\r\ntimber was P80,000; hence a loss of P85,960 was duly anticipated to\r\nsatisfy office-seekers. Those who wished to cut timber were subjected\r\nto very complicated and vexatious regulations. The tariff of duties\r\nand mode of calculating it were capriciously modified from time to\r\ntime on no commercial basis whatever. Merchants who had contracted to\r\nsupply timber at so much per foot for delivery within a fixed period\r\nwere never sure of their profits; for the dues might, meanwhile,\r\nbe raised without any consideration for trading interests. The most\r\nurgent material want of the Colony was easy means of communication\r\nwith the interior of the Islands. Yet, whilst this was so sadly\r\nneglected, the Budget provided the sum of P113,686.64 for a School of\r\nAgriculture in Manila and 10 model farms and Schools of Cultivation\r\nin the provinces. It was not the want of farming knowledge, but the\r\nscarcity of capital and the scandalous neglect of public highways\r\nand bridges for transport of produce which retarded agriculture. The\r\n113,000 pesos, if disbursed on roads, bridges, town halls, and\r\nlanding-jetties, would have benefited the Colony; as it was, this\r\nsum went to furnish salaries to needy Spaniards.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe following are some of the most interesting items of the Budget:\r\n\r\n\r\nCURIOUS ITEMS OF REVENUE\r\n\r\n\r\n                                                                P cts.\r\n\r\n2,760,613 Identification Documents (_Cedulas personales_),\r\ncosting 4 per cent, to collect--gross value\r\n                                                        4,401,629 25\r\nTax on the above, based on the estimated local consumption\r\nof Tobacco\r\n                                                          222,500 00\r\nChinese Capitation Tax\r\n                                                          236,250 00\r\nTax on the above for the estimated local consumption of Tobacco\r\n                                                           11,250 00\r\nRecognition of vassalage  collected  from  the unsubdued\r\nmountain tribes\r\n                                                           12,000 00\r\nIndustrial and Trading Licences (costing 1/2 per cent, to\r\ncollect), gross value\r\n                                                        1,350,000 00\r\nYield of the Opium Contract (farmed out)\r\n                                                          483,400 00\r\nYield of the Cock-fighting Contract (farmed out)\r\n                                                          149,039 00\r\nLotteries and Raffles, nett profit say\r\n                                                          501,862 00\r\nState Lands worked by miners\r\n                                                              100 00\r\nSale of State Lands\r\n                                                           50,000 00\r\nMint--Profits on the manipulation of the bullion, less expenses\r\nof the Mint (P 46,150), nett\r\n                                                          330,350 00\r\nStamps and Stamped Paper\r\n                                                          548,400 00\r\nConvict labour hired out\r\n                                                           50,000 00\r\n\r\n\r\nCURIOUS ITEMS OF EXPENDITURE\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                                                                P cts.\r\n34 per cent, of the maintenance of Fernando Po (by Decree of\r\nAugust 5, 1884)\r\n                                                           68,618 18\r\nShare of the pension paid to the heir of Christopher Columbus,\r\nthe Duke de Veragua (P 23,400 a year)\r\n                                                            3,000 00\r\nShare of the pension paid to Ferdinand Columbus, Marquis\r\nde Barboles\r\n                                                            1,000 00\r\nThe Marquis de Bedmar is the heir of the assayer and caster\r\nin the Mint of Potosi (Peru).

Sometimes they were totally overlooked by the military\r\nchiefs, and they had to seek subsistence as best they could when\r\nprovisions were not sent from the capital (_vide_p. 157).\r\n\r\nMexican soldiers arrived in nearly every ship, but there were no\r\nbarracks for them, no regular mode of living, no regulations for\r\ntheir board and lodging, etc.; hence many had to subsist by serving\r\nnatives and half-breeds, much to the discredit of the mother country,\r\nand consequent loss of prestige. Each time a new expedition was\r\norganized a fresh recruiting had to be made at great cost and with\r\ngreat delay. There was practically no regular army except those\r\nnecessarily compelled to mount guard, etc., in the city. Even the\r\nofficers received no regular pay until 1754, and there was some excuse\r\nfor stealing when they had a chance, and for the total absence of\r\nenthusiasm in the Service. When troops were urgently called for, the\r\nGov.-General had to bargain with the officers to fill the minor posts\r\nby promises of rewards, whilst the high commands were eagerly sought\r\nfor, not for the pay or the glory, but for the plunder in perspective.\r\n\r\nIn 1739 the Armoury in Manila contained only 25 Arquebuses of\r\nnative make, 120 Biscayan muskets, 40 Flint guns, 70 Hatchets, and\r\n40 Cutlasses.\r\n\r\nThe first regular military organization in these Islands was in the\r\ntime of Governor Pedro Manuel de Arandia (1754), when one regiment\r\nwas formed of five companies of native soldiers, together with four\r\ncompanies of troops which arrived with the Governor from Mexico. This\r\ncorps, afterwards known as the \"King's Regiment\" [109] (_Regimiento\r\ndel Rey_) was divided into two battalions, increased to 10 companies\r\neach as the troops returned from the provinces.\r\n\r\nThe 20 companies were each composed as follows:--\r\n\r\n1 captain, 1 lieutenant, 1 sub-lieutenant, 4 sergeants, 2 drummers,\r\n6 first corporals, 6 seconds corporals, and 88 rank and file.\r\n\r\nThe Gov.-General's Body Guard of Halberdiers was reformed, and\r\nthenceforth consisted of 18 men, under a captain and a corporal.\r\n\r\nThe Monthly Pay under these reforms was as follows:--\r\n\r\n\r\nStaff Officers.

The soldiers were not used to this\r\ndiscipline, and desertion was frequent. They much preferred the old\r\nstyle of roaming about to beg or steal and live where they chose\r\nuntil they were called out to service, and very vigorous measures\r\nhad to be adopted to compel them to comply with the new regulations.\r\n\r\nIn May, 1755, four artillery brigades were formed, the commanding\r\nofficer of each receiving P30 per month pay.\r\n\r\nIn 1757 there were 16 fortified provincial outposts, at a total\r\nestimated cost of P37,638 per annum (including Zamboanga, the chief\r\ncentre of operations against the Mahometans, which alone cost P18,831\r\nin 1757), besides the armed forces and Camp of Manila, Fort Santiago,\r\nand Cavite Arsenal and Fort, which together cost a further sum of\r\nP157,934 for maintenance in that year.\r\n\r\n\r\n    SPANISH VESSELS IN PHILIPPINE WATERS\r\n\r\n    Year 1898\r\n\r\n\r\n    Name.

In 1888 the Budget provided an\r\nallowance of 2,000 pesos for rewards for the capture or slaughter of\r\nthese ruffians. Up to the end of Spanish rule, brigandage, pillage,\r\nand murder were treated with such leniency by the judges that there\r\nwas little hope for the extinction of such crimes. When a band of\r\nthieves and assassins attacked a village or a residence, murdered its\r\ninhabitants, and carried off booty, the Civil Guard at once scoured the\r\ncountry, and often the malefactors were arrested. The Civil Guard was\r\nan excellent institution, and performed its duty admirably well; but\r\nas soon as the villains were handed over to the legal functionaries,\r\nsociety lost hope. Instead of the convicted criminals being garrotted\r\naccording to law, as the public had a right to demand, they were\r\n\"protected\"; some were let loose on the world again, whilst others\r\nwere sent to prison and allowed to escape, or they were transported to\r\na penal settlement to work without fetters, where they were just as\r\ncomfortable as if they were working for a private employer. I record\r\nthese facts from personal knowledge, for my wanderings in the Islands\r\nbrought me into contact with all sorts and conditions of men. I have\r\nbeen personally acquainted with many brigands, and I gave regular\r\nemployment to an ex-bandit for years.\r\n\r\nThe Philippine brigand--known in the northern islands as _Tulisan_\r\nand in the southern islands as _Pulajan_--is not merely an outlaw,\r\nsuch as may yet be found in Southern and Eastern Europe; his infamous\r\nwork of freebooting is never done to his satisfaction without the\r\ncomplement of bloodshed, even though his victim yield to him all\r\nwithout demur. Booty or no booty, blood must flow, if he be the\r\nordinary _Tulisan_ of the type known to the Tagalogs as _dugong-aso_\r\n(blood of a dog). as distinguished from the milder _Tulisan pulpul_\r\n(literally, the blunt brigand), who robs, uses no unnecessary violence,\r\nbut runs away if he can, and only fights when he must.\r\n\r\nAt Christmas, 1884, I went to Laguimanoc in the Province of Tayabas\r\nto spend a few days with an English friend of mine. [110] On the way\r\nthere, at Sariaya, I stayed at the house of the Captain of the Civil\r\nGuard, when a message came to say that an attack had been made the\r\nnight before on my friend's house, his manager, a Swede, having been\r\nkilled, and many others in the village wounded. The Captain showed me\r\nthe despatch, and invited me to join him as a volunteer to hunt down\r\nthe murderers. I agreed, and within half an hour we were mounted and\r\non their track all through that dark night, whilst the rain poured in\r\ntorrents. Four native soldiers were following us on foot. We jumped\r\nover ditches, through rice-paddy fields and cocoanut plantations,\r\nand then forded a river, on the opposite bank of which was the\r\nnext guards' post in charge of a lieutenant, who joined us with\r\neight foot-soldiers. That same night we together captured five of\r\nthe wretches, who had just beached a canoe containing part of their\r\nspoils. The prisoners were bound elbows together at their backs and\r\nsent forward under escort. We rode on all night until five o'clock\r\nthe next morning, arriving at the convent of Pagbilao just as Father\r\nJesus was going down to say Mass. I had almost lost my voice through\r\nbeing ten hours in the rain; but the priest was very attentive to us,\r\nand we went on in a prahu to the village where the crime had been\r\ncommitted. In another prahu the prisoners were sent in charge of\r\nthe soldiers. In the meantime, the Chief Judge and the Government\r\nDoctor of the province had gone on before us. On the way we met a\r\ncanoe going to Pagbilao, carrying the corpse of the murdered Swede\r\nfor burial. When we arrived at Laguimanoc, we found one native dead\r\nand many natives and Chinese badly wounded.\r\n\r\nMy friend's house had the front door smashed in--an iron strong-box\r\nhad been forced, and a few hundred pesos, with some rare coins, were\r\nstolen. The furniture in the dining-room was wantonly hacked about\r\nwith bowie-knives, only to satisfy a savage love for mischief. His\r\nbedroom had been entered, and there the brigands began to make\r\ntheir harvest; the bundles of wearing-apparel, jewellery, and\r\nother valuables were already tied up, when lo! the Virgin herself\r\nappeared, casting a penetrating glance of disapproval upon the wicked\r\nrevelry! Forsaking their plunder, the brigands fled in terror from the\r\nsaintly apparition. And when my friend re-entered his home and crossed\r\nthe bloodstained floor of the dining-room to go to his bedroom, the\r\ncardboard Virgin, with a trade advertisement on the back, was still\r\npeeping round the door-jamb to which she was nailed, with the words\r\n\"Please to shut the door\" printed on her spotless bust.\r\n\r\nThe next day the Captain remained in the village whilst I went on\r\nwith the Lieutenant and a few guards in a prahu down the coast,\r\nwhere we made further captures, and returned in three days. During\r\nour journey in the prahu the wind was so strong that we resolved to\r\nbeach our craft on the seashore instead of attempting to get over\r\nthe shoal of the San Juan River. We ran her ashore under full sail,\r\nand just at that moment a native rushed towards us with an iron\r\nbar in his hand. In the evening gloom he must have mistaken us for\r\na party of weather-beaten native or Chinese traders whose skulls\r\nhe might smash in at a stroke and rifle their baggage. He halted,\r\nhowever, perfectly amazed when two guards with their bayonets fixed\r\njumped forward in front of him. Then we got out, took him prisoner,\r\nand the next day he was let off with a souvenir of the lash, as\r\nthere was nothing to prove that he was a brigand by profession. The\r\nsecond leader of the brigand gang was shot through the lungs a week\r\nafterwards, by the guards who were on his track, as he was jumping\r\nfrom the window-opening of a hut, and there he died.\r\n\r\nThe Captain of the Civil Guard received an anonymous letter stating\r\nwhere the brigand chief was hiding. This fact came to the knowledge of\r\nthe native _cuadrillero_ officer who had hitherto supplied his friend,\r\nthe brigand, with rice daily, so he hastened on before the Captain\r\ncould arrive, and imposed silence for ever on the fugitive bandit by\r\nstabbing him in the back. Thus the _cuadrillero_ avoided the disclosure\r\nof unpleasant facts which would have implicated himself. The prisoners\r\nwere conducted to the provincial jail, and three years afterwards,\r\nwhen I made inquiries about them, I learnt that two of them had died\r\nof their wounds, whilst not a single one had been sentenced.\r\n\r\nThe most ignorant classes believe that certain persons are possessed\r\nof a mystic power called _anting-anting_, which preserves them from\r\nall harm, and that the body of a man so affected is even refractory\r\nto bullet or steel. Brigands are often captured wearing medallions of\r\nthe Virgin Mary or the Saints as a device of the _anting-anting_. In\r\nMaragondon (Cavite), the son of a friend of mine was enabled to go\r\ninto any remote place with impunity, because he was reputed to be\r\npossessed of this charm. Some highwaymen, too, have a curious notion\r\nthat they can escape punishment for a crime committed in Easter Week,\r\nbecause the thief on the cross was pardoned his sins.\r\n\r\nIn 1885 I purchased a small estate, where there was some good wild-boar\r\nhunting and snipe-shooting, and I had occasion to see the man who\r\nwas tenant previous to my purchase, in Manila Jail. He was accused\r\nof having been concerned in an attack upon the town of Mariquina,\r\nand was incarcerated for eighteen months without being definitely\r\nconvicted or acquitted. Three months after his release from prison\r\nhe was appointed petty-governor of his own town, much to the disgust\r\nof the people, who in vain petitioned against it in writing.\r\n\r\nI visited the Penal Settlement, known as the Agricultural Colony of\r\nSan Ramon, situated about fifteen miles north of Zamboanga, where I\r\nremained twelve days. The director of the settlement was D. Felipe\r\nDujiols, an army captain who had defended Onate (in Guipuzcoa, Spain),\r\nduring the Carlist war; so, as we were each able to relate our personal\r\nexperiences of that stirring period, we speedily became friends. As\r\nhis guest, I was able to acquire more ample information about the\r\nsystem of convict treatment. With the 25 convicts just arrived,\r\nthere were in all 150 natives of the most desperate class--assassins,\r\nthieves, conspirators, etc., working on this penal settlement. They\r\nwere well fed, fairly well lodged, and worked with almost the same\r\nfreedom as independent labourers. Within a few yards of the director's\r\nbungalow were the barracks, for the accommodation of a detachment\r\nof 40 soldiers--under the command of a lieutenant--who patrolled the\r\nsettlement during the day and mounted guard at night. During my stay\r\none prisoner was chained and flogged, but that was for a serious\r\ncrime committed the day before. The severest hardship which these\r\nconvicts had to endure under the rule of my generous host, D. Felipe,\r\nwas the obligation to work as honest men in other countries would be\r\nwilling to do. In this same penal settlement, some years ago, a party\r\nof convicts attacked and killed three of the European overseers,\r\nand then escaped to the Island of Basilan, which lies to the south\r\nof Zamboanga. The leader of these criminals was a native named Pedro\r\nCuevas, whose career is referred to at length in Chap. xxix.\r\n\r\nWithin half a day's journey from Manila there are several well-known\r\nmarauders' haunts, such as San Mateo, Imus, Silan, Indan, the mouths\r\nof the Hagonoy River (Pampanga), etc. In 1881 I was the only European\r\namongst 20 to 25 passengers in a canoe going to Balanga on the west\r\nshore of Manila Bay, when about midday a canoe, painted black and\r\nwithout the usual outriggers, bore down upon us, and suddenly two\r\ngun-shots were fired, whilst we were called upon to surrender. The\r\npirates numbered eight; they had their faces bedaubed white and their\r\ncanoe ballasted with stones. There was great commotion in our craft;\r\nthe men shouted and the women fell into a heap over me, reciting\r\nAve Marias, and calling upon all the Saints to succour them. Just\r\nas I extricated myself and looked out from under the palm-leaf\r\nawning, the pirates flung a stone which severely cut our pilot's\r\nface. They came very close, flourishing their knives, but our crew\r\nmanaged to keep them from boarding us by pushing off their canoe\r\nwith the paddles. When the enemy came within range of my revolver,\r\none of their party, who was standing up brandishing a bowie-knife,\r\nsuddenly collapsed into a heap. This seemed to discourage the rest,\r\nwho gave up the pursuit, and we went on to Balanga.\r\n\r\nThe most famous _Tulisan_ within living memory was a Chinese half-caste\r\nnamed Juan Fernandez, commonly known as _Tancad_ (\"tall,\" in Tagalog)\r\nbecause of his extraordinary stature. His sphere of operations was\r\naround Bulacan, Tarlac, Morong, and Nueva Ecija. He took part in\r\n21 crimes which could have been proved against him, and doubtless\r\nmany more. A man of wonderful perception and great bravery, he was\r\nonly 35 years old when he was captured in Bulacan Province by the\r\nSpanish Captain Villa Abrille. Brought before a court-martial on the\r\nspecific charge of being the chief actor in a wholesale slaughter at\r\nTayud, which caused a great sensation at the time, he and ten of his\r\ncompanions were executed on August 28, 1877, to the immense relief of\r\nthe people, to whom the very name of _Tancad_ gave a thrill of horror.\r\n\r\nNo one experienced in the Colony ever thought of privately prosecuting\r\na captured brigand, for a criminal or civil lawsuit in the Philippines\r\nwas one of the worst calamities that could befall a man. Between\r\nnotaries, procurators, barristers, and the sluggish process of the\r\ncourts, a litigant was fleeced of his money, often worried into a\r\nbad state of health, and kept in horrible suspense for years. It was\r\nas hard to get the judgement executed as it was to win the case. Even\r\nwhen the question at issue was supposed to be settled, a defect in the\r\nsentence could always be concocted to re-open the whole affair. If the\r\ncase had been tried and judgement given under the Civil Code, a way\r\nwas often found to convert it into a criminal case; and when apparently\r\nsettled under the Criminal Code, a flaw could be discovered under the\r\n_Laws of the Indies_, or the _Siete Partidas_, or the _Roman Law_,\r\nor the _Novisima Recopilacion_, or the _Antiguos fueros_, Decrees,\r\nRoyal Orders, _Ordenanzas de buen Gobierno_, and so forth, by which\r\nthe case could be re-opened. It was the same in the 16th century\r\n(_vide_ p. 56).\r\n\r\nI knew a planter in Negros Island who was charged with homicide. The\r\njudge of his province acquitted him, but fearing that he might\r\nagain be arrested on the same charge, he came up to Manila with me\r\nto procure a ratification of the sentence in the Supreme Court. The\r\nlegal expenses were so enormous that he was compelled to fully mortgage\r\nhis plantation. Weeks passed, and having spent all his money without\r\ngetting justice, I lent his notary L40 to assist in bringing the case\r\nto an end. The planter returned to Negros apparently satisfied that he\r\nwould be troubled no further, but later on, the newly-appointed judge\r\nin that Island, whilst prospecting for fees by turning up old cases,\r\nunfortunately came across this one, and my planter acquaintance was\r\nsentenced to eight years' imprisonment, although the family lawyer,\r\nproceeding on the same shifty lines, still hoped to find defects in\r\nthe sentence in order to reverse it in favour of his client.\r\n\r\nAvailing one's self of the dilatoriness of the Spanish law, it was\r\npossible for a man to occupy a house, pay no rent, and refuse to quit\r\non legal grounds during a couple of years or more. A person who had\r\nnot a cent to lose could persecute another of means by a trumped-up\r\naccusation until he was ruined, by an \"_informacion de pobreza_\"--a\r\ndeclaration of poverty--which enabled the persecutor to keep the\r\ncase going as long as he chose without needing money for fees. [111]\r\nA case of this kind was often started at the instigation of a native\r\nlawyer. When it had gone on for a certain time, the prosecutor's\r\nadviser would propose an \"extra-judicial arrangement,\" to extort\r\ncosts from the wearied and browbeaten defendant.\r\n\r\nAbout the year 1886 there was a _cause celebre_, the parties being\r\nthe firm of Jurado & Co. _versus_ the Hong-Kong and Shanghai Banking\r\nCorporation. The Bank had agreed to make advances on goods to be\r\nimported by the firm in exchange for the firm's acceptances. The\r\nagreement was subject to six months' notice from the Bank. In\r\ndue course the Bank had reason to doubt the genuineness of certain\r\ndocuments. Mr. Jurado was imprisoned, but shortly released on bail. He\r\nwas dismissed from his official post of second chief of Telegraphs,\r\nworth P4,000 a year. Goods, as they arrived for his firm, were\r\nstored pending litigation, and deteriorated to only a fraction of\r\ntheir original value. His firm was forced by these circumstances into\r\nliquidation, and Mr. Jurado sued the Bank for damages. The case was\r\nopen for several years, during which time the Bank coffers were once\r\nsealed by judicial warrant, a sum of cash was actually transported from\r\nthe Bank premises, and the manager was nominally arrested, but really\r\na prisoner on parole in his house. Several sentences of the Court were\r\ngiven in favour of each party. Years after this they were all quashed\r\non appeal to Madrid. Mr. Jurado went to Spain to fight his case,\r\nand in 1891 I accidentally met him and his brother (a lawyer) in the\r\nstreet in Madrid. The brother told me the claim against the Bank then\r\namounted to P935,000, and judgement for that sum would be given within\r\na fortnight. Still, years after that, when I was again in Manila, the\r\ncase was yet pending, and another onslaught was made on the Bank. The\r\nCourt called on the manager to deliver up the funds of the Bank, and\r\non his refusal to do so a mechanic was sent there to open the safes,\r\nbut he laboured in vain for a week. Then a syndicate of Philippine\r\ncapitalists was formed to fleece the Bank, one of its most energetic\r\nmembers being a native private banker in Manila. Whilst the case was\r\nin its first stages I happened to be discussing it at a shop in the\r\n_Escolta_ when one of the partners, a Spaniard, asked me if I would\r\nlike to see with my own eyes the contending lawyers putting their\r\nheads together over the matter. \"If so,\" said he, \"you have only to\r\ngo through my shop and up the winding back staircase, from the landing\r\nof which you can see them any day you like at one o'clock.\" I accepted\r\nhis invitation, and there, indeed, were the rival advocates laughing,\r\ngesticulating, and presumably cogitating how they could plunder the\r\nlitigant who had most money to spend. At one stage of the proceedings\r\nthe Bank specially retained a Spanish lawyer of great local repute,\r\nwho went to Madrid to push the case. Later on Mr. Francis, Q.C.,\r\nwas sent over to Manila from Hong-Kong to advise the Bank. The Prime\r\nMinister was appealed to and the good offices of our Ambassador in\r\nMadrid were solicited. For a long time the Bank was placed in a most\r\nawkward legal dilemma. The other side contended that the Bank could\r\nnot be heard, or appear for itself or by proxy, on the ground that\r\nunder its own charter it had no right to be established in Manila;\r\nthat, in view of the terms of that charter, it had never been legally\r\nregistered as a Bank in Manila, and that it had no legal existence\r\nin the Philippines. This was merely a technical quibble. Several\r\ntimes when the case was supposed to be finally settled, it was again\r\nre-opened. Happily it may now be regarded as closed for ever.\r\n\r\nA great many well-to-do natives have a mania for seeing their sons\r\nlaunched into the \"learned professions\"; hence there was a mob of\r\nnative doctors who made a scanty living, and a swarm of half-lawyers,\r\npopularly called \"abogadillos,\" who were a pest to the Colony. Up\r\nto the beginning of the 18th century the offices of solicitors and\r\nnotaries were filled from Mexico, where the licences to practise\r\nin Manila were publicly sold. After that period the colleges and\r\nthe university issued licences to natives, thus creating a class of\r\nnative pettifogging advocates who stirred up strife to make cases,\r\nfor this purpose availing themselves of the intricacies of the law.\r\n\r\nThe Spanish-Philippine _Criminal Law Procedure_ was briefly as\r\nfollows:--(1) The Judge of Instruction took the _sumaria_, i.e.,\r\nthe inquiry into whether a crime had been committed, and, if so,\r\nwho was the presumptive culprit. It was his duty to find the facts\r\nand sift the case. In a light case he could order the immediate\r\narrest of the presumptive delinquent; in a grave case he would\r\nremit it. (2) In the Court of First Instance the verbal evidence was\r\nheard and sifted, the _fiscal_, or prosecuting attorney, expressing\r\nhis opinion to the judge. The judge would then qualify the crime,\r\nand decide who was the presumptive culprit. Then the defence began,\r\nand when this was exhausted the judge would give his opinion. This\r\ncourt could not acquit or condemn the accused. The opinion on the\r\n_sumaria_ was merely advisory, and not a sentence. This inquiry was\r\ncalled the \"vista\"; it was not in reality a trial, as the defendant\r\nwas not allowed to cross-examine; but, on the other hand, in theory,\r\nhe was not called upon to prove his innocence before two courts, but\r\nbefore the sentencing court (_Audiencia_) only. The case would then\r\nbe remitted with the _sumaria_, and the opinion of the Court of First\r\nInstance, to the _Audiencia_, or Supreme Court, for review of errors\r\nof law, but not of facts which remained. The _Audiencia_ did not call\r\nfor testimony, but, if new facts were produced, it would remit back\r\nthe _sumaria_ to the lower court, with the new written testimony\r\nadded to the _autos_ (documents in the case). These new witnesses\r\nwere never confronted with the accused, and might never be seen by\r\nhim, and were not cross-examined. If no new facts were elicited,\r\nthe record of the lower court would be accepted by the _Audiencia_,\r\nerrors of law being the only point at issue, and this court might\r\nat once pass sentence. In practice the _Audiencia_ usually treated\r\nthe finding of the lower court as sentence (not merely opinion),\r\nand confirmed it, if no new testimony were produced and there were no\r\nerrors of law. But, although the opinion of the lower court might be\r\npractically an acquittal, the _Audiencia_ might find errors of law,\r\nthus placing the accused twice in jeopardy. If the case were remitted\r\nback, in view of new testimony, it finally returned to the _Audiencia_\r\nfor decision, nine judges being required to give their opinion in a\r\ngrave case, so that if the Court of First Instance and five judges\r\nof the _Audiencia_ found the accused guilty, there was a majority\r\nagainst him. The sentencing court was always the _Audiencia_. If\r\nthe sentence were against the accused, a final appeal could be made,\r\nby \"writ of error,\" to the Supreme Court of Spain, whose decision,\r\nhowever, rested not on facts, but on errors of law.\r\n\r\nThe (American) Insular Government tacitly admitted that the Spanish\r\nwritten law was excellent, notwithstanding its fulfilment being\r\ndilatory. The Spanish Penal Code has been adopted in its general\r\napplication, but a new code, based on it, was in course of compilation\r\nin 1904. The application of the Spanish Code occasionally evolves\r\nsome curious issues, showing its variance with fundamental American\r\nlaw. For instance, in September, 1905, a native adulteress having\r\nbeen found by her husband _in flagrante delicto_, he stabbed her\r\nto death. The Spanish law sustains the husband's right to slay his\r\nfaithless consort and her paramour, in such circumstances (_vide_\r\np. 80), but provides that the lawful slayer shall be banished\r\nfrom the country. The principle of this law is based on Roman law,\r\nhuman instinctive reasoning, and the spirit of the law among the\r\nLatin nations of Europe. American law assumes this natural act of\r\nthe husband to be a crime, but whilst admitting the validity of the\r\nSpanish Code in these Islands, the American bench was puzzled to\r\ndecide what punishment could be inflicted if the arraigned husband\r\ncommitted contempt of court by thereafter returning to his native land.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XV\r\n\r\nTrade of the Islands\r\nIts Early History\r\n\r\n\r\nFrom within a year after the foundation of the Colony up to the\r\nsecond decade of last century direct communication with Mexico was\r\nmaintained by the State galleons, termed the _Naos de Acapulco_. The\r\nfirst sailings of the galleons were to Navidad, but for over two\r\ncenturies Acapulco was the port of destination on the Mexican side, and\r\nthis inter-communication with New Spain only ceased a few years before\r\nthat Colony threw off its allegiance to the mother country. But it was\r\nnot alone the troubled state of political affairs which brought about\r\nthe discontinuance of the galleons' voyages, although the subsequent\r\nsecession of Mexico would have produced this effect. The expense of\r\nthis means of intercourse was found to be bearing too heavily upon\r\nthe scanty resources of the Exchequer, for the condition of Spain's\r\nfinances had never, at any period, been so lamentable.\r\n\r\nThe Commander of the State _Nao_ had the title of General, with a\r\nsalary of P40,000 per annum. The chief officer received P25,000 a\r\nyear. The quarter-master was remunerated with 9 per cent, on the value\r\nof the merchandise shipped, and this amounted to a very considerable\r\nsum per voyage.\r\n\r\nThe last State galleon left Manila for Mexico in 1811, and the last\r\nsailing from Acapulco for Manila was in 1815.\r\n\r\nThese ships are described as having been short fore and aft, but\r\nof great beam, light draught, and, when afloat, had a half-moon\r\nappearance, being considerably elevated at bows and stern. They were\r\nof 1,500 tons burden, had four decks, and carried guns.\r\n\r\nThe Gov.-General, the clergy, the civil functionaries, troops,\r\nprisoners, and occasionally private persons, took passage in these\r\nships to and from the Philippines. It was practically the Spanish Mail.\r\n\r\nThe Colony had no coin of its own. [112] It was simply a dependency\r\nof Mexico; and all that it brought in tribute and taxes to its Royal\r\nTreasury belonged to the Crown, and was at the King's disposal. For\r\nmany years these payments were made wholly--and afterwards\r\npartially--in kind, and were kept in the Royal Stores. As the junks\r\nfrom China arrived each spring, this colonial produce belonging to the\r\nCrown was bartered for Chinese wares and manufactures. These goods,\r\npacked in precisely 1,500 bales, each of exactly the same size,\r\nconstituted the official cargo, and were remitted to Mexico by the\r\nannual galleon. The surplus space in the ship was at the disposal of\r\na few chosen merchants who formed the \"_Consulado_,\"--a trading ring\r\nwhich required each member to have resided in the Colony a stipulated\r\nnumber of years, and to be possessed of at least eight thousand pesos.\r\n\r\nFor the support of the Philippine administration Mexico remitted\r\nback to Manila, on the return of the galleon, a certain percentage of\r\nthe realized value of the above-mentioned official cargo, but seeing\r\nthat in any case--whether the Philippine Treasury were flourishing\r\nor not--a certain sum was absolutely necessary for the maintenance\r\nof the Colony, this remittance, known as the \"_Real Situado_,\" or\r\nroyal subsidy, was, from time to time, fixed. [113]\r\n\r\nThe Philippine Colony was therefore nominally self-supporting, and\r\nthe _Situado_ was only a guaranteed income, to be covered, as far as\r\nit could be, by shipments of foreign bartered manufactures and local\r\nproduce to Mexico. But, as a matter of fact, the Mexican subsidy\r\nseldom, if ever, was so covered.\r\n\r\nBy Royal Decree of June 6, 1665, the Mexican subsidy to the Philippines\r\nwas fixed at P2,500,000, of which P2,000,000 was remitted in coin\r\nand P500,000 in merchandise for the Royal Stores. Against this was\r\nremitted value in goods (Philippine taxes and tribute) P 176,101.40\r\nso that the net Subsidy, or donation, from Mexico was P 2,323,898.60.\r\n\r\nHence, in the course of time, coin--Mexican dollars called\r\n_pesos_--found its way in large quantities to the Philippines, and\r\nthence to China.\r\n\r\nThe yearly value of the merchants' shipments was first limited to\r\nP250,000, whilst the return trade could not exceed P500,000 in coin\r\nor stores, and this was on the supposition that 100 per cent. profit\r\nwould be realized on the sales in Mexico.\r\n\r\nThe allotment of surplus freight-room in the galleon was regulated by\r\nthe issue of _boletas_--documents which, during a long period, served\r\nas paper money in fact, for the holders were entitled to use them for\r\nshipping goods, or they could transfer them to others who wished to\r\ndo so. The demand for freight was far greater than the carrying power\r\nprovided. Shipping warrants were delivered gratis to the members\r\nof the _Consulado_, to certain ecclesiastics, and others. Indeed,\r\nit is asserted by some writers that the Governor's favourites were\r\nserved with preference, to the prejudice of legitimate trade.\r\n\r\nThe Spaniards were not allowed to go to China to fetch merchandise\r\nfor transhipment, but they could freely buy what was brought by the\r\nChinese. Indian and Persian goods uninterruptedly found their way to\r\nManila. Spanish goods came exclusively _via_ Mexico.\r\n\r\nThe mail galleon usually sailed in the month of July in each year, and\r\nthe voyage occupied about five months. Very strict regulations were\r\nlaid down regarding the course to be steered, but many calamities\r\nbefell the ships, which were not unfrequently lost through the\r\nincapacity of the officers who had procured their appointments\r\nby favour. For a century and a half there was practically no\r\ncompetition. All was arranged beforehand as to shape, quantity, size,\r\netc., of each bale. There was, however, a deal of trickery practised\r\nrespecting the declared values, and the _boletas_ were often quoted\r\nat high prices. Even the selling-price of the goods sent to Mexico\r\nwas a preconcerted matter.\r\n\r\nThe day of the departure of the galleon or its arrival with a couple\r\nof millions of pesos or more, [114] and new faces, was naturally one\r\nof rejoicing--it was almost the event of the year. A _Te Deum_ was\r\nchanted in the churches, the bells tolled, and musicians perambulated\r\nthe streets, which were illuminated and draped with bunting.\r\n\r\nSo far as commercial affairs were concerned, the Philippine merchants\r\npassed very easy lives in those palmy days. One, sometimes two, days\r\nin the week were set down in the calendar as Saint-days to be strictly\r\nobserved; hence an active business life would have been incompatible\r\nwith the exactions of religion. The only misadventure they had to fear\r\nwas the loss of the galleon. Market fluctuations were unknown. During\r\nthe absence of the galleon, there was nothing for the merchants to do\r\nbut to await the arrival of the Chinese junks in the months of March,\r\nApril, and May, and prepare their bales. For a century and a half this\r\nsort of trading was lucrative; it required no smartness, no spirit of\r\nenterprise or special tact. Shippers were busy for only three months\r\nin the year, and during the remaining nine months they could enjoy\r\nlife as they thought fit--cut off from the rest of the world.\r\n\r\nSome there were who, without means of their own, speculated with the\r\n_Obras Pias_funds, lent at interest. [115]\r\n\r\nThe Philippine merchants often lost the value of their shipments in the\r\nState galleons by shipwreck or seizure by enemies. Mexico frequently\r\nlost the Philippine remittances to her, and the specie she sent to\r\nthe Philippines. The State galleon made only one voyage a year there\r\nand back, if all went well; but if it were lost, the shipment had to\r\nbe renewed, and it often happened that several galleons were seized\r\nin a year by Spain's enemies.\r\n\r\nThe abortive attempt to annex the British Isles to the Spanish Crown in\r\n1588 brought about the collapse of Spain's naval supremacy, enabling\r\nEnglish mariners to play havoc with her galleons from America. The\r\nPhilippine Islands, as a colony, had at that date only just come into\r\nexistence, but during the series of Anglo-Spanish wars which preceded\r\nthe \"Family Compact\" (_vide_ p. 87), Philippine-Mexican galleons\r\nladen with treasure became the prey of British commanders, notably\r\nAdmiral Anson. The coasts were beset by Anson's squadron. He was the\r\nterror of the Philippines from the year 1743. His exploits gave rise\r\nto consternation, and numerous councils were held to decide what to\r\ndo to get rid of him. The captured galleon _Pilar_ gave one-and-a-half\r\nmillion pesos to the enemy--the _Covadonga_ was an immense prize. All\r\nover the Islands the Spaniards were on the alert for the dreaded foe;\r\nevery provincial Governor sent look-outs to high promontories with\r\norders to signal by beacons if the daring Britisher's ships were seen\r\nhovering about, whilst, in Manila, the citizens were forewarned that,\r\nat any moment, they might be called upon to repel the enemy.\r\n\r\nNot only in fleets of gold-laden vessels did Spain and her dependencies\r\nlose immense wealth through her hostile ambition, for in view of the\r\nrestrictions on Philippine trade, and the enormous profits accruing\r\nto the Spanish merchants on their shipments, British, Dutch, French,\r\nand Danish traders competed with them. Shippers of these nationalities\r\nbought goods in Canton, where they established their own factories,\r\nor collecting-stores. In 1731 over three millions of Mexican dollars\r\n(pesos) were taken there for making purchases, and these foreign ships\r\nlanded the stuffs, etc., in contraband at the American ports, where\r\nSpaniards themselves co-operated in the trade which their absolute King\r\ndeclared illicit, whilst the traders considered it a natural right.\r\n\r\nAs the Southern (Peninsula) Spanish merchants were helpless to stay\r\nthis competition, which greatly affected their profits, their rancorous\r\ngreed made them clamour against the Philippine trade, to which they\r\nchose to attribute their misfortunes, and the King was petitioned to\r\ncurtail the commerce of this Colony with Mexico for their exclusive\r\nbenefit. But it was not Spanish home trade alone which suffered:\r\nAcapulco was so beset by smugglers, whose merchandise, surreptitiously\r\nintroduced, found its way to Mexico City, that, in latter days, the\r\nPhilippine galleons' cargoes did not always find a market. Moreover,\r\nall kinds of frauds were practised about this time in the quality of\r\nthe goods baled for shipment, and the bad results revealed themselves\r\non the Mexican side. The shippers, unwisely, thought it possible to\r\ndeceive the Mexicans by sending them inferior articles at old prices;\r\nhence their disasters became partly due to \"the vaulting ambition that\r\no'erleaps itself and falls on t'other side.\" The Governor commissioned\r\nfour of the most respectable Manila traders to inspect the sorting\r\nand classification of the goods shipped. These citizens distinguished\r\nthemselves so highly, to their own advantage, that the Governor had\r\nto suppress the commission and abandon the control, in despair of\r\nfinding honest colleagues. Besides this fraud, contraband goods were\r\ntaken to Acapulco in the galleons themselves, hidden in water-jars.\r\n\r\nIn the time of Governor Pedro de Arandia (1754-59) the 100 per\r\ncent. fixed profit was no longer possible. Merchants came down to\r\nAcapulco and forced the market, by waiting until the ships were obliged\r\nto catch the monsoon back, or lie up for another season, so that often\r\nthe goods had to be sold for cost, or a little over. In 1754 returns\r\nwere so reduced that the _Consulado_ was owing to the _Obras Pias_\r\nover P300,000, and to the _Casa Misericordia_ P147,000, without any\r\nhope of repayment. The _Casa Misericordia_ lent money at 40 per cent.,\r\nthen at 35 per cent., and in 1755 at 20 per cent. interest, but the\r\nstate of trade made capital hardly acceptable even at this last rate.\r\n\r\nEarly in the 18th century the Cadiz merchants, jealous of the\r\nPhilippine shippers, protested that the home trade was much injured by\r\nthe cargoes carried to Mexico in Philippine bottoms. So effectually\r\ndid they influence the King in their favour that he issued a decree\r\nprohibiting the trade between China and the Philippines in all\r\nwoven stuffs, skein and woven silk and clothing, except the finest\r\nlinen. Manila imports from China were thereby limited to fine linen,\r\nporcelain, wax, pepper, cinnamon, and cloves. At the expiration of six\r\nmonths after the proclamation of the decree, any remaining stocks of\r\nthe proscribed articles were to be burnt! Thenceforth trade in such\r\nprohibited articles was to be considered illicit, and such goods\r\narriving in Mexico after that date were to be confiscated.\r\n\r\nBy Royal Decree dated October 27, 1720, and published in Mexico by the\r\nViceroy on February 15, 1724, the following was enacted, viz.:--That\r\nin future there should be two galleons per annum, instead of one\r\nas heretofore, carrying merchandise to Acapulco, each to be of 500\r\ntons. That the merchandise sent in the two was to be of the value of\r\nP300,000 precisely in gold, cinnamon, wax, porcelain, cloves, pepper,\r\netc., but not silks, or stuffs of any kind containing silk, under\r\npain of confiscation, to be allotted in three equal parts, namely,\r\nto the Fiscal officer, the Judge intervening, and the informer, and\r\nperpetual banishment from the Indies of all persons concerned in the\r\nshipment. That the number of Manila merchants was to be fixed, and any\r\none not included in that number was to be prohibited from trading. No\r\necclesiastic, or professor of religion, or foreigner could be included\r\nin the elected few, whose rights to ship were non-transferable. That if\r\nthe proceeds of the sale happened to exceed the fixed sum of P600,000,\r\non account of market prices being higher than was anticipated,\r\nonly that amount could be brought back in money, and the difference,\r\nor excess, in goods. [If it turned out to be less than that amount,\r\nthe difference could not be remitted in cash by Mexican merchants for\r\nfurther purchases, the spirit of the decree being to curtail the supply\r\nof goods from this Colony to Mexico, for the benefit of the Spanish\r\nhome traders. The infringer of this regulation was subject to the\r\npenalties of confiscation and two years' banishment from the Indies.]\r\n\r\nBy Royal Decree of the year 1726, received and published in Manila\r\non August 9, 1727, the following regulations were made known,\r\nviz.:--That the prohibition relating to silk and all-silk goods was\r\nrevoked. That only one galleon was to be sent each year (instead of\r\ntwo) as formerly. That the prohibition on clothing containing some\r\nsilk, and a few other articles, was maintained. That for five years\r\ncertain stuffs of fine linen were permitted to be shipped, to the\r\nlimit of 4,000 pieces per annum, precisely in boxes containing each\r\n500 pieces.\r\n\r\nThe Southern Spanish traders in 1729 petitioned the King against the\r\nPhilippine trade in woven goods, and protested against the five-years'\r\npermission granted in the above decree of 1726, declaring that it\r\nwould bring about the total ruin of the Spanish weaving industry,\r\nand that the galleons, on their return to the Philippines, instead of\r\nloading Spanish manufactures, took back specie for the continuance\r\nof their traffic to the extent of three or four millions of pesos\r\neach year. The King, however, refused to modify the decree of 1726\r\nuntil the five years had expired, after which time the Governor was\r\nordered to load the galleons according to the former decree of 1720.\r\n\r\nThe Manila merchants were in great excitement. The Governor, under\r\npretext that the original Royal Decree ought to have been transmitted\r\ndirect to the Philippines and not merely communicated by the Mexican\r\nViceroy, agreed to \"obey and not fulfil\" its conditions.\r\n\r\nFrom the year 1720, during the period of prohibitions, the Royal\r\nTreasury lost about P50,000 per annum, and many of the taxes were\r\nnot recovered in full. Besides this, the donations to Government by\r\nthe citizens, which sometimes had amounted to P40,000 in one year,\r\nceased. A double loss was also caused to Mexico, for the people there\r\nhad to pay much higher prices for their stuffs supplied by Spanish\r\n(home) monopolists, whilst Mexican coffers were being drained to make\r\ngood the deficits in the Philippine Treasury. The Manila merchants\r\nwere terribly alarmed, and meeting after meeting was held. A Congress\r\nof Government officials and priests was convened, and each priest\r\nwas asked to express his opinion on the state of trade.\r\n\r\nCommercial depression in the Philippines had never been so marked,\r\nand the position of affairs was made known to the King in a petition,\r\nwhich elicited the Royal Decree dated April 8, 1734. It provided\r\nthat the value of exports should thenceforth not exceed P500,000,\r\nand the amount permitted to return was also raised to P1,000,000\r\n(always on the supposition that 100 per cent. over cost laid down\r\nwould be realized). The dues and taxes paid in Acapulco on arrival,\r\nand the dues paid in Manila on starting, amounted to 17 per cent. of\r\nthe million expected to return. [116] This covered the whole cost\r\nof maintenance of ships, salaries, freight, and charges of all kinds\r\nwhich were paid by Government in the first instance, and then recovered\r\nfrom the _Consulado_.\r\n\r\nThe fixed number of merchants was to be decided by the merchants\r\nthemselves without Government intervention. Licence was granted\r\nto allow those of Cavite to be of the number, and both Spaniards\r\nand natives were eligible. Military and other professional men,\r\nexcept ecclesiastics, could thenceforth be of the number. Foreigners\r\nwere strictly excluded. The right to ship (_boleta_) was not to be\r\ntransferable, except to _poor widows_. A sworn invoice of the shipment\r\nwas to be sent to the royal officials and magistrate of the Supreme\r\nCourt of Mexico for the value to be verified. The official in charge,\r\nor supercargo, was ordered to make a book containing a list of the\r\ngoods and their respective owners, and to hand this to the commander of\r\nthe fortress in Acapulco, with a copy of the same for the Viceroy. The\r\nViceroy was to send his copy to the Audit Office to be again copied,\r\nand the last copy was to be forwarded to the Royal Indian Council.\r\n\r\nEvery soldier, sailor, and officer was at liberty to disembark with a\r\nbox containing goods of which the Philippine value should not exceed\r\nP30, in addition to his private effects. All hidden goods were to be\r\nconfiscated, one-half to the Royal Treasury, one-fourth to the Judge\r\nintervening, and one-fourth to the informer; but, if such confiscated\r\ngoods amounted to P50,000 in value, the Viceroy and Mexican Council\r\nwere to determine the sum to be awarded to the Judge and the informer.\r\n\r\nIf the shipment met a good market and realized more than 1,000,000\r\npesos, only 1,000,000 could be remitted in money, and the excess\r\nin duty-paid Mexican merchandise. If the shipment failed to fetch\r\n1,000,000, the difference could not be sent in money for making new\r\npurchases. (The same restriction as in the decree of 1720.)\r\n\r\nThe object of these measures was to prevent Mexicans supplying\r\ntrading capital to the Philippines instead of purchasing Peninsula\r\nmanufactures. It was especially enacted that all goods sent to Mexico\r\nfrom the Philippines should have been purchased with the capital\r\nof the Philippine shippers, and be their exclusive property without\r\nlien. If it were discovered that on the return journey of the galleon\r\nmerchandise was carried to the Philippines belonging to the Mexicans,\r\nit was to be confiscated, and a fine imposed on the interested parties\r\nof three times the value, payable to the Royal Treasury, on the first\r\nconviction. The second conviction entailed confiscation of all the\r\nculprits' goods and banishment from Mexico for 10 years.\r\n\r\nThe weights and measures of the goods shipped were to be Philippine,\r\nand, above all, wax was to be sent in pieces of precisely the same\r\nweight and size as by custom established.\r\n\r\nThe Council for freight allotment in Manila was to comprise the\r\nGovernor, the senior Magistrate, and, failing this latter, the\r\nMinister of the Supreme Court next below him; also the Archbishop, or\r\nin his stead the Dean of the Cathedral; an ordinary Judge, a Municipal\r\nCouncillor, and _one merchant_ as Commissioner in representation of\r\nthe eight who formed the _Consulado_ of merchants.\r\n\r\nThe expulsion of the non-christian Chinese in 1755 (_vide_\r\np. 111) caused a deficit in the taxes of P30,000 per annum. The\r\nonly exports of Philippine produce at this date were cacao, sugar,\r\nwax, and sapanwood. Trade, and consequently the Treasury, were in a\r\ndeplorable state. To remedy matters, and to make up the above P30,000,\r\nthe Government proposed to levy an export duty which was to be applied\r\nto the cost of armaments fitted out against pirates. Before the tax\r\nwas approved of by the King some friars loaded a vessel with export\r\nmerchandise, and absolutely refused to pay the impost, alleging\r\nimmunity. The Governor argued that there could be no religious\r\nimmunity in trade concerns. The friars appealed to Spain, and the\r\ntax was disapproved of; meantime, most of the goods and the vessel\r\nitself rotted pending the solution of the question by the Royal\r\nIndian Council.\r\n\r\nThere have been three or four periods during which no galleon arrived\r\nat the Philippines for two or three consecutive years, and coin became\r\nvery scarce, giving rise to rebellion on the part of the Chinese\r\nand misery to the Filipinos. After the capture of the _Covadonga_ by\r\nthe British, six years elapsed before a galleon brought the subsidy;\r\nthen the _Rosario_ arrived with 5,000 gold ounces (nominally P80,000).\r\n\r\nHowever, besides the subsidy, the Colony had certain other sources\r\nof public revenue, as will be seen by the following:--\r\n\r\n\r\n    PHILIPPINE BUDGET FOR THE YEAR 1757\r\n\r\n    Income.\r\n                                                         P cts.\r\n    Stamped Paper                                   12,199 87 1/2\r\n    Port and Anchorage Dues                         25,938 00\r\n    Sale of Offices, such as Notaries, Public\r\n    Scribes, Secretaryships, etc.                    5,839 12 1/2\r\n    Offices hired out                                4,718 75\r\n    Taxes farmed out                                28,500 00\r\n    Excise duties                                    4,195 00\r\n    Sale of _Encomiendas_, and 22 provincial\r\n    govts. hired out                               263,588 00\r\n    Divers taxes, fines, pardons, etc.              18,156 00\r\n    Tribute, direct tax                              4,477 00\r\n    Sudsidy from Mexico                            250,000 00\r\n    Deficit                                         79,844 00\r\n                                                   ------- --\r\n                                                 P 697,455 75\r\n\r\n    Expenditure.\r\n                                                         P cts.\r\n    Supreme Court                                   34,219 75\r\n    Treasury and Audit Office                       12,092 00\r\n    University                                         800 00\r\n    Cost of the annual Galleon                      23,465 00\r\n    Clergy                                         103,751 00\r\n    Land and sea forces all over the Philippines\r\n    including offensive and defensive operations\r\n    against Moros--Staff and Material              312,864 00\r\n    Salaries, Hospital and Divers Expenses          70,158 00\r\n    Remittance in Merchandise to Mexico on account\r\n    of the Subsidy                                 140,106 00\r\n                                                   ------- --\r\n                                                 P 697,455 75\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen the merchant citizens of Manila were in clover, they made\r\ndonations to the Government to cover the deficits, and loans were\r\nraised amongst them to defray extraordinary disbursements, such as\r\nexpeditions against the Mahometans, etc. In the good years, too, the\r\nvaluation of the merchandise shipped and the corresponding returns were\r\nunderrated in the sworn declarations, so that an immensely profitable\r\ntrade was done on a larger scale than was legally permitted. Between\r\n1754 and 1759, in view of the reduced profits, due to the circumstances\r\nalready mentioned, the Manila merchants prayed the King for a reduction\r\nof the royal dues, which had been originally fixed on the basis of\r\nthe gross returns being equal to double the cost of the merchandise\r\nlaid down in Acapulco. To meet the case, another Royal Decree was\r\nissued confirming the fixed rate of royal dues and disbursements, but\r\nin compensation the cargo was thenceforth permitted to include 4,000\r\npieces of fine linen, without restriction as to measure or value; the\r\nsworn value was abolished, and the maximum return value of the whole\r\nshipment was raised to one-and-a-half millions of pesos. Hence the\r\ntotal dues and disbursements became equal to 11 1/3 per cent. instead\r\nof 17 per cent., as heretofore, on the anticipated return value.\r\n\r\nIn 1763 the Subsidy, together with the _Consulado_ shippers' returns,\r\namounted in one voyage to two-and-a-half millions of pesos (_vide_\r\np. 88). After the independence of Mexico (1819), tribute in kind\r\n(tobacco) was, until recently, shipped direct to Spain, and Peninsula\r\ncoin began to circulate in these Islands (_vide_ Currency).\r\n\r\nConsequent on the banishment of the non-christian Chinese in 1755,\r\ntrade became stagnant. The Philippines now experienced what Spain had\r\nfelt since the reign of Phillip III., when the expulsion of 900,000\r\nMoorish agriculturists and artisans crippled her home industries,\r\nwhich needed a century and a half to revive. The Acapulco trade was\r\nfast on the wane, and the Manila Spanish merchants were anxious to get\r\nthe local trade into their own hands. Every Chinese shop was closed\r\nby Government order, and a joint-stock trading company of Spaniards\r\nand half-breeds was formed with a capital of P76,500, in shares of\r\nP500 each. Stores were opened in the business quarter, each under the\r\ncontrol of two Spaniards or half-breeds, the total number of shopmen\r\nbeing 21. The object of the company was to purchase clothing and\r\nstaple goods of all kinds required in the Islands, and to sell the\r\nsame at 30 per cent. over cost price. Out of the 30 per cent. were to\r\nbe paid an 8 per cent. tax, a dividend of 10 per cent. per annum to\r\nthe shareholders, and the remainder was to cover salaries and form a\r\nreserve fund for new investments. The company found it impossible to\r\nmake the same bargains with the Chinese sellers as the Chinese buyers\r\nhad done, and a large portion of the capital was soon lost. The\r\nfunds at that date in the _Obras Pias_ amounted to P159,000, and\r\nthe trustees were applied to by the company for financial support,\r\nwhich they refused. The Governor was petitioned; theologians and\r\nmagistrates were consulted on the subject. The theological objections\r\nwere overruled by the judicial arguments, and the Governor ordered\r\nthat P130,000 of the _Obras Pias_ funds should be loaned to the\r\ncompany on debentures; nevertheless, within a year the company failed.\r\n\r\nA commercial company, known as the \"_Compania Guipuzcoana de\r\nCaracas_,\" was then created under royal sanction, and obtained\r\ncertain privileges. During the term of its existence, it almost\r\nmonopolized the Philippine-American trade, which was yet carried on\r\nexclusively in the State galleons. On the expiration of its charter,\r\nabout the year 1783, a petition was presented to the Home Government,\r\npraying for a renewal of monopolies and privileges in favour of a new\r\ntrading corporation, to be founded on a modified basis. Consequently,\r\na charter (_Real cedula_) was granted on March 10, 1785, to a company,\r\nbearing the style and title of the \"_Real Compania de Filipinas_.\" Its\r\ncapital was P8,000,000, in 32,000 shares of P250 each. King Charles\r\nIII. took up 4,000 shares; another 3,000 shares were reserved for the\r\nfriars and the Manila Spanish or native residents, and the balance\r\nwas allotted in the Peninsula.\r\n\r\nThe defunct company had engaged solely in the American trade, employing\r\nthe galleons; its successor left that sphere of commerce and proposed\r\nto trade with the East and Europe.\r\n\r\n[117] \"To the '_Real Compania de Filipinas_' was conceded the\r\nexclusive privilege of trade between Spain and the Archipelago,\r\nwith the exception of the traffic between Manila and Acapulco. Its\r\nships could fly the Royal Standard, with a signal to distinguish them\r\nfrom war-vessels. It was allowed two years, counting from the date of\r\ncharter, to acquire foreign-built vessels and register them under the\r\nSpanish flag, free of fees. It could import, duty free, any goods for\r\nthe fitting out of its ships, or ships' use. It could take into its\r\nservice royal naval officers, and, whilst these were so employed,\r\ntheir seniority would continue to count, and in all respects they\r\nwould enjoy the same rights as if they were serving in the navy. It\r\ncould engage foreign sailors and officers, always provided that the\r\ncaptain and chief officer were Spaniards. All existing Royal Decrees\r\nand Orders, forbidding the importation into the Peninsula of stuffs\r\nand manufactured articles from India, China, and Japan were abrogated\r\nin favour of this company. Philippine produce, too, shipped to Spain\r\nby the company, could enter duty free. The prohibition on direct\r\ntraffic with China and India was thenceforth abolished in favour of all\r\nManila merchants, and the company's ships in particular could call at\r\nChinese ports. The company undertook to support Philippine agriculture,\r\nand to spend, with this object, 4 per cent, of its nett profits.\"\r\n\r\nIn order to protect the company's interests, foreign ships were not\r\nallowed to bring goods from Europe to the Philippines, although they\r\ncould land Chinese and Indian wares.\r\n\r\nBy the Treaties of Tordesillas and Antwerp (q.v.), the Spaniards\r\nhad agreed that to reach their Oriental possessions they would\r\ntake only the Western route, which would be _via_ Mexico or round\r\nCape Horn. These treaties, however, were virtually quashed by\r\nKing Charles III. on the establishment of the \"_Real Compania de\r\nFilipinas_.\" Holland only lodged a nominal protest when the company's\r\nships were authorized to sail to the Philippines _via_ the Cape of\r\nGood Hope, for the Spaniards' ability to compete had, meanwhile,\r\nvastly diminished.\r\n\r\nWith such important immunities, and the credit which ought to have\r\nbeen procurable by a company with P8,000,000 paid-up capital, its\r\noperations might have been relatively vast. However, its balance\r\nsheet, closed to October 31, 1790 (five-and-a-half years after it\r\nstarted), shows the total nominal assets to be only P10,700,194,\r\nlargely in unrecoverable advances to tillers. The working account is\r\nnot set out. Although it was never, in itself, a flourishing concern,\r\nit brought immense benefit to the Philippines (at the expense of its\r\nshareholders) by opening the way for the Colony's future commercial\r\nprosperity. This advantage operated in two ways. (1) It gave great\r\nimpulse to agriculture, which thenceforth began to make important\r\nstrides. By large sums of money, distributed in anticipation of the\r\n4 per cent, on nett profit, and expended in the rural districts, it\r\nimparted life, vigour and development to those germs of husbandry--such\r\nas the cultivation of sugar-cane, tobacco, cotton, indigo, pepper,\r\netc.--which, for a long time had been, and to a certain extent are\r\nstill, the staple dependence of many provinces. (2) It opened the\r\nroad to final extinction of all those vexatious prohibitions of trade\r\nwith the Eastern ports and the Peninsula which had checked the energy\r\nof the Manila merchants. It was the precursor of free trade--the\r\nstepping-stone to commercial liberty in these regions.\r\n\r\nThe causes of its decline are not difficult to trace. Established as\r\nit was on a semi-official basis, all kinds of intrigues were resorted\r\nto--all manner of favouritism was besought--to secure appointments,\r\nmore or less lucrative, in the _Great Company_. Influential incapacity\r\nprevailed over knowledge and ability, and the men intrusted with the\r\ndirection of the company's operations proved themselves inexperienced\r\nand quite unfit to cope with unshackled competition from the outer\r\nworld. Their very exclusiveness was an irresistible temptation to\r\ncontrabandists. Manila private merchants, viewing with displeasure\r\nmonopoly in any form, lost no opportunity of putting obstacles in\r\nthe way of the company. Again, the willing concurrence of native\r\nlabourers in an enterprise of magnitude was as impossible to secure\r\nthen as it is now. The native had a high time at the expense of the\r\ncompany, revelling in the enjoyment of cash advances, for which some\r\ngave little, others nothing. Success could only have been achieved\r\nby forced labour, and this right was not included in the charter.\r\n\r\nIn 1825 the company was on the point of collapse, when, to support\r\nthe tottering fabric, its capital was increased by P12,500,000 under\r\n_Real Cedula_ of that year, dated June 22. King Charles IV. took\r\n15,772 (P250) shares of this new issue. But nothing could save the\r\nwreck, and finally it was decreed, by _Real Cedula_ of May 28, 1830,\r\nthat the privileges conceded to the \"_Real Compania de Filipinas_\"\r\nhad expired--and Manila was then opened to Free Trade with the whole\r\nworld. It marked an epoch in Philippine affairs.\r\n\r\nIn 1820 the declared independence of Mexico, acknowledged subsequently\r\nby the European Powers, forced Spain to a decision, and direct trade\r\nbetween the Philippines and the mother country became a reluctant\r\nnecessity. No restrictions were placed on the export to Spain of\r\ncolonial produce, but value limitations were fixed with regard to\r\nChinese goods. The export from the Philippines to Acapulco, Callao,\r\nand other South American ports was limited to P750,000 at that date. In\r\nthe same year (1820) permission was granted for trade between Manila\r\nand the Asiatic ports. Twenty-two years afterwards one-third of all\r\nthe Manila export trade was done with China.\r\n\r\nWhen the galleons fell into disuse, communication was definitely\r\nestablished with Spain by merchant sailing ships _via_ the Cape of\r\nGood Hope, whilst the opening of the Suez Canal (1869) brought the\r\nPhilippines within 32 days' journey by steamer from Barcelona.\r\n\r\nThe voyage _via_ the Cape of Good Hope occupied from three to six\r\nmonths; the sailings were less frequent than at the present day, and\r\nthe journey was invariably attended with innumerable discomforts. It\r\nwas interesting to hear the few old Spanish residents, in my time,\r\ncompare their privations when they came by the Cape with the luxurious\r\nfacilities of later times. What is to-day a pleasure was then a\r\nhardship, consequently the number of Spaniards in the Islands was\r\nsmall; their movements were always known. It was hardly possible for\r\na Spaniard to acquire a sum of money and migrate secretly from one\r\nisland to another, and still less easy was it for him to leave the\r\nColony clandestinely.\r\n\r\nThe Spaniard of that day who settled in the Colony usually became\r\nwell known during the period of the service which brought him to\r\nthe Far East. If, after his retirement from public duty, on the\r\nconclusion of his tenure of office, he decided to remain in the\r\nColony, it was often due to his being able to count on the pecuniary\r\nsupport and moral protection of the priests. The idea grew, so that\r\nneedy Spaniards in the Philippines, in the course of time, came\r\nto entertain a kind of socialistic notion that those who had means\r\nought to aid and set up those who had nothing, without guarantee of\r\nany kind: \"_Si hubiera quien me proteja!_\" was the common sigh--the\r\noutcome of Caesarism nurtured by a Government which discountenanced\r\nindividual effort. Later on, too, many natives seemed to think that\r\nthe foreign firms, and others employing large capital, might well\r\nbecome philanthropic institutions, paternally assisting them with\r\nunsecured capital. The natives were bred in this moral bondage:\r\nthey had seen trading companies, established under royal sanction,\r\nbenefit the few and collapse; they had witnessed extensive works,\r\nundertaken _por via de administracion_ miscarry in their ostensible\r\nobjects but prosper in their real intent, namely, the providing of\r\nberths for those who lived by their wits.\r\n\r\nThe patriarchal system was essayed by a wealthy firm of American\r\nmerchants (Russell & Sturgis) with very disastrous results to\r\nthemselves. They distributed capital all over the Colony, and the\r\nnatives abused their support in a most abominable manner. A native,\r\nalleging that he had opened up a plantation, would call on the firm\r\nand procure advances against future crops after scant inquiry. Having\r\nonce advanced, it was necessary to continue doing so to save the\r\nfirst loans.\r\n\r\nUnder the auspices of the late Mr. Nicholas Loney, great impulse was\r\ngiven to the commerce of Yloilo, and, due to his efforts, the Island\r\nof Negros was first opened up. His memory is still revered, and he is\r\noften spoken of as the original benefactor to the trading community\r\nof that district. Russell & Sturgis subsequently extended their\r\noperations to that locality. The result was that they were deceived in\r\nevery direction by the natives, who, instead of bringing in produce\r\nto pay off advances, sent their sons to college, built fine houses,\r\nbought pianos, jewellery, etc., and in a hundred ways satisfied their\r\npride and love for outward show in a manner never known before, at\r\nthe expense of the American capitalists. As bankers, the firm enjoyed\r\nthe unlimited confidence of those classes who had something to lose as\r\nwell as to gain; hence it is said that, the original partners having\r\nwithdrawn their money interest, the firm endeavoured to continue\r\nthe business with a working capital chiefly derived from the funds\r\ndeposited by private persons at 8 per cent, per annum. All might\r\nhave gone well but for the rascality of the native agriculturists,\r\nwho brought about the failure of the house in 1875 by taking loans\r\nand delivering no produce. The news amazed everybody. Trade was,\r\nfor the moment, completely paralyzed. The great firm, which for years\r\nhad been the mainspring of all Philippine mercantile enterprise, had\r\nfailed! But whilst many individuals suffered (principally depositors\r\nat interest), fifty times as many families to-day owe their financial\r\nposition to the generosity of the big firm; and I could mention the\r\nnames of half a dozen real-estate owners in Yloilo Province who,\r\nhaving started with nothing, somehow found themselves possessing\r\ncomparatively large fortunes at the time of the liquidation.\r\n\r\nConsequent on the smash, a reaction set in which soon proved beneficial\r\nto the Colony at large. Foreign and Spanish houses of minor importance,\r\nwhich had laboured in the shade during the existence of the great\r\nfirm, were now able to extend their operations in branches of trade\r\nwhich had hitherto been practically monopolized.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBefore Manila was opened to foreign trade, even in a restricted form,\r\nspecial concessions appear to have been granted to a few traders. One\r\nwriter mentions that a French mercantile house was founded in Manila\r\nmany years prior to 1787, and that an English firm obtained permission\r\nto establish itself in 1809. In 1789 a foreign ship was allowed to\r\nenter the port of Manila and to discharge a cargo. This would appear\r\nto have been the first. In olden times the demand for ordinary foreign\r\ncommodities was supplied by the Chinese traders and a few Americans\r\nand Persians. During the latter half of the 18th century a Spanish\r\nman-of-war occasionally arrived, bringing European manufactures for\r\nsale, and loaded a return cargo of Oriental goods.\r\n\r\nThe Philippine Islands were but little known in the foreign markets\r\nand commercial centres of Europe before the middle of the 19th\r\ncentury. Notwithstanding the special trading concessions granted to\r\none foreigner and another from the beginning of last century, it was\r\nnot until the port of Manila was unrestrictedly opened to resident\r\nforeign merchants in 1834 that a regular export trade with the whole\r\nmercantile world gradually came into existence.\r\n\r\nIt is said that whilst the charter of the \"_Real Compania\r\nde Filipinas_\" was still in force (1785-1830) a Mr. Butler [118]\r\nsolicited permission to reside in and open up a trade between Manila\r\nand foreign ports; but his petition was held to be monstrous and\r\ngrievously dangerous to the political security of the Colony; hence it\r\nwas rejected. The Spaniards had had very good reason to doubt foreign\r\nintercourse after their experience of 1738, when they preferred a\r\nwar with England to a gross abuse of the _Asiento_ contract entered\r\ninto under the Treaty of Utrecht. [119] Subsequently the American firm\r\nalready mentioned, Russell & Sturgis, made a request to be allowed to\r\ntrade, which, having the support of the Gov.-General of the day, was\r\ngranted; and Mr. Butler, taking advantage of this recent precedent,\r\nalso succeeded in founding a commercial house in Manila. To these\r\nforeigners is due the initiation of the traffic in those products\r\nwhich became the staple trade of the Colony and paved the way for the\r\nbulk of the business being, as it is to-day, in the hands of European\r\nand American merchants.\r\n\r\nThe distrustful sentiment of olden times (justifiable in the 18th\r\ncentury) pervaded the Spaniards' commercial and colonial policy up to\r\ntheir last day. Proposed reforms and solicitations for permission\r\nto introduce modern improvements were by no means welcomed. In\r\nthe provinces clerical opposition was often cast against liberal\r\ninnovations, and in the Government bureaux they were encompassed with\r\nobstructive formalities, objections, and delays. [120]\r\n\r\nBy Royal Ordinance of 1844 strangers were excluded from the interior;\r\nin 1857 unrepealed decrees were brought forward to urge the prohibition\r\nof foreigners to establish themselves in the Colony; and, as late\r\nas 1886, their trading here was declared to be \"prejudicial to the\r\nmaterial interests of the country.\" [121]\r\n\r\nThe support of the friars referred to in p. 255 became a thing of\r\nthe past. Colonists had increased tenfold, the means of communication\r\nand of exit were too ample for the security of the lenders, who, as\r\nmembers of religious communities, could not seek redress at law, and,\r\nmoreover, those \"lucky hits\" which were made by penniless Europeans\r\nin former times by pecuniary help \"just in the nick of time\" were\r\nno longer possible, for every known channel of lucrative transaction\r\nwas in time taken up by capitalists.\r\n\r\nIt was the capital brought originally to the Philippines through\r\nforeign channels which developed the modern commerce of the Colony,\r\nand much of the present wealth of the inhabitants engaged in trade\r\nand agriculture is indirectly due to foreign enterprise. Negros Island\r\nwas entirely opened up by foreign capital. In Manila, the fathers of\r\nmany of the half-castes and pure natives who at this day figure as\r\nmen of position and standing, commenced their careers as messengers,\r\nwarehouse-keepers, clerks, etc., of the foreign houses.\r\n\r\nThere were a great many well-to-do Spaniards in trade, but few whose\r\nfunds on starting were brought by them from the Peninsula. The first\r\nSpanish steamer-owner in the Colony, a baker by trade, owed his\r\nprosperity to the support of Russell & Sturgis. One of the richest\r\nSpanish merchants (who died in 1894) once kept a little grocer's shop,\r\nand after the failure of Russell & Sturgis he developed into a merchant\r\nand shipowner whose firm became, in time, the largest Spanish house\r\noperating in hemp and other produce.\r\n\r\nAbout 14 Spanish firms of a certain importance were established in\r\nManila, Yloilo, and Cebu, in addition to the Europeans trading here\r\nand there on the coasts of the Islands. In Manila there were (and\r\nare still) two foreign bank branches [122] (one with a sub-branch in\r\nYloilo), three bank agencies, and the Philippine private banking-house\r\nof J. M. Tuason & Co.; also the \"Banco Espanol-Filipino,\" which was\r\ninstituted in 1852, with a capital of P400,000, in 2,000 shares of\r\nP200 each. The capital was subsequently increased to P600.000. [123]\r\nAuthorized by charter, it issued notes payable to bearer on demand from\r\nP10 upwards. The legal maximum limit of note issue was P1,200,000,\r\nwhilst the actual circulation was about P100,000 short of that\r\nfigure. This bank did a very limited amount of very secure business,\r\nand it has paid dividends of 12 to 15 per cent.; hence the shares were\r\nalways at a premium. In 1888, when 12 per cent, dividend was paid,\r\nthis stock was quoted at P420; in 1895 it rose to P435. The _Obras\r\nPias_ funds (_vide_ p. 245) constituted the orginal capital of the\r\nbank. The new position of this institution, under the (American)\r\nInsular Government since 1905, is explained in Chapter xxxi.\r\n\r\nThe first Philippine bank was opened in Manila by a certain Francisco\r\nRodriguez about the year 1830.\r\n\r\nFrom the conquest up to the year 1857 there was no Philippine\r\ncoinage. Mexican dollars were the only currency, and in default of\r\nsubsidiary money these dollars, called _pesos_, were cut. In 1764 cut\r\nmoney was prohibited, and small Spanish silver and copper coins came\r\nto the Islands. In 1799 the Gov.-General forbade the exportation of\r\nmoney, and fixed the peso at 8 _reales fuertes_ and the _real_ at\r\n17 _cuartos._ Shortly afterwards gold came to the Islands, and was\r\nplentiful until 1882. In 1837 other copper coins came from Spain,\r\nand the _real fuerte_ was fixed at 20 _cuartos_. In 1857 the Manila\r\nmint was established, _pesetas_ were introduced, five being equal to\r\none peso, and 32 cuartos being equal to one peseta. Contemporaneously\r\nthe coinage in Spain was 34 cuartos to one peseta and 5 pesetas to\r\none _duro_--the coin nominally equivalent to the peso--but the duro\r\nbeing subdivided into 20 _reales vellon_, the colonial real fuerte\r\ncame to be equivalent to 2 1/2 reales vellon. The evident intention\r\nwas to have one common nominal basis (peso and duro), but subdivided\r\nin a manner to limit the currency of the colonial coinage to its own\r\nlocality. With pesos, reales, cuartos, maravedis, and ounces of gold,\r\nbookkeeping was somewhat complicated; however, the Government accounts\r\nwere rendered easy by a decree dated January 17, 1857, which fixed\r\npesos and cents for official reckoning. Merchants then adopted this\r\nstandard. Up to 1860 gold was so abundant that as much as 10 per cent,\r\nwas paid to exchange an _onza_ of gold (P16) for silver. In 1878 gold\r\nand silver were worth their nominal relative values. Gold, however,\r\nhas gradually disappeared from the Colony, large quantities having\r\nbeen exported to China. In 1881 the current premium for purchasing\r\ngold was 2 per cent., and at the beginning of 1885 as much as 10 per\r\ncent. premium was paid for Philippine gold of the Isabella II or\r\nany previous coinage. The gold currency of Alfonso XII. (1875-85)\r\nwas always of less intrinsic value than the coin of earlier date,\r\nthe difference averaging about 2 per cent. At the present day gold\r\ncould only be obtained in very limited quantities at about the same\r\nrate as sight drafts on Europe. Philippine gold pieces are rare.\r\n\r\nIn 1883 Mexican dollars of a later coinage than 1877 were called\r\nin, and a term was fixed after which they would cease to be legal\r\ntender. In 1885 decimal bronze coins were introduced. In July, 1886,\r\na decree was published calling in all foreign and Chinese chop dollars\r\n[124] within six months, after which date the introducer of such coin\r\ninto the Colony would be subject to the penalty of a fine equal to\r\n20 per cent. of the value imported, the obligation to immediately\r\nre-export the coin, and civil action for the misdemeanour. At the\r\nexpiration of the six months the Treasury was not in a position to\r\neffect the conversion of the foreign medium in private hands prior\r\nto the publication of the decree. The term was extended, but in time\r\nthe measure became practically void, so far as the legal tender was\r\nconcerned. However, the importation of Mexican dollars was still\r\nprohibited; but, as they remained current in Manila at par value,\r\nwhilst in Hong-Kong and Singapore they could be bought for 8 to 12\r\nper cent, (and in 1894 25 per cent.) less than Manila dollars, large\r\nquantities were smuggled into the Colony. It is estimated that in the\r\nyear 1887 the clandestine introduction of Mexican dollars into Manila\r\naveraged about P150,000 per month. I remember a Chinaman was caught in\r\nSeptember, 1887, with P164,000, imported in cases declared to contain\r\nmatches. In 1890 there was a \"boom\" in the silver market. Owing to\r\nthe action of the American Silverites, the Washington Treasury called\r\nfor a monthly supply of 4,000,000 of silver dollars; consequently\r\nsight rate on London in Hong-Kong touched 3s. 10 1/4d., and in Manila\r\nrose to 3s. 10 1/2d., but a rapid reaction set in when the Treasury\r\ndemand ceased. In 1895 we heard in Manila that the Government were\r\nabout to coin Philippine pesos and absolutely demonetize Mexicans\r\nas a medium in the Islands. But this measure was never carried out,\r\nprobably because the Government had not the necessary cash with\r\nwhich to effect the conversion. Some few Philippine peso pieces were,\r\nhowever, put into circulation concurrently with the Mexican pesos.\r\n\r\nIn June, 1903, the ss. _Don Juan_, owned by Francisco L. Rojas, of\r\nManila, took on board in Hong-Kong about $400,000 Mexicans (i.e.,\r\npesos) for the purpose of smuggling them into Manila. On board there\r\nwere also, as passengers, a Senor Rodoreda and a crowd of Chinese\r\ncoolies. The vessel caught fire off the west coast of Luzon. The\r\ncaptain, the crew, and the Spanish passenger abandoned the ship in\r\nboats, leaving the Chinese to their awful fate. A steam launch was\r\nsent alongside and saved a few dollars, whilst the despairing Chinese\r\nbecame victims to the flames and sharks. The ship's burnt-out hull\r\nwas towed to Manila Bay. The remaining dollars were confiscated,\r\nand the captain and chief engineer were prosecuted.\r\n\r\nThe universal monetary crisis due to the depreciation of silver was\r\nexperienced here, and the Government made matters still worse by\r\ncoining half-pesos and 20-cent pieces, which had not the intrinsic\r\nvalue expressed, and exchange consequently fell still lower. In\r\nSeptember, 1887, a Madrid periodical, _Correo de Espana_, stated that\r\nthe bastard Philippine 50-cent pieces were rejected in Madrid even by\r\nmoney-changers. In May, 1888, the peso was quoted at 3s.2 3/4d. (over\r\n19 per cent. below nominal value), and shippers to the Colony, who\r\nhad already suffered considerably by the loss on exchange, had their\r\ninterests still further impaired by this action of the Treasury. For\r\nExchange Fluctuations _vide_ Chap, xxxi., \"Trade Statistics.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nA Custom-house was established and port opened in Zamboanga (Mindanao\r\nIs.) for direct communication with abroad in 1831; those of Sual\r\n(Pangasinan) and Yloilo (Panay Is.) in 1855, and that of Cebu in\r\n1863. The Custom-house of Sual was subsequently abolished, and the\r\nport having been closed to direct foreign trade, the place has lost\r\nits former importance, and lapsed into the state of a lifeless village.\r\n\r\nSpecial permission could be obtained for ships to load in and sail\r\ndirect from harbours where no Custom-houses were established, on a\r\nsum of money being lodged beforehand at the _Caja de Depositos _in\r\nManila, to cover duties, dues, etc., to be assessed.\r\n\r\nAfter the opening of the port of Yloilo, three years elapsed before a\r\ncargo of produce sailed thence to a foreign port. Since then it has\r\ngradually become the shipping centre for the crops (chiefly sugar\r\nand sapanwood) raised in the islands of Panay and Negros. From\r\nabout the year 1882 to 1897 it attracted a portion of what was\r\nformerly the Cebu trade. Since then the importance of Yloilo has\r\ndiminished. Its development as a port was entirely due to foreigners,\r\nand considerably aided agriculture in the Visayas Islands. Heretofore\r\nthe small output of sugar (which had never reached 1,000 tons in\r\nany year) had to be sent up to Manila. The expense of local freight,\r\nbrokerages, and double loading and discharging left so little profit\r\nto the planters that the results were then quite discouraging. None\r\nbut wooden sugar-cane mills were employed at that time, but since\r\nthen many small steam-power factories have been erected (_vide_\r\nSugar). The produce shipped in Yloilo [125] was principally carried\r\nto the United States in American sailing-ships.\r\n\r\nFor figures relating to Chief Exports from the various ports, _vide_\r\nChap. xxxi., \"Trade Statistics.\"\r\n\r\nMost of the carrying Import trade was in the hands of subsidized\r\nSpanish steamer-owners, whilst the larger portion of the Exports was\r\nconveyed in foreign vessels, which arrived in ballast from Eastern\r\nports where they had left cargoes.\r\n\r\nSmuggling was carried on to a considerable extent for years, and in\r\n1891 a fresh stimulus was given to contraband by the introduction of a\r\nProtectionist Tariff, which came into force on April 1 of that year,\r\nand under which Spanish goods brought in Spanish ships were allowed\r\nto enter free of duty. [126]\r\n\r\nIn order to evade the payment of the Manila Port Works Tax (q.v.), for\r\nwhich no value was given, large quantities of piece-goods for Manila\r\nwere shipped from Europe to Yloilo, passed through the Custom-house\r\nthere and re-shipped in inter-island steamers to Manila. In 1890 some\r\ntwo-thirds of the Yloilo foreign imports were for re-shipment.\r\n\r\nThe circumstances which directly led to the opening of Zamboanga (in\r\n1831) as a commercial port are interesting when it is remembered that\r\nMindanao Island is still quasi-independent in the interior--inhabited\r\nby races unconquered by the Spaniards, and where agriculture by\r\ncivilized settlers is as yet nascent. It appears that the Port of Jolo\r\n(Sulu Is.) had been, for a long time, frequented by foreign ships,\r\nwhose owners or officers (chiefly British) unscrupulously supplied the\r\nSulus with sundry manufactured goods, including _arms of warfare_,\r\nmuch to the detriment of Spanish interests there, in exchange for\r\nmother-of-pearl, pearls, gums, etc. The Spaniards claimed suzerain\r\nrights over the island, but were not strong enough to establish and\r\nprotect a Custom-house, so they imposed the regulation that ships\r\nloading in Jolo should put in at Zamboanga for clearance to foreign\r\nports. The foreigners who carried on this illicit traffic protested\r\nagainst a sailing-ship being required to go out of her homeward\r\ncourse about one hundred and twenty miles for the mere formality\r\nof customs clearance. A British ship (and perhaps many before her)\r\nsailed straight away from Jolo, in defiance of the Spaniards, and\r\nthe matter was then brought to the notice of the British Government,\r\nwho intimated that either Jolo must be declared a free port or a\r\nCustom-house must be established there. The former alternative was\r\nchosen by the Spaniards, but Zamboanga remained an open port for\r\nforeign trade which very rarely came.\r\n\r\nThe supreme control of merchant shipping and naval forces was\r\nvested in the same high official. No foreigner was permitted to own\r\na vessel trading between Spain and her colonies, or between one\r\nSpanish colony and another, or doing a coasting trade within the\r\nColony. This difficulty was however readily overcome, and reduced to\r\na mere ineffective formality, by foreigners employing Spaniards to\r\nbecome nominal owners of their vessels. Thus a very large portion of\r\nthe inter-island steamer carrying-trade was virtually conducted by\r\nforeigners, chiefly British.\r\n\r\nMail-steamers, subsidized by the Government, left the capital every\r\nfortnight for the different islands, and there was a quarterly Pacific\r\nMail Service to the Ladrone Islands. [127] Regular mails arrived from,\r\nand left for, Europe every fortnight, but as there were intermediate\r\nopportunities of remitting and receiving correspondence, really\r\nabout three mails were received and three despatched every month. The\r\nmail-route for Europe is _via_ Singapore, but there were some seven\r\nor eight sailings of steamers per month between Manila and Hong-Kong\r\n(the nearest foreign colony--640 miles), whence mails were forwarded\r\nto Europe, Australia, Japan, the United States, etc.\r\n\r\nBetween the capital and several ports in the adjacent provinces there\r\nwas a daily service of passenger and light cargo-steamers.\r\n\r\nBetween Yloilo and the adjoining Province of Antique, the District\r\nof Concepcion and the Islands of Negros and Cebu, there were some\r\nhalf-dozen small steamers, belonging to Filipinos and Spaniards,\r\nrunning regularly with passengers and merchandise, whilst in the\r\nsugar-producing season--from January to May--they were fully freighted\r\nwith cargoes of this staple article.\r\n\r\nThe carrying-trade in sailing craft between the Islands was chiefly\r\nin the hands of natives and half-castes. There were also a few Spanish\r\nsailing-ship owners, and in the Port of Yloilo a few schooners (called\r\n_lorchas_), loading from 40 to 100 tons of sugar, were the property\r\nof foreigners, under the nominal ownership of Spanish subjects,\r\nfor the reasons mentioned in the preceding page.\r\n\r\nThe principal exporters employ middlemen for the collecting of produce,\r\nand usually require their guarantee for sales at credit to the\r\nprovincial purchasers of imports. These middlemen are always persons\r\nof means, born in the Colony, and, understanding both the intricacies\r\nof the native character and the European mode of transacting business,\r\nthey serve as very useful--almost indispensable--intermediaries.\r\n\r\nIt was only when the crisis in the Sugar trade affected the whole\r\nworld, and began to be felt in the Philippines in 1884, that the\r\nmajority of the natives engaged in that industry slowly began to\r\nunderstand that the current price of produce fluctuated according\r\nto supply and demand. Before transactions were so thoroughly in the\r\nhands of middlemen, small producers used to take their samples to the\r\npurchasers, \"to see how much they cared to pay\" as they expressed\r\nit--the term \"market price\" seldom being used or understood in the\r\nprovinces, because of the belief that prices rose or fell according\r\nto the caprice or generosity of the foreign buyer. Accustomed to\r\ndeal, during the first centuries of the Spanish occupation, with the\r\nChinese, the natives, even among themselves, rarely have fixed prices\r\nin retail dealings, and nearly every quotation in small traffic is\r\ntaken only as a fancy price, subject to considerable rebate before\r\nclosing. The Chinese understand the native pretty well; they study his\r\nlikings, and they so fix their prices that an enormous reduction can\r\nbe made for his satisfaction. He goes away quite contented, whilst\r\nthe Chinaman chuckles over having got the best of the bargain. Even\r\nthe import houses, when they advertise their goods for sale, seldom\r\nstate the prices; it seems as if all regarded the question of price\r\nas a shifty one.\r\n\r\nThe system of giving credit in the retail trade of Manila, and a few\r\nprovincial towns, was the ruin of many shopkeepers. There were few\r\nretailers who had fixed prices; most of them fluctuated according to\r\nthe race, or nationality, of the intending customer. The Chinese dealer\r\nmade no secret about his price being merely nominal. If on the first\r\noffer the hesitating purchaser were about to move away, he would call\r\nafter him and politely invite him to haggle over the bargain. [128]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe only real basis of wealth in the Colony is the raw material\r\nobtained by Agriculture, and Forest produce. Nothing was done by the\r\nconquerors to foster the Industrial Arts, and the Manufacturing Trades\r\nwere of insignificant importance. Cigars were the only _manufactured_\r\nexport staple, whilst perfumes, a little cordage, and occasionally\r\na parcel of straw or finely-split bamboo hats were shipped.\r\n\r\nIn the Provinces of Bulacan and Pampanga, split-cane and Nito\r\n(_lygodium_) hats, straw mats, and cigar-cases are made. Some of\r\nthe finest worked cigar-cases require so much time for making that\r\nthey cost up to P20 each. Hats can only be obtained in quantities by\r\nshippers through native middlemen.\r\n\r\nIn Yloilo Province a rough cloth called _Sinamay_ is woven [129]\r\nfrom selected hemp fibre. Also in this province and that of Antique\r\n(Panay Is.), _Pina_ muslin of pure pine-leaf fibre and _Husi_ of mixed\r\npine-leaf and hemp filament are made. Ilocos Province has a reputation\r\nin these Islands for its woollen and dyed cotton fabrics. Taal\r\n(Batangas) also produces a special make of cotton stuffs. Pasig,\r\non the river of that name, and Sulipan (Pampanga), are locally known\r\nfor their rough pottery, and Capiz and Romblon for their sugar-bags.\r\n\r\nPaete, at the extreme east of the Laguna de Bay, is the centre for\r\nwhite-wood furniture and wood-carving. In Mariquina, near Manila,\r\nwooden clogs and native leather shoes are made. Santa Cruz (Manila)\r\nis the gold and silver-workers' quarter. The native women in nearly\r\nall the civilized provinces produce some very handsome specimens of\r\nembroidery on European patterns. Mats to sleep upon (_petates_) straw\r\nbags (_bayones_), baskets (_tampipes_), alcohol, bamboo furniture,\r\nbuffalo-hide leather, wax candles, soap, etc., have their centres of\r\nmanufacture on a small scale. The first Philippine brewery was opened\r\nOctober 4, 1890, in San Miguel (Manila) by Don Enrique Barretto,\r\nto whom was granted a monopoly by the Spanish Government for twenty\r\nyears. It is now chiefly owned by a Philippine half-caste, Don Pedro\r\nP. Rojas (resident in Paris), who formed it into a company which has\r\nbecome a very flourishing concern. Philippine capital alone supports\r\nthese manufactures. The traffic and consumption being entirely local,\r\nthe consequent increase of wealth to the Colony is the economized\r\ndifference between them and imported articles. These industries bring\r\nno fresh capital to the Colony, by way of profits, but they contribute\r\nto check its egress by the returns of agriculture changing hands to\r\nthe local manufacturer instead of to the foreign merchant.\r\n\r\nWant of cheap means of land-transport has, so far, been the chief\r\ndrawback to Philippine manufactures, which are of small importance\r\nin the total trade of the Colony.\r\n\r\nPhilippine railways were first officially projected in 1875,\r\nwhen a Royal Decree of that year, dated August 6, determined the\r\nlegislative basis for works of that nature. The Inspector of Public\r\nWorks was instructed to form a general plan of a railway system\r\nin Luzon Island. The projected system included (1) a line running\r\nnorth from Manila through the Provinces of Bulacan, Pampanga, and\r\nPangasinan. (2) A line running south from Manila, along the Laguna\r\nde Bay shore and eastwards through Tayabas, Camarines, and Albay\r\nProvinces. (3) A branch from this line on the Laguna de Bay shore to\r\nrun almost due south to Batangas. The lines to be constructed were\r\nclassed under two heads, viz.:--(1) Those of general public utility\r\nto be laid down either by the State or by subsidized companies, the\r\nconcession in this case being given by the Home Government; and (2)\r\nthose of private interest, for the construction of which concessions\r\ncould be granted by the Gov.-General.\r\n\r\nIn 1885 the Government solicited tenders for the laying of the\r\nfirst line of railway from Manila to Dagupan--a port on the Gulf\r\nof Lingayen, and the only practicable outlet for produce from the\r\nProvince of Pangasinan and Tarlac District. The distance by sea\r\nis 216 miles--the railway line 196 kilometres (say 120 miles). The\r\nsubsidy offered by the Government amounted to about P7,650 per mile,\r\nbut on three occasions no tender was forthcoming either from Madrid\r\nor in Manila, where it was simultaneously solicited. Subsequently\r\na modified offer was made of a guaranteed annual interest of 8 per\r\ncent, on a maximum outlay of P4,964,473.65, and the news was received\r\nin Manila in October, 1886, that the contract had been taken up by\r\na London firm of contractors. The prospectus of \"The Manila Railway\r\nCo., Ltd,\" was issued in February, 1888. The line was to be completed\r\nwithin four years from July 21, 1887, and at the end of ninety-nine\r\nyears the railway and rolling-stock were to revert to the Spanish\r\nGovernment without compensation. The rails, locomotives (36 tons and\r\n12 tons each), tenders, coaches, waggons, and ironwork for bridges all\r\ncame from England. The first stone of the Central Station in Manila\r\n(Bilibid Road, Tondo) was laid by Gov.-General Emilio Terrero on July\r\n31, 1887. In 1890 the original contractors failed, and only the first\r\nsection of 28 miles was opened to traffic on March 24, 1891.\r\n\r\nMany other circumstances, however, contributed to delay the opening\r\nof the whole line. Compensation claims were very slowly agreed to;\r\nthe Government engineers slightly altered the plans; the company's\r\nengineers could not find a hard strata in the bed of the Calumpit\r\nRiver [130] (a branch of the Rio Grande de Pampanga) on which to\r\nbuild the piers of the bridge; and lastly the Spanish authorities,\r\nwho had direct intervention in the work, found all sorts of excuses\r\nfor postponing the opening of the line. When the Civil Director was\r\napplied to, he calmly replied that he was going to the baths, and\r\nwould think about it. Finally, on appeal to the highest authority,\r\nGov.-General Despujols himself went up to Tarlac, and in an energetic\r\nspeech, reflecting on the dilatoriness of his subordinates, he declared\r\nthe first Philippine railway open to traffic on November 23, 1892. For\r\nabout a year and a half passengers and goods were ferried across the\r\nCalumpit River in pontoons. Large caissons had to be sunk in the river\r\nin which to build the piers for the iron bridge, which cost an enormous\r\nsum of money in excess of the estimate. Later on heavy rains caused\r\na partial inundation of the line, the embankment of which yielded to\r\nthe accumulated mass of water, and traffic to Dagupan was temporarily\r\nsuspended. The total outlay on the line far exceeded the company's\r\noriginal calculation, and to avert a financial collapse fresh capital\r\nhad to be raised by the issue of 6 per cent. Prior Lien Mortgage Bonds,\r\nranking before the debenture stock.

On January 26, 1895, these\r\nshares were officially quoted, for sellers, 0.\r\n\r\nIncluding the termini in Manila (Tondo) and Dagupan, there are 29\r\nstations and 16 bridges along the main line, over which the journey\r\noccupies eight hours. There are two branch lines, viz.:--from Bigaa\r\nto Cabanatuan (Nueva Ecija), and from Angeles (Pampanga) to Camp\r\nStotsenberg. From the Manila terminus there is a short line (about a\r\nmile) running down to the quay in Binondo for goods traffic only. The\r\ncountry through which this line passes is flat, and has large natural\r\nresources, the development of which--without a railway--had not been\r\nfeasible owing to the ranges of mountains--chiefly the Cordillera of\r\nZambales--which run parallel to the coast.\r\n\r\nThe railway is ably managed, but when I travelled on it in 1904 much\r\nof the rolling-stock needed renewal.\r\n\r\nIn 1890, under Royal Order No. 508, dated June 11 of that year, a 99\r\nyears' concession was granted to a British commercial firm in Manila\r\nto lay a 21-mile line of railway, without subsidy, from Manila to\r\nAntipolo, to be called the \"Centre of Luzon Railway.\" The work was to\r\nbe commenced within one year and finished within two years. The basis\r\nof the anticipated traffic was the conveyance of pilgrims to the Shrine\r\nof Our Lady of Good Voyage and Peace (_vide_ p. 184); but, moreover,\r\nthe proposed line connected the parishes of Dilao (then 4,380 pop.),\r\nSanta Ana (then 2,115 pop.), Mariquina (then 10,000 pop.), Cainta\r\n(then 2,300 pop.), and Taytay (then 6,500 pop.)--branching to Pasig\r\nand Angono--with Antipolo (then 3,800; now 2,800 pop.). The estimated\r\noutlay was about P1,000,000, but the concession was abandoned. The\r\nproject has since been revived under American auspices.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nUnder Spanish government there was a land Telegraph Service from Manila\r\nto all civilized parts of Luzon Island--also in Panay Island from Capiz\r\nto Yloilo, and in Cebu Island from the city of Cebu across the Island\r\nand up the west coast as far north as Tuburan. There was a land-line\r\nfrom Manila to Bolinao (Zambales), from which point a submarine cable\r\nwas laid in April, 1880, by the Eastern Extension Australasia and\r\nChina Telegraph Company, Ltd., whereby Manila was placed in direct\r\ntelegraphic communication with the rest of the world. For this\r\nservice the Spanish Government paid the company P4,000 a month for\r\na period of 10 years, which expired in June, 1890. In April, 1898,\r\nthe same company detached the cable from Bolinao and carried it on\r\nto Manila in the s.s. _Sherard Osborn_, 207 nautical miles having\r\nbeen added to the cable for the purpose. In return for this service\r\nthe Spanish Government gave the company certain exclusive rights and\r\nvaluable concessions. In May, 1898, the American Admiral Dewey ordered\r\nthe Manila-Hong-Kong cable to be cut, but the connection was made\r\ngood again after the Preliminaries of Peace with Spain were signed\r\n(August 12, 1898). Cable communication was suspended, therefore,\r\nfrom May 2 until August 21 of that year.\r\n\r\nIn 1897 another submarine cable was laid by the above company,\r\nunder contract with the Spanish Government, connecting Manila with\r\nthe Southern Islands of Panay and Cebu (Tuburan). The Manila-Panay\r\ncable was also cut by order of Admiral Dewey (May 23, 1898), but after\r\nAugust 12, under an arrangement made between the American and Spanish\r\nGovernments, it was re-opened on a neutral basis, and the company's\r\nown staff worked it direct with the Manila public, instead of through\r\nthe medium of Spanish officials.\r\n\r\nSince the American occupation a new cable connecting the Islands\r\nwith the United States has been laid (opened July 4, 1903), whilst a\r\nnetwork of submarine and land-wires has been established throughout\r\nthe Archipelago.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOwing to their geographical position, none of the Philippine ports\r\nare on the line of the regular mail and passenger steamers _en route_\r\nelsewhere; hence, unlike Hong-Kong, Singapore, and other Eastern ports,\r\nthere is little profit to be derived from a cosmopolitan floating\r\npopulation. Due, probably, to the tedious Customs regulations--the\r\nobligation of every person to procure, and carry on his person, a\r\ndocument of identification--the requirement of a passport to enter\r\nthe Islands, and complicated formalities to recover it on leaving--the\r\nabsence of railroads and hotels in the interior and the difficulties of\r\ntravelling--this Colony, during the Spanish _regime_, was apparently\r\noutside the region of tourists and \"globe-trotters.\" Indeed the\r\nPhilippine Archipelago formed an isolated settlement in the Far East\r\nwhich traders or pleasure-seekers rarely visited _en passant_ to\r\nexplore and reveal to the world its natural wealth and beauty. It was\r\na Colony comparatively so little known that, forty years ago, fairly\r\neducated people in England used to refer to it as \"The Manillas,\"\r\nwhilst up to the end of Spanish rule old residents, on visiting\r\nSingapore and Hong-Kong, were often highly amused by the extravagant\r\nnotions which prevailed, even there, concerning the Philippines. But\r\nthe regulations above referred to were an advantage to the respectable\r\nresident, for they had the desirable effect of excluding many of those\r\nnondescript wanderers and social outcasts who invade other colonies.\r\n\r\nSince the Revolution there has been a large influx of American tourists\r\nto the Islands, arriving in the army-transports, passage free, to see\r\n\"the new possession,\" as the Archipelago is popularly called in the\r\nUnited States.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVI\r\n\r\nAgriculture\r\n\r\n\r\nIn years gone by, before so many colonies were opened up all over\r\nthe world, the few who, in the Philippines, had the courage to face\r\nthe obstacles to agriculture in a primitive country made fairly large\r\nfortunes in the main staple products--sugar and hemp. Prices were then\r\ntreble what they have since been, labour was cheaper, because the needs\r\nof the labouring-class were fewer, and, owing to the limited demand\r\nand the rarity of epidemic cattle-disease, buffaloes for tilling were\r\nworth one-eighth of what they cost at the present day. Although the\r\namount of trade was vastly less, those natives engaged in it were in\r\nsounder positions than the same class generally is now.\r\n\r\nWithin the last few years there are hundreds who have embarked in\r\nagricultural enterprises with only one-tenth of the capital necessary\r\nto make them successful. A man would start planting with only a few\r\nhundred pesos and a tract of cleared land, without title-deeds, and\r\nconsequently of no negotiable value. In the first year he inevitably\r\nfell into the hands of money-lenders, who reasonably stipulated for a\r\nvery high rate of interest in view of the absence of guarantees. The\r\nrates of interest on loans under such circumstances varied as a rule\r\nfrom 12 to 24 per cent. I know a Visayo native who, by way of interest,\r\ncommission, and charges, demanded as much as 30 per cent. I need not\r\nrefer to the isolated cases which have come to my knowledge of over\r\n100 per cent. being charged. As at the present day agriculture in\r\nthe Philippines does not yield 30 per cent. nett profit, it naturally\r\nfollows that the money-lender at this rate has to attach the estate\r\nupon which he has made loans, and finally becomes owner of it. In\r\nthe meantime, the tiller who has directed the labour of converting a\r\ntract of land into a plantation, simply gets a living out of it. Some\r\nfew were able to disencumber their property by paying, year by year,\r\nnot only the whole of the nett returns from the plantation, but also\r\nthe profits on small traffic in which they may have speculated. It\r\nseldom happened, however, that the native planter was sufficiently\r\nloyal to his financial supporter to do this: on the contrary, although\r\nhe might owe thousands of pesos, he would spend money in feasts, and\r\nundertake fresh obligations of a most worthless nature. He would buy\r\non credit, to be paid for after the next crop, a quantity of paltry\r\njewellery from the first hawker who passed his way, or let the cash\r\nslip out of his hands at the cock-pit or the gambling-table.\r\n\r\nEven the most provident seemed to make no reserve for a bad year, and\r\nthe consequence was that in 1887 I think I may safely assert that if\r\nall the Philippine planters had had to liquidate within twelve months,\r\ncertainly 50 per cent. of them would have been insolvent. One of\r\nthe most hazardous businesses in the Colony is that of advancing to\r\nthe native planters, unless it be done with the express intention of\r\neventually becoming owner of an estate, which is really often the case.\r\n\r\nThe conditions of land-tenure in Luzon Island under Spanish rule\r\nstood briefly thus:--The owners either held the lands by virtue of\r\nundisturbed possession or by transferable State grant. The tenants--the\r\nactual tillers--were one degree advanced beyond the state of slave\r\ncultivators, inasmuch as they could accumulate property and were free\r\nto transfer their services. They corresponded to that class of farmers\r\nknown in France as _metayers_ and amongst the Romans of old as _Coloni\r\nPartiarii_, with no right in the land, but entitled to one-half of its\r\nproduce. Like the ancients, they had to perform a number of services\r\nto the proprietor which were not specified in writing, but enforced\r\nby usage. Tenants of this kind recently subsisted--and perhaps\r\nstill do--in Scotland (_vide_ \"Wealth of Nations,\" by Adam Smith,\r\nedition of 1886, p. 160). Leases for long periods were exceptional,\r\nand I never heard of compensation being granted for improvements of\r\nPhilippine estates. The conditions in Visayas are explained on p. 274.\r\n\r\nThe value of land suitable for _Sugar-cane_ growing varies\r\nconsiderably, being dependent on proximity to a port, or sugar-market,\r\nand on quality, facilities for drainage, transport, site, boundaries,\r\netc.\r\n\r\nIn the Province of Bulacan, land which in a great measure is exhausted\r\nand yields only an average of 21 tons of cane per acre, was valued\r\n(prior to the American occupation), on account of its nearness to\r\nthe capital, at P115 per acre. In Pampanga Province, a little further\r\nnorth, the average value of land, yielding, say, 30 tons of cane per\r\nacre, was P75 per acre. Still further north, in the Province of Nueva\r\nEcija, whence transport to the sugar-market is difficult and can only\r\nbe economically effected in the wet season by river, land producing\r\nan average of 35 tons of cane per acre would hardly fetch more than\r\nP30 per acre. Railroads will no doubt eventually level these values.\r\n\r\nIn reality, Bulacan land is priced higher than its intrinsic value as\r\nascertained by yield and economy of produce-transport. The natives\r\nare, everywhere in the Colony, more or less averse to alienating\r\nreal estate inherited from their forefathers, and as Bulacan is one\r\nof the first provinces where lands were taken up, centuries ago, an\r\nattachment to the soil is particularly noticeable. In that province,\r\nas a rule, only genuine necessity, or a fancy price far in excess of\r\nproducing-worth, would induce an owner to sell his land.\r\n\r\nLand grants were obtainable from the Spanish Government by proving\r\npriority of claim, but the concession was only given after wearisome\r\ndelay, and sometimes it took years to obtain the title-deeds. Then\r\nlarge capital was requisite to utilize the property, the clearance\r\noften costing more than the virgin tract, whilst the eviction of\r\nsquatters was a most difficult undertaking: \"_J'y suis et j'y reste_,\"\r\nthought the squatter, and the grantee had no speedy redress at law. On\r\nthe other hand, the soil is so wonderfully rich and fertile that the\r\nstudy of geoponics and artificial manuring was never thought essential.\r\n\r\nThe finest sugar-cane producing island in the Archipelago is Negros,\r\nin the Visaya district, between N. latitudes 9 deg. and 11 deg.. The area\r\nof the Island is about equal to that of Porto Rico, but for want of\r\ncapital is only about one-half opened up. Nevertheless, it sent to\r\nthe Yloilo market in 1892 over 115,000 tons of raw sugar--the largest\r\ncrop it has yet produced. In 1850 the Negros sugar yield was 625 tons.\r\n\r\nThe price of uncleared land there, suitable for sugar-cane cultivation,\r\nin accessible spots, was, say, P35 per acre, and cleared land might\r\nbe considered worth about P70 per acre. The yield of sugar-cane may\r\nbe estimated at 40 tons per acre on the estates opened up within the\r\nlast ten years, whilst the older estates produce per acre nearly 30\r\ntons of cane, but of a quality which gives such a high-class sugar\r\nthat it compensates for the decrease in quantity, taking also into\r\naccount the economy of manipulating and transporting less bulk.\r\n\r\nOtaheiti cane (yellow) is generally planted in Luzon, whilst Java cane\r\n(red) is most common in the southern islands. _Tubo_ is the Tagalog\r\ngeneric name for sugar-cane.\r\n\r\nThe following equivalents of Philippine land-measures may be useful,\r\nviz.:--\r\n\r\n\r\n    1 Quinon        = 40,000 square varas = 10,000 square brazas.\r\n                    = 5 cabans = 6.9444 acres = 2.795 hectares.\r\n\r\n    1 Balita        = 4,000 square varas = 1,000 square brazas.\r\n                    = .69444 acre = .2795 hectare.\r\n\r\n    1 Loan          = 400 square varas = 100 square brazas.\r\n                    = .06944 acre = .02795 hectare.\r\n\r\n    1 Square Braza  = 3.3611 square English yards.\r\n                    = 4,355.98 square English inches.\r\n\r\n    1 Square Vara   = .8402 square English yards.\r\n                    = 1,088.89 square English inches.\r\n\r\n    1 Acre          = 5,760 square varas = 1.44 balitas.\r\n                    = .72 caban = .404671 hectare.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe average yield of sugar per acre is about as follows, viz.:--\r\n\r\n\r\nPampanga Province,\r\n    say @ 6 1/2% extraction                 = 1.95 Tons of Sugar.\r\nOther Northern provinces,\r\n    say @ 5 1/2% extraction                 = 1.65 Tons of Sugar.\r\nNegros Island (with almost exclusively European mills),\r\n    say @ 7 1/2% extraction                 = 2.75 Tons of Sugar.\r\n\r\n\r\nFrom Yloilo the sugar is chiefly exported to the United States,\r\nwhere there is a demand for raw material only from the Philippines\r\nfor the purpose of refining, whilst from Manila a certain\r\nquantity of crystal-grain sugar is sent, ready for consumption,\r\nto Spain. Consequently, in the Island of Luzon, a higher class of\r\nmachinery is employed. In 1890 there were five private estates, with\r\nvacuum-pans erected, and one refinery, near Manila, (at Malabon). Also\r\nin 1885 the Government acquired a sugar-machinery plant with vacuum-pan\r\nfor their model estate at San Ramon in the Province of Zamboanga; the\r\nsugar turned out at the trial of the plant in my presence was equal\r\nto 21 D. S. of that year. Convict labour was employed. During the\r\nRebellion half the machinery on this estate was destroyed or stolen.\r\n\r\nIt is a rare thing to see other than European mills in the Island of\r\nNegros, whilst in every other sugar-producing province roughly-made\r\nvertical cattle-mills of wood, or stone (wood in the south and stone\r\nin the north), as introduced by the Chinese, are still in use. With\r\none exception (at Cabanatuan, Nueva Ecija), which was a failure,\r\nthe triple-effect refining-plant is altogether unknown in this Colony.\r\n\r\nThe sugar-estates generally are small. There are not a dozen estates\r\nin the whole Colony which produce over 1,000 tons of raw sugar each\r\nper season. An estate turning out 500 tons of sugar is considered a\r\nlarge one. I know of one estate which yielded 1,500 tons, and another\r\n1,900 tons in a good season. In the Island of Negros there is no port\r\nsuitable for loading ships of large tonnage, and the crops have to\r\nbe carried to the Yloilo market, in small schooners loading from 40\r\nto 100 tons (_vide_ p. 263). From the estates to the coast there are\r\nneither canals nor railroads, and the transport is by buffalo-cart.\r\n\r\nThe highest tablelands are used for cane-planting, which imperatively\r\nrequires a good system of drainage. In Luzon Island the output of sugar\r\nwould be far greater if more attention were paid to the seasons. The\r\ncane should be cut in December, and the milling should never last over\r\nten weeks. The new cane-point setting should be commenced a fortnight\r\nafter the milling begins, and the whole operation of manufacture\r\nand planting for the new crop should be finished by the middle of\r\nMarch. A deal of sugar is lost by delay in each branch of the field\r\nlabour. In the West Indies the planters set the canes out widely,\r\nleaving plenty of space for the development of the roots, and the\r\nratoons serve up to from five to twenty years. In the Philippines\r\nthe setting of cane points is renewed each year, with few exceptions,\r\nand the planting is comparatively close.\r\n\r\nBulacan sugar-land, being more exhausted than Pampanga land, will\r\nnot admit of such close planting, hence Bulacan land can only find\r\nnourishment for 14,300 points per acre, whilst Pampanga land takes\r\n17,800 points on average computation.\r\n\r\nIn Negros, current sugar is raised from new lands (among the best) and\r\nfrom lands which are hardly considered suitable for cane-planting. Good\r\nlands are called \"new\" for three crops in Negros, and during that\r\nperiod the planting is close, to choke the cane and prevent it becoming\r\naqueous by too rapid development.\r\n\r\nIn the Northern Philippines \"clayed\" sugar (Spanish, _Azucar de pilon_)\r\nis made. The _massecuite_, when drawn from the pans, is turned into\r\nearthenware conic pots containing about 150 lb. weight. When the mass\r\nhas set, the pot is placed over a jar (Tagalog, _oya_) into which the\r\nmolasses drains. In six months, if allowed to remain over the jar,\r\nit will drain about 20 per cent, of its original weight, but it is\r\nusually sold before that time, if prices are favourable.\r\n\r\nThe molasses is sold to the distilleries for making Alcohol,\r\n[131] whilst there is a certain demand for it for mixing with the\r\ndrinking-water given to Philippine ponies, although this custom is\r\nnow falling into disuse, in Manila at least, because molasses is\r\nnever given to the American imported horses.\r\n\r\nFrom nine tests which I made with steam machinery, of small capacity,\r\nin different places in the northern provinces, without interfering\r\nwith the customary system of manipulating the cane or the adjustment\r\nof the mill rolls, I found the--\r\n\r\n\r\n    Average juice extraction to be                      56.37%\r\n    Average moisture in the megass on leaving the mill  23.27%\r\n    Average amount of dry megass [132]                  20.36%\r\n                                                       100.00%\r\n\r\n\r\nThe average density of juice in the cane worked off as above was 10\r\n3/4 deg. Beaume.\r\n\r\nIn Negros the process is very different. The juice is evaporated\r\nin the pan-battery to a higher point of concentration, so that the\r\nmolasses becomes incorporated with the saccharine grain. It is then\r\nturned out into a wooden trough, about 8 feet long by 4 feet wide,\r\nand stirred about with shovels, until it has cooled so far as to be\r\nunable to form into a solid mass, or lumps. When quite cold, the few\r\nlumps visible are pounded, and the whole is packed in grass bags\r\n(_bayones_). Sugar packed in this way is deliverable to shippers,\r\nwhereas \"clayed\" sugar can only be sold to the assorters and packers\r\n(_farderos_), who sun-dry it on mats and then bag it after making up\r\nthe colour and quality to exporter's sample (_vide_ p. 173).\r\n\r\nThe Labour system in the Northern Philippines is quite distinct\r\nfrom that adopted in the South. The plantations in the North are\r\nworked on the co-operative principle (_sistema de inquilinos_). The\r\nlandowner divides his estate into tenements (_aparcerias_), each tenant\r\n(_aparcero_) being provided with a buffalo and agricultural implements\r\nto work up the plot, plant, and attend to the cane-growth as if it\r\nwere his own property. Wherever the native goes to work he carries the\r\nindispensable bowie-knife (Tagalog, _guloc_; Spanish, _bolo_). When\r\nthe cutting-season arrives, one tenant at a time brings in his cane\r\nto the mill, and when the sugar is worked off, usually one-third,\r\nbut often as much as one-half of the output, according to arrangement,\r\nbelongs to the tenant. The tenant provides the hands required for the\r\noperations of cane-crushing and sugar-making; the cost of machinery\r\nand factory establishment is for the account of the landowner, who\r\nalso has to take the entire risk of typhoons, inundations, drought,\r\nlocusts, [133] etc.\r\n\r\nDuring the year, whilst the cane is maturing, the tenants receive\r\nadvances against their estimated share, some even beyond the real\r\nvalue, so that, in nearly every case, the full crop remains in the\r\nhands of the estate-owner. In the general working of the plantation\r\nhired day-labour is not required, the tenants, in fact, being\r\nregarded, in every sense, as servants of the owner, who employs them\r\nfor whatever service he may need. Interest at 10 to 12 per cent. per\r\nannum is charged upon the advances made in money, rice, stuffs, etc.,\r\nduring the year; and on taking over the tenant's share of output,\r\nas against these advances, a rebate on current price of the sugar is\r\noften agreed to.\r\n\r\nIn the South, plantations are worked on the daily-wages system,\r\n(_sistema de jornal_), and the labourer will frequently exact his\r\npay for several weeks in advance. Great vigilance is requisite,\r\nand on estates exceeding certain dimensions it is often necessary to\r\nsubdivide the management, apportioning it off to overseers, or limited\r\npartners, called \"Axas.\" Both on European and native owners' estates\r\nthese _axas_ were often Spaniards. The _axas'_ interest varies on\r\ndifferent properties, but, generally speaking, he is either credited\r\nwith one-third of the product and supplied with necessary capital,\r\nor he receives two-thirds of the yield of the land under his care and\r\nfinds his own working capital for its tilth, whilst the sunk capital in\r\nland, machinery, sheds, stores, etc., is for the account of the owner.\r\n\r\nIn 1877 a British company--the \"Yengarie\"--was started with a large\r\ncapital for the purpose of acquiring cane-juice all over the Colony\r\nand extracting from it highly-refined sugar. The works, fitted with\r\nvacuum-pans and all the latest improvements connected with this class\r\nof apparatus, were established at Mandaloyan, about three miles from\r\nManila up the Pasig River. From certain parts of Luzon Island the\r\njuice was to be conveyed to the factory in tubes, and the promoter,\r\nwho visited Cebu Island, proposed to send schooners there fitted with\r\ntanks, to bring the defecated liquid to Mandaloyan. The project was\r\nan entire failure from the beginning (for the ordinary shareholders\r\nat least), and in 1880 the machinery plant was being realized and\r\nthe company wound up.\r\n\r\nThe classification of sugar in the South differs from that in the\r\nNorth. In the former market it is ranked as Nos. 0, 1, 2, 3 Superior\r\nand Current. For the American market these qualities are blended,\r\nto make up what is called \"Assorted Sugar,\" in the proportion\r\nof one-eighth of No. 1, two-eighths of No. 2, and five-eighths\r\nof No. 3. In the North the quality is determined on the Dutch\r\nstandard. The New York and London markets fix the prices, which are\r\ncabled daily to the foreign merchants in Manila.\r\n\r\nFrom a series of estimates compiled by me I find that to produce\r\n7,000 to 10,000 piculs, the cost laid down in Yloilo would be, say,\r\nP2.00 per picul (P32.00 per ton); the smaller the output the larger\r\nis the prime cost, and _vice-versa._\r\n\r\nFortunes have been made in this Colony in cane-sugar, and until the\r\nend of 1883 sugar-planting paid the capitalist and left something to\r\nthe borrowing planter; now it pays only interest on capital. From\r\nthe year 1884 the subsidized beet-root sugar manufacturers on the\r\ncontinent of Europe turned out such enormous quantities of this article\r\nthat the total yield of sugar exceeded the world's requirements. The\r\nconsequence was that the cane-sugar manufacture declined almost at\r\nthe same ratio as that of beet-root advanced, as will be seen from\r\nthe subjoined figures:--\r\n\r\n\r\n                                                             Tons.\r\n\r\n    The world's production in 1880; cane sugar          3,285,714\r\n    The world's production in 1880; beet sugar          1,443,349\r\n                                                        =========\r\n                                                        4,729,063\r\n\r\n                                                            Tons.\r\n    The world's production in 1887, cane sugar          2,333,004\r\n    The world's production in 1887, beet sugar          2,492,610\r\n                                                        =========\r\n                                                        4,825,614\r\n\r\n                                                             Tons.\r\n    Beet sugar                  Increase                1,049,261\r\n    Cane sugar                  Decrease                  952,710\r\n\r\n    The world's output was      Increased                  96,551\r\n\r\n\r\nSince the above date, however, the output of Beet Sugar has become\r\nabout double that of Cane Sugar, as will be seen from the following\r\nfigures, viz.:--\r\n\r\n\r\n    World's Production.

Since the American\r\noccupation the cost of labour, living, material, live-stock, and all\r\nthat the planter or his estate need, has increased so enormously that\r\nthe colonist should ponder well before opening up a new estate for\r\ncane-growing in world-wide competition. For figures of Sugar Shipments\r\n_vide_ Chap, xxxi., \"Trade Statistics.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_Rice_ (_Oryza_) being the staple food of the Filipinos, it is\r\ncultivated more or less largely in every province of the Colony. Its\r\nmarket value fluctuates considerably according to the stocks in\r\nhand and the season of the year. It appears to be the only branch\r\nof agriculture in which the lower classes of natives take a visible\r\npleasure and which they understand thoroughly. In 1897 about 80,000\r\ntons were raised.\r\n\r\nThe natives measure and sell rice (Tagalog, _bigas_) and paddy\r\n(Tagalog, _palay_) by the caban and its fractions; the caban dry\r\nmeasure is as follows, viz:--\r\n\r\n4 Apatans = 1 Chupa; 8 Chupas = 1 Ganta; 25 Gantas = 1 Caban,\r\n\r\nthe equivalent of which in English measure is thus, viz:--\r\n\r\n\r\n            1 Atapan =   .16875 of a pint.\r\n            1 Chupa  =   .675 of a pint.\r\n            1 Ganta  =  2 quarts, 1 2/5 pints.\r\n            1 Caban  = 16 gallons, 3 quarts, 1 pint.\r\n\r\n\r\nRice of foreign importation is weighed and quoted by the picul of\r\n133 1/3 lbs. avoirdupois, subdivided as follows, viz.:--\r\n\r\n16 Taels = 1 Catty; 10 Catties = 1 Chinanta; 10 Chinantas = 1 Picul.\r\n\r\nThirty years ago rice was exported from the Philippines, but now not\r\neven sufficient is produced for home consumption, hence this commodity\r\nis imported in large quantities from Siam, Lower Burmah, and Cochin\r\nChina to supply the deficiency. In 1897 nearly 65,000 tons of rice\r\nwere brought from those countries, and since the American occupation\r\nthe annual receipts of foreign rice have increased to fivefold. Sual\r\n(Pangasinan), on the Gulf of Lingayen, was, thirty-five years ago,\r\na port of importance, whence rice was shipped to China (_vide_\r\np. 261). This falling off of rice-production did not, however,\r\nimply a loss to the population in Spanish times when imported rice\r\nwas sold cheaply, because, in many provinces, land formerly used for\r\nrice-growing was turned to better account for raising other crops\r\nwhich paid better in a fairly good market.\r\n\r\nThe natives everywhere continue to employ the primitive method of\r\ntreating rice-paddy for domestic and local use. The grain is generally\r\nhusked by them in a large mortar hewn from a block of _molave_,\r\nor other hardwood, in which it is beaten by a pestle. Sometimes\r\ntwo or three men or women with wooden pestles work at the same\r\nmortar. This mortar is termed, in Tagalog dialect, _Luzon_, the name\r\ngiven to the largest island of the group. However, I have seen in\r\nthe towns of Candava (Pampanga), Pagsanjan (La Laguna), near Calamba\r\nin the same province, in Naig (Cavite), in Camarines Province, and\r\na few other places, an attempt to improve upon the current system\r\nby employing an ingenious wooden mechanical apparatus worked by\r\nbuffaloes. It consisted of a vertical shaft on which was keyed a\r\nbevel-wheel revolving horizontally and geared into a bevel pinion\r\nfixed upon a horizontal shaft. In this shaft were adjusted pins,\r\nwhich, at each revolution, caught the corresponding pins in vertical\r\nsliding columns. These columns (five or six)--being thereby raised\r\nand allowed to fall of their own weight when the raising-pins had\r\npassed on--acted as pounders, or pestles, in the mortars placed below\r\nthem. Subsequently, notable progress was made in Camarines Province\r\nby Spaniards, who, in 1888, employed steam power, whilst in Pagsanjan\r\n(La Laguna) animal motive power was substituted by that of steam. Also,\r\nnear Calamba, in the same province, water power was eventually employed\r\nto advantage. In Negros, near the village of Candaguit, there was\r\none small rice-machinery plant worked by steam power, brought by a\r\nSpaniard from Valencia in Spain. Presumably it was not a success,\r\nas it remained only a short time in use.\r\n\r\nFinally the Manila-Dagupan Railway gave a great stimulus to\r\nthe rice-husking and pearling industry, which was taken up by\r\nforeigners. There are now important rice steam-power mills established\r\nat Calumpit, Gerona, Moncada, Bayambang, and other places along the\r\nline from Calumpit towards Dagupan, which supply large quantities of\r\ncleaned rice to Manila and other provinces, where it is invariably\r\nmore highly appreciated than the imported article. Also, at Nueva\r\nCaceres (Camarines), in 1896, a large steam-power rice mill was being\r\nworked by Don Manuel Pardo, who had a steamer specially constructed\r\nin Hong-Kong for the transport of his output to the provincial markets.\r\n\r\nThe average yield of cleaned rice from the paddy is 50 per cent.,\r\nwhilst no special use is found for the remaining 50 per cent. of coarse\r\npaddy-bran. The fine bran, almost dust (called in Tagalog _Tiki Tiki_),\r\nserves, however, for several purposes on the farm. The rice grain\r\nwhich is broken in the husking is known as _Pinaua_ in Tagalog.\r\n\r\nThe customary charge for husking and winnowing a caban of paddy is\r\n12 1/2 cents, so that as two cabans of paddy give one caban of rice,\r\nthe cost of this labour would be 25 cents per caban of rice.\r\n\r\nThe average amount of rice consumed by a working man per day is\r\nestimated at four chupas, or, say, close upon eight cabans per annum,\r\nwhich, on the old reckoning--that is to say in Spanish times, taking\r\nan average price of 1 peso per caban of paddy = 2 pesos per caban\r\nof rice, plus 25 cents for cleaning = 2.25 pesos per caban of clean\r\nrice--amounts to 18 pesos per annum. A native's further necessities\r\nare fish, an occasional piece of buffalo, betel-nut, tobacco, six\r\nyards of cotton print-stuff, and payment of taxes, all of which\r\n(including rice) amounted to say P50 in the year, so that a man\r\nearning 20 cents per day during 300 days lived well, provided he had\r\nno unforeseen misfortunes. Cock-fighting and gambling of course upset\r\nthe calculation.\r\n\r\nThere are, it is said, over 20 different kinds of rice-paddy. These\r\nare comprised in two common groups--the one is called _Macan_ rice\r\n(Spanish, _Arroz de Semillero_) which is raised on alluvial soil\r\non the lowlands capable of being flooded conveniently with water,\r\nand the other has the general denomination (in Luzon Is.) of _Paga_\r\nor _Dumali_ (Spanish, _Arroz de Secano_) and is cultivated on high\r\nlands and slopes where inundation is impracticable.\r\n\r\nThe _Macan_, or low-land rice, is much the finer quality, the grain\r\nbeing usually very white, although _Macan_ rice is to be found\r\ncontaining up to 25 per cent. of red grain, known in Tagalog as\r\n_Tangi_, or _Malagcquit_. The white grain is that most esteemed. The\r\nyield of grain varies according to the quality of the soil. In the\r\nnorth of Bulacan Province the average crop of _Macan_ rice may be\r\ntaken at 80 cabans of grain for one caban of seed. In the south of\r\nthe same province the return reaches only one-half of that. In the\r\neast of Pampanga Province, in the neighbourhood of Arayat, Magalang,\r\nand Candava villages, the yield is still higher, giving, in a good\r\nyear, as much as 100 cabans for one of seed. In Negros a return of\r\n50 cabans to one may be taken as a fair average.\r\n\r\n_Paga_ rice always shows a large proportion of red grain, and the\r\nreturn is, at the most, half that of _Macan_ yield, but whilst rarely\r\nmore than one crop per annum is obtained from low-lands (_Macan_\r\nrice)--taking the average throughout the Islands--in most places up\r\nto three crops of _Paga_ rice can be obtained.\r\n\r\nBesides the ordinary agricultural risks to which rice cultivation is\r\nexposed, a special danger often presents itself. The _Paga_ rice is\r\nfrequently attacked by flies (Tagalog, _Alutangia_), which suck the\r\nflower just before seeding, and the person in charge of the plantation\r\nhas to stroll in the evenings and mornings among the setting to whisk\r\noff these insects with a bunch of straws on the end of a stick, or\r\ncatch them with a net to save the grain. Both _Macan_ and _Paga_\r\nare sometimes damaged by an insect, known in Ilocos Province as\r\n_Talibatab_, which eats through the stalk of the plant before maturity,\r\ncausing the head, or flower, to droop over and wither, but this does\r\nnot happen every season.\r\n\r\nTo plant _Macan_ rice the grain or seed is sown in the month of June\r\non a piece of land called the \"seeding-plot,\" where, in six weeks,\r\nit attains a height of about one foot, and, provided the rains have\r\nnot failed, it is then pulled up by the roots and transplanted, stem\r\nby stem, in the flooded fields. Each field is embanked with earth\r\n(Tagalog, _pilapil_) so that the water shall not run off, and just\r\nbefore the setting is commenced, the plough is passed for the last\r\ntime. Then men, women, and children go into the inundated fields\r\nwith their bundles of rice-plant and stick the stalks in the soft\r\nmud one by one. It would seem a tedious operation, but the natives\r\nare so used to it that they quickly cover a large field. In four\r\nmonths from the transplanting the rice is ripe, but as at the end of\r\nNovember there is still a risk of rain falling, the harvest is usually\r\ncommenced at the end of December, after the grain has hardened and\r\nthe dry season has fairly set in. If, at such an abnormal period, the\r\nrains were to return (and such a thing has been known), the sheaves,\r\nwhich are heaped for about a month to dry, would be greatly exposed\r\nto mildew owing to the damp atmosphere. After the heaping--at the\r\nend of January--the paddy, still in the straw, is made into stacks\r\n(Tagalog, _Mandala_). In six weeks more the grain is separated from\r\nthe straw, and this operation has to be concluded before the next\r\nwet season begins--say about the end of April. On the Pacific coast\r\n(Camarines and Albay), where the seasons are reversed (_vide_ p. 22),\r\nrice is planted out in September and reaped in February.\r\n\r\nThe separation of the grain is effected in several ways. Some beat\r\nit out with their feet, others flail it, whilst in Cavite Province\r\nit is a common practice to spread the sheaves in a circular enclosure\r\nwithin which a number of ponies and foals are trotted.\r\n\r\nIn Negros Island there is what is termed _Ami_ rice--a small crop\r\nwhich spontaneously rises in succession to the regular crop after\r\nthe first ploughing.\r\n\r\nIt seldom happens that a \"seeding-plot\" has to be allowed to run to\r\nseed for want of rain for transplanting, but in such an event it is\r\nsaid to yield at the most tenfold.\r\n\r\nNothing in Nature is more lovely than a valley of green half-ripened\r\nrice-paddy, surrounded by verdant hills. Rice harvest-time is a lively\r\none among the poor tenants in Luzon, who, as a rule, are practically\r\nthe landowner's partners working for half the crop, against which they\r\nreceive advances during the year. Therefore, cost of labour may be\r\ntaken at 50 per cent. plus 10 per cent. stolen from the owner's share.\r\n\r\nPaddy-planting is not a lucrative commercial undertaking, and few\r\ntake it up on a large scale. None of the large millers employing\r\nsteam power are, at the same time, grain cultivators. There is this\r\nadvantage about the business, that the grower is less likely to be\r\nconfronted with the labour difficulty, for the work of planting out\r\nand gathering in the crop is, to the native and his family, a congenial\r\noccupation. Rice-cultivation is, indeed, such a poor business for the\r\ncapitalist that perhaps a fortune has never been made in that sole\r\noccupation, but it gives a sufficient return to the actual tiller\r\nof his own land. The native woman is often quite as clever as her\r\nhusband in managing the estate hands, for her tongue is usually as\r\neffective as his rattan. I venture to say there are not six white\r\nmen living who, without Philippine wives, have made fortunes solely\r\nin agriculture in these Islands.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVII\r\n\r\nManila Hemp--Coffee--Tobacco\r\n\r\n\r\n_Hemp_ (_Musa textilis_)--referred to by some scientific\r\nwriters as _M. troglodytarum_--is a wild species of the plantain\r\n(_M. paradisiaca_) found growing in many parts of the Philippine\r\nIslands. It so closely resembles the _M. paradisiaca,_ which bears\r\nthe well-known and agreeable fruit--the edible banana, that only\r\nconnoisseurs can perceive the difference in the density of colour and\r\nsize of the green leaves--those of the hemp-plant being of a somewhat\r\ndarker hue, and shorter. The fibre of a number of species of _Musa_\r\nis used for weaving, cordage, etc., in tropical countries.\r\n\r\nThis herbaceous plant seems to thrive best on an inclined plane,\r\nfor nearly all the wild hemp which I have seen has been found on\r\nmountain slopes, even far away down the ravines. Although requiring a\r\nconsiderable amount of moisture, hemp will not thrive in swampy land,\r\nand to attain any great height it must be well shaded by other trees\r\nmore capable of bearing the sun's rays. A great depth of soil is not\r\nindispensable for its development, as it is to be seen flourishing\r\nin its natural state on the slopes of volcanic formation. In Albay\r\nProvince it grows on the declivities of the Mayon Volcano.\r\n\r\nThe hemp-tree in the Philippines reaches an average height of 10\r\nfeet. It is an endogenous plant, the stem of which is enclosed in\r\nlayers of half-round petioles. The hemp-fibre is extracted from these\r\npetioles, which, when cut down, are separated into strips, five to six\r\ninches wide, and drawn under a knife attached at one end by a hinge to\r\na block of wood, whilst the other end is suspended to the extremity\r\nof a flexible stick. The bow tends to raise the knife, and a cord,\r\nattached to the same end of the knife, and a treadle are so arranged\r\nthat by a movement of the foot the operator can bring the knife to\r\nwork on the hemp petiole with the pressure he chooses. The bast is\r\ndrawn through between the knife and the block, the operator twisting\r\nthe fibre, at each pull, around a stick of wood or his arm, whilst the\r\nparenchymatous pulp remains on the other side of the knife. There is\r\nno use for the pulp. The knife should be without teeth or indentations,\r\nbut nearly everywhere in Capis Province I have seen it with a slightly\r\nserrated edge. The fibre is then spread out to dry, and afterwards\r\ntightly packed in bales with iron or rattan hoops for shipment.\r\n\r\nA finer fibre than the ordinary hemp is sometimes obtained in\r\nsmall quantities from the specially-selected edges of the petiole,\r\nand this material is used by the natives for weaving. The quantity\r\nprocurable is limited, and the difficulty in obtaining it consists\r\nin the frequent breakage of the fibre whilst being drawn, due to\r\nits comparative fragility. Its commercial value is about double\r\nthat of ordinary first-class cordage hemp. The stuff made from this\r\nfine fibre (in Bicol dialect, _Lupis_) suits admirably for ladies'\r\ndresses. Ordinary hemp fibre is used for the manufacture of coarse\r\nnative stuff, known in Manila as _Sinamay_, much worn by the poorer\r\nclasses of natives; large quantities of it come from Yloilo. In Panay\r\nIsland a kind of texture called _Husi_ is made of a mixture of fine\r\nhemp (_lupis_) and pine-apple leaf fibre. Sometimes this fabric is\r\npalmed off on foreigners as pure _pina_ stuff, but a connoisseur\r\ncan easily detect the hemp filament by the touch of the material,\r\nthere being in the hemp-fibre, as in horsehair, a certain amount of\r\nstiffness and a tendency to spring back which, when compressed into a\r\nball in the hand, prevents the stuff from retaining that shape. _Pina_\r\nfibre is soft and yielding.\r\n\r\nMany attempts have been made to draw the hemp fibre by machinery,\r\nbut in spite of all strenuous efforts, no one has hitherto succeeded\r\nin introducing into the hemp districts a satisfactory mechanical\r\napparatus. If the entire length of fibre in a strip of bast could\r\nbear the strain of full tension, instead of having to wind it\r\naround a cylinder (which would take the place of the operator's\r\nhand and stick under the present system), then a machine could be\r\ncontrived to accomplish the work. Machines with cylinders to reduce\r\nthe tension have been constructed, the result being admirable so\r\nfar as the extraction of the fibre is concerned, but the cylinder\r\nupon which the fibre coiled, as it came from under the knife, always\r\ndiscoloured the material. A trial was made with a glass cylinder,\r\nbut the same inconvenience was experienced. On another occasion the\r\ncylinder was dispensed with, and a reciprocating-motion clutch drew\r\nthe bast, running to and fro the whole length of the fibre frame,\r\nthe fibre being gripped by a pair of steel parallel bars on its\r\npassage in one or two places, as might be necessary, to lessen the\r\ntension. These steel bars, however, always left a transversal black\r\nline on the filament, and diminished its marketable value. What is\r\ndesired is a machine which could be worked by one man and turn out\r\nat least as much clean fibre as the old apparatus could with two\r\nmen. Also that the whole appliance should be portable by one man.\r\n\r\nIn 1886 the most perfect mechanical contrivance hitherto brought out\r\nwas tried in Manila by its Spanish inventor, Don Abelardo Cuesta;\r\nit worked to the satisfaction of those who saw it, but the saving\r\nof manual labour was so inconsiderable that the greater bulk of hemp\r\nshipped is still extracted by the primitive process.\r\n\r\nIn September, 1905, Fray Mateo Atienza, of the Franciscan Order,\r\nexhibited in Manila a hemp-fibre-drawing machine of his own invention,\r\nthe practical worth of which has yet to be ascertained. It is alleged\r\nthat this machine, manipulated by one man, can, in a given time, turn\r\nout 104 per cent. more clean fibre than the old-fashioned apparatus\r\nworked by two men.\r\n\r\n_Musa textilis_ has been planted in British India as an experiment,\r\nwith unsatisfactory result, evidently owing to a want of knowledge\r\nof the essential conditions of the fibre-extraction. One report\r\n[134] says--\r\n\r\n\r\n    \"The first trial at extracting the fibre failed on account of our\r\n    having no proper machine to _bruise_ the stems. We extemporized\r\n    a two-roller mill; but as it had no cog-gearing to cause both\r\n    rollers to turn together, the only one on which the handle or\r\n    crank was fixed turned, with, the result of grinding the stems\r\n    to pulp instead of simply _bruising_ them.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the Philippines one is careful _not_ to bruise the stems, as this\r\nwould weaken the fibre and discolour it.\r\n\r\nAnother statement from British India shows that Manila hemp requires\r\na very special treatment. It runs thus:--\r\n\r\n\r\n    \"The mode of extraction was the same as practised in the locality\r\n    with _Ambadi_ (brown hemp) and _sunn_ hemp, with the exception that\r\n    the stems were, in the first place, passed through a sugar-cane\r\n    mill which got rid of sap averaging 50 per cent. of the whole. The\r\n    stems were next rotted in water for 10 to 12 days, and afterwards\r\n    washed by hand and sun-dried. The out-turn of fibre was 1 3/4\r\n    lbs. per 100 lbs. of fresh stem, a percentage considerably higher\r\n    than the average shown in the Saidapet experiments; it was however\r\n    of bad colour and defective in strength.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nIf treated in the same manner in the Philippines, a similar bad result\r\nwould ensue; the pressure of mill rollers would discolour the fibre,\r\nand the soaking with 48 per cent. of pulp, before being sun-dried,\r\nwould weaken it.\r\n\r\nDr. Ure, in his \"Dictionary of Arts, Manufactures and Mines,\" p. 1,\r\nthus describes Manila Hemp:--\r\n\r\n\r\n    \"A species of fibre obtained in the Philippine Islands in\r\n    abundance. Some authorities refer these fibres to the palm-tree\r\n    known as the _Abaca_ or _Anisa textilis_. There seem indeed to be\r\n    several well-known varieties of fibre included under this name,\r\n    some so fine that they are used in the most delicate and costly\r\n    textures, mixed with fibres of the pine-apple, forming _pina_\r\n    muslins and textures equal to the best muslins of Bengal. [135]\r\n\r\n    \"Of the coarser fibres, mats, cordage and sail-cloth are\r\n    made. M. Duchesne states that the well-known fibrous manufactures\r\n    of Manila have led to the manufacture of the fibres themselves,\r\n    at Paris, into many articles of furniture and dress. Their\r\n    brilliancy and strength give remarkable fitness for bonnets,\r\n    tapestry, carpets, network, hammocks, etc. The only manufactured\r\n    articles exported from the Philippine Islands, enumerated by\r\n    Thomas de Comyn, Madrid, 1820 (translated by Walton), besides a\r\n    few tanned buffalo-hides and skins, are 8,000 to 12,000 pieces\r\n    of light sail-cloth and 200,000 lbs. of assorted _Abaca_ cordage.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nManila-hemp rope is very durable; it is equally applicable to\r\ncables and to ships' standing and running rigging, but wanting in\r\nflexibility. [136]\r\n\r\nHemp-growing, with ample capital, appears to be the most lucrative\r\nand least troublesome of all agricultural enterprises in staple\r\nexport produce in the Colony, whilst it is quite independent of the\r\nseasons. The plant is neither affected by disease nor do insects\r\nattack it, and the only ordinary risks appear to be hurricanes,\r\ndrought, insufficient weeding, and the ravages of the wild boar.\r\n\r\nPlanted in virgin soil, each shoot occupies, at first, a space of\r\n20 English square feet. In the course of time, this regularity of\r\ndistribution disappears as the original plant is felled and the\r\nsuckers come up anywhere, spontaneously, from its root. The plant\r\nrequires three years to arrive at cutting maturity, or four years if\r\nraised from the seed; most planters, however, transplant the six-month\r\nsuckers, instead of the seed, when forming a new plantation. The stem\r\nshould be cut for fibre-drawing at the flowering maturity; in no case\r\nshould it be allowed to bear fruit, as the fibre is thereby weakened,\r\nand there is sometimes even a waste of material in the drawing,\r\nas the accumulation of fibre with the sap at the knife is greater.\r\n\r\nThe average weight of dry fibre extracted from one plant equals\r\n10 ounces, or say 2 per cent, of the total weight of the stem and\r\npetioles; but as in practice there is a certain loss of petioles,\r\nby cutting out of maturity, whilst others are allowed to rot through\r\nnegligence, the average output from a carefully-managed estate does\r\nnot exceed 3-60 cwt. per acre, or say 4 piculs per caban of land.\r\n\r\nThe length of the _bast_, ready for manipulation at the knife,\r\naverages in Albay 6 feet 6 inches.\r\n\r\nThe weight of moisture in the wet fibre, immediately it is drawn\r\nfrom the bast, averages 56 per cent. To sun-dry the fibre thoroughly,\r\nan exposure of five hours is necessary.\r\n\r\nThe first petioles forming the outer covering, and the slender central\r\nstem itself around which they cluster, are thrown away. Due to the\r\ninefficient method of fibre-drawing, or rather the want of mechanical\r\nappliances to effect the same, the waste of fibre probably amounts\r\nto as much as 30 per cent. of the whole contained in the bast.\r\n\r\nIn sugar-cane planting, the poorer the soil is the wider the cane is\r\nplanted, whilst the hemp-plant is set out at greater space on virgin\r\nland than on old, worked land, the reason being that the hemp-plant\r\nin rich soil throws out a great number of shoots from the same root,\r\nwhich require nourishment and serve for replanting. If space were\r\nnot left for their development, the main stem would flower before\r\nit had reached its full height and circumference, whereas sugar-cane\r\nis purposely choked in virgin soil to check its running too high and\r\ndispersing the saccharine matter whilst becoming ligneous.\r\n\r\nA great advantage to the colonist, in starting hemp-growing in virgin\r\nforest-land, consists in the clearance requiring to be only partial,\r\nwhilst newly opened up land is preferable, as on it the young plants\r\nwill sometimes throw up as many as thirty suckers. The largest\r\nforest-trees are intentionally left to shade the plants and young\r\nshoots, so that only light rooting is imperatively necessary. In\r\ncane-planting, quite the reverse is the case, ploughing and sunshine\r\nbeing needful.\r\n\r\nThe great drawback to the beginner with limited capital is the\r\nimpossibility of recouping himself for his labour and recovering\r\nprofit on outlay before three years at least. After that period the\r\nrisk is small, drought being the chief calamity to be feared. The\r\nplants being set out on high land are extremely seldom inundated, and\r\na conflagration could not spread far amongst green leaves and sappy\r\npetioles. There is no special cropping season as there is in the case\r\nof sugar-cane, which, if neglected, brings a total loss of crop; the\r\nplants naturally do not all mature at precisely the same time, and the\r\nfibre-extraction can be performed with little precipitation, and more\r\nor less all the year round, although the dry season is preferable for\r\nthe sun-bleaching. If, at times, the stage of maturity be overlooked,\r\nit only represents a percentage of loss, whilst a whole plantation\r\nof ripe sugar-cane must all be cut with the least possible delay. No\r\nploughing is necessary, although the plant thrives better when weeding\r\nis carefully attended to; no costly machinery has to be purchased\r\nand either left to the mercy of inexperienced hands or placed under\r\nthe care of highly-paid Europeans, whilst there are few agricultural\r\nimplements and no live-stock to be maintained for field labour.\r\n\r\nThe hemp-fibre, when dry, runs a greater risk of fire than sugar,\r\nbut upon the whole, the comparative advantages of hemp cultivation\r\nover sugar-cane planting appear to be very great.\r\n\r\nHemp-fibre is classified by the large provincial dealers and Manila\r\nfirms as of first, second, and third qualities. The dealers, or\r\n_acopiadores_, in treating with the small native collectors, or\r\ntheir own workpeople, take delivery of hemp under two classes only,\r\nviz.:--first quality (_corriente_) and second quality (_colorada_),\r\nthe former being the whiter, with a beautiful silky gloss.\r\n\r\nThe difficulties with which the European hemp-cultivator has to\r\ncontend all centre to the same origin--the indolence of the native;\r\nhence there is a continual struggle between capitalist and labourer\r\nin the endeavour to counterbalance the native's inconstancy and\r\nantipathy to systematic work. Left to himself, the native cuts the\r\nplant at any period of its maturity. When he is hard pressed for a\r\npeso or two he strips a few petioles, leaving them for days exposed\r\nto the rain and atmosphere to soften and render easier the drawing\r\nof the fibre, in which putrefaction has commenced. The result is\r\nprejudicial to the dealer and the plantation owner, because the\r\nfibre discolours. Then he passes the bast under a _toothed_ knife,\r\nwhich is easy to work, and goes down to the village with his bundle of\r\ndiscoloured coarse fibre with a certain amount of dried sap on it to\r\nincrease the weight. He chooses night-time for the delivery, so that\r\nthe _acopiador_ may be deceived in the colour upon which depends the\r\nselection of quality, and in order that the fibre, absorbing the dew,\r\nmay weigh heavier. These are the tricks of the trade well known to\r\nthe native. The large dealers and plantation owners use every effort\r\nto enforce the use of knives without teeth, so that the fibre may be\r\nfine, perfectly clean and white, to rate as first-class; the native\r\nopposes this on the ground that he loses in weight, whilst he is too\r\ndull to appreciate his gain in higher value. For instance, presuming\r\nthe first quality to be quoted in Manila at a certain figure per picul\r\nand the third quality at two pesos less, even though the first-class\r\nbasis price remained firm, the third-class price would fall as the\r\npercentage of third-class quality in the supplies went on increasing.\r\n\r\nHere and there are to be found hemp-plants which give a whiter fibre\r\nthan others, whilst some assert that there are three or four kinds of\r\nhemp-plant; but in general all will yield commercial first-class hemp\r\n(_Abaca corriente_), and if the native could be coerced to cut the\r\nplant at maturity--draw the fibre under a toothless knife during the\r\nsame day of stripping the petioles--lodge the fibre as drawn on a clean\r\nplace, and sun-dry it on the first opportunity, then (the proprietors\r\nand dealers positively assert) the output of third-quality need not\r\nexceed 5 to 6 per cent. of the whole produced. In short, the question\r\nof quality in _Abaca_ has vastly less relation to the species of the\r\nplant than to the care taken in its extraction and manipulation.\r\n\r\nThe Chinese very actively collect parcels of hemp from the smallest\r\nclass of native owners, but they also enter into contracts which\r\nbring discredit to the reputation of a province as a hemp-producing\r\ndistrict. For a small sum in cash a Chinaman acquires from a native\r\nthe right to work his plantation during a short period. Having no\r\nproprietary interest at stake, and looking only to his immediate\r\ngain, he indiscriminately strips plants, regardless of maturity,\r\nand the property reverts to the small owner in a sorely dilapidated\r\ncondition. The market result is that, although the fibre drawn may be\r\nwhite, it is weak, therefore dealings with the Chinese require special\r\nscrutiny. Under the native system each labourer on an \"estate\" (called\r\nin Albay Province _late_) is remunerated by receiving one-half of all\r\nthe fibre he draws; the other half belongs to the _late_ owner. The\r\nshare corresponding to the labourer is almost invariably delivered\r\nat the same time to the employer, who purchases it at the current\r\nlocal value--often at much less.\r\n\r\nIn sugar-planting, as no sugar can be hoped for until the fixed\r\ngrinding-season of the year, planters have to advance to their\r\nworkpeople during the whole twelve months in Luzon, under the\r\n_aparcero_ system. If, after so advancing during six or eight months,\r\nhe loses half or more of his crop by natural causes, he stands a poor\r\nchance of recovering his advances of that year. There is no such risk\r\nin the case of hemp; when a man wants money he can work for it, and\r\nbring in his bundle of fibre and receive his half-share value. The\r\nfew foreigners engaged in hemp-planting usually employ wage labour.\r\n\r\nIn Manila the export-houses estimate the prices of second and third\r\nqualities by a rebate from first-class quality price. These rates\r\nnecessarily fluctuate. When the deliveries of second and third\r\nqualities go on increasing in their proportion to the quantity of\r\nfirst-class sent to the market, the rebate for lower qualities on\r\nthe basis price (first-class) is consequently augmented. If the total\r\nsupplies to Manila began to show an extraordinarily large proportionate\r\nincrease of lower qualities, these differences of prices would be made\r\nwider, and in this manner indirect pressure is brought to bear upon the\r\nprovincial shippers to send as much first-class quality as possible.\r\n\r\nThe labour of young plant-setting in Albay Province in Spanish times\r\nwas calculated at 3 pesos per 1,000 plants; the cost of shoots 2 feet\r\nhigh, for planting out, was from 50 cents to one peso per 100. However,\r\nas proprietors were frequently cheated by natives who, having agreed\r\nto plant out the land, did not dig holes sufficiently deep, or set\r\nplants without roots, it became customary in Luzon to pay 10 pesos\r\nper 100 live plants, to be counted at the time of full growth, or\r\nsay in three years, in lieu of paying for shoots and labour at the\r\nprices stated above. The contractor, of course, lived on the estate.\r\n\r\nIn virgin soil, 2,500 plants would be set in one _pisoson_ of land\r\n(_vide_ Albay land measure), or say 720 to each acre.\r\n\r\nA hemp-press employing 60 men and boys should turn out 230 bales per\r\nday. Freight by mail steamer to Manila in the year 1890 from Albay\r\nports beyond the San Bernardino Straits, was 50 cents per bale;\r\nfrom ports west of the Straits, 37 1/2 cents per bale.\r\n\r\nIn the extraction of the fibre the natives work in couples; one man\r\nstrips the bast, whilst his companion draws it under the knife. A fair\r\nweek's work for a couple, including selection of the mature plants\r\nand felling, would be about 300 lbs. However, the labourer is not\r\nable to give his entire attention to fibre-drawing, for occasionally\r\na day has to be spent in weeding and brushwood clearance, but his\r\nhalf-share interest covers this duty.\r\n\r\nThe finest quality of hemp is produced in the Islands of Leyte and\r\nMarinduque, and in the Province of Sorsogon, especially Gubat, in\r\nLuzon Island.\r\n\r\nPrevious to the year 1825, the quantity of hemp produced in these\r\nIslands was insignificant; in 1840 it is said to have exceeded 8,500\r\ntons. The _average annual_ shipment of hemp during the 20 years\r\npreceding the American occupation, i.e., 1879-98, was 72,815 tons,\r\nproduced (annual average over that period) approximately as follows,\r\nviz.:--in Albay and Sorsogon, 32,000 tons; in Leyte, 16,000 tons; in\r\nSamar, 9,000 tons; in Camarines, 4,500 tons; in Mindanao, 4,000 tons;\r\nin Cebu, 2,500 tons; in all the other districts together, 4,815 tons.\r\n\r\nAlbay Province is still the leading hemp district in the Islands. A\r\nsmall quantity of low-quality hemp is produced in Capis Province\r\n(Panay Is.); collections are also made along the south-east coast of\r\nNegros Island from Dumaguete northwards and in the district of Mauban\r\n[137] on the Pacific coast of Tayabas Province (Luzon Is). For figures\r\nof Hemp Shipments, _vide_ Chap. xxxi., \"Trade Statistics.\"\r\n\r\nThe highest Manila quotation for first-quality hemp (_corriente_)\r\nduring the years 1882 to 1896 inclusive was P17.21 1/2 per picul,\r\nand the lowest in the same period P6.00 per picul (16 piculs = 1 ton;\r\n2 piculs = 1 bale), whilst specially selected lots from Sorsogon and\r\nMarinduque fetched a certain advance on these figures.\r\n\r\n\r\n               _Albay Province (local) Land Measure_\r\n\r\n      1     Topon   = 16 square Brazas = 53.776 English square yards.\r\n    312 1/2 Topones = 1 Pisoson = 5,000 square Brazas.\r\n    312 1/2 Topones = 1/2 of Quinon = 2 1/2 Cabanes = 3.472 acres.\r\n\r\n\r\nDuring the decade prior to the commercial depression of 1884, enormous\r\nsums of money were lent by foreign firms and wealthy hemp-staplers to\r\nthe small producers against deliveries to be effected. But experience\r\nproved that lending to native producers was a bad business, for,\r\non delivery of the produce, they expected to be again paid the full\r\nvalue and pass over the sums long due. Hence, capital which might\r\nhave been employed to the mutual advantage of all concerned, was\r\npartially withheld, and the natives complained then, as they do now,\r\nthat there is no money.\r\n\r\nFortunately for the Philippines, the fibre known as Manila hemp is a\r\nspeciality of the Colony, and the prospect of over-production, almost\r\nannihilating profits to producers--as in the sugar colonies--is\r\nat present remote, although the competition with other fibre is\r\nsevere. The chief fibre-producing countries, besides this colony,\r\nare New Zealand, Mauritius, East Indies, Italy, Russia, North America\r\n(sisal) and Mexico (henequen).\r\n\r\nIn 1881 the _Abaca_ plants presented to the Saigon Botanical Gardens\r\nwere flourishing during the management of Mons. Coroy, but happily for\r\nthis Colony the experiment, which was to precede the introduction\r\nof \"Manila Hemp\" into French Cochin China, was abandoned, the\r\nplants having been removed by that gentleman's successor. In 1890\r\n\"Manila Hemp\" was cultivated in British North Borneo by the Labuk\r\nPlanting Company, Limited, and the fibre raised on their estates was\r\nsatisfactorily reported on by the Rope Works in Hong-Kong.\r\n\r\nIn view of the present scarcity of live-stock, hemp, which needs\r\nno buffalo tillage, would seem to be the most hopeful crop of\r\nthe future. It will probably advance as fast as sugar cultivation\r\nis receding, and command a good remunerative price. Moreover, as\r\nalready explained, not being distinctly a season crop as sugar is,\r\nnor requiring expensive machinery to produce it, its cultivation is\r\nthe most recommendable to American colonists.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_Coffee_ _(Coffea arabica)_ planting was commenced in the Colony\r\nearly in the last century. Up to 1889 plantation-owners in the\r\nProvince of Batangas assured me that the trees possessed by their\r\ngrandfathers were still flourishing, whilst it is well known\r\nthat in many coffee-producing colonies the tree bears profitably\r\nonly up to the twenty-fifth year, and at the thirtieth year it is\r\nquite exhausted. Unless something be done to revive this branch of\r\nagriculture it seems as if coffee would soon cease to be an article\r\nof export from these Islands. In the year 1891 the crops in Luzon\r\nbegan to fall off very considerably, in a small measure due to the\r\ntrees having lost their vigour, but chiefly owing to the ravages\r\nof a worm in the stems. In 1892-93 the best and oldest-established\r\nplantations were almost annihilated. Nothing could be done to stop\r\nthe scourge, and several of the wealthiest coffee-owners around Lipa,\r\npersonally known to me, ploughed up their land and started sugar-cane\r\ngrowing in place of coffee. In 1883 7,451 tons of coffee were shipped,\r\nwhilst in 1903 the total export did not reach four tons.\r\n\r\nThe best Philippine Coffee comes from the Provinces of Batangas,\r\nLa Laguna and Cavite (Luzon Is.), and includes a large proportion of\r\n_caracolillo_, which is the nearest shape to the Mocha bean and the\r\nmost esteemed. The temperate mountain regions of Benguet, Bontoc,\r\nand Lepanto (N.W. Luzon) also yield good coffee.\r\n\r\nThe most inferior Philippine coffee is produced in Mindanao Island,\r\nand is sent up to Manila sometimes containing a quantity of rotten\r\nbeans. It consequently always fetches a lower price than Manila (i.e.,\r\nLuzon) coffee, which is highly prized in the market.\r\n\r\n\r\nMANILA QUOTATIONS FOR THE TWO QUALITIES\r\n\r\nAverage Prices throughout the Years\r\n\r\n\r\nPer Picul of 133 1/3 Eng. lbs.\r\n\r\nManila (Luzon) Coffee\r\n        1882   1883   1884   1885   1886   1887   1888   1890   1891\r\n        P.cts.

In 1896,\r\nfor instance, the market price ran up to P35 per picul, whilst some\r\nsmall parcels exchanged hands at a figure so capriciously high that\r\nit cannot be taken as a quotation. For figures of Coffee Shipments,\r\n_vide_ Chap, xxxi., \"Trade Statistics.\"\r\n\r\nI investigated the system of coffee-growing and trading in all the\r\nLuzon districts, and found it impossible to draw up a correct general\r\nestimate showing the nett cost laid down in Manila market. The manner\r\nof acquiring the produce and the conditions of purchase varied so\r\ngreatly, and were subject to so many peculiar local circumstances,\r\nthat only an approximate computation could be arrived at.\r\n\r\nSome of the provincial collectors had plantations of their own; others\r\nhad not, whilst none of them depended entirely upon the produce of\r\ntheir own trees for fulfilling the contracts in the capital.\r\n\r\nCoffee was a much more fluctuating concern than hemp, as the\r\npurchase-rate (although perhaps low) was determined out of season\r\nseveral months before it was seen how the market would stand for the\r\nsale of that coffee; in hemp transactions (there being practically no\r\nseason for hemp) the purchase-money need only be paid on delivery of\r\nthe produce by the labourer at rates proportionate to Manila prices,\r\nunless the dealer be simply a speculator, in which case, having\r\ncontracted in Manila to deliver at a price, he must advance to secure\r\ndeliveries to fulfil his contract. Therefore, in coffee, a provincial\r\ncollector might lose something on the total year's transactions or he\r\nmight make an enormous profit, if he worked with his own capital. If\r\nhe borrowed the capital from Manila dealers--middlemen--as was often\r\nthe case, then he might make a fortune for his Manila friends, or he\r\nmight lose another year's interest on the borrowed funds.\r\n\r\nIn Cavite Province districts there was another way of negotiating\r\ncoffee speculations. The dealer with capital advanced at, say, 6 or 7\r\npesos per picul \"on joint account up to Manila.\" The planter then bound\r\nhimself to deliver so many piculs of coffee of the next gathering,\r\nand the difference between the advance rate and the sale price in\r\nManila was shared between the two, after the capitalist had deducted\r\nthe charges for transport, packing, commission in Manila, etc. All\r\nthe risk was, of course, on the part of the capitalist, for if the\r\ncrop failed the small planter had no means of refunding the advance.\r\n\r\nOn a carefully-managed plantation, a caban of land (8,000 square\r\nSpanish yards) was calculated to yield 10.40 piculs (= 12 1/2\r\ncwt.) of clean coffee, or, say, 9 cwt. per acre. The selling value\r\nof a plantation, in full growth, was about P250 per caban, or, say,\r\nP180 per acre. After 1896 this land value was merely nominal.\r\n\r\nThe trees begin to give marketable coffee in the fourth year of\r\ngrowth, and flourish best in hilly districts and on highlands, where\r\nthe roots can be kept dry, and where the average temperature does\r\nnot exceed 70 deg. Fahr. _Caracolillo_ is found in greater quantities on\r\nthe highest declivities facing east, where the morning sun evaporates\r\nthe superfluous moisture of the previous night's dew.\r\n\r\nIn the Province of Cavite there appeared to be very little system in\r\nthe culture of the coffee-tree. Little care was taken in the selection\r\nof shading-trees, and pruning was much neglected. Nevertheless,\r\nvery fine coffee was brought from the neighbourhood of Indan, Silan,\r\nAlfonso, and Amadeo. The Batangas bean had the best reputation in\r\nManila; hence the Indan product was sometimes brought to that market\r\nand sold as Batangas coffee.\r\n\r\nIn Batangas the coffee-plant is usually shaded by a tree called\r\n_Madrecacao_ (_Gliricidia maculata_)--Tagalog, _Galedupa pungam_. On\r\nstarting a plantation this tree is placed in rows, each trunk occupying\r\none Spanish yard, and when it has attained two or three feet in height\r\nthe coffee-shoot is planted at each angle. Between the third and\r\neighth years of growth every alternate shading-tree and coffee-plant\r\nis removed, as more space for development becomes necessary. The\r\ncoffee-plants are pruned from time to time, and on no account should\r\nthe branches be allowed to hang over and meet. Around the wealthy town\r\nof Lipa some of the many coffee-estates were extremely well kept up,\r\nwith avenues crossing the plantations in different directions.\r\n\r\nAt the end of eight years, more or less, according to how the\r\nquality of soil and the situation have influenced the development,\r\nthere would remain, say, about 2,400 plants in each caban of land,\r\nor 1,728 plants per acre. Comparing this with the yield per acre,\r\neach tree would therefore give 9.33 ounces of marketable coffee,\r\nwhilst in Peru, where the coffee-tree is planted at an elevation of\r\n5,000 to 6,000 feet above sea-level, each tree is said to yield one\r\npound weight of beans.\r\n\r\nIn the Philippines the fresh ripe berries, when thoroughly sun-dried,\r\nlose an average weight of 52 per cent. moisture.\r\n\r\nThe sun-dried berries ready for pounding (husking) give an average\r\nof 33.70 of their weight in marketable coffee-beans.\r\n\r\nIt takes _eight_ cabanes measure (_vide_ p. 276) of fresh-picked ripe\r\nberries to turn out _one_ picul weight of clean beans.\r\n\r\nOwing to the fact that one year in every five gives a short crop,\r\ndue either to the nature of the plant or to climatic variations,\r\nit pays better to collect coffee from the very small growers rather\r\nthan sink capital in large estates on the _aparcero_ system (q.v.).\r\n\r\nThe coffee-plant imperatively requires shade and moisture, and\r\nover-pruning is prejudicial. If allowed to run to its natural height\r\nit would grow up to 15 to 25 feet high, but it is usually kept\r\nat 7 to 10 feet. The leaves are evergreen, very shining, oblong,\r\nleathery, and much resemble those of the common laurel. The flowers\r\nare small, and cluster in the axils of the leaves. They are somewhat\r\nsimilar to the Spanish jasmine, and being snow-white, the effect\r\nof a coffee plantation in bloom is delightful, whilst the odour is\r\nfragrant. The fruit, when ripe, is of a dark scarlet colour, and the\r\nordinary coffee-berry contains two semi-elliptic seeds of a horny or\r\ncartilaginous nature glued together and enveloped in a coriaceous\r\nmembrane; when this is removed each seed is found covered with a\r\nsilver-grey pellicle.\r\n\r\nThe _Caracolillo_ coffee-berry contains only one seed, with a furrow\r\nin the direction of the long axis, which gives it the appearance of\r\nbeing a geminous seed with an inclination to open out on one side.\r\n\r\nIn Arabia Felix, where coffee was first planted in the 15th century,\r\nand its cultivation is still extensive, the collection of the fruit\r\nis effected by spreading cloths under the trees, from which, on being\r\nviolently shaken, the ripe berries fall, and are then placed upon\r\nmats to dry, after which the beans are pressed under a heavy roller.\r\n\r\nIn the Philippines, women and children--sometimes men--go into the\r\nplantations with baskets and pick the berries. The fruit is then\r\nheaped, and, in a few days, washed, so that a great portion of the\r\npulp is got rid of. Then the berries are dried and pounded in a mortar\r\nto separate the inner membrane and pellicle; these are winnowed from\r\nthe clean bean, which constitutes the coffee of commerce and is sent\r\nin bags to Manila for sale.\r\n\r\nThe Philippine plantations give only one crop yearly, whilst in the\r\nWest Indies beans of unequal ripeness are to be found during eight\r\nmonths of the twelve, and in Brazil there are three annual gatherings.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe seed of the _Tobacco-plant_ (_Nicotiana tabacum_) was among the\r\nmany novelties introduced into the Philippines from Mexico by Spanish\r\nmissionaries, soon after the possession of the Colony by the Spaniards\r\nwas an accomplished fact. From this Colony it is said to have been\r\ntaken in the 16th or 17th century into the south of China, where\r\nits use was so much abused that the sale of this so-called noxious\r\narticle was, for a long time, prohibited under penalty of death.\r\n\r\nDuring the first two centuries of Spanish dominion but little direct\r\nattention was paid to the tobacco question by the Government, who only\r\nnominally held, but did not assert, the exclusive right of traffic in\r\nthis article. At length, in the year 1781, during the Gov.-Generalship\r\nof Jose Basco y Vargas (a naval officer), the cultivation and sale\r\nof tobacco was formally decreed a State monopoly, which lasted up\r\nto the end of the year 1882. In the meantime, it became an important\r\nitem of public revenue. In 1882 the profits of the Tobacco Monopoly\r\namounted to half the Colony's Budget expenditure.\r\n\r\nA few years before that date a foreign company offered to guarantee the\r\nBudget (then about P15,000,000), in exchange for the Tobacco Monopoly,\r\nbut the proposal was not entertained, although in the same year the\r\nTreasury deficit amounted to P2,000,000.\r\n\r\nBy Royal Decree of July 1, 1844, a contract was entered into with\r\nthe firm of O'Shea & Co., renting to them the Monopoly, but it was\r\nsuddenly rescinded. The annual profits from tobacco to the Government\r\nat that date were about P2,500,000.\r\n\r\n\r\n                    GOVERNMENT PROFIT\r\n\r\n                    1840        P2,123,505\r\n                    1845         2,570,679\r\n                    1850         3,036,611\r\n                    1855         3,721,168\r\n                    1859         4,932,463\r\n                    1860    over 5,000,000\r\n                    1869         5,230,581\r\n\r\n\r\nA bale of tobacco contains 4,000 leaves in 40 bundles (_manos_),\r\nof 100 leaves each.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe classification of the deliveries depended on the districts where\r\nthe crop was raised and the length of the leaf.\r\n\r\nThe tobacco trade being also a Government concern in Spain, this\r\nColony was required to supply the Peninsula State Factories with\r\n90,000 quintals (of 100 Span, lbs.) of tobacco-leaf per annum.\r\n\r\nGovernment Monopoly was in force in Luzon Island only. The tobacco\r\ndistricts of that island were Cagayan Valley (which comprises La\r\nIsabela), La Union, El Abra, Ilocos Sur y Norte and Nueva Ecija. In no\r\nother part of Luzon was tobacco-planting allowed, except for a short\r\nperiod on the Caraballo range, inhabited by undomesticated mountain\r\ntribes, upon whom prohibition would have been difficult to enforce. In\r\n1842 the Igorrotes were allowed to plant, and, in the year 1853,\r\nthe Government collection from this source amounted to 25,000 bales\r\nof excellent quality. The total population of these districts was,\r\nin 1882 (the last year of Monopoly), about 785,000.\r\n\r\nThe Visayas Islands were never under the Monopoly system. The natives\r\nthere were free to raise tobacco or other crops on their land. It was\r\nnot until 1840 that tobacco-planting attracted general attention in\r\nVisayas. Government factories or collecting-centres were established\r\nthere for classifying and storing such tobacco as the Visayos cared\r\nto bring in for sale to the State, but they were at liberty to sell\r\ntheir produce privately or in the public markets. They also disposed\r\nof large quantities by contraband to the Luzon Island Provinces. [138]\r\n\r\nAntique Province never yielded more tobacco than could be consumed\r\nlocally. In 1841 the Antique tobacco crop was valued at P80,000. But,\r\nin the hope of obtaining higher prices, the enthusiastic Provincial\r\nGovernor, Manuel Iturriaga, encouraged the growers, in 1843, to\r\nsend a trial parcel to the Government collectors; it was, however,\r\nunclassed and rejected.\r\n\r\nMindoro, Lucban, and Marinduque Islands produced tobacco about sixty\r\nyears ago, and in 1846 the Government established a collecting-centre\r\nin Mindoro; but the abuses and cruelty of the officials towards the\r\nnatives, to force them to bring in their crops, almost extinguished\r\nthis class of husbandry.\r\n\r\nDuring the period of Monopoly in the Luzon districts, the\r\nproduction was very carefully regulated by the Home Government, by\r\nenactments revised from time to time, called \"General Instructions\r\nfor the Direction, Administration and Control of the Government\r\nMonopolies.\" [139] Compulsory labour was authorized, and those natives\r\nin the northern provinces of Luzon Island who wished to till the land\r\n(the property of the State)--for title-deeds were almost unknown and\r\nnever applied for by the natives--were compelled to give preference to\r\ntobacco. In fact, no other crops were allowed to be raised. Moreover,\r\nthey were not permitted peacefully to indulge their indolent nature--to\r\nscrape up the earth and plant when and where they liked for a mere\r\nsubsistence. Each family was coerced into contracting with the\r\nGovernment to raise 4,000 plants per annum, subject to a fine in the\r\nevent of failure. The planter had to deliver into the State stores\r\nall the tobacco of his crop--not a single leaf could he reserve for\r\nhis private consumption.\r\n\r\nLands left uncultivated could be appropriated by the Government, who\r\nput their own nominees to work them, and he who had come to consider\r\nhimself owner, by mere undisturbed possession, lost the usufruct and\r\nall other rights for three years. His right to the land, in fact,\r\nwas not freehold, but tenure by villein socage.\r\n\r\nEmigrants were sent north from the west coast Provinces of North and\r\nSouth Ilocos. The first time I went up to Cagayan about 200 emigrant\r\nfamilies were taken on board our vessel at North Ilocos, _en route_\r\nfor the tobacco districts, and appeared to be as happy as other\r\nnatives in general. They were well supplied with food and clothing,\r\nand comfortably lodged on their arrival at the Port of Aparri.\r\n\r\nIn the Government Regulations referred to, the old law of Charles\r\nIII., which enacted that a native could not be responsible at law\r\nfor a debt exceeding P5, was revived, and those emigrants who had\r\ndebts were only required to liquidate them out of their earnings in\r\nthe tobacco district up to that legal maximum value.\r\n\r\nAs soon as the native growers were settled on their lands their\r\ncondition was by no means an enviable one. A Nueva Ecija landowner\r\nand tobacco-grower, in a letter to _El Liberal_ (Madrid) in 1880,\r\ndepicts the situation in the following terms:--The planter, he\r\nsays, was only allowed to smoke tobacco of his own crop inside the\r\naerating-sheds which were usually erected on the fields under tilth. If\r\nhe happened to be caught by a carabineer only a few steps outside the\r\nshed with a cigar in his mouth he was fined 2 pesos--if a cigarette,\r\n50 cents--and adding to these sums the costs of the conviction,\r\na cigar of his own crop came to cost him P7.37 1/2, and a cigarette\r\nP1.87 1/2. The fines in Nueva Ecija amounted to an annual average of\r\nP7,000 on a population of 170,000. From sunrise to sunset the native\r\ngrower was subject to domiciliary search for concealed tobacco--his\r\ntrunks, furniture, and every nook and corner of his dwelling were\r\nransacked. He and all his family--wife and daughters--were personally\r\nexamined: and often an irate husband, father, or brother, goaded to\r\nindignation by the indecent humiliation of his kinswoman, would lay\r\nhands on his bowie-knife and bring matters to a bloody crisis with\r\nhis wanton persecutors... The leaves were carefully selected, and\r\nonly such as came under classification were paid for. The rejected\r\nbundles were not returned to the grower, but burnt--a despairing\r\nsacrifice to the toiler! The _Cabezas de Barangay_ (_vide_ p. 223)\r\nhad, under penalty of arrest and hard labour, to see that the families\r\nfulfilled their onerous contract. Corporal punishment, imprisonment,\r\nand amercement resulted; of frequent occurrence were those fearful\r\nscenes which culminated in riots such as those of Ilocos in 1807 and\r\n1814, when many Spaniards fell victims to the natives' resentment of\r\ntheir oppression.\r\n\r\nPalpable injustice, too, was imposed by the Government with respect\r\nto the payments. The Treasury paid loyally for many years, but as\r\ngeneration succeeded generation, and the native growers' families\r\ncame to feel themselves attached to the soil they cultivated, the\r\nTreasury, reposing on the security of this constancy, no longer\r\nkept to the compact. The officials failed to pay with punctuality\r\nto the growers the contracted value of the deliveries to the State\r\nstores. They required exactitude from the native--the Government set\r\nthe example of remissness. The consequence was appalling. Instead of\r\nmoney Treasury notes were given them, and speculators of the lowest\r\ntype used to scour the tobacco-growing districts to buy up this paper\r\nat an enormous discount. The misery of the natives was so distressing,\r\nthe distrust of the Government so radicate, and the want of means of\r\nexistence so urgent, that they were wont to yield their claims for an\r\ninsignificant relative specie value. The speculators held the bonds for\r\nrealization some day; the total amount due by the Government at one\r\ntime exceeded P1,500,000. Once the Treasury was so hard-pressed for\r\nfunds that the tobacco ready in Manila for shipment to Spain had to\r\nbe sold on the spot and the 90,000 quintals could not be sent--hence\r\npurchases of Philippine tobacco had to be made by tender in London\r\nfor the Spanish Government cigar factories.\r\n\r\nAt length, during the government of General Domingo Moriones (1877-80),\r\nit was resolved to listen to the overwhelming complaints from the\r\nNorth, and pay up to date in coin. But, to do this, Spain, always in\r\na state of chronic insolvency, had to resort to an abominable measure\r\nof disloyalty. The funds of the Deposit Bank (_Caja de Depositos_)\r\nwere arbitrarily appropriated, and the deposit-notes, bearing 8 per\r\ncent. interest per annum, held by private persons, most of whom were\r\nGovernment clerks, etc., were dishonoured at due date. This gave rise\r\nto great clamour on the part of those individuals whose term of service\r\nhad ceased (_cesantes_), and who, on their return to Spain, naturally\r\nwished to take their accumulated savings with them. The Gov.-General\r\nhad no other recourse open to him but to reinstate them in their old\r\npositions, on his own responsibility, pending the financial crisis\r\nand the receipt of instructions from the Government at Madrid.\r\n\r\nFor a long time the question of abolishing the Monopoly had\r\nbeen debated, and by Royal Order of May 20, 1879, a commission\r\nwas appointed to inquire into the convenience of farming out the\r\ntobacco traffic. The natives were firmly opposed to it; they dreaded\r\nthe prospect of the provinces being overrun by a band of licensed\r\npersecutors, and of the two evils they preferred State to private\r\nMonopoly. Warm discussions arose for and against it through the medium\r\nof the Manila newspapers. The \"Consejo de Filipinas,\" in Madrid,\r\nhad given a favourable report dated May 12, 1879, and published in\r\nthe _Gaceta de Madrid_ of July 13, 1879. The clergy defeated the\r\nproposal by the Corporations of Friars jointly presenting a Memorial\r\nagainst it--and it was thenceforth abandoned. The Tobacco Monopoly\r\nwas the largest source of public revenue, hence the doubt as to the\r\npolicy of free trade and the delay in granting it. There existed a\r\npossibility of the Treasury sustaining an immense and irretrievable\r\nloss, for a return to Monopoly, after free trade had been allowed,\r\ncould not for a moment be thought of. It was then a safe income to\r\nthe Government, and it was feared by many that the industry, by free\r\nlabour, would considerably fall off.\r\n\r\nAs already stated, the Government Monopoly ceased on December 31,\r\n1882, when the tobacco cultivation and trade were handed over to\r\nprivate enterprise. At that date there were five Government Cigar and\r\nCigarette Factories, viz.:--Malabon, Arroceros, Meisig, El Fortin,\r\nand Cavite, giving employment to about 20,000 operatives.\r\n\r\nUp to within a year of the abolition of Monopoly, a very good smokeable\r\ncigar could be purchased in the _estancos_ [140] from one half-penny\r\nand upwards, but as soon as the free trade project was definitely\r\ndecided upon, the Government factories, in order to work off their\r\nold stocks of inferior leaf, filled the _estancos_ with cigars of\r\nthe worst quality.\r\n\r\nThe Colonial Treasurer-General at the time of this reform entertained\r\nvery sanguine hopes respecting the rush which would be made for the\r\nGovernment brands, and the general public were led to believe that\r\na scarcity of manufactured tobacco would, for some months, at least,\r\nfollow the establishment of free trade in this article. With this idea\r\nin view, Government stocks sold at auction aroused competition and\r\nfetched unusually high prices at the close of 1882 and the first month\r\nof the following year, in some cases as much as 23/- per cwt. being\r\nrealized over the upset prices. However, the Treasurer-General was\r\ncarried too far in his expectations. He was unfortunately induced to\r\nhold a large amount of Government manufactured tobacco in anticipation\r\nof high offers, the result being an immense loss to the Treasury,\r\nas only a part was placed, with difficulty, at low prices, and the\r\nremainder shipped to Spain. In January, 1883, the stock of tobacco in\r\nGovernment hands amounted to about 100 tons of 1881 crop, besides the\r\nwhole crop of 1882. Little by little the upset prices had to be lowered\r\nto draw buyers. The tobacco shipped during the first six months of the\r\nyear 1883 was limited to that sold by auction out of the Government\r\nstocks, for the Government found themselves in a dilemma with their\r\nstores of this article, and the free export only commenced half a year\r\nafter free production was granted. On December 29, 1883, a Government\r\nsale by auction was announced at 50 per cent. reduction on their\r\nalready low prices, but the demand was still very meagre. Finally,\r\nin the course of 1884, the Government got rid of the bulk of their\r\nstock, the balance being shipped to the mother country. The colonial\r\nauthorities continued to pay the ancient tobacco-tribute to Spain,\r\nand the first contract, with this object, was made during that year\r\nwith a private company for the supply of about 2,750 tons.\r\n\r\nDuring the first year of Free Trade, cigar and cigarette factories were\r\nrapidly started in Manila and the provinces, but up to 1897 only some\r\neight or ten factories had improved the quality of the manufactured\r\narticle, whilst prices rose so considerably that the general public\r\nprobably lost by the reform. Cigars, like those sold in the _estancos_\r\nin 1881, could never again be got so good for the same price, but at\r\nhigher prices much better brands were offered.\r\n\r\nA small tax on the cigar and tobacco-leaf trade, officially announced\r\nin August, 1883, had the beneficial effect of causing the closure of\r\nsome of the very small manufactories, and reduced the probability of\r\na large over-supply of an almost worthless article.\r\n\r\nExport-houses continued to make large shipments of leaf-tobacco and\r\ncigars until the foreign markets were glutted with Philippine tobacco\r\nin 1883, and in the following years the export somewhat decreased. For\r\nfigures of Tobacco Leaf and Cigar Shipments, _vide_ Chap, xxxi.,\r\n\"Trade Statistics.\"\r\n\r\nAs to the relative quality of Philippine tobacco, there are very\r\ndivided opinions. Decidedly the best Manila cigars cannot compare\r\nwith those made from the famous leaf of the Vuelta de Abajo (Cuba),\r\nand in the European markets they have very justly failed to meet with\r\nthe same favourable reception as the Cuban cigars generally.\r\n\r\nDuring my first journey up the Cagayan River, I was told that some\r\nyears ago the Government made earnest efforts to improve the quality of\r\nthe plant by the introduction of seed from Cuba, but unfortunately it\r\nbecame mixed up with that usually planted in the Philippine provinces,\r\nand the object in view failed completely. On my renewed visit to the\r\ntobacco districts, immediately after the abolition of monopoly, the\r\nimportance of properly manipulating the green leaf did not appear to\r\nbe thoroughly appreciated. The exact degree of fermentation was not\r\nascertained with the skill and perseverance necessary to turn out a\r\nwell-prepared article. Some piles which I tested were over-heated\r\n(taking the Java system as my standard), whilst larger quantities\r\nhad been aerated so long in the shed, after cutting, that they had\r\nlost their finest aroma.\r\n\r\nThere are many risks in tobacco-leaf trading. The leaf, during its\r\ngrowth, is exposed to perforation by a worm which, if not brushed off\r\nevery morning, may spread over the whole field. Through the indolence\r\nof the native cultivator this misfortune happens so frequently that\r\nrarely does the Cagayan Valley tobacco contain (in the total crop of\r\nthe season) more than 10 per cent. of perfect, undamaged leaves. In\r\nthe aerating-sheds another kind of worm appears in the leaf; and,\r\nagain, after the leaves are baled or the cigars boxed, an insect\r\ndrills little holes through them--locally, it is said to be \"picado.\"\r\n\r\nOften in the dry season (the winter months) the tobacco-leaf,\r\nfor want of a little moisture, matures narrow, thick and gummy,\r\nand contains an excess of nicotine, in which case it can only be\r\nused after several years' storage. Too much rain entirely spoils\r\nthe leaf. Another obstacle to Philippine cigar manufacture is the\r\nincreasing universal demand for cigars with light-coloured wrappers,\r\nfor which hardly two per cent. of the Philippine leaf is suitable in\r\nworld competition, whilst the operative cannot handle with economy the\r\ndelicate light-coloured Sumatra wrapper. The difficulties of transport\r\nare so great that it costs more to bring the finest tobacco-leaf from\r\nthe field to the Manila factory than it would to send it from Manila\r\nto Europe in large parcels. The labour question is also an important\r\nconsideration, for it takes several years of daily practice for a\r\nFilipino to turn out a first-class marketable cigar; the most skilful\r\noperatives can earn up to P50 a month.\r\n\r\nThe best quality of Philippine tobacco is produced in the northern\r\nprovinces of Luzon Island, the choicest selections coming from Cagayan\r\nand La Isabela. The Provinces of Nueva Vizcaya, Ilocos Sur y Norte,\r\nLa Union, Nueva Ecija, and even Pampanga, yield tobacco.\r\n\r\nIn the Visayas, tobacco is cultivated in Panay Island and on the east\r\ncoast of Negros Island (district of Escalante) and Cebu Island--also to\r\na limited extent in Mindanao. The Visaya leaf generally is inferior\r\nin quality, particularly that of Yloilo Province, some of which,\r\nin fact, is such rubbish that it is difficult to understand how a\r\nprofit can be expected from its cultivation. The Escalante (Negros,\r\nE. coast) and the Barili (Cebu W. coast) tobacco seemed to me to be\r\nthe fullest flavoured and most agreeable leaf in all the Visayas.\r\n\r\nA tobacco plantation is about as pretty as a cabbage-field.\r\n\r\nIn 1883 a company, styled The General Philippine Tobacco Company\r\n(\"Compania General de Tabacos de Filipinas\"), formed in Spain and\r\nfinancially supported by French capitalists, was established in\r\nthis Colony with a capital of L3,000,000. It gave great impulse\r\nto the trade by soon starting with five factories and purchasing\r\nfour estates (\"San Antonio,\" \"Santa Isabel,\" \"San Luis,\" and \"La\r\nConcepcion\"), with buying-agents in every tobacco district. Up to\r\n1898 the baled tobacco-leaf trade was chiefly in the hands of this\r\ncompany. Little by little the company launched out into other branches\r\nof produce-purchasing, and lost considerable sums of money in the\r\nprovinces in its unsuccessful attempt to compete with the shrewd\r\nforeign merchants, but it is still a good going concern.\r\n\r\n\r\n    PRICES AND WEIGHTS OF SOME OF THE BEST CIGARS MANUFACTURED IN\r\n    MANILA PACKED IN BOXES READY FOR USE OR SHIPMENT.\r\n\r\n    Per Thousand.

There\r\nis no great demand for this grain, and it is generally cultivated\r\nrather as an article for consumption in the grower's household than\r\nfor trade. Planted in good land it gives about 200-fold, and two crops\r\nin the year = 400-fold per annum; but the setting out of one caban of\r\nmaize grain occupies five times the surface required for the planting\r\nof the same measure of rice grain. An ordinary caban of land is 8,000\r\nsquare Spanish yards (_vide_ Land Measure, p. 271), and this superficie\r\nderives its denomination from the fact that it is the average area\r\noccupied by the planting out of one caban measure of rice grain. The\r\nmaize caban of land is quite a special measure, and is equal to 5 rice\r\ncabans. Estimating, therefore, the average yield of rice-paddy to be\r\n50 cabanes measure per ordinary caban of land, the same superficie,\r\nwere it suitable for maize-raising, would give one-fifth of 400-fold\r\nper annum = 80 cabanes measure of maize per rice caban of land.\r\n\r\nThe current price of maize, taking the average in several provinces,\r\nis rarely above that of paddy for the same measure, whilst it is often\r\nlower, according to the demand, which is influenced by the custom of\r\nthe natives in the vicinity where it is offered for sale.\r\n\r\nIt is eaten after being pulverized between stone or hardwood slabs with\r\nthe surfaces set horizontally, the upper one being caused to revolve\r\non the lower one, which is stationary. In many village market-places\r\none sees heads of maize roasted and exposed for sale. This is of\r\na special quality, grown in alluvial soil--the intervals of rivers\r\nwhich overflow at certain seasons of the year. Three crops per annum\r\nare obtainable on land of this kind, so that the supply is constant\r\nall the year round. Before the American occupation, the price of the\r\nraw maize-heads to the market-sellers was about 60 cuartos per 100,\r\nwhich they retailed out roasted at one cuarto each (3 1/2 cuartos\r\nequal about one penny); the profit was therefore proportionately\r\nlarge when local festivities created a demand.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe _Cacao-tree_--(_Theobroma cacao_, or \"Food of the gods,\" as Linnaeus\r\ncalled it)--a native of Central America, flourishes in these Islands\r\nin the hot and damp districts.\r\n\r\nIt is said to have been imported into the Philippines towards the end\r\nof the 17th century from Mexico, where it has been in very ancient\r\nuse. Gaspar de San Agustin records the following [141]:--\"In the year\r\n1670 a navigator, Pedro Brabo de Lagunas, brought from Acapulco a pot\r\ncontaining a cacao-plant which he gave to his brother, Bartolome Brabo,\r\na priest in Camarines, from whom it was stolen by a Lipa native,\r\nJuan del Aguila, who hid it and took care of it, and from it was\r\npropagated all the original Philippine stock.\"\r\n\r\nOutside the tropics the tree will grow in some places, but gives no\r\nfruit. The Philippine quality is very good, and compares favourably\r\nwith that of other countries, the best being produced between latitudes\r\n11 deg. and 12 deg. N.\r\n\r\nThe cultivation of cacao is an extremely risky and delicate business,\r\nas, often when the planter's hopes are about to be realized, a slight\r\nstorm will throw down the almost-ripened fruit in a day. A disease\r\nsometimes attacks the roots and spreads through a plantation. It\r\nwould be imprudent, therefore, to devote one's time exclusively to\r\nthe cultivation of this product at the risk of almost instantaneous\r\nruin. Usually, the Philippine agriculturist rightly regards cacao\r\nonly as a useful adjunct to his other crops. In the aspect of a cacao\r\nplantation there is nothing specially attractive. The tree itself\r\nis not pretty. The natives who grow the fruit usually make their own\r\nchocolate at home by roasting the beans over a slow fire, and after\r\nseparating them from their husks (like almond-skins), they pound\r\nthem with wet sugar, etc., into a paste, using a kind of rolling-pin\r\non a concave block of wood. The roasted beans should be made into\r\nchocolate at once, as by exposure to the air they lose flavour. Small\r\nquantities of cacao are sent to Spain, but the consumption in the\r\nColony, when made into chocolate [142] by adding sugar, vanilla,\r\ncinnamon, etc., to counteract the natural bitterness of the bean,\r\nis considerable. In making the paste, a large quantity of sugar is\r\nadded, varying from one-third of its weight to equal parts, whilst\r\none pod of vanilla is sufficient for 1 1/2 lbs. of cacao. Chocolate\r\nis often adulterated with roasted rice and _Pili_ nuts. The roasted\r\n_Pili_ nut alone has a very agreeable almond taste. As a beverage,\r\nchocolate is in great favour with the Spaniards and half-castes and\r\nthe better class of natives. In every household of any pretensions\r\nthe afternoon caller is invited to \"merendar con chocolate,\" which\r\ncorresponds to the English \"5 o'clock tea.\"\r\n\r\nThe cacao-beans or kernels lie in a fruit something like a gherkin,\r\nabout 5 inches long and 3 inches in diameter, and of a dark reddish\r\ncolour when ripe. The tree bears its fruit on the main branches, or\r\non the trunk itself, but never on twigs or thin branches. The fruit\r\ncontains from 15 to 25 beans, in regular rows, with pulpy divisions\r\nbetween them like a water-melon. The kernels are about the size,\r\nshape, and colour of almonds, obtuse at one end, and contain a fatty\r\nor oily matter to the extent of one-half their weight. In order to make\r\n\"soluble cocoa\" as sold in Europe this fatty substance is extracted.\r\n\r\nThe beans are planted out at short distances in orchards, or in the\r\ngarden surrounding the owner's dwelling. The tree, in this Colony,\r\ndoes not attain a great height--usually up to 10 feet--whereas in its\r\nnatural soil it grows up to 30 feet at least. Like coffee, it bears\r\nfruit in the fourth year, and reaches maturity in the sixth year. The\r\nfair annual yield of a tree, if not damaged by storms or insects,\r\nwould be about three pints measure of beans, which always find a ready\r\nsale. The tree is most delicate; a slight laceration of the root,\r\nor stagnant water near it, may kill it; it needs a moisture-laden\r\nsultry air, which, however, must not exceed 75 deg. Fahr.\r\n\r\nIf all went well with the crop, large profits might accrue to the\r\ncacao-planter, but it rarely happens (perhaps never) during the six\r\nmonths of fruit-ripening that losses are not sustained by hurricanes,\r\ndisease in the tree, the depredations of parrots, monkeys, rats,\r\nand other vermin, etc. Practically speaking, cacao-planting should\r\nonly be undertaken in this Colony by agriculturists who have spare\r\ncapital and can afford to lose a crop one year to make up for it in\r\nthe next. The venture pays handsomely in fortunate seasons, but it\r\nis not the line of planting to be taken up by hand-to-mouth colonists\r\nwho must seek immediate returns, nor as a sole occupation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_Castor Oil_ is obtained in a few places from the seeds of the _Palma\r\nChristi_ or _Ricinus communis_, but the plant is not cultivated,\r\nand the oil has not yet become an article of current trade.\r\n\r\n_Gogo_ (_Entada pursaetha_), sometimes called _Bayogo_ in Tagalog,\r\nis a useful forest product in general demand, on sale at every\r\nmarket-place and native general shop. It is a fibrous bark, taken\r\nin strips of 3 or 4 feet long. It looks exactly like cocoa-nut coir,\r\nexcept that its colour is a little lighter and brighter. It is used\r\nfor cleansing the hair, for which purpose a handful is put to soak\r\nin a basin of water overnight, and the next morning it will saponify\r\nwhen rubbed between the hands. The soap which issues therefrom is then\r\nrubbed in the hair at the time of bathing. It is in common use among\r\nthe natives of both sexes and many Europeans. An infusion of _Gogo_ is\r\na purgative. If placed dry in the _tinaja_ jars (Tagalog, _Tapayan_),\r\ncontaining cacao-beans, the insects will not attack the beans.\r\n\r\n_Camote_ (_Convolvulus batatas_) is the sweet potato or Yam, the\r\nfoliage of which quickly spreads out like a carpet over the soil and\r\nforms tubers, like the common potato. It is a favourite article of\r\nfood among the natives, and in nearly every island it is also found\r\nwild. In kitchen-gardens it is planted like the potato, the tuber being\r\ncut in pieces. Sometimes it is dried (Tagalog, _Pacumbong camote_). It\r\nis also preserved whole in molasses (Tagalog, _Palubog na camote_).\r\n\r\n_Gabi_ (_Caladium_) is another kind of esculent root, palatable to\r\nthe natives, similar to the turnip, and throws up stalks from 1 to 3\r\nfeet high, at the end of which is an almost round leaf, dark green,\r\nfrom 3 to 5 inches diameter at maturity.\r\n\r\n_Potatoes_ are grown in Cebu Island, but they are rarely any larger\r\nthan walnuts. With very special care a larger size has been raised\r\nin Negros Island; also potatoes of excellent flavour and of a pinkish\r\ncolour are cultivated in the district of Benguet; in Manila there is\r\na certain demand for this last kind.\r\n\r\n_Mani_ (_Arachis hypogaea_), commonly called the \"Pea-nut,\" is a\r\ncreeping plant, which grows wild in many places. It is much cultivated,\r\nhowever, partly for the sake of the nut or fruit, but principally\r\nfor the leaves and stalks, which, when dried, even months old, serve\r\nas an excellent and nutritious fodder for ponies. It contains a large\r\nquantity of oil, and in some districts it is preferred to the fresh-cut\r\n_zacate_ grass, with which the ponies and cattle are fed in Manila.\r\n\r\nThe Philippine pea-nut is about as large as that seen in England. In\r\n1904 the American Bureau of Agriculture brought to the Islands for\r\nseed a quantity of New Orleans pea-nuts two to three times larger.\r\n\r\n_Areca Palm_ (_Areca calechu_) (Tagalog, _Bonga_), the nut of which\r\nis used to make up the chewing betel when split into slices about\r\none-eighth of an inch thick. This is one of the most beautiful\r\npalms. The nuts cluster on stalks under the tuft of leaves at\r\nthe top of the tall slender stem. It is said that one tree will\r\nproduce, according to age, situation, and culture, from 200 to 800\r\nnuts yearly. The nut itself is enveloped in a fibrous shell, like\r\nthe cocoa-nut. In Europe a favourite dentifrice is prepared from\r\nthe areca-nut.\r\n\r\n_Buyo_ (_Piper betle_) (Tagalog, _Igmo_), is cultivated with much\r\ncare in every province, as its leaf, when coated with lime made from\r\noyster-shells and folded up, is used to coil round the areca-nut,\r\nthe whole forming the _buyo_ (betel), which the natives of these\r\nIslands, as in British India, are in the habit of chewing. To the\r\nchew a quid of tobacco is sometimes added. A native can go a great\r\nnumber of hours without food if he has his betel; it is said to be\r\nstomachical. After many years of habit in chewing this nut and leaf\r\nit becomes almost a necessity, as is the case with opium, and it is\r\nbelieved that its use cannot, with safety, be suddenly abandoned. To\r\nthe newly-arrived European, it is very displeasing to have to converse\r\nwith a native betel-eater, whose teeth and lips appear to be smeared\r\nwith blood. The _buyo_ plant is set out on raised beds and trained\r\n(like hops) straight up on sticks, on which it grows to a height of\r\nabout 6 feet. The leaf is of a bright green colour, and only slightly\r\npointed. In all market-places, including those of Manila, there is\r\na great sale of this leaf, which is brought fresh every day.\r\n\r\n_Cocoanut_ (_Cocos nucifera_) plantations pay very well, and there is a\r\ncertain demand for the fruit for export to China, besides the constant\r\nlocal sales in the _tianguis_. [143] _Niog_ is the Tagalog name for\r\nthe cocoanut palm. Some tap the tree by making an incision in the\r\nflowering (or fruit-bearing) stalk, under which a bamboo vessel, called\r\na _bombon_, is hung to receive the sap. This liquid, known as _tuba_,\r\nis a favourite beverage among the natives. As many as four stalks of\r\nthe same trunk can be so drained simultaneously without injury to the\r\ntree. In the bottom of the _bombon_ is placed about as much as a desert\r\nspoonful of pulverized _Tongo_ bark (_Rhizophora longissima_) to give a\r\nstronger taste and bright colour to the _tuba_. The incision--renewed\r\neach time the _bombon_ is replaced--is made with a very sharp knife,\r\nto which a keen edge is given by rubbing it on wood (_Erythrina_)\r\ncovered with a paste of ashes and oil. The sap-drawing of a stalk\r\ncontinues incessantly for about two months, when the stalk ceases to\r\nyield and dries up. The _bombons_ containing the liquid are removed,\r\nempty ones being put in their place every twelve hours, about sunrise\r\nand sunset, and the seller hastens round to his clients with the\r\nmorning and evening draught, concluding his trade at the market-place\r\nor other known centres of sale. If the _tuba_ is allowed to ferment,\r\nit is not so palatable, and becomes an intoxicating drink. From the\r\nfermented juice the distilleries manufacture a spirituous liquor,\r\nknown locally as cocoa-wine. The trees set apart for _tuba_ extraction\r\ndo not produce nuts, as the fruit-forming elements are taken away.\r\n\r\nThe man who gets down the _tuba_ has to climb the first tree, on the\r\ntrunk of which notches are cut to place his toes in. From under the\r\ntuft of leaves two bamboos are fastened, leading to the next nearest\r\ntree, and so on around the group which is thus connected. The bottom\r\nbamboo serves as a bridge, and the top one as a handrail. Occasionally\r\na man falls from the top of a trunk 70 or 80 feet high, and breaks his\r\nneck. The occupation of _tuba_ drawing is one of the most dangerous.\r\n\r\nWhen the tree is allowed to produce fruit, instead of yielding _tuba_,\r\nthe nuts are collected about every four months. They are brought\r\ndown either by a sickle-shaped knife lashed on to the end of a long\r\npole, or by climbing the tree with the knife in hand. When they are\r\ncollected for oil-extraction, they are carted on a kind of sleigh,\r\n[144] unless there be a river or creek providing a water-way, in which\r\nlatter case they are tied together, stalk to stalk, and floated in\r\na compact mass, like a raft, upon which the man in charge stands.\r\n\r\nThe water or milk found inside a cocoanut is very refreshing to the\r\ntraveller, and has this advantage over fresh water, that it serves\r\nto quench the thirst of a person who is perspiring, or whose blood\r\nis highly heated, without doing him any harm.\r\n\r\nWell-to-do owners of cocoanut-palm plantations usually farm out to\r\nthe poorer people the right to extract the _tuba_, allotting to each\r\nfamily a certain number of trees. Others allow the trees to bear fruit,\r\nand although the returns are, theoretically, not so good, it pays the\r\nowner about the same, as he is less exposed to robbery, being able\r\nmore closely to watch his own interests. The trees bear fruit in the\r\nfifth year, but, meanwhile, care must be taken to defend them from\r\nthe browsing of cattle. If they survive that period they will live\r\nfor a century. At seven years' growth the cocoanut palm-tree seldom\r\nfails to yield an unvarying average crop of a score of large nuts,\r\ngiving a nett profit of about one peso per annum.\r\n\r\nThe cocoanut is largely used for culinary purposes in the Islands. It\r\nis an ingredient in the native \"curry\" (of no resemblance to Indian\r\ncurry), and is preserved in several ways, the most common being the\r\n_Bocayo_, a sort of cocoanut toffee, and the _Matamis na macapuno_,\r\nwhich is the soft, immature nut preserved in molasses.\r\n\r\nIn the Provinces of Tayabas, La Laguna, E. Batangas and district of La\r\nInfanta, the cocoanut-palm is extensively cultivated, solely for the\r\npurpose of extracting the oil from the nut. The cocoanut-oil factories\r\nare very rough, primitive establishments, usually consisting of eight\r\nor ten posts supporting a nipa palm-leaf roof, and closed in at all\r\nsides with split bamboos. The nuts are heaped for a while to dry and\r\nconcentrate the oil in the fruit. Then they are chopped, more or less,\r\nin half. A man sits on a board with his feet on a treadle, from which a\r\nrope is passed over, and works to and fro a cylindrical block, in the\r\nend of which is fixed an iron scraper. He picks up the half-nuts one\r\nat a time, and on applying them to the scraper in motion, the white\r\nfruit, or pith, falls out into a vessel underneath. These scrapings\r\nare then pressed between huge blocks of wood to express the oil, and\r\nthe mass is afterwards put into cast-iron cauldrons, of Chinese make,\r\nwith water, which is allowed to simmer and draw out the remaining\r\nfatty particles, which are skimmed off the surface. When cold, it\r\nis sent off to market in small, straight-sided kegs, on ponies which\r\ncarry two kegs--one slung on each side. The average estimated yield of\r\nthe cocoanuts, by the native process, is as follows, viz.:--250 large\r\nnuts give one cwt. of dried coprah, yielding, say, 10 gallons of oil.\r\n\r\nSmall quantities of Cocoanut Oil (Tagalog, _Languis ng niog_)\r\nare shipped from the Philippines, but in the Colony itself it is\r\nan important article of consumption. Every dwelling, rich or poor,\r\nconsumes a certain amount of this oil nightly for lighting. For this\r\npurpose it is poured into a glass half full of water, on which it\r\nfloats, and a wick, made of pith, called _tinsin_, introduced by\r\nthe Chinese, is suspended in the centre of the oil by a strip of\r\ntin. As the oil is consumed, the wick is lowered by slightly bending\r\nthe tin downwards. There are few dwelling-houses, or huts, without a\r\nlight of some kind burning during the whole night in expectation of\r\na possible earthquake, and the vast majority use cocoanut oil because\r\nof the economy.\r\n\r\nIt is also in use for cooking in some out-of-the-way places, and\r\nis not unpalatable when quite fresh. It is largely employed as a\r\nlubricant for machinery, for which purpose, however, it is very\r\ninferior. Occasionally it finds a medicinal application, and the\r\nnatives commonly use it as hair-oil. In Europe, cocoa-nut oil is\r\na white solid, and is used in the manufacture of soap and candles;\r\nin the tropics it is seldom seen otherwise than in a liquid state,\r\nas it fuses a little above 70 deg. Fahr.\r\n\r\nIt is only in the last few years that Coprah has acquired importance as\r\nan article of export. There are large cocoanut plantations on all the\r\nprincipal islands, whence supplies are furnished to meet the foreign\r\ndemand, which is likely to increase considerably.\r\n\r\nFor figures of _Coprah_ Shipments, _vide_ Chap. xxxi., \"Trade\r\nStatistics.\"\r\n\r\nUses are also found for the hard Shell of the nut (Tagalog, _Baoo_). In\r\nnative dwellings these shells serve the poor for cups (_tabo _) and a\r\nvariety of other useful domestic utensils, whilst by all classes they\r\nare converted into ladles with wooden handles. Also, when carbonized,\r\nthe shell gives a black, used for dyeing straw hats.\r\n\r\nVery little use is made of the Coir (Tagalog, _Bunot_), or outer\r\nfibrous skin, which in other countries serves for the manufacture\r\nof cocoanut matting, coarse brushes, hawsers, etc. It is said that\r\ncoir rots in fresh water, whereas salt water strengthens it. It\r\nwould therefore be unsuitable for running rigging, but for ships'\r\ncables it cannot be surpassed in its qualities of lightness and\r\nelasticity. As it floats on water, it ought to be of great value\r\non ships, whilst of late years its employment in the manufacture of\r\nlight ocean telegraph cables has been seriously considered, showing,\r\nas it does, an advantage over other materials by taking a convex curve\r\nto the water surface--an important condition in cable-laying. [145]\r\nThe Spaniards call this product _Banote_. In this Colony it often\r\nserves for cleaning floors and ships' decks, when the nut is cut into\r\ntwo equal parts across the grain of the coir covering, and with it\r\na very high polish can be put on to hardwoods.\r\n\r\nThe stem of the Cocoanut Palm is attacked by a very large beetle\r\nwith a single horn at the top of its head. It bores through the bark\r\nand slightly injures the tree, but I never heard that any had died\r\nin consequence. In some countries this insect is described as the\r\nrhinoceros beetle, and is said to belong to the _Dynastidae_ species.\r\n\r\nIn the Philippines, the poorest soil seems to give nourishment to the\r\ncocoanut-palm; indeed, it thrives best on, or near, the sea-shore,\r\nas close to the sea as where the beach is fringed by the surf at high\r\ntide. The common cocoanut-palm attains a height of about sixty feet,\r\nbut there is also a dwarf palm with the stem sometimes no taller\r\nthan four feet at full growth, which also bears fruit, although less\r\nplentifully. A grove of these is a pretty sight.\r\n\r\nSir Emerson Tennent, referring to these trees in Ceylon, is reported\r\nto have stated [146] that the cocoanut-palm \"acts as a conductor\r\nin protecting houses from lightning. As many as 500 of these trees\r\nwere struck in a single _pattoo_ near Pattalam during a succession\r\nof thunderstorms in April 1859.\"--_Colombo Observer_.\r\n\r\n_Nipa Palm_ (_Nipa fruticans_) is found in mangrove swamps and flooded\r\nmarshy lands. It has the appearance of a gigantic fern, and thrives\r\nbest in those lands which are covered by the sea at high tide. In the\r\nsame manner as the cocoanut-palm, the sap is extracted by incision made\r\nin the fruit-bearing stalk, and is used for distilling a liquid known\r\nas nipa wine, which, however, should properly be termed a spirit. The\r\nleaves, which are very long, and about three to five inches wide,\r\nare of immense value in the country for thatched roofs. Nipa is not\r\nto be found everywhere; one may go many miles without seeing it, in\r\ndistricts devoid of marshes and swampy lowlands. In El Abra district\r\n(Luzon Is.) nipa is said to be unknown. In such places, another\r\nmaterial supplies its want for thatching, viz.:--\r\n\r\n_Cogon_ (_Saccharum koenigii_), a sort of tall jungle grass with a\r\nvery sharp edge, plentifully abundant precisely where nipa cannot be\r\nexpected to grow. I have ridden through cogon five feet high, but a\r\nfair average would be about three to four feet. It has simply to be\r\ncut and sun-dried and is ready for roof thatching.\r\n\r\nThe _Cotton-tree_ (_Gossypium herbaceum_, Linn. ?), (Tagalog,\r\n_Bulac_), is found growing in an uncultivated state in many islands\r\nof the Archipelago. Long-staple cotton was formerly extensively\r\ncultivated in the Province of Ilocos Norte, whence, many years ago,\r\nlarge quantities of good cotton-stuffs were exported. This industry\r\nstill exists. The cultivation of this staple was, however, discouraged\r\nby the local governors, in order to urge the planting of tobacco for\r\nthe Government supplies. It has since become difficult to revive the\r\ncotton production, although an essay, in pamphlet form (for which\r\na prize was awarded in Madrid), was gratuitously distributed over\r\nthe Colony in 1888 with that object. Nevertheless, cotton spinning\r\nand weaving are still carried on, on a reduced scale, in the Ilocos\r\nprovinces (Luzon west coast).\r\n\r\nWild cotton is practically useless for spinning, as the staple is\r\nextremely short, but perhaps by hybridization and careful attention its\r\nculture might become valuable to the Colony. The pod is elliptical,\r\nand the cotton which bursts from it at maturity is snow-white. It\r\nis used for stuffing pillows and mattresses. It was a common thing,\r\nbefore the American occupation, to see (wild) cotton-trees planted\r\nalong the highroad to serve as telegraph-posts; by the time the seed\r\nis fully ripe, every leaf has fallen, and nothing but the bursting\r\npods remain hanging to the branches.\r\n\r\nThe _Buri Palm_ is a handsome species, of tall growth, with fan-like\r\nleaves. Its juice serves as a beverage resembling _tuba_. The trunk\r\nyields a sago flour. The leaves are beaten on boulder stones to extract\r\na fibre for rope-making, of great strength and in constant demand.\r\n\r\nThe _Dita Tree_, said to be of the family of the _Apocynese_ and\r\nknown to botanists as _Alstonia scholaris_, is possibly a species of\r\ncinchona. The pulverized bark has a bitter taste like quinine, and\r\nis successfully used by the natives to allay fever. A Manila chemist\r\nonce extracted from the bark a substance which he called _ditaine_,\r\nthe yield of crystallizable alkaloid being 2 per cent.\r\n\r\n_Palma Brava_ (_Coripha minor_) (Tagalog, _Banga_), [147] is a species\r\nof palm, the trunk of which is of great local value. It is immensely\r\nstrong, and will resist the action of water for years. These trees are\r\nemployed as piles for quay and pier making--for bridges, stockades,\r\nand in any works where strength, elasticity, and resistance to water\r\nare required in combination. When split, a fibrous pith is found\r\nin the centre much resembling cocoanut coir, but the ligneous shell\r\nof the stem still retains its qualities of strength and flexibility,\r\nand is used for vehicle-shafts, coolies' carrying-poles, and a variety\r\nof other purposes.\r\n\r\n_Bambusa_ (_Bambusa arundinacea_) is a graminifolious plant--one of the\r\nmost charmingly picturesque and useful adornments of Nature bestowed\r\nexuberantly on the Philippine Islands. It grows in thick tufts in\r\nthe woods and on the banks of rivers. Its uses are innumerable, and\r\nit has not only become one of the articles of primary necessity to\r\nthe native, but of incalculable value to all in the Colony.\r\n\r\nThere are many kinds of bamboos, distinct in formation and size. The\r\nTagalog generic name for knotted bamboo is _Cauayan_; the Spanish\r\nname is _Cana espina_. The most common species grows to a height of\r\nabout 60 feet, with a diameter varying up to eight inches, and is of\r\nwonderful strength, due to its round shape and the regularity of its\r\njoints. Each joint is strengthened by a web inside. It is singularly\r\nflexible, light, elastic, and of matchless floating power. The fibre\r\nis tough, but being perfectly straight, it is easy to split. It has a\r\nsmooth glazed surface, a perfectly straight grain, and when split on\r\nany surface, it takes a high polish by simple friction. Three cuts\r\nwith the bowie-knife are sufficient to hew down the largest bamboo\r\nof this kind, and the green leaves, in case of extreme necessity,\r\nserve for horses' fodder.\r\n\r\nThere is another variety also hollow, but not so large as that just\r\ndescribed. It is covered with a natural varnish as hard as steel. It\r\nis also used for native cabin-building and many other purposes.\r\n\r\nA third species, seldom found more than five inches in diameter, is\r\nmuch more solid, having no cavity in the centre divided by webs. It\r\ncannot be applied to so many purposes as the first, but where great\r\nstrength is required it is incomparable.\r\n\r\nWhen the bamboo-plant is cultivated with the view of rendering it\r\nannually productive, the shoots are pruned in the dry season at a\r\nheight of about seven feet from the ground. In the following wet\r\nseason, out of the clump germinate a number of young shoots, which,\r\nin the course of six or eight months, will have reached their normal\r\nheight, and will be fit for cutting when required. Bamboo should be\r\nfelled in the dry season before the sap begins to ascend by capillary\r\nattraction. If cut out of season it is prematurely consumed by grub\r\n(_gojo_), but this is not much heeded when wanted in haste.\r\n\r\nThe northern native builds his hut entirely of bamboo with nipa\r\npalm-leaf or cogon thatching; in the Province of Yloilo I have seen\r\nhundreds of huts made entirely of bamboo, including the roofing. To\r\nmake bamboo roofing, the hollow canes are split longitudinally, and,\r\nafter the webbed joints inside have been cut away, they are laid on\r\nthe bamboo frame-work, and fit into each other, the one convexly,\r\nthe next one concavely, and so on alternately. In frame-work, no\r\njoiner's skill is needed; two-thirds of the bamboo are notched out on\r\none side, and the other third is bent to rectangle. A rural bungalow\r\ncan be erected in a week. When Don Manuel Montuno, the late Governor\r\nof Morong, came with his suite to stay at my up-country bungalow for\r\na shooting expedition, I had a wing added in three days, perfectly\r\nroofed and finished.\r\n\r\nNo nails are ever used, the whole being bound with _bejuco_. The walls\r\nof the cabin are made by splitting the bamboo, and, after removing\r\nthe webbed joints, each half is beaten out flat. Even in houses of\r\ncertain pretensions I have often seen split-bamboo flooring, which is\r\nhighly effective, as it is always clean and takes a beautiful polish\r\nwhen rubbed over a few times with plantain-leaves. In the parish\r\nchurch of Las Pinas, near Manila, there was an organ made of bamboo,\r\nof excellent tone, extant up to the year of the Revolution.\r\n\r\nWhen the poor village native wants to put up his house he calls\r\na _bayanin_, and his neighbours assemble to give him a hand. The\r\nbowie-knife is the only indispensable tool. One cuts the bamboo to\r\nlengths, another splits it, a third fits it for making the frame-work,\r\nanother threads the dried nipa-leaves for the roofing, and thus a\r\nmodest _bahay_ is erected in a week. The most practicable dwelling\r\nis the bamboo and nipa house, the only serious drawback being the\r\nrisk of fire.\r\n\r\nRafts, furniture of all kinds, scaffolding, spoons, carts, baskets,\r\nsledges, fishing-traps, fleams, water-pipes, hats, dry and liquid\r\nmeasures, cups, fencing, canoe-fittings, bridges, carrying-poles for\r\nany purpose, pitchforks, and a thousand other articles are made of\r\nthis unexcelled material. Here it serves all the purposes to which the\r\nosier is applied in Europe. It floats in water, serves for fuel, and\r\nropes made of it are immensely strong. Bamboo salad is prepared from\r\nthe very young shoots, cut as soon as they sprout from the root. The\r\nvalue of bamboo in Manila varies according to the season of the year\r\nand length of the bamboo, the diameter of course being proportionate.\r\n\r\n_Bojo_ (Tagalog, _Buho_) is a kind of cane, somewhat resembling the\r\nbamboo in appearance only. It has very few knots; is brittle, perfectly\r\nsmooth on the outer and inner surfaces--hollow, and grows to about\r\n25 feet high by 2 inches diameter, and is not nearly so useful as\r\nthe bamboo. It is used for making light fences, musical instruments,\r\nfishing-rods, inner walls of huts, fishing-traps, torches, etc.\r\n\r\n_Bejuco_, or Rattan-cane, belonging to the _Calamus_ family\r\n(Tagalog, _Hiantoc_, also _Dit-an_), is a forest product commonly\r\nfound in lengths of, say, 100 feet, with a maximum diameter of\r\nhalf-an-inch. It is of enormous strength and pliancy. Its uses are\r\ninnumerable. When split longitudinally it takes the place of rope\r\nfor lashing anything together; indeed, it is just as useful in the\r\nregions of its native habitat as cordage is in Europe. It serves for\r\nfurniture and bedstead-making, and it is a substitute for nails and\r\nbolts. Hemp-bales, sugar-bags, parcels of all kinds are tied up with\r\nit, and hats are made of it. The ring through a buffalo's nose is\r\nmade of whole rattan, to which is often attached a split strip for\r\na guiding-rein. Every joint in a native's hut, his canoe, his fence,\r\nhis cart, woodwork of any kind--indeed, everything to be made fast,\r\nfrom a bundle of sticks to a broken-down carriage, is lashed together\r\nwith this split material, which must, when so employed, be bent with\r\nthe shiny skin outside, otherwise it will infallibly snap. The demand\r\nfor this article is very large.\r\n\r\n_Bush-rope_ (_Calamus maximus_) (Tagalog, _Palasan_) is also a forest\r\nproduct, growing to lengths of about 100 feet, with a maximum diameter\r\nof one inch and a quarter. It is immensely strong. It is used for raft\r\ncables for crossing rivers, stays for bamboo suspension-bridges, and a\r\nfew other purposes. It is sometimes found with knots as far apart as 30\r\nfeet. It is a species quite distinct from the _Walking-stick Palasan_\r\n(_Calamus gracilis_) (Tagalog, _Tabola_) the appreciated feature of\r\nwhich is the proximity of the knots. I have before me a specimen 34\r\ninches long with 26 knots.\r\n\r\n_Gum Mastic_ (_Almaciga_) is an article of minor importance in the\r\nPhilippine exports, the supply being very limited. It is said that\r\nlarge quantities exist; but as it is only procurable in almost\r\ninaccessible mountainous and uncivilized districts, first-hand\r\ncollectors in the provinces, principally Chinese, have to depend\r\nupon the services and goodwill of unsubdued tribes. It is chiefly\r\nobtained by barter, and is not a trade which can be worked up\r\nsystematically. The exports of this product fluctuate considerably\r\nin consequence. For figures of _Gum Mastic_ shipments, _vide_ Chap,\r\nxxxi., \"Trade Statistics.\"\r\n\r\n_Gutta-percha_ was formerly a more important article of trade in these\r\nIslands until the Chinese drove it out of the market by adulteration. A\r\nlittle is shipped from Zamboanga.\r\n\r\n_Wax_ (Tagalog, _patquit_) and cinnamon are to be found in much the\r\nsame way as gum mastic. There is a large consumption of wax in the\r\nIslands for candles used at the numerous religious feasts. The cinnamon\r\nis very inferior in quality. It is abundant in Mindanao Island, but,\r\nlike gum mastic, it can only be procured in small quantities, depending\r\non the caprice or necessities of the mountain-tribes. Going along the\r\nseashore in Zamboanga Province, on one occasion, I met a mountaineer\r\ncarrying a bundle of cinnamon to Zamboanga Port--many miles distant--to\r\nsell the bark to the Chinese at [Peso}8 per picul. I bought his load,\r\nthe half of which I sent to Spain, requesting a friend there to\r\nsatisfy my curiosity by procuring a quotation for the sample in the\r\nBarcelona market. He reported that the quality was so low that only\r\na nominal price could be quoted, and that it stood nowhere compared\r\nwith the carefully cultivated Ceylon product.\r\n\r\n_Edible Bird's Nest_ (_Collocalia troglodytes--Coll. nodifica\r\nesculenta_ Bonap.) is an article of trade with the Chinese, who readily\r\npurchase it at high prices. It is made by a kind of sea-swallow, and\r\nin appearance resembles vermicelli, variegated with blood-coloured\r\nspots. The nests are found in high cliffs by the sea, and the natives\r\nengaged in their collection reach them by climbing up bush-rope\r\nor bamboos with the branch-knots left on to support themselves with\r\ntheir toes. It is a very dangerous occupation, as the nests are always\r\nbuilt high in almost inaccessible places. The Filipino risks his life\r\nin collecting them, whilst the Chinaman does the safe and profitable\r\nbusiness of trading in the article. In the Philippines the collection\r\nbegins in December, and the birds deprived of their nests have then\r\nto build a second nest for laying their eggs. These second nests are\r\ngathered about the end of January, and so on up to about the fourth\r\ncollection. Each successive nest decreases in commercial value, and\r\nthe last one is hardly worth the risk of taking. Even though there\r\nmight be venturesome collectors who would dislodge the last nests,\r\nthe wet season fortunately sets in and prevents their being reached,\r\nhence the bird is at length able to continue propagation. Bird's-nest\r\nsoup is a delicacy in great demand in China.\r\n\r\nThese nests are chiefly found in the Calamities group of islands,\r\nparticularly in Busuanga Island. The Sulu Archipelago and Palauan\r\nIsland also furnish a small quantity of edible birds'-nests.\r\n\r\n_Balate_, or Trepang, is a species of sea-slug, for which the natives\r\nfind a ready sale to the Chinese at good prices. The fish is preserved\r\nby being gutted, cooked, and sun-dried, and has a shrimp taste. It\r\nis found in greatest quantities off the Calamianes and Palauan Islands.\r\n\r\n_Sapan-wood_ (_Caesalpina sappan_) (Tagalog, _Sibucao_, or _Sapang_),\r\nof an inferior quality compared with the Pernambuco wood, is a\r\nPhilippine product found in most of the large islands. It is a short,\r\nunattractive tree, with epigeous branches spreading out in a straggling\r\nmanner. The leaves are small and sparse. The wood is hard, heavy,\r\ncrooked, and full of knots. It sinks in water, and is susceptible\r\nof a fine polish. It is whitish when fresh cut, but assumes a deep\r\nred colour on exposure to the air. The only valuable portion is the\r\nheart of the branch, from which is taken a dye known in the trade as\r\n\"false crimson,\" to distinguish it from the more permanent cochineal\r\ndye. The whole of the colouring-matter can be extracted with boiling\r\nwater. It is usually shipped from Manila and Yloilo as dunnage,\r\na small quantity coming also from Cebu. For figures of _Sapan-wood_\r\nshipments, _vide_ Chap, xxxi., \"Trade Statistics.\"\r\n\r\nThe _Saps_ of certain Philippine trees serve to give a polished\r\ncoating to the smoothed surface of other woods. The kind which I\r\nhave experimented with most successfully is that of the _Ipil_ tree\r\n(_Eperna decandria_). This gives a glazed covering very similar to\r\nJapan-ware varnish. It takes better to the wood in a cold climate than\r\nin the tropics. I have tried it both in the Philippines and in Europe.\r\n\r\n_Dye Saps_ are also numerous--for instance, that of the species\r\n_Marsedenia_, called in Bicol dialect _Payanguit_ and _Aringuit_,\r\nwith which hemp can be dyed blue; the juice of the skin of a root,\r\nknown in Bicol as _Morinda_, is used for dyeing hemp red; the sap\r\nof the _Talisay_ tree (_Terminalia mauritiana_) gives a black dye,\r\nand that of the _Calumpit_ tree (_Terminalia edulis_) is a good\r\nstraw-coloured dye.\r\n\r\n_Hardwoods_.--These Islands are remarkably rich in valuable\r\ntimber-trees. For some of the details which I will give of the\r\nproperties and applicability of the varieties in general demand,\r\nI am indebted to Mr. H. G. Brown (of H. G. Brown & Co. Limited,\r\n[148] steam saw-mill proprietors in Tayabas Province), admitted to\r\nbe the most experienced person in this branch of Philippine trade.\r\n\r\n_Aranga_ (_Homalium_) gives logs up to 75 feet long by 24 inches\r\nsquare. It is specially used for sea piling and all kinds of marine\r\nwork which is subject to the attacks of sea-worm (_Teredo navalis_).\r\n\r\n_Acle_ (_Mimosa acle)_ gives logs up to 32 feet by 28 inches square. It\r\nis strong, tenacious, and durable, whilst it has the speciality\r\nof being difficult to burn, and is much used in house-building; it\r\npolishes well, and is much prized by the natives. It is supposed to\r\nbe identical with the _Payengadu_ of Burmah.\r\n\r\n_Anagap_ (_Pithecolobium montanum_, Benth.) gives logs up to 18 feet\r\nlong by 16 inches square. It is sometimes used for house furniture\r\nand fittings and for other purposes where a light durable wood is\r\nwanted and is not exposed to sun and rain.\r\n\r\n_Apiton_ (_Dipterocarpus griffithi_, Miq.) gives logs up to 70 feet\r\nlong by 24 inches square. It contains a gum of which incense is made,\r\nis light when seasoned, works well, and will serve for furniture and\r\ngeneral joiner's purposes.\r\n\r\n_Antipolo_ (_Artocarpus incisa_) is much esteemed for vessels' outside\r\nplanking, keels, etc. It is light, very strong, resists sea-worm\r\n(_Teredo navalis_) entirely, and effects of climate. It does not warp\r\nwhen once seasoned, and is a most valuable wood.\r\n\r\n_Anobing_ (_Artocarpus ovata)_ is said to resist damp as well as\r\n_Molave_ does, but it is not appreciated as a good hardwood. It is\r\nplentiful, especially in the district of Laguna de Bay.\r\n\r\n_Betis_ (_Azaola--Payena betis?_) gives logs up to 65 feet long by\r\n20 inches square. It is proof against sea-worm, is used for salt or\r\nfresh water piling, piers, wharves, etc.; also for keels and many other\r\nparts of ship-building, and where a first-class wood is indispensably\r\nnecessary. It is somewhat scarce.\r\n\r\n_Batitinan_ (_Lagerstroemia batitinan_) gives logs up to 40 feet long\r\nby 18 inches square. Is very strong, tough, and elastic; generally\r\nused for ships' outside planking above water. It stands the climate\r\nwell when properly seasoned; is a wood of the first quality, and can\r\nbe used for any purpose except those involving interment in the ground\r\nor exposure to ravages of sea-worm. This wood is very much stronger\r\nthan Teak, and could be used to advantage in its place for almost\r\nall purposes. It makes a good substitute for Black Walnut in furniture.\r\n\r\n_Banaba_ (_Munchaustia speciosa--Lagerstremis speciosa?_)--a strong\r\nand useful wood much used in house- and ship-building; it is thoroughly\r\nreliable when seasoned, otherwise it shrinks and warps considerably.\r\n\r\n_Bansalague_ (_Mimusops elengi_, Linn.) gives logs up to 45 feet long\r\nby 18 inches square. It seems to be known in Europe as bullet-tree\r\nwood. It can be driven like a bolt, and from this fact and its\r\ndurability it is frequently used for treenails in ship-building\r\nin Manila, etc. It is also used for axe and other tool-handles,\r\nbelaying-pins, etc., and on account of its compact, close grain it\r\nis admirably adapted for turning purposes; it lasts well in the ground.\r\n\r\n_Bancal_ (_Nauclea gluberrima)_ gives logs up to 24 feet long by\r\n16 inches square. This wood is of a yellow colour and very easy to\r\nwork. It is used for general joiner's work in house-building, etc.\r\n\r\n_Cedar_ (_Cedrela odorata_), of the same natural order as Mahogany\r\n(Linn.), gives logs up to 40 feet long by 35 inches square, and\r\nis used principally for cigar-boxes. In the Colony it is known as\r\n_Calantas_. It makes very handsome inside house-fittings.\r\n\r\n_Camagon_ or _Mabolo_ (a variety of _Diospyros philoshantera_) is\r\nprocured in roughly rounded logs of 9 feet and upwards in length,\r\nby up to 12 inches in diameter. It is a close-grained, brittle wood,\r\nand takes a good polish; its colour is black with yellow streaks,\r\nand it is used for furniture-making. It might be termed the Philippine\r\nCoromandel wood, and is sometimes referred to as \"false ebony.\"\r\n\r\n_Dungon_ (a variety of _Herculia ambiformis--Sterculia cymbiformis_,\r\nBlanco) grows up to 50 feet long, giving logs up to 20 inches\r\nsquare. It is sometimes called _Ironwood_, is very hard and durable,\r\nand specially strong in resisting great transverse pressure,\r\nor carrying such weight as a heavy roof. It is used for keels on\r\naccount of its great strength--it does not resist the sea-worm; it is\r\napplied to all purposes in Manila where more than ordinary strength\r\nis required when _Molave_ cannot be procured in sufficiently great\r\nlengths and _Ipil_ is unattainable.\r\n\r\n_Dinglas_ (_Decandria--Bucida comintana_) gives logs up to 30 feet\r\nby 16 inches square--occasionally even larger sizes. This will also\r\nserve as a substitute for Black Walnut in furniture; it is very strong,\r\nhard, and durable.\r\n\r\n_Ebony_ (_Diospyros nigra_) is also found in very limited quantities.\r\n\r\n_Guijo_ (_Dipterocarpus guijo_) gives logs up to 75 feet long by 24\r\ninches square--is very strong, tough and elastic. In Manila this wood\r\nis invariably used for carriage wheels and shafts. In Hong-Kong it\r\nis used, amongst other purposes, for wharf-decks or flooring.\r\n\r\n_Ipil_ (_Eperna decandria_) gives logs up to 50 feet long by 26 inches\r\nsquare. It has all the good qualities of _Molave_, except resistance to\r\nsea-worm (in which respect it is the same as Teak), and may be as much\r\nrelied on for duration under ground; for sleepers it equals _Molave_.\r\n\r\n_Lanete_ (_Anaser laneti_) gives logs up to 25 feet long by 18 inches\r\nsquare. It is useful for sculpture, musical instruments, decoration,\r\nturning, and cabinet purposes.\r\n\r\n_Lauan_ (_Dipterocarpus thurifera_) is obtained in sizes the same as\r\n_Guijo_. It is a light, useful wood, and easily worked. It is said\r\nthat the outside planks of the old Philippine-Mexican galleons were\r\nof this wood because it did not split with shot.\r\n\r\n_Molave_ (_Vitex geniculata_) (Tagalog, _Molauin_), gives logs up to 35\r\nfeet long by 24 inches square. It resists sea-worm (_Teredo navalis_),\r\nwhite ants (_Termes_), and action of climate, and consequently\r\nis specially valuable for work on the surface of or under ground,\r\nand generally for all purposes where an extra strong and durable\r\nwood is required. Often growing crooked, it is commonly used (where\r\nproduced and in adjacent countries) for frames of vessels. Owing to\r\nits imperviousness to ligniperdous insects and climate, it cannot\r\npossibly be surpassed for such purposes as railway-sleepers. This wood\r\nis practically everlasting, and is deservedly called by the natives,\r\n\"Queen of the Woods.\" It pays better to sell _Molave_ in baulks or\r\nlogs, rather than sawn to specification, because this tree has the\r\ngreat defect of being subject to heart-cup.\r\n\r\nMr. Thomas Laslett, in his work on timber, [149] says, in reference to\r\n_Molave_, \"It can be recommended to notice as being fit to supplement\r\nany of the hardwoods in present use for constructive purposes.\" From\r\nthe same work I have extracted the following record of experiments\r\nmade by Mr. Laslett with this wood:--\r\n\r\n\r\n    TENSILE EXPERIMENTS.--AVERAGE OF FIVE SPECIMENS\r\n\r\n    Dimensions of each piece.           2'' x 2'' x 30''\r\n    Specific gravity.                               1021.6\r\n    Weight the piece broke with.                  31,248    lbs.\r\n    Direct cohesion one square inch.               7,812\r\n\r\n\r\n    TRANSVERSE EXPERIMENTS.--AVERAGE OF THREE SPECIMENS\r\n\r\n    _Deflections_.\r\n    Total weight required to break each piece.         1.25 lbs.\r\n    Specific gravity.                                   .166\r\n    Weight reduced to specific gravity 1,000.          5.166\r\n    Weight required to break one square inch.      1,243.3  lbs.\r\n\r\n    With the apparatus weighing 390 lbs.            1013\r\n    After the weight was removed                    1231\r\n    At the crisis of breaking.                       310.83\r\n\r\n    N.B.--It breaks on test with a scarf-like fracture.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Mangachapuy_ (_Dipterocarpus mangachapuy--Vatica apteranthera_) gives\r\nlogs up to 55 feet long by 20 inches square. It is very elastic and\r\nwithstands the climate, when seasoned, as well as Teak. It is used\r\nin Manila for masts and decks of vessels and for all work exposed to\r\nsun and rain. It is much esteemed and in great demand by those who\r\nknow its good qualities.\r\n\r\n_Macasin_ can be used for interior house work and floors. It is\r\nsomewhat inferior to _Banaba_, but supplies its place when _Banaba_\r\nis scarce. It can be got in greater length and square than _Banaba_.\r\n\r\n_Malatapay_ (a variety of _Diospyros philoshantera_), veined black\r\nand red. It resembles _Camagon_.\r\n\r\n_Mancono_ is a very hard wood found in Mindanao Island; it is classed\r\nas a species of lignum-vitae.\r\n\r\n_Narra_ (_Pterocarpus palidus santalinus_) gives logs up to 35 feet\r\nlong by 26 inches square. It is the Mahogany of the Philippines,\r\ninasmuch as it is always employed in Manila in the manufacture of\r\nfurniture, for notwithstanding its somewhat open grain, it polishes\r\nwell, and is prettily marked. There is a variety of shades in different\r\nlogs varying from straw colour to blood-red, the former being more\r\ncommon; all are, however, equally esteemed. It is a first-rate wood\r\nfor general purposes. In the London market it is classed with the\r\n_Padouk_ of Burmah.\r\n\r\n_Palo Maria de Playa_ (_P. Polyandria--Calophyllum inophyllum_)\r\n(Tagalog, _Dangcalan_), is greatly appreciated for crooks and curves,\r\nbut as a rule cannot be found of suitable dimensions for large\r\nvessels. It is better than _Molave_ for this purpose, for, due to\r\nthe absence of acrid juices, iron bolts do not corrode in it. It is\r\nexceedingly tough and not so heavy as _Molave_.\r\n\r\n_Supa_ (_Sindora wallichii_, Benth.) gives logs up to 40 feet long\r\nby 28 inches square. It produces an oil, and is a strong wood for\r\ngeneral purposes, polishes well and can be used advantageously for\r\nhouse decorations and furniture.\r\n\r\n_Tindalo_ (_Eperna rhomboidea_) is about the same as _Acle_ in\r\nits principal features, but not notable for resisting fire. It is\r\nuseful for general purposes, and in particular for decorations and\r\nfurniture. It is somewhat brittle, and takes a high polish.\r\n\r\n_Yacal_ (_Dipterocarpus plagatus_) gives logs up to 50 feet long by\r\n22 inches square. It is proof against white ants, has great strength\r\nand tenacity, and is much valued in Manila for house-building, etc.\r\n\r\nNatives employed in the felling of timber often become very expert\r\nin the selection and appreciation of the standing trunks.\r\n\r\nThe approximate order of resistance of the best woods, estimated\r\nby their practical employment and not by theoretical comparative\r\nexperiments, would be as follows, viz.:--\r\n\r\n\r\n    HARDWOOD STRAINS\r\n\r\n    Tensile Strain.                  Transverse Strain.\r\n\r\n    1 Dungon.        8 Acle.         1 Molave.       8 Banaba.\r\n    2 Yacal.         9 Narra.        2 Camagon.      9 Yacal.\r\n    3 Ipil.         10 Tindalo.      3 Ipil.        10 Mangachapuy.\r\n    4 Mangachapuy.  11 Molave.       4 Acle.        11 Lauan.\r\n    5 Guijo.        12 Lauan.        5 Dungon.      12 Guijo.\r\n    6 Banaba.       13 Cedar.        6 Tindalo.     13 Cedar.\r\n    7 Camagon.      14 Lanete.       7 Narra.       14 Lanete.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe hardwoods of the Philippines, suitable for building and\r\ntrade requirements as described above, are those in general use\r\nonly. Altogether about fifty kinds exist, but whilst some are\r\nscarce, others do not yield squared logs of sufficient sizes to be\r\nof marketable value. Amongst these are the _Quercus concentrica_\r\n(Tagalog, _Alayan_), a sort of oak; the _Gimbernatia calamansanay_\r\n(Tagalog, _Calamansanay_); the _Cyrtocarpa quinquestyla_ (Tagalog,\r\n_Amaguis_), and others.\r\n\r\nTo carry on successfully a timber trade in this Colony, with ability\r\nto fulfil contracts, it is necessary to employ large capital. Firstly,\r\nto ensure supplies by the cutters, the trader must advance them sums\r\namounting in the total to thousands of pesos, a large percentage of\r\nwhich he can only nominally recover by placing them against future\r\nprofits; secondly, he must own several sailing-ships, built on a\r\nmodel suited to this class of business. Several Europeans have lost\r\nthe little money they had by having to freight unsuitable craft for\r\ntransport to the place of delivery, and by only advancing to the\r\nnative fellers just when they wanted logs brought down to the beach,\r\ninstead of keeping them constantly under advance. With sufficient\r\ncapital, however, a handsome profit is to be realized in this line\r\nof business, if it is not killed by too much new legislation.\r\n\r\nSo far Philippine woods have not met in London with the appreciation\r\ndue to their excellent qualities, possibly because they are not\r\nsufficiently well known. In China, however, they are in great demand,\r\nin spite of the competition from Borneo (Kudat and Sandakan) and\r\nAustralian shippers. Since the American occupation, large shipments\r\nof Oregon Pine have been made to the Colony: how this wood will stand\r\nthe climate is not yet ascertainable.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_Fruits_.--There are few really choice, luscious fruits in the\r\nPhilippines which can compare with the finest European species. Nothing\r\nin this Colony can equal our grape, peach, cherry, or strawberry.\r\n\r\nThe _Mango_ (_Manguifera indica--Pentandrie_, Linn.) ranks first in\r\nthese Islands. It is oblong--oval-shaped--flattened slightly on both\r\nsides, about five inches long, and of a yellow colour when ripe. It\r\nis very delicious, succulent, and has a large stone in the centre\r\nfrom which fibres run at angles. To cut it, the knife must be pressed\r\ndown from the thick end, otherwise it will come in contact with the\r\nfibres. Philippine mangoes are far superior to any others grown in the\r\nEast. This fruit has a slight flavour of turpentine, and, as to smell,\r\nManuel Blanco [150] doubts whether it more resembles bugs, onions,\r\nor tar. The trees are very large and majestic--the leaves are dark\r\ngreen, and the whole appearance strikingly noble. Great care is needed\r\nto rear the fruit. The natives cut notches in the trunk, and from the\r\ntime the tree begins to flower until the fruit is half matured, they\r\nlight fires on the ground under its branches, as the smoke is said to\r\nhasten the development. The tree begins to bear fruit at ten years old.\r\n\r\nThe first mangoes of the season are forced, and even picked before\r\nthey are ripe, so that they may more quickly turn yellow. They are\r\nbrought to the Manila market in February, and fetch as much as 20\r\ncents each. The natural ripening time is from the end of March. In\r\nthe height of the season they can be bought for two dollars per\r\nhundred. Epicures eat as many as ten to a dozen a day, as this\r\nfruit is considered harmless to healthy persons. Mango jelly is also\r\nappreciated by Europeans as well as natives. Luzon and Cebu Islands\r\nappear to produce more mangoes than the rest of the Archipelago. From\r\nmy eight mango-trees in Morong district I got annually two pickings,\r\nand one year three pickings from two trees.\r\n\r\nThere are other species of mango-tree of the genus _Terebinthaceae_,\r\nviz.:--_Manguifera anisodora, M. altissima, M. rostrata_ and\r\n_M. sinnata_.\r\n\r\nThe _Banana_ or _Plantain_ (_Musa paradisiaca_) is plentiful\r\nall over the Islands at all seasons. It grows wild, and is also\r\nlargely cultivated. It is the fruit of an herbaceous endogenous\r\nplant of the natural order _Musaceae_. It is said that the specific\r\nname _paradisiaca_ is derived, either from a supposition that the\r\nplantain was the forbidden fruit of Eden [151], or from an Arabic\r\nlegend that Adam and Eve made their first aprons of the leaves of\r\nthis tree, which grow to a length of five to six feet, with a width\r\nof 12 to 14 inches. Some 10 to 12 distinct varieties of bananas are\r\ncommonly to be seen, whilst it is asserted that there are over 50\r\nsorts differing slightly from each other. The Tagalog generic name\r\nfor this tree and fruit is _Saguing_. The species known in Tagalog\r\ndialect as _Lacatan_ and _Bongulan_, of a golden or orange tinge\r\nwhen the skin is removed and possessing a slight pineapple flavour,\r\nare the choicest. The _Tondoc_ is also a very fine class. The stem\r\nof the banana-plantain is cut down after fruiting, and the tree\r\nis propagated by suckers. [152] Renewal of the tree from the seed\r\nis only necessary every 12 to 18 years. The fruit is borne in long\r\nclusters on strong stalks which bend over towards the earth. As the\r\nsuckers do not all rise simultaneously, the stages of growth of the\r\nyoung fruit-bearing trees vary, so that there is a constant supply\r\nall the year round. Moreover, it is customary to cut down, and hang\r\nup in the house, the stalk sustaining the fruit before it is ripe,\r\nso that each fruit can be eaten as it matures. The glossy leaves\r\nof the banana-plantain are exceedingly beautiful. They are used for\r\npolishing hardwood floors; they serve as a substitute for plates at\r\nthe _tianguis_ and for wrapping-paper at the small native and Chinese\r\ngrocers' shops. In rural places if a _carromata_ driver cannot find\r\na leather horse-collar, he improvises one of banana-leaf.\r\n\r\nThe _Papaw_ tree (_Carica. papaya_) flourishes wild--a prolific\r\ngrowth--attains a height of 20 to 25 feet, and is very picturesque. The\r\nleaves emerge in a cluster from the top of the stem, and are about\r\n20 to 30 inches long. They can be used as a substitute for soap for\r\nwashing linen. The foliage has the peculiar property of making meat\r\nor poultry tender if hung up in the branches. The fruit is of a rich\r\nolive green, and remains so almost to maturity, when it quickly turns\r\nyellow. Both in shape and flavour it is something like a melon, and,\r\nalthough more insipid, it is refreshing in this climate. Containing a\r\nquantity of pepsine, it is often recommended by doctors as a dessert\r\nfor persons with weak digestive organs.\r\n\r\nBesides these fruits, there are _Pomelo_ oranges, about four times\r\nthe size of the largest European orange; ordinary-sized _Oranges_\r\nof three sorts; _Citron; Jack fruit_ (_Anona muricata,_ Linn., or\r\nmore probably _Artocarpus integrifolia_) (Tagalog, _Nangca); Custard\r\nApples (Anona squamosa,_ Linn.) (Tagalog, _Atis_); _Bread-fruit_\r\n(_Artocarpus camansi)_ (Tagalog, _Dalangian_ or _Dalamian_); _Lomboy_\r\n(_Calyptrantes jambolana--Icosandrie_, Linn.), which looks like a\r\ndamson; _Santol_ (_Sandoricum ternatum--Decandrie_, Linn.), delicious\r\nprepared in syrup; _Condol_, (_Monoecia syngenesia--Cucurbita\r\npepo aspera_), a kind of white pumpkin for preserving; _Limes_\r\n(Tagalog, _Limonsuangi_); small green _Limes_ (Tagalog, _Calamansi_)\r\nfor preserving; another kind called _Lucban_; a diminutive _Mango_\r\n(_Manguifera altissima_) (Tagalog, _Paho_), which is brined and then\r\nput in vinegar; _Pomegranates_ (_Punica granatum_); a very inferior\r\nspecies of wild _Strawberry_; _Chico_ (_Achras sapota--Hexandrie_,\r\nLinn.), the _Chico sapoti_ of Mexico, extremely sweet, the size and\r\ncolour of a small potato; _Lanson_ (_Lansium domesticum_), a curious\r\nkind of fruit of an agreeable sweet and acid flavour combined. The\r\npericarp is impregnated with a white viscous fluid, which adheres\r\nvery tenaciously to the fingers. When the inner membrane is removed\r\nthe edible portion is exhibited in three divisions, each of which\r\nenvelops a very bitter stone. It is abundant in La Laguna.\r\n\r\n_Guavas_ (_Psidium pyriferum guyava_, Linn.) (Tagalog, _Bayabas_) of\r\nvery fine quality, from which jelly is made, are found wild in great\r\nabundance. They are so plentiful on waste lands that I have never\r\nseen them cultivated. The peel is an excellent astringent. _Lemons_\r\n[153] of two kinds are grown--sometimes as many as a dozen of the small\r\nspecies, about the size of a walnut, may be seen hanging at one time\r\non a tree only 18 inches high; a well-known small species is called\r\n_Dayap_ in Tagalog. _Mangosteens_, the delicate fruit of the Straits\r\nSettlements, are found in the islands of Mindanao and Sulu. In Mindanao\r\nIsland, on the neck of land forming the western extremity, the _Durien_\r\nthrives. It is about as large as a pineapple, white inside, and when\r\nripe it opens out in three or four places. It is very delicious eating,\r\nbut has a fetid smell. The seeds, as large as beans, are good to eat\r\nwhen roasted. The tree bears fruit about every 20 years.\r\n\r\n_Pineapples_ (_Bromelia ananas_, Linn.) are abundant in the Southern\r\nIslands, where they are cultivated exclusively for the sake of the\r\nleaves, the delicate fibres of which are used to manufacture the fine,\r\ncostly texture known as _Pina_ (q.v.). This fruit, which is not so\r\nfine as the Singapore and Cuban species, is in little demand in the\r\nPhilippines, as it is justly considered dangerous to eat much of it.\r\n\r\n_Grape_ acclimatization has been attempted in the Philippines, but\r\nwith very mediocre results. Cebu seems to be the island most suitable\r\nfor vine culture, but the specimens of fruit produced can bear no\r\ncomparison with the European. In Naga (Cebu Is.) I have eaten green\r\n_Figs_ grown in the orchard of a friend's house.\r\n\r\n_Tamarinds_ (_Tamarindus indica_, Linn.) (Tagalog, _Sampaloc_)\r\nare never planted for the sake of the fruit. The tree grows wild,\r\nand the fruit resembles a bean. Picked whilst green, it is used by\r\nthe natives to impart a flavour to certain fish sauces. When allowed\r\nto ripen fully, the fruit-pod takes a light-brown colour--is brittle,\r\nand cracks all over under a slight pressure of the fingers. The whole\r\nof the ripe fruit can then be drawn out by pulling the bean-stalk. The\r\nripe tamarind appears to be little appreciated by any one, and it is\r\nextremely seldom seen, even in the form of a preserve, in a native\r\ndwelling. Containing, as it does, a large quantity of tannin, it is\r\nsometimes used by the Manila apothecaries, and I once heard that a\r\nsmall parcel was being collected for shipment to Italy.\r\n\r\nThe _Mabolo_ (_Diospyros discolor_) (Tagalog, _Mabolo_, also _Talang_)\r\nis a fruit of great external beauty and exquisite aroma. It is\r\nabout the size of a large peach, the pubescent skin being of a fine\r\nred colour, but it is not very good eating. _Chillies_ (_Capsicum\r\nminimum_, Blanco), _Ginger_ (_Zingiber officinale_, Linn.), _Capsicums_\r\n(_Capsicum tetragonum_, Mill), _Capers_ (_Capparris mariana_) and\r\n_Vanilla_ are found in a wild state. _Sago_ is produced in small\r\nquantities in Mindoro Island, where the sago-plant flourishes. The\r\npith is cut out, washed, sun-dried, and then pounded. The demand for\r\nthis nutritious article is very limited. In 1904 I found the _Cassava_\r\nplant growing near the south coast of Mindanao Island.\r\n\r\nThere are many other kinds of orchard and wild fruits of comparatively\r\ninferior quality, chiefly used by the natives to make preserves. There\r\nis also a large variety of tuberose and other vegetable products,\r\nnever eaten by Europeans, such as the favourite _Sincamas_\r\n(_Decandria--Pachyrhizus angulatus_), resembling a small turnip. The\r\nnatives have a taste for many fruits plucked half ripe.\r\n\r\nThe _Flowers_ of these Islands are too numerous for their description\r\nto come within the scope of this work. To the reader who seeks\r\nan exhaustive treatise on the Botany of the Philippines, I would\r\nrecommend Manuel Blanco's \"Flora de Filipinas,\" [154] from which I\r\nhave taken the following brief notes.\r\n\r\n\r\n                            _Philippine Flowers_\r\n                        _According to Manuel Blanco_\r\n\r\n                Orders.

(Tagalog, _Gabigabihan_).--A delicate\r\nbulb. Common in Pasig and Manila.\r\n\r\n_Amaryllis atamasco_, Blanco (Tagalog, _Bacong_).--A bulb. Grows to\r\n3 feet. Beautiful large red flower.

Of the few, the most popular\r\nin Manila is the _Sampaguita_ (probably a corruption of the Spanish\r\nname _Santa Paquita_), which is sold made up in necklet form on cotton.\r\n\r\nLooking on to the Pasig River at Manila in the early morning,\r\none often sees large masses of floating verdure of a small-cabbage\r\nappearance. This aquatic plant is the _Pistia stratiotes_, Linn.,\r\n(Tagalog, _Quiapo_).\r\n\r\nThe firewood in common use as fuel, in great demand, and known as\r\n_Raja de Tangal_, is the _Rhizophora longissima_. It is also useful\r\nfor fencing, roof-framing, etc. Another well-known firewood is the\r\n_Rhizophora gynnorhiza_ (Tagalog, _Bacauan_). _Langary_ is also used\r\nas firewood of an inferior quality. They are swamp-trees.\r\n\r\nThe species _Pteclobyum_ gives the \"Locust-bean,\" as sold at\r\nevery little sweetmeat shop in London. This tree (when raised\r\non or transplanted to highlands) may be called the friend of the\r\ncoffee-plant, for it opens its leaves in the sunshine to shade it and\r\ncloses them when rain is about to fall, so that the coffee-plant may\r\nbe refreshed by the water. Also, at night, it closes its leaves to\r\ngive the coffee-plant the benefit of the dew. Another peculiar feature\r\nis that the branches lopped off for household fuel can, when barked,\r\nbe used at once, without needing to be dried or seasoned. Its natural\r\nhabitat is the mangrove swamp, and the trunk and root give market fuel.\r\n\r\n_Colot-colotan_, or _Manquit_, is the Tagalog name given to the\r\n_Chrysopogon aciculatus_, Trin. (Spanish, _Amor seco_)--the little\r\nparticles like pointed grass-seeds which stick to one's trousers or\r\nskirt when crossing an uncultivated field and can only be removed by\r\npicking them out one by one.\r\n\r\nThe Tagalog affix _aso_, to the name of a botanical specimen,\r\nmeans _pseudo_, i.e. not the genuine species; v.g., _Sincamas_\r\nis the _Decandria--Pachyrhizus angulatus_ (_vide_ p. 321), whereas\r\n_Sincamas-aso_ is the _D.--Pachyrhizus montanus_.\r\n\r\nMany places take their names from trees and plants, v.g.:--\r\n\r\n\r\n    Antipolo        (Rizal)         a tree.\r\n    Bauang          (Batangas)      garlic.\r\n    Bulacan         (Bulacan)       a tree.\r\n    Capas           (Pangasinan)    the cotton-tree (Igorrote\r\n                                    dialect).\r\n    Camagon Is.                     a tree.\r\n    Cabuyao         (Laguna)        a tree.\r\n    Calumpit        (Bulacan)       a tree.\r\n    Culasi          (Antique)       a tree.\r\n    Iba             (Zambales)      a plant.\r\n    Lucbang         (Tayabas)       a small lime.\r\n    Lipa            (Batangas)      nettle.\r\n    Quiapo          (Manila suburb) an aquatic plant.\r\n    Sampaloc        (Manila suburb) the tamarind-tree.\r\n    Salomague       (Ilocos)        the tamarind-tree. (Igorrote\r\n                                    dialect).\r\n    Tabaco          (Albay)         the tobacco-plant.\r\n    Taal            (Batangas)      a tree (same as _Ipil_).\r\n    Talisay         (Batangas)      a tree.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Medicinal Herbs, Roots, Leaves, and Barks_ abound everywhere. Nature\r\nprovides ample remedies for dysenteric, strumatic, scorbutic, and\r\nmany other diseases. An extensive work on the subject was compiled by\r\nIgnacio de Mercado, the son of a Spanish Creole father and Tagalog\r\nmother, born in 1648 at Paranaque, seven miles from Manila. He was\r\nparish priest in Lipa in 1674, and subsequently held several other\r\nincumbencies up to his death, which took place in Bauang (Batangas)\r\non March 29, 1698. His MS. passed from the pharmacy of one religious\r\ncorporation to another to be copied, and for over a century after\r\nthe British occupation of Manila (1762-63) it was supposed to be\r\nlost. Finally, in 1876, it was discovered by Don Domingo Vidal y Soler,\r\nwho gave it to the Augustine friars for publication, but I am not\r\naware that it was ever printed. According to Manuel Blanco, Ignacio\r\nde Mercado's MS. describes 483 medicinal specimens, and attached\r\nto the description are 171 coloured sketches of medicinal plants,\r\nleaves, woods, and barks, and also 35 coloured sketches of plants,\r\netc., without any description of their medicinal properties. The only\r\none of these remedies which I have had occasion to test on myself\r\nis _Tagulauay Oil_, extracted from the leaves of the plant called in\r\nTagalog _Tangantangan_. It is an excellent styptic.\r\n\r\n_Ylang-Ylang_ (_Anona odoratissima_, Blanco; _Cananga odorata_,\r\nHook) and _Champaca_ (_Michelia champaca_, Linn.) yield odoriferous\r\nessential oils, and these fine perfumes are, especially the former,\r\nexported to foreign countries. The export of _Ylang-Ylang_ in the\r\nyears 1902 and 1903 amounted to 3,949 and 5,942 gallons respectively.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIX\r\n\r\nMineral Products\r\nCoal--Gold--Iron--Copper--Sulphur, Etc.\r\n\r\n\r\nOwing to the scarcity of manufacturing industries in this Colony,\r\nthe consumption of _Coal_ is very limited, and up to 1889 it hardly\r\nexceeded 25,000 tons per annum. In 1892 nearly double that quantity\r\nfound a market. In 1896 the coal imported from Newcastle (New South\r\nWales) alone amounted to 65,782 tons; in 1897 to 89,798 tons. A small\r\nproportion of this is employed in the forges, foundries, and a few\r\nsteam-power factories, most of them situated around Manila, but by\r\nfar the greater demand is for coaling steam-ships. Since the American\r\noccupation the increase of steam-shipping and the establishment\r\nof ice-plants all over the Colony have raised the consumption of\r\ncoal. Wood fuel is still so abundant in rural districts that coal\r\nwill probably not be in general request for the steam sugar-mills\r\nfor many years to come.\r\n\r\nAustralia, Great Britain, and Japan supply coal to this Colony;\r\nin 1892 Borneo traders sent several cargoes of inferior product to\r\nManila; nevertheless, local capital has been expended from time to\r\ntime in endeavours to work up the home deposits.\r\n\r\nPhilippine coal is more correctly speaking highly carbonized lignite\r\nof the Tertiary age, and analogous to Japanese coal. Batan Island,\r\noff the south-east coast of Luzon Island, is said to have the finest\r\nlignite beds in the Archipelago.\r\n\r\nThe island of Cebu contains large deposits of lignite. The mines\r\nof Compostela are estimated to be very rich in quantity and of\r\nmedium quality. The late owner, Isaac Conui, for want of capital,\r\nwas unable to develop them fully. Transport by buffalo-carts from\r\nthe mines to the coast was very deficient and costly, and Conui,\r\nwho was frequently my guest in Manila in 1883, unsuccessfully\r\nsought to raise capital for constructing a line of railway from the\r\ncollieries to Compostela village (east coast). They were then taken\r\nup by a Spaniard, with whom the Spanish Government made contracts\r\nfor coaling the gunboats. A tram line was laid down to the pits, but\r\nthere was a great lack of promptitude in deliveries, and I heard of\r\nships lying off the coaling-wharf for several hours waiting to _start_\r\ncoaling. The enterprise has by no means given an adequate return for\r\nthe over P100,000 invested in it up to the year 1897. The coal-mine of\r\nDanao, on the same coast, has not been more prosperous. When I visited\r\nit in 1896 it had not yielded a cent of nett profit. In 1904 I made\r\nthe acquaintance, in Cebu Island, of a holder of P47,000 interest\r\nin this enterprise. He told me that he had got no return for his\r\nmoney in it. He had spent P1,000 himself to have the mine inspected\r\nand reported on. He sent the report to his co-partners in Manila,\r\nand heard no more about it until he went to the capital, where he\r\nlearnt that the Managing Director had resigned, and no one knew who\r\nwas his successor, what had become of his report, or anything definite\r\nrelating to the concern.\r\n\r\nAnthracite has been found in Cebu, [155] and satisfactory trials have\r\nbeen made with it, mixed with British bituminous coal. Perhaps volcanic\r\naction may account for the volatile bituminous oils and gases having\r\nbeen driven off the original deposits. The first coal-pits were sunk\r\nin Cebu in the Valle de Masanga, but the poor commercial results led\r\nto their abandonment about the year 1860. There are also extensive\r\nunworked coal deposits a few miles from the west coast village of\r\nAsturias, which I visited in 1896 with a planter friend, Eugenio\r\nAlonso, who was endeavouring to form a coal-mining syndicate. The\r\n_Revista Minera_ (a Madrid mining journal) referred in 1886 to the\r\ncoal of the Alpaco Mountain, in the district of Naga (Cebu Is.) as\r\nbeing pure, dry, of easy combustion, carrying a strong flame, and\r\nalmost free from sulphur pyrites. Cebu coal is said to be of better\r\nquality and cleaner than the Labuan and Australian products, but its\r\nheating powers being less, it is less serviceable for long sea voyages.\r\n\r\nThe coal-mines in the hills around the Cumansi Valley, about eight\r\nmiles from the Cebu coast (Danao) have been worked for years without\r\nfinancial success. The quality is reported excellent. Indeed,\r\nin several of the larger islands of the Colony there are outcrop\r\nindications of workable coal, unobtainable for want of transport\r\nfacilities.\r\n\r\nIn the Province of Albay, the Sugod Collieries were started by a\r\ncompany formed in the year 1874. There were some fifteen partners,\r\neach of whom subscribed a capital of P14,300. One of these partners,\r\nCeferino de Aramburu, told me that for a while the result was so\r\ngood that a Manila banking firm offered to take over the concern\r\nfrom the shareholders at a premium of 20 per cent. upon the original\r\ncapital. About 4,000 tons of coal were extracted, most of which was\r\ngiven away as samples, in the hope of large contracts resulting from\r\nthe trials, although it is said that the consumption was too rapid,\r\nand that it had to be mixed with Cardiff coal. Seven pits were sunk,\r\nand the concern lingered on until the year 1881, when its working\r\nwas relinquished. The failure was attributed to the shallowness of\r\nthe pits, which were only 30 metres deep, whilst it was supposed that\r\nif the excavation had been continued before these pits were flooded,\r\nshale and limestone strata could have been removed, exposing a still\r\nmore valuable seam, in which case it might have been worth while\r\nproviding pumping-machinery. The cost of extraction and delivery on\r\nthe coast was estimated at 75 cents of a peso per ton, whilst Cardiff\r\ncoal in Manila was worth, at the time, about eight pesos per ton,\r\nand the Australian product ranged usually at one to one and a half\r\npesos below that figure, port tax unpaid.\r\n\r\nIn January, 1898, \"The Philippine Mining and Development Company,\r\nLimited,\" was formed in Hong-Kong with a capital of $1,600,000\r\n(Mex.) in 160,000 $10 shares for the development of Philippine\r\ncoal deposits and other industries, under the management of a\r\nScotch merchant of long standing and good repute in Manila (since\r\ndeceased). The Spanish-American conflict which arose four months\r\nlater impeded active operations by the company.\r\n\r\nIn May, 1902, a company styled \"Minas de Carbon de Batan\" was\r\nconstituted to purchase from and exploit the coal-mines of Messrs. Gil\r\nHermanos, situated in the Island of Batan, Sorsogon Province. The\r\npurchase price was fixed at P500,000, and the company's capital at\r\nP1,000,000 divided into 5,000 equal shares. Hopeful reports were made\r\non the property by an American, a Spanish, and a Japanese mining\r\nengineer respectively. When I interviewed the Managing Director of\r\nthe company, in Manila, two years after its formation, no dividend\r\nhad yet been paid to the shareholders.\r\n\r\n\r\n                _Comparative Analyses of Coal_\r\n\r\nSource.

The first was in the Lipa Mountain,\r\nwhere the mine was called \"San Nicolas de Tolentino\"; the second,\r\nin the Dobojan Mountain, was called \"Nuestra Senora de la Soledad de\r\nPuerta Vaga\"; the third, in Lipara, was named \"Mina de las Animas\";\r\nthe fourth, in the territory of San Antonio, took the name of \"San\r\nFrancisco,\" and the fifth, in the Minapa Mountains, was named \"Nuestra\r\nSenora de los Dolores,\" all in the district of Paracale, near the\r\nvillage of Mambulao. The conditions of Estorgo's licence were, that\r\none-fifth (_real quinto_) of the output should belong to the King;\r\nthat Estorgo was authorized to construct, arm, and garrison a fort\r\nfor his own defence against anticipated attacks from Mahometans,\r\nand that he should have the title of Castellano, or guardian of\r\nthe fort. It was found necessary to establish the smelting-works\r\nin Mambulao, so he obtained a licence to erect another fort there\r\non the same conditions, and this fort was named \"San Carlos.\" In a\r\nshort time the whole enterprise came to grief. Estorgo's neighbours,\r\ninstigated by native legal pettifoggers in Manila, raised endless\r\nlawsuits against him; his means were exhausted, and apparatus being\r\nwanted to work the mines, he had to abandon them.\r\n\r\nAbout the same time, the gold-mines of Pangotcotan and Acupan (Benguet\r\ndistrict) were worked to advantage by Mexicans, but how much metal was\r\nwon cannot be ascertained. The extensive old workings show how eagerly\r\nthe precious metal was sought in the past. The Spanish Government\r\ngranted only concessions for gold-mining, the title remaining in the\r\nCrown. Morga relates (1609) that the Crown royalty of one-tenth (_vide_\r\np. 53) of the gold extracted amounted to P10,000 annually. According\r\nto Centeno, the total production of gold in all the Islands in 1876\r\ndid not not exceed P3,600.\r\n\r\nDuring the Government of Alonso Fajardo de Tua (1618-24) it came to\r\nthe knowledge of the Spaniards that half-caste Igorrote-Chinese in\r\nthe north of Luzon peacefully worked gold-deposits and traded in the\r\nproduct. Therefore Francisco Carreno de Valdes, a military officer\r\ncommanding the Provinces of Pangasinan and Ilocos, obtained permission\r\nfrom the Governor to make a raid upon these Igorrote-Chinese and\r\nappropriate their treasure-yielding territory. After a seven days'\r\nmarch the Spanish gold-seekers and troops arrived at the deposits,\r\nwhere they took up their quarters without resistance. The natives held\r\naloof whilst mutual offers of peace were made. When the Spaniards\r\nthought they were in secure possession of the neighbourhood, the\r\nnatives attacked and slaughtered a number of them. The commander of the\r\ndistrict and the leader of the native troops were among the slain. Then\r\nthey removed the camp to a safer place; but provisions ran short and\r\nthe wet season set in, so the survivors marched back to the coast with\r\nthe resolution to renew their attempt to possess the spoil in the\r\nfollowing year. In the ensuing dry season they returned and erected\r\na fort, whence detachments of soldiers scoured the neighbourhood to\r\ndisperse the Igorrote-Chinese, but the prospectors do not appear to\r\nhave procured much gold.\r\n\r\nMany years ago a Spanish company was formed to work a gold-mine near\r\nthe mountain of Malaguit, in the Province of Camarines Norte, but it\r\nproved unsuccessful.\r\n\r\nAt the beginning of last century a company was founded, under the\r\nauspices of the late Queen Christina of Spain (great-grandmother of\r\nthe present King Alfonso XIII.), which was also an utter failure. I\r\nwas told that the company had spacious offices established in Manila,\r\nwhence occasionally the employees went up to the mines, situated near\r\nthe Caraballo Mountain, as if they were going to a picnic. When they\r\narrived there, all denoted activity--for the feast; but the mining\r\nwork they did was quite insignificant compared with the squandered\r\nfunds, hence the disaster of the concern.\r\n\r\nThe coast of Surigao (north-east extremity of Mindanao Is.) has been\r\nknown for centuries to have gold-deposits. A few years ago it was\r\nfound in sufficiently large quantities near the surface to attract the\r\nattention of capitalists. A sample of the washings was given to me,\r\nbut gold extraction was never taken up in an organized way in that\r\ndistrict. A friend of mine, a French merchant in Manila, told me in\r\n1886 that for a long time he received monthly remittances of 4 1/2\r\nto 5 1/2 lbs. of alluvial gold from the Surigao coast, extracted by\r\nthe natives on their own account. In the same district a Spaniard\r\nattempted to organize labour for systematic gold-washing, but the\r\nfriars so influenced the natives against him that he could only have\r\ncontinued his project at the risk of his life, therefore he gave it up.\r\n\r\nIn an independent way, the natives obtain gold from earth-washings in\r\nmany districts, particularly in the unsubdued regions of Luzon Island,\r\nwhere it is quite a common occupation. The product is bartered on the\r\nspot to the Chinese ambulant traders for other commodities. Several\r\ntimes, whilst deer-stalking near the river, a few miles past Montalban\r\n(Rizal), I have fallen in with natives washing the sand from the river\r\nbed in search of gold, and they have shown me some of their findings,\r\nwhich they preserve in quills.\r\n\r\nIn other places in Luzon Island gold is procured in very small\r\nquantities by washing the earth from the bottoms of pits dug from 20 to\r\n25 feet deep and 3 feet wide. The extraction of gold from auriferous\r\nrock is also known to the natives. The rock is broken by a stone on\r\nan anvil of the same material. Then the broken pieces are crushed\r\nbetween roughly-hewn stone rollers put in motion by buffaloes,\r\nthe pulverized ore being washed to separate the particles of the\r\nprecious metal. I should hardly think the yield was of much account,\r\nas the people engaged in its extraction seemed to be miserably poor.\r\n\r\nGold probably exists in all the largest islands of the Archipelago,\r\nbut in a dispersed form; for the fact is, that after centuries of\r\nsearch, large pockets or veins of it have never been traced to defined\r\nlocalities, and, so far as discoveries up to the present demonstrate,\r\nthis Colony cannot be considered rich in auriferous deposits. Until\r\nthe contrary has been proved, I venture to submit the theory that\r\nevery gold-bearing reef in these Islands, accessible to man, has been\r\ndisintegrated by volcanic action ages ago.\r\n\r\nIn 1887 a Belgian correspondent wrote to me inquiring about a company\r\nwhich, he stated, had been formed for working a Philippine mine of\r\nArgentiferous Lead. On investigation I learnt that the mines referred\r\nto were situated at Acsubing, near the village of Consolacion, and at\r\nPanoypoy, close to the village of Talamban in Cebu Island. They became\r\nthe property of a Frenchman [156] about the beginning of 1885, and so\r\nfar no shipment had been made, although the samples sent to Europe were\r\nsaid to have yielded an almost incredibly enormous amount of gold (!),\r\nbesides being rich in galena (sulphide of lead) and silver. I went to\r\nCebu Island in June, 1887, and called on the owner in Mandaue with\r\nthe object of visiting these extraordinary mines; but they were not\r\nbeing worked for want of funds, and he left for Europe the same year,\r\nthe enterprise being finally abandoned.\r\n\r\nIn 1893 \"The Philippines Mineral Syndicate\" was formed in London\r\nto work scientifically the historical Mambulao Gold Mines already\r\nreferred to. One pound shares were offered in these Islands and\r\nsubscribed to by all classes, from the British Consul at that time\r\ndown to native commercial clerks. Mr. James Hilton, a mining engineer,\r\nhad reported favourably on the prospects. After the usual gold-mining\r\nperiod of disappointment had passed away, an eccentric old gentleman\r\nwas sent out as an expert to revive the whole concern and set it\r\nupon a prosperous basis. I had many conversations with him in Manila\r\nbefore he went to Mambulao, where he soon died. Heavy machinery came\r\nout from Europe, and a well-known Manila resident, not a mining\r\nengineer, but an all-round smart man, was sent to Mambulao, and,\r\ndue to his ability, active operations commenced. This most recent\r\nearnest venture in Philippine gold-mining has not, however, so far\r\nproved to be a Golconda to the shareholders.\r\n\r\nThat there is gold in Mindoro Island is evident from the fact that\r\nthe Minguianes, a wild tribe, wear gold jewellery made by themselves,\r\nand come down to the coast villages to barter with this metal, for\r\nthey do not understand trading with the coin medium.\r\n\r\nAs a general rule, failure in most Philippine mining speculations\r\nwas chiefly due to the unwillingness of the native to co-operate with\r\nEuropean capitalists in search of quick fortunes for themselves. The\r\nnative rustic did not seek and would not submit to constant organized\r\nand methodical labour at a daily wage, to be paid periodically when\r\nhe had finished his work. The only class whom one could employ in the\r\nneighbourhood of the mines was migratory and half-subjected, whilst\r\nthere was no legislation whatever in force regulating the relations\r\nbetween workers and capitalists. Some suggested the employment of\r\nChinese, but the obstacles to this proposal have been pointed out\r\nin Chap. viii. It is very doubtful whether much profitable mining\r\nwill ever be done in this Colony without Chinese labour. Again, the\r\nwretched state of the public highways obliged the few enterprising\r\ncapitalists to spend their money on the construction of roads which\r\nhad already been paid for in taxes.\r\n\r\nIt is calculated that in the working of mines in the Philippines, as\r\nmuch as P1,300,000 was spent from the beginning of the last century\r\nup to 1876, without the least satisfactory result.\r\n\r\nA Spanish writer [157] asserts that on the coasts of Taal and Bauan,\r\nin the Province of Batangas, there were many traces of old gold-mines,\r\nand remarks: \"We are already scared in this enlightened century at\r\nthe number who have spent their silver and their health in excavating\r\nmines in the Philippines, only to undeceive themselves, and find\r\ntheir miserable greed punished.\"\r\n\r\nStill Gold-seeking continues, and the hope of many an American to-day\r\nis centred in the possibility of finding the smile of fortune in the\r\nBenguet and other districts now being scoured by prospectors.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIron-mines, situated a few miles from Manila, were worked about\r\nthe middle of the 18th century by Government, but the result being\r\ndisastrous, a concession of working rights was put up to public\r\nauction, and adjudicated to a certain Francisco Salgado, who engaged\r\nto pay annually to the State P20,500 in gold and 125 tons of iron. The\r\nconcern was an entire failure, chiefly owing to the usual transport\r\ndifficulty. Salgado afterwards discovered an iron mine in a place\r\ncalled Santa Ines, near Bosoboso, in the district of Morong, and\r\nobtained a concession to work it. The ore is said to have yielded 75\r\nper cent. of pure metal. The greatest obstacle which Salgado had to\r\ncontend with was the indolence of the natives, but eventually this\r\nwas overcome by employing Chinese in their stead. All went well for a\r\ntime, until the success which attended the undertaking awoke envy in\r\nthe capital. Salgado found it desirable to erect his smelting-furnaces\r\non the banks of the Bosoboso River to obtain a good water supply. For\r\nthis a special permission had to be solicited of the Gov.-General,\r\nso the opportunity was taken to induce this authority to put a stop\r\nto the whole concern on the ground that the Chinese workmen were\r\nnot Christians! Salgado was ordered to send these Chinese to the\r\nAlcayceria in Binondo (Manila), and ship them thence to China at his\r\nown expense. Moreover, on the pretext that the iron supplied to the\r\nRoyal Stores had been worked by infidels, the Government refused\r\nto pay for the deliveries, and Salgado became a ruined victim of\r\nreligious fanaticism.\r\n\r\nThe old parish priest of Angat, in Bulacan Province, once gave me\r\nthe whole history of the rich iron-mines existing a few miles from\r\nthat town. It appears that at about the beginning of last century,\r\ntwo Englishmen made vain efforts to work these mines. They erected\r\nexpensive machinery (which has since disappeared piece by piece),\r\nand engaged all the headmen around, at fixed salaries, to perform\r\nthe simple duty of guaranteeing a certain number of men each to work\r\nthere daily. The headmen were very smart at receiving their pay,\r\nsome of them having the audacity to ask for it in advance; yet the\r\nnumber of miners diminished, little by little, and no reasonable terms\r\ncould induce them to resume work. The priest related that, after the\r\nEnglishmen had spent a fortune of about L40,000, and seeing no result,\r\nin despair they hired a canoe, telling the native in charge to paddle\r\nout to sea, where they blew their brains out with pistols.\r\n\r\nAfterwards a Spaniard, who had made money during years of office as\r\nChief Judge and Governor of the Bulacan Province, thought he could,\r\nby virtue of the influence of his late position, command the services\r\nof all the labourers he might require to work the mine. It was a vain\r\nhope; he lost all his savings, and became so reduced in circumstances\r\nthat for a long time he was a pauper, accepting charity in the parish\r\nconvents of the province.\r\n\r\nThe Angat iron-mines undoubtedly yield a very rich ore--it is stated up\r\nto 85 per cent. of metal. Up to the Revolution they were still worked\r\non a small scale. In 1885, at the foot of these ferruginous hills, I\r\nsaw a rough kind of smelting-furnace and foundry in a dilapidated shed,\r\nwhere the points of ploughshares were being made. These were delivered\r\nat a fixed minimum price to a Chinaman who went to Binondo (Manila) to\r\nsell them to the Chinese ironmongers. In Malolos (Bulacan) I met one of\r\nthe partners in this little business--a Spanish half-caste--who told me\r\nthat it paid well in proportion to the trifling outlay of capital. If\r\nthe natives chose to bring in mineral they were paid for it; when\r\nthey did not come, the works and expenses were temporarily stopped.\r\n\r\nIn Baliuag, a few miles from Angat, where I have stayed a score\r\nof times, I observed, at the threshold of several houses, slabs of\r\niron about 8 feet long by 2 feet wide and 5 inches thick. I inquired\r\nabout the origin of this novelty, and several respectable natives,\r\nwhom I had known for years, could only inform me that their elders\r\nhad told them about the foreigners who worked the Angat mines, and\r\nthat the iron in question came from there. Appearing to belong to no\r\none in particular, the slabs had been appropriated.\r\n\r\nCopper is extracted in small quantities by both the wild tribes of\r\nthe North and the Mahometans of the South, who manufacture utensils\r\nof this metal for their own use. In the North, half-worked copper\r\nis obtained from the Igorrotes, but the attempt of a company--the\r\n_Compania Cantabro-Filipina_, established in the middle of last\r\ncentury--to exploit the copper deposits in Mancayan, in the district\r\nof Lepanto, has hardly been more successful than all other mining\r\nspeculations undertaken on a large scale in this Colony.\r\n\r\nMarble exists in large beds in the Province of Bataan, which is the\r\nwest-coast boundary of Manila Bay, and also in the Island of Romblon,\r\nbut, under the circumstances explained, no one cared to risk capital\r\nin opening quarries. In 1888 surface (boulder) marble was being cut\r\nnear Montalban (Rizal) under contract with the Dominican friars to\r\nsupply them with it for their church in Manila. It was of a motley\r\nwhitish colour, polished well, and a sample of it sent by me to a\r\nmarble-importer in London was reported on favourably.\r\n\r\nGranite is not found in these Islands, and there is a general want\r\nof hard stone for building purposes. Some is procurable at Angono,\r\nup the Lake of Bay, and it is from here that the stone was brought\r\nby the Spaniards for the Manila Port Works. Granite is brought over\r\nfrom Hong-Kong when needed for works of any importance, such as the\r\nnew Government House in Manila City, in course of construction when\r\nthe Spaniards evacuated the Islands. For ordinary building operations\r\nthere is a material--a kind of marl-stone called _Adobe_--so soft\r\nwhen quarried that it can be cut out in small blocks with a hand-saw,\r\nbut it hardens considerably on exposure to the air.\r\n\r\nGypsum deposits occur in a small island opposite to the town of\r\nCulasi (Antique) on the west coast of Panay, called Marilisan. The\r\nsuperincumbent marl has been removed in several places where regular\r\nworkings were carried on for years by natives, and shiploads of it\r\nwere sent to Manila until the Spanish Government prohibited its free\r\nextraction and export.\r\n\r\nSulphur exists in many islands, sometimes pure, in unlimited\r\nquantities, and often mixed with copper, iron, and arsenic. The\r\ncrater peak of the Taal Volcano in the Bombon Lake burst in 1749\r\n(_vide_ p. 18), and from that date, until the eruption of 1754,\r\nsulphur was extracted by the natives. These deposits were again\r\nworked in 1780, and during a few years following. Bowring states\r\n[158] that a well-known naturalist once offered a good sum of money\r\nfor the monopoly of working the sulphur mines in the Taal district.\r\n\r\nMineral oil was discovered some 12 years ago in the mountains of Cebu\r\nIsland, a few miles from the west-coast town of Toledo. A drill-boring\r\nwas made, and I was shown a sample of the crude _Oil_. An Irishman was\r\nthen conducting the experimental works. Subsequently a British engineer\r\nvisited the place, and reported favourably on the prospects. In 1896\r\nI was again at the borings. Some small machinery had been erected for\r\nworking the drills. A Dutch mining engineer was in charge of the work,\r\nwhich was being financed by a small British syndicate; but so far\r\na continuous flow had not been obtained, and it was still doubtful\r\nwhether a well had been struck or not. The Dutchman was succeeded\r\nby an American, who, when the Spanish-American War was on the point\r\nof breaking out, had to quit the place, and the enterprise has since\r\nremained in suspense.\r\n\r\nThere is a tendency, in most new and unexplored countries, to\r\nsee visionary wealth in unpenetrated regions--to cast the eye of\r\nimagination into the forest depths and the bowels of the earth, and\r\nbecome fascinated with the belief that Nature has laid vast treasures\r\ntherein; and the veil of mystery constitutes a tradition until it is\r\nrent by scientific investigation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XX\r\n\r\nDomestic Live-stock--Ponies, Buffaloes, Etc.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Phillipine pony is not an indigenous animal. It is said to have\r\noriginated from the small Andalusian horse and the Chinese mare. I have\r\nridden more than 500 Philippine ponies, and, in general, I have found\r\nthem swift, strong, and elegant animals when well cared for. Geldings\r\nare rarely met with. Before the American occupation ponies ranged\r\nin value from P25 to P150 for a sound animal. Unfortunately,\r\nprices of everything have risen since 1898, and, moreover, a fatal\r\nhorse-disease, called \"surra,\" unknown in the Islands before that\r\nperiod, has considerably reduced the stock of ponies. Due to these\r\ncauses, ponies cost to-day about three times the former prices.\r\n\r\nThe importation of Spanish and Australian horses resulted in failure,\r\nbecause green grass (_zacate_)--the fodder of Philippine ponies--was\r\nnot the diet they had been accustomed to. Amateur enthusiasts\r\nconstantly urged the Spanish authorities to take measures for the\r\nimprovement of the breed, and in 1888 the acting Gov.-General Molto\r\nsent a commission to British India to purchase breeding-horses\r\nand mares. A number of fine animals was brought to Manila, but the\r\nsucceeding Gov.-General, Weyler, disapproved of the transaction, and\r\nthe stock was sold to the public. Two stallions and two mares fetched\r\ntogether P2,600, the prices of the others ranging about P700 each.\r\n\r\nPony-races took place at Santa Mesa (Manila) every spring. They\r\nwere organized by \"the Manila Jockey Club,\" usually patronized by\r\nthe Gov.-General of the day, and the great meet lasted three days,\r\nwhen prizes were awarded to the winners. Ponies which had won races\r\nin Manila fetched from P300 to P1,000. The new racecourse is at Pasay.\r\n\r\nIn Cebu also there were pony races every autumn on the racecourse\r\nfacing the _Cotta_ and the Government House.\r\n\r\nSince 1898 the American authorities have imported thousands of horses\r\nfrom the United States for the public service, and American dealers\r\nhave brought quantities of them from Australia and the United States\r\nfor private sale. All their fodder, however, has to be procured from\r\nAmerica in pressed bales, as they cannot thrive on the food of the\r\ncountry. It is thought, however, that a plant, called _Teosinte_,\r\nwhich is now being cultivated, will be suitable for horse-fodder when\r\nthe animals become thoroughly acclimatized.\r\n\r\nThe ordinary native has no notion of the proper treatment of ponies,\r\nhis idea being, generally, that this highly nervous animal can be\r\nmanaged by brute force and the infliction of heavy punishment. Sights,\r\nas painful as they are ridiculous, are often the result of this\r\nerror. Unfortunately, the lower-class native feels little attachment\r\nto any animal but the Buffalo, or _Carabao_, as it is called here,\r\nand the family pig.\r\n\r\nBuffaloes six years old are considered in the prime of life\r\nfor beginning work, and will continue at hard labour, when well\r\npastured and bathed, for another six years. At 12 years of age a\r\ncarefully worked buffalo will still serve for light labour for about\r\nfive years. It is an amphibious animal, and if left to itself it\r\nwould pass quite one-third of its life in water or mud, whilst it\r\nis indispensable to allow it to bathe every day. When grazing near\r\nflooded land it will roam into the water up to its neck and immerse\r\nits head for two minutes at a time, searching for vegetable food\r\nbelow the surface. Whilst undisturbed in the field it is usually\r\naccompanied by five or six white herons, which follow in its trail\r\nin perfect security and feed on the worms and insects brought to the\r\nsurface by its foot-prints. It seems also to enjoy the attentions of\r\na small black bird, which hops about on its back and head to cleanse\r\nits skin and ears of vermin. It is curious to watch this bird flying\r\ntowards the buffalo, which raises its head to receive it.\r\n\r\nThe rustic and the buffalo are familiar companions, and seem to\r\nunderstand each other perfectly well. There is a certain affinity\r\nbetween them in many ways. When a peasant is owner of the animal he\r\nworks, he treats it almost like one of the family. It is very powerful,\r\ndocile, slow in its movements, and easy to train. Many times I have\r\nseen a buffalo ridden and guided by a piece of split rattan attached\r\nto a rattan-ring in its nostril by a child three years of age. It\r\nknows the voices of the family to which it belongs, and will approach\r\nor stand still when called by any one of them. It is not of great\r\nendurance, and cannot support hard work in the sun for more than a\r\ncouple of hours without rest and bathing if water be near. Europeans\r\ncannot manage this animal, and very few attempt it; it requires the\r\npatience, the voice, and the peculiar movement of the native.\r\n\r\nAltogether the buffalo may be considered the most useful animal in\r\nthe Philippines. It serves for carting, ploughing, carrying loads\r\non its back, and almost all labour of the kind where great strength\r\nis required for a short time. A peasant possessed of a bowie-knife,\r\na buffalo, and good health, need not seek far to make an independent\r\nliving. I owe a certain gratitude to buffaloes, for more than once they\r\nhave pulled my carriage out of the mud in the provinces, where horses\r\ncould get along no farther. Finally, buffalo-meat is an acceptable\r\narticle of food when nothing better can be got; by natives it is\r\nmuch relished. Its flesh, like that of deer and oxen, is sometimes\r\ncut into thin slices and sun-dried, to make what is called in the\r\nPhilippines _Tapa_, in Cuba _Tasajo_, and in Spain _Cecina_.\r\n\r\nIn the Visayas Islands oxen are used as draught-animals as frequently\r\nas buffaloes,--sometimes even for carriages.\r\n\r\nWild buffaloes are met with, and, when young, they are easily\r\ntamed. Buffalo-hunting, as a sport, is a very dangerous diversion, and\r\nrarely indulged in, as death or victory must come to the infuriated\r\nbeast or the chaser. A good hunting-ground is Nueva Ecija, near the\r\nCaraballo de Baler Mountain.\r\n\r\nThe domesticated buffalo is subject to a bronchial disease called\r\n_garrotillo_; it rarely recovers from a serious sprain, and more\r\nrarely still from a broken leg. In 1887-88, an epidemic disease,\r\npreviously unknown, appeared among the cattle, and several thousands\r\nof them died. From the autopsy of some diseased buffaloes, it was\r\nseen that the inside had become converted into blood. Agriculturists\r\nsuffered great losses. In the poor neighbourhood of Antipolo alone,\r\n1,410 head of cattle died within four months, according to a report\r\nwhich the Governor of Morong showed to me. An old acquaintance of mine\r\nin Bulacan Province lost 85 per cent. of his live-stock in the season,\r\nwhilst the remainder were more or less affected.\r\n\r\nAs a consequence of the Revolution (1896-98) and the War of\r\nIndependence (1899-1901) the stock of buffaloes was considerably\r\nreduced, many thousands of these useful animals having been stolen\r\nfrom their owners by the belligerents, only to slay them or work them\r\nto death. When peace dawned again on the Colony, rinderpest commenced\r\nto make ravages in the buffalo herds, which are now reduced to a\r\nmere fraction of what they were in 1896. The consequences of these\r\nlosses in live-stock are referred to in Chap. xxxi. Before the wars,\r\na buffalo could be got for P10 in places, such as hemp districts,\r\nwhere ploughing is seldom necessary, whilst in the sugar-yielding\r\nIsland of Negros P30 was about the lowest price for an average trained\r\nanimal. The present value is from P125 to P250.\r\n\r\nIn all my travels in this Colony I have seen only five _Donkeys_,\r\nwhich were imported simply as curiosities.\r\n\r\nMules have been imported into the Islands by the American authorities\r\nfor the public service. If sold they would fetch about P300 each. They\r\nare the most satisfactory draught-animals ever introduced and, but\r\nfor the fear of the new disease \"surra,\" might take the place of\r\nbuffaloes in agriculture.\r\n\r\nSheep do not thrive in this climate. They are brought from Shanghai,\r\nand, as a rule, they languish and die in a few months. Oxen, goats,\r\ndogs, cats, pigs, monkeys, fowls, ducks, turkeys, and geese are\r\namong the ordinary domestic live-stock. Both the dogs and the cats\r\nare of very poor species, and the European breeds are eagerly sought\r\nfor. The better class of natives have learned to appreciate the higher\r\ninstincts of the European dog. Many Chinese dogs with long, straight\r\nhair, pointed nose, small eyes, and black tongues are brought over\r\nfrom Hong-Kong. All thoroughbred Philippine cats have a twist in\r\ntheir tails, and are not nearly so fine as the European race.\r\n\r\nNatives do not particularly relish mutton or goat's flesh, which\r\nthey say is heating to the blood. I have found stewed monkey very\r\ngood food, but the natives only eat it on very rare occasions,\r\nsolely as a cure for cutaneous diseases. No flesh, fish or poultry\r\nhas the same flavour here as in Europe; sometimes, indeed, the meat\r\nof native oxen sold in Manila has a repulsive taste when the animal\r\nhas been quickly fattened for the market on a particular herb, which\r\nit eats readily. Neither can it be procured so tender as in a cold\r\nclimate. If kept in an ice-chest it loses flavour; if hung up in\r\ncool air it becomes flabby and decomposes. However, the cold-storage\r\nestablished by the American authorities and private firms, since\r\n1898, has greatly contributed to improve the supply of tender meat,\r\nand meat shipments are regularly received from Australia and America.\r\n\r\nThe seas are teeming with fish, and there are swarms of sharks,\r\nwhose victims are numerous, whilst crocodiles are found in most of\r\nthe deep rivers and large swamps in uncultivated tracts. The _Taclobo_\r\nsea-shell is sometimes found weighing up to about 180 lbs. Fresh-water\r\nfish is almost flavourless and little appreciated.\r\n\r\nIn all the rice-paddy fields, small fish called _Dalag_ (_Ophiocephalus\r\nvagus_), are caught by the natives, for food, with cane nets, or\r\nrod and line, when the fields are flooded. Where this piscatorial\r\nphenomenon exists in the dry season no one has been able satisfactorily\r\nto explain.\r\n\r\nThe only beast of prey known in the Philippines is the wild cat,\r\nand the only wild animal to be feared is the buffalo.\r\n\r\nBoth the jungles and the villages abound with insects and reptilia,\r\nsuch as lizards, snakes, iguanas, frogs, and other batrachian species,\r\nland-crabs, centipedes [159], tarantulas, scorpions, huge spiders,\r\nhornets, common beetles, queen-beetles (_elator noctilucus_) and\r\nothers of the vaginopennous order, red ants (_formica smaragdina_),\r\netc. Ants are the most common nuisance, and food cannot be left on\r\nthe table a couple of hours without a hundred or so of them coming\r\nto feed. For this reason sideboards and food-cupboards are made\r\nwith legs to stand in basins of water. There are many species of\r\nants, from the size of a pin's head to half an inch long. On the\r\nforest-trees a bag of a thin whitish membrane, full of young ants,\r\nis sometimes seen hanging, and the traveller, for his own comfort,\r\nshould be careful not to disturb it.\r\n\r\nBoa-Constrictors are also found, but they are rare, and I have never\r\nseen one in freedom. They are the most harmless of all snakes in\r\nthe Philippines. Sometimes the Visayos keep them in their houses,\r\nin cages, as pets. Small _Pythons_ are common. The snakes most to\r\nbe dreaded are called by the natives _Alupong_ and _Daghong-palay_\r\n(Tagalog dialect). Their bite is fatal if not cauterized at once. The\r\nlatter is met with in the deep mud of rice-fields and amongst the tall\r\nrice-blades, hence its name. Stagnant waters are nearly everywhere\r\ninfested with _Leeches_. In the trees in dense forests there is also\r\na diminutive species of leech which jumps into one's eyes.\r\n\r\nIn the houses and huts in Manila, and in most low-lying places,\r\nmosquitoes are troublesome, but thanks to an inoffensive kind of\r\nlizard with a disproportionately big ugly head called the _chacon_,\r\nand the small house-newt, one is tolerably free from crawling\r\ninsects. _Newts_ are quite harmless to persons, and are rather\r\nencouraged than otherwise. If one attempts to catch a newt by its\r\ntail it shakes it off and runs away, leaving it behind. Rats and mice\r\nare numerous. There are myriads of cockroaches; but happily fleas,\r\nhouse-flies, and bugs are scarce. In the wet-season evenings the\r\ncroaking of frogs in the pools and swamps causes an incessant din.\r\n\r\nIn the dry-season evenings certain trees are illuminated by swarms\r\nof fire-flies, which assemble and flicker around the foliage as do\r\nmoths around the flame of a candle. The effect of their darting in\r\nand out like so many bright sparks between the branches is very pretty.\r\n\r\nThere are many very beautiful _Moths_ and _Butterflies_. In 1897 I\r\nbrought home about 300 specimens of Philippine butterflies for the\r\nHon. Walter Rothschild.\r\n\r\nThe _White Ant_ (_termes_), known here as _Anay_, is by far the\r\nmost formidable insect in its destructive powers. It is also common\r\nin China. Here it eats through most woods, but there are some rare\r\nexceptions, such as Molave, Ipil, Yacal, etc. If white ants earnestly\r\ntake possession of the woodwork of a building not constructed of\r\nthe finest timber, it is a hopeless case. I have seen deal-wood\r\npacking-cases, which have come from Europe, so eaten away that they\r\ncould not be lifted without falling to pieces. Merchants' warehouses\r\nhave had to be pulled down and rebuilt owing to the depredations of\r\nthis insect, as, even if the building itself were not in danger, no\r\none would care to risk the storage of goods inside. The destruction\r\ncaused by _anay_ is possibly exaggerated, but there is no doubt that\r\nmany traders have lost considerable sums through having had to realize,\r\nat any price, wares into which this insect had penetrated.\r\n\r\nBats are to be seen in this Colony, measuring up to 5 feet from\r\ntip to tip of their wings. They are caught for the value of their\r\nbeautiful soft skins, which generally find a sale to Europeans\r\nreturning home. Bat-shooting is a good pastime, and a novelty to\r\nEuropeans. Small Bats frequently fly into the houses in the evening.\r\n\r\nDeer and _Wild Boars_ are plentiful, and afford good sport to the\r\nhuntsman. In Morong district--in Negros Island--and in Rizal Province,\r\non and in the vicinity of the estate which I purchased--I have had\r\nsome good runs. Monkeys, too, abound in many of the forests. In all\r\nthe islands there is enjoyment awaiting the sportsman. Pheasants,\r\nsnipe, a dozen varieties of wild pigeons, woodcock, jungle-fowl\r\n(_gallus bankiva_), wild ducks, water-fowl, etc. are common, whilst\r\nthere are also turtle-doves, _calaos_ (_buceros hydrocorax_), hawks,\r\ncranes, herons, crows, parrots, cockatoos, kingfishers, parroquets,\r\nand many others peculiar to the Archipelago which I will leave to\r\nornithologists to describe. [160] One curious species of pigeon\r\n(_calanas nicobarina_) is called in Spanish _Paloma de punalada_\r\nbecause of the crimson feathers on its breast, which look exactly as if\r\nthey were blood-stained from a dagger-stab. [161] In 1898 I saw some\r\nspecimens of this pigeon in the Hamburg Zoological Gardens. There\r\nare several birds of gorgeous plumage, such as the _oropendolo_\r\n(Spanish name).\r\n\r\nIt is a curious fact that these Islands have no singing birds.\r\n\r\nThe _Locust Plague_ is one of the great risks the planter has to\r\nrun. In 1851 the Government imported some _Martins_ from China with\r\nthe hope of exterminating the locusts. When the birds arrived in\r\nthe port of Manila they were right royally received by a body of\r\ntroops. A band of music accompanied them with great ceremony to Santa\r\nMesa, where they were set at liberty, and the public were forbidden\r\nto destroy them under severe penalties. At that date there were\r\ncountless millions of locusts among the crops. These winged insects\r\n(Tagalog, _balang_) come in swarms of millions at a time, and how\r\nto exterminate them is a problem. I have seen a mass of locusts so\r\ndense that a row of large trees the other side of them could not be\r\ndistinguished. Sailing along the Antique coast one evening, I observed,\r\non the fertile shore, a large brown-coloured plateau. For the moment I\r\nthought it was a tract of land which had been cleared by fire, but on\r\nnearing it I noticed that myriads of locusts had settled on several\r\nfields. We put in quite close to them and I fired off a revolver,\r\nthe noise of which caused them to move off slowly in a cloud. When\r\nlocusts settle on cultivated lands, miles of crops are often ruined\r\nin a night by the foliage being consumed, and at daybreak only fields\r\nof stalks are to be seen. In the daytime, when the locusts are about\r\nto attack a planted field, the natives rush out with their tin cans,\r\nwhich serve as drums, bamboo clappers, red flags, etc., to scare\r\nthem off, whilst others light fires in open spaces with damp fuel to\r\nraise smoke. Another effective method adopted to drive them away is to\r\nfire off small mortars, such as the natives use at provincial feasts,\r\nas these insects are sensitive to the least noise.\r\n\r\nThe body of a locust is similar in appearance to a large\r\ngrasshopper. The females are of a dark brown colour, and the males of\r\na light reddish-brown. The female extends the extremity of her body\r\nin the form of an augur, with which she pierces the earth to the depth\r\nof an inch, there to deposit her eggs. In two or three weeks the eggs\r\nhatch. Every few days the females lay eggs, if allowed to settle. The\r\nnewly-born insects, having no wings until they are about ten days\r\nold, cannot be driven off, and in the meantime they make great havoc\r\namong the crops, where it is difficult to extinguish them. The method\r\nemployed to get rid of them is to place a barrier, such as sheets of\r\ncorrugated iron roofing, at one side of a field, dig a pit in front of\r\nthe barrier, and send a number of men to beat round the three sides\r\nof the field until the young locusts jump in heaps into the pit. I\r\nhave heard planters say that they have succeeded, in this way, in\r\ndestroying as much as 20 tons of locusts in one season. I do not know\r\nthe maximum distance that locusts can fly in one continuous journey,\r\nbut they have been known to travel as much as 60 miles across the\r\nsea. Millions of unwinged locusts (called _lucton_) have been seen\r\nfloating down river streams, whilst, however, the winged insect cannot\r\nresist the heavy rains which accompany a hurricane.\r\n\r\nIt is said that the food passes through the body of a locust as\r\nfast as it eats, and that its natural death is due either to want of\r\nnourishment, or to a small worm which forms in the body and consumes\r\nit. It is also supposed that the female dies after laying a certain\r\nnumber of eggs. Excepting the damage to vegetation, locusts are\r\nperfectly harmless insects, and native children catch them to play\r\nwith; also, when fried, they serve as food for the poorest classes--in\r\nfact, I was assured, on good authority, that in a certain village in\r\nTayabas Province, where the peasants considered locusts a dainty dish,\r\npayment was offered to the parish priest for him to say Mass and pray\r\nfor the continuance of the luxury. In former times, before there were\r\nso many agriculturists interested in their destruction, these insects\r\nhave been known to devastate the Colony during six consecutive years.\r\n\r\nIn the mud of stagnant waters, a kind of beetle, called in Visaya\r\ndialect _Tanga_, is found, and much relished as an article of food. In\r\nthe dry season, as much as fifty cents a dozen is paid for them in Molo\r\n(Yloilo) by well-to-do natives. Many other insects, highly repugnant\r\nto the European, are a _bonne bouche_ for the natives.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXI\r\n\r\nManila Under Spanish Rule\r\n\r\n\r\nManila, the capital of the Philippines, is situated on the Island of\r\nLuzon at the mouth and on the left (south) bank of the Pasig River,\r\nat N. lat. 14 deg. 36' by E. long. 120 deg. 52'. It is a fortified city,\r\nbeing encircled by bastioned and battlemented walls, which were\r\nbuilt in the time of Governor Gomez Perez Dasmarinas, about the\r\nyear 1590. It is said that the labour employed was Chinese. These\r\nwalls measure about two miles and a quarter long, and bore mounted\r\nold-fashioned cannon. The fortifications are of stone, and their solid\r\nconstruction may rank as a _chef d'oeuvre_ of the 16th century. The\r\nearthquake of 1880 caused an arch of one of the entrances to fall in,\r\nand elsewhere cracks are perceptible. These defects were never made\r\ngood. The city is surrounded by water--to the north the Pasig River,\r\nto the west the sea, and the moats all around. These moats are paved\r\nat the bottom, and sluices--perhaps not in good working order at the\r\npresent day--are provided for filling them with water from the river.\r\n\r\nThe demolition of the walls and moats was frequently debated by\r\ncommissions specially appointed from Spain--the last in October,\r\n1887. It is said that a commission once recommended the cleansing of\r\nthe moats, which were half full of mud, stagnant water, and vegetable\r\nputrid matter, but the authorities hesitated to disturb the deposit,\r\nfor fear of fetid odours producing fever or other endemic disease.\r\n\r\nThese city defences, although quite useless in modern warfare with\r\na foreign Power, as was proved in 1898, might any day have been\r\nserviceable as a refuge for Europeans in the event of a serious revolt\r\nof the natives or Chinese. The garrison consisted of one European\r\nand several native regiments.\r\n\r\nThere are eight drawbridge entrances to the Citadel [162] wherein\r\nwere some Government Offices, branch Post and Telegraph Offices,\r\nthe Custom-house (temporarily removed to Binondo since May 4, 1887,\r\nduring the construction of the new harbour), Colleges, Convents,\r\nMonasteries, a Prison, numerous Barracks, a Mint, a Military Hospital,\r\nan Academy of Arts, a University, a statue of Charles IV. situated\r\nin a pretty square, a fine Town Hall, a Meteorological Observatory,\r\nof which the director was a Jesuit priest, an Artillery Depot, a\r\nCathedral and 11 churches. [163] The little trade done in the city\r\nwas exclusively retail. In the month of April or May, 1603, a great\r\nfire destroyed one-third of the city, the property consumed being\r\nvalued at P1,000,000.\r\n\r\nManila City was a lifeless capital, with narrow streets all running at\r\nright angles with each other, of sombre, monastic aspect. It had no\r\npopular cafes, no opera-house or theatre; indeed absolutely no place\r\nof recreation. Only the numerous religious processions relieved the\r\nuniformity of city life. The whole (walled) city and its environments\r\nseem to have been built solely with a view to self-defence. Since\r\n1887 it had been somewhat embellished by gardens in the public squares.\r\n\r\nBesides the churches of the walled city, those of the suburbs are of\r\ngreat historical interest. In the Plaza de Santa Cruz is established\r\nthe _Monte de Piedad_, or Public Pawnshop--a fine building--erected\r\nunder the auspices of Archbishop Pedro Payo.\r\n\r\nThe great trading-centre is the Island of Binondo, on the right (north)\r\nbank of the Pasig River, where the foreign houses are established. On\r\nthe city side of the river, where there was little commerce and\r\nno export or import trade whatever, a harbour was in course of\r\nconstruction, without the least hope of its ever being completed by\r\nthe Spaniards. All the sea-wall visible of these works was carried\r\naway by a typhoon on September 29, 1890. To defray the cost of making\r\nthis harbour, a special duty (not included in the Budget) of one per\r\ncent. on exports, two per cent. on imports, 10 cents per ton on vessels\r\n(besides the usual tonnage dues of eight cents per register ton), and a\r\nfishing-craft tax were collected since June, 1880. For eighteen years'\r\ndues-collection of several millions of pesos only a scrap of sea-wall\r\nwas to be seen beyond the river in 1898, of no use to trade or to\r\nany one. In 1882 fourteen huge iron barges for the transport of stone\r\nfrom Angono for the harbour were constructed by an English engineer,\r\nMr. W. S. Richardson, under contract with the Port Works, for P82,000.\r\n\r\nThe Port of Manila was officially held to extend for 27 miles\r\nwestward from the mouth of the Pasig River. This tortuous river,\r\nabout 14 miles long, flows from the Laguna de Bay.\r\n\r\nThe anchorage of the port was in the bay, two to two and a half miles\r\nsouth-west from the red light at the river-entrance, in about six\r\nfathoms. There was no special locality reserved for warships.\r\n\r\nShips at the anchorage communicated with the shore by their own\r\nboats or steam-launch, and the loading and discharging of vessels was\r\nchiefly effected in the bay, one to three miles off the river mouth,\r\nby means of lighters called _cascoes_.\r\n\r\nManila Bay has a circumference of 120 nautical miles, and is far too\r\nlarge to afford adequate protection to ships. The country around it\r\nis flat in character and has really nothing attractive.\r\n\r\nOn October 20, 1882, a typhoon drove 11 ships and one steamer ashore\r\nfrom their anchorage, besides dismasting another and causing three\r\nmore to collide. When a typhoon is approaching vessels have to run\r\nto Cavite for shelter.\r\n\r\nThe entrance to the bay is divided into two passages by the small\r\nIsland of Corregidor, on which was a lighthouse showing a revolving\r\nbright light, visible 20 miles off. Here was also a signal-station,\r\ncommunicating by a semaphore with a telegraph station on the opposite\r\nLuzon coast, and thence by wire with Manila. North of Corregidor\r\nIsland is situated the once important harbour of Mariveles. [164]\r\n\r\nThe entrance to the Pasig River is between two moles, which run out\r\nwestward respectively from the citadel on the south bank and from the\r\nbusiness suburb of Binondo on the north bank. At the outer extremity\r\nof the northern mole was a lighthouse, showing a fixed red light,\r\nvisible eight miles.\r\n\r\nVessels drawing up to 13 feet could enter the river. In the middle of\r\n1887 a few electric lights were established along the quays from the\r\nriver mouth to the first bridge, and one light also on that bridge,\r\nso that steamers could enter the river after sunset if desired. The\r\nwharfage is wholly occupied by steamers and sailing-craft trading\r\nwithin the Archipelago. The tides are very irregular. The rise and\r\nfall at springs may be taken to be five feet.\r\n\r\nUp to 1887 ships needing repairs had to go to Hong-Kong, but in that\r\nyear a patent slip was established at Canacao Bay, near Cavite, seven\r\nmiles southward from the Manila Bay anchorage. The working capacity\r\nof the hydraulic hauling power of the slip was 2,000 tons.\r\n\r\nAt Cavite, close by Canacao, there was a Government Arsenal and a\r\nsmall slip, having a hauling power of about 500 tons.\r\n\r\nUp to the year 1893 the streets of Manila City and suburbs were\r\nbadly lighted--petroleum lamps, and sometimes cocoanut oil, being\r\nused. (The paving was perhaps more defective than the lighting.) In\r\n1892 an Electric Light Company was formed, with a share capital of\r\nP500,000 (P350,000 paid up) for illuminating the city and suburbs and\r\nprivate lighting. Under the contract with the Municipality the company\r\nreceived a grant of P60,000, and the concern was in full working order\r\nthe following year. The poorest working class of Manila--fishermen,\r\ncanoemen, day labourers, etc.--live principally in the ward of Tondo,\r\nwhere dwellings with thatched roofs were allowed to be constructed. In\r\nthe wet season the part of this ward nearest to the city was simply\r\na mass of pollution. The only drainage was a ditch cut around the\r\nmud-plots on which the huts were erected. Many of these huts had\r\npools of stagnant water under them for months, hence it was there\r\nthat the mortality from fever was at its maximum ratio in the dry\r\nseason when evaporation commenced. Half the shore side of Tondo\r\nhas been many times devastated by conflagrations and by hurricanes,\r\nlocally termed _baguios_.\r\n\r\nBinondo presents an aspect of great activity during the day. The import\r\nand export trade is still largely in the hands of British merchants,\r\nand the retail traffic is, to a great extent, monopolized by the\r\nChinese. Their tiny shops, grouped together in rows, form bazaars. At\r\neach counter sits a Chinaman, casting up accounts, with the ancient\r\n_abacus_ [165] still serving him for practical reckoning. Another\r\nis ready at the counter to strike the bargain, whilst a third crafty\r\nCelestial lounges about the entrance to tout for custom, with a margin\r\non his prices for haggling which is high or low according to whether\r\nthe intending purchaser be American, European, half-caste, or native.\r\n\r\nThere is hardly a street without Chinese dealers, but their principal\r\ncentre is the _Rosario_, whilst the finest American and European\r\nshops are to be found in the _Escolta_. [166]\r\n\r\nIn 1881 a great fire occurred in the _Escolta_, and since then\r\nthe class of property in that important thoroughfare has been much\r\nimproved. In October, 1885, a second serious fire took place in this\r\nstreet, and on the site of the ruins there now stands a fine block of\r\nbuildings formerly occupied by the Central Post Office and Telegraph\r\nStation, and a row of good shops in European style.\r\n\r\nDuring the working hours were to be seen hundreds of smart Chinese\r\ncoolies, half-naked, running in all directions with loads, or driving\r\ncarts, whilst the natives dreamily sauntered along the streets,\r\nfollowing their numerous occupations with enviable tranquillity. In the\r\ndoorways here and there were native women squatting on the flag-stones,\r\npicking lice from each other's heads, and serving a purchaser\r\nbetween-times with cigars, betel-nut, and food, when occasion offered.\r\n\r\nCertain small handicrafts are almost entirely taken up by the Chinese,\r\nsuch as boot-making, furniture-making, small smith's-work and\r\ncasting, tin-working, tanning, dyeing, etc., whilst the natives are\r\noccupied as silversmiths, engravers, saddlers, water-colour painters,\r\nfurniture-polishers, bookbinders, etc. A few years ago the apothecaries\r\nwere almost exclusively Germans; now the profession is shared with\r\nnatives, half-castes, and one British firm.\r\n\r\nThe thoroughfares were crowded with carriages during the whole day\r\ndrawn by pretty native ponies. The public conveyance regulations in\r\nSpanish times were excellent. The rates for hiring were very moderate,\r\nand were calculated by the time engaged. Incivility of drivers was\r\na thing almost unknown. Their patience was astonishing. They would,\r\nif required, wait for the fare for hours together in a drenching rain\r\nwithout a murmur. Having engaged a vehicle (in Manila or elsewhere)\r\nit is usual to guide the driver by calling out to him each turn he has\r\nto take. Thus, if he be required to go to the right--_mano_ (hand)\r\nis the word used; if to the left--_silla_ (saddle) is shouted. This\r\ncustom originated in the days before natives were intrusted to drive,\r\nwhen a postilion rode the left (saddle) pony, and guided his right\r\n(hand) animal with a short rein.\r\n\r\nThrough the city and suburbs ran lines of tramway with cars drawn\r\nby ponies, and (from October 20, 1888 until 1905) a steam tramway\r\noperated as far as Malabon.\r\n\r\nFortunately, Easter week brought two days of rest every year for\r\nthe ponies, namely, Holy Thursday and Good Friday. As in Spain also,\r\nwith certain exceptions, such as doctors, urgent Government service,\r\netc., vehicles were not permitted in the streets and highways on those\r\ndays. Soldiers passing through the streets on service carried their\r\nguns with the muzzles pointing to the ground. The church bells were\r\ntolled with muffled hammers; hence, the vibration of the metal being\r\nchecked, the peal sounded like the beating of so many tin cans. The\r\nshops were closed, and, so far as was practicable, every outward\r\nappearance of care for worldly concerns was extinguished, whilst it was\r\ncustomary for the large majority of the population--natives as well as\r\nEuropeans--who went through the streets to be attired in black. On Good\r\nFriday afternoon there was an imposing religious procession through\r\nthe city and suburbs. On the following Saturday morning (_Sabado de\r\nGloria_), there was a lively scene after the celebration of Mass. In a\r\nhundred portals and alleys, public and private vehicles were awaiting\r\nthe peal of the unmuffled church bells. The instant this was heard\r\nthere was a rush in all directions--the clanking of a thousand ponies'\r\nfeet; the rumbling sound of hundreds of carriages. The mingled shouts\r\nof the natives and the Chinese coolies showed with what bated anxiety\r\nand forced subjection material interest and the affairs of this life\r\nhad been held in check and made subservient to higher thoughts.\r\n\r\nAn official computation in the year 1885 stated the average number\r\nof vehicles which passed through the main street of the city (_Calle\r\nReal_) _per day_ to be 950; through the _Escolta_, the principal\r\nstreet of Binondo, 5,000; and across the bridge, connecting Binondo\r\nwith Manila City (where the river is 350 feet wide), 6,000.\r\n\r\nSir John Bowring, in the account of his short visit to Manila in 1858,\r\nsays he was informed on good authority that the average number of\r\nvehicles passing daily at that date through the _Escolta_ amounted to\r\n915; across the bridge, between Binondo and Manila, 1,256; so that\r\napparently in 27 years the number of vehicles in use had increased\r\nby about five to one.\r\n\r\nThe Pasig River is navigable by steam-launches and\r\nspecially-constructed steamers of light draught, which go up the whole\r\ndistance into the Laguna de Bay. The river is crossed at Manila and\r\nsuburbs by three bridges, the chief of which is the _Puente de Espana._\r\n[167]\r\n\r\nIn the suburbs there were four Theatres, in none of which a dramatic\r\ncompany of any note would consent to perform. In one (the _Teatro\r\nFilipino_) the performance could be partly seen from the street;\r\nanother (the _Teatro de Tondo_) was situated in a dirty thoroughfare\r\nin a low quarter; the third (the _Teatro del Principe_) usually gave\r\nan entertainment in dialect for the amusement of the natives; and the\r\nfourth (the _Teatro Zorrilla_), located in Tondo, was built to serve\r\nas theatre or circus without any regard to its acoustic properties;\r\nhence only one-third of the audience could hear the dialogue. There\r\nwas a permanent Spanish Comedy Company (on tour at times in Yloilo\r\nand Cebu), and occasionally a troupe of foreign strolling players,\r\na circus, a concert, or an Italian Opera Company came to Manila to\r\nentertain the public for a few weeks.\r\n\r\nIn 1880 there used to be a kind of tent-theatre, called the _Carrillo_\r\nwhere performances were given without any pretence to histrionic\r\nart or stage regulations. The scenes were highly ridiculous, and\r\nthe gravest spectator could not suppress laughter at the exaggerated\r\nattitudes and comic display of the native performers. The public had\r\nfull licence to call to the actors and criticize them in loud voices\r\n_seance tenante_--often to join in the choruses and make themselves\r\nquite at home during the whole spectacle. About a year afterwards\r\nthe _Carrillo_ was suppressed. The first Spaniards who systematically\r\ntaught the Filipinos European histrionics were Ramon Cubero and his\r\nwife, Elisea Raguer (both very popular in their day), whose daughter\r\nmarried the Philippine actor and dramatic author Jose Carvajal. The\r\nold-fashioned native play was the \"_Moro Moro_,\" which continued in\r\nfull vogue, in the provinces, up to the end of Spanish dominion. [168]\r\n\r\nIn the suburb of Paco there was a bull-ring, which did not generally\r\nattract the _elite_, as a bull-fight there was simply a burlesque\r\nupon this national sport as seen in Spain. I have witnessed a Manila\r\n_espada_ hang on to the tail of his victim, and a _banderillero_ meet\r\nthe rush of the bull with a vault over his head, amidst hoots from the\r\nshady class of audience who formed the _habitues_ of the Manila ring.\r\n\r\nThe Civil Governor of the Province had full arbitrary power to enforce\r\nthe regulations relating to public performances, but it was seldom he\r\nimposed a fine. The programme had to be sanctioned by authority before\r\nit was published, and it could neither be added to nor any part of\r\nit omitted, without special licence. The performance was given under\r\nthe censorship of the Corregidor or his delegate, whose duty it was\r\nto guard the interests of the public, and to see that the spectacle\r\ndid not outrage morality.\r\n\r\nThe ostensible purpose of every annual feast all over the Colony\r\nwas to render homage to the local patron Saint and give thanks for\r\nmercies received in the past year. Every town, village, and suburb\r\nwas supposed to be specially cared for by its patron Saint, and when\r\ncircumstances permitted it there was a religious procession, which\r\nwas intended to impress on the minds of the faithful the virtue of\r\nthe intercessors by ocular demonstration. Vast sums of money were\r\nexpended from time to time in adornment of the images, the adoration\r\nof which seemed to be tinctured with pantheistic feeling, as if these\r\nsymbols were part of the Divine essence.\r\n\r\nAmong the suburban feasts of Manila, that of Binondo was particularly\r\nstriking. It took place in the month of October. An imposing\r\nilluminated procession, headed by the clergy, guarded by troops, and\r\nfollowed up by hundreds of native men, women and children carrying\r\ncandles, promenaded the principal streets of the vicinity. But the\r\nreligious feeling of the truly devoted was shocked by one ridiculous\r\nfeature--the mob of native men, dressed in gowns and head-wreaths,\r\nin representation of the Jews who persecuted our Saviour, rushing\r\nabout the streets in tawdry attire before and after the ceremony in\r\nsuch apparent ignorance of the real intention that it annulled the\r\nsublimity of the whole function.\r\n\r\nAll Saints' Day--November 1--brought a large income to the priests in\r\nthe most frequented parish churches. This is one of the days on which\r\nsouls can be got out of Purgatory. The faithful flocked in mobs to the\r\npopular shrines, where an effort was made to place a lighted wax candle\r\nat the foot of the altar, and on bended knee to invoke the Saints' aid\r\non behalf of their departed relatives and friends. But the crowd was\r\nso great that the pious were not permitted this consolation for more\r\nthan two or three minutes. Sacristans made them move on, to leave room\r\nfor new-comers, and their candles were then extinguished and collected\r\nin heaps, Chinese infidel coolies being sometimes employed to carry\r\naway the spoil to the parish priest's store. The wax was afterwards\r\nsold to dealers. One church is said to have collected on November 1,\r\n1887, as much as 40 cwts., valued at P37 per cwt. This day was a\r\npublic holiday, and in the afternoon and evening it was the custom\r\nto visit the last resting-places, to leave a token of remembrance on\r\nthe tombs of the lamented.\r\n\r\nThe Asylum for Lepers, at Dalumbayan, in the ward of Santa Cruz, was\r\nalso visited the same day, and whilst many naturally went there to\r\nsee their afflicted relations and friends, others, of morbid tastes,\r\nsatisfied their curiosity. This Asylum, subsidized by Government\r\nto the extent of P500 per annum, was, in the time of the Spaniards,\r\nunder the care of Franciscan friars.\r\n\r\nIn January or February the Chinese celebrate their New Year, and\r\nsuspend work during a week or ten days. The authorities did not\r\npermit them to revel in fun to the extent they would have done in\r\ntheir own country; nevertheless, Chinese music, gongs, and crackers\r\nwere indulged in, in the quarters most thickly populated by this race.\r\n\r\nThe natives generally have an unbounded passion for cock-fighting,\r\nand in the year 1779 it occurred to the Government that a profitable\r\nrevenue might be derived from a tax on this sport. Thenceforth it\r\nwas only permitted under a long code of regulations on Sundays and\r\nfeast days, and in places officially designated for the \"meet\" of\r\nthe combatants. In Manila alone the permission to meet was extended\r\nto Thursdays. The cock-pit is called the _Gallera_, and the tax was\r\nfarmed out to the highest bidding contractor, who undertook to pay\r\na fixed annual sum to the Government, making the best he could for\r\nhimself out of the gross proceeds from entrance-fees and sub-letting\r\nrents in excess of that amount. In like manner the Government farmed\r\nout the taxes on horses, vehicles, sale of opium, slaughter of animals\r\nfor consumption, bridge-tolls, etc., and, until 1888, the market\r\ndues. Gambling licences also brought a good revenue, but it would\r\nhave been as impossible to suppress cock-fighting in the Islands as\r\ngambling in England. [169]\r\n\r\nThe Spanish laws relating to the cock-pit were very strict, and\r\nwere specially decreed on March 21,1861. It was enacted that the\r\nmaximum amount to be staked by one person on one contest should be 50\r\npesos. That each cock should wear only one metal spur. That the fight\r\nshould be held to be terminated on the death of one or both cocks,\r\nor when one of them retreated. However, the decree contained in all a\r\nhundred clauses too tedious to enumerate. Cock-fighting is discussed\r\namong the natives with the same enthusiasm as horse-racing is in\r\nEngland. The majority of sportsmen rear cocks for several years,\r\nbestowing upon them as much tender care as a mother would on her\r\ninfant. When the hope of the connoisseur has arrived at the age of\r\ndiscretion and valour, it is put forward in open combat, perhaps\r\nto perish in the first encounter. And the patient native goes on\r\ntraining others.\r\n\r\nWithin twenty minutes' drive from Manila, at Nagtajan, on the\r\nright bank of the Pasig River, there was a good European club (since\r\nremoved to Ermita), of which the members were chiefly English-speaking\r\nmerchants and employees. The entrance-fee was [Pesos]30; the monthly\r\nsubscription was [Pesos]5, and [Pesos]1 per month extra for the use\r\nof a fairly good library.\r\n\r\nThe principal hotel--the \"Hotel de Oriente\"--was opened in Binondo\r\nin January, 1889, in a large two-storeyed building, with 83 rooms\r\nfor the public service, and stabling for 25 horses. It was the\r\nfirst building specially erected in the Colony for an hotel. The\r\naccommodation and board were good. It ranked with the best hotels\r\nin the East. [In 1903 the building was purchased by the (American)\r\nInsular Government for public offices.] In Manila City and Binondo\r\nthere were several other Spanish hotels where the board was tolerable,\r\nbut the lodging and service abominable. There was a telephone system\r\nestablished throughout the city and its environs.\r\n\r\nThe press was represented by five dailies--_El Diario de Manila,\r\nLa Oceania Espanola_, three evening papers, _El Comercio, La Voz de\r\nEspana_, and (from March 3, 1889) _La Correspondencia de Manila_--also\r\na bi-weekly, _La Opinion_. Some good articles appeared at times\r\nin the three dailies first mentioned, but as newspapers strictly\r\nso-called, the information in all was remarkably scant, due to the\r\nstrict censorship exercised jointly by a priest and a layman. There\r\nwas also a purely official organ--the _Gaceta de Manila_.\r\n\r\nThe first news-sheet published in Manila appears to have been the\r\n_Filantropo_, in the year 1822, which existed only a few years. Others\r\nfollowed and failed in a short time. The first Manila daily paper was\r\nthe _Estrella_, which started in 1846 and lasted three years. Since\r\nthen several dailies have seen the light for a brief period. The\r\n_Diario de Manila_, started in 1848, was the oldest newspaper of\r\nthose existing at the end of the Spanish regime.\r\n\r\nIn Spain journalism began in the 17th century by the publication,\r\nat irregular intervals, of sheets called \"_Relaciones_.\" The first\r\nSpanish newspaper, correctly so called, was established in the 18th\r\ncentury. Seventy-eight years ago there was only one regular periodical\r\njournal in Madrid. After the Peninsula War, a step was made towards\r\npolitical journalism. This led to such an abuse of the pen that in\r\n1824 all, except the _Gaceta de Madrid_, the _Gaceta de Bayona_, the\r\n_Diario_, and a few non-political papers were suppressed. Madrid has\r\nnow scores of newspapers, of which half a dozen are very readable. The\r\n_Correspondencia de Espana_, founded by the late Marquis de Santa\r\nAna as a Montpensier organ, used to afford me great amusement in\r\nMadrid. It contained columns of most extraordinary events in short\r\nparagraphs (_gacetillas_), and became highly popular, hundreds of\r\npersons eagerly waiting to secure a copy. In a subsequent issue, a\r\nfew days later, many of the paragraphs in the same columns were merely\r\ncorrections of the statements previously published, but so ingeniously\r\ninterposed that the hoax took the public for a long time. Newspapers\r\nfrom Spain were not publicly exposed for sale in Manila; those which\r\nwere seen came from friends or by private subscription, whilst many\r\nwere proscribed as inculcating ideas dangerously liberal.\r\n\r\nThere was a botanical garden, rather neglected, although it cost the\r\nColony about P8,600 per annum. The stock of specimens was scanty,\r\nand the grounds were deserted by the general public. It was at least\r\nuseful in one sense--that bouquets were supplied at once to purchasers\r\nat cheap rates, from 25 cents and upwards.\r\n\r\nIn the environs of Manila there are several pleasant drives and\r\npromenades, the most popular one being the _Luneta_, where a military\r\nband frequently played after sunset. The Gov.-General's palace [170]\r\nand the residences of the foreign European population and well-to-do\r\nnatives and Spaniards were in the suburbs of the city outside the\r\ncommercial quarter. Some of these private villas were extremely\r\nattractive, and commodiously designed for the climate, but little\r\nattention was paid until quite the latter days to architectural beauty.\r\n\r\nVery few of the best private residences have more than one storey\r\nabove the ground-floor. The ground-floor is either uninhabited or\r\nused for lodging the native servants, or as a coach-house, on account\r\nof the damp. From the vestibule main entrance (_zaguan_) one passes\r\nto the upper floor, which constitutes the house proper, where the\r\nfamily resides. It is usually divided into a spacious hall (_caida_),\r\nleading from the staircase to the dining and reception-rooms; on\r\none or two sides of these apartments are the dormitories and other\r\nprivate rooms. The kitchen is often a separate building, connected\r\nwith the house by a roofed passage; and by the side of the kitchen,\r\non the same level, is a yard called the _azotea_--here the bath-room\r\nis erected. The most modern houses have corrugated-iron roofs. The\r\nground-floor exterior walls are of stone or brick, and the whole of the\r\nupper storey is of wood, with sliding windows all around. Instead of\r\nglass, opaque oyster-shells (Tagalog, _capis_) are employed to admit\r\nthe light whilst obstructing the sun's rays. Formerly the walls up to\r\nthe roof were of stone, but since the last great earthquake of 1880\r\nthe use of wood from the first storey upwards has been rigorously\r\nenforced in the capital and suburbs for public safety. Iron roofs\r\nare very hot, and there are still some few comfortable, spacious,\r\nand cool suburban residences with tile roof or with the primitive\r\ncogon-grass or nipa palm-leaf thatching, very conducive to comfort\r\nalthough more liable to catch fire.\r\n\r\nIn Spanish times there were no white burglars, and the main entrance\r\nof a dwelling-house was invariably left open until the family\r\nretired for the night. Mosquitoes abound in Manila, coming from the\r\nnumerous malarious creeks which traverse the wards, and few persons\r\ncan sleep without a curtain. To be at one's ease, a daily bath is\r\nindispensable. The heat from 12 to 4 p.m. is oppressive from March\r\nto May, and most persons who have no afternoon occupation, sleep the\r\n_siesta_ from 1 to 3 o'clock. The conventional lunch-hour all over\r\nthe Colony is noon precisely, and dinner at about 8 o'clock. The\r\nvisiting hours are from 5 to 7 in the evening, and _reunions_ and\r\nmusical _soirees_ from 9. Society was far less divided here than\r\nin the British-Asiatic Colonies. There was not the same rigid line\r\ndrawn as in British India between the official, non-official, and\r\nnative. Spaniards of the best families in the capital endeavoured,\r\nwith varying success, to europeanize the people of the country, and\r\nmany of them exchanged visits with half-breeds, and at times with\r\nwealthy pure natives. Spanish hospitality in the Philippines was far\r\nmore marked than in Europe, and educated foreigners were generally\r\nreceived with great courtesy.\r\n\r\nSince the year 1884 the city and suburbs are well supplied with\r\ngood drinking-water, which is one of the most praiseworthy modern\r\nimprovements undertaken by the Spanish Government. To provide for\r\nthis beneficial work, a Spanish philanthropist, named Carriedo--a\r\nlate commander of an Acapulco galleon--left a sum of money in the\r\n18th century, in order that the capital and accumulated interest might\r\none day defray the expense. The water supply (brought from Santolan,\r\nnear Mariquina), being more than sufficient for general requirements,\r\nthe city and suburbs were, little by little, adorned with several\r\npublic fountains. Although Manila lies low the climate is healthy,\r\nand during several years of personal observation I found the average\r\nmaximum and minimum temperature at noon in the shade to be 98 deg. and 75 deg.\r\nFahr. respectively. The climate of Manila may be generally summed up as\r\nfollows, viz.:--December, January, and February, a delightful spring;\r\nMarch, April, and May, an oppressive heat; June, July, August, and\r\nSeptember, heavy rains and more tolerable heat; October and November,\r\ndoubtful--sometimes very wet, sometimes fairly dry. Briefly, as to\r\nclimate, it is a pleasant place to reside in.\r\n\r\nIn 1593 Manila already had a coat-of-arms, with the title of \"_Muy\r\nInsigne y siempre leal Ciudad_\" and in the beginning of the 17th\r\ncentury King Philip III. conferred upon it the title of \"_La muy noble\r\nCiudad _\"; hence it was lately styled \"_La muy noble y siempre leal\r\nCiudad_\" (the very noble and always loyal city).\r\n\r\nAccording to Gironniere, [171] the civilized population of this Colony\r\nin 1845 was as follows, namely:--\r\n\r\n\r\n    Europeans (including 500 Friars)                4,050\r\n    Spanish-native half-breeds                      8,584\r\n    Spanish-native-Chinese half-breeds.           180,000\r\n    Chinese                                         9,901\r\n    Pure natives                                3,304,742\r\n\r\n    Total civilized population                  3,507,277\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the last Spanish census, taken in 1876, the total number of\r\ninhabitants, including Europeans and Chinese, was shown to be a little\r\nunder 6,200,000, but a fixed figure cannot be relied upon because it\r\nwas impossible to estimate exactly the number of unsubdued savages\r\nand mountaineers, who paid no taxes. The increase of native population\r\nwas rated at about two per cent, per annum, except in the Negrito or\r\nAeta tribes, which are known to be decreasing.\r\n\r\nIn Manila City and wards it is calculated there were in 1896 about\r\n340,000 inhabitants, of which the ratio of classes was approximately\r\nthe following, namely:--\r\n\r\n                                            Per cent.\r\n        Pure natives                            68.00\r\n        Chinese half-breeds                     16.65\r\n        Chinese                                 12.25\r\n        Spaniards and Creoles                    1.65\r\n        Spanish half-breeds                      1.30\r\n        Foreigners (other than Chinese)          0.15\r\n\r\n                                               100.00\r\n\r\n\r\nThe walled city alone contained a population of about 16,000 souls.\r\n\r\nTyphoons affect Manila more or less severely about once a year,\r\nnearly always between April and middle of December, and sometimes\r\ncause immense destruction to property. Roofs of houses are carried\r\naway; the wooden upper-storey frontages are blown out; ships are torn\r\nfrom their moorings; small craft laden with merchandise are wrecked,\r\nand the inhabitants flee from the streets to make fast their premises,\r\nand await in intense anxiety the conclusion of the tempest. A hurricane\r\nof this description desolated Manila in October, 1882, and, at the same\r\ntime, the wind was accompanied by torrents of rain, which did great\r\ndamage to the interiors of the residences, warehouses, and offices. A\r\nsmall house, entirely made of wood, was blown completely over, and the\r\nnatives who had taken refuge on the ground-floor were left, without a\r\nmoment's notice, with the sky for a roof. Two Chinamen, who thought to\r\ntake advantage of the occasion and economically possess themselves of\r\ngalvanized-iron roofing, had their heads nearly severed by sheets of\r\nthis material flying through the air, and their dead bodies were picked\r\nup in the _Rosario_ the next morning. I was busy with the servants\r\nall that day in my house, in the unsuccessful attempt to fasten the\r\nwindows and doors. Part of the kitchen was carried away; water came\r\nin everywhere; and I had to wait patiently, with an umbrella over me,\r\nuntil the storm ceased. The last similarly destructive hurricane,\r\naffecting Manila, occurred on September 26, 1905.\r\n\r\nManila is also in constant danger of destruction from earthquakes. The\r\nmost serious one within the last century occurred in June,\r\n1863. The shock lasted half a minute, and the falling _debris_ of\r\nthe upheaved buildings caused 400 deaths, whilst 2,000 persons were\r\nwounded. The total loss of property on that occasion was estimated at\r\nP 8,000,000. Official returns show that 46 public edifices were thrown\r\ndown; 28 were nearly destroyed; 570 private buildings were wrecked,\r\nand 528 were almost demolished. Simultaneously, an earthquake occurred\r\nin Cavite--the port and arsenal south-west of Manila--destroying\r\nseveral public buildings. In 1898 many of the ruins caused by this\r\nearthquake were still left undisturbed within the City of Manila. In\r\n1863 the best buildings had heavy tiled roofs, and many continued so,\r\nin spite of the severe lesson, until after the shock of 1880, when\r\ngalvanized corrugated iron came into general use for roofing, and,\r\nin fact, no one in Manila or Binondo now builds a house without it.\r\n\r\nIn 1880 no lives were lost, but the damage to house property was\r\nconsiderable. The only person who suffered physically from this\r\ncalamity was an Englishman, Mr. Parker, whose arm was so severely\r\ninjured that it was found necessary to amputate it.\r\n\r\nPrior to 1863 the most serious earthquakes recorded happened in\r\nNovember, 1610; November, 1645; August, 1658; in 1675; in 1699; in\r\n1796, and in 1852. Consequent on the shock of 1645, all the public\r\nbuildings were destroyed excepting one monastery and two churches,\r\nsome 600 persons were killed, and the Gov.-General was extricated\r\nfrom the ruins of his palace.\r\n\r\n [172]According to the Jesuit Father Faura, Director of the Manila\r\n Observatory, the following slight quakes occurred in 1881, viz.:--3\r\n in July, 7 in August, 10 in September, and 3 in October. Earth-tremors\r\n almost imperceptible are so frequent in these Islands that one hardly\r\n heeds them after a few months' residence.\r\n\r\nIn a cosmopolitan city like Manila--the temporary home of so\r\nmany different races--it was interesting to observe the varied\r\nwearing-apparel in vogue. The majority of the Spaniards wore the\r\nEuropean costume; the British generally dressed in white drill, with\r\nthe coat buttoned up to the neck, and finished off with a narrow\r\ncollar of the same material. The Chinese always preserved their own\r\npeculiar national dress--the most rational of all--with the pig-tail\r\ncoiled into a chignon. The pure natives and many half-breeds wore\r\nthe shirt outside the trousers. It was usually white, with a long\r\nstiff front, and cut European fashion; but often it was made of\r\nan extremely fine yellow-tinted expensive material, called _pina_\r\n(_vide_ p. 283). Some few of the native _jeunesse doree_ of Manila\r\ndonned the European dress, much to their apparent discomfort. The\r\nofficial attire of the headman of a Manila ward and his subordinates\r\nwas a shirt with the tail outside the trousers, like other natives\r\nor half-breeds, but over which was worn the official distinction of\r\na short Eton jacket, reaching to the hips. All this is now changing,\r\nwith a tendency to imitate the Americans.\r\n\r\nA native woman wore, as she does now, a flowing skirt of gay\r\ncolours--bright red, green, and white being the common choice. The\r\nlength of train, and whether the garment be of cotton, silk, or\r\nsatin, depends on her means. Corsets are not yet the fashion, but a\r\nchemisette, which just covers her breast, and a starched neckcloth\r\n(_panuelo_) of _pina_ or _husi_ stuff are in common use. The _panuelo_\r\nis square, and, being folded triangularly, it hangs in a point down the\r\nback and stands very high up at the neck, in the 17th century style,\r\nwhilst the other two points are brooched where they meet at the top of\r\nthe chemisette _decolletee_. To this chemisette are added immensely\r\nwide short sleeves. Her hair is brushed back from the forehead,\r\nwithout a parting, and coiled into a tight, flat chignon. In her\r\nhand she carries a fan, without which she would feel lost. Native\r\nwomen have an extravagant desire to possess jewellery--even if they\r\nnever wear it. The head is covered with a white mantle of very thin\r\nmaterial, sometimes figured, but more often this and the neckcloth\r\nare embroidered--a work in which they excel. Finally, her naked\r\nfeet are partly enveloped in _chinelas_--a kind of slipper, flat,\r\nlike a shoe-sole with no heel, but just enough upper in front to put\r\nfour toes inside. Altogether, the appearance of a Philippine woman of\r\nwell-to-do family dressed on a gala day is curious, sometimes pretty,\r\nbut, in any case, admirably suited to the climate.\r\n\r\nSince 1898 American example, the great demand for _pina_ muslin, at\r\nany price, by American ladies, and the scarcity of this texture, due\r\nto the plants having been abandoned during the wars, have necessarily\r\nbrought about certain modifications in female attire.\r\n\r\nThere is something very picturesque in the simple costume of a peasant\r\nwoman going to market. She has no flowing gown, but a short skirt,\r\nenveloped in a _tapis_, generally of cotton. It is simply a rectangular\r\npiece of stuff; as a rule, all blue, red, or black. It is tucked in\r\nat the waist, drawn very tightly around the loins, and hangs over\r\nthe skirt a little below the knees, the open edges being at the back.\r\n\r\nAt times the better class wear the more becoming short skirt and\r\n_tapis_ of silk or satin, with gold-lace embroidered _chinelas_. This\r\ndress is elegant, and adds a charm to the wearer.\r\n\r\nThe _tapi_ is smaller. It is not used in the street; it is a sort\r\nof _neglige_ apparel worn in the house only, or for going to the\r\nbath. The poorest classes go to the river-side to bathe in it. It is\r\ndrawn all around from the waist downwards.\r\n\r\nThe _patadiong_ is more commonly worn by the Visaya than the northern\r\nwoman. It is somewhat like the _tapis_, but is drawn round the waist\r\nfrom the back, the open edges meeting, more or less, at the front. In\r\nLuzon Island the old women generally prefer this to the _tapis_.\r\n\r\nOn feast days and special occasions, or for dances, the young women\r\nwho can afford it sport the gaudy flowing gown of bright particoloured\r\nstriped silk or satin, known as the _saya suelta_, with the train\r\ncut in a peculiar fashion unknown in Europe.\r\n\r\nThe figure of a peasant woman is erect and stately, due to her habit\r\nfrom infancy of carrying jars of water, baskets of orchard produce,\r\netc., on her head with a pad of coiled cloth. The characteristic\r\nbearing of both sexes, when walking, consists in swinging the arms\r\n(but more often the right arm only) to and fro far more rapidly than\r\nthe stride, so that it gives them the appearance of paddling.\r\n\r\nA \"first class\" Manila funeral, before the American advent, was\r\na whimsical display of pompous ignorance worth seeing once. There\r\nwas a hideous bier with rude relics of barbarism in the shape of\r\npaltry adornments. A native driver, with a tall \"chimney pot\" hat,\r\nfull of salaried mournfulness, drove the white team. The bier was\r\nheaded by a band of music playing a lively march, and followed by\r\na line of carriages containing the relations and friends of the\r\ndeceased. The burial was almost invariably within twenty-four hours\r\nof the decease--sometimes within six hours.\r\n\r\nThere is nothing in Manila which instantly impresses one as strikingly\r\nnational, whether it be in artistic handicraft, music, painting,\r\nsculpture, or even diversions. The peculiar traditional customs of\r\nan Eastern people--their native dress, their characteristic habits,\r\nconstitute--by their originality and variation, the only charm to\r\nthe ordinary European traveller. The Manila middle-class native,\r\nin particular, possesses none of this. He is but a vivid contrast\r\nto his vivacious Spanish model, a striking departure from his own\r\npicturesque aboriginal state, and an unsuccessful imitator of the\r\ngrace and easy manners of his Western tutor. In short, he is neither\r\none thing nor the other in its true representation compared with the\r\ngenial, genuine, and natural type to be found in the provinces.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMany years' residence in Manila, or in any one particular locality of\r\nthe Archipelago, will not enable either the alien or the native to form\r\na just opinion of the physical, social, or economic conditions of the\r\nColony; they can only be understood after extensive travelling through\r\nand around the Islands. Nor will three or four tours suffice for the\r\nintelligent inquirer, because first impressions often lead to false\r\nconclusions; information obtained through one source must needs be\r\nverified by another; the danger of mistaking isolated cases for general\r\nrules has to be avoided, and, lastly, the native does not reveal to the\r\nfirst-time traveller the intricacies of Philippine life. Furthermore,\r\nthe traveller in any official capacity is necessarily the least\r\ninformed person concerning the real thought and aspirations of the\r\nFilipino or true Philippine life; his position debars him from the\r\nopportunity of investigating these things.\r\n\r\nIt would be beyond the scope of this work to take the reader mentally\r\nthrough the thousand or more miles of lovely scenery, and into the\r\nhomes of the unsophisticated classes who still preserve, unalloyed,\r\nmany of their natural characteristics and customs. But within half a\r\nday's journey from the capital there are many places of historical\r\ninterest, among which, on account of its revived popularity since\r\nthe American advent, may be mentioned Los Banos, on the south shore\r\nof the Laguna de Bay.\r\n\r\nLos Banos (the baths) owes its origin to the hot springs flowing from\r\nthe volcanic Maquiling Mountain, which have been known to the natives\r\nfrom time immemorial when the place was called Maynit, which signifies\r\n\"hot.\"\r\n\r\nAt the close of the 16th century these mineral waters attracted the\r\nattention of Martyr Saint Pedro Bautista (_vide_ p. 64), who sent\r\na brother of his Order to establish a hospital for the natives. The\r\nbrother went there, but shortly returned to Manila and died. So the\r\nmatter remained in abeyance for years. Subsequently a certain Fray\r\nDiego de Santa Maria, an expert in medicine and the healing art, was\r\nsent there to test the waters. He found they contained properties\r\nhighly beneficial in curing rheumatism and certain other maladies,\r\nso thenceforth many natives and Spaniards went there to seek bodily\r\nrelief. But there was no convenient abode for the visitors; no\r\narrangements for taking the baths, and the Government did nothing. A\r\nFranciscan friar was appointed chaplain to the sick visitors, but\r\nhis very incommodious residence was inadequate for the lodging of\r\npatients, and, for want of funds, the priest abandoned the project\r\nof establishing a hospital, and returned to Manila. In 1604 the\r\nGov.-General, Pedro Bravo de Acuna, gave his attention to this\r\nplace, and consented to the establishment of a hospital, church,\r\nand convent. The hospital was constructed of bamboo and other light\r\nmaterial, and dedicated to Our Lady of Holy Waters.\r\n\r\nFray Diego de Santa Maria was appointed to the vicarage and the charge\r\nof the hospital. The whole was supported by gifts from the many sick\r\npersons who went there, but the greatest difficulty was to procure\r\nfood. Several natives made donations of lands, with the produce of\r\nwhich the hospital was to be maintained. These gifts, however, proved\r\ninsufficient. The priests then solicited permission from the villagers\r\nof Pila (on the lake shore near Santa Cruz) to pasture cattle on the\r\ntongue of land on the opposite coast called Jalajala, which belonged\r\nto them. With their consent a cattle-ranche was established there;\r\nsubsequently, a building was erected, and the place was in time known\r\nas the _Estancia de Jalajala_. Then the permission was asked for and\r\nobtained from the Pila natives to plant cocoanut palms, fruit-trees,\r\nand vegetables. Later on the Austin and Franciscan friars quarrelled\r\nabout the right of dominion over the place and district called Maynit,\r\nbut eventually the former gave way and ceded their alleged rights in\r\nperpetuity to the Franciscans.\r\n\r\nIn 1640 Los Banos (formerly a dependency of Bay, under the Austin\r\nfriars) was constituted a \"town.\" The Franciscans continued to\r\nbeg one concession after another, until at length, in 1671, stone\r\nbuildings were commenced--a church, convent, hospital, bathing-pond,\r\nvapour-house, etc., being constructed. Natives and Europeans flocked in\r\nnumbers to these baths, and it is said that people even came from India\r\nto be cured. The property lent and belonging to the establishment,\r\nthe accumulated funds, and the live-stock had all increased so much in\r\nvalue that the Government appointed an administrator. Thenceforth the\r\nplace declined; its popularity vanished; the administrator managed\r\nmatters so particularly for his own benefit that food again became\r\nscarce, and the priest was paid only 10 pesos per month as salary. In\r\nJalajala a large house was built; the land was put under regular\r\ncultivation; tenants were admitted; but when the property was declared\r\na royal demesne the Pila inhabitants protested, and nominally regained\r\npossession of the lent property. But the administrator re-opened\r\nand contested the question in the law-courts, and, pending these\r\nproceedings, Jalajala was rented from the Government. During this\r\nlong process of legal entanglements the property had several times\r\nbeen transferred to one and another until the last holder regarded\r\nit as his private estate.\r\n\r\nAt the beginning of last century Jalajala came into the possession of\r\nM. Paul de la Gironniere, from whom it passed to another Frenchman,\r\nat whose death a third Frenchman, M. Jules Daillard, became owner. On\r\nhis decease it became the property of an English Bank, from whom it was\r\npurchased by the Franciscan friars, in 1897, for the sum of P.50,000,\r\nand re-sold by them to a Belgian firm in 1900.\r\n\r\nThe bathing establishment was gradually falling into decay, until\r\nits complete ruin was brought about by a fire, which left only the\r\nremnant of walls. The priest continued there as nominal chaplain\r\nwith his salary of 10 pesos per month and an allowance of rice. The\r\nestablishment was not restored until the Government of Domingo\r\nMoriones (1877-80). A vapour bath-house and residence were built,\r\nbut the hospital was left unfinished, and it was rotting away from\r\nneglect when the Spaniards evacuated the Islands.\r\n\r\nThe portion of the Hospital of Los Banos which remained intact, and\r\nthe house attached thereto, which the natives called \"the palace,\"\r\nserved to accommodate invalids who went to take the cure. These baths\r\nshould only be taken in the dry season--December to May.\r\n\r\nBesides the convent and church the town simply consisted of a row of\r\ndingy bungalows on either side of the highroad, with a group of the\r\nsame on the mountain side. Since the American advent the place has\r\nbeen much improved and extended.\r\n\r\nOn his way from Manila to Los Banos the traveller will pass (on\r\nthe left bank of the Pasig River) the ruins of _Guadalupe Church_,\r\nwhich mark the site of a great massacre of Chinese during their\r\nrevolt in 1603 (_vide_ p. 114). The following legend of this once\r\nbeautiful and popular church was given to me by the Recoleto friars\r\nat the convent of the Church of La Soledad, in Cavite:--During the\r\nconstruction of the world-famed _Escorial_, by order of Philip II.,\r\nthe architect's nephew, who was employed by his uncle on the work,\r\nkilled a man. The King pardoned him on condition that he be banished\r\nto the Philippines. He therefore came to Manila, took holy orders,\r\nand designed and superintended the building of Guadalupe Church,\r\nfrom the scaffolding of which he fell, and having been caught by the\r\nneck in a rope suspended from the timbers he was hanged.\r\n\r\nDuring the wars of the Rebellion and Independence this ancient building\r\nwas destroyed, only the shot-riddled and battered outer walls remaining\r\nin 1905.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXII\r\n\r\nThe Tagalog Rebellion of 1896-98\r\nFirst Period\r\n\r\n\r\nAfter the Napoleonic wars in Spain, the \"Junta Suprema Central\r\ndel Reino\" convened the famous \"Cortes de Cadiz\" by decree dated\r\nSeptember 12, 1809. This _junta_ was succeeded by another--\"El\r\nSupremo Consejo de la Regencia\"--when the _Cortes_ passed the first\r\nSuffrage Bill known in Spain on January 29, 1810. These _Cortes_\r\nassembled deputies from all the Colonies--Cuba, Venezuela, Chile,\r\nGuatemala, Santa Fe, Puerto Rico, the Philippines, etc.; in fact,\r\nall those dependencies which constituted the four Viceroyalties and\r\nthe eight Captain-Generalships of the day. The Philippine deputy,\r\nVentura de los Reyes, signed the Act of Constitution of 1812. In 1820\r\nthe _Cortes_ again admitted this Colony's representatives, amongst\r\nwhom were Vicente Posadas, Eulalio Ramirez, Anselmo Jorge Fajardos,\r\nRoberto Pimental, Esteban Marques, Jose Florentino, Manuel Saez\r\nde Vismanos, Jose Azcarraga, and nine others. They also took part\r\nin the parliamentary debates of 1822 and 1823. The Constitution was\r\nshortly afterwards suspended, but on the demise of Ferdinand VII. the\r\nPhilippine deputies, Brigadier Garcia Gamba and the half-breed Juan\r\nFrancisco Lecaros, sat in Parliament. Again, and for the last time,\r\nPhilippine members figured in the _Cortes_ of the Isabella II. Regency;\r\nthen, on the opening of Parliament in 1837, their exclusion, as well as\r\nthe government of the Ultramarine Provinces by special laws, was voted.\r\n\r\nThe friars, hitherto regarded by the majority of Filipinos as their\r\nprotectors and friendly intermediaries between the people and the civil\r\nrulers, had set their faces against the above radical innovations,\r\nforeseeing in them a death-blow to their own preponderance. Indeed,\r\nthe \"friar question\" only came into existence after the year 1812.\r\n\r\nIn 1868 Queen Isabella II. was deposed, and the succeeding Provisional\r\nGovernment (1868-70), founded on Republican principles, caused an\r\nAssembly of Reformists to be established in Manila. The members of\r\nthis _Junta General de Reformas_ were five Filipinos, namely, Ramon\r\nCalderon, Bonifacio Saez de Vismanos, Lorenzo Calvo, Gabriel Gonzalez\r\nEsquibel, and Joaquin Pardo de Tavera; eleven civilian Spaniards,\r\nnamely, Joaquin J. Inchausti, Tomas Balbas y Castro, Felino Gil,\r\nAntonio Ayala, with seven others and five Spanish friars, namely,\r\nFather Fonseca, Father Domingo Trecera, Rector of the University,\r\n(Dominicans), one Austin, one Recoleto and one Franciscan friar. This\r\n_junta_ had the power to vote reforms for the Colony, subject to the\r\nratification of the Home Government. But monastic influence prevailed;\r\nthe reforms voted were never carried into effect, and long before\r\nthe Bourbon restoration took place (1874) the Philippine Assembly had\r\nceased to exist. But it was impossible for the mother country, which\r\nhad spontaneously given the Filipinos a taste of political equality,\r\nagain to yoke them to the old tutelage without demur. Alternate\r\npolitical progress and retrogression in the Peninsula cast their reflex\r\non this Colony, but the first sparks of liberty had been gratuitously\r\nstruck which neither reaction in the Peninsula nor persecution in the\r\nColony itself could totally extinguish. No Filipino, at that period,\r\ndreamed of absolute independence, but the few who had been taught by\r\ntheir masters to hope for equal laws, agitated for their promulgation\r\nand became a thorn in the side of the Monastic Orders. Only as their\r\neyes were spontaneously opened to liberty by the Spaniards themselves\r\ndid they feel the want of it.\r\n\r\nThe Cavite Rising of 1872 (_vide_ p. 106), which the Philippine\r\nGovernment unwisely treated as an important political movement and\r\nmercilessly avenged itself by executions and banishment of many of the\r\nbest Manila families, was neither forgotten nor forgiven. To me, as a\r\nforeigner, scores of representative provincial natives did not hesitate\r\nto open their hearts in private on the subject. The Government lost\r\nconsiderably by its uncalled-for severity on this occasion. The natives\r\nregarded it as a sign of apprehension, and a proof of the intention\r\nto rule with an iron rod. The Government played into the hands of\r\nthe Spanish clergy, and all the friars gained by strengthening their\r\nmonopoly of the incumbencies they lost in moral prestige. Thinking men\r\nreally pitied the Government, which became more and more the instrument\r\nof the ecclesiastics. Since then, serious ideas of a revolution to be\r\naccomplished one day took root in the minds of influential Filipinos\r\nthroughout the provinces adjacent to Manila. _La Solidaridad_, a\r\nPhilippine organ, founded in Madrid by Marcelo Hilario del Pilar,\r\nMariano Ponce, Eduardo Leyte and Antonio Luna for the furtherance of\r\nPhilippine interests was proscribed, but copies entered the Islands\r\nclandestinely. In the villages, secret societies were formed which the\r\npriests chose to call \"Freemasonry\"; and on the ground that all vows\r\nwhich could not be explained at the confessional were anti-christian,\r\nthe Archbishop gave strict injunctions to the friars to ferret out\r\nthe so-called Freemasons. Denunciations by hundreds quickly followed,\r\nfor the priests willingly availed themselves of this licence to get rid\r\nof anti-clericals and others who had displeased them. In the town of\r\nMalolos (which in 1898 became the seat of the Revolutionary Congress)\r\nFather Moises Santos caused all the members of the Town Council to\r\nbe banished, and when I last dined with him in his convent, he told\r\nme he had cleared out a few more and had his eye on others. From\r\nother villages, notably in the provinces around the capital, the\r\npriests had their victims escorted up to Manila and consigned to\r\nthe Gov.-General, who issued the deportation orders without trial\r\nor sentence, the recommendation of the all-powerful _padre_ being\r\nsufficient warrant. Thus hundreds of families were deprived of fathers\r\nand brothers without warning or apparent justification;--but it takes\r\na great deal to rouse the patient native to action. Then in 1895 came\r\nthe Marahui campaign in Mindanao (_vide_ p. 144). In order to people\r\nthe territory around Lake Lanao, conquered from the _Moros_, it was\r\nproposed to invite families to migrate there from the other islands,\r\nand notifications to this effect were issued to all the provincial\r\ngovernors. At first it was put to the people in the smooth form of a\r\nproposal. None volunteered to go, because they could not see why they\r\nshould give up what they had to go and waste their lives on a tract\r\nof virgin soil with the very likely chance of a daily attack from the\r\n_Moros_. Peremptory orders followed, requiring the governors to send up\r\n\"emigrants\" for the Yligan district. This caused a great commotion in\r\nthe provinces, and large numbers of natives abandoned their homes to\r\nevade anticipated violence. I have no proof as to who originated this\r\nscheme, but there is the significant fact that the _orders_ were issued\r\nonly to the authorities of those provinces supposed to be affected by\r\nthe secret societies. Under the then existing system, the governors\r\ncould not act in a case like this without the co-operation of the\r\nparish priests; hence during the years 1895 and 1896 a systematic\r\ncourse of official sacerdotal tyranny was initiated which, being\r\ntoo much even for the patient Filipino, was the immediate cause of\r\nthe members of the _Katipunan_ secret society hastening their plans\r\nfor open rebellion, the plot of which was prematurely discovered on\r\nThursday, August 20, 1896. The rebellion in Cuba was calling for all\r\nthe resources in men and material that Spain could send there. The\r\ntotal number of European troops dispersed over these Islands did\r\nnot exceed 1,500 well armed and well officered, of which about 700\r\nwere in Manila. The native auxiliaries amounted to about 6,000. The\r\nimpression was gaining ground that the Spaniards would be beaten\r\nout of Cuba; but whilst this idea gave the Tagalogs moral courage to\r\nattempt the same in these Islands, so far as one could then foresee,\r\nSpain's reverse in the Antilles and the consequent evacuation would\r\nhave permitted her to pour troops into Manila, causing the natives'\r\nlast chance to vanish indefinitely.\r\n\r\nSeveral months before the outbreak, the _Katipunan_ sent a deputation\r\nto Japan to present a petition to the Mikado, praying him to annex\r\nthe Philippines. This petition, said to have been signed by 5,000\r\nFilipinos, was received by the Japanese Government, who forwarded\r\nit to the Spanish Government; hence the names of 5,000 disaffected\r\npersons were known to the Philippine authorities, who did not find\r\nit politic to raise the storm by immediate arrests.\r\n\r\nThe so-called \"Freemasonry\" which had so long puzzled and irritated\r\nthe friars, turned out, therefore, to be the _Katipunan_, which simply\r\nmeans the \"League.\" [173] The leaguers, on being sworn in, accepted the\r\n\"blood compact\" (vide p. 28), taking from an incision on the leg or arm\r\nthe blood with which to inscribe the roll of fraternity. The cicatrice\r\nserved also as a mark of mutual recognition, so that the object and\r\nplans of the leaguers should never be discussed with others. The drama\r\nwas to have opened with a general slaughter of Spaniards on the night\r\nof August 20, but, just in the nick of time, a woman sought confession\r\nof Father Mariano Gil (formerly parish priest of Bigaa, Bulacan),\r\nthen the parish priest of Tondo, a suburb of Manila, and opened the\r\nway for a leaguer, whose heart had failed him, to disclose the plot on\r\ncondition of receiving full pardon. With this promise he made a clean\r\nbreast of everything, and without an hour's delay the civil guard\r\nwas on the track of the alleged prime movers. Three hundred supposed\r\ndisaffected persons were seized in Manila and the Provinces of Pampanga\r\nand Bulacan within a few hours, and, large numbers being brought\r\nin daily, the prisons were soon crowded to excess. The implacable\r\nArchbishop Bernardino Nozaleda advocated extermination by fire and\r\nsword and wholesale executions. Gov.-General Ramon Blanco hesitated to\r\ntake the offensive, pending the arrival of reinforcements which were\r\ncalled for. He informed the Home Government that the rising was of no\r\ngreat importance, but that he required 1,000 more troops to be sent\r\nat once. The reply from Madrid was that they were sending 2,000 men,\r\n2,000,000 cartridges, 6,000 Remington rifles, and the gunboats _Isla\r\nde Cuba_ and _Isla de Luzon_. Each steamer brought a contingent of\r\ntroops, so that General Blanco had a total of about 10,000 Spanish\r\nregulars by the end of November. Spain's best men had been drafted\r\noff to Cuba, and these were chiefly raw levies who had all to learn\r\nin the art of warfare.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, the rebellion had assumed alarming proportions. Among the\r\nfirst to be seized were many of the richest and most prominent men in\r\nthe Colony--the cream of Manila society. There was intense excitement\r\nin the capital as their names gradually leaked out, for many of them\r\nwere well known to us personally or by repute. No one who possessed\r\nwealth was safe. An opulent Chinese half-caste, Don Pedro P. Rojas,\r\nwho was popularly spoken of as the prime supporter of the rebellion,\r\nwas a guest at Government House two days before the hour fixed for\r\nthe general slaughter. It cost him a fortune to be allowed to leave\r\nthe Islands. He took his passage for Europe in the _Isla de Panay_,\r\ntogether with Dr. Rizal, but very prudently left that steamer at\r\nSingapore and went on in the French mail to Marseilles and thence to\r\nParis, where he was still residing in 1905. No _documentary_ evidence\r\ncould be produced against him, and on June 1, 1897, the well-known\r\npolitician, Romero Robledo, undertook his defence in the _Cortes_, in\r\nMadrid, in a brilliant speech which had no effect on his parliamentary\r\ncolleagues. For the Spaniards, indeed, the personal character of Pedro\r\nP. Rojas was a matter of no moment. The Manila court-martial, out of\r\nwhose jurisdiction Rojas had escaped, held his estates, covering over\r\n70,000 acres, under embargo, caused his numerous steam cane-mills to be\r\nsmashed, and his beautiful estate-house to be burnt, whilst his 14,000\r\nhead of cattle disappeared. Subsequently the military court exonerated\r\nPedro P. Rojas in a decree which stated \"that all those persons who\r\nmade accusations against him have unreservedly retracted them, and that\r\nthey were only extracted from such persons by the tortures employed by\r\nthe Spanish officials; that the supposed introduction of arms into the\r\nColony through an estate owned by Pedro P. Rojas is purely fantastical,\r\nand that the only arms possessed by the rebels were those taken by them\r\nin combat from the Spanish soldiers.\" [174] But his second cousin,\r\nFrancisco L. Rojas, a shipowner, contrabandist, and merchant, was\r\nnot so fortunate. He was also one of the first seized, and his trial\r\nwas pending until General Blanco left the Islands. During this period\r\nRojas' wife besought the General to release him, but he could not do\r\nso without incurring public censure, in view of the real or fictitious\r\ncondemnatory evidence brought against him by the court-martial. The\r\nchief accusation was that of importing arms for the rebellion. It\r\neven became a current topic, for a few weeks, that some German\r\nmerchants had made a contract with Rojas to sell him the arms, but\r\nthe Spanish authorities had sufficient good sense, on this occasion,\r\nnot to be guided by public outcry. When General Polavieja arrived,\r\nFrancisco L. Rojas' fate became a certainty, and he was executed as a\r\ntraitor. The departure of Pedro P. Rojas and the serenity of General\r\nBlanco aroused great indignation among the civilian Spaniards who\r\nclamoured for active measures. A week passed before it was apparent\r\nto the public that he had taken any military action. Meanwhile, he\r\nwas urged in vain by his advisers to proclaim martial law. The press\r\ncensor would not allow the newspapers to allude to the conspirators as\r\n\"rebels,\" but as \"brigands\" (_tulisanes_). The authorities were anxious\r\nto stifle the notion of rebellion, and to treat the whole movement\r\nas a marauding affair. On August 23 the leading newspaper published\r\na patriotic appeal to the Spaniards to go _en masse_ the next day to\r\nthe Gov.-General to concert measures for public safety. They closed\r\ntheir shops and offices, and assembled before Government House; but\r\nthe General refused to receive them, and ordered the newspaper to pay\r\na fine of P500, which sum was at once raised in the streets and cafes.\r\n\r\nOn August 26, 1,000 rebels made a raid on Coloocan, four miles outside\r\nthe capital. They killed a few Chinese, and seized others to place them\r\nin the van of their fighting men. The armed crowd was kept at bay by a\r\nposse of civil guards, until they learnt that a cavalry reinforcement\r\nwas on the way from Manila. Then the rebels, under cover of darkness,\r\nfled towards the river, and were lost sight of. The next morning I\r\nwatched the troopers cross over the _Puente de Espana_. There was\r\nmud up to the ponies' bellies, for they had scoured the district all\r\naround. The hubbub was tremendous among the habitual saunterers on\r\nthe _Escolta_--the Rialto of Manila. For the next few days every\r\nSpaniard one met had some startling news to tell, until, by the\r\nend of the week, a reaction set in, and amidst jokes and _copitas_\r\nof spirits, the idea that the Coloocan affair was the prelude to a\r\nrebellion was utterly ridiculed. The Gov.-General still refused to\r\nproclaim martial law, considering such a grave measure unnecessary,\r\nwhen suddenly the whole city was filled with amazement by the news\r\nof a far more serious attack near Manila.\r\n\r\nAbout 4 a.m. on Sunday, August 30, the rebels concentrated at the\r\nvillage of San Juan del Monte, distant half an hour on horseback from\r\nthe city gates. They endeavoured to seize the powder magazine. One\r\nSpanish artilleryman was killed and several of the defenders were badly\r\nwounded whilst engaged in dropping ammunition from window openings into\r\na stream which runs close by. Cavalry and infantry reinforcements were\r\nat once sent out, and the first battle was fought at the entrance to\r\nthe village of San Juan del Monte. The rebels made a hard stand this\r\ntime under the leadership of Sancho Valenzuela (a hemp-rope maker in\r\na fairly good way of business), but he showed no military skill and\r\nchiefly directed his men by frantic shouts from the window of a wooden\r\nhouse. Naturally, as soon as they had to retreat, Valenzuela and his\r\nthree companions were taken prisoners. The rebels left about 80 dead\r\non the field and fled towards the Pasig River, which they tried to\r\ncross. Their passage was at first cut off by gunboats, which fired\r\nvolleys into the retreating mob and drove them higher up the bank,\r\nwhere there was some hand-to-hand fighting. Over a hundred managed\r\nto get into canoes with the hope of reaching the Lake of Bay; but,\r\nas they passed up the river, the civil guard, lying in ambush on\r\nthe opposite shore, fired upon them, and in the consequent confusion\r\nevery canoe was upset. The loss to the rebels in the river and on the\r\nbank was reckoned at about 50. The whole of that day the road to San\r\nJuan del Monte was occupied by troops, and no civilian was allowed\r\nto pass. At 3 p.m. the same day martial law was proclaimed in Manila\r\nand seven other Luzon provinces.\r\n\r\nThe next morning at sunrise I rode out to the battlefield with the\r\ncorrespondent of the _Ejercito Espanol_ (Madrid). The rebel slain had\r\nnot yet been removed. We came across them everywhere--in the fields and\r\nin the gutters of the highroad. Old men and youths had joined in the\r\nscrimmage and, with one exception, every corpse we saw was attired in\r\nthe usual working dress. This one exception we found literally upside\r\ndown with his head stuck in the mud of a paddy-field. Our attention\r\nwas drawn to him (and possibly the Spaniards' bullets, too) by his\r\nbright red baggy zouave trousers. We rode into the village, which\r\nwas absolutely deserted by its native inhabitants, and stopped at\r\nthe estate-house of the friars where the Spanish officers lodged. The\r\n_padre_ looked extremely anxious, and the officers advised us not to\r\ngo the road we intended, as rebel parties were known to be lurking\r\nthere. The military advice being practically a command, we took the\r\nhighroad to Sampaloc on our way back to the city.\r\n\r\nIn the meantime the city drawbridges, which had probably not been\r\nraised since 1852 (_vide_ p. 343, footnote), were put into working\r\norder--the bushes which had been left to flourish around the approaches\r\nwere cut down, and the Spanish civilians were called upon to form\r\nvolunteer cavalry and infantry corps. So far the rebel leaders had\r\nissued no proclamation. It was not generally known what their aims\r\nwere--whether they sought independence, reforms, extermination of\r\nSpaniards or Europeans generally. The attitude of the thoroughbred\r\nnative non-combatants was glum silence born of fear. The half-castes,\r\nwho had long vaunted their superior birth to the native, found\r\nthemselves between two stools. If the natives were going to succeed\r\nin the battle, they (the half-castes) would want to be the peaceful\r\nwire-pullers after the storm. On the other hand, they had so long\r\nstriven to be regarded as on a social equality with the Spaniards\r\nthat they could not now abstain from espousing their cause against the\r\nrebels without exciting suspicion. Therefore, in the course of a few\r\ndays, the half-castes resident in the capital came forward to enlist\r\nas volunteers. But no one imagined, at that time, how widespread was\r\nthe _Katipunan_ league. To the profound surprise of the Spaniards it\r\nwas discovered, later on, that many of the half-caste volunteers were\r\nrebels in disguise, bearing the \"blood compact\" mark, and presumably\r\nonly waiting to see which way the chances of war would turn to join\r\nthe winning side.\r\n\r\nUnder sentence of the court-martial established on August 30, the\r\nfour rebel leaders in the battle of San Juan del Monte were executed\r\non September 4, on the Campo de Bagumbayan, facing the fashionable\r\nLuneta Esplanade, by the seashore. Three sides of a square were\r\nformed by 1,500 Spanish and half-caste volunteers and 500 regular\r\ntroops. Escorted by two Austin and two Franciscan friars, the condemned\r\nmen walked to the execution-ground from the chapel within the walled\r\ncity, where they had been confined since the sentence was passed. They\r\nwere perfectly self-composed. They arrived on the ground pinioned;\r\ntheir sentence was read to them and Valenzuela was unpinioned for\r\na minute to sign some document at a table. When he was again tied\r\nup, all four were made to kneel on the ground in a row facing the\r\nopen sea-beach side of the square. Then amidst profound silence, an\r\nofficer, at the head of 16 Spanish soldiers, walked round the three\r\nsides of the square, halting at each corner to pronounce publicly\r\nthe formula--\"In the name of the King! Whosoever shall raise his\r\nvoice to crave clemency for the condemned shall suffer death.\" The 16\r\nsoldiers filed off in fours and stood about five yards behind each\r\nculprit. As the officer lowered his sword the volley was fired, and\r\nall but Valenzuela sank down and rolled over dead. It was the most\r\nimpressive sight I had witnessed for years. The bullets, which had\r\npassed clean through Valenzuela's body, threw up the gravel in front\r\nof him. He remained kneeling erect half a minute, and then gradually\r\nsank on his side. He was still alive, and four more shots, fired close\r\nto his head, scattered his brains over the grass. Conveyances were\r\nin readiness to carry off the corpses, and the spectators quitted\r\nthe mournful scene in silence. This was the first execution, which\r\nwas followed by four others in Manila and one in Cavite in General\r\nBlanco's time, and scores more subsequently.\r\n\r\nUp the river the rebels were increasing daily, and at Pasig a thousand\r\nof them threatened the civil guard, compelling that small force and the\r\nparish priest to take refuge in the belfry tower. On the river-island\r\nof Pandacan, just opposite to the European Club at Nagtajan, a crowd\r\nof armed natives, about 400 strong, attacked the village, sacked the\r\nchurch, and drove the parish priest up the belfry tower. In this plight\r\nthe _padre_ was seen to wave a handkerchief, and so drew the attention\r\nof the guards stationed higher up the river. Aid was sent to him at\r\nonce; the insurgents were repulsed with great loss, but one European\r\nsergeant was killed, and several native soldiers wounded. The rebellion\r\nhad spread to the northern province of Nueva Ecija, where the Governor\r\nand all the Europeans who fled to the Government House in San Isidro\r\nwere besieged for a day (September 8) and only saved from capture\r\nby the timely arrival from Manila of 500 troops, who outflanked the\r\ninsurgents and dispersed them with great slaughter. In Bulacan the\r\nflying column under Major Lopez Arteaga had a score of combats with\r\nthe rebels, who were everywhere routed. Spaniards and creoles were\r\nmaltreated wherever they were found. A young creole named Chofre,\r\nwell known in Manila, went out to Mariquina to take photographic views\r\nwith a foreign half-caste friend of his named Augustus Morris. When\r\nthey saw the rebels they ran into a hut, which was set fire to. Morris\r\n(who was not distinguishable as a foreigner) tried to escape and was\r\nshot, whilst Chofre was burnt to death. From Maragondon a Spanish lady\r\nwas brought to Manila raving mad. At 23, _Calle Cabildo_ (Manila),\r\nthe house of a friend of mine, I several times saw a Spanish lady\r\nwho had lost her reason in Mariquina, an hour's drive from Manila.\r\n\r\nCrowds of peaceful natives swarmed into the walled city from the\r\nsuburbs. The Gov.-General himself abandoned his riverside residence\r\nat Malacanan, and came with his staff to _Calle Potenciana_. During\r\nthe first four months quite 5,000 Chinese, besides a large number\r\nof Spanish and half-caste families, fled to Hong-Kong. The passport\r\nsystem was revived; that is to say, no one could leave Manila for the\r\nother islands or abroad without presenting himself personally at the\r\nCivil Governor's office to have his _cedula personal_ vised.\r\n\r\nThe seditious tendency of a certain Andres Bonifacio, a warehouse-man\r\nin the employ of a commercial firm in Manila, having come to the\r\nknowledge of the Spaniards, he was prematurely constrained to seek\r\nsafety in Cavite Province which, thenceforth, became the most important\r\ncentre of the rebellion. Simultaneously Emilio Aguinaldo [175] rallied\r\nhis fighting-men, and for a short while these two organizers operated\r\nconjointly, Bonifacio being nominally the supreme chief. From the\r\nbeginning, however, there was discord between the two leaders as to\r\nthe plan of campaign to be adopted. Bonifacio advocated barbarous\r\npersecution and extermination of the Europeans, whilst Aguinaldo\r\ninsisted that he was fighting for a cause for which he sought the\r\nsympathy and moral support of friends of liberty all the world over and\r\nthat this could never be obtained if they conducted themselves like\r\nsavages. Consequent on this disagreement as to the _modus operandi_,\r\nBonifacio and Aguinaldo became rivals, each seeking the suppression\r\nof the other. Aguinaldo himself explains [176] that Bonifacio\r\nhaving condemned him to death, he retaliated in like manner, and the\r\ncontending factions met at Naig. Leaving his armed followers outside,\r\nAguinaldo alone entered the house where Bonifacio was surrounded by\r\nhis counsellors, for he simply wished to have an understanding with\r\nhis rival. Bonifacio, however, so abusively confirmed his intention\r\nto cut short Aguinaldo's career that the latter withdrew, and ordered\r\nhis men to seize Bonifacio, who was forthwith executed, by Aguinaldo's\r\norder, for the prosperity of the cause and the good of his country.\r\n\r\nBonifacio's followers were few, and, from this moment, Emilio\r\nAguinaldo gradually rose from obscurity to prominence. Born at Cauit\r\n[177] (Cavite) on March 22, 1869, of poor parents, he started life\r\nin the service of the incumbent of San Francisco de Malabon. Later\r\non he went to Manila, where, through the influence of a relative,\r\nemployed in a humble capacity in the capital, he was admitted\r\ninto the College of San Juan de Letran under the auspices of the\r\nDominican friars. Subsequently he became a schoolmaster at Silan\r\n(Cavite), and at the age of twenty-six years he was again in his\r\nnative town as petty-governor (Municipal Captain). He is a man\r\nof small frame with slightly webbed eyes, betraying the Chinese\r\nblood in his veins, and a protruding lower lip and prominent chin\r\nindicative of resolve. Towards me his manner was remarkably placid\r\nand unassuming, and his whole bearing denoted the very antithesis of\r\nthe dashing warrior. Throughout his career he has shown himself to be\r\npossessed of natural politeness, and ever ready with the soft answer\r\nthat turneth away wrath. He understands Spanish perfectly well, but\r\ndoes not speak it very fluently. Aguinaldo's explanation to me of the\r\ninitial acts of rebellion was as follows:--He had reason to know that,\r\nin consequence of something having leaked out in Manila regarding\r\nthe immature plans of the conspirators, he was a marked man, so he\r\nresolved to face the situation boldly. He had then been petty-governor\r\nof his town (Cauit) sixteen months, and in that official capacity he\r\nsummoned the local detachment of the civil guard to the Town Hall,\r\nhaving previously arranged his plan of action with the town guards\r\n(_cuadrilleros_). Aguinaldo then spoke aside to the sergeant, to whom\r\nhe proposed the surrender of their arms. As he quite anticipated, his\r\ndemand was refused, so he gave the agreed signal to his _cuadrilleros_,\r\nwho immediately surrounded the guards and disarmed them. Thereupon\r\nAguinaldo and his companions, being armed, fled at once to the next\r\npost of the civil guard and seized their weapons also. With this\r\nsmall equipment he and his party escaped into the interior of the\r\nprovince, towards Silan, situated at the base of the Sungay [178]\r\nMountain, where the numerous ravines in the slopes running towards\r\nthe Lake Bombon (popularly known as the Lake of Taal) afforded a\r\nsafe retreat to the rebels. Hundreds of natives soon joined him,\r\nfor the secret of Aguinaldo's influence was the widespread popular\r\nbelief in his possession of the _anting-anting_ (_vide_ p. 237);\r\nhis continuous successes, in the first operations, strengthened this\r\nbelief; indeed, he seemed to have the lucky star of a De Wet without\r\nthe military genius.\r\n\r\nOn August 31, 1896, eleven days after the plot was discovered in\r\nManila, he issued his _pronunciamiento_ simultaneously at his\r\nbirthplace, at Novaleta, and at San Francisco de Malabon. This\r\ndocument, however, is of little historic value, for, instead of\r\nsetting forth the aims of the revolutionists, it is simply a wild\r\nexhortation to the people, in general vague terms, to take arms and\r\nfree themselves from oppression. In San Francisco de Malabon Aguinaldo\r\nrallied his forces prior to their march to Imus, [179] their great\r\nstrategic point. The village itself, situated in the centre of a large,\r\nwell-watered plain, surrounded by planted land, was nothing--a mere\r\ncollection of wooden or bamboo-and-thatch dwellings. The distance\r\nfrom Manila would be about 16 miles by land, with good roads leading\r\nto the bay shore towns. The people were very poor, being tenants\r\nor dependents of the friars; hence the only building of importance\r\nwas the friars' estate-house, which was really a fortress in the\r\nestimation of the natives. This residence was situated in the middle\r\nof a compound surrounded by massive high walls, and to it some 17\r\nfriars fled on the first alarm. For the rebels, therefore, Imus\r\nhad a double value--the so-called fortress and the capture of the\r\npriests. After a siege which lasted long enough for General Blanco to\r\nhave sent troops against them, the rebels captured Imus estate-house\r\non September 1, and erected barricades there. Thirteen of the priests\r\nfell into their hands. They cut trenches and threw up earthworks in\r\nseveral of the main roads of the province, and strengthened their\r\nposition at Novaleta. Marauding parties were sent out everywhere\r\nto steal the crops and live-stock, which were conveyed in large\r\nquantities to Imus. Some of the captured priests were treated most\r\nbarbarously. One was cut up piecemeal; another was saturated with\r\npetroleum and set on fire, and a third was bathed in oil and fried\r\non a bamboo spit run through the length of his body. There was a\r\n_Requiem_ Mass for this event. During the first few months of the\r\nrising many such atrocities were committed by the insurgents. The\r\nNaig outrage caused a great sensation in the capital. The lieutenant\r\nhad been killed, and the ferocious band of rebels seized his widow\r\nand daughter eleven years old. The child was ravished to death,\r\nand they were just digging a pit to bury the mother alive when she\r\nwas rescued and brought to Manila in the steam-launch _Mariposa_\r\nraving mad, disguised as a native woman. Aguinaldo, personally,\r\nwas humanely inclined, for at his headquarters he held captive one\r\nSpanish trooper, an army lieutenant, a Spanish planter, a friar, and\r\ntwo Spanish ladies, all of whom were fairly well treated. The priest\r\nwas allowed to read his missal, the lieutenant and trooper were made\r\nblacksmiths, and the planter had to try his hand at tailoring.\r\n\r\nThe insurgents occupied Paranaque and Las Pinas on the outskirts\r\nof Manila, and when General Blanco had 5,000 fresh troops at his\r\ndisposal he still refrained from attacking the rebels in their\r\npositions. Military men, in conversation with me, excused this\r\ninaction on the ground that, to rout the rebels completely without\r\nhaving sufficient troops to garrison the places taken and to form\r\nflying columns to prevent the insurgents fleeing to the mountain\r\nfastnesses, would only require them to do the work over again when\r\nthey reappeared. So General Blanco went on waiting in the hope that\r\nmore troops would arrive with which to inflict such a crushing defeat\r\non the rebels as would ensure a lasting peace. The rebels were in\r\npossession of Imus for several months. Three weeks after they took it,\r\nartillery was slowly carried over to Cavite, which is connected with\r\nthe mainland by a narrow isthmus, so the rebels hastened to construct\r\na long line of trenches immediately to the south of this (_vide_ map),\r\nwhereby communication with the heart of the province was effectually\r\ncut off. Not only did their mile and a half of trenches and stockade\r\ncheck any advance into the interior from the isthmus, but it served\r\nas a rallying-point whence Cavite itself was menaced. The Spaniards,\r\ntherefore, forced to take the offensive to save Cavite falling into\r\nrebel hands, made an attack on the Novaleta defences with Spanish\r\ntroops and loyal native auxiliaries on November 10. The next day the\r\nSpaniards were repulsed at Binacayan with the loss of one-third of\r\nthe 73rd Native Regiment and 60 Spanish troops, with 50 of both corps\r\nwounded. The intention to carry artillery towards Imus was abandoned\r\nand the Spaniards fell back on Dalahican, about a mile north of the\r\nrebel trenches of Novaleta, where they established a camp at which I\r\nspent a whole day. They had four large guns and two bronze mortars;\r\nin the trench adjoining the camp they had one gun. The troops numbered\r\n3,500 Spaniards under the command of General Rios. The 73rd Native\r\nRegiment survivors had quarters there, but they were constantly engaged\r\nin making sorties on the road leading to Manila. No further attempt\r\nwas made in General Blanco's time to dislodge the rebels from their\r\nsplendidly-constructed trenches, which, however, could easily have\r\nbeen shelled from the sea side.\r\n\r\nA number of supposed promoters of the rebellion filled the Cavite\r\nprison, and I went over to witness the execution of 13 of them on\r\nSeptember 12. I knew two or three of them by sight. One was a Chinese\r\nhalf-caste, the son of a rich Chinaman then living. The father was\r\nheld to be a respectable man of coolie origin, but the son, long\r\nbefore the rebellion, had a worthless reputation.\r\n\r\nIn the Provinces of Pampanga and Bulacan, north of Manila, the rebel\r\nmob, under the command of a native of Cabiao (Nueva Ecija) named\r\nLlaneras, was about 3,000 strong. To oppose this Major Lopez Arteaga\r\nhad a flying column of 500 men, and between the contending parties\r\nthere were repeated encounters with no definite result. Whenever the\r\nrebels were beaten off and pursued they fled to their strongholds\r\nof San Mateo (Manila, now Rizal) and Angat (Bulacan). The Spaniards\r\nmade an unsuccessful attempt to dislodge the enemy at Angat, whilst\r\nat San Mateo, where they were supposed to be 5,000 strong, they were\r\nleft undisturbed. The rebels attacked Calumpit (Bulacan), pillaged\r\nseveral houses, decapitated an Englishman's cook, and drove the civil\r\nguard and the parish priest up the belfry tower. On the other side\r\nof the river, Llaneras visited the rice-mills of an Anglo-American\r\nfirm, took some refreshment, and assured the manager, Mr. Scott,\r\nthat the rebels had not the least intention to interfere with any\r\nforeigners (as distinguished from Spaniards), against whom they had\r\nno complaint whatever.\r\n\r\nAt length a plan of campaign was prepared, and expeditionary forces\r\nwere to march in two directions through the disaffected provinces south\r\nof Manila, and combine, according to circumstances, when the bulk of\r\nthe rebels could be driven together. One division operated from the\r\nlake town of Vinan, whilst General Jaramillo took his troops round to\r\nBatangas Province and worked northwards. Before the lake forces had\r\ngone very far they met with a reverse at the hands of the rebels in\r\nthe neighbourhood of Carmona, but rallied and pushed on towards the\r\nrebel quarters near Silan, where the enemy was apparently concentrating\r\nfor a great struggle. The combined columns under General Jaramillo at\r\nlength opened the attack. A pitched battle was fought, and no quarter\r\nwas given on either side. This fierce contest lasted a whole day,\r\nand the Spaniards were forced to retire with considerable loss. The\r\ncombined operations accomplished nothing decisive, and served only\r\nto check an advance on the capital by the rebels, who were already\r\nin practical possession of the whole of Cavite province excepting\r\nthe port, arsenal, and isthmus of Cavite.\r\n\r\nIn Manila the volunteers mounted guard whilst the regulars went to\r\nthe front. For a while the volunteers were allowed to make domiciliary\r\nsearch, and they did very much as they liked. Domiciliary search was\r\nso much abused that it had to be forbidden, for the volunteers took\r\nto entering any house they chose, and roughly examined the persons of\r\nnatives to see if they had the _Katipunan_ brand. Crowds of suspects\r\nwere brought into Manila, and shiploads of them were sent away in\r\nlocal steamers to the Caroline Islands and Mindanao, whilst every\r\nmail-steamer carried batches of them _en route_ for Fernando Po. On\r\nOctober 1 the s.s. _Manila_ sailed with 300 Filipinos for Chafarinas\r\nIslands, Ceuta, and other African penal settlements. In the local\r\nsteamers many of them died on the way. The ordinary prisons were more\r\nthan full, and about 600 suspects were confined in the dungeons of Fort\r\nSantiago at the mouth of the Pasig River, where a frightful tragedy\r\noccurred. The dungeons were over-crowded; the river-water filtered in\r\nthrough the crevices in the ancient masonry; the Spanish sergeant on\r\nduty threw his rug over the only light- and ventilating-shaft, and in\r\na couple of days carts were seen by many citizens carrying away the\r\ndead, calculated to number 70. Provincial governors and parish priests\r\nseemed to regard it as a duty to supply the capital with batches of\r\n\"suspects\" from their localities. In Vigan, where nothing had occurred,\r\nmany of the heads of the best families and moneyed men were arrested\r\nand brought to Manila in a steamer. They were bound hand and foot,\r\nand carried like packages of merchandise in the hold. I happened to\r\nbe on the quay when the steamer discharged her living freight with\r\nchains and hooks to haul up and swing out the bodies like bales of\r\nhemp. From Nueva Caceres (Camarines), the Abellas and several other\r\nrich families and native priests were seized and shipped off. Poor\r\nold Manuel Abella, like scores of others, was tortured in Bilibid\r\nprison and finally shot. He was a notary, unfortunately possessed of a\r\nfine estate coveted by an impecunious Spaniard, who denounced Abella,\r\nand was rewarded by being appointed \"Administrator\" of his property,\r\nout of which he so enriched himself that he was able, in a few months,\r\nto return to Spain in a good financial position. A friend of mine,\r\na native planter of Balayan, was imprisoned for months, and then\r\nsent back to his town declared innocent. He had been a marked man\r\nsince 1895, just after his son Quintin, a law student, had had a\r\nlittle altercation with his clerical professors in Manila. Thousands\r\nof peaceful natives were treated with unjustifiable ferocity. The old\r\ntorture-chamber on the ground-floor of the convent of Baliuag (Bulacan)\r\nis still shown to visitors. The court-martial, established under\r\nthe presidency of a colonel, little by little practised systematic\r\nextortion, for, within three months of the outbreak, hundreds of the\r\nrichest natives and half-castes in Manila were imprisoned for a few\r\ndays and released _conditionally_. From the lips of my late friend,\r\nTelesforo Chuidian, a wealthy Chinese half-caste, known to all Manila\r\nsociety, I heard of the squalid misery and privations to which he and\r\nothers of his class were subjected, but the complete list would fill\r\na page. Some were even re-arrested for the same nefarious purpose,\r\nand the daily papers published their names on each occasion. Archbishop\r\nNozaleda and Gov.-General Blanco were at variance from the beginning of\r\nthe revolt, and in accordance with historical precedent it could only\r\nend in one way, namely, that the clerical party advised the Canovas\r\nMinistry to recall the General and appoint in his stead another who\r\nwould be obedient to the friars.\r\n\r\nGeneral Blanco was not sufficiently sanguinary for the monks. As a\r\nstrategist he had refused, at the outset, to undertake with 1,500\r\nEuropean troops a task which was only accomplished by his successor\r\nwith 28,000 men. But the priests thought they knew better, and Blanco\r\nleft for Spain in December, 1896. The relative positions of the parties\r\nat this crisis stood as follows:--The rebels were in possession of\r\nthe whole of the Province of Cavite excepting the city and arsenal of\r\nCavite and the isthmus connecting that city with the mainland. They\r\nwere well fortified at Imus with trenches and stockades extending\r\nfrom the estate-house fort in several directions, defended by an\r\narmy of 6,000 to 7,000 men. Their artillery was most primitive,\r\nhowever, consisting only of a few small guns called _lantacas_,\r\nsome new guns of small calibre roughly cast out of the church bells,\r\nand iron waterpipes of large diameter converted into _mitrailleuse_\r\nmortars. They were strongly entrenched behind a mile and a half of\r\nstrategically constructed earthworks defending the town of Novaleta,\r\nwhich they held. They were supposed to have at least 20,000 men\r\nin occupation there. Including San Francisco de Malabon, Silan,\r\nPerez Dasmarinas, and the several other places they held, their\r\ntotal force in the whole province was estimated at 35,000 men. About\r\none-fifth of that number was armed with rifles (chiefly Mauesers), the\r\nremainder carrying bowie-knives and bamboo lances. The bowie-knife was\r\nirresistible by the Spaniards when the native came to close-quarter\r\nfighting. The rebels had ample supplies of rice, buffaloes, etc.,\r\nstolen from the non-combatant natives. To my personal knowledge\r\nthey had daily communication with Manila, and knew everything that\r\nwas going on there and the public feeling in the capital. They had\r\nfailed in the attempt to seize the town of Santa Cruz (La Laguna),\r\nwhere they killed one Spaniard and then retreated. Loyal natives in\r\nVinan organized volunteer forces to keep them out of that town. Those\r\nManila volunteers known as the _Guerrilla a muerte_ battalion, with\r\na few regulars, frequently patrolled the lake coast in steam-launches\r\nfrom Manila, and kept the rebels from occupying that district. North\r\nof Manila the rebellion reached no farther than Bulacan and Pampanga\r\nProvinces, where Llaneras's flying column, together with the rebels\r\nin the mountain fastnesses of Angat and San Mateo, amounted to\r\nabout 10,000 men. Llaneras notified the Manila-Dagupan (English)\r\nRailway officials that they were to cease carrying loyal troops on\r\ntheir line; but as those orders were not heeded, a train was wrecked\r\non November 19 about 20 miles up from the capital. The locomotive\r\nand five carriages were smashed, the permanent-way was somewhat\r\ndamaged, five individuals were wounded, and the total loss sustained\r\nwas estimated at P40,000. In the last week of November the friars'\r\nestate-house at Malinta, some five miles north of Manila, was in\r\nflames; we could see the blaze from the bay. The slightest reverse\r\nto Spanish arms always drew a further crowd of rebels into the field.\r\n\r\nThe total European force when General Blanco left was about 10,000\r\nmen. In Cavite Province the Spaniards held only the camp of Dalahican,\r\nand the city and arsenal of Cavite with the isthmus. The total number\r\nof suspects shipped away was about 1,000. I was informed by my friend\r\nthe Secretary of the Military Court that 4,377 individuals were\r\nawaiting trial by court-martial. The possibility of the insurgents\r\never being able to enter the capital was never believed in by the\r\nlarge majority of Europeans, although from a month after the outbreak\r\nthe rebels continued to hold posts within a couple of hours' march\r\nfrom the old walls. The natives, however, were led to expect that the\r\nrebels would make an attempt to occupy the city on Saint Andrew's Day\r\n(the patron-saint day of Manila, _vide_ p. 50). The British Consul\r\nand a few British merchants were of opinion that a raid on the\r\ncapital was imminent, and I, among others, was invited by letter,\r\ndated Manila, November 16, 1896, and written under the authority of\r\nH.B.M.'s Consul, to attend a meeting on the 18th of that month at the\r\noffices of a British establishment to concert measures for escape in\r\nsuch a contingency. In spite of these fears, business was carried on\r\nwithout the least apparent interruption.\r\n\r\nWhen General Blanco reached Spain he quietly lodged at the Hotel de\r\nRoma in Madrid, and then took a private residence. Out of courtesy\r\nhe was offered a position in the _Cuarto Militar_, which he declined\r\nto accept. For several months he remained under a political cloud,\r\ncharged with incompetency to quell the Philippine Rebellion. But there\r\nis something to be said in justification of Blanco's inaction. He was\r\nimportuned from the beginning by the relentless Archbishop and many\r\nleading civilians to take the offensive and start a war _a outrance_\r\nwith an inadequate number of European soldiers. His 6,000 native\r\nauxiliaries (as it proved later on) could not be relied upon in a\r\n_civil_ war. Against the foreign invader, with Spanish prestige still\r\nhigh, they would have made good loyal fighting-material. Blanco was\r\nno novice in civil wars. I remember his career during the previous\r\ntwenty-five years. With his 700 European troops he parried off the\r\nattacks of the first armed mobs in the Province of Manila (now Rizal),\r\nand defended the city and the approaches to the capital. Five hundred\r\nEuropean troops had to be left, here and there, in Visayas for the\r\nordinary defence. Before the balance of 300 could be embarked in half\r\na dozen places in the south and landed in Manila, the whole Province\r\nof Cavite was in arms. He could not leave the defence of the city\r\nentirely in the hands of untrained and undrilled volunteers and march\r\nthe whole of his European regular troops into another province. A\r\nsevere reverse, on the first encounter, might have proved fatal\r\nto Spanish sovereignty. Blanco had the enormous disadvantage (one\r\nmust live there to appreciate it) of the wet season, and the rebels\r\nunderstood this. He had, therefore, to damp the movement by feigning\r\nto attach to it as little importance as possible. Lastly, Blanco was\r\na man of moderate and humane tendencies; a colonial governor of the\r\nlate Martinez Campos school, whose policy is--when all honourable\r\npeaceful means are exhausted, use force.\r\n\r\nThe Canovas party was broken up by the assassination of the Prime\r\nMinister on August 8, 1897. This ministry was followed by the\r\nprovisional Azcarraga Cabinet, which, at the end of six weeks, was\r\nsuperseded by the Liberal party under the leadership of Praxedes\r\nSagasta, who, to temporize with America, recalled the inflexible\r\nGeneral Weyler from Cuba, and on October 9 appointed General Ramon\r\nBlanco, Marquis de Pena Plata, to take the command there.\r\n\r\nGeneral Camilo Polavieja (Marquis de Polavieja) arrived in Manila in\r\nDecember, 1896, as the successor of Blanco and the chosen _Messiah_\r\nof the friars. He had made a great name in Cuba as an _energetic_\r\nmilitary leader, which, in Spanish colonies, always implied a tinge\r\nof wanton cruelty. In Spain he was regarded as the right arm of the\r\nultra-clericals and a possible supporter of Carlism. He was accompanied\r\nby General Lachambre, whose acquaintance I made in Havana. In the\r\nsame steamer with General Polavieja came 500 troops, whilst another\r\nsteamer simultaneously brought 1,500. Polavieja, therefore, on landing,\r\nhad about 12,000 European troops and 6,000 native auxiliaries; but\r\neach steamer brought fresh supplies until the total European land\r\nforces amounted to 28,000. By this time, however, the 6,000 native\r\ntroops were very considerably reduced by desertion, and the remainder\r\ncould hardly be relied upon. But Polavieja started his campaign with\r\nthe immense advantage of having the _whole_ of the dry season before\r\nhim. General Lachambre, as Deputy Commander of the forces, at once took\r\nthe field against the rebels in Cavite Province. It would be tedious\r\nto relate in detail the numerous encounters with the enemy over this\r\narea. Battles were fought at Naig, Maragondon, Perez Dasmarinas,\r\nNasugbu, Taal, Bacoor, Novaleta, and other places. Imus, which in\r\nManila was popularly supposed to be a fortress of relative magnitude,\r\nwhence the rebels would dispute every inch of ground, was attacked\r\nby a large force of loyal troops. On their approach the rebels set\r\nfire to the village and fled. Very few remained to meet the Spaniards,\r\nand as these few tried to escape across the paddy-fields and down the\r\nriver they were picked off by sharp-shooters. It was a victory for the\r\nSpaniards, inasmuch as their demonstration of force scared the rebels\r\ninto evacuation. But it was necessary to take Silan, which the rebels\r\nhastened to strengthen, closely followed up by the Spaniards. The\r\nplace was well defended by earthworks and natural parapets, and\r\nfor several hours the issue of the contest was doubtful. The rebels\r\nfought bravely, leaping from boulder to boulder to meet the foe. In\r\nevery close-quarter combat the bowie-knife had a terrible effect, and\r\nthe loyal troops had suffered heavily when a column of Spaniards was\r\nmarched round to the rear of the rebels' principal parapet. They were\r\nlowered down with ropes on to a rising ground facing this parapet, and\r\npoured in a continuous rifle fire until the rebels had to evacuate it,\r\nand the general rout commenced with great slaughter to the insurgents,\r\nwho dispersed in all directions. Their last stronghold south of Manila\r\nhaving been taken, they broke up into small detachments, which were\r\nchased and beaten wherever they made a stand. The Spaniards suffered\r\ngreat losses, but they gained their point, for the rebels, unable\r\nto hold any one place against this onslaught, were driven up to the\r\nLaguna Province and endeavoured unsuccessfully to hold the town of\r\nSanta Cruz. It is interesting to remark, in order to show what the\r\nrebel aim at that time really was, that they entered here with the\r\ncry of \"Long live Spain; Death to the Friars!\" After three months'\r\nhard fighting, General Lachambre was proclaimed the Liberator of Cavite\r\nand the adjoining districts, for, by the middle of March, 1897, every\r\nrebel contingent of any importance in that locality had been dispersed.\r\n\r\nLike every other Spanish general in supreme command abroad, Polavieja\r\nhad his enemies in Spain. The organs of the Liberal party attacked him\r\nunsparingly. Polavieja, as everybody knew, was the chosen executive\r\nof the friars, whose only care was to secure their own position. He\r\nwas dubbed the \"General Cristiano.\" He was their ideal, and worked\r\nhand-in-hand with them. He cabled for more troops to be sent with\r\nwhich to garrison the reconquered districts and have his army corps\r\nfree to stamp out the rebellion, which was confined to the Northern\r\nProvinces. Cuba, which had already drained the Peninsula of over\r\n200,000 men, still required fresh levies to replace the sick and\r\nwounded, and Polavieja's demand was refused. Immediately after\r\nthis he cabled that his physical ailments compelled him to resign\r\nthe commandership-in-chief, and begged the Government to appoint a\r\nsuccessor. The Madrid journals hostile to him thereupon indirectly\r\nattributed to him a lie, and questioned whether his resignation was\r\ndue to ill-health or his resentment of the refusal to send out more\r\ntroops. Still urging his resignation, General Fernando Primo de Rivera\r\nwas gazetted to succeed him, and Polavieja embarked at Manila for Spain\r\non April 15, 1897. General Lachambre, as the hero of Cavite, followed\r\nto receive the applause which was everywhere showered upon him in\r\nSpain. As to Polavieja's merits, public opinion was very much divided,\r\nand as soon as it was known that he was on the way, a controversy was\r\nstarted in the Madrid press as to how he ought to be received. _El\r\nImparcial_ maintained that he was worthy of being honoured as a 19th\r\ncentury conquering hero. This gave rise to a volley of abuse on the\r\nother side, who raked up all his antecedents and supposed tendencies,\r\nand openly denounced him as a dangerous politician and the supporter\r\nof theocratic absolutism. According to _El Liberal_ of May 11, Senor\r\nOrdax Avecilla, of the Red Cross Society, stated in his speech at\r\nthe Madrid Mercantile Club, \"If he (the General) thought of becoming\r\ndictator, he would fall from the heights of his glory to the Hades\r\nof nonentity.\" His enemies persistently insinuated that he was really\r\nreturning to Spain to support the clericals actively. But perhaps the\r\nbitterest satire was levelled against him in _El Pais_ of May 10,\r\nwhich, in an article headed \"The Great Farce,\" said: \"Do you know\r\nwho is coming? Cyrus, King of Persia; Alexander, King of Macedonia;\r\nCaesar Augustus; Scipio the African; Gonzalo de Cordova; Napoleon, the\r\nGreat Napoleon, conqueror of worlds. What? Oh, unfortunate people,\r\ndo you not know? Polavieja is coming, the incomparable Polavieja,\r\ncrowned with laurels, commanding a fleet laden to the brim with rich\r\ntrophies; it is Polavieja, gentlemen, who returns, discoverer of new\r\nworlds, to lay at the feet of Isabella the Catholic his conquering\r\nsword; it is Polavieja who returns after having cast into obscurity\r\nthe glories of Hernan Cortes; Polavieja, who has widened the national\r\nmap, and brings new territories to the realm--new thrones to his\r\nqueen. What can the people be thinking of that they remain thus in\r\nsilence? Applaud, imbeciles! It is Narvaez who is resuscitated. Now\r\nwe have another master!\" No Spanish general who had arrived at\r\nPolavieja's position would find it possible to be absolutely neutral\r\nin politics, but to compare him with Narvaez, the military dictator,\r\nproved in a few days' time to be the grossest absurdity. On May\r\n13 Polavieja arrived in Barcelona physically broken, half blind,\r\nand with evident traces of a disordered liver. His detractors were\r\nsilent; an enthusiastic crowd welcomed him for his achievements. He\r\nhad broken the neck of the rebellion, but by what means? Altogether,\r\napart from the circumstances of legitimate warfare, in which probably\r\nneither party was more merciful than the other, he initiated a system\r\nof striking terror into the non-combatant population by barbarous\r\ntortures and wholesale executions. On February 6, 1897, in one\r\nprison alone (Bilibid) there were 1,266 suspects, most of whom were\r\nbrought in by the volunteers, for the forces in the field gave little\r\nquarter and rarely made prisoners. The functions of the volunteers,\r\norganized originally for the defence of the city and suburbs, became\r\nso elastic that, night after night, they made men and women come\r\nout of their houses for inspection conducted most indecorously. The\r\nmen were escorted to the prisons from pure caprice, and subjected to\r\nexcessive maltreatment. Many of them were liberated in the course of a\r\nfew days, declared innocent, but maimed for life and for ever unable\r\nto get a living. Some of these victims were well known to everybody\r\nin Manila; for instance, Dr. Zamora, Bonifacio Arevalo the dentist,\r\nAntonio Rivero (who died under torture), and others. The only apparent\r\nobject in all this was to disseminate broadcast living examples of\r\nSpanish vengeance, in order to overawe the populace. Under General\r\nBlanco's administration such acts had been distinctly prohibited on\r\nthe representation of General Carlos Roca.\r\n\r\nPolavieja's rule brought the brilliant career of the notable Filipino,\r\nDr. Jose Rizal y Mercado, to a fatal end. Born in Calamba (La Laguna),\r\nthree hours' journey from Manila, on June 19, 1861, he was destined\r\nto become the idol of his countrymen, and consequently the victim of\r\nthe friars and General Polavieja. Often have I, together with the old\r\nnative parish priest, Father Leoncio Lopez, spent an hour with Jose's\r\nfather, Francisco Mercado, and heard the old man descant, with pride,\r\non the intellectual progress of his son at the Jesuits' school in\r\nManila. Before he was fourteen years of age he wrote a melodrama in\r\nverse entitled _Junto al Pasig_ (\"Beside the Pasig River\"), which was\r\nperformed in public and well received. But young Jose yearned to set\r\nout on a wider field of learning. His ambition was to go to Europe,\r\nand at the age of twenty-one he went to Spain, studied medicine,\r\nand entered the Madrid University, where he graduated as Doctor of\r\nMedicine and Philosophy. He subsequently continued his studies in\r\nParis, Brussels, London, and at several seats of learning in Germany,\r\nwhere he obtained another degree, notwithstanding the fact that he had\r\nthe difficulty of a foreign language to contend with. As happened to\r\nmany of his _confreres_ in the German Universities, a career of study\r\nhad simultaneously opened his eyes to a clearer conception of the\r\nrights of humanity. Thrown among companions of socialistic tendencies,\r\nhis belief in and loyalty to the monarchical rule of his country were\r\nyet unshaken by the influence of such environment; he was destined\r\nonly to become a disturbing element, and a would-be reformer of that\r\ntime-worn institution which rendered secular government in his native\r\nland a farce. To give him a party name, he became an anti-clerical,\r\nstrictly in a political and lawful sense. He was a Roman Catholic, but\r\nhis sole aim, outside his own profession, was to save his country from\r\nthe baneful influence of the Spanish friars who there held the Civil\r\nand Military Government under their tutelage. He sought to place his\r\ncountry on a level of material and moral prosperity with others, and he\r\nknew that the first step in that direction was to secure the expulsion\r\nof the Monastic Orders. He sympathized with that movement which, during\r\nhis childhood, culminated in the Cavite Conspiracy (_vide_ p. 106). He\r\nlooked profoundly into the causes of his country's unhappiness, and to\r\npromote their knowledge, in a popular form, he wrote and published in\r\nGermany, in the Spanish language, a book entitled \"Noli me tangere.\" It\r\nis a censorious satirical novel, of no great literary merit, but it\r\nserved the author's purpose to expose the inner life, the arrogance,\r\nand the despotism of the friars in their relations with the natives. On\r\nhis return to the Islands, a year after the publication of this work,\r\nwe met at the house of a mutual friend and conversed on the subject of\r\n\"Noli me tangere,\" a copy of which he lent to me.\r\n\r\nAs an oculist Rizal performed some very clever operations, but he\r\nhad another mission--one which brought upon him all the odium of the\r\nclerical party, but which as quickly raised him in popular esteem in\r\nnative circles. He led a party in his own town who dared to dispute\r\nthe legality of the Dominican Order's possession of a large tract of\r\nagricultural land. He called upon the Order to show their title-deeds,\r\nbut was met with a contemptuous refusal. At length prudence dictated\r\na return to Europe. I often recall the farewell lunch we had together\r\nat the Restaurant de Paris, in the _Escolta_. During his absence his\r\nown relations and the chief families in his town became the objects\r\nof persecution. They were driven from the lands they cultivated and\r\nrented from the Religious Order, without compensation for improvements,\r\nand Spaniards took their holdings. In 1890 Rizal saw with his own eyes,\r\nand perhaps with envy, the growing prosperity of Japan; but the idea\r\nof annexation to that country was distasteful to him, as he feared\r\nthe Japanese might prove to be rather harsh masters. On his return to\r\nEurope he contributed many brilliant articles to _La Solidaridad_, the\r\nMadrid-Philippine organ mentioned on p. 363; but, disgusted with his\r\nfailure to awaken in Spain a sympathetic interest in his own country's\r\nmisfortunes, he left that field of work and re-visited London, where he\r\nfound encouragement and very material assistance from an old friend of\r\nmine, a distinguished Filipino. Rizal's financial resources were none\r\ntoo plentiful, and he himself was anxious for a position of productive\r\nactivity. It was proposed that he should establish himself in London\r\nas a doctor, but with his mind always bent on the concerns of his\r\ncountry he again took to literary work. He edited a new edition of\r\nDr. Antonio de Morga's work on the Philippines [180] (the original\r\nwas published in Mexico in 1609), with notes, and wrote a new book in\r\nthe form of romance, entitled \"El Filibusterismo,\" [181] the purpose\r\nof which was to show how the Filipinos were goaded into outlawry.\r\n\r\nAbout this time two priests, C---- and C----, who had seceded from\r\nthe Roman Catholic Church, called upon my Philippine friend to urge\r\nhim to take an interest in their projected evangelical work in the\r\nIslands. They even proposed to establish a new Church there and appoint\r\na hierarchy--an extremely risky venture indeed. My friend was asked\r\nto nominate some Filipino for the archbishopric. It was put before\r\nRizal, but he declined the honour on the ground that the acceptance\r\nof such an office would sorely offend his mother. Finally, in 1893,\r\na Pampanga Filipino, named C----, came on the scene and proposed to\r\nfurnish Rizal with ample funds for the establishment of a Philippine\r\ncollege in Hong-Kong. Rizal accepted the offer and set out for that\r\ncolony, where he waited in vain for the money. For a while he hesitated\r\nbetween following the medical profession in Hong-Kong and returning\r\nto Manila. Mutual friends of ours urged him not to risk a re-entry\r\ninto the Islands; nevertheless, communications passed between him\r\nand the Gov.-General through the Spanish Consul, and nothing could\r\ninduce him to keep out of the lion's mouth. Rizal avowed that he had\r\nbeen given to understand that he could return to the Islands without\r\nfear for his personal safety and liberty. He arrived in Manila and was\r\narrested. His luggage was searched in the Custom-house, and a number\r\nof those seditious proclamations referred to at p. 204 were found,\r\nit was alleged, in his trunks. It is contrary to all common sense to\r\nconceive that a sane man, who had entertained the least doubt as to\r\nhis personal liberty, would bring with him, into a public department of\r\nscrutiny, documentary evidence of his own culpability. He was arraigned\r\nbefore the supreme authority, in whose presence he defended himself\r\nright nobly. The clerical party wanted his blood, but Gov.-General\r\nDespujols would not yield. Rizal was either guilty or innocent,\r\nand should have been fully acquitted or condemned; but to meet the\r\nmatter half way he was banished to Dapitan, a town on the north shore\r\nof Mindanao Island. I saw the bungalow, situated at the extremity of\r\na pretty little horse-shoe bay, where he lived nearly four years in\r\nbondage. His bright intelligence, his sociability, and his scientific\r\nattainments had won him the respect and admiration of both the civil\r\nand religious local authorities. He had such a well-justified good\r\nrepute as an oculist that many travelled across the seas to seek his\r\naid. The Cuban insurrection being in full operation, it opened the\r\nway for a new and interesting period in Rizal's life. Reading between\r\nthe lines of the letters he was allowed to send to his friends, there\r\nwas evidence of his being weighed down with _ennui_ from inactivity,\r\nand his friends in Europe took the opportunity of bringing pressure\r\non the Madrid Government to liberate him. In a house which I visit\r\nin London there were frequent consultations as to how this could be\r\neffected. In the end it was agreed to organize a bogus \"Society for\r\nthe Liberation of Prisoners in the Far East.\" A few ladies met at the\r\nhouse mentioned, and one of them, Miss A----, having been appointed\r\nsecretary, she was sent to Madrid to present a petition from the\r\n\"Society\" to the Prime Minister, Canovas del Castillo, praying for\r\nthe liberation of Rizal in exchange for his professional services\r\nin the Spanish army operating in Cuba, where army doctors were much\r\nneeded. Hints were deftly thrown out about the \"Society's\" relations\r\nwith other European capitals, and the foreign lady-secretary played\r\nher part so adroitly that the Prime Minister pictured to himself\r\nambassadorial intervention and foreign complications if he did not\r\ngrant the prayer of what he imagined to be an influential society with\r\npotential ramifications. The Colonial Minister opposed the petition;\r\nthe War Minister, being Philippine born, declined to act on his own\r\nresponsibility for obvious reasons. Repeated discussions took place\r\nbetween the Crown advisers, to whom, at length, the Prime Minister\r\ndisclosed his fears, and finally the Gov.-General of the Philippines,\r\nDon Ramon Blanco, was authorized to liberate Rizal, on the terms\r\nmentioned, if he saw no objection. As my Philippine friend, who went\r\nfrom London to Madrid about the matter, remarked to the War Minister,\r\n\"Rizal is loyal; he will do his duty; but if he did not, one more or\r\nless in the rebel camp--what matters?\" The Gov.-General willingly\r\nacted on the powers received from the Home Government, and Rizal's\r\nconditional freedom dated from July 28, 1896. The governor of Dapitan\r\nwas instructed to ask Rizal if he wished to go to Cuba as an army\r\ndoctor, and the reply being in the affirmative, he was conducted on\r\nboard the steamer for Manila, calling on the way at Cebu, where crowds\r\nof natives and half-castes went on board to congratulate him. He had\r\nbecome the idol of the people in his exile; his ideas were _then_\r\nthe reflection of all Philippine aims and ambitions; the very name of\r\nRizal raised their hopes to the highest pitch. Most fantastic reports\r\nwere circulated concerning him. Deeds in Europe, almost amounting\r\nto miracles, were attributed to his genius, and became current talk\r\namong the natives when they spoke _sotto voce_ of Rizal's power and\r\ninfluence. He was looked up to as the future regenerator of his race,\r\ncapable of moving armies and navies for the cause of liberty. Their\r\nvery reverence was his condemnation in the eyes of the priests.\r\n\r\nThere were no inter-island cables in those days, and the arrival\r\nof Rizal in the port of Manila was a surprise to the friars. They\r\nexpostulated with General Blanco. They openly upbraided him for\r\nhaving set free the soul of disaffection; but the general would not\r\nrelinquish his intention, explaining, very logically, that if Rizal\r\nwere the soul of rebellion he was now about to depart. The friars were\r\neager for Rival's blood, and the parish priest of Tondo arranged\r\na revolt of the _caudrilleros_ (guards) of that suburb, hoping\r\nthereby to convince General Blanco that the rebellion was in full\r\ncry, consequent on his folly. No doubt, by this trick of the friars,\r\nmany civilian Spaniards were deceived into an honest belief in the\r\nineptitude of the Gov.-General. In a state of frenzy a body of them,\r\nheaded by Father Mariano Gil, marched to the palace of Malacanan to\r\ndemand an explanation of General Blanco. The gates were closed by order\r\nof the captain of the guard. When the general learnt what the howling\r\noutside signified he mounted his horse, and, at the head of his guards,\r\nmet the excited crowd and ordered them to quit the precincts of the\r\npalace, or he would put them out by force. The abashed priest [182]\r\nthereupon withdrew with his companions, but from that day the occult\r\npower of the friars was put in motion to bring about the recall of\r\nGeneral Blanco. In the meantime Rizal had been detained in the Spanish\r\ncruiser _Castilla_ lying in the bay. Thence he was transferred to the\r\nmail-steamer _Isla de Panay_ bound to Barcelona. He carried with him\r\nletters of recommendation to the Ministers of War and the Colonies,\r\ncourteously sent to him by General Blanco with the following letter\r\nto himself:--\r\n\r\n\r\n(_Translation_.)\r\n\r\n_Manila_, _30th August_, 1896.\r\n\r\n_Dr. Jose Rizal_.\r\n\r\n_My Dear Sir_,--\r\n\r\nEnclosed I send you two letters, for the Ministers of War and the\r\nColonies respectively, which I believe will ensure to you a good\r\nreception. I cannot doubt that you will show me respect in your\r\nrelations with the Government, and by your future conduct, not only\r\non account of your word pledged, but because passing events must make\r\nit clear to you how certain proceedings, due to extravagant notions\r\ncan only produce hatred, ruin, tears and bloodshed. That you may be\r\nhappy is the desire of Yours, etc.,\r\n\r\n_Ramon Blanco_.\r\n\r\n\r\nHe had as travelling companion Don Pedro P. Rojas, already referred\r\nto, and had he chosen he could have left the steamer at Singapore as\r\nRojas did. Not a few of us who saw the vessel leave wished him \"God\r\nspeed.\" But the clerical party were eager for his extermination. He\r\nwas a thorn in the side of monastic sway; he had committed no crime,\r\nbut he was the friars' arch-enemy and _bete noire_. Again the lay\r\nauthorities had to yield to the monks. Dr. Rizal was cabled for to\r\nanswer certain accusations; hence on his landing in the Peninsula he\r\nwas incarcerated in the celebrated fortress of Montjuich (the scene of\r\nso many horrors), pending his re-shipment by the returning steamer. He\r\nreached Manila as a State prisoner in the _Colon_, isolated from all\r\nbut his jailors. It was materially impossible for him to have taken\r\nany part in the rebellion, whatever his sympathies may have been. Yet,\r\nonce more, the wheel of fortune turned against him. Coincidentally the\r\nparish priest of Morong was murdered at the altar whilst celebrating\r\nMass on Christmas Day, 1896. The importunity of the friars could be\r\nno longer resisted; this new calamity seemed to strengthen their\r\ncause. The next day Rizal was brought to trial for _sedition_ and\r\n_rebellion_, before a court-martial composed of eight captains,\r\nunder the presidency of a lieutenant-colonel. No reliable testimony\r\ncould be brought against him. How could it be when, for years, he had\r\nbeen a State prisoner in forced seclusion? He defended himself with\r\nlogical argument. But what mattered? He was condemned beforehand to\r\nignominious death as a traitor, and the decree of execution was one of\r\nPolavieja's foulest acts. During the few days which elapsed between\r\nsentence and death he refused to see any priest but a Jesuit, Padre\r\nFaura, his old preceptor, who hastened his own death by coming from a\r\nsick bed to console the pupil he was so proud of. In his last moments\r\nhis demeanour was in accordance with his oft-quoted saying, \"What is\r\ndeath to me? I have sown the seed; others are left to reap.\" In his\r\ncondemned cell he composed a beautiful poem of 14 verses (\"My last\r\nThought\"), which was found by his wife and published. The following\r\nare the first and last verses.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Mi Ultimo Pensamiento_.\r\n\r\n\r\n    Adios, Patria adorada, region del sol querida,\r\n    Perla del Mar de Oriente, nuestro perdido Eden.\r\n    A darte voy alegre la triste mustia vida,\r\n    Y fuera mas brillante, mas fresca, mas florida,\r\n    Tambien por ti la diera, la diera por tu bien.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n    Adios, padres y hermanos, trozos del alma mia.\r\n    Amigos de la infancia en el perdido hogar.\r\n    Dad gracias que descanso del fatigoso dia;\r\n    Adios, dulce extrangera, mi amiga, mi alegria,\r\n    Adios, queridos seres, morir es descansar.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe woman who had long responded to his love was only too proud to\r\nbear his illustrious name, and in the sombre rays which fell from his\r\nprison grating, the vows of matrimony were given and sanctified with\r\nthe sad certainty of widowhood on the morrow. Fortified by purity of\r\nconscience and the rectitude of his principles, he felt no felon's\r\nremorse, but walked with equanimity to the place of execution. About\r\n2,000 regular and volunteer troops formed the square where he knelt\r\nfacing the seashore, on the blood-stained field of Bagumbayan. After an\r\nofficer had shouted the formula, \"In the name of the King! Whosoever\r\nshall raise his voice to crave clemency for the condemned, shall\r\nsuffer death,\" four bullets, fired from behind by Philippine soldiers,\r\ndid their fatal work. This execution took place at 6 a.m. on December\r\n30, 1896. An immense crowd witnessed, in silent awe, this sacrifice\r\nto priestcraft. The friars, too, were present _en masse_, many of\r\nthem smoking big cigars, jubilant over the extinction of that bright\r\nintellectual light which, alas! can never be rekindled.\r\n\r\nThe circumstances under which Rizal, in his exile, made the\r\nacquaintance of Josephine Taufer, who became his wife, are curious. The\r\naccount was given to me by Mrs. Rizal's foster-father as we crossed the\r\nChina Sea together. The foster-father, who was an American resident in\r\nHong-Kong, found his eyesight gradually failing him. After exhausting\r\nall remedies in that colony, he heard of a famous oculist in Manila\r\nnamed Rizal, a Filipino of reputed Japanese origin. Therefore,\r\nin August, 1894, he went to Manila to seek the great doctor, taking\r\nwith him a Macao servant, his daughter, and a girl whom he had adopted\r\nfrom infancy. The Philippine Archipelago was such a _terra incognita_\r\nto the outside world that little was generally known of it save the\r\ncapital, Manila. When he reached there he learnt, to his dismay,\r\nthat the renowned practitioner was a political exile who lived in\r\nan out-of-the-way place in Mindanao Island. Intent on his purpose,\r\nhe took ship and found the abode of Dr. Rizal. The American had been\r\nforsaken by his daughter in Manila, where she eventually married a\r\nyoung native who had neither craft nor fortune. The adopted daughter,\r\ntherefore, was his companion to Dapitan. When they arrived at the\r\nbungalow the bright eyes of the lovely Josephine interested the doctor\r\nfar more than the sombre diseased organs of her foster-father. The\r\nexile and the maiden, in short, fell in love with each other, and they\r\nmutually vowed never to be parted but by force. The old man's eyes\r\nwere past all cure, and in vain he urged the girl to depart with him;\r\nlove dissented from the proposition, and the patient found his way\r\nback to Manila, and thence to Hong-Kong, with his Macao servant--a\r\nsadder, but a wiser man. The foster-child remained behind to share\r\nthe hut of the political exile. When, an hour after her marriage,\r\nshe became Widow Rizal, her husband's corpse, which had received\r\nsepulture in the cemetery, was guarded by soldiers for four days lest\r\nthe superstitious natives should snatch the body and divide it into\r\na thousand relics of their lamented idol. Then Josephine started\r\noff for the rebel camp at Imus. On her way she was often asked,\r\n\"Who art thou?\" but her answer, \"Lo! I am thy sister, the widow of\r\nRizal!\" not only opened a passage for her, but brought low every head\r\nin silent reverence. Amidst mourning and triumph she was conducted to\r\nthe presence of the rebel commander-in-chief, Emilio Aguinaldo, who\r\nreceived her with the respect due to the sorrowing relict of their\r\ndeparted hero. But the formal tributes of condolence were followed\r\nby great rejoicing in the camp. She was the only free white woman\r\nwithin the rebel lines. They lauded her as though an angelic being\r\nhad fallen from the skies; they sang her praises as if she were a\r\nmodern Joan of Arc sent by heaven to lead the way to victory over\r\nthe banner of Castile. But she chose, for the time being, to follow a\r\nmore womanly vocation, and, having been escorted to San Francisco de\r\nMalabon, she took up her residence in the convent to tend the wounded\r\nfor about three weeks. Then, when the battle of Perez Dasmarinas was\r\nraging, our heroine sallied forth on horseback with a Maeuser rifle\r\nover her shoulder, and--as she stated with pride to a friend of mine\r\nwho interviewed her--she had the satisfaction of shooting dead one\r\nSpanish officer, and then retreated to her convent refuge. Again,\r\nshe was present at the battle of Silan, where her heroic example of\r\ncourage infused new life into her brother rebels. The carnage on both\r\nsides was fearful, but in the end the rebels fell back, and there,\r\nfrom a spot amidst mangled corpses, rivulets of blood, and groans of\r\ndeath, Josephine witnessed many a scene of Spanish barbarity--the\r\nbutchery of old inoffensive men and women, children caught up by\r\nthe feet and dashed against the walls, and the bayonet-charge on the\r\nhost of fugitive innocents. The rebels having been beaten everywhere\r\nwhen Lachambre took the field, Josephine had to follow in their\r\nretreat, and after Imus and Silan were taken, she, with the rest,\r\nhad to flee to another province, tramping through 23 villages on\r\nthe way. She was about to play another _role_, being on the point\r\nof going to Manila to organize a convoy of arms and munitions, when\r\nshe heard that certain Spaniards were plotting against her life. So\r\nshe sought an interview with the Gov.-General, who asked her if she\r\nhad been in the rebel camp at Imus. She replied fearlessly in the\r\naffirmative, and, relying on the security from violence afforded\r\nby her sex and foreign nationality, there passed between her and\r\nthe Gov.-General quite an amusing and piquant colloquy. \"What did\r\nyou go to Imus for?\" inquired the General. \"What did you go there\r\nfor?\" rejoined Josephine. \"To fight,\" said the General. \"So did I,\"\r\nanswered Josephine. \"Will you leave Manila?\" asked the General. \"Why\r\nshould I?\" queried Josephine. \"Well,\" said the General, \"the priests\r\nwill not leave you alone if you stay here, and they will bring false\r\nevidence against you. I have no power to overrule theirs.\" \"Then\r\nwhat is the use of the Gov.-General?\" pursued our heroine; but the\r\nGeneral dismissed the discussion, which was becoming embarrassing,\r\nand resumed it a few days later by calling upon her emphatically to\r\nquit the Colony. At this second interview the General fumed and raged,\r\nand our heroine too stamped her little foot, and, woman-like, avowed\r\n\"she did not care for him; she was not afraid of him.\" It was temerity\r\nborn of inexperience, for one word of command from the General could\r\nhave sent her the way many others had gone, to an unrevealed fate. Thus\r\nmatters waxed hot between her defiance and his forbearance, until\r\nvisions of torture--thumb-screws and bastinado--passed so vividly\r\nbefore her eyes that she yielded, as individual force must, to the\r\ncollective power which rules supreme, and reluctantly consented to\r\nleave the fair Philippine shores in May, 1897, in the s.s. _Yuensang_,\r\nfor a safer resting-place on the British soil of Hong-Kong.\r\n\r\nThe execution of Dr. Rizal was a most impolitic act. It sent into\r\nthe field his brother Pasciano with a large following, who eventually\r\nsucceeded in driving every Spaniard out of their native province of\r\nLa Laguna. They also seized the lake gunboats, took an entire Spanish\r\ngarrison prisoner, and captured a large quantity of stores. Pasciano\r\nrose to the rank of general before the rebellion ended. [183]\r\n\r\nGeneral Fernando Primo de Rivera, Marquis de Estella, arrived in\r\nManila, as the successor of General Camilo Polavieja, in the spring\r\nof 1897. He knew the country and the people he was called upon to\r\npacify, having been Gov.-General there from April, 1880, to March,\r\n1883. A few days after his arrival he issued a proclamation offering\r\nan amnesty to all who would lay down their arms within a prescribed\r\nperiod. Many responded to this appeal, for the crushing defeat of\r\nthe rebels in Cavite Province, accompanied by the ruthless severity\r\nof the soldiery during the last Captain-Generalcy, had damped the\r\nardour of thousands of would-be insurgents. The rebellion was then\r\nconfined to the north of Manila, but, since Aguinaldo had evacuated\r\nCavite and joined forces with Llaneras, the movement was carried far\r\nbeyond the Provinces of Bulacan and Pampanga. Armed mobs had risen\r\nin Pangasinan, Zambales, Ilocos, Nueva Ecija, and Tarlac. Many\r\nvillages were entirely reduced to ashes by them; crops of young\r\nrice too unripe to be useful to anybody were wantonly destroyed;\r\npillage and devastation were resorted to everywhere to coerce the\r\npeaceful inhabitants to join in the movement. On the other hand, the\r\nnerves of the priests were so highly strung that they suspected every\r\nnative, and, by persistently launching false accusations against their\r\nparishioners, they literally made rebels. Hence at Candon (Ilocos Sur),\r\na town of importance on the north-west coast of Luzon, five influential\r\nresidents were simply goaded into rebellion by the frenzied action\r\nof the friars subordinate to the Bishop of Vigan, Father Jose Hevia\r\nde Campomanes. These residents then killed the parish priest, and\r\nwithout arms fled for safety to the mountain ravines. A few months\r\nbefore, at the commencement of the rebellion, this same Austin friar,\r\nFather Rafael Redondo, had ignominiously treated his own and other\r\nnative curates by having them stripped naked and tied down to benches,\r\nwhere he beat them with the prickly tail of the ray-fish to extort\r\nconfessions relating to conspiracy. In San Fernando de la Union the\r\nnative priests Adriano Garces, Mariano Gaerlan, and Mariano Dacanaya\r\nwere tortured with a hot iron applied to their bodies to force a\r\nconfession that they were freemasons. The rebels attacked Bayambang\r\n(Pangasinan), drove out the Spanish garrison, seized the church\r\nand convent in which they had fortified themselves, made prisoner\r\nthe Spanish priest, burnt the Government stores, Court-house, and\r\nSpanish residences, but carefully avoided all interference with the\r\nBritish-owned steam rice-mill and paddy warehouses. Troops were sent\r\nagainst them by special train from Tarlac, and they were beaten out\r\nof the place with a loss of about 100 individuals; but they carried\r\noff their clerical prisoner. General Monet operated in the north\r\nagainst the rebels with Spanish and native auxiliary forces. He\r\nattacked the armed mobs in Zambales Province, where encounters of\r\nminor importance took place almost daily, with no decisive victory\r\nfor either party. He showed no mercy and took no prisoners; his\r\ntroops shot down or bayoneted rebels, non-combatants, women and\r\nchildren indiscriminately. Tillage was carried on at the risk of\r\none's life, for men found going out to their lands were seized as\r\nspies and treated with the utmost severity as possible sympathizers\r\nwith the rebels. He carried this war of extermination up to Ilocos,\r\nwhere, little by little, his forces deserted him. His auxiliaries\r\nwent over to the rebels in groups. Even a few Spaniards passed to\r\nthe other side, and after a protracted struggle which brought no\r\nadvantage to the Government, he left garrisons in several places\r\nand returned to Manila. In Aliaga (Nueva Ecija) the Spaniards had\r\nno greater success. The rebels assembled there in crowds, augmented\r\nby the fugitive mobs from Pangasinan, and took possession of the\r\ntown. The Spaniards, under General Nunez, attacked them on two sides,\r\nand there was fought one of the most desperate battles of the north. It\r\nlasted about six hours: the slaughter on both sides was appalling. The\r\nsite was strewn with corpses, and as the rebels were about to retreat\r\nGeneral Nunez advanced to cut them off, but was so severely wounded\r\nthat he had to relinquish the command on the field. But the flight of\r\nthe insurgents was too far advanced to rally them, and they retired\r\nsouth towards Pampanga.\r\n\r\nIn Tayabas the officiousness of the Governor almost brought him to\r\nan untimely end. Two well-known inhabitants of Pagsanjan (La Laguna)\r\nwere accused of conspiracy, and, without proof, court-martialled\r\nand executed. The Governor went to witness the scene, and returning\r\nthe next day with his official suite, he was waylaid near Lucbang\r\nby a rebel party, who killed one of the officers and wounded the\r\nGovernor. Filipinos returning to Manila were imprisoned without trial,\r\ntortured, and shipped back to Hong-Kong as deck passengers. The wet\r\nseason had fully set in, making warfare in the provinces exceedingly\r\ndifficult for the raw Spanish recruits who arrived to take the place\r\nof the dead, wounded, and diseased. Spain was so hard pressed by\r\nCuban affairs that the majority of these last levies were mere boys,\r\nignorant of the use of arms, ill clad, badly fed, and with months of\r\npay in arrear. Under these conditions they were barely a match for\r\nthe sturdy Islanders, over mountains, through streams, mud-pools,\r\nand paddy-fields. The military hospitals were full; the Spaniards\r\nwere as far off extinguishing the _Katipunan_ as the rebels were\r\nfrom being able to subvert Spanish sovereignty. The rebels held only\r\ntwo impregnable places, namely Angat and San Mateo, but whilst they\r\ncarried on an interminable guerilla warfare they as carefully avoided\r\na pitched battle. The Gov.-General, then, had resort to another edict,\r\ndated July 2, 1897, which read thus:--\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n    _Edict_\r\n\r\n    Don Fernando Primo de Rivera y Sobremonte, Marquis de\r\n    Estella, Governor and Captain-General of the Philippines, and\r\n    Commander-in-Chief of the Army.\r\n\r\n    Whereas the unlimited amplitude given to my former edicts by\r\n    some authorities who are still according the benefits of the\r\n    amnesty to those who present themselves after the expiration of\r\n    the conceded time, imperatively calls for a most absolute and\r\n    positive declaration that there is a limit to clemency and pardon,\r\n    otherwise the indefinite postponement of the application of the\r\n    law may be interpreted as a sign of debility; and\r\n\r\n    Whereas our generosity has been fully appreciated by many who\r\n    have shown signs of repentance by resuming their legal status,\r\n    whilst there are others who abuse our excessive benevolence\r\n    by maintaining their rebellious attitude, and encroach on our\r\n    patience to prolong the resistance; and\r\n\r\n    Whereas it is expedient to abolish the spectacle of a few groups,\r\n    always vanquished whilst committing all sorts of felonies under\r\n    the protection of a fictitious political flag, maintaining a\r\n    state of uneasiness and corruption;\r\n\r\n    Now, therefore, the authorities must adopt every possible means\r\n    of repression, and I, as General-in-Chief of the Army,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n    Order and Command\r\n\r\n    _Article_ 1.--All persons having contracted responsibilities up\r\n    to date on account of the present rebellion who fail to report\r\n    themselves to the authorities or military commanders before the\r\n    10th of July will be pursued and treated as guilty.\r\n\r\n    _Article_ 2.--Commanding generals in the field, military and civil\r\n    governors in districts where the rebels exist, will prohibit all\r\n    inhabitants from leaving the villages and towns, unless under\r\n    absolute necessity for agricultural purposes, or taking care of\r\n    rural properties or other works. Those comprised in the latter\r\n    class will be provided by the municipal captains with a special\r\n    pass, in which will be noted the period of absence, the place to\r\n    be visited, and the road to be taken, always provided that all\r\n    persons absenting themselves from the villages without carrying\r\n    such passes, and all who, having them, deviate from the time,\r\n    road, or place indicated, will be treated as rebels.\r\n\r\n    _Article 3._--After the 10th instant all persons will be required\r\n    to prove their identity by the personal document (_cedula\r\n    personal_), together with the pass above-mentioned, and neither\r\n    the amnesty passes already granted nor any other document will\r\n    have any legal validity.\r\n\r\n    All who contravene these orders will be tried by court-martial.\r\n\r\n    _Fernando Primo de Rivera_.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe indiscreetness of this measure was soon evident. It irritated\r\nthe well-disposed inhabitants, from whom fees were exacted by the\r\nGov.-General's venal subordinates; the rigorous application of the\r\nedict drove many to the enemy's camp, and the rebels responded to\r\nthis document by issuing the following Exhortation in Tagalog dialect,\r\nbearing the pseudonym of \"Malabar.\" It was extensively circulated in\r\nJuly, 1897, but bears no date. The Spanish authorities made strenuous\r\nbut unsuccessful efforts to confiscate it. It is an interesting\r\ndocument because (1) It admits how little territory the _Katipunan_\r\nitself considered under its dominion. (2) It sets forth the sum total\r\nof the rebels' demands at that period. (3) It admits their impotence\r\nto vanquish the loyal forces in open battle.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n    To the Brave Sons of the Philippines\r\n\r\n    The Spaniards have occupied the towns of Cavite Province because we\r\n    found it convenient to evacuate them. We must change our tactics\r\n    as circumstances dictate.\r\n\r\n    We have proved it to be a bad policy to be fortified in one place\r\n    awaiting the enemy's attack. We must take the offensive when we\r\n    get the chance, adopting the Cuban plan of ambush and guerilla\r\n    warfare. In this way we can, for an indefinite period, defy Spain,\r\n    exhaust her resources, and oblige her to surrender from poverty,\r\n    for it must be remembered that the very Spanish newspapers admit\r\n    that each soldier costs a dollar a day, and adding to this\r\n    his passage money, clothing and equipment, the total amounts\r\n    to a considerable sum. Considering that Spanish credit abroad\r\n    is exhausted, that her young men, to avoid conscription, are\r\n    emigrating to France and elsewhere in large numbers, Spain must\r\n    of necessity yield in the end. You already know that Polavieja\r\n    resigned because the Government were unable to send him the\r\n    further 20,000 men demanded. The Cubans, with their guerilla\r\n    system, avoiding encounters unfavourable to themselves, have\r\n    succeeded in wearying the Spaniards, who are dying of fever in\r\n    large numbers. Following this system, it would be quite feasible\r\n    to extend the action of the _Katipunan_ to Ilocos, Pangasinan,\r\n    Cagayan, and other provinces, because our brothers in these places,\r\n    sorely tyrannized by the Spaniards, are prepared to unite with us.\r\n\r\n    The Provinces of Zambales, Tarlac, Tayabas, etc., are already\r\n    under the _Katipunan_ Government, and to complete our success,\r\n    the revolutionary movement should become general, for the ends\r\n    which we all so ardently desire, namely:\r\n\r\n    (1) Expulsion of the friars and restitution to the townships\r\n    of the lands which the friars have appropriated, dividing the\r\n    incumbencies held by them, as well as the episcopal sees equally\r\n    between Peninsular and Insular secular priests.\r\n\r\n    (2) Spain must concede to us, as she has to Cuba, Parliamentary\r\n    representation, freedom of the Press, toleration of all religious\r\n    sects, laws common with hers, and administrative and economic\r\n    autonomy.\r\n\r\n    (3) Equality in treatment and pay between Peninsular and Insular\r\n    civil servants.\r\n\r\n    (4) Restitution of all lands appropriated by the friars to the\r\n    townships, or to the original owners, or in default of finding\r\n    such owners, the State is to put them up to public auction in\r\n    small lots of a value within the reach of all and payable within\r\n    four years, the same as the present State lands.\r\n\r\n    (5) Abolition of the Government authorities' power to banish\r\n    citizens, as well as all unjust measures against Filipinos;\r\n    legal equality for all persons, whether Peninsular or Insular,\r\n    under the Civil as well as the Penal Code.\r\n\r\n    The war must be prolonged to give the greatest signs of vitality\r\n    possible, so that Spain may be compelled to grant our demands,\r\n    otherwise she will consider us an effete race and curtail, rather\r\n    than extend, our rights.\r\n\r\n    _Malabar_.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nShortly after this Emilio Aguinaldo, the recognized leader of the\r\nrebels, issued a _Manifiesto_ in somewhat ambiguous terms which might\r\nimply a demand for independence. In this document he says:--\r\n\r\n\r\n    We aspire to the glory of obtaining the liberty, _independence_,\r\n    and honour of the country.... We aspire to a Government\r\n    representing all the live forces of the country, in which the most\r\n    able, the most worthy in virtue and talent, may take part without\r\n    distinction of birth, fortune, or race. We desire that no monk,\r\n    or friar, shall sully the soil of any part of the Archipelago,\r\n    nor that there shall exist any convent, etc., etc.\r\n\r\n\r\nEvery month brought to light fresh public exhortations, edicts, and\r\nproclamations from one side or the other, of which I have numerous\r\nprinted copies before me now. About this time the famous Philippine\r\npainter, Juan Luna (_vide_ p. 195), was released after six months'\r\nimprisonment as a suspect. He left Manila _en route_ for Madrid in\r\nthe Spanish mail-steamer _Covadonga_ in the first week of July and\r\nreturned to Manila the next year (November 1898).\r\n\r\nIn the field there were no great victories to record, for the rebels\r\nconfined themselves exclusively to harassing the Spanish forces\r\nand then retreating to the mountains. To all appearances trade in\r\nManila and throughout the Islands was little affected by the war,\r\nand as a matter of fact, the total exports showed a fair average\r\nwhen compared with previous years. The sugar production was, however,\r\nslightly less than in 1896, owing to a scarcity of hands, because, in\r\nthe ploughing season, the young labourers in Negros were drafted off\r\nto military service. Total imports somewhat increased, notwithstanding\r\nthe imposition of a special 6 per cent. _ad valorem_ tax.\r\n\r\nBut the probability of an early pacification of the Islands was\r\nremote. By the unscrupulous abuse of their functions the volunteers\r\nwere obliging the well-intentioned natives to forsake their allegiance,\r\nand General Primo de Rivera was constrained to issue a decree, dated\r\nAugust 6, forbidding all persons in military service to plunder,\r\nor intimidate, or commit acts of violence on persons, or in their\r\nhouses, or ravish women, under penalty of death. In the same month\r\nthe General commissioned a Filipino, Don Pedro Alejandro Paterno, to\r\nnegotiate terms of capitulation with the rebels. By dint of bribes and\r\nliberal expenditure of money (_vide_ Paterno's own letter at p. 410)\r\nPaterno induced the minor chiefs in arms to accept, in principle,\r\nthe proposal of peace on the basis of reforms and money. Paterno was\r\nappointed by the Gov.-General sole mediator in the discussion of the\r\nterms to be made with Emilio Aguinaldo, and the General's private\r\nsecretary, Don Niceto Mayoral, was granted special powers to arrange\r\nwith Paterno the details of the proposed treaty. From Paterno's lips\r\nI have the following account of the negotiations:--\r\n\r\nOn August 4, 1897, he started on a series of difficult journeys\r\ninto the rebel camps to negotiate severally with the chiefs, who,\r\none after the other, stoutly refused to capitulate. On August 9 he\r\ninterviewed Aguinaldo at Biac-na-bato, situated in the mountains, about\r\na mile north of San Miguel de Mayumo (Bulacan). Aguinaldo withheld his\r\ndecision until Paterno could report to him the definite opinions of his\r\ngenerals. Thereupon Paterno returned to the rebel chiefs, some of whom\r\nstill tenaciously held out, whilst others were willing to capitulate,\r\nsubject to Aguinaldo's approval. Paterno's mission was daily becoming\r\nmore perilous, for the irreconcilable leaders regarded him as an\r\nevil genius sent to sow discord in the camp. After many delays the\r\nprincipal warriors assembled at Biac-na-bato on October 31 and held a\r\ngreat meeting, which Paterno, who is a fluent speaker, attended and\r\nharangued his audience in eloquent phrases, but to no purpose. His\r\nposition was now a somewhat critical one. Several of the chiefs assumed\r\nsuch a defiant attitude that but for the clement nature of Aguinaldo,\r\nPaterno might never have returned to tell the tale. They clamorously\r\ninsisted on their resolution to fight. Then Paterno adroitly brought\r\nmatters to a crisis in a bold peroration which changed the whole\r\nscene. \"Capitulate,\" he exclaimed, \"or get hence and vanquish the\r\nenemy! Is victory to be gained in this hiding-place?\" Piqued by\r\nthis fearless challenge, General Natividad immediately sallied\r\nforth with his troops and encountered the Spaniards for the last\r\ntime. His dead body was brought into the camp, and, in the shades of\r\nnight, with sombre lights flickering around them, in the presence of\r\nNatividad's bleeding corpse, again Paterno exhorted them to reflect on\r\nthe prospects in the field and the offer of capitulation. Impressed\r\nby the lugubrious scene, Aguinaldo yielded, and the next day peace\r\nnegotiations were opened. But other difficulties intervened. Aguinaldo\r\nhaving heard that a subordinate chief was conspiring to force his hand\r\nto capitulate, abruptly cast aside the papers, declaring that he would\r\nnever brook coercion. The deadlock lasted a whole day, but at length\r\nAguinaldo signed conditions, which Paterno conveyed to General Primo\r\nde Rivera at San Fernando (Pampanga). The willingness to capitulate\r\nwas by no means unanimous. Paterno was forewarned that on his route\r\na party of 500 Irreconcilables were waiting to intercept and murder\r\nhim, so to evade them he had to hide in a wood. Fifteen minutes' delay\r\nwould have cost him his life. Even a Spanish colonel for some occult\r\nreason sought to frustrate the peace negotiations by falsely reporting\r\nto General Primo de Rivera that Paterno was inciting the rebels to\r\nwarfare. But the General believed in Paterno's good faith, although\r\nhe declared the terms proposed unacceptable, and in like manner three\r\nother amended proposals were rejected, until finally the fifth document\r\nwas accepted as tantamount to a Protocol of Peace to serve as a basis\r\nfor the treaty. Here ends Paterno's verbal declaration.\r\n\r\nThe Protocol was signed in duplicate by Emilio Aguinaldo of the one\r\npart, and Pedro A. Paterno, as Peacemaker, of the other part. One\r\ncopy was archived in the office of the _Gobierno General_ in Manila,\r\n[184] and the other was remitted to the Home Government with a despatch\r\nfrom the Gov.-General.\r\n\r\nAfter many consultations and much deliberation it was decided at\r\na Cabinet meeting to approve unreservedly of the negotiations,\r\nand to that effect a cablegram was sent to General Primo de Rivera\r\nfully empowering him to conclude a treaty of peace on the basis\r\nof the Protocol. Meanwhile, it soon became evident that there\r\nwere three distinct interests at stake, namely, those of Spain\r\nand the Spanish people, those of the friars, and the claims of the\r\nrebels. Consequently the traditional feud between the Archbishop of\r\nManila and the Captain-General was revived.\r\n\r\nGeneral Primo de Rivera in his despatch urged the Madrid Government to\r\ngrant certain reforms, in any case, which could not fail to affect the\r\nhitherto independent position of the friars in governmental affairs. He\r\nalso drew the attention of the Government to the defenceless\r\ncondition of the capital in the event of a foreign attack (_vide_\r\nSenate speeches reported in the _Diario de las Sesiones_, Madrid,\r\n1899 and 1900). The friars were exceedingly wroth, and combined to\r\ndefeat the General's efforts to come to an understanding with the\r\nrebels. They secretly paid natives to simulate the _Katipunan_ in\r\nthe provinces, and the plot only came to light when these unfortunate\r\ndupes fell into the hands of the military authorities and confessed\r\nwhat had happened. Nevertheless, the General pursued the negotiations\r\nwith Paterno as intermediary. Aguinaldo's original demand was for a\r\ntotal indemnity of P3,000,000, but, in the course of the negotiations\r\nalluded to, it was finally reduced to P1,700,000, inclusive of P800,000\r\nto be paid to Aguinaldo on his retirement from the Colony.\r\n\r\nThe terms of the Protocol of Peace having been mutually agreed upon,\r\na treaty, known as the _Pacto de Biac-na-bato_, [185] is alleged to\r\nhave been signed at Biac-na-bato on December 14, 1897, between Emilio\r\nAguinaldo and others of the one part, and Pedro A. Paterno, as attorney\r\nfor the Captain-General, acting in the name of the Spanish Government,\r\nof the other part. Under this treaty the rebels undertook to deliver up\r\ntheir arms and ammunition of all kinds to the Spaniards; to evacuate\r\nthe places held by them; to conclude an armistice for three years for\r\nthe application and development of the _reforms to be introduced_\r\nby the other part, and not to conspire against Spanish sovereignty\r\nin the Islands, nor aid or abet any movement calculated to counteract\r\nthose reforms. Emilio Aguinaldo and 34 other leaders undertook to quit\r\nthe Philippine Islands and not return thereto until so authorized by\r\nthe Spanish Government, in consideration whereof the above-mentioned\r\nP800,000 was to be paid as follows:--P400,000 in a draft on Hong-Kong\r\nto be delivered to Aguinaldo on his leaving Biac-na-bato [This draft\r\nwas, in fact, delivered to him]; P200,000 payable to Aguinaldo as soon\r\nas he should send a telegram to the revolutionary general in command\r\nat Biac-na-bato, ordering him to hand over the rebels' arms to the\r\nCaptain-General's appointed commissioner [This telegram was sent],\r\nand the final P200,000 immediately after the singing of the _Te Deum_\r\nwhich would signify an official recognition of peace.\r\n\r\n_It was further alleged_ that on behalf of the Spanish Government\r\nmany radical reforms and conditions were agreed to (outside the\r\nTreaty of Biac-na-bato), almost amounting to a total compliance\r\nwith the demands of the rebels. But no evidence whatever has been\r\nadduced to confirm this allegation. Indeed it is a remarkable fact\r\nthat neither in the Madrid parliamentary papers (to copies of which\r\nI have referred), nor in the numerous rebel proclamations and edicts,\r\nnor in the published correspondence of Pedro A. Paterno, is even the\r\nfull text of the treaty given. It is singular that the rebels should\r\nhave abstained from publishing to the world those precise terms which\r\nthey say were accepted and not fulfilled by the Spanish Government,\r\nwhich denies their existence.\r\n\r\nWhatever reforms might have been promised would have been purely\r\ngovernmental matters which required no mediator for their execution;\r\nbut as to the money payments to be made, Paterno was to receive them\r\nfrom the Government and distribute them. An Agreement to this effect\r\nwas, therefore, signed by General Primo de Rivera and Pedro A. Paterno\r\nin the following terms, viz.:--\r\n\r\n    In the peace proposals presented by the sole mediator, Don Pedro\r\n    Alejandro Paterno, in the name and on behalf of the rebels in arms,\r\n    and in the Peace Protocol which was agreed to and submitted to His\r\n    Majesty's Government, _which approved of the same_, there exists\r\n    a principal clause relating to the sums of money which were to be\r\n    handed over to the rebels and their families as indemnity for the\r\n    loss of their goods consequent on the war, which sums amounted to\r\n    a total of P1,700,000, which the mediator, Senor Paterno, was to\r\n    distribute absolutely at his discretion, but the payment of the\r\n    said sum will have to be subject to the conditions proposed by\r\n    the representative of the Government, H.E. the General-in-Chief of\r\n    this Army. These conditions were agreed to be as follows, viz.:--\r\n\r\n    (1) For the rebels in arms a draft for the sum of P400,000 will\r\n    be handed to Senor Paterno, payable in Hong-Kong, as well as\r\n    two cheques for P200,000 each, payable only on the condition\r\n    of the Agreement being fulfilled on the other part. (2) For\r\n    the families of those who were not rebels in arms, or engaged\r\n    in rebellion, but who have likewise suffered the evils of war,\r\n    the balance of the sum offered shall be paid in three equal\r\n    instalments, the last to be paid six months after the date on\r\n    which the _Te Deum_ shall be sung, assuming the peace to become\r\n    an accomplished fact. Peace shall be held to be effectively\r\n    concluded if, during the interval of these instalment periods,\r\n    no party of armed rebels, with recognized leader, shall exist,\r\n    and if no secret society shall have been discovered as existing\r\n    here or abroad with the proved object of conspiracy by those who\r\n    benefit by these payments. The representative of the rebels, Don\r\n    Pedro Alejandro Paterno, and the representative of the Government,\r\n    the Captain-General Don Fernando Primo de Rivera, agree to the\r\n    above conditions, in witness whereof each representative now\r\n    signs four copies of the same tenour and effect, one being for\r\n    the Government, another for the archives of the Captain-Generalcy,\r\n    and one copy each for the said representatives.\r\n\r\n     [186]Done in Manila on the 15th of December, 1897.\r\n\r\n\r\n    _Fernando Primo de Rivera_,\r\n    _The General-in-Chief._\r\n    _Pedro A. Paterno_,\r\n    _The Mediator._\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the course of a few days a military deputation was sent by the\r\nGov.-General, under the leadership of Lieut.-Colonel Primo de Rivera,\r\nto meet Aguinaldo and his 34 companions-in-arms at a place agreed\r\nupon in the Province of Pangasinan. They had a repast together,\r\nand Aguinaldo called for cheers for Spain, in which all heartily\r\njoined. Thence they proceeded in vehicles to Sual to await the arrival\r\nof the s.s. _Uranus_, in which they embarked for Hong-Kong on Monday,\r\nDecember 27, 1897. Armed rebel troops were stationed at several places\r\nall along the route to Sual, ready to avenge any act of treachery,\r\nwhilst two Spanish generals were held as hostages at the rebel camp\r\nat Biac-na-bato until Aguinaldo cabled his safe arrival in Hong-Kong.\r\n\r\nAguinaldo had very rightly stipulated that a Spanish officer of high\r\nrank should accompany him and his followers to Hong-Kong as a guarantee\r\nagainst foul play. The Gov.-General, therefore, sent with them his\r\ntwo nephews, Lieut.-Colonel Primo de Rivera and Captain Celestino\r\nEspinosa, and Major Antonio Pezzi. Aguinaldo and eight other chiefs,\r\nnamely, Gregorio H. del Pilar, Wenceslao Vinegra, Vito Belarmino,\r\nMariano Llaneras, Antonio Montenegro, Luis Viola, Manuel Fino, and\r\nEscolastico Viola, stayed at the Hong-Kong Hotel, whilst the remainder\r\ntook up their abode elsewhere in the city. Aguinaldo cashed his draft\r\nfor P400,000, but as to the other two instalments of the P800,000,\r\nthe Spanish Government defaulted.\r\n\r\nThere was great rejoicing in Manila, in Madrid, and in several Spanish\r\ncities, and fetes were organized to celebrate the conclusion of\r\npeace. In Manila particularly, amidst the pealing of bells and strains\r\nof music, unfeigned enthusiasm and joy were everywhere evident. It was\r\na tremendous relief after sixteen months of persecution, butchery,\r\ntorture, and pecuniary losses. General Primo de Rivera received\r\nthe thanks of the Government, whilst the Queen-Regent bestowed on\r\nhim the Grand Cross of San Fernando, with the pension of 10,000\r\npesetas (nominal value L400). But no one in Spain and few in Manila\r\nas yet could foresee how the fulfilment of the Agreement would be\r\nbungled. According to a letter of Pedro A. Paterno, dated March 7,\r\n1898, published in _El Liberal_ of Madrid on June 17, 1898, it would\r\nappear that (up to the former date) the Spanish Government had failed\r\nto make any payment to Paterno on account of the P900,000, balance of\r\nindemnity, for distribution according to Clause (2) of the Agreement\r\nset forth on the preceding page. The letter says:--\r\n\r\n\r\n    As a matter of justice, I ought to have received the two\r\n    instalments, amounting to P600,000. Why is this obligation not\r\n    carried out, and why has General Primo de Rivera not followed my\r\n    advice by arresting Yocson and his followers from the 5th of last\r\n    February? I have my conscience clear respecting the risings in\r\n    Zambales and Pangasinan Provinces and those about to take place\r\n    in La Laguna and Tayabas.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhatever were the means employed, the rebellion was disorganized for a\r\nwhile, but the Spanish authorities had not the tact to follow up this\r\n_coup_ by temperate and conciliatory measures towards their wavering\r\nquondam foes. Persons who had been implicated in the rebellion\r\nwere re-arrested on trivial trumped-up charges and imprisoned,\r\nwhilst others were openly treated as seditious suspects. The priests\r\nstarted a furious campaign of persecution, and sought, by all manner\r\nof intrigue, to destroy the compact, which they feared would operate\r\nagainst themselves. More executions took place. Instead of the expected\r\ngeneral amnesty, only a few special pardons were granted.\r\n\r\nThere had been over two months of nominal peace; the rebels had\r\ndelivered up their arms, and there was nothing to indicate an\r\nintention to violate their undertakings. Primo de Rivera, who\r\nbelieved the rebellion to be fast on the wane, shipped back to\r\nSpain 7,000 troops. The Madrid Government at once appointed to vacant\r\nbishoprics two friars of the Orders obnoxious to the people, and it is\r\ninconceivable that such a step would have been so speedily taken if\r\nthere were any truth in the rebels' pretension that the expulsion of\r\nthe friars had been promised to them. Rafael Comenge, the President\r\nof the Military Club, was rewarded with the Grand Cross of Military\r\nMerit for the famous speech which he had delivered at the Club. It\r\nwas generally lauded by Spaniards, whilst it filled all classes of\r\nnatives with indignation. Here are some extracts from this oration:--\r\n\r\n\r\n    You arrive in time; the cannibals of the forest are still there;\r\n    the wild beast hides in his lair (_bravo_); the hour has come\r\n    to finish with the savages; wild beasts should be exterminated;\r\n    weeds should be extirpated. (_Great applause_.) Destruction\r\n    is the purport of war; its civilizing virtue acts like the\r\n    hot iron on a cancer, destroying the corrupt tendons in order\r\n    to arrive at perfect health. No pardon! (_Very good, very\r\n    good_.) Destroy! Kill! Do not pardon, for this prerogative belongs\r\n    to the monarch, not to the army. . . . From that historical,\r\n    honoured, and old land Spain, which we all love with delirious joy,\r\n    no words of peace come before this treason, but words of vigour\r\n    and of justice, which, according to public opinion, is better\r\n    in quality than in quantity. (_Frantic applause, several times\r\n    repeated, which drowned the voice of the orator_.) Soldiers! you\r\n    are the right arm of Spain. Execute; exterminate if it be\r\n    necessary. Amputate the diseased member to save the body;\r\n    cut off the dry branches which impede the circulation of the\r\n    sap, in order that the tree may again bring forth leaves and\r\n    flowers. (_Senor Penaranda interposed, shouting, \"That is the\r\n    way to speak!\" Frantic applause_.)\r\n\r\n\r\nThirty thousand pesos were subscribed at the Military Club for the\r\nbenefit of General Primo de Rivera. Admiral Patricio Montojo, who had\r\nco-operated against the rebels by firing a few shots at them when they\r\noccupied the coast towns of Cavite Province and transporting troops\r\nto and from Manila, was the recipient of a sword of honour on March\r\n17, 1898. It was presented to him, on behalf of the Military Club,\r\nby Senor Comenge (who escaped from Manila as soon as the Americans\r\nentered the port) as a \"perpetual remembrance of the triumph of our\r\nships off the coast of Cavite,\" although no deed of glory on the\r\npart of the fleet, during the period of the rebellion, had come to\r\nthe knowledge of the general public.\r\n\r\nThe reforms alluded to in the treaty made with the rebel chiefs were\r\na subject of daily conversation; but when the _Diario de Manila _\r\npublished an article on March 17, demanding autonomy for the Islands\r\nand urging the immediate application of those reforms, General\r\nPrimo de Rivera suspended the publication of the newspaper. Some\r\nwere inquisitive enough to ask, Has a treaty been signed or a trick\r\nbeen played upon the rebels? The treatment of the people was far from\r\nbeing in harmony with the spirit of a treaty of peace.\r\n\r\nThe expatriated ex-rebels became alarmed by the non-receipt of the\r\nindemnity instalment and the news from their homes. A committee of\r\nFilipinos, styled _La Junta Patriotica,_ was formed in Hong-Kong. They\r\nwere in frequent communication with their friends in the Islands. The\r\nseed of discontent was again germinating under the duplicity of the\r\nSpanish lay and clerical authorities. Thousands were ready to take\r\nthe field again, but their chiefs were absent, their arms surrendered,\r\nand the rebellion disorganized. Here and there roving parties appeared,\r\nbut having no recognized leaders, their existence did not invalidate\r\nthe treaty. The Spaniards, indeed, feigned to regard them only\r\nas a remnant of the rebels who had joined the pre-existing brigand\r\nbands. The volunteers were committing outrages which might have driven\r\nthe people again into open revolt, and General Primo de Rivera had,\r\nat least, the sagacity to recognize the evil which was apparent to\r\neverybody. The volunteers and guerilla battalions were consequently\r\ndisbanded, not a day too soon for the tranquillity of the city. On\r\nMarch 25, the tragedy of the _Calle de Camba _took place. This street\r\nlies just off the _Calle de San Fernando _in Binondo, a few hundred\r\nyards from the river. In a house frequented by seafaring men a large\r\nnumber of Visayan sailors had assembled and were, naturally, discussing\r\nthe topics of the day with the warmth of expression and phraseology\r\npeculiar to their race, when a passer-by, who overheard the talk,\r\ninformed the police. The civil guard at once raided the premises,\r\naccused these sailors of conspiracy, and, without waiting for proof\r\nor refutation, shot down all who could not escape. The victims of this\r\noutrage numbered over 70. The news dismayed the native population. The\r\nfact could no longer be doubted that a reign of terrorism and revenge\r\nhad been initiated with impunity, under the assumption that the\r\nrebellion was broken for many a year to come. How the particulars of\r\nthis crime were related by the survivors to their fellow-islanders we\r\ncannot know, but it is a coincidental fact that only now the flame of\r\nrebellion spread to the southern Island of Cebu. For over a generation\r\nthe Cebuanos around Talisay, Minglanilla, and Talambau had sustained\r\na dispute with the friars respecting land-tenure. From time to time\r\nprocurators of the Law Court secretly took up the Cebuanos' cause,\r\nand one of them, Florencio Gonzalez, was cast into prison and slowly\r\ndone to death. This event, which happened almost coincidentally with\r\nthe _Calle de Camba_ tragedy, excited the Cebuanos to the utmost\r\ndegree. Nine days after that unfortunate episode, on April 3, 1898,\r\na party of about 5,000 disaffected natives made a raid on the city of\r\nCebu. The leaders were armed with rifles, but the rank-and-file carried\r\nonly bowie-knives. About 4 p.m. all the forces which could be mustered\r\nin the city went out against the rebels, who overwhelmed the loyalists,\r\ncutting some to pieces, whilst the remainder hastened back to the\r\ncity in great disorder. But, instead of following up their victory,\r\nthe half-resolute rioters camped near Guadalupe for the night. At\r\n5 a.m. on April 4 they marched upon the city. Peaceful inhabitants\r\nfled before the motley, yelling crowd of men, women and children\r\nwho swarmed into the streets, armed with bowie-knives and sticks,\r\ndemanding food and other trifles. The terrified Spanish volunteers,\r\nafter their defeat, took refuge in the _Cotta de San Pedro _(the\r\nFort), where the Governor, General Montero, joined them, and ordered\r\nall foreigners to do the same. Later on the foreigners were permitted\r\nto return to their residences. Amidst the confusion which prevailed,\r\nthe flight of peaceful citizens, the street-fighting, and the moans of\r\nthe dying, the rebels helped themselves freely to all they wanted. The\r\nmob of both sexes told the townspeople that they (the rioters) had\r\nnothing to fear, as _anting-anting _wafers (q.v.) had been served\r\nout to them. The rebels had cut the Cebu-Tuburan telegraph-wires\r\n(_vide_ p. 267), but in the meantime three small coasting steamers\r\nhad been despatched to Yloilo, Yligan, and another port to demand\r\nreinforcements. The next day, at sunrise, the rebels attempted\r\nto reach the Fort, but were fired upon from the Governor's house,\r\nwhich is situated in front of it, compelling them to withdraw along\r\nthe shore road, where the gunboat _Maria Cristina _opened fire on\r\nthem. The rebels then retreated to the Chinese quarter of Lutao,\r\naround the Cathedral and the Santo Nino Church. The Spaniards remained\r\nunder cover whilst the mob held possession of the whole city except the\r\nFort, Government House, the College, the churches, and the foreigners\r\nhouses. During the whole day there was an incessant fusillade, the\r\nrebels' chief stronghold being the Recoleto Convent. Groups of them\r\nwere all over the place, plundering the shops and Spanish houses and\r\noffices. On April 5 a small force of Spanish regulars, volunteers,\r\nand sailors made a sortie and fired on the insurgents in Lutao from\r\nlong range. They soon retired, however, as the Fort was in danger of\r\nbeing attacked from another side. The same afternoon the steamer sent\r\nto Yligan for troops returned with 240 on board. During the night the\r\nSpanish troops ventured into the open and shots were exchanged. On\r\nApril 6 the _Venus_ arrived with 50 soldiers from Yloilo and was at\r\nonce sent on to Bojol Island in search of rice and cattle, which were\r\ndifficult to procure as that island was also in revolt. Native women\r\nwere not interfered with by either party, nor were the foreigners,\r\nmany of whom took refuge at the British Consulate. The rebels wished\r\nto advance from Lutao, but were kept back by the fire from the gunboat\r\n_Maria Cristina_. The Spanish troops did not care to venture past a\r\nblock of buildings in which were the offices and stores of a British\r\nfirm. On April 7 the merchant steamer _Churruca_ arrived with troops,\r\nand in a couple of hours was followed by the cruiser _Don Juan de\r\nAustria_, also bringing reinforcements under the command of General\r\nTejeiro (a former Governor of Cebu Is.). The total fresh troops\r\namounted to about 500 men of the 73rd Native Regiment and Spanish\r\n_cazadores_. Whilst these troops were landing, many of the rebels\r\nhastened out of the city towards San Nicolas. General Montero and\r\nthe Spanish refugees then emerged from the _cotta_. After General\r\nTejeiro had strategically deployed his troops, a squad of them,\r\ncrossing the General Lono Square (now called _Plaza de Rizal_)\r\ndrove the rebels before them and dislodged them from the vicinity\r\nof the Recoleto Convent. At the same time the rebels were attacked\r\nat the _mestizo_ quarter called the Parian and at Tiniago, whence\r\nthey had to retreat, with severe loss, towards San Nicolas, which\r\npractically adjoins Cebu and is only separated therefrom by a narrow\r\nriver. Simultaneously, the _Don Juan de Austria_ threw a shell into\r\nthe corner house of the (chiefly Chinese) shopping-quarter, Lutao,\r\nwhich killed several Chinese and set fire to the house. The flames,\r\nhowever, did not catch the adjoining property, so the troops burst open\r\nthe doors, poured petroleum on the goods found therein, and caused\r\nthe fire to extend until the whole quarter was, as I saw it, a mass\r\nof charred ruins with only the stone walls remaining. To complete\r\nthe destruction of Lutao, once a busy bazaar, situated in that part\r\nof the city immediately facing the sea, another bomb was thrown into\r\nthe centre. The troops then marched to San Nicolas, and a third shell\r\nfired at the retreating enemy entered and completely destroyed a large\r\nprivate residence. An attempt was made to procure supplies from the\r\nlittle Island of Magtan, which lies only half a mile off the coast\r\nof Cebu, but the expedition had to return without having been able\r\nto effect a landing at the capital town of Opon, which had risen in\r\nrebellion. On April 8 the loyal troops continued their pursuit of the\r\nrebels, who suffered severe losses at San Nicolas and Pili, on the road\r\nsouth of Cebu city. The corpses collected in the suburbs were carted\r\ninto the city, where, together with those lying about the streets,\r\nthey were piled into heaps, partly covered with petroleum-bathed logs,\r\nand ignited. The stench was very offensive for some hours, especially\r\nfrom a huge burning pile topped with a dead white horse in the General\r\nLono Square. Practically the whole of the east coast of the island\r\nhad risen against the Spaniards, but the rebels were careful not to\r\ninterfere with foreigners when they could distinguish them as such. A\r\nlarge force of insurgents made another stand at Labangan, where they\r\nwere almost annihilated; it is estimated they left quite a thousand\r\ndead on the field. The loyal troops followed up the insurgents towards\r\nthe mountain region, whilst the _Don Juan de Austria_ cruised down\r\nthe coast with the intention of bombarding any town which might be in\r\nrebel hands. The material losses in Cebu amounted to about P1,725,000\r\nin Lutao, represented by house property of Chinese and half-castes\r\nand their cash and stock-in-trade. The \"Compania General de Tabacos\"\r\nlost about P30,000 in cash in addition to the damage done to their\r\noffices and property. Rich natives and Chinese lost large sums of\r\nmoney, the total of which cannot be ascertained. From the Recoleto\r\nConvent P19,000 in cash were stolen, and there, as well as in many of\r\nthe Spanish residences, everything valuable and easily removable was\r\ncarried off; but whether all this pillage was committed by the rebels\r\nalone must ever remain a mystery. The only foreigner who lost his life\r\nwas my late Italian friend Signor Stancampiano, who is supposed to have\r\ndied of shock, for when I last saw him he was hopelessly ill. As usual,\r\na considerable number of well-known residents of the city were arrested\r\nand charged with being the prime movers in these doleful events.\r\n\r\nUpon the hills on the west coast of Cebu, near Toledo town,\r\nsome American friends of mine experienced a series of thrilling\r\nadventures. Mr. and Mrs. Wilson, mother and son, to whom I am indebted\r\nfor their generous hospitality, resided on a large sugar-estate at\r\nCalumampao, of which Mr. Wilson was part owner. They were, naturally,\r\nin ignorance of what had taken place in Cebu City. The rebellion spread\r\nto their district, and many of the natives on and about the estate were\r\neager to join in the movement. Mr. Wilson did his utmost to point out\r\nto them the futility of the attempt, but they indulged in all sorts of\r\nsuperstitions about the invulnerability of their chief, Claudio, and\r\nthe charm attached to a red flag he carried, and they were determined\r\nto take their chance with him. On April 19 an insurgent force came on\r\nto the plantation, compelled the labourers to join their standard, and\r\ncoolly quartered themselves in the out-buildings and warehouses. They\r\ndid no harm to the Wilsons, but they kidnapped a Spanish gentleman who\r\nlived close by, and shot him, in spite of Mr. Wilson's entreaties to\r\nspare his life. The insurgents moved off, taking with them the estate\r\nhands, and in a couple of days a company of Spanish soldiers, under the\r\ncommand of Captain Suarez, arrived at the estate-house. The officer\r\nwas very affable, and Mr. and Mrs. Wilson treated him as hospitably\r\nas they did all their friends and European passers-by. Naturally\r\nthe conversation fell on the all-absorbing topic of the day and the\r\nobject of his mission. After he and his men had been well refreshed\r\nthey started down the hill to meet some cavalry reinforcements, and,\r\nas the Wilsons watched their departure, to their astonishment they\r\nsaw Claudio, at the head of 200 rebels, rushing down the hill with\r\nthe red flag floating in the air. Simultaneously a body of Spanish\r\nhorse approached through the valley; Claudio and his followers, caught\r\nbetween the Spanish cavalry and infantry, retreated to a storehouse\r\nin the valley. The result was that some 40 rebels were killed,\r\nothers taken prisoners, and the remainder escaped into the planted\r\nfields. Every leader was killed, and every peaceful native whom the\r\nSpaniards met on their way was unmercifully treated. Mr. Wilson was\r\nthen asked to go on board a Spanish vessel, and when he complied he\r\nwas charged with being in league with the rebels. He was allowed to\r\nreturn to shore to fetch his mother--a highly-educated, genial old\r\nlady--and when they both went on board they found there two Englishmen\r\nas prisoners. Their guest of a few days previous treated them most\r\nshamefully. When they were well on the voyage to Cebu the prisoners\r\nwere allowed to be on the upper deck, and Mrs. Wilson was permitted\r\nto use an armchair. The soldiers insulted them, and, leaning their\r\nbacks against Mrs. Wilson's chair, some sang ribald songs, whilst\r\nothers debated whether their captives would be shot on the beach or\r\nat the _Cotta_ in Cebu. Sometimes they would draw their swords and\r\nlook viciously towards them. At last, after a series of intimidations,\r\nthey reached Cebu, where, after being detained on board several hours,\r\nthey were all taken before the Governor and the Chief Justice, and\r\nwere only saved from further miseries through the intercession of\r\nthe American Vice-Consul, who, by the way, was an Englishman. War\r\nhad just been declared between America and Spain (April 23, 1898),\r\nand the estate had to be left to the mercy of the rebels, whilst my\r\nfriends took passage to Singapore on the _Gulf of Martaban_.\r\n\r\nAll immediate danger having now been dispelled, the Spaniards solaced\r\nthemselves with the sweets of revenge. A Spanish functionary (who\r\nwith his wife and brother's family were well known to me for several\r\nyears) caused the soldiers to raid private houses, and bring out\r\nnative families by force into the public square, or conduct them to\r\nthe cemetery on the Guadalupe road, where they were shot in batches\r\nwithout inquiry and cremated. The heartrending scenes and wailing\r\nof the people failed to turn their persecutor from his purpose,\r\nsave in one case--that of a colleague, who, wearing his chain of\r\noffice, stepped forward and successfully begged for his life. A low\r\nestimate of this official's victims is 200. The motive for his awful\r\ncrime was greed, for he formally confiscated his victims' goods and\r\nshipped them off daily in schooners to Yloilo. His ill-gotten gains\r\nwould have been greater but for the action of the Governor, who,\r\nfearing that retribution might fall on his own head as the highest\r\nauthority, ordered his guilty subordinate to appear before him, and\r\nin the presence of Filipinos he reprimanded him, boxed his ears,\r\nand commanded him to quit the island within a given period under\r\npain of death. The Governor's indignation was evidently feigned,\r\nfor he very shortly availed himself of an altogether novel means\r\nof terrorism. Sedition was smouldering throughout the island, but\r\nafter the events of April the Spaniards seemed too daunted to take\r\nthe field against the Cebuanos. The Christian Governor, therefore,\r\ntook into his service a Mindanao Mahometan, Rajahmudah Datto Mandi, and\r\nhis band of about 100 Samal Moros to overrun the island and punish the\r\nnatives. This chief, with his warriors, had been called from Zamboanga\r\n(Mindanao Is.) to Yloilo by General Rios, who immediately commissioned\r\nhim to Cebu in the month of July, 1898. On his arrival there he at once\r\nstarted his campaign under the auspices of the Governor, who granted\r\nhim full liberty to dispose of the lives and property of the Cebuanos\r\nto his heart's content, and as proof of the accomplishment of his gory\r\nmission he brought in and presented to his patron the ears which he\r\nhad cut off the Cebuanos. North of Cebu City he and his retainers made\r\na fresh start, slaying the people, burning villages, and devastating\r\nthe standing crops. Having accomplished his task within three months\r\nDatto Mandi withdrew with all his men, except two who wished to\r\nsettle at Pardo. He could not persuade them to leave, and after his\r\ndeparture they were cut to pieces by the Cebuanos. Pending positive\r\ncorroboration I was very sceptical about this strange narrative; but,\r\nbeing in Mindanao Island six years afterwards, I went to visit Datto\r\nMandi, who most readily confirmed all the above particulars, and\r\npresented me with his portrait. Prior to the American advent, Datto\r\nMandi, _protege_ as well as protector of the Spaniards, exercised a\r\nsort of feudal dominion over the services and the sundry cherished\r\nbelongings of his people. Speaking of him as I myself found him, he\r\nwas extremely affable and hospitable. The invitation to Datto Mandi\r\nwas perhaps the most singular event of this period, and goes to show\r\nwith what desperate fear the Spaniards retained their hold on the\r\nisland up to the evacuation, which took place on December 26, 1898.\r\n\r\nIn the provinces north of Manila the rebellion was again in full\r\nvigour, and, all trust in Spanish good faith was irrevocably lost. The\r\nSpanish quarters at Subig (Zambales) and Apalit (Pampanga) were\r\nattacked and looted in the first week of March. The new movement bore\r\na more serious aspect than that under Aguinaldo and his colleagues,\r\nwho, at least, were men of certain intelligence, inspired by a wish\r\nto secure reforms, whereas their successors in revolt were of far\r\nless mental capacity, seeking, apparently, only retaliation for the\r\ncruelties inflicted on the people. It is possible, too, that the\r\npremium of P800,000 per 35 rebel chiefs inflamed the imaginations of\r\nthe new leaders, who were too ignorant to appreciate the promised\r\nreforms linked with the same bargain. During the month of February\r\nthe permanent-way of the Manila-Dagupan Railway had been three times\r\ntorn up to prevent the transport of loyal troops. At the same time\r\nthe villages around were looted and burnt. Early in March the rebels,\r\nunder the chief leadership of Yocson, of Malolos, attacked and killed\r\nthe garrisons and the priests in the north of Pangasinan and Zambales,\r\nexcepting six soldiers who managed to escape. [187] Some of the\r\ngarrison troops were murdered after surrender. The telegraph-line\r\nbetween Lingayen (Pangasinan) and a place a few miles from Bolinao\r\n(Zambales) was cut down and removed. A lineman was sent out to repair\r\nit under escort of civil guards, who were forced by the rebels to\r\nretire. On March 7, about 2 a.m., the Eastern Extension Telegraph\r\nCompany's cable-station at Bolinao was besieged by rebels. The village\r\nwas held by about 400 armed natives, who had killed one native and\r\ntwo European soldiers on the way. The lighthouse-keeper and the\r\nInspector of Forests safely reached Santa Cruz, 40 miles south, in\r\na boat. The other civilian Spaniards and priests escaped in another\r\nboat, but were pursued and captured by the insurgents, who killed\r\ntwo of the civilians and brought the European women and friars into\r\nthe village as prisoners at 4.30 the same afternoon. Eight soldiers\r\nhad taken refuge in the cable-station, and at 6 a.m. a message was\r\nsent to the British staff requiring them to turn out the soldiers or\r\nquit the premises themselves. They refused to take either course, and\r\ndeclared their neutrality. A similar message was sent several times,\r\nwith the same result. By 4 p.m. the soldiers had fortified the station\r\nas well as they could, and the rebels attacked, but were repulsed\r\nwith a few shots. Nothing happened during the night, but the next day\r\n(March 8) another message was sent to the British staff urging them to\r\nwithdraw as the rebels would renew the assault at 10 a.m. The staff\r\nagain refused to comply. Then it appears that the rebels delayed\r\ntheir attack until the arrival of their chief, hourly expected. An\r\nultimatum was at length received at the station, to the effect that\r\nif all arms were given up they would spare the soldiers' lives. They\r\nalso demanded the surrender of the two rebels held prisoners by these\r\nsoldiers. At this stage one of the company's staff, who were allowed\r\nto go and come as they pleased, volunteered to interview the rebels;\r\nbut matters could not be arranged, as the Spanish corporal (a plucky\r\nyouth of twenty years of age) in the station refused to surrender\r\nanything at any price. Still parleying was continued, and on March 11\r\none of the company's staff again visited the rebel camp to state that\r\nif the regular bi-monthly steamer failed to arrive on the morrow the\r\ncorporal would surrender arms. Then the rebel chief proposed that the\r\ncorporal should meet him half-way between the company's office and the\r\nrebel camp, the rebel pledging his word of honour that no harm should\r\nbefall the corporal. The corporal, however, could not do this, as it\r\nwould have been contrary to the Spanish military code to capitulate\r\non his own authority, but he confirmed his willingness to surrender\r\narms if no steamer arrived the next day, and the company's employee\r\nreturned to the camp to notify this resolution. But in a few minutes\r\nhe observed a commotion among the insurgents; some one had descried\r\na warship approaching, and the native canoes were very busy making\r\nready for escape or attack. The British delegate, therefore, hastened\r\nback to the station, and at 3 p.m. a Spanish gunboat arrived, to\r\ntheir immense relief, and landed 107 marines. Heavy firing continued\r\nall that afternoon, inflicting great loss on the rebels, whilst the\r\nSpaniards lost one soldier. On March 12 a Spanish cruiser anchored\r\noff the Bay of Bolinao; also a merchant steamer put into port bringing\r\nthe Company's Manila Superintendent with apparatus for communicating\r\nwith Hong-Kong in case the station were demolished. The next day\r\nH.M.S. _Edgar_ entered, and Bolinao was again perfectly safe.\r\n\r\nIn consequence of this threatened attack on the cable-station the\r\ncable was detached from Bolinao and carried on to Manila in the\r\nfollowing month (_vide_ p. 267).\r\n\r\nAs soon as the news reached Manila that Bolinao was menaced, General\r\nMonet proceeded north with 1,000 men, whilst 3,000 more followed by\r\nrailway as far as they could reach. On the way the General had five\r\nengagements with the enemy, between Lingayen (Pangasinan) and Bolinao,\r\nwhere he arrived on the night of March 14, having routed the insurgents\r\neverywhere with great loss to them. On the Spanish side one lieutenant\r\nand one soldier were killed. After leaving a garrison of 300 men in\r\nBolinao, General Monet returned to Manila in the Spanish cruiser the\r\nnext day.\r\n\r\nOn March 31 Father Moises Santos, who had caused all the members of the\r\nTown Council of Malolos to be banished in 1895, was assassinated. He\r\nhad been appointed Vicar of the Augustine Order and was returning to\r\nMalolos station, en route for Manila, in a buggy which stuck fast in\r\na mud-pool (the same in which I have found myself several times),\r\nwhere he was stabbed to death. His body was recovered and taken by\r\nspecial train to Manila, where it was interred with great pomp in\r\nthe Church of St. Augustine. He was 44 years of age, and had been 19\r\nyears in the Colony (_vide_ p. 364).\r\n\r\nIn April, 1898, the Home Government recalled General Primo de Rivera,\r\nappointing in his stead General Basilio Augusti, who had never before\r\nheld chief command in the Islands. Primo de Rivera was no doubt\r\nanxious to be relieved of a position which he could not well continue\r\nto hold, with dignity to himself, after the Madrid Government had\r\nshelved his recommendations for reforms. His subsequent speeches in\r\nthe Senate incline one to draw this conclusion. The Colonial Minister,\r\nSegismundo Moret (who became Prime Minister in 1905), warmly supported\r\nthe proposed reforms, but monastic influences were brought to bear\r\nwhich Praxedes Sagasta had not the moral courage to resist.\r\n\r\nDon Pedro A. Paterno, the peacemaker, was sorely disappointed, too,\r\nthat the Government had failed to remunerate him for his services. His\r\nposition will be best understood from the subjoined translation of\r\nthe letter which he addressed to a high authority on the subject. The\r\noriginal document was read in public session of Congress in Madrid\r\non June 16, 1898, by the Deputy Senor Muro.\r\n\r\n\r\n    _Manila_, _23rd of February_, 1898.\r\n\r\n\r\n    _My Esteemed Friend_,--\r\n\r\n    As it appears that, at last, one is thinking of giving me something\r\n    for the services rendered by me, and as, according to you, the\r\n    recompense is going to be a title of Castile, I wish to speak\r\n    frankly, in secret, on the subject. I do not wish to fall into\r\n    ridicule, because in such a material and mercantile place as Manila\r\n    a title without rent-roll, or grandeur, or anything of the nature\r\n    of an employment, or Cross of Maria Christina, or rewards such\r\n    as have been showered broadcast by three Captain-Generals would,\r\n    in Philippine circles, make me appear as the gullible boy and\r\n    the laughing-stock of my fellows. To express my private opinion,\r\n    I aspire, above all, to the preservation of my name and prestige,\r\n    and if I were asked to renounce them for a childish prize,\r\n    even though it be called a title of Castile, despised by serious\r\n    statesmen in Europe, I think I should be obliged to refuse it. But\r\n    I am willing to meet half-way the state of Spanish society in\r\n    the Philippines, and as I belong to the family of the _Maguinoo_\r\n    Paterno, I must express myself in another way. That title of\r\n    Castile might become the cherished ideal in the Philippines if\r\n    it were valued as I desire.\r\n\r\n    In the first place, it _must not be less than that of Duke_,\r\n    because the natives have obeyed me as the _Great Maguinoo_, or\r\n    Prince of Luzon, and the ex-revolutionists call me the arbiter\r\n    of their destinies.\r\n\r\n    The reward from Spain must not be less than the Philippine public\r\n    already award to me.\r\n\r\n    In the second place, the reward, to be accepted by me with dignity\r\n    and preservation of prestige, must be presented to me in the sense\r\n    that it is for the general welfare of the Philippines as implied\r\n    in the title of _Grandee of Spain of the First Class_ with the\r\n    consequent right to a seat in the Senate to defend the interests\r\n    of the Colony, seeing that we have no Members of Parliament,\r\n    and parliamentary representation is anxiously desired.\r\n\r\n    I can show that I possess an income of P25,000 and more,\r\n    if necessary.\r\n\r\n    In the third place, it must be in the nature of a gift and not\r\n    a purchase, that is to say, the patent of nobility must be a\r\n    free gift.\r\n\r\n    In the fourth place, it must be valued in dollars, so that the\r\n    reward may not be held in contempt by the public, who know my\r\n    liberality when I pay, with splendid generosity, sea voyages,\r\n    river and land journeys for myself and for my emissaries, or\r\n    when I distribute with abundant profusion pecuniary and material\r\n    recompenses _to buy over the wills of and unite all the insurgent\r\n    chiefs to bring them to surrender to Spain_. Up to the present,\r\n    I have not received a cent from the revolutionists or from the\r\n    Spanish Government to cover these expenses.\r\n\r\n    It is notorious that I have worked so grandly that no one can\r\n    now ask me to sink into insignificance.\r\n\r\n    The recent concessions made by the Spanish Government have been\r\n    seen by the Philippine public. The grade of Captain-General was\r\n    given for subjecting a few Moslem chiefs of Mindanao; promotions\r\n    and grand crosses with pensions have been awarded, and I, who have\r\n    put an end to the war at a stroke, saving Spain many millions of\r\n    dollars--I, who, amidst inundations and hurricanes have assaulted\r\n    and conquered the barracks and military posts of the enemy, causing\r\n    them to lay down their arms to Spain without bloodshed, and at my\r\n    command surrender all their chiefs and revolutionary Government\r\n    with their brigades and companies, I think I have good right to\r\n    ask Spain, if she wishes to show herself a mother to me, to give\r\n    me as much as she has given to other sons for lesser services.\r\n\r\n    To conclude, for family reasons, _ I want a title of Castile,\r\n    that of Prince or Duke, if possible, and to be a Grandee of the\r\n    first class_, free of nobility patent fees and the sum of P----\r\n    once for all.\r\n\r\n    I think that the title of Castile, or Spain's reward, if it\r\n    reaches me without the mentioned formalities, will be an object\r\n    of ridicule, and Spain ought not to expose me to this, because\r\n    I wish to serve her always, in the present and in the future.\r\n\r\n    I also recommend you very strongly to procure for my brother\r\n    Maximino Molo Agustin Paterno y Debera Ignacio the title of Count\r\n    or a Grand Cross free of duties, for he has not only rendered\r\n    great services to the nation, but he has continually sustained\r\n    the prestige of Spain with the natives.\r\n\r\n    I am, etc., etc.,\r\n    _Pedro A. Paterno_.\r\n\r\n\r\n    N.B.--1. I told you verbally that if my merits did not reach two\r\n    millimetres, it is the friend's duty to amplify them and extend\r\n    them and make others see them as if they were so many metres,\r\n    especially as they have _no equal_.\r\n\r\n    Prince of Limasaba is the first title of Castile conceded to a\r\n    native of the Philippines. He was the first king of the Island\r\n    of Limasaba in the time of Maghallanes, according to Father Jose\r\n    Fernandez Cuevas, of the Company of Jesus, in his \"Spain and\r\n    Catholicism in the Far East,\" folio 2 (years 1519 to 1595). In\r\n    Spain, in modern times, Prince of Peace, Prince of Vergara, etc.\r\n\r\n    2. and 3. Verbally I mentioned _one million_ of dollars, and\r\n    that Parliament should meet sometimes for the Philippines and for\r\n    extraordinary reasons. Take note that out of the 25,000 men sent\r\n    here by Spain on account of the insurrection, statistics show\r\n    6,000 struck off the effective list in the first six months and\r\n    many millions of dollars expenses. The little present, or the\r\n    Christmas-box (_mi Aguinaldo_) is of no mean worth.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSome biographical notes of Don Pedro A. Paterno, with most of which\r\nhe furnished me himself, may be interesting at this stage.\r\n\r\nHis Excellency Don Pedro Alejandro Paterno belongs to the class of\r\nFilipinos--the Chinese half-caste--remarkable in this Colony for that\r\ncomparative intellectual activity of which Don Pedro himself is one of\r\nthe brightest living examples. In the early decades of last century\r\na Chinaman, called Molo, carried on a prosperous trade in the _Calle\r\ndel Rosario_, in the Manila district of Binondo. His Philippine wife,\r\nwhose family name was Yamson, carried in her veins the \"blue blood,\"\r\nas we should say in Europe, of Luzonia. She was the direct descendant\r\nof the Great _Maguinoo_, or Prince of Luzon, a title hereditary,\r\naccording to tradition. Three sons were the issue of this marriage,\r\none of whom, Maximino Molo, was the father of Pedro. Averse to indolent\r\npleasure during his father's lifetime, Maximino, with his own scant\r\nbut independent resources, started active life with a canoe and a\r\nbarge, conveying goods out as far as Corregidor Island to secure the\r\nfirst dealings with the ships entering the port. In this traffic\r\nhe made money so fast that he opened an office, and subsequently\r\na store of his own, in the _Escolta_. His transactions attained\r\nlarge proportions, and by the time this kind of trade in the bay\r\nbecame obsolete, he was already one of the most respected middlemen\r\noperating between the foreign houses and provincial producers. His\r\nChristian name was abbreviated to Maximo; and so proverbial were his\r\nplacidity and solicitude for others that his friends affectionately\r\nnicknamed him Paterno (paternal), which henceforth became the adopted\r\ncognomen of the family. His unbounded generosity won for him the\r\nadmiration of all his race, who graciously recognized him as their\r\n_Maguinoo_. Sympathetic in the ambitions and in the distress of his\r\nown people, he was, nevertheless, always loyal to Spanish authority;\r\nbut whether his fortune awakened Spanish cupidity, or his influence\r\nwith the masses excited the friars' jealousy, the fact is that in 1872\r\nhe was banished to the Ladrone Islands, accused of having taken part\r\nin the rising of Cavite. Ten years afterwards he was again in Manila,\r\nwhere I had the pleasure of his acquaintance, and on his decease,\r\nwhich took place July 26, 1900, he left considerable wealth.\r\n\r\nBorn in 1857, Pedro A. Paterno, at the early age of 14 years, was\r\nsent for his education to Spain, where he resided 11 years. The\r\npreparatory period over, he entered the University of Salamanca, and\r\nlater on that of Madrid, where, under the protection and tutelage of\r\nthe Marquis de Heredia, he was introduced into aristocratic circles,\r\nin which he became a great favourite. Amongst his college companions\r\nwas the Marquis de Mina. At one time it was proposed that he should\r\nwed the daughter of the Marchioness de Montolibar, a suggestion which\r\nhe disregarded because his heart already inclined towards the Filipina\r\nwho is now his wife.\r\n\r\nHis assistance to the Home Government was of no mean importance. In\r\n1882 he supported the abolition of the Government Tobacco Monopoly. In\r\n1893 he again rendered valuable service to the State, in consideration\r\nof which he was awarded the Grand Cross of Isabella the Catholic, with\r\nthe distinction of \"Excellency.\" In 1895 the oft-discussed question\r\nof the title of nobility he was to receive was revived. After the\r\nPeace of Biac-na-bato he fully expected that the usual Spanish custom\r\nwould have been followed of conceding a title to the Peacemaker. The\r\nprecedents for such an act, in modern times, are the titles given\r\nto Manuel Godoy (1795) and to General Espartero [188] (1840), who\r\nbecame respectively Prince of Peace and Prince of Vergara for similar\r\nservices rendered to the Crown. A dukedom, Paterno believes, would\r\nhave been his reward if the revolution had definitely terminated with\r\nthe retirement of Emilio Aguinaldo from the Islands in 1897.\r\n\r\nA man of versatile gifts, Pedro A. Paterno has made his mark in\r\nliterature with works too numerous to mention; he is a fluent orator,\r\na talented musician, and the composer of the argument of an opera,\r\n_Sangdugong Panaguinip_ (\"The Dreamed Alliance\"). As a brilliant\r\nconversationalist and well-versed political economist he has few\r\nrivals in his country. A lover of the picturesque and of a nature\r\ninclined to revel in scenes of aesthetic splendour, his dream of\r\none day wearing a coronet was nurtured by no vulgar veneration for\r\naristocracy, but by a desire for a recognized social position enabling\r\nhim, by his prestige, to draw his fellow-men from the sordid pleasure\r\nof mere wealth-accumulation towards the sentimental, imaginative\r\nideals of true nobility. In 1904 Pedro A. Paterno was the editor and\r\nproprietor of the newspaper _La Patria_, the mission of which was (1)\r\nto support the American dominion as a _fait accompli_, (2) to urge\r\nthe fulfilment of the promise of eventual Philippine home rule, (3)\r\nto sustain a feeling of gratitude towards Spain, whence the Filipinos\r\nderived their civilization, and (4) to support Roman Catholic unity,\r\non the ground that unity is strength.\r\n\r\nIn the second week of April, 1898, General Primo de Rivera left Manila\r\nfor Spain, on the arrival of his successor in the Captain-Generalcy,\r\nGeneral Basilio Augusti, in the s.s. _Isla de Mindanao_. [189] Some\r\ndays before General Primo de Rivera's departure the American Consul\r\nat Manila had received despatches from his Government to prepare\r\nto quit the Islands, as war was imminent between Spain and the\r\nUnited States. He was further instructed to hand over his consulate\r\narchives to the British Consul, who would take charge of American\r\ninterests. But without the concurrence of the Spanish authorities no\r\nofficial transfer could be made from one consulate to the other, and\r\nthe General professed ignorance of the existing relations between his\r\ncountry and America. He cabled to Madrid for information, but managed\r\nto delay matters until his successor assumed office, when the transfer\r\nwas duly made. Consul Oscar F. Williams was in no way molested. He\r\npassed to and fro in the city without the least insult being offered\r\nhim by any Spaniard. The Gov.-General courteously proposed to send\r\na large bodyguard to his consulate, but it was not necessary. Yet,\r\nas soon as Consul Williams closed his office and went on board the\r\ns.s. _Esmeralda_, the American Consulate escutcheon was painted out,\r\nand the notice boards outside the doors were kicked about the streets.\r\n\r\nGeneral Primo de Rivera was so well aware of the strained relations\r\nbetween Spain and America, that the s.s. _Leon XIII._, in which he\r\ntravelled from Manila to Barcelona, was armed as a cruiser, with two\r\n4-inch Hontoria guns mounted aft of the funnel and two Nordenfeldts\r\nin the bows. This steamer, crowded with refugee Spanish families,\r\nsome of whom slept on the saloon floors, made its first stoppage at\r\nSingapore on April 17. At the next port of call General Primo de Rivera\r\nlearnt that the United States of America had presented an ultimatum\r\nto his Government. Before he reached Barcelona, in the third week of\r\nMay, war between the two countries had already broken out (April 23,\r\n1898). There were riots in Madrid; martial law was proclaimed; the\r\nParliamentary Session was suspended; a strict censorship of the press\r\nwas established; the great disaster to Spanish arms in Philippine\r\nwaters had taken place; the Prime Minister Sagasta had intimated\r\nhis willingness to resign, and Primo de Rivera entered Madrid when\r\nit was too late to save the Philippine Islands for Spain, even had\r\nthe rebel version of the implied reforms under the alleged Treaty of\r\nBiac-na-bato been fulfilled to the letter.\r\n\r\nThe leaders of the principal political parties were hastily summoned\r\nto the palace to consult separately with the Queen-Regent on the\r\nsituation, and they were unanimously of opinion that the Prime Minister\r\nwho had accepted war should carry them through the crisis. Spain was\r\napparently more concerned about the salvation of the Antilles than\r\nof her Far Eastern Colony.\r\n\r\nThe friars, fully alive to their moral responsibility towards the\r\nnation for the loss of the Philippines, were, nevertheless, desirous\r\nof finding a champion of their cause in the political arena, and Deputy\r\nUria was willing to accept this onerous task. The Bishop-elect of Porto\r\nRico (an Austin friar) was a fellow-passenger with General Primo de\r\nRivera. According to _El Liberal_ of June 3, 1898, when he arrived\r\nin Madrid he went with the Procurator of his Order to interview the\r\nColonial Minister, Senor Romero Giron, on the prospects of Deputy\r\nUria's proposed debate when Congress should meet again. The Minister\r\npointed out to them the attendant difficulties, and referred them to\r\nthe Prime Minister. They immediately went to Senor Sagasta's residence,\r\nwhere they were promptly given to understand that _if any one could\r\nbe found to defend them, there might well be others who would oppose\r\nthem_, so their champion withdrew.\r\n\r\nWhen, months later, Parliament was re-opened, the Minister of War\r\ndenied in Congress that the Treaty of Biac-na-bato had ever existed,\r\n[190] and in support of his contention he cited a cablegram which\r\nthe Gov.-General Primo de Rivera is alleged to have sent to the\r\nPrime Minister Sagasta. It was published in the _Gaceta de Madrid_\r\nof December 16, 1897, and reads as follows:--\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n    _(Translation)_\r\n\r\n    _Manila_, 12th of December, 1897\r\n\r\n    To the President of the Council of Ministers, from the\r\n    Governor-General\r\n\r\n    At the expiration of the time allowed and announced in the\r\n    _Gazette_ of November 28, after which rigorous and active\r\n    war measures would be taken against the rebels, a deputation\r\n    from the enemy came to me on behalf of the brothers Aguinaldo,\r\n    Llaneras, and the so-called Republican Government, offering to\r\n    surrender themselves, their followers, and their arms, _on the\r\n    sole conditions of their lives being spared and that they should\r\n    receive means with which to emigrate_. It appears to me, and to the\r\n    general officers of this army, that this surrender is the result\r\n    of the successive combats by which we have held the positions\r\n    taken in Morong, Paray, Minuyan, and Arayat, and the enthusiasm\r\n    displayed by the resolute volunteers in the provinces outside\r\n    Tagalog sphere. I feel sure of being able to take Biac-na-bato,\r\n    as well as all the other points occupied by the rebels, but I am\r\n    not so certain of being able to secure the persons of the chiefs\r\n    of the rebellion with their followers. The war would then be\r\n    carried on by roving parties who, from their hiding-places in\r\n    the forests and mountains, might appear from time to time, and\r\n    although of little importance, they would sustain the rebellion.\r\n\r\n    The generals agree with me that the peace will save the honour\r\n    of Spain and the army, but in view of the importance of the event\r\n    I consider it necessary to solicit the approval of the Government.\r\n\r\n    If the Government should accept the proposals, I will bring them\r\n    to an issue at once, but I so far distrust them that I cannot\r\n    be sure of anything until I have the men and the arms in my\r\n    possession. In any case, it is now the unanimous opinion that\r\n    the situation is saved.\r\n\r\n    _Primo de Rivera_.\r\n\r\n\r\n    _(Translation of reply)_\r\n\r\n    _Madrid_, 13th of December, 1897\r\n\r\n    President of the Council of Ministers to the Governor-General,\r\n\r\n    Manila\r\n\r\n    Colonial Ministry Code. H.M. the Queen has perused with great\r\n    satisfaction your Excellency's telegram, and commands me to\r\n    congratulate you in the name of the nation. In view of the opinion\r\n    of your Excellency and the generals under your orders that _the\r\n    honour of the army is saved_, the Government fully authorizes\r\n    your Excellency to accept the surrender of the rebel chiefs and\r\n    their Government on the terms specified in your telegram. Please\r\n    advise the surrender as soon as possible in order to give due and\r\n    solemn publicity to the event. Receive my sincere congratulations\r\n    and those of the Government.\r\n\r\n    _Sagasta_.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAt the period of the above despatches the Peninsular and the Insular\r\nauthorities were living in a fool's paradise with respect to Philippine\r\naffairs. Had it been officially admitted that those reforms which the\r\nclerical party so persistently opposed, but which the home legislators\r\nwere willing to concede, had been granted to the rebels as a condition\r\nof peace, \"the honour of the army\" would have suffered in Spanish\r\npublic opinion. Hence, the Spaniards' conception of national dignity\r\nimposed on the Government the necessity of representing the rebel\r\nchiefs as repentant, begging for their lives, and craving the means\r\nof existence in exile as the result of Spanish military valour.\r\n\r\nBut abroad, where the ministerial denial, mentioned on p. 414, was\r\npublished by the foreign press, Aguinaldo was universally spoken of\r\nas having been \"bought off.\"\r\n\r\nA wiser government would have learnt a lesson from a sixteen-months'\r\nrebellion and have afterwards removed its causes, if only to ensure\r\nthe mother country's sovereignty. The probability of the Filipinos\r\nbeing able to subvert Spanish rule by their own unaided efforts was\r\nindeed remote, but a review of Spanish colonial history ought to\r\nhave suggested to the legislators that that extraneous assistance to\r\nsedition which promoted emancipation in the former Spanish-American\r\nterritories might one day be extended to the Filipinos.\r\n\r\nThe publication of the above documents, however, did little to calm\r\nthe anger of the Madrid politicians who maintained that Spanish\r\ndominion in the Philippines could only be peacefully assured by a\r\ncertain measure of reform in consonance with the natives' aspirations.\r\n\r\nMonths afterwards, when Spanish sovereignty in the Archipelago\r\nwas drawing to a close, the Conde de las Almenas opened a furious\r\ndebate in the Senate, charging all the Colonial Govs.-General with\r\nincompetency, but its only immediate effect was to widen the breach\r\nbetween political parties.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXIII\r\n\r\nThe Tagalog Rebellion of 1896-98\r\nSecond Period\r\nAmerican Intervention\r\n\r\n\r\nThe prelude to the American occupation of Manila was the demand made\r\non Spain by the Government of the United States of America to evacuate\r\nthe Island of Cuba.\r\n\r\nGenerations of Spanish misrule in that Island had produced a recurrence\r\nof the many attempts to throw off the sovereignty of Spain. In\r\nFebruary, 1895, the flag of insurrection was again unfurled, and at\r\nBaira a proclamation, claiming independence, was issued at the instance\r\nof one of Cuba's most intelligent patriots--Marti. This civil leader,\r\nhowever, died a natural death a few months afterwards, but the chief\r\ncommand of the insurgents in the field was continued by the mulatto\r\nAntonio Maceo. The rebellion was assuming a serious aspect when General\r\nMartinez Campos, who had been instrumental in duping the Cubans in\r\n1878 by the Treaty of Zanjon, was again sent out as Captain-General\r\nof the Island. But the Cubans refused to be caught a second time in\r\nthe same trap. Martinez Campos' theme of \"political action combined\r\nwith military force\" held no weight. During his mild _regime_ the\r\ninsurrection increased rapidly, and in one encounter he himself was\r\nvery near falling a prisoner. In eight months he was relieved of his\r\npost, and General Weyler, Marquis de Teneriffe, who had a reputation\r\nfor severity, succeeded him in command. He was a man of the Duke of\r\nAlba type--the ideal of the traditional Spanish Colonial party who\r\nrecognized no colonists' rights, and regarded concessions of liberty\r\nto the colonies as maternal dispensations to be hoped for only,\r\nbut never demanded. Antonio Canovas, the ultra-Conservative Prime\r\nMinister, had declared that so long as an armed rebel remained in\r\nthe field he would not grant reforms, so the prospect of a settlement\r\nof the disputes between the Government and the governed was hopeless\r\nduring that administration. The duration of the civil war had seriously\r\nprejudiced American trade interests; the pursuance of a conflict under\r\nthe conditions imposed by General Weyler, who caused all non-combatant\r\nIslanders to be \"concentrated\" in places where they were left to\r\nstarve, aroused the just indignation of America and Europe alike. The\r\nhand of the assassin brought the Canovas Ministry to an end on August\r\n8, 1897; General Weyler was recalled six weeks later, and the United\r\nStates Government, which had so repeatedly protested against the\r\nindefinite and wanton waste of lives and fortune in Cuba, dictated to\r\nSpain a limit to its continuance. After a Conservative interregnum\r\nof six weeks under the leadership of General Marcelo Azarraga,\r\nPraxedes Sagasta came into power at the head of a Liberal ministry\r\nand with a Cuban autonomy bill in his portfolio. The newly-appointed\r\nGov.-General, Ramon Blanco, Marquis de Pena Plata, ex-Gov.-General\r\nof the Philippines (_vide_ p. 377)--a more noble and compassionate\r\nman than his predecessor--unsuccessfully essayed the policy of\r\ncoercing the rebels in arms whilst cajoling peaceful autonomists and\r\nseparatists with the long-talked-of self-government. Nevertheless,\r\nthe separatist movement had in no way abated when the Autonomy Bill was\r\npromulgated, and an insular Cuban Government was formed on January 1,\r\n1898. In the meantime the incident of the blowing-up of the American\r\nwarship _Maine_, the cause of which has not yet been made clear to\r\nthe satisfaction of the world, had further incensed the war party\r\nin the United States. [191] Autonomy had come too late; examined in\r\ndetail it was but another form of Spanish dominion, open to almost\r\nsimilar abuses; it was not the will of the people, and it failed\r\nto bring peace. The thousands \"concentrated\" under Weyler's rule\r\nstill formed a moribund mass of squalid misery which Spain was still\r\nunable or unwilling to relieve. America's offer to alleviate their\r\nwretchedness materially was received with suspicion, hemmed in with\r\nconditions, and not openly rejected for the want of physical power to\r\ndo so. Three months of insular government and over 200,000 Spanish\r\ntroops had effected practically nothing; the prospect of peace was\r\nhopeless, and the United States of America formally called upon Spain\r\nto evacuate the Island. Spain argued the point; America insisted on\r\nthe course dictated, and sent an ultimatum to Madrid on April 20,\r\n1898, to be accepted or otherwise within three days. The ministers\r\nPolo de Bernabe and General Woodford withdrew from Washington and\r\nMadrid respectively, and war broke out between the United States and\r\nSpain on Saturday, April 23, 1898.\r\n\r\nIn anticipation of hostilities an American fleet had concentrated at\r\nHong-Kong. On April 23 Major-General Black, the officer administering\r\nthe Colony, issued a proclamation of neutrality, and Commodore Dewey\r\nwithdrew his fleet from British waters to Mirs Bay, [192] at that\r\ntime within Chinese jurisdiction.\r\n\r\nIt was known in Manila that the hostile squadron was on the way to\r\nthe Philippine capital. Submarine mines were laid, or said to have\r\nbeen laid, for some old cable was purchased for the purpose from the\r\ntelegraph-ship _Sherard Osborn _when the submarine cable was removed\r\nfrom Bolinao and carried on to Manila. Admiral Patricio Montojo went\r\nwith four ships to await the arrival of the enemy off Subig (Zambales)\r\non the west coast of Luzon. Subig is a fine natural harbour, but\r\nwith precipitous shores just as Nature has made it. For years the\r\n\"project\" had existed to carry a State railway there from Manila, and\r\nmake Subig the principal Government Naval Station and Arsenal instead\r\nof Cavite. But personal interests and the sloth of the Government\r\ncombined to frustrate the plan. Under the pressing circumstances\r\nthe military authorities pretended to be doing something there,\r\nand sent up a commission. Admiral Montojo expected to find batteries\r\nof artillery mounted and 14 torpedoes in readiness, but absolutely\r\nnothing had been done, so he at once returned to Manila Bay, and\r\nprepared to meet the adversary off Cavite. In Cavite there were two\r\nbatteries, with three guns between them, but at the last moment two\r\ndefective guns were put ashore there from the _Don Juan de Austria_\r\nand two similar pieces from the _Castilla_.\r\n\r\nIn Hong-Kong there was great agitation among the members of the\r\nPhilippine Patriotic League (_Junta Patriotica_) and the rebel chiefs\r\nexiled under the alleged Treaty of Biac-na-bato. The League had\r\npresented to several European Governments, through its own agents,\r\na sort of _Memorandum_, to which no official recognition could be\r\ngiven. The leaguers were now anxious to co-operate with the Americans\r\nin compelling the Spaniards to evacuate the Archipelago. An influential\r\nAmerican in Hong-Kong accepted the honorary post of treasurer of the\r\nPatriotic League Fund, but quarrels over the spoil resulted in General\r\nAguinaldo being obliged by one of his ex-ministers to pay him his\r\nshare, amounting to several thousands of Mexican dollars. Under these\r\ncircumstances General Aguinaldo and his suite proceeded to Singapore,\r\ntravelling _incognito_, so as to avoid any undue interference,\r\nand Aguinaldo took the opportunity to explain in certain official\r\nquarters the existing conditions in the Philippines. The rebel general\r\nopportunely arrived in Singapore at or about the time of the outbreak\r\nof American-Spanish hostilities. Certain American authorities in\r\nthe Far East were desirous of utilizing Aguinaldo's services and\r\nprestige with the armed natives to control them and prevent reprisals\r\nwhen the American forces should appear before Manila. It was hoped\r\nthat, in this way, the lives of many Spaniards in the Islands would\r\nbe spared. Indeed, it eventually resulted so, for Aguinaldo, with\r\nadmirable tact, restrained any impolitic movement on the part of his\r\nfollowers during the American operations against the Spaniards. Only\r\none who had lived in the Islands could adequately appreciate the\r\nunbounded confidence some 20,000 armed natives must have had in\r\nAguinaldo to have refrained, at his bidding, from retaliating on\r\ntheir old masters. According to _El Liberal _newspaper of Madrid,\r\ndated June 28, 1898 (which quotes from _El Dia_), the aspirations\r\nof the Revolutionary Party would appear to have been, at that date,\r\nas follows, viz.:--\r\n\r\n\r\n    1. Philippine Independence to be proclaimed.\r\n\r\n    2. A Federal Republic to be established by vote of the rebels;\r\n    pending the taking of this vote Aguinaldo was to appoint the\r\n    members of that Government.\r\n\r\n    3. The Federal Republic to recognize a temporary intervention of\r\n    American and European Administrative Commissions.\r\n\r\n    4. An American Protectorate to be recognized on the same terms\r\n    as those fixed for Cuba.\r\n\r\n    5. Philippine ports to be opened to all the world.\r\n\r\n    6. Precautionary measures to be adopted against the influx\r\n    of Chinese.\r\n\r\n    7. The existing judicial system to be reformed.\r\n\r\n    8. Liberty of the press and right of assembly to be proclaimed.\r\n\r\n    9. Ample tolerance of all religions and sects, but abolition and\r\n    expulsion of all monastic Orders.\r\n\r\n    10. Measures to be adopted for working up the natural resources\r\n    of the Archipelago.\r\n\r\n    11. The wealth of the country to be developed by the construction\r\n    of highroads and railways.\r\n\r\n    12. The obstacles operating against the development of enterprises\r\n    and employment of foreign capital to be removed.\r\n\r\n    13. The new Government to preserve public order and check all\r\n    reprisals against the Spaniards.\r\n\r\n    14. Spanish officials to be transported to another safe and\r\n    healthy island until there should be an opportunity for their\r\n    return to Spain.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFrom Singapore, General Emilio Aguinaldo returned with his suite to\r\nHong-Kong, where instructions had been given apparently favouring\r\nhis plans for co-operation in the Islands. Consequent on this,\r\nGeneral Aguinaldo and his staff made preparations for proceeding to\r\nManila in an American warship when it should be deemed opportune to\r\ndo so. About the same time the Philippine Patriotic League issued a\r\nproclamation which is too long to reproduce here, as it covers eight\r\nfolios of print. This document sets forth that whereas the Treaty of\r\nBiac-na-bato had not been fulfilled by the Spanish Government, the\r\nRevolutionists considered themselves absolved therefrom, and morally\r\nfree again to take the offensive in open warfare for the security of\r\ntheir rights and liberty. But this document does not quote any of the\r\ntext of the above alleged treaty. Proclamations and exhortations to\r\nthe rebels were issued with such frequency that it would be tedious\r\nto cite them all, but the following is a fair example:--\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n    _(Translation of Full Text)_\r\n\r\n\r\n    _Philippine Patriots_:--\r\n\r\n    A nation which has nothing good can give nothing. It is evident\r\n    we cannot depend on Spain to obtain the welfare we all desire. A\r\n    country like Spain, where social evolution is at the mercy of\r\n    monks and tyrants, can only communicate to us its own instincts\r\n    of calumny, infamy, inquisitorial proceedings, avarice, secret\r\n    police, false pretences, humiliation, deprivation of liberties,\r\n    slavery, and moral and material decay which characterize its\r\n    history. Spain will need much time to shake off the parasites\r\n    which have grown upon and cling to her; she has no self-dependence\r\n    so long as her nationality is composed of inquisitorial monks,\r\n    ambitious soldiers, demoralized civil servants, and a populace\r\n    bred to support this state of things in silence. It is therefore\r\n    useless to expect anything from Spain.\r\n\r\n    During three and a half centuries Spain's policy has been a\r\n    delusion. Is there a conflict between Spain and England or\r\n    Holland? Then the friars come and relate to us preposterous\r\n    absurdities of the miracles of Saint Francis and of the Image of\r\n    the Virgin of the Rosary, whilst Simon de Anda calls the Pampango\r\n    natives his brothers so long as they fight to save the Spanish\r\n    flag falling into the hands of English or Dutch _savages!_\r\n    Is the foreign invasion ended? Then the friars, through their\r\n    salaried agents in the press, reward us with epithets such as\r\n    monkey, buffalo, etc. Is there another conflict imminent between\r\n    Germany and Spain? Then the friars call the natives Spaniards and\r\n    the military officers own us as their sons and they dub us brave\r\n    soldiers. Is the conflict finished? Then we are again overgrown\r\n    boys, beings of inferior race and incapable of being civilized. Is\r\n    there now to be a struggle with Americans? Then General Augusti,\r\n    who is the living symbol of Spanish authority, who ought to be the\r\n    most prudent of the prudent, the most cultivated of the cultivated,\r\n    points at America as a nation composed of all social excrescences;\r\n    the friars and their enslaved Spaniards want again to cajole\r\n    and cheat us with offers of participation in public affairs,\r\n    recognition of the military grades of ex-rebel chiefs, and other\r\n    twaddle degrading to those who would listen to it. In fact,\r\n    they have called into their councils the sons of the country,\r\n    whilst they exclusively carry out their own ideas, and reserve\r\n    to themselves the right to set aside all the resolutions at a\r\n    stroke. They offer to enrol in their ranks the insurgents of\r\n    yesterday, so that they can have them all shot on the morrow of\r\n    the present difficulty. What irrision! Do you want another trick\r\n    exposed? Now that Spain is in danger of losing the Philippines,\r\n    the executioners of the other day--the everlasting tyrants--tell us\r\n    that America will sell the Islands to England. No, America has its\r\n    past and its present. America will preserve a clear intelligence;\r\n    she is not dominated by friars and tyrants like Spain; she is\r\n    liberal; she has liberated her slaves against the will of the\r\n    Spaniards who were, for the most part, their owners. A country\r\n    is known by its national character; review its past history\r\n    and it is easy to understand the calumny launched against the\r\n    Americans. But even though we became English, should we not gain\r\n    by it? The English have conceded self-government to many of their\r\n    colonies, and not of the frail delusive sort that Spain granted\r\n    to Cuba. In the English colonies there are liberties which Spain\r\n    never yielded to hers in America or the Philippines.\r\n\r\n    Our country is very rich, and as a last resource we can buy it\r\n    from the Americans. Do not be deceived by the Spaniards! Help\r\n    the Americans, who promise us our liberty. Do not fall into\r\n    the error of taking Spain to be a civilized country. Europe and\r\n    America consider her the most barbarous of the century. There the\r\n    weakest is the most persecuted. In no country to-day but Spain is\r\n    the Inquisition tolerated. It is proved by the tortures imposed on\r\n    the prisoners of Montjuich, of the Philippines, and of Cuba. Spain\r\n    did not fulfil the agreement entered into with Maximo Gomez at\r\n    Zanjon, nor that made with Aguinaldo at Biac-na-bato. Spain is\r\n    a nation always more ready to promise than to perform. But ask\r\n    for friars, soldiers, and State dependents to come and devour\r\n    our wealth, and instantly you will get them. Spain has nothing\r\n    else to give, and God grant she will keep what she has. Spain\r\n    will flatter you under the present circumstances, but do not be\r\n    deceived. Submit every fawning offer to your conscience. Remember\r\n    the executions of the innocents, the tortures and atrocities which\r\n    have been the means of covering with decorations the breasts of\r\n    those who took the blood of your fathers, brothers, relations\r\n    and friends. Providence will aid the Americans in their triumph,\r\n    for the war is a just one for the nation elected to lead us to the\r\n    goal of our liberty. Do not rail against the designs of Providence;\r\n    it would be suicidal. Aid the Americans!\r\n\r\n    _(Anonymous.)_\r\n\r\n\r\nOn the other side, far richer in poetic imagination and religious\r\nfervour, is the Allocution of the Archbishop of Madrid-Alcala published\r\nin Madrid on the day hostilities commenced. The following extract\r\nwill suffice to show how the religious sentiment of the people was\r\nindirectly appealed to to convince them that Spain was defending a\r\nnoble cause.\r\n\r\n\r\n    _Very Beloved Sons_:--\r\n\r\n    The cursed hunger for gold and the unquenchable thirst for power\r\n    have combined to tarnish that flag which the Great Queen Isabella\r\n    raised, by the hand of Columbus, in the West Indies. With justice\r\n    trodden under foot, the voice of the Pope unheeded, and the\r\n    intervention of the nations despised with arrogance, every road\r\n    to the counsels of peace has been barred and the horrors of war\r\n    have become a necessity. Let Heaven be witness that we are not\r\n    the authors of this disaster, and let the responsibility before\r\n    God be on that vain people whose dogma seems to be that money\r\n    is the God of the world.... There, ploughing the seas, go our\r\n    soldiers and our sailors. Have no fear, let no one weep, unless,\r\n    indeed, it be for fear of arriving too late for the fray. Go,\r\n    braves, to fight with the blessing of the Fatherland. With you\r\n    goes all Spain, from the Mediterranean to the Atlantic, from Irun\r\n    to Tarifa. With what envy do We contemplate you weighing anchor\r\n    to leave our shores! Oh! why does juvenility, or decrepitude, or\r\n    duty deprive us of the joy of taking part in your enterprise? But\r\n    no! with you goes our Spanish heart.... May the Immaculate Virgin,\r\n    whose scapulary hangs around your necks and whose blessed image\r\n    floats on your flags, protect you under her mantle in the moment\r\n    of danger, deliver you from all evil, and shower blessings upon\r\n    you! May Saint James, patron of Spain, and the martyr Nicodemus\r\n    and Saint Telmo and Saint Raymond and the King Saint Ferdinand\r\n    go before you and ever march in the vanguard wherever you may go\r\n    and make you invulnerable to the bullets of the enemy, so that you\r\n    may return victorious to tread once more this noble soil and kiss\r\n    the cheek of the weeping mother who bore you!... We, who cannot\r\n    go to take part in the battles, will hold and brandish the arms\r\n    of prayer, like Moses who prayed on the mountain, whilst Joshua\r\n    slew his ferocious enemies in the valley.... God has triumph in\r\n    His hand and will give it to whom He pleases. He gave it to Spain\r\n    in Covadonga, in Las Navas, in El Salado, in the river of Seville,\r\n    on the plain of Granada, and in a thousand battles which overflow\r\n    the pages of history. O Lord, give it us now! Let the nations\r\n    see that against the right of might there is the might of right!\r\n\r\n    To all beloved sons, from our heart We have pleasure in sending\r\n    you our pastoral benediction, in the name of the Father, and the\r\n    Son, and the Holy Ghost. Amen.\r\n\r\n    Given in our palace in Madrid on the 23rd of April, 1898.\r\n\r\n\r\n    _Jose Ma_\r\n    _Archbishop-bishop of Madrid-Alcala_.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThis Allocution calls to mind Spain's last struggle with Mexico. Was\r\nit a battle of the saints? The Spaniards relied on Santa Isabel;\r\nthe Mexicans appealed to Santa Guadalupe, and the latter came out\r\nvictorious.\r\n\r\nIn Manila, as the critical day approached, Gov.-General Augusti issued\r\nhis general order as to special military service and his proclamation\r\nto the Philippine people. The latter is couched in vituperative and\r\nerroneously prophetic language, but both can be better appreciated\r\nfrom the following translated texts:--\r\n\r\n\r\n    _Special Military Service_\r\n\r\n    Whereas it is necessary to adopt every possible means for the\r\n    defence of this territory and to render assistance to the army\r\n    and the fleet in the approaching operations against the United\r\n    States of North America, I order:\r\n\r\n    1. It is hereby declared that a state of war exists.\r\n\r\n    2. All public functionaries of the State and the municipalities,\r\n    not exceeding 50 years of age and not physically unfit, are obliged\r\n    to take up arms in defence of the country and serve whenever they\r\n    are required. They will proceed, at once, to their offices and\r\n    lodge their names and serve under their present chiefs.\r\n\r\n    3. All Spaniards and sons of Spaniards (although not born in the\r\n    Peninsula) above the age of 20 and not more than 50, living in\r\n    the Provinces, are also hereby required to take up arms.\r\n\r\n    4. All those not comprised in the foregoing are at liberty to\r\n    serve as Volunteers.\r\n\r\n    (_a_) All native Spaniards who are not employed in the\r\n    public offices.\r\n\r\n    (_b_) All those who are under 20 and more than 50 years of age,\r\n    and who are strong enough to endure the fatigue of a campaign.\r\n\r\n    (_c_) All foreigners (except North Americans) who are domiciled\r\n    in Manila or in the capitals of the Provinces.\r\n\r\n    5. The General Sub-Inspector will organize these Volunteers,\r\n    and distribute them as required for defensive purposes.\r\n\r\n    6. Public functionaries will receive their orders for military\r\n    service from their respective administrative chiefs.\r\n\r\n    7. From this date no one capable of bearing arms is allowed to\r\n    leave these Islands. This prohibition does not apply to those\r\n    who are seriously ill.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n    _Proclamation_\r\n\r\n    _Spaniards_:--\r\n\r\n    Between Spain and the United States of North America hostilities\r\n    have broken out.\r\n\r\n    The moment has arrived to prove to the world that we possess\r\n    the spirit to conquer those who, pretending to be loyal friends,\r\n    take advantage of our misfortunes and abuse our hospitality, using\r\n    means which civilized nations consider unworthy and disreputable.\r\n\r\n    The North American people, composed of all the social excrescences,\r\n    have exhausted our patience and provoked war with their perfidious\r\n    machinations, with their acts of treachery, with their outrages\r\n    against the law of nations and international treaties.\r\n\r\n    The struggle will be short and decisive. The God of Victories\r\n    will give us one as brilliant and complete as the righteousness\r\n    and justice of our cause demand. Spain, which counts upon the\r\n    sympathies of all the nations, will emerge triumphantly from\r\n    this new test, humiliating and blasting the adventurers from\r\n    those States that, without cohesion and without a history, offer\r\n    to humanity only infamous traditions and the sorry spectacle\r\n    of Chambers in which appear united insolence and defamation,\r\n    cowardice and cynicism.\r\n\r\n    A squadron manned by foreigners, possessing neither instruction\r\n    nor discipline, is preparing to come to this Archipelago with\r\n    the blackguardly intention of robbing us of all that means life,\r\n    honour, and liberty. Pretending to be inspired by a courage of\r\n    which they are incapable, the North American seamen undertake\r\n    as an enterprise capable of realization the substitution of\r\n    Protestanism for the Catholic religion you profess, to treat you\r\n    as tribes refractory to civilization, to take possession of your\r\n    riches as if they were unacquainted with the rights of property,\r\n    and to kidnap those persons whom they consider useful to man their\r\n    ships or to be serviceable in agricultural or industrial labour.\r\n\r\n    Vain designs! Ridiculous boastings!\r\n\r\n    Your indomitable bravery will suffice to frustrate the attempt\r\n    to carry out their plans. You will not allow the faith you\r\n    profess to be made a mockery of, with impious hands placed on\r\n    the temple of the true God, the images you adore to be thrown\r\n    down by unbelief. The aggressors shall not profane the tombs of\r\n    your fathers, they shall not gratify their lustful passions at\r\n    the cost of your wives' and daughters' honour, or appropriate\r\n    the property that your industry has accumulated as a provision\r\n    for your old age. No, they shall not perpetrate any of the crimes\r\n    inspired by their wickedness and covetousness, because your valour\r\n    and your patriotism will suffice to punish and abase the people\r\n    who, claiming to be civilized and polished, have exterminated the\r\n    natives of North America instead of bringing to them the life of\r\n    civilization and of progress.\r\n\r\n    Filipinos, prepare for the struggle, and united under the\r\n    glorious Spanish banner, which is ever bedecked with laurels,\r\n    let us fight with the conviction that victory will reward our\r\n    efforts; against the shouts of our enemies let us resist with\r\n    Christian decision and the patriotic cry of \"Viva Espana!\r\n\r\n    _Manila_, _23rd of April_, 1898.\r\n\r\n    Your General,\r\n    _Basilio Augusti y Davila_.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe volunteers and guerilla battalions which had been so recently\r\ndisbanded by General Primo de Rivera, because they terrorized the\r\npeaceful inhabitants, were now publicly thanked and praised for their\r\npast services and called upon again to serve their country. The Mayor\r\nof Manila issued his own proclamation, exhorting the inhabitants\r\nto help the Spaniards against the Americans. Archbishop Nozaleda\r\nalso made his appeal to the people, assuring them that four Spanish\r\nbattleships were on their way out (although, as a matter of fact,\r\nonly one existed, namely, the _Pelayo_ 8,500 tons, built in 1887),\r\nand that from direct communication with the Almighty he had learnt that\r\nthe most Christian Spain would be victorious in the next engagement.\r\n\r\nThere was a general stampede of those who could get away; numbers\r\nof families fled up the Pasig River towards the Lake of Bay. The\r\napproaches to Manila from the north were held by the rebels; Cavite\r\nProvince threw off the cloak of pacification and sent fresh levies to\r\ninvest the highroads leading from the south to the capital. General\r\nAugusti's wife and children, who had been conducted for safety to\r\nMacabebe (Lower Pampanga), were kidnapped by the rebels. All Americans\r\n(about 25), except one family, took refuge on board foreign ships in\r\nthe bay. The one exception was a Mr. Johnson, who had been travelling\r\nthrough the Islands with a cinematograph show, and he refused to remove\r\nhis wife, who had just given birth. The well-known s.s. _Esmeralda_\r\ntook on board a crowd of passengers for Hong-Kong at fancy rates of\r\npassage. Refugees offered as much as four times the usual passage-money\r\nfor a saloon berth, and deck-passengers were willing to pay three\r\ntimes the normal rate. The Chinese were leaving the Islands by\r\nhundreds by any available opportunity, for they had just as much to\r\nfear from the loyal as the rebel faction. The rich Chinese were robbed\r\nand the labouring class were pressed into service fit for beasts of\r\nburden. Despised by the Spaniards and hated by the natives, their lives\r\nwere not safe anywhere. Foreign families of neutral nationality sought\r\nmore tranquil asylum far beyond the suburbs or on ships lying in the\r\nharbour. Two days before the Americans arrived a native regiment was\r\nsuspected of disaffection. The Spanish officers therefore picked out\r\nsix corporals and shot them forthwith, threatening to do the same\r\non the morrow if the ringleaders were not handed over. During the\r\nnight the whole regiment went over to the rebels with their rifles\r\nand accoutrements. No intelligent European foreigner entertained any\r\ndoubt as to the result of the coming contest, but the general fear\r\n(which happily proved to be unfounded) was that it would be followed\r\nby an indiscriminate massacre of the Spaniards.\r\n\r\nThere were warships of several nations in the bay, and the Spanish\r\nfleet was moored off Cavite awaiting the arrival of the adversary's\r\nsquadron. The Spanish men-of-war, which were always painted white, had\r\ntheir colour changed to dark grey like the American ships. All coast\r\nlights were extinguished. The Island of Corregidor and Funta Restinga\r\nwere hastily supplied with a few 6-inch guns from the _Castilla_. Punta\r\nGorda, Punta Larisi, the rock El Fraile, and Caballo Island had toy\r\nbatteries compared with the American armament.\r\n\r\nThe American men-of-war left Mirs Bay (opposite to Hong-Kong Island)\r\non April 27, under the command of Commodore Dewey, and on the way made\r\na reconnaissance at Subig, but finding no opponent there, they steamed\r\non to Manila. With all lights put out the American ships entered the\r\nbay, passing Corregidor Island at 3 a.m. on Sunday, May 1, 1898. The\r\n_Olympia_, with Commodore Dewey aboard, led the way. The defenders of\r\nCorregidor Island [193] were apparently slumbering, for the _Olympia_\r\nhad already passed when a solitary cannon-shot was heard and responded\r\nto. Then a shot or two were fired from the rock El Fraile and from\r\nthe battery of Punta Sangley. The American squadron kept its course\r\nin line of battle; the Spanish ships, under the command of Admiral\r\nMontojo, who was on board the _Reina Cristina_, cleared for action,\r\nand the opposing fleets took up positions off the north of Cavite\r\n(_vide_ plan of Cavite).\r\n\r\nAfter an intimation of \"no surrender\" from the Spaniards, by a\r\ncannon-shot fired from the Fort of Santiago towards the approaching\r\nUnited States fleet, the American ships opened fire, to which the\r\nSpanish fleet responded with a furious broadside; but being badly\r\ndirected it did very little damage. The _Don Antonio de Ulloa_\r\ndischarged a broadside at the enemy's ships with almost no effect,\r\nand simultaneously the drums were beaten, whilst the officers and\r\ncrews shouted \"Long live the King, Queen, and Spain!\" Firing on both\r\nsides then became general. The well-aimed shots of the Americans were\r\nbeginning to tell forcibly against the Spaniards. The _Don Juan de\r\nAustria_ advanced towards the _Olympia_ and was met with a shower\r\nof shot and shell, obliging her to turn back. The _Reina Cristina_,\r\nseeing the failure of the _Don Juan de Austria_, steamed full-speed\r\ntowards the _Olympia_, intending to engage her at short range,\r\nbut a perfect hurricane of projectiles from the _Olympia_ made her\r\nretreat with her decks strewn with the dead and dying. The _Baltimore_\r\nhad one gun put out of action by the Hontoria guns of Punta Sangley,\r\nwhilst half a dozen men were slightly injured. The _Boston_ also was\r\nslightly damaged, but further than that the American ships suffered\r\nlittle or nothing. By 7.30 a.m. the Spanish flagship _Reina Cristina_\r\nwas in flames, so a boat was lowered to transfer the Admiral and his\r\nstaff to the _Isla de Cuba_. The captain of the _Reina Cristina_,\r\nDon Luis Cadarso, although mortally wounded, heroically commanded\r\nhis men up to the moment of death. By 8 a.m. the Spanish ships were\r\ndecidedly crippled, and the American squadron withdrew to another\r\npart of the bay, where, behind a number of foreign war and merchant\r\nships, they had left two supply transports, from which they took fresh\r\nammunition. Meantime the little Spanish gunboats _General Lezo, Marques\r\ndel Duero, Manila, Velasco_, and _Argos_, which were quite unfit for\r\naction, ran ashore at Cavite Viejo. The three shore-batteries of Fort\r\nSantiago, the Luneta battlement, and Fort San Antonio Abad (Malate)\r\nrespectively continued ineffectual firing towards the American fleet\r\nuntil the Commodore sent a message telling them to cease fire or he\r\nwould shell the city. At 11 a.m. the Americans returned in line of\r\nbattle, and opened fire on the Spanish ships which still had their\r\nflags flying, and cannonaded and silenced the forts at Punta Sangley\r\nand Canacao. These operations lasted about one hour. Of the Spanish\r\nships the _Castillo_, and _Reina Cristina_ were burnt; the _Don Juan\r\nde Austria_ was blown up, and the _Don Antonio de Ulloa_, pierced all\r\nover with shot, sank after the action, and about half of her crew\r\nwhich had survived the battle were drowned. Only the two cruisers\r\n_Isla de Cuba_ and _Isla de Luzon_ remained in fighting condition,\r\nbut the position was so hopeless that Admiral Montojo ordered them\r\nto run aground in the Bay of Bacoor.\r\n\r\nThe Americans then opened fire on the Arsenal and Fort of Cavite,\r\nwhich had not a single gun left in place. Soon a Spanish officer,\r\nnamed Lostoa, signalled for a truce to save the women, children, and\r\nwounded. An American officer met him and replied that having destroyed\r\nthe fleet the American mission was ended for the present, and agreed\r\nto suspend firing provided the shore-batteries at the river-mouth\r\nwere silent. General Augusti was consulted as to this condition, and\r\nagreed to it. The mail-steamer _Isla de Mindanao_ was aground off Las\r\nPinas, and being armed as a cruiser the Americans fired on her and\r\nshe was soon ablaze. There was still another parley with reference\r\nto Cavite. The Americans demanded the surrender of the Arsenal, the\r\nAdmiral, and the surviving crews of the destroyed fleet. As General\r\nPena declined to surrender Cavite, the Americans gave the Spaniards\r\ntwo hours to evacuate, under the threat of bombarding Manila if the\r\ndemand were not complied with. Again the answer was negative, and\r\nfive hours were allowed so that General Pena could consult with the\r\nCaptain-General. General Augusti having authorized the evacuation, in\r\nless than two hours Cavite and the whole isthmus, including San Roque,\r\nCaridad, Estanzuela, and Dalahican, were under American control. All\r\nthe Spanish families returned to Manila by land. The next day (May 2)\r\nthe _debris_was cleared away from Cavite and the environs, and the\r\ndwellings were cleansed and put in order for indefinite military\r\noccupation.\r\n\r\nThe evacuation of Corregidor Island was demanded by the Americans,\r\nand the 100 men composing the garrison were allowed to depart in\r\nboats for Naig on the west coast of Cavite. Their commander, however,\r\nsurrendered himself prisoner, and went on board the _Baltimore_ with\r\nhis family. He was at once offered (but wisely refused) his liberty,\r\nand later on he was put ashore at Balanga (Bataan).\r\n\r\nOn the Spanish side the losses in men and officers amounted to about\r\n400 killed. It was a decisive victory for the Americans; the entire\r\nSpanish fleet in Philippine waters was destroyed, excepting a few small\r\ngunboats stationed about the southern islands. [194] After a 15 months'\r\ncruise one of these--the _Callao_--steamed into Manila Bay on May\r\n12 in complete ignorance of what had happened. The Americans fired a\r\nwarning shot, and ordered her to lower her flag. With little hesitation\r\nshe did so, in view of the immensely superior force displayed. The\r\nvessel became a prize, and the commander a prisoner of war. But he\r\nwas shortly offered his liberty on parole, which he unfortunately\r\naccepted, for the Spaniards in Manila had so lost their heads that\r\nthey accused him of cowardice in not having fought the whole American\r\nsquadron! He was actually court-martialled and condemned to death,\r\nbut afterwards reprieved.\r\n\r\nThe Spaniards exhibited great bravery in the battle of Cavite, and\r\nman for man they proved themselves to be in no way inferior to their\r\nopponents. Considering the wretched condition of their old-fashioned\r\nships and armament compared with the splendid modern equipment which\r\nthe Americans brought, no other result could have been expected. The\r\nAmerican losses were seven men wounded, none killed, and only slight\r\ndamage to one vessel.\r\n\r\nLong before sunset Admiral Montojo and his surviving officers found\r\ntheir way to Manila. [195] In the evening the Admiral serenely\r\npassed the hours in his suburban villa, whilst the Americans were in\r\npossession of the Port of Manila, and the stars and stripes floated\r\nover the town and arsenal of Cavite, and the forts of Canacao and Punta\r\nSangley. So little did the people and the ignorant Spanish priests\r\nunderstand how a modern military occupation was conducted that when\r\nCommodore Dewey landed his marines a deputation of friars and nuns\r\nmet him to humbly crave clemency for the vanquished. The entry of the\r\nAmerican squadron, without opposition, into the Bay of Manila, was\r\na great surprise to the inhabitants of the capital. Whilst the women\r\nand children were driven off to the suburbs of the city and near-lying\r\nvillages, male Spaniards, from the highest to the lowest--merchants,\r\nState dependents, Spanish troops, and even those native auxiliaries\r\nwho still remained loyal hastened to assure the Gov.-General that\r\n\"the enemy should not land in Manila without passing over their dead\r\nbodies.\" Subsequent facts, however, proved these pompous vows to\r\nbe merely a figure of speech. From the city walls, the terraces of\r\nhouses, the church towers, and every available height, thousands of\r\ncurious sightseers witnessed the brave defence and the complete defeat\r\nof the Spaniards. As the American fleet advanced in line of battle a\r\nSpanish transport was scuttled at the mouth of the Pasig River to bar\r\nthe entrance. All the small steamers and sailing-craft in the river\r\nmoved up as near as possible to the _Puente de Espana_. The obsolete\r\nguns on the Luneta battlement fired a few solitary shots without the\r\nleast effect; the Fort of Santiago, defending the Pasig River entrance,\r\nwas almost silent, although guns, said to be over a century old, had\r\nbeen hastily mounted there, notwithstanding the fact that the colonel,\r\nwho was instructed to have the rust chipped off these ancient pieces\r\nof artillery, committed suicide in despair. Not a single torpedo had\r\nbeen brought into action by the Spaniards. There were several in stock\r\nat Cavite Arsenal, but, when wanted, each had an important piece\r\nmissing, so they were unserviceable. About 4.30 p.m. the American\r\nships changed their position, and moved towards Manila City. A\r\nformal demand was made on the Gov.-General Augusti to surrender the\r\ncapital. The British Consul, who had received instructions to look\r\nafter American interests pending hostilities, served as the medium\r\nof communication between the representatives of the conflicting\r\nparties. The Consuls had an interview with the Captain-General, who,\r\nafter a brief consultation with his colleagues, gave the customary\r\nSpanish reply to the effect that he would resist to the last drop of\r\nblood in his veins. Frequent intercourse took place between the Spanish\r\nGov.-General and the American Commodore through the intermediary of the\r\nBritish Consul. The same afternoon another British, another French,\r\nand another German man-of-war entered the Bay. Rear-Admiral Dewey\r\n(for he had just been promoted in rank) declared the port blockaded.\r\n\r\nOn May 2 he demanded to be put in possession of the telegraph-station,\r\nand on this being refused he ordered the cable connecting Luzon with\r\nHong-Kong to be cut. The Spanish authorities had just time before this\r\nmeasure was taken to report the bare facts to Madrid by cable. The\r\nnews produced immense consternation in the Spanish capital. The whole\r\ncity was instantly in uproar. Mobs of people filled the streets,\r\nwildly denouncing the incapability of a Government which could lead\r\nthem to such disaster. The newspaper offices were thronged. Special\r\nsupplements were issued as quickly as possible. The cafes, clubs,\r\nand other public meeting-places were besieged. General Borbon drove\r\nout in a carriage from which he harangued the populace, and was,\r\nin consequence, sent to a fortress for three months. There was an\r\nattempt at holding a mass meeting in the _Puerta del Sol_, but the\r\nsurging crowd started down the _Calle de Sevilla_ and the _Carrera\r\nde San Geronimo_ shouting, \"Long live Weyler!\" \"To the house of\r\nWeyler!\" They reached his residence, and after a series of frantic\r\n_vivas_ for the army, navy, etc., they called on General Weyler\r\nto appear at the balcony. But being himself in somewhat strained\r\nrelations with the existing Government, he did not think it prudent\r\nto show himself. Then some one having set up the cry of \"Down with\r\nthe whole Government!\" which was responded to with frenzied applause,\r\nthe rioters set out for Sagasta's house, returning by the _Carrera de\r\nSan Geronimo_. At that moment the mounted civil guard met and charged\r\nthe crowd. Many were trodden under foot, and arrests were made. The\r\nCivil Governor, Senor Aguilera, followed up in his carriage, and when\r\nthe military police had dispersed the general mass, leaving only here\r\nand there a group, the Civil Governor stepped out of his carriage and\r\naddressed them. His words were hissed from the balcony of a club,\r\nand it was already past midnight when the first outburst of public\r\nindignation and despair had exhausted itself. On May 2 the _Heraldo_\r\nof Madrid, calmly reviewing the naval disaster, commented as follows:--\r\n\r\n\r\n    It was no caprice of the fortune of war. From the very first\r\n    cannon-shot our fragile ships were at the mercy of the formidable\r\n    hostile squadron; were condemned to fall one after the other\r\n    under the fire of the American batteries; they were powerless\r\n    to strike, and were defended only by the valour and breasts of\r\n    their sailors. What has been gained by the illusion that Manila\r\n    was fortified? What has been gained by the intimation that the\r\n    broad and beautiful bay on whose bosom the Spanish Fleet perished\r\n    yesterday had been rendered inaccessible? What use was made of the\r\n    famous Island of Corregidor? What was done with its guns? Where\r\n    were the torpedoes? Where were those defensive preparations\r\n    concerning which we were requested to keep silence?\r\n\r\n\r\nSeveral merchant vessels were seized in and about Manila Bay, and\r\nsupplies from seawards were cut off from the city, which was quite at\r\nthe mercy of Admiral Dewey, who could have bombarded it and forced\r\nsurrender the same day. But it was not easy to foresee what might\r\nfollow. Admiral Dewey had full discretion to act as circumstances might\r\nseem to guide him, but it was evident that whatever the surrender of\r\nthe Captain-General of the Archipelago might theoretically imply,\r\na military occupation of Manila was far from being tantamount to\r\npossession of the Islands. Hemmed in everywhere on land by the\r\ninsurgent forces which now occupied and collected taxes in several\r\nLuzon provinces, the Spaniards could have been shelled out of the\r\ncapital and forced to capitulate, or driven to extermination by the\r\nthousands of armed natives thirsting for their blood. The Americans\r\nhad, consequently, a third party to consider. The natives' anxiety\r\nto oust the Spaniards was far stronger than their wish to be under\r\nAmerican, or indeed any foreign, control. But whilst a certain section\r\nof the common people was perfectly indifferent about such matters,\r\nothers, wavering at the critical moment between their opposition\r\nto the Spaniards and repulsion of the foreign invader, whoever he\r\nmight be, proclaimed their intention to cast in their lot with the\r\nformer. Lastly, there was Aguinaldo's old rebel party, which rallied\r\nto the one cry \"Independence.\" \"Nothing succeeds like success,\" and\r\nif the rebel version of the alleged Treaty of Biac-na-bato had been\r\nfulfilled in the spirit, no doubt Aguinaldo would have been unanimously\r\nrevered as a great reformer. But the relinquishment of the strife\r\nby the leaders, the money transaction, and the immediate renewal of\r\nSpanish severities, together created an impression in the minds of\r\nthe rebel rank-and-file that, in some way, their general welfare had\r\nbeen sacrificed to personal interest. It was doubtful, therefore,\r\nhow Aguinaldo would be received on his return to the Islands. With\r\nthe object of investigating the feelings of the old rebel party,\r\nthe leader Jose Alejandrino and two other rebels accompanied the\r\nAmerican expedition to Cavite, where they disembarked. Several days\r\npassed in convincing the rebels of Aguinaldo's good faith in all\r\nthat had occurred, and in the meantime Aguinaldo himself arrived on\r\nMay 19 with 12 other rebel leaders in the American despatch-boat\r\n_Hugh McCulloch_. It yet remained doubtful whether he still held\r\nthe confidence of the rank-and-file; but when he at length landed\r\nat Cavite, his old companions-in-arms, and many more, rallied to\r\nhis standard with the greatest enthusiasm. The rebels at that date\r\nwere computed to number 30,000, and Aguinaldo, on taking the command,\r\ndeclared himself Dictator. Aguinaldo was, naturally, at that period,\r\non the most amicable terms with Admiral Dewey, who allowed him to have\r\ntwo modern field-pieces, 500 rifles, and 200,000 rounds of ammunition,\r\nenjoining on him the strict observance of his engagement to repress\r\nreprisals against the Spaniards.\r\n\r\nTo prepare the natives for the arrival of the Americans, Emilio\r\nAguinaldo sent over in advance of the American Fleet the following\r\nexhortation:--\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n    _Compatriots_:--\r\n\r\n    Divine Providence is about to place independence within our reach,\r\n    in a manner most acceptable to a free and independent people.\r\n\r\n    The Americans, not for mercenary motives but for the sake of\r\n    humanity, in response to the woes of the persecuted, have thought\r\n    fit to extend their protecting arm to our beloved country,\r\n    now that they have been obliged to sever their relations with\r\n    Spain on account of the tyranny practised in Cuba, to the great\r\n    prejudice of the large commercial interests which the Americans\r\n    have there. An American squadron is at this moment preparing\r\n    to sail for the Philippines. We, your brothers, fear you may be\r\n    induced to fire on the Americans. No, brothers, never make this\r\n    mistake. Rather blow out your own brains than treat with enmity\r\n    those who are your liberators.\r\n\r\n    Your natural enemies, your executioners, the authors of your\r\n    misery and your woe, are the Spaniards who rule you. Raise\r\n    against these your weapons and your hatred. Understand well,\r\n    against the Spaniards; never against the Americans. Do not\r\n    heed the Governor-General's decree, calling you to arms, even\r\n    though it cost you your lives. Die rather than be ungrateful\r\n    to our American liberators. The Governor-General calls you\r\n    to arms. Why? To defend your Spanish tyrants? To defend those\r\n    who have despised you and in public speeches called for your\r\n    extermination--those who have treated you little better than\r\n    savages? No! no! a thousand times, no!\r\n\r\n    Glance at history and you will see that in all Spain's wars\r\n    undertaken in the Far East, Philippine blood has been sacrificed;\r\n    we were sent to fight for the French in Cochin China over a\r\n    matter which in no way concerned us; we were forced by Simon de\r\n    Anda to spill our blood against the English, who, in any case,\r\n    would have been better rulers than the Spaniards; every year our\r\n    sons are taken away to be sacrificed in Mindanao and Sulu against\r\n    those who, we are led to believe, are our enemies when, in reality,\r\n    they are our brothers, fighting, like us, for their liberty. After\r\n    such a sacrifice of blood against the English, the Annamites,\r\n    the Mindanaos, etc., what reward or thanks have we received from\r\n    the Spanish Government? Obscurity, poverty, the slaughter of our\r\n    dear ones. Enough, brothers, of this Spanish tutelage!\r\n\r\n    Note that the Americans will attack by sea and prevent any\r\n    reinforcements coming from Spain, therefore the insurgents must\r\n    attack by land.\r\n\r\n    You will, probably, have more than sufficient arms, because the\r\n    Americans, having arms, will find means to help us. Wherever\r\n    you see the American flag, there flock in numbers. They are\r\n    our redeemers.\r\n\r\n    Our unworthy names are nothing, but we all invoke the name of the\r\n    greatest patriot our country has seen, certain in the hope that\r\n    his spirit will be with us and guide us to victory, our immortal\r\n    _Jose Rizal_.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCavite being occupied by the American forces, foreign Manila residents\r\nwere permitted to take refuge there, for no one could tell when the\r\nSpaniards would be forced to capitulate, or what might happen if they\r\ndid. Meantime the rebels had cut off, to a considerable extent, but\r\nnot entirely, supplies of food to the capital, which was, however,\r\nwell stored; and at no time during the three and a half months'\r\nsiege was there a danger of famine among the civilian population,\r\nalthough prices of commodities gradually advanced to about double\r\nthe normal rates. Even the hotels in the city only charged double\r\nprices. The Spanish troops fared far worse; their condition became\r\nmore and more deplorable. All were badly and insufficiently fed, as\r\nmuch from disorganized commissariat arrangements as from actual want\r\nof supplies. The latest arrivals of youthful raw recruits particularly\r\nfelt the pangs of hunger, and as the swarming rebels took one outpost\r\nafter another from its emaciated defenders and raided the adjacent\r\nprovinces, the Spanish prisoners in their hands (soldiers, friars,\r\nand civil servants) reached the figure of thousands. Among them was\r\nBrig.-General Garcia Pena (lately in command of Cavite), a colonel,\r\nseveral other officers, a civil governor, etc., and some hundreds\r\nof volunteers.\r\n\r\nOf the neutral warships in the bay, Germany had sent the largest\r\nnumber, and the actions of their commanders caused much anxiety to\r\nthe blockading forces. In the city the German Consul made little\r\nsecret of his sympathies for Spain, and was in frequent consultation\r\nwith the Captain-General. German and Spanish officers fraternized\r\nfreely in the streets and cafes. On May 18 a German steamer, with\r\ncargo and provisions, was reported outside Manila Bay, but her entry\r\ninto the port was forbidden by the Americans. Later on the commander\r\nof a German man-of-war and his staff were received and feted by the\r\nCaptain-General. These German officers were invited to a picnic at San\r\nJuan del Monte accompanied by several general and other high Spanish\r\nmilitary officers. The German commander's post-prandial oration at\r\nthe feast was much commented upon, for he is said to have declared\r\n(presumably on his own responsibility) that so long as William II was\r\nEmperor of Germany the Philippines should never come under American\r\nsway. The party then rode back to Manila, watched by the rebels, who\r\nwere too wise to intercept them and so jeopardize their own cause by\r\ncreating international complications. There is little doubt that the\r\nattitude taken up by the Germans nurtured the hope entertained by\r\nSpaniards all over the world, that at the last hour some political\r\nentanglement between the other Powers might operate beneficially for\r\nSpain's interests.\r\n\r\nThe city and commercial suburb of Binondo wore their usual aspect,\r\nalthough trade was almost at a standstill. The undisguised sympathies\r\nof Great Britain for America revived the long dormant feeling of\r\ndistrust and ill-will towards the British residents, which now became\r\nso marked that the Captain-General issued a proclamation commanding due\r\nrespect to be paid to neutral foreigners. Even this did not prevent\r\na Spanish officer spitting in the face of an Englishman. Indeed,\r\nat any time, there was far more danger to all civilian classes from\r\nthe Spanish soldiery than from the rebels, who were strictly enjoined\r\nby Admiral Dewey not to attempt to enter the city. Had they done so,\r\ncertainly their choicest prize would have been the Archbishop Nozaleda,\r\nwho, well aware of this, escaped, long before the capitulation of\r\nthe city, to Shanghai on board the German warship _Darmstadt_.\r\n\r\nThe volunteers, too, were constantly giving trouble to the Spanish\r\nauthorities, from whom they demanded their pay, and once when this\r\nwas refused they threatened to seize the stores.\r\n\r\nAlthough trade in and with Manila had been more or less suspended,\r\nand at intervals absolutely so, since the great naval engagement, just\r\na few profited by the circumstances of war. One British firm there,\r\nfiguratively speaking, \"coined\" money. They were able frequently to\r\nrun a steamer, well known in Chinese waters (in which I have travelled\r\nmyself), between Manila and Hong-Kong carrying refugees, who were\r\nwilling to pay abnormally high rates of passage. In ordinary times\r\nfares ranged from P50 saloon accommodation to P8 a deck passage. On one\r\ntrip, for instance, this steamer, with the cabins filled at P125 each,\r\ncarried 1,200 deck passengers (no food) at P20, and 30 deck passengers\r\n(with food) at P30. Their unsold cargoes on the way in steamers when\r\nManila was blockaded came in for enormously advanced prices. Shiploads\r\nof produce which planters and native middlemen were glad to convert\r\ninto pesos at panic rates were picked up \"dirt cheap,\" leaving\r\nrich profits to the buyers. When steamers could not leave Manila, a\r\nBritisher, Mr. B----, walked for several days under the tropical sun\r\nto embark for Yloilo with trade news, and steamers were run at high\r\nwar rates in and out of Borneo, Hong-Kong, and the Philippine southern\r\nports. One British firm obtained a special licence to run a steamer\r\nbetween Hong-Kong and the port of Dagupan, hitherto closed to foreign\r\ntraffic. These were, naturally, the exceptions, for, upon the whole,\r\nthe dislocation and stoppage of trade entailed very serious losses\r\nto the general body of merchants. A few days after the bombardment of\r\nCavite the natives refused to accept the notes of the _Banco Espanol\r\nFilipino_ (the Spanish bank), and a run was made on the bank to convert\r\nthem into silver. However, the managers of the Hong-Kong and Shanghai\r\nBanking Corporation, and the Chartered Bank of India, Australia, and\r\nChina, came to the rescue of the _Banco Espanol-Filipino_ and agreed\r\nto honour the paper issue in order to check the scare. The three\r\nbanks thereupon opened their doors and satisfied the note-holders,\r\nordinary business being, meanwhile, suspended.\r\n\r\nAguinaldo had not only been busy organizing his forces, but had, in\r\nseveral engagements with the Spaniards, driven them back with loss,\r\nmade prisoners, and replenished his own armouries. He then assumed\r\nthe _Dictatorship_ and issued the following proclamation:--\r\n\r\n\r\n    _Filipinos_:--\r\n\r\n    The Great North American nation, example of true liberty, and,\r\n    as such, the friend of freedom for our country oppressed and\r\n    subjugated by the tyranny and despotism of its rulers, has\r\n    come to offer its inhabitants protection as decisive as it is\r\n    disinterested, regarding our unfortunate country as _gifted with\r\n    sufficient civilization and aptitude for self-government_. In\r\n    order to justify this high conception formed of us by the great\r\n    American nation, we ought to abstain from all acts which would\r\n    destroy that opinion, such as pillage, robbery and every kind of\r\n    outrage against persons or property. So as to avoid international\r\n    conflicts during the period of our campaign I order as follows:--\r\n\r\n    _Article_ 1.--The lives and properties of all foreigners shall\r\n    be respected, including in this denomination the Chinese and all\r\n    Spaniards who have not directly or indirectly contributed to the\r\n    bearing of arms against us.\r\n\r\n    _Article_ 2.--Those of the enemy who shall surrender their arms\r\n    shall be, in like manner, respected.\r\n\r\n    _Article_ 3.--Medical establishments and ambulances shall also be\r\n    respected as well as the persons and effects connected therewith,\r\n    provided they show no hostility.\r\n\r\n    _Article_ 4.--Persons disobeying the above three articles shall\r\n    be summarily tried and executed if their disobedience should lead\r\n    to assassination, incendiarism, robbery or rape.\r\n\r\n    Given at Cavite, May 24, 1898.\r\n\r\n    _Emilio Aguinaldo_.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOn June 8, at 5 p.m., a Philippine deputation, headed by Dr. Santos,\r\nwaited on the American Consul-General in Singapore and delivered to\r\nhim a congratulatory address on the American successes in the war\r\nwith Spain. In reply to this address, the Consul-General made some\r\npleasing remarks which were received with vociferous cheers by the\r\nFilipinos for the President of the United States and all sympathizers\r\nwith their welfare. At the close of the reception a band of Philippine\r\nmusicians played a selection of graceful airs of their native isles.\r\n\r\nWith his despatch No. 229, dated Singapore, June 9, the Consul-General\r\nsent press reports of these proceedings to the Secretary of State in\r\nWashington, who replied as follows [196]:--\r\n\r\n\r\n    No. 87.\r\n\r\n    _Department of State_,\r\n\r\n    _Washington, July_ 20, 1898.\r\n\r\n    _Sir_,--\r\n\r\n    Your No. 229 of the 9th ultimo, inclosing printed copies of\r\n    a report from the _Straits Times_ of the same day ... with a\r\n    view to its communication to the Press, has been received and\r\n    considered. By Department's telegram of the 17th of June you were\r\n    instructed to avoid unauthorized negotiations with the Philippine\r\n    insurgents. The reasons for this instruction were conveyed to you\r\n    in my No. 78 of the 16th of June, by which the President's views\r\n    on the subject of your relations with General Aguinaldo were\r\n    fully expressed. The extract now communicated by you from the\r\n    _Straits Times_ of the 9th of June, has occasioned a feeling of\r\n    disquietude and a doubt as to whether some of your acts may not\r\n    have borne a significance and produced an impression which this\r\n    Government would be compelled to regret. The address presented\r\n    to you by the 25 or 30 Filipinos who gathered about the consulate\r\n    discloses an understanding on their part that the object of Admiral\r\n    Dewey was to support the cause of General Aguinaldo, and that the\r\n    ultimate object of our action is to secure the independence of\r\n    the Philippines \"under the protection of the United States.\" Your\r\n    address does not repel this implication, and it moreover represents\r\n    that General Aguinaldo was \"sought out by you,\" whereas it had\r\n    been the understanding of the Department that you received him\r\n    only upon the request of a British subject ... who formerly lived\r\n    in the Philippines. Your further reference to General Aguinaldo\r\n    as \"the man for the occasion\" and to your \"bringing about\" the\r\n    \"arrangement\" between \"General Aguinaldo and Admiral Dewey which\r\n    has resulted so happily\" also represents the matter in a light\r\n    which causes apprehension lest your action may have laid the\r\n    ground of future misunderstandings and complications. For these\r\n    reasons the Department has not caused the article to be given to\r\n    the Press, lest it might seem thereby to lend a sanction to views,\r\n    the expression of which it had not authorized.\r\n\r\n    Respectfully yours,\r\n\r\n    _William R. Day_.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDuring the first few weeks following the Cavite naval battle nothing\r\nremarkable occurred between the belligerents. The British Consul\r\nand Vice-Consul were indefatigable in the services they rendered\r\nas intermediaries between Admiral Dewey and General Augusti. The\r\nAmerican fleet was well supplied with coal from British vessels. The\r\nManila-Dagupan Railway was in working order, and bringing supplies\r\ninto the city. The Spanish authorities issued a decree regulating the\r\nprice of meat and other commodities. American vessels made occasional\r\ntrips outside the Bay, and brought in captive sailing-vessels. Neutral\r\npassenger-steamers were allowed to take away refugees other than\r\nSpanish subjects. The rebels outside Manila were very active in the\r\nwork of burning and pillaging churches and other property. Streams\r\nof smoke were daily seen rising from the valleys. In the outskirts\r\nof the city, skirmishes between Spanish troops and rebels were of\r\nfrequent occurrence. The Spaniards still managed to preserve routes\r\nof communication with the country districts, although, little by\r\nlittle, the rebels were closing in upon them. Aguinaldo and his\r\nsubordinate leaders were making strenuous efforts effectually to cut\r\noff all supplies to the city, with the view of co-operating with the\r\nAmericans to starve the Spaniards into capitulation. The hospitals in\r\nthe capital were crowded with wounded soldiers, brought in at great\r\nrisk from the rural districts. Spanish soldiers sauntered about the\r\ncity and Binondo--sad spectacles of emaciation in which body and soul\r\nwere only kept together by small doles of rice and dried fish. The\r\nvolunteers who had enlisted on the conditions of pay, food, and\r\nclothing, raised an unheeded cry of protest, and threatened revolt,\r\nwhilst the officers whiled away the time in the cafes with resigned\r\nindifference. The Archbishop issued his Pastoral Letter, in which he\r\ntold the natives that if the foreigners obtained possession of the\r\nIslands there would be an end to all they most dearly cherished. Their\r\naltars would be desecrated; the churches would become temples of\r\nheresy; Christian morality would be banished, and vice would become\r\nrampant. He reminded them (with the proviso \"circumstances permitting\")\r\nthat he had appointed June 17 as the day on which the consecration\r\nof these Islands to the \"Heart of Jesus\" would be solemnly confirmed.\r\n\r\nTo draw the remnant of loyalty to his side, the Gov.-General instituted\r\na reformed \"Consulting Assembly\" composed of 15 half-castes and\r\nnatives, under the nominal presidency of Pedro A. Paterno, the\r\nmediator in the Biac-na-bato negotiations. Senor Paterno, whose\r\nsympathy for Spain was still unalienated, issued a _Manifiesto_\r\nof which the following is a translation (published in _El Comercio_\r\nof Manila on June 2, 1898):--\r\n\r\n\r\n    _Filipinos: Beloved Brethren_.\r\n\r\n    I love our country as none other does. I want it to be great,\r\n    free, and happy, and to shape its own destinies according to\r\n    its desires and aspirations. Therefore, I respect all the vital\r\n    forces in it at the cost of my life and my fortune. A long time\r\n    ago I risked my existence for the rights and liberties of the\r\n    Philippine people, who were sorely agitated, by bringing the\r\n    majority together, and directing the salvation of their interests\r\n    based on liberty and justice. My ideas are neither strange nor new;\r\n    they are the _result of study and political experience,_ and not\r\n    recently conceived under the existing circumstances. I desire,\r\n    with all the vehemence of my soul, to see my country strong and\r\n    great--its honour and dignity respected and in the enjoyment\r\n    of the greatest happiness. But however great our efforts may be\r\n    we need an ally. Let us imitate the example of the Great Powers;\r\n    they cannot exist alone, however strong and great they may be. They\r\n    need help, and the union of strength increases their power. Russia\r\n    seeks France; Germany seeks Italy and Austria. Unhappy is the Power\r\n    that isolates itself! And what better ally can we have than Spain,\r\n    a nation with which we are united for nearly four centuries in\r\n    religion, laws, morals, and customs, understanding full well her\r\n    virtues and her defects? The evil days of Spanish colonization are\r\n    over, and by dint of experience and the sacrifice of blood Spain\r\n    has understood that we are already of age, and require reforms\r\n    in our territory such as the formation of Philippine Militia,\r\n    which gives us the force of arms, and the Consulting Assembly,\r\n    which gives us the power of speech, participation in the higher\r\n    public employments, and the ability to control the peaceful\r\n    development and progress of society. Spain is at war with the\r\n    United States; we neither know that nation nor its language. The\r\n    Americans will endeavour by all imaginable means to induce us to\r\n    help them against Spain. And then, alas! they, the all-powerful,\r\n    will absorb us and reward our treachery to Spain by betraying\r\n    us, making us slaves and imposing upon us all the evils of a new\r\n    colonization. On the other hand, by helping Spain, if we die, we\r\n    do so in the fulfilment of our duty; if we live, we shall obtain\r\n    the triumph of our aspirations without the dangers and risks of\r\n    a civil war. We shall not die! No! Under the flag which shields\r\n    us and our garrisons, fighting with faith, decision, and ardour,\r\n    as a country does which yearns to be free and great, the enemy\r\n    will disappear like the wave which washes the seashore. Let us\r\n    hope to obtain from Spain all the good that the American stranger\r\n    can offer to us. Let us help our old ally, our old friend Spain,\r\n    and realize, with her, more quickly our aspirations. These are\r\n    they:--With the greatest decentralization possible consistent with\r\n    national unity, the organization and attributions of public powers\r\n    must be based on three principles:--(1) Spanish sovereignty. (2)\r\n    Local representation. (3) Colonial Government responsibility. Three\r\n    institutions correspond to these three principles, viz.: (1)\r\n    The institution of the General Government of the Philippines. (2)\r\n    The Insular Deputation or Philippine Assembly. (3) The Governative\r\n    Council. In this way the rights of the Government and those of\r\n    the Colony are harmonized. Let us shun the policy of suspicion\r\n    and doubt. With these firm and solid guarantees let us establish\r\n    civil and political liberty. The Assembly, representing the will of\r\n    the people, deliberates and resolves as one would treat one's own\r\n    affairs in private life, and thus constitutes the legislative power\r\n    of the Archipelago. Its resolution will be put into practice with\r\n    all fidelity by the executive power in its character of responsible\r\n    government. There are only Spaniards in the Archipelago; we are all\r\n    Filipinos and all European Spaniards. Such is _the programme of\r\n    the party who want home rule for the Philippines--ever Spanish!_\r\n    Thus shall we see the destinies of this country guided under the\r\n    orange and red flag. Thus will my beloved country be governed,\r\n    without detriment to the integrity of Spain. Finally, under Spain\r\n    our future is clear, and with all certainty we shall be free and\r\n    rule. Under the Americans our future is cloudy; we shall certainly\r\n    be sold and lose our unity; some provinces will become English,\r\n    others German, others French, others Russian or Chinese. Let us\r\n    struggle, therefore, side by side with Spain, we who love the\r\n    Philippines united and free. Long live Spain!\r\n\r\n    _Pedro Alejandro Paterno_.\r\n    _Manila_, _31st of May_, 1898.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThis _Manifiesto_ was replied to a week later by the rebel party,\r\nwho published a Refutation, of which the following is a translation:--\r\n\r\n\r\n    _Refutation_ of the _Manifiesto_ of Senor Paterno.\r\n\r\n    \"Actions speak louder than words.\"\r\n\r\n    A better phrase, or idea, could not be found with which to reply\r\n    to the _Manifiesto_ of Don Pedro A. Paterno, published in _El\r\n    Comercio_ of the 2nd instant, than the epigraph which heads\r\n    these lines.\r\n\r\n    Senor Paterno begins by saying that he loves his country as\r\n    none other does; he wants it to be great, free, and happy,\r\n    and to shape its own destinies according to its own desires and\r\n    aspirations. _Would to God such beautiful language represented\r\n    the truth_, for it is just what we wish and what we have, long\r\n    ago, been aiming at, at the risk of our lives and property,\r\n    as proved by our actions and our arguments, especially since\r\n    the middle of the glorious year of 1896, the period in which we\r\n    commenced the conquest, by force of arms, of our most cherished\r\n    liberties. May Senor Paterno forgive us if we cite a little of\r\n    the history of this movement, so that he may see that neither\r\n    are we ungrateful, nor are we acting with precipitation, but as\r\n    a logical and undeniable consequence of the vile conduct and bad\r\n    faith of the Spanish Government.\r\n\r\n    For over 300 years the country slumbered in ignorance of all that\r\n    referred to its rights and political liberties. It was resigned to\r\n    the Spanish governmental system of spoliation, and no one thought\r\n    of reforms. But when the Revolution of September, 1868, broke\r\n    out in Spain and overthrew the throne of Isabella II., the first\r\n    revolutionary leaders, inspired by ideas of humanity and justice,\r\n    caused an Assembly of Reformists to be established here, one of\r\n    the members of which, if we remember rightly, was Don Maximo Molo\r\n    Paterno, father of Don Pedro. The Assembly agreed to and proposed\r\n    good and appropriate reforms, amongst which was that relating\r\n    to the incumbencies which were monopolized by the friars. What\r\n    did the Spanish Government do with these reforms? What did the\r\n    friars do? Ah! though it may appear cruel to Senor Paterno,\r\n    historical facts oblige us to remind him that the Government,\r\n    in agreement with the friars, engineered the military rising\r\n    of the City of Cavite in January, 1872, and at the instigation\r\n    of its authors and accomplices, sentenced the secular priests\r\n    Father Jose Burgos, Father Jacinto Zamora, Father Mariano Gomez,\r\n    parish priests of Manila, Santa Cruz (suburb), and Bacoor (Cavite)\r\n    respectively, to be garotted. Moreover, another secular priest,\r\n    Father Agustin, the Philippine lawyers and landed proprietors, Don\r\n    Joaquin Pardo de Tavera, Don Antonio Regidor, Don Pedro Carrillo,\r\n    Don Jose Basa, and others, amongst whom was Don Maximo Molo\r\n    Paterno, the father of Don Pedro, were banished to the Ladrone\r\n    Islands. This virtuous grand old man (Don Maximo Paterno) did\r\n    indeed (and we proclaim it with pride) make sacrifices of health\r\n    and fortune for the advancement of the liberties of his native\r\n    country. From the year 1872 the Spanish Government carried on a\r\n    persistent persecution of all the Philippine reformers by unjust\r\n    imprisonment and banishment. In 1888 the authorities went so far\r\n    as to prosecute 700 representative men of the suburbs of Manila,\r\n    simply for having presented a petition of rights and aspirations\r\n    to the Gov.-General Don Emilio Terrero. There is not a single\r\n    insalubrious island or gloomy corner in the country which has not\r\n    been the forced home of some banished Filipino. No one was sure\r\n    of his personal liberty; none were safe in their homes, and if\r\n    three or four Filipinos met together for an innocent purpose,\r\n    they were spied, arrested, and banished. Calumny has brought\r\n    about enough banishments to Fernando Po, Chafarinas Islands,\r\n    Ceuta, and other African and Spanish places to demonstrate the\r\n    bad faith, cruelty, and injustice of the Spanish Government with\r\n    respect to the Philippine people. This virile, intelligent people\r\n    received the supreme decree of reforms with joy and enthusiasm,\r\n    sharing the feelings of those who felt in their souls the flame\r\n    of liberty. This people worked, through legitimate channels, to\r\n    advance its ideal, inspired by the purest loyalty to Spain. How\r\n    did the Spanish Government fulfil, on its part, the decree\r\n    spontaneously issued in 1868? By prosecuting and banishing the\r\n    reformists, and employing a system of terror to damp the courage\r\n    of the Filipinos. Vain, ridiculous fallacy!--for it ought to\r\n    have known better after three centuries of rule of that country\r\n    of intelligence, birthplace of Rizal, Luna, Rosario and other\r\n    living examples of Philippine energy. The Filipinos, lovers\r\n    of their liberty and independence, had no other recourse open\r\n    to them than an appeal to arms, to bring force against force,\r\n    terror against terror, death for death, resolute and sworn to\r\n    practise the system of fire and blood, until they should attain\r\n    for the whole Philippine Archipelago absolute freedom from the\r\n    ignominious sovereignty of Spain. Now let us continue our comments\r\n    on the _Manifiesto_.\r\n\r\n    Senor Paterno says that a long time ago he risked his existence\r\n    for the rights and liberties of the Philippine people, even at\r\n    the cost of his health and his fortune. We, however, do not see\r\n    how he put into practice such magnificent ideas, for what we do\r\n    know is that Senor Paterno passed his younger days in Madrid,\r\n    where, by dint of lavish expenditure, he was very well treated\r\n    by the foremost men in Spanish politics, without gaining from\r\n    Spain anything whereby the Philippine people were made free and\r\n    happy during that long period of his brilliant existence. On\r\n    the contrary, the very epoch of the persecutions narrated above\r\n    coincided with the period of Don Pedro A. Paterno's brilliant\r\n    position and easy life in Madrid, where, because he published a\r\n    collection of poems under the title of \"Sampaguitas,\" he became\r\n    distinguished by the nickname of _Sampaguitero_. We know, also,\r\n    that Senor Paterno came back to this, his native soil, appointed\r\n    director of a Philippine Library and Museum not yet established,\r\n    without salary, but with the decoration of the Grand Cross of\r\n    Isabella the Catholic. This was no gain to us, no distinction to\r\n    him, seeing that the same decoration was given to the Chinaman\r\n    Palanca and two others, without their leaving their homes to\r\n    obtain them.\r\n\r\n    How are we then to understand those generous sacrifices of health\r\n    and fortune for the cause of Philippine liberty? Perhaps he\r\n    refers to the recently created Philippine Militia and Consulting\r\n    Assembly. Well, admitting for argument sake, that with such\r\n    Militia and Consulting Assembly the liberty and happiness of the\r\n    Philippines were assured (a doubtful hypothesis, Senor Paterno),\r\n    this happiness is not due to Senor Paterno's efforts, but simply\r\n    to the circumstances. Spain is at war with North America, and\r\n    now offers us this sugar-plum to draw us to her side to defend\r\n    her against invasion.\r\n\r\n    We ask you again, Senor Paterno, where are those sacrifices?\r\n\r\n    We do not see them, although we seek them with the light of\r\n    impartiality, for, as the splendour of justice shines on our flag,\r\n    we should not fail to do this even for our greatest enemies,\r\n    amongst whom we do not count you.\r\n\r\n    Do you allude to the Peace of Biac-na-bato? If so, we ask, what\r\n    have you done with that peace to which we subscribed in good\r\n    faith, and which you and General Primo de Rivera together have\r\n    stupidly and scandalously torn into shreds? You have, indeed,\r\n    bungled the amnesty when many of the banished are, up to now,\r\n    suffering the miseries of their sad and unjust fate.\r\n\r\n    You have put off the promised reforms which, even yet, have\r\n    not come.\r\n\r\n    You have delayed the payment of the P400,000 for the second and\r\n    third instalments of the agreed sum.\r\n\r\n    You have not delivered into the hands of our chief, Don Emilio\r\n    Aguinaldo, the money as agreed upon.\r\n\r\n    Ah! You thought that when we had surrendered to you our arms and\r\n    our garrisoned strongholds--when our forces were dispersed and we\r\n    were absent--you could turn back to the Government of iniquity\r\n    without reflecting that Divine Providence could permit, in the\r\n    hour of great injustice, her emissary Don Emilio Aguinaldo to\r\n    return resolved to chastise energetically the immoral and impotent\r\n    Spanish Government.\r\n\r\n    Then comes Senor Paterno, telling us that however great our efforts\r\n    may be in the cause of liberty, we cannot live without an ally,\r\n    and that we can find no better alliance than the sovereignty of\r\n    Spain. Frankly, we must say that this is inconceivably incompatible\r\n    with Senor Paterno's clear intelligence. How do you understand an\r\n    alliance with sovereignty? How can you imagine a people great,\r\n    free and happy under the sovereignty of Spain? Senor Paterno\r\n    cites, as examples, the alliances between Russia and France,\r\n    Germany and Italy and Austria, but, so far, we do not know that\r\n    Russia is the sovereign power of the French, nor the Germans that\r\n    of the Italians and Austrians. Senor Paterno further says that by\r\n    helping Spain in the war with the United States, if we die, we do\r\n    so in the fulfilment of our duty; if we live, we shall obtain the\r\n    triumph of our aspirations without the dangers and risks of a civil\r\n    war. Know, Senor Paterno, and let all know, that in less than six\r\n    days' operations in several provinces we have already taken 1,500\r\n    prisoners, amongst whom is the Brigadier-General Garcia Pena,\r\n    one Colonel, several Lieutenant-Colonels, Majors and officers,\r\n    besides the Governor of the Province of Bulacan, his wife and all\r\n    the civil service staff of that province. We also have about 500\r\n    Philippine volunteers as prisoners, of whom 10 have died and 40\r\n    are wounded, whilst among the European prisoners there is only one\r\n    wounded. This goes to prove that the Europeans were too cowardly\r\n    to defend the sovereignty of Spain in these Islands, therefore we\r\n    do not understand the appeal you make to the Filipinos to defend\r\n    Spain as a duty, when the Spaniards themselves are heedless of\r\n    that which ought to be a more rigorous and strict obligation\r\n    with them, seeing that they defend their own possession which\r\n    brings them so much lucre and profit. This does not say much for\r\n    the duty when the favoured ones themselves forget it and trample\r\n    upon it. To die to-day for cowardly Spain! This implies not only\r\n    want of dignity and delicate feeling, but also gross stupidity in\r\n    weaving a sovereignty of frightened Spaniards over the heads of\r\n    brave Filipinos. It is astonishing that in the face of such an\r\n    eloquent example of impotence there should still be a Filipino\r\n    who defends the sovereignty of Spain.\r\n\r\n    Remember, Senor Paterno, that we make war without the help of any\r\n    one, not even the North Americans; but no! we have the help of God,\r\n    who is the eternal ally of the great and just causes such as that\r\n    which we defend against Spain--our own beloved _independence_!!!\r\n\r\n    Senor Paterno concludes by explaining his political and\r\n    administrative principles on the basis of Spanish sovereignty, but,\r\n    as we have charged that sovereignty with cowardice and immorality,\r\n    we dismiss this detail.\r\n\r\n    To conclude, we will draw the attention of Senor Paterno to two\r\n    things, viz.:\r\n\r\n    1. That he _commits an injustice in imputing to the North Americans\r\n    the intention of taking possession of these Islands_ as soon as we\r\n    have conquered the Spaniards, for, besides having no grounds on\r\n    which to make such an allegation against a nation distinguished\r\n    for its humanity like the Federal Republic, there is the fact\r\n    that _its own constitution prohibits the absorption of territory\r\n    outside America, _in accordance with that principle laid down\r\n    by the immortal Monroe, of America for the Americans. There is,\r\n    moreover, the historical antecedent that the independence of\r\n    South America, once under Spanish dominion, is largely due to\r\n    the protection of the United States; and\r\n\r\n    2. That Senor Paterno should reflect on the fact that the Spaniards\r\n    would never have allowed him to publish his _Manifiesto_ had it not\r\n    been for the existence and attitude of our Dictator, Don Emilio\r\n    Aguinaldo. This ought to serve Senor Paterno as further proof of\r\n    the cowardice of the Spaniards, who, notwithstanding all that has\r\n    been shown, insist on creating discord by provoking civil war:\r\n    on their heads will fall the responsibilities of the moment and\r\n    of the historical past.\r\n\r\n    _Cavite_, _9th of June_, 1898.\r\n\r\n    _The Revolutionists_.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe feeling against Don Pedro A. Paterno in the rebel camp was very\r\nstrong for the time being, because of his supposed complicity in the\r\nalleged Biac-na-bato fraud.\r\n\r\nThe rebels stopped all the traffic on the Tondo-Malabon steam tramway\r\nline, and shortly afterwards the Manila-Dagupan railway trains had\r\ntemporarily to cease running.\r\n\r\nOn June 10, 1898, General Monet received, through a Chinaman,\r\na message from the Gov.-General to hasten to Manila with all\r\nthe force he could bring. Monet had been so long in the northern\r\nprovinces unsuccessfully trying to hold them against the rebels\r\nthat his fate was, for a time, despaired of in the capital. Hemmed\r\nin on all sides by the enemy, concentration of all his detachments\r\nfor general retreat was impossible. The forces spread over Tarlac,\r\nNorth Pangasinan and Nueva Ecija had to be left to their fate; their\r\njunction was quite impracticable, for, surrounded everywhere by\r\nthe enemy, each group was then only just able to defend itself, and\r\nsubsequently most of them fell prisoners. With only 600 fighting men,\r\nescorting 80 wounded, General Monet set out on his terrible southward\r\nmarch amidst recurring scenes of woe and despair. At every few miles\r\nbetween San Fernando and Macabebe his progress was hampered by an\r\never-increasing terror-stricken, weeping crowd of European women\r\nand children who besought him not to let them fall into the hands\r\nof a revengeful enemy. In the course of his march at most another\r\nhundred fighting men, a few of whom were natives, were able to join the\r\nretreating column. Their ammunition was scarce; they had no artillery\r\nwaggons; every _carromata_ (gig) of the districts traversed had been\r\nseized by the enemy. Near San Fernando his passage was disputed,\r\nbut he entered the town, nevertheless, and evacuated it immediately\r\nafter, having secured only 12 carts for the transport of the sick\r\nand the wounded and what little remained of the war-material. The\r\ngreatest difficulty was how to feed the swelling mob of refugees. At\r\n6 a.m. on June 14 a start was made for Santo Tomas, but they were\r\nso fiercely attacked on the road that, for the moment, annihilation\r\nseemed inevitable. Concentrated between Apalit, Santo Tomas, Bacolor,\r\nand Mexico the rebel forces were estimated at 9,000 well-armed men,\r\nbetween whom Monet's column had to pass or die. The sobs of the\r\nchildren, the lamentations of the women, the invocation of the saints\r\nby the helpless were drowned in the united yelling of half-starved\r\ntroopers in their almost superhuman struggle for existence. Fortunately\r\nthe best order possible, under such distressing circumstances, was\r\nmaintained by the splendid officers supporting Monet. They were men\r\npersonally known to many of us years before. Lieut.-Colonel Dujiols\r\ncommanded the vanguard; the rearguard was under Major Roberto White;\r\nthe refugee families were in charge of Lieut.-Colonel Oyarzabal, all\r\nunder the superior orders of Colonel Perez Escotado. At length they\r\ncut their way through to Apalit, where the railway station served\r\nthem as a stronghold, which they were able to defend whilst food\r\nwas served out and some attention could be bestowed on the sick and\r\nwounded. On leaving Apalit a group of rebels approached the column\r\nwith a white flag saying they were friendly Macabebes, but when they\r\nwere close enough they opened fire. Nearly the whole town turned out\r\nagainst the fugitives, and Monet had to hasten the march by deploying\r\nhis troops to keep the road clear. Understanding well that Monet was\r\nacting only on the defensive to cover his retreat, the rebels sent him\r\nan audacious message offering to spare the lives of his people if he\r\nwould surrender their arms. The general's reply was in the negative,\r\nadding that if he once reached Santo Tomas not a stick or stone of\r\nit would he leave to mark its site. This defiant answer nonplussed\r\nthe rebels, who had private interests to consider. To save their\r\nproperty they sent another message to General Monet, assuring him\r\nthat he would not be further molested; and to guarantee their promise\r\nthey sent him the son of a headman as hostage, whose life they said\r\nhe could take if they broke their word. That night was, therefore,\r\npassed, without attack, at Mandaling, around which outposts were\r\nestablished and trenches occupied. The following day the retreating\r\ncolumn and the refugees reached Macabebe safely, [197] but what became\r\nof their leader at this crisis we must leave to future historians to\r\nexplain. Some nine months afterwards the acts of two generals were\r\ninquired into by a court of honour in Spain; one of them was disgraced,\r\n[198] and the other, who was accused of having abandoned his whole\r\nparty to escape alone in disguise, was acquitted.\r\n\r\nGeneral Augusti's wife and family were chivalrously escorted\r\nfrom Macabebe, where they were quite safe, by a loyal Philippine\r\nvolunteer named Blanco (the son of a planter in Pampanga), who was\r\nafterwards promoted to effective rank of colonel in Spain. They were\r\nconducted from the Hagonoy marshes to the Bay of Manila and found\r\ngenerous protection from the Americans, who allowed them to quit the\r\nIslands. The Spanish garrisons in the whole of La Laguna and Pampanga\r\nhad surrendered to the rebels, who were in practical possession of\r\ntwo-thirds of Luzon Island. General Augusti was personally inclined\r\nto capitulate, but was dissuaded from doing so by his officers.\r\n\r\nSeveral American generals arrived with reinforcements, more were\r\n_en route_, and about the middle of July the Commander-in-Chief,\r\nMaj.-General Wesley Merritt, reached the Islands and remained\r\nthere until the end of the following month, that is to say, for\r\nabout 10 or 12 days after the Spanish surrender and the American\r\nmilitary occupation of Manila were accomplished facts. On the way\r\nout from San Francisco to Manila some American ships called at the\r\nLadrone Islands and brought the Spanish garrison of about 40 men\r\nprisoners. The surrender of the capital had been again demanded\r\nand refused, for the Spaniards were far from being starved out, and\r\nthe American commander had strictly forbidden Aguinaldo to make an\r\nattack on the city. Aguinaldo, however, had been wonderfully active\r\nelsewhere. In several engagements the Spaniards were completely\r\nrouted, and in one encounter the rebel party took over 350 prisoners,\r\nincluding 28 officers; in another, 250 prisoners and four guns; and 150\r\nSpaniards who fled to Cavite Viejo church were quietly starved into\r\nsurrender. Amongst the prisoners were several provincial governors,\r\none of whom attempted to commit suicide. At Bacoor a hotly-contested\r\nbattle was fought which lasted about nine hours. The Spaniards were\r\nsurprised very early one morning, and by the afternoon they were\r\nforced to retreat along the Cavite-Manila road to Las Pinas. The\r\nSpanish loss amounted approximately to 250 troops wounded, 300 dead,\r\nand 35 officers wounded or dead. The rebels are said to have lost more\r\nthan double this number, but whatever may have been the sacrifice,\r\nthe victory was theirs. The Spaniards would probably have come\r\nbetter out of this combat but for the fact that a native regiment,\r\nhitherto loyal, suddenly murdered their officers and went over to\r\nthe rebels. The Spaniards undoubtedly suffered much from unexpected\r\nmutinies of native auxiliaries and volunteers at critical moments,\r\nwhilst in no case did rebels pass over to the Spanish side. [199]\r\nThey were not long left in possession of Las Pinas, where a subsequent\r\nattack in overwhelming numbers drove the survivors still nearer to\r\nthe capital.\r\n\r\nLong before the capitulation of Manila the rebels were as well armed\r\nas they could wish from three sources,--that is to say, the Americans,\r\nthe Spanish arms seized in warfare, and consignments from China. They\r\nalso made good use of their field-pieces, and ever and anon the\r\nbooming of cannon was heard in the streets of Manila. The Spaniards,\r\nhard pressed on all sides, seemed determined to make their last stand\r\nin the old citadel. The British banks shipped away their specie to\r\nChina, and the British community, whose members were never united as\r\nto the course they should adopt for general safety, was much relieved\r\nwhen several steamers were allowed, by the mutual consent of Admiral\r\nDewey and General Augusti, to lie in the bay to take foreigners on\r\nboard in case of bombardment. Emilio Aguinaldo, on his return to the\r\nIslands, had declared himself Dictator. The Dictatorial Government\r\nadministered the provinces as they were conquered from the Spaniards,\r\ncollected taxes, and enacted laws. In a month's time the management\r\nof these rural districts had so far assumed shape that Aguinaldo\r\nconvened deputies therefrom and summoned a Congress on June 18. He\r\nchanged the name of Dictatorial to Revolutionary Government, and on\r\nJune 23 proclaimed the Constitution of that provisional government,\r\nof which the statutes are as follows:--\r\n\r\n\r\n    _(Translation)_\r\n\r\n    _Don Emilio Aguinaldo y Famy_,\r\n\r\n    President of the Philippine Revolutionary Government and\r\n    Commander-in-Chief of its army\r\n\r\n    This Government, desirous of demonstrating to the Philippine\r\n    people that one of its objects is to abolish with a firm hand\r\n    the inveterate vices of Spanish administration, substituting\r\n    a more simple and expeditious system of public administration\r\n    for that superfluity of civil service and ponderous, tardy and\r\n    ostentatious official routine, I hereby declare as follows, viz:--\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER I\r\n\r\n    Chapter I\r\n    Of the Revolutionary Government\r\n\r\n    _Article_ 1.--The Dictatorial Government shall be henceforth called\r\n    the Revolutionary Government, whose object is to struggle for\r\n    the independence of the Philippines, until all nations, including\r\n    Spain, shall expressly recognize it, and to prepare the country\r\n    for the establishment of a real Republic. The Dictator shall be\r\n    henceforth styled the President of the Revolutionary Government.\r\n\r\n    _Article_ 2.--Four Government Secretaryships are created: (1)\r\n    of Foreign Affairs, Navy and Trade; (2) of War and Public Works;\r\n    (3) of Police, Public Order, Justice, Public Education and Health;\r\n    (4) of Finance, Agriculture, and Manufactures. The Government has\r\n    power to increase the number of secretaryships when experience has\r\n    shown that the above distribution of public offices is insufficient\r\n    to meet public requirements.\r\n\r\n    _Article_ 3.--Each Secretary shall assist the President in the\r\n    administration of affairs concerning his particular branch. The\r\n    Secretary at the head of each respective department shall not\r\n    be responsible for the Presidential Decrees, but shall sign the\r\n    same to give them authenticity. But if it should appear that\r\n    the decree has been issued on the proposal of the Secretary of\r\n    the corresponding branch, then the Secretary shall be jointly\r\n    responsible with the President.\r\n\r\n    _Article_ 4.--The Secretaryship of Foreign Affairs shall be\r\n    divided into three centres, one of Diplomacy, one of Navy, and\r\n    another of Trade. The first centre shall study and execute all\r\n    affairs which concern the direction of diplomatic negotiations\r\n    with other Powers and the correspondence of this Government\r\n    connected therewith. The second shall study all that relates to\r\n    the formation and organization of our Navy, and the fitting out\r\n    of whatever expeditions the circumstances of the Revolution may\r\n    require; and the third shall attend to all matters concerning\r\n    home and foreign trade and the preliminary work in connection\r\n    with the Treaties of Commerce to be made with other nations.\r\n\r\n    _Article_ 5.--The Secretaryship of War shall be divided into two\r\n    centres, the one exclusively of War and the other exclusively\r\n    of Public Works. The first centre shall be divided into four\r\n    sections, one of Campaign, one of Military Justice, one of Military\r\n    Administration, and the other of Military Health.\r\n\r\n    The Campaign section shall draw up and attend to all matters\r\n    concerning the service and enlistment of the Revolutionary Militia,\r\n    the direction of campaigns, the making of plans, fortifications,\r\n    and the editing of the announcements of battles, the study of\r\n    military tactics for the Army, and organization of the respective\r\n    staffs, artillery, and cavalry corps, and all other matters\r\n    concerning campaigns and military operations.\r\n\r\n    The section of Military Justice shall attend to all matters\r\n    concerning courts-martial and military sentences, the appointment\r\n    of judges and assistant judges in all military-judicial\r\n    affairs. The military administrator shall take charge of the\r\n    commissariat department and all Army equipment, and the Military\r\n    Health department shall take charge of matters concerning the\r\n    health and salubrity of the Militia.\r\n\r\n    _Article_ 6.--The other secretaryships shall be divided into so\r\n    many centres corresponding to their functions, and each centre\r\n    shall be sub-divided into sections as the nature and importance\r\n    of the work requires.\r\n\r\n    _Article_ 7.--The Secretary of each department shall inspect and\r\n    watch over the work therein and be responsible to the President\r\n    of the Government. At the head of each section there shall be\r\n    a director, and in each section there shall be an official in\r\n    charge assisted by the necessary staff.\r\n\r\n    _Article_ 8.--The President shall have the sole right to appoint\r\n    the secretaries, and in agreement with them he shall appoint all\r\n    the staff subordinate to the respective departments. Nevertheless,\r\n    in the election of individuals favouritism must be avoided on\r\n    the understanding that the good name of the Fatherland and the\r\n    triumph of the Revolution need the services of the most really\r\n    capable persons.\r\n\r\n    _Article_ 9.--The secretaries can take part in the sessions of the\r\n    Revolutionary Congress, whenever they have a motion to present in\r\n    the name of the President, or on the interpellation of any deputy,\r\n    but when the question under debate, or the motion on which they\r\n    have been summoned is put to the vote, they shall retire and not\r\n    take part in that voting.\r\n\r\n    _Article_ 10.--The President of the Government is the\r\n    personification of the Philippine people, and as such he cannot be\r\n    held responsible for any act whilst he holds that position. His\r\n    position is irrevocable until the Revolution shall triumph,\r\n    unless extraordinary circumstances should compel him to tender\r\n    his resignation to Congress, in which case only Congress shall\r\n    elect whomsoever is esteemed most fit.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER 2\r\n\r\n    Chapter II\r\n    Of the Revolutionary Congress\r\n\r\n\r\n    _Article_ 11.--The Revolutionary Congress is the assembly of those\r\n    deputies from the Philippine provinces, elected in due form, as\r\n    prescribed in the Decree of the 18th inst. Nevertheless, if any\r\n    province could not elect deputies because the majority of its towns\r\n    had not yet been able to free themselves from Spanish dominion,\r\n    the Government can nominate provisional deputies chosen from the\r\n    persons of highest consideration by reason of their education\r\n    and social position up to the number fixed by the said Decree,\r\n    always provided that such persons shall have been born or have\r\n    resided for a long time in the provinces to be represented.\r\n\r\n    _Article_ 12.--When the deputies shall have met in the town and\r\n    in the building to be provided by the Revolutionary Government\r\n    the preliminary act shall be the election by majority of votes\r\n    of a commission of five persons who shall examine the documents\r\n    accrediting the personality of each person, and another commission\r\n    of three persons who shall examine the documents exhibited by\r\n    the first commission of five.\r\n\r\n    _Article_ 13.--The next day the said deputies shall again meet\r\n    and the two commissions shall read their respective reports on\r\n    the validity of the said documents, all doubts on the same to\r\n    be resolved by an absolute majority of votes. They shall then\r\n    at once proceed to the election, by absolute majority, of a\r\n    president, a vice-president, and two secretaries, to be chosen\r\n    from among the same deputies, after which the Congress shall be\r\n    held to be constituted, and notice of the same shall be given to\r\n    the Government.\r\n\r\n    _Article_ 14.--The meeting-place of Congress is sacred and\r\n    inviolable, and no armed force can enter therein except on the\r\n    summons of the President of the Congress for the purpose of\r\n    restoring order, should the same have been disturbed by those\r\n    who know not how to honour themselves and their solemn functions.\r\n\r\n    _Article_ 15.--The powers of Congress are:--To look after the\r\n    general interests of the Philippine people and the fulfilment of\r\n    the revolutionary laws; to discuss and vote laws; to discuss and\r\n    approve, before ratification, all treaties and loans to examine\r\n    and approve the accounts of the general expenses which shall\r\n    be presented annually by the Finance Secretary and to fix the\r\n    extraordinary taxes, and others which, in future, may be imposed.\r\n\r\n    _Article_ 16.--The voice of Congress shall also be heard in all\r\n    matters of grave importance the resolution of which will admit of\r\n    delay, but the President of the Government can resolve questions of\r\n    an urgent character, rendering an account of his acts to Congress\r\n    by means of a message.\r\n\r\n    _Article_ 17.--Any Deputy can present a bill in Congress, and any\r\n    Secretary can do so by order of the President of the Government.\r\n\r\n    _Article_ 18.--The sessions of Congress shall be public, and only\r\n    in cases where reserve is necessary shall secret sessions be held.\r\n\r\n    _Article_ 19.--The order of debate and parliamentary usages shall\r\n    be determined by instructions to be formulated by Congress. The\r\n    President shall lead the debate, but shall not vote, unless\r\n    there fail to be a majority, in which case he shall give his\r\n    casting vote.\r\n\r\n    _Article_ 20.--The President of the Government cannot, in any\r\n    manner, impede the meeting of Congress, nor interfere with the\r\n    sessions of the same.\r\n\r\n    _Article_ 21.--Congress shall appoint a permanent judicial\r\n    commission, to be presided over by the Vice-President, assisted\r\n    by one of the Secretaries and composed of these persons and\r\n    seven assessors, elected by majority of votes, from among the\r\n    deputies. This commission shall revise the sentences given in\r\n    criminal cases by the provincial councils, and shall judge and\r\n    sentence, without right of further appeal, cases brought against\r\n    the Government Secretaries, Provincial Chiefs and Provincial\r\n    Councillors.\r\n\r\n    _Article_ 22.--In the office of the Secretary to Congress there\r\n    shall be a Book of Honour, in which shall be noted the great\r\n    services rendered to the Fatherland and esteemed as such by\r\n    Congress. Any Filipino, military or civil, can solicit of Congress\r\n    inscription in the said book on producing the documents which\r\n    prove the praiseworthy acts performed by him for the good of the\r\n    Fatherland since the present Revolution began. For extraordinary\r\n    services which may, in future, be rendered, the Government will\r\n    propose the inscription, the proposal being accompanied by the\r\n    necessary justification.\r\n\r\n    _Article_ 23.--Congress shall determine, on the proposal of the\r\n    Government, the money rewards to be paid, once for all, to the\r\n    families of those who were victims to duty and patriotism in the\r\n    execution of heroic acts.\r\n\r\n    _Article_ 24.--The resolutions of Congress shall not be binding\r\n    until they have received the sanction of the President of the\r\n    Government. When the said President shall consider any resolution\r\n    undesirable, or impracticable, or pernicious, he shall state his\r\n    reasons to Congress for opposing its execution, and if Congress\r\n    still insist on the resolution the said President can outvote it\r\n    on his own responsibility.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III\r\n\r\n    Chapter III\r\n    Of Military Justice\r\n\r\n\r\n    _Article_ 25.--When any commandant of a detachment shall receive\r\n    notice of an individual in the service having committed a fault or\r\n    having performed any act reputed to be a military misdemeanour,\r\n    he shall inform the Commandant of the District of the same, and\r\n    this officer shall appoint a judge and secretary to constitute\r\n    a Court of Inquiry in the form prescribed in the instructions\r\n    dated 20th instant. If the accused held the rank of lieutenant,\r\n    or a higher one, the same Commandant shall be the judge, and if the\r\n    Commandant himself were the accused the Superior Commandant of the\r\n    Province shall appoint as judge an officer of a higher rank, and\r\n    if there were none such the same Commandant of the Province shall\r\n    open the inquiry. The judge shall always hold the rank of chief.\r\n\r\n    _Article_ 26.--When the Court of Inquiry has finished its labours,\r\n    the Superior Commandant shall appoint three assistant judges of\r\n    equal or superior rank to the judge, and a Court-Martial shall be\r\n    composed of the three assistant judges, the judge, the assessor,\r\n    and the president. The Commandant of the District shall be the\r\n    judge if the accused held the rank of sergeant, or a lower one,\r\n    and the Superior Commandant shall be judge if the accused held the\r\n    rank of lieutenant, or a higher one. This court shall pass sentence\r\n    in the same form as the Provincial Courts, but the sentence can\r\n    be appealed against before the Superior Council of War.\r\n\r\n    _Article 27_.--The Superior Council of War shall be composed\r\n    of six assistant judges, who shall hold the minimum rank of\r\n    Brigadier-General, and the War Office adviser. If the number of\r\n    generals residing in the capital of the Revolutionary Government\r\n    be insufficient, the number shall be made up by deputies to\r\n    be appointed on commission by Congress. The President of this\r\n    Council shall be the general of the highest rank amongst them,\r\n    and if there were more than one of the same rank, one shall be\r\n    elected by themselves by majority of votes.\r\n\r\n    _Article 28_.--The Superior Council shall judge and sentence,\r\n    without right of further appeal, Superior Commandants, Commandants\r\n    of Districts, and all officers who hold rank of Commandant,\r\n    or a higher one.\r\n\r\n    _Article 29_.--Military misdemeanours are the following:--\r\n\r\n    (1) Violation of the immunity due to foreigners, both as to\r\n    their persons and their goods, and violation of the privileges\r\n    appertaining to sanitary establishments and ambulances, as well\r\n    as the persons and effects in, or belonging to, one or the other,\r\n    and persons employed in the service of the same so long as they\r\n    commit no hostile act. (2) Want of respect for the lives, money,\r\n    and jewellery of the enemy who surrenders his arms, and for\r\n    prisoners of war. (3) The entry of Filipinos into the service of\r\n    the enemy as spies, or to discover war secrets, make plans of the\r\n    revolutionists' positions and fortifications, or present themselves\r\n    to parley without proving their mission or their individuality. (4)\r\n    Violation of the immunity due to those who come with this mission,\r\n    duly accredited, in the form prescribed by international law.\r\n\r\n    The following persons also commit military misdemeanours:--\r\n\r\n    (1) Those who endeavour to break up the union of the\r\n    revolutionists, fomenting rivalry between the chiefs, and forming\r\n    divisions and armed bands. (2) Those who collect taxes without\r\n    being duly authorized by Government, or misappropriate public\r\n    funds. (3) Those who, being armed, surrender to the enemy or\r\n    commit any act of cowardice before the same; and (4) Those who\r\n    sequester any person who has done no harm to the Revolution, or\r\n    violate women, or assassinate, or seriously wound any undefended\r\n    persons, or commit robbery or arson.\r\n\r\n    _Article_ 30.--Those who commit any of the above-named\r\n    misdemeanours shall be considered declared enemies of the\r\n    Revolution and shall be punished on the highest scale of punishment\r\n    provided for in the Spanish Penal Code. If the misdemeanour be\r\n    not provided for in the said code, the culprit shall be confined\r\n    until the Revolution has triumphed, unless his crime shall have\r\n    caused an irreparable injury which, in the opinion of the court,\r\n    would justify the imposition of capital punishment.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n    Additional Clauses\r\n\r\n\r\n    _Article_ 31.--The Government shall establish abroad a\r\n    Revolutionary Committee, composed of an indefinite number of\r\n    the most competent persons in the Philippine Archipelago. This\r\n    Committee shall be divided into three sections, viz.:--Of\r\n    diplomacy; of the navy; and of the army. The diplomatic section\r\n    shall negotiate with the foreign cabinets the recognition of\r\n    belligerency and Philippine independence. The naval section shall\r\n    be intrusted with the study and organization of a Philippine\r\n    navy and prepare the expeditions which the circumstances of the\r\n    Revolution may require. The army section shall study military\r\n    tactics and the best form of organizing staff, artillery and\r\n    engineer corps, and all that is necessary to put the Philippine\r\n    army on a footing of modern advancement.\r\n\r\n    _Article_ 32.--The Government shall dictate the necessary\r\n    instructions for the execution of the present decree.\r\n\r\n    _Article_ 33.--All decrees of the Dictatorial Government which\r\n    may be in opposition to the present one are hereby rescinded.\r\n\r\n\r\n    Given at Cavite, June 23, 1898.\r\n\r\n    _Emilio Aguinaldo_.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Promulgation of the Constitution of the Revolutionary Government\r\nwas accompanied by a Message from Emilio Aguinaldo, of which the\r\nfollowing is a translation:--\r\n\r\n\r\n    _Message of the President of the Philippine Revolution_\r\n\r\n    It is an established fact that a political Revolution, judiciously\r\n    carried out, is the violent means employed by nations to recover\r\n    the sovereignty which naturally belongs to them, when the same has\r\n    been usurped and trodden under foot by tyrannical and arbitrary\r\n    government. Therefore, the Philippine Revolution cannot be more\r\n    justifiable than it is, because the country has only resorted\r\n    to it after having exhausted all peaceful means which reason and\r\n    experience dictated.\r\n\r\n    The old Kings of Castile were obliged to regard the Philippines\r\n    as a sister nation united to Spain by a perfect similarity\r\n    of aims and interests, so much so that in the Constitution of\r\n    1812, promulgated at Cadiz, as a consequence of the Spanish War\r\n    of Independence, these Islands were represented in the Spanish\r\n    Parliament. But the monastic communities, always unconditionally\r\n    propped up by the Spanish Government, stepped in to oppose the\r\n    sacred obligation, and the Philippine Islands were excluded from\r\n    the Spanish Constitution, and the country placed at the mercy of\r\n    the discretional or arbitrary powers of the Gov.-General.\r\n\r\n    Under these circumstances the country clamoured for justice,\r\n    and demanded of the Peninsular Government the recognition and\r\n    restitution of its secular rights, through reforms which should\r\n    gradually assimilate it to Spain. But its voice was soon stifled,\r\n    and its children were rewarded for their abnegation by punishment,\r\n    martyrdom and death. The religious corporations, whose interests\r\n    were always at variance with those of the Filipinos and identified\r\n    with the Spanish Government, ridiculed these pretensions, calmly\r\n    and persistently replying that liberty in Spain had only been\r\n    gained by the sacrifice of blood.\r\n\r\n    What other channel, then, was open to the country through which\r\n    to insist upon the recovery of its lawful rights? No other remedy\r\n    remained but the application of force, and convinced of this,\r\n    it had recourse to revolution.\r\n\r\n    Now its demands are no longer limited to assimilation with the\r\n    Spanish Constitution. It asks for a definite separation therefrom;\r\n    it struggles for its independence, with the certainty that the\r\n    time has arrived when it is able and ought to rule itself.\r\n\r\n    Hence, it has constituted a Revolutionary Government, based\r\n    on wise and just laws, suited to the abnormal circumstances\r\n    it is passing through, preparatory to the founding of a real\r\n    Republic. Accepting Right as the only standard of its acts,\r\n    Justice as its sole aim, and honourable Labour as its sole means,\r\n    it calls upon all Filipinos, without distinction of birth, and\r\n    invites them to unite firmly with the object of forming a noble\r\n    society, not by bloodshed, nor by pompous titles, but by labour\r\n    and the personal merit of each one; a free society where no egoism\r\n    shall exist--where no personal politics shall overflow and crush,\r\n    nor envy nor partiality debase, nor vain boasting nor charlatanry\r\n    throw it into ridicule.\r\n\r\n    Nothing else could be expected from a country which has proved\r\n    by its long suffering and courage in tribulation and danger,\r\n    and industry and studiousness in peace, that it is not made for\r\n    slavery. That country is destined to become great; to become one of\r\n    the most solid instruments of Providence for ruling the destinies\r\n    of humanity. That country has resources and energy sufficient to\r\n    free itself from the ruin and abasement into which the Spanish\r\n    Government has drawn it, and to claim a modest, though worthy,\r\n    place in the concert of free nations.\r\n\r\n\r\n    Given at Cavite, June 23, 1898.\r\n\r\n    _Emilio Aguinaldo_.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThese public documents were supplemented by the issue, on June 27,\r\nof \"Instructions,\" signed by Emilio Aguinaldo, which, as they relate\r\nsolely to working details of the Revolutionary Government offices,\r\nare of minor interest to the general reader.\r\n\r\nSince June 30 the rebels were in possession of Coloocan (the first,\r\nstation--beyond Manila--on the Manila-Dagupan Railway) and the Manila\r\nsuburbs of Santa Cruz and Tondo. The rebels purchased four vessels in\r\nSingapore and armed them, but, later on, Admiral Dewey forbade them to\r\nfly their flag pending the ultimate settlement of the whole Philippine\r\nproblem. They also took possession of the waterworks of Santolan\r\n(near San Juan del Monte), but did not cut off the water-supply to the\r\ncapital. Dissensions arose in the rebel camp between Emilio Aguinaldo\r\nand the leaders Yocson and Sandico. Yocson was the chief who carried\r\non the war in the northern provinces during the absence of Aguinaldo\r\nand his companions (_vide_ pp. 399, 407). The Americans had no less\r\ndifficulty in dealing with the natives than with the Spaniards. There\r\nwere frequent altercations between individual rebels and American\r\nsoldiers which, in one case at least, near Cavite, resulted very\r\nseriously. The rebels were irritated because they considered\r\nthemselves slighted, and that their importance as a factor in the\r\nhostilities was not duly recognized; in reality, there was nothing\r\nfor them to do in co-operation with the Americans, who at any time\r\ncould have brought matters to a crisis without them (by shelling the\r\ncity) but for considerations of humanity. Aguinaldo's enemies were\r\nnaturally the Spaniards, and he kept his forces actively employed in\r\nharassing them in the outlying districts; his troops had just gained\r\na great victory in Dagupan (Pangasinan), where, on July 22, the whole\r\nSpanish garrison and a number of civilian Spaniards had to capitulate\r\nin due written form. But experience had taught him that any day an\r\nattempt might be made to create a rival faction. Such a contingency\r\nhad been actually provided for in Article 29 of the Statutes of the\r\nRevolutionary Government already cited. Presumably with a view to\r\nmaintaining his prestige and keeping his individuality well before\r\nthe people, he was constantly issuing edicts and proclamations. He was\r\nwise enough to understand the proverbs, \"_L'union fait la force_,\" and\r\n\"A house divided against itself shall surely fall.\" Not the least of\r\nhis talents was that of being able to keep united a force of 30,000 to\r\n40,000 Filipinos for any object. His proclamation of the Constitution\r\nof the Revolutionary Government on June 23 implied a declaration of\r\nindependence. He really sought to draw the American authorities into\r\na recognition of it; but he did not seem to see, what others saw, the\r\ninopportunity of their doing so at that stage of America's relations\r\nwith Spain. The generals were not the arbiters of the _political_\r\nsituation. Then Aguinaldo adopted a course quite independently of\r\nthe Great Power which had undertaken the solution of the Philippine\r\nquestion, and addressed a Memorandum to the foreign Governments, with a\r\ncopy of an Act of Independence. The result was altogether negative; not\r\na single Power chose to embarrass America, at that critical period, by\r\na recognition of Aguinaldo's party. The Memorandum read as follows:--\r\n\r\n\r\n    (_Translation_)\r\n\r\n    _To the Powers_:--\r\n\r\n    The Revolutionary Government of the Philippines, on being\r\n    constituted, explained, by means of a message of the 23rd June\r\n    last, the real causes of the Philippine Revolution, and went on to\r\n    show that this popular movement is the result of those laws which\r\n    regulate the life of a nation ardently desiring progress, and\r\n    the attainment of perfection by the only possible road of liberty.\r\n\r\n    The Revolution, at the present moment, is predominant in the\r\n    provinces of Cavite, Batangas, Mindoro, Tayabas, La Laguna, Morong,\r\n    Bulacan, Bataan, Pampanga, Nueva Ecija, Tarlac, Pangasinan, La\r\n    Union, La Infanta, and Zambales, and is besieging the capital,\r\n    Manila. In these provinces the most perfect order and tranquillity\r\n    reign; they are administered by the authorities elected by\r\n    themselves in conformity with the decrees of the 18th and 23rd\r\n    of June last.\r\n\r\n    Moreover, the Revolution has about 9,000 prisoners of war, who are\r\n    treated with the same consideration observed by cultured nations,\r\n    agreeably with the sentiments of humanity, and a regular organized\r\n    army of more than 30,000 men fully equipped on a war footing.\r\n\r\n    Under these circumstances the representatives of the townships\r\n    comprised within the provinces above mentioned, interpreting the\r\n    popular will of those who have elected them, have proclaimed the\r\n    Independence of the Philippines, and requested the Revolutionary\r\n    Government to petition and solicit of the foreign Powers\r\n    an acknowledgment of their belligerency and independence,\r\n    under the conviction that the Philippine nation has arrived\r\n    at that state in which it can and ought to govern itself. As a\r\n    consequence, the annexed document has been signed by the said\r\n    representatives. Wherefore the undersigned, using the faculties\r\n    reserved to him as President of the Revolutionary Government\r\n    of the Philippines, and in the name and representation of the\r\n    Philippine nation, implores the protection of all the Powers of\r\n    the civilized world, and beseeches them formally to recognize the\r\n    belligerency, the Revolutionary Government, and the Independence of\r\n    the Philippines, because these Powers are the bulwarks designated\r\n    by Providence to maintain the equilibrium amongst nations by\r\n    sustaining the weak and _restraining the ambitions of the more\r\n    powerful_, in order that the most faultless justice may illuminate\r\n    and render effective indefinitely the progress of humanity.\r\n\r\n    Given under my hand and seal in Bacoor, in the Province of Cavite,\r\n    this 6th day of August 1898.\r\n\r\n\r\n    _Emilio Aguinaldo_,\r\n\r\n    _The President of the Revolutionary Government._\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe accompanying Act of Independence, dated August 1, 1898, and couched\r\nin the flowery language of the preceding edicts and proclamations,\r\nwas signed by those Filipinos who had been appointed local presidents\r\nof the townships in the provinces referred to. The allusion to \"the\r\nambitions of the more powerful\" could well be understood to signify\r\nan invitation to intervene in and counteract America's projects, which\r\nmight, hereafter, clash with the Aguinaldo party's aspirations. At the\r\nsame time a group of agitators, financed by the priests in and out of\r\nthe Islands, was straining every nerve to disseminate false reports\r\nand create discord between the rebels and the Americans, in the hope\r\nof frustrating their coalition. But, even then, with a hostile host\r\nbefore Manila, and the city inevitably doomed to fall, the fate of\r\nSpanish sovereignty depended more on politicians than on warriors.\r\n\r\nIn the absence of a Spanish Ambassador at Washington the French and\r\nAustro-Hungarian Governments had accepted, conjointly, the protection\r\nof Spanish subjects and interests in the United States on terms set\r\nforth in the French Ambassador's letter to the Secretary of State in\r\nWashington, dated April 22, 1898. In August the city of Santiago de\r\nCuba was beleaguered by the Americans under General Shafter; the forts\r\nhad been destroyed by Admirals Schley and Sampson; General Linares,\r\nin command there, had been wounded and placed _hors de combat_; the\r\nlarge force of Spanish troops within the walls was well armed and\r\nmunitioned, but being half-starved, the _morale_ of the rank-and-file\r\nwas at a low ebb, and General Toral, who succeeded General Linares,\r\ncapitulated. The final blow to Spanish power and hopes in Cuba was the\r\ndestruction of Admiral Cervera's fleet outside the port of Santiago de\r\nCuba. Cuba was lost to Spain. No material advantage could then possibly\r\naccrue to any of the parties by a prolongation of hostilities, and on\r\nJuly 22 the Spanish Government addressed a Message to the President\r\nof the United States (Mr. William McKinley) to inquire on what terms\r\npeace might be re-established between the two countries. In reply to\r\nthis inquiry the U.S. Secretary of State sent a despatch, dated July\r\n30, conveying an outline of the terms to be stipulated. The French\r\nAmbassador at Washington, M. Jules Cambon, having been specially\r\nappointed \"plenipotentiary to negotiate and sign,\" by decree of the\r\nQueen-Regent of Spain, dated August 11, 1898, peace negotiations were\r\nentered into, and a Protocol was signed by him and the U.S. Secretary\r\nof State, Mr. William R. Day, for their respective Governments at\r\n4.25 p.m. on August 12, 1898. It is interesting to note the exact\r\nhour and date, in view of subsequent events.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n    Protocol of Peace\r\n\r\n\r\n    _The English Text_ [200]\r\n\r\n    _Article_ 1.--Spain will relinquish all claim of sovereignty over\r\n    and title to Cuba.\r\n\r\n    _Article_ 2.--Spain will cede to the United States the Island of\r\n    Porto Rico and other islands now under Spanish sovereignty in the\r\n    West Indies, and also an island in the Ladrones to be selected\r\n    by the United States.\r\n\r\n    _Article_ 3.--_The United States will occupy and hold the city,\r\n    bay, and harbour of Manila, pending the conclusion of a treaty\r\n    of peace which shall determine the control, disposition, and\r\n    government of the Philippines_.\r\n\r\n    _Article_ 4.--Spain will immediately evacuate Cuba, Porto Rico, and\r\n    other islands now under Spanish sovereignty in the West Indies; and\r\n    to this end each Government will, within ten days after the signing\r\n    of this protocol, appoint Commissioners, and the Commissioners so\r\n    appointed shall, within 30 days after the signing of this protocol,\r\n    meet at Havana for the purpose of arranging and carrying out\r\n    the details of the aforesaid evacuation of Cuba and the adjacent\r\n    Spanish islands; and each Government will, within ten days after\r\n    the signing of this protocol, also appoint other Commissioners,\r\n    who shall, within 30 days after the signing of this protocol,\r\n    meet at San Juan, in Porto Rico, for the purpose of arranging and\r\n    carrying out the details of the aforesaid evacuation of Porto Rico\r\n    and other islands now under Spanish sovereignty in the West Indies.\r\n\r\n    _Article_ 5.--The United States and Spain will each appoint\r\n    not more than five Commissioners to treat of peace, and the\r\n    Commissioners so appointed shall meet at Paris not later than\r\n    October 1, 1898, and proceed to the negotiation and conclusion of\r\n    a treaty of peace, which treaty shall be subject to ratification\r\n    according to the respective constitutional forms of the two\r\n    countries.\r\n\r\n    _Article_ 6.--Upon the conclusion and signing of this protocol,\r\n    hostilities between the two countries shall be suspended, and\r\n    notice to that effect shall be given as soon as possible by each\r\n    Government to the commanders of its military and naval forces.\r\n\r\n    Done at Washington in duplicate, in English and in French, by\r\n    the undersigned, who have hereunto set their hands and seals,\r\n    the 12th day of August, 1898.\r\n\r\n\r\n    _William R. Day_.\r\n    _Jules Cambon_.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFor a month before the Protocol was signed the relations between\r\nSpaniards and Americans were verging towards a crisis. The respective\r\nland forces were ever on the point of precipitating the end. General\r\nF. V. Greene had his brigade encamped along the Cavite-Manila road,\r\nabout 2 1/2 miles from the Spanish fort at Malate, with outposts thrown\r\nforward to protect the camp. The rebel lines were situated nearer\r\nto Manila, between the Americans and Spaniards. On July 28 General\r\nGreene took possession of a line, from the road already occupied by\r\nhis forces, in front of the rebels' advanced position, to be ready to\r\nstart operations for the reduction of Manila. The American soldiers\r\nworked for three days at making trenches, almost unmolested by the\r\nSpaniards, who had a strong line of breastworks not more than 1,000\r\nyards in front. No Americans were killed or wounded whilst so working.\r\n\r\nOn July 31, at 11 p.m., the Spaniards opened a furious infantry\r\nand artillery fire upon the American lines and kept it up for two\r\nhours. Fort San Antonio Abad (Malate) with five guns, Blockhouse No. 14\r\nwith two guns, and connecting infantry trenches, concentrated fire\r\nupon the American breastworks, which caused considerable annoyance\r\nto the Americans. The night was pitch-dark, it rained in torrents,\r\nthere was mud and water everywhere, and the ground was too flat\r\nto drain. The 10th Pennsylvania Regiment and four guns of the Utah\r\nBatteries occupied the American line, with two batteries of the 3rd\r\nFoot Artillery in reserve. The last was brought up under a heavy fire,\r\nand taking up a position on the right, silenced the Spaniards, who\r\nwere pouring in a flanking fire. The whole camp was under arms, and\r\nammunition and reinforcements were sent. The regiments were standing\r\nexpectantly in the rain. The 1st California was ordered forward,\r\nthe bugle sounded the advance, the whole camp cheered, and the men\r\nwere delighted at the idea of meeting the enemy. Over a flat ground\r\nthe American troops advanced under a heavy Spanish fire of shell and\r\nMaueser rifles, but they were steady and checked the Spaniards' attack.\r\n\r\nGeneral Greene went forward to the trenches, firing was exchanged, and\r\nthe wounded were being brought back from the front in _carromatas_. The\r\ncontending parties were separated by bamboo thickets and swamp. The\r\nAmericans lost that night 10 killed and 30 wounded. The Spanish\r\nloss was much heavier. Most of the Americans killed were shot in the\r\nhead. The Maueser bullet has great penetrating power, but does not kill\r\nwell; in fact it often makes a small wound which hardly bleeds. As\r\npointed out at p. 369, four Maueser bullets passed right through Sancho\r\nValenzuela at his execution and left him still alive. Captain Hobbs,\r\nof the 3rd Artillery, was shot through the thigh at night, and only\r\nthe next morning saw the nature of the wound.\r\n\r\nDuring the following week the Spaniards made three more night-attacks,\r\nthe total killed and wounded Americans amounting to 10 men. The\r\nAmerican soldiers were not allowed to return the fire, unless the\r\nSpaniards were evidently about to rush the breastworks. There was\r\nsome grumbling in the camp. The Spaniards, however, got tired of\r\nfiring to so little purpose, and after the third night there was\r\nsilence. Meanwhile, in the daytime the Americans went on strengthening\r\ntheir line without being molested.\r\n\r\nOn August 7 Admiral Dewey and General Merritt sent a joint note\r\nto the Captain-General in Manila, giving him 48 hours to remove\r\nwomen and children, as, at any time after that, the city might be\r\nbombarded. The Captain-General replied thanking the Admiral and\r\nGeneral for their kind consideration, but pointed out that he had no\r\nships, and to send the women and children inland would be to place\r\nthem at the mercy of the rebels. On the expiration of the 48 hours'\r\nnotice, i.e., at noon on August 9, another joint note was addressed\r\nto General Augusti, pointing out the hopelessness of his holding out\r\nand formally demanding the surrender of the city, so that life and\r\nproperty of defenceless persons might be spared. The Captain-General\r\nreplied requesting the American commanders to apply to Madrid; but\r\nthis proposal being rejected, the correspondence ceased.\r\n\r\nOn August 11 a Council of War was held between Generals Merritt,\r\nAnderson, McArthur, and Greene, and the plan of combined attack\r\narranged between General Merritt and Admiral Dewey was explained. For\r\nsome hours a storm prevented the landing of more American troops\r\nwith supplies, but these were later on landed at Paranaque when the\r\nweather cleared up, and were hurriedly sent on to the camp, where\r\npreparations were being made for the assault on the city.\r\n\r\nWhilst the Protocol was being signed in Washington the American troops\r\nwere entrenched about 350 yards from the Spaniards, who were prepared\r\nto make their last stand at the Fort San Antonio Abad (Malate). From\r\nthe morning of that day there were apparent signs of an intended\r\nsortie by the Spaniards, and, in view of this, the rebels marched\r\ntowards the American lines, but were requested to withdraw. Indeed,\r\nthe native forces were only too anxious to co-operate with the American\r\ntroops, or at least, to have the semblance of doing so, in order to\r\njustify their claim to enter the beleaguered city as allies of the\r\ninvaders. General Merritt, however, discouraged any such alliance,\r\nand issued precise orders to his subordinate officers to avoid,\r\nas much as possible, all negotiation with the Aguinaldo party.\r\n\r\nWhy the Spaniards were still holding the city of Manila at this date\r\nis perhaps best understood by the Americans. To the casual observer\r\nit would have appeared expedient to have made the possession of\r\nManila a _fait accompli_ before the Protocol of Peace was signed. The\r\nAmericans had a large and powerful fleet in Manila Bay; they were\r\nin possession of Cavite, the arsenal and forts, and they had a large\r\narmy under Maj.-General Merritt and his staff. General Augusti was,\r\nfor weeks previous, personally disposed to surrender, and only refused\r\nto do so as a matter of form, hence the same means as were finally\r\nemployed could apparently have brought about the same result at an\r\nearlier date. [201] The only hope the Spaniards could entertain was a\r\npossible benefit to be derived from international complication. From\r\nthe tone of several of the Captain-General's despatches, published\r\nin Madrid, one may deduce that capitulation to a recognized Power\r\nwould have relieved him of the tremendous anxiety as to what would\r\nbefall the city if the rebels did enter. It is known that, before the\r\nbombardment, Admiral Dewey and his colleagues had given the humane\r\nand considerate assurance that the city should not be left to the\r\nmercy of the revolutionary forces.\r\n\r\nThe next day, Saturday, August 13, the Americans again demanded the\r\nsurrender of the city within an hour, which was refused, according\r\nto Spanish custom. Without the slenderest hope of holding the city\r\nagainst the invaders, the Spaniards preconcerted a human sacrifice,\r\n[202] under the fallacious impression that the salvation of their\r\nhonour demanded it, and operations commenced at 9.45 a.m. The ships\r\npresent at the attack were the _Olympia_ (flagship), _Monterey,\r\nRaleigh, McCulloch, Petrel, Charleston, Baltimore, Boston_, and\r\n_Concord_, with the little gunboat _Rapido_, and the captured (Spanish)\r\ngunboat _Callao_, and the armed steam-launch _Barcelo_. The _Concord_\r\nwatched the Fort Santiago at the Pasig River entrance. The American\r\ncommanders confined the bombardment to the forts and trenches situated\r\nto the south of the city. The whole of the walled city and the trading\r\nquarter of Binondo were undamaged. The fighting-line was led by the\r\n_Olympia_, which sent 4-inch shells in the direction of the fort at\r\nMalate (San Antonio de Abad). A heavy shower of rain made it difficult\r\nto get the range, and every shell fell short. The _Petrel_ then took\r\nup position and shelled the fort with varying result, followed by\r\nthe _Raleigh_. The _Rapido_ and the _Callao_, being of light draught,\r\nwere able to lie close in shore and pour in a raking fire from their\r\nsmall-calibre guns with considerable effect. The distance between the\r\nships and the fort was about 3,500 yards, and, as soon as this was\r\ncorrectly ascertained, the projectiles had a telling effect on the\r\nenemy's battery and earthworks. The _Olympia_ hurled about 70 5-inch\r\nshells and 16 8-inch shells, and the _Petrel_ and the _Raleigh_\r\nabout the same number each. There was rather a heavy wash in the\r\nbay for the little _Callao_ and the _Barcelo_, but they were all the\r\ntime capering about, pouring a hail of small shell whenever they had\r\na chance. The Spaniards at Malate returned the fire and struck the\r\n_Callao_ without doing any damage. The transport _Zafiro_ lay between\r\nthe fighting-line and the shore, having on board General Merritt, his\r\nstaff, and a volunteer regiment. The transport _Kwonghoi_ was also in\r\nreadiness with a landing-party of troops on board. In another steamer\r\nwere the correspondents of the London _Times_ and _New York Herald_,\r\nand the special artists of the _Century Magazine_ and the _Herald_. The\r\nfield artillery took no part in the operations. The shelling of the\r\nFort San Antonio Abad from the ships lasted until about 11 a.m., when\r\nthe general signal was given to cease firing. One shell, from Malate,\r\nreached the American camp. The firing from the ships had caused the\r\nSpaniards to fall back. General Greene then ordered the 1st Colorado\r\nto advance. Two companies deployed over a swamp and went along the\r\nbeach under cover of the Utah Battery. Two other companies advanced in\r\ncolumn towards the Spanish entrenchments with colours flying and bands\r\nof music playing lively tunes. The first and second companies fired\r\nvolleys to cover the advance of the other columns. They crossed the\r\nlittle creek, near Malate, in front of the fort; then, by rushes, they\r\nreached the fort, which they entered, followed by the other troops,\r\nonly to find it deserted. The Spaniards had retreated to a breastwork\r\nat the rear of the fort, where they kept up a desultory fire at the\r\nColorado troops, killing one man and wounding several. Fort San Antonio\r\nAbad was now in possession of the 1st Colorado under Lieut.-Colonel\r\nMcCoy, who climbed up the flagstaff, hauled down the Spanish flag, and\r\nhoisted the Stars and Stripes amidst cheers from the army and fleet.\r\n\r\nFour companies of the 1st Colorado advanced across the fields, entered\r\nthe Spanish trenches, crossed the bridge, and moved up the road,\r\nthe Spaniards still keeping up an ineffective fire from long range.\r\n\r\nThe 3rd Colorado came up with a band of music, and then the whole\r\nregiment deployed in skirmishing order and maintained a continual rifle\r\nfire until they halted on the Luneta Esplanade. The band took up a\r\nposition in an old Spanish trench and played as the troops filed past\r\nalong the beach. The Spaniards were gradually falling back on the city,\r\nand the rebels who were located near the Spanish lines continued the\r\nattack; but the Americans gave them the order to cease firing, which\r\nthey would not heed. The Americans thereupon turned their guns upon\r\nthe rebels, who showed an inclination to fight. Neither, however,\r\ncared to fire the first shot; so the rebels, taking another road,\r\ndrove the Spaniards, in confusion, as far as Ermita, when Emilio\r\nAguinaldo ordered his men to cease firing as they were just outside\r\nthe city walls. The rebel commander had received strict orders not\r\nto let his forces enter Manila. The American troops then developed\r\nthe attack, the Spaniards making, at first, a stubborn resistance,\r\napparently for appearance' sake, for the fight soon ended when the\r\nSpaniards in the city hoisted the white flag on a bastion of the old\r\nwalls. Orders were then given to cease firing, and by one o'clock the\r\nterms of capitulation were being negotiated. General F. V. Greene then\r\nsent an order to the troops for the rear regiments to muster on the\r\nLuneta Esplanade, and there half the American army waited in silent\r\nexpectation. The Spanish entrenchments extended out from the city\r\nwalls in different directions as far as three miles. The defenders were\r\nabout 2,500 in number, composed of Spanish regular troops, volunteers,\r\nand native auxiliaries; about the same number of troops being in the\r\nhospitals inside the city. The opponent force amounted to about 15,000\r\nrebels and 10,000 Americans ashore and afloat. The attacking guns threw\r\nheavier shot and had a longer range than the Spanish artillery. The\r\nAmericans were also better marksmen than the Spaniards. They were,\r\nmoreover, better fed and in a superior condition generally. The\r\nAmericans were buoyed up with the moral certainty of gaining an\r\neasy victory, whereas the wearied Spaniards had long ago despaired\r\nof reinforcements coming to their aid; hence their defence in this\r\nhopeless struggle was merely nominal for \"the honour of the country.\"\r\n\r\nFor some time after the white flag was hoisted there was\r\nstreet-fighting between the rebels and the loyals. The rattle\r\nof musketry was heard all round the outskirts. The rebels had\r\ntaken 300 to 400 Spanish prisoners and seized a large quantity\r\nof stores. General Basilio Augusti, who was personally averse to\r\nuseless bloodshed, relinquished his command of the Colony about a\r\nweek prior to the capitulation. Just before the attack on the city\r\nhe went on board a German steam-launch which was waiting for him\r\nand was conveyed to the German cruiser _Kaiserin Augusta_, which\r\nat once steamed out of the bay northwards. General Fermin Jaudenes\r\nremained as acting-Captain-General. [203] Brig.-General of Volunteers\r\nand Insp.-General Charles A. Whittier and Lieutenant Brumby then\r\nwent ashore in the Belgian Consul's launch, and on landing they\r\nwere met by an interpreter, Carlos Casademunt, and two officers,\r\nwho accompanied them to the house of the acting-Captain-General,\r\nwith whom the draft terms of capitulation were agreed upon. In his\r\nevidence before the Peace Commission at Paris, General Whittier said:\r\n\"I think the Captain-General was much frightened. He reported in great\r\ntrepidation that the insurgents were coming into the city, and I said\r\nthat I knew that that was impossible because such precautions had been\r\ntaken as rendered it so. \"His fear and solicitude about the natives\r\nentering the city when I received the surrender of Manila were almost\r\npainful to witness.\" Lieutenant Brumby returned to Admiral Dewey to\r\nreport, and again went ashore with General Merritt. In the meantime\r\nGeneral Jaudenes had taken refuge in the sacristy of a church which\r\nwas filled with women and children, presumably with the wise object of\r\nkeeping clear of the unrestrained mobs fighting in the suburbs. For\r\nsome time the Spanish officers refused to reveal his whereabouts,\r\nbut eventually he and General Merritt met, and on August 14 the\r\nterms of the Capitulation were signed between General Nicolas de la\r\nPena y Cuellas and Colonels Jose Maria Olaguer Tellin and Carlos Rey\r\ny Rich, as Commissioners for Spain, and Generals F. V. Greene and\r\nCharles A. Whittier, Colonel Crowder, and Captain Lamberton, U.S.N.,\r\nas Commissioners for the United States. The most important conditions\r\nembodied in the Capitulation are as follows, viz.:\r\n\r\n\r\n    1. The surrender of the Philippine Archipelago.\r\n\r\n    2. Officers to be allowed to retain their swords and personal\r\n    effects, but not their horses.\r\n\r\n    3. Officers to be prisoners of war on parole.\r\n\r\n    4. The troops to be prisoners of war and to deposit their arms\r\n    at a place to be appointed by General Merritt.\r\n\r\n    5. All necessary supplies for their maintenance to be provided\r\n    from the public Treasury funds, and after they are exhausted,\r\n    by the United States.\r\n\r\n    6. All public property to be surrendered.\r\n\r\n    7. The disposal of the troops to be negotiated, later on, by the\r\n    United States and Spanish Governments.\r\n\r\n    8. Arms to be returned to the troops at General Merritt's\r\n    discretion.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Capitulation having been signed, Lieutenant Brumby immediately went\r\nto Fort Santiago with two signalmen from the _Olympia_ and lowered\r\nthe Spanish flag, which had been flying there all day. Many Spanish\r\nofficers and a general crowd from the streets stood around, and as he\r\ndrew near to the flagstaff he was hissed by the onlookers. When the\r\norange-and-red banner was actually replaced by the Stars and Stripes,\r\nmany in the crowd shed tears. The symbol of Spanish sovereignty had\r\ndisappeared for ever. The attitude of the mob was not reassuring, so\r\nLieutenant Brumby asked an infantry officer who was present to bring\r\nhis detachment as a guard. A company of infantry happened to be coming\r\nalong, and presented arms, whilst the band, playing \"The Star-spangled\r\nBanner,\" enlivened this dramatic ceremony. Whilst this was going on the\r\nSpaniards hoisted the Spanish flag on the transport _Cebu_ and brought\r\nit down to the mouth of the Pasig River, where they set fire to it. A\r\nparty of American marines boarded her, hauled down the Spanish flag,\r\nand tried to save the hull, but it was too far consumed. The Spaniards\r\nalso destroyed barges and other Government property lying in the river.\r\n\r\nIn the official reports furnished by Generals T. M. Anderson and\r\nA. McArthur and published in America, the total casualties on the\r\nAmerican side are stated to be as follows, viz.:--On August 13, five\r\nkilled and 43 wounded. Previous to this in the trenches there were\r\n14 killed and 60 wounded, making a total of 122.\r\n\r\nThe approximate number of European Spanish troops in the Archipelago\r\nduring the year 1898 would stand thus:--\r\n\r\n\r\n    Total of troops under Gen. Primo de Rivera in\r\n    January, 1898, say                                  25,000\r\n    Shipped back to Spain by Gen. Primo de Rivera\r\n    after Aguinaldo's withdrawal to Hong-Kong\r\n    (_vide_ p. 400)                                      7,000\r\n\r\n    At the date of the Capitulation of Manila\r\n\r\n    Prisoners (regular troops) in hands of the rebels    8,000\r\n    Detachments in the Luzon Provinces (subsequently\r\n    surrendered to, or killed by, the rebels)            1,000\r\n    Killed or mortally wounded in general combat         1,000\r\n    Wounded and diseased in Manila hospitals             2,600\r\n    Approximate total in Visayas and Mindanao Island\r\n    (General Rios' jurisdiction)                         3,000\r\n    Approximate total of able-bodied troops in Manila,\r\n    prisoners of war (to America), up to December\r\n    10, 1898                                             2,400\r\n\r\n                                                        25,000\r\n\r\n\r\nGeneral F. V. Greene marched his troops down the _Calzada_ and\r\nentered the walled city, where he massed his forces. Sentinels\r\nwere placed at all the city gates; some rebels got inside the city,\r\nbut were disarmed and sent out again. At 7 p.m. the American troops\r\ntook up their quarters in public buildings, porches, and even on the\r\nstreets, for they were tired out. One might have imagined it to be a\r\ngreat British festival, for the streets were bedecked everywhere with\r\nthe British colours displayed by the Chinese who were under British\r\nprotection. That night General Merritt, General Greene and the staff\r\nofficers were served at dinner by the late Captain-General's servants\r\nin the Town Hall (_Plaza de la Catedral_), the splendid marble entrance\r\nof which became temporarily a depot for captured arms, ammunition,\r\nand accoutrements of war.\r\n\r\nNo hostile feeling was shown by Spaniards of any class. The inhabitants\r\nof the city looked remarkably well after the 105 days' siege. Trade\r\nwas absolutely at a standstill, and American troops were drafted out\r\nof the walled city to occupy the commercial quarter of Binondo on\r\nthe opposite side of the river. The government of the city was at\r\nonce taken over by Maj.-General Wesley Merritt, appointments being\r\nmade by him to the principal departments as follows, viz.:--\r\n\r\nBy General Order dated August 15, Brig.-General T. M. Anderson became\r\nCommandant of the Cavite district, the garrison of which would be\r\nincreased on the arrival of the transports on the way. Brig.-General\r\nArthur McArthur became Military Commandant of the walled city of Manila\r\nand Provost-Marshal of the city of Manila, including all the suburbs,\r\nhis barracks and staff-quarters to be within the walled city. The\r\nCommandant was to take over the offices, staff, and functions of the\r\nlate Civil Governor. Colonel Ovenshine became Deputy Provost-Marshal\r\nof the walled city south of the river; Colonel James S. Smith was\r\nappointed Deputy Provost-Marshal of Binondo and all districts situated\r\nnorth of the river.\r\n\r\nBy General Order dated August 16, Brig.-General F. V. Greene became\r\nTreasurer-General; Brig.-General of Volunteers C. A. Whittier was\r\nnominated Commissioner of Customs.\r\n\r\nBy General Order dated August 15, it was provided that within 10 days a\r\ncomplete list should be sent to Washington of all public establishments\r\nand properties of every description, including horses; that all private\r\nproperty, including horses, would be respected, and that lodging for\r\nthe prisoners of war would be provided by the Military Commandant\r\nof the city in the public buildings and barracks not required for\r\nthe American troops. Colonel C. M. C. Reeve was appointed Chief of\r\nPolice, with the 13th Regiment of Volunteer Minnesota Infantry for\r\nthis service.\r\n\r\nOn August 16 a notice was placarded outside the General Post Office\r\nto the effect that, as all the Spanish staff had refused to work for\r\nthe Americans, the local and provincial correspondence could not be\r\nattended to. This was, however, soon remedied.\r\n\r\nIn an order issued on August 22 it was enacted that all natives and\r\nall Spanish soldiers were to be disarmed before they were admitted\r\ninto the walled city. The insurgent troops were included in the above\r\ncategory, but their arms were restored to them on their leaving the\r\ncity. An exception was made in favour of the insurgent officers,\r\nfrom the grade of lieutenant upwards, who were permitted to enter\r\nand leave Manila with their swords and revolvers.\r\n\r\nOn August 25 a provisional agreement was entered into between the\r\nAmerican authorities and Emilio Aguinaldo, to remain in force pending\r\nthe result of the Paris Peace Commission, whereby their respective\r\nspheres were defined. The Americans retained jurisdiction over Manila\r\nCity, Binondo, the right bank of the Pasig River up to the Calzada\r\nde Iris and thence to Malacanan, which was included. The remaining\r\ndistricts were necessarily in the hands of the rebels, there being\r\nno recognized independent government in Luzon other than the American\r\nmilitary occupation of the capital and environs.\r\n\r\nTowards the end of August, the American Commander-in-Chief,\r\nMaj.-General Wesley Merritt, quitted the Islands in order to give\r\nevidence before the Peace Commission at Paris, after having appointed\r\nGeneral E. S. Otis to be the first Military Governor of Manila.\r\n\r\nThe British Consul, Mr. E. A. Rawson Walker, who had rendered such\r\nexcellent service to both the contending parties, died of dysentery\r\nin the month of August, and was buried at Paco cemetery.\r\n\r\nPhilippine refugees returned to the Islands in large numbers, but\r\nthe American authorities notified the Consul in Hong-Kong that only\r\nthose Chinese who could prove to his satisfaction previous residence\r\nin Manila would be allowed to return there.\r\n\r\nTrading operations were resumed immediately after the capitulation,\r\nand the first shipment of cigars made after that date was a parcel\r\nof 140,000 exported to Singapore in the first week of September\r\nand consigned to the _Tabaqueria Universal_. Business in Manila,\r\nlittle by little, resumed its usual aspect. The old Spanish newspapers\r\ncontinued to be published, and some of them, especially _El Comercio_,\r\nwere enterprising enough to print alternate columns of English and\r\nSpanish, and, occasionally, a few advertisements in very amusing\r\nbroken English. Two rebel organs, _La Independencia_ and _La Republica\r\nFilipina_, soon appeared. They were shortly followed by a number\r\nof periodicals of minor importance, such as _El Soldado Espanol, La\r\nRestauracion_ (a Carlist organ), _The Kon Leche, El Cometa_ and _El\r\nMotin_ (satirical papers) and two American papers, viz., _The Manila\r\nAmerican_ and _The Manila Times_. Liberty of the press was such a\r\nnovelty in Manila that _La Voz Espanola_ over-stepped the bounds of\r\nprudence and started a press campaign against the Americans. Delgado,\r\nthe editor, after repeated warnings from the Provost-Marshal, was at\r\nlength arrested. The paper was suppressed for abusing the Americans\r\nfrom the President downwards, and publishing matter calculated to\r\nincite the Spanish inhabitants to riot. The capital was seething\r\nwith opposition to the new conditions; many were arrested, but few\r\nlamented the incarceration, for the prison was the porch which led to\r\nfame, and through it all who were ambitious to rise from obscurity\r\nhad to pass. Moreover, imprisonment (for mere trifles) was such a\r\ncommonplace event in Spanish times that no native lost caste by the\r\nexperience of it, unless it were for a heinous crime which shocked\r\nhis fellows. Meanwhile, in the public ways and the cafes and saloons,\r\naltercations between the three parties, Spanish, native, and American,\r\nwere of frequent occurrence.\r\n\r\nFor some weeks before the capitulation there had been a certain amount\r\nof friction between the American soldiery and the rebels, who resented\r\nbeing held in check by the American authorities. Emilio Aguinaldo had\r\nhis headquarters at Bacoor, on the Cavite coast, situated between\r\ntwo divisions of the American army, one at Cavite and the other at\r\nManila, and within easy shelling distance from the American fleet. For\r\nobvious reasons he decided to remove his centre of operations,\r\nfor it was becoming doubtful how long peace between the two parties\r\nwould continue. The rebels had been sorely disappointed that they\r\nwere not allowed to enter Manila with the Americans, or even before,\r\nfor since the first few months of the rebellion they had pictured to\r\nthemselves the delights of a free raid on the city. Aguinaldo therefore\r\nremoved his headquarters to a place three miles north of Manila, but\r\nGeneral Otis requested him to go farther away from the capital. As\r\nhe hesitated to do so the General sent him an ultimatum on September\r\n13 ordering him to evacuate that place by the afternoon of the 15th,\r\nso during the night of the 14th Aguinaldo moved on with his troops to\r\nMalolos. From this town, situate about 20 miles from Manila, he could\r\nbetter unite and control the rebel factions here and there over the\r\nnorthern provinces; he could, moreover, either make use of the line\r\nof railway or cut off the connection with Manila, or he could divert\r\nsupplies from the rich rice districts and Pangasinan ports, whilst\r\nthe almost impregnable mountains were of easy access in case of need.\r\n\r\nAguinaldo declared Malolos to be the provisional capital of his\r\nRevolutionary Government, and convened a Congress to meet there on\r\nSeptember 15 in the church of Barasoain. [204] Fifty-four deputies\r\nresponded to the summons, and in conformity with Aguinaldo's\r\nproclamation of June 23 they proceeded to elect a President of\r\nCongress, Vice-President, Secretaries, etc. The result of the voting\r\nwas a remarkable event of the revolution. Don Pedro A. Paterno was\r\nelected President of Congress! The man whom the revolutionists had,\r\nless than four months before, so satirically admonished for his\r\nleaning towards Spanish sovereignty, was chosen to guide the political\r\ndestinies of this budding democracy and preside over their republican\r\nlegislative body! Deputies Benito Legarda and Ocampo were chosen\r\nto be Vice-President and Secretary respectively. Congress voted\r\nfor Aguinaldo a salary of P50,000 and P25,000 for representation\r\nexpenses. These figures were afterwards reversed, i.e., P25,000\r\nsalary, and P50,000 for expenses; but Aguinaldo, who never showed any\r\ndesire for personal gain, was quite willing to set aside the vote. A\r\ndecree in Congress, dated September 21, imposed compulsory military\r\nservice on every able-bodied Philippine male over 18 years of age,\r\nexcept those holding office under the Revolutionary Government. At\r\nan early session of Congress Deputy Tomas del Rosario made a long\r\nspeech advocating Church Disestablishment. [205]\r\n\r\nThe night before Congress met to announce the election of President,\r\netc., an attempt was made to poison Emilio Aguinaldo. Dinner was\r\nabout to be served to him; the soup was in the tureen, when one of\r\nthe three Spanish prisoners who were allowed to be about the kitchen\r\ntasted the soup in a manner to arouse suspicion. The steward at once\r\ntook a spoonful of it and fell dead on the spot. The three prisoners\r\nin question, as well as 11 Franciscan friars, were consequently placed\r\nin close confinement. At the next sitting of Congress the incident\r\nwas mentioned and it was resolved to go _en masse_ to congratulate\r\nAguinaldo on his lucky escape. At 5 p.m. the same day a _Te Deum_\r\nwas sung in Malolos Church anent this occurrence.\r\n\r\nOn October 1 the _Ratification of Philippine Independence_ was\r\nproclaimed at Malolos with imposing ceremony. From 6 a.m. the Manila\r\n(Tondo) railway-station was besieged by the crowd of sightseers on\r\ntheir way to the insurgent capital (Malolos), which was _en fete_ and\r\ngaily decorated with flags for the triumphal entry of General Emilio\r\nAguinaldo, who walked to the Congress House attired in a dress suit,\r\nwith Don Pedro A. Paterno on his right and Don Benito Legarda on his\r\nleft, followed by other representative men of the Revolutionary Party,\r\namidst the vociferous acclamations of the people and the strains of\r\nmusic. After the formal proclamation was issued the function terminated\r\nwith a banquet given to 200 insurgent notabilities. This day was\r\ndeclared by the Malolos Congress to be a public holiday in perpetuity.\r\n\r\nBy virtue of Article 3 of the Protocol of Peace the Americans were\r\nin possession of the city, bay, and harbour of Manila pending the\r\nconclusion of a treaty of peace. The terms of peace were referred to\r\na Spanish-American Commission, which met in Paris on October 1, five\r\ncommissioners and a secretary being appointed by each of the High\r\nContracting Parties. The representatives of the United States were\r\nthe Hon. William R. Day, of Ohio, ex-Secretary of State, President\r\nof the American Commission; Senator Cushman K. Davis, of Minnesota;\r\nSenator William P. Frye, of Maine; Senator George Gray, of Delaware;\r\nand the Hon. Whitelaw Reid, of New York, ex-Minister Plenipotentiary\r\nof the United States in France, assisted by the Secretary and Counsel\r\nto their Commission, Mr. John Bassett Moore, an eminent professor\r\nof international law. The Spanish Commissioners were Don Eugenio\r\nMontero Rios, Knight of the Golden Fleece, President of the Senate,\r\nex-Cabinet Minister, etc., President of the Spanish Commission;\r\nSenator Don Buenaventura Abarzuza, ex-Ambassador, ex-Minister,\r\netc.; Don Jose de Garnica y Diaz, a lawyer; Don Wenceslao Ramirez de\r\nVilla-Urrutia, Knight of the Orders of Isabella the Catholic and of\r\nCharles III., etc., Minister Plenipotentiary to the Belgian Court;\r\nand General Don Rafael Cerero y Saenz, assisted by the Secretary\r\nto their Commission, Don Emilio de Ojeda, Minister Plenipotentiary\r\nto the Court of Morocco. The conferences were held in a suite of\r\napartments at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, placed at their\r\ndisposal by M. Delcasse. Among other questions to be agreed upon\r\nand embodied in the treaty was the future of the Philippines. For\r\nWashington officials these Islands really constituted a _terra\r\nincognita_. Maj.-General Merritt and a number of other officials went\r\nto Paris to give evidence before the Commission. At their request,\r\nconveyed to me through the American Embassy, I also proceeded to\r\nParis in October and expressed my views before the Commissioners, who\r\nexamined me on the whole question. The Cuban debts and the future of\r\nthe Philippines were really the knotty points in the entire debate. The\r\nSpanish Commissioners argued (1) that the single article in the\r\nProtocol relating to the Philippines did not imply a relinquishment\r\nof Spanish sovereignty over those Islands, but only a temporary\r\noccupation of the city, bay, and harbour of Manila by the Americans\r\npending the conclusion of a treaty of peace. (2) That the attack on\r\nManila, its capitulation, and all acts of force consequent thereon,\r\ncommitted _after_ the Protocol was signed, were unlawful because the\r\nProtocol stipulated an immediate cessation of hostilities; therefore\r\nthe Commissioners claimed indemnity for those acts, a restoration\r\nto the _status quo ante_, and \"the immediate delivery of the place\r\n(Manila) to the Spanish Government\" (_vide_ Annex to Protocol No. 12\r\nof the Paris Peace Commission conference of November 3).\r\n\r\nThe American Commissioners replied: (1) \"It is the contention on the\r\npart of the United States that this article leaves to the determination\r\nof the treaty of peace the entire subject of the future government and\r\nsovereignty of the Philippines necessarily embodied in the terms used\r\nin the Protocol.\" (2) It is erroneous to suggest \"that the ultimate\r\ndemands of the United States in respect of the Philippines were\r\nembodied in the Protocol.\" (3) That there was no cable communication\r\nwith Manila, hence the American commanders could not possibly have been\r\ninformed of the terms of the Protocol on the day of its signature. The\r\nSpanish Commissioners, nevertheless, tenaciously persisting in their\r\ncontention, brought matters to the verge of a resumption of hostilities\r\nwhen the American Commissioners presented what was practically an\r\nultimatum, in which they claimed an absolute cession of the Islands,\r\noffering, however, to pay to Spain $20,000,000 gold, to agree, for a\r\nterm of years, to admit Spanish ships and merchandise into the Islands\r\non the same terms as American ships and merchandise, and to mutually\r\nwaive all claims for indemnity--(_vide_ Annex to Protocol No. 15 of\r\nthe Paris Peace Commission conference of November 21).\r\n\r\nFor a few days the Spaniards still held out, and to appease public\r\nfeeling in the Peninsula a fleet under Admiral Camara was despatched,\r\nostensibly to the Philippines. It was probably never intended that\r\nthe fleet should go beyond Port Said, for on its arrival there it was\r\nordered to return, the official explanation to the indignant Spanish\r\npublic being that America was preparing to seize the Archipelago by\r\nforce, if necessary, and send a fleet to Spanish waters under the\r\ncommand of Admiral Watson. Sagasta's Government had not the least\r\nintention of letting matters go so far as that, but it suited the\r\nSpanish Cabinet, already extremely unpopular, to make an appearance of\r\nresistance. Moreover, Senor Sagasta had personal motives for wishing\r\nto protract the negotiations, the examination of which would lead\r\none too far away from the present subject into Spanish politics.\r\n\r\nAt the next conference of the Commission the demands of the Americans\r\nwere reluctantly conceded, and the form in which the treaty was to\r\nbe drafted was finally settled. The sitting of the Commission was\r\nterminated by the reading of a strongly-worded protest by Senor\r\nMontero Rios in which the Spanish Commissioner declared that they\r\nhad been compelled to yield to brute force and abuse of international\r\nlaw against which they vehemently protested. The secretaries of the\r\nrespective Commissions were then instructed to draw up the document of\r\nthe Treaty of Peace, which was signed at 9 p.m. on Saturday, December\r\n10, 1898, in the Grand Gallery of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs in\r\nParis. The expenses of the Spanish Commission amounted to L8,400. A\r\ndelay of six months was agreed upon for the ratification by the two\r\nGovernments of the treaty, the text of which is given at the end of\r\nthis chapter. America undertook to establish equal duties on Spanish\r\nand American goods for a period of ten years; but it subsequently\r\ntranspired that this was no special boon to Spain, seeing that America\r\ndeclared shortly after the signing of the treaty that there would be\r\nno preferential tariff, and that merchandise of all nations could\r\nenter the Islands at the same rate of duty and on equal terms with\r\nAmerica. The clauses of the treaty relating to the Philippines met\r\nwith determined opposition in the United States, where politicians\r\nwere divided into three parties advocating respectively annexation,\r\nprotection, and abandonment of the Islands to the natives.\r\n\r\nAt the closing conferences of the Commission several additional\r\nclauses to the treaty were proposed by the one party and the other and\r\nrejected. Among the most singular are the following:--The Spaniards\r\nproposed that America should pay annually to the descendants of\r\nChristopher Columbus $7,400 to be charged to the treasuries of Porto\r\nRico and Manila. The Americans proposed that Spain should concede\r\nto them the right to land telegraph-cables in the Canary Islands,\r\nor on any territory owned by Spain on the coast of Africa, or in\r\nthe Peninsula, in consideration of a cash payment of one million\r\ngold dollars.\r\n\r\nWe must now go back to September to follow the thread of events\r\nwhich intervened from that period and during the 71 days' sitting of\r\nthe Peace Commission in Paris. My old acquaintance Felipe Agoncillo\r\nwas sent to Washington in September by Emilio Aguinaldo to solicit\r\npermission from the American Government to represent the rebels'\r\ncause on the Paris Commission, or, failing this, to be allowed to\r\nstate their case. The Government, however, refused to recognize\r\nhim officially, so he proceeded to Paris. Having unsuccessfully\r\nendeavoured to be heard before the Commission, he drew up a protest in\r\nduplicate, handing a copy to the Spanish and another to the American\r\nCommissioners. The purport of this document was that whereas the\r\nAmericans had supplied the Filipinos with war-material and arms to gain\r\ntheir independence and not to fight against Spain in the interests\r\nof America, and whereas America now insisted on claiming possession\r\nof the Archipelago, he protested, in the name of Emilio Aguinaldo,\r\nagainst what he considered a defraudment of his just rights. His\r\nmission led to nothing, so he returned to Washington to watch events\r\nfor Aguinaldo. After the treaty was signed in Paris he was received\r\nat the White House, where an opportunity was afforded him of stating\r\nthe Filipinos' views; but he did not take full advantage of it, and\r\nreturned to Paris, where I met him in July, 1900, holding the position\r\nof \"High Commissioner for the Philippine Republic.\" His policy was,\r\nthen, \"absolute independence, free of all foreign control.\" In 1904\r\nwe met again in Hong-Kong, where he was established as a lawyer.\r\n\r\nIn this interval, too, matters in Manila remained _in statu quo_\r\nso far as the American occupation was concerned. General E. S. Otis\r\nwas still in supreme command in succession to General Merritt,\r\nand reinforcements were arriving from America to strengthen the\r\nposition. General Otis's able administration wrought a wonderful change\r\nin the city. The weary, forlorn look of those who had great interests\r\nat stake gradually wore off; business was as brisk as in the old times,\r\nand the Custom-house was being worked with a promptitude hitherto\r\nunknown in the Islands. There were no more sleepless nights, fearing\r\nan attack from the dreaded rebel or the volunteer. The large majority\r\nof foreign (including Spanish) and half-caste Manila merchants showed\r\na higher appreciation of American protection than of the prospect\r\nof sovereign independence under a Philippine Republic. On the other\r\nhand, the drunken brawls of the American soldiers in the cafes,\r\ndrinking-shops, and the open streets constituted a novelty in the\r\nColony. Drinking \"saloons\" and bars monopolized quite a fifth of\r\nthe stores in the principal shopping street, _La Escolta_, where\r\nsuch unruliness obtained, to the detriment of American prestige,\r\nthat happily the Government decided to exclude those establishments\r\naltogether from that important thoroughfare, which has since entirely\r\nregained its respectable reputation. The innovation was all the more\r\nunfortunate because of the extremely bad impression it made on the\r\nnatives and Spaniards, who are remarkably abstemious. It must also\r\nhave been the cause of a large percentage of the sickness of the\r\nAmerican troops (wrongly attributed to climate), for it is well known\r\nthat inebriety in the Philippines is the road to death. With three\r\ndistinct classes of soldiers in Manila--the Americans, the rebels,\r\nand the Spanish prisoners--each living in suspense, awaiting events\r\nwith divergent interests, there were naturally frequent disputes\r\nand collisions, sometimes of a serious nature, which needed great\r\nvigilance to suppress.\r\n\r\nThe German trading community observed that, due to the strange conduct\r\nof the commanders of the German fleet, who showed such partiality\r\ntowards the Spaniards up to the capitulation of Manila, the natives\r\ntreated them with marked reticence. The Germans therefore addressed\r\na more than ample letter of apology on the subject to the newspaper\r\n_La Independencia_ (October 17).\r\n\r\nAs revolutionary steamers were again cruising in Philippine waters,\r\nall vessels formerly flying the Spanish flag were hastily placed on the\r\nAmerican register to secure the protection of the Stars and Stripes,\r\nand ex-Consul Oscar F. Williams was deputed to attend to these and\r\nother matters connected with the shipping trade of the port.\r\n\r\nIt was yet theoretically possible that the Archipelago might revert\r\nto Spain; hence pending the deliberations of the Peace Commission,\r\nno movement was made on the part of the Americans to overthrow\r\nthe _de facto_ Spanish Government still subsisting in the southern\r\nislands. General Fermin Jaudenes, the vanquished Commander-in-Chief\r\nof the Spanish forces in Manila (Sub-Inspector until General Augusti\r\nleft), was liberated on parole in the capital until the first week\r\nof October, when the American Government allowed him to return\r\nto Spain. He left in the s.s. _Esmeralda_ for Hong-Kong on October\r\n15. Meanwhile, a month before, the Spanish Government appointed General\r\nDiego de los Rios Gov.-General of the Philippines, with residence at\r\nYloilo. Spaniards of all classes were at least personally safe in\r\nManila under American protection. All who could reach the capital\r\ndid so, for Spanish sway in the provinces was practically at an\r\nend. Aguinaldo therefore directed his attention both to matters of\r\ngovernment in Luzon and to the control of the southern islands.\r\n\r\nNeither the Filipinos nor the Spaniards could foresee that the\r\nevacuation by the Spaniards of _all_ the Islands would be insisted upon\r\nby the American Commissioners in Paris. Moreover, it was no easy task\r\nfor Aguinaldo to maintain his own personal prestige (an indispensable\r\ncondition in all revolutions), carry out his own plans of government,\r\nand keep together, in inactivity, a large half-disciplined fighting\r\nforce. Three weeks after the capitulation of Manila, Aguinaldo sent\r\nseveral small vessels to the Island of Panay, carrying Luzon rebels to\r\neffect a landing and stir up rebellion in Visayas. He was anxious to\r\nsecure all the territory he could before the conditions of peace should\r\nbe settled in Paris, in the hope that actual possession would influence\r\nthe final issue. General Rios was therefore compelled to enter on a\r\nnew campaign, assisted by the small gunboats which had remained south\r\nsince hostilities commenced north in May. Spanish troops were sent\r\nto Singapore _en route_for Yloilo, and then a question arose between\r\nMadrid and Washington as to whether they could be allowed to proceed\r\nto their destination under the peace Protocol. The Tagalog rebels\r\nlanded in the province of Antique (Panay Is.), and a few natives of the\r\nlocality joined them. They were shortly met by the Spanish troops, and\r\nsevere fighting took place in the neighbourhood of Bugason, where the\r\nrebels were ultimately routed with great loss of men and impedimenta.\r\n\r\nThe survivors fled to their vessels and landed elsewhere on the same\r\ncoast. In several places on the Island the flag of rebellion had been\r\nunfurled, and General Rios' troops showed them no quarter. At the\r\nend of six weeks the rebels had been beaten in numerous encounters,\r\nwithout the least apparent chance of gaining their objective point--the\r\nseizure of Yloilo. In the Concepcion district (East Panay) the rebel\r\nchief Perfecto Poblado took the command, but gained no victory with\r\nhis following of 4,000 men. So far, what was happening in the Islands,\r\nother than Luzon, did not officially concern the Americans.\r\n\r\nAbout this time, in Manila, there was by no means that _entente\r\ncordiale_ which should have existed between the rebels and the\r\nAmericans, supposing them to be real allies. In reality, it was only in\r\nthe minds of the insurgents that there existed an alliance, which the\r\nAmericans could not, with good grace, have frankly repudiated, seeing\r\nthat General T. M. Anderson was frequently soliciting Aguinaldo's\r\nassistance and co-operation. [206] Aguinaldo was naturally uneasy about\r\nthe possible prospect of a protracted struggle with the Spaniards,\r\nif the Islands should revert to them; he was none the less irritated\r\nbecause his repeated edicts and proclamations of independence received\r\nno recognition from the Americans. General Anderson had already stated,\r\nin his reply (July 22) to a letter from Aguinaldo, that he had no\r\nauthority to recognize Aguinaldo's assumption of dictatorship. The\r\nnative swaggering soldiery, with the air of conquerors, were ever\r\nready to rush to arms on the most trivial pretext, and became a\r\ngrowing menace to the peaceful inhabitants. Therefore, on October 25,\r\nAguinaldo was again ordered to withdraw his troops still farther,\r\nto distances varying from five to eight miles off Manila, and he\r\nreluctantly complied. When this order was sent to him his forces\r\nin the neighbourhood of Manila were estimated to be as follows:--At\r\nColoocan, 3,000 men, with two guns trained on Binondo; Santa Mesa,\r\n380; Pasig, 400; Paco, Santa Ana, Pandacan, and Pasay, 400 to 500\r\neach; south of Malate, 1,200, and at Santolan waterworks (on which\r\nthe supply of potable water to the capital depended), 380.\r\n\r\nIn Panay Island General Rios published an edict offering considerable\r\nreforms, but the flame of rebellion was too widespread for it to\r\nhave any effect. The Island of Cebu also was in revolt; the harsh\r\nmeasures of General Montero effected nothing to Spain's advantage,\r\nwhilst that miserable system of treating suspects as proved culprits\r\ncreated rebels. Neither did the _Moro_ raid on the Cebuanos, referred\r\nto at p. 406, serve to break their spirit; more than half the villages\r\ndefied Spanish authority, refused to pay taxes, and forced the friars\r\nto take refuge in Cebu City, which was, so far, safe. Those who were\r\nable took passage to ports outside the Archipelago. In Leyte Island\r\nthere were risings of minor importance, instigated by Tagalogs, and\r\nchiefly directed against the friars, who were everywhere obnoxious\r\nto the people. At Catbalogan (Samar Is.) an armed mob attacked the\r\nSpaniards, who fled to the house of an American. General Rios had not\r\nsufficient troops to dominate several islands covering such a large\r\narea. He was so hard pressed in Panay alone that, even if he had had\r\nample means of transport, he could neither divide his forces nor afford\r\nto spend time in carrying them from one island to another. Towards\r\nthe end of October he ran short of ammunition, but, opportunely,\r\nthe Spanish mail-steamer _Buenos Aires_ brought him a supply with\r\nwhich he could continue the struggle. Fresh Tagalog expeditions were\r\nmeanwhile sent south, and coerced or persuaded the Panay people to\r\nrise in greater force than ever, until, finally, General Rios had to\r\nfall back on Yloilo. By the middle of November practically the whole\r\nisland, except the towns of Yloilo, Molo, Jaro and La Paz, was under\r\nrebel dominion. In December General Rios held only the town and port\r\nof Yloilo. He had ordered the bridge of Manduriao to be destroyed, so\r\nas to establish a dividing line between him and the rebels who were\r\nentrenched on the opposite bank of the river, neither party being\r\nwilling to make a bold onslaught on the other, although frequent\r\nskirmishing took place. On receipt of the news of the conclusion of\r\nthe Treaty of Paris, General Rios proposed to the rebels a mutual\r\ncessation of hostilities, on the ground that no advantage could\r\naccrue to either party by a further sacrifice of blood and munitions\r\nof war, seeing that within a few days he was going to evacuate the\r\ntown and embark his troops, and that, so far as he was concerned,\r\nthey could then take his place without opposition. But the rebels,\r\npresumably interpreting his humane suggestion as a sign of weakness,\r\ncontinued to fire on the Spanish troops.\r\n\r\nThe small detachments and garrisons in Negros Island had been unable\r\nto resist the tide of revolt; the west coast of that island was\r\nover-run by the rebels under the leadership of Aniceto Lacson and\r\nJuan Araneta (a much respected planter of Bago, personally known to\r\nme), and the local Spanish Governor, Don Isidro Castro, was forced to\r\ncapitulate, in due written form, at Bacolod, on November 6, with his\r\ntroops and all the Spanish civil and military employees. By December\r\n1 it was evident that, although Spanish empire in Visayas had been\r\ndefinitely broken, there was absolute discord among the (southern)\r\nrebels themselves. They split up into rival factions, each one wanting\r\nto set up a government of its own. The American Peace Commissioners\r\nhad made their formal demand for the cession of all the Islands,\r\nand it was clear to the Spanish Government that General Rios would\r\nsooner or later have to evacuate under the treaty. It was useless,\r\ntherefore, to continue to shed European blood and waste treasure in\r\nthose regions. In the first week of December the Madrid Government\r\nordered General Rios to suspend hostilities and retire to Mindanao\r\nIsland with his troops, pending arrangements for their return to\r\nthe Peninsula. General Rios replied to this order, saying that he\r\nwould make the necessary preparations. Meanwhile, on December 11,\r\nthe rebels approached the fortifications around Yloilo town, and the\r\nSpaniards kept up an almost continuous fusillade. Before daybreak on\r\nDecember 14 the rebels, armed with bowie-knives, attacked the Spanish\r\nentrenchments in great force and drove the Spaniards back from their\r\nfirst to their second redoubt. The Spaniards rallied, turned their four\r\nfield-pieces on the enemy, and opened a raking artillery and rifle fire\r\nwhich mowed down the rebels, who retired in great disorder, leaving\r\nabout 500 dead and wounded. The Spaniards, who were well protected\r\nbehind their stockades, had 6 dead and 17 wounded. Notwithstanding\r\ntheir severe repulse, the rebels again fired on the Spaniards until\r\nsome female relations of their General Araneta and others went out to\r\nthe rebel lines and harangued and expostulated with the leaders, and\r\nso put them to shame with their tongues that thenceforth the rebels\r\nceased to molest the Spaniards. General Rios then took measures for\r\nevacution. On December 23, 1898, he formally handed over Yloilo to the\r\nmayor of the town in the presence of his staff, the naval commanders,\r\nand the foreign consuls, and requested the German Vice-Consul to look\r\nafter Spanish interests. On the following day the Spanish troops,\r\nnumbering between five and six hundred, and several civilians were\r\nembarked in perfect order, without any unfortunate incident occurring,\r\non board the s.s. _Isla de Luzon,_ which sailed for Zamboanga, the\r\nrallying-place of the Spaniards, whilst some small steamers went to\r\nother places to bring the officials to the same centre.\r\n\r\nBefore leaving Yloilo, after many tedious delays respecting the\r\nconditions, an exchange of prisoners was effected with the rebels,\r\nwho at the outset were inclined to be unduly exacting.\r\n\r\nThe rebels at once took possession of Yloilo, but a controlling\r\nAmerican force arrived in the roadstead on December 27, under the\r\ncommand of General Miller, and was afterwards reinforced up to a\r\ntotal strength of about 3,000 troops.\r\n\r\nThe Caroline Islands (which were not ceded under the Treaty of\r\nParis) were provisioned for three months, and the Spanish troops in\r\nCebu Island and Yligan (Mindanao Is.) had been already ordered to\r\nconcentrate and prepare for embarkation on the same day for Zamboanga\r\n(Mindanao Is.), where the bulk of them remained until they could be\r\nbrought back to Spain on the terms of the treaty of peace. In a few\r\ndays General Rios left Zamboanga in the s.s. _Leon XIII._ for Manila,\r\nand remained there until June 3, 1899, to endeavour to negotiate\r\nthe liberation of the Spanish prisoners detained by Aguinaldo. They\r\nwere kept under guard in the mountain districts, far away from the\r\ncapital, in groups miles distant from each other. No one outside\r\nthe rebel camp could ever ascertain the exact number of prisoners,\r\nwhich was kept secret. The strenuous efforts made by the Spaniards\r\nto secure their release are fully referred to in Chap. xxvi.\r\n\r\nDuring this period of evacuation the natives in Balabac Island\r\nassassinated all the male Europeans resident there, the Spanish\r\nGovernor, a lieutenant, and a doctor being among the victims. The\r\nEuropean women were held in captivity for awhile, notwithstanding\r\nthe peaceful endeavours to obtain their release, supported by the\r\nDatto Harun Narrasid, Sultan of Paragua and ex-Sultan of Sulu (_vide_\r\np. 142). The place was then attacked by an armed force, without result,\r\nbut eventually the natives allowed the women to be taken away.\r\n\r\nSome of the Spanish soldiers and the civil servants concentrated in\r\nZamboanga were carried direct to the Peninsula, _via_ the Straits\r\nof Balabac, in the steamers _Buenos Aires, Isla de Luzon_, and\r\n_Cachemir_, and from Manila many of them returned to their country in\r\nthe s.s. _Leon XIII_. In conformity with the Treaty of Paris (Art. 5),\r\nlittle by little all the Spanish troops, temporarily prisoners of\r\nthe United States in Manila, were repatriated.\r\n\r\nThe Philippine Republican Congress at Malolos had now (December 26,\r\n1898) adjourned in great confusion. The deputies could not agree upon\r\nthe terms of a Republican Constitution. They were already divided\r\ninto two distinct parties, the Pacificos and the Irreconcilables. The\r\nlatter were headed by a certain Apolinario Mabini (_vide_ p. 546),\r\na lawyer hitherto unknown, and a notorious opponent of Aguinaldo\r\nuntil he decided to take the field against the Americans. The Cabinet\r\nhaving resigned, Aguinaldo prudently left Malolos on a visit to Pedro\r\nA. Paterno, at Santa Ana, on the Pasig River.\r\n\r\nAt the end of the year 1898, after 327 years of sovereignty, all that\r\nremained to Spain of her once splendid Far Eastern colonial possessions\r\nwere the Caroline, the Pelew, and the Ladrone Islands (_vide_ p. 39),\r\nminus the Island of Guam. Under the treaty of peace, signed in Paris,\r\nthe Americans became nominal owners of the evacuated territories,\r\nbut they were only in real possession, by force of arms, of Cavite\r\nand Manila. The rest of the Archipelago, excepting Mindanao and the\r\nSulu Sultanate, was virtually and forcibly held by the natives in\r\nrevolt. At the close of 1898 the Americans and the rebels had become\r\nrival parties, and the differences between them foreboded either\r\nfrightful bloodshed or the humiliation of the one or the other.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n    Treaty of Peace\r\n\r\n    concluded between the United States of America and Spain, signed\r\n    in Paris on December 10, 1898, and ratified in Washington on\r\n    February 6, 1899. The original documents (in duplicate) are drawn\r\n    up in Spanish and in English respectively.\r\n\r\n    _The English Text_} [207]\r\n\r\n    _Article_ 1.--Spain relinquishes all claim of sovereignty over\r\n    and title to Cuba.

The arms of the soldiers in question shall\r\n    be restored to them.\r\n\r\n    Spain will, upon the exchange of the ratification of the present\r\n    treaty, proceed to evacuate the Philippines, as well as the\r\n    Island of Guam, on terms similiar to those agreed upon by the\r\n    Commissioners appointed to arrange for the evacuation of Porto\r\n    Rico and other islands in the West Indies, under the Protocol of\r\n    August 12, 1898, which is to continue in force till its provisions\r\n    are completely executed.\r\n\r\n    The time within which the evacuation of the Philippine\r\n    Islands and Guam shall be completed shall be fixed by the two\r\n    Governments. Stands of colours, uncaptured war-vessels, small arms,\r\n    guns of all calibres, with their carriages and accessories, powder,\r\n    ammunition, live-stock, and materials and supplies of all kinds,\r\n    belonging to the land and naval forces of Spain in the Philippines\r\n    and Guam, remain the property of Spain. Pieces of heavy ordnance,\r\n    exclusive of field artillery, in the fortifications and coast\r\n    defences, shall remain in their emplacements for the term of six\r\n    months, to be reckoned from the exchange of ratifications of the\r\n    treaty; and the United States may, in the meantime, purchase such\r\n    material from Spain, if a satisfactory agreement between the two\r\n    Governments on the subject shall be reached.\r\n\r\n    _Article_ 6.--Spain will, upon the signature of the present\r\n    treaty, release all prisoners of war, and all persons detained\r\n    or imprisoned for political offences in connection with the\r\n    insurrections in Cuba and the Philippines and the war with the\r\n    United States.\r\n\r\n    Reciprocally, the United States will release all persons made\r\n    prisoners of war by the American forces, and will undertake to\r\n    obtain the release of all Spanish prisoners in the hands of the\r\n    insurgents in Cuba and the Philippines.\r\n\r\n    The Government of the United States will at its own cost return to\r\n    Spain and the Government of Spain will at its own cost return to\r\n    the United States, Cuba, Porto Rico, and the Philippines, according\r\n    to the situation of their respective homes, prisoners released\r\n    or caused to be released by them, respectively, under this article.\r\n\r\n    _Article_ 7.--The United States and Spain mutually relinquish all\r\n    claims for indemnity, national and individual, of every kind,\r\n    of either Government, or of its citizens or subjects, against\r\n    the other Government, that may have arisen since the beginning\r\n    of the late insurrection in Cuba and prior to the exchange of\r\n    ratifications of the present treaty, including all claims for\r\n    indemnity for the cost of the war.\r\n\r\n    The United States will adjudicate and settle the claims of its\r\n    citizens against Spain relinquished in this article.\r\n\r\n    _Article_ 8.--In conformity with the provisions of Articles 1,\r\n    2 and 3 of this treaty, Spain relinquishes in Cuba, and cedes in\r\n    Porto Rico and other islands in the West Indies, in the Island\r\n    of Guam, and in the Philippine Archipelago, all the buildings,\r\n    wharves, barracks, forts, structures, public highways and other\r\n    immovable property which, in conformity with law, belong to the\r\n    public domain, and as such belong to the Crown of Spain.\r\n\r\n    And it is hereby declared that the relinquishment or cession,\r\n    as the case may be, to which the preceding paragraph refers,\r\n    cannot in any respect impair the property or rights which by\r\n    law belong to the peaceful possession of property of all kinds,\r\n    of provinces, municipalities, public or private establishments,\r\n    ecclesiastical or civic bodies, or any other associations having\r\n    legal capacity to acquire and possess property in the aforesaid\r\n    territories renounced or ceded, or of private individuals, of\r\n    whatsoever nationality such individuals may be.\r\n\r\n    The aforesaid relinquishment or cession, as the case may be,\r\n    includes all documents exclusively referring to the sovereignty\r\n    relinquished or ceded that may exist in the archives of the\r\n    Peninsula. Where any document in such archives only in part relates\r\n    to said sovereignty, a copy of such part will be furnished whenever\r\n    it shall be requested. Like rules shall be reciprocally observed\r\n    in favour of Spain in respect of documents in the archives of\r\n    the islands above referred to.\r\n\r\n    In the aforesaid relinquishment or cession, as the case may be,\r\n    are also included such rights as the Crown of Spain and its\r\n    authorities possess in respect of the official archives and\r\n    records, executive as well as judicial, in the islands above\r\n    referred to, which relate to the said islands or the rights and\r\n    property of their inhabitants. Such archives and records shall be\r\n    carefully preserved, and private persons shall without distinction\r\n    have the right to require, in accordance with law, authenticated\r\n    copies of the contracts, wills and other instruments forming part\r\n    of notarial protocols or files, or which may be contained in the\r\n    executive or judicial archives, be the latter in Spain or in the\r\n    islands aforesaid.\r\n\r\n    _Article_ 9.--Spanish subjects, natives of the Peninsula,\r\n    residing in the territory over which Spain by the present\r\n    treaty relinquishes or cedes her sovereignty, may remain in such\r\n    territory, or may remove therefrom, retaining in either event all\r\n    their rights of property, including the right to sell or dispose\r\n    of such property or of its proceeds; and they shall also have\r\n    the right to carry on their industry, commerce and professions,\r\n    being subject in respect thereof to such laws as are applicable to\r\n    other foreigners. In case they remain in the territory they may\r\n    preserve their allegiance to the Crown of Spain by making before\r\n    a court of record, within a year from the date of the exchange\r\n    of ratifications of this treaty, a declaration of their decision\r\n    to preserve such allegiance; in default of which declaration\r\n    they shall be held to have renounced it and to have adopted the\r\n    nationality of the territory in which they may reside.\r\n\r\n    The civil rights and political status of the native inhabitants\r\n    of the territories hereby ceded to the United States shall be\r\n    determined by the Congress.\r\n\r\n    _Article_ 10.--The inhabitants of the territories over which\r\n    Spain relinquishes or cedes her sovereignty shall be secured in\r\n    the free exercise of their religion.\r\n\r\n    _Article_ 11.--The Spaniards residing in the territories over\r\n    which Spain by this treaty cedes or relinquishes her sovereignty\r\n    shall be subject in matters civil as well as criminal to the\r\n    jurisdiction of the courts of the country wherein they reside,\r\n    pursuant to the ordinary laws governing the same; and they shall\r\n    have the right to appear before such courts, and to pursue the\r\n    same course as citizens of the country to which the courts belong.\r\n\r\n    _Article_ 12.--Judicial proceedings pending at the time of the\r\n    exchange of ratifications of this treaty in the territories\r\n    over which Spain relinquishes or cedes her sovereignty shall\r\n    be determined according to the following rules: (1) Judgements\r\n    rendered either in civil suits between private individuals, or in\r\n    criminal matters, before the date mentioned, and with respect to\r\n    which there is no recourse, or right of review under the Spanish\r\n    law, shall be deemed to be final, and shall be executed in due\r\n    form by competent authority in the territory within which such\r\n    judgements shall be carried out: (2) Civil suits between private\r\n    individuals which may on the date mentioned be undetermined shall\r\n    be prosecuted to judgement before the court in which they may\r\n    then be pending or in the court that may be substituted therefor:\r\n    (3) Criminal actions pending on the date mentioned before the\r\n    Supreme Court of Spain, against citizens of the territory which\r\n    by this treaty ceases to be Spanish, shall continue under its\r\n    jurisdiction until final judgement; but, such judgement having\r\n    been rendered, the execution thereof shall be committed to the\r\n    competent authority of the place in which the case arose.\r\n\r\n    _Article_ 13.--The rights of property secured by copyrights and\r\n    patents acquired by Spaniards in the Island of Cuba and in Porto\r\n    Rico, the Philippines and other ceded territories, at the time of\r\n    the exchange of the ratifications of this treaty, shall continue\r\n    to be respected. Spanish scientific, literary and artistic works,\r\n    not subversive of public order in the territories in question,\r\n    shall continue to be admitted free of duty into such territories,\r\n    for the period of ten years, to be reckoned from the date of the\r\n    exchange of the ratifications of this treaty.\r\n\r\n    _Article_ 14.--Spain will have the power to establish Consular\r\n    officers in the ports and places of the territories, the\r\n    sovereignty over which has been either relinquished or ceded by\r\n    the present treaty.\r\n\r\n    _Article_ 15.--The Government of each country will, for the term\r\n    of ten years, accord to the merchant vessels of the other country\r\n    the same treatment in respect of all port charges, including\r\n    entrance and clearance dues, light dues, and tonnage duties,\r\n    as it accords to its own merchant vessels, not engaged in the\r\n    coastwise trade. This article may at any time be terminated on\r\n    six months' notice given by either Government to the other.\r\n\r\n    _Article_ 16.--It is understood that any obligations assumed\r\n    in this treaty by the United States with respect to Cuba are\r\n    limited to the time of its occupancy thereof; but it will,\r\n    upon the termination of such occupancy, advise any Government\r\n    established in the Island to assume the same obligations.\r\n\r\n    _Article_ 17.--The present treaty shall be ratified by the\r\n    President of the United States, by and with the advice and consent\r\n    of the Senate thereof, and by Her Majesty the Queen-Regent of\r\n    Spain; and the ratifications shall be exchanged at Washington\r\n    within six months from the date hereof, or earlier if possible.\r\n\r\n    In faith whereof, we, the respective Plenipotentiaries, have\r\n    signed this treaty and have hereunto affixed our seals.\r\n\r\n    Done in duplicate at Paris, the 10th day of December, in the year\r\n    of our Lord 1898.\r\n\r\n        _William R.

These small islands had, apparently, been overlooked\r\nwhen the Treaty of Paris was concluded.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXIV\r\n\r\nAn Outline of the War of Independence, Period 1899-1901\r\n\r\n\r\n\"I speak not of forcible annexation because that is not to be\r\nthought of, and under our code of morality that would be criminal\r\naggression.\"--_President McKinley's Message to Congress_; _December_,\r\n1897.\r\n\r\n\"The Philippines are ours as much as Louisiana by purchase, or Texas\r\nor Alaska.\"--_President McKinley's Speech to the 10th Pennsylvania\r\nRegiment; August_ 28, 1899.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Ignorance_ of the world's ways, beyond the Philippine shores,\r\nwas the cause of the Aguinaldo party's first disappointment. A\r\nscore of pamphlets has been published to show how thoroughly the\r\nFilipinos believed America's mission to these Islands to be solely\r\nprompted by a compassionate desire to aid them in their struggle\r\nfor immediate sovereign independence. Laudatory and congratulatory\r\nspeeches, uttered in British colonies, in the presence of American\r\nofficials, and hope-inspiring expressions which fell from their lips\r\nbefore Aguinaldo's return to Cavite from exile, strengthened that\r\nconviction. Sympathetic avowals and grandiloquent phrases, such as\r\n\"for the sake of humanity,\" and \"the cause of civilization,\" which were\r\nso freely bandied about at the time by unauthorized Americans, drew\r\nAguinaldo into the error of believing that some sort of bond really\r\nexisted between the United States and the Philippine Revolutionary\r\nParty. In truth, there was no agreement between America and the\r\nFilipinos. There was no American plenipotentiary empowered to make\r\nany political compact with the Islanders. At that date there was\r\nneither a Philippine policy nor any fixed programme regarding the\r\nfuture disposal of the Islands, and whatever naval, military, or other\r\nofficers might have said to Aguinaldo was said on their own private\r\nresponsibility, and could in no way affect the action of the American\r\nGovernment. Without any training in or natural bent for diplomacy,\r\nAguinaldo had not the faintest idea of what foreign \"protection\"\r\nsignified. He thought that after the capture of Manila the Americans\r\nwould sail away and leave the Filipinos to themselves, and only\r\nreappear if any other Power interfered with their native government.\r\n\r\nAdmiral Dewey had a double task to perform. He had to destroy the\r\nSpanish fleet, and to co-operate in the taking of Manila. In the\r\ndestruction of the fleet the attitude of the natives was of little\r\nconcern to him. In the taking of the capital it was important to know\r\nwhat part the natives would play. It was certain they would not be\r\nplacid spectators of the struggle, wherever Aguinaldo might be. If\r\nthey _must_ enter into it, it was desirable to have them led by one who\r\ncould control them and repress excesses. It would have been better for\r\nthe Americans if, pending the issue with the Spaniards, no third party\r\nhad existed; but, as it did exist, both contending nations were anxious\r\nfor its goodwill or its control. Therefore Admiral Dewey's recognition\r\nof Aguinaldo as a factor in the hostilities was nothing more nor\r\nless than a legitimate stratagem to facilitate his operations against\r\nthe Spaniards. Dewey simply neutralized a possible adverse force by\r\nadmissible military artifice, and Aguinaldo was too ingenuous to see\r\nthat he was being outwitted. The fighting section of the Filipinos\r\nwas intensely irritated at not having been allowed to enter and sack\r\nthe capital. They had looked forward to it as the crowning act of\r\nvictory. The general mass of the christianized Islanders hoped that\r\nPhilippine independence would immediately follow the capitulation\r\nof Manila, although, in the capital itself, natives of position\r\nand property evinced little enthusiasm for the insurgents' triumph,\r\nwhilst some inwardly doubted it. In September a native lawyer, Felipe\r\nAgoncillo, was sent to Washington to lay the Filipinos' case before the\r\nPresident in the hope of gaining his personal support of their claims\r\n(_vide_ p. 472). The first fear was that the Colony might revert to\r\nSpain, but that idea was soon dispelled by the news of the stipulations\r\nof the Treaty of Paris. Simultaneously Aguinaldo's revolutionary army\r\nwas being pushed farther and farther away from the capital, and it\r\nwas evident, from the mood of his fighting-men, that if the Americans\r\nremained in possession of the Colony, hostilities, sooner or later,\r\nmust break out. The Americans officially ignored the Aguinaldo party as\r\na factor in public affairs, but they were not unaware of the warlike\r\npreparations being made. Secret anti-American meetings were held at\r\nplaces called clubs, where it was agreed to attack simultaneously\r\nthe Americans inside and outside the capital. General Pio del Pilar\r\nslept in the city every night, ready to give the rocket-signal for\r\nrevolt. Natives between 18 and 40 years of age were being recruited\r\nfor military service, according to a Malolos Government decree\r\ndated September 21, 1898. In every smithy and factory bowie-knives\r\nwere being forged with all speed, and 10,000 men were already armed\r\nwith them. General E. S. Otis was willing to confer with Aguinaldo,\r\nand six sessions were held, the last taking place on January 29, six\r\ndays before the outbreak. Nothing resulted from these conferences, the\r\nAmericans alleging that Aguinaldo would make no definite statement of\r\nhis people's aims, whilst the Filipinos declare that their intentions\r\nwere so well understood by the American general that he would listen\r\nto nothing short of unconditional submission.\r\n\r\nThe following manifesto, dated January 5, signed by Emilio Aguinaldo,\r\nclearly shows the attitude of the Revolutionary Party at this period:--\r\n\r\n\r\n    _To My Brethren the Filipinos, and to All the Respected Consuls\r\n    and Other Foreigners_:--\r\n\r\n    General Otis styles himself Military Governor of these Islands,\r\n    and I protest one and a thousand times and with all the energy of\r\n    my soul against such authority. I proclaim solemnly that I have\r\n    not recognized either in Singapore or in Hong-Kong or in the\r\n    Philippines, by word or in writing, the sovereignty of America\r\n    over this beloved soil. On the contrary, I say that I returned to\r\n    these Islands on an American warship on the 19th of May last for\r\n    the express purpose of making war on the Spaniards to regain our\r\n    liberty and independence. I stated this in my proclamation of the\r\n    24th of May last, and I published it in my Manifesto addressed to\r\n    the Philippine people on the 12th of June. Lastly, all this was\r\n    confirmed by the American General Merritt himself, predecessor\r\n    of General Otis, in his Manifesto to the Philippine people some\r\n    days before he demanded the surrender of Manila from the Spanish\r\n    General Jaudenes. In that Manifesto it is distinctly stated that\r\n    the naval and field forces of the United States had come to give\r\n    us our liberty, by subverting the bad Spanish Government. And I\r\n    hereby protest against this unexpected act of the United States\r\n    claiming sovereignty over these Islands. My relations with the\r\n    American authorities prove undeniably that the United States did\r\n    not bring me over here from Hong-Kong to make war on the Spaniards\r\n    for their benefit, but for the purpose of our own liberty and\r\n    independence. . . .\r\n\r\n    _Emilio Aguinaldo_.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAguinaldo having been successively Dictator and President of the\r\nRevolutionary Government (_vide_ p. 448), now assumed the new title of\r\nPresident of the _Philippine Republic_, the Articles of Constitution\r\nof which (drawn up by his Prime Minister Apolinario Mabini) were\r\ndated January 21, 1899, and promulgated by him on the following\r\nday. In due course the news came that the date of voting in the\r\nSenate for or against the retention of the Islands was fixed. The\r\nAmericans already in the Colony were practically unanimous in their\r\ndesire for its retention, and every effort was made by them to that\r\nend. The question of the treaty ratification was warmly discussed\r\nin Washington. A week before the vote was taken it was doubtful\r\nwhether the necessary two-thirds majority could be obtained. It was\r\na remarkable coincidence that just when the Republican Party was\r\nstraining every nerve to secure the two or three wavering votes, the\r\nfirst shots were exchanged between a native and an American outpost\r\nin the suburbs of the capital. Each side accuses the other of having\r\nprecipitated hostilities. However that may be, this event took place\r\nprecisely at a date when the news of it in Washington served to secure\r\nthe votes of the hesitating senators in favour of retention. [208]\r\nThe provocative demeanour of the insurgents at the outposts was\r\nsuch that a rupture was inevitable sooner or later, and if a Senate\r\nvote of abandonment had come simultaneously with insurrection, the\r\nsituation would have been extremely complicated; it would have been\r\ndifficult for the Oriental not to have believed that the invader\r\nwas nervously beating a retreat. The Nebraska Regiment was at Santa\r\nMesa, guarding its front. Americans were frequently insulted, called\r\ncowards, and openly menaced by the insurgents. In the evening of\r\nSaturday, February 4, 1899, an insurgent officer came with a detail\r\nof men and attempted to force his way past the sentinel on the San\r\nJuan bridge. About nine o'clock a large body of rebels advanced on\r\nthe South Dakota Regiment's outposts, and to avoid the necessity\r\nof firing, for obvious reasons, the picquets fell back. For several\r\nnights a certain insurgent lieutenant had tried to pass the Nebraska\r\nlines. At length he approached a sentinel, who called \"halt\" three\r\ntimes without response, and then shot the lieutenant dead. Several\r\ninsurgents then fired and retreated; rockets were at once sent up by\r\nthe Filipinos, and firing started all along the line, from Caloocan\r\nto Santa Mesa. By ten o'clock the Filipinos concentrated at Caloocan,\r\nSanta Mesa, and Gagalanging, whence they opened a simultaneous, but\r\nineffectual, fusillade, supplemented by two siege guns at Balichalic\r\nand a skirmishing attack from Pandacan and Paco. Desperate fighting\r\ncontinued throughout the night; the Filipinos, driven back from every\r\npost with heavy loss, rallied the next morning at Paco, where they\r\noccupied the parish church, to which many non-combatant refugees\r\nhad fled. The American warships, co-operating with their batteries,\r\npoured a terrific fire on the church, and kept up a continuous attack\r\non the insurgent position at Caloocan, where General Aguinaldo was in\r\ncommand. At daylight the Americans made a general advance towards Paco\r\nand Santa Ana. At the former place the Filipinos resisted desperately;\r\nthe church, sheltering refugees and insurgents, was completely\r\ndemolished; [209] the Filipinos' loss amounted to about 4,000 killed\r\nand wounded, whilst the Americans lost about 175 killed and wounded. It\r\nis estimated that the approximate number of troops engaged in this\r\nencounter was 13,000 Americans and 20,000 Filipinos. The insurgents\r\nat Santa Ana, the survivors of the Paco defeat, and the force which\r\nhad to abandon the Santolan water-works, where they left behind them\r\na howitzer, all concentrated at Caloocan. The insurgent and American\r\nlines formed a semicircle some 15 miles in extent, making it impossible\r\nto give a comprehensive description of the numerous small engagements.\r\n\r\nImmediately the news of the rupture reached Washington the Philippine\r\nEnvoy, Felipe Agoncillo, fled to Montreal, Canada, in a great\r\nhurry, leaving his luggage behind. No one was troubling him, and\r\nthere was not the least need for such a precipitate flight from a\r\ncountry where civilized international usages obtain. On February 5\r\nan engagement took place at Gagalanging, where the natives collected\r\nin the hundreds of bungalows around that village awaiting the advance\r\nof the Oregon Regiment. Amongst the spectators was the German Prince\r\nLudwig von Loewenstein. The Americans continued advancing and firing,\r\nwhen suddenly the prince ran across an open space and took shelter in\r\na hut which he must have known would be attacked by the Oregons. The\r\norder was given to fire into the native dwellings giving cover to\r\nthe insurgents, and the prince's dead body was subsequently found\r\nperforated by a bullet. In his pocket he carried a pass issued by\r\nAguinaldo conceding to the bearer permission to go anywhere within\r\nthe insurgent lines, and stating that he was a sympathizer with their\r\ncause. It was noticed that the prince several times deliberately threw\r\nhimself into danger. No one could ascertain exactly in what capacity\r\nhe found himself near the fighting-line. Less than two years previously\r\nhe had married the daughter of an English earl, and the popular belief\r\nwas that, for private reasons, he intentionally courted death.\r\n\r\nThe rebels were repulsed at every point with great loss. Lines of smoke\r\nfrom the burning villages marked the direction taken by the Americans\r\nadvancing under the leadership of Generals Otis, Wheaton, Hale,\r\nand Hall. An immense amount of impedimenta in the shape of pontoons,\r\ntelegraph posts and wires, ammunition, and provisions followed the\r\ninfantry in perfect order. On the line taken by the troops many\r\nnative householders hoisted white flags to indicate their peaceful\r\nintentions. Ambulances were frequently seen coming in with the wounded\r\nAmericans and Filipinos, and among them was brought the chief of an\r\nIgorrote tribe with a broken thigh. His tribe, who had been persuaded\r\nby Aguinaldo to bring their bows and arrows to co-operate with him,\r\nwere placed in the front and suffered great slaughter. In hospital\r\nthe Igorrote chief spoke with much bitterness of how he had been\r\ndeceived, and vowed vengeance against the Tagalogs. The next day\r\nat Caloocan the rebels made a determined stand, but were driven out\r\nof the place by 10-inch shells fired from the _Monadnock_ over the\r\nAmerican lines. General Hall occupied Santolan and the pumping-station\r\nthere and repelled the repeated attacks made on his column. General\r\nMcArthur with a flying column cleared the surrounding district of the\r\nenemy, but owing to the roughness of the country he was unable to\r\npursue them. Aguinaldo was therefore able to escape north with his\r\narmy, reinforced by native troops who had been trained in Spanish\r\nservice. There was also a concentration of about 2,500 natives from\r\nthe southern Luzon provinces. The insurgents had cut trenches at\r\nalmost every mile along the route north. In the several skirmishes\r\nwhich took place on March 25 the Americans lost one captain and 25 men\r\nkilled and eight officers and 142 men wounded. The next day there was\r\nsome hard fighting around Polo and Novaliches, where the insurgents\r\nheld out for six hours against General McArthur's three brigades of\r\ncavalry and artillery. After the defeat at Paco, Aguinaldo moved\r\non to the town of Malabon, which was shelled; the enemy therefore\r\nimmediately evacuated that place in great confusion, after setting\r\nfire to the buildings. Over 1,000 men, women, and children hastened\r\nacross the low, swampy lands carrying their household goods and their\r\nfighting-cocks; it was indeed a curious spectacle. General Wheaton's\r\nbrigade captured Malinta, and the insurgents fled panic-stricken after\r\nhaving suffered severely. The American loss was small in numbers,\r\nbut Colonel Egbert, of the 22nd Infantry, was mortally wounded whilst\r\nleading a charge. As he lay on the litter in the midst of the fight\r\nGeneral Wheaton cheered him with the words, \"Nobly done, Egbert!\" to\r\nwhich the dying colonel replied, \"Good-bye, General; I'm done; I'm\r\ntoo old,\" and at once expired.\r\n\r\nIn March the natives tried to burn down one of the busiest Manila\r\nsuburbs. At 8 o'clock one evening they set fire to the Chinese\r\nquarters in Santa Cruz, and the breeze rapidly wafted the flames. The\r\nconflagration lasted four hours. The English Fire-Brigade turned out\r\nto quench it. Hundreds of Chinese laden with chattels hurried to and\r\nfro about the streets; natives rushed hither and thither frantically\r\ntrying to keep the fire going whilst the whites were endeavouring\r\nto extinguish it; and with the confusion of European and Oriental\r\ntongues the place was a perfect pandemonium. General Hughes was\r\nat the head of the police, but the surging mob pressed forward and\r\ncut the hose five times. With fixed bayonets the troops partially\r\nsucceeded in holding back the swelling crowd. The electric wires got\r\nout of working order, and the city was lighted only by the glare of\r\nthe flaming buildings. Bullets were flying in all directions about\r\nTondo and Binondo. The intense excitement was intentionally sustained\r\nby batches of natives who rushed hither and thither with hideous\r\nyells to inspire a feeling of terror. Many families, fearing that the\r\ninsurgents had broken through the American lines and entered the city\r\n_en masse_, frantically fled from the hotels and houses. Incessant\r\nbugle-calls from the natives added to the commotion, and thousands\r\nof Chinese crowded into the Chinese Consulate. Finally the rioters\r\nwere driven back, and a cordon of troops assured the safety of the\r\ncapital. Sharp engagements simultaneously took place at the Chinese\r\ncemetery and at San Pedro Macati. Bands of insurgents were arrested\r\nin Tondo. A group of 60 was captured escorting two cartloads of arms\r\nand ammunition to a house. Business was almost entirely suspended,\r\nand a general order was issued by the Military Governor commanding\r\nall civilians to remain in their houses after 7 p.m. This hour was\r\ngradually extended to 8 o'clock, then 9 o'clock, and finally to\r\nmidnight, as circumstances permitted. An edict was posted up fixing\r\nthe penalties for incendiarism. During two days smoke hovered around\r\nthe neighbourhood, and the appearance of Manila from the bay was that\r\nof a smouldering city.\r\n\r\nIn the fighting up country, one of the greatest difficulties for the\r\nAmericans was that the insurgents would not concentrate and have a\r\ndecisive contest. They would fire a few volleys from cover and retreat\r\nto other cover, repeating these harassing, but inconclusive, tactics\r\nover many miles of ground. On their march the Americans had to fight\r\na hidden foe who slipped from trench to trench, or found safety in\r\nthe woods. Sometimes a trenchful of the enemy would fire a volley and\r\nhalf of them disappear through gullies leading to other cover. The\r\nnext point of importance to be reached was Malalos, and on the way\r\nsome thirty villages had to be passed. Besides the volleys delivered\r\nby hidden insurgents all along the line, a hard-fought battle took\r\nplace on March 28 under the personal direction of General Aguinaldo,\r\nwho concentrated about 5,000 men near Marilao. Aguinaldo directed\r\nthe movements without appearing on the field; indeed it is doubtful\r\nwhether, during this war, he ever led his troops into action. General\r\nMcArthur's division had halted at Meycauayan the previous night,\r\nand in the morning advanced north in conjunction with General Hale's\r\nbrigade, which took the right, whilst General Otis led his troops\r\nto the left of the railroad, General Wheaton's brigade being held in\r\nreserve. After a three-mile march these forces fell in with the enemy,\r\nwho opened fire from trenches and thickets; but General Otis's troops\r\ncharged them gallantly and drove them back across the river. There the\r\ninsurgents rallied, relying upon the splendid trenches which they had\r\ndug. The battle raged for three hours, the combatants being finally\r\nwithin fifty yards of each other. Eventually the American artillery\r\ncame into play, when the advanced works of the insurgent defences were\r\nliterally pulverized and the general rout of the enemy began. They\r\nretreated to their second stronghold of bamboo thickets, pursued by the\r\n1st South Dakota Infantry, which made a brilliant charge in the open,\r\nunder a galling fire, with a loss of three lieutenants and seven men\r\nkilled on the field and about a score wounded. The insurgents, however,\r\nwere completely defeated and scattered, leaving 85 dead counted in\r\nthe trenches and thickets, and a hundred prisoners in the hands of\r\nthe Americans. Before abandoning Marilao the insurgents burnt the town\r\nto the ground and continued their hurried flight to Malolos. They had\r\nplenty of time to rally, for the Americans found great difficulty in\r\nbringing their artillery across the river at Guiguinto. It had to be\r\ndrawn over the railway bridge by hand whilst the mules swam across\r\nto the northern bank, all being, at the same time, under a desultory\r\nfire from the enemy. The resistance of the Filipinos to the passage of\r\nthe river at Guiguinto was so stubborn that the Americans lost about\r\n70 killed and wounded. At 6 a.m. the Americans started the advance\r\ntowards Malolos in the same order taken for the march to Marilao,\r\nGeneral Hale's brigade taking the right and General Otis's the left\r\nof the railroad. Several skirmishes took place on the way and General\r\nWheaton brought his reserves forward into the general advance. At\r\nBocaue the river presented the same difficulties for artillery\r\ntransport as were experienced at Guiguinto, except that the enemy was\r\nnowhere to be seen. Bigaa was reached and not an armed native was in\r\nsight, all having apparently concentrated in the insurgent capital,\r\nMalolos. The American casualties that day, due solely to the morning\r\nskirmishes, amounted to four killed and thirty wounded.\r\n\r\nIt is apparent, from the official despatches, that at this time\r\nthe American generals seriously believed the Aguinaldo party would\r\nacknowledge its defeat and make peace if Malolos, the revolutionary\r\nseat of government, fell. All that was going on in Manila was well\r\nknown to the insurgents in the field, as the news was brought to\r\nthem daily by runners who were able to enter the city during daylight\r\nwithout interference. On March 30 General McArthur's division resumed\r\nthe advance and brought up the baggage trains, after having repaired\r\nthe several bridges damaged by the enemy. The environs of Malolos were\r\nreconnoitred up to within a mile of the town, and the dead bodies\r\nof insurgent soldiers were seen scattered here and there. Groups of\r\nhundreds of non-combatants were hurrying off from the beleaguered\r\ninsurgent capital. General Otis's brigade pushed forward without\r\nany encounter with the enemy, but General Hale's column, which\r\ncontinued to take the right side of the railway, was fired upon\r\nfrom the woods, the total casualties that day being five killed and\r\n43 wounded. At 7 a.m. (March 31) the Americans opened the combined\r\nattack on Malolos. General McArthur directed the operations from\r\nthe railway embankment, and half an hour's artillery fire dislodged\r\nthe enemy from their cover. The columns advanced cautiously towards\r\nthe town in anticipation of a fierce resistance and, it was hoped,\r\na fight to the finish. General Otis marched on direct: General Hale\r\nexecuted a flanking movement to the east; General Wheaton's brigades\r\nwere held in reserve, and a halt of half an hour was made preparatory\r\nto the final assault. The scouts then returned and reported that the\r\ninsurgents had abandoned their capital! It was a disappointment to\r\nthe Americans who had looked forward to inflicting a decisive and\r\ncrushing defeat on the enemy. The first troops to enter the town\r\nwere the 20th Kansas Regiment, under Colonel Funston. The natives,\r\nin the wildest confusion, scampered off, after firing a few parting\r\nshots at the approaching forces, and the Americans, with a total\r\nloss of 15 killed and wounded, were in undisputed possession of the\r\ninsurgent capital. Aguinaldo had prudently evacuated it two days\r\nbefore with his main army, going in the direction of Calumpit. Only\r\none battalion had been left behind to burn the town on the approach\r\nof the Americans. Aguinaldo's headquarters, the parish church,\r\nand a few hundred yards of railway were already destroyed when\r\nthe Americans occupied the place, still partly in flames. Some\r\nfew hundreds of Chinese were the only inhabitants remaining in\r\nMalolos. The value of the food-stuffs captured in this place was\r\nestimated at P1,500,000. Simultaneously, General Hall's brigade\r\noperated five to seven miles north of Manila and drove the insurgents\r\nout of Mariquina, San Mateo, and the environs of the Montalban River\r\nwith a loss of 20 men wounded and Lieutenant Gregg killed. It was now\r\nevident that Aguinaldo had no intention to come to close quarters and\r\nbring matters to a crisis by pitched battles. His policy was apparently\r\nto harry the Americans by keeping them constantly on the move against\r\nguerilla parties, in the hope that a long and wearisome campaign would\r\nend in the Americans abandoning the Islands in disgust, leaving the\r\nFilipinos to their own desired independence. Aguinaldo had moved on\r\nto Calumpit with his main army with the intention of establishing\r\nhis Government there. On the American side, active preparations were\r\nmade to dislodge him. Small gunboats were fitted out for operating\r\non the Rio Grande de Pampanga, and an armoured train was prepared for\r\nuse farther north. From Paranaque, on the bay shore south of Manila,\r\nthe insurgents fired on the monitor _Monadnock_, but a few shots from\r\nthis vessel silenced the shore battery. In several places, within 10\r\nto 15 miles of the capital, armed groups of insurgents concentrated,\r\nbut Aguinaldo moved on towards Baliuag, in the province of Bulacan,\r\nso as to be within easy reach of the hill district of Angat in case\r\nof defeat.\r\n\r\nA few days after the capture of Malolos, General Otis issued a\r\nproclamation to the Filipinos, in the hope that by drawing off public\r\nsympathy from the insurgent cause it would dwindle away. The terms\r\nof this document were as follows, viz.:--\r\n\r\n\r\n    (1) The supremacy of the United States must and will be enforced\r\n    throughout every part of the Archipelago. Those who resist can\r\n    accomplish nothing except their own ruin.\r\n\r\n    (2) The most ample liberty of self-government will be granted\r\n    which is reconcilable with the maintenance of a wise, just,\r\n    stable, effective, and economical administration, and compatible\r\n    with the sovereign and international rights and obligations of\r\n    the United States.\r\n\r\n    (3) The civil rights of the Filipinos will be guaranteed and\r\n    protected, religious freedom will be assured, and all will have\r\n    equal standing before the law.\r\n\r\n    (4) Honour, justice, and friendship forbid the exploitation of\r\n    the people of the Islands. The purpose of the American Government\r\n    is the welfare and advancement of the Filipino people.\r\n\r\n    (5) The American Government guarantees an honest and effective\r\n    civil service, in which, to the fullest extent practicable,\r\n    natives shall be employed.\r\n\r\n    (6) The collection and application of taxes and revenues will be\r\n    put on a sound and honest economical basis. Public funds will be\r\n    raised justly and collected honestly, and will be applied only in\r\n    defraying the proper expenses of the establishment and maintenance\r\n    of the Philippine Government, and such general improvements as\r\n    public interests demand. Local funds collected for local purposes\r\n    shall not be diverted to other ends. With such a prudent and\r\n    honest fiscal administration it is believed that the needs of\r\n    the Government will, in a short time, become compatible with a\r\n    considerable reduction of taxation.\r\n\r\n    (7) The pure, speedy, and effective administration of justice,\r\n    whereby the evils of delay, corruption, and exploitation will be\r\n    effectually eradicated.\r\n\r\n    (8) The construction of roads, railways, and other means of\r\n    communication and transportation, and other public works of\r\n    manifest advantage to the people will be promoted.\r\n\r\n    (9) Domestic and foreign trade, commerce, agriculture, and other\r\n    industrial pursuits, and the general development of the country\r\n    and interest of the inhabitants will be the constant objects of\r\n    the solicitude and fostering care of the Government.\r\n\r\n    (10) Effective provision will be made for the establishment of\r\n    elementary schools, in which the children of the people shall be\r\n    educated, and appropriate facilities will also be provided for\r\n    their higher education.\r\n\r\n    (11) Reforms in all departments of the Government, all branches\r\n    of the public service, and all corporations closely touching the\r\n    common life of the people must be undertaken without delay, and\r\n    effected conformably with right and justice in such a way as to\r\n    satisfy the well-founded demands and the highest sentiments and\r\n    aspirations of the Philippine people.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe above proclamation, no doubt, embodies the programme of what\r\nthe American Government desired to carry out at the time of its\r\npublication.\r\n\r\nThe Americans resumed the aggressive against the insurgents, and\r\nan expedition of 1,509 men and two mountain-guns was fitted out\r\nunder the command of General Lawton to proceed up the Pasig River\r\ninto the Lake of Bay in order to capture Santa Cruz at the eastern\r\nextremity. The expedition presented a curious sight; it comprised 15\r\nnative barges or \"cascoes\" towed by seven tugs. Some of the craft\r\nran aground at Napindan, the entrance to the lake, and delayed the\r\nlittle flotilla until daylight. The barges ahead had to wait for the\r\nvessels lagging behind. Then a mist came over the shore, and there was\r\nanother halt. A couple of miles off an insurgent steamer was sighted,\r\nbut it passed on. Finally Santa Cruz was reached; 200 sharpshooters\r\nwere landed under cover of the launch guns, and fighting continued\r\nall the afternoon until nightfall. Early in the morning the town was\r\nattacked, the church situated in the centre was captured, and the\r\nAmerican loss was only six men wounded; the insurgents were driven\r\nfar away, leaving 68 dead on the field, and a large number of wounded,\r\nwhilst hundreds were taken prisoners.\r\n\r\nOn April 12, at the request of the Spanish General Rios, [210] the\r\ngunboat _Yorktown_ was despatched to Baler, on the east coast of Luzon,\r\nto endeavour to rescue a party of 80 Spanish soldiers, three officers,\r\nand two priests who were holding out against 400 insurgents. These\r\nnatives, who were all armed with Maueser rifles, laid in ambush,\r\nand surprised the landing-party under Lieutenant Gilmore. The whole\r\nparty was captured by the insurgents, who were afterwards ordered to\r\nrelease them all. General Aguinaldo was always as humanely disposed\r\nas the circumstances of war would permit, and, at the request of the\r\ncommissioners for the liberation of the Spanish prisoners, he gave\r\nthis little band of 83 heroes and two priests their liberty under\r\na decree so characteristic of Philippine imitative genius in its\r\npompous allusion to the Spanish glorious past that it is well worth\r\nrecording. [211]\r\n\r\nGeneral Lawton asserted that 100,000 men would be required to conquer\r\nthe Philippines, but they were never sent, because there was always\r\nan influential group of optimists who expected an early collapse\r\nof the insurgent movement. General Otis sent frequent cablegrams to\r\nWashington expressing his belief that the war would soon come to an\r\nend. However, in April, 1899, 14,000 regular troops were despatched\r\nto the Islands to reinforce the Volunteer regiments. It was a wise\r\nmeasure taken not too soon, for it was clear that a certain amount\r\nof discontent had manifested itself among the Volunteers. Moreover,\r\nthe whole management of the Philippine problem was much hampered by\r\nan anti-annexation movement in America which did not fail to have its\r\ninfluence on the Volunteers, many of whom were anxious to return home\r\nif they could. Senator Hoar and his partisans persistently opposed the\r\nretention of the Islands, claiming that it was contrary to the spirit\r\nof the American Constitution to impose a government upon a people\r\nagainst its will. American sentiment was indeed becoming more and more\r\nopposed to expansion of territorial possession beyond the continent,\r\nin view of the unsatisfactory operations in the Philippines--a feeling\r\nwhich was, however, greatly counterbalanced by a recognition of the\r\npolitical necessity of finishing an unpleasant task already begun,\r\nfor the sake of national dignity.\r\n\r\nAbout this time the Philippine envoy, Felipe Agoncillo, was in Paris\r\nas president of a _junta_ of his compatriots. Some of the members\r\nwere of opinion that they ought to negotiate for peace directly with\r\nthe American Secretary of State, but Agoncillo so tenaciously opposed\r\nanything short of sovereign Philippine independence that some of the\r\nmembers withdrew and returned to the Islands. A year later I found\r\nAgoncillo of exactly the same intransigent persuasion.\r\n\r\nAt the end of April the Americans suffered a severe reverse at Guingua\r\n(Bulacan), where Major Bell, with 40 cavalrymen, came across a strong\r\noutpost from which the enemy fired, killing one and wounding five\r\nmen. With great difficulty the dead and wounded were carried back under\r\nfire, and it was found that the enemy occupied a big trench encircling\r\nthree sides of a paddy-field bordering on a wood. As the Americans\r\nretreated, the insurgents crept up, aided by a mist, to within short\r\nrange and fired another volley. Major Bell sent for reinforcements,\r\nand a battalion of infantry was soon on the scene, but their advance\r\nwas checked by the continuous firing from the trenches. Artillery\r\nwas on the way, but the insurgents were not disposed to charge\r\nthe Americans, who lay for two hours under cover of a rice-field\r\nembankment in a broiling hot sun. One man died of sunstroke. Finally\r\na second battalion of infantry arrived under the command of Colonel\r\nStotsenberg, who was very popular with his men. He was received with\r\ncheers, and immediately ordered a charge against the enemy in the\r\ntrenches; but whilst leading the attack he was shot in the breast,\r\nand died immediately. Within short range of the trenches Lieutenant\r\nSisson fell, shot through the heart. By this time the artillery had\r\narrived, and shelled the trenches. The insurgents, however, held their\r\nposition well for a time, until the infantry was close up to them,\r\nwhen, following their usual tactics, they ran off to another trench a\r\nmile or so away. The total American losses that day were two officers\r\nand four privates killed, and three officers and 40 men wounded.\r\n\r\nSpanish prisoners released by the Filipinos declared that the\r\ninsurgents had 50,000 rifles and 200 pieces of artillery captured\r\nfrom the Spaniards, ample ammunition manufactured at two large\r\nfactories up country, and occasional fresh supplies of war-material\r\nshipped from China by Chinese, European, and American merchants. The\r\npreparations made to dislodge Aguinaldo and his main army, entrenched\r\nand sheltered by fortifications at Calumpit, were now completed,\r\nand General McArthur's division steadily advanced. The flower of the\r\ninsurgent army was there, well armed and supplied with artillery\r\nand shrapnel shell. Commanded by General Antonio Luna, they were\r\nevidently prepared to make at Calumpit the bold stand which was\r\nexpected of them at Malolos. The transport difficulties were very\r\ngreat, and as General McArthur approached, every foot of ground was\r\ndisputed by the enemy. Bridges had been broken down, and the guns had\r\nto be hauled through jungle and woods under a scorching sun. Many\r\nbuffaloes succumbed to the fatigue, and hundreds of Chinamen were\r\nemployed to do their work. The Bagbag River was reached, but it had\r\nto be crossed, and the passage cost the Americans six men killed and\r\n28 wounded. The Bagbag River was well fortified, and the Americans\r\nhad to attack its defenders from an open space. There were trenches\r\nat every approach; enormous pieces of rock had been dislodged and\r\nhauled down towards the breastworks of the trenches to form cover. The\r\narmoured train, pushed along the railway by Chinamen, then came into\r\naction, and its quick-firing guns opened the assault on the enemy's\r\nposition. Six-pounders were also brought into play; the insurgents were\r\ngradually receding; artillery was wheeled up to the river bank and a\r\nregular bombardment of the bridge ensued. The trenches were shelled,\r\nand the insurgents were firing their guns in the direction of the\r\narmoured train, but they failed to get the range. Meantime, a company\r\nof the Kansas Regiment made a bold charge across a paddy-field and\r\nfound shelter in a ditch, whence they kept up a constant fire to divert\r\nthe enemy's attention whilst Colonel Eunston, the commander of the\r\nregiment, with a lieutenant and four men, crept along the girders of\r\nthe bridge. The enemy, however, got the range and bullets were flying\r\nall around them, so they slid down the bridge-supports, dropped into\r\nthe river, and swam to the opposite shore. Scrambling up the bank,\r\nrevolvers in hand, they reached the trenches just as the insurgents\r\nwere hurriedly evacuating them. Indeed, the Filipinos' defence of their\r\ntrenches was extremely feeble during the whole battle. On the other\r\nhand, for the first time, the insurgents ventured out into the open\r\nagainst the Americans. General Antonio Luna, the Commander-in-Chief,\r\ncould be seen galloping furiously along the lines exhorting his men to\r\nhold their ground, and he succeeded in deploying them into an extended\r\nline of battle to receive the enemy's onslaught. The insurgents kept\r\nup a desultory fire whilst the troops forded the river, and then they\r\nwere pursued and driven off to the outskirts of the town. The flames\r\nrising from several buildings appeared to indicate an intention on the\r\npart of the insurgents to abandon their stronghold. Simultaneously,\r\nGenerals Hale and Wheaton were coming forward with their columns,\r\neach having had some hard fighting on the way. The junction of forces\r\nwas effected; a fierce fire was poured into the trenches; General Hale\r\nand his men made a dash across a stream, up to their waists in water;\r\nthe Utah men followed with their batteries, cheering and dragging\r\ntheir field-pieces with desperate energy to the opposite bank; the\r\nenemy gave way, and the armoured train crossed the bridge. The total\r\nAmerican loss that day did not exceed nine in killed and wounded,\r\nwhilst the insurgent losses were at least 70. During the night the\r\nengineers repaired the Bagbag bridge for the rest of the troops to\r\npass, and fighting was resumed at six o'clock in the morning. The\r\ndeserted trenches were occupied by the Americans to pick off any\r\ninsurgents who might venture out into the open. A general assault by\r\nthe combined columns was then made on the town, which was captured,\r\nwhilst the bulk of the insurgents fled in great confusion towards the\r\nhills. The few who lingered in the trenches in the northern suburbs\r\nof the town were shelled out of them by the American artillery placed\r\nnear the church, and the survivors decamped, hotly pursued for some\r\ndistance by cavalry. So great was the slaughter that the insurgents'\r\ntotal losses are unknown. The trenches were choked with dead bodies,\r\nand piles of them were found in many places. When nightfall came\r\nand the Americans were resting in Calumpit after their two days'\r\nhard fighting, the whole district was illuminated for miles around\r\nby the flames from the burning villages and groups of huts, whilst\r\nthe snapping of the burning bamboos echoed through the stillness like\r\nvolleys of rifle-shots.\r\n\r\nAguinaldo and his Government had hastened north towards Tarlac, and\r\non April 28 he instructed General Antonio Luna to discuss terms of\r\npeace. Ostensibly with this object the general sent Colonel Manuel\r\nArgueelles with his aide-de-camp and an orderly to the American camp at\r\nApalit (Pampanga). These men were seen coming down the railway-track\r\ncarrying a white flag. An officer was sent out to meet them, and\r\nafter handing their credentials to him they were forthwith conducted\r\nto General Wheaton's headquarters. General Wheaton sent them on\r\nto General McArthur, the chief commander of the Northern Division,\r\nand General McArthur commissioned Major Mallory to escort them to\r\nGeneral Otis in Manila. They explained that they were empowered to ask\r\nfor an armistice for a few days as it was proposed to summon their\r\nCongress for May 1 to discuss the question of peace or war. General\r\nOtis replied that he did not recognize the Philippine Republic, and\r\nthat there would be no cessation of hostilities until his only terms\r\nwere complied with, namely, unconditional surrender. The negotiations\r\nwere resumed the next day, and Argueelles seemed personally inclined\r\nto meet the American view of the situation; but as his powers were\r\nlimited to asking for an armistice, he and his companions returned to\r\nthe insurgent camp with General Otis's negative answer. On his return\r\nto the camp Colonel Argueelles was accused of being an \"Americanista\"\r\nin favour of surrender, for which offence a court-martial passed\r\nsentence upon him of expulsion from the insurgent army and 12 years'\r\nimprisonment. Whatever Argueelles' personal conviction may have been\r\nmatters little, but in the light of subsequent events and considering\r\nthe impetuous, intransigent character of General Antonio Luna, it is\r\nprobable that Argueelles was really only sent as a spy.\r\n\r\nOn May 5 General McArthur's division advanced to Pampanga Province,\r\nand Santo Tomas and San Fernando were taken without loss. A portion of\r\nthe latter place had been burnt by the retreating insurgents, and the\r\ntownspeople fled leaving their household goods behind them. Generals\r\nHale and Lawton were following up, and on the way Baliuag (Bulacan)\r\nwas occupied and immense stores of foodstuffs were seized from the\r\ninsurgents and private owners. The booty consisted of about 150,000\r\nbushels of rice and over 250 tons of sugar. In other places on the\r\nway large deposits of food fell into American hands. The men of the\r\nNebraska Regiment considered they had had sufficient hard work for the\r\npresent in long marching, continual fighting, and outpost duty. They\r\ntherefore petitioned General McArthur to relieve them temporarily\r\nfrom duty to recuperate their strength. There was no doubting their\r\nbravery, of which they had given ample proof; they had simply reached\r\nthe limit of physical endurance. The hospitals were already full of\r\nsoldiers suffering as much from sunstroke as from wounds received\r\nin battle. Consequently some of the regular regiments who had been\r\ndoing guard duty in the capital were despatched to the front. In the\r\nfollowing July the Nebraska Volunteer Regiment was one of those sent\r\nback to the United States.\r\n\r\nOn May 19 another party of insurgent officers presented themselves\r\nto the military authorities alleging that they had fuller\r\npowers than Argueelles possessed and were prepared to make peace\r\nproposals. Everything was discussed over again; but as General Otis's\r\nunalterable demand for unconditional surrender was already well known,\r\none can only conclude that the insurgent commissioners were also spies\r\nsent to gauge the power and feeling of the Americans, for they promised\r\nto return within three weeks and then disappeared indefinitely.\r\n\r\nOn May 22 more peace commissioners were sent by Aguinaldo. They were\r\nreceived by the Schurman Commission of Inquest, who communicated to\r\nthem a scheme of government which they had had under consideration\r\nin agreement with President McKinley. The proposed plan embodied\r\nthe appointment of a Gov.-General, who would nominate a Cabinet to\r\nact with him. The President of the United States was to appoint the\r\njudges. The Cabinet members and the judges might be all Americans, or\r\nall Filipinos, or both. Moreover, there was to be an Advisory Council\r\nelected by popular vote. This liberal scheme was, however, abandoned,\r\nas its proposal seemed to have no effect in bringing the war to an\r\nend, and the negotiations terminated with the Commissioners and the\r\ninsurgent delegates lunching together on board the U.S. battleship\r\n_Oregon_, whilst the blood of both parties continued to flow on\r\nthe battlefield.\r\n\r\nGeneral Lawton's brigade was still operating in the Provinces of\r\nBulacan and north of Manila (now called Rizal). The fighting was so\r\nsevere and the exposure to sun so disastrous that about the beginning\r\nof June he had to send back to Manila 500 wounded and heat-stricken\r\nmen. It was found impossible to follow up the ever-retreating\r\ninsurgents, who again escaped still farther north. Along the Manila\r\nBay shore detachments of insurgents passed from time to time, driving\r\nwomen and children before them, so that the Americans would not care to\r\nfire on them. Some, however, were picked off from the warships when the\r\ninsurgents omitted their precautionary measure. It was impossible to\r\n\"round up\" the enemy and bring him into a combat to the finish. His\r\nmovements were so alert that he would fight, vanish in a trice,\r\nconceal his arms and uniform, and mingle with the Americans with an\r\nair of perfect innocence. With wonderful dexterity he would change from\r\nsoldier to civilian, lounging one day in the market-place and the next\r\nday fall into the insurgent ranks. These tactics, which led to nothing\r\nwhatever in a purely military sense, were evidently adopted in the vain\r\nhope of wearying the Americans into an abandonment of their enterprise.\r\n\r\nIn the middle of June General Lawton's brigade operated to the south\r\nof Manila and in the Cavite province, where the natives gave battle\r\nat the Zapote River, famous for a great Spanish defeat during the\r\nrebellion. The insurgents were under cover the whole time, and their\r\nassembled thousands could hardly be seen by the attacking columns. They\r\nwere also in great force and strongly entrenched near Las Pinas and at\r\nBacoor. [212] From the former place they worked one large and two small\r\nguns with much effect, firing canister loaded with nails. One canister\r\nshattered the legs of a private. American infantry, skirmishing along\r\nthe beach, came across a posse of insurgents who at once retreated,\r\npursued by the Americans until the latter found themselves surrounded\r\non three sides by hidden sharpshooters, who poured in a raking fire\r\nupon them. The skirmishers withdrew, but were rallied by General\r\nLawton and other officers, who themselves picked off some of the\r\nenemy with rifle-shots. Encouraged by this example, the skirmishers,\r\nwith one cry, suddenly rushed towards the insurgents, scattering them\r\nin all directions, and safely reached the main body of the brigade\r\nwith their wounded comrades.\r\n\r\nThe only bridge across the Zapote River was strongly defended by\r\nthe insurgents, who had trenches forming two sides of an angle. By\r\nnoon their battery was silenced, and the Americans then attempted\r\nto ford the river, whilst others went knee-deep in mire across the\r\npaddy-mud flats. Then a deep stream was the only boundary between\r\nthe contending parties. The Filipinos were hardly visible, being\r\nunder shelter of thickets, whilst the Americans were wading through\r\nmud under a broiling sun for over two hours to reach them, keeping\r\nup a constant fusillade. The whole time there was an incessant din\r\nfrom a thousand rifles and the roar of cannon from the gunboats which\r\nbombarded the enemy's position near Las Pinas and Bacoor. The strain\r\non the Americans was tremendous when the insurgents made a flanking\r\nmovement and fired upon them as they were floundering in the mud. The\r\n14th Infantry eventually swam across the Zapote River, and under cover\r\nof artillery charged the insurgents, who retreated into the woods. The\r\nFilipinos displayed a rare intelligence in the construction of their\r\ndefences near the Zapote River and its neighbourhood, and but for the\r\nemployment of artillery their dislodgement therefrom would have been\r\nextremely difficult. After the battle was over General Lawton declared\r\nthat it was the toughest contest they had yet undertaken in this war.\r\n\r\nAt Perez Dasmarinas, in the east of Cavite Province, a battalion of\r\ninfantry narrowly escaped annihilation. News had been brought to the\r\nAmerican camp that the insurgents had evacuated that town, and that\r\nthe native mayor was disposed to make a formal surrender of it to the\r\nAmericans. The battalion forthwith went there to take possession, but\r\nbefore reaching the place the enemy closed in on all sides, and a heavy\r\nfire was mutually sustained for four hours. The Americans had only just\r\nsaved themselves from destruction by a desperate bayonet-charge when\r\nthey were rescued by General Wheaton, who arrived with reinforcements.\r\n\r\nThree months of warfare had wrought dissension in the insurgent\r\ncamp. Organization was Aguinaldo's peculiar talent, without the\r\nexercise of which the movement would have failed at the outset. But\r\nthe value of this gift was not fully appreciated by his people. A\r\ncertain section of the fighting masses had far greater admiration\r\nfor Antonio Luna's visible prowess than for the unseen astuteness\r\nof Aguinaldo's manoeuvres. It was characteristic of the Filipinos to\r\nsplit into factions, but the encouragement given to General Antonio\r\nLuna's aspiration to supersede his supreme chief was unfortunate, for\r\nAguinaldo was not the man to tolerate a rival. He had rid himself of\r\nAndres Bonifacio (_vide_ p. 371) in 1896, and now another disturber\r\nof that unity which is strength had to be disposed of. The point\r\nof dispute between these two men was of public knowledge. It has\r\nalready been shown how fully cognizant Antonio Luna was of the\r\nproposals made to the Americans for an armistice, for the express\r\npurpose of taking the vote of the Revolutionary Congress, for peace\r\nor war, on May 1. Aguinaldo was no longer a military dictator, but\r\nPresident of the so-called Philippine Republic (_vide_ p. 486), by\r\nwhose will he was disposed loyally to abide. Antonio Luna's elastic\r\nconscience urged him to duplicity; he pretended to submit to the will\r\nof the majority, expressed through the Congress, with the reserved\r\nintention of carrying on the war at all hazards, as military dictator,\r\nif the vote were for peace. Congress met, and during the debate on\r\nthe momentous question--peace or war--the hitherto compact group of\r\nintransigents weakened. No agreement could be arrived at in the first\r\nsession. There was, however, a strong tendency to accept American\r\nsovereignty. Luna feared that Aguinaldo's acceptance of the vote\r\nof the majority (if a division were taken) might deprive him of the\r\nopportunity of rising to supreme eminence. Luna's violence at this\r\ntime was intolerable, up to the point of smacking deputy F.B. in the\r\nface. His attempted coercion of the will of others brought about his\r\nown downfall. His impetuosity called forth the expression, \"He is\r\na fanatic who will lead us to a precipice.\" In his imagination, all\r\nwho did not conform to his dominant will were conspirators against\r\nhim. Hence, at Cavite (Aguinaldo's native province), he disarmed all\r\nthe troops of that locality, and substituted Ilocanos of his own\r\nprovince, whilst he vented his ferocity in numerous executions of\r\nTagalogs. Had he lived he would probably have created a tribal feud\r\nbetween Ilocanos and Tagalogs.\r\n\r\nOn June 3, 1899, accompanied by his aide-de-camp, Captain Roman, and\r\nan escort, Luna entered the official residence of President Aguinaldo\r\nat Cabanatuan (Nueva Ecija). The guard, composed of a company of\r\nCavite men from Canit (Aguinaldo's native town), under the command\r\nof Captain Pedro Janolino, saluted him on his entry. As Luna and\r\nRoman ascended the staircase to seek Aguinaldo a revolver-shot was\r\nheard. Luna rushed down the stairs in a furious rage and insulted\r\nCaptain Janolino in the presence of his troops. This was too much\r\nfor Janolino, who drew a dagger and thrust it violently into Luna's\r\nhead. In the scuffle Luna was knocked down and shot several times. He\r\nwas able to reach the roadway, and, after shouting \"Cowards!\" fell\r\ndown dead. In the meantime, whilst Captain Roman was running towards\r\na house he was shot dead by a bullet in his breast. The Insurgent\r\nGovernment passed a vote of regret at the occurrence, and the two\r\nofficers were buried with military honours. As subsequent events\r\nproved, Aguinaldo had no personal wish to give up the struggle, or\r\nto influence a peace vote, but to execute the will of the people,\r\nas expressed through the revolutionary congressmen.\r\n\r\nThe situation was becoming so serious for the Americans that a call for\r\n25,000 more volunteers was earnestly discussed at Washington. It was\r\nthought that the levy should be made at once, believing that General\r\nOtis really required them, but that he was reluctant to admit an\r\nunder-estimate of the enemy's strength. The insurgents, finding they\r\nwere not followed up (the rainy season was commencing), were beginning\r\nto take the offensive with greater boldness, attacking the Americans\r\nin the rear. The War Department, however, hesitated to make the levy\r\nowing to the friction which existed between the volunteers and the\r\nregulars, but the case was so urgent that at the end of June it was\r\ndecided to raise the total forces in the Philippines to 40,000 men.\r\n\r\nOn June 12, the anniversary of the proclamation at Cavite of\r\nPhilippine Independence, Aguinaldo, from his northern retreat, issued\r\na _Manifiesto_ to his countrymen reminding them of the importance\r\nof that event. This document, abundant in grandiloquent phrases,\r\nis too lengthy for full citation here, but the following paragraph\r\nin it is interesting as a recognition that, after all, there was a\r\nbright side to Spanish dominion:--\r\n\r\n\r\n    Filipinas! Beloved daughter of the ardent sun of the tropics,\r\n    commended by Providence to the care of noble Spain, be thou not\r\n    ungrateful; acknowledge her, salute her who warmed thee with the\r\n    breath of her own culture and civility. Thou hast longed for\r\n    independence, and thine emancipation from Spain has come; but\r\n    preserve in thine heart the remembrance of the more than three\r\n    centuries which thou hast lived with her usages, her language,\r\n    and her customs. It is true she sought to crush thine aspiration\r\n    for independence, just as a loving mother resists the lifelong\r\n    separation from the daughter of her bosom; it only proved the\r\n    excess of affection, the love Spain feels for thee. But thou,\r\n    Filipinas, flower of the ocean, delicate flower of the East, still\r\n    weak, scarce eight months weaned from thy mother's breast, hast\r\n    dared to brave a great and powerful nation such as is the United\r\n    States, with thy little army barely disciplined and shaped. Ah,\r\n    beloved brethren, all this is true; and still we say we will be\r\n    slaves to none, nor let ourselves be duped by gentle words.\r\n\r\n\r\nCertainly Aguinaldo could not have been the author of the above\r\ncomposition published in his name.\r\n\r\nBy the middle of July the censorship of Press cablegrams from Manila\r\nhad become so rigid that the public in America and Europe could get\r\nvery little reliable telegraphic news of what was going on in the\r\nIslands. The American newspaper correspondents therefore signed a\r\n\"round robin\" setting forth their complaints to General Otis, who took\r\nlittle heed of it. It was well known that the hospitals were crowded\r\nwith American soldiers, a great many of whom were suffering solely from\r\ntheir persistence in habits contracted at home which were incompatible\r\nwith good health in a tropical climate. Many volunteers, wearied of the\r\nwar, were urging to be sent back to the States, and there was a marked\r\nlack of cordiality between the volunteer and the regular regiments. In\r\nthe field the former might well compare with the smartest and the\r\nbravest men who ever carried arms; off active service there was a\r\ndifference between them and the disciplined regulars perceptible to\r\nany civilian. The natives particularly resented the volunteers' habit\r\nof entering their dwellings and tampering, in a free and easy manner,\r\nwith their goods and the modesty of their women. They were specially\r\ndisgusted with the coloured regiments, whose conduct was such that\r\nthe authorities saw the desirability of shipping them all back to the\r\nUnited States as soon as other troops were available to replace them,\r\nfor their lawlessness was bringing discredit on the nation.\r\n\r\nIn July an expedition was sent up the Laguna de Bay, and the towns on\r\nthe south shore were successively captured as far as Calamba, which\r\nwas occupied on the 26th of the month. Early in the same month the\r\ninter-island merchant steamer _Saturnus_, on its regular voyage to the\r\nnorth-west coast of Luzon ports, put in at San Fernando de la Union to\r\ndischarge cargo for that place, which was held by the insurgents. The\r\nvessel was flying the American flag. Part of the cargo had been\r\ndischarged and preparations were being made to receive freight on\r\nboard, when the insurgents seized the vessel, carried off the thousands\r\nof pesos and other property on board, poured petroleum on the woodwork,\r\nand hauled down the American flag. The American gunboat _Pampanga_,\r\npatrolling this coast, seeing there was something irregular, hove to\r\nand endeavoured to get a tow-line over the _Saturnus_, but was beaten\r\noff by the insurgents' fire from shore. The insurgents then brought\r\nfield-pieces into action and shelled the _Saturnus_, setting her on\r\nfire. The vessel became a wreck and sank near the beach. Subsequently\r\na gunboat was sent to San Fernando de la Union to shell the town.\r\n\r\nWhen the wet season had fully set in, operations of importance were\r\nnecessarily suspended. Skirmishes and small encounters occurred in\r\nmany places where the contending parties chanced to meet, but no\r\nfurther remarkable military event happened in this year of 1899 until\r\nthe north-east monsoon brought a cessation of the deluging rains.\r\n\r\nNotwithstanding General Otis's oft-repeated intimation of\r\n\"unconditional surrender\" as the sole terms of peace, in October\r\nGeneral Aguinaldo sent General Alejandrino from his new seat of\r\ngovernment in Tarlac to General Otis with fresh proposals, but\r\nthe letter was returned unopened. At that time Aguinaldo's army\r\nwas estimated at 12,000 men. The insurgents had taken many American\r\nprisoners, some of whom were released a few days afterwards, and, in\r\nOctober, Aguinaldo issued a decree voluntarily granting liberty to all\r\nAmericans held captive by his people. This resolution, proclaimed as\r\nan act of grace, was really owing to the scarcity of food, and for the\r\nsame reason Aguinaldo simultaneously disbanded a portion of his army.\r\n\r\nIn the month of December General Lawton led his brigade to the district\r\nof Montalban and San Mateo, a few miles north of Manila, to attack the\r\ninsurgents. The agreed plan was to make a flanking movement against\r\nthe enemy on the San Mateo River and a frontal attack immediately the\r\nenemy was engaged. The frontal attack was being personally directed\r\nby the general, who stood on the high bank of the river. Captain\r\nBreckinridge, the general's aide-de-camp, had just been hit in the\r\ngroin, and General Lawton went to speak to him before he was carried\r\naway on a litter. Whilst so engaged, the general threw up his hands\r\nand fell without uttering a word. He had been shot through the heart,\r\nand died instantly. His body was carried to Manila for public burial,\r\nand the insurgents were as jubilant as the Americans were grieved\r\nover this sad occurrence. The date was fixed for the interment with\r\nmilitary pomp, and immense crowds came out to witness the imposing\r\nprocession. Some Filipinos, expecting the cortege would pass through\r\na certain street, deposited a bomb in the house of an old woman,\r\nunknown to her, but fortunately for her and all concerned, it was\r\nnot on the route taken. In memory of the late lamented general the\r\npresent five-peso bank notes bear his vignette.\r\n\r\nIn 1900 the war of independence began to wane. In January,\r\nGeneral Joseph Wheeler left Manila to assume command of the late\r\nGeneral Lawton's brigade, and overran the Laguna de Bay south shore\r\ntowns. Vinan was taken on January 1, but as no garrison was left there,\r\nthe insurgents re-entered the town when the Americans passed on. The\r\narmed natives were, in reality, playing a game of hide-and-seek,\r\nwith no tangible result to themselves further than feeding at the\r\nexpense of the townspeople. Aguinaldo was still roaming about central\r\nLuzon, but, one by one, his generals either surrendered or were\r\ncaptured. Among these was General Rizal, captured in January. In\r\nthis month a plot to blow up the foreign consuls was opportunely\r\nfrustrated. The Chinese General Paua, Aguinaldo's brother-in-law,\r\nsurrendered in March and found shopkeeping in Binondo a less risky\r\nbusiness than generalship. In the same month the Manila-Dagupan\r\nRailway was handed over to the company's management, after having\r\nbeen used for war purposes. General Montenegro surrendered in April,\r\nand a fortnight afterwards Don Pedro A. Paterno, late President of\r\nthe Insurgent Congress, was captured at Antomoc (Beuguet district);\r\nGenerals Garcia and Dumangtay were captured; five officers and two\r\ncompanies of insurgents surrendered in May; and in the same month one\r\nGabriel Cayaban, of Pangasinan Province, was sentenced to five years'\r\nhard labour and a fine of 2,000 pesos for conspiring with guerillas\r\nto raise riot. It cannot be said that the insurgents in the field had\r\nadvanced one step towards the attainment of their object. Manila was\r\nsimultaneously full of conspirators cogitating over murderous plots\r\nagainst the Americans, and a band of them was arrested in the month\r\nof May. The insurgent movement was so far disorganized that it was\r\ndeemed opportune to entrust natives with police duties, and in June\r\na Philippine cavalry corps was created. Captain Lara, of the native\r\npolice, took Generals Pio del Pilar and Salvador Estrella prisoners,\r\nbut was himself assassinated on August 4. General Maximino Hizon [213]\r\nwas captured at Mexico (Pampanga), and on June 21 the Military Governor\r\npublished an amnesty proclamation, granting pardon and liberty to\r\nall who should declare their allegiance to the United States within\r\nninety days. All who had surrendered and some who were captured\r\ntook the required oath, and others were coming in. Pio del Pilar was\r\namong those who accepted the amnesty a week after its promulgation,\r\nbut he was again arrested, September 6, for conspiracy. The Amnesty\r\nProclamation was met by a counter-proclamation issued by Aguinaldo,\r\ndated August 3, 1900, in which he urged a continuance of the war,\r\nand offered rewards for arms. He promised to liberate all prisoners\r\nof war who might fall into insurgent hands, on surrender of their\r\narms and ammunition. He would give them money to return to their\r\nlines and for petty expenses _en route_. He would pay 80 pesos for\r\nevery American rifle brought in by a prisoner, and 20 pesos for any\r\nrifle voluntarily brought to a Philippine officer, but the deserter\r\nwould not be allowed to enter the insurgent ranks.\r\n\r\nOn June 28 there was an attempted rising in Manila, and Don Pedro\r\nA. Paterno was placed under closer guard. In July the insurgents were\r\nactive in the neighbourhood of Vigan (Ilocos). About 40 volunteer\r\ninfantry and 60 cavalry went out from Narvican to attack them, and\r\ncame across a strongly-entrenched position held by about 300 riflemen\r\nand 1,000 men armed with bowie-knives. A sharp fight ensued, but the\r\nAmericans, overwhelmed by the mass, had to retreat to Narvican. The\r\ninsurgents lost about a hundred men, whilst the American loss was one\r\nlieutenant and four men killed, nine wounded and four missing. About\r\nthe same time, the insurgents driven back from the Laguna de Bay\r\nshore occupied Taal (Batangas), where, under the leadership of\r\nMiguel Malvar, a small battle was fought in the streets on July 12\r\nand the town was burnt; a troop of cavalry was added to the police\r\nforce this month, and there was no lack of Filipinos willing to\r\nco-operate with Americans for a salary. The backbone of insurgency\r\nhaving been broken, the dollar proved to be a mightier factor than\r\nthe sword in the process of pacification. Compared with former times,\r\nthe ex-insurgents found in the lucrative employments offered to them\r\nby the Americans a veritable El Dorado, for never before had they\r\nseen such a flow of cash. The country had been ravaged; the immense\r\nstores collected by the revolutionists had been seized; non-combatant\r\npartisans of the insurgent cause were wearied of paying heavy taxes\r\nfor so little result; treasure was hidden; fields lay fallow, and for\r\nwant of food Aguinaldo had had partially to disband his army. He told\r\nme himself that on one occasion they were so hard pressed for food\r\nthat they had to live for three days on whatever they could find in\r\nthe mountains. There were but two courses open to the majority of the\r\nex-soldiers--brigandage or service under their new masters. Some chose\r\nthe former, with results which will be hereafter referred to; others,\r\nmore disposed towards civil life, were allured by the abundance of\r\nsilver pesos, which made a final conquest where shot and shell had\r\nfailed. Still, there were thousands incognizant of the olive-branch\r\nextended to them, and military operations had to be continued even\r\nwithin a day's journey from the capital. A request had to be made\r\nfor more cavalry to be sent to the Islands, and the proportion of\r\nthis branch of the service to infantry was gradually increased, for\r\n\"rounding up\" insurgents who refused to give battle was exhausting\r\nwork for white foot-soldiers in the tropics. In the course of four\r\nmonths nearly all the infantry in the small towns was replaced by\r\ncavalry. In this same month (July) American cavalry successfully\r\nsecured the Laguna de Bay south shore towns which the insurgents had\r\nre-taken on the departure of the infantry sent there in January. Many\r\nwell-to-do proprietors in these towns (some known to me for 20 years),\r\nespecially in Vinan, complained to me of what they considered an\r\ninjustice inflicted on them. The American troops came and drove out\r\nthe insurgents, or caused them to decamp on their approach; but, as\r\nthey left no garrisons, the insurgents re-entered and the townspeople\r\nhad to feed them under duress. Then, when the American forces returned\r\nsix months afterwards, to the great relief of the inhabitants, and\r\nleft garrisons, many of these townspeople, on a charge of having given\r\nsuccour to the insurgents, were imprisoned with the only consolation\r\nthat, after all, a couple of months' incarceration by the Americans\r\nwas preferable to the death which awaited them at the hands of the\r\ninsurgents if they had refused them food. The same thing occurred in\r\nother islands, notably in Samar and in Cebu, where the people were\r\npersecuted for giving aid to the armed natives on whose mercy their\r\nlives depended. This measure was an unfortunate mistake, because it\r\nalienated the good feeling of those who simply desired peace with the\r\nruling power, whether it were American or native. There were thousands\r\nof persons--as there would be anywhere in the world--quite incapable\r\nof taking up arms in defence of an absent party which gave them no\r\nprotection, yet naturally anxious to save their lives by payment if\r\nneed be. [214]\r\n\r\nOn July 19 a proclamation was issued forbidding the possession\r\nof firearms without licence. On August 7 the curfew ordinance was\r\nextended to 11 p.m., and again, in the following month, to midnight. In\r\nSeptember there was another serious outbreak up the Laguna de Bay,\r\nwhere two or three hundred insurgents, led by a French half-caste,\r\nGeneral Cailles, [215] attacked Los Banos, and about the same time\r\nthe insurgents north of Manila cut the railroad between Malolos and\r\nGuiguinto. Cailles was driven out of Los Banos, but hundreds more\r\ninsurgents joined him, and a furious battle was fought at Siniloan,\r\non September 17, between 800 insurgents and a company of the 15th\r\nInfantry, who drove the enemy into the mountains.\r\n\r\nIn November Aguinaldo, who was camping in the province of Nueva Ecija,\r\nissued another of his numerous exhortations, in consequence of which\r\nthere was renewed activity amongst the roaming bands of adventurers\r\nall over the provinces north of the capital. The insurgent chief\r\nadvocated an aggressive war, and in the same month it was decided to\r\nsend more American troops to Manila.\r\n\r\nMany of the riff-raff had been inadvertently enrolled in the native\r\npolice force, and received heavy sentences for theft, blackmail, and\r\nviolent abuse of their functions. Indeed it took nearly a couple of\r\nyears to weed out the disreputable members of this body. The total\r\narmy forces in the Islands amounted to about 70,000 men, and at the\r\nend of 1900 it was decided to send back the volunteer corps to America\r\nearly in the following year, for, at this period, General Aguinaldo had\r\nbecome a wanderer with a following which could no longer be called an\r\narmy, and an early collapse of the revolutionary party in the field\r\nwas an anticipated event.\r\n\r\nFrom September 1, 1900, the legislative power of the military\r\ngovernment was transferred to a civil government, Governor W. H. Taft\r\nbeing the President of the Philippine Commission, whilst Maj.-General\r\nMcArthur continued in his capacity of Commander-in-Chief to carry\r\non the war against the insurgents, which culminated in the capture\r\nof General Emilio Aguinaldo on March 23, 1901. This important event\r\naccelerated the close of the War of Independence. On January 14 General\r\nEmilio Aguinaldo had his headquarters at Palanan (Isabela), on the\r\nbank of a river which empties itself into Palanan Bay, situated about\r\nsix miles distant from the town, on the east coast of Luzon. Being in\r\nwant of reinforcements, he sent a member of his staff with messages to\r\nthat effect to several of his subordinate generals. The fellow turned\r\ntraitor, and carried the despatches to an American lieutenant, who sent\r\nhim on to Colonel Frederick Funston at San Isidro (Nueva Ecija). The\r\ndespatches disclosed the fact that General Emilio Aguinaldo requested\r\nhis cousin, General Baldomero Aguinaldo, to send him, as soon as\r\npossible, 400 armed men. With General McArthur's approval, Colonel\r\nFunston proceeded to carry out a plan which he had conceived for the\r\ncapture of General Emilio Aguinaldo. An expedition was made up of four\r\nTagalog deserters from Aguinaldo's army, 78 Macabebe scouts (_vide_\r\np. 446, footnote), and four American officers, besides Colonel Funston\r\nhimself. Twenty of the scouts were dressed in insurgent uniforms,\r\nand the remaining natives in common working-clothes. Ten of them\r\ncarried Spanish rifles, ten others had Krag-Joergensen rifles, which\r\nthey were to feign to have captured from American troops, and the\r\nfive Americans were disguised as private soldiers. The party was then\r\ncarried round the north and east coasts of Luzon, and put ashore in the\r\nneighbourhood of Baler by the gunboat _Vicksburg_, which approached the\r\ncoast without lights, and then waited off Palanan Bay. The expedition\r\nwas nominally commanded by an insurgent deserter, Hilario Placido,\r\n[216] whilst three other deserters posed as officers, the Americans\r\nplaying the _role_ of prisoners captured by the party. Before setting\r\nout for Casiguran, some 20 miles away, a messenger was sent on to\r\nthe native headman of that town to tell him that reinforcements for\r\nAguinaldo were on their way, and would require food and lodging, which\r\nwere forthwith furnished by the headman to these 87 individuals. Some\r\nmonths previously some papers had been captured bearing the signature\r\nand seal of the insurgent general Lacuna, and this enabled the party\r\nto send on a letter in advance to Emilio Aguinaldo, ostensibly in the\r\nname of Lacuna, announcing the arrival of the reinforcements furnished\r\nin response to his request of January 14. This letter was accompanied\r\nby another one from the pseudo-chief of the expedition, stating that\r\non the way they had captured five American soldiers and ten Krag\r\nrifles. A request was also made for food, which he explained had run\r\nshort. Emilio Aguinaldo, therefore, sent Negritos to meet them on the\r\nway with a supply of rice. In the morning of March 23 they were near\r\nPalanan. The Macabebe scouts were sent in advance of the _soi-disant_\r\nfive American prisoners, and when they entered the town Aguinaldo's\r\nbodyguard of 50 men was drawn up in parade to receive them. The\r\nnative pseudo-officers marched into the camp, and were welcomed by\r\nAguinaldo; but they shortly afterwards took temporary leave of him,\r\nand coming outside ordered their Macabebe troops to form up. Just at\r\nthe moment the five supposed prisoners were conducted towards the camp\r\nthe Macabebes poured three murderous volleys into Aguinaldo's troops,\r\ntwo of whom were killed and 18 wounded. On the other side only one\r\nMacabebe was slightly wounded. The Americans witnessed the effect of\r\nthe first volley, and, together with the natives posing as officers,\r\nrushed into Aguinaldo's headquarters. Aguinaldo, Colonel Villa, and\r\none civilian were taken prisoners, whilst other insurgent officers\r\njumped from the window into the river and escaped. The expedition,\r\nafter resting a day and a half at the camp, escorted their prisoners\r\nto Palanan Bay, where they were all taken on board the gunboat\r\n_Vicksburg_, which reached Manila on March 27.\r\n\r\nThe closing scene in Emilio Aguinaldo's military career was a\r\nremarkable performance of consummate skill, but unworthy of record\r\nin the annals of military glory.\r\n\r\nThe War of Independence, which lasted until the next year, was a\r\ntriumph of science over personal valour about equally balanced. It\r\nwas a necessary sacrifice of the few for the good of the many. No\r\npermanent peace could have been ever hoped for so long as the Islanders\r\nentertained the belief that they could any day eject the invaders\r\nby force.\r\n\r\nThe American citizens naturally rejoiced over the bare fact, briefly\r\ncabled without ghastly details, that the Philippine generalissimo had\r\nfallen prisoner, because it portended the peace which all desired. In\r\ndeference to public opinion, the President promoted Colonel Funston\r\nof the volunteers to the rank of Brig.-General in the regular army.\r\n\r\nEmilio Aguinaldo was first taken before General McArthur and then\r\nescorted to prison in _Calle de Anda_, in the walled city. On April 1,\r\n1901, he took the oath of allegiance in the following form, viz.:--\r\n\r\n\r\n    I, Emilio Aguinaldo, hereby renounce all allegiance to any and\r\n    all so-called revolutionary governments in the Philippine Islands\r\n    and recognize and accept the supreme authority of the United\r\n    States of America therein; I do solemnly swear that I will bear\r\n    true faith and allegiance to that Government; that I will at all\r\n    times conduct myself as a faithful and law-abiding citizen of\r\n    the said Islands, and will not, either directly or indirectly,\r\n    hold correspondence with or give intelligence to an enemy of the\r\n    United States, nor will I abet, harbour or protect such enemy;\r\n    that I impose upon myself these voluntary obligations without\r\n    any mental reservations or purpose of evasion, so help me God.\r\n\r\n\r\nAfter signing this declaration he was a free man. For a while he\r\nresided at Malacanan, on the north bank of the Pasig River, where one\r\nnight a pirogue full of assassins came to seek the life of the man who\r\nhad failed. But his lucky star followed him, and he removed to Paco and\r\nagain to Ermita (suburbs of Manila) and finally to his native town of\r\nCauit (Cavite), where I was his guest. He was living there in modest\r\nretirement with his mother and his two good-looking young nieces, who\r\nserved us at table. The house is large and comparatively imposing as\r\na provincial residence, being formed of two good substantial houses\r\nconnected by a bridge-passage. The whole is enclosed by a low brick\r\nwall, topped by iron railings painted flaming red. In front there is a\r\ngarden and a spacious compound at the back. In the large drawing-room\r\nthere is a ceiling fresco representing a Filipina descending a flight\r\nof steps from a column to which the chains, now severed, held her\r\ncaptive. On the steps lies the Spanish flag with a broken staff,\r\nand in her hand she holds on high the Philippine flag of freedom.\r\n\r\nIn conversation with him he stated that he and his companions returned\r\nto the Islands in May, 1898, with many assurances that America was\r\nsimply going to aid them to gain their independence. He added that\r\nwhen he landed at Cavite he had no arms, and the Americans allowed\r\nhim to take them from the Spanish arsenal. Then they turned him out,\r\nand he moved his headquarters to Bacoor, where his troops numbered\r\nbetween 30,000 and 35,000 men. He said he could easily have taken\r\nManila then, but that he was begged not to do so as the Americans\r\nwere waiting for more troops and they wished to make the victory a\r\njoint one. He confessed he had bought experience very dearly. But he\r\nprofited by that experience when, at Cavite, the Belgian Consul and\r\nPrince Loewenstein came four times to make proposals to him in favour\r\nof Germany. The first time, he said, he received them and demanded\r\ntheir credentials as authorized agents for Germany, but, as they\r\ncould not produce any, he declined to have any further intercourse\r\nwith them. Referring to the first period of the rebellion, Aguinaldo\r\nadmitted that the prospect of ejecting the Spaniards from the Islands\r\nwas very doubtful.\r\n\r\nImmediately Aguinaldo had fallen captive, all kinds of extravagant and\r\nerroneous versions were current as to how it had happened. Thousands\r\ninsisted that he must have voluntarily surrendered, for how could he\r\nhave been caught when he had the _anting-anting_? (_vide_ p. 237). As\r\nthe ball of conjecture went on rolling, some added to this that\r\nhis voluntary surrender must have been for a money consideration,\r\nand there were still others who furnished a further inducement--his\r\nfear of revenge from the late Antonio Luna's party!\r\n\r\nAlthough Aguinaldo gave no proof of being a brilliant warrior,\r\nas an organizer he had no rival capable of keeping 30,000 or more\r\nFilipinos united by sentiment for any one purpose. He trusted no\r\ncomrade implicitly, and for a long time his officers had to leave\r\ntheir side-arms in an antechamber before entering his apartment. He\r\nhad, moreover, the adroitness to extirpate that rivalry which alone\r\ndestroys all united effort. But the world makes no allowance for the\r\ngeneral who fails. To-day he is left entirely alone, pitied by some,\r\nshunned by a few, and almost forgotten by the large majority. He is\r\nindeed worthy of respect for his humanity in the conduct of the war,\r\nand of some pity in his present peculiar position. Many of his late\r\nsubordinates now occupy good and high-salaried posts. Members of the\r\nGovernment of which he was President have espoused American doctrine\r\nand enjoy high social positions and fat emoluments. Aguinaldo's\r\nscholarship is too meagre for an elevated position, and his dignity\r\nand self-respect too great for an inferior one.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXV\r\n\r\nThe Philippine Republic in the Central and Southern Islands\r\n\r\n\r\nSo interwoven were the circumstances of General Aguinaldo's Government\r\nin Luzon Island with the events of the period between the naval battle\r\nof Cavite and the ratification of the Treaty of Paris, that they form\r\nan integral and inseparable whole in historical continuity. In the\r\nother Islands, however, which followed the revolutionary movement,\r\nwith more or less adherence to the supreme leadership of Aguinaldo, the\r\nlocal incidents severally constitute little histories in themselves,\r\neach such island having practically set up its own government with\r\nonly the barest thread of administrative intercommunication.\r\n\r\nThe smaller islands, adjacent to Luzon, cannot be justly included in\r\nthis category, because their local rule, which naturally succeeded the\r\nwithdrawal of Spanish administration, was nothing more than a divided\r\ndomination of self-constituted chiefs whose freebooting exploits,\r\nin one instance, had to be suppressed at the sacrifice of bloodshed,\r\nand, in another, to succumb to the apathy of the people.\r\n\r\nIn _Yloilo_, on December 23, 1898, General Diego de los Rios, in the\r\npresence of his staff, the naval commanders and the foreign consuls,\r\nformally surrendered the town to the native mayor, prior to his\r\nevacuation of Panay Island on the following day. On December 27\r\nan American military force (finally about 3,000 strong) arrived in\r\nthe roadstead in transports under the command of General Miller in\r\nco-operation with two American warships, afterwards supplemented by\r\ntwo others. The Spanish troops having departed, the Filipinos who had\r\nassumed control of public affairs made their formal entry into Yloilo\r\nto the strains of music and the waving of banners and constituted\r\na government whose effective jurisdiction does not appear to have\r\nextended beyond the town and a day's march therefrom. On January 17\r\nan election was held, Raymundo Melliza, [217] an excellent man, being\r\nchosen president for the term of two years. Business was resumed;\r\nsugar was being brought from Negros Island, and ships were laden with\r\nproduce. During the civil administration, which lasted for seven weeks,\r\nthe absorbing topic was the demand made by General Miller for the\r\nsurrender of the town. General Miller's force had been despatched to\r\nYloilo waters, after the signing of the Treaty of Paris, simply to make\r\na demonstration in view of possible anarchy resulting from the Spanish\r\nevacuation. The ratification of that Treaty by a two-thirds Senate\r\nmajority was not an accomplished fact until February 6 following. There\r\nwas no certainty that the Senate would confirm the acquisition of\r\nthe Islands, and in the interval it was not politic to pass from a\r\nformal demand for the surrender of Yloilo to open hostilities for\r\nits possession. These matters of political exigency were undoubtedly\r\nbeyond the comprehension of the Ylongos. They attributed to fear the\r\nfact that a large fighting-force remained inactive within sight of the\r\ntown, whereas General Miller was merely awaiting instructions from\r\nthe capital which the Manila authorities, in turn, were delaying,\r\npending the decision in Washington. Intervening circumstances,\r\nhowever, precipitated military action. On the night of February 4\r\nhostilities had broken out between Aguinaldo's troops and the American\r\nforces. Insurgent emissaries had brought Aguinaldo's messages to\r\nthe Ylongos to hold the town against the invaders, and on February 7\r\nGeneral Miller received orders from Maj.-General Otis to take Yloilo\r\nby force if necessary. General Miller thereupon renewed his demand for\r\nthe surrender of the place, coupled this time with a declaration that\r\nhe would bombard it if his demand were refused. Later on he notified\r\nthe consular body that the bombardment would commence on the 12th of\r\nthe month. During the seven weeks of native government, petty thefts\r\nwere frequent; an armed insurgent would enter a store and carry off\r\nthe article selected by him without paying for it; but there was no\r\nriotous open violence committed against the townspeople or foreign\r\ntraders. The squabbles between the armed natives and their leaders,\r\nhowever, were several times on the point of producing bloodshed.\r\n\r\nAccording to ex-insurgent General Pablo Araneta, the insurgent army,\r\nat the time, in Panay Island was as follows, viz. [218]:--\r\n\r\n\r\n    Under the leadership of     Stationed at   Tagalogs   Visayos\r\n\r\n    Fulion                      Yloilo          250         150\r\n    Ananias Diocno              Yloilo          400          --\r\n    Pablo Araneta               Yloilo          250          --\r\n    Martin Delgado              Yloilo           --         150\r\n    Pablo Araneta               Molo             --         100\r\n    Silvestre Silvio            Antique         150          --\r\n    Detachment of Diocno's\r\n    forces                      Capiz           200          --\r\n\r\n    Total all armed with guns                 1,250         400\r\n\r\n\r\nThe commander-in-chief of the whole army of 1,650 men was Martin\r\nDelgado. The Tagalog contingent was under the leadership of Ananias\r\nDiocno, a native of Taal, whose severity in his Capiz and Yloilo\r\ncampaigns has left a lasting remembrance. The headquarters of the\r\nVisayos was in the parish-house (_convento_), whilst the Tagalogs were\r\nlocated in the Fine Arts Institute. Their stipulated remuneration was\r\n4 pesos a month and food, but as they had received only 1 peso per\r\nmonth on account, and moreover claimed a rise in pay to 5 pesos, the\r\nVisayos, on February 3, assembled on the central _plaza_ of the town\r\nand menaced their general officers, who were quartered together in a\r\ncorner house over a barber's shop. They yelled out to their leaders\r\nthat if they did not give them their pay they would kill them all,\r\nsack the town, and then burn it. Thereupon the generals hastened\r\nround the town to procure funds, and appeased the Visayos with a\r\ndistribution of 1,800 pesos. The Tagalogs then broke out in much\r\nthe same way, and were likewise restrained by a payment on account\r\nof arrears due. But thenceforth the insurgent troops became quite\r\nuncontrollable and insolent to their officers. The fact that white\r\nofficers should have solicited their permission to come ashore unarmed\r\ncould only be interpreted by the Oriental, soldier or civilian, in a\r\nway highly detrimental to the white man's prestige. The Americans'\r\ngood and honest intentions were only equalled by their nescience\r\nof the Malay character. The officers came ashore; the townsfolk\r\nmarvelled, and the fighting-men, convinced of their own invincibility,\r\ndisdainfully left them unmolested. After the insurgent generals had\r\ndoled out their pay, the men went round to the shops and braggingly\r\navowed that it was lucky for the shopkeepers that they had got money,\r\notherwise they would have looted their goods. The Chinese shut up\r\ntheir shops from the beginning of the troubles, leaving only a hole\r\nin the closed door to do a little business, as they were in constant\r\nfear for the safety of their lives and their stocks. A great many\r\nfamilies packed up their belongings and went over to Negros Island in\r\nsmall schooners. The little passenger-steamers plying between Yloilo\r\nand Negros were running as usual, crowded to the brim, and flying the\r\nPhilippine flag without interruption from the Americans. Amongst the\r\nbetter classes opinions on the situation were much divided. The best\r\nPhilippine and Spanish families expressed their astonishment that\r\nthe Americans made no attempt to take the town immediately after the\r\nSpanish evacuation. There were foreign merchants anxious to delay\r\nthe American investment because, meanwhile, they were doing a brisk\r\ntrade, and there were others longing to see the town in the hands\r\nof any civilized and responsible Power. Delegates from one party\r\nor the other, including the native civil government, went off in\r\nboats almost daily to parley with General Miller in the roadstead,\r\neach with a different line of real or sophistic argument. The best\r\nnative families, the foreigners of all classes--those who desired a\r\nspeedy entry of the Americans and those who sought to delay it--were\r\nagreed as to the needlessness and the mistaken policy of announcing\r\na bombardment. Yloilo is a straggling, open town. The well-to-do\r\npeople asked, \"Why bombard?\" There were no fortifications or anything\r\nto destroy but their house property. Plans were voluntarily offered\r\nshowing how and at which points a midnight landing of 400 or 500 troops\r\ncould be secretly effected for a sunrise surprise which would have\r\ncleared the town in an hour of every armed insurgent. The officers\r\nashore declared they were ready; and as to the men, they were simply\r\nlonging for the fray, but the word of command rested with General\r\nMiller.\r\n\r\nIn the evening of February 10 the native civil government held an\r\nextraordinary session in the Town Hall to discuss the course to be\r\nadopted in view of the announced bombardment. The public, Filipinos\r\nand foreigners, were invited to this meeting to take part in the debate\r\nif they wished, Raymundo Melliza, Victorino Mapa, Martin Delgado, and\r\nPablo Araneta, being amongst those who were present. It was proposed to\r\nburn the town. Melliza vehemently protested against such a barbarous\r\nact, and asked why they should destroy their own property? What\r\ncould they gain by pillage and flames? [219] But a certain V----\r\nand his party clamoured for the destruction of the place, and being\r\nsupported by an influential lawyer (native of another province) and\r\nby one of the insurgent generals, Melliza exclaimed, \"If you insist\r\non plunder and devastation, I shall retire altogether,\" whereupon\r\na tremendous hubbub ensued, in the midst of which Melliza withdrew\r\nand went over to Guimaras Island. But there were touches of humour\r\nin the speeches, especially when a fire-eating demagogue gravely\r\nproposed to surround an American warship with canoes and seize her;\r\nand again when Quintin Salas declared that the Americans would have\r\nto pass over his corpse before the town surrendered! Incendiaries\r\nand thieves were in overwhelming majority at the meeting; naturally\r\n(to the common people in these Islands) an invitation to despoil,\r\nlay waste and slay, bolstered up by apparent authority, found a ready\r\nresponse, especially among the Tagalog mercenaries who had no local\r\nattachment here. The instigators of this barbarity sought no share\r\nof the spoils; they had no property interests in Yloilo, but they\r\nwere jealous of those who had. The animosity of Jaro and Molo against\r\nYloilo had existed for years, the formers' townspeople being envious\r\nof the prosperous development of Yloilo (once a mere fishing-village),\r\nwhich obscured the significance of the episcopal city of Jaro and\r\ndetracted from the social importance of the rich Chinese half-caste\r\nresidential town of Molo. [220] Chiefly from these towns came the\r\nadvocates of anarchy, whose hearts swelled with fiendish delight at\r\nthe prospect of witnessing the utter ruin and humiliation of their\r\nrivals in municipal prestige. Yloilo, from that moment, was abandoned\r\nto the armed rabble, who raided the small shops for petroleum to throw\r\non to the woodwork of the houses prior to the coming onslaught. The\r\nbombardment having been announced for the 12th, they reckoned on a\r\nfull day for burning and sacking the town. But early in the morning\r\nof the 11th the steam-launch _Pitt_, whilst reconnoitring the harbour,\r\nwas fired upon; the launch replied and withdrew. Natives were observed\r\nto be busy digging a trench and hastening to and from the _cotta_\r\nat the harbour entrance; there was every indication of their warlike\r\nintentions. Therefore suddenly, at 9 o'clock that morning, without\r\nfurther notification, the Americans opened fire. The natives in the\r\n_cotta_ fled along the quayway towards the centre of the town under\r\na shower of bullets hurled from the quick-firing guns. The attack\r\non Yloilo was hardly a bombardment proper; shells were intentionally\r\nthrown over the houses as a warning and burst in suburban open spaces,\r\nbut comparatively few buildings were damaged by the missiles. In\r\nthe meantime, from early morn, the native soldiery, followed by a\r\nriff-raff mob, rushed hither and thither, throwing firebrands on to the\r\npetroleum-washed houses, looting stores, and cutting down whomsoever\r\nchecked them in their wild career. The Chinese barricaded themselves,\r\nbut the flames devoured their well-stocked bazaars; panic-stricken\r\ntownsfolk ran helter-skelter, escaping from the yelling bands of\r\nbloodthirsty looters. Europeans, revolver in hand, guarded their\r\nproperties against the murderous rabble; an acquaintance of mine was\r\nhastening to the bank to deposit P3,000 when he was met by the leader\r\nS----, who demanded his money or his life; one foreign business house\r\nwas defended by 15 armed Europeans, whilst others threw out handfuls\r\nof pesos to stay the work of the _petroleur_. The German Vice-Consul,\r\nan old friend of mine, went mad at the sight of his total loss;\r\na Swiss merchant, my friend for over 20 years, had his fine corner\r\npremises burnt down to the stone walls, and is now in comparative\r\npoverty. Even Spanish half-castes were menaced and contemptuously\r\ncalled _Cachilas_ [221]; and the women escaped for their lives on\r\nboard the schooners in the harbour. Half the town was blazing, and\r\nthe despairing cries of some, the yells of exultant joy of others,\r\nmingled with the booming of the invaders' cannon.\r\n\r\nTwo British warships lying in the roadstead sent boats ashore to\r\nreceive British subjects, and landed a party of marines, who made\r\ngallant efforts to save foreign property. A few British subjects were,\r\nhowever, unable to get away from the town on account of the premature\r\nattack of the Americans, which took place on the 11th instead of\r\nFebruary 12, as previously announced.\r\n\r\nThe American assault on the town, which lasted until 1 o'clock in\r\nthe afternoon, was immediately followed up by the landing of about\r\n1,000 volunteers, and General Miller found that the prognostications\r\nof the townspeople were perfectly just, for the insurgents fled in\r\nall directions. There was not a fighting-man left in the town. Some\r\nof them continued their hurried flight as far as Santa Barbara and\r\nJaniuay. It was evident that a sudden night-landing, without a word\r\nabout bombardment, would have been just as effective, and would\r\nhave prevented much misery and loss of life and property. Indeed,\r\nthe arrival of the American volunteers under these distressing\r\ncircumstances produced a fresh commotion in Yloilo. Without any\r\nwarrant private premises were entered, and property saved from the\r\nnatives' grasp vanished before the eyes of the owners. Finally order\r\nwas restored through the energetic intervention of American officials,\r\nwho stationed sentinels here and there to protect what still remained\r\nof the townspeople's goods. In due course indemnity claims were\r\nforwarded to the military authorities, who rejected them all.\r\n\r\nThe insurgents still lingered outside the town on the road to Jaro, and\r\nGeneral Miller marched his troops, in battle array, against them. A\r\ncouple of miles out of the town, in the neighbourhood of La Paz,\r\nthe entrenched enemy was routed after a slight skirmish. The booming\r\nof cannon was heard in Yloilo for some hours as the American troops\r\ncontinued their march to Jaro, only molested by a few occasional\r\nshots from the enemy in ambush. The rebel chief Fulion and another,\r\nQuintin Salas, held out for a short while, gradually beating a retreat\r\nbefore the advancing column. The Tagalogs, once under the command of\r\nthe semi-civilized Diocno, disappeared in all directions, and finally\r\nescaped from the province in small parties in canoes or as best they\r\ncould. The handful of braves who still thought fit to resist decided\r\nto make a stand at Santa Barbara, but on the arrival of the American\r\ntroops they dispersed like chaff before the wind. General Miller then\r\nrelinquished the pursuit and returned to Yloilo to await reinforcements\r\nfor a campaign through the Island. In the meantime military government\r\nwas established in Yloilo, the town was policed, trade resumed its\r\nnormal aspect, the insurgents in the Island gradually increased,\r\nbut the Philippine Republic in Panay was no more. It was clear to\r\nall the most sober-minded and best-educated Ylongos that Aguinaldo's\r\ngovernment was a failure in Panay at least. The hope of agreement on\r\nany policy was remote from its very initiation. Visayos of position,\r\nwith property and interests at stake, were convinced that absolute\r\nindependence without any control or protection from some established\r\nPower was premature and doomed to disaster. Visayan jealousy of Tagalog\r\npredominance had also its influence, but the ruling factor was the\r\nTagalog troops' dictatorial air and brutal conduct, which destroyed\r\nthe theory of fraternal unity. Self-government at this stage would\r\nhave certainly led to civil war.\r\n\r\nReinforcements arrived from Manila and the Americans entered\r\nupon the pacification of the Island, which needed two years for\r\nits accomplishment. The full record of the Panay campaign would\r\nbe a monotonous recital of scores of petty encounters of analogous\r\ncharacter. Pablo Araneta, in co-operation with a Spanish deserter named\r\nMariano Perez, met the Americans several times, and gave better proof\r\nof his generalship in retreat than in advance. He operated only in the\r\nprovince of Yloilo, and at Sambang, near Pavia, his party was severely\r\ndefeated and the \"general\" fled. Quintin Salas, over whose dead body,\r\nhe himself declared, the Americans would have to pass before Yloilo\r\nsurrendered, appeared and disappeared, from time to time, around\r\nDumangas. There was an encounter at Potian with Jolandoni which ended\r\nbadly for his party. The native priests not only sympathized with\r\nthe insurgents, but took an active part in their operations. Father\r\nSantiago Pamplona, afterwards ecclesiastical-governor of the Visayas\r\n(Aglipayan), held a command under Martin Delgado. Father Agustin Pina,\r\nthe parish priest of Molo and the active adviser in the operations\r\naround Pavia--Jaro district, was caught by the Americans and died\r\nof \"water-cure.\" [222] The firebrand Pascual Macbanua was killed\r\nat Pototan; and finally came the most decisive engagement at Monte\r\nSingit, between Janiuay and Lambunao. The insurgent generalissimo,\r\nMartin Delgado, took the field in person; but after a bold stand, with\r\na slight loss on the American side, the insurgents were completely\r\nrouted and their leader fled. Pablo Araneta, tired of generalship\r\nwithout glory, surrendered to the Americans on December 31, 1899. The\r\nwar still continued for another year, Martin Delgado being one of\r\nthe last to declare his defeat. Early in December, 1900, overtures\r\nfor peace were made to General Miller, the delegates on the insurgent\r\nside being Pablo Araneta, Jovito Yusay, and Father Silvestre Apura,\r\nwhilst Captain Noble represented the Americans. Martin Delgado and his\r\nco-leaders soon surrendered. There was no question of conditions but\r\nthat of convincing the natives of the futility of further resistance\r\nand the benefits to them of peace under American rule. With this end\r\nin view, delegates went in commission to the several districts. Pablo\r\nAraneta, Father Silvestre Apura, Father Praxedes Magalon and Nicolas\r\nRoses visited the district of Concepcion (East Panay) in January 1901\r\nand obtained the submission of the people there. Peace was at length\r\nagreed upon; but the Filipinos were not disposed silently to draw\r\nthe veil over the past without glamour and pomp, even in the hour\r\nof defeat. Therefore, on February 2, 1901, in agreement between the\r\nparties, the remnant of the little Panay army made a formal surrender,\r\nmarching under triumphal arches into the episcopal city of Jaro\r\nto stack their arms, between lines of American troops drawn up on\r\neither side of their passage, to the strains of peaceful melody,\r\nwhilst the banners of the Stars and Stripes floated victoriously\r\nin the sultry air. Jaro was crowded with visitors to witness this\r\ninteresting ceremonial. The booths did a bustling trade; the whole\r\ncity was _en fete,_ and the vanquished heroes, far from evincing\r\nhumiliation, mingled with the mob and seemed as merry as though the\r\noccasion were the marriage-feast of the headman's daughter.\r\n\r\nBut to complete the picture of peace some finishing-strokes were yet\r\nneedful. Antique Province was still in arms, and a native commission\r\ncomposed of Pablo Araneta, Father Silvestre Apura, Father Praxedes\r\nMagalon, Victorino Mapa, Cornelio Melliza, and Martin Delgado proceeded\r\nthere, and succeeded in concluding peace for the Americans at the\r\nend of February, 1901.\r\n\r\nThe Visayan chief who defied the American invader was no stout\r\npatriot who leaves his plough to fight for cherished liberty, and\r\ncheerfully returns to it when the struggle ends. The leaders of the\r\nlittle Panay army and their civilian colleagues had to be compensated\r\nfor their acceptance of American rule. Aguinaldo was captured during\r\nthe month following the Peace of Panay; the war was coming to an end,\r\nand Governor W. H. Taft made his provincial tour to inaugurate civil\r\ngovernment in the pacified Islands. Martin T. Delgado, the very man who\r\nhad inflicted such calamities upon the Yloilo people, was appointed,\r\non April 11, to be their first provincial Civil Governor at a salary of\r\n$3,000 gold per annum, and held that office until March, 1904. Jovito\r\nYusay was given the provincial government secretaryship with a yearly\r\nstipend of $1,800 gold; Pablo Araneta was rewarded with the post of\r\nPresident of the Board of Health at an annual salary of $1,500 gold,\r\nand Victorino Mapa was appointed a judge of the Supreme Court with an\r\nannual emolument of $7,000 gold. In March, 1904, Raymundo Melliza,\r\nex-president of the native civil government, already referred to as\r\nthe advocate of social order, succeeded Delgado in the civil government\r\nof the Yloilo province by popular vote.\r\n\r\nYloilo, formerly the second port of the Philippines, is situated on\r\nthe right bank of the creek. From the creek point to the square are\r\nsheds used for sugar-storing, with, here and there, a commercial or\r\ngovernment office between. The most modern thoroughfares are traced\r\nwith regularity, and there are many good houses. In the square is the\r\nchurch, which at a distance might be mistaken for a sugar-store, the\r\nruins of the Town Hall, the convent, and a few small, fairly well-built\r\nhouses of stone and wood, whilst all one side was once covered by a\r\nfine new block of buildings of brick, stone and wood, with iron roofs.\r\n\r\nThe _Calle Real_ or High Street is a winding road, which leads through\r\nthe town into the country. The houses are indescribable--they are of\r\nall styles. Without any pretence at architectural adornment, some are\r\nhigh, others low; some stand back with several feet of pavement before\r\nthem, others come forward and oblige one to walk in the road. Here\r\nand there is a gap, then a row of dingy hovels. This is the retail\r\ntrading-quarter and the centre for the Chinese. Going from the square\r\nthe creek runs along at the back of the right-hand-side houses;\r\nturning off by the left-hand-side thoroughfares, which cannot be\r\ncalled streets, there is a number of roughly-built houses and a few\r\ngood ones dispersed in all directions, with vacant, neglected plots\r\nbetween. At the extreme end of the _Calle Real_ is the Government\r\nHouse, built of wood and stone, of good style and in a fair condition,\r\nwith quite the appearance of an official residence. Before it is a\r\nsemicircular garden, and in front of this there is a round fenced-in\r\nplot, in the middle of which stands a flag-staff. Just past the\r\nGovernment House there is a bridge crossing the Jaro River, which\r\nempties itself into the creek of Yloilo, and this creek is connected\r\nwith that of Otong. [223]\r\n\r\nYloilo lies low, and is always hot. Quite one-third of the shipping\r\nand wholesale business quarter stands on land reclaimed from the\r\nswamp by filling up with earth and rubble. The opposite side of\r\nthe creek, facing the shipping-quarter, is a low marshy waste,\r\noccasionally converted into a swamp at certain tides. The creek\r\nforms the harbour of Yloilo, which is just as Nature made it, except\r\nthat there is a roughly-constructed quayway on the left-hand shore\r\non entering. Only vessels of light draft can enter; large vessels\r\nanchor in the roadstead, which is the channel between Yloilo harbour\r\nand Guimaras Island.\r\n\r\nThe general aspect of Yloilo and its environs is most depressing. In\r\nSpanish times no public conveyances were to be seen plying for hire\r\nin the streets, and there is still no public place of amusement. The\r\nMunicipality was first established by Royal Order dated June 7, 1889.\r\n\r\nEvidences of the havoc of 1899 are still visible at every turn in\r\nYloilo in the shape of old stone walls, charred remains, battered\r\nhouses, vacant spaces, etc. On the other hand, there are many\r\ninnovations since American administration superseded the native\r\ncivil government. The _plaza_, till then a dreary open space, is\r\nnow a pleasant shady promenade; electric lighting, an ice-factory,\r\nfour hotels, one American, one English, and three Philippine clubs,\r\nlarge public schools, an improved quayway, a commodious Custom-house,\r\na great increase of harbour traffic, a superabundance of lawyers'\r\nand pawnbrokers' sign-boards, and public vehicles plying for hire are\r\namong the novelties which strike one who knew Yloilo in days gone\r\nby. The Press is poorly represented by three daily and one weekly\r\nnewspapers. Taken as a whole Yloilo still remains one of the most\r\ncharmless spots in the Archipelago.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe people of _Negros Island_ were in the free enjoyment of local\r\nindependence since November 6, 1898, the day on which the Spanish\r\nGovernor, D. Isidro Castro y Cinceros, together with all his\r\nofficial colleagues, capitulated to the revolutionists under the\r\nleadership of Aniceto Lacson, Leandro Lacson, Juan Araneta, Nicolas\r\nGales, Simon Lizares, Julio Diaz, and Jose Montilla. Simultaneously\r\nwith the prosecution of the Panay Island campaign General Miller\r\nopened negotiations for the submission of Negros Island to\r\nAmerican sovereignty. At that time the government of the Island\r\nwas being peacefully administered to the satisfaction of the Negros\r\nrevolutionists, at least, under the constitution proclaimed by them,\r\nand presided over by their ex-commander-in-chief, Aniceto Lacson. [224]\r\nGeneral Miller therefore commissioned two Filipinos, Esteban de la\r\nRama and Pedro Regalado, [225] to proceed to Negros and negotiate\r\nterms of surrender to the Americans. For the moment nothing further\r\nwas demanded than a recognition of American supremacy, and it was\r\nnot proposed to subvert their local organization or depose their\r\npresident. Aniceto Lacson accepted these terms, and General Miller\r\nformally appointed him Governor of the Island in March, 1899. It\r\nis evident, therefore, that no union existed between the local\r\ngovernment of Negros and Aguinaldo's Republic in Luzon. In fact,\r\nwhen the Tagalog fighting-men, who were everywhere defeated in Panay,\r\nmade their escape to Negros and raised the cry of insurrection against\r\nthe Americans, Lacson was constrained to appeal to General Miller to\r\nsend over troops to quell the movement. Thereupon Colonel Smith was\r\ndeputed to take troops over to Negros to pursue the common enemy,\r\nwhilst, in perfect accord with the native governor Lacson, he acted\r\nas military governor of the Island. The great cordillera which runs\r\nthrough the centre of the Island from north to south forms a sort\r\nof natural barrier between the people of Occidental and Oriental\r\nNegros. There are trails, but there are no transversal highroads\r\nfrom one coast to the other, and the inhabitants on each side live\r\nas separated in their interests, and, to a certain degree, in their\r\nhabits, as though they were living in different islands. The people\r\non the eastern side have always strongly opposed anything approaching\r\ngovernmental cohesion with the other side. Moreover, for many years\r\npast, the south-eastern district of Negros Island has been affected by\r\nsporadic apparitions of riotous religious monomaniacs called _Santones_\r\n(_vide_ p. 189). These conditions, therefore, favoured the nefarious\r\nwork of the cunning Tagalog and Panay refugees, who found plenty\r\nof plastic material in the Negros inhabitants for the fruitful\r\ndissemination of the wildest and most fantastic notions anent the\r\nhorrors awaiting them in the new Anglo-Saxon domination. They found no\r\nsympathy with the native government of Occidental Negros, which was as\r\nmuch their enemy as the American troops sent to pursue them, but they\r\nentertained the hope that by raising riot in Negros they would draw off\r\ntroops from Panay, and so favour the movement in that Island. Armed\r\ngroups rose everywhere against the Americans and the established\r\ngovernment. In the south-east the notorious Papa Isio appeared as a\r\n_Santon_, preached idolatry, and drew to his standard a large band of\r\nruffians as skilled as himself in villainous devices. Insurgency, in\r\nthe true sense of the word, did not exist in Negros; opposition to the\r\nAmerican domination was merely a pretext to harass, plunder, and extort\r\nfunds from the planters and property-owners. The disaffected people\r\nincreased so largely in numbers that Colonel Smith was obliged to call\r\nfor reinforcements, and the disturbances only came to an end when it\r\nwas known that the Panay people had formally laid down their arms in\r\nFebruary, 1901. Shortly afterwards Governor W. H. Taft visited Negros\r\nIsland; the quasi-autonomous government of that region was modified\r\nin conformity with the general plan of provincial civil governments,\r\nand on August 9, 1901, Leandro Locsin (Ylongo by birth) succeeded to\r\nthe civil governorship, with a salary of $2,500 gold, by popular vote.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNotwithstanding the severities imposed on the Cebuanos during the\r\nlast eight months of Spanish rule, the Spaniards were able to evacuate\r\n_Cebu Island_ without menace or untoward event. For several months the\r\nGovernor, General Montero, had held in prison, between life and death,\r\na number of Filipinos of the best families, amongst whom was Julio\r\nLlorente, who afterwards became President of Cebu and subsequently\r\na magistrate of the Supreme Court of Manila. General Montero made\r\na compact with a young Philippine lawyer, Sergio Osmena (afterwards\r\nacting-Governor of Cebu) that in exchange for two Spaniards held as\r\nhostages in the interior he would release Llorente. Osmena procured the\r\nliberty of the Spaniards, but it was only on the eve of his departure\r\nthat Montero permitted the prison doors to be opened.\r\n\r\nOn December 26, 1898, a chartered merchant steamer called at Cebu\r\nto transport the retiring Spaniards to Zamboanga, the place of\r\nconcentration designated by General Rios. The farewell was sadly brief,\r\nand almost in silence the Governor handed over the government property\r\nto a most worthy and loyal Cebuano, Pablo Mejia, who was my esteemed\r\nfriend for many years. The Governor even offered Mejia about 40 rifles;\r\nbut Mejia, a lover of order, wrongly believing that a long period\r\nof tranquillity was about to set in, declined to accept them. And\r\nwithout any manifestation of regret on the part of the governed,\r\nthe last vestige of Spanish authority vanished from the city which,\r\n333 years before, was the capital of the Philippine Islands.\r\n\r\nOn the day following the departure of the Spaniards the Cebuanos\r\nestablished a provincial government in agreement with the _Katipunan_\r\nparty of Luzon, General Aguinaldo's direct representative being\r\nLuis Flores, the chief leader of the armed Cebuanos, to whom Pablo\r\nMejia handed over all that he had received from the ex-governor\r\nMontero. From its establishment up to the last day of its existence,\r\nthis government used the seal and stamps of the Philippine Republic,\r\nand was constituted as follows, viz.:--\r\n\r\n\r\n                _Provincial Council_\r\n\r\n    President and Commander-in-Chief    Luis Flores.\r\n    Vice-President                      Julio Llorente.\r\n    Commissioner of Police              Gen. Arcadio Maxilom.\r\n    Treasurer-General                   Pablo Mejia.\r\n    Minister of Justice                 Miguel Logarta.\r\n    Secretary to the Council            Leoncio Alburo.\r\n\r\n\r\n                _Military Department_\r\n\r\n    Chief-of-Staff                      Gen. Juan Climaco.\r\n    Military Administrator              Arsenio Climaco.\r\n                                        (Half-caste Chinese\r\n                                        and cousins.)\r\n\r\n\r\n                _Municipal Council (Junta Popular)_\r\n\r\n    Mayor                               Julio Llorente.\r\n    Councillors                         Several citizens elected\r\n                                        by popular vote.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe above constitution was in conformity with a decree of General\r\nAguinaldo dated June 18, 1898, and countersigned by Apolinario\r\nMabini. Local representatives of the provincial government were\r\nappointed throughout the Island for the collection of taxes and the\r\nmaintenance of order, and the system worked fairly smoothly until\r\nthe arrival of the Americans in Cebu City, February 21, 1899. On that\r\ndate the American gunboat _Petrel_ and a large steam-launch suddenly\r\nappeared in Cebu harbour. The United States Vice-Consul seems to have\r\nbeen the only person who had received prior advice of their intended\r\narrival. The commander of the _Petrel_ sent a message ashore saying\r\nthat he desired an interview with the government representatives\r\nand that he demanded the surrender of the city, and gave 14 hours\r\nto the people to consider his demands; but, as a matter of fact,\r\nthe negotiations lasted about 24 hours, during which time a council\r\nof Filipinos was hurriedly called to decide upon the course the\r\nprovincial government should adopt. Very divergent and extreme views\r\nwere expressed; Pablo Mejia, supported by Julio Llorente and Father\r\nJulia, advocated an acceptance of the inevitable under protest,\r\nwhilst General Gabino Sepulveda declared that he would spill his\r\nlast drop of blood before the Americans should take possession of\r\nthe city. But, in the end, Sepulveda reserved his blood for a better\r\noccasion, and eventually accepted employment under the Americans as\r\nprosecuting attorney in Bojol Island. Pablo Mejia's advice was acted\r\nupon, and in the name of the Cebuanos, Luis Flores, the President of\r\nthe Council, signed a protest [226] which was handed to the commander\r\nof the _Petrel_ by Pablo Mejia and Julio Llorente in the presence\r\nof the United States Vice-Consul. The commander of the _Petrel_\r\nforthwith landed 40 marines, who marched to the _Cotta de San Pedro_\r\n(the fortress) and hoisted the American flag there in the presence of\r\narmed Filipinos who looked on in silence. The marines then returned to\r\ntheir vessel, which remained inactive anchored off the _cotta_, pending\r\nthe arrival of reinforcements which were sent to Cebu under the command\r\nof Colonel Hamer. The provincial government was permitted to continue\r\nits functions and use its official seal, and during five months there\r\nwas no manifest anti-American movement. During this period the American\r\ncommander of the troops adopted tactics similar to those employed by\r\nGeneral E. S. Otis in Manila against Aguinaldo prior to the outbreak\r\nin February, 1899. Little by little the Americans required the armed\r\nFilipinos to retire farther and farther away from the capital. This\r\npractical isolation disgusted the several chiefs, who therefore agreed\r\nto open the campaign against the invaders. Every act of the provincial\r\ncouncillors was closely watched and discussed by the Cebuanos, amongst\r\nwhom an intransigent faction secretly charged Mejia and Llorente with\r\nbeing lukewarm in their protection of Philippine interests and unduly\r\nfavourable to American dominion. Their death was decreed, and Mejia was\r\nassassinated as he was passing to his house from that of a neighbour\r\na few yards off. Luis Flores had already resigned public office,\r\nand Llorente was, at this time, his successor in the presidency of\r\nthe Council. Fortunately for him, whilst the murderers were plotting\r\nagainst his life he was called to Manila by General E. S. Otis,\r\ntwo weeks after Mejia's death, to become a magistrate in the Supreme\r\nCourt. Segundo Singson (afterwards chief judge of the Court of First\r\nInstance) then assumed the presidency of the provincial council.\r\n\r\nOn July 24, 1899, Juan Climaco and Arcadio Maxilom, chafing at the\r\ndiminution of their influence in public affairs, suddenly disappeared\r\ninto the interior and met at Pardo, where the military revolutionary\r\ncentre was established. Aguinaldo's emissary, Pantaleon E. del\r\nRosario, Melquiades Lasala, a Cebuano of Bogo (known as Dading),\r\nAndres Jayme, Lorega, and an Ilocano named Mateo Luga who had served\r\nin the Spanish army, led contingents under the supreme command of the\r\ninsurgent General Arcadio Maxilom. In the interior they established\r\na fairly well-organized military government. The Island was divided\r\ninto districts; there was little interference with personal liberty;\r\ntaxes for the maintenance of the struggle were collected in the form of\r\ncontribution according to the means of the donor; agriculture was not\r\naltogether abandoned, and for over two years the insurgents held out\r\nagainst American rule. The brain of the movement was centred in Juan\r\nClimaco, whilst Mateo Luga exhibited the best fighting qualities. In\r\nthe meantime American troops were drafted to the coast towns of\r\nTuburan, Bogo, Carmen, etc. There were several severe engagements with\r\nslaughter on both sides, notably at Monte Sudlon and Compostela. Five\r\nwhite men joined the insurgent leader Luga, one being an English\r\nmercenary trooper, two sailors, and two soldiers; the last two were\r\ngiven up at the close of hostilities; one of them was pardoned, and\r\nthe other was executed in the _cotta_ for rape committed at Mandaue.\r\n\r\nThe co-existence of an American military administration in Cebu City\r\nconducting a war throughout the Island, and a Philippine provincial\r\ngovernment with nominal administrative powers over the same region,\r\nbut in strong sympathy with the insurgent cause, was no longer\r\ncompatible. Moreover, outside the city the provincial government was\r\nunable to enforce its decrees amongst the people, who recognized\r\nsolely the martial-law of the insurgents to whom they had to pay\r\ntaxes. The Americans therefore abolished the provincial council,\r\nwhich was not grieved at its dissolution, because it was already\r\naccused by the people of being pro-American. Philippine views of the\r\nsituation were expressed in a newspaper, _El Nuevo Dia_, founded by a\r\nlawyer, Rafael Palma, and edited conjointly by Jayme Veyra (afterwards\r\na candidate for the Leyte Island governorship) and an intelligent\r\nyoung lawyer, Sergio Osmena, already mentioned at p. 521. This organ,\r\nthe type and style of which favourably compared with any journal\r\never produced in these Islands, passed through many vicissitudes;\r\nit was alternately suppressed and revived, whilst its editors were\r\nthreatened with imprisonment in the _cotta_ and deportation to\r\nGuam. Meanwhile the Americans made strenuous efforts to secure the\r\nco-operation of the Filipinos in municipal administration, but the\r\npeople refused to vote. Leading citizens, cited to appear before\r\nthe American authorities, persistently declined to take any part in\r\na dual _regime_. The electors were then ordered, under penalties,\r\nto attend the polling, but out of the hundreds who responded to the\r\ncall only about 60 could be coerced into voting. Finally a packed\r\nmunicipal council was formed, but one of its members, a man hitherto\r\nhighly respected by all, was assassinated, and his colleagues went\r\nin fear of their lives.\r\n\r\nThe war in Panay Island having terminated on February 2, 1901,\r\nby the general surrender at Jaro (_vide_ p. 518), General Hughes\r\nwent to Samar Island, where he failed to restore peace, and thence\r\nhe proceeded to Cebu in the month of August at the head of 2,000\r\ntroops. A vigorous policy of devastation was adopted. Towns, villages\r\nand crops were laid waste; Pardo, the insurgent military centre,\r\nwas totally destroyed; peaceful natives who had compulsorily paid\r\ntribute to the insurgents at whose mercy they were obliged to live,\r\nwere treated as enemies; their homes and means of livelihood were\r\ndemolished, and little distinction was made between the warrior and\r\nthe victim of the war. Desolation stared the people in the face,\r\nand within a few weeks the native provincial governor proposed\r\nthat terms of peace should be discussed. The insurgent chief Lorega\r\nsurrendered on October 22; Mateo Luga and Arcadio Maxilom submitted\r\nfive days afterwards and at the end of the month a general cessation\r\nof hostilities followed. A neutral zone was agreed upon, extending\r\nfrom Mandaue to Sogod, and there the three peace commissioners on\r\nbehalf of the Americans, namely Miguel Logarta, Pedro Rodriguez,\r\nand Arsenio Climaco met the insurgent chiefs Juan Climaco and Arcadio\r\nMaxilom. As a result, peace was signed, and the document includes the\r\nfollowing significant words, viz.: \"putting the Philippine people in\r\na condition to prove their aptitude for self-government as the basis\r\nof a future independent life.\" The signatories of this document on the\r\npart of the Filipinos were Pantaleon E. del Rosario, Melquiades Lasala\r\nand Andres Jayme. After the peace, Mateo Luga and P. E. del Rosario\r\naccepted employment under the Americans, the former as Inspector of\r\nConstabulary and the latter as Sheriff of Cebu. A few months later,\r\nthe Americans, acting on information received, proceeded to Tuburan\r\non the government launch _Philadelphia_, arrested Arcadio Maxilom and\r\nhis two brothers, and seized the arms which they had secreted on their\r\nproperty. On the launch, one of the Maxiloms unsuccessfully attempted\r\nto murder the Americans and was immediately executed, whilst Arcadio\r\nand his other brother jumped overboard; but Arcadio being unable to\r\nswim, was picked up, brought to trial at Cebu, and acquitted. Thus\r\nended the career of General Arcadio Maxilom, whom in 1904 I found\r\nliving in retirement, almost a hermit's life, broken in spirit and\r\nbody and worried by numerous lawsuits pending against him.\r\n\r\nOn April 17,1901, Governor W. H. Taft went to Cebu accompanied by a\r\nFilipino, H. Pardo de Tavera, whose views were diametrically opposed\r\nto those of the Cebuano majority. Governor Taft established civil\r\ngovernment there, although the law of _habeas corpus_ had to be\r\nsuspended because the war was still raging throughout the Island\r\noutside the capital. The provincial government as established\r\nby Governor Taft comprises a provincial board composed of three\r\nmembers, namely the Philippine Provincial Governor, the American\r\nSupervisor, and the American Treasurer: hence the Americans are in\r\npermanent majority and practically rule the Island. The executive\r\nof this body is the provincial governor and his staff. The first\r\nprovincial governor appointed by Governor Taft was Julio Llorente,\r\nwho resigned the magistracy in Manila and returned to Cebu to take\r\nup his new office until the elections took place in January, 1902,\r\nwhen, by popular vote, Juan Climaco, the ex-insurgent chief, became\r\nprovincial governor, and on the expiration of his term in January,\r\n1904, he was re-elected for another two years.\r\n\r\nThere is no noteworthy change in the aspect of Cebu since the American\r\noccupation. It is a regularly-built city, with hundreds of good houses,\r\nmany relatively imposing public buildings, monuments, churches, and\r\ninteresting edifices. It is a cathedral city and bishop's see, full of\r\nhistorical remininscences, and has still a very pleasant appearance,\r\nnotwithstanding its partial destruction and the many remaining\r\nruins caused by the bombardment by the Spanish warship _Don Juan de\r\nAustria_ in April 1838, (_vide_ p. 403). Of special interest are the\r\nCathedral, the Church of _Santo Nino_, or the \"Holy Child of Cebu\"\r\n(_vide_ p. 183), the Chapels of the Paul Fathers and of the Jesuits,\r\nand the _Cotta de San Pedro_ (fortress). Also, just outside the city\r\nproper is the Church of _San Nicolas_. Up to about the year 1876 the\r\nJesuits had a fine church of their own, but the friars, jealous of\r\nits having become the most popular place of worship, caused it to be\r\ndestroyed. Until a few years ago the quarter known as the, _Parian_\r\nwas the flourishing centre of the half-caste traders. There was also a\r\nbusy street of Chinese general shops and native ready-made clothiers in\r\nthe _Lutao_ district, a thoroughfare which ran along the seashore from\r\nthe south of the city proper towards San Nicolas; it was completely\r\ndestroyed by the bombardment of 1898, and many of the shopkeepers have\r\nerected new premises in the principal shopping street, called _Calle de\r\nla Infanta_. Again, in 1905, a disastrous fire in the business quarter\r\nof the city caused damage to the estimated extent of $500,000 gold.\r\n\r\nThere is a little colony of foreign merchants in Cebu, which formerly\r\nranked as the third port of the Archipelago, but now stands second in\r\nimportance to Manila (_vide_ Trade Statistics, Chap. xxxi.). Several\r\nvice-consulates are established here, and in Spanish times it was\r\nthe residence of the military governor of Visayas as well as of the\r\ngovernor of the Island and his staff of officials. In 1886 a Supreme\r\nCourt was inaugurated in Cebu. This city, which was the capital of\r\nthe Colony from 1565 to 1571, had a municipality up to the time of\r\nGov.-General Pedro de Arandia (1754-59). It was then abolished because\r\nthere was only one Spaniard capable of being a city councillor. One\r\nalderman who had served--Juan Sebastian de Espina--could neither\r\nread nor write, and the mayor himself had been deprived of office\r\nfor having tried to extort money from a Chinaman by putting his head\r\nin the stocks. By Royal Order dated June 7, 1889, and put into force\r\nby the Gov.-General's Decree of January 31, 1890, the municipality\r\nwas re-established. The president was the governor of the Island,\r\nsupported by an _Alcalde_ and 13 officials. For the government of\r\nthe Island under the Spanish _regime, vide_ Chap. xiii.\r\n\r\nThe municipality at present existing is that established by the\r\nTaft Commission. The Press, in the days of the Spaniards, was poorly\r\nrepresented by a little news-sheet, styled the _Boletin de Cebu_. There\r\nare now two periodicals of little or no interest.\r\n\r\nThere are two large cemeteries at Guadalupe and Mabolo. In 1887 a\r\nshooting-butts was established at the end of the Guadalupe road,\r\nand the annual pony-races take place in January. On the Mabolo road\r\nthere is a Leper Hospital, and the ruins of a partly well-built jail\r\nwhich was never completed.\r\n\r\nCebu is a port of entry open to foreign trade, with a Custom-house\r\nestablished since the year 1863. The channel for vessels is marked by\r\nbuoys, and there are two lighthouses at the north and two at the south\r\nentrance to the port. The environs are pretty, with Magtan Island\r\n(on which Maghallanes was killed) in front and a range of hills in\r\nthe background. There are excellent roads for riding and driving a\r\nfew miles out of the city. The climate is very healthy for Europeans;\r\nthe low ranges of mountains running north to south of the Island are\r\nsparsely wooded, some being quite bare of trees, and the atmosphere is\r\ncomparatively dry. The cactus is very common all over the Island, and\r\nmiles of it are seen growing in the hedges. About an hour and a half's\r\ndrive from Cebu City there is the little town of Naga, the environs\r\nof which are extremely pretty. From the top of Makdoc Mountain,\r\nat the back of the town, there is a splendid view of the Pandan Valley.\r\n\r\nThe Cebuanos are the most sociable of the Visaya population, whilst\r\nthe women are the best-looking of all the Filipinas of pure Oriental\r\ndescent.\r\n\r\nOf all places in the Philippines Cebu will please the conchologist. An\r\nold native named Legaspi once had a splendid shell collection, which he\r\nfreely exhibited to foreigners. At one time he had a _Gloria Maris_,\r\nwhich he sold for $150, and some Russian naval officers are said\r\nto have offered him $5,000 for a part of his collection. At certain\r\nseasons of the year the _Euplectella speciosa_, Gray, or Venus baskets,\r\nlocally known as _Regaderas_, can be obtained in quantities; they are\r\nfound in the Cebu waters. The _Eup. spec_, is the skeleton secretion of\r\nan insect of the Porifera division. The basket is a series of graceful\r\nfretted spirals. Also fine _Pina_ stuffs can be purchased here.\r\n\r\nThe population of Cebu City was 9,629 in 1888; 10,972 in 1896; and\r\n18,330 in 1903. The inhabitants of the whole Island numbered 417,543\r\nin 1876; 518,032 in 1888; 595,726 in 1896; and 653,727 in 1903.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIn March, 1899, an American armed force was detailed from Cebu City\r\nto _Bojol Island_ to demand the surrender of the native provincial\r\ngovernment established there since the Spanish evacuation. Interpreters\r\nfrom Cebu were sent ashore, and after hearing their explanation of the\r\nAmericans demands the native president in council resolved to yield\r\npeacefully. A volunteer regiment was then sent ashore, positions were\r\noccupied, and all went smoothly on the surface until the Islanders'\r\npowers of endurance were exhausted after 22 months of alleged harsh\r\ntreatment imposed upon them by the troops. In January, 1901, the cry\r\nof rebellion was raised by one Pedro Sanson, whose band of Bojolanos,\r\naugmented by levies from Leyte, Samar, and Panay Islands numbered\r\nabout 2,000. Expeditions were sent out against them, and the lukewarm\r\nsympathy of the Islanders was turned to general indignation against the\r\nAmericans by the alleged wanton destruction of a whole town by fire, by\r\norder of a captain of volunteers. Practically the whole Island became\r\ncovertly anti-American. Having finished his campaign in Cebu Island in\r\nOctober, 1901, General Hughes carried his troops over to Bojol Island,\r\nwhere measures of repression were adopted similar to those which had\r\nbeen so effective in reducing the Cebuanos to submission. A large\r\nnumber of small towns and villages within the range of military\r\noperations were entirely destroyed. The once pretty little town\r\nof Lauang was left a complete ruin, and many landmarks of a former\r\nprogressive civilization have disappeared for ever. Nevertheless, the\r\ninsurgents refused to yield until a decree was issued to the effect\r\nthat if the leaders did not surrender by December 27 the invaders\r\nwould burn down the town of Tagbilaran. In this town, formerly the\r\nseat of the native provincial government, Pedro Sanson and most of his\r\nofficers had all their property and worldly possessions; and in view\r\nof the beggary which awaited them if they held out any longer, they\r\naccepted terms of peace from Pantaleon E. del Rosario, who went up to\r\nthe mountains and acted as negotiator between General Hughes and the\r\ninsurgent chiefs who finally surrendered. The Filipino, Aniceto Clarin,\r\nappointed provincial governor on April 20, 1901, continued in office;\r\nPedro Sanson quietly resumed his occupation of dealer in hemp, etc.,\r\nand thenceforth peace and poverty reigned in the Island.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIn _Cottabato_ (Mindanao Is.), the attempt to establish a local native\r\ngovernment ended in tragic failure. In January, 1899, a Spanish\r\ngunboat silently entered the port without the customary whistling\r\nand firing of salute. It brought a despatch to the Governor from the\r\nnominal acting-Gov.-General Rios, who, coming from Yloilo, called at\r\nZamboanga before proceeding to Manila, to receive on board a number of\r\nSpanish refugees. One of the crew of the gunboat also brought a private\r\ncommunication from the Jesuit Superior in Zamboanga to the Jesuit\r\nmissionary Father Suarez. The official despatch notified the Governor\r\nthat the Treaty of Paris had been signed, and consequently he was to\r\nevacuate Cottabato immediately. The private communication told the\r\nsame tale to the missionary, with an inquiry from the Jesuit Superior\r\nas to whether he could continue his mission after the withdrawal of\r\nthe Spanish Governor, and whether it would be of any advantage to do\r\nso. The Governor informed the missionary of his intended departure,\r\nand the missionary replied negatively to his superior in Zamboanga. The\r\nGovernor then called Roman Vilo, his confidential christian native\r\nassistant, and told him that he and all who had been loyal to the\r\nSpanish Government and faithful in their service could take passage\r\nto Zamboanga. Vilo, however, for himself and his family, declined\r\nthe offer on the ground that all his interests were in and about\r\nCottabato, where he possessed real estate. The Governor then had the\r\nMoro-Chinese half-caste Datto Piang called, and in the presence of\r\nVilo the former was appointed chief of the Moro people and the latter\r\ngovernor of the christian population. After making a short speech,\r\nexhorting the two chiefs, in benevolent phrases, to live in peace\r\nand act mutually for the common good, the Governor, accompanied by\r\nthe Jesuit missionaries and others who were desirous of leaving the\r\nplace, went to Zamboanga on the gunboat.\r\n\r\nWhen, after the lapse of some weeks, Datto Piang felt sure that\r\nthe Spaniards would never be again in authority at Cottabato, he\r\nbegged Vilo to let him have twenty rifles to defend himself against a\r\nrival. The christian governor agreed to this, and week by week Datto\r\nPiang's demands grew until, at length, all the rifles in the possession\r\nof the Christians passed to the Moros. But there still remained some\r\ncannons, and Datto Piang, having represented the necessity of making\r\nwar on another chief up the Cottabato River, Vilo was persuaded to\r\nlend them to him. Piang had them placed in _vintas_ (war-junks) and\r\nVilo, with several friends, went down to the river-side to witness\r\nthe departure of the supposed armed expedition. Suddenly Piang, his\r\nson-in-law Datto Ali and this man's brother, Datto Djimbangan, at the\r\nhead of a large party of armed Moros, fell upon and slaughtered the\r\nChristians. Vilo's head was cut off and the savage Mahometans made a\r\nraid on the town, looting all but the shops of the Chinese who were in\r\nleague, or accord, with their half-countryman Piang. The Christians who\r\nwere unable to escape were either massacred or carried off as slaves\r\ninto the interior, with the loot. Datto Djimbangan caused the Christian\r\nwomen to be stripped naked and marched through the streets, whilst he\r\nand his companions made their selections for themselves, leaving the\r\nremainder for their followers. Amongst the captives were a father and\r\ntwo sons. In October, 1899, the Americans sent a gunboat to Cottabato,\r\nand the wife of this captive, mother of his two boys, represented her\r\nplight to the commander, who forthwith sent for Piang and ordered him\r\nimmediately to send a message to the individual holding the captives\r\nto release them and hand them over to the messenger, who would conduct\r\nthem back to Cottabato. Piang, without a moment's hesitation, offered\r\nto comply, and sent a _vinta_ up the river with the required order,\r\nbut at the same time he secretly sent another emissary overland with\r\ncontrary instructions. The land messenger, as was expected, arrived\r\nfirst, and when the _vinta_ party reached the place of captivity,\r\nPiang's people expressed their regret that they could not oblige the\r\nparty because they had just cut off the captives' heads. In 1904 a\r\nmember of the victims' family was a teacher in the Jesuits' Catholic\r\nSchool in Zamboanga. Datto Piang, who owes his position and influence\r\nover the Moros to the protection of the late great Datto Utto (_vide_\r\np. 143) is the father-in-law of the terrible Datto Ali whose continual\r\ndepredations and defiance made Cottabato the centre of that unabated\r\nconflict for the Americans described in Chapter xxix.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the belief that the Zamboanguenos were loyally disposed towards\r\nSpain, the Spaniards, after the signing of the Treaty of Paris, chose\r\n_Zamboanga_ (Mindanao Is.) as their point of concentration of all the\r\nSpanish troops and civil servants in the southern islands. At that time\r\nGeneral Jaramillo was Gov.-General of Mindanao Island and commander of\r\nthe forces in Zamboanga; but on the arrival there, December 27, 1898,\r\nof the ex-governor of Cebu, General Montero, with his co-refugees,\r\nGeneral Jaramillo transferred his command to him and left for Manila\r\nwith General Rios, who had come from Yloilo to Zamboanga to receive\r\nrefugee passengers for the capital. Before his departure Jaramillo\r\nhad led the Zamboangueno Christians to believe that the war with\r\nAmerica was, at every turn, a triumphant success for Spanish arms;\r\nfictitious printed telegrams were circulated announcing Spanish\r\nvictories everywhere, and one of the most extravagant reported that\r\nGeneral Weyler had landed on American soil at Key West with an army of\r\n80,000 Spanish troops. The motive of this harmless ruse was to bolster\r\nup Spanish prestige and thereby avoid bloodshed. During several months\r\nno trading or mail-steamer came, and the Zamboanguenos were practically\r\ncut off from the rest of the world. Military preparations were made\r\nfor the feigned purpose of resisting a possible attack on the place\r\nby the Americans, who were described to the people as cannibals and\r\nferocious monsters more terrible than the dreaded Moros. Naturally\r\nthe real object of the military preparations was the Spaniards'\r\njustifiable endeavour to be ready to defend themselves against open\r\nrebellion when the true situation should ooze out. Nor was their\r\nmisrepresentation of the Americans mere spiteful calumny; the Spaniards\r\nwere in great jeopardy, and they instinctively wished to destroy any\r\nfeeling of welcome which the natives might have for the new-comers\r\nfor fear it might operate against themselves at the supreme moment of\r\ndanger. Indeed, each party--native and Spanish--was seeking to outwit\r\nthe other; hence, when the Zamboanguenos were promised a supply of arms\r\nfor the ostensible purpose of resisting invasion, they pretended to\r\nco-operate heartily with the Spaniards' defensive measures, with the\r\nsecret design of dispossessing the Spaniards of their arms in order to\r\nuse them against them. The Zamboanguenos therefore became so persistent\r\nin their demand upon Montero to fulfil his predecessor's promise\r\nthat at last he had frankly to confess that peace had been signed\r\nbetween Spain and America, whereby the Islands were surrendered to the\r\nUnited States, and that very shortly the Spaniards would evacuate the\r\nArchipelago. But the conflicting versions of the situation, published\r\nseverally by Jaramillo and Montero, sorely puzzled the natives. The\r\nSpaniards were still in undisturbed possession of Zamboanga for over\r\nfour months after Montero's arrival, notwithstanding the fact that\r\nthe American warship _Boston_ called at the port and left the same\r\nday and that an officer came ashore without the least objection\r\nor consternation on the part of the Spaniards. The orange-and-red\r\nflag still floated over the Fortress del Pilar, and, so far as the\r\nZamboanguenos could ascertain, it looked as if the Spaniards were\r\ngoing to remain. They therefore clamoured more loudly than ever for\r\nthe distribution of arms, which this time Montero positively refused,\r\nfor the Spaniards had never for a moment been deceived as to the real\r\nintentions of the Zamboanguenos. On the other hand, by this time,\r\ntheir inoffensive delusion of the people had lost its virtue, and\r\nnatives and Spaniards thenceforth became open enemies. After the\r\nvisit of the _Boston_ the fighting population, no longer able to\r\nconceal their disappointment, threw off the mask, quitted the town,\r\ncut off the water-supply which came from the mountains, in collusion\r\nwith the mutinied crews seized the firearms on board the Spanish\r\ngunboats lying in the harbour, and prepared for war against their\r\nold masters. The Spaniards immediately compelled the non-combatant\r\ntownspeople and the Chinese to throw up earthworks for mounting\r\nartillery and dig trenches for defence against the rebels. The gunboat\r\n_Alava_ co-operated by firing shells into the rebel camp situated\r\njust outside the town. The rebels made two unsuccessful assaults,\r\nand in the second attack General Montero was mortally wounded by a\r\nrifle-shot. On May 23 the S.S. _Leon XIII._ arrived; the Spaniards\r\nsilently embarked for Manila with their dying general, who succumbed\r\nduring the voyage, and Zamboanga, one-fourth of which the defenders\r\nhad destroyed by fire, was occupied by the rebels. During the siege\r\nthe Filipinos, true to their instincts, had split up into two rival\r\nfactions headed by Vicente Alvarez and Isidoro Midel respectively,\r\nand in the interval between the first and second assault on the town\r\nthese party chiefs had fought out their own quarrel, Midel claiming to\r\nhave been the victor. Nevertheless, the popular favourite was Vicente\r\nAlvarez, known as the _Tamagun Datto_ (high chief), who became the\r\nchosen president of the Zamboanga revolutionary government established\r\nimmediately after the Spanish evacuation. Party spirit ran high;\r\nlife was held in little esteem; a lifeless body found on the highway\r\nstartled no one; assassination was an occurrence of small moment;\r\ncattle-shooting was practised for amusement, and the five-and-a-half\r\nmonths' essay of christian Philippine autonomy was so signalized by\r\njealous self-interest, bitter rivalry, rapacity, and bloodshed as to\r\nmake one doubt whether the christian Zamboangueno is one whit superior\r\nto his Mahometan neighbour in moral character.\r\n\r\nThe arrival of an American expedition in the waters of Zamboanga\r\non November 15, 1899, produced a sanguinary crisis in these faction\r\nfeuds. Vicente Alvarez at once took measures to oppose the invaders'\r\nlanding, whilst his rival, Isidoro Midel, resolved to side with\r\nthe Americans. _Divide et impera._ The want of unity amongst the\r\nnatives themselves was a great help to the Americans' plans. By this\r\ntime there appeared a third aspirant to local fame in the person of\r\nMelanio Sanson, a native marine engineer, until recently in the Spanish\r\nservice, who pretended to co-operate with Alvarez, styling himself\r\ncolonel of artillery in charge of the guns abandoned by his former\r\nmasters. Each of these three individuals sought to rid himself of his\r\ntwo rivals. On the night of November 15 Isidoro Midel ended Melanio\r\nSanson's rivalry for ever, and the Americans took peaceful possession\r\nof the town the next day. Subsequently Midel arranged a transfer\r\nto the Americans of the artillery which had, during the conflict,\r\nbeen under Sanson's control. Vicente Alvarez immediately fled to\r\nMercedes, and thence to Basilan Island, where, aided by Datto Pedro\r\nCuevas, he organized a brigand band, crossed over to Mindanao Island\r\nagain, and made a raid on Oriquieta. Chased from place to place by\r\nAmerican troops, he was finally captured and sent to Bilibid prison\r\nin Manila, but was subsequently pardoned on his taking the oath of\r\nallegiance, and sent back to Zamboanga, where he earns his living\r\npeacefully. Meanwhile, Isidoro Midel had been further rewarded for his\r\nservices to the Americans with the office of municipal president, which\r\nhe held for about 16 months in defiance of public opinion. The feeling\r\nwhich prompted public opposition to Midel's appointment was at least\r\nas much anti-American as it was dislike for the nominee. In March,\r\n1901, municipal elections were held, and Mariano Arquiza succeeded,\r\nby popular vote, to the presidency, which he held for two years. Some\r\nweeks before Arquiza vacated office two American miners were murdered\r\nby the natives a few miles up the province. The murderers, when caught,\r\nsought to justify their deed by alleging that a municipal councillor\r\nnamed Eduardo Alvarez (no relation to the Vicente Alvarez already\r\nmentioned) had persuaded them that the miners were secretly engaged in\r\npoisoning the local wells. The whole municipal council was therefore\r\ncited to appear before the American Governor, who severely reprimanded\r\nAlvarez, whereupon this man withdrew from the audience-chamber, and\r\nhis fellow-councillors volunteered such information against him that\r\nthe Governor instantly issued a warrant for his apprehension. But the\r\nnative police who went to his house to execute the warrant let him\r\nescape on horseback to the mountains, where he organized a band of\r\noutlaws and lived for about four months by robbery and violence. Under\r\nthese circumstances the American Governor summarily dismissed Mariano\r\nArquiza from the municipal presidency in the spring of 1903, and, much\r\nto the public chagrin, re-appointed Midel to the vacancy. The offer of\r\n$1,000 for the capture of Eduardo Alvarez spurred Midel into further\r\nactivity, and under his direction the bandit was discovered hiding\r\nin a canoe in a swamp. On the approach of his pursuers the outlaw\r\nthrew up his hands in sign of surrender, which was responded to by\r\na volley of gunshots, for it was Alvarez's corpse which was wanted\r\nin Zamboanga. Isidoro Midel is an interesting character, apparently\r\nabout forty-eight years of age. Brought up as a Roman Catholic, he\r\nassured me that he was a Protestant, with the strongest sympathy,\r\nhowever, for the Aglipayan movement (_vide_ Chap. xxx.).\r\n\r\nAnother interesting man, closely associated with recent events in\r\nZamboanga, is the Mahometan Spanish-Moro half-caste Datto Mandi, the\r\n_Rajahmudah_ or heir-apparent to the _Manguiguin_ or Sultan of Mindanao\r\n(_vide_ p. 131). Born about the year 1860, he and his tribe of Samals\r\nlived on friendly terms with the Spaniards, who in 1887 sent him and\r\na number of his people to the Philippine Exhibition held in Madrid in\r\nthat year. His exploits in aid of the Spaniards in Cebu are recorded at\r\npage 406. He speaks Spanish fluently, and can just write his name. He\r\nis very affable and hospitable to visitors. The whole family professes\r\nthe Mahometan religion. He has a beautiful daughter Gafas (which\r\nin Moro language signifies \"cotton,\" and in Spanish \"spectacles\"),\r\nwho attended the American School. His young son Facundo also goes to\r\nthe American School, and his other son Pelayo went to the Catholic\r\nSchool in Zamboanga before he was sent to Manila. I was much struck\r\nwith the intelligence of this handsome boy Pelayo. In the stirring\r\nevents which immediately followed the Spanish evacuation, Datto Mandi\r\nremained neutral, his old antagonism to Alvarez being counterpoised by\r\nthe conviction that a Zamboanga republic must end in a fiasco. He at\r\nonce accepted the new situation under American dominion, and is headman\r\nof the Samal tribal ward of Magay, a suburb of Zamboanga. He told me\r\nin 1904 that he held under his control 9,600 persons, from 1,700 of\r\nwhom he collected capitation tax for the American authorities. At\r\nthe instance of the Americans, Datto Mandi issued a proclamation\r\nto his tribe, dated April 19, 1900, abolishing their traditional\r\ncustom of slavery. His position is not at all an easy one, and it\r\nneeds much tact to maintain an even balance of goodwill between his\r\nSamal subordinates and his American superiors. But Datto Mandi had a\r\ngrievance which rankled in his breast. In the year 1868 the Spanish\r\nGovernment conceded to a christian native family named Fuentebella\r\nsome 600 acres of land at Buluan, about 40 miles up the Zamboanga\r\ncoast, which in time they converted into a prosperous plantation well\r\nstocked with cattle. During the anarchy which succeeded the Spanish\r\nevacuation, a band of about 600 Moros raided the property, murdered\r\nseven of the christian residents, and stole all they could possibly\r\ncarry away from the plantation and well-furnished estate-house. When\r\nDatto Mandi heard of it he went there in person and rescued the\r\nwomen held in captivity and brought them to Zamboanga, where they\r\nlived in perfect security under his protection until the American\r\nadvent. Then, in return for his kindness, these women accused the\r\n_Datto_ of having been the instigator of the crime, or, at least,\r\na participator in the proceeds thereof, in the hope that, through\r\nthe Americans, they would be able to exact an indemnity. The _Datto_\r\nwas mulcted in the sum of 5,000 pesos, although he declared to me that\r\nneither before nor after the crime was he in any way concerned in it;\r\nand this was the honest belief of many American officials in Zamboanga.\r\n\r\nIn January, 1905, Datto Mandi's daughter was married at a little town\r\na few miles from Yligan (north Mindanao). Several American officers\r\nwere present on the occasion, accompanied by a Spanish half-caste\r\nwho acted as their interpreter. The assembled guests were having\r\na merry time when suddenly the festivities were interrupted by the\r\nintrusion of a _juramentado_ Moro fanatic, who sprang forward with\r\nhis _campilan_ and at one blow almost severed the interpreter's head\r\nfrom his body. Then he turned his attention to the other natives,\r\nmortally wounded two, and cut gashes in several others before he fell\r\ndead from the revolver-shots fired by the American officers. After\r\nthe dead and wounded were carried away and the pools of blood were\r\nmopped up, the wedding ceremony was proceeded with and the hymeneal\r\nfestival was resumed without further untoward incident.\r\n\r\nZamboanga is a clean, pleasant town, and what was left of it\r\nafter the Spanish evacution is well built, with many substantial\r\nhouses and public offices, a church administered by the Jesuits,\r\none large and one small jetty, a pretty esplanade facing the sea,\r\nand other open spaces. A canal running through the town adds to\r\nits picturesqueness. At the eastern extremity is the old fortress,\r\ncalled the _Fuerza del Pilar_, a fine historical monument reminding\r\none of the Spaniards' many vicissitudes in this region, alluded to\r\nin the preceding pages. Many of the natives concerned, or alleged to\r\nhave been concerned, in the Cavite Rising of 1872 (_vide_ p. 106)\r\nwere confined in this fortress. They overcame their jailors and\r\nobtained possession of the guns and ammunition. The Spaniards were\r\nconsequently in great straits, for possibly their existence depended\r\non which side the townspeople took. The Zamboanguenos, however, helped\r\nthe Spaniards against the revolted convicts, who were finally subdued;\r\nand as a reward for this proof of loyalty Zamboanga received the title\r\nof _Muy leal y valiente Villa_ (very loyal and heroic town). Many years\r\nago a Moro attack was made on Zamboanga, and the Christian natives\r\njoined with the Spaniards in repelling it. It would have gone rather\r\nbadly with them if they had not done so, for a Philippine Christian\r\nwas just as good fish for the Moro net as a Spaniard. However, their\r\nco-operation was gratefully acknowledged by declaring the Zamboanguenos\r\nto be Spaniards of the first class.\r\n\r\nI have never been able to discern clearly what material advantage\r\nthis brought them, although I have discussed the question on the\r\nspot. The disadvantage of this pompous distinction to the town arose\r\nfrom the ridiculous popular notion that whereas Spaniards in Spain\r\nare all cavaliers, they too, as Spaniards of the first water, ought to\r\nregard work as a degradation. Hence they are a remarkably indolent and\r\neffete community, and on landing from a ship there is seldom a porter\r\nto be seen to carry one's luggage. Their speech is a dialect called\r\n_Chabucano_--a mixture of very corrupt Spanish and native tongues.\r\n\r\nThe environment of Zamboanga is very beautiful, with islands to the\r\nsouth and mountain scenery on the land sides. The climate is healthy,\r\nand with the frequent delightful breezes wafted across the Celebes\r\nSea is not at all oppressive for a tropical region, and is cooler\r\nthan Manila, which is 425 miles north.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe people of _Samar Island_ for a long time tenaciously opposed\r\nthe American occupation, under several leaders, notably Vicente\r\nLucban and his right-hand man, Guevara; but neither here, nor in\r\n_Marinduque Island_ can it be said that native civil government was\r\nestablished. In the latter Island the insurgent chief was the titular\r\nColonel Abad, who overran the villages with about 150 followers\r\narmed with rifles. In 1901 Abad surrendered, and hostilities, with\r\nreal political aim, definitely ended in these Islands thirteen months\r\nafter the capture of Aguinaldo in Luzon. Although in Samar Island the\r\nwar was, as elsewhere, a succession of petty encounters, there were\r\nincidents in its prosecution which attracted much public attention\r\nfrom time to time. At the town of Balangiga, on September 28, 1901,\r\nthe local headman and the native parish priest conspired with about\r\n450 armed natives to attack the American camp. The garrison stationed\r\nthere was Company \"C,\" 9th Infantry. The headman had represented to\r\nthe Americans that he was busy with an important capture of about 90\r\nbrigands, and on this pretext some 45 cut-throats were brought into\r\nthe town and lodged in the church. Three officers of the garrison were\r\nquartered in the parish-house, and whilst the rank-and-file were at\r\nbreakfast in a bamboo building, some distance away from their quarters\r\nwhere they had left their weapons, another 45 supposed brigands were\r\nled through the town to the church, but naturally the soldiers took\r\nlittle notice of this expected event. The town is surrounded on one\r\nside by the open valley and on three sides by almost perpendicular\r\nmountains, with defiles between them leading to the interior of the\r\nIsland. As soon as the last batch of supposed brigands was brought\r\nin, the church bells were rung as a signal for a mob of natives,\r\narmed with bowie-knives, to creep silently through the defiles on two\r\nsides. The troopers were just then suddenly alarmed by the noise of a\r\nconflict in the parish-house. The 90 so-called brigands having been\r\npassed through from the church into this house, fired at the three\r\nofficers and then killed them with their bowie-knives. Simultaneously\r\nthe soldiers' quarters were attacked. Whilst the troops made a rush\r\nforward to secure their weapons they were intercepted by an armed\r\ncrowd, through which a small party of Americans finally cut their\r\nway and beat off the howling mob, which had already slaughtered many\r\nsoldiers, set fire to the quarters, and possessed themselves of over\r\n50 rifles and several thousand rounds of ammunition. A large number\r\nof hostile natives, including the headman, were killed; 28 Americans\r\neffected their escape, but the loss amounted to three officers and\r\nabout 70 men killed and several more men wounded. General Hughes, in\r\ncommand of the Visayas District, was operating in Cebu Island at the\r\ntime of this disaster. Public excitement was intense when the news\r\nof this serious reverse was published. The general who was sent to\r\nSamar to pursue the insurgents, or bandits, is alleged to have issued,\r\nin a moment of uncontrollable wrath, an order to \"slay all over ten\r\nyears and make Samar a howling wilderness.\" Consequently a great\r\ncry of public protest was raised, and the general and his executive\r\nofficer in the affair were cited before a court-martial in April,\r\n1902; but the court having found that the general was justified in\r\nthe measures he took, both officers were acquitted. Since the capture\r\nof Lucban (April 27, 1902), lawless agitation has been persistently\r\nrife all over the Island of Samar; but this is the work of brigands\r\n(_vide_ p. 551) and has no political signification.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXVI\r\n\r\nThe Spanish Prisoners\r\n\r\n\r\nExtreme interest was naturally taken by all Europeans in the miserable\r\nfate of the thousands of Spanish soldiers and civilians who had fallen\r\ninto the rebels hands up to the capitulation of Manila. [227] Held\r\ncaptive in groups at different places in the Island of Luzon, many of\r\nthem passed a wretched existence, with bad food, scant clothing, and\r\ndeprived of every pleasure in life beyond the hope of one day seeing\r\ntheir native land. Many of them died, either from natural causes or\r\nthe effect of their privations (some of starvation in Tayabas), or\r\nas a result of brutal treatment. A minority of them received as good\r\ntreatment as possible under the circumstances. The fate of the majority\r\ndepended chiefly upon the temperament of the native commander of the\r\ndistrict. There were semi-savage native chiefs, and there were others,\r\nlike Aguinaldo himself, with humane instincts. Amongst the former,\r\nfor instance, there was Major Francisco Braganza, who, on February\r\n28, 1900, in Camarines Sur, ordered one hundred and three Spanish\r\nsoldiers to be tied up to trees and cut and stabbed to death with\r\nbowie-knifes and their bodies stripped and left without burial. He\r\nwas tried by court-martial and sentenced to be hanged, September 26,\r\n1901, and the sentence was carried out at Nueva Caceres (Camarines\r\nSur) on November 15 following. Many prisoners managed to escape, no\r\ndoubt with the aid or connivance of natives, until Aguinaldo issued a\r\ndecree, dated Malolos, November 5, 1898, imposing a penalty of twenty\r\nyears' imprisonment on whomsoever should give such aid. Aguinaldo\r\ntold me he was personally inclined to liberate these prisoners, or,\r\nat least, those civilians accustomed to an easy office life who,\r\nif they went free, would have had no inclination whatever to fight,\r\nbut would have done their best to embark for Spain. The few who might\r\nhave broken their _parole_ would have been easily caught again \"for\r\nthe last time in their lives,\" and the women and children were an\r\nobstacle to military operations. Indeed, from time to time, Aguinaldo\r\ndid liberate small groups of civilians, amongst whom were some of\r\nmy old friends whom I afterwards met in Spain. Aguinaldo's Prime\r\nMinister, Apolinario Mabini (_vide_ p. 546), was, however, strongly\r\nin favour of retaining the Spaniards as hostages until the Spanish\r\nGovernment should officially recognize the Philippine Republic. It\r\nwill be clearly seen from the negotiations entered into between the\r\nrespective parties that this recognition was the condition which\r\nthe rebels most pertinaciously insisted upon, whilst the Spaniards'\r\noffers of millions of dollars were always met by much larger demands,\r\nwhich practically implied a refusal to treat on a money basis. The\r\nfacts in the negotiations certainly support Aguinaldo's statement\r\nto me that the rebels never sought money, but political advantage,\r\nby the retention of the prisoners.\r\n\r\nThe intense excitement in Spain over the prisoners' doom called into\r\nexistence meetings, liberation societies, frequent discussions in\r\nand out of Parliament, and continual protests against the apparent\r\nMinisterial lethargy. In reality, the Spanish Government, fearful of\r\na rupture with America, could take no official action in the matter,\r\nfurther than appeal, indirectly, to the generosity of the captors, and\r\nremind America of her undertaking under Article 6 of the treaty. In\r\nJanuary, 1899, the Colonial Minister cabled to several people in\r\nManila, begging them to use their influence--but they themselves\r\nwere already in the rebel camp. No form of compensation in money or\r\narmament for the captives' liberty could be officially made without\r\ninvolving Spain in a _casus belli_ with America. Recognition of a\r\nPhilippine Republic would have been in direct opposition to the spirit\r\nof the treaty of peace. In September, 1898, the Superiors of the\r\nregular clergy in Manila appealed to Rome; the Vatican communicated\r\nwith President McKinley, and the President sent an inquiry to\r\nMaj.-General E. S. Otis concerning the captive friars. General\r\nOtis, after investigation, reported that these prisoners were fairly\r\nwell treated. In the following month, whilst the Treaty of Paris was\r\nunder discussion, the Spanish Government appealed to the United States\r\nGovernment to aid them in the rescue of the prisoners, and orders to do\r\nso were transmitted to General Otis. The Filipinos and the Americans\r\nwere ostensibly on good terms at that period, and General Otis\r\nsuggested to Aguinaldo that the friars and civilian Spaniards should be\r\nset free. On the subject of this request, Aguinaldo replied to General\r\nOtis by letter dated Malolos, November 3, 1898, as follows, viz:--\"The\r\nPhilippine people wish to retain the Spanish civil functionaries in\r\norder to obtain the liberty of the Filipinos who are banished and\r\nunder arrest, and the friars in  order to obtain from the Vatican a\r\nrecognition of the rights of the Philippine secular clergy.... It is\r\nnot hatred or vengeance which inspires the Filipinos to retain the\r\nSpanish civil and religious functionaries, but political expediency,\r\nand the tranquillity of the Philippine people demands this measure.\"\r\n\r\nAt this date there were hundreds of Philippine prisoners held by\r\nthe Spanish Government in different places, some of them under\r\nworse conditions than the Spanish prisoners. For instance, 218 were\r\ndeported to the fever-stricken colony of Fernando Po, and only 94 of\r\nthem came out alive. The treaty of peace was still being discussed,\r\nand on its conclusion, Article 6 stipulated a release of \"all persons\r\ndetained or imprisoned for political offences in connection with\r\nthe insurrections in Cuba and the Philippines,\" and that the United\r\nStates would \"undertake to obtain the release of all Spanish prisoners\r\nin the hands of the insurgents\"; but there was no proviso that the\r\nrelease of the Philippine prisoners should depend on that of the\r\nSpanish prisoners, and after the treaty was signed, Spain showed no\r\nparticular haste immediately to carry out her undertaking to return\r\nthe Philippine prisoners to their islands.\r\n\r\nWhen General Diego de los Rios evacuated the Visayas Islands and\r\nbrought his Spanish troops to Manila, _en route_ for Spain, January,\r\n1899, he himself remained in  Manila as a Spanish Government Agent\r\nto obtain the release of the prisoners. For the special purpose, by\r\ncourtesy of the American authorities, he held a kind of semi-official\r\nposition;   but  he   did  not   care   to   risk   his person within\r\nthe rebel lines. A Spanish merchant, Don Antonio Fuset, president of\r\nthe Spanish Club, undertook the negotiations, and succeeded in inducing\r\nApolinario Mabini to issue a decree signed by Aguinaldo and himself,\r\ndated  January 22, 1899, giving liberty to all invalid civilians\r\nand soldiers. Simultaneously the Spanish Press in Manila was abusing\r\nAguinaldo and his officers, calling them  monkeys and using epithets\r\nwhich brought down their vengeance on the captives themselves.\r\n\r\nThe outbreak of the War of Independence (February 4, 1899)\r\nprecluded direct American intervention in favour of the Spanish\r\nprisoners. General Rios, whose importance was being overshadowed by\r\nSenor Fuset's productive activity, cabled to Madrid that he would\r\nattend to the matter himself. But the didactic tone of his letters\r\nto Aguinaldo was not conducive to a happy result, and having frankly\r\nconfessed his failure, the general made an appeal to the consuls and\r\nforeign merchants to exercise conjointly their influence. A letter\r\nof appeal from them was therefore drawn up and confided for delivery\r\nin the insurgent camp to my late friend Baron Du Marais. [228] This\r\nchivalrous gentleman, well known as the personification of integrity\r\nand honour, had resided many years in the Islands and spoke Tagalog\r\nfluently. On reaching the insurgent camp he was imprisoned on the\r\ncharge of being a spy, but was shortly afterwards released, and on\r\nhis way back to the capital he was waylaid by the natives, who foully\r\nmurdered him. Senor Fuset then resumed his labours, and, as a result\r\nof his appeal to the generosity of his countrymen, he was able to\r\nset out for Boac and Batangas in the little steamer _Castellano_ to\r\ncarry supplies to the prisoners detained in those localities. On his\r\njourney he distributed to them 500 cotton suits, 290 pairs of shoes,\r\n100 pairs of _alpargatas_ (a sort of hempen shoe or sandal made in\r\nSpain), 14,375 packets of cigarettes, and P1,287. Several subsequent\r\nexpeditions carried supplies to the prisoners, the total amount of\r\nmaterial aid furnished to them, in goods and money, being estimated\r\nat P60,000.\r\n\r\nAfter five months of fruitless effort General Diego de los Rios\r\nleft Manila for Spain on June 3, 1899, and was succeeded by General\r\nNicolas Jaramillo as the negotiator representing Spain. Moreover,\r\nit was desirable to recall General Rios, whose cablegrams commenting\r\non the Americans' military operations were making him a _persona non\r\ngrata_ in official circles.\r\n\r\nWith the requisite passes procured from Aguinaldo, two Spanish envoys,\r\nSenores Toral and Rio, and the Filipino Enrique Marcaida set out for\r\nthe insurgent seat of government, which was then at Tarlac. On their\r\narrival there (June 23) Aguinaldo appointed three commissioners to\r\nmeet them. At the first meeting the Filipinos agreed to liberate\r\nall except the friars, because these might raise trouble. At the\r\nnext meeting they offered liberty to all on the following terms,\r\nimpossible of acceptance by the Spanish commissioners, viz.:--\r\n\r\n(1) Spain is to recognize the Independence of the Philippines and\r\nrepudiate the cession of the Islands to America.\r\n\r\n(2) After the recognition and repudiation stipulated in Clause 1, the\r\nPhilippine Republic will liberate all the prisoners, without exception,\r\nand will pay their expenses back to Spain. If Spain cannot possibly\r\naccede to the conditions of Clause 1, the Philippine Republic will\r\naccept, in lieu thereof, arms, munitions and provisions, or their\r\nmoney equivalent.\r\n\r\n(3) The Spanish Government is to exchange the receipts given for\r\nmoney subscribed to the Philippine loan for the certificates of that\r\nloan. [229]\r\n\r\nThe Filipinos declined to say what sum they would consider an\r\nequivalent, as per Clause 2, and invited the Spaniards to make an\r\noffer. The Spaniards then proposed P1,000,000.\r\n\r\nOn June 29, at the third conference, the Filipinos refused to accept\r\nless than P6,000,000. This demand stupefied the Spaniards, who said\r\nthey would return to consult General Jaramillo; but they were reluctant\r\nto leave the matter unsettled, and a last conference was held the next\r\nday, when the Spaniards raised their offer to P2,000,000. The Filipinos\r\nthen reduced their demand to P3,000,000, which the Spaniards objected\r\nto; but they were successful in obtaining the liberty of the Baler\r\ngarrison and 22 invalids, with all of whom they returned to Manila\r\n(_vide_ Baler garrison, p. 494).\r\n\r\nOn July 5 a decree was issued from Tarlac, signed by Emilio Aguinaldo\r\nand countersigned by his minister, Pedro A. Paterno, to the effect that\r\nall invalid prisoners would be at liberty to embark at certain ports\r\ndesignated, if vessels were sent for them flying only the Spanish\r\nflag and a white one bearing the Red Cross. Difficulties, however,\r\narose with the American authorities which impeded the execution of\r\nthis plan. General Jaramillo was preparing to send his commissioners\r\nagain to Tarlac when he received a cablegram from Madrid telling him\r\nto suspend further overtures to the insurgents because international\r\ncomplications were threatened. It appears that America objected to\r\nthe proposal to pay to the insurgents a large sum of money.\r\n\r\nOn August 9 General Jaramillo wished to send the Spanish warship\r\n_General Alava_, or a Spanish merchant vessel with the Red Cross\r\nflag, to San Fernando de la Union with provisions for the prisoners,\r\nbut General E. S. Otis objected to the proposed proceeding on the\r\nground that it would compromise the dignity of America. But General\r\nJaramillo still persisted in his project, and after a lapse of three\r\ndays he again addressed a note on the subject to General E. S. Otis,\r\nfrom whom he received another negative reply. On September 5 General\r\nJaramillo informed General Otis that the prisoners were concentrated in\r\nthe ports named in the insurgents' decree, and solicited permission to\r\nsend a vessel flying the Red Cross flag to receive them. Three days\r\nafterwards General Otis replied that a recognition of Aguinaldo's\r\npretension to designate certain ports for the Spaniards' embarkation\r\nwould be not only humiliating but ridiculous. Furthermore, he was\r\nexpecting reinforcements shortly, with which peace would be assured\r\nand all the ports re-opened, and then America would co-operate for\r\nthe liberty of the prisoners. General Jaramillo replied to this\r\ncommunication by addressing to General Otis a lengthy philosophical\r\nepistle on the principles involved in the question, but as General\r\nOtis did not care to continue the correspondence, General Jaramillo\r\nsought to bring pressure on him by notifying him that the s.s. _P. de\r\nSatrustegui_ would be detained 48 hours in order to learn his decision\r\nas to whether that vessel could call for the prisoners. As General\r\nOtis did not reply within the prescribed period General Jaramillo\r\nwent to see him personally and ineffectually opened his heart to him\r\nin very energetic terms, which General Otis complacently tolerated\r\nbut persisted in his negative resolution, and the interview ended\r\nwith the suggestion that General Jaramillo should obtain Aguinaldo's\r\nconsent for a vessel carrying the American flag to enter the ports\r\nand bring away the prisoners.\r\n\r\nAbout this time an incident occurred which, but for the graciousness\r\nof General Otis, might have operated very adversely to the interests\r\nof those concerned. In September, 1899, a Spanish lady arrived in\r\nManila saying that she was the representative of a Society of Barcelona\r\nLadies formed to negotiate the liberation of the prisoners. She brought\r\nwith her a petition addressed to Aguinaldo, said to bear about 3,000\r\nsignatures. But unfortunately the document contained so many offensive\r\nallusions to the Americans that General Jaramillo declined to be\r\nassociated with it in any way. No obstacle was placed in the way of\r\nthe lady if she wished to present her petition privately to Aguinaldo;\r\nbut, apparently out of spite, she had a large number of copies printed\r\nand published broadcast in Manila. General Jaramillo felt it his duty\r\nto apologize to General Otis and repudiate all connexion with this\r\noffensive proceeding, which General Otis very affably excused as an\r\neccentricity not worthy of serious notice.\r\n\r\nOn September 29 the Spanish commissioners, Toral and Rio, again started\r\nfor the insurgent capital, Tarlac. The proposal for vessels to enter\r\nthe ports under the American flag was rejected by Aguinaldo's advisers,\r\nPedro A. Paterno and Felipe Buencamino, and negotiations were resumed\r\non the money indemnity basis. The Aguinaldo party had already had sore\r\nexperience of the worth of an agreement made with Spanish officials,\r\nand during the discussion they raised the question of the validity of\r\ntheir powers and the guarantee for their proposed undertakings. The\r\nreal difficulty was that America might object to Spain officially\r\nmaking any compact whatsoever which must necessarily involve a\r\nrecognition of the Philippine Republic; and even as it was, the\r\nrenewed suggestion of a payment of millions of dollars was a secret\r\nnegotiation. The Spanish commissioners started by proposing that\r\nAguinaldo should give up 80 per cent. of the prisoners on certain\r\nconditions _to be agreed upon thereafter_, and retain the 20 per\r\ncent. as guarantee for the fulfilment of these hypothetical terms;\r\nmoreover, even the 20 per cent. were to be concentrated at a place to\r\nbe _mutually agreed upon,_ etc. The artfulness of the commissioners'\r\nscheme was too apparent for Paterno and Buencamino to accept it. The\r\ncommissioners then presented the Insurgent Government with a voluminous\r\nphilosophical dissertation on the subject, whilst the Filipinos sought\r\nbrief facts and tangible conditions. The Filipinos then offered to\r\naddress a note to the Spanish Consul in Manila to the effect that\r\nthe prisoners who were infirm would be delivered at certain ports\r\nas already stated, and that he could send ships for them on certain\r\nterms. Still the commissioners lingered in Tarlac, and on October 23\r\nthe Filipinos made the following proposals, which were practically\r\nan intimation to close the debate.\r\n\r\n1. Recognition of the Philippine Republic as soon as the difficulties\r\nwith America should be overcome.\r\n\r\n2. The payment of seven millions of pesos.\r\n\r\nThese conditions having been rejected by the commissioners, Aguinaldo's\r\nadvisers drew up a document stating the reasons why the negotiations\r\nhad fallen through, with special reference to the insufficiency of\r\nthe commissioners' powers and the inadmissibility of their attitude\r\nin desiring to treat with Aguinaldo individually instead of with\r\nhis Government, for which reasons the Philippine Republic formally\r\ndeclared its resolution definitely to cease all negotiations with the\r\nSpanish commissioners, preferring to deal directly with the Spanish\r\nGovernment. Not satisfied with this formal intimation the commissioners\r\nasked that the conditions of the liberation already granted since\r\nJanuary to the invalid prisoners should be modified, and that they\r\nshould be handed over to them--the very persons already declared to\r\nbe insufficiently authorized. In response to this importunity the\r\nrequisite passports were immediately sent to the commissioners to\r\nenable them to quit the Philippine Republic's seat of government and\r\nterritory forthwith.\r\n\r\nApart from the moral aspect of the case, and regarded only in\r\nthe light of a business transaction, it does not appear that the\r\nFilipinos were ever offered a solid guarantee for the fulfilment of\r\nany of the proposed conditions. But the insuperable difficulty was\r\nSpain's inability to comply with the Filipinos' essential condition\r\nof recognition of the Philippine Republic.\r\n\r\nFinally, in the prosecution of the War of Independence, the American\r\ntroops drove the insurgents so hard, capturing town after town, that\r\nthey were constrained to abandon the custody of the Spanish survivors,\r\nwho flocked in groups to the American posts, and eventually embarked\r\nfor their native land. On May 20, 1900, the Spanish Commission received\r\na letter from the insurgent General Trias stating that orders had\r\nbeen issued to liberate all the prisoners.\r\n\r\nIn due course the Spanish warships sunk at the Battle of Cavite were\r\nraised by the Americans, and the dead bodies of Spain's defenders on\r\nthat memorable day were handed over to a Spanish Commission. The same\r\norganization also took charge of the bodies recovered from Baler (east\r\ncoast of Luzon), and after a _Requiem_ mass was said at the Cathedral\r\nthese mortal remains were conducted with appropriate solemnity on\r\nboard the s.s. _Isla de Panay_, which left Manila for Barcelona on\r\nFebruary 14, 1904.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXVII\r\n\r\nEnd of the War of Independence and After\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the month of May, 1901, the prisons were overflowing with captured\r\ninsurgents, and the military authorities found an ostensible reason\r\nfor liberating a number of them. A General Order was issued that to\r\n\"signalize the recent surrender of General Manuel Tinio [230] and\r\nother prominent leaders,\" one thousand prisoners of war would be\r\nreleased on taking the oath of allegiance. The flame of organized\r\ninsurrection was almost extinguished, but there still remained some\r\ndangerous embers. Bands of armed natives wandered through the provinces\r\nunder the name of insurgents, and on July 31, 1901, one of Aguinaldo's\r\nsubordinate generals, named Miguel Malvar, a native of Santo Tomas\r\n(Batangas) issued a manifesto from the \"Slopes of the Maquiling\"\r\n(Laguna Province), announcing that he had assumed the position of\r\nSupreme Chief. Before the war he had little to lose, but fishing\r\nin troubled waters and gulling the people with _anting-anting_ and\r\nthe \"signs in the clouds\" proved to be a profitable occupation to\r\nmany. An expedition was sent against him, and he was utterly routed\r\nin an engagement which took place near his native town. After Miguel\r\nMalvar surrendered (April 16, 1902) and Vicente Lucban was captured\r\nin Samar (April 27, 1902), the war (officially termed \"insurrection\")\r\nactually terminated, and was formally declared ended on the publication\r\nof President Roosevelt's Peace Proclamation and Amnesty grant, dated\r\nJuly 4, 1902. A sedition law was passed under which every disturber\r\nof the public peace would be thenceforth arraigned, and all acts of\r\nviolence, pillage, etc., would come under the common laws affecting\r\nthose crimes. In short, insurgency ceased to be a valid plea; if it\r\nexisted in fact, officially it had become a dead letter. Those who\r\nstill lingered in the penumbra between belligerence and brigandage\r\nwere thenceforth treated as common outlaws whose acts bore no political\r\nsignificance whatever. The notorious \"General\" San Miguel, for a long\r\ntime the terror of Rizal Province, was given no quarter, but shot on\r\nthe field at Corral-na-bato in March, 1903. One of the famous bandits,\r\nclaiming to be an insurgent, was Faustino Guillermo, who made laws,\r\nlevied tribute, issued army commissions, divided the country up into\r\nmilitary departments, and defied the Government until his stratagem\r\nto induce the constabulary to desert brought about his own capture in\r\nthe Bosoboso Mountain (Morong) in June, 1903. A mass of papers seized\r\nrevealed his pretension to be a patriotic saviour of his people, but\r\nit is difficult indeed to follow the reasoning of a man who starts on\r\nthat line by sacking his own countrymen's villages. Another interesting\r\nindividual was Artemio Ricarte, formerly a primary schoolmaster. In\r\n1899 he led a column under Aguinaldo, and was subsequently his\r\ngeneral specially commissioned to raise revolt inside the capital;\r\nbut the attempt failed, and many arrests followed. During the war he\r\nwas captured by the Americans, to whom he refused to take the oath\r\nof allegiance and was deported to Guam. In Washington it was decided\r\nto release the political prisoners on that island, and Ricarte and\r\nMabini were brought back to Manila. As Ricarte still refused to take\r\nthe oath, he was banished, and went to Hong-Kong in February, 1903. In\r\nthe following December he returned to Manila disguised as a seaman,\r\nand stole ashore in the crowd of stevedore labourers. Assuming the\r\nludicrous title of the \"Viper,\" he established what he called the\r\n\"triumvirate\" government in the provinces, and declared war on the\r\nAmericans. His operations in this direction were mostly limited to\r\nsending crackbrained letters to the Civil Governor in Manila from his\r\n\"camp in the sky,\" but his perturbation of the rural districts had to\r\nbe suppressed. At length, after a long search, he was taken prisoner\r\nat the cockpit in Mariveles in May, 1904. He and his confederates were\r\nbrought to trial on the two counts of carrying arms without licence\r\nand sedition, the revelations of the \"triumvirate,\" which were comical\r\nin the extreme, affording much amusement to the reading public. The\r\njudgement of the court on Ricarte was six years' imprisonment and a\r\nfine of $6,000.\r\n\r\nApolinario Mabini, Ricarte's companion in exile, was one of the most\r\nconspicuous figures in the War of Independence. Of poor parentage,\r\nhe was born at Tanauan (Batangas) in May, 1864, and having finished\r\nhis studies in Manila he took up the law as a profession, living in\r\nobscurity until the Rebellion, during which he became the recognized\r\nleader of the Irreconcilables and Prime Minister in the Malolos\r\nGovernment. In the political sphere he was the soul of the insurgent\r\nmovement, the ruling power behind the presidency of Aguinaldo. It\r\nwas he who drafted the Constitution of the Philippine Republic, dated\r\nJanuary 21, 1899 (_vide_ p. 486). Taken prisoner by the Americans in\r\nDecember, 1899, he was imprisoned on his refusal to subscribe to the\r\noath of allegiance. On August 1, 1900, he was granted leave to appear\r\nbefore the Philippine Commission, presided over by Mr. W. H. Taft. He\r\ndesired to show that, according to his lights, he was not stubbornly\r\nholding out against reason. As Mabini was not permitted to discuss\r\nabstract matters, and Mr. Taft reiterated the intention to establish\r\nAmerican sovereignty in the Islands, their views were at variance,\r\nand Mabini was deported to Guam, but allowed the privilege of taking\r\nhis son there as his companion in exile. On his return to Manila in\r\nFebruary, 1903, he reluctantly took the required oath and was permitted\r\nto remain in the capital. Suffering from paralysis for years previous,\r\nhis mental energy, as a chronic invalid, was amazing. Three months\r\nafter his return to the metropolis he was seized with cholera, to\r\nwhich he succumbed on May 13, 1903, at the early age of thirty-nine, to\r\nthe great regret of his countrymen and of his many European admirers.\r\n\r\nThe Irreconcilables, even at the present day, persist in qualifying\r\nas legitimate warfare that condition of provincial perturbation\r\nwhich the Americans and the Federal Party hold to be outlawry\r\nand brigandage. Hence the most desperate leaders and their bands\r\nof cut-throats are, in the Irreconcilables' phraseology, merely\r\ninsurgents still protesting against American dominion. As late\r\nas February, 1902, an attempt was made to revive the war in Leyte\r\nIsland. At that date a certain Florentino Penaranda, styling himself\r\nthe Insurrectionary Political-Military Chief, issued a proclamation\r\nin his island addressed \"in particular to those who are serving under\r\nthe Americans.\" This document, the preamble of which is indited in\r\nlofty language, carrying the reader mentally all round North and\r\nSouth America, Abyssinia and Europe, terminates with a concession of\r\npardon to all who repent their delinquency in serving the Americans,\r\nand an invitation to Filipinos and foreigners to join his standard. It\r\nhad little immediate effect, but it may have given an impulse to the\r\nbrigandage which was subsequently carried on so ferociously under a\r\nnotorious, wary ruffian named Tumayo. Thousands, too long accustomed\r\nto a lawless, emotional existence to settle down to prosaic civil\r\nlife, went to swell the ranks of brigands, but it would exceed the\r\nlimits of this work to refer to the over 15,000 expeditions made\r\nto suppress them. Brigandage (_vide_ p. 235) has been rife in the\r\nIslands for a century and a half, and will probably continue to exist\r\nuntil a network of railways in each large island makes it almost\r\nimpossible. But brigandage in Spanish times was very mild compared\r\nwith what it is now. Such a thing as a common highwayman was almost\r\nunknown. The brigands of that period--the _Tulisanes_ of the north\r\nand the _Pulajanes_ of the south--went in parties who took days to\r\nconcoct a plan for attacking a country residence, or a homestead, for\r\nrobbery and murder. The assault was almost invariably made at night,\r\nand the marauders lived in the mountains, avoiding the highroads and\r\nthe well-known tracks. The traveller might then go about the Islands\r\nfor years without ever seeing a brigand; now that they have increased\r\nso enormously since the war, there is not business enough for them\r\nin the old way, and they infest the highways and villages. One effect\r\nof the revolution has been to diminish greatly the awe with which the\r\nnative regarded the European before they had crossed swords in regular\r\nwarfare. Again, since 1898, the fact that here and there a white man\r\nmade common cause with outlaws has had a detrimental effect on the\r\nwhite man's prestige, and the new caste of bandits which has come\r\ninto existence is far more audacious than its predecessor. Formerly\r\nthe outlaws had only bowie-knives and a few fowling-pieces; now they\r\nhave an ample supply of rifles. Hence, since the American advent,\r\nthe single traveller and his servant journey at great risk in the\r\nso-called civilized provinces, especially if the traveller has\r\nAnglo-Saxon features. Parties of three or four, well armed, are\r\nfairly safe. Fierce fights with outlaws are of common occurrence;\r\na full record of brigand depredations would fill a volume, and one\r\ncan only here refer to a few remarkable cases.\r\n\r\nEarly in 1904 a Spanish planter of many years' standing, named\r\nAmechazurra, and his brother-in-law, Joaquin Guaso, were kidnapped\r\nand held for ransom. When the sum was carried to the brigands'\r\nhaunt, Guaso was found with his wrists broken and severely tortured\r\nwith bowie-knife cuts and lance-thrusts. Having no power to use his\r\nhands, his black beard was full of white maggots. In this state he\r\nwas delivered to his rescuers and died the next day. Since the close\r\nof the war up to the present day the provinces of Batangas and Cavite,\r\nless than a day's journey from the capital, have not ceased to be in a\r\ndeplorable condition of lawlessness. The principal leaders, Montalon\r\nand Felizardo, [231] were formerly officers under the command of the\r\ninsurgent General Manuel Trias, who surrendered to the Americans\r\nand afterwards accepted office as Civil Governor of the Province\r\nof Cavite. In this capacity he made many unsuccessful attempts to\r\ncapture his former colleagues, but owing to his failure to restore\r\ntranquillity to the province he resigned his governorship in 1903. The\r\nMontalon and Felizardo bands, well armed, constantly overran the two\r\nadjoining provinces to murder the people, pillage their homes, and\r\nset fire to the villages. They bore an inveterate hatred towards all\r\nwho accepted American dominion, and specially detested their former\r\nchief Trias, who, since his return from the St. Louis Exhibition,\r\nhas shown a very pro-American tendency. The history of their crimes\r\ncovers a period of five years. Felizardo was remarkable for his\r\naudacity, his fine horsemanship, and his expert marksmanship. During\r\nan attack on Paranaque, mounted on a beautiful pony stolen from the\r\nrace-track of Pasay, he rode swiftly past a constabulary sentinel,\r\nwho shot at him and missed him, whilst Felizardo, from his seat in the\r\nsaddle, shot the sentinel dead. The evening before the day Governor\r\nTaft intended to sail for the United States, on his retirement from\r\nthe governorship, Montalon hanged two constabulary men at a place\r\nwithin sight of Manila. In December, 1904, all this district was\r\nso infested with cut-throats that Manuel Trias, although no longer\r\nan official, offered to organize and lead a party of 300 volunteers\r\nagainst them. On January 24, 1905, the same bandits, Felizardo and\r\nMontalon, at the head of about 300 of their class, including two\r\nAmerican negroes, raided Trias's native town of San Francisco de\r\nMalabon, murdered an American surgeon and one constabulary private,\r\nand seriously wounded three more. They looted the municipal treasury\r\nof 2,000 pesos and 25 carbines, and carried off Trias's wife and two\r\nchildren, presumably to hold them for ransom. The chief object of\r\nthe attack was to murder Trias, their arch-enemy, but he was away\r\nfrom home at the time. On his return he set out in pursuit of the\r\nband at the head of the native constabulary. The outlaws had about\r\n160 small firearms, and during the chase several fierce fights took\r\nplace. Being hunted from place to place incessantly, they eventually\r\nreleased Trias's wife and children so as to facilitate their own\r\nescape. Constabulary was insufficient to cope with the marauders,\r\nand regular troops had to be sent to these provinces. In February,\r\n1905, a posse of 25 Moro fighting-men was brought up from Siassi\r\n(Tapul group) to hunt down the brigands. Launches patrolled the\r\nBay of Manila with constabulary on board to intercept the passage\r\nof brigands from one province to another, for lawlessness was, more\r\nor less, constantly rife in several of the Luzon provinces and half\r\na dozen other islands for years after the end of the war. From 1902\r\nonwards, half the provinces of Albay, Bulacan, Bataan, Cavite, Ilocos\r\nSur, and the islands of Camaguin, Samar, Leyte, Negros, Cebu, etc.,\r\nhave been infested, at different times, with brigands, or latter-day\r\ninsurgents, as the different parties choose to call them. The regular\r\ntroops, the constabulary, and other armed forces combined were unable\r\nto exterminate brigandage. The system of \"concentration\" circuits,\r\nwhich had given such adverse results during the Rebellion (_vide_\r\np. 392), was revived in the provinces of Batangas and Cavite, obliging\r\nthe waverers between submission and recalcitration to accept a defined\r\nlegal or illegal status. Consequently many of the common people went to\r\nswell the roving bands of outlaws, whilst those who had a greater love\r\nfor home, or property at stake, remained within the prescribed limits,\r\nin discontented, sullen compliance with the inevitable. The system\r\ninterrupted the people's usual occupations, retarded agriculture,\r\nand produced general dissatisfaction. The Insular Government then\r\nhad recourse to an extreme measure which practically implied the\r\nimposition of compulsory military service on every male American,\r\nforeign, or native inhabitant between the ages of eighteen to fifty\r\nyears, with the exception of certain professions specified in the\r\nPhilippine Commission Act No. 1309, dated March 22, 1905. Under this\r\nlaw the native mayor of a town can compel any able-bodied American\r\n(not exempted under the Act) to give five days a month service in\r\nhunting down brigands, under a maximum penalty of P100 fine and three\r\nmonths' imprisonment. And, subject to the same penalty for refusal,\r\nany proprietor or tenant (white, coloured, or native) residing in any\r\nmunicipality, or ward, must report, within 24 hours, to the municipal\r\nauthority, the name, residence, and description of _any_ person (not\r\nbeing a resident) to whom he gave assistance or lodging. In no colony\r\nwhere the value of the white man's prestige is appreciated would such\r\na law have been promulgated.\r\n\r\nThe proceedings of the constabulary in the disturbed provinces\r\nhaving been publicly impugned in a long series of articles and\r\nreports published in the Manila newspaper _El Renacimiento,_ the\r\neditors of that public organ were brought to trial on a charge of\r\nlibel in July, 1905. The substance of the published allegations\r\nwas that peaceable citizens were molested in their homes and were\r\ncoerced into performing constabulary and military duties by becoming\r\nunwilling brigand-hunters. Among other witnesses who appeared at the\r\ntrial was Emilio Aguinaldo, who testified that he had been forced to\r\nleave his home and present himself to a constabulary officer, who,\r\nhe affirmed, bullied and insulted him because he refused to leave his\r\ndaily occupations and risk his life in brigand-hunting. In view of\r\nthe peculiar position of Aguinaldo as a fallen foe, perhaps it would\r\nhave been better not to have disturbed him in his peaceful life as\r\na law-abiding citizen, lest the world should misconstrue the intention.\r\n\r\nConfined to Pangasinan and La Union provinces, there is an organization\r\nknown as the \"Guards of Honour.\" Its recruits are very numerous,\r\ntheir chief vocation being cattle-stealing and filching other people's\r\ngoods without unnecessary violence. It is feared they may extend their\r\noperations to other branches of perversity. The society is said to\r\nbe a continuation of the _Guardia de Honor_ created by the Spaniards\r\nand stimulated by the friars in Pangasinan as a check on the rebels\r\nduring the events of 1896-98. At the American advent they continued\r\nto operate independently against the insurgents, whom they harassed\r\nvery considerably during the flight northwards from Tarlac. It was\r\nto escape the vengeance of this party that Aguinaldo's Secretary of\r\nState (according to his verbal statement to me) allowed himself to\r\nfall prisoner to the Americans.\r\n\r\nThe _Pulajanes_ of Samar seem to be as much in possession of that\r\nIsland as the Americans themselves, and its history, from the\r\nrevolution up to date, is a lugubrious repetition of bloodshed,\r\npillage, and incendiarism. The deeds of the notorious Vicente Lucban\r\nwere condoned under the Amnesty of 1902, but the marauding organization\r\nis maintained and revived by brigands of the first water. Every\r\nmove of the government troops is known to the _pulajanes_. The spy,\r\nstationed at a pass, after shouting the news of the enemy's approach\r\nto the next spy, darts into the jungle, and so on all along the line,\r\nin most orderly fashion, until the main column is advised. In July,\r\n1904, they slaughtered half the inhabitants of the little coast village\r\nof Taviran, mutilated their corpses, and then set out for the town of\r\nSanta Elena, which was burnt to the ground. In December of that year\r\nover a thousand _pulajanes_ besieged the town of Taft (formerly Tubig),\r\nheld by a detachment of native scouts, whilst another party, hidden\r\nin the mountains, fell like an avalanche upon a squad of 43 scouts,\r\nled by an American lieutenant, on their way to the town of Dolores,\r\nand in ten minutes killed the officer and 37 of his men. After this\r\nmournful victory the brigands went to reinforce their comrades at\r\nTaft, swelling their forces _en route_, so that the besiegers of Taft\r\namounted to a total of about 2,000 men. About the same time some 400\r\n_pulajanes_ were met by a few hundred so-called native volunteers, who,\r\ninstead of fighting, joined forces and attacked a scout detachment\r\nwhilst crossing a river. Twenty of the scouts were cut to pieces and\r\nmutilated, whilst thirteen more died of their wounds.\r\n\r\nCommunication in the Island is extremely difficult; the maintenance of\r\ntelegraph-lines is impossible through a hostile country, and messages\r\nsent by natives are often intercepted, or, as sometimes happens,\r\nthe messengers, to save their lives, naturally make common cause\r\nwith the bandits whom they meet on the way. The hemp-growers and\r\ncoast-trading population, who have no sympathy with the brigands,\r\nare indeed obliged, for their own security, to give them passive\r\nsupport. Hundreds in the coast villages who are too poor to give, have\r\nto flee into hiding and live like animals in dread of constabulary\r\nand _pulajanes_ alike. Between \"insurgency\" and \"brigandage,\" in this\r\nIsland, there was never a very wide difference, and when General Allen,\r\nthe Chief of the Constabulary, took the field in person in December,\r\n1904, he had reason to believe that the notorious ex-insurgent Colonel\r\nGuevara was the moving spirit in the lawlessness. Guevara, who had\r\nbeen disappointed at not securing the civil governorship of the\r\nIsland, was suddenly seized and confined at Catbalogan jail to await\r\nhis trial. The Samar _pulajanes_ are organized like regular troops,\r\nwith their generals and officers, but they are deluded by a sort of\r\nmystic religious teaching under the guidance of a native pope. In\r\nJanuary, 1905, the town of Balangiga (_vide_ p. 536), so sadly famous\r\nin the history of Samar on account of the massacre of American troops\r\nduring the war, became a _pulajan_ recruiting station. A raid upon the\r\nplace resulted in the capture of twenty chiefs, gorgeously uniformed,\r\nwith gaudy _anting-anting _amulets on their breasts to protect them\r\nfrom American bullets. At this time the regimental Camp Connell, at\r\nCalbayoc, was so depleted of troops that less than a hundred men were\r\nleft to defend it. Situated on a pretty site, the camp consists of two\r\nlines of wooden buildings running along the shore for about a mile. At\r\none extremity is the hospital and at the other the quartermaster's\r\ndepot. It has no defences whatever, and as I rode along the central\r\navenue of beautiful palms, after meeting the ladies at a ball, I\r\npictured to myself the chapter of horror which a determined attack\r\nmight one day add to the doleful annals of dark Samar.\r\n\r\nMatters became so serious that in March, 1905, the divisional\r\ncommander, General Corbin, joined General Allen in the operations\r\nin this Island. Full of tragedy is the record of this region, and\r\namongst its numerous heroes was a Captain Hendryx. In 1902, whilst\r\nout with a detachment of constabulary, he was attacked, defeated, and\r\nreported killed. He was seen to drop and roll into a gully. But four\r\ndays later there wandered back to the camp a man half dead with hunger\r\nand covered with festering wounds, some so infected that, but for the\r\napplication of tobacco, gangrene would have set in. It was Captain\r\nHendryx. Delirious for a while, he finally recovered and resumed his\r\nduties. A couple of years afterwards he was shipwrecked going round\r\nthe coast on the _Masbate_. For days he and the ship-master alone\r\nbattled with the stormy waves, a howling wind ahead, and a murderous\r\nrabble on the coast waiting for their blood. On the verge of death\r\nthey reached a desolate spot whence the poor captain saved his body\r\nfrom destruction, but with prostrate nerves, rendering him quite unfit\r\nfor further service. And the carnage in the Samar jungles, which has\r\ncaused many a sorrow in the homeland, continues to the present day\r\nwith unabated ferocity. By nature a lovely island, picturesque in\r\nthe extreme, there is a gloom in its loveliness. The friendly native\r\nhas fled for his life; the patches of lowland once planted with sweet\r\npotatoes or rows of hemp-trees, are merging into jungle for want of\r\nthe tiller's hand. The voice of an unseen man gives one a shudder,\r\nlest it be that of a fanatic lurking in the _cogon_ grass to seek his\r\nfellow's blood. Near the coast, half-burnt bamboos show where villages\r\nonce stood; bleached human bones mark the sites of human conflict,\r\nwhilst decay and mournful silence impress one with the desolation of\r\nthis fertile land. The narrow navigable channel separating Samar from\r\nLeyte Island is one of the most delightful bits of tropical scenery.\r\n\r\nThe Constabulary Service Reports for 1903 and 1904 show that in\r\nthe former period there were 357 engagements between brigand bands\r\nand the constabulary (exclusive of the army operations), and in the\r\nlatter period 235 similar engagements. More than 5,000 expeditions\r\nwere undertaken against the outlaws in each year; 1,185 outlaws\r\nwere killed in 1903, and 431 in 1904, 2,722 were wounded or captured\r\nin 1903, and 1,503 in 1904; 3,446 arms of all sorts were seized in\r\n1903, and 994 in 1904. The constabulary losses in killed, wounded,\r\ndied of wounds and disease, and deserted were 223 in 1904. In Cavite\r\nProvince alone, with a population of 134,779, there were, in 1903,\r\nover 400 expeditions, resulting in 20 brigands killed, 23 wounded,\r\nand 253 captured. At this date brigandage is one of the greatest\r\ndeterrents to the prosperous development of the Islands.\r\n\r\nThe Adjutant-General's Report issued in Washington in December, 1901,\r\ngives some interesting figures relating to the Army, for the War of\r\nIndependence period, i.e., from February 4, 1899, to June 30, 1901. The\r\ntotal number of troops sent to the Islands was as follows, viz.:--\r\n\r\n\r\n                            Officers.      Men.\r\n\r\n    Regular Army            1,342        60,933\r\n    Volunteers              2,135        47,867\r\n                            3,477       108,800\r\n\r\n\r\nSome were returning from, whilst others were going to the Islands;\r\nthe largest number in the Islands at any one time (year 1900) was\r\nabout 70,000 men.\r\n\r\nThe total casualties in the above period were as follows, viz.:--\r\n\r\n\r\n                            Officers.  Men.         Total.\r\n\r\n    Dead (all causes)       115         3,384       3,499\r\n    Wounded                 170         2,609       2,779\r\n                            285         5,993       6,278\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the same period the following arms were taken from the insurgents\r\n(captured and surrendered):--\r\n\r\n\r\n                    Revolvers               868\r\n                    Rifles               15,693\r\n                    Cannon                  122\r\n                    Bowie-knives          3,516\r\n\r\n\r\nThe _Insurgent Navy,_ consisting of four small steamers purchased in\r\nSingapore and a few steam-launches, dwindled away to nothing. The\r\n\"Admiral,\" who lived on shore at Gagalangin (near Manila), escaped\r\nto Hong-Kong, but returned to Manila, surrendered, and took the oath\r\nof allegiance on March 3, 1905.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_Sedition_, in its more virulent and active forms, having been\r\nfrustrated by the authorities since the conclusion of the war, the\r\nIrreconcilables conceived the idea of inflaming the passions of the\r\npeople through the medium of the native drama. How the seditious\r\ndramatists could have ever hoped to succeed in the capital itself,\r\nin public theatres, before the eyes of the Americans, is one of those\r\nmysteries which the closest student of native philosophy must fail\r\nto solve.\r\n\r\nThe most notable of these plays were _Hindi aco patay_ (\"I am not\r\ndead\"), _Ualang sugat_ (\"There is no wound\"), _Dabas ng pilac_ (\"Power\r\nof Silver\"), and _Cahapon, Ngayon at Bucas_ (\"Yesterday, to-day, and\r\nto-morrow\"). In each case there was an extra last scene not on the\r\nprogramme. Secret police and American spectators besieged the stage,\r\nand after a free fight, a cracking of heads, and a riotous scuffle\r\nthe curtain dropped (if there were anything left of it) on a general\r\npanic of the innocent and the arrest of the guilty. The latter were\r\nbrought to trial, and their careers cut short by process of law.\r\n\r\nThe simple plot of _Hindi aco patay_ is as follows, viz.:--_Maimbot_\r\n(personifying America) is establishing dominion over the Islands,\r\nassisted by his son _Macamcam_ (American Government), and _Katuiran_\r\n(Reason, Right, and Justice) is called upon to condemn the conduct\r\nof a renegade Filipino who has accepted America's dominion, and\r\nthereby become an outcast among his own people and even his own\r\nfamily. There is to be a wedding, but, before it takes place, a\r\nfuneral cortege passes the house of _Karangalan_ (the bride) with\r\nthe body of _Tangulan_ (the fighting patriot). _Maimbot_ (America)\r\nexclaims, \"Go, bury that man, that Karangalan and her mother may see\r\nhim no more.\" _Tangulan_, however, rising from his coffin, tells them,\r\n\"They must not be married, for I am not dead.\" And as he cries _Hindi\r\naco patay,_ \"I am not dead,\" a radiant sun appears, rising above\r\nthe mountain peaks, simultaneously with the red flag of Philippine\r\nliberty. Then _Katuiran_ (Reason, Right, and Justice) declares that\r\n\"Independence has returned,\" and goes on to explain that the new\r\ninsurrection having discouraged America in her attempt to enslave the\r\npeople, she will await a better opportunity. The flag of Philippine\r\nIndependence is then waved to salute the sun which has shone upon\r\nthe Filipinos to regenerate them and cast away their bondage.\r\n\r\nThe theme of _Cahapon, ngayon at Bucas_ is somewhat similar--a protest\r\nagainst American rule, a threat to rise and expel it, a call to arms,\r\nand a final triumph of the Revolution. About the same time (May,\r\n1903) a seditious play entitled _Cadena de Oro_ (\"The golden chain\")\r\nwas produced in Batangas, and its author was prosecuted. It must,\r\nhowever, be pointed out that there are also many excellent plays\r\nwritten in Tagalog, with liberty to produce them, one of the best\r\nnative dramatists being Don Pedro A. Paterno.\r\n\r\nThere will probably be for a long time to come a certain amount of\r\ndisaffection and a class of wire-pullers, men of property, chiefly\r\nhalf-castes, constantly in the background, urging the masses forward\r\nto their own destruction. Lucrative employments have satisfied the\r\nambition of so many educated Filipinos who must find a living, that\r\nthe same principle--a creation of material interest--might perhaps be\r\nadvantageously extended to the uneducated classes. All the malcontents\r\ncannot become State dependents, but they might easily be helped to\r\nacquire an interest in the soil. The native who has his patch of\r\nsettled land with _unassailable title_ would be loth to risk his all\r\nfor the chimerical advantages of insurrection. The native boor who\r\nhas worked land for years on sufferance, without title, exposed to\r\neviction by a more cunning individual clever enough to follow the\r\ntortuous path which leads to land settlement with absolute title,\r\nfalls an easy prey to the instigator of rebellion. These illiterate\r\npeople need more than a liberal land law--they need to be taken in\r\nhand like children and placed upon the parcelled-out State lands\r\nwith indisputable titles thereto. And if American enterprise were\r\nfostered and encouraged in the neighbourhood of their holdings,\r\ngood example might root them to the soil and convert the _boloman_\r\ninto the industrious husbandman.\r\n\r\nThe poorest native who cannot sow for himself must necessarily\r\nfeed on what his neighbour reaps, and hunger compels him to become\r\na wandering criminal. It is not difficult partially to account for\r\nthe greater number in this condition to-day as compared with Spanish\r\ntimes. In those days there was what the natives termed _cayinin_. It\r\nwas a temporary clearance of a patch of State land on which the\r\nnative would raise a crop one, two, or more seasons. Having no legal\r\nright to the soil he tilled, and consequently no attachment to it,\r\nhe would move on to other virgin land and repeat the operation. In\r\nmaking the clearance the squatter had no respect for State property,\r\nand the damage which he did in indiscriminate destruction of valuable\r\ntimber by fire was not inconsiderable. The law did not countenance the\r\n_cayinin_, but serious measures were seldom taken to prevent it. The\r\nlocal or municipal headmen refrained from interference because, having\r\nno interest whatever in public lands, they did not care, as landowners,\r\nto go out of their way to create a bad feeling against themselves\r\nwhich might one day have fatal consequences. Although no one would\r\nfor a moment suggest a revival of the system, there is the undeniable\r\nfact that in Spanish times thousands of natives lived for years in this\r\nway, and if they had been summarily evicted, or prosecuted by a forest\r\nbureau, necessity would have driven them into brigandage. High wages,\r\ngovernment service, and public works are no remedy; on the contrary,\r\nif the people are thereby attracted to the towns, what will become of\r\nthe true source of Philippine wealth, which is agriculture? Even in\r\nindustrial England the cry of \"Back to the soil\" has been lately raised\r\nby an eminent Englishman known by name to every educated American.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXVIII\r\n\r\nModern Manila\r\n\r\n\r\nCommanding the entrance to Manila Bay there is the Island of\r\nCorregidor, situated 27 miles south-west of the city, towards which\r\nthe traveller glances in vain, expecting to descry something of a\r\nmodern fortress, bristling with artillery of the latest type which,\r\nif there, might hold the only channels leading to the capital against\r\na hostile fleet. The anchorage for steamers is still half a mile to a\r\nmile and a half away from the Pasig River, but the new artificial port,\r\ncommenced by the Spaniards, is being actively brought to completion\r\nby the Americans, so that the day may come when the ocean traveller\r\nwill be able to walk from the steamer down a gangway to a quay and\r\nland on the south, or Walled City, side of the capital.\r\n\r\nIn the city and beautiful suburbs of Manila many changes and some\r\nimprovements have been effected since 1898. After cleansing the\r\ncity to a certain extent, embellishment was commenced, and lastly,\r\nworks of general public utility were undertaken. Public spaces were\r\nlaid out as lawns with walks around them; the old botanical-gardens\r\nenclosure was removed and the site converted into a delightful\r\npromenade; the Luneta Esplanade,--the joy of the Manila elite who\r\nseek the sea-breezes on foot or driving--was reformed, the field of\r\nBagumbayan, which recalls so many sad historical reminiscences since\r\n1872, was drained; breaches were made in the city walls to facilitate\r\nthe entry of American vehicles; new thoroughfares were opened; an iron\r\nbridge, commenced by the Spaniards, was completed; a new Town Hall, a\r\nsplendidly-equipped Government Laboratory, a Government Civil Hospital,\r\nand a Government Printing Office were built; an immense ice-factory\r\nwas erected on the south side of the river to meet the American\r\ndemand for that luxury [232]; also a large refrigerated-meat store,\r\nchiefly for army supply, was constructed, meat, poultry, vegetables,\r\nand other foodstuffs having to be imported on account of the dearth\r\nof beef and tilth cattle due to rinderpest. Fresh meat for private\r\nconsumption (i.e., exclusive of army and navy) is imported into\r\nManila to the value of about $700,000 gold per annum. Reforms of more\r\nurgent public necessity were then introduced. Existing market-places\r\nwere improved, new ones were opened in Tondo and the Walled City;\r\nan excellent slaughter-house was established; the Bridge of Spain\r\nwas widened; a splendidly-equipped fire-engine and brigade service,\r\nwith 150 fire-alarm boxes about the city and suburbs, was organized\r\nand is doing admirable work; roads in the distant suburbs were put in\r\ngood condition, and the reform which all Manila was looking forward\r\nto, namely, the repair of the roads and pavements in the _Escolta_,\r\nthe _Rosario_, and other principal thoroughfares in the heart of the\r\nbusiness quarter of Binondo, was postponed for six years. Up to the\r\nmiddle of 1904 they were in a deplorable condition. The sensation,\r\nwhilst in a gig, of rattling over the uneven stone blocks was as if\r\nthe whole vehicle might at any moment be shattered into a hundred\r\nfragments. The improvement has come at last, and these streets are\r\nnow almost of a billiard-table smoothness. The General Post Office\r\nhas been removed from the congested thoroughfare of the _Escolta_\r\nto a more commodious site. Electric tramcars, in supersession of\r\nhorse-traction, run through the city and suburbs since April 10,\r\n1905. Electric lighting, initiated in Spanish times, is now in\r\ngeneral use, and electric fans--a poor substitute for the punkah--work\r\nhorizontally from the ceilings of many shops, offices, hotels, and\r\nprivate houses. In the residential environs of the city many acres\r\nof ground have been covered with new houses; the once respectable\r\nquarter of Sampaloc [233] has lost its good name since it became\r\nthe favourite haunt of Asiatic and white prostitutes who were not\r\ntolerated in Spanish times. On the other hand, the suburbs of Ermita\r\nand Malate, which are practically a continuation of Manila along\r\nthe seashore from the Luneta Esplanade, are becoming more and more\r\nthe fashionable residential centre. About Sampaloc there is a little\r\ncolony of Japanese shopkeepers, and another group of Japanese fishermen\r\ninhabits Tondo. The Japanese have their Consulate in Manila since the\r\nAmerican advent, their suburban Buddhist temple was inaugurated in\r\nSan Roque on April 22, 1905, and in the same year there was a small\r\nJapanese banking-house in the suburb of Santa Cruz.\r\n\r\nThe Bilibid Jail has been reformed almost beyond recognition\r\nas the old Spanish prison. A great wall runs through the centre,\r\ndividing the long-term from the short-term prisoners. In the centre\r\nis the sentry-box, and from this and all along the top of the wall\r\nevery movement of the prisoners can be watched by the soldier on\r\nguard. Nevertheless, a batch of convicts occasionally breaks jail,\r\nand those who are not shot down escape. Gangs of them are drafted\r\noff for road-making in the provinces, where, on rare occasions,\r\na few have been able to escape and rejoin the brigands. In March,\r\n1905, a squad of 42 convicts working in Albay Province made a dash\r\nfor freedom, and 40 of them got away.\r\n\r\nWith the liberty accorded them under the new dominion the Filipinos\r\nhave their freemason lodges and numerous _casinos_. [234] There are\r\nAmerican clubs for all classes of society--the \"Army and Navy,\" the\r\n\"University,\" the \"United States,\" a dozen other smaller social\r\nmeeting-houses, and societies with quaint denominations such as\r\n\"Knights of Pythias,\" \"Haymakers,\" \"Red Cloud Tribe,\" \"Knights of\r\nthe Golden Eagle,\" etc. Other nationalities have their clubs too; the\r\n_Cercle Francais_ is now located in _Calle Alcala_; the English Club,\r\nwhich was formerly at Nagtajan on the river-bank, has been removed\r\nto Ermita on the seashore, and under the new _regime_ the Chinese\r\nhave their club-house, opened in 1904, in _Calle Dasmarinas_, where\r\na reception was given to the Gov.-General and the elite of Manila\r\nsociety. The entertainment was very sumptuous, the chief attractions\r\nbeing the fantastic decorations, the gorgeous \"joss house\" to a dead\r\nhero, and the chapel in honour of the Virgin del Pilar.\r\n\r\nSeveral new theatres have been opened, the leading one being the\r\n_National_, now called the \"Grand Opera House\"; comedy is played at\r\nthe _Paz_; the _Zorrilla_ (of former times) is fairly well-built,\r\nbut its acoustic properties are extremely defective, and the other\r\nplayhouses are, more properly speaking, large booths, such as the\r\n_Libertad_, the _Taft_, the _Variedades_, and the _Rizal_. In the\r\nlast two very amusing Tagalog plays are performed in dialect. There\r\nis one large music-hall, and a number of cinematograph shows combined\r\nwith variety entertainments.\r\n\r\nThere are numerous second- and third-rate hotels in the city and\r\nsuburbs. The old \"Fonda Lala,\" which existed for many years in the\r\n_Plaza del Conde_, Binondo, as the leading hotel in Spanish days,\r\nis now converted into a large bazaar, called the \"Siglo XX.,\" and\r\nits successor, the \"Hotel de Oriente,\" was purchased by the Insular\r\nGovernment for use as public offices. The old days of comfortable\r\nhackney-carriages in hundreds about the Manila streets, at 50 cents\r\nMex. an hour, are gone for ever. One may now search hours for one,\r\nand, if found, have to pay four or five times the old tariff. Besides\r\nthe fact that everything costs more, the scarcity is due to _Surra_\r\n(_vide_ p. 336), which has enormously reduced the pony stock. There\r\nare occasionally sales of American horses, and it is now one of the\r\nnovelties to see them driven in carriages, and American ladies riding\r\nstraddle-legged on tall hacks. In Spanish days no European gentleman\r\nor lady could be seen in a _carromata_ [235] (gig) about Manila; now\r\nthis vehicle is in general use for both sexes of all classes. Bicycles\r\nwere known in the Islands ten years ago, but soon fell into disuse\r\non account of the bad roads; however, this means of locomotion is\r\nfast reviving.\r\n\r\nThe Press is represented by a large number of American, Spanish and\r\ndialect newspapers. These last were not permitted in Spanish times.\r\n\r\nInnumerable laundries, barbers' shops, Indian and Japanese bazaars,\r\nshoe-black stalls, tailors' shops, book-shops, restaurants, small\r\nhotels, sweetmeat stalls, newspaper kiosks, American drinking-bars,\r\netc., have much altered the appearance of the city. The Filipino,\r\nwho formerly drank nothing but water, now quaffs his iced keg-beer\r\nor cocktail with great gusto, but civilization has not yet made him a\r\ndrunkard. American drinking-shops, or \"saloons,\" as they call them, are\r\nall over the place, except in certain streets in Binondo, where they\r\nhave been prohibited, as a public nuisance, since April 1, 1901. It\r\nwas ascertained at the time of the American occupation that there were\r\n2,206 native shops in Manila where drinks were sold, yet no native\r\nwas ever seen drunk. This number was compulsorily reduced to 400 for\r\na native population of about 190,000, whilst the number of \"saloons\"\r\non February 1, 1900, was 224 for about 5,000 Americans (exclusive of\r\nsoldiers, who presumably would not be about the drinking-bars whilst\r\nthe war was on). But \"saloon\" licences are a large source of revenue\r\nto the municipality, the cost being from $1,200 gold downwards per\r\nannum. A \"saloon,\" however, cannot now be established in defiance\r\nof the general wishes of the neighbours. There is a law (similar\r\nin spirit to the proposed Option Law in England) compelling the\r\nintending \"saloon\" keeper to advertise in several papers for several\r\ndays his intention to open such a place, so that the public may have\r\nan opportunity of opposing that intention if they desire to do so.\r\n\r\nThe American advent has abolished the peaceful solitude of the\r\nWalled City where, in Spanish days, dwelt the friar in secluded\r\nsanctity--where dignitaries and officials were separated by a river\r\nfrom the bubbling world of money-makers. An avalanche of drinking-bars,\r\ntoilet-saloons, restaurants, livery stables, and other catering\r\nconcerns has invaded the ancient abodes of men who made Philippine\r\nhistory. The very names of the city streets remind one of so many\r\nepisodes in the Islands' progress towards civilization that to-day\r\none is led to pause in pensive silence before the escutcheon above the\r\ndoor of what was once a noble residence, to read below a wall-placard,\r\n\"Horses and buggies for hire. The best turn-out in the city. Telephone\r\nNo. ----.\" This levelling spirit is gradually converting the historic\r\nWalled City into a busy retail trading-centre. For a long time the\r\nquestion of demolishing the city walls has been debated. Surely those\r\nwho advocate the destruction of this fine historical monument cannot\r\nbe of that class of Americans whose delight is to travel thousands\r\nof miles, at great expense, only to glance at antiquities not more\r\ninteresting, in the possession of others, and who would fain transport\r\nShakespeare's house bodily to American soil. The moat surrounding the\r\nWalled City is already being filled up, but posterity will be grateful\r\nfor the preservation of those ancient bulwarks--landmarks of a decadent\r\nbut once glorious civilization. Most of the Spanish feast-days have\r\nbeen abolished, including the St. Andrew's day (_vide_ Li-ma-hong,\r\np. 50), and the following have been officially substituted, viz.:--\r\n\r\n\r\n            New Year's Day              January 1\r\n            Washington's birthday       February 22\r\n            Holy Thursday               -- --\r\n            Good Friday                 -- --\r\n            Decoration Day              May 31\r\n            Independence Day            July 4\r\n            Occupation Day              August 13\r\n            Thanksgiving Day            November 24\r\n            Christmas Day               December 25\r\n            Rizal Day                   December 30\r\n\r\n\r\nManila was formerly the capital of the province of that name, as\r\nwell as the Philippine metropolis. Since the American occupation the\r\ncity and suburbs form a kind of federal zone; what was once Manila\r\nProvince is now known as Rizal Province, and with it is incorporated\r\nthat territory formerly designated Morong District, the capital town\r\nof this newly-created province being Pasig.\r\n\r\nThe Municipal Board of Manila is composed of five persons, namely\r\na Philippine mayor and one Philippine and three American members,\r\nwho are practically all nominees of the Insular Government. The\r\nemolument of the mayor and of each member is $4,500. The Board,\r\nassisted by a staff of 20 persons, native and American, has the\r\ncontrol of the ten following departments, viz.:--Police, Fire, Law,\r\nPolice Courts, Justice of the Peace Courts, Public Works, Assessments\r\nand Collections, Deeds Register, City Schools, and Sheriff's Office\r\nconnected with the government of the federal zone of Manila.\r\n\r\nManila is the seat of the Insular Government, which comprises (1) the\r\nPhilippine Commission (Legislative), composed of eight members, of whom\r\nfive (including the president) are Americans and three are Filipinos;\r\n(2) the Civil Commission (Executive), the president of which holds the\r\ndual office of President of the Philippine Commission and Gov.-General,\r\nwhilst the four secretaries of Interior, Finance and Justice, Public\r\nInstruction, and Commerce and Police are those same Americans who\r\nhold office as members of the Philippine Commission. The Philippine\r\nCommission is empowered to pass statutes, subject to ratification\r\nby Congress, the enacting clause being, _By authority of the United\r\nStates, be it enacted by the Philippine Commission_. The Insular\r\nGovernment communicates with the Washington Government through the\r\nDepartment of the Secretary of State for War.\r\n\r\nUp to the end of 1904 the chief authority in these Islands was styled\r\nthe \"Civil Governor.\" Thenceforth, by special Act of Congress, the\r\ntitle was changed to that of \"Governor-General.\"\r\n\r\nThe Emoluments of the Members of the Insular Government, the Chiefs of\r\nDepartments, and the principal officers are as follows, viz. [236]:--\r\n\r\n\r\n                                                                $ gold\r\nPresident of the Philippine and Civil Commissions               20,000\r\nFour American Members of the Philippine Commission,\r\n    _ex-officio_ Members of the Civil Commission           each 15,500\r\nThree Philippine Members of the Philippine Commission       each 5,000\r\n\r\n\r\n_Departments_\r\n\r\nArchitecture Bureau                     Chief                    4,000\r\nArchives, Patents, Copyright and\r\n    Trade Marks                         Chief                    3,000\r\nAgriculture Bureau                      Chief                    4,000\r\nAudit Office                            Auditor                  7,000\r\nBilibid Prison                          Warden                   3,000\r\n[237] Civil Service Board               Chief Examiner           4,000\r\nCourt of First Instance, Manila         each Judge               5,500\r\nCourt of First Instance,                provincial Judge  $4,500 to 5,000\r\nCourt of Land Registration              Judge                    5,000\r\nCourt of Customs Appeal                 Judge                    4,500\r\nCivil Hospital                          Chief Physician          3,000\r\nCivil Sanatorium (Benguet)              Chief Physician          2,400\r\nConstabulary                            Executive Officer        5,500\r\nCoast Guard and Transport Office        Chief (Navy pay)            --\r\nCold Storage and Ice-Plant              Superintendent           3,600\r\nCustoms and Immigration                 Collector of Customs     7,000\r\nEngineering Department                  Consulting Engineer      5,000\r\nEthnological Survey                     Chief                    3,500\r\nEducation Department                    Gen.

Otis up to May 5, 1900, when he returned to America and was\r\nimmediately succeeded by Maj.-General Arthur McArthur. On January 20,\r\n1899, during General Otis's governorship, a Commission of Inquest\r\nwas appointed under the presidency of Dr. Jacob Gould Schurman\r\nknown as the Schurman Commission, which arrived in Manila on May 2\r\nto investigate the state of affairs in the Islands. The Commission\r\nwas instructed to \"endeavour, without interference with the military\r\nauthorities of the United States now in control in the Philippines,\r\nto ascertain what amelioration in the condition of the inhabitants\r\nand what improvements in public order may be practicable.\" The other\r\nmembers of the Commission were Rear-Admiral George Dewey, Charles\r\nDenby, Maj.-General Elwell S. Otis, and Dean C. Worcester. Admiral\r\nDewey, however, was soon relieved of his obligation to remain on\r\nthe Commission, and sailed from Manila on May 19 on the _Olympia_\r\nfor New York, _via_ Europe. The commissioners' inquiries into\r\neverything concerning the Islands, during their few months' sojourn,\r\nare embodied in a published report, dated December 20, 1900. [239]\r\nThe War of Independence was being waged during the whole time, and\r\nmilitary government, with full administrative powers, continued,\r\nas heretofore, until September 1, 1900. In the meantime the\r\nWashington Government resolved that military rule in the Islands\r\nshould be superseded by civil government. The pacified provinces,\r\nand those in conditions considered fit for civil administration,\r\nwere to be so established, and pending the conclusion of the war and\r\nthe subsidence of brigandage, the remainder of the Archipelago was\r\nto be administered as military districts. With this end in view,\r\non March 16, 1900, Judge William H. Taft [240] was commissioned\r\nto the Islands and sailed from San Francisco (Cal.) with his four\r\ncolleagues, on April 15, for Manila, where he arrived on June 3. In\r\nthe three months' interval, pending the assumption of legislative\r\npower, the Taft Commission was solely occupied in investigating\r\nconditions. To each commissioner certain subjects were assigned; for\r\nexample, Mr. Taft took up the Civil Service, Public Lands, and the\r\nFriar questions. Each commissioner held a kind of Court of Inquiry,\r\nbefore which voluntary evidence was taken. This testimony, later on,\r\nappeared in print, and its perusal shows how difficult indeed it must\r\nhave been for the Commission to have distinguished the true from\r\nthe false, the valuable from the trivial. It was the beginning of\r\nthe end of military rule in the Islands. \"The days of the Empire,\"\r\nas the military still designate that period, were numbered, and yet\r\nnot without regret by several native communities, as evidenced by the\r\nfact that they sent petitions to the authorities in Manila against\r\nthe change to civil government. Many law-abiding natives explained to\r\nme that the feature in military rule which particularly pleased them\r\nwas its prompt action--such a contrast to the only civil government\r\nof which they had had any experience. About two years later, in 1903,\r\nLieut.-Gen. Miles, Commander-in-Chief of the U.S. Army, made a tour in\r\nthe Islands and drew up a report on the conduct of military operations,\r\ncharging military officers with the grossest cruelty to the natives. A\r\nSenate Commission of Inquest was appointed, but it was quite impossible\r\nto prove anything conclusively on unimpeachable evidence; the general\r\nretired from his command without the blessing of his comrades, and\r\nthe matter was abated.\r\n\r\nThe Philippine Commission commenced its functions as the legislative\r\nbody, with limitary executive powers in addition, on September 1,\r\n1900, the military governor continuing as the Chief Executive until\r\nJuly 4, 1901. Up to that date the civil executive authority in the\r\norganized provinces was vested in the military governor. From that\r\ndate Maj.-General Adna R. Chaffee relieved Maj.-General McArthur in the\r\nsole capacity of commander-in-chief of the military division, the full\r\nexecutive civil power having been transferred to the Civil Commission,\r\nand thenceforth the Insular Government became constituted as it is at\r\npresent. Governor Taft pursued his investigations until February, 1901,\r\nwhen he started on a provincial tour, heard opinions, and tendered\r\nthe hand of peace. Municipalities united at certain centres to meet\r\nhim; the rich vied with each other to regale him royally; the crowd\r\nflocked in from all parts to greet him; the women smiled in their\r\ngala dresses; the men were obsequiousness itself; delicate viands\r\nwere placed before him, and, like every other intelligent traveller\r\nin these Islands, he was charmed by that distinguishing trait of the\r\nLuzon Islanders--that hospitality which has no parity elsewhere,\r\nand for which words cannot be found adequately to describe it to\r\nthe reader. As Governor Taft himself said truly, \"When a Filipino\r\nwho has a house says it is yours, he turns out his family and puts\r\nyou in.\" [241] Governor Taft's reception was only that which had\r\nbeen accorded to many a personage before his day, travelling in a\r\nstyle befitting his rank. He returned to Manila, captivated by the\r\nfascinating side of Philippine character: the reverse side he could\r\nnever know by personal experience, and the natives secured in him a\r\nchampion of their cause--\"Philippines for the Filipinos.\" The main\r\nobject of his official progress was to collect information for new\r\nlegislation anent the municipalities. Civil government was rapidly\r\nestablished in all the provinces which were peaceful and otherwise\r\nsuitable for it. The War of Independence was drawing to a close\r\n(April, 1902), and meanwhile Governor Taft made tours to Negros,\r\nCebu, and other islands to explain and inaugurate the new _regime_\r\nbased on President McKinley's Instructions to the Taft Commission,\r\ndated April 7, 1900. Governor Taft's administration was signalized\r\nby his complacency towards the natives, his frequent utterances\r\nfavourable to their aspirations, and his discouragement of those\r\nAmericans who sought to make quick fortunes and be gone. But there\r\nwere other Americans than these, and his favourite theme, \"Philippines\r\nfor the Filipinos,\" aroused unconcealed dissatisfaction among the\r\nmany immigrants, especially the ex-volunteers, who not unnaturally\r\nconsidered they had won a right to exploit, within reasonable bounds,\r\nthe \"new possession\" gained by conquest. Adverse critics contended that\r\nhe unduly protected the Filipino to the prejudice of the white man's\r\ninterest. Frank and unfettered encouragement of American enterprise\r\nwould surely have helped the professed policy of the State, which\r\nwas to lead the Filipinos to habits of industry; and how could this\r\nhave been more easily accomplished than by individual example? On\r\nthe other hand, the Filipinos, in conformity, regarded him as their\r\npatron: many were unconsciously drawn to submission by the suavity\r\nof his rule, whilst his courtesy towards the vanquished served as\r\nthe keynote to his countrymen to moderate their antipathy for the\r\nnative and remove the social barriers to a better understanding. And,\r\nin effect, his example did serve to promote a _rapprochement_ between\r\nthe conquerors and the conquered.\r\n\r\nAppointed to the Secretaryship of War, ex-Governor Taft left the\r\nPhilippines in January, 1904, to take up his new office, and was\r\nsucceeded in the presidency of the Philippine and Civil Commissions\r\nby Mr. Luke E. Wright. [242] On his way back to the United States\r\nex-Governor Taft was entertained by the Emperor of Japan, and on his\r\narrival in his native city of Cincinnati (Ohio) he made a remarkable\r\nspeech on the subject of the Philippines, the published reports of\r\nwhich contain the following significant passage:--\"The Filipinos\r\nelected the provincial governor and we appointed the treasurer. We\r\nwent there to teach the Filipinos honesty, and we appointed American\r\ntreasurers on the theory that the Americans could not steal. Never,\r\nnever have I suffered the humiliation that came to me when seventeen\r\nof our disbursing officers, treasurers, were found defaulters! They\r\nare now in Bilibid prison serving out their twenty-five years.\"\r\n\r\nSince then the Manila Press has recorded many cases of breach of\r\npublic trust by those who were sent to teach the Islanders how to\r\nrule themselves (_vide_ p. 493). The financial loss arising from\r\nmalfeasance on the part of any civil servant is made good to the\r\nTreasury by a Guarantee Society, which gives a bond in each case,\r\nwhilst it takes years to recover the consequent loss of prestige\r\nto the State. The obvious remedy for this state of things would\r\nbe the establishment in America of a Colonial Civil Service into\r\nwhich only youths would be admitted for training in the several\r\ndepartments. Progressive emolument, with the prospect of a long,\r\npermanent career and a pension at the end of it would be inducements\r\nto efficiency and moral stability.\r\n\r\nThe Philippine Civil Service is open to all United States citizens\r\nand Filipinos between the ages of 18 and 40 years in accordance with\r\nPhilippine Commission Act No. 5, known as the \"Civil Service Act,\"\r\npassed September 19, 1900. The service is divided into \"classified\"\r\nand \"unclassified.\" The former division is strictly subject to the\r\nprovisions of the above Act; the latter indicates the positions which\r\nmay be filled by appointment without subjection to the provisions of\r\nthe said Act. The Act declares its purpose to be \"the establishment\r\nand maintenance of an efficient and honest civil service in the\r\nPhilippine Islands.\" American soldiers who have less than six months\r\nto serve can apply for permission to be examined for the civil\r\nservice. The Act does not include examination for civil positions\r\nin the Military Division of the Islands, but the Civil Service Board\r\nis empowered to hold such examinations to fill vacancies as they may\r\noccur in the nine military departments which employ civilians. General\r\nexaminations, some in English only, others in Spanish only, or both,\r\nare held every Monday, and special examinations which include those\r\nfor scientific, professional, and technical positions are taken on\r\nspecified dates. The commencing salaries of the positions offered range\r\nfrom $1,200 downwards. Medical attendance is furnished gratis, and\r\nthe minimum working time is six and a half hours per day, except from\r\nApril 1 until June 15--the hottest weather--when the minimum working\r\nday is five hours. American women are employed in the Post Office.\r\n\r\nThe Civil Commission is located in the Walled City in the building\r\nwhich was formerly the Town Hall, a new Town Hall having been built\r\noutside the walls. Occasionally, when public interest is much aroused\r\non the subject of a proposed measure, the Commission announces\r\nthat a public conference will be held for the expression of opinion\r\nthereon. A few persons state their views before the Commissioners,\r\nwho rebut them _seance tenante_, and the measure, as proposed,\r\nusually becomes law, unless outside agitation and popular clamour\r\ninduce the Commissioners to modify it. At times the proceedings have\r\nbeen enlivened by sparkling humour. A worthy and patriotic Filipino\r\nonce gravely prefaced his speech thus:--\"I rise to speak, inspired\r\nby Divine Right\"--but he had to wait until the roars of laughter\r\nhad subsided. When the \"Sedition Act\" was being discussed, a less\r\nworthy auditor declared assassination of the Chief of a State to be\r\nmerely a political offence. He expected to go to prison and pose as\r\na martyr-patriot, but the Commission very rightly damped his ambition\r\nby declaring him to be a fool irresponsible for his acts.\r\n\r\nPhilippine Commission Acts are passed with great rapidity, amended\r\nand re-amended, sometimes several times, to the bewilderment of the\r\npublic. Out of 862 Acts passed up to the end of 1903, 686 of them\r\nwere amended (some five times) and on 782 no public discussion was\r\nallowed. The \"Internal Revenue Law of 1904\" had not been in force nine\r\nmonths when it was amended (March, 1905) by another law. By Philippine\r\nCommission Acts Nos. 127 and 128 the limits of the Surigao and Misamis\r\nprovinces were defined and afterwards upset by Act No. 787. The policy\r\nof the Americans anent the Philippines was continually shifting during\r\nthe first five years of their occupation, and only since ex-Governor\r\nTaft became Secretary of War does it seem to have assumed a somewhat\r\nmore stable character.\r\n\r\nThe Archipelago is divided into 41 provinces (exclusive of the Moro\r\nProvince, _vide_ p. 577), all under civil rule, in accordance with\r\nCongress Act of July 1, 1902, and War Office Order of July 4, 1902,\r\nwhereby the remainder of military government ceased. In June, 1904,\r\nnearly all the above 41 provinces had native governors with salaries\r\nranging from $3,000 gold downwards. In most of these provinces the\r\nnative governor and two American officials of about equal rank, such as\r\nthe Treasurer and the Supervisor, form a Provincial Council, but the\r\nmember who disagrees with the vote of the other two can appeal to the\r\nGov.-General. After the War of Independence several insurgent chiefs\r\nwere appointed to provincial governments; for instance, Cailles in La\r\nLaguna, Trias in Cavite, Climaco in Cebu, etc. For obvious reasons the\r\nsystem is advantageous. Juan Cailles, Governor of La Laguna, is the\r\nson of a Frenchman who married a native in one of the French colonies\r\nand then settled in these Islands. For some time Juan Cailles was\r\nregistered at the French Consulate as a French citizen. As commander of\r\nthe insurgents of La Laguna and Tayabas during the War of Independence,\r\nhe maintained strict discipline in his troops, and energetically drew\r\nthe line between legitimate warfare and common freebooting.\r\n\r\nThe provincial governor may be either elected or appointed by the\r\nCivil Commission. If he be a Filipino, he is usually elected by vote\r\nof the vice-presidents (ex-mayors) and municipal councillors of the\r\nprovince. The mayor of a municipality is styled \"Presidente.\" Every\r\nmale over twenty-three years of age who pays taxes amounting to 30\r\npesos, or who possesses 500 pesos' value of goods is eligible for\r\nelection by vote of the townspeople. He holds office for two years,\r\nbut can be re-elected for a consecutive term. The municipalities are\r\nof four classes according to their importance, the mayor's salary\r\nbeing as follows, viz.: First class, 1,200 pesos; second class, 1,000\r\npesos; third class, 800 pesos; and fourth class, 600 pesos. Provincial\r\njustices of the peace are paid by litigants' fees only. For municipal\r\nimprovements, or other urgent necessity, the Insular Government,\r\nfrom time to time, grants loans to municipalities, repayable with\r\ninterest. In some cases two or more towns have been wisely merged\r\ninto one municipality: for instance, Cauit, Salinas, and Novaleta\r\n(Cavite) go together; Baliuag, Bustos, and San Rafael (Bulacan) form\r\none; Barasoain and Malolos (Bulacan) are united; as are also Taal\r\nand Lemery (Batangas). By Philippine Commission Act No. 719 the 51\r\nmunicipalities of Yloilo Province were reduced to 17.\r\n\r\nMalolos is the new capital of Bulacan Province, and the two former\r\nprovinces of Camarines Norte and Camarines Sur are now one, under the\r\nname of Ambos Camarines. In the dependent wards of towns (_barrios_)\r\nthe municipal police are practically the only official representatives;\r\nthe post of lieutenant (_teniente de barrio_) is gratis and onerous,\r\nand few care to take it.\r\n\r\nThe _Guardia Civil_ or Rural Guard of Spanish times has been\r\nsuperseded by the _Philippine Constabulary_ under the supreme and\r\nindependent command of a cavalry captain (U.S.A.) holding local rank\r\nof Brig.-General. In the private opinion of many regular army officers,\r\nthis force ought to be under the control of the Division Commander. The\r\nofficers are American, European, and Philippine. The privates are\r\nFilipinos, and the whole force is about 7,000 strong. The function\r\nof this body is to maintain order in rural districts. For some time\r\nthere were cases of batches of the rank-and-file passing over to the\r\nbrigands whom they were sent to disperse or capture. However, this\r\ndisturbing element has been gradually eliminated, and the Philippine\r\nConstabulary has since performed very useful service. Nevertheless,\r\nmany educated natives desire its improvement or suppression, on\r\naccount of the alleged abuse of functions to the prejudice of peaceful\r\ninhabitants (_vide_ p. 550).\r\n\r\nCo-operating with municipal police and the Philippine Constabulary\r\nthere is an organized Secret Police Service. It is a heterogeneous\r\nband of many nationalities, including Asiatics, which, as an\r\n_executive_ force to investigate crimes known to have been committed,\r\nrenders good service; as an _initiative_ force, with power, with or\r\nwithout authority, to molest peaceful citizens in quest of imaginary\r\nmisdemeanours, in order to justify the necessity of its employment,\r\nit is an unwelcome institution to all, especially the lower-middle\r\nand common classes, amongst whom it can operate with greater impunity.\r\n\r\nNot unfrequently when a European nation acquires a new tropical\r\npossession, the imaginative mind discovers therein unbounded wealth\r\nwhich the eye cannot see, hidden stores of gold procurable only by\r\nmanual labour, and fortune-making possibilities awaiting whosoever\r\nhas the courage to reveal them. The propagation of these fallacious\r\nnotions always allures to the new territory a crowd of ne'er-do-wells,\r\namongst the _bona fide_ workers, who ultimately become loafers preying\r\nupon the generosity of the toilers. This class was not wanting in\r\nthe Philippines; some had followed the army; others who had finished\r\ntheir term of voluntary military service elected to remain in the\r\nvisionary El Dorado. Some surreptitiously opened drinking-shanties;\r\nothers exploited feminine frailty or eked out an existence by\r\nbeggarly imposition, and it was stated by a provincial governor that,\r\nto his knowledge, at one time, there were 80 of this class in his\r\nprovince. [243] The number of undesirables was so great that it became\r\nnecessary for the Insular Government to pass a Vagrant Act, under\r\nwhich the loafer could be arrested and disposed of. The Act declares\r\nvagrancy to be a misdemeanour, and provides penalties therefor; but\r\nit has always been interpreted in a generous spirit of pity for the\r\ndelinquent, to whom the option of a free passage home or imprisonment\r\nwas given, generally resulting in his quitting the Islands. This\r\nmeasure, which brought honour to its devisers and relief to society,\r\nwas, in a few instances, abused by those who feigned to be vagrants\r\nin order to secure the passage home, but these were judiciously dealt\r\nwith by a regulation imposing upon them a short period of previous\r\ntraining in stone-breaking to fit them for active life in the homeland.\r\n\r\nThe following General Order was issued by the Division Commander in\r\nJanuary, 1905, viz.:--\r\n\r\n    It is reported by the Civil Governor that in several places in\r\n    Luzon there have gathered numbers of dishonourably discharged men\r\n    from the army who are a hindrance to progress and good order. The\r\n    Division Commander desires that in future no dishonourably\r\n    discharged soldiers be allowed to remain in the Islands, where\r\n    their presence is very undesirable. It is therefore directed that,\r\n    in acting on cases where the sentence is dishonourable discharge\r\n    without confinement, the dishonourable discharge be made to take\r\n    effect after arrival in San Francisco, where the men so discharged\r\n    should be sent by first transport.\r\n\r\nThe Philippine Archipelago is a military division under the supreme\r\ncommand of a Maj.-General. The commanders, since the taking of Manila\r\n(1898), have been successively Maj.-Generals Merritt, Otis, McArthur,\r\nChaffee, Davis, Wade, Corbin, and Wood.\r\n\r\nThe Division is administratively subdivided into three departments,\r\nnamely Luzon, Visayas, and Mindanao, the two former being commanded\r\nby Brig.-Generals and the last by a Maj.-General.\r\n\r\nThe _Department of Luzon_, headquarters at Manila, includes the\r\nfollowing principal islands, viz. Luzon, Catanduanes, Romblon,\r\nMasbate, Marinduque, Mindoro, Sibuyan, Polillo, Ticao, Tablas, Lucbang,\r\nand Burias.\r\n\r\nThe _Department of Visayas_, headquarters at Yloilo, embraces the\r\nislands of Cebu, Negros, Panay, Leyte, Samar, and Bojol.\r\n\r\nThe _Department of Mindanao_, headquarters at Zamboanga, includes\r\nall the remaining islands of the Philippine Archipelago.\r\n\r\n\r\n    STATEMENT OF ARMY STRENGTH IN THE PHILIPPINES ON JUNE 30, 1904 [244]\r\n\r\n                    Present             Absent              Present and Absent\r\n                    Officers.

Until recently the troops were\r\nstationed over the Islands in 98 camps and garrison towns, as follows,\r\nviz.:--In the Department of Luzon 76, Visayas 8, and Mindanao 14;\r\nbut this number is now considered unnecessarily large and is being\r\nreduced to effect economy.\r\n\r\nThe Army, Navy, and Philippine Scouts expenses are entirely defrayed\r\nby the United States Treasury. A military prison is established in\r\nthe little Island of Malahi, in the Laguna de Bay, whence the escape\r\nof a prisoner is signalled by three shots from a cannon, and whoever\r\ncaptures him receives a $30-reward. As the original notice to this\r\neffect required the recovery of the prisoner \"alive or dead,\" two armed\r\nnatives went in pursuit of an American soldier. To be quite sure of\r\ntheir prey they adopted the safe course of killing him first. Such an\r\nunexpected interpretation of the notice as the grim spectacle of an\r\nAmerican's head was naturally repugnant to the authorities, and the\r\n\"alive or dead\" condition was thenceforth expunged.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXIX\r\n\r\nThe Land of the Moros\r\n\"Allah Akbar!\"\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Military Department of Mindanao comprises the large island of\r\nthat name and the adjacent insular territories inhabited chiefly by\r\nMahometans, called by the Christians _Moros_ (_vide_ p. 129, et seq.).\r\n\r\nThe natural features of these southern islands are, in general,\r\nsimilar to those of the other large islands of the Archipelago,\r\nbut being peopled by races (exclusive of the settlers) of different\r\nhabits, customs, religions, and languages, some aggressively savage\r\nand warlike, others more or less tractable, but all semi-civilized,\r\nthe social aspect is so distinct from that of the islands inhabited\r\nby the Christian Filipinos as almost to appear like another quarter\r\nof the tropical globe.\r\n\r\nEarly in the year 1899 General John C. Bates was appointed to the\r\ncommand of the Mahometan islands. In Mindanao Island there was no\r\nsupreme chieftain with whom to treat for the gradual introduction\r\nof civilization and American methods, the whole territory being\r\nparcelled out and ruled by petty Sultans, _Dattos_ or chiefs,\r\nin separate independence. In the Lake Lanao district, for instance,\r\nthere is at least one _Datto_ for every 50 men. The only individual who\r\nhad any pretence to general control of the Mahometan population was\r\nHadji [246] Mohammad Jamalul Kiram, the Sultan of Sulu [247] (_vide_\r\np. 141). Therefore, in August, 1899, General Bates and this petty\r\nprince made an agreement which was ratified by Congress on February\r\n1 following, on the recommendation of the Schurman Commission (_vide_\r\np. 562), and thenceforth came into force. The principal conditions of\r\nthis convention were: (1) The Sultan's dignity and certain monopoly\r\nrights were recognized under American suzerainty. (2) An annual pension\r\nof 3,000 pesos was secured to him, and annual salaries ranging from\r\n180 to 900 pesos were to be paid to eight of his _Dattos_ and one\r\npriest. (3) A Moro accused of crime was to be tried by a Moro judge,\r\nthe maximum penalty for murder being fixed at 105 pesos (equal to\r\nabout ten guineas), which was a fair price in this region, from the\r\nMoro point of view, for life here is held very cheap. (4) Absconding\r\nAmericans or Sulus were to be mutually surrendered. (5) The Americans\r\nwere (_a_) to protect the Sultan against encroachments by foreigners\r\nor European nations; (_b_) not to take arms against the Sulus without\r\nconsulting the Sultan; (_c_) not to transfer their dominion over Jolo\r\nto others except in agreement with the Sultan; (_d_) to be at liberty\r\nto occupy any place in the Sultan's domains without trespassing on\r\nlands about the royal residence, except as a military necessity of\r\nwar with a foreign Power; (_e_) not to interfere with the Mahometan\r\nreligion, or its rites, or its customs; (_f_) not to travel about\r\nSulu Island without the permission of the Sultan, who would provide an\r\nescort. (6) The American flag was to be used on land and at sea. (7)\r\nThe Sulus were to be free to carry their native arms. (8) The Sultan\r\nwas at liberty to collect tribute everywhere in his domains, and to\r\nhave the right of direct intercourse with the American Gov.-General.\r\n\r\nIn consideration of the above, the Sultan undertook to maintain order\r\nbetween his _Dattos_, to repress internecine warfare, and gradually\r\nto abolish slavery throughout his jurisdiction.\r\n\r\nApparently the Sultan entered into the agreement much in the spirit\r\nof Mr. Micawber, who signed the I.O.U.'s and thanked God his\r\ndebts were paid. The ruler of Sulu was not over-willing and far\r\nless able to give effect to its conditions, his power being more\r\nnominal than real in his own possessions, and in Mindanao almost\r\n_nil_. Nevertheless, it was a politic measure on the Americans'\r\npart, because its non-fulfilment opened the way for the adoption,\r\nwith every appearance of justification, of more direct and coercive\r\nintervention in the affairs of this region. General Bates was\r\nsucceeded by other generals in the command of this district, without\r\nany very visible progress towards definite pacification and subjection\r\nto civilization. The military posts on the coasts, evacuated by the\r\nSpaniards, were occupied by American troops and new ones were created,\r\nbut every attempt to establish law and order beyond their limits, on\r\nthe white man's system, was wasted effort. When the Spanish-American\r\nWar broke out, the Spanish military authorities were on the point\r\nof maturing a plan for the final conquest of Mindanao. Due to the\r\npersistent activity of my old friend General Gonzalez Parrado, they\r\nhad already achieved much in the Lake Lanao district, through the\r\nMarahui campaign. On the evacuation of the Spaniards the unrestrained\r\npetty chiefs were like lions released from captivity. Blood-shed,\r\noppression, extortion, and all the instinctive habits of the shrewd\r\nsavage were again rife. A preconcerted plan of campaign brings little\r\ndefinite result; it never culminates in the attainment of any final\r\nissue, for, on the native side, there is neither union of tribes nor\r\nany combined organized attempt at even guerilla warfare, hence the\r\ndestruction of a _cotta_ or the decimation of a clan has no immediate\r\nand lasting moral effect on the neighbouring warlike tribe. Life is\r\ncheap among them; a Moro thinks no more about lopping off another's\r\nhead than he does about pulling a cocoanut from the palm-tree. The\r\nchief abhors the white man because he interferes with the chief's\r\nliving by the labour of his tribe, and the tribesman himself is\r\ntoo ignorant even to contemplate emancipation. Subservience to the\r\nbidding of the wily _Datto_, poverty, squalidity, and tribal warfare\r\nfor bravado or interest seem as natural to the Moro as the sight of\r\nthe rising sun. Hence, when the Americans resolved to change all this\r\nand marched into the tribal territories for the purpose, the war-gongs\r\nrallied the fighting-men to resist the dreaded foe, unconscious of\r\nhis mission of liberty under the star-spangled banner. The sorrows\r\nor the joys of one tribe are no concern of the other; thus there was\r\nseldom, if ever, any large combination of forces, and the Americans\r\nmight be fighting hard in the Taraca country, or around the Lanao\r\nLake, whilst the neighbouring clan silently and doggedly awaited its\r\nturn for hostilities. The signal for the fray would be the defiant\r\nreply of a chief to the Americans' message demanding submission, or a\r\nvoluntary throwing down of the gauntlet to the invader, for the Moro\r\nis valiant, and knows no cringing cowardice before the enemy. Troops\r\nwould be despatched to the _cotta_, or fortress, of the recalcitrant\r\nruler, whence the _lantaca_ cannon would come into action, whilst the\r\nsurging mob of warriors would open fire in squads, or rush forward\r\nin a body, _barong_ or kris in hand, only to be mown down, or put to\r\nflight and the _cotta_ razed to the ground. A detailed account of the\r\nmilitary operations in these islands would be but a tedious recital of\r\ncontinuous struggles with the irresistible white man. In Mindanao, the\r\nMalanao tribes, occupying the northern regions around the Lake Lanao\r\ndistricts, seem to have offered the most tenacious resistance. On\r\nApril 5, 1902, a fierce encounter with the Bacolod tribes ended\r\nwith their fort being destroyed, 120 Moros killed, and 11 Americans\r\nwounded. In the following month the bloody battle of Bayan brought\r\nsuch disastrous results to the natives that they willingly accepted\r\npeace for the time being. In the Taraca River engagement, 10 _cottas_\r\nwere destroyed, 250 Moros were killed, 52 were taken prisoners, and\r\nthe booty amounted to 36 cannon and 60 rifles. The Moros possessed a\r\nlarge number of Remington rifles, looted from the Spaniards, on whom\r\nthey had often made surprise raids. The Bacolod and the Taraca tribes,\r\nalthough frequently defeated, gave much trouble long after the other\r\ndistricts had been forced into submission.\r\n\r\nOne of the most exciting expeditions was that of Lieutenant Forsyth,\r\nwho went out reconnoitring with 15 men, marching from Parang-Parang\r\nCamp northwards. Moros came to meet him on the way to warn him not to\r\nadvance, but Forsyth bravely pushed on until his party, surrounded\r\nby hundreds of hostile natives, was almost all destroyed. Forsyth\r\nand his fellow-survivors fled into an unknown region, where they\r\nlost themselves, and all would have perished had they not been\r\nbefriended by a _Datto_ who enabled them to get back. Then Colonel\r\n(now Brig.-General) F. D. Baldwin set out from Malabang Camp in\r\nMay, attacked and captured the _cottas_ of the Datto of Binadayan\r\nand the Sultan of Bayan on Lake Lanao, and gained a signal victory\r\nover them with a loss of seven killed and 44 wounded. Lieutenant\r\nForsyth's horses and rifles were recovered, and the Moros suffered\r\nso severely in this engagement that it was hardly thought they would\r\nrise again. In consequence of this humiliation of the great Sultan\r\nof Bayan, many minor Lake _Dattos_ voluntarily cultivated friendly\r\nrelations with the Americans. Even among the recalcitrant chiefs there\r\nwas a lull in their previous activity until they suddenly swept down\r\non the American troops twelve times in succession, killing four and\r\nwounding 12 of them. The whole Lanao Lake district was in a ferment\r\nwhen, on September 28, 1902, Captain John J. Pershing was detached\r\nfrom Baldwin's force to lead another expedition against them \"composed\r\nof a battalion of the 7th Infantry, a troop of the 15th Cavalry, and\r\ntwo platoons of the 25th Field Artillery.\" [248] Pershing inflicted\r\nsuch a crushing defeat on the Macui Moros, destroying many of their\r\nstrongholds, one Sultan and a large number of his warriors, that he\r\nwas hailed with delight as the pacifier of Mindanao. The expedition\r\nreturned with a total loss of only two Americans wounded, and after\r\nPershing's heroic exploit, not only was it in the mouth of every one,\r\n\"there is peace in Mindanao,\" but in the Report of the Secretary of\r\nWar for 1902, p. 19, there is a paragraph beginning thus:--\"_Now that\r\nthe insurrection has been disposed of_ we shall be able to turn our\r\nattention, not merely to the slave trade, but to the already existing\r\nslavery among the Moros.\" But peace was by no means assured, and\r\nagain Captain J. J. Pershing distinguished himself as the successful\r\nleader of an expedition in the Marahui district. Starting from Camp\r\nVicars [249] on April 5, 1903, with 150 men, Maxim guns, mortars, and\r\nartillery, his instructions were to \"explore\" the north and west coast\r\nof Lake Lanao, but to overcome any opposition offered. It was quite\r\nexpected that his progress would be challenged, hence the warlike\r\npreparations. Arrived at Sugud, the Moros kept up a constant fire\r\nfrom the hills on the American front. On the high ridge running down\r\nto the lake the Bacolod fort was clearly seen flying the battle flags\r\nof defiance. On the battlements there was a yelling crowd of Moros\r\nbeating their gongs, rushing to and fro, flourishing their weapons,\r\nand firing their _lantaca_ cannon towards the Americans; but the\r\nrange was too great to have any effect. The artillery was brought into\r\naction, forcing many of the Moros to try their fortunes in the open;\r\nbut again and again they were repulsed, and by nightfall the Bacolod\r\nridge was occupied by the troops. The next morning the mortars were\r\nbrought into play, and shells were dropped into the fort during all\r\nthat day and night. On the third day Captain Pershing decided to storm\r\nthe fort; bridges were constructed across the ravines, Maxim guns\r\npoured shot through the loopholes, and finally an assault party of\r\n10 men rushed across the bridge and climbed the parapet, where they\r\nwere met by the Moros, with whom they had a desperate hand-to-hand\r\nfight. It was a fine display of American pluck. The attacking party\r\nwas quickly supported by more troops, who either killed or captured\r\nthe defenders. Finally all the combustible portion of the fort was\r\nburnt to the ground, 12 cannon were captured, and about 60 Moros\r\nwere slain. The demolition of Bacolod fort was a great surprise to\r\nthe Moros, who had considered it impregnable, whilst the defeat of\r\nthe savage Sultan (the _Panandungan_) destroyed for ever his former\r\nunlimited prestige among the tribe. The force was then divided, and\r\nbefore the troops reached camp again there were several smaller fights,\r\nincluding the bombardment of Calahui _cotta_. The distance traversed by\r\nthis expedition was about 80 miles, the American losses being one man\r\nkilled and two officers and 14 men wounded. For this signal victory the\r\nWar Department cabled its thanks to Captain J. J. Pershing on May 11.\r\n\r\nAs to the management of the Moros, Captain J. J. Pershing expresses\r\nthe following just opinion, viz.:--\"As far as is consistent with\r\nadvancement, a government by a Sultan, or a _Datto_, as the case may\r\nbe, should be disturbed as little as possible; that is, the people\r\nshould be managed through the _Dattos_ themselves,\" etc. [250]\r\n\r\nThe last general in command of the District of Mindanao, prior to the\r\npresent constitution of the Moro Province, was Brig.-General Samuel\r\nSumner, who, just before his departure therefrom, wrote as follows,\r\nviz.:--\"Murder and robbery will take place as long as we are in the\r\ncountry, at least for years to come. The Moro is a savage, and has no\r\nidea of law and order _as we understand it_. _Anarchy_ practically\r\nprevails throughout the region. To take power and control away from\r\nthe Sultans and _Dattos_ until we can inaugurate and put in force a\r\nbetter government would add to the confusion already existing.\" [251]\r\n\r\nThe instructions of the President of the United States to the\r\nPhilippine Commission, dated April 7, 1900, direct as follows,\r\nviz.:--\"In dealing with the uncivilized tribes of the Islands the\r\nCommission shall adopt the same course followed by Congress in\r\npermitting the tribes of our North American Indians to maintain\r\ntheir tribal organizations and government, and under which many of\r\nthose tribes are now living in peace and contentment, surrounded by\r\na civilization to which they are unable or unwilling to conform.\"\r\n\r\nFrom the American point of view, but not from the Moro way of looking\r\nat things, an apparent state of anarchy prevailed everywhere; but the\r\nSultans and the _Dattos_ took very good care not to tolerate what,\r\nin Europe, one would term anarchy, tending to subvert the local\r\nrule. There is no written code of Moro justice. If a Moro stole a\r\nbuffalo from another, and the case were brought before the judge,\r\nthis functionary and the local chief would, by custom, expect to make\r\nsome profit for themselves out of the dispute. The thief would have\r\nto pay a fine to the headman or go into slavery, but having no money\r\nhe would have to steal it to purchase his freedom. The buffalo being\r\nthe object of dispute would be confiscated, and to be even with the\r\ndefendant for the loss of the buffalo, the plantiff would lop off\r\nthe defendant's head if he were a man of means and could afford to\r\npay 105 pesos fine for his revenge.\r\n\r\nThe real difficulty was, and still is, that there is no Sultan,\r\nor _Datto_, of very extended authority to lay hold of and subdue,\r\nand whose defeat or surrender would entail the submission of a whole\r\ndistrict or tribe. The work of subjection has to be performed piecemeal\r\namong the hundreds of _Dattos_, each of whom, by established custom,\r\ncan only act for himself and his own retainers, for every _Datto_ would\r\nresent, at the risk of his life, any dictation from another. All this\r\nis extremely irritating to the white commander, who would prefer to\r\nbring matters to a definite crisis by one or more decisive contests,\r\nimpossible of realization, however, in Mindanao or Sulu Islands.\r\n\r\nSuch was the condition of affairs in the southern extremity of\r\nthe Archipelago when it was decided to appoint a Maj.-General to\r\ncommand it and create a semi-independent government for its local\r\nadministration. Maj.-General Leonard Wood [252] was happily chosen for\r\nthis arduous and delicate task, and on July 25, 1903, he took up his\r\nappointment, holding it for about two years, when he was transferred\r\nto Manila to command the Division in succession to Maj.-General Henry\r\nC. Corbin.\r\n\r\nThis region, now called the _Moro Province_, was established under\r\nPhilippine Commission Act No. 787 of June 1, 1903 (which came into\r\neffect on July 15 following), and includes all Mindanao [253] except\r\nthe larger portion of Misamis Province and all Surigao Province\r\n(N. and E.), which are under civil government, [254] the Jolo (Sulu)\r\nArchipelago, the Tawi Tawi group, and all the islands south of Lat. 8 deg.\r\nN., excepting therefrom Palauan (Paragua) and Balabac Islands and\r\nthe islands immediately adjacent thereto, but including the Island\r\nof Cagayan de Jolo. The seat of government is at Zamboanga, the\r\nheadquarters of the military district, whose commander (Maj.-General\r\nWood) acted in the dual capacity (but not _ex-officio_) of military\r\ncommander and President of the Legislative Council of the Moro\r\nProvince, which was organized September 2, 1903, and is composed as\r\nfollows, viz.:--\r\n\r\n\r\n    Legislative Council                         Emolument\r\n\r\n    President, the Provincial Governor          $6,000 gold (if he be\r\n                                                a civilian). [255]\r\n    Provincial Secretary                        Not exceeding\r\n    Provincial Treasurer                        $4,000 gold\r\n    Provincial Attorney\r\n    Provincial Superintendent of Schools\r\n    Provincial Engineer\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Council has power to enact laws \"by authority of and subject to\r\nannulment or amendment by the Philippine Commission,\" and four members\r\nof the six constitute a quorum for legislative action. The Provincial\r\nGovernor is responsible, and must report from time to time to the\r\nGov.-General of the Philippines. The province is sub-divided into\r\nfive governmental districts, and one sub-district under governors\r\nand lieut.-governor respectively. [256]\r\n\r\n\r\n    Districts                                  Emolument of Governor\r\n\r\n    Zamboanga   (including Basilan Is.)\r\n    Jolo (sulu) (including Tawi Tawi group)\r\n    Lanao (including Yligan and Lake Lanao)    Not exceeding $3,500\r\n    Cottabato (including Polloc)               gold if he be a civilian.\r\n    Davao (including Catil)\r\n\r\n    Dapitan (a sub-district of Zamboanga)      Not exceeding $2,000\r\n                                               gold, if he be a civilian.\r\n\r\n\r\nEach district is controlled by a District Council composed of the\r\ngovernor, the secretary, and the treasurer. At present all the district\r\ngovernors are army officers.\r\n\r\nSection 15 of the above Act No. 787 provides that governors and\r\nsecretaries of districts must learn and pass an examination in the\r\ndialects of their localities within 18 months after taking office,\r\nor be subject to dismissal.\r\n\r\nUnder Philippine Commission Act No. 82, entitled \"The Municipal Code,\"\r\namended in its application to the Moro Province by the Legislative\r\nCouncil of the Moro Province Act No. 35, of January 27, 1904, the\r\nMoro districts and sub-districts are furthermore sub-divided in the\r\nfollowing manner, viz.:--\r\n\r\n_Municipalities_ are established in the district or sub-district\r\ncapital towns, and wherever there is a population sufficiently large\r\nand enlightened to be entitled to municipal rights. [257] A president\r\n(mayor), vice-president, or councillor must be between twenty-six\r\nand sixty-five years of age, and must intelligently speak, read, and\r\nwrite Spanish, English, or the principal local dialect. Ecclesiastics,\r\nsoldiers in active service, and persons receiving emolument from\r\npublic funds are debarred from these offices. Every municipal officer\r\nmust give a bond with two or more sureties equal to at least half\r\nof the amount of annual funds which will probably pass through his\r\nhands. The maximum salary of a president (mayor) is P1,200, and that\r\nof municipal secretary P600. Certain other officers are also paid,\r\nbut the vice-presidency and councillorships are honorary posts. A\r\nperson elected to office by the people is not permitted to decline it,\r\nexcept for certain reasons defined in the code, subject to a maximum\r\npenalty of six months' imprisonment. The mayor's symbol of office is\r\na cane with a silver knob, plated ferrule, and black cord and tassels.\r\n\r\nNatives whose habits and social condition will not yet permit their\r\ninclusion in a municipality are segregated into _Tribal Wards_ [258]\r\n(Legislative Council Act No. 39, of February 19, 1904). The headman\r\nis generally the chief recognized by his race or people as such,\r\nand is immediately responsible to the district governor by whom\r\nhe is appointed. His annual salary ranges from P240 to P1,800, and\r\nhis badge of office is a baldric of red leather with a metal disc,\r\nbearing an impression of the Moro Province seal. He and his advisory\r\ncouncil perform the usual municipal functions on a minor scale, and\r\nare permitted to \"conform to the local customs of the inhabitants,\r\nunless such customs are contrary to law or repugnant to the usages\r\nor moral sense of civilized peoples.\"\r\n\r\nA Tribal Ward is furthermore divided into _Tribal Ward Districts_. The\r\ndistrict headman is the deputy of the tribal ward headman to whom he\r\nis immediately responsible. His annual salary ranges from P96 to P600,\r\nand his badge of office is a baldric of yellow canvas with a metal\r\ndisc as mentioned above. The tribal ward headman's district deputies\r\ntogether constitute the police force of the whole ward. Tribal ward\r\nheadmen and their district deputies are not required to give bond. At\r\nany time, on certain conditions, a member of a tribal ward can apply\r\nfor full citizenship in a municipality. In short, the governmental\r\nsystem adopted is intended to raise the native progressively from\r\nsavagery to municipal life.\r\n\r\nThe sources of _Revenue_ are briefly as follows, viz:--\r\n\r\n_Provincial._--Property tax (7/8 per cent. of assessed value),\r\nindustrial, cedula (poll tax of 1 peso for each male over 18 years),\r\nstamps, court fees, fines, sales of supplies to municipalities,\r\nand forestry collection.\r\n\r\n_Municipal._--Ownership and transfer of cattle, rents and profits,\r\nlicences, fines and carts.\r\n\r\n_Customs Revenues_ in the five ports of entry, viz.:--Jolo, Zamboanga,\r\nCottabato, Siassi, and Bongao.\r\n\r\nThe Summary of the fiscal year ending June 30, 1904, stands thus:--\r\n\r\n\r\n    Revenue\r\n\r\n    Provincial Taxes and Forestry payments          P114,713.66\r\n    Customs Revenue                                  222,664.39\r\n                                                     ----------\r\n                                                    P337,378.05\r\n\r\n    Expenditure\r\n\r\n    Provincial                                      P174,361.70\r\n    Appropriated for Public Works                     26,181.76\r\n    Customs Expenses                                  53,170.62\r\n    Balance available                                 83,663.97\r\n                                                     ----------\r\n                                                    P337,378.05\r\n\r\n\r\nThe maintenance of the Constabulary Force, Post Office Department,\r\nand Courts of First Instance in this Province is an Insular Government\r\ncharge.\r\n\r\nThe revenue collected within the province (including the customs\r\nreceipts) is spent therein. No remittance of funds is made to the\r\nInsular Treasury, but provincial accounts are subject to Insular\r\nGovernment audit, and have to be rendered to Manila.\r\n\r\nThe troops assigned to this command are as follows, viz. [259]:--\r\n\r\n\r\nArmed Forces in the Moro Province.              Present and Absent.\r\n                                                Officers.   Troops.\r\n\r\nRegular troops [260]                                236     3,766\r\nContract and Dental  Surgeons and attached Staff     25       --\r\nTotal American forces                               261     3,766\r\nNative troops                                        11       543\r\n\r\nTotal Strength, Military District                   272     4,309\r\nPhilippine Constabulary (Moro and Christian mixed)\r\n    under Civil Government orders                    22       530\r\n                                                    ---     -----\r\n                                                    294     4,839\r\n\r\n\r\nOn General Wood's recommendation, the Bates Agreement (_vide_\r\np. 571) was rescinded on the ground that it was an obstacle to\r\ngood government. In truth, the Sultan of Sulu was probably quite\r\nas unable as he was unwilling to carry out its provisions. However,\r\nunder Philippine Commission Act No. 1259 (amended by Act No. 1320 of\r\nApril 12, 1905), certain small annual money allowances are made to\r\nthe present Sultan of Sulu and his principal advisers.\r\n\r\nIn Mindanao, trouble again arose on the east shore of Lake Lanao,\r\nand an expedition was organized to march against the Taracas, who\r\nwere, however, only temporarily subdued. Defiant messages were sent\r\nby the _Dattos_, and General Wood decided to conduct operations in\r\nperson. According to private information given to me by officers\r\nin Mindanao some months after the battle, immense slaughter was\r\ninflicted on this tribe, whose _cottas_ were annihilated, and they were\r\nutterly crushed for the time being. About the beginning of 1904 the\r\ndepredations of the Moros in the upper valley of the Cottabato River\r\nwere revolting beyond all toleration. Cottabato town was pillaged under\r\nthe leadership of Datto Ali and of his brother, Datto Djimbangan. In\r\nMarch an expedition invested the Serenaya territory in the Cottabato\r\ndistrict and operated from the 4th to the 14th of that month without\r\nany American casualties. Datto Ali's fort at Kudarangan was taken and\r\ndestroyed. [261] This formidable stronghold is described by General\r\nWood thus:--\"It was larger than twenty of the largest _cottas_ of the\r\nLake region or Sulu, and would have easily held a garrison of four or\r\nfive thousand men. It was well located, well built, well armed, and\r\namply supplied with ammunition. There were embrasures for 120 pieces\r\nof artillery. Eighty-five pieces were captured, among them many large\r\ncannon of from 3 inches to 5 1/2 inches calibre. The other pieces in\r\nthe work, small _lantacas_, were carried off or thrown into the river\"\r\n(_vide_ First Annual Report of the Moro Province).\r\n\r\nDatto Ali thenceforth became a fugitive with some 60 armed followers\r\nand about a hundred others whom he pressed into his service as\r\ncarriers. After the battle, Datto Djimbangan, Ali's brother, was\r\ntaken unawares at his ranche by a detachment of American troops. He\r\nwas conducted as a prisoner to Cottabato, and in February, 1905, he\r\nwas transferred to the Zamboanga jail to await his trial for sedition\r\nand rebellion. Again the Taracas ventured on a series of attacks on\r\nthe American military posts in the locality. A body of troops was\r\ndespatched there in March, and after ten days' operations this tribe\r\nwas routed and dispersed, the American casualties being two men killed,\r\none drowned, 10 wounded, and one officer slightly wounded. On May\r\n8 a party of 39 men and two officers, reconnoitring about Simbalan,\r\nup the Cottabato Valley, was attacked, 13 men being killed, two taken\r\nprisoners, six wounded, and the two officers killed. It would appear\r\nthat the guides were conducting the party safely, when a lieutenant\r\ninsisted on taking another route and landed his troops in a plateau\r\ncovered with _cogon_ (pampas-grass) about eight feet high. On emerging\r\nfrom this they all got into a stream, where the Moros suddenly fell\r\nupon them. The punitive Simpetan Expedition immediately set out for\r\nthat district and successfully operated from the 13th to the 28th\r\nof May without any American casualties. Datto Ali, who was again\r\non the warpath, is the son-in-law of old Datto Piang, the terror\r\nof the neighbourhood in his younger days and also just after the\r\nevacuation by the Spaniards. Ali declared that he would not yield to\r\nthe Americans one iota of his independence, or liberate his slaves, and\r\nswore vengeance on all who went in his pursuit. Being the hereditary\r\n_Datto_, the inhabitants of the valley generally sympathized with him,\r\nat least passively. In the latter half of 1904, constant endeavour\r\nwas made to effect the capture of this chieftain, whilst old Datto\r\nPiang, the son of a Chinaman with a keen eye to business, supplied\r\nthe Americans with baggage-carriers at a peso a day per man for the\r\ntroops sent to hunt down his refractory son-in-law. Active operations\r\nwere sustained against him, and from the military posts of Malabang\r\n(formerly a Moro slave-market) and Parang-Parang on the Illana Bay\r\ncoast there were continually small punitive parties scouring the\r\ndistrict here and there. At the former camp I was the guest of the\r\ngenial Colonel Philip Reade, in command of the 23rd Infantry, when\r\nLieutenant C. R. Lewis was brought in wounded from a Cottabato River\r\nsortie. Colonel Reade, whose regiment had had about the roughest\r\nwork of any in the Island, had certainly inspired his men with the\r\nnever-know-when-you-are-beaten spirit, for the report of a reverse\r\nset them all longing to be the chosen ones for the next party. But\r\nup to July, 1905, Datto Ali had been able to elude capture, although\r\nGeneral Wood personally conducted operations against him a year before,\r\nestablishing his headquarters at Cabacsalan, near the Lake Ligusan.\r\n\r\nThe most ferocious and arrogant Mindanao tribes occupy regions within\r\neasy access of the coast. Perhaps their character is due to their\r\nhaving led more adventurous lives by land and sea for generations,\r\nplundering the tribes of the interior and making slave raids in\r\ntheir _vintas_ on the northern islands and christian native coast\r\nsettlements. In the centre of the Island and around the mountainous\r\nregion of the Apo the tribes are more peaceful and submissive, without\r\ndesire or means for warfare. Many of the Bagobo tribe (which I have\r\ntwice visited), in the neighbourhood of Davao, have come down to\r\nsettle in villages under American protection, paying only an occasional\r\nvisit to their tribal territory to make a human sacrifice.\r\n\r\nIn Basilan Island, a dependency of Zamboanga, about 13 miles distant,\r\nDatto Pedro Cuevas accepted the new situation, and under his influence\r\npeace was assured among the large Moro population of that island. The\r\nhistory of this man's career bristles with stirring episodes. Born in\r\n1845, of Tagalog parentage, he started life as a Cavite highwayman,\r\nbut was captured and deported to the agricultural colony of San\r\nRamon, near Zamboanga, where he, with other convicts, attacked and\r\nkilled three of the European overseers, and Cuevas escaped to Basilan\r\nIsland. After innumerable difficulties, involving the conquest of a\r\nscore of villages, he gained the control of a large number of Yacan\r\nMoros and became a sort of chief. Some years afterwards the Moros\r\norganized an attack on the Christians at Zamboanga and Isabela de\r\nBasilan, and Cuevas offered to save the Spaniards on condition of\r\nreceiving a full pardon. Two Spaniards were accordingly sent as\r\nhostages to Cuevas' camp, and after Isabela was freed of the enemy\r\nhe came to see the Spanish governor. There were several Spaniards\r\npresent at the interview, and it is related that one of them let\r\nslip a phrase implying doubt as to Cuevas' worthiness for pardon,\r\nwhereupon the undaunted chief remarked, \"Sir, I thought I had won my\r\nliberty, seeing that, but for me, you would not be alive to accord\r\nit.\" Thenceforth he was always a reliable ally of the Spaniards against\r\nMoro incursions. In 1882 Cuevas was opposed by an arrogant Sulu chief,\r\nDatto Calun, who challenged him to single combat, and Cuevas having\r\nslain his adversary, the tribe of the vanquished warrior, admiring\r\nthe conqueror's valour, proclaimed him their _Datto_, which title was\r\nacknowledged by Datto Aliudi, the claimant to the Sulu Sultanate. On\r\nJuly 6, 1904, his graceful daughter Urang was married, with Mahometan\r\nrites, to a twenty-one-year-old Spanish half-caste, Ramon Laracoechea,\r\nwho was introduced to me by his father, a very pleasant Vizcayan,\r\nresident in the Island since 1876. Educated in Manila, the son speaks\r\nEnglish, Spanish, Yacano and Joloano. The festivities lasted for\r\nseveral days, some Americans being among the invited guests. Shortly\r\nafter this event the _Datto_, at the age of fifty-nine years, ended\r\nhis adventurous career in this world, regretted by all. In expectation\r\nof the demise of Datto Cuevas, which was anticipated months before,\r\nthere were three aspirants to the coming vacant dattoship in the\r\npersons of the son-in-law, Ramon, Cuevas' nephew, and an American of\r\nhumble origin and scant education who had married a Zamboanguena woman.\r\n\r\nIn Sulu Island social conditions were most deplorable. Under the Bates\r\nAgreement the Moros became turbulent, and even attempted to take Jolo\r\ntown by assault. In August, 1903, General Wood went there, and the\r\n_Dattos_ having been invited to meet him, quite a crowd of them came,\r\naccompanied by about 600 fighting-men in a splendid fleet of armed\r\n_vintas_ (war-canoes). Precautions had to be taken against possible\r\ntreachery, and a company of troops was brought into the town in\r\nreadiness for any event. The object of the meeting was to discuss the\r\nrespective limits of the _Dattos'_ spheres, but owing to the haughty,\r\ninsolent tone of the chiefs, nothing definite was arrived at. When\r\nthey were invited to state their claims, they arrogantly replied,\r\n\"We have no information to give. You say you are going to define\r\nour limits--well, what have you to tell us? We come to listen, not\r\nto talk.\" Some chiefs, however, feigned to offer their submission,\r\nand all was apparently quiet for a time.\r\n\r\nMajor Hugh L. Scott (14th Cavalry) was then appointed (in September) to\r\nthe government of that district. The Sultan being too weak to control\r\nhis subordinates, many of them rallied their men and independently\r\ndefied all interference with their old mode of living and rule. The\r\nSultan, not unnaturally, was averse to ceding his sovereign rights to\r\nany one, and he and his _Dattos_ obstructed, as far as they could, the\r\nAmericans' endeavours to better the conditions of the people. Every\r\nfew days a _juramentado_ (_vide_ pp. 146, 150) would enter the town\r\nand attack a white man with his _barong_ in broad daylight. There\r\nwas nothing furtive in his movements, no hiding under cover to take\r\nhis victim unawares, but a straight, bold frontal attack. _Barong_\r\nin hand, a Moro once chased a soldier though the street, upstairs into\r\na billiard-room, and down the other steps, where he was shot dead by\r\na sentinel. At another time a _juramentado_ obtained access into the\r\ntown by crawling through a drain-pipe, and chased two soldiers until\r\nhe was killed. Many Americans were wounded in the streets of Jolo,\r\nbut the aggressors were always pursued to death. Petty hostilities,\r\nattacks and counter-attacks, the sallies of punitive parties to avenge\r\nsome violence committed, and the necessity for every individual in\r\nthe town, civil or military, being armed and always alert, made life\r\nthere one of continual excitement and emotion.\r\n\r\nIn November, 1903, the attitude of the _Dattos_ became very\r\nmenacing. Datto Andong actually cut a trench just outside the walled\r\ntown of Jolo as a base of operations against the Americans. It was\r\nevident that an important rising of chiefs was contemplated. Major\r\nScott having called upon the biggest chief, Panglima [262] Hassan,\r\nto present himself and account for the murder of an American survey\r\nparty, he came with a large force, estimated at about 4,000, well\r\narmed, as far as the town walls. He said he wanted to enter the\r\ntown with a suite of only 700 armed men, including his subordinate\r\n_Dattos_. Finally Major Scott agreed to his entry with 70 warriors,\r\nbut still the position was threatening with Hassan's army in the\r\nvicinity. During the interview Panglima Hassan appeared quite friendly;\r\nindeed, whilst he and the major were riding together, the chief,\r\nperceiving that his host was unarmed, gallantly remarked, \"As you are\r\nwithout arms I will relinquish mine also,\" and at once took off his\r\n_barong_ and handed it to his attendant. In the meantime Major Scott\r\nhad sent a request to General Wood for more troops, but the general,\r\nwho had only just finished his Taraca operations, replied that he\r\nwould come to Jolo himself. Almost simultaneously with his arrival in\r\nZamboanga the general had the satisfaction to receive a message from\r\nthe Taraca _Datto_ offering his submission, and asking to be judged\r\naccording to the Koran. On General Wood's arrival with troops in Jolo\r\na demand was made on Panglima Hassan to surrender. After protracted\r\nnegotiations and many insolent messages from Hassan, the general\r\nled his troops down to Lake Seite, where an engagement took place,\r\nleaving 60 dead Moros on the field. Panglima Hassan, pursued from\r\nplace to place, lost many warriors at every halt, the total being\r\nestimated at 400 to 500. _Cottas_ were razed to the ground, and the\r\nnotorious Panglima Hassan himself was captured on November 14, with a\r\nloss, so far, of one soldier killed and five wounded on the American\r\nside. Panglima Hassan was being escorted into Jolo town by Major\r\nScott and other officers when suddenly the chief, pointing towards\r\na native-built house, begged the major to save his family. Moved by\r\ncompassion and influenced by Hassan's previous friendly attitude, the\r\nmajor generously consented, and as they all approached the entrance,\r\nin an instant out rushed the \"family\"--a mob of armed Moros, who\r\nattacked the officers whilst the Panglima made his escape. Poor Major\r\nScott was so badly cut about on his hands that he had to go into\r\nhospital for four months, and I noticed that he had had one left-hand\r\nfinger and two right-hand half-fingers amputated. Unable to handle\r\nany kind of weapon, in March, 1904, he led his troops against the\r\ncunning _Datto_, who sent out a large body of fighting-men to meet\r\nhim. After several attacks were repelled, Panglima Hassan took to\r\nflight, his followers all the time decreasing in numbers until, with\r\nonly 80 men, the chief sought refuge in his _cotta_ at Pang-Pang,\r\nthe strongest fortress in the Island. Breaches were made in it, and\r\nHassan fled for his life on a swift pony, with only two retainers,\r\nto the crater of an extinct volcano, which was quickly surrounded\r\nby the Americans. Each time a head appeared above the crater edge a\r\nvolley was fired, but the wounded chief still bravely held out and\r\nhit some soldiers before he died, riddled by bullets, on March 4.\r\n\r\nAgain, in May, 1905, Datto Pala, of Sulu Island, with a large\r\nfollowing, threatened Jolo town, and General Wood personally led\r\nthe expedition against this chief. Eight miles from Maybun the Moros\r\nhad dug pits and placed wires to impede the Americans' advance, but,\r\nnotwithstanding these obstacles, the enemy was vigorously attacked\r\nand surrounded near the Maybun Lake, three miles from the town. After\r\nseveral days' desperate fighting the _cotta_ of Lumbo was captured,\r\nand the _Datto_ and his men were vanquished, the losses being about\r\nseven Americans killed, about 20 wounded, and over 250 Moros killed.\r\n\r\nIn June, 1904, Datto Ambutong had a dispute with another about the\r\npossession of some property, and on Major Scott being appealed to\r\nin the matter, he ordered Ambutong to appear before him in Jolo\r\nfor a _bichara_ (judicial inquiry). The _Datto_, in a sulky mood,\r\nat first refused to come, but on further pressure he changed his\r\nmind. Early in the morning of the appointed day a friendly chief,\r\nDatto Timbang, came into town with four retainers, all armed, to\r\nsee the Governor. Major Scott, whose guest I was, kindly invited me\r\nto the interview, during which it transpired that Datto Timbang had\r\nheard Ambutong declare he would come to the _bichara_, but he would\r\nnot leave it without taking heads. Datto Timbang added that he too\r\ndesired to attend the _bichara_ with his bodyguard, resolved to slay\r\nAmbutong if he observed any threatening move on his part. The major\r\nmade no objection, and at the appointed hour four of us--my gallant\r\nhost, Major Barbour, Captain Charles and myself--went to the _bichara_\r\nat the Governor's office in town. The Governor (i.e., the major) sat\r\nat his desk, and we other three took seats just behind him. Before\r\nus were the Datto Ambutong, his opponent in the question at issue,\r\nand, a yard off him, the friendly Datto Timbang and his followers,\r\neach with his hand on his _barong_, ready to cut down Ambutong at a\r\nstroke if need be. Whilst the case was being heard, Hadji Butu, the\r\nSultan's Prime Minister, and Sultan Tattarassa, of Paragua Island,\r\nthe latter afflicted with _locomotor ataxy_, came in, saluted us all,\r\nand took seats. The business ended, Datto Ambutong rose from his\r\nstool, gave his hand to the major, and then walked to the back of\r\nhim to salute us. I thought I should like to handle the beautiful\r\n_barong_ which was to have served him in taking heads. The _Datto_\r\ncomplaisantly allowed me to draw it from the sheath and pass it round\r\nto my friends. Sharp as a razor, it was the finest weapon of the class\r\nI had ever touched. The handle was of carved ivory and Camagon wood\r\n(_vide_ p. 314), the whole instrument being valued at quite $100. Datto\r\nTimbang was watching, and the occasion was not a propitious one for\r\ntaking christian blood.\r\n\r\nThe following translation of a letter which Major Hugh L. Scott\r\ncourteously gave me will serve to illustrate how lightly human life\r\nis appreciated by the Moro.\r\n\r\n\r\n    This letter from your son, His Highness Datto Mohammed Dahiatul\r\n    Kalbi, to my father, the Governor of Sulu, Major Scott, and to\r\n    my younger brother, Sali.\r\n\r\n    I want to inform you that at 7 o'clock in the morning of Saturday,\r\n    we had a fight with Tallu. I have taken his head, but if you\r\n    will allow it, I will bury it, if my father will let me do that,\r\n    because he is an Islam and I would commit an offence. It scared\r\n    my wife very much when she looked at the head in my house. Those\r\n    that are dead were Sadalani, Namla, Muhamad, and Salui. Beyond\r\n    that I have not investigated.\r\n\r\n    With greetings to my father and to my younger brother, I beg you,\r\n    my younger brother, to let me bury the head, if my father does not\r\n    feel bad about it. If our father should not believe that the head\r\n    is there, come to our house and see yourself, so to be sure. I\r\n    would not soil the faith my father has in me. To close I herewith\r\n    send the kris of Orang Kaya Tallu. The end of the pen. Sunday,\r\n    February 23, 1904.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWhilst I was in Zamboanga in June, 1904, Datto Pedro Cuevas, of\r\nBasilan Island, sent a message over to say that there would be no\r\nmore trouble with certain pirates who had been caught, as he had cut\r\noff their heads.\r\n\r\nIt would fill a volume to recount the legends of the sharks near\r\nCagayan de Jolo which wreck ships; the Moro who heard the voice of\r\nAllah rising from a floating cocoanut to urge him to denounce the\r\nSultan's evil ways; the new prophet who could point at any object\r\nand make it disappear, and a hundred other superstitious extravagances.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nJolo (_vide_ p. 149), one of the prettiest places on earth, has\r\nbeen improved since the American occupation. Apart from the many\r\nnew buildings erected for military convenience, there is now a fine\r\njetty with a tramway, a landing-stage for small vessels, a boys'\r\nand a girls' school, some new residences, etc. The municipality\r\nis under the presidency of a military officer, and the clean,\r\norderly aspect of the town is evidence of Anglo-Saxon energy in\r\nits administration. In 1904 there was only one drinking-saloon,\r\nkept by a Bohemian-born American, who paid $6,000 a year for his\r\nmonopoly licence. Much to the disgust of the military, a society of\r\nwell-intentioned temperance ladies in America procured the prohibition\r\nof alcohol-selling in military canteens and Post Exchanges. The\r\neastern extremity of Jolo is appropriated for military purposes,\r\nand on the rising ground is situated the stabling for the cavalry\r\nhorses. There is a large military hospital, well appointed, and a\r\nclub-house for whites, overlooking the picturesque harbour. Outside\r\nthe town walls towards the west the dwellings of natives, chiefly from\r\nother islands in their origin, extend about a mile as far as Tulay,\r\nwhere the Sultan has a residence. On the way one passes through the\r\nlittle square, in the centre of which stands a monument erected to\r\ncommemorate the landing here of Gov.-General Corcuera, April 17,\r\n1638. During my last visit to Jolo I called upon His Highness the\r\nSultan at Tulay, accompanied by the civil interpreter, Mr. J. Schueck,\r\nwhose late father I had known many years before. [263] Tulay signifies\r\n_bridge_ in Tagalog, and probably this place derives its name from the\r\nbridge spanning the rivulet, which forms a natural division between\r\nthis village and the Jolo ex-mural western suburb. Just across the\r\nbridge, in most unattractive surroundings, stands a roofed rough pile\r\nof wooden planks--the residence of the Sultan. At a few paces to\r\nthe left of it one sees another gloomy structure, smaller and more\r\ncheerless than the royal abode--it is the domicile of Hadji Butu,\r\nthe Sultan's Prime Minister.\r\n\r\nPassing through the ground-floor, which serves as a vestibule and\r\nstorehouse for nondescript rubbish, I was met by several armed Moros\r\nwho conducted me up a dark staircase, the lid of which, at the top,\r\nwas raised to admit me to the royal presence. His Highness, the\r\nMajasari Hadji Mohammad Jamalul Kiram, reclining on a cane-bottomed\r\nsofa, graciously smiled, and extending his hand towards me, motioned\r\nto me to take the chair in front of him, whilst Mr. Schueck sat on\r\nthe sofa beside the Sultan. His Highness is about thirty-six years\r\nof age, short, thick set, wearing a slight moustache and his hair\r\ncropped very close. With a cotton _sarong_ around his loins, the\r\nnakedness of his body down to the waist was only covered by _jabul_\r\n(_vide_ p. 146) thrown loosely over him. Having explained that I\r\nwas desirous of paying my respects to the son of the great Sultan\r\nwhose hospitality I had enjoyed years ago at Maybun, I was offered\r\na cigar and the conversation commenced. Just at that moment came\r\nthe Prime Minister, who spoke a little English, and at the back of\r\nme, facing the Sultan, stood his trusted warriors in semi-circle,\r\nattired in fantastic garments and armed to the teeth. From time to\r\ntime a dependent would come, bend the knee on the royal footstool and\r\npresent the _buyo_ box, or a message, or whatever His Highness called\r\nfor. The footstool attracted my curiosity, and my eye was fixed on\r\nit for a while until I could decipher the lettering, which was upside\r\ndown. At last I made it out--\"Van Houten's Cocoa.\" The audience-chamber\r\nneeds no minute description; it can be all summed up in bare boards,\r\nboxes, bundles, weapons, dirt, a dilapidated writing-desk, a couple\r\nof old chairs, and the Sultan's sofa-seat. Of course the Sultan\r\nhad a grievance. The Americans, he said, had appropriated his\r\npearl-fisheries, his tribute-money, and other sources of valuable\r\nincome; they were diverting the taxes payable to him into their own\r\ncoffers, with detriment to his estate and his dignity as a ruler. [264]\r\nThe questions in dispute and his position generally were, he added,\r\nto be discussed between him and the Insular Government in Manila in the\r\nfollowing month. Naturally, the study of the man and his surroundings\r\ninterested me far more than conversation on a subject which was not\r\nmy business. Speaking with warmth, at every gesture the _jabul_ would\r\nslide down to his waist, exposing his bare breast, so that perhaps\r\nI saw more of the _Majasari_ than is the privilege of most European\r\nvisitors. On leave-taking His Highness graciously presented me with\r\na handsome Moro dress-sword and a betel-cutter set in a solid silver\r\nhandle, and, in return, I sent him my portrait from Manila.\r\n\r\nExactly a month after my visit, the Sultan, accompanied by Major\r\nScott, the Governor and Commander of Jolo, came and made a short stay\r\nin Manila, where he was conducted around town and to the presence of\r\nthe authorities. Many valuable presents were officially made to him,\r\ntogether with P5,000 pocket-money to console him for the postponement\r\n_sine die_ of the \"settlement\" question. Driving round in wagonettes,\r\nhis retinue saw the sights of the capital and made their purchases,\r\nbut the Sultan himself was strictly guarded from pressmen and others\r\nwho might give local publicity to his claims.\r\n\r\nAmerica's policy with regard to the Sultan of Sulu and all other\r\nSultans and _Dattos_, as expounded to me by the best American\r\nauthorities, is as clear as crystal. They wish all these petty\r\npotentates were elsewhere; but as that cannot be, they must be shorn\r\nof all power, princely dignity being out of harmony with American\r\ninstitutions. Nevertheless, they can call themselves what they like\r\namong their own people, provided that in their relations with the\r\nGovernment of the Islands they are to be simple citizens with dominion\r\nover their own personal property, but not over that of others. There\r\nis to be no sovereign power, great or small, other than American,\r\nand tribal wards are to supersede dattoships. The _Dattos_ are more\r\nnumerous than Continental barons, and of varying grades, from the\r\nPanglima Hassan type, possessor of fortresses, commander of 5,000\r\nmen, down to the titular lord of four score acres who lounges in the\r\nvillage, in filthy raiment, closely followed by two juveniles, the\r\none carrying his bright metal _buyo_ box, in case he needs a quid,\r\nand the other the bearer of the _barong_, lest he must assert his\r\ndignity by force. America has decreed that from these and all their\r\ncompeers the Philippines are to be preserved.\r\n\r\nIn November, 1903, the District Governor of Zamboanga summoned\r\nthe Manguiguin, or Sultan of Mindanao (_vide_ p. 131), and all the\r\n_Dattos_ in his district to attend a durbar. The aged Sultan very\r\nreluctantly responded to the call, and, accompanied by his Prime\r\nMinister, Datto Ducalat, and a large retinue, the royal party came\r\nin about 250 armed _vintas_. When they were within a few miles\r\nof the port they sent a message to ask if they would be allowed to\r\nsalute with their _lantacas_, and the reply being in the affirmative,\r\nthey entered the harbour with great _eclat_, amidst the booming of a\r\nhundred cannon. Interpreters put off to meet them and escorted them\r\nto the landing-stage, where the District Governor waited to receive\r\nthem. The Sultan wore a gorgeous turban, a royal _sarong_ worked\r\nin thread of gold, and shoes with similar adornments. On landing,\r\nthe old prince, trembling from top to toe, with despairing glance\r\nclutched the arm of the Governor for protection. Never before had\r\nhe seen the great city of Zamboanga; he was overcome and terrified\r\nby its comparative grandeur, and possibly by the imposing figure of\r\nthe six-foot Governor himself. The police had to be called out to\r\nrestrain the mobs who watched his arrival. On the other hand, as the\r\nSultans, the _Dattos_ and their suites together numbered about 600,\r\nand from other places by land about 400 more had come, all armed,\r\nmany of the townspeople, with traditional dread, shut themselves\r\nup in their houses, believing that such a vast assemblage of Moros\r\nmight, at any moment, commence a general massacre. It is well known\r\nthat the question of public security did engage the attention of the\r\nAmerican authorities, for the gathering was indeed a formidable one,\r\nand at the moment General Wood was in Sulu Island, leading his troops\r\nagainst Panglima Hassan. All the available forces were therefore\r\nheld in readiness to meet any emergency. With faltering footsteps and\r\nshaking like an aspen leaf, the Manguiguin, followed by his _Dattos_,\r\napproached the double lines of soldiers with fixed bayonets stationed\r\non the quay. There was a pause; the Sultan, who in his youthful days\r\nhad known no fear, now realized the folly of walking into the jaws\r\nof death. But the Governor assured him, through the interpreters,\r\nthat he was doing him the greatest honour that could be rendered to\r\nany prince or to the great president of the greatest republic. Only\r\nhalf convinced and full of suspicion, the Sultan walked on in a daze,\r\nas though he were going to his last doom. Having emerged safely from\r\nthis peril, the great durbar was held, and lasted some hours. This was\r\nfollowed by a reception at the Army and Navy Club, where a throne was\r\nerected under a canopy for the Sultan, with seats of honour around\r\nit for the chief _Dattos_. The reception over, the royal party was\r\nconducted to where waggons and teams awaited them to take them to a\r\nsuburb at the foothills of the great sierra. The Governor purposely\r\nhad the biggest American horses and the largest vehicles brought\r\nout to make an impression. The Sultan point blank refused to enter\r\nthe waggon. He had run the gauntlet through rows of pointed steel,\r\nand now new horrors awaited him. Perfectly bewildered at the sight\r\nof such enormous animals, he turned piteously to his Prime Minister\r\nand invited him to lead the way. \"I will follow your Highness,\" the\r\nminister discreetly replied, but the muscular Governor, Captain John\r\nP. Finley, ended the palaver by gently lifting the Sultan into the\r\nvehicle, whilst he himself immediately entered it, and the timorous\r\nPrime Minister and suite summoned up courage to follow. During the\r\ndrive the Governor gave the word to the teamsters to detach the\r\nforecarriages on reaching the foothills and let the teams go. To\r\nthe great amazement of the Moro chiefs, the waggons suddenly became\r\nstationary, whilst the released horses galloped on ahead! The Sultan\r\nand his suite glanced at each other speechless with fright. Surely\r\nnow their last day had come! So this was the trick treacherously\r\nprepared for them to segregate them from their fighting-men! But\r\nthe teams were caught again, and the waggons brought them safely\r\nback to the sight of the port and the _vintas_. Allah had turned the\r\nhearts of the great white men and rescued his chosen people in the\r\nhour of imminent danger. The durbar was continued day by day until\r\nevery point had been discussed. Meanwhile the Sultan and suite daily\r\nreturned to their _vintas_ afloat to eat, drink, and sleep, whilst\r\nin the town of Zamboanga the christian natives quaked, and crowds\r\nof Moros perambulated the streets in rich and picturesque costumes,\r\nvarying in design according to the usage of their tribes. Before the\r\ndeparture of the royal visitor the troops were formed up, military\r\nevolutions were performed with clockwork precision, and volley after\r\nvolley was fired in the air. The Sultan declared he could never receive\r\nthe Governor with such splendour, but he wanted him to promise to\r\nreturn his visit. It was not politic, however, to agree to do so. And\r\nthe Sultan and his people left, passing once more through lines of\r\ntroops with bayonets fixed, this time with a firmer step than when\r\nthey landed, thanking the Great Prophet for their happy deliverance\r\nfrom what had appeared to them a dreamland of dreadful novelty.\r\n\r\nThe Manguiguin of Mindanao was indeed \"a man of sorrows and acquainted\r\nwith grief,\" for in the days of his decrepitude he was jilted by the\r\nwidow of Utto (_vide_ p. 143), the once celebrated Cottabato _Datto_,\r\nthe idol of the Christian-haters.\r\n\r\nEducation is one of the chief concerns of the Moro Province\r\nGovernment. The efforts of the _School Department_, up to June 30,\r\n1904, will be understood from the following official statistics,\r\nviz. [265]:--\r\n\r\nTeachers employed--15 Americans, 50 Christian Filipinos, and nine\r\nMahometan Filipinos.\r\n\r\n41 Schools were established.\r\n\r\n2,114 Children were on the school rolls.\r\n\r\n1,342 Christian children attended on average.\r\n\r\n240 Moro children attended on average.\r\n\r\nP46,898.17 were expended in the School Department, of which P28,355.09\r\nwere disbursed in Zamboanga District.\r\n\r\nBesides the public schools, the Jesuits are permitted to continue\r\ntheir excellent work of civilization and education in their own\r\nschools wherever they have a mission established.\r\n\r\nAccording to Moro custom the fruit of a man's labour belongs to\r\nthe _Datto_ who gives the man a subsistence. The Americans are\r\nteaching the man that the fruit of his labour is his own, and, for\r\nthat purpose, market-places are established at many centres on the\r\ncoast with the hope of inculcating free-labour notions, so that the\r\nseller can get cash for his goods and keep it. I visited three of\r\nthese markets on the south coast of Mindanao, and also the one in\r\ncourse of construction at Zamboanga (ward of Magay), where Governor\r\nJohn P. Finley was putting his heart and soul into his scheme for\r\ncreating an important Moro Exchange. By Legislative Council Act\r\nNo. 55, the sum of P1,850 was appropriated for its construction,\r\nand the Governor had succeeded in persuading the Moros themselves\r\nto contribute P1,300 towards its completion. The Moros are urged to\r\ncome in their produce-laden _vintas_ and occupy the stalls erected\r\nfor them in the large commodious market-shed, which has accommodation\r\nfor carts and cattle if need be. Boats of less than 15 tons gross are\r\nfree of tax, licence, or documents (Phil. Com. Act No. 1354, of June\r\n15, 1905). Whenever any trouble arises up the coast the Governor's\r\nofficial _vinta_ is despatched, manned by Moros, under the command\r\nof the Governor's messenger, Hadji Nuno, a parvenu _Datto_ whose name\r\nreveals his Spanish origin.\r\n\r\nEverything within the powers of the Legislative Council of the\r\nMoro Province seems to have been done to introduce law, order, and\r\nadministrative uniformity, constrain violence, propagate knowledge\r\nand set the inhabitants on the path of morality and prosperity. The\r\nresult of a century's labour, at the present rate of development,\r\nmight, however, be achieved in a decade if the Insular Government had\r\nauthority from Washington to relax the rigidity of the \"Philippines for\r\nthe Filipinos\" doctrine in the special case of the Moro Province. It\r\nis true the Moros are as much Filipinos as the rest of the Philippine\r\ninhabitants, but it will be generations before they can know how to\r\nenjoy their birthright without the example of energetic white men who\r\nare, naturally, unwilling to come and philanthropically devote their\r\nlives to \"pulling the chestnuts out of the fire\" for the Moro. They\r\nwant to reap some material advantage for themselves. Gen. Leonard Wood,\r\nin his First Annual Report of the Moro Province, remarks:--\"What is\r\nneeded to develop this portion of the world is a suitable class of\r\nsettlers, bringing with them knowledge of modern agricultural methods,\r\nenterprise and some capital.... If he (the Moro) could see the results\r\n... it is believed that his ambition would be stimulated and that his\r\ndevelopment would be comparatively rapid. In short, a scattering of\r\ngood agriculturists throughout the province would be of inestimable\r\nvalue to the people. At the present time such a class of settlers\r\nis _not_ coming, and it is not believed they will come until much\r\nmore liberal inducements are offered them, especially in the way of\r\nobtaining land by settlement. Our standing among the people of these\r\nIslands has been much injured by the presence of a large and tough\r\nclass of so-called Americans whose energies have been principally\r\nextended in the construction, maintenance and patronage of rum shops,\r\nwhich outnumber other American business establishments.\"\r\n\r\nThe American who would go to Mindanao to settle on 40 acres of land\r\ncould not be of the class desired. [266] A maximum of 1,000 acres to\r\nan individual settler and 10,000 acres to a company of not less than\r\nfive persons, would produce a rapid and beneficial development of\r\nMindanao and push on its civilization by giant strides. There would\r\nbe little fear of the natives' rights being unduly encroached upon by\r\nwhites if, in addition to the Homestead Law conditions, the period\r\nof application for land were limited to two or three years from the\r\npromulgation of the law, with solid guarantees to prevent a flood of\r\nbogus applications from land-grabbers. The Treasurer, in his First\r\nAnnual Report of the Moro Province, says:--\"It is not reasonable to\r\nexpect, under present conditions, any systematic effort on their\r\n(the Moros') part to cultivate the soil, as they know, as well as\r\nthe powers that be, that they have no assurance that the land they\r\nwill improve to-day will be theirs to-morrow. They have title to not\r\none foot of land, and no guarantee from the Government that present\r\nimprovements will be theirs when they are finally settled by the\r\nformer. A liberal _land law_ will also bring an influx of settlers\r\nand capital.... It will not only make this province the richest part\r\nof the Philippine Islands and the State the beneficiary, but it will\r\nremove the necessity for the soldier in the field. No other legislation\r\nis going to improve financial conditions here to any extent. There is\r\nno doubt the Government land unsettled and untouched in this province\r\namounts to 90 per cent. of all the tillable land, and equals in area\r\nand excels in richness that of all the tillable land of Luzon.\"\r\n\r\nThe District of Davao is far more developed agriculturally than the\r\nother four. Planters whom I know personally are opening up land and\r\nproducing large quantities of hemp, giving employment to Bagobos\r\nand others, but without any certainty about the possession of the\r\nland. Inexhaustible forests of fine timber remain undisturbed,\r\nand are left to decay in the ordinary course of nature, whilst\r\nshiploads of Oregon pine arrive for public works. My attendance at\r\nthe public conferences on the timber-felling question, before the\r\nPhilippine Commission in Manila, did not help me to appreciate the\r\npolicy underlying the Insular Government's apparent reluctance to\r\nstimulate the development of the timber industry; indeed, it is not\r\neasy to follow the working of the \"Philippines for the Filipinos\"\r\npolicy in several details.\r\n\r\nIn 1904 General Wood recommended to the Philippine Commission the\r\nincorporation of the present provinces of Misamis and Surigao in\r\nthe Moro Province, seeing that the people of those provinces and\r\nthe Moro Province belong to the same races and have identical\r\ninterests. As it is, the hill tribes of Misamis find themselves\r\nbetween two jurisdictions, and have to pass nearly a hundred miles\r\nthrough the Moro Province to reach the sea coast--an anomaly which\r\nwill no doubt be rectified by including the whole Island of Mindanao\r\nin the Moro Province.\r\n\r\nThe American Government's abstinence from proselytism in dealing\r\nwith the Moros is more likely to succeed than Spain's well-meant\r\n\"policy of attraction\" adopted in the last years of her rule, for\r\nwhatever progress this system made was counterbalanced by the futile\r\nendeavour to induce the Mahometans to change their religion. Under\r\nthe wise administration set in progress by General Leonard Wood there\r\nis a hopeful future for Moroland.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXX\r\n\r\nThe Spanish Friars, After 1898\r\n\r\nThe Aglipayan Schism. Education. Politics. Population.\r\n\r\n\r\nWith the American dominion came free cult. No public money is\r\ndisbursed for the support of any religious creed. No restraint is\r\nplaced upon the practice of any religion exercised with due regard\r\nto morality. Proselytism in public schools is declared illegal. [267]\r\nThe prolonged discussion of the friars' position and claims encouraged\r\nthem to hope that out of the labyrinthine negotiations might emerge\r\ntheir restoration to the Philippine parishes. For a while, therefore,\r\nhundreds of them remained in Manila, others anxiously watched the\r\ncourse of events from their refuges in the neighbouring British and\r\nPortuguese colonies, and the unpopular Archbishop Bernardino Nozaleda\r\nonly formally resigned the archbishopric of Manila years after he\r\nhad left it. Having prudently retired from the Colony during the\r\nRebellion, he returned to it on the American occupation, and resumed\r\nhis archiepiscopal functions until the end of 1899. Preliminary\r\nnegotiations in Church matters were facilitated by the fact of the\r\nMilitary Governor of the Islands at the time being a Roman Catholic,\r\nan American army chaplain acting as chief intermediary between the lay\r\nand ecclesiastical authorities. The common people were quite unable, at\r\nthe outset, to comprehend that under American law a friar could be in\r\ntheir midst without a shred of civil power or jurisdiction. There were\r\nFilipinos of all classes, some in sympathy with the American cause,\r\nwho were as loud in their denunciation of the proposed return of the\r\nfriars as the most intransigent insurgents. They thought of them most\r\nin their lay capacity of _de facto_ Government agents all over the\r\nIslands. It cannot be said that the parish priests originally sought\r\nto discharge civil functions; they did so, at first, only by order\r\nof their superiors, who were the _de facto_ rulers in the capital,\r\nand afterwards by direct initiative of the lay authorities, because\r\nthe Spanish Government was too poor to employ civil officials. What\r\ntheir functions were is explained in Chapter xii. The complaints of the\r\npeople against the friars constituted the leading theme of Dr. Rizal's\r\nwritings, notably his \"Noli me tangere,\" and the expulsion of the four\r\nobnoxious Religious Orders is claimed to have been one of the most\r\nimportant reforms verbally promised in connexion with the alleged\r\nTreaty of Biac-na-bato. The allegation of the prelates and other\r\nmembers of the regular clergy who gave evidence before the American\r\nCivil Commission in 1900, to the effect that the _Katipunan Society_\r\nmembers invaded the parishes only to murder the friars and rob the\r\nchurches, should be weighed against the fact that two hundred thousand\r\nFilipinos were ready to leave glowing life for grim death to rid\r\nthe country of monastic rule. The townspeople, apparently apathetic,\r\nwere afraid to express their opinion of the friars until they were\r\nbacked up by the physical force of the _Katipunan_ legions. It was\r\nthe conflict of material interests and the friars' censorship which\r\ncreated the breach between the vicar and the people. The immorality\r\nof the friars was not general and by no means the chief ground,\r\nif any, for hostility against them; the frailties of the few simply\r\nweakened the prestige of all and broke the pedestal of their moral\r\nsuperiority. My own investigations convinced me that the friars'\r\nincontinence was generally regarded with indifference by the people;\r\nconcubinage being so common among the Filipinos themselves it did\r\nnot shock them in the pastor's case. Moreover, women were proud of\r\nthe paternity of their children begotten in their relationship to\r\nthe friars.\r\n\r\nWhen, on the American occupation, the friar question could be freely\r\ndiscussed, hot disputes at once ensued between the friar party and\r\nthe Philippine clergy, supported by the people. In the meantime, an\r\nApostolic Delegate, Monsignor P. L. Chapelle, [268] was appointed by\r\nthe Pope, in agreement with the American Government, to endeavour to\r\nadjust the friar problem. The details to be considered were manifold,\r\nbut the questions which most interested the public were the return\r\nof the friars to the parishes and the settlement of their property\r\nclaims. Monsignor Chapelle so vigorously espoused the cause of the\r\nfriars that he appeared to be more their advocate than an independent\r\njudge in the controversy. Many friars, anxious to quit the Islands,\r\nwere dissuaded from doing so by this prelate. [269] He arrived in\r\nManila on January 2, 1900, and, without having made any personal\r\ninvestigations in the provinces, by the 16th of April he deemed\r\nhimself competent to declare that \"the accusations adduced against\r\nthem (the Religious Orders) are the merest pretexts of shrewd and\r\nanti-American Filipino politicians.\" [270] As a matter of fact,\r\nnothing anti-American, or American, had any connexion with the\r\nsubject. The struggle to expel the friars from these Islands was\r\ninitiated years before the Americans contemplated intervention in\r\nPhilippine affairs. Open rebellion was started against the friars\r\ntwenty months before the Battle of Cavite. Nozaleda and Chapelle\r\nwished to appoint friars to the provincial benefices, whilst protests\r\nagainst this proposal were coming from nearly every Christian quarter\r\nof the Colony. The Filipinos desired to have the whole administration\r\nof the Church in their own hands and, if possible, to see every\r\nfriar leave the Archipelago. The representative Philippine clergy\r\nwere Dr. Mariano Sevilla, Father Rojas, Father Changco, and Father\r\nSingson. The great champions of the national cause were the first two,\r\nwho stoutly opposed Nozaleda's schemes. Fierce discussions arose\r\nbetween the parties; Father Sevilla and party defied Nozaleda to\r\nmake the appointments he desired, and then sent a cablegram to the\r\nPope to the following effect:--\"Archbishop and Apostolic Delegate\r\nwant to appoint friars to the Philippine benefices. The Philippine\r\npeople strongly oppose. Schism imminent.\" Father Sevilla could\r\nnot be wheedled into agreeing to Nozaleda's and Chapelle's plans,\r\nso he was sent to prison for two months in the _Calle de Anda_,\r\nManila, and deportation to the Island of Guam was menacingly hinted\r\nat. When the reply came from Rome, disapproving of the action of the\r\ntwo prelates, Father Sevilla was released from prison. Nevertheless,\r\nNozaleda's wrath was unappeased. He then proposed that the benefices\r\nshould be shared between Filipinos and friars, whilst Father Sevilla\r\ninsisted on the absolute deposition of the friars. At this time there\r\nwere 472 members of the four confraternities in the Islands, mostly\r\nin Manila. [271] At a meeting of the Philippine clergy the expulsion\r\nof the friars was proposed and supported by a majority; but Father\r\nSevilla vetoed the resolution, and his ruling was obeyed. Moreover,\r\nhe agreed that the friars should hold some benefices in and near Manila\r\nand the ecclesiastical-educational employments in the colleges. \"We,\"\r\nsaid Father Sevilla, \"are for the Church; let them continue their work\r\nof education; it is not our function.\" Nozaleda then made advances\r\ntowards Father Sevilla, and endeavoured to cajole him by the offer of\r\nan appointment, which he repeatedly refused. Rome, for the time being,\r\nhad overruled the question of the benefices contrary to Nozaleda's\r\nwish. For the moment there was nothing further for the Philippine\r\nclergy to defend, but in their general interests Father Sevilla,\r\ntheir spokesman, elected to remain in an independent position until\r\nafter the retirement of Monsignor Chapelle, when Father Sevilla became\r\nparish priest of Hagonoy (Bulacan).\r\n\r\nThe outcome of the controversy respecting the benefices was that the\r\nfriars could be sent to those parishes where the people were willing to\r\nreceive them, without danger of giving rise to public disorder. This\r\nwas in accordance with President McKinley's Instructions to the Taft\r\nCommission dated April 7, 1900, [272] which says: \"No form of religion\r\nand no minister of religion shall be forced upon any community or\r\nupon any citizen of the Islands.\"\r\n\r\nArchbishop Nozaleda left for Spain, but did not relinquish his\r\narchbishopric until June, 1903. [273] In his absence his office was\r\nadministered by Father Martin Garcia Alcocer, the Spanish bishop\r\nof Cebu, whilst the bishopric of Cebu was left in charge of a\r\npopular Chinese half-caste secular priest, Father Singson, [274] who\r\nsubsequently became vicar of Cebu on the appointment of an American\r\nprelate, Father Hendrichs, to the bishopric.\r\n\r\nIn the matter of the _Friars' lands_, it was apparently impossible\r\nto arrive at any settlement with the friars themselves. The purchase\r\nof their estates was recommended by the Insular Government, and the\r\nCongress at Washington favourably entertained that proposal. In many\r\nplaces the tenants refused to pay rent to the friars, who then put\r\nforward the extraordinary suggestion that the Government should send\r\nan armed force to coerce the tenants. The Government at once refused\r\nto do this, pointing out that the ordinary courts were open to them\r\nthe same as to all citizens. Truly the friars found themselves in a\r\ndilemma. By the rules of their Order they could not sue in a court of\r\nlaw; but under the Spanish Government, which was always subservient\r\nto their will, they had been able to obtain redress by force. Under\r\nthe American Government these immunities and privileges ceased.\r\n\r\nIn 1902 the Civil Governor of the Philippines, Mr. W. H. Taft, visited\r\nthe United States, and on May 9 in that year he was commissioned\r\nby his Government to visit Rome on his way back to the Islands in\r\norder to negotiate the question of the friars' lands with the Holy\r\nSee. The instructions issued to him by the Secretary of War contain\r\nthe following paragraphs, namely [275]:--\r\n\r\nOne of the controlling principles of our Government is the complete\r\nseparation of Church and State, with the entire freedom of each\r\nfrom any control or interference by the other. This principle is\r\nimperative wherever American jurisdiction extends, and no modification\r\nor shading thereof can be a subject of discussion. . . . By reason of\r\nthe separation, the Religious Orders can no longer perform, in behalf\r\nof the State, the duties in relation to public instruction and public\r\ncharities formerly resting upon them. . . . They find themselves the\r\nobject of such hostility on the part of their tenantry against them\r\nas landlords, and on the part of the people of the parishes against\r\nthem as representatives of the former Government, that they are no\r\nlonger capable of serving any useful purpose for the Church. No rents\r\ncan be collected from the populous communities occupying their lands,\r\nunless it be by the intervention of the civil government with armed\r\nforce. Speaking generally, for several years past the friars, formerly\r\ninstalled over the parishes, have been unable to remain at their posts,\r\nand are collected in Manila with the vain hope of returning. They\r\nwill not be voluntarily accepted again by the people, and cannot be\r\nrestored to their positions except by forcible intervention on the\r\npart of the civil government, which the principles of our Government\r\nforbid....It is for the interest of the Church, as well as for the\r\nState, that the landed proprietorship of the Religious Orders in the\r\nPhilippine Islands should cease, and that if the Church wishes...to\r\ncontinue its ministration among the people of the Islands...it should\r\nseek other agents therefor. It is the wish of our Government, in\r\ncase Congress shall grant authority, that the titles of the Religious\r\nOrders to the large tracts of agricultural lands which they now hold\r\nshall be extinguished, but that full and fair compensation shall be\r\nmade therefor. It is not, however, deemed to be for the interests\r\nof the people of the Philippine Islands that...a fund should thereby\r\nbe created to be used for the attempted restoration of the friars to\r\nthe parishes from which they are now separated, with the consequent\r\ndisturbance of law and order. Your errand will not be, in any sense\r\nor degree, diplomatic in its nature; but will be purely a business\r\nmatter of negotiation by you, as Governor of the Philippines, for the\r\npurchase of property from the owners thereof, and the settlement of\r\nland titles.\"\r\n\r\nGovernor Taft arrived in Rome in June, 1902, in the pontificate\r\nof His Holiness Leo XIII., whose Secretary of State was Cardinal\r\nM. Rampolla. In Governor Taft's address to His Holiness, the following\r\ninteresting passage occurs: \"On behalf of the Philippine Government, it\r\nis proposed to buy the lands of the Religious Orders with the hope that\r\nthe funds thus furnished may lead to their withdrawal from the Islands,\r\nand, if necessary, a substitution therefor, as parish priests, of\r\nother priests whose presence would not be dangerous to public order.\"\r\n\r\nIn the document dated June 22, in reply to Governor Taft's address\r\nto His Holiness, Cardinal Rampolla says: \"As to the Spanish religious\r\nin particular belonging to the Orders mentioned in the instructions,\r\nnot even they should be denied to return to those parishes where the\r\npeople are disposed to receive them without disturbance of public\r\norder . . . The Holy See will not neglect to promote, at the same\r\ntime, the better ecclesiastical education and training of the native\r\nclergy, in order to put them in the way, according to their fitness,\r\nof _taking gradually_ the place of the Religious Orders in the\r\ndischarge of the pastoral functions. The Holy See likewise recognizes\r\nthat in order to reconcile more fully the feelings of the Filipinos\r\nto the religious possessing landed estates, _the sale of the same is\r\nconducive thereto_. The Holy See declares it is disposed to furnish the\r\nnew Apostolic Delegate, who is to be sent to the Philippine Islands,\r\nwith necessary and opportune instructions in order to treat amicably\r\nthis affair in understanding with the American Government and the\r\nparties interested.\"\r\n\r\nIn the same document the Holy See asked for indemnity for \"the acts of\r\nvandalism perpetrated by the insurgents in the destruction of churches\r\nand the appropriation of sacred vestments,\" and also for the damage\r\ncaused by the occupation by the American Government of \"episcopal\r\npalaces, seminaries, convents, rectories, and other buildings intended\r\nfor worship.\" The Holy See further claimed \"the right and the liberty\r\nof administering the pious trusts of ecclesiastical origin, or of\r\nCatholic foundation, which do not owe their existence to the civil\r\npower exclusively\"; also \"suitable provisions for religious teaching\r\nin the public schools, especially the primary.\"\r\n\r\nGovernor Taft, in his reply to the Holy See, dated July 3, expressed\r\nregret at the suggested appointment of a new Apostolic Delegate,\r\nand sought to bring the Holy See to a definite contract. For the\r\nsettlement of the friars' land question he proposed \"a tribunal\r\nof arbitration to be composed of five members--two to be appointed\r\nby His Holiness, two to be appointed by the Philippine Government,\r\nand one, the fifth, to be selected by an indifferent person, like\r\nthe Governor-General of India\"; the expenses to be defrayed wholly\r\nby the Philippine Government, and the tribunal to meet in the City\r\nof Manila not later than January 1, 1903. He further proposed that\r\nthe lands should be valued in Mexican dollars, and be paid for in\r\nthree cash instalments of three, six, and nine months after the\r\nreport of the award and the delivery of the deeds. Furthermore, that\r\n\"the payments ought to be made to the person designated by the Holy\r\nSee to receive the same,\" on the condition that \"no money shall be\r\npaid for the lands to be purchased until proper conveyances for the\r\nland shall have been made to the Philippine Government.\" Another\r\ncondition was \"that all the members of the four Religious Orders\r\nof Dominicans, Agustinians, Recoletos, and Franciscans now in the\r\nIslands shall withdraw therefrom after two years from the date of\r\nthe first payment. An exception is made in favour of any member of\r\nthose Orders who has been able to avoid hostility of the people and\r\nto carry on his duties as parish priest, in his parish outside Manila,\r\nfrom August, 1898, to date of this agreement,\" because \"it is certain\r\nthat such a priest is popular with the people.\" Governor Taft adds:\r\n\"Nothing will calm the fears of the people.... except the definite\r\nknowledge ... that the Spanish friars of the four Orders are to leave\r\nthe Islands at a definite time, and are not to return to the parishes.\"\r\n\r\nCardinal Rampolla replied on July 9 to Governor Taft's communication\r\nof July 3, which covered his proposed contract and enclosed a counter\r\nproject of convention, explaining as follows:--\"The Holy See cannot\r\naccept the proposition of the Philippine Government to recall from the\r\nArchipelago in a fixed time all the religious of Spanish nationality\r\n... and to prevent their return in the future. In effect, such a\r\nmeasure ... would be contrary to the positive rights guaranteed by\r\nthe Treaty of Paris, and would put, consequently, the Holy See in\r\nconflict with Spain ... Such a measure would be, in the eyes of the\r\nFilipinos and of the entire Catholic world, the explicit confirmation\r\nof all the accusations brought against the said religious by their\r\nenemies, accusations of which ... the evident exaggeration cannot\r\nbe disputed. If the American Government, respecting, as it does,\r\nindividual rights, does not dare to interdict the Philippine soil\r\nto the Spanish religious ... how could the Pope do it? The Holy See,\r\nin accord with the diocesan authorities, will not permit the return\r\nof the Spanish religious ... in the parishes where their presence\r\nwould provoke troubles.\"\r\n\r\nThe Holy See's counter-proposal was cabled to the Secretary of War,\r\nwho, in his reply dated July 14, which was tantamount to a rejection of\r\nit, remarked: \"The lay Catholic population and the parish priests of\r\nnative and non-Spanish blood are practically a unit in desiring both\r\nto expel the friars and to confiscate their lands ... This proposed\r\nconfiscation, without compensation for the Church lands, was one of the\r\nfundamental policies of the Insurgent Government under Aguinaldo.\" As\r\nan alternative, the Secretary of War accepted the proposal of the Holy\r\nSee to send a new Apostolic Delegate, with necessary instructions to\r\nnegotiate the affair amicably. Therefore, in transmitting this reply\r\nto Cardinal Rampolla on July 15, Gov. Taft closed the negotiations\r\nby stating: \"I have the honour to request ... that the negotiations\r\nconcerning the various subjects touched upon in the proposals and\r\ncounter-proposals be continued in Manila between the Apostolic Delegate\r\nand myself, on the broad lines indicated in this correspondence.... I\r\nmuch regret that we cannot now reach a more precise agreement....\"\r\n\r\nThe receipt of this last communication was courteously acknowledged\r\nby Cardinal M. Rampolla on July 18, 1902, and Gov. Taft then continued\r\nhis journey to the Philippines. [276]\r\n\r\nMonsignor Chapelle's mission had entirely failed to achieve its\r\npurpose, and he retired from the Islands on the appointment of the\r\nnew Apostolic Delegate, Monsignor Giovanni Battista Guidi. Bora\r\non April 27, 1852, this prelate was a man of great culture and a\r\ndistinguished linguist, who had travelled considerably. From Rome he\r\nproceeded to Washington, and, with the United States _exequatur_,\r\nhe entered Manila on November 18, 1902, and died there on June 26,\r\n1904. During his mission the conditions of the friars' land settlement\r\nwere embodied in a contract dated December 28, 1903, whereby the\r\nUnited States undertook to pay, within six months from date, the sum\r\nof $7,227,000 gold in exchange for the title-deeds and conveyances of\r\nall the rural lands belonging to the three corporations possessing\r\nsuch--namely, the Dominicans, Agustinians, and Recoletos. [277]\r\nTo cover this purchase, bonds were issued in America for $7,000,000\r\nbearing 4 per cent, interest per annum; but, as the bonds obtained\r\na premium on the money market, the total amount realized on the\r\nissue was $7,530,370. It remained, therefore, with the corporations\r\nthemselves to deliver the title-deeds, but on personal inquiry of\r\nthe Gov.-General in the month of July following I learnt that up to\r\nthat date they had only partially fulfilled this condition. This,\r\nhowever, concerns them more than it does the American Government,\r\nwhich is ready to pay for value received. The approximate extent of\r\nthe friars' lands is as follows [278]:--\r\n\r\n\r\n    Province.                 Acres.\r\n\r\n    Cavite.                 121,747   Some held for centuries. None\r\n                                      less than one generation.\r\n    La Laguna                62,172\r\n    Rizal                    50,145\r\n    Bulacan                  39,441\r\n    Rizal (Morong)            4,940\r\n    Bataan                    1,000\r\n    Cebu                     16,413\r\n    Cagayan                  49,400   Gov't. grant to Austin friars,\r\n                                      Sept. 25, 1880.\r\n    Mindoro                  58,455   Gov't. grant to Recoleto friars\r\n                                      in 1894.\r\n                            -------\r\n    Total                   403,713\r\n\r\n\r\nThe purchase negotiations became all the more complicated because,\r\nfrom 1893 onwards, the Religious Orders had sold some of their lands\r\nto speculators who undertook to form companies to work them; however,\r\nthe friars were the largest stockholders in these concerns.\r\n\r\nAs the lands become State property they will be offered to the tenants\r\nat the time being at cost price, payable in long terms with moderate\r\ninterest. The annual compounded sum will be only a trifle more than\r\nthe rent hitherto paid. [279]\r\n\r\nAs Governor Taft stated before the United States Senate, it would be\r\nimpolitic to allow the tenants to possess the lands without payment,\r\nbecause such a plan would be promotive of socialistic ideas. The\r\nfriars' land referred to does not include their urban property in and\r\naround Manila, which, with the buildings thereon, they are allowed\r\nto retain for the maintenance of those members of their Orders who\r\nstill hope to remain in the Islands. In July, 1904, there were about\r\n350 friars in the Islands, including the Recoletos in Cavite and the\r\nfew who were amicably received by the people in provincial parishes,\r\nexclusively in their sacerdotal capacity. At this period, at least,\r\nthe Filipinos were not unanimous in rejecting friars as parish\r\npriests. Bishop Hendrichs, of Cebu, told me that he had received a\r\ndeputation of natives from Bojol Island, begging him to appoint friars\r\nto their parishes. In May, 1903, the _Centro Catolico_, a body of lay\r\nFilipinos, well enough educated to understand the new position of the\r\nclergy, addressed a memorial to the Papal delegate, Monsignor Guidi,\r\nexpressing their earnest desire for the retention of the friars. In\r\nthe localities where their presence is desired their influence over\r\nthe people is great. Their return to such parishes is well worth\r\nconsidering. Their ability to restrain the natives extravagances is\r\nsuperior to that of any lay authority, and it is obvious that, under\r\nthe new conditions of government, they could never again produce a\r\nconflict like that of the past.\r\n\r\nThe administrator of the archbishopric of Manila, Father Martin Garcia\r\nAlcocer, retired to Spain (October 25, 1903) on the appointment of\r\nthe present American Archbishop, Monsignor Jeremiah J. Harty, who\r\narrived in the capital in January, 1904. He is a man of pleasing\r\ncountenance, commanding presence, and an impressive orator. Since\r\n1898 churches and chapels of many denominations and creeds have been\r\nopened in the Islands. Natives join them from various motives, for it\r\nwould be venturesome to assert that they are all moved by religious\r\nconviction. In Zamboanga I had the pleasure of meeting an enthusiastic\r\npropagandist, who assured me with pride that he had drawn quite a\r\nnumber of christian natives from their old belief. His sincerity of\r\npurpose enlisted my admiration, but his explanation of the advantages\r\naccruing to his neophytes was too recondite for my understanding.\r\n\r\nThe limpid purity of purpose in the lofty ideal of uplifting all\r\nhumanity, so characteristic of the Roman Catholic Church in Europe,\r\nwas unfortunately obscured in the latter days of Spanish dominion in\r\nthese Islands by the multifarious devices to convert the Church into a\r\nmoney-making channel. If the true religious spirit ever pervaded the\r\nprovincial Filipino's mind, it was quickly impaired in his struggle\r\nto resist the pastor's greed, unless he yielded to it and developed\r\ninto a fanatic or a monomaniac. [280]\r\n\r\nAstute Filipinos, of quicker discernment than their fellows, did not\r\nfail to perceive the material advantages to be reaped from a religious\r\nsystem, quite apart from the religion itself, in the power of union\r\nand its pecuniary potentiality. As a result thereof there came into\r\nexistence, at the close of Spanish rule, the _Philippine Independent\r\nChurch_, more popularly known as the _Aglipayan Church_. Some eight or\r\nnine years before the Philippine Rebellion a young Filipino went to\r\nSpain, where he imbibed the socialistic, almost anarchical, views of\r\nsuch political extremists as Lerroux and Blasco-Ybanez. By nature of\r\na revolutionary spirit, the doctrines of these politicians fascinated\r\nhim so far as to convert him into an intransigent opponent of Spanish\r\nrule in his native country. In 1891 he went to London, where the\r\ncircumstance of the visit of the two priests alluded to at p. 383\r\nwas related to him. He saw in their suggestion a powerful factor for\r\nundermining the supremacy of the friars. The young Filipino pondered\r\nseriously over it, and when the events of 1898 created the opportunity,\r\nhe returned to the Islands impressed with the belief that independence\r\ncould only be gained by union, and that a pseudo-religious organization\r\nwas a good medium for that union.\r\n\r\nThe antecedents and the subsequent career of the initiator of the\r\nPhilippine Independent Church would not lead one to suppose that there\r\nwas more religion in him than there was in the scheme itself. The\r\nprinciple involved was purely that of independence; the incidence of\r\nits development being in this case pseudo-religious, with the view\r\nof substituting the Filipino for the alien in his possession of sway\r\nover the Filipinos' minds, for a purpose. The initiator of the scheme,\r\nnot being himself a gownsman, was naturally constrained to delegate\r\nits execution to a priest, whilst he organized another union, under\r\na different title, which finally brought incarceration to himself\r\nand disaster to his successor.\r\n\r\nGregorio Aglipay, the head of the Philippine Independent, or Aglipayan,\r\nChurch, was born at Batac, in the province of Ilocos Norte, on May\r\n7, 1860, of poor parents, who owned a patch of tobacco land on which\r\nyoung Gregorio worked. Together with his father, he was led to prison\r\nat the age of sixteen for not having planted the obligatory minimum\r\nof 4,000 plants (_vide_ p. 294). On his release he left field-work\r\nand went to Manila, where he took his first lessons at the house\r\nof a Philippine lawyer, Julian Carpio. Two years afterwards, whilst\r\nworking in a menial capacity, he attended the school of San Juan de\r\nLetran. Through a poor relation he was recommended to the notice of\r\nthe Dominican friars, under whose patronage he entered Saint Thomas's\r\nUniversity, where he graduated in philosophy and arts. Then he returned\r\nto his province, entered the seminary, and became a sub-deacon of the\r\ndiocese of Nueva Segovia. In 1889 he was ordained a priest in Manila,\r\nCanon Sanchez Luna being his sponsor, and he said his first mass in the\r\nchurch of Santa Cruz. Although the friars had frequently admonished\r\nhim for his liberal tendencies, he was appointed coadjutor curate\r\nof several provincial parishes, and was acting in that capacity at\r\nVictoria (Tarlac) when the rebellion of 1896 broke out. About that\r\ntime he received a warning from a native priest in another parish\r\nthat the Spaniards would certainly arrest him on suspicion of being\r\nin sympathy with the rebels. In fear of his life he escaped to Manila,\r\nwhere he found a staunch friend in Canon Sanchez Luna, who allowed him\r\nto stay at his house on the pretext of illness. Canon Luna, who was a\r\nSpaniard, obtained from Gov.-General Blanco papers in favour of Aglipay\r\nto ensure his safety back to Victoria. Aglipay then left the capital,\r\nmaking use of the safe-conduct pass to go straight to the rebel camp,\r\nwhere, with the title of chaplain to General Tinio's forces, he was\r\npresent at several engagements and enjoyed the friendship of General\r\nEmilio Aguinaldo. The Malolos Government appointed him Vicar-General,\r\nand after the War of Independence broke out he assumed command of\r\na large body of insurgents in the mountain region of his native\r\nprovince. In 1899 he proclaimed himself chief of the Philippine\r\nIndependent Church, whereupon the Archbishop publicly excommunicated\r\nhim. Later on he voluntarily presented himself to the military\r\nauthorities, and obtained pardon under the amnesty proclamation.\r\n\r\nDr. Mariano Sevilla and several other most enlightened Philippine\r\npriests were in friendly relation with Aglipay for some time, but\r\neventually various circumstances contributed to alienate them from\r\nhis cause. In his overtures towards those whose co-operation he sought\r\nthere was a notable want of frankness and a disposition to treat them\r\nwith that diplomatic reserve compatible only with negotiations between\r\ntwo adverse parties. His association with the lay initiator of the\r\nscheme, unrevealed at the outset, incidentally came to their knowledge\r\nwith surprise and disapproval. Judging, too, from the well-known\r\ntenets of the initiator's associates, there was a suspicion lest the\r\nproposed Philippine Independent Church were really only a detail in\r\na more comprehensive plan involving absolute separation from foreign\r\ncontrol in any shape. Again, he hesitated openly to declare his views\r\nwith respect to the relations with Rome. Conscience here seemed\r\nto play a lesser part than expediency. The millions in the world\r\nwho conscientiously disclaim the supremacy of the Pope, at least\r\nopenly avow it. In the present case the question of submission to,\r\nor rebellion against, the Apostolic successor was quite subordinate\r\nto the material success of the plans for independence. It is difficult\r\nto see in all this the evidence of religious conviction.\r\n\r\nDr. Sevilla had been requested to proceed to Rome to submit to the\r\nHoly Father the aspirations of the Philippine people with respect to\r\nChurch matters, and he consented to do so, provided the movement did\r\nnot in any way affect their absolute submission to the Holy See, and\r\nthat the Philippine Church should remain a Catholic Apostolic Church,\r\nwith the sole difference that its administration should be confided\r\nto the Filipinos instead of to foreigners, if that reform met with\r\nthe approval of his Holiness. [281]\r\n\r\nOnly at this stage did Aglipay admit that he sought independence\r\nof Rome; thereupon the Philippine clergy of distinction abandoned\r\nall thought of participation in the new movement, or of any action\r\nwhich implied dictation to the Holy See. Nevertheless, two native\r\npriests were commissioned to go to Rome to seek the Pope's sanction\r\nfor the establishment of an exclusively Philippine hierarchy under\r\nthe supreme authority of the Pope. But His Holiness immediately\r\ndismissed the delegates with a _non possumus_. The petition to His\r\nHoliness was apparently only the prelude to the ultimate design to\r\nrepudiate the white man's control in matters ecclesiastical, and\r\npossibly more beyond.\r\n\r\nGregorio Aglipay then openly threw off allegiance to the Pope, went to\r\nManila, and in the suburb of Tondo proclaimed himself _Obispo Maximo_\r\n(_Pontifex Maximus_) of his new Church.\r\n\r\nHis sect at once found many followers in the provinces of Rizal,\r\nBulacan and Ilocos, and eventually spread more or less over the other\r\nchristian provinces. The movement is strongest in Ilocos, where several\r\nparishes, indeed, have no other priest than an Aglipayan. This district\r\nis part of the bishopric of Nueva Segovia, now administered by the\r\nAmerican Bishop Dougherty. As to the number of Aglipayan adherents, no\r\nreliable figures are procurable from any source, but it is certain they\r\namount to thousands. I found Aglipayans as far south as Zamboanga. Just\r\na few priests ordained in the Roman Catholic Church have joined the\r\nschismatic cause. One of these repented and offered his submission\r\nto the administrator of the archbishopric (Father Martin Alcocer),\r\nwho pardoned his frailty and received him again into the Church. No\r\nperiod of preparation was necessary, at least in the beginning, for\r\nthe ordination of an Aglipayan priest. He might have been a domestic\r\nservant, an artisan, or a loafer shortly before; hence many would-be\r\nconverts refused to join when they saw their own or their friends'\r\nretainers suddenly elevated to the priesthood. At Yligan (Mindanao\r\nIs.) an American official arrested a man, tonsured and robed as\r\na priest in an Aglipayan procession, on a charge of homicide. In\r\n1904 they had not half a dozen well-built churches of their own, but\r\nmat-sheds for their meetings were to be seen in many towns. In the year\r\n1903 these sectarians made repeated raids on Roman Catholic property,\r\nand attempted to gain possession of the churches by force. Riots\r\nensued, religion seemed to be forgotten by both parties in the _melee_,\r\nand several were given time for reflection in prison. In April, 1904,\r\nat Talisay and Minglanilla (Cebu Is.), they succeeded in occupying\r\nthe churches and property claimed by the friars, and refused to vacate\r\nthem. In the following month an Aglipayan priest, Bonifacio Purganan,\r\nwas fined $25 for having taken forcible possession of the Chapel of\r\nPenafrancia (Paco suburb of Manila). In the province of Yloilo the\r\nAglipayans were forcibly ejected from the church of La Paz. In 1904\r\nthey entered a claim on the novel plea that, as many churches had\r\nbeen subscribed to or partially erected at their expense before they\r\nseceded from the Catholic Church, they were entitled to a restitution\r\nof their donations. The Catholics were anxious to have the contention\r\ndecided in a formal and definite manner, and the case was heard at the\r\nCourt of Guagua (Pampanga). The decision was against the sectarians,\r\non the ground that what had been once given for a specific purpose\r\ncould not be restored to the donor, or its application diverted from\r\nthe original channel, notwithstanding any subsequent change in the\r\nviews of the donor. It was probably in consequence of these disputes\r\nthat in January, 1905, the Secretary of War approved of a proposed\r\nAct of the Insular Government conferring authority upon the Supreme\r\nCourt of these Islands to hear cases relating to Church property\r\nclaims and pronounce a final decision thereon.\r\n\r\nUp to the middle of 1904 the particular doctrines of the Philippine\r\nIndependent Church were not yet defined, and the Aglipayans professed\r\nto follow the Roman ritual. It was intended, however, to introduce\r\nreforms of fundamental importance. For two days and a half I\r\ntravelled in company with the titular Aglipayan ecclesiastical\r\ngovernor of the Visayas, from whom I learnt much concerning the\r\nopinions of his sect. It appears that many are opposed to celibacy of\r\nthe clergy and auricular confession. My companion himself rejected\r\nthe biblical account of the Creation, the doctrine of original sin,\r\nhereditary responsibility, the deity of Christ, and the need for the\r\nAtonement. His conception of the relations between God and mankind\r\nwas a curious admixture of Darwinism and Rationalism; everything\r\nbeyond the scope of human reasoning had but a slender hold on his mind.\r\n\r\nIt is most probable that the majority of Aglipayans have given no\r\nthought as to the possible application of the power of union in this\r\nparticular form, and that their adhesion to the movement is merely a\r\nnatural reaction following the suppression of sacerdotal tyranny--an\r\nextravagant sense of untrammelled thought which time may modify by\r\nsober reflection when it is generally seen that the clergy of the\r\nRoman Catholic Church henceforth strictly limit themselves to the\r\nexercise of their proper functions. With the hope of re-establishing\r\npeace and conformity in the Church, His Holiness Pope Pius X. sent\r\nto the Islands his new Apostolic Delegate, Monsignor Ambrose Agius,\r\nwho reached Manila on February 6, 1905. [282]\r\n\r\nIt is doubtful whether the native parish priest, bereft of the\r\nwhite man's control, would have sufficient firmness of character to\r\novercome his own frailties and lead his flock in the true path. Under a\r\nPhilippine hierarchy there would be a danger of the natives reverting\r\nto paganism and fetichism. There have been many indications of that\r\ntendency from years back up to the present. Only a minority of native\r\nChristians seem to have grasped the true spirit of Christianity. All\r\nthat appeals to the eye in the rites and ceremonies impresses\r\nthem--the glamour and pomp of the procession attract them; they are\r\nvery fervent in outward observances, but ever prone to stray towards\r\nthe idolatrous. A pretended apparition of the Blessed Virgin is an old\r\nprofitable trick of the natives, practised as recently as December,\r\n1904, in the village of Namacpacan (Ilocos), where a woman, who\r\ndeclared the Virgin had appeared to her in the _form_ of the Immaculate\r\nConception and cured her bad leg, made a small fortune in conjunction\r\nwith a native priest. In May, 1904, a small party of fanatics was seen\r\non the Manila seashore going through some pseudo-religious antics,\r\nthe chief feature of which was a sea-bath. Profiting by the liberty\r\nof cult now existing, it is alleged that the spirits of the departed\r\nhave made known their presence to certain Filipinos. A native medium\r\nhas been found, and the pranks which the spirits are said to play\r\non those who believe in them have been practised, with all their\r\northodox frolic, on certain converts to the system. Tables dance\r\njigs, mysterious messages are received, and the conjuring celestials\r\nmanifest their power by displacing household articles. The _Coloram_\r\nsect of the southern Luzon provinces has, it is estimated, over\r\n50,000 adherents whose worship is a jumble of perverted Christian\r\nmysticism and idolatry. The _Baibailanes_ of Negros are not entirely\r\npagans; there is just a glimmer of Christian precept mingled in their\r\nbelief, whilst the scores of religious monomaniacs and saint-hawkers\r\nwho appear from time to time present only a burlesque imitation of\r\nchristian doctrine.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nGreat progress has been made in the direction of _Education_. [283]\r\nSchools of different grades have been established throughout the\r\nArchipelago, and the well-intentioned efforts of the Government have\r\nbeen responded to by the natives with an astonishing alacrity. Since\r\nSeptember 3, 1900, night-schools have also been opened for students\r\nto attend after their day's work. The natives exhibit great readiness\r\nto learn, many of them having already attained a very high standard--a\r\nfact which I had the opportunity of verifying through the courtesy of\r\nDr. David P. Barrows, the able General Superintendent of Education, and\r\nhis efficient staff. Both the higher schools and the night-schools are\r\nwell attended. A special eagerness to learn English is very apparent,\r\nand they acquire the language quickly up to a certain point. In\r\nSeptember, 1903, [284] out of the 934 towns in the Islands, 338 were\r\nsupplied with American teachers, the total number of teachers in the\r\nArchipelago being 691 Americans and 2,496 Filipinos. The night-schools\r\nwere attended by 8,595 scholars. The percentage of school-children who\r\nfrequented the day-schools was as follows: In Manila, 10 per cent.;\r\nin Nueva Vizcaya Province, 77 per cent. (the highest); and in Paragua\r\nIsland, 5 per cent. (the lowest). The average attendance throughout the\r\nprovinces was 13 per cent. of the total population of school-children.\r\n\r\nEducation has received the greatest solicitude of the Insular\r\nGovernment; and Dr. Barrows informed me that at the end of June,\r\n1904, there were 865 American teachers in the Islands (including about\r\n200 female teachers), 4,000 Philippine teachers of both sexes, and a\r\nschool attendance throughout the Colony of 227,600 children. For the\r\nyoungest children there are now seven kindergarten schools in Manila,\r\nand more applications for admission than can be satisfied.\r\n\r\nThe _Normal School_, situated in the Manila suburb of Ermita, is a\r\nsplendidly-equipped establishment, organized in the year 1901 with\r\na branch for training Filipinos to become teachers in the public\r\nschools. The buildings are four of those (including the main structure)\r\nwhich served for the Philippine Exhibition some years ago. They\r\ncontain an assembly hall, fourteen class-rooms, two laboratories,\r\nstore-rooms, and the principal's office. In the same suburb, close\r\nto the school, there is a dormitory for the accommodation of forty\r\ngirl boarders coming from the provinces. The school is open to both\r\nsexes on equal terms, subject to the presentation of a certificate\r\nof character and a preliminary examination to ascertain if they can\r\nunderstand written and spoken English and intelligibly express their\r\nthoughts in that language. The training covers four years, with the\r\nfollowing syllabus, viz.:--\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n    Algebra.\r\n    Arithmetic.\r\n    Botany.\r\n    Drawing.\r\n    English.\r\n    General History.\r\n    Geography.\r\n    Music.\r\n    Nature-study.\r\n    Philippine History.\r\n    Physics.\r\n    Physiology and Hygiene.\r\n    Professional Training.\r\n    United States History.\r\n    Zoology.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe training-class for children ranging from five to eleven years\r\nserves a double purpose by enabling student-teachers to put into\r\npractice the theory of professional training under supervision. For\r\nthe training of youths who intend to follow a trade, there is a branch\r\n_School of Arts and Trades_ equipped with class-rooms, workshops,\r\nmechanical and architectural drawing-rooms, and the allied branches\r\nof industry. The subjects taught are:--\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n    Architectural Drawing.\r\n    Blacksmithing.\r\n    Cabinet-making.\r\n    Carpentry.\r\n    Cooking.\r\n    Machine-shop Practice.\r\n    Mathematics.\r\n    Mechanical Drawing.\r\n    Plumbing.\r\n    Steam Engineering.\r\n    Stenography.\r\n    Telegraphy.\r\n    Tinsmithing.\r\n    Typewriting.\r\n    Wood-carving.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThere is also a night-class for those working in the daytime who\r\ndesire to extend their theoretical knowledge.\r\n\r\nThe _Nautical School_ (_vide_ p. 195), established in Spanish times,\r\nis continued with certain reforms, additions having been made to the\r\nequipment. American naval officers have undertaken its superintendence\r\nfrom time to time, and it is now under the direction of a civilian\r\ngraduate of the United States Naval Academy. The instruction ranges\r\nfrom history and geography to practical seamanship, with all the\r\nintermediate scientific subjects. Graduates of this school obtain\r\nthird-mate's certificates, and many of them are actually navigating\r\nin the waters of the Archipelago.\r\n\r\nA course of study in _Vocal Music_ is also offered to Normal School\r\nstudents, and this may possibly lead to the first discovery of a fine\r\nPhilippine musical voice.\r\n\r\nThere is also a _Public School for Chinese_ situated in the _Calle\r\nde la Asuncion_, in the business quarter of Binondo (Manila).\r\n\r\nIn the _Saint Thomas's University_ (_vide_ p. 194) there are few\r\nchanges. The diplomas now issued to students in Law and Medicine\r\nare only honorific. With or without this diploma a student must pass\r\nan examination at the centres established by the Americans for the\r\nfaculties of Law and Medicine before he can practise, and the same\r\nobligation applies to Americans who may arrive, otherwise qualified,\r\nin the Islands. Practical instruction in the healing art, or \"walking\r\nthe hospitals,\" as it is called in England, is given at the _San\r\nJuan de Dios Hospital_ as heretofore. The theoretical tuition in\r\nthese faculties is furnished at the _College of San Jose_. Besides\r\nthe Government schools, there are many others continuing the Spanish\r\nsystem, such as the _Colegio de San Juan de Dios_, where, besides\r\nthe usual subjects taught, the syllabus is as follows:--\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n    Commerce.\r\n    Drawing.\r\n    Japanese Language.\r\n    Modelling in Plaster.\r\n    Piano, Violin.\r\n    Sketching from Nature.\r\n    Stenography.\r\n    Typewriting.\r\n    Watercolouring.\r\n    And preparation for the B.A. examination.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe _Seminario Central de San Javier_, under Jesuit superintendence,\r\nis really intended for students proposing to enter the Church. Many,\r\nhowever, follow the course of study and enter civil life. In the\r\nlarge provincial towns there are Spanish schools, and at Dagupan the\r\n_Colegio Instituto_ follows the same curriculum as that established\r\nin the Manila _College of San Juan de Letran_. In Spanish times Jaro\r\nwas the educational centre of the Visayas Islands. Since the American\r\nadvent Yloilo has superseded Jaro in that respect, and a large school\r\nis about to be erected on 75 acres of land given by several generous\r\ndonors for the purpose. The system of education is uniform throughout\r\nthe Islands, where schools of all grades are established, and others\r\nare in course of foundation in every municipality. Including about\r\nP1,000,000 disbursed annually for the schools by the municipalities,\r\nthe cost of Education is about 20 per cent, of the total revenue--a\r\nsum out of all proportion to the taxpayers' ability to contribute.\r\n\r\nAccording to the Philippine Commission Act No. 1123, of April, 1904,\r\nthe official language will be English from January 1, 1906. It will\r\nbe used in court proceedings, and no person will be eligible for\r\nGovernment service who does not know that language.\r\n\r\nIn general the popular desire for education is very\r\npronounced. American opinion as to the capability of the Filipinos\r\nto attain a high degree of learning and _maintain_ it seems much\r\ndivided, for many return to America and publicly express pessimistic\r\nviews on this point. In daily conversation with young middle-class\r\nFilipinos one can readily see that the ambition of the majority is\r\nlimited to the acquisition of sufficient English to qualify them for\r\nGovernment employment or commercial occupations. The industries of\r\nthe Islands are relatively insignificant. The true source of their\r\nwealth is agriculture. In most, not to say all, tropical countries,\r\nthe educated native shuns manual labour, and with this tendency\r\ndominant in the Filipino, it is difficult to foresee what may happen\r\nas education advances. The history of the world shows that national\r\nprosperity has first come from industrial development, with the\r\ndesire and the need for education following as a natural sequence. To\r\nhave free intercourse with the outside world it is necessary to\r\nknow a European language. This is recognized even in Japan, where,\r\nnotwithstanding its independent nationality, half the best-educated\r\nclasses speak some European tongue. If the majority of the Filipinos\r\nhad understood Spanish at the period of the American advent, it might\r\nbe a matter of regret that this language was not officially preserved\r\non account of the superior beauty of all Latin languages; but such\r\nwas not the case. Millions still only speak the many dialects; and\r\nto carry out the present system of education a common speech-medium\r\nbecomes a necessity. However, generations will pass away before native\r\nidiom will cease to be the vulgar tongue, and the engrafted speech\r\nanything more than the official and polite language of the better\r\nclasses. The old belief of colonizing nations that European language\r\nand European dress alone impart civilization to the Oriental is an\r\nexploded theory. The Asiatic can be more easily moulded and subjected\r\nto the ways and the will of the white man by treating with him in his\r\nnative language. It is difficult to gain his entire confidence through\r\nthe medium of a foreign tongue. The Spanish friars understood this\r\nthoroughly. It is a deplorable fact that the common people of Asia\r\ngenerally acquire only the bad qualities of the European concurrently\r\nwith his language, lose many of their own natural characteristics,\r\nwhich are often charmingly simple, and become morally perverted.\r\n\r\nThe best native servants are those who can only speak their\r\nmother-tongue. In times past the rustic who came to speak Spanish\r\nwas loth to follow the plough. If an English farm labourer should\r\nlearn Spanish, perhaps he would be equally loth. One may therefore\r\nassume that if the common people should come to acquire the English\r\nlanguage, agricultural coolie labour would become a necessity. In\r\n1903 one hundred Philippine youths were sent, at Government expense,\r\nto various schools in America for a four-years' course of tuition. It\r\nis to be hoped that they will return to their homes impressed with\r\nthe dignity of labour and be more anxious to develop the natural\r\nresources of the country than to live at the expense of the taxpayers.\r\n\r\nSince the Rebellion, and especially since the American advent,\r\na great number of Filipinos have migrated to the adjacent British\r\ncolonies, China, Japan, America, and Europe. There is a small colony\r\nof rich Filipinos in Paris, and about 50 or 60 (principally students)\r\nin England. They have no nationality, and are officially described as\r\n\"Filipinos under the protection of the United States.\" When the Treaty\r\nof Paris was being negotiated, the Spanish Commissioners wished to have\r\nthe option of nationality conceded to all persons hitherto under the\r\ndominion of Spain in the ceded colonies; but the American Commissioners\r\nrejected the proposal, which might have placed their country in the\r\npeculiar position of administering a colony of foreigners.\r\n\r\nIn 1904 the Government sent selected groups of the different Philippine\r\nwild and semi-civilized races to the St. Louis Exhibition, where\r\nthey were on view for several months; also a Philippine Commission,\r\ncomposed of educated Filipinos, was sent, at public expense, to\r\nSt. Louis and several cities in America, including Washington,\r\nwhere the President received and entertained its members. Many of\r\nthe members of this Commission were chosen from what is called\r\nthe _Federal Party_. In the old days politics played no part in\r\nPhilippine life. The people were either anti-friar or conformists to\r\nthe _status quo_. The Revolution, however, brought into existence\r\nseveral distinct parties, and developed the natural disintegrating\r\ntendency of the Filipinos to split up into factions on any matter of\r\ncommon concern. The Spanish reform party, led by Pedro A. Paterno,\r\ncollapsed when all hope was irretrievably lost, and its leader passed\r\nover to Aguinaldo's party of sovereign independence. To-day there\r\nis practically only one organized party--the Federal--because there\r\nis no legislative assembly or authorized channel for the legitimate\r\nexpression of opposite views. The Federal Party, which is almost\r\nentirely anti-clerical, comprises all those who unreservedly endorse\r\nand accept American dominion and legislation. They are colloquially\r\nalluded to as \"Americanistas.\" Through the tempting offers of civil\r\nservice positions with emoluments large as compared with times\r\ngone by, many leading men have been attracted to this party, the\r\nsmarter half-caste predominating over the pure Oriental in the higher\r\nemployments. There are other groups, however, which may be called\r\nparties in embryo, awaiting the opportunity for free discussion in\r\nthe coining _Philippine Assembly_. [285] Present indications point to\r\nthe _Nationalists_ as the largest of these coming opposition parties,\r\nits present programme being autonomy under American protection. The\r\nmajority of those who clamour for \"independence\" [I am not referring\r\nto the masses, but to those who have thought the matter out in their\r\nown fashion] do not really understand what they are asking for, for\r\nit generally results from a close discussion of the subject that they\r\nare, in fact, seeking autonomy _dependent_ on American protection,\r\nwith little idea of what the Powers understand by Protection. In\r\na conversation which I had with the leader of the Nationalists, I\r\ninquired, \"What do you understand by independence?\" His reply was,\r\n\"Just a thread of connexion with the United States to keep us from\r\nbeing the prey of other nations!\" Other parties will, no doubt, be\r\nformed; and there will probably be, for some time yet, a small group\r\nof _Irreconcilables_ affiliated with those abroad who cannot return\r\nhome whilst they refuse to take the oath of allegiance prescribed in\r\nthe United States President's peace and amnesty proclamation, dated\r\nJuly 4, 1902. The Irreconcilables claim real sovereign independence for\r\nthe Filipinos; they would wish the Americans to abandon the Islands as\r\ncompletely as if they had never occupied them at all. It is doubtful\r\nwhether entire severance from American or European control would last\r\na year, because some other Power, Asiatic or European, would seize\r\nthe Colony. Sovereign independence would be but a fleeting vision\r\nwithout a navy superior in all respects to that of any second-rate\r\nnaval Power, for if all the fighting-men of the Islands were armed to\r\nthe teeth they could not effectively resist a simultaneous bombardment\r\nof their ports; nor could they, as inhabitants of an archipelago,\r\nbecome united in action or opinion, because their inter-communication\r\nwould be cut off. When this is explained to them, there are those who\r\nadmit the insuperable difficulty, and suggest, as a compromise, that\r\nAmerica's position towards them should be merely that of the policeman,\r\nstanding by ready to interfere if danger threatens them! This is the\r\nnaive definition of the relation which they (the Irreconcilables)\r\nterm \"Protection.\"\r\n\r\nHowever, the cry for \"independence\" has considerably abated since the\r\nSecretary of War, Mr. W. H. Taft, visited Manila in August, 1905,\r\nand publicly announced that America intended to retain the Islands\r\nfor an indefinitely long period. Before America relinquishes her hold\r\non the Colony (if ever) generations may pass away, and naturally the\r\nIrreconcilable, will disappear with the present one.\r\n\r\nThat the Filipinos would, if ever they obtain their independence, even\r\nthough it were a century hence, manage their country on the pattern\r\nset them by their tutors of to-day, is beyond all imagination. \"We want\r\nthem to learn to think as we do,\" an American minister is reported to\r\nhave said at a public meeting held in Washington in May, 1905. The\r\nlaudable aim of America to convert the Filipino into an American in\r\naction and sentiment will probably never be realized.\r\n\r\nWhy the Philippines should continue to be governed by a Commission\r\nis not clear to the foreign investigator. Collective government\r\nis inconsonant with the traditions and instincts of these Asiatic\r\npeople, who would intuitively fear and obey the arbitrary mandate of a\r\nparamount chief, whether he be called Nawab, Sultan, or Governor. Even\r\nas it is, the people have, in fact, looked more to the one man,\r\nthe Mr. Taft or the Mr. Wright as the case may be, than they have to\r\nthe Commission for the attainment of their hopes, and were there an\r\nuncontrolled native government, it would undoubtedly end in becoming\r\na one-man rule, whatever its title might be. The difficulty in making\r\nthe change does not lie in the choice of the man, because one most\r\neminently fitted for personal rule in the name of the United States\r\nof America (assisted by a Council) is in the Islands just now.\r\n\r\nThe Philippine Assembly, which is, conditionally, to be conceded\r\nto the Islanders in 1907, will be a Congress of deputies elected by\r\npopular vote; the Philippine Commission, more or less as at present\r\nconstituted, will be practically the Senate or controlling Upper\r\nHouse. The Filipinos will have no power to make laws, but simply to\r\npropose them, because any bill emanating from the popular assembly\r\ncan be rejected by the Upper House with an American majority. The\r\nPhilippine Assembly will be, in reality, a School of Legislature to\r\ntrain politicians for the possible future concession of complete\r\nself-government. In connexion with the public schools a course of\r\ninstruction in political economy prepares youths for the proper\r\nexercise of the right of suffrage on their attaining twenty-three\r\nyears of age. The studies include the Congress Law of July 1, 1902;\r\nPresident McKinley's Instruction to the Civil Commission of April 7,\r\n1900; Government of the United States, Colonial Government in European\r\nStates, and Parliamentary Law.\r\n\r\nThe question of the Filipinos' capacity for _self-government_ has been\r\nfrequently debated since the Rebellion of 1896. A quarter of a century\r\nago the necessary 500 or 600 Filipinos, half-caste in the majority,\r\ncould have been found with all the requisite qualifications for the\r\nformation of an intelligent oligarchy. The Constitution drawn up by\r\nApolinario Mabini, and proclaimed by the Malolos Insurgent Government\r\n(January 22, 1899), was a fair proof of intellectual achievement. But\r\nthat is not sufficient; the working of it would probably have been as\r\nsuccessful as the Government of Hayti, because the Philippine character\r\nis deficient in disinterested thought for the common good. There is\r\nno lack of able Filipinos quite competent to enact laws and dictate\r\nto the people what they are to do; but if things are to be reversed\r\nand the elected assembly is to be composed of deputies holding the\r\n_people's_ mandates, there will be plenty to do between now and March,\r\n1907, in educating the electors to the point of intelligently using the\r\nfranchise, uninfluenced by the _caciques_, who have hitherto dominated\r\nall public acts. According to the census of 1903, there were 1,137,776\r\nilliterate males of the voting age. In any case, independently of\r\nits legislative function, the Philippine Assembly will be a useful\r\nchannel for free speech. It will lead to the open discussion of the\r\ngeneral policy, the rural police, the trade regulations, the taxes,\r\nthe desirability of maintaining superfluous expensive bureaux, the\r\nlavish (Manila) municipal non-productive outlay, and ruinous projects\r\nof no public utility, such as the construction of the Benguet road,\r\n[286] etc.\r\n\r\nThe Act providing for a Philippine Assembly stipulates that the\r\nelected deputies shall not be less than 50 and not more than 100\r\nto represent the civilized portion of the following population,\r\nviz. [287]:--Civilized, 6,987,686; wild, 647,740; total, 7,635,426.

Other foreigners are permitted to enter the Philippines\r\n(conditionally), but all are required to pay an entrance fee (I had\r\nto pay $5.30 Mex.) before embarking (abroad) for a Philippine port,\r\nand make a declaration of 19 items, [290] of which the following\r\nare the most interesting to the traveller:--(1) Sex; (2) whether\r\nmarried or single; (3) who paid the passage-money; (4) whether\r\nin possession of $30 upward or less; (5) whether ever in prison;\r\n(6) whether a polygamist. The master or an officer of the vessel\r\ncarrying the passenger is required to make oath before the United\r\nStates Consul at the port of embarkation that he has made a \"personal\r\nexamination\" of his passenger, and does not believe him (or her) to\r\nbe either an idiot, or insane person, or a pauper, or suffering from\r\na loathsome disease, or an ex-convict, or guilty of infamous crime\r\ninvolving moral turpitude, or a polygamist, etc. The ship's doctor\r\nhas to state on oath that he has also made a \"personal examination\"\r\nof the passenger. If the vessel safely arrives in port, say Manila,\r\nshe will be boarded by a numerous staff of Customs' officials. In the\r\nmeantime the passenger will have been supplied with declaration-forms\r\nand a printed notice, stating that an \"Act provides a fine of not\r\nexceeding $2,000 or imprisonment at hard labour, for not more than\r\nfive years, or both, for offering a gratuity to an officer of the\r\nCustoms in consideration of any illegal act in connexion with the\r\nexamination of baggage.\" The baggage-declaration must be ready for the\r\nofficers, and, at intervals during an hour and a half, he (or she)\r\nhas to sign six different declarations as to whether he (or she)\r\nbrings fire-arms. The baggage is then taken to the Custom-house in\r\na steam-launch for examination, which is not unduly rigid. Under a\r\nPhilippine Commission Act, dated October 15, 1901, the Collector of\r\nCustoms, or his deputy, may, at his will, also require the passenger\r\nto take an oath of allegiance in such terms that, in the event of\r\nwar between the passenger's country and America, he who takes the\r\noath would necessarily have to forfeit his claim for protection\r\nfrom his own country, unless he violated that oath. No foreigner\r\nis permitted to land if he comes \"under a contract expressed, or\r\nimplied, to perform labour in the Philippine Islands.\" In 1903 this\r\nprohibition to foreigners was disputed by a British bank-clerk who\r\narrived in Manila for a foreign bank. The case was carried to court,\r\nwith the result that the prohibition was maintained in principle,\r\nalthough the foreigner in question was permitted to remain in the\r\nIslands as an act of grace. But in February, 1905, a singular case\r\noccurred, exactly the reverse of the one just mentioned. A young\r\nEnglishman who had been brought out to Manila on a four years'\r\nagreement, after four or five months of irregular conduct towards the\r\nfirm employing him, presented himself to the Collector of Customs\r\n(as Immigration Agent), informed against himself, and begged to be\r\ndeported from the Colony. The incentive for this strange proceeding\r\nwas to secure the informer's reward of $1,000. It was probably the\r\nfirst case in Philippine history of a person voluntarily seeking\r\ncompulsory expulsion from the Islands. The Government, acting on the\r\ninformation, shipped him off to Hong-Kong, the nearest British port,\r\nin the following month, with a through passage to Europe.\r\n\r\nSince the American advent the _Administration of Justice_ has been\r\ngreatly accelerated, and Municipal Court cases, which in Spanish times\r\nwould have caused more worry to the parties than they were worth, or,\r\nfor the same reason, would have been settled out of court violently,\r\nare now despatched at the same speed as in the London Police Courts. On\r\nthe other hand, quick despatch rather feeds the native's innate love\r\nfor litigation, so that an agglomeration of lawsuits is still one\r\nof the Government's undesirable but inevitable burdens. There is a\r\ncomplaint that the fines imposed in petty cases are excessive, and\r\nattention was drawn to this by the Municipality of Manila. [291] After\r\nstating that the fines imposed on 2,185 persons averaged $5 per capita,\r\nand that they had to go to prison for non-payment, the Municipality\r\nadds: \"It shows an excessive rigour on the part of the judges in the\r\nimposition of fines, a rigour which ought to be modified, inasmuch\r\nas the majority of the persons accused before the Court are extremely\r\npoor and ignorant of the ordinances and the laws for the violation of\r\nwhich they are so severely punished.\" Sentences of imprisonment and\r\nfines for high crimes are justly severe. During the governorship of\r\nMr. W. H. Taft, 17 American provincial treasurers were each condemned\r\nto 25 years' imprisonment for embezzlement of public funds. In\r\nFebruary, 1905, an army major, found guilty of misappropriation of\r\npublic moneys, had his sentence computed at 60 years, which term\r\nthe court reduced to 40 years' hard labour. The penalties imposed on\r\nsome rioters at Vigan in April, 1904, were death for two, 40 years'\r\nimprisonment and $10,000 fine each for twelve, 30 years' imprisonment\r\nfor thirty-one, and 10 years' imprisonment for twenty-five.\r\n\r\nThe American law commonly spoken of in the Philippines as the\r\n\"Law of Divorce\" is nothing more than judicial separation in its\r\nlocal application, as it does not annul the marriage and the parties\r\ncannot marry again as a consequence of the action. The same could be\r\nobtained under the Spanish law called the _Siete Partidas_, with the\r\nonly difference that before the _decree nisi_ was made absolute the\r\nparties might have had to wait for years, and even appeal to Home.\r\n\r\nOn May 26,1900, the Military Governor authorized the solemnization\r\nof marriages by any judge of a court inferior to the Supreme Court,\r\na justice of the peace, or a minister of any denomination. For the\r\nfirst time in the history of the Islands, _habeas corpus_ proceedings\r\nwere heard before the Supreme Court on May 19, 1900. Besides the\r\nlower courts established in many provincial centres, sessions are\r\nheld in circuit, each usually comprising two or three provinces. The\r\nprovinces are grouped into 16 judicial districts, in each of which\r\nthere is a Court of First Instance; and there is, moreover, one\r\nadditional \"Court of First Instance at large.\" The Chief Justice of\r\nthe Supreme Court, some of his assistant judges, several provincial\r\njudges, the Attorney-General, and many other high legal functionaries,\r\nare Filipinos. The provincial justices of the peace are also natives,\r\nand necessarily so because their office requires an intimate knowledge\r\nof native character and dialect. Their reward is the local prestige\r\nwhich they enjoy and the litigants' fees, and happily their services\r\nare not in daily request. At times the findings of these local\r\nluminaries are somewhat quaint, and have to be overruled by the more\r\nenlightened judicial authorities in the superior courts. Manila and\r\nall the judicial centres are amply supplied with American lawyers who\r\nhave come to establish themselves in the Islands, where the custom\r\nobtains for professional men to advertise in the daily newspapers. So\r\nfar there has been only one American lady lawyer, who, in 1904, held\r\nthe position of Assistant-Attorney in the Attorney-General's office.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXXI\r\n\r\nTrade and Agriculture Since the American Advent\r\n\r\n\r\nDuring the year 1898 there were those who enriched themselves\r\nenormously as a consequence of the American advent, but the\r\nstaple trade of the Colony was generally disrupted by the abnormal\r\ncircumstances of the period; therefore it would serve no practical\r\npurpose to present the figures for that year for comparison with the\r\nresults obtained in the years following that of the Treaty of Paris.\r\n\r\nThe tables at the end of this chapter show the increase or decrease in\r\nthe various branches of export and import trade. Regarded as a whole,\r\nthe volume of business has increased since the American occupation--to\r\nwhat extent will be apparent on reference to the table of \"Total Import\r\nand Export Values\" at p. 639. When the American army of occupation\r\nentered the Islands, and was subsequently increased to about 70,000\r\ntroops, occupying some 600 posts about the Archipelago, there came\r\nin their wake a number of enterprising business men, who established\r\nwhat were termed trading companies. Their transactions hardly affected\r\nthe prosperity of the Colony one way or the other. For this class of\r\ntrader times were brisk; their dealings almost exclusively related\r\nto the supply of commodities to the temporary floating population\r\nof Americans, with such profitable results that, although many of\r\nthem withdrew little by little when, at the close of the War of\r\nIndependence, the troops were gradually reduced to some 16,000 men,\r\noccupying about 100 posts, others had accumulated sufficient capital\r\nto continue business in the more normal time which followed. Those\r\nwere halcyon days for the old-established retailers as well as the\r\nnew-comers; but, as Governor W. H. Taft pointed out in his report\r\nto the Civil Commission dated December 23, 1903, [292] \"The natural\r\nhostility of the American business men, growing out of the war, was\r\nnot neutralized by a desire and an effort to win the patronage and\r\ngoodwill of the Filipinos. The American business men controlled much of\r\nthe advertising in the American papers, and the newspapers naturally\r\nreflected the opinion of their advertisers and subscribers in the\r\nadvocacy of most unconciliatory measures for the native Filipino,\r\nand in decrying all efforts of the Government to teach Filipinos\r\nhow to govern by associating the more intelligent of them in the\r\nGovernment.... The American business man in the Islands has really,\r\nup to this time, done very little to make or influence trade. He\r\nhas kept close to the American patronage, and has not extended his\r\nefforts to an expansion of trade among the Filipinos.... There are\r\na few Americans who have pursued a different policy with respect to\r\nthe Filipinos to their profit.\"\r\n\r\nGovernor Taft's comments were only intended to impress upon the\r\npermanent American traders, for their own good, the necessity\r\nof creating a new _clientele_ which they had neglected. The war\r\nfinished, the wave of temporarily abnormal prosperity gradually\r\nreceded with the withdrawal of the troops in excess of requirements;\r\nthe palmy days of the retailer had vanished, and all Manila began to\r\ncomplain of \"depression\" in trade. The true condition of the Colony\r\nbecame more apparent to them in their own slack time, and for want of\r\nreflection some began to attribute it to a want of foresight in the\r\nInsular Government. Industry is in its infancy in the Philippines,\r\nwhich is essentially an agricultural colony. The product of the soil\r\nis the backbone of its wealth. The true causes of the depression\r\nwere not within the control of the Insular Government or of any\r\nruling factor. Five years of warfare and its sequence--the bandit\r\ncommunity--had devastated the provinces. The peaceful pursuits of the\r\nhusbandman had been nearly everywhere interrupted thereby; his herds\r\nof buffaloes had been decimated in some places, in others annihilated;\r\nhis apparatus or machinery and farm buildings were destroyed, now\r\nby the common exigencies of war, now by the wantonness of the armed\r\nfactions. The remnant of the buffaloes was attacked by rinderpest,\r\nor _epizootia_, as the Filipino calls this disease, and in some\r\nprovinces up to 90 per cent. were lost. Some of my old friends\r\nassured me that, due to these two causes, they had lost every head\r\nof cattle they once possessed. Laudable effort was immediately made\r\nby the Insular Government to remedy the evil, for so great was the\r\nmortality that many agricultural districts were poverty-stricken,\r\nthousands of acres lying fallow for want of beasts for tillage and\r\ntransport. Washington responded to the appeal for help, and a measure\r\nwas passed establishing the Congressional Relief Fund, under which\r\nthe sum of $3,000,000 was authorized to be expended to ameliorate the\r\nsituation. By Philippine Commission Act No. 738, $100,000 of this\r\nfund were appropriated for preliminary expenses in the purchase of\r\nbuffaloes. Under the supervision of the Insular Purchasing-Agent a\r\ncontract was entered into with a Shanghai firm for the supply of 10,000\r\nhead of inoculated buffaloes to be delivered in Manila, at the rate\r\nof 500 per month, at the price of P85 per head. An agent was sent to\r\nShanghai with powers to reject unsuitable beasts before inoculation,\r\nand the Government undertook to remunerate the contractors at the rate\r\nof P40 for every animal which succumbed to the operation. The loss on\r\nthis process was so great that a new contract was entered into with the\r\nsame firm to deliver in Manila temporarily immunized buffaloes at the\r\nrate of P79 per head. On their arrival the animals were inspected, and\r\nthose apparently fit were herded on the Island of Masbate for further\r\nobservation before disposing of them to the planters. The attempt\r\nwas a failure. Rinderpest, or some other incomprehensible disease,\r\naffected and decimated the imported herds. From beginning to end the\r\ninevitable wastage was so considerable that up to November 20, 1903,\r\nonly 1,805 buffaloes (costing P118,805) were purchased, out of which\r\n1,370 were delivered alive, and of this number 429 died whilst under\r\nobservation; therefore, whereas the price of the 1,805 averaged\r\nP65 per head, the cost exceeded P126 per head when distributed\r\nover the surviving 941, which were sold at less than cost price,\r\nalthough in private dealings buffaloes were fetching P125 to P250\r\nper head (_vide_ Buffaloes p. 337, et seq.). Veterinary surgeons and\r\ninoculators were commissioned to visit the buffaloes privately owned\r\nin the planting-districts, the Government undertaking to indemnify\r\nthe owners for loss arising from the compulsory inoculation; but this\r\nhas not sufficed to stamp out the disease, which is still prevalent.\r\n\r\nAnother calamity, common in British India, but unknown in these\r\nIslands before the American advent, is _Surra_, a glandular disease\r\naffecting horses and ponies, which has made fatal ravages in the pony\r\nstock--to the extent, it is estimated, of 60 per cent. The pony which\r\nfully recovers from this disease is an exceptional animal. Again,\r\nthe mortality among the field hands, as a consequence of the war,\r\nwas supplemented by an outbreak of _Cholera morbus_ (_vide_ p. 197),\r\na disease which recurs periodically in these Islands, and which was,\r\non the occasion following the war, of unusually long duration. Together\r\nwith these misfortunes, a visitation of myriads of locusts (_vide_\r\np. 341) and drought completed the devastation.\r\n\r\nConsequent on the total loss of capital invested in live-stock, and\r\nthe fear of rinderpest felt by the minority who have the wherewithal\r\nto replace their lost herds, there is an inclination among the\r\nagriculturists to raise those crops which need little or no animal\r\nlabour. Hence sugar-cane and rice-paddy are being partially abandoned,\r\nwhilst all who possess hemp or cocoanut plantations are directing\r\ntheir special attention to these branches of land-produce. Due to these\r\ncircumstances, the increased cost of labour and living in the Islands\r\nsince the American advent, the want of a duty-free entry for Philippine\r\nsugar into the United States, the prospective loss of the Japanese\r\nmarket, [293] the ever-accumulating capital indebtedness, and the\r\nneed of costly machinery, it is possible to believe that sugar will,\r\nin time, cease to be one of the leading staple products of the Islands.\r\n\r\nWith regard to the duty levied in the United States on Philippine\r\nsugar imports, shippers in these Islands point out how little it\r\nwould affect either the United States' revenue or the sugar trade if\r\nthe duty were remitted in view of the extremely small proportion of\r\nPhilippine sugar to the total consumption in America. For instance,\r\ntaking the average of the five years 1899-1903, the proportion was\r\n.313 per cent., so that if in consequence of the remission of duty\r\nthis Philippine industry were stimulated to the extent of being able\r\nto ship to America threefold, it would not amount to 1 per cent,\r\nof the total consumption in that country.\r\n\r\nAt the close of the 1903 sugar season the planters were more deeply\r\nin debt than at any previous period in their history. In 1904 the\r\nmanager of an Yloilo firm (whom I have known from his boyhood)\r\nshowed me statistics proving the deplorable financial position of\r\nthe sugar-growers, and informed me that his firm had stopped further\r\nadvances and closed down on twelve of the largest estates working on\r\nborrowed capital, because of the hopelessness of eventual liquidation\r\nin full. For the same reasons other financiers have closed their\r\ncoffers to the sugar-planters.\r\n\r\nAnother object of the grant called the Congressional Relief Fund was\r\nto alleviate the distress prevailing in several Luzon provinces,\r\nparticularly Batangas, on account of the scarcity of rice, due,\r\nin a great measure, to the causes already explained. Prices of the\r\nimported article had already reached double the normal value in former\r\ntimes, and the Government most opportunely intervened to check the\r\noperations of a syndicate which sought to take undue advantage of\r\nthe prevailing misery. Under Philippine Commission Acts Nos. 495,\r\n786 and 797, appropriations were made for the purchase of rice for\r\ndistribution in those provinces where the speculator's ambition had\r\nrun up the selling-price to an excessive rate. Hitherto the chief\r\nsupplying-market had been the French East Indies, but the syndicate\r\nreferred to contrived to close that source to the Government, which,\r\nhowever, succeeded in procuring deliveries from other places. The\r\ntotal amount distributed was 11,164 tons, costing P1,081,722. About\r\n22 tons of this amount was given to the indigent class, the rest\r\nbeing delivered at cost price, either in cash or in payment for the\r\nextermination of locusts, or for labour in road-making and other public\r\nworks. The merchant class contended that this act of the Government,\r\nwhich deprived them of anticipated large profits, was an interference\r\nin private enterprise--a point on which the impartial reader must\r\nform his own conclusions. To obviate a recurrence of the necessity\r\nfor State aid, the Insular Government passed an Act urging the people\r\nto hasten the paddy-planting. The proclamation embodying this Act\r\npermitted the temporary use of municipal lands, the seed supplied\r\nto be repaid after the crop. It is said that some of the local\r\nnative councils, misunderstanding the spirit of the proclamation,\r\nmade its non-observance a criminal offence, and incarcerated many\r\nof the supposed offenders; but they were promptly released by the\r\nAmerican authorities.\r\n\r\nUnder the circumstances set forth, the cultivation of rice in the\r\nIslands has fallen off considerably, to what extent may be partially\r\ngathered from a glance at the enormous imports of this cereal, which\r\nin the year 1901~ were 167,951 tons; in 1902, 285,473 tons; in 1903,\r\n329,055 tons (one-third of the value of the total imports in that\r\nyear); and in 1904, 261,553 tons. The large increase of wages and\r\ntaxes and the high cost of living since the American advent (rice in\r\n1904 cost about double the old price) have reduced the former margins\r\nof profit on sugar and rice almost to the vanishing-point.\r\n\r\nIf all the land in use now, or until recently, for paddy-raising were\r\nsuitable for the cultivation of such crops as hemp, tobacco, cocoanuts,\r\netc., for which there is a steady demand abroad, the abandonment of\r\nrice for another produce which would yield enough to enable one to\r\npurchase rice, and even leave a margin of profit, would be rather an\r\nadvantage than otherwise. But this is not the case, and naturally a\r\nnative holds on to the land he possesses in the neighbourhood, where\r\nhe was perhaps born, rather than go on a peregrination in search\r\nof new lands, with the risk of semi-starvation during the dilatory\r\nprocess of procuring title-deeds for them when found.\r\n\r\nFortunately for the Filipinos, \"Manila hemp\" being a speciality\r\nof this region as a fibre of unrivalled quality and utility, there\r\ncannot be foreseen any difficulty in obtaining a price for it which\r\nwill compensate the producer to-day as well as it did in former\r\ntimes. Seeing that buffaloes can be dispensed with in the cultivation\r\nof hemp and coprah, which, moreover, are products requiring no\r\nexpensive and complicated machinery and are free of duty into the\r\nUnited States, they are becoming the favourite crops of the future.\r\n\r\nIn 1905 there was considerable agitation in favour of establishing a\r\nGovernment Agricultural Bank, which would lend money to the planters,\r\ntaking a first mortgage on the borrower's lands as guarantee. In\r\nconnexion with this scheme, the question was raised whether the\r\nGovernment could, in justice, collect revenue from the people who had\r\nno voice at all in the Government, and then lend it out to support\r\nprivate enterprise. Moreover, without a law against usury (so common in\r\nthe Islands) there would be little to prevent a man borrowing from the\r\nbank at, say, 6 per cent.--up to the mortgage value of his estate--to\r\nlend it out to others at 60 per cent. A few millions of dollars,\r\nsubscribed by private capitalists and loaned out to the planters,\r\nwould enormously benefit the agricultural development of the Colony;\r\nand if native wealthy men would demonstrate their confidence in the\r\nresult by subscribing one-tenth of the necessary amount, perhaps\r\nAmericans would be induced to complete the scheme. The foreign banks\r\nestablished in the Islands are not agricultural, but exchange banks,\r\nand any American-Philippine Agricultural Bank which may be established\r\nneed have little reason to fear competition with foreign firms who\r\nremember the house of Russell & Sturgis (_vide_ p. 255) and also\r\nhave their own more recent experiences. Philippine rural land is a\r\ndoubtful security for loans, there being no free market in it.\r\n\r\nBetween the years 1902 and 1904 the Insular Government confiscated the\r\narable lands of many planters throughout the Islands for delinquency\r\nin taxes. The properties were put up to auction; some of them\r\nfound purchasers, but the bulk of them remained in the ownership of\r\nthe Government, which could neither sell them nor make any use of\r\nthem. Therefore an Act was passed in February, 1905, restoring to\r\ntheir original owners those lands not already sold, on condition of\r\nthe overdue taxes being paid within the year. In one province of Luzon\r\nthe confiscated lots amounted to about one-half of all the cultivated\r\nland and one-third of the rural land-assessment in that province. The\r\n$2,400,000 gold spent on the Benguet road (_vide_ p. 615) would have\r\nbeen better employed in promoting agriculture.\r\n\r\nUp to 1898 Spain was the most important market for Philippine tobacco,\r\nbut since that country lost her colonies she has no longer any\r\npatriotic interest in dealing with any particular tobacco-producing\r\ncountry. The entry of Philippine tobacco into the United States is\r\nchecked by a Customs duty, respecting which there is, at present,\r\na very lively contest between the tobacco-shippers in the Islands and\r\nthe Tobacco Trust in America, the former clamouring for, and the latter\r\nagainst, the reduction or abolition of the tariff. It is simply a clash\r\nof trade interests; but, with regard to the broad principles involved,\r\nit would appear that, so long as America holds these Islands without\r\nthe consent of its inhabitants, it is only just that she should do all\r\nin her power to create a free outlet for the Islands' produce. If this\r\nArchipelago should eventually acquire sovereign independence, America's\r\nmoral obligations towards it would cease, and the mutual relations\r\nwould then be only those ordinarily subsisting between two nations.\r\n\r\nBy Philippine Commission Act dated April 30, 1902, a Bureau of\r\nAgriculture was organized. The chief of this department is assisted\r\nby experts in soil, farm-management, plant-culture, breeding, animal\r\nindustry, seed and fibres, an assistant agrostologist, and a tropical\r\nagriculturist. Shortly after its organization, 18,250 packages of\r\nfield and garden seeds were sent to 730 individuals for experiment\r\nin different parts of the Colony, with very encouraging results. The\r\nwork of this department is experimental and investigative, with a\r\nview to the improvement of agriculture in all its branches.\r\n\r\nIn Spanish times agricultural land was free of taxation. Now it pays a\r\ntax not exceeding .87 per cent. of the assessed value. The rate varies\r\nin different districts, according to local circumstances. For instance,\r\nin 1904 it was .87 per cent. in Baliuag (Bulacan) and in Vinan (La\r\nLaguna), and .68 per cent. in San Miguel de Mayumo (Bulacan). This tax\r\nis subdivided in its application to provincial and municipal general\r\nexpenses and educational disbursements. The people make no demur\r\nat paying a tax on land-produce; but they complain of the system of\r\ntaxation of capital generally, and particularly of its application to\r\nlands lying fallow for the causes already explained. The approximate\r\nyield of the land-tax in the fiscal year of 1905 was P2,000,000; it\r\nwas then proposed to suspend the levy of this tax for three years in\r\nview of the agricultural depression.\r\n\r\nThe Manila Port Works (_vide_ p. 344), commenced in Spanish times, are\r\nnow being carried on more vigorously under contract with the Atlantic,\r\nGulf, and Pacific Company. Within the breakwater a thirty-foot deep\r\nharbour, measuring about 400 acres, is being dredged, the mud raised\r\ntherefrom being thrown on to 168 acres of reclaimed land which is to\r\nform the new frontage. Also a new channel entrance to the Pasig River\r\nis to be maintained at a depth of 18 feet. The Americans maintain\r\nthat there will be no finer harbour in the Far East when the work is\r\ncompleted. The reclaimed acreage will be covered with warehouses and\r\nwharves, enabling vessels to load and discharge at all seasons instead\r\nof lying idle for weeks in the typhoon season and bad weather, as they\r\noften do now. With these enlarged shipping facilities, freights to\r\nand from Manila must become lower, to the advantage of all concerned\r\nin import and export trade. The cost of these improvements up to\r\ncompletion is estimated at about one million sterling.\r\n\r\nThe port of Siassi (Tapul group), which was opened in recent years by\r\nthe Spaniards, was discontinued (June 1, 1902) by the Americans, who\r\nopened the new coastwise ports of Cape Melville, Puerta Princesa, and\r\nBongao (October 15, 1903) in order to assist the scheme for preventing\r\nsmuggling between these extreme southern islands and Borneo. Hitherto\r\nthere had been some excuse for this surreptitious trade, because\r\ninter-island vessels, trading from the other entry-ports, seldom,\r\nif ever, visited these out-of-the-way regions. In February, 1903,\r\nappropriations of $350,000 and $150,000 were made for harbour works in\r\nCebu and Yloilo respectively, although in the latter port no increased\r\nfacility for the entry of vessels into the harbour was apparent up to\r\nJune, 1904. Zamboanga, the trade of which was almost nominal up to the\r\nyear 1898, is now an active shipping centre of growing importance,\r\nwhere efforts are being made to foster direct trade with foreign\r\neastern ports. An imposing Custom-house is to be erected on the new\r\nspacious jetty already built under American auspices. Arrangements\r\nhave also been made for the Hong-Kong-Australia Steamship Company to\r\nmake Zamboanga a port of call. Here, as in all the chief ports of the\r\nArchipelago, greater advantages for trade have been afforded by the\r\nadministration, and one is struck with the appearance of activity and\r\nbriskness as compared with former times. These changes are largely\r\nowing to the national character of the new rulers, for one can enter\r\nany official department, in any branch of public service, from that\r\nof the Gov.-General downwards, to procure information or clear up a\r\nlittle question \"while you wait,\" and, if necessary, interview the\r\nchief of the department. The tedious, dilatory time and money-wasting\r\n\"come later on\" procedure of times gone by no longer obtains.\r\n\r\nWhat is still most needed to give a stimulus to agriculture and the\r\ngeneral material development of the Islands is the conversion of\r\nhundreds of miles of existing highways and mud-tracks into good hard\r\nroads, so as to facilitate communication between the planting-districts\r\nand the ports. The corallaceous stone abounding in the Islands is\r\nworthless for road-making, because it pulverizes in the course of one\r\nwet season, and, unfortunately, what little hard stone exists lies\r\nchiefly in inaccessible places--hence its extraction and transport\r\nwould be more costly than the supply of an equal quantity of broken\r\ngranite brought over in sailing-ships from the Chinese coast, where\r\nit is procurable at little over the quarryman's labour. From the days\r\nof the Romans the most successful colonizing nations have regarded\r\nroad-making as a work of primary importance and a civilizing factor.\r\n\r\nAmong the many existing projects, there is one for the construction\r\nof railroads (1) from Manila (or some point on the existing railway)\r\nnorthward through the rich tobacco-growing valleys of Isabela and\r\nCagayan, as far as the port of Aparri, at the mouth of the Cagayan\r\nRiver--distance, 260 miles; (2) from Dagupan (Pangasinan) to Laoag\r\n(Ilocos Norte), through 168 miles of comparatively well-populated\r\ncountry; (3) from San Fabian (Pangasinan) to Baguio (Benguet), 55\r\nmiles; and three other lines in Luzon Island and one in each of the\r\nislands of Negros, Panay, Cebu, Leyte, and Samar. A railway line from\r\nManila to Batangas, _via_ Calamba (a distance of about 70 miles), and\r\nthence on to Albay Province, was under consideration for many years\r\nprior to the American advent; but the poor financial result of the only\r\n(120 miles) line in the Colony has not served to stimulate further\r\nenterprise in this direction, except an endeavour of that same company\r\nto recuperate by feeder branches, two of which are built, and another\r\n(narrow gauge) is in course of construction from Manila to Antipolo,\r\n_via_ Pasig and Mariquina (_vide_ Railways, p. 265).\r\n\r\nSince February, 1905, a Congress Act, known as the \"Cooper Bill,\"\r\noffers certain inducements to railway companies. It authorizes the\r\nInsular Government to guarantee 4 per cent, annual interest on railway\r\nundertakings, provided that the total of such contingent liability\r\nshall not exceed $1,200,000--that is to say, 4 per cent, could be\r\nguaranteed on a maximum capital of $30,000,000. The Insular Government\r\nis further empowered under this Act to admit, at its discretion, the\r\nentry of railway material free of duty. As yet, no railway construction\r\nhas been started by American capitalists. Projects _ad infinitum_ might\r\nbe suggested for the development of trade and traffic--for instance, a\r\nship-canal connecting the Laguna de Bay with the Pacific Ocean; another\r\nfrom Laguimanoc to Atimonan (Tayabas); an artificial entry-port in\r\nNegros Island, connected by railway with two-thirds of the coast, etc.\r\n\r\nUp to the present the bulk of the export and import trade is handled\r\nby Europeans, who, together with native capitalists, own the most\r\nconsiderable commercial and industrial productive \"going concerns\"\r\nin the Islands. In 1904 there were one important and several\r\nsmaller American trading-firms (exclusive of shopkeepers) in the\r\ncapital, and a few American planters and successful prospectors in\r\nthe provinces. There are hundreds of Americans about the Islands,\r\nsearching for minerals and other natural products with more hopeful\r\nprospects than tangible results. It is perhaps due to the disturbed\r\ncondition of the Islands and the \"Philippines for the Filipinos\"\r\npolicy that the anticipated flow of private American capital has\r\nnot yet been seen, although there is evidently a desire in this\r\ndirection. There is, at least, no lack of the American enterprising\r\nspirit, and, since the close of the War of Independence, several\r\njoint-stock companies have started with considerable cash capital,\r\nprincipally for the exploitation of the agricultural, forestal, and\r\nmineral wealth of the Islands. Whatever the return on capital may\r\nbe, concerns of this kind, which operate at the natural productive\r\nsources, are obviously as beneficial to the Colony as trading can be\r\nin Manila--the emporium of wealth produced elsewhere.\r\n\r\nThere are, besides, many minor concerns with American capital,\r\nestablished only for the purpose of selling to the inhabitants goods\r\nwhich are not an essential need, and therefore not contributing to\r\nthe development of the Colony.\r\n\r\nThe tonnage entered in Philippine ports shows a rapid annual increase\r\nin five years. Many new lines of steamers make Manila a port of call,\r\nexclusive of the army transports, carrying Government supplies,\r\nand in 1905 there was a regular goods and passenger traffic between\r\nHong-Kong and Zamboanga. Still, the greater part of the freight\r\nbetween the Philippines and the Atlantic ports is carried in foreign\r\nbottoms. The shipping-returns for the year 1903 would appear to show\r\nthat over 85 per cent, of the exports from the Islands to America,\r\nand about the same proportion of the imports from that country\r\n(exclusive of Government stores brought in army transports) were\r\nborne in foreign vessels. The carrying-trade figures for 1904 were\r\n78.41 per cent, in British bottoms; 6.69 per cent, in Spanish,\r\nand 6.65 per cent, in American vessels. The desire to dispossess\r\nthe foreigners of the carrying monopoly is not surprising, but it\r\nis thought that immediately-operative legislation to that end would\r\nbe impracticable. The latest legislation on the subject confines the\r\ncarrying-trade between the Islands and the United States to American\r\nbottoms from July 1, 1906. It is alleged that the success of the new\r\nregulations which may (or may not, for want of American vessels)\r\ncome into force on that date will depend on the freights charged;\r\nit is believed that exorbitant outward rates would divert the hemp\r\ncargoes into other channels, and a large rise in inward freights\r\nwould facilitate European competition in manufactured goods. Any\r\nconsiderable rise in freights to America would tend to counterbalance\r\nthe benefits which the Filipinos hope to derive from the free entry\r\nof sugar and tobacco into American ports. The text of the Shipping\r\nLaw, dated April 15, 1904, reads thus; \"On and after July 1, 1906, no\r\nmerchandise shall be transported by sea, under penalty of forfeiture\r\nthereof, between ports of the United States and ports or places of\r\nthe Philippine Archipelago, directly, or _via_ a foreign port, or\r\nfor any part of the voyage in any other than a vessel of the United\r\nStates. No foreign vessel shall transport passengers between ports of\r\nthe United States and ports or places in the Philippine Archipelago,\r\neither directly, or _via_ a foreign port, under a penalty of $200\r\nfor each passenger so transported and landed.\"\r\n\r\nThe expenses of the Civil Government are met through the insular\r\nrevenues (the Congressional Relief Fund being an extraordinary\r\nexception). The largest income is derived from the Customs'\r\nreceipts, which in 1904 amounted to about $8,750,000, equal to about\r\ntwo-thirds of the insular treasury revenue (as distinguished from the\r\nmunicipal). The total _Revenue and Expenditure_ in the fiscal year\r\n1903 (from all sources, including municipal taxes expended in the\r\nrespective localities, but exclusive of the Congressional Relief Fund)\r\nstood thus:--\r\n\r\n\r\nTotal Revenue                           $14,640,988\r\nTotal Expenditure                                     $15,105,374\r\nExcess of Expenditure over Revenue          464,386\r\n                                         ==========    ==========\r\n                                         15,105,374    15,105,374\r\n\r\n\r\nIn 1903, therefore, Government cost the inhabitants the equivalent\r\nof about 46 per cent, of the exports' value, against 45 per cent, in\r\nSpanish times, taking the relative averages of 1890-94. The present\r\nabnormal pecuniary embarrassment of the people is chiefly due to the\r\ncauses already explained, and perhaps partly so to the fact that the\r\nP30,000,000 to P40,000,000 formerly in circulation had two to three\r\ntimes the local purchasing value that pesos have to-day.\r\n\r\nThe \"Cooper Bill,\" already referred to, authorizes the Insular\r\nGovernment to issue bonds for General Public Works up to a total of\r\n$5,000,000, for a term of 30 years, at 4 1/2 per cent, interest per\r\nannum; and the municipalities to raise loans for municipal improvements\r\nup to a sum not exceeding 5 per cent. of the valuation of the real\r\nestate of the municipalities, at 5 per cent. interest per annum. For\r\nthe purchase of the friars' lands a loan of $7,000,000 exists, bearing\r\ninterest at 4 per cent. per annum, the possible interest liability\r\non the total of these items amounting to about $2,000,000 per annum.\r\n\r\nOn November 15, 1901, the high Customs tariff then in force was reduced\r\nby about 25 per cent. on the total average, bringing the average duties\r\nto about 17 per cent. _ad valorem_, but this was again amended by the\r\nnew tariff laws of May 3, 1905. Opium is still one of the imports,\r\nbut under a recent law its introduction is to be gradually restricted\r\nby tariff until March 1, 1908, from which date it will be unlawful to\r\nimport this drug, except by the Government for medicinal purposes only.\r\n\r\nOn August 1, 1904, a new scheme of additional taxation came into\r\nforce under the \"Internal Revenue Law of 1904.\" This tax having been\r\nonly partially imposed during the first six months, the full yield\r\ncannot yet be ascertained, but at the present rate(P5,280,970.96,\r\npartial yield for the fiscal year 1905) it will probably produce at\r\nthe annual rate of $4,250,000 gold, which, however, is not entirely\r\nextra taxation, taking into account the old taxes repealed under\r\nArt. XVII., sec. 244. The theory of the new scheme was that it\r\nmight permit of a lower Customs tariff schedule. The new taxes are\r\nimposed on distilled spirits, fermented liquors, manufactured tobacco,\r\nmatches, banks and bankers, insurance companies, forestry products,\r\nvalid mining concessions granted prior to April 11, 1899, business,\r\nmanufactures, occupations, licences, and stamps on specified objects\r\n(Art. II., sec. 25). Of the taxes accruing to the Insular Treasury\r\nunder the above law, 10 per cent. is set apart for the benefit\r\nof the several provincial governments, apportioned _pro rata_ to\r\ntheir respective populations as shown by the census of 1903; 15 per\r\ncent. for the several municipal governments, provided that of this\r\nsum one-third shall be utilized solely for the maintenance of free\r\npublic primary schools and expenditure appertaining thereto. In the\r\naforesaid distribution Manila City ranks as a municipality and a\r\nprovince, and receives apportionment under this law on the basis of\r\n25 per cent. (Art. XVII., sec. 150).\r\n\r\nFrom the first announcement of the projected law up to its promulgation\r\nthe public clamoured loudly against it. For months the public\r\norgans, issued in Spanish and dialect, persistently denounced it as a\r\nharbinger of ruin to the Colony. Chambers of Commerce, corporations and\r\nprivate firms, foreign and native, at meetings specially convened to\r\ndiscuss the new law, predicted a collapse of Philippine industry and\r\ncommerce. At a public conference, held before the Civil Commission on\r\nJune 24, 1904, it was stated that one distillery alone would have to\r\npay a yearly tax of P744,000, and that a certain cigar-factory would\r\nbe required to pay annually P557,425. Petitions against the coming\r\nlaw were sent by all the representative trading-bodies to the Insular\r\nGovernment praying for its withdrawal. When the Commissioners retired\r\nto their hill-station at Baguio (Benguet) they were followed up by\r\nprotests against the measure, but it became law under Philippine\r\nCommission Act No. 1189. Since the imposition of this tax there\r\nhas been a general complaint throughout the civilized provinces of\r\ndepression in the internal trade, but to what extent it is justified\r\nthere is no available precise data on which to form an estimate.\r\n\r\nAs already stated, the American occupation brought about a rapid\r\nrise in the price of everything, not of necessity or in obedience\r\nto the law of supply and demand, but because it was the pleasure\r\nof the Americans voluntarily to enhance established values. To the\r\nsurprise of the Filipinos, the new-comers preferred to pay wages\r\nat hitherto unheard-of rates, whilst the soldiers lavishly paid in\r\ngold for silver-peso value (say, at least, double), of their own\r\nvolition--an innovation in which the obliging native complacently\r\nacquiesced, until it dawned upon him that he might demand anything he\r\nchose. The soldiers so frequently threw away copper coin given them in\r\nchange as valueless, that many natives discontinued to offer it. It\r\nfollowed that everybody was reluctantly compelled to pay the higher\r\nprice which the American spontaneously elected to give. Labour, food,\r\nhouse-rent, and all the necessaries of life rose enormously. [294]\r\nThe Colony soon became converted from a cheap into an expensive place\r\nof residence. Living there to-day costs at least three times what\r\nit did in Spanish times. Urban property and lands were assessed at\r\nvalues far beyond those at which the owners truly estimated them. Up\r\nto 1904 it was not at all uncommon to find the rent of a house raised\r\nto five times that of 1898. Retailers had to raise their prices;\r\ntrading-firms were obliged to increase their clerks' emoluments,\r\nand in every direction revenue and expenditure thenceforth ranged on\r\nan enhanced scale. It is remarkable that, whilst pains were taken by\r\nthe new-comers to force up prices, many of them were simultaneously\r\ncomplaining of expensive living! Governor W. H. Taft, with an annual\r\nemolument of $20,000 gold, declared before the United States Senate\r\nthat the Gov.-General's palace at Malacanan was too expensive a place\r\nfor him to reside in. The lighting of the establishment cost him $125\r\ngold a month, and his servants' wages amounted to $250 monthly. He\r\nadded that he would rather pay his own rent than meet the expenses\r\nof the Malacanan residence. [295]\r\n\r\nTwo and a half years later General Leonard Wood reported:\r\n\r\n\"There has been a great increase in the cost of living and in wages\r\nin this (Moro) as in other provinces--an increase which has not been\r\naccompanied either by improved methods or increased production. The\r\ncause of the increase can be traced, in most cases, to the _foolishly\r\nhigh prices paid_ by army officials for labour.\" [296]\r\n\r\nWages steadily advanced as a natural consequence of the higher cost\r\nof living, and, under the guidance of a native demagogue, the working\r\nclasses, for the first time in Philippine history, collectively began\r\nto grumble at the idea of labour-pay having a limit. It was one of\r\nthe abuses of that liberty of speech suddenly acquired under the new\r\ndominion. On February 2, 1902, this person organized the malcontents\r\nunder the title of a \"Labour Union,\" of which he became the first\r\npresident. The subscription was 20 cents of a peso per week. The\r\nlegality of peacefully relinquishing work when the worker felt so\r\ninclined was not impugned; but when the strikers sought to coerce\r\nviolently their fellow-men, the law justly interfered and imprisoned\r\ntheir leader. The presidency of the so-called \"Labour Union\" was\r\nthenceforth (September following) carried on by a half-caste, gifted\r\nwith great power of organization and fluent oratory. He prepared the\r\nby-laws of the association, and fixed the monthly subscription at one\r\npeso per man and one peseta (one-fifth of a peso) per woman. About\r\n100,000 members were enrolled in the union, the ostensible aim of\r\nwhich was the defence of the working man's interests. It is difficult\r\nto discern what those interests were which needed protection; the\r\nposition of the labouring class was the very reverse of that existing\r\nin Europe; the demand for labourers, at any reasonable wage, exceeded\r\nthe supply. The idea of a Filipino philanthropically devoting his\r\nlife to the welfare of the masses was beyond the conception of all who\r\nunderstood the Philippine character. At the end of about eight months,\r\nnotwithstanding the enormous assets from subscriptions, the \"Labour\r\nUnion\" became insolvent, with a deficit of 1,000 or more pesos. Where\r\nthe assets had gone needed investigation. In the meantime the leader,\r\nposing as mediator between the Insular Government and certain notorious\r\noutlaws, had endeavoured to negotiate with Governor W. H. Taft for\r\ntheir surrender, on the condition of full pardon. The Government, at\r\nlength, becoming suspicious of his intentions and the full measure of\r\nhis sympathy for these individuals, caused the leader to be arrested on\r\nMay 29, 1903, on the allegations of \"founding, directing, and presiding\r\nover an illegal association known as 'The Democratic Labour Union,'\"\r\nirregularities connected with the foundation and administration of\r\nthe same, sedition, confederacy with brigands, and other minor counts.\r\n\r\nIt was clear to every thinking man, American or European, that the\r\ncontrol of such a formidable body was a menace to peace. The accused\r\nwas brought to trial on the chief allegations, and in September,\r\n1903, he was sentenced to four years and two months' imprisonment,\r\nbut appealed against the sentence to the Supreme Court. Later\r\non he was tried on the other counts, and, although the public\r\nprosecution failed, it served the useful purpose of dissolving a\r\nleague the scope of which was shrouded in obscurity, at a period\r\nwhen the political atmosphere was still clouded by aspirations of\r\nimpossible and undesirable realization. I followed the course of\r\nthe trial daily, and I interviewed the accused at his house a week\r\nbefore it ended. Three hundred documents were read at the trial, and\r\n160 witnesses were brought against him. To endeavour to establish\r\na case of conspiracy against him, another individual was produced\r\nas his colleague. The first accused was defended by an American\r\nadvocate with such fervid eloquence, apparently inspired by earnest\r\nconviction of his client's innocence, that those who had to decide his\r\nfate acquitted him of the charge of conspiracy on May 11, 1904. The\r\ndefendant's verbal explanation to me of the \"Labour Union\" led me to\r\nthe conclusion that its abolition would benefit the community.\r\n\r\nThe abnormal rise in wages had the bad effect of inducing the\r\nnatives to leave their pastoral pursuits to flock into the towns. The\r\nlabour question is still a difficult problem, for it is the habit\r\nof the Filipino to discontinue work when he has a surplus in his\r\npocket. Private employers complain of scarcity and the unreliability\r\nof the unskilled labourer. Undoubtedly the majority of them would\r\nwelcome the return of Chinese coolies, whose entry into the Islands is\r\nprohibited by the Insular Government, in agreement with the desire of\r\nthe Filipinos, who know full well that the industrious Chinaman would\r\nlower wages and force the Filipinos into activity for an existence.\r\n\r\nConsul-General Wildman, of Hong-Kong, in his report for 1900 to the\r\nState Department, Washington, said: \"There has been, during the past\r\nyear, quite an investment of Hong-Kong capital in Manila; but it\r\nis the general opinion that _no investment in mines or agriculture_\r\nin the Islands _will be of any great value until the introduction of\r\nChinese labour_ is not only _permitted_ but _encouraged_.\"\r\n\r\nSection IV. of the Chinese Exclusion Act of 1902 provides that every\r\nChinese labourer rightfully in any insular territory of the United\r\nStates (Hawaii excepted), at the time of the passage of this Act,\r\nshall obtain, within one year thereafter, a certificate of residence,\r\nand upon failure to obtain such certificate he shall be deported;\r\nand the Philippine Commission is authorized and required to make all\r\nregulations necessary for the enforcement of this section in the\r\nPhilippine Islands. No restriction is placed upon their movement\r\nfrom one island to another of the Philippines, but they cannot go\r\nfrom the Philippines to America.\r\n\r\nThe regulations established by the Insular Government (Act of March\r\n27, 1903) in conformity with the above-cited Act are as follows: The\r\nChinese can leave the Islands and return thereto within a year. They\r\nmust obtain a certificate of departure and be photographed. To\r\nre-enter the Islands they must procure a certificate of departure at\r\nthe place of embarkation (usually China) for the Philippines. Thus,\r\nduring the year ending June 30, 1902, 10,158 Chinese entered Manila,\r\nand 11,432 left it with return certificates. Chinese resident in the\r\nIslands must be registered. The first banishment for contravention\r\nof this regulation took place on January 6, 1905.\r\n\r\nFor a long time there was a big contraband business done in Chinese. A\r\ncoolie would pay as much as 400 pesos premium to find himself where he\r\ncould earn up to 100 pesos per month. The contraband agent in China\r\nwas an ex-Custom-house officer. The Manila agent was in the Customs\r\nservice, and the colleagues on the China side were high officials. When\r\nthe conspiracy was discovered the agent in China came to Manila to\r\nanswer the charge, and was at once arrested. A prosecution was entered\r\nupon; but after a protracted trial, the proceedings were quashed,\r\nfor reasons which need not be discussed. The Exclusion Act is so\r\nrigidly upheld that in the case of a Chinese merchant who died in\r\nthe Islands leaving a fortune of about 200,000 pesos, his (Chinese)\r\nexecutor was refused permission to reside temporarily in the Colony\r\nfor the sole purpose of winding up the deceased's affairs.\r\n\r\nThe social position of the Chinese permitted to remain in the\r\nIslands has changed since the American advent. In former times, when\r\nthe highest authorities frowned upon the Chinese community, it was\r\nnecessary to propitiate them with bags of silver pesos. There was no\r\nChinese consul in those days; but Chino Carlos Palanca was practically\r\nthe protector and dictator of his countrymen during the last decade of\r\nSpanish rule, and, if a cloud descended upon them from high quarters,\r\nhe used to pass the word round for a dollar levy to dissipate it. In\r\nFebruary, 1900, Chino Palanca was made a mandarin of the first class,\r\nand when his spirit passed away to the abode of his ancestors his\r\nbody was followed to interment by an immense sympathetic crowd of\r\nCelestials. This pompous funeral was one of the great social events of\r\nthe year. Now there is a Chinese consul in Manila whose relations to\r\nhis people are very different from those between Europeans and their\r\nconsuls. The Chinese consul paternally tells his countrymen what they\r\nare to do, and they do it with filial submission. He has given them\r\nto understand that they occupy a higher position than that formerly\r\naccorded to the Chinese in this Colony (_vide_ Chinese, Chapter viii).\r\n\r\nOn my first visit to Manila alter the American occupation I was struck\r\nto see Chinese in the streets wearing the pigtail down their backs,\r\nand dressed in nicely-cut semi-European patrol-jacket costumes of cloth\r\nor washing-stuffs, with straw or felt \"trilby\" hats. Now, too, they\r\nmix freely among the whites in public places with an air of social\r\nequality, and occupy stall seats in the theatre, which they would\r\nnot have dared to enter in pre-American times. The Chinese Chamber\r\nof Commerce is also of recent foundation, and its status is so far\r\nrecognized by the Americans that it was invited to express an opinion\r\non the Internal Revenue Bill, already referred to, before it became\r\nlaw. The number of Chinese in the whole Archipelago is estimated\r\nat about 41,000. When an enterprising American introduced a large\r\nnumber of jinrikishas, intending to establish that well-known system\r\nof locomotion here, the Chinese Consulate very shortly put its veto\r\non the employment of Chinese runners. The few natives who ran them\r\nbecame objects of ridicule. The first person who used a jinrikisha in\r\nManila, with Chinese in livery, was a European consul. Other whites,\r\nunaccustomed to these vehicles, took to beating the runners--a thing\r\nnever seen or heard of in Japan or in colonies where they are used in\r\nthousands. The natural result was that the 'rikisha man bolted and the\r\n'rikisha tilted backwards, to the discomfort of the fool riding in\r\nit. The attempted innovation failed, and the vehicles were sent out\r\nof the Colony.\r\n\r\nApart from the labour question, if the Chinese were allowed a free\r\nentry they would perpetuate the smartest pure Oriental mixed class\r\nin the Islands. On the other hand, if their exclusion should remain\r\nin force beyond the present generation it will have a marked adverse\r\neffect on the activity of the people (_vide_ pp. 182, 411).\r\n\r\nAt the period of the American occupation the _Currency_ of the\r\nIslands was the Mexican and Spanish-Philippine peso, of a value\r\nconstantly fluctuating between 49 and 37 cents. gold (_vide_ table\r\nat p. 647). The shifty character of the silver basis created such an\r\nuncertainty in trade and investment transactions that the Government\r\nresolved to place the currency on a gold standard. Between January 1\r\nand October 5, 1902, the Insular Treasury lost $956,750.37 1/2 from the\r\nfall of silver. A difficulty to be confronted was the impossibility\r\nof ascertaining even the approximate total amount of silver current\r\nin the Islands. Opinions varied from P30,000,000 upwards. [297]\r\nPending the solution of the money problem, ineffectual attempts were\r\nmade to fix the relative values by the publication of an official\r\nratio between gold dollar and silver peso once a quarter; but as\r\nit never agreed with the commercial quotation many days running,\r\nthe announcement of the official ratio was altered to once in ten\r\ndays. Seeing that ten days or more elapsed before the current ratio\r\ncould be communicated to certain remote points, the complications in\r\nthe official accounts were most embarrassing. Congress Act of July\r\n1, 1902, authorized the coinage of subsidiary silver, but did not\r\ndetermine the unit of value or provide for the issue of either coin or\r\npaper money to take the place of the Mexican and Spanish-Philippine\r\npesos in circulation, so that it was quite inoperative. Finally,\r\nCongress Act of March 2, 1903, provided that the new standard should\r\nbe a peso equal in value to half a United States gold dollar. The\r\nmaximum amount authorized to be coined was 75,000,000 silver pesos,\r\neach containing 416 grains of silver, nine-tenths fine. The peso was\r\nto be legal tender for all debts, public and private, in the Islands,\r\nand was to be issued when the Insular Government should have 500,000\r\npesos ready for circulation. The peso is officially alluded to as\r\n\"Philippine currency,\" whilst the popular term, \"Conant,\" derives\r\nits name from a gentleman, Mr. Charles Conant, in whose report, dated\r\nNovember 25, 1901, this coin was suggested. He visited the Islands,\r\nimmortalized his name, and modestly retired.\r\n\r\nThe \"Philippine currency,\" or \"peso Conant,\" is guaranteed by the\r\nUnited States Treasury to be equal to 50 cents of a gold dollar. The\r\nsix subsidiary coins are 50, 20, and 10 cents silver, 5 cents nickel,\r\nand 1 and 1/2 cent bronze, equivalent to a sterling value of one\r\nshilling to one farthing. This new coinage, designed by a Filipino, was\r\nissued to the public at the end of July, 1903. The inaugurating issue\r\nconsisted of 17,881,650 silver pesos, in pesos and subsidiary coins,\r\nto be supplemented thereafter by the re-coinage of the Mexican and\r\nPhilippine pesos as they found their way into the Treasury. For public\r\nconvenience, silver certificates, or Treasury Notes, were issued,\r\nexchangeable for \"Conant\" silver pesos, to the extent of 6,000,000\r\npesos' worth in 10-peso notes; another 6,000,000 pesos in 5-peso notes,\r\nand 3,000,000 pesos in 2-peso notes, these last bearing a vignette\r\nof the Philippine patriot, the late Dr. Jose Rizal. On December 23,\r\n1903, the Governor reported that \"not till January 1, 1904, can the\r\nMexican coin be demonetized and denied as legal tender value.\" A\r\nproclamation, dated January 28, 1904, was issued by the Insular\r\nTreasury in Spanish and Tagalog to the effect (1) that after October 1,\r\n1904, the Government would only accept Mexican or Philippine pesos at\r\nthe value of their silver contents, and (2) that after December 31,\r\n1904, a tax would be levied on all deposits made at the banks of the\r\nabove-mentioned coinage. Notwithstanding the publication of numerous\r\nofficial circulars urging the use of the new peso, the Mexican and\r\nSpanish-Philippine dollars remained in free circulation during the\r\nfirst six months of 1904, although rent and certain other payments\r\nwere reckoned in \"Conant\" and current accounts at banks were kept in\r\nthe new currency, unless otherwise agreed. Naturally, as long as the\r\nseller was willing to accept Mexican for his goods, the buyer was only\r\ntoo pleased to pay in that medium, because if, for instance, he had to\r\npay 10 Mexican dollars, and only had \"Conant\" in his pocket, he could\r\ncall at any of the hundred exchange shops about town, change his 10\r\n\"Conant\" into Mexican at a 5 to 20 per cent. premium, settle his bill,\r\nand reserve the premium. Almost any Far Eastern fractional coins served\r\nas subsidiary coins to the Mexican or Spanish-Philippine peso, and\r\nduring nine or ten months there were no less than three currencies\r\nin use--namely, United States, Mexican (with Spanish-Philippine),\r\nand \"Conant.\" It was not practicable to deny a legal-tender value\r\nto so much Mexican, and Spanish-Philippine coin in circulation. The\r\nretailer was required to exhibit in his shop a card, supplied by the\r\nmunicipality, indicating the exchange-rate of the day, and declaring in\r\nSpanish, English, and Tagalog as follows: \"Our prices are in American\r\ncurrency. We accept Philippine currency at the rate of...\"; but the\r\nreckoning in small-value transactions was so bewildering that, in\r\npractice, he would accept any coinage the purchaser chose to give him\r\nat face value. From August 1, 1904, when the \"Internal Revenue Law\"\r\n(_vide_ p. 630) came into operation, merchants' and bankers' accounts\r\nand all large transactions were settled on the new-currency basis. Many\r\nretailers followed the lead, and the acceptance of the new medium\r\nthenceforth greatly increased. Still, for several months, provincial\r\nnatives were loth to part with their old coin at a discount, or, as\r\nthey plainly put it, lose 10 to 20 per cent. of their cash capital\r\nat a stroke. The Insular Treasurer therefore issued another circular\r\nin December, 1904, stating that whosoever engaged in business should\r\nmake use of the old coinage in trade transactions after December 31,\r\n1904, without special licence, would be condemned to pay not only\r\nthat licence, but a heavy fine, or be _sent to prison_; and that\r\nall written agreements made after October, 1904, involving a payment\r\nin old currency, would pay a tax of 1 per cent. per month from the\r\nsaid date of December, 1904. Nevertheless, further pressure had to be\r\nexercised by the Civil Governor, who, in a circular dated January 7,\r\n1905, stated that \"it is hereby ordered that the Insular Treasurer\r\nand all provincial treasurers in the Philippine Islands shall, on and\r\nafter this date and until February 1, 1905, purchase Spanish-Filipino\r\ncurrency, Mexican currency, Chinese subsidiary silver coins, and all\r\nforeign copper coins now circulating in the Philippine Islands at\r\n_one peso_, Philippine currency, for _one peso and twenty centavos_,\r\nlocal currency.\"\r\n\r\nAs late as March, 1905, there was still a considerable amount of old\r\ncoinage in private hands, but practically the new medium was definitely\r\nestablished. The total number of \"Conant\" pesos in circulation in\r\nthe Islands, in the middle of May, 1905, was 29,715,720 (all minted\r\nin America), and \"Conant\" paper, P10,150,000.\r\n\r\nFrom the time of the American occupation up to May, 1902, the two\r\nforeign banks--the Hong-Kong and Shanghai Banking Corporation and\r\nthe Chartered Bank of India, Australia, and China (_vide_ Banks,\r\np. 258)--were the only depositaries for the Insular Treasury, outside\r\nthe Treasury itself. In the meantime, two important American banks\r\nestablished themselves in the Islands--namely, the \"Guaranty Trust\r\nCompany,\" and the \"International Banking Corporation.\" On May 15,\r\n1902, the \"Guaranty Trust Company\" was appointed a depositary for\r\nPhilippine funds both in Manila and in the United States; and on June\r\n21 following the \"International Banking Corporation\" was likewise\r\nappointed a depositary for the Insular Treasury, each being under a\r\nbond of $2,000,000. These two banks also act as fiscal agents to the\r\nUnited States in the Philippines. [298]\r\n\r\nIn 1904 the position of the \"Banco Espanol-Filipino\" (_vide_ p. 258)\r\nwas officially discussed. This bank, the oldest established in Manila,\r\nholds a charter from the Spanish Government, the validity of which was\r\nrecognized. The Insular Government sought to reduce the amount of its\r\npaper currency, which was alleged to be three times the amount of its\r\ncash capital. Meanwhile, the notes in circulation, representing the\r\nold Philippine medium, ceased to be legal tender, and were exchanged\r\nfor \"Conant\" peso-value notes at the current rate of exchange.\r\n\r\nFor a short period there existed an establishment entitled the\r\n\"American Bank,\" which did not prosper and was placed in liquidation\r\non May 18, 1905, by order of the Gov.-General, pursuant to Philippine\r\nCommission Act No. 52 as amended by Act No. 556.\r\n\r\nIn February, 1909, the terms of Article 4 of the Treaty of Paris\r\n(_vide_ p. 479) will lapse, leaving America a freer hand to determine\r\nthe commercial future of the Philippines. It remains to be seen\r\nwhether the \"Philippines for the Filipinos\" policy, promoted by the\r\nfirst Civil Governor, or the \"Equal opportunities for all\" doctrine,\r\npropounded by the first Gov.-General, will be the one then adopted\r\nby America. Present indications point to the former merging into the\r\nlatter, almost of necessity, if it is desired to encourage American\r\ncapitalists to invest in the Islands. The advocate of the former\r\npolicy is the present responsible minister for Philippine affairs,\r\nwhilst, on this work going to press, the propounder of the latter\r\ndoctrine has been justly rewarded, for his honest efforts to govern\r\nwell, with the appointment of first American Ambassador to Japan.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTrade Statistics\r\n\r\n\r\nTotal Import and Export Values (exclusive of Silver and Gold)\r\n\r\n\r\nPeriod.

For this\r\nimplied monastic indiscriminate acquisition of real estate several\r\nof the best native families (some of them personally known to me)\r\nwere banished to the Island of Mindoro.\r\n\r\n[5] According to the Spanish Hydrographic Map, it is 8,813 feet:\r\nthe Pajal and Montano Expedition (1880) made it 10,270 feet; the\r\nSchadenberg and Koch Expedition (1882) computed it at 10,827 feet.\r\n\r\n[6] _Vide_ pamphlet published immediately after the event by Father\r\nFrancisco Aragoneses, P.P. of Cagsaua, begging alms for the victims.\r\n\r\n[7] \"Hist. de la Prov. de Batangas,\" por D.

First\r\npart published in Madrid, 1698, the second part yet inedited and\r\npreserved in the archives of the Corporation of Saint Augustine\r\nin Manila.\r\n\r\n[12] P.P. of Taal from 1572 to 1575.\r\n\r\n[13] In the same archives of the Saint Augustine Corporation in Manila\r\nan eruption in 1641 is recorded.\r\n\r\n[14] During the previous century jealousy had run so high between\r\nSpain and Portugal with regard to their respective colonization and\r\ntrading rights, that the question of demarcation had to be settled by\r\nthe Pope Alexander VI., who issued a bull dated May 4, 1493, dividing\r\nthe world into two hemispheres, and decreeing that all heathen lands\r\ndiscovered in the Western half, from the meridian 100 leagues W. of\r\nCape Verd Island, should belong to the Spaniards; in the Eastern half\r\nto the Portuguese. The bull was adopted by both nations in the Treaty\r\nof Tordesillas (June 7, 1494). It gave rise to many passionate debates,\r\nas the Spaniards wrongly insisted that the Philippines and the Moluccas\r\ncame within the division allotted to them by Pontifical donation.\r\n\r\n[15] Probably so called from the enormous number of _patos_ (ducks)\r\nfound there.\r\n\r\n[16] The Visayos, inhabiting the central group of the Archipelago,\r\ntattooed themselves; a cutaneous disease also disfigured the majority;\r\nhence for many years their islands were called by the Spaniards _Islas\r\nde los pintados_.\r\n\r\n[17] Legaspi and Guido Lavezares, under oath, made promises of rewards\r\nto the Lacandola family and a remission of tribute in perpetuity,\r\nbut they were not fulfilled. In the following century--year 1660--it\r\nappears that the descendants of the Rajah Lacandola still upheld the\r\nSpanish authority, and having become sorely impoverished thereby,\r\nthe heir of the family petitioned the Governor (Sabiniano Manrique de\r\nLara) to make good the honour of his first predecessors. Eventually\r\nthe Lacandolas were exempted from the payment of tribute and poll-tax\r\nfor ever, as recompense for the filching of their domains.\r\n\r\nIn 1884, when the fiscal reforms were introduced which abolished the\r\ntribute and established in lieu thereof a document of personal identity\r\n(_cedula personal_), for which a tax was levied, the last vestige of\r\nprivilege disappeared.\r\n\r\nDescendants of Lacandola are still to be met with in several villages\r\nnear Manila. They do not seem to have materially profited by their\r\ntranscendent ancestry--one of them I found serving as a waiter in a\r\nFrench restaurant in the capital in 1885.\r\n\r\n[18] _Velas_, Spanish for sails.\r\n\r\n[19] _Ladrones_, Spanish for thieves.\r\n\r\n[20] Mr. Doane is reported to have died in Honolulu about June, 1890\r\n\r\n[21] Guido de Lavezares deposed a Sultan in Borneo in order to\r\naid another to the throne, and even asked permission of King Philip\r\nII. to conquer China, which of course was not conceded to him. _Vide_\r\nalso the history of the destruction of the Aztec (Mexican) and Incas\r\n(Peruvian) dynasties by the Spaniards, in W. H. Prescott's \"Conquest\r\nof Mexico\" and \"Conquest of Peru.\"\r\n\r\n[22] _Maestre de Campo_ (obsolete grade) about equivalent to the modern\r\nGeneral of Brigade. This officer was practically the military governor.\r\n\r\n[23] According to Juan de la Concepcion, in his \"Hist. Gen. de\r\nPhilipinas,\" Vol. I., p. 431, Li-ma-hong made his escape by cutting\r\na canal for his ships to pass through, but this would appear to be\r\nhighly improbable under the circumstances.\r\n\r\n[24] Some authors assert that only Soliman rebelled.\r\n\r\n[25] Domingo Salazar, the first Bishop of Manila, took possession in\r\n1581. He and one companion were the only Dominicans in the Islands\r\nuntil 1587.\r\n\r\n[26] Bondage in the Philippines was apparently not so necessary for\r\nthe interests of the Church as it was in Cuba, where a commission of\r\nfriars, appointed soon after the discovery of the Island, to deliberate\r\non the policy of partially permitting slavery there, reported \"that\r\nthe Indians would not labour without compulsion and that, unless they\r\nlaboured, they could not be brought into communication with the whites,\r\nnor be converted to Christianity.\" _Vide_ W.

Between 1606 and 1608, owing to a rising\r\nof the Japanese settlers, their dwellings in Dilao were sacked and\r\nthe settlement burnt.\r\n\r\n[30] Portugal was forcibly annexed to the Spanish Crown from 1581\r\nto 1640.\r\n\r\n[31] Philip II.'s persecution of religious apostates during the\r\n\"Wars of the Flanders\" was due as much to the fact that Protestantism\r\nwas becoming a political force, threatening Spain's dominion, as to\r\nCatholic sentiment.\r\n\r\n[32] Religious intolerance in Spain was confirmed in 1822 by the New\r\nPenal Code of that date; the text reads thus: \"Todo el que conspirase\r\ndirectamente y de hecho a establecer otra religion en las Espanas, o a\r\nque la Nacion Espanola deje de profesar la religion Apostolica Romana\r\nes traidor y sufrira la pena de muerte.\" Articulo 227 del Codigo Penal\r\npresentado a las Cortes en 22 de Abril de 1821 y sancionado en 1822.\"\r\n\r\n[33] \"Hist.

It was afterwards subsidized by the\r\nGovernment, and was under the care of the Franciscan friars up to\r\nthe close of the Spanish dominion.\r\n\r\n[35] From this date the Molucca Islands were definitely evacuated and\r\nabandoned by the Spaniards, although as many men and as much material\r\nand money had been employed in garrisons and conveyance of subsidies\r\nthere as in the whole Philippine Colony up to that period.\r\n\r\n[36] \"Hist.

During the Union\r\nof Spain and Portugal (1581-1640), the Dutch made two unsuccessful\r\nattempts to seize it (1622 and 1627). This colony was the great\r\nEuropean-Chinese emporium prior to Hong-Kong (1841), and paid crown\r\nrent to China up to 1848.\r\n\r\n[38] Zuniga's History, Vol II., Chap xii., English translation,\r\npublished in London, 1814.\r\n\r\n[39] Cronica de los P. P. Dominicos, Vol. IV., pp. 637 to 650,\r\nedition of Rivadenayra, published in Madrid.\r\n\r\n[40] This money constituted the Manila merchants' specie remittances\r\nfrom Acapulco, together with the Mexican subsidy to support the\r\nadministration of this Colony, which was merely a dependency of Mexico\r\nup to the second decade of last century (_vide_ Chap. xv.).\r\n\r\n[41] Vicissitudes of Sultan Mahamad Alimudin (_vide_ Chap. x.).\r\n\r\n[42] So tenacious was the opposition of the Austin friars, both in\r\nManila and the provinces, that the British appear to have regarded\r\nthem as their special foes.\r\n\r\nFrom the archives of Bauan Convent, Province of Batangas, I have taken\r\nthe following notes, viz.:--The Austin friars lost P 238,000 and 15\r\nconvents. Six of their estates were despoiled. The troops killed were\r\n300 Spaniards, 500 Pampanga natives, and 300 Tagalog natives. Besides\r\nthe Austin friars from the galleon _Trinidad_, who were made prisoners\r\nand shipped to Bombay, 10 of their Order were killed in battle and\r\n19 were captured and exiled to India and Europe.\r\n\r\n[43] The prominent men in this movement were the brothers Palmero,\r\nmaternal uncles of the well-known Spanish soldier-politician, General\r\nMarcelo Azcarraga.\r\n\r\nBorn in 1832 in Manila, General Marcelo Azcarraga was the son of\r\nJose Azcarraga, a Biscayan Spaniard, and his creole wife Dr. Maria\r\nPalmero. Jose Azcarraga was a bookseller, established in the\r\n_Escolta_ (Binondo), in a building (burnt down in October, 1885) on\r\nthe site where stood the General Post Office up to June, 1904. In\r\nthe fire of 1885 the first MS. of the first edition of this work\r\nwas consumed, and had to be re-written. Jose Azcarraga had several\r\nsons and daughters. His second son, Marcelo, first studied law at\r\nSt. Thomas' University, and then entered the Nautical School, where\r\nhe gained the first prize in mathematics. Sent to Spain to continue\r\nhis studies, he entered the Military School, and in three years' time\r\nobtained the rank of Captain. For his services against the O'Donnell\r\nrevolutionary movement (1854) in Madrid, he was promoted to Major. At\r\nthe age of twenty-three he obtained the Cross of San Fernando (with\r\npension). Having served Spain with distinction in several important\r\nmissions to Mexico, Cuba, and Sto. Domingo, he returned to Cuba and\r\nespoused the daughter of the great banker, Fesser, who gave him a\r\nfortune of L20,000 on the day of his marriage. In the year of Isabella\r\nII.'s deposition (1868) he returned to Spain, promoted the Bourbon\r\nrestoration, and became Lieut.-General on the proclamation of Alfonso\r\nXII. (1875). He then became successively M.P., Senator by election,\r\nand life Senator. He was Minister of War under Canovas del Castillo,\r\non whose assassination (Aug. 8, 1897) he became Prime Minister of\r\nthe Interim Government specially charged to keep order until after\r\nthe unpopular marriage of the Princess of Asturias. After several\r\nMinisterial changes he again took the leadership of the Government,\r\nwas lately President of the Senate, and on his retirement, at the age\r\nof seventy-two, he received the _Toison de Oro_ (Golden Fleece)--the\r\nmost elevated Order in Spain. On his mother's side he descends from the\r\nPhilippine creole family of the Conde de Lizarraga, and is uncle to the\r\nConde de Albay, better known in Philippine society as Senor Govantes.\r\n\r\n[44] It was practically a secret branch of the _Junta General de\r\nReformas_ authorized to discuss reforms, and created by the Colonial\r\nMinister Becerra during the governor-generalship of General La Torre\r\nin the time of the Provisional Government in Spain which succeeded\r\nthe deposed Queen Isabella II.\r\n\r\n[45] He was the grandfather of one of the most conspicuous surviving\r\ngenerals of the Tagalog Rebellion (1896) and the War of Independence\r\n(1899).\r\n\r\n[46] Jose Maria Basa was the son of Matias Basa, a builder and\r\ncontractor by trade, who made a contract with the Spanish Government\r\nto fill up the stream which branched from the Pasig River and crossed\r\nthe _Escolta_ (Manila), where now stands the street called _Calle\r\nde San Jacinto_. In consideration of this work he was permitted to\r\nbuild houses on the reclaimed land, provided he made a thoroughfare\r\nwhere the former bed of the rivulet existed. This undertaking made\r\nhis fortune. His son, Jose Maria, had several trading schemes,\r\nthe most prosperous of which was his distillery at Trozo (Manila),\r\nwhich brought him large profits, and was a flourishing concern\r\nin 1872. On being amnestied, he established himself in Hong-Kong,\r\nwhere he is still living with his family in easy circumstances and\r\nhighly respected. His unbounded hospitality to all who know him, and\r\nespecially to his countrymen, has justly earned for him in Hong-Kong\r\nthe title of the \"Father of the Filipinos.\"\r\n\r\nDr. Antonio Maria Regidor y Jurado, a young lawyer, was arrested\r\nand banished to the Ladrone Islands, whence he afterwards escaped to\r\nHong-Kong in a foreign vessel, disguised as a priest. From that Colony\r\nhe found his way to France, where he intended to settle, but eventually\r\nestablished himself in London, where he still holds a high position\r\nas a Spanish consulting lawyer. By his marriage with an Irish lady,\r\nhe has a son and several charming daughters, his well-appointed home\r\nbeing the rendezvous of all the best class of Filipinos who visit\r\nthe British metropolis.\r\n\r\n[47] \"Hist. Gen. de Philipinas,\" by Juan de la Concepcion, Vol. IV.,\r\np. 53. Published in Manila, 1788.\r\n\r\n[48] Ibid., Vol. V., p. 429.\r\n\r\n[49] About two per thousand of the resident Chinese were _not_\r\noriginally coolies.\r\n\r\n[50] General Wong Yung Ho, accompanied by a Chinese Justice of the\r\nHigh Court, visited Australia in the middle of the year 1887. In a\r\nnewspaper of that Colony, it was reported that after these persons\r\nhad been courteously entertained and shown the local institutions and\r\nindustries, they had the effrontery to protest against the State Laws,\r\nand asked for a repeal of the \"poll tax\"--considered there the only\r\ncheck upon a Chinese coolie inundation!\r\n\r\n[51] Just before the naval engagement of Playa Honda between Dutch\r\nand Spanish ships (_vide_ p. 75) the Dutch intercepted Chinese junks\r\non the way to Manila, bringing, amongst their cargoes of food, as\r\nmany as 12,000 capons.\r\n\r\n[52] Since about the year 1885, this system, which entailed severe\r\nlosses, gradually fell into disuse, and business on _cash terms_\r\nbecame more general.\r\n\r\n[53] In old writings, laws, and documents, and in ordinary parlance up\r\nto the evacuation by the Spaniards in 1898, the inhabitants of these\r\nIslands (civilized or uncivilized) were almost invariably referred\r\nto as _Indios, Indigenas, Naturales, Mestizos, Espanoles-Filipinos_,\r\netc., the term \"Filipino\" being seldom used. The Revolution of 1896\r\ngeneralized the appellation \"Filipino\" now in common use.\r\n\r\nThroughout this work, \"Filipino\" is taken as the substantive and\r\n\"Philippine\" as the adjective, that being the correct English form.\r\n\r\nThe Americans, however, use \"Filipino\" both substantively and\r\nadjectivally.\r\n\r\n[54] For an exhaustive treatise on this subject the\r\nreader is recommended to peruse A. R. Wallace's \"The Malay\r\nArchipelago.\" Published in London, 1869.\r\n\r\n[55] The _Ibanacs_ are the ordinary domesticated natives inhabiting\r\nthe extreme north of Luzon and the banks of the Rio Grande de Cagayan\r\nfor some miles up. Some of them have almost black skins. I found them\r\nvery manageable.\r\n\r\n[56] According to Father Pedro Murillo, the ancient name of Basilan\r\nwas Taguima, so called from a river there of that name.\r\n\r\n[57] Mahometanism appears to have been introduced into the Islands\r\nof Borneo and Mindanao by Arabian missionary prophets.\r\n\r\n[58] It was called the _Fuerza del Pilar_, and is now the American\r\nMoro Province military headquarters and head quartermaster's office\r\nand depot. The image of Our Lady in a niche in the north wall is much\r\nrevered by Catholics.\r\n\r\n[59] _Paseo de los gigantes_, the custom still existing in Spain of\r\nintroducing giant figures into popular festivities, reminding one of\r\nGuy Fawkes.\r\n\r\n[60] The Sultan complained that he had not been treated in Manila\r\nwith dignity equal to his rank and quality, and that he had constantly\r\nbeen under guard of soldiers in his residence (this was explained to\r\nbe a guard-of-honour).\r\n\r\n[61] Cholera has considerably reduced the population. In 1902 this\r\ndisease carried off about 10 per cent.\r\n\r\n[62] Brunei signifies, in pure Malay, the _whole_ of Borneo Island.\r\n\r\n[63] The Sultan told me years afterwards that his uncle's nomination by\r\nthe Spaniards troubled him very little, as he was always recognized\r\nby his people as their sovereign. In the end intrigues were made\r\nagainst Datto Harun Narrasid, who agreed to accept his nephew's vassal\r\nsultanate of Paragua, where he died, and was succeeded by his son,\r\nSultan Tattarassa, whom I met in Jolo in 1904.\r\n\r\n[64] Cottabato is derived from _Cotta_, a fort, and _Bato_, stone.\r\n\r\n[65] By Royal Order of June, 1890, Brig.-General Arolas was appointed\r\nGovernor of Mindanao. He died in Valencia (Spain) May, 1899.\r\n\r\n[66] According to Sonnerat, Sulu Island produced elephants!--_vide_\r\n\"Voyages aux Indes et a la Chine,\" Vol. III., Chap. x. I have not\r\nseen the above statement confirmed in any writing. Certainly there\r\nis no such animal in these islands at the present day.\r\n\r\n[67] This building was destroyed by Colonel Arolas, April 15, 1887\r\n(_vide_ p. 144).\r\n\r\n[68] A few outposts had recently been established by Royal Decree. They\r\nwere all under the command of a captain, _vide_ Chap. xiii.\r\n\r\n[69] There is another tribe in Palauan Island called _Batacs_,\r\nwith Papuan noses, curly hair, and very dark skin. Their origin is\r\na mystery.\r\n\r\n[70] Alfred Marche calls this the _Tragulus ranchil_, and says it is\r\nalso to be found in Malacca, Cochin China, and Pulo Condor (_vide_\r\n\"Lucon et Palaouan,\" par A. Marche. Paris, 1887).\r\n\r\n[71] By Royal Order of August 20, 1888, a concession of 12,000\r\nto 14,000 hectares of land in Palauan was granted to Felipe\r\nCanga-Argueelles y Villalba, ex-Governor of Puerta Princesa, for the\r\nterm of 20 years.\r\n\r\nHe could work mines, cut timber, and till the land so conceded under\r\nthe law called \"Ley de Colonias Agricolas,\" of September 4, 1884,\r\nwhich was little more than an extension to the Philippines of the\r\nPeninsula forest and agricultural law of June 3, 1868 (_vide Gaceta de\r\nMadrid_ of September 29, 1888). It appears, however, from the Colonial\r\nMinister's despatch No. 515, to the Gov.-General of the Colony, dated\r\nMay 24, 1890, that the concessionaire had endeavoured to associate\r\nhimself with foreigners for the working of the concession. I myself had\r\nreceived from him several letters on the subject. The wording of the\r\ndespatch shows that suspicion was entertained of an eventual intention\r\nto declare territorial independence in Palauan. The Government,\r\nwishing to avoid the possibility of embroilment with a foreign nation,\r\nunfortunately felt constrained to impose such restrictions upon the\r\nconcessionaire as to render his enterprise valueless.\r\n\r\n[72] We have several modern instances of similar volcanic disturbances\r\ncreating and demolishing land surface, on an infinitely lesser\r\nscale--e.g., the disappearance of Krakatoa and the entire town and\r\nbusy port of Anger in 1883; the eruption which swallowed up the whole\r\ninhabited Japanese island Torii Shima; the appearance of an entirely\r\nnew island, Nii Shima (about lat. 25 deg. N.), within the past twelve\r\nmonths; and, within the historical period, the apparition of the\r\nKurile Islands.\r\n\r\n[73] _Vide_ Chap. v. By way of retaliation for the expulsion of Spanish\r\nmissionaries from Japan in the l7th century, all the male Japanese\r\nabove ten years of age were ordered to leave their settlements up the\r\nLake. Under this order over 20,000 of them were expelled from the\r\nColony. There was a Japanese temple existing (though not in use as\r\nsuch) in the suburbs of Manila up to last century, when Gov.-General\r\nNorzagaray (1857-60) had it destroyed.\r\n\r\n[74] The Spaniards must have been quite cognisant of these rites,\r\nseeing that the Moorish invasion of Spain lasted nearly eight\r\ncenturies, namely from the year 711 up to 1492--only a couple of\r\ndecades before Legaspi's generation.\r\n\r\n[75] Based on this tradition, Don Jose Carvajal has written a very\r\ninteresting play entitled _Ligaya_. It was produced at the National\r\nTheatre, Manila, in 1904.\r\n\r\n[76] Possibly the people of Tondo (Manila) learnt from the Chinese\r\nthe art of preparing that canine delicacy called _Cubang-aso_.\r\n\r\n[77] Consequent on the American advent, wages steadily rose\r\nproportionately to the increased cost of everything. But when,\r\nlater on, wages far exceeded the native's needs, he demanded more\r\nand actually went on strike to obtain it!\r\n\r\n[78] With regard to this characteristic among the Chinese, Sir John\r\nBowring (late Governor of Hong-Kong) affirms that the Chinese respect\r\ntheir writings and traditions, whilst they do not believe a lie to\r\nbe a fault, and in some of their classical works it is especially\r\nrecommended, in order to cheat and confuse foreign intruders (_vide_\r\n\"A Visit to the Philippine Islands,\" by Sir John Bowring, LL.D.,\r\nF.R.S. Manila, 1876 Spanish edition, p. 176).\r\n\r\n[79] See the Army Regulations for the advantages granted to military\r\nmen who married Philippine-born women (_vide_also p. 53).\r\n\r\n[80] _Catapusan_ signifies in native dialect the gathering of friends,\r\nwhich terminates the festival connected with any event or ceremony,\r\nwhether it be a wedding, a funeral, a baptism, or an election of\r\nlocal authorities, etc. The festivities after a burial last nine\r\ndays, and on the last day of wailing, drinking, praying, and eating,\r\nthe meeting is called the _Catapusan_.\r\n\r\n[81] \"Historia de Nuestra Senora La Virgen de Antipolo,\" by\r\nM. Romero. Published in Manila, 1886.\r\n\r\n[82] He became a prelate twenty-one years afterwards, having been\r\nordained Bishop of Nueva Segovia in 1671.\r\n\r\n[83] A decree issued by Don Juan de Ozaeta, a magistrate of the Supreme\r\nCourt, in his general visit of inspection to the provinces, dated May\r\n26, 1696, enacts the following, viz.:--\"That Chinese half-castes and\r\nheadmen shall be compelled to go to church and attend Divine Service,\r\nand act according to the customs established in the villages.\" The\r\npenalty for an infraction of this mandate by a male was \"20 lashes in\r\nthe public highway and two months' labour in the Royal Rope Walk (in\r\nTaal), or in the Galleys of Cavite.\" If the delinquent was a female,\r\nthe chastisement was \"one month of public penance in the church.\" The\r\n_Alcalde_ or Governor of the Province who did not promptly inflict\r\nthe punishment was to be mulcted in the sum of \"P200, to be paid to\r\nthe Royal Treasury.\"\r\n\r\n[84] _Diario de Manila_, Saturday, July 28, 1888.\r\n\r\n[85] _Vide p._ 54. According to Concepcion, there were headmen at the\r\ntime of the Conquest who had as many as 300 slaves, and as a property\r\nthey ranked next in value to gold (_vide_ \"Hist. Gen. de Philipinas,\"\r\nby Juan de la Concepcion, published in Manila in 1788, in 14 volumes).\r\n\r\n[86] _Vide_ \"Recopilacion de las Leyes de Indias,\" Ley V. xiii.,\r\nlib. i.\r\n\r\n[87] Referring to Leprosy, the _Charity Record_, London, December\r\n15, 1898, says:--\"Reliable estimates place the number of lepers in\r\nIndia, China, and Japan at 1,000,000. About 500,000 probably would\r\nbe a correct estimate for India only, although the official number\r\nis less, owing to the many who from being hidden, or homeless, or\r\nfrom other causes, escape enumeration.\"\r\n\r\n[88] Navarrete's \"Coleccion de los Viajes y Descubrimientos,\" tom. II.,\r\nNos. 12, 18. Madrid, 1825.\r\n\r\n[89] In the turbulent ages, centuries ago, it was not an uncommon\r\nthing for a prince or nobleman to secure his domain against seizure\r\nor conquest by transferring it nominally to the Pope, from whom he\r\nthenceforth held it as a papal fief.\r\n\r\n[90] Under the Spanish Government, the See of Manila comprised the\r\nprovinces of Bulacan, Pampanga, Zambales, Cavite, La Laguna, Bataan,\r\nIsland of Mindoro, and part of Tarlac. The other part of Tarlac was in\r\nthe See of Nueva Segovia, which had (in 1896) ecclesiastical control\r\nover 997,629 Christians and 172,383 pagans. The See of Jaro is the\r\none most recently created (1867).\r\n\r\n[91] The Royal Decree setting forth the execution of this Brief was\r\nprinted in Madrid in 1773. This politic-religious Order was banished\r\nfrom Portugal and Spain in 1767. In Madrid, on the night of March 31,\r\nthe Royal Edict was read to the members of the Company of Jesus, who\r\nwere allowed time to pack up their most necessary chattels and leave\r\nfor the coast, where they were hurriedly embarked for Rome. The same\r\nOrder was suppressed for ever in France in 1764.\r\n\r\n[92] At the date of the Tagalog Rebellion (1896) the Jesuits in the\r\nIslands were as follows: In Manila, 24 priests, 25 lay brothers, and\r\n13 teachers; in Mindanao, 62 priests and 43 lay brothers, making a\r\ntotal of 167 individuals. They were not allowed to possess real estate.\r\n\r\n[93] _Vide_ \"Catalogo de los Religiosos de N.S.P. San\r\nAgustin.\" Published in Manila, 1864.\r\n\r\n[94] The Augustinian Order was founded in the 4th century; the\r\nFranciscan in 1210 and confirmed by Papal Bull in 1223; the Dominican\r\nin 1261; the Recoleto in 1602; the Benedictine in 530; the Capuchin\r\nin 1209 and the Paulist in 1625.\r\n\r\n[95] For any further expense this might incur, 3 per cent, was deducted\r\nfrom the parish priests' emoluments.\r\n\r\n[96] \"Recopilacion de las Leyes de Indias.\"--Ley 46, tit. 14, lib. 1 deg.,\r\nforbids priests and members of any religious body to take part in\r\nmatters of Civil Government.\r\n\r\n[97] In the early days of Mexican conquest, the conquered land was\r\napportioned to the warriors under the name of _Repartimentos_, but\r\nsuch divisions included the absolute possession of the natives as\r\nslaves (_vide_ \"La vida y escritos del P. Fray Bartolome de las Casas,\r\nObispo de Chiapa,\" by Antonio Maria Fabie, Colonial Minister in the\r\nCanovas Cabinet of 1890 Madrid).\r\n\r\n[98] Juan Salcedo, Legaspi's grandson (_vide_ Chaps. ii. and iv.) was\r\nrewarded with several _Encomiendas_ in the Ilocos provinces, on the\r\nwest coast of Luzon, where he levied a tribute on the natives whom\r\nhe subdued.\r\n\r\n[99] Changed afterwards to Manila Province; now called Rizal Province\r\n(Morong district incorporated therein) since the American occupation.\r\n\r\n[100] \"Noticias de Filipinas,\" by Don Eusebio Mazorca. Inedited\r\nMS. dated 1840, in the Archives of Bauan Convent, Province of Batangas.\r\n\r\n[101] The text reads thus:--\"Para ser jefe de Provincia en estas Islas\r\nno se requiere carrera, conocimientos ni servicios determinados, todos\r\nson aptos y admisibles.... Es cosa bastante comun ver a un peluquero\r\no lacayo de un gobernador, a un marinero y a un desertor transformado\r\nde repente en Alcalde-Mayor, sub-delegado y Capitan a guerra de una\r\nprovincia populosa, sin otro consejero que su rudo entendimiento,\r\nni mas guia que sus pasiones.\" Tomas de Comyn was an employee of\r\nthe \"_Real Compania de Filipinas_\" (q.v.), and subsequently Spanish\r\nConsul-General in Lisbon.\r\n\r\n[102] Transferred to Bais in January, 1889, in consequence of the\r\nrise of brigandage in the S.E. of Negros Island.\r\n\r\nThe brigands, under the leadership of a native named Camartin and\r\nanother, who declared themselves prophets, plundered the planters\r\nalong that coast, and committed such notorious crimes that troops had\r\nto be despatched there under the command of the famous Lieut.-Colonel\r\nVilla-Abrille. The Gov.-General Valeriano Weyler went to the Visayas\r\nIslands and personally directed the operations.\r\n\r\n[103] From January 1, 1889, the Government Financial year was made\r\nconcurrent with the year of the Calendar.\r\n\r\n[104] The text reads thus:--\"Cada Jefe de Provincia es un verdadero\r\nSultan y cuando acaba su administracion solo se habla en la Capital\r\nde los miles de pesos que saco _limpios_ de su alcaldia.\"--\"Noticias\r\nde Filipinas,\" by Don Eusebio Mazorca.

Officers from Captain (inclusive) upwards \"In expectation\r\nof Service\" and \"In excess of Active Service requirements,\" received\r\nonly four-fifths of ordinary pay.\r\n\r\n[109] In 1888 the \"King's Regiment\" was divided into two regiments,\r\nunder new denominations, viz.:--\"Castillo, No. 1\" (April 3), and\r\n\"Espana, No. 1\" (June 18).\r\n\r\n[110] This gentleman is at present residing in the county of Essex,\r\nEngland.\r\n\r\n[111] Under British law, a litigant is not allowed to bring and\r\nconduct an action _in forma pauperis_ until it is proved that he is\r\nnot worth L5 after his debts are paid; and, moreover, he must obtain\r\na certificate from a barrister that he has _good cause of action_.\r\n\r\n[112] According to Zuniga (\"Hist. de Philipinas\"), the ancient\r\ninhabitants of Luzon Island had a kind of shell-money--the _Siguey_\r\nshell. _Siguey_ shells are so plentiful at the present day that they\r\nare used by children to play at _Sunca_.\r\n\r\n[113] _Situado_ is not literally \"Subsidy,\" but it was tantamount\r\nto that.\r\n\r\n[114] The values of shipments by law established were little regarded.\r\n\r\n[115] The _Obras Pias_ (i.e., Pious Works) funds were legacies\r\nleft exclusively by Spaniards, chiefly pious persons, for separate\r\nbeneficent objects. Two-thirds of the capital were to be lent at\r\ninterest, to stimulate trade abroad, and one-third was to be a reserve\r\nagainst possible losses. When the accumulated interest on the original\r\ncapital had reached a certain amount, it was to be applied to the\r\npayment of masses for the repose of the donors' souls.\r\n\r\nThe peculations of the Gov.-General Pedro Manuel de Arandia (1754-59)\r\npermitted him to amass a fortune of a quarter of a million pesos in\r\nless than five years' service, which sum he left to pious works. On the\r\nsecession of Mexico (in 1819) the Government took over the _Obras Pias_\r\nfunds, to control their administration. There is reason to believe\r\nthat many of the donations were the fruits of the corrupt practices\r\nof high officials, the legacies being for their benefit hereafter.\r\n\r\nThe funds were severally administered by the four boards of San\r\nFrancisco, Santo Domingo, the Recoletos and Santa Isabel, controlled\r\nby one general board of management. In 1850 the Spanish Government,\r\nin the exercise of its right (_Real patronato_) to intervene in all\r\necclesiastical administrative affairs, ordered these funds to be\r\ntransferred to a banking establishment entitled the \"Banco Espanol\r\nde Isabel II.,\" more generally known as the \"Banco Espanol-Filipino\"\r\n(q.v.). The _Obras Pias_ funds constituted the original capital of\r\nthis bank. The board, presided over by the Archbishop, still continued\r\nto control the manipulation of these funds by the bank, the income\r\nderived from the original capital having to be paid out in accordance\r\nwith the wills of the several founders of the fund. Up to the close\r\nof Spanish rule, money was lent out of this fund on mortgages in and\r\nnear Manila, at six per cent. interest per annum.\r\n\r\n[116] It happened at this date that the dues, etc., equalled 17 per\r\ncent. on the anticipated 1,000,000 pesos, but they were not computed\r\nby percentage. The Royal Dues were a fixed sum since about the year\r\n1625, so that when the legal value of the shipments was much less,\r\nthe dues and other expenses represented a much higher percentage. The\r\ncharges were as follows, viz.:--\r\n\r\n\r\n    Royal Dues.                                          P160,000\r\n    Port Dues at Acapulco.                                  2,000\r\n    Disbursements paid in Manila on the ship's departure.   7,500\r\n    Port and Anchorage Dues on arrival in Philippines.        500\r\n\r\n                                                         P170,000\r\n\r\n\r\n[117] \"La Libertad del comercio de Filipinas,\" by Manuel Azcarraga.\r\n\r\n[118] Mr. John B. Butler, who was born in 1800, resided many years\r\nin Manila, and married a native wife. He died on October 4, 1855, in\r\nLondon, whence his mortal remains were brought to Manila in 1860, at\r\nthe instance of his widow, and interred in Saint Augustine's Church,\r\nnear an altar on the left side of the nave. The site is marked by a\r\nmarble inscribed slab.\r\n\r\n[119] The Peace of Utrecht, signed in 1713, settled the succession of\r\nPhilip, the French Dauphin, to the Spanish throne, whilst among the\r\nconcessions which England gained for herself under this treaty was a\r\nconvention with Spain, known as the _Asiento_ contract. This gave the\r\nBritish the right to send one shipload of merchandise yearly to the\r\nSpanish colonies of America. Nevertheless, many ships went instead of\r\none. An armed contest ensued (1739-42), and although the Spaniards\r\nlost several galleons in naval combats undertaken by Admiral Vernon\r\nand Commodore Anson, the British losses were not inconsiderable.\r\n\r\nSo prejudicial to the vital interests of Spain was the abuse of\r\nthe ceded right held to be that the earliest efforts of the first\r\nnew Cabinet under Ferdinand VI. were engaged in a revision of the\r\ncommercial differences between that country and England. England\r\nwas persuaded to relinquish the _Asiento_ contract in exchange for\r\nadvantages of greater consideration in another direction.\r\n\r\nAbout a century ago England took over from Spain Nootka Sound,\r\na station on the Pacific coast, where a nourishing fur trade was\r\ncarried on by British settlers. The cession was accorded under a solemn\r\npromise not to trade thence with the Spanish colonies of South America.\r\n\r\n[120] For example: _vide_ \"Memoria leida por el Secretario de la Camara\r\nde Comercio de Manila, Don F. de P.

They proposed to propitiate him by throwing live children\r\ninto the river; consequently many mothers migrated with their infants\r\nuntil they heard that the difficulty was overcome.\r\n\r\n[131] The sale of Alcohol was a Government monopoly until\r\n1862.

The natives have given it the name of _Bulaclac ng tubo_\r\n(Sugar-cane flower). It destroys the saccharine properties of the\r\ncane. The bitter juice of this weed has been found to be a useful\r\npalliative for certain diseases.\r\n\r\n[134] Extract from a letter dated September 29, 1885, from\r\nH.

Also,\r\nfor more than a century, they were any day subject to hostilities from\r\nthe Portuguese, whilst the aggressive foreign policy of the mother\r\ncountry during the 17th century exposed them to reprisals by the Dutch\r\nfleets, which in 1643 threatened the city of Manila. Formerly the\r\ndrawbridges were raised, and the city was closed and under sentinels\r\nfrom 11 o'clock p.m. until 4 o'clock a.m. It continued so until 1852,\r\nwhen, in consequence of the earthquake of that year, it was decreed\r\nthat the city should thenceforth remain open night and day. The\r\nwalled city was officially styled the _Plaza de Manila_, its last\r\nSpanish military governor being General Rizzo, who left for Europe in\r\nDecember, 1898. The most modern drawbridge entrance was the _Puerta\r\nde Isabel II_, (1861), facing the Pasig River.\r\n\r\n[163] The Cathedral has been destroyed four times by fire and\r\nearthquake, and rebuilt by successive archbishops.\r\n\r\n[164] _Mariveles_.--Much historical interest is attached to this\r\nplace. It was the chief port of the _Jurisdiction of Mariveles_\r\nunder the old territorial division which comprised the island now\r\ncalled Corregidor. Mariveles is now included in the Province of Bataan.\r\n\r\nThe first Spanish missionary who attempted to domesticate the natives\r\nof the Mariveles coast was stoned by them, and died in Manila\r\nin consequence. An insubordinate Archbishop was once banished to\r\nMariveles. Through the narrow channel between this port and Corregidor\r\nIsland, known as _Boca chica_, came swarms of Asiatic trading-junks\r\nevery spring for over two centuries. Forming the extreme point of\r\nManila Bay, here was naturally the watchguard for the safety of the\r\ncapital. It was the point whence could be descried the movements of\r\nforeign enemies--Dutch, British, Mahometan, Chinese, etc.; it was the\r\nlast refuge for ships about to venture from the Islands to foreign\r\nparts. Yet, with all these antecedents, it is, to-day, one of the\r\npoorest and most primitive villages of the Colony. From its aspect\r\none could almost imagine it to be at the furthermost extremity of\r\nthe Archipelago. Its ancient name was _Camaya_, and how it came to\r\nbe called Mariveles is accounted for in the following interesting\r\nlegend:--About the beginning of the 17th century one of the Mexican\r\ngalleons brought to Manila a family named Velez, whose daughter was\r\ncalled Maria. When she was 17 years of age this girl took the veil\r\nin Santa Clara Convent (_vide_ p. 81), and there responded to the\r\nattentions of a Franciscan monk, who fell so desperately in love\r\nwith her that they determined to elope to Camaya and wait there for\r\nthe galleon which was to leave for Mexico in the following July. The\r\ngirl, disguised in a monk's habit, fled from her convent, and the\r\nlovers arrived safely in Camaya in a hired canoe, tired out after the\r\nsea-passage under a scorching sun. The next day they went out to meet\r\nthe galleon, which, however, had delayed her sailing. In the meantime\r\nthe elopement had caused great scandal in Manila. A proclamation was\r\npublished by the town-crier calling upon the inhabitants to give\r\nup the culprits, under severe penalties for disobedience. Nothing\r\nresulted, until the matter oozed out through a native who was aware\r\nof their departure. Then an alderman of the city set out in a prahu\r\nin pursuit of the amorous fugitives, accompanied by a notary and a\r\ndozen arquebusiers. After searching in vain all over the island now\r\ncalled Corregidor, they went to Camaya, and there found the young lady,\r\nMaria, on the beach in a most pitiable condition, with her dress torn\r\nto shreds, and by her side the holy friar, wearied and bleeding from\r\nthe wounds he had received whilst fighting with the savage natives\r\nwho disputed his possession of the fair maiden. The search-party\r\nfound there a canoe, in which the friar was conveyed to Manila in\r\ncustody, whilst the girl was taken charge of by the alderman in the\r\nprahu. From Manila the sinful priest was sent to teach religion and\r\nmorality to the Visaya tribes; the romantic nun was sent back to the\r\nCity of Mexico to suffer perpetual reclusion in a convent.\r\n\r\nFrom these events, it is said, arose the names of _Corregidor_\r\n(Alderman) Island, which lies between the rocks known as _Fraile_\r\n(Friar) and _Monja_ (Nun), whilst the lovers' refuge thenceforth took\r\nthe name of _Mariveles_ (Maria Velez).\r\n\r\nShips arriving from foreign or Philippine infected ports were\r\nquarantined off Mariveles, under Spanish regulations. During the\r\ngreat cholera epidemic of 1882 a Lazaretto was established here.\r\n\r\n[165] The _abacus_ consists of a frame with a number of parallel\r\nwires on which counting-beads are strung. It is in common use in China.\r\n\r\n[166] _Escolta_ (meaning Escort), the principal thoroughfare in the\r\nbusiness quarter (Binondo), is said to have been so named during the\r\nBritish occupation (1762-63), when the British Commander-in-Chief\r\npassed through it daily with his escort.\r\n\r\n[167] On the site of this last bridge the _Puente de Barcas_ (Pontoon\r\nBridge) existed from 1632 to 1863, when it was destroyed by the great\r\nearthquake of that year. The new stone bridge was opened in 1875,\r\nand called the _Puente de Espana_.\r\n\r\n[168] The burthen of a native play in the provinces was almost\r\ninvariably founded on the contests between the Mahometans of the\r\nSouth and the Christian natives under Spanish dominion.\r\n\r\nThe Spaniards, in attaching the denomination of _Moros_ to the\r\nMahometans of Sulu, associated them in name with the Mahometan\r\nMoors who held sway over a large part of Hispania for over seven\r\ncenturies (711-1492). A \"_Moro Moro\"_ performance is usually a\r\ndrama--occasionally a melodrama--in which the native actors, clad in\r\nall the glittering finery of Mahometan nobility and Christian chivalry,\r\nassemble in battle array before the Mahometan princesses, to settle\r\ntheir disputes under the combined inspirations of love and religious\r\npersuasion. The princesses, one after the other, pining under the\r\ndictates of the heart in defiance of their creed, leave their fate\r\nto be sealed by the outcome of deadly combat between the contending\r\nfactions. Armed to the teeth, the cavaliers of the respective parties\r\nmarch to and fro, haranguing each other in monotonous tones. After a\r\nlong-winded, wearisome challenge, they brandish their weapons and meet\r\nin a series of single combats which merge in a general _melee_ as the\r\nprinces are vanquished and the hand of the disputed enchantress is won.\r\n\r\nThe dialogue is in the idiom of the district where the performance\r\nis given, and the whole play (lasting from four to six nights) is\r\nbrief compared with Chinese melodrama, which often extends to a month\r\nof nights.\r\n\r\nJudged from the standard of European histrionism, the plot is weak\r\nfrom the sameness and repetition of the theme. The declamation\r\nis unnatural, and void of vigour and emphasis. The same tone is\r\nmaintained from beginning to end, whether it be in expression of\r\nexpostulatory defiance, love, joy, or despair. But the masses were\r\nintensely amused; thus the full object was achieved. They seemed\r\nnever to tire of gazing at the situations created and applauding\r\nvociferously the feigned defeat of their traditional arch-foes.\r\n\r\n[169] The favourite game of the Tagalogs is _Panguingui_--of the\r\nChinese _Chapdiki_.\r\n\r\n[170] The Government House, located in the city, which was thrown down\r\nin the earthquake of 1863, has not been rebuilt. Its reconstruction\r\nwas only commenced by the Spaniards in 1895. The Gov.-General\r\ntherefore resided after 1863 at his suburban palace at Malacanan,\r\non the river-side.\r\n\r\n[171] \"Aventures d'un gentilhomme Breton aux Iles Philippines,\"\r\npar Paul de la Gironniere.

There were many Freemasons who were leaguers, but\r\nnot _because_ they were Freemasons, as also there were thousands\r\nof leaguers who knew nothing of Freemasonry. There is little doubt\r\nthat Freemasonry suggested the bare idea of that other secret society\r\ncalled _Katipunan_, whose signs and symbols were of masonic design,\r\nbut whose aims were totally different. It is probable, too, that the\r\nliberty which Freemasons enjoyed to meet in secret session was taken\r\nadvantage of by the leaguers. There were risings in the Islands\r\nlong before the introduction of Freemasonry. This secret society\r\nwas introduced into the Colony a little before the year 1850. In\r\n1893 the first lodges of the Spanish Grand Orient were opened,\r\nand there were never more than 16 lodges of this Order up to the\r\nevacuation by the Spaniards. Each lodge had about 30 members, or,\r\nsay, a total of 500. The Spanish deputy, Dr. Miguel Morayta, in his\r\nspeech in the Spanish Congress in April, 1904, stated that General\r\nRamon Blanco's reply to Father Mariano Gil (the discoverer of the\r\n_Katipunan_) was that the identity of Freemasonry with _Katipunan_\r\n\"existed only in the brains of the friars and fanatical Spaniards.\"\r\n\r\n[174] By intermarriage and blood relationship Don Pedro P. Rojas is\r\nallied with several of the best Manila families. His grandfather,\r\nDon Domingo Rojas, a prominent citizen in his time, having become a\r\nvictim of intrigue, was confined in the Fortress of Santiago, under\r\nsentence of death. The day prior to that fixed for his execution, he\r\nwas visited by a friend, and the next morning when the executioner\r\nentered his cell, Don Domingo was found in a dying condition,\r\napparently from the effect of poison. Don Domingo had a son Jose and\r\na daughter Marguerita. On their father's death, they and Jose's son,\r\nthe present Don Pedro P. Rojas, went to Spain, where Dona Marguerita\r\nespoused a Spaniard, Don Antonio de Ayala, and Don Jose obtained from\r\nthe Spanish Government a declaration stating that whereas Don Domingo\r\nhad been unjustly condemned to capital punishment, the Gov.-General\r\nwas ordered to refund, out of his own pocket, to the Rojas family\r\nthe costs of the trial. The Rojas and Ayala families then returned\r\nto the Philippines, where Don Antonio de Ayala made a considerable\r\nfortune in business and had two daughters, one of whom, Dona Carmen,\r\nmarried Don Pedro P. Rojas, and the other wedded Don Jacobo Zobel, an\r\napothecary of large means and of German descent. Don Pedro P. Rojas,\r\nwho was born in 1848, has two sons and two daughters. The three\r\nfamilies belonged to the _elite_ of Manila society, whilst the Rojas\r\nand the Ayalas acquired a just reputation both for their enterprising\r\nspirit, which largely benefited the Colony, and for their charitable\r\nphilanthropy towards all classes.\r\n\r\n[175] _Aguinaldo_ is the Spanish for Christmas-box.\r\n\r\n[176] Part of a conversation which I had with Emilio Aguinaldo at\r\nhis house at Cauit (Cavite Viejo) on July 26, 1904.\r\n\r\n[177] _Cauit_ signifies, in Tagalog, Fish-hook.\r\n\r\n[178] _Sungay_ signifies, in Tagalog, Deer.\r\n\r\n[179] _Imus_. The history of this place is interesting. In the 18th\r\ncentury a banished Spaniard of distinguished family settled there\r\nand supplied water to the natives for irrigation purposes. Some years\r\nafterwards, on the death of his wife, this gentleman returned to Spain\r\nand left the place in charge of a friar, Francisco de Santiago. As\r\nthe owner never claimed the property, it fell definitely into\r\nthe possession of the friars. A church was erected there at the\r\npeople's expense. Later on the friar in charge extorted from the\r\nnatives material and labour, without payment, for the building of\r\na manor-house, but he was poisoned soon after it was finished. His\r\nsuccessor was still bolder, and allowed escaped criminals to take\r\nsanctuary in his church to show his superiority to the civil law. After\r\ninnumerable disputes and troubles with the natives, it developed\r\ninto a fine property, comprising 27,500 acres of arable land, which\r\nthe Recoletos claimed as theirs and rented it out to the natives. Its\r\npossession was the cause of the important risings of Paran and Camerino\r\n(_vide_ pp. 105, 106) and many other minor disturbances.\r\n\r\n[180] \"Sucesos de las Islas Filipinas,\" por el Dr. Antonio de Morga,\r\nanotada por Jose Rizal.

Meyer-Van Loo, 1891.\r\n\r\n[182] Father Mariano Gil died in Spain in the spring of 1904.\r\n\r\n[183] Rizal's brother and sister were keeping (in 1904) the \"_Dimas\r\nAlang_\" restaurant, 62, _Calle Sacristia_, Binondo (Manila). It is\r\nso named after the pseudonym under which their distinguished brother\r\noften wrote patriotic articles.\r\n\r\nOne of the ten annual official holidays, or feast days, appointed by\r\nthe Civil Commission is \"Rizal Day,\" December 30.\r\n\r\nThe P2 banknote of the new Philippine currency bears a vignette of\r\nDr. Rizal.\r\n\r\nThe Manila Province of Spanish times is now called Rizal Province and\r\nwith it is incorporated what was formerly the Morong District. Probably\r\none-third of the towns of the colony have either a _Plaza de Rizal_,\r\nor a _Calle de Rizal_; it is about as general as the _Piazza di\r\nVittorio Emanuele_ throughout Italy.\r\n\r\nA public subscription was open for about three years to defray\r\nthe cost of a Rizal monument to be erected on the Luneta Esplanade\r\n(Ins. Gov. Act No. 243). By March 7, 1905, a total of P103,753.89\r\nhad been collected, including the sum of P30,000 voted by the Insular\r\nGovernment.\r\n\r\nOne is led to wonder what _role_ in Philippine affairs Rizal would\r\nhave assumed had he outlived the rebellion.\r\n\r\n[184] It is alleged that this copy was removed from the archives\r\nabout April, 1898, for the defence of a certain general in Madrid.\r\n\r\n[185] _Biac-na-bato _signifies, in Tagalog, Split Stone.\r\n\r\nThis was the third time, during the 19th century, that the Spanish\r\nGov.-General had been constrained to conclude a treaty with native\r\nrebels. In 1835 a certain Feliciano Paran raised the standard of\r\nrevolt against the friars' claim to the Imus estate (Cavite), and\r\nafter many fruitless attempts to suppress him, and much bloodshed,\r\nthe _Treaty of Malacanan_ was signed by the rebel chief and the\r\nGov.-General. Paran was then appointed Colonel of Militia with the\r\nmonthly pay of P50. He lived peacefully in _Calle San Marcelino_,\r\nManila, until a fresh outbreak (led by another) occurred, when the\r\nSpaniards made this a pretext to seize Paran and deport him to the\r\nLadrone Islands (_vide_ p. 105).\r\n\r\nIn 1870, during the command of General La Torre, a certain\r\nCamerino held the Province of Cavite for a long time against the\r\nSpaniards. Camerino's plan was to remain in ambush whilst the\r\nrank-and-file of the Spaniards advanced, and then pick off the\r\nofficers. So many of them were killed that influence was brought\r\nto bear on the General, who consented to sign the _Treaty of\r\nNavotas_. Camerino was appointed Colonel of Militia and lived in Trozo\r\n(Manila) until the Cavite rising in 1872, when he and six others were\r\nexecuted for their past deeds (_vide_ p. 106).\r\n\r\n[186] The original of the above document was read in public session\r\nof Congress in Madrid, on June 16, 1898, by the Deputy Senor Muro.\r\n\r\n[187] _Vide_ Pedro A. Paterno's allusion to this at p. 399.\r\n\r\n[188] Manuel Godoy, of obscure family, was originally a common soldier\r\nin the Guards. He became field-marshal, Duke of Alcudia, Grandee of\r\nSpain, Councillor of State, and Cavalier of the Golden Fleece. For his\r\nintervention in the Peace of Basilea he received the title of Principe\r\nde la Paz. Baldomero Espartero was a successful general, who brought\r\nthe first Carlist war to a close and concluded the Treaty of Vergara\r\n(1839), for which (in 1840) he was granted the titles of Duque de la\r\nVictoria and Principe de Vergara.\r\n\r\n[189] This steamer came into Manila flying the French ensign, and\r\npainted to resemble one of the Russian Volunteer Fleet, to avoid\r\ncapture on the way.\r\n\r\n[190] The precise terms of the treaty or agreement made between\r\nthe representative of the Philippine Government and the rebel\r\nchiefs are hitherto enveloped in mystery; but even though all the\r\npersonal testimony referred to in this chapter were impugned, there\r\nis convincing circumstantial evidence that Emilio Aguinaldo and\r\nhis followers received a very considerable amount of money from the\r\nPhilippine Treasury _conditionally_. In the Suit No. 6 of 1899 in the\r\nSupreme Court of Hong-Kong, T. Sandico and others _versus_ R. Wildman\r\n(all the original filed documents of which I have examined), sworn\r\nevidence was given to show that $200,000 Mexican of the sum received\r\nby Aguinaldo was deposited in his name in the Chartered Bank of India,\r\nAustralia and China. It is not feasible to suppose that this sum was\r\npaid to or accepted by Aguinaldo _unconditionally_.\r\n\r\n[191] On February 15, 1898, the U.S. man-of-war _Maine_, whilst lying\r\nin the harbour of Havana, was, accidentally or intentionally, blown\r\nup, causing the death of 266 of her crew. Public opinion in America\r\nattributed the disaster to Spanish malice. The Spaniards indignantly\r\nrepudiated this charge and invited an official inquest. Again, at the\r\nConference of December 6, 1898, the Spanish Commissioners of the Peace\r\nCommission at Paris proposed an additional article to the treaty \"to\r\nappoint an International Commission to be entrusted with investigating\r\nthe causes of, and responsibility for, the _Maine_ catastrophe,\"\r\nbut the proposal was rejected by the American Commissioners.\r\n\r\n[192] Mirs Bay has _since_ become British, being included in the\r\nextended Kowloon Concession on the mainland of China opposite\r\nHong-Kong.\r\n\r\n[193] The distance from Corregidor Island to Manila City is 27 miles.\r\n\r\n[194] In July, 1904, I saw five rusty hulls--remnant of the Spanish\r\nfleet--afloat in Cavite harbour.\r\n\r\n[195] Admiral Patricio Montojo, born in 1831, entered the navy at the\r\nage of 14. After the Battle of Cavite he left for Europe in October,\r\n1898, and was committed to prison, March 3, 1899, pending the trial\r\nby court-martial which condemned him to compulsory retirement from\r\nthe service. He died in 1902, aged 71 years.\r\n\r\n[196] _Vide_ Senate Document No. 62, Part II., 55th Congress, 3rd\r\nSession, pp. 350-6. Published by the Government Printing Office,\r\nWashington, 1899.\r\n\r\n[197] The _Macabebes_ who came so conspicuously into prominence\r\nduring the Rebellion of 1896 are the inhabitants of the town of\r\nMacabebe and its dependent wards, situated in Lower Pampanga, near\r\nthe Hagonoy River. They are the only Filipinos who have persistently\r\nand systematically opposed the revolutionary faction of their own free\r\nwill, without bribe or extraneous influence. No one seems to be able to\r\nexplain exactly why they should have adopted this course. They aided\r\nthe Spaniards against the rebels, and also the Americans against the\r\ninsurgents. All I have been able to learn of them in the locality is\r\nthat they keep exclusively to themselves, and have little sympathy\r\nfor, and no cordial intercourse with, the natives of other towns,\r\neither in their own province or elsewhere. A generation ago the\r\nMacabebes had a bad reputation for their petty piratical depredations\r\naround the north shore of Manila Bay and the several mouths of the\r\nHagonoy River, and it is possible that their exclusiveness results\r\nfrom their consciousness of having been shunned by the more reputable\r\ninhabitants. The total population of Macabebe is about 14,000.\r\n\r\n[198] The finding of the court says: \"Pasara a la seccion de reserva\r\ndel Estado Mayor General del Ejercito con incapacidad para obtener\r\ndestinos y sin figurar en la escala de los de dicha categoria.\" Signed\r\nby Canuto Garcia de Polavieja, dated April 28, 1899, and published\r\nin the _Gaceta de Madrid_.\r\n\r\n[199] It seems almost incredible that, even at this crisis, the\r\nSpaniards still counted on native auxiliaries to fight against their\r\nown kith and kin.\r\n\r\n[200] _Vide_ Senate Document No. 62, Part II., 55th Congress,\r\n3rd Session, p. 282. Published by the Government Printing Office,\r\nWashington, 1899.\r\n\r\n[201] Captain T. Bentley Mott, A.D.C to General Merritt, writing in\r\n_Scribner's Magazine_ (December, 1898) says: \"Neither the fleet nor\r\nthe army was, at this time, ready for a general engagement. The army\r\ndid not have, all told, enough ammunition for more than _one day_\r\nof hard fighting, and only a part of this was in the camp.\" Admiral\r\nDewey had then been in possession of Manila bay and port three months\r\nand 12 days.\r\n\r\n[202] _Vide_ Senate Document No. 62, Part II., 55th Congress, 3rd\r\nSession, p. 491.\r\n\r\n[203] \"The Spanish Commander-in-Chief fled from the city shortly\r\nbefore it was attacked.\" Senate Document 62, Part II., 55th Congress,\r\n3rd Session, p. 146.\r\n\r\n[204] Barasoain is another parish, but it is only separated from\r\nMalolos by a bridged river. It is only five minutes' walk from Malolos\r\nChurch to Barasoain Church. Since the American advent the two parishes\r\nhave been united.\r\n\r\n[205] For want of space I am obliged to omit the summary of all the\r\ndebates in the Revolutionary Congress of 1898, printed reports of\r\nwhich I have before me.\r\n\r\n[206] _Vide_ Senate Document No. 62, Part II., 55th Congress,\r\n3rd Session, p. 371.

Published by the Government Printing Office, Washington, 1899.\r\n\r\n[208] The Treaty was ratified by the Senate by 57 votes to 27 on\r\nFebruary 6, 1899.\r\n\r\n[209] The Paco church was an ancient, imposing building; to-day there\r\nis not a stone left to show that it ever existed, and the plot is\r\nperfectly bare.\r\n\r\n[210] General Diego de los Rios was remaining in Manila to negotiate\r\nwith the insurgents the liberation of the Spanish prisoners (_vide_\r\np. 477).\r\n\r\n[211] The decree says:--\"Seeing that the Spanish garrison in Baler,\r\nconsisting of a handful of men, isolated, without hope of succour,\r\nis, by its valour and constant heroism worthy of universal admiration,\r\nand in view of its defence, comparable only with the legendary valour\r\nof the sons of the Cid and of Pelayo, I render homage to military\r\nvirtues, and, interpreting the sentiments of the Philippine Republic,\r\non the proposal of my Secretary of War, and in agreement with my\r\nCouncil of State, I hereby decree as follows, viz.:--That the said\r\nforces shall no longer be considered our prisoners, but our friends,\r\nand consequently the necessary passes shall be furnished them enabling\r\nthem to return to their country. Given in Tarlac on the 30th of June,\r\n1899. The President of the Republic,--_Emilio Aguinaldo_.\"\r\n\r\n[212] After the war I visited this former insurgent stronghold. Of\r\nthe ancient church three walls and a quarter of the roof were left\r\nstanding. There was nothing inside but shrubs, which had grown up to\r\n3 feet high. In front of the church ruins stood an ironical emblem\r\nof the insurgents' power in the shape of an antiquated Spanish\r\ncannon on carriage, with the nozzle broken off. Judging from the\r\nnumerous newly-erected dwellings in this little town, I surmise that\r\nthree-fourths of it must have been destroyed during the war.\r\n\r\n[213] A Chinese half-caste Pampango. I knew him intimately as a\r\nplanter. He was deported to and died a prisoner in the Island of Guam\r\nin 1901.\r\n\r\n[214] In 1905 one of the wealthiest men in the Colony was arrested and\r\nbrought to trial on the charge of having paid, or caused to be paid,\r\nthe sum of P 20 to an outlaw in Batangas Province. After putting the\r\naccused to a deal of expense and annoyance, the Government suddenly\r\nwithdrew from the case, leaving the public in doubt as to the justice\r\nor injustice of the arraignment.\r\n\r\n[215] A very intelligent man who was appointed Civil Governor of La\r\nLaguna Province when the war terminated.\r\n\r\n[216] Early in 1905 the Court of Nueva Ecija passed sentence of\r\nimprisonment for life on this man for murder.\r\n\r\n[217] Raymundo Melliza, a Visayan lawyer, who afterwards became\r\nProvincial Governor of Yloilo, is the son of Cornelio Melliza, of Molo,\r\na man much respected both by natives and foreigners.\r\n\r\n[218] A verbal statement made to me by ex-insurgent General Pablo\r\nAraneta, which I took down in writing at the time of the interview.\r\n\r\n[219] When I asked ex-General Pablo Araneta the same question he\r\nnaively explained to me that it was thought if the Americans came\r\nashore and found the town in ruins they would relinquish their\r\nundertaking!\r\n\r\n[220] The See of Jaro was created in 1867. The town was already rich\r\nwith its trade in _pina_ and _jusi_ (_vide_ p. 283, footnote). Up to\r\n1876 Yloilo town was merely a group of houses built for commercial\r\nconvenience.\r\n\r\n[221] _Vide_ p. 169. _Castila_ in the North; _Cachila_ in the South;\r\nsignifying European, and said to be derived from the Spaniards'\r\nwar-cry of _Viva Castilla!_\r\n\r\n[222] \"Water-cure\" was a method adopted by the Americans. Water was\r\npoured down the throat of the victim until the stomach was distended to\r\nthe full; then it was pressed out again and the operation repeated. The\r\npretext for this mode of torture was to extort confession; but it\r\nwas quite inefficacious; because the victim was usually disposed to\r\nsay anything, true or false, for his own salvation. The \"water-cure\"\r\noperation, in vogue for awhile all over the Islands, proved fatal in\r\nmany cases. It is now a penal offence (Phil. Com. Act 619, Sec. 2).\r\n\r\n[223] Otong in olden times was a place of importance when the galleons\r\nput in there on their way to and from Mexico, taking the longer route\r\nin order to avoid the strong currents of the San Bernardino Straits.\r\n\r\nUnder the old territorial division, the Jurisdiction of Otong\r\ncomprised all Panay Island (except a strip of land all along the\r\nnorth coast--formerly Panay Province, now called Capis) and a point\r\nhere and there on the almost unexplored Negros coast. Galleons were\r\nsometimes built at Otong, which was on several occasions attacked by\r\nthe Dutch. Yloilo at that time was an insignificant fishing-village.\r\n\r\n[224] A half-caste Chinese family of large means and local influence.\r\n\r\n[225] Esteban de la Rama is of the family of the late Isidro de la\r\nRama, a well-known prosperous and enterprising Yloilo merchant. Pedro\r\nRegalado, personally known to me, is the son of my late friend Jose\r\nRegalado, at one time a wealthy middleman, who, however, lost his\r\nfortune in adverse speculations. Pedro Regalado and I were, at one\r\ntime, together in Hong-Kong, where he learnt English. On the entry\r\nof the American troops into Yloilo he was imprisoned on a charge\r\nof disaffection, but shortly released and appointed a government\r\ninterpreter.\r\n\r\n[226] The protest contained the following significant clauses, viz:\r\n(1) \"Ceder a tal exigencia en vista de la superioridad de las armas\r\nAmericanas. (2) No tener poder, ni la provincia ni todos los habitantes\r\njuntos, de ejecutar actas como esta, prohibidas por el Presidente de\r\nla Republica, Senor Emilio Aguinaldo.\"--Extracts taken by myself from\r\nthe official copy of the protest.\r\n\r\n[227] The approximate number of prisoners was as follows, viz:--\r\n\r\n\r\n    Military Officers (including Gen. Leopoldo Garcia Pena)     200\r\n    Military Regular troops                                   8,000\r\n    Civil Servants and private Civilians and families           560\r\n    Ecclesiastics and Nuns (including Bishop Hevia\r\n    Campomanes, of the diocese of Nueva Segovia                 400\r\n\r\n                             Total in long captivity, about   9,160\r\n\r\n    Taken prisoners and released voluntarily, or through\r\n    personal influences, or escaped from the camps--about     1,840\r\n\r\n                                   Approximate Grand Total   11,000\r\n\r\n\r\n[228] Baron Honore Frederic Adhemar Bourgeois du Marais, a Frenchman of\r\nnoble birth and noble sentiments, was the son of Viscount Bourgeois du\r\nMarais. Born at Bourg Port, in the Algerian province of Constantina,\r\nin 1882 he left Europe with a party of gentlemen colonists in the\r\ns.s. _Nouvelle Bretagne_, intending to settle in Port Breton, in\r\nAustralasia. The vessel having put into Manila, she was detained\r\nfor debt, but escaped from port in the teeth of a hurricane. A\r\nSpanish gunboat went in pursuit and brought her back, and Baron Du\r\nMarais decided to remain in the Philippines. For several years he\r\nwas associated with his countryman M. Daillard in the development\r\nof the Jalajala Estate (_vide_ p. 360). On M. Daillard's decease\r\nhe became the representative of the \"Compania Tabacalera\" at their\r\nvast estate of Santa Lucia (Tarlac), which prospered under his able\r\nmanagement. His wonderful tact in the handling of natives secured their\r\nattachment to him. After fifteen years' absence from home he went to\r\nEurope to recruit his health, returning to the Islands in November,\r\n1898. After the ill-fated mission of humanity referred to above, his\r\nbody lay hidden in the jungle for nearly two years, until November,\r\n1900, when it was discovered and brought to Manila for interment\r\nat the Paco cemetery. The funeral, which took place on November 25,\r\nwas one of the most imposing ceremonies of the kind ever witnessed in\r\nManila. Monsignor Chapelle officiated at the _Requiem_ mass celebrated\r\nat the Cathedral in the presence of the chief American authorities,\r\nthe French and Spanish Consuls-General and representatives of the\r\nforeign residents, Chambers of Commerce, the Army and Navy, the Clubs,\r\nthe Press, and every important collectivity. The cortege was, moreover,\r\nescorted by a large body of troops to the last resting-place of this\r\ngallant hero.\r\n\r\n[229] By Royal Decree of June, 1897, a _Philippine Loan_ was\r\nauthorized, secured on Custom-house revenue and general guarantee of\r\nSpain. The Loan was for 200 millions of pesetas in hypothecary bonds\r\nof the Philippine Treasury, bearing 6 per cent, interest, redeemable\r\nat par in 40 years.\r\n\r\n\r\n    Series A.    250,000 Bonds of 500 pts. = 125 millions\r\n    Series B.    750,000 Bonds of 100 pts. =  75 millions\r\n\r\n\r\nFirst issue of 100 millions A at 92 per cent. was made on July 15,\r\n1897.\r\n\r\n[230] Born at Aliaga (Nueva Ecija) June 17, 1877, he raised a troop\r\nof rebels in his native town and joined General Llaneras. Appointed\r\ncolonel in June, 1897, he was one of the chiefs who retired to\r\nHong-Kong after the alleged Treaty of Biac-na-bato. He returned to\r\nthe Islands with Aguinaldo, and became a general officer at the age\r\nof twenty-three years.\r\n\r\n[231] At one time Cornelio Felizardo had an American in his gang. This\r\ndegenerate, Luis A. Unselt, was fortunately captured and sentenced,\r\non April 6, 1904, to twenty-five years' imprisonment as a deserter\r\nfrom the constabulary and bandit.\r\n\r\nPrevious to this event, the piracy of Johnston and Hermann in the\r\nsouthern islands caused much sensation at the time.\r\n\r\nIn September, 1905, it was rumoured that, in order to escape capture,\r\nCornelio Felizardo had committed suicide.\r\n\r\nOne can judge of the ferocity of these men by Clause 3 of what Julian\r\nMontalon calls his Law No. 9. Dated April 10, 1904, it says:--\r\n\r\n\r\n    \"The Filipino who serves the American Government as scout,\r\n    constabulary or secret-service man, who does not sympathize with\r\n    his native country, shall, if caught, immediately suffer the\r\n    penalty of having the tendons of his feet cut, and the fingers\r\n    of both hands crushed.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nThere were many cases of cutting off the lips; two victims of this\r\natrocity were brought to Manila in 1905, during _El Renacimiento_\r\ntrial (_vide_ p. 550).\r\n\r\n[232] This establishment was put up for sale by tender in 1904. The\r\nprospectus stated as follows:--\r\n\r\n\r\n    Revenue for one year            gold $332,194.17\r\n    Disbursements for one year            198,338.93\r\n\r\n                                  Profit $133,855.24\r\n\r\n\r\nReserve price one million dollars gold. Conditions of payment\r\none-third cash, and two-thirds in three annual payments with six per\r\ncent. interest per annum guaranteed by mortgage on the building and\r\nplant or other acceptable security. It was not stated whether the\r\nsale included a monopoly of army supply.\r\n\r\n[233] _Sampaloc_ signifies _Tamarind_ in Tagalog.\r\n\r\n[234] The first Philippine club was opened on November 6, 1898.\r\n\r\n[235] The _carromata_ is a two-wheeled spring vehicle with a light\r\nroof to keep off the sun and rain. In Spanish times it was commonly\r\nused by the natives in Manila and by all classes in the provinces,\r\nbeing a light, strong, and useful conveyance.\r\n\r\n[236] _Vide_ \"Official Roster of the Officers and Employees in the\r\nCivil Service in the Philippine Islands.\" Manila, Bureau of Public\r\nPrinting, 1904.\r\n\r\n[237] Independent Offices, i.e., not under control of a Civil\r\nCommission Secretary.\r\n\r\n[238] Under the \"Cooper Bill,\" which came into operation on March 20,\r\n1905, the Insular Government was authorized to increase the salaries\r\nof the Chief Justice and the associated judges to $10,500 and $10,000\r\ngold respectively. Under the same Act, judges of First Instance can\r\nbe called upon to serve in the Supreme Court when needed to form a\r\nquorum, for which service they are allowed ten pesos per day besides\r\ntheir travelling expenses from and to the place of their permanent\r\nappointments. By Philippine Commission Act No. 1,314, the salaries\r\nof the Chief Justice and associate judges were fixed at $10,000 each.\r\n\r\n[239] \"Report of the Philippine Commission, 1900.\" Published by the\r\nGovernment Printing Office, Washington, 1901.\r\n\r\n[240] Mr. William H. Taft, the first Civil Governor of the Philippines,\r\nwas born at Cincinnati (Ohio) on September 15, 1857. His father was\r\na jurist of repute, diplomat, and member of the Cabinet. After his\r\npreparatory schooling in his native town, W. H. Taft graduated at\r\nYale University in 1878, studied law at Cincinnati and was called\r\nto the bar in 1880. Since then he held several legal appointments\r\nup to the year 1900, when he became a district judge, which post he\r\nresigned on being commissioned to the Philippine Islands.\r\n\r\n[241] _Vide_ Senate Document No. 331, Part I., 57th Congress,\r\n1st Session.\r\n\r\n[242] Mr. Luke E. Wright, the second Civil Governor and first\r\nGov.-General of the Philippines, was born in Tennessee in 1847, the\r\nson of Judge Archibald Wright. At the age of sixteen he took arms in\r\nthe Confederate interest in the War of Secession. Called to the bar\r\nin 1868, he became a partner in his father's firm and held several\r\nimportant legal appointments. At the age of twenty-four he became\r\nAttorney-General, and held this post for eight years. A Democrat in\r\npolitics, he is a strong character, as generous and courteous as he\r\nis personally courageous.\r\n\r\n[243] \"Should we wish the Filipino people to judge of Americans by the\r\ndrunken, truculent American loafers who infest the small towns of the\r\nIslands, living on the fruits of the labour of Filipino women, and who\r\ngive us more trouble than any other element in the Islands? Should we\r\nwish the Filipino people to judge of American standards of honesty\r\nby reading the humiliating list of American official and unofficial\r\ndefaulters in these Islands?\"--_Extract from Governor W. H. Taft's\r\nspeech at the Union Reading College, Manila, in 1903, quoted in_\r\n\"Population of the Philippines,\" _Bulletin I, p. 9. Published by the\r\nBureau of the Census, 1904_.\r\n\r\n[244] From a statement kindly furnished to me by the Adjutant-General,\r\nColonel W. A. Simpson (Manila).\r\n\r\n[245] A \"contract\" Surgeon or Dental Surgeon is a civilian who comes\r\nto the Islands on a three-years' contract. He is only temporarily an\r\nArmy officer.\r\n\r\nGeneral Officers' pay is as follows; viz.:--\r\n\r\n\r\n    Lieut.-General, Active Service   $11,000; retired  $8,250 gold.\r\n    Maj.-General, Active Service      $7,500; retired  $5,625 gold.\r\n    Brig.-General, Active Service     $5,500; retired  $4,125 gold.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe monthly pay of a private serving in the Islands is $15.60 gold.\r\n\r\n[246] _Hadji_ signifies Knight, a title which any Mahometan can assume\r\nafter having made the pilgrimage to Mecca.\r\n\r\n[247] The Americans occupied and the Spaniards evacuated Jolo on May\r\n20, 1899.\r\n\r\n[248] _Vide_ Report of the Secretary of War for 1902, p. 18.\r\n\r\n[249] Camp Vicars is said to have an elevation of 2,000 feet above\r\nthe sea. Lake Lanao is reputed to be 1,500 feet above sea-level.\r\n\r\n[250] _Vide_ Captain J. J. Pershing's Report to the Adjutant-General\r\nin Manila, dated Camp Vicars, Mindanao, May 15, 1903.\r\n\r\n[251] _Vide_ Brig.-General Sumner's Report to the Adjutant-General\r\nin Manila, dated Zamboanga, Mindanao, June 13, 1903.\r\n\r\n[252] Maj.-General Leonard Wood, born October 9, 1860, was a doctor\r\nof medicine by profession. On the outbreak of war with Spain he\r\nwas appointed Colonel of the First Volunteer Cavalry in Cuba, with\r\nMr. Roosevelt (now the United States President) as Lieut.-Colonel. At\r\nthe close of the war he was promoted to Brig.-General, and on December\r\n13, 1899, received the appointment of Military Governor of Cuba,\r\nwhich he held until the government of that island was transferred to\r\nSenor Palma Estrada, the first President of the Cuban Republic. To\r\nhis brilliant reputation for statesmanship gained in the Antilles,\r\nGeneral Wood has now added the fame of a successful organizer of the\r\nSouthern Philippines. Beloved by his subordinates, his large-hearted\r\ngeniality wins him the admiration of all who know him, and even the\r\nrespect of the savage whom he had to coerce.\r\n\r\n[253] _Mindanao_, the name of this southern island, signifies \"Man\r\nof the Lake.\"\r\n\r\n[254] The limits and area of that portion of the Island under civil\r\ngovernment are defined in Philippine Commission Acts Nos. 127 and 128,\r\namended by Act No. 787. It is approximately all that land north of 8 deg.\r\nN. lat. and east of 123 deg. 34' E. long.\r\n\r\n[255] Under the above-cited Act No. 787, any military officer, from the\r\ncommander of the district downwards, holding concurrent civil office\r\nin the province receives his army pay, plus 20 per cent, of the same\r\nas remuneration for his civil service. The combined emolument of a\r\nmajor-general as military commander and provincial governor would,\r\ntherefore, be $9,000 gold.\r\n\r\n[256] Under Spanish rule the Moro country was divided thus:--Seven\r\ndistricts, namely, Zamboanga, Misamis, Surigao, Davao, Cottabato,\r\nBasilan, and Lanao, all under the Gov.-General of Mindanao. Jolo was\r\nruled independently of Mindanao under another governor.\r\n\r\n[257] Up to June 30, 1904, there was a total of 12 municipalities\r\norganized.\r\n\r\n[258] Philippine Commission Act No. 787, Section 13, Clause II,\r\nprovides that the Moro Government is to \"vest in their local or tribe\r\nrulers as nearly as possible the same authority over the people as\r\nthey now exercise.\" Clause L: \"To enact laws for the abolition of\r\nslavery, and the suppression of all slave-hunting and slave trade.\"\r\n\r\n[259] From a statement kindly furnished to me by the Military and\r\nProvincial Governor, Maj.-General Leonard Wood, June, 1904.\r\n\r\n[260] At Malabang about 500, at Parang-Parang 205, and at Jolo 744.\r\n\r\n[261] _Kudarangan Cotta _was situated on the north bank of the Rio\r\nGrande. Datto Piang's fort stands at the junction of this river and the\r\nBacat River. Fort Reina Regente, established in this neighbourhood,\r\nwas the most inland Spanish stronghold in Mindanao, and was at one\r\nperiod in Spanish times garrisoned by 800 to 1,000 convict troops\r\n(_disciplinarios_).\r\n\r\n[262] _Panglima_ signifies General, or Chief of Warriors.\r\n\r\n[263] The father of Mr. J. Schueck was a German sea captain, who got\r\ninto trouble with the Spaniards because he traded directly with the\r\nSultan of Sulu. His ship and all he possessed were seized, and Captain\r\nSchueck decided to settle in the Island under the protection of the\r\nSultan. He took a Mora wife, became a very prosperous planter, and the\r\nSpaniards were eventually only too glad to cultivate his friendship. He\r\ndied in 1887, leaving three sons; one is the gentleman mentioned above,\r\nanother is the military interpreter, and the third manages the fine\r\nproperty and trading interests of the family. Mr. J. Schueck's two\r\nsisters-in-law are Moras.\r\n\r\n[264] _Vide_ Legislative Council Act No. 51, relative to the Pearl\r\nFisheries, in which the Sultan claims hereditary right.

Wallace's report to the Adjutant-General to the effect that\r\nat Cagayan de Jolo, on May 21, 1903, he gave instructions that the\r\nSultan's emissaries were not to be allowed to collect the customary\r\nP5 per capita of tribute.\r\n\r\n[265] _Vide_ Report of the Moro Province for the fiscal year ending\r\nJune 30, 1904.\r\n\r\n[266] Under the _Homestead Law_, 39.54 acres of Government land\r\nmay be acquired by any citizen of the Philippine Islands or of the\r\nUnited States, and 2,530 acres by a corporation. The grant or sale\r\nof such land is subject to occupancy and cultivation of the acreage\r\nfor a period of not less than five years, and during that period the\r\npurchaser or grantee cannot alienate or encumber the land or the title\r\nthereto. Six consecutive months' absence from the land, during the\r\nabove period of five years, cancels the grant. The land granted under\r\nthis Act cannot be seized for debt contracted prior to the grant. Many\r\napplications have already been made for land under this Act.\r\n\r\n[267] \"No teacher or other person shall teach or criticize the doctrine\r\nof any Church, religious sect, or denomination, or shall attempt to\r\ninfluence the pupils for or against any Church or religious sect in\r\nany public school established under this Act. If any teacher shall\r\nintentionally violate this section, he or she shall, after due hearing,\r\nbe dismissed from the public service. _Provided, however_, that it\r\nshall be lawful for the priest, or minister of any church established\r\nin the town where a public school is situated ... to teach religion\r\nfor one half an hour three times a week in the school building to\r\nthose public school pupils whose parents or guardians desire it,\"\r\netc.--Section 16 of the Public School Act, No. 74.\r\n\r\n[268] Placido Louis Chapelle, Archbishop of New Orleans, was born\r\nin France in 1842, and, at the age of seventeen years, emigrated to\r\nAmerica, where he entered the priesthood. In 1894 he received the\r\nmitre of Santa Fe, and in 1897 that of New Orleans. In 1898 he was\r\nappointed Apostolic Delegate to Cuba, Porto Rico, and the Philippine\r\nIslands. His mission ended, he returned to New Orleans, where he died\r\nof yellow fever in August, 1905.\r\n\r\n[269] _Vide_ Senate Document No. 190, p. 62, 56th Congress, 2nd\r\nSession.\r\n\r\n[270] _Ibid_., p. 221.\r\n\r\n[271] At the outbreak of the Rebellion (1896) the total number of\r\nfriars of the four Orders of Dominicans, Agustinians, Recoletos,\r\nand Franciscans in these Islands was 1,105, of whom about 40 were\r\nkilled by the rebels. There were, moreover, 86 Jesuit priests, 81\r\nJesuit lay brothers and teachers, 10 Benedictines, and 49 Paulists;\r\nbut all these were outside the \"friar question.\"\r\n\r\n[272] _Vide_ Senate Document No. 190, p. 2, 56th Congress, 2nd Session.\r\n\r\n[273] Bernardino Nozaleda, a native of Asturias, Spain, of rustic\r\nparentage, was originally a professor in Manila, where he became\r\nArchbishop in 1889. In 1903 he was nominated for the archbishopric of\r\nValencia, Spain, but the citizens absolutely refused to receive him,\r\nbecause of evil report concerning him.\r\n\r\n[274] In May, 1904, Father Singson was appointed by His Holiness\r\nDomestic Prelate of the Pope, with the title of Monsignore.\r\n\r\n[275] Report of the Secretary of War for 1902, p. 234. Published\r\nin Washington.\r\n\r\n[276] I was in Italy during the whole of the negotiations. The Italian\r\nclerical press alluded to the outcome as a diplomatic victory for\r\nthe Vatican.\r\n\r\n[277] The Franciscan Order is not allowed by its rules to possess any\r\nproperty. It therefore had no agricultural lands, and no other property\r\nthan dwelling-houses for members, two convents, and two infirmaries.\r\n\r\n[278] _Vide_ Senate Document No. 112, p. 27, 56th Congress, 2nd\r\nSession; and Senate Document No. 331, p. 180 of Part I., 57th Congress,\r\n1st Session. Published by the Government Printing Office, Washington.\r\n\r\n[279] _Vide_ speech of Gov.-General (then styled Civil Governor)\r\nLuke E. Wright on assuming office on February 1, 1904. Reported in\r\nthe _Manila Official Gazette_, Vol. II., No. 5, dated February 3, 1904.\r\n\r\n[280] This condition was termed \"frailuno.\" In its application to the\r\nEuropean it simply denoted \"partisan of the regular clergy.\" Its\r\npopular signification when applied to the native was a total\r\nrelinquishment of, or incapacity for, independent appreciation of\r\nthe friars' dicta in mundane matters.\r\n\r\n[281] Since the Treaty of Paris (1898) the Spanish friars are\r\nforeigners in these Islands. The Philippine clergy oppose a foreign\r\nmonopoly of their Church. They declare themselves competent to\r\nundertake the cure of souls, and claim the fulfilment of the Council\r\nof Trent decrees which prohibit the regular clergy to hold benefices,\r\nexcept on two conditions, viz.:--(1) as missionaries to non-Christians,\r\n(2) as temporary parish priests in christian communities where\r\nqualified secular clergy cannot be found to take their places. The\r\ncrux of the whole question is the competency or incompetency of\r\nthe Philippine clergy. The Aglipayans allege that Pope Leo XIII.,\r\nin the last years of his pontificate, issued a bull declaring the\r\nFilipinos to be incompetent for the cure of souls. They strongly resent\r\nthis. Whether the bull exists or not, the unfitness of the Philippine\r\nclergy to take the place of the regular clergy was suggested by the\r\nHoly See in 1902 (_vide_ p. 599).\r\n\r\nThe Council of Trent was the 18th oecumenical council of the Church,\r\nassembled at Trent, a town in the Austrian Tyrol, and sat, with\r\ncertain interruptions, from December 13, 1545, until December 4,\r\n1563. Nearly every point of doubt or dispute within the Catholic\r\nChurch was discussed at this Council. Its decrees were confirmed and\r\npublished by Pope Pius IV. in 1564 by papal decree, being a brief\r\nsummary of the doctrines known as the Profession of the Tridentine\r\nFaith, commonly called also the Creed of Pius IV.\r\n\r\n[282] Monsignor Ambrogio Agius, born on September 17, 1856,\r\nof a distinguished Maltese family, entered on his novitiate at\r\nthe Benedictine Monastery of Ramsgate, England, on September 8,\r\n1871. Having finished his studies of philosophy and theology in Rome,\r\nhe was ordained as priest on October 16, 1881, in the Cathedral of\r\nSanto Scolastico at Subiaco. He then returned to England, but in\r\n1895 he was called to Rome, where for nine years he held several\r\necclesiastical offices. His ability was observed by Pope Leo XIII.,\r\nand by his successor Pius X., who raised Ambrogio Agius to the dignity\r\nof titular Archbishop of Palmyra and appointed him Apostolic Delegate\r\nto the Philippine Islands in the year 1904, in succession to the late\r\nMonsignor Giovanni Guidi.\r\n\r\n[283] The Census Report of 1903 shows the Civilized male population\r\ntwenty-one years of age and over to be as follows: of Superior\r\nEducation 50,140, Literate 489,609, and Illiterate 1,137,776.\r\n\r\n[284] _Vide Official Gazette_, Vol. II., No. 4, dated January 27, 1904.\r\n\r\n[285] Under the Act of Congress which authorized the taking of\r\nthe census, dated July 1, 1902. it is provided (Section (6) that a\r\nPhilippine Assembly shall be created two years after the publication of\r\nthe Census Report. This publication, complete in four volumes, having\r\nbeen issued on March 27, 1905, the following day the Gov.-General at\r\nManila notified by proclamation that \"in case a condition of general\r\nand complete peace, with recognition of the authority of the United\r\nStates, shall have continued in the territory of these Islands, not\r\ninhabited by Moros or non-christian tribes, and such facts shall have\r\nbeen certified to the President by the Philippine Commission, the\r\nPresident, upon being satisfied thereof, shall direct the Philippine\r\nCommission to call, and the Commission shall call, a general election\r\nfor the choice of delegates to a popular assembly of the people of\r\nthe said territory in the Philippine Islands, which shall be known as\r\nthe _Philippine Assembly_, and which provides also that after the said\r\nAssembly shall have been convened and organized, all the legislative\r\npower heretofore conferred on the Philippine Commission in that\r\npart of these Islands not inhabited by Moros or other non-christian\r\ntribes shall be vested in a Legislature consisting of two Houses--the\r\nPhilippine Commission and the Philippine Assembly. In witness whereof\r\n(etc., etc.) this 28th day of March, 1905.\"\r\n\r\n[286] At Baguio, in the mountain region of the Benguet district, at an\r\naltitude of about 5,000 feet, the Insular Government has established\r\na health-resort for the recreation of the members of the Civil\r\nCommission. The air is pure, and the temperature so low (max. 78 deg.,\r\nmin. 46 deg. Fahr.) that pine-forests exist in the neighbourhood, and\r\npotatoes (which are well known all over the Islands for many years\r\npast) are cultivated there. The distance from Manila to Baguio, in\r\na straight line, would be about 130 miles. By this route--that is\r\nto say, by railway to Dagupan, 120 miles, and then by the 55-mile\r\nroad (opened in the spring of 1905)--the travelling distance is 175\r\nmiles. The new road runs through a country half uninhabited, and leads\r\nto (commercially) nowhere. The amount originally appropriated for the\r\nmaking of this 55-mile road was $75,000 gold (Philippine Commission\r\nAct No. 61). Up to January, 1905, $2,400,000 gold had been expended\r\non its construction. It is curious to note that this sum includes\r\n$366,260 gold taken from the Congressional Relief Fund (_vide_\r\np. 621). A further appropriation of $17,500 gold has been made for its\r\nimprovement, with the prospect of large sums being yet needed for this\r\nundertaking, which is of no benefit whatever to the Filipinos. They\r\nneed no sanatorium, and Europeans have lived in the Islands, up to 30\r\nyears, without one. The word _Baguio_ in Tagalog signifies Hurricane.\r\n\r\n[287] _Vide_ \"Population of the Philippines,\" Bulletin 1, published by\r\nthe Department of Commerce and Labour.
