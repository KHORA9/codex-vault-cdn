Asturian and\r\nGalician both possess literatures which in their recent developments\r\nare artificial. Basque, the spoiled child of philologers, has not\r\nadded greatly to the sum of the world's delight; and even if it had,\r\nI should be incapable of undertaking a task which would belong of\r\nright to experts like Mr. Wentworth Webster, M. Jules Vinson, and\r\nProfessor Schuchardt. Catalan is so singularly rich and varied that\r\nit might well deserve separate treatment: its inclusion here would\r\nbe as unjustifiable as the inclusion of Provençal in a work dealing\r\nwith French literature. For the purposes of this book, minor varieties\r\nare neglected, and Spanish literature is taken as referring solely to\r\nCastilian—the speech of Juan Ruiz, Cervantes, Lope de Vega, Tirso de\r\nMolina, Quevedo, and Calderón.\r\n\r\nAt the close of the last century, Nicolas Masson de Morvilliers\r\nraised a hubbub by asking two questions in the _Encyclopédie\r\nMéthodique_:—\"Mais que doit-on à l'Espagne? Et depuis deux siècles,\r\ndepuis quatre, depuis six, qu'a-t elle fait pour l'Europe?\" I have\r\nattempted an answer in this volume. The introductory chapter has\r\nbeen written to remind readers that the great figures of the Silver\r\nAge—Seneca, Lucan, Martial, Quintilian—were Spaniards as well as\r\nRomans. It further aims at tracing the stream of literature from its\r\nRoman fount to the channels of the Gothic period; at defining the\r\nlimits of Arabic and Hebrew influence on Spanish letters; at refuting\r\nthe theory which assumes the existence of immemorial _romances_, and\r\nat explaining the interaction between Spanish on the one side and\r\nProvençal and French on the other. It has been thought that this\r\ntreatment saves much digression.\r\n\r\nSpanish literature, like our own, takes its root in French and in\r\nItalian soil; in the anonymous epics, in the _fableaux_, as in Dante,\r\nPetrarch, and the Cinque Cento poets. Excessive patriotism leads men\r\nof all lands to magnify their literary history; yet it may be claimed\r\nfor Spain, as for England, that she has used her models without\r\ncompromising her originality, absorbing here, annexing there, and\r\nfinally dominating her first masters. But Spain's victorious course,\r\nsplendid as it was in letters, arts, and arms, was comparatively brief.\r\nThe heroic age of her literature extends over some hundred and fifty\r\nyears, from the accession of Carlos Quinto to the death of Felipe IV.\r\nThis period has been treated, as it deserves, at greater length than\r\nany other. The need of compression, confronting me at every page,\r\nhas compelled the omission of many writers. I can only plead that\r\nI have used my discretion impartially, and I trust that no really\r\nrepresentative figure will be found missing.\r\n\r\nMy debts to predecessors will be gathered from the bibliographical\r\nappendix. I owe a very special acknowledgment to my friend Sr. D.\r\nMarcelino Menéndez y Pelayo, the most eminent of Spanish scholars and\r\ncritics. If I have sometimes dissented from him, I have done so with\r\nmuch hesitation, believing that any independent view is better than the\r\nmechanical repetition of authoritative verdicts. I have to thank Mr.\r\nGosse for the great care with which he has read the proofs; and to Mr.\r\nHenley, whose interest in all that touches Spain is of long standing, I\r\nam indebted for much suggestive criticism. For advice on some points of\r\ndetail, I am obliged to Sr. D. Ramón Menéndez Pidal, to Sr. D. Adolfo\r\nBonilla y San Martín, and to Sr. D. Rafael Altamira y Crevea.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                               CONTENTS\r\n\r\n\r\n  CHAPTER                                               PAGE\r\n\r\n  I.

As with men of Spanish stock, so\r\nwith their letters: the national idiosyncrasy is emphatic—almost\r\nviolent. French literature is certainly more exquisite, more brilliant;\r\nEnglish is loftier and more varied; but in the capital qualities of\r\noriginality, force, truth, and humour, the Castilian finds no superior.\r\nThe Basques, who have survived innumerable onsets (among them, the\r\nridicule of Rabelais and the irony of Cervantes), are held by some\r\nto be representatives of the Stone-age folk who peopled the east,\r\nnorth-east, and south of Spain. This notion is based mainly upon the\r\nfact that all true Basque names for cutting instruments are derived\r\nfrom the word _aitz_ (flint). Howbeit, the Basques vaunt no literary\r\nhistory in the true sense. The _Leloaren Cantua_ (_Song of Lelo_) has\r\nbeen accepted as a contemporary hymn written in celebration of a\r\nBasque triumph over Augustus. Its date is uncertain, and its refrain\r\nof \"_Lelo_\" seems a distorted reminiscence of the Arabic catchword _Lā\r\nilāh illā 'llāh_; but the _Leloaren Cantua_ is assuredly no older than\r\nthe sixteenth century.\r\n\r\nA second performance in this sort is the _Altobiskarko Cantua_ (_Song\r\nof Altobiskar_). Altobiskar is a hill near Roncesvalles, where\r\nthe Basques are said to have defeated Charlemagne; and the song\r\ncommemorates the victory. Written in a rhythm without fellow in the\r\nBasque metres, it contains names like Roland and Ganelon, which are in\r\nthemselves proofs of French origin; but, as it has been widely received\r\nas genuine, the facts concerning it must be told. First written in\r\nFrench (_circa_ 1833) by François Eugène Garay de Monglave, it was\r\ntranslated into very indifferent Basque by a native of Espelette named\r\nLouis Duhalde, then a student in Paris. The too-renowned _Altobiskarko\r\nCantua_ is therefore a simple hoax: one might as well attribute\r\n_Rule Britannia_ to Boadicea. The conquerors of Roncesvalles wrote\r\nno triumphing song: three centuries later the losers immortalised\r\ntheir own overthrow in the _Chanson de Roland_, where the disaster is\r\ncredited to the Arabs, and the Basques are merely mentioned by the way.\r\nEarly in the twelfth century there was written a Latin _Chronicle_\r\nascribed to Archbishop Turpin, an historical personage who ruled the\r\nsee of Rheims some two hundred years before his false _Chronicle_ was\r\nwritten. The opening chapters of this fictitious history are probably\r\ndue to an anonymous Spanish monk cloistered at Santiago de Compostela;\r\nand it is barely possible that this late source was utilised by such\r\nmodern Basques as José María Goizcueta, who retouched and \"restored\"\r\nthe _Altobiskarko Cantua_ in ignorant good faith.\r\n\r\nHowever that may prove, no existing Basque song is much more than three\r\nhundred years old. One single Basque of genius, the Chancellor Pero\r\nLópez de Ayala, shines a portent in the literature of the fourteenth\r\ncentury; and even so, he writes in Castilian. He stands alone, isolated\r\nfrom his race. The oldest Basque book, well named as _Linguæ Vasconum\r\nPrimitiæ_, is a collection of exceedingly minor verse by Bernard\r\nDechepare, curé of Saint-Michel, near Saint-Jean Pied de Port; and\r\nits date is modern (1545). Pedro de Axular is the first Basque who\r\nshows any originality in his native tongue; and, characteristically\r\nenough, he deals with religious matters. Though he lived at Sare, in\r\nthe Basses Pyrénées, he was a Spaniard from Navarre; and he flourished\r\nin the seventeenth century (1643). It is true that a small knot of\r\nsecond-class Basque—the epic poet Ercilla y Zúñiga, and the fabulist\r\nIriarte—figure in Castilian literature; but the Basque glories are\r\nto be sought in other field—in such heroic personages as Ignacio\r\nLoyola, and his mightier disciple Francisco Xavier. Setting aside\r\ndevotional and didactic works, mostly translated from other tongues,\r\nBasque literature is chiefly oral, and has but a formal connection\r\nwith the history of Spanish letters. Within narrow geographical\r\nlimits the Basque language still thrives, and on each slope of the\r\nPyrenees holds its own against forces apparently irresistible. But\r\nits vitality exceeds its reproductive force: it survives but does not\r\nmultiply. Whatever the former influence of Basque on Castilian—an\r\ninfluence never great—it has now ceased; while Castilian daily tends\r\nto supplant (or, at least, to supplement) Basque. Spain's later\r\ninvaders—Iberians, Kelts, Phœnicians, Greeks, Carthaginians, Alani,\r\nSuevi, Goths, and Arabs—have left but paltry traces on the prevailing\r\nform of Spanish speech, which derives from Latin by a descent more\r\nobvious, though not a whit more direct, than the descent of French.\r\nSo frail is the partition which divides the Latin mother from her\r\nnoblest daughter, that late in the sixteenth century Fernando Pérez\r\nde Oliva wrote a treatise that was at once Latin and Spanish: a thing\r\nintelligible in either tongue and futile in both, though held for\r\npraiseworthy in an age when the best poets chose to string lines into a\r\npolyglot rosary, without any distinction save that of antic dexterity.\r\n\r\nFor our purpose, the dawn of literature in Spain begins with the\r\nRoman conquest. In colonies like Pax Augusta (Badajoz), Cæsar Augusta\r\n(Zaragoza), and Emerita Augusta (Mérida), the Roman influence was\r\nstrengthened by the intermarriage of Roman soldiers with Spanish women.\r\nAll over Spain there arose the _odiosa cantio_, as St. Augustine calls\r\nit, of Spanish children learning Latin; and every school formed a fresh\r\ncentre of Latin authority. With their laws, the conquerors imposed\r\ntheir speech upon the broken tribes; and these, in turn, invaded\r\nthe capital of Latin politics and letters. The breath of Spanish\r\ngenius informs the Latinity of the Silver Age. Augustus himself had\r\nnamed his Spanish freedman, Gaius Julius Hyginus, the Chief Keeper\r\nof the Palatine Library. Spanish literary aptitude, showing stronger\r\nin the prodigious learning of the Elder Seneca, matures in the\r\naltisonant rhetoric and violent colouring of the Younger, in Lucan's\r\ndeclamatory eloquence and metallic music, in Martial's unblushing\r\nhumour and brutal cynicism, in Quintilian's luminous judgment and wise\r\nsententiousness.\r\n\r\nAll these display in germ the characteristic points of strength and\r\nweakness which were to be developed in the evolution of Spanish\r\nliterature; and their influence on letters was matched by their\r\ncountrymen's authority on affairs. The Spaniard Balbus was the first\r\nbarbarian to reach the Consulship, and to receive the honour of a\r\npublic triumph; the Spaniard Trajan was the first barbarian named\r\nEmperor, the first Emperor to make the Tigris the eastern boundary of\r\nhis dominion, and the only Emperor whose ashes were allowed to rest\r\nwithin the Roman city-walls. And the victory of the vanquished was\r\ncomplete when the Spaniard Hadrian, the author of the famous verses—\r\n\r\n  \"_Animula vagula blandula,\r\n  Hospes comesque corporis,\r\n  Quæ nunc abibis in loca,\r\n  Pallidula rigida nudula,\r\n  Nec, ut soles, dabis jocos?_\"—\r\n\r\nhimself an exquisite in art and in letters—became the master of\r\nthe world. Gibbon declares with justice that the happiest epoch in\r\nmankind's history is \"that which elapsed from the death of Domitian\r\nto the accession of Commodus\"; and the Spaniard, accounting Marcus\r\nAurelius as a son of Córdoba, vaunts with reasonable pride, that of\r\nthose eighty perfect, golden years, three-score at least were passed\r\nbeneath the sceptre of the Spanish Cæsars.\r\n\r\nWithal, individual success apart, the Spanish utterance of Latin teased\r\nthe finer ear. Cicero ridiculed the accent—_aliquid pingue_—of\r\neven the more lettered Spaniards who reached Rome; Martial, retired\r\nto his native Bilbilis, shuddered lest he might let fall a local\r\nidiom; and Quintilian, a sterner purist than a very Roman, frowned at\r\nthe intrusion of his native provincialisms upon the everyday talk of\r\nthe capital. In Rome incorrections of speech were found where least\r\nexpected. That Catullus should jeer at Arrius—the forerunner of a\r\nLondon type—in the matter of aspirates is natural enough; but even\r\nAugustus distressed the nice grammarian. _A fortiori_, Hadrian was\r\ntaunted with his Spanish solecisms. Innovation won the day. The century\r\nbetween Livy and Tacitus shows differences of style inexplicable by the\r\neasy theory of varieties of temperament; and the two centuries dividing\r\nTacitus from St. Augustine are marked by changes still more striking.\r\nThis is but another illustration of the old maxim, that as the speed of\r\nfalling bodies increases with distance, so literary decadences increase\r\nwith time.\r\n\r\nAs in Italy and Africa, so in Spain. The statelier _sermo urbanus_\r\nyielded to the _sermo plebeius_. Spanish soldiers had discovered\r\n\"the fatal secret of empire, that emperors could be made elsewhere\r\nthan at Rome\"; no less fatal was the discovery that Latin might be\r\nspoken without regard for Roman models. As the power of classic forms\r\nwaned, that of ecclesiastical examples grew. Church Latin of the\r\nfourth century shines at its best in the verse of the Christian poet,\r\nthe Spaniard Prudentius: with him the classical rhythms persist—as\r\nsurvivals. He clutches at, rather than grasps, the Roman verse\r\ntradition, and, though he has no rhyming stanzas, he verges on rhyme\r\nin such performances as his _Hymnus ad Galli Cantum_. Throughout the\r\nnoblest period of Roman poetry, soldiers, sailors, and illiterates\r\nhad, in the _versus saturnius_, preserved a native rhythmical system\r\nnot quantitative but accentual; and this vulgar metrical method was to\r\noutlive its fashionable rival. It is doubtful whether the quantitative\r\nprosody, brought from Greece by literary dandies, ever flourished\r\nwithout the circle of professional men of letters. It is indisputable\r\nthat the imported metrical rules, depending on the power of vowels and\r\nthe position of consonants, were gradually superseded by looser laws of\r\nsyllabic quantity wherein accent and tonic stress were the main factors.\r\n\r\nWhen the empire fell, Spain became the easy prey of northern\r\nbarbarians, who held the country by the sword, and intermarried but\r\nlittle with its people. To the Goths Spain owes nothing but eclipse\r\nand ruin. No books, no inscriptions of Gothic origin survive; the\r\nGongoristic letters ascribed to King Sisebut are not his work, and\r\nit is doubtful if the Goths bequeathed more than a few words to the\r\nSpanish vocabulary. The defeat of Roderic by Tarik and Mūsa laid Spain\r\nopen to the Arab rush. National sentiment was unborn. Witiza and\r\nRoderic were regarded by Spaniards as men in Italy and Africa regarded\r\nTotila and Galimar. The clergy were alienated from their Gothic rulers.\r\nGothic favourites were appointed to non-existent dioceses carrying huge\r\nrevenues; a single Goth held two sees simultaneously; and, by way of\r\nbalance, Toledo was misgoverned by two rival Gothic bishops. Harassed\r\nby a severe penal code, the Jew hailed the invading Arabs as a kindred,\r\noriental, circumcised race; and, with the heathen slaves, they went\r\nover to the conquerors. So obscure is the history of the ensuing years\r\nthat it has been said that the one thing certain is Roderic's name.\r\nNot less certain is it that, within a brief space, almost the entire\r\npeninsula was subdued. The more warlike Spaniards,\r\n\r\n  \"_Patient of toil, serene among alarms,\r\n  Inflexible in faith, invincible in arms,_\"\r\n\r\nforegathered with Pelayo by the Cave of Covadonga, near Oviedo, among\r\nthe Pyrenean chines, which they held against the forces of the Berber\r\nAlkamah and the renegade Archbishop, Don Opas. \"Confident in the\r\nstrength of their mountains,\" says Gibbon, these highlanders \"were the\r\nlast who submitted to the arms of Rome, and the first who threw off\r\nthe yoke of the Arabs.\" While on the Asturian hillsides the spirit of\r\nSpanish nationality was thus nurtured amid convulsions, the less hardy\r\ninhabitants of the south accepted their defeat. The few who embraced\r\nIslamism were despised as Muladíes; the many, adopting all save the\r\nreligion of their masters, were called Muzárabes, just as, during the\r\nmarch of the reconquest, Moors similarly placed in Christian provinces\r\nwere dubbed Mudéjares.\r\n\r\nThe literary traditions of Seneca, Lucan, and their brethren, passed\r\nthrough the hands of mediocrities like Pomponius Mela and Columella,\r\nto be delivered to Gaius Vettius Aquilinus Juvencus, who gave a\r\nrendering of the gospels, wherein the Virgilian hexameter is aped with\r\na certain provincial vigour. Minor poets, not lacking in marmoreal\r\ngrace, survive in Baron Hübner's _Corpus Inscriptionum Latinorum_.\r\nAmong the breed of learned churchmen shines the name of St. Damasus,\r\nfirst of Spanish popes, who shows all his race's zeal in heresy-hunting\r\nand in fostering monkery. The saponaceous eloquence that earned him\r\nthe name of _Auriscalpius matronarum_ (\"the Ladies' Ear-tickler\") is\r\nforgotten; but he deserves remembrance because of his achievement\r\nas an epigraphist, and because he moved his friend, St. Jerome, to\r\ntranslate the Bible. To him succeeds Hosius of Córdoba, the mentor of\r\nConstantine, the champion of Athanasian orthodoxy, and the presiding\r\nbishop at the Council of Nicæa, to whom is attributed the incorporation\r\nin the Nicene Creed of that momentous clause, \"_Genitum non factum,\r\nconsubstantialem Patri_.\"\r\n\r\nPrudentius follows next, with that savour of the terrible and agonising\r\nwhich marks the Spagnoletto school of art; but to all his strength\r\nand sternness he adds a sweeter, tenderer tone. At once a Christian,\r\na Spaniard, and a Roman, to Prudentius his birthplace is ever _felix\r\nTarraco_ (he came from Tarragona); and he thrills with pride when he\r\nboasts that Cæsar Augusta gave his Mother-Church most martyrs. Yet,\r\nChristian though he be, the imperial spirit in him fires at the thought\r\nof the multitudinous tribes welded into a single people, and he plainly\r\ntells you that a Roman citizen is as far above the brute barbarian as\r\nman is above beast. Priscillian and his fellow-sufferer Latrocinius,\r\nthe first martyrs slain by Christianity set in office, were both clerks\r\nof singular accomplishment. As disciple of St. Augustine, and comrade\r\nof St. Jerome, Orosius would be remembered, even were he not the\r\nearliest historian of the world. Like Prudentius, Orosius blends the\r\npassion of universal empire with the fervour of local sentiment. Good,\r\nhaughty Spaniard as he is, he enregisters the battles that his fathers\r\ngave for freedom; he ranks Numancia's name only below that of the\r\nworld-mother, Rome; and his heart softens towards the blind barbarians,\r\ntheir faces turned towards the light. Cold, austere, and even a trifle\r\ncynical as he is, Orosius' pulses throb at memory of Cæsar; and he\r\nglows on thinking that, a citizen of no mean city, he ranges the world\r\nunder Roman jurisdiction. And this vast union of diverse races, all\r\nspeaking one single tongue, all recognising one universal law, Orosius\r\ncalls by the new name of Romania.\r\n\r\nLicinianus follows, the Bishop of Cartagena and the correspondent\r\nof St. Gregory the Great. A prouder and more illustrious figure is\r\nthat of St. Isidore of Seville—\"_beatus et lumen noster Isidorus_.\"\r\nOriginality is not Isidore's distinction, and the Latin verses which\r\npass under his name are of doubtful authenticity. But his encyclopædic\r\nlearning is amazing, and gives him place beside Cassiodorus, Boëtius,\r\nand Martianus Capella, among the greatest teachers of the West. St.\r\nBraulius, Bishop of Zaragoza, lives as the editor of his master\r\nIsidore's posthumous writings, and as the author of a hymn to that\r\nnational saint, Millán. Nor should we omit the names of St. Eugenius,\r\na realist versifier of the day, and of St. Valerius, who had all the\r\npoetic gifts save the accomplishment of verse. Naturalised foreigners,\r\nlike the Hungarian St. Martin of Dumi, Archbishop of Braga, lent\r\nlustre to Spain at home. Spaniards, like Claude, Bishop of Turin and\r\nlike Prudentius Galindus, Bishop of Troyes, carried the national fame\r\nabroad: the first in writings which prove the permanence of Seneca's\r\ntradition, the second in polemics against the pantheists. More rarely\r\ndowered was Theodolphus, the Spanish Bishop of Orleans, distinguished\r\nat Charlemagne's court as a man of letters and a poet; nor is it likely\r\nthat Theodolphus' name can ever be forgotten, for his exultant hymn,\r\n_Gloria, laus, et honor_, is sung the world over on Palm Sunday. And\r\nscarcely less notable are the composers of the noble Latin-Gothic\r\nhymnal, the makers of the _Breviarum Gothicum_ of Lorenzana and of\r\nArévalo's _Hymnodia Hispanica_.\r\n\r\nEnough has been said to show that, amid the tumult of Gothic supremacy\r\nin Spain, literature was pursued—though not by Goths—with results\r\nwhich, if not splendid, are at least unmatched in other Western lands.\r\nDoubtless in Spain, as elsewhere, much curious learning and insolent\r\nignorance throve jowl by jowl. Like enough, some Spanish St. Ouen\r\nwrote down Homer, Menander, and Virgil as three plain blackguards;\r\nlike enough, the Spanish biographer of some local St. Bavo confounded\r\nTityrus with Virgil, and declared that Pisistratus' Athenian\r\ncontemporaries spoke habitually in Latin. The conceit of ignorance is\r\na thing eternal. Withal, from the age of Prudentius onward, literature\r\nwas sustained in one or other shape. For a century after Tarik's\r\nlanding there is a pause, unbroken save for the _Chronicle_ of the\r\nanonymous Córdoban, too rashly identified as Isidore Pacensis. The\r\nintellectual revival appears, not among the Arabs, but among the Jews\r\nof Córdoba and Toledo; this last the immemorial home of magic where\r\nthe devil was reputed to catch his own shadow. It was a devout belief\r\nthat clerks went to Paris to study \"the liberal arts,\" whereas in\r\nToledo they mastered demonology and forgot their morals. Córdoba's\r\nfame, as the world's fine flower, crossed the German Rhine, and\r\neven reached the cloister of Roswitha, a nun who dabbled in Latin\r\ncomedies. The achievements of Spanish Jews and Spanish Arabs call\r\nfor separate treatises. Here it must suffice to say that the roll\r\ncontains names mighty as that of the Jewish poet and philosopher Ibn\r\nGebirol or Avicebron (d. ? 1070), whom Duns Scotus acknowledges as his\r\nmaster; and that of Judah ben Samuel the Levite (b. 1086), whom Heine\r\ncelebrates in the _Romanzero_:\r\n\r\n  \"_Rein und wahrhaft, sonder Makel\r\n  War sein Lied, wie seine Seele._\"\r\n\r\nIn one sense, if we choose to fasten on his favourite trick of closing\r\na Hebrew stanza with a romance line, Judah ben Samuel the Levite may\r\nbe accounted the earliest of known experimentalists in Spanish verse;\r\nand an Arab poet of Spanish descent, Ibn Hazm, anticipated the Catalan,\r\nAuzías March, by founding a school of poetry, at once mystic and\r\namorous.\r\n\r\nBut the Spanish Jews and Spanish Arabs gained their chief distinction\r\nin philosophy. Of these are Ibn Bājjah or Avempace (d. 1138), the\r\nopponent of al-Gazāli and his mystico-sceptical method; and Abū Bakr\r\nibn al-Tufail (1116-85), the author of a neo-platonic, pantheistic\r\nromance entitled _Risālat Haiy ibn Yakzān_, of which the main thesis\r\nis that religious and philosophic truth are but two forms of the same\r\nthing. Muhammad ibn Ahmad ibn Rushd (1126-98), best known as Averroes,\r\ntaught the doctrine of the universal nature and unity of the human\r\nintellect, accounting for individual inequalities by a fantastic\r\ntheory of stages of illumination. Arab though he was, Averroes was\r\nmore reverenced by Jews than by men of his own race; and his permanent\r\nvogue is proved by the fact that Columbus cites him three centuries\r\nafterwards, while his teachings prevailed in the University of Padua\r\nas late as Luther's time. A more august name is that of \"the Spanish\r\nAristotle,\" Moses ben Maimon or Maimonides (1135-1204), the greatest\r\nof European Jews, the intellectual father, so to say, of Albertus\r\nMagnus and St. Thomas of Aquin. Born at Córdoba, Maimonides drifted\r\nto Cairo, where he became chief rabbi of the synagogue, and served as\r\nSaladin's physician, having refused a like post in the household of\r\nRichard the Lion-hearted. It is doubtful if Maimonides was a Jew at\r\nheart; it is unquestioned that at one time he conformed outwardly to\r\nMuhammadanism. A stinging epigram summarises his achievement by saying\r\nthat he philosophised the Talmud and talmudised philosophy. It is, of\r\ncourse, absurd to suppose that his critical faculty could accept the\r\nchildish legends of the _Haggadah_, wherein rabbis manifold report that\r\nthe lion fears the cock's crow, that the salamander quenches fire, and\r\nother incredible puerilities. In his _Yad ha-Hazakah_ (The Strong Hand)\r\nMaimonides seeks to purge the Talmud of its _pilpulim_ or casuistic\r\ncommentaries, and to make the book a sufficient guide for practical\r\nlife rather than to leave it a dust-heap for intellectual scavengers.\r\nHence he tends to a rationalistic interpretation of Scriptural records.\r\nDirect communion with the Deity, miracles, prophetic gifts, are not\r\nso much denied as explained away by means of a symbolic exegesis,\r\ninfinitely subtle and imaginative. Spanish and African rabbis received\r\nthe new teaching with docility, and in his own lifetime Maimonides'\r\nsuccess was absolute. A certain section of his followers carried\r\nthe cautious rationalism of the master to extremities, and thus\r\nproduced the inevitable reaction of the _Kabbala_ with its apparatus\r\nof elaborate extravagances. This reaction was headed by another\r\nSpaniard, the Catalan mystic, Bonastruc de Portas or Moses ben Nahman\r\n(1195-1270); and the relation of the two leaders is exemplified by\r\nthe rabbinical legend which tells that the soul of each sprang from\r\nAdam's head: Maimonides, from the left curl, which typifies severity of\r\njudgment; Moses ben Nahman from the right, which symbolises tenderness\r\nand mercy.\r\n\r\nOn literature the pretended \"Arab influence,\" if it exist at all, is\r\nnowise comparable to that of the Spanish Jews, who can boast that\r\nJudah ben Samuel the Levite lives as one of Dante's masters. Judah\r\nranks among the great immortals of the world, and no Arab is fit\r\nto loosen the thong of his sandal. But it might very well befall a\r\nsecond-rate man, favoured by fortune and occasion, to head a literary\r\nrevolution. It was not the case in Spain. The innumerable Spanish-Arab\r\npoets, vulgarised by the industry of Schack and interpreted by the\r\ngenius of Valera, are not merely incomprehensible to us here and now;\r\nthey were enigmas to most contemporary Arabs, who were necessarily\r\nignorant of what was, to all purposes, a dead language—the elaborate\r\ntechnical vocabulary of Arabic verse. If their own countrymen failed\r\nto understand these poets, it would be surprising had their stilted\r\nartifice filtered into Castilian. It is unscientific, and almost\r\nunreasonable, to assume that what baffles the greatest Arabists of\r\nto-day was plain to a wandering mummer a thousand, or even six hundred,\r\nyears ago. There is, however, a widespread belief that the metrical\r\nform of the Castilian _romance_ (a simple lyrico-narrative poem in\r\noctosyllabic assonants) derives from Arabic models. This theory is as\r\nuntenable as that which attributed Provençal rhythms to Arab singers.\r\nNo less erroneous is the idea that the entire assonantic system is an\r\nArab invention. Not only are assonants common to all Romance languages;\r\nthey exist in Latin hymns composed centuries before Muhammad's birth,\r\nand therefore long before any Arab reached Europe. It is significant\r\nthat no Arabist believes the legend of the \"Arab influence\"; for\r\nArabists are not more given than other specialists to belittling the\r\nimportance of their subject.\r\n\r\nIn sober truth, this Arab myth is but a bad dream of yesterday, a\r\nnightmare following upon an undigested perusal of the _Thousand and One\r\nNights_. Thanks to Galland, Cardonne, and Herbelot, the notion became\r\ngeneral that the Arabs were the great creative force of fiction. To\r\nfather Spanish _romances_ and Provençal _trobas_ upon them is a mere\r\nfreak of fancy. The tacit basis of this theory is that the Spaniards\r\ntook a rare interest in the intellectual side of Arab life; but the\r\nassumption is not justified by evidence. Save in a casual passage,\r\nas that in the _Crónica General_ on the capture of Valencia, the\r\nCastilian historians steadily ignore their Arab rivals. On the other\r\nhand, there is a class of _romances fronterizos_ (border ballads),\r\nsuch as that on the loss of Alhama, which is based on Arabic legends;\r\nand at least one such ballad, that of Abenamar, may be the work of a\r\nSpanish-speaking Moor. But these are isolated cases, are exceptional\r\nsolely as regards the source of the subject, and nowise differ in form\r\nfrom the two thousand other ballads of the _Romanceros_. To find a case\r\nof real imitation we must pass to the fifteenth century, when that\r\nlearned lyrist, the Marqués de Santillana, deliberately experiments in\r\nthe measures of an Arab _zajal_, a performance matched by a surviving\r\nfragment due to an anonymous poet in the _Cancionero de Linares_. These\r\nare metrical audacities, resembling the revival of French _ballades_\r\nand _rondeaux_ by artificers like Mr. Dobson, Mr. Gosse, and Mr. Henley\r\nin our own day. On the strength of two unique modern examples in the\r\nhistory of Castilian verse, it would be unjustifiable to believe, in\r\nthe teeth of all other evidence, that simple strollers intuitively\r\nassimilated rhythms whose intricacy bewilders the best experts. This\r\nis not to say that Arabic popular poetry had no influence on such\r\npopular Spanish verse as the _coplas_, of which some are apparently but\r\ntranslations of Arabic songs. That is an entirely different thesis; for\r\nwe are concerned here with literature to which the halting _coplas_ can\r\nscarcely be said to belong.\r\n\r\nThe \"Arab influence\" is to be sought elsewhere—in the diffusion of\r\nthe Eastern apologue, morality, or maxim, deriving from the Sanskrit.\r\nM. Bédier argues with extraordinary force, ingenuity, and learning,\r\nagainst the universal Eastern descent of the French _fabliaux_.\r\nHowever that be, the immediate Arabic origin of such a collection as\r\nthe _Disciplina Clericalis_ of Petrus Alfonsus (printed, in part,\r\nas the _Fables of Alfonce_, by Caxton, 1483, in _The Book of the\r\nsubtyl Historyes and Fables of Esope_), is as undoubted as the source\r\nof the apologue grafted on Castilian by Don Juan Manuel, or as the\r\nderivation of the maxims of Rabbi Sem Tom of Carrión. To this extent,\r\nin common with the rest of Europe, Spain owes the Arabs a debt which\r\nher picaresque novels and comedies have more than paid; but here again\r\nthe Arab acts as a mere middleman, taking the story of _Kalilah and\r\nDimna_ from the Sanskrit through the Pehlevī version, and then passing\r\nit by way of Spain to the rest of the Continent. Nor should it be\r\noverlooked that Spaniards, disguised as Arabs, shared in the work of\r\ninterpretation.\r\n\r\nIt is less easy to determine the extent to which colloquial Arabic\r\nwas used in Spain. Patriots would persuade you that the Arabs brought\r\nnothing to the stock of general culture, and the more thoroughgoing\r\ninsist that the Spaniards lent more than they borrowed. But the point\r\nmay be pressed too far. It must be admitted that Arabic had a vogue,\r\nthough perhaps not a vogue as wide as might be gathered from the\r\ntestimony of Paulus Alvarus Cordubiensis, whose _Indiculus Luminosus_,\r\na work of the ninth century, taunts the writer's countrymen with\r\nneglecting their ancient tongue for Hebrew and Arabic technicalities.\r\nThe ethnic influence of the Arabs is still obvious in Granada and other\r\nsouthern towns; and intermarriages, tending to strengthen the sway of\r\nthe victor's speech, were common from the outset, when Roderic's widow,\r\nEgilona, wedded Abd al-Aziz, son of Musa, her dead husband's conqueror.\r\nAn Alfonso of León espoused the daughter of Abd Allah, Emir of Toledo;\r\nand an Alfonso of Castile took to wife the daughter of an Emir of\r\nSeville. \"The wedding, which displeased God,\" of Alfonso the Fifth's\r\nsister with an Arab (some say with al-Mansūr), is sung in a famous\r\n_romance_ inspired by the _Crónica General_.\r\n\r\nIn official charters, as early as 804, Arabic words find place. A local\r\ndisuse of Latin is proved by the fact that in this ninth century the\r\nBishop of Seville found it needful to render the Bible into Arabic for\r\nthe use of Muzárabes; and still stronger evidence of the low estate of\r\nLatin is afforded by an Arabic version of canonical decrees. It follows\r\nthat some among the very clergy read Arabic more easily than they read\r\nLatin. Jewish poets, like Avicebron and Judah ben Samuel the Levite,\r\nsometimes composed in Arabic rather than in their native Hebrew; and it\r\nis almost certain that the lays of the Arab _rāwis_ radically modified\r\nthe structure of Hebrew verse. Apart from the evidence of Paulus\r\nAlvarus Cordubiensis, St. Eulogius deposes that certain Christians—he\r\nmentions Isaac the Martyr by name—spoke Arabic to perfection. Nor can\r\nit be pleaded that this zeal was invariably due to official pressure:\r\non the contrary, a caliph went the length of forbidding Spanish Jews\r\nand Christians to learn Arabic. Neither did the fashion die soon:\r\nlong after the Arab predominance was shaken, Arabic was the modish\r\ntongue. Álvar Fáñez, the Cid's right hand, is detected signing his\r\nname in Arabic characters. The Christian _dīnār_, Arabic in form and\r\nsuperscription, was invented to combat the Almoravide _dīnār_, which\r\nrivalled the popularity of the Constantinople besant; and as late as\r\nthe thirteenth century Spanish coins were struck with Arabic symbols on\r\nthe reverse side.\r\n\r\nYet, even so, the rude Latin of the unconquered north remained\r\nwell-nigh intact. Save in isolated centres, it was spoken by countless\r\nChristians and by the Spaniards who had escaped to the African province\r\nof Tingitana. Vast deduction must be made from the jeremiads of Paulus\r\nAlvarus Cordubiensis. As he bewails the time wasted on Hebrew and\r\nArabic by Spaniards, so does Avicebron lament the use of Arabic and\r\nRomance by Jews. \"One party speaks Idumean (Romance), the other the\r\ntongue of Kedar (Arabic).\" If the Arab flood ran high, the ebb was no\r\nless strong. Arabs tended more and more to ape the dress, the arms,\r\nthe customs of the Spaniards; and the Castilian-speaking Arab—the\r\n_moro latinado_—multiplied prodigiously. No small proportion of Arab\r\nwriters—Ibn Hazm, for example—was made up of sons or grandsons\r\nof Spaniards, not unacquainted with their fathers' speech. When\r\nArchbishop Raimundo founded his College of Translators at Toledo, where\r\nDominicus Gundisalvi collaborated with the convert Abraham ben David\r\n(Johannes Hispalensis), it might have seemed that the preservation\r\nof Arabic and Hebrew was secure. There and then, there could not\r\nhave occurred such a blunder as that immortal one of the Capuchin,\r\nHenricus Seynensis, who lives eternal by mistaking the _Talmud_—\"Rabbi\r\nTalmud\"—for a man. But no Arab work endures. And as with Arab\r\nphilosophy in Spain, so with the Arabic language: its soul was required\r\nof it. Hebrew, indeed, was not forgotten; and for Arabic, a revival\r\nmight be expected during the Crusades. Yet in all Europe, outside\r\nSpain, but three isolated Arabists of that time are known—William of\r\nTyre, Philip of Tripoli, and Adelard of Bath; and in Spain itself,\r\nwhen Boabdil surrendered in 1492, the tide had run so low that not a\r\nthousand Arabs in Granada could speak their native tongue. Nearly two\r\ncenturies before (in 1311-12) a council under Pope Clement V. advised\r\nthe establishment of Arabic chairs in the universities of Salamanca,\r\nBologna, Paris, and Oxford. Save at Bologna, the counsel was ignored;\r\nand in Spain, where it had once swaggered with airs official, Arabic\r\nalmost perished out of use.\r\n\r\nSave a group of technical words, the sole literary legacy bequeathed\r\nto Spain by the Arabs was their alphabet. This they used in writing\r\nCastilian, calling their transcription _aljamía_ (_ajami_ = foreign),\r\nwhich was the original name of the broken Latin spoken by the\r\nMuzárabes. First introduced in legal documents, the practice was\r\nprudently continued during the reconquest, and, besides its secrecy,\r\nwas further recommended by the fact that a special sanctity attaches\r\nto Arabic characters. But the peculiarity of _aljamía_ is that it\r\nbegot a literature of its own, though, naturally enough, a literature\r\nmodelled on the Spanish. Its best production is the _Poema de Yusuf_;\r\nand it may be noted that this, like its much later fellow, _La Alabanza\r\nde Mahoma_ (The Praise of Muhammad), is in the metre of the old Spanish\r\n\"clerkly poems\" (_poesías de clerecía_). So also the Aragonese Morisco,\r\nMuhammad Rabadán, writes his cyclic poem in Spanish octosyllabics; and\r\nin his successors there are hendecasyllabics manifestly imitated from\r\na characteristic Galician measure (_de gaita gallega_). The subjects\r\nof the _textos aljamiados_ are frankly conveyed from Western sources:\r\nthe _Compilation of Alexander_, an orientalised version of the French;\r\nthe _History of the Loves of Paris and Viana_, a translation from\r\nthe Provençal; and the _Maid of Arcayona_, based on the Spanish poem\r\n_Apolonio_. In the _Cancionero de Baena_ appears Mahomat-el-Xartosse,\r\nwithout his turban, as a full-fledged Spanish poet; and the old\r\ntradition of servility is continued by an anonymous refugee in Tunis,\r\nwho shows himself an authority on the plays and the lyric verse of Lope\r\nde Vega.\r\n\r\nIt is therefore erroneous to suppose that the northern Spaniards on\r\ntheir southward march fell in with numerous kinsmen, of wider culture\r\nand of a higher civilisation, whose everyday speech was unintelligible\r\nto them, and who prayed to Christ in the tongue of Muhammad. Such\r\ncases may have occurred, but as the rarest exceptions. Not less\r\nunfounded is the theory that Castilian is a fusion of southern\r\nacademic Arabic with barbarous northern Latin. In southern Spain Latin\r\npersisted, as Greek, Syriac, and Coptic persisted in other provinces\r\nof the Caliphate; and in the school founded at Córdoba by the Abbot\r\nSpera-in-Deo, Livy, Cicero, Virgil, Quintilian, and Demosthenes were\r\nread as assiduously as Sallust, Horace, and Terence were studied in\r\nthe northern provinces. Granting that Latin was for a while so much\r\nneglected that it was necessary to translate the Bible into Arabic, it\r\nis also true that Arabic grew so forgotten that Peter the Venerable\r\nwas forced to translate the Ku'rān for the benefit of clerks. Lastly,\r\nit must be borne in mind that the variety of Romance which finally\r\nprevailed in Spain was not the speech of the northern highlanders,\r\nbut that of the Muzárabes of the south and the centre. Long before\r\n\"the sword of Pelagius had been transformed into the sceptre of the\r\nCatholic kings,\" the linguistic triumph of the south was achieved. The\r\nhazard of war might have yielded another issue; and to adopt another\r\ncelebrated phrase of Gibbon's, but for the Cid and his successors, the\r\nKu'rān might now be taught in the schools of Salamanca, and her pulpits\r\nmight demonstrate to a circumcised people the sanctity and truth of\r\nthe revelation of Muhammad. As it chanced, Arabic was rebuffed, and\r\nthe Latin speech (or _Romance_) survived in its principal varieties of\r\nCastilian, Galician, Catalan, and _bable_ (Asturian).\r\n\r\nGallic Latin had already bifurcated into the _langue d'oui_ and the\r\n_langue d'oc_, though these names were not applied to the varieties\r\ntill near the close of the twelfth century. Two hundred years before\r\nRoderic's overthrow a Spanish horde raided the south-west of France,\r\nand, in the corner south of the Adour, reimposed a tongue which Latin\r\nhad almost entirely supplanted, and which lingered solely in the Basque\r\nProvinces and in Navarre. In the eighth century this Basque invasion\r\nwas avenged. The Spaniards, concentrating in the north, vacated the\r\neastern provinces, which were thereupon occupied by the Roussillonais,\r\nwho, spreading as far south as Valencia, and as far east as the\r\nBalearic Islands, gave eastern Spain a new language. Deriving from the\r\n_langue d'oc_, Catalan divides into _plá Catalá_ and _Lemosí_—the\r\ncommon speech and the literary tongue. Vidal de Besalu calls his own\r\nProvençal language _limosina_ or _lemozi_, and the name, taken from\r\nhis popular treatise _Dreita Maneira de Trobar_, was at first limited\r\nto literary Provençal; but endless confusion arises from the fact that\r\nwhen Catalans took to composing, their poems were likewise said to be\r\nwritten in _lengua lemosina_.\r\n\r\nThe Galician, akin to Portuguese, though free from the nasal element\r\ngrafted on the latter by Burgundians, is held by some for the\r\noldest—though clearly not the most virile—form of Peninsular Romance.\r\nIt was at least the first to ripen, and, under Provençal guidance,\r\nGalician verse acquired the flexibility needed for metrical effects\r\nlong before Castilian; so that Castilian court-poets, ambitious of\r\nfiner rhythmical results, were driven to use Galician, which is\r\nstrongly represented in the _Cancionero de Baena_, and boasts an\r\nearlier masterpiece in Alfonso the Learned's _Cantigas de Santa María_,\r\nrecently edited, as it deserved, after six centuries of waiting, by\r\nthat admirable scholar the Marqués de Valmar. Galician, now little\r\nmore than a simple dialect, is artificially kept alive by the efforts\r\nof patriotic minor poets; but its literary influence is extinct,\r\nand the distinguished figures of the province, as Doña Emilia Pardo\r\nBazán, naturally seek a larger audience by writing in Castilian.\r\nSo, too, _bable_ is but another dialect of little account, though a\r\npoet of considerable charm, Teodoro Cuesta (1829-95), has written in\r\nit verses which his own loyal people will not willingly let die.\r\nThe classification of other characteristic sub-genera—Andalucían,\r\nAragonese, Leonese—belongs to philology, and would be, in any event,\r\nout of place in the history of a literature to which, unlike Catalan\r\nand unlike Galician, they have added nothing of importance. What befell\r\nin Italy and France befell in Spain. Partly through political causes,\r\npartly by force of superior culture, the language of a single centre\r\nousted its rivals. As France takes its speech from Paris and the\r\nÎle de France, as Florence dominates Italy, so Castile dictates her\r\nlanguage to all the Spains. The dominant type, then, of Spanish is the\r\nCastilian, which, as the most potent form, has outlived its brethren,\r\nand, with trifling variations, now extends, not only over Spain, but\r\nas far west as Lima and Valparaiso, and as far east as the Philippine\r\nIslands: in effect, \"from China to Peru.\" And the Castilian of to-day\r\ndiffers little from the Castilian of the earliest monuments.\r\n\r\nThe first allusion to any distinct variety of Romance is found in the\r\nlife of a certain St. Mummolin who was Bishop of Noyen, succeeding St.\r\nEloi in 659. A reference to the Spanish type of Romance is found as far\r\nback as 734; but the authenticity of the document is very doubtful.\r\nThe breaking-up of Latin in Spain is certainly observable in Bishop\r\nOdoor's will under the date of 747. The celebrated Strasburg Oaths,\r\nthe oldest of Romance instruments, belong to the year 842; and, in\r\nan edict of 844, Charles the Bald mentions, as a thing apart, \"the\r\ncustomary language\"—_usitato vocabulo_—of the Spaniards. There is,\r\nhowever, no existing Spanish manuscript so ancient, nor is there any\r\nmonument as old, as the Italian _Carta di Capua_ (960). The British\r\nMuseum contains a curious codex from the Convent of Santo Domingo de\r\nSilos, on the margin of which a contemporary has written the vernacular\r\nequivalent of some four hundred Latin words; but this is no earlier\r\nthan the eleventh century. The Charter called the _Fuero de Avilés_ of\r\n1155 (which is in _bable_ or Asturian, not Castilian), has long passed\r\nfor the oldest example of Spanish, on the joint and several authority\r\nof González Llanos, Ticknor, and Gayangos; but Fernández-Guerra y Orbe\r\nhas proved it to be a forgery of much later date.\r\n\r\nThese intricate questions of authority and ascription may well be\r\nleft unsettled, for legal documents are but the dry bones of letters.\r\nCastilian literature dates roughly from the twelfth century. Though\r\nno Castilian document of extent can be referred to that period, the\r\n_Misterio de los Reyes Magos_ (The Mystery of the Magian Kings) and\r\nthe group of _cantares_ called the _Poema del Cid_ can scarcely\r\nbelong to any later time. These, probably, are the jetsam of a cargo\r\nof literature which has foundered. It is unlikely that the two most\r\nancient compositions in Castilian verse should be precisely the two\r\npreserved to us, and it is manifest that the epic as set forth in the\r\n_Poema del Cid_ could not have been a first effort. Doubtless there\r\nwere other older, shorter songs or _cantares_ on the Cid's prowess;\r\nthere unquestionably were songs upon Bernaldo de Carpio and upon\r\nthe Infantes de Lara which are rudely preserved in assonantic prose\r\npassages of the _Crónica General_. An ingenious, deceptive theory lays\r\nit down that the epic is but an amalgam of _cantilenas_, or short\r\nlyrics in the vulgar tongue. At most this is a pious opinion.\r\n\r\nTo judge by the analogy of other literatures, it is safe to say\r\nthat as verse always precedes prose (just as man feels before he\r\nreasons), so the epic everywhere precedes the lyric form, with the\r\npossible exception of hymns. The _Poema del Cid_, for instance, shows\r\nno trace of lyrical descent; and it is far likelier that the many\r\nsurviving _romances_ or ballads on the Cid are detached fragments\r\nof an epic, than that the epic should be a _pastiche_ of ballads\r\nput together nobody knows why, when, where, how, or by whom. But in\r\nany case the _cantilena_ theory is idle; for, since no _cantilenas_\r\nexist, no evidence is—or can be—forthcoming to eke out an attractive\r\nbut unconvincing thesis. In default of testimony and of intrinsic\r\nprobability, the theory depends solely on bold assertion, and it\r\nsuffices to say that the _cantilena_ hypothesis is now abandoned by all\r\nsave a knot of fanatical partisans.\r\n\r\nThe exploits of the battle-field would, in all likelihood, be\r\nthe first subjects of song; and the earliest singers of these\r\ndeeds—_gesta_—would appear in the chieftain's household. They sang to\r\ncheer the freebooters on the line of march, and a successful foray was\r\ncommemorated in some war-song like Dinas Vawr's:\r\n\r\n  \"_Ednyfed, King of Dyfed,\r\n  His head was borne before us;\r\n  His wine and beasts supplied our feasts,\r\n  And his overthrow our chorus._\"\r\n\r\nSoon the separation between combatants and singers became absolute:\r\nthe division has been effected in the interval which divides the\r\n_Iliad_ from the _Odyssey_. Achilles himself sings the heroes' glories;\r\nin the _Odyssey_ the _ἀοιδός_ or professional singer appears, to be\r\nsucceeded by the rhapsode. Slowly there evolve in Spain, as elsewhere,\r\ntwo classes of artists known as _trovadores_ and _juglares_.\r\nThe _trovadores_ are generally authors; the _juglares_ are mere\r\nexecutants—singers, declaimers, mimes, or simple mountebanks. Of\r\nthese lowlier performers one type has been immortalised in M. Anatole\r\nFrance's _Le Jongleur de Notre Dame_, a beautiful re-setting of the\r\nold story of _El Tumbeor_. But between _trovadores_ and _juglares_\r\nit is not possible to draw a hard-and-fast line: their functions\r\nintermingled. Some few _trovadores_ anticipated Wagner by eight or nine\r\ncenturies, composing their own music-drama on a lesser scale. In cases\r\nof special endowment, the composer of words and music delivered them to\r\nthe audience.\r\n\r\nSubdivisions abounded. There were the _juglares_ or singing-actors, the\r\n_remendadores_ or mimes, the _cazurros_ or mutes with duties undefined,\r\nresembling those of the intelligent \"super.\" Gifted _juglares_ at\r\nwhiles produced original work; a _trovador_ out of luck sank to\r\ndelivering the lines of his happier rivals; and a stray _remendador_\r\nstruggled into success as a _juglar_. There were _juglares de boca_\r\n(reciters) and _juglares de péñola_ (musicians). Even an official label\r\nmay deceive; thus a \"Gómez _trovador_\" is denoted in the year 1197, but\r\nthe likelihood is that he was a mere _juglar_. The normal rule was that\r\nthe _juglar_ recited the _trovador's_ verses; but, as already said, an\r\noccasional _trovador_ (Alfonso Álvarez de Villasandino, at Seville,\r\nin the fifteenth century, is a case in point) would declaim his own\r\nballad. In the _juglar's_ hands the original was cut or padded to suit\r\nthe hearers' taste. He subordinated the verses to the music, and gave\r\nthem maimed, or arabesqued with _estribillos_ (refrains), to fit a\r\npopular air. The monotonous repetition of epithet and clause, common\r\nto all early verse, is used to lessen the strain on the _juglar's_\r\nmemory. The commonest arrangement was that the _juglar de boca_ sang\r\nthe _trovador's_ words, the _juglar de péñola_ accompanying on some\r\nsimple instrument, while the _remendador_ gave the story in pantomime.\r\n\r\nAll the world over the history of early literatures is identical.\r\nWith the Greeks the minstrel attains at last an important post in\r\nthe chieftain's train. Seated on a high chair inlaid with silver, he\r\nentertains the guests, or guards the wife of Agamemnon, his patron and\r\nhis friend. Just so does Phemios sing amid the suitors of Penelope. It\r\nwas not always thus. Bentley has told us in his pointed way that \"poor\r\nHomer in those circumstances and early times had never such aspiring\r\nthoughts\" as mankind and everlasting fame; and that \"he wrote a sequel\r\nof songs and rhapsodies to be sung by himself for small earnings and\r\ngood cheer, at festivals, and other days of merriment.\" This rise\r\nand fall occurred in Spain as elsewhere. For her early _trovadores_\r\nor _juglares_, as for Demodokos in the _Odyssey_, and as for Fergus\r\nMacIvor's sennachie, a cup of wine sufficed. \"_Dat nos del vino si non\r\ntenedes dinneros_,\" says the _juglar_ who sang the Cid's exploits:\r\n\"Give us wine, if you have no money.\" Gonzalo de Berceo, the first\r\nCastilian writer whose name reaches us, is likewise the first Castilian\r\nto use the word _trovador_ in his _Loores de Nuestra Señora_ (The\r\nPraises of Our Lady):\r\n\r\n  \"_Aun merced te pido por el tu trobador._\"\r\n\r\n  (Thy favour I implore for this thy troubadour.)\r\n\r\nBut, though a priest and a _trovador_ proud of his double office,\r\nBerceo claims his wages without a touch of false shame. In his\r\n_Vida del glorioso Confesor Sancto Domingo de Silos_ he proves the\r\noverlapping of his functions by styling himself the saint's _juglar_;\r\nand in the opening of the same poem he vouches for it that his song\r\n\"will be well worth, as I think, a glass of good wine\":\r\n\r\n  \"_Bien valdrá, commo creo, un vaso de bon vino._\"\r\n\r\nAs popularity grew, modesty disappeared. The _trovador_, like the\r\nrest of the world, failed under the trials of prosperity. He became\r\nthe curled darling of kings and nobles, and haggled over prices and\r\nsalaries in the true spirit of \"our eminent tenor.\" In a rich land\r\nlike France he was given horses, castles, estates; in the poorer Spain\r\nhe was fain to accept, with intermittent grumblings, embroidered\r\nrobes, couches, ornaments—\"_muchos paños é sillas é guarnimientos\r\nnobres_.\" He was spoon-fed, dandled, pampered, and sedulously ruined\r\nby the disastrous good-will of his ignorant betters. These could not\r\nleave Ephraim alone: they too must wed his idols. Alfonso the Learned\r\nenlisted in the corps of _trovadores_, as Alfonso II. of Aragón had\r\ndone before him; and King Diniz of Portugal followed the example. To\r\npose as a _trovador_ became in certain great houses a family tradition.\r\nThe famous Constable, Álvaro de Luna, composes because his uncle,\r\nDon Pedro, the Archbishop of Toledo, has preceded him in the school.\r\nGrouped round the commanding figure of the Marqués de Santillana stand\r\nthe rivals of his own house-top: his grandfather, Pedro González de\r\nMendoza; his father, the Admiral Diego Furtado de Mendoza, a picaroon\r\npoet, spiteful, brutal, and witty; his uncle, Pedro Vélez de Guevara,\r\nwho turns you a song of roguery or devotion with equal indifference and\r\nmastery. Santillana's is \"a numerous house, with many kinsmen gay\";\r\nstill, in all save success, his case typifies a dominant fashion.\r\n\r\nIn the society of clerkly magnates the _trovador's_ accomplishments\r\ndeveloped; and the equipped artist was expected to be master of several\r\ninstruments, to be pat with litanies of versified tales, and to have\r\nVirgil at his finger-tips. Schools were founded where aspirants were\r\ntaught to _trobar_ and _fazer_ on classic principles, and the breed\r\nmultiplied till _trovador_ and _juglar_ possessed the land. The world\r\nentire—tall, short, old, young, nobles, serfs—did nought but make or\r\nhear verses, as that _trovador_ errant, Vidal de Besalu, records. It\r\nmay be that Poggio's anecdote of a later time is literally true: that a\r\npoor man, absorbed in Hector's story, paid the spouter to adjourn the\r\ncatastrophe from day to day till, his money being spent, he was forced\r\nto hear the end with tears.\r\n\r\nTroubadouring became at last a pestilence no less mischievous than its\r\nsuccessor knight-errantry, and its net was thrown more widely. Alfonso\r\nof Aragón led the way with a celebrated Provençal ballad, wherein he\r\navers that \"not snow, nor ice, nor summer, but God and love are the\r\nmotives of my song\":\r\n\r\n  \"_Mas al meu chan neus ni glatz\r\n  No m'ajuda, n'estaz,\r\n  Ni res, mas Dieus et amors._\"\r\n\r\nNot every man could hope to be a knight; but all ranks and both sexes\r\ncould—and did—sing of God and love. To emperors and princes must be\r\nadded the lowlier figures of Berceo, in Spain, or—to go afield for the\r\nextremest case—the _Joculator Domini_, the inspired madman, Jacopone\r\nda Todi, in Italy. With the _juglar_ strolled the primitive actress,\r\nthe _juglaresa_, mentioned in the _Libre del Apolonio_, and branded\r\nas \"infamous\" in Alfonso's code of _Las Siete Partidas_. At the court\r\nof Juan II., in the fifteenth century, the eccentric Garci Ferrandes\r\nof Jerena, a court poet, married a _juglaresa_, and lived to lament\r\nthe consequences in a _cántica_ of the _Cancionero de Baena_ (No.\r\n555). In northern Europe there flourished a tribe of jovial clerics\r\ncalled Goliards (after a mythical Pope Golias), who counted Catullus,\r\nHorace, and Ovid for their masters, and blent their anacreontics with\r\nblasphemy—as in the _Confessio Goliæ_, wrongly ascribed to our Walter\r\nMap. The repute of this gentry is chronicled in the _Canterbury Tales_:\r\n\r\n  \"_He was a jangler and a goliardeis,\r\n  And that was of most sin and harlotries._\"\r\n\r\nAnd the type, if not the name, existed in the Peninsula. So much might\r\nbe inferred from the introduction and passage of a law forbidding\r\nthe ordination of _juglares_; and, in the _Cancioneiro Portuguez\r\nda Vaticana_ (No. 931), Estevam da Guarda banters a _juglar_ who,\r\ntaking orders in expectance of a prebend which he never received, was\r\nprevented by his holy estate from returning to his craft. But close at\r\nhand, in the person of Juan Ruiz, Archpriest of Hita—the greatest name\r\nin early Castilian literature—is your Spanish Goliard incarnate.\r\n\r\nThe prosperity of _trovador_ and _juglar_ could not endure. First of\r\nforeign _trovadores_ to reach Spain, the Gascon Marcabru treats Alfonso\r\nVII. (1126-57) almost as an equal. Raimbaud de Vaquerias, in what must\r\nbe among the earliest copies of Spanish verse (not without a Galician\r\nsavour), holds his head no less high; and the apotheosis of the\r\n_juglar_ is witnessed by Vidal de Besalu at the court of Alfonso VIII.\r\n(1158-1214).\r\n\r\n  \"_Unas novas vos vuelh comtar\r\n  Que auzi dir a un joglar\r\n  En la cort del pus savi rei\r\n  Que anc fos de neguna lei._\"\r\n\r\n\"Fain would I give ye the verses which I heard recited by a _juglar_\r\nat the court of the most learned king that ever any rule beheld.\" This\r\nwas the \"happier Age of Gold.\" A century and a half later, Alfonso the\r\nLearned, himself, as we have seen, a _trovador_, classes the _juglar_\r\nand his assistants—_los que son juglares, e los remendadores_—with\r\nthe town pimp; and fathers not themselves _juglares_ are empowered to\r\ndisinherit any son who takes to the calling against his father's will.\r\nThe Villasandino, already mentioned, a pert Galician _trovador_ at Juan\r\nII.'s court, was glad to speak his own pieces at Seville, and candidly\r\navowed that, like his early predecessors, he \"worked for bread and\r\nwine\"—\"_labro por pan e vino_.\"\r\n\r\nThe foreign singer had received the half-pence; the native received the\r\nkicks. And in the last decline the executants were blind men who sang\r\nbefore church-doors and in public squares, lacing old ballads with what\r\nthey were pleased to call \"emendations,\" or, in other words, intruding\r\noriginal banalities of their own. This decline of material prosperity\r\nhad a most disastrous effect upon literature. A popular _cantar_ or\r\nsong was written by a poor man of genius. Accordingly he sold his\r\ncopyright: that is to say, he taught his _cantar_ to reciters, who paid\r\nin cash, or in drink, when they had it by heart, and thus the song\r\ntravelled the country overlong with no author's name attached to it.\r\nMore: repeated by many lips during a long period of years, the form of\r\na very popular _cantar_ manifestly ran the risk of change so radical\r\nthat within a few generations the original might be transformed in such\r\nwise as to be practically lost. This fate has, in effect, overtaken the\r\ngreat body of early Spanish song.\r\n\r\nIt is beyond question that there once existed _cantares_ (though we\r\ncannot fix their date) in honour of Bernaldo de Carpio, of Fernán\r\nGonzález, and of the Infantes de Lara; the point as regards the\r\nInfantes de Lara is proved to demonstration in the masterly study of\r\nD. Ramón Menéndez Pidal. The assonants of the original songs are found\r\npreserved in the chronicles, and no one with the most rudimentary idea\r\nof the conditions of Spanish prose-composition (whence assonants are\r\nbanned with extreme severity) can suppose that any Spaniard could write\r\na page of assonants in a fit of absent-mindedness. Two considerable\r\n_cantares de gesta_ of the Cid survive as fragments, and they owe their\r\nlives to a happy accident—the accident of being written down. They\r\nmust have had fellows, but probably not an immense number of them, as\r\nin France. If the formal _cantar de gesta_ died young, its spirit lived\r\ntriumphantly in the set chronicle and in the brief _romance_. In the\r\nchronicle the author aims at closer exactitude and finer detail, in\r\nthe _romance_ at swifter movement and at greater picturesqueness of\r\nartistic incident. The term _romanz_ or _romance_, first of all limited\r\nto any work written in the vernacular, is used in that sense by the\r\nearliest of all known troubadours, Count William of Poitiers.\r\n\r\nIn the thirteenth century, _romanz_ or _romance_ acquires a fresh\r\nmeaning in Spain, begins to be used as an equivalent for _cantar_,\r\nand ends by supplanting the word completely. Hence, by slow degrees,\r\n_romance_ comes to have its present value, and is applied to a\r\nlyrico-narrative poem in eight-syllabled assonants. The Spanish\r\n_Romancero_ is, beyond all cavil, the richest mine of ballad poetry\r\nin the world, and it was once common to declare that it embodied\r\nthe oldest known examples of Castilian verse. As the assertion is\r\nstill made from time to time, it becomes necessary to say that it\r\nis unfounded. It is true that the rude _cantar_ was never forgotten\r\nin Spain, and that its persistence partly explains the survival of\r\nassonance in Castilian long after its abandonment by the rest of\r\nEurope. In his historic letter to Dom Pedro, Constable of Portugal,\r\nthe Marqués de Santillana speaks with a student's contempt of singers\r\nwho, \"against all order, rule, and rhythm, invent these _romances_\r\nand _cantares_ wherein common lewd fellows do take delight.\" But no\r\nspecimens of the primitive age remain, and no existing _romance_ is\r\nolder than Santillana's own fifteenth century.\r\n\r\nThe numerous _Cancioneros_ from Baena's time to the appearance of the\r\n_Romancero General_ (the First Part printed in 1602, with additions in\r\n1604-14; the Second Part issued in 1605) present a vast collection of\r\nadmirable lyrics, mostly the work of accomplished courtly versifiers.\r\nThey contain very few examples of anything that can be justly called\r\nold popular songs. Alonso de Fuentes published in 1550 his _Libro\r\nde los Cuarenta Cantos de Diversas y Peregrinas Historias_, and in\r\nthe following year was issued Lorenzo de Sepúlveda's selection. Both\r\nprofess to reproduce the \"rusticity\" as well as the \"tone and metre\" of\r\nthe ancient _romances_; but, in fact, these songs, like those given\r\nby Escobar in the _Romancero del Cid_ (1612), are either written by\r\nsuch students as Cesareo, who read up his subject in the chronicles,\r\nand imitated the old manner as best he could, or they are due to others\r\nwho treated the oral traditions and _pliegos sueltos_ (broadsides) of\r\nSpain with the same inspired freedom that Burns showed to the local\r\nditties and chapbooks of Scotland. The two oldest _romances_ bearing\r\nany author's name are given in Lope de Stúñiga's _Cancionero_, and\r\nare the work of Carvajal, a fifteenth-century poet. Others may be\r\nof earlier date; but it is impossible to identify them, inasmuch as\r\nthey have been retouched and polished by singers of the fifteenth\r\nand sixteenth centuries. If they exist at all—a matter of grave\r\nuncertainty—they must be sought in the two Antwerp editions of Martin\r\nNucio's _Cancionero de Romances_ (one undated, the other of 1550), and\r\nin Esteban de Nájera's _Silva de Romances_, printed at Zaragoza in 1550.\r\n\r\nThere remains to say a last word on the disputed relation between\r\nthe early Castilian and French literatures. Like the auctioneer in\r\n_Middlemarch_, patriots \"talk wild\": as Amador de los Ríos in his\r\nmonumental fragment, and the Comte de Puymaigre in his essays. No fact\r\nis better established than the universal vogue of French literature\r\nbetween the twelfth and fourteenth centuries, a vogue which lasted\r\ntill the real supremacy of Dante and Boccaccio and Petrarch was\r\nreluctantly acknowledged. It is probable that Frederic Barbarossa wrote\r\nin Provençal; his nephew, Frederic II., sedulously aped the Provençal\r\nmanner in his Italian verses called the _Lodi della donna amata_. Marco\r\nPolo, Brunetto Latini, and Mandeville wrote in French for the same\r\nreason that almost persuaded Gibbon to write his _History_ in French.\r\nThe substitution of the Gallic for the Gothic character in the eleventh\r\ncentury advanced one stage further a process begun by the French\r\nadventurers who shared in the reconquest.\r\n\r\nWith these last came the French _jongleurs_ to teach the Spaniards the\r\ngentle art of making the _chanson de geste_. The very phrase, _cantar\r\nde gesta_, bespeaks its French source. As the root of the Cid epic lies\r\nin _Roland_, so the _Mystery of the Magian Kings_ is but an offshoot\r\nof the Cluny Liturgy. The earliest mention of the Cid, in the Latin\r\n_Chronicle of Almería_, joins the national hero, significantly enough,\r\nwith those two unexampled paragons of France, Oliver and Roland.\r\nAnother French touch appears in the _Poem of Fernán González_, where\r\nthe writer speaks of Charlemagne's defeat at Roncesvalles, and laments\r\nthat the battle was not an encounter with the Moors, in which Bernaldo\r\ndel Carpio might have scattered them. But we are not left to conjecture\r\nand inference; the presence of French _jongleurs_ is attested by\r\nirrefragable evidence.[1] Sancho I. of Portugal had at court a French\r\n_jongleur_ who in name, if in nothing else, somewhat resembled Guy de\r\nMaupassant's creation, \"Bon Amis.\" It is not proved that Sordello ever\r\nreached Spain; but, in the true manner of your bullying parasite, he\r\ndenounces St. Ferdinand as one who \"should eat for two, since he rules\r\ntwo kingdoms, and is unfit to govern one\":—\r\n\r\n  \"_E lo Reis castelás tanh qu'en manje per dos,\r\n  Quar dos regismes ten, ni per l'un non es pros._\"\r\n\r\nSordello, indeed, in an earlier couplet denounces St. Louis of France as\r\n\"a fool\"; but Sordello is a mere bilk and blackmailer with the gift of\r\nsong.\r\n\r\nAmong French minstrels traversing Spain are Père Vidal, who vaunts the\r\nlargesse of Alfonso VIII., and Guirauld de Calanson, who lickspittles\r\nthe name of Pedro II. of Aragón. Upon them followed Guilhem Azémar, a\r\n_déclassé_ noble, who sank to earning his bread as a common _jongleur_,\r\nand later on there comes a crowd of singing-quacks and booth-spouters.\r\nIt is usual to lay stress upon the influx of French among the pilgrims\r\nof the Milky Way on the road to the shrine of the national St. James\r\nat Santiago de Compostela in Galicia; and it is a fact that the first\r\nto give us a record of this pious journey is Aimeric Picaud in the\r\ntwelfth century, who unkindly remarks of the Basques, that \"when they\r\neat, you would take them for hogs, and when they speak, for dogs.\"\r\nThis vogue was still undiminished three hundred years later when our\r\nown William Wey (once Fellow of Eton, and afterwards, as it seems,\r\nan Augustinian monk at Edyngdon Monastery in Wiltshire) wrote his\r\n_Itinerary_ (1456). But though the pilgrimage to Santiago is noted as\r\na peculiarly \"French devotion\" by Lope de Vega in his _Francesilla_\r\n(1620), it is by no means clear that the French pilgrims outnumbered\r\nthose of other nations. Even if they did, this would not explain the\r\nliterary predominance of France. This is not to be accounted for by\r\nthe scampering flight of a horde of illiterate fakirs anxious only to\r\nsave their souls and reach their homes: it is rather the natural result\r\nof a steady immigration of clerks in the suites of French bishops and\r\nprinces, of French monks attracted by the spoil of Spanish monasteries,\r\nof French lords and knights and gentlemen who shared in the Crusades,\r\nand whose _jongleurs_, mimes, and tumblers came with them.\r\n\r\nExplain it as we choose, the influence of France on Spain is puissant\r\nand enduring. One sees it best when the Spaniard, natural or\r\nnaturalised, turns crusty. Roderic of Toledo (himself an archbishop\r\nof the Cluny clique) protests against those Spanish _juglares_ who\r\ncelebrate the fictitious victories of Charlemagne in Spain; and Alfonso\r\nthe Learned bears him out by deriding the songs and fables on these\r\nmythic triumphs, since the Emperor \"at most conquered somewhat in\r\nCantabria.\" A passage in the _Crónica General_ goes to show that some,\r\nat least, of the early French _jongleurs_ sang to their audiences in\r\nFrench—clearly, as it seems, to a select, patrician circle. And this\r\nraises, obviously, a curious question. It seems natural to admit that\r\nin Spain (let us say in Navarre and Upper Aragón) poems were written\r\nby French _trouvères_ and _troubadours_ in a mixed hybrid jargon; and\r\nthe very greatest of Spanish scholars, D. Marcelino Menéndez y Pelayo,\r\ninclines to believe in their possible existence. There is, in _L'Entrée\r\nen Espagne_, a passage wherein the author declares that, besides the\r\nsham _Chronicle_ of Turpin, his chief authorities are\r\n\r\n      \"_dous bons clerges Çan-gras et Gauteron,\r\n  Çan de Navaire et Gautier d'Arragon._\"\r\n\r\nJohn of Navarre and Walter of Aragón may be, as Señor Menéndez y\r\nPelayo suggests, two \"worthy clerks\" who once existed in the flesh,\r\nor they may be imaginings of the author's brain. More to the point is\r\nthe fact that, unlike the typical _chanson de geste_, this _Entrée\r\nen Espagne_ has two distinct types of rhythm (the Alexandrine and\r\nthe twelve-syllable line), as in the _Poema del Cid_; and not less\r\nsignificant is the foreign savour of the language. All that can be\r\nsafely said is that Señor Menéndez y Pelayo's theory is probable enough\r\nin itself, that it is presented with great ingenuity, that it is backed\r\nby the best authority that opinion can have, and that it is incapable\r\nof proof or disproof in the absence of texts.\r\n\r\nBut if Spain, unlike Italy, has no authentic poems in an intermediate\r\ntongue, proofs of French influence are not lacking in her earliest\r\nmovements. Two of the most ancient Castilian lyrics—_Razón feita\r\nd'Amor_ and the _Disputa del Alma_—are mere liftings from the French;\r\nthe _Book of Apolonius_ teems with Provençalisms, and the poem called\r\nthe _History of St. Mary of Egypt_ is so gallicised in idiom that Milá\r\ny Fontanals, a ripe scholar and a true-blue Spaniard, was half inclined\r\nto think it one of those intermediary productions which are sought in\r\nvain. At every point proofs of French guidance confront us. Anxious to\r\nbuffet and outrage his father's old _trovador_, Pero da Ponte, Alfonso\r\nthe Learned taunts him with illiteracy, seeing that he does not compose\r\nin the Provençal vein:—\r\n\r\n  \"_Vos non trovades como proençal._\"\r\n\r\nAnd, for our purpose, we are justified in appealing to Portugal for\r\ntestimony, remembering always that Portugal exaggerates the condition\r\nof things in Spain. King Diniz, Alfonso the Learned's nephew, plainly\r\nindicates his model when in the Vatican _Cancioneiro_ (No. 123)\r\nhe declares that he \"would fain make a love-song in the Provençal\r\nmanner\":—\r\n\r\n      \"_Quer' eu, en maneyra de proençal,\r\n  Fazer agora um cantar d'amor._\"\r\n\r\nAnd Alfonso's own _Cantigas_, honeycombed with Gallicisms, are frankly\r\nProvençal in their wonderful variety of metre. Nor should we suppose\r\nthat the Provençaux fought the battle alone: the northern _trouvères_\r\nbore their part.\r\n\r\nThe French school, then, is strong in Spain, omnipotent in Portugal,\r\nand, were the Spanish _Cancioneros_ as old as the Portuguese Song-book\r\nin the Vatican, we should probably find that the foreign influence was\r\nbut a few degrees less marked in the one country than in the other.\r\nAs it is, Alfonso the Learned ranks with any Portuguese of them all;\r\nand it is reasonable to think that he had fellows whose achievement\r\nand names have not reached us. For Spanish literature and ourselves\r\nthe loss is grave; and yet we cannot conceive that there existed in\r\nearly Castilian any examples comparable in elaborate lyrical beauty to\r\nthe _cantars d'amigo_ which the Galician-Portuguese singers borrowed\r\nfrom the French _ballettes_. In the first place, if they had existed,\r\nit is next to incredible that no example and no tradition of them\r\nshould survive. Next, the idea is intrinsically improbable, since the\r\nCastilian language was not yet sufficiently ductile for the purpose.\r\nMoreover, from the outset there is a counter-current in Castile. The\r\nearly Spanish legends are mostly concerned with Spanish subjects. Apart\r\nfrom obvious foreign touches in the early recensions of the story of\r\nBernaldo de Carpio (who figures as Charlemagne's nephew), the tone of\r\nthe ballads is hostile to the French, and, as is natural, the enmity\r\ngrows more pronounced with time. That national hero, the Cid, is\r\nespecially anti-French. He casts the King of France in gaol; he throws\r\naway the French King's chair with insult in St. Peter's. Still more\r\nsignificant is the fact that the character of French women becomes\r\na jest. Thus, the balladist emphasises the fact that the faithless\r\nwife of Garci-Fernández is French; and, again, when Sancho García's\r\nmother, likewise French, appears in a _romance_, the singer gives her\r\na blackamoor—an Arab—as a lover. This is primitive man's little\r\nway, the world over: he pays off old scores by deriding the virtue of\r\nhis enemy's wife, mother, daughter, sister; and in primitive Spain\r\nthe Frenchwoman is the lightning-conductor of international scandals,\r\ntolerable by the camp-fire, but tedious in print.\r\n\r\nIn considering early Spanish verse it behoves us to denote facts\r\nand to be chary in drawing inferences. Thus, while we admit that\r\nthe _Poema del Cid_ and the _Chanson de Roland_ belong to the same\r\n_genre_, we can go no further. It is not to be assumed that similarity\r\nof incident necessarily implies direct imitation. The introduction of\r\nthe fighting bishop in the Cid poem is a case in point. His presence\r\nin the field may be—almost certainly is—an historic event, common\r\nenough in days when a militant bishop loved to head a charge; and the\r\nchronicler may well have seen the exploits which he records. It by\r\nno means follows, and it is extravagant to suppose, that the Spanish\r\n_juglar_ merely filches from the _Chanson de Roland_. That he had\r\nheard the _Chanson_ is not only probable, but likely; it is not, to\r\nsay the least, a necessary consequence that he annexed an episode as\r\nfamiliar in Spain as elsewhere. Nothing, if you probe deep enough, is\r\nnew, and originality is a vain dream. But some margin must be left for\r\npersonal experience and the hazard of circumstance; and if we take\r\naccount of the chances of coincidence, the debt of Castilian to French\r\nliterature will appear in its due perspective. Nor must it be forgotten\r\nthat from a very early date there are traces of the reflex action of\r\nCastilian upon French literature. They are not, indeed, many; but they\r\nare authentic beyond carping. In the ancient _Fragment de la Vie de\r\nSaint Fidès d'Agen_, which dates from the eleventh century, the Spanish\r\norigin is frankly admitted:—\r\n\r\n  \"_Canson audi que bellantresca\r\n  Que fo de razon espanesca_\"—\r\n\r\n\"I heard a beauteous song that told of Spanish things.\" Or, once more,\r\nin Adenet le Roi's _Cléomadès_, and in its offshoot the _Méliacin_ of\r\nGirard d'Amiens, we meet with the wooden horse (familiar to readers\r\nof _Don Quixote_) which bestrides the spheres and curvets among the\r\nplanets. Borrowed from the East, the story is transmitted to the\r\nGreeks, is annexed by the Arabs, and is passed on through them to\r\nSpain, whence Adenet le Roi conveys it for presentation to the western\r\nworld.\r\n\r\nMore directly and more characteristically Spanish in its origin is the\r\nroyal epic entitled _Anséis de Carthage_. Here, after the manner of\r\nyour epic poet, chronology is scattered to the winds, and we learn that\r\nCharlemagne left in Spain a king who dishonoured the daughter of one\r\nof his barons; hence the invasion by the Arabs, whom the baron lets\r\nloose upon his country as avengers. The basis of the story is purely\r\nSpanish, being a somewhat clumsy arrangement of the legend of Roderic,\r\nCora, and Count Julian; the city of Carthage standing, it may be, for\r\nthe Spanish Cartagena. Hence it is clear that the mutual literary debt\r\nof Spain and France is, at this early stage, unequally divided. Spain,\r\nlike the rest of the world, borrows freely; but, with the course of\r\ntime, the position is reversed. Molière, the two Corneilles, Rotrou,\r\nSorel, Scarron, and Le Sage, to mention but a few eminent names at\r\nhazard, readjust the balance in favour of Spain; and the inexhaustible\r\nresources of the Spanish theatre, which supply the arrangements\r\nof scores of minor French dramatists, are but a small part of the\r\nliterature whose details are our present concern.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[1] See Milá y Fontanals, _Los Trovadores en España_ (Barcelona, 1889),\r\nand the same writer's _Resenya histórica y crítica dels antichs poetas\r\ncatalans_ in the third volume of his _Obras completas_ (Barcelona,\r\n1890).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER II\r\n\r\n                           THE ANONYMOUS AGE\r\n\r\n                               1150-1220\r\n\r\n\r\nIn Spain, as in all countries where it is possible to observe the\r\norigin and the development of letters, the earliest literature bears\r\nthe stamp of influences which are either epic or religious. These\r\nprimitive pieces are characterised by a vein of popular, unconscious\r\npoetry, with scarce a touch of personal artistry; and the ascription\r\nwhich refers one or other of them to an individual writer is, for\r\nthe most part, arbitrary. Insufficiency of data makes it impossible\r\nto identify the oldest literary performance in Spanish Romance. Jews\r\nlike Judah ben Samuel the Levite, and _trovadores_ like Rambaud de\r\nVaqueiras, arabesque their verses with Spanish tags and refrains;\r\nbut these are whimsies. Our choice lies rather between the _Misterio\r\nde los Reyes Magos_ (Mystery of the Magian Kings) and the so-called\r\n_Poema del Cid_ (Poem of the Cid). Experts differ concerning their\r\nrespective dates; but the liturgical derivation of the _Misterio_\r\ninclines one to hold it for the elder of the two. If Lidforss were\r\nright in attributing it to the eleventh century, the play would rank\r\namong the first in any modern language. Amador de los Ríos dates it\r\nstill further back. As these pretensions are excessive, the known facts\r\nmay be briefly given. The _Misterio_ follows upon a commentary on\r\nthe Lamentations of Jeremiah, written by a canon of Auxerre, Gilibert\r\nl'Universel, who died in 1134; and its existence was first denoted at\r\nthe end of the last century by Felipe Fernández Vallejo, Archbishop of\r\nSantiago de Compostela between 1798 and 1800, who correctly classified\r\nit as a dramatic scene to be given on the Feast of the Epiphany, and\r\nconsidered it a version from some Latin original. Both conjectures\r\nhave proved just. Throughout Europe the Christian theatre derives from\r\nthe Church, and the early plays are but a lay vernacular rendering of\r\nmodels studied in the sanctuary. Simplified as the liturgy now is,\r\nthe Mass itself, the services of Palm Sunday and Good Friday, are the\r\nunmistakable _débris_ of an elaborate sacred drama.\r\n\r\nThe Spanish _Misterio_ proceeds from one of the Latin offices used at\r\nLimoges, Rouen, Nevers, Compiègne, and Orleans, with the legend of the\r\nMagi for a motive; and these, in turn, are dramatic renderings of pious\r\ntraditions, partly oral, and partly amplifications of the apocryphal\r\n_Protevangelium Jacobi Minoris_ and the _Historia de Nativitate Mariæ\r\net de Infantiâ Salvatoris_.[2] These Franco-Latin liturgical plays,\r\nhere mentioned in the probable order of their composition during the\r\neleventh and twelfth centuries, reached Spain through the Benedictines\r\nof Cluny; and as in each original redaction there is a distinct advance\r\nupon its immediate predecessor, so in the Spanish rendering these\r\nprimitive exemplars are developed. In the Limoges version there is\r\nno action, the rudimentary dialogue consisting in the allotment of\r\nliturgical phrases among the personages; in the Rouen office, the\r\nnumber of actors is increased, and Herod, though he does not appear, is\r\nmentioned; a still later redaction brings the shepherds on the scene.\r\nThe Spanish _Misterio_ reaches us as a fragment of some hundred and\r\nfifty lines, ending at the moment when the rabbis consult their sacred\r\nbooks upon Herod's appeal to\r\n\r\n        \"_the prophecies\r\n  Which Jeremiah spake_.\"\r\n\r\nIts _provenance_ is proved by the inclusion of three Virgilian lines\r\n(_Æneid_, viii. 112-114), lifted by the arranger of the Orleans rite.\r\nThe Magi are mentioned by name, and one speech is given by Gaspar:\r\nimportant points which help to fix the date of writing. A passage\r\nin Bede speaks of Melchior, _senex et canus_; of Baltasar, _fuscus,\r\nintegre barbatus_; of Gaspar, _juvenis imberbis_; but this appears to\r\nbe interpolated. The names likewise appear in the famous sixth-century\r\nmosaic of the Church of Sant' Apollinare della Città at Ravenna;\r\nand here, again, the insertion is probably a pious afterthought. If\r\nHartmann be justified in his contention, that the traditional names of\r\nthe Magi were not in vogue till after the alleged discovery of their\r\nremains at Milan in 1158, the Spanish _Misterio_ can be, at best, no\r\nolder than the end of the twelfth century.\r\n\r\nEnough of it remains to show that the Spanish workman improved upon his\r\nmodels. He elaborates the dramatic action, quickens the dialogue with\r\nnewer life, and gives his scene an ampler, a more vivid atmosphere.\r\nLed by the heavenly star, the three Magi first appear separately, then\r\ntogether; they celebrate the birth of Christ, whom they seek to adore,\r\nat the end of their thirteen days' pilgrimage. Encountering Herod,\r\nthey confide to him their mission; the King conjures his \"abbots\"\r\n(rabbis), counsellors, and soothsayers to search the mystic books, and\r\nto say whether the Magis' tale be true. The passages between Herod\r\nand his rabbis are marked by intensity and passion, far exceeding the\r\nFranco-Latin models in dramatic force; and there is a corresponding\r\nprogress of mechanism, distribution, and rapidity.\r\n\r\nThere is even a breath of the critical spirit wholly absent from\r\nall other early mysteries, which accept the miraculous sign of the\r\nstar with a simple, unquestioning faith. In our play, the first and\r\nthird Magi wish to observe it another night, while the second King\r\nwould fain watch it for three entire nights. Lastly, the scale of the\r\n_Misterio_ is larger than that of any predecessor; the personages are\r\nnot huddled upon the scene at once, but appear in appropriate, dramatic\r\norder, delivering more elaborate speeches, and expressing at greater\r\nlength more individual emotions. This fragmentary piece, written in\r\noctosyllabics, forms the foundation-stone of the Spanish theatre; and\r\nfrom it are evolved, in due progression, \"the light and odour of the\r\nflowery and starry _Autos_\" which were to enrapture Shelley. Important\r\nand venerable as is the _Misterio_, its freer treatment of the liturgy,\r\nits effectual blending of realism with devotion, and its swiftness of\r\naction are so many arguments against its reputed antiquity. It is still\r\nold if we adopt the conclusion that it was written some twenty years\r\nbefore the _Poema del Cid_.\r\n\r\nThis misnamed epic, no unworthy fellow to the _Chanson de Roland_, is\r\nthe first great monument of Spanish literature. Like the _Misterio\r\nde los Reyes Magos_, like so many early pieces, the _Poema del Cid_\r\nreaches us maimed and mutilated. The beginning is lost; a page in the\r\nmiddle, containing some fifty lines following upon verse 2338, has\r\ngone astray from our copy; and the end has been retouched by unskilful\r\nfingers. The unique manuscript in which the _cantar_ exists belongs to\r\nthe fourteenth century: so much is now settled after infinite disputes.\r\nThe original composition is thought to date from about the middle third\r\nof the twelfth century (1135-75), some fifty years after the Cid's\r\ndeath at Valencia in 1099. Hence the _Poem of the Cid_ stands almost\r\nmidway between the _Chanson de Roland_ and the _Niebelungenlied_.\r\nNevertheless, in its surviving shape it is the result of innumerable\r\nretouches which amount to botching. Its authorship is more than\r\ndoubtful, for the Per Abbat who obtrudes in the closing lines is,\r\nlike the Turoldus of _Roland_, the mere transcriber of an unfaithful\r\ncopy. Our gratitude to Per Abbat is dashed with regret for his\r\nslapdash methods. The assonants are roughly handled, whole phrases are\r\nunintelligently repeated, are transferred from one line to another, or\r\nare thrust out from the text, and in some cases two lines are crushed\r\ninto one. The prevailing metre is the Alexandrine or fourteen-syllabled\r\nverse, probably adopted in conscious imitation of that Latin chronicle\r\non the conquest of Almería which first reveals the national champion\r\nunder his popular title—\r\n\r\n  \"_Ipse Rodericus, Mio Cid semper vocatus,\r\n  De quo cantatur, quod ab hostibus haud superatus._\"\r\n\r\nHowever that may be, the normal measure is reproduced with curious\r\ninfelicity. Some lines run to twenty syllables, some halt at ten, and\r\nit cannot be doubted that many of these irregularities are results of\r\ncareless copying. Still, to Per Abbat we owe the preservation of the\r\nCid _cantar_ as we owe to Sánchez its issue in 1779, more than half a\r\ncentury before any French _chanson de geste_ was printed.\r\n\r\nThe Spanish epic has a twofold theme—the exploits of the exiled Cid,\r\nand the marriage of his two (mythical) daughters to the Infantes de\r\nCarrión. Diffused through Europe by the genius of Corneille, who\r\nconveyed his conception from Guillén de Castro, the legendary Cid\r\ndiffers hugely from the Cid of history. Uncritical scepticism has\r\ndenied his existence; but Cervantes, with his good sense, hit the white\r\nin the first part of _Don Quixote_ (chapter xlix.). Unquestionably\r\nthe Cid lived in the flesh: whether or not his alleged achievements\r\noccurred is another matter. Irony has incidentally marked him for its\r\nown. The mercenary in the pay of Zaragozan emirs is fabled as the\r\nmodel Spanish patriot; the plunderer of churches becomes the flower of\r\northodoxy; the cunning intriguer who rifled Jews and mocked at treaties\r\nis transfigured as the chivalrous paladin; the unsentimental trooper\r\nwho never loved is delivered unto us as the typical _jeune premier_.\r\nLastly, the mirror of Spanish nationality is best known by his Arabic\r\ntitle (_Sidi_ = lord). Yet two points must be kept in mind: the facts\r\nwhich discredit him are reported by hostile Arab historians; and,\r\nagain, the Cid is entitled to be judged by the standard of his country\r\nand his time. So judged, we may accept the verdict of his enemies, who\r\ncursed him as \"a miracle of the miracles of God and the conqueror of\r\nbanners.\" Ruy Diaz de Bivar—to give him his true name—was something\r\nmore than a freebooter whose deeds struck the popular fancy: he stood\r\nfor unity, for the supremacy of Castile over León, and his example\r\nproved that, against almost any odds, the Spaniards could hold their\r\nown against the Moors. In the long night between the disaster of\r\nAlarcos and the crowning triumph of Navas de Tolosa, the Cid's figure\r\ngrew glorious as that of the man who had never despaired of his\r\ncountry, and in the hour of victory the legend of his inspiration was\r\nnot forgotten. From his death at Valencia in 1099, his memory became a\r\nnational possession, embellished by popular poetic fancy.\r\n\r\nIn the _Poema_ the treatment is obviously modelled upon the _Chanson de\r\nRoland_. But there is a fixed intent to place the Spaniard first. The\r\nCid is pictured as more human than Roland: he releases his prisoners\r\nwithout ransom; he gives them money so that they may reach their homes.\r\nCharlemagne, in the _Chanson_, destroys the idols in the mosques,\r\nbaptizes a hundred thousand Saracens by force, hangs or flays alive\r\nthe recalcitrant; the Cid shows such humanity to a conquered province\r\nthat on his departure the Moors burst forth weeping, and pray for his\r\nprosperous voyage. The machinery in both cases is very similar. As the\r\narchangel Gabriel appears to Charlemagne, he appears likewise to the\r\nCid Campeador. Bishop Turpin opens the battle in _Roland_, and Bishop\r\nJerome heads the charge for Spain. Roland and Ruy Diaz are absolved\r\nand exhorted to the same effect, and the resemblance of the epithet\r\n_curunez_ applied to the French bishop is too close to the _coronado_\r\nof the Spaniard to be accidental. But allowing for the fact that the\r\nSpanish _juglar_ borrows his framework, his performance is great by\r\nvirtue of its simplicity, its strength, its spirit and fire. Whether\r\nhe deals with the hungry loyalty of the Cid in exile, or his reception\r\ninto favour by an ingrate king; whether he celebrates the overthrow of\r\nthe Count of Barcelona or the surrender of Valencia; whether he sings\r\nthe nuptials of Elvira and Sol with the Infantes de Carrión, or the\r\navenging Cid who seeks reparation from his craven son-in-law, the touch\r\nis always happy and is commonly final.\r\n\r\nThere is an unity of conception and of language which forbids our\r\naccepting the _Poema_ as the work of several hands; and the division\r\nof the poem into separate _cantares_ is managed with a discretion\r\nwhich argues a single artistic intelligence. The first part closes\r\nwith the marriage of the hero's daughters; the second with the shame\r\nof the Infantes de Carrión, and the proud announcement that the kings\r\nof Spain are sprung from the Cid's loins. In both the singer rises to\r\nthe level of his subject, but his chiefest gust is in the recital of\r\nsome brilliant deed of arms. Judge him when, in a famous passage well\r\nrendered by Ormsby, he sings the charge of the Cid at Alcocer:—\r\n\r\n  \"_With bucklers braced before their breasts, with lances pointing low,\r\n  With stooping crests and heads bent down above the saddle-bow,\r\n  All firm of hand and high of heart they roll upon the foe.\r\n  And he that in a good hour was born, his clarion voice rings out,\r\n  And clear above the clang of arms is heard his battle-shout,\r\n  'Among them, gentlemen! Strike home for the love of charity!\r\n  The Champion of Bivar is here—Ruy Diaz—I am he!'\r\n  Then bearing where Bermuez still maintains unequal fight,\r\n  Three hundred lances down they come, their pennons flickering white;\r\n  Down go three hundred Moors to earth, a man to every blow;\r\n  And, when they wheel, three hundred more, as charging back they go.\r\n  It was a sight to see the lances rise and fall that day;\r\n  The shivered shields and riven mail, to see how thick they lay;\r\n  The pennons that went in snow-white come out a gory red;\r\n  The horses running riderless, the riders lying dead;\r\n  While Moors call on Muhammad, and 'St. James!' the Christians cry._\"\r\n\r\nIndubitably this (and it were easy to match it elsewhere in the\r\n_Poema_) is the work of an original genius who redeems his superficial\r\nborrowings of incident from _Roland_ by a treatment all his own. That\r\nhe knew the French models is evident from his skilful conveyance of the\r\nbear episode in _Ider_ to his own pages, where the Cid encounters the\r\nbeast as a lion. But the language shows no hint of French influence,\r\nand both thought and expression are profoundly national. The poet's\r\nname is irrecoverable, but the internal evidence points strongly to\r\nthe conclusion that he came from the neighbourhood of Medina Celi.\r\nThe surmise that he was an Asturian rests solely upon the absence of\r\nthe diphthong _ue_ from his lines, an inference on the face of it\r\nunwarrantable. Against this is the topographical minuteness with which\r\nthe poet reports the sallies of the Cid in the districts of Castejón\r\nand Alcocer; his marked ignorance of the country round Zaragoza and\r\nValencia, his detailed description of the central episode—the outrage\r\nupon the Cid's daughters in the wood of Corpes, near Berlanga; and\r\nthe important fact that the four chief itineraries in the _Poema_\r\nare charged with minutiæ from Molina to San Esteban de Gormaz, while\r\nthey grow vague and more confused as they extend towards Burgos and\r\nValencia. The most probable conjecture, then, is that the unknown maker\r\nof this primitive masterpiece came from the Valle de Arbujuelo; and\r\nit is worth adding that this opinion is supported by the authority\r\nof Sr. Menéndez Pidal. Perhaps the greatest testimony to the early\r\npoet's worth is to be found in this: that his conception of his hero\r\nhas outlived the true historic Cid, and has forced the child of his\r\nimagination upon the acceptance of mankind.\r\n\r\nEven more fantastic is the personality of Ruy Diaz as rendered by\r\nthe anonymous compiler of the _Crónica Rimada_ (Rhymed Chronicle of\r\nEvents in Spain from the Death of King Pelayo to Ferdinand the Great,\r\nand more especially of the Adventures of the Cid). The composition\r\nwhich bears this clumsy and inappropriate title is better named the\r\n_Cantar de Rodrigo_, and consists of 1125 lines, preceded by a scrap\r\nof rugged prose. Not till after digressions into other episodes,\r\nand irrelevant stories of Miro and Bernardo, Bishops of Palencia,\r\nprobably fellow-townsmen of the compiler, does the Cid appear. He is\r\nno longer, as in the _Poema_, a popular hero, idealised from historic\r\nreport; he is a purely imaginary figure, incrusted with a mass of\r\nfables accumulated in course of time. At the age of twelve he slays\r\nGómez Górmaz (an almost impossible style, compounded of a patronymic\r\nand the name of a castle belonging to the Cid), is claimed by the\r\ndead man's daughter, weds her, vanquishes the Moors, and leads his\r\nKing's—Fernando's—troops to the gates of Paris, defeating the Count\r\nof Savoy upon the road. One legend is heaped upon another, and the\r\npoem, the end of which is lost, breaks off with the Pope's request\r\nfor a year's truce, which Fernando, acting as ever upon the Cid's\r\nadvice, magnanimously extends for twelve years. It is hard to say\r\nwhether the _Cantar de Rodrigo_ as we have it is the production of\r\na single composer, or whether it is a patchwork by different hands,\r\narranged from earlier poems, and eked out by prose stories and by oral\r\ntraditions. The versification is that of the simple sixteen-syllabled\r\nline, each hemistich of which forms a typical _romance_ line. This\r\nin itself is a sign of its later date, and to this must be added\r\nthe traces of deliberate imitation of the _Poema_, and the writer's\r\nfamiliarity with such modern devices as heraldic emblems. Further,\r\nthe use of a Provençal form like _gensor_, the unmistakable tokens of\r\nFrench influence, the anticipation of the metre of the clerkly poems,\r\nthe writer's frank admission of earlier songs on the same subject,\r\nthe metamorphosis of the Cid into a feudal baron, and, above all, the\r\ndecadent spirit of the entire work: these are tokens which imply a\r\nrelative modernity. Much of the obscurity of language, which has been\r\nmistaken for archaism, is simply due to the defects of the manuscript;\r\nand the evidence goes to show that the _Rodrigo_, put together in the\r\nlast decade of the twelfth century or the first of the thirteenth, was\r\nretouched in the fourteenth by Spanish _juglares_ humiliated by the\r\nrecent French invasions. Even so, much of the primitive _pastiche_\r\nremains, and the _Rodrigo_, which is mentioned in the _General\r\nChronicle_, interests us as being the fountain-head of those _romances_\r\non the Cid whose collection we owe to that enthusiastic and most\r\nlearned investigator, Madame Carolina Michaëlis de Vasconcellos. Far\r\ninferior in merit and interest to the _Poema_, the _Rodrigo_ ranks with\r\nit as representative of the submerged mass of _cantares de gesta_, and\r\nis rightly valued as the venerable relic of a lost school.\r\n\r\nTo these succeed three anonymous poems, the _Libro de Apolonio_ (Book\r\nof Apollonius), the _Vida de Santa María Egipciaqua_ (Life of St. Mary\r\nthe Egyptian), and the _Libre dels Tres Reyes dorient_ (Book of the\r\nThree Eastern Kings), all discovered in one manuscript in the Escurial\r\nLibrary by Pedro José Pidal, and first published by him in 1844. The\r\nstory of Apollonius, supposed to be a translation of a Greek _romance_,\r\nfilters into European literature by way of the _Gesta Romanorum_,\r\nis found even in Icelandic and Danish versions, and is familiar to\r\nEnglish readers of _Pericles_. The nameless Spanish arranger of the\r\nthirteenth century (probably a native of Aragón) gives the story of\r\nApollonius' adventures with force and clearness, anticipating in the\r\ncharacter of Tarsiana the type of Preciosa, the heroine of Cervantes'\r\n_Gitanilla_ and of Weber's opera. Unfortunately the closing tags of\r\nmoralisings on the vanity of life destroy the effect which the writer\r\nhas produced by his free translation. His text is suffused with\r\nProvençalisms, and his mono-rhymed quatrains of fourteen syllables\r\nare evidence of French or Provençal origin. This metrical novelty,\r\nextending over more than six hundred stanzas, is properly regarded by\r\nthe author as his chief distinction, and he implores God and the Virgin\r\nto guide him in the exercise of the new mastery (_nueva maestría_). It\r\nis fair to add that his experiment has the interest of novelty, that\r\nit succeeded beyond measure in its time, and that its monotonous vogue\r\nendured for some two hundred years.\r\n\r\nTo the same period belongs the _Vida de Santa María Egipciaqua_, the\r\nearliest Castilian example of verses of nine syllables. In substance it\r\nis a version of the _Vie de Saint Marie l'Egyptienne_, ascribed without\r\nmuch reason to the veritable Bishop of Lincoln, Robert Grosseteste (?\r\n1175-1253), among whose _Carmina Anglo-Normannica_ the French original\r\nis interpolated. The Spanish version follows the French lead with\r\nalmost pedantic exactitude; but the metre, new and well suited to the\r\ncommon ear, is handled with an easy grace remarkable in a first effort.\r\nAs happens with other works of this time, the title of the short _Libre\r\ndels Tres Reyes dorient_ is misleading. The visit of the Magi is\r\nbriefly dismissed in the first fifty lines, the poem turning chiefly\r\nupon the Flight into Egypt, the miracle wrought upon the leprous child\r\nof the robber, and the identification of the latter with the repentant\r\nthief of the New Testament. Like its predecessor, this legend is given\r\nin nine-syllabled verse, and is undoubtedly borrowed from a French or\r\nProvençal source not yet discovered.\r\n\r\nIn the _Disputa del Alma y el Cuerpo_ (Argument betwixt Body and Soul),\r\na subject which passes into all mediæval literatures from a copy of\r\nLatin verses styled _Rixa Animi et Corporis_, there is a recurrence,\r\nthough with innumerable variants of measure, to the Alexandrine type.\r\nThus it is sought to reproduce the music of the model, an Anglo-Norman\r\npoem, written in rhymed couplets of six syllables, and wrongly\r\nattributed to Walter Map. With it should go the _Debate entre el Agua\r\ny el Vino_ (Debate between Water and Wine), and the first Castilian\r\nlyric, _Razón feita d'Amor_ (the Lay of Love). Composed in verses of\r\nnine syllables, the poem deals with the meeting of two lovers, their\r\ncolloquy, interchanges, and separation. Both pieces, discovered within\r\nthe last seventeen years by M. Morel-Fatio, are the productions of a\r\nsingle mind. It is tempting to identify the writer with the Lope de\r\nMoros mentioned in the final line, \"_Lupus me feçit de Moros_\"; still\r\nthe likelihood is that, here as elsewhere, the copyist has but signed\r\nhis transcription. Whoever the author may have been—and the internal\r\nevidence tends to show that he was a clerk familiar with French,\r\nProvençal, Italian, or Portuguese exemplars—he shines by virtue\r\nof qualities which are akin to genius. His delicacy and variety of\r\nsentiment, his finish of workmanship, his deliberate lyrical effects,\r\nannounce the arrival of the equipped artist, the craftsman no longer\r\ncontent with rhymed narration, the singer with a personal, distinctive\r\nnote. Here was a poet who recognised that in literature—the least\r\nmoral of the arts—the end justifies the means; hence he transformed\r\nthe material which he borrowed, made it his own possession, and\r\nconveyed into Castile a new method adapted to her needs. But time and\r\nlanguage were not yet ripe, and the Spanish lyric flourished solely\r\nin Galicia: it was not to be transplanted at a first attempt. Yet the\r\nattempt was worth the trial; for it closes the anonymous period with\r\na triumph to which, if we except the _Poema del Cid_, it can show no\r\nfellow.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[2] Joannes Karl Thilo, _Codex Apocryphus Novi Testamenti_.

A few details are known of him. He was certainly a deacon in\r\n1220, and his name occurs in documents between 1237 and 1264. He speaks\r\nof his advanced age in the _Vida de Santa Oria, Virgen_, his latest and\r\nperhaps most finished work; and his birthplace, Berceo, is named in his\r\n_Historia del Señor San Millán de Cogolla_, as in his rhymed biography\r\nof _St. Dominic of Silas_. His copiousness runs to some thirteen\r\nthousand lines, including, besides the works already named, the\r\n_Sacrificio de la Misa_ (Sacrifice of the Mass), the _Martirio de San\r\nLorenzo_ (Martyrdom of St. Lawrence), the _Loores de Nuestra Señora_\r\n(Praises of Our Lady), the _Signos que aparecerán ante del Juicio_\r\n(Signs visible before the Judgment), the _Milagros de Nuestra Señora_\r\n(Miracles of Our Lady), the _Duelo que hizo la Virgen María el día de\r\nla Pasión de su hijo Jesucristo_ (The Virgin's Lament on the day of her\r\nSon's Passion), and three hymns to the Holy Ghost, the Virgin, and God\r\nthe Father. In most editions of Berceo there is appended to his verses\r\na poem in his praise, attributed to an unknown writer of the fourteenth\r\ncentury. This poem is, in fact, conjectured to be an invention of\r\nTomás Antonio Sánchez, the earliest editor of Berceo's complete works\r\n(1779). The chances are that Berceo and his writings had passed out of\r\nremembrance within two hundred years of his death, and he was evidently\r\nunknown to Santillana in the fifteenth century. But a brief extract\r\nfrom him is given in the _Moisén Segundo_ (Second Moses) of Ambrosio\r\nGómez, published in 1653. With the exception of the _Martirio de San\r\nLorenzo_, of which the end is lost, all Berceo's writings have been\r\npreserved, and he suffers by reason of his exuberance.\r\n\r\nHe sings in the vernacular, he declares, being too unlearned in the\r\nLatin; but he has his little pretensions. Though he calls himself a\r\n_juglar_, he marks the differences between his _dictados_ (poems) and\r\nthe _cantares_ (songs) of a plain _juglar_, and he vindicates his title\r\nby that monotonous metre—the _cuaderna vía_—which was taken up in\r\nthe _Libro de Apolonio_ and became the model of all learned clerks in\r\nthe next generations. Berceo uses the rhythm with success, and if his\r\nresults are not splendid, it was not because he lacked perseverance.\r\nOn the contrary, his industry was only too formidable. And, as a\r\nlittle of the mono-rhymed quatrain goes far, he must have perished had\r\nhe depended upon execution. Beside Dante's achievement, as Puymaigre\r\nnotes, the paraphrases of Berceo in the _Sacrificio de la Misa_\r\n(stanzas 250-266) seem thin and pale; but the comparison is unfair to\r\nthe earlier Castilian singer, who died in his obscure hamlet without\r\nthe advantage of Dante's splendid literary tradition. Berceo is\r\nhampered by his lack of imagination, by the poverty of his conditions,\r\nby the absence of models, by the narrow circle of his subjects, and by\r\nthe pious scruples which hindered him from arabesquing the original\r\ndesign. Yet he possesses the gifts of simplicity and of unction, and\r\namid his long digressions into prosy theological commonplace there\r\nare flashes of mystic inspiration unmatched by any other poet of his\r\ncountry and his time. Even when his versification, clear but hard, is\r\nat its worst, he accomplishes the end which he desires by popularising\r\nthe pious legends which were dear to him. He was not—never could have\r\nbeen—a great poet. But in his own way he was, if not an inventor, the\r\nchief of a school, and the necessary predecessor of such devout authors\r\nas Luis de León and St. Teresa. He was a pioneer in the field of devout\r\npastoral, with all the defects of the inexperienced explorer; and,\r\nfor the most part, he had nothing to guide him but his own uncultured\r\ninstinct. Some specimen of his work may be given in Hookham Frere's\r\nlittle-known fragmentary version of the _Vida de San Millán_:—\r\n\r\n  \"_He walked those mountains wild, and lived within that nook\r\n  For forty years and more, nor ever comfort took\r\n  Of offer'd food or alms, or human speech a look;\r\n  No other saint in Spain did such a penance brook._\r\n\r\n  _For many a painful year he pass'd the seasons there,\r\n  And many a night consumed in penitence and prayer—\r\n  In solitude and cold, with want and evil fare,\r\n  His thoughts to God resigned, and free from human care._\r\n\r\n  _Oh! sacred is the place, the fountain and the hill,\r\n  The rocks where he reposed, in meditation still,\r\n  The solitary shades through which he roved at will:\r\n  His presence all that place with sanctity did fill._\"\r\n\r\nThis is Berceo in a very characteristic vein, dealing with his own\r\nspecial saint in his chosen way—the way of the \"new mastery\"; and\r\nhe keeps to the same rhythm in the nine hundred odd stanzas which he\r\nstyles the _Milagros de Nuestra Señora_. Here his devotion inspires\r\nhim to more conscientious effort; and it has been sought to show\r\nthat Berceo takes his tales as he finds them in the _Miracles de la\r\nSainte Vierge_, by the French _trouvère_, Gautier de Coinci, Prior of\r\nVic-sur-Aisne (1177-1236). Certain it is that Gautier's source, the\r\nSoissons manuscript, was known to Alfonso the Learned, who mentions it\r\nin the sixty-first of his Galician songs as \"a book full of miracles\":—\r\n\r\n  \"_En Seixons ... un liuro a todo cheo de miragres._\"\r\n\r\nThere were doubtless earlier Latin collections—amongst others, Vincent\r\nde Beauvais' _Speculum historiale_ and Pothon's _Liber de miraculis\r\nSanctæ Dei Genitricis Mariæ_—which both Berceo and Alfonso used. But\r\nsince Alfonso, a middle-aged man when Berceo died, knew the Soissons\r\ncollection, it seems possible that Berceo also handled it. A close\r\nexamination of his text converts the bare possibility into something\r\napproaching certainty. Of Berceo's twenty-five Marian legends, eighteen\r\nare given by Gautier de Coinci, whose total reaches fifty-five. This\r\nis not by itself final, for both writers might have selected them from\r\na common source. Yet there are convincing proofs of imitation in the\r\ncoincidences of thought and expression which are apparent in Gautier\r\nand Berceo. These are too numerous to be accidental; and still more\r\nweight must be given to the fact that in several cases where Gautier\r\ninvents a detail of his own wit, Berceo reproduces it. Taken in\r\nconjunction with his known habit of strict adherence to his text, it\r\nfollows that Berceo took Gautier for his guide. He did what all the\r\nworld was doing in borrowing from the French, and in the _Virgin's\r\nLament_ he has the candour to confess the northern supremacy.\r\n\r\nStill, it would be wrong to think that Berceo contents himself with\r\nmere servile reproduction, or that he trespasses in the manner of\r\na vulgar plagiary. Seven of his legends he seeks elsewhere than in\r\nGautier, and he takes it upon himself to condense his predecessor's\r\ndiffuse narration. Thus, where Gautier needs 1350 lines to tell the\r\nlegend of St. Ildefonsus, or 2090 to give the miracle of Theophilus,\r\nBerceo confines himself to 108 and to 657 lines. Gautier will spare\r\nyou no detail; he will have you know the why, the when, the how, the\r\npaltriest circumstance of his pious story. Beside him Berceo shines by\r\nhis power of selection, by his finer instinct for the essential, by\r\nhis relative sobriety of tone, by his realistic eye, by his variety of\r\nresource in pure Castilian expression, by his richer melody, and by the\r\nfleeter movement of his action. In a word, with all his imperfections,\r\nBerceo approves himself the sounder craftsman of the two, and therefore\r\nhe finds thirty readers where the Prior of Vic-sur-Aisne finds one.\r\nSmall and few as his opportunities were, he rarely failed to use\r\nthem to an advantage; as in the invention of the singular rhymed\r\noctosyllabic song—with its haunting refrain, _Eya velar!_—in the\r\n_Virgin's Lament_ (stanzas 170-198). This argues a considerable lyrical\r\ngift, and the pity is that the most of Berceo's editors should have\r\nbeen at such pains to hide it from the reader.\r\n\r\nIn the ten thousand lines of the _Libro de Alexandre_ are recounted\r\nthe imaginary adventures of the Macedonian king, as told in Gautier\r\nde Lille's _Alexandreis_ and in the versions of Lambert de Tort and\r\nAlexandre de Bernai. Traces of the Leonese dialect negative the\r\nascription to Berceo, and the Juan Lorenzo Segura de Astorga mentioned\r\nin the last verses is a mere copyist. The _Poema de Fernán González_,\r\ndue to a monk of San Pedro de Arlanza, embodies many picturesque and\r\nprimitive legends in Berceo's manner. But the value of both these\r\ncompositions is slight.\r\n\r\nSo much for verse. Castilian prose develops on parallel lines with\r\nit. A very early specimen is the didactic treatise called the _Diez\r\nMandamientos_, written by a Navarrese monk, at the beginning of the\r\nthirteenth century, for the use of confessors. Somewhat later follow\r\nthe _Anales Toledanos_, in two separate parts (the third is much more\r\nrecent), composed between the years 1220 and 1250. Rodrigo Jiménez\r\nde Rada, Archbishop of Toledo (1170-1247), wrote a Latin _Historia\r\nGothica_, which begins with the Gothic invasion, and ends at the year\r\n1243. Undertaken at the bidding of St. Ferdinand of Castile, this work\r\nwas summarised, and done into Castilian, probably by Jiménez de Rada\r\nhimself, under the title of the _Historia de los Godos_. Its date would\r\nbe the fourth decade of the thirteenth century, and to this same time\r\n(1241) belongs the _Fuero Juzgo_ (_Forum Judicum_). This is a Castilian\r\nversion of a code of so-called Gothic laws, substantially Roman in\r\norigin, given by St. Ferdinand (1200-1252) to the Spaniards settled in\r\nCórdoba and other southern cities after the reconquest; but though of\r\nextreme value to the philologer, its literary interest is too slight to\r\ndetain us here. Two most brilliant specimens of early Spanish prose\r\nare the letters supposed to have been written by the dying Alexander\r\nto his mother; and the accident of their being found in the manuscript\r\ncopied by Lorenzo Segura de Astorga has led to their being printed at\r\nthe end of the _Libro de Alexandre_. There is good reason for thinking\r\nthat they are not by the author of that poem; and, in truth, they\r\nare mere translations. Both letters are taken from _Hunain ibn Ishāk\r\nal-'Ibādī's_ Arabic collection of moral sentences; the first is found\r\nin the _Bonium_ (so called from its author, a mythical King of Persia),\r\nand the second on the Castilian version of the _Secretum Secretorum_,\r\nof which the very title is reproduced as _Poridat de las Poridades_.\r\nFurther examples of progressive prose are found in the _Libro de los\r\ndoce Sabios_, which deals with the political education of princes,\r\nand may have been drawn up by the direction of St. Ferdinand. But\r\nthe authorship and date of these compilations are little better than\r\nconjectural.\r\n\r\nThese are the preliminary essays in the stuff of Spanish prose. Its\r\npermanent form was received at the hands of ALFONSO THE LEARNED\r\n(1226-84), who followed his father, St. Ferdinand, to the Castilian\r\nthrone in 1252. Unlucky in his life, balked of his ambition to wear the\r\ntitle of Emperor, at war with Popes, his own brothers, his children,\r\nand his people, Alfonso has been hardly entreated after death.\r\nMariana, the greatest of Spanish historians, condenses the vulgar\r\nverdict in a Tacitean phrase: _Dum cœlum considerat terra amissit_.\r\nA mountain of libellous myth has overlaid Alfonso's fame. Of all the\r\nanecdotes concerning him, the best known is that which reports him\r\nas saying, \"Had God consulted me at the creation of the world, He\r\nwould have made it differently.\" This deliberate invention is due\r\nto Pedro IV. (the Ceremonious); and if Pedro foresaw the result,\r\nhe must have been a scoundrel of genius. Fortunately, nothing can\r\nrob Alfonso of his right to be considered, not only as the father of\r\nCastilian verse, but as the centre of all Spanish intellectual life.\r\nPolitical disaster never caused his intellectual activity to slacken.\r\nLike Bacon, he took all knowledge for his province, and in every\r\ndepartment he shone pre-eminent. Astronomy, music, philosophy, canon\r\nand civil law, history, poetry, the study of languages: he forced his\r\npeople upon these untrodden roads. To catalogue the series of his\r\nscientific enterprises, and to set down the names of his Jewish and\r\nArab collaborators, would give ample work to a bibliographer. Both the\r\n_Tablas Alfonsis_ and the colossal _Libros del Saber de Astronomía_\r\n(Books on the Science of Astronomy) are packed with minute corrections\r\nof Ptolemy, in whose system the learned King seems to have suspected\r\nan error; but their present interest lies in the historic fact, that\r\nwith their compilation Castilian makes its first great stride in the\r\ndirection of exactitude and clearness.\r\n\r\nSimilar qualities of precision and ease were developed in encyclopædic\r\ntreatises like the _Septenario_[3] which, together with the _Fuero\r\nJuzgo_, Alfonso drew up in his father's lifetime; and in practical\r\nguides such as the _Juegos de Açedrex, Dados, et Tablas_ (Book of\r\nChess, Dice, and Chequers). This miraculous activity astounded\r\ncontemporaries, and posterity has multiplied the wonder by attributing\r\nwell-nigh every possible anonymous work to the man whose real activity\r\nis a marvel. It has been sought to prove him the author of the _Libro\r\nde Alexandre_, the writer of Alexander's _Letters_, the compiler of\r\ntreatises on the chase, the translator of _Kalilah and Dimnah_, and\r\ninnumerable more pieces. Not one of these can be brought home to him,\r\nand some belong to a later time. Ticknor, again, foists on Alfonso two\r\nseparate works each entitled the _Tesoro_, and the authorship has been\r\naccepted upon that authority. It is therefore necessary to state the\r\nreal case. The one _Tesoro_ is a prose translation of Brunetto Latini's\r\n_Li Livres dou Trésor_ made by Alfonso de Paredes and Pero Gómez,\r\nrespectively surgeon and secretary at the court of Sancho, Alfonso's\r\nson and successor; the other _Tesoro_, with its prose preamble and\r\nforty-eight stanzas, is a forgery vamped by some parasite in the train\r\nof Alonso Carrillo, Archbishop of Toledo, during the fifteenth century.\r\n\r\nAlonso de Fuentes, writing three hundred years after Alfonso's death,\r\nnames him as author of a celebrated _romance_—\"_I left behind my\r\nnative land_\"; the rhythm and accentuation prove the lines to belong\r\nto a fifteenth-century maker whose attribution of them to the King is\r\npalpably dramatic. Great authorities accept as authentic the _Libro de\r\nQuerellas_ (Book of Plaints), which is represented by two fine stanzas\r\naddressed to Diego Sarmiento, \"brother and friend and vassal leal\" of\r\n\"him whose foot was kissed by kings, him from whom queens sought alms\r\nand grace.\" One is sorry to lose them, but they must be rejected. No\r\nsuch book is known to any contemporary; the twelve-syllabled octave in\r\nwhich the stanzas are written was not invented till a hundred years\r\nlater; and these two stanzas are simply fabrications by Pellicer, who\r\nfirst published them in the seventeenth century in his _Memoir on the\r\nHouse of Sarmiento_, with a view to flattering his patron.\r\n\r\nThis to some extent clears the ground: but not altogether. Setting\r\naside minor legal and philosophic treatises which Alfonso may have\r\nsupervised, it remains to speak of more important matters. A great\r\nachievement is the code called, from the number of its divisions, the\r\n_Siete Partidas_ (Seven Parts). This name does not appear to have been\r\nattached to the code till a hundred years after its compilation; but it\r\nmay be worth observing that the notion is implied in the name of the\r\n_Septenario_, and that Alfonso, regarding the number seven as something\r\nof mysterious potency, exhausts himself in citing precedents—the seven\r\ndays of the week, seven metals, seven arts, seven years that Jacob\r\nserved, seven lean years in Egypt, the seven-branched candlestick,\r\nseven sacraments, and so on. The trait is characteristic of the time.\r\nIt would be a grave mistake to suppose that the _Siete Partidas_ in\r\nany way resembles a modern book of statutes, couched in the technical\r\njargon of the law. Its primary object was the unification of the\r\nvarious clashing systems of law which Alfonso encountered within his\r\nunsettled kingdom; and this he accomplished with such success that all\r\nsubsequent Spanish legislation derives from the _Siete Partidas_, which\r\nare still to some extent in force in the republican states of Florida\r\nand Louisiana. But the design soon outgrows mere practical purpose,\r\nand expands into dissertations upon general principles and the pettier\r\ndetails of conduct.\r\n\r\nSancho Panza, as Governor of Barataria, could not have bettered the\r\ncounsels of the _Siete Partidas_, whose very titles force a smile:\r\n\"What things men should blush to confess, and what _not_,\" \"Why\r\nno monk should study law or physics,\" \"Why the King should abstain\r\nfrom low talk,\" \"Why the King should eat and drink moderately,\" \"Why\r\nthe King's children should be taught to be cleanly,\" \"How to draw\r\na will so that the witnesses shall not know its tenor,\" with other\r\nless prudish discussions. The reading of this code is not merely\r\ninstructive and curious; apart from its dry humouristic savour, the\r\n_Siete Partidas_ rises to a noble eloquence when the subject is the\r\ncommon weal, the office of the ruler, his relations to his people, and\r\nthe interdependence of Church and State. No man, by his single effort,\r\ncould draw a code of such intricacy and breadth, and it is established\r\nthat Jacobo Ruiz and Fernán Martínez laboured on it; but Alfonso's is\r\nthe supreme intelligence which appoints and governs, and his is the\r\nrevising hand which leaves the text in its perfect verbal form.\r\n\r\nIn history, too, Alfonso sought distinction; and he found it. The\r\n_Crónica_ or _Estoria de Espanna_, composed between the years 1260 and\r\n1268, the _General e grand Estoria_, begun in 1270, owe to him their\r\ninspiration. The latter, ranging from the Creation to Apostolic times,\r\nglances at such secular events as the Babylonian Empire and the fall\r\nof Troy; the former extends from the peopling of Europe by the sons of\r\nJaphet to the death of St. Ferdinand. Rodrigo Jiménez de Rada and Lucas\r\nde Tuy are the direct authorities, and their testimonies are completed\r\nby elaborate references that stretch from Pliny to the _cantares de\r\ngesta_. Moreover, the Arab chronicles are avowedly utilised in the\r\naccount of the Cid's exploits: \"thus says Abenfarax in his Arabic\r\nwhence this history is derived.\" A singular circumstance is the\r\ninferiority of style in these renderings from the Arabic. Elsewhere\r\na strange ignorance of Arabs and their history is shown by the\r\ncompiler's inclusion of such fables as Muhammad's crusade in Córdoba.\r\nThe inevitable conclusion is that the _Estorias_, like the _Siete\r\nPartidas_, are compilations by several hands; and the idea is supported\r\nby the fact that the prologue to the _Estoria de Espanna_ is scarcely\r\nmore than a translation of Jiménez de Rada's preface.\r\n\r\nLate traditions give the names of Alfonso's collaborators in one or\r\nthe other _History_ as Egidio de Zamora, Jofre de Loaysa, Martín de\r\nCórdoba, Suero Pérez, Bishop of Zamora, and Garci Fernández de Toledo;\r\nand even though these attributions be (as seems likely) a trifle\r\nfantastical, they at least indicate a long-standing disbelief in the\r\nunity of authorship. It is proved that Alfonso gathered from Córdoba,\r\nSeville, Toledo, and Paris some fifty experts to translate Ptolemy's\r\n_Quadri partitum_ and other astronomic treatises; it is natural that he\r\nshould organise a similar committee to put together the first history\r\nin the Castilian language. Better than most of his contemporaries,\r\nhe knew the value of combination. As with astronomy so with history:\r\nin both cases he conceived the scheme, in both cases he presided at\r\nthe redaction and stamped the crude stuff with his distinctive seal.\r\nJudged by a modern standard, both _Estorias_ lend themselves to a\r\ncheap ridicule; compared with their predecessors, they imply a finer\r\nappreciation of the value of testimony, and this notable evolution of\r\nthe critical sense is matched by a manner that rises to the theme. Side\r\nby side with a greater care for chronology, there is a keener edge of\r\npatriotism which leads the compilers to embody in their text whole\r\npassages of lost _cantares de gesta_. And these are no purple patches:\r\nthe expression is throughout dignified without pomp, and easy without\r\nfamiliarity. Spanish prose sheds much of its uncouthness, and takes\r\nits definitive form in such a passage as that upon the Joys of Spain:\r\n\"More than all, Spain is subtle,—ay! and terrible, right skilled in\r\nconflict, mirthful in labour, stanch to her lord, in letters studious,\r\nin speech courtly, fulfilled of gifts; never a land the earth overlong\r\nto match her excellence, to rival her bravery; few in the world as\r\nmighty as she.\" It may be lawful to believe that here we catch the\r\npersonal accent of the King.\r\n\r\nCompilations abound in which Alfonso is said to have shared, but they\r\nare of less importance than his _Cantigas de Santa María_ (Canticles\r\nof the Virgin)—four hundred and twenty pieces, written and set to\r\nmusic in the Virgin's praise. Strictly speaking, these do not belong to\r\nCastilian literature, being written in the elaborate Galician language,\r\nwhich now survives as little better than a dialect. But they must be\r\nconsidered if we are to form any just idea of Alfonso's accomplishments\r\nand versatility. At the outset a natural question suggests itself: \"Why\r\nshould the King of Castile, after drawing up his code in Castilian,\r\nwrite his verses in Galician?\" The answer is simple: \"For the reason\r\nthat he was an artist.\" Velázquez, indeed, asserts that Alfonso was\r\nreared in Galicia; but this is assertion, not evidence. The real motive\r\nof the choice was the superior development of the Galician, which so\r\nfar outpassed the Castilian in flexibility and grace as to invite\r\ncomparison with the Provençal. Troubadours in full flight from the\r\nAlbigensian wars found grace at Alfonso's court; Aimeric de Belenoi,\r\nNat de Mons, Calvo, Riquier, Lunel, and more.\r\n\r\nThat Alfonso wrote in Provençal seems probable enough, especially as\r\nhe derides the incapacity in this respect of his father's _trovador_,\r\nPero da Ponte; still, the two Provençal pieces which bear his name are\r\nspurious, and are the work of Nat de Mons and Riquier. Howbeit, the\r\nProvençal spell mastered him, and drove him to reproduce its elaborate\r\nrhythms. The first impression given by the _Cantigas_ is one of unusual\r\nmetrical resource. Verses of four syllables, of five, octosyllabics,\r\nhendecasyllabics, are among the singer's experiments. From the popular\r\n_coplas_, not unlike the modern _seguidillas_, he strays to the\r\nlumbering line of seventeen syllables; in five strophes he commits\r\nan acrostic as the name _María_; and half a thousand years before\r\nMatilda's lover went to Göttingen, he anticipates Canning's freak\r\nin the _Anti-Jacobin_ by splitting up a word to achieve a difficult\r\nrhyme; he abuses the refrain by insistent repetition, so as to give\r\nthe echo of a litany, or fit the ready-made melody of a _juglar_\r\n(clxxii.);—puerilities perhaps, but characteristic of a school and an\r\nepoch. Subjects are taken as they come, preference being given to the\r\nmore universal version, and local legends taking a secondary place.\r\nA living English poet has merited great praise for his _Ballad of a\r\nNun_. Six hundred years before Mr. Davidson, Alfonso gave six splendid\r\nvariants of the famous story. Two men of genius have treated the legend\r\nof the statue and the ring—Prosper Mérimée in his _Vénus d'Ille_, and\r\nHeine in _Les Dieux en Exile_—with splendid effect. Alfonso (xlii.)\r\nanticipated them by rendering the story in verses of incomparable\r\nbeauty, pregnant with mystery and terror.\r\n\r\nFor his part, Alfonso rifles Vincent de Beauvais, Gautier de Coinci,\r\nBerceo, and, in his encyclopædic way, borrows a hint from the old\r\nCatalan _Planctus Mariæ Virginis_; but his touch transmutes bold\r\nhagiology to measures of harmony and distinction. He was not—it\r\ncannot be claimed for him—a poet of supreme excellence; yet, if he\r\nfail to reach the topmost peaks, he vindicates his choice of a medium\r\nby outstripping his predecessors, and by pointing the path to those\r\nwho succeed him. With the brain of a giant he combined the heart of\r\na little child, and, technique apart, this amalgam which wrought his\r\npolitical ruin was his poetic salvation. Still an artist, even when\r\nhe stumbles into the ditch, his metrical dexterity persists in such\r\nbrutally erotic and satiric verse as he contributes to the Vatican\r\n_Cancioneiro_ (Nos. 61-79). Withal, he survives by something better\r\nthan mere virtuosity; for his simplicity and sincere enthusiasm,\r\nsundered from the prevalent affectation of his contemporaries, ensure\r\nhim a place apart.\r\n\r\nHis example in so many fields of intellectual exercise was followed.\r\nWhat part he took (if any) in preparing _Kalilah and Dimnah_ is not\r\nsettled. The Spanish version, probably made before Alfonso's accession\r\nto the throne, derives straight from the Arabic, which, in its turn,\r\nis rendered by Abd Allah ibn al-Mukaffa (754-775) from Barzoyeh's lost\r\nPehlevī (Old Persian) translations of the original Sanskrit. This\r\nlast has disappeared, though its substance survives in the remodelled\r\n_Panchatantra_, and from it descend the variants that are found in\r\nalmost all European literatures. The period of the Spanish rendering is\r\nhard to determine exactly, but 1251 is the generally accepted date, and\r\nits vogue is proved by the use made of it by Raimond de Béziers in his\r\nLatin version (1313). It does not appear to have been used by Raimond\r\nLull (1229-1315), the celebrated _Doctor illuminatus_, in his Catalan\r\nBeast-Romance, inserted in the _Libre de Maravelles_ about the year\r\n1286. The value of the Spanish lies in the excellence of the narrative\r\nmanner, and in its reduction of the oriental apologue to terms of the\r\nvernacular. Alfonso's brother, Fadrique, followed the lead in his\r\n_Engannos é Assayamientos de las Mogieres_ (Crafts and Wiles of Women),\r\nwhich is referred to 1253, and is translated from the Arabic version of\r\na lost Sanskrit original, after the fashion of _Kalilah and Dimnah_.\r\n\r\nTranslation is continued at the court of Alfonso's son and successor,\r\nSANCHO IV. (d. 1295), who, as already noted, commands a version of\r\nBrunetto Latini's _Tesoro_; and the encyclopædic mania takes shape\r\nin a work entitled the _Luçidario_, a series of one hundred and six\r\nchapters, which begins by discussing \"What was the first thing in\r\nheaven and earth?\" and ends with reflections on the habits of animals\r\nand the whiteness of negroes' teeth. The _Gran Conquista de Ultramar_\r\n(Great Conquest Oversea) is a perversion of the history originally\r\ngiven by Guillaume de Tyr (d. 1184), mixed with other fabulous\r\nelements, derived perhaps from the French, and certainly from the\r\nProvençal, which thus comes for the first time in direct contact with\r\nCastilian prose. The fragmentary Provençal _Chanson d'Antioche_ which\r\nremains can scarcely be the original form in which it was composed by\r\nits alleged author, Grégoire de Bechada: at best it is a _rifacimento_\r\nof a previous draught. But that it was used by the Spanish translator\r\nhas been amply demonstrated by M. Gaston Paris. The translator has been\r\nidentified with King Sancho himself; the safer opinion is that the work\r\nwas undertaken by his order during his last days, and was finished\r\nafter his death.\r\n\r\nWith these should be classed compilations like the _Book of Good\r\nProverbs_, translated from Hunain ibn Ishāk al-'Ibādī; the _Bonium_\r\nor _Bocados de Oro_, from the collections of Abu 'l Wafā Mubashshir\r\nibn Fātik, part of which was Englished by Lord Rivers, and thence\r\nconveyed into Caxton's _Dictes and Sayings of the Philosophers_; and\r\nthe _Flowers of Philosophy_, a treatise composed of thirty-eight\r\nchapters of fictitious moral sentences uttered by a tribe of thinkers,\r\nculminating—fitly enough for a Spanish book—in Seneca of Córdoba.\r\nIn dealing with these works it is impossible to speak precisely as to\r\nsource and date: the probability is that they were put together during\r\nthe reign of Sancho, who was his father's son in more than the literal\r\nsense. Like Alfonso's, his ambition was to force his people into the\r\nintellectual current of the age, and in default of native masterpieces\r\nhe supplied them with foreign models whence the desired masterpieces\r\nmight proceed; and, like his father, Sancho himself entered the lists\r\nwith his _Castigos y Documentos_ (Admonitions and Exhortations),\r\nninety chapters designed for the guidance of his son. This production,\r\ndisfigured by the ostentatious erudition of the Middle Ages, is saved\r\nfrom death by its shrewd common-sense, by its practical counsel, and\r\nby the admirable purity and lucidity of style that formed the most\r\nvaluable asset in Sancho's heritage. With him the literature of the\r\nthirteenth century comes to a dramatic close: the turbulent fighter,\r\nwhose rebellion cut short his father's days, becomes the conscientious\r\npromoter of his father's literary tradition.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[3] So called because it embraced the seven subjects of learning: the\r\n_trivio_ (grammar, logic, and rhetoric), and the _quadrivio_ (music,\r\nastrology, physics, and metaphysics).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER IV\r\n\r\n                           THE DIDACTIC AGE\r\n\r\n                               1301-1400\r\n\r\n\r\nOnly the barest mention need be made of a \"clerkly poem\" called the\r\n_Vida de San Ildefonso_ (Life of St. Ildephonsus), a dry narrative\r\nof over a thousand lines, probably written soon after 1313, when the\r\nsaint's feast was instituted by the Council of Peñafiel. Its author\r\ndeclares that he once held the prebend of Úbeda, and that he had\r\npreviously rhymed the history of the Magdalen. No other information\r\nconcerning him exists; nor is it eagerly sought, for the Prebendary's\r\npoem is a colourless imitation of Berceo, without Berceo's visitings of\r\ninspiration. More merit is shown in the _Proverbios en Rimo de Salomón_\r\n(Solomon's Rhymed Proverbs), moralisings on the vanity of life,\r\nwritten, with many variations, in the manner of Berceo. The author of\r\nthese didactic, satiric verses is announced in the oldest manuscript\r\ncopy as one Pero Gómez, son of Juan Fernández. He has been absurdly\r\nconfounded with an ancient \"Gómez, _trovador_,\" and, more plausibly,\r\nwith the Pero Gómez who collaborated with Paredes in translating\r\nBrunetto Latini's _Tesoro_; but the name is too common to allow of\r\nprecise opinion as to the real author, whom some have taken for Pero\r\nLópez de Ayala. Whoever the writer, he possessed a pleasant gift of\r\nsatirical observation, and a knowledge of men and affairs which he puts\r\nto good use, with few lapses upon the merely trite and banal.\r\n\r\nOf more singular interest is the incomplete _Poema de José_ or\r\n_Historia de Yusuf_, named by the writer, _Al-hadits de Jusuf_. This\r\ncurious monument, due doubtless to some unconverted Mudéjar of Toledo,\r\nis the typical example of the literature called _aljamiada_. The\r\nlanguage is correct Castilian of the time, and the metre, sustained for\r\n312 stanzas, is the right Bercean: the peculiarity lies in the use of\r\nArabic characters in the phonetic transcription. A considerable mass\r\nof such compositions has been discovered (and in the discovery England\r\nhas taken part); but of them all the _Historia de Yusuf_ is at once\r\nthe best and earliest. It deals with the story of Joseph in Egypt, not\r\naccording to the Old Testament narrative, but in general conformity\r\nwith the version found in the eleventh _sura_ of the Ku'rān, though\r\nthe writer does not hesitate to introduce variants and amplifications\r\nof his own invention, as (stanza 31) when the wolf speaks to the\r\npatriarch whose son it is supposed to have slain. The persecution\r\nof Joseph by Potiphar's wife, who figures as Zulija (Zuleikah), is\r\ntold with considerable spirit, and the mastery of the _cuaderna vía_\r\n(the Bercean metre of four fourteen-syllabled lines rhymed together)\r\nis little short of amazing in a foreigner. At whiles an Arabic word\r\ncreeps into the text, and the invocation of Allah, with which the poem\r\nopens, is repeated in later stanzas; but, taken as a whole, apart from\r\nthe oriental colouring inseparable from the theme, there is a marked\r\nsimilarity of tone between the _Historia de Yusuf_ and its predecessors\r\nthe \"clerkly poems.\" An oriental subject handled by an Arab gave the\r\nbest possible opportunity for introducing orientalism in the treatment;\r\nthe occasion is eschewed, and the lettered Arab studiously follows in\r\nthe wake of Berceo and the other Castilian models known to him. There\r\ncould scarcely be more striking evidence of the irresistible progress\r\nof Castilian modes of thought and expression. The Arabic influence, if\r\nit ever existed, was already dead.\r\n\r\nJUAN RUIZ, Archpriest of Hita, near Guadalajara, is the greatest name\r\nin early Castilian literature. The dates of his birth and death are\r\nnot known. A line in his _Libro de Cantares_ (stanza 1484) inclines us\r\nto believe that, like Cervantes, he was a native of Alcalá de Henares;\r\nbut Guadalajara also claims him for her own, and a certain Francisco\r\nde Torres reports him as living there so late as 1415. This date is\r\nincompatible with other ascertained facts in Ruiz' career. We learn\r\nfrom a note at the end of his poems that \"this is the book of the\r\nArchpriest of Hita, which he wrote, being imprisoned by order of the\r\nCardinal Don Gil, Archbishop of Toledo.\" Now, Gil Albornoz held the\r\nsee between the years 1337 and 1367; and another clerk, named Pedro\r\nFernández, was Archpriest of Hita in 1351. Most likely Juan Ruiz was\r\nborn at the close of the thirteenth century, and died, very possibly\r\nin gaol, before his successor was appointed. On the showing of his\r\nown writings, Juan Ruiz was a cleric of irregular life at a time when\r\ndisorder was at its worst, and his thirteen years in prison proclaim\r\nhim a Goliard of the loosest kind. He testifies against himself with\r\na splendid candour; and yet there have been critics who insisted on\r\nidealising this libidinous clerk into a smug Boanerges. There was\r\nnever a more grotesque travesty, a more purblind misunderstanding of\r\nfacts and the man.\r\n\r\nThe Archpriest was a fellow of parts and of infinite fancy. He\r\ndoes, indeed, allege that he supplies, \"incentives to good conduct,\r\ninjunctions towards salvation, to be understanded of the people and\r\nto enable folk to guard against the trickeries which some practise in\r\npursuit of foolish loves.\" He comes pat with a text from Scripture\r\nquoted for his own purpose:—\"_Intellectum tibi dabo, et instruam te in\r\nvia hac, qua gradieris._\" He passes from David to Solomon, and, with\r\nhis tongue in his cheek, transcribes his versicle:—\"_Initium sapientiæ\r\ntimor Domini._\" St. John, Job, Cato, St. Gregory, the Decretals—he\r\ncalls them all into court to witness his respectable intention, and at\r\na few lines' distance he unmasks in a passage which prudish editors\r\nhave suppressed:—\"Yet, since it is human to sin, if any choose\r\nthe ways of love (which I do not recommend), the modes thereof are\r\nrecounted here;\" and so forth, in detail the reverse of edifying.\r\nOvid's erotic verses are freely rendered, the Archpriest's unsuccessful\r\nbattle against love is told, and the liturgy is burlesqued in the\r\nprocession of \"clerks and laymen and monks and nuns and duennas and\r\ngleemen to welcome love into Toledo.\" The attempt to exhibit Ruiz as an\r\nedifying citizen is, on the face of it, absurd.\r\n\r\nMuch that he wrote is lost, but the seventeen hundred stanzas that\r\nremain suffice for any reputation. Juan Ruiz strikes the personal\r\nnote in Castilian literature. To distinguish the works of the clerkly\r\nmasters, to declare with certainty that this Castilian piece was\r\nwritten by Alfonso and that by Sancho, is a difficult and hazardous\r\nmatter. Not so with Ruiz. The stamp of his personality is unmistakable\r\nin every line. He was bred in the old tradition, and he long abides\r\nby the rules of the _mester de clerecía_; but he handles it with a\r\nfreedom unknown before, imparts to it a new flexibility, a variety, a\r\nspeed, a music beyond all precedent, and transfuses it with a humour\r\nwhich anticipates Cervantes. Nay, he does more. In his prose preface he\r\nasserts that he chiefly sought to give examples of prosody, of rhyme\r\nand composition:—\"_Dar algunas lecciones, é muestra de versificar,\r\net rimar et trobar._\" And he followed the bent of his natural genius.\r\nHe had an infinitely wider culture than any of his predecessors in\r\nverse. All that they knew he knew—and more; and he treated them in\r\nthe true cavalier spirit of the man who feels himself a master. His\r\nfamous description of the tent of love is manifestly suggested by the\r\ndescription of Alexander's tent in the _Libro de Alexandre_. The entire\r\nepisode of Doña Endrina is paraphrased from the _Liber de Amore_,\r\nattributed to the Pseudo-Ovid, the Auvergnat monk who hides beneath the\r\nname of Pamphilus Maurilianus.\r\n\r\nFrench _fableaux_ were rifled by Ruiz without a scruple, though he\r\nhad access to their great originals in the _Disciplina clericalis_ of\r\nPetrus Alphonsus; for to his mind the improved treatment was of greater\r\nworth than the mere bald story. He was familiar with the _Kalilah and\r\nDimnah_, with Fadrique's _Crafts and Wiles of Women_, perhaps with the\r\napologues of Lull and Juan Manuel. Vast as his reading was, it had\r\navailed him nothing without his superb temperament, his gift of using\r\nit to effect. Vaster still was his knowledge of men, his acquaintance\r\nwith the seamy side of life, his interest in things common and rare,\r\nhis observation of manners, and his lyrical endowment. The name of \"the\r\nSpanish Petronius\" has been given to him; yet, despite a superficial\r\nresemblance between the two, it is a misnomer. Far nearer the truth,\r\nthough the Spaniard lacks the dignity of the Englishman, is Ticknor's\r\nparallel with Chaucer. Like Chaucer, Ruiz had an almost incomparable\r\ngust for life, an immitigable gaiety of spirit, which penetrates his\r\ntranscription of the Human Comedy. Like Chaucer, his adventurous\r\ncuriosity led him to burst the bonds of the prison-house and to\r\nconfer upon his country new rhythms and metres. His four _cánticas de\r\nserrana_, suggested by the Galician makers, anticipate by a hundred\r\nyears the _serranillas_ and the _vaqueiras_ of Santillana, and entitle\r\nhim to rank as the first great lyric poet of Castile. Ruiz, likewise,\r\nhad a Legend of Women; but his reading was his own, and Chaucer's\r\nadjective cannot be applied to it. His ambition is, not to idealise,\r\nbut to realise existence, and he interprets its sensuous animalism in\r\nthe spirit of picaresque enjoyment. Jewesses, Moorish dancers, the\r\nprocuress _Trota-conventos_, her finicking customers, the loose nuns,\r\ngreat ladies, and brawny daughters of the plough,—Ruiz renders them\r\nwith the merciless exactitude of Velázquez.\r\n\r\nThe arrangement of Ruiz' verse, disorderly as his life, foreshadows the\r\nloose construction of the picaresque novel, of which his own work may\r\nbe considered the first example. One of his greatest discoveries is the\r\nrare value of the autobiographic form. Mingled with parodies of hymns,\r\nwith burlesques of old _cantares de gesta_, with glorified paraphrases\r\nof both Ovids (the true and the false), with versions of oriental\r\nfables read in books or gathered from the lips of vagrant Arabs, with\r\npeculiar wealth of popular refrains and proverbs—with these goes the\r\ntale of the writer's individual life, rich in self-mockery, gross in\r\nthought, abundant in incident, splendid in expression, slyly edifying\r\nin the moral conclusion which announces an immediate relapse. Poet,\r\nnovelist, expert in observation, irony, and travesty, Ruiz had,\r\nmoreover, the sense of style in such measure as none before him and\r\nfew after him, and to this innate faculty of selection he joined a\r\ngreat capacity for dramatic creation. Hence the impossibility of\r\nexhibiting him in elegant extracts, and hence the permanence of his\r\ntypes. The most familiar figure of _Lazarillo de Tormes_—the starving\r\ngentleman—is a lineal descendant of Ruiz' Don Furón, who is scrupulous\r\nin observing facts so long as there is nothing to eat; and Ruiz' two\r\nlovers, Melón de la Uerta and Endrina de Calatayud, are transferred\r\nas Calisto and Melibea to Rojas' tragi-comedy, whence they pass into\r\nimmortality as Romeo and Juliet. Lastly, Ruiz' repute might be staked\r\nupon his fables, which, by their ironic appreciation, their playful\r\nwit and humour, seem to proceed from an earlier, ruder, more virile La\r\nFontaine.\r\n\r\nContemporary with Juan Ruiz was the Infante JUAN MANUEL (1282-1347),\r\ngrandson of St. Ferdinand and nephew of Alfonso the Learned. In his\r\ntwelfth year he served against the Moors on the Murcian frontier,\r\nbecame Mayordomo to Fernando IV., and succeeded to the regency\r\nshortly after that King's death in 1312. Mariana's denunciation of\r\n\"him who seemed born solely to wreck the state\" fits Juan Manuel so\r\nexactly that it is commonly applied to him; but, in truth, its author\r\nintended it for another Don Juan (without the \"Manuel\"), uncle of\r\nthe boy-king, Alfonso XI. Upon the regency followed a spell of wars,\r\nbroils, rebellions, assassinations, wherein King and ex-Regent were\r\npitted against each other. Neither King nor soldier bore malice, and\r\nthe latter shared in the decisive victory of Salado and—perhaps with\r\nChaucer's Gentle Knight—in the siege of Algezir (_Algeciras_). Fifty\r\nyears of battle would fill most men's lives; but the love of literature\r\nran in the blood of Juan Manuel's veins, and, like others of his\r\nkindred, he proved the truth of the old Castilian adage:—\"Lance never\r\nblunted pen, nor pen lance.\"\r\n\r\nHe set a proper value on himself and his achievement. In the General\r\nIntroduction to his works he foresees, so he announces, that his books\r\nmust be often copied, and he knows that this means error:—\"as I have\r\nseen happen in other copies, either because of the transcriber's\r\ndulness, or because the letters are much alike.\" Wherefore Juan\r\nManuel prepared, so to say, a copyright edition, with a prefatory\r\nbibliography, whose deficiencies may be supplemented by a second list\r\ngiven at the beginning of his _Conde Lucanor_. And he closes his\r\nGeneral Introduction with this prayer:—\"And I beg all those who may\r\nread any of the books I made not to blame me for whatever ill-written\r\nthing they find, until they see it in this volume which I myself have\r\narranged.\" His care seemed excessive: it proved really insufficient,\r\nsince the complete edition which he left to the monastery at Peñafiel\r\nhas disappeared. Some of his works are lost to us, as the _Book of\r\nChivalry_,[4] a treatise dealing with the _Engines of War_, a _Book\r\nof Verses_, the _Art of Poetic Composition_ (_Reglas como se debe\r\nTrovar_), and the _Book of Sages_. The loss of the _Book of Verses_ is\r\na real calamity; all the more that it existed at Peñafiel as recently\r\nas the time of Argote de Molina (1549-90), who meant to publish it.\r\nJuan Manuel's couplets and quatrains of four, eight, eleven, twelve,\r\nand fourteen syllables, his arrangement (_Enxemplo XVI._) of the\r\noctosyllabic _redondilla_ in the _Conde Lucanor_, prove him an adept\r\nin the Galician form, an irreproachable virtuoso in his art. It seems\r\nalmost certain that his _Book of Verses_ included many remarkable\r\nexercises in political satire; and, in any case, his example and\r\nposition must have greatly influenced the development of the courtly\r\nschool of poets at Juan II.'s court.\r\n\r\nA treatise like his _Libro de Caza_ (Book of Hawking), recently\r\nrecovered by Professor Baist, needs but to be mentioned to indicate\r\nits aim. His histories are mere epitomes of Alfonso's chronicle. The\r\n_Libro del Caballero et del Escudero_ (Book of the Knight and Squire),\r\nin fifty-one chapters, of which some thirteen are missing, is a\r\ndidacticism, a _fabliella_, modelled upon Ramón Lull's _Libre del Orde\r\nde Cavallería_. A hermit who has abandoned war instructs an ambitious\r\nsquire in the virtues of chivalry, and sends him to court, whence he\r\nreturns \"with much wealth and honour.\" The inquiry begins anew, and the\r\nhermit expounds to his companion the nature of angels, paradise, hell,\r\nthe heavens, the elements, the art of posing questions, the stuff of\r\nthe planets, sea, earth, and all that is therein—birds, fish, plants,\r\ntrees, stones, and metals. In some sort the _Tratado sobre las Armas_\r\n(Treatise on Arms) is a memoir of the writer's house, containing a\r\npowerful presentation of the death of Juan Manuel's guardian, King\r\nSancho, passing to eternity beneath his father's curse.\r\n\r\nJuan Manuel follows Sancho's example by preparing twenty-six chapters\r\nof _Castigos_ (Exhortations), sometimes called the _Libro infinido_, or\r\nUnfinished Book, addressed to his son, a boy of nine. He reproduces\r\nSancho's excellent manner and sound practical advice without the\r\nflaunting erudition of his cousin. The _Castigos_ are suspended to\r\nsupply the monk, Juan Alfonso, with a treatise on the _Modes of\r\nLove_, fifteen in number; being, in fact, an ingenious discussion on\r\nfriendship. Juan Manuel is seen almost at his best in his _Libro de\r\nlos Estados_ (Book of States), otherwise the _Book of the Infante_,\r\nand thought by some to be the missing _Book of Sages_. The allegorical\r\ndidactic vein is worked to exhaustion in one hundred and fifty\r\nchapters, which relate the education of the pagan Morován's son, Johas,\r\nby a certain Turín, who, unable to satisfy his pupil, calls to his\r\naid the celebrated preacher Julio. After interminable discussions and\r\nresolutions of theological difficulties, the story ends in the baptism\r\nof father, son, and tutor. Gayangos gives us the key; Johas is Juan\r\nManuel; Morován is his father, Manuel; Turín is Pero López de Ayala,\r\ngrandfather of the future Chancellor; and Julio represents St. Dominic\r\n(who, as a matter of fact, died before Juan Manuel's father was born).\r\nThis confused philosophic story, suggestive of the legend of Barlaam\r\nand Josaphat, is in truth the vehicle for conveying the author's ideas\r\non every sort of question, and it might be described without injustice\r\nas the carefully revised commonplace book of an omnivorous reader with\r\na care for form. A postscript to the _Book of States_ is the _Book of\r\nPreaching Friars_, a summary of the Dominican constitution expounded\r\nby Julio to his pupil. A very similar dissertation is the _Treatise\r\nshowing that the Blessed Mary is, body and soul, in Paradise_, directed\r\nto Remón Masquefa, Prior of Peñafiel.\r\n\r\nJuan Manuel's masterpiece is the _Conde Lucanor_ (also named the _Book\r\nof Patronio_ and the _Book of Examples_), in four parts, the first\r\nof which is divided into fifty-one chapters. Like the _Decamerone_,\r\nlike the _Canterbury Tales_—but with greater directness—the _Conde\r\nLucanor_ is the oriental apologue embellished in terms of the\r\nvernacular. The convention of the \"moral lesson\" is maintained, and\r\neach chapter of the First Part (the others are rather unfinished notes)\r\nends with a declaration to the effect that \"when Don Johan heard this\r\nexample he found it good, ordered it to be set down in this book,\r\nand added these verses\"—the verses being a concise summary of the\r\nprose. The _Conde Lucanor_ is the Spanish equivalent of the _Arabian\r\nNights_, with Patronio in the part of Scheherazade, and Count Lucanor\r\n(as who should say Juan Manuel) as the Caliph. Boccaccio used the\r\nframework first in Italy, but Juan Manuel was before him by six years,\r\nfor the _Conde Lucanor_ was written not later than 1342. The examples\r\nare taken from experience, and are told with extraordinary narrative\r\nskill. Simplicity of theme is matched by simplicity of expression. The\r\nstory of father and son (_Enxemplo II._), of the Dean of Santiago and\r\nthe Toledan Magician (_Enxemplo XI._), of Ferrant González and Nuño\r\nLaynez, a model of dramatic presentation (_Enxemplo XVI._), are perfect\r\nmasterpieces in little.\r\n\r\nJuan Manuel is an innovator in Castilian prose, as is Juan Ruiz\r\nin Castilian verse. He lacks the merriment, the genial wit of the\r\nArchpriest; but he has the same gift of irony, with an added note of\r\ncutting sarcasm, and a more anxious research for the right word. He\r\nnever forgets that he has been the Regent of Castile, that he has\r\nmingled with kings and queens, that he has cowed emirs and barons, and\r\nled his troopers at the charge; and it is well that he never unbends,\r\nsince his unsmiling patrician humour gives each story a keener point.\r\nIn mind as in blood he is the great Alfonso's kinsman, and the relation\r\nbecomes evident in his treatment of the prose sentence. He inherited\r\nit with many another splendid tradition, and, while he preserves\r\nentire its stately clearness, he polishes to concision; he sets with\r\nconscience to the work, sharpening the edges of his instrument,\r\nexhibits its possibilities in the way of trenchancy, and puts it to\r\nsubtler uses than heretofore. In his hands Castilian prose acquires a\r\nnew ductility and finish, and his subjects are such that dramatists of\r\ngenius have stooped to borrow from him. In him (_Enxemplo XLV._) is the\r\ngerm of the _Taming of the Shrew_ (though it is scarcely credible that\r\nShakespeare lifted it direct), and from him Calderón takes not merely\r\nthe title—_Count Lucanor_—of a play, but the famous apologue in the\r\nfirst act of _Life is a Dream_, an adaptation to the stage of one of\r\nJuan Manuel's best instances (_Enxemplo XXXI._). Pilferings by Le Sage\r\nare things of course, and _Gil Blas_ benefits by its author's reading.\r\nTranslations apart—and they are forthcoming—the _Conde Lucanor_\r\nis one of the books of the world, and each reading of it makes more\r\nsensible the loss of the verses which, one would fain believe, might\r\nplace the writer as high among poets as among prose writers.\r\n\r\nThe _Poema de Alfonso Onceno_, also known as his _Rhymed Chronicle_,\r\nwas unearthed at Granada in 1573 by Diego Hurtado de Mendoza, and an\r\nextract from it, printed fifteen years later by Argote de Molina,\r\nencouraged the idea that Alfonso XI. wrote it. That King's sole exploit\r\nin literature is a handbook on venery, often attributed to Alfonso the\r\nLearned. The fuller, but still incomplete text of the _Poema_, first\r\npublished in 1864, discloses (stanza 1841) the author's name as RODRIGO\r\nYAÑEZ or Yannes. It is to be noted that he speaks of rendering Merlin's\r\nprophecy in the Castilian tongue:—\r\n\r\n  \"_Yo Rodrigo Yannes la noté\r\n  En lenguaje castellano._\"\r\n\r\nEverything points to his having translated from a Galician original,\r\nbeing himself a Galician who hispaniolised his name of Rodrigo Eannes.\r\nStrong arguments in favour of this theory are advanced by great\r\nauthorities—Professor Cornu, and that most learned lady, Mme. Carolina\r\nMichaëlis de Vasconcellos. In the first place, the many technical\r\ndefects of the _Poema_ vanish upon translation into Galician; and\r\nnext, the verses are laced with allusions to Merlin, which indicate a\r\nfamiliarity with Breton legends, common enough in Galicia and Portugal,\r\nbut absolutely unknown in Spain. Be that as it prove, the _Poema_\r\ninterests as the last expression of the old Castilian epic. Here we\r\nhave, literally, the swan-song of the man-at-arms, chanting the battles\r\nin which he shared, commemorating the names of comrades foremost in\r\nthe van, reproducing the martial music of the camp _juglar_, observing\r\nthe set conventions of the _cantares de gesta_. His last appearance\r\non any stage is marked by a portent—the suppression of the tedious\r\nAlexandrine, and the resolution into two lines of the sixteen-syllabled\r\nverse. Yañez is an excellent instance of the third-rate man, the\r\namateur, who embodies, if he does not initiate, a revolution. His own\r\nsystem of octosyllabics in alternate rhymes has a sing-song monotony\r\nwhich wearies by its facile copiousness, and inspiration visits him at\r\nrare and distant intervals. But the step that costs is taken, and a\r\nplace is prepared for the young _romance_ in literature.\r\n\r\nNo precise information offers concerning Rabbi SEM TOB of Carrión,\r\nthe first Jew who writes at length in Castilian. His dedication to\r\nPedro the Cruel, who reigned from 1350 to 1369, enables us to fix\r\nhis date approximately, and to guess that he was, like others of his\r\nrace, a favourite with that maligned ruler. Written in the early\r\ndays of the new reign, Sem Tob's _Proverbios Morales_, consisting of\r\n686 seven-syllabled quatrains, are more than a metrical novelty. His\r\ncollection of sententious maxims, borrowed mainly from Arabic sources\r\nand from the Bible, is the first instance in Castilian of the versified\r\nepigram which was to produce the brilliant _Proverbs_ of Santillana,\r\nwho praises the Rabbi as a writer of \"very good things,\" and reports\r\nhis esteem as a \"_grand trovador_.\" In Santillana's hands the maxims\r\nare Spanish, are European; in Sem Tob's they are Jewish, oriental. The\r\nmoral is pressed with insistence, the presentation is haphazard; while\r\nthe extreme concision of thought, the exaggerated frugality of words,\r\ntends to obscurity. Against this is to be set the exalted standard\r\nof the teaching, the daring figures of the writer, his happiness of\r\nepithet, his note of austere melancholy, and his complete triumph in\r\nnaturalising a new poetic _genre_.\r\n\r\nIt has been sought to father on Sem Tob three other pieces: the\r\n_Treatise of Doctrine_, the _Revelation of a Hermit_, and the _Danza de\r\nla Muerte_. The _Treatise_, a catechism in octosyllabic triplets with\r\na four-syllabled line, is by Pedro de Berague, and is only curious for\r\nits rhythm, imitated from the _rime couée_, and for being the first\r\nwork of its kind. Sem Tob was in his grave when the ancient subject\r\nof the _Argument between Body and Soul_ was reintroduced by the maker\r\nof the _Revelation of a Hermit_, wherein the souls are figured as\r\nbirds, gracious or hideous as the case may be. The third line of this\r\ndidactic poem gives its date as 1382, and this is confirmed by the\r\nevidence of the metre and the presence of an Italian savour. In the\r\ncase of the anonymous _Danza de la Muerte_ the metre once more fixes\r\nthe period of composition at about the end of the fourteenth century.\r\nMost European literatures possess a _Danse Macabré_ of their own; yet,\r\nthough the Castilian is probably an imitation of some unrecognised\r\nFrench original, it is the oldest known version of the legend. It is\r\nnot rash to assume that its immediate occasion was the last terrific\r\noutbreak of the Black Death, which lasted from 1394 to 1399. Death\r\nbids mankind to his revels, and forces them to join his dance. The\r\nform is superficially dramatic, and the thirty-three victims—pope,\r\nemperor, cardinal, king, and so forth, a cleric and a layman always\r\nalternating—reply to the summons in a series of octaves. Whoever\r\ncomposed the Spanish version, he must be accepted as an expert in the\r\nart of morbid allegory. Odd to say, the Catalan Carbonell, constructing\r\nhis _Dance of Death_ in the sixteenth century, rejects this fine\r\nCastilian version for the French of Jean de Limoges, Chancellor of\r\nParis.\r\n\r\nA writer who represents the stages of the literary evolution of his\r\nage is the long-lived Chancellor, PERO LÓPEZ DE AYALA (1332-1407). His\r\ncareer is a veritable romance of feudalism. Living under Alfonso XI.,\r\nhe became the favourite of Pedro the Cruel, whom he deserted at the\r\npsychological moment. He chronicles his own and his father's defection\r\nin such terms as Pepys or the Vicar of Bray might use:—\"They saw that\r\nDon Pedro's affairs were all awry, so they resolved to leave him, not\r\nintending to return.\" Pedro the Cruel, Enrique II., Juan I., Enrique\r\nIII.—Ayala served all four with profit to his pouch, without flagrant\r\ntreason. Loyalty he held for a vain thing compared with interest; yet\r\nhe earned his money and his lands in fight. He ever strove to be on the\r\nwinning side, but luck was hostile when the Black Prince captured him\r\nat Nájera (1367), and when he was taken prisoner at Aljubarrota (1385).\r\nThe fifteen months spent in an iron cage at the castle of Oviedes after\r\nthe second defeat gave Ayala one of his opportunities. He had wasted no\r\nchance in life, nor did he now. It were pleasant to think with Ticknor\r\nthat some part of Ayala's _Rimado de Palacio_ \"was written during his\r\nimprisonment in England,\"—pleasant, but difficult. To begin with,\r\nit is by no means sure that Ayala ever quitted the Peninsula. More\r\nthan this: though the _Rimado de Palacio_ was composed at intervals,\r\nthe stages can be dated approximately. The earlier part of the poem\r\ncontains an allusion to the schism during the pontificate of Urban VI.,\r\nso that this passage must date from 1378 or afterwards; the reference\r\nto the death of the poet's father, Hernán Pérez de Ayala, brings us to\r\nthe year 1385 or later; and the statement that the schism had lasted\r\ntwenty-five years fixes the time of composition as 1403.\r\n\r\n_Rimado de Palacio_ (Court Rhymes) is a chance title that has attached\r\nitself to Ayala's poem without the author's sanction. It gives a false\r\nimpression of his theme, which is the decadence of his age. Only within\r\nnarrow limits does Ayala deal with courts and courtiers; he had a wider\r\noutlook, and he scourges society at large. What was a jest to Ruiz was\r\na woe to the Chancellor. Ruiz had a natural sympathy for a loose-living\r\ncleric; Ayala lashes this sort with a thong steeped in vitriol. The\r\none looks at life as a farce; the other sees it as a tragedy. Where\r\nthe first finds matter for merriment, the second burns with the white\r\nindignation of the just. The deliberate mordancy of Ayala is impartial\r\ninsomuch as it is universal. Courtiers, statesmen, bishops, lawyers,\r\nmerchants—he brands them all with corruption, simony, embezzlement,\r\nand exposes them as venal sons of Belial. And, like Ruiz, he places\r\nhimself in the pillory to heighten his effects. He spares not his\r\nsuperstitious belief in omens, dreams, and such-like fooleries; he\r\ndiscovers himself as a grinder of the poor man's face, a libidinous\r\nperjurer, a child of perdition.\r\n\r\nBut not all Ayala's poem is given up to cursing. In his 705th stanza\r\nhe closes what he calls his _sermón_ with the confession that he had\r\nwritten it, \"being sore afflicted by many grievous sorrows,\" and in the\r\nremaining 904 stanzas Ayala breathes a serener air. In both existing\r\ncodices—that of Campo-Alange and that of the Escorial—this huge\r\npostscript follows the _Rimado de Palacio_ with no apparent break of\r\ncontinuity; yet it differs in form and substance from what precedes.\r\nThe _cuaderna vía_ alone is used in the satiric and autobiographical\r\nverses; the later hymns and songs are metrical experiments—echoes of\r\nGalician and Provençal measures, _redondillas_ of seven syllables,\r\nattempts to raise the Alexandrine from the dead, results derived from\r\nAlfonso's _Cantigas_ and Juan Ruiz' _loores_. In his seventy-third\r\nyear Ayala was still working upon his _Rimado de Palacio_. It was\r\ntoo late for him to master the new methods creeping into vogue, and\r\nthough in the _Cancionero de Baena_ (No. 518) Ayala answers Sánchez\r\nTalavera's challenge in the regulation octaves, he harks back to the\r\n_cuaderna vía_ of his youth in his paraphrase of St. Gregory's _Job_.\r\nIf he be the writer of the _Proverbios en Rimo de Salomón_—a doubtful\r\npoint—his preference for the old system is there undisguised. Could\r\nthat system have been saved, Ayala had saved it: not even he could stay\r\nthe world from moving.\r\n\r\nHis prose is at least as distinguished as his verse. A treatise\r\non falconry, rich in rarities of speech, shows the variety of his\r\ninterests, and his version of Boccaccio's _De Casibus Virorum\r\nillustrium_ brings him into touch with the conquering Italian\r\ninfluence. His reference to _Amadís_ in the _Rimado de Palacio_ (stanza\r\n162), the first mention of that knight-errantry of Spain, proves\r\nacquaintance with new models. Translations of Boëtius and of St.\r\nIsidore were pastimes; a partial rendering of Livy, done at the King's\r\ncommand, was of greater value. In person or by proxy, Alfonso the\r\nLearned had opened up the land of history; Juan Manuel had summarised\r\nhis uncle's work; the chronicle of the Moor Rasis, otherwise Abu Bakr\r\nAhmad ibn Muhammad ibn Mūsā, had been translated from the Arabic;\r\nthe annals of Alfonso XI. and his three immediate predecessors were\r\nwritten by some industrious mediocrity perhaps Fernán Sánchez de Tovar,\r\nor Juan Núñez de Villaizán. These are not so much absolute history\r\nas the raw material of history. In his _Chronicles of the Kings of\r\nCastile_, Ayala considers the reigns of Pedro the Cruel, Enrique II.,\r\nJuan I., and Enrique III., in a modern scientific spirit. Songs,\r\nlegends, idle reports, no longer serve as evidence. Ayala sifts his\r\ntestimonies, compares, counts, weighs them, checks them by personal\r\nknowledge. He borrows Livy's framework, inserting speeches which,\r\nif not stenographic reports of what was actually said, are complete\r\nillustrations of dramatic motive. He deals with events which he had\r\nwitnessed: plots which his crafty brain inspired, victories wherein\r\nhe shared, battles in which he bit the dust. The portraits in his\r\ngallery are scarce, but every likeness, is a masterpiece rendered with\r\na few broad strokes. He records with cold-blooded impartiality as a\r\njudge; his native austerity, his knowledge of affairs and men, guard\r\nhim from the temptations of the pleader. With his unnatural neutrality\r\ngo rare instinct for the essential circumstance, unerring sagacity in\r\nthe divination and presentment of character, unerring art in preparing\r\nclimax and catastrophe, and the gift of concise, picturesque phrase.\r\nA statesman of genius writing personal history with the candour of\r\nPepys: as such the thrifty Mérimée recognised Ayala, and, in his own\r\nconfection, so revealed him to the nineteenth century.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[4] The contents of this work are summarised in the author's _Book of\r\nStates_ (chap. xci.).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                               CHAPTER V\r\n\r\n                          THE AGE OF JUAN II.\r\n\r\n                               1419-1454\r\n\r\n\r\nAyala's verse, the conscious effort of deliberate artistry, contrasts\r\nwith those popular _romances_ which can be divined through the varnish\r\nof the sixteenth century. Few, if any, of the existing ballads date\r\nfrom Ayala's time; and of the nineteen hundred printed in Durán's\r\n_Romancero General_ the merest handful is older than 1492, when\r\nAntonio de Nebrija examined their structure in his _Arte de la Lengua\r\nCastellana_. Yet the older _romances_ were numerous and long-lived\r\nenough to supplant the _cantares de gesta_, against which chronicles\r\nand annals made war by giving the same epical themes with more detail\r\nand accuracy. In turn these chronicles afforded subjects for _romances_\r\nof a later day. An illustration suffices to prove the point. Every one\r\nknows the spirited close of the first in order of Lockhart's _Ancient\r\nSpanish Ballads_:—\r\n\r\n  \"_Last night I was the King of Spain—to-day no King am I.\r\n  Last night fair castles held my train—to-night where shall I lie?\r\n  Last night a hundred pages did serve me on the knee—\r\n  To-night not one I call my own: not one pertains to me._\"\r\n\r\nThe original is founded on Pedro de Corral's _Crónica de Don Rodrigo_\r\n(chapters 207, 208), which was not written till 1404, and from the\r\nsame source (chapters 238-244) comes the substance of Lockhart's second\r\nballad:—\r\n\r\n  \"_It was when the King Rodrigo had lost his realm of Spain._\"\r\n\r\nThe modernity of almost every piece in Lockhart's collection were as\r\neasily proved; but it is more important at this point to turn from the\r\npopular song-makers to the new school of writers which was forming\r\nitself upon foreign models.\r\n\r\nRepresentative of these innovations is the grandson of Enrique II.,\r\nENRIQUE DE VILLENA (1384-1434), upon whom posterity has conferred a\r\nmarquisate which he never possessed in life.[5] His first production is\r\nsaid to have been a set of _coplas_ written, as Master of the Order of\r\nCalatrava, for the royal feasts at Zaragoza in 1414; his earliest known\r\nwork is his _Arte de trovar_ (Art of Poetry), given in the same year\r\nat the Consistory of the Gay Science at Barcelona. Villena, of whose\r\ntreatise mere scraps survive, shows minute acquaintance with the works\r\nof early _trovadores_; of general principles he says naught, losing\r\nhimself in discursive details. Early in 1417 followed the _Trabajos de\r\nHércules_ (Labours of Hercules), first written in Catalan by request\r\nof Pero Pardo, and done into Castilian in the autumn of the year. This\r\ntedious allegory, crushed beneath a weight of pedantry, is unredeemed\r\nby ingenuity or fancy, and the style is disfigured by violent and\r\nabsurd inversions which bespeak long, tactless study of Latin texts.\r\nJuan Manuel's dignified restraint is lost on his successor, itching\r\nto flaunt inopportune learning with references to Aristotle, Aulus\r\nGellius, and St. Jerome. In 1423, at the instance of Sancho de Jaraba,\r\nVillena wrote his twenty chapters on carving—the _Arte cisoria_, an\r\nepicure's handbook to the royal table, compact of curious counsels\r\nand recipes expounded with horrid eloquence by a pedant who tended to\r\ngluttony. Still odder is the _Libro de Aojamiento_ (Dissertation on\r\nthe Evil Eye) with its three \"preventive modes,\" as recommended by\r\nAvicenna and his brethren. Translations of Dante and Cicero are lost,\r\nand three treatises on leprosy, on consolation, and on the Eighth Psalm\r\nare valueless. Villena piqued himself on being the first in Spain—he\r\nmight perhaps have said the first anywhere—to translate the whole\r\n_Æneid_; but he marches to ruin with his mimicry of Latin idioms, his\r\nabuse of inversion, and his graces of a cart-horse in the lists. No\r\ncontemporary was more famed for universal accomplishment; so that,\r\nwhile he lived, men held him for a wizard, and, when he died, applauded\r\nthe partial burning of his books by Lope de Barrientos, afterwards\r\nBishop of Segovia, who put the rest to his private uses. Santillana\r\nand Juan de Mena assert that Villena wrote Castilian verse, and Baena\r\nimplies as much; if so, he was probably a common poetaster, the loss of\r\nwhose rhymes is a stroke of luck. A Castilian poem on the labours of\r\nHercules, ascribed to him by Pellicer, is a rank forgery. Measured by\r\nhis repute, Villena's works are disappointing. But if we reflect that\r\nhe translated Dante, that he strove to naturalise successful foreign\r\nmethods, and that in his absurdest moments he proves his susceptibility\r\nto new ideas, we may explain his renown and his influence. Nor did\r\nthese end with his life; for Lope de Vega, Alarcón, Rojas Zorrilla,\r\nand Hartzenbusch have brought him on the boards, and he has appealed\r\nwith singular force to the imaginations of both Quevedo and Larra.\r\n\r\nTo Villena's time belong two specimens of the old encyclopædic school:\r\nthe _Libro de los Gatos_, translated from the _Narrationes_ of the\r\nEnglish monk, Odo of Cheriton; and the _Libro de los Enxemplos_ of\r\nClemente Sánchez of Valderas, whose seventy-one missing stories were\r\nbrought to light in 1878 by M. Morel-Fatio. Sánchez' collection,\r\nthus completed, shows the entrance into Spain of the legend of\r\nBuddha's life, adapted by some Christian monk from the Sanskrit\r\n_Lalita-Vistara_, and popular the world over as the _Romance of Barlaam\r\nand Josaphat_. The style is carefully modelled on Juan Manuel's manner.\r\n\r\nThe _Cancionero de Baena_, named after the anthologist Juan Alfonso\r\nde Baena above mentioned, contains the verses of some sixty poets\r\nwho flourished during the reign of Juan II., or a little earlier.\r\nThis collection, first published in 1851, mirrors two conflicting\r\ntendencies. The old Galician school is represented by Alfonso Álvarez\r\nde Villasandino (sometimes called de Illescas), a copious, foul-mouthed\r\nruffian, with gusts of inspiration and an abiding mastery of technique.\r\nTo the same section belong the Archdeacon of Toro, a facile versifier,\r\nand Juan Rodríguez de la Cámara, whose name is inseparable from that\r\nof Macías, _El Enamorado_. Macías has left five songs of slight\r\ndistinction, and, as a poet, ranks below Rodríguez de la Cámara. Yet he\r\nlives on the capital of his legend, the type of the lover faithful unto\r\ndeath, and the circumstances of his passing are a part of Castilian\r\nliterature. The tale is (but there are variants), that Macías, once a\r\nmember of Villena's household, was imprisoned at Arjonilla, where a\r\njealous husband slew the poet in the act of singing his platonic love.\r\nQuoted times innumerable, this more or less authentic story of Macías'\r\nend ensured him an immortality far beyond the worth of his verses: it\r\nfired the popular imagination, and enters into literature in Lope de\r\nVega's _Porfiar hasta morir_ and in Larra's _El Doncel de Don Enrique\r\nel Doliente_.\r\n\r\nA like romantic memory attaches to Macías' friend, Juan Rodríguez\r\nde la Cámara (also called Rodríguez del Padrón), the last poet of\r\nthe Galician school, represented in Baena's _Cancionero_ by a single\r\n_cántica_. The conjectures that make Rodríguez the lover of Juan\r\nII.'s wife, Isabel, or of Enrique IV.'s wife, Juana, are destroyed by\r\nchronology. None the less it is certain that the writer was concerned\r\nin some mysterious, dangerous love-affair which led to his exile, and,\r\nas some believe, to his profession as a Franciscan monk. His seventeen\r\nsurviving songs are all erotic, with the exception of the _Flama del\r\ndivino Rayo_, his best performance in thanksgiving for his spiritual\r\nconversion. His loves are also recounted in three prose books, of\r\nwhich the semi-chivalresque novel, _El Siervo libre de Amor_, is still\r\nreadable. But Rodríguez interests most as the last representative of\r\nthe Galician verse tradition.\r\n\r\nSave Ayala, who is exampled by one solitary poem, the oldest singer in\r\nBaena's choir is Pero Ferrús, the connecting link between the Galician\r\nand Italian schools. A learned rather than an inspired poet, Ferrús\r\nis remembered chiefly because of his chance allusion to _Amadís_ in\r\nthe stanzas dedicated to Ayala. Four poets in Baena's song-book herald\r\nthe invasion of Spain by the Italians, and it is fitting that the\r\nfirst and best of these should be a man of Italian blood, Francisco\r\nImperial, the son of a Genoese jeweller, settled in Seville. Imperial,\r\nas his earliest poem shows, read Arabic and English. He may have met\r\nwith Gower's _Confessio Amantis_ before it was done into Castilian by\r\nJuan de la Cuenca at the beginning of the fifteenth century—being\r\nthe first translation of an English book in Spain. Howbeit, he quotes\r\nEnglish phrases, and offers a copy of French verses. These are trifles:\r\nImperial's best gift to his adopted country was his transplanting of\r\nDante, whom he imitates assiduously, reproducing the Florentine note\r\nwith such happy intonation as to gain for him the style of poet—as\r\ndistinguished from _trovador_—from Santillana, who awards him \"the\r\nlaurel of this western land.\" Thirteen poems by Ruy Paez de Ribera,\r\nvibrating with the melancholy of illness, shuddering with the squalor\r\nof want, affiliate their writer with Imperial's new expression, and\r\nvaguely suggest the realising touch of Villon. At least one piece by\r\nFerrant Sánchez Talavera is memorable—the elegy on the death of the\r\nAdmiral Ruy Díaz de Mendoza, which anticipates the mournful march,\r\nthe solemn music, some of the very phrases of Jorge Manrique's noble\r\n_coplas_. In the Dantesque manner is Gonzalo Martínez de Medina's\r\nflagellation of the corruptions of his age. Baena, secretary to\r\nJuan II., in eighty numbers approves himself a weak imitator of\r\nVillasandino's insolence, and is remembered simply as the arranger of\r\na handbook which testifies to the definitive triumph of the compiler's\r\nenemies.\r\n\r\nA poet of greater performance than any in the _Cancionero de Baena_ is\r\nthe shifty politician, Íñigo López de Mendoza, Marqués de SANTILLANA\r\n(1398-1458), townsman of Rabbi Sem Tob, the Jew of Carrión. Oddly\r\nenough, Baena excludes Santillana from his collection, and Santillana,\r\nin reviewing the poets of his time, ignores Baena, whom he probably\r\ndespised as a parasite. A remarkable letter to the Constable of\r\nPortugal shows Santillana as a pleasant prose-writer; in his rhetorical\r\n_Lamentaçion en Propheçia de la segunda Destruyçion de España_ he\r\nfails in the grand style, though he succeeds in the familiar with his\r\ncollection of old wives' fireside proverbs, _Refranes que diçen las\r\nViejas tras el Huego_. His _Centiloquio_, a hundred rhymed proverbs\r\ndivided into fourteen chapters, is gracefully written and skilfully\r\nput together; his _Comedieta de Ponza_ is reminiscent of both Dante\r\nand Boccaccio, and its title, together with the fact that the dialogue\r\nis allotted to different personages, has led many into the error of\r\ntaking it for a dramatic piece. Far more essentially dramatic in spirit\r\nis the _Diálogo de Bias contra Fortuna_, which embodies a doctrinal\r\nargument upon the advantages of the philosophic mind in circumstances\r\nof adversity; and grouped with this goes the _Doctrinal de Privados_,\r\na fierce philippic against Álvaro de Luna, Santillana's political foe,\r\nwho is convicted of iniquities out of his own mouth.\r\n\r\nIt is impossible to say of Santillana that he was an original genius:\r\nit is within bounds to class him as a highly gifted versifier with\r\nextraordinary imitative powers. He has no \"message\" to deliver, no wide\r\nrange of ideas: his attraction lies not so much in what is said as in\r\nhis trick of saying it. He is one of the few poets whom erudition has\r\nnot hampered. He was familiar with writers as diverse as Dante and\r\nPetrarch and Alain Chartier, and he reproduces their characteristics\r\nwith a fine exactness and felicity. But he was something more than\r\nan intelligent echo, for he filed and laboured till he acquired a\r\nfinal manner of his own. Doubtless to his own taste his forty-two\r\nsonnets—_fechos al itálico modo_, as he proudly tells you were his\r\nbest titles to glory; and it is true that he acclimatised the sonnet\r\nin Spain, sharing with the Aragonese, Juan de Villapando, the honour\r\nof being Spain's only sonneteer before Boscán's time. Commonplace\r\nin thought, stiff in expression, the sonnets are only historically\r\ncurious. It is in his lighter vein that Santillana reaches his full\r\nstature. The grace and gaiety of his _decires_, _serranillas_ and\r\n_vaqueiras_ are all his own. If he borrowed suggestions from Provençal\r\npoets, he is free of the Provençal artifice, and sings with the\r\nsimplicity of Venus' doves. Here he revealed a peculiar aspect of\r\nhis many-sided temperament, and by his tact made a living thing of\r\nprimitive emotions, which were to be done to death in the pastorals of\r\nheavy-handed bunglers. The first-fruits of the pastoral harvest live in\r\nthe house where Santillana garnered them, and those roses, amid which\r\nhe found the milkmaid of La Finojosa, are still as sweet in his best\r\nknown—and perhaps his best—ballad as on that spring morning, between\r\nCalateveño and Santa María, some four hundred years since. Ceasing to\r\nbe an imitator, Santillana proves inimitable.\r\n\r\nThe official court-poet of the age was JUAN DE MENA (1411-56), known to\r\nhis own generation as the \"prince of Castilian poets,\" and Cervantes,\r\nwriting more than a hundred and fifty years afterwards, dubs him\r\n\"that great Córdoban poet.\" A true son of Córdoba, Mena has all the\r\nqualities of the Córdoban school—the ostentatious embellishment\r\nof his ancestor, Lucan, and the unintelligible preciosity of his\r\ndescendant, Góngora. The Italian travels of his youth undid him,\r\nand set him on the hopeless line of Italianising Spanish prose. A\r\nfalse attribution enters the Annals of Juan II. under Mena's name:\r\nthe mere fact that Juan II.'s _Crónica_ is a model of correct prose\r\ndisposes of the pretension. Mena's summary of the _Iliad_, and the\r\ncommentary to his poem the _Coronación_, convict him of being the\r\nworst prose-writer in all Castilian literature. Simplicity and\r\nvulgarity were for him synonyms, and he carries his doctrine to its\r\nlogical extreme by adopting impossible constructions, by wrenching\r\nhis sentences asunder by exaggerated inversions, and by adding absurd\r\nLatinisms to his vocabulary. These defects are less grave in his verse,\r\nbut even there they follow him. Argote de Molina would have him the\r\nauthor of the political satire called the _Coplas de la Panadera_;\r\nbut Mena lacked the lightness of touch, the wit and sparkle of the\r\nimaginary baker's wife. If he be read at all, he is to be studied in\r\nhis _Laberinto_, also known as the _Trescientas_, a heavy allegory\r\nwhose deliberate obscurity is indicated by its name. The alternative\r\ntitle, _Trescientas_; is explained by the fact that the poem consisted\r\nof three hundred stanzas, to which sixty-five were added by request of\r\nthe King, who kept the book by him of nights and hankered for a stanza\r\ndaily, using it, maybe, as a soporific. The poet is whisked by the\r\ndragons in Bellona's chariot to Fortune's palace, and there begins the\r\ninevitable imitation of Dante, with its machinery of seven planetary\r\ncircles, and its grandiose vision of past, present, and future. The\r\nwork of a learned poet taking himself too seriously and straining after\r\neffects beyond his reach, the _Laberinto_ is tedious as a whole; yet,\r\nthough Mena's imagination fails to realise his abstractions, though\r\nhe be riddled with purposeless conceits, he touches a high level in\r\nisolated episodes. Much of his vogue may be accounted for by the\r\nabundance with which he throws off striking lines of somewhat hard,\r\neven marmoreal beauty, and by the ardent patriotism which inspires\r\nhim in his best passages. A poet by flashes, at intervals rare and far\r\napart, Mena does himself injustice by too close a devotion to æsthetic\r\nprinciples, that made failure a certainty. Careful, conscientious,\r\naspiring, he had done far more if he had attempted much less.\r\n\r\n                   *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nMeanwhile Castilian prose goes forward on Alfonso's lines. The\r\nanonymous _Crónica_ of Juan II., wrongly ascribed to Mena and Pérez de\r\nGuzmán, but more probably due to Álvar García de Santa María and others\r\nunknown, is a classic example of style and accuracy, rare in official\r\nhistoriography. Mingled with many chivalresque details concerning the\r\nhidalgos of the court is the central episode of the book, the execution\r\nof the Constable, Álvaro de Luna. The last great scene is skilfully\r\nprepared and is recounted with artful simplicity in a celebrated\r\npassage:—\"He set to undoing his doublet-collar, making ready his long\r\ngarments of blue camlet, lined with fox-skins; and, the master being\r\nstretched upon the scaffold, the executioner came to him, begged his\r\npardon, embraced him, ran the poniard through his neck, cut off his\r\nhead, and hung it on a hook; and the head stayed there nine days, the\r\nbody three.\" Passionate declamation of a still higher order is found\r\nin the _Crónica de Don Álvaro de Luna_, written by a most dexterous\r\nadvocate, who puts his mastery of phrase, his graphic presentation\r\nand dramatic vigour, to the service of partisanship. Perhaps no man\r\nwas ever quite so great and good as Álvaro de Luna appears in his\r\n_Crónica_, but the strength of conviction in the narrator is expressed\r\nin terms of moving eloquence that would persuade to accept the\r\nportrait, not merely as a masterpiece—for that it is—but, as an\r\nauthentic presentment of a misunderstood hero.\r\n\r\nAfter much violent controversy, it may now be taken as settled that\r\nthe _Crónica del Cid_ is based upon Alfonso's _Estoria de Espanna_.\r\nBut it comes not direct, being borrowed from Alfonso XI.'s _Crónica\r\nde Castilla_, a transcript of the _Estoria_. The differences from\r\nthe early text may be classed under three heads: corruptions of the\r\nearly text, freer and exacter quotations from the _romances_, and\r\ndeliberate alterations made with an eye to greater conformity with\r\npopular legends. Valuable as containing the earliest versions of many\r\ntraditions which were to be diffused through the _Romanceros_, the\r\n_Crónica del Cid_ is of small historic authority, and Alfonso's stately\r\nprose loses greatly in the carrying.\r\n\r\nAyala's nephew, FERNÁN PÉREZ DE GUZMÁN (1378-1460), continues his\r\nuncle's poetic tradition in the forms borrowed from Italy, as well as\r\nin earlier lyrics of the Galician school; but his mediocre performances\r\nas a poet are overshadowed by his brilliant exploit as a historian. He\r\nis responsible for the _Mar de Historias_ (The Sea of Histories), which\r\nconsists of three divisions. The first deals with emperors and kings\r\nranging from Alexander to King Arthur, from Charlemagne to Godfrey de\r\nBouillon; the second treats of saints and sages, their lives and the\r\nbooks they wrote; and both are arrangements of some French version of\r\nGuido delle Colonne's _Mare Historiarum_. The third part, now known\r\nas the _Generaciones y Semblanzas_ (Generations and Likenesses), is\r\nPérez de Guzmán's own workmanship. Foreign critics have compared him to\r\nPlutarch and to St. Simon; and, though the parallel seems dangerous, it\r\ncan be maintained. This amounts to saying that Pérez de Guzmán is one\r\nof the greatest portrait-painters in the world; and that precisely he\r\nis. He argues from the seen to the unseen with a curious anticipation\r\nof modern psychological methods; and it forms an integral part of his\r\nplan to draw his personages with the audacity of truth. He does his\r\nshare, and there they stand, living as our present-day acquaintances,\r\nand better known. Take a few figures at random from his gallery:\r\nEnrique de Villena, fat, short, and fair, a libidinous glutton, ever in\r\nthe clouds, a dolt in practice, subtle of genius so that he came by all\r\npure knowledge easily; Núñez de Guzmán, dissolute, of giant strength,\r\ncurt of speech, a jovial roysterer; the King Enrique, grave-visaged,\r\nbitter-tongued, lonely, melancholy; Catherine of Lancaster, tall, fair,\r\nruddy, wine-bibbing, ending in paralysis; the Constable López Dávalos,\r\na self-made man, handsome, taking, gay, amiable, strong, a fighter,\r\nclever, prudent, but—as man must have some fault—cunning and given\r\nto astrology. With such portraits Pérez de Guzmán abounds. The picture\r\ncosts him no effort: the man is seized in the act and delivered to\r\nyou, with no waste of words, with no essential lacking, classified\r\nas a museum specimen, impartially but with a tendency to severity;\r\nand when Pérez de Guzmán has spoken, there is no more to say. He is\r\na good hater, and lets you see it when he deals with courtiers, whom\r\nhe regards with the true St. Simonian loathing for an upstart. But\r\nhistory has confirmed the substantial justice of his verdicts, and has\r\nthus shown that the artist in him was even stronger than the malignant\r\npartisan. It is saying much. And to his endowment of observation,\r\nintelligence, knowledge, and character, Pérez de Guzmán joins the\r\nperfect practice of that clear, energetic Castilian speech which his\r\nforebears bequeathed him.\r\n\r\nAn interesting personal narrative hides beneath the mask of the _Vida\r\ny Hazañas del gran Tamarlán_ (Life and Deeds of the Mighty Timour).\r\nFirst published in 1582, this work is nothing less than a report of the\r\njourney (1403-6) of Ruy González de Clavijo (d. 1412), who traversed\r\nall the space \"from silken Samarcand to cedar'd Lebanon,\" and more.\r\nClavijo tells of his wanderings with a quaint mingling of credulity\r\nand scepticism; still, his witness is at least as trustworthy as Marco\r\nPolo's, and his recital is vastly more graphic than the Venetian's.\r\nA very similar motive informs the _Crónica del Conde de Buelna, Don\r\nPero Niño_ (1375-1446), by Pero Niño's friend and pennon-bearer,\r\nGutierre Díaz Gámez. An alternative title—the _Victorial_—discloses\r\nthe author's intention of representing his leader as the hero of\r\ncountless triumphs by sea and land. A well-read esquire, Díaz Gámez\r\nquotes from the _Libro de Alexandre_, flecks his pages with allusions,\r\nand—with a true traveller's lust for local colouring—comes pat with\r\ntechnical French terms: his _sanglieres_, _mestrieres_, _cursieres_,\r\n_destrieres_. These affectations apart, Díaz Gámez writes with sense\r\nand force; exalting his chief overmuch, but giving bright glimpses\r\nof a mad, adventurous life, and rising to altisonant eloquence in\r\nchivalresque outbursts, one of which Cervantes has borrowed, and not\r\nbettered, in Don Quixote's great discourse on letters and arms.\r\n\r\nKnight-errantry was, indeed, beginning to possess the land, and, as\r\nit chances, an account of the maddest, hugest tourney in the world's\r\nhistory is written for us by an eye-witness, Pero Rodríguez de Lena,\r\nin the _Libro del Paso Honroso_ (Book of the Passage of Honour). Lena\r\ntells how the demon of chivalry entered into Suero de Quiñones, who,\r\nseeking release from his pledge of wearing in his lady's honour\r\nan iron chain each Thursday, could hit on no better means than by\r\noffering, with nine knightly brethren, to hold the bridge of San Marcos\r\nat Órbigo against the paladins of Europe. The tilt lasted from July 10\r\nto August 9, 1434, and is described with simple directness by Lena, who\r\nlooks upon the six hundred single combats as the most natural thing in\r\nthe world: but his story is important as a \"human document,\" and as\r\ntestimony that the extravagant incidents of the chivalrous romances had\r\ntheir counterparts in real life.\r\n\r\nThe fifteenth century finds the chivalrous romance established in\r\nSpain: how it arrived there must be left for discussion till we come\r\nto deal with the best example of the kind—_Amadís de Gaula_. Here and\r\nnow it suffices to say that there probably existed an early Spanish\r\nversion of this story which has disappeared; and to note that the\r\ndividing line between the annals, filled with impossible traditions,\r\nand the chivalrous tales, is of the finest: so fine, in fact, that\r\nseveral of the latter—for example, _Florisel de Niquea_ and _Amadís\r\nde Grecia_—take on historical airs and call themselves _crónicas_.\r\nThe mention of the lost Castilian _Amadís_ is imperative at this point\r\nif we are to recognise one of the chief contemporary influences. For\r\nthe moment, we must be content to note its practical manifestations\r\nin the extravagances of Suero de Quiñones, and of other knights whose\r\nnames are given in the chronicles of Álvaro de Luna and Juan II. The\r\nspasmodic outbursts of the craze observable in the serious chapters of\r\nDíaz Gámez are but the distant rumblings before the hurricane.\r\n\r\nWhile _Amadís de Gaula_ was read in courts and palaces, three\r\ncontemporary writers worked in different veins. ALFONSO MARTÍNEZ DE\r\nTOLEDO (1398-?1466), Archpriest of Talavera, and chaplain to Juan\r\nII., is the author of the _Reprobación del Amor mundano_, otherwise\r\n_El Corbacho_ (The Scourge). The latter title, not of the author's\r\nchoosing, has led some to say that he borrowed from Boccaccio. The\r\nresemblance between the _Reprobación_ and the Italian _Corbaccio_\r\nis purely superficial. Martínez goes forth to rebuke the vices of\r\nboth sexes in his age; but the moral purpose is dropped, and he\r\nsettles down to a deliberate invective against women and their ways.\r\nAmador de los Ríos suggests that Martínez stole hints from Francisco\r\nEximenis' _Carro de la donas_, a Catalan version of Boccaccio's _De\r\nclaris mulieribus_: as the latter is a panegyric on the sex, the\r\nsuggestion is unacceptable. The plain fact stares us in the face that\r\nMartínez' immediate model is the Archpriest of Hita, and in his fourth\r\nchapter that jovial clerk is cited. Indiscriminate, unjust, and even\r\nbrutal, as Martínez often is, his slashing satire may be read with\r\nextraordinary pleasure: that is, when we can read him at all, for his\r\neditions are rare and his vocabulary puzzling. He falls short of Ruiz'\r\nwicked urbanity; but he matches him in keenness of malicious wit, in\r\nmalignant parody, in picaresque intention, while he surpasses him as\r\na collector of verbal quips and popular proverbs. The wealth of his\r\nsplenetic genius (it is nothing less) affords at least one passage to\r\nthe writer of the _Celestina_. Last of all—and this is an exceeding\r\nvirtue—Martínez' speech maintains a fine standard of purity at a time\r\nwhen foreign corruptions ran riot. Hence he deserves high rank among\r\nthe models of Castilian prose.\r\n\r\nAnother chaplain of Juan II., JUAN DE LUCENA (fl. 1453), is the\r\nauthor of the _Vita Beata_, lacking in originality, but notable for\r\nexcellence of absolute style. He follows Cicero's plan in the _De\r\nfinibus bonorum et malorum_, introducing Santillana, Mena, and García\r\nde Santa María (the probable author, as we have seen, of the King's\r\n_Crónica_). In an imaginary conversation these great personages discuss\r\nthe question of mortal happiness, arriving at the pessimist conclusion\r\nthat it does not exist, or—sorry alternative—that it is unattainable.\r\nLucena adds nothing to the fund of ideas upon this hackneyed theme,\r\nbut the perfect finish of his manner lends attraction to his lucid\r\ncommonplaces.\r\n\r\nThe last considerable writer of the time is the Bachelor ALFONSO DE\r\nLA TORRE (fl. 1461), who returns upon the didactic manner in his\r\n_Visión deleitable de la Filosofía y Artes liberales_. Nominally,\r\nthe Bachelor offers a philosophic, allegorical novel; in substance,\r\nhis work is a mediæval encyclopædia. It was assuredly never designed\r\nfor entertainment, but it must still be read by all who are curious\r\nto catch those elaborate harmonies and more delicate refinements of\r\nfifteenth-century Castilian prose which half tempt to indulgence for\r\nthe writer's insufferable priggishness. Alfonso de la Torre figures by\r\nright in the anthologies, and his elegant extracts win an admiration of\r\nwhich his unhappy choice of subject would otherwise deprive him.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[5] Strictly speaking, this writer should be called Enrique de Aragón;\r\nbut, since this leads to confusion with his contemporary, the Infante\r\nEnrique de Aragón, it is convenient to distinguish him as Enrique de\r\nVillena. He was not a marquis, and never uses the title.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER VI\r\n\r\n             THE AGE OF ENRIQUE IV. AND THE CATHOLIC KINGS\r\n\r\n                               1454-1516\r\n\r\n\r\nThe literary movement of Juan II.'s reign is overlapped and continued\r\noutside Spain by poets in the train of Alfonso V. of Aragón, who,\r\nconquering Naples in 1443, became the patron of scholars like George\r\nof Trebizond and Æneas Sylvius. It is notable that, despite their new\r\nItalian environment, Alfonso's singers write by preference in Castilian\r\nrather than in their native Catalan. Their work is to be sought in\r\nthe _Cancionero General_, in the _Cancionero de burlas provocantes á\r\nrisa_, and especially in the _Cancionero de Stúñiga_, which derives\r\nits name from the accident that the first two poems in the collection\r\nare by Lope de Stúñiga, cousin of that Suero de Quiñones who held the\r\n_Paso Honroso_, mentioned under Lena's name in the previous chapter.\r\nStúñiga prolongs the courtly tradition in verses whose extreme finish\r\nis remarkable. Juan de Tapia, Juan de Andújar, and Fernando de la\r\nTorre practise in the same school of knightly hedonism; and at the\r\nopposite pole is Juan de Valladolid, son of the public executioner, a\r\nvagabond minstrel, who passed his life in coarse polemics with Antón de\r\nMontero, with Gómez Manrique, and with Manrique's brother, the Conde\r\nde Paredes. A notorious name is that of Pero Torrellas, whose _Coplas\r\nde las calidades de las donas_ won their author repute as a satirist\r\nof women, and begot innumerable replies and counterpleas: the satire,\r\nto tell the truth, is poor enough, and is little more than violent but\r\npointless invective. The best as well as the most copious poet of the\r\nNeapolitan group is CARVAJAL (or CARVAJALES), who bequeaths us the\r\nearliest known _romance_, and so far succumbs to circumstances as to\r\nproduce occasional verses in Italian. In Castilian, Carvajal has the\r\ntrue lyrical cry, and is further distinguished by a virile, martial\r\nnote, in admirable contrast with the insipid courtesies of his brethren.\r\n\r\nTo return to Spain, where, in accordance with the maxim that one\r\nconsiderable poet begets many poetasters, countless rhymesters\r\nspring from Mena's loins. The briefest mention must suffice for the\r\ntoo-celebrated _Coplas del Provincial_, which, to judge by the extracts\r\nprinted from its hundred and forty-nine stanzas, is a prurient lampoon\r\nagainst private persons. It lacks neither vigour nor wit, and denotes\r\na mastery of mordant phrase: but the general effect of its obscene\r\nmalignity is to make one sympathise with the repeated attempts at\r\nits suppression. The attribution to Rodrigo Cota of this perverse\r\nperformance is capricious: internal evidence goes to show that the\r\nlibel is the work of several hands.\r\n\r\nA companion piece of far greater merit is found in thirty-two\r\noctosyllabic stanzas entitled _Coplas de Mingo Revulgo_. Like the\r\n_Coplas del Provincial_, this satirical eclogue has been referred\r\nto Rodrigo Cota, and, like many other anonymous works, it has been\r\nascribed to Mena. Neither conjecture is supported by evidence, and\r\nSarmiento's ascription of _Mingo Revulgo_ to Hernando del Pulgar, who\r\nwrote an elaborate commentary on it, rests on the puerile assumption\r\nthat \"none but the poet could have commented himself with such\r\nclearness.\" Two shepherds—Mingo Revulgo and Gil Aribato—represent\r\nthe lower and upper class respectively, discussing the abuses of\r\nsociety. Gil Aribato blames the people, whose vices are responsible for\r\ncorruption in high places; Mingo Revulgo contends that the dissolute\r\nKing should bear the blame for the ruin of the state, and the argument\r\nends by lauding the golden mean of the burgess. The tone of _Mingo\r\nRevulgo_ is more moderate than that of the _Provincial_; the attacks\r\non current evils are more general, more discreet, and therefore more\r\ndeadly; and the aim of the later satire is infinitely more serious and\r\nelevated. Cast in dramatic form, but devoid of dramatic action, _Mingo\r\nRevulgo_ leads directly to the eclogues of Juan del Encina, so often\r\ncalled the father of the Spanish theatre; but its immediate interest\r\nlies in the fact that it is the first of effective popular satires.\r\n\r\nAmong the poets of this age, the Jewish convert, ANTÓN DE MONTORO, _el\r\nRopero_ (1404-?1480), holds a place apart. A fellow of parts, Montoro\r\ncombined verse-making with tailoring, and his trade is frequently\r\nthrown in his teeth by rivals smarting under his bitter insolence.\r\nSave when he pleads manfully for his kinsfolk, who are persecuted and\r\nslaughtered by a bloodthirsty mob, Montoro's serious efforts are mostly\r\nfailures. His picaresque verses, especially those addressed to Juan\r\nde Valladolid, are replenished with a truculent gaiety which amuses\r\nus almost as much as it amused Santillana; but he should be read in\r\nextracts rather than at length. He is suspected of complicity in the\r\n_Coplas del Provincial_, and there is good ground for thinking that\r\nto him belong the two most scandalous pieces in the _Cancionero de\r\nburlas provocantes á risa_—namely, the _Pleito del Manto_ (Suit of\r\nthe Coverlet), and a certain unmentionable comedy which purports to\r\nbe by Fray Montesino, and travesties Mena's _Trescientas_ in terms of\r\nextreme filthiness. Montoro's short pieces are reminiscent of Juan\r\nRuiz, and, for all his indecency, it is fair to credit him with much\r\ncleverness and with uncommon technical skill. His native vulgarity\r\nbetrays him into excesses of ribaldry which mar the proper exercise of\r\nhis undeniable gifts.\r\n\r\nA better man and a better writer is JUAN ÁLVAREZ GATO (?1433-96), the\r\nMadrid knight of whom Gómez Manrique says that he \"spoke pearls and\r\nsilver.\" It is difficult for us to judge him on his merits, for, though\r\nhis _cancionero_ exists, it has not yet been printed; and we are forced\r\nto study him as he is represented in the _Cancionero General_, where\r\nhis love-songs show a dignity of sentiment and an exquisiteness of\r\nexpression not frequent in any epoch, and exceptional in his own time.\r\nHis sacred lyrics, the work of his old age, lack unction: but even\r\nhere his mastery of form saves his pious _villancicos_ from oblivion,\r\nand ranks him as the best of Encina's predecessors. His friend, Hernán\r\nMexía, follows Pero Torrellas with a satire on the foibles of women, in\r\nwhich he easily outdoes his model in mischievous wit and in ingenious\r\nfancy.\r\n\r\nGÓMEZ MANRIQUE, Señor de Villazopeque (1412-91), is a poet of\r\nreal distinction, whose entire works have been reprinted from two\r\ncomplementary _cancioneros_ discovered in 1885. Sprung from a family\r\nillustrious in Spanish history, Gómez Manrique was a foremost leader\r\nin the rebellion of the Castilian nobles against Enrique IV. In\r\nallegorical pieces like the _Batalla de amores_, he frankly imitates\r\nthe Galician model, and in one instance he replies to a certain Don\r\nÁlvaro in Portuguese. Then he joins himself to the rising Italian\r\nschool, wherein his uncle, Santillana, had preceded him; and his\r\nexperiments extend to adaptations of Sem Tob's sententious moralisings,\r\nto didactic poems in the manner of Mena, and to _coplas_ on Juan de\r\nValladolid, in which he measures himself unsuccessfully with the\r\nrude tailor, Montoro. Humour was not Gómez Manrique's calling, and\r\nhis attention to form is an obvious preoccupation which diminishes\r\nhis vigour: but his chivalrous refinement and noble tenderness are\r\nmanifest in his answer to Torrellas' invective. His pathos is nowhere\r\nmore touching than in the elegiacs on Garcilaso de la Vega; while in\r\nthe lines to his wife, Juana de Mendoza, Gómez Manrique portrays the\r\nfleetingness of life, the sting of death, with almost incomparable\r\nbeauty.\r\n\r\nHis _Representación del Nacimiento de Nuestro Señor_, the earliest\r\nsuccessor to the _Misterio de los Reyes Magos_, is a liturgical\r\ndrama written for and played at the convent of Calabazanos, of which\r\nhis sister was Superior. It consists of twenty octosyllabic stanzas\r\ndelivered by the Virgin, St. Joseph, St. Gabriel, St. Michael, St.\r\nRaphael, an angel, and three shepherds, the whole closing with a\r\ncradle-song. Simple as the construction is, it is more elaborate than\r\nthat of a later play on the Passion, wherein the Virgin, St. John, and\r\nthe Magdalen appear (though the last takes no part in the dialogue).\r\nThe refrain or _estribillo_ at the end of each stanza goes to show\r\nthat this piece was intended to be sung. These primitive essays in\r\nthe hieratic drama have all the interest of what was virtually a new\r\ninvention, and their historical importance is only exceeded by that of\r\na secular play, written by Gómez Manrique for the birthday of Alfonso,\r\nbrother of Enrique IV., in which the Infanta Isabel played one of the\r\nMuses. In all three experiments the action is of the slightest, though\r\nthe dialogue is as dramatic as can be expected from a first attempt.\r\nThe point to be noted is that Gómez Manrique foreshadows both the lay\r\nand sacred elements of the Spanish theatre.\r\n\r\nHis fame has been unjustly eclipsed by that of his nephew, JORGE\r\nMANRIQUE, Señor de Belmontejo (1440-1478), a brilliant soldier and\r\npartisan of Queen Isabel's, who perished in an encounter before\r\nthe gates of Garci-Múñoz, and is renowned by reason of a single\r\nmasterpiece. His verses are mostly to be found in the _Cancionero\r\nGeneral_, and a few are given in the _cancioneros_ of Seville and\r\nToledo. Like that of his uncle, Gómez, his vein of humour is thin and\r\npoor, and the satiric stanzas to his stepmother border on vulgarity.\r\nIn acrostic love-songs and in other compositions of a like character,\r\nJorge Manrique is merely clever in the artificial style of many\r\ncontemporaries—is merely a careful craftsman absorbed in the technical\r\ndetails of art, with small merit beyond that of formal dexterity. The\r\nforty-three stanzas entitled the _Coplas de Jorge Manrique por la\r\nmuerte de su padre_, have brought their writer an immortality which,\r\noutliving all freaks of taste, seems as secure as Cervantes' own. An\r\nattempt has been made to prove that Jorge Manrique's elegiacs on his\r\nfather are not original, and that the elegist had some knowledge of Abu\r\n'l-Bakā Salih ar-Rundi's poem on the decadence of the Moslem power in\r\nSpain. Undoubtedly Valera has so ingeniously rendered the Arab poet as\r\nto make the resemblance seem pronounced: but the theory is untenable,\r\nfor it is not pretended that Jorge Manrique could read Arabic, and\r\nlofty commonplaces on death abound in all literature, from the Bible\r\ndownwards.\r\n\r\nIn this unique composition Jorge Manrique approves himself, for once,\r\na poet of absolute genius, an exquisite in lyrical orchestration. The\r\npoem opens with a slow movement, a solemn lament on the vanity of\r\ngrandeur, the frailty of life; it modulates into resigned acceptance of\r\nan inscrutable decree; it closes with a superb symphony, through which\r\nare heard the voices of the seraphim and the angelic harps of Paradise.\r\nThe workmanship is of almost incomparable excellence, and in scarcely\r\none stanza can the severest criticism find a technical flaw. Jorge\r\nManrique's sincerity touched a chord which vibrates in the universal\r\nheart, and his poem attained a popularity as immediate as it was\r\nimperishable. Camões sought to imitate it; writers like Montemôr and\r\nSilvestre glossed it; Lope de Vega declared that it should be written\r\nin letters of gold; it was done into Latin and set to music in the\r\nsixteenth century by Venegas de Henestrosa; and in our century it has\r\nbeen admirably translated by Longfellow in a version from which these\r\nstanzas are taken:—\r\n\r\n  \"_Behold of what delusive worth\r\n  The bubbles we pursue on earth,\r\n      The shapes we chase\r\n  Amid a world of treachery;\r\n  They vanish ere death shuts the eye,\r\n      And leave no trace._\r\n\r\n  _Time steals them from us,—chances strange,\r\n  Disastrous accidents, and change,\r\n      That come to all;\r\n  Even in the most exalted state,\r\n  Relentless sweeps the stroke of fate;\r\n      The strongest fall._\r\n\r\n  _Tell me,—the charms that lovers seek\r\n  In the clear eye and blushing cheek,\r\n      The hues that play\r\n  O'er rosy lip and brow of snow,\r\n  When hoary age approaches slow,\r\n      Ah, where are they?..._\r\n\r\n  _Tourney and joust, that charmed the eye,\r\n  And scarf, and gorgeous panoply,\r\n      And nodding plume,—\r\n  What were they but a pageant scene?\r\n  What but the garlands gay and green,\r\n      That deck the tomb?..._\r\n\r\n  _O Death, no more, no more delay;\r\n  My spirit longs to flee away,\r\n      And be at rest;\r\n  The will of Heaven my will shall be,—\r\n  I bow to the divine decree,\r\n      To God's behest...._\r\n\r\n  _His soul to Him who gave it rose:\r\n  God lead it to its long repose,\r\n      Its glorious rest!\r\n  And though the warrior's sun has set,\r\n  Its light shall linger round us yet,\r\n      Bright, radiant, blest._\"\r\n\r\nBy the side of this achievement the remaining poems of Enrique IV.'s\r\nreign seem wan and withered. But mention is due to the Sevillan, Pedro\r\nGuillén de Segovia (1413-74), who, beginning life under the patronage\r\nof Álvaro de Luna, Santillana, and Mena, passes into the household of\r\nthe alchemist-archbishop Carrillo, and proclaims himself a disciple\r\nof Gómez Manrique. His chief performance is his metrical version of\r\nthe Seven Penitential Psalms, which is remarkable as being the first\r\nattempt at introducing the biblical element into Spanish literature.\r\n\r\nProse is represented by the Segovian, Diego Enríquez del Castillo (fl.\r\n1470), chaplain and privy councillor to Enrique IV., whose official\r\n_Crónica_ he drew up in a spirit of candid impartiality; but there is\r\nground for suspecting that he revised his manuscript after the King's\r\ndeath. Charged with speeches and addresses, his history is written with\r\npompous correctness, and it seems probable that the wily trimmer so\r\nchose his sonorous ambiguities of phrase as to avoid offending either\r\nhis sovereign or the rebel magnates whose triumph he foresaw. Another\r\nchronicle of this reign is ascribed to Alfonso Fernández de Palencia\r\n(1423-92), who is also rashly credited with the authorship of the\r\n_Coplas del Provincial_; but it is not proved that Palencia wrote any\r\nother historical work than his Latin _Gesta Hispaniensia_, a mordant\r\npresentation of the time's corruptions. The Castilian chronicle which\r\npasses under his name is a rough translation of the _Gesta_, made\r\nwithout the writer's authority. Its involved periods, some of them a\r\nchapter long, are very remote from the admirably vigorous style of\r\nPalencia's allegorical _Batalla campal entre los lobos y los perros_\r\n(Pitched Battle between Wolves and Dogs), and his patriotic _Perfección\r\ndel triunfo militar_, wherein he vaunts, not without reason, his\r\ncountrymen as among the best fighting men in Europe. Palencia's gravest\r\ndefect is his tendency to Latinise his construction, as in his poor\r\nrenderings of Plutarch and Josephus. But at his best he writes with\r\nease and force and distinction. The _Crónica de hechos del Condestable\r\nMiguel Lucas Iranzo_, possibly the work of Juan de Olid, is in no sense\r\nthe history it professes to be, and is valuable mainly because of its\r\npicturesque, yet simple and natural digressions on the social life of\r\nSpain.\r\n\r\n                   *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe very year of the Catholic King's accession (1474) coincides with\r\nthe introduction of the art of printing into Spain. Ticknor dates\r\nthis event as happening in 1468, remarking that \"there can be no\r\ndoubt about the matter.\" Unluckily, the book upon which he relies\r\nis erroneously dated. _Les Trobes en lahors de la Verge María_—the\r\nfirst volume printed in Spain—is a collection of devout verses in\r\nValencian, by forty-four poets, mostly Catalans. Of these, Francisco\r\nde Castellví, Francisco Barcelo, Pedro de Civillar, and an anonymous\r\nsinger—_Hum Castellá sens nom_—write in Castilian. From 1474 onward,\r\nprinting-presses multiply, and versions of masters like Dante,\r\nBoccaccio, and Petrarch, made by Pedro Fernández de Villegas, by Álvar\r\nGómez, and by Antonio de Obregón, are printed in quick succession.\r\nHenceforward the best models are available beyond a small wealthy\r\ncircle; but the results of this popularisation are not immediate.\r\n\r\nÍñigo de Mendoza, a gallant and a Franciscan, appears as a disciple\r\nof Mena and Gómez Manrique in his _Vita Christi_, which halts at the\r\nMassacre of the Innocents. Fray Íñigo is too prone to digressions,\r\nand to misplaced satire mimicked from _Mingo Revulgo_, yet his verses\r\nhave a pleasing, unconventional charm in their adaptation to devout\r\npurpose of such lyric forms as the _romance_ and the _villancico_. His\r\nfellow-monk, Ambrosio Montesino, Isabel's favourite poet, conveys to\r\nSpain the Italian realism of Jacopone da Todi in his _Visitación de\r\nNuestra Señora_, and in hymns fitted to the popular airs preserved in\r\nAsenjo Barbieri's _Cancionero Musical de los siglos xv. y xvi_. This\r\nembarrassing condition, joined to the writer's passion for conciseness,\r\nresults in hard effects; yet, at his best, he pipes \"a simple song\r\nfor thinking hearts,\" and, as Menéndez y Pelayo, the chief of Spanish\r\ncritics, observes, Montesino's historic interest lies in his suffusing\r\npopular verse with the spirit of mysticism, and in his transmuting the\r\npopular forms of song into artistic forms.\r\n\r\nSpace fails for contemporary authors of _esparsas_, _decires_,\r\n_resquestas_, more or less ingenious; but we cannot omit the name of\r\nthe Carthusian, JUAN DE PADILLA (1468-?1522), who suffers from an\r\nadmirer's indiscretion in calling him \"the Spanish Homer.\" His _Retablo\r\nde la Vida de Cristo_ versifies the Saviour's life in the manner of\r\nJuvencus, and his more elaborate poem, _Los doce triunfos de los doce\r\nApóstoles_, strives to fuse Dante's severity with Petrarch's grace.\r\nRhetorical out of season, and tending to abuse his sonorous vocabulary,\r\nPadilla indulges in verbal eccentricities and in sudden drops from\r\naltisonance to familiarity; but in his best passages—his journey\r\nthrough hell and purgatory, guided by St. Paul—he excels by force\r\nof vision, by his realisation of the horror of the grave, and by his\r\nvigorous transcription of the agonies of the lost. The allegorical form\r\nis again found in the _Infierno del Amor_ of Garci Sánchez de Badajoz,\r\nwho ended life in a madhouse. His presentation of Macías, Rodríguez\r\ndel Padrón, Santillana, and Jorge Manrique in thrall to love's\r\nenchantments, was to the taste of his time, and a poem with the same\r\ntitle, _Infierno del Amor_, made the reputation of a certain Guevara,\r\nwhose scattered songs are full of picaresque and biting wit. For the\r\nrest, Sánchez de Badajoz depends upon his daring, almost blasphemous\r\nhumour, his facility in improvising, and his mastery of popular forms.\r\n\r\nOf the younger poetic generation, PEDRO MANUEL DE URREA (1486-? 1530)\r\nis the most striking artist. His _Peregrinación á Jersualén_ and his\r\n_Penitencia de Amor_ are practically inaccessible, but his _Cancionero_\r\ndisplays an ingenious and versatile talent. Urrea's aristocratic\r\nspirit revolts at the thought that in this age of printing his songs\r\nwill be read \"in cellars and kitchens,\" and the publication of his\r\nverses seems due to his mother. His _Fiestas de Amor_, translated from\r\nPetrarch, are tedious, but he has a perfect mastery of the popular\r\n_décima_, and his _villancicos_ abound in quips of fancy matched by\r\nsubtleties of expression. Urrea fails when he closes a stanza with a\r\nLatin tag—a dubious adonic, such as _Dominus tecum_. He fares better\r\nwith his modification of Jorge Manrique's stanza, approving his skill\r\nin modulatory effects. His most curious essay is his verse rendering of\r\nthe _Celestina's_ first act; for here he anticipates the very modes of\r\nLope de Vega and of Tirso de Molina. But in his own day he was not the\r\nsole practitioner in dramatic verse.\r\n\r\nA distinct progress in this direction is made by RODRIGO COTA DE\r\nMAGUAQUE (fl. 1490), a convert Jew, who incited the mob to massacre his\r\nbrethren. Wrongly reputed the author of the _Coplas del Provincial_,\r\nof _Mingo Revulgo_, and of the _Celestina_, Cota is the parent of\r\nfifty-eight quatrains, in the form of a burlesque wedding-song,\r\nrecently discovered by M. Foulché-Delbosc. But Cota's place in\r\nliterature is ensured by his celebrated _Diálogo entre el Amor y un\r\nViejo_. In seventy stanzas Love and the Ancient argue the merits of\r\nlove, till the latter yields to the persuasion of the god, who then\r\nderides the hoary amorist. The dialogue is eminently dramatic both in\r\nform and spirit, the action convincing, clear, and rapid, while the\r\nversification is marked by an exquisite melody. It is not known that\r\nthe _Diálogo_ was ever played, yet it is singularly fitted for scenic\r\npresentation.\r\n\r\nThe earliest known writer for the stage among the moderns was,\r\nas we have already said, Gómez Manrique; but earlier spectacles\r\nare frequently mentioned in fifteenth-century chronicles. These\r\nmay be divided into _entremeses_, a term loosely applied to balls\r\nand tourneys, accompanied by chorus-singing; and into _momos_,\r\nentertainments which took on a more literary character, and which found\r\nexcuses for dramatic celebrations at Christmas and Eastertide. Gómez\r\nManrique had made a step forward, but his pieces are primitive and\r\nfragmentary compared to those of JUAN DEL ENCINA (1468-1534). A story\r\ngiven in the scandalous _Pleito del Manto_ reports that Encina was the\r\nson of Pero Torrellas, and another idle tale declares him to be Juan de\r\nTamayo. The latter is proved a blunder; the former is discredited by\r\nEncina's solemn cursing of Torrellas. Encina passed from the University\r\nof Salamanca to the household of the Duke of Alba (1493), was present\r\nnext year at the siege of Granada, and celebrated the victory in his\r\n_Triunfo de fama_. Leaving for Italy in 1498, he is found at Rome in\r\n1502, a favourite with that Spanish Pope, Alexander VI. He returned\r\nto Spain, took orders, and sang his first mass at Jerusalem in 1519,\r\nat which date he was appointed Prior of the Monastery of León. He is\r\nthought to have died at Salamanca.\r\n\r\nEncina began writing in his teens, and has left us over a hundred and\r\nseventy lyrics, composed before he was twenty-five years old. Nearly\r\neighty pieces, with musical settings by the author, are given in\r\nAsenjo Barbieri's _Cancionero Musical_. His songs, when undisfigured\r\nby deliberate conceits, are full of devotional charm. Still, Encina\r\nabides with us in virtue of his eclogues, the first two being given\r\nin the presence of his patrons at Alba de Tormes, probably in 1492.\r\nHis plays are fourteen in number, and were undoubtedly staged. Ticknor\r\nwould persuade us that the seventh and eighth, though really one piece,\r\n\"with a pause between,\" were separated by the poet \"in his simplicity.\"\r\nEven Encina's simplicity may be overstated, and Ticknor's \"pause\" must\r\nhave been long: for the seventh eclogue was played in 1494, and the\r\neighth in 1495. His eclogues are eclogues only in name, being dramatic\r\npresentations of primitive themes, with a distinct but simple action.\r\nThe occasion is generally a feast-day, and the subject is sometimes\r\nsacred. Yet not always so: the _Égloga de Fileno_ dramatises the\r\nshepherd's passion for Lefira, and ends with a suicide suggested by the\r\n_Celestina_. In like wise, Encina's _Plácida y Vitoriano_, involving\r\ntwo attempted suicides and one scabrous scene, introduces Venus and\r\nMercury as characters. Again, the _Aucto del Repelón_ dramatises the\r\nadventures in the market-place of two shepherds, Johan Paramas and\r\nPiernicurto; while _Cristino y Febea_ exhibits the ignominious downfall\r\nof a would-be hermit in phrases redolent of Cota's _Diálogo_. Simple\r\nas the motives are, they are skilfully treated, and the versification,\r\nespecially in _Plácida y Vitoriano_, is pure and elegant. Encina\r\nelaborates the strictly liturgical drama to its utmost point, and his\r\nyounger contemporary, Lucas Fernández, makes no further progress, for\r\nthe obvious reason that no novelty was possible without incurring a\r\ncharge of heresy. As Sr. Cotarelo y Mori has pointed out, the sacred\r\ndrama remains undeveloped till the lives of saints and the theological\r\nmysteries are exploited by men of genius. Meanwhile, Encina has begun\r\nthe movement which culminates in the _autos_ of Calderón.\r\n\r\nIn another direction, the Spanish version of _Amadís de Gaula_ (1508)\r\nmarks an epoch. This story was known to Ayala and three other singers\r\nin Baena's chorus; and the probability is that the lost original was\r\nwritten in Portuguese by Joham de Lobeira (1261-1325), who uses in\r\nthe Colocci-Brancuti _Canzoniere_ (No. 230) the same _ritournelle_\r\nthat Oriana sings in _Amadís_. GARCÍA ORDÓÑEZ DE MONTALVO (fl. 1500)\r\nadmits that three-fourths of his book is mere translation; and it may\r\nbe that he was not the earliest Spaniard to annex the story, which, in\r\nthe first instance, derives from France. Amadís of Gaul is a British\r\nknight, and, though the geography is bewildering, \"Gaul\" stands for\r\nWales, as \"Bristoya\" and \"Vindilisora\" stand for Bristol and Windsor.\r\nThe chronology is no less puzzling, for the action occurs \"not many\r\nyears after the Passion of our Redeemer.\" Briefly, the book deals\r\nwith the chequered love of Amadís for Oriana, daughter of Lisuarte,\r\nKing of Britain. Spells incredible, combats with giants, miraculous\r\ninterpositions, form the tissue of episode, till fidelity is rewarded,\r\nand Amadís made happy.\r\n\r\nCervantes' Barber, classing the book as \"the best in that kind,\"\r\nsaved it from the holocaust, and posterity has accepted the Barber's\r\nsentence. _Amadís_ is at least the only chivalresque novel that\r\nman need read. The style is excellent, and, though the tale is too\r\nlong-drawn, the adventures are interesting, the supernatural machinery\r\nis plausibly arranged, and the plot is skilfully directed. Later\r\nstories are mostly burlesques of _Amadís_: the giants grow taller,\r\nthe monsters fiercer, the lakes deeper, the torments sharper. In his\r\n_Sergas de Esplandián_, Montalvo fails when he attempts to take up\r\nthe story at the end of _Amadís_. One tedious sequel followed another\r\ntill, within half a century, we have a thirteenth _Amadís_. The\r\nbest of its successors is Luis Hurtado's (or, perhaps, Francisco de\r\nMoraes') _Palmerín de Inglaterra_, which Cervantes' Priest would have\r\nkept in such a casket as \"that which Alexander found among Darius'\r\nspoils, intended to guard the works of Homer.\" Nor is this mere\r\nirony. Burke avowed in the House of Commons that he had spent much\r\ntime over _Palmerín_, and Johnson wasted a summer upon _Felixmarte de\r\nHircania_. Wearisome as the kind was, its popularity was so unbounded\r\nthat Hieronym Sempere, in the _Caballería cristiana_, applied the\r\nchivalresque formula to religious allegory, introducing Christ as\r\nthe Knight of the Lion, Satan as the Knight of the Serpent, and the\r\nApostles as the Twelve Knights of the Round Table. Of its class,\r\n_Amadís de Gaula_ is the first and best.\r\n\r\nFrom an earlier version of _Amadís_ derives the _Cárcel de Amor_ of\r\nDiego San Pedro, the writer of some erotic verses in the _Cancionero\r\nde burlas_. San Pedro tells the story of the loves of Leriano and\r\nLaureola, mingled with much allegory and chivalresque sentiment.\r\nThe construction is weak, but the style is varied, delicate, and\r\ndistinguished. Ending with a panegyric on women, \"who, no less than\r\ncardinals, bequeath us the theological virtues,\" the book was banned\r\nby the Inquisition. But nothing stayed its course, and, despite all\r\nprohibitions, it was reprinted times out of number. The _Cárcel de\r\nAmor_ ends with a striking scene of suicide, which was borrowed by many\r\nlater novelists.\r\n\r\nThe first instance of its annexation occurs in the _Tragicomedia de\r\nCalisto y Melibea_, better known as the _Celestina_. This remarkable\r\nbook, first published (as it seems) at Burgos, in 1499, has been\r\nclassed as a play, or as a novel in dialogue. Its length would make\r\nit impossible on the boards, and its influence is most marked on the\r\nnovel. As first published, it had sixteen acts, extended later to\r\ntwenty-one, and in some editions to twenty-two. On the authority of\r\nRojas, anxious as to the Inquisition, the first and longest act has\r\nbeen attributed to Mena and to Cota; but the prose is vastly superior\r\nto Mena's, while the verse is no less inferior to the lyrism of Cota's\r\n_Diálogo_. There is small doubt but that the whole is the work of the\r\nlawyer FERNANDO DE ROJAS, a native of Montalbán, who became Alcaide of\r\nSalamanca, and died, at a date unknown, at Talavera de la Reina.\r\n\r\nThe tale is briefly told. Calisto, rebuffed by Melibea, employs the\r\nprocuress Celestina, who arranges a meeting between the lovers. But\r\ndestiny works a speedy expiation: Celestina is murdered by Calisto's\r\nservants, Calisto is accidentally killed, and Melibea destroys herself\r\nbefore her father, whom she addresses in a set speech suggested by the\r\n_Cárcel de Amor_. Celestina is developed from Ruiz' Trota-conventos;\r\nRojas' lovers, Calisto and Melibea, from Ruiz' Melón and Endrina;\r\nand some hints are drawn from Alfonso Martínez de Toledo. But,\r\ndespite these borrowings, we have to deal with a completely original\r\nmasterpiece, unique in its kind. We are no longer in an atmosphere\r\nthick with impossible monsters in incredible circumstances: we are in\r\nthe very grip of life, in commerce with elemental, strait passions.\r\n\r\nRojas is the first Spanish novelist who brings a conscience to his\r\nwork, who aims at more than whiling away an idle hour. He is not great\r\nin incident, his plot is clumsily fashioned, the pedantry of his age\r\nfetters him; but in effects of artistry, in energy of phrasing, he\r\nis unmatched by his coevals. Though he invented the comic type which\r\nwas to become the _gracioso_ of Calderón, his humour is thin; on the\r\nother hand, his realism and his pessimistic fulness are above praise.\r\nChoosing for his subject the tragedy of illicit passion, he hit on\r\nthe means of exhibiting all his powers. His purpose is to give a\r\ntranscript of life, objective and impersonal, and he fulfils it, adding\r\nthereunto a mysterious touch of sombre imagination. His characters\r\nare not Byzantine emperors and queens of Cornwall: he traffics in\r\nthe passions of plain men and women, the agues of the love-sick, the\r\ncrafts of senile vice, the venality and vauntings of picaroons, the\r\neffrontery of croshabells. Hence, from the first hour, his book took\r\nthe world by storm, was imprinted in countless editions, was continued\r\nby Juan Sedeño and Feliciano da Silva—the same whose \"reason of the\r\nunreasonableness\" so charmed Don Quixote—was imitated by Sancho Muñón\r\nin _Lisandro y Roselia_, was used by Lope de Vega in the _Dorotea_, and\r\nwas passed from the Spanish stage to be glorified as _Romeo and Juliet_.\r\n\r\nBetween the years 1508-12 was composed the anonymous _Cuestión de\r\nAmor_, a semi-historical, semi-social novel wherein contemporaries\r\nfigure under feigned names, some of which are deciphered by the\r\nindustry of Signor Croce, who reveals Belisena, for example, as Bona\r\nSforza, afterwards Queen of Poland. Though much of its first success\r\nwas due to the curiosity which commonly attaches to any _roman à clef_,\r\nit still interests because of its picturesque presentation of Spanish\r\nsociety in Italian surroundings, and the excellence of its Castilian\r\nstyle was approved by that sternest among critics, Juan de Valdés.\r\n\r\nHistory is represented by the _Historia de los Reyes católicos_ of\r\nAndrés Bernáldez (d. 1513), parish priest of Los Palacios, near\r\nSeville, who relates with spirit and simplicity the triumphs of the\r\nreign, waxing enthusiastic over the exploits of his friend Columbus.\r\nA more ambitious historian is HERNANDO DEL PULGAR (1436-?1492), whose\r\n_Claros Varones de Castilla_ is a brilliant gallery of portraits,\r\ndrawn by an observer who took Pérez de Guzmán for his master. Pulgar's\r\n_Crónica de los Reyes católicos_ is mere official historiography, the\r\nwork of a flattering partisan, the slave of flagrant prejudice; yet\r\neven here the charm of manner is seductive, though the perdurable value\r\nof the annals is naught. As a portrait-painter, as an intelligent\r\nanalyst of character, as a wielder of Castilian prose, Pulgar ranks\r\nonly second to his immediate model. He is to be distinguished from\r\nanother Hernando del Pulgar (1451-1531), who celebrated the exploits of\r\nthe great captain, Gonzalo de Córdoba, at the request of Carlos V. In\r\nthis case, as in so many others, the old is better.\r\n\r\nOne great name, that of Christopher Columbus or CRISTÓBAL COLÓN\r\n(1440-1506) is inseparable from those of the Catholic kings, who\r\nastounded their enemies by their ingratitude to the man who gave them\r\na New World. Mystic and adventurer, Columbus wrote letters which are\r\nmarked by sound practical sense, albeit couched in the apocalyptic\r\nphrases of one who holds himself for a seer and prophet. Incorrect,\r\nuncouth, and rugged as is his syntax, he rises on occasion to heights\r\nof eloquence astonishing in a foreigner. But it is perhaps imprudent to\r\nclassify such a man as Columbus by his place of birth. An exception in\r\nmost things, he was probably the truest Spaniard in all the Spains; and\r\nby virtue of his transcendent genius, visible in word as in action, he\r\nis filed upon the bede-roll of the Spanish glories.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER VII\r\n\r\n                       THE AGE OF CARLOS QUINTO\r\n\r\n                               1516-1556\r\n\r\n\r\nWith the arrival of printing-presses in 1474 the diffusion of foreign\r\nmodels became general throughout Spain. The closing years of the reign\r\nof the Catholic Kings were essentially an era of translation, and\r\nthis movement was favoured by high patronage. The King, Fernando, was\r\nthe pupil of Vidal de Noya; the Queen, Isabel, studied under Beatriz\r\nGalindo, _la latina_; and Luis Vives reports that their daughter, Mad\r\nJuana, could and did deliver impromptu Latin speeches to the deputies\r\nof the Low Countries. Throughout the land Italian scholars preached\r\nthe gospel of the Renaissance. The brothers Geraldino (Alessandro and\r\nAntonio) taught the children of the royal house. Peter Martyr, the\r\nLombard, boasts that the intellectual chieftains of Castile sat at his\r\nfeet; and he had his present reward, for he ended as Bishop of Granada.\r\nFrom the Latin chair in the University of Salamanca, Lucio Marineo lent\r\nhis aid to the good cause; and, in Salamanca likewise, the Portuguese,\r\nArias Barbosa, won repute as the earliest good Peninsular Hellenist.\r\nSpanish women took the fever of foreign culture. Lucía de Medrano and\r\nJuana de Contreras lectured to university men upon the Latin poets\r\nof the Augustan age. So, too, Francisca de Nebrija would serve as\r\nsubstitute for her father, ANTONIO DE NEBRIJA (1444-1522), the greatest\r\nof Spanish humanists, the author of the _Arte de la Lengua Castellana_\r\nand of a Spanish-Latin dictionary, both printed in 1492. Nebrija\r\ntouched letters at almost every point, touching naught that he did not\r\nadorn; he expounded his principles in the new University of Alcalá de\r\nHenares, founded in 1508 by the celebrated Cardinal Francisco Jiménez\r\nde Cisneros (1436-1517). Palencia had preceded Nebrija by two years\r\nwith the earliest Spanish-Latin dictionary; but Nebrija's drove it from\r\nthe field, and won for its author a name scarce inferior to Casaubon's\r\nor Scaliger's.\r\n\r\nThe first Greek text of the New Testament ever printed came from\r\nAlcalá de Henares in 1514. In 1520 the renowned Complutensian Polyglot\r\nfollowed; the Hebrew and Chaldean texts being supervised by converted\r\nJews like Alfonso de Alcalá, Alfonso de Zamora, and Pablo Coronel; the\r\nGreek by Nebrija, Juan de Vergara, Demetrio Ducas, and Hernán Núñez,\r\n\"the Greek Commander.\" Versions of the Latin classics were in all men's\r\nhands. Palencia rendered Plutarch and Josephus, Francisco Vidal de Noya\r\ntranslated Horace, Virgil's _Eclogues_ were done by Encina, Cæsar's\r\n_Commentaries_ by Diego López de Toledo, Plautus by Francisco López\r\nVillalobos, Juvenal by Jerónimo de Villegas, and Apuleius' _Golden Ass_\r\nby Diego López de Cartagena, Archdeacon of Seville. Juan de Vergara\r\nwas busied on the text of Aristotle, while his brother, Francisco\r\nde Vergara, gave Spaniards their first Greek grammar and translated\r\nHeliodorus. Nor was activity restrained to dead languages: the Italian\r\nteachers saw to that. Dante was translated by Pedro Fernández de\r\nVillegas, Archdeacon of Burgos; Petrarch's _Trionfi_ by Antonio\r\nObregón and Álvar Gómez; and the _Decamerone_ by an anonymous writer of\r\nhigh merit.\r\n\r\nIf Italians invaded Spain, Spaniards were no less ready to settle\r\nin Italy. Long before, Dante had met with Catalans and had branded\r\ntheir proverbial stinginess:—\"_l'avara povertà di Catalogna_.\" A\r\nlittle later, and Boccaccio spurned Castilians as so many wild men:\r\n\"_semibarbari et efferati homines_.\" Lorenzo Valla, chief of the\r\nItalian scholars at Alfonso V.'s Neapolitan court, denounced the King's\r\ncountrymen as illiterates:—\"_a studiis humanitatis abhorrentes_.\"\r\nBenedetto Gareth of Barcelona (1450-?1514) plunged into the new\r\ncurrent, forswore his native tongue, wrote his respectable _Rime_ in\r\nItalian, and re-incarnated himself under the Italian form of Chariteo.\r\nA certain Jusquin Dascanio is represented by a song, half-Latin,\r\nhalf-Italian, in Asenjo Barbieri's _Cancionero Musical de los Siglos\r\nxv. y xvi._ (No. 68), and a few anonymous pieces in the same collection\r\nare written wholly in Italian. The Valencian, Bertomeu Gentil, and the\r\nCastilian, Tapia, use Italian in the _Cancionero General_ of 1527, the\r\nformer succeeding so far that one of his eighteen Italian sonnets has\r\nbeen accepted as Tansillo's by all Tansillo's editors. The case of the\r\nSpanish Jew, Judas Abarbanel, whom Christians call León Hebreo, is\r\nexceptional. Undoubtedly his famous _Dialoghi di amore_, that curious\r\nproduct of neo-platonic and Semitic mysticism which charmed Abarbanel's\r\ncontemporaries no less than it charmed Cervantes, reaches us in Italian\r\n(1535). Yet, since it was written in 1502, its foreign dress is the\r\nchance result of the writer's expulsion from Spain with his brethren in\r\n1492. It is unlikely that Judas Abarbanel should have mastered all the\r\nsecrets of Italian within ten years: that he composed in Castilian, the\r\nlanguage most familiar to him, is overwhelmingly probable.\r\n\r\nBut the Italian was met on his own ground. The Neapolitan poet, Luigi\r\nTansillo, declares himself a Spaniard to the core:—\"_Spagnuolo\r\nd'affezione_.\" And, later, Panigarola asserts that Milanese fops,\r\non the strength of a short tour in Spain, would pretend to forget\r\ntheir own speech, and would deliver themselves of Spanish words and\r\ntags in and out of season. Meanwhile, Spanish Popes, like Calixtus\r\nIII. and Alexander VI., helped to bring Spanish into fashion. It is\r\nunlikely that the epical _Historia Parthenopea_ (1516) of the Sevillan,\r\nAlonso Hernández, found many readers even among the admirers of the\r\nGreat Captain, Gonzalo de Córdoba, whose exploits are its theme; but\r\nit merits notice as a Spanish book issued in Rome, and as a poor\r\nimitation of Mena's _Trescientas_, with faint suggestions of an Italian\r\nenvironment. A Spaniard, whom Encina may have met upon his travels,\r\nintroduced Italians to the Spanish theatre. This was BARTOLOMÉ TORRES\r\nNAHARRO, a native of Torres, near Badajoz. Our sole information\r\nconcerning him comes from a Letter Prefatory to his works, written by\r\none Barbier of Orleans. The dates of his birth and death are unknown,\r\nand no proof supports the story that he was driven from Rome because\r\nof his satires on the Papal court. Neither do we know that he died in\r\nextreme poverty. These are baseless tales. What is certain is this:\r\nthat Torres Naharro, having taken orders, was captured by Algerine\r\npirates, was ransomed, and made his way to Rome about the year 1513.\r\nFurther, we know that he lived at Naples in the service of Fabrizio\r\nColonna, and that his collected plays were published at Naples in\r\n1517 with the title of _Propaladia_, dedicated to Francisco Dávalos,\r\nthe Spanish husband of Vittoria Colonna. That Torres Naharro was a\r\nfavourite with Leo X. rests on no better basis than the fact that in\r\nthe Pope's privilege to print he is styled _dilectus filius_.\r\n\r\nHis friendly witness, Barbier, informs us that, though Torres Naharro\r\nwas quite competent to write his plays in Latin, he chose Castilian of\r\nset purpose that \"he might be the first to write in the vulgar tongue.\"\r\nThis phrase, taken by itself, implies ignorance of Encina's work; in\r\nany case, Torres Naharro develops his drama on a larger scale than that\r\nof his predecessor. His _Prohemio_ or Preface is full of interesting\r\ndoctrine. He divides his plays into five acts, because Horace wills it\r\nso, and these acts he calls _jornadas_, \"because they resemble so many\r\nresting-points.\" The personages should not be too many: not less than\r\nsix, and not more than twelve. If the writer introduces some twenty\r\ncharacters in his _Tinellaria_, he excuses himself on the ground that\r\n\"the subject needed it.\" He further apologises for the introduction\r\nof Italian words in his plays: a concession to \"the place where, and\r\nthe persons to whom, the plays were recited.\" Lastly, Torres Naharro\r\ndivides dramas into two broad classes: first, the _comedia de noticia_,\r\nwhich treats of events really seen and noted; second, the _comedia de\r\nfantasía_, which deals with feigned things, imaginary incidents that\r\nseem true, and might be true, though in fact they are not so.\r\n\r\nOf the _comedia de fantasía_ Torres Naharro is the earliest master. He\r\nadventures on the allegorical drama in his _Trofea_, which commemorates\r\nthe exploits of Manoel of Portugal in Africa and India, and brings Fame\r\nand Apollo upon the stage. The chivalresque drama is represented by\r\nhim in such pieces as the _Serafina_, the _Aquilana_, the _Himenea_;\r\nwhile he examples the play of manners by the _Jacinta_ and the\r\n_Soldadesca_. Each piece begins with an _introyto_ or prologue, wherein\r\nindulgence and attention are requested; then follows a concise summary\r\nof the plot; last, the action opens. The faults of Torres Naharro's\r\ntheatre are patent enough: his tendency to turn comedy to farce, his\r\ninclination to extravagance, his want of tact in crowding his stage—as\r\nin the _Tinellaria_—with half-a-dozen characters chattering in\r\nhalf-a-dozen different languages at once.\r\n\r\nSetting aside these primitive humours, it is impossible to deny that\r\nTorres Naharro has a positive, as well as an historic value. His\r\nversification, always in the Castilian octosyllabic metre, with no\r\ntrespassing on the Italian hendecasyllabic, is neat and polished,\r\nand, though far from splendid, lacks neither sweetness nor speed; his\r\ndialogue is pointed, opportune, dramatic; his characters are observed\r\nand are set in the proper light. His verses entitled the _Lamentaciones\r\nde Amor_ are in the old, artificial manner; his satirical couplets\r\non the clergy are vigorous and witty attacks on the general life of\r\nRome; his devout songs are neither better nor worse than those of his\r\ncontemporaries; and his sonnets—two in Italian, one in a mixture of\r\nItalian and Latin—are mere curiosities of no real worth, yet they\r\ntestify to the writer's uncommon versatility. Versatile Torres Naharro\r\nunquestionably was, and his gift serves him in the plays for which he\r\nis remembered. He is the first Spaniard to realise his personages, to\r\ncreate character on the boards; the first to build a plot, to maintain\r\nan interest of action by variety of incident, to polish an intrigue, to\r\nconcentrate his powers within manageable limits, to view stage-effects\r\nfrom before the curtain. In a word, Torres Naharro knew the stage,\r\nits possibilities, and its resources. For his own age and for his\r\nopportunities he knew it even too well; and his _Himenea_—the theme\r\nof which is the love of Himeneo for Febea, with the interposition of\r\nFebea's brother, petulant as to the \"point of honour\"—is an isolated\r\nmasterpiece, unrivalled till the time of Lope de Vega. The accident\r\nthat Torres Naharro's _Propaladia_ was printed in Italy; the misfortune\r\nthat its Spanish reprints were tardy, and that his plays were too\r\ncomplicated for the primitive resources of the Spanish stage: these\r\ndelayed the development of the Spanish theatre by close on a century.\r\nYet the fact remains: to find a match for the _Himenea_ we must pass to\r\nthe best of Lope's pieces.\r\n\r\nThus the Spaniard in Italy. In Portugal, likewise, he made his way. GIL\r\nVICENTE (1470-1540), the Portuguese dramatist, wrote forty-two pieces,\r\nof which ten are wholly in Castilian, while fifteen are in a mixed\r\njargon of Castilian and Portuguese which the author himself ridicules\r\nas _aravia_ in his _Auto das Fadas_. An important historical fact is\r\nthat Vicente's earliest dramatic attempt, the _Monologo da Visitação_,\r\nis in Castilian, and that it was actually played—the first lay piece\r\never given in Portugal—on June 8, 1502. Its simplicity of tone and\r\nelegance of manner are reminiscent of Encina, and it can scarce be\r\ndoubted that Vicente's imitation is deliberate. Still more obvious\r\nis the following of Encina's eclogues in Vicente's _Auto pastoril\r\nCastelhano_ and the _Auto dos Reis Magos_, where the legend is treated\r\nwith Encina's curious touch of devotion and modernity, the whole\r\nclosing with a song in which all join. Once again Encina's influence\r\nis manifest in the _Auto da Sibilla Cassandra_, wherein Cassandra,\r\nniece of Moses, Abraham, and Isaiah, is wooed by Solomon. In _Amadís de\r\nGaula_ and in _Dom Duardos_ there is a marked advance in elaboration\r\nand finish; and in the _Auto da Fé_ Vicente proves his independence by\r\nan ingenuity and a fancy all his own. Here he displays qualities above\r\nthose of his model, and treats his subject with such brilliancy that,\r\na century and a half later, Calderón condescended to borrow from the\r\nPortuguese the idea of his _auto_ entitled _El Lirio y la Azucena_. Gil\r\nVicente is technically a dramatist, but he is not dramatic as Torres\r\nNaharro is dramatic. His action is slight, his treatment timid and\r\nconventional, and he is more poetic than inventive; still, his dramatic\r\nsongs are of singular beauty, conceived in a tone of mystic lyricism\r\nunapproached by those who went before him, and surpassed by few who\r\nfollowed. That Vicente was ever played in Spain is not known; but that\r\nhe influenced both Lope de Vega and Calderón is as sure as that he\r\nhimself was a disciple of Encina.\r\n\r\nA more immediate factor in the evolution of Spanish letters was the\r\nCatalan Boscá, whom it is convenient to call by his Castilian name,\r\nJUAN BOSCÁN ALMOGAVER (?1490-1542). A native of Barcelona, Boscán\r\nserved as a soldier in Italy, returned to Spain in 1519, and, as we\r\nknow from Garcilaso's Second Eclogue, was tutor to Fernando Álvarez\r\nde Toledo, whom the world knows as the Duque de Alba. Boscán's\r\nearliest verses are all in the old manner; nor does he venture\r\non the Italian hendecasyllabic till the year 1526, just before\r\nresigning his guardianship of Alba. His conversion was the work of\r\nthe Venetian ambassador, Andrea Navagiero, an accomplished courtier,\r\nill represented by his _Viaggio fatto in Spagna_. Being at Granada\r\nin the year 1526, Navagiero met Boscán, who has left us an account\r\nof the conversation:—\"Talking of wit and letters, especially of\r\ntheir varieties in different tongues, he inquired why I did not try\r\nin Castilian the sonnets and verse-forms favoured by distinguished\r\nItalians. He not only suggested this, but pressed me urgently to the\r\nattempt. Some days later, I made for home, and, because of the length\r\nand loneliness of the journey, thinking matters over, I returned to\r\nwhat Navagiero had said, and thus I first attempted this sort of verse;\r\nfinding it hard at the outset, since it is very intricate, with many\r\npeculiarities, varying greatly from ours. Yet, later, I fancied that I\r\nwas progressing well, perhaps because we all love our own essays; hence\r\nI continued, little by little, with increasing zeal.\" This passage is\r\na _locus classicus_. Ticknor justly observes that no single foreigner\r\never affected a national literature more deeply and more instantly\r\nthan Navagiero, and that we have here a first-hand account, probably\r\nunique in literary history, of the first inception of a revolution by\r\nthe earliest, if not the most conspicuous, actor in it. We have at\r\nlast reached the parting of the ways, and Boscán presents himself as\r\na guide to the Promised Land. The astonishing thing is that Boscán, a\r\nBarcelonese by birth and residence, ignores Auzías March.\r\n\r\nThere were many Italianates before Boscán—as Francisco Imperial and\r\nSantillana; but their hour was not propitious, and Boscán is with\r\njustice regarded as the leader of the movement. He was not a poet of\r\nsingular gifts, and he had the disadvantage of writing in Castilian,\r\nwhich was not his native language; but Boscán had the wit to see\r\nthat Castilian was destined to supremacy, and he mastered it for his\r\npurpose with that same dogged perseverance which led him to undertake\r\nhis more ambitious attempt unaided. He does not, indeed, appear to\r\nhave sought for disciples, nor were his own efforts as successful\r\nas he believed: \"perhaps because we all love our own essays.\" His\r\nCastilian prose is evidence of his gift of style, and his translation\r\nof Castiglione's _Cortegiano_ is a triumph of rendering fit to take\r\nits place beside our Thomas Hoby's version of the same original. But,\r\nit must be said frankly, that Boscán's most absolute success is in\r\nprose. Herrera bitterly taunts him with decking himself in the precious\r\nrobes of Petrarch, and with remaining, spite of all that he can do, \"a\r\nforeigner in his language.\" And the charge is true. In verse Boscán's\r\ndefects grow very visible: his hardness, his awkward construction, his\r\nunrefined ear, his uncertain touch upon his instrument, his boisterous\r\nexecution. Still, it is not as an original genius that Boscán finds\r\nplace in history, but rather as an initiator, a master-opportunist\r\nwho, without persuasion, by the sheer force of conviction and example,\r\nled a nation to abandon the ancient ways, and to admit the potency and\r\ncharm of exotic forms. That in itself constitutes a title, if not to\r\nimmortality, at least to remembrance.\r\n\r\nBoscán's influence manifested itself in diverse ways. His friend,\r\nGarcilaso de la Vega, sent him the first edition of Castiglione's\r\n_Cortegiano_, printed at Venice in 1528. This—\"the best book that\r\never was written upon good breeding,\" according to Samuel Johnson—was\r\ntriumphantly translated into Castilian by Boscán at Garcilaso's prayer;\r\nand, though Boscán himself held translation to be a thing meet for\r\n\"men of small parts,\" his rendering is an almost perfect performance.\r\nMoreover, it was the single work published by him (1534), for his poems\r\nappeared under his widow's care. Once more, in an epistle directed\r\nto Hurtado de Mendoza, Boscán re-echoes Horace's note of elegant\r\nsimplicity with a faithfulness not frequent in his work; and, lastly,\r\nit is known that he did into Castilian an Euripidean play, which,\r\nthough licensed for the press, was never printed. Truly it seems that\r\nBoscán was conscious of his very definite limitations, and that he\r\nfelt the necessity of a copy, rather than a direct model. If it were\r\nso, this would indicate a power of conscious selection, a faculty\r\nfor self-criticism which cannot be traced in his published verses.\r\nHis earlier poems, written in Castilian measures, show him for a\r\nman destitute of guidance, thrown on his own resources, a perfectly\r\nundistinguished versifier with naught to sing and with no dexterity of\r\nvocalisation. Yet, let Boscán betake himself to the poets of the Cinque\r\nCento, and he flashes forth another being: the dauntless adventurer\r\nsailing for unknown continents, inspired by the enthusiasm of immediate\r\nsuggestion.\r\n\r\nHis _Hero y Leandra_ is frankly based upon Musæus, and it is\r\ncharacteristic of Boscán's mode that he expands Musæus' three hundred\r\nodd hexameters into nigh three thousand hendecasyllabics. Professor\r\nFlamini has demonstrated most convincingly that Boscán followed Tasso's\r\n_Favola_, but he comes far short of Tasso's variety, distinction, and\r\ngrace. He annexes the Italian blank verse—the _versi sciolti_—as it\r\nwere by sheer force, but he never subdues the metre to his will, and\r\nhis monotony of accent and mechanical cadence grow insufferable. Not\r\nonly so: too often the very pretence of inspiration dissolves, and the\r\nwriter descends upon slothful prose, sliced into lines of regulation\r\nlength, honeycombed with flat colloquialisms. Conspicuously better is\r\nthe _Octava Rima_—an allegory embodying the Court of Love and the\r\nCourt of Jealousy, with the account of an embassage from the former to\r\ntwo fair Barcelonese rebels. Of this performance Thomas Stanley has\r\ngiven an English version (1652) from which these stanzas are taken:—\r\n\r\n  \"_In the bright region of the fertile east\r\n    Where constant calms smooth heav'n's unclouded brow,\r\n  There lives an easy people, vow'd to rest,\r\n    Who on love only all their hours bestow:\r\n  By no unwelcome discontent opprest,\r\n    No cares save those that from this passion flow,\r\n  Here reigns, here ever uncontroll'd did reign;\r\n  The beauteous Queen sprung from the foaming main._\r\n\r\n  _Her hand the sceptre bears, the crown her head,\r\n    Her willing vassals here their tribute pay:\r\n  Here is her sacred power and statutes spread,\r\n    Which all with cheerful forwardness obey:\r\n  The lover by affection hither led,\r\n    Receives relief, sent satisfied away:\r\n  Here all enjoy, to give their last flames ease,\r\n  The pliant figure of their mistresses ..._\r\n\r\n  _Love every structure offers to the sight,\r\n    And every stone his soft impression wears.\r\n  The fountains, moving pity and delight,\r\n    With amorous murmurs drop persuasive tears.\r\n  The rivers in their courses love invite,\r\n    Love is the only sound their motion bears.\r\n  The winds in whispers soothe these kind desires,\r\n  And fan with their mild breath Love's glowing fires._\"\r\n\r\nTicknor ranks this as \"the most agreeable and original of Boscán's\r\nworks,\" and as to the correctness of the first adjective there can\r\nbe no two opinions. But concerning Boscán's originality there is much\r\nto say. Passage upon passage in the _Octava Rima_ is merely a literal\r\nrendering of Bembo's _Stanze_, and the translation begins undisguised\r\nat the opening line. Where the Italian writes, \"_Ne l'odorato e lucido\r\nOriente_,\" the Spaniard follows him with the candid transcription, \"_En\r\nel lumbroso y fértil Oriente_\"; and the imitation is further tesselated\r\nwith mosaics conveyed from Claudian, from Petrarch, and Ariosto.\r\nNone the less is it just to say that the conveyance is executed with\r\nconsiderable—almost with masterly—skill. The borrowing nowise\r\nbelittles Boscán; for he was not—did not pose as—a great spirit\r\nwith an original voice. He makes no claim whatever, he seeks for no\r\napplause—the shy, taciturn experimentalist who published never a line\r\nof verse, and piped for his own delight. Equipped with the ambition,\r\nthough not with the accomplishment, of the artist, Boscán has a prouder\r\nplace than he ever dreamed of, since he is confessedly the earliest\r\nrepresentative of a new poetic dynasty, the victorious leader of a\r\ndesperately forlorn hope. That title is his laurel and his garland.\r\nHe led his race into the untrodden ways, triumphing without effort\r\nwhere men of more strenuous faculty had failed; and his results have\r\nsuccessfully challenged time, inasmuch as there has been no returning\r\nfrom his example during nigh four hundred years. Not a great genius,\r\nnot a lordly versifier, endowed with not one supreme gift, Boscán ranks\r\nas an unique instance in the annals of literary adventure by virtue of\r\nhis enduring and irrevocable victory.\r\n\r\nHis is the foremost post in point of time. In point of absolute merit\r\nhe is easily outshone by his younger comrade, GARCILASO DE LA VEGA\r\n(1503-36), the bearer of a name renowned in Spanish chronicle and song.\r\nGrandson of Pérez de Guzmán, Garcilaso entered the Royal Body-guard in\r\nhis eighteenth year. He quitted him like the man he was in crushing\r\ndomestic rebellion, and, despite the fact that his brother, Pedro,\r\nserved in the insurgent ranks, Garcilaso grew into favour with the\r\nEmperor.\r\n\r\nAt Pavia, where Francis lost all save honour, Garcilaso distinguished\r\nhimself by his intrepidity. For a moment he fell into disgrace\r\nbecause of his connivance at a secret marriage between his cousin\r\nand one of the Empress' Maids of Honour: interned in an islet on the\r\nDanube,—_Danubio, rio divino_, he calls it,—he there composed one\r\nof his most admired pieces, richly charged with exotic colouring. His\r\nimprisonment soon ended, and, with intervals of service before Tunis,\r\nand with spells of embassies between Spain and Italy, his last years\r\nwere mostly spent at Naples in the service of the Spanish Viceroy,\r\nPedro de Toledo, Marqués de Villafranca, father of Garcilaso's friend,\r\nthe Duque de Alba. In the Provençal campaign the Spanish force was held\r\nin check by a handful of yeomen gathered in the fort of Muy, between\r\nDraguignan and Fréjus. Muy recalls to Spanish hearts such memories\r\nas Zutphen brings to Englishmen. In itself the engagement was a mere\r\nskirmish: for Garcilaso it was a great and picturesque occasion. The\r\naccounts given by Navarrete and García Cerezeda vary in detail, but\r\ntheir general drift is identical. The last of the Spanish Cæsars named\r\nhis personal favourite, the most dashing of Spanish soldiers and the\r\nmost distinguished of Spanish poets, to command the storming-party.\r\nDoffing his breastplate and his helmet that he might be seen by all\r\nbeholders—by the Emperor not less than by the army—Garcilaso led\r\nthe assault in person, was among the first to climb the breach, and\r\nfell mortally wounded in the arms of Jerónimo de Urrea, the future\r\ntranslator of Ariosto, and of his more intimate friend, the Marqués de\r\nLombay, whom the world knows best as St. Francis Borgia. He was buried\r\nwith his ancestors in his own Toledo, where, as even the grudging\r\nGóngora allows, every stone within the city is his monument.\r\n\r\nHis illustrious descent, his ostentatious valour, his splendid\r\npresence, his seductive charm, his untimely death: all these, joined\r\nto his gift of song, combine to make him the hero of a legend and the\r\nidol of a nation. Like Sir Philip Sidney, Garcilaso personified all\r\naccomplishments and all graces. He died at thirty-three: the fact must\r\nbe borne in mind when we take account of his life's work in literature.\r\nYet Europe mourned for him, and the loyal Boscán proclaimed his debt\r\nto the brilliant soldier-poet. Pleased as the Catalan was with his\r\nnovel experiments, he avows he would not have persevered \"but for the\r\nencouragement of Garcilaso, whose decision—not merely to my mind, but\r\nto the whole world's—is to be taken as final. By praising my attempts,\r\nby showing the surest sign of approval through his acceptance of my\r\nexample, he led me to dedicate myself wholly to the undertaking.\"\r\nBoscán and Garcilaso were not divided by death. The former's widow, Ana\r\nGirón de Rebolledo, gave her husband's verses to the press in 1543;\r\nand, more jealous for the fame of her husband's friend than were any of\r\nhis own household, she printed Garcilaso's poems in the Fourth Book.\r\n\r\nGarcilaso is eminently a poet of refinement, distinction, and\r\ncultivation. What Boscán half knew, Garcilaso knew to perfection, and\r\nhis accomplishment was wider as well as deeper.[6] Living his last\r\nyears in Naples, Garcilaso had caught the right Renaissance spirit, and\r\nis beyond all question the most Italianate of Spanish poets in form\r\nand substance. He was not merely the associate of such expatriated\r\ncountrymen as Juan de Valdés: he was the friend of Bembo and Tansillo,\r\nthe first of whom calls him the best loved and the most welcome of\r\nall the Spaniards that ever came to Italy. To Tansillo, Garcilaso was\r\nattached by bonds of closest intimacy, and the reciprocal influence\r\nof the one upon the other is manifest in the works of both. This\r\nassociation would seem to have been the chief part of Garcilaso's\r\nliterary training. His few flights in the old Castilian metres, his\r\nsongs and _villancicos_, are of small importance; his finest efforts\r\nare cast in the exotic moulds. It is scarcely an exaggeration to say\r\nthat fundamentally he is a Neapolitan poet.\r\n\r\nThe sum of his production is slight: the inconsiderable _villancicos_,\r\nthree eclogues, two elegies, an epistle, five highly elaborated songs,\r\nand thirty-eight Petrarchan sonnets. Small as is his work in bulk,\r\nit cannot be denied that it was like nothing before it in Castilian.\r\nAuzías March, no doubt, had earlier struck a similar note in Catalan,\r\nand Garcilaso, who seems to have read everything, imitates his\r\npredecessor's harmonies and cadences. His trick of reminiscence is\r\nremarkable. Thus, his first eclogue is plainly suggested by Tansillo;\r\nhis second eclogue is little more than a rendering in verse of picked\r\npassages from the _Arcadia_ of Jacopo Sannazaro; while the fifth of\r\nhis songs—_La Flor de Gnido_—is a most masterly transplantation of\r\nBernardo Tasso's structure to Castilian soil. And almost every page is\r\ntouched with the deliberate, conscious elegance of a student in the\r\nschool of Horace. In simple execution Garcilaso is impeccable. The\r\nobjection most commonly made is that he surrenders his personality, and\r\nconverts himself into the exquisite echo of an exhausted pseudo-classic\r\nconvention. And the charge is plausible.\r\n\r\nIt is undeniably true that Garcilaso's distinction lacks the force\r\nof real simplicity, that his eternal sweetness cloys, and that the\r\nthing said absorbs him less than the manner of saying it. He would\r\nhave met the criticism that he was an artificial poet by pointing\r\nout that, poetry being an art, it is of essence artificial. That he\r\nwas an imitative artist was his highest glory: by imitating foreign\r\nmodels he attained his measure of originality, enriching Spain, with\r\nnot merely a number of technical forms but a new poetic language.\r\nWithout him Boscán must have failed in his emprise, as Santillana\r\nfailed before him. Besides his technical perfection, Garcilaso owned\r\nthe poetic temperament—a temperament too effeminately delicate for the\r\nvulgarities of life. As he tells us in his third eclogue, he lived,\r\n\"now using the sword, now the pen:\"—\r\n\r\n  \"_Tomando ora la espada, ora la pluma._\"\r\n\r\nBut the clank of the sabre is never heard in the fiery soldier's verse.\r\nHis atmosphere is not that of battle, but is rather the enchanted haze\r\nof an Arcadia which never was nor ever could be in a banal world. As\r\nthus, in Wiffen's version:—\r\n\r\n  \"_Here ceased the youth his Doric madrigal,\r\n  And sighing, with his last laments let fall\r\n  A shower of tears; the solemn mountains round,\r\n  Indulgent of his sorrow, tossed the sound\r\n  Melodious from romantic steep to steep,\r\n  In mild responses deep;\r\n  Sweet Echo, starting from her couch of moss,\r\n  Lengthened the dirge; and tenderest Philomel,\r\n  As pierced with grief and pity at his loss,\r\n  Warbled divine reply, nor seemed to trill\r\n  Less than Jove's nectar from her mournful bill.\r\n  What Nemoroso sang in sequel, tell,\r\n  Ye sweet-voiced Sirens of the sacred hill._\"\r\n\r\nThis is, in a sense, \"unnatural\"; but if we are to condemn it as such,\r\nwe must even reject the whole school of pastoral, a convention of which\r\nthe sixteenth century was enamoured. When Garcilaso introduced himself\r\nas Salicio, and, under the name of Nemoroso, presented Boscán (or, as\r\nHerrera will have it, Antonio de Fonseca), he but took the formula as\r\nhe found it, and translated it in terms of genius. He was consciously\r\nreturning upon nature; not upon the material facts of existence as it\r\nis, but upon a figmentary nature idealised into a languid and ethereal\r\nbeauty. He sought for effects of suavest harmony, embodying in his song\r\na mystic neo-platonism, the _morbidezza_ of \"love in the abstract,\" set\r\noff by grace and sensibility and elfin music. It may be permissible\r\nfor the detached critic to appreciate Garcilaso at something less than\r\nhis secular renown, but this superior attitude were unlawful and\r\ninexpedient for an historical reviewer.\r\n\r\nTime and unanimity settle many questions: and, after all, on a\r\nmatter concerning Castilian poetry, the unbroken verdict of the\r\nCastilian-speaking race must be accepted as weighty, if not final.\r\nGarcilaso may not be a supreme singer; he is at least one of the\r\ngreatest of the Spanish poets. Choosing to reproduce the almost\r\ninimitable cadences of the Virgilian eclogue, he achieves his end with\r\na dexterity that approaches genius. Others before him had hit upon\r\nwhat seemed \"pretty i' the Mantuan\": he alone suggests the secret\r\nof Virgil's brooding, incommunicable, and melancholy charm. What\r\nBoscán saw to be possible, what he attempted with more good-will than\r\nfortune, that Garcilaso did with an instant and peremptory triumph.\r\nHe naturalised the sonnet, he enlarged the framework of the song, he\r\ninvented the ode, he so bravely arranged his lines of seven and eleven\r\nsyllables that the fascination of his harmonies has led historians\r\nto forget Bernardo Tasso's priority in discovering the resources of\r\nthe _lira_. In rare, unwary moments he lets fall an Italian or French\r\nidiom, nor is he always free from the pedantry of his time; but\r\nabsolute perfection is not of this world, and is least to be asked of\r\none who, writing in moments stolen from the rough life of camps, died\r\nat thirty-three, full of immense promise and immense possibilities. To\r\nspeculate upon what Garcilaso might have become is vanity. As it is,\r\nhe survives as the Prince of Italianates, the acknowledged master of\r\nthe Cinque Cento form. Cervantes and Lope de Vega, agreed upon nothing\r\nelse, are at one in holding him for the first of Castilian poets. With\r\nslight reservations, their judgment has been sustained, and even to-day\r\nthe sweet-voiced, amatorious paladin leaves an abiding impress upon\r\nthe character of his national literature.\r\n\r\nAn early sectary of the school is discovered in the person of the\r\nPortuguese poet, FRANCISCO DE SÂ DE MIRANDA (1495-1558), who so\r\nfrequently forsakes his native tongue that of 189 pieces included in\r\nMme. Carolina Michaëlis de Vasconcellos' edition, seventy-four are\r\nin Castilian. Sâ de Miranda's early poems written before 1532—the\r\n_Fábula de Mondego_, the _Canção á Virgem_, and the eclogue entitled\r\n_Aleixo_—are in the old manner. His later works, such as _Nemoroso_,\r\nwith innumerable sonnets and the three elegies composed between 1552\r\nand 1555, are all undisguised imitations of Boscán and Garcilaso, for\r\nwhom the writer professes a rapturous enthusiasm. Sâ de Miranda ranks\r\namong the six most celebrated Portuguese poets; and, stranger though\r\nhe be, even in Castilian literature he distinguishes himself by his\r\ncorrectness of form, by his sincerity of sentiment, and by a genuine\r\nlove of natural beauty very far removed from the falsetto admiration\r\ntoo current among his contemporaries.\r\n\r\nThe soldier, GUTIERRE DE CETINA (1520-60) is another partisan of the\r\nItalian school. Serving in Italy, he pursued his studies to the best\r\nadvantage, and won friendship and aid from literary magnates like the\r\nPrince of Ascoli, and Diego Hurtado de Mendoza; but soldiering was\r\nlittle to his taste, and, after a campaign in Germany, Cetina retired\r\nto his native Seville, whence he passed to Mexico about the year 1550.\r\nHe is known to have written in the dramatic form, but no specimen of\r\nhis drama survives, unless it be sepultured in some obscure Central\r\nAmerican library. Cetina is a copious sonneteer who manages his\r\nrhyme-sequences with more variety than his predecessors, and his songs\r\nand madrigals are excellent specimens of finished workmanship. His\r\ngeneral theme is Arcadian love—the beauty of Amaríllida, the piteous\r\npassion of the shepherd Silvio, the grief of the nymph Flora for\r\nMenalca. His treatment is always ingenious, his frugality in the matter\r\nof adjectives is edifying, though it scandalised the exuberant Herrera,\r\nwho, as a true Andalucían, esteems emphasis and epithet and metaphor as\r\nthe three things needful. Cetina's sobriety is paid for by a certain\r\npreciosity of utterance near akin to weakness; but he excels in the\r\nsonnet form, which he handles with a mastery superior to Garcilaso's\r\nown, and he adds a touch of humour uncommon in the mannered school that\r\nhe adorns.\r\n\r\nFERNANDO DE ACUÑA (? 1500-80) comes into notice as the translator\r\nof Olivier de la Marche's popular allegorical poem, the _Chevalier\r\nDélibéré_, a favourite with Carlos Quinto. The Emperor is said to have\r\namused himself by translating the French poem into Spanish prose,\r\nand to have commissioned Acuña to a poetic version. A courtier like\r\nVan Male gives us to understand that some part of Acuña's _Caballero\r\ndeterminado_ is based upon the Emperor's prose rendering, and the\r\ninsinuation is that Acuña and his master should share the praise of\r\nthe former's exploit. This pleasant tale is scarce plausible, for we\r\nknow that the Cæsar never mastered colloquial Castilian, and that he\r\nshould shine in its literary exercise is almost incredible. Be that\r\nas it may, Acuña's _Caballero determinado_, a fine example of the old\r\n_quintillas_, met with wide and instant appreciation; yet he never\r\nsought to follow up his triumph in the same kind. The new influence\r\nwas irresistible, and Acuña succumbed to it, imitating the _lira_ of\r\nGarcilaso to the point of parody, singing as \"Damon in absence,\"\r\npractising the pastoral, aspiring to Homer's dignity in his blank\r\nverses entitled the _Contienda de Ayax Telamonio y de Ulises_. Three\r\nCastilian cantos of Boiardo's _Orlando Innamorato_ won applause in\r\nItaly; but Acuña's best achievements are his sonnets, which are almost\r\nalways admirable. One of them contains a line as often quoted as any\r\nother in all Castilian verse:—\r\n\r\n  \"_Un Monarca, un Imperio, y una Espada,_\"\r\n\r\n\"One Monarch, one Empire, and one Sword.\" And this pious aspiration\r\nafter unity had perhaps been fulfilled if Spain had abounded with such\r\nprudent and accomplished figures as Fernando de Acuña.\r\n\r\nA more powerful and splendid personality is that of the illustrious\r\nDIEGO HURTADO DE MENDOZA (1503-1575), one of the greatest figures in\r\nthe history of Spanish politics and letters. Educated for the Church at\r\nthe University of Salamanca, Mendoza preferred the career of arms, and\r\nfound his opportunity at Pavia and in the Italian wars. Before he was\r\ntwenty-nine he was named Ambassador to the Venetian Republic, became\r\nthe patron of the Aldine Press, and studied the classics with all the\r\nardour of his temperament. One of the few Spaniards learned in Arabic,\r\nMendoza was a distinguished collector: he ransacked the monastery of\r\nMount Athos for Greek manuscripts, secured others from Sultan Suliman\r\nthe Magnificent, and had almost all Bessarion's Greek collection\r\ntranscribed for his own library, now housed in the Escorial. The first\r\ncomplete edition of Josephus was printed from Mendoza's copies. He\r\nrepresented the Emperor at the Council of Trent, and saw to it that\r\nCardinals and Archbishops did what Spain expected of them. In 1547 he\r\nwas appointed Plenipotentiary to Rome, where he treated Pope Julius\r\nIII. as cavalierly as his Holiness was accustomed to treat his own\r\ncurates. In 1554 Mendoza returned to Spain, and the accession of Felipe\r\nII. in 1556 brought his public career to a close. He is alleged to have\r\nbeen Ambassador to England; and one would fain the report were true.\r\n\r\nHis wit and picaresque malice are well shown in his old-fashioned\r\n_redondillas_; which delighted so good a judge as Lope de Vega, and\r\nhis real strength lay in his management of these forms. But his long\r\nItalian residence and his sleepless intellectual curiosity ensured his\r\nexperimenting in the high Roman manner. Tibullus, Horace, Ovid, Virgil,\r\nHomer, Pindar, Anacreon: all these are forced into Mendoza's service,\r\nas in his epistles and his _Fábula de Adonis, Hipómenes y Atalanta_.\r\nIt cannot be said that he is at his best in these pseudo-classical\r\nperformances, and he dares to eke out his hendecasyllabics by using a\r\nfinal _palabra aguda_; but the extreme brilliancy of the humour carries\r\noff all technical defects in the burlesque section of his poems, which\r\nare of the loosest gaiety, most curious in a retired proconsul. Yet, if\r\nMendoza, who excelled in the old, felt compelled to pen his forty odd\r\nsonnets in the new style, how strong must have been its charm! Whatever\r\nhis formal defects, Mendoza's authority was decisive in the contest\r\nbetween the native and the foreign types of verse: he helped to secure\r\nthe latter's definitive triumph.\r\n\r\nThe greatest rebel against the invasion was CRISTÓBAL DE CASTILLEJO (?\r\n1494-1556), who passed thirty years abroad in the service of Ferdinand,\r\nKing of Bohemia. Much of his life was actually spent in Italy, but\r\nhe kept his national spirit almost absolutely free from the foreign\r\ninfluence. If he compromises at all, the furthest he can go is in\r\nadopting the mythological machinery favoured by all contemporaries, and\r\neven for this he could plead respectable Castilian precedent; but in\r\nthe matter of form, Castillejo is cruelly intransigent. Boscán is his\r\nespecial butt.\r\n\r\n  \"_Él mismo confesará\r\n  Que no sabe donde va_\"—\r\n\r\n\"He himself will confess that he knows not whither he goes.\" That,\r\nindeed, appears to have been Castillejo's fixed idea on the subject,\r\nand he expends an infinite deal of sarcasm and ridicule upon the\r\napostates who, as he thinks, hide their poverty of thought in tawdry\r\nmotley. His own subjects are perfectly fitted to treatment in the\r\n_villancico_ form, and when he is not simply improper—as in _El Sermón\r\nde los Sermones_—his verses are remarkable for their sprightly grace\r\nand bitter-sweet wit, which can, at need, turn to rancorous invective\r\nor to devotional demureness. Had he lived in Spain, it is probable that\r\nCastillejo's mordant ridicule might have delayed the Italian supremacy.\r\nAs it was, his flouts and jibes arrived too late, and the old patriot\r\ndied, as he had lived, a brilliant, impenitent, futile Tory.\r\n\r\nIn one of his sonnets, conceived in the most mischievous spirit of\r\ntravesty, Castillejo singles out for reprobation a poet named Luis de\r\nHaro, as one of the Italian agitators. Unluckily Haro's verses have\r\npractically disappeared from the earth, and the few specimens preserved\r\nin Nájera's _Cancionero_ are banal exercises in the old Castilian\r\nmanner. A practitioner more after Castillejo's heart was the ingenious\r\nAntonio de Villegas (fl. 1551), whose _Inventario_, apart from tedious\r\nparaphrases of the tale of Pyramus and Thisbe in the style of Bottom\r\nthe Weaver, contains many excellent society-verses, touched with\r\nconceits of extreme sublety, and a few more serious efforts in the\r\nform of _décimas_, not without a grave urbanity and a penetration of\r\ntheir own. Francisco de Castilla, a contemporary of Villegas, vies with\r\nhim in essaying the hopeless task of bringing the old rhythms into\r\nnew repute; but his _Teórica de virtudes_, dignified and elevated in\r\nstyle and thought, had merely a momentary vogue, and is now unjustly\r\nconsidered a mere bibliographical curiosity.\r\n\r\nA student in both schools was the Portuguese GREGORIO SILVESTRE\r\n(1520-70), choirmaster and organist in the Cathedral of Granada,\r\nwho, beginning with a boy's admiration for Garci Sánchez and Torres\r\nNaharro, practised the _redondilla_ with such success as to be esteemed\r\nan expert in the art. A certain Pedro de Cáceres y Espinosa, in a\r\n_Discurso_ prefixed to Silvestre's poems (1582), tells us that his\r\nauthor \"imitated Cristóbal de Castillejo, in speaking ill of the\r\nItalian arrangements,\" and that he cultivated the novelties for the\r\npractical reason that they were popular. It is certain that Silvestre\r\nis as attractive in the new as in the old kind, that his elegance never\r\nobscures his simplicity, that he shows a rare sense of ordered outline,\r\nan exceptional finish in the technical details of both manners. His\r\nconversion is the last that need be recorded here. The _villancico_\r\nstill found its supporters among men of letters, and, as late as\r\nthe seventeenth century, both Cervantes and Lope de Vega profess a\r\nplatonic attachment to it and kindred metres; but the public mind was\r\nset against a revival, and Cervantes and Lope were forced to abandon\r\nany idea (if, indeed, they ever entertained it) of breathing life into\r\nthese dead bones.\r\n\r\nDidactic prose was practised, according to the old tradition, by Juan\r\nLópez de Vivero Palacios Rubios, who published in 1524 his _Tratado\r\ndel esfuerzo bélico heróico_, a pseudo-philosophic inquiry into the\r\norigin and nature of martial valour, written in a clear and forcible\r\nstyle. Francisco López de Villalobos (1473-1549), a Jewish convert\r\nattached to the royal household as physician, began by translating\r\nPliny's _Amphitruo_ in such fashion as to bring down on him the\r\nthunders of Hernán Núñez. Villalobos works the didactic vein in his\r\nrhymed _Sumario de Medicina_ which Ticknor ignores, though he mentions\r\nits late derivatives, the _Trescientas preguntas_ of Alonso López de\r\nCorelas (1546) and the _Cuatrocientas respuestas_ of Luis de Escobar\r\n(1552). But the witty physician's most praiseworthy performance is\r\nhis _Tratado de las tres Grandes_—namely, talkativeness, obstinacy,\r\nand laughter—where his familiar humour, his frolic, fantasy, and\r\nperverse acuteness far outshine the sham philosophy and the magisterial\r\nintention of his other work. A graver talent is that of Fernando\r\nPérez de Oliva (1492-1530), once lecturer in the University of Paris,\r\nand, later, Rector of Salamanca, who boasts of having travelled three\r\nthousand leagues in pursuit of culture. His _Diálogo de la Dignidad del\r\nHombre_, written to show that Castilian is as good a vehicle as the\r\nmore fashionable Latin for the discussion of transcendental matters,\r\nis an excellent example of cold, stately, Ciceronian prose, and the\r\ncontinuation by his friend, Francisco Cervantes de Salazar, is worthy\r\nof the beginning; but the hold of ecclesiastical Latin was too fast to\r\nbe loosed at a first attempt.\r\n\r\nOliva's reputation is strictly Spanish: not so that of Carlos Quinto's\r\nofficial chronicler, ANTONIO DE GUEVARA (d. 1545), a Franciscan monk\r\nwho held the bishopric of Mondoñedo. His _Reloj de Príncipes_ (Dial\r\nof Princes), a didactic novel with Marcus Aurelius for its hero, was\r\noriginally composed to encourage his own patron to imitate the virtues\r\nof the wisest ancient. Unluckily, however, Guevara passed his book off\r\nas authentic history, alleging it to be a translation of a non-existent\r\nmanuscript in the Florentine collection. This brought him into trouble\r\nwith antagonists as varied as the court-fool, Francesillo de Zúñiga,\r\nand a Sorian professor, the Bachelor Pedro de Rhua, whose _Cartas\r\ncensorias_ unmasked the imposture with malignant astuteness. But this\r\ncritical faculty was confined to the Peninsula, and North's English\r\ntranslation, dedicated to Mary Tudor, popularised Guevara's name in\r\nEngland, where he is believed by some authorities to have exercised\r\nconsiderable influence on the style of English prose. This, however,\r\nis not the place to discuss that most difficult question. An instance\r\nof Guevara's better manner is offered by his _Década de los Césares_,\r\nthough even here he interpolates his own unscrupulous inventions\r\nand embellishments, as he also does in his _Familiar Epistles_,\r\nEnglished by Edward Hellowes, Groom of the Leash, from whose version\r\nan illustration may be borrowed:—\"The property of love is to turn\r\nthe rough into plain, the cruel to gentle, the bitter to sweet, the\r\nunsavoury to pleasant, the angry to quiet, the malicious to simple, the\r\ngross to advised, and also the heavy to light. He that loveth, neither\r\ncan he murmur of him that doth anger him: neither deny that they ask\r\nhim: neither resist when they take from him: neither answer when they\r\nreprove him: neither revenge if they shame him: neither yet will he\r\nbe gone when they send him away.\" These pompous commonplaces abound\r\nin the _Familiar Epistles_, which, though still the most readable of\r\nGuevara's performances, are tedious in their elaborate accumulation of\r\nsaws and instances, unimpressively collected from the four quarters of\r\nthe earth. But the rhetorical letters went the round of the world, were\r\ntranslated times out of number, and were commonly called \"The Golden\r\nLetters,\" to denote their unique worth.\r\n\r\nMore serious and less attractive historians are Pedro Mexía\r\n(1496-1552), whose _Historia Imperial y Cesárea_ is a careful\r\ncompilation of biographies of Roman rules from Cæsar to Maximilian,\r\nand Florián de Ocampo (1499-1555), canon of Zamora, and an official\r\nchronicler, who, taking the Deluge as his starting-point, naturally\r\nenough fails to bring his dry-as-dust annals later than Roman times,\r\nand endeavours to follow the critical canons of his time with better\r\nintention than performance. The _Comentarios de la Guerra en Alemania_\r\nof Luis de Ávila y Zúñiga are valuable as containing the evidence of an\r\nacute, direct observer of events; but Ávila's exaggerated esteem for\r\nhis master causes him to convert his history into an elaborate apology.\r\nCarlos Quinto's own dry criticism of the book is final:—\"Alexander's\r\nachievements surpassed mine—but he was less lucky in his chronicler.\"\r\nThe conquest of America begot a crowd of histories, of which but few\r\nneed be named here. González Fernández de Oviedo y Valdés (1478-1557),\r\nonce secretary to the Great Captain, gives an official picture of the\r\nNew World in his _Historia general y natural de Indias_, and a similar\r\nstudy from an opposed and higher point of view is to be found in the\r\nwork of Bartolomé de las Casas, Bishop of Chiapa (1474-1566), whose\r\npassionate eloquence on behalf of the American Indians is displayed in\r\nhis _Brevísima relación de la destrucción de Indias_ (1552); but here\r\nagain history declines into polemics, the offices of judge and advocate\r\noverlapping. The famous HERNÁN CORTÉS (1485-1554), _El Conquistador_,\r\nwas a man of action; but his official reports on Mexico and its\r\naffairs are drawn up with exceeding skill, and in energy of phrase and\r\nluminous concision may stand as models in their kind. Cortés found his\r\npanegyrist in his chaplain, Francisco López de Gómara (1519-60), whose\r\ninteresting _Conquista de Méjico_ is an uncritical eulogy on his chief,\r\nwhom he extols at the expense of his brother adventurers. The antidote\r\nwas supplied by BERNAL DÍAZ DEL CASTILLO (fl. 1568), whose _Historia\r\nverdadera de la conquista de la Nueva España_ is a first-class example\r\nof military indignation. \"Here the chronicler Gómara in his history\r\nsays just the opposite of what really happened. Whoso reads him will\r\nsee that he writes well, and that, with proper information, he could\r\nhave stated his facts correctly: as it is, they are all lies.\" The\r\nmanifest honesty and simplicity of the old soldier, who shared in one\r\nhundred and nineteen engagements and could not sleep unless in armour,\r\nare extremely winning; his prolix ingenuousness has been admirably\r\nrendered in our day by a descendant of the Conquistadores, M. José\r\nMaría Heredia, whose French version is a triumph of translation.\r\n\r\nIncredible tales from the Western Indies stimulated the popular\r\nappetite for miracles in terms of fiction. Paez de Ribera added a sixth\r\nbook to _Amadís_, under the title of _Florisando_ (1510); Feliciano de\r\nSilva wrote a seventh, ninth, tenth, and eleventh—_Lisuarte_ (1510),\r\n_Amadís de Grecia_ (1530), _Florisel de Niquea_ (1532), and _Rogel de\r\nGrecia_; and he would certainly have supplied the eighth book had he\r\nnot been anticipated by Juan Díaz with a second _Lisuarte_. Parallel\r\nwith _Amadís_ ran the series of _Palmerín de Oliva_ (1511), which\r\ntradition ascribes to an anonymous lady of Augustobriga, but which\r\nmay just as well be the work of Francisco Vázquez de Ciudad Rodrigo,\r\nas it is said to be in its first descendant _Primaleón_ (1512).\r\n_Polindo_ (1526) continues the tale, and an unknown author pursues it\r\nin the _Crónica del muy valiente Platir_ (1533), while _Palmerín de\r\nInglaterra_ (1547-48) closes the cycle. Curious readers may study this\r\nlast in the English version of Anthony Munday (1616), who commends\r\nit as an excellent and stately history, \"wherein gentlemen may find\r\nchoice of sweet inventions, and gentlewomen be satisfied in courtly\r\nexpectations.\" These are but a few of the extravagances of the press,\r\nand the madness spread so wide that Carlos Quinto, admirer as he was\r\nof _Don Belianís de Grecia_, was forced to protect the New World\r\nagainst invasion by books of this class. Scarcely less numerous are the\r\ncontinuations of the _Celestina_, due to the indefatigable Feliciano de\r\nSilva, to Gaspar Gómez de Toledo, to Sancho Muñoz, and others.\r\n\r\nA new species begins with the first picaroon novel, _Lazarillo de\r\nTormes_, long ascribed to Diego Hurtado de Mendoza, an attribution\r\nnow commonly rejected on the authority of that distinguished Spanish\r\nscholar, M. Alfred Morel-Fatio. There is something to be said in favour\r\nof Mendoza's claim which may not be said for lack of space. As to\r\n_Lazarillo de Tormes_, authorship, date and place of publication are\r\nall uncertain: the three earliest editions known appeared at Antwerp,\r\nBurgos, and Alcalá de Henares in 1554. It is the autobiography of\r\nLázaro, son of the miller, Tomé González, and the trull, Antonia\r\nPérez. He describes his adventures as leader of a blind man, as servant\r\nto a miserly priest, to a starving gentleman, to a beggar-monk, to a\r\nvendor of indulgences, to a signboard painter, to an alguazil, ending\r\nhis career in a Government post—_un oficio real_—as town-crier\r\nof Toledo. There we leave him \"at the height of all good fortune.\"\r\nLázaro's experience with the hungry hidalgo may be quoted from the\r\nadmirable archaic rendering by David Rowland, of Anglesea:—\r\n\r\n\"It pleased God to accomplish my desire and his together, for when as I\r\nhad begun my meat, as he walked, he came near to me, saying: 'Lázaro,\r\nI promise thee thou hast the best grace in eating that ever I did see\r\nany man have; for there is no man that seest thee eat, but seeing thee\r\nfeed, shall have appetite, although they be not a-hungered.' Then\r\nwould I say to myself, 'The hunger which thou sustainest causeth thee\r\nto think mine so beautiful.' Then I trusted I might help him, seeing\r\nthat he had so helped himself, and had opened me the way thereto.\r\nWherefore I said unto him, 'Sir, the good tools make the workmen good:\r\nthis bread hath good taste, and this neat's-foot is so well sod, and\r\nso cleanly dressed, that it is able, with the flavour of it only, to\r\nentice any man to eat of it.' 'What? is it a neat's-foot?' 'Yes, sir.'\r\n'Now, I promise thee it is the best morsel in the world: there is no\r\npheasant that I would like so well.' 'I pray thee, sir, prove of it\r\nbetter and see how you like it.'... Whereupon he sitteth down by me,\r\nand then began to eat like one that hath great need, gnawing every one\r\nof those little bones better than any greyhound could have done for\r\nlife, saying, 'This is a singular good meal: by God, I have eaten it\r\nwith a good stomach, as if I had eaten nothing all this day before.'\r\nThen I, with a low voice, said, 'God send me to live long as sure as\r\nthat is true.' And, having ended his victuals, he commanded me to reach\r\nhim the pot of water, which I gave him even as full as I had brought it\r\nfrom the river.... We drank both, and went to bed, as the night before,\r\nat that time well satisfied. And now, to avoid long talk, we continued\r\nafter this sort eight or nine days. The poor gentleman went every day\r\nto brave it out in the street, to content himself with his accustomed\r\nstately pace, and always I, poor Lázaro, was fain to be his purveyor.\"\r\n\r\nWritten in the most debonair, idiomatic Castilian, _Lazarillo de\r\nTormes_ condenses into nine chapters the cynicism, the wit, and the\r\nresource of an observer of genius. After three hundred years, it\r\nsurvives all its rivals, and may be read with as much edification and\r\namusement as on the day of its first appearance. It set a fashion, a\r\nfashion that spread to all countries, and finds a nineteenth-century\r\nmanifestation in the pages of _Pickwick_; but few of its successors\r\nmatch it in satirical humour, and none approach it in pregnant\r\nconcision, where no word is superfluous, and where every word tells\r\nwith consummate effect. Whoever wrote the book, he fixed for ever the\r\ntype of the comic prose epic as rendered by the needy, and he did it\r\nin such wise as to defy all competition. Yet ill-advised competitors\r\nwere found: one, who has the grace to hide his name, at Antwerp,\r\ncontinuing Lázaro's adventures by exhibiting the gay scamp as a tunny,\r\nand a certain Juan de Luna, who, so late as 1620, converted Lázaro to a\r\nsea-monster on show.\r\n\r\nMysticism finds two distinguished exponents, of whom the earlier is\r\nthe Apostle of Andalucía, the Venerable JUAN DE ÁVILA (1502-69), a\r\npriest, who, educated at the University of Alcalá, is famous for his\r\nsanctity, his evangelic missions in Granada, Córdoba, and Seville.\r\nThe merest accident prevented his sailing for the New World in the\r\nsuite of the Bishop of Tlaxcala, and his inopportune fervour led to\r\nhis imprisonment by the Inquisition. Most of his religious treatises,\r\nbeautiful as they are, are too technical for our purpose here; but\r\nhis _Cartas Espirituales_ are redolent of religious unction combined\r\nwith the wisest practical spirit, the most sagacious counsel, and the\r\nrarest loving-kindness. Long practice in exhorting crowds of unlettered\r\nsinners had purged Juan de Ávila's style of the Asiatic exuberance in\r\nfavour with Guevara and other contemporaries; and, though he considered\r\nletters a vanity, his own practice shows him to be a master in the\r\naccommodation of the lowliest, most familiar language to the loftiest\r\nsubject.\r\n\r\nIn the opposite camp is JUAN DE VALDÉS (d. 1541), attached in some\r\ncapacity to the court of Carlos Quinto, and suspect of heterodox\r\ntendencies in the eyes of all good Spaniards. Francisco de Encinas\r\nreports that Valdés found it convenient to leave Spain on account of\r\nhis opinions; but, as his twin-brother, Alfonso, continued in the\r\nservice of Carlos Quinto, and as Juan himself lived unmolested at Rome\r\nand Naples from 1531 to his death, this story cannot be accepted. None\r\nthe less is it certain that Valdés, possibly through his friendship\r\nwith Erasmus, was drawn into the current of the Reformation. His\r\nearliest work, written, perhaps, in collaboration with his brother,\r\nis the anonymous _Diálogo de Mercurio y Carón_ (1528), an ingenious\r\nfable in Lucian's manner, abounding in political and religious malice,\r\ncharged with ridicule of abuses in Church and State. Apart from its\r\npolemical value, it is indisputably the finest prose performance of the\r\nreign. Boscán's version of the _Cortegiano_ most nearly vies with it;\r\nbut Valdés excels Boscán in the artful construction of his periods, in\r\nthe picturesqueness and moderation of his epithets, in the variety of\r\nhis cadence, and in the refined selection of his means. It is possible\r\nthat Cervantes, at his best, may match Valdés; but Cervantes is one\r\nof the most unequal writers in the world, while Valdés is one of the\r\nmost scrupulous and vigilant. Hence, sectarian prejudice apart, Valdés\r\nmust be accounted, if not absolutely the first, at least among the very\r\nfirst masters of Castilian prose.\r\n\r\nA curious fact in connection with one of Valdés' most popular works,\r\nthe _Ciento y diez Consideraciones divinas_, is that it has never been\r\nprinted in its original Castilian.[7] Even so the book was translated\r\ninto English by Nicholas Farrer (1638), and found favour in the eyes of\r\nGeorge Herbert, who commends Signior Iohn Valdesso as \"a true servant\r\nof God,\" \"obscured in his own country,\" and brought by God \"to flourish\r\nin this land of light and region of the Gospel, among His chosen.\" It\r\nmay be expedient to give an illustration of Valdés from the version\r\nto which Herbert stood sponsor:—\"Here I will add this. That, as\r\nliberality is so annexed to magnanimity that he cannot be magnanimous\r\nthat is not liberal, so hope and charity are so annexed unto faith\r\nthat it is impossible that he should have faith who hath not hope and\r\ncharity; it being also impossible that one should be just without\r\nbeing holy and pious. But of these Christian virtues they are not\r\ncapable who have not experience in Christian matters, which they only\r\nhave who, by the gift of God and by the benefit of Christ, have faith,\r\nhope, and charity, and so are pious, holy, and just in Christ.\" The\r\nArian flavour of this work explains its non-appearance in Castilian,\r\nand we must suppose that Herbert esteemed it for its austere doctrinal\r\nasceticism rather than its crude anti-trinitarianism. A Quaker before\r\nhis time, Valdés owes no small part of his recent vogue to Wiffen, who\r\nfirst heard of the _Consideraciones_ through a friend as an \"old work\r\nby a Spaniard, which represented essentially the principles of George\r\nFox.\" Whatever its defects, it is the one logical presentation of the\r\ndogmas of German mysticism, at the same time that it is a powerful,\r\nsearching psychological study of the springs of motives and the\r\ninnermost recesses of the human heart.\r\n\r\nIn another and a less contested field, we owe to Valdés the admirable\r\n_Diálogo de la Lengua_, written at Naples in 1535-36. The personages\r\nare four: two Italians, named Marcio and Coriolano; and two Spaniards,\r\nValdés himself, and a Spanish soldier, called indifferently Pacheco\r\nand Torres. For all purposes this dialogue is as important a monument\r\nof literary criticism as was the conversation in Don Quixote's library\r\nbetween the Priest and the Barber. In almost every case posterity has\r\nratified the personal verdict of Valdés, who approves himself the\r\nearliest, as well as one of the most impartial and most penetrating\r\namong Spanish critics. Moreover, he conducts his dialogue with\r\nextraordinary dramatic skill in the true vein of highest comedy. The\r\ncourtly grace of the two Italians, the military swagger of Pacheco,\r\nthe unwearied sagacity, the patrician wit and disdainful coolness of\r\nValdés himself, are given with incomparable lightness of touch and\r\nfelicity of accent. For the first time in Castilian literature we have\r\nto do with a man of letters, urbane from study, and accomplished from\r\ncommerce with a various world. Valdés overtops all the literary figures\r\nof Carlos Quinto's reign in natural gift and acquired accomplishment;\r\nnor in later times do we easily find his match.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[6] Garcilaso's forty-eight Latin stanzas, written after the Danubian\r\nimprisonment, are sufficiently unknown to justify a brief quotation\r\nhere. They occur in Antonius Thylesius' _Opera_ (Naples, 1762), pp.\r\n128-129: _Garcilassi di Vega Toletani ad Antonium Thylesium_:—\r\n\r\n    \"_Uxore, natis, fratribus et solo\r\n  Exul relictis, frigida per loca\r\n  Musarum alumnus, barbarorum\r\n  Ferre superbiam, et insolentes\r\n    Mores coactus jam didici, et invia\r\n  Per saxa voce in geminantia\r\n  Fletusque, sub rauco querelas\r\n  Murmure Danubii levare._\"\r\n\r\n\r\n[7] Boehmer gives thirty-nine _Consideraciones_ in the _Tratatidos_\r\n(Bonn, 1880); for the sixty-fifth see Menéndez y Pelayo, _Historia de\r\nlos Heterodoxos Españoles_ (Madrid, 1880), vol. ii. p. 375.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                             CHAPTER VIII\r\n\r\n                         THE AGE OF FELIPE II.\r\n\r\n                               1556-1598\r\n\r\n\r\nIn Spain, as elsewhere, the secular battle waged between classicism\r\nand romanticism. As poets sided with Boscán and Garcilaso, or with\r\nCastillejo, so dramatists declared for the _uso antiguo_ or for the\r\n_uso nuevo_. The partisans of the \"old usage\" put their trust in\r\nprose translations. We have already seen that the roguish Villalobos\r\ntranslated the _Amphitruo_ of Plautus, and Pérez de Oliva not only\r\nrepeated the performance, but gave a version of Euripides' _Hecuba_.\r\nEncina's successor was found in the person of Miguel de Carvajal, whose\r\n_Josefina_ deals, in classic fashion, with the tale of Joseph and his\r\nbrethren. Carvajal draws character with skill, and his dialogue lives;\r\nbut he is best remembered for his division of the play into four acts.\r\nEditions of Vasco Díaz Tanco de Fregenal are of such extreme rarity\r\nas to be practically inaccessible. So are the _Vidriana_ of Jaime de\r\nHuete and the _Jacinta_ of Agustín Ortiz—two writers who are counted\r\nas followers of Torres Naharro. A farce by the brilliant reactionary,\r\nCristóbal de Castillejo, entitled _Costanza_, is only known in extract,\r\nand is as remarkable for ribaldry as for good workmanship. The _Preteo\r\ny Tibaldo_ of Pero Álvarez de Ayllón and the _Silviana_ of Luis Hurtado\r\nare insipid pastorals. Many contemporary plays, known only by rumour,\r\nhave disappeared—suppressed, no doubt, because of their coarseness.\r\nTorres Naharro's _Propaladia_ was interdicted in 1540, and, eight\r\nyears later, the Cortes of Valladolid petitioned that a stop be put to\r\nthe printing of immoral comedies. The prayer was heard. Scarce a play\r\nof any sort survives, and the few that reach us exist in copies that\r\nare almost unique. The time for the stage was not yet. It is possible\r\nthat, had Carlos Quinto resided habitually in some Spanish capital, a\r\nnational theatre might have grown up; but the lack of Court patronage\r\nand the classical superstition delayed the evolution of the Spanish\r\ndrama. This comes into being during the reign of Felipe _el Prudente_.\r\n\r\nEncina's precedence in the sacred pastoral is granted; but his eclogues\r\nwere given before small, aristocratic audiences. We must look elsewhere\r\nfor the first popular dramatist, and Lope de Vega, an expert on\r\ntheatrical matters, identifies our man. \"Comedies,\" says Lope, \"are no\r\nolder than Rueda, whom many now living have heard.\" The gold-beater,\r\nLOPE DE RUEDA (fl. 1558), was a native of Seville. A prefatory sonnet\r\nto his _Medora_, written by Francisco Ledesma, informs us that Rueda\r\ndied at Córdoba, and Cervantes adds the detail that he was buried in\r\nthe cathedral there. This would go to show that a Spanish comedian was\r\nnot then a pariah; unluckily, the cathedral archives do not corroborate\r\nthe story. Taking to the boards, Lope de Rueda rose to be an _autor\r\nde comedias_—an actor-manager and playwright. Cervantes, who speaks\r\nenthusiastically of Rueda's acting, describes the material conditions\r\nof the scene. \"In the days of this famous Spaniard, the whole equipment\r\nof an _autor de comedias_ could be put in a bag: it consisted of four\r\nwhite sheepskins edged with gilt leather, four beards and wigs, and\r\nfour shepherd's-staves, more or less.... No figure rose, or seemed to\r\nrise, from the bowels of the earth or from the space under the stage,\r\nwhich was built up by four benches placed square-wise, with four or\r\nsix planks on top, about four hand's-breadths above ground. Still\r\nless were clouds lowered from the sky with angels or spirits. The\r\ntheatrical scenery was an old blanket, hauled hither and thither by\r\ntwo cords. This formed what they called the _vestuario_, behind which\r\nwere the musicians, who sang some old _romance_ without a guitar.\" This\r\naccount is substantially correct, though official documents in the\r\nSeville archives go to prove that Cervantes unconsciously exaggerated\r\nsome details—a thing natural enough in a man recalling memories\r\nfifty years old. A passage in the _Crónica del Condestable Miguel\r\nLucas Iranzo_ implies that women appeared in the early _momos_ or\r\n_entremeses_. But Spaniards inherited the Arab notion that women are\r\nbest indoors. The fact that Rueda was the first man to choose his pitch\r\nin the public place, and to appeal to the general, would explain his\r\nsubstitution of boys for girls in the female characters. Rueda was the\r\nfirst in Spain to bring the drama into the day. One of his personages\r\nin _Eufemia_—the servant Vallejo—makes a direct appeal to the\r\npublic:—\"Ye who listen, go and dine, and then come back to the square,\r\nif you wish to see a traitor's head cut off and a true man set free.\"\r\nThenceforward the theatre becomes a popular institution.\r\n\r\nLope de Rueda is often called _el excelente poeta_, and his verse\r\nis exampled in the _Prendas de Amor_, as also in the _Diálogo sobre\r\nla Invención de las Calzas_. The _Farsa del Sordo_, included by the\r\nMarqués de la Fuensanta del Valle in his admirable new edition of\r\nRueda's works, is almost certainly due to another hand. Cervantes\r\ncommends Rueda's _versos pastoriles_, but these only reach us in the\r\nfragment which Cervantes himself quotes in _Los Baños de Argel_.\r\nStill, it is not as a poet that Rueda lives: he is rightly remembered\r\nas the patriarch of the Spanish stage. For his time and station he\r\nwas well read: López Madera will have it that he knew Theocritus, and\r\nit may be so. More manifest are the Plautine touches in the _paso_\r\nwhich Moratín names _El Rufián Cobarde_, with its bully, Sigüenza,\r\na lineal descendant of the _Miles Gloriosus_. It has been inferred\r\nthat, in choosing Italian themes, Rueda followed Torres Naharro.\r\nThis gives a wrong impression, for his debt to the Italians is far\r\nmore direct. The _Eufemia_ takes its root in the _Decamerone_, being\r\nidentical in subject with _Cymbeline_; the _Armelina_ is compounded of\r\nAntonio Francesco Ranieri's _Attilia_, with Giovanni Maria Cecchi's\r\n_Servigiale_; the _Engaños_ is a frank imitation of Niccolò Secchi's\r\n_Commedia degli Inganni_; and the _Medora_ is conveyed straight from\r\nGigio Arthenio Giancarli's _Zingara_.[8]\r\n\r\nNeither in his fragments of verse nor in his Italian echoes is the true\r\nRueda revealed. His historic importance lies in his invention of the\r\n_paso_—a dramatic interlude turning on some simple episode: a quarrel\r\nbetween Torubio and his wife Águeda concerning the price of olives not\r\nyet planted, an invitation to dinner from the penniless licentiate\r\nXaquima. Rueda's most spirited work is given in the _Deleitoso\r\nCompendio_ (1567) and in the _Registro de Representantes_ (1570), both\r\npublished by his friend, Juan de Timoneda. In a longer flight the\r\neffect is less pleasing; the prose _Coloquio de Camila_ and its fellow,\r\nthe _Coloquio de Timbria_, are long _pasos_, complicated in development\r\nand not drawn to scale. Still, even here there is a keen dramatic sense\r\nof situation; while the comic extravagance of the themes—farcical\r\nincidents in picaresque surroundings—is set off by spirited dialogue\r\nand vigorous style. Rueda had clearly read the _Celestina_ to his\r\nprofit; and his prose, with its archaic savour, is of great purity\r\nand power. The patriotic Lista comes as near flat blasphemy as a good\r\nSpaniard may by mentioning Rueda in the same breath as Cervantes, and\r\nthat the latter learned much from his predecessor is manifest; but the\r\npoint need be pressed no further. Considerable as were Rueda's positive\r\nqualities of gay wit and inventive resource, his highest merit lies in\r\nthis, that he laid the foundation-stone of the actual Spanish theatre,\r\nand that his dramatic system became a capital factor in his people's\r\nintellectual history.\r\n\r\nHe found instant imitators: one in a brother actor-manager, Alonso\r\nde la Vega (d. 1566), whose _Tolomea_ is adapted from _Medora_; the\r\nother in Luis de Miranda (fl. 1554), who dramatised the story of\r\nthe Prodigal, to which, in a monstrous fit of realism, he gave a\r\ncontemporary setting. Of Pedro Navarro or Naharro, whom Cervantes ranks\r\nafter Rueda, naught survives. Francisco de Avendaño's verse comedy\r\nconcerning Floriseo and Blancaflor had long since been forgotten were\r\nit not for the fact that here, for the first time, a Spanish play is\r\ndivided into three acts—a convention which has endured, and for which\r\nlater writers, like Artieda, Virués, and Cervantes, ingenuously claimed\r\nthe credit. JUAN DE TIMONEDA (d. ? 1598), the Valencian bookseller who\r\nprinted Rueda's _pasos_, is a sedulous mimic in every sort. He began by\r\narranging Plautus' _Comedy of Errors_ in _Los Menecmos_; his _Cornelia_\r\nis based upon Ariosto's _Nigromante_; and his _Oveja Perdida_ adapts\r\nan early morality on the Lost Sheep with scarcely a suggestion of\r\noriginal treatment. Torres Naharro is the inspiration of Timoneda's\r\n_Aurelia_; but his chief tempter was Lope de Rueda. In the volume\r\nentitled _Turiana_ (1565), issued under the anagrammatic name of Joan\r\nDiamonte, he attempts the _paso_ (which he also calls the _entremés_)\r\nto good purpose. An imitator he remains; but an imitator whose pleasant\r\nhumour takes the place of invention, and whose lively prose dialogue\r\nis in excellent contrast with his futile verse. His _Patrañuelo_, a\r\ncollection of some twenty traditional stories, is a well-meant attempt\r\nto satisfy the craving created by _Lazarillo de Tormes_. If Timoneda\r\nexperimented in every field, it is not unjust to infer that, taking\r\nthe tradesman's view of literature, he was moved less by intelligent\r\ncuriosity than by the desire to supply his customers with novelties.\r\nWithal, if he be not individual, his unpolished drolleries are vastly\r\nmore engaging than the ambitious triflings of many contemporaries.\r\n\r\nPacheco, the father-in-law of Velázquez, notes that Juan de Malara\r\n(1527-71) composed \"many tragedies\" both in Latin and Castilian; and\r\nCueva, in his _Ejemplar poético_, gives the number hyperbolically:—\r\n\r\n  \"_En el teatro mil tragedias puso._\"\r\n\r\nThat Malara, or any one save Lope de Vega, \"placed a thousand tragedies\r\non the boards,\" is incredible; but by general consent his fecundity\r\nwas prodigious. None of his plays survives, and we are left to gather,\r\nfrom a chance remark of the author's, that he wrote a tragedy entitled\r\n_Absalón_ and another drama called _Locusta_. His repute as a poet\r\nmust be accepted, if at all, on authority; for his extant imitations\r\nof Virgil and renderings of Martial are mere technical exercises.\r\nFor us he is best represented by his _Filosofía vulgar_ (1568), an\r\nadmirable selection made from the six thousand proverbs brought\r\ntogether by Hernán Núñez, who thus continued what Santillana had begun.\r\nA contemporary, Blasco de Garay (fl. 1553), had striven to prove the\r\nresources of the language by printing, in his _Cartas de Refranes_,\r\nthree ingenious letters wholly made up of proverbial phrases; and in\r\nour own day the incomparable wealth of Castilian proverbs has been\r\nshown in Sbarbi's _Refranero General_ and in Haller's _Altspanische\r\nSprichtwörter_. But no later and fuller collection has supplanted\r\nMalara's learned and vivacious commentary.\r\n\r\nHis friend, JUAN DE LA CUEVA DE GAROZA of Seville (?1550-?1606),\r\nmatched Malara in productiveness, and perhaps surpassed him in talent.\r\nLittle is known of Cueva's life, save that he had certain love passages\r\nwith Brígida Lucía de Belmonte, and that he became almost insane\r\nfor a short while after her death. He distinguishes himself by his\r\nindependence of the Senecan example, which he roundly declares to be\r\nat once inartistic and tedious (_cansada cosa_), and by urging the\r\nSpanish dramatists to abjure abstractions and to treat national themes\r\nwithout regard for Greek and Latin superstitions. Incident, character,\r\nplot, situation, variety: these are to be developed with small regard\r\nfor \"the unities\" of the classic model. And Cueva carried out his\r\ndoctrines. Ignoring Carvajal, he took a special pride in reducing\r\nplays from five acts to four, and he enriched the drama by introducing\r\na multitude of metrical forms hitherto unknown upon the stage. The\r\ncunning fable of the people—_la ingeniosa fábula de España_—is\r\nillustrated in his _Siete Infantes de Lara_, in his _Cerco de Zamora_\r\n(Siege of Zamora), where he utilises subjects enshrined in _romances_\r\nwhich half his audience knew by heart. It is literally true that he\r\nhad been preceded by Bartolomé Palau, who, as far back as 1524, had\r\nwritten a play on a national subject—the _Historia de la gloriosa\r\nSanta Orosia_, published in 1883 by Fernández-Guerra y Orbe; but this\r\nwas an isolated, fruitless essay, whereas Cueva's was a deliberate,\r\nwell-organised attempt to shape the drama anew and to quicken it\r\ninto active life. Nor did Cueva's mission end with indicating the\r\npossibilities of dramatic motive afforded by heroico-popular songs and\r\nlegends. His _Saco de Roma y Muerte de Borbón_ exploits an historical\r\nactuality by dramatising Carlos Quinto's Italian triumphs (1527-30);\r\nand his _El Infamador_ (The Calumniator) not merely foreshadows the\r\n_comedia de capa y espada_, but gives us in his libertine, Leucino, the\r\nfirst sketch of the type which Tirso de Molina was to eternalise as Don\r\nJuan.\r\n\r\nIt is certain that Cueva was often less successful in performance than\r\nin doctrine, and that his gods and devils, his saints and ruffians,\r\ntoo often talk in the same lofty vein—the vein of Juan de la Cueva.\r\nIt is no less certain that he improvises recklessly, placing his\r\ncharacters in difficulties whence escape is impossible, and that\r\nhe takes the first solution that offers—a murder, a supernatural\r\ninterposition—with no heed for plausibility. But his bombast is the\r\ntrick of his school, and, to judge by his epical _Conquista de la\r\nBética_ (1603), he showed remarkable self-suppression in his plays.\r\nIn his later years, after visiting the Western Indies, he seems to\r\nhave abandoned the theatre which he had so courageously developed,\r\nand to have wasted himself upon his epic and the poor confection of\r\nold ballads which he published in the ten books entitled _Coro Febeo\r\nde Romances historiales_. Yet, despite these backslidings, he merits\r\ngratitude for his dramatic initiative.\r\n\r\nThe Galician Dominican, Gerónimo Bermúdez (1530-89), apologises for his\r\npresentation in Castilian of the _Nise Lastimosa_, which he published\r\nunder the name of Antonio de Silva in 1577. Bermúdez has seemingly done\r\nlittle more than rearrange the _Inez de Castro_ of the distinguished\r\nPortuguese poet, Antonio Ferreira, who had died eight years earlier.\r\nThough this \"correct\" play has tirades of remarkable beauty in the\r\nSenecan manner, its loose construction unfits it for the stage. All\r\nthat it contains of good is due to Ferreira, and its continuation—the\r\n_Nise Laureada_—is a mere collection of incoherent extravagances and\r\nbrutalities, conceived in Thomas Kyd's most frenzied mood.\r\n\r\nThe Captain ANDRÉS REY DE ARTIEDA (1549-1613) is said to have been\r\nborn at Valencia, and he certainly died there; yet Lope de Vega,\r\nonce his friend, speaks of him as a native of Zaragoza. Artieda was\r\na brilliant soldier, who received three wounds at Lepanto, and his\r\nconspicuous bravery was shown in the Low Countries, where he swam the\r\nEms in mid-winter under the enemy's fire, with his sword between his\r\nteeth. He is known to have written plays entitled _Amadís de Gaula_ and\r\n_Los Encantos de Merlín_, but his one extant drama is _Los Amantes_:\r\nthe first appearance on the stage of those lovers of Teruel who were\r\ndestined to attract Tirso de Molina, Montalbán, and Hartzenbusch.\r\nArtieda is essentially a follower of Cueva's, and he has something of\r\nhis model's clumsy manipulation; but his dramatic instinct, his pathos\r\nand tenderness, are his personal endowment. In his own day he was an\r\ninnovator in his kind: his opposition to the methods of Lope made him\r\nunpopular, and condemned him to an unmerited neglect, which he bitterly\r\nresented in the miscellaneous _Discursos, epístolas y epigramas_,\r\npublished by him (1605) under the name of Artemidoro.\r\n\r\nAnother dramatist and friend of Lope de Vega's was the Valencian\r\nCaptain CRISTÓBAL DE VIRUÉS (1550-1610), Artieda's comrade at Lepanto\r\nand in the Low Countries. Unfortunately for himself, Virués had his\r\nshare of learning, and misused it in his _Semíramis_, an absurd\r\nmedley of pedantry and horror. His _Átila Furioso_, involving more\r\nslaughter than many an outpost engagement, is the maddest caricature of\r\nromanticism. He appears to think that indecency is comedy, and that the\r\nway to terror lies through massacre. It is the eternal fault of Spain,\r\nthis forcing of the note; and it would seem that Virués repented him in\r\n_Elisa Dido_, where he returns to the apparatus of the Senecan school.\r\nYet, with all their defects, his earlier attempts were better, inasmuch\r\nas they presaged a new method, and a determination to have done with a\r\nsterile formula. He essayed the epic in his _Historia del Monserrate_,\r\nand once more courted disaster by his choice of subject: the outrage\r\nand murder of the Conde de Barcelona's daughter by the hermit Juan\r\nGarín, the Roman pilgrimage of the assassin, and the miraculous\r\nresurrection of his victim. As in his plays, so in his epic, Virués is\r\nan inventor without taste, brilliant in a single page and intolerable\r\nin twenty. His tactless fluency bade for applause at any cost, and\r\nhis incessant care to startle and to terrify results in a monstrous\r\nmonotony. Yet, if he failed himself, his exaggerated protest encouraged\r\nothers to seek a more perfect way, and, though he had no direct\r\ninfluence on the stage, he is interesting as an embodied remonstrance.\r\n\r\nHis mantle was caught by Joaquín Romero de Cepeda of Badajoz (fl.\r\n1582), whose _Selvajía_ is a dramatic arrangement of the _Celestina_,\r\nwith extravagant episodes suggested by the chivalresque novels; and\r\nin the opposite camp is the Aragonese LUPERCIO LEONARDO DE ARGENSOLA\r\n(1559-1613), whom Cervantes esteemed almost as good a dramatist as\r\nhimself—which, from Cervantes' standpoint, is saying much. Cervantes\r\npraises Argensola, not merely because his plays \"delighted and amazed\r\nall who heard them,\" but for the practical reason that \"these three\r\nalone brought in more money than thirty of the best given since their\r\ntime.\" If it be uncharitable to conceive that this aims at Lope de\r\nVega, we are bound to suppose that Argensola's popularity was immense.\r\nIt was also fleeting. His _Filis_ has disappeared, and his _Isabela_\r\nand _Alejandra_ were not printed till 1772, when López de Sedano\r\nincluded them in his _Parnaso Español_. The _Alejandra_ is a tissue\r\nof butcheries, and the _Isabela_ is scarcely better, the nine chief\r\ncharacters being killed out of hand. Argensola's excuse is that he\r\nwas only a lad of twenty when he perpetrated these iniquities; where,\r\nfor the rest, he already proves himself endowed with that lyrical\r\ngift which was to win for him the not excessive title of \"the Spanish\r\nHorace.\" But he was never reconciled to his defeat as a dramatist, and\r\nhe avenged himself in 1597 by inditing a spiteful letter to the King,\r\npraying that the prohibition of plays on the occasion of the Queen\r\nof Piedmont's death should be made permanent. The urbanity of men of\r\nletters is, it will be seen, constant everywhere.\r\n\r\n                   *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe school founded by Boscán and Garcilaso spread into Portugal,\r\nand bifurcated into Spanish factions settled in Salamanca and in\r\nSeville. BALTASAR DE ALCÁZAR (1530-1606), who served under that stout\r\nsea-dog the Marqués de Santa Cruz, is technically an adherent of the\r\nSevillan sect; but his laughing muse lends herself with an ill grace\r\nto artificial sentiment, and is happiest in stinging epigrams, in\r\nrisky jests, and in gay _romances_. DIEGO GIRÓN (d. 1590), a pupil of\r\nMalara's, is an ardent Italianate: prompt to challenge comparison with\r\nGarcilaso by reproducing Corydon and Tirsis from the seventh Virgilian\r\neclogue, to mimic Seneca—\"him of Córdoba dead\"—or to echo the note of\r\nGiorolamo Bosso. His verses, mostly hidden away among the annotations\r\nmade by Herrera in his edition of Garcilaso, deserve to be better known\r\nfor specimens of sound craftsmanship.\r\n\r\nThe greatest poet of the Sevillan group is indisputably FERNANDO DE\r\nHERRERA (1534-97), who comes into touch with England as the writer of\r\nan eulogy on Sir Thomas More. Cleric though he were, Herrera dedicated\r\nmuch of his verse (1582) to Leonor de Milán, Condesa de Gelves, wife\r\nof Álvaro de Portugal, himself a fashionable versifier. Herrera being\r\na clerk in minor orders, the situation is piquant, and opinions differ\r\nas to whether his erotic songs are, or are not, platonic. It is another\r\nvariant of the classic cases of Laura and Petrarch, of Catalina de\r\nAtayde and Camões. All good Sevillans contend that Herrera, as the\r\nchief of Spanish _petrarquistas_, indited sonnets to his mistress in\r\nimitation of the master:—\r\n\r\n  \"_So the great Tuscan to the beauteous Laura\r\n  Breathed his sublime, his wonder-working song._\"\r\n\r\nDisguised as Eliodora, Leonor is Herrera's firmament: his _luz_,\r\n_sol_, _estrella_—light, sun, and star. And no small part of the\r\nlove-sequence is passionless and even frigid. Yet not all the elegies\r\nare compact of conceit; a genuine emotion bursts forth elsewhere than\r\nin the famous line:—\r\n\r\n  \"_Now sorrow passes: now at length I live._\"\r\n\r\nIn view of the poet's metaphysical refinements no decisive judgment is\r\npossible, and the dispute will continue for all time; perhaps the real\r\nposture of affairs is indicated by Latour's happy phrase concerning\r\nHerrera's \"innocent immorality.\"\r\n\r\nFine as are isolated passages in these \"vain, amatorious\" rhapsodies,\r\nthe true Herrera is best revealed in his ode to Don Juan de Austria on\r\nthe occasion of the Moorish revolt in the Alpujarra, in his elegy on\r\nthe death of Sebastian of Portugal at Alcázar al-Kebir, in his song\r\nupon the victory of Lepanto. In patriotism Herrera found his noblest\r\ninspiration, and in these three great pieces he attains an exceptional\r\nenergy and conciseness of form. He sings the triumph of the true\r\nfaith with an Hebraic fervour, a stateliness derived from biblical\r\ncadences, as he mourns the overthrow of Christianity, \"the weapons of\r\nwar perished,\" in accents of profound affliction. His sincerity and\r\nhis lyrical splendour place him in the foremost rank of his country's\r\nsingers; and hence his title of _El divino_.\r\n\r\nDiffering in temperament from Garcilaso, Herrera may be considered as\r\nthe true inheritor of his predecessor's unfulfilled renown. Two of\r\nhis finest sonnets—one to Carlos Quinto, the other to Don Juan de\r\nAustria—are superior to any in Garcilaso's page. The latter may be\r\nexampled here in Archdeacon Churton's rendering:—\r\n\r\n  \"_Deep sea, whose thundering waves in tumult roar,\r\n    Call forth thy troubled spirit—bid him rise,\r\n    And gaze, with terror pale, and hollow eyes,\r\n  On floods all flashing fire, and red with gore.\r\n  Lo! as in list enclosed, on battle-floor\r\n    Christian and Sarzan, life and death the prize,\r\n    Join conflict: lo! the batter'd Paynim flies;\r\n  The din, the smouldering flames, he braves no more.\r\n  Go, bid thy deep-toned bass with voice of power\r\n    Tell of this mightiest victory under sky,\r\n    This deed of peerless valour's highest strain;\r\n  And say a youth achieved the glorious hour,\r\n    Hallowing thy gulf with praise that ne'er shall die,—\r\n    The youth of Austria, and the might of Spain._\"\r\n\r\nHerrera takes up the tradition of his forerunner, perfects his form,\r\nimparts a greater sonority of expression, a deeper note of pathos and\r\ndignity. The soldier, with his languid sentiment, might be the priest;\r\nthe priest, with his martial music, might be the soldier. Yet Herrera's\r\nfealty never wavers; for him there is but one model, one pattern, one\r\nperfect singer. \"In our Spain,\" he avers, \"Garcilaso stands first,\r\nbeyond compare.\" And in this spirit, aided by suggestions from the\r\npoet's son-in-law, Puerto Carrero, aided also by illustrations from\r\nthe whole Sevillan group,—Francisco de Medina, Diego Girón, Francisco\r\nPacheco, and Cristóbal Mosquera de Figueroa,—Herrera undertook his\r\ncommentary, _Anotaciones á las obras de Garcilaso de la Vega_ (1580).\r\nIts publication caused one of the bitterest quarrels in Spanish\r\nliterary history.\r\n\r\nFour years earlier Garcilaso had been edited by the learned Francisco\r\nSánchez (1523-1601), commonly called _El Brocense_, from Las Brozas,\r\nhis birthplace, in Extremadura; and an excitable admirer of the poet,\r\nFrancisco de los Cobos, denounced Sánchez for exhibiting his author's\r\ndebts by means of parallel passages. The partisans of Sánchez took\r\nHerrera's commentary as a challenge, and were not mollified by the fact\r\nthat Herrera nowhere mentioned Sánchez by name. It had been bad enough\r\nthat an Extremaduran pundit should edit a Castilian poet; that a mere\r\nAndalucían should repeat the outrage was insufferable. It was as though\r\nan Englishman edited Burns. The Clan of Clonglocketty (or of Castile)\r\nrose as one man, and Herrera was flagellated by a tribe of scurrilous,\r\nilliterate patriots. Among his more urbane opponents was Juan Fernández\r\nde Velasco, Conde de Haro, son of the Constable of Spain, who published\r\nhis _Observaciones_ under the pseudonym of Prete Jacopín, and was\r\nrapturously applauded for calling Herrera an ass in a lion's skin. It\r\nis discouraging to record that Haro's impertinence went through several\r\neditions, while Herrera's commentary has never been reprinted.[9] Yet\r\nthis monument of enlightened learning reveals its author, not only\r\nas the best lyrist, but as the acutest critic of his age. Cervantes\r\nknew it almost by heart, and he honoured it by writing his dedication\r\nof _Don Quixote_ to the Duque de Béjar in the very words of Medina's\r\npreface and of Herrera's epistle to the Marqués de Ayamonte. So that,\r\nsince countless readers have admired a passage from the _Anotaciones_\r\nwithout knowing it, Herrera the prose-writer has enjoyed a vicarious\r\nimmortality.\r\n\r\nThe most eminent poet of the Salamancan school is LUIS PONCE DE LEÓN\r\n(1529-91), a native of Belmonte de Cuenca, who joined the Augustinian\r\norder in his eighteenth year, and became professor of theology at the\r\nUniversity of Salamanca in 1561. He soon found himself in the midst of\r\na theological squabble as to the comparative merits of the Septuagint\r\nand the Hebrew MSS. Rivals spread the legend—fatal in Spain—that\r\nhe was of Jewish descent, and that he conspired with the Hebrew\r\nprofessors, Martínez de Cantalapiedra and Grajal, in interpreting\r\nScripture according to Jewish traditions. His chief opponent was\r\nLeón de Castro, who held the Greek chair. Public discussions were\r\nthe fashion, and debates waxed acrimonious, after the custom of\r\nprofessors at large. On one occasion Luis de León went so far as to\r\nthreaten Castro with the public burning of the latter's treatise\r\non Isaiah. Castro was not the man to flinch, and anticipated his\r\nenemy by denouncing Fray Luis to the Inquisition. The matter would\r\ndoubtless have ended here, had it not been discovered that Fray Luis\r\nhad translated the _Song of Solomon_ into Castilian: a grave offence\r\nin the eyes of the Holy Office, which, rejecting the Lutheran formula\r\nof \"every man his own pope,\" forbade the circulation of Bibles in the\r\nvernacular. In March 1572 Luis de León was arrested, and was kept a\r\nprisoner by the local authorities for four and a half years, during\r\nwhich he was baited with questions calculated to convict him of heresy\r\nand to involve his friend Benito Arias Montano. Notwithstanding the\r\nefforts of Bartolomé Medina and his brother-Dominicans, Fray Luis\r\nwas acquitted on December 7, 1576. Judged by modern standards, he\r\nwas harshly treated; but toleration is a modern birth, begotten by\r\nindifference and fear. In the sixteenth century men believed what they\r\nprofessed, and acted on their beliefs—the Spaniards by imprisoning\r\ntheir own countryman, Luis de León; Calvin by burning Harvey's\r\nforerunner, the Spaniard Miguel Servet. Fray Luis was the last of\r\nmen to whine and whimper: he was judged by the tribunal of his own\r\nchoosing, the tribunal with which he had menaced Castro: and the result\r\nvindicated his choice.[10] _Ex forti dulcedo_. The indomitable nobility\r\nof his character is visible in the first words he uttered on his return\r\nto the chair which Salamanca had kept for him:—\"Gentlemen, as we were\r\nsaying the other day.\" In 1591 he was elected Vicar-General of Castile,\r\nwas chosen Provincial of his order, and was then commanded, against his\r\nwill, to publish all his writings. He died ten days later.\r\n\r\nIn prison Fray Luis wrote his celebrated treatise, the greatest\r\nof Spanish mystic books, _Los Nombres de Cristo_, a series of\r\ndissertations, in Plato's manner, on the symbolic value of such names\r\nof Christ as the Mount, the Shepherd, the Arm of God, the Prince of\r\nPeace, the Bridegroom. Published in 1583, the exposition is cast in\r\nthe form of a dialogue, in which Marcelo, Sabino, and Julián examine\r\nthe theological mysteries implied by the subject. With Fray Luis's\r\ntheology we have no concern; nor with his learning, save in so far as\r\nit is curious to see the Hellenic-Alexandrine leaven working through\r\nin his imitation of St. Clement's _Epistle to the Corinthians_. But\r\nhis concise eloquence and his classic purity of expression rank him\r\namong the best masters of Castilian prose. The like great qualities\r\nare shown in his _Exposición del libro de Job_, drawn up by request of\r\nSanta Teresa's friend, Sor Ana de Jesús, and in his rendering of and\r\ncommentary on the _Song of Solomon_, which he holds for an emblematic\r\neclogue to be interpreted as a poetic foreshadowing of the Divine\r\nEspousal of the Church with Christ. A book still held in great esteem\r\nis his _Perfecta Casada_ (The Perfect Wife), suggested, it may be, by\r\nLuis Vives' _Christian Woman_, and composed (1583) for the benefit of\r\nMaría Varela Osorio. It is not, indeed,\r\n\r\n  \"_That hymn for which the whole world longs,\r\n    A worthy hymn in woman's praise._\"\r\n\r\nIt is rather a singularly brilliant paraphrase of the thirty-first\r\nchapter of the _Book of Proverbs_, a code of practical conduct for the\r\nideal spouse, which may be read with delight even by those who think\r\nthe friar's doctrine reactionary.\r\n\r\nGreat in prose, Luis de León is no less great in verse. With San Juan\r\nde la Cruz he heads the list of Spain's lyrico-mystical poets. Yet he\r\nset no value on his poems, which he regarded as mere toys of childhood:\r\nso that their preservation is due to the accident of his collecting\r\nthem late in life to amuse the leisure of the Bishop of Córdoba.\r\nWe owe their publication to Quevedo, who issued them in 1631 as a\r\ncounterblast to _culteranismo_. Of the three books into which they are\r\ndivided, two consist of translations—from Virgil, Horace, Tibullus,\r\nEuripides, and Pindar; and from the Psalms, the Book of Job, and St.\r\nThomas of Aquin's _Pange lingua_. \"I have tried,\" says Fray Luis of his\r\nsacred renderings, \"to imitate so far as I might their simple origin\r\nand antique flavour, full of sweetness and majesty, as it seems to me;\"\r\nand he succeeds as greatly in the primitive unction of the one kind\r\nas in the faultless form of the other. Still these are but inspired\r\nimitations, and the original poet is to be sought for in the first\r\nbook. Some idea of his ode entitled _Noche Serena_ may be gathered from\r\nMr. Henry Phillips' version of the opening stanzas:—\r\n\r\n  \"_When to the heavenly dome my thoughts take flight,\r\n  With shimmering stars bedecked, ablaze with light,\r\n      Then sink my eyes down to the ground,\r\n      In slumber wrapped, oblivion bound,\r\n  Enveloped in the gloom of darkest night._\r\n\r\n  _With love and pain assailed, with anxious care,\r\n  A thousand troubles in my breast appear,\r\n      My eyes turn to a flowing rill,\r\n      Sore sorrow's tearful floods distil,\r\n  While saddened, mournful words my woes declare._\r\n\r\n  _Oh, dwelling fit for angels! sacred fane!\r\n  The hallowed shrine where youth and beauty reign!\r\n      Why in this dungeon, plunged in night,\r\n      The soul that's born for Heaven's delight\r\n  Should cruel Fate withhold from its domain?_\"\r\n\r\nIn his _Profecía del Tajo_ (Prophecy of the Tagus) Luis de León\r\ndisplays a virility absent from his other pieces, and the impetuosity\r\nof the verse matches the speed which he attributes to the Saracenic\r\ninvaders advancing to the overthrow of Roderic; and, if he still\r\nabide by his Horatian model, he introduces an individual treatment,\r\na characteristic melody of his own invention. A famous devout song,\r\n_Á Cristo Crucifijado_ (To Christ Crucified), appears in all editions\r\nof Fray Luis; but as its authenticity is disputed—some ascribing it\r\nto Miguel Sánchez—its quotation must be foregone here. The ode _Al\r\nApartamiento_ (To Retirement) exhibits the contemplative vein which\r\ndistinguishes the singer, and, as in the _Ode to Salinas_, seems an\r\nearly anticipation of Wordsworth's note of serene simplicity. Luis\r\nde León is not splendid in metrical resource, and his adherence to\r\ntradition, his indifference to his fame, his ecclesiastical estate, all\r\ntend to narrow his range of subject; yet, within the limits marked out\r\nfor him, he is as great an artist and as rich a voice as Spain can show.\r\n\r\nIn the same year (1631) that Quevedo issued Luis de León's verses, he\r\nalso published an exceedingly small volume of poems which he ascribed\r\nto a Bachelor named FRANCISCO DE LA TORRE (1534-?1594). From this arose\r\na strange case of mistaken identity. Quevedo's own account of the\r\nmatter is simple: he alleges that he found the poems—\"by good luck and\r\nfor the greater glory of Spain\"—in the shop of a bookseller, who sold\r\nthem cheap. It appears that the Portuguese, Juan de Almeida, Senhor de\r\nCouto de Avintes, saw them soon after Torre's death, that he applied\r\nfor leave to print them, and that the official licence was signed by\r\nthe author of _La Araucana_, Ercilla y Zúñiga, who died in 1595. For\r\nsome reason Almeida's purpose miscarried, and, when Quevedo found the\r\nmanuscript in 1629, Torre was generally forgotten. Quevedo solved\r\nthe difficulty out of hand in the high editorial manner, evolved the\r\nfacts from his inner consciousness, and assured his readers that the\r\nauthor of the poems was the Francisco de la Torre who wrote the _Visión\r\ndeleitable_.[11]\r\n\r\nTicknor lays it down that \"no suspicion seems to have been whispered,\r\neither at the moment of their first publication, or for a long time\r\nafterwards,\" of the correctness of this attribution; and he implies\r\nthat the first doubter was Luis José Velázquez, Marqués de Valdeflores,\r\nwho, when he reprinted the book in 1753, started the theory that the\r\npoems were Quevedo's own. This is not so. Quevedo's mistake was pointed\r\nout by Manuel de Faria y Sousa in his commentary to the _Lusiadas_,\r\nprinted at Madrid in 1639. That Quevedo should make a Bachelor of a\r\nman who had no university degree, that he should call the writer of\r\nthe _Visión deleitable_ Francisco when in truth his name was Alfonso,\r\nwere trifles: that he should antedate his author by nearly two\r\ncenturies—this was a serious matter, and Faria y Sousa took pains to\r\nmake him realise it. It must have added to the editor's chagrin to\r\nlearn that Torre had been friendly with Lope de Vega, who could have\r\ngiven accurate information about him; but Lope and Quevedo were not on\r\nspeaking terms, owing to the mischief-making of the former's parasite,\r\nPérez de Montalbán. Quevedo had made no approach to Lope; Lope saw the\r\nblunder, smiled, and said nothing in public. Through Pérez de Montalbán\r\nthe facts reached Faria y Sousa, who exulted over a mistake which was,\r\nindeed, unpardonable. The discomfiture was complete: for the first and\r\nlast time in his life Quevedo was dumb before an enemy. Meanwhile,\r\nVelázquez' theory has found some favour with López Sedano and with many\r\nforeign critics: as, for example, Ticknor.\r\n\r\nWhat we know of Francisco de la Torre is based upon the researches of\r\nQuevedo's learned editor, Aureliano Fernández-Guerra y Orbe.[12] A\r\nnative of Torrelaguna, he matriculated at Alcalá de Henares in 1556,\r\nfell in love with the \"_Filis rigurosa_\" whom he sings, served with\r\nCarlos Quinto in the Italian campaigns, returned to find Filis married\r\nto an elderly Toledan millionaire, remained constant to his (more\r\nor less) platonic flame, and ended by taking orders in his despair.\r\nThe unadorned simplicity of his manner is at the remotest pole from\r\nQuevedo's frosty brilliancy. No small proportion of his sonnets is\r\ntranslated from the Italian. Thus, where Benedetto Varchi writes\r\n\"_Questa e, Tirsi, quel fonte in cui solea_,\" Torre follows close with\r\n\"_Ésta es, Tirsi, la fuente do solia_;\" and when Giovanni Battista\r\nAmalteo celebrates \"_La viva neve e le vermiglie rose_,\" the Spaniard\r\nechoes back \"_La blanca nieve y la purpúrea rosa_.\" Schelling finds\r\nthe light fantastic rapture of the Elizabethan lover expressed to\r\nperfection in the eighty-first of Spenser's _Amoretti_: line for line,\r\nand almost word for word, Torre's twenty-third sonnet is identical,\r\nand, when we at length possess a critical edition of Spenser, it will\r\nsurely prove that both poems derive from a common Italian source.\r\nSuch examples are numerous, and are worth noting as germane to the\r\ngeneral question. No man in Europe was more original than Quevedo,\r\nnone less disposed to lean on Italy. To conceive that he should seek\r\nto reform _culteranismo_ by translating from Italians of yesterday, or\r\nto suppose that he knowingly passed as original work imitations made\r\nby a man who—_ex hypothesi_—died before his models were born, is to\r\nbelieve Quevedo a clumsy trickster. That conclusion is untenable; and\r\nTorre deserves all credit for his graceful renderings, as for his more\r\noriginal poems—gallant, tender, and sentimental. He is one of the\r\nearliest Spanish poets to choose simple, natural themes—the ivy fallen\r\nto the ground, the widowed song-bird, the wounded hind, the charms\r\nof landscape and the enchantment of the spring. A smaller replica of\r\nGarcilaso, with a vision and personality of his own: so Francisco de la\r\nTorre appears in the perspective of Castilian song.\r\n\r\nAn allied poet of the Salamancan school is Torre's friend, FRANCISCO DE\r\nFIGUEROA (1536-?1620), a native of Alcalá de Henares, whom his townsman\r\nCervantes introduces in the pastoral _Galatea_ under the name of Tirsi.\r\nLittle is recorded of his life save that he served as a soldier in\r\nItaly, that he studied at Rome, Bologna, Siena, and perhaps Naples,\r\nthat the Italians called him the _Divino_ (the title was sometimes\r\ncheaply given), and that some even ranked him next to Petrarch. He\r\nreturned to Alcalá, where he married \"nobly,\" as we are told; and he is\r\nfound travelling with the Duque de Terranova in the Low Countries about\r\n1597. On his deathbed he bethought him of Virgil's example, and ordered\r\nthat all his poems should be burned; those that escaped were published\r\nat Lisbon in 1626 by the historian Luis Tribaldos de Toledo, who\r\nreports what little we know concerning the writer. That he versified\r\nmuch in Italian appears from Juan Verzosa's evidence:—\r\n\r\n  \"_El lingua perges alterna pangere versus._\"\r\n\r\nAnd a vestige of the youthful practice is preserved in the elegy to\r\nJuan de Mendoza y Luna, where one Spanish line and two Italian lines\r\ncompose each tercet. One admirable sonnet is that written on the death\r\nof the poet's son, Garcilaso de la Vega _el Mozo_, who, like his famous\r\nfather, fell in battle. Figueroa's bent is towards the pastoral; he\r\nsings of sweet repose, of love's costly glory, of Tirsi's pangs,\r\nof Fileno's passion realised, and of _ingrata_ Fili. His points of\r\nresemblance with Torre are many; but his talent is more original, his\r\nmood more melancholy, his taste finer, his diction more exquisite. He\r\nranks so high among his country's singers, it is not incredible that\r\nhe might take his stand with the greatest if we possessed all his\r\npoems, instead of a few numbers saved from fire. And, as it is, he\r\ndeserves peculiar praise as the earliest poet who, following Boscán\r\nand Garcilaso, mastered the blank verse, whose secrets had eluded\r\nthem. He avoids the subtle peril of the assonant; he varies the\r\nmechanical uniformity of beat or stress; and, by skilful alternations\r\nof his cæsura, diversifies his rhythm to such harmonic purpose as no\r\nearlier experimentalist approaches. At his hands the most formidable\r\nof Castilian metres is finally vanquished, and the _verso suelto_\r\nis established on an equality with the sonnet. That alone ensures\r\nFigueroa's fame: he sets the standard by which successors are measured.\r\n\r\nAriosto's vigorous epical manner is faintly suggested in twelve cantos\r\nof the _Angélica_, by a Seville doctor, LUIS BARAHONA DE SOTO (fl.\r\n1586). Lope de Vega, in the _Laurel de Apolo_, praises\r\n\r\n  \"_The doctor admirable\r\n  Whose page of gold\r\n  The story of Medora told_,\"\r\n\r\nand all contemporaries, from Diego Hurtado de Mendoza downwards,\r\nswell the chorus of applause. The priest who sacked Don Quixote's\r\nlibrary softened at sight of Barahona's book, which he calls by its\r\npopular title, the _Lágrimas de Angélica_ (Tears of Angelica):—\"I\r\nshould shed tears myself were such a book burned, for its author is\r\none of the best poets, not merely in Spain, but in all the world.\"\r\nCervantes was far from strong in criticism, and he proves it in this\r\ncase. The _Angélica_, which purports to continue the story of _Orlando\r\nFurioso_—itself a continuation of the _Orlando Innamorato_—looks\r\nmean beside its great original. Yet, though Barahona fails in epic\r\nnarrative, his lyrical poems, given in Espinosa's _Flores de poetas\r\nilustres_, are full of grace and melody.\r\n\r\nThe epic's fascination also seduced the Córdoban, JUAN RUFO GUTIÉRREZ.\r\nWe know the date of neither his birth nor his death, but he must have\r\nlived long if his collection of anecdotes, entitled _Las seiscientas\r\nApotegmas_, were really published in 1548. His _Austriada_, printed in\r\n1584, takes Don Juan de Austria for its hero, and contains some good\r\ndescriptive stanzas; but Rufo's invention finds no scope in dealing\r\nwith contemporary matters, and what might have been a useful chronicle\r\nis distorted to a tedious poem. Great part of the _Austriada_ is but a\r\nrhymed version of Mendoza's _Guerra de Granada_, which Rufo must have\r\nseen in manuscript. When, leaving Ariosto in peace, he becomes himself,\r\nas in the verses at the end of the _Apotegmas_, he gives forth a\r\nnatural old-world note, reminiscent of earlier models than Boscán and\r\nGarcilaso. Since Luis de Zapata (1523-? 1600) wrote an epic history\r\nof the Emperor, the _Carlos famoso_, he must have read it; and it is\r\npossible that Cervantes (who delighted in it) was familiar with its\r\nfifty cantos, its forty thousand lines. It is more than can be said\r\nof any later reader. Zapata wasted thirteen years upon his epic, and\r\nwitnessed its failure; but he was undismayed, and lived to maltreat\r\nHorace—it sounds incredible—beyond all expectation. It is another\r\ninstance of a mistaken calling. The writer knew his facts, and had a\r\ntouch of the historic spirit. Yet he could not be content with prose\r\nand history.\r\n\r\nA nearer approach to the right epical poem is the _Araucana_ of ALONSO\r\nDE ERCILLA Y ZÚÑIGA (1533-95), who appeared as Felipe II.'s page at his\r\nwedding with Mary Tudor in Winchester Cathedral. From England he sailed\r\nfor Chile in 1554, to serve against the Araucanos, who had risen in\r\nrevolt; and in seven pitched battles, not to speak of innumerable small\r\nengagements, he greatly distinguished himself. His career was ruined by\r\na quarrel with a brother-officer named Juan de Pineda; he was judged to\r\nbe in fault, was condemned to death, and actually mounted the scaffold.\r\nAt the last moment the sentence was commuted to exile at Callao, whence\r\nErcilla returned to Europe in 1562. With him he brought the first\r\nfifteen cantos of his poem, written by the camp-fire on stray scraps\r\nof paper, leather, and skin. The first book ever printed in America\r\nwas, as we learn from Señor Icazbalceta, Juan de Zumárraga's _Breve\r\ny compendiosa Doctrina Cristiana_. The first literary work of real\r\nmerit composed in either American continent was Ercilla's _Araucana_.\r\nIt was published at Madrid in 1569; and continuations, amounting to\r\nthirty-seven cantos in all, followed in 1578 and 1590. Ercilla never\r\nforgave what he thought the injustice of his general, García Hurtado de\r\nMendoza, Marqués de Cañete, and carefully omits his name throughout the\r\n_Araucana_. The omission cost him dear, for he was never employed again.\r\n\r\nHis is an exceeding stately poem on the Chilian revolt; but epic it\r\nis not, whether in spirit or design, whether in form or effect. In\r\nthe Essay Prefatory to the _Henriade_, Voltaire condescends to praise\r\nthe _Araucana_, the name of which has thus become familiar to many;\r\nand, though he was probably writing at second hand, he is justified\r\nin extolling the really noble speech which Ercilla gives to the aged\r\nchief, Colocolo. It is precisely in declamatory eloquence that Ercilla\r\nshines. His technical craftsmanship is sound, his spirit admirable,\r\nhis diction beyond reproach, or nearly so; and yet his work, as a\r\nwhole, fails to impress. Men remember isolated lines, a stanza here\r\nand there; but the general effect is blurred. To speak truly, Ercilla\r\nhad the orator's temperament, not the poet's. At his worst he is\r\ndebating in rhyme, at his best he is writing poetic history; and,\r\nthough he has an eye for situation, an instinct for the picturesque,\r\nthe historian in him vanquishes the poet. He himself was vaguely\r\nconscious of something lacking, and he strove to make it good by means\r\nof mythological episodes, visions by Bellona, magic foreshadowings of\r\nvictory, digressions defending Dido from Virgil's scandalous tattle.\r\nBut, since the secret of the epic lies not in machinery, this attempt\r\nat reform failed. Ercilla's first part remains his best, and is still\r\ninteresting for its martial eloquence, and valuable as a picture\r\nof heroic barbarism rendered by an artist in _ottava rima_ who was\r\nalso a vigilant observer and a magnanimous foe. His omission of his\r\ncommander's name was made good by a copious Chilian poet, Pedro de\r\nOña, in his _Arauco domado_ (1596), which closed with the capture of\r\n\"Richerte Aquines\" (as who should say Richard Hawkins); and, in the\r\nfollowing year, Diego de Santisteban y Osorio added a fourth and fifth\r\npart to the original _Araucana_. Neither imitation is of real poetic\r\nworth, and, as versified history, they are inferior to the _Elegías\r\nde Varones ilustres de Indias_ of Juan de Castellanos (?1510-?1590),\r\na priest who in youth had served in America, and who rhymed his\r\nreminiscences with a conscientious regard for fact more laudable in a\r\nchronicler than a poet.\r\n\r\nBut we turn from these elaborate historical failures to religious work\r\nof real beauty, and the first that offers itself is the famous sonnet\r\n\"To Christ Crucified,\" familiar to English readers in a free version\r\nascribed to Dryden:—\r\n\r\n  \"_O God, Thou art the object of my love,\r\n  Not for the hopes of endless joys above,\r\n  Nor for the fear of endless pains below\r\n  Which those who love Thee not must undergo:\r\n  For me, and such as me, Thou once didst bear\r\n  The ignominious cross, the nails, the spear,\r\n  A thorny crown transpierced Thy sacred brow,\r\n  What bloody sweats from every member flow!\r\n  For me, in torture Thou resign'st Thy breath,\r\n  Nailed to the cross, and sav'dst me by Thy death:\r\n  Say, can these sufferings fail my heart to move?\r\n  What but Thyself can now deserve my love?\r\n  Such as then was and is Thy love to me,\r\n  Such is, and shall be still, my love to Thee.\r\n  Thy love, O Jesus, may I ever sing,\r\n  O God of love, kind Parent, dearest King._\"\r\n\r\nThe authorship is referred to Ignacio Loyola, to Francisco Xavier, to\r\nPedro de los Reyes, and to the Seraphic Mother, SANTA TERESA DE JESÚS,\r\nwhose name in the world was Teresa de Cepeda y Ahumada (1515-82). None\r\nof these attributions can be sustained, and _No me mueve, mi Dios,\r\npara quererte_ must be classed as anonymous.[13] Yet its fervour and\r\nunction are such as to suggest its ascription to the Saint of the\r\nFlaming Heart. Santa Teresa is not only a glorious saint and a splendid\r\nfigure in the annals of religious thought: she ranks as a miracle of\r\ngenius, as, perhaps, the greatest woman who ever handled pen, the\r\nsingle one of all her sex who stands beside the world's most perfect\r\nmasters. Macaulay has noted, in a famous essay, that Protestantism has\r\ngained not an inch of ground since the middle of the sixteenth century.\r\nIgnacio Loyola and Santa Teresa are the life and brain of the Catholic\r\nreaction: the former is a great party chief, the latter belongs to\r\nmankind.\r\n\r\nHer life in all its details may be read in Mrs. Cunninghame Graham's\r\nminute and able study. Here it must suffice to note that she sallied\r\nforth to seek martyrdom at the age of seven, that she entered\r\nliterature as the writer of a chivalresque romance, and that in her\r\nsixteenth year she made her profession as a nun in the Carmelite\r\nconvent of her native town, Ávila. Years of spiritual aridity, of\r\nill-health, weighed her down, aged her prematurely. But nothing\r\ncould abate her natural force; and from 1558 to the day of her\r\ndeath she marches from one victory to another, careless of pain,\r\nmisunderstanding, misery, and persecution, a wonder of valour and\r\ndevotion.\r\n\r\n  \"_Scarce has she blood enough to make\r\n  A guilty sword blush for her sake;\r\n  Yet has a heart dares hope to prove\r\n  How much less strong is Death than Love....\r\n  Love touch't her heart, and lo! it beats\r\n  High, and burns with such brave heats,\r\n  Such thirst to die, as dares drink up\r\n  A thousand cold deaths in one cup._\"\r\n\r\nWhat Crashaw has here said of her in verse he repeats in prose,\r\nand the heading of his poem may be quoted as a concise summary of\r\nher achievement:—\"Foundress of the Reformation of the Discalced\r\nCarmelites, both men and women; a woman for angelical height of\r\nspeculation, for masculine courage of performance more than a woman;\r\nwho, yet a child, outran maturity, and durst plot a martyrdom.\" And all\r\nthe world has read with ever-growing admiration the burning words of\r\nCrashaw's \"sweet incendiary,\" the \"undaunted daughter of desires,\" the\r\n\"fair sister of the seraphim,\" \"the moon of maiden stars.\"\r\n\r\nSimplicity and conciseness are Santa Teresa's distinctive qualities,\r\nand the marvel is where she acquired her perfect style. Not, we may\r\nbe sure, in the numerous prose of _Amadís_. Her confessor, the worthy\r\nGracián, took it upon him to \"improve\" and polish her periods; but,\r\nin a fortunate hour, her papers came into the hands of Luis de León,\r\nwho gave them to the press in 1588. Himself a master in mysticism and\r\nliterature, he perceived the truth embodied later in Crashaw's famous\r\nline:—\r\n\r\n  \"_O 'tis not Spanish but 'tis Heaven she speaks._\"\r\n\r\nHer masterpiece is the _Castillo interior_, of which Fray Luis\r\nwrites:—\"Let naught be blotted out, save when she herself emended:\r\nwhich was seldom.\" And once more he commends her to her readers,\r\nsaying:—\"She, who had seen God face to face, now reveals Him unto\r\nyou.\" With all her sublimity, her enraptured vision of things heavenly,\r\nher \"large draughts of intellectual day,\" Santa Teresa illustrates\r\nthe combination of the loftiest mysticism with the finest practical\r\nsense, and her style varies, takes ever its colour from its subject.\r\nFamiliar and maternal in her letters, enraptured in her _Conceptos del\r\nAmor de Dios_, she handles with equal skill the trifles of our petty\r\nlives and—to use Luis de León's phrase—\"the highest and most generous\r\nphilosophy that was ever dreamed.\" And from her briefest sentence\r\nshines the vigorous soul of one born to govern, one who governed\r\nin such wise that a helpless Nuncio denounced her as \"restless,\r\ndisobedient, contumacious, an inventress of new doctrines tricked out\r\nwith piety, a breaker of the cloister-rule, a despiser of the apostolic\r\nprecept which forbiddeth a woman to teach.\"\r\n\r\nSanta Teresa taught because she must, and all that she wrote was\r\nwritten by compulsion, under orders from her superior. She could\r\nnever have understood the female novelist's desire for publicity;\r\nand, had she realised it, merry as her humour was, she would\r\nscarcely have smiled. For she was, both by descent and temperament,\r\na gentlewoman—_de sangre muy limpia_, as she writes more than once,\r\nwith a tinge of satisfaction which shows that the convent discipline\r\nhad not stifled her pride of race any more than it had quenched her\r\ngaiety. She always remembers that she comes from Castile, and the fact\r\nis evidenced in her writings, with their delicious old-world savour.\r\nBoscán and Garcilaso might influence courtiers and learned poets; but\r\nthey were impotent against the brave Castilian of Sor Teresa de Jesús,\r\nwho wields her instrument with incomparable mastery. It were a sin to\r\nattempt a rendering of her artless songs, with their resplendent gleams\r\nof ecstasy and passion. But some idea of her general manner, when\r\nuntouched by the inspiration of her mystic nuptials, may be gathered\r\nfrom a passage which Froude has Englished:—\r\n\r\n\"A man is directed to make a garden in a bad soil overrun with sour\r\ngrasses. The Lord of the land roots out the weeds, sows seeds, and\r\nplants herbs and fruit-trees. The gardener must then care for them\r\nand water them, that they may thrive and blossom, and that the Lord\r\nmay find pleasure in his garden and come to visit it. There are four\r\nways in which the watering may be done. There is water which is drawn\r\nwearily by hand from the well. There is water drawn by the ox-wheel,\r\nmore abundantly and with greater labour. There is water brought in\r\nfrom the river, which will saturate the whole ground; and, last and\r\nbest, there is rain from heaven. Four sorts of prayer correspond to\r\nthese. The first is a weary effort with small returns; the well may run\r\ndry: the gardener then must weep. The second is internal prayer and\r\nmeditation upon God; the trees will then show leaves and flower-buds.\r\nThe third is love of God. The virtues then become vigorous. We converse\r\nwith God face to face. The flowers open and give out fragrance. The\r\nfourth kind cannot be described in words. Then there is no more toil,\r\nand the seasons no longer change; flowers are always blowing, and\r\nfruit ripens perennially. The soul enjoys undoubting certitude; the\r\nfaculties work without effort and without consciousness; the heart\r\nloves and does not know that it loves; the mind perceives, yet does\r\nnot know that it perceives. If the butterfly pauses to say to itself\r\nhow prettily it is flying, the shining wings fall off, and it drops\r\nand dies. The life of the spirit is not our life, but the life of God\r\nwithin us.\"\r\n\r\nAnd, as Santa Teresa excelled in spiritual insight, so she has the\r\nsense of affairs. Durtal, in M. Joris-Karl Huysmans' _En Route_, first\r\nsays of her:—\"Sainte Térèse a exploré plus à fond que tout autre\r\nles régions inconnues de l'âme; elle en est, en quelque sorte, la\r\ngéographe; elle a surtout dressé la carte de ses pôles, marqué les\r\nlatitudes contemplatives, les terres intérieures du ciel humain.\"\r\nAnd he shows the reverse of the medal:—\"Mais quel singulier mélange\r\nelle montre aussi, d'une mystique ardente et d'une femme d'affaires\r\nfroide; car, enfin, elle est à double fond; elle est contemplative hors\r\nle monde et elle est également un homme d'état: elle est le Colbert\r\nféminin des cloîtres.\" The key to Durtal's difficulties is given in\r\nthe Abbé Gévresin's remark, that the perfect balance of good sense is\r\none of the distinctive signs of the mystics. In Santa Teresa's case\r\nthe sign is present. An uninquiring world may choose to think of her\r\nas a fanatic in vapours and in ecstasies. Yet it is she who writes,\r\nin the _Camino de Perfección_:—\"I would not have my daughters be, or\r\nseem to be, women in anything, but brave men.\" It is she who holds\r\nthat \"of revelations no account should be made\"; who calls the usual\r\nconvent life \"a shortcut to hell\"; who adds that \"if parents took my\r\nadvice, they would rather marry their daughters to the poorest of\r\nmen, or keep them at home under their own eyes.\" Her position as a\r\nspiritual force is as unique as her place in literature. It is certain\r\nthat her \"own dear books\" were nothing to her; that she regarded\r\nliterature as frivolity; and no one questions her right so to regard\r\nit. But the world also is entitled to its judgment, which is expressed\r\nin different ways. Jeremy Taylor cites her in a sermon preached at the\r\nopening of the Parliament of Ireland (May 8, 1661). Protestant England,\r\nby the mouth of Froude, compares Santa Teresa to Cervantes. Catholic\r\nSpain places her manuscript of her own _Life_ beside a page of St.\r\nAugustine's writing in the Palace of the Escorial.\r\n\r\nIn some sense we may almost consider the Ecstatic Doctor, SAN JUAN DE\r\nLA CRUZ (1542-91), as one of Santa Teresa's disciples. He changed his\r\nworldly name of Juan de Yepes y Álvarez for that of Juan de la Cruz\r\non joining the Carmelite order in 1563. Shortly afterwards he made\r\nthe acquaintance of Santa Teresa, and, fired by her enthusiasm, he\r\nundertook to carry out in monasteries the reforms which she introduced\r\nin convents. In his _Obras espirituales_ (1618) mysticism finds its\r\nhighest expression. There are moments when his prose style is of\r\nextreme clearness and force, but in many cases he soars to heights\r\nwhere the sense reels in the attempt to follow him. St. John of the\r\nCross holds, with the mystics of all time, with Plotinus and Böhme and\r\nSwedenborg, that \"by contemplation man may become incorporated with the\r\nDeity.\" This is a hard saying for some of us, not least to the present\r\nwriter, and it were idle, in the circumstances, to attempt criticism of\r\nwhat for most men must remain a mystery. Yet in his verse one seizes\r\nthe sense more easily; and his high, amorous music has an individual\r\nmelody of spiritual ravishment, of daring abandonment, which is not\r\nall lost in Mr. David Lewis' unrhymed version of the _Noche oscura del\r\nAlma_ (Dark Night of the Soul):—\r\n\r\n  \"_In an obscure night,\r\n  With anxious love inflamed,\r\n  O happy lot!\r\n  Forth unobserved I went,\r\n  My house being now at rest...._\r\n\r\n  _In that happy night,\r\n  In secret, seen of none,\r\n  Seeing nought but myself,\r\n  Without other light or guide\r\n  Save that which in my heart was burning._\r\n\r\n  _That light guided me\r\n  More surely than the noonday sun\r\n  To the place where he was waiting for me\r\n  Whom I knew well,\r\n  And none but he appeared._\r\n\r\n  _O guiding night!\r\n  O night more lovely than the dawn!\r\n  O night that hast united\r\n  The lover with his beloved\r\n  And charged her with her love._\r\n\r\n  _On my flowery bosom,\r\n  Kept whole for him alone,\r\n  He reposed and slept:\r\n  I kept him, and the waving\r\n  Of the cedars fanned him._\r\n\r\n  _Then his hair floated in the breeze\r\n  That blew from the turret;\r\n  He struck me on the neck\r\n  With his gentle hand,\r\n  And all sensation left me._\r\n\r\n  _I continued in oblivion lost,\r\n  My head was resting on my love;\r\n  I fainted at last abandoned,\r\n  And, amid the lilies forgotten,\r\n  Threw all my cares away._\"\r\n\r\nSt. John of the Cross has absorbed the mystic essence of the _Song of\r\nSolomon_, and he introduces infinite new harmonies in his re-setting of\r\nthe ancient melody. The worst that criticism can allege against him is\r\nthat he dwells on the very frontier line of sense, in a twilight where\r\nmusic takes the place of meaning, and words are but vague symbols of\r\ninexpressible thoughts, intolerable raptures, too subtly sensuous for\r\ntranscription. The _Unknown Eros_, a volume of odes, mainly mystical\r\nand Catholic, by Coventry Patmore, which has had so considerable an\r\ninfluence on recent English writers, was a deliberate attempt to\r\ntransfer to our poetry the methods of St. John of the Cross, whose\r\ninfluence grows ever deeper with time.\r\n\r\nThe Dominican monk whose family name was Sarriá, but who is only known\r\nfrom his birthplace as LUIS DE GRANADA (1504-88), is usually accounted\r\na mystic writer, though he is vastly less contemplative, more didactic\r\nand practical, than San Juan de la Cruz. He is best known by his _Guía\r\nde Pecadores_, which Regnier made the favourite reading of Macette, and\r\nwhich Gorgibus recommends to Célie in _Sganarelle_:—\r\n\r\n  \"_La Guide des pécheurs est encore un bon livre:\r\n  C'est là qu'en peu de temps on apprend à bien vivre._\"\r\n\r\nUnluckily for Granada, his _Guía de Pecadores_ and his _Tratado de\r\nla Oración y Meditación_ were placed on the Index, chiefly at the\r\ninstigation of that hammer of heretics, Melchor Cano, the famous\r\ntheologian of the Council of Trent. Certain changes were made in the\r\ntext, and the books were reprinted in their amended form; but the\r\nsuspicion of _iluminismo_ long hung over Granada, whose last years were\r\ntroubled by his rash simplicity in certifying as true the sham stigmata\r\nof a Portuguese nun, Sor María de la Visitación. The story that Granada\r\nwas persecuted by the Inquisition is imaginary.\r\n\r\nHis books have still an immense vogue. His sincerity, learning, and\r\nfervour are admirable, and his forty years spent between confessional\r\nand pulpit gave him a rare knowledge of human weakness and a mastery\r\nof eloquent appeal. He is not declamatory in the worst sense, though\r\nhe bears the marks of his training. He sins by abuse of oratorical\r\nantithesis, by repetition, by a certain mechanical see-saw of the\r\nsentence common to those who harangue multitudes. Still, the sweetness\r\nof his nature so flows over in his words that didacticism becomes\r\npersuasive even when he argues against our strongest prepossessions.\r\nIt may interest to quote a passage from the translation made by that\r\nFrancis Meres whose _Palladis Tamia_ contains the earliest reference to\r\nShakespeare's \"sugared sonnets\":—\r\n\r\n\"This desire which doth hold many so resolutely to their studies, and\r\nthis love of science and knowledge under pretence to help others,\r\nis too much and superfluous. I call it a love too much and desire\r\nsuperfluous; for when it is moderate and according to reason, it is\r\nnot a temptation, but a laudable virtue and a very profitable exercise\r\nwhich is commended in all kind of men, but especially in young men who\r\ndo exercise their youth in that study, for by it they eschew many vices\r\nand learn that whereby they will counsel themselves and others. But\r\nunless it be moderately used it hurteth devotion.... There be some that\r\nwould know for this end only, that they might know—and it is foolish\r\ncuriosity. There be some that would know, that they might be known—and\r\nit is foolish vanity; and there be some that would know, that they\r\nmight sell their knowledge for money or for honours—and it is filthy\r\nlucre. There be also some that desire to know, that they may edify—and\r\nit is charity. And there are some that would know, that they may be\r\nedified—and it is wisdom. All these ends may move the desire, and, in\r\nchoice of these, a man is often deceived, when he considereth not which\r\nought especially to move; and this error is very dangerous.\"\r\n\r\nThis distrust of profane letters is yet more marked in the Augustinian,\r\nPEDRO MALÓN DE CHAIDE of Cascante (1530-?1590), who compares the\r\n\"frivolous love-books\" of Boscán, Garcilaso, and Montemôr and the\r\n\"fabulous tales and lies\" of chivalresque romance to a knife in\r\na madman's hand. His practice clashes with his theory, for his\r\n_Conversión de la Magdalena_, written for Beatriz Cerdán, is learned to\r\nthe verge of pedantry, and his elaborate periods betray the imitation\r\nof models which he professed to abhor. More ascetic than mystic,\r\nMalón de Chaide lacks the patrician ease, the tolerant spirit of Juan\r\nde Ávila, Granada, and León; but his austere doctrine and sumptuous\r\ncolouring have ensured him permanent popularity. His admirable verse\r\nparaphrases of the _Song of Solomon_ have much of the unction, without\r\nthe sensuous exaltation, of Juan de la Cruz. A better representative of\r\npure mysticism is the Extremaduran Carmelite, JUAN DE LOS ÁNGELES (fl.\r\n1595), whose _Triumphos del Amor de Dios_ is a profound psychological\r\nstudy, written under the influence of Northern thinkers, and not less\r\nremarkable for beauty of expression than for impassioned insight. With\r\nhim our notice of the Spanish mystics must close. It is difficult\r\nto estimate their number exactly; but since at least three thousand\r\nsurvive in print, it is not surprising that the most remain unread. A\r\nbreath of mysticism is met in the few Castilian verses of the brilliant\r\nhumanist, BENITO ARIAS MONTANO (1527-98), who gave up to scholarship\r\nand theology what was meant for poetry. His achievement in the two\r\nformer fields is not our concern here, but it pleases to denote the\r\nample inspiration and the lofty simplicity of his song, which is hidden\r\nfrom many readers, and overlooked even by literary historians, in Böhl\r\nde Faber's _Floresta de rimas antiguas_.\r\n\r\n                   *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe pastoral novel, like the chivalresque romance, reaches Spain\r\nthrough Portugal. The Italianised Spaniard, Jacopo Sannazaro, had\r\ninvented the first example of this kind in his epoch-making _Arcadia_\r\n(1504); and his earliest follower was the Portuguese, Bernardim Ribeiro\r\n(?1475-?1524), whose _Menina e moça_ transplants the prose pastoral\r\nto the Peninsula. This remarkable book, which derives its title from\r\nthe first three words of the text, is the undoubted model of the first\r\nCastilian prose pastoral, the unfinished _Diana Enamorada_. This we\r\nowe to the Portuguese, JORGE DE MONTEMÔR (d. 1561), whose name is\r\nhispaniolised as Montemayor. There is nothing strange in this usage\r\nof Castilian by a Portuguese writer. We have already recorded the\r\nnames of Gil Vicente, Sâ de Miranda, and Silvestre among those of\r\nCastilian poets; the lyrics and comedies of Camões, the _Austriada_ of\r\nJerónimo Corte Real, continue a tradition which begins as early as the\r\n_General Cancioneiro_ of García de Resende (1516), wherein twenty-nine\r\nPortuguese poets prefer Castilian before their own language. A\r\nPortuguese writer, Innocencio da Silva, has gone the length of\r\nasserting that Montemôr wrote nothing but Castilian. This only proves\r\nthat Silva had not read the _Diana_, which contains two Portuguese\r\nsongs, and Portuguese prose passages spoken by the shepherd, Danteo,\r\nand the shepherdess, Duarda. Nor is Silva alone in his bad eminence;\r\nthe date of the earliest edition of the _Diana_ is commonly given as\r\n1542. Yet, as it contains, in the _Canto de Orpheo_, an allusion to the\r\nwidowhood of the Infanta Juana (1554), it must be later. The time of\r\npublication was probably 1558-59,[14] some four or five years after the\r\nprinting of his _Cancionero_ at Antwerp.\r\n\r\nLittle is known of Montemôr's life, save that he was a musician at\r\nthe Spanish court in 1548. He accompanied the Infanta Juana to Lisbon\r\non her marriage to Dom João, returning to Spain in 1554, when he is\r\nthought to have visited England and the Low Countries in Felipe II.'s\r\ntrain. He was murdered in 1651, apparently as the result of some amour.\r\nFaint intimations of pastoralism are found in such early chivalresque\r\nnovels as _Florisel de Niquea_, where Florisel, dressed as a shepherd,\r\nloves the shepherdess, Sylvia. Ribeiro had introduced his own flame\r\nin _Menina e moça_ in the person of Aonia, and Montemôr follows with\r\nDiana. The identification of Aonia with the Infanta Beatriz, and with\r\nKing Manoel's cousin, Joana de Vilhena, has been argued with great\r\nheat: in Montemôr's case the lady is said to have been a certain Ana.\r\nHer surname is withheld by the discreet Sepúlveda, who records that she\r\nwas seen at Valderas by Felipe III. and his queen in 1603.\r\n\r\nIn all pastoral novels there is a family likeness, and Montemôr is not\r\nsuccessful in avoiding the insipidity of the _genre_. He endeavours\r\nto lighten the monotony of his shepherds by borrowing Sannazaro's\r\ninvention of the witch whose magic draughts work miracles. This\r\nwonder-worker is as convenient for the novelist as she is tedious for\r\nthe reader, who is forced to cry out with Don Quixote's Priest:—\"Let\r\nall that refers to the wise Felicia and the enchanted water be\r\nomitted.\" The bold Priest would further drop the verses, honouring the\r\nbook for its prose, and for being the first of its class. Montemôr\r\naccepts the convention by making his shepherds—Sireno, Silvano, and\r\nthe rest—mouth it like grandiloquent dukes; but the style is correct,\r\nand pleasing in its grandiose kind. The _Diana's_ vogue was immense:\r\nShakespeare himself based the _Two Gentlemen of Verona_ upon the\r\nepisode of the shepherdess Felismena, which he had probably read in\r\nthe manuscript of Bartholomew Young, whose excellent version, although\r\nnot printed until 1598, was finished in 1583; and Sidney, whose own\r\npastoral is redolent of Montemôr, has given Sireno's song in this\r\nfashion:—\r\n\r\n  \"_Of this high grace with bliss conjoin'd\r\n    No further debt on me is laid,\r\n  Since that is self-same metal coin'd,\r\n    Sweet lady, you remain well paid.\r\n  For, if my place give me great pleasure,\r\n  Having before me Nature's treasure,\r\n    In face and eyes unmatchèd being,\r\n    You have the same in my hands, seeing\r\n  What in your face mine eyes do measure._\r\n\r\n  _Nor think the match unev'nly made,\r\n    That of those beams in you do tarry;\r\n  The glass to you but gives a shade,\r\n    To me mine eyes the true shape carry:\r\n  For such a thought most highly prizèd,\r\n  Which ever hath Love's yoke despisèd,\r\n    Better than one captiv'd perceiveth,\r\n    Though he the lively form receiveth,\r\n  The other sees it but disguisèd._\"\r\n\r\nMontemôr closes with the promise of a sequel, which never appeared.\r\nBut, as his popularity continued, publishers printed new editions,\r\ncontaining the story of Abindarraez and Jarifa, boldly annexed from\r\nVillegas' _Inventario_, which was licensed so early as 1551. The\r\ntempting opportunity was seized by Alonso Pérez, a Salamancan doctor,\r\nwhose second _Diana_ (1564) is extremely dull, despite the singular\r\nboast of its author that it contains scarcely anything \"not stolen or\r\nimitated from the best Latins and Italians.\" Pérez alleges that he\r\nwas a friend of Montemôr's; but, as that was his sole qualification,\r\nhis third _Diana_—written, though \"not added here, to avoid making\r\ntoo large a volume\"—has fortunately vanished. In this same year,\r\n1564, appeared Gaspar Gil Polo's _Diana_, a continuation which, says\r\nCervantes, should be guarded \"as though it were Apollo's\"—the praise\r\nhas perplexed readers who missed the pun on the author's name. The\r\nmerits of Polo's sequel, excellent in matter and form, were recognised,\r\nas Professor Rennert notes, by Jerónimo de Texeda, whose _Diana_ (1627)\r\nis a plagiary from Polo. Though the contents of the one and the other\r\nare almost identical, Ticknor, considering them as independent works,\r\nfinds praise for the earlier book, and blame for the later. An odd,\r\nmad freak is the versified _Diez libros de Fortuna de Amor_ (1573),\r\nwherein Frexano and Floricio woo Fortuna and Augustina in Arcadian\r\nfashion. Its author, the Sardinian soldier, Antonio Lo Frasso, shares\r\nwith Avellaneda the distinction of having drawn Cervantes' fire—his\r\none title to fame. Artificiality reaches its full height in the\r\n_Pastor de Fílida_ (1582) of Luis Gálvez de Montalvo, who presents\r\nhimself, Silvestre, and Cervantes as the (Dresden) shepherds Siralvo,\r\nSilvano, and Tirsi. Almost every Spanish man of letters attempted a\r\npastoral, but it were idle to compile a catalogue of works by authors\r\nwhose echoes of Montemôr are merely mechanical. The occasion of much\r\nornate prose, the pastoral lived partly because there was naught to\r\nset against it, partly because born men of action found pleasure in\r\nliterary idealism and in \"old Saturn's reign of sugar-candy.\" Its\r\nunreality doomed it to death when Alemán and others took to working\r\nthe realistic vein first struck in _Lazarillo de Tormes_. Meanwhile\r\nthe spectacle of love-lorn shepherds contending in song scandalised\r\nthe orthodox, and the monk Bartolomé Ponce produced his devout parody,\r\nthe _Clara Diana á lo divino_ (1599) in the same edifying spirit that\r\nmoved Sebastián de Córdoba (1577) to travesty Boscán's and Garcilaso's\r\nworks—_á lo divino, trasladadas en materias cristianas_.\r\n\r\nDidactic prose is practised by the official chronicler, JERÓNIMO DE\r\nZURITA (1512-80), author of the _Anales de la Corona de Aragón_, six\r\nfolios published between 1562 and 1580, and ending with the death of\r\nFernando. Zurita is not a great literary artist, nor an historical\r\nportrait-painter. Men's actions interest him less than the progress\r\nof constitutional growth. His conception of history, to give an\r\nillustration from English literature, is nearer Freeman's than\r\nFroude's, and he was admirably placed by fortune. Simancas being thrown\r\nopen to him, he was first among Spanish historians to use original\r\ndocuments, first to complete his authorities by study in foreign\r\narchives, first to perceive that travel is the complement of research.\r\nScience and Zurita's work gain by his determination to abandon the\r\nold plan of beginning with Noah. He lacks movement, sympathy, and\r\npicturesqueness; but he excels all predecessors in scheme, accuracy,\r\narchitectonics—qualities which have made his supersession impossible.\r\nWhatever else be read, Zurita's _Anales_ must be read also. His\r\ncontemporary, AMBROSIO DE MORALES (1513-91), nephew of Pérez de Oliva,\r\nwas charged to continue Ocampo's chronicle. His nomination is dated\r\n1580. His authoritative fragment, the result of ten years' labour,\r\ncombines eloquent narrative with critical instinct in such wise as to\r\nsuggest that, with better fortune, he might have matched Zurita.\r\n\r\nHurtado de Mendoza as a poet belongs to Carlos Quinto's period. Even\r\nif he be not the author of _Lazarillo_, he approves himself a master\r\nof prose in his _Guerra de Granada_, first published at Lisbon by\r\nthe editor of Figueroa's poems, Luis Tribaldos de Toledo, in 1627.\r\nMendoza wrote his story of the Morisco rising (1568-71) in the\r\nAlpujarra and Ronda ranges, while in exile at Granada. On July 22,\r\n1568 (if Fourquevaulx' testimony be exact), a quarrel arose between\r\nMendoza and a young courtier, Diego de Leiva. The old soldier—he was\r\nsixty-four—disarmed Leiva, threw his dagger out of window, and, by\r\nsome accounts, sent Leiva after it. This, passing in the royal palace\r\nat Madrid, was flat _lèse majesté_, to be expiated by Mendoza's exile.\r\nTo this lucky accident we owe the _Guerra de Granada_, written in the\r\nneighbourhood of the war.\r\n\r\nMendoza writes for the pleasure of writing, with no polemical or\r\ndidactic purpose. His plain-speaking concerning the war, and the part\r\nplayed in it by great personages whom he had no cause to love, accounts\r\nfor the tardy publication of his book, which should be considered as\r\na confidential state-paper by a diplomatist of genius. Yet, though\r\nhe wrote chiefly to pass the time, he has the qualities of the great\r\nhistorian—knowledge, impartiality, narrative power, condensation,\r\npsychological insight, dramatic apprehension, perspective and\r\neloquence. His view of a general situation is always just, and, though\r\nhe has something of the credulity of his time, his accuracy of detail\r\nis astonishing. His style is a thing apart. He had already shown, in\r\na burlesque letter addressed to Feliciano de Silva, an almost unique\r\ncapacity for reproducing that celebrity's literary manner. In his\r\n_Guerra de Granada_ he repeats the performance with more serious aim.\r\nOne god of his idolatry is Sallust, whose terse rhetoric is repeatedly\r\nechoed with unsurpassable fidelity. Another model is Tacitus, whose\r\nfamous description of Germanicus finding the unburied corpses of Varus'\r\nlegions is annexed by Mendoza in his account of Arcos and his troops\r\nat Calalín. This is neither plagiarism nor unconscious reminiscence;\r\nit is the deliberate effort of a prose connoisseur, saturated in\r\nantiquity, to impart the gloomy splendour of the Roman to his native\r\ntongue. To say that Mendoza succeeded were too much, but he did not\r\naltogether fail; and, despite his occasional Latinised construction,\r\nhis _Guerra de Granada_ lives not solely as a brilliant and picturesque\r\ntranscription. It is also a masterly example of idiomatic Castilian\r\nprose, published without the writer's last touches, and, as is plain,\r\nfrom mutilated copies.[15] Mendoza may not be a great historian: as a\r\nliterary artist he is extremely great.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[8] The sources are carefully traced by L.

Not merely has the Italian influence triumphed\r\ndefinitively: the chivalresque romance has well-nigh run its course;\r\nwhile mysticism and the pastoral have achieved expression and\r\nacceptance. Moreover, the most important of all developments is the\r\nestablishment of the stage at Madrid in the Teatro de la Cruz and in\r\nthe Teatro del Príncipe. There is evidence to prove that theatres were\r\nalso built at Valencia, at Seville, and possibly at Granada. Nor was a\r\nforeign impulse lacking. Kyd's _Spanish Tragedy_ records the invasion\r\nof England by Italian actors:—\r\n\r\n  \"_The Italian tragedians were so sharp of wit,\r\n  That in one hour's meditation\r\n  They could perform anything in action._\"\r\n\r\nIn like wise the famous Alberto Ganasa and his Italian histrions\r\nrevealed the art of acting to the Spains. Thenceforth every province is\r\noverrun by mummers, as may be read in the _Viaje entretenido_ (1603) of\r\nAgustín de Rojas Villandrando, who denotes, with mock-solemn precision,\r\nthe nine professional grades.\r\n\r\nThere was the solitary stroller, the _bululú_, tramping from village\r\nto village, declaiming short plays to small audiences, called together\r\nby the sacristan, the barber, and the parish priest, who—_pidiendo\r\nlimosna en un sombrero_—passed round the hat, and sped the vagabond\r\nwith a slice of bread and a cup of broth. A pair of strollers (such as\r\nRojas himself and his colleague Ríos) was styled a _ñaque_, and did no\r\nmore than spout simple _entremeses_ in the open. The _cangarilla_ was\r\non a larger scale, numbering three or four actors, who gave Timoneda's\r\n_Oveja Perdida_, or some comic piece wherein a boy played the woman's\r\npart. Five men and a woman made up the _carambaleo_, which performed in\r\nfarmhouses for such small wages as a loaf of bread, a bunch of grapes,\r\na stew of cabbage; but higher fees were asked in larger villages—six\r\n_maravedís_, a piece of sausage, a roll of flax, and what not. Though\r\n\"a spider could carry\" its properties, says Rojas, yet the _carambaleo_\r\ncontrived to fill the bill with a set piece, or two _autos_, or four\r\n_entremeses_. More pretentious was the _garnacha_, with its six men,\r\nits \"leading lady,\" and a boy who played the _ingénue_. With four set\r\nplays, three _autos_, and three _entremeses_ it would draw a whole\r\nvillage for a week. A large choice of pieces was within the means of\r\nthe seven men, two women, and a boy that made up the _bojiganga_,\r\nwhich journeyed from town to town on horseback. Next in rank came the\r\n_farándula_, the stepping-stone to the lofty _compañía_ of sixteen\r\nplayers, with fourteen \"supers,\" capable of producing fifty pieces at\r\nshort notice. To such a troupe, no doubt, belonged the Toledan Naharro,\r\nfamous as an interpreter of the bully, and as the foremost of Spanish\r\nstage-managers. \"He still further enriched theatrical adornment,\r\nsubstituting chests and trunks for the costume-bag. Into the body of\r\nthe house he brought the musicians, who had hitherto sung behind the\r\nblanket. He did away with the false beards which till then actors had\r\nalways worn, and he made all play without a make-up, save those who\r\nperformed old men's parts, or such characters as implied a change of\r\nappearance. He introduced machinery, clouds, thunder, lightning, duels,\r\nand battles; but this reached not the perfection of our day.\"\r\n\r\nThis is the testimony of the most renowned personality in Castilian\r\nliterature. MIGUEL DE CERVANTES SAAVEDRA (1547-1616) describes himself\r\nas a native of Alcalá de Henares, in a legal document signed at Madrid\r\non December 18, 1580: the long dispute as to his birthplace is thus\r\nat last settled. His stock was pure Castilian, its _solar_ being at\r\nCervatos, near Reinosa: the connection with Galicia is no older than\r\nthe fourteenth century. His family surname of Cervantes probably comes\r\nfrom the castle of San Cervantes, beyond Toledo, which was named after\r\nthe Christian martyr Servandus. The additional name of Saavedra is not\r\non the title-page of the writer's first book, the _Galatea_. However,\r\nMiguel de Cervantes uses the Saavedra in a petition addressed to Pope\r\nGregory XIII. and Felipe II. in October 1578; and, as Cervantes was\r\nnot then, though it is now, an uncommon name, the addition served to\r\ndistinguish the author from contemporary clansmen. He was the second\r\n(though not, as heretofore believed, the youngest) son of Rodrigo\r\nde Cervantes Saavedra and of Leonor Cortinas. Of the mother we know\r\nnothing: garrulous as was her famous son, he nowhere alludes to her,\r\nnor did he follow the usual Spanish practice by adding her surname to\r\nhis own. The father was a licentiate—of laws, so it is conjectured.\r\nResearch only yields two facts concerning him: that he was incurably\r\ndeaf, and that he was poor.\r\n\r\nCervantes' birthday is unknown. He was baptized at the Church of\r\nSanta María Mayor, in Alcalá de Henares, on Sunday, October 9, 1547.\r\nOne Tomás González asserted that he had found Cervantes' name in the\r\nmatriculation lists of Salamanca University; but the entry has never\r\nbeen verified since, and its report lacks probability. If Cervantes\r\never studied at any university, we should expect to find him at that\r\nof his native town, Alcalá de Henares. His name does not appear in\r\nthe University calendar. Though he made his knowledge go far, he was\r\nanything but learned, and college witlings bantered him for having\r\nno degree. No information exists concerning his youth. He is first\r\nmentioned in 1569, when a Madrid dominie, Juan López de Hoyos, speaks\r\nof him as \"our dear and beloved pupil\"; and some conjecture that he\r\nwas an usher in Hoyos' school. His earliest literary performance is\r\ndiscovered (1569) in a collection of verses on the death of Felipe\r\nII.'s third wife. The volume, edited by Hoyos, is entitled the\r\n_Historia y relación verdadera de la enfermedad, felicísimo tránsito\r\ny suntuosas exequias fúnebres de la Serenísima Reina de España, Doña\r\nIsabel de Valois_. Cervantes' contributions are an epitaph in sonnet\r\nform, five _redondillas_, and an elegy of one hundred and ninety-nine\r\nlines: this last being addressed to Cardinal Diego de Espinosa in the\r\nname of the whole school—_en nombre de todo el estudio_. These poor\r\npieces are reproduced solely because Cervantes wrote them: it is very\r\ndoubtful if he ever saw them in print. He is alleged to have been\r\nguilty of _lèse-majesté_ in Hurtado de Mendoza's fashion; but this is\r\nsurmise, as is also a pendant story of his love passages with a Maid\r\nof Honour. It is certain that, on September 15, 1569, a warrant was\r\nsigned for the arrest of one Miguel de Cervantes, who was condemned to\r\nlose his right hand for wounding Antonio de Sigura in the neighbourhood\r\nof the Court. There is nothing to prove that our man was the culprit;\r\nbut if he were, he had already got out of jurisdiction. Joining the\r\nhousehold of the Special Nuncio, Giulio Acquaviva, he left Madrid for\r\nRome as the Legate's chamberlain in the December of 1568.\r\n\r\nHe was not the stuff of which chamberlains are made; and in 1570 he\r\nenlisted in the company commanded by Diego de Urbina, captain in Miguel\r\nde Moncada's famous infantry regiment, at that time serving under Marc\r\nAntonio Colonna. It is worth noting that the _Galatea_ is dedicated\r\nto Marc Antonio's son, Ascanio Colonna, Abbot of St. Sophia. In 1571\r\nCervantes fought at Lepanto, where he was twice shot in the chest and\r\nhad his left hand maimed for life: \"for the greater honour of the\r\nright,\" as he loved to think and say with justifiable vainglory. That\r\nhe never tired of vaunting his share in the great victory is shown by\r\nhis frequent allusions to it in his writings; and it should almost seem\r\nthat he was prouder of his nickname—the Cripple of Lepanto—than of\r\nwriting _Don Quixote_. He served in the engagements before Navarino,\r\nCorfu, Tunis, the Goletta; and in all he bore himself with credit.\r\nReturning to Italy, he seems to have learned the language, for traces\r\nof Italian idioms are not rare even in his best pages. From Naples he\r\nsailed for Spain in September 1575, with recommendatory letters from\r\nDon Juan de Austria and from the Neapolitan Viceroy. On September 26,\r\nhis caravel, the _Sol_, was attacked by Moorish pirates, and, after a\r\nbrave resistance, all on board were carried as prisoners into Algiers.\r\nThere for five years Cervantes abode as a slave, writing plays between\r\nthe intervals of his plots to escape, striving to organise a general\r\nrising of the thousands of Christians. Being the most dangerous,\r\nbecause the most heroic of them all, he became, in some sort, the chief\r\nof his fellows, and, after the failure of several plans for flight,\r\nwas held hostage by the Dey for the town's safety. His release was due\r\nto accident. On September 19, 1580, the Redemptorist, Fray Juan Gil,\r\noffered five hundred gold ducats as the ransom of a private gentleman\r\nnamed Jerónimo Palafox. The sum was held insufficient to redeem a man\r\nof Palafox's position; but it sufficed to set free Cervantes, who was\r\nalready shipped on the Dey's galley bound for Constantinople.[16] He\r\nis found at Madrid on December 19, 1580, and it is surmised that he\r\nserved in Portugal and at the Azores. There are rumours of his holding\r\nsome small post at Oran: however that may be, he returned to Spain, at\r\nlatest, in the autumn of 1582. And henceforth he belongs to literature.\r\n\r\nThe plays written at Algiers are lost; but there survive two sonnets\r\nof the same period dedicated to Rufino de Chamberí (1577). A rhymed\r\nepistle to the Secretary of State, Mateo Vázquez, also belongs to this\r\ntime. We must suppose Cervantes to have written copiously on regaining\r\nhis liberty, since Gálvez de Montalvo speaks of him as a poet of repute\r\nin the _Pastor de Fílida_ (1582); but the earliest signs of him in\r\nSpain are his eulogistic sonnets in Padilla's _Romancero_ and Rufo\r\nGutiérrez' _Austriada_, both published in 1583. Padilla repaid the debt\r\nby classing the sonneteer among \"the most famous poets of Castile.\"\r\nIn December 1584, Cervantes married Catalina de Palacios Salazar y\r\nVozmediano, a native of Esquivias, eighteen years younger than himself.\r\nIt is often said that he wrote the _Galatea_ as a means of furthering\r\nhis suit. It may be so. But the book was not printed by Juan Gracián\r\nof Alcalá de Henares till March 1585, though the _aprobación_ and the\r\nprivilege are dated February 1 and February 22, 1584. In the year after\r\nhis marriage, Cervantes' illegitimate daughter, Isabel de Saavedra,\r\nwas born. We shall have occasion to refer to her later. Our immediate\r\nconcern is with the _Primera Parte de Galatea_, an unfinished pastoral\r\nnovel in six books, for which Cervantes received 1336 _reales_ from\r\nBlas de Robles; a sum which, with his wife's small dowry, enabled him\r\nto start housekeeping.[17] As a financial speculation the _Galatea_\r\nfailed: only two later editions appeared during the writer's lifetime,\r\none at Lisbon in 1590, the other at Paris in 1611. Neither could have\r\nbrought him money; but the book, if it did nothing else, served to make\r\nhim known.\r\n\r\nHe trimmed his sails to the popular breeze. Montemôr had started\r\nthe pastoral fashion, Pérez and Gaspar Gil Polo had followed, and\r\nGálvez de Montalvo maintained the tradition. Later in life, in the\r\n_Coloquio de los Perros_ (Dialogue of the Dogs), Cervantes made his\r\nBerganza say that all pastorals are \"vain imaginings, void of truth,\r\nwritten to amuse the idle\"; yet it may be doubted if Cervantes ever\r\nlost the pastoral taste, though his sense of humour forced him to see\r\nthe absurdity of the convention. It is very certain that he had a\r\nspecial fondness for the _Galatea_: he spared it at the burning of Don\r\nQuixote's library, praised its invention, and made the Priest exhort\r\nthe Barber to await the sequel which is foreshadowed in the _Galatea's_\r\ntext. This is again promised in the Dedication of the volume of plays\r\n(1615), in the Prologue to the Second Part of _Don Quixote_ (1615),\r\nand in the Letter Dedicatory of _Persiles y Sigismunda_, signed on\r\nthe writer's deathbed, April 19, 1616. For thirty-one years Cervantes\r\nheld out the promise of the _Galatea's_ Second Part: five times did he\r\nrepeat it. It is plain that he thought well of the First, and that his\r\nliking for the _genre_ was incorrigible.\r\n\r\nHis own attempt survives chiefly because of the name on its\r\ntitle-page. Pastorals differ little in essentials, and the kind offers\r\nfew openings to Cervantes' peculiar humoristic genius. Like his\r\nfellow-practitioners, he crowds his stage with figures: he presents his\r\nshepherds Elicio and Erastro warbling their love for Galatea on Tagus\r\nbank; he reveals Mirenio enamoured of Silveria, Leonarda love-sick\r\nfor Salercio, Lenio in the toils of Gelasia. Hazlitt, in his harsh\r\ncriticism of Sidney's _Arcadia_, hits the defects of the pastoral, and\r\nhis censures may be justly applied to the _Galatea_. There, as in the\r\nEnglish book, we find the \"original sin of alliteration, antithesis,\r\nand metaphysical conceit\"; there, too, is the \"systematic interpolation\r\nof the wit, learning, ingenuity, wisdom, and everlasting impertinence\r\nof the writer.\" Worst of all are \"the continual, uncalled-for\r\ninterruptions, analysing, dissecting, disjointing, murdering\r\neverything, and reading a pragmatical, self-sufficient lecture over the\r\ndead body of nature.\" But if Cervantes sins in this wise, he sins of\r\nset purpose and in good company. In his Fourth Book, he interpolates a\r\nlong disquisition on the Beautiful which he calmly annexes from Judas\r\nAbarbanel's _Dialoghi_. As Sannazaro opens his _Arcadia_ with Ergasto\r\nand Selvaggio, so Cervantes thrusts his Elicio and Erastro into the\r\nforeground of the _Galatea_; the funeral of Meliso is a deliberate\r\nimitation of the Feast of Pales; and, as the Italian introduced\r\nCarmosina Bonifacia under the name of Amaranta, the Spaniard perforce\r\ngives Catalina de Palacios Salazar as Galatea. Nor does he depart\r\nfrom the convention by placing himself upon the scene as Elicio, for\r\nRibeiro and Montemôr had preceded him in the characters of Bimnardel\r\nand Sereno. Lastly, the idea and the form of the _Canto de Calíope_,\r\nwherein the uncritical poet celebrates whole tribes of contemporary\r\nsingers, are borrowed from the _Canto del Turia_, which Gil Polo had\r\ninterpolated in his _Diana_.\r\n\r\nProlixity, artifice, ostentation, monotony, extravagance, are\r\ninherent in the pastoral school; and the _Galatea_ savours of these\r\ndefects. Yet, for all its weakness, it lacks neither imagination nor\r\ncontrivance, and its embroidered rhetoric is a fine example of stately\r\nprose. Save, perhaps, in the _Persiles y Sigismunda_, Cervantes never\r\nwrote with a more conscious effort after excellence, and, in results\r\nof absolute style, the _Galatea_ may compare with all but exceptional\r\npassages in _Don Quixote_. Yet it failed to please, and the author\r\nturned to other fields of effort. His verses in Pedro de Padilla's\r\n_Jardín Espiritual_ (1585) and in López Maldonado's _Cancionero_ (1586)\r\ndenote good-nature and a love of literature; and in both volumes\r\nCervantes may have read companion-pieces written by a marvellous youth,\r\nLope de Vega, whom he had already praised—as he praised everybody—in\r\nthe _Canto de Calíope_. He could not foresee that in the person of\r\nthis boy he was to meet his match and more. Meanwhile in 1587 he\r\npenned sonnets for Padilla's _Grandezas y Excelencias de la Virgen_,\r\nand for Alonso de Barros' _Filosofía cortesana_. Verse-making was his\r\ncraze; and, in 1588, when the physician, Francisco Díaz, published a\r\ntreatise on kidney disease—_Tratado nuevamente impreso acerca de las\r\nenfermedades de los riñones_—the unwearied poetaster was forthcoming\r\nwith a sonnet pat to the strange occasion.\r\n\r\nStill, though he cultivated verse with as sedulous a passion as Don\r\nQuixote spent on Knight-Errantries, he recognised that man does not\r\nlive by sonneteering alone, and he tried his fate upon the boards. He\r\ndied with the happy conviction that he was a dramatist of genius; his\r\ncontemporaries ruled the point against him, and posterity has upheld\r\nthe decision. He tells us that at this time he wrote between twenty and\r\nthirty plays. We only know the titles of a few among them—the _Gran\r\nTurquesca_, the _Jerusalén_, the _Batalla Naval_ (attributed by Moratín\r\nto the year 1584), the _Amaranta_ and the _Bosque Amoroso_ (referred\r\nto 1586), the _Arsinda_ and the _Confusa_ (to 1587). It is like enough\r\nthat the _Batalla Naval_ was concerned with Lepanto, a subject of which\r\nCervantes never tired; the _Arsinda_ existed so late as 1673, when Juan\r\nde Matos Fragoso mentioned it as \"famous\" in his _Corsaria Catalana_;\r\nand our author himself ranked the _Confusa_ as \"good among the best.\"\r\nThe touch of self-complacency is amusing, though one might desire a\r\nbetter security than Bardolph's.\r\n\r\nTwo surviving plays of the period are _El Trato de Argel_ and _La\r\nNumancia_, first printed by Antonio de Sancha in 1784. The former deals\r\nwith the life of the Christian slaves in Algiers, and recounts the\r\npassion of Zara the Moor for the captive Aurelio, who is enamoured of\r\nSilvia. We must assume that Cervantes thought well of this invention,\r\nsince he utilised it some thirty years later in _El Amante Liberal_;\r\nbut the play is merely futile. The introduction of a lion, of the\r\nDevil, and of such abstractions as Necessity and Opportunity, is as\r\npoor a piece of machinery as theatre ever saw; the versification\r\nis rough and creaking, improvised without care or conscience; the\r\nsituations are arranged with a glaring disregard for truth and\r\nprobability. Like Paolo Veronese, Cervantes could rarely resist the\r\ntemptation of painting himself into his canvas, and in _El Trato de\r\nArgel_ he takes care that the prisoner Saavedra should declaim his\r\ntirade. The piece has no dramatic interest, and is valuable merely\r\nas an over-coloured picture of vicissitudes by one who knew them at\r\nfirst-hand, and who presented them to his countrymen with a more or\r\nless didactic intention. Yet, even as a transcript of manners, this\r\nluckless play is a failure.\r\n\r\nA finer example of Cervantes' dramatic power is the _Numancia_, on\r\nwhich Shelley has passed this generous judgment:—\"I have read the\r\n_Numancia_, and, after wading through the singular stupidity of the\r\nFirst Act, began to be greatly delighted, and at length interested in\r\na very high degree, by the power of the writer in awakening pity and\r\nadmiration, in which I hardly know by whom he is excelled. There is\r\nlittle, I allow, to be called _poetry_ in this play; but the command\r\nof language and the harmony of versification is so great as to deceive\r\none into an idea that it is poetry.\" Nor is Shelley alone in his\r\nadmiration. Goethe's avowal to Humboldt is on record:—\"Sogar habe\r\nich ... neulich das Trauerspiel _Numancia_ von Cervantes mit vielem\r\nVergnügen gelesen;\" but eight years later he confided a revised\r\njudgment to Riemer. The gushing school of German Romantics waxed\r\ndelirious in praise. Thus Friedrich Schlegel surpassed himself by\r\ncalling the play \"godlike\"; and August Schlegel, not content to hold it\r\nfor a dramatic masterpiece, would persuade us to accept it for great\r\npoetry. Even Sismondi declares that \"le frisson de l'horreur et de\r\nl'effroi devient presque un supplice pour le spectateur.\"\r\n\r\nRaptures apart, the _Numancia_ is Cervantes' best play. He has a\r\ngrandiose subject: the siege of Numantia, and its capture by Scipio\r\nAfricanus after fourteen years of resistance. On the Roman side were\r\neighty thousand soldiers; the Spaniards numbered four thousand or less;\r\nand the victors entered the fallen city to find no soul alive. With\r\nscenes of valour is mingled the pathetic love-story of Morandro and\r\nLyra. But, once again, Cervantes fails as a dramatic artist; one doubts\r\nif he knew what a plot was, what unity of conception meant. He has\r\nscenes and episodes of high excellence, but they are detached from the\r\nmain composition, and produce all the bad effect of a portrait painted\r\nin different lights. Abstractions fill the stage—War, Sickness,\r\nHunger, Spain, the river Duero. But the tirades of rhetoric are\r\nunsurpassed by anything from Cervantes' pen, and Marquino's scene with\r\nthe corpse in the Second Act is pregnant with a suggestion of weirdness\r\nwhich Mr. Gibson has well conveyed:—\r\n\r\nMarquino.\r\n\r\n  \"_What! Dost not answer? Dost not live again,\r\n  Or haply hast thou tasted death once more?\r\n  Then will I quicken thee anew with pain,\r\n  And for thy good the gift of speech restore.\r\n  Since thou art one of us, do not disdain\r\n  To speak and answer, as I now implore;...\r\n  Ye spirits vile, it worketh not ye trust!\r\n  But wait, for soon the enchanted water here\r\n  Will show my will to be as strong and just\r\n  As yours is treacherous and insincere.\r\n  And though this flesh were turned to very dust,\r\n  Yet being quickened by this lash austere,\r\n  Which cuts with cruel rigour like a knife,\r\n  It will regain a new though fleeting life.\r\n  Thou rebel soul, seek now the home again\r\n  Thou leftest empty these few hours ago._\r\n\r\nThe Body.\r\n\r\n  _Restrain the fury of thy reckless pain;\r\n  Suffice it, O Marquino, man of woe,\r\n  What I do suffer in the realms obscure,\r\n  Nor give me pangs more fearful to endure.\r\n  Thou errest, if thou thinkest that I crave\r\n  This painful, pinched, and narrow life I have,\r\n  Which even now is ebbing fast away,...\r\n  Since Death a second time, with bitter sway,\r\n  Will triumph over me in life and soul,\r\n  And gain a double palm, beyond control.\r\n  For he and others of the dismal band,\r\n  Who do thy bidding subject to thy spell,\r\n  Are raging round and round, and waiting stand,\r\n  Till I shall finish what I have to tell....\r\n  The Romans ne'er shall victory obtain\r\n  O'er proud Numantia; still less shall she\r\n  A glorious triumph o'er her foemen gain;\r\n  'Twixt friends and foes, both have to a degree,\r\n  Think not that settled peace shall ever reign\r\n  Where rage meets rage in strife eternally.\r\n  The friendly hand, with homicidal knife,\r\n  Will slay Numantia and will give her life._\r\n        [He hurls himself into the sepulchre, and says:—\r\n  _I say no more, Marquino, time is fleet;\r\n  The Fates will grant to me no more delay,\r\n  And, though my words may seem to thee deceit,\r\n  Thou'lt find at last the truth of what I say._\"\r\n\r\nEven in translation—still more in the original—the rhetoric of\r\nthis passage is imposing; yet we perceive rhetoric to be contagious\r\nwhen Ticknor asserts that \"there is nothing of so much dignity in\r\nthe incantations of Marlowe's _Faustus_.\" Still more amazing is\r\nTicknor's second appreciation:—\"Nor does even Shakspeare demand from\r\nus a sympathy so strange with the mortal head reluctantly rising to\r\nanswer Macbeth's guilty question, as Cervantes makes us feel for this\r\nsuffering spirit, recalled to life only to endure a second time the\r\npangs of dissolution.\" The school is decently interred which mistook\r\ncritics for Civil Service Commissioners, and Parnassus for Burlington\r\nHouse. It is impossible to compare Cervantes' sonorous periods and\r\nMarlowe's majestic eloquence, nor is it less unwise to match his moving\r\nmelodrama against one of the greatest tragedies in the world. His great\r\nscene has its own merit as an artificial embellishment, as a rhetorical\r\nadornment, as an exercise in bravura; but the episode is not only out\r\nof place where it is found—it leads from nowhere to nothing. More\r\ndramatic in spirit and effect is the speech declaimed by Scipio when\r\nthe last Numantian, Viriato, hurls himself from the tower:—\r\n\r\n  \"_O matchless action, worthy of the meed\r\n  Which old and valiant soldiers love to gain!\r\n  Thou hast achieved a glory by thy deed,\r\n  Not only for Numantia, but for Spain!\r\n  Thy valour strange, heroical in deed,\r\n  Hath robbed me of my rights, and made them vain;\r\n  For with thy fall thou hast upraised thy fame,\r\n  And levelled down my victories to shame!\r\n  Oh, could Numantia gain what she hath lost,\r\n  I would rejoice, if but to see thee there!\r\n  For thou hast reaped the gain and honour most\r\n  Of this long siege, illustrious and rare!\r\n  Bear thou, O stripling, bear away the boast,\r\n  Enjoy the glory which the Heavens prepare,\r\n  For thou hast conquered, by thy very fall,\r\n  Him who in rising falleth worst of all._\"\r\n\r\nHere, once more, we are dealing with a passage which gains by\r\ndetachment from its context. To speak plainly, the interest of the\r\n_Numancia_ is not dramatic, and its versification, good of its kind,\r\nmay easily be overpraised, as it was by Shelley. First and last, the\r\nplay is a devout and passionate expression of patriotism; and, as\r\nsuch, the writer's countrymen have held it in esteem, never claiming\r\nfor it the qualities invented by well-meaning foreigners. Lope de Vega\r\nand Calderón still hold the stage, from which Cervantes, the disciple\r\nof Virués, was driven three centuries ago; and they survive, the one\r\nas an hundredfold more potent dramatist, the other as an infinitely\r\ngreater poet. Yet, like the ghost raised by Marquino, Cervantes was\r\nto undergo a momentary resurrection. When Palafox (and Byron's Maid)\r\nheld Zaragoza, during the War of Independence, against the batteries\r\nof Mortier, Junot, and Lannes, the _Numancia_ was played within the\r\nbesieged walls, so that Spaniards of the nineteenth century might see\r\nthat their fathers had known how to die for freedom. The tragedy was\r\nreceived with enthusiasm; the marshals of the world's Greatest Captain\r\nwere repulsed and beaten; and Cervantes' inspiriting lines helped on\r\nthe victory. In life, he had never met with such a triumph, and in\r\ndeath no other could have pleased him better.\r\n\r\nHe asserts, indeed, that his plays were popular, and he may have\r\npersuaded himself into that belief. His idolaters preach the legend\r\nthat he was driven from the boards by that \"portent of genius,\" Lope\r\nde Vega. This tale is a vain imagining. Cervantes failed so wretchedly\r\nin art that in 1588 he left the Madrid stage to seek work in Seville;\r\nand no play of Lope's dates so early as that, save one written while\r\nhe was at school. In June 1588, Cervantes became Deputy-Purveyor to\r\nthe Invincible Armada, and in May 1590 he petitioned for one of four\r\nappointments vacant in Granada, Guatemala, Cartagena, and La Paz. But\r\nhe never quite abandoned literature. In 1591 he wrote a _romance_\r\nfor Andrés de Villalba's _Flor de varios y nuevos romances_, and, in\r\nthe following year, he contracted with the Seville manager, Rodrigo\r\nOsorio, to write six comedies at fifty ducats each—no money to be paid\r\nunless Osorio should rank the plays \"among the best in Spain.\" No more\r\nis heard of this agreement, and Cervantes disappears till 1594, when\r\nhe was appointed tax-gatherer in Granada. Next year he competed at a\r\nliterary tournament held by the Dominicans of Zaragoza in honour of\r\nSt. Hyacinth, and won the first prize—three silver spoons. His sonnet\r\nto the famous sea-dog, Santa Cruz, is printed in Cristóbal Mosquera\r\nde Figueroa's _Comentario en breve Compendio de Disciplina militar_\r\n(1596), and his bitter sonnet on Medina Sidonia's entry into Cádiz,\r\nalready sacked and evacuated by Essex, is of the same date.\r\n\r\nIn 1597, being in Seville about the time of Herrera's death, Cervantes\r\nwrote his sonnet in memory of the great Andalucían. In September of\r\nthis year the sonneteer was imprisoned for irregularities in his\r\naccounts, due to his having entrusted Government funds to one Simón\r\nFreire de Lima, who absconded with the booty. Released some three\r\nmonths later, Cervantes was sent packing by the Treasury, and was never\r\nmore employed in the public service. Lost, as it seemed, to hope and\r\nfame, the ruined man lingered at Seville, where, in 1598, he wrote two\r\nsonnets and a copy of _quintillas_ on Felipe II.'s death. Four years of\r\nsilence were followed by the inevitable sonnet in the second edition of\r\nLope de Vega's _Dragontea_ (1602). It is certain that all this while\r\nCervantes was scribbling in some naked garret; but his name seemed\r\nalmost forgotten from the earth. In 1603 he was run to ground, and\r\nserved with an Exchequer writ concerning those outstanding balances,\r\nstill unpaid after nearly eight years. He must appear in person at\r\nValladolid to offer what excuse he might. Light as his baggage was,\r\nit contained one precious, immediate jewel—the manuscript of _Don\r\nQuixote_. The Treasury soon found that to squeeze money from him was\r\nharder than to draw blood from a stone: the debt remained unsettled.\r\nBut his journey was not in vain. On his way to Valladolid, he found a\r\npublisher for _Don Quixote_. The Royal Privilege is dated September\r\n26, 1604, and in January 1605 the book was sold at Madrid across the\r\ncounter of Francisco de Robles, bookseller to the King. Cervantes\r\ndedicated his volume, in terms boldly filched from Herrera and Medina,\r\nto the Duque de Béjar. In a previous age the author's kinsman had\r\nanticipated the compliment by addressing a gloss of Jorge Manrique's\r\n_Coplas_ to Álvaro de Stúñiga, second Duque de Béjar.\r\n\r\nIt is difficult to say when _Don Quixote_ was written; later,\r\ncertainly, than 1591, for it alludes to Bernardo de la Vega's _Pastor\r\nde Iberia_, published in that year. Legend says that the First Part\r\nwas begun in gaol, and so Langford includes it in his _Prison Books\r\nand their Authors_. The only ground for the belief is a phrase in the\r\nPrologue which describes the work as \"a dry, shrivelled, whimsical\r\noffspring ... just what might be begotten in a prison.\" This may be a\r\nmere figure of speech; yet the tradition persists that Cervantes wrote\r\nhis masterpiece in the cellar of the Casa de Medrano at Argamasilla de\r\nAlba. Certain it is that Argamasilla is Don Quixote's native town. The\r\nburlesque verses at the end indicate precisely that \"certain village\r\nin La Mancha, the name of which,\" says Cervantes dryly, \"I have no\r\ndesire to recall.\" Quevedo witnesses that the fact was accepted by\r\ncontemporaries, and topography puts it beyond doubt. The manuscript\r\npassed through many hands before reaching the printer, Cuesta: whence\r\na double mention of it before publication. The author of the _Pícara\r\nJustina_, who anticipated Cervantes' poor device of the _versos de\r\ncabo roto_—truncated rhymes—in _Don Quixote_, ranks the book beside\r\nthe _Celestina_, _Lazarillo de Tormes_, and _Guzmán de Alfarache_; yet\r\nthe _Pícara Justina_ was licensed on August 22, 1604. The title falls\r\nfrom a far more illustrious pen: in a private letter written on August\r\n14, 1604, Lope de Vega observes that no budding poet \"is so bad as\r\nCervantes, none so silly as to praise _Don Quixote_.\" There will be\r\noccasion to return presently to this much-quoted remark.\r\n\r\nClearly the book was discussed, and not always approved, by literary\r\ncritics some months before it was in print: but critics of all\r\ngenerations have been taught that their opinions go for nothing\r\nwith the public, which persists in being amused against rules and\r\ndogmas. _Don Quixote_ carried everything before it: its vogue almost\r\nequalled that of _Guzmán de Alfarache_, and by July a fifth edition\r\nwas preparing at Valencia. Cervantes has told us his purpose in plain\r\nwords:—\"to diminish the authority and acceptance that books of\r\nchivalry have in the world and among the vulgar.\" Yet his own avowal\r\nis rejected. Defoe averred that _Don Quixote_ was a satire on Medina\r\nSidonia; Landor applauded the book as \"the most dexterous attack ever\r\nmade against the worship of the Virgin\"; and such later crocheteers\r\nas Rawdon Brown have industriously proved Sancho Panza to be Pedro\r\nFranqueza, and the whole novel to be a burlesque on contemporary\r\npolitics.[18]\r\n\r\nCervantes was unlucky in life, nor did his misfortunes end with his\r\ndays. Posthumous idolatry seeks to atone for contemporary neglect, and\r\nthere has come into being a tribe of ignorant fakirs, assuming the\r\ntitle of \"Cervantophils,\" and seeking to convert a man of genius into a\r\ncommon Mumbo-Jumbo. A master of invention, a humourist beyond compare,\r\nan expert in ironic observation, a fellow meet for Shakespeare's self:\r\nall that suffices not for these fanatical dullards. Their deity must be\r\naccepted also as a poet, a philosophic thinker, a Puritan tub-thumper,\r\na political reformer, a finished scholar, a purist in language,\r\nand—not least amazing—an ascetic in private morals. A whole shelf\r\nmight be filled with works upon Cervantes the doctor, Cervantes the\r\nlawyer, the sailor, the geographer, and who knows what else? Like his\r\ncontemporary Shakespeare, Cervantes took a peculiar interest in cases\r\nof dementia; and, in England and Spain, the afflicted have shown both\r\nauthors much reciprocal attention. We must even take Cervantes as he\r\nwas: a literary artist stronger in practice than in theory, great by\r\nnatural faculty rather than by acquired accomplishment. His learning\r\nis naught, his reasonings are futile, his speculation is banal. In\r\nshort passages he is one of the greatest masters of Castilian prose,\r\nclear, direct, and puissant: but he soon tires, and is prone to lapse\r\ninto Italian idioms, or into irritating sentences packed with needless\r\nrelatives. Cervantes lives not as a great practitioner in style, a\r\nsultan of epithet—though none could better him when he chose; nor\r\nis he potent as a purely intellectual influence. He is immortal by\r\nreason of his creative power, his imaginative resource, his wealth of\r\ninvention, his penetrating vision, his inimitable humour, his boundless\r\nsympathy. Hence the universality of his appeal: hence the splendour of\r\nhis secular renown.\r\n\r\nIt is certain that he builded better than he knew, and that not even\r\nhe realised the full scope of his work: we know from Goethe that the\r\nmaker has to be taught his own meaning. The contemporary allusions,\r\nthe sly hits at foes, are mostly mysteries for us, though they amuse\r\nthe laborious leisure of the commentator. Chivalresque romances are\r\nwith last year's snows: but the interest of _Don Quixote_ abides for\r\never. Cervantes set out intending to write a comic short story, and the\r\ndesign grew under his hand till at length it included a whole Human\r\nComedy. He himself was as near akin to Don Quixote as a man may be:\r\nhe knew his chivalresque romances by heart, and accounted _Amadís de\r\nGaula_ as \"the very best contrived book of all those of that kind.\" Yet\r\nhe has been accused by his own people of plotting his country's ruin,\r\nand has been held up to contempt as \"the headsman and the ax of Spain's\r\nhonour.\" Byron repeats the ridiculous taunt:—\r\n\r\n  \"_Cervantes smiled Spain's chivalry away;\r\n    A single laugh demolished the right arm\r\n  Of his own country; seldom since that day\r\n    Has Spain had heroes. While Romance could charm,\r\n  The world gave ground before her bright array;\r\n    And therefore have his volumes done such harm,\r\n  That all their glory, as a composition,\r\n  Was dearly purchased by his land's perdition._\"\r\n\r\nThe chivalresque madness was well-nigh over when our author made his\r\nonset: he but hastened the end. After the publication of _Don Quixote_,\r\nno new chivalresque romance was written, and only one—the _Caballero\r\ndel Febo_ (1617)—was reprinted. And the reason is obvious. It was\r\nnot that Cervantes' work was merely destructive, that he was simply\r\na clever artist in travesty: it was that he gave better than he took\r\naway, and that he revealed himself, not only to Spain, but to the\r\nworld, as a great creative master, and an irresistible, because an\r\nuniversal, humourist.\r\n\r\nThere is endless discussion as to the significance of his masterpiece,\r\nand the acutest critics have uttered \"great argument about it and\r\nabout.\" That an allegory of human life was intended is incredible.\r\nCervantes presents the Ingenious Gentleman as the Prince of Courtesy,\r\naffable, gallant, wise on all points save that trifling one which\r\nannihilates Time and Space and changes the aspect of the Universe:\r\nand he attaches to him, Sancho, self-seeking, cautious, practical in\r\npresence of vulgar opportunities. The types are eternal. But it were\r\ntoo much to assume that there exists any conscious symbolic or esoteric\r\npurpose in the dual presentation. Cervantes is inspired solely by the\r\nartistic intention which would create personages, and would divert by\r\nabundance of ingenious fantasy, by sublimation of character, by wealth\r\nof episode and incident, and by the genius of satiric portraiture. He\r\ntessellates with whatsoever mosaic chances to strike his fancy. It may\r\nbe that he inlays his work with such a typical sonnet as that which Mr.\r\nGosse has transferred from the twenty-third chapter of _Don Quixote_\r\nto _In Russet and Silver_—an excellent example, which shall be quoted\r\nhere:—\r\n\r\n  \"_When I was marked for suffering, Love forswore\r\n    All knowledge of my doom: or else at ease\r\n    Love grows a cruel tyrant, hard to please;\r\n  Or else a chastisement exceeding sore\r\n  A little sin hath brought me. Hush! no more!\r\n    Love is a god! all things he knows and sees,\r\n    And gods are bland and mild! Who then decrees\r\n  The dreadful woe I bear and yet adore?\r\n  If I should say, O Phyllis, that 'twas thou,\r\n    I should speak falsely, since, being wholly good\r\n      Like Heaven itself, from thee no ill may come.\r\n  There is no hope; I must die shortly now,\r\n    Not knowing why, since sure no witch hath brewed\r\n      The drug that might avert my martyrdom._\"\r\n\r\nHereunto the writer adds reminiscences of slavery, picaresque scenes\r\nobserved during his vagabond life as tax-gatherer, tales of Italian\r\nintrigue re-echoed from Bandello, flouts at Lope de Vega, a treasure\r\nof adventures and experience, a strain of mockery both individual\r\nand general. Small wonder if the world received _Don Quixote_ with\r\ndelight! There was nothing like unto it before: there has been nothing\r\nto eclipse it since. It ends one epoch and begins another: it intones\r\nthe dirge of the mediæval novel: it announces the arrival of the new\r\ngenerations, and it belongs to both the past and the coming ages. At\r\nthe point where the paths diverge, _Don Quixote_ stands, dominating\r\nthe entire landscape of fiction. Time has failed to wither its variety\r\nor to lessen its force, and posterity accepts it as a masterpiece of\r\nhumoristic fancy, of complete observation and unsurpassed invention.\r\nIt ceases, in effect, to belong to Spain as a mere local possession,\r\nthough nothing can deprive her of the glory of producing it. Cervantes\r\nranks with Shakespeare and with Homer as a citizen of the world, a man\r\nof all times and countries, and _Don Quixote_, with _Hamlet_ and the\r\n_Iliad_, belongs to universal literature, and is become an eternal\r\npleasaunce of the mind for all the nations.\r\n\r\nCervantes had his immediate reward in general acceptance. Reprints of\r\nhis book followed in Spain, and in 1607 the original was reproduced\r\nat Brussels. The French teacher of Spanish, César Oudin, interpolated\r\nthe tale of the _Curious Impertinent_ between the covers of Julio\r\nIñíguez de Medrano's _Silva Curiosa_, published for the second time\r\nat Paris in 1608; in the same year Jean Baudouin did this story into\r\nFrench, and in 1609 an anonymous arrangement of Marcela's story was\r\nGallicised as _Le Meurtre de la Fidélité et la Défense de l'Honneur_.\r\nThis sufficed for fame: yet Cervantes made no instant attempt to repeat\r\nhis triumph. For eight years he was silent, save for occasional copies\r\nof verse. The baptism of the future Felipe IV., and the embassy of Lord\r\nNottingham—best known as Howard of Effingham, the admiral in command\r\nagainst the Invincible Armada—are recorded in courtly fashion by\r\nthe anonymous writer of a pamphlet entitled _Relación de lo sucedido\r\nen la Ciudad de Valladolid_. Góngora, who dealt with both subjects,\r\nflouts Cervantes as the pamphleteer; but the authorship is doubtful.\r\nCervantes is next heard of in custody on suspicion of knowing more\r\nthan he chose to tell concerning the death of Gaspar de Ezpeleta,\r\nin June 1605. Legend makes Ezpeleta the lover of Cervantes' natural\r\ndaughter, Isabel de Saavedra: \"the point of honour\" at once suggests\r\nitself, and the incident has inspired both dramatists and novelists.\r\nA conspiracy of silence on the part of biographers has done Cervantes\r\nmuch wrong, and is responsible for exaggerated stories of his guilt. He\r\nwas discharged after inquiry, and seems to have been entirely innocent\r\nof contriving Ezpeleta's end. Many romantic stories have gathered\r\nabout the personality of Isabel: she has been passed upon us as the\r\ndaughter of a Portuguese \"lady of high quality,\" and the prop of her\r\nfather's declining days. These are idolatrous inventions: we now know\r\nfor certain that her mother's name was Ana Franca de Rojas, a poor\r\nwoman married to Alonso Rodríguez, and that the girl herself (who in\r\n1605 was unable to read and write) was indentured as general servant to\r\nCervantes' sister, Magdalena de Sotomayor, in August 1599.[19] Thence\r\nshe passed to Cervantes' household, and it is even alleged that she was\r\ntwice married in her father's lifetime. She has been so picturesquely\r\npresented by imaginative \"Cervantophils,\" that it is necessary to state\r\nthe humble truth here and now, for the first time in English. Thus\r\nthe grotesque travesty of Cervantes as a plaster saint returns to the\r\nFather of Lies, who begat it. Confirmation of his exploits as a loose\r\nliver in gaming-houses is afforded by the _Memorias de Valladolid_, now\r\namong the manuscripts in the British Museum.[20]\r\n\r\nSuch diversions as these left him scant time for literature. The space\r\nbetween 1605 and 1608 yields the pitiful show of three sonnets in four\r\nyears: _To a Hermit_, _To the Conde de Saldaña_, _To a Braggart turned\r\nBeggar_. Even this last is sometimes referred to Quevedo. It should\r\nhardly seem that prosperity suited Cervantes. Meanwhile, his womenfolk\r\ngained their bread by taking in the Marqués de Villafranca's sewing.\r\nStill, he made no sign: the author of _Don Quixote_ sank lower and\r\nlower, writing letters for illiterates at a small fee. The _Letter\r\nto Don Diego de Astudillo Carrillo_, the _Story of what happens in\r\nSeville Gaol_ (a sequel to Cristóbal de Chaves' sketch made twenty\r\nyears before), the _Dialogue between Sillenia and Selanio_, the three\r\n_entremeses_ entitled _Doña Justina y Calahorra_, _Los Mirones_, and\r\n_Los Refranes_—all these are of doubtful authenticity. In April\r\n1609, Cervantes took a thought and mended: he joined Fray Alonso de\r\nla Purificación's new Confraternity of the Blessed Sacrament, and in\r\n1610 wrote his sonnet in memory of Diego Hurtado de Mendoza. In 1611 he\r\nentered the Academia Selvaje, founded by that Francisco de Silva whose\r\npraises were sung later in the _Viaje del Parnaso_, and he prepared\r\nthat unique compound of fact and fancy, the rarest humour and the\r\nmost curious experience—his twelve _Novelas Exemplares_, which were\r\nlicensed on August 8, 1612, and appeared in 1613.\r\n\r\nThese short tales were written at long intervals of time, as the\r\ninternal evidence shows. In the forty-seventh chapter of _Don Quixote_\r\nthere is mention by name of _Rinconete y Cortadillo_, a picaresque\r\nstory of extraordinary brilliancy and point included among the\r\n_Exemplary Novels_; and a companion piece is the _Coloquio de los\r\nPerros_, no less a masterpiece in little. Monipodio, master of a school\r\nfor thieves; his pious jackal, Ganchuelo, who never steals on Friday;\r\nthe tipsy Pipota, who reels as she lights her votive candle—these are\r\ntriumphs in the art of portraiture. Not even Sancho Panza is wittier in\r\nreflection than the dog Berganza, who reviews his many masters in the\r\nlight of humorous criticism. No less distinguished is the presentation,\r\nin _El Casamiento Engañoso_, of the picaroons Campuzano and Estefanía\r\nde Caicedo; and as an exercise in fantastic transcription of mania the\r\n_Licenciado Vidriera_ lags not behind _Don Quixote_. So striking is the\r\nresemblance that some have held the Licentiate for the first sketch of\r\nthe Knight; but an attentive reading shows that he was not conceived\r\ntill after _Don Quixote_ was in print. In 1814, Agustín García Arrieta\r\nincluded _La Tía fingida_ (The Mock Aunt) among Cervantes' novels, and,\r\nin a more complete form, it now finds place in all editions. Admirable\r\nas the story is, the circumstance of its late appearance throws doubt\r\non its authenticity; yet who but Cervantes could have written it?\r\nPerhaps the surest sign of his success is afforded by the quality and\r\nnumber of his northern imitators.\r\n\r\n  \"_The land that cast out Philip and his God\r\n  Grew gladly subject where Cervantes trod._\"\r\n\r\nDespite assertions to the contrary, his _Gitanilla_ is no original\r\nconception, for the character of his gipsy, Preciosa, is developed from\r\nthat of Tarsiana in the _Apolonio_; yet from Cervantes' rendering of\r\nher, which\r\n\r\n  \"_Gave the glad watchword of the gipsies' life,\r\n  Where fear took hope and grief took joy to wife,_\"\r\n\r\nand from his tale entitled _La Fuerza de la Sangre_, Middleton's\r\n_Spanish Gipsy_ derives. From Cervantes, too, Weber takes his opera\r\n_Preciosa_, and from Cervantes comes Hugo's _Esmeralda_. In _Las dos\r\nDoncellas_ Fletcher, who had already used _Don Quixote_ in the _Knight\r\nof the Burning Pestle_, finds the root of _Love's Pilgrimage_; from _El\r\nCasamiento Engañoso_ he takes his _Rule a Wife and Have a Wife_; and\r\nfrom _La Señora Cornelia_ he borrows his _Chances_. And, as Fielding\r\nhad rejoiced to own his debt to Cervantes, so Sir Walter has confessed\r\nthat \"the _Novelas_ of that author had first inspired him with the\r\nambition of excelling in fiction.\"\r\n\r\nThe next performance shows Cervantes tempting fate as a poet. His\r\n_Viaje del Parnaso_ (1614) was suggested by the _Viaggio di Parnaso_\r\n(1582) of the Perugian, Cesare Caporali, and is, in effect, a rhymed\r\nreview of contemporary poets. Verse is scarcely a lucky medium for\r\nCervantic irony, and Cervantes was the least critical of men. His poem\r\nis interesting for its autobiographic touches, but it degenerates\r\ninto a mere stream of eulogy, and when he ventures on an attack he\r\nrarely delivers it with force or point. He thought, perhaps, to put\r\ndown bad poets as he had put down bad prose-writers. But there was\r\nthis difference, that, though admirable in prose, he was not admirable\r\nin verse. In the use of the first weapon he is an expert; in the\r\npractice of the second he is a clever amateur. Cervantes satirising\r\nin prose and Cervantes satirising in verse are as distinct as Samson\r\nunshorn and Samson with his hair cut. Fortunately he appends a prose\r\npostscript, which reveals him in his finest manner. Nor is this\r\nsurprising. Apollo's letter is dated July 22, 1614; and we know that,\r\ntwo days earlier, Sancho Panza had dictated his famous letter to his\r\nwife Teresa. The master had found himself once more. The sequel to _Don\r\nQuixote_, promised in the Preface to the _Novelas_, was on the road at\r\nlast. Meanwhile he had busied himself with a sonnet to be published\r\nat Naples in Juan Domingo Roncallolo's _Varias Aplicaciones_, with\r\nquatrains for Barrio Ángulo, and stanzas in honour of Santa Teresa.\r\n\r\nMoreover, the success of the _Novelas_ induced him to try the theatre\r\nagain. In 1615 he published his _Ocho Comedias, y ocho Entremeses\r\nnuevos_. The eight set pieces are failures; and when the writer\r\ntries to imitate Lope de Vega, as in the _Laberinto de Amor_, the\r\nfailure is conspicuous. Nor does the introduction of a Saavedra\r\namong the personages of _El Gallardo Español_ save a bad play. But\r\nCervantes believed in his eight _comedias_, as he believed in the\r\neight _entremeses_ which are imitated from Lope de Rueda. These are\r\nsprightly, unpretentious farces, witty in intention and effect,\r\ninteresting in themselves and as realistic pictures of low life seen\r\nand rendered at first hand. Of these farcical pieces one, _Pedro de\r\nUrdemalas_, is even brilliant.\r\n\r\nWhile Cervantes was writing the fifty-ninth chapter of _Don Quixote's\r\nSecond Part_, he learned that a spurious continuation had appeared\r\n(1614) at Tarragona under the name of Alonso Fernández de Avellaneda.\r\nThis has given rise to much angry writing. Avellaneda is doubtless\r\na pseudonym. The King's confessor, Aliaga, has been suspected, on\r\nthe ground that he was once nicknamed Sancho Panza, and that he thus\r\navenged himself: the idea is absurd, and the fact that Avellaneda makes\r\nSancho more offensive and more vulgar than ever puts the theory out of\r\ncourt. Lope de Vega is also accused of being Avellaneda, and the charge\r\nis based on this: that (in a private letter) he once spoke slightingly\r\nof _Don Quixote_. The personal relations between the two greatest\r\nSpanish men of letters were not cordial. Cervantes had ridiculed Lope\r\nin the Prologue to _Don Quixote_, had belittled him as a playwright,\r\nand had shown hostility in other ways. Lope, secure in his high seat,\r\nmade no reply, and in 1612 (in another private letter) he speaks kindly\r\nof Cervantes. \"Cervantophils\" insist upon being too clever by half.\r\nThey first assert that the outward form of Avellaneda's book was an\r\nimitation of _Don Quixote_, and that the intention was \"to pass off\r\nthis spurious Second Part as the true one\"; they then contend that\r\nAvellaneda's was \"a deliberate attempt to spoil the work of Cervantes.\"\r\nThese two statements are mutually destructive: one must necessarily\r\nbe false. It is also argued, first, that Avellaneda's is a worthless\r\nbook; next, that it was written by Lope, the greatest figure, save\r\nCervantes, in Spanish literature. Lope had many jealous enemies, but no\r\ncontemporary hints at such a charge, and no proof is offered in support\r\nof it now. Indeed the notion, first started by Máinez, is generally\r\nabandoned. Other ascriptions, involving Blanco de Paz, Ruiz de Alarcón,\r\nAndrés Pérez, are equally futile. The most plausible conjecture, due\r\nto D. Marcelino Menéndez y Pelayo, is that Avellaneda was a certain\r\nAragonese, Alfonso Lamberto. Lamberto's very obscurity favours this\r\nsurmise. Had Avellaneda been a figure of great importance, he had been\r\nunmasked by Cervantes himself, who assuredly was no coward.\r\n\r\nWe owe to Avellaneda a clever, brutal, cynical, amusing book, which\r\nis still reprinted. Nor is this our only debt to him: he put an end\r\nto Cervantes' dawdling and procured the publication of the second\r\n_Don Quixote_. Cervantes left it doubtful if he meant to write the\r\nsequel; he even seems to invite another to undertake it. Nine years had\r\npassed, during which Cervantes made no sign. Avellaneda, with an eye to\r\nprofit, wrote his continuation in good faith, and his insolent Preface\r\nis explained by his rage at seeing the bread taken out of his mouth\r\nwhen the true sequel was announced in the Preface to the _Novelas_.\r\nHad not his intrusion stung Cervantes to the quick, the second _Don\r\nQuixote_ might have met the fate of the second _Galatea_—promised for\r\nthirty years and never finished. As it is, the hurried close of the\r\nSecond Part is below the writer's common level, as when he rages at\r\nAvellaneda, and wishes that the latter's book be \"cast into the lowest\r\npit of hell.\" But this is its single fault, which, for the rest, is\r\nonly found in the last fourteen chapters. The previous fifty-eight\r\nform an almost impeccable masterpiece. As an achievement in style, the\r\nSecond excels the First Part. The parody of chivalresque books is less\r\ninsistent, the interest is larger, the variety of episode is ampler,\r\nthe spirit more subtly comic, the new characters are more convincing,\r\nthe manner is more urbane, more assured. Cervantes' First Part was an\r\nexperiment in which he himself but half believed; in the Second he\r\nshows the certainty of an accepted master, confident of his intention\r\nand his popularity. So his career closed in a blaze of triumph. He had\r\nother works in hand: a play to be called _El Engaño á los Ojos_, the\r\n_Semanas del Jardín_, the _Famoso Bernardo_, and the eternal second\r\n_Galatea_. These last three he promises in the Preface to _Los Trabajos\r\nde Persiles y Sigismunda_ (1617), a posthumous volume \"that dares\r\nto vie with Heliodorus,\" and was to be \"the best or worst book ever\r\nwritten in our tongue.\" Ambitious in aim and in manner, the _Persiles_\r\nhas failed to interest, for all its adventures and scapes. Yet it\r\ncontains perhaps the finest, and certainly the most pathetic passage\r\nthat Cervantes ever penned—the noble dedication to his patron, the\r\nConde de Lemos, signed upon April 19, 1616. In the last grip of dropsy,\r\nhe gaily quotes from a _romance_ remembered from long ago:—\r\n\r\n  \"_Puesto ya el pié en el estribo_\"—\r\n\r\n\"One foot already in the stirrup.\" With these words he smilingly\r\nconfronts fate, and makes him ready for the last post down the Valley\r\nof the Shadow. He died on April 23, nominally on the same day as\r\nShakespeare, whose death is dated by an unreformed calendar. They were\r\nbrethren in their lives and afterwards. Montesquieu, in the _Lettres\r\nPersanes_, makes Rica say of the Spaniards that \"le seul de leurs\r\nlivres qui soit bon est celui qui a fait voir la ridicule de tous les\r\nautres.\" If he meant that _Don Quixote_ was the one Spanish book which\r\nhas found acceptance all the world over, he spoke with equal truth and\r\npoint. A single author at once national and universal is as much as any\r\nliterature can hope to boast.\r\n\r\nIn his own day Cervantes was shone down by the ample, varied,\r\nmagnificent gifts of LOPE FÉLIX DE VEGA CARPIO (1562-1635): a very\r\n\"prodigy of nature,\" as his rival confesses. A prodigy he was from his\r\ncradle. At the age of five he lisped in numbers, and, unable to write,\r\nwould bribe his schoolmates with a share of his breakfast to take down\r\nverses at his dictation. He came of noble highland blood, his father,\r\nFélix de Vega, and his mother, Francisca Fernández, being natives of\r\nCarriedo. Born in Madrid, he was there educated at the Jesuit Colegio\r\nImperial, of which he was the wonder. All the accomplishments were his:\r\nstill a child, he filled his copy-books with verses, sang, danced,\r\nhandled the foil like a trained sworder. His father, a poet of some\r\naccomplishment, died early, and Lope forthwith determined to see the\r\nworld. With his comrade, Hernando Muñoz, he ran away from school. The\r\npair reached Astorga, and turned back to Segovia, where, being short\r\nof money, they tried to sell a chain to a jeweller, who, suspecting\r\nsomething to be wrong, informed the local Dogberry. The adventurous\r\ncouple were sent home in charge of the police. Lope's earliest\r\nsurviving play, _El verdadero Amante_, written in his thirteenth year,\r\nis included in the fourteenth volume of his theatre, printed in 1620.\r\nNicolás de los Ríos, one of the best actor-managers of his time,\r\nwas proud to play in it later; and, crude as it is in phrasing, it\r\nmanifests an astonishing dramatic gift.\r\n\r\nThe chronology of Lope's youth is perplexing, and the events of this\r\ntime are, as a rule, wrongly given by his biographers, even including\r\nthat admirable scholar, Cayetano Alberto de la Barrera y Leirado,\r\nwhose _Nueva Biografía_ is almost above praise. In a poetic epistle\r\nto Luis de Haro, Lope asserts that he fought at Terceira against\r\nthe Portuguese: \"in my third lustre\"—_en tres lustros de mi edad\r\nprimera_: and Ticknor is puzzled to reconcile this with facts. It\r\ncannot be done. Lope was fifteen in 1577, and the expedition to the\r\nAzores occurred in 1582. The obvious explanation is that Lope was in\r\nhis fourth lustre, but that, as _cuatro_ would break the rhythm of\r\nthe line, he wrote _tres_ instead. Some little licence is admitted in\r\nverse, and literal interpreters are peculiarly liable to error. At\r\nthe same time, it should be said that Lope is coquettish as regards\r\nhis age. Thus, he says that he was a child at the time of the Armada,\r\nbeing really twenty-six; and that he wrote the _Dragontea_ in early\r\nyouth, when, in fact, he was thirty-five. This little vanity has led to\r\nendless confusion. It is commonly stated that, on Lope's return from\r\nthe Azores, he entered the household of Gerónimo Manrique, Bishop of\r\nÁvila, who sent him to Alcalá de Henares. That Lope studied at Alcalá\r\nis certain; but undergraduates then matriculated earlier than they do\r\nnow. When Lope's first campaign ended he was twenty-one, and therefore\r\ntoo old for college. He was a Bachelor before ever he went to the\r\nwars. The love-affair, recounted in his _Dorotea_, is commonly said to\r\nhave prevented his taking orders at Alcalá: in truth, he never saw the\r\nlady till he came back from the Azores! He became private secretary to\r\nAntonio Álvarez de Toledo y Beaumont, fifth Duque de Alba, and grandson\r\nof the great soldier; but the date cannot be given precisely. As far\r\nback as 1572 he had translated Claudian's _Rape of Proserpine_ into\r\nCastilian verse, and we have already seen him joined with Cervantes in\r\npenning complimentary sonnets for Padilla and López Maldonado (1584).\r\nIt may be that, while in Alba's service, he wrote the poems printed in\r\nPedro de Moncayo's _Flor de varios romances_ (1589).\r\n\r\nThe history of these years is obscure. It is usually asserted that,\r\nwhile in Alba's service, about the year 1584-5, Lope married, and\r\nthat he was soon afterwards exiled to Valencia, whence he set out\r\nfor Lisbon to join the Invincible Armada. This does not square with\r\nLope's statement in the Dedication of _Querer la propia Desdicha_ to\r\nClaudio Conde. There he alleges that Conde helped him out of prison\r\nin Madrid, a service repaid by his helping Conde out of the Serranos\r\nprison at Valencia, and he goes on to say that \"before the first down\r\nwas on their cheeks\" they went to Lisbon to embark on the Armada. He\r\nnowhere alleges that they started from Valencia, or that the journey\r\nfollowed the banishment. In an eclogue to the same Conde, Lope avers\r\nthat he joined the Armada to escape from Filis (otherwise Dorotea),\r\nand he adds:—\"Who could have thought that, returning from the war,\r\nI should find a sweet wife?\" The question would be pointless if Lope\r\nwere already married. Moreover, Barrera's theory that the intrigue\r\nwith Dorotea ended in 1584 is disproved by the fact that the _Dorotea_\r\ncontains allusions to the Conde de Melgar's marriage, which, as we know\r\nfrom Cabrera, took place in 1587. What is certain is that Lope went\r\naboard the _San Juan_, and that during the Armada expedition he used\r\nhis manuscript verses in Filis's praise for gun-wads.\r\n\r\nHe was a first-class fighting-man, and played his part in the combats\r\nup the Channel, where his brother was killed beside him during an\r\nencounter between the _San Juan_ and eight Dutch vessels. Disaster\r\nnever quenched his spirit nor stayed his pen; for, when what was left\r\nof the defeated Armada returned to Cádiz, he landed with the greater\r\npart of his _Hermosura de Angélica_—eleven thousand verses, written\r\nbetween storm and battle, in continuation of the _Orlando Furioso_.\r\nFirst published in 1602, the _Angélica_ comes short of Ariosto's epic\r\nnobility, and is unrelieved by the Italian's touch of ironic fantasy.\r\nNor can it be called successful even as a sequel: its very wealth\r\nof invention, its redundant episodes and innumerable digressions,\r\ncontribute to its failure. But the verse is singularly brilliant and\r\neffective, while the skill with which the writer handles proper names\r\nis almost Miltonic.\r\n\r\nReturned to Spain, Lope composed his pastoral novel, the _Arcadia_,\r\nwhich, however, remained unpublished till 1598. Ticknor believed it \"to\r\nhave been written almost immediately\" after Cervantes' _Galatea_: this\r\ncannot be, for the _Arcadia_ refers to the death of Santa Cruz, which\r\noccurred in 1588, and it discusses in the conventional manner Alba's\r\nlove-affairs of 1589-90. The _Arcadia_, where Lope figures as Belardo,\r\nand Alba as Amfriso, makes no pretence to be a transcript of manners\r\nor life, and it is intolerably prolix withal. Yet it goes beyond its\r\nfellows by virtue of its vivid landscapes, its graceful, flowing verse,\r\nand a certain rich, poetic, Latinized prose, here used by Lope with\r\nas much artistry as he showed in his management of the more familiar\r\nkind in the _Dorotea_. Its popularity is proved by the publication\r\nof fifteen editions in its author's lifetime. About the year 1590 he\r\nmarried Isabel de Urbina, a distant connection of Cervantes' mother,\r\nand daughter of Felipe II.'s King-at-Arms. Hereupon followed a duel,\r\nwherein Lope wounded his adversary, and, earlier escapades being raked\r\nup, he was banished the capital. He spent some time in Valencia, a\r\nconsiderable literary centre; but in 1594 he signed the manuscript of\r\nhis play, _El Maestro de danzar_, at Tormes, Alba's estate, whence\r\nit is inferred that he was once more in the Duke's service. A new\r\nlove-affair with Antonia Trillo de Armenta brought legal troubles upon\r\nhim in 1596. His wife apparently died in 1597.\r\n\r\nThe first considerable work printed with Lope's name upon the\r\ntitle-page was his _Dragontea_ (1598), an epic poem in ten cantos\r\non the last cruise and death of Francis Drake. We naturally love to\r\nthink of the mighty seaman as the patriot, the chiefest of Britannia's\r\nbulwarks, as he figures in Mr. Newbolt's spirited ballad:—\r\n\r\n  \"_Drake lies in his hammock till the great Armadas come ...\r\n  Slung atween the round shot, listenin' for the drum ...\r\n  Call him on the deep sea, call him up the Sound,\r\n    Call him when ye sail to meet the foe;\r\n  Where the old trade's plyin' and the old flag flyin',\r\n    They shall find him 'ware an' waking, as they found him long ago._\"\r\n\r\nOdd to say, though, Lope has been censured for not viewing Drake\r\nthrough English Protestant spectacles. Seeing that he was a good\r\nCatholic Spaniard whom Drake had drummed up the Channel, it had been\r\ncurious if the _Dragontea_ were other than it is: a savage denunciation\r\nof that Babylonian Dragon, that son of the devil whose piracies had\r\ntormented Spain during thirty years. The _Dragontea_ fails not because\r\nof its national spirit, which is wholly admirable, but because of its\r\nexcessive emphasis and its abuse of allegory. Its author scarcely\r\nintended it for great poetry; but, as a patriotic screed, it fulfilled\r\nits purpose, and, when reprinted, it drew an approving sonnet from\r\nCervantes.\r\n\r\nThe _Dragontea_ was written while Lope was in the household of the\r\nMarqués de Malpica, whence he passed as secretary to the lettered\r\nMarqués de Sarriá, best known as Conde de Lemos, and as Cervantes'\r\npatron. In 1599 he published his devout and graceful poem, _San\r\nIsidro_, in honour of Madrid's patron saint. Popular in subject and\r\nexecution, the _San Isidro_ enabled him to repeat in verse the triumph\r\nwhich he had achieved with the prose of the _Arcadia_. From this day\r\nforward he was the admitted pontiff of Spanish literature. His marriage\r\nwith Juana de Guardo probably dates from the year 1600. An example of\r\nLope's art in manipulating the sonnet-form is afforded by Longfellow's\r\nEnglishing of _The Brook_:—\r\n\r\n  \"_Laugh of the mountain! lyre of bird and tree!\r\n    Pomp of the meadow! mirror of the morn!\r\n    The soul of April, unto whom are born\r\n  The rose and jessamine, leaps wild in thee!\r\n  Although where'er thy devious current strays,\r\n    The lap of earth with gold and silver teems,\r\n    To me thy clear proceeding brighter seems\r\n  Than golden sands that charm each shepherd's gaze.\r\n  How without guile thy bosom, all transparent\r\n    As the pure crystal, lets the curious eye\r\n    Thy secrets scan, thy smooth, round pebbles count!\r\n  How, without malice murmuring, glides thy current!\r\n    O sweet simplicity of days gone by!\r\n    Thou shun'st the haunts of man, to dwell in limpid fount!_\"\r\n\r\nTwo hundred sonnets in Lope's _Rimas_ are thought to have been issued\r\nseparately in 1602: in any case, they were published that year at the\r\nend of a reprint of the _Angélica_. They include much of the writer's\r\nsincerest work, earnest in feeling, skilful and even distinguished as\r\nart. One sonnet of great beauty—_To the Tomb of Teodora Urbina_—has\r\nled Ticknor into an amusing error often reproduced. He cites from it\r\na line upon the \"heavenly likeness of my Belisa,\" notes that this\r\nname is an anagram of Isabel (Lope's first wife), and pronounces the\r\nperformance a lament for the poet's mother-in-law. The Latin epitaph\r\nwhich follows it contains a line,—\r\n\r\n  \"_Exactis nondum complevit mensibus annum_,\"—\r\n\r\nshowing that the supposed mother-in-law died in her first year.\r\nManifestly the sonnet refers to the writer's daughter, and, as always\r\nhappens when Lope speaks from his paternal heart, is instinct with a\r\npassionate tenderness.\r\n\r\nTo 1604 belong the five prose books of the _Peregrino en su patria_,\r\na prose romance of Pánfilo's adventures by sea and land, partly\r\nexperienced and partly contrived; but it is most interesting for the\r\nfour _autos_ which it includes, and for its bibliographical list\r\nof two hundred and thirty plays already written by the author. His\r\nquenchless ambition had led him to rival Ariosto in the _Angélica_:\r\nin the twenty cantos of his _Jerusalén Conquistada_ he dares no less\r\ngreatly by challenging Tasso. Written in 1605, the _Jerusalén_\r\nwas withheld till 1609. Styled a \"tragic epic\" by its creator, it\r\nis no more than a fluent historico-narrative poem, overlaid with\r\nembellishments of somewhat cheap and obvious design. In 1612 appeared\r\nthe _Four Soliloquies of Lope de Vega Carpio_: _his lament and tears\r\nwhile kneeling before a crucifix begging pardon for his sins._ These\r\nfour sets of _redondillas_ with their prose commentaries were amplified\r\nto seven when republished (1626) under the pseudonym of Gabriel\r\nPadecopeo, an obvious anagram. The deaths of Lope's wife and of his son\r\nCarlos inspired the _Pastores de Belén_, a sacred pastoral of supreme\r\nsimplicity, truth, and beauty—as Spanish as Spain herself—which\r\ncontains one of the sweetest numbers in Castilian. The Virgin lulls\r\nthe Divine Child with a song in Verstegan's manner, which Ticknor has\r\nrendered to this effect:—\r\n\r\n  \"_Holy angels and blest,\r\n    Through those palms as ye sweep\r\n  Hold their branches at rest,\r\n    For my babe is asleep._\r\n\r\n  _And ye Bethlehem palm-trees,\r\n    As stormy winds rush\r\n  In tempest and fury,\r\n    Your angry noise hush;\r\n  More gently, more gently,\r\n    Restrain your wild sweep;\r\n  Hold your branches at rest,\r\n    My babe is asleep._\r\n\r\n  _My babe all divine,\r\n    With earth's sorrows oppressed,\r\n  Seeks in slumber an instant\r\n    His grievings to rest;\r\n  He slumbers, he slumbers,\r\n    Oh, hush, then, and keep\r\n  Your branches all still,\r\n    My babe is asleep!_\r\n\r\n  _Cold blasts wheel about him,\r\n    A rigorous storm,\r\n  And ye see how, in vain,\r\n    I would shelter his form.\r\n  Holy angels and blest,\r\n    As above me ye sweep,\r\n  Hold these branches at rest,\r\n    My babe is asleep!_\"\r\n\r\nLope lived a life of gallantry, and troubled his wife's last years\r\nby his intrigue with María de Luján. This lady bore him the gifted\r\nson, Lope Félix, who was drowned at sea, and the daughter Marcela,\r\nwhose admirable verses, written after her profession in the Convent of\r\nBarefoot Trinitarians, proclaim her kinship with the great enchanter.\r\nA relapsing, carnal sinner, Lope was more weak than bad: his rare\r\nintellectual gifts, his renown, his overwhelming temperament, his\r\nseductive address, his imperial presence, led him into temptation. Amid\r\nhis follies and sins he preserved a touching faith in the invisible,\r\nand his devotion was always ardent. Upon the death of his wife in\r\n1612 or later, he turned to religion with characteristic impetuosity,\r\nwas ordained priest, and said his first mass in 1614 at the Carmelite\r\nChurch in Madrid. It was an ill-advised move. Ticknor, indeed, speaks\r\nof a \"Lope, no longer at an age to be deluded by his passions\"; but\r\nno such Lope is known to history. While a Familiar of the Inquisition\r\nthe true Lope wrote love-letters for the loose-living Duque de Sessa,\r\ntill at last his confessor threatened to deny him absolution. Nor is\r\nthis all: his intrigue with Marta de Nevares Santoyo, wife of Roque\r\nHernández de Ayala, was notorious. The pious Cervantes publicly\r\njeered at the fallen priest's \"continuous and virtuous occupation,\"\r\nforgetting his own coarse pranks with Ana de Rojas; and Góngora hounded\r\nhis master down with a copy of venomous verses passed from hand to\r\nhand. Those who wish to study the abasement of an august spirit may\r\ndo so in the _Últimos Amores de Lope de Vega Carpio_, forty-eight\r\nletters published by José Ibero Ribas y Canfranc.[21] If they judge by\r\nthe standard of Lope's time, they will deal gently with a miracle of\r\ngenius, unchaste but not licentious; like that old Dumas, who, in the\r\nmatters of gaiety, energy, and strength is his nearest modern compeer.\r\nHis sin was yet to find him out. He vanquished every enemy: the child\r\nof his old age vanquished him.\r\n\r\nDevotion and love-affairs served not to stay his pen. His _Triunfo\r\nde la fe en el Japón_ (1618) is interesting as an example of Lope's\r\npractice in the school of historical prose, stately, devout, and\r\nelegant. In honour of Isidore, beatified and then canonised, he\r\npresided at the poetic jousts of 1620 and 1622, witnessing the\r\ntriumph of his son, Félix Lope; standing literary god-father to the\r\nboyish Calderón; declaiming, in the character of Tomé Burguillos,\r\nthe inimitable verse which hit between wind and water. Perhaps Lope\r\nwas never happier than in this opportunity of speaking his own witty\r\nlines before the multitude. His noble person, his facility, his urbane\r\ncondescension, his incomparable voice, which thrilled even clowns\r\nwhen he intoned his mass—all these gave him the stage as his own\r\npossession. Heretofore the common man had only read him: once seen and\r\nheard, Lope ruled Castilian literature as Napoleon ruled France.\r\n\r\nHis _Filomena_ (1621) contains a poetic defence of himself (the\r\nNightingale) against Pedro de Torres Rámila (the Thrush), who, in 1617,\r\nhad violently attacked Lope in his _Spongia_, which seems to have\r\nvanished, and is only known by extracts embodied in the _Expostulatio\r\nSpongiæ_, written by Francisco López de Aguilar Coutiño under the\r\nname of Julius Columbarius. Polemics apart, the chief interest of\r\nthe _Filomena_ volume lies in its short prose story, _Las Fortunas\r\nde Diana_, an experiment which the author repeated in the three\r\ntales—_La Desdicha por la honra_, _La prudente Venganza_, and _Guzmán\r\nel Bravo_—appended to his _Circe_ (1624), a poem, in three cantos, on\r\nUlysses' adventures. The five cantos of the _Triunfos divinos_ are\r\npious exercises in the Petrarchan manner, with forty-four sonnets given\r\nas a postscript. Five cantos go to make up the _Corona Trágica_ (1627),\r\na religious epic with Mary Stuart for heroine. Lope has been absurdly\r\ncensured for styling Queen Elizabeth a Jezebel and an Athaliah, and for\r\nregarding Mary as a Catholic martyr. This criticism implies a strange\r\nintellectual confusion; as though a veteran of the Armada could be\r\nexpected to write in the spirit of a Clapham Evangelical! Religious\r\nsquabbles apart, he had an old score to settle; for—\r\n\r\n  \"_Where are the galleons of Spain?_\"\r\n\r\nwas a question which troubled good Spaniards as much as it delighted\r\nMr. Dobson. Dedicated to Pope Urban VIII., the poem won for its author\r\nthe Cross of St. John and the title of Doctor of Divinity. Three years\r\nlater he issued his _Laurel de Apolo_, a cloying eulogy on some three\r\nhundred poets, as remarkable for its omissions as for its flattering\r\nof nonentities. The _Dorotea_ (1632), a prose play fashioned after\r\nthe model of the _Celestina_, was one of Lope's favourites, and is\r\ninteresting, not merely for its graceful, familiar style, retouched\r\nand polished for over thirty years, but as a piece of self-revelation.\r\nThe _Rimas del licenciado Tomé de Burguillos_ (1634) closes with the\r\nmock-heroic _Gatomaquia_, a vigorous and brilliant travesty of the\r\nItalian epics, replenished with such gay wit as suffices to keep it\r\nsweet for all time.\r\n\r\nLope de Vega's career was drawing to its end. The elopement, with a\r\ncourt gallant, of his daughter, Antonia Clara, broke him utterly.[22]\r\nHe sank into melancholy, sought to expiate by lashing himself with the\r\ndiscipline till the walls of his room were flecked with his blood.\r\nWithal he wrote to the very end. On August 23, 1635, he composed his\r\nlast poem, _El Siglo de Oro_. Four days later he was dead. Madrid\r\nfollowed him to his grave, and the long procession turned from the\r\ndirect path to pass before the window of the convent where his\r\ndaughter, Sor Marcela, was a nun. A hundred and fifty-three Spanish\r\nauthors bewailed the Phœnix in the _Fama póstuma_, and fifty Italians\r\npublished their laments at Venice under the title of _Essequie\r\npoetiche_.\r\n\r\nLope left no achievement unattempted: the epic, Homeric or Italian,\r\nthe pastoral, the romantic novel, poems narrative and historical,\r\ncountless eclogues, epistles, not to speak of short tales, of\r\nsonnets innumerable, of verses dashed off on the least occasion. His\r\nvoluminous private letters, full of wit and malice and risky anecdote,\r\nare as brilliant and amusing as they are unedifying. It is sometimes\r\nalleged that he deliberately capped Cervantes' work; and, as instances\r\nin this sort, we are bid to note that the _Galatea_ was followed by\r\n_Dorotea_, the _Viaje del Parnaso_ by the _Laurel de Apolo_. In the\r\nfirst place, exclusive \"spheres of influence\" are not recognised in\r\nliterature; in the second, the observation is pointless. The _Galatea_\r\nis a pastoral novel, the _Dorotea_ is not; the first was published in\r\n1585, the second in 1632. Again, the _Viaje del Parnaso_ appeared in\r\n1614, the _Laurel de Apolo_ in 1630. The first model was the _Canto\r\ndel Turia_ of Gil Polo. It would be as reasonable—that is to say, it\r\nwould be the height of unreason—to argue that _Persiles y Sigismunda_\r\nwas an attempt to cap the _Peregrino en su patria_. The truth is, that\r\nLope followed every one who made a hit: Heliodorus, Petrarch, Ariosto,\r\nTasso. A frank success spurred him to rivalry, and the difficulty of\r\nrepeating it was for him a fresh stimulus. Obstacles existed to be\r\nvanquished. He was ever ready to accept a challenge; hence such a\r\ndexterous _tour de force_ as his famous _Sonnet on a Sonnet_, imitated\r\nin a well-known _rondeau_ by Voiture, translated again and again, and\r\nby none more successfully than by Mr. Gibson:—\r\n\r\n  \"_To write a sonnet doth Juana press me,\r\n    I've never found me in such stress and pain;\r\n    A sonnet numbers fourteen lines 'tis plain,\r\n  And three are gone ere I can say, God bless me!\r\n  I thought that spinning rhymes might sore oppress me,\r\n    Yet here I'm midway in the last quatrain;\r\n    And, if the foremost tercet I can gain,\r\n  The quatrains need not any more distress me.\r\n  To the first tercet I have got at last,\r\n    And travel through it with such right good-will,\r\n    That with this line I've finished it, I ween.\r\n  I'm in the second now, and see how fast\r\n    The thirteenth line comes tripping from my quill—\r\n    Hurrah, 'tis done! Count if there be fourteen!_\"\r\n\r\nThe foregoing list of Lope's exploits in literature, curtailed as\r\nit is, suffices for fame; but it would not suffice to explain that\r\nmatchless popularity which led to the publication—suppressed by the\r\nInquisition in 1647—of a creed beginning thus:—\"I believe in Lope de\r\nVega the Almighty, the Poet of heaven and earth.\" So far we have but\r\nreached the threshold of his temple. His unique renown is based upon\r\nthe fact that he created a national theatre, that he did for Spain what\r\nShakespeare did for England. Gómez Manrique and Encina led the way\r\ngropingly; Torres Naharro, though he bettered all that had been done,\r\nlived out of Spain; Lope de Rueda and Timoneda brought the drama to the\r\npeople; Artieda, Virués, Argensola, and Cervantes tore their passions\r\nto tatters in conformity with their own strange precepts, which the\r\nlast-named would have enforced by a literary dictatorship. Moreover,\r\nArgensola and the three veterans of Lepanto wrote to please themselves:\r\nLope invented a new art to enchant mankind. And he succeeded beyond all\r\nambition. Nor does he once take on the airs of philosopher or pedant:\r\nrather, in a spirit of self-mockery, he makes his confession in the\r\n_Arte Nuevo de hacer Comedias_ (New Mode of Playwriting), which his\r\nEnglish biographer, Lord Holland, translates in this wise:—\r\n\r\n  \"_Who writes by rule must please himself alone,\r\n  Be damn'd without remorse, and die unknown.\r\n  Such force has habit—for the untaught fools,\r\n  Trusting their own, despise the ancient rules.\r\n  Yet true it is, I too have written plays.\r\n  The wiser few, who judge with skill, might praise;\r\n  But when I see how show (and nonsense) draws\r\n  The crowds and—more than all—the fair's applause,\r\n  Who still are forward with indulgent rage\r\n  To sanction every master of the stage,\r\n  I, doom'd to write, the public taste to hit,\r\n  Resume the barbarous taste 'twas vain to quit:\r\n  I lock up every rule before I write,\r\n  Plautus and Terence drive from out my sight, ...\r\n  To vulgar standards then I square my play,\r\n  Writing at ease; for, since the public pay,\r\n  'Tis just, methinks, we by their compass steer,\r\n  And write the nonsense that they love to hear._\"\r\n\r\nThus Lope in his bantering avowal of 1609. Yet what takes the form of\r\nan apology is in truth a vaunt; for it was Lope's task to tear off\r\nthe academic swaddling-bands of his predecessors, and to enrich his\r\ncountry with a drama of her own. Nay, he did far more: by his single\r\neffort he dowered her with an entire dramatic literature. The very\r\nbulk of his production savours of the fabulous. In 1603 he had already\r\nwritten over two hundred plays; in 1609 the number was four hundred\r\nand eighty-three; in 1620 he confesses to nine hundred; in 1624 he\r\nreaches one thousand and seventy; and in 1632 the total amounted to\r\none thousand five hundred. According to Montalbán, editor of the\r\n_Fama póstuma_, the grand total, omitting _entremeses_, should be one\r\nthousand eight hundred plays, and over four hundred _autos_. Of these\r\nabout four hundred plays and forty _autos_ survive. If we take the\r\nfigures as they stand, Lope de Vega wrote more than all the Elizabethan\r\ndramatists put together. Small wonder that Charles Fox was staggered\r\nwhen his nephew, Lord Holland, spoke of Lope's twenty million lines.\r\nFacility and excellence are rarely found together, yet Lope combined\r\nboth qualities in such high degree that any one with enough Spanish to\r\nread him need never pass a dull moment so long as he lives.\r\n\r\nHazlitt protests against the story which tells that Lope wrote a play\r\nbefore breakfast, and in truth it rests on no good authority. But it is\r\nhistory that, not once, but an hundred times, he wrote a whole piece\r\nwithin twenty-four hours. Working in these conditions, he must needs\r\nhave the faults inseparable from haste. He repeats his thought with\r\nsmall variation; he utilises old solutions for a dramatic _impasse_;\r\nand his phrase is too often more vigorous than finished. But it is\r\nnot as a master of artistic detail that Lope's countrymen place him\r\nbeside Cervantes. First, and last, and always, he is a great creative\r\ngenius. He incarnates the national spirit, adapts popular poetry to\r\ndramatic effects, substitutes characters for abstractions, and, in\r\na word, expresses the genius of a people. It is true that he rarely\r\nfinds a perfect form for his utterance, that he constantly approaches\r\nperfection without quite attaining unto it, that his dramatic instinct\r\nexceeds his literary execution. Yet he survives as the creator of\r\nan original form. His successors improved upon him in the matter of\r\npolish, yet not one of them made an essential departure of his own, not\r\none invented a radical variant upon Lope's method. Tirso de Molina may\r\nexceed him in force of conception, as Ruiz de Alarcón outshines him in\r\nethical significance, in exposition of character; yet Tirso and Alarcón\r\nare but developing the doctrine laid down by the master in _El Castigo\r\nsin Venganza_—the lesson of truth, realism, fidelity to the actual\r\nusages of the time. Tirso, Alarcón, and Calderón are a most brilliant\r\nprogeny; but the father of them all is the unrivalled Lope. He seized\r\nupon what germs of good existed in Torres Naharro, Rueda, and Cueva;\r\nbut his debt to them was small, and he would have found his way without\r\nthem. Without Lope we should have had no Tirso, no Calderón.[23]\r\n\r\nProducing as he produced, much of his work may be considered as\r\nimprovisation; even so, he takes place as the first improvisatore in\r\nthe world, and compels recognition as, so to say, \"a natural force\r\nlet loose.\" He imagined on a Napoleonic scale; he contrived incident\r\nwith such ease and force and persuasiveness as make the most of\r\nhis followers seem poor indeed; and his ingenuity of diversion is\r\nmiraculously fresh after nearly three hundred years. His gift never\r\nfails him, whether he deal with historical tragedy, with the heroic\r\nlegend, with the presentation of picaresque life, or with the play\r\nof intrigue and manners—the _comedia de capa y espada_. This last,\r\n\"the cloak and sword play\" is as much his personal invention as is\r\nthe _gracioso_—the comic character—as is the _enredo_—the maze of\r\nplot—as is the \"point of honour,\" as is the feminine interest in\r\nhis best work. Hitherto the woman had been allotted a secondary, an\r\nincidental part, ludicrous in the _entremés_, sentimental in the set\r\npiece. Lope, the expert in gallantry, in manners, in observation,\r\nplaced her in her true setting, as an ideal, as the mainspring of\r\ndramatic motive and of chivalrous conduct. He professed an abstract\r\napproval of the classic models; but his natural impulse was too strong\r\nfor him. An imitator he could not be, save in so far as he, in his own\r\nphrase, \"imitated men's actions, and reproduced the manners of the\r\nage.\" He laid down rules which in practice he flouted; for he realised\r\nthat the business of the scene is to hold an audience, is to interest,\r\nto surprise, to move. He could not thump a pulpit in an empty hall: he\r\nperceived that a play which fails to attract is—for the playwright's\r\npurpose—a bad play. He can be read with infinite pleasure; yet he\r\nrarely attempted drama for the closet. Emotion in action was his aim,\r\nand he achieved it with a certainty which places him among the greatest\r\ngods of the stage.\r\n\r\nIt is difficult to fix upon the period when Lope's dramatic genius was\r\naccepted by his public: 1592 seems a likely date. He took no interest\r\nin publishing his plays, though _El Perseguido_ was issued by a Lisbon\r\npirate so early as 1603. Eight volumes of his theatre were in print\r\nbefore he was induced in 1617 to authorise an edition which was called\r\nthe _Ninth Part_, and after 1625 he printed no more dramatic pieces,\r\ndespite the fact that he produced them more abundantly than ever. We\r\nmay, perhaps, assume that the best of his work has reached us. Among\r\nthe finest of his earlier efforts is justly placed _El Acero de Madrid_\r\n(The Madrid Steel), from which Molière has borrowed the _Médecin\r\nmalgré lui_, and the opening scene, as Ticknor renders it, admirably\r\nillustrates Lope's power of interesting his audience from the very\r\noutset by a situation which explains itself. Lisardo, with his friend\r\nRiselo, enamoured of Belisa, awaits the latter at the church-door, and,\r\njust as Riselo declares that he will wait no more, Belisa enters with\r\nher pious aunt, Teodora, as _dueña_:—\r\n\r\nTeodora.\r\n\r\n  \"_Show more of gentleness and modesty;\r\n  Of gentleness in walking quietly,\r\n  Of modesty in looking only down\r\n  Upon the earth you tread._\r\n\r\nBelisa.\r\n                            _'Tis what I do._\r\n\r\nTeodora.\r\n\r\n  _What? When you're looking straight towards that man?_\r\n\r\nBelisa.\r\n\r\n  _Did you not bid me look upon the earth?\r\n  And what is he but just a bit of it?_\r\n\r\nTeodora.\r\n\r\n  _I said the earth whereon you tread, my niece._\r\n\r\nBelisa.\r\n\r\n  _But that whereon I tread is hidden quite\r\n  With my own petticoat and walking-dress._\r\n\r\nTeodora.\r\n\r\n  _Words such as these become no well-bred maid.\r\n  But, by your mother's blessed memory,\r\n  I'll put an end to all your pretty tricks;—\r\n  What? You look back at him again._\r\n\r\nBelisa.\r\n\r\n                                    _Who? I?_\r\n\r\nTeodora.\r\n\r\n  _Yes, you;—and make him secret signs besides._\r\n\r\nBelisa.\r\n\r\n  _Not I! 'Tis only that you troubled me\r\n  With teasing questions and perverse replies,\r\n  So that I stumbled and looked round to see\r\n  Who would prevent my fall._\r\n\r\nRiselo (to Lisardo).\r\n\r\n                            _She falls again.\r\n  Be quick and help her._\r\n\r\nLisardo (to Belisa).\r\n\r\n                        _Pardon me, lady,\r\n  And forgive my glove._\r\n\r\nTeodora.\r\n\r\n                        _Who ever saw the like?_\r\n\r\nBelisa.\r\n\r\n  _I thank you, sir; you saved me from a fall._\r\n\r\nLisardo.\r\n\r\n  _An angel, lady, might have fallen so,\r\n  Or stars that shine with heaven's own blessed light._\r\n\r\nTeodora.\r\n\r\n  _I, too, can fall; but 'tis upon your trick.\r\n  Good gentleman, farewell to you!_\r\n\r\nLisardo.\r\n\r\n                                  _Madam,\r\n  Your servant._ (_Heaven save us from such spleen!_)\r\n\r\nTeodora.\r\n\r\n  _A pretty fall you made of it; and now I hope\r\n  You'll be content, since they assisted you._\r\n\r\nBelisa.\r\n\r\n  _And you no less content, since now you have\r\n  The means to tease me for a week to come._\r\n\r\nTeodora.\r\n\r\n  _But why again do you turn back your head?_\r\n\r\nBelisa.\r\n\r\n  _Why, sure you think it wise and wary\r\n  To notice well the place I stumbled at,\r\n  Lest I should stumble there when next I pass._\r\n\r\nTeodora.\r\n\r\n  _Mischief befall you!

You saw him help me;\r\n  And would you have me fail to thank him for it?_\r\n\r\nTeodora.\r\n\r\n  _Go to! Come home! come home!_\"\r\n\r\nThis is a fair specimen, even in its sober English dress, of Lope's\r\ngallant dialogue and of his consummate skill in gripping his subject.\r\nNo playwright has ever shown a more infallible tact, a more assured\r\nconfidence in his own resources. He never attempts to puzzle his\r\naudience with a dull acrostic: complicated as his plot may be (and\r\nhe loves to introduce a double intrigue when the chance proffers),\r\nhe exposes it at the outset with an obvious solution; but not one in\r\ntwenty can guess precisely how the solution is to be attained. And,\r\ntill the last moment, his contagious, reckless gaiety, his touches of\r\nperplexing irony, his vigilant invention, help to thrill and vivify the\r\ninterest.\r\n\r\nYet has he all the defects of his facility. In an indifferent mood,\r\nbesieged by managers for more and more plays, he would set forth upon a\r\npiece, not knowing what was to be its action, would indulge in a triple\r\nplot of baffling complexity eked out by incredible episodes. Even his\r\ningenuity failed to find escape from such unprepared situations. Still\r\nit is fair to say that such instances are rare with him: time upon time\r\nhis dramatic instinct saved him where a less notable inventor must have\r\nsuccumbed. He could create character; he was an artist in construction;\r\nhe knew what could, and could not, be done upon the stage. Like Dumas,\r\nhe needed but \"four trestles, four boards, two actors, and a passion\";\r\nand, at his best, he rises to the greatest occasion. In a single\r\nscene, in an act entire, you shall read him with wonder and delight for\r\nhis force and truth and certainty. Yet the trail of carelessness is\r\nupon his last acts, and his conscience sometimes sleeps ere his curtain\r\nfalls. The fact that he thought more of a listener than of ten readers\r\ncomes home to a constant student. Lope had few theories as to style,\r\nand he rarely aims at sheer beauty of expression, at simple felicity of\r\nphrase. Hence his very cleverness grows wearisome at last. But, after\r\nall, he must be judged by the true historic standard: his achievement\r\nmust be compared with what preceded, not with what came after him.\r\nTirso de Molina and Calderón and Moreto grew the flower from Lope's\r\nseed. He took the farce as Lope de Rueda left it, and transformed\r\nits hard fun by his humane and sparkling wit. He inherited the cold\r\nmediæval morality, and touched it into life by the breath of devout\r\nimagination. He re-shaped the crude collection of massacres which\r\nVirués mistook for tragedy, and produced effects of dread and horror\r\nwith an artistry of his own devising, a selection, a conscience, a\r\ndelicate vigour all unknown until he came. And for the _comedia de capa\r\ny espada_, it springs direct from his own cunning brain, unsuggested\r\nand even unimagined by any forerunner.\r\n\r\nIt were hopeless to analyse any part of the immense theatre which he\r\nbequeathed to the world. But among his best tragedies may be cited\r\n_El Castigo sin Venganza_, with its dramatic rendering of the Duke of\r\nFerrara sentencing his adulterous wife and incestuous son to death.\r\nAmong his historic dramas none surpasses _El Mejor Alcalde el Rey_,\r\nwith its presentation of the model Spanish heroine, Elvira; of the\r\nfeudal baron, Tello; and of the King as the buckler of his people,\r\nthe strong man doing justice in high places: a most typical piece\r\nof character, congenial to the aristocratic democracy of Spain. A\r\nmore morbid version of the same monarchical sentiment is given in\r\n_La Estrella de Sevilla_, the argument of which is brief enough for\r\nquotation. King Sancho _el Bravo_ falls enamoured of Busto Tavera's\r\nsister, Estrella, betrothed to Sancho Ortiz de las Roelas. Having\r\nvainly striven to win over Busto, the King follows the advice of Arias,\r\ncorrupts her slave, enters Estrella's room, is there discovered,\r\nis challenged by Busto, and escapes with a sound skin. The slave,\r\nconfessing her share in the scheme, is killed by the innocent\r\nheroine's brother. Meanwhile, the King determines upon Busto's death,\r\nsummons Sancho Ortiz, and bids him slay a certain criminal guilty of\r\n_lèse-majesté_. Herewith the King offers Sancho a guarantee against\r\nconsequences. Sancho Ortiz destroys it, saying that he asks for nothing\r\nbetter than the King's word, and ends by begging the sovereign to\r\ngrant him the hand of an unnamed lady. To this the King accedes, and\r\nhe hands Sancho Ortiz a paper containing the name of the doomed man.\r\nAfter much hesitation and self-torment, Sancho Ortiz resolves to do his\r\nduty to his King, slays Busto, is seized, refuses to explain, undergoes\r\nsentence of death, and is finally pardoned by King Sancho, who avows\r\nhis own guilt, and endeavours to promote the marriage between Sancho\r\nOrtiz and Estrella. For an obvious reason they refuse, and the curtain\r\nfalls upon Estrella's determination to get herself to a nunnery.\r\n\r\nThus baldly told, the story resembles a thousand others; under Lope's\r\nhand it throbs with life and movement and emotion. His dialogue is\r\nswift and strong and appropriate, whether he personifies the blind\r\npassion of the King, the incorruptibility of Busto, the feudal ideal of\r\nSancho Ortiz, or the strength and sweetness of Estrella. Of dialogue he\r\nis the first and best master on the Spanish stage: more choice, if less\r\npowerful, than Tirso; more natural, if less altisonant, than Calderón.\r\nThe dramatic use of certain metrical forms persisted as he sanctioned\r\nit: the _décimas_ for laments, the _romance_ for exposition, the _lira_\r\nfor heroic declamation, the sonnet to mark time, the _redondilla_ for\r\nlove-passages. His lightness of touch, his gaiety and resourcefulness\r\nare exampled in _La Dama Melindrosa_ (The Languishing Lady), as good\r\na cloak-and-sword play as even Lope ever wrote. His gift of sombre\r\nconception is to be seen in _Dineros son Calidad_ (Money is Rank),\r\nwhere his contrivance of the King of Naples' statue addressing Octavio\r\nis the nearest possible approach to Tirso's figures of the Commander\r\nand of Don Juan.\r\n\r\nWhether or not Tirso took the idea from Lope cannot well be decided;\r\nbut if he did so, he was no worse than the rest of the world. For\r\nages dramatists of all nations have found Lope de Vega \"good to steal\r\nfrom,\" and in many forms he has diverted other countries than the\r\nSpains. Alexandre Hardy is said by tradition to have exploited him\r\nvigorously, and probably we should find the imitations among Hardy's\r\nlost plays. Jean Mairet is reputed to have borrowed generously, and\r\nan undoubted follower is Jean Rotrou, many of whose pieces—from the\r\nearly _Occasions perdues_ and _La belle Alfrède_ to his last effort,\r\n_Don Lope de Cardonne_—are boldly annexed from Lope. D'Ouville, in\r\n_Les Morts vivants_ and in _Aimer sans savoir qui_, exploited Lope\r\nto the profit of French playgoers. It is a rash conjecture which\r\nidentifies the _Wild Gallant_ with the _Galán escarmentado_, inasmuch\r\nas the latter play is even still \"inedited,\" and could scarcely have\r\nreached Dryden; but it cannot be doubted that when the sources of our\r\nRestoration drama are traced out, Lope will be found to rank with\r\nCalderón, and Moreto, and Rojas Zorrilla.\r\n\r\nYet his chief glory must, like Burns's, be ever local. Cervantes, for\r\nall his national savour, might conceivably belong to any country; but\r\nLope de Vega is the incarnate Spains. His gaiety, his suppleness, his\r\nadroit construction, his affluence, his realism, are eminently Spanish\r\nin their strength; his heedless form, his journalistic emphasis, his\r\ninequality, his occasional incoherence, his anxiety to please at any\r\ncost, are eminently Spanish in their weakness. He lacks the universal\r\nnote of Shakespeare, being chiefly for his own time and not for all the\r\nages. Shakespeare, however, stands alone in literature. It is no small\r\npraise to say that Lope follows him on a lower plane. There are two\r\ngreat creators in the European drama: Shakespeare founds the English\r\ntheatre, Lope de Vega the Spanish, each interpreting the genius of his\r\npeople with unmatched supremacy. And unto both there came a period of\r\neclipse. That very generation which Lope had bewildered, dominated, and\r\ncharmed by his fantasy turned to the worship of Calderón. Nor did he\r\nprofit by the romantic movement headed by the Schlegels and by Tieck.\r\nFor them, as for Goethe, Spanish literature was incarnated by Cervantes\r\nand by Calderón. The immense bulk of Lope's production, the rarity of\r\nhis editions, the absence of any representative translation, caused\r\nhim to be overlooked. To two men—to Agustín Durán in Spain and to\r\nGrillparzer in Germany—he owes his revival;[24] and, in more modest\r\ndegree, Lord Holland and George Henry Lewes have furthered his due\r\nrecognition. The present tendency is, perhaps, to overrate him, and to\r\nsubstitute uncritical adoration for uncritical neglect. Yet he deserves\r\nthe fame which grows from day to day; for if he have bequeathed us\r\nlittle that is exquisite in art—as _Los Pastores de Belén_—the world\r\nis his debtor for a new and singular form of dramatic utterance. In\r\nso much he is not only a great executant in the romantic drama, a\r\nvirtuoso of unexcelled resource and brilliancy. He is something still\r\ngreater: the typical representative of his race, the founder of a\r\ngreat and comprehensive _genre_. The genius of Cervantes was universal\r\nand unique; Lope's was unique but national. Cervantes had the rarer\r\nand more perfect endowment. But they are immortals both; and, paradox\r\nthough it may seem, a second Cervantes is a likelier miracle than a\r\nsecond Lope de Vega.\r\n\r\n                   *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIn 1599, the year following upon the issue of Lope's _Dragontea_,\r\nthe picaresque tradition of _Lazarillo de Tormes_ was revived by the\r\nSevillan MATEO ALEMÁN (fl. ? 1550-1609) in the First Part of his\r\n_Atalaya de la Vida humana_: _Vida del Pícaro Guzmán de Alfarache_. The\r\nalternative title—the _Watch-Tower of Human Life_—was rejected by the\r\nreading public, which, to the author's annoyance, insisted on speaking\r\nof the _Pícaro_ or _Rogue_. Little is known of Alemán's life, save that\r\nhe took his Bachelor's degree at Seville in 1565. He is conjectured\r\nto have visited Italy, perhaps as a soldier, is found serving in\r\nthe Treasury so early as 1568, and, after twenty years, left the\r\nKing's service as poor as he entered it. A passage in his _Ortografía\r\nCastellana_, published at Mexico in 1609, is thought to show that he\r\nwas a printer; but this is surmise. That he emigrated to America seems\r\ncertain; but the date of his death is unknown.\r\n\r\nHis _Guzmán de Alfarache_ is an amplified version of Lázaro's\r\nadventures; and, though he adds little to the first conception, his\r\nabundant episode and interminable moralisings hit the general taste.\r\nTwenty-six editions, amounting to some fifty thousand copies, appeared\r\nwithin six years of the first publication: not even _Don Quixote_\r\nhad such a vogue. Nor was it less fortunate abroad. In 1623 it was\r\nadmirably translated by James Mabbe in a version for which Ben Jonson\r\nwrote a copy of verses in praise of\r\n\r\n        \"_this Spanish Proteus; who, though writ\r\n  But in one tongue, was form'd with the world's wit;\r\n  And hath the noblest mark of a good book,\r\n  That an ill man dares not securely look\r\n  Upon it, but will loathe, or let it pass,\r\n  As a deformed face doth a true glass._\"\r\n\r\nIt is curious to note that Mabbe's rendering appeared in the same year\r\nas Shakespeare's First Folio, to which Ben Jonson also contributed; but\r\nwhile the _Rogue_ reached its fourth edition in 1656, the third edition\r\nof the First Folio was not printed till 1664.\r\n\r\nThe pragmatical cant and the moral reflections which weary us as much\r\nas they wearied the French translator, Le Sage, were clearly to the\r\nliking of Ben Jonson and his contemporaries. Guzmán's experiences\r\nas boots at an inn, as a thief in Madrid, as a soldier at Genoa, as\r\na jester at Rome, are told with a certain impudent spirit; but the\r\n\"moral intention\" of the author obtrudes itself with an insistence\r\nthat defeats its own object, and the subsidiary tales of Dorido and\r\nClorinia, of Osmín and Daraja—a device imitated in _Don Quixote_—are\r\ndigressions of neither interest nor relevancy. The popularity of the\r\nbook was so great as to induce imitation. While Alemán was busied with\r\nhis devout _Vida de San Antonio de Padua_ (1604), or perhaps with\r\nhis fragmentary versions of Horace, a spurious sequel was published\r\n(1601) by a Valencian lawyer, Juan Martí, who took the pseudonym of\r\nMateo Luján de Sayavedra. Martí had somehow managed to see Alemán's\r\nmanuscript of the Second Part, and, in so much, his trick was far baser\r\nthan Avellaneda's. Alemán's self-control under greater provocation\r\ncontrasts most favourably with Cervantes' petulance. In the true\r\nSecond Part he good-humouredly acknowledges his competitor's \"great\r\nlearning, his nimble wit, his deep judgment, his pleasant conceits\";\r\nand he adds that \"his discourses throughout are of that quality and\r\ncondition that I do much envy them, and should be proud that they were\r\nmine.\" And having thus put his rival in the wrong, Alemán proceeds to\r\nintroduce among his personages a Sayavedra who would pass himself off\r\nas a native of Seville:—\"but all were lies that he told me; for he was\r\nof Valencia, whose name, for some just causes, I conceal.\" Sayavedra\r\nfigures as Guzmán's bonnet and jackal till he ends by suicide, and he\r\nis made to supply whatever entertainment the book contains. Far below\r\n_Lazarillo de Tormes_ in caustic observation and in humour, _Guzmán de\r\nAlfarache_ is a rapid and easy study of blackguardism, forcible and\r\ndiverting despite its unctuousness, and written in admirable prose.\r\n\r\nSo much cannot be claimed for the _Pícara Justina_ (1605) of Francisco\r\nLópez de Úbeda, who is commonly identified as the Dominican, ANDRÉS\r\nPÉREZ, author of a _Vida de San Raymundo de Peñafort_ and of other\r\npious works. His _Pícara Justina_ was long in maturing, for he\r\nconfesses to having \"augmented after the publication of the admired\r\nwork of the _pícaro_,\" Guzmán; whom Justina, in fact, ends by marrying.\r\nPérez has acquired a notorious reputation for lubricity; yet it is\r\nhard to say how he came by it, since he is no more indecent than most\r\npicaresque writers. He lacks wit and invention; his style, the most\r\nmannered of his time, is full of pedantic turns, unnatural inversions\r\nand verbal eccentricities wherewith he seeks to cover his bald\r\nimagination and his witless narrative. But his freaks of vocabulary,\r\nhis extravagant provincialisms, lend him a certain philological\r\nimportance which may account for the reprints of his volume. It may\r\nbe added that, in his _Pícara_, Pérez anticipates Cervantes' trifling\r\nfind of the _versos de cabo roto_; and, from the angry attack upon the\r\nmonk in the _Viaje del Parnaso_, it seems safe to infer that Cervantes\r\nresented being forestalled by one who had probably read the _Quixote_\r\nin manuscript.[25]\r\n\r\nA more successful attempt in the same kind is the _Relaciones de la\r\nVida del Escudero Marcos de Obregón_ by Vicente Espinel (?1544-1634),\r\na poor student at Salamanca, a soldier in Italy and the Low Countries,\r\nand finally a priest in Madrid. His _Diversas Rimas_ (1591) are\r\ncorrect, spirited exercises, in new metrical forms, including versions\r\nof Horace which, in the last century, gave rise to a bitter polemic\r\nbetween Iriarte and López de Sedano. Moreover, Espinel is said to\r\nhave added a fifth string to the guitar. But it is by his _Marcos\r\nde Obregón_ (1618) that he is best known. Voltaire alleged that _Gil\r\nBlas_ was a mere translation of _Marcos de Obregón_, but the only\r\nfoundation for this pretty exercise in fancy is that Le Sage borrowed\r\na few incidents from Espinel, as he borrowed from Vélez de Guevara\r\nand others. The book is excellent of its kind, brilliantly phrased,\r\nfull of ingenious contrivance, of witty observation, and free from the\r\nlong digressions which disfigure _Guzmán de Alfarache_. Espinel knew\r\nhow to build a story and how to tell it graphically, and his artistic\r\nselection of incident makes the reading of his _Marcos_ a pleasure even\r\nafter three centuries.\r\n\r\nAs the picaresque novel was to supply the substance of Charles Sorel's\r\n_Francion_ and of Paul Scarron's _Roman Comique_, so the _Almahide_\r\nof Mlle. de Scudéry and the _Zayde_ of Mme. de Lafayette find their\r\nroot in the Hispano-Mauresque historical novel. This invention we owe\r\nto GINÉS PÉREZ DE HITA of Murcia (fl. 1604), a soldier who served in\r\nthe expedition against the Moriscos during the Alpujarra rising. His\r\n_Guerras civiles de Granada_ was published in two parts—the first\r\nin 1595, and the second, which is distinctly inferior, in 1604. The\r\nauthor's pretence of translating from the Arabic of a supposititious\r\nIbn Hamin is refuted by the fact that the authority of Spanish\r\nchroniclers is continually cited as final, and the fact that the\r\npoint of view is conspicuously Christian. Some tittle of history\r\nthere is in Pérez de Hita, but the value of his work lies in his own\r\nfantastic transcription of life in Granada during the last weeks before\r\nits surrender. Challenges, duels between Moorish knights, personal\r\nencounters with Christian champions, harem intrigues, assassinations,\r\njousts, sports, and festivals held while the enemy is without the\r\ngates—such circumstances as these make the texture of the story,\r\nwhich is written with extraordinary grace and ease. Archæologists join\r\nwith Arabists in censuring Pérez de Hita's detail, and historians\r\nare scandalised by his disdain for facts; yet to most of us he is\r\nmore Moorish than the Moors, and his vivid rendering of a great and\r\nancient civilisation on the eve of ruin is more complete and impressive\r\nthan any that a pile of literal chronicles can yield. As a literary\r\nartist he is better in his first part than in his second, where he is\r\nembarrassed by a knowledge of events in which he bore a part; yet, even\r\nso, he never fails to interest, and the beauty of his style would alone\r\nsuffice for a reputation. A story of doubtful authority represents\r\nScott as saying that, if he had met with the _Guerras civiles de\r\nGranada_ in earlier days, he would have chosen Spain as the scene of a\r\nWaverley Novel. Whatever be the truth of this report, we cannot doubt\r\nthat Sir Walter must have read with delight his predecessor's brilliant\r\nperformance in the province of the historical novel.\r\n\r\nThe _Romancero General_, published at Madrid in 1600, and amplified\r\nin the reprint of 1604, is often described as a collection of old\r\nballads, made in continuation of the anthologies arranged by Nucio\r\nand Nájera. Old, as applied to _romances_, has a relative meaning;\r\nbut even in the lowest sense the word can scarcely be used of the\r\nsongs in the _Romancero General_, which is very largely made up of the\r\nwork of contemporary poets. Another famous volume of lyrics is Pedro\r\nEspinosa's _Flores de Poetas ilustres de España_ (1605), which includes\r\nspecimens of Camões, Barahona de Soto, Lope de Vega, Góngora, Quevedo,\r\nSalas Barbadillo, and others of less account. Of minor singers, such\r\nas López Maldonado, the friend of Cervantes and of Lope, there were\r\ntoo many; but Maldonado's _Cancionero_ (1586) reveals a combination\r\nof sincerity and technical excellence which distinguishes him from\r\nthe crowd of fluent versifiers typified by Pedro de Padilla. Devout\r\nsongs, as simple as they are beautiful, are found in the numbers of\r\nJuan López de Úbeda and of Francisco de Ocaña, who may be studied in\r\ntheir respective _cancioneros_ (1588, 1604), or—much more briefly, and\r\nperhaps to better purpose—in Rivadeneyra's _Romancero y Cancionero\r\nsagrados_. The chief of these pious minstrels was JOSÉ DE VALDIVIELSO\r\n(?1560-1636), the author of a long poem entitled _Vida, Excelencias\r\ny Muerte del gloriosísimo Patriarca San José_; but it is neither by\r\nthis tedious sacred epic nor by his twelve _autos_ that Valdivielso\r\nshould be judged. His lyrical gift, scarcely less sweet and sincere\r\nthan Lope's own, is best manifested in his _Romancero Espiritual_, with\r\nits _romances_ to Our Lady, its pious _villancicos_ on Christ's birth,\r\nwhich anticipate the mingled devotion and familiarity of Herrick's\r\n_Noble Numbers_.\r\n\r\nANTONIO PÉREZ (1540-1611), once secretary to Felipe II., and in all\r\nprobability the King's rival in love, figures here as a letter-writer\r\nof the highest merit. No Spaniard of his age surpasses him in\r\nclearness, vigour, and variety. Whether he attempt the vein of high\r\ngallantry, the flattery of \"noble patrons,\" the terrorising of an\r\nenemy by hints and innuendos, his phrase is always a model of correct\r\nand spirited expression. In a graver manner are his _Relaciones_ and\r\nhis _Memorial del hecho de su causa_, which combine the dignity of a\r\nstatesman with the ingenuity of an attorney. But in all circumstances\r\nPérez never fails to interest by the happy novelty of his thought,\r\nthe weighty sententiousness of his aphorisms, and by his unblushing\r\nrevelation of baseness and cupidity.\r\n\r\nTo this period belongs also the _Centón Epistolario_, a series of a\r\nhundred letters purporting to be written by Fernán Gómez de Cibdareal,\r\nphysician at Juan II.'s court. It is obviously modelled upon the\r\n_Crónica_ of Juan II.'s reign, and the imitation goes so far that, when\r\nthe chronicler makes a blunder, the supposed letter-writer follows him.\r\nThe _Centón Epistolario_ is now admitted to be a literary forgery, due,\r\nit is believed, to Gil González de Ávila, who wrote nothing of equal\r\nexcellence under his own name. In these circumstances the _Centón_\r\nloses all historic value, and what was once cited as a monument of old\r\nprose must now be considered as a clever mystification—perhaps the\r\nmost perfect of its kind.\r\n\r\nContemporary with Cervantes and Lope de Vega was the greatest of all\r\nSpanish historians, JUAN DE MARIANA (1537-1624). The natural son\r\nof a canon of Talavera, Mariana distinguished himself at Alcalá de\r\nHenares, was brought under the notice of Diego Láinez, General of the\r\nJesuits, and joined the order, whose importance was growing daily. At\r\ntwenty-four Mariana was appointed professor of theology at the great\r\nJesuit College in Rome, whence he passed to Sicily and Paris. In\r\n1574 he returned to Spain, and was settled in the Society's house at\r\nToledo. He was appointed to examine into the charges made by Léon de\r\nCastro against Arias Montano, whose Polyglot Bible appeared at Antwerp\r\nin 1569-72. Montano was accused of adulterating the Hebrew text, and\r\namong the Jesuits the impression of his trickery was general. After a\r\ncareful examination, extending over two years, Mariana pronounced in\r\nMontano's favour. In 1599 there appeared his treatise entitled _De\r\nRege_, with official sanction by his superiors. No Spaniard raised his\r\nvoice against the book; but its sixth chapter, which laid it down that\r\nkings may be put to death in certain circumstances, created a storm\r\nabroad. It was sought to prove that, if Mariana had never written,\r\nRavaillac would not have assassinated Henri IV.; and, eleven years\r\nafter publication, Mariana's book was publicly burned by the hangman.\r\nHis seven Latin treatises, published at Köln in 1609, do not concern\r\nus here; but they must be mentioned, since two of the essays—one on\r\nimmortality, the other on currency questions—led to the writer's\r\nimprisonment.\r\n\r\nThe main work of Mariana's lifetime was his _Historia de España_,\r\nwritten, as he says, to let Europe know what Spain had accomplished. It\r\nwas not unnatural that, with a foreign audience in view, Mariana should\r\naddress it in Latin; hence his first twenty books were published in\r\nthat language (1592). But he bethought him of his own country, and, in\r\na happy hour, became his own translator. His Castilian version (1601)\r\nalmost amounts to a new work; for, in translating, he cut, amplified,\r\nand corrected as he saw fit. And in subsequent editions he continued\r\nto modify and improve. The result is a masterpiece of historic prose.\r\nMariana was not minute in his methods, and his contempt for literal\r\naccuracy comes out in his answer to Lupercio de Argensola, who had\r\npointed out an error in detail:—\"I never pretended to verify each\r\nfact in a history of Spain; if I had, I should never have finished\r\nit.\" This is typical of the man and his method. He makes no pretence\r\nto special research, and he accepts a legend if he honestly can: even\r\nas he follows a common literary convention when he writes speeches in\r\nLivy's manner for his chief personages. But while a score of writers\r\ncared more for accuracy than did Mariana, his work survives not as a\r\nchronicle, but as a brilliant exercise in literature. His learning is\r\nmore than enough to save him from radical blunders; his impartiality\r\nand his patriotism go hand in hand; his character-drawing is firm and\r\nconvincing; and his style, with its faint savour of archaism, is of\r\nunsurpassed dignity and clearness in his narrative. He cared more for\r\nthe spirit than for the letter, and time has justified him. \"The most\r\nremarkable union of picturesque chronicling with sober history that the\r\nworld has ever seen\"—in such words Ticknor gives his verdict; and the\r\npraise is not excessive.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[16] In Felipe II.'s time the normal value of an _escudo de oro_ was\r\n8s. 4-1/4d. The actual exchange value varied between seven and eight\r\nshillings.\r\n\r\n[17] One _real de vellón_ = 34 _maravedís_ = 2 pence, 2 farthings, and\r\n2/3 of a farthing. One _real de plata_ = 2 _reales de vellón_. Unless\r\notherwise stated, a _real_ may be taken to mean a _real de plata_.\r\n\r\n[18] See _The Athenæum_, April 12, April 19, and May 3, 1873.\r\n\r\n[19] See Cristóbal Pérez de Pastor's _Documentos cervantinos hasta\r\nahora inéditos_ (Madrid, 1897), pp. 135-137.\r\n\r\n[20] British Museum Add.

AND CARLOS THE BEWITCHED\r\n\r\n                               1621-1700\r\n\r\n\r\nThe reign of Felipe IV. opens with as fair a promise of achievement\r\nas any in history. At Madrid, in the third and fourth decades of the\r\nseventeenth century, the court of the Grand Monarque was anticipated\r\nand perhaps outdone. We are inclined to think of Felipe as Velázquez\r\nhas presented him, on his \"Cordobese barb, the proud king of\r\nhorses, and the fittest horse for a king\"; and to recall the praise\r\nwhich William Cavendish, first Duke of Newcastle, lavished on his\r\nhorsemanship:—\"The great King of Spain, deceased, did not only love it\r\nand understand it, but was absolutely the best horseman in all Spain.\"\r\nYet is it a mistake to suppose him a mere hunter. Art and letters\r\nwere his constant care; nor was he without a touch of individual\r\naccomplishment. He was not content with instructing his Ministers to\r\nbuy every good picture offered in foreign markets: his own sketches\r\nshow that he had profited by seeing Velázquez at work. It is no small\r\npoint in his favour to have divined at a glance the genius of the\r\nunknown Sevillan master, and to have appointed him—scarcely out of his\r\nteens—court-painter. He likewise collated the artist, Alonso Cano,\r\nto a canonry at Granada, and, when the chapter protested that Cano had\r\nsmall Latin and less Greek, the King's reply was honourable to his\r\ntaste and spirit:—\"With a stroke of the pen I can make canons like\r\nyou by the score; but Alonso Cano is a miracle of God.\" He would even\r\nstay the course of justice to protect an artist. Thus, when Velázquez's\r\nmaster, the half-mad Herrera, was charged with coining, the monarch\r\nintervened with the remark: \"Remember his _St. Hermengild_.\" Music\r\nbecalmed the King's fever, and the plays at the Buen Retiro vied with\r\nthe masques of Whitehall. His antechambers were thronged with men of\r\ngenius. Lope de Vega still survived, his glory waxing daily, though\r\nthe best part of his life's work was finished. Vélez de Guevara was\r\nthe royal chamberlain; Góngora, the court chaplain, hated, envied,\r\nand admired, was the dreaded chief of a combative poetic school; his\r\ndisciple, Villamediana, struck terror with his vitriolic epigrams,\r\nhis rancorous tongue; the aged Mariana represented the best tradition\r\nof Spanish history; Bartolomé de Argensola was official chronicler of\r\nAragón; Tirso de Molina, Ruiz de Alarcón, and Rojas Zorrilla filled the\r\ntheatres with their brilliant and ingenious fancies; the incorruptible\r\nsatirist, Quevedo, was private secretary to the King; the boyish\r\nCalderón was growing into repute and royal favour.\r\n\r\nOf the Aragonese playwright, Lupercio Leonardo de Argensola, we have\r\nalready spoken in a previous chapter. His brother, BARTOLOMÉ LEONARDO\r\nDE ARGENSOLA (1562-1631), took orders, and, through the influence of\r\nthe Duque de Villahermosa, was named rector of the town whence his\r\npatron took his title. His earliest work, the _Conquista de las Islas\r\nMolucas_ (1609), written by order of the Conde de Lemos, is uncritical\r\nin conception and design; but the matter of its primitive, romantic,\r\nand even sentimental legends derives fresh charm from the author's apt\r\nand polished narrative. In 1611 he and his brother accompanied Lemos\r\nto Naples, thereby stirring the anger of Cervantes, who had hoped to\r\nbe among the Viceroy's suite, as appears from a passage in the _Viaje\r\ndel Parnaso_, which roundly insinuates that the Argensolas were a\r\npair of intriguers. The disappointment was natural; yet posterity is\r\neven grateful for it, since a transfer to Naples would certainly have\r\nlost us the second _Don Quixote_. Doubtless the Argensolas, who were\r\nof Italian descent, were better fitted than Cervantes for commerce\r\nwith Italian affairs, and Bartolomé made friends on all sides in\r\nNaples as in Rome. On his brother's death in 1613, he became official\r\nchronicler of Aragón, and, in 1631, published a sequel to _Zurita_,\r\nthe _Anales de Aragón_, which deals so minutely with the events of the\r\nyears 1516-20 as to become wearisome, despite all Argensola's grace of\r\nmanner. The _Rimas_ of the two brothers, published posthumously in 1634\r\nby Lupercio's son, Gabriel Leonardo de Albión, was stamped with the\r\napproval of the dictator, Lope de Vega, who declared that the authors\r\n\"had come from Aragón to reform among our poets the Castilian language,\r\nwhich is suffering from new horrible phrases, more puzzling than\r\nenlightening.\"\r\n\r\nThis is an overstatement of a truth, due to Lope's aversion from\r\nGongorism in all its shapes. Horace is the model of the Argensolas,\r\nwhose renderings of the two odes _Ibam forte via sacra_ and _Beatus\r\nille_ are among the happiest of versions. Their sobriety of thought\r\nis austere, and their classic correctness of diction is in curious\r\ncontrast with the daring innovations of their time. Lupercio has a\r\npolite, humorous fancy, which shows through Mr. Gibson's translation of\r\na well-known sonnet:—\r\n\r\n  \"_I must confess, Don John, on due inspection,\r\n    That dame Elvira's charming red and white,\r\n    Though fair they seem, are only hers by right,\r\n  In that her money purchased their perfection;\r\n  But thou must grant as well, on calm reflection,\r\n    That her sweet lie hath such a lustre bright,\r\n    As fairly puts to shame the paler light,\r\n  And honest beauty of a true complexion!\r\n  And yet no wonder I distracted go\r\n    With such deceit, when 'tis within our ken\r\n    That nature blinds us with the self-same spell;\r\n  For that blue heaven above that charms us so,\r\n    Is neither heaven nor blue! Sad pity then\r\n    That so much beauty is not truth as well._\"\r\n\r\nLupercio's manifold interests in politics, in history, and in the\r\ntheatre left him little time for poetry, and a large proportion of his\r\nverses were destroyed after his death; still, partially represented\r\nas he is, the pretty wit, the pure idiom, and elegant form of his\r\nlyrical pieces vindicate his title to rank among Castilian poets of the\r\nsecond order. As for Bartolomé, he resembles his brother in natural\r\nfaculty, but his fibre is stronger. A hard, dogmatic spirit, a bigot\r\nin his reverence for convention, an idolater of Terence, with a stern,\r\npatriotic hatred of novelties, he was regarded as the standard-bearer\r\nof the anti-Gongorists. Too deeply ingrained a doctrinaire to court\r\npopularity, he was content with the applause of a literary clique, and\r\nhad practically no influence on his age. Yet his precept was valuable,\r\nand his practice, always sound, reaches real excellence in such devout\r\nnumbers as his _Sonnet to Providence_.\r\n\r\nMuch meritorious academic verse is found in the works of other\r\ncontemporary writers, though most rivals lapse into errors of\r\ntaste and faults of expression from which the younger Argensola is\r\nhonourably free. But no great leader is formed in the school of prudent\r\ncorrectness, and by temperament, as well as by training, the Rector\r\nof Villahermosa was unfit to cope with so virile and so combative a\r\ngenius as LUIS DE ARGOTE Y GÓNGORA (1561-1627), the ideal chief of an\r\naggressive movement. Son of Francisco de Argote, Corregidor of Córdoba,\r\nand of Leonora de Góngora, he adopted his mother's name, partly because\r\nof its nobility and partly because of its euphony. In his sixteenth\r\nyear Góngora left his native Córdoba to read law at Salamanca, with a\r\nview to following his father's profession; but his studies were never\r\nserious, and, though he took his bachelor's degree, he gave most of his\r\ntime to fencing and to dancing. To the consternation of his family, he\r\nabandoned law and announced himself as a professional poet. So early\r\nas 1585 Cervantes names him in the _Canto de Calíope_ as a rare and\r\nmatchless genius—_raro ingenio sin segundo_—and, though flattery from\r\nCervantes is too indiscriminating to mean much, the mention at least\r\nimplies that Góngora's promise was already recognised. Few details of\r\nhis career are with us, though rumour tells of platonic love-passages\r\nwith a lady of Valencia, Luisa de Cardona, who finally entered a\r\nconvent in Toledo. His repute as a poet, aided by his mother's\r\nconnection with the ducal house of Almodóvar, won for him a lay canonry\r\nin 1590, and this increase of means enabled him to visit the capital,\r\nwhere he was instantly hailed as a wit and as a brilliant poet. His\r\nfame had hitherto been local; with the publication of his verses in\r\nEspinosa's _Flores de Poetas_. _ilustres_ (1605), it passed through\r\nthe whole of Spain. In the same year, or at latest in 1606, Góngora\r\nwas ordained priest. His private life was always exemplary, and this,\r\ntogether with his natural harshness, perhaps explains his intolerance\r\nfor the foibles of Cervantes and of Lope. When the favourite, the Duque\r\nde Lerma, fell from power, Góngora attached himself to Sandoval, who\r\nnominated him to a small prebend at Toledo. As chaplain to the King,\r\nthe poet's circle of friends enlarged, and his literary influence grew\r\ncorrespondingly. In 1626 he had a cerebral attack, during which the\r\nphysicians of the Queen attended him. The story that he died insane is\r\na gross exaggeration: he lingered on a year, having lost his memory,\r\ndied of apoplexy at Córdoba on May 23, 1627, and is buried in the St.\r\nBartholomew Chapel of the cathedral.\r\n\r\nAn _entremés_ entitled _La destrucción de Troya_, a play called _Las\r\nFirmezas de Isabela_ (written in collaboration with his brother,\r\nJuan de Argote), and a fragment, the _Comedia Venatoria_, remain to\r\nshow that Góngora wrote for the stage. Whether he was ever played\r\nis doubtful, and, in any case, his gift is not dramatic. He was so\r\ncuriously careless of his writings that he never troubled to print or\r\neven to keep copies of them, and a remark which he let fall during his\r\nlast illness goes to show his artistic dissatisfaction:—\"Just as I was\r\nbeginning to know something of the first letters in my alphabet does\r\nGod call me to Himself: His will be done!\" His poems circulated mostly\r\nin manuscript copies, which underwent so many changes that the author\r\noften knew not his own work when it returned to his hands; and, but for\r\nthe piety of Juan López de Vicuña, Góngora might be for us the shadow\r\nof a great name. López de Vicuña spent twenty years in collecting his\r\nscattered verse, which he published in the very year of the poet's\r\ndeath, under the resounding title of _Works in Verse of the Spanish\r\nHomer_. A later and better edition was produced by Gonzalo de Hoces y\r\nCórdoba (1633).\r\n\r\nGóngora began with the lofty ode, as a strict observer of literary\r\ntradition, a reverent imitator of Herrera's heroics. His earliest\r\nessays are not very easy to distinguish from those of his\r\ncontemporaries, save that his tone is nobler and that his execution\r\nis more conscientious. He was a craftsman from the outset, and his\r\ntechnical equipment is singularly complete. So far was he from showing\r\nany freakish originality, that he is open to the reproach of undue\r\ndevotion to his masters. His thought is theirs as much as are his\r\nmethod, his form, his ornament, his ingenuity. An example of his early\r\nstyle is his _Ode to the Armada_, of which we may quote a stanza from\r\nChurton's translation:—\r\n\r\n  \"_O Island, once so Catholic, so strong,\r\n    Fortress of Faith, now Heresy's foul shrine,\r\n  Camp of train'd war, and Wisdom's sacred school;\r\n    The time hath been, such majesty was thine,\r\n  The lustre of thy crown was first in song.\r\n  Now the dull weeds that spring by Stygian pool\r\n  Were fitting wreath for thee. Land of the rule\r\n    Of Arthurs, Edwards, Henries! Where are they?\r\n    Their Mother where, rejoicing in their sway,\r\n  Firm in the strength of Faith? To lasting shame\r\n        Condemn'd, through guilty blame\r\n        Of her who rules thee now.\r\n  O hateful Queen, so hard of heart and brow,\r\n    Wanton by turns, and cruel, fierce, and lewd,\r\n  Thou distaff on the throne, true virtue's bane,\r\n        Wolf-like in every mood,\r\n  May Heaven's just flame on thy false tresses rain!_\"\r\n\r\nThis is excellent of its kind, and among all Herrera's imitators none\r\ncomes so near to him as Góngora in lyrical melody, in fine workmanship,\r\nin a certain clear distinction of utterance. Yet already there are\r\nhints of qualities destined to bear down their owner. Not content with\r\nsimple patriotism, with denunciation of schism and infidelity, Góngora\r\nforeshadows his future self as a very master of gibes and sneers. The\r\nnote of altisonance, already emphatic in Herrera, is still more forced\r\nin the young Córdoban poet, who adds a taste for far-fetched conceits\r\nand extravagant metaphor, assuredly not learned in the Sevillan\r\nschool. Rejecting experiments in the stately ode, he for many years\r\ncontinued his practice in another province of verse, and by rigorous\r\ndiscipline he learned to excel in virtue of his fine simplicity, his\r\ngraceful imagery, and his urbane wit. It should seem that intellectual\r\nself-denial cost him little, for his transformations are among the most\r\ncomplete in literary history. Consider, for instance, the interval\r\nbetween the emphatic dignity of his Armada ode and the charming fancy,\r\nthe distinguished cynicism of _Love in Reason_, as Archdeacon Churton\r\ngives it:—\r\n\r\n  \"_I love thee, but let love be free:\r\n    I do not ask, I would not learn,\r\n  What scores of rival hearts for thee\r\n    Are breaking or in anguish burn._\r\n\r\n  _You die to tell, but leave untold,\r\n    The story of your Red-Cross Knight,\r\n  Who proffer'd mountain-heaps of gold\r\n    If he for you might ride and fight;_\r\n\r\n  _Or how the jolly soldier gay\r\n    Would wear your colours, all and some;\r\n  But you disdain'd their trumpet's bray,\r\n    And would not hear their tuck of drum._\r\n\r\n  _We love; but 'tis the simplest case:\r\n    The faith on which our hands have met\r\n  Is fix'd, as wax on deeds of grace,\r\n    To hold as grace, but not as debt._\r\n\r\n  _For well I wot that nowadays\r\n    Love's conquering bow is soonest bent\r\n  By him whose valiant hand displays\r\n    The largest roll of yearly rent...._\r\n\r\n  _So let us follow in the fashion,\r\n    Let love be gentle, mild, and cool:\r\n  For these are not the days of passion,\r\n    But calculation's sober rule._\r\n\r\n  _Your grace will cheer me like the sun;\r\n    But I can live content in shades.\r\n  Take me: you'll find when all is done,\r\n    Plain truth, and fewer serenades._\"\r\n\r\nEven in translation the humorous amenity is not altogether lost,\r\nthough no version can reproduce the technical perfection of the\r\noriginal. For refined wit and brilliant effect Góngora has seldom\r\nbeen exceeded; yet his fighter pieces failed to bring him the renown\r\nand the high promotion which he expected. He feigned to despise\r\npopularity, declaring that he \"desired to do something that would not\r\nbe for the general\"; but none was keener than he in courting applause\r\non any terms. He would dazzle and surprise, if he could not enchant,\r\nhis public, and forthwith he set to founding the school which bears\r\nthe name of _culteranismo_. We do not know precisely when he first\r\npractised in this vein; but it seems certain that he was anticipated\r\nby a young soldier, Luis de Carrillo y Sotomayor (1583-1610), whose\r\nposthumous verses were published by his brother at Madrid in 1611.\r\nCarrillo had served in Italy, where he came under the spell of Giovanni\r\nBattista Marino, then at the height of his influence; and the _Obras_\r\nof Carrillo contain the first intimations of the new manner. Many of\r\nCarrillo's poems are admirable for their verbal melody, his eclogues\r\nbeing distinguished for simple sincerity of sentiment and expression.\r\nBut these passed almost unnoticed, for Carrillo was only doing well\r\nwhat Lope de Vega was doing better; and in fact it seems likely that\r\nthe merits of the dead soldier-poet were unjustly overlooked by a\r\ngeneration which was content with two editions of his works.\r\n\r\nHe found, however, a passionate admirer in Góngora, who perceived in\r\nsuch work as Carrillo's _Sonnet to the Patience of his Jealous Hope_\r\nthe possibilities of a revolution. When Carrillo writes of \"the proud\r\nsea bathing the blind forehead of the deaf sky,\" he is merely setting\r\ndown a tasteless conceit, which gains nothing by a forced inversion\r\nof phrase; but, as it happened, conceit of this sort was a novelty in\r\nSpain, and Góngora, who had already shown a tendency to preciosity\r\nin Espinosa's collection, resolved to develop Carrillo's innovation.\r\nFew questions are more debated and less understood than this of\r\nGongorism. So good a critic as Karl Hillebrand gives forth this strange\r\nutterance:—\"Not only Italian and German Marinists were imitators of\r\nSpanish Gongorists: even your English Euphuism of Shakespeare's time\r\nhad its origin in the _culteranismo_ of Spain.\" One hardly likes to\r\naccuse Hillebrand of writing nonsense, but he certainly comes near,\r\nperilously near it in this case. Lyly's _Euphues_ was published in\r\n1579, while Góngora was still a student at Salamanca, and Shakespeare\r\ndied nearly twelve years before a line of Góngora's later poems was in\r\nprint. Spanish scholars, indeed, disclaim responsibility for Euphuism\r\nin any shape. They refuse to admit that Lord Berners' or North's\r\ntranslations of Guevara could have produced the effects ascribed to\r\nthem; and they argue with much reason that Gongorism is but the local\r\nform of a disease which attacked all Europe. However that may be, there\r\ncan exist no possible connection between English Euphuism and Spanish\r\nGongorism, save such as comes from a common Italian origin. Gongorism\r\nderives directly from the Marinism propagated in Spain by Carrillo,\r\nthough it must be confessed that Marino's extravagances pale beside\r\nthose of Góngora.\r\n\r\nThis, in fact, is no more than we should expect, for Marino's conceits\r\nwere, so to say, almost natural to him, while Góngora's are a pure\r\neffect of affectation. He wilfully got rid of his natural directness,\r\nand gave himself to cultivating artificial antithesis, violent\r\ninversions of words and phrases, exaggerated metaphors piled upon sense\r\ntropes devoid of meaning. Other poets appealed to the vulgar: he would\r\ncharm the cultivated—_los cultos_. Hence the name _culteranismo_.[26]\r\nAt the same time it is fair to say that he has been blamed for more\r\ncrimes than he ever committed. Ticknor, more than most critics, loses\r\nhis head whenever he mentions Góngora's name, and holds the Spaniard\r\nup to ridicule by printing a literal translation of his more daring\r\nflights. Thus he chooses a passage from the first of the _Soledades_,\r\nand asserts that Góngora sings the praise of \"a maiden so beautiful,\r\nthat she might parch up Norway with her two suns, and bleach Ethiopia\r\nwith her two hands.\" Perhaps no poet that ever lived would survive the\r\ntest of such bald, literal rendering as this, and a much more exact\r\nnotion of the Spanish is afforded by Churton:—\r\n\r\n  \"_Her twin-born sun-bright eyes\r\n  Might turn to summer Norway's wintry skies;\r\n  And the white wonder of her snowy hand\r\n  Blanch with surprise the sons of Ethiopian land._\"\r\n\r\nAnother sonnet on Luis de Bavia's _Historia Pontifical_ is presented\r\nin this fashion:—\"This poem which Bavia has now offered to the world,\r\nif not tied up in numbers, yet is filed down into a good arrangement,\r\nand licked into shape by learning; is a cultivated history, whose\r\ngrey-headed style, though not metrical, is combed out, and robs three\r\npilots of the sacred bark from time, and rescues them from oblivion.\r\nBut the pen that thus immortalises the heavenly turnkeys on the bronzes\r\nof its history is not a pen, but the key of ages. It opens to their\r\nnames, not the gates of failing memory, which stamps shadows on masses\r\nof foam, but those of immortality.\" This, again, is translation of a\r\nkind—of a kind very current among fourth-form boys, and, perpetrated\r\nby such an excellent scholar as Ticknor, is to be accepted as\r\nintentional caricature of the original. Once more the loyal Churton\r\nshall elucidate his author:—\r\n\r\n  \"_This offering to the world by Bavia brought\r\n    Is poesy, by numbers unconfined;\r\n    Such order guides the master's march of mind,\r\n  Such skill refines the rich-drawn ore of thought.\r\n  The style, the matter, gray experience taught,\r\n    Art's rules adorn'd what metre might not bind:\r\n    The tale hath baffled time, that thief unkind,\r\n  And from Oblivion's bonds with toil hath brought_\r\n\r\n  _Three helmsmen of the sacred barque; the pen,\r\n    That so these heavenly wardens doth enhance,—\r\n  No pen, but rather key of Fame's proud dome,\r\n  Opening her everlasting doors to men,—\r\n    Is no poor drudge recording things of chance,\r\n  Which paints her shadowy forms on trembling foam._\"\r\n\r\nStill, when all allowance is made, it must be confessed that Góngora\r\nexcels in hiding his meanings. By many his worst faults were extolled\r\nas beauties, and there was formed a school of disciples who agreed with\r\nLe Sage's Fabrice in holding the master for \"le plus beau génie que\r\nl'Espagne ait jamais produit.\" But Góngora was not to conquer without\r\na struggle. One illustrious writer was an early convert: Cervantes\r\nproclaimed himself an admirer of the _Polifemo_, which is among the\r\nmost difficult of Góngora's works. Pedro de Valencia, one of Spain's\r\nbest humanists, was the first to denounce Góngora's transpositions,\r\nlicentious metaphors, and verbal inventions as manifested in the\r\n_Soledades_ (Solitary Musings), round which the controversy raged\r\nhottest. Within twenty-five years of Góngora's death the first\r\n_Soledad_ found an English translator in the person of Thomas Stanley\r\n(1651), who renders in this fashion:—\r\n\r\n  \"_'Twas now the blooming season of the year,\r\n  And in disguise Europa's ravisher\r\n  (His brow arm'd with a crescent, with such beams\r\n  Encompast as the sun unclouded streams\r\n  The sparkling glory of the zodiac!) led\r\n  His numerous herd along the azure mead.\r\n    When he, whose right to beauty might remove\r\n  The youth of Ida from the cup of Jove,\r\n  Shipwreck't, repuls'd, and absent, did complain\r\n  Of his hard fate and mistress's disdain;\r\n  With such sad sweetness that the winds, and sea,\r\n  In sighs and murmurs kept him company....\r\n  By this time night begun t'ungild the skies,\r\n  Hills from the sea, seas from the hills arise,\r\n  Confusedly unequal; when once more\r\n  The unhappy youth invested in the poor\r\n  Remains of his late shipwreck, through sharp briars\r\n  And dusky shades up the high rock aspires.\r\n  The steep ascent scarce to be reach'd by aid\r\n  Of wings he climbs, less weary than afraid.\r\n    At last he gains the top; so strong and high\r\n  As scaling dreaded not, nor battery,\r\n  An equal judge the difference to decide\r\n  'Twixt the mute load and ever-sounding tide.\r\n  His steps now move secur'd; a glimmering light\r\n  (The Pharos of some cottage) takes his sight._\"\r\n\r\nAnd so on in passages where the darkness grows denser at every line.\r\n\"C'est l'obscurité qui en fait tout le mérite,\" as Fabrice observes\r\nwhen Gil Blas fails to understand his friend's sonnet.\r\n\r\nValencia's protest was followed by another from the Sevillan, Juan de\r\nJáuregui, whose preface to his _Rimas_ (1618) is a literary manifesto\r\nagainst those poems \"which only contain an embellishment of words,\r\nbeing phantoms without soul or body.\" Jáuregui returned to the\r\nattack in his _Discurso poético_ (1623), a more formal and elaborate\r\nindictment of the whole Gongoristic movement. This treatise, of\r\nwhich only one copy is known to exist, has been reprinted with some\r\ncurtailments by Sr. Menéndez y Pelayo in his _Historia de las Ideas\r\nEstéticas en España_. It deserves study no less for its sound doctrine\r\nthan for the admirable style of the writer, whose courtesy of tone\r\nmakes him an exception among the polemists of his time. As Jáuregui\r\nrepresents the opposition of the Seville group, so Manuel Faria y\r\nSousa, the editor of the _Lusiadas_, speaks in the name of Portugal.\r\nFaria y Sousa's theory of poetics is the simplest possible: there is\r\nbut one great poet in the world, and his name is Camões. Faria y Sousa\r\ntransforms the _Lusiadas_ into a dull allegory, where Mars typifies St.\r\nPeter; he writes down Tasso as \"common, trivial, not worth mentioning,\r\npoor in knowledge and invention\"; and, in accordance with these\r\nprinciples, he accuses Góngora of being no allegorist, and protests\r\nthat to rank him with Camões is to compare \"Marsyas to Apollo, a fly to\r\nan eagle.\"\r\n\r\nA more formidable opponent for the Gongorists was Lope de Vega, who\r\nwas himself accused of obscurity and affectation. Bouhours, in his\r\n_Manière de bien penser dans les ouvrages d'esprit_ (1687), tells\r\nthat the Bishop of Belley, Jean-Pierre Camus, meeting Lope in Madrid,\r\ncross-examined him as to the meaning of one of his sonnets. With his\r\nusual good-nature, the poet listened, and \"ayant leû et releû plusieurs\r\nfois son sonnet, avoua sincèrement qu'il ne l'entendoit pas luy\r\nmesme.\" It must have irked his inclination to take the field against\r\nGóngora, for whom he had a strong personal liking:—\"He is a man whom\r\nI must esteem and love, accepting from him with humility what I can\r\nunderstand, and admiring with veneration what I cannot understand.\" Yet\r\nhe loved truth (as he understood it) more than he loved Socrates. \"You\r\ncan make a _culto_ poet in twenty-four hours: a few inversions, four\r\nformulas, six Latin words, or emphatic phrases—and the trick is done,\"\r\nhe writes in his _Respuesta_; and he follows up this plain speaking\r\nwith a burlesque sonnet.\r\n\r\nOf Faria y Sousa and his like, Góngora made small account: he fastened\r\nupon Lope as his victim, pursuing him with unsleeping vindictiveness.\r\nThere is something pathetic in the Dictator's endeavours to soften\r\nhis persecutor's heart. He courts Góngora with polite flatteries in\r\nprint; he dedicates to Góngora the play, _Amor secreto_; he writes\r\nGóngora a private letter to remove a wrong impression given by one\r\nMendoza; he repeats Góngora's witty sayings to his intimates; he makes\r\npersonal overtures to Góngora at literary gatherings; and, if Góngora\r\nbe not positively rude, Lope reports the fact to the Duque de Sessa as\r\na personal triumph:—\"_Está más humano conmigo, que le debo de haber\r\npareçido más ombre de bien de lo que él me ymaginava_\" (\"He is gentler\r\nwith me, and I must seem to him a better fellow than he thought\").\r\nDespite all his ingratiating arts, Lope failed to conciliate his foe,\r\nwho rightly regarded him as the chief obstacle in _culteranismo's_\r\nroad. The relentless riddlemonger lost no opportunity of ridiculing\r\nLope and his court in such a sonnet as the following, which Churton\r\nEnglishes with undisguised gusto:—\r\n\r\n  \"_Dear Geese, whose haunt is where weak waters flow,\r\n    From rude Castilian well-head, cheap supply,\r\n    That keeps your flowery Vega never dry,\r\n  True Vega, smooth, but somewhat flat and low;\r\n  Go; dabble, play, and cackle as ye go\r\n    Down that old stream of gray antiquity;\r\n    And blame the waves of nobler harmony,\r\n  Where birds, whose gentle grace you cannot know,\r\n  Are sailing. Attic wit and Roman skill\r\n    Are theirs; no swans that die in feeble song,\r\n  But nursed to life by Heliconian rill,\r\n    Where Wisdom breathes in Music. Cease your wrong,\r\n  Flock of the troubled pool: your vain endeavour\r\n  Will doom you else to duck and dive for ever._\"\r\n\r\nThe warfare was carried on with singular ferocity, the careless Lope\r\noffering openings at every turn. \"Remove those nineteen castles from\r\nyour shield,\" sang Góngora, deriding Lope's foible in blazoning his\r\ndescent. The amour with Marta Nevares Santoyo was the subject of\r\nobscene lampoons innumerable. A passage in the _Filomena_ volume\r\narabesques the story of Perseus and Andromeda with a complimentary\r\nallusion to an anonymous poet whose name Lope withheld: \"so as not to\r\ncause annoyance.\" Góngora's copy of the _Filomena_ exists with this\r\nholograph annotation on the margin:—\"If you mean yourself, Lopillo,\r\nthen you are an idiot without art or judgment.\" Yet, despite a hundred\r\nbrutal personalities, Lope went his way unheeding, and on Góngora's\r\ndeath he penned a most brilliant sonnet in praise of that \"swan of\r\nBetis,\" for whom his affection had never changed.\r\n\r\nGóngora lived long enough to know that he had triumphed. Tirso de\r\nMolina and Calderón, with most of the younger dramatists, show the\r\n_culto_ influence in many plays; Jáuregui forgot his own principles,\r\nand accepted the new mode; even Lope himself, in passages of his later\r\nwritings, yielded to preciosity. Quevedo began by quoting Epictetus's\r\naphorism:—_Scholasticum esse animal quod ab omnibus irridetur_. And\r\nhe renders the Latin in his own free style:—\"The _culto_ brute is a\r\ngeneral laughing-stock.\" But the \"_culto_ brute\" smiled to see Quevedo\r\ngiven over to _conceptismo_, an affectation not less disastrous in\r\neffect than Góngora's own. Meanwhile enthusiastic champions declared\r\nfor the Córdoban master. Martín de Ángulo y Pulgar published his\r\n_Epístolas satisfactorias_ (1635) in answer to the censures of the\r\nlearned Francisco de Cascales; Pellicer preached the Gongoristic\r\ngospel in his _Lecciones solemnes_ (1630); the _Defence of the Fable\r\nof Pyramus and Thisbe_ fills a quarto by Cristóbal de Salazar Mardones\r\n(1636); García de Salcedo Coronel's huge commentaries (1636-46) are\r\nperhaps, more obscure than anything in his author's text; and, so far\r\naway as Peru, Juan de Espinosa Medrano, Rector of Cuzco, published\r\nan _Apologético en favor de Don Luis de Góngora, Príncipe de los\r\nPoetas Lyricos de España_ (1694). There came a day when, as Salazar y\r\nTorres informs us, the _Polifemo_ and the _Soledades_ were recited on\r\nSpeech-Day by the boys in Jesuit schools.\r\n\r\nIt took Spain a hundred years to rid her veins of the Gongoristic\r\npoison, and Gongorism has now become, in Spain itself, a synonym for\r\nall that is bad in literature. Undoubtedly Góngora did an infinite\r\ndeal of mischief: his tricks of transposition were too easily learned\r\nby those hordes of imitators who see nothing but the obvious, and his\r\nverbal audacities were reproduced by men without a tithe of his taste\r\nand execution. And yet, though it be an unpopular thing to confess,\r\none has a secret sympathy with him in his campaign. Lope de Vega and\r\nCervantes are as unlike as two men may be; but they are twins in their\r\nslapdash methods, in their indifference to exquisiteness of form. Their\r\nfatal facility is common to their brethren: threadbare phrase, accepted\r\nwithout thought and repeated without heed, is, as often as not, the\r\ncurse of the best Spanish work. It was, perhaps, not altogether love\r\nof notoriety which seduced Góngora into Carrillo's ways. He had, as\r\nhis earliest work proves, a sounder method than his fellows and a\r\npurer artistic conscience. No trace of carelessness is visible in his\r\njuvenile poems, written in an obscurity which knew no encouragement. It\r\nis just to believe that his late ambition was not all self-seeking, and\r\nthat he aspired to renew, or rather to enlarge, the poetic diction of\r\nhis country.\r\n\r\nThe aim was excellent, and, if Góngora finally failed, he failed partly\r\nbecause his disciples burlesqued his theories, and partly because he\r\nstrove to make words serve instead of ideas. That his endeavour was\r\npraiseworthy in itself is as certain as that he came at last to regard\r\nhis principles as almost sacred. He doubtless found some pleasure in\r\nastounding and annoying the burgess; but he aimed at something beyond\r\nmaking readers marvel. And though he failed to impose his doctrines\r\npermanently, it is by no means certain that he laboured in vain. If\r\nany later Spaniard has worked in the conscious spirit of the artist,\r\nseeking to avoid the commonplace, to express high thoughts in terms\r\nof beauty—though he knows it not, he owes a debt to Góngora, whose\r\nhatred of the commonplace made Castilian richer. The _Soledades_ and\r\nthe _Polifemo_ have passed away, but many of the words and phrases for\r\nwhich Góngora was censured are now in constant use; and, _culteranismo_\r\napart, Góngora ranks among the best lyrists of his land. Cascales,\r\nwho was at once his friend and his opponent, said that there were two\r\nGóngoras—one an angel of light, the other an angel of darkness; and\r\nthe saying was true in so far as it implied that in all circumstances\r\nhis air of distinction never quits him. Still the earlier Góngora is\r\nthe better, and before we leave him we should quote, as an example of\r\nthat first happy manner, inimitable in its grace and humour, Churton's\r\nnot too unsuccessful version of _The Country Bachelor's Complaint_:—\r\n\r\n  \"_Time was, ere Love play'd tricks with me,\r\n    I lived at ease, a simple squire,\r\n  And sang my praise-song, fancy free,\r\n    At matins in the village quire...._\r\n\r\n  _I rambled by the mountain side,\r\n    Down sylvan glades where streamlets pass\r\n  Unnumber'd, glancing as they glide\r\n    Like crystal serpents through the grass...._\r\n\r\n  _And there the state I ruled from far,\r\n    And bade the winds to blow for me,\r\n  In succour to our ships of war,\r\n    That plough'd the Briton's rebel sea;_\r\n\r\n  _Oft boasting how the might of Spain\r\n    The world's old columns far outran,\r\n  And Hercules must come again,\r\n    And plant his barriers in Japan...._\r\n\r\n  _'Twas on St. Luke's soft, quiet day,\r\n    A vision to my sight was borne,\r\n  Fair as the blooming almond spray,\r\n    Blue-eyed, with tresses like the morn...._\r\n\r\n  _Ah! then I saw what love could do,\r\n    The power that bids us fall or rise,\r\n  That wounds the firm heart through and through,\r\n    And strikes, like Cæsar, at men's eyes._\r\n\r\n  _I saw how dupes, that fain would run,\r\n    Are caught, their breath and courage spent,\r\n  Chased by a foe they cannot shun,\r\n    Swift as Inquisitor on scent...._\r\n\r\n  _Yet I've a trick to cheat Love's search,\r\n    And refuge find too long delay'd;\r\n  I'll take the vows of Holy Church,\r\n    And seek some reverend cloister's shade._\"\r\n\r\nAmong Góngora's followers none is better known than Juan de Tassis y\r\nPeralta, the second CONDE DE VILLAMEDIANA (1582-1622), whose ancestors\r\ncame from Bergamo. His great-grandfather, Juan Bautista de Tassis,\r\nentered the service of Carlos Quinto; his grandfather, Raimundo de\r\nTassis, was the first of his race to live in Spain, where he married\r\ninto the illustrious family of Acuña; his father, Juan de Tassis y\r\nAcuña, rose to be Ambassador in Paris and Special Envoy in London.\r\nVillamediana's tutors were two well-known men of letters: Bartolomé\r\nJiménez Patón, author of _Mercurius Trismegistus_, and Tribaldos\r\nde Toledo, whom we already know as editor of Figueroa and Mendoza.\r\nAfter a short stay at Salamanca, Villamediana was appointed to the\r\nKing's household, and in 1601 married Ana de Mendoza y de la Cerda,\r\ngrand-daughter in the fifth generation of Santillana. His reputation\r\nas a gambler was of the worst, and his winning thirty thousand gold\r\nducats at a sitting led to his expulsion from court in 1608. He joined\r\nthe army in Italy, returned to Spain in 1617, and at once launched\r\ninto epigrams and satires against all and sundry. The court favourites\r\nwere his special mark—Lerma, Osuna, Uceda, Rodrigo Calderón. In 1618\r\nhe was again banished, but returned in 1621 as Lord-in-Waiting to the\r\nQueen, Isabel de Bourbon, daughter of Henry of Navarre. At her request\r\nVillamediana wrote a masque, _La Gloria de Niquea_, in which the Queen\r\nacted on April 8, 1622, before Lord Bristol. If report speak truly,\r\nthe performance led him to his death. When the second act opened, an\r\noverturned lamp set the theatre ablaze, and as Villamediana seized the\r\nQueen in his arms, and carried her out of danger, scandal declared the\r\nfire to be his doing, and gave him out as the Queen's lover. There\r\nis a well-known story that Felipe IV., stealing up behind the Queen\r\none day, placed his hands on her eyes; whereon \"Be quiet, Count,\"\r\nshe said, and so unwittingly doomed Villamediana. The tale is even\r\ntoo well known. Brantôme had already told it in _Les Dames galantes_\r\nbefore Felipe was born, and it really dates from the sixth century.\r\nEven so, Villamediana's admiration for the Queen was openly expressed.\r\nHe appeared at a tournament covered with silver _reales_, and used\r\nthe motto, \"_Mis amores son reales_\" (My love is royal). The King's\r\nconfessor, Baltasar de Zúñiga, warned him that his life was in danger,\r\nand Villamediana laughed in his face. It was no joke, for he had\r\ncontrived to make more dangerous enemies in four months than any other\r\nman has made in a lifetime. On August 21, 1622, as he was alighting\r\nfrom his coach, a stranger ran him through the body; \"_¡Jesús! esto\r\nes hecho!_\" (\"My God! done for!\") said Villamediana, and fell dead.\r\nThe word was passed round that the assassin, Ignacio Méndez, should go\r\nfree; tongues that had hitherto wagged were still. It is almost certain\r\nthat the murder was done by the King's order. If it were so, Felipe IV.\r\nhad more spirit at seventeen than he ever showed afterwards.\r\n\r\nVillamediana had many of Góngora's qualities: his courage, his wit, his\r\nsense of form, his preciosity. In his _Fábula de Faetón_, as in his\r\n_Fábula de la Fénix_, he outdoes his master in eccentricity and verbal\r\nfoppery: fish become \"swimming birds of the cerulean seat,\" water is\r\n\"liquid nutriment,\" time \"gnaws statues and digests the marble\"; and by\r\nhyperbaton and word-juggling he proves himself as _culto_ as he can.\r\nBut it is fair to say that when it pleases him he is as simple and\r\ndirect as the early Góngora. It must suffice here to quote Churton's\r\nrendering of a sonnet on the proposed marriage of the Infanta Doña\r\nMaría to the Prince of Wales:—\r\n\r\n  \"_By Heresy upborne, that giantess\r\n    Whose pride heaven's battlements in fancy scales,\r\n    With Villiers his proud Admiral, Charles of Wales\r\n  To Mary's heavenly sphere would boldly press.\r\n  A heretic he is, he must confess\r\n    Heaven's light ne'er led his knighthood's roving sails;\r\n    But the bright cause his error countervails,\r\n  And heavenly beauty pleads for love's excess.\r\n  So now the lamb with cub of wolf must mate;\r\n    The dove must take the raven to her nest;\r\n  Our palace, like the old ark, must shelter all:\r\n  Confusion, as of Babylon the Great,\r\n    Is round us, and the faith of Spain, oppress'd\r\n  By fine State-reason, trembles to its fall._\"\r\n\r\nThis expresses—much more clearly than the _Gloria de Niquea_—the true\r\nfeeling of Góngora and his circle towards Steenie and Baby Charles.\r\n\r\nLess nervous and energetic, but not less fantastic than Villamediana's\r\nworst extravagances, are the _Obras póstumas divinas y humanas_ (1641)\r\nof HORTENSIO FÉLIX PARAVICINO Y ARTEAGA (1580-1633), whose praises were\r\nsung by Lope:—\r\n\r\n  \"_Divine Hortensio, whose exalted strain,\r\n    Sweet, pure, and witty, censure cannot wound,\r\n  The Cyril and the Chrysostom of Spain._\"\r\n\r\nThe divine Hortensio was court-preacher to Felipe IV., and enchanted\r\nhis congregations by preaching in the _culto_ style. His verses\r\nexaggerate Góngora's worst faults, and are disfigured by fulsome\r\nflattery of his leader, before whom, as he says, he is dumb with\r\nadmiration. As thus:—\"May my offering in gracious cloud, in equal\r\nwealth of fragrance, bestrew thine altars.\" Paravicino, whose works\r\nwere published under the name of Arteaga, was a powerful centre\r\nof Gongoristic influence, and did more than most men to force\r\n_culteranismo_ into fashion. In sermons, poems, and a masque entitled\r\n_Gridonia_, he never ceases to spread the plague, which lasted for\r\na century, attacking writers as far apart as Ambrosio Roca y Serna\r\n(whose _Luz del Alma_ appeared in 1623), and Agustín de Salazar, the\r\nauthor of the _Cítara de Apolo_ (1677).\r\n\r\nMeanwhile a few held out against the mode. The Sevillan, Juan de\r\nArguijo (? d. 1629), continued the tradition of Herrera, writing in\r\nItalian measures with a smoothness of versification and a dignified\r\ncorrectness which drew applause from one camp and hissing from the\r\nother. His townsman, JUAN DE JÁUREGUI Y AGUILAR (? 1570-1650), came\r\ninto notice with his version of Tasso's _Aminta_ (1607), one of the\r\nbest translations ever made, deserving of the high praise which\r\nCervantes bestows on it and on Cristóbal de Figueroa's rendering of the\r\n_Pastor Fido_:—\"They make us doubt which is the translation and which\r\nthe original.\" In his _Aminta_, as in his original poems, Jáuregui's\r\nstyle is a model of purity and refinement, as might be expected from\r\nthe _Discurso poético_ launched later against Góngora; but the tide\r\nwas too strong for him. His _Orfeo_ (1624) shows signs of wavering,\r\nand in his translation, the _Farsalia_, which was not published till\r\n1684, he is almost as extreme a Gongorist as the worst. Still it\r\nshould be remembered that Lucan also was a Córdoban, practising early\r\nGongorism at Nero's court, and a translator is prone to reproduce the\r\ndefects of his original. Jáuregui has some points of resemblance with\r\nRossetti, was a famous artist in his day, and is said, on the strength\r\nof a dubious passage in the prologue to the _Novelas_, to have painted\r\nCervantes.\r\n\r\nESTEBAN MANUEL DE VILLEGAS (1596-1669) shows rare poetic qualities in\r\nhis _Eróticas ó Amatorias_ (1617), in which he announces himself as\r\nthe rising sun. _Sicut sol matutinus_ is printed on his title-page,\r\nwhere those waning stars, Lope, Calderón, and Quevedo, are also\r\nsupplied with a prophetic motto: _Me surgente, quid istæ?_ His\r\nimitations of Anacreon and Catullus are done with amazing gusto,\r\nall the more wonderful when we remember that his \"sweet songs and\r\nsuave delights\" were written at fourteen, retouched and published at\r\ntwenty. But Villegas is one of the great disappointments of Castilian\r\nliterature: he married in 1626, deserted verse for law, and ended life\r\na poor, embittered attorney. The Sevillan canon and royal librarian,\r\nFRANCISCO DE RIOJA (? 1586-1659), follows the example of Herrera,\r\nhis sonnets and _silvas_ being distinguished for their correct form\r\nand their philosophic melancholy. But Rioja has been unlucky. One\r\npoem, entitled _Las Ruinas de Itálica_, has won for him a very great\r\nreputation; and yet, in fact, as Fernández-Guerra y Orbe has proved,\r\nthe _Ruinas_ is due to Rodrigo Caro (1573-1647), the archæologist who\r\nwrote the _Memorial de Utrera_ and the _Antigüedades de Sevilla_.\r\nAdolfo de Castro goes further, ascribing the _Epístola moral á Fabio_\r\nto Pedro Fernández de Andrado, author of the _Libro de la Gineta_. Thus\r\ndespoiled of two admirable pieces, Rioja is less important than he\r\nseemed thirty years since; yet, even so, he ranks, with the Príncipe de\r\nEsquilache (1581-1658) and the Conde de Rebolledo (1597-1676), among\r\nthe sounder influences of his time.\r\n\r\nThe Segovian poet, Alonso de Ledesma Buitrago (1552-1623), founded the\r\nschool of _conceptismo_ with its metaphysical conceits, philosophic\r\nparadoxes, and sententious moralisings, as of a Seneca gone mad. His\r\n_Conceptos espirituales_ and _Juegos de la Noche Buena_ (1611) lead up\r\nto the allegorical gibberish of his _Monstruo Imaginado_ (1615), and to\r\nthe perverted ingenuity of Alonso de Bonilla's _Nuevo Jardín de Flores\r\ndivinas_ (1617). _Conceptismo_ was no less an evil than _culteranismo_,\r\nbut it was less likely to spread: the latter played with words, the\r\nformer with ideas. A bizarre vocabulary was enough for a man to pass as\r\n_culto_; the _conceptista_ must be equipped with various learning, and\r\nmust have a smattering of philosophy. Under such chiefs as Ledesma and\r\nBonilla the new mania must have died; but _conceptismo_ was in the air,\r\nand, as Carrillo seduced Góngora, so Ledesma captured FRANCIS GÓMEZ\r\nDE QUEVEDO Y VILLEGAS (1580-1645): (it should be said, however, that\r\nQuevedo nowhere mentions Ledesma by name). Like Lope, like Calderón,\r\nQuevedo was a highlander. His family boasted the punning motto:—\"I am\r\nhe who stopped—_el que vedó_—the Moors' advance.\" His father (who\r\ndied early) and mother both held posts at court. At Alcalá de Henares,\r\nfrom 1596 onwards, Quevedo took honours in theology, law, French,\r\nLatin, Greek, Arabic, and Hebrew. He is also said to have studied\r\nmedicine; and certainly he hated Sangrado as Dickens hated Bumble. When\r\nscarcely out of his teens he corresponded with Justus Lipsius, who\r\nhailed him as _μέγα κῦδος Ἱβήρων_, and at Madrid he speedily became\r\nthe talk of the town. Strange stories were told of him: that he had\r\npinked his man at Alcalá, that he ran Captain Rodríguez through the\r\nbody rather than yield him the wall, that he put an escaped panther to\r\nthe sword, that he disarmed the famous fencing-master, Pacheco Narváez.\r\nThis last tale is true, and is curious in view of Quevedo's physical\r\ndefects. His reply to Vicencio Valerio in _Su Espada por Santiago_ is\r\nwell known:—\"He says I hobble, and can't see. I should lie from head\r\nto foot if I denied it: my eyes and my gait would contradict me.\"\r\n\r\nFor all his short sight and clubbed feet, he was ever too ready with\r\nhis rapier. On Maundy Thursday, 1611, he witnessed a scuffle between\r\na man and woman during Tenebræ in St. Martin's Church. He intervened,\r\nthe argument was continued outside, swords were crossed, and Quevedo's\r\nopponent fell mortally wounded. As the man was a noble, Quevedo\r\nprudently escaped from possible consequences to Sicily. He returned to\r\nhis estate, La Torre de Juan Abad, in 1612, but soon wearied of country\r\nlife, and was sent on diplomatic missions to Genoa, Milan, Venice, and\r\nRome. On Osuna's promotion to Naples, Quevedo became Finance Minister,\r\nproving himself a capable administrator. In 1618 he meddled in the\r\nSpanish plot which forms the motive of Otway's _Venice Preserved_, and,\r\ndisguised as a beggar, escaped from the bravos told off to murder him.\r\nHis public career ended at this time, for his subsequent appointment\r\nas Felipe IV.'s secretary was merely nominal. In 1627 he shared in a\r\nfurious polemic. Santa Teresa was canonised in 1622, and, at the joint\r\ninstance of Carmelites and Jesuits, was made co-patron of Spain with\r\nSantiago. The Papal Bull (July 31, 1627) divided Spain into two camps.\r\nQuevedo, who was of the Order of Santiago—\"red with the blood of the\r\nbrave\"—took up the cudgels for St. James, was branded a \"hypocritical\r\nblackguard\" by one party, and was extolled by the other as the \"Captain\r\nof Combat,\" \"the Ensign of the Apostle.\" He shamed Pope, King,\r\nOlivares, the religious, and half the laity, and the Bull was withdrawn\r\n(June 28, 1630). The victory cost him a year's exile, and when Olivares\r\noffered him the embassy at Genoa, he refused it, on the ground that he\r\ndid not wish to have his mouth thus closed. After his unlucky marriage\r\nto Esperanza de Mendoza, widow of Juan Fernández de Heredia, he began a\r\ncampaign against the royal favourite. Olivares' turn came in December\r\n1639, when the King found by his plate a copy of verses urging him to\r\ncease his extravagance and to dismiss his incapable ministers. Quevedo\r\nwas—perhaps rightly—suspected of writing these lines, was arrested\r\nat midnight, and was whisked away, half dressed, to the monastery of\r\nSt. Mark in León. For four years he was imprisoned in a cell below\r\nthe level of the river, and, when released after Olivares' fall in\r\n1643, his health was broken. A flash of his old humour appears in\r\nhis reply to the priest who begged him to arrange for music at his\r\nfuneral:—\"Nay, let them pay that hear it.\"\r\n\r\nAs a prose writer he began with a _Life of St. Thomas of Villanueva_\r\n(1620), and ended with a _Life of St. Paul the Apostle_ (1644).\r\nThese, and his other moralisings—_Virtue Militant_, the _Cradle and\r\nthe Tomb_—call for no notice here. The _Política de Dios_ (1618) is\r\napparently an abstract plea for absolutism; in fact, it exposes the\r\nweakness of Spanish administration just as the _Marcus Brutus_ (1644)\r\nis a vehicle for opinions on contemporary politics. Learned and acute,\r\nthese treatises show Quevedo's concern for his country's future, and a\r\npassage in his sixty-eighth sonnet forecasts the future of the Spanish\r\ncolonies:—\"'Tis likelier far, O Spain! that what thou alone didst take\r\nfrom all, all will take from thee alone\"—\r\n\r\n  \"_Y es más facil! oh España ¡en muchas modas\r\n  Que lo que á todos les quitaste sola,\r\n  Te puedan á tí sola quitar todos._\"\r\n\r\nThe prophecy is just being fulfilled, and the chief interest\r\nof Quevedo's prose treatises lies in their _conceptismo_—the\r\nflashy epigram, the pompous paradox, the strained antithesis, the\r\nhairsplitting and refining in and out of season. It was vain for\r\nQuevedo to edit Luis de León and Torre as a protest against Gongorism,\r\nfor in his own practice he substituted one affectation for another.\r\n\r\nThe true and simpler Quevedo is to be sought elsewhere. His picaresque\r\n_Historia de la Vida del Buscón_, best known by its unauthorised\r\ntitle, _El Gran Tacaño_ (The Prime Scoundrel), though not published\r\ntill 1626, was probably written soon after 1608. Pablo, son of a\r\nbarber and a loose woman, follows a rich schoolfellow to Alcalá, where\r\nhe shines in every kind of devilry. Thence he passes into a gang of\r\nthieves, is imprisoned, lives as a sham cripple, an actor, a bravo, and\r\nfinally—his author being weary of him—emigrates to America. There\r\nis no attempt at creating character, no vulgar obtrusion of Alemán's\r\nmoralising tone: such amusement as the novel contains is afforded by\r\nthe invention of heartless incident and the acrid rendering of villany.\r\nThe harsh jeering, the intense brutality, the unsympathetic wit and art\r\nof the _Buscón_, make it one of the cleverest books in the world, as it\r\nis one of the cruellest and coarsest in its misanthropic enjoyment of\r\nbaseness and pain. No less characteristic of Quevedo are his _Sueños_\r\n(Visions), printed in 1627. These fantastic pieces are really five in\r\nnumber, though most collections print seven or eight; for the _Infierno\r\nEnmendado_ (Hell Reformed) is not a vision, but is rather a sequel to\r\nthe _Política de Dios_; the _Casa de Locos de Amor_ is probably the\r\nwork of Quevedo's friend, Lorenzo van der Hammen; and the _Fortuna con\r\nSeso_ was not written till 1635. Quevedo himself calls the _Sueño de\r\nla Muerte_ (Vision of Death) the fifth and last of the series. Satire\r\nin Lucian's manner had already been introduced into Spanish literature\r\nby Valdés in the _Diálogo de Mercurio y Carón_, in the _Crotalón_\r\n(which most authorities ascribe to Cristóbal de Villalón), and in the\r\n_Coloquio de los Perros_. In witty observation and ridicule of whole\r\nsections of society, Quevedo almost vies with Cervantes, though his\r\nunfeeling cynicism gives his work an individual flavour. His lost poets\r\nare doomed to hear each other's verses for eternity, his statesmen\r\njostle bandits, doctors and murderers end their careers as brethren,\r\ncomic men dwell in an inferno apart lest their jokes should damp hell's\r\nfires,—grim jests which may be read in Roger L'Estrange's spirited\r\namplification.\r\n\r\nQuevedo's serious poems suffer from the _conceptismo_ which disfigures\r\nhis ambitious prose; his wit, his complete knowledge of low life, his\r\nmastery of language show to greater advantage in his picaroon ballads\r\nand exercises in lighter verse. His freedom of tone has brought upon\r\nhim an undeserved reputation for obscenity; the fact being that lewd,\r\ntimorous fellows have fathered their indecencies upon him. A passage\r\nfrom his _Last Will of Don Quixote_ may be cited, as Mr. Gibson gives\r\nit, to illustrate his natural method:—\r\n\r\n  \"_Up and answered Sancho Panza;\r\n    List to what he said or sung,\r\n  With an accent rough and ready\r\n    And a forty-parson tongue:\r\n  ''Tis not reason, good my master,\r\n    When thou goest forth, I wis,\r\n  To account to thy Creator,\r\n    Thou shouldst utter stuff like this;\r\n  As trustees, name thou the Curate\r\n    Who confesseth thee betimes,\r\n  And Per Anton, our good Provost,\r\n    And the goat-herd Gaffer Grimes;\r\n  Make clean sweep of the Esplandians,\r\n    Who have dinned us with their clatter;\r\n  Call thou in a ghostly hermit,\r\n    Who may aid thee in the matter.'\r\n  'Well thou speakest,' up and answered\r\n    Don Quixote, nowise dumb;\r\n  'Hie thee to the Rock of Dolour,\r\n    Bid Beltenebros to come!_'\"\r\n\r\nOverpraised and overblamed, Quevedo attempted too much. He had it\r\nin him to be a poet, or a theologian, or a stoic philosopher, or\r\na critic, or a satirist, or a statesman: he insisted on being all\r\nof these together, and he has paid the penalty. Though he never\r\nfails ignominiously, he rarely achieves a genuine success, and\r\nthe bulk of his writing is now neglected because of its local and\r\nephemeral interest. Yet he deserves honour as the most widely-gifted\r\nSpaniard of his time, as a strong and honest man in a corrupt age,\r\nand as a brilliant writer whose hatred of the commonplace beguiled\r\nhim into adopting a dull innovation. It is not likely that his\r\nnumerous inedited lyrics will do more than increase our knowledge of\r\nGóngora's and Montalbán's failings; but the two plays promised by Sr.\r\nMenéndez y Pelayo—_Cómo ha de ser el Privado_ and _Pero Vázquez de\r\nEscamilla_—cannot but reveal a new aspect of a many-sided genius.\r\n\r\nQuevedo was not, however, known as a dramatist to the same extent as\r\nthe Valencian, GUILLÉN DE CASTRO Y BELLVIS (1569-1631), an erratic\r\nsoldier who has achieved renown in and out of Spain. Castro is\r\nsometimes credited with the _Prodigio de los Montes_, whence Calderón\r\nderived his _Mágico Prodigioso_, but the _Prodigio_ is almost certainly\r\nby Lope. Castro's fame rests on his _Mocedades del Cid_ (The Cid's\r\nFirst Exploits), a dramatic adaptation of national tradition in Lope's\r\nmanner. Ximena, daughter of Lozano, loves Rodrigo before the action\r\nbegins, and, on Lozano's death by Rodrigo's hand, her passion and\r\nher duty are in conflict. Rodrigo's victories against the Moors help\r\nto expiate his crime: on a false rumour of his death, Ximena avows\r\nher love for him, and patriotism combines with inclination to yield a\r\ndramatic ending. Corneille, treating Castro's play with the freedom of\r\na man of genius, founded the French school of tragedy; but not all his\r\nchanges are improvements. By limiting the time of action he needlessly\r\nemphasises the difficulty of the situation. Castro's device is sounder\r\nwhen he prolongs the space which shall diminish Ximena's filial grief\r\nand increase her admiration of the Cid. The strife between love and\r\nhonour exists already in the Spanish, and Corneille's merit lies in\r\nhis suppression of Castro's superfluous third act, in his magnificent\r\nrhetoric, beside which the Spaniard's simplicity seems weak. But though\r\nCastro wrote no masterpiece, he begot one based upon his original\r\nconception, and some of Corneille's most admired tirades are but\r\namplified translations.\r\n\r\nLess remarkable as a playwright than as a novelist, the lawyer, LUIS\r\nVÉLEZ DE GUEVARA (1570-1643); is reputed to have written no fewer than\r\nfour hundred pieces for the stage. Of these, eighty survive, mostly on\r\nhistoric themes, which—as in _El Valor no tiene Edad_—are treated\r\nwith tiresome extravagance; but the most difficult critics have found\r\npraise for _Más pesa el Rey que la Sangre_ (King First, Blood Second).\r\nThe story is that, in the thirteenth century, Guzmán the Good held\r\nTarifa for King Sancho; the rebel Infante, Don Juan, called upon him\r\nto surrender under pain of his son's death; for answer, Guzmán threw\r\nhis dagger over the battlement, and saw the boy murdered before his\r\neyes. Rarely has the old Castilian tradition of loyalty to the King\r\nbeen presented with more picturesque force, and few scenes in any\r\ndramatic literature surpass that last one on the raising of the siege,\r\nwhen Guzmán points to his child's corpse. Vélez de Guevara collaborated\r\nwith Rojas Zorrilla and Mira de Amescua in _The Devil's Suit against\r\nthe Priest of Madrilejos_, a play in which a lunatic girl saves her\r\nlife by pleading demoniacal possession. The idea is characteristic of\r\nGuevara's uncanny invention; but the Inquisition frowned upon stage\r\nrepresentatives of exorcism, and, though the author's orthodoxy was\r\nnot questioned, the play was withdrawn. He is best remembered for his\r\nsatire _El Diablo Cojuelo_ (1641), which describes observations taken\r\nduring a flight through the air by a student who releases the Lame\r\nDevil from a flask, and is repaid by glimpses of life in courts and\r\nslums and stews. Le Sage, in his _Diable Boiteux_, has greatly improved\r\nupon the first conception; but the original is of excellent humour,\r\nand the style is as idiomatic as the best Castilian can be. Felipe IV.\r\nis said to have smiled only three times in his life—twice at quips by\r\nGuevara, who was his chamberlain.\r\n\r\nOf all Lope's imitators the most undisguised is the son of the King's\r\nbookseller, Doctor JUAN PÉREZ DE MONTALBÁN (1602-38), who became a\r\npriest of the Congregation of St. Peter in 1625. His father was plain\r\nJuan Pérez (as who should say John Smith), and the son was cruelly\r\nbantered for his airs and graces:—\"Put Doctor in front and Montalbán\r\nbehind, and plebeian Pérez shines an aristocrat.\" It was rumoured that\r\nhis _Orfeo_ (1624), written to compete with Jáuregui, was really Lope's\r\nwork, given by the patriarch to start his favourite in life. The story\r\nis probably false, for the verse lacks Lope's ease and grace; but the\r\n_Orfeo_ won Montalbán a name, and—there is no such luck for modern\r\nminor poets—in 1625 a Peruvian merchant expressed his admiration by\r\nsettling a pension on the young priest. Montalbán lived in closest\r\nintimacy with Lope, who taught his young admirer stagecraft, and helped\r\nhim with introductions to managers. Unluckily he sought to rival his\r\nmaster in fecundity as well as in method, and the effort broke him.\r\nHe is often credited with writing the _Tribunal of Just Vengeance_, a\r\nwork which describes Quevedo as \"Master of Error, Doctor of Impudence,\r\nLicentiate of Buffoonery, Bachelor of Filth, Professor of Vice, and\r\nArchdevil of Mankind.\" Quevedo, on his side, had a grievance, inasmuch\r\nas Pérez, the bookseller, had pirated the _Buscón_. He prophesied that\r\nMontalbán would die a lunatic, and, in fact, his words came true.\r\n\r\nPellicer credits Montalbán with literary theories of his own, but they\r\nare mere repetitions of Lope's precepts in the _Arte Nuevo_. Like his\r\nmaster, Montalbán has a keen eye for a situation, for the dramatic\r\nvalue of a popular story, as he shows in his _Amantes de Teruel_, those\r\neternal types of constancy; but he writes too hurriedly, with more\r\nambition than power, is infected with _culteranismo_, and, though he\r\napes Lope with superficial success in his secular plays, fails utterly\r\nwhen he attempts the sacred drama. His own age thought most highly of\r\n_No hay Vida como la Honra_, one of the first pieces to have a \"run\" on\r\nthe Spanish stage; but the _Amantes_ is his best work, and its vigorous\r\ndialogue may still be read with emotion.\r\n\r\nThese lovers of Teruel were also staged by a man of genius whose\r\npseudonym has completely overshadowed his family name of Gabriel\r\nTéllez. The career of TIRSO DE MOLINA (1571-1648) is often dismissed\r\nin six lines packed with errors; but the publication of Sr. Cotarelo\r\ny Mori's study has made such summary treatment impossible in the\r\nfuture. Writers whose imagination does service for research have\r\ninvented the fables that Tirso led a scandalous, stormy life, and that\r\nthe repentant sinner took orders in middle age. These legends are\r\nbaseless, and are conceived on the theory that Tirso's outspoken plays\r\nimply a deep knowledge of human nature's weak side and of the shadiest\r\npicaresque corners. It appears to be forgotten that Tirso spent years\r\nin the confessional: no bad position for the study of frailty. It\r\nseems certain that he was born at Madrid, and that he studied at\r\nAlcalá is clear from Matías de los Reyes' dedication of _El Agravio\r\nagraviado_. The date of his profession is not known; but he is named as\r\na Mercedarian monk and as \"a comic poet\" by the actor-manager, Andrés\r\nde Claramonte y Corroy, in his _Letanía moral_, written before 1610,\r\nthough not printed till 1613. His holograph of _Santa Juana_ is dated\r\nin 1613 from Toledo, where he also wrote his _Cigarrales_. Passages in\r\n_La Gallega Mari Hernández_ imply a residence in Galicia. That he lived\r\nin Seville, and visited the island of Santo Domingo, is certain, though\r\nthe dates are not known. In 1619 he was Superior of the Mercedarian\r\nconvent at Trujillo, an appointment which implies that he was a monk of\r\nlong standing. In 1620 Lope dedicated to him _Lo Fingido verdadero_,\r\nand in the same year Tirso returned the compliment by dedicating his\r\n_Villana de Vallecas_ to Lope. Though he competed in 1622 at the Madrid\r\nfeasts in honour of St. Isidore, he failed to receive even honourable\r\nmention. Ten years later he became official chronicler of his order,\r\nand showed his opinion of his predecessor, Alonso Remón—with whom he\r\nhas been confounded, even by Cervantes—by rewriting Remón's history.\r\nIn 1634 he was made _Definidor General_ for Castile, and his name\r\nreappears as licenser of books, or in legal documents. He died on March\r\n21, 1648, being then Prior at Soria, renowned as a preacher of most\r\ntranquil, virtuous life, the very opposite of what ignorant fancy has\r\nfeigned of him. He is known to have written plays so recently as 1638,\r\nfor the holograph of his _Quinas de Portugal_ bears that date; but the\r\npreface to the _Deleitar Aprovechado_ shows that his popularity was on\r\nthe wane in 1635. His last years were given to writing a _Genealogía\r\ndel Conde de Sástago_ and the chronicle of the Mercedarian Order.\r\n\r\nTirso's earliest printed volume is his _Cigarrales de Toledo_ (1621 or\r\n1624), so called from a local Toledan word for a summer country-house\r\nset down in an orchard. The book is a collection of tales and verse,\r\nsupposed to be recited during five days of festivity which have\r\nfollowed a wedding. Tirso, indeed, announces stories and verse which\r\nshall last twenty days; yet he breaks off at the fifth, announcing a\r\nSecond Part, which never appeared. Critics profess to find in Tirso's\r\ntales some traces of Cervantes, who is praised in the text as the\r\n\"Spanish Boccaccio\": the influence of the Italian Boccaccio is far\r\nmore obvious throughout, and—save for a tinge of Gongorism—_Los\r\nTres Maridos burlados_ might well pass as a splendid adaptation from\r\nthe _Decamerone_. Still, even in the _Cigarrales_ the born playwright\r\nasserts himself in _Cómo han de ser los Amigos_, in _El Celoso\r\nprudente_, and in one of Tirso's most brilliant pieces, _El Vergonzoso\r\nen Palacio_. A second collection entitled _Deleitar Aprovechado_\r\n(Business with Profit), issued in 1635, contains three pious tales\r\nof no great merit, and several _autos_, one of which—_El Colmenero\r\ndivino_—is Tirso's best attempt at religious drama.\r\n\r\nEssentially a dramatist, he is to be but partially studied in his\r\ntheatre, of which the first part appeared in 1627, the third in 1634,\r\nthe second and fourth in 1635, and the fifth in 1637. A famous play is\r\nthe _Condenado por Desconfiado_ (The Doubter Damned), of which some\r\nwould deprive Tirso; yet the treatment is specially characteristic of\r\nhim. Paulo, who has left the world for a hermitage, prays for light\r\nas to his future salvation, dreams that his sins exceed his merits,\r\nand is urged by the devil to go to Naples to seek out Enrico, whose\r\nending will be like his own. Paulo obeys, discovers Enrico to be a\r\nrook and bully, and in despair takes to a bandit's life. Meanwhile\r\nEnrico shows a hint of virtue by refusing to slay an old man whose\r\nappearance reminds the bully of his own father, and kills the master\r\nwho taunted him with flinching from a bargain. He escapes to where\r\nPaulo and his gang are hidden. Garbed as a hermit, Paulo vainly exhorts\r\nEnrico to confess, though the criminal finally repents, and is seen by\r\nPedrisco—Paulo's servant—passing to heaven. Duped by the devil, Paulo\r\nrefuses to believe Pedrisco's story, and dies damned through his own\r\ndistrust and pride. The substance of this play, which is contrived with\r\nabounding skill and theological knowledge, is the old conflict between\r\nfree-will and predestination. Some would ascribe the play to Lope,\r\nbecause the pastoral scenes are in his manner, but the notion that Lope\r\nwould publish under Tirso's name is untenable. Sr. Menéndez y Pelayo\r\nwill not be suspected of a prejudice against Lope; and he avers, in so\r\nmany words, that the only playwright in Spain with enough theology\r\nto write the _Condenado_ was Tirso, who, had he written nothing else,\r\nwould rank among the greatest Spanish dramatists.\r\n\r\nThe piece which has won Tirso immortality is his _Burlador de Sevilla\r\ny Convidado de Piedra_ (The Seville Mocker and the Stone Guest), first\r\nprinted at Barcelona in 1630 as the seventh of _Twelve New Plays by\r\nLope de Vega Carpio, and other Authors_; and the omission of the\r\n_Burlador_ from all authorised editions has led critics of authority\r\nto question Tirso's authorship.[27] The discovery in 1878 of a new\r\nversion caused Manuel de la Revilla to declare that the play was by\r\nCalderón, on the ground that Calderón's name is on the title-page,\r\nand that Calderón never trespassed on other men's property. This\r\nis an overstatement: to mention but a few instances, Calderón's _Á\r\nSecreto Agravio Secreta Venganza_ is re-arranged from Tirso's _Celoso\r\nprudente_; his _Secreto á Voces_ from Tirso's _Amar por Arte mayor_,\r\nwhile the second act of Calderón's _Cabellos de Absalón_ is lifted,\r\nalmost word for word, from the third act of Tirso's _Venganza de\r\nTamar_. On the whole, then, Tirso may be taken as the creator of Don\r\nJuan. No analysis is needed of a play with which Mozart, the most\r\nAthenian of musicians, has familiarised mankind; nor is translation\r\npossible in the present corrupt state of the text. Whether or not there\r\nexisted an historic Don Juan at Plasencia or at Seville is doubtful,\r\nfor folklorists have found the story as far away from Spain as Iceland\r\nis; but it is Tirso's glory to have so treated it that the world has\r\naccepted it as a purely Spanish conception. The _Festin de Pierre_\r\n(1659) by Dorimond, the _Fils Criminel_ (1660) of De Villiers, the\r\n_Dom Juan_ (1665) of Molière, the _Nouveau Festin de Pierre_ (1670)\r\nof Rosimond, and the arrangement of Thomas Corneille, are but pale\r\nreflections of the Spanish type which passes onward from Shadwell's\r\n_Libertine_ (1676) till it reaches the hands of Byron and Zorrilla and\r\nBarbey d'Aurévilly and Flaubert (whose posthumous sketch comes closer\r\nback to the original). Of these later artists not one has succeeded in\r\nmatching the patrician dignity, the infernal, iniquitous valour of the\r\noriginal. To have created a universal type, to have imposed a character\r\nupon the world, to have outlived all rivalry, to have achieved in words\r\nwhat Mozart alone has expressed in music, is to rank among the great\r\ncreators of all time.\r\n\r\nIf Tirso excelled in sombre force, he was likewise a master in the\r\nlighter comedy of _El Vergonzoso en Palacio_, where Mireno, the Shy\r\nMan at Court, is rendered with rare sympathetic delicacy, and in the\r\nfarcical intrigue of _Don Gil de las Calzas verdes_ (Don Gil of the\r\nGreen Breeches), where the changes of Juana to Elvira or to Don Gil\r\nare such examples of subtle, gay ingenuity as delight and bewilder\r\nthe reader no less than the comic trio of the _Villana de Vallecas_,\r\nor the picture of unctuous hypocrisy in _Marta la piadosa_. Tirso's\r\nfate was to be forgotten, not merely by the public, but by the very\r\ndramatists who used his themes; and, as in Lope's case, the neglect is\r\npartly due to the rarity of his editions. Yet, even so, his eclipse\r\nis unaccountable, for his various gifts are hard to match in any\r\nliterature. He has not the disconcerting cleverness of Lope, nor has he\r\nLope's infinite variety of resource; moreover, his natural frankness\r\nhas won him a name for indecency. Yet has he imagination, passion,\r\nindividual vision, knowledge of dramatic effect. He could create\r\ncharacter, and his women, if less noble, are more real than Lope's own\r\nin their frank emotion and seductive abandonment. At whiles his diction\r\ntends to Gongorism, as when—in _El Amor y la Amistad_—a personage,\r\nat sight of a mountain, babbles of \"the lofty daring of the snow,\r\nthe pyramid of diamond\"; but this is exceptional, and his hostility\r\nto _culteranismo_ inspired Góngora to write more than one stinging\r\nepigram. Tirso had not Lope's matchless facility, and, considering\r\nthe maturity of the Spanish genius, it is strange that he should have\r\nwritten no play before 1606 or 1608. Moreover, he composed by fits and\r\nstarts in moments snatched from duty, and, beginning late, he ended\r\nearly. Even in these circumstances he could boast in 1621 that he\r\nhad produced three hundred plays—a number afterwards raised to four\r\nhundred. Only some eighty survive: in other words, four-fifths of his\r\ntheatre has vanished, and the loss is surely great for those who would\r\nfain know every aspect of his genius. But enough remains to justify his\r\nhigh position, and his fame, like Lope's, grows from day to day.\r\n\r\nOf such dramatists as the courtly Antonio Hurtado de Mendoza (?\r\n1590-1644), and the festive Luis Belmonte y Bermúdez (1587-? 1650)\r\nmere mention must suffice: the former's _Querer por sólo querer_ may\r\nbe read in an excellent version made by Sir Richard Fanshawe during\r\nhis imprisonment \"by Oliver, after the Battail of Worcester.\" Antonio\r\nMira de Amescua (? 1578-1640), chaplain of Felipe IV., mingled the\r\nhuman with the divine, was praised by all contemporaries from Cervantes\r\nonwards, had the right lyrical note, and, if his plays were collected,\r\nmight prove himself worthy of his dramatic fame; as it is, he is best\r\nknown as a playwright from whom Calderón, Moreto, and Corneille have\r\nborrowed themes. A more original talent is shown by JUAN RUIZ DE\r\nALARCÓN (? 1581-1639), whose father was administrator of the Tlacho\r\nmines in Mexico. Ruiz de Alarcón left Mexico for Spain in 1600, and\r\nstudied at Salamanca for five years; he returned to America in 1608 in\r\nthe hope of being elected to a University chair, but the deformity—a\r\nhunched back—with which he was taunted his life long was against\r\nhim, and he made for Spain in 1611. He entered the household of the\r\nMarqués de Salinas, wrote some laudatory _décimas_ for the _Desengaño\r\nde la Fortuna_ in 1612, and next year produced his first play, the\r\n_Semejante de sí mismo_, founded, like Tirso's _Celosa de sí misma_,\r\non the _Curious Impertinent_. It was no great success, but it made him\r\nknown and hated. He was far too ready to attack others, being himself\r\nmost vulnerable. Cristóbal Suárez de Figueroa, who had jeered at\r\nCervantes for \"writing prologues and dedications when at death's door,\"\r\nspoke for others besides himself when he lampooned Alarcón as \"an ape\r\nin man's guise, an impudent hunchback, a ludicrous deformity.\" Tirso\r\nbefriended the Mexican, while Mendoza, Lope, Quevedo, and the rest\r\nscourged him mercilessly; and when his _Antecristo_ (which Voltaire\r\nused in _Mahomet_) was played, a band of rioters ruined the performance\r\nby squirting oil on the spectators and firing squibs in the pit. Yet\r\nthe women always crowded the house when his name was in the bill, and\r\nthey made his fortune by contriving that his play, _Siempre ayuda la\r\nVerdad_—probably written in collaboration with Tirso—should be given\r\nat court in 1623. Three years later he was named Member of Council for\r\nthe Indies. His collected pieces were published in 1628 and 1634.\r\n\r\nRuiz de Alarcón was never popular in the sense that Lope and Calderón\r\nwere popular; still, he had his successes, and no Spanish dramatist\r\nis better reading. Compared with his rivals he was sterile, for the\r\ntotal of his plays is less than thirty, even if we accept all the\r\ndoubtful pieces ascribed to him. Lope excels him in invention, Tirso\r\nin force and fun, Calderón in charm; Ruiz de Alarcón is less intensely\r\nnational than these, and the very individuality—the _extrañeza_—which\r\nMontalbán noted with perplexity, makes him almost better appreciated\r\nabroad than at home. Corneille has based French tragedy upon Guillén de\r\nCastro's _Mocedades del Cid_; French comedy is scarcely less influenced\r\nby his adaptation of the _Menteur_ from Ruiz de Alarcón's _Verdad\r\nSospechosa_ (Truth Suspected). García has lied all his life, lies to\r\nhis father, his friends, his betrothed, lies to himself, and defeats\r\nhis own purpose by his ingenuity. He would speak the truth if he could,\r\nbut he has no talent that way. Why trouble with truth when lying comes\r\neasier? His father, Beltrán, perceives that the miser enjoys money,\r\nthat murder slakes vengeance, that the drunkard grows glorious with\r\nwine; but his son's failing is beyond him. The noble Philistine has\r\nnot the artist's soul, and cannot understand why García should lie for\r\nlying's sake, against his own interest. Throughout the play Ruiz de\r\nAlarcón is never once at fault, and the gay ingenuity with which he\r\nenforces the old moral, that honesty is the best policy, is equalled\r\nby his masterly creation of character. Ethics are his preoccupation;\r\nyet, though almost all his plays seek to enforce a lesson, he nowhere\r\ndescends to pulpiteering or merges the dramatist in the teacher. While\r\nin _Las Paredes Oyen_ (Walls have Ears) and in _El Examen de Maridos_\r\n(Husbands Proved) the triumph of the _Verdad Sospechosa_ is repeated,\r\nthe more national play is admirably exampled in _El Tejedor de Segovia_\r\n(The Weaver of Segovia) and _Ganar Amigos_ (How to Win Friends).\r\n\r\nThere are greater Spanish playwrights than Ruiz de Alarcón: there is\r\nnone whose work is of such even excellence. In so early a piece as the\r\n_Cueva de Salamanca_, though there is manifest technical inexperience,\r\nthe mere writing is almost as good as in _La Verdad Sospechosa_.\r\nThe very infertility at which contemporaries mocked is balanced by\r\nequality of execution. Lope and Calderón have written better pieces,\r\nand many worse: no line that Ruiz de Alarcón published is unworthy\r\nof him. While his contemporaries were content to improvise at ease,\r\nhe sat aloof, never joining in the race for money and applause, but\r\nfiling with a scrupulous conscience to such effect that all his work\r\nendures. His chief titles to fame are his power of creating character\r\nand his high ethical aim. But he has other merits scarcely less rare:\r\nhis versification is of extreme finish, and his spirited dialogue,\r\nfree from any tinge of Gongorism, is a triumph of fine idiom over\r\nperverse influences which led men of greater natural endowment astray.\r\nHis taste, indeed, is almost unerring, and it goes to form that sober\r\ndignity, that individual tone, that uncommon counterpoise of faculties\r\nwhich place him below—and a little apart from—the two or three best\r\nSpanish dramatists.\r\n\r\nIf there be an exotic element in the quality of Ruiz de Alarcón's\r\ndistinction as in his frugal dramatic method, the _españolismo_ of the\r\nland is incarnate in the genius of PEDRO CALDERÓN DE LA BARCA HENAO\r\nDE LA BARREDA Y RIAÑO (1600-1681), the most representative Spaniard of\r\nthe seventeenth century. His father was Secretary to the Treasury, and,\r\non this side, Calderón was a highlander, like Santillana, Lope, and\r\nQuevedo; he inherited a strain of Flemish blood through his mother, who\r\nclaimed descent from the De Mons of Hainault. He was educated at the\r\nJesuit Colegio Imperial in Madrid, and fond biographers declare that\r\nhe studied civil and canon law at Salamanca; this is mere assertion,\r\nunsupported by any proof. Though he is said to have written a play,\r\n_El Carro del Cielo_, at thirteen, he was not very precocious for a\r\nSpaniard, his first authentic appearances being made at the Feast of\r\nSt. Isidore in 1620 and 1622. On the latter occasion he won the third\r\nprize, and was praised by the good-natured Lope as one \"who in his\r\ntender years earns the laurels which time commonly awards to grey\r\nhairs.\" His Boswell, Vera Tasis, reports that he served in Milan and\r\nFlanders from 1625 to 1635; but there must be an error of date, for in\r\n1629 he is found at Madrid drawing his sword upon the actor, Pedro de\r\nVillegas, who had treacherously stabbed Calderón's brother, and who\r\nfled for sanctuary to the Trinitarian Church. The Gongorist preacher,\r\nParavicino, referred to the matter in public; Calderón replied by\r\nscoffing at \"sermons of Barbary,\" and was sent to gaol for insulting\r\nthe cloth. Pellicer signals another outburst in 1640, when the\r\ndramatist whipped out his sword at rehearsal and came off second best.\r\nThese are pleasing incidents in a career of sombre respectability,\r\nthough one half fears that the second is fiction. In 1637 Calderón\r\nwas promoted to the Order of Santiago, and in 1640 he served with his\r\nbrother knights against the Catalan rebels, hastily finishing his\r\n_Certamen de Amor y Celos_ (Strife of Love and Jealousy) so as to\r\nshare in the campaign. He was sent to Madrid on some military mission\r\nin 1641; received from the artillery fund a monthly pension of thirty\r\ngold crowns; was ordained priest in 1651; was made chaplain of the New\r\nKings at Toledo in 1653; became honorary chaplain to Felipe IV. in\r\n1663, when he joined the Congregation of St. Peter, which elected him\r\nits Superior in 1666. On taking orders, Calderón's intention was to\r\nforsake the secular stage, but he yielded to the King's command, and,\r\nso late as 1680, celebrated Carlos II.'s wedding with Marie Louise de\r\nBourbon. \"He died singing, as they say of the swan,\" wrote Solís to\r\nAlonso Carnero. When death took him he was busied with an _auto_, which\r\nwas finished by Melchor de León—a fit ending to a happy, blameless\r\nlife.\r\n\r\nCalderón's prose writings are small in volume and in importance. The\r\ndescription (written under the name of his colleague, Lorenzo Ramírez\r\nde Prado) of the entry into Madrid of Felipe IV.'s second queen is\r\nan official performance. More interest attaches to a treatise on the\r\ndignity of painting, first printed in the fourth volume of Francisco\r\nMariano Nifo's _Cajón de Sastre literato_ (1781):—\"Painting,\" says\r\nCalderón, \"is the art of arts, dominating all others and using them as\r\nhandmaids.\" He had an admirable gift of appreciation, and he proves it\r\nby rescuing from the oblivion of the _Cancionero General_ such a ballad\r\nas Escribá's, which he quotes in _Manos Blancas no ofenden_, and again\r\nin _El Mayor Monstruo de los Celos_. Churton's version of the song is\r\nnot unhappy:—\r\n\r\n  \"_Come, death, ere step or sound I hear,\r\n    Unknown the hour, unfelt the pain;\r\n  Lest the wild joy to feel thee near,\r\n    Should thrill me back to life again._\r\n\r\n  _Come, sudden as the lightning-ray,\r\n    When skies are calm and air is still;\r\n  E'en from the silence of its way,\r\n    More sure to strike where'er it will._\r\n\r\n  _Such let thy secret coming be,\r\n    Lest warning make thy summons vain,\r\n  And joy to find myself with thee\r\n    Call back life's ebbing tide again._\"\r\n\r\nA great lyric poet, his lyrics are mostly included in his plays.\r\nOne ballad, supposed to be a description of himself, written at a\r\nlady's request, is often quoted, and has been well Englished by Mr.\r\nNorman MacColl; it is, however, unauthentic, being due to a Sevillan\r\ncontemporary, Carlos Cepeda y Guzmán.[28] The earliest play printed\r\nwith Calderón's name is _El Astrólogo fingido_ (1632), and from 1633\r\nonwards collected editions of his works were published; but he had no\r\npersonal concern in these issues, which so presented him that, as he\r\nprotested, he could not recognise himself. Though he printed a volume\r\nof _autos_ in 1676, he was so indifferent as to the fate of his secular\r\nplays that he never troubled to collect them. Luckily, in 1680 he drew\r\nup a list of his pieces for the Duque de Veragua, the descendant of\r\nColumbus, and upon this foundation Vera Tasis constructed a posthumous\r\nedition in nine volumes. Roughly speaking, we possess one hundred and\r\ntwenty formal plays, and some seventy _autos_, with a few _entremeses_\r\nof no great account.\r\n\r\nCalderón has been fortunate in death as in life; for though his\r\nvogue never quite equalled that of his great predecessor, Lope, it\r\nproved far more enduring. From Lope's death to the close of the\r\nseventeenth century, Calderón was chief of the Spanish stage; and,\r\nthough he underwent a temporary eclipse in the eighteenth century, his\r\nsovereignty was restored in the nineteenth by the enthusiasm of the\r\nGerman Romantics. He has suffered more than most from the indiscretion\r\nof admirers. When Sismondi pronounced him simply a clever playwright,\r\n\"the poet of the Inquisition,\" he was no further from the truth than\r\nthe extravagant Friedrich Schlegel, who proclaimed that \"in this great\r\nand divine master the enigma of life is not merely expressed, but\r\nsolved\": thus placing him above Shakespeare, who (so raved the German)\r\nonly stated life's riddle without attempting a solution. James the\r\nFirst once said to the ambassador whom Ben Jonson called \"Old Æsop\r\nGondomar\":—\"I know not how, but it seems to be the trade of a Spaniard\r\nto talk rodomontade.\" It was no less the trade of the German Romantic,\r\nwho mistook lyrism for scenic presentation. Nor were the Germans alone\r\nin their enthusiasm. Shelley met with Calderón's ideal dramas, read\r\nthem \"with inexpressible wonder and delight,\" and was tempted \"to throw\r\nover their perfect and glowing forms the grey veil of my own words.\"\r\nThe famous speech of the Spirit replying, in the _Mágico Prodigioso_,\r\nto Cyprian's question, \"Who art thou, and whence comest thou?\" has\r\nbecome familiar to every reader of English literature:—\r\n\r\n  \"_Since thou desirest, I will then unveil\r\n  Myself to thee;—for in myself I am\r\n  A world of happiness and misery;\r\n  This I have lost, and that I must lament\r\n  For ever. In my attributes I stood\r\n  So high and so heroically great,\r\n  In lineage so supreme, and with a genius\r\n  Which penetrated with a glance the world\r\n  Beneath my feet, that was by my high merit.\r\n  A King—whom I may call the King of kings,\r\n  Because all others tremble in their pride\r\n  Before the terrors of his countenance—\r\n  In his high palace roofed with brightest gems\r\n  Of living light—call them the stars of heaven—\r\n  Named me his counsellor. But the high praise\r\n  Stung me with pride and envy, and I rose\r\n  In mighty competition, to ascend\r\n  His seat, and place my foot triumphantly\r\n  Upon his subject thrones. Chastised, I know\r\n  The depth to which ambition falls: too mad\r\n  Was the attempt, and yet more mad were now\r\n  Repentance of the irrevocable deed;\r\n  Therefore I close this ruin with the glory\r\n  Of not to be subdued, before the shame\r\n  Of reconciling me with him who reigns\r\n  By coward cession. Nor was I alone,\r\n  Nor am I now, nor shall I be alone;\r\n  And there was hope, and there may still be hope,\r\n  For many suffrages among his vassals\r\n  Hailed me their lord and king, and many still\r\n  Are mine, and many more shall be.\r\n  Thus vanquished, though in fact victorious,\r\n  I left his seat of empire._\"\r\n\r\nThis \"grey veil\" serves but to heighten the noble poetic quality which\r\nturned a cooler head than Shelley's. Goethe was moved to tears, and,\r\nthough towards the end he perceived the mischief wrought in Germany\r\nby the uncritical idolatry of Calderón, he never ceased to admire\r\nthe only Spanish poet that he really knew. And in our time men like\r\nSchack and Schmidt have dedicated their lives to the propagation of\r\nthe Calderonian gospel. Some part of the poet's fame is due to his\r\ntranslators, some also to the fact that for a long time there was\r\nno rival in the field. To the rest of Europe he has stood for Spain.\r\nReaders could not divine (and in default of editions they could not\r\ncontrive to learn) that Calderón, great as he is, comes far short\r\nof Lope's freshness, force, and invention, far short of Tirso's\r\ncreative power and impressive conception. But Spaniards know better\r\nthan to give him the highest place among their dramatic gods. He is\r\ntoo brilliant to be set aside as a mere follower of Lope's, for he\r\nrises to heights of poetry which Lope never reached; yet it is simple\r\nhistory that he did but develop the seed which Lope planted. He made\r\nno attempt—and there he showed good judgment—to reform the Spanish\r\ndrama; he was content to work upon the old ways, borrowing hints from\r\nhis predecessors, and, in a lazy mood, incorporating entire scenes.\r\nIf we are to believe Viguier and Philarète Chasles, he went so far as\r\nto annex Corneille's _Heraclius_ (1647), and publish it in 1664 as\r\n_En esta vida todo es verdad y todo es mentira_ (In this Life All's\r\nTrue and All's False); but, as he knew no French, the chances are that\r\nboth plays derive from a common source—Mira de Amescua's _Rueda de\r\nla fortuna_ (1614). In attempts to create character he almost always\r\nfails, and when he succeeds—as in _El Alcalde de Zalamea_—he succeeds\r\nby brilliantly retouching Lope's first sketch. Goethe hit Calderón's\r\nweak spot with the remark that his characters are as alike as bullets\r\nor leaden soldiers cast in the same mould; and the constant lyrical\r\ninterruptions go to show that he knew his own strength. Others might\r\nmatch and overcome him as a playwright: there was none to approach\r\nhim in such magnificent lyrism as he allots to Justina in _El Mágico\r\nProdigioso_—to be quoted here in FitzGerald's rendering:—\r\n\r\n  \"_Who that in his hour of glory\r\n    Walks the kingdom of the rose,\r\n  And misapprehends the story\r\n    Which through all the garden blows;\r\n  Which the southern air who brings\r\n  It touches, and the leafy strings\r\n    Lightly to the touch respond;\r\n  And nightingale to nightingale\r\n    Answering a bough beyond...._\r\n\r\n  _Lo! the golden Girasolé,\r\n    That to him by whom she burns,\r\n  Over heaven slowly, slowly,\r\n    As he travels, ever turns,\r\n  And beneath the wat'ry main\r\n  When he sinks, would follow fain,\r\n    Follow fain from west to east,\r\n  And then from east to west again...._\r\n\r\n  _So for her who having lighted\r\n    In another heart the fire,\r\n  Then shall leave it unrequited\r\n    In its ashes to expire:\r\n  After her that sacrifice\r\n  Through the garden burns and cries,\r\n  In the sultry, breathing air,\r\n  In the flowers that turn and stare...._\"\r\n\r\nSuch songs as these are, perhaps, better to read than to hear, and\r\nCalderón is careful to supply a more popular interest. This he finds\r\nin three sentiments which are still most characteristic of the Spanish\r\ntemperament: personal loyalty to the King, absolute devotion to the\r\nChurch, and the \"point of honour.\" Through good report and evil,\r\nSpain has held by the three principles which have made and undone\r\nher. These three sources of inspiration find their highest expression\r\nin the theatre of Calderón. A favourite with Felipe IV., a courtly\r\npoet, if ever one there were, he becomes the mouthpiece of a nation\r\nwhen he deifies the King in the _Príncipe Constante_, in _La Banda y\r\nla Flor_ (The Scarf and the Flower), in _Guárdate de la Agua mansa_\r\n(Beware of Still Water), and in a score of plays. Ticknor speaks of\r\n\"Calderón's flattery of the great\": he overlooks the social condition\r\nimplied in the title of Rojas Zorrilla's famous play, _Del Rey abajo\r\nNinguno_ (Nobody, under the King). A titular aristocracy, shorn of all\r\npower, counted for less than a foreigner can conceive in a land where\r\nhalf the population was noble, and the reverence which was centred on\r\nthe person of the Lord's anointed evolved into a profound devotion,\r\na fantastic passion as exaggerated as anything in _Amadís_. A Church\r\nwhich had inspired the seven-hundred-years' battle against the Moors,\r\nwhich had produced miracles of holiness and of genius like Santa Teresa\r\nand San Juan de la Cruz, which had stemmed the flood of the Reformation\r\nand rolled it back from the Pyrenees, was regarded as the one moral\r\nauthority, the sole possible form of religion, and as the symbol of\r\nLatin unity under Spain's headship.\r\n\r\nThe \"point of honour\"—the vengeance wrought by husbands, fathers,\r\nand brothers in the cases of women found in dubious circumstances—is\r\nharder to explain, or, at least, to justify; yet even this was a\r\nperverted outcome of chivalresque ideals, very acceptable to men who\r\nesteemed life more cheaply than their neighbours. Calderón's treatment\r\nof such a situation may be followed in FitzGerald's version of _El\r\nPintor de su Deshonra_. The husband, who has slain his wife and her\r\nlover, confronts her father and friends:—\r\n\r\nPrince.\r\n\r\n                      \"_Whoever dares\r\n  Molest him, answers it to me. Open the door.\r\n  But what is this?_      [Belardo unlocks the door.\r\n\r\nJuan (coming out).\r\n\r\n                      _A picture\r\n  Done by the Painter of his own Dishonour,\r\n  In blood.\r\n  I am Don Juan Roca. Such revenge\r\n  As each would have of me now let him take\r\n  As far as our life holds—Don Pedro, who\r\n  Gave me that lovely creature for a bride,\r\n  And I return him a bloody corpse;\r\n  Don Luis, who beholds his bosom's son\r\n  Slain by his bosom friend; and you, my lord,\r\n  Who, for your favours, might expect a piece\r\n  In some far other style than this.\r\n  Deal with me as you list; 'twill be a mercy\r\n  To swell this complement of death with mine;\r\n  For all I had to do is done, and life\r\n  Is worse than nothing now._\r\n\r\nPrince.\r\n\r\n                              _Get you to horse\r\n  And leave the wind behind you._\r\n\r\nLuis.\r\n\r\n                                _Nay, my lord;\r\n  Whom should he fly from? Not from me at least,\r\n  Who lov'd his honour as my own, and would\r\n  Myself have help'd him in a just revenge\r\n  Ev'n on an only son._\r\n\r\nPedro.\r\n\r\n                        _I cannot speak,\r\n  But I bow down these miserable grey hairs\r\n  To other arbitrament than the sword,\r\n  Ev'n to your Highness' justice._\r\n\r\nPrince.\r\n\r\n                                  _Be it so.\r\n  Meanwhile—_\r\n\r\nJuan.\r\n\r\n                      _Meanwhile, my lord, let me depart;\r\n  Free, if you will, or not. But let me go,\r\n  Nor wound these fathers with the sight of me,\r\n  Who has cut off the blossom of their age—\r\n  Yea, and his own, more miserable than them all.\r\n  They know me: that I am a gentleman,\r\n  Not cruel, nor without what seem'd due cause\r\n  Put on this bloody business of my honour;\r\n  Which having done, I will be answerable\r\n  Here and elsewhere, to all for all._\r\n\r\nPrince.\r\n\r\n                                      _Depart\r\n  In peace._\r\n\r\nJuan.\r\n\r\n            _In peace! Come, Leonelo._\"\r\n\r\nSimilar motives are used by Lope de Vega and Tirso de Molina, both\r\npriests and grey-beards; but the effect is more emphatic in Calderón,\r\nand so early as 1683 his \"immorality\" was severely censured on the\r\noccasion of Manuel de Guerra y Ribera's eulogistic _aprobación_.\r\nIn this matter, as in most others, he is satisfied to follow and\r\nto exaggerate an existing convention. His heroes are untouched by\r\nOthello's sublime jealousy: they kill their victims in cold blood as\r\nsomething due to the self-respect of gentlemen placed in an absurd\r\nposition. He rehandles the theme in _Á Secreto Agravio Secreta\r\nVenganza_ and in _El Médico de su Honra_; but the right emotion is\r\nrarely felt by the reader, since Calderón himself is seldom fired by\r\nreal passion, and writes his scene as a splendid exercise in literature.\r\n\r\nHis genius is most visible in his _autos sacramentales_, a dramatic\r\nform peculiar to Spain. The word _auto_ is first applied to any and\r\nevery play; then, the meaning becoming narrower, an _auto_ is a\r\nreligious play, resembling the mediæval Mysteries (Gil Vicente's _Auto\r\nde San Martinho_ is probably the earliest piece of this type). Finally,\r\na far more special sense is developed, and an _auto sacramental_\r\ncomes to mean a dramatised exposition of the Mystery of the Blessed\r\nEucharist, to be played in the open on Corpus Christi Day. The Dutch\r\ntraveller, Frans van Aarssens van Sommelsdijk, has left an account\r\nof the spectacle as he saw it when Calderón was in his prime. Borne\r\nin procession through the city, the Host was followed by sovereigns,\r\ncourtiers, and the multitude, with artificial giants and pasteboard\r\nmonsters—_tarascas_—at their head. Fifers, bandsmen, dancers of\r\ndecorous measures accompanied the train to the cathedral. In the\r\nafternoon the assembly met in the public square, and the _auto_ was\r\nplayed before the King, who sat beneath a canopy, the richer public,\r\nwhich lined the balconies, and the general, which filled the road.\r\nEven for an educated Protestant nothing is easier than to confound an\r\n_auto sacramental_ with a _comedia devota_ or a _comedia de santos_:\r\nthus Bouterwek, in his _History_, and Longfellow, in his _Outre-Mer_,\r\nhave mistaken the _Devoción de la Cruz_ for an _auto_. The distinction\r\nis radical. The true _auto_ has no secondary interest, has no mundane\r\npersonages: its one subject is the Eucharistic Mystery exposed by\r\nallegorical characters. Denis Florence M'Carthy's version of _Los\r\nEncantos de la Culpa_ (The Sorceries of Sin) enables English readers to\r\njudge the _genre_ for themselves:—\r\n\r\nSin.\r\n\r\n  \"_... Smell, come here, and with thy sense\r\n  Test this bread, this substance,—tell me\r\n  Is it bread or flesh?_\r\n\r\nThe Smell.\r\n\r\n                            _Its smell\r\n  Is the smell of bread._\r\n\r\nSin.\r\n\r\n                            _Taste, enter;\r\n  Try it thou._\r\n\r\nThe Taste.\r\n\r\n                _Its taste\r\n  Is plainly that of bread._\r\n\r\nSin.\r\n\r\n                      _Touch, come; why tremble?\r\n  Say what's this thou touchest._\r\n\r\nThe Touch.\r\n\r\n                                    _Bread._\r\n\r\nSin.\r\n\r\n  _Sight, declare what thou discernest\r\n  In this object._\r\n\r\nThe Sight.\r\n\r\n                  _Bread alone._\r\n\r\nSin.\r\n\r\n  _Hearing, thou, too, break in pieces\r\n  This material, which, as flesh,\r\n  Faith proclaims, and penance preacheth;\r\n  Let the fraction by its noise\r\n  Of their error undeceive them:\r\n  Say, is it so?_\r\n\r\nThe Hearing.\r\n\r\n                _Ungrateful Sin,\r\n  Though the noise in truth resembles\r\n  That of bread when broken, yet\r\n  Faith and Penance teach us better.\r\n  It is flesh, and what they call it\r\n  I believe: that Faith asserteth\r\n  Aught, is proof enough thereof._\r\n\r\nThe Understanding.\r\n\r\n _This one reason brings contentment\r\n  Unto me._\r\n\r\nPenance.\r\n\r\n            _O man, why linger,\r\n  Now that Hearing hath firm fetter'd\r\n  To the Faith thy Understanding?\r\n  Quick, regain the saving vessel\r\n  Of the sovereign Church, and leave\r\n  Sin's so highly sweet excesses.\r\n  Thou, Ulysses, Circe's slave,\r\n  Fly this false and fleeting revel,\r\n  Since, how great her power may be,\r\n  Greater is the power of Heaven,\r\n  And the true Jove's mightier magic\r\n  Will thy virtuous purpose strengthen._\r\n\r\nThe Man.\r\n\r\n  _Yes, thou'rt right, O Understanding;\r\n  Lead in safety hence my senses._\r\n\r\nAll.\r\n\r\n  _Let us to our ship; for here\r\n  All is shadowy and unsettled.\"_\r\n\r\nAs a writer of _autos_ Calderón is supreme. Lope, who outshines him\r\nat so many points, is far less dexterous than his successor when\r\nhe attempts the sacramental play. This kind of drama would almost\r\nseem created for the greater glory of Calderón. The personages\r\nof his worldly plays, and even of his _comedias devotas_, tend\r\nto become personifications of revenge, love, pride, charity, and\r\nthe rest. His set pieces are disfigured by want of humour and by\r\nover-refinement—faults which turn to virtues in the _autos_, where\r\nabstractions are wedded to the noblest poetry, where the Beyond is\r\nbrought down to earth, and where doctrinal subtleties are embellished\r\nwith miraculous ingenuity. To assert that Calderón is incomparably\r\ngreat in the _autos_ is to imply some censure of his art in his\r\nsecular dramas. The monotony and artifice of his sacramental plays\r\nmight be thought inherent to the species, were not these two notes\r\ncharacteristic of his whole theatre. Nor is it an explanation to say\r\nthat much writing of _autos_ had affected his general methods; for\r\nnot merely are the secular plays more numerous—they are also mostly\r\nearlier than the _autos_, whose real defects are a lack of dramatic\r\ninterest, an appeal to a taste so local and so temporary that they are\r\nnow as extinct in Spain as are masques in England. Still the passing\r\nfashions which produced _Comus_ in the north, and the _Encantos de la\r\nCulpa_ or the _Cena de Baltasar_ in the south, are justified to all\r\nlovers of great poetry. The _autos_ lingered on the stage till 1765,\r\nbut their genuine inspiration ended with Calderón, who, in all but a\r\nliteral sense, may be held for their creator.\r\n\r\nLope de Vega is the greatest of Spanish dramatists; Calderón is amongst\r\nthose who most nearly approach him. Lope incarnates the genius of a\r\nnation; Calderón expresses the genius of an age. He is a Spaniard to\r\nthe marrow, but a Spaniard of the seventeenth century—a courtier\r\nwith a turn for _culteranismo_, averse from the picaresque contrasts\r\nwhich lend variety to Lope's scene and to Tirso's. His interpretation\r\nof existence is so idealised that his stage becomes in some sort the\r\napotheosis of his century. His characters are not so much men and\r\nwomen, as allegorical types of men and women as Calderón conceived\r\nthem. It is not real life that he reveals, for he regarded realism as\r\nignoble and unclean: he offers in its place a brilliant pageant of\r\nabstract emotions. He is not a universal dramatist: he ranks with the\r\ngreatest writers for the Spanish stage, inasmuch as he is the greatest\r\npoet using the dramatic form. And, leaving aside his anachronisms and\r\njumblings of mythology, he is a scrupulous artist, careful of his\r\nliterary form and of his construction. The finished execution of his\r\nbest passages is so irresistible that FitzGerald declared Isabel's\r\ncharacteristic speech in the _Alcalde de Zalamea_ to be \"worthy of the\r\nGreek Antigone\":—\"Oh, never, never might the light of day arise and\r\nshow me to myself in my shame! O fleeting morning star, mightest thou\r\nnever yield to the dawn that even now presses on thine azure skirts!\r\nAnd thou, great Orb of all, do thou stay down in the cold ocean foam;\r\nlet Night for once advance her trembling empire into thine! For once\r\nassert thy voluntary power to hear and pity human misery and prayer,\r\nnor hasten up to proclaim the vilest deed that Heaven, in revenge on\r\nman, has written on his guilty annals. Alas! even as I speak, thou\r\nliftest thy bright, inexorable face above the hills.\" Contrast with\r\nthis impassioned lament (a little toned down in FitzGerald's version)\r\nthe aphoristic wisdom of Pedro Crespo's counsel to his son in the same\r\nplay:—\"Thou com'st of honourable if of humble stock; bear both in\r\nmind, so as neither to be daunted from trying to rise, nor puffed up so\r\nas to be sure to fall. How many have done away the memory of a defect\r\nby carrying themselves modestly, while others, again, have gotten a\r\nblemish only by being too proud of being born without one. There is a\r\njust humility that will maintain thine own dignity, and yet make thee\r\ninsensible to many a rub that galls the proud spirit. Be courteous in\r\nthy manner, and liberal of thy purse; for 'tis the hand to the bonnet,\r\nand in the pocket, that makes friends in this world, of which to gain\r\none good, all the gold the sun breeds in India, or the universal sea\r\nsucks down, were a cheap purchase. Speak no evil of women; I tell thee\r\nthe meanest of them deserves our respect; for of women do we not all\r\ncome? Quarrel with no one but with good cause.... I trust in God to\r\nlive to see thee home again with honour and advancement on thy back.\"\r\n\r\nHad Calderón always maintained this level, he would be classed with\r\nthe first masters of all ages and all countries. His blood, his\r\nfaith, his environment were limitations which prevented his becoming\r\na world-poet; his majesty, his devout lyrism, his decorative fantasy\r\nsuffice to place him in the foremost file of national poets. But he\r\nwas not so national that foreign adaptors left him untouched: thus\r\nD'Ouville annexed the _Dama Duende_ under the title of _L'Esprit\r\nfollet_, which reappears as Killigrew's _Parson's Wedding_; thus\r\nDryden's _Evening's Love_ is Calderón done from Corneille's French;\r\nthus Wycherley's _Gentleman Dancing Master_ derives from _El Maestro de\r\ndanzar_. Yet, though Calderón's plots may be conveyed, his substance\r\ncannot be denationalised, being, as he is, the sublimest Catholic\r\npoet, as Catholicism and poetry were understood by the Spaniards of\r\nthe seventeenth century: a local genius of intensely local savour,\r\nexercising his dramatic in local forms.\r\n\r\nArchbishop Trench has suggested that in the three great theatres of the\r\nworld the best period covers little more than a century, and he proves\r\nhis thesis by a reference to dates. Æschylus was born B.C. 525, and\r\nEuripides died B.C. 406: Marlowe was born in 1564, and Shirley died in\r\n1666: Lope was born in 1562, and Calderón died in 1681. With Calderón\r\nthe heroic age of the Spanish theatre reached a splendid close.\r\nHe chanced to outlive his Toledan contemporary, FRANCISCO DE ROJAS\r\nZORRILLA (1607-? 1661), from whose _Traición busca el Castigo_ Le Sage\r\nhas arranged his _Traître puni_, and Vanbrugh his _False Friend_. A\r\ncourtly poet, and a Commander of the Order of Santiago, Rojas Zorrilla\r\ncollaborated with fashionable writers like Vélez de Guevara, Mira de\r\nAmescua, and Calderón, of whom he is accounted a disciple, though his\r\none great tragedy has real individual power. His two volumes of plays\r\n(1640, 1645) reveal him as a most ingenious dramatist, who carries\r\nthe \"point of honour\" further than Calderón in his best known play,\r\n_Del Rey abajo ninguno_, a characteristically Spanish piece. García\r\nde Castañar, apparently a peasant living near Toledo, subscribes so\r\ngenerously to the funds for the expedition to Algeciras that King\r\nAlfonso XI. resolves to visit him in disguise. García gets wind of\r\nthis, and receives his guests honourably, mistaking Mendo for Alfonso.\r\nMendo conceives a passion for Blanca, García's wife, and is discovered\r\nby the husband at Blanca's door. As the King is inviolate for a\r\nsubject, García resolves to slay Blanca, who escapes to court. García\r\nis summoned by the King, finds his mistake, settles matters by slaying\r\nMendo in the palace, and explains to his sovereign (and his audience)\r\nthat _none under the King_ can affront him with impunity. Rojas\r\nZorrilla's style occasionally inclines to _culteranismo_; but this is\r\nan obvious concession to popular taste, his true manner being direct\r\nand energetic. His clever construction and witty dialogue are best\r\nstudied in _Lo que son Mujeres_ (What Women are) and in _Entre Bobos\r\nanda el Juego_ (The Boobies' Sport).\r\n\r\nA very notable talent is that of AGUSTÍN MORETO Y CAVAÑA (1618-69),\r\nwhose popularity as a writer of cloak-and-sword plays is only less than\r\nLope's. In 1639 Moreto graduated as a licentiate in arts at Alcalá de\r\nHenares. Thence he made his way to Madrid, where he found a protector\r\nin Calderón. He published a volume of plays in 1654, and is believed to\r\nhave taken orders three years later. Moreto is not a great inventor,\r\nbut so far as concerns stagecraft he is above all contemporaries. In\r\n_El Desdén con el Desdén_ (Scorn for Scorn) he borrows Lope's _Milagros\r\ndel Desprecio_ (Scorn works Wonders), and it is fair to say that the\r\n_rifacimento_ excels the original at every point. Diana, daughter of\r\nthe Conde de Barcelona, mocks at marriage: her father surrounds her\r\nwith the neighbouring gallants, among whom is the Conde de Urgel.\r\nUrgel's affected coolness piques the lady into a resolve to captivate\r\nhim, and she so far succeeds as to lead him to avow his love for her:\r\nhe escapes rejection by feigning that his declaration was a jest,\r\nand the dramatic solution is brought about by Diana's surrender. The\r\nplot is ordered with consummate skill, the dialogue is of the gayest\r\nhumour, the characters more life-like than any but Alarcón's; and\r\nas evidence of the playwright's tact, it is enough to say that when\r\nMolière, in his _Princesse d'Élide_, strove to repeat Moreto's exploit\r\nhe met with ignominious disaster. In the delicacy of touch with which\r\nMoreto handles a humorous situation he is almost unrivalled; and in the\r\nbroader spirit of farce, his _graciosos_—comic characters, generally\r\nbody-servants to the heroes—are admirable for natural force and for\r\ngusts of spontaneous wit. In _El lindo Don Diego_ he has fixed the type\r\nof the fop convinced that he is irresistible, and the presentation\r\nof fatuity which leads Don Diego into marriage with a serving-wench\r\n(whom he mistakes for a countess) is among the few masterpieces of high\r\ncomedy. Moreto's historical plays are of less universal interest; in\r\nthis kind, _El Rico Hombre de Alcalá_ is a powerful and sympathetic\r\npicture of Pedro the Cruel—the strong man doing justice on the noble,\r\nTello García—from the standpoint of the Spanish populace, which\r\nhas ever respected _el Rey justiciero_. In his later years Moreto\r\nbetook him to the _comedia devota_; his _San Francisco de Sena_ is\r\nextravagantly and almost ludicrously devout, as in the scenes where\r\nFrancisco wagers his eyes, loses, is struck blind, and repents on\r\nrecovering his sight. The devout play was not Moreto's calling: in his\r\nfirst and best manner, as a master of the lighter, gayer comedy, he\r\nholds his own against all Spain.\r\n\r\nAmong the followers of Calderón are Antonio Cuello (d. 1652), who is\r\nreported to have collaborated with Felipe IV. in _El Conde de Essex_;\r\nÁlvaro Cubillo de Aragón (fl. 1664), whose _Perfecta Casada_ is a\r\ngood piece of work; Juan Matos Fragoso (? 1614-92), who borrowed and\r\nplagiarised with successful audacity; but these, with many others,\r\nare mere imitators, and the Spanish theatre declines lower and lower,\r\ntill in the hands of Carlos II.'s favourite, Francisco Antonio Bances\r\nCandamo (1662-1704), it reaches its nadir. The last good playwright of\r\nthe classic age is ANTONIO DE SOLÍS Y RIVADENEIRA (1610-86), who, by\r\nthe accident of his long life, lends a ray of renown to the deplorable\r\nreign of Carlos II. His dramas are excellent in construction and\r\nphrasing, and his _Amor al uso_ was popular in France through Thomas\r\nCorneille's adaptation.\r\n\r\nBut his title to fame rests, not on verse, but on prose. His _Historia\r\nde la Conquista de Méjico_ (1684) is a most distinguished performance,\r\neven if we compare it with Mariana's. Seeing that Solís lived through\r\nthe worst periods of Gongorism, his style is a marvel of purity,\r\nthough a difficult critic might well condemn its cloying suavity.\r\nStill, his work has never been displaced since its first appearance,\r\nfor it deals with a very picturesque period, is eloquent and clear,\r\nand is almost excessively patriotic in tone and spirit. Gibbon, in his\r\nsixty-second chapter, mentions \"an Aragonese history which I have read\r\nwith pleasure\"—the _Expedición de los catalanes y aragoneses contra\r\nturcos y griegos_ by Francisco de Moncada, Conde de Osuna (1586-1635).\r\n\"He never quotes his authorities,\" adds Gibbon; and, in fact, Moncada\r\nmostly translates from Ramón Muntaner's Catalan _Crónica_, though he\r\ntranslates in excellent fashion. Diego de Saavedra Fajardo (1584-1648)\r\nwrites with force and ease in his uncritical _Corona Gótica_, and in\r\nhis more interesting literary review, the _República literaria_; his\r\nfreedom from Gongorism is explained by the fact that he passed most\r\nof his life out of Spain. The Portuguese, FRANCISCO MANUEL DE MELO\r\n(1611-66), is ill represented by his _Historia de los Movimientos,\r\nSeparación y Guerra de Cataluña_ (1645), where he is given over to both\r\nGongorism and _conceptismo_: in his native tongue—as in his _Apologos\r\nDialogaes_—he writes with simplicity, strength, and wit. Melo's life\r\nwas unlucky: when he was not being shipwrecked, he was in jail on\r\nsuspicion of being a murderer; and being out of jail, he was exiled\r\nto Brazil. His reward is posthumous: both Portuguese and Spaniards\r\nhold him for a classic, and Sr. Menéndez y Pelayo even compares him to\r\nQuevedo.\r\n\r\nAnother man of Portuguese birth has won immortality outside of\r\nliterature; yet there is ground for thinking that DIEGO RODRÍGUEZ\r\nDE SILVA Y VELÁZQUEZ (1599-1660) had the sense for language as for\r\npaint. His _Memoria de las Pinturas_ (1658) exists in an unique\r\ncopy published at Rome under the name of his pupil, Juan de Alfaro,\r\nthough its substance is unscrupulously embodied in Francisco de\r\nlos Santos' _Descripción Breve_ of the Escorial. Formally, it is\r\na catalogue; substantially, it expresses the artist's judgment on\r\nhis great predecessors. Thus, of Paolo Veronese's _Wedding Feast_\r\nhe writes:—\"There are admirable heads, and almost all of them seem\r\nportraits. Not that of the Virgin: she has more reserve, more divinity:\r\nthough very beautiful, she corresponds fittingly to the age of Christ,\r\nwho is beside her—a point which most artists overlook, for they\r\npaint Christ as a man, and His Mother as a girl.\" The great realist\r\nspeaks once more in describing Veronese's _Purification_:—\"The Virgin\r\nkneels ... holding on a white cloth the Child—naked, beautiful, and\r\ntender—with a restlessness so suited to his age that He seems more\r\na piece of living flesh than something painted.\" And, in the same\r\nspirit, he writes of Tintoretto's _Washing of the Feet_:—\"It is hard\r\nto believe that one is looking at a painting. Such is the truth of\r\ncolour, such the exactness of perspective, that one might think to go\r\nin and walk on the pavement, tessellated with stones of divers colours,\r\nwhich, diminishing in size, make the room seem larger, and lead you to\r\nbelieve that there is atmosphere between each figure. The table, seats\r\n(and a dog which is worked in) are truth, not paint.... Once for all,\r\nany picture placed beside it looks like something expressed in terms of\r\ncolour, and this seems all the truer.\" Strangely enough, this writing\r\nof Velázquez is ignored by most, perhaps by all, of his biographers;\r\nyet it deserves a passing reference as a model of energetic expression\r\nin a time when most professional men of letters were Gongorists or\r\n_conceptistas_.\r\n\r\nA certain directness of style is found in Gerónimo de Alcalá Yañez y\r\nRibera's _Alonso, Mozo de muchos Amos_ (1625), in Alonso de Castillo\r\nSolórzano's _Garduña de Seville_ (the Seville Weasel, 1634), in the\r\n_Siglo Pitagórico_ (1644) of the Segovian Jew, Antonio Enríquez Gómez,\r\nand in the half-true, half-invented _Vida y Hechos de Estebanillo\r\nGonzález_ (1646)—all picaresque tales, clever, amusing, and\r\nimproper, on the approved pattern. But the pest of preciosity spread\r\nto fiction, is conspicuous in the _Español Gerardo_ of Gonzalo de\r\nCéspedes y Meneses, and steadily degenerates till it becomes arrant\r\nnonsense in the _Varios Efectos de Amor_ (1641) of Alonso de Alcalá y\r\nHerrera—five stories, in each of which one of the vowels is omitted.\r\nAlcalá, however, had neither talent nor influence. The Aragonese\r\nJesuit, BALTASAR GRACIÁN (1601-58), had both, and his vogue is proved\r\nby numerous editions, by translations, by such references as that\r\nin the _Entretiens_ of Bouhours, who proclaims him \"_le sublime_.\"\r\nAddison thrice mentions him with respect in the _Spectator_, and it\r\nis suggested that Rycaut's rendering of the _Criticón_ may have given\r\nDefoe the idea of Man Friday. In the present century Schopenhauer vowed\r\nthat the _Criticón_ was \"one of the best books in the world,\" and Sir\r\nMountstuart Grant Duff, taking his cue from Schopenhauer, has extolled\r\nGracián with some vehemence.\r\n\r\nGracián seems to have been indifferent to popularity, and his works,\r\npublished somewhat against his will by his friend, Vincencio Juan de\r\nLastanosa, were mostly issued under the name of Lorenzo Gracián. His\r\nfirst work was _El Héroe_ (1630), an ideal rendering of the Happy\r\nWarrior, as _El Discreto_ (1647) is the ideal of the Politic Courtier;\r\nmore important than either is the _Agudeza y Arte de Ingenio_ (1642),\r\na _conceptista_ Art of Rhetoric, of singular learning, subtlety, and\r\ncatholic taste. The three parts of the _Criticón_, which appeared\r\nbetween 1650 and 1653, correspond to \"the spring of childhood,\" \"the\r\nsummer of youth,\" and \"the autumn of manhood.\" In this allegory of life\r\nthe shipwrecked Critilo meets the wild man Andrenio, who finally learns\r\nSpanish and reveals his soul to Critilo, whom he accompanies to Spain,\r\nwhere he communes with both allegorical figures and real personages\r\non all manner of philosophic questions. The general tone of the\r\n_Criticón_ goes far towards explaining Schopenhauer's admiration; for\r\nthe Spaniard is no less a woman-hater, is no less bitter, sarcastic,\r\ndenunciatory, and pessimistic than the German. Gracián, to use his own\r\nphrase, \"flaunts his unhappiness as a trophy\" in phrases whose laboured\r\ningenuity begins by impressing, and ends by fatiguing, the reader.\r\n\r\nIt is difficult to believe that Gracián's attitude towards life is more\r\nthan a pose; but the pose is dignified, and he puts the pessimistic\r\ncase with vigour and skill. His _Oráculo Manual ó Arte de Prudencia_\r\n(1653), a reduction of his gospel to the form of maxims, has found\r\nadmirers (and even an excellent translator in the person of Mr.\r\nJoseph Jacobs). The reflection is always acute, and seems at whiles\r\nto anticipate the thought of La Rochefoucauld—doubtless because\r\nboth drew from common sources; but though the doctrine and spirit\r\nbe almost identical, Gracián nowhere approaches La Rochefoucauld's\r\nmetallic brilliancy and concise perfection. He is not content to\r\ndeliver his maxim, and have done with it: he adds—so to say—elaborate\r\npostscripts and epigrammatic amplifications, which debase the maxim\r\nto a platitude. Mr. John Morley's remark, that \"some of his aphorisms\r\ngive a neat turn to a commonplace,\" is scarcely too severe. Yet one\r\ncannot choose but think that Gracián was superior to his work. He had\r\nit in him to be as good a writer as he was a keen observer, and in\r\nmany passages, when he casts his affectations from him, his expression\r\nis as lucid and as strong as may be; but he would posture, would be\r\nparadoxical to avoid being trite, would bewilder with his conceit and\r\nlearning, would try to pack more meaning into words than words will\r\ncarry. No man ever wrote with more care and scruple, with more ambition\r\nto excel according to the formulæ of a fashionable school, with more\r\nscorn for Gongorism and all its work. Still, though he avoided the\r\noffence of obscure language, he sinned most grievously by obscurity of\r\nthought, and he is now forgotten by all but students, who look upon him\r\nas a chief among the wrong-headed, misguided _conceptistas_.\r\n\r\nA last faint breath of mysticism is found in the _Tratado de la\r\nHermosura de Dios_ (1641) by the Jesuit, Juan Eusebio Nieremberg\r\n(1590-1658), whose prose, though elegant and relatively pure, lacks the\r\nmajesty of Luis de León's and the persuasiveness of Granada's. More\r\nfamiliar in style, the letters of Felipe IV.'s friend, María Coronel\r\ny Arana (1602-65), known in religion as Sor MARÍA DE JESÚS DE ÁGREDA,\r\nmay still be read with pleasure. Professed at sixteen, she was elected\r\nabbess of her convent at twenty-five, and her _Mística Ciudad de Dios_\r\nhas gone through innumerable editions in almost all languages; her\r\n_Correspondencia con Felipe IV._ extends over twenty-two years, from\r\n1643 onwards, and is as remarkable for its profound piety as for its\r\nsound appreciation of public affairs. The common interest of King and\r\nnun began with the doctrine of the Immaculate Conception, which both\r\ndesired to have defined as an article of faith; domestic and foreign\r\npolitics come under discussion later, and it soon becomes plain that\r\nthe nun is the man. While Felipe IV. weakly laments that \"the Cortes\r\nare seeking places, taking no more notice of the insurrection than\r\nif the enemy were at the Philippines,\" Sor María de Jesús strives to\r\nsteady him, to lend him something of her own strong will, by urging\r\nhim to \"be a King,\" \"to do his duty.\" There is a curious reference to\r\nthe passing of Cromwell—\"the enemy of our faith and kingdom, the only\r\nperson whose death I ever desired, or ever prayed to God for.\" Her\r\npractical advice fell on deaf ears, and when she died, no man seemed\r\nleft in Spain to realise that the country was slowly bleeding to death,\r\nbecoming a cypher in politics, in art, in letters.\r\n\r\nOne single ecclesiastic rises above his fellows during the ruinous\r\nreign of Carlos the Bewitched, and his renown is greater out of Spain\r\nthan in it. MIGUEL DE MOLINOS (1627-97), the founder of Quietism, was a\r\nnative of Muniesa, near Zaragoza; was educated by the Jesuits; and held\r\na living at Valencia. He journeyed to Rome in 1665, won vast esteem as\r\na confessor, and there, in 1675, published his famous _Spiritual Guide_\r\nin Italian. Mr. Shorthouse, an English apostle of Quietism, mentions a\r\nSpanish rendering which \"won such popularity in his native country that\r\nsome are still found who declare that the Spanish version is earlier\r\nthan the Italian.\" It is almost certain that Molinos wrote in Spanish,\r\nand to judge by the translations, he must have written with admirable\r\nforce. But, as a matter of fact, no Spanish version was ever popular\r\nin Spain, for the reason that none has ever existed. This is not the\r\nplace to discuss the personal character of Molinos, who stands accused\r\nof grave crimes; nor to weigh the value of his teaching, nor to follow\r\nits importation into France by Mme. de la Mothe Guyon; nor to look into\r\nthe controversy which wrecked Fénelon's career. Still it should be\r\nnoted as characteristic of Carlos II.'s reign, that a book by one of\r\nhis subjects was influencing all Europe without any man in Spain being\r\naware of it.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[26] According to Lope de Vega, the word _culteranismo_ was invented by\r\nJiménez Patón, Villamediana's tutor.\r\n\r\n[27] See M. Farinelli's learned study, _Don Giovanni: Note critiche_\r\n(Torino, 1896), pp. 37-39.\r\n\r\n[28] Cp. Mr. Norman MacColl's _Select Plays of Calderón_ (London,\r\n1888), pp. xxvi.-xxx., and Gallardo's _Ensayo de una Biblioteca\r\nEspañola_ (Madrid, 1866), vol. ii. col. 367, 368.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER XI\r\n\r\n                        THE AGE OF THE BOURBONS\r\n\r\n                               1700-1808\r\n\r\n\r\nLetters, arts, and even rational politics, practically died in Spain\r\nduring the reign of Carlos II. Good work was done in serious branches\r\nof study: in history by Gaspar Ibáñez de Segovia Peralta y Mendoza,\r\nMarqués de Mondéjar; in bibliography by Nicolás Antonio; in law by\r\nFrancisco Ramos del Manzano; in mathematics by Hugo de Omerique,\r\nwhose analytic gifts won the applause of Newton. But all the rest was\r\nneglected while the King was exorcised, and was forced to swallow a\r\nquart of holy oil as a counter-charm against the dead men's brains\r\ngiven him (as it was alleged) by his mother in a cup of chocolate. Nor\r\ndid the nightmare lift with his death on November 1, 1700: the War\r\nof the Succession lasted till the signing of the Utrecht Treaty in\r\n1713. The new sovereign, Felipe V., grandson of Louis XIV., interested\r\nhimself in the progress of his people; and being a Frenchman of his\r\ntime, he believed in the centralisation of learning. His chief ally was\r\nthat Marqués de Villena familiar to all readers of St. Simon as the\r\nmajor-domo who used his wand upon Cardinal Alberoni's skull:—\"Il lève\r\nson petit bâton et le laisse tomber de toute sa force dru et menu sur\r\nles oreilles du cardinal, en l'appelant petit coquin, petit faquin,\r\npetit impudent qui ne méritoit que les étrivières.\" But even St. Simon\r\nadmits Villena's rare qualities:—\"Il savoit beaucoup, et il étoit\r\nde toute sa vie en commerce avec la plupart de tous les savants des\r\ndivers pays de l'Europe.... C'était un homme bon, doux, honnête, sensé\r\n... enfin l'honneur, la probité, la valeur, la vertu même.\" In 1711\r\nthe Biblioteca Nacional was founded; in 1714 the Spanish Academy of\r\nthe Language was established, with Villena as \"director,\" and soon set\r\nto earnest work. The only good lexicon published since Nebrija's was\r\nSebastián de Covarrubias y Horozco's _Tesoro de la Lengua castellana_\r\n(1611): under Villena's guidance the Academy issued the six folios\r\nof its Dictionary, commonly called the _Diccionario de Autoridades_\r\n(1726-39). Accustomed to his Littré, his Grimm, to the scientific\r\nmethods of MM. Arsène Darmesteter, Hatzfeld, and Thomas, and to that\r\nmonumental work now publishing at the Clarendon Press, the modern\r\nstudent is too prone to dwell on the defects—manifest enough—of the\r\nSpanish Academy's Dictionary. Yet it was vastly better than any other\r\nthen existing in Europe, is still of unique value to scholars, and was\r\nso much too good for its age that, in 1780, it was cut down to one poor\r\nvolume. The foundation of the Academy of History, under Agustín de\r\nMontiano, in 1738, is another symptom of French authority.\r\n\r\nMr. Gosse and Dr. Garnett, in previous volumes of the present series,\r\nhave justly emphasised the predominance of French methods both in\r\nEnglish and Italian literature during the eighteenth century. In\r\nGermany the French sympathies of Frederick the Great and of Wieland\r\nwere to be no less obvious. Sooner or later, it was inevitable that\r\nSpain should undergo the French influence; yet, though the French\r\nnationality of the King is a factor to be taken into account, his\r\nshare in the literary revolution is too often exaggerated. Long before\r\nFelipe V. was born Spaniards had begun to interest themselves in\r\nFrench literature. Thus Quevedo, who translated the _Introduction à\r\nla Vie Dévote_ of St. François de Sales, showed himself familiar with\r\nthe writings of a certain Miguel de Montaña, more recognisable as\r\nMichel de Montaigne. Juan Bautista Diamante, apparently ignorant of\r\nGuillén de Castro's play, translated Corneille's _Cid_ under the title\r\nof _El Honrador de su padre_ (1658); and in March 1680 an anonymous\r\narrangement of the _Bourgeois Gentilhomme_ was given at the Buen Retiro\r\nunder the title of _El Labrador Gentilhombre_. Still more significant\r\nis an incident recalled by Sr. Menéndez y Pelayo: the staging of\r\nCorneille's _Rodogune_ and Molière's _Les Femmes Savantes_ at Lima,\r\nabout the year 1710, in Castilian versions, made by Pedro de Peralta\r\nBarnuevo. Compared with this, the Madrid translations of Corneille's\r\n_Cinna_ and of Racine's _Iphigénie_, by Francisco de Pizarro y\r\nPiccolomini, Marqués de San Juan (1713), and by José de Cañizares\r\n(1716), are of small moment. The latter performances may very well have\r\nbeen due in great part to the personal influence of the celebrated\r\nMadame des Ursins, an active French agent at the Spanish court.\r\n\r\nReaders curious as to the Spanish poets of the eighteenth century\r\nmay turn with confidence to the masterly and exhaustive _Historia\r\nCrítica_ of the Marqués de Valmar. Their number may be inferred from\r\nthis detail: that more than one hundred and fifty competed at a poetic\r\njoust held in honour of St. Aloysius Gonzaga and St. Stanislaus\r\nKostka in 1727. But none of all the tribe is of real importance. It\r\nis enough to mention the names of Juan José de Salazar y Hontiveros,\r\na priestly copromaniac, like his contemporary, Swift; of José León y\r\nMansilla, who wrote a third _Soledad_ in continuation of Góngora; and\r\nof Sor María del Cielo, a mild practitioner in lyrical mysticism. A\r\nlittle later there follow Gabriel Álvarez de Toledo, a representative\r\n_conceptista_; Eugenio Gerardo Lobo, a romantic soldier with a craze\r\nfor versifying; Diego de Torres y Villarroel, an encyclopædic professor\r\nat Salamanca, who, half-knowing everything from the cedar by Lebanon\r\nto the hyssop that groweth on the wall, showed critical insight by the\r\ncontempt in which he held his own rhymes. The Carmelite, Fray Juan de\r\nla Concepción, a Gongorist of the straitest sect, was the idol of his\r\ngeneration, and proved his quality, when he was elected to the Academy\r\nin 1744, by returning thanks in a rhymed speech: an innovation which\r\nscandalised his brethren, and has never been repeated.\r\n\r\nA head and shoulders over these rises the figure of IGNACIO DE LUZÁN\r\nCLARAMUNT DE SUELVES Y GURREA (1702-54), who, spending his youth in\r\nItaly, was—so it is believed—a pupil of Giovanni Battista Vico at\r\nNaples, where he remained during eighteen years. For his century,\r\nLuzán's equipment was considerable. His Greek and Latin were of the\r\nbest; Italian was almost his native tongue; he read Descartes and\r\nepitomised the Port-Royal treatise on logic; he was versed in German,\r\nand, meeting with _Paradise Lost_—probably during his residence as\r\nSecretary to the Embassy in Paris (1747-50)—he first revealed Milton\r\nto Spain by translating select passages into prose. His verses,\r\noriginal and translated, are insignificant, though, as an instance of\r\nhis French taste, his version of Lachaussée's _Préjugé à la Mode_ is\r\nworthy of notice: not so the four books of his _Poética_ (1737). So\r\nearly as 1728, Luzán prepared six _Ragionamenti sopra la poesia_ for\r\nthe Palermo Academy, and on his return to Spain in 1733 he re-arranged\r\nhis treatise in Castilian. The _Poética_ avowedly aims at \"subjecting\r\nSpanish verse to the rules which obtain among cultured nations\"; and\r\nthough its basis is Lodovico Muratori's _Della perfetta poesia_, with\r\nsuggestions borrowed from Vincenzo Gravina and Giovanni Crescimbeni,\r\nthe general drift of Luzán's teaching coincides with that of French\r\ndoctrinaires like Rapin, Boileau, and Le Bossu. It seems probable that\r\nhis views became more and more French with time, for the posthumous\r\nreprint of the _Poética_ (1789) shows an increase of anti-national\r\nspirit; but on this point it is hard to judge, inasmuch as his pupil\r\nand editor, Eugenio de Llaguno y Amírola (a strong French partisan, who\r\ntranslated Racine's _Athalie_ in 1754), is suspected of tampering with\r\nthis text, as he adulterated that of Díaz Gámez' _Crónica del Conde de\r\nBuelna_.\r\n\r\nLuzán's destructive criticisms are always acute, and are generally\r\njust. Lope is for him a genius of amazing force and variety, while\r\nCalderón is a singer of exquisite music. With this ingratiating\r\nprelude, he has no difficulty in exposing their most obvious defects,\r\nand his attack on Gongorism is delivered with great spirit. It is in\r\nconstruction that he fails: as when he avers that the ends of poetry\r\nand moral philosophy are identical, that Homer was a didactic poet\r\nexpounding political and transcendental truths to the vulgar, that\r\nepics exist for the instruction of monarchs and military chiefs, that\r\nthe period of a play's action should correspond precisely with the time\r\nthat the play takes in acting. Luzán's rigorous logic ends by reducing\r\nto absurdity the didactic theories of the eighteenth century; yet, for\r\nall his logic, he had a genuine love of poetry, which induced him\r\nto neglect his abstract rules. It is true that he scarcely utters a\r\nproposition which is not contradicted by implication in other parts\r\nof his treatise. Nevertheless, his book has both a literary and an\r\nhistoric value. Written in excellent style and temper, with innumerable\r\nparallels from many literatures, the _Poética_ served as a manifesto\r\nwhich summoned Spain to fall into line with academic Europe; and Spain,\r\namong the least academic because among the most original of countries,\r\nended by obeying. Her old inspiration had passed away with her wide\r\ndominion, and Luzán deserves credit for lending her a new opportune\r\nimpulse.\r\n\r\nHe was not to win without a battle. The official licensers,\r\nManuel Gallinero and Miguel Navarro, took public objection to the\r\nretrospective application of his doctrines, and a louder note of\r\nopposition was sounded in a famous quarterly, the _Diario de los\r\nLiteratos de España_, founded in 1737 by Juan Martínez Salafranca and\r\nLeopoldo Gerónimo Puig. Though the _Diario_ was patronised by Felipe\r\nV., though its judgments are now universally accepted, it came before\r\nits time: the bad authors whom it victimised combined against it, and,\r\nas the public remained indifferent, the review was soon suspended.\r\nEven among the contributors to the _Diario_, Luzán found an ally in\r\nthe person of the clerical lawyer, JOSÉ GERARDO DE HERVÁS Y COBO DE\r\nLA TORRE (d. 1742), author of the popular _Sátira contra los malos\r\nEscritores de su Tiempo_. Hervás, who took the pseudonym of Jorge\r\nPitillas, wrote with boldness, with critical sense, with an ease and\r\npoint and grace which engraved his verse upon the general memory; so\r\nthat to this day many of his lines are as familiar to Spaniards as\r\nare Pope's to Englishmen. They err who hold with Ticknor that Hervás\r\nimitated Persius and Juvenal: in style and doctrine his immediate\r\nmodel was Boileau, whom he adapts with rare skill, and without any\r\nacknowledgment. He carries a step further the French doctrines,\r\ninsinuated rather than proclaimed in the _Poética_, and, though he was\r\nnot an avowed propagandist, his sarcastic epigrams perhaps did more\r\nthan any formal treatise to popularise the new doctrines.\r\n\r\nA reformer on the same lines was the Benedictine, BENITO GERÓNIMO\r\nFEIJÓO Y MONTENEGRO (1675-1764), whose _Teatro crítico_ and _Cartas\r\neruditas y curiosas_ were as successful in Spain as were the _Tatler_\r\nand _Spectator_ in England. Feijóo's style is laced with Gallicisms,\r\nand his vain, insolent airs of infallibility are antipathetic; yet\r\nthough his admirers have made him ridiculous by calling him \"the\r\nSpanish Voltaire,\" his intellectual curiosity, his cautious scepticism,\r\nhis lucid intelligence, his fine scent for a superstitious fallacy,\r\nplace him among the best writers of his age. A happy instance of his\r\nskill in exposing a paradox is his indictment of Rousseau's _Discours\r\nsur les Sciences et les Arts_. His rancorous tongue raised up crowds\r\nof enemies, who scrupled not to circulate vague rumours as to his\r\nheretical tendencies: in fact, his orthodoxy was as unimpeachable as\r\nwere the services which he rendered to his country's enlightenment.\r\nHis cause, and the cause of learning generally, were championed\r\nby the Galician, Pedro José García y Balboa, best known as MARTÍN\r\nSARMIENTO (1695-1772), the name which he bore in the Benedictine order.\r\nSarmiento's erudition is at least equal to Feijóo's, and his industry\r\nis matched by the variety of his interests. As a botanist he won the\r\nadmiration and friendship of Linné; Feijóo's _Teatro crítico_ owes\r\nmuch to his unselfish supervision; yet, while his name was esteemed\r\nthroughout Europe, he shrank from domestic criticism, and withheld his\r\nmiscellaneous works from the press. He owes his place in literature\r\nto his posthumous _Memorias para la historia de la Poesía y Poetas\r\nespañoles_, which, despite its excessive local patriotism, is not only\r\nremarkable for its shrewd insight, but forms the point of departure\r\nfor all later studies. Not less useful was the life's work of GREGORIO\r\nMAYÁNS Y SISCAR (1699-1781), who was the first to print Juan de Valdés'\r\n_Diálogo de la Lengua_, who was the first biographer of Cervantes, and\r\nwho edited Luis Vives, Luis de León, Mondéjar, and others. Though much\r\nof Mayáns' writing has grown obsolete in its methods, he is honourably\r\nremembered as a pioneer, and his _Orígenes de la Lengua castellana_ is\r\nfull of wise suggestion and acute divination.\r\n\r\nProminent among Luzán's followers in the self-constituted Academia\r\ndel Buen Gusto is BLAS ANTONIO NASARRE Y FÉRRIZ (1689-1751), an\r\nindustrious, learned polygraph who carried party spirit so far as to\r\nreproduce Avellaneda's spurious _Don Quixote_ (1732), on the specific\r\nground that it was in every way superior to the genuine sequel.\r\nCervantes, indeed, was an object of pitying contempt to Nasarre, who,\r\nwhen he reprinted Cervantes' plays in 1749, contended that they not\r\nonly were the worst ever written, but that they were a heap of follies\r\ndeliberately invented to burlesque Lope de Vega's theatre. Of the same\r\nschool is Lope's merciless foe, AGUSTÍN MONTIANO Y LUYANDO (1697-1765),\r\nauthor of two poor tragedies, the _Virginia_ and the _Ataulfo_,\r\nmodels of dull academic correctness. Yet he found an illustrious\r\nadmirer in the person of Lessing, who, by his panegyric on Montiano\r\nin the _Theatralische Bibliotek_, remains as a standing example of\r\nthe fallibility of the greatest critics when they pronounce judgment\r\non foreign literatures. Even more exaggerated than Montiano was the\r\nMarqués de Valdeflores, LUIS JOSÉ VELÁZQUEZ DE VELASCO (1722-72),\r\nwhom we have already seen ascribing Torre's poems to Quevedo, an\r\nerror almost sufficient to ruin any reputation. Velázquez expressed\r\nhis general literary views in his _Orígenes de la Poesía castellana_\r\n(1749), which found an enthusiastic translator in Johann Andreas Dieze,\r\nof Göttingen. Velázquez develops and emphasises the teaching of his\r\npredecessors, denounces the dramatic follies of Lope and Calderón, and\r\neven goes so far as to regret that Nasarre should waste his powder\r\non two common, discredited fellows like Lope and Cervantes. It is\r\nimpossible for us here to record the polemics in which Luzán's teaching\r\nwas supported or combated; defective as it was, it had at least the\r\nmerit of rousing Spain from her intellectual torpor.\r\n\r\nSome effect of the new criticism is seen in the works of the Jesuit,\r\nJOSÉ FRANCISCO DE ISLA (1703-81), whose finer humour is displayed in\r\nhis _Triunfo del Amor y de la Lealtad_ (1746), which professes to\r\ndescribe the proclamation at Pamplona of Ferdinand VI.'s accession.\r\nThe author was officially thanked by Council and Chapter, and some\r\nexpressed by gifts their gratitude for his handsome treatment. As\r\nBasques joke with difficulty, it was not until two months later that\r\nthe _Triunfo_ (which bears the alternative title of _A Great Day for\r\nNavarre_) was suspected to be a burlesque of the proceedings and all\r\nconcerned in them. Isla kept his countenance while he assured his\r\nvictims of his entire good faith; the latter, however, expressed\r\ntheir slow-witted indignation in print, and brought such pressure to\r\nbear that the lively Jesuit—who kept up the farce of denial till the\r\nlast day of his life—was removed from Pamplona by his superiors.\r\nThe incorrigible wag departed to become a fashionable preacher; but\r\nhis sense of humour accompanied him to church, and was displayed at\r\nthe cost of his brethren. Paravicino, as we have already observed,\r\nintroduced Gongorism into the pulpit, and his lead was followed by\r\nmen of lesser faculty, who reproduced \"the contortions of the Sibyl\r\nwithout her inspiration.\" By degrees preaching almost grew to be a\r\nsynonym for buffoonery, and by the middle of the eighteenth century\r\nit was as often as not an occasion for the vulgar profanity which\r\npleases devout illiterates. It is impossible to cite here the worst\r\nexcesses; it is enough to note that a \"cultured\" congregation applauded\r\na preacher who dared to speak of \"the divine Adonis, Christ, enamoured\r\nof that singular Psyche, Mary!\" Bishops in their pastorals, monks\r\nlike Feijóo in his _Cartas eruditas_, and laymen like Mayáns in his\r\n_Orador Cristiano_ (1733), strove ineffectually to reform the abuse:\r\nwhere exhortation failed, satire succeeded. Isla had witnessed these\r\npulpit extravagances at first hand, and his six quarto volumes of\r\nsermons—none of them inspiring to read, however impressive when\r\ndelivered—show that he himself had begun by yielding to a mode from\r\nwhich his good sense soon freed him.\r\n\r\nHis _Historia del famoso Predicador Fray Gerundio de Campazas, alias\r\nZotes_ (1758), published by Isla under the name of his friend,\r\nFrancisco Lobón de Salazar, parish priest of Aguilar and Villagarcía\r\ndel Campo, is an attempt to do for pulpit profanity what _Don Quixote_\r\nhad done for chivalresque extravagances. It purports to be the story\r\nof a peasant-boy, Gerundio, with a natural faculty for clap-trap, which\r\nleads him to take orders, and gains for him no small consideration. A\r\npassage from the sermon which decided Gerundio's childish vocation may\r\nbe quoted as typical:—\"Fire, fire, fire! the house is a-flame! _Domus\r\nmea, domus orationis vocabitur_. Now, sacristan, peal those resounding\r\nbells: _in cymbalis bene sonantibus_. That's the style: as the\r\njudicious Picinelus observed, a death-knell and a fire-tocsin are just\r\nthe same. _Lazarus amicus noster dormit_. Water, sirs, water! the earth\r\nis consumed—_quis dabit capiti meo aquam_.... Stay! what do I behold?\r\nChristians, alas! the souls of the faithful are a-fire!—_fidelium\r\nanimæ_. Molten pitch feeds the hungry flames like tinder: _requiescat\r\nin pace, id est, in pice_, as Vetablus puts it. How God's fire devours!\r\n_ignis a Deo illatus_. Tidings of great joy! the Virgin of Mount Carmel\r\ndescends to save those who wore her holy scapular: _scapulis suis_.\r\nChrist says: 'Help in the King's name!' The Virgin pronounceth: 'Grace\r\nbe with me!' _Ave Maria._\" And so forth at much length.\r\n\r\nIsla fails in his attempt to solder fast impossibilities, to amalgamate\r\nrhetorical doctrine with farcical burlesque; nor has his book the\r\nsaving quality of style. Still, though it be too long drawn out, it\r\nabounds with an emphatic, violent humour which is almost irresistible\r\nat a first reading. The Second Part, published in 1770, is a work of\r\nsupererogation. The First caused a furious controversy in which the\r\nregulars combined to throw mud at the Jesuits with such effect that, in\r\n1760, the Holy Office intervened, confiscated the volume, and forbade\r\nall argument for or against it. Ridicule, however, did its work in\r\nsurreptitious copies; so that when the author was expelled from Spain\r\nwith the rest of his order in 1765, Fray Gerundio and his like were\r\nreformed characters. In 1787 Isla translated _Gil Blas_, under the\r\nimpression that he was \"restoring the book to its native land.\" The\r\nsuggestion that Le Sage merely plagiarised a Spanish original is due in\r\nthe first place to Voltaire, who made it, for spiteful reasons of his\r\nown, in the famous _Siècle de Louis XIV._ (1751). As some fifteen or\r\ntwenty episodes are unquestionably borrowed from Espinel and others, it\r\nwas not unnatural that Spaniards should (rather late in the day) take\r\nVoltaire at his word; none the less, the character of Gil Blas himself\r\nis as purely French as may be, and Le Sage vindicates his originality\r\nby his distinguished treatment of borrowed matter. Isla's version is\r\na sound, if unnecessary, piece of work, spoiled by the inclusion of a\r\nworthless sequel due to the Italian, Giulio Monti.\r\n\r\nThe action of French tradition is visible in NICOLÁS FERNÁNDEZ DE\r\nMORATÍN (1737-80), whose _Hormesinda_ (1770), a dramatic exercise in\r\nRacine's manner, too highly rated by literary friends, was condemned\r\nby the public. His prose dissertations consist of invectives against\r\nLope and Calderón, and of eulogies on Luzán's cold verse. These are\r\nall forgotten, and Moratín, who remained a good patriot, despite his\r\nefforts to Gallicise himself, survives at his best in his brilliant\r\npanegyric on bull-fighting—the _Fiesta de Toros en Madrid_—whose\r\nspirited _quintillas_, modelled after Lope's example, are in every\r\nSpaniard's memory.\r\n\r\nMoratín's friend, JOSÉ DE CADALSO Y VÁZQUEZ (1741-1782), a colonel\r\nin the Bourbon Regiment, after passing most of his youth in Paris,\r\ntravelled through England, Germany, and Italy, returning as free from\r\nnational prejudices as a young man can hope to be. A certain elevation\r\nof character and personal charm made him a force among his intimates,\r\nand even impressed strangers; as we may judge by the fact that, when he\r\nwas killed at the siege of Gibraltar, the English army wore mourning\r\nfor him. His more catholic taste avoided the exaggerations of Nasarre\r\nand Moratín; he found praise for the national theatre, and many of\r\nhis verses imply close study of Villegas and Quevedo. Even so, his\r\nattachment to the old school was purely theoretical. His knowledge of\r\nEnglish led him to translate in verse—as Luzán had already translated\r\nin prose—passages from _Paradise Lost_; his sepulchral _Noches\r\nLúgubres_, written upon the death of his mistress, the actress María\r\nIgnacia Ibáñez, are plainly inspired by Young's _Night Thoughts_; his\r\n_Cartas Marruecas_ derive from the _Lettres Persanes_; his tragedy,\r\n_Don Sancho García_, an attempt to put in practice the canons of the\r\nFrench drama, transplants to Spain the rhymed couplets of the Parisian\r\nstage. The best example of Cadalso's cultivated talent is his poem\r\nentitled _Eruditos á la Violeta_, wherein he satirises pretentious\r\nscholarship with a light, firm touch. In curious contrast with\r\nCadalso's _Don Sancho García_ is the _Raquel_ (1778) of his friend\r\nVICENTE ANTONIO GARCÍA DE LA HUERTA Y MUÑOZ (1734-87), whose troubles\r\nwould seem to have affected his brain. Though Huerta brands Corneille\r\nand Racine as a pair of lunatics, he is a strait observer of the sacred\r\n\"unities\": in all other respects—in theme, monarchical sentiment,\r\nsonority of versification—_Raquel_ is a return upon the ancient\r\nclassic models. Its disfavour among foreign critics is inexplicable,\r\nfor no contemporary drama equals it in national savour. Huerta's\r\ngood intention exceeds his performance in the _Theatro Hespañol_, a\r\ncollection (in seventeen volumes) of national plays, arranged without\r\nmuch taste or knowledge.\r\n\r\nThis involved him in a bitter controversy, which probably shortened\r\nhis life. Prominent among his enemies was the Basque, FÉLIX MARÍA DE\r\nSAMANIEGO (1745-1801), whose early education was entirely French,\r\nand who regarded Lope much as Voltaire regarded Shakespeare. Though\r\nHuerta's intemperance lost him his cause, Samaniego's real triumph was\r\nin another field than that of controversy. His _Fábulas_ (1781-94),\r\nmostly imitations or renderings of Phædrus, La Fontaine, and Gay,\r\nare almost the best in their kind—simple, clear, and forcible. A\r\nyear earlier than Samaniego, the Jesuit Lasala, of Bologna, had\r\ntranslated the fables of Lukmān al-Hakīm into Latin, and, in 1784,\r\nMiguel García Asensio published a Castilian version. It does not\r\nappear that Samaniego knew anything of Lasala, nor was he disturbed\r\nby García Asensio's translation. Before the latter was in print,\r\nhe was annoyed at finding himself rivalled by TOMÁS DE IRIARTE Y\r\nOROPESA (1750-91), who had begun his career as a prose translator of\r\nMolière and Voltaire, and had charmed—or at least had drawn effusive\r\ncompliments from—Metastasio with a frigid poem, _La Música_ (1780).\r\nIn the following year Iriarte published his _Fábulas literarias_,\r\nputting the versified apologue to doctrinal uses, censuring literary\r\nfaults, and expounding what he held to be true doctrine. He took\r\nmost pride in his plays, _El Señorito mimado_ and _La Señorita\r\nmal criada_; yet the Spoiled Young Gentleman and the Ill-bred\r\nYoung Lady are forgotten—somewhat unjustly—by all but students,\r\nwhile the wit and polish of the fables have earned their author an\r\nexcessive fame. Iriarte was, in the best sense, an \"elegant\" writer.\r\nUnluckily for himself and us, much of his short life was, after the\r\neighteenth-century fashion, wasted in polemics with able, learned\r\nruffians, of whom Juan Pablo Forner (1756-97) is the most extreme type.\r\nForner's versified attack on Iriarte, _El Asno erudito_, is one of the\r\nmost ferocious libels ever printed. Literary men the world over are\r\nfamous for their manners: Spain is in this respect no better than her\r\nneighbours, and the abusive personalities which form a great part of\r\nher literary history during the last century are now the driest, most\r\nvacant chaff imaginable.\r\n\r\nIn pleasing contrast with these irritable mediocrities is the figure of\r\nGASPAR MELCHOR DE JOVE-LLANOS (1744-1811), the most eminent Spaniard\r\nof his age. Educated for the Church, Jove-Llanos turned to law,\r\nwas appointed magistrate at Seville in his twenty-fourth year, was\r\ntransferred to Madrid in 1778, became a member of the Council of Orders\r\nin 1780, was exiled to Asturias on the fall of Cabarrús in 1790, and\r\nseven years later was appointed Minister of Justice. The incarnation\r\nof all that was best in the liberalism of his time, he was equally\r\nodious to reactionaries and revolutionists. A stern moralist, he\r\nstrove to end the intrigue between the Queen and the notorious Godoy,\r\nPrince of the Peace, and at the latter's instance was dismissed from\r\noffice in 1798. He passed the years 1801-8 a prisoner in the Balearic\r\nIslands, returning to find Spain under the heel of France. His prose\r\nwritings, political, economic, and didactic, do not concern us here,\r\nthough their worth is admitted by good judges. Jove-Llanos is most\r\ninteresting because of his own poetic achievement, and because of his\r\ninfluence on the group of Salamancan poets. His play, _El Delincuente\r\nHonrado_ (1774), is a doctrinaire exercise in the manner of Diderot's\r\n_Fils Naturel_; it shows considerable knowledge of dramatic effect,\r\nand its sentimental, sincere philanthropy persuaded audiences in and\r\nout of Spain to accept Jove-Llanos for a dramatist. At most he is a\r\nclever playwright. Yet, though not an artist in either prose or verse,\r\nthough far from irreproachable in diction, he occasionally utters a\r\npure poetic note, keen and vibrating in satire, noble and austere in\r\nthat _Epistle to the Duque de Veragua_, which, by common consent, best\r\nreflects the tranquil dignity of his temperament.\r\n\r\nJove-Llanos' official position, his high ideals, his knowledge,\r\ndiscernment, and wise counsel were placed at the service of JUAN\r\nMELÉNDEZ VALDÉS (1754-1817), the chief poet of the Salamancan school,\r\nwho came under his influence in or about 1777. Jove-Llanos succeeded by\r\nsheer force of character: Meléndez was a weather-cock at the mercy of\r\nevery breeze. A writer of erotic verses, he thought of taking orders;\r\na pastoral poet, he turned to philosophy by Jove-Llanos' advice;\r\nunfortunate in his marriage, discontented with his professorship at\r\nSalamanca, he dabbled in politics, becoming, through his friend's\r\npatronage, a government official: and when Jove-Llanos fell, Meléndez\r\nfell with him. It is hard to decide whether Meléndez was a rogue or\r\na weakling. Upon the French invasion, he began by writing verses\r\ncalling his people to arms, and ended by taking office under the\r\nforeign government. He fawned upon Joseph Bonaparte, whom he vowed\r\n\"to love each day,\" and he hailed the restoration of the Spanish with\r\npatriotic enthusiasm. Finally, the dishonoured man fled for very shame\r\nand safety. Loving iniquity and hating justice, he died in exile at\r\nMontpellier.\r\n\r\nHe typifies the fluctuations of his time. His natural bent was towards\r\npastoralism, as his early poems, modelled on Garcilaso and on Torre,\r\nremain to prove; he took to liberalism at Jove-Llanos' suggestion,\r\nas he would have taken to absolutism had that been the craze of the\r\nmoment; he read Locke, Young, Turgot, and Condorcet at the instance of\r\nhis friends. \"_Obra soy tuya_\" (\"I am thy handiwork\"), he writes to\r\nJove-Llanos. He was ever the handiwork of the last comer: a shadow of\r\ninsincerity, of pose, is over all his verse. Yet, like his countryman\r\nLucan, Meléndez demonstrates the truth that a worthless creature may\r\nbe, within limits, a genuine poet. He has neither morals nor ideas; he\r\nhas fancy, ductility, clearness, music, charm, and a picturesque vision\r\nof natural detail that have no counterpart in his period. Compared\r\nwith his brethren of the Salamancan school—with Diego Tadeo González\r\n(1733-94), with José Iglesias de la Casa (1753-91), even with Nicasio\r\nÁlvarez de Cienfuegos (1764-1809)—Meléndez appears a veritable giant.\r\nHe was not quite that any more than they were pigmies; but he had a\r\nspark of genius, while their faculty was no more than talent.[29]\r\n\r\nHis one distinct failure was when he ventured on the boards with his\r\n_Wedding Feast of Camacho_, founded on Cervantes' famous story, though\r\neven here the pastoral passages are pleasing, if inappropriate. It is\r\nto his credit that his theme is national, while his general dramatic\r\nsympathies were, like those of his associates, French. Luzán and his\r\nfollowers found it easier to condemn the ancient masterpieces than\r\nto write masterpieces of their own. Their function was negative,\r\ndestructive; yet when the prohibition of _autos_ was procured in 1765\r\nby José Clavijo y Fajardo (1730-1806)—whose adventure with Louise\r\nCaron, Beaumarchais' sister, gave Goethe a subject—they hoped to force\r\na hearing for themselves. They overlooked the fact that there already\r\nexisted a national dramatist named RAMÓN DE LA CRUZ Y CANO (1731-?\r\n95), who had the merit of inventing a new _genre_, which, being racy\r\nof the soil, was to the popular taste. Convention had settled it that\r\ntragedies should present the misfortunes of emperors and dukes; that\r\ncomedies should deal with the middle class, their sentimentalities\r\nand foibles. Cruz, a government clerk, with sufficient leisure to\r\ncompose three hundred odd plays, became in some sort the dramatist of\r\nthe needy, the disinherited, the have-nots of the street. He might\r\nvery well sympathise with them, for he was always pinched for money,\r\nand died so destitute that his widow had not wherewith to bury him.\r\nBeginning, like the rest of the world, with French imitations and\r\nrenderings, he turned to representing the life about him in short\r\nfarcical pieces called _sainetes_—a perfect development of the old\r\n_pasos_. In the prologue to the ten-volume edition of his _sainetes_\r\n(1786-91), Cruz proclaims his own merit in a just and striking\r\nphrase—\"I write, and truth dictates to me.\" His gaiety, his picaresque\r\nenjoyment, his exuberant humour, his jokes and puns and quips, lend\r\nan extraordinary vivacity to his presentation of the most trifling\r\nincidents. He might have been—as he began by being—a pompous prig and\r\nbore, preaching high doctrine, and uttering the platitudes, which alone\r\nwere thought worthy of the sock and buskin. He chose the better part in\r\nrendering what he knew and understood and saw, in amusing his public\r\nfor thirty years, and in bequeathing a thousand occasions of laughter\r\nto the world. He wrote with a reckless, contagious humour, with a comic\r\n_brio_ which anticipates Labiche; and, unambitious and light-hearted as\r\nCruz was, we may learn more of contemporary life from _El Prado por la\r\nNoche_ and _Las Tertulias de Madrid_ than from a mountain of serious\r\nrecords and chronicles.\r\n\r\nIn the following generation LEANDRO FERNÁNDEZ DE MORATÍN (1760-1828)\r\nwon deserved repute as a playwright. His father, the author of\r\n_Hormesinda_, made a jeweller's apprentice of the boy who, in 1779\r\nand 1782, won two _accesits_ from the Academy. He thus attracted the\r\nnotice of Jove-Llanos, who secured his appointment as Secretary to the\r\nParis Embassy in 1787. His stay in France, followed by later travels\r\nthrough England, the Low Countries, Germany, and Italy, completed\r\nhis education, and obtained for him the post of official translator.\r\nHis exercises in verse are more admirable than his prose version of\r\n_Hamlet_, which offended his academic theories in every scene. Molière,\r\nwho was his ideal, has no more faithful follower than the younger\r\nMoratín. His translations of _L'École des Maris_ and _Le Médecin\r\nmalgré lui_ belong to his later years; but his theatre, including\r\nthose most striking pieces _El Sí de las Niñas_ (The Maids' Consent)\r\nand _La Mojigata_ (The Hypocritical Woman), reflects the master's\r\nhumour and observation. The latter comedy (1804) brought him into\r\ntrouble with the Inquisition; the former (1806) established his fame\r\nby its character-drawing, its graceful ingenuity, and witty dialogue.\r\nHis fortunes, which seemed assured, were wrecked by the French war.\r\nMoratín was always timid, even in literary combats: he now proved\r\nhimself that very rare thing among Spaniards—a physical coward. He\r\nneither dared declare for his country nor against it, and went into\r\nhiding at Vitoria. He finally accepted the post of Royal Librarian to\r\nJoseph Bonaparte, and when the crash came he decamped to Peñiscola.\r\nThese events turned his brain. All efforts to help him (and they were\r\nmany) proved useless. He wandered as far as Italy to escape imaginary\r\nassassins, and finally settled in Bordeaux, where he believed himself\r\nsafe from the conspirators. _El Sí de las Niñas_ is an excellent piece\r\namong the best, and is sufficient to persuade the most difficult reader\r\nthat Leandro Moratín was one of nature's wasted forces. He must have\r\nwon distinction in any company: in this dreary period he achieves real\r\neminence.\r\n\r\nNo prose-writer of the time rises to Isla's level. His brother Jesuit,\r\nLorenzo Hervás y Panduro (1735-1809), is credited by Professor Max\r\nMüller with \"one of the most brilliant discoveries in the history of\r\nthe science of language,\" and may be held for the father of comparative\r\nphilology; but his specimens and notices of three hundred tongues, his\r\ngrammars of forty languages, his classic _Catálogo de las lenguas de\r\nlas naciones conocidas_ (1800-5) appeal more to the specialist than to\r\nthe lover of literature. Yet in his own department there is scarcely a\r\nmore splendid name.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[29] For two singularly acute critical studies by M. E. Mérimée on\r\nJove-Llanos and Meléndez Valdés, see the _Revue hispanique_ (Paris,\r\n1894). vol. i. pp. 34-68, and pp. 217-235.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER XII\r\n\r\n                        THE NINETEENTH CENTURY\r\n\r\n\r\nIntellectual interaction between Spain and France is an inevitable\r\noutcome of geographical position. To the one or to the other must\r\nbelong the headship of the Latin races; for Portugal is, so to say,\r\nbut a prolongation of Galicia, while the unity of Italy dates from\r\nyesterday. This hegemony was long contested. During a century and a\r\nhalf, fortune declared for Spain: the balance is now redressed in\r\nFrance's favour. The War of the Succession, the invasion of 1808, the\r\nexpedition of 1823, the contrivance of the Spanish marriages show that\r\nLouis XIV., Napoleon I., Charles X., and Louis-Philippe dared risk\r\ntheir kingdoms rather than loosen their grip on Spain. More recent\r\nexamples are not lacking. The primary occasion of the Franco-German\r\nWar in 1870-71 was the proposal to place a Hohenzollern on the Spanish\r\nthrone, and the Parisian outburst against \"Alfonso the Uhlan\" was\r\nan expression of resentment against a Spanish King who chafed under\r\nFrench tutelage. Since there is no ground for believing that France\r\nwill renounce a traditional diplomacy maintained, under all forms of\r\ngovernment, for over two centuries, it is not rash to assume that in\r\nthe future, as in the past, intellectual development will tend to\r\ncoincide with political influence. French literary fashions affect all\r\nEurope more or less: they affect Spain more.\r\n\r\nIt is a striking fact that the great national poet of the War of\r\nIndependence should be indisputably French in all but patriotic\r\nsentiment. MANUEL JOSÉ QUINTANA (1772-1857) was an offshoot of the\r\nSalamancan school, a friend of Jove-Llanos and of Meléndez Valdés, a\r\nfollower of Raynal and Turgot and Condorcet, a \"philosopher\" of the\r\neighteenth-century model. Too much stress has, perhaps, been laid on\r\nhis French constructions, his acceptance of neologisms: a more radical\r\nfault is his incapacity for ideas. Had he died at forty his fame would\r\nbe even greater than it is; for in his last years he did nothing but\r\nrepeat the echoes of his youth. At eighty he was still perorating on\r\nthe rights of man, as though the world were a huge Jacobin Convention,\r\nas though he had learned and forgotten nothing during half a century\r\nHe died, as he had lived, convinced that a few changes of political\r\nmachinery would ensure a perpetual Golden Age. It is not for his _Duque\r\nde Viseo_, a tragedy based on M. G. Lewis's _Castle Spectre_, nor by\r\nhis _Ode to Juan de Padilla_, that Quintana is remembered. The partisan\r\nof French ideas lives by his _Call to Arms against the French_, by his\r\npatriotic campaign against the invaders, by his prose biographies of\r\nthe Cid, the Great Captain, Pizarro, and other Spaniards of the ancient\r\ntime. We might suspect, if we did not know, Quintana's habit of writing\r\nhis first rough drafts in prose, and of translating these into verse.\r\nThough he proclaimed himself a pupil of Meléndez, nature and love\r\nare not his true themes, and his versification is curiously unequal.\r\nPatriotism, politics, philanthropy are his inspirations, and these\r\nfind utterance in the lofty rhetoric of such pieces as his _Ode to\r\nGuzmán the Good_ and the _Ode on the Invention of Printing_. Unequal,\r\nunrestrained, never exquisite, never completely admirable for more\r\nthan a few lines at a time, Quintana's passionate pride of patriotism,\r\nhis virile temperament, his individual gift of martial music have\r\nenabled him to express with unsurpassed fidelity one very conspicuous\r\naspect of his people's genius.\r\n\r\nAnother patriotic singer is the priest, JUAN NICASIO GALLEGO\r\n(1777-1853), who, like many political liberals, was so staunchly\r\nconservative in literature that he condemned _Notre Dame de Paris_ in\r\nthe very spirit of an alarmed Academician. Slight as is the bulk of his\r\nwritings, Gallego's high place is ensured by his combination of extreme\r\nfinish with extreme sincerity. His elegy _On the Death of the Duquesa\r\nde Frias_ is tremulous with the accent of profound emotion; but he is\r\neven better known by _El Dos de Mayo_, which celebrates the historic\r\nrising of the second of May, when the artillerymen, Jacinto Ruiz, Luis\r\nDaoiz, and Pedro Velarte, by their refusal to surrender their three\r\nguns and ten cartridges to the French army, gave the signal for the\r\ngeneral rising of the Spanish nation. His ode _Á la defensa de Buenos\r\nAires_, against the English, is no less distinguished for its heroic\r\nspirit. There is a touch of irony in the fact that Gallego should be\r\nbest represented by his denunciation of the French, whom he adored, and\r\nby his denunciation of the British, who were to assist in freeing his\r\ncountry.\r\n\r\nTime has misused the work of FRANCISCO MARTÍNEZ DE LA ROSA (1788-1862)\r\nwho at one time was held by Europe as the literary representative of\r\nSpain. No small part of his fame was due to his prominent position in\r\nSpanish politics; but the disdainful neglect which has overtaken him\r\nis altogether unmerited. Not being an original genius, his lyrics are\r\nbut variations of earlier melodies: thus the _Ausencia de la patria_\r\nis a metrical exercise in Jorge Manrique's manner; the song which\r\ncommemorates the defence of Zaragoza is inspired by Quintana; the\r\nelegy _On the Death of the Duquesa de Frias_, far short of Gallego's\r\nin pathos and dignity, is redolent of Meléndez. His novel, _Doña\r\nIsabel de Solís_, is an artless imitation of Sir Walter Scott; nor\r\nare his declamatory tragedies, _La Viuda de Padilla_ and _Moraima_,\r\nof perdurable value any more than his Moratinian plays, such as _Los\r\nCelos Infundados_. Martínez de la Rosa's exile passed in Paris led him\r\nto write the two pieces by which he is remembered: his _Conjuración de\r\nVenecia_ (1834), and his _Aben-Humeya_ (the latter first written in\r\nFrench, and first played at the Porte Saint-Martin in 1830) denote the\r\nearliest entry into Spain of French romanticism, and are therefore of\r\nreal historic importance. Fate was rarely more freakish than in placing\r\nthis modest, timorous man at the head of a new literary movement. Still\r\nstranger it is that his two late romantic experiments should be the\r\nbest of his manifold work.\r\n\r\nBut he was not fitted to maintain the leadership which circumstances\r\nhad allotted to him, and romanticism found a more popular exponent in\r\nÁngel de Saavedra, DUQUE DE RIVAS (1791-1865), the very type of the\r\nradical noble. His exile in France and in England converted him from\r\na follower of Meléndez and Quintana to a sectary of Chateaubriand and\r\nByron. His first essays in the new vein were an admirable lyric, _Al\r\nfaro de Malta_, and _El Moro expósito_, a narrative poem undertaken\r\nby the advice of John Hookham Frere. Brilliant passages of poetic\r\ndiction, the semi-epical presentation of picturesque national legends,\r\nare Rivas' contribution to the new school. He went still further in\r\nhis famous play, _Don Álvaro_ (1835), an event in the history of the\r\nmodern Spanish drama corresponding to the production of _Hernani_ at\r\nthe Théâtre Français. The characters of Álvaro, of Leonor, and of her\r\nbrother Alfonso Vargas are, if not inhuman, all but titanic, and the\r\nspeeches are of such magniloquence as man never spoke. But for the\r\nSpaniards of the third decade, Rivas was the standard-bearer of revolt,\r\nand _Don Álvaro_, by its contempt for the unities, by its alternation\r\nof prose with lyrism, by its amalgam of the grandiose, the comic, the\r\nsublime, and the horrible, enchanted a generation of Spanish playgoers\r\nsurfeited with the academic drama.\r\n\r\nTo English readers of Mr. Gladstone's essay, the Canon of Seville, JOSÉ\r\nMARÍA BLANCO (1775-1841), is familiar by the alias of Blanco White. It\r\nwere irrelevant to record here the lamentable story of Blanco's private\r\nlife, or to follow his religious transformations from Catholicism to\r\nUnitarianism. A sufficient idea of his poetic gifts is afforded by an\r\nEnglish quatorzain which has found favour with many critics:—\r\n\r\n  \"_Mysterious night! When our first parent knew\r\n    Thee, from report divine, and heard thy name,\r\n    Did he not tremble for this lovely frame,\r\n  This glorious canopy of light and blue?\r\n  Yet 'neath a curtain of translucent dew\r\n    Bathed in the rays of the great setting flame,\r\n    Hesperus, with the host of heaven, came,\r\n  And lo! Creation widened in man's view.\r\n    Who could have thought such darkness lay concealed\r\n      Within thy beams, O Sun? or who could find,\r\n    Whilst fly, and leaf, and insect stood revealed,\r\n      That to such countless orbs thou madest us blind?\r\n    Why do we then shun death with anxious strife?\r\n    If light can thus deceive, wherefore not life?_\"\r\n\r\nThis is as characteristic as his _Oda á Carlos III._ or the remorseful\r\nCastilian lines on _Resigned Desire_, penned within a year of his\r\ndeath. A very similar talent was that of Blanco's friend, ALBERTO LISTA\r\n(1775-1848), also a Canon of Seville Cathedral, a most accomplished\r\nsinger, whose golden purity of tone compensates for a deficient volume\r\nof voice and an affected method. But, save for such a fragment of\r\nimpassioned, plangent melody as the poem _Á la Muerte de Jesús_, Lista\r\nis less known as a poet than as a teacher of remarkable influence. His\r\n_Lecciones de Literatura Española_ did for Spain what Lamb's _Specimens\r\nof English Dramatic Poets_ did for England, and his personal authority\r\nover some of the best minds of his age was almost as complete in scope\r\nas it was gentle in exercise and excellent in effect.\r\n\r\nThe most famous of his pupils was JOSÉ DE ESPRONCEDA (1810-42), who\r\ncame under Lista at the Colegio de San Mateo, in Madrid, where the boy,\r\nwho was in perpetual scrapes through idleness and general bad conduct,\r\nattracted the rector's notice by his extraordinary poetic precocity.\r\nThrough good and evil report Lista held by Espronceda to the last,\r\nand was perhaps the one person who ever persuaded him from a rash\r\npurpose. At fourteen Espronceda joined a secret society called _Los\r\nNumantinos_, which was supposed to work for liberty, equality, and the\r\nrest. The young Numantine was deported to a monastery in Guadalajara,\r\nwhere, on the advice of Lista (who himself contributed some forty\r\noctaves), he began his epical essay, _El Pelayo_. Like most other boys\r\nwho have begun epics, Espronceda left his unfinished, and, though the\r\nstanzas that remain are of a fine but unequal quality, they in no way\r\nforeshadow the chief of the romantic school.\r\n\r\nReturning to Madrid, Espronceda was soon concerned in more\r\nconspiracies, and escaped to Gibraltar, whence he passed to Lisbon.\r\nA suggestion of the Byronic pose is found in the story (of his own\r\ntelling) that, before landing, he threw away his last two _pesetas_,\r\n\"not wishing to enter so great a town with so little money.\" In Lisbon\r\nhe met with that Teresa who figures so prominently in his life; but\r\nthe Government was once more on his track, and he fled to London,\r\nwhere Byron's poems came upon him with the force of a revelation. In\r\nEngland he found Teresa, now married, and eloped with her to Paris,\r\nwhere, on the three \"glorious days\" of July 1830, he fought behind\r\nthe barricades. The overthrow of Charles X. put such heart into the\r\nSpanish _emigrados_ that, under the leadership of the once famous\r\nChapalangarra—Joaquín de Pablo—they determined to raise all Spain\r\nagainst the monarchy. The attempt failed, Chapalangarra was killed in\r\nNavarre, and Espronceda did not return to Spain till the amnesty of\r\n1833. He obtained a commission in the royal bodyguard, and seemed on\r\nthe road to fortune, when he was cashiered because of certain verses\r\nread by him at a political banquet. He turned to journalism, incited\r\nthe people to insurrection by articles and speeches, held the streets\r\nagainst the regular army in 1835-36, shared in the liberal triumph\r\nof 1840, and, on the morrow of the successful revolution which he\r\nhad organised, pronounced in favour of a republic. He was appointed\r\nSecretary to the Embassy at the Hague in 1841, returning to Spain\r\nshortly afterwards on his election as deputy for Almería. He died\r\nafter four days of illness on May 23, 1842, in his thirty-third year,\r\nexhausted by his stormy life. A most formidable journalist, a demagogue\r\nof consummate address, a man-at-arms who had rather fight than not,\r\nEspronceda might have cut out for himself a new career in politics—or\r\nmight have died upon the scaffold or at the barricades. But, so far\r\nas concerns poetry, his work was done: an aged Espronceda is as\r\ninconceivable as an elderly Byron, a venerable Shelley.\r\n\r\nByron was the paramount influence of Espronceda's life and works. The\r\nConde de Toreno, a caustic politician and man of letters, who was once\r\nasked if he had read Espronceda, replied: \"Not much; but then I have\r\nread all Byron.\" The taunt earned Toreno—\"insolent fool with heart of\r\nslime\"—a terrific invective in the first canto of _El Diablo Mundo_:—\r\n\r\n  \"_Al necio audaz de corazón de cieno,\r\n  Á quien llaman el Conde de Toreno._\"\r\n\r\nThe gibe was ill-natured, but Espronceda's resentment goes to show\r\nthat he felt its plausibility. If Toreno meant that Espronceda,\r\nlike Heine, Musset, Leopardi, and Pushkin, took Byron for a model,\r\nhe spoke the humble truth. Like Byron, Espronceda became the centre\r\nof a legend, and—so to say—he made up for the part. He advertised\r\nhis criminal repute with manifest gusto, and gave the world his own\r\nportrait in the shape of pale, gloomy, splendid heroes. Don Félix de\r\nMontemar, in _El Estudiante de Salamanca_, is Don Juan Tenorio in a\r\nnew environment—\"fierce, insolent, irreligious, gallant, haughty,\r\nquarrelsome, insult in his glance, irony on his lips, fearing naught,\r\ntrusting solely to his sword and courage.\" Again, in the famous\r\ndeclamatory address _To Jarifa_, there is the same disillusioned view\r\nof life, the same lust for impossible pleasures, the same picturesque\r\nmingling of misanthropy and aspiration. Once more, the Fabio of the\r\nfragmentary _Diablo Mundo_ is replenished with the Byronic spirit\r\nof defiant pessimism, the Byronic intention of epical mockery. And\r\nso throughout all his pieces the protagonist is always, and in all\r\nessentials, José de Espronceda.\r\n\r\nWhether any writer—or, at all events, any but the very greatest—has\r\never succeeded completely in shedding his own personality is doubtful.\r\nEspronceda, at least, never attempted it, and consequently his dramatic\r\npieces—_Doña Blanca de Borbón_, for example—were foredoomed to fail.\r\nBut this very force of temperament, this very element of artistic\r\negotism, lends life and colour to his songs. The _Diablo Mundo_,\r\nthe _Estudiante de Salamanca_, ostensibly formed upon the models of\r\nGoethe, and Byron, and Tirso de Molina, are utterances of individual\r\nimpressions, detached lyrics held together by the merest thread.\r\nScarcely a typical Spaniard in life or in art, Espronceda is, beyond\r\nall question, the most distinguished Spanish lyrical poet of the\r\ncentury. His abandonment, his attitude of revolt, his love of love and\r\nlicence—one might even say his turn for debauchery and anarchy—are\r\nthe notes of an epoch rather than the characteristics of a country;\r\nand, in so much, he is cosmopolitan rather than national. But the\r\nmerciless observation of _El Verdugo_ (The Executioner), the idealised\r\nconception of Elvira in _El Estudiante de Salamanca_, are strictly\r\nrepresentative of Quevedo's and of Calderón's tradition; while his\r\nartificial but sympathetic rhetoric, his resonant music, his brilliant\r\nimagery, his uncalculating vehemence, bear upon them the stamp of all\r\nhis race's faults and virtues. In this sense he speaks for Spain, and\r\nSpain repays him by ranking him as the most inspired, if the most\r\nunequal, of her modern singers.\r\n\r\nHis contemporary, the Catalan, MANUEL DE CABANYES (1808-1833), died\r\ntoo young to reveal the full measure of his powers, and his _Preludios\r\nde mi lira_ (1833), though warmly praised by Torres Amat, Joaquín Roca\r\ny Cornet, and other critics of insight, can scarcely be said to have\r\nwon appreciation. Cabanyes is essentially a poet's poet, inspired\r\nmainly by Luis de León. His felicities are those of the accomplished\r\nstudent, the expert in technicalities, the almost impeccable artist\r\nwhose hendecasyllabics, _Á Cintio_, rival those of Leopardi in their\r\nperfect form and intense pessimism; but as his life was too brief, so\r\nhis production is too frugal and too exquisite for the general, and he\r\nis rated by his promise rather than by his actual achievement. Milá y\r\nFontanals and Sr. Menéndez y Pelayo have striven to spread Cabanyes'\r\ngood report, and they have so far succeeded that his genius is now\r\nadmitted on all hands; but his chill perfection makes no appeal to the\r\nmass of his countrymen.\r\n\r\nEspronceda's direct successor was JOSÉ ZORRILLA (1817-1893), whose\r\nlife's story may be read in his own _Recuerdos del tiempo viejo_\r\n(Old-time Memories). It was his misfortune to be concerned in politics,\r\nfor which he was unfitted, and to be pinched by continuous poverty,\r\nwhich drove him in 1855 to seek his fortune in Mexico, whence he\r\nreturned empty-handed in 1866. His closing years were somewhat happier,\r\ninasmuch as a pension of 30,000 _reales_, obtained at last by strenuous\r\nparliamentary effort, freed him from the pressure of actual want. It\r\nmay be that it came too late, and that Zorrilla's work suffers from\r\nhis straitened circumstances; but this is difficult to believe. He\r\nmight have produced less, might have escaped the hopeless hack-work\r\nto which he was compelled; but a finished artist he could never have\r\nbecome, for, by instinct as by preference, he was an improvisatore. The\r\ntale that (like Arthur Pendennis) he wrote verses to fit engravings\r\nis possibly an invention; but the inventor at least knew his man, for\r\nnothing is more intrinsically probable.\r\n\r\nHis carelessness, his haste, his defective execution are superficial\r\nfaults which must always injure Zorrilla in the esteem of foreign\r\ncritics; yet it is certain that the charm which he has exercised over\r\nthree generations of Spaniards, and which seems likely to endure,\r\nimplies the possession of considerable powers. And Zorrilla had three\r\nessential qualities in no common degree: national spirit, dramatic\r\ninsight, and lyrical spontaneity. He is an inferior Sir Walter, with\r\nan added knowledge of the theatre, to which Scott made no pretence.\r\nHis _Leyenda de Alhamar_, his _Granada_, his _Leyenda del Cid_ were\r\npopular for the same reason that _Marmion_ and the _Lady of the Lake_\r\nwere popular: for their revival of national legends in a form both\r\nsimple and picturesque. The fate that overcame Sir Walter's poems seems\r\nto threaten Zorrilla's. Both are read for the sake of the subject,\r\nfor the brilliant colouring of episodes, more than for the beauty of\r\ntreatment, construction, and form; yet, as Sir Walter survives in\r\nhis novels, Zorrilla will endure in such of his plays as _Don Juan\r\nTenorio_, in _El Zapatero y el Rey_, and in _Traidor, inconfeso,\r\ny mártir_. His selection of native themes, his vigorous appeal to\r\nthose primitive sentiments which are at least as strong in Spain as\r\nelsewhere—courage, patriotism, religion—have ensured him a vogue so\r\nwide and lasting that it almost approaches immortality. In the study\r\nZorrilla's slapdash methods are often wearisome; on the stage his\r\nimpetuousness, his geniality, his broad effects, and his natural lyrism\r\nmake him a veritable force. Two of Zorrilla's rivals among contemporary\r\ndramatists may be mentioned: ANTONIO GARCÍA GUTIÉRREZ (1813-1884), the\r\nauthor of _El Trovador_, and JUAN EUGENIO HARTZENBUSCH (1806-1880),\r\nwhose _Amantes de Teruel_ broke the hearts of sentimental ladies in the\r\nforties. Both the _Trovador_ and the _Amantes_ are still reproduced,\r\nstill read, and still praised by critics who enjoy the pleasures of\r\nmemory and association; but a detached foreigner, though he take his\r\nlife in his hand when he ventures on the confession, is inclined to\r\nassociate García Gutiérrez and Hartzenbusch with Sheridan Knowles and\r\nLytton.\r\n\r\nA much superior talent is that of the ex-soldier, MANUEL BRETÓN DE LOS\r\nHERREROS (1796-1873), whose humour and fancy are his own, while his\r\nsystem is that of the younger Moratín. His _Escuela del Matrimonio_\r\nis the most ambitious, as it is the best, of those innumerable pieces\r\nin which he aims at presenting a picture of average society, relieved\r\nby alternate touches of ironic and didactic purpose. Bretón de los\r\nHerreros wrote far too much, and weakens his effects by the obtrusion\r\nof a flagrant moral; but even if we convict him as a caricaturist\r\nof obvious Philistinism, there is abundant recompense in the jovial\r\nwit and graceful versification of his quips. To him succeeds Tomás\r\nRodríguez Rubí (1817-1890), who aimed at amusing a facile public\r\nin such a trifle as _El Tejado de Vidrio_ (The Glass Roof), or at\r\nsatirising political and social intriguers in _La Rueda de Fortuna_\r\n(Fortune's Wheel).\r\n\r\nA Cuban like GERTRUDIS GÓMEZ DE AVELLANEDA (1816-1873), who spent most\r\nof her life in Spain, may for our purposes be accounted a Spanish\r\nwriter. The proverbial gallantry of the nation and the sex of the\r\nwriter account for her vogue and her repute. If such a novel as _Sab_,\r\nwith its protest against slavery and its idealised presentation of\r\nsubject races, be held for literature, then we must so enlarge the\r\nscope of the word as to include _Uncle Tom's Cabin_. Another novel,\r\n_Espatolino_, reproduces George Sand's philippics against the injustice\r\nof social arrangements, and re-echoes her lyrical advocacy of freedom\r\nin the matter of marriage. The Sra. Avellaneda is too passionate to\r\nbe dexterous, and too preoccupied to be impressive; hence her novels\r\nhave fallen out of sight. That she had real gifts of fancy and melody\r\nis shown by her early volume of poems (1841), and by her two plays,\r\n_Alfonso Munio_ and _Baltasar_; yet, on the boards as in her stories,\r\nshe is inopportune, or, in plainer words, is a gifted imitator,\r\nfollowing the changes of popular taste with some hesitation, though\r\nwith a gracefulness not devoid of charm. With her may be mentioned\r\nCarolina Coronado (b. 1823), a refined poetess with mystic tendencies,\r\nwhose vogue has so diminished that to the most of Spaniards she is\r\nscarcely more than an agreeable reminiscence.\r\n\r\nIt is possible that the adroit politician, ADELARDO LÓPEZ DE AYALA\r\n(1828-1879), who passed from one party to another, and served a monarch\r\nor a republic with equal suppleness, might have won enduring fame as\r\na dramatist and poet had he been less concerned with doctrines and\r\ntheses. He was so intent on persuasion, so mindful of the arts of\r\nhis old trade, so anxious to catch a vote, that he rarely troubled\r\nto draw character, contenting himself with skilful construction of\r\nplot and arrangement of incident. His _Tanto por Ciento_ and his\r\n_Consuelo_ are astute harangues in favour of high public and private\r\nmorals, composed with extraordinary care and laudable purpose. If mere\r\ncleverness, a scrupulous eye to detail, a fine ear for sonorous verse\r\ncould make a man master of the scene, López de Ayala might stand beside\r\nthe greatest. His personages, however, are rather general types than\r\nindividual characters, and the persistent sarcasm with which he ekes\r\nout a moral degenerates into ponderous banter. None the less he was a\r\nforce during many years, and, though his reputation be now somewhat\r\ntarnished, he still counts admirers among the middle-aged.\r\n\r\nA very conspicuous figure on the Spanish scene during the middle third\r\nof the century was MANUEL TAMAYO Y BAUS (1829-1898), who, beginning\r\nwith an imitation of Schiller in _Juana de Arco_ (1847), passed under\r\nthe influence of Alfieri in _Virginia_ (1853), venturing upon the\r\nnational classic drama in _La Locura de Amor_ (1855), the most notable\r\nachievement of his early period. The most ambitious, and unquestionably\r\nthe best, of his plays is _Un drama nuevo_ (1867), with which his\r\ncareer practically closed. He effaced himself, was content to live\r\non his reputation and to yield his place as a popular favourite to\r\nso poor a playwright as José Echegaray. Compared with his successor,\r\nTamayo shines as a veritable genius. Sprung from a family of actors,\r\nhe gauged the possibilities of the theatre with greater exactness than\r\nany rival, and by his tact he became an expert in staging a situation.\r\nBut it was not merely to inspired mechanical dexterity that he owed\r\nthe high position which was allowed him by so shrewd a judge as Manuel\r\nde la Revilla: to his unequalled knowledge of the scene he joined the\r\nforces of passion and sympathy, the power of dramatic creation, and a\r\nmetrical ingenuity which enchanted and bewildered those who heard and\r\nthose who read him.\r\n\r\nThere is a feminine, if not a falsetto timbre in the voice of JOSÉ\r\nSELGAS Y CARRASCO (1824-1882), a writer on the staff of the fighting\r\njournal, _El Padre Cobos_, and a government clerk till Martínez\r\nCampos transfigured him into a Cabinet Minister. Selgas' verse in the\r\n_Primavera_ is so charged with the conventional sentiment and with\r\nthe amiable pessimism dear to ordinary readers, that his popularity\r\nwas inevitable. Yet even Spanish indulgence has stopped short of\r\nproclaiming him a great poet, and now that his day has gone by, he is\r\nalmost as unjustly decried as he was formerly overpraised. Though not a\r\ngreat original genius, he was an accomplished versifier whose innocent\r\nprettiness was never banal, whose simplicity was unaffected, whose\r\nfaint music and caressing melancholy are not lacking in individuality\r\nand fascination.\r\n\r\nA more powerful poetic impulse moved the Sevillan, GUSTAVO ADOLFO\r\nBÉCQUER (1836-1870). An orphan in his tenth year, Bécquer was educated\r\nby his godmother, a well-meaning woman of some position, who would have\r\nmade him her heir had he consented to follow any regular profession\r\nor to enter a merchant's office. At eighteen he arrived, a penniless\r\nvagabond, in Madrid, where he underwent such extremes of hardship as\r\nhelped to shorten his days. A small official post, which saved him from\r\nactual starvation, was at last obtained for him, but his indiscipline\r\nsoon caused him to be set adrift. He maintained himself by translating\r\nforeign novels, by journalistic hack-work in the columns of _El\r\nContemporaneo_ and _El Museo Universal_, till death delivered him.\r\n\r\nThe three volumes by which he is represented are made up of prose\r\nlegends, and of poems modestly entitled _Rimas_. Though Hoffmann is\r\nBécquer's intellectual ancestor in prose, the Spaniard speaks with\r\na personal accent in such examples of morbid fantasy as _Los Ojos\r\nVerdes_, wherein Fernando loses life for the sake of the green-eyed\r\nmermaiden: as the tale of Manrique's madness in _El Rayo de Luna_\r\n(The Moonbeam), as the rendering of Daniel's sacrilege in _La Rosa de\r\nPasión_. And as Hoffmann influences Bécquer's dreamy prose, so Heine\r\ninfluences his _Rimas_. It is argued that, since Bécquer knew no\r\nGerman, he cannot have read Heine—an unconvincing plea, if we remember\r\nthat Byron's example was followed in every country by poets ignorant of\r\nEnglish. Howbeit, it is certain that Heine has had no more brilliant\r\nfollower than Bécquer, who, however, substitutes a note of fairy\r\nmystery for Heine's incomparable irony. His circumstances, and the\r\nfact that he did not live to revise his work, account for occasional\r\ninequalities of execution which mar his magical music. To do him\r\njustice, we must read him in a few choice pieces where his apparently\r\nsimple rhythms and suave assonantic cadences express his half-delirious\r\nvisions in terms of unsurpassable artistry. At first sight one is\r\ndeceived into thinking that the simplicity is a spontaneous result,\r\nand there has arisen a host of imitators who have only contrived to\r\ncaricature Bécquer's defects. His merits are as purely personal as\r\nBlake's, and the imitation of either poet results almost inevitably in\r\nmere flatness.\r\n\r\n                   *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nDuring the nineteenth century Spain has produced no more brilliant\r\nmaster of prose than MARIANO JOSÉ DE LARRA (1809-1837), son of a\r\nmedical officer in the French army. It is a curious fact that, owing\r\nto his early education in France, Larra—one of the most idiomatic\r\nwriters—should have been almost ignorant of Spanish till his tenth\r\nyear. Destined for the law, he was sent to Valladolid, where he got\r\nentangled in some love affair which led him to renounce his career. He\r\ntook to literature, attempting the drama in his _Macías_, the novel in\r\n_El Doncel de Don Enrique el Doliente_: in neither was he successful.\r\nBut if he could not draw character nor narrate incident, he could\r\nobserve and satirise with amazing force and malice. Under the name\r\nof Fígaro[30] and of Juan Pérez de Munguia he won for himself such\r\nprominence in journalism as no Spaniard has ever equalled. Spanish\r\npolitics, the weaknesses of the national character, are exposed in a\r\nspirit of ferocious bitterness peculiar to the writer. His is, indeed,\r\na depressing performance, overcharged with misanthropy; yet for\r\nunflinching courage, insight, and sombre humour, Larra has no equal\r\nin modern Spanish literature, and scarcely any superior in the past.\r\nIn his twenty-eighth year he blew out his brains in consequence of an\r\namour in which he was concerned, leaving a vacancy which has never been\r\nfilled by any successor. It is gloomy work to learn that all men are\r\nscoundrels, and that all evils are irremediable: these are the hopeless\r\ndoctrines which have brought Spain to her present pass. Yet it is\r\nimpossible to read Larra's pessimistic page without admiration for his\r\nlucidity and power.\r\n\r\nAn essayist of more patriotic tone is SERAFÍN ESTÉBANEZ CALDERÓN\r\n(1799-1867), whose biography has been elaborately written by his\r\nnephew, Antonio Cánovas del Castillo, the late Prime Minister of\r\nSpain. Estébanez' verses are well-nigh as forgotten as his _Conquista\r\ny Pérdida de Portugal_, and his _Escenas Andaluzas_ (1847) have never\r\nbeen popular, partly through fault of the author, who enamels his work\r\nwith local or obsolete words in the style of Wardour Street, and who\r\nassumes a posture of superiority which irritates more than it amuses. A\r\nrecord of Andalucían manners and of fading customs, the _Escenas_ has\r\nspecial value as embodying the impression of an observer who valued\r\npicturesqueness—valued it so highly, in fact, that one is haunted\r\n(perhaps unjustly) by the suspicion that he heightened his tones for\r\nthe sake of effect. Another series of \"documents\" is afforded by RAMÓN\r\nDE MESONERO ROMANOS (1803-82), who is often classed as a follower\r\nof Larra, whereas the first of his _Escenas Matritenses_ appeared\r\nbefore Larra's first essays. He has no trace of Larra's energetic\r\ncondensation, tending, as he does, to a not ungraceful diffuseness;\r\nbut he has bequeathed us a living picture of the native Madrid before\r\nit sank to being a poor, pale copy of Paris, and has enabled us to\r\nreconstruct the social life of sixty years since. Mesonero, who has\r\nnone of Estébanez' airs and graces, though he is no less observant, and\r\nis probably more accurate, writes as a well-bred man speaks—simply,\r\nnaturally, directly; and those qualities are seen to most advantage in\r\nhis _Memorias de un Setentón_, which are as interesting as the best of\r\nreminiscences can be.\r\n\r\nThese records of customs and manners influenced a writer of German\r\norigin on her father's side, Cecilia Böhl de Faber, who was thrice\r\nmarried, and whom it is convenient to call by her pseudonym, FERNÁN\r\nCABALLERO (1796-1877), a village in Don Quixote's country. Her first\r\nnovel, _La Gaviota_ (1848), has probably been more read by foreigners\r\nthan any Spanish book of the century, and, with all its sensibility\r\nand moralisings, we can scarcely grudge its vogue; for it is true to\r\ncommon life as common life existed in an Andalucían village, and its\r\nstyle is natural, if not distinguished. Even in _La Gaviota_ there is\r\nan air of unreality when the scene is shifted from the country to the\r\ndrawing-room, and the suspicion that Fernán Caballero could invent\r\nwithout observing deepens in presence of such a wooden lay-figure as\r\nSir George Percy in _Clemencia_. Her didactic bent increased with\r\ntime, so that much of her later work is bedevilled with sermons and\r\ngospellings; yet so long as she deals with the rustic episodes which\r\nwere her earliest memories, so long as she is content to report and to\r\ndescribe, she produces a delightful series of pictures, touched in with\r\nan almost irreproachable refinement. She is not far enough from us to\r\nbe a classic; but she is sufficiently removed to be old-fashioned, and\r\nshe suffers accordingly. Still it is safe to prophesy that _La Gaviota_\r\nwill survive most younger rivals.\r\n\r\nIn all likelihood PEDRO ANTONIO DE ALARCÓN (1833-1891), who, like most\r\nliterary Spaniards, injured his work by meddling in politics, will\r\nlive by his shorter, more unambitious stories. His _Escándalo_ (1875),\r\nafter creating a prodigious sensation as a defence of the Jesuits from\r\nan old revolutionist, is already laid aside, and _La Pródiga_ is in\r\nno better case. The true Alarcón is revealed in _El Sombrero de tres\r\nPicos_, a picture of rustic manners, rendered with infinite enjoyment\r\nand merry humour; in the rapid, various sketches entitled _Historietas\r\nNacionales_; and in that gallant, picturesque account of the Morocco\r\ncampaign called the _Diario de un Testigo de la Guerra en África_—as\r\nvivid a piece of patriotic chronicling as these latest years have shown.\r\n\r\nOf graver prose modern Spain has little to boast. Yet the Marqués de\r\nValdegamas, JUAN DONOSO CORTÉS (1809-1853) has written an _Ensayo\r\nsobre el Catolicismo, el Liberalismo y el Socialismo_, which has been\r\nread and applauded throughout Europe. Donoso, the most intolerant of\r\nSpaniards, overwhelms his readers with dogmatic statement in place\r\nof reasoned exposition; but he writes with astonishing eloquence,\r\nand with a superb conviction of his personal infallibility that has\r\nscarcely any match in literature. At the opposite pole is the Vich\r\npriest, JAIME BALMES Y USPIA (1810-48), whose _Cartas á un Escéptico_\r\nand _Criterio_ are overshadowed by his _Protestantismo comparado en el\r\nCatolicismo_, a performance of striking ingenuity, among the finest\r\nin the list of modern controversy. Donoso denounced man's reason as\r\na gin of the devil, as a faculty whose natural tendency is towards\r\nerror. Balmes appeals to reason at every step of the road. With him,\r\nindeed, it is unsafe to allow that two and two are four until it is\r\nascertained what he means to do with that proposition; for his subtlety\r\nis almost uncanny, and his dexterity in using an opponent's admission\r\nis surprising. If anything, Balmes is even too clever, for the most\r\nsimple-minded reader is driven to ask how it is possible that any\r\nrational being can hold the opposite view. Still, from the Catholic\r\nstandpoint, Balmes is unanswerable, and—in Spain at least—he has\r\nnever been answered, while his vogue abroad has been very great.\r\nSetting aside its doctrinal bearing, his treatise is a most striking\r\nexample of destructive criticism and of marshalled argument.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[30] M. Morel-Fatio points out that Fígaro, which seems so Castilian by\r\nassociation, is not a Castilian name. See his _Études sur l'Espagne_\r\n(Paris, 1895), vol. i. p. 76. If it be not Catalan, if Beaumarchais\r\ninvented it, it is among the most successful of his coinage.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                             CHAPTER XIII\r\n\r\n                        CONTEMPORARY LITERATURE\r\n\r\n\r\nTo write an account of contemporary literature is an undertaking not\r\nless tempting than to write the history of contemporary politics.\r\nIts productions are likely to be familiar to us; its authors have\r\nprobably expressed ideas with which we are more or less in sympathy;\r\nand in dealing with these we are free from the burdens of authority\r\nand tradition. On the other hand, criticism of contemporaries is so\r\nprone to be coloured by the prejudice of sects and cliques, that the\r\nliberal historian of the past is in danger of exhibiting himself as a\r\nblind observer of the present, or as a ludicrous prophet of the future.\r\nA book on current literature is often, like Hansard, a melancholy\r\nregister of mistaken forecasts. Probably no critic of 1820 would have\r\nventured to place Keats among the greatest poets of the world. But\r\nthe risk of failing to recognise a Keats is, in the nature of things,\r\nvery slight; and for our present purpose we are only concerned with\r\nthose who, by general admission, are among the living influences of the\r\nmoment, the chiefs of a generation which is now almost middle-aged.\r\n\r\nNo Spaniard would contest the title of the Asturian, RAMÓN DE CAMPOAMOR\r\nY CAMPOOSORIO (b. 1817), to be considered as the actual _doyen_ of\r\nSpanish literature. He purposed entering the Society of Jesus in his\r\nyouth, then turned to medicine as his true vocation, and finally gave\r\nhimself up to poetry and politics. A fierce conservative, Campoamor\r\nhas served as Governor of Alicante and Valencia, and has combated\r\ndemocracy by speech and pen; but he has never been taken seriously as\r\na politician, and his few philosophic essays have caused his orthodoxy\r\nto be questioned by writers with an imperfect sense of humour. His\r\ncontroversy with Valera on metaphysics and poetry is a manifest joke\r\nto which both writers have lent themselves with an affectation of\r\nprofound solemnity; and it may well be doubted if Campoamor's professed\r\nconvictions are more than occasions for humoristic ingenuity.\r\n\r\nHe has attempted the drama without success in such pieces as _El\r\nPalacio de la Verdad_ and in _El Honor_. So also in the eight cantos\r\nof a grandiose poem entitled _El Drama Universal_ (1873) he has failed\r\nto impress with his version of the posthumous loves of Honorio and\r\nSoledad, though in the matter of technical execution nothing finer\r\nhas been accomplished in our day. His chief distinction, according to\r\nPeninsular critics, is that he has invented a new poetic _genre_ under\r\nthe names of _doloras_, _humoradas_ or _pequeños poemas_ (short poems).\r\nIt is not, however, an easy matter to distinguish any one of these from\r\nits brethren, and Campoamor's own explanation lacks clearness when\r\nhe lays it down that a _dolora_ is a dramatised _humorada_, and that\r\na _pequeño poema_ is an amplified _dolora_. This is to define light\r\nin terms of darkness. An acute critic, M. Peseux-Richard, has noted\r\nthat this definition is not only obscure, but that it is an evident\r\nafterthought.[31] The _dolora_ is the first in order of invention, and\r\nit is also the performance upon which, to judge by his _Poética_,\r\nCampoamor sets most value. What, then, is a _dolora_? It is, in\r\nfact, a \"transcendental\" fable in which men and women, their words\r\nand acts, are made to typify eternal \"verities\": a poem which aims\r\nat brevity, delicacy, pathos, and philosophy in an ironical setting.\r\nThe \"transcendental\" truth to be conveyed is the supreme point:\r\nexquisiteness of form is unimportant.\r\n\r\nM. Peseux-Richard dryly remarks that _humoradas_ are as old as anything\r\nin literature, and that Campoamor's exploit consists in inventing\r\nthe name, not the thing. This is true; and it is none the less true\r\nthat the writing of _doloras_ (and the rest), after the recipe of the\r\nmaster, has become a plague of recent Spanish literature. Fortunately\r\nCampoamor is better than his theories, which, if he were consistent,\r\nwould lead him straight to _conceptismo_. Doubtless, at whiles, he\r\ncondescends upon the banal, mistakes sentimentalism for sentiment,\r\nsubstitutes a commonplace for an aphorism, a paradox for an epigram;\r\ndoubtless, also, he is wanting in the right national note of exaltation\r\nand rhetorical splendour. But for all his profession of indifference to\r\nform, he is—at his best—a most accomplished craftsman, an admirable\r\nartist in miniature, an expert in the art of concise expression,\r\nand, in so much, a healthy influence—though not without a concealed\r\ngerm of evil. For if in his own hands the ingenious antithesis often\r\nreaches the utmost point of condensation, in the hands of imitators it\r\nis degraded to an obscure conceit, a rhymed conundrum. His vogue has\r\nalways been considerable, and he is one of the few Spanish poets whose\r\nreputation extends beyond the Pyrenees; still, he is not in any sense\r\na national poet, a characteristic product of the soil, and with all\r\nhis distinguished scepticism, his picturesque pessimistic pose, and his\r\nsound workmanship, he is more likely to be remembered for a score of\r\nbrilliant apophthegms than for any essentially poetic quality.\r\n\r\nIt was as a poet that JUAN VALERA Y ALCALÁ GALIANO (b. 1827) made his\r\nfirst appearance in literature in 1856. Few in Europe have seen more\r\naspects of life, or have snatched more profit from their opportunities.\r\nBorn at Córdoba, educated at Málaga and Granada, Valera has so enjoyed\r\nlife from the outset that his youth is now the subject of a legend.\r\nPassing from law to diplomacy, he learned the world in the legations\r\nat Naples, Lisbon, Rio Janeiro, Dresden, St. Petersburg; he helped\r\nto found _El Contemporaneo_, once a journal of great influence; he\r\nentered the Cortes, and became minister at Frankfort, Washington,\r\nBrussels, and Vienna. His native subtlety, his cosmopolitan tact, have\r\nserved him no less in literature than in affairs. To literature he has\r\ngiven the best that is in him. He has protested, with the ironical\r\nhumility in which he excels, against the public neglect of his poems;\r\nand when one reflects upon what has found favour in this kind, the\r\nprotest is half justified. Valera's verses, falling short as they do of\r\ninspired perfection, are wrought with curious delicacy of technique.\r\nBut his very cultivation is against him: such poems as _Sueños_ or\r\n_Último Adiós_ or _El Fuego divino_, admirable as they are, recall the\r\nwork of predecessors. Memories of Luis de León, traces of Dante and\r\nLeopardi, are encountered on his best page; and yet he brings with\r\nhim into modern verse qualities which, in the actual stage of Spanish\r\nliterature, are of singular worth—repose and refinement and dignity\r\nand metrical mastery.\r\n\r\nAs a critic his diplomatic training has been a hindrance to him.\r\nHe rarely writes without establishing some ingenious and suggestive\r\nparallel or pronouncing some luminous judgment; but he is, so to say,\r\nin fear of his own intelligence, and his instinctive courtesy, his\r\ndesire to please, often stay him from arriving at a clear conclusion.\r\nHis manifold interests, the incomparable beauty of his style, his wide\r\nreading, his cold lucidity, are an almost ideal equipment for critical\r\nwork. Expert in ingratiation as he is, his suave complaisance becomes\r\na formidable weapon in such a performance as the _Cartas Americanas_,\r\nwhere excessive urbanity has all the effect of commination: you set the\r\nbook down with the impression that the writers of the South American\r\ncontinent have been complimented out of existence by a stately courtier.\r\n\r\nBut whatever reserves may be made in praising the poet and the critic,\r\nValera's triumph as a novelist is incontestable. Mr. Gosse has so\r\nintroduced him to English readers as to make further criticism almost\r\nsuperfluous. Valera, for all his polite scepticism, is a Spaniard of\r\nthe best: a mystic by intuition and inheritance, a doubter by force of\r\ncircumstances and education. He himself has told us in the _Comendador\r\nMendoza_ how _Pepita Jiménez_ came into life as the result of much\r\nmystic reading, which held him fascinated but not captive; and were we\r\nto accept his humorous confession literally, we should take it that he\r\nbecame a novelist by accident. It is, however, true that when he wrote\r\n_Pepita Jiménez_ he still had much to learn in method. Writers with not\r\na tithe of his natural gift would have avoided his obvious faults—his\r\ndigressions, his episodes which check the current of his story. But\r\n_Pepita Jiménez_, whatever its defects, is of capital importance in\r\nliterary history, for from its publication dates the renaissance of\r\nthe Spanish novel. Here at last was a book owing nothing to France,\r\ntaking its root in native inspiration, arabesquing the motives of Luis\r\nde Granada, León, Santa Teresa, displaying once more what Coventry\r\nPatmore has well described as \"that complete synthesis of gravity of\r\nmatter and gaiety of manner which is the glittering crown of art, and\r\nwhich, out of Spanish literature, is to be found only in Shakespeare,\r\nand even in him in a far less obvious degree.\"\r\n\r\nAnd Valera has continued to progress in art. In construction, in depth,\r\nin psychological insight, _Doña Luz_ exceeds its predecessor, as the\r\n_Comendador Mendoza_ outshines both in vigour of expression, in tragic\r\nconception, in pathetic sincerity. _Las Ilusiones del Doctor Faustino_\r\nhas found less favour with critics and with general readers, perhaps\r\nbecause its humour is too refined, its observation too merciless, its\r\nstyle too subtle. Nor is Valera less successful in the short story,\r\nand in the dialogue, in which sort _Asclepigenia_ may be held for an\r\nabsolute masterpiece in little. His work lies before us, complete for\r\nall purposes; for though he still publishes for our delight, advancing\r\nage compels him to dictate instead of writing—a harassing condition\r\nfor an artist whose talent is free from any touch of declamation. It\r\nis hard for us who have undergone the spell of Prospero, who have\r\nbeen fascinated by his truth and grace and sympathy, to judge him\r\nwith the impartiality of posterity. But we may safely anticipate its\r\ngeneral verdict. It may be that some of his improvisations will lack\r\ndurability; but these are few. Valera, like the rest of the world, is\r\nentitled to be judged at his best, and his best will be read as long as\r\nSpanish literature endures; for he is not simply a dexterous craftsman\r\nusing one of the noblest of languages with an exquisite delicacy\r\nand illimitable variety of means, nor a clever novelist exercising\r\na superficial talent, nor even (though he is that in a very special\r\nsense) the leader of a national revival. He is something far rarer\r\nand more potent than an accomplished man of letters: a great creative\r\nartist, and the embodiment of a people's genius.\r\n\r\nA less cosmopolitan, but scarcely less original talent is that of\r\nJOSÉ MARÍA DE PEREDA (b. 1834), who comes, like so many distinguished\r\nSpaniards, from \"the mountain.\" Born at Polanco, trained as a civil\r\nengineer in his province of Santander, Pereda was—and, perhaps, still\r\nis, theoretically—a stout Carlist, an intransigent ultramontane whose\r\nsocial position has enabled him to despise the politics of expediency.\r\nHis earliest essays in a local newspaper, _La Abeja Montañesa_,\r\nattracted no attention; nor was he much more fortunate with his\r\namazingly brilliant _Escenas Montañesas_ (1864). Fernán Caballero,\r\nand a gentle sentimentalist now wholly forgotten, Antonio Trueba\r\n(1821-89), satisfied readers with graceful insipidities, beside which\r\nthe new-comer's manly realism seemed almost crude. The conventional\r\nvillager, simple, Arcadian, and impossible, held the field; and\r\nPereda's revelation of unveiled rusticity was esteemed displeasing,\r\nunnecessary, inartistic. He had to educate his public. From the outset\r\nhe found a few enthusiasts to appreciate him in his native province;\r\nand, by slow degrees, he succeeded in imposing himself first upon the\r\ngeneral audience, and then, with much more difficulty, upon official\r\ncritics. It is commonly alleged against him that even in his more\r\nambitious novels—in _Don Gonzalo González de la Gonzalera_, in _Pedro\r\nSánchez_, where he deals with town life, and in _Sotileza_, which\r\nis salt with the sea—his personages are local. The observation is\r\nintended as a reproach; but, in truth, Pereda's men and women are only\r\nlocal as Sancho Panza and Maritornes are local—local in particulars,\r\nuniversal as types of nature. His true defects are his tendency to\r\nabuse his knowledge of dialect, to insist on a moral aim, to caricature\r\nhis villains. These are spots on the sun. On the whole, he pictures\r\nlife as he sees it, with unblenching fidelity; his people live and\r\nmove; and—not least—he is a master of nervous, energetic phrase. No\r\nwriter outdoes him as a landscape-painter in rendering the fertile\r\nvalleys, the cold hills, the vexed Cantabrian sea, to which he returns\r\nwith the intimate passion of a lover.\r\n\r\nThe representative of a younger school is BENITO PÉREZ GALDÓS (b.\r\n1845), who left the Canary Islands in his nineteenth year with the\r\npurpose of reading law in Madrid. A brief trial of journalism, previous\r\nto the revolution of 1868, led to the publication of his first novel,\r\n_La Fontana de Oro_ (1870), and since 1873 he has shown a wondrous\r\npersistence and suppleness of talent. His _Episodios Nacionales_\r\nalone fill twenty volumes, and as many more exist detached from that\r\nseries. He has composed the modern national epic in the form of novels:\r\nnovels which have for their setting the War of Independence, and the\r\nsucceeding twenty years of civil combat; novels in which not less than\r\nfive hundred characters are presented. Galdós is in singular contrast\r\nwith his friend Pereda. The prejudiced Tory has educated his public;\r\nthe Liberal reformer has been educated by his contemporaries. Galdós\r\nhas always had his fingers on the general pulse; and when the readers\r\nin the late seventies wearied of the historico-political novel, Galdós\r\nwas ready with _La Familia de León Roch_, with _Gloria_, and with\r\n_Doña Perfecta_, in which the religious difficulty is posed ten years\r\nbefore _Robert Elsmere_ was written. His third stage of development is\r\nexampled in _Fortuna y Jacinta_, a most forcible study of contemporary\r\nlife. A prolific inventor, a minute observer of detail, Galdós combines\r\nrealism with fantasy, flat prose with poetic imagination, so that\r\nhe succeeds best in drawing psychological eccentricities like Ángel\r\nGuerra. He is perhaps too Spanish to endure translation, too prone to\r\nassume that his readers are familiar with the minutiæ of Peninsular\r\nlife and history, and his construction, broad as it is, lacks solidity;\r\nbut that he deserves the greater part of his fame is unquestionable,\r\nand if there be doubters, _Fortuna y Jacinta_ and _Ángel Guerra_ are at\r\nhand to vindicate the judgment.\r\n\r\nIn all the length and breadth of Spain no writer (with the possible\r\nexception of that slashing, incorrigible, brilliant reviewer, Antonio\r\nde Valbuena) is better known and more feared than LEOPOLDO ALAS (b.\r\n1852), who uses the pseudonym of Clarín. Alas is often accused of\r\nfierce intolerance as a critic; and the charge has this much truth in\r\nit—that he is righteously, splendidly intolerant of a pretender, a\r\nmountebank, or a dullard. He may be right or wrong in judgment; but\r\nthere is something noble in the intrepidity with which he handles an\r\nestablished reputation, in the infinite malice with which he riddles an\r\nenemy. An ample knowledge of other literatures than his own, a catholic\r\ntaste, as pretty a wit as our days have seen, and a most combative,\r\ngallant spirit make him a critical force which, on the whole, is\r\nused for good. He is not mentioned here, however, as the formidable\r\ngladiator of journalism, but as the author of one of the best\r\ncontemporary novels. _La Regenta_ (1884-1885) is, in the first place,\r\na searching analysis of criminal passion, marked by fine insight; and\r\nthe examination of false mysticism which betrays Ana Ozores is among\r\nthe subtlest, most masterly achievements in recent literature. Galdós\r\nis realistic and persuasive: Alas is real and convincing. He has not\r\nthe cunning of the contriver of situations, and as he never condescends\r\nto the novelist's artifice, he imperils his chance of popularity. In\r\ntruth, far from enjoying a vulgar vogue, _La Regenta_ has had the\r\ndistinction of being condemned by criticasters who have never read it.\r\n_Su único Hijo_, and the collection of short stories entitled _Pipá_,\r\ninteresting and finished in detail, are of slighter substance and\r\nvalue. The duties of a law professorship at the University of Oviedo,\r\nthe tasks of journalism, have occupied Alas during the last four years.\r\nLiterature in Spain is but a poor crutch, and even the popular Valera\r\nhas told us that he must perish did he depend upon his pen. Spanish men\r\nof letters have to be content with fame. Meanwhile, it is known that\r\nAlas is at work upon the long-promised _Esperaindeo_, in which we may\r\nfairly hope to find a companion to _La Regenta_.\r\n\r\nOf ARMANDO PALACIO VALDÉS (b. 1853) it can hardly be said that he\r\nhas fulfilled the promise of _Marta y María_ and _La Hermana de San\r\nSulpicio_. Alas, with whom Palacio Valdés collaborated in a critical\r\nreview of the literature of 1881, has succeeded in absorbing the\r\ngood elements of the modern French naturalistic school without\r\nlosing his Spanish savour. Palacio Valdés has surrendered great part\r\nof his nationality in _Espuma_ and in _La Fe_, which might, with a\r\nchange of names, be taken for translations of French novels. He has\r\nabundant cleverness, a sure hand in construction, a distinct power of\r\ncharacter-drawing, which have won him more consideration out of Spain\r\nthan in it, and he has a fair claim to rank as the chief of the modern\r\nnaturalistic school. His most distinguished rival is the Galician,\r\nthe Sra. Quiroga, better known by her maiden name of EMILIA PARDO\r\nBAZÁN (b. 1851), the best authoress that Spain has produced during\r\nthe present century. Her earliest effort was a prize essay on Feijóo\r\n(1876), followed by a volume of verses which I have never seen, and\r\nupon which the writer is satisfied that oblivion should scatter its\r\npoppy. She pleases most in picturesque description of country life and\r\nmanners in her province, of scenes in La Coruña, which she glorifies\r\nin her writings as Marineda. Her foundation of a critical review, the\r\n_Nuevo Teatro Crítico_, written entirely by herself, showed confidence\r\nand enterprise, and enabled her to propagate her eclectic views on life\r\nand art. Women have hitherto been more impressionable than original,\r\nand Doña Emilia has been drawn into the French naturalistic current in\r\n_Los Pazos de Ulloa_ (1886) and in _La Madre Naturaleza_ (1887). Both\r\nnovels contain episodes of remarkable power, and _La Madre Naturaleza_\r\nis an almost epical glorification of primitive instincts. But Spain\r\nhas a native realism of her own, and it is scarcely probable that\r\nthe French variety will ever supersede it. It is as a naturalistic\r\nnovelist that the Sra. Pardo Bazán is generally known; but the fashion\r\nof naturalism is already passing, and it is by the rich colouring, the\r\nlocal knowledge, the patriotic enthusiasm, and the exact vision of such\r\ntranscripts of local scene and custom as abound in _De mi tierra_ that\r\nshe best conveys the impressions of an exuberant and even irresistible\r\ntemperament. What Pereda has accomplished for the land of the mountain\r\nthe Sra. Pardo Bazán has, in lesser measure, done for Galicia.\r\n\r\nOne must hold it against her that she should have aided in establishing\r\nthe trivial vogue of the Jesuit, LUIS COLOMA (b. 1851), whose\r\n_Pequeñeces_ (1890) caused more sensation than any novel of the last\r\ntwenty years. Palacio Valdés has been severely censured for writing,\r\nin _Espuma_, of \"society\" in which he has never moved. \"What,\" asked\r\nIsaac Disraeli, \"what does my son know about dukes?\" The Padre Coloma's\r\nacquaintance with dukes is extensive and peculiar. Born at Jerez de\r\nla Frontera, he came under the influence of Fernán Caballero, whom he\r\nhas pictured in _El Viernes de Dolores_, and with whom he collaborated\r\nin _Juan Miseria_. His lively youth was spent in drawing-rooms where\r\nAlfonsist plots were hatched; and when, at the age of twenty-three, he\r\njoined the Society of Jesus after receiving a mysterious bullet-wound\r\nwhich brought him to death's door, he knew as much of Madrid \"society\"\r\nas any man in Spain. His literary mission appears to be to satirise\r\nthe Spanish aristocracy, and _Pequeñeces_ is his capital effort in\r\nthat kind. An angry controversy followed, in which Valera made one of\r\nhis few mistakes by taking the field against Coloma, who, with all his\r\nsuperficial smartness, is a special pleader and not an artist. A _roman\r\nà clef_ is always sure of ephemeral success, and readers were too\r\nintent on identifying the originals of Currita Albornoz and Villamelón\r\nto observe that _Pequeñeces_ was a hasty improvisation, void of plot\r\nand character and truth and style. Certain scenes are good enough to\r\npass as episodical caricatures, and had the Padre Coloma the endowment\r\nof wit and gaiety and distinction, he might hope to develop into a\r\nclerical Gyp. As it is, he has shot his bolt, achieved a notoriety\r\nwhich is even now fading, and is in a fair way to be dethroned from his\r\nposition by Vicente Blasco Ibáñez, the author of _Flor de Mayo_, and by\r\nJuan Ochoa, the writer of _Un Alma de Dios_. These two novelists, the\r\nrising hopes of the immediate future, are rapidly growing in repute as\r\nin accomplishment. Narcís Oller y Moragas (b. 1846) has shown singular\r\ngifts in such tales as _L'Escanyapobres_, _Vilaníu_, and _Viva\r\nEspanya_. But, as he writes in Catalan, we have no immediate concern\r\nwith him here.\r\n\r\nOf the modern Spanish theatre there is little originality to report.\r\nTamayo's successor in popular esteem is JOSÉ ECHEGARAY (1832), who\r\nfirst came into notice as a mathematician, a political economist, a\r\nrevolutionary orator, and a minister of the short-lived republic.\r\nWriting under the obvious anagram of Jorge Hayeseca, Echegaray first\r\nattempted the drama so late as 1874, and has since then succeeded and\r\nfailed with innumerable pieces. He is essentially a romantic, as he\r\nproves in _La Esposa del Vengador_ and in _Ó Locura ó Santidad_; but\r\nthere is nothing distinctively national in his work, which continually\r\nreflects the passing fashions of the moment. His plays are commonly\r\nwell constructed, as one might expect from a mathematician applying his\r\nscience to the scene, and he has a certain power of gloomy realisation,\r\nas in _El Gran Galeoto_, which moves and impresses; yet he has created\r\nno character, he delights in cheap effects, and when he betakes himself\r\nto verse, is prone to a banality which is almost vulgar. A delightfully\r\nmiddle-class writer, his appreciation by middle-class audiences calls\r\nfor no special comment. It even speaks for itself.\r\n\r\nThe drama has also been attempted by GASPAR NÚÑEZ DE ARCE (b.\r\n1834), whose _Haz de Leña_, in which Felipe II. figures, is the most\r\ndistinguished historical drama of the century, written with a reserve\r\nand elegance rare on the modern Spanish stage. Núñez de Arce, however,\r\nthough he began with a successful play in his fifteenth year, was well\r\nadvised when he forsook the scene and gave himself to pure lyrism.\r\nHis disillusioning political experiences as Secretary of State for\r\nthe Colonies have reduced him to silence during the last few years.\r\nHe was born to sing songs of victory, to be the poet of ordered\r\nliberty, and circumstances have cast his lot in times of disaster\r\nand revolutionary excess. He has had no opportunity of celebrating a\r\nnational triumph, and his hopes of a golden age, to be brought about by\r\na few constitutional changes, have been grievously disappointed. Yet\r\nit is as a political singer that he has won a present fame and that he\r\nwill pass onward to renown. His _Idilio_ is a rustic love story of fine\r\nsimplicity, of an impressive, pure realism which lifts it above the\r\ncommon level of pastoral poems, and its sincerity, its austere finish,\r\nare characteristic of the poet, who is always a scrupulous artist, a\r\npassionate devotee and observer of nature, as he has proved once more\r\nin _La Pesca_. In _Raimundo Lulio_, Núñez de Arce's superb execution\r\nis displayed with a superb result which almost tempts the coldest\r\nreader into pardoning the confusion of two separate themes—allegory\r\nand amorism. But a political poet he remains, and the famous _Gritos\r\nde Combate_ (1875), in which he denounces anarchy, pleads for freedom\r\nand for concord, with a civic courage beyond all praise, is a lasting\r\nmonument in its kind. Modern Castilian shows no poetic figure to\r\ncompare with him, and the only promises of our time are Jacinto\r\nVerdaguer and Joan Maragall, two Catalan singers who fall without our\r\nlimit.\r\n\r\nThe present century has produced no great Spanish historian, though\r\nthere has been an active movement of historical research, headed\r\nby scholars like Fidel Fita, specialists like Cárdenas, Azcárate,\r\nCosta, Pérez Pujol, Ribera, Jiménez de la Espada, Fernández Duro,\r\nand Hinojosa, all of whom have produced brilliant monographs, or\r\nhave accumulated valuable materials for the Mariana of the future.\r\nIn criticism also there has been a marked advance of scholarship and\r\ntolerance, thanks to the example of MARCELINO MENÉNDEZ Y PELAYO (b.\r\n1856), whose extraordinary learning and argumentative acuteness were\r\nfirst shown in his _Ciencia Española_ (1878), and his _Historia de\r\nlos Heterodoxos Españoles_ (1880-81). Since then the slight touch of\r\nacerbity, of provincial narrowness, has disappeared, the writer's\r\ntalent has matured, and, starting as the standard-bearer of an\r\naggressive party, anxious to recover lost ground, his sympathies have\r\nwidened as his erudition has taken deeper root, till at the present\r\nmoment he is accepted by his ancient foes as the most sagacious and\r\naccomplished of Spanish critics. His _Odas, Epístolas y Tragedias_, is\r\na signal instance of technical excellence in versification, containing\r\nas good a version of the _Isles of Greece_ as any foreigner has\r\nachieved. But, after all, it is not as poet, but as critic, as literary\r\nhistorian, that he is hailed by his countrymen as a prodigy. He has,\r\nperhaps, undertaken too much, and the editing of Lope de Vega may cause\r\nthe _Historia de las Ideas Estéticas en España_ to remain an unfinished\r\ntorso; but his example and influence have been wholly exercised\r\nfor good, and are evident in the excellent work of the younger\r\ngeneration—the work of Emilio Cotarelo y Mori, of Rafael Altamira\r\ny Crevea, of Ramón Menéndez Pidal. It would be a singular thing if\r\nthe bright, improvident Spain, which to most of us stands for the\r\nembodiment of reckless romanticism, were to produce a race of writers\r\nof the German type, a breed absorbed in detail and minute observation;\r\nand as a nation's genius is no more subject to change than is the\r\ntemperament of individuals, the development may not come to pass. But,\r\nas the century closes, the tendency inclines that way.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[31] See the _Revue hispanique_ (Paris, 1894), vol. i. pp. 236-257.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                         BIBLIOGRAPHICAL NOTE\r\n\r\n\r\nGeorge Ticknor's great _History of Spanish Literature_ (Boston, 1872)\r\nis the widest survey of the subject; it should be read in the Castilian\r\nversion of Pascual de Gayangos and Enrique de Vedia (1851-56),[32] or\r\nin the German of Nikolaus Heinrich Julius (Leipzig, 1852), both of\r\nwhich contain valuable supplementary matter. Ludwig Gustav Lemcke shows\r\ntaste and learning and independence in his _Handbuch der spanischen\r\nLiteratur_ (Leipzig, 1855-56). On a smaller scale are Eugène Baret's\r\n_Histoire de la littérature espagnole_ (1863), the volume contributed\r\nby Jacques Claude Demogeot to Victor Duruy's series entitled\r\n_Histoire des littératures étrangères_ (1880), Licurgo Cappelletti's\r\n_Letteratura spagnuola_ (Milan, 1882), and Mr. H. Butler Clarke's\r\n_Spanish Literature_ (1893). Ferdinand Wolf's _Studien zur Geschichte\r\nder spanischen und portugiesischen Nationalliteratur_ (Berlin, 1859)\r\nis a most masterly study of the early period; the Castilian version\r\nby D. Miguel de Unamuno, with notes by D. Marcelino Menéndez y Pelayo\r\n(1895-96), corrects some of Wolf's conclusions in the light of recent\r\nresearch. The _Darstellung der spanischen Literatur im Mittelalter_\r\n(Mainz, 1846), by Ludwig Clarus, whose real name was Wilhelm Volk, is\r\nlearned and suggestive, though too enthusiastic in criticism. José\r\nAmador de los Ríos' seven volumes, entitled _Historia crítica de la\r\nliteratura española_ (1861-65), end with the reign of the Catholic\r\nKings: an alphabetical index would greatly increase the value of this\r\nmonumental work. The Comte Théodore Joseph Boudet de Puymaigre's two\r\nvolumes, _Les vieux auteurs castillans_ (1888-90), give the facts in a\r\nvery agreeable, unpretentious way.\r\n\r\nAmong current handbooks by Spanish authors, those by Antonio Gil y\r\nZárate (1844), Manuel de la Revilla and Pedro de Alcántara García\r\n(1884), F. Sánchez de Castro (1890), and Prudencio Mudarra y Párraga\r\n(Sevilla, 1895), are well-meant, and are, one hopes, useful for\r\nexamination purposes. José Fernández-Espino's _Curso histórico-crítico_\r\n(Sevilla, 1871) is excellent; but it ends with Cervantes' prose works,\r\nand makes no reference to the Spanish theatre.\r\n\r\nOn the drama there is nothing to match Adolf Friedrich von Schack's\r\n_Geschichte der dramatischen Literatur und Kunst in Spanien_ (Berlin,\r\n1845-46) and his _Nachträge_ (Frankfurt am Main, 1854). Romualdo\r\nÁlvarez Espino's _Ensayo histórico-crítico del teatro español_\r\n(Cádiz, 1876), containing long extracts from the chief dramatists,\r\nis serviceable to beginners. The late Cayetano Barrera's _Catálogo\r\nbibliográfico y biográfico del teatro antiguo español_ (1860) is\r\ninvaluable: lack of funds causes the supplement to remain \"inedited.\"\r\n\r\nIn bibliography Castilian is richer than English. Nicolás Antonio's\r\n_Bibliotheca Hispana Nova_ (1783-88) and _Bibliotheca Hispana Vetus_\r\n(1788) are wonderful for their time. Bartolomé José Gallardo's _Ensayo\r\nde una Biblioteca española de libros raros y curiosos_ (1863-89) owes\r\nmuch to its editors, the Marqués de la Fuensanta del Valle and D. José\r\nSancho Rayón. For old editions Pedro Salvá y Mallén's _Catálogo de la\r\nbiblioteca de Salvá_ (Valencia, 1872) may be consulted. An admirable\r\nmonthly bibliography of new books is issued by D. Rafael Altamira y\r\nCrevea in his _Revista crítica de historia y literatura españolas,\r\nportuguesas é hispano-americanas_. Murillo's monthly _Boletín_ is a\r\nmere sale list.\r\n\r\nM. Foulché-Delbosc's _Revue hispanique_ and Sr. Altamira's _Revista\r\ncrítica_ are specially dedicated to our subject; the zeal and\r\nself-sacrifice of both editors have earned the gratitude of all\r\nstudents of Spanish literature. MM. Gaston Paris' and Paul Meyer's\r\n_Romania_ frequently contains admirable essays and reviews by MM.\r\nMorel-Fatio, Cornu, Cuervo, and others; as much may be said for Gustav\r\nGröber's _Zeitschrift für romanische Philologie_ (Halle), and for the\r\n_Giornale storico della letteratura italiana_ (Torino), edited by MM.\r\nFrancesco Novati and Rodolfo Renier.\r\n\r\nSr. Menéndez y Pelayo's _Historia de las Ideas estéticas en España_\r\n(1883-91) touches literature at many points, and abounds in acute\r\nand suggestive reflections. Two treatises by M. Arturo Farinelli,\r\n_Die Beziehungen zwischen Spanien und Deutschland in der Litteratur\r\nder beiden Länder_ (Berlin, 1892), and _Spanien und die spanische\r\nLitteratur im Lichte der deutschen Kritik und Poesie_ (Berlin, 1892),\r\nare remarkable for curious learning and appreciative criticism.\r\n\r\nThe best general collection of classics is Manuel Rivadeneyra's\r\n_Biblioteca de Autores españoles_ (1846-80), which consists of\r\nseventy-nine volumes. Sr. Menéndez y Pelayo's _Antología de poetas\r\nlíricos castellanos_ (1890-96) is supplied with very learned and\r\nelaborate introductions.\r\n\r\n\r\n                               CHAPTER I\r\n\r\nThe _Leloaren Cantua_ and _Altobiskar Cantua_ are given, with\r\nEnglish renderings, in Mr. Wentworth Webster's admirable _Basque\r\nLegends_ (1879); an exposure of the _Altobiskar_ hoax by the same\r\ngreat authority is printed in the Academy of History's _Boletín_\r\n(1883). Rafael and Pedro Rodríguez Mohedano display much discursive,\r\nuncritical erudition in their ten-volumed _Historia literaria en\r\nEspaña_ (1768-85), which deals only with the early period. A recent\r\nstudy (1888) on Prudentius by the Conde de Viñaza deserves mention.\r\nMigne's _Patrologia Latina_ includes the chief Spanish Fathers. In\r\nthe fourth volume of Charles Cahier's and Arthur Martin's _Nouveaux\r\nMélanges d'archéologie, d'histoire, et de littérature sur le moyen âge_\r\n(1877) there is a brilliant essay on the Gothic period by the Rev. Père\r\nJules Tailhan, to whom we also owe a splendid edition of the Rhymed\r\nChronicle, the _Epitoma Imperatorum_ (Paris, 1885), by the Anonymous\r\nWriter of Córdoba.\r\n\r\nFor the Spanish Jews, Hirsch Grätz' _Geschichte der Juden von\r\nden ältesten Zeiten bis auf die Gegenwart_ (Leipzig, 1865-90) is\r\nthe best guide. Salomon Munk's _Mélanges de philosophie juive et\r\narabe_ (1857) is not yet superseded, and Abraham Geiger's _Divan\r\ndes Castilier Abu'l Hassan Juda ha Levi_ (Breslau, 1851) contains\r\ninformation not to be found elsewhere. M. Kayserling's _Biblioteca\r\nEspañola—Portugeza—Judaica_ (Strassburg, 1890) is extremely valuable.\r\n\r\nTwo works by Reinhart Pieter Anne Dozy are authoritative as regards\r\nthe Arab period: the _Histoire des Mussulmans d'Espagne_ (Leyde,\r\n1861), and the _Recherches sur l'histoire politique et littéraire\r\nde l'Espagne pendant le moyen âge_ (1881). The first edition of the\r\n_Recherches_ (Leyde, 1849) embodies many suggestive passages cancelled\r\nin the reprints. Schack's _Poesie und Kunst der Araber in Spanien\r\nund Sicilien_ (Stuttgart, 1877) is a good general survey, a little\r\ntoo enthusiastic in tone; it greatly gains in the Castilian version,\r\nmade from the first edition, by D. Juan Valera (1867-71). Nicolas\r\nLucien Leclerc's _Histoire de la médecine arabe_ (1876) is of much\r\nwider scope than its title implies, and may be profitably consulted\r\non Arab achievements in other fields. Francisco Javier Simonet states\r\nthe case against the predominance of Arab culture in the preface to\r\nhis _Glosario de voces ibéricas y latinas usadas entre los Muzárabes_\r\n(1888). D. Julián Ribera's learned _Orígenes de la justicia en Aragón_\r\n(Zaragoza, 1897) deals with the facts in a more judicial spirit. Of\r\nspecial monographs Ernest Renan's _Averroès et l'Averroïsme_ (1866) is\r\na recognised classic. The greater part of the codex from the Convent of\r\nSanto Domingo de Silos, now in the British Museum (Add. MSS. 30,853),\r\nhas been published by Dr. Joseph Priebsch in the _Zeitschrift_, vol.\r\nxix.\r\n\r\nAs regards the Provençal influence in the Peninsula, Manuel Milá y\r\nFontanals' _Trovadores en España_ (Barcelona, 1887) is a definitive\r\nwork. Eugène Baret's _Espagne et Provence_ (1857) is pleasing but\r\nsuperficial. Theophilo Braga's learned introduction to the _Cancioneiro\r\nPortuguez da Vaticana_ (Lisbon, 1878) is brilliantly suggestive,\r\nthough inaccurate in detail. The counter-current from Northern France,\r\nas it affects the epic, is treated in Milá y Fontanals' _Poesía\r\nheróico-popular castellana_ (Barcelona, 1874).\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER II\r\n\r\nThe _Misterio de los Reyes Magos_ is most accessible in Amador de\r\nlos Ríos' _Historia_, vol. iii. pp. 658-60, and in K. A. Martin\r\nHartmann's dissertation, _Ueber das altspanische Dreikönnigsspiel_\r\n(Bautzen, 1879). The Swedish scholar, Eduard Lidforss, printed the\r\n_Misterio_ in the _Jahrbuch für romanische und englische Literatur_\r\n(Leipzig, 1871), vol. xii., and Professor Georg Baist's diplomatic\r\nedition appeared at Erlangen in 1879. Arturo Grafs _Studii drammatici_\r\n(Torino, 1878) contains an interesting essay on the Magi play; M.\r\nMorel-Fatio's article in _Romania_, vol. ix., and Baist's review in the\r\n_Zeitschrift_, vol. iv., are both important. D'Ancona's _Origini del\r\nteatro italiano_ (Torino, 1891) discusses the question of the play's\r\ndate with much shrewdness and caution.\r\n\r\nThe most convenient reference for the _Poema del Cid_ is to\r\nRivadeneyra, vol. lvii. D. Ramón Menéndez Pidal's edition (1898)\r\nsupersedes all others: next, in order of merit, come Karl Vollmöller's\r\n(Halle, 1879), Eduard Lidforss', called _Cantares de Myo Cid_ (Lund,\r\n1895), and Mr. Archer Huntington's (New York, 1897). The _Cantar\r\nde Rodrigo_ is in Rivadeneyra, vol. xvi.; vol. lvii. contains the\r\n_Apolonio_, the _Vida de Santa María Egipciacqua_, and the _Tres Reyes\r\ndorient_. The sources of _Santa María Egipciacqua_ are indicated by\r\nAdolf Mussafia in the _Sitzungsberichte_ of the Vienna Academy of\r\nSciences, vol. clxiii. For the _Disputa del Alma y Cuerpo_ see the\r\n_Zeitschrift_, vol. lx. M. Morel-Fatio edited the _Debate entre el Agua\r\ny el Vino_ and the _Razón feita de Amor in Romania_, vol. xvi. Most\r\nof the foregoing may be read in extract in Egidio Gorra's excellent\r\nanthology, _Lingua e Letteratura Spagnuola delle origini_ (Milan, 1898).\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER III\r\n\r\nMost of the writers referred to in this chapter are included in\r\nRivadeneyra, vols. li. and lvii. A valuable article on Berceo by D.\r\nFrancisco Fernández y González, now Dean of the Central University,\r\nwas published in _La Razón_ (1857): a translated fragment of Berceo is\r\ngiven by Longfellow in _Outre-Mer_. Gautier de Coinci's _Les Miracles\r\nde la Sainte Vierge_ were edited by the Abbé Alexandre Eusèbe Poquet\r\n(1857) in a somewhat prudish spirit. M. Morel-Fatio's study on the\r\n_Libro de Alexandre_, printed in the fourth volume of _Romania_, is an\r\nextremely thorough performance.\r\n\r\nAlfonso's _Siete Partidas_ (1807) and the _Fuero Juzgo_ (1815) have\r\nbeen issued by the Spanish Academy; his scientific work is partially\r\nrepresented by Manuel Rico y Sinobas' five folios entitled _Libros\r\ndel Saber de Astronomía_ (1863-67). There is no modern edition of\r\nhis histories, and a reprint is greatly needed: the inaugural speech\r\nof D. Juan Facundo Riaño, read before the Academy of History (1869),\r\ntraces the sources with great ability and learning. The translations\r\nin which Alfonso shared are best read in Hermann Knust's _Mitteilungen\r\naus dem Eskorial_ (vol. cxli. of the publications issued by the\r\nStuttgart Literarischer Verein), and in Knust's _Dos Obras didácticas\r\ny dos Leyendas_ (1878). Alfonso's _Cantigas de Santa María_ have been\r\npublished by the Spanish Academy (1889) in two of the handsomest\r\nvolumes ever printed; the Marqués de Valmar has edited the text, and\r\nsupplied an admirable introduction and apparatus.\r\n\r\nFadrique's _Engannos e Assayamientos de las Mogieres_ is to be sought\r\nin Domenico Comparetti's _Ricerche intorno al libro di Sindibad_\r\n(Milan, 1869). The questions arising out of the _Gran Conquista de\r\nUltramar_ are discussed by M. Gaston Paris, with his usual lucidity and\r\nlearning, in _Romania_, vols. xvii., xix., and xxii.\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER IV\r\n\r\nMost of the poems mentioned are printed in Rivadeneyra, vol. lvii.\r\n_Solomon's Rhymed Proverbs_ are included by Antonio Paz y Melia in\r\n_Opúsculos literarios de los siglos XIV.-XVI._ (1892). The _Poema\r\nde José_ has been reproduced in Arabic characters by Heinrich Morf\r\n(Leipzig, 1883) as part of a _Gratulationsschrift_ from the University\r\nof Bern to that of Zurich.\r\n\r\nJuan Manuel's writings were edited by Gayangos in Rivadeneyra, vol.\r\nli.: we owe his _Libro de Caza_ to Professor Georg Baist (Halle, 1880),\r\nand a valuable edition of the _Libro del Caballero et del Escudero_ to\r\nS. Gräfenberg (Erlangen, 1883). Alfonso XI.'s handbook on hunting is\r\ngiven by Gutiérrez de la Vega in the third volume of the _Biblioteca\r\nVenatoria_ (Madrid, 1879). Ayala's history forms vols. i. and ii. of\r\nEugenio de Llaguno Amírola's _Crónicas Españolas_ (Madrid, 1779).\r\n\r\n\r\n                               CHAPTER V\r\n\r\nThe Comte de Puymaigre's _La Cour littéraire de Don Juan II._ (1873) is\r\nan excellent general view of the subject. D. Emilio Cotarelo y Mori's\r\n_Don Enrique de Villena_ (1896) is a very learned and interesting\r\nstudy. Villena's _Arte Cisoria_ was reprinted so recently as 1879.\r\nThe _Libro de los Gatos_ and Clemente Sánchez' _Exemplos_ are in\r\nRivadeneyra, vol. li.; the latter were completed by M. Morel-Fatio in\r\n_Romania_, vol. vii. Mr. Thomas Frederick Crane's _Exempla_ of Jacques\r\nVitry (published in 1890 for the Folk-Lore Society) will be found\r\nuseful by English readers.\r\n\r\nBaena's _Cancionero_ (1851) was edited by the late Marqués de Pidal:\r\nthe large-paper copies contain a few loose pieces, omitted from the\r\nordinary edition which was reprinted by Brockhaus in a cheap form at\r\nLeipzig in 1860. D. Antonio Paz y Melia's _Obras de Juan Rodríguez de\r\nla Cámara_ (1884) is a good example of this scholar's conscientious\r\nwork. Amador de los Ríos' edition of the _Obras del Marqués de\r\nSantillana_ (1852) is complete and minute in detail.\r\n\r\nThere is no good edition of Juan de Mena's works; I have found it\r\nmost convenient to use that published by Francisco Sánchez (1804).\r\nThe _Coplas de la Panadera_ will be found in Gallardo, vol. i. cols.\r\n613-617.\r\n\r\nJuan II.'s _Crónica_ is printed by Rivadeneyra, vol. lviii.; the\r\nothers—those of Clavijo, Gámez, Lena—are in Llaguno y Amírola's\r\n_Crónicas Españolas_, already named. Llaguno also reprinted Pérez de\r\nGuzmán's _Generaciones_ at Valencia in 1790.\r\n\r\nNo modern editor has had the spirit to reissue Martínez de Toledo's\r\n_Corbacho_, nor did even Ticknor possess a copy. The edition of Logroño\r\n(1529) is convenient. The _Visión deleitable_ is in Rivadeneyra, vol.\r\nxxxvi. I know no later edition of Lucena's _Vita Beata_ than that of\r\nZamora, 1483.\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER VI\r\n\r\nHernando del Castillo's _Cancionero General_ should be read in the fine\r\nedition (1882) published by the Sociedad de Bibliófilos Españoles; the\r\n_Cancionero de burlas_ in Luis de Usoz y Río's reprint (London, 1841).\r\nThe Marqués de la Fuensanta del Valle and D. José Sancho Rayón edited\r\nLope de Stúñiga's _Cancionero_ in 1872. While the present volume has\r\nbeen passing through the press, M. Foulché-Delbosc has, for the first\r\ntime, published the entire text of the _Coplas del Provincial_ in the\r\n_Revue hispanique_, vol. v. The _Coplas de Mingo Revulgo_, Cota's\r\n_Diálogo_, and Jorge Manrique's _Coplas_ are best read in D. Marcelino\r\nMenéndez y Pelayo's _Antología_, vols. iii. and iv. An additional\r\npiece of Cota's, discovered by M. Foulché-Delbosc, has been printed\r\nin the _Revue hispanique_, vol. i.; and to D. Antonio Paz y Melia is\r\ndue the publication of Gómez Manrique's _Cancionero_ (1885). Iñigo\r\nde Mendoza and Ambrosio Montesino are represented in Rivadeneyra,\r\nvol. xxxv. Miguel del Riego y Núñez' edition of Padilla appeared\r\nat London in 1841 in the _Colección de obras poéticas españolas_.\r\nPedro de Urrea's _Cancionero_ (1876) forms the second volume of the\r\n_Biblioteca de Escritores Aragoneses_. Encina's _Teatro completo_ has\r\nbeen admirably edited (1893) by Francisco Asenjo Barbieri: a suggestive\r\nand penetrating criticism by Sr. Cotarelo y Mori appeared in _España\r\nModerna_ (May 1894).\r\n\r\nPalencia is to be studied sufficiently in his _Dos Tratados_ (1876),\r\narranged by D. Antonio María Fabié. The _Crónica_ of Lucas Iranzo was\r\ngiven by the Academy of History (1853) in the _Memorial histórico\r\nespañol_. _Amadís de Gaula_ is most easily read in Rivadeneyra, vol.\r\nxl., which is preceded by a very instructive preface, the work of\r\nGayangos. The derivation of the _Amadís_ romance is ably discussed\r\nfrom different points of view by Eugène Baret in his _Études sur la\r\nredaction espagnole de l'Amadis de Gaule_ (1853); by Theophilo Braga in\r\nhis _Historia das novelas portuguezas de cavalleria_ (Porto, 1873);\r\nand by Ludwig Braunfels in his _Kritischer Versuch über den Roman\r\nAmadís von Gallien_ (Leipzig, 1876). The fourth volume of Ormsby's _Don\r\nQuixote_ (1885) contains an exhaustive bibliography of the chivalresque\r\nnovels, most of which are both costly and worthless. Of the _Celestina_\r\nthere are innumerable editions; the handiest is that in Rivadeneyra,\r\nvol. iii. A reprint of Mabbe's splendid English version (1631) was\r\nincluded by Mr. Henley in his _Tudor Translations_ (1894). D. Marcelino\r\nMenéndez y Pelayo's brilliant essay on Rojas is reprinted in the second\r\nseries of his _Estudios de crítica literaria_ (1895). Bernáldez'\r\n_Historia de los Reyes católicos_ (Granada, 1856) has been carefully\r\nproduced by Miguel Lafuente y Alcántara. Pulgar's _Claros Varones_\r\nwas inserted at the end of Llaguno y Amírola's edition of the _Centón\r\nepistolario_ (1775). It is quite impossible to give any notion of the\r\nimmense mass of literature concerning Columbus; but anything bearing\r\nthe names of Martín Fernández de Navarrete or of Mr. Henry Harrisse is\r\nentitled to the greatest respect.\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER VII\r\n\r\nM. Morel-Fatio's _L'Espagne au 16^e et 17^e siécle_ (Heilbronn, 1878)\r\nis invaluable for this period and the succeeding century. Dr. Adam\r\nSchneider's _Spaniens Anteil an der deutschen Litteratur des 16. und\r\n17. Jahrhunderts_ (Strassburg, 1898) is a work of immense industry,\r\ncontaining much curious information in a convenient form. English\r\nreaders will find an excellent summary of the literary history of this\r\ntime in Mr. David Hannay's _Later Renaissance_ (1898).\r\n\r\nManuel Cañete, whose _Teatro español del siglo XVI._ (1885) is useful\r\nbut ill arranged, included a single volume of Torres Naharro's\r\n_Propaladia_ among the _Libros de Antaño_ so long ago as 1880; the\r\nsecond is still to come, and those who would read this dramatist\r\nmust turn to the rare sixteenth-century editions. Perhaps the best\r\nreprint of Gil Vicente is that issued at Hamburg in 1834 by José\r\nVictorino Barreto Feio and José Gomes Monteiro; a most complete\r\naccount of Vicente, his environment and influence, is given by\r\nTheophilo Braga in the seventh volume of his learned _Historia de la\r\nlitteratura portuguesa_ (Porto, 1898). Boscán's Castilian version of\r\nthe _Cortegiano_ was reissued in 1873; the completest edition of his\r\nverse is that published by Professor Knapp (of Yale University), issued\r\nat Madrid in 1873. Professor Flamini's _Studi di storia letteraria\r\nitaliana e straniera_ (Livorno, 1895) contains a very scholarly essay\r\non the debt of Boscán to Bernardo Tasso. The poems of Garcilaso are\r\nin Rivadeneyra, vols. xxxii. and xlii.; but a far pleasanter book to\r\nhandle is Azara's edition (1765). Benedetto Croce's study entitled\r\n_Intorno al soggiorno di Garcilaso de la Vega in Italia_ (1894)\r\nappeared originally in the _Rassegna storica napoletana di lettere ed\r\narte_ (a magazine which deserves to be better known in England than\r\nit is). Croce's researches have been printed apart, and we may look\r\nforward to his publishing others no less important. Jeremiah Holmes\r\nWiffen's biography and translation of Garcilaso (1823) are defective,\r\nbut nothing better exists in English. Few poets in the world have\r\nbeen so fortunate in their editors as Sâ de Miranda. Mme. Carolina\r\nMichaëlis de Vasconcellos' reprint (Halle, 1881), with its very learned\r\napparatus of introduction, notes, and variants, is a real achievement\r\nunsurpassed in the history of editing. A fine edition of Gutierre de\r\nCetina has been published (Seville, 1895) with a scholarly introduction\r\nby D. Joaquín Hazañas y la Rua. Acuña's works appeared at Madrid in\r\n1804; his _Contienda de Ayax_ is in the second volume of López de\r\nSedano's _Parnaso Español_ (1778). Concerning Mendoza, the reader may\r\nprofitably turn to Charles Graux' _Essai sur les origines du fona grec\r\nde l'Escorial_ (1880), published in the _Bibliothèque de l'École des\r\nHautes Études_. Professor Knapp edited Mendoza's verses in 1877: a\r\ncreditable piece of work, though inferior to his edition of Boscán.\r\nCastillejo and Silvestre are exampled in Rivadeneyra, vol. xxxii. Of\r\nVillegas' _Inventario_ there is no modern reprint.\r\n\r\nGuevara is sufficiently represented in Rivadeneyra, vol. lxv.; the\r\nEnglish versions by Lord Berners, North, Fenton, Hellowes, and others,\r\nare of exceptional merit and interest.\r\n\r\nThe most important historians of the Indies are reprinted by\r\nRivadeneyra, vols. xxii. and xxvi. Amador de los Ríos edited Oviedo for\r\nthe Academy of History in 1851-55. Very full details concerning Cortés\r\nare given by Prescott in his classic book on Peru, and Sir Arthur\r\nHelps' _Life of Las Casas_ (1868) is a pleasing piece of partisanship.\r\n\r\n_Lazarillo de Tormes_ should be read in Mr. Butler Clarke's beautiful\r\nreproduction of the _princeps_ (1897). M. Morel-Fatio's essay in the\r\nfirst series of his _Études sur l'Espagne_ (1895) is exceedingly\r\ningenious, but, like all negative criticism, it is somewhat\r\nunconvincing. His guess that _Lazarillo_ was written by some one\r\nconnected with the Valdés clique does not seem very happy, but even a\r\nconjecture by M. Morel-Fatio carries great weight.\r\n\r\nEduard Böhmer gives a very full bibliography of Juan de Valdés in his\r\n_Biblioteca Wiffeniana_ (Strassburg, 1874). Benjamin Barron Wiffen\r\nhad for Valdés a kind of cult which found partial expression in his\r\nquarto _Life and Writings of Juan Valdés, otherwise Valdesio_ (1865).\r\nBut it is impossible to give more minute references to the voluminous\r\nliterature which deals with Valdés and his brother Alfonso. An\r\nhistorical essay by Manuel Carrasco, published at Geneva in 1880, is\r\ninteresting as the work of a modern Spanish Protestant.\r\n\r\n\r\n                             CHAPTER VIII\r\n\r\nThe Marqués de la Fuensanta del Valle's edition of Lope de Rueda\r\n(1894) lacks an introduction, but it is in other respects as good\r\nas possible. D. Ángel Lasso de la Vega y Arguëlles has published a\r\n_Historia y Juicio crítico de la Escuela Poética Sevillana_ (1871),\r\nwhich is useful, and even exhaustive, though far too eulogistic in\r\ntone. The Argensolas may be conveniently studied in Rivadeneyra, vol.\r\nxlii., which is supplemented by the Conde de Viñaza's collection of the\r\n_Poesías sueltas_ (1889). Minor dramatists still await republication.\r\nHerrera is easiest read in Rivadeneyra, vol. xxxii.; M. Morel-Fatio's\r\ncritical edition of the Lepanto Ode (Paris, 1893) is of great merit,\r\nand an essay on Herrera by M. Édouard Bourciez in the _Annales de\r\nla Faculté des lettres de Bordeaux_ (1891) is acute and suggestive.\r\nVicente de la Fuente is the editor of Santa Teresa's writings in\r\nRivadeneyra, vols. liii. and lv. The biography by Mrs. Cunninghame\r\nGraham (1894), a work both learned and picturesque, presents rather the\r\nwoman of genius than the canonised saint. The text of the remaining\r\nmystics will, with few exceptions, be found in Rivadeneyra, vols. vi.,\r\nviii., ix., xxvii., and xxxii. The lesser lights exist only in editions\r\nof great rarity.\r\n\r\nTorre's verses are most accessible in Velázquez' edition (1753). Of\r\nFigueroa there is no recent reprint, though a poor selection is offered\r\nby Rivadeneyra, vol. xlii., which also includes Rufo Gutiérrez' minor\r\nverse: his _Austriada_ is given in vol. xxix., and Ercilla's _Araucana_\r\nin vol. xvii. The _Catálogo razonado biográfico y bibliográfico_ of\r\nthe Portuguese authors who wrote in Spanish is due (1890) to Domingo\r\nGarcía Peres. The Barcelona reprint (1886) of Montemôr is easily found:\r\nProfessor Hugo Albert Rennert's monograph, _The Spanish Pastoral\r\nRomances_ (Baltimore, 1892), is extremely thorough. Zurita is best read\r\nin the _princeps_. A new edition of Mendoza's _Guerra de Granada_ is\r\nurgently called for, and is now being passed through the press by M.\r\nFoulché-Delbosc. Mendoza's burlesque of Silva will be found in Paz y\r\nMelia's _Sales Españolas_ (1890).\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER IX\r\n\r\nHenceforward the task of the bibliographer is lighter; for, though\r\nCervantes, Lope, and later writers are the subjects of an enormous\r\nmass of literature, and are reprinted in editions out of number, it\r\nwill only be necessary to name the most important. The twelve quartos\r\nwhich form the _Obras Completas_ (1863-64) of Cervantes are open to\r\nmuch damaging criticism; but they contain all his writings, except the\r\nconjectural pieces gathered together by D. Adolfo de Castro in his\r\n_Varias obras inéditas de Cervantes_ (1874). For a most exhaustive\r\nbibliography of Cervantes' writings (Barcelona, 1895) we are indebted\r\nto the late D. Leopoldo Rius y Llosellas: a posthumous volume is\r\nto follow, but even in its present incomplete state Rius' book is\r\nworth more than all previous attempts put together. Editions of _Don\r\nQuixote_ abound, and of these Diego Clemencín's (1833-39) deserves\r\nspecial mention for its very learned commentary. A new edition, in\r\ncourse of issue by Mr. David Nutt (1898), presents a text freed from\r\narbitrary emendations which have crept in without authority. Fernández\r\nde Navarrete's biography (1819) is still unequalled. Shelton's early\r\nEnglish version (1612-20) has been reprinted by Mr. Henley in his\r\nseries of _Tudor Translations_ (1896). Of later renderings John\r\nOrmsby's (1885) is much the best, and is prefaced by a very judicious\r\naccount of Cervantes and his work. Duffield (1881) and Mr. H. E. Watts\r\n(1894) have translated _Don Quixote_ in a spirit of enthusiasm. The\r\n_Numancia_ (1885) and _Viaje del Parnaso_ (1883) were both admirably\r\nrendered by the late James Young Gibson. Sr. Menéndez y Pelayo's paper\r\non Avellaneda appeared in _Los Lunes de El Imparcial_ (February 15,\r\n1897).\r\n\r\nThe _Obras_ of Lope, now printing under the editorship of D. Marcelino\r\nMenéndez y Pelayo, will be definitive; but as yet only eight quartos\r\n(including Barrera's _Nueva Biografía_) are available. Lope's _Obras\r\nsueltas_ (1776-79) fill twenty-one volumes; but the best reference\r\nfor readers is to Rivadeneyra, vols. xxiv., xxxv., xxxvii., xli.,\r\nand xlii., where Lope is incompletely but sufficiently exhibited.\r\nM. Arturo Farinelli's _Grillparzer und Lope de Vega_ (Berlin, 1894)\r\nis most excellent. Edmund Dorer's _Die Lope-de-Vega Litteratur in\r\nDeutschland_ (1877) is a praiseworthy compilation. Ormsby's article in\r\nthe _Quarterly Review_ (October 1894) is, as might be expected from\r\nhim, most exact and learned. I am especially indebted to it.\r\n\r\nAs to the picaresque novels, _Guzmán_ is in Rivadeneyra, vol. iii.;\r\nthe _Pícara Justina_ in vol. xxxiii., and _Marcos de Obregón_ in vol.\r\nxviii. A thoughtful and appreciative study on Mateo Alemán has been\r\nprivately printed at Seville (1892) by D. Joaquín Hazañas y la Rua.\r\nAntonio Pérez and Ginés Pérez de Hita are to be read in Rivadeneyra,\r\nvols. xiii. and iii.: Mariana fills vols. xxx. and xxxi., but the two\r\nnoble folios of 1780 are in every way preferable.\r\n\r\n\r\n                               CHAPTER X\r\n\r\nThe early editions of Góngora are named in the text; Rivadeneyra,\r\nvol. xxxii., reprints him in unsatisfactory fashion, but there is\r\nnothing better. Forty-nine inedited pieces by Góngora have been\r\nrecently published by Professor Rennert in the _Revue hispanique_,\r\nvol. iv. Churton's essay on Góngora (1862) is learned, spirited, and\r\ninteresting. Villamediana figures in Rivadeneyra's forty-second volume:\r\nD. Emilio Cotarelo y Mori's minute and judicious study (1886) is\r\nextremely important. Lasso de la Vega's monograph, already cited, on\r\nthe Sevillan school, should be consulted for the poets of that group.\r\nVillegas and the minor poets may be read in Rivadeneyra, vol. xlii.\r\nRioja has been admirably edited by Barrera (1867), who has supplied\r\na most scholarly biography and bibliography: the additional poems\r\nissued in 1872 are more curious than valuable. Quevedo's prose works\r\nwere edited by Aureliano Fernández-Guerra y Orbe with great skill\r\nand accuracy in Rivadeneyra, vols. xxiii. and xlviii.; his verse has\r\nbeen printed in vol. lxix. by Florencio Janer, who was not the man\r\nfor the task. The new and complete edition, issued by the Sociedad de\r\nBibliófilos Andaluces, and edited by D. Marcelino Menéndez y Pelayo,\r\npromises to be admirable, and will include much new matter—for\r\ninstance, a pure text of the _Buscón_. As yet but one volume (1898)\r\nhas been issued to subscribers. M. Ernest Mérimée, the author of an\r\nexcellent monograph on Quevedo (1886), has given us a critical edition\r\nof Castro's _Mocedades del Cid_ (Toulouse, 1890). Vélez de Guevara and\r\nMontalbán are exampled in Rivadeneyra, vol. xlv.: the prose of the\r\nformer is in vol. xviii.\r\n\r\nHartzenbusch's twelve-volume edition of Tirso de Molina (1839-42) is\r\nincomplete, but it is greatly superior to the selection in Rivadeneyra,\r\nvol. v. D. Emilio Cotarelo y Mori's monograph on Tirso (1893)\r\ncontains many new facts, stated with great precision and lucidity.\r\nHartzenbusch's edition of Ruiz de Alarcón in Rivadeneyra, vo. xx., is\r\nthe best and fullest.\r\n\r\nCalderón's editions are numerous, but none are really good. Keil's\r\n(Leipzig, 1827) is the most complete; Hartzenbusch's, which fills\r\nvols. vii., ix., xii., and xiv. of Rivadeneyra, is the easiest to\r\nobtain, and is sufficient for most purposes. Mr. Norman MacColl's\r\n_Select Plays of Calderon_ (1888) deserves special mention for its\r\nexcellent introduction and judicious notes. M. Morel-Fatio's edition\r\nof _El Mágico Prodigioso_ is a model of skill and accuracy. Two small\r\ncollections of Calderón's verse were published at Cádiz, 1845, and\r\nat Madrid, 1881. Archbishop Trench's monograph (1880) and Miss E.\r\nJ. Hasell's study (1879) are deservedly well known. D. Marcelino\r\nMenéndez y Pelayo's lectures, _Calderón y su Teatro_ (1881) are full of\r\nsound, impartial criticism. Friedrich Wilhelm Valentin Schmidt's _Die\r\nSchauspiele Calderon's_ (Elberfeld, 1857) maintains its place by virtue\r\nof its sound and sympathetic criticism. The history of the _autos_ is\r\nfully given by Eduardo González Pedroso in Rivadeneyra, vol. lviii.\r\nEdmund Dorer's _Die Calderon-Litteratur in Deutschland_ (Leipzig, 1881)\r\nis useful and unpretending. D. Antonio Sánchez Moguel's study (1881) of\r\nthe relation between the _Mágico Prodigioso_ and Goethe's _Faust_ is\r\nlearned and ingenious, and D. Antonio Rubió y Lluch's _Sentimiento del\r\nHonor en el Teatro de Calderón_ (Barcelona, 1882) is a very suggestive\r\nessay.\r\n\r\nThe select plays of Rojas Zorrilla and Moreto are contained in\r\nRivadeneyra, vols. xxxix. and liv. There exists no good edition of\r\nGracián: Carl Borinski's study entitled _Baltasar Gracián und die\r\nHoflitteratur in Deutschland_ (Halle, 1894) is a very commendable book,\r\nand M. Arturo Farinelli's criticism in the _Revista crítica_, vol.\r\nii., is not only learned, but is warm in its appreciation of Gracián's\r\nperverse talent.\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER XI\r\n\r\nAn almost complete record of eighteenth-century literature is supplied\r\nby Sr. D. Leopoldo Augusto de Cueto, Marqués de Valmar, in his\r\n_Histórica Crítica de la poesía castellana en el siglo XVIII._ (1893),\r\na revised and augmented edition of the classic preface to Rivadeneyra,\r\nvols. lxi., lxiii., and lxvii. D. Emilio Cotarelo y Mori's invaluable\r\n_Iriarte y su época_ (1897) sheds much light on the literary history of\r\nthe period, and D. Marcelino Menéndez y Pelayo's _Historia de las Ideas\r\nestéticas en España_ (vol. iii. part ii., 1886) should be read as a\r\ncomplement to all other works. Antonio María Alcalá Galiano's _Historia\r\nde la literatura española, francesa, inglesa, é italiano en el siglo\r\nXVIII._ (1845) is acute, but somewhat obsolete. I should recommend as\r\nan honest, useful monograph the life of Sarmiento published under the\r\ntitle of _El Gran Gallego_ (La Coruña, 1895) by D. Antolín López Peláez.\r\n\r\n\r\n                         CHAPTERS XII AND XIII\r\n\r\nThe only summary of the period is Padre Francisco Blanco García's\r\n_Literatura Española en el siglo XIX._ (1891): it is extremely\r\nuncritical, and is marred by violent personal prejudices intemperately\r\nexpressed. But it has the merit of existing, and embodies useful\r\ninformation in the way of facts. Gustave Hubbard's _Histoire de la\r\nlittérature contemporaine en Espagne_ (1876) and Boris de Tannenberg's\r\n_La Poésie castellane contemporaine_ (1892) are pleasant but slight.\r\nPedro de Novo y Colsón's _Autores dramáticos contemporaneos y joyas del\r\nteatro español del siglo XIX._ (1881-85), with a preface by Antonio\r\nCánovas del Castillo, is conscientiously put together, and will be\r\nfound very serviceable.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[32] Unless otherwise stated, it is to be understood that, of the books\r\nnamed in this list, the Spanish are issued at Madrid, the English at\r\nLondon, and the French at Paris.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                                 INDEX\r\n\r\n\r\n  Abarbanel, Judas, 131, 219\r\n\r\n  Abraham ben David, 19\r\n\r\n  Acuña, Fernando de, 149-150\r\n\r\n  Adenet le Roi, 41\r\n\r\n  _Alabanza de Mahoma_, 20\r\n\r\n  Alarcón, Pedro Antonio de, 381-382\r\n\r\n  Alas, Leopoldo, 391-392\r\n\r\n  Alba, Bartolomé, 257\r\n\r\n  Alcalá, Alfonso de, 130\r\n\r\n  Alcalá y Herrera, Alonso de, 338\r\n\r\n  Alcázar, Baltasar de, 176\r\n\r\n  Alemán, Mateo, 264-267\r\n\r\n  _Alexander, Letters of_, 63, 65\r\n\r\n  _Alexandre, Libro de_, 62, 63, 65\r\n\r\n  Alfonso II. of Aragón, 28, 29\r\n\r\n  Alfonso the Learned, 28, 30, 38, 60, 63-72\r\n\r\n  Alfonso XI., 85\r\n\r\n  _Aljamía_, 19-20\r\n\r\n  Altamira y Crevea, Rafael, 398\r\n\r\n  _Altobiskarko Cantua_, 2\r\n\r\n  Al-Tufail, 12\r\n\r\n  Álvarez de Ayllón, Pero, 165\r\n\r\n  Álvarez de Cienfuegos, Nicasio, 359\r\n\r\n  Álvarez de Toledo, Gabriel, 346\r\n\r\n  Álvarez de Villasandino, Alfonso, 26, 31\r\n\r\n  Álvarez Gato, Juan, 112\r\n\r\n  _Amadís de Gaula_, 91, 97, 106, 123-124\r\n\r\n  _Amadís de Grecia_, 106, 157\r\n\r\n  Amador de los Ríos, José, 34, 43, 107\r\n\r\n  Amalteo, Giovanni Battista, 186\r\n\r\n  _Anales Toledanos_, 62\r\n\r\n  Andújar, Juan de, 109\r\n\r\n  Ángeles, Juan de los, 202\r\n\r\n  Ángulo y Pulgar, Martín de, 291\r\n\r\n  _Anséïs de Carthage_, 41\r\n\r\n  Antonio, Nicolás, 343\r\n\r\n  _Apolonio, Libro de_, 20, 30, 38, 53-54\r\n\r\n  Arab influence, 14-19\r\n\r\n  Arévalo, Faustino, 11\r\n\r\n  Argensola. _See_ Leonardo de Argensola\r\n\r\n  Argote, Juan de, 280\r\n\r\n  Argote y Góngora, Luis, 143, 233, 250, 270, 276, 279-294\r\n\r\n  Arguijo, Juan de, 298\r\n\r\n  Arias Montano, Benito, 181, 202-203, 272\r\n\r\n  Artieda. _See_ Rey de Artieda\r\n\r\n  Asenjo Barbieri, Francisco, 19, 131, 250\r\n\r\n  Avellaneda. _See_ Fernández de Avellaneda\r\n\r\n  Avellaneda. _See_ Gómez de Avellaneda\r\n\r\n  Avempace, 12\r\n\r\n  Avendaño, Francisco de, 170\r\n\r\n  Averroes, 12\r\n\r\n  Avicebron, 11, 17, 18\r\n\r\n  Ávila, Juan de, 161\r\n\r\n  Ávila y Zúñiga, Luis, 156\r\n\r\n  _Avilés, Fuero de_, 24\r\n\r\n  Axular, Pedro de, 3\r\n\r\n  Ayala. _See_ López de Ayala\r\n\r\n  Azémar, Guilhem, 36\r\n\r\n\r\n  Baena, Juan Alfonso de, 95, 96\r\n\r\n  Baist, Professor, 82\r\n\r\n  Balbus, 5\r\n\r\n  Balmes y Uspia, Jaime, 382\r\n\r\n  Bances Candamo, Francisco Antonio, 335\r\n\r\n  Barahona de Soto, Luis, 189, 270\r\n\r\n  Barcelo, Francisco, 118\r\n\r\n  _Barlaam and Josaphat, Legend of_, 83, 96\r\n\r\n  Barrera y Leirado, Cayetano Alberto de la, 242, 244\r\n\r\n  Barrientos, Lope de, 95\r\n\r\n  Basque influence, 3-4\r\n\r\n  Baudouin, Jean, 233\r\n\r\n  Bavia, Luis de, 286\r\n\r\n  Bechada, Grégoire de, 72\r\n\r\n  Bécquer, Gustavo Adolfo, 377-378\r\n\r\n  Bédier, M.
