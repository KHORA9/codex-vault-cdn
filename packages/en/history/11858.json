He was a man of\r\nfifty-six, evidently tall and of strong figure, but with shoulders a\r\ntrifle stooped, enormously large hands and feet, sparse grayish-chestnut\r\nhair, a countenance somewhat marred by lines of care and marks of\r\nsmallpox, withal benevolent and honest-looking--the kind of man to whom\r\none could intrust the inheritance of a child with the certainty that it\r\nwould be carefully administered and scrupulously accounted for to the\r\nvery last sixpence.\r\n\r\nThe letter was addressed to an Englishman, by name Arthur Young, the\r\nforemost scientific farmer of his day, editor of the _Annals of\r\nAgriculture_, author of many books, of which the best remembered is his\r\n_Travels in France_ on the eve of the French Revolution, which is still\r\nread by every student of that stirring era.\r\n\r\n\"The more I am acquainted with agricultural affairs,\" such were the\r\nwords that flowed from the writer's pen, \"the better I am pleased with\r\nthem; insomuch, that I can no where find so great satisfaction as in\r\nthose innocent and useful pursuits. In indulging these feelings I am led\r\nto reflect how much more delightful to an undebauched mind is the task\r\nof making improvements on the earth than all the vain glory which can be\r\nacquired from ravaging it, by the most uninterrupted career of\r\nconquests.\"\r\n\r\nThus wrote George Washington in the fulness of years, honors and\r\nexperience. Surely in this age of crimson mists we can echo his\r\ncorrespondent that it was a \"noble sentiment, which does honor to the\r\nheart of this truly great man.\" Happy America to have had such a\r\nphilosopher as a father!\r\n\r\n\"I think with you that the life of a husbandman is the most delectable,\"\r\nhe wrote on another occasion to the same friend. \"It is honorable, it is\r\namusing, and, with judicious management, it is profitable. To see\r\nplants rise from the earth and flourish by the superior skill and bounty\r\nof the laborer fills a contemplative mind with ideas which are more easy\r\nto be conceived than expressed.\"\r\n\r\nThe earliest Washington arms had blazoned upon it \"3 Cinque foiles,\"\r\nwhich was the herald's way of saying that the bearer owned land and was\r\na farmer. When Washington made a book-plate he added to the old design\r\nspears of wheat to indicate what he once called \"the most favorite\r\namusement of my life.\" Evidently he had no fear of being-called a\r\n\"clodhopper\" or a \"hayseed!\"\r\n\r\nNor was his enthusiasm for agriculture the evanescent enthusiasm of the\r\nman who in middle age buys a farm as a plaything and tries for the first\r\ntime the costly experiment of cultivating the soil. He was born on a\r\nplantation, was brought up in the country and until manhood he had never\r\neven seen a town of five thousand people. First he was a surveyor, and\r\nso careful and painstaking was he that his work still stands the test.\r\nLater he became a soldier, and there is evidence to show that at first\r\nhe enjoyed the life and for a time had military ambitions. When\r\nBraddock's expedition was preparing he chafed at the prospect of\r\ninaction and welcomed the offer to join the general's staff, but the\r\nbitter experiences of the next few years, when he had charge of the\r\nherculean task of protecting the settlers upon the \"cold and Barren\r\nFrontiers ... from the cruel Incursions of a crafty Savage Enemy,\"\r\ndestroyed his illusions about war. After the capture of Fort Duquesne\r\nhad freed Virginia from danger he resigned his commission, married and\r\nmade a home. Soon after he wrote to an English kinsman who had invited\r\nhim to visit London: \"I am now I believe fixed at this seat with an\r\nagreeable Consort for Life. And hope to find more happiness in\r\nretirement than I ever experienced amidst a wide bustling world.\"\r\n\r\nThereafter he quitted the quiet life always with reluctance. Amid long\r\nand trying years he constantly looked forward to the day when he could\r\nlay down his burden and retire to the peace and freedom of Mount Vernon,\r\nthere to take up again the task of farming. As Commander-in-Chief of the\r\nArmies of the Revolution and as first President of the Republic he gave\r\nthe best that was in him--and it was always good enough--but more from a\r\nsense of duty than because of any real enthusiasm for the rôle of\r\neither soldier or statesman. We can well believe that it was with\r\nheartfelt satisfaction that soon after independence was at last assured\r\nhe wrote to his old comrade-in-arms the Marquis de Chastellux: \"I am at\r\nlength become a private citizen on the banks of the Potomac, where under\r\nmy own vine and fig-tree free from the bustle of a camp and the\r\nintrigues of a court, I shall view the busy world with calm\r\nindifference, and with serenity of mind, which the soldier in pursuit of\r\nglory, and the statesman of a name, have not leisure to enjoy.\"\r\n\r\nYears before as a boy he had copied into a wonderful copy-book that is\r\nstill preserved in the Library of Congress some verses that set forth\r\npretty accurately his ideal of life--an ideal influenced, may we not\r\nbelieve, in those impressionable years by these very lines. These are\r\nthe verses--one can not call them poetry--just as I copied them after\r\nthe clear boyish hand from the time-yellowed page:\r\n\r\n     TRUE HAPPINESS\r\n\r\n     These are the things, which once possess'd\r\n     Will make a life that's truly bless'd\r\n     A good Estate on healthy Soil,\r\n     Not Got by Vice nor yet by toil;\r\n     Round a warm Fire, a pleasant Joke,\r\n     With Chimney ever free from Smoke:\r\n     A strength entire, a Sparkling Bowl,\r\n     A quiet Wife, a quiet Soul,\r\n     A Mind, as well as body, whole\r\n     Prudent Simplicity, constant Friend,\r\n     A Diet which no art Commends;\r\n     A Merry Night without much Drinking\r\n     A happy Thought without much Thinking;\r\n     Each Night by Quiet Sleep made Short\r\n     A Will to be but what thou art:\r\n     Possess'd of these, all else defy\r\n     And neither wish nor fear to Die\r\n       These are things, which once Possess'd\r\n       Will make a life that's truly bless'd.\r\n\r\nGeorge Washington did not affect the rôle of a Cincinnatus; he took it\r\nin all sincerity and simpleness of heart because he loved it.\r\n\r\nNor was he the type of farmer--of whom we have too many--content to\r\nvegetate like a lower organism, making scarcely more mental effort than\r\none of his own potatoes, parsnips or pumpkins. As the pages that follow\r\nwill reveal, he was one of the first American experimental\r\nagriculturists, always alert for better methods, willing to take any\r\namount of pains to find the best fertilizer, the best way to avoid\r\nplant diseases, the best methods of cultivation, and he once declared\r\nthat he had little patience with those content to tread the ruts their\r\nfathers trod. If he were alive to-day, we may be sure that he would be\r\nan active worker in farmers' institutes, an eager visitor to\r\nagricultural colleges, a reader of scientific reports and an\r\nenthusiastic promoter of anything tending to better American farming and\r\nfarm life.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II\r\n\r\n\r\nBUILDING AN ESTATE\r\n\r\nAugustine Washington was a planter who owned thousands of acres of land,\r\nmost of it unimproved, besides an interest in some small iron works, but\r\nhe had been twice married and at his death left two broods of children\r\nto be provided for. George, a younger son--which implied a great deal in\r\nthose days of entail and primogeniture--received the farm on the\r\nRappahannock on which his father lived, amounting to two hundred and\r\neighty acres, a share of the land lying on Deep Run, three lots in\r\nFrederick, a few negro slaves and a quarter of the residuary estate. He\r\nwas also given a reversionary interest in Mount Vernon, bequeathed to\r\nhis half-brother Lawrence. The total value of his inheritance was small,\r\nand, as Virginia landed fortunes went, he was left poorly provided for.\r\n\r\nMuch of Washington's youth was spent with Lawrence at Mount Vernon, and\r\nas an aside it may be remarked here that the main moulding influence in\r\nhis life was probably cast by this high-minded brother, who was a\r\nsoldier and man of the world. By the time he was sixteen the boy was on\r\nthe frontier helping Lord Thomas Fairfax to survey the princely domain\r\nthat belonged to his lordship, and received in payment therefor\r\nsometimes as much as a doubloon a day. In 1748 he patented five hundred\r\nfifty acres of wild land in Frederick County, \"My Bullskin Plantation\"\r\nhe usually called it, payment being made by surveying. In 1750 he had\r\nfunds sufficient to buy four hundred fifty-six acres of land of one\r\nJames McCracken, paying therefor one hundred twelve pounds. Two years\r\nlater for one hundred fifteen pounds he bought five hundred fifty-two\r\nacres on the south fork of Bullskin Creek from Captain George Johnston.\r\nIn 1757 he acquired from a certain Darrell five hundred acres on Dogue\r\nRun near Mount Vernon, paying three hundred fifty pounds.\r\n\r\nIt is evident, therefore, that very early he acquired the \"land hunger\"\r\nto which most of the Virginians of his day were subject, as a heritage\r\nfrom their English ancestry. In the England of that day, in fact, no\r\none except a churchman could hope to attain much of a position in the\r\nworld unless he was the owner of land, and until the passage of the\r\ngreat Reform Bill in 1832 he could not even vote unless he held land\r\nworth forty shillings a year. In Virginia likewise it was the landholder\r\nwho enjoyed distinction and consideration, who was sent to the House of\r\nBurgesses and was bowed and scraped to as his coach bumped along over\r\nthe miserable roads. The movement to cities did not begin until after\r\nthe Industrial Revolution, and people still held the healthy notion that\r\nthe country was the proper place in which to live a normal human\r\nexistence.\r\n\r\nIn 1752 Lawrence Washington died. As already stated, he was the\r\nproprietor by inheritance of Mount Vernon, then an estate of two\r\nthousand five hundred acres which had been in the Washington family\r\nsince 1674, being a grant from Lord Culpeper. Lawrence had fought\r\nagainst the Spaniards in the conflict sometimes known as the war of\r\nJenkins's Ear, and in the disastrous siege of Cartagena had served under\r\nAdmiral Vernon, after whom he later named his estate. He married Anne\r\nFairfax, daughter of Sir William Fairfax, and for her built on his\r\nestate a new residence, containing eight rooms, four to each floor, with\r\na large chimney at each end.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Mount Vernon, Showing Kitchen to the Left and Covered\r\nWay Leading to It]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _From a painting by T.P. Rossiter and L.R. Mignot_ The\r\nWashington Family]  Lawrence Washington was the father of four\r\nchildren, but only an infant daughter, Sarah, survived him, and she died\r\nsoon after him. By the terms of his father's and Lawrence's wills George\r\nWashington, after the death of this child, became the ultimate inheritor\r\nof the Mount Vernon estate, but, contrary to the common idea, Anne\r\nFairfax Washington, who soon married George Lee, retained a life\r\ninterest. On December 17, 1754, however, the Lees executed a deed\r\ngranting said life interest to George Washington in consideration of an\r\nannual payment during Anne Lee's lifetime of fifteen thousand pounds of\r\ntobacco or the equivalent in current money[1]. Mrs. Lee died in 1761 and\r\nthereafter Washington owned the estate absolutely. That it was by no\r\nmeans so valuable at that time as its size would indicate is shown by\r\nthe smallness of the, rent he paid, never more than four hundred\r\nsixty-five dollars a year. Many eighty-acre farms rent for that much\r\nto-day and even for more.\r\n\r\n[1] From entries in Washington's account book we know that this\r\nequivalent in 1755 was £93.15; during each of the next four years it was\r\n£87.10, and for 1760 it was £81.5.\r\n\r\nUp to 1759 Washington was so constantly engaged in fighting the French\r\nand Indians that he had little time and opportunity to look after his\r\nprivate affairs and in consequence they suffered. In 1757 he wrote from\r\nthe Shenandoah Valley to an English agent that he should have some\r\ntobacco to sell, but could not say whether he did have or not. His pay\r\nhardly sufficed for his personal expenses and on the disastrous Fort\r\nNecessity and Braddock campaigns he lost his horses and baggage. Owing\r\nto his absence from home, his affairs fell into great disorder from\r\nwhich they were extricated by a fortunate stroke.\r\n\r\nThis stroke consisted in his marriage to Martha Custis, relict of the\r\nwealthy Daniel Parke Custis. The story of his wooing the young widow has\r\nbeen often told with many variations and fanciful embellishments, but of\r\na few facts we are certain. From a worldly point of view Mrs. Custis was\r\nthe most desirable woman in all Virginia, and the young officer, though\r\nnot as yet a victor in many battles, had fought gallantly, possessed the\r\nconfidence of the Colony and formed a shining exception to most of the\r\ntidewater aristocracy who continued to hunt the fox and guzzle Madeira\r\nwhile a cruel foe was harrying the western border. Matters moved\r\nforward with the rapidity traditional in similar cases and in about\r\nthree weeks and before the Colonel left to join Forbes in the final\r\nexpedition against Fort Duquesne the little widow had been wooed and\r\nwon. After his return from that expedition Washington resigned his\r\ncommission and on the 6th of January, 1759, they were married at her\r\n\"White House\" on York River and spent their honeymoon at her \"Six\r\nChimney House\" in Williamsburg.\r\n\r\nThe young groom and farmer--as he would now have styled himself--was at\r\nthis time not quite twenty-seven years old, six feet two inches high,\r\nstraight as an Indian and weighed about one hundred and seventy-five\r\npounds. His bones and joints were large, as were his hands and feet. He\r\nwas wide-shouldered but somewhat flat-chested, neat-waisted but broad\r\nacross the hips, with long arms and legs. His skin was rather pale and\r\ncolorless and easily burned by the sun, and his hair, a chestnut brown,\r\nhe usually wore in a queue. His mouth was large and generally firmly\r\nclosed and the teeth were already somewhat defective. His countenance as\r\na whole was pleasing, benevolent and commanding, and in conversation he\r\nlooked one full in the face and was deliberate, deferential and\r\nengaging. His voice was agreeable rather than strong. His demeanor at\r\nall times was composed and dignified, his movements and gestures\r\ngraceful, his walk majestic and he was a superb horseman[2].\r\n\r\n[2] Adapted from a description written by his comrade-in-arms, George\r\nMercer.\r\n\r\nThe bride brought her husband a \"little progeny\" consisting of two\r\ninteresting stepchildren; also property worth about a hundred thousand\r\ndollars, including many negro slaves, money on bond and stock in the\r\nBank of England. Soon we find him sending certificates of the marriage\r\nto the English agents of the Custis estate and announcing to them that\r\nthe management of the whole would be in his hands.\r\n\r\nThe dower negroes were kept separate from those owned by himself, but\r\notherwise he seems to have made little distinction between his own and\r\nMrs. Washington's property, which was now, in fact, by Virginia law his\r\nown. When Martha wanted money she applied to him for it. Now and then in\r\nhis cash memorandum books we come upon such entries as, \"By Cash to Mrs.\r\nWashington for Pocket Money £4.\" As a rule, if there were any purchases\r\nto be made, she let George do it and, if we may judge from the long\r\nlist of tabby colored velvet gowns, silk hose, satin shoes, \"Fashionable\r\nSummer Cloaks & Hatts,\" and similar articles ordered from the English\r\nagents she had no reason to complain that her husband was niggardly or a\r\npoor provider. If her \"Old Man\"--for she sometimes called him\r\nthat--failed in anything she desired, tradition says that the little\r\nlady was in the habit of taking hold of a button of his coat and hanging\r\non until he had promised to comply.\r\n\r\nHe managed the property of the two children with great care and\r\nfidelity, keeping a scrupulous account in a \"marble colour'd folio Book\"\r\nof every penny received or expended in their behalf and making a yearly\r\nreport to the general court of his stewardship. How minute this account\r\nwas is indicated by an entry in his cash memorandum book for August 21,\r\n1772: \"Charge Miss Custis with a hair Pin mended by C. Turner\" one\r\nshilling. Her death (of \"Fitts\") in 1773 added about ten thousand pounds\r\nto Mrs. Washington's property, which meant to his own.\r\n\r\nThere can be no question that the fortune he acquired by the Custis\r\nalliance proved of great advantage to him in his future career, for it\r\nhelped to make him independent as regards money considerations. He\r\nmight never have become the Father of His Country without it. Some of\r\nhis contemporaries, including jealous-hearted John Adams, seem to have\r\nrealized this, and tradition says that old David Burnes, the crusty\r\nScotsman who owned part of the land on which the Federal City was laid\r\nout, once ventured to growl to the President: \"Now what would ye ha'\r\nbeen had ye not married the widow Custis?\" But this was a narrow view of\r\nthe matter, for Washington was known throughout the Colonies before he\r\nmarried the Custis pounds sterling and was a man of too much natural\r\nability not to have made a mark in later life, though possibly not so\r\nhigh a one. Besides, as will be explained in detail later, much of the\r\nCustis money was lost during the Revolution as a result of the\r\ndepreciation in the currency.\r\n\r\nFollowing his marriage Washington added largely to his estate, both in\r\nthe neighborhood of Mount Vernon and elsewhere. In 1759 he bought of his\r\nfriend Bryan Fairfax two hundred and seventy-five acres on Difficult\r\nRun, and about the same time from his neighbor, the celebrated George\r\nMason of Gunston Hall, he acquired one hundred acres next that already\r\nbought of Darrell. Negotiations entered into with a certain Clifton for\r\nthe purchase of a tract of one thousand eight hundred six acres called\r\nBrents was productive of much annoyance. Clifton agreed in February,\r\n1760, to sell the ground for one thousand one hundred fifty pounds, but\r\nlater, \"under pretence of his wife not consenting to acknowledge her\r\nright of dower wanted to disengage himself ... and by his shuffling\r\nbehavior convinced me of his being the trifling body represented.\"\r\nWashington heard presently that Clifton had sold the land to another\r\nman for one thousand two hundred pounds, which fully \"unravelled his\r\nconduct ... and convinced me that he was nothing less than a thorough\r\npaced rascal.\" Ultimately Washington acquired Brents, but had to pay\r\none thousand two hundred ten pounds for it.\r\n\r\nDuring the next few years he acquired other tracts, notably the Posey\r\nplantation just below Mount Vernon and later often called by him the\r\nFerry Farm. With it he acquired a ferry to the Maryland shore and a\r\nfishery, both of which industries he continued.\r\n\r\nBy 1771 he paid quit rents upon an estate of five thousand five hundred\r\neighteen acres in Fairfax County; on two thousand four hundred\r\nninety-eight acres in Frederick County; on one thousand two hundred\r\nfifty acres in King George; on two hundred forty in Hampshire; on two\r\nhundred seventy-five in Loudoun; on two thousand six hundred eighty-two\r\nin Loudoun Faquier--in all, twelve thousand four hundred sixty-three\r\nacres. The quit rent was two shillings and sixpence per hundred acres\r\nand amounted to £15.11.7.\r\n\r\nIn addition to these lands in the settled parts of Virginia he also had\r\nclaims to vast tracts in the unsettled West. For services in the French\r\nand Indian War he was given twenty thousand acres of wild land beyond\r\nthe mountains--a cheap mode of reward, for the Ohio region was to all\r\nintents and purposes more remote than Yukon is to-day. Many of his\r\nfellow soldiers held their grants so lightly that he was able to buy\r\ntheir claims for almost a song. The feeling that such grants were\r\ncomparatively worthless was increased by the fact that to become\r\neffective they must be located and surveyed, while doubt existed as to\r\nwhether they would be respected owing to conflicting claims,\r\njurisdictions and proclamations.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: The Porter's Lodge]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Driveway from the Lodge Gate]\r\n\r\nWashington, however, had seen the land and knew it was good and he\r\nhad prophetic faith in the future of the West. He employed his old\r\ncomrade Captain William Crawford to locate and survey likely tracts not\r\nonly in what is now West Virginia and western Pennsylvania, but beyond\r\nthe Ohio River. Settlement in the latter region had been forbidden by\r\nthe King's proclamation of 1763, but Washington thought that this was\r\nmerely a temporary measure designed to quiet the Indians and was anxious\r\nto have picked out in advance \"some of the most valuable land in the\r\nKing's part.\" In other words he desired Crawford to act the part of a\r\n\"Sooner,\" in the language of more than a century later.\r\n\r\nIn this period a number of companies were scrambling for western lands,\r\nand Washington, at one time or another, had an interest in what was\r\nknown as the Walpole Grant, the Mississippi Company, the Military\r\nCompany of Adventurers and the Dismal Swamp Company. This last company,\r\nhowever, was interested in redeeming lands about Dismal Swamp in eastern\r\nVirginia and it was the only one that succeeded. In 1799 he estimated\r\nthe value of his share in that company at twenty thousand dollars.\r\n\r\nWashington took the lead in securing the rights of his old soldiers in\r\nthe French War, advancing money to pay expenses in behalf of the common\r\ncause and using his influence in the proper quarters. In August, 1770,\r\nhe met many of his former officers at Captain Weedon's in\r\nFredericksburg, and after they had dined and had talked over old times,\r\nthey discussed the subject of their claims until sunset, and it was\r\ndecided that Washington should personally make a long and dangerous trip\r\nto the western region.\r\n\r\nIn October he set out with his old friend Doctor James Craik and three\r\nservants, including the ubiquitous Billy Lee, and on the way increased\r\nthe party. They followed the old Braddock Road to Pittsburgh, then a\r\nvillage of about twenty log cabins, visiting en route some tracts of\r\nland that Crawford had selected. At Pittsburgh they obtained a large\r\ndugout, and with Crawford, two Indians and several borderers, floated\r\ndown the Ohio, picking out and marking rich bottom lands and having\r\ngreat sport hunting and fishing.\r\n\r\nThe region in which they traveled was then little known and was\r\nunsettled by white men. Daniel Boone had made his first hunting trip\r\ninto \"the dark and bloody ground of Kaintuckee\" only the year before,\r\nand scattered along the banks of the Ohio stood the wigwam villages of\r\nthe aboriginal lords of the land. At one such village Washington met a\r\nchief who had accompanied him on his memorable winter journey in 1753 to\r\nwarn out the French, and elsewhere talked with Indians who had shot at\r\nhim in the battle of the Monongahela and now expressed a belief that he\r\nmust be invulnerable. At the Mingo Town they saw a war party of three\r\nscore painted Iroquois on their way to fight the far distant Catawbas.\r\nBetween the Indians and the white men peace nominally reigned, but\r\nrumors were flying of impending uprisings, and the Red Man's smouldering\r\nhate was soon to burst into the flame known as Lord Dunmore's War. Once\r\nthe party was alarmed by a report that the Indians had killed two white\r\nmen, but they breathed easier on learning that the sole basis of the\r\nstory was that a trader had tried to swim his horse across the Ohio and\r\nhad been drowned. In spite of uncertainties, the voyagers continued to\r\nthe Great Kanawha and paddled about fourteen miles up that stream. Near\r\nits mouth Washington located two large tracts for himself and military\r\ncomrades and after interesting hunting experiences and inspecting some\r\nenormous sycamores--concerning which matters more hereafter--the party\r\nturned back, and Washington reached home after an absence of nine weeks.\r\n\r\nTwo of Washington's western tracts are of special interest. One had been\r\nselected by Crawford in 1767 and was \"a fine piece of land on a stream\r\ncalled Chartiers Creek\" in the present Washington County, southwest of\r\nPittsburgh. Crawford surveyed the tract and marked it by blazed trees,\r\nbuilt four cabins and cleared a patch of ground, as an improvement,\r\nabout each. Later Washington, casting round for some one from whom to\r\nobtain a military title with which to cover the tract, bought out the\r\nclaim of his financially embarrassed old neighbor Captain John Posey to\r\nthree thousand acres, paying £11.11.3, or about two cents per acre.\r\nCrawford, now a deputy surveyor of the region, soon after resurveyed two\r\nthousand eight hundred thirteen acres and forwarded the \"return\" to\r\nWashington, with the result that in 1774 Governor Dunmore of Virginia\r\ngranted a patent for the land.\r\n\r\nIn the meantime, however, six squatters built a cabin upon the tract and\r\ncleared two or three acres, but Crawford paid them five pounds for their\r\nimprovements and induced them to move on. To keep off other interlopers\r\nhe placed a man on the land, but in 1773 a party of rambunctious\r\nScotch-Irishmen appeared on the scene, drove the keeper away, built a\r\ncabin so close in front of his door that he could not get back in, and\r\ncontinued to hold the land until after the Revolution.\r\n\r\nBy that time Crawford himself was dead--having suffered the most\r\nterrible of all deaths--that of an Indian captive burnt at the stake.\r\n\r\nThe other tract whose history it is worth our while to follow consisted\r\nof twelve hundred acres on the Youghiogheny River, likewise not far from\r\nPittsburgh. It bore seams of coal, which Washington examined in 1770 and\r\nthought \"to be of the very best kind, burning freely and abundance of\r\nit.\" In the spring of 1773 he sent out a certain Gilbert Simpson, with\r\nwhom he had formed a sort of partnership, to look after this land, and\r\neach furnished some laborers, Washington a \"fellow\" and a \"wench.\"\r\nSimpson managed to clear some ground and get in six acres of corn, but\r\nhis wife disliked life on the borderland and made him so uncomfortable\r\nwith her complaints that he decided to throw up the venture. However, he\r\nchanged his mind, and after a trip back East returned and, on a site\r\nnoticed by the owner on his visit, built a grist mill on a small stream\r\nnow called Washington's Run that empties into the Youghiogheny. This was\r\none of the first mills erected west of the Alleghany Mountains and is\r\nstill standing, though more or less rebuilt. The millstones were dug out\r\nof quarries in the neighborhood and the work of building the mill was\r\ndone amid considerable danger from the Indians, who had begun what is\r\nknown as Dunmore's War. Simpson's cabin and the slave quarters stood\r\nnear what is now Plant No. 2 of the Washington Coal and Coke Company.\r\nThe tract of land contains valuable seams of coal and with some\r\ncontiguous territory is valued at upward of twenty million dollars.\r\n\r\nWashington had large ideas for the development of these western lands.\r\nAt one time he considered attempting to import Palatine Germans to\r\nsettle there, but after careful investigation decided that the plan was\r\nimpracticable. In 1774 he bought four men convicts, four indented\r\nservants, and a man and his wife for four years and sent them and some\r\ncarpenters out to help Simpson build the mill and otherwise improve the\r\nlands. Next year he sent out another party, but Indian troubles and\r\nlater the Revolution united with the natural difficulties of the\r\ncountry to put a stop to progress. Some of the servants were sold and\r\nothers ran away, but Simpson stayed on in charge, though without making\r\nany financial settlement with his patron till 1784.\r\n\r\nAt the close of the Revolution Washington wrote to President John\r\nWitherspoon of Princeton College that he had in the western country\r\npatents under signature of Lord Dunmore \"for about 30,000 acres, and\r\nsurveys for about 10,000 more, patents for which were suspended by the\r\ndisputes with Great Britain, which soon followed the return of the\r\nwarrants to the land office. Ten thousand acres of the above thirty lie\r\nupon the Ohio; the rest on the Great Kenhawa, a river nearly as large,\r\nand quite as easy in its navigation, as the former, The whole of it is\r\nrich bottom land, beautifully situated on these rivers, and abounding\r\nplenteously in fish, wild-fowl, and game of all kinds.\"\r\n\r\nHe could have obtained vast land grants for his Revolutionary services,\r\nbut he stuck by his announced intention of receiving only compensation\r\nfor his expenses. He continued, however, to be greatly interested in the\r\nwestern country and was one of the first Americans to foresee the\r\nimportance of that region to the young Republic, predicting that it\r\nwould become populated more rapidly than any one could believe and\r\nfaster than any similar region ever had been settled. He was extremely\r\nanxious to develop better methods of communication with the West and in\r\n1783 made a trip up the Mohawk River to the famous Oneida or Great\r\nCarrying Place to view the possibilities of waterway development in that\r\nregion--the future course of the Erie Canal. Soon after he wrote to his\r\nfriend the Chevalier de Chastellux: \"I could not help taking a more\r\nextensive view of the vast inland navigation of these United States and\r\ncould not but be struck by the immense extent and importance of it, and\r\nof the goodness of that Providence which has dealt its favors to us with\r\nso profuse a hand. Would to God we may have wisdom enough to improve\r\nthem. I shall not rest contented till I have explored the Western\r\nCountry, and traversed those lines or great part of them, which have\r\ngiven bounds to a new empire.\"\r\n\r\nIn partnership with George Clinton he bought, in 1784, a tract of six\r\nthousand acres on the Mohawk, paying for his share, including interest,\r\none thousand eight hundred seventy-five pounds. In 1793 he sold\r\ntwo-thirds of his half for three thousand four hundred pounds and in his\r\nwill valued the thousand acres that remained at six thousand dollars.\r\nThis was a speculation pure and simple, as he was never in the region in\r\nwhich the land lay but once.\r\n\r\nOn December 23, 1783, in an ever memorable scene, Washington resigned\r\nhis commission as Commander of the Continental Army and rode off from\r\nAnnapolis to Mount Vernon to keep Christmas there for the first time\r\nsince 1774. The next eight months he was busily engaged in making\r\nrepairs and improvements about his home estate, but on September first,\r\nhaving two days before said good-by to Lafayette, who had been visiting\r\nhim, he set off on horseback to inspect his western lands and to obtain\r\ninformation requisite to a scheme he had for improving the \"Inland\r\nNavigation of the Potomac\" and connecting its head waters by canal with\r\nthose of the Ohio. The first object was rendered imperative by the\r\nsettlement of squatters on part of his richest land, some of which was\r\neven being offered for sale by unscrupulous land agents.\r\n\r\nWith him went again his old friend Doctor Craik. Their equipage\r\nconsisted of three servants and six horses, three of which last carried\r\nthe baggage, including a marquee, some camp utensils, a few medicines,\r\n\"hooks and lines,\" Madeira, port wine and cherry bounce. Stopping at\r\nnight and for meals at taverns or the homes of relatives or friends,\r\nthey passed up the picturesque Potomac Valley, meeting many friends\r\nalong the way, among them the celebrated General Daniel Morgan, with\r\nwhom Washington talked over the waterways project. At \"Happy Retreat,\"\r\nthe home of Charles Washington in the fertile Shenandoah Valley, beyond\r\nthe Blue Ridge, Washington met and transacted business with tenants who\r\nlived on his lands in that region. On September fifth he reached Bath,\r\nthe present Berkeley Springs, where he owned two thousand acres of land\r\nand two lots. Here fifteen years before he had come with his family in\r\nthe hope that the water would benefit poor \"Patey\" Custis, and here he\r\nmet \"the ingenious Mr. Rumney\" who showed him the model of a boat to be\r\npropelled by steam.\r\n\r\nAt Bath the party was joined by Doctor Craik's son William and by the\r\nGeneral's nephew, Bushrod Washington. Twelve miles to the west\r\nWashington turned aside from the main party to visit a tract of two\r\nhundred forty acres that he owned on the Virginia side of the Potomac.\r\nHe found it \"exceedingly Rich, & must be very valuable--the lower end of\r\nthe Land is rich white oak in places springey ... the upper part is ...\r\ncovered with Walnut of considerable size many of them.\" He \"got a snack\"\r\nat the home of a Mr. McCracken and left with that gentleman the terms\r\nupon which he would let the land, then rode onward and rejoined\r\nthe others.\r\n\r\nThe cavalcade passed on to Fort Cumberland. There Washington left the\r\nmain party to follow with the baggage and hurried on ahead along\r\nBraddock's old road in order to fill an appointment to be at Gilbert\r\nSimpson's by the fifteenth. Passing through the dark tangle of Laurel\r\nknown as the Shades of Death, he came on September twelfth to the\r\nopening among the mountains--the Great Meadows--where in 1754 in his\r\nrude little fort of logs, aptly named Fort Necessity, he had fought the\r\nFrench and had been conquered by them. He owned the spot now, for in\r\n1770 Crawford had bought it for him for \"30 Pistols[3],\" Thirty years\r\nbefore, as an enthusiastic youth, he had called it a \"charming field for\r\nan encounter\"; now he spoke of it as \"capable of being turned to great\r\nadvantage ... a very good stand for a Tavern--much Hay may be cut here\r\nWhen the ground is laid down in grass & the upland, East of the Meadow,\r\nis good for grain.\"\r\n\r\n[3] Doubtless he meant pistoles, coins, not weapons.\r\n\r\nNot a word about the spot's old associations!\r\n\r\nThe same day he pushed on through the mountains, meeting \"numbers of\r\nPersons & Pack horses going in with Ginseng; & for Salt & other articles\r\nat the Markets below,\" and near nightfall reached on the Youghiogheny\r\nRiver the tract on which Gilbert Simpson, his agent, lived. He found the\r\nland poorer than he had expected and the buildings that had been erected\r\nindifferent, while the mill was in such bad condition that \"little Rent,\r\nor good is to be expected from the present aspect of her,\" He was, in\r\nfact, unable to find a renter for the mill and let the land, twelve\r\nhundred acres, now worth millions, for only five hundred bushels\r\nof wheat!\r\n\r\nThe land had cost him far more than he had received from it. Simpson had\r\nnot proved a man of much energy and even had he been otherwise\r\nconditions in the region would have prevented him from accomplishing\r\nmuch in a financial way, for there was little or no market for farm\r\nproduce near at hand and the cost of transportation over the mountains\r\nwas prohibitive. During the Revolution, however, Simpson had in some way\r\nor other got hold of some paper currency and a few months before had\r\nturned over the worthless bills to Washington. A century later the\r\npackage was sold at auction, and the band, which was still unbroken,\r\nbore upon it in Washington's hand: \"Given by Gilbt. Simpson, 19\r\nJune, 1784.\"\r\n\r\nAt Simpson's Washington was met by a delegation from the squatters on\r\nhis holdings on Miller's Run or Chartiers Creek, \"and after much\r\nconversation & attempts in them to discover all the flaws they could in\r\nmy Deed &c.\" they announced that they would give a definite answer as to\r\nwhat they would do when Washington reached the land in dispute.\r\n\r\nHe drew near the neighborhood on the following Saturday, but the next\r\nday \"Being Sunday, and the People living on my Land, _apparently_ very\r\nreligious, it was thought best to postpone going among them till\r\nto-morrow.\" On Monday, in company with several persons including the\r\nhigh sheriff, Captain Van Swearingen, or \"Indian Van,\" captain of one of\r\nthe companies in Morgan's famous rifle corps, he proceeded to the land\r\nand found that, of two thousand eight hundred thirteen acres, three\r\nhundred sixty-three were under cultivation and forty more were in\r\nmeadow. On the land stood twelve cabins and nine barns claimed by\r\nfourteen different persons, most or all of whom were doughty\r\nScotch-Irishmen.\r\n\r\nWashington was humane enough to see that they had something to urge in\r\ntheir behalf and offered to sell them the whole tract at twenty-five\r\nshillings an acre, or to take them as tenants, but they stubbornly\r\nrefused his offers and after much wrangling announced their intention to\r\nstand suit. Ejectment proceedings were accordingly brought by\r\nWashington's attorney, Thomas Smith of Carlisle. The case was tried in\r\n1786 before the Supreme Court of Pennsylvania and resulted in\r\nWashington's favor.\r\n\r\nIn 1796 Washington sold the tract to a certain Matthew Richey for twelve\r\nthousand dollars, of which three thousand one hundred eighty dollars was\r\nto be paid in cash and the rest in three annual instalments. Richey died\r\nin 1798, and Washington's heirs had difficulties in their attempts to\r\ncollect the remainder.\r\n\r\nLeaving these legal matters to be disposed of by lawyers, Washington\r\nturned back without visiting his Kanawha or Ohio lands, and on October\r\nfourth reached Mount Vernon, having traveled on horseback about six\r\nhundred eighty miles. One result of his trip was the formation of the\r\nPotomac Company, but this is a subject that lies without the scope of\r\nthis book.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: The Seed House, Beyond Lay the Vegetable Garden]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: One of the Artificial Mounds. The Tree upon It was Set\r\nout by Mrs. Grover Cleveland.]\r\n\r\nFrom that time onward he bought occasional tracts of lands in various\r\nparts of the country or acquired them in discharge of debts. By the\r\ndeath of his mother he acquired her land on Accokeek Creek in Stafford\r\nCounty, near where his father had operated an iron furnace.\r\n\r\nWashington's landed estate as listed in his will amounted to about sixty\r\nthousand two hundred two acres, besides lots in Washington, Alexandria,\r\nWinchester, Bath, Manchester, Edinburgh and Richmond. Nine thousand two\r\nhundred twenty-seven acres, including Mount Vernon and a tract on Four\r\nMile Run, he specifically bequeathed to individuals, as he did some of\r\nthe lots. The remaining lots and fifty thousand nine hundred\r\nseventy-five acres (some of which land was already conditionally sold)\r\nhe directed to be disposed of, together with his live stock, government\r\nbonds and shares held by him in the Potomac Company, the Dismal Swamp\r\nCompany, the James River Company and the banks of Columbia and\r\nAlexandria--the whole value of which he conservatively estimated at five\r\nhundred and thirty thousand dollars. The value of the property he\r\nspecifically bequeathed, with his slaves, which he directed should be\r\nfreed, can only be guessed at, but can hardly have been short of two\r\nhundred and twenty thousand dollars more. In other words, he died\r\npossessed of property worth three-quarters of a million and was the\r\nrichest man in America.\r\n\r\nNot all of the land that he listed in his will proved of benefit to his\r\nheirs. The title to three thousand fifty-one acres lying on the Little\r\nMiami River in what is now Ohio and valued by him at fifteen thousand\r\ntwo hundred fifty-five dollars proved defective. In 1790 a law, signed\r\nby himself, had passed Congress requiring the recording of such\r\nlocations with the federal Secretary of State. Washington's locations\r\nand surveys of this Ohio land had already been recorded in the Virginia\r\nland office, and with a carelessness unusual in him he neglected to\r\ncomply with the statute. After his death certain persons took advantage\r\nof the defect and seized the lands, and his executors failed to embrace\r\nanother opportunity given them to perfect the title, with the result\r\nthat the lands were lost.\r\n\r\nThe matter rested until a few years ago when some descendants of the\r\nheirs set their heads together and one of them, Robert E. Lee, Jr.,\r\nprocured his appointment in 1907 by the court of Fairfax County as\r\nadministrator _de bonis non_ of Washington's estate. It was, of course,\r\nimpossible to regain the lands--which lie not far from Cincinnati and\r\nare worth vast sums--so the movers in the matter had recourse to that\r\nlast resort of such claimants--Congress--and, with the modesty usually\r\nshown by claimants, asked that body to reimburse the heirs in the sum of\r\nthree hundred and five thousand one hundred dollars--that is, one\r\nhundred dollars per acre--with interest from the date of petition.\r\n\r\nThus far Congress has not seen fit to comply, nor does there seem to be\r\nany good reason why it should do so. The land cost Washington a mere\r\nbagatelle, it was lost through the neglect of himself and his executors,\r\nand not one of the persons who would benefit by such a subsidy from the\r\npublic funds is his lineal descendant. As a mere matter of public policy\r\nand common sense it may well be doubted whether any claim upon\r\ngovernment, no matter how just in itself, should be reimbursed beyond\r\nthe third generation. The heirs urge in extenuation of the claim that\r\nWashington refused to accept any compensation for his Revolutionary\r\nservices, but it is answered that it is hardly seemly for his grand\r\nnephews and grand nieces many times removed to beg for something that\r\nthe Father of His Country himself rejected. One wonders whether the\r\nclaimants would dare to press their claims in the presence of their\r\ngreat Kinsman himself!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III\r\n\r\n\r\nVIRGINIA AGRICULTURE IN WASHINGTON'S DAY\r\n\r\nThe Virginia of George Washington's youth and early manhood was an\r\nimperial domain reaching from Atlantic tidewater through a thousand\r\nleagues of forests, prairies and mountains \"west and northwest\" to the\r\nSouth Sea. Only a narrow fringe along the eastern coast was settled by\r\nwhite men; the remainder was a terra incognita into which Knights of the\r\nGolden Horseshoe and Indian traders had penetrated a short distance,\r\nbringing back stories of endless stretches of wolf-haunted woodland, of\r\nshaggy-fronted wild oxen, of saline swamps in which reposed the whitened\r\nbones of prehistoric monsters, of fierce savage tribes whose boast was\r\nof the number of scalps that swung in the smoke of their wigwams. Even\r\nas late as 1750 the fertile Shenandoah Valley beyond the Blue Ridge\r\nformed the extreme frontier, while in general the \"fall line,\" where the\r\ndrop from the foothills to the coastal plain stops navigation, marked\r\nthe limit of settlement.\r\n\r\nAt the time that Washington began to farm in earnest eastern Virginia\r\nhad, however, been settled for one hundred fifty-two years. Yet the\r\npopulation was almost wholly rural. Williamsburg, the capital, was\r\nhardly more than a country village, and Norfolk, the metropolis,\r\nprobably did not contain more than five thousand inhabitants. The\r\npopulation generally was so scattered that, as has been remarked, a man\r\ncould not see his neighbor without a telescope or be heard by him\r\nwithout firing a gun.\r\n\r\nA large part of the settled land was divided up into great estates,\r\nthough there were many small farms. Some of these estates had been\r\nacquired for little or nothing by Cavalier favorites of the colonial\r\ngovernors. A few were perfectly enormous in size, and this was\r\nparticularly the rule on the \"Northern Neck,\" the region in which Mount\r\nVernon was situated. The holding of Lord Thomas Fairfax, the early\r\nfriend and patron of Washington, embraced more than a score of modern\r\ncounties and contained upward of five million acres. The grant had been\r\nmade by Fairfax's grandfather, Lord Culpeper, the coproprietor and\r\nGovernor of Virginia.\r\n\r\nThe Virginia plantation of 1760 was much more sufficient unto itself\r\nthan was the same plantation of the next century when methods of\r\ncommunication had improved, articles from the outside world were easier\r\nto obtain, and invention was beginning to become \"the mother of\r\nnecessity.\" Many of the large plantations, in fact, bore no small\r\nresemblance to medieval manors. There was the planter himself residing\r\nwith his family in the mansion, which corresponded to the manor house,\r\nand lording it over a crowd of white and black dependents, corresponding\r\nto serfs. The servants, both white and black, dwelt somewhat apart in\r\nthe quarters, rude log huts for the most part, but probably as\r\ncomfortable as those of the Saxon churls of the time of the\r\nPlantagenets. The planter's ownership over the persons of his dependents\r\nwas, however, much more absolute than was that of the Norman lord, for\r\non the manors the serfs could not be sold off the land, a restriction\r\nthat did not apply in Virginia either to black slaves or indentured\r\nservants. On the manor, furthermore, the serf had his own bits of\r\nground, for which he paid rent in kind, money or service, and the\r\nholdings passed from father to son; on the plantation the slave worked\r\nunder an overseer on his master's crops only and had nothing that he\r\ncould call his own--not even his wife or children. In the matter of the\r\norganization of industries there was a closer resemblance. The planter\r\ngenerally raised the staple articles of food for his family and slaves,\r\nas did the lord, and a large proportion of the other articles used or\r\nconsumed were manufactured on the place. A son of George Mason,\r\nWashington's close friend and neighbor, has left us the following\r\ndescription of industry at Gunston Hall:\r\n\r\n\"My father had among his slaves carpenters, coopers, sawyers,\r\nblacksmiths, tanners, curriers, shoemakers, spinners, weavers, and\r\nknitters, and even a distiller. His woods furnished timber and plank for\r\nthe carpenters and coopers, and charcoal for the blacksmith; his cattle\r\nkilled for his own consumption and for sale, supplied skins for the\r\ntanners, curriers, and shoemakers; and his sheep gave wool and his\r\nfields produced cotton and flax for the weavers and spinners, and his\r\nown orchards fruit for the distillers. His carpenters and sawyers built\r\nand kept in repair all the dwelling-houses, barns, stables, ploughs,\r\nharrows, gates, etc., on the plantations, and the outhouses of the\r\nhouse. His coopers made the hogsheads the tobacco was prized in, and\r\nthe tight casks to hold the cider and other liquors. The tanners and\r\ncurriers, with the proper vats, etc., tanned and dressed the skins as\r\nwell for upper as for lower leather to the full amount of the\r\nconsumption of the estate, and the shoemakers made them into shoes for\r\nthe negroes. A professed shoemaker was hired for three or four months in\r\nthe year to come and make up the shoes for the white part of the family.\r\nThe blacksmiths did all the iron work required by the establishment, as\r\nmaking and repairing ploughs, harrows, teeth, chains, bolts, etc. The\r\nspinners, weavers, and knitters made all the coarse cloths and stockings\r\nused by the negroes, and some of fine texture worn by the white family,\r\nnearly all worn by the children of it. The distiller made every fall a\r\ngood deal of apple, peach, and persimmon brandy. The art of distilling\r\nfrom grain was not then among us, and but few public distilleries. All\r\nthese operations were carried on at the home house, and their results\r\ndistributed as occasion required to the different plantations. Moreover,\r\nall the beeves and hogs for consumption or sale were driven up and\r\nslaughtered there at the proper seasons, and whatever was to be\r\npreserved was salted and packed away for distribution.\"\r\n\r\nNevertheless the plantation drew upon the outside world for many\r\narticles, especially luxuries, and the owner had to find the wherewithal\r\nto make payment. The almost universal answer to this problem\r\nwas--tobacco. It was not an ideal answer, and historians have scolded\r\nthe departed planters vigorously for doing the sum in that way, yet the\r\nplanters were victims of circumstances. They had no gold or silver mines\r\nfrom which to draw bullion that could be coined into cash; the fur trade\r\nwas of little importance compared with that farther north; the Europe of\r\nthat day raised sufficient meat and grain for its own use, and besides\r\nthese articles were bulky and costly to transport. But Europe did have a\r\nstrong craving for the weed and, almost of necessity, Virginians set\r\nthemselves to satisfying it. They could hardly be expected to do\r\notherwise when a pound of tobacco would often bring in England more than\r\na bushel of wheat, while it cost only a sixtieth part as much to send it\r\nthither. It is estimated that prior to the Revolution Virginia often\r\nsent out annually as much as ninety-six thousand hogsheads of tobacco.\r\nTobacco took the place of money, and debts, taxes and even ministers'\r\nsalaries were paid in it.\r\n\r\nThe disadvantages of tobacco culture are well known. Of all crops it is\r\nperhaps the most exhausting to the soil, nor was a large part of\r\nVirginia particularly fertile to begin with. Much land was speedily\r\nruined, but nothing was so cheap and plentiful in that day as land, so\r\nthe planter light-heartedly cleared more and let the old revert to the\r\nwilderness. Any one who travels through the long settled parts of\r\nVirginia to-day will see many such old fields upon which large forest\r\ntrees are now growing and can find there, if he will search closely\r\nenough, signs of the old tobacco ridges. Only heroic measures and the\r\nexpenditure of large sums for fertilizer could make such worn-out land\r\nagain productive. Washington himself described the character of the\r\nagriculture in words that can not be improved upon:\r\n\r\n\"A piece of land is cut down, and left under constant cultivation, first\r\nin tobacco, and then in Indian corn (two very exhausting plants), until\r\nit will yield scarcely anything; a second piece is cleared, and treated\r\nin the same manner; then a third and so on, until probably there is but\r\nlittle more to clear. When this happens, the owner finds himself reduced\r\nto the choice of one of three things--either to recover the land which\r\nhe has ruined, to accomplish which, he has perhaps neither the skill,\r\nthe industry, nor the means; or to retire beyond the mountains; or to\r\nsubstitute quantity for quality in order to raise something. The latter\r\nhas been generally adopted, and, with the assistance of horses, he\r\nscratches over much ground, and seeds it, to very little purpose.\"\r\n\r\nThe tobacco industry was not only ruinous to the soil, but it was badly\r\norganized from a financial standpoint. Three courses were open to the\r\nplanter who had tobacco. He might sell it to some local mercantile\r\nhouse, but these were not numerous nor as a rule conveniently situated\r\nto the general run of planters. He might deposit it in a tobacco\r\nwarehouse, receiving in return a receipt, which he could sell if he saw\r\nfit and could find a purchaser. Or he could send his tobacco direct to\r\nan English agent to be sold.\r\n\r\nIf a great planter and particularly if situated upon navigable water,\r\nthis last was the course he was apt to follow. He would have his own\r\nwharf to which once or twice a year a ship would come bringing the\r\nsupplies he had ordered months before and taking away the great staple.\r\nIf brought from a distance, the tobacco was rarely hauled to the wharf\r\nin wagons--the roads were too wretched for that--instead it was packed\r\nin a great cylindrical hogshead through which an iron or wooden axle was\r\nput. Horses or oxen were then hitched to the axle and the hogshead was\r\nrolled to its destination.\r\n\r\nBy the ship that took away his tobacco the planter sent to the English\r\nfactor a list of the goods he would require for the next year. It was an\r\nunsatisfactory way of doing business, for time and distance conspired to\r\nput the planter at the factor's mercy. The planter was not only unlikely\r\nto obtain a fair price for his product, but he had to pay excessive\r\nprices for poor goods and besides could never be certain that his order\r\nwould be properly filled.\r\n\r\nWashington's experiences with his English agents were probably fairly\r\ntypical. Near the close of 1759 he complained that Thomas Knox of\r\nBristol had failed to send him various things ordered, such as half a\r\ndozen scythes and stones, curry combs and brushes, weeding and grubbing\r\nhoes, and axes, and that now he must buy them in America at exorbitant\r\nprices. Not long afterward he wrote again: \"I have received my goods\r\nfrom the Recovery, and cant help again complaining of the little care\r\ntaken in the purchase: Besides leaving out half and the most material\r\nhalf too! of the Articles I sent for, I find the Sein is without Leads,\r\ncorks and Ropes which renders it useless--the crate of stone ware don't\r\ncontain a third of the Pieces I am charged with, and only two things\r\nbroken, and everything very high Charged.\"\r\n\r\nIn September of the same year he ordered, among other things, busts of\r\nAlexander the Great, Julius Caesar, Charles XII of Sweden, Frederick the\r\nGreat, Prince Eugene and the Duke of Marlborough; also of two wild\r\nbeasts. The order was \"filled\" by sending him a group showing Aeneas\r\nbearing his father from Troy, two groups with two statues of Bacchus and\r\nFlora, two ornamental vases and two \"Lyons.\"\r\n\r\n\"It is needless for me to particularise the sorts, quality, or taste I\r\nwoud choose to have them in unless it is observd,\" he wrote a year later\r\nto Robert Gary & Company of London apropos of some articles with which\r\nhe was dissatisfied, \"and you may believe me when I tell you that\r\ninstead of getting things good and fashionable in their several kind,\r\nwe often have articles sent us that coud only have been used by our\r\nForefathers in the days of yore--'Tis a custom, I have some reason to\r\nbelieve, with many Shop keepers, and Tradesmen in London when they know\r\nGoods are bespoke for Transportation to palm sometimes old, and\r\nsometimes very slight and indifferent goods upon us taking care at the\r\nsame time to advance 10, 15, or perhaps 20 pr. Ct. upon them.\"\r\n\r\nTo his London shoemaker he wrote, November 30, 1759, that the last two\r\npairs of dog leather pumps scarce lasted twice as many days. To his\r\ntailor he complained on another occasion of exorbitant prices. \"I shall\r\nonly refer you generally to the Bills you have sent me, particularly for\r\na Pompadour Suit forwarded last July amounting to £16.3.6 without\r\nembroidery, Lace or Binding--not a close fine cloth neither--and only a\r\ngold Button that woud not stand the least Wear.\"\r\n\r\nAnother time he mentions that his clothes fit poorly, which is not\r\nstrange considering that measurements had to be sent three thousand\r\nmiles and there, was no opportunity to try the garments on with a view\r\nto alterations. We may safely conclude, therefore, that however elegant\r\nVirginia society of that day may have been in other respects, it was\r\nnot distinguished for well fitting clothes!\r\n\r\nMost Virginia planters got in debt to their agents, and Washington was\r\nno exception to the rule. When his agents, Robert Gary & Company, called\r\nhis attention to the fact, he wrote them, that they seemed in a bit of a\r\nhurry considering the extent of past dealings with each other.\r\n\"Mischance rather than Misconduct hath been the cause of it,\" he\r\nasserted, explaining that he had made large purchases of land, that\r\ncrops had been poor for three seasons and prices bad. He preferred to\r\nlet the debt stand, but if the agents insisted upon payment now he would\r\nfind means to discharge the obligation.\r\n\r\nNot all planters could speak so confidently of their ability to find\r\nmeans to discharge a debt, for the truth is that the profits of tobacco\r\nculture were by no means so large as has often been supposed. A recent\r\nwriter speaks of huge incomes of twenty thousand to eighty thousand\r\npounds a year and asserts that \"the ordinary planter could count on an\r\nincome of from £3,000 to £6,000.\" The first figures are altogether\r\nfabulous, \"paper profits\" of the same sort that can be obtained by\r\ncalculating profits upon the geometrical increase of geese as\r\nillustrated in a well known story. Even the last mentioned sums were\r\nrealized only under the most favorable conditions and by a few planters.\r\nMuch of the time the price of the staple was low and the costs of\r\ntransportation and insurance, especially in time of war, were\r\nconsiderable. Washington himself had a consignment of tobacco captured\r\nby the French.\r\n\r\nThe planters were by no means so prosperous as is often supposed and\r\nneither was their life so splendid as has often been pictured. Writers\r\nseem to have entered into a sort of conspiracy to mislead us concerning\r\nit. The tendency is one to which Southern writers are particularly prone\r\nin all that concerns their section. If they speak of a lawyer, he is\r\nalways a profound student of the law; of a soldier, he is the bravest\r\ntenderest knight that ever trod shoe leather; of a lady, she is the most\r\nbeautiful that ever graced a drawing-room.\r\n\r\nThe old Virginia life had its color and charm, though its color and\r\ncharm lay in large part in things concerning which the writers have\r\nlittle or nothing to say. It is true that a few planters had their\r\ngorgeous coaches, yet Martha Washington remembered when there was only\r\none coach in the whole of Virginia, and throughout her life the roads\r\nwere so wretched that those who traveled over them in vehicles ran in\r\nimminent danger of being overturned, with possible dislocation of limbs\r\nand disjointing of necks. Virginians had their liveried servants,\r\nmahogany furniture, silver plate, silks and satins; an examination of\r\nthe old account books proves that they often had these and many other\r\nexpensive things, along with their Madeira and port wine. But the same\r\nbooks show that the planter was chronically in debt and that bankruptcy\r\nwas common, while accounts left by travelers reveal the fact that many\r\nof the mansion houses were shabby and run down, with rotting roofs,\r\nramshackle doors, broken windows into which old hats or other garments\r\nhad been thrust to keep the wind away. In a word, a traveler could find\r\nto-day more elegance in a back county of Arkansas than then existed in\r\ntidewater Virginia.\r\n\r\nThe tobacco industry was a culture that required much labor. In the\r\nspring a pile of brush was burned and on the spot thus fertilized and\r\nmade friable the seed were sowed. In due course the ground was prepared\r\nand the young plants were transplanted into rows. Later they must be\r\nrepeatedly plowed, hoed and otherwise cultivated and looked after and\r\nfinally the leaves must be cut or gathered and carried to the dry\r\nhouse to be dried. One man could care for only two or three acres, hence\r\nlarge scale cultivation required many hands--result, the importation of\r\nvast numbers of indentured servants and black slaves, with the blighting\r\neffects always consequent upon the presence of a servile class in a\r\ncommunity.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _By permission of the Mount Vernon Ladies' Association_\r\nThe Mount Vernon Kitchen (restored)]\r\n\r\nAlthough tobacco was the great staple, some of the Virginia planters had\r\nbegun before the Revolution to raise considerable crops of wheat, and\r\nmost of them from the beginning cultivated Indian corn. From the wheat\r\nthey made flour and bread for themselves, and with the corn they fed\r\ntheir hogs and horses and from it also made meal for the use of their\r\nslaves. In the culture of neither crop were they much advanced beyond\r\nthe Egyptians of the times of the Pyramids. The wheat was reaped with\r\nsickles or cradles and either flailed out or else trampled out by cattle\r\nand horses, usually on a dirt floor in the open air. Washington\r\nestimated in 1791 that the average crop of wheat amounted to only eight\r\nor ten bushels per acre, and the yield of corn was also poor.\r\n\r\nSo much emphasis was laid upon tobacco that many planters failed to\r\nproduce food enough. Some raised none at all, with the result that\r\noften both men and animals were poorly fed, and at best the cost of food\r\nand forage exhausted most of the profits. A somewhat similar condition\r\nexists in the South to-day with regard to cotton.\r\n\r\nAlmost no attention was paid to conserving the soil by rotation of\r\ncrops, and even those few planters who attempted anything of the sort\r\nfollowed the old plan of allowing fields to lie in a naked fallow and to\r\ngrow up in noxious weeds instead of raising a cover crop such as clover.\r\nWashington wrote in 1782: \"My countrymen are too much used to corn\r\nblades and corn shucks; and have too little knowledge of the profit of\r\ngrass land.\" And again in 1787:\r\n\r\n\"The general custom has been, first to raise a crop of Indian corn\r\n(maize) which, according to the mode of cultivation, is a good\r\npreparation for wheat; then a crop of wheat; after which the ground is\r\nrespited (except for weeds, and every trash that can contribute to its\r\nfoulness) for about eighteen months; and so on, alternately, without any\r\ndressing, till the land is exhausted; when it is turned out, without\r\nbeing sown with grass-seeds, or reeds, or any method taken to restore\r\nit; and another piece is ruined in the same manner. No more cattle is\r\nraised than can be supported by lowland meadows, swamps &c. and the\r\ntops and blades of Indian corn; as very few persons have attended to\r\ngrowing grasses, and connecting cattle with their crops. The Indian corn\r\nis the chief support of the labourers and their horses.\"\r\n\r\nAs for the use of fertilizer, very little was attempted, for, as\r\nJefferson explained, \"we can buy an acre of new land cheaper than we can\r\nmanure an old one.\" It was this cheapness of land that made it almost\r\nimpossible for the Virginians to break away from their ruinous\r\nsystem--ruinous, not necessarily to themselves, but to future\r\ngenerations. Conservation was then a doctrine that was little preached.\r\nPosterity could take care of itself. Only a few persons like Washington\r\nrealized their duty to the future.\r\n\r\nIn the matter of stock as well as in pure agriculture the Virginians\r\nwere backward. They showed to best advantage in the matter of horses.\r\nVirginia gentlemen were fond of horses, and some owned fine animals and\r\ncared for them carefully. A Randolph of Tuckahoe is said to have had a\r\nfavorite dapple-gray named \"Shakespeare\" for whom he built a special\r\nstable with a sort of recess next the stall in which the groom slept.\r\nGenerally speaking, however, even among the aristocracy the horses were\r\nnot so good nor so well cared for as in the next century.\r\n\r\nAmong the small farmers and poorer people the horses were apt to be\r\nscrubs, often mere bags of bones. A scientific English agriculturist\r\nnamed Parkinson, who came over in 1798, tells us that the American\r\nhorses generally \"leap well; they are accustomed to leap from the time\r\nof foaling; as it is not at all uncommon, if the mare foal in the night,\r\nfor some part of the family to ride the mare, with the foal following\r\nher, from eighteen to twenty miles next day, it not being customary to\r\nwalk much. I think that is the cause of the American horse having a sort\r\nof amble: the foal from its weak state, goes pacing after the dam, and\r\nretains that motion all its life. The same is the case with respect to\r\nleaping: there being in many places no gates, the snake or worm-fence\r\n(which is one rail laid on the end of another) is taken down to let the\r\nmare pass through, and the foal follow: but, as it is usual to leave two\r\nor three rails untaken down, which the mare leaps over, the foal,\r\nunwilling to be left behind, follows her; so that, by the time it is one\r\nweek old, it has learned to leap three feet high; and progressively, as\r\nit grows older, it leaps higher, till at a year old, it will leap its\r\nown height.\"\r\n\r\nSheep raising was not attempted to any great extent, partly because of\r\nthe ravages of wolves and dogs and partly because the sheep is a\r\nperverse animal that often seems to prefer dying to keeping alive and\r\nrequires skilled care to be made profitable. The breeds were various and\r\noften were degenerated. Travelers saw Holland or rat-tailed sheep, West\r\nIndian sheep with scant wool and much resembling goats, also a few\r\nSpanish sheep, but none would have won encomiums from a scientific\r\nEnglish breeder. The merino had not yet been introduced. Good breeds of\r\nsheep were difficult to obtain, for both the English and Spanish\r\ngovernments forbade the exportation of such animals and they could be\r\nobtained only by smuggling them out.\r\n\r\nIn 1792 Arthur Young expressed astonishment when told that wolves and\r\ndogs were a serious impediment to sheep raising in America, yet this was\r\nundoubtedly the case. The rich had their foxhounds, while every poor\r\nwhite and many negroes had from one to half a dozen curs--all of which\r\ncanines were likely to enjoy the sport of sheep killing. Mr. Richard\r\nPeters, a well informed farmer of Pennsylvania, said that wherever the\r\ncountry was much broken wolves were to be found and bred prodigiously.\r\n\"I lay not long ago at the foot of South Mountain, in York county, in\r\nthis State, in a country very thickly settled, at the house of a Justice\r\nof the Peace. Through the night I was kept awake by what I conceived to\r\nbe a jubilee of dogs, assembled to bay the moon. But I was told in the\r\nmorning, that what disturbed me, was _only_ the common howling of\r\nwolves, which nobody there regarded. When I entered the _Hall of\r\nJustice_, I found the 'Squire giving judgment for the reward on two wolf\r\nwhelps a countryman had taken from the bitch. The _judgment-seat_ was\r\nshaken with the intelligence, that the wolf was coming--_not to give\r\nbail_--but to devote herself or rescue her offspring. The animal was\r\npunished for this _daring contempt_, committed in the face of the court,\r\nand was shot within a hundred yards of the tribunal.\"\r\n\r\nVirginians had not yet learned the merits of grass and pasture, and\r\ntheir cattle, being compelled to browse on twigs and weeds, were often\r\nthin and poor. Many ranged through the woods and it was so difficult to\r\nget them up that sometimes they would not be milked for two or three\r\ndays. Often they gave no more than a quart of milk a day and were\r\nprobably no better in appearance than the historian Lecky tells us were\r\nthe wretched beasts then to be found in the Scottish Highlands.\r\n\r\nHogs received even less care than cattle and ran half wild in the woods\r\nlike their successors, the famous Southern razor-backs of to-day, being\r\nfed only a short period before they were to be transformed into pork.\r\nSays Parkinson:\r\n\r\n\"The real American hog is what is termed the wood-hog: they are long in\r\nthe leg, narrow on the back, short in the body, flat on the sides, with\r\na long snout, very rough in their hair, in make more like a fish called\r\na perch than anything I can describe. You may as well think of stopping\r\na crow as those hogs. They will go a distance from a fence, take a run,\r\nand leap through the rails, three or four feet from the ground, turning\r\nthemselves sidewise. These hogs suffer such hardships as no other animal\r\ncould endure. It is customary to keep them in the woods all winter, as\r\nthere is no thrashing or fold-yards; and they must live on the roots of\r\ntrees, or something of that sort, but they are poor beyond any creature\r\nthat I ever saw. That is probably the cause why American pork is so\r\nfine. They are something like forest-sheep. I am not certain, with\r\nAmerican keeping and treatment, if they be not the best: for I never saw\r\nan animal live without food, except this; and I am pretty sure they\r\nnearly do that. When they are fed, the flesh may well be sweet: it is\r\nall young, though the pig be ten years old.\"\r\n\r\n\"The aim of the farmers in this country (if they can be called\r\nfarmers),\" wrote Washington to Arthur Young in 1791, \"is, not to make\r\nthe most they can from the land, which is or has been cheap, but the\r\nmost of the labour, which is dear; the consequence of which has been,\r\nmuch ground has been _scratched_ over and none cultivated or improved as\r\nit ought to have been: whereas a farmer in England, where land is dear,\r\nand labour cheap, finds it his interest to improve and cultivate highly,\r\nthat he may reap large crops from a small quantity of ground.\"\r\n\r\nNo clearer statement of the differences between American and European\r\nagriculture has ever been formulated. Down to our own day the object of\r\nthe American farmer has continued to be the same--to secure the largest\r\nreturn from the expenditure of a given amount of labor. But we are on\r\nthe threshold of a revolution, the outcome of which means intensive\r\ncultivation and the realization of the largest possible return from a\r\ngiven amount of land.\r\n\r\nThat Washington saw the distinction so clearly is of itself sufficient\r\nproof that he pondered long and deeply upon agricultural problems.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IV\r\n\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON'S PROBLEM\r\n\r\n\"No estate in United America,\" wrote Washington to Arthur Young in 1793,\r\n\"is more pleasantly situated than this. It lies in a high, dry, and\r\nhealthy country, 300 miles by water from the sea, and, as you will see\r\nby the plan, on one of the finest rivers in the world. Its margin is\r\nwashed by more than ten miles of tide water; from the beds of which and\r\nthe innumerable coves, inlets, and small marshes, with which it abounds,\r\nan inexhaustible fund of mud may be drawn as a manure, either to be used\r\nseparately or in a compost....\r\n\r\n\"The soil of the tract of which I am speaking is a good loam, more\r\ninclined, however, to clay than sand. From use, and I might add, abuse,\r\nit is become more and more consolidated, and of course heavier\r\nto work....\r\n\r\n\"This river, which encompasses the land the distance above mentioned, is\r\nwell supplied with various kinds of fish at all seasons of the year;\r\nand, in the spring, with great profusion of shad, herring, bass, carp,\r\nperch, sturgeon, etc. Several fisheries appertain to the estate; the\r\nwhole shore, in short, is one entire fishery.\"\r\n\r\nThe Mount Vernon estate, amounting in the end to over eight thousand\r\nacres, was, with the exception of a few outlying tracts, subdivided into\r\nfive farms, namely, the Mansion House Farm, the Union Farm, the Dogue\r\nRun Farm, Muddy Hole Farm and the River Farm.\r\n\r\nOn the Mansion House Farm stood the owner's residence, quarters for the\r\nnegroes and other servants engaged upon that particular estate, and\r\nother buildings. The land in general was badly broken and poor in\r\nquality; much of it was still in woodland.\r\n\r\nThe River Farm lay farthest up the Potomac, being separated from the\r\nothers by the stream known as Little Hunting Creek. Visitors to Mount\r\nVernon to-day, traveling by trolley, cross this farm and stream. It\r\ncontained more tillable ground than any other, about twelve hundred\r\nacres. In 1793 it had an \"overlooker's\" house of one large and two small\r\nrooms below and one or two rooms above, quarters for fifty or sixty\r\nnegroes, a large barn and stables gone much to decay.\r\n\r\nMuddy Hole Farm lay across Little Hunting Creek from the River Farm and\r\nback of the Mansion House Farm and had no frontal upon the Potomac. It\r\ncontained four hundred seventy-six acres of tillable soil and had in\r\n1793 a small overlooker's house, \"covering for about 30 negroes, and a\r\ntolerable good barn, with stables for the work-horses.\"\r\n\r\nUnion Farm lay just below the Mansion House Farm and contained nine\r\nhundred twenty-eight acres of arable land and meadow. In 1793 it had, in\r\nWashington's words, \"a newly erected brick barn, equal, perhaps, to any\r\nin America, and for conveniences of all sorts, particularly for\r\nsheltering and feeding horses, cattle, &c. scarcely to be exceeded any\r\nwhere.\" A new house of four rooms was building, and there were quarters\r\nfor fifty odd negroes. On this farm was the old Posey fishery and ferry\r\nto Maryland.\r\n\r\nDogue Run Farm, of six hundred fifty acres, lay back of Union Farm and\r\nupon it in 1793 stood the grist mill and later a distillery and the\r\nfamous sixteen-sided \"new circular barn, now finishing on a new\r\nconstruction; well calculated, it is conceived, for getting grain out\r\nof the straw more expeditiously than the usual mode of threshing.\" It\r\nhad a two-room overseer's house, covering for forty odd negroes, and\r\nsheds sufficient for thirty work horses and oxen. Washington considered\r\nit much the best of all his farms. It was this farm that he bequeathed\r\nto Nelly Custis and her husband, Lawrence Lewis, and upon it they\r\nerected \"Woodlawn,\" which is shown in the photograph herewith\r\nreproduced.\r\n\r\nNot long since I rambled on foot over the old estate and had an\r\nopportunity to compare the reality, or what remains of it, with\r\nWashington's description. I left the Mansion House, often visited\r\nbefore, and strolled down the long winding drive that runs between the\r\nstunted evergreens and oaks through the old lodge gate and passed from\r\nthe domain, kept trim and parklike by the Association, out upon the\r\nunkempt and vastly greater part of the old Mount Vernon.\r\n\r\nIt was early morning, about the hour when in the long past the master of\r\nthe estate used to ride out on his tour of inspection. The day was one\r\nof those delicious days in early autumn when earth and sky and air and\r\nall things in nature seem kindly allied to help the heart of man leap up\r\nin gladness and to enable him to understand how there came to be a poet\r\ncalled Wordsworth. Meadow-larks were singing in the grass, and once in\r\nan old hedgerow over-grown with sweet-smelling wild honeysuckle I saw a\r\ncovey of young quails. These hedgerows of locust and cedar are broken\r\nnow, but along the old road to the mill and Pohick Church and between\r\nfields the scattered trees and now and then a bordering ditch are\r\nevidences of the old owner's handiwork.\r\n\r\nThen and later I visited all the farms, the site of the old mill, of\r\nwhich only a few stones remain, the mill stream, the fishery and old\r\nferry landing. I walked across the gullied fields and examined the soil,\r\nI noted the scanty crops they bear to-day and gained a clearer idea of\r\nwhat Washington's problem had been than I could have done from a\r\nlibrary of books.\r\n\r\nTruly the estate is \"pleasantly situated,\" though even to-day it seems\r\nout of the world and out of the way. One must go far to find so\r\nsatisfying a view as that from the old Mansion House porch across the\r\nmile of shining water to the Maryland hills' crowned with trees\r\nglorified by the Midas-touch of frost. The land does lie \"high\" and\r\n\"dry,\" but we must take exception to the word \"healthy.\" In the summer\r\nand fall the tidal marshes breed a variety of mosquito capable of biting\r\nthrough armor plate and of infecting the devil himself with malaria. In\r\nthe General's day, when screens were unknown, a large part of the\r\npopulation, both white and black, suffered every August and September\r\nfrom chills and fever. The master himself was not exempt and once we\r\nfind him chronicling that he went a-hunting and caught a fox and\r\nthe ague.\r\n\r\nWhat he says as regards the fisheries is all quite true and in general\r\nthey seem to have been very productive. Herring and shad were the chief\r\nfish caught and when the run came the seine was carried well out into\r\nthe river in a boat and then hauled up on the shelving beach either by\r\nhand or with a windlass operated by horse-power. There were warehouses\r\nand vats for curing the fish, a cooper shop and buildings for sheltering\r\nthe men. The fish were salted down for the use of the family and the\r\nslaves, and what surplus remained was sold. Now and then the landing and\r\noutfit was rented out for a money consideration, but this usually\r\nhappened only when the owner was away from home.\r\n\r\nAt the old Posey fishery on Union Farm the industry is still carried on,\r\nthough gasoline engines have been substituted for the horse-operated\r\nwinch used in drawing the seines. Lately the industry has ceased to be\r\nvery productive, and an old man in charge told me that it is because\r\nfishermen down the river and in Chesapeake Bay are so active that\r\ncomparatively few fish manage to get up so far.\r\n\r\nThe Mount Vernon estate in the old days lacked only one quality\r\nnecessary to make it extremely productive, namely, rich soil! Only\r\nignorance of what good land really is, or an owner's blind pride in his\r\nown estate, can justify the phrase \"a good loam.\" On most of the estate\r\nthe soil is thin, varying in color from a light gray to a yellow red,\r\nwith below a red clay hardpan almost impervious to water. To an observer\r\nbrought up on a farm of the rich Middle West, Mount Vernon, except for a\r\nfew scattered fields, seems extremely poor land. For farming purposes\r\nmost of it would be high at thirty dollars an acre. Much of it is so\r\nbroken by steep hills and deep ravines as scarcely to be tillable at\r\nall. Those tracts which are cultivated are very susceptible to erosion.\r\nDeep gullies are quickly worn on the hillsides and slopes. At one time\r\nsuch a gully on Union Farm extended almost completely across a large\r\nfield and was deep enough to hide a horse, but Washington filled it up\r\nwith trees, stumps, stones, old rails, brush and dirt, so that scarcely\r\na trace of it was left. In places one comes upon old fields that have\r\nbeen allowed to revert to broom sedge, scrub oak and scrub pine. One is\r\nastonished at the amount that has never been cleared at all. Only by the\r\nmost careful husbandry could such an estate be kept productive. It never\r\ncould be made to yield bumper crops.\r\n\r\nThe situation confronting \"Farmer Washington\" was this: He had a great\r\nabundance of land, but most of it on his home estate was mediocre in\r\nquality. Some of that lying at a distance was more fertile, but much of\r\nit was uncleared and that on the Ohio was hopelessly distant from a\r\nmarket. With the exception of Mount Vernon even those plantations in\r\nVirginia east of the Blue Ridge could not be looked after in person. He\r\nmust either rent them, trust them to a manager, or allow them to lie\r\nidle. Even the Mount Vernon land was distant from a good market, and the\r\ncost of transportation was so great that he must produce for selling\r\npurposes articles of little bulk compared with value. Finally, he had an\r\nincreasing number of slaves for whom food and clothing must be provided.\r\n\r\nHis answer to the problem of a money crop was for some years the old\r\nVirginia answer--tobacco. His far western lands he left for the most\r\npart untenanted. Those plantations in settled regions but remote from\r\nhis home he generally rented for a share of the crop or for cash. The\r\nstaple articles that he produced to feed the slaves were pork and corn,\r\neked out by herring from the fishery.\r\n\r\nFrom his accounts we find that in 1759 he made thirty-four thousand one\r\nhundred sixty pounds of tobacco; the next year sixty-five thousand\r\nthirty-seven pounds; in 1763, eighty-nine thousand seventy-nine pounds,\r\nwhich appears to have been his banner tobacco crop. In 1765 the quantity\r\nfell to forty-one thousand seven hundred ninety-nine pounds; in 1771, to\r\ntwenty-nine thousand nine hundred eighty-six pounds, and in 1773 to only\r\nabout five thousand pounds. Thereafter his crop of the weed was\r\nnegligible, though we still find occasional references to it even as\r\nlate as 1794, when he states that he has twenty-five hogsheads in the\r\nwarehouses of Alexandria, where he has held it for five or six years\r\nbecause of low prices.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Looking across part of Dogue Run Farm to \"Woodlawn,\" the\r\nHome of Nelly Custis Lewis]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Gully on a Field of Union Farm, Showing Susceptibility to\r\nErosion]\r\n\r\nHe tried to raise a good quality and seems to have concentrated on\r\nwhat he calls the \"sweet scented\" variety, but for some reason, perhaps\r\nbecause his soil was not capable of producing the best, he obtained\r\nlower prices than did some of the other Virginia planters, and grumbled\r\nat his agents accordingly.\r\n\r\nHe early realized the ruinous effects of tobacco on his land and sought\r\nto free himself from its clutches by turning to the production of wheat\r\nand flour for the West India market. Ultimately he was so prejudiced\r\nagainst the weed that in 1789 we find him in a contract with a tenant\r\nnamed Gray, to whom he leased a tract of land for ten pounds,\r\nstipulating that Gray should make no more tobacco than he needed for\r\n\"chewing and smoaking in his own family.\"\r\n\r\nLate in life he decided that his land was not congenial to corn, in\r\nwhich he was undoubtedly right, for the average yield was only about\r\nfifteen bushels per acre. In the corn country farmers now often produce\r\na hundred. He continued to raise corn only because it was essential for\r\nhis negroes and hogs. In 1798 he contracted with William A. Washington\r\nto supply him with five hundred barrels annually to eke out his own\r\ncrop. Even this quantity did not prove sufficient, for we find him next\r\nyear trying to engage one hundred barrels more.\r\n\r\nBefore this time his main concern had come to be to conserve his soil\r\nand he had turned his attention largely to grass and live stock. Of\r\nthese matters more hereafter.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER V\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE STUDENT OF AGRICULTURE\r\n\r\nWashington took great pains to inform himself concerning any subject in\r\nwhich he was interested and hardly was he settled down to serious\r\nfarming before he was ordering from England \"the best System now extant\r\nof Agriculture,\" Shortly afterward he expressed a desire for a book\r\n\"lately published, done by various hands, but chiefly collected from the\r\npapers of Mr. Hale. If this is known to be the best, pray send it, but\r\nnot if any other is in high esteem.\" Another time he inquires for a\r\nsmall piece in octavo, \"a new system of Agriculture, or a speedy way to\r\ngrow rich.\"\r\n\r\nAmong his papers are preserved long and detailed notes laboriously taken\r\nfrom such works as Tull's _Horse-Hoeing Husbandry_, Duhamel's _A\r\nPractical Treatise of Husbandry, The Farmer's Compleat Guide,_ Home's\r\n_The Gentleman Farmer_, and volumes of Young's _Annals of Agriculture_.\r\n\r\nThe abstracts from the _Annals_ were taken after the Revolution and\r\nprobably before he became President, for the first volume did not appear\r\nuntil 1784. From the handwriting it is evident that the digests of\r\nTull's and Duhamel's books were made before the Revolution and probably\r\nabout 1760. In the midst of the notes on chapter eight of the _Compleat\r\nGuide_ there are evidences of a long hiatus in time--Mr. Fitzpatrick of\r\nthe manuscript division of the Library of Congress thinks perhaps as\r\nmuch as eight or ten years. A vivid imagination can readily conceive\r\nWashington's laying aside the task for the more important one of\r\nvindicating the liberties of his countrymen and taking it up again only\r\nwhen he had sheathed the sword. But all we can say is that for some\r\nreason he dropped the work for a considerable time, the evidence being\r\nthat the later handwriting differs perceptibly from that which\r\nprecedes it.\r\n\r\nAs most of Washington's agricultural ideas were drawn from these books,\r\nit is worth while for us to examine them. I have not been able to put my\r\nhands on Washington's own copies, but in the library of the Department\r\nof Agriculture I have examined the works of Tull, Duhamel and Young.\r\n\r\nTull's _Horse-Hoeing Husbandry_ was an epoch-making book in the history\r\nof English agriculture. It was first published in 1731 and the third\r\nedition, the one I have seen and probably the one that Washington\r\npossessed, appeared in 1751. Possibly it was the small piece in octavo,\r\n\"a new system of Agriculture, or a speedy way to grow rich\" concerning\r\nwhich he wrote to his agent. It deals with a great variety of subjects,\r\nsuch as of roots and leaves, of food of plants, of pasture, of plants,\r\nof weeds, of turnips, of wheat, of smut, of blight, of St. Foin, of\r\nlucerne, of ridges, of plows, of drill boxes, but its one great thesis\r\nwas the careful cultivation by plowing of such annuals as potatoes,\r\nturnips, and wheat, crops which hitherto had been tended by hand or left\r\nto fight their battle unaided after having once been planted.\r\n\r\nDuhamel's book was the work of a Frenchman whose last name was Monceau.\r\nIt was based in part upon Tull's book, but contained many reflections\r\nsuggested by French experience as well as some additions made by the\r\nEnglish translator. The English translation appeared in 1759, the year\r\nof Washington's marriage. It dealt with almost every aspect of\r\nagriculture and stock raising, advocated horse-hoeing, had much to say\r\nin favor of turnips, lucerne, clover and such crops, and contained\r\nplates and descriptions of various plows, drills and other kinds of\r\nimplements. It also contained a detailed table of weather observations\r\nfor a considerable time, which may have given Washington the idea of\r\nkeeping his meteorological records.\r\n\r\nYoung's _Annals_ was an elaborate agricultural periodical not unlike in\r\nsome respects publications of this sort to-day except for its lack of\r\nadvertising. It contains records of a great variety of experiments in\r\nboth agriculture and stock raising, pictures and descriptions of plows,\r\nmachines for rooting up trees, and other implements and machines, plans\r\nfor the rotation of crops, and articles and essays by experimental\r\nfarmers of the day. Among its contributors were men of much eminence,\r\nand we come upon articles by Mr. William Pitt on storing turnips, Mr.\r\nWilliam Pitt on deep plowing; George III himself contributed under the\r\npen name of \"Ralph Robinson.\" The man who should follow its directions\r\neven to-day would not in most matters go far wrong.\r\n\r\nAs one looks over these publications he realizes that the scientific\r\nfarmers of that day were discussing many problems and subjects that\r\nstill interest those of the present. The language is occasionally\r\nquaint, but the principles set down are less often wrong than might be\r\nsupposed. To be sure, Tull denied that different plants require\r\ndifferent sorts of food and, notes Washington, \"gives many unanswerable\r\nReasons to prove it,\" but he combats the notion that the soil ever\r\ncauses wheat to degenerate into rye. This he declares \"as ridiculous as\r\nit would be to say that an horse by feeding in a certain pasture will\r\ndegenerate into a Bull.\" And yet it is not difficult to discover farmers\r\nto-day who will stubbornly argue that \"wheat makes cheat.\" Tull also\r\nadvocated the idea that manure should be put on green and plowed under\r\nin order to obtain anything like its full benefit, as well as many other\r\nsound ideas that are still disregarded by many American farmers.\r\n\r\nWashington eagerly studied the works that have been mentioned, and much\r\nof his time when at Mount Vernon was devoted to experiments designed to\r\nascertain to what extent the principles that were sound in England could\r\nbe successfully applied in an American environment.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VI\r\n\r\n\r\nA FARMER'S RECORDS AND OTHER PAPERS\r\n\r\nWashington was the most methodical man that ever lived. He had a place\r\nfor everything and insisted that everything should be kept in its place.\r\nThere was nothing haphazard about his methods of business. He kept exact\r\naccounts of financial dealings.\r\n\r\nHis habit of setting things down on paper was one that developed early.\r\nHe kept a journal of his surveying experiences beyond the Blue Ridge in\r\n1748, another of his trip to Barbadoes with his brother Lawrence in\r\n1751-52, another of his trip to Fort Le Boeuf to warn out the French,\r\nand yet another of his Fort Necessity campaign. The words are often\r\nmisspelled, many expressions are ungrammatical, but the handwriting is\r\ngood and the judgments expressed, even those set down when he was only\r\nsixteen, are the mature judgments of a man.\r\n\r\nA year after his marriage he began a formal diary, which he continued\r\nuntil June 19, 1775, the time of his appointment to command the army of\r\nthe Revolution. He called it his _Diary_ and later _Where, & how my time\r\nis Spent_. In it he entered the happenings of the day, his agricultural\r\nand other experiments, a record of his guests and also a detailed\r\naccount of the weather.\r\n\r\nHis attention to this last matter was most particular. Often when away\r\nfrom home he would have a record kept and on his return would\r\nincorporate it into his book. Exactly what advantages he expected to\r\nderive therefrom are not apparent, though I presume that he hoped to\r\ndraw conclusions as to the best time for planting crops. In reading it I\r\nwas many times reminded of a Cleveland octogenarian who for fifty-seven\r\nyears kept a record twice a day of the thermometer and barometer. Near\r\nthe end of his life he brought the big ledgers to the Western Reserve\r\nHistorical Society, and I happened to be present on the occasion. \"You\r\nhave studied the subject for a long time,\" I said to him. \"Are there any\r\nconclusions you have been able to reach as a result of your\r\ninvestigation?\" He thought a minute and passed a wrinkled hand across a\r\nwrinkled brow. \"Nothing but this,\" he made answer, \"that Cleveland\r\nweather is only constant in its inconstancy.\"\r\n\r\nWe would gladly exchange some of these meteorological details for\r\nfurther information about Washington's own personal doings and feelings.\r\nOf the latter the diaries reveal little. Washington was an objective\r\nman, above all in his papers. He sets down what happens and says little\r\nabout causes, motives or mental impressions. When on his way to Yorktown\r\nto capture Cornwallis he visited his home for the first time in six\r\nweary years, yet merely recorded: \"I reached my own Seat at Mount Vernon\r\n(distant 120 Miles from the Hd. of Elk) where I staid till the 12th.\"\r\n\r\nNot a word of the emotions which that visit must have roused!\r\n\r\nFor almost six years after 1775 there is a gap in the diary, though for\r\nsome months of 1780 he sets down the weather. On May I, 1781, he begins\r\na new record, which he calls a _Journal_, and he expresses regret that\r\nhe has not had time to keep one all the time. The subjects now\r\nconsidered are almost wholly military and the entries reveal a different\r\nman from that of 1775. The grammar is better, the vocabulary larger, the\r\ntone more elevated, the man himself is bigger and broader with an\r\ninfinitely wider viewpoint.\r\n\r\nFrom November 5, 1781, for more than three years there is another\r\nblank, except for the journal of his trip to his western lands already\r\nreferred to. But on January 1, 1785, he begins a new _Diary_ and\r\nthenceforward continues it, with short intermissions, until the day of\r\nhis last ride over his estate.\r\n\r\nA few of the diaries and journals have been lost, but most are still in\r\nexistence. Some are in the Congressional Library and there also is the\r\nToner transcript of these records. The transcript makes thirty-seven\r\nlarge volumes. The diary is one of the main sources from which the\r\nmaterial for this book is drawn.\r\n\r\nThe original of the record of events for 1760 is a small book, perhaps\r\neight or ten inches long by four inches wide and much yellowed by age.\r\nPart of the first entry stands thus:\r\n\r\n\"January 1, Tuesday\r\n\r\n\"Visited my Plantations and received an Instance of Mr. French's great\r\nLove of Money in disappointing me of some Pork because the price had\r\nrisen to 22.6 after he had engaged to let me have it at 20 s.\"\r\n\r\nOn his return from his winter ride he found Mrs. Washington \"broke out\r\nwith the Meazles.\" Next day he states with evident disgust that he has\r\ntaken the pork on French's own terms.\r\n\r\nThe weather record for 1760 was kept on blank pages of _The Virginia\r\nAlmanac_, a compendium that contains directions for making \"Indico,\" for\r\ncuring bloody flux, for making \"Physick as pleasant as a Dish of\r\nChocolate,\" for making a striking sun-dial, also \"A Receipt to keep\r\none's self warm a whole Winter with a single Billet of Wood.\" To do this\r\nlast \"Take a Billet of Wood of a competent Size, fling it out of the\r\nGarret-Window into the Yard, run down Stairs as hard as ever you can\r\ndrive; and when you have got it, run up again with it at the same\r\nMeasure of Speed; and thus keep throwing down, and fetching up, till the\r\nExercise shall have sufficiently heated you. This renew as often as\r\nOccasion shall require. _Probatum est_.\"\r\n\r\nThis receipt would seem worth preserving in this day of dear fuel. As\r\nWashington had great abundance of wood and plenty of negroes to cut it,\r\nhe probably did not try the experiment--at least such a conclusion is\r\nwhat writers on historical method would call \"a safe inference.\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration: First Page of Washington's Digest of Duhamel's Husbandry]\r\n\r\nThere is in the almanac a rhyme ridiculing physicians and above the\r\nMarch calendar are printed the touching verses:\r\n\r\n     \"Thus of all Joy and happiness bereft,\r\n     And with the Charge of Ten poor Children left:\r\n     A greater Grief no Woman sure can know,\r\n     Who,--with Ten Children--who will have me now.\"\r\n\r\nAlso there are some other verses, very broad and \"not quite the proper\r\nthing,\" as Kipling has it. But it must not be inferred that Washington\r\napproved of them.\r\n\r\nWashington also kept cash memorandum books, general account books, mill\r\nbooks and a special book in which he recorded his accounts with the\r\nestate of the Custis children. These old books, written in his neat\r\nlegible hand, are not only one of our chief sources of information\r\nconcerning his agricultural and financial affairs, but contain many\r\nsidelights upon historical events. It is extremely interesting, for\r\nexample, to discover in one of the account books that in 1775 at Mount\r\nVernon he lent General Charles Lee--of Monmouth fame--£15, and \"to Ditto\r\nlent him on the Road from Phila to Cambridge at different times\" £9.12\r\nmore, a total of £24.12. In later years Lee intrigued against Washington\r\nand said many spiteful things about him, but he never returned the loan.\r\nThe account stood until 1786, when it was settled by Alexander White,\r\nLee's executor.\r\n\r\nIn the Cash Memorandum books we can trace Washington's military\r\npreparations at the beginning of the Revolution. Thus on June 2, 1775,\r\nbeing then at Philadelphia, he enters: \"By Expences bringing my Horses\r\nfrom Baltimore,\" £2.5. Next day he pays thirty pounds for \"Cartouch\r\nBoxes &c. for Prince Wm. Comp.\" June 6, \"By Covering my Holsters,\"\r\n£0.7.6; \"By a Cersingle,\" £0.7.6; \"By 5 Books--Military,\" £1.12.0. He\r\nwas preparing for Gage and Howe and Cornwallis and whether the knowledge\r\ncontained in the books was of value or not he somehow managed for eight\r\nyears to hold his opponents at bay and ultimately to win. At Cambridge,\r\nJuly tenth, he spends three shillings and four pence for a \"Ribbon to\r\ndistinguish myself,\" that is to show his position as commander; also\r\n£1.2.6 for \"a pair of Breeches for Will,\" his colored body servant.\r\n\r\nA vast number of papers bear witness to his interest in agriculture and\r\nwith these we are particularly concerned. He preserved most of the\r\nletters written to him and many of these deal with farming matters.\r\nDuring part of his career he had a copying press and kept copies of his\r\nown important letters, while many of the originals have been preserved,\r\nthough widely scattered. When away from home he required his manager to\r\nsend him elaborate weekly reports containing a meteorological table of\r\neach day's weather, the work done on each farm, what each person did,\r\nwho was sick, losses and increases in stock, and other matters of\r\ninterest. Scores of these reports are still in existence and are\r\ninvaluable. He himself wrote--generally on Sunday--lengthy weekly\r\nletters of inquiry, direction, admonition and reproof, and if the\r\nmanager failed in the minutest matter to give an account of some phase\r\nof the farm work, he would be sure to hear of it in the proprietor's\r\nnext letter.\r\n\r\nWashington's correspondence on agricultural matters with Arthur Young\r\nand Sir John Sinclair, eminent English agriculturists, was collected\r\nsoon after his death in a volume that is now rare. In it are a number of\r\nletters written by other American farmers, including Thomas Jefferson,\r\nrelative to agriculture in their localities. These letters were the\r\nresult of inquiries made of Washington by Young in 1791. In order to\r\nobtain the facts desired Washington sent out a circular letter to some\r\nof the most intelligent farmers in the Middle States, and the replies\r\nform perhaps our best source of information regarding agricultural\r\nconditions in that period.\r\n\r\nBecause of this service and of his general interest in agricultural\r\nmatters Washington was elected a foreign honorary member of the English\r\nBoard of Agriculture and received a diploma, which is still preserved\r\namong his papers.\r\n\r\nSome of Washington's other agricultural papers have been printed in one\r\nform and another, but a great number, and some the most interesting, can\r\nstill be consulted only in manuscript.\r\n\r\nWashington bequeathed his books and papers, along with his Mansion\r\nHouse, to his nephew, Bushrod Washington, an associate justice of the\r\nFederal Supreme Court. Judge Washington failed to appreciate fully the\r\nseriousness of the obligation thus incurred and instead of safeguarding\r\nthe papers with the utmost jealousy gave many, including volumes of the\r\ndiary, to visitors and friends who expressed a desire to possess\r\nmementoes of the illustrious patriot. In particular he permitted\r\nReverend William Buel Sprague, who had been a tutor in the family of\r\nNelly Custis Lewis, to take about fifteen hundred papers on condition\r\nthat he leave copies in their places. The judge also intrusted a\r\nconsiderable portion to the historian Jared Sparks, who issued the first\r\nconsiderable edition of Washington's writings. Sparks likewise was\r\nguilty of giving away souvenirs.\r\n\r\nBushrod Washington died in 1829 and left the papers and letter books for\r\nthe most part to his nephew John Corbin Washington. In 1834 the nation\r\npurchased of this gentleman the papers of a public character, paying\r\ntwenty-five thousand dollars. The owner reserved the private papers,\r\nincluding invoices, ciphering book, rules of civility, etc., but in 1849\r\nsold these also to the same purchaser for twenty thousand dollars. The\r\npapers were kept for many years in the Department of State, but in the\r\nadministration of Theodore Roosevelt most of them were transferred to\r\nthe Library of Congress, where they could be better cared for and would\r\nbe more accessible.\r\n\r\nBushrod Washington gave to another nephew, John Augustine Washington,\r\nthe books and relics in the dining-room of the Mansion House. In course\r\nof time these were scattered, some being bought for the Boston\r\nAthenaeum, which has decidedly the larger part of Washington's library;\r\nothers were purchased by the state of New York, and yet others were\r\nexhibited at the Centennial Exposition and were later sold at auction.\r\nAmong the relics bought by New York was a sword wrongly said to have\r\nbeen sent to the General by Frederick the Great.\r\n\r\nOne hundred and twenty-seven of his letters, mostly to William Pearce,\r\nhis manager at Mount Vernon during a portion of his presidency, were\r\nbought from the heirs of Pearce by the celebrated Edward Everett and now\r\nbelong to the Long Island Historical Society. These have been published.\r\nHis correspondence with Tobias Lear, for many years his private\r\nsecretary, are now in the collection of Thomas K. Bixby, a wealthy\r\nbibliophile of St. Louis. These also have been published. The one\r\ngreatest repository of papers is the Library of Congress. Furthermore,\r\nthrough the unwearying activities of J. M. Toner, who devoted years to\r\nthe work, the Library also has authenticated copies of many papers of\r\nwhich it does not possess the originals.\r\n\r\nAll told, according to Mr. Gaillard Hunt, who has them in charge, the\r\nWashington manuscripts in the Library of Congress is the largest\r\ncollection of papers of one person in the world. The collection contains\r\nabout eighteen thousand papers in his own hand, press copies, or drafts\r\nin the writing of his secretaries, and many times that number of others.\r\nAs yet all except a small part are merely arranged in chronological\r\norder, but soon it is to be sumptuously bound in royal purple levant.\r\nThe color, after all, is fitting, for he was a King and he reigns still\r\nin the hearts of his countrymen.\r\n\r\nBenjamin Franklin knew the great men of earth of his time, the princes\r\nand kings of blood royal. Near the close of his life he wrote in his\r\nwill: \"My fine crabtree walking-stick with a gold head, curiously\r\nwrought in the form of a cap of Liberty, I give to my friend, and the\r\nfriend of mankind, General Washington. If it was a sceptre, he has\r\nmerited it, and would become it.\"\r\n\r\nAnd thus Thackeray, who knew the true from the false, the dross from\r\npure gold: \"Which was the most splendid spectacle ever witnessed, the\r\nopening feast of Prince George in London or the resignation of\r\nWashington? Which is the noble character for ages to admire--yon fribble\r\ndancing in lace and spangles, or yonder hero who sheathes his sword\r\nafter a life of spotless honor, a purity unreproached, a courage\r\nindomitable, and a consummate victory? Which of these is the true\r\ngentleman? What is it to be a gentleman? Is it to have lofty aims, to\r\nlead a pure life, to keep your honor virgin; to have the esteem of your\r\nfellow-citizens, and the love of your fireside; to bear good fortune\r\nmeekly; to suffer evil with constancy; and through evil or good to\r\nmaintain truth always? Show me the happy man whose life exhibits these\r\nqualities, and him will we salute as gentleman, whatever his rank may\r\nbe; show me the prince who possesses them, and he may be sure of our\r\nlove and loyalty.\"\r\n\r\n'Tis often distance only that lends enchantment, but it is Washington's\r\nproud pre-eminence that he can bear the microscope. Having read\r\nthousands of his letters and papers dealing with almost every\r\nconceivable subject in the range of human affairs, I yet feel inclined,\r\nnay compelled, to bear witness to the greatness of his heart, soul and\r\nunderstanding. He was human. He had his faults. He made his mistakes.\r\nBut I would not detract a line from any eulogium of him ever uttered.\r\nWords have never yet been penned that do him justice.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VII\r\n\r\n\r\nAGRICULTURAL OPERATIONS AND EXPERIMENTS BEFORE THE REVOLUTION\r\n\r\nA detailed account of all of Washington's agricultural experiments would\r\nrequire several hundred pages and would be tedious reading. All that I\r\nshall attempt to do is to give some examples and point the way for any\r\nenthusiast to the mass of his agricultural papers in the Library of\r\nCongress and elsewhere.\r\n\r\nAt the outset it should be stated that he worked under extremely\r\ndifferent conditions from those of to-day. Any American farmer of the\r\npresent who has a problem in his head can have it solved by writing to\r\nthe nearest government experiment station, a good farm paper, an\r\nagricultural college, the department of agriculture, or in some favored\r\ndistricts by consulting the local county \"agent.\" Washington had no such\r\nrecourse. There was not an agricultural college or agricultural paper in\r\nthe whole country; the department of agriculture was not created until\r\nnear the end of the next century; county \"agents\" were as unthought of\r\nas automobiles or electric lights; there was not a scientific farmer in\r\nAmerica; even the Philadelphia Society for the Promotion of Agriculture\r\nwas not founded until 1785. In his later years our Farmer could and did\r\nwrite to such foreign specialists as Arthur Young and Sir John Sinclair,\r\nbut they were Englishmen unfamiliar with American soils and climate and\r\ncould rarely give a weighty answer propounded to them by an American. If\r\nWashington wished to know a thing about practical farming, he usually\r\nhad to find it out for himself.\r\n\r\nThis state of affairs accounts for his performing some experiments that\r\nseem absurd. Thus in the fall of 1764 we find him sowing \"a few Oats to\r\nsee if they would stand the winter.\" Any country boy of to-day could\r\ntell him that ordinary oats sown under such conditions in the latitude\r\nof Mount Vernon would winter kill too badly to be of much use, but\r\nWashington could not know it till he had tried.\r\n\r\nIn another category was his experiment in March, 1760, with lucerne.\r\nLucerne is alfalfa. It will probably be news to most readers that\r\nalfalfa--the wonderful forage crop of the West, the producer of more\r\ngold than all the mines of the Klondike--was in use so long ago, for the\r\nimpression is pretty general that it is comparatively new; the fact is\r\nthat it is older than the Christian era and that the name alfalfa comes\r\nfrom the Arabic and means \"the best crop.\" Evidently our Farmer had been\r\nreading on the subject, for in his diary he quotes what \"Tull speaking\r\nof lucerne, says.\" He tried out the plant on this and several other\r\noccasions and had a considerable field of it in 1798. His success was\r\nnot large with it at any time, for the Mount Vernon soil was not\r\nnaturally suited to alfalfa, which thrives best in a dry and pervious\r\nsubsoil containing plenty of lime, but the experiment was certainly\r\nworth trying.\r\n\r\nIn this same year, 1760, we find him sowing clover, rye, grass, hope,\r\ntrefoil, timothy, spelt, which was a species of wheat, and various other\r\ngrasses and vegetables, most of them to all intents and purposes unknown\r\nto the Virginia agriculture of that day.\r\n\r\nHe also recorded an interesting experiment with fertilizer. April 14,\r\n1760, he writes in his diary:\r\n\r\n\"Mixed my composts in a box with the apartments in the following\r\nmanner, viz. No. 1 is three pecks of earth brought from below the hill\r\nout of the 46 acre field without any mixture. In No. 2 is two pecks of\r\nsand earth and one of marle taken out of the said field, which marle\r\nseemed a little inclined to sand. 3 has 2 pecks of sd. earth and 1 of\r\nriver sand.\r\n\r\n\"4 has a peck of Horse Dung\r\n\r\n\"5 has mud taken out of the creek\r\n\r\n\"6 has cow dung\r\n\r\n\"7 has marle from the Gulleys on the hillside, wch. seem'd to be purer\r\nthan the other\r\n\r\n\"8 sheep dung\r\n\r\n\"9 Black mould from the Gulleys on the hill side, wch. seem'd to be\r\npurer than the other\r\n\r\n\"10 Clay got just below the garden\r\n\r\n\"All mixed with the same quantity and sort of earth in the most\r\neffective manner by reducing the whole to a tolerable degree of fineness\r\nand rubbing them well together on a cloth. In each of these divisions\r\nwere planted three grains of wheat, 3 of oats, and as many of barley,\r\nall of equal distances in Rows and of equal depth done by a machine made\r\nfor the purpose. The wheat rows are next the numbered side, the oats in\r\nthe middle, and the barley on the side next the upper part of the\r\nGarden. Two or three hours after sowing in this manner, and about an\r\nhour before sunset I watered them all equally alike with water that had\r\nbeen standing in a tub abt two hours exposed to the sun.\"\r\n\r\nThree weeks later he inspected the boxes and concluded that Nos. 8 and 9\r\ngave the best results.\r\n\r\nThe plows of the period were cumbersome and did their work poorly.\r\nConsequently in March, 1760, Washington \"Fitted a two Eyed Plow instead\r\nof a Duck Bill Plow\", and tried it out, using his carriage horses in the\r\nwork. But this new model proved upon the whole a failure and a little\r\nlater he \"Spent the greater part of the day in making a new plow of my\r\nown Invention.\" Next day he set the new plow to work \"and found She\r\nanswerd very well.\"\r\n\r\nA little later he \"got a new harrow made of smaller and closer teethings\r\nfor harrowing in grain--the other being more proper for preparing the\r\nground for sowing.\"\r\n\r\nMuch of his attention in the next few years was devoted to wheat\r\ngrowing, for, as already related, he soon decided gradually to\r\ndiscontinue tobacco and it was imperative for him to discover some\r\nother money crop to take its place. We find him steeping his seed wheat\r\nin brine and alum to prevent smut and he also tried other experiments to\r\nprotect his grain from the Hessian fly and rust. Noticing how the\r\nfreezing and thawing of the ground in spring often injured the wheat by\r\nlifting it out of the ground, he adopted the practice of running a heavy\r\nroller over the wheat in order to get the roots back into the ground and\r\nhe was confident that when the operation was performed at the proper\r\ntime, that is when the ground was soft and the roots were still alive,\r\nit was productive of good results.\r\n\r\nIn June, 1763, he \"dug up abt. a load of Marle to spread over Wheat Land\r\nfor experiment.\" In 1768 he came to the conclusion that most farmers\r\nbegan to cut their wheat too late, for of course cradling was a slow\r\nprocess--scarcely four acres per day per cradler--and if the acreage was\r\nlarge several days must elapse before the last of the grain could be\r\ncut, with the result that some of it became so ripe that many of the\r\nkernels were shattered out and lost before the straw could be got to the\r\nthreshing floor. By careful experiments he determined that the grain\r\nwould not lose perceptibly in size and weight if the wheat were cut\r\ncomparatively green. In wheat-growing communities the discussion as to\r\nthis question still rages--extremists on one side will not cut their\r\nwheat till it is dead ripe, while those on the other begin to harvest it\r\nwhen it is almost sea-green.\r\n\r\nIn 1763 Washington entered into an agreement with John Carlyle and\r\nRobert Adams of Alexandria to sell to them all the wheat he would have\r\nto dispose of in the next seven years. The price was to be three\r\nshillings and nine pence per bushel, that is, about ninety-one cents.\r\nThis would not be far from the average price of wheat to-day, but, on\r\nthe one side, we should bear in mind that ninety-one cents then had much\r\ngreater purchasing power than now, so that the price was really much\r\ngreater, and, on the other, that the cost of raising wheat was larger\r\nthen, owing to lack of self-binders, threshing machines and other\r\nlabor-saving devices.\r\n\r\nThe wheat thus sold by Washington was to be delivered at the wharf at\r\nAlexandria or beside a boat or flat on Four Mile Run Creek. The delivery\r\nfor 1764 was 257-1/2 bushels; for 1765, 1,112-3/4 bushels; for 1766,\r\n2,331-1/2 bushels; for 1767--a bad year--1,293-1/2 bushels; for 1768,\r\n4,994-1/2 bushels of wheat and 4,304-1/2 bushels of corn; for 1769,\r\n6,241-1/2 bushels of wheat.\r\n\r\nThereafter he ground a good part of his wheat and sold the flour. He\r\nowned three mills, one in western Pennsylvania, already referred to, a\r\nsecond on Four Mile Run near Alexandria, and a third on the Mount Vernon\r\nestate. This last mill had been in operation since his father's day. It\r\nwas situated near the mouth of the stream known as Dogue Run, which was\r\nnot very well suited for the purpose as it ran from the extreme of low\r\nwater in summer to violent floods in winter and spring. Thus his miller,\r\nWilliam A. Poole, in a letter that wins the sweepstakes in phonetic\r\nspelling, complains in 1757 that he has been able to grind but little\r\nbecause \"She fails by want of Water.\" At other times the Master sallies\r\nout in the rain with rescue crews to save the mill from floods and more\r\nthan once the \"tumbling dam\" goes by the board in spite of all efforts.\r\nThe lack of water was partly remedied in 1771 by turning the water of\r\nPiney Branch into the Run, and about the same time a new and better mill\r\nwas erected, while in 1797 further improvements were made. During the\r\nwhole period flatboats and small schooners could come to the wharf to\r\ntake away the flour. Corn and other grains were ground, as well as\r\nwheat, and the mill had considerable neighborhood custom, the toll\r\nexacted being one-eighth. Only a few stones sticking in a bank now\r\nremain of the mill.\r\n\r\nWashington divided his flour into superfine, fine, middlings and ship\r\nstuff. It was put into barrels manufactured by the plantation coopers\r\nand much of it ultimately found its way to the West India market. A\r\ntradition--much quoted--has it that barrels marked \"George Washington,\r\nMount Vernon,\" were accepted in the islands without any inspection, but\r\nMr. J.M. Toner, one of the closest students of Washington's career,\r\ncontended that this was a mistake and pointed to the fact that the\r\nVirginia law provided for the inspection of all flour before it was\r\nexported and the placing of a brand on each barrel. However this may be,\r\nwe have Washington's own word for it, that his flour was as good in\r\nquality as any manufactured in America--and he was no boaster.\r\n\r\n[ILLUSTRATION: Dogue Run below the Site of the Mill]\r\n\r\n[ILLUSTRATION: On the Road to the Mill and Pohick Church]\r\n\r\nThat his flour was so good was in large measure due to the excellent\r\nquality of the wheat from which it was made. By careful attention to his\r\nseed and to cultivation he succeeded in raising grain that often\r\nweighed upward of sixty pounds to the bushel. After the Revolution he\r\nwrote: \"No wheat that has ever yet fallen under my observation exceeds\r\nthe wheat which some years ago I cultivated extensively.\"\r\n\r\nHis idea of good cultivation in these years was to let his fields lie\r\nfallow at certain intervals, though he also made use of manure, marl,\r\netc., and in 1772 tried the experiment of sowing two bushels of salt per\r\nacre upon fallow ground, dividing the plot up into strips eight feet in\r\nwidth and sowing the alternate strips in order that he might be able to\r\ndetermine results.\r\n\r\nHe imported from England an improved Rotheran or patent plow, and,\r\nhaving noticed in an agricultural work mention of a machine capable of\r\npulling up two or three hundred stumps per day, he expressed a desire\r\nfor one, saying: \"If the accounts are not greatly exaggerated, such\r\npowerful assistance must be of vast utility in many parts of this wooden\r\ncountry, where it is impossible for our force (and laborers are not to\r\nbe hired here), between the finishing of one crop and preparations for\r\nanother, to clear ground fast enough to afford the proper changes,\r\neither in the planting or farming business.\"\r\n\r\nThese were his golden days. He was not so rich as he was later nor so\r\nfamous, but he was strong and well and young, he had abundant friends,\r\nand his neighbors thought well enough of him to send him to the\r\nBurgesses and to make him a vestryman of old Pohick Church; if he felt\r\nthe need of recreation he went fishing or fox-hunting or attended a\r\nhorse race or played a game of cards with his friends, and he had few\r\nthings to trouble him seriously. But fussy kings and ministers overseas\r\nwere meddling with the liberties of subjects and were creating a\r\nsituation out of which was to come a mighty burden--a burden so\r\nAtalantean that it would have frightened most men, but one that he was\r\nbrave enough and strong enough to shoulder and with it march down to\r\nimmortality.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VIII\r\n\r\n\r\nCONSERVING THE SOIL\r\n\r\nThe Revolution rudely interrupted Washington's farming experiments, and\r\nfor eight long years he was so actively engaged in the grim business of\r\ncheckmating Howe and Clinton and Cornwallis that he could give little\r\ntime or thought to agriculture. For more than six years, in fact, he did\r\nnot once set foot upon his beloved fields and heard of his crops, his\r\nservants and his live stock only from family visitors to his camps or\r\nthrough the pages of his manager's letters.\r\n\r\nPeace at last brought him release. He had left Mount Vernon a simple\r\ncountry gentleman; he came back to it one of the most famous men in the\r\nworld. He wasted no time in contemplating his laurels, but at once threw\r\nhimself with renewed enthusiasm into his old occupation. His observation\r\nof northern agriculture and conversations with other farmers had\r\nbroadened his views and he was more than ever progressive. He was now\r\nthoroughly convinced of the great desirability of grass and stock for\r\nconserving the soil and he was also wide awake to the need of better\r\ntools and methods and wished to make his estate beautiful as well\r\nas useful.\r\n\r\nMuch of his energy in 1784-85 was devoted to rebuilding his house and\r\nimproving his grounds, and to his trip to his Ohio lands--all of which\r\nare described elsewhere. No diary exists for 1784 except that of the\r\ntrip to the Ohio, but from the diary of 1785 we learn that he found time\r\nto experiment with plaster of Paris and powdered stone as fertilizers,\r\nto sow clover, orchard grass, guinea grass and peas and to borrow a scow\r\nwith which to raise rich mud from the bed of the Potomac.\r\n\r\nThe growing poverty of his soil, in fact, was a subject to which he gave\r\nmuch attention. He made use of manure when possible, but the supply of\r\nthis was limited and commercial fertilizers were unknown. As already\r\nindicated, he was beginning the use of clover and other grasses, but he\r\nwas anxious to build up the soil more rapidly and the Potomac muck\r\nseemed to him a possible answer to the problem. There was, as he said,\r\n\"an inexhaustible fund\" of it, but the task of getting it on the land\r\nwas a heavy one. Having heard of a horse-power dredge called the\r\n_Hippopotamus_ that was in use on the Delaware River, he made inquiries\r\nconcerning it but feared that it would not serve his purpose, as he\r\nwould have to go from one hundred to eight hundred or a thousand yards\r\nfrom high water-mark for the mud--too far out for a horse to be\r\navailable. Mechanical difficulties and the cost of getting up the mud\r\nproved too great for him--as they have proved too great even down to the\r\npresent--but he never gave up the idea and from time to time tried\r\nexperiments with small plots of ground that had been covered with the\r\nmud. His enthusiasm on the subject was so great that Noah Webster, of\r\ndictionary fame, who visited him in this period, says that the standing\r\ntoast at Mount Vernon was \"Success to the mud!\"\r\n\r\nEvery scientific agriculturist knows that erosion is one of the chief\r\ncauses of loss in soil fertility and that in the basins and deltas of\r\nstreams and rivers there is going to waste enough muck to make all of\r\nour land rich. But the cost of getting this fertility back to the soil\r\nhas thus far proved too great for us to undertake the task of\r\nrestoration. It is conceivable, however, that the time may come when we\r\nshall undertake the work in earnest and then the dream of Washington\r\nwill be realized.\r\n\r\nThe spring and summer of 1785 proved excessively dry, and the crops\r\nsuffered, as they always do in times of drought. The wheat yield was\r\npoor and chinch bugs attacked the corn in such myriads that our Farmer\r\nfound \"hundreds of them & their young under the blades and at the lower\r\njoints of the Stock.\" By the middle of August \"Nature had put on a\r\nmelancholy look.\" The corn was \"_fired_ in most places to the Ear, with\r\nlittle appearance of yielding if Rain should now come & a certainty of\r\nmaking nothing if it did not.\"\r\n\r\nLike millions of anxious farmers before and after him, he watched\r\neagerly for the rain that came not. He records in his diary that on\r\nAugust 17th a good deal of rain fell far up the river, but as for his\r\nfields--it tantalizingly passed by on the other side, and \"not enough\r\nfell here to wet a handkerchief.\" On the eighteenth, nineteenth and\r\ntwenty-second clouds and thunder and lightning again awakened hopes but\r\nonly slight sprinkles resulted. On the twenty-seventh nature at last\r\nrelented and, to his great satisfaction, there was a generous downpour.\r\n\r\nThe rain was beneficial to about a thousand grains of Cape of Good Hope\r\nwheat that Washington had just sown and by the thirty-first he was able\r\nto note that it was coming up. For several years thereafter he\r\nexperimented with this wheat. He found that it grew up very rank and\r\ntried cutting some of it back. But the variety was not well adapted to\r\nVirginia and ultimately he gave it up.\r\n\r\nIn this period he also tried Siberian wheat, put marl on sixteen square\r\nrods of meadow[4], plowed under rye, and experimented with oats,\r\ncarrots, Eastern Shore peas, supposed to be strengthening to land, also\r\nrib grass, burnet and various other things. He planted potatoes both\r\nwith and without manure and noted carefully the difference in yields. At\r\nthis time he favored planting corn in rows about ten feet apart, with\r\nrows of potatoes, carrots, or peas between. He noted down that his\r\nexperience showed that corn ought to be planted not later than May\r\n15th, preferably by the tenth or perhaps even as early as the first, in\r\nwhich his practice would not differ much from that of to-day. But he\r\ncame to an erroneous conclusion when he decided that wheat ought to be\r\nsown in August or at the latter end of July, for this was playing into\r\nthe hands of his enemy, the Hessian fly, which is particularly\r\ndestructive to early sown wheat. Later he seems to have changed his mind\r\non that point, for near the end of his life he instructed his manager to\r\nget the wheat in by September 10th. Another custom which he was\r\nadvocating was that of fall and winter plowing and he had as much of it\r\ndone as time and weather would permit. All of his experiments in this\r\nperiod were painstakingly set down and he even took the trouble in 1786\r\nto index his agricultural notes and observations for that year.\r\n\r\n[4] \"On sixteen square rod of ground in my lower pasture, I put 140\r\nBushels of what we call Marle viz on 4 of these, No. Wt. corner were\r\nplaced 50 bushels--on 4 others So. Wt. corner 30 bushels--on 4 others\r\nSo. Et. corner 40 bushels--and on the remaining 4-20 bushels. This Marle\r\nwas spread on the rods in these proportions--to try first whether what\r\nwe have denominated to be Marie possesses any virtue as manure--and\r\nsecondly--if it does, the quantity proper for an acre.\" His ultimate\r\nconclusion was that marl was of little benefit to land such as he owned\r\nat Mount Vernon.\r\n\r\nMany of his experiments were made in what he called his \"Botanical\r\nGarden,\" a plot of ground lying between the flower garden and the\r\nspinner's house. But he had experimental plots on most or all of his\r\nplantations, and each day as he made the rounds of his estate on\r\nhorseback he would examine how his plants were growing or would start\r\nnew experiments.\r\n\r\nThe record of failures is, of course, much greater than of successes,\r\nbut that is the experience of every scientific farmer or horticulturist\r\nwho ventures out of the beaten path. Even Burbank, the wizard, has his\r\nfailures--and many of them.\r\n\r\nOne of Washington's successes was what he called a \"barrel plough.\" At\r\nthat time all seed, such as corn, wheat and oats had to be sown or\r\ndropped by hand and then covered with a harrow or a hoe or something of\r\nthe kind. Washington tried to make a machine that would do the work more\r\nexpeditiously and succeeded, though it should be said that his plans\r\nwere not altogether original with him, as there was a plan for such a\r\nmachine in Duhamel and another was published by Arthur Young about this\r\ntime in the _Annals of Agriculture_, which Washington was now perusing\r\nwith much attention. Richard Peters also sent yet another plan.\r\n\r\nWashington's drill, as we should call it to-day, consisted of a barrel\r\nor hollow cylinder of wood mounted upon a wheeled plow and so arranged\r\nthat as the plow moved forward the barrel turned. In the barrel, holes\r\nwere cut or burnt through which the corn or other seed could drop into\r\ntubes that ran down to the ground. By decreasing or increasing the\r\nnumber of holes the grain could be planted thicker or thinner as\r\ndesired. To prevent the holes from choking up he found it expedient to\r\nmake them larger on the outside than on the inside, and he also found\r\nthat the machine worked better if the barrel was not kept too full of\r\nseed. Behind the drills ran a light harrow or drag which covered the\r\nseed, though in rough ground it was necessary to have a man follow after\r\nwith a hoe to assist the process. A string was fastened to this harrow\r\nby which it could be lifted around when turning at the ends of the rows,\r\nthe drill itself being managed by a pair of handles.\r\n\r\nWashington wrote to a friend that the drill would not \"work to good\r\neffect in land that is very full either of stumps, stones, or large\r\nclods; but, where the ground is tolerably free from these and in good\r\ntilth, and particularly in light land, I am certain you will find it\r\nequal to your most sanguine expectation, for Indian corn, wheat, barley,\r\npease, or any other tolerably round grain, that you may wish to sow or\r\nplant in this manner. I have sown oats very well with it, which is among\r\nthe most inconvenient and unfit grains for this machine.... A small bag,\r\ncontaining about a peck of the seed you are sowing, is hung to the nails\r\non the right handle, and with a small tin cup the barrel is replenished\r\nwith convenience, whenever it is necessary, without loss of time, or\r\nwaiting to come up with the seed-bag at the end of the row.\"\r\n\r\nAs Washington says, the drill would probably work well under ideal\r\nconditions, but there were features of it that would incline, I have no\r\ndoubt, to make its operator swear at times. There was a leather band\r\nthat ran about the barrel with holes corresponding to those in the\r\nbarrel, the purpose of the band being to prevent the seeds issuing out\r\nof more than one hole at the same time. This band had to be \"slackened\r\nor braced\" according to the influence of the atmosphere upon the\r\nleather, and sometimes the holes in the band tended to gape and admit\r\nseed between the band and the barrel, in which case Washington found it\r\nexpedient to rivet \"a piece of sheet tin, copper, or brass, the width of\r\nthe band, and about four inches long, with a hole through it, the size\r\nof the one in the leather.\"\r\n\r\nWashington was, however, very proud of the drill, and it must have\r\nworked fairly well, for he was not the man to continue to use a\r\nworthless implement simply because he had made it. He even used it to\r\nsow very small seed. In the summer of 1786 he records: \"Having fixed a\r\nRoller to the tale of my drill plow, & a brush between it and the\r\nbarrel, I sent it to Muddy Hole & sowed turnips in the intervals\r\nof corn[5].\"\r\n\r\n[5] Another passage from his papers in which he mentions using his drill\r\nplow is also illustrative of the emphasis he placed upon having the seed\r\nbed for a crop properly prepared. The passage describes his sowing some\r\nspring wheat and is as follows: \"12th [of April, 1785].--Sowed sixteen\r\nacres of Siberian wheat, with eighteen quarts, in rows between corn,\r\neight feet apart. This ground had been prepared in the following manner:\r\n1. A single furrow; 2. another in the same to deepen it; 3. four furrows\r\nto throw the earth back into the two first, which made ridges of five\r\nfurrows. These, being done some time ago, and the sowing retarded by\r\nfrequent rains, had got hard; therefore, 4. before the seed was sown,\r\nthese ridges were split again by running twice in the middle of them,\r\nboth times in the same furrow; 5. after which the ridges were harrowed;\r\nand, 6. where the ground was lumpy, run a spiked roller with a harrow at\r\nthe tail of it, which was found very efficacious in breaking the clods\r\nand pulverizing the earth, and would have done it perfectly, if there\r\nhad not been too much moisture remaining from the late rains. After\r\nthis, harrowing and rolling were necessary, the wheat was sown with the\r\ndrill plough on the reduced ridges eight feet apart, as above mentioned,\r\nand harrowed in with the small harrow belonging to the plough. But it\r\nshould have been observed, that, after the ridges were split by the\r\nmiddle double furrows, and before they were closed again by the harrow,\r\na little manure was sprinkled in.\"\r\n\r\nNo man better understood the value of good clean seed than did he, but\r\nhe had much trouble in satisfying his desires in this respect. Often the\r\nseed he bought was foul with weed seeds, and at other times it would not\r\ngrow at all. Once he mentions having set the women and \"weak hands\" to\r\nwork picking wild onions out of some Eastern Shore oats that he\r\nhad bought.\r\n\r\nHe advocated planting the largest and finest potatoes instead of the\r\nlittle ones, as some farmers out of false ideas of economy still make\r\nthe mistake of doing, and he followed the same principle that \"the best\r\nwill produce the best\" in selecting all seed.\r\n\r\nHe also appreciated the importance of getting just the right stand of\r\ngrain--not too many plants and not too few--upon his fields and\r\nconducted investigations along this line. He laboriously calculated the\r\nnumber of seed in a pound Troy of various seeds and ascertained, for\r\nexample, that the number of red clover was 71,000, of timothy 298,000,\r\nof \"New River Grass\" 844,800 and of barley 8,925. Knowing these facts,\r\nhe was able to calculate how much ought to be sowed of a given seed\r\nto the acre.\r\n\r\nThe spectacle of the former Commander of the Armies of a Continent\r\nengaging in such minute labor is ridiculous or sublime, according to the\r\nviewpoint!\r\n\r\nIn the spring of the year that he helped to frame the Federal\r\nConstitution he \"Sowed the squares No. 2 & 4 at this place [Dogue Run]\r\nwith oats in the following manner--viz--the East half of No. 2 with\r\nhalf a Bushel of Oats from George Town--and the west half with a Bushel\r\nof Poland Oats--The east half of No. 4 with half a bushel of the Poland\r\nOats and the west half with a bushel of the George Town Oats. The\r\nobjects, and design of this experiment, was to ascertn. 3 things--1st.\r\nwhich of these two kinds of Oats were best the George Town (which was a\r\ngood kind of the common Oats)--2d. whether two or four bushels to the\r\nAcre was best--and 3d. the difference between ground dunged at the Rate\r\nof 5 load or 200 bushels to the Acre and ground undunged.\"\r\n\r\nThis experiment is typical of a great many others and it resulted, of\r\ncourse, in better yields on the manured ground and showed that two\r\nbushels of seed were preferable to four. But if he ever set down the\r\nresult of the experiment as regards the varieties, the passage has\r\nescaped me.\r\n\r\nWhile at Fredericksburg this year visiting his mother and his sister\r\nBetty Lewis he learned of an interesting method of raising potatoes\r\nunder straw and wrote down the details in his diary. A little later when\r\nattending the Federal Convention he kept his eyes and ears open for\r\nagricultural information. He learned how the Pennsylvanians cultivated\r\nbuckwheat and visited the farm of a certain Jones, who was getting good\r\nresults from the use of plaster of Paris. With his usual interest in\r\nlabor-saving machinery he inspected at Benjamin Franklin's a sort of\r\nironing machine called a mangle, \"well calculated,\" he thought, \"for\r\nTable cloths & such articles as have not pleats & irregular foldings &\r\nwould be very useful in large families.\"\r\n\r\nThis year he had in wheat seven hundred acres, in grass five hundred\r\neighty acres, in oats four hundred acres, in corn seven hundred acres,\r\nwith several hundred more in buckwheat, barley, potatoes, peas, beans\r\nand turnips.\r\n\r\nIn 1788 he raised one thousand eighty-eight bushels of potatoes on one\r\nplantation, but they were not dug till December and in consequence some\r\nwere badly injured by the frost. An experiment that year was one of\r\ntransplanting carrots between rows of corn and it was not successful.\r\n\r\nHe worked hard in these years, but, as many another industrious farmer\r\nhas discovered, he found that he could do little unless nature smiled\r\nand fickle nature persisted in frowning. In 1785 the rain seemed to\r\nforget how to fall, and in 1786 how to stop falling. Some crops failed\r\nor were very short and soon he was so hard up that he was anxious to\r\nsell some lands or negroes to meet debts coming due. In February, 1786,\r\nin sending fifteen guineas to his mother, he wrote:\r\n\r\n\"I have now demands upon me for more than £500, three hundred and forty\r\nodd of which is due for the tax of 1786; and I know not where or when I\r\nshall receive one shilling with which to pay it. In the last two years I\r\nmade no crops. In the first I was obliged to buy corn, and this year\r\nhave none to sell, and my wheat is so bad I can neither eat it myself\r\nnor sell it to others, and tobacco I make none. Those who owe me money\r\ncannot or will not pay it without suits, and to sue is to do nothing;\r\nwhilst my expenses, not from any extravagance, or an inclination on my\r\npart to live splendidly, but for the absolute support of my family and\r\nthe visitors who are constantly here, are exceedingly high.\"\r\n\r\nTo bad crops were joined bad conditions throughout the country\r\ngenerally. The government of the Confederation was dying of inanition,\r\nAmerica was flooded with depreciated currency, both state and\r\nContinental. In western Massachusetts a rebellion broke out, the rebels\r\nbeing largely discouraged debtors. A state of chaos seemed imminent and\r\nwould have resulted had not the Federal Convention, of which Washington\r\nwas a member, created a new government. Ultimately this government\r\nbrought order and financial stability, but all this took time and\r\nWashington was so financially embarrassed in 1789 when he traveled to\r\nNew York to be inaugurated President that he had to borrow money to pay\r\nthe expenses of the journey.\r\n\r\nAfter having set the wheels of government in motion he made an extended\r\ntrip through New England and whenever public festivities would permit he\r\nexamined into New England farm methods and took copious notes. On the\r\nfirst day up from New York he saw good crops of corn mixed with pumpkins\r\nand met four droves of beef cattle, \"some of which were very fine--also\r\na Flock of Sheep.... We scarcely passed a farm house that did not abd.\r\nin Geese.\" His judgment of New England stock was that the cattle were\r\n\"of a good quality and their hogs large, but rather long legged.\" The\r\nshingle roofs, stone and brick chimneys, stone fences and cider making\r\nall attracted his attention. The fact that wheat in that section\r\nproduced an average of fifteen bushels per acre and often twenty or\r\ntwenty-five was duly noted. On the whole he seems to have considered\r\nthe tour enjoyable and profitable in spite of the fact that on his\r\nreturn through Connecticut the law against Sabbath traveling compelled\r\nhim to remain over Sunday at Perkins' Tavern and to attend church twice,\r\nwhere he \"heard very lame discourses from a Mr. Pond.\"\r\n\r\nAbout 1785 Washington had begun a correspondence with Arthur Young and\r\nalso began to read his periodical called the _Annals of Agriculture_.\r\nThe _Annals_ convinced him more than ever of the superiority of the\r\nEnglish system of husbandry and not only gave him the idea for some of\r\nthe experiments that have been mentioned, but also made him very\r\ndesirous of adopting a regular and systematic course of cropping in\r\norder to conserve his soil. Taking advantage of an offer made by Young,\r\nhe ordered (August 6, 1786) through him English plows, cabbage, turnip,\r\nsainfoin, rye-grass and hop clover seed and eight bushels of winter\r\nvetches; also some months later, velvet wheat, field beans, spring\r\nbarley, oats and more sainfoin seed. He furthermore expressed a wish for\r\n\"a plan of the most complete and useful farmyard, for farms of about 500\r\nacres. In this I mean to comprehend the barn, and every appurtenance\r\nwhich ought to be annexed to the yard.\"\r\n\r\nYoung was as good as his word. Although English law forbade the\r\nexportation of some of these things--a fact of which Washington was not\r\naware--he and Sir John Sinclair prevailed upon Lord Grenville to issue a\r\nspecial permit and in due course everything reached Mount Vernon. Part\r\nof the seeds were somewhat injured by being put into the hold of the\r\nvessel that brought them over, with the result that they overheated--a\r\nthing that troubled Washington whenever he imported seeds--but on the\r\nwhole the consignment was in fair order, and our Farmer was\r\nduly grateful.\r\n\r\nThe plows appeared excessively heavy to the Virginians who looked them\r\nover, but a trial showed that they worked \"exceedingly well.\"\r\n\r\nTo Young's plan for a barn and barnyard Washington made some additions\r\nand constructed the barn upon Union Farm, building it of bricks that\r\nwere made on the estate. He later expressed a belief that it was \"the\r\nlargest and most convenient one in this country.\" It has now disappeared\r\nalmost utterly, but Young's plan was subsequently engraved in\r\nthe _Annals_.\r\n\r\nIn return for the exertions of Young and Sinclair in his behalf\r\nWashington sent over some American products and also took pains to\r\ncollect information for them as to the state of American agriculture.\r\nHis letters show an almost pathetic eagerness to please these good\r\nfriends and it is evident that in his farming operations he regarded\r\nhimself as one of Young's disciples. He was no egotist who believed that\r\nbecause he had been a successful soldier and was now President of the\r\nUnited States he could not learn anything from a specialist. The trait\r\nwas most commendable and one that is sadly lacking in many of his\r\ncountrymen, some of whom take pride in declaring that \"these here\r\nscientific fellers caint tell me nothin' about raisin' corn!\"\r\n\r\nYoung and Sir John Sinclair were by no means his only agricultural\r\ncorrespondents. Even Noah Webster dropped his legal and philological\r\nwork long enough in 1790 to propound a theory so startlingly modern in\r\nits viewpoint that it is worthy of reproduction. Said he:\r\n\r\n\"While therefore I allow, in its full extent, the value of stable\r\nmanure, marl, plaster of Paris, lime, ashes, sea-weed, sea-shells &\r\nsalt, in enriching land, I believe none of them are absolutely\r\nnecessary, but that nature has provided an inexhaustible store of\r\nmanure, which is equally accessible to the rich and the poor, & which\r\nmay be collected & applied to land with very little labor and expense.\r\nThis store is the _atmosphere_, & the process by which the fertilizing\r\nsubstance may be obtained is vegetation.\"\r\n\r\nHe added that such crops as oats, peas, beans and buckwheat should be\r\nraised and plowed under to rot and that land should never be left bare.\r\nAs one peruses the letter he recalls that scientists of to-day tell us\r\nthat the air is largely made up of nitrogen, that plants are able to\r\n\"fix it,\" and he half expects to find Webster advocating \"soil\r\ninnoculation\" and speaking of \"nodules\" and \"bacteria.\"\r\n\r\nThroughout the period after the Revolution our Farmer's one greatest\r\nconcern was to conserve and restore his land. When looking for a new\r\nmanager he once wrote that the man must be, \"above all, Midas like, one\r\nwho can convert everything he touches into manure, as the first\r\ntransmutation toward gold; in a word, one who can bring worn-out and\r\ngullied lands into good tilth in the shortest time.\" He saved manure as\r\nif it were already so much gold and hoped with its use and with\r\njudicious rotation of crops to accomplish his object. \"Unless some such\r\npractice as this prevails,\" he wrote in 1794, \"my fields will be growing\r\nworse and worse every year, until the Crops will not defray the expense\r\nof the culture of them.\"\r\n\r\nHe drew up elaborate plans for the rotation of crops on his different\r\nfarms. Not content with one plan, he often drew up several alternatives;\r\ncalculated the probable financial returns from each, allowing for the\r\ncost of seed, cultivation and other expenses, and commented upon the\r\nrespective advantages from every point of view of the various plans. The\r\nlabor involved in such work was very great, but Washington was no\r\nshirker. He was always up before sunrise, both in winter and summer, and\r\nseems to have been so constituted that he was most contented when he had\r\nsomething to do. Perhaps if he had had to engage in hard manual toil\r\nevery day he would have had less inclination for such employment, but he\r\nworked with his own hands only intermittently, devoting his time mostly\r\nto planning and oversight.\r\n\r\nOne such plan for Dogue Run Farm is given on the next page. To\r\nunderstand it the reader should bear in mind that the farm contained\r\nfive hundred twenty-five arable acres divided into seven fields, each of\r\nwhich contained about seventy-five acres.\r\n\r\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n No. of |        |        |        |        |        |        |        |\r\n Fields |  1793  |  1794  |  1795  |  1796  |  1797  |  1798  |  1799  |\r\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n        |  Corn  |        |Buckwheat        | Clover | Clover | Clover |\r\n   3    |   and  |  Wheat |   for  |  Wheat |   or   |   or   |   or   |\r\n        |Potatoes|        | Manure |        |  Grass |  Grass |  Grass |\r\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n        | Clover |  Corn  |        |Buckwheat        | Clover | Clover |\r\n   4    |   or   |   and  |  Wheat |   for  |  Wheat |   or   |   or   |\r\n        |  Grass |Potatoes|        | Manure |        |  Grass |  Grass |\r\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n        | Clover | Clover |  Corn  |        |Buckwheat        | Clover |\r\n   5    |   or   |   or   |   and  |  Wheat |   for  |  Wheat |   or   |\r\n        |  Grass |  Grass |Potatoes|        | Manure |        |  Grass |\r\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n        | Clover | Clover | Clover |  Corn  |        |Buckwheat        |\r\n   6    |   or   |   or   |   or   |   and  |  Wheat |   for  |  Wheat |\r\n        |  Grass |  Grass |  Grass |Potatoes|        | Manure |        |\r\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n        |        | Clover | Clover | Clover |  Corn  |        |Buckwheat\r\n   7    |  Wheat |   or   |   or   |   or   |   and  |  Wheat |   for  |\r\n        |        |  Grass |  Grass |  Grass |Potatoes|        | Manure |\r\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n        |Buckwheat        | Clover | Clover | Clover |  Corn  |        |\r\n   1    |   for  |  Wheat |   or   |   or   |   or   |   and  |  Wheat |\r\n        | Manure |        |  Grass |  Grass |  Grass |Potatoes|        |\r\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n        |        |Buckwheat        | Clover | Clover | Clover |  Cornr |\r\n   2    |  Wheat |   for  |  Wheat |   or   |   or   |   or   |   and  |\r\n        |        | Manure |        |  Grass |  Grass |  Grass |Potatoes|\r\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\nOf this rotation he noted that it \"favors the land\r\nvery much; inasmuch as there are but three corn\r\ncrops [i.e. grain crops] taken in seven years from\r\nany field, & the first of the wheat crops is followed\r\nby a Buck Wheat manure for the second Wheat\r\nCrop, wch. is to succeed it; & which by being laid\r\nto Clover or Grass & continued therein three years\r\nwill a ford much Mowing or Grassing, according as\r\nthe Seasons happen to be, besides being a restoration\r\nto the Soil--But the produce of the sale of the\r\nCrops is small, unless encreased by the improving\r\nstate of the fields. Nor will the Grain for the use of\r\nthe Farm be adequate to the consumption of it in\r\nthis Course, and this is an essential object to attend to.\"\r\n\r\nIn a second table he estimated the amount of work that would be required\r\neach year to carry out this plan of rotation, assuming that one plow\r\nwould break up three-fourths of an acre per day. This amount is hardly\r\nhalf what an energetic farmer with a good team of horses will now turn\r\nover in a day with an ordinary walking plow, but the negro farmer\r\nlacked ambition, the plows were cumbersome, and much of the work was\r\ndone with plodding oxen. The table follows:\r\n\r\n[ILLUSTRATION (TABLE): PLANTING CHART]\r\n\r\nHe estimated that seventy-five acres of corn would yield, at twelve and\r\na half bushels per acre, 937-1/2 bushels, worth at two shillings and\r\nsixpence per bushel £117.3.9. In this field potatoes would be planted\r\nbetween the rows of corn and would produce, at twelve and a half bushels\r\nper acre, 937-1/2 bushels, worth at one shilling per bushel £46.17.6.\r\nTwo fields in wheat, a total of one hundred fifty acres, at ten bushels\r\nper acre, would yield one thousand five hundred bushels, worth at five\r\nshillings per bushel three hundred seventy-five pounds. Three fields in\r\nclover and grass and the field of buckwheat to be turned under for\r\nmanure would yield no money return. In other words the whole farm would\r\nproduce three thousand three hundred seventy-five bushels of grain and\r\npotatoes worth a total of £539.1.3.\r\n\r\nA second alternative plan would yield crops worth £614.1.3; a third,\r\nabout the same; a fourth, £689.1.3; a fifth, providing for two hundred\r\ntwenty-five acres of wheat, £801.11.0; a sixth, £764. Number five would\r\nbe most productive, but he noted that it would seriously reduce the\r\nland. Number six would be \"the 2d. most productive Rotation, but the\r\nfields receive no rest,\" as it provided for neither grass nor pasture,\r\nwhile the plowing required would exceed that of any of the other plans\r\nby two hundred eighty days.\r\n\r\nOn a small scale he tried growing cotton, Botany Bay grass, hemp, white\r\nnankeen grass and various other products. He experimented with deep soil\r\nplowing by running twice in the same furrow and also cultivated some\r\nwheat that had been drilled in rows instead of broadcasted.\r\n\r\nIn 1793 he built a new sixteen-sided barn on the\r\n\r\n[ILLUSTRATION: Part of Washington's Plan for His Sixteen-Sided Barn]\r\n\r\nDogue Run Farm. The plan of this barn, drawn by Washington himself, is\r\nstill preserved and is reproduced herewith. He calculated that one\r\nhundred and forty thousand bricks would be required for it and these\r\nwere made and burnt upon the estate. The barn was particularly notable\r\nfor a threshing floor thirty feet square, with interstices one and a\r\nhalf inches wide left between the floor boards so that the grain when\r\ntrodden out by horses or beat out with flails would fall through to the\r\nfloor below, leaving the straw above.\r\n\r\nThis floor was to furnish an illustration of what Washington called \"the\r\nalmost impossibility of putting the overseers of this country out of the\r\ntrack they have been accustomed to walk in. I have one of the most\r\nconvenient barns in this or perhaps any other country, where thirty\r\nhands may with great ease be employed in threshing. Half the wheat of\r\nthe farm was actually stowed in this barn in the straw by my order, for\r\nthreshing; notwithstanding, when I came home about the middle of\r\nSeptember, I found a treading yard not thirty feet from the barn-door,\r\nthe wheat again brought out of the barn, and horses treading it out in\r\nan open exposure, liable to the vicissitudes of the weather.\"\r\n\r\nI think we may safely conclude that this was one of those rare\r\noccasions when George lost his temper and \"went up in the air!\"\r\n\r\nUnder any conditions treading or flailing out wheat was a slow and\r\nunsatisfactory process and, as Washington grew great quantities of this\r\ngrain, he was alert for a better method. We know that he made inquiries\r\nof Arthur Young concerning a threshing machine invented by a certain\r\nWinlaw and pictured and described in volume six of the _Annals_, and in\r\n1790 he watched the operation of Baron Poelnitz's mill on the Winlaw\r\nmodel near New York City. This mill was operated by two men and was\r\ncapable of threshing about two bushels of wheat per hour--pretty slow\r\nwork as compared with that of a modern thresher. And the grain had to be\r\nwinnowed, or passed through a fan afterward to separate it from\r\nthe chaff.\r\n\r\nFinally in 1797 he erected a machine on plans evolved by William Booker,\r\nwho came to Mount Vernon and oversaw the construction. Next April he\r\nwrote to Booker that the machine \"has by no means answered your\r\nexpectations or mine,\" At first it threshed not quite fifty bushels per\r\nday, then fell to less than twenty-five, and ultimately got out of\r\norder before five hundred bushels had been threshed, though it had used\r\nup two bands costing between eight and ten pounds. Booker replied that\r\nhe had now greatly improved his invention and would come to Mount Vernon\r\nand make these additions, but whether or not he ever did so I have\r\nfailed to discover.\r\n\r\nBy 1793 the burden of the estate had become so heavy that Washington\r\ndecided to rent all of it except the Mansion House Farm and accordingly\r\nhe wrote to Arthur Young telling his desire in the hope that Englishmen\r\nmight be found to take it over. One man, Parkinson, of whom more\r\nhereafter, came to America and looked at one of the farms, but decided\r\nnot to rent it. Washington's elaborate description of his land in his\r\nletter to Young, with an accompanying map, forms one of our best sources\r\nof information regarding Mount Vernon, so that we may be grateful that\r\nhe had the intention even though nothing came of it. The whole of Mount\r\nVernon continued to be cultivated as before until the last year of his\r\nlife when he rented Dogue Run Farm to his nephew, Lawrence Lewis.\r\n\r\nAs a public man he was anxious to improve the general state of American\r\nagriculture and in his last annual message to Congress recommended the\r\nestablishment of a board of agriculture to collect and diffuse\r\ninformation and \"by premiums and small pecuniary aids to encourage and\r\nassist a spirit of discovery and improvement.\" In this recommendation\r\nthe example of the English Board of Agriculture and the influence of his\r\nfriend Arthur Young are discernible. It would have been well for the\r\ncountry if Congress had heeded the advice, but public opinion was not\r\nthen educated to the need of such a step and almost a century passed\r\nbefore anything of much importance was done by the national government\r\nto improve the state of American agriculture.\r\n\r\nIn farming as in politics Washington was no standpatter. Notwithstanding\r\nmany discouragements, he could not be kept from trying new things, and\r\nhe furnished his farms with every kind of improved tool and implement\r\ncalculated to do better work. At his death he owned not only threshing\r\nmachines and a Dutch fan, but a wheat drill, a corn drill, a machine for\r\ngathering clover seed and another for raking up wheat. Yet most of his\r\ncountrymen remained content to drop corn by hand, to broadcast their\r\nwheat, to tread out their grain and otherwise to follow methods as old\r\nas the days of Abel for at least another half century.\r\n\r\nHe was the first American conservationist. He realized that man owes a\r\nduty to the future just as he owes a debt to the past. He deplored the\r\nalready developing policy of robber exploitation by which our soil and\r\nforests have been despoiled, for he foresaw the bitter fruits which such\r\na policy must produce, and indeed was already producing on the fields of\r\nVirginia. He was no misanthropic cynic to exclaim, \"What has posterity\r\never done for us that we should concern ourselves for posterity?\" His\r\ncare for the lands of Mount Vernon was evidence of the God-given trait\r\nimbedded in the best of men to transmit unimpaired to future generations\r\nwhat has been handed down to them.\r\n\r\nHis agricultural career has its lessons for us, even though we should\r\nnot do well to follow some of his methods. The lessons lie rather in his\r\nconception of farming as an honorable occupation capable of being put on\r\na better and more scientific basis by the application of brains and\r\nintelligence; in his open-minded and progressive seeking after better\r\nways. Many of his experiments failed, it is true, but for his time he\r\nwas a great Farmer, just as he was a great Patriot, Soldier and\r\nStatesman. Patient, hard-working, methodical, willing to sacrifice his\r\nown interests to those of the general good, he was one of those men who\r\nhave helped raise mankind from the level of the brute and his whole\r\ncareer reflects credit upon human nature.\r\n\r\nPeace hath its victories no less renowned than war, and the picture of\r\nthe American Cincinnatus striving as earnestly on the green fields of\r\nMount Vernon as he did upon the scarlet ones of Monmouth and Brandywine,\r\nis one that the world can not afford to forget.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IX\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE STOCKMAN\r\n\r\nA various times in his career Washington raised deer, turkeys, hogs,\r\ncattle, geese, negroes and various other forms of live stock, but his\r\ngreatest interest seems to have been reserved for horses, sheep\r\nand mules.\r\n\r\nFrom his diaries and other papers that have come down to us it is easy\r\nto see that during his early married life he paid most attention to his\r\nhorses. In 1760 he kept a stallion both for his own mares and for those\r\nof his neighbors, and we find many entries concerning the animal.\r\nSuccessors were \"Leonidas,\" \"Samson,\" \"Steady,\" \"Traveller\" and\r\n\"Magnolia,\" the last a full-blooded Arabian and probably the finest\r\nbeast he ever owned. When away from home Washington now and then\r\ndirected the manager to advertise the animal then reigning or to exhibit\r\nhim in public places such as fairs. Mares brought to the stallion were\r\nkept upon pasture, and foal was guaranteed. Many times the General\r\ncomplained of the difficulty of collecting fees.\r\n\r\nDuring the Revolution he bought twenty-seven worn-out army mares for\r\nbreeding purposes and soon after he became President he purchased at\r\nLancaster, Pennsylvania, thirteen fine animals for the same use. These\r\nlast cost him a total of £317.17.6, the price of the highest being\r\n£25.7.6 and of the cheapest £22.10. These mares were unusually good\r\nanimals, as an ordinary beast would have cost only five or six pounds.\r\n\r\nIn November, 1785, he had on his various Mount Vernon farms a total of\r\none hundred thirty horses, including the Arabian already mentioned.\r\nAmong the twenty-one animals kept at the Mansion House were his old war\r\nhorses \"Nelson\" and \"Blewskin,\" who after bearing their master through\r\nthe smoke and dangers of many battles lived in peace to a ripe old age\r\non the green fields of Virginia.\r\n\r\nIn his last days he bought two of the easy-gaited animals known as\r\nNarragansetts, a breed, some readers will recall, described at some\r\nlength by Cooper in _The Last of the Mohicans._ A peculiarity of these\r\nbeasts was that they moved both legs on a side forward at the same time,\r\nthat is, they were pacers. Washington's two proved somewhat skittish,\r\nand one of them was responsible for the only fall from horseback that we\r\nhave any record of his receiving. In company with Major Lewis, Mr.\r\nPeake, young George Washington Custis and a groom he was returning in\r\nthe evening from Alexandria and dismounted for a few moments near a fire\r\non the roadside. When he attempted to mount again the horse sprang\r\nforward suddenly and threw him. The others jumped from their horses to\r\nassist him, but the old man got up quickly, brushed his clothes and\r\nexplained that he had been thrown only because he had not yet got\r\nseated. All the horses meanwhile had run away and the party started to\r\nwalk four miles home, but luckily some negroes along the road caught the\r\nfugitives and brought them back. Washington insisted upon mounting his\r\nanimal again and rode home without further incident. This episode\r\nhappened only a few weeks before his death.\r\n\r\nLike every farmer he found that his horses had a way of growing old.\r\nThose with which he had personal associations, like \"Blueskin\" and\r\n\"Nelson,\" he kept until they died of old age. With others he sometimes\r\nfollowed a different course. In 1792 we find his manager, Whiting,\r\nwriting: \"We have several Old Horses that are not worth keeping thro\r\nwinter. One at Ferry has not done one days work these 18 Months. 2 at\r\nMuddy hole one a horse with the Pole evil which I think will not get\r\nwell the other an Old Mare was not capable of work last summer. Likewise\r\nthe Horse called old Chatham and the Lame Horse that used to go in the\r\nWaggon now in a one horse Cart. If any thing could be Got for them it\r\nmight be well but they are not worth keeping after Christmas.\" No doubt\r\na sentimental person would say that Washington ought to have kept these\r\nold servants, but he had many other superannuated servants of the human\r\nkind upon his hands, so he replied that Whiting might dispose of the old\r\nhorses \"as you judge best for my interest.\"\r\n\r\nNow and then his horses met with accidents. Thus on February 22, 1760,\r\nhis horse \"Jolly\" got his right foreleg \"mashed to pieces,\" probably by\r\na falling limb. \"Did it up as well as I could this night.\" \"Saturday,\r\nFeb. 23d. Had the Horse Slung upon Canvas and his leg fresh set,\r\nfollowing Markleham's directions as well as I could.\" Two days later the\r\nhorse fell out of the sling and hurt himself so badly that he had to\r\nbe killed.\r\n\r\nOf Washington's skill as a trainer of horses his friend De Chastellux\r\nwrites thus: \"The weather being fair, on the 26th, I got on horseback,\r\nafter breakfasting with the general--he was so attentive as to give me\r\nthe horse he rode, the day of my arrival, which I had greatly\r\ncommended--I found him as good as he is handsome; but above all,\r\nperfectly well broke, and well trained, having a good mouth, easy in\r\nhand, and stopping short in a gallop without bearing the bit--I mention\r\nthese minute particulars, because it is the general himself who breaks\r\nall his own horses; and he is a very excellent and bold horseman,\r\nleaping the highest fences, and going extremely quick, without standing\r\nupon his stirrups, bearing on the bridle, or letting his horse run\r\nwild,--circumstances which young men look upon as so essential a part of\r\nEnglish horsemanship, that they would rather break a leg or an arm than\r\nrenounce them.\"\r\n\r\nComparatively few farmers in Virginia kept sheep, yet as early as 1758\r\nWashington's overseer at Mount Vernon reported sixty-five old sheep and\r\nforty-eight lambs; seven years later the total number was one hundred\r\nfifty-six. The next year he records that he \"put my English Ram Lamb to\r\n65 Ewes,\" so that evidently he was trying to improve the breed. What\r\nvariety this ram belonged to he does not say. Near the end of his career\r\nhe had some of Bakewell's breed, an English variety that put on fat\r\nrapidly and hence were particularly desirable for mutton.\r\n\r\nDuring his long absences from home his sheep suffered grievously, for\r\nsheep require a skilled care that few of his managers or overseers knew\r\nhow to give. But sheep were an important feature of the English\r\nagriculture that he imitated, and he persisted in keeping them. In 1793\r\nhe had over six hundred.\r\n\r\n\"Before I left home in the spring of 1789,\" he wrote to Arthur Young, \"I\r\nhad improved that species of my stock so much as to get 5-1/4 lbs of\r\nWool as the average of the fleeces of my whole flock,--and at the last\r\nshearing they did not yield me 2-1/2 lbs.--By procuring (if I am able)\r\ngood rams and giving the necessary attention, I hope to get them up\r\nagain for they are with me, as you have declared them to be with you,\r\nthat part of my stock in which I most delight.\"\r\n\r\nIn 1789, by request, he sent Young \"a fleece of a midling size and\r\nquality.\" Young had this made up into cloth and returned it to\r\nthe General.\r\n\r\nIn 1793 we find our Farmer giving such instructions to Whiting as to\r\ncull out the unthrifty sheep and transform them into mutton and to\r\nchoose a few of the best young males to keep as rams. Whiting, however,\r\ndid not manage the flock well, for the following February we find\r\nPearce, the new manager, writing:\r\n\r\n\"I am sorry to have to inform you that the stock of sheep at Both Union\r\nand Dogue Run farms are Some of them Dicing Every Week--& a great many\r\nof Them will be lost, let what will be done--Since I came I have had\r\nshelters made for them & Troughs to feed them In & to give them salt--&\r\nhave attended to them myself & was In hopes to have saved those that I\r\nfound to be weak, but they were too far gone--and Several of the young\r\nCattle at Dogue Run was past all Recovery when I come & some have died\r\nalready & several more I am afraid must die before spring, they are so\r\nvery poor and weak.\"\r\n\r\nWashington, according to his own account, was the first American to\r\nattempt the raising of mules. Soon after the Revolution he asked our\r\nrepresentative in Spain to ascertain whether it would be possible \"to\r\nprocure permission to extract a Jack ass of the best breed.\" At that\r\ntime the exportation of these animals from Spain was forbidden by law,\r\nbut Florida Blanca, the Spanish minister of state, brought the matter\r\nto the attention of the king, who in a fit of generosity proceeded to\r\nsend the American hero two jacks and two jennets. One of the jacks died\r\non the way over, but the other animals, in charge of a Spanish\r\ncaretaker, reached Boston, and Washington despatched an overseer to\r\nescort them to Mount Vernon, where they arrived on the fifth of\r\nDecember, 1785. An interpreter named Captain Sullivan was brought down\r\nfrom Alexandria, and through him the General propounded to the caretaker\r\nmany grave inquiries regarding the care of the beasts, the answers being\r\ncarefully set down in writing.\r\n\r\n[ILLUSTRATION: Bill of Lading for \"Royal Gift\"]\r\n\r\n\"Royal Gift,\" as he was duly christened, probably by the negro groom,\r\nPeter, who seems to have considered it beneath his dignity to minister\r\nto any but royalty, was a large animal. According to careful\r\nmeasurements taken on the porch at Mount Vernon he was fifteen hands\r\nhigh, and his body and limbs were very large in proportion to his\r\nheight; his ears were fourteen inches long, and his vocal cords were\r\ngood. He was, however, a sluggish beast, and the sea voyage had affected\r\nhim so unfavorably that for some time he was of little use. In letters\r\nto Lafayette and others Washington commented facetiously upon the\r\nbeast's failure to appreciate \"republican enjoyment.\" Ultimately,\r\nhowever, \"Royal Gift\" recovered his strength and ambition and proved a\r\nvaluable piece of property. He was presently sent on a lour of the\r\nSouth, and while in South Carolina was in the charge of Colonel William\r\nWashington, a hero of the Cowpens and many other battles. The profits\r\nfrom the tour amounted to $678.64, yet poor \"Royal Gift\" seems to have\r\nexperienced some rough usage on the way thither, arriving lame and thin\r\nand in a generally debilitated condition. The General wrote to the\r\nColonel about it thus:\r\n\r\n\"From accounts which I have received from some gentlemen in Virginia he\r\nwas most abominably treated on the journey by the man to whom he was\r\nentrusted;--for, instead of moving him slowly and steadily along as he\r\nought, he was prancing (with the Jack) from one public meeting or place\r\nto another in a gate which could not but prove injurious to an animal\r\nwho had hardly ever been out of a walk before--and afterward, I presume,\r\n(in order to recover lost time) rushed him beyond what he was able to\r\nbear the remainder of the journey.\"\r\n\r\nNo doubt the beast aroused great curiosity along the way among people\r\nwho had never before set eyes upon such a creature. We can well believe\r\nthat the cry, \"General Washington's jackass is coming!\" was always\r\nsufficient to attract a gaping crowd. And many would be the sage\r\ncomments upon the animal's voice and appearance.\r\n\r\nIn 1786 Lafayette sent Washington from the island of Malta another jack\r\nand two jennets, besides some Chinese pheasants and partridges. The\r\nanimals landed at Baltimore in November and reached Mount Vernon in good\r\ncondition later in the month. To Campion, the man who accompanied them,\r\nWashington gave \"30 Louis dores for his trouble.\" The new jack, the\r\n\"Knight of Malta,\" as he was called, was a smaller beast than \"Royal\r\nGift,\" and his ears measured only twelve inches, but he was well formed\r\nand had the ferocity of a tiger.\r\n\r\nBy crossing the two strains Washington ultimately obtained a jack called\r\n\"Compound,\" who united in his person the size and strength of the \"Gift\"\r\nwith the courage and activity of the \"Knight.\" The General also raised\r\nmany mules, which he found to be good workers and more cheaply kept in\r\ncondition than horses.\r\n\r\nHenceforward the peaceful quiet of Mount Vernon was broken many times a\r\nday by sounds which, if not musical or mellifluous, were at least\r\njubilant and joyous.\r\n\r\nEvidently the sounds in no way disturbed the General, for in 1788 we\r\nfind him describing the acquisitions in enthusiastic terms to Arthur\r\nYoung. He called the mules \"a very excellent race of animals,\" cheap to\r\nkeep and willing workers. Recalling, perhaps, that a king's son once\r\nrode upon a mule, he proposes to breed heavy ones from \"Royal Gift\" for\r\ndraft purposes and lighter ones from the \"Knight\" for saddle or\r\ncarriage. He adds: \"Indeed in a few years, I intend to drive no other in\r\nmy carriage, having appropriated for the sole purpose of breeding them,\r\nupwards of twenty of my best mares.\"\r\n\r\nAh, friend George, what would the world not give to see thee and thy\r\nwife Martha driving in the Mount Vernon coach down Pennsylvania Avenue\r\nbehind four such long-eared beasts!\r\n\r\nIn all his stock raising, as in most other matters, Washington was\r\ngreatly hampered by the carelessness of his overseers and slaves. It is\r\nnotorious that free negroes will often forget or fail to water and feed\r\ntheir own horses, and it may easily be believed that when not influenced\r\nby fear, slaves would neglect the stock of their master. Among the\r\nGeneral's papers I have found a list of the animals that died upon his\r\nMount Vernon estate from April 16, 1789, to December 25, 1790. In that\r\nperiod of about twenty months he lost thirty-three horses, thirty-two\r\ncattle and sixty-five sheep! Considering the number of stock he had, a\r\nfifth of that loss would have been excessive. During most of the period\r\nhe was away from home looking after the affairs of the nation and in his\r\nabsence his own affairs suffered.\r\n\r\nHardly a report of his manager did not contain some bad news. Thus one\r\nof January, 1791, states that \"the Young black Brood Mare, with a long\r\ntail, which Came from Pennsylvania, said to be four Years old next\r\nspring ... was found with her thigh broke quite in two.\" This happened\r\non the Mansion House farm. On another farm a sheep was reported to have\r\nbeen killed by dogs while a second had died suddenly, perhaps from\r\neating some poisonous plant.\r\n\r\nDogs, in fact, constituted an ever present menace to the sheep and it\r\nwas only by constant watchfulness that the owner kept his negroes from\r\noverrunning the place with worthless curs. In 1792 he wrote to his\r\nmanager: \"I not only approve of your killing those Dogs which have been\r\nthe occasion of the late loss, & of thinning the Plantations of others,\r\nbut give it as a positive order that after saying what dog, or dogs\r\nshall remain, if any negro presumes under any pretence whatsoever, to\r\npreserve, or bring one into the family, that he shall be severely\r\npunished, and the dog hanged.--I was obliged to adopt this practice\r\nwhilst I resided at home, and from the same motive, that is for the\r\npreservation of my Sheep and Hogs.... It is not for any good purpose\r\nNegroes raise, and keep dogs; but to aid them in their night robberies;\r\nfor it is astonishing to see the command under which the dogs are.\"\r\n\r\nAfter the Revolution, in imitation of English farmers, he made use of\r\nhurdles in pasturing sheep and milk cows. Thereby he secured more even\r\ndistribution of the manure, which was one of his main objects in\r\nraising stock.\r\n\r\nWashington's interest in cattle seems to have been less intense than was\r\nthe case with some other kinds of stock. He always had a great number of\r\ncows, bulls, oxen and calves upon his farms--in 1793 over three hundred\r\n\"black cattle\" of all sorts. He was accustomed to brand his cattle with\r\nthe letters \"G.W.,\" the location of the brand on the body indicating\r\nthe farm on which the beast was raised. To what extent he endeavored to\r\nimprove the breed of his cattle I am unable to say, but I have found\r\nthat as early as 1770 he owned an English bull, which in July he killed\r\nand sold to the crew of the British frigate _Boston_, which lay in the\r\nPotomac off his estate. In 1797 he made inquiries looking toward the\r\npurchase of an improved bull calf from a cattle breeder named Gough, but\r\nupon learning that the price was two hundred dollars he decided not to\r\ninvest. Gough, however, heard of Washington's interest in his animals,\r\nand being an admirer of the General, gave him a calf. An English farmer,\r\nParkinson, who saw the animal in 1798, describes him in terms the\r\nreverse of enthusiastic, and of this more hereafter.\r\n\r\nA large part of the heavy work on all the farms was done by oxen. In\r\nNovember, 1785, there were thirteen yoke of these beasts on the Mount\r\nVernon estate and the number was sometimes still larger. In 1786\r\nWashington recorded putting \"a Collar on a large Bull in order to break\r\nhim to the draft.--at first he was sulky and restive but came to by\r\ndegrees.\" The owner always aimed to have enough oxen broken so that none\r\nwould have to be worked too hard, but he did not always succeed in his\r\naim. When they attained the age of eight years the oxen were usually\r\nfattened and killed for beef.\r\n\r\nThe management of the milk cows seems to have been very poor. In May,\r\n1793, we find the absent owner writing to his manager: \"If for the sake\r\nof making a little butter (for which I shall get scarcely anything) my\r\ncalves are starved, & die, it may be compared to stopping the spigot,\r\nand opening the faucit.\" Evidently the making of butter was almost\r\ntotally discontinued, for in his last instructions, completed only a few\r\ndays before his death, he wrote: \"And It is hoped and will be expected,\r\nthat more effectual measures will be pursued to make butter another\r\nyear; for it is almost beyond belief, that from 101 Cows actually\r\nreported on a late enumeration of the Cattle, that I am obliged to _buy\r\nbutter_ for the use of my family.\"\r\n\r\nIn his later years he became somewhat interested in the best methods of\r\nfeeding cattle and once suggested that the experiment be tried of\r\nfattening one bullock on potatoes, another on corn, and a third on a\r\nmixture of both, \"keeping an exact account of the time they are fatting,\r\nand what is eaten of each, and of hay, by the different steers; that a\r\njudgment may be formed of the best and least expensive mode of stall\r\nfeeding beef for market, or for my own use.\"\r\n\r\nDuring his early farming operations his swine probably differed little\r\nif at all from the razor-backs of his neighbors. They ranged half wild\r\nin the woods in summer and he once expressed the opinion that fully half\r\nthe pigs raised were stolen by the slaves, who loved roast pork fully as\r\nwell as did their master. In the fall the shoats were shut up to fatten.\r\nMore than a hundred were required each year to furnish meat for the\r\npeople on the estate; the average weight was usually less than one\r\nhundred forty pounds. Farmers in the Middle West would to-day have their\r\nPoland Chinas or Durocs of the same age weighing two hundred fifty to\r\nthree hundred pounds. Still the smallness of Washington's animals does\r\nnot necessarily indicate such bad management as may at first glance\r\nappear. Until of considerable size the pigs practically made their own\r\nliving, eating roots and mast in the woods, and they did not require\r\nmuch grain except during fattening time. And, after all, as the story\r\nhas it, \"what's time to a hawg?\"\r\n\r\nIn his later years he seems to have taken more interest in his pigs. By\r\n1786 he had decided that when fattening they ought to be put into\r\nclosed pens with a plank floor, a roof, running water and good troughs.\r\nA visitor to Mount Vernon in 1798 says that he had \"about 150 of the\r\nGuinea kind, with short legs and hollow back,\" so it is evident that he\r\nwas experimenting with new breeds. These Guinea swine were red in color,\r\nand it is said that the breed was brought to America from west Africa by\r\nslave traders. It was to these animals that Washington fed the\r\nby-products of his distillery.\r\n\r\nIn the slaughtering of animals he tried experiments as he did in so many\r\nother matters. In 1768 he killed a wether sheep which weighed one\r\nhundred three pounds gross. He found that it made sixty pounds of meat\r\nworth three pence per pound, five and a half of tallow at seven and a\r\nhalf pence, three of wool at fifteen pence, and the skin was worth one\r\nshilling and three pence, a total of £1.3.5. One object of such\r\nexperiments was to ascertain whether it was more profitable to butcher\r\nanimals or sell them on the hoof.\r\n\r\nWashington also raised chickens, turkeys, swans, ducks, geese and\r\nvarious other birds and beasts. In 1788 Gouverneur Morris sent him two\r\nChinese pigs and with them \"a pair of Chinese geese, which are really\r\nthe foolishest geese I ever beheld; for they choose all times for\r\nsetting but in the spring, and one of them is even now [November]\r\nactually engaged in that business.\" Of some golden pheasants that had\r\nbeen brought from China the General said that before seeing the birds he\r\nhad considered that pictures of them must be \"only works of fancy, but\r\nnow I find them to be only Portraits.\"\r\n\r\nThe fact is that his friends and admirers sent him so many feathered or\r\nfurred creatures that toward the end of his life he was the proprietor\r\nof a considerable zoo.\r\n\r\nNotwithstanding mismanagement by his employees and slaves, Washington\r\naccumulated much valuable domestic stock. In his will, made the year of\r\nhis death, he lists the following: \"1 Covering horse, 5 Cob. horses--4\r\nRiding do--Six brood mares--20 working horses and mares,--2 Covering\r\njacks & 3 young ones 10 she asses--42 working mules--15 younger ones.\r\n329 head of horned cattle. 640 head of Sheep, and the large stock of\r\nhogs, the precise number unknown.\" He further states that his manager\r\nbelieves the stock worth seven thousand pounds, but he conservatively\r\nsets it down at fifteen thousand six hundred fifty-three dollars.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER X\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE HORTICULTURIST AND LANDSCAPE GARDENER\r\n\r\nWashington's work as a horticulturist prior to the educating influences\r\nof the Revolution was mostly utilitarian. That he had a peach orchard as\r\nearly as 1760 is proven by an entry in his diary for February 22: \"Laid\r\nin part, the Worm of a fence round the Peach orchard.\" Just where this\r\norchard stood I am not quite certain, but it was probably on the slope\r\nnear the old tomb.\r\n\r\nHe learned how to propagate and \"wed\" his own trees and in 1763 was\r\nparticularly active. On March 21st he recorded that he had \"Grafted 40\r\ncherries, viz 12 Bullock Hearts, 18 very fine May Cherry, 10 Coronation.\r\nAlso grafted 12 Magnum Bonum Plums. Also planted 4 Nuts of the\r\nMediterranean Pame in the Pen where the Chestnut grows--sticks by East.\r\nNote, the Cherrys and Plums came from Collo. Masons Nuts from Mr.\r\nGr[een's.] Set out 55 cuttings of the Madeira Grape.\"\r\n\r\nA little later he grafted quinces on pear and apple stocks; also he\r\ngrafted \"Spanish pairs,\" \"Butter pears,\" \"Bergamy Pears,\" \"Newtown\r\nPippins,\" \"43 of the Maryland Red Strick,\" etc., and transplanted\r\nthirty-five young crab scions. These scions he obtained by planting the\r\npumice of wild crab apples from which cider had been made. They were\r\nsupposed to make hardier stocks than those grown from ordinary seeds.\r\n\r\nHe grafted many cherries, plums, etc., in March, 1764, and yet again in\r\nthe spring of 1765, when he put English mulberry scions on wild mulberry\r\nstocks. In that year \"Peter Green came to me a Gardener.\" In 1768 and\r\n1771 he planted grapes in the inclosure below the vegetable garden and\r\nin March, 1775, he again grafted cherries and also planted peach seeds\r\nand seeds of the \"Mississippi nut\" or pecan.\r\n\r\nLong before this he had begun to gather fruits from his early trees and\r\nvines. Being untroubled by San Jose scale and many other pests that now\r\nmake life miserable to the fruit grower, he grew fine products and no\r\ndoubt enjoyed them.\r\n\r\nHis esthetic sense was not yet fully developed, but he was always\r\ndesirous of having his possessions make a good appearance, and by 1768\r\nwas beginning to think of beautifying his grounds. In that year he\r\nexpressed a wish that he later carried out, namely to have about his\r\nmansion house every possible specimen of native tree or shrub noted for\r\nbeauty of form, leaf or flower.\r\n\r\nEven amid the trials of the Revolution this desire was not forgotten. In\r\n1782 he directed Lund Washington, his manager, to plant locusts and\r\nother ornamental trees and shrubs at the ends of the house. He wrote\r\nthat such trees would be more likely to live if taken from the open\r\nfields than from the woods because the change of environment would be\r\nless pronounced. To what extent the work was carried I have been unable\r\nto ascertain, for, as elsewhere stated, very little of his\r\ncorrespondence with his manager during these years survives.\r\n\r\nHe returned from the Revolution with a strong desire to beautify his\r\nestate, a desire in part due no doubt to seeing beautiful homes\r\nelsewhere and to contact with cultured people, both Americans and\r\nforeigners. One of his first tasks was to rebuild and enlarge his house.\r\nFrom a small house of eight rooms he transformed Mount Vernon into the\r\npresent large mansion, ninety-six feet and four inches long by\r\nthirty-two feet in depth, with two floors and an attic, an immense\r\ncellar and the magnificent portico overlooking the Potomac. The plans\r\nand specifications he drew with his own hands, and those who have\r\nvisited the place will hardly deny that the mansion fits well into its\r\nsetting and that, architects tell us, is a prime consideration. The\r\nflagstones for the floor of the portico he imported from Whitehaven,\r\nEngland, and these still remain in place, though many are cracked\r\nor broken.\r\n\r\nThe portico runs the entire length of the house, is over fourteen feet\r\ndeep and its floor is one hundred twenty-four feet ten and one-half\r\ninches above high water-mark, according to calculations made by\r\nWashington himself. From it one commands miles of the Potomac and of the\r\nMaryland shore and there are few such noble prospects in America.\r\nWashington owned a telescope and spy glasses and with them could watch\r\nthe movements of ships and boats on the river. The portico was a sort of\r\ntrysting place for the family and visitors on summer afternoons and\r\nevenings, and some of the thirty or so Windsor chairs bought for it are\r\nstill in existence.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: West Front of Mansion House, Showing Bowling Green and\r\nPart of Serpentine Drive]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Experimental Plot, with Servants' Quarters (restored) in\r\nBackground]\r\n\r\nThis was the second time our Farmer reconstructed his house, as in\r\n1758-60 he had made numerous alterations[6]. In 1758 he paid John\r\nPatterson £328.0.5 for work done upon it, and the whole house was pretty\r\nthoroughly renovated and remodeled in preparation for the reception of a\r\nnew mistress. In March, 1760, we find the owner contracting with William\r\nTriplett \"to build me two houses in front of my house (plastering them\r\nalso) and running walls to them from the great house and from the great\r\nhouse to the washouse and kitchen also.\" By the \"front\" he means the\r\nwest front, as that part toward the river is really the rear of the\r\nmansion. Hitherto the house had stood detached and these walls were the\r\noriginals of the colonnades, still a noticeable feature of the building.\r\n\r\n[6] In 1775 a Frenchman was engaged to panel the main hall and apply\r\nstucco ornaments to the ceilings of the parlor and dining-room.\r\n\r\nOwing to the absence of a diary of his home activities during 1784 we\r\ncan not trace in detail his work that year upon either his house or\r\ngrounds, but we know such facts as that he was ordering materials for\r\nthe house and that he had his French friend Malesherbes and others\r\ncollecting vines and plants for him.\r\n\r\nWith January 1, 1785, he began a new diary, and from it we ascertain\r\nthat on the twelfth, on a ride about his estate, he observed many trees\r\nand shrubs suitable for transplanting. Thereafter he rarely rode out\r\nwithout noticing some crab, holly, magnolia, pine or other young tree\r\nthat would serve his purpose. He was more alive to the beauties of\r\nnature than he had once been, or at least more inclined to comment upon\r\nthem. On an April day he notes that \"the flower of the Sassafras was\r\nfully out and looked well--an intermixture of this and Red bud I\r\nconceive would look very pretty--the latter crowned with the former or\r\nvice versa.\" He was no gushing spring poet, but when the sap was\r\nrunning, the flowers blooming and the birds singing he felt it all in\r\nhis heart--perhaps more deeply than do some who say more about it.\r\n\r\nOn January 19th of this year he began laying out his grounds on a new\r\nplan. This plan, as completed, provided for sunken walls or \"Haw has!\"\r\nat the ends of the mansion, and on the west front a large elliptical\r\nlawn or bowling green such as still exists there. Along the sides of the\r\nlawn he laid out a serpentine drive or carriage way, to be bordered with\r\na great variety of shade trees on each side and a \"Wilderness\" on the\r\noutside. At the extreme west, where the entrance stood, the trees were\r\nomitted so that from the house one could see down a long vista, cut\r\nthrough the oaks and evergreens, the lodge gate three-quarters of a mile\r\naway. On each side of the opening in the lawn stood a small artificial\r\nmound, and just in front of the house a sun-dial by which each day, when\r\nthe weather was clear, he set his watch. A sun-dial stands on the same\r\nspot now but, alas, it is not the original. That was given away or sold\r\nby one of the subsequent owners.\r\n\r\nThis same spring our Farmer records planting ivy, limes and lindens sent\r\nby his good friend Governor Clinton of New York; lilacs, mock oranges,\r\naspen, mulberries, black gums, berried thorns, locusts, sassafras,\r\nmagnolia, crabs, service berries, catalpas, papaws, honey locusts, a\r\nlive oak from Norfolk, yews, aspens, swamp berries, hemlocks, twelve\r\nhorse chestnut sent by \"Light Horse Harry\" Lee, twelve cuttings of tree\r\nbox, buckeye nuts brought by him the preceding year from the mouth of\r\nCheat River, eight nuts from a tree called \"the Kentucke Coffee tree,\" a\r\nrow of shell bark hickory nuts from New York, some filberts from \"sister\r\nLewis.\" His brother John sent him four barrels of holly seeds, which he\r\nsowed in the semicircle north of the front gate; in the south\r\nsemicircle, from the kitchen to the south \"Haw ha!\"; and from the\r\nservants' hall to the north \"Haw ha!\"\r\n\r\nNor did he neglect more utilitarian work, for in April he grafted many\r\ncherries, pears and other fruit trees. Such work was continued at\r\nintervals till his death.\r\n\r\nIn raising fruit, as in many other things, he was troubled by the\r\nthieving propensities of the slaves. September tenth of this year he\r\nrecords that because of the scarcity of apples and the depredations that\r\nwere being committed \"every Night upon the few I have, I found it\r\nnecessary (tho much too early) to gather and put them up for\r\nWinter use.\"\r\n\r\nThe spring of 1785 proved an exceptionally dry one and he was forced to\r\nbe absent from home several days, leaving the care of the trees and\r\nshrubs to his careless lazy servants. He records that they _said_ that\r\nthey watered them according to directions, but he seems to doubt it. At\r\nall events, \"Most of my transplanted trees have a sickly look.--The\r\nsmall Pines in the Wilderness are entirely dead.--The larger ones in the\r\nWalks, for the most part appear to be alive (as yet)--almost the whole\r\nof the Holly are dead--many of the Ivy, wch. before looked healthy &\r\nwell seem to be declining--few of the Crab trees had put forth leaves;\r\nnot a single Ash tree has unfolded its buds; whether owing to the trees\r\ndeclining or any other cause, I know not.... The lime trees, which had\r\nsome appearance of Budding when I went away, are now withering--and the\r\nHorse chestnut & Tree box from Colo. Harry Lee's discover little signs\r\nof shooting.--the Hemlock is almost entirely dead, & bereft of their\r\nleaves;--and so are the live Oak.--In short half the Trees in the\r\nShrubberies & many in the Walk are dead & declin[in]g.\"\r\n\r\nNevertheless he refused to be discouraged and proceeded to plant\r\nforty-eight mahogany tree seeds brought by his nephew, George A.\r\nWashington, from the West Indies. He also set out a \"Palmetto Royal\" in\r\nthe garden and sowed or planted sandbox trees, palmettos, physic nuts,\r\npride of Chinas, live oaks, accacias, bird peppers, \"Caya pepper,\"\r\nprivet, guinea grass, and a great variety of Chinese grasses, the names\r\nof which, such as _\"In che fa,\" \"all san fa\" \"se lon fa,\"_ he gravely\r\nset down in his diary.\r\n\r\nThe dry weather continued and presently he notes that all the poplars,\r\nblack gums and pines, most of the mulberries, all of the crab apples\r\nand papaws, most of the hemlock and sassafras, and several of the cedars\r\nare dead, while the tops of the live oaks are dead but shoots are coming\r\nup from the trunks and roots. The Chinese grasses are in a bad way, and\r\nthose that have come up are almost entirely destroyed either by insects\r\nor drought. None of this grass survived the winter, though he took the\r\ntrouble to cover it with straw.\r\n\r\nDuring the fall of 1785 and spring of 1786 he sowed the lawn with\r\nEnglish grass seeds, replaced the dead trees in the serpentine walks and\r\nshrubberies, and sent two hundred and fifteen apple trees to his River\r\nPlantation. He made the two low mounds already mentioned and planted\r\nthereon weeping willows. He set out stocks of imported hawthorns, four\r\nyellow jessamines, twenty-five of the Palinurus for hedges, forty-six\r\npistacia nuts and seventy-five pyramidical cypress, which last were\r\nbrought to him by the botanist Michaux from the King of France. As 1786\r\nwas one of the wettest summers ever known, his plants and trees lived\r\nbetter than they had done the preceding year.\r\n\r\nDuring this period and until the end of his life he was constantly\r\nreceiving trees and shrubs from various parts of the world. Thus in\r\n1794 he sent to Alexandria by Thomas Jefferson a bundle of \"Poccon\r\n[pecan] or Illinois nut,\" which in some way had come to him at\r\nPhiladelphia. He instructed the gardener to set these out at Mount\r\nVernon, also to sow some seeds of the East India hemp that had been left\r\nin his care. The same year thirty-nine varieties of tropical plants,\r\nincluding the bread fruit tree, came to him from a well wisher in\r\nJamaica. At other times he sowed seeds of the cucumber tree, chickory\r\nand \"colliflower\" and planted ivy and wild honeysuckle. Again he once\r\nmore planted pecans and hickory nuts. It can hardly be that at his\r\nadvanced age he expected to derive any personal good from either of\r\nthese trees, but he was very fond of nuts, eating great quantities for\r\ndessert, and the liking inclined him to grow trees that produced them.\r\nIn this, as in many other matters, he planted for the benefit of\r\nposterity.\r\n\r\nIn order to care for his exotic plants he built adjoining the upper\r\ngarden a considerable conservatory or hothouse. In this he placed many\r\nof the plants sent to him as presents and also purchased many others\r\nfrom the collection of the celebrated botanist, John Bartram, at\r\nPhiladelphia. The structure, together with the servants' quarters\r\nadjoining, was burned down in December, 1835, and when the historian\r\nLossing visited Mount Vernon in 1858 nothing remained of these buildings\r\nexcept bare walls crumbling to decay. Of the movable plants that had\r\nbelonged to Washington there remained in 1858 only a lemon tree, a\r\ncentury plant and a sago palm, all of which have since died. The\r\nconservatory and servants' quarters have, however, been rebuilt and the\r\nconservatory restocked with plants such as Washington kept in it. The\r\nbuildings probably look much as they did in his time.\r\n\r\nOne of the sights to-day at Mount Vernon is the formal garden, which all\r\nwho have visited the place will remember. Strangely enough it seems\r\nimpossible to discover exactly when this was laid out as it now stands.\r\nThe guides follow tradition and tell visitors that Washington set out\r\nthe box hedge, the principal feature, after his marriage, and that he\r\ntold Martha that she should be mistress of this flower garden and he the\r\nmaster of the vegetable garden. It is barely possible that he did set\r\nout the hedges at that time, but, if so, it must have been in 1759, for\r\nno mention is made of it in the diary begun in 1760. In April, 1785, we\r\nfind by his diary that he planted twelve cuttings of the \"tree box\" and\r\nagain in the spring of 1787 he planted in his shrubberies some holly\r\ntrees, \"also ... some of the slips of the tree box.\" But of box hedges I\r\ncan find no mention in any of the papers I have seen. One guess is about\r\nas good as another, and I am inclined to believe that if they were\r\nplanted in his time, it was done during his presidency by one of his\r\ngardeners, perhaps Butler or the German, Ehler. They may have been set\r\nout long after his death. At all events the garden was modeled after the\r\nformal gardens of Europe and the idea was not original with him.\r\n\r\nEast of the formal garden lies a plot of ground that he used for\r\nagricultural experiments. The vegetable garden was south of the Bowling\r\nGreen and separated from it by a brick wall. Here utility was lord and a\r\ngreat profusion of products was raised for the table. Washington took an\r\ninterest in its management and I have found an entry in his diary\r\nrecording the day that green peas were available for the first time that\r\nyear. Evidently he was fond of them.\r\n\r\nThe bent of our Farmer's mind was to the practical, yet he took pride in\r\nthe appearance of his estate. \"I shall begrudge no reasonable expense\r\nthat will contribute to the improvement and neatness of my farms,\" he\r\nwrote one of his managers, \"for nothing pleases me better than to see\r\nthem in good order, and everything trim, handsome, and thriving about\r\nthem; nor nothing hurts me more than to find them otherwise.\"\r\n\r\nLive hedges tend to make a place look well and it was probably this and\r\nhis passion for trees that caused Washington to go in extensively for\r\nhedges about his farms. They took the place of wooden fences and saved\r\ntrees and also grew more trees and bushes. His ordinary course in\r\nbuilding a fence was to have a trench dug on each side of the line and\r\nthe dirt thrown toward the center. Upon the ridge thus formed he built a\r\npost and rail fence and along it planted cedars, locusts, pines, briars\r\nor thorn bushes to discourage cattle and other stock. The trenches not\r\nonly increased the efficiency of the fence but also served as ditches.\r\nIn many places they are still discernible. The lines of the hedges are\r\nalso often marked in many places by trees which, though few or none can\r\nbe the originals, are descended from the roots or seeds of those trees.\r\nCedar and locust trees are particularly noticeable.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: First page of the Diary for 1760]\r\n\r\nIn 1794 our Farmer had five thousand white thorn sent from England for\r\nhedge purposes, but they arrived late in the spring and few survived and\r\neven these did not thrive very well. Another time he sent from\r\nPhiladelphia two bushels of honey locust seed to be planted in his\r\nnursery. These are only instances of his activities in this direction.\r\n\r\nMuch of what he undertook as a planter of trees failed for one reason or\r\nanother, most of all because he attended to the business of his country\r\nat the expense of his own, but much that he attempted succeeded and\r\nenough still remains to enable us to realize that by his efforts he made\r\nhis estate attractive. He was no Barbarian or Philistine. He had a sense\r\nof beauty and it is only in recent years that his countrymen, absorbed\r\nin material undertakings, have begun to appreciate the things that he\r\nwas enjoying so long ago.\r\n\r\n\"The visitor at Mount Vernon still finds a charm no art alone could\r\ngive, in trees from various climes, each a witness of the taste that\r\nsought, or the love that sent them, in fields which the desolating step\r\nof war reverently passed by, in flowers whose root is not in graves, yet\r\ntinged with the lifeblood of the heart that cherished them from\r\nchildhood to old age. On those acres we move beneath the shade or\r\nshelter of the invisible tree which put forth whatever meets the eye,\r\nand has left some sign on each object, large or small. Still planted\r\nbeside his river, he brings forth fruit in his season. Nor does his\r\nleaf wither.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XI\r\n\r\n\r\nWHITE SERVANTS AND OVERSEERS\r\n\r\nIn colonial Virginia, as in most other new countries, one of the\r\ngreatest problems that confronted the settlers was that of labor. It\r\ntook human muscle to clear away the forest and tend the crops, and the\r\nquantity of human muscle available was small. One solution of the\r\nproblem was the importation of black slaves, and of this solution as it\r\nconcerned Washington something will be said in a separate chapter.\r\nAnother solution was the white indentured servant.\r\n\r\nSome of these white servants were political offenders, such as the\r\nfollowers of Monmouth, who were punished by transportation for a term of\r\nyears or for life to the plantations. Others were criminals or\r\nunfortunate debtors who were sold in America instead of being sent to\r\njail. Others were persons who had been kidnapped and carried across the\r\nsea into servitude. Yet others were men and women who voluntarily bound\r\nthemselves to work for a term of years in payment of their passage to\r\nthe colonies. By far the largest number of the white servants in\r\nWashington's day belonged to this last-mentioned class, who were often\r\ncalled \"redemptioners.\" Some of these were ambitious, well-meaning\r\npeople, perhaps skilled artisans, who after working out their time\r\nbecame good citizens and often prospered. A few were even well educated.\r\nIn favor of the convicts, however, little could be said. In general they\r\nwere ignorant and immoral and greatly lowered the level of the\r\npopulation in the Southern States, the section to which most of them\r\nwere sent.\r\n\r\nWhether they came to America of their own free will or not such servants\r\nwere subjected to stringent regulations and were compelled to complete\r\ntheir terms of service. If they ran away, they could be pursued and\r\nbrought back by force, and the papers of the day were full of\r\nadvertisements for such absconders. Owing to their color and the ease\r\nwith which they found sympathizers among the white population, however,\r\nthe runaways often managed to make good their escape.\r\n\r\nTo give a complete list of Washington's indentured servants, even if it\r\nwere possible, would be tedious and tiresome. For the most part he\r\nbought them in order to obtain skilled workmen. Thus in 1760 we find him\r\nwriting to a Doctor Ross, of Philadelphia, to purchase for him a joiner,\r\na brick-layer and a gardener, if any ship with servants was in port. As\r\nlate as 1786 he bought the time of a Dutchman named Overdursh, who was a\r\nditcher and mower, and of his wife, a spinner, washer and milker; also\r\ntheir daughter. The same year he \"received from on board the Brig Anna,\r\nfrom Ireland, two servant men for whom I agreed yesterday--viz--Thomas\r\nRyan, a shoemaker, and Cavan Bowen a Tayler Redemptioners for 3 years\r\nservice by Indenture.\" These cost him twelve pounds each. The story of\r\nhis purchase of servants for his western lands is told in another place,\r\nas is also that of his plan to import Palatines for the same purpose.\r\n\r\nOn the day of Lexington and Concord, but before the news of that\r\nconflict reached Virginia, two of his indentured servants ran away and\r\nhe published a lengthy advertisement of them in the Virginia _Gazette_,\r\noffering a reward of forty dollars for the return of both or twenty\r\ndollars for the return of either. They were described as follows:\r\n\r\n\"THOMAS SPEARS, a joiner, born in _Bristol_, about 20 years of age, 5\r\nfeet 6 inches and a half high, slender made. He has light grey or\r\nblueish colored eyes, a little pock-marked, and freckled, with sandy\r\ncolored hair, cut short; his voice is coarse, and somewhat drawling. He\r\ntook with him a coat, waistcoat, and breeches, of light brown duffil,\r\nwith black horn buttons, a light colored cloth waistcoat, old leather\r\nbreeches, check and oznabrig shirts, a pair of old ribbed ditto, new\r\noznabrig trowsers, and a felt hat, not much the worse for wear. WILLIAM\r\nWEBSTER, a brick maker, born in _Scotland_, and talks pretty broad. He\r\nis about 5 feet six inches high and well made, rather turned of 30, with\r\nlight brown hair, and roundish face.... They went off in a small yawl,\r\nwith turpentine sides and bottom, the inside painted with a mixture of\r\ntar and red lead.\"\r\n\r\nIn the course of his business career Washington also employed a\r\nconsiderable number of free white men, who likewise were usually skilled\r\nworkers or overseers. He commonly engaged them for the term of one year\r\nand by written contracts, which he drew up himself, a thing he had\r\nlearned to do when a boy by copying legal forms. Many of these papers\r\nstill survive and contracts with joiners and gardeners jostle inaugural\r\naddresses and opinions of cabinet meetings.\r\n\r\nAs a rule the hired employees received a house, an allowance of corn,\r\nflour, meat and perhaps other articles, the money payment being\r\ncomparatively small.\r\n\r\nSome of the contracts contain peculiar stipulations. That with a certain\r\noverseer provided: \"And whereas there are a number of whiskey stills\r\nvery contiguous to the said Plantations, and many idle, drunken and\r\ndissolute People continually resorting the same, priding themselves in\r\ndebauching sober and well-inclined Persons the said Edd. Voilett doth\r\npromise as well for his own sake as his employers to avoid them as\r\nhe ought.\"\r\n\r\nProbably most readers have heard of the famous contract with the\r\ngardener Philip Bater, who had a weakness for the output of stills such\r\nas those mentioned above. It was executed in 1787 and, in consideration\r\nof Bater's agreement \"not to be disguised with liquor except on times\r\nhereinafter mentioned,\" provided that he should be given \"four dollars\r\nat Christmas, with which he may be drunk four days and four nights; two\r\ndollars at Easter to effect the same purpose; two dollars at\r\nWhitsuntide to be drunk for two days; a dram in the morning, and a drink\r\nof grog at dinner at noon.\"\r\n\r\nWashington's most famous white servant was Thomas Bishop, who figures in\r\nsome books as a negro. He had been the personal servant of General\r\nBraddock, and tradition says that the dying General commended him to\r\nWashington. At all events Washington took him into his service at ten\r\npounds per year and, except for a short interval about 1760, Bishop\r\nremained one of his retainers until death. It was Bishop and John Alton\r\nwho accompanied Washington on his trip to New York and Boston in\r\n1756--that trip in the course of which, according to imaginative\r\nhistorians, the young officer became enamored of the heiress Mary\r\nPhillipse. Doubtless the men made a brave show along the way, for we\r\nknow that Washington had ordered for them \"2 complete livery suits for\r\nservants; with a spare cloak and all other necessary trimmings for two\r\nsuits more. I would have you choose the livery by our arms, only as the\r\nfield of arms is white, I think the clothes had better not be quite so,\r\nbut nearly like the inclosed. The trimmings and facings of scarlet, and\r\na scarlet waist coat. If livery lace is not quite disused, I should be\r\nglad to have the cloaks laced. I like that fashion best, and two silver\r\nlaced hats for the above servants.\"\r\n\r\nWhen the Revolution came Bishop was too old to take the field and was\r\nleft at home as the manager of a plantation. He was allowed a house, for\r\nhe had married and was now the father of a daughter. He lived to a great\r\nage, but on fair days, when the Farmer was at home, the old man always\r\nmade it a point to grasp his cane and walk out to the road to see his\r\nmaster ride by, to salute him and to pass a friendly word. He seems to\r\nhave thought of leaving Mount Vernon with his daughter in 1794, for the\r\nPresident wrote to Pearce: \"Old Bishop must be taken care of whether he\r\ngoes or stays.\" He died the following January, while Washington was away\r\nin Philadelphia.\r\n\r\nCustis tells an amusing story of Bishop's daughter Sally. Following the\r\nRevolution two of Washington's aides-de-camp, Colonels Smith and\r\nHumphreys, the latter a poet of some pretensions, spent considerable\r\ntime at Mount Vernon arranging the General's military papers. One\r\nafternoon Smith strolled out from the Mansion House for relaxation and\r\ncame upon Sally, then in her teens and old enough to be interesting to\r\na soldier, milking a cow. When she started for the house with the pail\r\nof milk the Colonel gallantly stepped forward and asked to be permitted\r\nto carry it. But Sally had heard from her father dire tales of what\r\nbefell damsels who had anything to do with military men and the fact\r\nthat Smith was a fine-looking young fellow in no way lessened her sense\r\nof peril. In great panic she flung down the pail, splashing the contents\r\nover the officer, and ran screaming to the house. Smith followed, intent\r\nupon allaying her alarm and ran plump into old Bishop, who at once\r\naccused him of attempting to philander with the girl, turned a deaf ear\r\nto all the Colonel's explanations, and declared that he would bring word\r\nof the offense to his honor the General, nay more, to Mrs. Washington!\r\n\r\nIn great alarm the Colonel betook himself toward the Mansion House\r\npondering upon some way of getting himself out of the scrape he had\r\nfallen into. At last he bethought himself of Billy Lee, the mulatto body\r\nservant, and these two old soldiers proceeded to hold a council of war.\r\nSmith said: \"It's bad enough, Billy, for this story to get to the\r\nGeneral's ears, but to those of the lady will never do; and then\r\nthere's Humphreys, he will be out upon me in a d--d long poem that will\r\nspread my misfortunes from Dan to Beersheba!\" At last it was decided\r\nthat Billy should act as special ambassador to Bishop and endeavor to\r\ndivert him from his purpose. Meanwhile Bishop had got out his old\r\nclothes--Cumberland cocked hat and all--of the period of the French War,\r\nhad dressed with great care and, taking up his staff, had laid his line\r\nof march straight to the Mansion House. Billy met him midway upon the\r\nroad and much skirmishing ensued, Billy taking two lines of attack:\r\nfirst, that Smith was a perfect gentleman, and, second, that Bishop had\r\nno business to have such a devilishly pretty daughter. Finally these\r\ntactics prevailed, Bishop took the right about, and a guinea dropped\r\ninto the ambassador's palm completed the episode.\r\n\r\nIn due time Sally lost her dreadful fear of men and married the\r\nplantation carpenter, Thomas Green, with whose shiftless ways, described\r\nelsewhere, Washington put up for a long time for the sake of \"his\r\nfamily.\" Ultimately Green quitted Washington's service and seems to have\r\ndeserted his wife or else died; at all events she and her family were\r\nleft in distressed circumstances. She wrote a letter to Washington\r\nbegging assistance and he instructed his manager to aid her to the\r\nextent of £20 but to tell her that if she set up a shop in Alexandria,\r\nas she thought of doing, she must not buy anything of his negroes. He\r\nseems to have allowed her a little wood, flour and meat at killing time\r\nand in 1796 instructed Pearce that if she and her family were really in\r\ndistress, as reported, to afford them some relief, \"but in my opinion it\r\nhad better be in anything than money, for I very strongly suspect that\r\nall that has, and perhaps all that will be given to her in that article,\r\nis applied more in rigging herself, than in the purchase of real and\r\nuseful necessaries for her family.\"\r\n\r\nBy his will Washington left Sally Green and Ann Walker, daughter of John\r\nAlton, each one hundred dollars in \"consideration of the attachment of\r\ntheir father[s] to me.\"\r\n\r\nAlton entered Washington's service even before Bishop, accompanying him\r\nas a body servant on the Braddock campaign and suffering a serious\r\nillness. He subsequently was promoted to the management of a plantation\r\nand enjoyed Washington's confidence and esteem. It was with a sad heart\r\nthat Washington penned in his diary for 1785: \"Last night Jno. Alton an\r\nOverseer of mine in the Neck--an old & faithful Servant who has lived\r\nwith me 30 odd years died--and this evening the wife of Thos. Bishop,\r\nanother old Servant who had lived with me an equal number of years\r\nalso died.\"\r\n\r\nThe adoption of Mrs. Washington's two youngest grandchildren, Nelly\r\nCustis and George Washington Custis, made necessary the employment of a\r\ntutor. One applicant was Noah Webster, who visited Mount Vernon in 1785,\r\nbut for some reason did not engage. A certain William Shaw had charge\r\nfor almost a year and then in 1786 Tobias Lear, a native of New\r\nHampshire and a graduate of Harvard, was employed. It is supposed that\r\nsome of the lessons were taught in the small circular building in the\r\ngarden; Washington himself refers to it as \"the house in the Upper\r\nGarden called the School house.\"\r\n\r\nLear's duties were by no means all pedagogical and ultimately he became\r\nWashington's private secretary. In Philadelphia he and his family lived\r\nin the presidential mansion. Washington had for him \"a particular\r\nfriendship,\" an almost fatherly affection. His interest in Lear's little\r\nson Lincoln was almost as great as he would have bestowed upon his own\r\ngrandson. Apropos of the recovery of the child from a serious illness he\r\nwrote in 1793: \"It gave Mrs. Washington, myself, and all who knew him\r\nsincere pleasure to hear that our little favourite had arrived safe and\r\nwas in good health at Portsmouth--we sincerely wish him a long\r\ncontinuance of the latter--that he may be always as charming and\r\npromising as he now is--that he may live to be a comfort and blessing to\r\nyou--and an ornament to his Country. As a token of my affection for him\r\nI send him a ticket in the lottery that's now drawing in the Federal\r\nCity; if it should be his fortune to draw the Hotel, it will add to the\r\npleasure I feel in giving it.\"\r\n\r\nTruly a rather singular gift for a child, we would think in these days.\r\nLet us see how it turned out. The next May Washington wrote to Lear,\r\nthen in Europe on business for the Potomac Navigation Company, of which\r\nhe had become president: \"Often, through the medium of Mr. Langdon, we\r\nhear of your son Lincoln, and with pleasure, that he continues to be the\r\nhealthy and sprightly child he formerly was. He declared if his ticket\r\nshould turn up a prize, he would go and live in the Federal City. He did\r\nnot consider, poor little fellow, that some of the prizes would hardly\r\nbuild him a baby house nor foresee that one of these small tickets would\r\nbe his lot, having drawn no more than ten dollars.\"\r\n\r\nLear's first wife had died the year before of yellow fever at the\r\nPresident's house in Philadelphia, and for his second he took the widow\r\nof George A. Washington--Fanny--who was a niece of Martha Washington,\r\nbeing a daughter of Anna Dandridge Bassett and Colonel Burwell Bassett.\r\nThis alliance tended to strengthen the friendly relations between Lear\r\nand the General. In Washington's last moments Lear held his dying hand\r\nand later penned a noble description of the final scene that reveals a\r\nman of high and tender sentiments with a true appreciation of his\r\nbenefactor's greatness. Washington willed him the use of three hundred\r\nsixty acres east of Hunting Creek during life. When Fanny Lear died,\r\nLear married Frances Dandridge Henley, another niece of Mrs. Washington.\r\nLear's descendants still own a quilt made by Martha Washington and given\r\nto this niece.\r\n\r\nDuring part at least of Washington's absence in the French war his\r\nyounger brother John Augustine, described in the General's will as \"the\r\nintimate friend of my ripened age,\" had charge of his business affairs\r\nand resided at Mount Vernon. The relations with this brother were\r\nunusually close and Washington took great interest in John's eldest son\r\nBushrod, who studied law and became an associate justice of the Federal\r\nSupreme Court. To Bushrod the General gave his papers, library, the\r\nMansion House Farm and other land and a residuary share in the estate.\r\n\r\nI am inclined to believe that during 1757-58 John Augustine did not have\r\ncharge, as Mount Vernon seems to have been under the oversight of a\r\ncertain Humphrey Knight, who worked the farm on shares. He was evidently\r\na good farmer, for in 1758 William Fairfax, who kept a friendly eye upon\r\nhis absent neighbor's affairs, wrote: \"You have some of the finest\r\nTobacco & Corn I have seen this year,\" The summer was, however,\r\nexceedingly dry and the crop was good in a relative sense only. Knight\r\ntried to keep affairs in good running order and the men hard at work,\r\nreporting \"as to ye Carpentrs I have minded em all I posably could, and\r\nhas whipt em when I could see a fault.\" Knight died September 9, 1758, a\r\nfew months before Washington's marriage.\r\n\r\nWashington's general manager during the Revolution was Lund Washington,\r\na distant relative. He was a man of energy and ability and retired\r\nagainst protests in 1785. Unfortunately not much of the correspondence\r\nbetween the two has come down to us, as Lund destroyed most of the\r\nGeneral's letters. Why he did so I do not know, though possibly it was\r\nbecause in them Washington commented freely about persons and sections.\r\nIn one that remains, for example, written soon after his assumption of\r\ncommand at Cambridge, the General speaks disparagingly of some New\r\nEngland officers and says of the troops that they may fight well, but\r\nare \"dirty fellows.\" When the British visited Mount Vernon in 1781 Lund\r\nconciliated them by furnishing them provisions, thereby drawing down\r\nupon himself a rebuke from the owner, who said that he would rather have\r\nhad his buildings burned down than to have purchased their safety in\r\nsuch a way. Nevertheless the General appreciated Lund's services and the\r\ntwo always remained on friendly terms.\r\n\r\nLund was succeeded by Major George Augustine Washington, son of the\r\nGeneral's brother Charles. From his youth George Augustine had attached\r\nhimself to his uncle's service and fought under him in the Revolution,\r\na part of the time on the staff of Lafayette. The General had a strong\r\naffection for him and in 1784 furnished him with money to take a trip to\r\nthe West Indies for his health. Contrary to expectations, he improved,\r\nmarried Fanny Bassett, and for several years resided at Mount Vernon.\r\nBut the disease, consumption, returned and, greatly to his uncle's\r\ndistress, he died in 1792. Washington helped to care for the widow until\r\nshe became the wife of Tobias Lear.\r\n\r\nTwo other nephews, Robert Lewis and Howell Lewis, were in turn for short\r\nintervals in charge of affairs, but presently the estate was committed\r\nto the care of an Englishman named Anthony Whiting, who was already\r\noverseer of two of the farms. Like his predecessor he was a victim of\r\nconsumption and died in June, 1793. Washington showed him great\r\nkindness, repeatedly urging him not to overexert, to make use of wines,\r\ntea, coffee and other delicacies that had been sent for the use of\r\nguests. As Whiting was also troubled with rheumatism, the President\r\ndropped affairs of state long enough to write him that \"Flannel next the\r\nskin [is] the best cure for, & preventative of the Rheumatism I have\r\never tried.\" Yet after Whiting's death the employer learned that he had\r\nbeen deceived in the man--that he \"drank freely--kept bad company at my\r\nhouse in Alexandria--and was a very debauched person.\"\r\n\r\nWilliam Pearce, who followed Whiting, came from the eastern shore of\r\nMaryland, where he owned an estate called \"Hopewell.\" His salary was a\r\nhundred guineas a year. A poor speller and grammarian, he was\r\nnevertheless practical and one of the best of all the managers. He\r\nresigned in 1797 on account of rheumatism, which he thought would\r\nprevent him from giving business the attention it deserved. Washington\r\nparted from him with much regret and gave him a \"certificate\" in which\r\nhe spoke in the most laudatory terms of his \"honesty, sobriety industry\r\nand skill\" and stated that his conduct had given \"entire satisfaction.\"\r\nThey later corresponded occasionally and exchanged farm and family news\r\nin the most friendly way.\r\n\r\nThe last manager, James Anderson, was described by his employer as \"an\r\nhonest, industrious and judicious Scotchman.\" His salary was one hundred\r\nforty pounds a year. Though born in a country where slaves were unknown,\r\nhe proved adaptable to Virginia conditions and assisted the overseers\r\n\"in some chastisements when needful.\" As his employer retired from the\r\npresidency soon after he took charge he had not the responsibility of\r\nsome who had preceded him, for Washington was unwilling to be reduced to\r\na mere cipher on his own estate. Seeing the great profusion of cheap\r\ncorn and rye, Anderson, who was a good judge of whisky, engaged the\r\nGeneral in a distillery, which stood near the grist mill. The returns\r\nfor 1798 were £344.12.7-3/4, with 755-1/4 gallons still unsold.\r\n\r\nWashington's letters to his managers are filled with exhortations and\r\nsapient advice about all manner of things. He constantly urged them to\r\navoid familiarities with the blacks and preached the importance of\r\n\"example,\" for, \"be it good or bad,\" it \"will be followed by all those\r\nwho look up to you.--Keep every one in their place, & to their duty;\r\nrelaxation from, or neglect in small matters, lead to like attempts in\r\nmatters of greater magnitude.\"\r\n\r\nThe absent owner was constantly complaining that his managers failed to\r\ninform him about matters concerning which he had inquired. Hardly a\r\nreport reached him that did not fail to explain something in which he\r\nwas interested. This was one of the many disadvantages of farming at\r\nlong range.\r\n\r\nIn 1793 Washington described his overseers to Pearce, who was just\r\ntaking charge, in great detail. Stuart is competent, sober and\r\nindustrious, but talkative and conceited. \"If he stirs early and works\r\nlate ... his talkativeness and vanity may be humored.\" Crow is active\r\nand possessed of good judgment, but overly fond of \"visiting and\r\nreceiving visits.\" McKoy is a \"sickly, slothful and stupid fellow.\"\r\nButler, the gardener, may mean well, but \"he has no more authority over\r\nthe Negroes he is placed over than an old woman would have.\" Ultimately\r\nhe dismissed Butler on this ground, but as the man could find no other\r\njob he was forced to give him assistance. The owner's opinions of Davy,\r\nthe colored overseer at Muddy Hole Farm, and of Thomas Green, the\r\ncarpenter, are given elsewhere.\r\n\r\nIn the same letter he exhorted Pearce to see what time the overseers\r\n\"turn out of a morning--for I have strong suspicions that this, with\r\nsome of them, is at a late hour, the consequences of which to the\r\nNegroes is not difficult to foretell. All these Overseers as you will\r\nperceive by their agreements, which I here with send, are on standing\r\nwages; and this with men who are not actuated by the principles of honor\r\nor honesty, and not very regardful of their characters, leads naturally\r\nto endulgences--as _their_ profits whatever may be _mine_, are the same\r\nwhether they are at a horse race or on the farm.\"\r\n\r\nFrom the above it will appear that he did not believe that the overseers\r\nwere storing up any large treasury of good works. In the Revolution he\r\nwrote that one overseer and a confederate, \"I believe, divide the\r\nprofits of my Estate on the York River, tolerably between them, for the\r\ndevil of anything do I get.\" Later he approved the course of George A.\r\nWashington in depriving an overseer of the privilege of killing four\r\nshoats, as this gave him an excuse when caught killing a pig to say that\r\nit was one of those to which he was entitled. Even when honest, the\r\noverseers were likely to be careless. They often knew little about the\r\nstock under their charge and in making their weekly reports would take\r\nthe number from old reports instead of actually making the count, with\r\nthe result that many animals could die or disappear long before those in\r\ncharge became aware of it.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Part of Manger's Weekly Report]\r\n\r\nWashington's carpenters were mostly slaves, but he usually hired a\r\nwhite man to oversee and direct them. In 1768, for example, he engaged\r\nfor this purpose a certain Jonathan Palmer, who was to receive forty\r\npounds a year, four hundred pounds of meat, twenty bushels of corn, a\r\nhouse to live in, a garden, and also the right to keep two cows.\r\n\r\nThe carpenters were required not only to build houses, barns, sheds and\r\nother structures, but also boats, and had to hew out or whipsaw many of\r\nthe timbers and boards used.\r\n\r\nThe carpenter whose name we meet oftenest was Thomas Green, who married\r\nSally Bishop. I have seen a contract signed by Green in 1786, by which\r\nhe was to receive annually forty-five pounds in Virginia currency, five\r\nhundredweight of pork, pasture for a cow, and two hundred pounds of\r\ncommon flour. He also had the right to be absent from the plantation\r\nhalf a day in every month. He did not use these vacations to good\r\nadvantage, for he was a drunken incompetent and tried Washington's\r\npatience sorely. Washington frequently threatened to dismiss him and as\r\noften relented and Green finally, in 1794, quit of his own accord,\r\nthough Washington thereafter had to assist his family.\r\n\r\nThe employment of white day labor at Mount Vernon was not extensive. In\r\nharvest time some extra cradlers were employed, as this was a kind of\r\nwork at which the slaves were not very skilful. Payment was at the rate\r\nof about a dollar a day or a dollar for cutting four acres, which was\r\nthe amount a skilled man could lay down in a day. The men were also\r\ngiven three meals a day and a pint of spirits each. They slept in the\r\nbarns, with straw and a blanket for a bed. With them worked the\r\noverseers, cutting, binding and setting up the sheaves in stools\r\nor shocks.\r\n\r\nLaziness in his employees gave our Farmer a vast deal of unhappiness. It\r\nwas an enemy that he fought longer and more persistently than he fought\r\nthe British. In his early career a certain \"Young Stephens,\" son of the\r\nmiller, seems to have been his greatest trial. \"Visited my Plantations,\"\r\nhe confides to his diary. \"Severely reprimanded young Stephens for his\r\nIndolence, and his father for suffering it.\" \"Visited my Quarters & ye\r\nMill according to custom found young Stephens absent.\" \"Visited my\r\nPlantations and found to my great surprise Stephens constantly at work.\"\r\n\"Rid out to my Plantn. and to my Carpenters. Found Richard Stephens hard\r\nat work with an ax--very extraordinary this!\"\r\n\r\nTo what extent the change proved permanent we do not know. But even\r\nthough the reformation was absolute, it mattered little, for each year\r\nproduces a new crop of lazybones just as it does \"lambs\" and \"suckers.\"\r\n\r\nEnough has been said to show that our Farmer was impatient, perhaps even\r\na bit querulous, but innumerable incidents prove that he was also\r\ngenerous and just. Thus when paper currency depreciated to a low figure\r\nhe, of his own volition, wrote to Lund Washington that he would not hold\r\nhim to his contract, but would pay his wages by a share in the crops,\r\nand this at a time when his own debtors were discharging their\r\nindebtedness in the almost worthless paper.\r\n\r\nIf ever a square man lived, Washington was that man. He believed in the\r\nGolden Rule and he practiced it--not only in church, but in business. It\r\nwas not for nothing that as a boy he had written as his one hundred\r\ntenth \"Rule of Civility\": \"Labor to keep alive in your Breast that\r\nLittle Spark of Celestial fire called Conscience.\"\r\n\r\nIn looking through his later letters I came upon one, dated January 7,\r\n1796, from Pearce stating that Davenport, a miller whom Washington had\r\nbrought from Pennsylvania, was dead. He had already received six\r\nhundred pounds of pork and more wages than were due him as advances for\r\nthe coming year. What should be done? asked the manager. \"His Wife and\r\nChildren will be in a most Distressed Situation.\" As I examined the\r\npapers that followed I said to myself: \"I will see if I know what his\r\nanswer will be.\" I thought I did, and so it proved. Back from\r\nPhiladelphia came the answer:\r\n\r\n\"Altho' she can have no _right_ to the Meat, I would have none of it\r\ntaken from her.--You may also let her have middlings from the Mill,--and\r\nuntil the house may become indispensably necessary for the succeeding\r\nMiller, let her remain in it.--As she went from these parts she can have\r\nno friends (by these I mean relations) where she is. If therefore she\r\nwishes to return back to his, or her own relations, aid her in\r\ndoing so.\"\r\n\r\nNot always were his problems so somber as this. Consider, for example,\r\nthe case of William M. Roberts, an employee who feared that he was about\r\nto get the sack. \"In your absence to Richmond,\" writes anxious William,\r\nNovember 25, 1784, \"My Wife & I have had a Most Unhappy falling out\r\nWhich I Shall not Trouble you with the Praticlers No farther than This.\r\nI hapened To Git to Drinking one Night as She thought Two Much. & From\r\none Cros Question to a nother Matters weare Carred to the Langth it has\r\nbeen. Which Mr. Lund Washington will Inform you For My part I am\r\nHeartily Sorry in my Sole My Wife appares to be the Same & I am of a\r\npinion that We Shall Live More Happy than We have Don for the fewter.\"\r\n\r\nIn his dealings with servants Washington was sometimes troubled with\r\nquestions that worry us when we are trying to hire \"Mary\" or \"Bridget.\"\r\nThus when Mrs. Washington's ill health necessitated his engaging in 1797\r\na housekeeper he made the following minute and anxious inquiries of\r\nBushrod Washington at Richmond concerning a certain Mrs. Forbes:\r\n\r\n\"What countrywoman is she?\r\n\r\n\"Whether Widow or Wife? if the latter\r\n\r\n\"Where her husband is?\r\n\r\n\"What family she has?\r\n\r\n\"What age she is?\r\n\r\n\"Of what temper?\r\n\r\n\"Whether active and spirited in the execution of her business?\r\n\r\n\"Whether sober and honest?\r\n\r\n\"Whether much knowledge in Cookery, and understands ordering and\r\nsetting out a Table?\r\n\r\n\"What her appearance is?\r\n\r\n\"With other matters which may occur to you to ask,--and necessary for me\r\nto know.\r\n\r\n\"Mrs. Forbes will have a warm, decent and comfortable room to herself,\r\nto lodge in, and will eat of the victuals of our Table, but not set at\r\nit, at any time _with us_, be her appearance what it may, for if this\r\nwas _once admitted_, no line satisfactory to either party, perhaps,\r\ncould be drawn thereafter.--It might be well for me to know however\r\nwhether this was admitted at Govr. Brookes or not.\"\r\n\r\nConsiderate and just though he was, his deliberate judgment of servants\r\nafter a long and varied experience was that they are \"necessary\r\nplagues ... they baffle all calculation in the accomplishment of any\r\nplan or repairs they are engaged in; and require more attention to and\r\nlooking after than can be well conceived.\"\r\n\r\nPerhaps the soundest philosophy upon this trying and much debated\r\nservant question is that of Miles Standish, who proceeded, however,\r\nstraightway to violate it.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XII\r\n\r\n\r\nBLACK SLAVES\r\n\r\nIt is one of the strange inconsistencies of history that one of the\r\nforemost champions of liberty of all time should himself have been the\r\nabsolute owner and master of men, women and children.\r\n\r\nVisitors at Mount Vernon saw many faces there, but only a few were white\r\nfaces, the rest were those of black slaves. On each farm stood a village\r\nof wooden huts, where turbaned mammies crooned and piccaninnies gamboled\r\nin the sunshine. The cooks, the house servants, the coachmen, the stable\r\nboys, almost all the manual workers were slaves. Even the Mansion House\r\ngrounds, if the master was away, were apt to be overrun with black\r\nchildren, for though only the progeny of a few house servants were\r\nsupposed to enter the precincts, the others often disregarded the\r\nprohibition, to the destruction of the Farmer's flowers and rare shrubs.\r\n\r\nFrom his father Washington inherited ten or a dozen slaves and, as\r\noccasion required or opportunity offered, he added to the number. By\r\n1760 he paid taxes on forty-nine slaves, in 1770 on eighty-seven and in\r\n1774 on one hundred thirty-five. Presently he found himself overstocked\r\nand in 1778 expressed a wish to barter for land some \"Negroes, of whom I\r\nevery day long more to get clear of[7].\" Still later he declared that he\r\nhad more negroes than could be employed to advantage on his estate, but\r\nwas principled against selling any, while hiring them out was almost as\r\nbad. \"What then is to be done? Something or I shall be ruined.\"\r\n\r\n[7] In 1754 he bought a \"fellow\" for £40.5, another named Jack for £52.5\r\nand a woman called Clio for £50. Two years later he acquired two negro\r\nmen and a woman for £86, and from Governor Dinwiddie a woman and child\r\nfor £60. In 1758 he got Gregory for £60.9. Mount Vernon brought him\r\neighteen more. Mrs. Washington was the owner of a great many slaves,\r\nwhich he called the \"dower Negroes,\" and with part of the money she\r\nbrought him he acquired yet others. The year of his marriage he bought\r\nWill for £50, another fellow for £60, Hannah and child for £80 and nine\r\nothers for £406. In 1762 he acquired two of Fielding Lewis for £115,\r\nseven of Lee Massey for £300, also one-handed Charles for £30. Two years\r\nlater he bought two men and a woman of the estate of Francis Hobbs for\r\n£128.10, the woman being evidently of inferior quality, for she cost\r\nonly £20. Another slave purchased that year from Sarah Alexander was\r\nmore valuable, costing £76. Judy and child, obtained of Garvin Corbin,\r\ncost £63. Two mulattoes, Will and Frank, bought of Mary Lee in 1768,\r\ncost £61.15 and £50, and Will became famous as a body servant; Adam and\r\nFrank, bought of the same owner, cost £38. He bought five more slaves in\r\n1772. Some writers say that this was his last purchase, but it is\r\ncertain that thereafter he at least took a few in payment of debts.\r\n\r\nIn 1786 he took a census of his slaves on the Mount Vernon estate. On\r\nthe Mansion House Farm he had sixty-seven, including Will or Billy Lee,\r\nwho was his \"val de Chambre,\" two waiters, two cooks, three drivers and\r\nstablers, three seamstresses, two house maids, two washers, four\r\nspinners, besides smiths, a waggoner, carter, stock keeper, knitters and\r\ncarpenters. Two women were \"almost past service,\" one of them being \"old\r\nand almost blind.\" A man, Schomberg, was \"past labour.\" Lame Peter had\r\nbeen taught to knit. Twenty-six were children, the youngest being Delia\r\nand Sally. At the mill were Miller Ben and three coopers. On the whole\r\nestate there were two hundred sixteen slaves, including many\r\ndower negroes.\r\n\r\nIf our Farmer took any special pains to develop the mental and moral\r\nnature of \"My People,\" as he usually called his slaves, I have found no\r\nrecord of it. Nor is there any evidence that their sexual relations were\r\nother than promiscuous--if they so desired. Marriage had no legal basis\r\namong slaves and children took the status of their mother. Instances\r\noccurred in which couples remained together and had an affection for\r\ntheir families, but the reverse was not uncommon. This state of affairs\r\ngoes far toward explaining moral lapses among the negroes of to-day.\r\n\r\nI have found only one or two lists of the increase of the slaves, one\r\nbeing that transmitted by James Anderson, manager, in February, 1797, to\r\nthe effect that \"there are 3 Negro Children Born, & one dead--at River\r\nFarm 1; born at Mansion house, Lina 1; at Union Farm 1 born & one\r\ndead--It was killed by Worms. Medical assistance was called--But the\r\nmothers are very inattentive to their Young.\"\r\n\r\nJust why the managers, when they carefully mentioned the arrival of\r\ncalves, colts, lambs and mules, did not also transmit news of the advent\r\nof the more valuable two-legged live stock, is not apparent. In many\r\nreports, however, in accounting for the time of slaves, occur such\r\nentries as: \"By Cornelia in child bed 6 days.\" Occasionally the fact and\r\nsex of the increase is mentioned, but not often.\r\n\r\nWashington was much more likely to take notice of deaths than of\r\nincreases. \"Dorcas, daughter of Phillis, died, which makes 4 Negroes\r\nlost this winter,\" he wrote in 1760. He strove to safeguard the health\r\nof his slaves and employed a physician by the year to attend to them,\r\nthe payment, during part of the time at least, being fifteen pounds per\r\nannum. In 1760 this physician was a certain James Laurie, evidently not\r\na man of exemplary character, for Washington wrote, April 9, 1760,\r\n\"Doctr. Laurie came here. I may add Drunk.\" Another physician was a\r\nDoctor Brown, another Doctor William Rumney, and in later years it was\r\nWashington's old friend Doctor Craik. I have noticed two instances of\r\nWashington's sending slaves considerable distances for medical\r\ntreatment. One boy, Christopher, bitten by a dog, went to a \"specialist\"\r\nat Lebanon, Pennsylvania, for treatment to avert madness, and another,\r\nTom, had an operation performed on his eyes, probably for cataract.\r\n\r\nWhen at home the Farmer personally helped to care for sick slaves. He\r\nhad a special building erected near the Mansion House for use as a\r\nhospital. Once he went to Winchester in the Shenandoah region especially\r\nto look after slaves ill with smallpox \"and found everything in the\r\nutmost confusion, disorder, and backwardness. Got Blankets and every\r\nother requisite from Winchester, and settied things on the best footing\r\nI could.\" As he had had smallpox when at Barbadoes, he had no fear of\r\ncontagion.\r\n\r\nAmong the entries in his diary are: \"Visited my Plantations and found\r\ntwo negroes sick ... ordered them to be blooded.\" \"Found that lightening\r\nhad struck my quarters and near 10 Negroes in it, some very bad but by\r\nletting blood recovered.\" \"Found the new negro Cupid ill of a pleurisy\r\nat Dogue Run Quarter and had him brot home in a cart for better care of\r\nhim.... Cupid extremely ill all this day and night. When I went to bed I\r\nthought him within a few hours of breathing his last.\" However, Cupid\r\nrecovered.\r\n\r\nIn his contracts with overseers Washington stipulated proper care of the\r\nslaves. Once he complained to his manager that the generality of the\r\noverseers seem to \"view the poor creatures in scarcely any other light\r\nthan they do a draught horse or ox; neglecting them as much when they\r\nare unable to work; instead of comforting and nursing them when they lye\r\non a sick bed.\" Again he wrote:\r\n\r\n\"When I recommended care of and attention to my negros in sickness, it\r\nwas that the first stage of, and the whole progress through the\r\ndisorders with which they might be seized (if more than a slight\r\nindisposition) should be closely watched, and timely applications and\r\nremedies be administered; especially in the pleurisies, and all\r\ninflammatory disorders accompanied with pain, when a few day's neglect,\r\nor want of bleeding might render the ailment incurable. In such cases\r\nsweeten'd teas, broths and (according to the nature of the complaint,\r\nand the doctor's prescription) sometimes a little wine, may be necessary\r\nto nourish and restore the patient; and these I am perfectly willing to\r\nallow, when it is requisite.\"\r\n\r\nYet again he complains that the overseers \"seem to consider a Negro much\r\nin the same light as they do the brute beasts, on the farms, and often\r\ntimes treat them as inhumanly.\"\r\n\r\nHis slaves by no means led lives of luxury and inglorious ease. A\r\nfriendly Polish poet who visited Mount Vernon in 1798 was shocked by the\r\npoor quarters and rough food provided for them. He wrote:\r\n\r\n\"We entered some negroes' huts--for their habitations cannot be called\r\nhouses. They are far more miserable than the poorest of the cottages of\r\nour peasants. The husband and his wife sleep on a miserable bed, the\r\nchildren on the floor. A very poor chimney, a little kitchen furniture\r\namid this misery--a tea-kettle and cups.... A small orchard with\r\nvegetables was situated close to the hut. Five or six hens, each with\r\nten or fifteen chickens, walked there. That is the only pleasure allowed\r\nto the negroes: they are not permitted to keep either ducks or geese\r\nor pigs.\"\r\n\r\nYet all the slaves he saw seemed gay and light-hearted and on Sundays\r\nplayed at pitching the bar with an activity and zest that indicated that\r\nthey managed to keep from being overworked and found some enjoyment\r\nin life.\r\n\r\nTo our Farmer's orderly and energetic soul his shiftless lazy blacks\r\nwere a constant trial. In his diary for February, 1760, he records that\r\nfour of his carpenters had only hewed about one hundred twenty feet of\r\ntimber in a day, so he tried the experiment of sitting down and watching\r\nthem. They at once fell to with such energy and worked so rapidly that\r\nhe concluded that each one ought to hew about one hundred twenty-five\r\nfeet per day and more when the days were longer.\r\n\r\nA later set of carpenters seem to have been equally trifling, for of\r\nthem he said in 1795: \"There is not to be found so idle a set of\r\nRascals.--In short, it appears to me, that to make even a chicken coop,\r\nwould employ all of them a week.\"\r\n\r\n\"It is observed by the Weekly Report,\" he wrote when President, \"that\r\nthe Sowers make only Six Shirts a Week, and the last week Caroline\r\n(without being sick) made only five;--Mrs. Washington says their usual\r\ntask was to make nine with Shoulder straps, & good sewing:--tell them\r\ntherefore from me, that what _has_ been done _shall_ be done by fair or\r\nfoul means; & they had better make a choice of the first, for their own\r\nreputation, & for the sake of peace and quietness otherwise they will be\r\nsent to the several Plantations, & be placed at common labor under the\r\nOverseers thereat. Their work ought to be well examined, or it will be\r\nmost shamefully executed, whether little or much of it is done--and it\r\nis said, the same attention ought to be given to Peter (& I suppose to\r\nSarah likewise) or the Stockings will be knit too small for those for\r\nwhom they are intended; such being the idleness, & deceit of\r\nthose people.\"\r\n\r\n\"What kind of sickness is Betty Davis's?\" he demands on another\r\noccasion. \"If pretended ailments, without apparent causes, or visible\r\neffects, will screen her from work, I shall get no work at all from\r\nher;--for a more lazy, deceitful and impudent huzzy is not to be found\r\nin the United States than she is.\"\r\n\r\n\"I observe what you say of Betty Davis &ct,\" he wrote a little later,\r\n\"but I never found so much difficulty as you seem to apprehend in\r\ndistinguishing between _real_ and _feigned_ sickness;--or when a person\r\nis much _afflicted_ with pain.--Nobody can be very sick without having a\r\nfever, nor will a fever or any other disorder continue long upon any one\r\nwithout reducing them.--Pain also, if it be such as to yield entirely to\r\nits force, week after week, will appear by its effects; but my people\r\n(many of them) will lay up a month, at the end of which no visible\r\nchange in their countenance, nor the loss of an oz of flesh, is\r\ndiscoverable; and their allowance of provision is going on as if nothing\r\nailed them.\"\r\n\r\nHe not only deemed his negroes lazy, but he had also a low opinion of\r\ntheir honesty. Alexandria was full of low shopkeepers who would buy\r\nstolen goods from either blacks or whites, and Washington declared that\r\nnot more than two or three of his slaves would refrain from filching\r\nanything upon which they could lay their hands.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Spinning House--Last Building to the Right]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: The Butler's House and Magnolia Set out by Washington the\r\nYear of his Death]\r\n\r\nHe found that he dared not leave his wine unlocked, because the servants\r\nwould steal two glasses to every one consumed by visitors and then\r\nallege that the visitors had drunk it all.\r\n\r\nHe even suspected the slaves of taking a toll from the clover and\r\ntimothy seed given them to sow and adopted the practice of having the\r\nseed mixed with sand, as that rendered it unsalable and also had the\r\nadvantage of getting the seed sown more evenly.\r\n\r\nCorn houses and meat houses had to be kept locked, apples picked early,\r\nand sheep and pigs watched carefully or the slaves took full advantage\r\nof the opportunity. Nor can we at this distant day blame them very much\r\nor wax so indignant as did their master over their thieveries. They were\r\nheld to involuntary servitude and if now and then they got the better of\r\ntheir owner and managed to enjoy a few stolen luxuries they merely did a\r\nlittle toward evening the score. But it was poor training for\r\nfuture freedom.\r\n\r\nThe black picture which Washington draws of slavery--from the master's\r\nstandpoint--is exceedingly interesting and significant. The character\r\nhe gives the slaves is commended to the attention of those persons who\r\ncontinually bemoan the fact that freedom and education have ruined\r\nthe negroes.\r\n\r\nOne of the famous \"Rules of Civility,\" which the boy Washington so\r\ncarefully copied, set forth that persons of high degree ought to treat\r\ntheir inferiors \"with affibility & Courtesie, without Arrogancy.\" There\r\nis abundant evidence that when he came to manhood he was reasonably\r\nconsiderate of his slaves, and yet he was a Master and ruled them in\r\nmartinet fashion. His advice to a manager was to keep the blacks at a\r\nproper distance, \"for they will grow upon familiarity in proportion as\r\nyou will sink in authority.\" The English farmer Parkinson records that\r\nthe first time he walked with General Washington among his negroes he\r\nwas amazed at the rough manner in which he spoke to them. This does not\r\nmean that Washington cursed his negroes as the mate of a Mississippi\r\nRiver boat does his roustabouts, but I suspect that those who have heard\r\nsuch a mate can form an idea of the _tone_ employed by our Farmer that\r\nso shocked Parkinson. Military officers still employ it toward\r\ntheir men.\r\n\r\nCorporal punishment was resorted to on occasion, but not to extremes.\r\nThe Master writes regarding a runaway: \"Let Abram get his deserts when\r\ntaken, by way of example; but do not trust to Crow to give it to\r\nhim;--for I have reason to believe he is swayed more by passion than by\r\njudgment in all his corrections.\" Tradition says that on one occasion he\r\nfound an overseer brutally beating one of the blacks and, indignant at\r\nthe sight, sprang from his horse and, whip in hand, strode up to the\r\noverseer, who was so affrighted that he backed away crying loudly:\r\n\"Remember your character, General, remember your character!\" The General\r\npaused, reprimanded the overseer for cruelty and rode off.\r\n\r\nAmong his slaves were some that were too unruly to be managed by\r\nordinary means. In the early seventies he had such a one on a plantation\r\nin York County, Will Shag by name, who was a persistent runaway, and who\r\nwhipped the overseer and was obstreperous generally. Another slave\r\ncommitted so serious an offense that he was tried under state law and\r\n>vas executed. When a bondman became particularly fractious he was\r\nthreatened with being sent to the West Indies, a place held in as much\r\ndread as was \"down the river\" in later years. In 1766 Washington sent\r\nsuch a fellow off and to the captain of the ship that carried the slave\r\naway he wrote:\r\n\r\n\"With this letter comes a negro (Tom) which I beg the favor of you to\r\nsell in any of the islands you may go to, for whatever he will fetch,\r\nand bring me in return for him\r\n\r\n\"One hhd of best molasses\r\n\r\n\"One ditto of best rum\r\n\r\n\"One barrel of lymes, if good and cheap\r\n\r\n\"One pot of tamarinds, containing about 10 lbs.\r\n\r\n\"Two small ditto of mixed sweetmeats, about 5 lbs. each. And the\r\nresidue, much or little, in good old spirits. That this fellow is both a\r\nrogue and a runaway (tho he was by no means remarkable for the former,\r\nand never practiced the latter till of late) I shall not pretend to\r\ndeny. But that he is exceedingly healthy, strong, and good at the hoe,\r\nthe whole neighborhood can testify, and particularly Mr. Johnson and his\r\nson, who have both had him under them as foreman of the gang; which\r\ngives me reason to hope that he may with your good management sell well,\r\nif kept clean and trim'd up a little when offered for sale.\"\r\n\r\nAnother \"misbehaving fellow\" named Waggoner Jack was sent off in 1791\r\nand was sold for \"one pipe and Quarter Cask\" of wine. Somewhat later\r\n(1793) Matilda's Ben became addicted to evil courses and among other\r\nthings committed an assault and battery on Sambo, for which he received\r\ncorporal punishment duly approved by our Farmer, whose earnest desire it\r\nwas \"that quarrels be stopped.\" Evidently the remedy was insufficient,\r\nfor not long after the absent owner wrote:\r\n\r\n\"I am very sorry that so likely a fellow as Matilda's Ben should addict\r\nhimself to such courses as he is pursuing. If he should be guilty of any\r\natrocious crime that would affect his life, he might be given up to the\r\ncivil authority for trial; but for such offenses as most of his color\r\nare guilty of, you had better try further correction, accompanied by\r\nadmonition and advice. The two latter sometimes succeed where the first\r\nhas failed. He, his father and mother (who I dare say are his receivers)\r\nmay be told in explicit language, that if a stop is not put to his\r\nrogueries and other villainies, by fair means and shortly, that I will\r\nship him off (as I did Waggoner Jack) for the West Indies, where he will\r\nhave no opportunity of playing such pranks as he is at present\r\nengaged in.\"\r\n\r\nA few of the negroes occupied positions of some trust and\r\nresponsibility. One named Davy was for many years manager of Muddy Hole\r\nFarm, and Washington thought that he carried on his work as well as did\r\nthe white overseers and more quietly than some, though rather negligent\r\nof live stock. Each year at killing time he was allowed two or three\r\nhundredweight of pork as well as other privileges not accorded to the\r\nordinary slave. Still his master did not entirely trust him, for in 1795\r\nwe find that Washington suspected Davy of having stolen some lambs that\r\nhad been reported as \"lost.\"\r\n\r\nThe most famous of the Mount Vernon negroes was William Lee, better\r\nknown as Billy, whose purchase from Mary Lee has already been noticed.\r\nBilly was Washington's valet and huntsman and served with him throughout\r\nthe Revolution as a body servant, rode with him at reviews and was\r\npainted by Savage in the well-known group of the President and his\r\nfamily. Naturally Billy put on airs and presumed a good deal upon his\r\nposition. On one occasion at Monmouth the General and his staff were\r\nreconnoitering the British, and Billy and fellow valets gathered on an\r\nadjoining hill beneath a sycamore tree whence Billy, telescope in hand,\r\nsurveyed the enemy with much importance and interest. Washington, with a\r\nsmile, called the attention of his aides to the spectacle. About the\r\nsame time the British, noticing the group of horsemen and unable to\r\ndistinguish the color of the riders, paid their respects to Billy and\r\nhis followers in the shape of a solid shot, which went crashing through\r\nthe top of the tree, whereupon there was a rapid recession of coat tails\r\ntoward the rear.\r\n\r\nBilly was a good and faithful servant and his master appreciated the\r\nfact. In 1784 we find Washington writing to his Philadelphia agent: \"The\r\nmullatto fellow, William, who has been with me all the war, is attached\r\n(married he says) to one of his own color, a free woman, who during the\r\nwar, was also of my family. She has been in an infirm condition for some\r\ntime, and I had conceived that the connexion between them had ceased;\r\nbut I am mistaken it seems; they are both applying to get her here, and\r\ntho' I never wished to see her more, I can not refuse his request (if it\r\ncan be complied with on reasonable terms) as he has served me faithfully\r\nfor many years. After premising this much, I have to beg the favor of\r\nyou to procure her a passage to Alexandria.\"\r\n\r\nNext year while Billy and his master were engaged in surveying a piece\r\nof ground he fell and broke his knee pan, with the result that he was\r\ncrippled ever after. When Washington started to New York in 1789 to be\r\ninaugurated Billy insisted upon accompanying him, but gave out on the\r\nway and was left at Philadelphia. A little later, by the President's\r\ndirection, Lear wrote to return Billy to Mount Vernon, \"for he cannot be\r\nof any service here, and perhaps will require a person to attend upon\r\nhim constantly ... but if he is still anxious to come on here the\r\nPresident would gratify him, altho' he will be troublesome--He has been\r\nan old and faithful Servant, this is enough for the President to gratify\r\nhim in every reasonable wish.\"\r\n\r\nWhen Billy was at Mount Vernon he worked as a shoemaker. He kept careful\r\nnote of visitors to the place and if one arrived who had served in the\r\nRevolution he invariably received a summons to visit the old negro and\r\nas invariably complied. Then would ensue a talk of war experiences which\r\nboth would enjoy, for between those who had experienced the cold at\r\nValley Forge and the warmth of Monmouth there were ties that reached\r\nbeyond the narrow confines of caste and color. And upon departure the\r\nvisitor would leave a coin in Billy's not unwilling palm.\r\n\r\nAs later noted in detail, Washington made special provision for Billy\r\nin his will, and for years the old negro lived upon his annuity. He was\r\nmuch addicted to drink and now and then, alas, had attacks in which he\r\nsaw things that were not. On such occasions it was customary to send for\r\nanother mulatto named Westford, who would relieve him by letting a\r\nlittle blood. There came a day when Westford arrived and proceeded to\r\nperform his customary office, but the blood refused to flow. Billy\r\nwas dead.\r\n\r\nWashington's kindness to Billy was more or less paralleled by his\r\ntreatment of other servants. Even when President he would write letters\r\nfor his slaves to their wives and \"Tel Bosos\" and would inclose them\r\nwith his own letters to Mount Vernon. He appreciated the fact that\r\nslaves were capable of human feelings like other men and in 1787, when\r\ntrying to purchase a mason, he instructed his agent not to buy if by so\r\ndoing he would \"hurt the man's feelings\" by breaking family ties. Even\r\nwhen dying, noting black Cristopher by his bed, he directed him to sit\r\ndown and rest. It was a little thing, but kindness is largely made up of\r\nlittle things.\r\n\r\nThe course taken by him in training a personal servant is indicated by\r\nsome passages from his correspondence. Writing from the Capital to\r\nPearce, December, 1795, regarding a young negro, Washington says:\r\n\r\n\"If Cyrus continues to give evidence of such qualities as would fit him\r\nfor a waiting man, encourage him to persevere in them; and if they\r\nshould appear to be sincere and permanent, I will receive him in that\r\ncharacter when I retire from public life if not sooner.--To be sober,\r\nattentive to his duty, honest, obliging and cleanly, are the\r\nqualifications necessary to fit him for my purposes.--If he possess\r\nthese, or can acquire them--he might become useful to me, at the same\r\ntime that he would exalt, and benefit himself.\"\r\n\r\n\"I would have you again stir up the pride of Cyrus,\" he wrote the next\r\nMay, \"that he may be the fitter for my purposes against I come home;\r\nsometime before which (that is as soon as I shall be able to fix on\r\ntime) I will direct him to be taken into the house, and clothes to be\r\nmade for him.--In the meanwhile, get him a strong horn comb and direct\r\nhim to keep his head well combed, that the hair, or wool may grow long.\"\r\n\r\nOnce when President word reached his ears that he was being criticized\r\nfor not furnishing his slaves with sufficient food. He hurriedly\r\ndirected that the amount should be increased and added: \"I will not\r\nhave my feelings hurt with complaints of this sort, nor lye under the\r\nimputation of starving my negros, and thereby driving them to the\r\nnecessity of thieving to supply the deficiency. To prevent waste or\r\nembezzlement is the only inducement to allowancing them at all--for if,\r\ninstead of a peck they could eat a bushel of meal a week fairly, and\r\nrequired it, I would not withold or begrudge it them.\"\r\n\r\nThere is good reason to believe that Washington was respected and even\r\nbeloved by many of his \"People.\" Colonel Humphreys, who was long at\r\nMount Vernon arranging the General's papers, wrote descriptive of the\r\nreturn at the close of the Revolution:\r\n\r\n     \"When that foul stain of manhood, slavery, flowed,\r\n     Through Afric's sons transmitted in the blood;\r\n     Hereditary slaves his kindness shar'd,\r\n     For manumission by degrees prepared:\r\n     Return'd from war, I saw them round him press\r\n     And all their speechless glee by artless signs express.\"\r\n\r\nOn the whole we must conclude that the lot of the Mount Vernon slaves\r\nwas a reasonably happy one. The regulations to which they had to conform\r\nwere rigorous. Their Master strove to keep them at work and to prevent\r\nthem from \"night walking,\" that is running about at night visiting.\r\nTheir work was rough, and even the women were expected to labor in the\r\nfields plowing, grubbing and hauling manure as if they were men. But\r\nthey had rations of corn meal, salt pork and salt fish, whisky and rum\r\nat Christmas, chickens and vegetables raised by themselves and now and\r\nthen a toothsome pig sequestered from the Master's herd. When the annual\r\nraces were held at Alexandria they were permitted to go out into the\r\nworld and gaze and gabble to their heart's content. And, not least of\r\nall, an inscrutable Providence had vouchsafed to Ham one great\r\ncompensation that whatever his fortune or station he should usually be\r\ncheerful. The negro has not that \"sad lucidity of mind\" that curses his\r\nwhite cousin and leads to general mental wretchedness and suicide.\r\n\r\nSome of the Mount Vernon slaves were of course more favored than were\r\nothers. The domestic and personal servants lived lives of culture and\r\ninglorious ease compared with those of the field hands. They formed the\r\naristocracy of colored Mount Vernon society and gave themselves airs\r\naccordingly.\r\n\r\nNominally our Farmer's slaves were probably all Christians, though I\r\nhave found no mention in his papers of their spiritual state. But\r\ntradition says that some of them at Dogue Run at least were Voudoo or\r\n\"conjuring\" negroes.\r\n\r\nWashington owned slaves and lived his life under the institution of\r\nslavery, but he loved it not. He was too honest and keen-minded not to\r\nrealize that the institution did not square with the principles of human\r\nliberty for which he had fought, and yet the problem of slavery was so\r\nvast and complicated that he was puzzled how to deal with it. But as\r\nearly as 1786 he wrote to John F. Mercer, of Virginia: \"I never mean,\r\nunless some particular circumstances should compel me to it, to possess\r\nanother slave by purchase, it being among my _first_ wishes to see some\r\nplan adopted by which slavery in this country may be abolished by law.\"\r\nThe running away of his colored cook a decade later subjected him to\r\nsuch trials that he wrote that he would probably have to break his\r\nresolution. He did, in fact, carry on considerable correspondence to\r\nthat end and seems to have taken one man on trial, but I have found no\r\nevidence that he discovered a negro that suited him.\r\n\r\nIn 1794, in explaining to Tobias Lear his reasons for desiring to sell\r\nsome of his western lands, he said: \"_Besides these I have another\r\nmotive which_ makes me earnestly wish for these things--it is indeed\r\nmore powerful than all the rest--namely to liberate a certain species of\r\nproperty which I possess very repugnantly to my own feelings; but which\r\nimperious necessity compels, and until I can substitute some other\r\nexpedient, by which expenses, not in my power to avoid (however well I\r\nmay be disposed to do it) can be defrayed.\"\r\n\r\nLater in the same year he wrote to General Alexander Spotswood: \"With\r\nrespect to the other species of property, concerning which you ask my\r\nopinion, I shall frankly declare to you that I do not like even to\r\nthink, much less to talk of it.--However, as you have put the question,\r\nI shall, in a few words, give _my ideas_ about it.--Were it not then,\r\nthat I am principled agt. selling negroes, as you would cattle at a\r\nmarket, I would not in twelve months from this date, be possessed of one\r\nas a slave.--I shall be happily mistaken, if they are not found to be a\r\nvery troublesome species of property ere many years pass over\r\nour heads.\"\r\n\r\n\"I wish from my soul that the Legislature of the State could see the\r\npolicy of a gradual abolition of slavery,\" he wrote to Lawrence Lewis\r\nthree years later. \"It might prevent much future mischief.\"\r\n\r\nHis ideas on the subject were in accord with those of many other great\r\nSoutherners of his day such as Madison and Jefferson. These men realized\r\nthe inconsistency of slavery in a republic dedicated to the proposition\r\nthat all men are created equal, and vaguely they foresaw the\r\nirrepressible conflict that was to divide their country and was to be\r\nfought out on a hundred bloody battle-fields. They did not attempt to\r\ndefend slavery as other than a temporary institution to be eliminated\r\nwhenever means and methods could be found to do it. Not until the cotton\r\ngin had made slavery more profitable and radical abolitionism arose in\r\nthe North did Southerners of prominence begin to champion slavery as\r\npraiseworthy and permanent.\r\n\r\nAnd yet, though Washington in later life deplored slavery, he was human\r\nand illogical enough to dislike losing his negroes and pursued runaways\r\nwith energy. In October, 1760, he spent seven shillings in advertising\r\nfor an absconder, and the next year paid a minister named Green four\r\npounds for taking up a runaway. In 1766 he advertised rewards for the\r\ncapture of \"Negro Tom,\" evidently the man he later sold in the West\r\nIndies. The return of Henry in 1771 cost him £1.16. Several slaves were\r\ncarried away by the British during the Revolution and seem never to have\r\nbeen recovered, though the treaty of peace provided for the return of\r\nsuch slaves, and Washington made inquiries concerning them. In 1796,\r\napropos of a girl who had absconded to New England, he excused his\r\ndesire to recapture her on the ground that as long as slavery was in\r\nexistence it was hardly fair to allow some to escape and to hold others.\r\n\r\nA rather peculiar situation arose in 1791 with regard to some of his\r\n\"People,\" His attorney general, Randolph, had taken some slaves to\r\nPhiladelphia, and the blacks took advantage of the fact that under\r\nPennsylvania law they could not be forced to leave the state against\r\ntheir will. Fearing that some of his own servants might do likewise,\r\nWashington directed Lear to get the slaves back to Mount Vernon and to\r\naccomplish it \"under pretext that may deceive both them and the Public,\"\r\nwhich goes to show that even George Washington had some of the guile of\r\nthe serpent.\r\n\r\nDuring this period he was loath to bring the fact that he was a\r\nslaveholder too prominently before the public, for he realized the\r\nprejudice already existing against the institution in the North. When\r\none of his men absconded in 1795 he gave instructions not to let his\r\nname appear in any advertisement of the runaway, at least not north\r\nof Virginia.\r\n\r\nHis final judgment on slavery is expressed in his will. \"Upon the\r\ndecease of my wife it is my will and desire,\" he wrote, \"that all the\r\nslaves which I hold _in my own right_ shall receive their freedom--To\r\nemancipate them during her life, would tho earnestly wished by me, be\r\nattended with such insuperable difficulties, on account of their\r\nintermixture by marriages with the Dower negroes as to excite the most\r\npainful sensations,--if not disagreeable consequences from the latter,\r\nwhile both descriptions are in the occupancy of the same proprietor, it\r\nnot being in my power under the tenure by which the dower Negroes are\r\nheld to manumit them.\"\r\n\r\nThe number of his own slaves at the time of his death was one hundred\r\ntwenty-four. Of dower negroes there were one hundred fifty-three, and\r\nbesides he had forty leased from a Mrs. French.\r\n\r\nHe expressly forbade the sale of any slave or his transportation out of\r\nVirginia, and made provision for the care of the aged, the young and\r\nthe infirm. He gave immediate freedom to his mulatto man, calling\r\nhimself William Lee, or if he should prefer it, being physically\r\nincapacitated, he might remain in slavery. In either case he was to have\r\nan annuity of thirty dollars and the \"victuals and cloaths he has been\r\naccustomed to receive.\" \"This I give him as a testimony of my sense of\r\nhis attachment to me and for his faithful services during the\r\nrevolutionary War.\"\r\n\r\nAs a matter of fact, Mrs. Washington preferred to free her own and the\r\nGeneral's negroes as soon as possible and it was accordingly done before\r\nher death, which occurred in 1802.\r\n\r\nOne of the servants thus freed, by name Cary, lived to the alleged age\r\nof one hundred fourteen years and finally died in Washington City. He\r\nwas a personage of considerable importance among the colored population\r\nof the Capital, and on Fourth of July and other parades would always\r\nappear in an old military coat, cocked hat and huge cockade presented by\r\nhis Master. His funeral was largely attended even by white persons.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIII\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE FARMER'S WIFE\r\n\r\nMartha Dandridge's first husband was a man much older than herself and\r\nher second was almost a year younger. Before she embarked upon her\r\nsecond matrimonial venture she had been the mother of four children, and\r\nhaving lost two of these, her husband, her father and mother, she had\r\nknown, though only twenty-seven, most of the vital experiences that life\r\ncan give. Perhaps it was well, for thereby she was better fitted to be\r\nthe mate of a man sober and sedate in disposition and created by Nature\r\nto bear heavy burdens of responsibility.\r\n\r\nIn view of the important places her husband filled, it is astonishing\r\nhow little we really know of her. Washington occasionally refers to her\r\nin his letters and diaries, but usually in an impersonal way that gives\r\nus little insight into her character or activities. She purposely\r\ndestroyed almost all the correspondence that passed between her and her\r\nhusband and very little else remains that she wrote. From the few\r\nletters that do survive it is apparent that her education was slender,\r\nthough no more so than that of most women of her day even in the upper\r\nclass. She had a fondness for phonetic spelling, and her verbs and\r\nsubjects often indulged in family wrangles. She seems to have been\r\nconscious of her deficiencies in this direction or at least to have\r\ndisliked writing, for not infrequently the General acted as her\r\namanuensis. But she was well trained in social and domestic\r\naccomplishments, could dance and play on the spinet--in short, was\r\nbrought up a \"gentlewoman.\" That she must in youth have possessed charm\r\nof person and manners is indicated by her subjugation of Daniel Parke\r\nCustis, a man of the world and of much greater fortune than herself, and\r\nby her later conquest of Washington, for, though it be admitted in the\r\nlatter case that George may not have objected to her fortune, we can not\r\nescape the conclusion that he truly loved her.\r\n\r\nIn fact, the match seems to have been ideally successful in every\r\nrespect except one. The contracting parties remained reasonably devoted\r\nto each other until the end and though tradition says that Martha would\r\nsometimes read George a curtain lecture after they had retired from\r\ncompany, there remains no record of any serious disagreement. Though not\r\nbrilliant nor possessed of a profound mind, she was a woman of much good\r\nsense with an understanding heart. Nor did she lack firmness or public\r\nspirit. Edmund Pendleton relates that when on his way to the Continental\r\nCongress in 1774 he stopped at Mount Vernon, \"She talked like a Spartan\r\nmother to her son on going to battle. 'I hope you will all stand firm--I\r\nknow George will,' she said.\"\r\n\r\nThe poorest artisan in Boston with nothing to lose but his life did not\r\nembrace the patriot cause with any greater eagerness than did these\r\nWashingtons with their broad acres and thousands of pounds on bond.\r\n\r\nThere is every reason to believe that Martha Washington was helpful to\r\nher husband in many ways. At home she was a good housewife and when\r\nWashington was in public life she played her part well. No brilliant\r\nsallies of wit spoken by her on any occasion have come down to us, but\r\nwe know that at Valley Forge she worked day and night knitting socks,\r\npatching garments and making shirts for the loyal band of winter\r\npatriots who stood by their leader and their cause in the darkest hour\r\nof the Revolution.\r\n\r\nA Norristown lady who paid her a call in the little stone house that\r\nstill stands beside the Schuylkill relates that \"as she was said to be\r\nso grand a lady, we thought we must put on our best bibs and bands. So\r\nwe dressed ourselves in our most elegant ruffles and silks, and were\r\nintroduced to her ladyship. And don't you think we found her _knitting\r\nwith a specked apron on!_ She received us very graciously, and easily,\r\nbut after the compliments were over, she resumed her knitting.\"\r\n\r\nBut the marriage was a failure in that there were no children. No doubt\r\nboth wanted them, for Washington was fond of young people and many\r\nanecdotes are handed down of his interest in little tots. Some one has\r\nremarked that he was deprived of offspring in order that he might become\r\nthe Father of His Country.\r\n\r\nToward those near and dear to her Martha Washington was almost foolishly\r\naffectionate. In one of her letters she tells of a visit \"in\r\nWestmoreland whare I spent a weak very agreabley. I carred my little\r\npatt with me and left Jackey at home for a trial to see how well I coud\r\nstay without him though we ware gon but won fortnight I was quite\r\nimpatiant to get home. If I at aney time heard the doggs barke or a\r\nnoise out, I thought thair was a person sent for me. I often fancied he\r\nwas sick or some accident had happened to him so that I think it is\r\nimpossible for me to leave him as long as Mr. Washington must stay when\r\nhe comes down.\"\r\n\r\nAny parent who has been absent from home under similar circumstances and\r\nwho has imagined the infinite variety of dreadful things that might\r\nbefall a loved child will sympathize with the mother's heart--in spite\r\nof the poor spelling!\r\n\r\nPatty Custis was an amiable and beautiful girl who when she grew up came\r\nto be called \"the dark lady.\" But she was delicate in health. Some\r\nwriters have said that she had consumption, but as her stepfather\r\nrepeatedly called it \"Fits,\" I think it is certain that it was some form\r\nof epilepsy. Her parents did everything possible to restore her, but in\r\nvain. Once they took her to Bath, now Berkeley Springs, for several\r\nweeks and the expenses of that journey we find all duly set down by\r\nColonel Washington in the proper place. As Paul Leicester Ford remarks,\r\nsome of the remedies tried savored of quackery. In the diary, for\r\nFebruary 16, 1770, we learn that \"Joshua Evans who came here last Night\r\nput an iron Ring upon Patey and went away after Breakfast.\" Perhaps\r\nEvans failed to make the ring after the old medieval rule from three\r\nnails or screws that had been taken from a disinterred coffin. At any\r\nrate the ring did poor Patty little good and a year later \"Mr. Jno.\r\nJohnson who has a nostrum for Fits came here in the afternoon.\" In the\r\nspring of 1773 the dark lady died.\r\n\r\nHer death added considerably to Washington's possessions, but there is\r\nevery evidence that he gave no thought to that aspect of the matter.\r\n\"Her delicate health, or perhaps her fond affection for the only father\r\nshe had ever known, so endeared her to the 'general', that he knelt at\r\nher dying bed, and with a passionate burst of tears prayed aloud that\r\nher life might be spared, unconscious that even then her spirit had\r\ndeparted.\" The next day he wrote to his brother-in-law: \"It is an easier\r\nmatter to conceive than describe the distress of this Family: especially\r\nthat of the unhappy Parent of our Dear Patey Custis, when I inform you\r\nthat yesterday removed the Sweet Innocent Girl [who] Entered into a more\r\nhappy & peaceful abode than any she has met with in the afflicted Path\r\nshe hitherto has trod.\"\r\n\r\nBefore this John Parke Custis, or \"Jacky,\" had given his stepfather\r\nconsiderable anxiety. Jacky's mind turned chiefly from study to dogs,\r\nhorses and guns and, in an effort, to \"make him fit for more useful\r\npurposes than horse races,\" Washington put him under the tutorship of an\r\nAnglican clergyman named Jonathan Boucher, who endeavored to instruct\r\nsome of the other gilded Virginia youths of his day. But Latin and Greek\r\nwere far less interesting to the boy than the pretty eyes of Eleanor\r\nCalvert and the two entered into a clandestine engagement. In all\r\nrespects save one the match was eminently satisfactory, for the Calvert\r\nfamily, being descended from Lord Baltimore, was as good as any in\r\nAmerica, and Miss Nelly's amiable qualities, wrote Washington, had\r\nendeared her to her prospective relations, but both were very young,\r\nJack being about seventeen, and the girl still younger. While consenting\r\nto the match, therefore, Washington insisted that its consummation\r\nshould be postponed for two years and packed the boy off to King's\r\nCollege, now Columbia. But Martha Washington was a fond and doting\r\nmother and, as Patty's death occurred almost immediately, Jack's absence\r\nin distant New York was more than she could bear. He was, therefore,\r\nallowed to return home in three months instead of two years, and in\r\nFebruary, 1774, was wedded to the girl of his choice. Mrs. Washington\r\nfelt the loss of her daughter too keenly to attend, but sent this\r\nmessage by her husband:\r\n\r\n\"MY DEAR NELLY.--God took from me a Daughter when June Roses were\r\nblooming--He has now given me another Daughter about her Age when Winter\r\nwinds are blowing, to warm my Heart again. I am as Happy as One so\r\nAfflicted and so Blest can be. Pray receive my Benediction and a wish\r\nthat you may long live the Loving Wife of my happy Son, and a Loving\r\nDaughter of\r\n\r\n\"Your affectionate Mother,\r\n\r\n\"M. WASHINGTON.\"\r\n\r\nThe marriage, it may be added here, sobered John Custis. He and his\r\nbride established themselves at Abingdon on the Potomac, not far from\r\nMount Vernon, and with their little ones were often visitors, especially\r\nwhen the General was away to the war and Mrs. Washington was alone.\r\nToward the close of the war Jack himself entered the army, rose to the\r\nrank of colonel and died of fever contracted in the siege of Yorktown.\r\nThus again was the mother's heart made sorrowful, nor did the General\r\nhimself accept the loss unmoved. He at once adopted the two youngest\r\nchildren, Eleanor and George Washington Parke, and brought them up in\r\nhis own family.\r\n\r\nEleanor Custis, or \"Nelly,\" as she was affectionately called, grew up a\r\njoyous, beautiful cultured girl, who won the hearts of all who saw her.\r\nThe Polish poet, Julian Niemcewicz, who visited Mount Vernon in 1798,\r\nwrote of her as \"the divine Miss Custis.... She was one of those\r\ncelestial beings so rarely produced by nature, sometimes dreamt of by\r\npoets and painters, which one cannot see without a feeling of ecstacy.\"\r\nAs already stated, she married the General's nephew, Lawrence Lewis. In\r\nSeptember, 1799, Washington told the pair that they might build a house\r\non Grey's Heights on the Dogue Run Farm and rent the farm, \"by all odds\r\nthe best and most productive I possess,\" promising that on his death the\r\nplace should go to them. Death came before the house was built, but\r\nlater the pair erected on the Heights \"Woodlawn,\" one of the most\r\nbeautiful and pretentious places in Fairfax County.\r\n\r\nGeorge Washington Parke Custis grew up much such a boy as his father\r\nwas. He took few matters seriously and neglected the educational\r\nopportunities thrown in his way. Washington said of him that \"from his\r\ninfancy I have discovered an almost unconquerable disposition to\r\nindolence in everything that did not tend to his amusements.\" But he\r\nloved the boy, nevertheless, and late in life Custis confessed, \"we have\r\nseen him shed tears of parental solicitude over the manifold errors and\r\nfollies of our unworthy youth.\" The boy had a good heart, however, and\r\nif he was the source of worry to the great man during the great man's\r\nlife, he at least did what he could to keep the great man's memory\r\ngreen. He wrote a book of recollections full of filial affection and\r\nLatin phrases and painted innumerable war pictures in which Washington\r\nwas always in the foreground on a white horse \"with the British\r\nstreaking it.\" Washington bequeathed to him a square in the City of\r\nWashington and twelve hundred acres on Four Mile Run in the vicinity of\r\nAlexandria. Upon land near by inherited from his father Custis built the\r\nfamous Arlington mansion, almost ruining himself financially in doing\r\nso. Upon his death the estate fell to his daughter, Mrs. Robert E. Lee,\r\nand it is now our greatest national cemetery.\r\n\r\nMrs. Washington not only managed the Mount Vernon household, but she\r\nlooked after the spinning of yarn, the weaving of cloth and the making\r\nof clothing for the family and for the great horde of slaves. At times,\r\nparticularly during the Revolution and the non-importation days that\r\npreceded it, she had as many as sixteen spinning-wheels in operation at\r\nonce. The work was done in a special spinning house, which was well\r\nequipped with looms, wheels, reels, flaxbrakes and other machinery. Most\r\nof the raw material, such as wool and flax and sometimes even cotton,\r\nwas produced upon the place and never left it until made up into the\r\nfinished product.\r\n\r\nIn 1768 the white man and five negro girls employed in the work produced\r\n815-3/4 yards of linen, 365-1/4 yards of woolen cloth, 144 yards of\r\nlinsey and 40 yards of cotton cloth. With his usual pains Washington\r\nmade a comparative statement of the cost of this cloth produced at home\r\nand what it would have cost him if it had been purchased in England, and\r\ncame to the conclusion that only £23.19.11 would be left to defray the\r\nexpense of spinning, hire of the six persons engaged, \"cloathing,\r\nvictualling, wheels, &c.\" Still the work was kept going.\r\n\r\nA great variety of fabrics were produced: \"striped woolen, wool plaided,\r\ncotton striped, linen, wool-birdseye, cotton filled with wool, linsey,\r\nM's and O's, cotton Indian dimity, cotton jump stripe, linen filled with\r\ntow, cotton striped with silk, Roman M., janes twilled, huccabac,\r\nbroadcloth, counter-pain, birdseye diaper, Kirsey wool, barragon,\r\nfustian, bed-ticking, herring-box, and shalloon.\"\r\n\r\nIn non-importation days Mrs. Washington even made the cloth for two of\r\nher own gowns, using cotton striped with silk, the latter being obtained\r\nfrom the ravellings of brown silk stockings and crimson damask\r\nchair covers.\r\n\r\nThe housewife believed in good cheer and an abundance of it, and the\r\nlarders at Mount Vernon were kept well filled. Once the General\r\nprotested to Lund Washington because so many hogs had been killed,\r\nwhereupon the manager replied that when he put up the meat he had\r\nexpected that Mrs. Washington would have been at home and that he knew\r\nthere would be need for it because her \"charitable disposition is in\r\nthe same proportion as her meat house.\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Weekly Report on the Work of the Spinners]\r\n\r\nShe had a swarm of relatives by blood and marriage and they visited her\r\nlong and often. The Burwells, the Bassetts, the Dandridges and all the\r\nrest came so frequently that hardly a week passed that at least one of\r\nthem did not sleep beneath the hospitable roof. Even her stepmother paid\r\nher many visits and, what is more, was strongly urged by the General to\r\nmake the place her permanent home. When Mrs. Washington was at home\r\nduring the Revolution her son and her daughter-in-law spent most of\r\ntheir time there. After the Revolution her two youngest grandchildren\r\nresided at Mount Vernon, and the two older ones, Elizabeth and Martha,\r\nwere often there, as was their mother, who married as her second husband\r\nDoctor Stuart, a man whom Washington highly esteemed.\r\n\r\nIt would be foolish to deny that Mrs. Washington did not take pleasure\r\nin the honors heaped upon her husband or that she did not enjoy the\r\nconsideration that accrued to her as First Lady of the Land. Yet public\r\nlife at times palled upon her and she often spoke of the years of the\r\npresidency as her \"lost days.\" New York and Philadelphia, she said,\r\nwere \"not home, only a sojourning. The General and I feel like children\r\njust released from school or from a hard taskmaster.... How many dear\r\nfriends I have left behind! They fill my memory with sweet thoughts.\r\nShall I ever see them again? Not likely unless they come to me, for the\r\ntwilight is gathering around our lives. I am again fairly settled down\r\nto the pleasant duties of an old-fashioned Virginia-housekeeper, steady\r\nas a clock, busy as a bee, and cheerful as a cricket.\"\r\n\r\nThat she did not overdraw her account of her industry is borne out by a\r\nMrs. Carrington, who, with her husband, one of the General's old\r\nofficers, visited Mount Vernon about this time. She wrote:\r\n\r\n\"Let us repair to the Old Lady's room, which is precisely in the style\r\nof our good old Aunt's--that is to say, nicely fixed for all sorts of\r\nwork--On one side sits the chambermaid, with her knitting--on the other,\r\na little colored pet learning to sew, an old decent woman, with her\r\ntable and shears, cutting out the negroes' winter clothes, while the\r\ngood old lady directs them all, incessantly knitting herself and\r\npointing out to me several pair of nice colored stockings and gloves she\r\nhad just finished, and presenting me with a pair half done, which she\r\nbegs I will finish and wear for her. Her netting too is a great source\r\nof amusement and is so neatly done that all the family are proud of\r\ntrimming their dresses with it.\"\r\n\r\nThis domestic life was dear to the heart of our Farmer's wife, yet the\r\nhome-coming did not fail to awaken some melancholy memories. To Mrs.\r\nGeorge Fairfax in England she wrote, or rather her husband wrote for\r\nher: \"The changes which have taken place in this country since you left\r\nit (and it is pretty much the case in all other parts of this State)\r\nare, in one word, total. In Alexandria, I do not believe there lives at\r\nthis day a single family with whom you had the smallest acquaintance. In\r\nour neighborhood Colo. Mason, Colo. McCarty and wife, Mr. Chickester,\r\nMr. Lund Washington and all the Wageners, have left the stage of human\r\nlife; and our visitors on the Maryland side are gone and going\r\nlikewise.\"\r\n\r\nHow many people have had like thoughts! One of the many sad things about\r\nbeing the \"last leaf upon the tree\" is having to watch the other leaves\r\nshrivel and drop off and to be left at last in utter loneliness.\r\n\r\nLike her husband, Mrs. Washington was an early riser, and it was a habit\r\nshe seems to have kept up until the end. She rose with the sun and\r\nafter breakfast invariably retired to her room for an hour of prayer and\r\nreading the Scriptures. Her devotions over she proceeded with the\r\nordinary duties of the day.\r\n\r\nShe seems to have been somewhat fond of ceremony and to have had a\r\nconsiderable sense of personal dignity. A daughter of Augustine\r\nWashington, who when twelve years of age spent several weeks at Mount\r\nVernon, related when an old woman that every morning precisely at eleven\r\no'clock the mistress of the mansion expected her company to assemble in\r\nthe drawing-room, where she greeted them with much formality and kept\r\nthem an hour on their good behavior. When the clock struck twelve she\r\nwould rise and ascend to her chamber, returning thence precisely at one,\r\nfollowed by a black servant carrying an immense bowl of punch, from\r\nwhich the guests were expected to partake before dinner. Some of the\r\nyounger girls became curious to discover why her \"Ladyship\" retired so\r\ninvariably to her room, so they slipped out from where she was\r\nentertaining their mothers, crept upstairs and hid under her bed.\r\nPresently Lady Washington entered and took a seat before a large table.\r\nA man-servant then brought a large empty bowl, also lemons, sugar,\r\nspices and rum, with which she proceeded to prepare the punch. The young\r\npeople under the bed thereupon fell to giggling until finally she became\r\naware of their presence. Much offended, or at least pretending to be,\r\nshe ordered them from the room. They retired with such precipitancy that\r\none of them fell upon the stairway and broke her arm.\r\n\r\nAnother story is to the effect that one morning Nelly Custis, Miss\r\nDandridge and some other girls who were visiting Nelly came down to\r\nbreakfast dressed dishabille and with their hair done up in curl papers.\r\nMrs. Washington did not rebuke them and the meal proceeded normally\r\nuntil the announcement was made that some French officers of rank and\r\nyoung Charles Carroll, of Carrollton, who was interested in Miss Custis,\r\nhad driven up outside, whereupon the foolish virgins sprang up to leave\r\nthe room in order to make more conventional toilets. But Mrs. Washington\r\nforbade their doing so, declaring that what was good enough for General\r\nWashington was good enough for any guest of his.\r\n\r\nShe spoiled George Washington Custis as she had his father, but was\r\nmore severe with Eleanor or Nelly. Washington bought the girl a fine\r\nimported harpsichord, which cost a thousand dollars and which is still\r\nto be seen at Mount Vernon, and the grandmother made Nelly practise upon\r\nit four or five hours a day. \"The poor girl,\" relates her brother,\r\n\"would play and cry, and cry and play, for long hours, under the\r\nimmediate eye of her grandmother.\" For no shirking was allowed.\r\n\r\nThe truth would seem to be that Lady Washington was more severe with the\r\nyoung--always excepting Jacky and George--than was her husband. He would\r\noften watch their games with evident enjoyment and would encourage them\r\nto continue their amusements and not to regard him. He was the confidant\r\nof their hopes and fears and even amid tremendous cares of state found\r\ntime to give advice about their love affairs. For he was a very human\r\nman, after all, by no means the marble statue sculptured by some\r\nhistorians.\r\n\r\nYet no doubt Mrs. Washington's severity proceeded from a sense of duty\r\nand the fitness of things rather than from any harshness of heart. The\r\nlittle old lady who wrote: \"Kiss Marie. I send her two handkerchiefs to\r\nwipe her nose,\" could not have been so very terrible!\r\n\r\nShe was beloved by her servants and when she left Mount Vernon for New\r\nYork in 1789 young Robert Lewis reported that \"numbers of these poor\r\nwretches seemed most affected, my aunt equally so.\" At Alexandria she\r\nstopped at Doctor Stuart's, the home of two of her grandchildren, and\r\nnext morning there was another affecting scene, such as Lewis never\r\nagain wished to witness--\"the family in tears--the children a-bawling--&\r\neverything in the most lamentable situation.\"\r\n\r\nAlthough she was not the paragon that some writers have pictured, she\r\nwas a splendid home-loving American woman, brave in heart and helpful to\r\nher husband, neither a drone nor a drudge--in the true Scriptural sense\r\na worthy woman who sought wool and flax and worked willingly with her\r\nhands. As such her price was far beyond rubies.\r\n\r\nAs has been remarked before, no brilliant sayings from her lips have\r\nbeen transmitted to posterity. But I suspect that the shivering soldiers\r\non the bleak hillsides at Valley Forge found more comfort in the warm\r\nsocks she knitted than they could have in the _bon mots_ of a Madame de\r\nStael or in the grace of a Josephine and that her homely interest in\r\ntheir welfare tied their hearts closer to their Leader and\r\ntheir Country.\r\n\r\nIt is not merely because she was the wife of the Hero of the Revolution\r\nand the first President of the Republic that she is the most revered of\r\nall American women.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIV\r\n\r\n\r\nA FARMER'S AMUSEMENTS\r\n\r\nNo one would ever think of characterizing George Washington as frivolous\r\nminded, but from youth to old age he was a believer in the adage that\r\nall work and no play makes Jack a dull boy--a saying that many an\r\noverworked farmer of our own day would do well to take to heart.\r\n\r\nLike most Virginians he was decidedly a social being and loved to be in\r\nthe company of his kind. This trait was noticeable in his youth and\r\nduring his early military career, nor did it disappear after he married\r\nand settled down at Mount Vernon. Until the end he and Mrs. Washington\r\nkept open house, and what a galaxy of company they had! Scarcely a day\r\npassed without some guest crossing their hospitable threshold, nor did\r\nsuch visitors come merely to leave their cards or to pay fashionable\r\nfive-minute calls. They invariably stayed to dinner and most generally\r\nfor the night; very often for days or weeks at a time. After the\r\nRevolution the number of guests increased to such an extent that Mount\r\nVernon became \"little better than a well-resorted inn.\"\r\n\r\nArtists came to paint the great man's picture; the sculptor Houdon to\r\ntake the great man's bust, arriving from Alexandria, by the way, after\r\nthe family had gone to bed; the Marquis de Lafayette to visit his old\r\nfriend; Mrs. Macaulay Graham to obtain material for her history; Noah\r\nWebster to consider whether he would become the tutor of young Custis;\r\nMr. John Fitch, November 4, 1785, \"to propose a draft & Model of a\r\nmachine for promoting Navigation by means of a Steam\"; Charles Thomson,\r\nsecretary of the Continental Congress, to notify the General of his\r\nelection to the presidency; a host of others, some out of friendship,\r\nothers from mere curiosity or a desire for free lodging.\r\n\r\nThe visit of Lafayette was the last he made to this country while the\r\nman with whose fame his name is inseparably linked remained alive. He\r\nvisited Mount Vernon in August, 1784, and again three months later. When\r\nthe time for a final adieu came Washington accompanied him to Annapolis\r\nand saw him on the road to Baltimore. The generous young benefactor of\r\nAmerica was very dear to Washington, and the parting affected him\r\nexceedingly. Soon after he wrote to the departed friend a letter in\r\nwhich he showed his heart in a way that was rare with him. \"In the\r\nmoment of our separation,\" said he, \"upon the road as I travelled, and\r\nevery hour since, I have felt all the love, respect, and attachment for\r\nyou with which length of years, close connextion, and your merits have\r\ninspired me. I have often asked myself, as our carriages separated,\r\nwhether that was the last sight I ever should have of you.\"\r\n\r\nIt was a true foreboding. Often in times that followed Washington was to\r\nreceive tidings of his friend's triumphs and perilous adventures amid\r\nthe bloody turmoil of the French Revolution, was to entertain his son at\r\nMount Vernon when the father lay in the dark dungeons of Olmütz, but was\r\nnever again to look into his face. Years later the younger man,\r\nrevisiting the grateful Republic he had helped to found, was to turn\r\naside from the acclaiming plaudits of admiring multitudes and stand\r\npensively beside the Tomb of his Leader and reflect upon the years in\r\nwhich they had stood gloriously shoulder to shoulder in defense of a\r\nnoble cause.\r\n\r\nEven when Washington was at the seat of government many persons stopped\r\nat Mount Vernon and were entertained by the manager. Several times the\r\nabsent owner sent wine and other luxuries for the use of such guests.\r\nWhen he was at home friends, relatives, diplomats, delegations of\r\nIndians to visit the Great White Father swarmed thither in shoals. In\r\n1797 young Lafayette and his tutor, Monsieur Frestel, whom Washington\r\nthought a very sensible man, made the place, by invitation, their home\r\nfor several months. In the summer of that year Washington wrote to his\r\nold secretary, Tobias Lear: \"I am alone at _present_, and shall be glad\r\nto see you this evening. Unless some one pops in unexpectedly--Mrs.\r\nWashington and myself will do what I believe has not been done within\r\nthe last twenty Years by us,--that is to set down to dinner by\r\nourselves.\"\r\n\r\nWashington was the soul of hospitality. He enjoyed having people in his\r\nhouse and eating at his board, but there is evidence that toward the\r\nlast he grew somewhat weary of the stream of strangers. But neither then\r\nnor at any other time in his life did he show his impatience to a\r\nvisitor or turn any man from his door. His patience, was sorely tried at\r\ntimes. For example, we find in his diary under date of September 7,\r\n1785: \"At Night, a Man of the name of Purdie, came to offer himself to\r\nme as a Housekeeper or Household Steward--he had some testimonials\r\nrespecting his character--but being intoxicated, and in other respects\r\nappearing in an unfavorable light I informed him that he would not\r\nanswer my purpose, but that he might stay all night.\"\r\n\r\nNo matter how many visitors came the Farmer proceeded about his business\r\nas usual, particularly in the morning, devoting dinner time and certain\r\nhours of the afternoon and evening to those who were sojourning with\r\nhim. He was obliged, in self-defense, to adopt some such course. He\r\nwrote: \"My manner of living is plain, and I do not mean to be put out by\r\nit. A glass of wine and a bit of mutton are always ready, and such as\r\nwill be content to partake of them are always welcome. Those who expect\r\nmore will be disappointed.\"\r\n\r\nAfter his retirement from the presidency he induced his nephew Lawrence\r\nLewis to come to Mount Vernon and take over some of the duties of\r\nentertaining guests, particularly in the evening, as Washington had\r\nreached an age when he was averse to staying up late. Lewis not only\r\nperformed the task satisfactorily, but found incidental diversion that\r\nled to matrimony.\r\n\r\nEvery visitor records that the Farmer was a kind and considerate host.\r\nElkanah Watson relates that one bitter winter night at Mount Vernon,\r\nhaving a severe cold that caused him to cough incessantly, he heard the\r\ndoor of his chamber open gently and there stood the General with a\r\ncandle in one hand and a bowl of hot tea in another. Doubtless George\r\nand Martha had heard the coughing and in family council had decided that\r\ntheir guest must have attention.\r\n\r\nWashington was a Cavalier, not a Puritan, and had none of the old New\r\nEngland prejudice against the theater. In fact, it was one of his\r\nfondest pleasures from youth to old age. In his Barbadoes journal he\r\nrecords being \"treated with a play ticket by Mr. Carter to see the\r\nTragedy of George Barnwell acted.\" In 1752 he attended a performance at\r\nFredericksburg and thereafter, whenever occasion offered, which during\r\nhis earlier years was not often, he took advantage of it. He even\r\nexpressed a desire to act himself. After his resignation and marriage\r\nopportunities were more frequent and in his cash memorandum books are\r\nmany entries of expenditures for tickets to performances at Alexandria\r\nand elsewhere. Thus on September 20, 1768, in his daily record of\r\n_Where & how my time is Spent_ he writes that he \"& Mrs. Washington & ye\r\ntwo children were up to Alexandria to see the Inconstant or way to win\r\nhim acted.\" Next day he \"Stayd in Town all day & saw the Tragedy of\r\nDouglas playd.\"\r\n\r\nSuch performances were probably given by strolling players who had few\r\naccessories in the way of scenery to assist them in creating their\r\nillusions.\r\n\r\nIn September, 1771, when at Annapolis to attend the races, he went to\r\nplays four times in five days, the fifth day being Sunday. Two years\r\nlater, being in New York City, he saw _Hamlet_ and _Cross Purposes_.\r\n\r\nOn many occasions both in this period of his life and later he went to\r\nsleight of hand performances, wax works, puppet shows, animal shows, \"to\r\nhear the Armonica,\" concerts and other entertainments.\r\n\r\nThe \"association\" resolutions of frugality and self-denial by the\r\nContinental Congress put an end temporarily to plays in the colonies\r\noutside the British lines and put Washington into a greater play, \"not,\r\nas he once wished, as a performer, but as a character.\" There were\r\namateur performances at Valley Forge, but they aroused the hostility of\r\nthe puritanical, and Congress forbade them. Washington seems, however,\r\nto have disregarded the interdiction after Yorktown.\r\n\r\nHe had few opportunities to gratify his fondness for performances in the\r\nperiod of 1784-89, but during his presidency, while residing in New York\r\nand Philadelphia, he was a regular attendant. He gave frequent theater\r\nparties, sending tickets to his friends. Word that he would attend a\r\nplay always insured a \"full house,\" and upon his entrance to his box the\r\norchestra would play _Hail Columbia_ and _Washington's March_ amid great\r\nenthusiasm.\r\n\r\nThe _Federal Gazette_ described a performance of _The Maid of the Mill,_\r\nwhich he attended in 1792, as follows:\r\n\r\n\"When Mr. Hodgkinson as Lord Ainsworth exhibited nobleness of mind in\r\nhis generosity to the humble miller and his daughter, Patty; when he\r\nfound her blessed with all the qualities that captivate and endear life,\r\nand knew she was capable of adorning a higher sphere; when he had\r\ninterviews with her upon the subject in which was painted the\r\namiableness of an honorable passion; and after his connection, when he\r\nbestowed his benefactions on the relatives, etc., of the old miller, the\r\ngreat and good Washington manifested his approbation of this\r\ninteresting part of the opera by the tribute of a tear.\"\r\n\r\nAnother amusement that both the Farmer and his wife enjoyed greatly was\r\ndancing. In his youth he attended balls and \"routs\" whenever possible\r\nand when fighting French and Indians on the frontier he felt as one of\r\nhis main deprivations his inability to attend the \"Assemblies.\" After\r\nhis marriage he and his wife went often to balls in Alexandria, attired\r\nno doubt in all the bravery of imported English clothes. He describes a\r\nball of 1760 in these terms:\r\n\r\n\"Went to a ball at Alexandria, where Musick and dancing was the chief\r\nentertainment, however, in a convenient room detached for the purpose\r\nabounded great plenty of bread and butter, some biscuits, with tea and\r\ncoffee, which the drinkers of could not distinguish from hot water\r\nsweet'ned--Be it remembered that pocket handkerchiefs served the\r\npurposes of Table cloths & Napkins and that no apologies were made for\r\neither. I shall therefore distinguish this ball by the stile and title\r\nof the Bread & Butter Ball.\"\r\n\r\nA certain Mr. Christian conducted a dancing school which met at the\r\nhomes of the patrons, and the Custis children, John Parke and Martha,\r\nwere members, as were Elizabeth French of Rose Hill, Milly Posey and\r\nothers of the neighborhood young people. In 1770 the class met four\r\ntimes at Mount Vernon and we can not doubt that occasionally the host\r\ndanced with some of the young misses and enjoyed it.\r\n\r\nAn established institution was the election ball, which took place on\r\nthe night following the choice of the delegate to the Burgesses.\r\nWashington often contributed to the expenses of these balls,\r\nparticularly when he was himself elected. No doubt they were noisy,\r\nhilarious and perhaps now and then a bit rough.\r\n\r\nMuch has been written of the dances by which Washington and his officers\r\nand their ladies helped to while away the tedium of long winters during\r\nthe Revolution, but the story of these has been often told and besides\r\nlies outside the limits of this book, as does the dancing at New York\r\nand Philadelphia during his presidency.\r\n\r\nThere is much conflicting evidence regarding Washington's later dancing\r\nexploits. Some writers say that he never tripped the light fantastic\r\nafter the Revolution and that one of his last participations was at the\r\nFredericksburg ball after the capture of Cornwallis when he \"went down\r\nsome dozen couple in the contra dance.\" It is certain, however, that\r\nlong afterward he would at least walk through one or two dances, even\r\nthough he did not actually take the steps. One good lady who knew him\r\nwell asserts that he often danced with Nelly Custis, and he seems to\r\nhave danced in 1796 when he was sixty-four. But to the invitation to the\r\nAlexandria assembly early in 1799 he replied:\r\n\r\n\"Mrs. Washington and myself have been honored with your polite\r\ninvitation to the assemblies of Alexandria this winter, and thank you\r\nfor this mark of your attention. But, alas! our dancing days are no\r\nmore. We wish, however, all those who have a relish for so agreeable and\r\ninnocent an amusement all the pleasure the season will afford them.\"\r\n\r\nNor was he puritanical in respect to cards. From his account books we\r\nfind that he ordered them by the dozen packs, and his diaries contain\r\nsuch entries as \"At home all day over cards, it snowing.\" To increase\r\nthe interest he not infrequently played for money, though rarely for a\r\nlarge amount. \"Loo\" and whist seem to have been the games played, but\r\nnot \"bridge\" or draw poker, which were then unknown.\r\n\r\nFrom entries in his cash memorandum books it is evident that he loved a\r\nquiet game rather frequently. Thus in his memorandum for 1772 I find the\r\nentry for September five: \"To Cash won at cards\" £1.5. Four days later\r\nhe writes: \"To Cash won at Cards at Mrs. Calverts\" ten shillings. But on\r\nSeptember 17th he lost £1.5; on September 30th, £2, and on October 5th,\r\nsix shillings. Two days later his luck changed and he won £2.5, while on\r\nthe seventh he won £12.8. This was the most serious game that I have\r\nfound a record of, and the cards must either have run well for him or\r\nelse he had unskilful opponents. The following March, when attending the\r\nBurgesses at Williamsburg, he got into a game, probably at Mrs.\r\nCampbell's tavern, where he took his meals, and dropped £7.10.\r\n\r\nIn one of his account books I find two pages devoted to striking a\r\nbalance between what he won and what he lost from January 7, 1772, to\r\nJanuary 1, 1775. In that time he won £72.2.6 and lost £78.5.9. Hence we\r\nfind the entry: \"By balance against Play from Jany. 1772 to this\r\ndate ... £6.3.3.\" But he must have had a lot of fun at a cost of that\r\nsix pounds three shillings and three pence!\r\n\r\nIt should be remarked here that gaming was then differently regarded in\r\nVirginia from what it is now. Many even of the Episcopal clergymen\r\nplayed cards for money and still kept fast hold upon their belief that\r\nthey would go to Heaven.\r\n\r\nThe same may also be said of lotteries, in which Washington now and then\r\ntook a flier. Many of the churches of that day, even in New England,\r\nwere built partly or wholly with money raised in that way. January 5,\r\n1773, Washington states that he has received sixty tickets in the\r\nDelaware lottery from his friend Lord Stirling and that he has \"put 12\r\nof the above Sixty into the Hands of the Revd. Mr. Magowan to sell.\" And\r\n\"the Revd.\" sold them too!\r\n\r\nIn his journal of the trip to Barbadoes taken with his brother Lawrence\r\nwe find that on his way home he attended \"a Great Main of cks [cocks]\r\nfought in Yorktown between Gloucester & York for 5 pistoles each battle\r\n& 10 ye. odd.\" Occasionally he seems to have witnessed other mains, but\r\nI have found no evidence that he made the practice in any sense a habit.\r\n\r\nAs a counterweight to his interest in so brutal a sport I must state\r\nthat he was exceedingly fond of afternoon teas and of the social\r\nenjoyments connected with tea drinking. Tea was regularly served at his\r\narmy headquarters and in summer afternoons on the Mount Vernon veranda.\r\n\r\nThere is abundant evidence that he also enjoyed horse racing. In\r\nSeptember, 1768, he mentions going \"to a Purse race at Accotinck,\" a\r\nhamlet a few miles below Mount Vernon where a race track was maintained.\r\nIn 1772 he attended the Annapolis races, being a guest of the Governor\r\nof Maryland, and he repeated the trip in 1773. In the following May he\r\nwent to a race and barbecue at Johnson's Ferry. George Washington Custis\r\ntells us that the Farmer kept blooded horses and that his colt\r\n\"Magnolia\" once ran for a purse, presumably losing, as if the event had\r\nbeen otherwise we should probably have been informed of the fact. In\r\n1786 Washington went to Alexandria \"to see the Jockey Club purse run\r\nfor,\" and I have noticed a few other references to races, but I conclude\r\nthat he went less often than some writers would have us believe.\r\n\r\nWashington was decidedly an outdoor man. Being six feet two inches tall,\r\nand slender rather than heavily made, he was well fitted for athletic\r\nsports. Tradition says that he once threw a stone across the\r\nRappahannock at a spot where no other man could do it, and that he could\r\noutjump any one in Virginia. He also excelled in the game of putting the\r\nbar, as a story related by the artist Peale bears witness.\r\n\r\nOf outdoor sports he seems to have enjoyed hunting most. He probably had\r\nmany unrecorded experiences with deer and turkeys when a surveyor and\r\nwhen in command upon the western border, but his main hunting adventure\r\nafter big game took place on his trip to the Ohio in 1770. Though the\r\nparty was on the move most of the time and was looking for rich land\r\nrather than for wild animals, they nevertheless took some hunts.\r\n\r\nOn October twenty-second, in descending the stretch of the Ohio near the\r\nmouth of Little Beaver Creek and above the Mingo Town, they saw many\r\nwild geese and several kinds of duck and \"killed five wild turkeys.\"\r\nThree days later they \"saw innumerable quantities of turkeys, and many\r\ndeer watering and browsing on the shore side, some of which we killed.\"\r\n\r\nHe does not say whether they shot this game from the canoe or not, but\r\nprobably on sighting the game they would put to shore and then one or\r\nmore would steal up on the quarry. Their success was probably increased\r\nby the fact that they had two Indians with them.\r\n\r\nFew people are aware of the fact that what is now West Virginia and Ohio\r\nthen contained many buffaloes. Below the mouth of the Great Hockhocking\r\nthe voyagers came upon a camp of Indians, the chief of which, an old\r\nfriend who had accompanied him to warn out the French in 1753, gave\r\nWashington \"a quarter of very fine buffalo.\" A creek near the camp,\r\naccording to the Indians, was an especial resort for these great beasts.\r\n\r\nFourteen miles up the Great Kanawha the travelers took a day off and\r\n\"went a hunting; killed five buffaloes and wounded some others, three\r\ndeer, &c. This country abounds in buffaloes and wild game of all kinds;\r\nas also in all kinds of wild fowls, there being in the bottoms a great\r\nmany small grassy ponds, or lakes, which are full of swans, geese, and\r\nducks of different kinds.\"\r\n\r\nHow many of the buffaloes fell to his gun Washington does not record,\r\nbut it is safe to assume that he had at least some shots at them. And\r\nbeyond question he helped to devour the delicious buffalo humps, these\r\nbeing, with the flesh of the bighorn sheep, the _ne plus ultra_ of\r\nAmerican big game delicacies.\r\n\r\nThe region in which these events took place was also notable for its big\r\ntrees. Near the mouth of the Kanawha they \"met with a sycamore about\r\nsixty yards from the river of a most extraordinary size, it measuring,\r\nthree feet from the ground, forty-five feet round [almost fifteen feet\r\nthrough], lacking two inches; and not fifty yards from it was another,\r\nthirty-one feet round.\"\r\n\r\nWhen at home, Washington now and then took a gun and went out after\r\nducks, \"hairs,\" wild turkeys and other game, and occasionally he records\r\nfair bags of mallards, teal, bald faces and \"blew wings,\" one of the\r\nbest being that of February 18, 1768, when he \"went a ducking between\r\nbreakfast and dinner & killed 2 mallards & 5 bald faces.\" It is doubtful\r\nwhether he was at all an expert shot. In fact, he much preferred chasing\r\nthe fox with dogs to hunting with a gun.\r\n\r\nFox hunting in the Virginia of that day was a widely followed sport. It\r\nwas brought over from England and perhaps its greatest devotee was old\r\nLord Fairfax, with whom Washington hunted when still in his teens.\r\nFairfax, whose seat was at Greenway Court in the Shenandoah Valley, was\r\nso passionately fond of it that if foxes were scarce near his home he\r\nwould go to a locality where they were plentiful, would establish\r\nhimself at an inn and would keep open house and welcome every person of\r\ngood character and respectable appearance who cared to join him.\r\n\r\nThe following are some typical entries from Washington's _Where & how my\r\ntime is Spent_: \"Jany. 1st. (1768) Fox huntg. in my own Neck with Mr.\r\nRobt. Alexander and Mr. Colville--catchd nothing--Captn. Posey with us.\"\r\nThere were many similar failures and no successes in the next six weeks,\r\nbut on February twelfth he records joyfully, \"Catchd two foxes,\" and on\r\nthe thirteenth \"catch 2 more foxes.\" March 2, 1768, \"Hunting again, &\r\ncatchd a fox with a bobd Tail & cut Ears, after 7 hours chase in wch.\r\nmost of the dogs were worsted.\" March twenty-ninth, \"Fox Hunting with\r\nJacky Custis & Ld. [Lund] Washington--Catchd a fox after 3 hrs. chase.\"\r\nNovember twenty-second, \"Went a fox huntg. with Lord Fairfax & Colo.\r\nFairfax & my Br. Catchd 2 Foxes.\" For two weeks thereafter they hunted\r\nalmost every day with varying success. September 30, 1769, he records:\r\n\"catchd a Rakoon.\"\r\n\r\nOn January 27, 1770, the dogs ran a deer out of the Neck and some of\r\nthem did not get home till next day. The finding of a deer was no\r\nuncommon experience, but on no occasion does the chase seem to have been\r\nsuccessful, as, when hard pressed, the fugitive would take to the water\r\nwhere the dogs could not follow. January 4, 1772, the hunters \"found\r\nboth a Bear and a Fox but got neither.\"\r\n\r\nBear and deer were still fairly plentiful in the region, and the fact\r\nserves to indicate that the country was not yet thickly settled, nor is\r\nit to this day.\r\n\r\nIn November, 1771, Washington and Jack Custis went to Colonel Mason's at\r\nGunston Hall, a few miles below Mount Vernon, to engage in a grand deer\r\ndrive in which many men and dogs took part. Mason had an estate of ten\r\nthousand acres which was favorably located for such a purpose, being\r\nnearly surrounded by water, with peninsulas on which the game could be\r\ncornered and forced to take to the river. On the first day they killed\r\ntwo deer, but on the second they killed nothing. No doubt they had a\r\nhilarious time of it, dogs baying, horsemen dashing here and there\r\nshouting at the top of their voices, and with plenty of fat venison and\r\nother good cheer at the Hall that night.\r\n\r\nWashington's most remarkable hunting experience occurred on the\r\ntwenty-third of January, 1770, when he records: \"Went a hunting after\r\nbreakfast & found a Fox at Muddy hole & killed her (it being a Bitch)\r\nafter a chase of better than two hours & after treeing her twice the\r\nlast of which times she fell dead out of the Tree after being therein\r\nsevl. minutes apparently well.\" Lest he may be accused of nature faking,\r\nit should be explained that the tree was a leaning tree. Occasionally\r\nthe foxes also took refuge in hollow trees, up which they could climb.\r\n\r\nThe day usually ended by all the hunters riding to Mount Vernon,\r\nBelvoir, Gunston Hall, or some other mansion for a bountiful dinner.\r\nMighty then were the gastronomic feats performed, and over the Madeira\r\nthe incidents of the day were discussed as Nimrods in all ages are\r\nwont to do.\r\n\r\nBeing so much interested in fox hunting, our Farmer proceeded, with his\r\nusual painstaking care, to build up a pack of hounds. The year 1768 was\r\nprobably the period of his greatest interest in the subject and his\r\ndiary is full of accounts of the animals. Hounds were now, in fact, his\r\nhobby, succeeding in interest his horses. He did his best to breed\r\naccording to scientific principles, but several entries show that the\r\ndogs themselves were inclined blissfully to ignore the laws of eugenics\r\nas applied to hounds.\r\n\r\nAmong his dogs in this period were \"Mopsey,\" \"Taster,\" \"Tipler,\" \"Cloe,\"\r\n\"Lady,\" \"Forester\" and \"Captain.\" August 6, 1768, we learn that \"Lady\"\r\nhas four puppies, which are to be called \"Vulcan,\" \"Searcher,\" \"Rover,\"\r\nand \"Sweetlips.\"\r\n\r\nLike all dog owners he had other troubles with his pets. Once we find\r\nhim anointing all the hounds that had the mange \"with Hogs Lard &\r\nBrimstone.\" Again his pack is menaced by a suspected mad dog, which\r\nhe shoots.\r\n\r\nThe Revolution broke rudely in upon the Farmer's sports, but upon his\r\nreturn to Mount Vernon he soon took up the old life. Knowing his bent,\r\nLafayette sent him a pack of French hounds, two dogs and three bitches,\r\nand Washington took much interest in them. According to George\r\nWashington Custis they were enormous brutes, better built for grappling\r\nstags or boars than chasing foxes, and so fierce that a huntsman had to\r\npreside at their meals. Their kennel stood a hundred yards south of the\r\nold family vault, and Washington visited them every morning and evening.\r\nAccording to Custis, it was the Farmer's desire to have them so evenly\r\nmatched and trained that if one leading dog should lose the scent,\r\nanother would be at hand to recover it and thus in full cry you might\r\ncover the pack with a blanket.\r\n\r\nThe biggest of the French hounds, \"Vulcan,\" was so vast that he was\r\noften ridden by Master Custis and he seems to have been a rather\r\nprivileged character. Once when company was expected to dinner Mrs.\r\nWashington ordered that a lordly ham should be cooked and served. At\r\ndinner she noticed that the ham was not in its place and inquiry\r\ndeveloped that \"Vulcan\" had raided the kitchen and made off with the\r\nmeat. Thereupon, of course, the mistress scolded and equally, of course,\r\nthe master smiled and gleefully told the news to the guests.\r\n\r\nBilly Lee, the colored valet who had followed the General through the\r\nRevolution, usually acted as huntsman and, mounted on \"Chinkling\" or\r\nsome other good steed, with a French horn at his back, strove hard to\r\nkeep the pack in sight, no easy task among the rough timber-covered\r\nhills of Fairfax County.\r\n\r\nOn a hunting day the Farmer breakfasted by candlelight, generally upon\r\ncorn cakes and milk, and at daybreak, with his guests, Billy and the\r\nhounds, sallied forth to find a fox. Washington always rode a good horse\r\nand sometimes wore a blue coat, scarlet waistcoat, buckskin breeches,\r\ntop boots and velvet cap and carried a whip with a long thong. When a\r\nfox was started none rode more gallantly or cheered more joyously than\r\ndid he and as a rule he was in at the death, for, as Jefferson asserts,\r\nhe was \"the best horseman of his age, and the most magnificent figure\r\nthat could be seen on horseback.\"\r\n\r\nThe fox that was generally hunted was the gray fox, which was indigenous\r\nto the country. After the Revolution the red fox began to be seen\r\noccasionally. They are supposed to have come from the Eastern Shore, and\r\nto have crossed Chesapeake Bay on the ice in the hard winter of 1779-80.\r\nCustis tells of a famous black fox that would go ten or twenty miles\r\nbefore the hounds and return to the starting-point ready for another run\r\nnext day. After many unsuccessful chases Billy recommended that the\r\nblack reynard be let alone, saying he was near akin to another sable\r\nand wily character. Thereafter the huntsman was always careful to throw\r\noff the hounds when he suspected that they were on the trail of the\r\nblack fox. This story may or may not be true; all that I can say is that\r\nI have found no confirmation of it in Washington's own writings.\r\n\r\nNeither have I found there any confirmation of the story that Mrs.\r\nWashington and other ladies often rode out to see the hunts. Washington\r\nhad avenues cut through some of his woods to facilitate the sport and\r\npossibly to make the riding easier for the ladies. Upon the whole,\r\nhowever, I incline to the opinion that generally at least Martha stayed\r\nat home visiting with lady friends, attending to domestic concerns and\r\nsuperintending the preparation of delectable dishes for the hungry\r\nhunters. I very much doubt whether she would have enjoyed seeing a\r\nfox killed.\r\n\r\nThe French hounds were, at least at first, rather indifferent hunters.\r\n\"Went out after Breakfast with my hounds from France, & two which were\r\nlent me, yesterday, by Mr. Mason,\" says the Farmer the day of the first\r\ntrial; \"found a Fox which was run tolerably well by two of the Frh.\r\nBitches & one of Mason's Dogs--the other French dogs shewed but little\r\ndisposition to follow--and with the second Dog of Mason's got upon\r\nanother Fox which was followed slow and indifferently by some & not at\r\nall by the rest until the sent became so cold it cd. not be followed\r\nat all.\"\r\n\r\nTwo days later the dogs failed again and the next time they ran two\r\nfoxes and caught neither, but their master thought they performed better\r\nthan hitherto, December 12th:\r\n\r\n\"After an early breakfast [my nephew] George Washington, Mr. Shaw and\r\nMyself went into the Woods back of the Muddy hole Plantation a hunting\r\nand were joined by Mr. Lund Washington and Mr. William Peake. About half\r\nafter ten O'clock (being first plagued with the Dogs running Hogs) we\r\nfound a fox near Colo Masons Plantation on little Hunting Creek (West\r\nfork) having followed on his Drag more than half a Mile; and run him\r\nwith Eight Dogs (the other 4 getting, as was supposed after a Second\r\nFox) close and well for an hour. When the Dogs came to a fault and to\r\ncold Hunting until 20 minutes after when being joined by the missing\r\nDogs they put him up afresh and in about 50 Minutes killed up in an open\r\nfield of Colo Mason's every Rider & every Dog being present at\r\nthe Death.\"\r\n\r\nEight days later the pack chased two foxes, but caught neither. The next\r\nhunt is described as follows:\r\n\r\n\"Went a Fox hunting with the Gentlemen who came here yesterday with\r\nFerdinando Washington and Mr. Shaw, after a very early breakfast.--found\r\na Fox just back of Muddy hole Plantation and after a Chase for an hour\r\nand a quarter with my Dogs, & eight couple of Doctor Smiths (brought by\r\nMr. Phil Alexander) we put him into a hollow tree, in which we fastened\r\nhim, and in the Pincushion put up another Fox which, in an hour and 13\r\nMinutes was killed--We then after allowing the Fox in the hole half an\r\nhour put the Dogs upon his Trail & in half a Mile he took to another\r\nhollow tree and was again put out of it but he did not go 600 yards\r\nbefore he had recourse to the same shift--finding therefore that he was\r\na conquered Fox we took the Dogs off, and came home to dinner.\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration: The Flower Garden, By permission of the Mount Vernon\r\nLadies' Association]\r\n\r\nCustis asserts that Washington took his last hunt in 1785, but in the\r\ndiary under date of December 22, 1787, I find that he went out with\r\nMajor George A. Washington and others on that day, but found nothing,\r\nand that he took still another hunt in January, 1788, and chased a fox\r\nthat had been captured the previous month. This, however, is the last\r\nreference that I have discovered. No doubt he was less resilient than in\r\nhis younger days and found the sport less delightful than of yore, while\r\nthe duties of the presidency, to which he was soon called, left him\r\nlittle leisure for sport. He seems to have broken up his kennels and to\r\nhave given away most or all of his hounds.\r\n\r\nLater he acquired a pair of \"tarriers\" and took enough interest in them\r\nto write detailed instructions concerning them in 1796.\r\n\r\nWashington's fishing was mostly done with a seine as a commercial\r\nproposition, but he seems to have had a mild interest in angling.\r\nOccasionally he took trips up and down the Potomac in order to fish,\r\nsometimes with a hook and line, at other times with seines and nets. He\r\nand Doctor Craik took fishing tackle with them on both their western\r\ntours and made use of it in some of the mountain streams and also in the\r\nOhio. While at the Federal Convention in 1787 he and Gouverneur Morris\r\nwent up to Valley Forge partly perhaps to see the old camp, but\r\nostensibly to fish for trout. They lodged at the home of a widow named\r\nMoore. On the trip the Farmer learned the Pennsylvania way of raising\r\nbuckwheat and, it must be confessed, wrote down much more about this\r\ntopic than about trout. A few days later, with Gouverneur Morris and Mr.\r\nand Mrs. Robert Morris, he went up to Trenton and \"in the evening\r\nfished,\" with what success he does not relate. When on his eastern tour\r\nof 1789 he went outside the harbor of Portsmouth to fish for cod, but\r\nthe tide was unfavorable and they caught only two. More fortunate was a\r\ntrip off Sandy Hook the next year, which was thus described by a\r\nnewspaper:\r\n\r\n\"Yesterday afternoon the President of the United States returned from\r\nSandy Hook and the fishing banks, where he had been for the benefit of\r\nthe sea air, and to amuse himself in the delightful recreation of\r\nfishing. We are told he has had excellent sport, having himself caught a\r\ngreat number of sea-bass and black fish--the weather proved remarkably\r\nfine, which, together with the salubrity of the air and wholesome\r\nexercise, rendered this little voyage extremely agreeable.\"\r\n\r\nOur Farmer was extremely fond of fish as an article of diet and took\r\ngreat pains to have them on his table frequently. At Mount Vernon there\r\nwas an ancient black man, reputed to be a centenarian and the son of an\r\nAfrican King, whose duty it was to keep the household supplied with\r\nfish. On many a morning he could be seen out on the river in his skiff,\r\nbeguiling the toothsome perch, bass or rock-fish. Not infrequently he\r\nwould fall asleep and then the impatient cook, who had orders to have\r\ndinner strictly upon the hour, would be compelled to seek the shore and\r\nroar at him. Old Jack would waken and upon rowing to shore would inquire\r\nangrily: \"What you all mek such a debbil of a racket for hey? I wa'nt\r\nasleep, only noddin'.\"\r\n\r\nAnother colored factotum about the place was known as Tom Davis, whose\r\nduty it was to supply the Mansion House with game. With the aid of his\r\nold British musket and of his Newfoundland dog \"Gunner\" he secured many\r\na canvasback and mallard, to say nothing of quails, turkeys and\r\nother game.\r\n\r\nAfter the Revolution Washington formed a deer park below the hill on\r\nwhich the Mansion House stands. The park contained about one hundred\r\nacres and was surrounded by a high paling about sixteen hundred yards\r\nlong. At first he had only Virginia deer, but later acquired some\r\nEnglish fallow deer from the park of Governor Ogle of Maryland. Both\r\nvarieties herded together, but never mixed blood. The deer were\r\ncontinually getting out and in February, 1786, one returned with a\r\nbroken leg, \"supposed to be by a shot.\" Seven years later an English\r\nbuck that had broken out weeks before was killed by some one. The\r\npaddock fence was neglected and ultimately the deer ran half wild over\r\nthe estate, but in general stayed in the wooded region surrounding the\r\nMansion House. The gardener frequently complained of damage done by them\r\nto shrubs and plants, and Washington said he hardly knew \"whether to\r\ngive up the Shrubs or the Deer!\" The spring before his death we find him\r\nwriting to the brothers Chickesters warning them to cease hunting his\r\ndeer and he hints that he may come to \"the disagreeable necessity of\r\nresorting to other means.\"\r\n\r\nGeorge Washington Custis, being like his father \"Jacky\" an enthusiastic\r\nhunter, long teased the General to permit him to hunt the deer and at\r\nlast won consent to shoot one buck. The lad accordingly loaded an old\r\nBritish musket with two ounce-balls, sallied forth and wounded one of\r\nthe patriarchs of the herd, which was then chased into the Potomac and\r\nthere slain. Next day the buck was served up to several guests, and\r\nCustis long afterward treasured the antlers at Arlington House, the\r\nresidence he later built across the Potomac from the Federal City.\r\n\r\nUpon the whole we must conclude that Washington was one of the best\r\nsportsmen of all our Presidents. He was not so much of an Izaak Walton\r\nas was one of his successors, nor did he pursue the lion and festive\r\nbongo to their African lairs as did another, but he had a keen love of\r\nnature and the open country and would have found both the Mighty Hunter\r\nand the Mighty Angler kindred spirits.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XV\r\n\r\n\r\nA CRITICAL VISITOR AT MOUNT VERNON\r\n\r\nAbout thirty miles down the river Potomac, a gentleman, of the name of\r\nGrimes, came up to us in his own boat[8]. He had some little time\r\nbefore shot a man who was going across his plantation; and had been\r\ntried for so doing, but not punished. He came aboard, and behaved very\r\npolitely to me: and it being near dinner time, he would have me go\r\nashore and dine with him: which I did. He gave me some grape-juice to\r\ndrink, which he called Port wine, and entertained me with saying he made\r\nit himself: it was not to my taste equal to our Port in England, nor\r\neven strong beer; but a hearty welcome makes everything pleasant, and\r\nthis he most cheerfully gave me. He showed me his garden; the produce of\r\nwhich, he told me, he sold at Alexandria, a distance of thirty miles.\r\nHis garden was in disorder: and so was everything else I saw about the\r\nplace; except a favourite stallion, which was in very good condition--a\r\npretty figure of a horse, and of proper size for the road, about fifteen\r\nhands high. He likewise showed me some other horses, brood-mares and\r\nfoals, young colts, &c. of rather an useful kind. His cattle were small,\r\nbut all much better than the land.\r\n\r\n[8] This chapter is taken from _A Tour of America in 1798, 1799, and\r\n1800_, by Richard Parkinson, who has already been several times quoted.\r\nParkinson had won something of a name in England as a scientific\r\nagriculturist and had published a book called the _Experienced Farmer_.\r\nHe negotiated by letter with Washington for the rental of one of the\r\nMount Vernon farms, and in 1798, without having made any definite\r\nengagement, sailed for the Potomac with a cargo of good horses, cattle\r\nand hogs. His plan for renting Washington's farm fell through, by his\r\naccount because it was so poor, and ultimately he settled for a time\r\nnear Baltimore, where he underwent such experiences as an opinionated\r\nEnglishman with new methods would be likely to meet. Soured by failure,\r\nhe returned to England, and published an account of his travels, partly\r\nwith the avowed purpose of discouraging emigration to America. His\r\nopinion of the country he summed up thus: \"If a man should be so\r\nunfortunate as to have married a wife of a capricious disposition, let\r\nhim take her to America, and keep her there three or four years in a\r\ncountry-place at some distance from a town, and afterwards bring her\r\nback to England; if she do not act with propriety, he may be sure there\r\nis no remedy.\" I have rearranged his account in such a way as to make it\r\nconsecutive, but otherwise it stands as originally published.\r\n\r\nHe praised the soil very highly. I asked him if he was acquainted with\r\nthe land at Mount Vernon. He said he was; and represented it to be rich\r\nland, but not so rich as his. Yet his I thought very poor indeed; for\r\nit was (as is termed in America) _gullied_; which I call broken land.\r\nThis effect is produced by the winter's frost and summer's rain, which\r\ncut the land into cavities of from ten feet wide and ten feet deep (and\r\nupwards) in many places; and, added to this, here and there a hole,\r\nwhich makes it look altogether like marlpits, or stone-quarries, that\r\nhave been carried away by those hasty showers in the summer, which no\r\nman who has not seen them in this climate could form any idea of or\r\nbelieve possible....\r\n\r\nIn two days after we left this place, we came in sight of Mount Vernon;\r\nbut in all the way up the river, I did not see any green fields. The\r\ncountry had to me a most barren appearance. There were none but\r\nsnake-fences; which are rails laid with the ends of one upon another,\r\nfrom eight to sixteen in number in one length. The surface of the earth\r\nlooked like a yellow-washed wall; for it had been a very dry summer; and\r\nthere was not any thing that I could see green, except the pine trees in\r\nthe woods, and the cedars, which made a truly picturesque view as we\r\nsailed up the Potomac. It is indeed a most beautiful river.\r\n\r\nWhen we arrived at Mount Vernon, I found that General Washington was at\r\nPhiladelphia; but his steward[9] had orders from the General to receive\r\nme and my family, with all the horses, cattle, &c. which I had on board.\r\nA boat was, therefore, got ready for landing them; but that could not be\r\ndone, as the ship must be cleared out at some port before anything was\r\nmoved: so, after looking about a few minutes at Mount Vernon, I returned\r\nto the ship, and we began to make way for Alexandria....\r\n\r\n[9] No doubt Anderson, Washington's last manager.\r\n\r\nWhen I had been about seven days at Alexandria, I hired a horse and went\r\nto Mount Vernon, to view my intended farm; of which General Washington\r\nhad given me a plan, and a report along with it--the rent being fixed at\r\neighteen hundred bushels of wheat for twelve hundred acres, or money\r\naccording to the price of that grain. I must confess that if he would\r\nhave given me the inheritance of the land for that sum, I durst not have\r\naccepted it, especially with the incumbrances upon it; viz. one hundred\r\nseventy slaves young and old, and out of that number only\r\ntwenty-seven[10] in a condition to work, as the steward represented to\r\nme. I viewed the whole of the cultivated estate--about three thousand\r\nacres; and afterward dined with Mrs. Washington and the family. Here I\r\nmet a Doctor Thornton, who is a very pleasant agreeable man, and his\r\nlady; with a Mr. Peters and his lady, who was a grand-daughter of Mrs.\r\nWashington. Doctor Thornton living at the city of Washington, he gave me\r\nan invitation to visit him there: he was one of the commissioners of\r\nthe city.\r\n\r\n[10] Most certainly a mistake.\r\n\r\nI slept at Mount Vernon, and experienced a very kind and comfortable\r\nreception; but did not like the land at all. I saw no green grass there,\r\nexcept in the garden: and this was some English grass, appearing to me\r\nto be a sort of couch-grass; it was in drills. There were also six\r\nsaintfoin plants, which I found the General valued highly. I viewed the\r\noats which were not thrashed, and counted the grains upon each head; but\r\nfound no stem with more than four grains, and these a very light and bad\r\nquality, such as I had never seen before: the longest straw was of about\r\ntwelve inches. The wheat was all thrashed, therefore I could not\r\nascertain the produce of that: I saw some of the straw, however, and\r\nthought it had been cut and prepared for the cattle in the winter; but I\r\nbelieve I was mistaken, it being short by nature, and with thrashing out\r\nlooked like chaff, or as if chopped with a bad knife. The General had\r\ntwo thrashing machines, the power given by horses. The clover was very\r\nlittle in bulk, and like chaff; not more than nine inches long, and the\r\nleaf very much shed from the stalk. By the stubbles on the land I could\r\nnot tell which had been wheat, or which had been oats or barley; nor\r\ncould I see any clover-roots where the clover had grown. The weather was\r\nhot and dry at that time; it was in December. The whole of the different\r\nfields were covered with either the stalks of weeds, corn-stalks, or\r\nwhat is called sedge--something like spear-grass upon the poor limestone\r\nin England; and the steward told me nothing would eat it, which is true.\r\nIndeed, he found fault with everything, just like a foreigner; and even\r\ntold me many unpleasant tales of the General, so that I began to think\r\nhe feared I was coming to take his place. But (God knows!) I would not\r\nchoose to accept of it: for he had to superintend four hundred slaves,\r\nand there would be more now. This part of his business especially would\r\nhave been painful to me; it is, in fact, a sort of trade of itself.\r\n\r\nI had not in all this time seen what we in England call a corn-stack,\r\nnor a dung-hill. There were, indeed, behind the General's barns, two or\r\nthree cocks of oats and barley; but such as an English broad-wheeled\r\nwaggon would have carried a hundred miles at one time with ease. Neither\r\nhad I seen a green plant of any kind: there was some clover of the first\r\nyear's sowing: but in riding over the fields I should not have known it\r\nto be clover, although the steward told me it was; only when I came\r\nunder a tree I could, by favour of the shade, perceive here and there a\r\ngreen leaf of clover, but I do not remember seeing a green root. I was\r\nshown no grass-hay of any kind; nor do I believe there was any.\r\n\r\nThe cattle were very poor and ordinary, and the sheep the same; nor did\r\nI see any thing I liked except the mules, which were very fine ones, and\r\nin good condition. Mr. Gough had made a present to General Washington of\r\na bull calf. The animal was shown to me when I first landed at Mount\r\nVernon, and was the first bull I saw in the country. He was large, and\r\nvery strong-featured; the largest part was his head, the next his legs.\r\nThe General's steward was a Scotchman, and no judge of animals--a better\r\njudge of distilling whiskey.\r\n\r\nI saw here a greater number of negroes than I ever saw at one time,\r\neither before or since.\r\n\r\nThe house is a very decent mansion: not large, and something like a\r\ngentleman's house in England, with gardens and plantations; and is very\r\nprettily situated on the banks of the river Potowmac, with extensive\r\nprospects.... The roads are very bad from Alexandria to Mount Vernon.\r\n\r\nThe General still continuing at Philadelphia, I could not have the\r\npleasure of seeing him; therefore I returned to Alexandria.\r\n\r\nI returned [to Mount Vernon some weeks later] ... to see General\r\nWashington. I dined with him; and he showed me several presents that had\r\nbeen sent him, viz. swords, china, and among the rest the key of the\r\nBastille. I spent a very pleasant day in the house, as the weather was\r\nso severe that there were no farming objects to see, the ground being\r\ncovered with snow.\r\n\r\nWould General Washington have given me the twelve hundred acres I would\r\nnot have accepted it, to have been confined to live in that country; and\r\nto convince the General of the cause of my determination, I was\r\ncompelled to treat him with a great deal of frankness. The General, who\r\nhad corresponded with Mr. Arthur Young and others on the subject of\r\nEnglish farming and soils, and had been not a little flattered by\r\ndifferent gentlemen from England, seemed at first to be not well\r\npleased with my conversation; but I gave him some strong proofs of his\r\nmistakes, by making a comparison between the lands in America and those\r\nof England in two respects.\r\n\r\nFirst, in the article of sheep. He supposed himself to have fine sheep,\r\nand a great quantity of them. At the time of my viewing his five farms,\r\nwhich consisted of about three thousand acres cultivated, he had one\r\nhundred sheep, and those in very poor condition. This was in the month\r\nof November. To show him his mistake in the value and quality of his\r\nland, I compared this with the farm my father occupied, which was less\r\nthan six hundred acres. He clipped eleven hundred sheep, though some of\r\nhis land was poor and at two shillings and sixpence per acre--the\r\nhighest was at twenty shillings; the average weight of the wool was ten\r\npounds per fleece, and the carcases weighed from eighty to one hundred\r\ntwenty pounds each: while in the General's hundred sheep on three\r\nthousand acres, the wool would not weigh on an average more than three\r\npounds and a half the fleece, and the carcases at forty-eight pounds\r\neach. Secondly, the proportion of the produce in grain was similar. The\r\nGeneral's crops were from two to three[11] bushels of wheat per acre;\r\nand my father's farm, although poor clay soil, gave from twenty to\r\nthirty bushels.\r\n\r\n[11] A misstatement, of course.\r\n\r\nDuring this conversation Colonel Lear, aide-de-camp to the General, was\r\npresent. When the General left the room, the Colonel told me he had\r\nhimself been in England, and had seen Arthur Young (who had been\r\nfrequently named by the General in our conversation); and that Mr. Young\r\nhaving learnt that he was in the mercantile line, and was possessed of\r\nmuch land, had said he thought he was a great fool to be a merchant and\r\nyet have so much land; the Colonel replied, that if Mr. Young had the\r\nsame land to cultivate, it would make a great fool of _him_. The Colonel\r\ndid me the honour to say I was the only man he ever knew to treat\r\nGeneral Washington with frankness.\r\n\r\nThe General's cattle at that time were all in poor condition: except his\r\nmules (bred from American mares), which were very fine, and the Spanish\r\nass sent to him as a present by the king of Spain. I felt myself much\r\nvexed at an expression used at dinner by Mrs. Washington. When the\r\nGeneral and the company at table were talking about the fine horses and\r\ncattle I had brought from England, Mrs. Washington said, \"I am afraid,\r\nMr. Parkinson, you have brought your fine horses and cattle to a bad\r\nmarket; I am of opinion that our horses and cattle are good enough for\r\nour land.\" I thought that if every old woman in the country knew this,\r\nmy speculation would answer very ill: as I perfectly agreed with Mrs.\r\nWashington in sentiment; and wondered much, from the poverty of the\r\nland, to see the cattle good as they were.\r\n\r\nThe General wished me to stay all night; but having some other\r\nengagement, I declined his kind offer. He sent Colonel Lear out after I\r\nhad parted with him, to ask me if I wanted any money; which I\r\ngladly accepted.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVI\r\n\r\n\r\nPROFIT AND LOSS\r\n\r\nA biographer whose opinions about Washington are usually sound concludes\r\nthat the General was a failure as a farmer. With this opinion I am\r\nunable to agree and I am inclined to think that in forming it he had in\r\nmind temporary financial stringencies and perhaps a comparison between\r\nWashington and the scientific farmers of to-day instead of the juster\r\ncomparison with the farmers of that day. For if Washington was a\r\nfailure, then nine-tenths of the Southern planters of his day were also\r\nfailures, for their methods and results were much worse than his.\r\n\r\nIt must be admitted, however, that comparatively little of his fortune,\r\nwhich amounted at his death to perhaps three-quarters of a million\r\ndollars, was made by the sale of products from his farm. Few farmers\r\nhave grown rich in that way. Washington's wealth was due in part to\r\ninheritance and a fortunate marriage, but most of all to the increment\r\non land. Part of this land he received as a reward for military\r\nservices, but much of it he was shrewd enough to buy at a low rate and\r\nhold until it became more valuable.\r\n\r\nThe task of analyzing his fortune and income in detail is an impossible\r\none for a number of reasons. We do not have all the facts of his\r\nfinancial operations and even if we had there are other difficulties. A\r\nfarmer, unlike a salaried man, can not tell with any exactness what his\r\ntrue income is. The salaried man can say, \"This year I received four\r\nthousand dollars,\" The farmer can only say--if he is the one in a\r\nhundred who keeps accounts--\"Last year I took in two thousand dollars or\r\nfive thousand dollars,\" as the case may be. From this sum he must deduct\r\nexpenses for labor, wear and tear of farm machinery, pro rata cost of\r\nnew tools and machinery, loss of soil fertility, must take into account\r\nthe fact that some of the stock sold has been growing for one, two or\r\nmore years, must allow for the butter and eggs bartered for groceries\r\nand for the value of the two cows he traded for a horse, must add the\r\nvalue of the rent of the house and grounds he and his family have\r\nenjoyed, the value of the chickens, eggs, vegetables, fruit, milk, meat\r\nand other produce of the farm consumed--as he proceeds the problem\r\nbecomes infinitely more complex until at last he gives it up\r\nas hopeless.\r\n\r\nThis much, however, is plain--a farmer can handle much less money than a\r\nsalaried man and yet live infinitely better, for his rent, much of his\r\nfood and many other things cost him nothing.\r\n\r\nIn Washington's case the problem is further complicated by a number of\r\ncircumstances. As a result of his marriage he had some money upon bond.\r\nFor his military services in the French war he received large grants of\r\nland and the payment during the Revolution of his personal expenses, and\r\nas President he had a salary of twenty-five thousand dollars a year.\r\n\r\nYet another difficulty discloses itself when we come to examine his cash\r\naccounts. We find, for example, that from August 3, 1775, to September,\r\n1783, leaving out of the reckoning his military receipts, he took in a\r\ntotal of about eighty thousand one hundred sixty-seven pounds. What then\r\nmore simple than to divide this sum by seven and ascertain his average\r\nreceipts during the years of the Revolution? But when we come to examine\r\nsome of the details more closely we are brought to pause. We discover\r\nsuch facts as that in 1780 a small steer, supposed to weigh about three\r\nhundred pounds, brought five hundred pounds in money! A sheep sold for\r\none hundred pounds; six thousand five hundred sixty-nine pounds of\r\ndressed beef brought six thousand five hundred sixty-nine pounds; the\r\nstud fee for \"Steady\" was sixty pounds. In other words, the accounts in\r\nthese years were in depreciated paper and utterly worthless for our\r\npurposes. Washington himself gave the puzzle up in despair toward the\r\nend of the war and paid his manager in produce, not money.\r\n\r\nWe of to-day have, in fact, not the faintest conception of the blessing\r\nwe enjoy in a uniform and fairly stable monetary system. Even before the\r\ndays of the \"Continentals\" there was depreciated paper afloat that had\r\nbeen issued by the colonial governments and, unless the fact is\r\ndefinitely stated, when we come upon figures of that period we can never\r\nbe sure whether they refer to pounds sterling or pounds paper, or, if\r\nthe latter, what kind of paper. People had to be constantly figuring the\r\nreal value of Pennsylvania money, or Virginia money or Massachusetts\r\nmoney, and one meets with many such calculations on the blank leaves of\r\nWashington's account books. Even metallic money was a Chinese puzzle\r\nexcept to the initiated, there were so many kinds of it afloat. Among\r\nour Farmer's papers I have found a list of the money that he took with\r\nhim to Philadelphia on one occasion--6 joes, 67 half joes, 2\r\none-eighteenth joes, 3 doubloons, 1 pistole, 2 moidores, 1 half moidore,\r\n2 double louis d'or, 3 single louis d'or, 80 guineas, 7 half guineas,\r\nbesides silver and bank-notes.\r\n\r\nThe depreciation of the paper currency during the Revolution proved\r\ndisastrous to him in several ways. When the war broke out much of the\r\nmoney he had obtained by marriage was loaned out on bond, or, as we\r\nwould say to-day, on mortgage. \"I am now receiving,\" he soon wrote, \"a\r\nshilling in the pound in discharge of Bonds which ought to have been\r\npaid me, & would have been realized before I left Virginia, but for my\r\nindulgences to the debtors.\" In 1778 he said that six or seven thousand\r\npounds that he had in bonds upon interest had been paid in depreciated\r\npaper, so that the real value was now reduced to as many hundreds. Some\r\nof the paper money that came into his hands he invested in government\r\nsecurities, and at least ten thousand pounds of these in Virginia money\r\nwere ultimately funded by the federal government for six thousand two\r\nhundred and forty-six dollars in three and six per cent. bonds.\r\n\r\nAnd yet, by examining Washington's accounts, one is able to estimate in\r\na rough way the returns he received from his estate, landed and\r\notherwise. We find that in ten months of 1759 he took in £1,839; from\r\nJanuary 1, 1760, to January 10, 1761, about £2,535; in 1772, £3,213;\r\nfrom August 3, 1775, to August 30, 1776, £2,119; in 1786, £2,025; in\r\n1791, about £2,025. Included in some of these entries, particularly the\r\nearlier ones, are payments of interest and principal on his wife's share\r\nof the Custis estate. Of the later ones, that for 1786--a bad farming\r\nyear--includes rentals on more than a score of parcels of land amounting\r\nto £282.15, £25 rental on his fishery, payments for flour, stud\r\nfees, etc.\r\n\r\nUpon the average, therefore, I am inclined to believe that his annual\r\nreceipts were roughly in the neighborhood of ten thousand dollars to\r\nfifteen thousand dollars a year from his estate.\r\n\r\nAs regards Mount Vernon alone, he sometimes made estimates of what the\r\ncrop returns ought to be; in other words, counted his chickens before\r\nthey were hatched. Thus in 1789 he drew up alternative plans and\r\nestimated that one of these, if adopted, ought to produce crops worth a\r\ngross of £3,091, another £3,831, and a third £4,449, but that from these\r\nsums £1,357, £1,394 and £1,445 respectively would have to be deducted\r\nfor seed, food for man and beasts, and other expenses.\r\n\r\nA much better idea of the financial returns from his home estate can be\r\nobtained from his actual balances of gain and loss. One of these, namely\r\nfor 1798, which was a poor year, was as follows:\r\n\r\nBALANCE OF GAIN AND LOSS, 1798\r\n\r\nDR. GAINED                           CR.

Yet the profit Washington sets down is about seven\r\nper cent. upon sixty-five thousand dollars, and seven per cent. is more\r\nthan the average farmer makes off his farm to-day except through the\r\nappreciation in the value of the land. The truth is, however, that Mount\r\nVernon, including the live stock and slaves, was really worth in 1798\r\nnearer two hundred thousand dollars than sixty-five thousand, so that\r\nthe actual return would only be about two and a fourth per cent.\r\n\r\nBut Washington failed to include in his receipts many items, such as the\r\nuse of a fine mansion for himself and family, the use of horses and\r\nvehicles, and the added value of slaves and live stock by\r\nnatural increase.\r\n\r\nBesides in some other years the profits were much larger.\r\n\r\nAnd lastly, in judging a man's success or failure as a farmer, allowance\r\nmust be made for the kind of land that he has to farm. The Mount Vernon\r\nland was undoubtedly poor in quality, and it is probable that Washington\r\ngot more out of it than has ever been got out of it by any other person\r\neither before or since. Much of it to-day must not pay taxes.\r\n\r\nWashington died possessed of property worth about three-quarters of a\r\nmillion, although he began life glad to earn a doubloon a day surveying.\r\nThe main sources of this wealth have already been indicated, but when\r\nall allowance is made in these respects, the fact remains that he was\r\ncompelled to make a living and to keep expenses paid during the forty\r\nyears in which the fortune was accumulating, and the main source he drew\r\nfrom was his farms. Not much of that living came from the Custis estate,\r\nfor, as we have seen, a large part of the money thus acquired was lost.\r\nDuring his eight years as Commander-in-Chief he had his expenses--no\r\nmore. Of the eight years of his presidency much the same can be said,\r\nfor all authorities agree that he expended all of his salary in\r\nmaintaining his position and some say that he spent more. Yet at the end\r\nof his life we find him with much more land than he had in 1760, with\r\nvaluable stocks and bonds, a house and furniture infinitely superior to\r\nthe eight-room house he first owned, two houses in the Federal City that\r\nhad cost him about $15,000, several times as many negroes, and live\r\nstock estimated by himself at $15,653 and by his manager at upward of\r\ntwice that sum.\r\n\r\nSuch being the case--and as no one has ever ventured even to hint that\r\nhe made money corruptly out of his official position--the conclusion is\r\nirresistible that he was a good business man and that he made farming\r\npay, particularly when he was at home.\r\n\r\nIt is true that only three months before his death he wrote: \"The\r\nexpense at which I live, and the unproductiveness of my estate, will not\r\nallow me to lessen my income while I remain in my present situation. On\r\nthe contrary, were it not for occasional supplies of money in payment\r\nfor lands sold within the last four or five years, to the amount of\r\nupwards of fifty thousand dollars, I should not be able to support the\r\nformer without involving myself in debt and difficulties,\" This must be\r\ntaken, however, to apply to a single period of heavy expense when\r\nforeign complications and other causes rendered farming unprofitable,\r\nrather than to his whole career. Furthermore, his landed investments\r\nfrom which he could draw no returns were so heavy that he had approached\r\nthe condition of being land poor and it was only proper that he should\r\ncut loose from some of them.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVII\r\n\r\n\r\nODDS AND ENDS\r\n\r\nIn an age when organized charity was almost unknown the burden of such\r\nwork fell mainly upon individuals. Being a man of great prominence and\r\nknown to be wealthy, the proprietor of Mount Vernon was the recipient of\r\nmany requests for assistance. Ministers wrote to beg money to rebuild\r\nchurches or to convert the heathen; old soldiers wrote to ask for money\r\nto relieve family distresses or to use in business; from all classes and\r\nsections poured in requests for aid, financial and otherwise.\r\n\r\nIt was inevitable that among these requests there should be some that\r\nwere unusual. Perhaps the most amusing that I have discovered is one\r\nwritten by a young man named Thomas Bruff, from the Fountain Inn,\r\nGeorgetown. He states that this is his second letter, but I have not\r\nfound the first. In the letter we have he sets forth that he has lost\r\nall his property and desires a loan of five hundred pounds. His need is\r\nurgent, for he is engaged to a beautiful and \"amiable\" young lady,\r\npossessed of an \"Estate that will render me Independent. Whom I cannot\r\nMarry in my present situation.... All my Happyness is now depending upon\r\nyour Goodness and without your kind assistance I must be forever\r\nmiserable--I should have never thought of making application to you for\r\nthis favor had it not been in Consequence of a vision by Night since my\r\nFathers Death who appeared to me in a Dream in my Misfortunes three\r\ntimes in one Night telling me to make applycation to you for Money and\r\nthat you would relieve me from my distresses. He appeared the other\r\nnight again and asked me if I had obeyed his commands I informed him\r\nthat I had Wrote to you some time ago but had Received no answer nor no\r\ninformation Relative to the Business he then observed that he expected\r\nmy letter had not come to hand and toald me to Write again I made some\r\nObjections at first and toald him I thought it presumption in me to\r\ntrouble your Excellency again on the subject he then in a Rage drew his\r\nSmall Sword and toald me if I did not he would run me through. I\r\nimmediately in a fright consented.\"\r\n\r\nOne might suppose that so ingenious a request, picturing the deadly\r\ndanger in which a young man stood from the shade of his progenitor,\r\nespecially a young man who was thereby forced to keep a young lady\r\nwaiting, would have aroused Washington's most generous impulses and\r\ncaused him to send perhaps double the amount desired. Possibly he was\r\nhard up at the time. At all events he indorsed the letter thus:\r\n\r\n\"Without date and without success.\"\r\n\r\nMany times, however, our Farmer was open-handed to persons who had no\r\npersonal claim on him. For example, he loaned three hundred and two\r\npounds to his old comrade of the French War--Robert Stewart--the purpose\r\nbeing to buy a commission in the British army. So far as I can discover\r\nit was never repaid; in fact, I am not sure but that he intended it as a\r\ngift. Another advance was that made to Charles L. Carter, probably the\r\nyoung man who later married a daughter of Washington's sister, Betty\r\nLewis. Most of the story is told in the following extract from a letter\r\nwritten by Carter from Fredericksburg, June 2, 1797:\r\n\r\n\"With diffidence I now address you in consequence of having failed after\r\nmy first voyage from China, to return the two hundred Dollars you\r\nfavored me with the Loan of. Be assured Dr. Sir that I left goods unsold\r\nat the time of my Departure from Philadelphia on the second voyage, &\r\ndirected that the money arising therefrom should be paid to you, but the\r\nintegrity of my agent did not prove to be so uncorrupted as I had\r\nflattered myself. I have, at this late period, sent by Mr. G. Tevis the\r\nsum of two hundred Dollars with interest therefrom from the 15th of\r\nMarch 1795 to the 1st June, 1797. That sum has laid the foundation of a\r\npretty fortune, for which I shall ever feel myself indebted to you.\"\r\n\r\nHe added that he had been refused the loan by a near relation before\r\nWashington had so kindly obliged him and that his mother, who was\r\nevidently acquainted with Washington, joined in hearty thanks for the\r\nbenefit received.\r\n\r\nWashington had experienced enough instances of ingratitude to be much\r\npleased with the outcome of this affair. He replied in the kindest\r\nterms, but declined to receive the interest, saying that he had not made\r\nthe loan as an investment and that he did not desire a profit from it.\r\n\r\nAnother recipient of Washington's bounty was his old neighbor, Captain\r\nJohn Posey. Posey sold Washington not only his Ferry Farm but also his\r\nclaim to western lands. He became financially embarrassed, in fact,\r\nruined; his family was scattered, and he made frequent applications to\r\nWashington for advice and assistance. Washington helped to educate a\r\nson, St. Lawrence, who had been reduced to the hard expedient of tending\r\nbar in a tavern, and he also kept a daughter, Milly, at Mount Vernon,\r\nperhaps as a sort of companion to Mrs. Washington. The Captain\r\nonce wrote:\r\n\r\n\"I could [have] been able to [have] Satisfied all my old Arrears, some\r\nmonths AGoe, by marrying [an] old widow woman in this County. She has\r\nlarge soms [of] cash by her, and Prittey good Est.--She is as thick as\r\nshe is high---And gits drunk at Least three or foure [times] a\r\nweak---which is Disagreable to me--has Viliant Sperrit when Drunk--its\r\nbeen [a] great Dispute in my mind what to Doe,--I beleave I shu'd Run\r\nall Resks--if my Last wife, had been [an] Even temper'd woman, but her\r\nSperrit, has Given me such [a] Shock--that I am afraid to Run the\r\nResk again.\"\r\n\r\nEvidently the Captain did not find a way out of his troubles by the\r\nmatrimonial route, for somewhat later he was in jail at Queenstown,\r\npresumably for debt, and we find in one of Washington's cash memorandum\r\nbooks under date of October 15, 1773: \"By Charity--given Captn. Posey,\"\r\nfour pounds. One of the sons later settled in Indiana, and the \"Pocket\"\r\ncounty is named after him.\r\n\r\nAnother boy toward whose education Washington contributed was the son of\r\nDoctor James Craik--the boy being a namesake. Doctor Craik was one of\r\nWashington's oldest and dearest friends. He was born in Scotland two\r\nyears before Washington saw the light at Wakefield, graduated from\r\nEdinburgh University, practised medicine in the West Indies for a short\r\ntime and then came to Virginia. He was Washington's comrade in arms in\r\nthe Fort Necessity campaign, was subsequently surgeon general in the\r\nContinental Army, and accompanied Washington to the Ohio both in 1770\r\nand 1784. He married Mariane Ewell, a relative of Washington's mother,\r\nand resided many years in Alexandria. He was a frequent visitor at Mount\r\nVernon both as a friend and in a professional capacity, and Washington\r\ndeclared that he would rather trust him than a dozen other doctors. Few\r\nmen were so close to the great man as he, and he was one of the few who\r\nin his letters ventured to tell chatty matters of gossip. Thus, in\r\nAugust, 1791, he wrote a letter apropos of the bad health of George A.\r\nWashington and added: \"My daughter Nancy is there [Mt. Vernon] by way of\r\nAmusement awhile. She begins to be tired of her Fathers house and I\r\nbelieve intends taking an old Batchelor Mr. Hn. for a mate shortly.\"\r\nAnother young lady, Miss Muir, who had recently gone to Long Island for\r\nthe benefit of the sea baths was \"pursued\" by a Mr. Donaldson and the\r\nlatter now writes that \"he shall bring back a wife with him.\" Craik was\r\na thorough believer in Washington's destiny, and in the dark days of the\r\nRevolution would hearten up his comrades by the story of the Indian\r\nchieftain met upon the Ohio in 1770 who had vainly tried to kill\r\nWashington in the battle of the Monongahela and had finally desisted in\r\nthe belief that he was invulnerable.\r\n\r\nTo friends, family, church, education and strangers our Farmer was\r\nopen-handed beyond most men of his time. His manager had orders to fill\r\na corn-house every year for the sole use of the poor in the neighborhood\r\nand this saved numbers of poor women and children from extreme want. He\r\nalso allowed the honest poor to make use of his fishing stations,\r\nfurnishing them with all necessary apparatus for taking herring, and if\r\nthey were unequal to the task of hauling the seine, assistance was\r\nrendered them by the General's servants.\r\n\r\nTo Lund Washington he wrote from the camp at Cambridge: \"Let the\r\nhospitality of the house, with respect to the poor, be kept up. Let no\r\none go hungry away. If any of this kind of people should be in want of\r\ncorn, supply their necessaries, provided that it does not encourage them\r\nto idleness; and I have no objection to you giving my money in charity\r\nto the amount of forty or fifty pounds a year, when you think it well\r\nbestowed. What I mean by having no objection is, that it is my desire it\r\nshould be done. You are to consider that neither _myself nor wife_ is\r\nnow in the way to do these good offices.\"\r\n\r\nHis relations with his own kindred were patriarchal in character. His\r\ncare of Mrs. Washington's children and grandchildren has already been\r\ndescribed. He gave a phaeton and money to the extent of two thousand\r\nfive hundred dollars to his mother and did not claim possession of some\r\nof the land left him by his father's will. To his sister Betty Lewis he\r\ngave a mule and many other presents, as well as employment to several of\r\nher sons. He loaned his brother Samuel (five times married)\r\nconsiderable sums, which he forgave in his will, spent \"near five\r\nthousand dollars\" on the education of two of his sons, and cared for\r\nseveral years for a daughter Harriot, notwithstanding the fact that she\r\nhad \"no disposition ... to be careful of her cloaths.\" To his nephew,\r\nBushrod Washington, he gave money and helped him to obtain a legal\r\neducation, and he assisted another nephew, George A. Washington, and his\r\nwidow and children, in ways already mentioned. Over forty relatives were\r\nremembered in his will, many of them in a most substantial manner.\r\n\r\nIn the matter of eating and drinking Washington was abstemious. For\r\nbreakfast he ordinarily had tea and Indian cakes with butter and perhaps\r\nhoney, of which he was very fond. His supper was equally light,\r\nconsisting of perhaps tea and toast, with wine, and he usually retired\r\npromptly at nine o'clock. Dinner was the main meal of the day at Mount\r\nVernon, and was served punctually at two o'clock. One such meal is thus\r\ndescribed by a guest:\r\n\r\n\"He thanked us, desired us to be seated, and to excuse him a few\r\nmoments.... The President came and desired us to walk in to dinner and\r\ndirected us where to sit, (no grace was said).... The dinner was very\r\ngood, a small roasted pigg, boiled leg of lamb, roasted fowls, beef,\r\npeas, lettice, cucumbers, artichokes, etc., puddings, tarts, etc. etc.\r\nWe were desired to call for what drink we chose. He took a glass of wine\r\nwith Mrs. Law first, which example was followed by Dr. Croker Crakes and\r\nMrs. Washington, myself and Mrs. Peters, Mr. Fayette and the young lady\r\nwhose name is Custis. When the cloth was taken away the President gave\r\n'all our Friends.'\"\r\n\r\nThe General ordinarily confined himself to a few courses and if offered\r\nanything very rich would reply, \"That is too good for me.\" He often\r\ndrank beer with the meal, with one or two glasses of wine and perhaps as\r\nmany more afterward, often eating nuts, another delicacy with him, as he\r\nsipped the wine.\r\n\r\nHe was, in fact, no prohibitionist, but he was a strong believer in\r\ntemperance. He and the public men of his time, being aristocrats, were\r\nwine drinkers and few of them were drunkards. The political revolution\r\nof 1830, ushered in by Jackson, brought in a different type--Westerners\r\nwho drank whisky and brandy, with the result that drunkenness in public\r\nstation was much more common. Many of the Virginia gentlemen of\r\nWashington's day spent a fourth or even a third of their income upon\r\ntheir cellars. He was no exception to the rule, and from his papers we\r\ndiscover many purchases of wine. One of the last bills of lading I have\r\nnoticed among his papers is a bill for \"Two pipes of fine old London\r\nparticular Madeira Wine,\" shipped to him from the island of Madeira,\r\nSeptember 20, 1799. One wonders whether he got to toast \"All our\r\nFriends\" out of it before he died.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: One of Washington's Tavern Bills]\r\n\r\nHis sideboard and table were well equipped with glasses and silver wine\r\ncoolers of the most expensive construction. As in many other matters,\r\nhis inventive bent turned in this direction. Having noticed the\r\nconfusion that often arose from the passing of the bottles about the\r\ntable he designed when President a sort of silver caster capable of\r\nholding four bottles. They were used with great success on state\r\noccasions and were so convenient that other people adopted the\r\ninvention, so that wine _coasters_, after the Washington design, became\r\na part of the furniture of every fashionable sideboard.\r\n\r\nTo cool wine, meat and other articles, Washington early adopted the\r\npractice of putting up ice, a thing then unusual. In January, 1785, he\r\nprepared a dry well under the summer house and also one in his new\r\ncellar and in due time had both filled. June fifth he \"Opened the well\r\nin my Cellar in which I had laid up a store of Ice, but there was not\r\nthe smallest particle remaining.--I then opened the other Repository\r\n(call the dry Well) in which I found a large store.\" Later he erected an\r\nice house to the eastward of the flower garden.\r\n\r\nHis experience with the cellar well was hardly less successful than that\r\nof his friend, James Madison, on a like occasion. Madison had an ice\r\nhouse filled with ice, and a skeptical overseer wagered a turkey against\r\na mint julep that by the fourth of July the ice would all have\r\ndisappeared. The day came, they opened the house, and behold there was\r\nenough ice for exactly _one_ julep! Truly a sad situation when there\r\nwere _two_ Virginia gentlemen.\r\n\r\nMention of Madison in this connection calls to mind the popular notion\r\nthat it was his wife Dolly who invented ice-cream. I believe that her\r\nbiographers claim for her the credit of the discovery. The rôle of the\r\niconoclast is a thankless one and I confess to a liking for Dolly, but I\r\nhave discovered in Washington's cash memorandum book under date of May\r\n17, 1784, the entry: \"By a Cream Machine for Ice,\" £1.13.4--that is an\r\nice-cream freezer. The immortal Dolly was then not quite twelve\r\nyears old.\r\n\r\nWashington seems to have owned three coaches. The first he ordered in\r\nLondon in 1758 in preparation for his marriage. It was to be\r\nfashionable, genteel and of seasoned wood; the body preferably green,\r\nwith a light gilding on the mouldings, with other suitable ornaments\r\nincluding the Washington arms. It was sent with high recommendations,\r\nbut proved to be of badly seasoned material, so that the panels shrunk\r\nand slipped out of the mouldings within two months and split from end to\r\nend, much to his disgust. Such a chariot was driven not with lines from\r\na driver's box, but by liveried postillions riding on horseback, one\r\nhorseman to each span.\r\n\r\nThe second coach he had made in Philadelphia in 1780 at a cost of two\r\nhundred and ten pounds in specie. It was decidedly better built.\r\n\r\nThe last was a coach, called \"the White Chariot,\" bought second hand\r\nsoon after he became President. It was built by Clarke, of Philadelphia,\r\nand was a fine vehicle, with a cream-colored body and wheels, green\r\nVenetian blinds and the Washington arms painted upon the doors. In this\r\ncoach, drawn by six horses, he drove out in state at Philadelphia and\r\nrode to and from Mount Vernon, occasionally suffering an upset on the\r\nwretched roads. It was strong and of good workmanship and its maker\r\nheard with pride that it had made the long southern tour of 1791 without\r\nstarting a nail or a screw. This coach was purchased at the sale of the\r\nGeneral's effects by George Washington Parke Custis and later in a\r\ncurious manner fell into the possession of Bishop Meade, who ultimately\r\nmade it up into walking sticks, picture frames, snuff boxes and such\r\nmementoes.\r\n\r\nAt Mount Vernon to-day the visitor is shown a coach which the official\r\nHandbook states is vouched for as the original \"White Chariot.\" In\r\nreality it seems to be the coach once owned by the Powell family of\r\nPhiladelphia. It is said to have been built by the same maker and on the\r\nsame lines, and Washington may have ridden in it, but it never\r\nbelonged to him.\r\n\r\nMost people think of Washington as a marble statue on a pedestal rather\r\nthan as a being of flesh and blood with human feelings, faults and\r\nvirtues. He was self-contained, he was not voluble, he had a sense of\r\npersonal dignity, but underneath he was not cold. He was really\r\nhot-tempered and on a few well-authenticated occasions fell into\r\npassions in which he used language that would have blistered the steel\r\nsides of a dreadnaught. Yet he was kind-hearted, he pitied the weak and\r\nsorrowful, and the list of his quiet benefactions would fill many pages\r\nand cost him thousands of pounds. He was even full of sentiment in some\r\nmatters; on more than one occasion he provided positions that enabled\r\nyoung friends or relatives to marry, and I shrewdly suspect that he\r\nengineered matters so that the beloved Nelly Custis obtained a good\r\nhusband in the person of his nephew, Lawrence Lewis. I might say much\r\nmore tending to show his human qualities, but I shall add only this:\r\nHaving for many years studied his career from every imaginable point of\r\nview, I give it as my deliberate opinion that perhaps no man ever lived\r\nwho was more considerate of the rights and feelings of others. Not even\r\nLincoln had a bigger heart.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVIII\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE VALE OF SUNSET\r\n\r\nWashington looked forward to the end of his presidency as does \"the\r\nweariest traveler, who sees a resting-place, and is bending his body to\r\nlay thereon.\" \"Methought I heard him say, 'Ay.' I am fairly out, and you\r\nare fairly in; see which of us is the happiest,\" wrote John Adams to his\r\nwife Abigail. And from Mount Vernon Nelly Custis informed a friend that\r\n\"grandpapa is very well and much pleased with being once more Farmer\r\nWashington.\"\r\n\r\nThe eight years of toilsome work, which had been rendered all the harder\r\nby much bitter criticism, had aged him greatly and this helped to make\r\nhim doubly anxious to return to the peace and quiet of home for his\r\nfinal days. And yet he was affected by his parting from his friends and\r\nassociates. A few partisan enemies openly rejoiced at his departure, but\r\nthere were not wanting abundant evidences of the people's reverence and\r\nlove for him. It is a source of satisfaction to us now that his\r\ncontemporaries realized he was one of the great figures of history and\r\nthat they did not withhold the tribute of their praise until after his\r\ndeath. As we turn the thousands of manuscripts that make up his papers\r\nwe come upon scores of private letters and public resolutions in which,\r\nin terms often a bit stilted but none the less sincere, a country's\r\ngratitude is laid at the feet of its benefactor.\r\n\r\nThe Mount Vernon to which he returned was perhaps in better condition\r\nthan was that to which he retired at the end of the Revolution, for he\r\nhad been able each summer to give the estate some personal oversight;\r\nnevertheless it was badly run down and there was much to occupy his\r\nattention. In April he wrote: \"We are in the midst of litter and dirt,\r\noccasioned by joiners, masons, painters, and upholsterers, working in\r\nthe house, all parts of which, as well as the outbuildings, are much out\r\nof repair.\"\r\n\r\nAnderson remained with him, but Washington gave personal attention to\r\nmany matters and exercised a general oversight over everything. Like\r\nmost good farmers he \"began his diurnal course with the sun,\" and if\r\nhis slaves and hirelings were not in place by that time he sent \"them\r\nmessages of sorrow for their indisposition.\" Having set the wheels of\r\nthe estate in motion, he breakfasted. \"This being over, I mount my horse\r\nand ride around my farms, which employs me until it is time for dinner,\r\nat which I rarely miss seeing strange faces.... The usual time of\r\nsitting at table, a walk, and tea bring me within the dawn of\r\ncandlelight; previous to which, if not prevented by company, I resolve\r\nthat, as soon as the glimmering taper supplies the place of the great\r\nluminary, I will retire to my writing table and acknowledge the letters\r\nI have received, but when the lights are brought I feel tired and\r\ndisinclined to engage in this work, conceiving that the next night will\r\ndo as well. The next night comes, and with it the same causes of\r\npostponement, and so on.... I have not looked into a book since I came\r\nhome; nor shall I be able to do it until I have discharged my workmen,\r\nprobably not before the nights grow longer, when possibly I may be\r\nlooking in Doomsday Book.\"\r\n\r\nHe had his usual troubles with servants and crops, with delinquent\r\ntenants and other debtors; he tried Booker's threshing machine,\r\nexperimented with white Indian peas and several varieties of wheat,\r\nincluding a yellow bearded kind that was supposed to resist the fly, and\r\nbuilt two houses, or rather a double house, on property owned in the\r\nFederal City--he avoided calling the place \"Washington.\"\r\n\r\nA picture of the Farmer out upon his rounds in these last days has been\r\nleft us by his adopted son, George Washington Parke Custis. Custis\r\nrelates that one day when out with a gun he met on the forest road an\r\nelderly gentleman on horseback who inquired where he could find the\r\nGeneral. The boy told the stranger, who proved to be Colonel Meade, once\r\nof Washington's staff, that the General was abroad on the estate and\r\npointed out what direction to take to come upon him. \"You will meet,\r\nsir, with an old gentleman riding alone in plain drab clothes, a\r\nbroad-brimmed white hat, a hickory switch in his hand, and carrying an\r\numbrella with a long staff, which is attached to his saddle-bow--that\r\nperson, sir, is General Washington.\"\r\n\r\nThose were pleasant rides the old Farmer took in the early morning\r\nsunshine, with the birds singing about him, the dirt lanes soft under\r\nhis horse's feet, and in his nostrils the pure air fragrant with the\r\nscent of pines, locust blossoms or wild honeysuckle. When he grew\r\nthirsty he would pause for a drink at his favorite gum spring, and as he\r\nmade his rounds would note the progress of the miller, the coopers, the\r\ncarpenters, the fishermen, and the hands in the fields, how the corn was\r\ncoming up or the wheat was ripening, what fences needed to be renewed or\r\ngaps in hedges filled, what the increase of his cattle would be, whether\r\nthe stand of clover or buckwheat was good or not. He was the owner of\r\nall this great estate, he was proud of it; it was his home, and he was\r\nglad to be back on it once more. For he had long since realized that\r\nthere are deeper and more satisfying pleasures than winning battles or\r\nenjoying the plaudits of multitudes.\r\n\r\nAn English actor named John Bernard who happened to be in Virginia in\r\nthis period has left us a delightfully intimate picture of the Farmer on\r\nhis rounds. Bernard had ridden out below Alexandria to pay a visit and\r\non his return came upon an overturned chaise containing a man and a\r\nwoman. About the same time another horseman rode up from the opposite\r\ndirection. The two quickly ascertained that the man was unhurt and\r\nmanaged to restore the wife to consciousness, whereupon she began to\r\nupbraid her husband for carelessness.\r\n\r\n\"The horse,\" continues Bernard, \"was now on his legs, but the vehicle\r\nwas still prostrate, heavy in its frame and laden with at least half a\r\nton of luggage. My fellow-helper set me an example of activity in\r\nrelieving it of internal weight; and when all was clear we grasped the\r\nwheel between us and to the peril of our spinal columns righted the\r\nconveyance. The horse was then put in and we lent a hand to help up the\r\nluggage. All this helping, hauling and lifting occupied at least half an\r\nhour under a meridian sun, in the middle of July, which fairly boiled\r\nthe perspiration out of our foreheads.\"\r\n\r\nAfter the two Samaritans had declined a pressing invitation to go to\r\nAlexandria and have a drop of something, the unknown, a tall man past\r\nmiddle age, wearing a blue coat and buckskin breeches, exclaimed\r\nimpatiently at the heat and then \"offered very courteously,\" says\r\nBernard, \"to dust my coat, a favor the return of which enabled me to\r\ntake a deliberate survey of his person.\"\r\n\r\nThe stranger then called Bernard by name, saying that he had seen him\r\nplay in Philadelphia, and asked him to accompany him to his house and\r\nrest, at the same time pointing out a mansion on a distant hill. Not\r\ntill then did Bernard realize with whom he was speaking.\r\n\r\n\"Mt. Vernon!\" he exclaimed. \"Have I the honor of addressing General\r\nWashington?\"\r\n\r\nWith a smile Washington extended his hand and said: \"An odd sort of\r\nintroduction, Mr. Bernard; but I am pleased to find that you can play so\r\nactive a part in private and without a prompter.\"\r\n\r\nThen they rode up to the Mansion House and had a pleasant chat[12].\r\n\r\n[12] This anecdote is accepted by Mr. Lodge in his life of Washington,\r\nbut doubt is cast upon it by another historian. All that can be said is\r\nthat there is nothing to disprove it and that it is not inherently\r\nimprobable.\r\n\r\nUpon his retirement from the presidency our Farmer had told Oliver\r\nWolcott that he probably would never again go twenty miles from his own\r\nvine and fig tree, but the troubles with France resulted in a quasi-war\r\nand he was once more called from retirement to head an army, most of\r\nwhich was never raised. He accepted the appointment with the\r\nunderstanding that he was not to be called into the field unless his\r\npresence should be indispensable, but he found that he must give much\r\nof his time to the matter and be often from home, while a quarrel\r\nbetween his friends Knox and Hamilton over second place joined with\r\nRepublican hostility to war measures to add a touch of bitterness to the\r\nwork. Happily war was avoided and, though an adjustment of the\r\ninternational difficulties was not reached until 1800, Washington was\r\nable to spend most of the last months of his life at Mount Vernon\r\ncomparatively undisturbed.\r\n\r\nYet things were not as once they were. Mrs. Washington had aged greatly\r\nand was now a semi-invalid often confined to her bed. The Farmer himself\r\ncame of short-lived stock and realized that his pilgrimage would not be\r\ngreatly prolonged. Twice during the year he was seriously ill, and in\r\nSeptember was laid up for more than a week. His brother Charles died and\r\nin acknowledging the sad news he wrote:\r\n\r\n\"I was the first, and am, now, the last of my father's children by the\r\nsecond marriage, who remain.\r\n\r\n\"When I shall be _called upon to follow them_ is known only to the Giver\r\nof Life. When the summons comes, I shall endeavor to obey it with\r\ngood grace.\"\r\n\r\nAnd yet there were gleams of joy and gladness. \"About candlelight\" on\r\nhis birthday in 1799 Nelly Custis and his nephew, Lawrence Lewis, were\r\nwedded. The bride wished him to wear his gorgeous new uniform, but when\r\nhe came down to give her away he wore the old Continental buff and blue\r\nand no doubt all loved him better so. Often thereafter the pair were at\r\nMount Vernon and there on November twenty-seventh a little daughter came\r\nas the first pledge of their affection. As always there was much\r\ncompany. In August came a gallant kinsman from South Carolina, once\r\nColonel but now General William Washington of Cowpens fame, and for\r\nthree days the house was filled with guests and there was feasting and\r\nvisiting. November fifteenth Washington \"Rode to visit Mr. now Lord\r\nFairfax,\" who was back from England with his family, and the renewal of\r\nold friendships proved so agreeable that in the next month the families\r\ndined back and forth repeatedly.\r\n\r\nNor did the Farmer cease to labor or to lay plans for the future. He\r\nentered into negotiations for the purchase of more land to round out\r\nMount Vernon and surveyed some tracts that he owned. On the tenth of\r\nDecember he inclosed with a letter to Anderson a long set of\r\n\"Instructions for my manager\" which were to be \"most strictly and\r\npointedly attended to and executed.\" He had rented one of the farms to\r\nLawrence Lewis, also the mill and distillery, and was desirous of\r\nrenting the fishery in order to have less work and fewer hands to attend\r\nto; in fact, \"an entire new scene\" was to be enacted. The instructions\r\nwere exceedingly voluminous, consisting of thirty closely written folio\r\npages, and they contain plans for the rotation of crops for several\r\nyears, as well as specific directions regarding fencing, pasturage,\r\ncomposts, feeding stock, and a great variety of other subjects. In them\r\none can find our Farmer's final opinions on certain phases of\r\nagriculture. To draw them up must have cost him days of hard labor and\r\nthat he found the task wearing is indicated by the fact that in two\r\nplaces he uses the dates 1782 and 1783 when he obviously meant 1802\r\nand 1803.\r\n\r\nThere was no hunting now nor any of those other active outdoor sports in\r\nwhich he had once delighted and excelled, while \"Alas! our dancing days\r\nare no more.\" Happily he was able to ride and labor to the last, yet\r\nmore and more of his time had to be spent quietly, much of it, we may\r\nwell believe, upon the splendid broad veranda of his home.\r\n\r\nUnimaginative and unromantic though he was, what visions must sometimes\r\nhave swept through the brain of that simple farmer as he gazed down upon\r\nthe broad shining river or beyond at the clustered Maryland hills\r\nglorified by the descending sun. Perchance in those visions he saw a\r\nyouthful envoy braving hundreds of miles of savage wilderness on an\r\nerrand from which the boldest might have shrunk without disgrace. Then\r\nwith a handful of men in forest green it is given to that youth to put a\r\nContinent in hazard and to strike on the slopes of Laurel Hill the first\r\nblow in a conflict that is fought out upon the plains of Germany, in far\r\naway Bengal and on most of the Seven Seas. For an instant there rises\r\nthe delirium of that fateful day with Braddock beside the ford of the\r\nMonongahela when\r\n\r\n     \"Down the long trail from the Fort to the ford,\r\n     Naked and streaked, plunge a moccasined horde:\r\n     Huron and Wyandot, hot for the bout;\r\n     Shawnee and Ottawa, barring him out.\r\n\r\n     \"'Twixt the pit and the crest, 'twixt the rocks and the grass,\r\n     Where the bush hides the foe and the foe holds the pass,\r\n     Beaujeu and Pontiac, striving amain;\r\n     Huron and Wyandot, jeering the slain,\"\r\n\r\nThe years pass and the same figure grown older and more sedate is taking\r\ncommand of an army of peasantry at war with their King. Dorchester\r\nHeights, Brooklyn, Fort Washington, Trenton, Princeton, Brandywine,\r\nValley Forge, Monmouth, Morristown, the sun of Yorktown; Green, Gates,\r\nArnold, Morgan, Lee, Lafayette, Howe, Clinton, Cornwallis--what\r\nmemories! Lastly, a Cincinnatus grown bent and gray in service leaves\r\nhis farm to head his country's civil affairs and give confidence and\r\nstability to an infant government by his wisdom and character.\r\n\r\nHere, with bared heads, let us take leave of him--a farmer, but \"the\r\ngreatest of good men and the best of great men.\"\r\n\r\nTHE END\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nINDEX\r\n\r\nAdams, Abigail, letter of husband to about Washington's retirement, 306.\r\nAdams, John: believes Washington was made by marriage with Custis money,\r\n     16; on Washington's retirement, 306.\r\nAgue, prevalence of along the Potomac, 65.\r\nAlfalfa, _see \"Lucerne\"_.\r\nAlton, John, a servant of Washington's, 170, 174, 175.\r\nAnderson, James: manager of Mount Vernon, 181, 182; sends list of the\r\n     increase of slaves, 194; mentioned by Parkinson, 276; remains with\r\n     Washington, 307; final instructions to, 315.\r\n_Anna_, brings indentured servants from Ireland, 167.\r\n_Annals of Agriculture_ used by Washington, 71, 72; nature of, 74;\r\n     plan of drill published in, 107; Washington begins to read, 116;\r\n     plan of barn in, 117; threshing machine described in, 126.\r\n_A Practical Treatise of Husbandry_: used by Washington, 71; its\r\n     author, 73.\r\n\r\nBarrel plough: Washington makes one, 107; operation of, 108-110.\r\nBartram, John, Washington obtains plants from, 159.\r\nBassett, Fanny, matrimonial adventures of, 177, 180.\r\nBater, Philip, Washington agrees to let him get drunk on certain days, 169.\r\nBath (Berkeley Springs): Washington's land at, 28; Patty Custis taken to,\r\n     223.\r\nBear, one chased by the hounds, 257.\r\nBelvoir, fox hunting dinners at, 258.\r\nBernard, John, peculiar meeting of with Washington, 310-312.\r\nBishop, Sally: Custis' story of, 171-173; marries Thomas Green, 173;\r\n    later history of, 174.\r\nBishop, Thomas, history of, 170-173.\r\nBixby, Thomas K., owns the Lear papers, 86.\r\n\"Blueskin,\" one of Washington's war horses, 132, 133.\r\nBoard of Agriculture: Washington elected honorary member\r\n     of, 84; he is influenced by example of, 128.\r\nBooker, William:  makes threshing machine for Washington,\r\n     126, 127; mentioned, 308.\r\nBoston Athenaeum, buys Washington relics, 86.\r\n_Boston_, British frigate, Washington sells bull to, 144.\r\n\"Botanical Garden\": used for experimental purposes,  106;\r\n     location of, 161.\r\nBoucher, Jonathan, teaches John Parke Custis, 225.\r\nBowen, Cavan, indentured servant, bought, 167.\r\nBowling Green: laid out by Washington, 154; mentioned, 161.\r\nBox hedge, doubtful history of, 160, 161.\r\nBraddock, Gen.
